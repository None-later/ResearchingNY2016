Quiet? . . .

“Isnt’ this a relief. year? Gee, things are calm
this year.” Thats what many people have been
saying abottt State‘s first semester, comparing it
in thei‘. minds with last year.

There have been several differences between this
year and last. The ﬁrst, and most obvious lack,
has been cattsed by the changing of rushing to
second semester. The congregating of girls at
Minerva at noon, the busy, sorority-filled Boul
are gone. It is too early to evaluate the change in
rushing, but at present, it seems to be better for
the freshmen, at least, not to be pushed into the
conflict until they know their way around.

Second, we have different personalities in the
student executive positions. There are people who
generate electricity and conflict around them. atid
there were many such last year. There are others
who work quietly and efficiently. and in harmony.
as some of our SA leaders have done this year.

Thirty warnings were issued to freshmen this
year first semester (according to News records).
as against 40 last year. Rivalry is as active as last
year. Meanwhile. the same old complaints are
made. Everybody talks about it btit no one (ft)(‘.\‘
anything.

So far, so good. These differences are changes
for the better. But all of the inactivity has not
been due simply to the efficiency of government.
and general excellence of participation.

We have divided oitr business and entertain-
ment assemblies, bttt what have we done with those
devoted to business? $1,162.32 has been appropri-
atcd frotn the surplus. The appropriations have in
two cases been additions to the budgets approved
last spring; soccer was established as a varsity
sport. The point is. few questions were asked and
there was little discussion on any of these. is this
because everyone present 111 .»\sscmbly knew all
about the requests?

An examination of the money spent from their
budgets by various organizations shows that. al-
most at the half year. there arc six organizations
which 111ch spent less than 1/3 of their budgets.
if money is necessary to activity. and it must be
or the money Would not be rcqticstcd. that means
that these organizations are inactive. ()1in two
of the six Would normally expect to spend llic
greater part of their budgets second scincstcr.
While organizations should certainly not spend
money unless there is a need. not using it indicates
that they are not doing what it was expected they
would do when plans for this yczii‘ \vcrc made.

'l'hcsc organizations. and others. are set up to
meet student needs for additional educational fa.
cilitics and experience. Presumably the need cx-
ists or the organization should tint.

'i‘hcrc has lit't'll lililtli\'ll_\’ elsewhere. Last year.
it was generally dctidcd that thc (‘onstitution
needed a lot of filling tip of htH‘tlllt‘tl loop holes.
Aside from tltc three zuncndmcnts carried ovcr
from last spring, nothing has been suggested. And
what about the clarification of the tlllilcs of .\l\'s-
kania which was discussed so enthusiastically3'

['pon analysis, it seems that it has been a quiet
scnicstci'. And some of ilic sclf~satisfnction is just-
ilicd. lint, we cannot afford to lose illlt‘i't'si. let
things just slidc along, or say "lci (it-orgt- do it,"
That. has been happening. and explains much of
the "quiet" of this semester.

Rabbit pounded his gavel smart-
ly for attention. “The floor is open
for motions.” he said briskly. and
blinked.

There was commotion in the rear
of the hall. Tigger bounced upright
and waved a white paper. “If
everyone’s seen this. I move we ex-
pediate three thousand dollars for
a watercress team. That's what
Tiggers like to do best.”

“I second that.” said R00, not
quite understanding what a water-
cress team really was. “It has been
moved and seconded." Rabbit be-
gan. “And if there isn‘t any dis-
cussion—” “——Just a minute,” said

voice from the rear. and Eeyor
stumbled to his feet. "Inasmuch as,
and in consideration of, therefore
I—" “You're out of order, Eeyor,”
Piglet hissed excitedly, and Eeyor
said, “Oh, pardon me," and sat
down.

“It. has been moved and second.-
ed that we incorporate three thou
sand dollars for the establishment
of a watercress team,“ said Rabbit.
“IF there isn’t any further dis-
cussion, we shall go to a vote." and
he babbled on and on about Keep-
ping Our Heads and Following to
the Left, etc.

Pooh. who had been sitting very
still all this time, nudged Piglet
and whispered, “What's it all about,
Piglet?" “I don‘t know," Piglet
whispered back. “They've got a ro-
tation on the floor." “They do?"
Pooh said interestedly. and craned

unlucky by those who are sup-
erstitious.

Marjorie Trelease '53, and

that today is lucky for them,
cause they were born on Fri—

The reason that Rosie Keller
freshman. upholds the supersti-
tion that bad hick follows the
breaking of mirrors is simply
this. She learned that the per-
son you saw in the mirror was
your evil self. When the mirror
broke. the evil one escaped and

his head to see what one looked
like. “Must be a small one." he
muttered after a. moment, and he
went back to sleep.

“In contradiction of the subject
before us,” Rabbit was saying, “All
those in favor say ‘aye’; imposed.
say 'nay'.” He rapped the gavel
again. "-In favor!” “AYE!” shouted
Tigger.

'Aye,” squeaked Roo. And, “Aye”,
said all of Rabbit's Friends and
Relations. “B”, mumbled Pooh, and
rolled over on the other side.
“BEE?” he shouted suddenly.
“BEE!” “BUNNY!” And he start-
ed for the door, pulling Piglet aft-
er him.

Rabbit stroked his whiskers con-
tentedly. The meeting had gone
off really well today, he thought,
and he began to pack his gavel
away until next; Friday as every-
one crowded out of the auditorium.
And he thought of Bigger Things.

“Ahem,” said a voice from just
behind him.

“Ahem.”

Rabbit turned around. “Ah. yes.
Eeyor." he said. “What is it?”

"Aren‘t you going to ask who's
imposed?" Eeyor asked.

Rabbit; started. “Yes. I did for-
get something. didnt I?" And he
went on packing away his gavel.

Pooh was trying to remember
what it. was he had been so ex—
cited about as he and Piglet walk—
ed along the hall. Finally he de-
cided that it must not have been
important so he began to sing a
song. “You know, Piglet." he said
in the middle of the second verse.
“That was really quite a nice one."

"A nice what?" Piglet asked.

“I think I’ll go again.” Pooh said.
“Only not too soon."

To the Editor:

In the past few weeks. seine of
the comments which have come to
Radio Council regarding one of its
programs. Capital Campus. indicate
a degree of misunderstandiiig
which we would certainly like to
rectify. More than just. giving ra-
dio experience. Radio Council is
cndeavoring. week after week. to do
good by acqttnlnting the entire lis-
tening area with life at SCT. The
Council is in a position to show
that our alma mater is interesting.
important. and qualified. We are
not merely “that teachers college
in Albany." Therefore the pro-
gram is not designed specifically
to entertain State students. but
rather for the larger purpose of
advancing 1111' College itself (and
the students iiidlrcctlyi.

As We have tried to make clear.
Ritdlo Council exists for the whole
school. We are anxiously hoping for
the day when Radio at State wil'
be the nucleus for all student, or-
ganizations. it will take time. but
with more cooperation. tnorc criti-
cism. ntid more ideas. it will hap-
pi-n.

 

 

Sincerely yours.
George 1. Kline

The Common-stator is given the widest latitude as
author of this column, although his viewpoints do
not necessarily reflect those of the Sun Com
ans.

THERE COMES A TIME . . .

In every freshmans life when he/she must go
through that hallowed tradition known as “rushing.”
This 15 supposedly a “get acquainted” period for trosh
and upperciassmen, but wed like to pomt out that
anyone interested in getting to know the frosh has
already done so without; the so-called stimulus of
rushing. So frosh, beware—be normal—it'll all be
over in ten days—then comes the reckoning.

AS ONE COLUMNIST TO ANOTHER. . . .

If you have a copy of last week’s News handy. take
a look at the Spectator column in the Sports section,
commenting on the removal of Varsity sports from
the Student Budget. We like the idea of the lower-
ing of the student tax that would be made possible
by this action. Also some other very good ideas if
they can be worked out practically.

PING PONG PROBLEM . . .

According to the Library officials. the Rivalry Ping
Pong game cannot be held at any time during library
hours, since the noise might disturb the studying of
SC students. The time has come for a choice—Ping
Pong or studying. Maybe we could have the game on
a Sunday afternoon. (Unless. of course, some eager
students come to the library then, too.)

JOKE TO END ALL JOKES . . .

The reason there aren't. any ash trays in the cafe-
teria is that. they might be a bad influence on the
morals and character of the Milne students.

LIFT THAT BARGE . . .

The new buildings going tip are a boon to State
in more ways than one. Maybe. and a very emphatic
maybe. students might be able to have summer jobs
working on the projects.

DRAPER DOIN‘S . . .

Next time you‘re walking through first floor Dl‘apcr
looking up at the ceilings, notice the shrewd border
designs just painted. Really impressive to strangers
coming into the school. Also, in lower Draper. the
traffic stopper driviig Tony mad was the “week-end
date" cartoon posted near the MAA bulletin board.
DROP IN THE COST OF LIVING . . .

For State students if the committee working on
the idea for discounts in Central Avenue stores works
out. It all depends on how the merchants feel about
it. Maybe the “good word" from you students shop-
ping there would help things along a bit.

ABOUT THAT BIG-4 MONEY

Some suggestions for its use made in Student
Council were an additional bulletin board for the
classes. tints allowing one for every two classes atid
eliminating the mess land you'll pardon the expres-
sionl of too many notices . . . making the cafeteria
a little more pleasant place in which to eat lunch
or grab that morning 100 cup of coffee . . . buying
more furniture for the Commons.

'l‘lME WAS . . .

When classes had to draft kids to work on Big-4‘s
but. not '52! Half an hour after the sign-up list for
committees was up. it. was almost ﬁlled. O.K. frosh.
your turn next. This i lay be the shot-in-the-arni that
Rivalry has been needing for a long time this year.
THAT MYSKANIA BASKETBALL TEAM . . .

Looks as though it might be undefeated this year.
Sparkcd by the cheering of “Dimples” Dttinblctoii
utid “Daddy Long Legs" Jones. the team has wmi
all its games so far this year.

YOU (‘()llLli HAVE HEAR!) A PIN DROP . . .

in Junior Ed. 22 class Wednesday. The topic 7
’l‘caching Sex Education in the Secondary Schools
of New York State. Compliments to the coiitiiiittcc
for arranging an interesting program. Pt‘l'iittps more

AND FINALLY . . .

We come to the torture known to most students as
