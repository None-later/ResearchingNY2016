State Meets

New Paltz

in Return Tilt At Page

Peds Drop Two
Over Weekend

Tomorrow night in Page Hall. the

.varsity takes on New Paltz for the

second time this year. State won
the first game 59-50 as Jim War-
den paced the team with 18 points.
Milt Jackson lead New Paltz with
13 points scoring 7 of them on foul
shots.

State may be missing the service
of Capt. Marzello who hurt his
spine .in the last few minutes of
Saturday’s game.

New York State Maritime Acad-
emy and Willimantic State Teach-
ers defeated Albany State Teach-
ers in two games last Friday and
Saturday. The final scores were
81-69 in favor of Maritime and 71-
70 in favor of Willimantic.

Friday night Lorenz was main-
ly responsible for State's defeat. A
left-handed hook being his main
shot. Lorenz scored a total of 32
points which incidentally is the
highest amount scored by any one
player against State this year.

Warden Cheeks Van Dcrzcc

Jim Warden did a beautiful job
of guarding Van Derzee, the Mar—
itime star. He held Van Derzee to
just two foul shots in the first
half and only a total 01 10 points
in the whole game. In the previous
game between the two teams, Van
Deree scored 26 points as com-
pared to State's game total of 27
points. Link Marzello paced State's
attack with 16 points. all of which
were scored in the second half.
Warden and Tabor were the other
two statesmen to reach the double
figures. each netting 14 points.

Saturday night. State lost a very
tough game in the last few sec-
onds when Kaminski of Williman-
tic. sank a foul shot to break a
70-70 tie. This capped off a great
performance by Kaminski who
scored 29 points and controlled the
backboards. Three other Willim-
mantic players reached the double
figures. Marzello with 15 points
again led State‘s attack; Jim War-
den and Jim Coles followed with
14 points each.

Jiusio Breaks 600 Triple;
Potter Sets Game Mark

Records are falling by the
wayside this year, as the men’s
intramural bowling league en-
ters the stretch. The 246 which
Dave Clark bowled on Decem-
ber 8th still stands as high
single. but Jim Jiusto came,
close to breaking that. too, as
he knocked over a 232 single
for Potter. He did blast the
triple record, to set it at 614,
and led his team to break their
own team record with an even
900 Jinsto was helped on that
second game by Rockhill’s 182
and Eich‘s 184. Blviano and
Davey also bowled.

S.LL. still leads the league
with a record of 9 and 0 but
Potter and the EEPS are close
behind with 11 and 1. On
Thursday S.L.S. met the EEPS
and Potter bowled the Beavers
who are currently in fifth
place.

Saturday Action
To Feature IM
Basketball Slate

The two intramural basketball
league leaders went into action
yesterday as the last half of the
loop schedule got into full swing.

VanDerzee, powerful undefeated
“B” league leaders. took on the
KB quintette, while Potter, on pap-
er the strongest club in either
league, met the potentially formi-
dable Suspenders. In the other
game. the Redskins faced the Com-
mutors in a “B” League fracas.

Three more games are on tap
for tomorrow afternoon, when SLS
meets the Beavers in the first
game, the Lovers take on the Finks,
and the Rams play the Rocks. The
first game is scheduled for 2:30.

Under SNAFU conditions. three
games were played t?) in Page
last Monday night. Los Locos. back
in winning form after absorbing a
shellacking from VanDerzee, ran
their two game total to 100 points
by trampling the Commutors, 49-
20. Bob Pctrule had 15 to pace the
winners. while Joe Pasquarella net-
cd 8 points to lead the Commuters.
The 10scrs played probably their
best game of the year. but lost be-
cause Los Locos were hitting on an
exceptionally high percentage of
their shots.

In the second game of the night.
played over an hour late because
of the fouled up conditions caused
by the new “anti-thief" regulations,
the Bulls smashed KDR, 38-23. The
game, yet to be declared official.
was almost a runaway for the Bulls.
as KDR shots refused to go through
the nct. The Angels played the
Fresh to a 36-36 tie. so the game
will be replayed on January 16.

Bowlers Down
Pharmacy Twice;

Remain ln Third

Siena chlcrs Triumph
ln Rc-schedulcd Match

Obstacles of every kind, particu-
larly in the form of splits. misses,
and new pins, were placed in the
path of the Statesman Wednesday
night at the Playdium. But the
Varsity bowling squad survived
these setbacks long enough to
squeeze out a two-to-one victory
over the cellar-dwelling Pharma-
clsts.

In chalking up their two wins.
the Teachers were very fortunate
that their opponents were also hav-
ing a streak of hectic luck. name-
ly splits. misses. and new pins. The
locals had a splendid opportunity
to gain a. full game on the league-
leading Siena Indians who also
dropped one game out of three.
Their competition was supplied by
ABC. Due to current exams. Law
School and RPI postponed their
scheduled match.

Averages ’lake Nose-Dive

All of the State averages took a
slight nose-dive as Don McDonald
was the only member of the crew
to approacn 500. In fact. McDon-

- ald‘s 498 was high for the entire

match. Bob Reno’s 183 was good
for high single honors among the
locals, but Mintzer of Pharmacy
topped him with a sole of 186.

Last Thursday the much-discuss-
ed postponed match between Siena
and State was rolled off at the
u'lElelUlTl. Although the Teachers
supplied the Indians with plenty of
action. the Siena quintet came out
on top with two victories and one
setback.

Second Game Thriller

The first game found the
Indians rolling over the statesmen
by a wide margin, but the second
game. which. in the opinion of
many, was the most thrilling game
the Teachers have participated in
this season, was a come-from-be-
hind victory for the locals by a
more total of five pins. In the fi—
nale. Siena edged their opposition
by thirteen pins to register their
second win of the afternoon. Lyle
Walsh bowled very consistently in
racking up a neat 541 including
games of 186. 176. and 179. Mc-
Donald with 511 and Don Burt with
486 were next in line.

The statesmen are still in third

 

place, trailing the pace-setters by
four games.

JV Loses Twice
in Close Games,-
Suspenders Win

While State's Varsity was drop-
ping two games over the weekend.
the Jayvee bowed to Albany Bus-
iness College’s Varsity. at Page, on
January 8th, and then traveled to
Glens Falls to lose a close decision
to the Skidmore team.

The Friday tilt against ABC
was a 68-42 affair that saw the
visitors ahead at half-time by ten
points. and never in serious troub-
le. The Businesmen had tw0 big
guns in Westerland, with 17. and
Contine with 15. For State. Wei-
gand with 11 and Golden with 9.

vees were eked out 50-47, after

10; but the Skidmore aggregation
had two men break into the double
figures. besides consistent hitting
from the rest of the team. These
haVe been the first games the team
has played since before the Christ-
mas vacation.

The preliminary game on Satur-
day was played between the Sus-
penders. an intramural league team
with a record of 2-2. and Trinity
Boys' Club, a recreational club
team. managed and paced in the
game by Kenny George of State.
The Home team. led by Pierce Mc-
Grath's seven field goals and Dave
Lennick's 12 points. put the game
on ice by the start of the fourth
period. The Suspenders led the
Trinity Institute team at the half :
25-20.

Rivalry Bowling
Set For Jan. 17

The all-important Rivalry Bowl-
ing match is scheduled for Tues-
day. January 17th. 4 o'clock on the
Playdium alleys. Since the rivalry
score is tied at this time, it is ex-
pected that the two rival classes
will turn out in full force. although
cheering will not be judged. and
the teams should be out for blood.

Last year the girls of the class
of 1952 were victorious but the men
dropped their match to '51.

The respective classes have sign-
up sheets on their class bulletin
boards and play-offs will be this
weekend, to see who makes the
team. The Soph girls have had. a
turn-cut of approximately 20 girls,
and this number will be cut to six,
as the: will be a the—member
team with our acting as substitute.

One point for the men and one
for the women will be awarded to
the team winning two out of three
games.

Rivalry swimming and basketball
for both men and women will be
played off during the second semes-
ter, but are as yet unscheduled.

In athletic event:, this year the
fresh have taken: four points for
campus day field events. two for
pushbail. and two for girls’ field
hockey The Sophs have taken two
for football, two for girls' volley-
ball. and two for the mens' volley-
ball game.

 

‘7’“ spook?”

_ By runway Minx

Last week I gave my opinionon
one solution to the varsity athletic
problem; today I would like to give
several more facts and how we can
work towards our goal.

Most colleges and universities
throughout the country belong to
the NCAA (National Collegiate Ath-
letic Association) and it is a com-
mon custom to schedule games
among themselves. Each year more
and more teams are joining the
NCAA which makes it harder for a
non-member to schedule games. We
can't join the NCAA because of
student control. Not that the stu-
dents won't give their support, but
in order to become a member we
must have our own athletic associ-
ation as a separate legal organiza-
tion. There is only one solution to
this problem.

Committee to Investigate Problem

Before next semester gets to far
under way I think a student-fac-
ulty committee should be appoint-
ed to investigate the situation. The
sooner the better.

Although it may seem to be a
small matter to you, the laundry
cost would be lowered also. Last
year the Dry Cleaning bill alone
came to $75. If we had our own or-
ganization a small group can handle
the cleaning of towels, sweat suits.
etc., and the expense would be cut
besides giving jobs to students. Each
year about $900 is spent for trans-
portation. if we were a separate or-
ganization a bus could be bought
and after the initial cost was paid
the expense would be lowered con-
siderably. Just another reason for
separate contiol.

Here Are the Facts

One or two interesting facts about
this year’s basketball team. .
our offensive record is 56.4 points a,
game . . . defensive record is 58.9 a
game . . . team’s trouble seems to
be in foul shooting—only scoring
on 53”: of the free shots . . . team
total is 118 out of 221 . . . Kaehn
leads team with a .678 average.
Brown second with .620 . . . how-
ever there are several players under
the .500 mark . a better foul
shooting record would have been
the difference Saturday night. Sev-
eral comments heard around the
college have been about a lack of
fight under the boards by some of
the players.

The junior varsity looked good
for the first three periods against
the powerful ABC varsity Friday
night. Several of ABC's team have
played on some topnotch teams.
However Saturday night at Skid-
more the team had a hard time.
Potter Riskcd Record

Potter Club risked an unbeaten
record on the basketball court last
night against the Suspenders. The
record started back in ’46. The Sus-
penders played Trinity Institute as
the first game Saturday night and
will be one of the top teams Potter
has to play this year.

Rea-Schedule Rivalry Ping Pong,-
To Compete In Singles, Doubles

Rivalry Ping pong games have
been re-schcduled for 7 p. m. Thurs-
day, in the Commons. according to
William Lyons ‘50, Chairman of the
Rivalry Committee. There will be
two sets of three games each played
by both the men's and women's
singles. Men and women will each
