new clothing and medical supplies
was sent to that city. The Albany-
Nijmegan Committee now hopes to
preserve the relationship established
between the two cities, by the logical
exchange of letters between the
young people of the cities, according
to Dr. Rich.

The government of the Nether-
lands is sending to the State Col-
lege library a small number of books
on Nijmegan. The library is arrang-
ing. in addition, a display for the
library showcase. Several copies of
a small book published in the Neth-
erlands, called The Reconstruction
of the Netherlands, have been placed
in the Library, and copies are also
available at the exchange rack of
the Publications Ofﬁce.

An exhibit of Dutch glassware has
been loaned to. and is on display at
the Albany Institute of History and

The ﬁrst world premier ,and an
event of great theatrical importance
in Albany, is the presentation of a
new play, “Congressional Baby,” by
Eileen Tighe, at the Playhouse,
opening Tuesday, February 28 for
two weeks prior to its Broadway
opening. The play will be produced
by Malcolm Atterbury and directed
by Eddie Dowling.

One of the leading roles will be
played by the distinguished young
actress, Nina Foch, star of stage and
screen. The male lead will be played
by Neil Fitzgerald, whose stage ap-
pearances have included “Without
Love” and “Ten Little Indians."

There will be no change in prices
for this attraction, so why not take
advantage of the special student
rates?

Now for some listening news.

here, or a sports event there, will
not solve the problem. It has not
thus far.

Regardless of what is done, how-
ever. I still think that the less com-
plaining that the Sophomores and
the freshmen do (this year or any
year) and the more action that they
take on any constructive criticisms
will net some proﬁtable results. If
you’re too busy to work on the prob-
lem then forget about it. But it
would be a good idea for everyone
to quit doing a lot of aimless com-
plaining about it.

Unofficial ’Open Houses’
Resuli In Two Robberies

Open houses are a tradition
with the group houses on camp-
us but last week two mysteri-
ous persons took the initiative
to visit Psi Gamma and Sayles
Annex, strictly unofficially.
However, the visitor to Sayles
Annex fared better than the
one at l’si Gam since he did
not meet any opposition. The
boys were acquiring their edu-
cation at the time and since
they have blind faith in hum-
anity the front door is never
looked. When inventory was
taken after the robbery, a cameo
ring, valued at $70, an electric
clock, and $17 in cash were
among the missing. The intrud-
er also tried his hand at safe-
cracking (on a very small scale
of course) and removed $10
from a locked cedar box after
totally demolishing the lock.

At Psi Gamma the intruder
met Mary Calandra '50. and
made off with $8 before her
screams drove him away.
