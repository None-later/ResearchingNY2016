If Mr. Gallup, of Gallup Poll
fame, were to visit «this institution,
he might be struck by numerous
new faces of frosh and transfer
students. Now, knowing that Mr.
Gallup has an inquisitive nature.
we would suspect that he might ask
some of these lads and lassies, their
opinion of State. As Mr. Gallup has
had experience in stating questions
he would ask. “Give with the dope;
whatcha think about de situation?"

 

 
 
   

guests. mum-(x

  

Letlsyface it! Gallup’s poll would
not get everybody, so we've asked a
few on our own, to supplement “Mr.
Gallup’s Poll.”

Marge Leonard, a transfer from
St. Rose, says, “I think State is
wonderful so far."

Dorothy Shurtleff. beginning
freshman from Schenectady, states,
“This college life is confusing. I
haven’t had a chance yet to really
form an opinion, but so far every-
thing seems okay.

A transfer from Siena College,
Eddie Le Blanc, contributes his op-
inion, saying, "I'm very impressed
by the friendly atmosphere here.
Teachers are very friendly and
seem very willing to help you.”

Another transfer, Patricia Gard-
ner '52, from New Jersey College for
Women, Rutgers University, has
been here only for a short time.
She has been able to form but a
tentative opinion. She finds State
a friendly place, including profes-
sors.

Catherine Hodges ’52. transfer
from an elementary college. is reg-
istered 1n State’s Library School.
She has heard that the work here
isn't a bed of roses, but thinks that
she’ll like it.

Last, but certainly not least, two
Brooklynites, Joan Pearson and
Anita Lilcnfeld, voice their opinions.
They are not confused by the hust-
ling of people to classes and those
mad dashes to the “Boul.” Far be
it from them to get flustcred. Down
Brooklyn way they get used to
crowds rushing hither and thither.
Anita likes about everything here—
the teachers, kids. courses and the
atmosphere. Joan finds it a little
early to form an opinion, but so
far the horizon looks bright and
inviting.

All polls have to end some place,
be they Gallup or otherwise. We de-
cided to end ours here. with State
holding the upper hand. Hope you

Delhi Aggies Swamp Junior Varsity,-
Scobie Tops Victory With 30 Points

After a three week lay off the
Junior Varsity basketball team trav-
eled to Delhi Wednesday to tackle
the Delhi Aggics. The long lay off
made the team rusty and “off”;
was this more than any other thing
that led to the 78—58 defeat.

61*

The Aggies were sparked by Paul
Scobic who scored 18 of his 30
points in the first quarter. Scobic hit
on an extremely high percentage of
his shots and undoubtedly had a
“hot” hand. Poor defense and slop-
py ball handling made the Delhi
victory all the easier. Several times
a Delhi player stole the ball to go
the length of the court for the score.

The scoring started after 31 sec-
onds of play when Widanka fouled
Art Goldin and Goldin made the
free shot. However Scobic gave the
lead to Delhi ten seconds later on
a. hook shot and except for a ino-
ment in the second (murtcr. the Ag-
gics wcrcn't prcsscd too hard. Sco-
bic hooked in another basket. set
for a third. scored on a rebound,
and mode two foul shots before
State could score again: this time
Bisson connected with a set to make
the score 10-3 in favor of thc Aggics.
With Scobic scoring 18 of the 22
points in the ﬁrst, quarter for Delhi.
and Stulc nimble to get going, the
quarter ended with State trailing
22-10.

Scolch was held to four points in
the second quarter but. the poor
rebounding of State lct Dclhi keep
their lead. Ncwt Owens was the only
Stulcsnmn who was getting any rc-
bounds with consistency. Burns

McCarthy hit for State to bring the
score to 28-22 ,but Delhi came back
and the half ended 37-26 in favor
of he home team.

State took the jump at the start
of the second half and Bisson scored
on a jump shot but the Aggies came
back and came back hard. They
rolled up a 63-41 third quarter score.
At. the start of the last period State
looked good for a few minutes and
closed the gap slightly but Delhi
went on a scoring spree and took a
73-47 lead. Burns connected on a
lay-up. Owens drove the length of
the court for a score and Burns
made two foul shots to cut the lead
to 75-53. At this point Delhi tried
to put on a freeze. They succeeded
for a while but it was broken up,
although this made no difference in
the ﬁnal oucomc.

The ﬁnal score was 78-58 with
Scoblc taking all honors as the
game‘s outstanding player. Burns' 12
was tops for State. Owen and Goldin
each hit for 11. Tonight at 7:30 pm.
the two tennis meet again. The game
will be played in Page.

Varsity Meets
Onconta State

Strive To Redeem
'Close Road Trip Loss

Tonight the Onconta “Red Drag-
ons” invade Page Hall for a return
engagement. Onconta won the first
game. 62-54. but they had to come
from behind to do it. State had a
30-27 half-time lead and it was only
in the last f’:‘,\' minutes that Onconta
took the lead. Although the “Feds”
lost the game they outscored Oneon-
ta in field goals, 24-21. It was the
foul shooting that won the game.

The “Red Dragons" are the only
undefeated college basketball team

ready accepted a bid to play in the
first annual Optimist Club Basket-
ball tourney at Utlca on the 8th and
9th of March. The Dragons are an-
other tall team; Ray Crane is their

stand over six feet. However, Jacob-

son. the high scorer, is only 5’10".

New Haven Downs State, 52-38

Saturday night State avenged an

State Teachers' by the count of 52-
38. .,

Slate blew a half-time lead of 19-

tclns and Curdillo scored 18 apiece
for the winners. Vartclns made 16
of his counters in the second half

Bowlers Drop .

Siena F inale; ’

Lose 2nd Place

McDonald's 196-559
Paces State’s Squad,
Schott Hits Siena 216

In their final meeting of the sea-
son. Siena eliminated the State Var-
sity bowling team as a possible con-
tender for ﬁrst place in the Inter-
collegiate leaguc. Although the
Teachers made a valiant attempt.
the competition proved to be a bit
too strong as Siena trounced the
locals in three out of three games
Wdenesday night at the Playdium.
The statesmen provided plenty of
competition, but an onrush of strikes
by the Siena keglers in the latter
frames of each game sewed up the
three-game set for the Indians. In
the ﬁrst contest of the evening,
State breezed into the tenth frame
with a comfortable lead, but a mer-
ciless attack by the opposition pro-
vided them with a seventeen pin de-
cision. The third game was another
tilt that was decided in the tenth
frame, but by a somewhat wider
margin.

It was no poor bowling that de-
feated the statesmen, but streaks
of red-hot Indian fire. Don McDon-
ald racked up a beautiful total of
559 for his three-game effort includ-
ing such games as 196, 177 and 186.
His consistently good bowling was
one of the bright spots of an other
wise dismal evening. Don Burt reg-
istered a triple of 482 to rank sec-
ond among the statesmen. while
Lyle Walsh followed with 468. The
high single game for the locals was
McDonald's 196. but Schott of the
Indians racked up two totals of 200
or better. 216 and 202. Perhaps his
578 effort was the most important
single factor in Siena’s three-game
win.

RPI lost ground in their struggle
for ﬁrst place. as they dropped two
games to the lowly Pharmacists.
This defeat may prove costly to the
pennant hopes of the Engineers.
Law forfeited their match with
ABC; in fact. Law has withdrawn
from the league for the remainder
of the season. This move automatic-
ally cancelled all of their postponed
matches and their three remaining
matches of the schedule. All of the
squads in the league beneﬂtted
greatly with the exception of State.
The majority of the clubs receive
six unopposed games as compared
to three for the Teachers.

Exums are over! Life is back to
normul and winter sports have be-
gun ngnln. WAA's program will ex-
lend until the Easter vouctlon.

Did you know that WAA hus skis
that anyone can borrow. or that
credit is given for skating? This your
we have. both snow and ice. and
this is it good opportunity to have
fun und eurn credit at. the some
time. All of these hours can be un-
supervised so you can take the sklls
us fur us Cunudu if you wont.

Combined with MAA. the Tuni-
bllng und Fencing clubs are contin-

5 uing. What could be u better way

to gain ugillty and poise?

Ping-pong and swimming are also
continuing. Surely you can find an
evening at week to spend on some
recreation!
