Want some cigarettes? Free cigar-
ettes? Statistics prove :that free
cigarettes appeal to more people
than any other kind. Well, here’s
your big chance to get some, and
with good luck and brains, you
can’t miss.

First of all, there’s the Chester-
field Telephone Quiz Contest. Next
Monday night I'm going to pick at
random from the Directory five
people to call. They will be asked
the Chesterfield question of the
week, “Who was the only President
of the United States, who was a
bachelor?" If the first person called
answers the question correctly, he
will receive two packs of Chester-
fields. If he happens to miss it, and
the second person called gives the
right answer. he will receive four
packs. If none of the five people
called answers the question cor-
rectly, the ten packs will be added
to the next week's contest. It’s as
simple as all that. So if the phone
rings on Monday night between
6:45 pm. and 7:15 pm. put on
your thinking cap. It may be “Ches-
ter-field’s Calling."

Seen the little red box with ABC
on it down by the Commons? It’s
for your empty Chesterfield wrap-
pers. No, it's not the latest in waste
baskets, it's all part of the Chester-
field “Happy Birthday Contest."
Each of twelve weeks has been des-
ignated as a month of the year.
This week is for all April birthdays,
and any student whose birthday
falls in April is eligible for this
week’s contest. Just write your name
and address on the back of an emp-
ty Chesterfield wrapper and drop
it in the box. On Monday at 9:30
a. m. a name will be drawn from
the box, and the winner will re-
ceive a “Happy Birthday" carton of
Chesterfields. The January, Febru-
ary and March contests have been
run in the past three weeks. so it’s
too late for anyone with birthdays
then. Incidentally, Bob Donnelly
’52, won the January contest, Bill
Taylor '53, the February contest,
and George Waldbillig ’5', March.
So let’s have everyone saving wrap-
pers, and dropping them in the lit-
tle red box by the Commons. It
may be your week to win!

English Students Gather
For First ’Moior’ Evening

“She died after the beautiful
snow melted,

And they buried her under the
slush.”

50 Dr. Shields Mellwalne wel-
comed a gathering of English
faculty and majors Wednesday
night in the Lounge, who had
waded through to the first of
English Evenings.

The address of the evening
was given by Dr. Harry W.
Hastings, Professor Emeritus of
English, who gave his concept
of "How One Becomes An Eng-
lish Major." He included anec-
dotes and a George Ade fable
to point out that it is personal
experience rather than set
courses that determines one’s
major.

Refreshments were served by
the ladies of the faculty.

A student committee to work
on more such evenings was
formed, consisting of Arline Bel-
kin, Grad, Donald Jalbert '50.
Fred Knoerzer ’51, and Joan
Tantum '52.

Step right up Ladies and
Gentlemen and view the eighth
wonder of the world. And on the
left we have . . . Yes, through-
out Statc Fair night the gay
(and noisy) carnival atmosphere
was maintainer] by the crowds
and the concessions.

l’ottcr started the festivities
with a lovely bunch of coconuts,
“Mickey Films," and “Bcsamc
Mucho." Their talents extended
to taking in the most money
for the night.

The Refreshment situation
was capably handled by Beta
Zeta’s Chinese Tea. Garden. The
Religious Clubs Booth (who
strung all of those peanuts),
lGC's Pizza :1 la. Italianc, The
Bicrgartcn. and many. many
other places for similar pur-

Did you take Pierce Hall‘s

probably helped to make their

evening from it "fair" category.

If a man is to receive bids he was
notified yesterday through student
mail. This bid must be picked up
this morning in the auditorium be-
lwccn the hours of 9 a. m. and 12:35
p. m. Bids must be returned Monday
bctwvcn lhc same hours to the
table in lhc auditorium. where rcp-
rcsrnlativcs of each of the frater-
nitics will be located. Failure to pick
up or return a bid excludes a man

Previously. freshmen were bid
