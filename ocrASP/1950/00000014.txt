One of the basic aims of the Ex-
change Department this year has
been to stimulate interest in the
student activities of foreign univers-
ities, to promote an international
consciousness on the undergraduate
level. It is necessary that college
students develop this international
spirit to further understanding and
peace. In an attempt to help fulﬁll
this aim, newspaper exchanges have
been established with Canada, Eng-
land, Germany, Switzerland; while
Mexico, Italy, China, and Russia,
and at least ten others are expected
to come through momentarily.

It is interesting to ncte that the
foreign universities have already
made internationalism an important
part of their college living. Many of
their editorials reflect their attitude
toward communism; federations of
student bodies on national and iii-
ternational bases are advocated. The
McGill University, Montreal, Cana-
da, one of our closest foreign ex-
changes, is extremely indicativc of
a university acutely aware of the
world and its place in it.

The National Federation of Ca-
nadian Students, an important or-
ganization on campus, holds as its
aims: “——To promote a better under-
standing among students; a greater
degree of co-operatlon between all
Canadian universities for the pro-
motion of national interests; and to
provide a means for developing iii-
ternational relationships with stu-
dent groups iii other countries."

“Should we join the International
Union of Students?" was recently
one of the most controversial issues
on campus. In an unofficial meeting
of the NFCUS the students favored
affiliation to IUS by a vote of 35-25.
“Those who favor joining are inter-
ested in seeing Canadian students
take a mature place among the world
student community, wanting to have
their point of view heard. Those who

are against don’t want to have any-
thing to do with communism (which
is predominant in the IUS), think
joniing IUS will seriously weaken
NFCUS, and want to see us stay in
our own back yard.

"The NFCUS Committee is organ-
izing a survey to determine the
number of students interested in
spending their summer months in
Europe.”

The Student Christian Movement
held an inter-nation tea which was
attended by most of the 48 countries
in which the SCM has branches.

“It seems strange that McGill,
which is a most cosmopolitan uni-
versity, has not one group of serious
minded students interested in a
world government—." Soon after the
editorial appeared, a club was or-
ganized to understand and promote
world government.

Los Locos, VDZ Fight

State Triumpl'is

in ABC Finale,
Encounter TCC

Wednesday night the Varsity
bowling team overcame one of their
season’s jinxes as they triumphed
over ABC in two out of three games
at the Playdfum. On their last out-
ing, ABC trounced the Teachers in
each contest of the three game set.
But the statesmen gained sweet re-
venge this week as they registered
a tWenty-four pin victory in the
opener, and copped the finale by a
margin of forty-six pins. In the sec-
ond contest, the ABC keglers were
a bit too consistent as. they rolled
an impressive total of 843 to rack
up their only win of the evening.

Lyle Walsh copped the individual
honors by rolling a 510 triple con-
sisting of games of 156, 162, and
192. In an attempt to chalk up
a 500 total, Mike LaManna fell
three pins shy to record a com-
mendable total of 497. Don McDon-
ald came through with 473 including
a high game of 175. Walsh and
LaManna rolled single games of 192
and 187 respectively to take the lead
in the department.

Next week the statesmen are
scheduled to meet the Law School
representatives, but due to Law’s
withdrawal from the league. the
match has been cancelled and the
three games awarded to the Teach-
ers.

This Saturday night at the Play-
dium. the Varsity squad will bowl
a special match with'the Varsity
keglers of Triple Cities College. The
following week will see the scene of
action shift to Eiidicott where TCC
will play host to the Albanians. Ac-
cording to all reports, this will be
a good match, and college support
would be greatly appreciated.

The league standings in the In-
ter-collegiate loop remain the same
as they were last week. Siena is
still leading the field, with RPI
struggling to overtake them. Rest-
ing comfortably in third place two
games behind the Engineers ‘are the
Statesmcn who are currently feel-
fiig the breath of fourth place ABC
on their backs.
