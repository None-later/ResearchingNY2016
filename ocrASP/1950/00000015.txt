Students Proctor Exams, Broadcast Race Results, Take Ads

As Port-Time Employment Bureau Places State Job Seekers

By MARILYN RAPP

Do you need a job? If you do,
why not submit your name and
qualifications to Mrs. Annette P.
Malseed, who is in charge of the
student‘s employment bureau at
State. You never can tell what
might happen. The employment bu-
reau has helped many students to
obtain Jobs which not only have
raised their financial status but
which have also presented them
with unusual, entertaining, and
beneficial experiences.

Bill Lyons has obtained three
jobs through the bureau. He has
done proctoring at night examina-
tions at Russell Sage and has done
proctoring at psychology examina-
tions at Albany High for Russell
Sage. Also. he has tutored in plane
geometry, a student. who was at-
tending St. Rose College in the eve-
nings. At present, Bill is taking care
of a cottage at. 303 Western Avenue,
which is a dormitory for freshman
girls. Bill does such 0ch jobs as tak-
ing care of the fire, throwing out
trash, changing fuses. and taking
calls. Since Bill was also a house
boy at a girl's dormitory in his
freshman year. he states he has
formed a few theories on how wo—

men live but feels the newspaper
isn’t the pro-per .place for these par-
ticular facts.

Ken Orner received a position as
a Waterfront Director at Camp
Wakpominee, a Boy Scout summer
camp at Glens Falls. Before attend-
ing the camp, Ken was sent to the
National Aquatic School for Water-
front Directors at Mendaham, N. J.,
where he was taught to instruct
swimming, lifesaving,‘,rowing, and
canoeing. At the camp, Ken and his
assistant were in charge-of 294 boys
during the 6-week season. Also, Ken,
like other State students, has done
house to house survey work in the
capitol district area and has put
up storm windows, shoveled snow,
and washed windows.

Through the bureau, Serverina
Zawistowski obtained a job as an
ad taker with the classified depart-
ment of the Times Union. Severina
works fourteen hours a week. Sev-
erina meets some very interesting
people over the telephone. such as a
lady who calls up every Saturday to
put an ad in the paper for homes
for dogs and cats which she has
found throughout the week.

James Hawley worked at the be-
ginning oi‘ the college year for

WOKO as a radio announcer. His
working hours Were from 6 p. m. to
11:30 p. m. From 9 p.m. to 10 p.m.,
he helped to make up the music
schedule for a symphony hour. At
10:30 p.m. he has a sponsored neWs-
cast program for which he assem-
bled the news himself, editing it and
presenting it in the manner he
wished. Some days at 6:30 p.m. he
announced the race results, a job
which he sometimes mixed up since
Jim claims he wasn't familiar with
interpreting race results.

There jobs are samples of the type
of positions that may be obtained
through the employment bureau.
They prove that students will do
most anything to work their way
through college.

Juniors To Fill Activity Sheets
Belore March 6, Says Adams

Activities sheets will be passed out
to Juniors in Ed. 23 Wednesday.
Others who are eligible may pick
up forms in the Commons at the
absentee voting table on March 2
and 3. Forms should be returned
to Eleanor Adams ‘50, via Myskanla
mailbox not later than Monday,
March 6, at 4:30 p.m.

 

Debate Council
Asks For Funds

Today the financial motion grant-
ing Debate Council additional funds,
will be brought before the assem-
bly for discussion. Edwin Kurlander
'51, President of the Council, has
released the following statistics on
the budget this year.

The group has a balance of $5.21
from their budget for this year,
which was $355. They are request-
ing an additional sum of $250 .A
larger budget will enable them to
represent State College at the Re-
gional and perhaps National tour-
naments.

The expenditures up to this time
include: Trips, $279.50; Keys, $30.50;
Pedagcgue, $25; Stationary and
Postage, $5; Equipment, $7.50; Pub-
licity, $2.29. A total of $349.79 has
resulted.

The Champlain and Brooklyn
Tournaments this year will cost $175,
and the debates scheduled with Cor-
nell University. New York Univer-
sity, Yeshiva University. and others
require an expense of $25.

A sum of $50 is needed for re-
serve, which will be returned to col—
leges to whom the Council owes
money from past debates. Therefore
a grand total of $250 is requested.
