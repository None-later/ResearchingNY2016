Show Opinion Ol Hearing 'Red'

By GRACE SMITH

The results of the recent poll spon-
sored by the State College News on
whether the student body would
care to hear Dr. Henry J. Phillips.
an ex—professor and alleged Com-
munist. have been released. There
were 31 people opposed and 130 in
favor of hearing the speaker. Of the
31 people opposed, 14 of them wrote
comments, as did 50 of the 130 in-
dividuals in favor.

Some of the favorable comments
were as follows: “Yes. I would like
to hear Dr. Phillips. We will never

" W:
a (cf-come.”

 

ll'lllllll‘ti

understand Communists by ignoring
them, and a communist group driv-
en underground ls doubly danger-
ous.”

Another comment submitted to
the poll in favor of hearing Dr.
Phillips was “How can We criticize
a speaker or an idea if we do not
know his outlook on that idea. Ig-
norance of any ideal is not a good
thing for any school, much less
State."

One person said that the consid-
eration of the attitude of the City
of Albany and the press should be
made before sponsoring Such a
speaker.

Seine of the comments endorsed
by those opposed to hearing Dr.
Phillips are as follows: “Perhaps
you say. when we see a real, live
Communist, we can see just what he
is; and so in the future we might
be able to discern any such pesti-
lence because we have seen just this
one. This is wrong. I say that no
good can come from listening to
cvil.”

Another person stated "Inﬁltra-
tion will wear quickly cnough with-
out bringing such it spcakcr to a
Tuichcrs' Colicgc~ what will follow?
I imaginc that Communist llilllilllh
lcts will appear on the :niiipus a
couple of wccks latcr."

Most of tlic individuals opposcd to
hcariiigr thc spcakcr mad: comments
to ilic cll‘cct that a statc supporth
institution was no placc for a (for:-
mnnist spcakcr. Othcr pcoplc (pics-
tioncd the financial anglc ot‘ ll'.t'

TCC El<es Out
Win In Match
Willi Siolesmen

Last Saturday night was an event-
ful day 101' the athletes of Triple
Cities College, as they not only won
the Varsity basketball game. but
also edged the local bowling team
in a three game set at the Play-
diuiii. It was agreed before the
match that total pinnagc instead of
games won would designate the vic-
tor. Ironically. the statesmen won
two out of three games, but drop-
ch the decision by a total of sixty-
scycn plus. This can be inaliin cx-
plalncd by the fact that TCC reg-
istcrcd a 100 pin victory in the sec-
ond tilt. After the first contest had
been completed, the Teachers had
a 25 pin l‘ad, but the second game
placcd the visitors in front by a
trcnicndous margin. The locals tried
hard in the third game to overcome
thc 'I‘CC advantage. but their eight
p.u win did not decrease the margin
sutl'icicntly.

ltltchic of TCC and Bob Reno of
Static sharcd the individual honors
oi the evening. Checking in with
u 21:3 sinulc and a triple of 539. Rit-
cliic was high for the evening. Reno
rrgislci'i-d ginncs of 179. 148. and 183
to rack up a 510 for thc Statesmcn.
l.ylc Walsh y'as iuniicr up with a
triplc of 506 including single efforts
of 180. 190. and 136. Don McDon-
ald missed the 500 mark by two

Casatelli's Shot
Nips State’s J.V.

With two seconds left in the Jun-
ior Varsity basketball game against
Utica. Casatelli tossed in a despera-
tion one-hander to give Utica a 43-
42 win.

After leading throughout almost
the complete game and having a
one point lead with time just about
out the J.V.'s looked like they had
upset the strong Ut’s, but a game
isn’t over iiiitll the last second.

chand sank a lay—up to start
the scoring of the first quarter. He
followed with a foul shot and Gold-
cn hit with a one handcr to glva
State a 5-0 lead before Utica could
score. However the first quarter
produced little scoring and ended
up 6-5 in states favor. The second
period was a nip and tuck affair
as the lead changed hands six times
before Owens set and hit to give
the home team a 16-15 lead. Owens
scored again as the half drew to an
end. and State left the court lead-
ing 18-15.

Casatcli Paces Utica

In the third quarter State kept
its lead bill only by the slimmest
margin. Goldcii's one handcrs and
Owcns‘ set and lay-up kept Statc
ahcad. When the quarter ended
Utii‘a traiicd 29-27. McGory startcd
things rolling iii the last quarter
with a foul shot and a hook but
four baskets by Ciisatclli during this
period brought Utica up and finally-
gave them the victory.

It lookcd like the game was well
by State as they held a three poilit
lcad. 42—31). with twenty-five scc-
onds left but Casatcili scored on a
lay—up and was toulcrl with l‘il'tccn
seconds lclt. llc missed the foul.
Utica lost lhc ball and State took
over; the gamc lookcd ovoi'mliiit it

Just when things start to get go-
ing and every thing seems fine.
something will happen that will
spoil all your plans, or most of them
anyway.

It looked like athletics were com-
ing into their own here at State,
and Coach Hathaway was doing
(and still is.) everything in his pow-
er to keep athletics going in the
right direction. But now there is
one flat tire. This year there will
be NO varsity tennis and NO var-
sity golf. It is a known fact that
one person cannot be two places at
the same time; Coach Hathaway
takes care of the baseball team dur-
ing the spring leaving no coach for
tennis and no coach for golf. Last
year a grad student acted as coach
for these sports but this didn’t
work out too well as several times
the players missed practice and sev-
eral games had to be forfeited. Un-
lcss there is help in the athletic
dcpartment next year. there will be
no tennis and golf then too.

But this should not bother too
many undergrads, because there
never was too much interest in
thcszc sports in the first place.
Proposed Reorganization

As all readers of this column
know, I have bccn proposing the
rcmoval of varsity sports from stud-
cnt association; at the beginning of
this week a meeting between MAA
and WAA was held. and a plan for
the rcorganization of both MAA and
WAA into a separate Athletic or-
ganization was brought up.

State College has been asked to
take part in the Eastern Collegiate
Volleyball Tournament at Spring-
l'icld in April. It the IM Volleyball
loagiics shows enough promise an
All-Star team may be picked to
i'cprcscnt State.
