Extra-Frame Win
Against T. C. C.

State Takes Roll-Oil
With 19 Pin Plurality

Last Thursday the State College
Varsity bowling team evened the
season's activities with Triple Cities
College by defeating the Endicott
squad in a thrilling three game affair
on their home alleys. It was one of
those rare events in which both
teams had identical totals after the
set had been completed. This sittin-
tion required an extra frame to be
bowled, and, in the roll-off, the
Statesmen edged TCC by a total of
nineteen pins. The teachers bowled
over a total of 108 pins in the "ele-
venth" frame against 89 for the
home-town boys.

TCC Takes First Game

The TCC keglers got off to an au-
spicious start by rolling a 828 total
which gave thcln a lead of 34 pins.
In the second game. the statesmen
overcome this deficit and chalked
up a 57 pin advantage to take over
the lead. The Tri-Cities quintet
gave the teachers a scare ill the
third contest, but. when the totals
were summed up, the TCC contin-
gent had matched the 57 pin lead
the Albanians held and the result
was a tie. Mike Lamanna‘s big
double in the ovcrtitne frame was
all the encouragement the States-
inen needed to go on to victory.

Three members of the varsity
squad connected for triples of bet-
ter than 500. Don McDonald. in
chalking up a classy 538, also roll-
ed the high single game of the
evening, a 206. Following close be-
hind was Don Burt with a three
game total of 515 and a 192 single
effort. Bob Reno put together
games of 181, 181. and 146 for a 508;
while Lyle Walsh had a 490. Ritchie
and Duntley paced TCC with 516
and 515 respectively
State Met RP] Last Night

The statesmen resumed activity
in the Intercollegiate League last

week of the campaign and will de-

As the Intro-mural Bowling lea-
gue enters its filial stages, four

tles for third and fourth positions
were waged. One forfeit cut the
playing to four games instead of
the usual five.

The closest game of the afternoon
was the playoff for the third place
position. Psi Gamma and Pierce
bowled their way through an excit-
ing first game, and Psi Gam man-
aged to take the first match by one
pin. The second tilt was a little less
hair-raising, but Psi Gam again
come out on top. this time with a
more comfortable margin. Final to-
tals were 547-546; 581-557.

ern to the bottom of the league,
and kept their own first place posi-
tion as they routed Western with
scort‘s 01' 603-440; 554—493.

The Saylcs team assured them-
scl'. es of the second place berth as
they took two games from Newman.
High scorcr for the afternoon, as
well as for Sayles, was Ann
Braasch, who had totals of 136 and
148.

Chi Sig tied for fourth place with
Pierce as they won both of their
matches from Kappa Delta. The to-
tals were 562-527; 540-519. The fifth
game resulted in two victories for

Junior Varsity
Nipped By ABC

For the second time in one week
a last minute basket meant defeat
for State’s J.V. On Wednesday,
March 1, Utica beat State in the
last few seconds and Monday, ABC
nipped the junior “Peds” by the
count of 55-54. This was the last
game of the year for State's J.V.

It was a close game all the way;
State had a slight half time lead,
27-26. The game started off with
Owens scoring two foul shots and
then ringing in two baskets to put
State out in front 6-0. The lead was
increased to 11-4 before ABC start-
ed cutting it down. Newt Owens was
the main reason State was in the
ball game; not only did he score 24
points, twelve in each half, but he
gave the team just about the only
fight they had. His foul shooting
was almost perfect, 10 for 11.
Adinolfi's Shots Decisive

Hmvever. it was Adinolfi’s 12
points in the second half, that
brought victory to ABC. He scored
repeatedly on one-handed push
shots as he drove in through State's
weak zone. The game was marked
by fouls. a total of 49 were called,
which put four players out of the
game.

Saturday saw a powerful Union
J.V. take State's J.V. by the count
01 78-56. Union had command of
the game right from the start and
opened up a 38-21 half time score,
It was Batkiewicz's twelve poionts
in this half that put the Victor’s
out in front from where they coast-
ed to an easy victory. The second
half was almost a carbon copy as
Union never was below a fourteen
point lead. Batkiewicz led both
teams in scoring with 18; Bisson
was close behind with 17. Owens
netted 13.

Score Second Win Over ’I‘CC

Last Thursday the J.V.’s bent
TCC's J.V. for the second time this
year, this time by 14 points, 59-45.
McGory. Golden, and Owens led the
attack as they chipped in 19, 14.
and 13 points.

This year the J.V. record was six
wins and ten losses. Two of the
losses were by one point. The high
scorer for the J.V.‘s this year was
Art Golden with 170 points in 16
games. Newt Owens was close be-
hind with 161 points in 16 games.
From the foul line Art Wiegand's
33 of 51 was tops, a .647 average,
Owens came in second with 36 out
of 58. a .621 average.
