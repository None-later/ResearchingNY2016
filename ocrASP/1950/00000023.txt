VDZ To Win
'8’ League Title

Los Locos walloped a mall-power-
less VanDelzee team Wednesday to
gain the undisputed championship
o.r the “B” League in the MAA Ill-
tramural Basketball playoff.

The Locos led all the way in run-
ning up a lop-sided 56—26 victory.
They were in very little trouble at
any time. although the score wasn’t
opened up ulltll the second half.
Neil Ryder paced the winners ill the
first half with eight of his 14
points as they rolled up all 8 point
bulge, 20-12. Len Davis of the losers
matched his 8 points, and Fran
Streeter's work off the back boards
kept VallDerzee ill the game.

You Dcrzcc Folds in 2nd Half

A few minutes after the start of
the second half big Streeter fell and
injured his trick knee, and that
just about killed the already waning
VollDel'zce cause. The teamwork of
Len Davis and George Lcin kept
the losers from folding completely.
but since VDZ played without a
number of regular starters. they
wcre a weak match for the fllll
strength Los Locos.

Giordano Scores 16 Points

Peter Giordano was the big gun
for the Locos. as he hit for 12
points ill the second hall to total
16 for the game. Ed Cummings hit
for 9 points from outside to hoop
his high total for the year.

The second half turned illto a
rent us llle winners had all file time
they wanted to take their Shots.
They hit on a high percentage, and
run away wifll the game as it turn-
cd illto a sloppy football-like coll-
tesl near the elld.

Locos to Face Potter

Arrangements are being made for
11 final 1M i:lllllllpi0ll:;llip playoff
between Potter Club and Los Locos.
If possible, it will be played on the
same night as the rivalry basketball

Last Friday night the Peds jour-
neyed to Plattsburgh to play the
final game of the 1949-50 season.
State lost to Plattsburgh State
Teachers by the score of 67 to 61.

The margin of victory does not
tell the true story of the game. The
Peds entered the half time on the
wrong end of a 33 to 20 score. At
the end of the third quarter the
scoreboard read Plattsburgh 59 and
Visitors 34. The boys from State
caught all in the last quarter and
rang up 27 points while their oppo—
llellts were netting 9.

As ill many previous games, inac-
curacy from the foul lille cost the
Peds the game. A total of 17 fouls
were missed by the Peds. If the
boys from State had been able to
convert 8 of the 17 charity shots
llle decision might have been re—
versed. "

Tile big guns for State were
Brown. Warden. and Marzcllo who
hooped 15, 14. and 12 polllts respec-
tirely. Bob Garrow paced the Platts-
burgh attack by ripping tile cords
for 20 points. He was ably assisted
by teammates Spellmall. Baldassari.
and Stornsky who contributed 12, 10,
and 9 points respectively.

Bob Hausner led the last quarter
attack with 7 poillts. Tile Peds drew
within three poillts of the boys from
Plaltsburgh in the waning moments
of the game only to have Stornsky
sink a quick one to widen the mar-
gin to 5. Garrow got a free throw
and lnade it good. This was the way
the game stood at the filial buzzer.
