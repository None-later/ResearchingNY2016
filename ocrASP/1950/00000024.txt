Following discussion, a vote was
taken on the handbook motion. The
motion was passed and 1200 hand-
books of the soft—covered staple
variety will be printed this year.

The Sophomore Class gained two
rivalry points by winning the de-
bate and proving "that Eskliiios
should be furnished with fur-lined
bathtubs."

Last Saturday evening’s perform-
ance of “Patience” convinced this
Gilbert and Sullivan devotee that
even comic opera can be overdone.
The colorful, tuneful. and continu-
ous burlesque of these well—liked
operettas on this occasion seemed
to get out of hand. Perhaps such a
reaction on the part of the cast is
typical of a second-night perform-
ance, and after much rehearsal.
and the enthusiastic press l‘( ceptton
of the previous performance, the
cast deserved to really enjoy the
final product of its effort.

A distinctly negative feature of
the production was the stage set—a
gaudy and dizzily regular forest fre-
quented by pastel—and orange-clad-
maidens. The arrival of the trim
and. I happily admit. extremely
dashing dragoons, while it added to
the hodge-podge of color. was def—
initely a relief. The costumes of the
female leads were attractive enough
and the poets’ berets and velvet
knee-breeches were the unfortun-
ately prescribed attire.

Praises Duets

Musically the selections in the
second act seemed somewhat su-
perior. The duets were well done
throughout the performance. es-
pecially those of the Misses Thorpe
and Whitcral’t in “Long Years Ago.’
and the Thorpe and Bennett "Pri-
thee, Pretty Maidens." Joe Crucil—
la's happy combination of vocal and
histronic ability was not up to par
in this performance. I felt. but one
or two perfectly thunderous notes
assured us that his powerful mice
was necessarily checked to balance
and blend with the less robust
voices of the other principals. The
limited range required by the title
role was a disappointment, but Miss
Thorpe‘s arias were charmingly
sung. Both Miss Cassler and Joan
Whltcral't have good volume and
vocal assurance. Miss Casslcr's voice.
while not true in pitch at times.
with sufficient accompaniment can
be used to fine advantage. as it was
in "Silvercd the Raven Hair."

Webster. Bennett Pleasing

The usual Gilbert and Sullivan
tongue-twister was capably handled
by “Colonel” Webster, and “Poet”
Bennett's rendition of "A Magnet
Hung in a Hardware Shop" pleased
the audience as well as the adoring
maidens. Betty Hendrle's voice was
pleasing but too light to be effec—
tive in ensemble, while Louise Pet—
iieltl showed promise for better roles
in future productions. The maidens
and dragoons sacrificed accuracy for
enthusiasm at times, and the or-
chestra performed commendany
with the possible exception of the

too-loud first act finale.

As actors and actresses the prin-
cipals were generally satisfactory.
However, Bunthorne's antics and
grimaces. which were certainly hila-
rious for the first ten minutes, lost
some of their effectiveness with
each repeated gesture. Miss Thorpe
very convincingly effected the
dairymaid’s complete naivete. sim-
ple rapture and sincere dismay
which the circumstances were sup-
posed to render satirically comic.
Lady Jane was by turns determin-
edly brazen and disarmingly blunt.
Ray Kelly’s “dead pan" portrayal of
the Duke was quite adequate. and
the trio of reformed, lily-toting
dragoons. although they looked
quite tortured and desperate, per-
severed admlrably in the broadest
jibe at aestheticism the Operetta af-
fords. Smith, the non-vocal solic-
itor. was excellently cast.

The views here expressed lead
this writer to conclude that the
college opera workshop would do
well next year to explore other light
opera literature. and give the be-
loved Messrs. Gilbert and Sullivan
a rest.
