ter sent to Dean Thomas Pollack
the Inter-Fraternity Council an-
nounced the removal of discrimin-
atory clauses and indicated that
membership would be denied to any
Greek letter society, whether local
or national, which failed to com-
ply with the resolution.

With the elimination of these
clauses by Washington Square Col-
lege of NYU it joins the growing
list of educational institutions
which have taken action against
frat bias. Within the past few
months, Columbia, Amherst, and
the University of Connecticut have
passed similar resolutions. At Wis-
consin, Temple, Rutgers, Syracuse,
Michigan and Dartmouth, the var-
ious student governing bodies also
have indicated their opposition to
discriminatory clauses in constitu-
tions.

Colgate University’s paper fea-
tured an editorial in which it was
stated that the freshmen wen
showing concern over bigotry ii.
the Fraternities and that the time
had come to take a positive stand
on this matter. Last year the Col-
gate IFC passed a resolution in
favor of seeing discriminatory
clauses abolished in fraternities
which have Colgate chapters. The
houses also wrote to their nation-
als about the matter. Since this
token gesture, the Council hasn't
even met to discuss the issue. The
need for action was pointed out.

By 801'" SPORTS STAFF

 

Rivalry began with a. dull start
for the Busy Bees of ’52 during the
1948-49 season.

The first defeat for the DafIles
was witnessed when the class of ’51
took our measure by a 13 to 3 count
in Rivalry pushbail. We were behind
in the first period of the game by
a score of 10-3. The Sophs. then
frosh, gained these three points
when at half time the ball was in
’51’s territory. The situation was re-
versed at the end of the game. when
at the filial whistle the ball was in
our territory rounding out the score
13—3.

Our next venture in the way of
Rivalry sports was girls field hockey
which was played on a very muddy
ﬁeld. Both teams were held scoreless
for the ﬁrst half. then the Green
Gremlins broke through our defense
and scored three quick goals to de—
cide the game.

Hard-working Pat Dai'gusch. Evie
Kamke. Mary Borys. and Rosalind
Loucks made up most of the varsity
cheerleading squad while Ann Reed.
captain, Betty Adams. Shirley Coop-
er. Jeanne Hamilton, Aime Koles-
ens. and Joyce Shafcr represented
our class on the JV team.

Brown Makes Varsity

Bob Brown was our lone freshman
representative in the Fed‘s 1948—49
lincup. Joe Dolan. Bob Hausner and
Dave Wander upheld our class on
the JV basketball team.

Our next Rivalry event was foot-
ball. Once again wc went down to
defeat to thc tune of a 14-0 score.
This game was played on a very
mude field. which hampered the
attack of bolli teams.

'.i’e fuired better in Rivalry swim-
i'ning. Ann Murphy won the Old
Clothes event and teamed up with
Mary Borys to lake the backstroke
relay. Tom King tied Ed White in
the men‘s freestyle event. but was
defeated by Ed in the run—off by a
narrow margin. Ted Pccne won the
backstroke for the fresh and Georgi-
Voltz. Don Sonbcrg. Ken Orncr. and
Tom King combined to win the re—
lay for us. Despite these two wins
the mcu were defeated. 3 events toZ.

Follor‘ing up the girl’s rivalry
basketbrll game the Sophomore
boys were out to make a clean
sweep of the night but failed and
went down in defeat at the hands
of the freshmen by a score of 33-
28.

The game was a very sloppy one
which featured very bad ball hand-
ling by both teams who were even
poorer in their shooting percentage
from file field.

’l‘clfcr Leads Frosh to Win

For the Red Devils it was Pete
Teller, Herb Egert and Pete Gior-
dano who spelled the difference.
These three did most of the Frosh
scoring and rebounding. although
Pat Carlo did more than his share
of rebounding also. Although the
Devils were essentially a smaller
team. they appeared to have more
scrap and this paid off. Pete Tel-
l‘cr, who displayed some fancy ball-
handling. acted as 53‘s field general.

Dick Wander and Neil Ryder
paced the yellow-clad Sophomores.
Between them they hooped 20 of
the 28 points that the Bees were
able to garner. Inability of the
Sophs to hit from the field was
the main reason for their down-
fall.

The Bees did not move the bail
fast enough against the light. zone
which the freshmen set up, and
as a result. did not heave enough
shots at the hoop.

All in all, the grime was an ex-
citing one to watch. The score was
knollcd 14-14 at half time. and
with two minutes remaining the
Sophs trailed by only t\vo points.

The Frosh hue-up was as follows:

Two Games

Four games were played off this
week in the Intramural Bowling
League, as the league nears its fi-
nal stages of play. The race for
top honors is still on. However. it
certainly looks as if Gamma Kap,
last year's chumps, is the team
which might walk off as the victors
again this year.

Psi Gamma took two games from
Sayles this week and as a result
tightens the gap between the sec-
ond and third place position. High
for Psi Gam was Terry Hayes who
had totals of 145 and 149. Ann
Brasch hit 136 for Sayles. The final
totals for both games were 554-
485, and 635—579.

Gamma Kap won easy victories
over Phi Delt as Ethyl Heath and
Edie Kelleher bowled games of 174
and 162 respectively. These victor-
ies enable Gamma Kap to retain
their previous position. Marge Far~
well was high for Phi Delt with a
136 total. The scores for the match
were 652-523. aria 642-540.

Newman pulled into the fifth po-
silioii and pushed Kappa Delta into
last place by trouncing them with
scores of 621-549, uni. 625-528. Top
scoring honor!- went to Herbie
Skidmore of KD and Joan Peter-
son of Newman mth totals of 159
and 151 respectively.

BZ and Western split t. rir
matches. BZ look the first t.lt.
561-493, and Western took the sec-
ond. 531-516. Chi Sig failed to play
their match with Pierce. This was
the only forfeit of the afternoon.

Begins Training

0 To Gamma Kop For Early Season

Eicl-i And Clearwaier
Only Veteran Pitchers

Coach Merlin Hathaway issued his
call for candidates last Tuesday.
The men who are going out for
battery positions were to report in
the gym on Tuesday and the re-
mainder of the candidates are to
turn out this Monday.

State's team will be greatly weak-
ened this year as a result of the
loss of their first string battery,
Amiow and SteVenson. Jack Marks,
veteran first sacker, and Colpoys,
slugging center fielder. have also
left the team; Marks signed a base-
ball contract with the New York
Giants and Coipoys transferred to
another college.

Nine pitchers and three catchers
answered Hathaway's call for battery
tryouts. Among these tryouts were
veterans Bob Eich, and Harvey
Clearwarter. Elch won two and lost
two last season while Clearwater
Journeyecl to the hill four times and
came away with one victory and
lhree defeats. Eich, a stocky right
hunder. and Cleai‘water. another
right hander. will probably share
the bulk of the mound duties for
the Feds this year.

Among the other candidates for
hurling duties for this year are Ry-
der. Zeubens, Phoeper. Egert, Pein.
Clark. and Acecic. Zeubens has
pitched for three years for New~
burgh High. Egert, another righty.
hurled two years for Westhampton
Beach High. Ryder and Pheoper
pilched Junior varsity ball for Al-
bany High and Roesselville High re-
spectively. Clark and Pein are two
other pitching hopefuls who turned
out for practice. Clark hails from
Binghainton and Pein is :1 veteran.
Acecio. another mound hopeful. was
the only left hander to turn out for
practice. He pitched in both the K1-
wanis and American Legion League.
'l‘lircc Try Out For Catcher

Adamason, McConnvllle. and Tay-
lor are trying out for the catching
position. Adamson, 170 pound fresh-
man. comes from Troy. He caught
three years for Troy High and also
played some ball in the service. He
has done some catching in a night
biiscbiill league since he came back

from the service. McConiiville
graduated from Mount Pleasant
High and has had no previous
catching experience. Bill Taylor

comes from Macedon and has had
lour years experience as an out-
fielder and catcher. .
