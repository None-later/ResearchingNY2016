One For The Money. . .

A week before vacation, three members of Student
Association made a report on a conference. In our
yearly budget, we appropriate a substantial sum
for conferences. Yet, the body of the assembly
was not outstanding for its interest and attention
to the speakers.

How important are conferences? We send peo-
ple regularly, more or less taking for granted that
the expense is justified.

Three things enter into the value of a confer-
ence. One is the actual conference, its planning, ap-
propriateness, and location. Second is the person-
ality of the person who is sent. His tactfulness,
friendliness and couscientiousness mean the dif-
ference between a valuable conference, and one
which is just "for fun.” We are familiar with the
type of conference goer who attends for the thrill
of traveling, of getting to the city, of partying,
and who shows up for only one or two meetings.
The third thing of importance is what Student As—
sociation expects of the people. it sends to con—
ferences. We slum/(l expect some sort of a detailed
report on every conference, including those at-
tended by members of separate organizations as
well as those attended by delegates from Student
Association directly. A delegate who knows he will
be expected to report in a l‘iusiness—like way is
apt to get more out of the meetings he attends.
And, if reports are properly organized and pre-
sented, the members of the individual organiza-
tions, and the assembly. can benefit by the infor-
mation brought back to them. Since everyone
cannot, and should not go, the next best thing is
to hear about it.

To hear about it is only valuable, however, when
the conference is valuable to those who attend. is
there ever a conference that is really valuable to
SA and to the delegates? Does attending a series
of meetings and discussions in some field really
contribute anything worthwhile for the money
spent?

The answer cannot be “yes” for every confer-
ence. Whenever any one of the three important
constituents is missing, the answer is "no." ifrom
a successful conference, some of these values should
result: (l) additional technical knowledge, (2)
possible improvements for a particular group or
phase in our college life. (.3) comparisons indicat—
ing our progress, or lack of if, and that of other
schools, (4) publicity for our school and for par-
ticular phases of our development as a teachers
College, (5) friends and contacts for State on many
campuses, (0) a loss of short-sightedness about our
own and other schools, (7) new ideas, in all areas.

Perhaps a written, published report would be as
effective as an oral report. How about a compiled
conference report. issued yearly? Let’s not forget,
however, that most people remember best an inter
esting, well—planned, and report. llon't groan. l’u-
turi: teachers should be practicing at making what
they present orally so interesting that people have
to listen.

 

Conferences can be valuable. We should check
every conference, so it will be Worthwhile to the
most number of people. We should get our money’s
worth.

Tears mist my old eyes. The cam-
pus has changed little since 1951. I
wipe the tears away with a tail of
my battered Prince Albert and totter
on, anticipating more important
changes on the inside. As you all
know, Pragery tthc cult of practi-

Icality) has triumphed.

Since my undergraduate days, the
College has become one of the out-
standing centers for the revolution-
ary doctrines of Matt Pragg. an un—
successful nursery school teacher
from South Gook. New York. A com-
plete program has been instituted
here founded on his principles of
education. This is in keeping with
the federal statute that compels
American school teachers to follow
the new philosophy. All classes are
now taught by indoctrinated pro-
fessors fresh from Urp, the West
Point of education.

One thing which impresses me as
the epitome of practicality is the
complete freedom enjoyed by the
pigeons among the nooks and cran-
nies around the old buildings. All
protective screening has been re-
moved and perches built where foot—
ing had been rather hazardous. An
interesting side-light to this pas-
toral scene is the little old umbrella
man standing at a safe distance
from Draper Hall. He reminds me so
much of someone I once knew!

In the corridor, I was a. bit shock—
ed to find that Minerva has been
turned into a hat-rack for the con-
venience of those students who nev-
er seem to make their 8110's. The
Co—ordinator of Student Activities.
formerly Dean, sprang up from his
easy chair under the stairway to
greet me. Upon hearing my request
to visit the classes he smiled broad-
ly. scratched a cauliflower ear with
his cigar stub. and said impressively,
“Who cares?”

Still puzzling over our provocative
conversation. I wandered into a
biology lab. a thing I had scrupu-
lously avoided in my student years.
I glimpsed in innocently—«and back-
ed out blushing to the roots of my
hair!

I had already learned that edu—
cation courses have been eliminated
as impractical, unnecessary. and in-
imieal to the new credo.

In the English classes. instructors
were demonstrating the use of an-

 

thologies as doorstops, window props,
and fuel for small fires. Goodness,
what next!

Luckily my itinerary is interrupted
by the cries of “Spy! Traitor!" and
a general rush of maddened adoles—
cents in my direction. Looking about
to see who the culprit is, I observe
with terror my Phi Beta Kappa key
glittering on my watch chain.

After a good restful vacation, this
week seems like a good opportunity
to give you a round-up of the radio
activities on the campus this year.
On the Wednesday evening before
vacation, Caroline Williams and
George Kline presented the ﬁnal
program in the “Capital Campus"
series on station WROW. This series
of programs did a ﬁne job in pre-
senting interesting and digniﬁed
publicity for State College. During
the course of the year. such topics
as the Religious Clubs, the various
departments. Student Government.
and current topics such as Brother-
hood Week were covered on the air.

The program is being discontinued
because of complications arising as
a result of broadcasting baseball
games. The radio station. following
its policy of broadcasting the games,
has certain commercial commit-
ments which must be kept before
any public service time can be al-
lowed. Since a regularly assured
time could not be granted. it was
deemed best to discontinue for this
year. However. we‘ll be looking for-
ward to hearing “Capital Campus"
again in the fall.

Radio activities of this year. in-
cluding “Capital Campus" and the
Clinton Square Neighborhood House
program tWOKO—Wednesday at
4:35 pm.) have been the outlets for
the work of many people. Twenty-
four people worked on the script-
writing aspect. and forty—five stu—
dents actually gave radio perform-
ances. Incidentally .the number for-
ty-ﬁve does not include such persons
as three Milne students, a. dozen
Neighborhood House children. and
Dr, Collins, who also appeared.

 

C’me

To The Editor:

To the many people who signed
up for the coaches to New York,
Rochester. and Syracuse:

This is a statement in which I
hope to explain why the coaches
failed to run this Easter time.

As you probably know there were
about thirty fellows and girls who
had signed up on the list posted in
lower Draper Hall. Well this list
was taken off the bulletin board
and so were two others. I went from
dorm to dorm and tried to contact
all these people. but I was unable
to do so.

It seems that a very influential
person among us had taken it upon
himself to thwart every attempt I
made. I was refused permission to
make an announcement in assembly
on the grounds that my notice did
not concern the student body as a
whole. but the train announcements
were made. It seems that this same
person was behind the scenes for
the train arrangements. I was asked
for an article for the school paper.
This article never was published but
an article was written up about the
train trip .1 had put up innumerable
signs and posters and these were
taken down, mutilated, or covered
up by train notices.

I went and spoke. to Dean Stokes
and Dean Nelson. and with the ad-
vice of President Collins they sug-
gested that i go before Myskania. I
did just that, but very little eotild
be accomplished because this same
influential person is a member of
that august body.

What could I do? There are three
ways of contacting the student body:
assemblwa was forbidden to make
my announcement; the Duper—willy
article never appeared; not!ces«
they were taken down or covered
up by train notices. I was helpless
and you students were not allowed
to make the choice between going
home by train or chartered coach.

You were forced to do what a small
clique wanted you to do. It that
democracy? I don‘t think so, and
neither do the many people who
know these facts. In the words of
Dr. Nelson: This is unfair compe-
tition and something which the stu-
dents should not tolerate. (no quote)

There is nothing which can be
done in this particular case any-
more but we can see. that it never
happens again. We can see that no
more D&A posters. no more Music
Council posters, or any other notices
ever again are mutilated or destroy-
ed. That is not too much to ask
because other colleges .ioni have
our problem. Let's make a "lionge
now!

As for eliinin:.iting a repttition of
our current singular adrninlstrntim
in which a student's voice can be
easily squelched. remember that
elections are coming up this spring.
Remember that you don't want of-
ficers because they are “pretty boys"
or "personality kids," or because
they can put on a good show in front.
of assembly, you want representa-
tives who will light for your rights
and express your sentiments. Our
government will only be as good as

To The. Editor :

bulletin boards. in doing so. I have
come across a very bad situation.
From time to thin ' "we received

The Comnto’ii-Stater is given the widest latitude as
author of this column, although his viewpoints do
not nceessdrilj/ reflect those of the STATE Coccaoa
News.

 

It's back to the old grind again after 12 g-rand
and g-lorious days of catin'. sleepin’, and lazln'. Now
everyone's counting days again—21 days to M.U.D.,
35 more school days till final exams and even Jerry
Dunn and. Shirley Wiltsc are counting their ’71 days
until “I do“ day.

I}. V. DAYS . ..

At the last S. C. meeting Before Vacation. during two
hours of discussing the new reinforced Election Com-
mission Constitution. the age old problem of Mys-
kania arose. There was a suggestion to transfer all
election activities including the counting of ballots
to the Election Commission. which then would have
to be increased in size. There are still those who feel
Myskania should be no longer judicial but strictly hon-
orary, and who might still bring such action to the
floor of the Association.

Council's review of budgets began with a careful
scrutiny of all lines. If the Association is as cautious
we can look to long drawn out Budget Assemblies.

Keep your eyes on those key lilies. After Mlini Gor-
skie’s article on outward recognitions. there ought to
be some discussion toward abolishment of these lines
as there was last year. Incidentally. what happened
to the suggestions for a single SA key for all ac-
tivities?

FROSII FLASH . . .

The writers of this column have been informed that
the Soph substitutes in the last issue unfairly ac-
cused the frosh of sheepishly hiding their Boat to
Paltimar under stairs. The communique received states
that this was graciously done in order not to inter-
fere with Soph publicity.

.A reputedly greater Frosh Show is being awaited
after the excellent production by the Sophs.

WE'D LIKE TO KNOW . . .

. why there was no S.C. meeting last Wednes-
day even though Tony could not attend? With M.U.D.
and the end of the school year staring us in the face.
and most of the budget to be reviewed by this group,
why is it not conducted by the V.P.? We are espe-
cially curious since the Council had been urged to
attend for quorum's sake and for the urgency of the
business.

This trotting time has already thrown nominations
for officers in our laps today and it means we‘ll have
to take. a quick look around for good prospects for
officers. We hope that the slates will be filled by more
than just the number to be elected. Classes will be
following suit with undoubtedly more interest than
has been shown all year.

TIIE COMING SIDE OI“ THE NEWS . . .
The Commuters‘ Club has revived tradition with

terrific plans for a MUD formal (lance. which will be
going on in the Gym. Commons, and Lounge~and it
Will be inexpensive too.

This weekend Potter and Phi Delt will start the
spring formal parade . . . the fresh will be putting
on the feedbag at Herbert's.

Even State will partake in
Tulip Festival this May.

RUMOR DEPT.

Two nasties are passing through these portals. One
is that the new Dorm will not be ready in Septem-
ber (there‘s always Washington Park! and the other,
to the sorrow of prospective practice LitIClICl‘S. that
Milne will start two weeks before college in Sep-
tember.

the Annual Albany

Any and all information to the contrary will be.
welcome.

A GOOD EXPERIMENT . . .

. . was conducted on March 31 by Tony Pro with
his “For the Good of the Order“ discussion. Brought.
out some good quizzes and good retorts. Shows that
some are thinking and are willing to defend their
thoughts publicly. Too bad this started so late, but
the start was definitely good—unight be used more
effectively by next year's President. We're all for
having more such discussions.

LAST WORDS . . .

Our "Purliainentarian" Jim Brophy is now legislat-
ing at Van Derzee.

Let's remember Tony‘s request. to not tcar down
notices or decorations from the corridors.

How do you like those spiffy new drinking fountains?

Potter Edges Locos,-
Win Basketball Title

Potter t‘lub came from behind in
the last three minutes of the final
quarter to nip Los Locos by one
point in the Intramural Basketball
Championship play-off. The game.
played on March 24, was close all
the way, with the surprising Locos
ketping the le.id during most of the
game.

The final score was 30-29.

Using a zone defense for three
quarters. the Potiermen were inef-
fective on defense. as well as poor
off the backboards. Finally. realizing
that the zone proved no riddle to
the "B" league champions. Potter
switched to man—to-man in the last.
quarter and pulled ahead.

At no time in the game was either
team more than three points ahead.
Los Locos outplayed the Potter team
for most. of the game, but. the indivi-
dual brilliance of each of the Potter
players finally enabled the Clubbers
to eke. out the win and the chain-
pionship.

Loss To Potter

The Youngsters. despite a loss to
Potter Club just before the spring
vacation, are still perched atop the
volleyball “A” league. The Young-
sters are two games up in the win-
ning column. Potter Club, KB, and
SLS are tied for second place with
each of them supporting a 2 and 1
record.

In the “B” league, the Angels and
EEP's both have unblemished rec-
ords; 3 and 0 for the Angels, 2 and 0
for the EEP’s. The Mudhens with
a 4 and 1 record now have to just
sit back and hope that some of the
other teams will knock off these un-
defeated teams although they have
a chance at the EEP’s themselves in
their filial game of the season. This
game should be one of the most ex-
citing 0f the current season.

The outstanding players on the
league—leading teams seem to be Joe
Biviano an.l Jim Warden of the
Youngsters and Bob Brown and Bob

Life Saving Course
Offered To Students

This "I‘uesday a course in senior
life-saving will begin at the Hack-
et Junior High School pool. These
courses, which are being sponsored
by the American Red Cross, are
open to both men and Women. A
jun.or life—saving certificate is not
a prerequisite for the course, nor
are there any other specific require—
ments. The first. few flights of the
course are devoted to refreshing the
candidates in the basic strokes, and
testing their ability in distance.
When this proceedure has been
completed. the actual life-saving in-
structions will begin.

Blanks which should be filled out
for the course may be obtained in
Mr. Gibson's office. Also, if any-
one already holds an instructor's
certificate. and would be interested
in teaching the course, it is pos-
sible. for them to do so as instruc—
tors are needed.

Other courses which are being
offered by the Red Cross are Junior
life—saving courses, an instructor re—
fresher course. and an Adult begin-
ner course. Any additional informa-
tion which may be desired can be
obtained from either Mr. Gibson or
Elly Adams.

Play-offs for top honors in WAA
basketball commenced just before
vacation. A total of five games play-

made.

On March 27, Myskania faced
Pierce and won in a Close game, 13-
12. Audrey Koch scored 11 of the 13
points for Myskania. and Dec Web-
ber came through with the remain-

Myskania again took the floor
that night in a clash with BZ. For
the second time, Myskania won. 25-

has led Myskania in almost every
game. came through with another
lead. For the second time of the
night, Mary Borys was high scorer
for Beta Zeta.

Pierce gained a 24—12 win from
Phi Dell. its first and only win since
the play—offs began. Phi Delta lost.

Myskania Triumphs

On March 28, Myskania won its
third and final game from Phi Del-
la. The Myskania girls dealt a 36—7
blow in a game where Phi Delt was
unable to score effectively against
their fast. moving opponents. This
victory definitely placed the favored
Myskania in top position. and the

Harris. Babe Paterson, and Joan
-laggerty did a fine job of schedul-
ing the games and seeing them
through. The many hours they do-
voted at the games were certainly
well spent. Congratulations are also
in order for the refs who tooted the
whistle through a tough season.
Here‘s to next year. hoping it shall
be as good as this season.

The speck!”

Linc Wing Again

Several weeks ago Hollywod gave
to their best actors Oscars, for high
achievement. The next day State
gave an Oscar too, also for high
achievement. However, State’s recip-
ient wasn’t an actor. Linc will
be remembered here at State for

 

his four years of basketball
and baseball playing; he will
also be remembered by those

who knew him well, as indeed “the
most unforgctable character I have
ever met.” Line's Oscar wasn’t any
statue but a simple pen, yet how
fitting it was—as coach Hathaway
said Linc will now be able to write
down the beginning of a great ca-
reer. This reporter joins the rest
of the college in wishing Linc all
the best of everything . . .
Efficiency Plus ! ! !

Last night there was a joint meet-
ing of MAA and WAA; this was the
second of a series of meetings in
which both organizations plan to
combine into one athletic associa-
tion for economy and efficiency.
Plans seem to be going along
smoothly and a full report along
with a new constitution will be pre-
sented to student council before
long. First step in the right direc-
tion. It is about time the students
here start reorganizing in order to
meet the needs of the college. The
present MAA and WAA systems
were set up NOT to meet the needs
of 1500 students . . .

At Last . . .

It has been heard from the grape-
vine that the State has provided
funds for a new position on the
college facultywan assistant coach
to help the overburdened Coach
Hathaway. Help is on the way . . .
Spring is Here

The intramural softball season
starts Monday—hope to see every-
one at the games; last year there
were. some spirited crowds at most
games. The Beavers won the crown
then—most of them will now be
playing for Potter. Games will be

0 on Saturdays as well as weekdays.

Seems as though the girls are hav-
ing trouble in finding somewhere to
hold their games—dorm field is out.
Your Support is Needed

The college baseball season starts
a week from tomorrow at Triple

Cities. The first home game will
be the following Monday against
ABC . . . hope this year the State

students will go to some of the home
uiines . . . last year there were more
players than fans . . . Is Bleecker
Stadium that far away? While on
the subject of baseball I go on rec-
old as picking the Yanks and Bums
to repeat all the way . . . and the
Rangers to come from behind to
win the Stanley Cup . . .
