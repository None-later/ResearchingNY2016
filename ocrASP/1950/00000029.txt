Mathews Dichsses Placements,

By NORINE CARGILL

Since most State Seniors are con-
cerned now with future employment,
information was obtained from Mr.
Mathews of the Teacher Placement
Bureau concerning the trend in em-
ploying teachers.

Most principals prefer fifth
year students to Seniors. However,
one or two principals have specified
their desire for fourth year students.
Probably State’s reputation for ver-
satility accounts for some of the re-
quests in fields which we do not

train teachers. There has even been
a request for a Home Economics
teacher.

Most of State’s Seniors head for
the wide open spaces. This is shown
by the fact that out of the 56 stu-
dents obtaining jobs to date this
year only four are designated for
big cities.

Mr. MatheWS stated that in a bul-
letin put out by the Veteran’s Ad-
ministration the outlook for high
school teaching jobs for 1950-51
was predicted. Fewer teachers are
needed in High Schools due to a de-
crease in enrollment. Another im-
portant factor is the tenure policy of
High Schools which makes estab-
lished teachers reluctant to leave
their jobs. The best field for em-
ployment is Library since the per-
centage of openings is much greater
than the students available.

Mr. Mathews also stressed the
necessity of students taking jobs
where they can find them. It is no
longer possible to pick the exact
salary or location that is desired by
the student.
