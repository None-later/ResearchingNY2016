Spring Schedule Fails To Win

Opens Season
At Triple Cities

The State Peds will open the 1950
baseball season in Binghamton on
Saturday, when they meet the Triple
Cities College nine. State will field
a veteran team with Eich. Clear-
water. and Lein slated to share the
hurling duties.

Old Mother Nature may have tak-
en a hand in the Feds' hope for a
victory by keeping the boys indoors
for most of the spring practice ses—
sion. The Feds went outside for the
first time on Monday. Coach Hath-
away is afraid that this lack of
practice will hamper not only his
mound staff but also the other mem-
bers of the team.

The team has been greatly
strengthened this year by the return
of ten lettermen from last year’s
squad. Coach Hathaway is having a
very difficult time choosing- his
squad because he has seen them
in action only a short time.
He has therefore decided to post-
pone cutting the squad until sonic-
time next week.

Hold 3-5-1 Record

Last season the Feds compiled a
l‘ECOI'(i of 3 wins, 5 losses. and 1 tie.
State defeated ABC twice and Uticu
once. They also tied Ulica on the
home field. The boys lost twice to
Norlh Adams and Union. They were
defeated once by l‘lattsburgh Slate
and the other game. wi'“ Plattsburgh
yas rained out.

The Feds have a thirteen gilll'.‘
schedule this year. The volt-inns
who are trying out for this year‘s
team are Ken Rutlcy. Linc Marzcllo.
Don McDonald, Paul Carter. Harvey
Clearwater. John Duflus. Bob Eich.
Bill Engelhart. Al Kaehn. and
George Lein.

Last year Bob Elch hurch two
wins and two losses for the Feds.
Harvey Clcarwatcr worked in four
games and won one. Lein come up
with a sore arm in the beginning of
last season and didn‘t participate
in any games. The catching duties
will be taken over by Doug Adamson
and Paul McConville.

The Feds will open the home sea-
son at Blocker stadium on Friday.
April 28, when they meet ABC.

Power plus was exhibited Monday
as the Intramural softball season
opened with a 15-12 triumph over
SLS by KDR. However. things
changed on the next day as Carmen
Corsi. pitching for the Pirates, show-
ed excellent control; he struck out
eight and allowed only three hits.
but two of these were costly.

With each team blasting out 14
hits the pitchers had a nightmare
in the Monday opener. John Hop-
kins went the distance for SLS and
was belted hard; his team commit-
ted eight errors behind him, which
didn't help either. Brophy and Haus-
ner led the attack with three hits
apiece. Brophy getting two doubles
and a triple.

Bon Wins Game

Bon. who received credit for the
win. and Smith did the hurling for
the. winners. neither of whom was
too effective against the SL8 bat-
ters. Marsiglio belted out a
pair of singles and doubles. and
scored three runs himself. SLS
started things popping in the ﬁrst
as they hit Bon for four hits and
three runs. However, Brophy's dou-
ble with two on after J. Dunn had
scored. tied the game up and when
he scored later on two long flies
KDR wcnl. out in front to stay. SLS
came back with ﬁve runs in the
last. two innings but it wasn't
enough.

Golden‘s single in the ﬁfth inn-
ing was the ﬁrst ball hit out of the
infield by the Bisceps who were be-
ing mowed down by the pitching of
Corsi. When Tabor doubled a mo-
ment later. for the last hit off Cor-
si. in clear the bases after Jacobson
had walked and Jacoby was hit by
a pitched ball. the Bisecps had three
runs. However. it was a booted ball
in the last half of the seventh on
Brown‘s sinking drive to center that
cleared the bases for the ball game;
Brown scored the winnng run as
the throw home wcnt wild
Pirates Score Early

The Pirates scored their ﬁrst run
in the second on successive triplr-s
by Parisc and Gori': they bunchcl
lhrec walks. an error. and two hits
for four runs in the third and pick-
ed up nnoihcr in the last inning
bul blow lhc game in the last half
of the seventh. Jacobson got credit
for the win. relieving Brown in the
fourlh.

New 5414’ Constitution

By PAT JAI

State College is expanding! A new
dorm, a new commerce building, and
more students are helping to make
NYSCT a bigger and better part
of'the State University of New York.

With all the emphasis on enlarge-
ment and improvement. everyone in
State College should be looking
toward the future with brighter
hopes. Recently. a committee was
set up by the WAA Council to in-
vestigate plans for an organization
in the athletic ﬁeld that will enable
WAA to expand efﬁciently and
democratically as the school grows.
In the future We can see before us
a new athletic ﬁeld, an athletic
dorm. and possibly even the chance
of earning a Physical Education mi-
nor at this school.

With this in mind. the committee
has prepared a report and drafted
a constitution for an athletic or-
ganization at State College that will
not only coordinate the activities of
men and women students. but will
increase the participation in sports
and give them an opportunitv to ex-
pand.

To Be Called “AA”

The new athletic organization, to
be called “AA,” will be composed of
ﬁve councils. These shall be Men's
Varsity. Women's Intramurals. Men's
Intramurals. Women‘s Special Ev-
cnts. and Clubs. Each council is to
be composed of representatives
elected from the individual sports
under their organiation and they
will coordinate and guide these
sports.

All the ofﬁcers of the Councils
shall be elected by all active mem-
bers in that division. which means
that the active intramural partici-
pants will choose their own intra-
mural ofﬁcers. The Clubs Council is
to be a joint men's and women’s or—
ganiiilion. and two chairmen shall
be elected. Each of these speciﬁc

Ted Defeats Larry;
Goes To Semi-Finals

Friday. April 14. the Commons
crowd ﬁnally got to see the quarter-
ﬁnals table-lennis match between
Ted Strauss and Larry LaJohn. The
vic was turned off promptly at two—
thirty (after being turned on at
two-twenty-cighti and LaJohn took
his fifteen minute warm-up. follow-
by Strauss who was warmed up by
Noble for was it the other way
around?! Strauss took the ﬁrst
game 21-15. after LaJohn closed up
a 20-10 bulge. LaJohn squeezed out
the second in a deuce game: 22-20.
The lhird and fourth games went
cusin lo Strauss, who now meets
Tony Davey for the chance to play
Doc Hoyt for the championship.
This mulch has been set for
Wednesday. (It might be hoped that
the ﬁnals will be arranged and play-
cd before graduallonl.

ft is nice to know that the doub-
ics tournament is finally being held
~-wondcr how long it will take ! i !

councils shall be supreme in its own
sphere and shall handle any and
all business that may arise per-
taining to'it.

Provide Standing Committees

To provide working coordination
between the separate councils, sev-
eral committees of a permanent na- .
ture will be set up. A ﬁnance com-
mittee, composed of the treasurers
of each council shall get together
with their individual budgets to
draft one large and complete AA
budget. Working in this manner, the
treasurers will get an over-all look
at the needs and desires of each
council, and waste and inefﬁciency
will be avoided. A record committee.
made up of all the council secretar-
ies. will take care of the records for
the athletic awards to be offered
every spring. Records all kept in
the same place will be easier and
much more efﬁcient not only for
awards. but also for preparing vot-
ing lists and taking inventory of the
participation in each club. Another
committee, the Publicity Committee,
shall be composed of all the Vice—
Presidents. A need was felt for a
coordination of this activity. espe-
cially as the number of activities
offered grows and expands.

Plan Coordinating Group

The largest coordinating body
shall be the Coordinating Commit-
tee composed of the heads of each
of the councils. Here, any disputes
between the councils may be worked
out and an over-all time and activi-
ty schedule for the whole year ar-
ranged. This body shall meet ap-
proximately six times a year. but
may be called into a meeting ween”
ever any situation arises to warrant
it.

Plus Separate Boards

A separate Women's Athletic
Board and Men's Athletic Board will
be set up as an advisory body to
coordinate the work needed to be
done separately by the men and
women: such as awards, banquets.
and other individual pieces of busi-
ness. Honor Council, for the women,
will be a member of this Board and
they will be in charge of some nom-
inations.

The newly proposed Athletic As-
sociation will be of lasting beneﬁt
to State College students. Sports will
all be coordinated and well-organ-
ized and there will be no duplica-
tion in the ordering of supplies. The
men and women will be able to work
more amicably together and still
each council will be independent.
The organization will be more dem-
ocratic since the sports managers
will be directly elected by the par-
ticipants in that sport and will then
become representatives on one of
the councils.

Ask Student Ideas

This is the plan the committee has
proposed. It is their opinion that it
will prove of great beneﬁt to the
whole student organization to plan
machinery for expansion in later
years. If you have any suggestions
or questions. please contact either
Fat Jai or Al Holliday immediately.
Thcv are anxious to ﬁnd out if this
is the organization YOU want.
