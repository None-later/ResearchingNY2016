Eich, Clearwater

Pitcli Four Hitter

The State College baseball team
will open the 1950 home season to-
day when they face the ABC nine.
The Peds started the away season
last Saturday by walloping TCC 10

the pitching of Eich and Clearwater
and the hitting of Line Mai-zello
and Al Kaehn.

Bullet Bob Eich worked the first
five innings for the statesmen and
gave up two singles and two un-
earned runs. Bob struck out 8 men
and walked 4. Clearwatcr came on
in the sixth and gave up only two
more hits and another run. Harv
struck out two and issued three
walks.

Lin: Marzcllo led the Feds in hit-
ting by smashing out three hits for
as many times at the plate. Killer
Kaehn got three hits in five times
at bat to place second in this de-
partment. Paul Carter and Bill En-
gelhart also did some fine hitting.
Each of these boys got two hits in
four trips to the plate. The Pcds
garnered fourteen hits from the
slants of three Triple Cities College
pitchers.

The Feds swung into high gear in
the first inning when they scored
four runs. Carter reached first when
the third baseman crrorcd on his
ground ball. Engclhart thcn sacri-
ficed Carter to second. Welch had a
streak of wildness and walked the
next. three men to face him thus
scoring Carter. Cohen came in to
relieve Wclch at this time and was
greeted with a two-run double off
the but of Line Marzello. Cohen er—
rorczl on Rutlcy's hot grounder and
Duffus scored. McConvillo fanned
and Eich grounded out. catcher to
first, to end the inning.

to rattle the side. B-.nghamten
found that they srill couldn't get a
run off Eich. Scrinzi got a hit but
was left on second. '

The men from State got two hits
in the top of the third but were un-
able to capitalize on them. Kane
grounded out short to first. DuiIus
was robbed of a sure double when
Walling- made a beautiful catch of
his line drive to left field. Marzello
and Rutley came up with a pair of
safeties but McConville flied out to
end the rally. TCC proved that it’s
never to late to start when they got
two runs with two men out in the
bottom of the third. They got two
runs on a single. two walks and an
error. Eich struck the first two men
out and thrn got into trouble. Sim-
mons ended the inning by flying out
to Rutlcy.

Mike LaManna will be the sen-
sation of the nation. for he has
just been extended an invitation
to join the National Golfers As-
sociation of America. Because of
his low shooting ion the links)
three members of the association
spoke for Mike. or so the letter
he received said. That’s right.
Mike has received an invitation
from the NGA and they also
sent him a red and white check-
ed golfers hat as an inducement
to join. Mike. for some unknown
reasons. believes this is just a
practical joke being played on
him; but if he can raise the $200
dues he will look into the situa-
tion. Well. even though he might
NOT join Mike can still be proud
of that sharp hat he owns . . .
only he seemed to be a little
afraid to wear it after hearing
tales of Senator McCarthy.

 

Strauss Beats Davey;
Plays Don Hoyt Today

The semi-finals of this year's
table—tennis tourney ended in vic-
toiy for Ted Strauss. as usual. Wed-
nc.~.day he defeated Tony Davey in
three out of four games.

A better than average Commons
crowd gathered at 2:30 to watch the
prtliminnry warm-ups. At 3:00 the
mulch got underway. Davey jumped
off to a fast start on his serve, and
built up a lead which won him the
first game, 21-18.

Strauss took over the serve. and
the offensive. from the outset of the
second game and slammed past his
opponent, 21-4. The third and fourth
games. although not quite so lop-
sided, left no doubt in the minds of
the spectators that Ted Strauss is n
muster of the game he plays. The
third game went to a 21-8 count
unit the fourth lasted to 21-11.

Strauss has now rolled over all his
opposition. ncvcr losing more than
one game in a match. It remains for
Doc Hoyt to keep him from rolling
right. into the chumpionship, us he
did lust your. Last year Ted Strauss
u‘so followed up his State Chum-
pionship with u trip to Chicago.

Strauss mccts Doc Hoyt this nft-
crnoon at 3:00. Come early if you
want it good scat.

_ —

This was going to be called Raves
and Razzes; but the only thing I
can think of to rave about is:
if the new “AA” Constitution is
passed—rumor has it that State will
use the New Scotland Ave. Armory
next year. Rave that the Jerks won
their first game of two seasons.
What Happened? But congratula-
tions, anyhow.

Banner Hunt?

Once upon a time there was
something around State College
called Rivalry. What happened?
Time was when five points weren’t
too much trouble for a couple of
classes to wage bloody battle over;
and this columnist thinks our
younger classes are going chicken
on us. Why bother with Rivalry at
all?

About Softball—why wasn’t the
league schedule put up more than
six hours in advance? The teams
that played on Monday didn’t know
they were playing until that after-
noon.

Why are some teams scheduled to
play more often than others at Bev-
crwyck Park; which is rocky, in-
cessable. and crawling with Albany's
(you'll pardon the expression)
younger generation?

Why does Commuters’ Club (made
up for the most part of working,
far-traveling students) get games
scheduled on Saturdays?

To the Rivalry Committee—when
Rivalry Football was re-scheduled
MAA lost a day of intramural
play; this past week MAA's softball
league gave up a day for Rivalry
Softball; what happened? It was
re-schcduled and the field again
went unused.

What's happened to the five dol-
lars in the MAA ping-pong line? We
haven’t seen any MAA bought balls
or new paddles? How about a new
not, or better yet a new table?

Men’s Athletic Association has
posted the following nominees for
organization officers for next year:
President: Pat Dooley, Ed Matt-
hews Harvey Milk, Ronald Rock-
hill; Vice-President: Robert Brown.
Donald Burns. Morton Frank, Doug
Thorne; Financial Secretary: Bob

Angels Cop Two,
Take First Place,-
KB Wins Twice

This past week saw the battle of
the two remaining undefeated
teams, the Angels and the EEP's,
take place in Page. In the first of
the two out of three games series.
the Angels came from behind and
wan going away, 15-12. The EEP’s
retaliated in the second game and
eked out a 15-13 decision. This
meant that the leadership of the B
League hinged on the outcome of
this third and final game of the
series in which the Angels started
out fast and were never headed as
they won a decisive 15-3 victory.
This victory just about clinched the
B League title for the Angels unless
they get upset, which is very un-
likely.

KB Upsets Youngsters

In A League play, an upset was
recorded when KB toppled the
Youngsters from the league lead.
This could almost have been mis—
taken for a replay between the An-
gels and the EEP’s. KB won the first
game 15-12. the exact score that
the Angels beat the EEP’s by in the
first game. The second game the
Youngsters came back and took KB
to the tune of 15-9. a little bigger
margin of victory than the EEP's
had in their game. In the final
game KB massacred the Youngsters
15-1 as compared to the 15-3 swamp-
lng of the EEP's by the Angels.

In the other games played. KDR
beat SLS. who in turn took the toll
of the Lovers in a game played on
Saturday. The other game scheduled
was forfeited to the Angels when
the Mttey Mites failed to show up
for this contest.

Championship Game Scheduled

Tomorrow in Page Gym at 1:30
p. m. the play-off between the A
League and B League leaders will
take place. As it stands now it looks
like it will be the Angels versus
either Potter or KB.
