“What do you want included in
the new Student Union?" was the
question asked in a State College
News poll this week. One bystander
said at the time the question was
posted above the reply box, “That's
an inclusive question.”

As predicted, the answers included
many points of view. Some departed
somewhat from practicality (“I want
four blondes and six redheadsl")
while others indicated sincere and
constructive thought.

“A swimming pool" was the most
often voted. One doubtful answerer
put a question mark after the sug-
gestion. Apparently, that person had

some doubts about the success of his
request. Next in student attention
was a snack bar. This was coupled
in one case with a request for a
place to dance. Many people asked
for study rooms, and rooms where
committees could meet.

How the rooms for organizations
would be apportioned was not speci-
fied, but one person asked that Mu-
sic and D&A Councils, which at
present do not have a headquarters
or special room, be given them. The
same request was made for religious
clubs.

Of the not so serious Staters who
gave the poll deep thought, one
suggested a “card table and crap
table," and another wrote “A BAR”
in caps.

“I want included in the new Stu-
dent Union Eve Wolfe," wrote a stu-
dent. Miss Wolfe, Feature Editor of
the News apparently has an un-
known admirer.

The most complete answer came
from a writer who possibly had con-
fused the Student Union with Santa
Claus. The stipulation was, “One
million dollars plus taxi”

Move Up Date
For Occupancy’
Oi New Dorm

The new State Residence Hall and
Student Union will not be available
for occupancy until second semester
of next year, it was announced Wed-
nesday by Dr. Evan R. Collins, Pres-
ident oi‘ the College.

Dr. Collins has stated that, while
there is every reason to believe that
the new building will be ready for
occupancy in February, the serious—
ness of the housing problem facing
the college next September is not
lessened. With increased enrollment
expected. it will be necessary to
“create” some new facilities next
year.

in accordance with this announce--
mom. and with the support of the
Alumni Association, which has co—
operated with the college in the so—
lution of the problem, Dr. Ellen C.
Stokes, Dean of Women, has releas—
ed the following program for next
year.

1. All Alumni Residence Halls
must again be used as they were this
your. Particularly. Suyles H2111 must
house women.

2. These Halls can. with the use
of some cloublc-dcckcr beds. be made
to accommodate approximately 60
more students.

3. The number of students renting
rooms in private homes will be in-
creased by about 15"}.

4. If the new Residence Hull is
ready as expected at the beginning
of second semester, it will be open-
cd for the rcnuiindcr oi" the your to
men. In September, 1951, Sziylcs Hall
will, of course. be opened to turn.
