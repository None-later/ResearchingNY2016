A Change in Procedure . .

Once again registration time is upon us. In the
cases of Seniors, ﬁnal registration cannot be com-
pleted next week, but for all other classes, what they
do next week, and how well they do it, determines
how much time will be spent by them at fall reg-
istration.

Under the new procedure, as listed in the News
three weeks ago, anyone Who makes out his sched-
ule completely and correctly now, so that no changes
will be necessary in the fall, will be exempt from
the long and tiring procedure of standing in line
to have class sections checked. From the view of
both the administration and the student body this
will speed up the process for everyone.

Everyone recognizes the fact that some changes
are necessary and unavoidable. With this system,
however, the administration has the whole sum-
mer to check schedules and make section assign-
ments, if any are necessary.

The fact that complete registration now will cut
down on the time necessary in the fall does not
mean that anyone will not have to be present for
the fall procedure. It does mean, however, that you
have only to ﬁll out schedule cards and pay the
necessary fees. In normal procedure this requires
only a few minutes of the hours of time usually
spent in the Commons in September.

So, if yoli are going to be busy in September, or
are‘just interested in saving a little time during
your ﬁrst days back, think a little more carefully
than usual when you ﬁll out the trial schedules next
week.

A Good School . . .

The school year is divided by the important days
and events connected with the students. Moving-Up
Day, for example, separates from the rest of the
school year that last push before exams, summer,
and graduation.

That means that when Moving-Up Day arrives,
“it is later than you think."

One of the primary precepts of teaching or im-
proving any thing is that of praise for what is good,
instead of constant criticism and pointing out of
what is bad.

For a change, let‘s examine the really good things
at State. First, it is a good school. State has a repu-
tation for being a “hard” school, and that means
that the students (/0 learn. While we are apt to criti-
cize particular phases of our learning, usually that
comes more from a resistance to work than from
any basic fault with the system.

Most students ﬁnd that by the time they are
Seniors, the members of the faculty ill their depart-
ment are respected friends. The more of this that
we develop (by “English evenings" and other
means) the better our college experince will be.

Teaching either in the ﬁeld or at Milne usually
turns out to be one of the most satisfying experi-
ences that college can offer.

We have long prided ourselves on our student in-
dependence in government and student affairs. Per—
haps we take it a bit too much for granted, bill it is
one of the best things at State, that loss of student
responsibility for these things would cause a spon-
taneons uproar.

And in spite of all the kidding we do about
"wheels," we do develop some outstanding people
through our system of extra-currictilar activities.

Our system of activiti s, while it is actually the
phase of oiir life which .s most often under fire, iii
one particular area or another, is one of tile best
things about us. 'l‘here is no coercion, yet the peo-
ple who are interested can engage lll almost any
activity. '

We could go on for many lines about [he good
things at State. Perhaps it is time someone did.

will be raised quite a. bit if the “leaners” aren't more

careful.

TO GO FORMAL OR NOT TO GO FORMAL . . .

FIREMANIA . . .

Ever think that the crepe paper decorations in low—
