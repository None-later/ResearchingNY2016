To the Editor:

I am going to answer Mr. Pro-
chiio’s letter of last week word for
word and then we’ll see if he will
continue lying- or admit that he is
unworthy of his position in our stu-
dent administration]

Every accusation I have made is
completely and absolutely true.
'ihere is nothing to be gained by
lies on my part because I cannot get
back the money I lost on the char-
tered coaches. I stand by my claims
—past. present, and future.

Mr. Prochilo says he was not ask—
ed for a bus ride announcement in
assembly. I signed up on the list in
Husted for an announcement and
I spoke to him before assembly. Has
Mr. Prochilo forgotten the argument
we had on the second floor of Drap-
er Hall after assembly that day? Ask
him! Has he forgotten that he told
me he didn‘t care how much money
I had invested in the bus trip, even
if it was a million dollars? Ask himi
Has he forgotten that he said my
announcement didn’t pertain to the
student body as a whole? Ask him!

As for my notice in the paper—I
never asked to put in an ad and I
never expected one for nothing. Ken
Orner ‘52. asked me for an article.
Since the regular News staff didn‘t

la}. Mum/119m rm: 

(oppoglu i‘mi, Luau II N Milli» 'l‘niwui to

print this "Soph" issue we can’t
blame anyone.

As for proof that Mr. Prochilo did
have something to do with mutilat-
ing my signs I submit the name of
David Manley ’52. This young man
was appointed by Mr. Prochilo, along
with two others. to handle train ar-
rangements. Mr. Manley was braz~
en enough to sign his name to an
ad and put it immediately over
mine on the bulletin board in lower
Draper. I brought this ad before
Myskania. Ask them if I didn't!

Arguing over the character of
some of our Myskania members is
like debating whether cream puffs
ll.l\'0 cream. They have character.
but how much and what kind is a
different matter.

Mr. Prochilo says that no one
would stoop to such business, but I
say, and am willing to go on prov-
ing". that ho stooped to further his
peisonal aims. It would not look
very Igood if a project undertaken
by the student President were de-
footed.

Do you deny any of these facts
Mr. Prochilo? Can you honestly say
that a single word I have written is
false? Keep this tip—the student
hotly is losing all its faith in you.

Tonight and tomorrow night will
be Albany’s last chances to view a
production of this year’s stock com-
pany of the Playhouse. Saturday
night, the Playhouse will close its
doors, to open again early in the
fall. The current production, “Born
Yesterday,” is one of the most hi-
larious of this year’s presentations,
and has been extremely well received
by the city's theater-goers. Play-
house regulars who appear in this
production include Judson Pratt,
Dodie Bauer and Thomas Rogers.

On Wednesday night, May 10, the
Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo will
make a one-performance appearance
at the Palace Theater. The Ballet
Russe ended its engagement at the
Metropolitan Opera House in New
York last Saturday night and then
left immediately for Boston where
six performances will be made. The
company will then go to Portland,
Maine and from there come to Al-
bany to end one of its longest sea-
sons. 36 straight weeks. The entire
company and grand orchestra will
appear in Albany. In the Albany
performance. four ballets will be on
the program. "Swan Lake." “Pa-
quita,“ “Blue Bird," and “Raymon-
da." Reserve tickets are now on sale.
