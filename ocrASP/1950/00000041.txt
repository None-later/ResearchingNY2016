Support Them . .. .

Today means the beginning of a new year for
State College Student Association and all of its
budget supported organizations.

In assembly today new ofﬁcers of SA will begin
their year’s work serving the student body. :lhe
1949-50 ofﬁcers will bow out, with mixed feelings
of satisfaction of a job completed and of nostalgia
on leaving the responsibility and the relationships
of their jobs.

One of the ﬁrst tasks of new ofﬁcers will be pre-
siding at the four assemblies which are left for con-
sideration of the proposed Student Assocration
Budget. They will be doing their best to see that
your opinions are reflected in this budget. .VVlth
these four assemblies that remain, your intelligent,
constructive criticisms of the budget will be neces-
sary. For a budget and a student tax which will
reﬂect these sound changes, if any, your undivided
support for your new ofﬁcers, will be necessary.

Budget hearings are only the beginning of the
year’s program and SA ofﬁcers are only examples of
people or positions on campus which demand your
support this coming year. You have elected 13
members to your judicial body, Myskania. This
group as it now stands is the object of heavy criti-
cism. However, it is made up of people in which
you have put your conﬁdence. If you believe that
this group is given duties not concurrent with its
honorary connotation, don't criticize its members
or its decisions. Disapproval of a group might rath-
er be shown in legislation this year which would
change the status of the body. We are NOT advo-
cating that Myskania be abolished, rather that its
decisions as they now stand be supported during
the coming year.

Like other elected persons, Class presidents de-
serve the continued interest and backing of their
classes who have elected them.

A Student Association made up of members who
have faith in their representatives will have a suc-
cessful year. Their representatives will act with
conﬁdence in carrying out their jobs.

Thanks . . .

This is the last issue of the Stale College News
for the present year. As the. new staff takes over
the job we would like to make clear that the
News will continue to bring the news of happenings
at State to the student body with the least possible
bias. Before we begin our job we would like to
pay tribute to our retiring editor.

A college newspaper can only be successful when
leadership is present. It can be printed every
Friday only when a person with a technical knowl-
edge of newspapers is directing its activities. An
editor who has an efficiently working system has
a better newspaper on the stands. The 1949-50
editor of the State College News is a leader. has
the technical knowledge, and developed a working
system. but more than that she leaves the News
with the heartfelt thanks of her cohorts for the
splendid personal relationships which are present
on the News. We tip our bonncts and crew hats
and beanies as an excellent editor and friend bows
out. We will do our best to score a "Statesworthy"
News for 1050-51.

STATE COLLIGI NEWS. FRIDAY. MAY 12. 1950

By MOLLY

It was fitting last week that His
mind and His spirit be soaring, and
that His collegiate soul be ﬁlled with
"up" of things, but tomorrow, He
ought to discard the cane and the
hat and the jargon and take a look
at the “down.”

“Oh, I’d like to marry a profes-
sor.” says the girls room prattler,
“and live among books and people
of culture.”

“Ugh,” says the spirit. “Down.”

Collegiate provincialism is driving
a wedge between the college-bred
and the world-matured. It threatens
to estrange Him from the function
backbone of His society. Even part-
time working . . . or summer bell-
hopping, He feels intangibles htat
separate Him from ordinary men.
He prefers the resort employer who
hires “only college kids” . . . He
would rather discover a worded
prniciple in a “great book,” than a
workable contract with living people.

“He's dead?” ventures the spirit
of Down.

He has, during His collegiate years
found a sanctuary, and a comfort-
able label. He hasn't had to estab-
lish a harmony with the “all sorts"
that make up communities. It had
been pleasanter (and less pertinent)
to contemplate on His relationship
to the Universe, than His place
place among men. Now . . . with
the “moving up‘: the temptation to
embrace for the good of the remote
world of abstraction. It is especially
aimed at the student of Education.
Many have already succumbed.
lSome become professorsi

“Don't” says the spirit of Down.

His supposed singularity is based
on the myth that because His ma-
turation took place in college its
fruits are deeper and more noble
than those of His brother, who de-
veloped in the shop or on the farm.
He has paid for “education.” and He
must have paid for “something.”
Since He can see no significant dif-
ference between His brother and
Himself, He figures the “something”
must be abstract and spiritual. That,
of course. makes is double sancti-
fied, and much more meaningful.

A part of the “something” that
college proves  the quality of in-
telligence. It is significant that so-
c i a l psychologists lacademically

MULLIGAN
trained), while continually playing
down its functional use, are con-
stantly re-defining it. It no longer
means solely the ability to read
books . . . it means persuing a so-
cial goal, generalizing, having cre-
ative ideas, being able to overcome
emotional pressures . . . it means
all sorts of subjective things that
promise security to those who can
claim it.

“Oh, He's irritable at times, and
He can’t keep a Job.” says the girls-
room prattler. “but He’s so-o-o in-
telligent . . . why most of the time
nobody knows what He’s talking
about."

The spirit of Down doesn’t grasp
the signiﬁcance.

He concludes that. by the time He
moves “up” for the last time, He
will have been exposed for so long
(in archives) to the dusty conscience
of history‘s educated thinker’s that
He will hold a certain set of noble
ideals and high principles . . . un-
known to technicians . . . that will
equip Him for moral leadership.

The spirit of Down recalls that
some of His best friends have morals
. . that social values are quite
standardized, and quite fundamental

that they spring from man's
association with men, and are dis—
played quite adequately by plumbers,
soda-jerks and mothers, who have
not bothered to semanticize them.

The rigmarole of college has
forced on Him a slew of patterns of
taste and sensitivity and expression.
that have little relationship to the
candid feelings of His own organism.
These may cloud His eyes to the life-
facts in the world around Him.

It would be educational for Him
. to find people in a people's
world, to work for the sake of the
scheme of work. And if he feels the
responsibility of leadership. to go.
not with humility before the uni-
verse and dignity . . . to mankind.
but with a receptive mind toward
other men of apprenticeship. Then,
He will experience more satisfactori-
ly His life in a community; He will
gain a more realistically balanced
perspective; and He will be able
perhaps to teach children instead of
words.

Then the spirit of Down will say
“Whoopee” . . . He’s moving up.

To the Editor:

In the Common-Stator column
last week the suggestion was made
to (icicle the soccer line from the
MAA budget in order to have a $17
Student Tax next year instead of
the proposed $17.50 tax. It is my
opinion that the. writers of this
column are looking at the problem
from the wrong angle. The purpose
oi our Student Tax is to provide
money to finance activities in which
there is a definite Student Associa-
tion interest. and it seems wrong to
me to try to keep a constant Stu-
dent Tax in the face of increasing
costs and increasing interests, pro-
vided of course. that. the tax does
not become cxcessivo.

That a definite. interest in soccer
exists was shown by the action of
Student Association last fall in up-
pi'opriiiiing money to equip and fi—
iinncc a team. As to the second
point mentioned above. a tax of
$17.50 may, at first glance seem rath-
er high. Hmvcvci'. if we look at the
'arious benefits and activities which
we may see or participate in as a re-
sult of our Student Tax. the sum
does not seem to be as large as it.
did at first. if we then compare our
own tax to that of some other col—
leges, we. see that our tax is small
ii; comparison, yet We offer a very
comprclicnslVe and very diversified
program. Our program compares
very favorably with that of other
schools charging a higher Student.
'l'ax.

'l‘lici'efore. i would like to ask the
members of Student Association to
consider all budget items this year
lll terms of iiitreest. on the part. of
the members of Student Association.
not in terms of $.50 or $1. The time
to think more of the monetary val—
uc of our Student ’i‘ax will be. when
our Student Association budget be-
conus excessive. and it is not ex-
cessive yet.

ltonaltl ltockhill '51

To the Editor:

In my four years at State, I have
never heard such poor judgment in
a rivalry decision as in the Moving-
Up Day sing. The freshmen were far
superior in originality. execution.
performance. qua l i t y, harmonic
structure. and participation .It. was
an obvious “walk—away" for the class
of 1953, and the Sophomores didn‘t
even offer competition to the fresh-
men .011 what (lid the Judges base
their decision?

Let this be a. lesson to next year‘s
Rivalry Committee to choose more
carefully the judges. Take into con—
sideration such things as ability, cx-
perlcncc. competence and. above all,
choose judges who are not still wov-
ing their class banner.

Audrey Koch '50

To the Editor:

There has been 11 great deal of
question. and justly so. as to when
the 1050 l'edogogue will be ready for
distribution. At this time. it. is im-
possible to determine the exact (late
when the l'cdagogoe will come out.

i sincerely apologize that the book
did not come out before Moving~Up
Day. as has been the custom. llow-
erer. i should like to assure the
student body that there Will be it
l'ctlagoguc. and that it will most cer-
tainly be out before exams. 1 hope
that cveryonr‘s anxiety Will be coni~
pciisnti-d for by a satisfactory pubv
licutioii.

The Common-Stator is given the widest latitude as
author of this column, although his viewpoints do
not necossm'i‘ly reflect those of the STATE Common
News.

GLADNESS AND SADNESS . . .

Every Moving-Up Day is a combination of these
two. Whatever the outcome is. every organization can-
not be composed entirely of ofﬁcers; it also needs
people who will continue to have enough interest to
voice opinions and help their leaders to attain a suc-
cessful year for their organization.

MAA ﬁnally got around to awarding letters to the
men who have earned them during the past few years
by participating in athletics. incidentally. these awards
received $150 from our budget last year, and there is
a $181 line in next year's.

Goddess Minerva, alias Barbara Newcombe, was
crowned at the successful Commuters' Club formal.

EYE OPENERS . . .

. . . in more ways than one. Music Council is bright-
ening our halls by its publicity drive for the Spring
Concert. From past experience we can say it. has al-
ways been worth attending.

. . new furniture is now being put to use in the
Lounge. This is the furniture which the State pro-
vided and it is really nice—modern and above all.
comfortable. Really makes a lounge out of our Lounge.

SOME OF THIS YEAR’S NEW-[TIES . . .

. . a real Co-op with a proﬁt sharing plan for stu-
dents . . . construction of a new Dorm and Commerce
building . . . a new President . . . an inter-collegiate
soccer team . . . a coke machine that makes change

. second semester rushing . . . dime minimum at
the Boot competition for the Boul called the
Waldorf.

0th FINAL GlthES AND HOPES
FOR NEXT YEAR . . .

Better assembly attitudes . . . more discussion from
the floor . . . increased interest.

More “For the good of the order" sessions to get
those gripes out of our systems.

Continuation of Rivalry with its main thought—Good
inter-class relations and less all-out competition.

No Rivalry vandalism such as Baimer snatching and
Campus Day Cup disappearances . . . or destruction
of publicity in our halls.

Shifting of the Rivalry bulletin board to a better
location and keeping it up to date.

The return of moneys made On the Big-4‘s to the
classes.

One long bulletin board in lower Draper instead of
the numerous small ones.

Solution to the "library door by the Commons al-
ways seems to be closed on all miserable days” problem.

Improvement of the Book Exchange planning.

Expansion of the number of stores on Central Ave-
nue offering a 10"; discount to State students.

Fewer appropriations from that ever-decreasing
surplus.

Return of the Senior and Junior banners to the
Common's walls.

Scheduling of athletic events and formals so that.
they do not conflict.

Bigger attendance at athletic events and a real
winning team.

Continuation of use of the Palace Theater for grad-
uation exercises.

Continuaiton of placements for students with Baclnu
lor's degrees.

Fewer stairway problems as in Draper and Richard-
Still.

The return of Faculty shows.

 

 

LYON'S LAST WORDS . . .

in looking over Bill's final suggestions. we find some
of them have materialized during the past year.
Among them:

The student loan fund has been established and is
now in the process of being legalized.
' ’i‘lie Commuters took over the problem of provid—
ing an additional formal and produced an extrava—
ganza for MUD, which. with more planning should
revive the old tradition

The class ring situation seems to have been ini-
provcd if the number of complaints is any indication.

Yarions organizations continued the post—basketball
rclrcslnncnl and entertainment program for visiting
trams.

Student Board of Finance will be composed of at
least four Commerce students next. year.
