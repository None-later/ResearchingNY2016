Our Student Association budget

‘comes up in assembly today and the

ﬁght begins. Some people want to
balance the budget at $17, some
are willing to let the tax be $17.50.
And there are some students who
don’t want certain organizations to
spend money for different lines——
they will use anything they can for
their purpose. And they are going
all out in an attempt to balance the
budget at $17, not so much because
oi the ﬁfty cents they want to save,
but because they have some silly
idea that they are being taken for
a ride.

The same light came up before
Student Council last week. I would
like to quote what one person said,
‘Some of us are interested in some
kinds of organizations and some of
us are interested in other kinds. We
must help and support these other
organizations in order to expect
them to support us." If we all would
believe in that. we wouldn‘t have
111131 stupid arguments that do noth—
ing but waste time and hurt some
people's feelings.

It seems to me that there are two
main types of organizations or
groups on campus—athletic and non-
athletlc. From where I sit it also
seems that the "athletic" group
very seldom attacks the budget and
reasoning of the “non-athletic"
groups, while the reverse is not rtuc
by far. The big fight on the budget
every year seems to collie when some
small group of selfish students by
to cut the athletic budget. They
usually fall after wasting our time
in Student Council and in assem-
bly. This same group tried to cut
the soccer line from the MAA bud-
gcl last Week: again they failed
miserably. Will they ever wake up
and realize that although this is noI
an athletic college. by far, we DO
want, to have a decent ulhlclic pro-
gram, one we can be proud of.

This your the students. by an
ourwhclming majority, voted for

good start and with bright hopcs
for the future several pcoplc want.
to kill 11. oil—not only will that, be
a waste of our money. but 11. would

ycur but no one expected as good a

Sluglest Won
By Suspenders;
Bisceeps Shutout

SL8 plays host to Kappa Beta to-
day on Page Field at 4:30, and KDR
meets Kappa Beta at noon tomorrow
to complete the fourth week of In-
tramural Softball play.

In what will prooably be the most
important game of the season, the
Suspenders topped Potter Club Moti-
day, 19-15, to remain undefeated and
take undisputh possession of first
place in the “A” League. Both teams
were undefeated before the game.
Potter Club has disputed the (leci-
sicn of League Manager Bob Krell-
ing in calling the game at the 0nd
of the fith inning. Potter claims
tl‘at Krcllinjr has no official right
to call the game. and that that pow-
cr lies only with the umpires. The
game was called at 6:45 to allow the
next schcduled game to be played.

By PAT JAI

Have you heard about the WIC?
What is it? Has the government set
up a tidy agency? No, it‘s the pro-
pt;.:c.l Women‘s Intramural Council
to be SLL up under the tentative
“AA” constitution. You’d probably
like to know who and how many
people will be on the council. what
lilC council doc... the officers, and
many other things.

The purpose of WIC is “to stimu-
late interest and participation in
intramural sports; to direct the ac~
mines of women's intramurals; to
consider all matters of interest and
importance to women's intramurals;
and to approve the budget submit-
tml by the treasurer." ’1his council
has jurisdiction over all sports which
illVL‘ organized leagues or tourna-
ments in which various Learns com-
pclc. Right now such sports as
hockey. volleyball. basketball, soft-
ball. and bowling are intramurals.

After each sport is completed, the
participants. who have earned the
ttquircd amount of credit hours. will
11ch for lhc manager and assistant
n‘unugcr to head the sport for the
following your. The manager will
be in chargc oi setting up all rules
and regulations for her sport. ob-
taining the necessary equipment,
and rcl‘erocing or umplring. The as—
:.‘sltllit manager will be responsible
for kt‘CMII; the participation rec-
ords and gcllcl'ully assisting the
Ill.lllll_,t“l‘. Both of these people shall
be represented on the WlC.

The Council itscll‘ .hull have six
oil‘lct-ra; president. vice-presicleni,
Ircrsurcr. sccrctary. office manager.
and freshman representative. All of
these offices, with the exception of
the I'rosh representative, are to inkc
oillcc on Moving-Up Day. The fresh-
lnau is Cit"‘LC(l 111 December of her
ire 'hman year. Any girl who has
crcdlt in onc intramural sport may
vote for three oiliccs. Any girl who
hits credit ill two of Ihcsc activities
is eligible to run for an office.

This is only a bare outline of the
Council that we hope to set up. The
constitution tor the new alhlctit us-
:»oclalion will be posted next week
and an clcctlon will be hech to find
out 11 11, ls supported by WAA. Plcasc
rca:l the constitution when it is
posicd. and be ready to lake a stand
ior or against it.

Angels Thrash
Potter For Title

In the volleyball championship
games which were held in Page Gym
on May 4 the Angels proved their
deﬁnite superiority over Potter Club
by defeating them in two straight
games 15-9 and 15-5. It was, more
than anything else, the spiking of
Bob Brown which led the Angels to
their victory. Ably setting up for
Brown were Bob Tabor and George
Glenday.

In the first game it looked like
Potter Club was going to roll on and
clinch another athletic trophy to be
placed r‘n the mantle over the ﬁre-
place in Potter House. They started
fast and before the Angels knew
what happened, Potter Club had
built up an 8-0 lead. At this point
the tide turned and it was the An-
gels Chance to move, and move they
did. While Potter Club was held to
one tnore point, the Angels went on
a scoring spree which netted them
the 15 points they needed to win.
Angels Land Final Blow

Before the start of the second
game some spectators ﬁgured that
Potter might cotne back. but right
at. the beginning the Angels jumped
into a 4-0 lead. Here Potter Club
momentarily forged ahead 5-4. but
this advantage was soon lost. From
this point the Angels proved once
and for all that they were the su-
perior team. It was a repeat per—
formance of the first game as the
Angels held Potter in check until at
the end, the scoreboard read, Angels
15, Potter 5.

Don Burt, manager of the volley-
ball league, should be commended
for the efficient manner in which
he handled the league.

Carter Leads
Team At Plate
With Three Hits

Outhit 9-5, Union College’s base-
ball team managed to eke out a 2-1
victory over our varsity nine in
Schenectady last Saturday. In spite
of Bob Eich‘s five-hit masterpiece,
three double plays and a barrage
of hits, one big stroke off the bat of
Cookie Sherwin made the difference
In the thrilling test. The sparkling
defensive play of our infield, and
the busy bat of Captain Paul Carter
was nullified in the warm sunshine.

Neither team scored until the op-
ponents slid an unearned run over
in the bottom of the fifth inning.
Then Sherwin got to first on an ill-
fated double play that saw the ball
thrown wide of first base. The
blcnde giant ambled on to second
and raced home as Krupa struck a
stinging single off Eich's foot.

Effort Scores Lone Run

Our lone run came In the seventh
as “ole” Herb Egcrt, subbing for the
ailing Mnrzello, came home on Eich's
long 11y to center. He led off the
inning with a sharp single to right
and was sacrificed to third by Rut-
ley.

In the eighth Carsky put State
down one, two. three. but. his team-
mates, led by Shcrwln's triple,
squeezed over the filial score of the
game.

Tomorrow Potsdam invades AI-
bany to face the pitching of Clear-
water or Egcrt. while yesterday
Plattsburg played the borne team
and faced Eich and Lien on the
mound.
