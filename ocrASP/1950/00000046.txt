I'm Doing Fine Ma, But Gee . . . Garcia Sends Out Soccer Call,
To Face Brockport Next Friday

Frosh Camp ls Mighty Conlusing

Dear Ma,

I went and I sung and now I'm
back. I’m confused now. I'm not
sure whether Frosh Camp is run
for the freshmen or the counsel-
ors. Anyway. the counselors had
lots of fun. I did too. of course,
after they defrosted me. I wouldn't
say it was cold. but when Harvey
blew his little whistle. the notes
froze on the way out, and we had
to put them in a frying pan to melt
to find out if he was blowing mess
call or swim call.

Swim call—that‘s when the up-
perclassmen would chop holes in
the ice so that we could find the
lake. Unless I had seen it myself,
I wouldn't believe it. but one
freshman actually went swimming
at 7 a. m., with the temperature
at 34 degrees!

There were 102 freshmen at the
camp this year, and according to
the counselors, this is a new rec-
ord high. Just th: same, the coun-
selors took a personal interest in
us all, except for the two counsel-
ors in my cabin Gordie Bennett
and Bob Roulicr, who disappeared
each night after 'ampfire and
didn‘t go to sleep till early in the
morning. I don‘t know where they
went, but they kept mumbling
something about darts and shuf-
flcboard. I guess there was a shuf-
flcboard set up in the lodge. but,

gee, I didn’t see it.

We went to camp and came back
from camp on buses. The upper-
classmen said that it was the first
time on record that we left and
came back on time.

When we got there. we were di-
vided into two teams. the “robbins
egg" blues and the “buttereup”
yellows. so that we could have
sports competitions. This was all
run by the camp athletic director,
Ronnie Rockhill, a real nice sport
himself. The blues won, by the
way, and I'm just thrilled to death
by the prize that we all got—a
whole box of Chiclets. I‘m still
chawln' mine, but I can’t get too
used to these liewfangled college
notions. and I still like pa‘s tabacky
better.

Saturday afternoon we had a
Counselors-freshman softball game
and the President of the college.
Dr. Collins. pitc‘hed part of the
garlic for the counselors. He looks
like a good Joe.

Friday and Saturday nights we
had campfire entertainments and
sings and I know now why these
frosh camps aren't co-ed. Joe Pur-
dy engineered some mighty fine
entertainment. and the boys liked
it fine.

So long now. I'll write you regu-
lar and keep regular. Love,

Phil Phrosh.

sports. clubs, and tournaments. Our
intramural sports are: soccer.
football. bowling, vollcyball. bas-

Following an overall program of
expansion and improvement, State
has added an assistant coach to its
Athletic department. His name is
Joe Garcia, and he arrives at
State via Illinois University. where
he obtained his BA and Ohio State
where he received his Master's De-
gree.

While at Illinois he was very ac-
tive in sports being on the varsrty
wrestling and soccer teams. Upon
graduating he moved on to Ohio
State where he was given his first
coaching assignment — assistant
wrestling coach.

Immediately upon his arrival at
State. Coach Garcia issued the call
for socer candidates. In reply, ele-
ven letter-men and approximately
fifteen new men tried out for the
first practice held in Beverwyck
Park. The Coach feels that one of
the reasons for the small number
of tryouts is that most of the fresh-
men do not know that they are
eligible for the team. Coach Garcia
wants this made clear; if there are
any freshmen who are interested in
trying out for the varsity soccer

team, they are welcome. and they
should report to Beverwyck Park
at four o’clock Monday afternoon,
or report to Coach Garcia if this
is not possible:

Wetherby, Bullock to Lead Squad

From early reports the mainstays
of the team will be the co-captains.
Dave Wetherby and Paul Bullock,
and Arnie Dansky and Raoul Nu-
nez. For the next few days the
coach is planning practices with an
eye toward conditioning.

In the next couple weeks. Coach
Garcia hopes to schedule several
other colleges for soccer competi~
tion. As a small beginnig toward
building-up a substantial rivalry in
scocer, he has signed two-year con-
tracts with several of the follow-
ing schools.

Games scheduled so far are:

Sept. 29 Brockport Home
Oct. 9 Plattsburg Away
Oct. 11 Albany Bus. Col. Home
Oct. 17 Siena Away
Oct. 25 Albany Bus. Col. Away

Faculty Succumbs To Freshmen

at frosh camp.

eleven innings before downing the
gallant faculty team. 4-3, with a
tWO out i‘ully that only succeeded
because of a faculty error.

they bunched three hits for their
only three runs. “Half-Nelson"
Garcia led off for the faculty. biit
he struck out. Reliable reports
have it that. he jumped into the
lake and hasn't been seen since.
’l‘hcii the faculty maulcrs started
to pour it on. After Roswell Fair-

pitch down the third base line. The
ball got by the left fielder. and.
probably thinking it was n dog,
rolled on into the woods. By the
tliiic the brill was returned in the
iriflcld. Jones had circled all four
bases (without stopping to i'cstii.
and the fi'osh had gathered ncw
respect for the lvy-covorcd profes-
sons.

The faculty's nioliicnt of glory
was shortlived. however. as John

nings. Although the "sad sticks" of

Althouin Allasio could have cir-

A constant hum comes from the
streets through the windows and
into my ears and all I can hear
is who’s going to win the series
and how about those Phil's—the
hum is almost deafening, it blocks
all other noise but beneath this
mighty hum I can manage to hear
the heavy breathing of a few men
who know that baseball is fading
out for the year and another sport
will take over. Up on Beverwyck
Park there isn't any talk of the
series, that’s i‘ar away, instead it
is hard work trying to get in shape
for the opening game of the sea-
son. Practice has been held all
week under the new coach, Joe
Garcia, and it’s a long hard fight
to get back in shape; but with
some good weather those extra
pounds will start to roll off and
the ball will be kicked around again
with that old zip.

 

They are doing their part to help
bring a good soccer team to State
—how about you? Will you be up
at Beverwyck next Friday to see
the opening galnc against Brock-
port—or will you be over at the
“Boul” reminiscfng about that won-
derful summer you had. Remember
the vacation is over and we all had

good rest—let’s start this year
with a new attitude and get up on
the right side of your bed.

I suppose I should have opened
this column with the usual wel-
come to the fresh but if you ask
me they‘ll be so sick of welcom-
ings by this time that they'll be
glad if they don’t get another
"Glad you’re here!" All I want to
say to the new students, and to
the upperclassmen too, is that it’s
not too late to form your intramural
football teams or to go out for
soccer. There are always several
disinterested souls now who will be
a bother to everyone in two weeks
trying to get on one of the teams.
Join or form a team now!

The summer school softball
league went off without too much
trouble. Five teams made up the
league but I dare not mention the

name of the winners.

again has sufcred a lost - ~ - this
time it‘s Jim Colcs who will be

Sports Editor:

There are a few sports-liiindcd
individuals at State College. but
they are few and far between. Coli-
sidcrnbic time and effort is spent
by these few to develop a sports
program which should afford acti-

 

 

vity for a large number of stil-
r'ients. however. each year it be-
comes more apparent. tlilit State

College Students are not interested
Ill their own sports activities.

Last year's attendance at the
basketball games \vouldn't have
done justice to a small high school.
New Pulls. a school coliipurnblc to
our own, sclit four buslouds of
students to support their team at
Albnny. 'l‘iiese students curiie here
although their team was lowing a
poor season. and had lost to State
previously. We, on the other hand.
could not raise one busloud.

This year could be the beginning
of a new States spirit. but the in-
dication of this will not come rui-
til next Friday when State plays
Brockport nt Beverwyck Park.
