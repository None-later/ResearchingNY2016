Europeans to this ’country and
finds them places to stay.

The girls are Hungarians who,
with their parents. lived in Ger-
many after the war. They learned
to speak English and worked while
living in Amsterdam. Nrﬂv York.
During their stay in their native
Hungary they attended the Univer-
sity in Budapest. receiving their
Doctorate Degrees in Economics
and their teaching diplomas.

The family recently moved from
Amsterdam to Albany in order
that the girls might attend school
here. They hope to secure enough
Education courses to certify them
to teach accounting and business
practice in our secondary schools.

When asked what impressed them
most about our college, both agreed
that the professors were much
closer than those with whom they
had come in contact.

Leaving their friends and fellow
classmates, they are here in the
United States to start on their way
to a new life.

ery has been named Professor of
Intercultural Education and Direct-
or the Center.

cry has four main objectives:

search centers for the study and
Improvement of intergroup rela-
tions.

2» Development and improvement
of means for testing and evaluating
the work of such centers.

3) Development. of materials, pro-
ccdlll'es and equipment for the im-
provement of learning in intergroup
relations.

41 Service as consultants to grad—
uate students and faculty members

Seeks Cooperation

Dr. Vickery stressed the fact that
in setting up this Center and to
make it work effectively, interested
students, faculty members. and rep-
resentatives Inust Work together in
planning what the Center can do.

Everybody involved will ha a a .jeh
to do in the action research end cf
it. Bv using the studies on the cur--
riculu. as well as extra-curricular
activities. students can help in the
studying of college life in a coin-
munity. Onc of" the Inany ways in
which the faculty could add to the
Center is by deciding what kind of

dents or the facility of other schools

ier communities.

Slow Boat To Co-op
May Yet Anchor

Ladies and gentlemen, this is
your New York reporter Walter
Winchell speaking. Serious dis-
order has been taking place at
State College since last Thurs-
day.

On the spot interviews have
quoted participants in the con-
fusion as follows: “Torture,”
says Maureen Duly, “I'd like a
hot dog and pop concession set
up," declares Alice Whittcmorc,
freshmen. “It's unnecessary,
but what would you do about it"
utters Evie Iii-die '52.

in this time of war strain and
atom bomb scare, this situation
could prove deadly. A line is a
line. but when it extends for a
whole corridor—that‘s going
somewhere.

However, when the (Io-op fi-
nally issues all new books on
hand. the excess chairs. benches
and people will disappear.

With a bright look to a more
“roomy” Co—op future—this is
W. W. saying—hang on—thc
best is yet to come!

DR. EVAN R. COLLINS

(Emu; Plan
Social Calendar

The Student-Faculty Committee.
according to Gerald Dunn ’51, Stu-
de'it Chairman. is attempting to
rectify the confusion of scheduling
events on the college social calen-
dar. The committee has planned a
meeting Tuesday. October 10 at 7:30
pm. in the Lounge for organization
representatives.

Due to the importance of and the
confliction arising from the ar—
rangement of dates. this meeting
should interest all organizations on
campus that have big events during
the school year, according to Dunn.

The representative sent to the
meeting should be thoroughly vers-
cd in the events of his organization
plans for the year, so that he can
make deﬁnite arrangements for
dates for these activities. The per-
son should be empowered to speak
for definite dates, and to accept a1-
ternate arrangements in the event
of conflicts.

If a delegate does not appear for
an organization, it is deemed only
fair that preference as to the choice
of dates be given to those organiz. -
tions sending representatives. As
there are lilnited dates available to
the committee. the absence of n
spokesman might result in the cur-
tIIilment of some of the organiza-
tion's activities.

Hence it is cxtrcmcly important
that cIIch group is represented at
this meeting. since the decisions
made by the delegates will be ac-
ccptcd by the Office of the Dean of
Women. according to Dunn.
