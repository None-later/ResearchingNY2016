United States are urged to join the
Crusade for Freedom. General
Dwight D. Eisenhower described
Crusade for Freedom as: "a cam-
paign sponsored by private Amer-
ican citizens to fight the big lie
with the big truth.”

Chairman of the Crusade for
Freedom, General Lucius D. Clay,
has issued a special appeal to col-
lege and university students, stat-
ing; “As students of history, liter-
ature, political, physical and social
sciences, you know that what men
believe to be true has been as im-
portant as the truth itself in de-
termining human events. Working
together in the Freedom Crusade,
we can help to put the free world
on the offensive."

To Install Freedom Bell

The Freedom Bell, symbol of the
crusade, will be installed behind the
Iron Curtain in the Western Sec-
tor of Berlin on October 24, United
Nations Day. Enshrined in the base
of the bell, which will peal out
daily, will be signatures of millions
of Americans who have signed the
Declaration of Freedom.

The volunteer organization for
this people‘s Crusade cut across all
lines . . . political, economic, rac-
ial, sex, religious. It consists of a
national council, regional, state,
city and county chairmen.

To Sign Freedom Scroll

Every college student can help
support the Crusade for Freedom,
General Clay points out, by doing
two things: sign the Freedom
Scroll, which in brief affirms his
belief as a free American in the
right of all men to freedom: and
make a contribution to the Cru-
sade, which will be used to help
expand Radio Free Europe, which
is the medium through which pri-
vate American citizens can fight
back against Communist attacks
upon the American way of life.

Kappa Beta. is far from being

a new fraternity, but judging
from the announcements made
by its president, Philip Malaf-
sky '51, it seems to have its
Share of new attractions. Found-
ed in 1937, the fraternity moved
to its present home at 288 Quail
Street in November of 1948.
Since that time it had not had
its face lifted.

This year, however, there is
something new. Housing four-
teen mcn, the house is full to
the rafters and is sporting a new
coat of paint outside, new floors
in the bath and kitchen, and a
new shower. The meals also are
much improved, being served by
a new chef.

Anything but new are Kappa
Beta‘s good times. For its first
alTalr of the your K“. is plan-
ing a. vic. dance for members
Saturday night, October 7.

Walker! I”.
But . . .

__ By HARVEY MILK

. . . Today the people of the Cap—
ital District will get a chance to
watch one of the nation’s top soc-
cer squads in action. Brockport has
built up a terriﬁc reputation among
the soccer world and this year they
will undoubtedly uphold their rep-
utation

. . . The Golden Eagles of Brock-
port have won 19 of their last 21
games, including one tie. Coach
Iluntley Parker and the squad have
been at work for the past four
weeks and are reporter! to be in
good condition. Their probable
starting lineup for the game will in-
clude two All-Americans; 'l‘ed Bodi,
who has been All-American for the
past three years, and the other All-
American is Don Thompson.

. . After the game with State
today the Eagles will take on RPI
tomorrow and it is my opinion that
their experience on the soccer ﬁeld
will send them back to Brockport
with a record of 2 wins and no de-
feats. Hope I'm wrong.

. . 'I‘hosc booklines in front of
thc (‘o-op look like a Salvation
Army soup line. If we. could only
gct that many people up to see to-
day's game! Around here students
will wait thrcc hours in a bookline
but can't give up two of their pre-
cious hours to watch a soccer game.
But that‘s Tradition!

. . . I hope Bob llausner, proxy of
intramural football. doesn't run into
the some trouble as past prexys; a
long list of complaints from play-
ers but. no help when the time comes
to do some work like lining the
fields. etc.

. . . From this corncr it looks like
the St. Mary's Angels will romp
over most of their opposition and
take the football championship.

. . . Work has been started to form
a college band; the only thing need-
cd now is plenty of talent. Anyone
interested should see Jerry McGory
today.

. Help is also wanted by Bob
Brown. He is looking for several
fresh and Sophs who will help him
work on the newly organizer] pub-
licity committee for MAA. Anyone
interested scc Bob.

. . Rifle Club. open to both
follows and girls, is opening its 1950
membership drive. There are no ﬁ-
nancial obligations, the only thing
you spcnd is your time—«and it‘s
worth it. According to Jim Lazzo,
hcad of fhc club, there are 9.000
rounds of ammunition and a good
supply of" Rifles. The club will teach
beginners how lo use a rifle and
polish if, too. If anyone is interested
come to Room 101 on Thursday. Be
seeing you there!

. . . This paper was printed before
last night's Pep Rally that was put
together at the last minute. Because
of the late announcement of i
not too many people were able to
nttcnd. But thcrc probably were a.
lot of” people who could have spent
one hour inkling to the spirit of it.
who just couldn't be bothered going
to it. I know I can say, without wor-
rying that I'm wrong, flint the
crowd at the rally was small.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS.

Touch Football
Starts Monday,
Outlook Bright

At 4:30 Monday afternoon, State
will kick the lid off the ’50 Intra-
mural Touch Football League. Four
teams, not named as yet, will open
the season on the Page Hall field
and at Beverwyck Park. Games will
be played at these fields daily till
a Champion is crowned.

League Manager bob Hausner
has arranged for a larger playing
surface for the games this year.
This will definitely increase the
pace and caliber of the games play-

ed. The ffelds have been widened-

7’-‘_' yards to 30 yards and the length
shall remain the same as last year.
60 yards.

At last report there were fifteen
teams entered in the race. Leading
the “repeat” teams from last year

will be the defending champion
Potter Club, Kappa Delta Rho,
Kappa Beta, Sigma Lambda Sig—
ma, Angels, and the Finks. New
blood in the league will be the
Gents, Jets. Van Derzee, Annex,

Thurlow Hall, Red Raiders, Capitol
District All-Stars, Commuters, and
the Panthers. The eager incoming
frosh are Well represented by the
Annex, Thurlow Hall, Van Derzee,
and Red Raider teams.

Potter Suffers Heavy Loss

It is difficult at this time to make
any predictions, but from past years
you can bet that both the finalists
from last year will be well up in
the standings. Potter Club defeated
KDR for the championship last
year. Potter Club lost three of their
first string ends from last year‘s
undefeated and unsccred upon ag-
gregation. Hard running Bob Eich
has entered Pennsylvania U., end
Jack Marks has left college. and
passer Jim Warden has gone out
for the Varsity soccer team. Capt.
Paul Carter will not find it easy
to fill these gaping holes. Veterans
returning to his team besides Paul
will be Harv Clearwater, Ed White.
Ken Ludlum, “Killer” Kaehn. and
Joe Persico.

The only loss suffered by the
runner-up KDR outfit was Dave
Durkee, regarded by many as one
of the best ends in the league. Re—
turning to bolster the KDR team
will be Jerry Brophy, Bill Wiley,
Bill Dunn, Bob Hausner, Al Ste-
venson, and posibly Jerry Dunn.
Power of Fresh is Unknown

Not to be overlooked will be the
new frosh teams. There are some
big boys in the class of ‘54. The
Gents and the Angels will also
present a threat to last year‘s tit—
lists.

The whistle tooters this year will
be drawn from the competing
teams of the opposite league and
from Coach Hathaway's officiating
class. Failure to perform assigned
officiating duties twice will call for
immediate elimination from the
league of the offending team.

League Manager Huusncr would
like if. to be known that Varsity
soccer candidates are ineligible for
Intro-mural football. Other stud—
cnls are permitted to play Intra-
mural soccer as well as touch fool-
ball.
