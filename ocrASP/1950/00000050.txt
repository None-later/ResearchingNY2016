Herr Rosenbaum ’54, who will tu-
tor any interested State Fraulein or

Kurt Rosenbaum, a three year
native of Prattsville, New York. was
born in the Ruhr valley. His major
boyhood event was attending the
International Boy Scout Jamboree
in Holland in 1926.

In 1942 he found himself jammed
into a concentration camp. Three
years later he managed to escape.
“After all," he says with his char-
acteristic sense of humor, “three
years in a concentration camp can
get awfully dull. The same food. the
same i'ecreation——~.”

After working two years in a DP
camp. Kurt came to the United
States and got his impression of
New York in hot July. “I didn't like
it so I left and found a job as a
beef-boner." Translated this means
butcher. In Prattsville he continued
his interrupted education. success-
fully passed the regents and receiv-
ed his high school diploma.

Kurt Rosenbaum is a man with
determination. He wants to teach,
here. in the United States. He has
seen what happens when an educa-
tion system gets into a dictator’s
hands. and he doesn‘t want to see
it happen again. “I want to show
my students the importance of the
American way of life."

But Kurt realizes that he still has
much to learn about this American
way of life. The other day he went
to buy some eggs. “Have you exks?"
he asked the clerk. “With or with-
out a handle?" inquired the clerk.
“With.” said Kurt. thinking the
United States had developed a new
type of egg. Imagine his surprise
when the clerk came back carrying
a long-handled axe!

For Gala Occasion

Anyone want to shake the
hand that shook the hand that
shook the hand of President

ran wild among the frosh after
last Friday night's President’s
Reception.

No doubt impressed. or per-
haps amazed. at the sophistica—
tion and formality of the aﬂair.
the finery these freshmen sport-
ed was no less impressive.
Feathered hats. swishing dress-
es. spike heels and spiked toes.
stiff collars and stiffer arms
seem to have been the fashion
of the evening. While big sisters
and brothers searched for some-
one to introduce their charges
to. the frosh made themselves
known to faculty and students.
It is rumored that one Miss
found herself being shown
around by her little sis!

Well. back to the moth balls
with the glad rags. kids. It's

D&A To Show
Film, [The Titan,’
Tuesday Evening

“The Titan" is coming to State
Tuesday at 8 pm. in Page Hall. ac-
cording to Martha Downey '51.
President of Dramatics and Arts
Council.

This ﬁlm. narrated by Frederic
March. will relate the major events
of Michelangelo's life and their in-
fluence on his creations.

 

“The Titan" is principally a de-
tailed pictorial examination of all
Michelangelo's main works. It con-
tains no living actors. The sounds
and scenes are there. but the peo-
ple are absent. The picture is thus
filmed so as not to detract from the
beauty of the works themselves.
Background material is introduced
only when necessary to illustrate
the motivation of the artist's work.

During the course of the movie
Michelangelo's creations are shown
in their various stages of comple-
tion from start to finish. Sculptures.
paintings from the Sistine Chapel.
including both the ceiling and the
Last. Judgment. are shown in de-
tail as well as in over-all views.

“The Titan." a new kind of film
brings the art ﬁlm to a higher level.
