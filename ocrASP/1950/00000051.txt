ICA Con Mean . . .

Nominations will be taken from the student
body today in assembly for delegates to ICA con-
ference. Inter-Collegiate Association Conference
will be held at Fredonia State Teachers College
November 10 and 11.

This will be one in a series of conferences in
which State College representatives have been ac-
tive. At these meetings our delegates have discus-
sed problems directly related to Teacher colleges
and students. They have compared notes on col-
lege traditions, insignia, rings, and publications.

Last year our representatives were especially
satisfied with the results of the meetings. They
returned to Albany with reports about student
unions, class rings, co-ops, cafeterias, constitu-
tions, budgets, and handbooks. The News printed
their complete reports. One idea gained at the
conference which lead to direct action was the
adoption of a soft covered Handbook.

“State Supported Athletic Programs,” “Park-
ing Situations,” “Ordering Textbooks,” and “In-
tercultural Relations” are some of the topics on
the suggested agenda for the conference in No-
vember.

ICA is not very old and hasn’t yet shown its
full capacities. It can be a powerful group if we
back it. Our four candidates can be leaders in
making it a truly effective organization.

Be Active . . .

Tomorrow rivalry begins, the Seniors put their
banner on the wall, the Juniors present the frosh.
with their banner and the freshmen sign for par-
ticipation in organizations.

If some frosh are tempted to sign for more or—
ganizations than they can participate in, it won’t
be surprising. Over twenty organizations will at—
tempt to persuade freshmen to join their ranks.
Enthusiasm for this day in the past seems to have
been evident on the part of the freshmen but up-
perclassmen have been too busy or just disinter-
ested.

It would be a more pleasant experience tomor-
row for ’54 if a large group of Seniors, Juniors
and Sophs were present to show that we here do
have a definite feeling of loyalty for our school.

More Service . . .

Red Cross is coming to our campus. Grey lad-
ies, swimming classes, nurses' aides, first aid . . .
Mrs. Hubbel is going to give the college slant on
the Red Cross Program today in assembly.

Ten persons are needed to form each class. The
instructors will be trained teachers from the lo-
cal Red Cross Unit. .

At times it seems that there are tnorc serv1ce
organizations than there are causes to serve. Red
Cross is one of those with many causes which it
does serve. From serving doughnuts to 01’s in
train stations to helping a man with a family
ruined by a flood, Red Cross has done material
service.

For students who are interested in a service
work and not already too occupied, this group
offers experiences which may be valuable later in
teaching.

By PAUL

There comes a time in every man’s
life when he must turn in his
Crawlalong Cavendish Sheriff's
Badge for a shoulder patch, park
his six-shooter at the door and pick
up a Cold 45, and exchange his
spurs for a pair of combat boots.

After all, since June 2th, so the re-‘

port goes, more kindergarten girls
are switching to Eisenhower Jackets
than ever before.

I was exempt. I was, that is, until

am“

To the Editor:

To clarify the purpose of the Stu-
dent-Faculty committee in its at-
tempt to work on the Social Calen-
dar, I would like to set forth our
aims. and why we have undertaken
this.

Firstly, most of the dates which
were previously arranged will still
stand, and only where two major
events conflict, do changes appear
necessary.

For the past two or three years,
as the school enrollment increases,
the problem of finding weekend
dates available for social functions
has grown in complexity. While the
number of requests has multiplied,
the number of available weekends
has remained constant.

To attempt to alleviate this sit-
uation, one of two things seems
necessary—either the calendar has
to be planned with more care, or
groups have to curtail their social
activities. To most people, the for-
mer seems preferable. To obtain
this however, more activities have
to be planned for the same date,
and, in so far as possible, they
should not conflict with each other.
One good example of this is to
plan all class banquets for the same
night. Also, why couldn‘t fraterni-
ties plan stag rush parties for an
evening when the sororities are
having open houses for freshmen
girls?

The aim of the committee is to
act as a “clearing house” for this
purpose.

For the immediate problem, sev-
eral organizations have been asked
to either reschedule events slated
for October, or to hold them in con—
flict with another event. This
seemed the more advisable plan,
rather than to rush the general
meeting so that organizations would
not be able to hold a meeting prior
to this meeting.

We hope that, for the months
after October at least, the calen—
dar will be more stable, and each
group will be able to hold all its
social functions without conflicts
with some parallel group.

E. KIRSCH

Local Draft Board No. 2 checked
through its “dead or missing" ﬂle
Since 1948, when I had registered, I
had been in constant lock of touch
with my Board. I thought I was
one of those lucky few who are for-
gotten until some public minded
citizen writes an anonymous letter
to Senator Kefauver saying, "Why
isn’t he in uniform." Since I never
found the traitor, and there being
no logical answer to the query, I
was in.

I guess the mailman didn't be-
lieve the “Beware of the mad dog
notice” sign, and, as his weary foot-
steps faded into noise of the Bronx,
an anguished wail tore through the
house. Yes, Ma. your son is on the
verge of trading in his pair of jeans
for a pair of Uncle Sam’s.

We were tempted to reject this
offer of steady employment by
checking one of the boxes on the
envelope: the one marked “refused”
a penalty for private use of govern-
mental envelopes, so we were forced
to open it.

Ah, yes, the questionnaire. Even
an idiot could (and should) have
replaced the originator of those
questions. One set goes on like this:
Answer the ﬁrst four questions.
answer the fifth if you have an-
swered the ﬁrst two “yes” and the
fourth “no.” (They don’t care how
you answer the third.)

Then they ask, “Where were you
born?" You say, "The United
States.” Does that make you a citi—
zen? No! For the next question,
which you must answer, asks, "Have
you taken out your citizenship pa—
pers?" You should answer this
“No.” But that makes you an alien.
If you answer, "Yes," you’re giving
false information. You're trapped!

Having wasted all of ten days be—
fore returning the letter, you en-
close a poignant speech on the sub-
ject: “Why I should be deferred be-
cause of my school status.” This is
the time to make believe that you
are patriotic, but that you had
things planned a little differently.

I did that too. Only they sent me
an insistent note requesting that
the Dean of my school send them
a copy of my school standing. At
this point I began to worry. What
if the Dean didn’t think I was do-
ing as well as I did? In that case
I could only escape the draft by
enlisting. A capital idea, but one
worthy of rejection.

Between the time I received the
letter and mailed it to my Board,
that I could be taken right out of
school and trans-shipped to Korea.
I laughingly cast aside their kind
words of encouragement and waited.

Now I am SS No. 50-24-29-421,
with my classiﬁcation so high that
I'll receive, instead of a diploma, 3.
message of “Greetings.”

still and move the brush"

The Common-Stator is given the widest latitude as
author of this column, although his viewpoints do
not necessarily reflect those of the STA“ Comma:
News.

THE GUV’NER . . .

WE DON’T think we can say too much about "His
Excellency’s" visit to State; we feel that he spoke
for himself . . . and quite well . . even if his
audience did consist mostly of blue beanies and
Milne students . . . the Boul must have done quite
a business during that period . . . ain't it nice, though,
to be such a “select group.”

IRATE READER . . .

Seems as thought a member of the Co-op staff was
annoyed at our suggestion last week to return to
’49’s book-selling system . . . and rightly so . . . last
year the Co-op lost a good sum of money when our
“future teachers of America” started walking off with
the books.

ACTIVITIES DAY . . .

By now you freshmen have had an opportunity
to become acquainted with State and the wide pro-
gram of extra-curricula activities it has to offer . . .
tomorrow you have the chance to show your inter—
ests . . . we urge you. however, to sign up wisely . . .
remember, a professional joiner is of no value to
himself or the organizations he joins.

JUST TO MENTION . . .

The fine publicity job done by D and A for “The
Titan" . . . let's hope the picture lives up to the
posters . . . The uniting of the language clubs in
spite of overwhelming language barriers . . . keep up
the good work. kids! . . . The efficiency with which
the maintenance men prepared the campus for Gov—
ernor Dewey‘s visit . . . The new ping pong table for
the athletically inclined . . . The distribution map

in upper Draper . . . mystery of the week . . . who's
the lonely soul from Wyoming county? . . . The
turnout at last Friday’s soccer game . . . it was pret-
ty good.

SHADES 0F RIVALRY . . .
With Activities Day rivalry is officially started
. ‘54 will receive its banner, the symbol of its
class. and from here on in, the fight will be on.
Up to now we haven't sensed too much inter-class
spirit between the blue jays and the red devils.
but we hope the excitement of this Saturday’s events
will set them off . . . a word of advice. however, the
hunt is on . . . let‘s not have it called off again

because of a stolen banner.

AN INTERESTED SPECTATOR . . .

If you want to know anything about what’s going
on at; State. just ask “Louis of the Boul" . . . we had
a little chat with him the other day and though
inclined to pat himself on the back a bit, he came
up with the following: he'll reduce the ten-cent mi-
nimum when the 17.50 fee is reduced . . . neither
the cafeteria nor the Waldorf bother him much

. . the former’s crummy sandwiches made up at
eight and the latter being out of his class, give
him quite a feeling of confidence. Where else. sez
Louie could fifty girls come in, buy one bottle
of soda, ask for twenty-five glasses. park for the
afternoon, mess up the tables, and then move on to
greener pastures . . . taking with them sugar, cof-
fee cups. {1 complete setting of their favorite silver
pattern .. . those bars aren't on the window for at-
mosphere kiddies.

PEI) BLUES . . .

What happens to those people who don't have two
bucks for a new Ped picture . . . or who think that
last year’s picture makes them look very dashing
. . . guess they become camera shy.

HOLY COW ! i i

The announcement that girls shouldn’t use the
dorm field on “the Sabbath" is one of the most nar-
row blue laws we have ever heard. What‘s irt‘eiiglous
about communing with nature?

PERSONAL TO UNCLE MILTIE . . .

You've had quite a time greeting the freshmen
since we've been here. We hope you don‘t feel too
blue in assembly this afternoon.

Houdini Performs
Miracle At Potter

Abracadale And right be-
fore your eyes the Potter house
is transformed into a colorful
domicile for its Greek brothers.
Of course. the boys did have
something to do with this mir-
twle, too.

Dunning dungarees and with
brush in hand, they scaled the
ladders to give the walls that
“new” look.” As if taking the
colors from the rainbow, the
EEPS varied the points in
each room. Amidst the tan,
green, blue, and pink walls
the newly waxed ﬂoors, one
stands absolutely awed at the
grand job the boys have done.

While the braver boys mount-
ed the house to repair the aging
roof, the more skillful lads will
have a chance to show their tal-
ent when they install sltowers
on the third floor in the near
future. Yes sir! The magician
sure did turn in a. super-special
performance at Potter Club.
