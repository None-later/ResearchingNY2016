Easy Triumphs
For KDR, Finks

The Finks gave indication Tues-
day afternoon on the Page Hall
Field that they will be one of the
main contenders for the Page
League Crown. Featuring the pass-
ing of Ray Champlln. the Finks ran
rough-shod over the hapless Com-
muters. Champlin completed three
touchdown passes to end Tom Yole,
another bright spot in the Fink
picture, and one to Al Kaehn. The
one touchdown that the Finks
scored via the ground route was on
a right end sweep by Champlin.

It seems that the Finks need a
little polishing up on their extra
point tries. They made only one out
of five tries and that one was
Kaehn.

KDR Overpowers VDZ

Following the Finks 31-0 conquest
of the Commuters. the highly rated
KDR aggregation swamped the Van
Derzee team by a 29-0 count.

0n the kick-off. Wiley of KDR
returned the ball to about the mid-
field stripe. Gorman raced 14 yards
on the ﬁrst play from the scrim-
mage with Hausner on the next
play bucking for the first down.
Here Van Derzee's defense stiffened
and forced an exchange of punts.
On an attempted forward pass.
Gormna intercepted for KDR and
brought it back to mid-field. From
this point KDR scored in just three
plays—41 pass from Hausner to Gor-
man good for 18 yards, a run by
Gorman intercepted for KDR and
quarterback sneak by Huusner. The
extra point was tallied on a pass
from Hausner to Wiley.

Wiley Scores As llalf Ends

KDR scored on a pass from Haus-
ncr to Wiley as the ﬁrst half drew
to a close.

The score began to mount as Gor-
man heaved a long pass to Ted
Pcene. The extra point was made
on a Hausner to Smith pass. After
KDR‘s kick-off. Van Derzec was
thrown back for a safety when an
attempted pass was blocked and
rolled into the end zone.

The ﬁnal TD came when Hausner
connected on a 25-yard pass to
Dave Palmer. Hausner added the
extra point on a left end run.

Thurlow Downs KB

With George Schaertlc and Joe

from Thurlow Hull brought victory
in their dorm in Monday's lcag'uc

Thurlow, undcr acting captain

Angels Roll Up
33-0 Victory

The St. Mary’s Angels rolled over
a comparatively inexperienced An-
nex team 33-0 for their first win
of the season. The Angels served
notice to other league members that
they have a vaunted aerial attick
to go with their steady ground
game.

The game wasn't two minutes old
before the Angels had their initial
score. They kicked off to the An-
nex and three plays later Bob Brown
intercepted a pass and returned it
to the mid—field stripe. After two
incomplete passes, Mike Biloz hit
Brown with a TD pass and the An-
gels were off to the races. Shortly
thereafter the victors moved 45
yards to another six-pointer. Ed
Adamo scoring on a 10 yd. pass
from Biloz. The same combination
added the extra-point and the first
quarter ended with the Angels lead-
ing 13-0.

Biloz and Hawkins Pace Attack

In the second period, the Angel
team took to the air for another
TD. Biloz throwing to Pete Hawk—
ins for 28 yds. This duo also added
the extra point. Going to a ground
game fo'~ the remainder of the half,
the St. Mary team moved to the
Annex 5 only to have the clock run
out .

Two plays after the second half
kickoff the Angels team had their
fourth score with Mike Biloz heav-
ing his fourth consecutive touch—
down pass. His target was once
again Bob Brown. Mike passed to
Herb Egcrt for the extra point and
the Angels led 27-0. Aftcr the en—
suing kickoff, the Annex showed
their first ability to move, but a
15 yard penalty nullified their ef—
forts and they were forced to kick.
The Angels fumbled away another
chance to score early in the last
period and the Annex started their
biggest push of the day. moving to
the Angel 10. Here an interception
halted their drive. The last score
of this Donnybrook came on a 50
yd. toss. Bob Brown to Don Burns.
Biloz Completes 13 Passes

Doug Nielson played outstanding
football for the losers. The Angel
team cleared the bench early in
the game and all of the St. Mary's
crew handled themselves well. Mike
Biioz completed 13 out of 20 passes
and Bob Brown had his hand in
three of the winner‘s scores to set
the offensive pace of the game.
Hurry Johnson and newcomers Dick
Eckstrum and Pete Hawkins looked
very good on the defense for the

Angels.

irst Victory

Brockport Eagles
Defeat Statesmen
In Opener; 4-0

A hard fighting State College
soccer team went down to defeat
before the powerful onslaught of a
star studded Brockport eleven on
last Friday at Beverwyck Park by
the score of 4 to 0.

.Coach Garcia hopes to win his
first game as State’s soccer coach
tomorrow when the booters travel
to Plattsburg to meet Plattsburg
tState. Nineteen men will make the
‘ rip.

' The score of the game was no
lllulCdCiUll of the relative strength
or either team. Brockport had a
oeciueo edge because of practice
and also because of experience.
Brockport scored its first goal after
ten minutes and seventeen seconds
of the first quarter had been played.
'lhe Eagles were unable to pene-
trate State's defense for another
scoie until 11 minutes and 13 sec-
onus of the third quarter had elap-
sed. Brockport got' two goals in
quick succussion in this quarter and
added another goal in the fourth
quarter.

In the first quarter, Brockport
socied when Kolaki headed the ball
beautifully to Kink who immediate-
ly booted the ball to Johnson. John-
son passed the ball to Orbaker and
scored when Orbaker passed back
to him.

State Penalty Costly

in the third quarter State was
penalized for using hands, Thomp-
son tried a. penality kick which was
blocked by Taylor but Johnson was
on the spot and managed to boot
the ball through. Pascal also scored
for the Eagles almost immediately
after Johnson had scored. Pascal
scored when Washburn booted the
ball down the right side to John-
son. Johnson drew State’s goalie out
of position and then passed into
Pascal who scored easily.

McAllister scored in the fourth
quarter when State was again pen—
alized for using hands. This ended
the scoring for the day although
State threatened three times after
thetiast goal was scored by Brock-
por .

Taylor Stars as Goalie

Dave Weather-by, Dean Strickland,
Raoul Nunez. and Jim Warden
played exceptionally good ball for
Stale both on offense and defense.
Every man on the team played
heads up ball but these four men
were outstanding. The whole team
showed plenty of scrap and fight
right down to the final whistle.
Bill Taylor. substituting for the in-
jured Arnie Dansky, turned in an
excellent job as goalie. He made
right saves for State and two of
the goals that were scored against
him were the result of penalty
kicks.

Condition and the fact that
Brockport had an All-American
goulic—numed Bondi were the con-
tributing factors in the Brockport
victory. Bondi, the Eagles Goalie.
made nine saves and played out-
standing bull.
