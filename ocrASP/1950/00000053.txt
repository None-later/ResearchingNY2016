an article called “Do You KnoW?",
in which was related “that it is cus-
tomary for freshmen to remain in
student assembly, chapel, and all
student gatherings until all ripper-
classmen are out of the auditorium.
Also brought to the attention of
the News was the following: “That

in history. Quiz sections are double

Dr. Vickery then pointed out that
the purpose of this meeting was to
express ideas not to echo them. The
members present then gave their
ideas as to What the Center should

objectives. aims and purposes of the

Asked what interesting things she
had noted about Japan's educational
standards as compared with those

of whom were educated in Germany
and who are dedicated to the Ger—
