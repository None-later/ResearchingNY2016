cil. The topic for debate will be
Resolved: “That the Non-Commun-
ist nations of the world form a new

French, Spanish Club Meetings
Will Feature Singing, Dancing

Two departmental clubs have
scheduled meetings to be held Wed-
nesday and Thursday. French Club
will meet Wednesday in the Lounge
at 4:30 pm, and Pan Amigos will
meet Thursday at 8 pm. in the
Commons. according to William
Kll‘milll ‘52, and Lillian Olsen ’51.
respective Presidents of the clubs.

At both club meetings there will
be singing. refreshments and conver-
sations in the respective languages.

What? Has State suddenly revers-
ed its rules? 80 they say. Just for
the annual Commuters’ Club Soc
Hop to be held Friday, October 27.

The student body will parade
around in plaid shirts, blue jeans
and other old looking glad rags.
Looks like dress clothes are really
on the way out and shoes are no
longer a necessity. From 8 to 12
pm. the gym will resound with the
sock steps of round, square and
folk dancing.

Everyone has been planning all
week about the socks they plan to
wear. Your girl might even ﬁnish up
those argyles she’s knitting if you
begged her. Being able to wear jeans
and shirts sure solves the clothes
problem and leaves plenty of spare
moments to choose from your ex-
tensive ??? sock wardrobe.

Through the maze of people and
their fashionable feet you may
glance around and appreciate the
calm, quiet eﬁ’ect of the yellow and
black decorations. Is that part of
the decorations or could that seedy
looking character be a friend of
yours? The corn stalks and wither-
ed leaves nevertheless will remind
the country kids of home and gives
the city slickers a chance to ex-
perience a night down on the farm.
Just picture your partner as Bessie
and your best friend as Horace and
the scene will be complete.

After the ﬁrst set of square dances
there will be a mad dash for the
cider (sweet, of course) and those
holey donuts.

Now fellows and gals, this is your
chance

Femmes, Cowhonds
Invade iGC Dance

“Swing your partner, and
do-si-do to your corner gal,
and swing her round again." The
good ole square dance was back
at State again at the IGC Mas-
querade Bull, and all those pres-
ent (with the boys in majority
for once) are sure to remember
the grand time they had.

In the very gully decorated
Commons, Roman slaves danced
among African pirates, while
Japanese geisha girls and
French “i‘emmes” found Texan
cowhnnds as partners for the
various squares. For that mo-
ment of refreshment there was
cider and a variety of pastry
appropriate for the interna-
tional setting.

The Grand Marco also made
quite a hit, since prizes were
then awarded to 11 few of the
masqueraders. Surely the organ
grinder and his little money
(poor girl) deserved the prize
for the most unusually dressed.
Students will probably be happy
to have another such affair in
the near future, n'cst—cc pas?
