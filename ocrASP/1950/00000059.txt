STATE COLLEGE NEWS.

If you think that only experi-
ments in a chem or physics lab are
exciting, it’s because you’re a preju-
diced old science major. The AD.
lab plays last Tuesday night are
proof aplenty that mixing all the
ingredients of dramatic production
—especially when done by neophytes
—can be fascinating and hazardous.
An inexperienced chemist, it’s true,
may blow his head off. But it’s the
AD. student who stands the chance
of having his heart knocked out.

Fortunately, nothing of the sort
happened at this year’s opening
night. The only violence noticeable
was that several members of the
audience nearly split their sides
laughing at Sue Danzis’ offering.
And with good reason. We didn’t
get much of the original, but what
we got was funny.

Furthermore, we had a cast that
could deliver the lines as they need-
ed to be delivered. Ross Federico’s
gift for timing is no less valuable
than his ability to look lost, ludic-
rous, and leacherous, yet likeable
withal. We hope Ross appreciates
his talent as much as his audience
did. Don Collins, newcomer Louis
Vion, and Bob Donnelly—the latter
struggling with that actor’s curse,
an Irish brogue-gave the proper
atmosphere to the hotel headquar-
ters of the party you could love and
admire, but not trust. Not the least
of the play's delights was Pat Graff
as chambermaid. We're glad she
doesn’t walk and talk like that
around school. but on a stage it's
nothing short of terrific. Don Put-
terman, apparently attempting to
avoid the usual shrewd, brash news—
paper-man, might have been better
off giving us the stereotype.

Opening the evening was a sus-
penseful melodrama with mood well-
sustained by lighting effects-wan-
dle as well as electric. Henry Smith
also managed to endow his play
with a sense of looming doom. Even
the invisible, irresistable force which
drew the men from the room was

 

Gals Visit America
In 'Greek' Spacer

“Everyone wearing plaid skirts
leave the dance floor” and on
with the Inter-Sorority Social.
Under the bright colored
streamers danced the trash girls
with sorority members. Sorry.
follows, this was one of those
“musts” to which the gals could
not bring their beitux.

As the evening danced away,
in trotted ColumbUS. We settled
down for it long trip to America
in a space ship and enjoyed the
patterns of the various eras——
Dutch cloppcrs, high hats, flap—
pcrs, etc. Now, we're all “brush-
lng our teeth with Pepsodent
and washing our hair with
l)rcnc."

As we were exhausted from
the “nlcmande left. alemimde
right." everyone dashed for a hit
of refreshments but there was
no rest for the weary in that
long line.

As we headed for home with
our souvenirs. we thought of a
lull evening of new friends and
new bruises.

well conveyed. The frequent mo-
ments of complete silence which
fell over the audience should be ex-
tremely gratifying to Mr. Smith.
The only defect of much moment
was the ambulating idol—and we’re
ready to admit “it” would have giv-
en an expert trouble.

Marv Poons’ cockney accent was
just fine, as were his simulations of
hysteria toward the end. Ed Kyle
didn’t quite pull off his Mr. Belve-
dere-turned-evil assignment. He was
sufﬁciently smooth and “superior,”
but we didn’t get the savage con-
tempt the man obviously had for his
companions.

Sure, there were imperfections:
both plays suffered moments of in-
ept staging, Weakened mood, faulty
cueing and the like. But by and
large the whole evening was in tune
with the high-spirited and ingrati-
atingly novel music and fanfare Miss
Danzis whipped up for her produc-
tion. We can hardly wait for next
Tuesday night.

Compile Results Of College Survey;
Women Get More Sleep Than Men

Are women more energetic than
men? Do they spend more time on
personal care? These and other
questions have been answered at
len~-,t fcntnfivcly as far as forty-four
State students are concerned. The
following data has been compiled

from reports made by eighteen
women and twenty-six men, in

health classes. as to the way they
claim to have actually spent their
time during one day.

As rumored. women do get more
bcznity sleep than men. but only 18
minutcs more. The women's high
and low cases for time spent in sleep
were nine, hours and six hours and

were nine hours and 43 minutes and
five hours and 25 minutes. On body

average of one hour and 22 minutes
and the corresponding average for
men is a mere 52 minutes. One
speedy male spends only 26 minutes

Contrary to common opinion. men.
at least those in this group, do not
gulp down their food. In fact, they
average three minutes more a day

rccrciition the women outdo the men
by 20 minutcs, but they concede to
thc men by four minutes in indivi-
dunl recreation. Vigorous physical

Elements Oi Design

The Art Department has display—
ed a. new series of pictures dealing
with Modern Art, according to Ruth
Hutchins. Assistant Professor of Art.
A new experiment is being carried
on to show certain fundamental
principles which are used in all
ﬁelds of design.

The photos for the exhibit were
taken from the Museum of Modern
Art in New York City. Any future
teachers who are interested in ob-
may obtain
them from the publisher.

The display deals primarily with
the similarity between art llllCl ev-

worker and the designer uses these
with his tools and materials. The
images of design vary with each

Last week in assembly the stu-
dents showed they can have the
spirit a winning team needs. They
snowed. that we aren‘t dead. But
when the students left their seats i
guess they left their spirit, except
for the few uiehards who turned up
to watch the hooters win their
fourth straight. Let's make it five
at the expense of Siena next week
boys—you’ve shown you can do it.
1 was told that if we wanted to get
a crowd at the soccer games we
s..ould assrgn assembly seats for
Beverwyck and have Mary Borys
lead the students up there. She could
do it too.

 

r or the past several years the
members of me varsity baSKetball
team wow the victims of poor

scheduling and couldn't attend the
Christmas borinal. ’lnis year it was
not gomg to happen. No longer
would Elie feimai take place on the
same night as an away game. This
year it will be held on the same
night as a home game. Tradition has
been broken! Now not only the play-
ers but the cheerleaders. managers,
etc, and loyal fans won't be able to
attend the dance. Why? That's
easy to aiisw‘cr. The reason why
State kids have to suffer is because
there are seine students here on
campus who go with out-of-town
boys and follows from other col-
leges, and of course they must come
before State students. The Junior
Prom last year was held on a Friday
night and the dance was a success.
Why can't the Christmas formal be
held on a Friday night so the bas-
ketball team can come too. Some
members of the team haven't been
able to attend the big dance since
tney were freshan and now that
they’re Seniors they once again will
lose their chalice because of some
boys from RPI, Siena, Union. and
other colleges. It's not too late to
change the date of the dance. If the
dance was scheduled last year the
basketball schedule could have been
fixed, but because of ll lack of a
firm stand on lhc part of someone
the date of thc dance and a place
to hold the dance wasn‘t fixed until
the beginning of this minth. If the
committee who has the final say on
the dance, has any school spirit, I
think a solution can be made. How
about a meeting today to straighten
this mess up?

In case you didn't read last week's
column —- (‘oach Garcia wants all
men who are interested in forming
it wrestling club to see him today or
early next week. Sometime next
week the first meeting will be held
and at this meeting it will be. de-
cided as to when practices will be
held. Let's have ii good turnout.
Look what Garcia did for soccer. An
interesting fact is that (‘oucli Gar—
cia has several of his pictures in the
Collegiate wrestling book showing
different wrestling holds. He was
picked to pose for these shots be-
cause he was the outstanding wrest-
ler in the Midwest for several years.

Keg'e" Sweep State Wins Fourth Straight;
Play Sparks Team

To Easy Victory
Over Pharmacy

Wednesday night at the Siena
alleys, the State Bowling team
romped to three straight wins over
Albany Pharmacy. Three men on
State’s team rolled a better than 500
three game total with Don Burt's
546 leading the team.

The tirst game saw Burt. Corsi
and McDonald bowl over 200 to lead
our keglers to a lopsided victory
with a margin of 203 pins.

Burt continued to blaze the al-
leys by rolling another 200 game and
to help the team take this game
by a total of 236 pins.

In the third game McDonald and
Cassetta carried the burden as the
statesmen made it a clean sweep
for the evening. The last game was
the closest of the evening, but State
won easily with 78 pins to spare
and proved beyond doubt that State
had the superior team.

State’s total of 904 pins for their
first game is the highest they have
reached this year and it may re-
main the top score since three 200
scores in one game is not an every—
day occurence.

New additions to this year’s squad
include Corsi. Cassetta and Sinkle-
dam. They are all Sophomores and
should keep State up near the top
for quite a while.

his previous performance, took a 15
yard pass from Lewis and raced 30
yards for the first score. A good
kickoff put Potter on its 15 but be-
hind the devastating blocks of La-
Manna. Carter ran all the way to
knot the score. Just before the end
of the quarter Carter scored again
on a 20 yard flip from Tauroney.

The Annex handed Potter its next
score as it took over at midfield and
3 plays later lost the ball on its 1
yard line when Ludlein fell on a
fumble. Tauroney then scored on
the next play.

In the second half the Annex of-
fensive switched to a split forma-
tion with both ends and halfs play-
ing wide. This formation was very
effective for short passing, but when
long passes were attempted they
wcie either intercepted or the pass-
er was thrown for a loss. Lewis com-
pleted 4 in a row before the Potter
defense was able to intercept a pass
intended for Rous. Potter then be-
gun to roll and the payoff came
four plays later as Carter passed to
Tauroney from 25 yards out. For
the remainder of the quarter, play
remained at midfield. As the last
period began. Potter who was deter-
mined to score a point after touch-
down. scored as Carter ran around
the Annex right end from the five
yard line. The extra point was good
on a pass. Carter to Mathews.

The most outstanding feature of
the Potter attack was the line
blof'klllu givcn both the passer and
the runners.

Bullock, Nunez,
Weatherby Star,-
Siena ls Next

Coach Joe Garcia’s men annexed
their fourth straight victory of the
1950 soccer season by whipping a
hard fighting A.B.C. team 4-1, at
Beverwyck Park on Wednesday.

The Feds face perhaps their
toughest game of the current season
next Friday when they play the
Siena Indians at Beverwyck Park.
The Statesmen took the first tilt of
this home and home series by the
score of 1—0. Siena was beaten last
week by the Oswego team and they
got their first goal against them and
rumor has it that they are out to
stop the winning streak of Coach
Garcia's boys. The soccer season is
fast drawing to a close so let‘s get
out there next Friday and show the
team that we really appreciate the

type of ball they're playing this
year.

McCormick Scores First

The State College soccer team

made it four straight Wednesday by
downing a scrappy and much im-
proved A.B.C. squad by the score
of 4-1. Bill McCormick drew first
blood for the Statesmen by making
a beautiful head shot with 17 min—
utes and 30 seconds of the first
quartcr gone. The Feds had the ball
on A.B.C.'s half of the field for most
of the quarter but were unable to
get the ball into pay dirt.

State scoreil early in the second
quarter when McCormick crossed
the ball from deep in the left cor-
ner and Tom King blasted it
through. Dean Strickland. who had
been injured in the first quarter.
was back in the game and scored
the third goal for the Feds on a
beautiful boot from about 12 yards
out. This goal was scored with 21
minutes of the second quarter gone.

Neither team was able to push a
goal across in the third quarter. Bob
Mazzo, scrappy outside right. from
ABC. was ejected from the game
with seven minutes of the third
quarter gone for vociferously disput-
ing a decision of the referee. No
substitution is allowed for a case
such as this and so the boys from
Business were forced to finish the
game with on.y 10 players.

11.5.0. Finally Scores

The fourfh quarter started off
very much like the third with each
team playing good defensive ball.
Tony Tafur scored the lone A.B.C.
tally after 15 minutes of the fourth
quarter had elapsed on a penalty
kick. The Garcia men bounced right
back with Nunez driving the ball
through from 20 yards out on a
beautiful kick that went way in the
upper right hand corner of the goal.
This goal came with sixteen infli-
ufcs of the fourth quarter gone and
ended the scoring for the clay.
