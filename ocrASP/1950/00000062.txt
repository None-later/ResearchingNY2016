KB Deieats KDR, 7-0;

Fallek Sets Up Score

Defensive Play
Highlights Game

Last Friday afternoon the Intra-
mural Football League experienced
its first major upset of the year as
an inspired KB team defeated KDR.
7-0. The game was the most vicious
played thus far. Bruising blocks and
hard running featured the offenses
of both clubs. During the first half.
both teams punched their way to
within the opponents“ ten-yard line
several times; but both teams lacked
that final touchdown drive and the
half ended scoreless.

KB moved deep into KDR terri-
tory in the third period but once
again the defenders staved off the
scoring thrust. After moving the
ball to midfield on runs by Smith
and German. KDR's Bill Wiley took
to the air and Max Fallek intercept-
ed his first toss and returned to
the 8-yard line. After two thrusts
at the line. Abel Blattmaii followed
Don Cohen and Gerald Friedholz
around his own right end for the
game’s only score. Blattman passed
to Fallek for the extra point.

KDR Rallies

The KDR team rallied strongly
but the KB defense led by Mort
Frank cut off their last period rush
as German's fourth down paSs fell
incomplete in the end zone. The
victors took over and ran the clock
out on a series of line smashes.

Both these teams must face the
undefeated Finks and if KDR has
ally hope of retaining the Page Lea-
gue Championship they must do—
feat the F‘inks in their game which
is to be played on Page field today.
A victory today would assure eithe:
of these teams of at least ii tie for
the league crown.

tory in 11 contest marked not only
by hard blocking but by flying fists.
This puss came midway in the sec-
ond quarter and caught the Thur-
low safety off guard. Several times
earlier in the game this long pass
play was tried but each time. the
play was broken up; however when
Thuriow relaxer] for a minute the
Finks capitalized on the. break.

The game was far from ended at
this point~ us the game went into

would have tied the game. Outside
of the touchdown score. the Finks
weren‘t able to advance for against

Angels Rout Jets,-
Air Offensive

__ Aids Triumph

Mike Biloz once more took the
Angels to victory on the strength of
his right arm as he completed 19 out
of 30 passes. He tossed five TDP's
and scored another touchdown on a
9-yard buck to pace the St. Mary's
men to their third straight win, a
39-6 victory over the Jets.

The Jets rocked the Angels with
a quick TD as Duffus romped 23
yards "untouched" through the en-
tire Angel team with the game only
one minute old. Smith was smoth~
ered on the extra point try. The
losers completely outplayed their
opponents in the first period as
they blocked an Angel punt and re-
covered on the ll-yard line. The
crew from St. Mary's bolstered their
defenses at this point and yielded
only 3 yards in four plays. The Jets
held a 6-0 lead at the end of the first
quarter.

Angels Take To Air

’lhe Angels then took over and
Biloz completed four out of five
passes to move the length of the
fielcl. The pay-off play was a six—
yardcr to Don Burns. Just before
the. half ended a pass. Biloz to
Johnson. set the stage for another
TDP with Burns on the receiving
end again. Hawkins scored the extra
point. putting the Angels on top
13-6 at the half.

The game turned into a rout as
the Angel air offensive got deadlier.
Biloz hit Ed Adamo and Art Batty
with touchdown flings in the 3rd
stanza. Mike scored a TD himself
after an interception by Eckstrum
gave the winners possession on the
9. The seventh point was added by
“Swede” Johnson. A Jet fumble re-
covered by Burns at mid—field set
the pattern for a last minute score,
Biloz to Hawkins for 30 yards. and
the final six points of the game.
Herb Egert got the extra point try.

After the first period the Jet of—
fense was completely bottled up.
Outstanding for the losers on the
defense were Pat Carlo and Joe
Derby.

Representative is Ruth Richter and -

WAA Manager will be Audrey Burke.

The first game rolled was taken

A1 Cannon and Red McCormick
are two transfer students who came
to State with a little high school ex-
perience in soccer plus a lot of hus-

w L tie and spirit. Both of these boys

were subs during the beginning of
the season but due to the improved
play that they have shown. they
were elevated to the first squad.
The freshman class has made
their presence felt on the soccer
squad also. Howie Fennenbach.
Ralph Adams, Phillip Billings, and
Jim Bliss are all out for the squad.
Fennenbach played his first full
game of college soccer against the
Siena “Indians” and held them
scoreless as goalie. Adams has play-
ed an aggressive type of ball and
through his efforts the “Peds” at-
tack has been very devastating. Bill-
ings and Bliss are subs for the first
team but see plenty of action in
every game. They have furnished
Coach Garcia with the depth that
he must have for a winning squad.
Every member of the squad has
done an excellent job. The spirit and
hustle coupled with some fine coach-
ing have aided in every victory. The
boys certainly deserve the support
of the school in trying to wm their
last two games. Let's all go up to
Beverwyck today at 3 p. in. and cheer
our boys to their fifth straight win.

Tuesday. KB. sparked by the fine
play of Abe Blattman. rolled to its
second straight shutout by a score
of 45-0. The Van Derzee club. never
in contention, was completely out-
played and outweighed. The weight
was extremely obvious in the line
where KB averaged a 30—pound edge
per man.

KB scored on its first play from
scrimmage as Blattmaii raced over
his right tackle for 30 yards. He
repeated this very same play the
next time KB got the ball. and it
looked as if KB was out to set a
new scoring high. However. the
VDZ defenses tightened until one
