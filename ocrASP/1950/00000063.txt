a program at Town Hall, Tuesday,
will give the identical performance
in Page Hall, Wednesday, Novem-
ber 16 at 8:30 pm. The program
will feature rarely heard music from
the Bach cantatas.

This music, "refreshing and
simple’,’ quoting from the New York
Times, is performed by an ensemble
of musicians, under the direction of
William H. Scheide, who have been
working together for more than
three years. There are nine mem-
bers, many of them experts in their
own fields: Julius Baker, flute;
Robert Bloom, oboe; Bernard
Greenhouse, ’cello; Maurice Wilk,
violin; Jean Carlton, soprano; Rob-
ert Harmon, tenor; Margaret To-
bias, alto; Norman Farrow, bass-
baritone; and Sergius Kagen, piano.

Other activities designed by the
Group to celebrate the Bi-Centen-
nial death of John Sebastian Bach
in 1750 include a weekly broadcast
on NBC and a series of concert
tours. In addition, a motion picture.
“A Time for Each," has been re-
leased which was highly praised at
the Edinburgh Festival last sum-
mer.

 

BEFORE YOU SMOKE THEM

...you can tell Chesterﬁelds will smoke milder,
because tobaccos that smell milder smoke milder.

AFTER YOU SMOKE THEM

...you have no unpleasant after-taste.

WHILE YOU SMOKE THEM you get more pleasure than
any other cigarette can give you—that’s why millions of

smokers say: THEY SATISFY.

The auctioneers were beside

Did you spend your noons
studying for mid-scms? Well,
don’t tear your hair out. It’s
not hopeless yet. How about that
long-dreamed rhumba lesson—

filthy hot rod—Jai style; eating
from the hands of Don Ely (he‘s
up for waitering); that term
paper perfectly typed by Mary

Or are you simply bored with
life in general? Opportunity
