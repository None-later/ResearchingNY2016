Cash Courses . . . .

Several times each year someone brings up the
subject of new courses which they would like to
see added to the curriculum of State College.
Among those most often mentioned are. an inten-
sive grammar course, one equally intensive in
Journalism for English Majors, preferably after
the Sophomore year, and a course in basic New
York State history for Social Studies majors who
will be expected to teach that material in seventh
and ninth grades.

It seems that here is a suggestion which has
more than a little merit. Perhaps we could con-
sider new courses which would help us be bettei
teachers, rather than constantly keep trying to get
the administration to add such courses as philos-
ophy to the curriculum, though such a course
might fill a void in our intellectual development.

Students who are called to act as advisors at
high schools in the state have to be prepared in
the fields they are to advise. Stagecraft, Coaching,
Creative Writing and Audio-Visual Aids, regular
curriculum courses, help in such training, but
more is needed. Information picked up in working
on NEWS, Fed and in student government can be
helpful, but the curriculum courses could go fur-
ther if they were taught by trained individuals and
not by students who were taught by students for
generations of staffs and officers.

Extra abilities pay well in New York's public
schools. Several State grads owe their jobs and
their increased salaries to their State Driver-Train-
ing Teacher certificates. According to Mr. Gibson,
supervisor of the course here, one ex-Health 121
student is now augmenting his salary by more than
half by teaching driving in adult education classes.

If you are going to teach, it‘s to our benefit to
interest our students and increase our weekly take
by wise use of Collegiate Clubs and Courses.

lt Makes One Shiver . . .

Korea and Manchuria may seem very remote,
especially if none of your closest family or friends
are there. This week, in Milne, as well as in other
secondary schools throughout the city and state,
teachers have been instructing their pupils in safe-
ty measures in the event of an Atomic attack in
the area.

Children are being taught through drills to fall
instantly on the floor under their desks at the
first warning. Those near windows are to pull
the shades by means of extra long pulls that have
been installed, this to prevent cuts from flying
glass. w,
All sleeves are to be pulled down and all exposed
parts of the body covered if possible. After an
interval the children are told to crawl to the hall
and lie against the wall until told of the all-clear.

When such measures are deemed necessary by
school and defense authorities, it certainly brings
the threat of war closer. When school leaders, sen-
lots and men about to complete their degrees are
drafted or enlist just before graduation, it makes
one feel a cold, heavy pain and wonder just what is
going to happen and is war inevitable?

Who has the answer? Does it lie with the UN?
Ur with our State l)partnicnt? Congress? l‘arliz
ment? The Cominform? Does the progress 0‘
civilization, or its complete destruction lie within
the scope of mankind?

Who knows? liut you can go berserk wondering!

If Harrison Smedley Burlap said
it once, he said it once: “Tradition,
to be effective, must not fit too
tightly." This is the happy state-
ment that may yet save State Col-
lege from that fate worse than
death—a college without a Canas-
ta team. For it is up to us to ral-
ly around the banner that has been
fearlessly raised, and to turn our
backs on Posterity—if we are to
turn our backs at all.

Firstly, we must organize. (It
doesn't really matter what.) But we
must have some Purpose. Perhaps
if we had a Committee for Tradi-
tions that could investigate new

QWM

To the Editor:

 

 

Someone asked us. so—here’s the
scoop. Two weeks ago a certain col-
umn in the State College News de-
rided Inter-sorority and Inter-fra-
ternity for scheduling of the Christ-
mas Ball.

Last May or June when the heads
of all organizations were asked to
schedule their events 1.8.0. and
I.F.C. scheduled their annual Xmas
Ball for December ninth. and the
necessary preliminary arrangements
were made. When the new semester
started the Ten Eyck was rented
and our plans were set. Then the
big blow came—there had been a
home basketball game scheduled for
December ninth, in spite of the fact
that We had definitely set our date
the semester before. Realizing that
this situation should not exist the
Ball committee began to investigate
the possibilities of hiring a hall for
December 16. There was no place
avalable for that date. Let it be
known then that the dance was
scheduled last year.

The problem at hand, after we
realized that no place would be
available for our second choice date,
was to decide whether we should
have the dance on a Friday night
or to take a stand and have our
dance on the night that we had
scheduled it for last semester. Let
us explain our final stand.

We can not be compared, first of
all with the Junior class and their
Prom, primarily because we have no
large treasury to fall back on in
case of an unsuccessful dance-wc
can call on the fraternities and so—
rorities for aid which has been done
in the past. but the hardship which

ways of quickly aging some tradi-
tions (they really improve with age),
it might be possible to inaugurate
that Easter Egg Hunt event for Ri-
valry in time to get one in this
year. Or perhaps we might inaug-
urate a Blow Up Draper Hall Day
to take some of the strain out of
the long cold weeks of February and
March.

But of course these are Just tent-
ative suggestions. There isn't a rea-
son in the world why the Committee
for Traditions couldn’t handle the
whole thing quite efficiently once
they put their minds to it. It would
probably snowball into something
really big, with suggestions for wor-
thy traditions pouring in from the
student body.

When you look at this in the
right, way, there is no reason at all
why the Sophomore Ladies' Aid has
to meet on the same night as the
rehearsals for the Grad’s Big-4
(which some people say is untra-
ditional). or why the orangutangs
in the Biology lab have to wear
their beanies until they complete
Ed 23 (which nobody has mentioned
before).

Yes, Harrison Smedley Burlap has
given us all something to think
about. Let's not bother.

 

a loss of fifty or sixty dollars can
cause a sorority or fraternity work-
ing on a small budget need hardly
be explained. With this in mind we
need only say that we must meet
expenses by the number of tickets
that we sell. Last year there were
100 couples at the Junior Prom and
in contrast there were 300 couples
at the 1949 Christmas Ball. We could
never have met our expenses with a
crowd of only 100 couples.

Last year there were five State
College women to every State College
man who attended the Xmas Bail. Is
it fair to hold the dance on Fri-
day and exclude approximately 30%
to 40% of the school because they
can not get a “date” for the dance
or should we exclude 40 to 50 stu-
dents tabout 2% of the school) be—
cause we were told too late that
there was a basketball game sched-
uled after we had scheduled the
dance!

Since both of the games Will be
over by 10:30 and the dance is
scheduled fi'om 10 to 2»——perhaps it
will be possible for the players to
get to the dance also, if they so dc-
sire.

Inter—sorority and
Inter—fraternity Councils.

Uncle Sam's 'Come-Hilher’ Look Gardngr Releases Data ,
Rouses State's Men From Studies on statesmen szerments‘

By PEACE & PLATT

That gally clad figure that you've
been hearing whispers about State
recently seems to be casting draft-
appraising eyes on our boys. Uncle
Sam has given a few statesmen
that come-hither look, but an over-
all picture shows that he has not
greatly disturbed the ratio of men
to women.

Of the 252 men polled last week
in assembly only 66 have received
their questionaires and of these only
ten have had their physicals. Forty-
threc statesmen have been classi-
fied as l-A, while four are in the
4-}? group. Nineteen have received
other classifications. One poor fel-
low lists himself as 8-F—4-F in the
last war plus 4-F in this adds up
to 8-F. Forty-two of those replying
to the poll said that they were too
young to be drafted.

the loose who clasifies himself as
“very dangerous" and another who
says he’s dead! That would seem to
be the hard way to escape the
draft!

Deferments have been granted to
11 men, most of which are to last
until next June. Since deferment
depends on scholastic standing in
so many cases, there are rumors
that there will be many new aspir-
ants to the Dean's list. Several of
those deferred are members of the
National Guard or one of the serv-
ice reserves.

Thirteen men have given previous
service to their country. Several of
these veterans have received defer-
ments and most of them have been
re-classified.

One patriotic soul, perhaps speak-
ing for many of his fellow men
stated, "I haven't heard from my
draft board. 1' hope that they’ve
forgotten me." We hope so too. If
the present trend toward the draft
continues women will have to en-
list in self defense!

SCA. IVCF, and IZFA have sche-

D&A Creoles
Affiliate Group

Last Friday, the first meeting of
the Drainatics and Art affiliates was
held. The 31 charter members of
this new division of D&A Council
began preliminary functions under
the direction of Agnes E. Futterer,
Assistant Professor in English Dra-
matics, and Henry Smith '52, mem-
bers of the Conn-eil.

Approved by Student Council, a
new constitution for D&A provides
for the affiliate as the intermediate
group between a try-out and mem-
bership system to Dramatics and
Arts Council.

The functions of the D&A affili-
ates are to augment activities of
D&A Council and to supply a train-
ed core of serious workers for all
dramatic and artistic activities. and
in general to provide a large sphere
of operation for those State Col-
lege students who are interested in
the theatre and in the fine arts.

Membership to D&A affiliate is
based on a system of 50 hours of
productive work by a tryout in any
phase of State College dramatic and
artistic activities. Affiliates will be.
selected by D&A Council after due
consideration or the quality of this
work and of the student's indication
of interest.

In the spring- of each year. D&A
Council will re-elect three to five
people from the affiliates to become
regular members of the Council.

At its first meeting, the affiliate
made plans for its future activities.
The members have decided to do
extensive work in all phases of (ll‘il-
matic and fine art work which
heretofore have not been offered at
State College.

College Grades
To Give Status

In order to clarify the draft sit-
uation for the men of State Col-
lege, Dr. Randolph s. Gardner, As-
sistant Professor of Mathematics at
Milne, has released the following
data. According to Gardner, stud-
ents should particularly observe the
difference of a postponement and
a deferment.

Recently, local boards had been
advised that “Operations Bulletin
No. 1 (the most recent of the Se-
lective Service Acts) does not super-
cede Section 6(1) 2 of the original
Act which provides for postpone-
ment of the induction of a college
student who while pursuing a full-
time course is ordered to report for
induction. A registrant may be de-
nied a deferment, but he may not
be denied a postponement, if he
is entitled thereto under Section
6(1) 2 of the Act."

The difference between a post-
ponement and deferment is as fol-
lows: In a postponement the regis-
trant retains his classification of A-1
and his induction is postponed until
the end of the academic year; then,
unless there is a reason to reopen
the case, the student must report
for induction. It is not necessary
for a student to be in the upper
50% of his class to obtain a post-
ponement. The deferment is grant-
ed to a person who has already
completed one year of college and is
in the top half of his class. He is
given a classification of 2-A and
is entitled to finish his school year
or for a period which the Draft
Board will determine. However this
period may not exceed 'one year
when the registrant must present
new information to the local board.
