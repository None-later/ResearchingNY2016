Downey Submits
Tentative Plans
For Film Revision

Names Committee Heads
To Direct Renovation

Tentative plans for the revising of
the film concerning State College
have been released according to
Martha Downey ’51. student Direc-
tor of the film. Students who will
head committees have been ap-
pointed to aid in the revision.

According to the plans as out-
lined by Dr. Floyd E. Hendrickson,
Professor of Education, and Miss
Downey. there will be 108 sequences
which will cover many new scenes
as well as remaking of obsolete
scenes in the present film. These
sequences will not only depict the
academic life but also the social life
of the students.

Collins Approves Script

A script for the movie was
submitted to Dr. Evan R. Collins,
President of the College, who ap-
proved it. Filming will take place
from now until May, at which time
the film will be released to high
schools throughout the state.

Film to Advertise State

It is hoped that this movie will
advertise State's functions and po-
tentialities and will interest high
school students in attending the
college, according to Miss Downey.
A main factor in making the
film a success, especially group
scenes, depends on the cooperation
and interest of‘ the student body as
a whole as well as those participat-
ing lll individual scenes.

Committee heads recently appoint-
ed are: Assistant Directors. Patricia
Jai and Georgina Mauiness; Make-
up and Costumes, Marvin Poons;
Art, Virginia Szatkowski. Seniors;
Casts. David Shepard; Lights. Alan
Stevenson; and Music, Mary Borys.
Juniors. Members of the various
committees will be announced in the
near future.

Activities For Weekend

Eds' ldiosyncrasies

We’ve all heard of “Chloe”
but have you ever heard of
"Chlorine." The new nickname
was attached to one of the
Junior Editors as a. result of
the “Lack of Talent" Show pre-
sented Wednesday night in the
PD. by the Sophs Newa tryouts.

In the satirical comedy,
Breezy Brezinsky and Irene
Dick depicted two other char-
acters, Victrola. Bade and Dis-
grace Smith as they are seen
through the Soph’s eyes. Sing-
ing and dancing was interrupt-
ed occasionally by the hysteri-
cal giggling of “the Chief” as
portrayed by Jean Corlgliano.
Jordine Skoff received
rum and maple cigarettes for
having the most lack of tal-
ent; while Barb Peace chiseled
sunglasses for the least lack of
talent. Dave Thomas won a lem-
on for the most sour perform-
ance and Breezy received a first
grade reader for the funniest
performance.

Any resemblance between the
“Snake Pit” and the P.0. atmos-
phere was purely coincidental.

 

1News, To Send
Press Delegates

An addition in classroom facilities
culls for an addition in sleeping
comforts so (in case the sound of
hammering hasn't brought your at-
tention to the fact) a new dorm is
being constructed opposite the cot-
tages on Western Avenue. Due to
different arrangements in the new
dorm, the siudcnts living there will
find conditions quite differan

As the girls leave with their dates,
they may encounter Myskunia mem-
bers hurrying to their meeting in an
adjoining room or u faculty tea in
thc music room may be interrupted

neighboring Publications Office. Re-
frigerator "raiders" will have to fork

Next full we hope to see 300 Stutc
students who'll look relaxed and

It looks as if we'll all want a room
in the new dormitory.
