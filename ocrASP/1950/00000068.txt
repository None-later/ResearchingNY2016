name chaperone be changed to
guest so the faculty will not feel
so format. All colleges with the ex-
ception of Brockport and Albany is-
sued meal tickets for their cafeteria
which students, not living in dorms
where food was served, were forced
to use.

At Buffalo where the Student

Union is in operation. all organiza-

mission is charged are held Also
refreshments served at these func-

school year. The registration fee was
raised to $30 for next year instead
of $25 because of rising prices.

As a result of the conference held
last year, other State College Teach-

44W
By PAUL BUCHMAN

Last week we made a few assump-
tions about varsity athletics at
State. On these we must all agree
as a basis for any suggestions con-
cerning varsity sports. These three
assumptions are (1) everybody loves
a winner, (2) States doesn’t have a
winner (and is not likely to have a
winner in the foreseeable future).
and (3), to have a winner. a school
must have a system. and to have
a system, a school must have money.

Now to go on with the obvious
conclusions that must be drawn
from these assumptions.

It's Time To Be Realistic

It's about time people around here
got to be realistic enough to see
that as long as the administrative
status quo is maintained, it will be
almost impossible to improve our
varsity athletic fortunes. That is. as
long as there is no money backing
the teams that represent State col-
lege, we will have no sustained suc-
cesses—no matter what sport is im-
plied. Of all the varsity sports at
NYSCT, soccer alone has any chance
of success in any consistent manner.
i.e.. it is the only sport in which we
have any chance of ever becoming
a “power” and in spite of the fact
that our soccer team finished the
season with a 5—2 record. the situa-
tion still remains whereby soccer is
student supported, and purely ama-
teur in every sense of the word. As
noble as a purely “amateur” varsity
sport is. it is apparent that it will
not be a winner.

RP! Outstanding

The outstanding soccer team in
the tri—city area is at RPI. The next
best team is at Union. Next best to
these is possibly State. Slena fans
would dispute this. That is not the
issue. however. It is why is RPI the
outstanding soccer school in the
Capital District? It all goes back to
the fact that they (RPI) have two
things—money and a system. True.
their system is strictly small time.
but it is a system. They have a paid
staff that does nothing but public
relations work. To aid this staff,
there is a program of student assist—
ance. These RPI men get $1 per
hour to attend varsity games, write
and distribute stories about them.
and to sit at a desk and answer the
telephone. And to RPI. it is worth it.
One Ultimate Realization

All of this boils down to one ulti-
mate realization—that varsity ath-
letics have no place at State as
long as the school is run the way
that it is. Since it is unlikely that
neither the faculty or student body
will be able to bring about any revo-
‘utionai'y change in State‘s admin-
istrative system so that we might
have at. least a chance for success in
athletics of an intercollegiate na-
ture. than it is logical that a change
in our athletic system be made.

That change naturally suggests a
switch to an emphasis on intramural
athletics. A good intramural pro-
gram. while it will never got big
headlines for NYSCT, and will nev-
cr get really promising athletes to
come to State. will be the nearest
possible approach to a "sports for
all" program that we can arrive at.
Do not. read into what I have said
the idea that the school will imme-
diately become a bee-hive of intra-
mural activity. A concerted effort to-
ward this end is the means by which
an active. intramural program is or-
ganlzcd.

We don't have the facilities for a
good intrunnn'ul program. you say?
We would if our gym were used for
nothing but intraniurals! Varsity
basketball takes up much time that
could well be put to student Use. Our
tremendous varsity budget, if (ii-
Vt‘l‘ti‘tl to strident use. could buy
quite a bit of sorely needed equip-
ment.

Not li‘ar-li‘etched

This scheme I propose is not us
far-fetched as might be imagined.
’l‘oilay's trend in collegiate athletics
is definitely a trend toward de-
empliasls with the possible excep—
[ion of basketball. which is a good
sport for a small school to become
a big power, on a small budget).

Luck of attendance at games of
our school clearly shows the general
lack of interest. toward varsity alli-
lellcs that. is inherent in the stu-
dent body. Varsity athletics may be
traditional. but they don't really
"belong" at. our school. so isn‘t. it
about time. we stopped making a
laws of it?

Angels-Finks To Battle Today

For Intramural Pigskin Champion

Angels Top EEP

I For First Defeat

In Four Seasons

Last Thursday in a hard fought
and extremely Well played game the
Angels downed Potter Club by the
score of 13-8. Once more the Angels
rode to victory on the arm of Biloz
as both their scores came on flips
from big Mike.

In the first quarter the Angels
looked as though they were going to
bust the game wide open as they
scored on their very first play from
scrimmage. This play was a long
pass which Brown caught in the end
zone after it had been partially
blocked by both Carter and Telfer.
Carter Scores 0n Interception

Carter electrified the crowd as he
appeared from nowhere to snatch a
pass from Tauroney and race 30
yards to pay dirt. A long kick by
Telfer landing out of the An-
gel end zone gave the Angels
the ball on their own 12. Biloz, after
trying some futile running plays.
took to the air and hit on three
straight short passes. A fourth pass
was snagged by Eckstrum on the 1
yard line and gave the Angels a
first down. Here they were stymied
for 3 plays. but on the fourth one, a
pass. once more to Brown. was good
for the score.

Potter Attack Rolls

1n the second half. behind superb
blocking. the Potter attack began to
1'0”. Twice in the third quarter they
drove to within the ten yard line
only to be stopped by the Angels’
defenses. Especially good on these
occasions was Harry Johnson who
twice in succession nailed runners
for good five yard losses. After the
second of these stands. which ended
on the 2 yard line. Potter scored an
additional two points. This occurred
as Biloz. attempting to run the ball
out of his end zone. slipped on the
muddy turf.

Potter threatened again as La-
Manna followed his blocking back
to the Angel 40, and Carter then
pulled another Swiakl as he speared
a pass on the 10 yard line while 8
feet off the ground.

Frosh Rip SOphs;
Hoppey, Walker
Shine In Rout

In the traditional rock-‘ein sock-
‘em rivalry day football game. the
highly regarded freshman clcvcn ex-
ploded with three second half
scores to make the day a pain-filled
one for the outclassed Sophomore
aggregation as they coasted to a
26—0 win.

Blue Devils Move

Early in the second period the
Sophomores kicked out at midfield.
Walker then pitched beautifully to
end Jim Bennett who was bounced
out of bounds on the 15. Walker
then hit Hank Lull on the 5. The
touchdown resulted from a bullet
pass to Bob Hartman in the end
zone. The frosh star added the extra
point on a wide end sweep.

Never. according to old followers
of this rivalry day game, did the
frosh display such a second half of
aerial activity. Bob Hartman run
the opening kick-off back to the
Red Dcvd's 40 to set up the second
touchdown. Walker threw to back
’I‘om iloppey on the 25. After a Hill-
nine, play netted live yards. the some
combination accounted for a touch-
down on another spectacular 20
yard completion.
lloppey Interception Leads to T1)

On the initial play after the en-
suing kickoff l-ioppey intercepted
Sophomore ace Abe lilaltnmn's
ilt‘ll\'t‘ on the frosh 40. With Walker
passing and bootlegglng beautifully.
the inspired iilue Jays drove to the
Soph's five yard line in just four
plays, Walker threw to liill i-iowleli
for the third touchdown. The extra
point. was added on another Walker
pass. lids lime to the alert 'l‘om
lioppey.

in the final period the lllue Jays.
refusing to flood their lineup with
l't‘xt‘l't‘l‘h’, struck again. Another
lilullniun puss was intercepted by
iloppey. 'l‘om then assumed the
throwing and completed three in a
row. the final one to Walker for a
TD

In a game that was highlighted
by some fine playing by Raoul Nu-
nez, Jim Warden, and Dave Weath-
erby. the Feds rolled to their fifth
victory in the final game of the 1950
soccer season.

Nunez Scores Three

Raoul Nunez hit pay dirt three
times for the Garcia men and Bill

Turner accounted for the two scores
by Plattsbui'gh.

Nunez scored the first goal for the
boys from Page Hall at 5:05 of the
second quarter on a direct shot that
slipped through the hands Of the
Plattsbui'gh goalie.

The Eagles from Plattsbui'gh
bounced back to tie the game with
four minutes of the third quarter
gone on a shot by Forgioni that
bounced off Fennenbach only to be
blasted right back in by the former.
State was not to be denied as “Lit-
tie“ Raoul Nunez fcinted the Eagles”
goalie out of position and then
drove the ball through. Bill Reyn-
olds broke into the scoring column
early in the fourth quarter on a
dribbing shot that just rolled over
the big white stripe.

score their second goal of the day
in three minutes and forty-five sec-
onds of the fourth quarter to make
the score 3—2. Nunez scored his third
goal of the afternoon on a beautiful
play that found Ralph Adams cross-
ing- the ball nicely from the deep left
corner and Nunez booting it through
to make the score 4—2 and end the
scoring for the clay.

Finks Beat KDR
ln Play-OllﬁTilt

This afternoon at 3:30 on Page
Field the IM football championship
shall be decided in a tussle between
the F inks and the Angels. The latter
club won the Beverwyck League title
by going through seven games un-
defeated. The Finks took the Page
League crown in a special play-off
game with KDR and finished their
season with a won six and lost one
record.

Kaehn Scores First TD

All the scoring in the play-off
game came in the last five minutes
of the first half. Up to this point
neither team had been able to mus-
ter an offensive drive. Ray Champ-
lin faded on third down and passed
31 yards to Al Kaehn for the first
six points of the game. A minute
later Don Sonbei'g recovered a KDR
bobble on the loscr's twenty and two
plays later Kachn passed to Tom
role for the other Fink score. Again
the extra point attempt was futile.
and the wincrs lcd' 12-0. With ithe
final seconds of the first half tick-
ing away. the Finks gained posses-
sion of the pigskin and elected to
gamble for another quick score. This
backfired as Ray Champlin heaved
a long pass down field intended for
Dooley. but Jerry Gorinan intercept-
ed on his own two yard line and re-
turned it the length of the field for
the only KDR score. Hausner passed
to Bill Wiley, registering the extra
point.

Defensive Play Outstanding

Both aggregations missed golden
opportunities to score in the last
half. The pressure was on and neith-
er club could punch one over the
final stripe although the advantage
presented itself time and time again.
Brilliant. defensive play featured
this half of the game and the Page
League title went to the Finks by a
12-7 margin.

(‘hamps To Be Crowned Today

in today's championship game. the
weather providing, there should be
quite a bit of aerial activity. The two
finalists both tend to rely on pass-
ing as their main offensive weapons.
Highlighting the Fink offense will
be the passing of Ray “The Arm"
Champlin. Tom Yolc and “Killer”
Kachn's catching abilities. Pat Doo-
lcy‘s kicking talent and the rugged
line play of Paul Ward and Don
Sonbei'g. The tiger-like play of Mike
Cortcsc features their defense.

The crew from Saint Mary's rely
on the offensive abilities of Mike
Biloz. Pete Hawkins. Harry Johnson.
“Red” Eekstrum. Bob Brown. and
Herb Egert and they turn to Chet
Buchanan. Ed Adamo and Don
Burns to thwart the opponent's of-
fcnsc.
