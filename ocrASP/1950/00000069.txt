Milne Seniors

Schedule Play

The Senior dam of the Milne
School will present its annual
Senior play tomorrow night at 8:30
p. m. in Page Hall. The play, “The
Torch Bearers,” is under the direc-
tion of Joseph Purdy '51.

A satirical comedy by George Kel—
ley, the play concerns a small the-
ater group in a hick town which is
presenting a play at Horticultural
Hall. The troubles that befall this
group from the time the curtain goes
up until it falls are enough to drive
any director mad, and they very
nearly do this to Mrs. Pampinilli,
played by Judy Detrick, according to
Purdy. Others in the cast are Harold
Vine, Betty Lou Silberg, Barbara
Steuman. and Lois Twell.

The following State College Sen-
iors are heading committees for the
play: Make-up. Jane Cook; Proper--
ties, Georgina Maginess; and Cos-
tumes, Jacquelyn Mann.

Tickets for students of State Col-
lege and Milne School may be ob-
tallied in advance for seventy-five
cents. They will also be sold at the
door for one dollar.

ALBANY. NEW YORK. FRIDAY. DECEMBER 1. 1930

Serve Turkey On Floating Barge;

[Young APGSIS’degByCO'w’ehghlAssembly Program Today

It may well be many years
before the students of State will
have to spend such a hectic and yet
memorable Thanksgiving vacation
as the past one. The tragic Long
Island train wreck combined with
freakish weather throughout left
the state awed and dazed.

The impact of the railroad acci-
dent emphasized the stark re-
alization that something must be
Peace, Herb Egert, Sophs and
Jeanne Seymour ’52, and many oth-
ers certainly had reasons to be
thankful. Because the 3 p.m. train
from Albany was a half hour late,
they were unable to catch that
train which brought death to so
many. Pat Zylke ’52, who was on
the train which was hit, was un-
hurt and stated her reaction to the
crash as, “Something I‘ll never
forget."

Joan Tantum‘s parents, who were
anxiously waiting, as were all the
rest of the Island residents, received
an anonymous phone call telling
them that the best thing to do was
to inquire at the morgue and the
hospitals for any neWS of their
homeward bound daughter. After

Wolfe Receives
Board Position

In a letter from the College Board
Editor of Mademoiselle Magazine.
Evelyn Wolfe ’51, was informed last
Tuesday that she has been chosen
to be a Mademoiselle College Board
member. As a result, Miss Wolfe
will work on the August edition of
the magazine with the other women
who have obtained the same honor.

In order to be eligible for the
selection, it was necessary for Miss
Wolfe to submit a folder of various
material, including a literary crit—
icism, an original story, and a his-
tory of her life. Moreover, she had
to give information concerning the
courses which she is taking at school
and write an essay on what she
would like to do five years from now.

Miss Wolfe was given a choice of
entering either the literary and fic—
tion, the fashion. or the art depart-
ments in the contest. Having chosen
the former field, she had to write
an article and plan its complete lay-
out as if it were to be published in
the magazine. while disclosing how
and where she had obtained her
story.

ltladcinoiscllc holds this contest
for College Board members each
year. Undergraduate student women
from coilcgcs all over the country
are ciigiblc to enter the contest.

Grand Marshall Releases Rules
For Use Ol Phonograph Records

thii phonograph records are bor-
rowed from the Campus Commis-
sion collcclioii, the i't‘Ctii'llS arc to be
returned within 24 hours, according
to Virginia Norton ’51, Grand Mur—
siiul. If the rccords are not rctin‘iied
within this time, the permission will
be rebuked.

 

following this advice, they finally
received Another call instructing
them to call the emergency station.
“No news is good news" proved to
be true for the missing one at last
reached home safely.

The ninety mile winds plus high
waters really put a damper on the
weekend events. Electric wires dang-
led dejectedly across streets and
highways, and mingled with those
of the telephone companies’ in
knotted disorder. Darkened homes
and cold oil furnaces gave impetus
to the idea of returning to the days
of the open fireplace. Have you
ever tried to do a quick job on a
term paper by candle light or a ker-
osene lamp? It can be done!

There are few advantages to an
evening at home when the home
is minus heat, cooking facilities,
lights, radio, clocks, telephone and
when the television aerial is a tang-
led heap on the front lawn! One
wonders where all the tin roofs,
shingles, clothes lilies, turkey feath-
ers and haystacks finally settled
down!

Many schools, factories and farms
completely de-mobilized by the
storm, closed for the lack of oper-
ating power but State College suf—
fered no such difficulty and was
ready for opening on schedule.

After the recent events, most stu-
dents are anxiously awaiting Christ-
mas with its quiet, restful vacation!

Rivalry Sing To Highlight

 

Timely Slogans Preach
Dangers OF Driving

“A thinking driver doesn’t .
drink: A drinking driver doesn’t
think.” "If you stop to think
you will think to stop.” These
quotations are from a list of
timely safety slogans released
by Thomas R. Gibson, Professor
of Health. With the on-coming
Christmas season, these bits of
advice take on double import-
ance. Remember, Christmas
shoppers, “Better late a few
minutes than laid up a few
months.”

“Those of you who have
been gleefully spraying pedes-
trians with the typical Albany
slush might keep in mind when
it freezes up that “When you
speed on ice death loads the
dice." Advice to you speedsters
who are in the habit of rushing
home from a late card game in
the Commons—“Car tricks of-
ten end in a grand slam."

Seriously, all drivers should
make it their business to
“Drive as if your life depend-
ed upon it—it docs.”
