“U.  Accuses Red China of ‘Open Aggression;’ ”
‘New War,’ Says M’Arthur; Truman Sees Aides;

200,000 of Fee Advance Up To 10 Miles in Ko-

rea”—this headline, taken from the front page of
the New York Times Wednesday morning, follow-
ed by “U. S. Picks Site of Atom Plant To Help
on Hydrogen Bomb” make even the most phleg-
matic of us say “Look what that older generation
has gotten us into now.” .

Everybody who is anybody has made a public
statement. From General Chennault’s statement
(that he could get 400 million Nationalist Chi-
nese to fight the Reds) to the comment of one of
the local rabble rousers, waiting for his draft no-
tice, (he believes that we are blundering. in foreign
policy so miserably that complete force is the only
solution) we hear solutions varied in numbers and
types to the situation.

Wednesday night Secretary of State Dean Ache-
son made the worry over possible war an official
thing with mention of the “brazen” act by Com-
munist China which “holds grave danger for the
peace of the world.”

What can we do about it? Not much—except
the usual things; go and fight, stay homeOand
wait, pray if you believe in it, keep a continual
hope that someday our generation will be .able to
solve our problems better, and go on With our
daily activities.

Got Religion? . . .

Often a sensitive situation is presented before
a group and the reaction is strictly “hands ott.’
This was not the situation Wednesday night in
Student Council when a discussion occurred con-
cerning speakers in Assembly. This discussmn was
on a particularly sensitive subject because _it in-
volved the presentation of speakers on religion in
assembly.

An unfortunate occurrence at the last assembly,
however, caused many to question the intelligence
of bringing speakers on religion or from the clergy
to a compulsory assembly. it was generally agreed
that it would not be practical to make assemblies
on a voluntary basis when outside speakers were
obtained for assembly and no one wished to sug-
gest that religious speakers be barred from speak-
ing in an assembly.

A motion was then made and passed that. the
Chairman of the Assembly program committee
would instruct organizations presenting Assembly
speakers that their speeches be of a "universal ap-
proach.”

If this legislation of Student Council brings bet-
ter speakers to Assembly it will have served its
purpose. it is impossible to tell a speaker what
to say. If it were possible there would be no point
in bringing the speaker here. Perhaps in the future
there will be closer direction in choosing Assembly
speakers through this motion but an audience
which is present by compulsion 0r voluntarily Will
still be at the mercy of the speaker as he presents
his message.

For those of us who were embarrassed or of-
fended: it is not the first or the last time where
we will be in situations (compulsory) where a
speaker's words or manner may be disturbing. This
irritation often stimulates intelligent thinking.

74040 Mom

 

I knew it; I could tell by the
pale fuchsia glow behind her ears
and creeping up from her eroded
bosom. She wanted more than any-
thing else in the world to scream as
loud as she was able, “Bartle, stand
up. Class, I want you to take a good
look at the worst Schnook I've
ever had as a student in the last
twenty-seven years." But I knew
that the ever anxious respect for
trousers coupled with the frustrating
security of an assistant professor-
ship would restrain her; she would
go home after class and probably
beat the gizzard out of her pet tom
cat.

So I continued, “But miss, oh
pardon me. Doctor So-and-so, I
simply can’t understand the pass-
age.” She always called on us al-
phabetically and my turn was next.
There were four minutes left in the
period. It was merely a question of
misunderstanding that paragraph
or gumming up one of my own. As
usual, I attempted to gargle on
someone else’s midnight oil.

I wiped my handkerchief over my
forehead and, having previously
dipped it in the water fountain,
looked up at her with blinking eyes
and cold sweat trickling down my
cheeks.

It is unfortunately inconceivable
that anyone with such a fervant (if
slightly misdirected) devotion to
foreign languages could have under-
stood how anyone, namely, me,
could be so damnably ignorant. I
couldn't tell whether the horse was
riding the hero, or the hero the
horse; besides. the heroine was
standing around shivering in noth-
ing but a sexy subjunctive. So what?

Here we are back from vacation,
with only a few weeks until another
one, so to occupy your spare time,
here are a few events going on in
Albany.

At the Playhouse, the current hit
is “For Love or Money,” by Hugh
Herbert. It’s a comedy about a sick
actor who lives on Long Island, and
the play stars Duncan Baldwin,
Nancy Cushman and Roberta Jo-
nay. Miss Cushinan is Mrs. Baldwin
in private life, and both she and her
husband were starred at the Play-
house two years ago. The past year
they have been in a road company
of "Death of a Salesman.“

The International Ice Review,
starring Eileen Leigh, U. S. Olympic
star, and a cast of 50, will be at
the RPI Field House December 4,
5, and 6. The show starts at 8:30.

The Junior Chamber of Commerce
is presenting a Hobby Show at the
New Scotland Ave. Armory Thurs—
day, Friday and Saturday of this
week.

Laurence Olivier's “Henry V" is

 
 

By FRED BARTLE -—-—-———"—“

There have been millions of words
written in English that I can’t un-
derstand either.

She glared at me from the para-
pets of her textbook, “Mr. Bartle, if
you will please look closely, I shall
repeat.” Her tongue licked at the
edges of her words, and they made
her mouth pucker.

The second hand of my watch—
carefully wedged in the slots of the
chair in front of me—seemed to be
utterly exhausted, for as she mech-
anically stumbled over the transla-
tion it creeped slower and slower
still. She knew the lines by heart,
and as she spoke her eyes sought
out a school-teacher‘s heaven where
surely she implored her creator to
transfigure me into something, any-
thing edible so she could knead the
life out of me with her potent set
of new teeth.

There were still three minutes
BF. (before freedom) when my last
trump was forced. The word trans-
lated into the English ‘mish mash.’
I guess she knew it was coming, be-
cause she called on me without low-
ering her gaze from the ceiling.

“What does ‘mishmash’ mean?”

“Are you sure you don’t know?"

“Why Miss, I mean Doctor, is
there a mistrustful hole in your
heart?"

“Never mind . . . ah . . . never
ah . . . ”
“Mishmash?”

It was a success; I had moved
from the defensive to the offensive.
Probably she had translated a wierd
looking foreign word into just as
wierd ‘mishmash' more than a hun-
dred times. Each time rationalizing
that there was no need to look up
the English meaning because no one
would ask her anyway.

She mumbled a few words about
not being an English teacher while
stealing a sly glance at her own
watch propped up under the half
open cover of her classbook. Then
she suddenly remembered that it
was time to give the assignment for
next time.

She made the usual check mark
on her list that meant I had to
concentrate on learning the first
twenty lines and a new stall to
prevent my being caught short at
the end of the period. Sometimes it
came awfully close.

One time towards the end of the
year as the class spouted from the
door I happened to catch her eye
and we both started to laugh. I
don't know whether I was laughing
at her, or whether she was laugh-
ing at me. And you know, that wor-
rics me.

playing this week at the Colonial
Theatre. but..tonite is the last nite.

Every Wednesday night at 10:15
over station WROW. Radio Council
presents “Capital Campus." It be—
gan last night with Don Ely play-
ing host to a quintet from Bethle-
hem Central High School as the
guest stars.

Gama-5141'»

By GORSKIE and KYLE

The Common-Stator is given the widest latitude as
author of this column, although his viewpoint. do
not necessarily reflect those of the Sun CoLLlGI
News.

LUCKY WE'RE BACK . . .

Even though we could use a few more days' rest . , .
after fighting our way through monsoons, bassoons,
and typhoons . . . not to mention little things like
train wrecks and indigestion . . . as one columnist so
aptly put it, “If you're planning to use the Long Is-
land Railroad. DON’T!" . . . incldently, on the trip
back from the Island, the center of the train had a
conspicuous sag in it, while the first and last cars
were dark and empty . . . mice in those cars, maybe?
. . . compared to this, the weather seemed rather
mild . . . although the people shopping by candlelight
in the A and P and those rowing out to get the New-
burgh Ferry may not have thought so.

SHE CAN BE WOOED . . .

At the “Winter-lewd" . . . the theme is awfully good
. . . the publicity better . . . but that clever little
igloo looks like Albany snow after a week of rain . . .
strictly from slush.

MONEY MOTION . . .

Debate Council's motion for a $450 addition to their
budget will be voted on in assembly today . . . Student
Board of Finance feels that the money should not be
granted because it will cause a deficit in the budget
this year . . . but Student Council has approved their
motion . . . since Debate has proved so well its worth,
why not give them the money?

CONTRAST . . .

Overheard between English major and Science ma-
jor: “I wear my coat collar up, too. It's arty that
way." "I wear mine up to keep my neck warm."

ABOUT RELIGIOUS SPEAKERS . . .

We feel that their topics should have a more uni-
versal appeal to a mixed audience such as State's . . .
and also since the assembly is compulsory . . . we are
in favor of informational talks about every religion.
but when they digress to conversion, the line should
be drawn.

FROM “COKE” ’I‘O COCOA . . .

Don’t let those nippy winds get you down this win-
ter . . . just whisk into the commons for a cup of
steaming. stimulating hot chocolate . . . other cold
drinks will soon be available. too. when the new bev-
erage machine is installed . . . got your dimes ready?

 

 

 

APOLOGIES . . .

Admittedly, the apologies in our last assembly were
very clever and amusing . . . at times . . . but the hula,
especially at that particular assembly, caused a few
too many writhings to be fun . . . remember that dis-
cretion might be the better in an apology.

BROUGHT ’I‘O MIND . . .

By apologies is the tradition of warnings . . . we‘d
just like to throw ottt the question to SA as to whether
a person should be removed from class office because
he received four of them . . . somehow it seems a little
hard.

SING FEST . . .

Today ‘54 and ‘53 will compete in the rivalry sing
. . . tip to the Sophs . . . birds have a greater reputa—
tion for singing than devils.

NOTED . . .

Sonic organization was allowed to sign up for room
twenty on Wednesday at three-thirty . . . we bet the
Juniors don't mind too much.

MASQUES AND [’AGEAN’i‘S . . .

Seem to be quite the rage this year . . . with the
Kusz anti the English department, anyway . . . Eng-
lish evening, with the facility dressed in Elizabethan
costumes and Miss Futtercr reigning as Queen Eliza—
beth should prove quite exciting . . . a bawdy time
can be had by all.

MEth TO THE DEAN . . .

Thanks for making it so easy for the students who
live in "far away places" to get home in time for
Thanksgiving . . . they really appreciated it.

Oi Visual-Aids

Representatives from all the ele-

York State were present at the State
University Conference of Audio-
Visual Aids Department held in the
Lounge yesterday, and they will a1-
so be present at meetings and dis-
cussions this morning and after—
noon. The conference was called by
Dr. Hermann Cooper, Ex-Dean of
the State University of New York.

The purpose of the conference is
to explore ways and means of provi-
ding better services for a motion
picture film library in the various
schools and to find ways to im-
prove the whole Audio-Visual pro-
grams in State College.

While the representatives consid-
ered immediate needs for a motion
picture library and planned a long
range program for the future dur-
ing yesterday's session, today the
conference will consist of a review
of the audio-visual program in its
present state and will feature an an-
alysis and results of the meeting.
Dr. Floyd E. Henrickson, Professor
of Education, and Dr. Cooper will
address the representatives of the
conference today.

Polio Foundation
Slates Meeting

The Albany County Chapter of
the National Foundation for Infant-
ile Paralysis will hold a public meet-
ing Tuesday evening at 8 p. m. in
Page Hall. Dr. Hart E. Van Riper,
Medical Director of the Foundation
will be the principal speaker.

Dr. Van Riper lives at Scarsdale,

at Children‘s Hospital. Cincinnatti;
Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami;
The Division of Health Services, U.
S. Department of Labor; and as
Medical Director of the Wisconsin

in the nation's history. Dr. Van
Riper promises to reveal some rath—
er interesting results on the progress
that is being made to combat the
disease by the various research lab-
oratories. The chapter feels that the
meeting will be valuable to students
personally as well as in their future
role as teachers. The public is in-
vited and no admission will be
charged.

Pouring over the exchange, one
discovers almost everything from
soup to nuts, and sometimes an
occasional view on the more serious
side of life.

Indeed the newspapers from the
other colleges are worth giving the
once over, if only to keep up with
the latest gags and college oddities.

From The Wesleyan Transcript of
the Wesleyan Institute, we notice
this little poem about women's
fashions:

“Girls when they went out to
swim

Once dressed like Mother Hubbard.

Now they have a. bolder whim;

They dress more like her cup—
board."

From Fairfield University's 'l‘lie
Stag; “I smoke, drink, and chew.
but thank heavens I don‘t talk in
the library."

"Sad story: And there was the
sad case of the English grammar
professor who received a theme with
no punctuation marks and died try-
ing to hold his breath till the last
page. . .

According to LIFE at Michigan
College, here‘s another line about the
weaker sex: “A few women throw
themselves away, but most of them
take a pretty good aim."

At the University of Rochester,
The Campus, the school publica-
tion, sponsored a beard contest.
Since judging was to be done in an
unique way and prizes were to be
awarded to all entries, the campus
for two weeks was "haunted by men
with dark, suspicious countenances“
It seemed visitors to the college, who
knew nothing about the contest,
were quite puzzled over the situa—
Lion.

The boards were in connection
With the mom anniversary celebra-
ted by the university recently.
Included also were style shows with
antique guns.

your frilliest formal (or best suit,
as the case may be) you can pirou-

the tune of rumbling buses, but to
the soothing strains of Harry Vin—

The Junior Revue, “Here’s New
York." will be presented by the Clash
of 1952 in Page Hall Auditorium on
December 15 at 8:30 p. in. The mu-
sical is under the direction of Pa-
tricia Dargusch with musical ar-
rangements by Edward Peene.

The idea for the revue was con-
tributed by Jeanne Seymour and
the script was written by Richard
Buck, Patricia Dargusch and Ed-
ward Peene. There are no main
characters in the musical since it
centers around the tourist's view of
New York City. The scenes—the
Bowery, Chinatown, Saint Patrick's
Cathedral and many others—have
individual sets with a backdrop of
the New York skyline.

The various committee heads for
the production are as follows: Lights,
Alan Stephenson; Publicity, David
Manly; Make-up, Henry Smith;
House, Victoria Baldlno; Props, Wil-
liam Wiley; Costumes, Doris Mul-
lane; Finances, Viola Myles; Co-or-
dinator; Business Manager, Joyce
Shafer and Sets Robert Donnelly.
Special musical selections have been
composed by Jess Barnet and Rich-
ard Lorson.

Tickets will be on sale at booth
outside the commons Wednesday. All
seats are unreserved and the price
of the tickets are $.50 each. The
Junior Revue is presented for the
benefit of Campus Chest and all
funds raised from the production
will be contributed to it.
