One of the pet peeves of the State
Drama department has always been
the lack of maturity shown by the
college audiences. This childish at-
titude was particularly obvious dur-
ing the first play presented last
Tuesday night. The cast did an ad-
mirable job in spite of the audience.
The mood of the play as well as
the suspense factor was well real-
ized. Special mention should be
made of Roz Lack’s portrayal of the
wayward wife. Admittedly she was
distracted a few times by laughter
from the audience, but in her long
speeches she showed variety of_tone,
gesture, and tempo and her char-
acterization was well sustained. Jim
Hughes held his character well and
his voice was splendid during sev-
eral of his speeches. He still needs
work on gesture and freedom of
movement, but his interpretation
wasn't seriously affected by these
purely physical deficiencies. Anoth-
er excellent job can be chalked up
to Dave Shepard’s credit. His re-
straint and subtlety prevented the
more "corny" speeches from becom-

ing merely funny. His scenes with
Roz built to the fine climax of her
exit and suicide.

I wish the locale had been inti-
mated early in the play. It came as
quite a shock when Mildred Foote
addressed Roz as “signora.” It might
be a good idea for the directors of
future plays to announce the time
and place in their curtain speech.

In the case of the second play,
the clipped speech used especially by
Dick Scott and Joyce Shafer pre-
pared us for the names of the Brit-
ish railroad stations. Perhaps this
play should have been first on the
program so the audience could have
worked off their good spirits. It was
done in the fine, old melodramatic
tradition. The typically English hu-
mor of the understatements in Don
Putterman's speeches was excel-
lently done. In fact, everyone in the
cast did a fine job with the poss-
ible exception of Louis Vion whose
gangster was somewhat mild for a
type character. Sue Danzis made a
fine contrast to the heroine. Tom

did well as the mouse, Don Putter-
man was nicely ridiculous and the
lovers, Joyce Shafer and Dick Scott

The applause which has been

seems to be indicative of how We all
feel about the sets being used this
year. They're modern, suitable to
the mood, and excellently executed.

Stokes Requests
Activity Data
From Students

Everyone will be asked to fill out
Activrty Forms in Assembly today.
it has been announced by Dr. Ellen
C. Stokes. Dean of Women. Students
will write on these forms the activ-
ities in which they are interested
and the activities in which they are
presently participating.

These forms, which are kept in a
separate file in the Personnel Rec-
ords Office in Room 110, are avail-
able for both student and faculty
use. They form a very important
part of the records which are kept
for every student and are referred
to whenever a complete picture of
a student’s college accomplishments
is required. Dr. Stokes states that
now as never before outside agencies
writing to the college for recom-
mendations concerning former stu-
dents are interested in a student‘s
accomplishments outside of the
classroom as well as in it.

Because of the importance of these
forms, it is urged that all students
not in the Assembly today come to
Room 110. Draper Hall. before D;«
cember 9 in order to secure and fill
out one of them.

WAA Sends Delegates
To Vassar College Today

Meetings, Games
Highlight Program

Today five WAA girls will repre-
sent State College at the New York
State Federation of College Women's
Athletic Association's meeting,
which will continue until Sunday, at
Vassar College, Poughkeepsle. Edith
Paterson ’51, and Phoebe Fuller '52.
are the official delegates and carry
one vote. Joan Haggerty '52, Marilyn
Burke '52, and Betty Coykendall '53.
will go along as unofficial delegates.
Each college is allowed two official
delegates and one vote. and an un-
limited number of unofficial dele-
gates. The difference between official
and unofficiaal delegates is that the
former carry voting powers whereas
the latter act only as representa-
tives. Miss Isabelle Johnston, Phy-
sical Education Instructor for wom-
en, will accompany the girls.

Several Activities Planned

MISS Ellen Griffin. National Sec-
retary of the Federation. who
has a great deal of experience in

various college athletics and their Rell

problems, is slated as guest speaker.
Dicsussions on faculty—student rela—
tionships, participation of non—
athletlc‘ students in WAA sponsored
activities, the use of publicity as a
contact between the athletic council
or board and the student body.
inter-collegiate policy. and the func-
tions of athletic constitutions are
scheduled to take place Saturday
afternoon following the opening
morning session. In the evening the
girls will enjoy a planned recrea-
tional program in the gym and the
swimming pool. The session will
conclude with a business meeting on
Sunday morning. at which time the
place of holding the next confer-
ence will be decided, and officers
for the coming year will be elected.

Purpose Explained

The purpose of the NYSFCWAA
is to bind together the Women's
Athletic Associations of colleges and
universities in New York State, to
further social, physical, and moral
welfare of students by encouraging
participation in sport and rccrca-
tional activities according to the
highest standards of sportsmanship.
Any college or university in New
York State having an organized
Women's Athletic. Association with
a student executive board and hav-
ing a written constitution is eligible
for membership. The federation was
organized about four years ago to
promote closer relationships with the
National Association.

 

Sieno Cops Two,-
Tied For First

Led by Lombardo, who appeared
for the first time this year against
State, Siena took two out of three
games to gain a first place tie with
the statesmen for the Inter-colle-
giate Bowling League crown.

Don McDonald paced State’s keg-
lers to their victory in the third
and final game of the evening when
he rolled high game for the night,
223.

Goldie of Siena, registered the
lone two-hundred game of the eve-
ning for the victors but the totals
tell the story as three men achieved
the fire-hundred bracket and the
other two missed by a combined
total of 13 pins. On the other hand,
Capt. Don McDonald was the only
Statesman to roll a three-game tot-
al of over 500 and in doing so re-
corded the high total of the night.

Volleyball Crown
Taken By Pierce

Volleyball season drew to a close
last night when Beta Zeta elimi-
nated Sayles Hall, and Pierce Hall
eliminated Emag Moor in the semi-
finals.

When BZ and Pierce finally
clashed in the finals, Pierce took
the first game of a three game ser-
ies 20-4. BZ clamped down then and
came back to win the second game
16-11. The third and last game was
close up to the final minutes with
Picrcc holding a slight lead of 7-5.

of the fire with five successful
serves. In the final seconds, BZ
scored one point. but time ran out
and Pierce took the game 12-6.

By PAUL BUCHMAN

I am forever branded as a cynic.
It is done. People who have read
the last two columns in this space,
and who have made their unique
interpretations of it (generally not
that which was intended), have ap-
proached me with dubious attitudes
of disdain. Members of varsity
teams. of whom no mention what-
soever has been made (in any per-
sonal manner) in the past two
weeks, except in a sympathetic way,
have martyred themselves to their
cause (I‘m not sure what it is), and
have taken personal offense at my
writings, as if I had slandered them
individually.

An Unhappy Lot

A sportswriter’s lot is frequently an
unhappy one. To be true to sports,
he must often write half-truths and
flagrant exaggerations. To be true to
himself. he must often condemn that
very icon of which he writes. Either
way. he is attacked as a coward. and
called suspiciously vile names. If the
peopl.n concerned were not ordin-
arily both intelligent and civil, the
situation would indeed be laughabl',
As it is, it is quite ridiculous.

 

 

A Writer Is A Critic

A sports columnist is a critic. just
as much as is a literary critic or a
theatre critic. As such, a sports col-
umnist should not be content to fill
his columns with items stolen from
Brooklyn Dodger press releases. or
with plugs for coming sports events,
which we all do occasionally when
activity is at a complete standstill.
He must survey the situation and
comment on it as he sees it—come
what may.

Sports writing should not become
merely a form of propaganda ~ a
pattern into which much of today's
writing has degenerated.

Athletics And Prestige

Inevitany tied up with the ques-
tion of varsity athletics is its rela-
tion to school prestige. Most people
at State, those who live here in
their own little academic world, are
unaware of thc feelings toward the
school as maintained by most Al-
banians. Bluntly put. it can be pure-
phrased as “a school of plain women
and questionable men." We at State
know that this isn't true, but this
reputation has been fostered by
factors. the two main one's being
that teacher's colleges, as a whole,
have not too good a standing in fact
which we were recently made pain—
fully nwarc of in a certain national
picture magazine). and that too
many puny varsity squads have been
rcprcscnting State. We here are only
concerned with the latter.

Just how important can athletics
be? Siclltl was a nobody until they
hit big—time basketball!

A School‘s l'rcstigc

All this ties up with a school‘s
prcstigc. The man in the street in-
cvitnbly ties up varsity athletics with
the quality of a school. This is a
sad commentary. but true. As long
as a school hand we are concerned
now with tcnchcr's colleges) is look-
cd down upon by the gcncral public,
its graduates will be likewise scorn-
ed. As long as the general public
looks down upon graduates of touch—
cr‘s colleges. our professional stunti-
in: will not rise. (This does not im-
ply thut by removing varsity ath-
lctit's our professiomil standing will
catapult.) We must now cithcr clim—
inutc viu'sily uthlctics, or concen—
irtitc on raising the lcvcl of sports

To Open Schedule Away

 

Garcia Directs
Wrestling Club;
Plan Matches

By DAVE THOMAS

With eighteen boys as a working
nucleus Coach Joe Garcia has start-
ed a wrestling club at State College.
Attempts are being made to schedule
meets with the J.V. and freshman
teams of other schools. A tentative
wrestling match has been scheduled
witn RPI which is in the process of
initiating this sport in their school.
The match will be held after a bas-
ketball game so that everyone in
school will be able to watch the
match

Wrestling A Spectator Sport

Wrestling is without a doubt one
of the most interesting spectator
sports that has been introduced on
the college level. It is far superior to
pro wrestling in every respect and
the intercollegiate wrestler must be
in superb condition and is governed
by very strict NCAA rules that bar
many of the illegal holds that are
used in the “grunt and groan vari-
ety“ produced for the American
people.

Wrestling is a terrific conditioner.
The boys are working out on Mon-
day and Thursday nights from 7 to
9:30 pm. The emphasis in practice
is being put on the condition of each
member of the club. The members
of the wrestling club also work out
Tuesday. Wednesday. and Friday
afternoons under the watchful eyes
of Tom King and Hank Fuerbach.

Calls For Wrestlers

Coach Garcia would like to have a
lot more men turn out for the squad.
He needs men to wrestle in the 114
lb. class and also in the 123 lb. class.
If you have any interest at all it
would be to your advantage to go
out for the squad, not only from the
standpoint of what you can learn
from participating in a sport such
as this but also for the good that it
will do in conditioning your body.

Tom King and Henry Fuerbach
are the only two men who have had
any previous wrestling experience.
King wrestled on thc varsity of Islip
High School and Hank Fuerbach
wrestled for Mcmpham High School.
Other members of the club who have
shown spectacular ability are Harvey
Milk, John Burke. Jim Bliss, and
Joe Lombardi. All the members of
the squad enioy wrestling a great
deal and are showing a. lot 0f im-
provement. Anyone who is interested
in the club should see Coach Garcia
as soon as possible.

Injuries Hamper Pivot Spot

The Statesman will not be at full
strength for these initial encounters.
due to the loss of three key opera-
tives, Bob Tabor, Don Krug, and
John Zongrone. Tabor, the regular
pivot man, suffered a shoulder sep-
aratlon while scrimmagfng last week
and is lost to the team indefinitely.
Krug. a very promising freshman,
was injured in an automobile acci-
dent while returning to Albany last
weekend. Zongrone is hampered by
a chipped elbow.

This stroke of misfortune forces
Coach Hathaway to move Pete Tel-
fer to the pivot spot. Pete is a very
capable floor man and possesses a
large array of hook and jump shots.
Veterans Bob Brown, Captain Jim
Warden, Malcolm Fallek. and fresh-
man Blll Walker round out the ten-
tative starting five. Paul Carter, A1
Kaehn, and Bob Hausner are the
boys who will see a lot of service in
relief.

Face Utlca on Wednesday

The Fed hoopsters make their sec-
ond home appearance next Wednes-
day against a very powerful Utica
College quintet. The “Utes” won 18
and 10st 6 last year. They have four
out of the starting five men from
that team on this year's squad.

In their opener, an exhibition
game with the Alumni. the Feds won
54—43. The Grads made a valiant bid
for three periods but succumbed to
the hard running varsity in the last
ten minutes. O'Brien and Marks
paced the Alumni, while Bill Walker
and Don Krug led the College five
with 15 and 12 points respectively.

Coach Hathaway moved Abe
Blattmann, Art Goldin, and John
Allasio up to the Varsity squad tem-
poi'arily. This move was made to
put the team at full strength for
the rugged slate which faces the
boys from now until Christmas.
These three boys had been working
out with Coach Joe Garcia and his
JV squad.

IM Bowling,-

Oarr Leads Scores With 197, 517

The Intramural Bowling League
got off to n rousing start Tuesday.
with the playing of six games. Al-
though ull wore not close. the games
provided some very interesting shots.

The top [cum of the evening was
SLS. Whose 2269 was 81 points bet-
ttr tlnm the runner-up. Spearhead-
ing the attacks for SLS was Oarr
with u 197 high mid :1 HQ average.
l'lowcrcr, Onrr was not the only gun
in the scoring column for his team
as both ’I‘llcl'l'icn and Hughes iill-
ishcd in [‘10 top six with scorcs of
163 and iii] respectively.

The second best offense went to
Poltcr as they spilled the pins for a
score of 2208. The key man here
was Walsh, with a 164 uverugc. Had
it not been for his second game of
only 135, Lyle would have probably
have had the best score of the night.
An interesting thing about the Pot-
lcr team was the fact that they used
7 men, the largest of any outfit
there. This was due mainly to the
flu-t that their opponents. the Splits,
did not. get higher than 122 in the
first sci.

A rcul thriller started off the
Knit—Saints series. This was it till-i-
682 squeukcr which was taken by
KDR and gave them a 2 games to l

  

victory. KDR was led by Al Steph—
enson, and Johnson sparked the
Saints in their losing efforts.

In another game played the Finks
took Thurlow by a score of 2056-
1997. They also played a game which
differed by 2 points. but this was
due more to the Finks slowness in
starting than the equal pairing of
the teams.

The hardest fought game of the
evening was lost by the Jeeps to the
Beavers. Both teams got off to slow
starts but finished fast with scores
of 2105—2045. The main reason for
the Beavers success was the bowling
of Clark who finished second in the
night's standings with a 171 average.

In the final contest Dan Kelly led
the Rousers to an easy decision over
the Snafus. Danny crashed the
maples for a 143 average. As a result
both SLS teams were able to cop
victories and thus place 2 teams in
the unbeaten column. The standing
of the league follows:

i. SLS 7. Jeeps

2. EEP 8. Saints
3. F‘fnks 9. Thurlow
4. Rousers 10. Splits
5. Beavers ii. Stratus

8. KDR 12. Fearless Five
