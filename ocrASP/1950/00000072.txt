cause their Angels brought home

Colleges Report Losses
In 1950 Fall Enrollment

For the first time since the end
of World War II the American col-
leges and universities report an en-
rollment loss. The enrollment this
fall shows a 7.4 per cent decline.

A substantial decline in veteran
enrollment is partially responsible
for this loss. Another important fac-
tor is the uncertainty resulting from
the Korean crisis.

A number of teachers colleges
have fewer students this Year than
last. However. they had to turn
away more students because of lack
of facilities than any other col-
leges.

Brings Xmas Spirit

Shades of old Santa Claus!
One would almost have to be
blind not to notice the eye-
catching X m a s decorations
around the school and in the
stores.

The Co-op has gone all out
to bring that Xmas spirit to
State with its decorations of
red tinsel and icicle, while the
art students made striking
colored transparences for win-
dows in Draper Hall. Even Dr.
Green has been bitten by the
Xmas bug and has decorated her
office window with a Xmas
wreath.

Rushing crowds on Central
remind one there are only four-
teen more shopping days ’til
Xmas. Santa states that this
year all the boys are asking for
Hopalong' (‘assidy outfits and
the girls want “one of those big
dolls that walk by themselves."

Students have really started
the carpet rolling for a Merry
Christmas. But poor Rudy!
What will he do if there is no
snow?

AD To Stage
Fantasy, Force

The Advanced Dramatics class
will present two more one—act plays
Tuesday at 8:30 pm. in Page Hall.
The first play, a tragic fantasy, is
directed by Patricia Graff '51, and
the other, a farce, is directed by
Robert Donnelly '52.

Miss Grafl will present a Scan-
dinavian play which centers around

marrying an old man. although she
is in love with the hunter.

Graff‘s cast includes Robert San-
ders, Madclon Avallonc and Louis
Vion, Sophomores. and Ann Colum-
bc, Mary Beth Johnson, freshmen.

Robert Donnelly's presentation,
“Pyramus and Thisbc," is taken
from "A Midsummer Night's Dream"
by Shakespeare. The play will keep
to the traditional Elizabethan
drama by lack of sets, thus leaving
much to the imagination of the
oudicncc. Members of the cast. are:
Martha Downcy and Earl Sipc,
Scniozs; Henry Smith, Ross Feder—
ico. John Lindbcrg. Marvin Focus
and Harry Scott, Juniors; John Lan-
