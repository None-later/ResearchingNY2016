#64 70M ‘7ch

By PAUL BUCHMAN

The boys in the “John” had finally
tired of ripping apart my column
in last week‘s News, and the talk
eventually swung around to intra—

 

 

murals. Intramurnls are like the
weather. You know. "Everybody
talks about it but . .  The intra-
mural situation here ts roughly
this:

On the credit side: Like the

movies. they‘re “better than ever."
This is the biggest intramural bas-
ketbull league in many years — the
biggest. at least. since before the
war. The trend in intramural parti-
cipation is gratifying. Soon, how—
ever. the saturation point will be
leached—which brings us to the
other side of the ledger.

Not Enough Space

Debits: Lack of space. Using our
mammoth gymnasium are State
College gym classes. Milne High
gym classes. the State College Var-
sity basketball team. the State Col-
lege J.V. basketball team. Milne
Varsity basketball team. Milne J.V..

kctbnll, volleyball. and what have
your, Women's Intramural activi-
ticr, tbusketball. volleyball. badmin—
toii. nnd more). (lnnccs. games. and
WAA general activities.

So. we need more space. We all
know that. Since a college is made
up of buildings. tit really isn‘t. but
it gets cold up here in the winter)
we asked Dr. Collins. rather pessi-
misticully. what the chances were
for a new field house. Our reaction
was that he feels that State's great-
est present need. materially speak—
ing. is a new athletic building
tnlong with a new library, which we
are not concerned with hereJ. He
showed us the plans for it. It makes
you kind of proud of State to see
those blueprints, even if they are
nothing but puper. conservatively.
he estimates that it will be about
five years before it is built. SC’I‘
even has the land for the field
house; luck of funds is holding up
construction. It's reassuring. uny-
wuy. Someday we might have u
plucc to hang up our wet ruincoats
without getting them in the way of
our wct gym towels.

Statesman Set

League Record,
Take Twin Win

State's “Keglers” set a new inter-
collegiate bowling record when all
five of their men rolled a three
game total of better than 500
against ABC. The result was a com-
plete sweep. which when coupled
with their three-game sweep of
Pharmacy last Friday, gives them
a slim one game margin over Stena.
Their respective records are: State.
18 wins 6 defeats. and Siene. 17 wins.
7 defeats.

Don McDonald rated first in the
winning set against Pharmacy. as
he rolled a blasting 224 final game
which gave him a three game to-
tal of 571.

Wednesday night it was a com-
pletely different story as no indi-
vidual bowler stood out. It \-. IS a
team victory in the true sense of
the word.

This was by far State‘s best ef-
fort of the season. ABC's first and
second game totals of 829 and 840
respectively. are usually good
enough to win. but State topped
both of these by a wide margin.
Despite the fact that Don Burt
rolled a 540 triple. Tonkin of ABC
took individual honors for the night
with a 566 triple.

Tomorrow night the winless

BURNS
Peds of State College play host

to the Pratt Institute quintet at Page Hall. Coach Hathaway’s charges
will be out to hang up their initial win of the season in the collegiate
field. The Engineers will enter the fray a slight favorite on the
strength of a six point victory over Maritime.

Wednesday evening the Feds were outscored 85-72 as Bud Lueb-

bert hooped in 41 markers for the

Tangerines of Utica College. This

feat set a scoring record for the Capital District. Paul Carter paced

the l’eds with 21 counters. A seven
21 close game into a decisive victory
in the last minute of play.

State jumped into a five point
lead in the first four minutes as
Bob Brown converted three fouls
and Pete Telfer added a deuce.
Then the talented Luebbert chipped
in with two of his eighteen field
field goals to close the gap. Warden,
Fallek. and Carter hit for successive
buckets to give the Gold a seven
point bulge. Luebbert hit for an-
other pair of hoops and Poleo caged
another. Telfer got a basket to boost
our lead but his efforts went for
nil as Kahler dropped in two long
sets to give Utica a 14-13 lead at the
quarter.

Fallek Scores 0n Lay-up

"Nate" Fullek recovered the lead
for the Feds on a driving lay up. At
this point Luebbert took over and
added six points to the "Utes" total.
A bucket by Captain Jim Warden
knottei the score at 21 all with five
minuth remaining in the first half.
Luebbert broke the stalemate with
three hoops in less than a minute
and a half. A pair of two—pointers
by Kahler stretched the lead to 31-
21. A closing rush by Telfer and
Carter put the half time score at
33-26.

Score Mounts In Third Period

With Luebbert and Kahler of
Uticu and Carter and Fallek of the
home forces hitting consistently.
the score mounted in the third pe-
riod. Carter hit on four out of fivo
shots from the floor with his pet
one—hunder. and Luebbert hit from
the pivot spot on seven out of ten
efforts. The lust period started with
State trailing by a 57-48 margin.

A total of 52 points were scored
in the last ten minutes. A whirl-
wind of baskets by both clubs put
the Tnng‘ertncs on top 71—66 with
three minutes left to play. The Feds
hurt the crowd wild as Carter and
Warden closed the gap to 3 points
with only two minutes left. but here
the ever effective Luebbert broke
away with u five-point spree. The
Stutcsmcn run out of gas as the
Utes pulled away to a hard fought
win.

.lV Loses lly Two Points

The Purple and Gold's Junior
Varsity dropped it thriller to the
’l‘ungcrinc .luyvces by a 51-49 mar-
gin. The loud chunged hands eleven
times in the lust bull in it fast and

point flurry by the visitors turned

to be carried from the floor with a
badly twisted ankle in the second
stanza.

The Feds got off to a very slow
start as they dropped both of their
road games last weekend. Friday
they succumbed to a last minute
rally in bowing to Maritime, 54-49.
At Willimantic on Saturday night,
the boys were victimized by a phe-
nomenal outside shooting average by
the home five. In defeating State
57-49. the “Willies” hit for 85% of
their second half shots.

The red hot Willimantic quintet
overcame a five-point deficit and
won gotng away. Carter had 17 for
the Feds.

State Pulls To Near Tie

At Maritime. a 21-point effort by
Max F‘allek wasn't enough to take
the decision. The home forces broke
through a full court press for two
baskets after State had pulled up to
within one point in the final 30
seconds.
