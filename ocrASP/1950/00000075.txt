Taking a few moments in the PO
to browse over the neWspaper in
the exchange rack, we found some
very humorous anecdotes. Here are
a few excerpts we thought inter-
esting.

The McGill Daily, McGill University

The debate teams at McGill are
most informative and unusual and
the topics are even better, especially
the Arts and Science debate on
the topic: “Resolved: That make-up
is more of a hindrance than a help.”

“The affirmative pointed out that
make-up actually destroys beauty
and ruins health—for instance, ev-
ery time the eyebrows are plucked,
an impulse travels from eye to brain
to heart. where it results in a shock,
so that eventually a heart condition
will result."

Another remark that was found in
The McGill Daily is: “It takes ten
thousand nuts to hold a car together,
but only one to scatter it all over
the countryside."

The New Mexico Daily Lobo,
University of New Mexico

Two students at UNM figured that
it would cost them $8,812.80 by the
time they completed four years at
the University

r

“Do you realize how much it
costs to put one indigent child
through the turmoils of a higher
education? Taking our little black
check book from the shelf which
admittedly. is a good deal less dusty
than the nearby textbooks, we de-
cided to figure our accounts for the
past 40 days. We observed the final
results. Could that be right? It's
impossible.We checked. It was right.
For a brief moment we were stun-
ned. At the rate we are going to
send one of us to school for four
years would cost $8,812.80.”

The Oswegonian — State Teachers
College at Oswego.

An inquiring reporter asked some
students: “How do you feel when
the librarian hushes your chatter?
A few of the answers were: “Li-
brary—l’l What’s that?"; “The li-
brarians make more noise than any-
one else."; and “I smile—She sounds
Just like my Mom."

cil is investigating to see if the stu—
dents can be given more time for
the use of the Lounge.

A report was made by Rae Dionne
‘53. in regard to the reduction of
train i‘nrc accommodations to State

possible to Rochester, Buffalo, and
New York for trips home for the

pany to make these accommodations

these trips outside the Commons at
the desk set up for this purpose.

dent of Student Association and a

Head Educators Adopt Resolution
For Compulsory Military Training

Once again the issue of compul—
sory military training is attracting
nttcntion on the national scene. At
a meeting held Friday, December
7. in New York City the Association
of American Universities adopted a
resolution advocating universal mil-
itary training and service for teen-
:igc youths. The resolution, which
stated that the "military strength
o; the United States may be a vital
factor in the prevention of global
war." was released by Frederick A.
Middlebush, President of the Uni-
versity of Missouri and of the asso-
ciation.

The educators proposed that males

The program for the evening will
include dancing, singing, and re-

Commons will be docked with sprays
of cvci'grccns and rod and green
streamers with a large Christmas
trcc us the ccntcr of attraction. Thc

stnrt service upon reaching the age
of 18 or upon completion of high
school, whichever is later. They must
start service not later than the age
of 19, but if a boy finished high
school at 17, he could volunteer for
induction with the consent of his
parents. The association said that
"the age at which the obligation
must be discharged should be such
as to intoricrc least with the life of
the individual."

Thcy furthcr recommended that
evcn those physically unfit to fight
be taken. The only two exceptions to
straight military service suggested
were three year students already in
collegc who could be deferred to
finish tneir education, and out-
standing inductccs who, at the end
of their basic training, could sus-
pend thcir service to take specialized
training for professions and trades
essential to military needs. Both
groups would be deferred on condi—
tion of future service.

Dr. Evan R. Collins, President of
the Colicgc, declared that “if the
military situation makes necessary
an armed force of three million
men. then it is inescapable, on the
basis of the number of young men
becoming ninctccn in each of the
next several years, that a period of
scrrico of at least two years will be
rcqnircd. This requirement would
make much more difficult the con-
curran responsibility of schools and
colleges to wage the world-wide war
of the mind which is our continu-
ing, long-tcrin obligation."

Jobs Open In Pakistan, Iran

According to a recent announce-

ents may contact Dr. Shaw in Room

Maestro Obliges
As Couples Twirl

Did you hear that sweet music
floating from the Ten Eyck
Saturday night? It wasn’t Harry
James, but Maestro Harry Vin-
cent, his Trumpet and his 0r-
chestra who certainly did quite
a job of making with the melo-
dies at the annual Inter-Frat-
ernity, Inter-Sorority Christmas
Ball.

To many a familiar tune the
gown and dark suit-clad couples
swirled around beneath a color-
ful canopy of balloons. Only
twice was the smooth rhythm of
dancing interrupted. Once with
a badly tom evening gown and
once when a circle formed in
the middle of the floor as one
escort stooped to pick up his
lady of the evening. Even at such
happenings the dancers were
unperturbed.

As the clock crowded two, the
crowd began to thin out. Each
departing couple seemed to take
with it some of the atmosphere
of a memorable “Winteriudc”
and an eventful evening.
