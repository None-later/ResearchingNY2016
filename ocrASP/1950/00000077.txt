Keglers Back

Record Again,
Crush Pharmacy

State’s first place keglers continu-
ed on their way as they SWept three
straight games from Pharmacy on
the Siena college alleys last Wed-
nesday night. As a result of this.
Siena, who took three games from
ABC. is still one game behind State
in the tight race for the Intercol-
legiate League bowling crown.
Mcuonald Paces League Leaders

For the second straight week in
a row. every man on State's league
leading bowling team. recorded a
500 or better triple. Capt. Don Mc-
Donald paced his men with a 551
triple while also taking individual
honors for the night with a 200
first game score. McDonald now
leads the league in individual aver-
ages as his scores of last night rais—
ed his season's average to approxi-
mately 185.

State‘s total pinnage of 2585 is
just two pins less than the league
record they set exactly one week

go.

The first game was a farce as
State swamped Pharmacy by a total
of 208 pins. To illustrate how pitiful
Pharmacy's cause was, only one
man. Kinney. bettercd the blind.
which is 140. The second game
showed little improvement for Phar-
macy as State again ran roughshod
over them. this time by a total of
150 pins. [‘he last game could have
been labeled. “no contest"; State‘s
superiority was never in doubt as
they ended up winning by the tre-
mendous margin of 257 pins.

To Roll Against Siena

The day we come back from our
Christmas vacation. the Feds roll
Siena on the latter‘s home alleys.
This may well be the most crucial
series of the season for State. A
sweep of all three games would
shove State out in front by four
complete games and thereby pro-
vide sort of a cushion for them for
the remaining 12 weeks of the sea-
son.

Beavers Down Things In Thriller;

Rousers Lead
As Potter Club
Loses To 515

The Rousers took over first place
Tuesday as they downed the Splits
in three straight matches by scores
of 617-544. 698-622. and 660-583.
Potter, the first place team last
week. dropped to third as they lost
to SLS in the hardest fought and
best played games of the season.

The Rousers were sparked by their
captain. George Smalling, who rolled
a 425 triple. The games were not
close as no one on the Splits was
able to register a 400 game.

SLS Breaks League Records

The big game of the day which
brought together the two previous
league leaders. Potter and SLS, re-
sulted in a two to one victory for
the sons of Sigma Lambda. High
man for SLS was Oarr with a 542
total. while Kirby with a 504 led the
losers. Three records were broken
by the powerful SLS crew. “Clancy”
Oarr set a new high in season aver-
ages with a 168, Thierran a new
high in individual games with a 199
and the team as a whole bowled a
2416 total. the best all season. With
this fine bowling,r SLS moved into
third place.

Kl)“ Moves Into Second

While this battle for first place
raged, the smooth and well-balanced
KDR boys took over the second
place berth. KDR behind Ken Orn-
er downed the Fearless Five in
three straight by scores of 694-487.
675-658. and 694-573. KDR's record
is now eight and one.

The other strong team of the lea—
gue. the Beavers. beat Thurlow by
scores of 769-615, 835-681, and 755-
651. The big guns here Were Ber-
nard and Deniers with 519 and 495
triples respectively.

The two other games were both
decided by a 2 to 1 margin. In the
first the Jeeps took the Snafus in
the third and deciding game by a
score of 778—696. The two other
scores were 671-627. and 586-634.

The final game between KB and
the Finks saw the Potter farm club
come from behind and take the last
two games by scores of 715-675 and
727-620. They had dropped the first
one by :1 score of 727 to 677.

As of now the SL8 crew is favor—
ed to win the title. They have beat-
en both Potter and the Beavers and
their only threat now is KDR.
However. the Rousers. Potter. and
KDR all have fine bowlers and
promise to keep the league good and
tight.

Annex Topple Favored ReHOps

On Monday night the Beavers
came from behind in the last half
to win their initial contest 35—29
from the Things. The Beavers were
on the short end of 11 13-20 score
at the half. Big Ken Ludluni threw
in 18 points for the winners while
his teammate Lumnnna was hitting
for 6. Sturm pounded the hoop for
18 points in the losing cause. His
one-handers from the side were very
effective in the first half. In other
games K.D.R. swamped the Red-
skins 63—10 and the Angels trounced
the Vcrmontors 44—9.

Just to prove that basketball is
really here to stay and WAA is on
the ball. Saturday WAA was invited
to a play day at Russell Sage along
with Middlebury College.

State's delegates were Joan De-
Vinny. Betty Coykendall. Malvina
Garner. Phil Harris, Martha Nev-
lezer, Evie Erdle. Helen Pilcher, and
Esse Juengling. Although the rep-
resentatives weren't greeted by fur
coats. plaid scarves. and red-knee
socks. they received a hearty wel-
come; tourcd Sage's new activities
building, and warmed up by playing
a bit 0f “tenocourt.” After a. valiant
struggle. State bowed to Sage 32-19
and Middlebury 10-17. Don't let
these scores discourage you. the
season's just begun and “practice
makes perfect!" The spirit is there
and maybe next time State will be
in first place.

tivity. Twirling Club. headed by

help them out—Eat candy—Drink

Now to everyone a merry, merry

see you next year.

 

/Vow- Wad [3"! or;

—By PAUL BUCHMAN

 

There is probably no other sport
that offers more tension and oppor-
tunity for good, substantial nail-
biting, for the spectator. then schol-
astic and/or collegiate wrestling.

Please do not do the “honest to
goodness" wrestlers the injustice of
confusing their ancient and vener-
able sport with that exhibition of
the same name that you watch, from
your favorite easy chair or bar stool.
as the case may be. on television.

Coach Garcia. who is trying,
through the medium of the Wrest-
ling Club, to establish wrestling
here. has done a commendable job
in his freshman year 111 State.
Wrestling Should Be Encouraged

Wrestling should be encouraged
at State for many reasons. First,
although it shouldn't be. wrestling
is primarily a participant rather
than n spectator sport. Secondly.
wrestling is a sport for a small man
as well as the big boys. Competition.
which is divided into eight weight
.‘ivlsions. is thus open to anyone in-
terested in the sport.

There is ill] exceptionally good
possibility of wrestling becoming ll
first-rate sport at State. It is prob—
ably the best sport with the possible
exception of busketbull, in which a
small school can become a major
power. Unless you are a wrestling
fun, you have probably never heard
of Iowa Shite Teachers College. Le-
high. or Cornell College. Yet these
schools consistently rank among
the lenders in collegiate wrestling.

Let‘s hope that State. too. may some

(1in rank among the leaders.

Saturday night the Feds went
down to their fourth straight de-
feat as they bowed to Pratt, 56-53.
The victors were never behind in
the contest as set shot artist Dan
Gigllo hooped 19 points.

Working from a five man weave.
the visitors established a 9-3 lead
at the end of the first quarter. The
statesmen could connect for only two
field goals in the first 11 minutes of
the game. one each by Carter and
Brown. Pratt pulled away to a 21-9
lead as Bunnington and Giglio col-
laborated for five quick baskets.
Don Krug entered the fray at this
stage and became the big cog in a
Purple and Gold scoring flurry. Big
Don hit the nets for 8 points in the
last five minutes of the half. but
the Cannoniers still held a 35-21
lead at the intermission.

The regulars could not regain
their shooting eye as the second
half got underway and Coach Hath-
away inscrted Bill Walker. John
Zongrone. and Krug into the line
up. They responded splendidly. With
Krug dominating both backboards
the Feds began to roll.

In six minutes. this new aggrega-
tion closed a 14 point deficit to 45-
41. "Nate" Fallek hooped a one-
handcr from the side and we trailed
by two. Pratt's Bunnington and
Kennedy retaliated with a couple of
quick deuces as Fallek contributed
three counters to the home forces'
total. A set shot by Zongrone cut
the visitor's lead to 50-48 and pan—
demonium reigned in Page Hall.

The cheers went for nil as Lois
and Welz contributed sets and Bun-
nington a driving lay up to raise
the Pratt margin to 8 points with
three minutes remaining. Brown,
Carter. and Fallek converted free
throws and Taber got a tap-in to
slice the score to 56—53. That's how
it ended as the victors waived three
charity tosses to retain possession
of the ball in the final 45 seconds.

The JV’s dropped their Second
game of the season to a taller Op-
penheim team. 60-54. Tom Hoppey's
23 points paced the Jr. Peds.

of his regulars because of fouls.
Gene Kobylarz and John Leney were
