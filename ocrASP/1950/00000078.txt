Constitutionality Ot Feinberg Law

The on-again, off-again law, the
Feinberg Law, is on again! The con-
stitutionality of this state law,
which bars members of subversive
organizations from employment in
the public school system, was una-
namously upheld November 30 by
the New York State Court of Ap-
peals.

Passed by the legislature in 1949,

 

MAA To Sponsor
Dances Alter Games
According to Ronald Rockhill ’51,
President of Men’s Athletic Associ-
ation, MAA council has made plans
to hold dances after each home
basketball game which occurs on a
Friday or Saturday night. The first

dance will take place Saturday, Jan-
uary 6 in the gym.

Music for dancing, which will last
until 12 midnight Will be supplied by
Don Burt and his orchestra. There
will be an admission charge of $.25
per person. Thomas Hoppey ’54, and
Francis Streeter ’53 are in charge
of the arrangements for the affairs.

the law has twice been declared
unconstitutional by two State Su-
preme Court Justices who were ia-
ter reversed by their Appellate Di-
visions. In the most recent deci-
sion the state's highest tribunal held
that “when in its Judgment and dis-
cretion the Legislature 'finds acts
by public employees which threaten
the integrity and competency of a
governmental service such as the
public school system, legislation ade-
quate to maintain the usefulness of
the service affected is necessary to
forestall such danger."

"Believing the Feinberg Law to
be the Legislature’s answer to such
a need,” the court added, “we find
in that statute no restriction which
exceeds the Legislature's constitu-
tional power."

The Academic Freedom Commit-
tee of the Teachers Guild issued a
statement “rejecting the philosophy
underlying the Court- of Appeals de-
cision.” The statement ended. “We
have opposed the Feinberg Law from
the start and we shall continue 0
fight for its repeal by the Legisla-
ture."
