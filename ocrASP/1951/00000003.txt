the Reserves, National Guard and
have previous experience in the
armed forces are allowod to enter
the advanced courses.

These courses would not eliminate
students from taking physical edu-
cation classes. ROTC courses should
not cut down on electives except for
the advanced students.

In order to assist the college in
determining whether to make an
application for establishment of an
ROTC unit here, and the Air Force
to act on the application, if it is
made, it is requested that every
student in this college answer the
following question: “Do you strong-
ly favor, or favor, or oppose. or are
you indifferent to the establishment
of an Air Force Reserve Officers
Training Corps unit on a permanent
basis at this college?"

Council members. Seniors and other
students absent from Assembly will
receive their ballots through student
mail and are requested to hand them
back immediately to James Jiusto,
President of Student Association.

Concerning present cnlistmenls,
State College has been notified that
under the new policy students en-
rolled ln colleges or universities are
automatically entitled to deferment
for the school year in which they
receive their induction notice.
These students shall be allowed to
enlist in the service of their choice
at any time in the two months im—
mediately preceding the final month
of their school year.

The old policy provided that no
armed service would accept a volun-
tary enlistment after a man had
received notice for his pre-indiic-
tion physical examination. The nevi
policy also states that each SGl'VlCe
will accept enlistmean only to the
extent that places are open for
those who desire to enlist.

Unwelcome Visitor
Howls In Albany

“It was a nice fox, a proper
fox, but one of the roving kind,”
is the Albanian theme song.
Foxes, some rabid, have been
attacking everything from paper
boys to fast moving cars.

Where do the foxes come
from? The Biology Department
has the answer: “from other
foxes."

This whole problem is tied up
with mice. the fox delicacy.
Many mice mean healthy foxes,
which reproduce rapidly. Few
micc "wan undernourished
foxes, an easy prey to diseases.
Ami that‘s the present situation.

What can the fox do? His
mice gone, his in-Iaws starving,
011‘ he goes to the nearest chick—
on coop, snarling at whatever
gets between him and a full
stomach.

So when the knock comes, it
won’t be the wolf at your door.
It'll be famishing, rabid Mr. Fox.

 

Faculty Member
Leaves Position

This week information, through
the Knickerbocker News, was pub-
licized that a faculty member of
State College was relieved of his
duties. The name of the instructor
has not been released.

In an interview, Dr. Evan R. Col-
lins President of the College. veri-
fied the following quote, “There is
nothing in this person's record here
which would prevent me from mak-
ing ii favorable recommendation
for employment in another college.
It Ls one of those cases where a
greater contribution could be made
by the person involved in another
school."

Dr. Collins stated further that it
is not the policy of the college to
make public the names of any
teachers Whose employment at the
college is not to be renewed. "Pub-
lic announcement or discussion of
such cases," he stated, “may well
damage an individual's opportuni-
iics for employment elsewhere. and
injure his professional career, even
though he is a promising teacher.

Dcl‘ines Duties
OI Finance Stall

Myskania has further interpreted
the Student Association Constitution
to ciai'ify the controversy which has
originated in connection With the
requests by certain organizations
that they be allowed to sponsor
money-making projects, according
to William Englehart ’bl, Chairman
of Myskanla. The interpretation is
concerned with the wording of Ar-
ticle III.

'l'lle words blanket fee shall mean
“the student tax lev1ed by and
against the undergraduate student
body.” The payment of the fee en-
titles undergraduates to attend one
periormance, without further cost
of each event sponsored by organ-
izations supported by Student Asso-
ciation.

Same the definition of blanket fee
does not apply to the tax that grad-
uai-c SluuellLS pay, they shall be
limited in their privileges. They will
be allowed to attend one perform-
ance of each event, without further
cost, to receive copies of publica-
tions supported by Student Associa-
tion. They are excluded from the use
of equipment owned by Student As-
sociation or bought with funds ap-
propi‘iatcd by that group; however,
this does not prohibit their attend-
lllg activities in which that equip-
ment is used.

The duties of the Student Board of
Finance were outlined as follows: to
investigate and act upon requests
by organizations for extra funds. to
suggest other means of meeting such
CICllCILS, or if that is not possible to
bring the matter before Student
Association.

The words extra funds have been
interpreted to mean requests from
surplus. The privilege of suggestion
if given to the Student Board of Fi-
nance would necessarily be limited.
Thcy can suggest that funds from
