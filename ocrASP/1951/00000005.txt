'Knous'e To 
Business Course
In Job Interviews

In an article appearing in the
January 1951 issue of Business Edu-
cation World. Reno S. Knouse.
Professor of Commerce, has describ-
ed the use of interview dramatiza-
tions in his classes. Students in
‘Knouse's classeshave been receiving
practical experience in applying for
jabs by participating in job inter-
'views.

After discussing the principles of
the job interview, Knouse con-
tacts personnel directors in local
stores and arranges for interviews
in which his students take part.
These students dramatize the inter-
view before the class and from this
dramatization evolves a discussion
of the techniques of interviewing.

These interviews and the drama-
tization of them will be of great im-
portance in aiding students to suc-
cessfully apply for jobs, Knouse
states. His article observes that the
study of how to apply for a job is
important, but that the student also
needs practice in applying the prin-
ciples he has developed in the study.

Burt Rolls 603

To Help Keglers

Keep League Lead

Handicap New Used
To Help Falling Teams

Looking back over the past few
weeks, State's varsity bowling team
has taken eight out of nine games
including two out of three in their
crucial match with the Stone In-
dians. The best individual perform-
ance this year was turned in by
Don Burt when he rolled a three-
game triple of 603 against Albany
Business College. In doing so, Burt
rolled games of 189, 213 and 201 ro-
spectiveiy.

Handicap Introduced

To make the league more even,
it was decided over the vacation to
convert the present league into a
handicap league. This means that
the poorer teams are given a certain
amount of pins before they ever roll
a ball down the alley and this tends
to make the games closer and give
the weaker team the incentive to
roll better games since they have
a definite chance to win. The way
the amount of handicap is figured
is to take the averages of the com-
petitive teams, subtract them and
then take 75 per cent of this differ-
ence and give it to the weaker
team. Under this set-up, State has
the highest league average and
therefore must give every team a
handicap.

Burt Rolls High

In State’s match with A. B. 0.,
Don Burt paced the team with his
603 triple while McDonald chipped
in with n 536 triple. The first game
of this match was the closest even
though the Feds won by a margin of
35 pins. The second and third games
could have been labeled “no con-
test" as State won each by more
than 100 pins.

State’s next match against Sicna
was the first for either team under
the new handicap league and Sicna
got the better of the deal by being
spotted 11 pins by the Statesman.
Despite this handicap. State swept
the first two games to give them the
league leadership, by a full two
games. Sicna did manage, howovcr,
to salvage the last game and thereby
cut State’s lead to one slim game.
Don Burt and Captain McDonald
again paced State with three game
totals of 559 and 525 respectively.

Margin for State

In Wednesday night's match State
brcczcd through the first two games
even though they had to spot Phar-
macy 113 pins per game. The last
game was as close as it could by.
State won by one pin, 734-733. An
ironicol twist to this match is that
Don McDonald in the last game had
a split and instead of making him
roll, Pharmacy granted him that
one pin which at the time they did
not know was the margin of victory.

,yw pm“, Basketball Quint, Entertaining New Paltn",
Victorious Over Potsdam State, 89-68

By PAUL BUCHMAN

World War III brings new prob-
lems to the SCT sports scene every
day.

Of necessity, the athletic program
for next year will have to be dras-
tically curtailed. Dr. Phinney and
the Student Board of Finance asked
all organizations to keep their bud-
get requests down to 1949-50 levels.
At the same time, costs have risen
for all student activities.

Athletic Supplies Increase In Cost

Costs of athletic supplies have ri-
sen from 20 to 40 per cent. MAA.
in the process of making out the
budget for 1951-52, is faced with
the ogre of still higher prices next
year. As a result, MAA has decided
to cut down on the number of games
to be scheduled for the Varsity and
JV Soccer, Basketball. and Baseball
teams.

A strangely unique and fanciful
“sport” will be inaugurated on
March 1. No athletic ability will be
required. No budget requests will be
made. It's "Ripley-ﬁsh" enough to
be true, however. The athletic dc-
partmcnt of State, on Monday, an-
nounced a new physical development
program for men who will enter
military service in June.

Purpose Is Preparation

The purpose of the newly unveil-
ed program is to prepare the men
who enroll to better “live through"
the 12 week basic training that the
armed services will give the men
while they are in the service. Since
the men will be in top notch condi-
tion when they enter the armed
service, they will be better able to
“shine” during the training period,
and better able to gain promotion.
At least, that is the sought—for goal.

Individualized Program
Fortunately, the program can be
more individualized than a service
program can be. The men will get
more personal attention here to
clean up unique physical weaknes-
ses. Since Conch Hathaway will be
managing the baseball team in the
spring, the "fitness" sessions will

be supervised by Joe Garcia.

Will Meet Outdoors

The meetings will be held out-
doors, regardless of weather. They
will be held from 3:30 to 5:00 p. m.
statesmen will be expected to at-
tend at least 4 out. of 5 of the week-
ly meetings unless special concil—
tions forbid this.

Registration for the new activity,
which will be limited to about. 30
men. will begin Monday morning in
the Physical Education oil‘icc. Any
interested men are encouraged to
sign citl‘ly. Most of the returned vet-
erans have indicated that a program
of this type is what they would have
liked to have had before they enter-
ed military service in the last war.

Strauss Beats Plautl Oi ABC,
Takes First Intercollegiate Match

Ted Strauss. Slate’s three-year
ping pong chomp. defeated Patti
Plautz, A.B.C.'s champ in the first
intercollegiate ping pong match of
1951, Strauss won with scores of
21-16. 21--1ii, and 21-13 in three
consecutive games. A return match
will be scheduled later this month.

 

Race For Show

in lM Pin War

5L5 Adds To Laurels;
Carr Bowls 231 Game

After a two week lay off the IM
Bowling League resumed action at
Rice Alleys. Competition was very
keen, for with only two weeks left
all teams knew Just how many
games they would have to win in
order to gain a good place in the
final standings.

Potter in Second Place

"the btst example of this closeness
is the race for second place between
Potter (,iuo no.1 the Beavers. Potter
found little opposition in the Sun-
iu's as they won by scores of 754-
596, 829—717, and 746-632. The big
gun in the Potter attack was Rock-
hill who come thru with a 220 game.
It was really needed too. for in the
some match Campbell smashed the
maples for n 203.

Meanwhile, Lou Bernard was join—
ing the 200 clue as he led 3 straight
wins over the Rousers. His 207 in
the middle game helped the Beav-
ers register their second highest
score of the year, a 701. The scores
for the three games were 730-585,
761-647. 747-622.

KB Wins by Margin

Closest game of the week was in
the KB-KDR mrics. The first game
was decided by one point 658-657,
with KB getting the nod. After
this KB ran uimy with the last
two games with scores of 748-611
and 702-686.

Although not important in the
league standings, some very fine
games were played by the bottom,
but evenly matched teams. The
Jeeps nuumgcd to take 2 out of 3
from the Fiilks, but this was mainly
(lite to the use of a blind. In the
two games they won, the Jeeps em-
ploycd two blinds, but when one of
their rcuilurs showed up, he was
only able to bowl :1 93. It is becom-
ing evident that the blind in the
league is too high, as 1 out of every
7 men are below blind average.

The other minor series rcsultcd
in a clean sweep for the resurgent
Saints. Spai'kcd by Ted Marro‘s 197
they took the Fearless Five by scores
of 663—595. 724—611, 700-605.

SLS 'I‘ops League

The final group of games saw
81.8. the league leaders down the
very weak Splits. The high point
oi this series was Onrr's two game
total of 4127 featuring a 231 single
game. This score insured the power-
ful SLS team of first place in the
men‘s high singles and high triples.
This font. ulon; with the high team
single, triple, and average is one of
the most. outstanding accomplish-
ments of any Fraternity in IM bowl-
mg.

Soph Sports Writer
Departs For Navy

State College News Sport’s
staff lost one of its bright-
est sophomores to Uncle Sam’s
Navy. Dave Thomas, popular
Red Devil sports writer, left on
January 23rd for Great Lakes
Naval Training Station to start
his four year enlistment. Dave
received his appointment to the
News Staff in September, 1950.

Dave was quite an athlete at
Condor High School where he
started six man football and
baseball. In football, during his
senior year, Dave was selected
as one of the outstanding play-
ers of the Southern Tier.

At State, he participated in
intramural bowling, basketball,
football, and softball. Also, he
was active in Rivalry, playing
basketball with the Red Devils
and coaching their football
team.

We are sure everyone connect-

WAA is starting the new semester
off with a bang, by playing hostess
to Russell Sage, Skidmore, and
Saint Rose colleges at a basketball
sports day, Saturday. The girls with
the sneaky sneakers will register at
11 a. m., loosen their limbs during
general practice from 11:30 to 12:30,
stcill a snack in the cafeteria and
commence competition in the gym
about 1:15. Fighting for State will
be Appostolldes, Erdle, Kamke,
Marks and Fuller, forwards, and
DcViuny, Dionne, Skidmon, Jueng-
ling, and Coykcndall, guards. All
you ladies who aren't playing this
time, it‘s a terrific chance to see
some good games, meet new people,
and show our guests that State is
really a l'ricndy school.

From all reports the Pearl Primus
program Tuesday night was worth
$1.20 and the trip to Troy.

In case any 01 you kids are won-
(lcring about your basketball credit.
the list is up on the WAA bulletin
board. Thanks to Captain Joan
Haggcrty. The new leagues started
second semester competition Tues-
day night.

As a parting suggestion, the wa-
ter‘s fine every Tuesday night at
the Jewish Community Center, so
why not take advantage of the mon-
ey WAA invested and take a swim.

Walker, Brown
Lead Victory

Tomorrow night at 8:30 the
Feds of State College will be out to
avenge an early season loss to New
Paltz. The visitors won a thrilling
overtime encounter, 61-59, when
these two clubs met early in Janu-
ary. This game was decided at the
foul line as the Hathawaymen con-
verted 5 out of 14 and the visitors
rang up 15 for 27. Bill Walker’s 14
points paced State while Manzi and
McMann hooped 15 apiece for New
Paltz in the first game.

Last night the Purple and Gold
engaged Utica College away. The
Utes, who won the 'l‘ri-City Tour-
nament last month, are noted for
their all out defensive style of play.
Bud Luebbert set a new Page Hall
scoring record of 41 points while
leading UC to a 85-72 victory over
State in the season's home opener.

Set. Offfensive Record

Last Saturday, before a sparse
gathering in Page, the Feds ran
rampant over a bewildered Potsdam
State quint, 89-68. This was a new
all-time high for any Hathaway-
coached team. This feat gives us a
won-lost record of 2-9. Every man
on the varsity played and scored in
this free scoring battle. Bill Walker
and Bob Brown collaborated for a
34 point total; 18 by the former and
16 by the latter. Capt. Jim Warden
and Malcolm Fallek also hit the
double figures, with 10 and 11 points
respectively. Bill Walsh led the visit-
ing Dutchmen with 14 tallies.

A total of (i7 fouls were called and
76 charity tosses awarded in this
fracas. The home forces were guilty
of 28 infractions, but were given 43
free throws, of which they con-
verted 25 successfully. Potsdam was
victimized by the whistle-happy
refs on 38 occasions and they were
forced to play the last five seconds
with only four men as six of their
10 men were ejected on personals.
The visitors made good on 20 of
35 attempts from the fifteen-foot

ne.

Itcscrves Score Freely

The locals led 39-36 at halftime
and ran away from their opponents
shortly after the second half got
underway. Consistent scoring by
Brown, Walker, and Fallek opened
up a thirteen point sprea as the
game entered the last period. In an
effort to close the gates of mercy,
Coach Hathaway flooded his lineup
with reserves. These eager hoopsters
looked very good as they ran the
opposition into the floor while
ringing up twenty-eight points.

 

Real-Hot Junior Varsity Quintet
Plays Host To Skidmore College

In a preliminary contest at 7:15
in Page tomorrow, State's talented
JV squad plays the Skidmorc Ex-
tension quintet. In this season's
previous encounter, played at Glens
Falls, the Jr. Pods had to come from
behind to oek out a hard-fought
57-50 victory.

Last night the squad travelled
to Utica seeking their sixth consec-
uilvc victory and their tenth in
thh'tccn starts. The boys were out
to avenge the sci-buck handed them
by the ’I‘angerinc JV in the season's
opener, 51-40.

I'Inglehort and Garcia Excel

Instrumental in the team's suc-
cess this season has been the fine
work of Couches Bill Englchort and
Joe (lurciu. Molding a green team
into a fine, co-ordlnotcd outfit,
lhcy have (tone it fine job. The boys
themselves have displayed fine spir-
ll uud hustle throughout the sea-
son.

John Ccnlura, the team's leading
general practice from 11:30 to 12:30.
Giordano havo done sparkling work
in setting up plays. Jim Bennett,
ilank Hull. and Art Goldin have
boards
for State's fast-breaking JV squad.
Not to be forgotten are the spirited

reserves who, thus far this season,
have been able to fill in capany for
the starters, helping the team over
the rough spots in the schedule.
Conquer Middletown 72-59

Last Saturday the Jayvees out-
classed a smaller Middletown squad
72-59. Led by Centura’s 21 points,
the team was never in much
trouble, both boards being con-
trolled by Englehart's charges. Ca-
wicn, with 10 points, was high for
Middletown.
