STAT! COLLEGI NIWS. FRIDAY. FEBRUARY .. 1"1

Marriage Lectures Will Answer Jobs Available
Query, ’Are You Really In Love?’ In Civil Service

So you’re going to be married,
huh? Think you can handle the
little woman? Want to know how
to avoid the rolling pin? The Al-
bany YMCA and YWCA are spon-
soring their third annual series of
lectures on education for marriage
which are designed to aid you to
love and honor. The lectures are
advertised as "A down-to-earth
course for your own personal ad-
justments whether you are engaged
or recently married or whether you
simply want to have a better un-
derstanding of the opposite sex.”

The lectures will take place on
five consecutive Tuesday evenings at
7:30 p. in. at 423 State Street. Those
wishing to attend must register for
the entire course at a fee of $1
to Y members and $2 to non—mem-
bers.

Are you really in love? Now,
there's a good question. It and oth—
ers will be discussed February 13 in
a lecture entitled “How To Be Hap-
py In Marriage."

Money seems to be the big prob-
lem today. If any of you recently
married men have found your purse
strings tied in knots you might drag

fraunu

the wife down to the February 20
lecture and learn not only how much
money is needed for a marriage, but
who will spend the money and how
it will be spent.

The ail-important questions of
how to avoid friction and arguments
and how two strong independent
personalities can live together will
be discussed in “The Give and
Take of Marriage" on February 27.
Here is your chance to bury the
hatchet, forget the old feuds and
avoid the impending ones.

With inter-faith marriages be-
coming more and more common the
March 6 lecture “Where Does Re-
ligion Come In” should be of great
interest. The discussion will con-
cern itself with the spiritual nature
of marriage and the practical as-
pects of religion in the home.

The series will end on March 13
with a lecture aimed at helping
young couples to understand their
emotional and sexual differences
and to achieve proper attitudes to-
wards each other.

With ali the recent college mar-
riages State should turn out quite
a crop of enthusiastic attendees.

The New York State Civil Ser-
vice Commission announces several
positions open to the public. No
written examinations will be held
for these positions, but candidates
will be judged on previous training
and experience.

These jobs fall into two main gen-
eral categories: medicine and edu-
cation. Salaries range from a max-
imum of $6700 dollars to a minimum
of 2898 dollars per year. There will
be five annual salary increases varv-
ing in accordance with the basic
salaries.

Specifically, these include patho-
logical positions, physicians, both
senior and junior, surgeons, and
nursing instructors. The position in
the educational field is that of cor-
rective institution teacher.

Students interested in any of
these positions may secure detailed
information about specific duties by
writing the State Department of
Civil Service, Albany.

Application blanks may also be
secured from the department. Stu-
dents should submit these blanks to
the above address before February
17.

the surplus be appropriated to the
organization with a deficit. How-
ever, if there is no surplus they can
suggest that a supplement to the
student tax be appropriated. In
either case they can advise Student
Association to view the request with
disapproval.

According to the Constitution, “all
monies earned" by any organization
over its approved budget must be
returned to surplus for administra-
tion. Therefore. an organization
simply gains for itself a better bar-
gaining position when it requests an
appropriation.

VOL. XXXV NO. I!

Sororities To Honor Freshmen '
With Suppers, Formal Dinners

 

Mathews Lists

Delense Plans,
Drill Regulations

Elmer C. Mathews. Director of
Civil Defense for the college, has
released information to the faculty
concerning atomic defense. There
instructions will be read to the in-
dividual classes since each class-
room offers an individual problem.
Rules concerning the Commons and
Lounge have been listed, and Mat-
heWs will address the assembly Fri—
day, February 23, about the clearing
of the auditorium.

There are two kinds of attack
with which the rules are concerned.
The first is a sneak or unexpected
attack. The first indication of an
actual sneak attack will be a sud-
den burst of light which will be no—
ticed even on the brightest of days.
For drill purposes the signal for
a sneak attack will be two short and
one long ring repeated twice on the
passing bells. The second kind of
attack is the warned attack. In this
case the college will receive a warn-
ing of an impending atomic attack.
The signal for the warned attack will
be four short rings on the passing
bells repeated three times. The all
clear will be indicated by repeated
long rings. The first drill. to be
held this month, will be a warned
drill. Thereafter, a drill will be hcld
each month until the end of the
year.

Students who are not in a class-
room arc to be responsible for fol—
lowing the defense plan. The Com-
mons is one place for student re-
sponsibility. If a student is in the
lower Commons, he should remain
there taking stations along the walls
and beneath the windows. The peo-
ple on the balcony will move out
of the door keeping to the right.
and taking positions along the walls
of the lower pcrlstylc as far as
the entrance of Draper. Students in
the Draper baseman will clear the
corridors quickly by moving into the
men and women‘s locker rooms tak-
ing positions shielded from windows
and doorways. Students in tho
Loungc mid Cafeteria will take po-
sitions along the walls and under-
neath the windows, and along the
walls of the dining room respect—
ively.

 

Book Sales Lose
To Cars, Heaters

Do you have a cold apart-
man with no central heating?
If you do, there is an adver-
tisement on the bulletin board
opposite the girls’ locker room
which is ready made for you.
Buried deep undcr notices for
books for sa'e, it offers a heat-
er which will “on low, throw
enough heat to warm it three
or four rtom apartment and on
high, will drive you out of the
house.“

But perhaps you don’t have
an apartment, cold or other-
wise! In that case, to the left
of if e liozik noticcs is an ad for
an apartment Whlth might in-
terest you. However, no children
are allowed. and it is suggest-
cd that you have a car because
bus service, is poor.

You don't have a car? Again
the lnilctin board can soch
your problem with notices up to
scli a 1036 [Buick and a liilil
Plymouth. If you can't afford a
car there is a pair of ice skates
for sale which might be of help.
