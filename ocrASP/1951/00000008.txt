Cit-Beaten Hoopsters
 For Two cantests

 Connecticut
 Plattsburgh

The staggering basketball forces
of State College throw out the wel-
come mat to Willimantlc State and
Plattsburgh State this weekend. To-
night they engage the quintet from
the Nutmeg state and tomorrow
they will make an appearance
against the boys from Northern
New York. In both of these encoun-
ters the home forces will carry their
usual underdog rating. The “Willies”
beat State 57-49 in their first meet-
ing this year. The Northmen did
likewise ';y the sliln margin of 58-56.

Last Thursday our one game win-
ning streak was snapped by Utica
College, 55-40. The Purple and Gold
could not find the range in the first
half and were on the short end of
a 31-16 score at the intermission.
The second half was listless as the
Feds played the Utes even. Frosh
ace Bill Walker scored 10 points for
the Statesman before being forced
out of the fracas with an injured
ankle. Carl Luebbert and Dan Car-
rol meshed 14 and 13 respectively
for the winners.

Lose Thriller To New Paltz

The Hathawaymen made a great
last minute bid for victory against
New Paltz Saturday night before
bowing 61-59, on a pushshot by
Manny Yris in the last three sec-
onds. The Feds trailed by 6 points
with four minutes to play and closed
the gap to one as Max Fallck. State‘s
high scorer with 19. tossed in two
quick hoops and John Zongrone
contributed a foul point. A hook
shot by Jake Miller put the visitors
up by three. Bob Hallsner hit with a
set and a charity toss to knot the
score at 57 all. Lou Mahar broke
through the Purplc's defense for" a
quick lay up. A foul shot by Jim
Warden cut ilic deficit to one. The
home team‘s chances looked nil as
Failck and Zongi‘one missed free
throws in the closing minute. With
38 seconds to play. Zongrone was
awarded a free throw; he converted
to even matters at. 50-59. The New
Pnltz tclim calmly worked the ball
around the floor till the final sec-
ends when Yris cllt by Hausner for
his game winning bucket.

To the, Editor:

Early in thc school year the sill-
dents llt state were told that they
didn‘t have ally spirit when it come
to varsity athletics. However, now I
can truly say that while there isn't
as much spirit as there should bc~
thcl'c are a lot of students who pack
Page Hall for every game and knock
thcnlsclvcs out — ovcn when their
tcnln is far behind.

1 have seen all of State's home
and away games, except for two
road games. and I can proudly say
that we at State have as much spirit.
if not more than. all our opponcnts
put togctilcr. Why? I can‘t answer
thlitmno one can. But tllc fans are
bclng cheated! They are supporting
the team the best they can. Is the
Loom supporting Lllt‘lll'r‘ No! I don't
nlcllu that. the players urcn‘i‘ play-
in: their hcurts out and playing to
thc bcst of tlicil' ability, bill, the
fililci‘ciil'c bctwccli a winning and a
losing icuin (cspcciaily lll ll close
gumc and we have had ollr share
of thcm: look at last week's game)
is an overt tcum spirit. At Siiitn it
is totally tucking. The "Feds" have
no natural lcadcr. No playinakcr.
No ill'c. The "bench" is as (load as
ihc woodcn bench ihcy sit on. May-
be they do have the spirit but thcy
Siil't' don't show it. and until thcy
do and start fighting for the vic-
torics. they will win only against a
t-olnplctclv olliclu"scd team or one
with loss spirit~if possible.

Our fans developed a spli'ltwii‘s
not too into for the team to do the

slime—it's never too late.

JV Rally Falls
Short, Streak
Ends Al Seven

An unorthodox defense and a de—
cidedly on night for the Junior
Peos, coupled with home court offi-
ciating brought to an end the team's
seven game winning streak at Delhi
Wednesday night. Tied at the half,
22 all, State was able to score only
seven points in the third quarter to
Delhi‘s thirteen. and the Bronco's
never relinquished this lead, finally
winning 49-47. During the last min-
utes of the contest the JV’s drew to
within one point on two occasions,
but lacked the final drive to forge
ahead.

Delhi successfully employed a col-
lapsible zone, using three men on
the outside in a man for man de-
fense. and the other two men back
to block up the keyhole. Despite this
elaborate defense, if Engelhart‘s
charges would have hit with their
normal consistency the story may
have been different. The team hit
for only 15 out of 25 foul shots.

The Junior Varsity started its
streak against Delhi last semester
and beat Oppenheim, Mllham,
Cobleskill, Middletown, Utica, and
Skidmore before finally being halt-
ed. The season's overall won—lost
record now stands at. 11 and 4.

The squad plays host to LaSaile
tonight. and is away for an encoun-
tcr with the Union College Frosh on
Saturday.

the best that can be deVis'ed to meet   I 

the conditions. The first .team that
plays intramural basketball on a
given night picks up the equipment
from the athletic office. The last
referee brings the equipment back
to the office, and locks the door.

The System Doesn’t Work

The system however, doesn’t work.
Too often, more so last year, for-
tunately, than this, the office where
equipment is kept is found locked
when the men are ready to start
play. If, however, the equipment is
secured in good order, the door, for
some strange reason, to the gym
equipment office is found locked.
The person stuck with the equip-
ment has two alternatives: to take
the equipment home, or to leave it
in the gym. Guess what they do?

The specific problem that evolves
out of this situation is the constant
loss of equipment. In the past two
nights of intramural play (Monday
and Tuesday) a whistle and a bas-
ketball have disappeared.

The logical (but improbable) sol-
ution lies in appointing a paid intra-
mural manager who is present at
all intramural basketball activity
and is kept responsible for equip-
ment and the other details of league
play.

A Second Problem

The second problem, a more minor
one, that has become obvious is that
of refereeing. The problem is not
of quality, because intramural play-
ers have become calloused to inade-
quate refereeing. The big beef is
that of consistency. On one night,
a team will be refereed by an offi-
ial who “calls ’em as he sees ’em."
In another game, the same team
will run against a referee who calls
as few as possible, for reasons
which are diverse and devious and
which we will not question here.
Hence, there is no standard of ref-
ereeing. and a team has a logical
gripe when they play a loose. sloppy
game one night; yet the next night.
when they expect the same type of
refereeing. they find themselves in
a constant parade to the foul line.

A possible solution is to ask the
men in the officiating class to ref-
eree intramural basketball games.

germ DAILY AT 8A.M..

The SLS bowling team looked as

if it Was going to bowl itself right
out' of first place Tuesday when
.they only scored a 648 in the first
of their 3 game series with the
Saints. Although there was no
denying that the hard fighting and
fourth place Saints bawled'a good
game for their twelfth straight win,
one must take into account the fact
that 3 of the SLS men bowled be-
low 120, or blind average. Star of
this game was Red McCormick with
a 195 for the Saints. However, Red
was not able to maintain this
standard and Oarr, SLS's best point
getter, came through with the nec-
essary punch as he split the maples
for 198 and 205 in the next two
matches. These two fine scores were
just the things the Sigmas needed
to get them rolling and they took
the last two games both by over a
hundred points. The scores were
648-765, 781-677. 860-746.

Potter, enouraged by the Saints
win, took three straight games from
the Finks by scores of 792-602, 719-
713, 839-679. The big gun of this
series was Walsh With a 196 single
and 522 triple.

Jeeps Use But 3 Men

The weirdest group of games was
between KB and the Jeeps as the
Jeeps used but three men to KB’s
seven. The Beta-men took all three
gains and jumped up into fourth
place over the Saints. The scores
wore 681-628, 710-618, and 690-649.

Closest series of the day was the
KDR-Rousers match, whose three
game total differed by only 19
points. The Manning-men took the
first game by 32 points, the score
being 684-652. However, consistent
bowling took the next two contests
for the Rousers by scores of 734-700
and 683-666. H I 

With the Fearless Five forfeiting
to the Splits there was only one
more series. This was won by Thur-
low as they trounced the Splits by
the scores of 700-617, 716-614, and
716-608. The two most outstanding
individual scores were Coons' 513
triple and Paul Ward's tremendous
126 single.

At present SLS holds 8. slim one
game margin over Potter Club and
since these two do not meet again,
the final standings will depend on
the other league teams bowling
.‘gainst them.

As you probably have heard via
