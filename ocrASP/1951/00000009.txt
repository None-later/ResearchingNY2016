ette Zelanis ’51 is General Chair-
man. The traditional “BZ Heaven"
will be featured in the Formal Din-
ner. General Chairman is Harriet
Juengling '52.

Phi Delta will hold an “Interna-
tional” Buffet Supper. Margaret
Smythe ’52 is General Chairman.
The Formal Dinner will have a
"Showboat" theme with Mary J.
Sweet ’52 as General Chairman.

The sororities have appointed en-
tertainment committees. Entertain-
ment will be furnished at both the
Buffet Supper and Formal Dinner.

Those invited will be called 'for' at
their place ‘of residence. Albany
commuters Will be escorted to the
sorority from their homes. other
commuters will be called for at one
of the dormitories.

The waiters at the Buffet Supp-
ers and Formal Dinners will be
statesmen, both freshmen and up-
perclassmen. statesmen will also act
as taxi drivers for some sororities.

“Do you want an Air Force
ROTC unit'here?” The result
of the poll was not quite as
strong as it would be to the ,ln-
qulry “Should all statesmen be
exempt from the draft?" but
let’s not be optimistic. Men are
receiving their notices every day.

With more than 75 per cent
of the student body voting (the
rest couldn’t bear to face it)
the opposition popped up with
the enormous number of 24.
The uniforms couldn’t have any
attraction. Probably the 76 who
checked “indifferent” haven’t
given up hope of being 4F.

With 572 “strongly favors"
and 301 "favors" it seems that
statesmen (and women) have
become military minded, even
as a matter of necessity. The
poll showed that. State wants an
ROTC unit, but now comes the
hard job of trying to get one
set up here. It’s all up to the
administration and the Air
Force officers who decide the
location of the ROTC units.

’Shode Downers'
Don Fancy Titles

“Atomic Bomb, crouch and
cover," “This is it kids, every
man for himself!” These were
among the statements that State
faculty members promised to ut-
ter, should Albany be a victim
of that attack for which we’ve
been preparing. Another profes-
sor feels that if an atom bomb
falls in the vicinity all will be
a purely academic question any-
way.

In Commerce classes students
decided that persons assigned to
the task of shade pulling should
have distinctive titles, since they
might be the ones to save our
lives. Among the titles consider-
cd were Atom Aides, G. P. S. P.
(Glass Protection Spattcring
l‘crsoncll, and the A. S. S.
[Atom Service Staff).

Not to be pessimistic, but one
facility member is cxpounding
upon the theory that after an
attack, one either gets up and
walks away, or one doesn‘t!
