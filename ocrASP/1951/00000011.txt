Peds To Meet Oneonta

For the first time in a long while
the Purple and Gold will enter a
game in the favorites role as they
play host to Oneonta State tonight.

It is the initial meeting of these
two clubs and State will be award-
ed the edge on a two fold basis.
First. their recent explosive scoring
ability on the home floor. Since the
mid-semester the Hnthawaymen
have averaged 81 points in taking;
three out of four on the Page Hall
hardwoods. Second. the visitors have
lost 3 regular starters clue to scho-
lastic difficulties. Forward Chuck
Mitchell and guards Joe Albany and
Leo Hollenbcck have hung up their
shoes in favor of studies. according
to the Binghamton Press.

On Wednesday night, the Feds
play host to Harpur College. In a

banians 76-67.

Set Scoring Record in Page

Last Friday the rejuvenated Pods
steamrolled Willimantic 95-70. They
exploded for 52 points in the first
half on the sensational rebounding
and sharp shooting of Jim Warden
and “Nate” Fallek. Warden contrib-
uted 13 counters in this period and
dominated both backboards. Fallek
netted 16 tallies. eight from the
charity line, in this offensive spec-
tacle.

After the intermission. the home
forces didn't cool off one bit as they

possibility of hitting the charmed
100 point circle at Hathaway's subs,
led by John Allasio, broke the
scoring record of 89 with six min—
utes remaining. These hopes were
ruled out as the pace of the game
was deliberately slowed down by the
visitors who ironically enough had
beaten Danbury College 100-64
three nights previous.

Peds Come from Behind to Win

The following evening against the
Pinttsburgh Cardinals the Purple
and Gold twice picked themselves
off the floor to rally and tie the
score in regulation time and win
the game. 82-81. in overtime. Led
by Bob Brown and Bill Walker, the
locals raced to a 43-35 half time
lead.

At the start of the second half,

the Peds tried a deep freeze in an
effort to force the visitors out of
their zone defense. This slowdown
activity crimped the locals high
scoring offense as they mustered
only eight points in the third stan-
za and trailed 54-51. In a hectic
last ditch rally the Purple and Gold’s
John Allasio tossed in a two pointer
with 25 seconds to play and then
he stole the leather at half court,
drove in to knot the score, 74-74, as
the final buzzer sounded.

In the overtime period. baskets
by Garrow, McCarthy. and Sears of
the visitors put the Feds six points
in arrears. Warden and Brown got
hoops and Sears a free throw to put
the locals three points down. With
less than 40 seconds to play Paul
Carter dribbled through for a bas-
ket. In an effort to freeze the ball

PAGI I

. In Role Of Favorites

the visitors made an errant pass
and the Feds took the sphere with
16 seconds to play. A one hand
heave by Carter meshed the nets
2 seconds before the final gun to
give State their second win in a row
and probably their most thrilling
victory in many a moon.

Dan Garrow of the visitors snared
the scoring laurels with a 26 point
performance while his teammates
Sears and Baldasorri hit for 17 and
15 respectively. State had six men
in the double figures. Bob Brown
gave the finest shooting exhibition
of his three year career as he caged
eight out of nine shots from the
floor. Brownie led our offense with
17 points. Other Peds denting the
hoop for the double figures were
Carter, Warden. Walker, Fallek.
and Kaehn.

Potter Romps,
Retains IM Lead,-
Angels Unbeaten

Chopping down the Beavers by
a 24 point spread on Monday night,
Potter Club retained leadership in
the American League. With “Easy
Ed" Matthews who garnered 14
points. the men from lower State
Street completely controlled the
“point spread.“ For the losers,
anpmrin hooped in six. The final
score of 46-22 makes it seem as
though a bull handling game was
stressed. but actually the Potter
club then were not playing their
usual fine ball.

The Angels continued on their
unbcutcn skcin as they were award—
ed il 2-0 forfeit win over the Rams.
The Angels are now a game and a.
half over the second place 81.8 out-
fit.

The third game of the evening
however. will long remain in the
1M record books as one of the
weirdest of the season. Previous to
this contest. the Redskins had uv—
crngcd but 18 points it game and
the Remote expected little. if any.
trouble. The Redskins had other
ideas though and with Bonuhue mid
(liainatteo showing the “'lly, racked
up 33 points. Although this lacked
llll‘Ct‘ points of beating the Remote.
there is no doubt it guve the Red-

'_‘ Pharmacy Bows

To Second Place
Siena Keglers

State’s varsity bowling team gain-
cd valuable ground as a result of
their three wins over ABC while
Siena could manage to take only
two out of three from Pharmacy.
Wltll just three weeks left in
league competition, State now has
a three game spread over the Siena
Indians. During this time State has
five matches to roll but only meets
its toughest opponent, Siena, in one
match. This means that the pres-
sure is definitely on Siena and not
on the Feds, as it recently has been.

Carmin Corsl set a blistering pace
in the first match as he rolled a
neat 224. In this game. Corsl did
not miss marking in any frame and
compiled a total of seven strikes.
Spotting ABC 11 four mark handi-
cap i37 pins to be exact), the
Stiitcsmen finally caught up with
ABC in the seventh frame and then
rcully poured it on as they won go—
ing away by a total of 106 pins.

in the second game, the Feds
started lust and never were in
trouble even though the final score
indicated it. was it much closer game
than the first match. One of the
highlights of this game occurred in
thc second frame when Frank Cas-
scttii come through iiud mndc u. very
dil'l‘iult 4-10 split. Corsl again led
Slutc's uttiick but this time had to
shore honors with McDonald as
thcy rolled gumcs of 203 and 200
respectively,

’l‘cusion mounted in the last
frame of the third game as State
lcd by oiily two marks in the last
frumc und Sicnn was being beaten
on the next ullcy in u game which
was also in the lust frame. Four of
State's lcnm marked in the lust
frame to insure victory for them.
but Siena (lid not fore as well and
wound up on the short end by 11
pins. At first it was thought that
Sicnu hud lost, by only 1 pin but
u recheck proved lhul it Wis 11
pins.
