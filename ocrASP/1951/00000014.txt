Will Sponsor
Theatre Exhibit

An exhibition prepared by the edi-
tors of LIFE, entitled “Theater—-
From Ritual to Broadway,” will be
on view on the second floor of Dra.
per beginning Wednesday, and con-
tinuing through Tuesday, March 20,
according to Martha Downey '51,
President of Dramatics 55 Art Coun-
cil. The exhibition undertakes to
suggest some of the reasons—reli-
gious and social—for theater’s per-
ennial and universal appeal.

Twenty-five panels (including one
devoted to a meticulous documenta-
tion of all the illustrations) make
up the display. After an introduct-
ory panel suggesting something of
the variety of places of theatrical
performance, the exhibition opens,
with a section on The Beginnings
of Theater. The second second sec-
tion deals with Tragic Theaters. Six
panels will make up this section dea-
ling with Greek tragedy and Shape-
spearean tragedy.

The Perennial Life of Comedy is
the over-all title of the third sec-
tion, while the final section is con-
cerned with the Theater in the Mo-
dern World. This last section of the
exhibition begins with Ibsen and
Chekhov, fathers of Contemporary
drama, and includes pictures from
many current productions.

The text for the exhibition was
written by Francis Fergusson, who
wrote the distinguished critical
study, The Idea of a Theater.

Varsity Bowlers
Advance Toward

League Crown

Casseita Hits 243 Game
As Keglers Whip Siena

The Varsity Bowling Team widen-
ed their league lead to five full
games over Siena by victimizlng the
Green Indians in two of three
matches bowled Wednesday night.

The Ped keglers captured the first
and third games with scores of 895—
821 and 908-824. Slena piled up an
impressive 942 pins to State's 842
to take the middle encounter.
Frankie Cassetta and Don McDon-
ald paced the victors with triples
of 582 and 568 respectively. Cassette
had a 243 in the third game to set
a new seasonal high for the
league.

Stale Holds League Records

This accomplishment gave State
a monopoly on three league records.
Cassetta‘s game is the High Single,
Don Burt holds the High Triple of
603, and Don McDonald holds the
triple of 596 and a 547 effort
high triple of 596 and a 547 effort
by Harbeck kept the boys from Lou-
donville in contention.

State has three matches left to
roll with the second division clubs,
ABC and Pharmacy. and needs only
five wins to insure the League
Crown. These encounters will not be
rolled off until after the Easter Va-
cation because of the NCIT Basket-
ball Tournament.

Elmira Tourney

For the first time in the history
of the College, the Varsity will car-
ry its colors into the New York
State Bowling Tournament at El-
mira, on April 7-8. The Purple and
Gold keglers have a good chance
to cop some of the prizes on the
strength of their steady team aver-
age and the handicap they will be
allotted under the tournament rul-
ing. The statesmen also have the
advantage of seasoning, as Carmen
Corsi and Frank Cassette will be
bowling on their home alleys.

“Climb up to your ivory tow-

Feel like soaring to great

Once there, you’ll see a dra-

green-walled rooms. There’s ev-
en a cosy nook for storing ra-

If you’re more arty than sci-

Moore Asks Hike

in Teachers’ Salaries

A proposal to increase teacher
salaries was presented to the Legis-
lature Tuesday by the Moore Com—
mittee. Virtually all minimum salary
scales for teachers would be in-
creased by $500 and teachers would
be grinned a $100 cost-of-llvlng
bonus for the present school year.

State aid to education would be
increased by $20.5 million and would
replace the schedule set up by the
1947 Feinbcrg Law. In small school
districts the new starting salary
would be $2500 with increments re-
sulting in a maximum of $4600 after

sixteen years. Limits are now
$2000 lllltl $4100. Higher scales are
recommended for New York City

and cities of over 100,000 population.

In all cuscs minimums would be
higher for teachers with thirty
hours of approved graduate train-
mg.

The propOsal has been endorsed
by the New York State Teachers’
Association.
