“I guess my biggest thrill was the
accomplishment of one of those rare
things—a spare the hard way, 7-10.
Guess I've been a bit lucky in all
my bowling though.”

Catch the guy . . . luck! Sure. and
it must have been luck that brought
him a 260 game in American Bowl-
ing Congress league competition. It
must also be luck that is bringing
him the highest lcnguc average in
State varsity bowling games.

Nowhere docs State's “Ned Day"
mention at little asset called skill.
Being one of the "knock-’em-down,
sct-‘em-up-aguln“ boys is nothing
new to him. He had three years of
ABC competition under his bowling
ball and on his score sheet before
entering State.

Also the mere fact ihut he was
practically raised on bowling balls
and ten-pins this dud owns nllcys
back homci has much to do with
his love for the game.

QUITE A FELLOW

The varsity bowling squiul's cup-
tain does not loud it “one-lane“
life. He had been a. standout cen-
ter-fielder on State's baseball squad
for the post thrce yours and is al-
rcndy looking forward to the com-
ini,r season.

Wcll liked by his clussinnlcs of
'51. he is it member of Edward Eld-

Pierce Takes Top
From Gamma Kap
in lM Bowling

The Gamma Kaps, who original-
ly held top place in the women's
bowling league. have lost their title
to the Pierce girls. who have a rec-
ord of seven wins and one loss to
date. Kappa Delta moved into sec—
ond place while Phi Delta and Psi
Gamma managed to tie for third.
Gamma Kappa and Sayles N0. 1
have both moved into fourth posi-
tion.

As the teams now stand, it ap-
pears that Pierce, in league A will
win the title easily, or defend it
against Psi Gamma or Phi Delta
in league B, providing Kappa Delta
remains in second place. It has been
shown that anything can happen on
the bowling ullcys' and what po—
sition the teams will shift to next
week is a matter of conjecture.

Resulting from over-forfeiture,
Beta Zeta has moved out of league
bowling for the semester.
liuldino Stars for Pierce

The top team boasts such pluy-
crs as Karen Prindlc, Annu Apos-
iolidcs. Riln Homer, Victoria Bal—
dlno. und Joun Dunn. Last week
Vickie Biildiiio took high scoring
honors with 166 and 150 for Pierce
in its buttlc ugulnst Kappa Dcltu.

cumc Chi Sigma 'I‘liciu by four pins.

John Brandow. 205 pounds.

Due to illness. Francis Schatzle
'53, and Glen Brenzel '53, will not
be able to match Albany Boys' Aca-
demy. However. the boys may pre-
sent an exhibition match.

The only men on the club with
previous wrestling experience in
high school are Fuerbach and
Thomas King, also on the club, but
who will be unable to wrestle.

Future iiiutrlies with ABC on
March 16 and RPI wrestling clubs
are planned. The (late for the latter
is undecided.

The men have worked hard, and
the show promises to be good—so
give it a try and come to watch the
matches today.

Basketball finals for women's iii—
tramurais were held yesterday in
Page Hall gym. They will be con-
tinued on Wednesday and next Sat-
urday. Beta Zeta, Pierce A, Kappa
Delta, and Phi Delta survived the
onslaught of the ten other chul-
lengers to enter the playoffs.

The Court Cruisers‘ fume has
spread . . . even to far off Sara-
toga. Again State has been asked
to participate in u playday, this
time at Skidmore. The date is
March 10. it has been proposed that
the agenda. not only include basket-
ball. but swimimng and a. text as
well.

If you saw the WAA-D&A game
Tuesday. you also saw the twirling
club in their reds and whites mak—
ing their debut. It's gratifying to
see the result of hours of practice
and patience turn out so well—nice
work!

Now thui the “shoots are showing"
and a “young man‘s fancy turns to
what 0 girl has bccn thinking about
all year." it's Camp Johnston hold-
ing the season attraction for bird
lovers. walk lovers, or just plain
lovers. Grab a train, forget your
troubles, relax, be yourself in the
fresh. untnlnted air in the hills of
Chuthnm—Go to Camp Johnston!

Every your about this time. WAA
begins to get constitution conscious.
This indicates ilini. u definite change
is needed, in order to allow for re—
(‘cnf expansion and newly develop-
cd sports. We would appreciate uny
suggestions or ideas on the subject.

The WAA budget for next your
came up for discussion at. the Tucs-
duy night. council meeting. The
changes weren't too important. cx-

PACE}

The Teachers of Albany State failed in the last 30 seconds to
win their final game of the season Wednesday night as they dropped
a thrilling 66-64 decision to the Oneonta State basketeers on the wide

Oneonta armory floor.

The game, played before 1,200 people who bought Heart Fund
benefit admission tickets, was sensational down to the final gun as
the Purple and Gold fought back from a thirteen point halftime deficit

to go ahead by one point just be
fore the end of the third quarter.

A large delegation of students and
faculty members from Albany wit-
nessed the visiting five’s determined
second half dere. Behind by 27-40
at halftime, the Feds staged a sharp
shooting exhibition to go ahead 54-
53 a minute before the end of the
third quarter. Then a set shot by
Oneonta’s Huntington put the home
team ahead to stay just before the
buzzer, 55-54.

Oneonta Freezes Ball

The score kept mounting with only
a few points separating the two
clubs as the game neared the end.
With three minutes to go, Oneonta
had dr "en ahead by 66-60, and they
went into a. freeze to hold that
lead, but the tight pressing Albany
forces continually broke up the
freeze to get the ball, only to miss
innumerable scoring opportunities
that might have won the game.

Two bucket shots, the first by Bob
Tabor, the other by Bob Brown,
brought the losers up to within two
points with 30 seconds to go, but
they missed two other chances in
those final seconds, and that was
the story of the game. Paul Carter,
who played a bright floor game.
fouled out with 45 seconds to go.
Then a missed one-handed push

 

shot by John Zongrone just as the
buzzer sounded ended the action.

Bob Brown’s usually brilliant game
paced the statesmen, as he con-
trolled the boards and meshed nine-
teen points. Defensive star Jim
Warden hit for 18 points while do-
ing a great job on Huntington,
Oneonta star, holding him to one
point in the last half.

It was the last game for four
Seniors. Al Kaehn, Jim Warden,
Max Fallek, and Paul Carter.

Last Friday the Peds scored an
imprcssive 72-56 win over an out-
manned Geneseo quint. After a
rather close first half, State’s su—
perior reserve forces piled up a com-
fortable spread and coasted to vic-
tory.

Working from a double pivot, the
local forces matched the sharp set
shooting of the visitors for the first
ten minutes. Midway through the
second stanza. successive hoops by
Tabor, Brown, and Zongrone gave
the Purple and Gold 8 nine point
lead. John Fiala of the Blue and
White kept his team in contention
with a seven point outburst in the
closing minutes of the second period.

Al Kaehn's 14 and Jim Warden’s
12 led the Pedagogue scorers.

Last night WAA started intra-

leugues stood, at the beginning of
play—offs, Beta Zeta led League I
with an undefeated season. Kappa
Delta took second place with only
one defeat‘to Beta Zeta in one of
the closest games of the season.

In League II, Pierce A, also unde-
feated, tops the play with a. one
game advantage over Phi Delta,
with one defeat.

N e x t Wednesday's encounters
should prove to be the most rugged
of the season. Beta Zeta. pace-set-

Pierce A, leaders of the other
league. In the first game of the
evening, Phi Delta and Kappa Delta,
both holding the second slots in
their respective leagues, will contend
for third and fourth places.

Last Saturday, Beta Zeta romped
over Saylcs to clinch their lead with
an undefeated season. Gamma Kap
defeated Pierce B, and Sayles down-
ed the Left Overs.
