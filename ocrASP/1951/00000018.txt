BEES TRACE PATH FROM ’BEAN E DAYS’

 

Row, row, row your boat—on dry land, no less. These nautical lasses
have just returned from a hair-raising, feet soaking adventure on the
high seas, otherwise known as Burden Lake. The picture was taken
during the female ’52ch eventful weekend at Frosh Camp in 1948.

Remember the cold nights, the unexpected swims, the secretive trips
to that place across the lake and the singing around the fireplace? We
also wondered if all phases of college life would be so exhausting.

 

Busy. busy, busy bccs already demonstrating their love for activi-
ties. After seeing the mob that turned out to affix their John Hancocks
to various and multitudinous lists, who could say that '52 would not
go fur—iii all directions?

(lulliblc members of the Class of '52 were also tricked by the
Sophomores and found themselves acquiring various worthless privileges.

“A pretty girl is like a melody,” and so goes the song. The Juniors, however, have five pretty girls
to rave about. One of these bits of feminine pulchritude will be crowned Queen of the Junior Prom m-
morrow night by last year's queen, Lenore Corcoran ’51. Voting on the candidates will take place today in
assembly, the results being kept secret. Pictured above from left to right are: Mrs. Mary Borys Marks, Helen
Pilcher, Marjorie Davis, Madeline Weltlauf, and Kathleen Ryan.

 

 

By JOYCE SHAFER.

When we made State our college
home,

We didn‘t know we'd have a porno

To tell our history to the masses

Of parties, games, and cutting class-
es.

But you don’t have to twist our arm,

For reminiscing does no harm.

We made our debut at Frosh Camp.

(September '48 was damp.)

Thus at the first, our friends we
made

And many little plans were laid.

We were received with heartiness;

Receptions are quite nice, I guess.

We found out soon our social status,

For ’51 was looking at us,

Presenting us with rules galore,

"Wear beanies" and “Use the side-
door,"

Activities day we spent some money,

Signed for Myskania (ha lie—funny)

We started off as anxious Frosh;

Herb Holland led us well, by gosh!

In sings and games, debate and skit,

And Kyle made our Big 4 a hit.

And on the day when we moved up

We beamed like mad at the rivalry
Cup. ., ' ' , I or I r

So you can see we had no fear marquu. heralding the pcriorinnnot of 02s bouliomore Big-4. Antici-

Beginnmg our Wonderful Sophomore pitting the large attendance, the students shown above arrived early
year. . . , ,

The yellow jackets Stm buzzed on to mimic themselves of good seats.

With another lender, Bowker. John.

We can’t forget what she did for us, ’

Our songleadcr. Miss Mary Borys.

Joyce Leavitt led the Big 4 gang

And put it over with a bang.

In sports we came to realize

The ability of our gals and guys.

In our dcbutors we took pride

For another victory on our side.

The happiest words of tongue or pen

Were: We won rivalry nguln.

Harv Robinson observed with haste

He couldn’t let us go to waste.

So as Juniors we started something
new:

Put Dul'g‘uscli‘s success, our Jr. Re-
vuc.

'I‘bc Ji'. Prom's our latest job-—

We hope that it attracts a mob.

Now Why try saying What's ahead?

For of the war. cliough's been said.

The olily thing that we can do

Is keep Julie '52 ill view,

Reliicmbcrilig what it has meant

That we to S.C.T. were sent.

Who ('llli forget what we've enjoyed

Or how we've soliictlmcs been un-
noycd?

It‘s little things that make us grow

(but not too much, too fast. you
