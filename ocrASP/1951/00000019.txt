As a result of the election held in
last week's assembly, Rae Dionne
oil, was named as Editor-in-Chief of
the Freshman Handbook. Of the
eight candidates for the position,
Irene Brenzinsky was the closest
competitor to Miss Dionne.

The lead for the office was begun
in the first distribution by Miss Di-
onne and she maintained this lead
until she reached the quota in the
seventh distribution. Miss Brenzin-
sky trailed Miss Dionne throughout
the distributions until the latter was
finally elected. Marion Beni '53, was
third in the first distribution and
she, likewise maintained the same
position until she was eliminated in
the sixth distribution.
