OPEN DAY

 

“A Clean Place To Eat”

167 Central Ave.

Recent interest, throughout the
country, in the plight of the first
year teacher has brought itself to
the public eye through conferences
of educators, meetings of adminis-
trators, and teachers. Capitol district
denizens demonstrated their interest
in the forgotten lot of the inexper-
ienced pedagogue. this week, at a
series of meetings held at State
College.

From the school administrator.
represented by William H. Martin,
Superintendent of the Scotia-Glen-
ville Central Schools, to the pupil,
whose attitudes were represented by
Paul Hedlund of the New York Ed-
ucation Department, various views
were exposed. Riley Osborne of Wa-
shington Irving Junior High School
in Schenectady voiced ideas that
new teachers should be given more
information about actual teaching
practices previous to the teaching
experiences themselves. He suggested
that there be more practice teach-
ing in average school situations; 116'
thought experienced teachers should
give practice teachers benefit of
their experiences by visiting col-
leges and acting as visiting profes-
sors.

That first year of teaching is
horrible. according to Mrs. Mildred

Henyon, an experienced teacher
from East Greenbush. She added
that if a teacher should survive
the discipline problems. the mass
of paper work and detail of the
first year he would begin to feel
secure.

Completing the agenda were meet-
ings in the individual departments.
Returning from these. delegates to
the conference heard five beginning
teachers give advice to them on the
intricacies of the teaching profes-
sion.

Sorority Demons

Crack The Whip

Proposals, pigtails and perfect
pandcmonium reigned in the
Commons as the sorority whip-
lashch provided a “helluva”
time for the frosh. Have you
received your love letters, men?

It looks as if the “Reds” have
infiltrated State and the Yanks
have started Spring Training in
the Commons. Education classes
will find an apropos place for
observing the little monstors on
the college campus . . . com-
peting with Milne, maybe?

Everyone travels to It. 1’. I.
and Union. but who were the
strange creatures going from the
“Indies to the Andes in their
undies?” Even Miss Kookcn-
brood of the “Happy People"
boarding house has found her
match in thc housewives of ’54.

One year of fiendish ideas
have reached their climax . . .
Bluejays take over.

SA Assembly
To Feature Pol
Budget Hearing

At the Student Council meeting
Wednesday night the proposed Stu-
dent Association budget was accep-
ted, and accordingly, it will be the
main topic of discussion in assembly
today. The Council also established
a permanent file to aid future com-
mittee chairman of all-college
events. The assembly agenda also in-
cludes a Seminar Day Poll and
announcements, according to James
Jiusto ’51, President of Student As-
sociation.

The Council requested Student
Board of Finance to investigate the
meal lilies and food allowances in
next year's budget. The Board is
also to study the possibility of in~
creasing the graduate student tax
now established at eight dollars.

Student Board of Finance wishes
to clarify its reasons for attempt-
ing to keep the budget down to a
minimum. according to Victoria Bal—
dino ‘52. Chairman. Due to the rise
in dormitory fees and the fact that
there may be a Student Union Fee,
next year‘s student expenses will be
greater. The Board is attempting
to make provisions so that the bud-
get will not have to operate on its
present deficit

lhiit the mystery wriici' should also
concern himself with an unusual

line in his "Red Herring Mili'dcr.’
