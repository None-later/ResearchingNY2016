It AilDepends on You

To-day you will be filling out questionaires to
determine whether or not you want a Moving Up
Day Formal. Commuters Club will base its deci-
sion to sponsor the dance on the results of this poll.

Last year Commuters Club reintroduced the tra-
ditional M.U.D. dance to State. Fun-ancially it
was successful; fin-ancially it failed. Not enough
couples attended to make the low bid fee meet the
expenses.

Our spring social calendar is quite full of for-
mals—individual group formals. Spirit reigns over
the individual groups; where is the spirit necessary
to insure the success of a united college formal
held in our own school buildings? There are inter-
class activities, group house activities, sorority and
fraternity activities. How many all-State functions
do we have?

Our school spirit seems more subconscious than
conscious. Out of a 1600 enrollment, approximately
100 students attended last year’s M.U.D. formal
Less than 7 percent of the student body supported
an all-college event held in our own buildings.

True, there were complications. Decision to hold
the formal came late in the season. Several class
parties were scheduled for the same night. This
year, Commuters Club is trying .to avoid similar
conflicts. The date had been set early in the year.
And with a formal on Friday night, why can’t
class parties be held on Saturday night?

Our school spirit is like the weather. We all
talk about it, but who does much about it? Com-
muters Club is prepared to do something about it.
Not for the financial success, but for the success
that comes from realizing that a lot of different
people enjoyed an evening together in their own
school.

To achieve this success Commuters Club needs
help. It all depends on YOU.

Spring, Love . . .

It’s spring, and in State’s assembly the fancy
turns not to love, but to money. To-day marks
the beginning of Student Associations annual bud-
get discussion.

In order to be put in operation, the budget must
pass through four phases. First, each organization
decides on its individual budget for the coming
year. Then the organization submits this proposed
budget to Student Board of Finance. The board
may make any changes it deems necessary, and
utimately approves the budget.

From the Student Board of Finance the budget
travels to Student Council. Here also it may be
changed in any line and is finally approved.

From Student Council the budget lastly is taken
to Student Association. Before the budget can go
into effect, it must be approved ill its entirety by
the student body. Student Association has the right
to alter any section of this proposed budget it
feels necessitates change.

The annual wrangle begins. It may be a tremen-
dous temptation to forget those complex—looking
figures, to let your fancy turn to love. But remem-
ber, the budget is your budget; the money involved
is your money.

Delerment Data

Abilities To Determine
Selective Service Status

The Selective Service Commission
has advised college students to apply
at once to their draft boards for
draft deferments for outstanding
ability to learn, according to Ed-
ward J. Sabol, Coordinator of Field
Services. Although State College has
received no official announcement,
the testing places for the aptitude
tests to determine the potential
learning ability have been announc-

ed.

The Student may be deferred for
his score or for ills rank ill his class.
The critical score for the aptitude
test is 75 per cent. The college stu—
dent must hold one of the following
ratings ill his class: Sophomores en-
ter1ng the Junior class, upper two-
thlrds; Junior entering the Senior
class, upper three fourths. No ar—
rangements have been made for
graduating students as yet.

Students wishing to be deferred
should contact their local selective
service boards and request forms
106 alld 107. The applicant shoutd
complete these forms indicating the
date and the place with the center
number that he prefers for the ex—
amination.

Tile registrant must mall these
forllls to the Educational Testing
Service at Princeton, New Jersey.
This department will assign the
date and place where the students
will be examined. Tile student will
also receive from the Testing Ser-
vice part of the form which he sub-
mitted. He must present this before
he will be allowed to take the ex-
amination.

Tests are scheduled for May 26.
June 16, and June 30. Tile tests
will be offered for State students
at center number 694.

Tile tests will include mathe—
matics problems and the reading of
passages, charts, and tables to de-
termine the comprehensive ability
of the student, and his ability to
apply principles.

To the Editor:

Last year Commuters Club spon-
sored a Movlllg-Up-Dlly Semi-For-
llllll, but they ran into scheduling
conflicts with other organizations.
Those who attended said it was
the best Oil—campus (lllllcc yet.

Tile gym was tl'lillsl‘ol'llled into
MINERVA‘S BALLROOM. Dr. Col-
lins presented it gift to Barbara
Newcomb, reigning Goddess Miller'-
vn. Tllc ROSE LOUNGE had tele—
vision. dim lights, and soft chairs.
Tllc more ambitious went to the
TERRACE GARDEN CABARET ill
tile Commons for refreshments and
music by Jess Bartlett and Joan
Bostwlck.

For $1.75 no one believed it could
be any good. but the dance was sue-
eessl'ul in every way except finan-
cially. The club stood the loss. Now
we wont. to know what to do this
year.

We‘re willing to sponsor the
dance. The Calendar Committee
classified the MUD Setlli—l‘ol‘lllnl its
one of the four major events on
Culllpus. They inch dolle their best
to clear tlle calendar. It is a lllujor
step towards it big spring weekend.

When you vote 111 Assembly today
please keep these facts ill lllllld.

lVCF Plans Series Of Lectures,-

Newman Club Slates Discussion

Inter-Varsity Christian Fellow-
ship has planned a series of noon-
hour lectures to be held Tuesday,
April 10 through Friday, April 13,
according to Fleta Wright ’52, Pre-
sident. Gerald Brophy ‘51, Presi-
dent of Newman Club, announces
that a lecture, the fourth of the
semester, will be held Thursday at
7:30 pm. at Newman Hall. student
Christian Association has delegated
Helen Pilcher ’52 to the Student
Christian Movement Council meet-
ing which will be held at Wagner
Coclllege ill New York City this week-
en .

Tile theme of the IVCF lectures
which are being held in Room 20
is “Present Tense, Future Perfect.”
Joseph Bayly, who has worked with
Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship
groups throughout the country. will
be the main speaker. His topics will
include, “Is Faith In God a Delu-

 

Peiie Rules 
in '52 'Bunnyland'

“When the Deep Purple falls
Over rabbit-covered Shaker
Ridge walls——”

And the walls were more than
“‘l-abbit-covercdl" They were
“card-covered" with austere
kings. queens, and jacks intent-
ly watching the couples swirl—
ing to Harry Vincent's theme
song. While in the balcony, the
Mad Hatter casually sipped his
ten.

With whispered “Oh's” and
“Ah’s” the evening came to a
climax. It was the coronation of

Junior Prom Queen. To the
strains of the “Coronation
March." l’etic Davis received

her crown from cx-queen Len-
ore Corcomn.

While “visions of bunny rab—
bits danced in their heads," the
couples departed. A formal a. la
“Alice In Wonderland” had
made an evening grand.

Informal discussion “cone” hours
will be held each afternoon in the
Lounge from 3:30 to 4:30 pm. There ,
will be an opportunity to ask ques-
tions and discuss them with Bayly.

The following sororities, fraterni-
ties, and group houses have ar-
ranged to have a member of the
IVCF staff with them for an in-
formal evening discussion. Tuesday
night discussions will be at Psi Gam-
ma, Sayles, Thurlow, Kappa Delta
Rho; Wednesday at Kappa Delta,
Edward Eldred Potter Club. Alpha
Epsilon Phi, Pierce Hall; and
Thursday, at Beta Zeta.

Similar lecture series have been
held throughout the United States
and Canada in order to acquaint
college students with basic Chris-
tianity, according to Miss Wright.
Since IVCF is a non-denomination-
al group, everyone is welcome to at-
tend the lectures and express his
views.

The Newman Club lecture to be
given Thursday is entitled “The
Catholic Press.’ The speaker is Rev-
erend Joseph Varden, former Navy
chaplain and present assistant Ed-
itor of the EVANGELIST, the A1-
bally Diocese Catholic newspaper.
