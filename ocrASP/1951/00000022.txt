Pursuant to the absurdly point-
less condition (otherwise known as
Rivalry) currently existing through-
out this institution of higher learn-
ing, we, being of sound mind and
healthy body, do hereby present for
serious consideration the following;
. however, before we proceed, we
should very emphatically like to in-
form our readers that We are not
ardent advocates of euthanasia
(commonly known as “mercy kill-
;ng") as far as human lives are con-
cerned, but when a condition such
as Rivalry is expected to receive
such precedence from the freshmen
and Sophomores at State, we feel
that a “mercy killing” of this tradi-
tion is the only solution for the pr -
servation of that which should be
attained from attending college.

According to the Freshman Hand-
book, “one of the most interesting
and more exciting of State College
traditions is the Inter-Class Rivalry
Contest. It is in rivalry that a class
has the opportunity to show just
how much spirit it really has or has
not."

Can you honestly say that
Rivalry is “one of the most interest-
ing and more exciting of State Col-
lege traditions," or that it tends to
promote or bring out class spirit?

Of what value is Rivalry? Sup-
posedly it has been designed to pro-

Waldorf

OPEN DAY

 

By SIMON and CORIGIANO —-

 

mote friendship and a feeling of
unity within and between classes.
Do you feel that through Rivalry
you have gained additional friend-
ships which otherwise may not have
been yours through normal everyday
encounters? Rather. is it not that
your friends have been personally
selected from among those students
here at State whose interests are
best suited to your own?

It seems rather obvious that Riv-
alry has only succeeded in inciting
feelings contrary to those of its or-
iginal purpose. The world itself
implies dissenslon, not unity. We
realize that a certain amount of
inter—class activity is not only per-
missable, but desirable, however,
we feel that these activities could be
fewer and could be exercised during
a much shorter period of time. The
time consumed by Rivalry through-
out the year might be utilized to
better advantage for the student.

The general concensus of opinion
towards Rivalry at State College is
such that an apathy has arisen
which may be connected with the
appalling apathy towards everything
in this “institution.” Therefore, we
beseech you, Myskania, healers of all
slcknesses, to discover a cure for
this condition soon. or else relieve it
from its misery through euthanasia.

The time has come for the stud-
ent body at State to appropriate
funds for student activities. Most
important of these is the M.A.A.
allotment.

It is appropriate and fitting that
this legislation occurs at the outset
of the State College baseball sea-
son. Baseball is probably the only
real spectator sport that is yet un-
tarnlshed by fixes and gambling.
Basketball and football contests are
questionable but baseball cannot
be doubted. However, these prob—
lems do not confront the Adminis-
tration of this College.

Sports at State enjoy a unique
posrtion in that the motives and in-
tents of all persons connected with
our athletic program can never be
doubted; that their sense of values
conform with the true ideals of
sportsmanship and all the other fine
qualities of athletics.

In an institution the size of ours
no false value is placed on indi-
vidual ability. Without the problem
of commercialization we are able to
realize the ultimate goal of an ath-
letic program ‘ the moulding of
character. The truth of these facts
is so obvious that it lends to make
them obscure and unappreciated.

Many times in the past, and prob-
ably in the future, the skeptic will
question the ultimate results of our
athletic program, pointing out and
stressing the fact that we had a
losing team in a certain sport. In
so doing he merely shows that he
himself has fallen victim to a
false sense of values and thus un-
wittingly accepts the logic of those
who advocate commercialization;
the buying of ballplayers to secure
a winning team. The external pur-
pose of any athletic program is.
of course, to produce winning teams,
but, as we have pointed out, this
is not the ultimate objective.

We, the students at State. have
much to be proud of. The knowledge
that our boys are playing their
hearts out for us, not for national
fame, monetary achievements, or
the like, is more than enough evi-
dence that our athletic program is
successful where other colleges fall.

Therefore, when we consider the
impending budget, we are actually
appraising the efforts of, not only
the participants in varsity sports,
but also. the many spectators who
help make our athletic department
a success in its efforts to maintain
these high standards. We, the stu—
dent body. can make this depart-
ment more successful, and have it
\continuc its important functions
by supporting the MAA.

Baseball Men
in Conditioning
Work At Gym

With only two weeks before they
open their twelve game schedule.
Coach Merlin Hathaway's baseball
charges are anxiously awaiting a
chance to get outdoors. For three
weeks. the Varsity and JV candi-
dates have had daily workouts in
Page Hall. Coach has been putting
a squad of approximately forty men
through their paces. Due to the c105e
quarters afforded by Page. he has
been forced to stress bunting prac-
tice, . running exercises, infield
scooping, and arm conditioning.
Expect to Move Outdoors

The Coach was not too optimistic
about this year's team even though
he has a crew of seasoned ball
players left over from last year's
club which posted a .500 average in
a dozen or so tussles. He cannot say
anything too substantial until he
sees his boys at work at Bleecker
Stadium. The present plans call for
the first outdoor practice tomorrow.
Veterans Returning

A quick look at the veterans rc-
turning to this year‘s squad should
leave you with a favorable impres-
sion of their chances. The infield is
well stocked with experience. The
first base job will probably go to
Ken Rutley who has played the in-
itial sack for the past two years.
The keystone combo should see Paul
Carter and Harry Johnson in ac-
tion. Little Willie Englchart will re—
turn to the hot corner, a position he
has held for the past two seasons.
Two first string outfleldcrs are re-
turnlng, they are fleet-footed Don
McDonald and llill‘d-lllttlllg‘ A1
Kachn. The baticrymcn returning
to the Fed lincup are pitchers
George Lion and Herb Egeri. both
of these boys are right handers. On
the receiving end of the mound du—
tics John Stevenson and Doug Ad-
:unson are the seasoned catchers.
Scheduli- Released for Varsity

The Feds have a half dozen games
away and at home. The schedule
gocs as follows: April 21, Utica (H);
25, Hartwick lid); 28. Utlca (A):
May 5. Danbury tHl; 8, Onconta
(A); 1‘). Ncw Paltz (H1; 16, New

Only two games have been set up
for the Junior Varsity team. The
Coach is working for a few more
culncs with local colleges and top
notch amateur competition. A home

Our sportlight spotlight is focused
this week upon another member of
the varsity bowling squad —— Bob
Sinkledam. Bob. a Sophomore, 1s
bowling in arsity competition for
the first time. Hailing from Newark,
N. Y.. he began building up a love
for the game, about six yelvs ago in
his home town.

Last year in Men‘s IM Bowling
League competition, Bob coupled
with Carmen Corsl to win the IM
doubles crown. His greatest thrill on
the alleys came the day he hit the
maples for a 230 score. On several
occasions he has picked off the dif-
ficult 4, 7. 10. and 6. 7, 10 splits
combinations. He has also main-
tained a league average of 160.

In high school, Bob participated
in many extra-curricular activities,
among which can be found bowling,
football and track. Although active
and proficient in football and track,
Bob soon took a liking to the “knock-
em-down" game. Gradually this
part-lime activity grew from a like
to a love until it is now his first
love.

The former Eagle Scout's burning
desire is to be able to hang his shin—
gle outside of his own bowling estab-
lishment.

“It's a job that I know I would
like—and would do."

The 6’2”. Science Major—Minor.
has not neglected to maintain his
versatility here at State. He is a
member of KDR. and plays on its
football and volleyball teams. Bob
also enjoys a game of softball, and
is a member of the Lover‘s IM soft-
ball squad.

Three Men's Volleyball Leagues

To Engage In Intramural Program

The intramural volleyball contest
will once again be resumed next
week. Games will be played every
Monday and Thursday nights and
on Saturday noons. This program
will consist of three leagues each
made up of six teams.

The Angels, who beat Pot-
ter for the championship last year.
are again rated as one of the top
favorites. However much competi-
tion will be seen from the expected
strong teams of KDR, SLS, KB.
Potter. and the Beavers.

the entire field without his 42-pin
handicap and topped his own league

Have Already Proven Themselves Capable Oi Intercollegiate Competition

Slate‘s newly formed Wrestling
Team. boasting an undefeated sea-
son. has scheduled its final match
of the year against ABC on April
20 in Page Hall Gym. This is State's
second encounter with ABC for the
season.

March 16, the Pods, with a single
victory chalked up against Albany
Academy. met and defeated the
more experienced ABC squad. In
five. of the six matches. the grap-
plcrs had from eight to nineteen
pound handicaps.

In the first match of the after-
noon, Phil Billings, wrestling in
the 158 pound class, lost by a fall
to Chuck Wray of ABC who cut-
weighed him by cighteen pounds. In
the next event, State‘s Fran Schat-
zle, tipping the scales at 149, re-
ceived an 8—5 decision over St. Or-
ange to lake the 160 pound class.

Next, Joe Lombardi, grappling
with a 19 pound handicap in the
172 pound class, took a 5-1 decision
from Kelly of the Maroon.

Harvey Milk, in the closest strug-
gle of the day, took a 6-4 decision
over Miller of the Businessmen.
Milk. outweighed by eight pounds,
was losing until the last 30 seconds,
but smashed his way to a stunning
victory.

Hank Fem-back, under a 12 pound
disadvantage, took a 7-2 decision
over Scales of ABC. In the last
competition, Joe Pcrsico, with an
advantage of twenty pounds, pin-
ned his opponent in 3.10 for the
second and quickest fall of the
day, taking the heavy weight class.

Things are looking up for next
year. Wrestling may be initiated as
a varsity sport. At present squad
workouts will continue until the
last meet. Any men interested in
trying to gain a birth on next sea-
son‘s squad will contact Coach Gar-
cia. If interest is sufficient, prac—
tice will continue through until
June.

Garcia Attends Tourney

During the Easter Holiday, Coach

Garcia attended the National Col-

legiate Wrestling Tourney at Lchi
University, Bethlehem. Pennsylvan-
ia and the coach's meeting. He re-
ports that the matches were the
finest he has seen during his wresl<
ling career and that the Eastern
schools are definitely improving. Us-
ually they manage only one or two
competitors in thc Semi-finals, but
this year the East took two of
eight Title Weight Division Cham-
plonshlps.

In one of the most stunning up-
sets of the season the st. Marys' An-
gels overcame an eight point first
quarter deficit to smash their way
to a 49-44 victory over a powerful
Potter aggregation in the semi-
final round of the State College In-
vitational tourney.

Sparked by Mile Biloz’s 22 points
the Angels successfully smashed
through the zone defense as pre-
sented by Potter while Mike's accu-
rate one hander from the outside
drew out the tight Potter defense,
Johnson and Dolan of the Angels
were able to go to work on the in-
side. These two men, in the second
half, hooped 12 points between
them. Although not high in the
scoring columns, credit should also
be given to Ted Peene who played
a beautiful rebounding game on
both boards.

Angels Heavy Favorites

However, due to two previous de-
feats by the Angels, the Ockymen
will be the decided underdogs in the
final game.

On Monday night the other game
of the Invitations saw the Finks
lose by 13 points to the Angels. The
score was 41-28. Here again, Biloz
showed the way as he dunked 18
points, and played his usual fine
floor game. For the losers, Bob Ja-
coby and Tom Yole put away 12
and 8 points apiece.

SLS Romps Over KB

Sigma Lambda Sigma had an easy
time gaining its final berth, by
trouncing a Kappa Beta quintet
46-31. Slurms garnered 11 to top
the victors. while Ryder meshed 8
for the losers. KB had previously, in
the first round of play, eliminated
KDR.

Contrary to the weather, spring is
really here. It's time to exchange
those skiis for a tennis racket and
start swinging a softball bat in-
stead of that ping pong paddle. Ac-
cording to WAA Council, Havens
and Riley will direct tennis in
Wilthlllgtoll Park while Buzzy Burke

~ and Gwen Galllvan will referee soft-

ball on Page Hall field. Archery will
be under the supervision of Zylco
and O‘Leary; Prindle and Murray
will act as co-captains of volleyball.
Jane Hanson and Joyce Leonard will
take charge of riding, and Connie
Chadwick will serve double duty on
hiking and Camp Johnston. This is
lhc last. season of the sports year
so check WAA bulletin board.

'1 he plans to attend a basketball
playdav at Green Mountain have
been canccllcd due to the crowded
calendar for the Spring season.
Stale owcs them a visit and hopes
to fulfill the obligation at a future
date.

Tuesday night WAA Council de-
voted their meeting to a discussion
of possible changes in the constitu-
tion. Representation on Council is
now supplied by class managers and
representatives. This method is a
vestige of former years when the
main emphasis was on inter-class
sports. With the expanded inter~
collegiate and intramural programs.
rccenlly developed. the most import-
ant problclns occur within the indi-
vidual sports. The concensus of op-
inion indicates [hill the representa-
tion should be filled by the sports
captains who are directly connected
with the intro-mural program.
Sports captains are now appointed
by WAA Council but if they served
as Council members they would be
elected by those girls who particip-
ulcd in the sport. This system would
allow for more representation on
Council and closer organization
among the various sports. These
ideas are still indefinite but should
be given careful consideration by
WAA members. If you have any op-
inions on these ideas or any other
suggestions for constitutional revi—
sion please write them out, and drop
them in the WAA mailbox.
