Students Desire

Semiformal Dance

AI a result of the MUD for-
mal poll taken in assembly by
Commuters Club Friday, the
"semis" won out over the “in”
by a margin of 192 votes. Of
some 650 students polled, 432
favored a semiformal dance,
while 240 cast their ballots for
an informal affair. The attend-
ance figures were close with 264
stating that they would attend
a, semiformal and 254 that they
would go to an informal dance.

0f the comments recorded on
the ballots, a very popular one
was simply, "have one!" One
optimistic soul suggested that
girls' hours be cancelled, and
another that the classes hold
their "birthday" parties Satur-
day night after the Moving-Up
Day Sing. Perhaps the most
practical of the statements was,
“let‘s go all out for decorations
and attendance at this year's
MUD formal."

Page Hall for the fresh Big-4. "I‘hc
jays are anxiously awaiting the ar-
rival of Tahl and her native friends
set for April 21 at 8:30 pm. under
the flagship of Two Moons.

This demure native girl. better
known as Nellu Bertin, is the object
of much remorse. Doug, alias Don
Ki'ug‘, has deceived her, for he is no
longer infatuated by her womanly
wiles but has become enchanted by
the innocent charm of Diana. an
English lass, portrayed by Ellie Bal-
skis.

With Nancy Roosa as Director and
Ethel Pierson, Co-dircctor the fresh
are shaping things up for the grand
opening. Included in the display of
creative talent will be two original
songs. Barbara Sica and Barb Car-
ncr, script writers. have collaborated
to write the words and music to

“White Devils." Neil Brown, Musi—
cal Director, is responsible for the
title song.

A ten-piece. orchestra. organized
by Brown will render some of his
original arrangements. To climax
the production. Frank Gianniionc in
the role of Loki, who is in love with
'f‘nhi. ontrcuts her to forget Doug
and accept him. instead. Gianmione’s
rendition of "’I‘cmptation" will high-
light thc action.

A sub-plot is in the making when
Reggie. played by Harry Warr, finds
a peace pipe which means that he
is supposedly the true ruler of 'l‘ahl’s
home island This obnoxious child
prodigy who is liilli‘t' interested in
butterflies and needlepoint adds
comedy to the production With his
witty remarks. Aunt Kale ll’mn
Calubrrsci adds her oil to the fire
by encouraging Doug and Llic nilull'
beta/ecu Doug and Diana.

Arthur Stone, director of chorco—

graphy, will do solo dancing. To add
to the tropical atmosphere. Marion
Schoch will direct a group of girls
in a hula hula. To give emphasis to
this feature. a special lighting ef—
fect will be used. Miss Schoch will
also do a solo interpretive dance.

The set committee. headed by Do~
lorcs Domicily. is painting palm
trees and coconuts so that Tnhi will
find the setting natural. Also add—
ing its bit to create atmosphere is
the prop committee under the direc—
tion of Rosemary Bradt.

Original ideas to publicize the
production dominate the thoughts
of Ralph Adams and his publicity
committee. Paul Suimond, lights;
Esta Ecksticn, Make-up; and Mary
Ann Reiling, Costumes, are also pre—
paring their committees for the
work that night.
