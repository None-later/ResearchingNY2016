Debators Grab
Cup From Keuka

Who done it? They wouldn’t
dare. It’s never been done be-
fore. C’mon. tell us what hap-
pened. Is there a reward? Let’s
spill the works because it’s all
over the underworld by now.

States debators stole the little
gold prize right from under the
noses of thirteen other New
York State institutions. Sought
madly by the other teams our
gang used their heads and over-
powered the lookout men, Roch-
ester; Houghton. and St. Law-
rence. Swiftly they rubbed out
Hobart and headed for the fi-
nal clash.

The zero hour drew near and
by beating Keuka. to the draw,
they copped the cup for the
get-away. If it hadn't been for
the actions of Tom Godword
’51 and James Thompson ’54
the prize package wouldn't be
in our hands.

For us they have gained great
honors and we can now “go
straight." at last.
