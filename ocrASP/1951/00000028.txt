To the Editor:

I wonder how many students of
State College are aware of the per-
sistant campaign for world disarma-
ment which is being pushed by
many of our Congressmen. On Feb-
ruary 28, 23 members of Congress,
nine of them members of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee or the
House Foreign Affairs Committee,
wrote to President Truman asking
hint to follow up his general plea
for disarmament made last October
with definite proposals to the UN.
now for complete disarmmncnt un-
der the direction and inspection of
the UN.

Senator Flanders of Vermont. who
is one of these Congressmen, in a re-
cent lcttcr says that letters to the
President, our Senators and our
Representatives would now be a
great help to these tncn of Coli-
gi‘css. He believes that such a move
would help restore moral world lead—
rrshlp to the US.

it seems to me, that we as pros-
pective teachers must be morally
bound to preserving peace, sanity
and freedom of education and that
We must work tirelessly to unglorify
war. Somewhere, sometime. someone
is going to find it necessary to work
lor the universal practice of disarm-
amcpt us the only eil'ectlvc way to
world peace and security. Why can't
we join lil this move which some of
our nblcsi Congressmen are striving
to advance now?

i ask you to print this letter as
an appeal to Stale College students
to study recent proposals tor dis-
urnuutu-Iil, to wctgh them serioust
against thousands oi ycm's oi try-
in.; to halt. wars through armed

this month, asking thctn to work

tnuy contact the Council on Stu—

dent Travel, 53 Broadway, New

York City.

DelegatesDisclose

Purpose Oi ESA

The aims of the Eastern states
Association of Professional Schools
for Teachers Conference were dis-
cussed at Student Council meeting
Wednesday by Edwin Kurlander '51,
Co-Chaii‘man of State's delegation.
The conference held at the Hotel
New Yorker, New York City, last
Weekend, was attended by five dele-
gates.

The conference had three major
aims. They were as follows: 1. To
promote a better understanding- of
democracy and more constructive
cooperative efforts of students, fac-
ulty, and administrators on each
college campus; 2. To arrange for
State and regional conferences for
students and faculty to allow more
people to participate; 3. To urge
colleges to exchange a few students
and faculty members for a few days
during the regular school session.
With these aims in mind, the (icic-
gates discussed subjects relating to
the theme. "Human Relations in the
Schools."

Ruth Liepmann '51, was Co—Chaiv-
man with Kurlander. The remainder
of the delegation consisted of David
Manley, Theresa Porto. and Daniel
Joy, Juniors. Before leaving for the
conference, the delegates polled the
student body in order to get a true
concept of student opinions.

tional Problem Seminar Day, Wed-

Far East,” will be discussed in hour-
ly periods from 9 am. to 12 noon.
“Can Europe Be Economically and
Politically Unified?” and “The Role
of Germany in 1951" will b econ-
sidered from 2:30 p. m. to 4:30 pm.

Two speakers have been engaged.
They are Ray Hartsough, College

eral of the Far Eastern Commis-
sion.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. APRIL 20. 193!

'Weatherbouncls' Baseball Team

71...: 44.4.4 4...... 2,...

By PAUL BUCIIMAN

 

Most readers are aware by now of my contention that the best
program for this school would be an emphasized intramural pro—
gram, where all facilities would always be available for intramural
use. Such a program would be, without question, most advantageous
for the most students. The situation as it now stands precludes any
possibility of unlimited student activity in athletics, or as often 1a-
beled here, apathetics.

The qitasi-probiem of “what’s wrong with college athletics"
has become the victim of the mass confuscr and master (listortcr,
the ogre of “oversimpliiication."

First, is there a problem? No radically new situation exists, no
startineg new facts have been uncovered. nothing unusual has dc—
vcloped to alter the question, “What is best for those concerned?"
Are we getting, the most for our money. are we getting.r the best re-
sults for our efforts, and, what can we (in that will be for the im-
provement of the situation?

While both MAA and the athletic department of the school have
been very generous in the use and lending of actual equipment,
there still remains the problem of space and time. During.r the bats-
ketball season, it is virtually impossible for an individual to f:.i(i
time in which he may have a workout or scrimmage in the gym, un-
less he wants to play between O and 0:30 p. m., ordinarily an un-
heard of hour for basketball.

Every year the MAA budget gets bigger and bigger. There is
no question as to the validity of the .\l;\:\ requests: while the ath-
lctic program is being run as its is. )l.-\.-\ should get every penny
ihev ask for without restrictions. However. when i think of the tre-
mendous program that that 0,157 dollars could set tip for the men
here in this school. i wonder whether we are headed in the right di-
rcclion. Athletics should always be a participant activity. Spectator
sport, while they have their values. arc so questionable in relative
merit, that it is almost impossible to see why they carry such a
forceful weight in our thinking.

and spills.

Tuesday night in Page Hall
Gym, the “grand old” Seniors
trampled the jelly Juniors to
the merry tune of 36-15. The
contest began in a sec-saw man-
ner with the sparkling Seniors
pulling away at half-time to
a nine point lead. “Tiny” Hicks
of the Gremlins coped high scor-
ing honors with 19 points, while
“Dead Eye” Erdle meshed in
six for the Bees. The outstand-
ing “fix” play of the game oc-
curred when “Sharp Shooter"
Haggcrty threw a. l-o-n-g for-
ward pass to “Precious” Pileher.

The half-time antics of sing-
ing and circle skipping proved
that girls will be girls when
they come together. And natur-
ally, the eontest had a tremen-
dous ending with “Hula llot”
Harris doing her famous dance
number."

 

 

VOLLEYBALL
SUMMATION

The 1M \ollcybull lcugue moved
into its second week of play with
three very exciting and well played
games Monday night. There was
also an important. captain's meeting
at which the lollowing rules were
set down:

i. The representative of the team
scheduled to rci‘crec must be at the
court. by iiziiil and take responsibility
for all equipment.

2. If the referee does not appear
during the entire evening his team
will be dropped from the leagues.

3. If he appears by 7:30, that is,
the end of the first game, points will
be subtracted from his team total.

The first oi the 3 Monday con—
tests saw KB down the Pros to the
tune of 15-3. 15-10. All did not go
so well for KB however, as they
were forced to watch their farm-
hands, the K'bobbles, creamed by
Potter. 15-0. l5-l. The third match
of the night was the closest. of the
year as the Beavers took the Rams.
15—13 and 15-6.

PAC! I

With Utica Saturday

Tomorrow afternoon State College officially opens the Capitol
District baseball season while playing host to the Utica College nine.
"F his will be the lidlifter for both clubs as the meet at Bleecker Sta-

dium at 2 :30.

The Purple and Gold have been hampered quite badly by the
weather. To date, they have been able to get oiny four or five out-
door practices. The inclement weather has been harder yet on Coach
Merlin Hathaway. He has not had an adequate opportunity to really
make a selection of his starting line up.

WAKSETEW
Spring Sports,
Plans Elections

WAA has conjpleted plans for
the spring sports season. New cap-
tains have been elected, sports sche-
duled, and plans for the annual
Spring Spree are under way.

WAA elections are also coming up.
Spring season is the last chance
to earn not only award credit, but
also the right to hold a WAA of-
fice and the right to vote in WAA
elections.

Volleyball captained by Prindle
and O‘Lcary; archery, under Zylko
and Murray; and softball headed by
Gallivan and Burke will highlight
activities on Dortn Field. League play
is planned in both volleyball and
softball, in addition to practice ses-
slons.

Riding at Sander's Field may be
arranged through captains Hanson
and Leonard. Hiking, in collabora-
tion with the RPI Hiking Club,
is also headed by Connie Chadwick.

Captains Migliaclo and McGaln
are to be in charge of badminton
which will be held in Page Gym
week nights. Both supervised and
free tennis will be held in Wash-
ington Park. Hours should be re-
corded with either Ripley or Havens.

All credit hours must be recorded
with the captains in time for Spring
Spree which will be held at Camp
Johnson the latter part of May.

Kappa Beta To
Meet Vermonters

Kappa Beta will meet the Ver-
monters in a National League soft-
ball contest on the Page Field Diu-
tnond today at 4:30. marking the
season‘s debut for both squads.
Captain Dick Wander will probably
send “Bullet Bill“ Taylor to the hill,
while the mentor of the Green
Mountain Men has not yet named
his starter.

’i‘omorrow. in a triple header, the
Beavers will meet the Itnms, the
Leftovers will take on a powerful
Potter (‘iuh aggregation, and the
li‘lnks will try to make the Kaduvcrs
live up to their nanlc. In what pro-
mises to be a unique contest the
Philosophers Club vies with the
.Icrks on Monday at 4:30 at Page
Field.

The first two panics ot' the season,
scheduled for lusl Monday and
Tuesday, were postponed. by rain
and snow respectfully. causing a be-
lutcd opener to be played on Wed-
nesday. This proved to be ti wide
open. free-hitting contest, with the
Angels lrmnpltng rl‘hurlow Terracc‘s
..ii't to State College softball. 30-15.

The Angels. amassing 12 runs be-
fore the Thurlowmcn could break
into the scoring column, managed to
score in every frame, while the ins»
crs saved their stlckwork for the
last three stanzas.

'l‘ln- victors employed three pitch-
ers. Hawkins started and was reliev-
ed by Pecue and Biloz. For Thur-
low, lien Button was the starter.
and he gave way to lslldcridgc in the
sixth.

 

The Coach will most likely go
with a team whose nucleus will be
veterans from last year's squad.
The boys who seem to be sure of
starting berths are Paul Carter,
Ken Rutiey, and Bill Englehart in
the infield; and Al Kaehn in the
outfield. The fourth spot in the in-
field is a toss up among Pete Gior-
dano, Al Cannon, and Joe Stella.
Doug Adamson and Harry “The
Cat” Johnson are vielng for the
lush right field duty, while the
center garden job finds two likely
freshmen. John Zongrone and Tom
Hoppey, seeking the starting nod.

The only other sure thing the
Coach has in his plans is his choice
of a starting pitcher. He will start
Bill “Red” McCormack against the
UC nine. Popular "Red" is a rangy
right hander with a lot of control.
Herb Egert and George Lien will be
on hand for relief chuckhig if nec-
essary. Hathaway plans to divide
the backstop duties between John
Stevenson and Al Caserie.

The Feds are probably facing the
strongest team they will meet all
year. The Utes veteran squad has
six regulars in the line up. The vis-
itors will nominate either Carl
Luebbert or Bob Collettl to take
the hill against the Statesman.
Both of these lads have had two
years of collegiate competition. The
Utlca batting punch is expected
from infielder-s Dan Carrol and
Lou Jeff.

By JOE LUCE

 

 

We cornered Frank Cassette after
he had completed a match at the
Siena alley’s the other night.

"How goes it, Frank?”

' "Oh, not too bad, Joe. My thumb
is a bit sore though. Before I came
up here tonight, I bowled seven
games, and that much bowling can
irritate anybody‘s thumb, I guess."

“Just call it an occupational haz-
ard," we said. "Sometimes even the
best of baseball pitcher’s are
plagued by a sore thumb or even
sorer arms."

We asked the shy freshman,
"How much bowling did you do in
high school?”

"I did no bowling in high school.
Our school didn't have a bowling
team, but I did bowl in a church
league."

"Well, how do you account for
the fact that you are bowling with
some of State's best and in one of
the better leagues in the area."

"i tried out for the team and
was fortunate enough to make it,
that's all," he replied.

Frank's good fortune that ac-
n trophy, for he won the cup for
the highest singles game in league
competition.

It isn‘t just god fortune that ac-
count for Frank‘s skill.

When not knocking them down
the ltl-year-old Elmirun, can usual-
ly be seen setting them up.

"You‘d be surprised at the things
you can learn from behind those
pins."

Which only proves what. a little
learning can do down a bowling al-
lcy.
