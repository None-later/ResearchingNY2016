Thirty - Fifth Myskanie Tapping

After a lapse of one year, the women have once again regained a
majority of the positions on the Senior Honorary Society. To the
1951-52 Myskania, there were elected seven women, with men filling
the six remaining positions.

After the traditional singing of “Arm in Arm,” a bush settled
over the Assembly as the retiring Myskania slowly filed into the
second row of chairs on the stage, leaving the first row vacant, to
be filled as new members were tapped.

As the tapping ceremony started, the first members of the
1950-51 Myskania to step forward were Donald Paul Ely, who acted
as speaker, calling out the names of the new members, and William
Howard Engclllarl, Chairman of the group, who pinned the new mem-
bers with the purple and gold tassles, symbols of the office.

After Gerald Ernest Dunn and Paul Elliot Kirsch circled the Aud-
itorium and stopped by his seat, the name of WILLIAM TWIGGAR
WILEY boomed out, and he became the first member of the 1951-52
Myskania to be tapped. Wiley, as President of Student Association,
will guide the affairs of the Assembly next year.

HELEN MARIE l’lLCHER, new President of Student Chris-
tian Association and member cx-officio of Music Council, was the
next person seated on stage, as she was led to her seat by James Al-
]rrd W arr/cu and K irsr/r. She was soon joined by HENRY FENTON
SMITH, who was escorted to the stage by Lloyd Joseph Purdy and
Marl/m Jean Downcy. Smith is the new presiding officer of Dramatics
and Arts Council, and has for the past year been a member of Stu—
dent Council.

As silence once again settled over the Auditorium, James Edward
Jiusro and Lair Lillian l’rcsroll left their places on the stage, circled
the assemblage, mid led VICTORIA MARIE BALDINO to the ros-
trum, wh‘erc Itngrl/mrl pinned her with the gold and yellow tassle.
Miss Baldino, retiring Vice-President of Student Association, will
direct the activities of next. year‘s Women’s [freshman Camp. She
has also been cleccid to Student Board of Finance.

Alicr Miss Baldino had taken her place on Stage, W (mlcn. and
I’Mrrly tapped DAVID EARL MANLY, new Student Council repre-
sentative from the Class of 1952. Manly has nslo been active in the
activities of his class. The growing ranks were soon increased, as
HARVEY LAWRENCE ROBINSON became the fourth man to
join the group. He was conducted to the stage by Phyllis M m: Harris
and Kirsch. Robinson has been active in most of the activities of
his class, serving during the past year as President, and will continue
as :1 member of Student Council for next year.

DAVID MYRON SHEPARD continued the parade of men, as
he was escorted to the platform by Jiuslo and Miss Downcy. Shep-
ard has been chosen as the new Director of Men’s Freshman Camp,
and will serve on the Student Facilities Board.

At lost another woman was tapped. Patricia xiumz Inf and Hal-
mul/I Willi Sr‘lmllzr slowly circled the Auditorium and stopped beside
the sect of JOAN MARIE HAGGER'I‘Y, new President of Women’s
Athletic Association.
