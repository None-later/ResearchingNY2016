By DON BURNS

 

Going to take time today to glue
out with some chatter that has some
good points for the general sports
situation at state.

Last year's Soccer team posted a
very commendable record in their
first real season of competition.
’l’hree of the men were worthy of
All State honors. an indication of
the talent that this college boasts
and of the fine coaching ability of
Joe Garcia, the Ohio wonder-boy!
One of the highlights of the sched-
ule for next Fall will be their tussle
with RPI. The Engineers are sup-
posed to be loaded with Latin Am-
erican booters who really can play
the game. This could be a game for

the Fed kickers to point for . . .

The Bowling team is sure to gar-
ner a bit of cash from their Elmira
trip . . . why not keep the mould
and send the '51-‘52 team to the
National intercollegiate Tourney
next winter? ’l‘hcy are deserving of
the honor. . . .

Congratulations to Joan Haggerty
and Bob Brown on their election
to the presidencics of the respective
Athletic Associations, . , . know they
will carry on in the same good stylc
"Rock" and Phyl Harris gave us
this year!

While passing out bouquets, i
want to give due recognition to our
Cheerleaders for this year . . . these
gals did a tremendous job at all the
games and were devoted to their
task. Thanks a million girls!

This is the cud of the road for a
number of" guys and gals who have
done quite a bit for athletics at
Stat: in their few years here and
I know they will be misscd by all.
We are still moving up the lnddcr
in sports and can thank the Class
of 1951 for a number of fine contri-
billions.

'l‘hc wrestling team has shown its
prowess and is (ll-serving of" a more
formidable schedule next year. It
wouldn’t take too much money or
effort to send a few rcprcscntativcs
to the Eastern Seaboard Tourney
next January . . . let's keep this in
mold whrn wc takc that votc on the
scparatc incorporation of MAA.

One thing for sure . . . tllc people
in this college would go brokc at a
race track . . . not one person mcn-
tioncd thc llfllllC of the firsf thrcc
horses in the Dcl'by on thcir cn-
trics for last wcek's contest. . .

They just fade away.

This overworked and over-

appropos for the 1M volleyball
situation here at State.

As a result of forfeiting two
games. the Things became the
third team to be dropped from
the league. Five other teams
have forfeited one game and as
a result the league play has
been decidedly injured.

League manager Frank Fay
has requested that any team
that knows it will not. be able
to field a team got in contact
with him so that the remain-

The league playoffs have been

Rodgers Hospitalized By Wild Pitch,

For the third time this season,
the State College Baseball team will
play host on a Saturday afternoon.
this time to New Paltz, tomorrow at
2:30 in Bleeker. Coach Merlin W.
Hathaway will probably give the nod
to William D. McCormack, the slen-
der righthanded slinger from Mid~
dl-etown, who is in quest of his sec.-
ond win. Thus far, he has sustained
two of the team's three losses.
Rodgers “Beaned”

On Tuesday, the statesmen drop-
ped a twin bill at Oneonta, but the
loss of these games was greatly
overshadowed by an unfortunate ac-
cident. Fran Rogers. the likeable
little first baseman. was felled by a
fast ball while batting in the sixth
inning of the first game causing
the hospitalization of one of the
most popular members of the base-
ball squad. and in all probability.
his loss is for the season. Al; pres-
ent. Rodgers is resting comforta-
bly here in Albany and will have
to remain at rest for a week before
resuming normal activities.

 Frosll First Sackcr Out For Season

originally rained out and thus re-
played in Oneonta, the Peds drop-
ped a Well-played contest to Hart-
wrck, 7-4. Scallia, the home team's
hurler, exhibited an untouchable
assortment of pitches, his most ef-
fective being drops and curves. Mc-
Cormack, who had started for State.
lost his touch in the third frame,~
and after issuing three free tickets
to first, was relieved by Bob Haus-
ner. Although Hausner managed to
get out of the inning, he was touch-
ed for a pair of runs in the sixth
and seventh stanzas, and thus sus-
tained his first loss of the season.
MeCormack Fails Again

_In the second half of the bargain
bill, ‘lron Man" McCormack, still
had not found the touch he lost in
the first game. Two hits, two walks
and a hit batsman garnered One-
onta State a three run lead, which
was augmented by a like quantity
in the second frame. In the third
Egert assumed the hurling chores
and lasted unscored upon for two
innings. However, in the fifth, the
roof fell in and when the dust clear-
ed. State trailed eleven to flVe. Not
only did the Feds lack pitching, but
the defense left much to be desired,
the men having contributed ten
misplays afield.
’l‘op ABC At Bleccker

On the rightcr side of life, is the
fact that going into the contest,
State had mustered a three game
winning streak, the last of these be-
ing a thriller against ABC at
Blceckel' on Monday. George Leln
twirled a neat five hitter, striking
out five and issuing no walks. The
State squad trailed 4-3 going into
the final frame, but Giordano, lead-
ing off with a walk. as he pinch-hit
for Caesnri, started the ball rolling.
Hoppcy, batting for Lein laid down
a beautiful bunt, with Giordano go-
ing all the way to third. The defense
was so surprised that no play was
made, and Hoppey was perched on
first with an infield hit. Johnson
then came through with the game-
tying single, and an ABC boot net-
ted the winning tally.
