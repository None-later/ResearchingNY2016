PACI I

Three Cheers . . .

Sunday more than three hundred Seniors and
Graduate students will be awarded degrees. There
will be much festivity and ceremony accompanying

.- \the deed. There will be speeches honoring and giv-

ing advice to those graduating. People who are
most responsible for our success in learning, earn-
ing degrees and our happiness will sit in the back-
ground. These are our teachers, our parents and
,our alumni.

No doubt, most students are aware that State
College has an alumni, an active one. They know
that the alums return every June the day before
graduation and attend some kind of meetings . . .
the Quarter Century Club . . . the Half Century
Club . . . what are they?

State College owes its dormitory plan of hous-
ing, primarily, to the alums, who, remembering
their inadequate housing conditions as undergrads,
did something about it a decade ago. Now a mon-
ument to their efforts, stand Pierce and Sayles
Halls and the other dormitory facilities at State.
.It was only after State College graduates had oper-
ated these housing plants successfully for almost
ten years, that the State decided that, as Dewey
said, “students have to live, to.” The alums are
indirectly responsible for Brubacher Hall. Another
aid to undergraduates by the alumni is their loan
fund.

Marching in the traditional academic procession
with the graduates, Sunday, will be our teachers.
Any group of students graduating leaves its alma
mater with mixed feelings: glad to be finished
successfully; sad to have to break the ties of
friendship.

To realize the benefits of intellectual friendship
when the contact is finished is labeled sentiment-
alizing. But without the counseling, the aid in
learning experiences, and friendship of our teach-
ers A.B.’s and M.A.'s wouldn‘t happen.

Realization of teachers’ service, demonstration
of good teaching is most heartfelt when the teach-
er leaves the profession to retire. Four of our
faculty who are leaving, give us this feeling. Harry
Birchenough, who has been teaching math for
44 years; C. A. Hidley, who has been teaching
history for 36 years; Terrill who has been teach-
ing Commerce for 21 years and Milton Nelson who
has been at State for 25 years, are four people
esteemed and respected in their respective fields, as
well as human beings.

Sitting in the crowds, Sunday, will be our par-
ents. Even sociologists say the family is the most
convenient way to perpetuate the race and bring
up the young. Students know that families and
especially parents are the biggest factor in de-
termining what a person is. Students also know
that. in order to make better persons of their chil-
dren. parents make many sacrifices. Although for
four years all that Mom and Dad have heard frotn
their Still away at college are short-inoney-demand-
ing notes. Now your son would like to thank you.
Perhaps, it would be fitting if sons and daughters
presented their graduation to their Fathers; for
Father's Day, 1951.

State College can do well to welcome back its
successful. serviceful alumni; saddened at the
thought of losing some of its best teachers; and
feel a little inadequate for having such fine par-
ents. State College can do well to welcome back
its alums and welcome its parents.

’51 Not Faced
With Depression,
Expounds Rush

“The Class of ’51 is not faced. as
were we in ’31, with the threat of
enforced idleness due to any eco-
nomic depression. Whether we are
to have peace or war or prolonged
tension. there will be enough for

everybody to do for a long time to

come. There does hang over the
Class of ’51 (and the rest of us, for
that matter) the threat of World
War Ill—but this time we know it.
and our personal lives are being
vitally affected by the knowledge.

“The Class of ’51 graduates into
a world situation of great peril and
great promise. This is not com»
mencement rhetoric but demon-
strable fact. The job ahead: to re-
move the peril and to fulfill the
promise.”

So speaks Dean Rusk in the June
3, 1951 issue of the New York Times
Magazine. Rusk, Assistant Secretary
of State for Far Eastern Affairs. is
a 1931 graduate of Davidson Col-
lege. North Carolina. He speaks to
the graduates of 1951 as a represen-
tative of the class of 1931. and he
challenges.

“The Class of ’51 is being tossed
into a. kaleidoscopic, whirl of events.
The shape of particular issues and
problems will change rapidly; yes-
terday’s good conclusions may not
fit tomorrow's new situation. There
will he gains and losses. good news
and disappointments. satisfaction
and anxiety. We who are only a
little further along the path can-
not promise you. the men and wom-
en of ’51, that we can remove your
worries—at best we can help you
to worry more efficiently."

Of the two main problems that
faced the class of ’31. says Rusk,
that of finding employment has
been eliminated. Their other prob-
lem, only partially solved. was that
of liquidating the left-over prob-
lems of World War I. Today's prob-
lem, says Rusk, is in coping with
the great peril. the Soviet Union.
The great promise of the future lies
in the United Nations, and in the
action being taken by the free
world outside the formal framework
of the United Nations.

“In any event, World War II
came upon us and Americans blan-
keted the earth to fight for our sc-
curity—North Africa, Iceland. Gua-
dalcanal, Burma. New Guinea, An-
zio, Normandy, the Rhineland. As-
sam, Attu, Saipan. and all the rest.
It might be well for every county
courthouse in the land to post a
map of the world showing where
the young men and women of the
county 'went during World War II
to establish peace. The doctrine of
isolation (lied a violent death. Col-
lective security as a basic American
national policy was finally born.
The lesson appeared to be well
learned—and it had been paid for
in American blood."

in Winning Tally

A last inning Duffus to Lamp-
man to Whetherby triple play
snuffed out a rally by Potter Club.
gave Dave Clark a 5-0 victory, his
second of the series, and gave the
Beavers the Intramural Softball
Championship.

After losing the first game of a
best two out of three series by the
score of 7-4, the Beavers came back
to take the next two by scores of
3-1 and 5—0 mainly due to the fine
hurling of Clark, who, after a
shaky first game had almost per-
fect control throughout the rest of
the series. Dave yielded 12 walks
and seven' runs in the first game
and only three walks and one run
in the last two games.

Lampman Drives in Winning Runs

It was a single down the third
base line with the bases full in the
third inning of the last game by
George Lampman that drove in two
runs which gave Clark enough of a
lead to hold on to. Kenney George
followed with another base hit to
drive in the third run of the inn-
ing off Pete Telfer who won the first
game. Potter collected seven hits
but seriously threatened only once;
this happened in the last of the
seventh when they loaded the bases
with no outs on‘y to have Kerby
line to Duffus for the start of the
end for Potter Club; for Duffus was
to turn the low line drive into a
triple play, the first such play in
over four years at State.
Lampman. Bernard Homer

Lampman and Lou Bernard
wasted home runs in the opener as
Telfer bested Clark in a wild and
poorly played opening game. Both
hits came off the fast ball pitching
of Teller who was not up to his
usual form during the series. The
second game saw the Beavers com-
pletely outplay Potter but faulty
running on the base paths kept
them down to a 3-1 victory. Clark
the master all the way never was
in any serious trouble and had his
change-of—pace working for him.
Bob Kerby was or. the tnound for
Potter but had trouble in finding
the plate and was belted by the
Beavers almost at will. However, he
was saved by the bad running of
the victors.

The final game matched Clark.
With a one and one series record
against Telfer. and once again
Clark had it when needed. He issued
only one walk in this game and
with fine fielding support pitched
the first championship shutout
sniee before the war.

Dropping five out of their last
six games, the State Varsity base-
ball squad finished, the 1951 season
with a 4-8 record.

Hathaway's charges. usually find-
ing their hits in the right places,
had trouble holding down the op-
position’s offensive, and invariably
ended up on the short end of a
high-scoring game.

Closing out their season at Pots-
dam. the Statesman dropped a 12-8
slugfest to the hard-hitting North-
erners. Bob Hausner started on the
hill for Albany. and went 5 1/3 inn-
ings, giving up 10 hits and all
twelve runs. Larry Daly finished
up. giving two singles the rest of
the way. Harry Johnson. with two
walks. two singles, and a double,
Torn Hoppey. with a single, double,
and triple. and Don MacDonald,
with three singles. led the Albany
attack.

On the day before. at Plattsburgh,
the Feds dropped a 9-5 battle to
the Red and White of Plattsburgh
State. Herb Egert, outstanding in
previous appearances, started, but
he couldn't get by the second inn-
ing. Red McCormick mopped up,
but it was too late. as Plattsburgh
scored six times in the second. Bob
Garrow held Albany to four scat-
tered hits.

Garrow did even better in the
Plattsburgh team’s previous appear-
ancc against State. at Blocker Sta-
dium. as he pitched a one hit, 8-0
