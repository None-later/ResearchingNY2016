CLAIRE HAVEN

 

Prexy Leads '51
To Watery Grave

Hot dogs and tired dogs

marked the beginning of the‘

Senior weekend yesterday as the
class of ’51 was lead by proxy
Dutch to the famed six-mile
water works for their last picnic
as undergrads.

Unable to play the piano, our
president decided everyone
should provide his and her own
entertainment . . . and so all
the illustrious Seniors amused
themselves as only Seniors can
do . . . there was a return of
that tamous game; field-trips
and several Seniors found
themselves in the refreshing
waters led there by “Esther
Williams" Fenzel.

After several innings of soft-
ball, several gulps oi' soda. sev-
eral dips in the water, and sev-
eral mosquito bites the green
and blue (from the water)
Seniors decided that it was
time to go home and get set
for the rest of the last week-
end. (ed. note—sometimes called
lost.)

whitewash over the home club. Don
MacDonald’s fourth inning double,
with one out, spoiled Garrow's bid
for a no-hitter. MacDonald and Al
Kaehn who walked in the sixth and
advanced on an error by the
Burghers second sacker, were the
only statesmen to reach second.
Garrow struck out eleven men.

In Albany’s last victory of the
season, Herb Egert pitched an eight
hitter, to help the local club to a
6-4 decision over Harpur College at
Endicott. The State nine had to
overcome a 3-2 deficit by scoring
four runs in the last two innings.

In previous games, Oneonta top-
ped State 9-6, and New Paltz trim-
med the Peds by the same count.

Final batting averages for the
season:

Johnson .571. Hoppey .400, Car-
ter .302, Kaehn .279. MacDonald
.262. Giordano .233. Cannon .192,

College Spirit Stays
Strong Via Alumni

As Commencement approaches
and the Seniors look back over their
college days. they agree that:
state College has better equipped'
them to earn a living, has made
them a more effective personality,
has standards of which they may
be proud, and has meant a great
deal to them in the past four years
in many ways. And so, they join
the great army of State Alumni—
over 10,000 strong.
