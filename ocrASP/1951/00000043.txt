It's Yours . . .

Frosh Camp is once again over and State Col-
lege has welcomed three hundred and twenty-five
freshmen. A Senior can look at this incoming class
and inform them that they have been offered the
greatest opportunities that any freshman class has
had the privilege of receiving.

In a period of approximately two years State
College has expanded tremendously, not only in
the enrollment of the school but also in the faci-
lities which it now offers to the Student Body.
The dream of a College Union (a committee was
started in 1945), adequate facilities for the com-
merce department, the centralizations of the vari-
ous departments, and a more usable library are
among the conveniences which are now in exist-
once.

The new College Union with its many pleasant
rooms was built for the purpose of serving the
needs of the students. Take advantage of the fa—
cilities which it offers; don’t leave State College
regretting that you didn‘t spent your time worth-
while. However, remember that it is your Union——
take care of it in a manner which it deserves——
you’ll be carrying Otit the traditions of a typical
State Student.

We Explain . . .

This year the college bookshop will no longer
Operate on a co-op basis, which has been the pro-
cedure for the last four semesters. Approximately
eleven hundred individuals or one-half of the pat-
ronizers of the book store, which includes the fac-
ulties and students of Milne School and State Col-
lege, joined the dividend system.

Due to the Fair Trades Act, the co-op is forced
to sell Some of its merchandise at the same price
that it could be purchased in a regular retail store.
Previously, any profits which were made, after
deducting the cost of operation, were turned back
to the members of the co-op iii the foriii of divi-
dends at the end of the year. Those students and
faculty who didn‘t enroll in this system were act-
ually aiding those who did become members of the
Cft-OP- 

The Board of Directors of the corporation, of
which the college bookstore is a member. made a
decision to discontinue the dividend fund and re-
place that system with the allocation of the sur-
plus at their discretion to various organizations
(such as the College L'nion and li‘rosh Camp) in
order that more students may benefit frotn our
bookstore.

 

We should like to extend ottr sympathy to
the family of (‘hestcr j. Terrill who died
_luly 20, 1951. During a period of twenty-one
years Mr. Terrill devoted faithful service, not
only in the teachingr profession, btit also as
a patient and kind adviser to the students of
State College.

()ne of the many contributions which he
made to the student body was his offering
of sound financial advice to Student liotll‘fl
of liiiiaiicc. Ilc capably fulfilled the positions
of 'l‘reasurcr of the .\1umni .-\ssociation and
'I'rcastirt r of the Holding Corporation. The
students of State ('ollcgc will long remem-
ber and respect .\1r. Terrill as a teacher atid
a friend.

Maybe some of you State students
are wondering why many upper-
classmen are willing to spend part
of their hard-earned money to be
counsellors at frosh camp. A good
question . . . and it deserves some
careful answers. Believe me. there
are many! We believe that frosh
camp benefits the freshmen tre-
mendously. and we want to con-
tribute in our own small way to its
success.

Let's agree that State is about
the most informal and friendly col-
lege there is, n’est-oe pas? Well,
frosh camp is the first opportuni-
ty that freshmen have to observe
these qualities . qualities that
we soon learn to take almost for
granted.

Our faculty is fun-loving, too,
and out at camp they really let
their hair down. Where else could
you see Dean Stokes, along with
four other faculty memers, parti-

And how about Dr. Lester's dra-
matic talent? Take it from me, the
fresh appreciate knowing that our
faculty is really human!

This year at women's camp we
had the traditional Candlelight
Service . . . quite a sight! A non-
denominational Chapel service
that brought members of all relig-
ious groups together in prayer.
With the sky as otir roof and the
ground as our floor. it was impos-
sible to feel anything but peace.

Sports constitute a major portion
of the camp program. Teamwork
becomes more obvious as the days
wear on. Soon the fresh invent
games of their own—stranding a
counsellor in the middle of the lake
in a canoe without paddles, or even
turning over a Senior's bunk and
putting it outside the cabin. The
kids learn fast!

Camping on the whole is a level-
ing process whereby everyone is ac-
cepted on her character. friendli-
ness, and sportsmanship rather
than tnoncy, clothes or background.
Blue jeans and shirts are the tini-
forin of the day. atid so only the

inner qualities of a person are
judged.
We are anxious that the frosh

learn to appreciate the friendly at—
mosphere of State so that they will
be able to become part of it atid
pass it on to each succeeding class.
Frosh camp. in my estimation, ac-
complishes tlii.s goal.

Cobb Announces Policy
For Library Extension

Several changes have been made
in the college library and classroom
facilities. The college library has
now been extended to include the
former Commons in lower Hawley.
New Commerce rooms have also
been added to Draper Hall by way
of the extension in the rear of the

According to Mary E. Cobb, Col-
lege Librarian. the library exten-
sion will be a reserve reading room
where all education books will be
kept on open file so as to facilitate
service. Both reserve and loan books
except those in the 200‘s and 400's
may be obtained in this department.
The library in Hawley will serve as
a reading and reference room where
reference books and bound periodi-
cals will be kept.

The procedure for acquiring a
book will be to use the reference
cards in the catalog file in Hawley.
The title, author. and call number of
the desired book should be written
on a call slip and given to the Li-
brarian in the reading room in low-
or Hawley. Miss Cobb has announc-
ed.

The Commerce building extension
to the north of Draper Hall has
been organized to house the An-
cient and Modern Language Dc—
partinents and the Mathematics Dc-
partnient as well as the Commerce
Department. The Social Studies De-
partment. is located on second and
third floor of Draper Hall. while the
departments of English and Edu-
cation are in Richardson. A list of

“Hurray. hurray. we're going

This time we’re going away to
the annual President's Reception.
Friday. September 28. Freshmen will
be escorted to the main lounge at
Brubacher. not by white-coated
men, but by their big sisters and
brothers.

“All dressed up like a Christmas
package" means best bib and tuck-

to model their dreamy new Paris
creations. But if limited summer
earnings make that creation only
a dream. literally. don't feel blue.
Take the little black number from
the closet. don hat. heels. and
gloves. and you will be all set.

That "Christmas package look"
shouldn't be taken to heart by the
male population. How shocking if
they should turn up sporting green
trousers, red jackets. and argyles
and ties to match. For men the neat
conservative look is best.

While attire is important, it isn‘t
the principle aim of the reception.
The basic purpose is to enable frosh
