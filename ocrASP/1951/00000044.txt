it for you soon.

 

It has been a long and lonely August and September, but Mon-
day we were gratified to find that once again we were having
difficulty hearing ourselves think, that we were endorsing
Freshman checks made out for astronomical sums, that there
were once again students in NYSCT.

For these returning students who have forgotten the Co-op (as
if anyone. could) and for the new students we present, for your
examination, a partial list of Co-op supplies and services:

SU PPLI E15
BINDERS: (00¢ and up)

Loose leaf binders come in assorted sizes, 11 x 81/2, 101/13 x 8,
9 x 6, 81,9 x 51/; inches. The prices range from 60c to $3.75 and
no one can beat the quality.

ZIPPER BINDERS: ($1.50 and cup)

The government (federal) considers zipper binders as lug-
gage and they have placed a 20% tax on these items. But even
if the government gets their 20% , you still can’t get better buys
than ours. Prices $1.50 and tax and up. Jule for the best in
leatherand Stebco for the best in plastics. (Stebco products are
unconditionally guaranteed for FIVE YEARS.

TYPEWRITERS: ($68.00 and up. Rental
$4.501 mo. for portable $5.001 mo."
for standards)

Everyone cannot afford a new typewriter, but for those who
can, let us say, we carry only the best, Royal and Smith-Corona.
We also buy used machines, rent machines, etc.

GYM EQUIPMENT:

These ‘men taking gym will find ii complete line of gym
equipment in the Co-op at fair prices.

's'Eii'c‘ci" SUPPLIES:

Of course we carry school supplies from pencils to scotch-
tape, ink to pens, tillers to mimeo. You name it. If We are out
of stock temporarily on any item, you can be sure we will have

By DON BURNS

An open letter to the CIaSS of
1955 . . .

You are quite fortunate to be the
ﬁrst class to enter the "new" State
College. Our new buildings are won—
derful and will certainly be given all
the care and respect that this stu—
dent body has; they are the result
of a lot of hard work by our Col-
legs and State leaders. These new
conveniences are something that
have arisen from an exterior source
other than the student body itself;
true, we are paying fees for the
service rendered, but it is not be-
yond our reasoning to know that
it is an advantage that was given
to us, not something we created
ourselves.

The present student body has
done a bang-up job in creating
something that is really essential
to any college. They have helped
to liuild an athletic program a ma-
jority of the college takes pride in.
They have worked hard on this pro-
ject and are producing better re-
sults with each succeeding year. The
present upperclassmen have given
their time. effort, and even their
dollars, to secure the present set
up. We have no great teams or any
hopes of producing them. We are
a small college and we know it, but
we also know that “good things
come in little packages."

Three years ago, this school had
one major varsity sport and that
was mediocre, to say the least In
the succeeding years, we have added
two varsity sports which have been
nothing but successful. Joe Garcia's
Soccer and Wrestling teams have
gained added laurels for our college.
Our Bowling team made a clean
sweep of the Intercollegiate League
ard really "cashed in" at the New
York State Tournament. The Men‘s
Athletic Association has been freed
of the shackles Student Association
held over it. The interest and cali-
bre of play in the IM cycle has
picked up immensely. It cannot be
denied that our sports program is
growing in quality as well as in
quantity. There is no better blue
print for your class to follow.

This expansion is an expression
of the pus iii student body's dc-
sires to raise our athletic program
to the prominence it deserves. We
are still in the growing stage and I
urge you to utilize that which we
have created for ourselves with the
same enthusiasm you have shown
for our other “new” additions.

We cannol ask for better co-op-
ei'uiion from the Administration.
President Collins and Mr. l'iitLlltl-
way have >|l(‘lll many an hour
working on this opei'nlioir It is on
All-College movement illlll war—
i'nnls your intention and supporl.
I hope you (“till do n“ lillli'll lol‘

through ‘5-1 have done, are doing.
niid will do. THE OPPORTUNITY
IS YOURS, TAKE ADVANTAGE

the squad will probably be chosen
from George Smelling, Walt Reh-
der, Hank Berleth, Ben Button,
Phil Billings, Danny Joy, Ed Costll-

all of whom are veterans of last
year‘s squad.

Also seeking varsity berths are
the following upper classmen: Art
Goldin, Dick Tennyson, Pete Tel-
fer, Jim Bailey, and Fran Rodgers.

Army Highlights Season

This year's schedule will be fea-
tured by a game with Army’s J. V.
hooters. If the Statesmcn can turn
in a successful showing in this can-
test. there is a good possibility that
in ‘52 they will get a crack at the
West Point Varsity and perhaps
become a regular part of the Army
schedule. Another soccer power-
house that State will take on is
Brockport State Teachers, an out-
standing soccer school of the East.

This season‘s slate consists of
eight games. with two open dates,
a possible ten game total. If the
budget will allow, there will also be
a four or five game J. V. schedule
against teams in the local area.

The Junior Peds will be coached
by Dave Wetherby and include
among its members Fran Schatzle.
Dick Bailey, Dave McKay, Joe Mc-
Dowel], Joe Stella. George Wood.
Leonard Lewis, and Donald Bar-
rctt. At the time this edition went
to press, these men were still com-
peting for varsity berths. and some
of them may help to round out the
10 or 18 man squad Garcia intends
to carry, ~

(‘oiieli Works Hard on Schedule

Joe has done an exceptional job
in comprising such a fine card of
games. Handicapped by the budget
procedure. he had to turn down
possible contests with such Metro-
politan powers as Pratt, Queens
College, and Brooklyn College as
well as other strong soccer squads
in the New England States. At
present he is negotiating with a
couple of these schools in an effort
to fill the two open dates on our
schedule.

The season finale with Plattsburg
State will be an animal affair. This
move was adopted by both schools
to create a competition that will
be both consistent and friendly.
