Japanese Reverses I'Go West”,
Comes East For Re-Orientation

Don’t turn over in your grave,
Horace Greely, but your motto is
all Wet. The United States Army.
working in affiliation with the In-
stitute of International Education,
has replaced “Go West, young man
with a beckoning “Come East.
young and old men and women."

This all adds up to one thing: a

Sliaw Assists Parley
As Special Interpretor

Dr. Edward Shaw. Professor of
Modern Languages, returned Thurs—
day, September 13, from a two day
conference in New York City. There
he acted as interpreter for Tran
Van Huu. Prime Minister of Viet-
Nam ni Indo China.

Dr. Shaw attended the conference
and served in this capacity at the
request of Governor Dewey's sec-
retary. For two days it was his duty
to interpret for Van Huu and for
the twelve others in his delegation,
who came to New York after at-
tending the peace parley in San
Francisco.

 

Erientation prograni— for students

from Japan and the Ryuku Islands.
What has all this to do with State
College? Because of this program
we now have in our midst. a young
Tokyoite, Yurio Kobayashi.

With 449 others, Yurio arrived in
San Francisco this June. They were
quite a varied crew, though most-
ly male (only eighty women). with
ages ranging from nineteen to for-

San Francisco wasn’t altogether
strange to Yurio since he had been
born there. Having left the city
at six years of age, he found many
surprises. One was the abundance of
automobiles. Yurio saw. not stars.
but cars. and plenty of them. Yet
he came to realize that in a large
city a car was more than just an-
other luxury; it became a necessity.

“They think they are so poor.
but they are so rich." commented
Yurio Kobayashi about our Ameri-
can students. Even if we have to
work our way through college. we
have such tremendous facilities.
And after taking a gander at Bru-
bacher. how right he is!
