Visitor Unearihs
Unique Energy

Drooplng shoulders, dragging
steps, bags under the eyes-—
could these be the manisfesta-
tions of energy?

Professor Kortcweg, a. recent
visitor to State who teaches the
theory of economics at Vollen-
dam University in the Nether-
lands, says we Americans are
the most energetic and re-
sourcei’ul students in the world.
Speaking on economics to ap-
proximately one thousand home-
bound American students on
board a ship of the Dutch lines.
Professor Korteweg drew this
conclusion. Granted. economics
takes energy. but it seems
Americans aren't the only en-
ergized specimens of man kind.
Professor Kortcweg casually re-
marked that Dutch students
spend approximately seven
years in college.

Perhaps we use all of our en-
ergy in the process of looking
energetic. What do you think?

RPI SCRIMMAGE OPENS SOCCER SEASON

 

144 I see it

By DON BURNS

 

Last year basketball practice start-
ed October I. and the candidates
were allowed to compete in [M
Football. The club lost its first nine
games, most of them in the fading
minutes. They undoubtedly were a
tired ball club. It wasn‘t the fact
that a majority of the team played
football that caused them to rim
out of gas, but this year they will
not be allowed to play. The Varsity
will still start practice about the
same time. Let‘s be practical Coach.
no team needs two months of prac-
tice for our schedule and tile guys
would be a happier lot if all were
allowed to play in the IM loop!

Going to stick my neck out arid
pick the upset oi‘ the weekend . . .

Tomorrow the Soccer team opens
at RPI. let‘s all go over there and
get the boys off on the right “foot”.
It helps any ball club to know they
have support and no team deserves
it more than Joe Garcia and his
Peds. The game is only an ex-
hibition but will give the spectators
a lot of action and will also give
them all opportunity to view the
Engineer's prize South American
competitors. These boys are being
groomed for All—American honors
to add to the laurcls they acquired
South of the Border.

Received a card from last year‘s
Sports Editor and columnist. llar-
vey Milk; he is a member of the
It. S. Navy at present. I imagine he
is quite happy about his Yanks all
but stumbling to their third straight
flag. If the Old l’ros get to file
Series. it’s this writer's opinion they
won't retain their World Champion-
ship. It will be the Giants in five
or the Dodgers in six. You don‘t
have to take my word for if . . .
