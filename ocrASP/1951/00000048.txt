Problem-Solving

To Peaceful Education Workshop

Problems, problems. problemsi
Solving them is a frequent chore in
the teaching profession. To escape
from this fatiguing routine. several
members of the faculty hibernated
to a three-day workshop at peaceful
Westport Inn on the shores of Lake
Champlain.

Dr. Don A. Orton. Dr. James
Childers, Dr. Milton 0. Olson, Dr.
J. T. Phlnney. and Edward Sabol
were in the group of escapees. These
men did not loaf all the time. how-
ever. for a workshop is exactly what
its name implies. Means to improve
various areas in the field of educa-
tion were discussed.

Believe it or not. some future
practice teachers may escape the
fate of instructing Milne students.
since it was decided at the work-
shop that mor-e students should
have an opportunity to teach off
campus. More field and laboratory
experiences may supplement off
campus teaching. Won't that be fun?

Here is some advice to anyone
who thinks he might want to work

Judicial Body Declares
Debate Election Void

(Continued from Page 1, Column 1)

from Monday through Saturday.
Until the beanies arrive. they will
be required to wear class ribbons.

At a meeting Wednesday night
Myskania declared Debate Council
elections of last spring void. Debate
Council had been operating under
two constitutions. only one of which
was on file with Student Council.
However. the elections were held in
accordance with the new constitu-
tion which had not been submitted
to the Council. According to the con-
stitution of Student Association.
“The duties of Student Council shall
be . . . to require changes in the con-
stitutions of organizations receiv-
ing support through the S. A. bud-
get." and “The duties of Myskania
shall be . in open court to try
individuals or organizations charg—
ed with having violated a regula-
tion. These individuals or organiza-
tions shall be brought before Mys-
kania by the organization charged
with enforcing the regulation which
has been violated.“ Because the
constitution of Debate Council had
not been ﬁled with Student Council,
the elections were voided.
