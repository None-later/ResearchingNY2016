Wondering Visitor
Stupities Students

'l‘otally unaware of the asteri—
isherl stares of students. the
distinguished looking visitor
ambled down the aisle of the
Education class. Ignoring dras—
tic results to ills brown and
white coat. he reclined on the
floor and prepared himself for
an hottr of comfortable listen-
ing.

He didn‘t even take notes. He
was incapable of it. having no
text. no notebook, not so much
as it scrap of paper. The pro-
fessor. unaware of this creature,
continued his lecture. while stu-
dents remaiiied stupcl'ied.

What was his purpose? Was
he a spy l‘or sortie subversive or—
ganization. it Kefiiuvcr agent.
or a McCarthy fun? No one
know.

The bell rang. The visitor
arose, stretched himself. and
wandered out of the room. The
mystery was soIVcd. lie was just.
a lonely, tll'cd, ovcrsizcd mon-
grel who found ltoorii ill a
wonderful pliice to forget his
woes and take it mid-morning

lection are the type which do not
go out of date. They include Shake—
sperlan plays, classical music, and
semi-classical works. Most of them
are the regular '78 R.P.M.'s tRev-
olutions Per Minute), but the new-
est are the long-playing 33 1-3
type.

This collection was started by
members of the faculty who do-
nated the records used in their
classes. The rest have been pur-
chased with funds allotted from the
library budget.

These records are catalogued in
a regular card catalogue according
to title, composer, director, and
there is a bl‘OWSll’lg list, if you
don't happen to have a particular
record in mind. The borrowing rules
are the same as for reserved books;
any card holder in good standing
may borrow records for overnight
or over a week end. Now, before you
tear off to Mrs. Pltler tin charge
of the collection, who recommends
that you place your requests as far
in advance as possiblet, remember
that you can't play these without
a record player. If you don't have
one, the library can't do anything
for yoti; it has no facilities for lis-
tening.

Good music is a lasting expres-
sitill of the human sottl. In State
College we have a collection span-
ning three centuries of magnificent.
musical and dramatic compositions.
If you enjoy music and want to
hear selections beyond the range of
your own pilvate collection. your
opportunity is staring you in the
face.

Unlorseen Events
Cause Champlain

To Alter Schedule

The State College Varsity Soc-
cer opening game scheduled for 2
o'clock tomorrow at Beverwyck Park
has been postponed and will be
played on October 23. This unhappy
state of affairs came about as a
result of aoministrationai difficult-
ies at Champlain which delayed the
opening of school at that institution
until Just a few days ago.

Coaches Joe Garcia and Merlin
Hathaway have been exerting every
possible eifort to patch up this dele-
MO“ in the schedule, but at this
late note it seems rather hopeless.
it no inter-coriogiate match can
be mustered, there will be a regula-
tion Varsity-Junior Varsity tilt.

(ioldin Shows Great Promise

Despite this misfortune. there are
seine brighter spots in the State
Soccer story. The squad has been
bolstered by the addition of Don
Lein and Bob cruinley. both fresh-
men who haVe had previous ex-
perience. Iii addition the progress
shown by Art Goldin has been re-
markable. Althotigh Art has much
to learn about playing in the full
back slot, such as charging, quick
kicking with either foot and a few
other finer points of the game, he
has shown a tremendous ability to
learn fast. and should turn otit to
be one of the inatnstays of the
squad.

Veterans Spark Squad

Three other men who deserve
for more than jtist passing praise
are Ben Button, Al Caution, and
Ralph Adams. Button‘s steady play
at any position on the field. Can-
non's fight and hustle and Adam‘s
driving spirit have been a colossal
lift for the team, and have cer-
tainly helped Garcia in selecting
it first team. The work of this trio.
combined with Red McCormack's
soccer know-how, and the field gen-
crulshlp of Ctirly Strickland are all
reflections of the tithe and effort
put in by Coach Joe Garcia and
the spirit. he has instilled in his
men.

'l‘cam Stresses Position Play

For the past. week the squad has
been ironing out the inefficiencies

look llil‘ it good season is in the off-
