To Naoshi Koriyama, State Col-
lege is a wonderful place. He even
likes it better than the University
of New Mexico, where he studied
last year. Why? He admits the rea-
son is purely non-academic, but he
is delighted with our numerous,
varied receptions.

A long way from home, Naoshi
doesn't feel too strange because he
has known many Americans. This
native of the Oshima Islands, which
are a part of the Ryuku Islands.
secured his knowledge of Americans

by working with the United States
military government on Okinawa.

After taking several competitive
examinations, he was one of fifty-
two Japanese students chosen to
spend a year of study in the United
States. inis year of study was spon-
soi‘eu oy the United States Army
working co-jointly with the lusti-
tme or international Education.

The group sailed to San Francis-
co m the early summer of 1950. The
world is a small place; if Naoshi
liau sailed a year later, he would
have oeen on the same ship with
Yurio Eobayashi, another Japanese
student at State.

The informality and friendliness
of students in America please Na-
oshi. He is also impressed by the
close ties existing between the fac-
ulty members and students.

Fortunately for State, Naoshi
Koriyama had decided to complete
his educational career in this coun-
try. and more specifically, at State.
A social studies major, his main
difficulty lies in getting his reading
assignments finished on time Don‘t
worry, Naoshi. we all have that
problem.

Skidrnore Plans
New Laboratory

A Phonetics Laboratory is being
set up in Room 242, Draper, accord-
ing to Dr. James W. Childers, Pro-
fessor of Modern Languages. It will
be equipped to record sounds and
practice work of phonetics students
in Modern Languages. Dr. Willard
E. Skidmore, Professor of Modern
Languages. is in charge of the lab-
oratory.

The equipment will be used prim—
arily by the phonetics classes in
French and Spanish. It is hoped
that the facilities will soon be open
to all French. Spanish, and Ger-
man students so they may use the
recorder to improve their pronun-
elation.

At present the laboratory is
equipped with several solo phones
and a. victrola. The solo phones
will enable the students to practice
without annoying others in the
room. A record collection has been
started which includes Linguaphone
records and the Henry Holt spoken
Russian records that are being used
by the army to teach Russian to its
personnel. “Army method" teach—
ing records have been ordered for
use in the laboratory and are ex—
pected to arrive soon.

Brubacher Bar [Pads]  

Turns Tavern

So you think you're going to
the snack bar tonight? Well,
you're not. You’ll be eating at
Temperance Tavern, the win-
ning name in a contest recently
held to rename said sumptuous
site.

If you notice that Jerome
Murtha, a freshman, is getting
heavier as the days go by, even
though he’s skipping lunches.
it’s because he’s the lucky win-
ner of ten dollars worth of cof-
fee. cokes. hamburgers. frank-
i‘urters. sundaes. milk shakes,
and a carton of cigarettes. He
won over such names as Bru
Bar, Refresh Inn. The Snack
Shack. The Think Sink. The
Galley. and even Sicna Hall. not
to mention the 2] suggestions
submitted by one enterprising
girl in the Junior Class.

Well. Jerome. you'll soon be
the most popular freshman at
State. Be seein' you at the tav-
ern.

Statesmen Open
Soccer Schedule

With Road Trip

Playing a team that is rated
fourth in the country, the State
College soccer team will usher in
the 1951 season at Brockport at 2
p.m. today. After this contest the
Statesrnen will travel to Oswego to
complete the campaign's most
gruelling road trip with a game
against Oswego State tomorrow.
This will mark the first meeting be-
tween State and Oswego and the
second time the Pods have tangled
with Brockport.

The Brockport. squad will be led
by two All-American soccer play-
ers, Bondi and Orbaker; it was
Bondi's spectacular play as goal
keeper last year that defeated State
4-0. Not too much is known about
Oswego’s aggregation except that in
the season's opener they played
Plattsburg to a 4-4 tie. This is vir-
tually the same Plattsburg outfit
that State trounced twice last year
7-1 and 5-2.

Nunez Bolsters Squad

The Peds have been bolstered by
the return of Raoul Nunez to the
lineup. who has sparked the team
in recent practice sessions with
spectacular passing and with the
switching of Tom King from inside
left to outside left. This is perhaps
Garcia's answer to the problem of
offense. Strickland, Cannon, and
Joy have played commendable ball
at the half back slots. and with
Adams moving over to full back to
work with Art Goldin the team’s de-
fense should be greatly strength—
ened.

Garcia Lists Lineup

The starting lineup, according to
Garcia, for today's encounter will
be Peter Telfer G. Arthur Goldin
LHB. Ralph Adams RHB. Dean
Strickland CH. Alfred Cannon RH,‘
Philip Billings or Daniel Joy RH,
Raoul Nunez CF. Thomas King OR.
