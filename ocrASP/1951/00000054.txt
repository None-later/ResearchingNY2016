Hospitality?

At the Wednesday night Student Council meet-
ing a discussion was held regarding the Student
Union Board Rule which prohibits any student
from a college other than NYSCT to enter the
Student Union unless the individual is accom-
panied by a State College Student.

Friday night from 7 pm. to 1 am. approxi-
mately twenty guests visited our Union upon pres-
entation of Activities Cards from other colleges.
Students from eight different colleges (from var-
ious parts of N. Y. State, not only, the tri-city
area) visited us during the evening. Since each
guest checked in and out with the hostess, a clear
account was kept as to the number of guests and
what schools were being represented in the build-
ing by the hostesses. With the enforcement of the
Union Board rule, the hospitality which was of-
fered to our guests over the past weekend will now
be denied.

Each and every student who allows his school
to offer no hospitality should be ashamed of him-
self. Look at the situation realistically; hasn’t
the number of outsiders who are visiting us
been declining steadily? Every time that a re-
spectable student from another college is turned
away from our door, we have contributed to sever
the relations with that institution. Albany State, a
friendly college? Can Albany State, a state sup-
ported institution, afford to offer no hospitality?

The Union Board voted to allow students who
are registered in Plattsburgh State Teachers Col-
lege and are now at Nursing School in Albany to
use our Union since they had paid a similar tax.
What kind of logic is that? Because a student is
not so fortunate as to be registered in one of the
State Teachers Colleges but whose parents are
likely paying taxes to New York State, should he
not be allowed to visit the Union? If we are to
welcome one group, we are discriminating.

It also seems rather ironic that Student Coun-
cil should uphold this rule which was originated
by the Union Board. Student Council receives
money through the SA Budget to attend the [CA
conference, supposedly a group to further inter-
collegiate relations. Now that Albany has the op-
porttinity to actually further them, she closes her
doors. Apparently what has been accomplished at
ICA has not been applied. We will not gain any-
thing if we set ourselves up on a pedestal and do
not offer a welcome. There is much more to be
gained if we interact; that responsibility should
fall on the Union Board; they decided to have no
visitors.

The Board feels that the rules have been estab-
lished; strict enforcement should prevail at first
with alleviation in due time. Shouldn't the Board
when it sees another method consider it and
attempt to satisfy the student body, rather than
display a fear of the loss of power?

There is absolutely no logic in strictly enforc—
ing the rule that guests shouldn‘t be allowed in
the Union now and later alleviating this rule.
When the rule is alleviated, visitors won‘t bother
with us. Also, has any real incident occurred
which has entailed the Board to make such a rule
as far as college students are concerned? We, as
a college, are not unique as far as behavior is con-
cerned. Albany State will find that she is much
further ahead if she offers a gracious welcome.
You. as a college citizen, are responsible for scc-
ing that. she does.

ITATI COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. OCTOBER 19. 1931

Bu] 0:: 

By RAYMOND CHAMPLIN

 

Special requirements for the De-
gree of Bachelor of Arts. as taken
from the fine print of page 34 in
our beloved cat010gue—"A candi-
date for this degree must have in
high school and college a minimum
of six years of foreign languages or
must complete a minimum of four
years of foreign language in col-
lege.” Remember how fast you skim—
med over this as a. high school won-
der. lusting for a liberally arty
education. Famous last, mumbles—
they can't be serious—but they are.

Now We ask ourselves why! Is
there a transfer of knowledge from
languages to other subjects? To a
degree, certainly, but is this a prac-
tical reason for maintaining the re-
quirement? You don’t knit to keep
in shape for football. Why study
foreign languages for the benefits
you may reap in the fields of history
and English.” Are We able, through
languages. to understand and ap-
preciate the true cultural develop-
ment. custom, and mores of for-
eign peoples. Por Supesto, ifor the
benefit. of commerce majors. this
means of course. but. why spend
gruelling weeks scribbling words.
cooking up idioms. and fumbling
with vocabulary lists to solve a puz-
zle that could have been complete-
ly avoided with an English trans-
lation. The satisfaction gained in
mastering a language is costly; time
and energy are irreplaceable.

Language will be of benefit when
and if we choose to travel. Quite
true. but as beginning teachers our
financial status will definitely limit
our round the world tours. at least

To the Editor:

We are of the opinion that State
College has. up until now. been
proudly hailed as the "Friendly
College." Why. then. did our Stit-
dent Council uphold the law. which
will be the means of keeping stu-
dents from other colleges from on-
joying the privileges of our Student
Union?

In the first place. we feel that
our Student Union is something of
which we can be justly proud.
Therefore, it should not only be our
desire, but our responsibility to sec
that it is aptly displayed to per~
sons not so fortunate in having a
similar set-up to all "theirs".

Secondly. aren't we interested in
making new acquaintances? The
social contacts we could attain by
receiving our visitors graciously. we
are certain. would or- iinmcrous and
to our advantage. Not only our
women ta large iiumbcr of whom
are very frequently ciitcrtuincd by
friends from llt'ttl’li'»' t'tiiii'_‘.Sl. but
our men could enjoy making it new
friend. here and there.

As the rule stands now. no visit-
ors from other colleges will be ai-
lowcd in our Student Union. unless
thi are the particular guests of
sttititnts here at State. What. about.
those fellows who will hang around
outside Brubachcr and wait for f
gang of girls to happen along. so
that they can convince the gals to
take them in as guests. Isn't this
situation going to present a diffi—
cult problcm? After all. when we
make a ruling. it has to be one
that is definite. and circumstances
such as the above-mentioned arc
sitre to 1if you will cxcusc our vcr—
uculur. please.) louse up the works.

(.‘oniu'mctt report has ll thit six
very desirable men from u lllL‘.lll_\‘

from our door here last Saturday
night, Come on. State! Think of
what similar circumstances iii the

tion. and iiiiituiiic your reaction upon

a new ruling using discretion mid

delay them for a few years. If we
do decide at some futtu'e date to
journey to Lower Slobbovia. how
much Slobbovian do you think we
will have retained

Regardless of why we are taking
these courses. we nevertheless take
them. A soft seat far to the rear
near a, window is the choice sel-
ection. and the competition for the
above mentioned is keen. Hoping
that all those around us are also
groping in the dark. we come to find
out. that the guy sleeping in the
next seat is a language major.
tThere are three common types of
language majors. Those that go
from Sp. 2 to Sp. 9 to Cei‘rantes;
those that go from Sp. 1. to Sp. 1.
to Sp 1; and those that go from
Sp. 1. to Fr. 1. to the dean‘s of-
fice.) The guy never does his work.
sleeps in class. when he comes,
and gets As in all the tests. We
stay up all night translating. cram
for the finals. laugh at all the prof's
jokes. and get E-. And they still
say its all in your attitude.

It can't be denied that attitude.
in manv cases, is the reason for poor
linguistic achievement. but who is
to blame. The student is forced to
take courses with majors and min-
ors. a naturally frustrating situa-
tion. courses which necessitate the
expenditure of a lot of time. and
courses which take up important
space in an already busy schedule.

I have learned by the grape vine
that a student-faculty committee is
now at work, and that in the not
too distant future 'l B. S. dcgrcc may
be available to all undergrads. This
would be a blessing to all concern-
ed. teachers and students. Another
possible solution. as I see it 1500-20
vision). would be a required third
or fourth in languages with special
courses offered to those who arc
just. fulfilling the requirement.

Well. off to French class.

P. S. As for the new movie—I
like it.

The Advanced Dramatics season
opened Tuesday night with two tin-
usual productions.

The ﬁrst play. a tragedy directed
by Jim Hughes. was sensitively
handled by a well-unified cast.
headed by Bob Sanders. Sandcrs‘
cluiracterization of Malzius had iii-
finite 'ai'icty of tempo and mood;
voice. body and face combined to
produce the tiiost tortured exhibit
of pain-wracked spirits.

Orchids, too. to Ross Newman
and Ed Kyle. both of whom handled
supporting roles effectively and
forcefully. Newman's portrayal of
the soldicr was strong and brutal.
Ed Kyle‘s interpretation of the
General was pleasing l)t'Cflll.‘0 ho
wisely avoided the run-of—lhe-mill
ranting and raving by substituting
a suave, unhurried temperament.

The flashback scene with the
scientists had a few good moments.
btit was weakened by ineffectual
luind gestures and air of conspiracy
which didn't ring true, and slightly
muddled diction.

()n the whole, the staging was
good b.ut the excellence of the sci-
ting and movement was dimmcd by
faulty lighting. which often prc—
vented us from seeing facial ex—
prcssloiis.

’l‘hc .tccond play. a. satire (iii'cctcd
by Wnlly (ioodcli. was held togeth-
l‘l‘ by (‘ui'olyii Williams its Qllt‘t‘ll

antics of .lflt'k .liicolitis. Miss Wil—

(‘ollins' luck of i)l'ti_|l‘t'if(lll was an
unfortunate ucidcnt, for we were

cd to be a wry ciipalilc grasp of
character. Part of the fault must bc
ucounlcd to (‘ioodcll's stugc-iiiovc~

THE IRON CURTAIN?

Wednesday night student Council voted to uphold
the Union Board ruling that no one but State stu-
dents and their guests were to be admitted to the
Union—Frankly my dears. we think the ruling has a
bit. of a fetid odor (it stinks). It is certainly poor hos-
pitality if not downright snobbing on the part of
State to lmit the use of the Union to the select few
who have the magic Student Tax ticket.

Think about it—-enough gripes in the right direc-
tion can bring about a change. Contrary to current
notions, it is still our Union!

SWITCH?
We used to eat in the cafeteria and dance in the

Commons. Now we eat in the Commons—why don't
we dance in the cafeteria?

BRIDGE ANYONE?
We hear that ten decks of playing cards have been
“borrowed” from the Commons in the past week.

If things are that tough we will personally lend
the price of a deck of cards tat a reasonable rate of
interest. of course) to any destitute dealer.

SILENCE IS GOLDEN

We understand that a few “students” had to be
treated for shock last week after having been blasted
back to reality by that overgrown fire—alarm they're
using for a bell in the library.

Miss Cobb could make a bundle with an ear plug
concession.

MANNERS AGAIN

Since the AD plays do start at 8:15 pin. it might
make it more interesting for the audience and less
disconcerting for the cast if people would arrive at
the performance on time.

IIATS OFF

To “Little Joe“ Garcia. Friday at 2:30 pm. the
soccer team plays Syracuse at Bcvcrwyck field. Syra-
cuse. one of the three teams in the nation‘s top live
that State scheduled this year. is i‘utcd fifth in the
country. Nice work for the secoan year of soccer at.
State. It should be a good game so let‘s get. out, there
and yell for the home town favorites.

BIG TIME?

Maybe State will be playing basketball in the Wasti—
ington Avo. Armory this ycai'—--kccp your fingers
crossed.

INQUIRY

We have always thought that the responsible po-
sitions on the organizations at State wci'c achieved
by working in the. organization from the bottom tip.
'f‘hcre seems to have been a slight inixup in this sy s-
tcni in Forum and Soapbox. No one seems to know
just how a. few of the leaders in these organizations
got their offices and if they do know, tlicy are very
loath to tell anyone. 'I‘hcsc organizations should have
a fair system of tryouts and clcctions and if they
don't. thcy'd bcttcr get. one in a hurry. We sinccrcly
hopc somconc can cxpluin this inixiip.

Sock-Fooled Revellers Will Frolic
in Rural Atmosphere Af Soc-HOp

By SHIELA HILL

save your fancy clothes in the
closet and don’t even polish your
shoes, ‘cause they won't be showing
at the Commuters‘ Club Soc-Hop.
The Sock, plain or pretty, will reign
next Friday night. This will be one
dance where you can walk all over
your partner's feet, and it won't hurt
his corns a bit.

You future teachers of State will
look more like future farmers in
blue jeans and old shirts, for this
will be a truly rural party. The
country mice at College will feel
right at home when they see the
decorations the night of October
26. There will be plenty of farm-
yard atmosphere with cornstalks
and Autumn vegetables. Don’t trip
over any pumpkins!

You city mice will have a terrific
time. too. hopping from 8 'til 12 to
the music of Genial Jack and Hill
Wyoming Rangers. When you can't
stand up for another square dance.
relax with doughnuts and cider as
sweet as your date. The donation for
all this rustic pleasure is only $.65.

Gals. the best way to get a date
for the Hop is to be seen conspicu-
ously knitting large-sized argyles.
One so"k and he goes to the dance
with you; two socks and he pays for

Soccer Contest

Results In Tie

This is soccer? Why be spec-
lfic? Not only was it soc-her; it
was also sock him. it and any-
thing else that got in the path
of Myskania-ites and Gremlins
Tuesday afternoon on the Dorm
Field.

Featured in Myskanla’s line-
up were the Rock-kicks (kick-
ers who missed and plrouetted
divinely) and not-so-haggard
llaggerty. whose kicks flew way
down the field. Goalie Eade did
some pretty fancy kicking too.

Between quarters this honor
society imbibed freely from two
enormous bottles (milk), filled
with water. Fountain Robinson
took fiendish delight in sprink-
ling liis team mates.

The score was tied through
most of the game. Tenseness
gripped the crowd. Couldn’t
somebody get a goal? Myskanla
shifted tactics. First it sneaked
in an extra player, and then
wild-eyed Wiley seized the ball
and made a mad dash. “Let's go
back to soccer," suggested the
ref. extricating players from the
pile of waving arms and legs.

Finally Tom Ilogue made a
goal for the fresh. But Mys-
kllnlll's decision states that while
‘55 won the game. they got the
point for cheering. ’l‘here's noth-
ing‘ like a tie. is there?
