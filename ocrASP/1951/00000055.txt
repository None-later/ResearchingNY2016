14d .7 See It

By DON BURNS

 

The last time this school was ex-
posed to the idea of having Varsity
Football was well over a decade ago.
1987 to be exact! The great urge for
Intercollegiate Football extended as
far as a public opinion poll here on
campus and then faded under the
dominant hand of a power now
non-existent at State. Everyone
considered this idea an excellent
one, but nothing constructive avail—
ed in its favor. Granted. that an
expansion of this type would not
have been too appropriate in the
shallow days of '37, but why has the
proposition lay dormant for so
many years since then?

The old cry of tradition is noth-
ing but. tripe as far as this endeavor
is concerned because we have had
the previous honor of being rep-
resented by a football team. The
big cry is where does the money
come from to initiate such a move.

A small percentage of the cost
would naturally fall upon the Stil-
dent Body. probably in the form of
a nominal one dollar increase in
the Student Tax ticket; the increase
going directly to the AA pocket-
book. The remainder of the expense
could come from our Alumni. I'm
sure they wouldn‘t hesitate to match
our one dollar investment if asked
to do so. The Alums represent a
great untapped reservoir of support
as far as our Athletics go and would

be ﬁrst class backers of a “fool—
ball“ move here on Campus. The
initial impetus. naturally. would

have to arise here, and would have
to be long and loud enough to in-
citc action by the Administration.
This town is ripe for College foot-
ball and its present sorry sports
picture is an indication of the mar-
ket for the. gridiron game. The
plight of today's (‘apital District
sports picture stems from the inad-
equacy oi‘ spectator sports. Albany
offers two principal spectator sports
—one a 50—50 Minor League base-
ball team and the other a small
college basketball team trying to go
big time. The sentiments of the city
officials already have been felt out
and they lend a favorable hand to
this cause. thus assuring easy pro-
curement of municipal i‘aeiltii-s.
All of last year's Student Council
Presidential candidates built. their
platforms around the improvement
and fostering of our sports program.
If this is “signs of our times" why
not look into this proposition. Bill?

EEP Wins Two,-
Indians Ploy Tie
In Main Games

Six games were played in the IM
football league this week. In Wed-
nesday's encountcr‘s the Indians
and Grads tussled to a scoreless tie
on Dorm Field. George Schaertl was
just a few lcet away from an Indian
tally when a timely tackle by Serge
hrchniak thwarted his effort.

1 he Grads threw a scare into the
opposition early in the first half
when Al Gachn tossed a forty yard
pass to Jim Warden for a score
only to have it nullified because of
an offside violation.

Action on the Bcvcrwyck grid-
iron was highlighted by the 46-0
trouncing of Thurlow at the hands
of Potter Club.

The Potter scoring was led by Joe
Pcrsico. Tom Yolc, and Don Burns
who each tallied twice and Ray
Champlin who raced sixty yards on
the second play of the game. Ray
Gibb and Ray Champlin led the
passing attack as each flipped for
two T.D.‘s.

Edges Graduals

Kappa Bct.i downczl the Grads
6-0 on Tuesday on the Dorm Field.
Mort Frank. Neil Ryder and Abc
Blattmun sparked the victors. Blatt-
miin tossed to Frank for the lone
tally climuxing a downficld drive.

Al Kaehn and Jim Warden were
the bulwarks for the Grads. Scrg‘c
Kirciiiak‘s absence on defense was
i‘cli by the losers.

Potter made it two for the week
as they trimmed the Angles on
Monday 8-0. Harry Johnson was on
the receiving end of a Roy Champ—
liii pass to account for the only
touchdown. The additional two
points came as a result of Tom Sin-
gleion‘s nab of Tom Z()\\'ill:' behind
the Anch goal line. Carter‘s puni-
lllL’. set the losers on their heels
throughout the tussle.

Bonahue, Smith Tie
in Third Football Pool

For the fourth consecutive week.
we are running a contest to see who
is the football expert at State. Any-
one who has not yet tried his skill
ill predicting the outcome of the
games is urged to ill] out the cou-
pon with the scores. tear it out. and
put it in the mailbox outside of the
I‘.(). before 4:30 pm. today. The.
winner will receive a free carton of
his favorite brand of cigarettes.

Last week‘s contest resulch in a

The State Varsity Bowling
team began its season last
Thursday against the State Grad
team by defeating them 2 games
to l.
'lliis year's keglers are led by
two veteran bowlers, Carmen
Corsi and Bob Sinkledam. The
remaining members of the start-
ing five are "Red" McCormack,
Walt itchdcr, and Mitch Bur-
kowsky, all of whom were
among last year's pace setters in
State’s intramural League.

ilie teams composmg this
year’s intercollegiate League are
State. defending champions.
Pharmacy, A.B.C., and the
newly organized State College
Grad team. lncidently, this
Grad team led by Don Burt and
Bob ltciio. twu members of last
year‘s varsity champions. looms
as a leading contender for the
league. title. Sicna. last year's
runner-up, has withdrawn from
the league due to the lack of iii-
terest on the part of the Siena
students.

 

KDR Trounces Grads,
Defeated By Indians

Low-scoring games predominated
in games played over the weekend.
On Saturday KDR beat the Grad-
uates 8-6 and lost to the Indians 2-0
on Monday. Playing with only eight
men. a T1) pass to Jim Fox and a
safety were enough to win over a
determined Grad squad. On the
opening kickoff Jim Warden took
the ball and raced the length of
the field to score for the Grads.

Monday. the Indians presented a
rock—ribbed defense and handed
KDR a 2-0 licking. Again playing
short-handed KDR backed the Iii—
diaiis up against the goal line in
the first quarter but couldn't score.
The Indians came back strong and
threatened several times. just miss-
ing a touchdown by inches with 5
seconds in go. In the second half
the Indians again threatened but
could go nowhere. Fortunately for
them. a bad pass from center went
through the end-zone scoring 2
points for the Indians. Late in the
game a long ruubiick of an inter-
cepted pass by A1 Brown gave KDR
a chance. but a hard-rushing linc
prevented them from scoring as
time ran out.

State, Oswego
Battle To Draw
ln Extra Periods

The State College Varsity Sower
team will make its initial home per-
formance of the season as it plays
host to Syracuse University on Bev-
erwyck Field today at 2:30. This
late addition to the schedule was
engine-cred by Coach Joe Garcia last
week. and should give the home
crowd an ample chance to View the
locals against some top-flight com-
petition. The Statesmen wnl go into
this contest seeking their first win,
having sustained one tie and one
loss on last week’s trip.
l’eds Play Double Overtime Thriller

Fighting back from an 0-2 deficit
at halftime against Oswego last Sat-
ur..ay. the Pens played a double
oiertimc thriller but had to settle
tor a 2-2 tie. State‘s scores came in
4:47 of the tlilrd quarter. when
haoul Nunez countered for the Gar-
ciamcn and George Wood booted
through the posts at 10:50 of the
fourth quarter to knot the contest,
but that was the extent of State's
scoring.

Early in the first quarter. Bill
Dcvitt of Oswego. recently named
Athlete of the Month at that in-
stitution. sustained a broken leg,
and will be lost to them for the re-
mainder of the season. There was
some sad news for State also, as
Art Goldiii. a defensive mainstay of
the squad. suffered a recurrence of
ii knee injury and may be sidelined
for today‘s tilt. In the event that he
is. Garcia will shift Strickland to
fullback. more Cannon to end and
play Billings and Joy at the other
halfback slots.

State 'l'oppled

On Friday State met defeat at the
hands of Brockport. 5—0. The oppos—
ing (icicin was airtight and the
Ports inexperience and over-anxious-
iiesx proved their undoing.

The squad his been hard at work
this week in order to correct errors
of last week's games. The drills in-
cludc kicking with both feet. and
developing a speedier offensive pat-
tern. Red McCormack and Tom
King have shown steady improve-
ment. and with the shaping up of
the halfbacks. the team is rapidly
rounding into shape.
