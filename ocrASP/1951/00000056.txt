The Westinghouse News in Pitts-

editorial on the West Point scandal
and cribbing in general. “What does
it help a student to have his work
done by someone else? Using some-
one else‘s brain is of no more bene-
fit than to ask somebody else to
exercise his muscles to make our's
strong."

Sleep seems to be a major topic
on college campuses. From The
Bona Venture comes this Italian
proverb: "If I sleep I sleep for
myself; if I work. I know not for
whom." The Caellian has a versical
ve.sion: “Late to bed and early to
rise. gi "es a girl circles under her
eyes."

These quips. concise and philo-
sophic. come from Notrc Dame's
Scholastic: “ink elephant—beast of
bourbon." An epitaph seen on a
New England tombstone: “Here lies
an atheist. all dressed up and no
place to go.”

College publications show an in-
creasing interest in world affairs.
The Kansan published this gem of
sarcasm. “The announcement that
Eva Peron was given a blood trans—
fusion amazed us. What will the
Argentine people think when they
hear that their leader‘s wife uses
blood in her veins just like every-
body else."

Advice from Central Michigan
Life states: "One good way to have
a clean mind is to change it occa-
sionally." Don't you agree?

A spectrometer is an instrument

There have been construction

State lacked an adequate machine
shop. so those at vicinity high
schools had to be used. The glass

cost about 1500 dollars) had to be
chiiul'feurcd up from Brooklyn. It
was worse than hauling a load of
TNT. Orchids to Bill Cluck, Jim

ingenuity in welding and carpen—

A spectrometer is a rare instru-

aLproximatc cost is 29.400 dollars.
In five years Ccncral Electric has
manufactured about twenty of
