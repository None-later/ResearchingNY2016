Posters, Booth

Dazzle Draper

Flashing colors! Catchy
phrases! Elaborate d e s i g n s!
Have you noticed the booth and
posters which flank the walls of
the lower peristyle? If the
grueling task of studying leaves
you a. few minutes to spare, why
not take a. peek at the Soc Hop
booth?

It's a huge cardboard sock
painted with orange and green
stripes. Dangling ears of corn,
and hay make Lower Draper
really rural.

Authentic feather quills aml
musical notes point out the
poster-making ingenuity of the
frosh. Puns on names, too. re-
sult in greater publicity punch.
Symbols such as fire produce
startling effects. which are won-
derful aids in waking up
8:10’ers..

A new way to increase their All
University Fund has been found by
Nebraska University. Mock trials
are held for various student mis-
demeanors, and the fines go into the
fund. To date. students have been
charged for throwing football games,
embezzling club funds, and spiking
the tea at a chancellor's reception.

 

From the Denver Clarion comes
this versical plea:

“Now I lay me down to sleep.

The lecture’s dry, the subject deep,
If he should quit before I awake,
Give me a poke for goodness sake.”

A professor at Texas A. and M.
states that cribbing should be an
art. Quote: “the holding of hands
over one’s eyes while sneaking a
look at another paper is too obvious
and in reality crude. Coughs and
laying the head on the desk are
also give-aways.” However ,he does-
n't offer any constructive advice on
how to do it without getting caught.

The University of Kansas had to
move the statue of President Tru-
man. It had been painted three
times and whitewashed once.

A poetical tale of woe comes from
the University of New Mexico.

Writes one student:

“He asked me: ‘When?’

I could not tell.

He queried ‘Who?‘

Again I fell.

He named a man,

To me a stranger.

And I could see

Myself in danger.

What was this plight—this mystery?
Oh! Just my course in history."

Oxford To Award
Rhodes Scholarships

Animal competition for Rhodes
Scholarships will be held in all
states during December. Those
elected to receive the scholarships
will enter Oxford University in Oc-
tober. 1952.

An election to a Rhodes Scholar-
ship provides for two years of study
with a possible third. To be eligible,
an applicant must be a male citizen
of the United States, eighteen to
twenty-five years of age on October
1, 1952. have completed at least his
Sophomore year of college. and re-
ceive ofﬁcial endorsement from his
college or university.

Applications must be in the hands
of the state committee not later
than Saturday. November 3. Inter-
ested students are asked to contact
Dr. Shields McIlwainc, Professor of

English and Institutional Repre—
sentative, for additional informa-

tion. application blanks. and a
Memorandum of Regulations.

State Electorate State Graduates

Considers Bills

New York State voters will pass
or reject two proposed amendments,
numbers three and SIX, 'luesday,
November 6. Amendment three con-
cerns pensions for retired teachers;
amendment six concerns the fiscal
independence of city school boargis.

Amendment three, known as too
Mahoney bill, would give the Leg-
islature the power to supplement
the low pensions of retired teachers.
Seine retired teachers accumulated
their retirement credit when they
were receiving small salaries; sup-
porters of the bill believe that these
teachers pensions are not sufﬁcient
to meet today’s high cost of living.
Amendment three would enable the
Legislature to supplement their
penSions with money from the
State’s general fund.

Amendment six would give city
school districts debt limits entirely
separate from municipal debt lim—
its. Present legislation provides that
school boards in cities under 125,000
population are responsible for the
maintenance and operation 01'
schools. If Amendment six is pass-
ed, legislation to allocate existing
debt will become effective.

A Victory At Last . .

Varsity Boaters Journey To Plattsburg Tomorrow

Tomorrow the State College Soc-
cer team will embark on its second
road trip of the season in quest of
their second straight victory as they
journey to Plattsburg. Plattsburg
State Teachers, the only club on the
slate to be encountered in a home
and home series, suffered two losses
to the Statesman last year, by the
scores of 5-1 and 7-2. If the Feds
can bring home a victory in this tilt.
the over-all season recorci will be
brought tip to the .500 mark. with
one tie.

I'cds Win First

On Tuesday at Brverwyck Park.
State trounced Champlain 4-1 for
their initial victory of the season.
This encountcr was to have been
played at Champlain earlier in the
season but was delayed because of
unforeseen difficulties at the visit-
or's institution.

After a very strong first quarter,
in which State compiled a 2-0 ad-
vantage. both the defensive and
offensive pattern seemed to come
apart and had there been a strong-
er bld by the opposition. the final
cut. 1.1110 might very well have been
reversed. However. after two periods
of laxity on the part of the Peds,
they seemed to be rejuvenated and
finished strong with a superlative
fourth quarter.

(loldiii. Adams Star 0n Defense

A few statesmen managed to
maintain a conscious outlook
throughout the entire game, and
stellar performances were turned in
by Ralph Adams at Fullback. who
time and again thwarted scoring
bids by Champlain. Goldiii. also at
Fullback, is rapidly cementing him-
self as a defensive mainstay.

Henry Hull. moved up from the
JV to the Varsity. also proved his
inettl-e on the forward line by set-
ting up numerous scoring opportu-
nitles and coupled with Bill Me-
L‘ormick‘s fine play contributed
greatly to the offensive pattern.
Raoul Nunez has apparently over-
come his early season injury and
displayed hustle and commendable
gentralship. contributing two goals
to the State cause. Tom King and
McCormick accounted for the other
markers.

.Ir. Varsity Wins

On Saturday the JV. under the
guiding hand of Coach Dave Weath-
erby. avenged an early season loss
by subduing RPI‘s JayVees. 3-2, in a
double overtime. This victory can
be accredited to the diligence of

Coach Weatherby and the hard
work of his cohorts. Many of
these men have never played soccer
before, and have been drilling on
fundamentals day after day. and
the results have been highly suc—
cessful. Bill Adams Scored two of
the State goals and Hank Hull
countered the third and decisive
tally. This victory balances the
books for the Junior Peds at one
and one. It would be impossible to
single out any individual star, since
the entire team performed as a well
coordinated unit.

The JV's travel to West Lebanon.
Mass, on Tuesday. to play Darrow
Academy. The Prep school boys
have a very splendid record and
should provide ample competition
for Weatherby's boys.

Syracuse Wallops State
The Feds got a lesson in defensive

soccer last Friday as they were lam-
basted by the Orange of Syracuse
6-0. The visitors presented a very
potent brother combination in the
abilities of "Ziggi‘e" and Gunnar
Worth. The former, an All-Ameri-
can 1ast year. tallied twice, while
his younger brother came through
with the "hat trick” for the victors.
The Case fullbacks and goalie didn’t
give the State kickers a chance as
their charm-like operations halted
‘the best that the home club could
muster.

Garcia will start Pete Telfer in
the goal in tomorrow’s encounter
and will deploy the following men
up field. Ralph Adams, Art Goidin,
Al Cannon, Dean Strickland. Phil
Billings, Hank Hull, Tom King.
Raoul Nunez, Jerry Meyer, or George
Wood, and “Red” McCormick.

Clash To Feature
Opposite Styles

This afternoon on Dorm Field. the
1951 Intraiiiui'al Football League
comes to a close as Potter (,iub
takes on the Indians for the chain-
pionship. The Indians, an unscored
upon ball Club this season, promise
to give the high powered Potter of-
iensn'e a real test.

Potter has averaged three TD's
per game in four encounters and
nus been scored upon just once dur-
1113' regular season play. The tenta-
tive line—up Will include such stellar
performers as Ray "Tennessee"
Chainplm, Mike La Manna, and Pat
Carlo in the backfield. with Harry
Johnson. Joe Persico. and Herb Eg-
crt bringing Up the forward wall.
Fil'.ng out the starting nine will be
Paul Ward. Dick Eckstrom and Tom
Singleton. Coached by Paul Carter,
the offensive promises to be in full
swing. despite the loss of Tom Yale
and Don Burns. who will miss the
tussle because of injuries and con-
ferences. respectively.

Indians Stress Defense

fl he Indians. captained by George
Schaci'tl. base their claim to fame
on good kicking and an iron wall
that has yielded but four first downs
and no ponits all season. Featuring
an offensive that has scored four
safeties and four touchdowns all
season. the Indians still managed to
win three games and tie one this
year.

chci'al men on the roster have
been forced to play offense and de-
fense with no relief but luckily no
one was hurt, and they will be at
full strength for today‘s tilt. The
starting. line-up shapes up with
Pctc Button and “Flash” Fox at the
ends. Hank Feuei'bach and Henry
Bt‘.'liil1 ill guirds. and John "Tiger"
Stevenson at center. The backfield
has Schaci'tl. Paul Victor, Jack
Young and Dick Star‘ford with Ken
Stevenson and Sven Sloth filling
in on defense.

'l‘ig'lii (lar'; Expected

The qucstion to be settled is, can
1h.» Indians withstand the pressure
of a wrll co-oi'dinatcd offense as
they have the offenses they have
met so far? Having done that; would
Illi'y be able to score? It looks like
a 1.00.1 game. so be at Dorm Field
at 4:30 this afternoon to see the
game of the year.
