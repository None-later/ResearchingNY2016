14¢ I See It

By DON BURNS

 

If those two “wondering” person-
alities who edit a rather impish col-
umn in this sparsely read tabloid
had bothered to look beyond their
noses they could have filled their
"hash" last week with something
more constructive than a take off
on the publicity of athletics.

In the first place the downtown
boys have been plagued by members
of this sports staff with data and
ncws about our various activities.
Abe Blattman '53. has kept up steady
contacts with both the local papers
and it’s not his. or our fault that
they fall to rtspond cooperatively.

Under the guidance of Julie Korba
'53, a new Sports Press Release Bu-
reau has been set up to handle sports
contacts with hometown papers.
competing codeges. and local outlets.
The Class of ‘55 has contributed
much to this new and important
function through the efforts of Tom
Hague. Bob Ingles. Walt Lawder,
and Bob Ashfield. The new office
has already inacie its initial contacts
and is ready to send a steadier flow
of information to the points where
it will do the most good.

Another point for our two noted
“crusaders.” you publicize an ath-
lctlc event . . . you never adver-
tise! Arcn't sports commercialized
enough without casting their lot in
the same boat as a bar of soap or a
bottle of beer?

The deserved jibe of the “dig”
thrown towards the sports publicity
lies directly within the MAA. They
have a Publicity Director and a
Manager of Athletics who should be
on the ball in relation to making
the Home Dates known on campus:
come. come. boys.

As for predictions. I could take
a whirl at predicting when the IM
pigskin championship will be playcd.
If I did. George would be sure to
change it. just like Kazmaicr did to
the Cornell game last week!

How About That!
Pigskin Champ
To Be Decided

This Friday. regardless of rain.
snow. sleet or a cyclone, Potter Club
will meet the Indians for the Intra-
mural Football Championship. Ac-
cording to League Manager George
Schaertl. the rained out, postponed.
rescheduled contest will definitely
be played Friday afternoon at 3:40
on Dorm Field.

The two foes will line up as fol-
lows:

I’ottcr Club Indians
Burns E Fox
Ward G Berleth
Egcrt (‘ J. Stevenson
Singleton G K. Stevenson
Johnson E Button
Eckstrom GB Stanford
Lamanna RH Feuerbach
Champlin LH Victor
Carter FB Schaertl

I’ottcr Subs: J. Persico. Sonbei'g.
Carlo. Gibb. Lewis. Jacobson. Fay.

Indian Subs: D. Pcrsico. Young.

Sloth,

Refcrccs: Wiley. Kachn. Goodall,

The Indians have lost several
men originally on the roster because
of the new ruling which prohibits
basketball players from playing ill-
iramural football. Potter. with the
exception of Tom Yole. who frac-
tured two ribs in his last game, will
be at full strength.

As we stressed last wcck. the tus-
slc promises to feature a battle be-
tween thc Potter offense and the
liidiaii dci‘cusc. Whatever the out-
come. the fray shapes up as being
the best of the year.

We're sure the long-awaited game
will be a good one. so see you this
afternoon at Dorm Field.

Streak Ends At Two

Cannon, Adams
Defensive Stars

At West Point

On Wednesday. the statesmen
traveled to West Point for their
fourth road game out of six played
thus far this season and succumbed
to a powerful onslaught at the hands
of the Black Knights JV by the
score of 3-0.

Hindered greatly by the loss of
Raoul Nunez. the team’s leading
scorer and playmaker. due to a
throat condition. the State forward
wall seemed unable to set a consis-
tent offensive pattern. and coupled
with Army's superlative wall of de-
fense netted a goose-egg for the
Purple and Gold.

Teifer Slips . . . Army Scores

The initial Army goal came late
in the first quarter. when Pete Tel-
fer lost his footing on the mud in
what would have been an ordinary
save for him. The score was booted
across by Karns at 13:30. For the
second quarter the Feds more than
held their own. and turned in their
best showing of the game with the
half ending with Albany on the
short end of a 1-0 count. In the
third and fourth quarters State's
passing was way below par and in
spite of excellent defensive play on
the parts of Ralph Adams, Al Can-
non. and Dean Strickland. the ofu
fensive didn't materialize. This loss
brings the Booters' record to a
2-3-1 count for the season.

On Wednesday the Garciamen
will entertain a powerful Union
College aggregation on Beverwyck
Field at 2:30. This will mark the
first official encounter for the Feds
against another Capital District
college for this season. and should
prove interesting.

JV Loses 2-0

Last Tuesday the JV journeyed
to Massachusetts to take on the
Darrell Prep School. Playing on a
small. rough. unfamiliar field. the
boys were out-done 2-0. Darrell
scored a goal in each of the first
two 10-minute quarters and then
held on to win despite several deter-
mined scoring threats by State.

The Darrell outfit was a very
well-coordinated and extremely ag-
gr'esslve bunch of kids. State played
well but was unable to get the extra
punch required to score.

For State College. Danny Joy
played especially well at center for-
ward. Really hustling. Dan gave a
good account of himself as he strived
desperately to lead his team to vic-
tor'y: however it was not to be, and
so their current record stands at
1 and 1.

State Beats Plattsburgh

On Saturday the soccer team paid
a visit to Plattsburg arid trounced
their hosts 4-2. Raoul Nunez scored
two goals for State and Red McCor'~
mick and Tom King each tallied
once. Strangely enough. these were
the some men who scored in the
last encounter with Plirttsburg. A
bit of excitement occurred when Ben
Button. ordinarily one of the mildcst
men on the soccer team. was ejected
from tiic playing field for exhibiting
his anger at a Plattsburg player
who was also removed from the
contest. It was a good trip and the
wholc team played well to bring
homc the victory. their second of
the season.
