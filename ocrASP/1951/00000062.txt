In the fall of 1948 a "Grad Ice-
breaker" was held to introduce the
grad students to their faculty and
to each other. At later meetings that
year the State College Association
for Graduates was formed. The
association is open to faculty inter
ested in working with the grads.

Every June SCAGS dissolves and
most of the members don't return
to State. In September SCAGS is
floundering without support, and a
steering committee must set the .or-
ganization aﬂoat again. Three mem-
bers of the committee are chosen
the preceding spring from the Sen—
ior class, and in the fall these three
choose .three more members. The
committee publicizes SCAGS and
now is holding election of officers.

Each candidate for ofﬁce must
place a petition signed by 15 grads
in the nomination box in Rgom 2.
Richardson before 4:30 p.m. Friday.
November 9. Personal information
including the college where under-
graduate work was done. previous
activities and ofﬁces. and residence
must be attached to each petition.

Merlin [he Weatherman
Puts Curse On Dorm

(‘oiscs. foich again! It‘s all
the fault of" villainous Merlin
tho Weatherman who has put
a curse on the castle, former
Brubachcr Hall. A deep moat
surrounds the fortress. making
it impenetrable to the outside
world.

Isolated victims eagerly await
the arrival of their knights
dashing up on white chargch
or plowing through mud in hip
boots. If the knight l'ccls prop-
trly dramatic. he can glidc by
in his gondola.

Shut-ins long for the Eliza—
bethan crzi when gentlemen with
long cloaks wcrc quite the rage.
(in cincrging from their castle.
anxiously they gaze up and down
the moat. But alas! When a
modcrn Sir Walter Raleigh ap—
pcurs. it‘s to no avail. A wind-
brcukcr can never do the trick.

What's il \vciithcrmiin's curse
to us modcrns‘.’ The ancients
spanncd thc sczis; wc can cross
it moat!
