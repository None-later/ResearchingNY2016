By DORIS DOHEBTY

 

How about making WAA awards
an honor, bestowed upon those
whose interest lies in sports and
sportsmanship. by weeding out those
who seek only the glory of receiv-
ing an award? Shouldn't a letter or
any other award be conferred as
an honor and reward for participa-
tion, rather than as a badge de-
si .natin; a minimum of 40 hours of
p.ay in four sports.

Under the present WAA set-up.
any girl can earn an award by mere-
Iy participating for award credit
and in a variety of sports ranging
from twirling or hiking to field
hockey. In field hockey, for instance,
under the present system, credit
could be earned in about two weeks'
time. by playing for two hours on
five afternoons. However. those
truly interested in the sport aver—
age. a major fraction of the possible
thirty hours of play so for this year.
Slioultl both girls get the same dc.—
grco of athletic recognition?

Under the old system credit was
cii'rn only for participating for two-
ihirds the possible hours in a par-
ticular sport. Then. only those truly
interrsted earned athletic awards
because there was no easy way.

Obviously when credit is being
tiycn izndcr the two-thirds system.
those interested in only the award
will tuzn to sports like swimming,
hiking and riding which are judged
on the hourly basis. Therefore. to
equalize award requirements. how
about further lillliLillg rcquircincnts
by designating that ihrcc of the
four sports credits bc earned in
WAA >ll])L‘l‘\'iSCfl play or athletic
clubs. with the othcr quarter credit
to hc paint-d in any other accredited
activity.

At present WAA Council is con—
sidering a change back to the two-
tliii'Js system. Let them know how
you fool.

State Bowlers
Bow To Alumni

The State Varsity bowlers are suf—
fering a bad slump as they lost to
thc Staie Alumni in a very closely
contested match. The Alumni tilted
the maples for a 2359 against a
2332 rolled up by the losers. The
Gl'.i(iS took two of the three games.

Carmen Corsi‘s triple of 518 and
the 39—pin handicap spotted still
wasn‘t sufficient enough for the
’l‘cnchi-rs to eke out a victory.

’ihc State Alumni is a powerful
the which may bounce back to give
the other tennis in the league a
good struggle for first place after
siiirtiii; off the season very poorly.
’Ihc lcading men on this promising
fivc arc Don Burt and Paul Carter.

Burt Leads League

Aftcr last week's triple 01' 519.
Burt now becomes the top man in
individual scoring for the Inter-
collegiate Bowling League with an
average of 176. He is followed by two
Stat." College bowlers, Carmen Corsi
and "Red McCormick.

'f‘lic Stair Varsity kcglcrs are still
in sccond place behind Albany Phar-
nia 'y with the Alumni in third place.

Prolong Season

State's booters have an excellent
chance of pulling their season’s
won-lost record up to .500 as they
play host to Plattsburg tomorrow.
at 2:30 at Beverwyck. Plattsburg.
the only team on State's schedule
that is met on a home and home
basis was beaten by the Garciamen
up in the North Country earlier this
season. ‘i‘nis contest was originally
to have sounded the final Wnis‘tie
lor the Varsity Soccer team's ac-
tivities for tile year, but one to a
postponement. the season Will be
1.1'Uluiigdtl until Nov-ember 19. Satur-
day will be the fuse time in ten
oays that the men will see action
and coupled with inCiement weather
it Will lliluOUDLEGly take a little lus-
ter iioin their attaca. Mia-Seins
have cut into the attendance and
iurther adds to the woes of Joe
Care-1.x. however, his boys have
been working on fundamental Skills,
and should make a worthy showing.

Cannon Moved To CF

ror this contest Joe has made a
few changes. which include moving
Al Cannon to the all—important
Lciiter-rorward slot. This maneu-
vcr will be Al‘s first crack at this
post and if he continues his spark
and bustle. they team should re-
ceive a Li‘ClllCllClOIlS lift.

Another important switch will see
pcppy Joe Siciia starting his first
varsity game of the season at the
spot vacated by Cannon, Right Half
hack. Cannon should add to State’s
oilcnsivc pattern and Stella, a fast
learning newcomer. will bolster the
already adequate defense. Mean-
while. tile Pcd mainstays, Ralph
Adams. Curly Strickland. and Red
McCormick will combine their ef-
forts to bring home their third vic~
tory.

llnion Game To Be Played Nov. 19

On Wednesday, the team was to
have engaged Union College. how—
ever. the field was a mass of mud,
snow, and mire with no possibility
of staging a game. The contest with
the Dutchmen will be held Novem—
ber 19. and will be the finale for
Garcia‘s second season.

The starting line up for the next
two games will include the follow-
ing: Goalie. Pete Telfcr; RFB.
