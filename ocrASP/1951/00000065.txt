Survey On Younger Generation
"Le Roi Marie” Finds Youth Grave, Conservative

Grave. fatalistic, conservative, si-
1ent. security-minded, gregarious,
and tolerant of almost anything.
Do these adjectives describe your
friends, or even yourself? They
should, because Time, in a recent
analysis of America's youth (ages 18
to 28) reported these to be their
basic traits.

In a nationwide survey. teachers,
guardians. and the younger gener'
ation were observed and questioned.
Results indicate that the grave,

Select Board Member
Oi Residence Council

Residence Council has elected one
of its members to act as the sixth
member of Judicial Board, according
to Miriam Carter '52. President. This
new member is Anna Apostolides ’52.
President of Pierce Hall.

Judicial Board is a sub-division of
the Council. The Board deals with
the infractions of Residence Regu-
lations. except those for which au-
tomatic penalty is imposed. accord-
ing to Miss Carter.

fatalistic attitudes stem from the
world situation, specifically the
“Korean Business.” Conservatism is
in direct contrast to actions of for-
mer generations who wanted to
shock their elders.

Along with conservatism goes a
silence, which the article terms
"the most startling fact about the
.'ounger generation." Professors
‘cannot get a rise out of the docile
note-takers in their classes.” These
traits seem to apply to the interior
as well as the exterior: “intellectual-
ly. today‘s young people already
seem a bit stogy."

Young people’s ambitions are lim—
ited to finding a “good, safe job."
preferably with a big firm. Young
women, a serious problem to the
generation. want both a career and
marriage. Many feel that just a
home and children would be “a fate
worse than death."

Although general concensus of
opinion terms youth individualistic.
in reality it isn’t. Outside a group,
young people are unhappy.

This is a brief picture of our gen-
eration, the “oldest young gener-
ation in the world."
