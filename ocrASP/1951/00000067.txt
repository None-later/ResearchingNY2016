’44 I See I; Beavers And EEP

By DON BURNS

 

This is the time of year when the
sportswriters throughout the coun-
try begin picking their All-Ameri-
can, All Conference, etc. teams; so,
not to be outdone I will join the
misinformed masses and put forth
my nominations for the Ali-1M
football team. Sticking closer to the
form, I am naming both an offen-
sive and defensive team and
think all those named deserve the
recognition for their fine play
throughout the season.

Offense:

End H. Johnson Potter
Tackle J. Stephenson Indians
Center H. Egert Potter
Tackle ’I‘. Singleton Potter
End T. Murray Angels
Back J. Morrisscy Commuters
Back B. Wiley, KDR
Back R. Champlin Potter
Back G. Schaertl Indians
Defense:

End M. Frank KB
Tackle E. Holt Vagabonds
Center K. Ludlum Grads
Tackle .I. Perisco Potter
End R. ﬂilsinger SLS
Back A. Blattman KB
Back T. Zowine Angels
Back P. Carlo Potter
Back A. Brown KDR
These men could have formed
the nucleus of a good Varsity foot-
ball team here at State. Seems as
though the money angle is holding
us back . . . then again if the stu-
dent body can raise over a thous-
and bucks for charity, why can't
they do the same for themselves!
It's said that "charity begins at

home."

Joe Garcia has his hands full of
work again; that's nothing new for
the diminutive wondcrboy as he
takes up the coaching duties for
the Varsity Wrestling Team and JV
Basketball. Joe expects a good turn-
out for the mat aggregation and
hopes to duplicate last year's unde-
feated record. His load could be too
much for some people . . . perhaps
even Joe, who just concluded a rig-
orous soccer schedule. Wonder if
the curtailed .JV Basketball Sched-
ule could be handled by a couple of
student coaches and leave Coach
Garcia's full time abilities to the
grunt and groaners?

The ping-pong aspirants can view
the finals next week as Text Strauss
defends his title for the third year
in a row against Al Brown '53.

Poiier Takes Title,

In a hard played game that fea-
tured rough defensive play and loose

Taking 3 points from Potter Club,
the Beavers moved into the first
division of the Bowling League. Pot-
ter traded places with the Beavers
by dropping to third. Fine games by
Leviness, Warrell. Clark and Dem-
crs led to the victory as Frank Fay
and Tom Beninatl bowled good
games for the losers. The Potter
Grads. of course. remained in first
place as they drew a bye for the
week‘s play.

Kappa Beta maintained their hold
on fourth place as they took 4
points on a forfeit from the Rum-

Dums. Neil Ryder and Marty Frank A

rolled games of 194 and 189 respec-
tively before the forfeit was de-
clared official. Bert Jablon and Tom
King showed for the Rumdums.

to the .500 mark as they took 3
roints from KDR. Led by Gordie
Bennett who averaged 187‘;- pins

Doug Thornc.

In the lower division the Misfits
clung to n slender lead as the Cain-
mutcrs and Finks moved tip to a
second place tie. The Splits and
K-Bobblcs traded positions with
each other and the Rousers and
"F0 4 plus 1" brin'iing up the rear.

Forfeiting the first game. the
Finks came back to take three
points from the Rouscrs. Krchniak
and Lanni bowled well for the
Finks while Ccrwonkii and Berlcth
led the not-so-rousing Roiiscrs. Thc
Commuters swept 4 points from the
K Bobblcs with Kii'ch and Ever-
Iliil‘Cl showing the way in a low-
scoring contest.

Easy Victories In

At Willamantic

Tomorrow Nite

Tonight the State College Varsi-
ty oiiiciaily lifts the lid on the cur-
rent hoop campaign as they play
host to a well-seasoned Maritime
quintet. Maritime wnl iield Virtual-
ly the same big, hard-drivmg out-
lit as iasr year, WllICI‘I was sparked
by Van Wort and Nelson, and has
been bolstered by the addition of
Rosmussen. an All New York City
nigh School star.

Maritime should prove to be one
of the Peds' toughest opponents on
the slate, smce they have war
games already under their belt, and
have sustained only one loss. by 15
points to N.Y.U.

'loinorrow night the squad will
play their initial road contest
against Willamantic in New hav-
en. Not too mucn can be said about
the Willie's who are as yet an un-
known quantity.

Varsity Swamps Alumni

On the Monday before vacation
the Varsity slaughtered the Alumni

test was in doubt was at the open-
ing wnistle. When the score was
tied, and at the end of the first
stanza, when the count stood 14-12.
Varsity.

In the second quarter, sparked by
Art Weigand and Bob Brown, the
statesmen jumped ahead to a 10
point lead, and increased this mar-
gin progressively, until fortunately
the clock ran out.

Coach hatnaway used many com-
binations. but the Varsity, never
seriously challenged, was guilty of
easmg up at times, and then, in
trying to make up for this, being
over anxious, thereby turning in an
erratic performance.

McDonald and Prout Shine

One of the brightest spots in the
teams showing was the line play-
making and bustle exhibited by lit-
tle (Jerry McDonald, a freshman.
who managed to maintain his poise
throughout the game and almost
monotonously set up scoring
chances for his teammates. Anoth-
er newcomer, Bud Prout '53. a
transfer, turned in a commendable
evenings work, displaying hustle
and drive.

The lineup for tonight‘s game:
forwards, Walker and Brown; cen-
ter, Taber; and guards. Zongrone
