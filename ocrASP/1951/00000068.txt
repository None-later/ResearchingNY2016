be tabled for one week. If the rule
is waived, a special meetin j of stu-
dent Association will be scheduled
for-Wednesday noon.

The proposed budget involves $698
which the Board requests to pay ex-
penses of the Union Dances. a con-
ference, and administration.

Student Council also approved a
RadioCouncll request for money to
purchase a tape recorder. This re-
questwill be brought before Student
Association in the near future.

According to Joan Bennett '52,
Chairman of the Social Calendar
Committee, organizations which
have signed for dates on the tenta-
tive social calendar must file reser-
vation cards in the office of the
Dean of Women before Wednesday.
If these cards are not filed, the dates
will- be removed from the calendar.
A meeting of organization heads
will be held during the first week
of second semester to arrange the
social calendar for the semester.

As some punster once said, “Time
goes in one year and out the other."
The time has almost come for it to
go out, leaving us with the frighten-
ing discovery that there are only 21
more shopping days till Christmas
(counting today, that is).

Since time grows short (only 15'?
shopping hours left) and finances
are naturally limited, we have corn-
plled a set of simple shopping sug-
gestions. Use them with discretion.

Parents are always a problem.

WAA Delegates
Four To Conference

Four State women will attend a
conference of the State Women’s
Athletic Association to be held this
weekend at Barnard College, Joan
Haggerty ’52, President of Women's
Athletic Association Council, has
announced. Official delegates to the
conference are Sally McCain and
Anna Apostolides. Seniors, while
Marilyn Burke ’53 and Audrey
Burke ’54 will attend the meeting as
unofficial delegates.

 

Thus it is with considerable thought
that we make this gift suggestion.
Get a blank check, make it out to
yourself, fill in the dollar blank
with a nominal fee, and leave the
signature blank, blank. And there it
is; one present problem solved.

For girl fiiends, here's a token
that's bound to please. All it takes
is the giving. the giving of your
fraternity pin. But if you feel like
spending a little cash, we have in-
side iniormation that Woolworth’s
is having a terrific sale on diamonds.

The ideal gift for men costs only
three cents. write a pleading letter
to Harry and beg for a higher num-
ber in your giftee's draft status.
Make the men enjoy receiving their
“Greetings.”

Presents to babies can instruct as
well as delight. Have you notes
from former courses Just lying
around gathering dust? Why not let
your baby friends absorb culture
while they amuse themselves with
the crackling noises your paper
knowledge gives them?

Give your presents a touch of
individuality. Be ingenious and save
valuable time and money.

D & A Group

To Experiment
in Play Reading

The Dramatics and Arts affiliates
will present a reading of Ibsen’s
"The Wild Duck" Monday evening
at 8 p.lll. The readings will be held
in the new Draper auditorium, ac-
cording to Henry Smith ’52, Presi—
dent of D&A.

Those composing the cast in this
afﬁliate presentation are George
Stephens, Grad; Henry Smith,
Thomas Holman, and Roslyn Lacks,
Seniors; Richard Scott, Veronica
Pricc, James Hughes, Louis Vion,
and Thomas Hughes. Juniors. With-
out the beneﬁt of sets, costumes,
stage movements, or any other cus-
tomary stage adornincnts, the read-
ers will render interpretations of
their lines solely by the use of cer-
tain inflcctional and expressive
qualities of their voices, Smith
states.

This type of dramatic presentation
is new to D & A afﬁliate players.
However. because of the success of
similar readings in New York City
this season, done by the First Drama
Quartet. G. B. Shaw's “Don Juan
in Hell" from “Man and Superman,“
D. & A has attempted this more
difﬁcult but stimulating type 0‘
dramatic presentation, states Smith

Smith invites all students to the
presentation. There will be no ad-
mission charge.
