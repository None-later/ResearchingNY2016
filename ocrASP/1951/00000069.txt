the costume was a light blue peas-
ant dress.

For the Mirror Aria, “Dis moi qc'
je suis belle," from "Thais," Miss
Jepson chose a gown of pink and
white decorated with sequins. With
this gown she wore a flowing green
velvet robe. Another famous aria
which she sang is "Adieu Notre Pe-
tite Table" from “Manon.” The
sheer white gown worn for this lat—
ter scene had a red polka dotted
tiered skirt, and it, as all the cos-
tumes did, helped Miss Jepson to
better portray the character.

With her accompanist playing the
music from the opera, Miss Jepson
told the story in its simplest form
and interpreted the soprano arias.
She chose the operas presented be-
cause of the distinctly different.
heroine in each.

Through her great talent Thais.
Marguerite, and Manon stood upon
the stage of Page Hall. For encores
Miss Jepson sang a Vienesc
waltz. "Sweetest Little Fellow," and
“I‘ll Follow My Secret Heart."
