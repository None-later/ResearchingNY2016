It seems that when Ezra Pound,
the poet. went to Hamilton he be-
came a little bored ﬁlling out the
usual registration data. For variety
(the spice, you know) he wrote:

“Occupation: Lunatic

Nature of Business: Mixed

Your Position: Not bad

Name of Organization with Which

You are Associated: The re-
mains of civilization

Previous Occupations: Opponent

of usuriocracy and enemy to
criminal destroyers of the U. S.
Constitution including presidents
and other highly placed swine."

This deﬁnition of a girl's life cy-
cle comes from Muhlenberg College
in Allentown. “Safety pins, bobby
pins, fraternity pins, clothes pins.
rolling pins, safety pins.“

Notre Dame seems to have poetry
011 the brain. Here are two sample
quatrains.

“He only drinks to calm himself.

His steadiness to improve.

Last night he got so steady,

He couldn’t even move.“

“The saddest words of tongue and
pen

May be, perhaps, ‘It might have
been.‘

 

The sweetest words we know by
heck,

Are only these, ‘Enclosed ﬁnd

check’.”

The Daily Kansan has made a
philosophical discovery: “There is
nothing wrong with basketball that
can’t be fixed."

A columnist for the Ddtly Penn-
sylvanian made a cigarette survey
recently. He discovered that “most
doctors don't even smoke, there is
no T-zone, certain cigarettes are
not ﬁrm and fully packed, and a
longer cigarette is a nuisance to
handle (anyone not used to one tries
to light it in the middlel.”

Potsdam-ites have issued a dis-
sertation on the kiss, before and
after education. Isn't ignorance
bliss?

“Before I heard the doctors tell

The dangers of a kiss,

I had considered kissing you

The nearest thing to bliss.

But now I know Biology

And sit and sigh and moan:

Ten million mad bacteria

And I thought we were alone."

Massachusetts Tech
