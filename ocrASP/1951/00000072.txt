What’s The Purpose?

When one-tenth of the faculty of State College
attends the one night of the year reserved on the
College Calendar for All-State Night, it is time for

tndent Council to re-examine the basic principle
or which this occasion is held. This year the date
for All-State night was changed on the calendar
upon request of several faculty members, yet the
attendance of the faculty at the Tuesday event was
not sufficient to warrant a repeat performance in
the future.

If All-State night is for the purpose of improv-
ing the student-faculty relations of the college a
program should be offered which will fulfill _the
purpose in the easiest way. Certainly suffiCient
receptions are held at the beginning of the year,
faculty teas are on the calendar in order to en-
able students and faculty to become acquainted.
However, if the two groups prefer events which
are much less formal, student-faculty nights should
serve the purpose. It cannot serve the purpose if
the faculty does not attend. Perhaps for the im-
provement of this program, a student-faculty com—
mittee should be set up to plan the event in or;
der that both the student body and the faculty
may support the affair.

What's The Policy?

With budgets of organizations now under con-
sideration and after the discussion of the Student
Union Board budget in assembly last Friday, the
questions have arisen as to what is the purpose
of the Student Board of Finance and what policy
the Board is following?

One of the main purposes of the Student Board
of Finance, as outlined in the SA Constitution, is
“to investigate and act upon requests for extra
funds from surplus.” Certainly every member in
SA does not know the overall point of view of the
budget. Student Board of Finance should compare
the lines of one budget to another; SA is not in
position to have the available material.

This does not mean that the members of the
Student Board of Finance should have a nega-
tive attitude toward granting money to organiza-
tions. it would be of more value if the members
of the Board. when money is requested from sur-
plus, send recommendations to the student as-
sembly. If money has been requested by an or-
ganization, it is not of worth to know that the
organization wants money . . . the important fact
is what the amount in the surplus is and what
the Student Board of Finance has recommended
in respect to this request. In this way every indi-
vidual in the student assembly can weigh the opin—
ions of the organizations and the Board and de-
cide if the money should or should not be grant-
ed.

Otherwise, what should be the purpose of the
Student Board of Finance, if not to make decis-
ions upon the requests from surplus and budgets
as they are being presented? Organizations could
take their budgets directly to the Student Couri-
cil and have the entire assembly carry on a dis-
cussion. The Student Board of Finance should
go over the budgets carefully this year; every line
should be justified in order to conserve the assem-
bly time when the budgets come up and to keep
the student tax at a minimum.

It has been over a year since I
have enjoyed the hospitalitv of this
column. During that time my inter-
est has suffered a narrowing from
the heroics of a draft-age student
and has come home to a more fa-
miliar country. After all. there isn't
much I can do about the draft. but
there are a couple of things here
at State which I would like to talk
about.

The democratic system of educa-
tion is planned to give every student
an equal opportunity. and it has de-
veloped satisfactorily from the ri-
gidity of the Latin grammar school
through the license of the academy
to the well-organized curriculum of
our present secondary school. Mod-
ern educators are very eager to ex-
ploit the efﬁciency of public school
organization in a praiseworthy ef-
fort to secure the blessings of liter-
acy for each young American. but it
is an indictment against us that
primary Latin is now offered at the
college level. an indication that the
courses in secondary school which
are primarily thought material are
losing their grip on the popular im-
agination. I shouldn't be surprised
to learn that foreign languages and
higher mathematics are being drop-
ped from schools to satisfy the edit-

What do girls look for in boys?
The University of Kansas conducted
a. poll and received these answers.
“Gee. I guess I look for those bfpad
shoulders—3’ "I look for their more
personal qualities like a car. money,
etc." “One. has he got a car? Two.
a fellow that treats me like a lady—.
Three. two big arms."

Students at the University oi
Toronto have decided that coeds do
not make good dates, after holding
a debate intended to “strip off all
pretenses and lay bare the naked
truth." The one female present
could not fight back. “You see," she
said. “I have never had a date with
a coed."

The Minnesota Daily commented
on this article in the Minneapolis
Star: “She also complained that
Prince Wladyslaw Gerzy Buguslnw
Radziwil. her husband of 20 months.
brushed his teeth with hot water."
Said the Daily: "Well. why not? In
order to pronounce that name. you
have to lubricate your jaws sortie-
how."

An ironicni article in the Mont~
clarion discusses a new pcdigogicnl
book written by Dr. Pedagogy. PhD.
“He firmly states that children are
being born every day and his ro-
scurch proves that these Very chil-
dren have parents. Something must
be done to protect us. the teachers."

"We must realize once and for all
that we are teachers through slicer
necessity and must teach children.
7- biit this new menace (the rising
birth rate! has been steadily iii-
cri-nsing these past few years. With
our superior intellect We haw held
a large margin. but today We must
face the facts: they’re smarter than
We are."

cator's passion for a curriculum
which will satisfy everyone. This
would be against demorracy; a stu-
dent needs a program of study
which will stimulate him to highest
ability. and the present trend is
toward a common denominator in
the worst sense of the term. An ed-
ucation—to be an education—must
satisfy every need of the student.

Another knife to sharpen. Rela-
tions between Milne and State have
always been strained; there is a
mutual distrust between practice
teacher and student. There will al-
ways be the teacher who makes it
no secret that he is teaching be-
cause it is a required course. and
there will always be his companion.
the Milnite who likes to be fiendish.
Between these two are the majority
of Milne teachers and students who
suffer from the malcontents who
spread the Black Gospel. Milnites
aren’t perverse; they are just ado-
lescent, and the trouble comes when
the teacher makes no adjustment
to the student‘s notion of life. It
isn't well known that Milne and
State are one unit with one facul‘v
and administrative body. The more
enthusiastic members of Student
Association might remember this
when next they talk of school spirit
and cooperation. The initial respon-
sibility lies with State students, for
they stand to benefit most.

I hope the comparitively narrow
range of my interest has come up
with some valid points. It has been
enjoyable talking with you.

To the Editor:

It has been the crs‘om at State
for sometime past to close the
“Commons” during special assem-
blies. This action has the sole pur-
pose of forcing people into attend-
ing these sessions. which is as much
as to admit that they are not of
enough importance to merit an ap-
preciable audience on their own no-
count—hence the use of coercion.

On Sunday evening, December
ninth. the Student Union Snack Bar
was closed with sclfsumc intent as
that which forces the closing of the
"Commons." In this instance it was
to coerce people into attending a
group-smnsorcd function at the
school.

Do the people who bring these
events about think that the students
at this institution are a bunch of
sheep who have to he led here and
there. not knowing on their own
account where they want to "0 or
what they want to see? Enough of
this nonsense! If any organization
or group in this school desires an
audience. let it obtain that audience
from interested parties and not
through infringement upon the
privileges of others.

Yours truly,
lion Russell ’52

SAME OLD BULL!

At Student Council Wednesday night the student
Union Board . . .

presented the constitution for approval and suc-
ceeded in obtaining the fondest endearment of the
Student Council. One of the articles in the constitu-
tion calls for a S. U. Board of nine members. This
seems like a small number of people to plan and ex-
ecute Student Union activities when you consider D
and A Council has fifteen members. Music Council
has fourteen members and the State College News
has 13 members. If these latter organizations on cam-
pus need that many people to carry on the work after
many years of organization. it seems that the Student
Union Board should need more "heads" to carry on
its work especially when it‘s a beginning organi ation.

It mi‘ht be a good idea for all S.A. members to
look into this and other issues too numerous to ex-
plain in this column . . . your student government is
there. why don't you use it?

Also—where did the money for the last Student
Union Dance come from since that particular line
wasn't passed in the Student Assembly?

CO-OPERATION . . .

Many of the Greeks have taken the idea of help
week to heart and are planning Christmas sings, en-
tertainment and aid at the Clinton Square Neighbor-
hood House. Really a fine idea and many congrats!

MAYBE!?

The faculty is now having meetings discussmg our
curriculum. The questions under debate are: mini-
mizing language requirements. forgetting third and
fourth and taking electives instead. likewise with
frosh oral English if the incoming freshmen can pass
an oral exam and instituting degrees in specialized
math and science courses.

This idea would seem to go along with the 550
frosh for the next year deal. If this is so. thank good-
ness.

Actually the reason for a higher goal in registra-
tion is that the bulge in primary school will hit high
schools in four or ﬁve years—and of course. more
l:tlagondary school teachers will be needed. That's us.

ANOTHER III-LITE

Mr. Saba! and Mr. Arthur Jones have asked that the
State College students try to discuss our college with
various students in high school. The point is not to
concentrate on prospective teachers entirely because
this college is a liberal arts school also. The question
which now arises is what to discuss—certainly not
curriculum at this point, certainly not athletics—-
maybe extra-curricular activities. We might get more
freshmen if we enlarge our athletic program. This
might be done by athletic scholarships with money
supplied by Senior class gifts or alumni—just a preg-
nant suggestion.

ETHICS . . .

Many things have been borrowed from various lock-
ers. among them a sorority pin which can be of no
use to anyone—It makes you wonder whether you can
ltruslt either teacher or students on the high school
eve .

FACULTY NOTES

Many of the faculty feel that All-State Night is
ridiculous because it sounds like one night out of the
year that the students mingle with the faculty. Con»
sequently the profs. would like to see another such
night in the spring comparable to a playday. This
isn’t exactly clear in our minds but . . . let's give it
a go, kids.

ATTENTION SENIORS!

All the l‘cdagogue proofs are now available and will
be on display Monday by the class bulletin boards.
FINI

A committee of Seniors has been organized to in-
vestigate increasing the hours granted to practice
teachers. Herb Holland is acting as Chairman and will
accept any and all suggestions!

WITH ABEL BLATTMQN

 

Just what constitutes “home
court" offic.ating? Is it solely the
inadequacies of the officials? or
perhaps their age? Or maybe they
develop a sort of fatherly love for
their own “home court" boys? Ac-
tually tlze situation is this: when a
basketball player has piayed under
the same official a few times. he
begins to figme the official. and
knows r. hat he can get away with;
whether the official will call con-
tact under the boards. outsi'ie picks
and the like. The players learn these
facts and act instinctively in tak-
ing advantage of them. Therefore.
it is partly the fault of the plﬂVGl‘S,
who in their desire to win. ask no
favors and give none. especially to
the refs.

The advantages enjoyed by the
home team may therefore appear to
be tremendous, but. as in baseball
where the home team has the de-
cided advanta’fe of batting last. all
teams reap the same benefits.

I certainly do not wish to encour-
age or condone imperfection in
sports. whether by the officials or
players. but merelv advocate a toler-
ant atiitude. since nothing placed
in the hands of a human being can
ever be perfect.

Also, Mr. Burns. if you are so hot
on this officiating racket. how about
doing something constructive in your
IM League!

On behalf of the Sports Staff and
all the Coaches and teams we want
to wish you all the Merriest of
Chr'd'vnases and the happiest of
New Years! Let's hope Coach Hath-
away gets a six foot nine center for
Xmas!

Varsity To Meet Curry Tonight,-
To Be Final Game Before Xmas

By BOB ASHFIELD

State’s Moimen
Begin Practice

Looking forward to another suc-
cessful season. the State College
wxestling team, led by Hank Feur-

 

back and Tom King, has begun
workouts in Milne Gym. For the
present. Coach Garcia is stressing
fundamentals and conditioning. Ap-
jzroxiinately ei'vhteen men have
turned out to vie for berths on what
looks like a promising team. Return-
in',r veterans also include “Herman”
Schatzle and Joe Lombardi.

The most promising freshman to
date seems to be Leroy Negus. Ne-
gus. who saw plenty of action at
I:ichfor;l High School. would be
an asset to any team. Wrestling in
the 140 pound class. his strength
and speed has brought considerable
praise from Garcia.

King and Fcuerback to Lead Squad

King and Feuerback. who seem to
have developed greater strength and
technique over the summer are aid-
ing- the Coach by attempting to pass
on their skill and knowledge to the
new candidates. For the past two
weeks. they have been holding class-
es during the day from 4 to 6.

Although handicapped by a lack
of funds. Garcia has released a
couple. of tentative matches with
others on the fire. Darrow Prep. a
haven for post high school athletes.
has been scheduled for January 12
and should certainly put the State
team to the test. Plattsburg State
Teachers. who are forming a team
for the first time. are also possibili-
ties.

Tonight State’s lioopsters play host to Curry College
from Boston. Curry is a new addition to State’s schedule this
year and their strength is unknown. The Varsity will be
gunning for their second win of the season, their record be-
ing one win against three losses. State will be at full strength
again tonight with Gerry McDonald back in the lineup after

 

 

his recovery from a foot injury.

 \—/.'3*Win,-
Strong at Finish

After dropping their initial con-
test Friday night to a strong ABC
quintet, the State Junior Varsity
bounded back to eke out a close. one-
point victory over the Utica College
JV’s on Tuesday.

Led by Jack Fernandez. who gar-
nered eight points and sparked the
offense, the JV’s Were forced to play
top-notch ball as they trailed 16 to
10 at the half. Bob DeMichiell,
State's high scorer Friday night, was
the victim of a sprained ankle in the
first half and saw only limited ac-
tion after that. however. Fernandez
and Bob Sage started clicking to
overcome the lead Utica had built
up and then went on to win in the
final moments of the game, 28-27.

In the preliminary to the Harpur
game last Friday. the JV's suc-
cumbed to the hard-driving busi-
nessmen from ABC. 74-50. The State
five got off to a very slow start as
ABC really put the pressure on in
the first half. Thev kept piling tip
points in the beginning of the sec-
ond half and the Feds were hone-
lesslv down at the end of three
quarters. Nevertheless. State put on
an impressive show in the final
quarter and cut down the margin
considerably.

In the two games played to date,
the JV‘s have shown a tendency to
come on with a rush in the last half
of tbn came. If they can keep this
up all year, it will mean pulling a
lot of close games out of the fire.

With DeMichiell and Fernandez
showing great promise. and Comely,
Bonnet. and Sage roundingr out a
well-balanced first five. the JV's
can look forward to a profitable sea-
son.

Last Tuesday night. State’s Var-
sity journeyed to Utica where they
were downed by Utica College 77-61.
The game was actually decided in
the second quarter when Utica got
“hot” and doubled State’s output of
15 points to go ahead by a de-
cisive 10 point marvin. Half-time
score was Utica 41. State 31.

State Starts St"ong. . .Flnishes Weak

State seemed to have the
game well under control during the
i'.rst quarter. Two quick baskets by
Taber made the score 4-0, then using
the fast break effectively, state op-
ened up an 11-3 margin. Utica start-
ed hitting in the closing minutes of
the quarter and a long. last second
set shot by Coltetti made the score
16-11 in favor of Albany.

The second quarter found Alba-
ny no match for the Utica boys
who with 4 quick baskets took
the lead 19-18. Control of the hack-
boards and a fast-breaking offense
were combined by the Utica team
to score many of its points.

Allassio, Iloppey Pace Scoring

Second half play was fairly even
with Utica adding a few points to
their margin. Allassio, Hoppey, and
Palzcak all turned in good per‘orm-
ances to keep State within striking
distance of Utica. Valenzi. Fitgerald,
and Colletti were outstanding for the
winners. Valenzi scored many of his
25 points by using a deadlv hook
shot. Fitzgerald stood out for his
all around plav and it was his lead-
ership that sparked Utica through-
out the game. Fitzgerald garnered
15 points and teammate. Colletti.
added 13 more. Allassio and Hopney
tied for scoring honors for State,
with each dropping in 11 points.

Two fatcors that were disadvan-
tages to the statesmen were the
huge court. which they are unac-
customed to playing on, and the
sensitiveness of the baskets, which
lost many a point for Albany.
