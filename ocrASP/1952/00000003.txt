 At 433:. I:

By ABEL BLATTMAN

 

This column affords us the first
opportunity to fall in line with the
other organizations on campus and
extend a hearty welcome to the
tfass of ’56. It is with a great deal
of sincerity that we do this, for
in the hands of the fresh class, in
a large sense. rests the future suc-
cess of athletics at State. We are
all counting on the ‘Bees' to take
an active interest in the athletic
program. support it. and partici-
pate in it. as we know they will.

This year finds us upon the crest
of a momentous wave of progress
marked by last year's advances. IM
football has become a 9-man game.
an important preliminary to the
fielding of an inter-collegiate foot-
ball team; the football report is
due sometime around Christmas of
this year. and wil probably lead to
more concrete steps and ultimately
to the creation of a State College
Varsity Football team.

The fine showing of the Varsity
Soccer team against tough opposi-
tion. the addition of new teams to
the schedule last year coupled with
a rigorous 10 game slate this year
clearly evidences the progress of
the squad under the tutelage of Joe
Garcia.

Inter-collegiate basketball roar-
ed to a winning season for the first
time since the sport was re—esta-
blished at State after the last war
with Coach Merlin Hathaway at
the reins.

The Varsity Baseball squad, ac-
tively building for the future with a
young squad. took great strides to
this end.

All of these factors evidence the
building of the athletic program
during the past eight years which
has now gained some momentum.
It’s “feasible” that this year the
students at State will help to keep
it rolling.

SCAAB 'To IBelSp‘or‘is impetus

 

Now in the process of drawing up
a strong working cohst'itution‘, the
newly formed State College Athletic
Associaticn Board may prove to be

stronger athletic program,

The board will be the pblicy-
making body for all inter-collegiate
athletics. The board consists of
three members of the student body,
elected for a two-year term, the
athletic coach. and two members of
the faculty, appointed by the ad-
ministration.

Nine. Marietta"): «

.[V

On the board for the your 1952-

1953 are SA members Paul Ward.
Pal. Carlo. and Jim Finnen. The
faculty members are Mr. Jones and
Mr. Tibbcts. Coach Memo W. Hath-
away will serve in an advisory capa-
city to the board as well as secre-
till'y.

Probably the most outstanding or-
dci' of business for the members of
this year's board will be the pre-
srntaiion to the student body as to
whether or not all inter-collegiate
football program is "feasible."

Tllt‘ Men's Athletic Assoolution is
it separate organization and will be
concerned primarily with the func-
tioning of the intro-mural pl'ogrulll.
