Cannon’s Return
Bolsters Squad

Tomorrow afternoon at 2 o’clock
Joe Garcia's soccer squad will open
the ‘52 campaign when they engage
New England College on Beverwyck
1' ieid. Noted as a soccer school for
many years throughout New Hamp-
shire. New England promises to field
a powerful squad against State.

Team Shows Steady Improvement

Probably one of the brightest
spots during the week was the re-

turn to action of Al Cannon. Since _

Cannon’s return to the lineup the
cntie squad has shown marked im-
1 rovement and already has begun to
shape up as a well-balanced team.

Practice during the past week has
centered around conditioning and
basic fundamentals. Pre-season
practice has been hampered by the
lack of time, sickness of key men,
and the lack of enough men to hold
ieal scrimmage sessions at any time.
Because of this the starting lineup
may well be built around those who
bcst fit the two qualifications.

Newcomers Showing Promise
There are 10 iettermen returning
from last year's squad. which means
a crcup of seasoned veterans will
form the nucleus of this year's
squad. But so far. several other
iicwcomers have shown promising
form and many of the veterans may
have to really work to obtain the
nod over the "rookies." Bright spots
from the frosh class are Don Sny-
der, “Rebel” Hockmuth. Jack
Hughes and Dick Pfiffer. Other
promising candidates are Don Leln
and Don Canonica. Sophomores, al-
so Joe Luce. Junior. All in all. things
look much better now than in the
beginning" when Joe Garcia was
faced with the loss of five key men.

Twenty men will be in uniform
for all varsity games. Those not
making the varsity squad will form
a junior varsity squad which will
also play a schedule.

SOCCER SLAN'I‘S

. . . Cannon's return could mean
difference between a good season
and a mediocre one. . . . “Red” Mc-
Cormick and Joe Luce are on sick
list. . . . Jack Hughes could be one
of the 'i‘uilbacks Joe Garcia is look-
lllg' for. . . . among veterans Ben
Button has been outstanding. . .
iii-n plays hard game both on of-
fcnsc and defense. . . . Raoul Nunez
could help squad a great deal. . . .
“Rebel” llockmiith is small but bus
speed and a lot of “know how." . .
a little moral support from the fans
ill State could help the team a lot.

. they're doing their part—how
about you?
