Dr. Shaw also advises that the
Fulbright Program for foreign study
has now been broadened to include
Western Germany. Seniors and
graduate students desirous of study-

countries covered by the Fulbright
Program are urged to see Dr. Shaw,

the deadline for ﬁling applications
may be met.

 

Salt tears flooded the Atlantic
Ocean on September '7 of last year,
as parents and friends wished the 62
students sailing for France on the
EMS. Moritania 3. “Bon Voyage."

Among those students was Jean
Simon, who, after studying for two
years’at State, was taking advant-
age of an opportunity Sweet Briar
College, Virginia, offers students of
French to spend their Junior year
studying at France. Dr. M. Annette
Dobbin, on a leave of absence from
State. also took the trip as Assist-
ant Director of the group.

After landing at Le Havre, the en-
tire group went on to Tours for six
weeks of intensified study. and then
were split into small groups for the
remainder of their stay.

With a schedule that included
three 1 pm classes a week, one 10:30
a day, and one 2 p. m. a month,
Jean had plenty of time for sight-
seeing. Living with a French family
in Montparnasse also afforded Jean
an opportunity to really get to know
the French people. Montparnasse is
the "artists' quarter" of Paris, and

QUALITY CIGARETTE

TO OFFER BOTH REGULAR & KING-SIZE

BOTH regular and king-size
llhesterfields are premium quality
cigarettes and come in the smart
white pack.

BOTH contain only those proven in-
gT‘ediFénts that make Chesterfieids
the best possible smoke: the
world’s best tobaccos, pure, more
costly moistening agents (to keep
them tasty and fresh), the best
cigarette paper that money can
buy— nothing else.

BOTH are much milder with an ex-
traordinarily good taste and, from
the report of a well-known research
organization — no unpleasant
after-taste.

BOTH are exactly the some in all re-
spects. There is absolutely no difference
except that king-size Chesterfield is
larger—contains considerably more of
the same tobaccos—enough more to
give you a 2I% longer smoke, yet costs
vary Lily-0 more.
