Thurlow To Play Potter,-
KB’ Vs. Summit House

Fraternity Teams

Take First Games

This afternoon a proven Potter
team meets Thurlow for the latter’s
first trial on Beverwyck Park. The
Dorm Field will feature a strong
KB team playing Summit House in
Summit's first official game. Mon-
day, SLS is scheduled to play Van-
derzee on Beverwyok. while the
Finks wil ltangle with The Steelers
on Dorm Field.

Wednesday afternoon KDR took
a 10-0 decision from the the Steel—
ers. The game featured hard driving
line play, highlighted by Jim Ben-
net of APA who almost single band-
edly stopped the Steelers offense.
Bob Dreher and Chuck Derwin play-
ed good bail for the losers.

Both APA and the Steelers have
strong and well-balanced teams. but
APA looks like the team to beat
in the Dorm Field League.

KB Defeats Mustangs

Tuesday afternoon KB routed the
Siiyles Hall Mustangs 24 to 0 as
they displayed a fine running and
passing attack. The KB backfield
of Ryder. Wander, Blattman and
Sturm. operating behind a big line.
made that team look like one of
the powers of the Dorm Field Lea-
gue.

On Beverwyck. Tuesday. a pow-
erful Potter Club ramped over the
Tri-City All-Stars. The frosh club
was handicapped from the start,
since they could field only eight
men.

Champlln. Brown Star

The “Club” seems to have hit on
a potent combination again this
year. Ray Champlln appears to be
in his usual fine running and pass-
ing forn‘. Bob Brown, a new addi»
tion to the forward wall. snared
three passes in pay territory. Soph
field general for the boys from 145
State St.. Bob Sage. also played a
fine offensive game. Don Nolan and
Arnie Sohaunburg were the out-
standing players for the badly out-
classed All-Stars.

The "Club" is picked to repeat its
last year's performance again this
year. It is almost certain that they
can win the Beverwyck League, but
the contenders from Dorm Field
should prove troublesome.

Leagues Have Poor Start
Monday, the Dorm Field League
got off to a harmless start as the
Finks forfeited to Summit House.
The game was played out. however.
and resulted in a hard—fought
scoreless tie. Outstanding in this
contest was the sharp passing of
the Fink's Bob DeMichaol and the
stubborn defensive play of the hust—
ling frosh from Summit House.

The start of the Bcvei‘wyok Len-
guc proved as futile as the one on
Dorm Field. The SLS-Tliurlow tilt

was cancelled because the “old had
not been lined.

Sm’Wd/i mm State Again Host Team.-
Queens College Invades

By DOT'I‘IE MEIIAN

 

Bouquets of roses and orchids to
the administration and the physi-
cal education department! The fac-
ulty has seen fit to waive the Soph-
omore gym requirement.

The whole mess started when the
physical education department dis-
covered that about one half of the
Sophomore class was not scheduled
to take gym because of conflicts with
the new two hour education lab. On
top of that, certain facilities prom-
ised the gym instructors were not
made available to them. The only
remedy seemed to be to have gym
classes two nights a week.

And then. loud complaints were
heard from all corners of State Col-
lege. The one-third of our student
body that commutes complained.
The State College News‘ editors
complained when they discovered
that the Scphs couldn't work on
Tuesday and Wednesday evenings
when they needed them. The stu-
dents in Stagecraf t and Elementary
Dramatics (who are almost all
Sophomores) complained since they
are required to meet at school at
night for laboratory assignments.
The students in AD. complained
when they remembered previous ex-
periences with the actors on stage
shouting to be heard over the roar
of a basketball game in the gym.
The managers of intramural sports
complained. and so on and so on
and so on.

And in view of all this, the powers
that be waived the Sophomore gym
requirement. We thought that they
would. but only after going through
much red tape. repealing many laws,
and in the meantime producing
much bcdlam. We'd like to express
further opinion and say that it's
about time. With so many demands
being made on our time in subjects
that pertain to our major fields of
interest. or which further our pro-
fessional training, a required course
in gym seems not only unreasonable.
but impossible!

Moreover. there exists on this
campus a well-planned program of
individual and team sports in the
forms of intramurals. rivalry sports.
and WAA activities. Silica there are
no physical education majors here.
we can assume that any interest
shown in sports is for pleasure 01'
relaxation. Surely. those activities
can accomplish this elid as com-
potently as a gym class.

With no qualms about being rc-
pctitious. we want to say. “thanks
again" to the administration for
coming up with a delightful and
workable solution to a mess. We
litpc ii. is ii. permanent Improve-
ment. and not. a temporary measure

Statesmen Down
New England 5-0
For Initial Win

Again tomorrow afternoon State's
soccer squad will play host. this
time to a Queens College outfit.
Hoping to continue their masterful
ways. State will probably go along
with the same lineup which com-
bined to make the first victory look
easy. State will be favored to chalk
up win number two.

State Rolls to Easy Victory

Last Saturday a comparatively
fair New England College squad saw
how soccer should really be played
when the Statesmen mauled them
for a 5-0 victory. New England nev-
er displayed any of the power that
they were supposed to have. In fact,
there was a complete reversal.
Goalie Telfer could have just as well
brought his rocking chair along as
he had to exert effort only on seven
occasions to stop opposing shots. In
a further breakdown. only two could
have been classified as shots.
Stella Turns in Great Performance

On the other side of the ledger.
State's points were countered by Bill
Adams. Tom King. and Al Cannon
with King and Cannon each boot-
ing the ball past the goalie twice.
Joe Stella was probably the out-
standing player of the day. Stella
as halfback was constantly booting
the ball downfield into scoring po-
sition. His defensive play was one
of the reasons why most of the
game was played in New England’s
territory. Cannon's play. although
creditable. could not be considered
on a par with last year’s. King,
Strickland. McCormick and Button
also were key men in State‘s attack.
Button was injured late in the first
half and was forced to sit out the
remainder of the game.

Fresh Look Good

New faces in the lineup who look
like they will be steady performers
for Coach Garcia's squad are Jack
Hughes. who played a good game at
fullback. and Don Snyder, who cov-
ercd a lot of ground on the wing
position. Dick Pi‘iffcr and "Rebel"
Hockmuth made good showings in
their soccer debut.

Next weekend the team journeys
to the North Country for two games.
They will engage Plattsburg State
Teachers College on Friday after-
noon aiid then take on Champlain
College Saturday before returning
home.
