This week there is a display case
in the library devoted to the com-

azines are devoted to every phase
of business and commerce. In the
exhibit the ﬁelds of advertising. re-
tailing, and accounting are particu—
larly pertinent.

The best policy to follow when
your team drops a contest is to ac-
cept the loss graciously, grit your
teeth, and go on supporting it. But
once in a while a gripe is called for,
and in the following cases we think
it is.

The State Soccer squad fell to
defeat last Saturday to Champlain.
3-0. Not taking anything away from
Champlain. we think We shouldn’t
have lost that one. We’re not even
blaming the ofﬁcials. We’re not
condemning the team. a great bunch
of guys an-i a classy outﬁt. We
don’t know how much the coach is
to blame, or whether he is at all.

What beat our team, and broke
their streak at three. was the sched-
ule. Soccer is no child’s play. It's
rough enough on the guys practic-
ing every night and playing one
game a week. but two in as many
days is ridiculous. It's almost com-
parable to asking a team to play
two football games in a similar
amount of time. The last weekend's
road trip was followed by two days
of practice and a trip to Syracuse.
for another game, then another
home on Saturday. Even if the
guys love the sport. that's too much
to ask from them.

From our acquaintance with
Coach Garcia both editorially and
playing under his coaching. we
know that he has the interests of
his men at heart. We know that
if it is in his power to avoid this
ever recuring. he will do it. Let's
hope that whoever is responsible
has learned a lesson. both in jeop-
ardizing our record, and in over-
taxing our athletes.

Got the answer to the query pos-
ed in this column last week re—
garding the IM football mixup con-
cerning the league commissioner.
Seems that the right info wasn’t in
the right person's or persons' hands
at the right time. A harmless mis-
take perhaps. but since we feel that
the dealings of any student run or-
ganization on campus is the busi-
ness of all students. and that all
actions by these organizations
should be openly arrived at. we
were fortunate to be in a position
to bring this to the attention of the
student body.

We sincerely hope. in this case
also, the responsible parties will
proﬁt from their mistakes. and not
repeat them.

GRIPE l)El‘T.:
Beverwyck league had more fox—
feits than games played. Pretty
stringent rules about forfeits. should
be the same for lining the field.
Our personal experience has been
that not one game has started on
time because of this si‘uation.

LAUGHS DEPT: Should be close
to a riot tomorrow when the Ain-
letic “faction” meets the D&A "fuc-
tion" on the soccer ﬁeld in n prc-
llm to the varsity contest.

suin’ Wit/s Malian

By DOTTIE MEHAN

 

Organized team sports under the
supervision of WAA will begin
Wednesday of next week when com-
petitive volleyball begins. Various
group houses have formed teams.
selected captains and have arrang-
ed to participate. The schedule of
games will be posted on the WAA
bulletin board.

We don't know exactly why it is.
but it seems that organized com-
petition commands a great deal
more participation and enthusiasm
than the games, such as hockey
and soccer. played with pick-up
teams. Perhaps it’s the ago-old
question of establishing and dis-
playing “esprit de corps" to uphold
the honor of your own particular
group house. In any event, we’re
anxious to see the advent of the
competitive volleyball season be-
cause it may provide to be the
“shot in the arm” WAA needs this
year.

To clarify that statement. it is
very deﬁnitely not intended as a
:iom at WAA. a group that is very
well organized and efﬁicently man—
aged, but rather as a statement of
fact. WAA does need a “shot in
the arm" since participation in the
sports this fall has not been. on
the whole. overwhelming. More-
over. the only people who can give
WAA the needed remedial boost
are the women on this campus
since they are WAA.

With that. we'll climb down from
the soapbox with an eye toward the
volleyball season. expecting to see
an improvement.

Mixed doubles in ping-pong will
begin in two weeks. so ﬁnd yourself
a partner and sign up on the WAA
bulletin board if you're interested.
These toumaments can be an aw-
fuly lot of fun if you make them
that way.

Hathaway's Call
For H00psier
Brings '55 Men

Last Wednesday afternoon ﬁfty-
ﬁve basketball candidates for the
‘52-'53 team reported to Coach Mer-
lin Hathaway. The ﬁrst practices
have been directed toward getting
the players in shape for the tough
twenty game schedule. However.
these early practices have been hin-
dered by late afternoon labs and
the fact that all candidates have
not taken their required physical
examinations.
Veterans Return

Except for the loss of Tom Hop-
pey, and Captain Bob Brown, last
year's varsity is still intact. These
holdovers. including Bob Tabor, Hy
Walker. John Contra. Bud Prout,
John Zongrone, Gerry McDonald,
Claude Palczak. and John Allusio.
will probably form the nucleus of
this year's team. Although Brown's
heady floor play and Hoppey's scor-
ing punch will undoubtedly be miss-
ed. there is a good chance that
someone among the many new
faces can step in to ﬁll the gap.

Many veterans from Joe Garcia's
ﬁne Junior Varsity team of last
year will also be ﬁghting for Var—
sity berths. Fernandez. Combs, Ben-
nett. DeMichiell. Comley. Sage.
Conn. and McKay will sharpen the
competition for Varsity positions.
Labs, Meals Hamper Organization

Conch Hathaway's organizing job
will be made more difﬁcult by the
late afternoon labs which prevent
the team from working together
every day. Also. the players living
at Sayles Hall cannot practice until
six o'clock or they will miss their
evening meals. There is some hope
that. through the combined efforts
of the Administration. Athletic As-
sociation. and group houses this
unfortunate situation can be rem—
edied.

Peds Lose To
Strong Orange
In Road Battle

Returning once again to familar
Beverwyck Field tomorrow. Coach
Joe Garcia's soccer squad will be
aiming at obtaining their true form
by trouncing Oswego State Teach-
ers College. As a home team State
has yet to be scored against, while
racking up 8 goals against New
England College and Queens Col-
lege. So far State has looked un-
beatable while playing before the
home fans. The defense has been
very strong and the offense has
worked as a well co-ordinated force.
statesmen Bow to Orange

In perhaps the toughest game of
this year's slate, the Peds succumb-
ed to a powerful Syracuse Varsity
6-1. The Orange, boasting a victory
over Brockport this year, started 011’
with a goal in the ﬁrst 25 seconds
of play. The lead was increased to
4-0 before Tom King scored on an
artist from Rebel Hochmuth for
State's only tally.

Slate Splits on Road Trip

State returned home last Satur-
day night with their victory skein
stopped at three. Champlain was
the culprit with a 3-0 whitewash.
The previous day had found State
victorious over Plattsburg 4-2. But
the s;ores are not the whole story
of the trip to the North Country.
In Champlain. State found that the
rules they are accustomed to using
do not correspond to those used by
the Blue and White team. Accord-
ing to some reliable sources, the
most serious offense was of the riﬂe
regarding the hazing of the goalie.
Goalie Telfer was subjected to such
treatment throughout the game
and at one time it nearly resulted
in a serious injury. The victorious,
but tired Peds went over to Cham-
plain. The nctions of the previous
day began to tell on the fellows and
they were unable to OVercome the
stronger and fresher squad.

The decision of the Plattsburg
and Champlain coaches to waive
the free substitution rule hindered
State. Their chances to overcome
the disadvantages of the two—game
road trip were lessened as they
could not use their 19 man squad
advantageously.
