For Blood Donors

 Veteran Will Sp’eolt
For Student Action

In order to meet the critical
shortage of blood, the Albany
County Chapter of the American
Red Cross is sponsoring a drive to
recruit blood donors, Konrad Maier
’54, the promotional director of the
campaign advises.

In conjunction with the drive,
Peter L. Marshall, a Marine vet-
eran of World War II will speak
in assembly today. Marshall, who
served for 32 month in the Pacific
Theater of Operations, was wound-
ed twice and received eight blood
transfusions.

Anyone between the ages of 18
and 59 inclusive, may give blood.
If the giver is under 21 years, per-
mission slips must be signed by a
parent or guardian. These permis-
sion slips must be taken to the
Bender Laboratory on the date of
donation. The men donors must
weigh 125 lbs. and the women don-
ors must weigh at least 110 lbs.

All donors are advised to eat only
fruit or vegetable juices, clear tea
or coffee, bread or toast, four hours
before coming to the Center.

Appointments for the donation of
blood can be made at the Bender
Laboratory. 136 South Lake Ave-
nue.

Exceptional athletes can gener-
ally be divided into one of three
major categories: There are the
colorful ones, who supply the hu-
man'interest in the game, whether
it be their personality or style of
play that impresses one: the con-
sistent athlete, who invariably
turns in a steady and commendable
game; and finally the athlete who
possesses one characteristic that
probably encompasses some of the
others, he is the one with class.
This type of guy has that added
bit of finesse, that intangible some-
thing that separates him from all
other ball-players. He is a ball-
player's ball-player.

The number of this type of com-
petitor is very limited. Many teams
don’thave even one such player,
and it ’is a rarity when a team
comes up with more than one.

We are..fortunate' in having a
player of this caliber on the State
(‘ollege Varsity Soccer team. That
player is our goalie, Pete Telfer.
'l‘elf never played soccer before
coming to bbute, but, he is one of
the best that we‘ve ever seen since
the sport was begun at this institu-
tion, opponents included.

His consistently fine kicking his
poise in the heat of battle, are ev—
idence of his class as an athlete.
In the field of competition he
knows what to do, how to do it.
and how to look good in doing it.
[Although a good portion of this
ability is inherent, the greater part
of it is the desire for perfection.
and the diligence necessary in at—
taining this perfection.

The fact that he has learned un-
der one of the better soccer coach-
es. has been an added boon to the
State Soccer team, and thereby the
student body of State.

Pete's class as a ballplayer is not
limited to soccer. It exists in bas-
ketball, softball and other competi-
tive endeavors. His broad interest»;
and outstanding achievements in
other fields make him a tribute to
this college in more ways than one.
We are proud to be in a position
to give him the public acclaim he
deserves.

HATS OFF DEPT: to the Var-
sity Soccer players who are donat—
ing their time and talent in the

are displaying one of the finest
attributes anyone can in helping

State To Wind Up  Trips

Hathaway Starts
00p Practice
For Tough Year

The required physical examina-
tions have been given to the has-
ketball candidates and the Hath-
awaymen have begun practicing in
ernest for the grueling twenty-game
schedule. Workouts previous to
these exams had been limited to
running, calisthenics, and pickup
games not directed by Coach Hath-
away. In the forthcoming practices
Hathaway will probably trim down
the 55-man squad and separate the
players to the varsity and junior
varsity teams.

Newcomers Look Good

According to all reports, many
fresh and transfers look like they
might hustle some of last year‘s
veterans for positions on the J.V.
and varsity. Except for the loss of
Tom Hoppey, Al Peachy, Art Weig-
and, and Captain Bob Brown, last
year's varsity is still intact. Hold-
overs, including Bo‘o Tabor. Hiram
Walker. John Contra. Bud Prout,
John Zongronc. Gerry McDonald,
John Allaslo, and Claude Palczak.
will probably form the nucleus of
this year's team. However. none of
those men have their positions sew~
ed up. and will have to beat out
scmral of the newcomers in the race
for their old positions.

Many veterans from Joe Garcia's
fine junior vars-1t ' team of last year
will also be fighting for varsity
berths. Combs. Fernandez. DcMi-
chicll, Bennett, Comlcy. Sage, Conn.
and McKay will sharpen the com-
petition for the varsity positions,
Labs Remain Obstacle

The late afternoon labs which
were expected to prevent the team
from practicing together still loom
as the main obstacles which have
to be overcome. Many of the voter-
ans from last year are science ma-
jors and have one or more labora—
tories per week which keep them
from practice. A team naturally has
to work out together to produce a
winning crmbination. So it seems
that. unless this unfortunate situ-
oLion can bc rcmedicd. our hopes for
a successful basketball season will
be seriously tln'ontrncd.

If you were asked to pick the
quality or asset in a person that
makes that person outstanding in
athletics, what would you mention?
Perhaps you might think first of
skill and know-how. or of good,
level-headed intelligence, or old-
fashioncd horse sense. Or calm cool
thinking in the heat of competition
might count with you. Maybe you
would consider a-thorough working
knowledge of the rules and intrica-
sies of the game" essential in your
criteria.

Certainly all of these qualities go
into the making of a good athlete,
and when combined with a sense of
how to subordinate one’s self for
the working excellence of a team,
you have on your hands a sports—
man worthy of recognition.

A walking example 01 this ideal
athlete is Marilyn Wittschen. Dur-
ing the fall sports season, Marilyn
shines on the hockey field, playing
her game with the complete effort-
lessncss that is the mark of a mas-
. r. i—ler style and form show expert
r.;.1ching and training, and yet
while watching her, you are never
aware of her care in this matter.
since it appears to be so eaSy for
her.

Marilyn plays a particularly good
defensive game, instinctively plac-
ing hcr.elf where she sees she is
most. needed. She has a fast, power-
ful and accurate drive that is so
imporiant for a halfback. No
amount of tension or excitement
pcrturbs this girl. She remains calm,
thinking quickly and intelligently
even at the highest pitch of a close
game.

Moreover. her unusual grace and
prowess is not confined to hockey.
Marilyn handles almost any sport
you might mention with the same
degree of perfection she achieves in
hockey.

Stella's Goal
Wins Margin
Over Oswego

Beverwyck Field will be vacant
this weekend since State's soccer
team does not have any games
scheduled. Next Wednesday the Peds
will again take to the road, this
time, with hope of bettering their
previous showings. Union College,
somewhat of an “arch rival," will
furnish the opposition. Reports have
it that the Union players are "up"
for this contest. The Union clash
will be the last away game, the Arn-
old-State contest being scheduled
for yesterday.

State Edges Oswego 2-1

Last Saturday, state continued its
masterful ways at home by outlast-
lng Oswego State 2-1. The Feds were
hampered from the beginning by
the loss of Al Cannon. To fill up
the vacancy various shifts in the
lineup were made. Probably the
most effective was the switching of
Joe Stella from halfback position to
a forward post. Stella came through
with the game’s winning goal, and,
according to many observers. it was
one of the most impressive goals of
the campaign.

Oswego Scores First

Oswego, in their initial play, def-
initely seemed on the way to post-
ing their first victory of the year as
they tallied their only goal in the
opening minutes of play. State, not
10 be outdone, bean to overcome the
disadvantages of the re-arranged
Lneup and gained a 1-1 tie at the
end of the first half. This goal came
by virtue of George Wood’s “bank”
shot which actually was booted in
by an Oswego player. The last half
of the game was played mostly in
Oswego territory. Although State
had numerous opportunities to
score, they capitalized only once,
that being on Stella’s goal.

The game as a whole could not
be considered as well played as
most of State's games. It seemed
that. at times in the final half that
some of the half-time performers
had not left the field. But since Os-
wcgo's play was not any better or
as gocd most of the time, it was
better to get this one bad game “out
of their systems," while not losing
any more than a little prestige.

J.V.'s To Play First Game

Tomorrow afternoon State's J.V.‘s
will play host to Middletown at Bev-
erwyck Field. This is the first game
for the J.V.'s, so many of the fel-
laws will be seeing their first real
action.

So far this your State has scored
a total of 14 goals, while the opposi-
tion have scored 12. On the home
ficll the total stands 10 for State.
and only one for the opponents
which further indicates the supre-
macy of State at home.
