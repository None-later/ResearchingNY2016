the amount of government patron-
age. Soon the royal patronage sys-
tem was out of proportion to an
equitable taxation. As Dr. Hung ob-
served, “Royal patronage is not an
American innovation but a Chinese
discovery." In this instance as so
many others, the spontaneous wit
and humor of Dr. Hung did not
altogether conceal what was per-
haps the main intent of the lee-
ture—to show us that China does
not stand alone in her follies.

The afternoon lecture concerning
Tu Fu, Chinese poet of the eighth
century AD, subject of one of Dr.
Hung’s latest literary works, and
the greatest Chinese poet in a cul-
ture renowned for its literary pro-
liﬂcacy, dealt with China Proper.
China Proper—productive China——
contributed to the world, the arts
of poetry, painting and cooking. Tu
Fu, master of all Chinese poetry
up to his day. innovated more col-
loquial forms in which he “. . . in-
terpreted the world and his own
time,” for all time.

Dr. Hung. one of the great in-
tellects of n starving age. cautioned
his audience to weigh the merits
of the world’s current ideologies
realizing that, “. . . you cannot ﬁght
ideas with money or guns . . . but
(rather) through education, that be-
ing the reason that I speak to you

eration"

a rather perturbed woman discov--
ered that due to the accident, her
wrist watch had turned green. She
reported this to the nearest police
station where the incident was
filed under the heading of “The
Greening Shower of Pizza”.

Here are “10 ways to get through
college without even trying," as
written in Pageant magazine by
frot. Robert Tyson of Hunter Col-
ege:

1. Bring the professor newspaper
clippings dealing with his subject.
If you don’t find clippings dealing
with his subject, bring in clippings
at random. He thinks everything
deals with his subject.

2. Look alert. Take notes eagerly.
If you look at your watch, don’t
sgare at it unbelievingly and shake

3. Nod frequently and murmur
“How true." To you, this seems ex-
aggerated. To him, it's quite objec-
tive.

4. Sit in front, near him. (Applies
only if you intend to stay awake.)

5. Laugh at his jokes. You can
tell. If he looks up from his notes
and smiles expectantly he has told
a joke.

6. Ask for outside reading. You
don't have to read it. Just ask.

'7. If you must sleep. arrange to
be called at the end of the hour.
It creates an unfavorable impres-
sion if the rest of the class has left
and you sit there alone, dozing.

8. Be sure the book you read dur-
ing the lecture looks like a book
from the course.

9. Ask any questions you think he
can answer. Conversely, avoid an-
nouncing that you have found the
answer, and in your brother’s sec-
ond reader at that.

10. If you know he’s written a
book or an article. call attention to
his writing by asking in class if he
wrote it.

'ike' Emerges Victorious
in State's Straw Vote

 

Survey Continues

GOP Tradition

As the nation goes to the polls
this Tuesday. State College will al-
ready have selected its presidential
choice, having, for the fourth con-
secutive time. given the Republican
nominee preference in the race for
the top office of the land. In the
political poll conducted last Friday,
with 761 or 58.5% of the student
body participating, Dwight D. Eis—
enhower, Republican candidate for
the presidency. received 63% of the
votes cast for that office. His clo-
sest contestant. Governor Adlai E.
Stevenson, garnered 36% of the
ballots cast for president, while the
remaining 1% of the votes were

divided among Thomas. Hallinan,,

Russell, and Taft.
Vote Continues Tradition

The vote this year is in keeping
with the tradition that State Col—
lege is Republican. Only once in the
twenty-four years that the poll has
been conducted has a Democratic
candidate been given the margin of
victory, this being in 1936 when. by
a narrow margin, the Association
chose the late Franklin D. Roose—
velt.

Of the 58.5"} of the Student Body
participating in this year's poll.
only 13.5% listed themselves as
voters. this being an 8.4"l reduc—
tion in qualified voters from last
year. The Eisenhower-Stevenson
contest among the voters was rel-
atively close. Eisenhower receiving
(’2 votes to Stevenson's 41. The
non-voters. however, swung the
percentages heavily in favor of the
Republican nominee. granting him
413 of their votes. while casting 287
for the Governor.

Facts Show Reverse In 'l‘rcnd

Significant is the fact that Nor-
man Thomas, who polled 8.7"; of
the student vote in 1948. could
muster only two votes in this year‘s
balloting. thus reversing the Soci-
alist trend apparent in the lust
