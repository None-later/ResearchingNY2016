Wise Move

Attention Student Association - - - you’re money
is about to be spent rather foolishly today. We re-
fer to the proposed Student Facilities Board budget.
Take a look at it' and then raise your questions in
assembly. They need answering. "

If we’re going to get a Television set, we want
a good one, of course, but why so much audio-
visual equipment? We want good equipment, cer-
tainly, but is it necessary to go to such excesses
in quality as $2.50 decks of cards, $5 chess sets,
etc., when such things will receive heavy usage and
doubtless be lost? If they’re to be that valuable,
we’d better sign them out and in and count cards
and pieces after each usei

Quality, But

Student Council made a wise move last Wednes-
day night in discounting consideration and investi-
gation of National Student Association. Council
found nothing objectionable in the organization or
its purposes. Rather, consideration of joining the
National Association was vetoed, and wisely so, we
feel, as inapplicable to this college.

National Student Association is composed of
some 330 colleges and universities throughout the
United States. It is recognized, both on the na-
tional and international scenes, as the voice of the
American student. Basically, its purpose is one of
uniting ideas and efforts to facilitate the solution
of problems common to all colleges, and of lending
an influential voice to the student body of a par-
ticular college having a particular problem. Con-
cretely, NSA works toward drawing the colleges
of the nation together through contests in art, lit-
erature, and sports, and the like, and through con-
ferences on the national, regional, and divisional
levels.

Wednesday night Council was privileged to have
as its guest the President of the Student Senate of
Sierra who did a commendable job in explaining
NSA to the members of Council. He estimated that
the cost of sending each delegate to the national
conference this year (the conference was held in
Indiana) reached approximately $170. In addition.
membership dues includes $50 to the national or—
ganization. plus $20 to the regional group. It must
be admitted that. should we manage the dues, we
are not in a financial positiont to avail ourselves oi
the benefits of the national conference unless it
were held closer to the college. Therefore, it would
seem that our participation would be limited to
the divisional and regional level.

It has been our experience in attending confer-
ences of this nature that the problems of other
smaller schools-r—often those of faculty control of
finances and activities. administrative censorship.
etc.-—~are not our problems; that we are far ahead
in the solution of problems confronting irrost schools
of our size. As a result. we have often found our-
selves in a position of giving ideas, while receiving
little concrete aid ourselves. When we get into the
realm of the larger college, while our problems may
be sirniliar in type. the means of solution available
are nowhere near parallel. Financially, we are at
a disadvantage. We are not a. tuition school and
cannot hope to plan programs such as a budget at
a tuition college will allow.

it was with these thoughts iir mind that this
college could not benefit proportionally with iir~
vestment from membership, and with the under-
standing that Wc may yet receive information on
what has been done iir dealing with any particular
problem, though we remain non-rirembers. simply
by asking for it that we deemed the action of
Student (Touncil wise.
