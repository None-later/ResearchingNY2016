:4 Woman’s ’l/s'ew

By DORIS DOHERTY

This year MAA wished to inau-
gurate an intramural swimming
program. The Jewish Community
Center gave them a choice of one
night for their swimming—the same
evening WAA had contracted the
use of the pool. The plan was for
from fifteen to twenty men to use
the pool with the State College
women. However, since WAA had
already contracted the use of the
pool the men w0uld be allowed only
with WAA‘s consent.

When the proposal went before
WAA Council it was vetoed on the
grounds that:

l. The pool would be too crowd-
ed.

2. Since dlvng had become more
popular with the women and since
it is popular with the men, the
Single board would limit individual
participation.

3. The presence of men would dis-
courage the women from taking
part in the program.

Taken point by point we feel that
WAA Council’s attitude is selfish
and immature. We grant that the
Community Center Pool is small, a
mere 20 by 60 feet and that the fa-
cilities mignt be a little crowded
with from 30 to 50 State students
using the pool. So far, however,
WAA’s interest does not forecast
this. In the past three out of four
weeks. the number of Stateswomeli
using the pool has dropped from a

maximum of 14 to a mere 2 last 7

week.

Probably the novelty of a eo-ed
swimming program would draw near
capacity attendance for the first
session or two. If it were found that
the facilities were too crowded
we're sure the male quota would be
cut. The interest of the students
would probably wane. however, and
attendance would automatically ad-
just itself.

We feel that WAA's third veto
argument is least valid. The women
of State, are in our opinion, adult
enough to swim in the same pool
with men without feeling self eon-
cious in bathing suits or cmbarrused
over their swimming ability.

In conclusion. we feel that WAA
should reconsider its veto of MAA's
proposal for co-ed swimming.

HOOp Practice

Gets Rougher,
Vets Look Good

The State basketball team has
been engaged in strenuous afternoon
practice sessions for the past week.
Coach Merlin Hathaway has been
drilling his candidates in fundamen-
tals. such as passing, shooting, and
dribbling. The players have also
been doing a lot of running to get
their legs and lungs in shape for
the coming season.

Several Candidates Drop Out

Of the original fifty-five men who
came out for basketball, only about
twenty-five are still consistently at-
tending practices. This leaves Hath-
away with only last year's veterans
and a few hustling newcomers to
work with, and if this decline in at-
tendance keeps up, none of the cali-
didates may be cut from the squad.
Coach Uncoopcrative

Because of the unwillingness 0f
Coach Hathaway to cooperate with
the NEWS Sports Stuff. we have
been unable to give any more pert-
inent information about the basket-
ball team.

KB Steelers Vie Again For Honors

KB and the Steelers battled to
another scoreless tie Tuesday. This
game marked the third meeting be-
tween the two clubs. The Steelers
look the first game 6 to 0 in regular
league play. As each team had two
losses during the season, they met in
a playoff game for second place in
the Dorm Field League. The first
game ended in a scoreless tie. The
second clash between the two clubs
was a repetition of the first game.
KB Defense Good

’1 he battle Tuesday raged up and
down the field for the entire thirty-
six minutes of play. Bob Sturm and
chuck DEI'Wlil exchanged punts
from deep in their respective terri-
Lories. KB made two fine goal line
stands. as Ed Cummings and Neil
Ryder sparked the defensive play.

Lose To Union
in Tight Tilt,-
Hockmuth Hurt

Once again this weekend State‘s
soccer aggregation will attempt to
pull themselves from the depth of
despair and defeats when they play
host to Plattsburg State on Bever-
wyck Field. The squad from the
'Burg will be out to even the 4-2 de-
feat they suffered when State jour-
neyed North previously this year
so play can be expected to be hard
and fast.

State Bows to Union 2-1

Last Wednesday State suffered an-
other one of those heart-breaking
one goal defeats, this time Union
was the culprit with a 2—1 win. The
brand of ball displayed throughout
the game did not correspond to the
type expected because of the rival-
ry involved between the two schools.
In contrast each team played a de-
liberate game which was not marred
by any rough or spirited play. Union
broke the scoring ice in the second
period when they scored their two
goals. For a losing team State seem-

' ed to play a more aggressive game

than Union as they were iii Union

' territory a majority of the game.
‘ For the second time this year State
' scored their goal with the aid of
‘ an assist from the opposition. With
' about 5 seconds to go in the game

“Curly” Strickland booted the ball
downfleld, Union’s defense in a mo-
mentary lapse let the ball get by
them and it rolled into the mouth
of the goal for State's only tally.

“ltcbel” licckmuth Injured In Game

Near the end of the game State's
fiery little forward “Rebel” Hock-
muth while trying to block a kick
was hit in the eye. “Rebel” was tak-
en to the hospital where he will be
until this weekend. The seriousness
of the injury has not been determ-
ined. but he will deﬁnitely be out
for the rest of the season. Hock-
lnuth, only a freshman. has been a
vital cog in State’s forward wall
this year and although small he has
made up for that with his speed and
all around "know-how."

Stlite again played a game with-
out. one of their more valuable men.
This time it was Tom King. who
has a bad back and leg. It is hoped
that he will be ready for action
this weekend. King is leading State's
hunters in goals scored and is a
real "pro" when it comes to ball
handling.
