In Straw Voting,

polling. The remaining three write-
ins were divided, one each being
cast for Hallinan, Russell, and Taft.

In the vice-presidential race Re-
publican victory was even more ap-
parent, the totals reading 512 for
Nixon and 243 for Sparkman. Once
again, the vice-presidential berth
was more closely contested among
the voters than the non-voters, the
former giving Nixon a 60 to 42
margin of victory. Write-ins on the
ballots ior vice-president included
two for Douglas, and one each for
Bass, Eisenhower, Thomas, and
Margaret Chase Smith.

The lling for senator produced
a landsiiide victory for Republican
candidate, Irving Ives, who received
80% of the votes cast. The present
senator's heavy margin of victory
may be accounted for by the fact
many students voted _a split ticket,
Stevenson-Sparkman-Ives, combi-
nation. John Cashmere, Democratic
candidate, polled only 146 of the 742
votes cast for the office. In the
write-in column Dr. George Counts,
Liberal candidate, received six
votes, while Harriman and Lamont
polled one each.

It is evident that straw polls at
State have very little in parallel
with the outcome of the national
elections, since Student opinion has
traditionally selected the losmg
candidate. Only once in our records,
in 1936, has the outcome of the
College poll. coincided with the re-
sults as a whole. Complete tabula-
tions of the poll results appear on

Last Tuesday evening saw the pre-
sentation of the second set of AD
Plays. Fran Hopkins and Jack Ja-
cobus gave the audience an evening
of thoughful, well-balanced enter-
tainment.

The tragedy was that type of play
where the characters, action and
setting must contribute to a dam-
inant mood, a mood of complete
disgust for all concerned. Each char—
acter is, in his own way, thoroughly
no good. This mood was capably
transmitted to us Tuesday evening.
A few minor defects. such as need-
less pacing or the lack of proper
buildup for the entrance of Luke,
did not detract too much from the
overall effect. That the mood was

sustained despite an unfortunate
technical mishap is a credit to both
director and cast.

The second play was introduced
as a farce. The end result was a
cross between a farce and a bur-
lesque. I personally thought that
the play cried for a totally burlesque
treatment, but the enthusiastic re-
sponse of the audience seems to
place this critic in a minority of
one. As the farce it was intended
to be, the play was a complete suc-
cess.

I have neglected to mention the
actors for a particular reason. The
AD stage was never meant for “star”
performances.

Ame‘mic Look
Becomes Style

Do you have that wan, anemic
look? If not, you’re just out of
style. All it takes is a little cour-
age and you can acquire same
by undertaking an adventure
like the following:

It was the unearthly hour of
8 a.m. A chill was in the air as
twenty-six brave souls met in
front of Brubacher. A funeral
coach disguised as a station
wagon awaited to take them to
the inner sanctum of Bender
Lab.

Weak from hunger and fright,
they were ushered into a room,
escorted to the “operating to.-
bles," and told: “Relax.”

After the 1V; " needle sank 3/.”
into their flesh, the patients fell
to the floor one by one. Miracu-
lously, all landed on their feet.

Wearing their red badges of
courage, the torrid 26 staggered
to class. What better way to
face a mid-sem?

Last Saturday, State downed
Plattsburg for the second time this
year and by the identical 4-2 score.
George Wood pulled the “hat trick"
by scoring 3 of State's 4 goals. This
is the first time a State player has
scored more than 2 goals in a single
game this year. Bill Adams scored
for State's other tally. State, playing
the game without the injured Tam
King and "Rebel" Hockmuth, had
to wait until the second half before
they could nail down the victory.
The halftime score had found State
and Plattsburg tied at 2-2. Pete Tel-
fer's goal tending again was a de-
termining factor in the game. On
several occasions Telfer stopped
shots that, if they had scored, might
have turned the tide of the game in
the Burg’s favcr. Telfer did not con-
fine his defensive work to the goal
area but advanced at times to dis-
tances which seemed dangerously
far from the goal.

Some of the real veterans of the
squad will be playing their last com-
petitive soccer for State this Satur-
day. Such standouts for the year as
Dean Strickland, “Red” McCormick,
Pete Telfer, Bill Adams will be hard
to replace in next year's lineup. Tom
King, who because of injury will
not be able to play Saturday, is also
a Senior, and would have been play-
Ing his final game.
