APA Continues Pace;
Finks Roll In League '3'

K-Bobbies Take
League .‘Lead

The APA bowling quintet held its
grip on ﬁrst place in League A, while
the K-Bobbies moved‘ into“ the 'top
spot in League B in Tuesday night’s
action in the Menlsu Intramural
Bowling at the Rice Alleys.

In League A competition, Bob
Sinkeidam and Ken Rutley paced
the-APA aggregation to a 2369—1960
rout of Van Derzee. Kappa Beta's
Ed Costillo led them to a narrow
win over the Rousers 1930-1924. In
the ﬁnal A League match, Tom Shu-
manski was the high man for Thur-
low as they handed Summit House
their second loss, 2045-1067.

Pinks Enter League B

The Finks, replacing the Tri—City
team who dropped out of League B,
lost their initial game to the Com-
muters 2106-1732. Due ot the fact
that the Tz'i-City five quit the
league. the SLS team was deprived
of the four points that they gained
via their win over the 'I‘ri-Clty group
last week. But SLS trounced Potter
Club Tuesday. 2126-1829. They were
led by Bob Hughes. Joe Sapko, and
John Zidik. The Finks and SLS will
play the make—up match for the in-
itial week at a later date. The K-
Bobbles eked cut a narrow win over
the Misﬁts, 1869-1866. to move into
the lead in the B League.
Clement High For Week

Joe Clement scored the high triplc
for the week wtih 533. but he was
followed closely by Ken Rutley and

spectively. Ken Rutley also had the
high single of 204 for the day.

Rivals Kick Off
At Dorm Field

Rivalry athletics got under
way last Saturday. Campus Day.
Frosh and Sophs get the chance
to throw themselves at each
other for a second time, tomor-
row, when the football champs
uill come out in all. their glory.
The time for the event is 10:30
and the place is Dorm Field.

About now, with both CIllSSl‘S
having such keen interest,
you’re liable to hear, “We'll
murder you frosh" or “you
Sophs are in for ii. skunking."
At any rate. no matter who the
victor, lots of fun will predom-
inate. It's fairly obvious that
since the Soplis have one year
of rivalry under their belts they
are sure to “jazz it up"; but the
freshman, if their class spirit
so far is any criteria, will be
right in there. along with the
Sophs. encouraging their own
class on to what should be it
thrilling game for all the spec-
tutors.

Tomorrow the State College Soccer
team will bring its 1952 season to a
close. The team, the coach and the
managers deserve all the praise that
can be heaped upon them for a good
job, well done.

The last game of a season always
has an unhappy note about it
though. despite the overall success
of the campaign. When we see the
guys out there on Saturday. there
will be some who are playing their
last Soccer game for State. These
men are the last of the old guard.
the last of the men who through
their hard work have given soccer
a firm spot in State College.

One of the men we have in mind.
Dean Strickland, is going to be miss-
ed sorely by the team and by the
school. Curly has been a standout
as a regular since his freshman
days. and his consistently superior
play has been instrumental in many
victories.

But Curly will unceremoniously
fade from the scene after tomor-
row's encounter. In the eyes of the
public Curly will be forgotten very
soon. There will be others to take
his place on the field. Someday,
probably an adequate replacement
for him will be found. We're sure
Curly accepts this all as part of the
game and as for us. this ever-
changing nature of athletics, has
always helped to make it the fascin—
ating thing it is.

The IM playoffs are proceeding
along in fine fashion, now that the
“traditional bi-weekly rivalry" is
over. There is one trouble. however.
and that is that the games have be-
come a race against time, and in
the first contest, the clock won.
Potter vs. Steelers in the semis was
called because of darkness with six
minutes to play. Number one on our
hit parade: Turn Back the Hands

of Time.

....IF: If we had an intercollegiate
football team here at State, and if
Ray Wolfe and I were picking the
team from the IM ranks the follow-
ing men would make up the roster:

Offense
Combs E. R. Brown
A. Brown T. T. Carlo
Victor G. D. Miller
C. Egert
Walker B. Morrissey
J. Smith B. Strauber

Final Cut Lists
For Basketball

Coach Merlin Hathaway will
probably announce the basketball
cut list by this weekend. Since only
about thirty candidates have been
attending practice consistently, just
a few will be cut. The competition
has been very keen for berths on
the Varsity and J.V.

Organization of practices has
been facilitated since many of the
troublesome late afternoon labs have
been switched. Hathaway’s main
problem now is to find a capable re-
placement for Bob Brown. the cap-
tain of last year's fine team. This is
no small order, since Brown was the
team’s leading rebounder and play-
maker. besides being a vital cog on
defense.

Prospects Look Better

Two transfers, Bob Gillespie from
Champlain and Nels LaRoe from
Slena, have plenty of experience and
have looked good in practice. De-
Combs has been rebounding well and
gives every indication of being
ready to make the big jump from
J.V. to Varsity. Along with Combs,
the other players from last year's
Junior Varsity seem to be potential
Varsity material. With these boys
coming up. and with most of last
year‘s Varsity returning. and with
several transfers and frosh showing
well, there is a real battle for Var-
slty positions.

Joe Garcia's J.V. team will con-
sist mostly of freshmen or Sopho-
mores who do not make the Varsity.
Since Garcia will also be handling
the wrestling club this winter. he
will probably assign seine upper—
classnian to assist him in coaching
the J.V.'s.

Potter Eliminates
Steelers In First _

James Fox ’54. announced a new
IM football play-off schedule. Under
thisde plan, Potter Club battled
the Steelers. and KB clashed with
APA in the semi-finals. The winners
will meet Tuesday. Nov. 11 at 4,
pm. The reason for the changes in
the semi-ﬁnals matches. according

‘ to Fox. is that KB and the Steelers

took the floor for the next round of
games. Phi Delta held Gamma Kari
to ﬁve pomts while they scored
seven tallies in the game. The play-
ing was slow and much time was
lost in serving when there was some
discussion as to what constituted a
legal serve.

With Betty Miller sparking the
Phi Delts with her powerful serve
and quick returns, the team took
the second game easily with a score
of 11-3.

Psi Gamma sorority and Newman
Hall played lhi'ce fast. close games
to wind up the night's competition.
Sis Deloria. a freshman. helped her
team from Newman to victory as if

The second game of the set went

other game to name the winners of
the series. Another good, close game
saw Newman Hall on top to the
tune of 12-11

It was observed that most. of th:‘

tem was inaugurated.

Morrissey I‘ossesTD Pass

In the ﬁrst game of the semiﬁnals,
Potter squeezed out a 12-6 thriller
against the Steelers. The “Club”
took an early lead when John Mor-
rissey tossed a touchdown pass to
Paul Victor. Again in the ﬁrst half.
John unlimhered his arm and
chucked an aerial to George Schaertl
in the end zone. Morrissey and Vic-
tor both starred throughout the
contest on both offense and defense.

In the second half, the Steelers
Sf‘Ol‘Cd on a pass from Ray Wolfe to
John Parsons. The Steelers played
fine ball .icamst the "Club." Bob
Drehci‘ and Chuck Derwin were the
standouts for the Steelers through-
out the $1110.

Aerial Attack Popular

Both teams seemed to prefer the
aerial attack, Although EEP had a
slight advantage over the Steelers
in the running attack. they seemed
satisﬁed to use the unerring arm of.
John Morrissey to collect their
touchdowns.

The Steelers defense worked well
on the groqu and in the air. but
they also relied on Ray Wolfe and
Bob Drehcr to do the chucking. In
the opinion of most observers, this
game was one of the ﬁnest played
on Dorm Field this season.
