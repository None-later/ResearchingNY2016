“When you lure an athlete to a
college or university for any other
reason than education. you have
introduced the element of corrup-
tion.”

Talk about glaring mistakes. next
time you're poring through the Ex-
change, note page two of the Octo-
ber 30 issue of the McGill Daily,
newspaper of McGill University,
Montreal, Canada. Under the head-
line, “Through the US. Election" is
a picture of Ike and one of Steven-
son. The caption .below Ike’s pic-
ture reads “Democrat” and under
Stevenson's, that's right, "Republi-
can.”

From the University of Detroit
Varsity News: All his girl friend does
is talk diamonds and look at more

diamonds. she’s the type with rocks
in her head

The housing shortage at Michigan
State has its compensations. One of
the dorms is now housing students
of both sexes. Oidtime students say
“they neve: had it so goon."

A South Dakota State College Co-
ed tells of her experience during
registration. It seems things were
going smoothly until she arbitrarily
chose to Join one of two equally
long lines. After a two hour wait,
she reached—the men's washroom.

FIRST SUCH REPORT EVER PUBLISHED

A responsible consulting organization has
reported the results of a continuing study by a
competent medical specialist and his staff on the
effects of smoking Chesterfield cigarettes.

A group of people from various walks of life
was organized to smoke only Chesterfields. For six
months this group of men and women smoked their
normal amount of Chesterfields— 10 to 40 a day.
45% of the group have smoked Chesterfields con-
tinually from one to thirty years for an average of

and at the end of the six-

months period each smoker was given a thorough

medical specialist and his assistants. The exam-
ination covered the sinuses as well as the nose,

ears and throat.

The medical specialist, after a thorough exam-
ination of every member of the group, stated:
“It is my opinion that the ears, nose, throat and
accessory organs of all participating subjects ex-
amined by me were not adversely affected in the

six-months period by smoking the cigarettes

provided."

Penniless Blues Annual Commuters Club Soc-Hopi

Will Take Place In Page Hall Gym

To Leave State

Are you penniless? Do you
go 'round slngin’ those I've-
nothin’-but-holes-in-my-pockets
Blues? Did you ever think of
(excuse the expression) workin’
for :1 “Vin”!

The bulletin board in Draper
that you usually walk quickly
by, has notifications of a job
for YOU, experienced or inex-
perienced.

Do you like gardening? In
this weather, you can always
burn leaves. If you’re proficient
in bookmaking. there are lots
of openings for you. And if
you're one of those rare people
who likes kids. there are loads
of baby sitting positions. If
you're a brain, you can even tu-
tor. All these are guaranteed to
pay in good U. S. cash.

Don't try to get out of it.
"l‘ain’t so bad, really. And after
all, you have only 34 more shop-
ping days in which to make
some Christmas money.

Bloch, Frank, Purcell Selections

Page Hail Auditorium will be
transformed into a concert hall
Friday night. November 21, when
Music Council presents their an-
nual Faculty Concert. The recital
will feature Dr. Charles F. Stokes,
Professor of Music, Mrs. Margaret
A. Stokes and Karl A. B. Peterson.
Instructor in Music.

The program will include the A
Major Sonata for violin and piano
by Cesar Franck. This sonata ap-
pears on the program this year by
request. It is the first repetition of
a work in this series of programs
since the inception of the series in
1044. The sonata is characterized by
many unorthodox characteristics
that are dominant in its four move-
ments. Franck's chromaticism and
use of the cyclic form to give cohe-
rence to the work are examples.

Dr. Stokes will perform the violin
part with Mrs. Stokes playing the
piano. The violin that Dr. Stokes
will use is a 1780 Antonio Testore,
and is listed in the catalogs of
liaiian instruments.

Also on the program are five se-
lections by Henry Purcell, to be
sung by Mr. Peterson. A bass-bari-
tone. Mr. Peterson studied at the
Juillmrd Institute of Musical Art
and Columbia University. During
his study at Columbia, he was a
member of the University Male
Quartet and was soloist with the
Columbia Choir. Latcr, he directed
the choir.
