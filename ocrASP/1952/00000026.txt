To the Edtor:

Recently charges have appeared in
the Common-Stater Column that
Forum was politically biased. With
the heat of the campaign over, I
think a sensible reply is necessary.

Being Speaker of Forum last year.
and maintaining an interest in it
this year. I can personally state
that there is not one iota of politi-
cal bias in Forum. I cite as exam-
ple that its general meetings have
sponsored Democrat as well as Re-
publican speakers. The two Forum
bulletin boards were equally divxd-
ed between the two parties for cam-
paign data. Also, the Soapbox neith-
cr directly nor indirectly endorsed
any candidates. It reported the news
—accurately. Where is the bias?
Answer that!

It is clearly apparent that the
writer for the Common Stater was
either ignorant of the facts and thus
drew an ignorant conclusion. or else
that knowing the facts she deliber-
ately stated a falsehood. Either of
the above mistakes are a cardinal
em in newspaper reporting. and are
most damaging to the reputation
at the State College News.

A public apology or explanation
is mandatory.

Glen N. Armitage, Grad

Co-managers of hockey, 20 Ann
Laurie and Marilyn Wittschen,
have picked a team to go on a. play-
day at Green Mountain Junior Col-
lege in Vermont tomorrow. Besides

told stand-bys, Edie Titterton, Buz-

aie and Marilyn Burke, Donna
Hughes, and Aliki Apostilides, they
have selected Edna Standley. Bea
Englehart (a frosh), Lorraine Voe-
pel, Joan Burguere (another fresh-
man). and Ann Vigilante.

To turn to another sport, last
Wednesday night’s volleyball games
proved to be exciting. fast-moving,
and skillfully played matches. The
first contest between Chi Sig and
Pierce B got off to a slow start. but
picked up considerably in tempo as
the game progressed.

Kay Oberst stood out as the star
of the winning Chi Sig team with
her long, powerful serve, especially
notable in a slight girl. On the other
side of the net. Anna Wong, play-
ing for Pierce, scored a goodly num-
ber of points with an unusual one.-
handed volley.

Beta Zeta and Kappa Delta play-
ed a spirited game that was a real
pleasure to watch. BZ’s reliables.
Marge Liddell, Angle Kavanaugh.
and Gladys Smith led their team
to two fairly easy victories.

Two teams composed mostly of
freshmen, Brubacher and Pierce A,
faced each other for the third game
of the evening. We thought that
this match was the best played of
the three. because of the long vol-
leys and tricky, close-to-the-net re-
turns. Pierce took the first two
games; the first. 13-3, and the sec-
ond. 8-7.

Hathaway Cuts
Varsity;JV Team
Remains intact

Coach Merlin Hathaway has made
the Varsity Basketball cut and is in
the process of working his eleven-
man squad into shape for a possible
opening game November 25 against
the Alumni. Hathaway has been
drilling the team on plays in an
attempt to develop teamwork and
coordination among the players.

Varsity Experienced

The Varsity is made up of seven
returnees from last year's team and
four newcomers. Those who have
had at least a year's experience on
the State Varsity are Captain Bob
Tabor, Walker. McDonald, Prout.
Allassio, Centre. and Zongrone. The
new members, Krug. Gillespie, Tel-
fer, and LaRoe, have all had plenty
of experience on other teams and
furnish rebounding- power to the
State team.

J.V. To Be Cut

There are still about fifteen can-
didates out for the Junior Varsity
team. Hathaway will probably post
the JV cut list next week. This
team will be composed of twelve
men. including about six or seven
frosh. Many veterans of last year’s
Junior Varsity are returning to fight
for their positions. Smith, DeMi-
chlell, McKay, Sage. and Combs
have the experience of a year's play
to give them an advantage over the
fresh candidates.

Contrary to a statement in last
week’s News. Joe Garcia is not
coaching the J.V.'s. Hathaway, as-
sisted by John McCormick ’54, is
coaching them.

tie and the K-Bobbles dropped to
third place in the B League stand-
ings in the action at the Rice Bowl-
ing Alleys on Tuesday afternoon.

APA had little trouble in extend-
ing their unbeaten skein as they
rolled over the Rousers 2207-1886.
Ken Rutley and Bob Sinkeldam

tory over Kappa Beta. Summit
House, who has yet to gain a win,
forfeited to Van Derzee.

Summit House Withdraws

Tuesday, after the forfeit. Sum-
mit House withdrew from the lea—
gue. Bowling manager Ralph Moot
'54, announced that since no team
can be formed at this late date, a
meeting would be held early next
week to decide what to do about
the points won from Summit by
Van Dei'zee. Thurlow and the Rous-
c.s. It is thought that the points
garnered by these three teams will
be deducted from their total and
the rest of the League A season will
be played out with only five teams.

match, Wilson and McCormick
helped the Misfits eke out a win
over the Commuters 2057-2024.
Shumanski's 505 Is High Triple

Tom Shumanski rolled the high
triple for the week with 505 and
Carmen Corsi was right behind with
501. Carrall Judd and Ken Rutley
had the high singles with 203 and
198 respectively.

Thus far this season, Joe Duran

A thrilling 3-0 victory by State
over Geneseo broug‘r‘. down he
curtain on tilt: soccer season for
this year and added to the already
impressive record compiled by the
Feds. In winning Stiltc notched
their sixth victory of the season.
and fifth straight at home, as
against only four defeats. The ma-
jor part of the offense and defense
were supplied by only two men.
Goalie Telfer posted his third
shutout of the campaign. while Al
Cannon, repeating George Wood's
feat of the previous week, booted
home all three of State's goals.

Garcia Moulds Winning Team.
Under Joe Garcia's great coach-
ing, State continued their yearly
rise as a soccer power. This year's
record alone is an improvement.
Also Coach Garcia was forced to
start the current season minus five
of last year's front line men. But
Garcia came up with some new tal-

ent to balance the veterans remain-
ing from last year and by mid—
scason had moulded a winning
squad.

Freshmen Add Strength
Jack Hughes, a freshman. filled
one of the fullback posnions very

cupubly and was a key mun in
State's defense all year. Little
"Rebel" Hockmuth, another i'rosh,

took over a position on State‘s front
line and sparked them on offense
throughout the year. until injured
in the Union contest. Don Snyder,
also a fresh. filled in as a front line
reserve and many times he proved
to form n winning combination.
Henry Niulig and Gerry Murray,
freshmen, and Don Canoniru, Soph-
omore, didn‘t see much action this
year. but gained the experience
which will benefit them in win-
ning u starting berth next your.
Cannon Leading Scorer

Stale hooters scored if total of 23

League Games

APA gained entrance to the 1M
football finals last Thursday by
squeezing out a 7 to 6 victory over
KB. The game was a hard-fought
battle all the way. In the first pe-
riod APA took a 7-0 lead as Bob
Hausner scored from the five-yard
line on a quarterback sneak. and
then passed to Fox for the extra
point.

Early in the second half, Abel
Blattman hit Bob Sturm with a spot
pass in the end zone for six points.
The attempt for the extra point was
blocked and the rest of the game
was played around the mid-field
stere, as neither team could start
another scoring drive. KB was the
first team to score on the fine APA
defense all season.

APA, EEP Play Scoreless Tie

Again on Monday the scoreless tie
“bug” hit the 1M football loop. APA
and Potter Club battled to a score-
less deadlock in what should have
been the final game of the year
Neither team could dent the de-
fense of the other. The forward
walls of each team played terrific
games, while the highy-touted back-
field combinations looked harmless.
Both APA and EEP had scoring op-
portunities but neither could capit-

~ alize on them.

Schaertle, Carlo. and Egert play-
ed standout football for Potter.
while Bennett, Lucas, and Stan-
ford sparked the Alpha Pi Alpha
eleven. Potter Club sorely missed
the services of their two fine back-
field men, Morrissey and Champ-
lin. Champlin has missed the last
few games with a bag leg, while
Morrissey. the club's ace passer.
sustained an injured wrist in the
Potter-Steelers semi-final playoff.
Final Game Set For Nov. 17

James Fox '54, announced that
the final game will be played on
Monday, November 17, at 4 p.m.
Fox asks that the participating
teams be ready to play at 4 sharp.
so the game can be completed be-
fore dark.
