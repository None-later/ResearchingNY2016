To the Editor:

I am the individual who wrote
the so called slanderous remarks
about Forum in the COMMON
STATER. Soapbox arrived at their
conclusion by maintaining that
there are 1301 students in our stu-
dent body. The Registrar reports
that the enrollmtnt for 1952-53 is
1606 students including the grads
and special students. Here is where,
I believe, our misunderstanding lies,
for I agree with the Registrar. Ap-
parently, Soapbox disregarded the
votes of transfers. grads, and all
those who do not have assembly
seats.

The above letter states that equal
space was given to both parties. I
noticed that Mr. Stephenson's pic-
ture (one that was noticeable from
more than a two feet distance) went
up on October 2'7 and vanished the
next day. Regardless of the fact
that a student may have removed
this poster, Forum, being “politic-
ally unbiased" should have replaced
it immediately.

In conclusion, I feel that the
statements I made in the COMMON
STATER still stand in that they
were arrived at through careful
consideration and truth. Therefore,
I do not feel that I drew an ignor-
ant conclusion and above all I did
not deliberately state any false-
hood.

I realize the privilege I have by
writing this column and express-
ing opinions and because of this
opportunity, I have never enter-
tained for a moment any thoughts
of untruths. When I do, I feel I
should no longer be placed in such
a position.
