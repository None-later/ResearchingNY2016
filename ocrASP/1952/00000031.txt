Civil Service
To Give Tests

The final date for filing applica-
tions for the New York State Civil
Service Commission’s college series
of examinations for Seniors and
college graduates has been extended
ten days until Monday, December
15, Commission President J. Edward
Conway said today. It is expected

that about 600 State jobs will be
filled through the tests to be held

January 10.
Starting salaries for successful

candidates will range from $2,931
to $3,731 for different types of

jobs. The following fields are in- - - -

cluded in the series exams: engin-
eering or architecture, biology, che-
mistry, library science, law, psycho-

logy, mathematics, economics, stat- - I -

istics, accounting and employment
interviewing. One year public ad-
ministration internships, paying
$3,541, are also to be filled through
the examinations.

The Commission reports that
since the college series was initiated
in 1948, more than 1,000 college
graduates have been appointed to
entrance-level professional and
technical positions.

Application blanks and additional
information concerning the 1953
college series of exams may be ob-
tained by writing to the State De-
partment of Civil Service, State Of-
fice Building. Albany.

tween businessmen and students
was increased to an overflowing
point, which provides bigger and
better opportunities for future clin-
ics.” So states Bernard Swartzman.
one of the State College students
who attended this year's first Mer-
chandising Clinic.

The clinic, whose theme was
“Solving Present Problems in Retail
Store Operation,’.’ took place Mon-
day through Friday, November 10
through 14. Among the speakers
who lectured were: James E. Lind,
from the Albany Public Market;
Mrs. Edith F. Hayter, of W. M.
Whitney and 00.; Walter Kaufman
of Muhlfelder’s, Solomon’s and the
Linen Closet; Charles Wheeler of
Whitney’s and S. L. Wright of Wal-
green's Drug Store.

The value of the clinic can prob-
ably be best summed up by some

of the comments of students who
attended the lectures. For example,
Margaret Ruck had this to say
concerning Mr. Kaufman’s talk:”
(it) was most interesting . . .
He let the class direct much of the
discussion . . . He made the sub-
ject of window display come to life
much more than extensive
reading on this subject might
have.“ Gladys Smith: “The pro-
gram was a great success, and the
students gained a great deal of
knowledge about the operations of
stores.”

'Ann Williams commenting on Mr.
Lind's talk: “. . . His pictures illus-
trating the various phases of the
business were very helpful in giv-
ing us an idea of just what the
market is like and how it’s set up.
I think the merchandising clinic
was a success and would like to see
it continue." Other students ex-
pressed the desire of seeing the
clinic not only continue, but ex-

144 14861-91

By ABEL BLATTMAN

 

There are a few heartening ob-
servations we can make, even after
the decidedly lackadaisical stint

. turned in by the Varsity last Tues-

day against the Alumni. In our

-hiunb1e opinion, these guys are a

top notch aggregation. Potentially
and theoretically they have all the
qualities of a first rate team.

The squad displayed drive, speed,
ball-handling ability, and spots of
fincsse.- Only one thing was lack-
in}, and that was spirit. If the guys
get a little of it into their play
they will have everything, and be
real tough. it is a shame that the
first game the team plays is the
roughest, but maybe it will jolt the
guys into a little life. We hope so.

The game also served to illus-
trate another sore spot. Good teams
are at a decided disadvantage on a
small court, and our team looked a
little cramped. It appears to us that
the guys want to run, and can, if
given the room, but the confines of
Page Hall slow them down some-
what. As far as this matter is con-
cerned, all we can do is cross our
fingers and hope that maybe, some
day, in the not too distant future,
we'll have better facilities.

The good showing of the Alumni
in Tuesday's game can be largely
attributed to two former State Var-
sity players by the name of Bob.
Messrs. Hausncr and Brown led the
Grad attack, the former exhibiting
a pair of twinkle toes ihat we never
before noticed. and the latter dis-
playing all the qualites that helped
make him the basketball legend he
has become at this institution.

The IM hoop leagues are off to
a flying start, and so for our only
comment is on the beitcr than av-
erage officiating. If this calibre of
officiating is kept up it‘ll be one
less gripe in the school. Of course,
it would help if the assigned teams
would supply the officials necessary.

We would like to take this oppor-
tunity to predict great things for
the Varsity Basketball team this
season, and wish them luck towards
this end.

Potter Beats APA
For Football Crown

The IM football league finally
closed Sunday. October 25, as Pot-
ter handed APA a 14 to 0 defeat.

In the opening minutes of play,
Paul Ward crashed over center to
nab Bob I-Inusner behind the APA
goal line for a safety. Later in the
tillllt‘ period. Jolm MorriSsey flicked
a jump pass to Frank Fay for a six
I:o'.n.nr.

In the second half. APA started
a drive, but it stalled before they
could score. Potter then knuckled
Conn and marched downl’leld into
pav dirt. Pat Carlo slanted off
’ii”l<‘e for the i.ouclulo\'.'n. This was
the final Ially of the game.

Peds Open Basketball Season

Jour’iiey “To Maritime Tonight

 

By DOTTIE MEHAN

 

Last night’s games marked the of-
ficial end of the competitive volley-
ball season. Next week the play-offs
will be held to determine the
champion team. In retrospect, we'd
like to say that the season on a
whole was only fairly successful in
so far as it fulfilled the purposes of
WAA and the league games. The
failure. we feel lies on the should-
ers of two groups of participants;
first, some of the individual teams
who lacked the necessary initiative
and interest to show up with a full
team. These teams were in a defin-
ite minority since most of the
squads showed spirit and enthusi-
asm. Also, in our opinion, the ref-
creeing left a little to be desired in
some instances. We wished that the
refs had been a lot more familiar
with volleyball rules, and, too, that
they had made accurate decisions
for special cases more quickly.

Perhaps in response to an article
that appeared fairly recently on
the sports' page of the State Col-
lege News, WAA has decided to give
co-ed swimming 9. trial period of
two or three weeks next semester.
This is a step in the right direction!

Bowling and basketball competi»
tions will replace volleyball for the
winter season. With typical optim-
ism. we look forward to these. hop-
ing they will be successful.

intramural Basketball Season Opens

The Intramural basketball season
got off to a good start last Monday
night as thrcc games were played in
the Page Hall Gym. Lynn Lewis and
Walt Rehder, (to-managers of the
IM League, have divided the nine-
teen teams into ihc A, B, and C
leagues. with three games being
played in each league every week.
Since the gym is available only
Monday and Wednesday nights and
Saturday mornings. each team can
play only one game per week.

Varsity Again
Victorious In
Annual Event-

By BOB ASHFIELD

Sporting nothing more than a
numerical 77-55 victory over the
die-hard alumni. all seven of them.
State College’s latest array of bas-
ketball talent will lift the lid on
the current hoop season tonight
when they engage Maritime Acad-
emy in New York. The Maritime
squad will be far from any push-
over, as they are probably one of
State's roughtest opponents on this
year’s schedule. Last year the Feds
suffered two losses at their hands,
which means the squad will have to
improve considerably over Tuesday
night's showing to post a victory.
Alumni Outplay Varsitymen

The Alumni game switched this
year from a pre-Thanksgiving event
generally gives the State College
rooters some idea of what all those
strenuous weeks of practice have
developed. This year the Alumni
made the fans wish they weren’t
such as they outplayed State’s Var-
sity for nearly three quarters, and
finally had to succumb due to fati—
gue. not because they were out-
played.
Squad Tightens Up Under Pressure

The starting five and those that
followed for State appeared very
cocky and over-confident in the in-
itial minutes of play, and as a re-
sult, no one was thinking or playing
smart basketball. But a sudden
surge by the Alumni capped by Doc
Hoyt's long one hander at the end
of the first quarter seemed to alert
the squad to the necessity of play-
ing some basketball "by the book."
It was at this point when a little
pressure was felt that nearly every-
one of State's eleven man squad, all
veterans of rugged competition.
tightened up before the friendly
Alumni. The second quarter found
the Alumni pacingr the field and
sparked individually by last year's
captain, Bob Brown and Bob Haus-
ncl'. Halftime found the Alumni
still leading by a 31-30 margin.

The third period was a continua-
tion of the first half that is until
conditioning became a factor and
thereby prevented the Alumni from
taking further advantage of State's
periodic defensive lapses. It was at
this point that the Varsity men be-
gun to attain a little superiority at
least in the scoring column and
which they seemed intent on wid-
enlng.
