is to take place on the level of con-
s.ructive criticism.

Council voted to suspend discus-
sion on the proposed Student Facili-
ties Board budget until such time
as the status of the Board and its
relation to SA can be more defin-
itely established, its policies invest-
igated. and Student Union Board’s
role in the fund determined. The
motion was passed by unanimous
vote since it was felt that SA is
unsure of the Board’s established
purpose. control, and policy.

The Christmas Sing for the as-
sembly has been scheduled for De-
cember 12, while the Athletic
Board’s report on football has been
tentatively set for the same date.
The Rivalry Sing, formerly post-
poned, has been set for February 27.

7 STATE COLLEGE KIWI.

and MM" 070%“

 

Last Tuesday evening the Advanc—
ed Dramatics class presented its
iourth set of plays.

The first play, a college satire,
was directed by Richard Jacobson,
and at this time we would like to
congratulate the director on his
fresh choice of cast. It is with great
r-rlde and pleasure that we welcome
Harry Mills back to the State Col-
lege stage, and we hope to see more
of his talents. Newcomers Jim Con-
way, Dick Woods. Owen Smith and
Stu Macnofsky might possibly have
done better with a better script or
more adequate directing. In our
opinion the whole production was
mediocre—mediocre in sets, acting
and script, with some highlights as
sound-effects.

Considering the type of the sec-
ond play and the usual reception
of such by State College audiences,
we can say that Miss Wiles deserves
credit for a production that grad-
ually took hold of the audience and
had them well in hand by the end
of the play. The technical aspects
were largely responsible for this.
Miss Hopkins did an outstanding
job with some tendencies toward

1..

   

overacting her role. Miss Ciliberti.
although on stage a short time.
added life to the heavy surround-
ings. We should like to acknowledge
Mr. Lubliner’s role and hope that
he will appear again on our stage.
Mr. Orser’s performance was pale
despite his well~assumed haughti-
ness. The ending left us with the
feeling that plays such as this do
have a place at State College.

Co-op Spark
Christmas List

Is your Christmas list list-
less? Does it sag in the wrong
places? Then what you need is
a little Co-op-eration.

Downstairs at the State Col-
lege Co-op you can find the
necessary gift items for every-
one on that bit of paper you’ve
been trying to hide from all
those prying eyes. For Mom
there are informative magazines
that no mother would consider
being without. such as “Hunting
and Fishing," and “Baseball Di-
gest." Anyone’s father would be
glad to have one of those stuffed
dogs to call his own. The com-
pacts available would certainly
come in handy on little brother's
next date. unen he wants to
make sure his face is on right.

Do you have a spcclal some-
one overstas, girls? The Co-op
has packages of Hershey bars
conveniently boxed for mailing
“over there." And. if you want
him to come back safe, be sure
to 5 nd a box of “life-savers."

Council Sponsors
Group’s Return
To Page Stage

The General Platoff Don Cossack
Chorus and Dancers, under the di-
rection of N. Kostrukoff. will ap-
pear at Page Hall Monday night at
8:30 p. m., under the sponsorship
'of Music Council.

During the thirteen year history
of the Chorus it has performed
over 5,575 concerts. Many of these
concerts have been of a religious
nature. while others have been for
the U. S. 0., both in the United
States and in the Far East.

Make Second Appearance

The Don Cossacks last appearance
at State College was in 1947.
The reception which they received
here prompted one of the members
to say that the Chorus preferred
college audiences to any other type
of audience.

Cossacks Visit Various Countries

The leather-booted entertainers
have visited sixty—five different
countries during their tours and
have given concerts in such famous
places as the Cathedral of Notre
Dame in Paris and Carnegie Hall in
New York. The chorus has seen the
Eli‘er Tower the Parliament Build-
ing in London. the Pyramids of
Egypt and the holy places of Jeru-
salem. Wild beasts of South Africa.
.earthquukes in Chili. and revolu-
tions in Brazil are no strangers to
the Cossacks.

But the Don Cossacks are not just
adventurers. they are highly skilled
entertainers. The New York Times
has said that the Chorus “still
stands among the best choral groups
.now to be heard in our concert
halls." 'l‘hc Boston Post has said.
“When they stump onto the stage
in perfect formation with their, mil-
itary bearing and bright uniforms
you get your first impulse to cheer
and your second one when they be-
gin to sing.”

Admission By Student ’l‘nx

Admission is by Student Tax or
$1.50 for Reserved Section or $1.00
General Admission. For an evening
ol‘ musicul entertainment. Music
COllll(il invites the general public
us well as the student body and the
