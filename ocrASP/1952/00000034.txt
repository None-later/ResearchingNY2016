144 14363 It

By ABEL BLATTMAN

 

Today the Athletic Association
will culminate a year of intelligent
research when it presents Its report
on the feasibility of Inter~collegiate
football at State College. This re-
port has been in the form of a rec-
ommendation to the administration,
and will be accompanied by either
the stamp of approval or disap-
proval.

That a decision of this nature
should rest with the administration,
namely Dr. Evan R. Collins, is both
fitting and ptopcr. and we are sure
that it will he arrived at only after
very careful consideration.

We feel that our student body is
the equivalent of other such groups
in this country. Our intellect, as a
group, is not that much higher,
that anyone can say we are not a
normal college group. The school
spirit in this institution is not en-
tirer lacking. it is merely at a.
stage of development. To say that
it can never be developed better is
to say that we are not a normal
collegiate group. and that we feel
that such a viewpoint is ridiculous.

We honestly feel that should Dr.
Collins veto football at State 1
would not be on these grounds.
There are ample grounds for a tem-
porary delay of building an Inter-
Collcgiate football squad at State.
The coaching staff would have to be
augmented somewhat, especially in
view of the fact that at present it
is opcrat'ng at a virtually full load.
This would have to be done through
the great god State. and hence
would take time. A workable insur-
ance set-up would have to be fortn-
ed. since our Varsity athletics are
not covered through a stbool policy.

r.

Should the decision b) based on
these two points. we would WllOlC-
hcartcdly agree with it. The prob-
lem then. as we see it, would be to
iron out those details. a task which
ccrta nly would not be too difficult
for our administration and student
body to perform.

The twelve teams signed up to
participate in the bowling competi-
tion met at Rice’s yesterday for the
first competition. According to Pa-
tricia Theobald. one of the co-
managers of bowling. there was a.
warm-up session last week. A new
handicap system in to be initiated
in State’s bowling this year. The
individual members of a team will
establish an average for themselves
over a period of time and a team
handicap will be determined from
this. Pat hopes that this new sys-
tem will “make bowling more com-
petitive". As a co-manager with
Elaine Strykcr. she is very enthu-
siastic about the degree of interest
shown at this titne.

Only one volleyball game was
played this Tuesday, and that 9.
110.610ch- i’rom Saturday when there
wasn't enough titnc to finish the
scheduled slate. We'd like to say
that the officiating Tuesday was
commendable.

Next Tuesday, two teams unde-
feated in their respective leagues
will meet for a play-off game. A
real fast team from Brubacher A
will face a comparable team of
Phi Delt girls. We'll go ’way out on
a limb, and predict a victory for
Brubachcr on the basis of their
consistently good playing.

State Trounces ,
Oswego 82-72
For First: Win

Tonight on the Page hardwoods,
the Feds will be gunning for vic-
tory number 2 on the season when
they engage the Harpur Colonials.
Also at stake tonight will be an
eight game win compiled by the
Feds over the last two years on
Page. Harper was one at State‘s
victims when they invaded from
the Triple City area last year, but
took revenge by taking a one point
victory over the boys from State
before their fans. Tomorrow the
Statesman will take to the road
again. this time In quest of a vic-
tory over New Paltz. Last year the
Feds took a 67-45 decision from
New Paltz there and concluded the
season with an easy 73-48 victory
on Page.

Statesmcn Conquer Oswago

Last Saturday night the Oswego
visitors found the statesmen were
too good an outfit to be conquered
by them as they absorbed an 82-72
setback. The men from State didn't
show any signs of being tired after
playing the previous night in New
York, where they dropped a 57-50
decision. Instead they battered the
good showing they made there and
came through with the type of play
that. has been predicted for them
from p re-season observation.
Against Oswego they ran up a quick
lead which resulted from the utili-
zation of practiced plays and accur—
ate shooting. This lead was grad-
ually diminished and State led at
half time by a 37-35 edge.

Walker. Allasio Top Scorers

In the second half Bill Walker
anti John Allasio gave the fans an
idea of how a couple of outside men
can score. Walker was getting that
extra step on his defensive man and
driving by him for those two point-
ers. Allasio, on the other hand, was
hitting with his famed deadly
right hnnder of his from the side.
Walker tallied 19 points for the
points for the night. while Allasio
accounted for 17 before fouling out.
Nels LaRoe. a newcomer to State
this year, helped himself along the
way to becoming a mainstay on
the squad with his work under the
boards while also posing as a scor-
ing threat by tallying on some neat
plays. Captain Tabor. as against
Maritime didn‘t seem to get going
until the second half, but when he
did, he grabbed his share of re-
bouuds and tossed in seine timely
baskets. Bud Prout continued his
great backeourt play by exhibiting
n deadly sctshot If given time and
an alert driver if given the room.
Each man portrayed individual tal-
ent, but what counted was how they
combined it for team play.

Stale played a winning brand of
ball against the Maritime Marines
but the first game "jitters" again
seemed to grip the Statesman as
they only took a total of 50 shots
for the night. Their floor play was
above that. of Maritime, but thcv
couldn‘t argue with a height advan-
tage. ’l‘abor paced the Feds with 12
markers.
