Versatile Box
Goes Berserk

A box. a box. my kingdom for
a box. This is a box. Journal-
listically. a box is short. perky
and of interest to all. This is
short.

A box is also a reeeptiele for
things. dead things. This is a
preburial box in commemora-
tion of all who left this world
to struggle with the brutalities
of other worlds (exams). They
have. courage. Let us hope that
their efforts will not have been
in vain.

A box is also defined as a
blow. mortal or otherwise. This
is not that kind of a box, we
hope.

In baseball. a box is where the
pitcher stands. Such a position
may be dangerous to the pitch-
er. Tliis box has a few such
characteristics.

This is a news box. This is a
box? Give me a horse any day!

 

Hershey Defines
Changes In Law
On Dratt Status

lnforinatioii concerning student
enlistments in the service after the
end of their academic year has been
reica:ed by Major General Lewis B.
i-lers'hey, Director of Selective Serv-
ice. General Hershey explained that
as a result of the 1951 amendman
to the Selective Service law stu—
dents are henceforth to be deterred
instead of having their induction
postponed. This procedure will give
students the opportunity to enlist
in the service of their choice.

The new law provides for the dc«
ferment of students. who have been
ordered for induction but who have
never been deferred before as a
student. to the end of the academic
year. In addition the law gives the
Prisident authority to prescribe
regulations governing deferment of
students in such numbers as he
deems necessary. The President pre-
scril'ezl a second student deferment
program. Students may be placed
in this ClllSSlfl‘titit)“ of 11-8 at the
discretion of their local boards. At
pr cnt students who are in the
. ' d upper portion of the male
members of their class or who made
a score of ’70 or better on the Select-
ICmitinucd on Page 1:. Column 5)
