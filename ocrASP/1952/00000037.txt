STAT. COLLIGI NIWS. FRIDAY. JANUARY 11. 1952

 

 

Exam Schedule . . .

Since the announcements of various examinations
in classes by the faculty, the schedule for the ex-
amination period has been changed. The schedule
which has been’arranged now is almost comparable
to the ones followed previously at this institution.

As originally scheduled in the catalog of the
college, examinations were to begin Thursday, Janit-
ary 24 and terminate Monday, February 4. Sec-
ond semester classes were to be resumed the fol-
lowing day after the closing of the examination
period.

Unless the schedule had been changed Seniors
and other students taking conflict examinations
would have had to return to classes the following
day. Also, the Seniors scheduled for second semester
practice teaching would have been taking examina-
tions during the same period in which they were
attending teaching conferences. The period between
the conllict day and the resumption of classes will
now provide for this.

During the past, examinations usually began on
Saturday and continued for a ten day period with
conflict (lay falling on Wednesday. This year in
order to provide time for students to prepare for
examinations the test period will begin on a Mon-
day instead of a Saturday, the day following the
closing of classes for the semester. Due to this
change. conflict (lay falls one day later and thereby
shortens the vacation period one day. The new
schedule will also enable students in doubt of
passing courses to secure their marks by leaving
a self—addressed post card. noting the course con-
cerned. in the Registrar's Office.

With the examinations scheduled three days earl-
ier. no course will miss more than two recitation
periods. At the most. oiin one-half of the courses
in the college are missing two classes. lf examina-
tions were to begin on the ’l‘hursday following the
final class session. as was originally planned, it is
doubtful that the Wednesday class meeting would
be of value.

Why Change?

Today in assembly a discussion will he held co
cerning the changing of the college letter from the
present  to an "A" I'Iariy in the year. tiic
Varsity (‘iub requested a clarification as to the
official letter for the college. This year the soc-
cer uniforms had an  on them.

Since the request for a change in the letter. :ir»
guments have centered around such things as an
increase in college spirit and more tactfuiness as
far as the other State 'l‘cachcrs Colleges are con-
cerned.

Actually are any of the arguments valid? Some
students feel that since we are not the only coi-
iege which is a state school. we should refrain
from using an  and use an  as the official
college letter. it was however noted at the l(‘:\
conference this year that we are not the only
school which calls itself "State." We are. lion'—
ever. the only school which has the official title of
New York State (‘oilcgc for 'l‘cachcrs. Let's iiol
destroy the prestige of the school by changing
insignificant traditions as far as SA is concerned.
Let's leave the letter as it was originally established
for this college and spend our assembly time in a
more worthwhile manner by discussing other im-
portant busincss regarding SA.

There has been a lot of discus-
sion lately in this space and else-
where. about what the college stu-
dents of the present generation are
doing with themselves. It has been
said that we are wasting our time
and creative energy on things which
either are no concern of ours. or
are so trivial as to be beneath our
notice. This criticism has come
from those older than we and from
our own ranks as well. Do we de‘
serve it?

a book which some of you may have
read. The title is "The Catcher in
the Rye". by J. D. Salinger. it i.

ALL OVER THE PLACE

Committees! A new committeel Conference Investi-
gation Committee. It seems that Council iceis that
State contributes to but receives little out of ICA con-
ference. Evidently it isn't necessary for us to attend.

academic gathering not designed tor social or extra-
curricular activities but mtliiy people ioel that we
need not attend an academic conierence . . thus.
the new and important group, the Conference in.

idea or any other kinds of committees be sure and
get in touch With Student Council.

()NE SUGGESTION . . .

however received from the ICA conference was an
investigation of health insurance each school is 1-0-
ceiving‘ and an attempt for all the colleges who are
members of ICA to obtain the cheapest insurance
