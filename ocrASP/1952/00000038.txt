It seems that the University of
Tennessee has a gripe about time
They feel that the system of cam-
pusing late coeds is a bit stiff, and
it does seem stiffer than ours. At
Tennessee ﬁve minutes late means
one campus; 15 minutes late means
a week's campus.

Ofﬁce clerks at Otterbein College
in Ohio had their little fling. Invi-
tations to attend High School Day
were sent to Barney Google. Jane
Russell, and Gypsy Rose Lee.

Now here’s a brilliant idea! The
University of Miami has establish-
ed a new organization called the
Cabbage Patch. The purpose is to
give ﬁve dollar loans to students in
distress. These loans must be paid
in 14 days. and five cents a day is
charged for overtime.

“On your guard! Touche!" Such
are the pass words on German cam-
puses where dueling has become a
common practice, and the scarred
cheek is a mark of honor. Fraternity
men have been ordered by their
alumni ofﬁcers to practice dueling
once a week to prepare for pos-
sible challenges.

Debating at the University of To-
ronto has taken a facetitious. po-
litical turn. In their debate at West
Point they took the afﬁrmative of
the topic: ‘Resolved: that the Unit-
ed States should become a part of
Canada."

By DON BURNS

 

In the near future a proposal will
be brought before the student Body
to OK plans for the adoption of
a Varsity Track Team. This action
is long over due in a money-minded
College such as ours. This Inter—
collegiate Sport. which embraces
more contestants than any other.
is managed at very low expense. The
variety and keen Individual com-
petition of the cinder game draws
among the top five spectator sports
and alloyvs the small schools to
compete. and win. with all comers.

The material for a good squad is
here in the College right now. as
the rare Rivalry meet reveals once
a year.

Give this plan your full support
and the team will give you a suc-
cessful season in 1953. It's tip to the
undcrclassmcn to carry this
through. If you want a bigger and
better sports program at bargain
prices here's the chance. 'l‘hcr'c's
about $6.000 in surplus. Are we go~
ing to leave that for the (loss of
2003‘?

While in the vein of bargain
sci‘killg. may I sugesi to you ski
enthusiasts that you sharpen up
your pens in an effort to secure the
free skiing week end offered in the
story near the bottom of the page!

Here's another good buy. and it
has a double return. On January
14. at the RP! Field House. the
l'niicd States Olympic llm-kcy
team will play the Engineer Pucks—
tcrs in a game that will benefit the
Olympic Winter Game Funds. The
Olympians are on ll current twelvr
game exhibition tour to seek funds
for dei'ruying the expenses of their
team as well as that of the Bob-
slczl tcam for the Winter Games
in ()slow. Norway. The liobslcd learn
has already been forced to drop
three men. which endangers the
IRS. chances of retaining the title
won in ISIAIB. You won't see better
Iio'kcy in this area. so let's get
over there and support this game
and have il good time to boot.

Outcome Will Be Huge Factor
In Determining League Cup Victory

With the resumption of league
activity in the Intra-Mural hoop
league after the holiday layoff. a
total of only four of the eighteen
league teams remain undefeated.
This total will be reduced even fur-
ther by games which undoubtedly
will be a huge factor In the determ-
ination of the winner of the champ-
ionship cup.

Only Kappa Beta, Potter Club.
Kappa Delta Rho and the Finks
have unblemished records with five
wins apiece. Saturday. Kappa Beta
will meet the Finks, and on Monday.
Potter will face Kappa Delta Rho.
Potter Tips

In action Wednesday night, thr
Pottermen garnered their fifth win
by downing Sigma Larnda Sigma
46-22. Pete Telfer led his mates to
the win with a total of twelve mark-
ers and A1 Kaehn gained runnerup
honors with 10. The usually high-
scoring John Stephenson was held
to a mere '7 points which may in-
jure his chances to stay among the
leaders for high scoring honors.

The same night the Beavers
dumped the Ocelots of Sayles Hall
39-19. High for the victors was Jim
Warden who hooped 13 and high
for the Oselots was John Smith with
five hoops for a total of 10 points.

Upsets Mark The

Intramural Bowling

Finks Ousted From First;
Adams Hits High Trpile

The Rice Bowling Alley was the
scene of some very fine consistent
bowling Tuesday. with the majority
of games running true to form.

The one major upset was scored
by the celler—dwellin 4—1 boys over
the Finks. The victors led by the
line bowling of Joe Lombardi. Al‘t
Golden. and Carroll Judd were in
danger all through the match but
came through in the tight spots to
take three games to their opponents
one. High men for the losers were
Bob Lanni, and Bob Jucoby.

This upset. coupled with some
fine bowling on the part of Chern—
oi'i‘ and Wilson was all that thc
Misfits needed to move into first
place in the upstairs league. The
Misfits found little opposition in
the Commuters. except for Charley
Lusk's 456 Triple.

The big game In the Downstairs
League saw the Potter Grads con-
tinue along their winning ways as
they defeated the second place Bea-
vers. Better than 400 triples by the
entire EEPP squad of Kachii. Weih-
crby, Teller, Warden. and Juisio

. were too much for the fine scores

i‘iippcd out by Deniers iind chiucss
of the losers.

The other two games in this cir-
cuit ended in forfeits, with Sigma
Lambda Sigma and Kuppu Beiu
getting the nod over ilic Ruin Burns
and KDR respectively.

’lhc afternoon hiin of 642 was
rolled by Ralph Adams as he raised
his lcuguc lending triple for the sea-
son by 98 pins to 642. Ralph is also
leading the league with u 184 aver-
age. If Adams continues his cur»
rcui "Iloi" spree Iic will sci till all-
time high for IM ui‘ci'ugcs.

The Clowns set back the Panty-
waists 54-43 in the only other game
of the evening. Each hooping 14
points Bill Dunn, Bill Taylor. and
Ronnie Ganslow tied for" scoring
honors. Dunn led the wini.:rs While
the Ganslow-Taylor total was not
enough to thwart the Clown efforts.

After a slow start, Kappa Delta
Rho came back strong and trounced
the men from Thurlow Hall 58-31
on the Page Hall Court Monday
night. Jim ‘F‘lash" Fox gained all
scoring honors in the setee by
chalking up 23 points to keep his
game average at 20 points. Fox re-
mains among the top five scorers
in the league. For the Thurlowites,
Ben Button and John Eldridge each
added 8 but it wasn’t enough to
stop the undeafeated KDR quintet.
Buchanan Sets Season Record

Chet Buchanan set a new sea-
son‘s scoring record for a single
game and led the Angels to a win
as they downed the Fakers 64-35.
Buchanan threw in 34 points to ac-
count for more than half of his
team score. Murray Zweben adan
11 for the Angels while Arnie Smith
garnered 17 for the losers.

Monday's third game didn't come
off as a result of the Communteri
forfeit to the Knicks.

Three games were played on Sat-
urday, the Finks fifth consecutive
win being outstanding. Playing
without the high-scoring services of
Tom Yole the Flnks blasted the
Redskins 48-30. Frank Fay dunked
in 10 to lead the winners while Mil-
an Kirchnlak was him for the 105-
ers with 9. High scoring Joe Per-
sicc was held to 4 points by the
winner's defensive manuevers.

\ ’arden‘s 21 Leads Beavers

The Beavers were victorious again
on Saturday as Jim Warden led the
team to victory over the Vagabonds.
Warden hit the nets for 21 and
starred on defense. The combined
efforts of John Parsons and Kay
Finley were not enough as they
hooped l4 and 12. resnectlvelv. D'"
Lein and Tom Muelleii were de-
fensive standouts for the Van Der—
zce five.

In the final game of the week
the Suyles Hull Trotters came out
on the long end of a 54-44 game
against the Clowns. Scoring was
evenly distributed between John
Sponable who was high with in
Dave Penny with 14 and George
Schnertl who hooped 11.

Ted Strauss Takes Title
Fourth Consecutive Year

For the fourth consecutive year.
Ted Strauss. Grad, won the S.C.'I‘.

ircd the title by beating Al Brown
