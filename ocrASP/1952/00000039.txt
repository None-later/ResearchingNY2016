Anna Apostolides was the first to
tell us she had already broken he:-
resolution. “I guess I really didn't
believe in mine," she said with a
laugh that was far from regretful.
“I broke mine the second day of
school,” declared Fran Hopkins. “I
intended to go to the library in-
stead of the Commons. It doesn‘t
work." Flo Friedman made a typi-
cal resolution. to get enough sleep.
“I’ve already broken it. Brubacher's
so close, you know."

Fran Schatzle was completely
honest. “I didn't make any resolu-
tions because I'm good enough with
out them."

Vickie Baldino frankly admitted
that she hadn't made any resolu-
tion. but said that she had reformed,
nevertheless. "I get up half an hour

At this point we resolved to scur-

Law Prescribes
Deierment Rules

r Continued from Page 1, Column 2)
ive Service College Qualification
Test may be considered by their
local board for deferment. However.
local boards are not required to de-
fer men who meet one or both of
the criteria.

If students who meet one or both
of the criteria are not deferred, they
have a right to appeal to their local
boards. General Hershey reminds
students. Those who wish to do so
should write to their local boards
ten days from the date the local
board mails the notice that they
have been placed in Class 1—A.

Although the Selective Service
law allows a man to enlist at any
time until ordered to report for iii-
duction, General Hershey explained.
the Ai'my, Navy, and Air Force in
July 1950, agreed not to acept any
man for enlistment in any of the
services after he has been notiﬁed
to report for his Selective Service
pro-induction physical examination.
Since June 1951. the Department of
Defense extended the period until
March 31. 1952, increasing the pro—
bability of a choice in January or
June 1952.

Dr. William S. Carlson, formerly
President of the University of Ver-
mont, has been appointed President
of the State University of New York.
He succeeds Dr. Alvin C. Enrich,
who resigned September 1, and will
assume his duties April 1. Announce-
ment of the appointment was made
by Dr. Oliver Carmichael. Chairman
of the Board of Trustees of the Uni-
versity.

As President of the State Uni-
versity. Dr. Carlson will head an
educational system of twenty-two
schools and colleges and eleven two-
ycar technical institutes. The insti-
tutions have enrollments totaling
33.000 full-time and 14,000 part—time

The new chief executive of the
State University was graduated from

The University 01' Idaho

nated blood and the University

be quite an honor to win with
the present urgent need for

We can't let Idaho beat the

ject just because he is asked his
opinion."

Dr. Carlson is on record as being
opposed to commercialized college
football. In December of 1948, in a
speech before the Midde Atantic
States Collegiate Athletic Confer-
ence in Philadelphia, he declared
that college football was a possible
“Frankenstein m on s t e r which
threatened to obliterate the aims of
the college itself.”

The announcement of Dr. Carl-
son‘s resignation from his former
position at the Vermont University
came as a surprise even to members
of the University‘s Board of Trus—
tees. In the New York Times one
trustee is quoted as saying that “Dr.
Carlson‘s departure would be a
great loss to the University of Ver-
mont and to the state." while an—
other expressed the feeling that he
was "much let down by the news."

When he takes over as head of
thirty-three schools on April 1, Dr.
Carlson will become the second
president of the State University of
New York since its founding. His
predecessor. first president of the
University, resigned September 1 of
this year in order to assume the
position of vice-president of the
Ford Foundation for the Advance-
ment of Education. Upon Dr. Eu-
rich‘s resignation, Charles Garside.
air active member of the Board of
Trustees. was appointed Acting
President. He has continued in this
rapacity until Dr. Carlson's appoint—
ment.

Varsity Players
Will Encounter
Oswego, Potsdam

Hathawaymen Average
64.8 Points Per Game

Seeking to extend their current
win streak to five straight, the State
College Varsity Basketball squad will
journey to the North Country to
vie with Oswego and Potsdam to-
night and tomorrow night respect-
ively.

Riding high on the crest of three
stunning victories, over Pratt, Mari-
time, and Plattsburgh. by 15, 23,
and 17 points, the Pods will face a
powerful Oswego quintet led by a
crew of fledglings. The “Profs” from
Oswego will be out to avenge last
year‘s squecker when Killer Kaehn
dropped in a one-hander in the last
three seconds to end the “Profs”
win streak by a 51-50 count. Oswego
is one of the five squads on State's
slate that is only met once each
year alternating home and away.
State Favorites in Potsdam Tilt

On Saturday, the Statesman
should find the going a little easier.
as they meet Potsdam on the lat-
ters‘ court. The North Country team
will be strengthened by the return
of lanky 6' 4" Van Orman who is a
seasoned veteran and ire will be sup-
ported by a bustling aggregation.
Last year on the Page hardwoods.
Bob Brown and Bill Walker corn-
bined to mesh 34 points between
them for the locals. as the Peds
romped 89-68. The Dutchmen will
be out to avenge this loss, but will
be facing a powerful Purple and
Gold squad that has averaged 64.8
poiirts per game, while holding the
opposition to 62.4 per game.

The Hathiiwaymen. although siz-
zling hot iii their last three outings.
have had a three week abstinence
from intercollegiate competition and
might. have a little of the luster re-
moved i'rorn their otherwise sparkl-
ing attack. The team features a fast
break and has been doing better
than average work on defense. If the
defense improves in any measurable
degree, the Pods should fare well in
the remaining 10 games. six oi‘
which are on the road. At the sea-
son lurlfwny mark, the squad boasts
11 .600 won-lost percentage.

The probable starting lineup for
tonight‘s game will be Brown. Walk-
