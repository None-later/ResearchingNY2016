PACE 1

it's Your School

Every year at the beginning of the second se-
mester students become lackadaisical about the
appearance of their school. From recent observa-
tions of the cafeteria, the commons and the bul-,
ietin boards it appears that nobody seems to care.

This year with the moving of the commons next
to the cafeteria, it has become more difficult to
keep both places clean. Obviously the cafeteria is
not large enough to accommodate the students of
the college. Therefore, the only alternative is to
look for a seat in the commons with a bottle of
milk and sandwich at the midday rush. Those in-
dividuals who are not fortunate enough to obtain
a seat in either the cafeteria or the commons must
resort to the hallway outside the commons.

The rules of campus Commission definitely
state that there is not to be any eating in the com—
mons. Perhaps it is better that one break the rule
and sit down for lunch. However, this does not
mean that students should leave milk and coke bot-
tles around the commons to be spilled on some-
one's clothes (which has been the case many times
this year.) If rules are being violated, students
should take care of their materials. The fact that
it is difficult to find a seat for lunch in an at-
tempt to make a twelve-thirty class does not mean
that papers and milk bottles should be strewu in
the hallway outside the commons. At the present
time there is no receptacle in this area for students
to discard waste paper. Perhaps such an instal-
ment would help in alleviating the situaiton.

The commons this year certainly has atmosphere
but the question is whether it is a desirous atmos—
phere. Certainly, cigarette butts on the floor-do
not give it a respectable appearance. Keep in mind
thatrthe students of the college should cooperate
with the janitorial staff in helping to keep the
school clean. Many visitors travel through our
hallways everyday. The school can be as clean as
we want it to be. it's time that somebody cared.

Money Again . . .

Today in assembly members of the bowling
team will request $1.58 from Student Association
in order to participate in the New York State
Bowling Tournament at Kingston. Last year the
team requested $150 in order to participate in the
same tournament. With the result of their suc-
cess the members were able to turn over to the
Student Association surplus a sum of approximate-
1y $525. The members of the bowling team are
risking for a reasonable sum oi money and it should
be granted to them this year. Perhaps in the fu-
ture if this bowling contest is to remain an annual
affair at State College (although it is not entire-
ly limited to college participation), it would be
wiser to include the sum in the regular athletic
association budget instead of sending a special
request to assembly every year.

 

We wish to extend our deepest sympathy to
the family of lh'. Ralph (i. Clausen. who died
January l-i. 1052 at the Albany Hospital. New
Scotland .\vcnuc. llr. (‘iauscn came to State
('ollegc in 1033 and served as Chairman of the
iliology department until i:‘chruary, 1050 when
he resigned. His inspiring lectures and his line
sense oi humor will long be remembered by the
students oi State ('olicgc.

By CHARLIE GRUNEISEN

.._—__——_

 

All hail, Progress. Goddess of
Change, and all her Progressive
Children. Twenty-five years can do
a lot, ’52, even to old State College.
Way back then, when you old sen-
iors faded away, this was just a.
little school: a bit provincial, a bit
slow to change, and a bit hesitant
to realize the good in a change for
a change's sake. But now we’re a
big school, ’52. Changes have come
furious and fast. (Note the inver-
sion of a tritism, which marks me
the master of style all English ma-
jors should be.)

Ten years ago, our old foster
father, the Legislature. broke down
and bought us a football team, its
equipment. and even built a stadium
for us (the internationally-known
Fish Bowl) in the middle of Wash-
ington Park Lake. Coach Merlin
says that, once the difficulties in
the Major-Minor Social Calendar
are worked out, the team can be
expected to win their first game
against Delmar Central Grammar
School.

And what School Spirit weve got!
You’d hardly believe it. I know. You
used to be all split up into groups
called classes (silly designation) and
wasted all your spirit that way. But
now weve got an expanded Educa-
tion schedule that has expanded
our official program to seven years
(the Liberal Arts people wouldn't
have it otherwise) and the way we
take in freshmen makes failure a
normal, heartwarming adventure,
rather than a source of frustration.
So now, no one knows where he
stands until some November morn—
ing. when the Registrar mails his
last June's diploma to hlin. and
we're not worried with that silly

old closis spirit. Just listen to our
cheerleaders,

“Rah, rah rah! Ray, ray, rayt

We've gotta team that’ll win to-

day!

Stayte College, Stayte College,

5, 6, buzz, 8, 91"

No. the school has developed, and
our catalog shows it. Adding and
subtracting are taught on the grad-
uate level, for those who don’t learn
them in the modern elementary
school. Officiating in Tiddly-Winks
is a required course for first-year
men. and the language requirement
has been entirely dropped: you
don‘t even have to know English!
(except for Alphabet 202).

We've got the whole of Draper
for a Commons, with private dens
and the like. The sharks play
hearts, and a few mediocre souls
try their luck at Fan-Tan. but by
and large the game is now War, a
highly intellectual. and strategic
(extended metaphor, see?) card
game.

If there was 21 Cult of Youth in
your day. you had to do the pam—
pering. Remember how you couldn‘t
flunk us little darlings? And we of
State College today, have come to
realize our place in this grand
structure. At the age of 28. our
average graduate is the most culti-
vated, most pampered youth in our
whole youthful society. He is too
old physically to start over. too
young mentally to change. He will
indeed make the most congenial of
all congenialitics before a class.

Yes. '52, there is much good in a
change for its own sake. You and
those about you couldn't see it. so
we have stolen your future from
you. but I'll bet you wish you had
it all to do over again. don‘t you?

LAST FULL MEASURE

In case you hadn‘t heard, the University of Idaho
managed to get 1/3 of its student body to donate
blood and they have issued a challenge to all other
colleges to try to beat that mark. Anybody with a
surplus will have a chance to “spout” as soon as
the campaign gets under way when we hope to have
a mobile unit at the school. Some of us won't have
a chance because they won’t accept anything over
90 proof.

P. s. If yours is over 90 proof. we have a VCl‘y close
friends who can use a gallon or so. It’s gonna be a.
cold winter!

GOOD MOVE

Wednesday night at Student Council a very pointed
motion was brought up to change the constitution
to take the nominations of SA songleader out of the
class meetings and put them into SA assembly. A
good idea in view of the “log-rolling” and “rail-
i'oading” that went on at a recent class meeting con—
cerning these nominations.

Under the present system, the poor attendance at.
class meetings makes it possible for small groups
to eliminate everyone except the one they want.
from the election.

HIT PARADE

Any budding songwriters keep your eyes peeled for
a contest for a new Alma Mater which might be
brewing in the near future. We are trying to con-
tact Johnny Ray to audition your entries?!

HATS OFF

To the administration for looking out for our wel-
fare and moving exams up. We think the faculty
also did a fine job coordinating their work on such
short notice.

VARSITY CLUB

has come up with what we consider a terrific idea.
They are going to ask everybody to “donate” a twen-
ty—flve cent admission at the next basketball game
and whatever they collect will be given to the polio
fund. All the other colleges in the vicinity have done
it and have been successful and we think State
should get on the bandwagon since none of our
money from Campus Chest went to polio this year.

Good attendance at the game will boost both the
fund and the team-—-Soe you there!

 

 

THIS WEEK

TKA. a national honorary forensic fraternity, will
be installed at State. The chapter was brought here
through the efforts of Mrs. Carino and our (icbators.

THE BIG DAY

of graduation has finally been set for Sunday

Council Sponsors State Fair To Take Sporty Twist

With Lady Wrestler, Gambling

By CATHERINE LYNCH

Hey! Hey! Over here folks! See
the strongest ladies in the world
wrestle. Listen to the screams and
groans—they are only limbering up!
These ladies are just a. few of the
newer attractions at State Fair Feb-
ruary 16. says Francis Hodge '53
head barker. _

The opening act, to be put on by
our faculty, is a very novel produc-
tion according to rumor. They are
keeping it a big dark secret.

Popcorn palaces will sell that
standard fair product to those who
like to eat as they stroll down the
gay. colorful midway. A genuine
wesrern cafe has been opened to
provide cool ice cream.

If your tastes run along the line
of sports, you can try your hand at
darts or even miniature golf. Be
careful of loaded golfballs! The
darts. too, may possibly be mag-
netically attracted to something
other than the board. Organiza-
tions have tried to make their busi-
nesses as much like those at real
‘airs as possible even to the stand-
ard gambling device, the roulette
wheel.

Student Misery
Finds Company

Have you used up a full sem-
ester‘s cuts looking for lost
classes? Have you frosh gain
tripped into a classroom only to
find lecture-weary graduate stu—
dents there? Have you spent
half the period listening to a
physics lecture before you rea-
lized it wasn't a lit class ?

Consolations if you still have-
n‘t found the right class—con-
grats if you have.

There are students who ar-
rive at the right classes on time.
Bedrag‘gled. foot - weary stu-
dents, who‘ve checked the regis-
trar‘s office. every bulletin
board. and searched for notes
tacked on doors. What price
glory? What reward for dili-
genee‘.’

As you shyly poke your head
into the classroom. the beaming.
upturned faces of those who
have suffered and overcome it
all will greet you. Ah yes. What
better reward than company in
misery?

College Offers

who go to fairs only to enjoy them-
selves or to win odd prizes, there
are little turtles ﬂoating in water
with numbers on their stomachs. If
you happen to pick the right num-
ber maybe you’ll win a mink coat.
As many of you have discovered
from unfortunate experiences, hor-
or shows are not for those who are
faint of heart. Take it from one
who knows. oh you of little courage,
stay away from booths which ad-
vertise mystery, thrills and adven-
ture.

Wrestlers. sports, prizes. and hor-
or shows are not the only intrigues
at State Fair. Night clubs offer al-
luring ﬂoor shows variety spectacles
provide amusing entertainment. You
can even go to a circus or view an
old time movie.

S u p p o s e something important
comes into your mind. you can have
it recorded for posterity on a tape
recorder. If the thought is meant
for someone in particular send him
a telegram. Blanks may be obtained
with no difﬁculty.

Seriously speaking all your nickels
and dimes go into a fund to be
used to bring a foreign student to
our campus. Won‘t he learn some
strange things if he ever sees State
Fair?
