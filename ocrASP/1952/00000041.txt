KD Beats Beta Zeta;
Feature WAA Contest

Pierce A Tops
Phi Delta 14-13

Handicapped by the loss of two
key players, Evie Kampke and Mary
Marks, the Beta Zeta girls were

vanquished by snappy KD. Kappa

Delta girls, in the latter part of the
season, seem to have found the
basket in their pace as they have
been defeating some of the best
teams in the league.

Th excellent passwork of the
team and the outstanding guard-
ing by Betty Platt of fleet-footed
Nella Bertin, aided the Green and
White in maintaining the lead
throughout the entire contest with
BZ never threatening.

BZ worked the ball around the
outer rim of the court well, but
could not work it close enought
to get to the basket for favorable
shots.

“Hot Shot" Joan Pearson lead
Kappa Delta with ten points as she
hooped them in from all angles.
Mary Pugsley and Joan Stopielo
were outstanding for The Maroon
and Grey.

Pierce A Wins Again

In the second contest, Pierce A
continued their winning streak by
downing a fast Phi Delta team in
a close game 14-13. The "Picrccitcs"
who were behind throughout the
entire contest, rallied in the last
few minutes as Anna Apostolides
sank in the foul shot that meant
the game, Both Apostolides and
Joan Haggerty lead their team with
six points.

Brubachcr E and F Units rolled
over Chi Sigma Theta in a onc-
sidcd contcst 20-11. For the victors,
“Iggic” Komunowski led with six-
tccn points.

In the final contest, Gamma Kap—
pa Phi very costly downed the Left-
overs by the Sl‘fll't' of 28-8.

The remaining games of the SOIL;-
ou promise many cxcitinr. .‘lorc
games as tho tcums, unlike 1115'
semester. are now composed of only
one league.
