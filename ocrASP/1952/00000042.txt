‘I'I’A'I'l COLLIGI NIW‘. FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 3. 1952

 

Paola; 00m 7/” gee/range

 

An intellectual at the University
of Illinois has decided that current
cheers should be revised. His plans
include these changes:

“Get on the ball—Obtain the ob-
late sphere.

Hold the line—Impede the foe’s
forward thrust along the two di-
mensional entity.

Go team go—Proceed, oh valiant,
proceed, hey!"

Harvardites have found a new
proﬁt making ocupation: brewing.
Students involved have denied sell-
ing their product, and claim that no
illness has resulted from drinking
the stuff.

A history professor at the Uni-
versity of Hawaii went through a
whole lecture complete with jokes,
and wondered why the class didn't
pay attention. No wonder. He had
repeated the lecture of the prevrous
day.

A new book entitled “Going
Places" has been published by some
enterprising Yale students. The pur-
pose of the book is to help men
date college women on “a sounder.
smoother basis." Twenty women's

     
   

colleges are discussed in detail with
inclusion of the following: maps of
each campus, important telephone
numbers, and information about
curfews. Hmm!

Careful, this could happen to you!
A freshman at the University of
Colorado "cracked up" as a result of
too much studying. He robbed a cab
driver, stole the cab, got chased by
the cops. crashed the cab into a
curb, got shot in the leg by police.
and to top it all, was arrested.

Commission Reiterates
Violated Campus Rules

Campus Commission would like to
call the attention of State College
students to several of the Campus
Commission rules. Kathleen Ryan
5‘2, Grand Marshal, has announced.
Two rules are being broken fre-
quently.

It is against the rules to smoke
in the corridors and classrooms. Al-
so, the cafeteria, not the Commons.

Faculty, Students
imbibe Together

They've got an awful lot of
coffee in Brazil, but not as
much as they had in the Lower
Lounge 01’ Brubachcr l-lall dur-
ing the Sunday afternoon Cof-
fee Hour.

A glance around the Lounge
revealed that the usual tidyncss
was cplaced by coffee cup upon
coffee cup. Of course, a few
loyal Britishcrs stuck to their
tea bags. There were also lots
of cookies within easy reach,
that is. if you once lived in a
boarding house.

Amid pleasant conversation
and precarious balancing of
cups, the food was quickly ab-
sorbed by the faculty and tiic
students. The cloud of smoke
did not interfere with the good
fellowship that prevaded the
atmosphere.

The very near future will see
an encore of this successful so-
cial affair. Everyone had a good
time, including us.
