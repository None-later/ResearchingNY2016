Real Brotherhood?

Beginning next Sunday the yearly Brotherhood
Week will be proclaimed throughout the entire
United States. In the past this week, which is sup-
posedly for the purpose of encouraging the prac-
tice of brotherhood, has often been criticiezd. In-
dividuals seem to feel that the entire year should
be spent in practicing brotherhood. Nobody will
deny this fact. However, it is doubtful that there is
much harm done by proclaiming one week in the
year as “brotherhood week.” Certainly, it does
bring to the attention of citizens of the United
States that we are hoping to build a brotherly na-
tion. Perhaps we can say that Brotherhood Week
is at least a start.

Here at State College we have Inter-Group
Council which is helpful in furthering the
understanding of prejudices and the ideal of com-
pletely erasing them. We cannot erase prejudice
against religious and racial groups by merely
studying it, although it is a start. College
students rarely will admit at this institution that
they are prejudiced against certain minority groups
simply because today “it isn’t the thing to be
prejudiced here." We deny our true feelings. Per-
haps one of the most and best solutions as far as
ethnocentrism is concerned is the awakening of
our individual minds. Let’s question ourselves why
are we prejudiced? And better yet, let‘s spend
some time with the people that we are prejudiced
against in order that we may have a more com-
plete and better undrstanding of minority groups.
Brotherhood can and will mean something to you
then.

Sports League?

As a result of the recent lCA Conference it looks
like the students of the colleges of the State l'ni-
versity of New York are beginning to realize that
they are a part of a big university. Hampered by
the lack of a single campus, it is difficult for the
member schools to really accomplish anything.

This year l’lattsburgh has sent a poll
around to the various colleges requesting their

particular opinions on the setting up of a bas-
ketball league to be composed of the State Teach-
er Colleges in New York State. Since Brockport
and Cortland prepare physical education majors
and undoubtedly are out of the class of the other
teachers colleges, as far as athletics are concerned,
there is a question concerning their willingness
to join the proposed league. 7
The poll which l’lattsburgh distributed request-
ed information as to whether we would like to be-

come a part of the league, and whether there
should be an eastern and western division. The
league might also include all inter-collegiate

sports. Student Council went on record \\'cdnes-
day night favoring such a league. it does not mean
that State College has joined or that the league
has been formed. Council seemed to favor
both an eastern and western division since trips
out to the westrcii part of the state might result
in greater expenses. We could still play the Col—
leges in the western part of the state which Wt‘
now play (although it would mean non-league
games.)

it appears as if this might be a wise move on
the part of the State 'l‘eachers Colleges. Such a
league, if it is formed. will undoubtedly help in
publicizing the State l'nivci'sity of New h'ork . . .
it‘s lime that more people realize that it exists.

Seems as if everybody’s got a
gripe. It just doesn't figure—at
least as far as I’m concerned.
Monday. somebody opened a win-
dow in the Commons and, much
to their surprise, it fell off. On
Tuesday I bought a sandwich in
the cafeteria and it turned out to
be delicious. Next day the wind
blew and four teachers turned up
missing. So what else is new?

Darn it all anyway. let's face
it. the old place sure enough has
more than its share of deficien-
cies. Only thing is none of us have
very much of a right to squawk
Today we're here. tomorrow who
knows. and just like Mr. L. said—-
the world will little or long give
a hoot.

'Course who practices what they
preach. Unless I keep my tongue

carefully stuffed in my month
where it belongs. I find myself
tearing into something or other.

Then on those rare occasions when
I try to do a little thinking, it
kinda. hits me in the bolo. Every-
body‘s always got a gripe.

I know I ain't much. but I‘m
happy. Oh yes, there are a lot of
things I’d like to be. and a lot of
places I'd like to see. Never before
has there been so much music to
hear. Literally thousands of bean-
tiful things to look at. Yet. you can
take care of most of that by your-
self.

What's my complaint? It's all
okch for people, especially young—
er ones, to be somewhat dissatis—
fied mid want things bigger and
betterwthat‘st progress. Suppose.
though, that State was a dream

off, special students supervised the
supervisors. In choosing your sehe~
dule you had to flip coins to pick
one fascinating course out of a
whole list of fascinating courses.
How long would it take for a new
bunch of kids to think up a whole
new set of groans and cabillations’?

I don't know—the old place ain'i
so bad. What if the education de-
partment is worthy; it gives Soph-
omores and Juniors a chance to
do back homework and crossword
puzzles. not to mention keeping up
on the latest gossip. Eagcrncss on
the part of the students to be im-
pleasantly caustic isn't going to
accomplish anything. Readiness, on
the other hand, of the embryonic
pcdagogues to make the best out
of what little may be there is much
more apt to demonstrate the com—
pelling need for a drastic change.
Everyone seems too eager to shoot
Sandy Claus just because he's got
moths in his beard

Be that as it may. I do have a
sort of suggestion that I'd like to
offer in all sincerity and humility.
One thing I'd like to see replace a
large share of the complaining is
ii more well rounded interest in
both high and low brow intellect.
Let's look a trifle more closely after
the giif'f'iiws are finished. Don‘t
give up the funny sheets entirely.

around, Everything has a ccrtuin
capacity to generate liilt‘l'f‘stw

Cezanne to Charles Adams, women

ing and give it a try, huh?

Spooks Dorken
P O Doorway

ls Brubacher "all haunted?
Ar: spooks running rampant
through the. halls? While every—
one was busily typing his news
stories Tuesday night, the Pub—
lications Office was suddenly
plunged into obscurity.

A few courageous souls ran
toward the door in an attempt
to catch the culprit who had
extinguished the lights. But no
one appeared to be near the
switch. ()ne building electrician
fumbled with the fixture until
he hit upon the right combina-
tion.

With a slight flickering, the
room returned to its former
brillianey. but not for long. The
mysterious trick was repeated
spasmotlically throughout the
evening.

Is there a Sherlock Holmes or
a Dick Tracy in the. student
body who would dare to accept
this case? He who undertakes
the task should heed this warn-
ing—beware of batteries.
