Council Stresses Curiosity Leads Inquiring Reporter
Blood Donations To Interview Bewiidered'HOpetuls’

Brotherhood Week will be inau-
gurated in the United States and
in many foreign countries Sunday.
This year the observance will be
focused on the need for donating
civilian blood to the armed forces.

The fundamental purposes of the
week are the enlistment of more
people in year-round activities to
build brotherhood, a rededication
of each person to the ideals of re-
spect for people and human rights,
and the demonstration of practical
things people can do to promote
these ideals.

Brotherhood Week, sponsored by
the National Conference of Chris-
tians and Jews, was established in
1934 at the suggestion of Monsig-
nor Hugh McMenamin, a priest of
Denver, Colorado. Since then, the
President of the United States has
served as honorary chairman of the
United States observance. Eric
Johnston is serving as General
Chairman this year. Brotherhood
Week 1952 will be observed in more
than 6,000 towns and cities in the

United States and in many cities,

of Canada and Europe, according
to the sponsoring group.

Dear Breezy,

Well, they say curiosity killed the
cat, and I sure got clobbered the
other day when curiosity sent me
through the halls of lower Draper.
On my way to Ed, I decided to take
a peek at the “hopefuls” of ’56. I
was really beginning to find the trip
worthwhile when you, you doll of a
feature editor, came charging up
and gave me the opportunity I had
been looking for.

"Interview!" you screamed. “Find
out what they think of us!" You
would have said more, but in a
flash I was off.

I stopped short before three of
these bewildered youngsters who
were quietly speculating on the pos-
sibility that Minerva was States
first Dean of Women. I hastened to

Group Holds
Study Session

Tuesday there will be a meeting
of the science study group of the
Capital Area School Development
Association, according to the chair-
man of the group, Dr. Carleton
Moose, Supervisor of Science in the
Milne School. The meeting will be—
gin at 10 a. m. in Richardson Hall.

The CASDA group consists of
teachers from several schools in the
Capital Area and the Mohawk Val-
ley. They will study and discuss va-
rious problems connected Wth the
teaching of science courses in the
junior and senior high schools, ac-
cording to Dr. Moose.

QWWM

To the Editor:

We hate to blast a usually hard-
working and intelligent group like
the Student Board of Finance, but
they finally outdid themselves.
Seems that the Varsity Club wanted
to make a benefit game out of the
State-Willie game to be played
Monday night. The plan of the Var-
sity Club was to more or less re-
quest a “donation” of 25c as an
admission charge at the door. The
money thus collected, plus the profit
realized by the sale of refreshments
was all to be turned over to the
Knick-News Polio Benefit. Not only
would this have been serving an
excellent charity but also would
have resulted in about a week of
free newspaper publicity for our
athletic department. However, the
Student Board of Finance decided
that putting a sort of moral obliga-
tion on students attending this
game to contribute a quarter, was
unfair since student tax had already
paid for the game and sug-
gesccd that passing the hat for do-
nations would be sufficient. Since
this is an impractical and non-
lucrative way of collecting money,
and since the title benefit game
could not be attached to the ensu-
ing contest. the whole excellent idea
was quashed.

We might add that Student Coun-
cil was for the idcii (unofficially)
but there is u faction on Council
that Wlls wholeheartedly against
the plan. This faction is the one
that never attends any games any-
way. thn the lllltLLCi‘ was brought
before the Student Board of Fin-
ance it sccms that ii fcw on the
Board were of the sonic opinion and
thus insisted that Varsity Club be
restricted in its collection munncr.

It‘s time that such people rcullzul
that in gaining uthlctic prestige.
State Collcgc as it whole bcncfns,
and that to blindly fight such pro-
gress menus to hurt our institution.

To the Editor:

Last week an editorial appeared
in the State College News which
was devoted to the unpleasant and
unhealthful condition of the Com—
mons. We congratulate the editorial
writer for his insight in bringing
this matter to the student body.

But—as in the past—when a cor-
rectable situation has been present-
ed, the students huve not taken
upon themselves the interest and
responsibility necessary to remedy
the matter.

We believe that it is the job of
every student in this college to co-
operate in keeping the Commons
from looking like a pig sty. How-
ever. it is not the role of the indivi-
dual student to provide an adequate
number of ash trays. waste rcccp-
tacles. and coke and milk bottle
cases.

Whose job is it? Docs the fault
lie in the management of the cafe-
tcrin? What is the role of the Cump—
us Commission in reference to thc
Commons?

If it is thc job of thc Campus
Commission to promotc clcanlincss
in the Connnons, why doesn‘t that
organization either do its job or
resign?

We as individuals do not have the
power to obtain the ncccssin-y ilIlO—
cation of funds to providc the im-
pleincnts of clcnnlincss. ’I‘hcrcforc.
Wc suggest to the members of Camp-
us Commission that thcy usk thc
proper authorities for the money to
provide the items we fccl ni'c nccd-
cd.

We are sure that the studan body
will show more cooperation whcn
given "something to work with."

explain that she was only the sole
survivor of Carthage.

Without further ado, I introduced
myself and according to your
teachings, began the interview at
the correct psychological moment.
The only male member of the
group, Boice Rogers from Center
Moriches, told me that he was im-
pressed by the friendliness of States-
men. (This was a common senti-
ment among all those interviewed.)
He complimented the chorus, which
he had heard practicing, and re-
marked how surprised he was that
State College wasn't the dilapidated
group of buildings he had expected.
Marianne Peckham of Cobleskill
said she had enjoyed her interview
with Mr. Sabol and liked Dr.
Greene Schenectady-ite Joan Nej-
man, after a little persuasion, de-
cided to say something good about
State. Incidentally, she revisted Dr.
Green for bruises on her arm.

The upshot of it all, Breezy, is
that somehow I found myself con-
ducting a tour through the dorms
and Student Union. At day‘s end I
removed their handcuffs and sent
them home to dream of days to
come at SCVT.

Wcll. Breezy. there you are. and
it wasn't so bad after all. It has
given me a good idea, though. I
think I'll spend more time in the
rotunda!

Once again, we find those noble
and esteemed Student Representa-
tives of ours making mockery out
of one of the few worthwhile things
that SA has attempted to put across
this year.

Varsity Club represents a good
portion of the members of SA and
they came up with what everyone
concerned with the Varsity Bas—
ketball Team and athletics in gen-
eral consider to be a fine gesture.
The basketball game with Willim-
antic Monday night. was to be
played for the benefit of the “Kid
around the Corner" and all that
was needed was the OK of Student
Board of Finance. Do you think
this calloused group of amateur
financiers could see their way clear
to put their stamp of approval on
the benefit game? No, they
couldn‘t! It seems as though the
SA budget allows all holders of a
Student Tax Ticket free admission
to all Home athletic contests, and
that is the crux of their rcjcction.

Charity for the needy was not
included in the budget last Spring
so a Benefit Game is postponed.
Where's the logic?

It seems to me that we elected
intelligent, individuals and they
should have the mental, if not emo-
tional, capacities to use some kind
of judgment in dealing with n case
like this. We all appreciate their
care in looking out for our bcnc-
fit, but how many students are
there in this college who wouldn't
be willing to donate “two bits“ us
the price of admission to scc the
varsity play. A goodly number of

those in attendance would toss a
lot more than that an"‘ y in some
gin mill afterwards.

All available plans for Monday

night's charity tilt had to bc aban-
doned for the present bccuuso of
the rush action of the Board of
Pursestrings. In order to stage 21
similar contest in the hour futurc.
the men in tho Varsity Club will
be forced to bring their plea for a
chalice to give this College a decent
name and to giyc a few hundrcd
unfortunate kids a chuncc at
hcalthful activity, before you. the
Student Body.

When this “legislative charity"
is presented. I hope that you will
be a bit more human and rational
than wcre your Clllly clcctcd coun-
terparts. As it stands now. cvcry
college in thc Capitol District urcu
has promoted u game for thc Kid
around the Corner; arc wc
chumps? Let's not (lcluy fhc pluns
any longer!

Interest Needed

In spite of numerous obstacles
which have beset him, Coach Joe
Garcia has scheduled tentative
matches for his wrestling club.

Activities have been cru‘tailed
somewhat due to lack of interest
but Garcia is hoping for a pickup
both on the part of the participants
and the spectators. Now that exams
and whatnot are over, Garcia ex-
pects more interest.

Meets for his charges have been
scheduled on a tentative basis with
Darrell Academy of New Lebanon,
New York, Albany Academy and
Van Hornseville Senior High.

According to Garcia, if a more
active interest on the part of the
participants appears evident, a
group will be selected to attend the
Amateur Athletic Union meet in
New York City.

Allliillg the more outstanding per-
formcrs to date are LeRoy Neglis,
Tom King. who has displayed much
improvement over last year, and
Walt Helm.

Practice is being held daily from
3:30 to 5:00 in the little gym.

Attempting to bounce back after
their 4-game winning streak was
snapped last Saturday night, State
will journey to Plattsburgh tonight
with hopes of starting a new win-
ning streak. The statesmen will be
favored to do Just that after the
convincing victory they registered
over Piattsburgh quintet in Page
Hall earlier in the season. Platts-
burgh has the potentialities to win
with in Bob Gai‘row and Jim Sears
11‘ they can only click. Sears didn‘t
portray 11:5 usual form in the earli-
er game, so it is expected he will
be one of the big men to stop in the
Burgh's offensive attack. Garrow has
a variety of shots and he specializes
in the hook shot with either hand.
U115 Perna, another mainstay in the
line-up, is always a dangerous mam.
Two regulars, Baldlsari and Mc-
Carthy, will not see action for
Piattsbuigh. Baldisari, the lanky
center, is still bothered by the brok-
en nose sustained in the earlier
slash in Albany. McCarthy played
the last game of his college career,
in the previous Page Hall encounter
as he was graduated from school in
January. The loss of the services of
both these men will definitely de-
tract from the team’s effectiveness,
but State will have to be on their
toes to take this one.

Saturday night State's win streak
was stopped at 4 by Potsdam, 56-47.
This was the team that should have
been easy for the squad, but their
failure to come through in the sec-
ond and fourth quarters enabled
Potsdam to gain an uphill battle.
State could only tally 6 points in
each of those two fatal quarters
which definitely spelled doom for
the Hathaway men. Potsdam picked
up the necessary points to win by
scoring 6 more field goals than
State. Sullivan, playing his first
game for Potsdam. put on a fine
showing for the home town folk
with his fine all around play. Walk-
er topped State's scoring attack with
12 points.

The previous evening was an en-
tirely different story, as the 57-52
victory recorded over the powerful
Oswcgo squad was definitely a well-
played game. State displayed the
some brand of ball that had ac-
counted for their three—game win-
ning streak. They grabbed the lead
curly in the first quarter and never
relinquished it the rest of the way.
Walker again paced State’s attack
with 17 points.
