Colleges Inaugurate New Program SA To Discuss

Since the beginning of time, man
has needed training in the art of

correctly. his teachers have been

fact that the world has been going

TV Show To Spotlight
Teaching Oi Language

“In and Out of the Classroom
with Modern Languages" is the
title of the State College television
show scheduled for this morning.
The show, which will be broadcast
over WRGB Schenectady, will dem-
onstrate techniques used in teach-
ing modern languages and will por-
tray extra-curricular activities of
interest to students of "modern
languages. The half-hour show will
begin at 11 am.

Several students are participating
in dances selected for the program.
Mrs. Charles Stokes will act as ac-
companist. The program is direct-
ed by Dr. James Childers, Profes-
sor of Modern Languages and
Frank Carrino, Instructor in Mad-
ern Languages.

 

Adam, the Ford Foundation 'has set
up a Fund for the Advancement of
Education which is seeking to cure
the worlds’ ills by starting at the
root of the situation.

Educators have arrived at a new
theory which, incidently, has been
quite prevalent on our own Campus
for a number of years. Students
spend too long learning teaching
theories and too short a period
learning what to teach. Under the
new program, which is being under-
taken by 21 colleges, students will
study the liberal arts for the regu-
lar four years. They will then go on
to a ﬁfth year of studying teaching
problems such as what to do when
“Johnny” who is a senior in high
school still has the annoying habit
of hurling erasers when properly
provoked.

The necessity—and often the fail-
ure—to interest superior students in
the ﬁeld of education has been rec-
ognized. and its suggested solution
is to make the field of education
one stimulating to the imagination.
This new educational trend should
produce a generation of citizens
with a broadened outlook on life.

“Succeed or die," the young man
was advised, as he joru'neyed from
his New England home to Albany
to undertake a novel experiment
which most people believed was
doomed to failure. David Perkins

of his young life, beginning at 19
years of age when he opened a

Then Robert Burns ‘55. made a mo-

the administration.

A motion proposed by Carlo pro-
posed that Athletic Association tax

the initiation of a football team.
This motion was tabled for further
consideration. Burns moved to es-
tablish a fact-finding committee of
smcn members from Student Asso-
ciation to talk with athletic author—
lilcs. to gather the facts and to pre-
scnt thcse facts to students in an
open mccllng.

private school. This new venture
was to be the opening of a State
Normal School at Albany for the
purpose of educating students in the
practice and theory of elementary
and secondary education. The ex-
periment began on December 18,
1844 when 29 pupils assembled and
were taught by the principal-teach-
er David Page and assistant, Pro—
fessor Perkins.

The lack of facilities was second-
ary to the force of the opposition
which had been raised against the
new school. The eloquent Page spoke
in every place which would afford
him iucinties in support of this
grtaL proJcct. But greater than his
abilities as a teacher and leader in
education was the character of
David Page. His personal mugni-
Lucie helped to raise teaching to a
rcspictu‘oic profession. It was claim-
ed that Dario Page would have at-
taincu the heights of Horace Mann

38. His death on January 1, 1848.

greatest battle for the education of
educators. n the day he died. one
of his pupils wrote her parents a
sad page in the history of State.“ Mr.
Page is no more . . . is it pOssiblc
that We shall hear no more that
rich and musicul voice as he rlscs
in his place from morning to morn-
ing to offer up prayer to God . .
my heart stiflcs with emotion as I
write." Years later, remembering
the beloved Father of State, Phelps
wrote, “He is gratefully und affec-
tionntcly remembered by thousands
who know but to love, and named
but to praise him. He was a man
whose dignity. cnmeliucss and grace
of person were so impressive as to
compel confidcncc and affection at.
first sight. He was. indeed. the ideal
type of a noble man and a perfect
teacher."

“Runaway Land,”

a romantic musical, will be pre-

sented by the Sophomore Class tomorrow at 8:30 pm. in

the Page Hail auditorium.

Margaret Eckert plays a young

girl, Barbara Pierpont, who joins a local theatre group
