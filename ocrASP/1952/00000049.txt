Hurryl Girls!
'Tempus Fugii’

If you hear strange noises in
the halls today, don’t worry.
It’s only the murmur of a battle
hymn mingled with a battle cry.

Yes, today's THE DAY, Feb-
ruary 29, that extra twenty-four
hours that nature gives us only
once every four years. Now’s
your chance to do all the things
you’ve wanted to do, like at-
tending that late claps you’ve cut
all semester, or trying out the
pogo stick Uncle Charlie gave
you for Christmas. Best oppor-
tunities can be had by the fe-
male sex, however. After all, to-
day is the day that makes leap
year. Tradition claims: fall in
love on February 29, be married
within the year.

So, go to it girls! Go to it
everyone! This is Obey That
Impulse Day. You needn’t stop
at anything. Well, almost any-
thing.

State Grapplcrs
Lose To Darrow

Motmcn Still Optimistic
Regarding Club's Fututc

Joe Garcia's musclemcn, the new-
ly organized wrestling team, held its
first match Saturday. against the
groaners froth Darrow Prep. The
victory went to Darrow 25-11. but
the State matmen expressed op-
timism considering the inexperience
of the team.

Saturday's lineup included three
veterans, King. Fuerbarh and Bliss.
with the novices Derby, Helm, Co-
hen, Lewis and Finley. King toppled
his Darrow opponent by a fall and
Bliss and f‘uerbach won by deci-
sion.

According to Garcia, the new
squad is increasing its number every
night in their 3:30-5:30 meetings in
Milne gym.

Recent additions to the group in-
clude Fran Schatzlc, a veteran of
last year's squad. and LeRoy Negus,
a frosh newcomer.

Garcia disclosed that games are
scheduled with the power-laden
team at Van Ht'n'nsev‘lllc High. and
tentatively with Albllll‘; Hi'rh and
Albany Academy teams at future
dates.

S‘mre the team members are
chosen for colrpct‘tion with outside
teams by series of weekly elimina-
tinns, the same inch do not neces-
sarily wrestle every week and there
is opportunity for wide participa-
tion. Couch Garcia expl'csscd hope
for a successful Season. and l-laimed
that he has some wonderful mu-
terinl to work with and has high
hones of arousing the interest of
more men.

STAT!

[ace-17 Spooﬁng

Dear Santa,

I guess I’m a .bit early in writing
this year and it probably will ap-
pear to be a Juvenile thing to do in
a college paper, but what I want
from you is a pretty big thing.

You see Santa. there's been quite
a bit of talk around the campus in
regard to the start of intercol-
legiate football as a part of our
athletic program. Gee. Santa. how
I wish this would become a reality.

In plain words. our athletic pro-
gram here at State, just isn't too
hot. Sure, we have baseball and
soccer and basketball and a wide
number of intramural activities, but
somehow, it just doesn't seem like
college without football. No, Santa.
I’m not trying to appear to be any
cut and dry “Joe College“ but I
would like to see more interest, on
the part of the students. in State,
raher than in individual classes.
This class interest is a good thing
I suppose. but what I'm wishing
for is a little more school spirit.

I know you'll want to question
the practicality of football here.
but it can lead to bigger and better
things. For instance, I can see the
day when we have that nice. new
ficldhouse on St. Mary's 'Park with
facilities for basketball and swim-
mine, and a huge auditorium where
the dramatics' calsses can hold
their productions. Then we‘d also
have a colorful college band and
maybe even the start of a major
in Physical Education, which would
undoubtedly strengthen the athle-
tic department. We've got the po—
tehial elements. now all we need
is the real thing.

Also, think of how much it would
aid the graduates in obtaining em-
ployment. The college would have
a “name” and names do mean a
heck of a lot these days.

Mod. neonle lcspecially in the
Albany event are under the false
impression that State is a girl‘s
school. It isn't. bv anv means. We're
not a lot of eood men on this camp-
us and all that thev heed to prove
themselves is a little push.

This football deal can be that
l)l“'ll.

So what do you say. Santa. won‘t.
vnn sec if vou can‘t brine; a foot-
lézlll program here to State? Thanks.

Sincerely.
Joe

Last vvcunesuay, the basketcers

and ms mates to the victory. Also
outstanding for the Statesmcn were

and Boo Sage with 12 markers
apiece. Coan is replacing the in-
Jured Jack rel'nandez in the start-
lllg lineup because of Fernandcz's
lllJlll‘L‘d ankle. Fernandez, who up
until the time of his injury, was
running neck and neck with De-
Michelles‘ for high scoring honors,
will probably be lost to the squad
for the remainder of the season.

Scoring honors for the evening
however. went to Bernardo of Op-
penheim who set the seasons in-
dividual-high scoring record with
a total of 31 points.

instrumental in the team's suc—
cess this season has been the mag-
mllcent loachlhg work by Joe
(intent and Pete Teller. They have
moulded the team into a fine.
coordinated outfit with the kind of
hustle and spirit that can make
any team a winner.

Lumlcy Most improved

Ulli' of the most improved play—
trs on the squad thus far has been
big Bob Comley. Lollllcy took over
the starting center reins froth Jim
Bennett, who was taken ill, and
has proceeded to really make the
spectators take notice. Comley hoop-
ed 13 points against Oheonta last
week and was topped only by De-
lVllchellcs‘ who rimmed 16.

The teams next encounter after
tonight‘s game will be on March

This time it will be the Booker T.

'54, '55ers Split
Rivalry Swim Meets

With the men of the Class of
1954 rallying after the Freshman
women had taken the first. points
of the Rivalry Swim, the Green
Gremlins have maintained a two
paint "spread". The rivalry score
now stands at 15-13 in favor of
the Class of 1955.

The Li‘osh gals got off to a fine
start as they captured the first
have events. The combination of
Donna hughes and Angie Kavan-
augh was hard to beat as they came
in first in two events, the side
stroke relay and the free style re-
lay. The three men relay saw
Hughes again come in first with
Nella BCI'tlll and Joan Hartmann,
Sophs, coming in second and third
respectively.

The men's events proved to be
a close race. In the underwater com-
petition, Boo Schuman, Frosh, went
down to defeat to Bill Statts of the
Blucjnys. However, Steve Serniak
put the Green and White back
into competition as he took the
breaststroke race. The Class of '54.
than wan on to take the next two
successive events with Norman
Koriyama being victorious ovcr Bob
Burns in the freestyle and Bob
Rivers coming out ahead of De
Combs in the backstroke.

EEP Quintet Retains
lM BB League Lead

Potter Cluo retained the IM Bas-
ketball League lead by virtue of a
46-23 win o.cr the KB aggregation

 

Monday night. Action that night
also saw two forfeits; the Vaga-
bonds gaining a victory over the

Angels and the Fihks giving a game
to the Trotters.

The Potter cause was well aided
by Harry Johnson‘s dumping in 9
points and Pete Teller, Ed Mathews.
and Don Burhs‘ swishing 8 points
apiece. For the losers Neil Ryder
dropped in 7 points. and Abe Blat-
man and Dave Wander cleared 6
points apiece.

Potter Club‘s 12th win in a row
was a rough and hard fought victory
as KB failed to score in the first
12 minutes of play. Abe Blatmah
was seriously injured in the fray
and Joe Dolah. also of KB, had to
have 3 stitches put in his chili.

State Topplcs
New Haven For

Sixth At Home

Tomorrow night State's basket-
ball squad will again takte the
road to encounter New Paltz. State
Will Be snootmg for win number 10
of the season. Last Wednesday
night m Page Halt State ran its
unbeaten string on the home court
to six straight with a win over New
Haven by a 75-69 score. A third
quarter spree by Gerry McDonald
and John Allasslon enabled State
to outlast the visitors in the final
canto. McDonald and Allassio com-
bined to score 11 points to increase
State's slender two-point lead at
halftime to a more substantial 8
point lead at the end of the quarter.
Fouling was heavy throughout the
game and it was really at the foul
line that State won the game as
they collected 25 points in this
manner as compared to 7 for New
Haven. John Centre’s 14 points was
indivdual high for State.

Unconta ’l‘ops State

Last Friday night State took its
sixth loss ol the season at the hands
of Unconta. by a score of 69-56.
State seemed unable to set its usual
pattern of play on the huge On-
eonta court and by the time they
found themselves in the second
half the 14 point halftime deficit.
was too much for the statesmen to
overcome. The boys seemed to be
getting the range early in the
game, but the shots just wouldn't
go in. Claire Jacobson, in the mean-
time, scemcd to have little trouble
with the shots he was taking. He
collected 21 points, which was high
for the night. John Centra hooped
18 in a losing cause.

State Wins At Home

Famillar Page Hall seemed to be
cure lor the Huthawaymen as they
notched a 63-54 victory over Utica
College, last Saturday night. This
victory proved sweet revenge for
the loss suffered by State earlier
in the season at the hands of the
same Utica quintet. Utica was not
at full strengh as a result of Fitz-
gerald's. being called into service.
Fitzgerald was only a freshmen and
already was the playmaker 0f the
squad. Fouling again plagued both
teams. with Utica suffering the loss
of Nichols, and Collette. the scor-
ing partners of Rudy Valenzi. Val-
enzi, who specializes in hook shots
topped Utica scorers with 14 points.
