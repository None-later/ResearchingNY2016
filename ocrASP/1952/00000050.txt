Most people today don’t seem to
know whether they are coming or
going but according to the New
York Times geography test of 5,000
students in 42 colleges, we don’t
even know where we are. For ex-
ample. when these students were
asked to name the countries border-
ing Yugoslavia, some students
named Belgium. Egypt, Manchuria,
Portugal and even Canada.

This apparent lack of knowledge
seems to predominate in other than
just the field of geography. The en-
tire personality of the college co-ed
has been attacked by a Harvard
English professor when he described
college girls as listless, pessimistic,
confused and obsessed by a fear of
the future, Howard Mumford Jones
in an article pessimistically entitled
“Have College Women Let Us
Down?" also bemoans the fact that
‘A dark, unreasonlng fear has the
college girl in its grip. This is her
fear of the future dominated by
the atom bomb." Jones accuses the
college girl of a senseless system of
copying into her notebook the notes
of her professor without ever con-
sidering the significance of the
facts. He adds, however, that possi-
bly the listlessness now evident may

   
 
 

be shadowed overnight by some
dramatic turn in history. The best
rationalization the co-ed of today
can make is this apparent fatalism
of the older generation.

On the lighter side of the college
news, the University of Buffalo
Spectrum recently printed six rea-
sons “Why I never joined a soror-
ity?” They were: One: I wanted to
do as I wished and think for my-
self instead of being led around by
a bunch of sorority sisters. Two: I
had never gone into women's clubs
and organizations before I came to
college and I didn't want to start.
Three: I had never danced with a
man in my life and I didn't want
to. Four: I didn't like the idea of
having to room with the same girl
all semester. Five: I didn't fill out
a sweater and I didn‘t look very at-
tractive in a sleeveless, low cut
gown. Six: I'm a male.

Anti here's the quote of the week
taken from the Daily Kansan. “It
is difficult to understand why the
officials in Washington recently
gave the Princess a key to the city.
After all. just a little pull will open
almost any door there." Oh well
remember to keep smiling. Next
week is National Smile Week.

To Appear On Page Holl Stage

By IRENE ELDRED

Gilbert and Sullivan will once
again reign on Page Hall stage as a
breach of promise suit is settled
equitably in “Trial By Jury” on
March 14 and 15. But before the
Royal Court takes over, the folks
of the Alabama mountains will
sing their way through the troubles
of Jennie Parsons in the modern
American folk opera “Down in the
Valley" by Kurt Weill.

In “Trial By Jury" Gilbert and
Sullivan chose to satirize a court
of law in which the trials and trib-
ulations of Angelina, the Plaintiff,
will be aired before the Learned
Judge in a nineteenth century Eng-
lish court as she sues for breach of
promise against Edwin. the Defen-
dant.

Next Week li's Style

Smile . . . laugh . . . grin . . .
snicker . . . or just sit back and
roar. But any way you look at
yourself“ next week. you should
see a big, broad, beaming smile,
for March 9 through 16 is Na—
tional Smile Week.

If someone steps on your big
toe. smile. brother. smile! If your
professor tells it story that might
possibly pass for a humorous
anecdote, smile. In fact, it pro-
longed guffitw might even be
adequately appn-clatcd. When
you receive your draft notice,
you might try shilling. Maybe
your recruiting officer won't be
able to defer you but he might
return a smile that is just as
friendly as yours.

If you're in doubt as to what
a smile looks like. go take it puck

in the Valley," has written the
Broadway hits, “Lady in the Dark"
and "Lost in the Stars.” some of the
score of “Down in the Valley" is
based on such familiar American
folk songs as “Down in the Valley,"
"Hop Up, My Ladies." and "Sour-
wood Mountain.“

The scenery of “Down in the
Valley" follOWs the pattern of
Thornton Wilder's “Our Town,” in
that it is kept to a minimum and
changes are made during the per-
formance. The change of sets will
be done by the chorus, which is
modeled after the choruses used in
the ancient Greek plays. The ef-
fects of the minimum stage setting
will rest largely on the use of light-
ing techniques.

"Trial By Jury" will be presided
over by a bewigged Learned Judge.
Poor Angelina and her estranged
fiance, Edwin. and other members
of His Royal Highness' Court will
be dressed in typical nineteenth
century costumes. In direct contrast
will be the costumes of “Down in
the Valley.“ The hillbillies of Ala-
bama will be dressed in blue jeans.
bright flannel shirts, full drindle
skirts and peasant blouses.

The double bill promises to fur-
nish a gala evening for performers
and audience alike. Admission will
be by student tax. so claim your
box curly. And don't forget to dig
out your oper-cilu glasses.

Tomorrow night. State College's

game. The game against New Paltz
will be played for the beneﬁt of the
“kid around the corner!" The ad-

State Strong at Page

State has proved exceedingly
strong on the home court all sea-
son. losing only their initial game
to Maritime Academy. other teams
such as Utica and Oneonta were
easily defeated on the Page Court
but were too powerful for State on
their home court. The Plattsburg
game was similar to these other
games, the only reason for not los-
ing this one also was Walkers sen-
sational. last—second basket. The
New Paltz game was to be the final
game of the season for the Hath-
nwaymen. but a double postpone-
ment of the Willimantic game has
made the Willic game. the final
one instead. No definite date has
been named for this game. but
March 12 is the date for which
Coach Hathaway is attempting to
schedule Willimantic.

State ’l‘rounccs New Paltz

Last Saturday night. the Feds
strengthened a 2 game win streak
with a 67—45 win over New Paltz.
State jumped off to an early lead
and never relinquished it through-
out the game. New Paltz presented
little in the way of opposition as
State held complete command for
the majority of the game and in-
creased their lead with apparent
ease. Captain Bob Brown led his
teammates with a 19 point out-
burst.
.l. V. Vs Booker T. Washington

State‘s J.V. will encounter one
of the top notch amateur basket-
ball teams, Booker T. Washington
Center tomorrow night in the pre-
liminary. Jim Bennett has return-
ed to action and Jack Fernandez,
injured two weeks ago. will also
be in the line-up. The return of
these two plus the recent fine show-
ing of freshmen, Bob Coan, is sure
to bolster Garcia's club’s offensive.

According to James Cole '52
Chairman of Student Union Board,
Bob Massey's orchestra will play
for the Student Union dance. All
freshmen girls may stay at the
dance until 12:30 a.m.. but must
go directly from the dance to their
residence houses at that. time.

Supreme Court Ruling Upholds
Constitutionality Oi Feinberg Law

In its first Supreme Court test
the New York State's Fcinbcrg Law
was upheld us constitutional this
week in a (Ho-3 decision. The stat—
ute prohibits employment in this
state‘s public school system of any
person advocating overthrow of the
Federal or State Government by
force or violence, or any person
holding membership in an organ-
ization which preaches such a doc-
trine.

Conflict came over whether or not
the law. enacted in 1949 chiefly to
keep Communists and fellow-travel-
ers out of the school system. consti-
tuted an abridgement of the right
to freedom of speech and assembly
guaranteed by the First Amend-
ment. and whether or not the pro-
vision making membership in an
organization listed as subversive

 

automatic grounds for dismissal, vio-
lated the due process clause of the
Fifth Amendment.

The prevailing opinion of the jus-
tices was based on the contention
that the state had a constitutional
right to protect the immature
minds of its children from subver-
sive propaganda. Justice Minton in
expressing the majority view stated
that the teachers may still “assem-
ble. speak, and believe as they will,”
and that only their freedom of
choice between employment in the
school system and membership in a
subversive organization was limited.

The dissenting justices felt that
the not should have been struck
down as an invasion of the civil
rights of citizens and a denial of
freedom of thought and expression.
