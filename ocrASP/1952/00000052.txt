Eager Pledges

Innovate Sorority Help Week

“Ker-ch00 . . . Isn't this dust aw-
ful?" “Where can I empty this
dirty water?" “Hey, let's go down-
stairs and play pool." These com-
ments were overheard in the Albany
Boys' Club as sorority pledges
cleaned up the library shelves as
part of pledge duty.

Traditional Hell Week is a thing
of the past, and if you mention it
you'll have to put a dime in the
swear box. Sorority pledges now go
through Help Week as part of their
pledge training.

Help Week does not mean that the
pledges are supposed to help the
members out, although some girls

Student Union Board
Gains New Members

As a result of the abolition two
weeks ago of the Student Union
Commission, five State College stil-
dents are now members of the Stu-
dent Union Board. The commission
was dissolved by the Student Union
Board with the approval of Stu-
dent Council, according to James
Coles '52, President of the Board.

New Student Union Board mem-
bers are: Rudolf DeSantolo, Mario
DeSeve, Roderick Hilsinger, Julia
Korba. and Beverly Pranitis, Jun-
iors, all formerly members of the
Commission. The addition of these
new members will increase the
Board to twelve.

The rules governing the use of
the Student Union at Brubacher
have been posted on the Student
Council bulletin board in Huested
and the Grad Bulletin board outside
the Commons. All State College stu-
dents are asked to review these rules
carefully to avoid the possibility of
violations. according to Coles.

College Men To Take

The Selective Service System Col-
lege Qualification Test will be given
at State College on Thursday, April
24, 1952, announces Randolph S.
Gardner, Supervisor of Mathematics
in the Milne School, The deadline
for applications for the examination
is March 10. 1952. Eligibility for de-
fci'mcnt will be based on this test.

Any men who have registered for
the draft and have not taken the

apparently didn't understand this.
The help was to be given to worthy
charities in Albany and was made
possible through the mutual co-
operation of Inter—Group Council
and Inter-Sorority Council.

The pledges at the Albany Boys‘
Club spent their time dusting copies
of "The Rover Boys at Yale” and
“Tom Swift, Boy Inventor.” At the
Clinton Square Neighborhood
House, girls cleaned out closets and
directed games and square dancing.
The kids say the do-si-do was never
like this! However. some of the
children did not have the highest
opinion of :ollege intelligence. One

effort to helpfully put things away.
waved a bundle of pencils in the air,
exclaiming, "What do I do with
these?“ A small boy replied scorn—
fully, “You write with them."

Now that a start has been made,
perhaps Help Week will become a
valuable tradition. The old-style
Hell master armed with paddle will
disappear and in his place will em-
erge a kindly soul whose chief pleas-
ure is being nice to pledges. No . . .
that would be too much to ask.

Folk Compositions

This evening and tomorrow eve—

curtain will rise on Music Council's
double-billed operetta presentation.
“Down in the Valley" by Kurt Weill,
a folk opera by the composer of
“Lost in the Stars" and “Lady in the
Dark," and “Trial by Jury", a Gil-
bert and Sullivan production, will
combine a cast of nearly fifty and
the College Orchestra under the di-
rection of Dr. Charles F. Stokes,
Professor of Music, and Karl
Professor, Instructor in Music, ac—
cording to Marion Newton ’52,
President of Music Council.

Opera Features Folk Melodies

“Down in the Valley" by the late
Kurt Weill is one of the finest of
American folk operas and is a pro-
duction which was mainly conceiv-
ed to be rendered by non-profes-
sional groups and to provide ap-
propriate experience for the sing-
ing actor or actress who is becoming
so important in today‘s musical
theatre productions. Two recording

companies recently leased record-
ings for the entire performance
with all-star casts. The musical

score for “Down in the Valley" is
a brilliant combination of simple
folk melodies of the American cul-
ture which include “Sourwood
Mountain”. “Down in the Valley",
“The Lonesome Dove", and “Hop
Up, My Ladies". Following the
State College tradition, another
