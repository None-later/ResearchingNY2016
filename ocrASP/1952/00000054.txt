Missing were the earphones, the
only thing needed to make the
group typically UN. Well, there were
a few other differences, too—dip-
iomats, younger than usual, were
seated around dining room tables in
Brubacher Hall, Albany, not in the
General Assembly, New York City.
But most of the nations were there.

It was all brought about by the
International Student Council which
sponsored a tour of Albany for some
thirty foreign students, currently
studying in New York City. Playing
hosts were Albanians, in whose
homes stdents spent the weekend,
and State College-ians, who enter-
tained the group for lunch. Mon-

Board Releases

Rules For Use
OI Snack Bar

Members of Student Union Board
have released rules for the second
time concerning the use of the
Snack Bar. Many students have not
been observing these rules, declares
James Coles '52, President.

The Board asks that those who
frequent the Union put their coats
in the check rooms. Card games are
not to be played in the Snack Bar,
but in the game room. Nor are
dishes to be taken into the lounges.
They may be taken into the game
room provided that the Snack Bar
is filled to capacity.

In regard to the procedure con-
cerning the obtaining of rooms for
various activities. the board has es-
tablished definite rules. Anyone
wishing a room in the Student
Union must fill out a card obtained
from the Secretary to the Dean of
Women. He should then contact
Mrs. Merlin Hathaway. Social Di-
rector, for information regarding
furniture and rooms which are
available. Whoever makes these ar-
rangements should check the dia-
gram of the switchboard operator
to locate the rooms to be used.

 

Switzerland, Palestine and about
ten other nations were represented
at the luncheon. In the informal
atmosphere, students chatted free-
ly, despite language handicaps. But
there were a few problems. Two
students from Colombia had been in
the States only sixteen days, and,
per supuesto, they found their in-
terpreter very helpful. The Iranian
made use of audio-visual aids at the
dinner table. Trying to explain the
location of his country, he decided
the best thing to do was to draw
a map.

Asked what he thought of the
United States now that he'd been
here a while, a Brazilian student re-
plied, ”Well. you‘re not all gang-
sters!" He thought his cities were
much nicer than ours, and express-
ed his disappointment of our sports.
He likes typically Latin American
soccer best.

Most of the students are study-
ing here so that they may improve
their business relations on return-
ing to their native countries, where
they are engaged in various pro-
fessions: medicine, law, and cloth-
ing manufacturing. They also want
to better their knowledge of the
United States.

Meeting these students is a tre—
mendous way to learn first hand
about Otifl‘l‘ nations. Wish they
could have spent more time with us.

Last week’s A.D. play in assembly
got off to a good start with a very
nice curtain speech by Ruth Dunn.
the director, in which she highly
commended her east of newcomers.
We would like to say that Nancy
FCCICI‘ and Pearl Szabo adequately
filled the parts of the money-
grabbing sisters. Their actions
however, were at times rather un—
natural and were exaggerated to
the point of distracting the audi-
ence. The two husbands displayed
varying aspects of bad chuructcr-
izations. Bill Staiits (another new-
comer! depended too much on his
voice which. though good. caused
him to lose out in his presentation
of character movements. The sec-
ond husband, played by Bill Haw-
kins (not a llL‘WCOlllt‘l'l, gave 11
rather spotty performance, lacking
both voice and action. While por-
traying the grandfather very well
movement-wise, Louis Vioii dciriic-
ted greatly from what was an In-
teresting climax with his poor voicc
qualities. Rose Mury Keller us the
young daughter, Victoria. displayed
u thorough understanding of her
character and added greatly to [In-
em II) which the play was set. The
set was very suggestive of the large
interior style of the '90‘s and es-
tablished quite well the general
mood of the play. Extensive re-
search Into the style of the period

was shown by the use of props
and costumes. Despite the apparent
inadequacies of the cast. Miss Dunn
did an excellent job in pulling the
play together into a co—ordinaied
whole that seemed to afford the
audience considerable enjoyment.

24¢ I 3“ It

By DON BURNS

 

Congrats to Coach Hathaway, the
basketball team, Jake, Captain Bob
Brown, and an the managers on
the fine record they posted this
season. A good job Well uone . . .

As my part of completing the
season, I would like to make the
more of picking what I consider the
Ali-Opponent team that faced the
Feds this season. Here they are . . .
Forwards, Rasmoussen, Maritime,
and Huntington, Uneonta; Center,
Valenzi, Utica; Guards, Gill‘l‘ow,
Plattsburg, and Donaghue, New
Paltz.

The JV. under the capable guid-
ance of Joe Garcia and Pete Telfer,
are also deserving of praise for the
line record they had. I think these
boys would pick the Booker T.
Washington Center “Globe Trot-
ters" as their All-Opponent squad.
These kids put on a great show . . .
and boy was my face red . . . eh,
Peter!

There seem to be a few people
on campus in direct opposition to
the move for Football at State next
year or in the near future. Seem
as though they base their rejection
of the plan on the ground that we
can only give estimates on the cost
of fielding a team.

I wonder if they want us to dig
up some football team, have th.m
play for a year, then submit a re—
port on how much that first yiar
of football cost us. Looks like they
are putting the horse behind the
cart as the saying goes. It is only
good logic that we cannot producc
an itemized account of what the
actual cost of Pat Carlo‘s "opera—
tion football" will cost.

1 will venture to say that the
fact finding committee appointed
by Student Council will undoubted-
ly come up with as close an esti-
mate for the initial season as any
that could be garnered. There will
he no glaring miscellaneous items.
or lines for keys in this estimate, if
that is what's bothering our dis—
contented element.

The Varsity Club did a fine job
of promoting the Polio Game . . .
glad to have Able Abel Blattmzinn
back with us again . . . how lllllil\'
of you would like to contributi- lo
a crying towel fund for our collegi-
ate friends over in Londonvillc . . .

With only 26 games left to be

the iacc for play-off positions is
getting hotter and hotter. At a lea-

The league leader at present is Pot-

and SLS.

The point of interest however. lies
in the last two or three spots open
for the Post Season Tournament, to
which the top eight clubs are invit-
ed. A scant thirty percentage points
separate the sixtn and tenth place
clubs. and the rest of the schedule
holds a set of crucial tilts for these
clubs seeking berths in the tourney.

The inspired Angels rapped the
unbeaten Potter team 42-33, Mon-
day night, to end the season‘s long-
cs. win streak at 14. A strong zone
defense and a lot of hustle were
i..e factors that helped the St.
Mary's men pull off this upset. Artie
Hudson, former Niagara eager, and
Tom Zowinc were the cogs in Angel
ozi'cnsc. Both these boys scored will
and set up plays all over the floor.

Ped Victory Over New Paltz

Concludes Successful Season

Peds End Slate
With 13-7 Mark,-
Six Year High

Winning seven out of their last
ten games, the State College varsity
Labhcbuﬂll team posted its best won-
luau mark since Coach Merlin Hath-
away LOOK the ieins in 1946. Con-
stantly building, Hathaway culmin-
ated his enorts by flooring a squad
01 young, last ball hanuiers, and,
with the help of graduating Senior
Boo Brown, one of the most capable
tail pniyers to don a State uniform,
has emit a well rounded, smooth
working outfit.

Season Highlith

under the guiding hand of Cap-
tain Boo brown. the hoopsters cop-
eo thirteen out of twenty games for
il peic.ntage of .650. High spot of
In”; stason was a 98-75 conquest of
oneciita which represents an all-
time n.in for a Hathaway coached
State quintet. Another stellar team
Dil'iOI'IlliUlCE was the 81-80 over-
time wm at Plattsburgh, featured by
Hiram Walker’s 75-foot one hander
in the last seconds of play to force
the game into an extra stanza.
Speaking of Walker, his individual
hot streak, scoring 22, 25, and 30
points during the Fed’s three game
skein. was the most superb indivi-
dual s-coiing exhibition of the sea-
son.

Brown To Be Missed

Captain Bob Brown and his
stcadying influence. his ability to
set iip picks and plays on the out-
side, excellent rebounding under-
neath, playing wherever called up—
on by Coach Hathaway will be sore-
ly missed next year.

Tabor Tops Peds,
Starting Five Hit
Double Figures

A second half flurry of baskets
enabled State College's Varsity bas-
ketball team to notch a win in their
final game of the season last Satur-
day night by a 73-48 count over
New Paltz. The fast. aggmive
style of play portrayed throughout
the game by State was typical of
the way the team has been playing
all season. 'Bob Brown, who rounded
out his college career, turned in a
brilliant job both defensively and
offensively and no one had any
doubt as to why Bob was considered
one of the stalwarts of the squad
for four years.

New Paltz Strong 'TII Half

New Paltz, who had upset Oneon-
ta on their home court just the
night before, gave State a battle for
the first two periods and the 30-25
edge held at half-time by State did
not look too substantial. The second
half of the game was an entirely
diﬂerent story as State showed why
they had rang up six straight vic-
tories at home as they repeatedly
scored on fast breaks, well executed
plays, and accurate shooting. Bob
'i‘abor's 9 points paced State's tor-
rid attack in this canto.

State Sets Torrid Pace in Fourth
Fans forgot all about the third

period play by the Hathaway men

as the fourth period got under way.

the entire fourth quarter, the visit-
ors could show only 9 points on the
scoreboard as State was splitting
the nets for 19 points. The entire
starting five hit for double figures
with Bob Tabor's 14 markers lead-
ing the way. Hoppey copped second
scoring honors with 13 points, while
Brown, Zongrone and Contra each
hit for 10 points.

Peds Have Good Season

This sensational climax was only
fitting for a great season turned in
by the Feds. Their 13-7, won-lost
record is the best posted by a State
College team for quite some time.
Still a greater accomplishment for
the Hathaway coached men is the
phenomenal 7-1 record posted at
home, the seven wins representing
a noteworthy win streak.
