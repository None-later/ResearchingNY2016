Goddess Minnie's Past Reveals
Make-Up Exams, Sacrificial Fire

From whence has come Minerva?
How is it that she graces Draper
hotunda? Her story begins with the
turn of the century.

Several years ago students were
charged a dollar if they wished to
take a make-up examination. When
a considerable amount had been ac-
cumulated, the administration
bought Minerva. Thus the Rom-an
Goddess of the professional arts, and

Council To Interview

ard Skidmore, Professor of Modern

Dr. Skidmore will discuss folk-

wisdom came into existence as a re-
sult of the desire of students to of-
fer proof of their wisdom.

At the time of Minerva’s entrance
into State College, the college build-
ings were located on Willet Street.
In the year 1906, a fire broke out in
the wing which housed the primary
department of the practice school.
The ilames spread throughout the
main building destroying everything
but Minerva. Her location was the
saving factor. She was standing un—
der an arch in the center of a court,
while the surrounding buildings
burned. It was almost as though
someone was offering a sacrifice to
her.

Minerva was then put into stor-
age until Draper Hall opened in
1909.

She was turned over to a renovat-
ing squad who painted, polished her,
and provided her with a new spear.
She then stepped upon her pedestal
and has remained there ever since.

It is fitting that the patronness
of painters, teachers, and craftsmen
be honored at this time. Minerva’s
festival has always been celebrated

in March.

New Alphabet

So you thought you know your
alphabet. Well here is a point
of information. A is no longer
for Apple. nor does B stand for
Ball. C now represents some-
thing more than Cart or Call.

Here's two to one that you are
now thinking of the ABC's in
terms of modern usage. Such
as Always Buy Chesterfields or
the American Broadcasting
Company. Sorry. wrong again.

Take a look at the Bulletin
Board in second floor, new Dra-
pcr. There you will see a differ-
ent alphabet. the ABC's of
Teaching.

According to this alphabet. A
means “Animate your teaching."
B rcprcscnts “Be proud of thc
tcaching profession." (‘ offers
it littlc advice. “('hoosc ficlds
of teaching with care."

Z sums up all thcsc suggcs-
lions. “Zoom your tcaching,r to
more ci‘i‘cctivc and productive
lcvcls by actually putting into
practice these ABC‘s.”
