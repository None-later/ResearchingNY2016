Whose Fault is It? '

As far as SA government is concerned these days
it appears as if the students are not interested.
People read their News in assembly; discussmn

. is slight. Some leaders will declare off the record

(of course) “isn‘t it terrible how apathetic the
students are?" Perhaps it would be better to say
“isn’t it terrible how apathetic the leaders are?”

Let’s analyze the government. According to the
constitution of SA, Student Council “will intro-
duce legislation and act as an advisory board to
SA.” Yet, how many Council members do you
ever hear speak in assembly? You‘re probably
lucky if you know who is on the Council. When an
issue is presented to SA which Council has approv-
ed it. ends there. Certainly SA must be aware that
everything that goes through council doesn't go
through with a unanimous vote. Yet. do we ever
hear of the "minority group” of Council. Do they
ever throw questions on to the floor (as they did
in the Council meeting) in order that SA can an-
alyze both sides of an issue? These same people
will walk out of assembly and say “SA voted blind-
ly." Of course they voted blindly but did these
leaders contribute anything to the discussion to
prevent them froin doing such?

It seems that the interest in assemblies has been
on a downward trend since 1949. Some people be-
lieve that the veterans were willingr and more ex—
perienced in getting up and ﬁghting for their own
ideas. Nowadays leaders are too interested iii hop-
ping on the bandwagon and being liked by their
friends rather than pursuing their own ideas in
front of the group which will lead to the good of
the organization. Perhaps, leaders, instead of run-
ning around discussing how uninterested everybody
else is, the first step is for you to find out how iii-
terested you are. What is your contribution to SA
assemblies? Leaders should not have to be prodded

. a true leaders leads: he does not need to be
pushed.

Missed The Boat?

From the letter to the editor printed this week
in the Artur, it seems that some individuals missed
the boat as far as the News” Boards stand on steal-
ing is concerned. We should like to take this op—
portunity to claiify any misconceptions.

The News liotti‘d in the editorial column last
week was in no way endorsing stealing. Perhaps
we were looking at the thefts rather practically.
The places in which most of the articles which
have been taken were outlined in last week's edit-
orial: tiic locker rooms and the women's room in
lliiesled. it appears to be more practical and more
protecting to the individual student to teach him
to take care of his articles in the places provided
than to carry on an investigation. Students leave
new coats in Hiiesled; others go to gym classes
with their lockers wide open because they don't
want to bother to lock them. The Artur was mete
ly trying to inform SA that it is not safe to leave
any articles around (particularly in those three
places) and that a minimum of stealing will go
on if less opportunity is offered to the thieves.

The News iloard iii no way declared that it was
the only solution to the problem. it stated one
solution to the problem which it felt would be the
most immediate help. it did not declare that it
was against an investigation these interpreta-
tions \verc misconstrued.

STAT! COLLEGE NEWQ. FRIDAY. MARCH 21. 1952

a .‘.I

awn-31am

By SHAFER and KELLER \

 

To the Editor:

During the past few months.
there has been much talk about in-
itiating football as an intercollegi-
ate sport at State. Although I do
not know when the powers that be
will present their plan to the S.A.,
I feel that there are several points
which should be considered.

Several years ago, during the de-
bate on the appropriation which
established intercollegiate soccer
here. the point was made that since
we had no Fall sport. soccer would
be an inexpensive way of ﬁlling
that gap. The backers of the plan
stated that by limiting ourselves to
this one sport. we might be able
to soon develop a soccer “power.”
Because of these arguments many
were persuaded to approve the ap-
propi'iation.

Now there are those who want to
establish football. a sport which
not only will cost an estimated
$12,000 and mean a $10 increase on
every student tax, btit also will be
in direct competition with the soc-
cer program. Since the enrollment
at State is comparatively small, I
cannot see how two sports can be
successfully pursued simultaneously.
One sport is enough. If it is to be
football, the money spent on soccer
for the past two years will have
been wasted.

I also understand that there
would be the possibility for it phys—
ical education major if a football
program were inaugurated. It seems
to me that this should be reversed.
If it becomes possible to major in
plin ed.. then football would also
become a possibility. There is just.
not enough talent here now with
which to build even a half—way
decent team. The only state teach-
er's colleges which now have foot-
ball are Cortland and Brockport
tBuffalo. possibly). but all of these
schools have extensive phys. ed.
programs. Let's face it! This col-
lege just does not attract many of
the athletically capable. and of
these few, those who plan to go otit
for basketball are not allowed to
participate in any Fall sport what—
soever. Even with the proposed
large freshman class next. year.
there will not be a very substan-
tial male increase because of the
draft.

These are only a few of the things
to be considered. I hope you bear
them in mind when the football
proposition is brought up this
Spring.

Stanley May '52

To the Editor:

We've been hearing a lot. of talk
lately about the possibility of State‘s
having a football team. and that
action will be taken in the near
future. Most of the affirmative ar-
guments for a team have been ex-
pressed by the men. Now we'd like
to bring otit some of the opinions
voiced by the women.

We feel that through football
State would become better known
to the public as well as prospective
college students. Almost 100'; of
the Class B. A and AA high schools
do have football teams. 11' we could
offer these students football. along
with the recently improved academ—
ic program. we would have a better
chance of enrolling them.

In the Capital District alone there
are 2:3 high school football learns.
It seems plausible then that many

of the football participants from
these high schools would i'ut her
come to State than to another

school that has football. judging by
the approximately 000 coinnnitci‘s
tliitl we already llll\l'.

it'iniinctng it football team would
probably lllt'ttll it felt dollar addition
to our student tux. Sure, he know
that it seems a lot right now, btit
think it over. This ten dollars isn‘t.
needed tomorrow or a week iroiii
tomorrow. biil next I“:iil at. the
earliest, For the guys it might mean
staying home a couple of Saturday
nights this summer. or to the girls,
one less skirt in their new li‘ull
wardrobe. lint wouldn't it be math
11'.) Alter all ,wc'll all be working
this summer and cotlltl quite t‘nalil
put aside ten dollars for it cause
as worthwhile its this

Atiioiig your concepts of typical
college life don't you ittifoiiialtcally
include it football game, marching
band. anti lloineconiitig dancc'.’ At
State We can have these things
along with our excellent dramatic

and musical organizations and still
maintain our present high scholas-
no standing.

How about it kids? Let’s give
football the chance it derserve at

[‘0 the Editor:

What? 'l'hieves around State Col-
lege? Yes! So we should learn to
Wine care or our stun. And is this
one only answer to the “age of
problem ‘1 When it reaches the
paint that the locks are broken tor
purposes or looting, the problem is
more than ordinary. We have tried
to take care 01 our stuff. To carry
boats. coats, umbrellas, and lunches
Wlbil books to Classes is not only in-
convenient, it is unnecessary.

We fully realize that individuals
Within or Without a profession vary
in regard to ethics. We face “real-
ity' or the Editor’s conception of it
talthoug‘h we somehow cannot see
way stealing must necessarily be
accepted as reality when something
can be done about it.i Nonetheless.
because we realize it. innst we live
with it and let it be? Is this the
poticy of our paper on all issues? We
think not. or rather we hope not.

Obviously persons with a tendency
to steal exist in our college. Fortu-
nately a few people are concerned.
They have the foresight to realize
that even though nothing has been
none in the past. by pressing, the
problem, something might be done
in the present.

Somehow we hardly see the com-
parison between a ‘tcacher" smok-
lllg‘ and a teacher stealing. Is a
teacher supposed to steal? Is any-
one supposed to steal. teacher or
otherwise? Yes, individuals vary, but
do we have to let them vary to the
point of infringing upon others?
Feat-her. stigma. or what you will,
this is the time to discover and cor-
rect them. It does otir institution
proud to know that these people
leave our school to direct the future
of our children. Direct them to
stealing? And we. their fellow class-
mates. have been sitting back, “tak-
ing care of our stuff” and watching
them go on to higher and greater
things.

Right now these people are in a
minority. But wheii the student
newspaper, supposedly reflecting
the student body of opinion. virtu-
ally endorses thctn, the way is wide
open for not only ('Olltllllllllg but
enlarging the present problem.

BUDGETS . . .

You kick about your student tax. but we bet
most of you will just sit back during the budget dis-
cussion and not give a hoot about where your inonev
goes. For example, Student Council, in scrutinizing
the D and A budget, found an item for $12 for be-
longing to a national dramatics organization; when
questioned. the D and A representative stated that.
there was little or no beneﬁt derived from this ex—
pense, yet we have been paying for it for years. This
is just one example. but when such things as this are
added up year after year. the students feel the pinch.
We urge you to listen closely today! Does WAA need
a new bowling ball every year? Do we need two sep—
arately ﬁnanced modern dance groups on campus?
Do Primer and the Directory look for the least ex-
pensive place for the best work to have their books
published? It's your money . . . Keep your eye on it:
OUR SONGLEADEIt . . .

The idea of giving a test to candidates for song-
leader just as they are given to student government
candidates is a commendable one; however. we ob-
ject to having a faculty member decide our issues .
and this could be the first step in that direction. The
atnendment to the amendment was neither thought.
out well in advance nor expressed well . . . we now
need a bylaw to determine just what qualiﬁcations :1
songleader should have and who will decide on can-
didates. A student running for government office can
study his handbook before the test. but whither go-
cst thou. candidate for songleader. to study for your
test?
0N ASSEMBLIES . . .

Last Friday‘s assembly was stipposed to include :i
“For the good of the organization“ session. and as
you ktiow, this session was put off for the second
time this year. We think it is very bad planning to
try to squeeze such an important thing into a 15~
minute. period .We are sure several students have
grievances and they are entitled to a chance to ex-
press them. Just one grievance would probably taki-
at. least 15 minutes. so why can‘t we have two full
period assemblies “for the good of the organization“
. . . one each semester? Certain of our student lead~
ers are in favor of a similar program. but they may
need a little prodding . . , It's tip to you!

Speaking of grievances we would like to mention
one big one concerning assembly. and that is llll'
attitude of the students. Maybe there should be a
course here on "How to be bored gracefully." Olli-
organiiiafion on campus has already stated that they
would no longer bring a speaker to assembly because
of the rudeness of the students . nothing is so
distracting to a speaker as to have the headlines of
a newspaper staring them in the face. Maybe your
assembly seat isn't your most prized possession, but.
if you‘d listen once in a while. yoti might ﬁnd that.
assemblies can be interesting.

FOOTBALL . . .

You are to be confronted with the facts soon; next
week's assembly will be turned over to the Football
Investigation Committee. Here are a few things to
be thinking about . . . and we hope you will. just for
a change. The committee lins worked with Coach
Hathaway to fl'llll‘t? the income figures at a minimum
and expense figures at a maximum, so that the must
it will cost us individtially is $10 per undergraduate
and $5 per graduate student. The budget. covers an
8-giinie schedule. btit only 5 or 6 will inaterialm-
There are 9 colleges we could play that are in our
caliber and within reasonable distance, as far as is
known at the present. When we figure that our Stu-
dent Association budgct will be $20,164; our Athletic
Association budget approximately $9,000; and the
football budget. $17800 . . . we cati figure on a total
tax of around $30 per student. The question then is:
will the. benefits we derive froin a football program
baiaiice the increase in our expense? This is for each
individual to decide, not each fraternity. not the lilil‘
letic group not the dramatics group, etc. Dont' turn
this important question into a stupid, mud-slinging
brawl rv'l'lllllk for yourselves!
