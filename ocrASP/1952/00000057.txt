Foreign Families
To Accommodate
Area Delegates

Diplomats To Interpret
Customs To Community

For the fifth consecutive year the
Schenectady Community Ambassa-
dor Project is planning to send two
or three representatives from this
area abroad for eight weeks to live
and work with a foreign family. The
ambassadors are sent for the pur-
pose of developing better under-
standing between the people of this
area and those of foreign countries.
To Represent Life of Area

The ambassador. who is sent at
the expense of the community, has
two jobs to perform. He must rep-
resent this area, its way of life, and
its problems to his or her new
friends, and he will be asked to in-
terpret to the sponsoring community
the customs and problems of the
people among whom he lives.

Urges Seniors To Apply

Seniors from the Schenectaciy area
are urged to consider this broject.
To meet the general requirements
the candidate for ambassador must
be between 18 and 30 years of age.
It is necessary that he be a high
school or college graduate, an Am-
erican citizen able to obtain a pass-
port. and be in good health. Knowl-
edge of a foreign language will be
helpful for the position. however. it
is not essential.

It is important that the commu-
nity representative have personal
presence. the ability to express his
ideas before groups. and that he be
available to give speeches in Sche-
nectady County during the next
year. Interested students are asked
to contact Elmer C. Mathews. Direc-
tor of Teacher Placement Bureau.

Tuesday night saw the last of this
year‘s A.D. lab productions. The sea-
son of ups and downs was brought
to a close on a high level. with San-
dei's' psychological study and
Hughes‘ poetic drama.

In Sanders‘ production, let the
stage crew take their bowe again
for a well—perfected. realistic set.
Hawkins. as the cynical judge,
showed much improvement over
past performances. but slipped out
of character a few times. Marcia
Griff. the acquitted woman. was not
too convincing. but in her hypnotic
scene. captured the audience com-
pletely. Had his costume been tain-
er. and his make-up more convinc-
ing. Henderson could have pulled
off the role of the doctor. but those
factors. coupled to seine unsurety in
movement. left him without much
depth of character. The minor
characters were adequate. although
at times rather awkward, and the
pace was good enough to place
Sanders as one of the better direc—
tors of this season.

Laurels for the evening. however.
go to Hughes. who showed us some-
thing warm and humble. Again new
faces spurred the play. This time it
was Jim Erlandson and Alessandra

144 .7 See It

By DON BURNS

 

It does a person's heart good to
see a gang of guys having it out
on the hardwoods two or three
times a week. Clean play and keen
competition being the chief element
concerned. This. in a nut shell. is
the fundamental make up of any
intramural program.

The idea of IM play was intro-
duced by the famous deposed Army
leader, General MacArthur. when
he was Commandant of the Corps
at West Point. His manifold inter-

est being to activate as many of

the cadets as possible. It is easily
seen that this type of competitive
sport program has been quite suc-
cessful in all spheres of society.

Our own IM program under the
hand of Coaches Hathaway and
Garcia, with the cooperation of M
AA has prospered and shown won-

derful results for the post war
years.
When you find beginners. sea—

soned ball players. former college
stars. and outstanding amateur
players all playing in the same loop
and getting along reasonably well.
you seem to realize that the IM

program is all-embracing and that hi

everyone benefits from its exist-
ence.

This brief speel gives me an open-
ingr to make my nominations for
the various All—1M teams. First, I
would like to give my choices for
the MII’ fivc. Most Improved I’lay-
ers team. that is! The leading can-
didate here is Rudy Bode of the
Fakcrs. One, of his teammates. Ar-
nie Smith is also deserving of the
honor. “l’udgie” Lampman of the
Beavers, Ed Bonahue of the Red-
skins, and Ben Button of Thurlow
round out this quint.

In my book. Artie l-Iudson. Angels.
Pete Tcifcr. Potter. Flush Fox. K.
DR. John McCormatk, Trotters.
and Bill Dunn of the Clowns make
up the All-Star team for this year‘s
IM loop.

Potter Clinch 1M Title;—
Tourney Starts March 28

Coming into the last leg of an IM
Basketball season that featured 17
teams playing a total of 272 games
shows the championship clinched
by a powerful two-platoon Potter
Club. However. a host of teams are
still battling for a berth in the News
Sportswriters‘ Tourney, which will
see the first eight clubs in the lea—
gue playing a round-robin elimina-
tion. The tourney will begin on
March 28, and all details are yet to
be announced.

Top Teams Triumph

Monday night saw three first divi-
sion clubs swamping the opposition.
KB led by Ryder and Wander with
14 and 16 points respectively crush-
ed the Clowns 48-28. The contest
saw KB get off to an early lead and
increase it to 15 points at the half-
time.

In the second game of the triple
bill, Potter Club took their 16th win
against a single loss by trouncing
the Trotters 61-39. For the men
from lower State Street. Telfer was
high. intiassing 21 markers. while
Egert and Kaehn helped contribute
to the win with an even dozen
apiece. The Trotters had two men
in double figures. McCormick with
16, and Stella with 10 points.

Angels (‘ontinue To Win

The last tilt saw a l‘f‘jiil’l‘iliiit‘d
Angel team. riding high on the
bowels of handing Potter Club its
only defeat of the year. crush it for-

lorn KDR quintet to the tune of
46-29. Hudson sparked the winners
with 17. but had to share top scor-
ing honors with Fox of KDR who
hooped a like amount in a losing
effort. Zowine helped the victors
along with thirteen points.

Saturday marked a new record
for forfeits in the loop, with four
being posted. Whether due to mid-
seins, or lack of interest on the part
of eliminated teams. the Angels and
Trotters staged a unique double for-
feit; EEP gained a triumph the easy
way over the Clowns; KDR did like~
wise to the Redskins and SLS suc-
cumbed to the Fakers via the for-
feit route.

In the only contest played on
Saturday the Pantywaists beat the
Oeelots 53-32.

On Tuesday. the Ocelots bounded
back with a three point conquest of
the Redskins. The game. being a
battle between two second division
clubs, was close all the way. In the
second half. the lead changed hands
numerous times and it wasn‘t un-
til thc filial 30 seconds that the out-
come could be determined. Dreher
and Bud Brewster paced the win-
ners with ten points apiece while
“Serge” Krchnlak tossed in 15
points in a losing cause.

The game marked the final show-
ing of the Redskins this year as the
whole intramural league winds up
its season.
