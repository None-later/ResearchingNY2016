Davis Arranges
File Alterations
In Press Bureau

Procedure for making changes in
the Press Bureau files has been an-
nounced by Maureen Davis ‘52, Di-
rector. Arrangements can be made
by Seniors to have their pictures
accompany notices of their gradu-
ation in the home town paper.

Any student who wishes to make
alterations, such as a change in ad-
dress, in his Press Bureau folder
may write it out and place it in
the Press Bureau box, Lower Dra-
per, so that the files may be revised.
These ﬁles are used for informa-
tional purposes in sending out press
releases to the student’s home town
paper. This is especially important
to Seniors if they wish their grad-
uation notices to appear in the cor-
rect newspaper, states Miss Davis.

Students who wish a photograph
to accompany notice of their gradu-
ation should place a glossy print
of the picture in an envelope and
either give it to Miss Davis or place
it in the Press Bureau mailbox.

Athletic Board Expresses Views

State College Athletic llcoard, after consultation with the col-
lege administration, makes the following statement of its position
with regard to inter-collegiate athletics in general and inter-collegi-
ate football in particular. We affirm our conviction that Student As-
sociation is a body responsible and competent in the determination
of policy governing student affairs. The question of inter-collegiate
athletics, however, is not a concern of Student Association alone, bill
is inevitably also :1 matter of college policy and State University
policy. it is for this reason that this body,thc State College Athletic
Board, was established by Student Association last lune. in pcrior—
malice of its functions this board needs from the Student Association
an expression of opinion in guide it in lhc formulation of policy,
in discussion with college and State University policy officcrs. ’l‘hcrc-
fol‘c Siliic Coilch Aihlclic lioal'd rcqucsis advisory votc from incin-
bcrs of Siudenl Association on thc following resolution.

Rcsoivcll: i. That members of Studcni Association bclicvc
that inter-collegiate football is fczisibic at State College

ll. That they express their willingness to support the csillb—
iishmcnt of u collch football li‘tiili by an additional student tax of
not to exceed ten dollars.

ill. That they encourage the State (‘ollcgc Athletic Board
to discharge its proper function, the dcvclopniclit of inter-collcgiziic
ziihlctic policy including,r football for report lo the Stildcni Associa—
lion not later than l)cccniber, 1052.
