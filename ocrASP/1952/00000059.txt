Three years ago, the question of whether or not
State College was ready for football as a varsity
sport came up and was decided in the negative.
Today Student Association again faces the prob-
lem. Are we ready now? This is a debatable ques-
tion; however, from the uninformed and vascilla-
ting opinions evinced by SA, it is evident that we
are not ready to discuss, let alone vote upon the
proposal intelligently. We cannot decide such an
issue upon emotions alone—facts are mandatory.

The responsibility for putting these facts into
the hands of Student Association was placed upon
an investigation committee appointed by Student
Council. Unfortunately, due mainly to outside and
inside pressures to push the proposal through, all
factors of the situation and all questions arising
from it do not seem to have been considered. A
cursory examination of the committee report re-
veals many misconceptions, inconsistancies, and
misleading statements.

The report points out that the administration
has said it would hire another full-time coach,
should SA vote approval for a football team. Act-
ually, Dr. Collins stated that if the students favor
a teatn, additional coaches would be necessary, and
that he is willing to hire them. This is a different
tnatter, for, while willing, he cannot hire addi-
tional personnel for next year since the budget
has already been tnade up and does not include
provision for their salaries. Also, the proposed
budget contains a provision for two or three as-
sistant coaches, but these individuals become cin-
ployees of the college and State»--—it is not within
the province of the students to hire them.

We cannot hope for State financial assistance.
The State pays for the instructional program
otily. While it does supply assistance for equip-
ment for physical education coarser. it does not
support inter-collegiate athletics at any college.

The administration feels that perhaps the place
1.0 start is with facilities and not with a teatn. The
first priority project of the capital construction
program of the University is building the gym
and playing fields. Housing is to be dis—
continued ai this site in the spring of 195.3 and
it is reasonable to assume that we will have a gym
with complete facilities and playing fields in the
near future. regardless of whether we have a foot—
ball team or not.

The budget itself should have been set iip by
the Athletic Association, not by two individuals
as was the case. Iti considering the financing of
the program which, after all, is basic to any itti»
dertakiiig, Student .»\ssociaiion would do well to
raise a few questions. To whom would we sell .lOO
season tickets. (‘an we expect support to the tiitic
of 52,000 frotn the alumni? Where is a tcatn doc-
tor provided for? Should football be considered
for its prestige or for its enjoyment? What would
it do to the social calendar of the college? How
long before we can expect expenses to go down?
Do we want to devote over half of our student tax
to athletics? llo we want to undertake something
the college doesn‘t have the facilities to handle?
And lastly, will a football program add anything
to the college as a teacher training institution?

These attd other questions need answering be»
fore football at State (‘ollcgc can be adjudged
feasible or tttil'casiblc. worthwhile or ttot worth
while. Should we vote football in? Today, no-
when we know what we‘re dealing with. then we
catt consider it. What we can approve today is me
vcstigaiion furl/hr, thorough, am] impala/d] I...
tore any action is taken oti the issue, The inves—
ligation committee was appointed as a "fact find»
ing" hotly. I.ct's litivc tl/i lite facts.

STATE SUPPORT . . .

There has been a recent trend to look for State
support for some of our activities. student Councti
is now looking into the prospect of getting this sup-
port for repair of musical instruments, AD. and ED.
labs, and Press Bureau. Yes. we need support, but.
there is another side to this issue. If the State sup-
ports us financially, isn’t it possible that they will
want to control the use of these things? It would be
so easy for them, for instance, to stipulate the use of
musical instruments so that they could not be used
for anything bitt class purposes, barring our use (,1
them for extra-curricular activities. The AD. spring
play would also be a very vulnerable spot for the
state to lift; if we stop supporting AD. and leave it,
entirely to the State, they could cut us down to the
barest tninimuin. We agree that any effort to decrease
expenditure is a worthy one, but we feel that we are
entitled to some sort of guarantee frotn the State as
to how far they will go.

MORE ABOUT CASDA . . .

Our earlier remarks about the use of our lounge for
CASDA purposes seem to have been misdirected. The.
problem is still there, but as we now understand it, the
fault is not CASDA‘s as much as it is the administra—
tion's. As we now understand it, CASDA has tried to
get a smaller room for their meetings, but have got—
ten no action from the administration. Okay, so may»
be our criticisms were pointed in the wrong direction.
but let us repeat we think it unfair to students to be
deprived of a place to study like the lounge.

FOOTBALL .

Today's the day, folks. In assembly we begin dis»
cussing the football question. This is the most cott-
trovcrsial issue in our college this year, and not it
matter to jump into without considering all the pos-
sible facts. There seem to be three groups of poten-
tial voters on campus: Those pro-football, those anti-
football, and those who stand undecided, of which We
are a part.

Here are a few questions we'd like to pose to ille
committee. How will the draft aiicct football? Why
are other colleges dropping the sport or cutting down
on it? With two major sports in the fall, will we get.
enough support for both sports? Do you think altitniii
will continue to support us if our team isn‘t too good
the first couple years? We realive it is not really in
the power of the committee to answer all these qiies»
tioiis. since one cannot see the outeotnes of a football
program until it has been tri;d. But, the question
now is when should football be approved?

We think the football committee has done a cotit»
mendable job in their investigation and should be
congratulated for it. We think a good football pro»
glam would tnean a lot in the way of State College
prestige. With 10,000 alumni to be contacted, we fe l
with a great deal of effort, that we coitld get a lot
of support for football: if each alumnus were to do-
l‘tllt‘ Bill: a year. even. it would mean $5,000 toward
the sport. This is a big "if." Will they all acttially be
contacted and what percentage will contribute? it
this could be done. in the second or third years of
the program it would provide at least half of tin-
necessary tnoney.

When you go into assitnbiy, go with an opcit mind.
(10 to ll'lli‘ii something nobody has all the answers!

 

STUDENT (‘()17N(‘ii.

The interest shown over the football issue if] Wed-
nesday's Student Council meeting was very hcartctt
ing, especially after the lethargy Student Absllt'itilltil
has recently been cxpericttcing. We feel that if n!-
tciidaitce at Student Council meeting by members of
Student Association was that. high more oiicit. our
govci'niticni would be rttn more effectively attd more
people would be satisfied. .
