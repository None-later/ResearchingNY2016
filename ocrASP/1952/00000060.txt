To the Editor:

As we finish two days of debat-
ing on your campus, the Regional
Debate Committee has asked me to
draft a letter expressing varied
sentiments: all of them complimen-
tary.

You are fortunate to have so
many students interested in activi-
ties in which they are not particr-
pating. This was evidenced by the
great number who attended de-
bates. providing an audience better
than we have enjoyed on any cam-

pus, regardless of the host. The

coffee hours, too, were a delightful
way of becoming acquainted With
your friendly student body.

You are fortunate that all of the
campus organizations cooperate on
all-school events such as this one.
We noticed the school newspaper
furnished copies for each guest; the
radio people interviewed guest de-
baters for a radio show: the tele-
vision people saluted the guests
with a special program; the com-
merce people took charge of sten-
cil-cutting and mimeographing for

iors are very disgusted at the pres-
ent situation.

To the Editor:

Along with several other State
students. we are against Varsity
football at State at student expense
for the following reasons:

ll) Other colleges are trying to
play down football because it is one
of the most dangerous sports ialso
because of the possibility of passing
otherwise poor studcirt, etc).

i2i We have enough Varsity
sports for our small male population
since Rivalry, intramurals, and oth—

much time already.

To the Editor:

What has happened to Campus
Commission? Has it gone off carn-
pus or does it consider Page Hall
at Friday assemblies as out of

bounds?

It used to be that seniors were
shown a little respect and let out
of assembly first with Campus
Commission members and tryouts
keeping other classes in order. It
used to be that Campus Commis-
sion members were on the job at
least five minutes before assembly
ended. Now it is almost impossible
to find Campus Commission mem-
bers and seniors must wait while
even freshmen go out ahead of

them.

STATE COLLEGE NEWQ. FRIDAY, MARCH 28. 1952

p44 9 gee ’1 Football Record,

By DON BURNS

 

You need only to scan the con-
tent of this page to realize my con-
victions about the gridiron game
at State. I believe football will be
a great aid to the whole college and
to the entire city of Albany. If I
might repeat myself I believe I will
quote from a column edited by me
last Octobcr. "This town is ripe for
College football and its present
sorry sports picture is an indica-
tion of the market for the grid—
iron game. The plight of today's
Capital District sports picture stems
from the inadequacy of spectator
sports. Albany offers two principal
spectator sportsﬂone a so-so Minor
League baseball team and the
other a small college basketball
team trying to go big time. The
sentiments of ilic city officials al-
ready have been fell out and lhcy
lend ii favorable hand to this cause.
thus assuring easy procuremcni of
municipul facilities."

At this stage of the development,
there isn't a strident. in the (‘ol—
[go that is worried about the
touchdowns, games, or practice
field that will be involvcd when
football does come to State. The
biggest thing in their minds is ilic
estinnitcd tax of ’I‘ICN DOLLARS.
It's only it word. and it's only an
estimate. At the most, if the idea
is passed, the tax will run no high-
er than seven dollars. It must be
remembered that the estimate was
made up with expenses ill a MAX-
IMUM and income ill. ll minimum!
When bids shirt to bc offcrcd on
cqiiipmz'nt by the various sporting
goods firms, the estimated prices
will lie sharply undercut with ll re-
sulting‘ knockdown on ilic "sup-
posed" tcn dollar tux.

For 3 Seasons

in view of the present interest in-
cited irr footbuil it might be worth-
while to survey the history of foot-
ball hcrc at N.Y.S.C.T.

Football had a short. three-year
reign at State College. In 1922, ’23
and '24 the statesmen compiled a
record of 2 won. 14 lost and 3 ticd.
In 1922 football originated at State
with the starting eleven being inns-
tercd from a try-out squad of twen-
ty men. Due to the small amount
of interest. the team could do no
bciii‘r than “.2 tics und 3 dci'cuis with
neighboring clrvcm of Union, Roch—
f‘~l(‘l', RPI. Unioti rc-crvcs. and

undertaking as tremendous as this,
it was of utmost import that
the report be thorough and unbi—

Busing my opinion on the

I am firme convinced that
football Is well within the realm
of practicability at State (.‘ol-
lcgc. Brockport and (‘orthind

and $40 respectively. and re-
ccive State aid for Varsity
sports. Our proposed student
tax would not exceed the low-

I Yearling Evaluates
Pigskin Possibilities

By BOB ASHFIELD

Do we want football at State or
not is the big question now. To me
there doesn’t appear to be as big
a problem as many people or at
least some people seem to think. If
we made a list of advantages
and disadvantages, the advantages
would outweigh the disadvantages
tenfold.

Dramatic vs. Athletics

We at State are quite proud of
our dramatic courses and we are
all the time bettering them to the
point that now we receive recogni-
tion from other schools in the dra-
matic field. Not that I am knock-
ing the dramatics but from how
many schools do we get recogni-
[ion for our athletics? From this
we would think that our graduates
would be in great demand as dra-
matic coaches. but it was found
that. many more of last year's
graduates were hired as part-time
athletic coaches than were hired
for dramatic leaders.

Football at other State COIIBHCS

Many people will come up with
ini- age-old argument that Albany
Slaic is 0 liberal arts college
whose graduates are supposedly
secondary school teachers. Now tell
me would it be breaking an old
tradition for a State Teachers Col»
lcgc to have a football team? It
seems flint I have heard of cor-
lain mid-western State Teachers
Colleges having football teams—
hus anyone heard of Michigan
State and Ohio State, just to men—
lion a couple.

’ihe thing which seems to hit
closest to home is the money prop-
osition-yes. when ii comes to cori-
sidcl'lilg l.ll(‘ cost of anything we
really ponder the queslion. Cer-
irunly the proposed 10 dollars
looms as u vusi mnount of money—
