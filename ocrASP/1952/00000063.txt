For Student Fund

Contributions To Benefit
State; College Scholars

Contributions can now be made
to the Memorial Student Loaii
Fund. This fund was set up in order
to satisfy the urgent need for more
funds available without restriction.
and to honor those students who
gave their lives in World War II.

Student Association allocated
$1500 more than two years ago as
an incipient donation for the fund,
which has'now been set up by the
Student Aid Committee as the
Memorial Student Loan Fund.

The Memorial Fund is to be a
revolving fund. with both princi-
pal and interest available to any
student in good standing in the
third, fourth or fifth year at the
college. No interest is charged the
student while he is in college, but
begins at 5% the month after he
leaves college. The loan is to be
repaid :1 year after the student has
left college.

Any organization or group who
wishes to make a contribution in
its name to the fund may do so
by giving their donation to Ainard
Gelbond, Financial Secretary of
the College.

and asked who did it. ’l"abe gasped
