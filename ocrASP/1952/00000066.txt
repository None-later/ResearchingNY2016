Spring Cleaning
Strikes Campus

Yes, this is about Spring, that
favorite time of poets and
lovers. We know that the ma-
gic season has finally come to
Albany because of the new
green leaves, the daffodils and
hyacinths bordering the class
buildings. The campus has been
all spruced up with a brand
new sign announcing to all the
world that this Is THE MILNE
SCHOOL.

How many of you were sure
you had gotten Into the wrong
room when you wandered into
the new, new Commons. Var-
nish certainly did wonders for
the old splintering floors.

Now that Spring cleaning is
in order, might as well clean
out those old moldy text books
and see what they’ve got to say.

44 I See It

By DON BURNS

 

Can you imagine Milwaukee
without Schlitz. salt without pep-
per. Mei Allen without the Yanks,
Niagara without the falls, or Al-
bany without the Democrats? Com-
parable to this, can you imagine a
college baseball team without a
diamond to practice on? Well we
have one! The Fed nine has had
to spend its initial drills in the
gym or on the inadequate facilities
that could be found. It’s feasible.
but that won't help Coach Hatha-
way and his baseball aspirants who
go after their first victory in to-
morrows opener. Good luck boys.

Liked Dan Parker's obituary of
the Robinson-Graziano “fight”—
ouit: humorous and to the ‘point.
He called it “the greatest mistake
since the 1948 election." Harry S.
might not like that. after all he
KO'd McGrnth and Morris all in
one day. One thing we can concede
though is the fact that all these
parties lasted a little bit longer
than our football team. It only took
one punch to put that move to
sleep for awhile!

With only ten days gone in the
new baseball season, I think I'll
stick my neck out and give you my
choices for the Series come next
fall. The Red Sox in the American
League . . the Indians, Browns.
and Chisox rounding out the first
division. Now. now. you Yankee
fans let's face it. Ill the Senior
Circuit I look for the Phillies to
slip in while the Cards. Dodgers,
and Giants press for the other top
spots. Don't call the wagon. just
call lne optomistic!

We are still accepting entries in
the horseshoe tournament we start-
cd last fall. If you get your entry
ill soon you may be the first one!
This page would like to :‘ponsor or
help to sponsor a horseshoe, tennis.
and golf tourney. mixed or other-
wise. as long as we can find some
interested parties. Remember, in
Spring young people’s thoughts
turn to . . . w:‘ll anyway if you're
interested, let me know.

I-lu'mor: 1n Babe Herman's hay-
dny in the majors. a good number
oi‘ the sportswritcrs pokid fun at
him for his dull—wilted comments
and speeches. Irkcd with it all,
Babe challenged them to ask hiln
an intellectual qcustion. He was
asked what he thought, of the Na-
roleonic Era; the Babe noncha-
liiniiy replied. "it should have been
~col'cd as a hit.”

League Opens

Tuesday’s openers in the Men‘s
Intramural Softball Leagues proved
to be slugfests with a total of 74
runs crossing the plate.

The men of Kappa Delta Rho ac-
counted for more than one-third of
the total by trouncing the Rousers,
25—6.

Hiram Walker. Bill Wiley, Tom
Hopp-ey. and Chuck Del-win each
collected round-trippers for the
winners while mate Bob Hausner
had a perfect day at the plate get-
ting 5 hits in 5 attempts. including
8 doubles.

The Rousers used a trio of huri~
crs in their attempt to thwart the
fhomen. but the efforts of Brown,
Wellderfich. and Smalling proved to
be of little consequence.

Tabor Effective With Ducks On

In the only other game of the
day, the Flnks beat the Sox 8-6. Bob
Tabor proved effective in the
clinches. getting batters out twice
with the bases loaded and with the
potential tying runs on in the final
inning. Ben Button hit a homer for
the winners while George Lein and
Kurt Valentine did likewise for the
losers.

On Wednesday Potter really bak-
d the Biscuits. 20-3. Pete Teller
gave up only 3 hits while collecting
3 for 4, includingr a double, for the
winners.

’3

MOIrlsj‘ and Connacher each
banged out homers. Ray Champiin
also collected 3 for 4 and hit two
doubles. The Biscuits scores came as
a result of two errors in the infield
in the last inning.

Garcia Issues Call
For Soccer Players

Yesterday began the spring soc-
cer practice at Bcvci'wyck Park.
Coach Garcia states that there will
be daily practices starting at 4 p. in.
This program will continue through
May 29, and will be cliinuxed by
two games, one with State alumni
and the other with the JV's.

Inadequate Field.
Hampers Squad

McCormick Will Open "
On Mound For State

Tomorrow afternoon at 2 pm.
the State College baseball team will
inaugurate the 1952 baseball sea-
son when they engage Potsdam at
Bleecker stadium. Many new faces
will appear in the line-up for state
as 10 men were lost due to gradua-
tion, many of whom played a lot
of ball for the squad.

The pitching staff suffered the
least as they lost only Bob Hausner.
Herb Egert, Red McCormick, and
Larry Daly are back to take up the
slack. Newcomers who have im-
pressed Coach Hathaway so far are
freshman, John Zidik and John Mc-
Cormick, a transfer from St. Mi-
chael‘s. The backstop position va-
eaten by John Stevenson is being
battled for by Bob Dreher and Don
Capuano. Dreher has the inside
track so far based on his fine all
around performance and strong
throwing arm.

All Positions Still Wide Open

Battles are being waged for all
infield positions. Ken Rutley, Fran
Rodgers, and Bob DeMichelle are
the first base candidates. Al Call-
non, and Ray Wolfe are working
around second base and Abel Blatt-
man and Bob Sage are aiming at
the shortstop position. Joe Stella
has been moved to third base and
is holding ills own in the new po-
sition.

Another scramble is looming in
the outfield as there are no veterans
returning for duty in the outer gar-
dens. Candidates who look very
lzromislng so far are Bob Sturm.
Jim Bennett. Arnie Slnith. Don
Leln. Tom King. and Dec Combs.
Several others have not been chalk-
cd off yet.

Coach Hathaway says the team is
not ready for its first game due to
the lack of a field on which to prac-
tice. So far this week practice has
centered around hitting and get-
ting the arms in shape.

McCormick Named To Hurl Opener

Red McCormick is slated to start
on the mound for the Statesmen
tomorrow afternoon. blit due to the
short training period no pitcher will
attempt to go lnore than 3 innings.
