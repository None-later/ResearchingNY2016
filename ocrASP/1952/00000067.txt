Point Out Trends In Education

Information on teacher place-
ments at State College for last year
is on file with Elmer C. Mathews.
Director of the Teacher Placement
Bureau. Statistics indicate that
there were more vacancies than the

crease. Although placements in the

various ﬁelds illustrate definite
trends. it is important to note that
these are trends of the moment. It
is difﬁcult to predict with any cer-
tainty demands for the future.

By state law salaries are now set
at a $2,500 minimum for a BA and
$2.700 for an MA. in communities
of less than 100,000. In larger cities
the minimum is $200 more for both
degrees, while in New York City.
the minimum is raised by $300. Men

Loan Fund Donations can usually receive slightly higher

Any organization that so desires
may make a contribution to the
Student Loan Fund. The fund was
set up by the faculty for students
in their second, third or fourth
year in memory of Dr. Ralph G.
Clausen, late Professor of Biology.
and Chester J. Terrill, late as-
sistant professor of commerce.

Organizations should make their i

salaries than women.
Calls for straight commerce run

high. while it has been quite com-
mon to receive demandsfor Eng-
lish-social studies. especially in jun-
ior high. The combination of Eng-
lish with drama and speech or with
a language has also been frequent.
