Poor Hurling,

Weak Hitting
Lead To Loss

Tomorrow afternoon State's Var-
sity baseball team will take to the
road again to meet Danbury. Dan-
bury. State’s third opponent in the
early season, was defeated by the
Feds last year.

Walks Lead to 14-8 Loss

Last Saturday afternoon in the
first game 01‘ the season. Potsdam
upended the locals 14-8. The 17
walks issued by State's mound crew
led to their downfall. Part of the
ineffectiveness of the twirlers can
be traced to the lack of a mound on
the playing field and the lack of
a place on which to practice ade-
quately. The absence of power at
the plate also hurt the Feds
greatly; six hits were all that
the team could muster. The one
bright spot of the game was the
catching performance turned in by
Bob Dreher. Dreher, only a fresh-
man. is obligated to fill a very im-
portant role and from the looks of
his initial performance, he will do
just that.

l’rzu-ticc Stresses Hitting, Pitching

Coach Hathaway has been trying
to bolster both the hitting and the
pitching during the practice this
week. Dre Combs is being converted
from an outfielder into a pitcher,
and so far has portrayed a fine fast
ball. The most thorough practice of
the SL‘Ziaoll was held Wednesday
night at Ridgefleld. IL was the first
limo that any sliding drills could be
prurtlod and also the first time
1‘1: infield could really take practic:
