Spring and tests go hand in hand,
but here's one kind that you should
not worry about. According to the
Educational Testing Service. it is
senseless to cram for aptitude tests.

"A good night's sleep before the
big test is more important than
cramming." says Henry Chauncey,
President of Educational Testing

 

Grad Club Members

To Select Picnic Date

To allow SCAGS a choice in se-
lecting a date for their picnic, vot-
ing will take place outside the
Commons until 4 pm. today, ac-
cording to Richard Poultridge,
Grad. Chairman of the event. The
picnic will be held at Thatcher
Park.

A sign up sheet will be posted on
the Graduate Bulletin Board. Each
Grad should sign his name under
the date he prefers. The result will
be posted on the board Monday.

  
 

 

Service. Maybe you won't believe it,
but the experts claim that cram-
ming for this sort of exam Just can’t
be done. “The best way to make a
good score on such a test is to take
it in stride."

These tests require the candidate
to reason, since they involve verbal
and mathematical problems. sounds
hopeless. but such reasoning in-
volves innate brain power plus years
of training and cannot be altered
in a few weeks.

When the University of Chicago
based ..cholarsliips on factual exams,
a nearby school that made a speci-
ality of cramming took almost all
available scholarships. But when
the University changed to a test of
ability to learn, this school received
fewer awards.

Testers also have made a study of
veterans in colleges. Results? Mar-
ried veterans made better grades
than single ones, on this type of
exam. Well, men, draw your own
conclusions. It is spring, you know!

Jokes Brighten
Tearful MUD

In Spring a young man's

fancy turns,

Flowers bloom, trees are in

bud;

’l‘cars bedlm our weary eyes

()n thinking about MUD.

Sad. ain’t it? Well, cheer up.
Drown your sorrows in these
latest jokes. straight from the
1921 News. (Jokes?)

There's the one about the poor
frosli they found freezing to
death in Washington Park. Said
the trash, “They told me to do
some outside reading!"

He saw her stepping from the
car,

And up to her he, sped.

“May I help you to a—liglit?"

"I do not smoke,“ she said.

'l‘lirn there's this one:

“Have you ever seen a (log
cry?"

“No. but I've seen a mothliall."

Still with us? Anyway, you‘ve
got to admit, there are sadder
things than moving-up!
