Draft Worries . . .

It appears that recently a number of male stu-
dents in the college have received reclassification
notices from their local draft boards. Immediately
thereafter, many of them were ordered to report
for pre-induction physical examinations. As a re-
sult, we have noted a considerable amount of con-
fusion on the part of those receiving notices as
to why their status was abruptly changed, whether
their student ratings are no longer recognized, and
whether recent actions of the draft boards indi-
cate that they are being considered for immediate
induction.

While no definite advice can be offered, a note
from a member of the college faculty signifies that
the reclassifications are not to be taken as indi-
cative of any definite change in the policy of the
boards. Since most of the status changes have been
from Z-S or l-S to A-1, male students have had
considerable cause for alarm; however, we have
been assured that the boards contemplate no ini-
mediate alteration of the treatment given college
students. Apparently, most of the Selective Serv‘
ice Boards in New York State are, at the present
time, attempting to adjust their files. For this

Why has rivalry slumped? The blame for this has
to fall on the shoulders of '53 and '54 as well as the
Seniors. When '54 came here as freshmen, '53 was lll~
tent on winning rivalry. since they had lost the pre-
vious year. and had little time to be friendly. '52
was '54's sister class. but how much help did they
offer? Again ‘52 was still so busy tossing its laui-els
around that instead of encouraging their freshman
sister class. they assumed the attitude of being "above
all that," and the only mention of Rivalry was, “Oh
that? You should have seen us do it!" Consequently.

Vickery Explains
Center's Work
With Community

Course Develops Skills
For Leaders Of Youth

"What does the Center for Com-
munity Studies do?” To answer this
question Dr. William D. Vickery,
Professor of Community Studies,
has released a statement written by
Herbert P. Davis. Research Assist-
ant.

Flrst. the Center helps students
obtain experience that will help
them develop leadership skills in
working with youth groups. This is
a very desirable skill for teachers
who will advise extra-curricular ac-
tivities in their high schools. The
Clinton Square Neighborhood House.
the YWCA and YMCA, and the
Jewish Community Center offer ex-
cellent opportunities for gaining
this experience.

An accredited three-hour course
——Sociology 110. Intergroup Rela-
tions in the Community—is offered
to Juniors and Seniors by the Cen-
ter. The members of this course ex-
plore the concepts of youth group
development organization. and the
functions of a group leader by direct
personal experience while leading
their own youth group. For those
not able to take this course. the
members of the staff are always
available to consult with them about
problems which may arise for group
leaders.

The Center is also ri resource ca-
pacity for students and faculty in-
terested in Intercultural Education.
The Center assists members of
graduate seminars doliig intercul-
tural and intergroup research pro-
lee-ts.

The Center also works with in-
scrvicc teachers in the Capital dis-
ti'lct.
