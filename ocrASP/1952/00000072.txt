’4‘ j 5“ It Allasio’s Superb Pitching Leads To KDR Triumph;
Hayseeds Surprise Powerful Beavers With 8-5 Upset Victory

By DON BURNS

 

It’s interesting to see that you.
Student Association, have so much
confidence in the AA Board in their
first year of existence. We (the
Board) met all our required duties
in presenting the Budget at an
open hearing. I was deeply moved
to see that We had three students
who were interested in the expend-
iture of nine thousand dollars of
their money. Yes, you are to be
complimented on the interest ex-
hibited! That meeting socked you
in the purse for six bucks come next

September. Don't get the wrong
idea. you're the ones getting

panned, not the Board. Something
to be noted is the fact that of the
three people present, two were from
Student Board of Finance and the
other a scribe from this page! There
was only $9,000 at stake, not a Riv-
alry point!

Glad to see that MAA is origin-
ating a Sports Banquet this year.
The hooks are out to line up a major
sports figure to speak. The date is
May 29, keep it in mind, the chow
will be good and fun had by all.

Hottest ball club in the IM Soft-
ball loops is the Hayseeds. Bill Dunn
and Co. (lumped last year‘s Champs.
the Beavers. and the Fiiiks on suc-
cessive days last weekend. Inspired
ball playingr was the key to their
success. In another dandy, Pete
Teller was one out away from a no-
hittcr when Dong Thornc strode out
of the dugout and dropped a single
into right field. Just call him the
"Spoiler."

This column represents the last
of the ninth for this scribe and I
would like to take this opportunity
to give due recognition to the won-
derful staff with which it has been
my honor to work for my few years
with your sports page. Best of hick
to my successor, who will comc out
of the ranks of that top notch trio
cl Julie Korba, Doris l)olicrty and
Abel Blattman. I know Joe Luce will
do a hang up job next year, along
with the potential pcns of this year‘s
newcomers. Bob Ashficld, Walt
Lawdcr, and Tom Hoguc. This gang
has been tops with me and I hope
that all their1 copy is available on
Tuesday nights next year.

In retrospect, I can see that the
sports picture at this college has
been favorably broadened by the
presence of this year's graduating
class- and that the Class of  has
set a trend. got the ball rolling. so
to speak. I can only conclude with
a really heartfelt bit of advice to
those aggressive personalities on
campus that are in favor of sports
expansion . . . keep this trend on
an upward swing and keep after the
Administration and AA Board for
a full scale report on football, lhc
key to your success is in procure-
ment of the gridiron game.

Page and Beverwick fields saw
much action this week as Bob Jac-
oby, the Intramural Softball direc-
tor. planned a busy schedule. KDR
and the Hayseeds played three
games: Potter Grads, Potter Club
and the Rockets played twice. SLS
dropped from the league, diminish-
ing the number of games to be
played.

Allasio Wins

The game of the week pitted Pete
Teller of Potter Club against John
Allasio of KDR. It was a grim pit-
cher's duel for the first five inn-
ings. The sixth inning saw Potter
commit four miscucs as five runs
scored and KDR secured a 9-2 vic-
tory. Tom Hoppey led the KDR
team to the win with two hits and
numerous spectacular catches in left
field. McDonald, Streeter and Pal-
zak pa"cd the losers in hitting with
two singles apiece. Ray Champlain
was stellar in defensive play as he
:atrolled center field expertly. In
the other two games KDR defeated
the Dams 21-2 and the Kadavers
20-7. Allasio hurled a two hitter
against the Rams; Perry and Bur-
roughs each collected the base
knocks. Hoppcy. Dcrwin, Walker and
Englchaz't were the heavy hitters
for the victors. In the third game
held to four hits by Allasio. the
Kadavcra could only muster seven
runs. This proved too little as KDR
collected 19 hits and ‘20 runs. Chuck

Dcrwin went three for three to pace

the team at the plate.
Hayseeds Win 2, Lose 1

The Hayseeds defeated the Beav-
ers 9-5, the Finks 20-13, and lost to
the Rockets 9-8 as the result of this
weeks action. Dunn pitched all three
games for the Hayseeds and was
opposed by Clark of the Beavers,
Fay of the Finks and E1dl'i"h of
the Rockets. In the Beavers game
Dunn and Moot paced their team
in the hitting department. Playing
against the Flnks, Kirts homered
with the bases loaded and turned
in some stellar fielding to secure the
victory. Eldrich of the Saint Mary's
Rockets pitched a creditable game
as he led his team to a conquest
of the Seeds.

Corsi Defeated

Carmen Corsi of the Harmless
Blanks was his own worst enemy
as his team lost to the Rockets,
15-9. Giving up eight walks and
hitting one batsmen, Corsi proved
the difference in the game. How-
lcit and Brenzel proved the scoring
punch for the victors while Meyer
and Wicks led the losers at the
p‘atc. John Eldrich was the winning
pitcher.

KB sent Taylor to the hill against
Beneiiati for the Biscuits and the
result was a 6-5 victory for KB.
Wander and Smith were the big
guns in the scoring.

Garcia Plans
Soccer Sessions

Coach Joe Garcia, in a meeting
called Tuesday for soccer candi-
dates for the '52 season. announced
that spring practice will be held on
Tuesdays and Thursdays only. The
reason for this move was the difﬁ—
culty in obtaining a large enough
turnout to warrant a practice ses-
sion daily.

The main purpose of spring prac-
tice is to give those men who have
had little or no experience an op-
portunity to learn the fundamentals
of the game.

Garcia is also concerned about
the lack of interest among the vet—
erans who will be returning next
year. These practice sessions are
also important in that they afford
these lettcrmcn and the J.V. men
a chance to get in shape and iron
out some of their mistakes.

The team should develop into one
of the school‘s best. Possibly with
(inc- exception. the entire starting
eleven from last year will be re—
turning to face a rough ten-garlic
schedule.

creditable 2-0 record in the weeks
activities as they swamped the Sox
and the Jerks. Backed by spec-
tacular fielding. Rock-Hill gave up
six hits as be defeated Pete Bon
and the Sox 18-1. The Jerks had
just as much trouble with the up-
per classmen as they bowed in de-
feat to the tune of 16-3. The latter
game had Rockhill facing Art Weig-
and.

In Wednesday’s games Potter
Club faced the Rams and came out
of the slugfest with a 15-3 victory.
Pete Telfer hurled a two hitter as
he overpowered every batter ex-
cept the opposing pitcher, Ken Stev-
enson. Teller. Streeter. and Can-
onlca led the team in batting.
Centra starred defensively. Carmen
Corsi and the Harmless Blanks
proved not so harmless as they got
their batting eyes in the top of the
seventh, scoring four runs and de-
feating Bob Tabor and the Finks.
6-3. Bailey. Corsi. Fox and Wicks
were instrumental in the scoring.
KDR Leads League

In summary the weeks action
finds KDR and the Potter Club un-
defeated and leading their respec-
tive leagues. KDR has a record of
4-0 and the Graduates have achiev-
ed a 3—0 average. The Hayseeds are
in second place with a 2-1 record.
Allasio leads the pitchers of the
league with four victories and Rock-
hill is second with three conquests.

Blue Jays Take N
Rivalry Soltball

The Sophs added to their rivalry
score during the past week by win-
ning both the men‘s and women's
softball contests. Saturday the men
defeated the Gremlins 23-6 and the
women downed the frosh 6-2 Mon-
day evening.

John Allasio was on the mound
for the Blue Jays Saturday when
they ran away with the game.
Frosh pitching was weak. Will Bosh
was replaced by Wally Helm after
allowing seven runs in the top of
the first. Helm was relieved by Coan
after allowing two more. The inning
ended after ninctccn Sophs had
been to bat. knocking in 14 runs
to the Grcnilins' single tally. The
frosh had a rally in the third when
they drove in four runs.

Monday. the Gremlins again bow-
cd in the pitching duel between
Edith Titterton and Ruth Richter.
Although she was the losing pitch-
er, Tittcrton managed to strike out
six Jays. Heavy hitting marked the
Soplis. Nella Bertin made a triple
in the third. driving in three runs.

State Attempts

To Snap Streak,-
Plays Two Games

Attempting to snap out of their
present losing streak. State will face
two tough opponents in three days
next week. On Monday State will
journey to Hartwlck and then will
engage Plattsburg on home ground
Wednesday.

Last week Utica and Danbury
both kept the Feds from entering
the win column with 15-6 and 11-1
wins respectively. Loose fielding on
the part of the Peds led to the rout
by the Uticans. A total of 17 errors
were chalked up in the free for all,
2 being committed by the locals.
Red McCormick started and went all
the way for the loss but deserved
a much better fate as he doled out
only 9 hits. State garnered a total
of 8 with Al Cannon and Bob Dre-
her each collecting two.

Lack of Hitting Costly

State’s failure both on offense and
defense led to the il~l shellacking
by Danbury last Saturday. Dan-
bury's Benzing yielded a mere 3
hits, with Cannon again getting
two and Dreher collecting the other
single. John McCormick started on
the mound for the Pads and faced
only 9 men in the first 3 innings
but had trouble in the fifth inning
and Dec Combs came on to finish
up the game.

Cannon Leads State's Hitters

The over-all trouble with State
appears to be “poor field. no hit."
The hitting will definitely have to
pick up if State wants to have a
winning season. Al "Boom-Boom"
Cannon alone has been consistent
with 6 hits in 12 trips to the plate
for a neat .500 batting average.
