For the first time this year, no

arm-bands, and red canes. shaking
with nervous anticipation. It was
time for the Old Order to change.

The old order of" Myskania did
change. giving way to six new men
and seven new women, who, with
mixed emotions. mounted the stage
to become the 36th Myskania.

Amidst cheers, tears and kisses,
the new members were welcomed.
Joe Lombardi, his ears numb to the
roar about him. had to be suppo t-
ed up the steps. Barbara Newcombe
was so nervous she dropped her
cane four times. When Betty Platt
was called, she had to be pushed

out of her chair by her roommate.

Signum Laudis, honorary scholas-
tic fraternity, will hold its annual

reply from the initiates, whose

quet will be Marion Gorskie '52.

Seniors To Secure

Grad Study Forms

Edward J. Soho] announced that
all seniors planning to start grad—
tuttc study this summer or ill Sep-
tember should secure application
forms in Room 109, Draper Hull.
Upon completion, the forms should
he lift 111 Room 109. and final ac-
tion on them will be taken when
degree requirements are completed
i'or the bachelor‘s degree.

Men needing letters i'or military
purposes may secure them in the
:cunc oll'icc. Requests for such lct~
tcrs can be made now. and they
will be forwarded immediately.

"I was thankful for my cane," she
said. “and the two helping arms."
The announcement of names had
decided effects upon Pete Telfer and
President Lannon. Pete was wor-
ried they might call his middle
name, and it took only one word,
"John" for Lannon to be on his
feet. “What if it hadn't been me!"
he exclaimed afterwards. "Francis
Patrick“ was enough to send Frank
Ho e‘s biological systems revolving
in the wrong direction.

Hal Smith travelled
read when he walked up to the
stage from first. row. and Hank
Koszewski ran the gamut of emo—
tions: first shock. nervousness. hap-
piness; then, bewilderment, amour.
and. believe it or not, hunger!

Bev Pranitis was in a complete
state of shock for 15 minutes, and
Coy‘s legs shook so she couldn't
walk. Ruth Dunn says that Dave
Shepard anticipated her feelings
when he wrote these last lines to a
poem:

his longest

Left to

Telfer, Pranitis, Newcombe. Lannon, Smith,

"To put it quite bluntly,

I was really in heaven

To be on Myskaiiia

And in seat number seven."

Ann Obei‘st and Rosie Keller sum
up the feelings of all thirteen: “We
were excited. we were thrilled, and
we were grateful."

The whirlwind of events didn't
stop with the excitement on the
stage. At the first meeting of the
new Myskania held last Tuesday
night. new officers Were elected.
Pete Telfer will lead the group as
President, Rosie Keller is Vice-
President. Ann Oberst will act as
Secretary, Hal Smith will treasure
the money, and Betty Coykendall
will be Mistress of Ceremonies.

Now that the confusion has sub-
sided. the new Myskania has settled
down to the business of being the
mast honored traditional organiza-
tion on campus. We wish the 36th
Myskania a successful year.
