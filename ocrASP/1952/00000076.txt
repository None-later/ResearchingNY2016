Look Ahead . . .

Whenever the new and the old get together, there
seems to arise an attitude of “well, you did a good
job, but just wait until I get my hands on “the
reins!” Student Association is going through JIISI:
such a period now with the out-goers not quite
gone and the in-comers not yet in. During this
time we find a sudden decline in the year-long
gripes and criticisms as the high ideals and plans
of new officers are put forward to take their places.

Now that the congratulations have died down
these new officers have begun to look seriously at
the tasks which await them, Student Association
would do well to look at the job which it faces.
Just what can we expect to be the issues of the
coming year? A few can be forecast with some
certainty; many must wait upon our actions. This
year we have seen many new things instituted in
the college—a new building bringing with it ex-
pansion in facilities, a new dormitory and Student
Union revolutionizing our social activities, and, of
course, all the problems which new things bring.
We have not met all of these problems successfully,
probably few of them permanetly, for football, riv-
alry, student-faculty relations, the cafeteria and
Conimon’s situations, and others, all will no doubt
arise again next year. The leaders which you saw
elected last Saturday bring to their offices hiin
ideals for dealing with these problems which they
know to exist and for facing intelligently those
which are still to come. It is your duty to support
them.

What does this support consist of? First, a be-
lief in your leaders and their ideals, and a willing-
ness to cooperate to see them accomplished. Sec-
ondly, interest enough in your government to be-
come informed and stay informed on issues which
concern you and about which you have complaints.
Third, nerve enough to air your ideas, your de-
sires, your criticisms openly so that they may stantl
public consideration. and fourth. and perhaps most
important judging frotn the occurances of this
year, the conviction that critisism is not at end
or an entertainment in itself. Out of wide spread
complaint should come remedial action. Lets not
become so involved iii complaining that we forget
the situation with which we found fault. We can-
not expect one sweeping corrective motion to solve
all difficulties, but we can look ahead with con-
fidence in otir leaders and in our ability to deal
wisely and successfully with each issue as it presents
itself. From you, Student Association, must come
the desire to do so.

Last Show . . .

Another Moving—I'p Day has come and gone.
and with it the climax to that much-criticized in
stitution which we call Rivalry. It is ironic and per-
haps fitting that the deciding factor in such a close
fought contest should be the now~t|iscarded Iiig-
Fours. We can only hope that the proposed All-
College Review can succeed in arousing the iii~
terest and activity in the college as was evidenced
not become enterprizes discouraging under-classmen
from developing their talents iti earlier years.
Big-limits may be dead, but the enjoyment and
the opportunity for developing leadership abilities
which they gave to those who participated in them
have contributed much to making the (iremlins
and lllue Jays a more integrated part of college
life. Let's be sure We have something to take their
place. something to do the job which they have
attempted.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. MAY 16. 1952

 

4W a] ﬂWA}

By ALAN BUCK

Why does the Administration of
the college require the students to
attend the Friday assemblies which
are a student function?

If you expect me to answer this
question. you are due for a disap-
pointment—I cannot.

The assembly is not necessary to
the Administration. Printed an-
nouncements are far more enduring
than verbal ones and they have the
advantage of teaching even those
who do not attend assembly.

Does required attendance at the
assemblies improve the quality of
our student government? You can
lead a student to assembly, but you
can't make him participate. We are
very fortunate to have the privilege
of self-government, but is self-gov-
ernment a privilege or an obliga-
tion? We are obliged to take part
in our government. Certainly the
minimum requirement for voting
and taking part in debates should
be sufﬁcient interest to attend the
assemblies. Some students are in-
terested in our government—some
are not. Those who are interested

_—.———

will always be interested and will
always contribute much; those who
are not interested will never con-
tribute much, even if they attend
Student Association assemblies. Re-
quired attendance does not seem to
assist our self-government, but
rather hinders it by ﬁlling the as-
semblies with disinterested students.

Does our democratic student gov—
ernment have the power to abol-
ish the attendance requirement at
the assemblies? This is another
question which I cannot answer. I
do not know whether or not the
Administration which has given the
student body the opportunity to
govern itself has given it the right_
to determine its method of self-
government.

I understand that there are many
students who do not have the op-
portunity to attend the SA As-
semny because they have not been
assigned a seat. It is with these
students in mind that I hereby offer
my chair to anyone unfortunate
enough to have not been assigned
one and interested enough to want
to attend.

To the Editor:

Now that the Self-Glory contests
are settled, let us turn from moans
over lack of spirit and rivalry to
reflect on some of the inner frailt-
ties of State. We are at present re-
peatedly urged to pay homage to
our deities for providing a million-
doiiar drinking fountain and a
women's hotel. a ﬂuorescent lighted
classroom ediﬁce. a possible football
team, and the prospect of bushels
of new freshmen who may not be
able to read or write but surely will
contribute to the country club at—
mosphere which even the most high
have felt desirable. I wonder if
Harvard, Vassar, or MIT, became
famous because of the quality of
men and wotnen produced. 1 am not
belittling our growth in exterior
facades, but. I do question the neg-
lect of the administration to
strengthen the less spectacular. im-
portant inner-cores which help
make a college worthwhile.

The heart of a university is its
library. We are told of a huge li-
brary nearby. “Nearby” proves an

inconvenient distance for many and
the outside use of its books impos-
sible for most. Those who use our
own library for more than mating
purposes need not be told of the
utter famine of periodicals. the au-
tocracy. or the calisthcnics involved
in romping up and down the fire
esiape which connects one hot
house with the other.

Since the most vital segment of
teacher training materializes in
practice teaching, does anyone do
more than gripe over the artiﬁciall-
ties. nervous prostrations, or minia-
ture Napoleons which are self evi-
dent in the Milne situation?

A third area often forgotten is
that melting pot of favoritism call-
ed thc Teachers‘ Placement Bureau.
When the time comes to all for job

Naturally there are many more
areas of irritation and neglect. un-
touched by this letter, but after
live years of internship among these

have become unduly concerned over
exteriors, a feeling fostered by the
administration as well as many
students. and unfortunately heed-
iess to some of the less glamorous
phases which in the long run may
prove more valuable criteria for 
college experience.

Sincerely,
Gene. Webster.

feat Week in ﬂaaemébf

 

Last week in Assetiibly, the pro-
posed Student Association Budget
for the year 1052-1053 was discussed.
The organization budgets which
\veie considered are: Drannilies

A NEW LEAF . . .

Elections are ﬁnally over, and the momentary turn;
of Moving Up Day seems to have passed. Did We run
for the honor and glory of holding an ofﬁce, or did
we run with the intent of giving a year’s work for
the “good of the organization?" Now, action must
speak louder than the “smiles” and words of put-
election time; it is not only the duty of the individ
uals who have been elected to carry out the function
of their ofﬁces, but it is also the duty and right to
every member of Student Association to make Stir.
that these incumbents do not rest on their past iaur
els. Can we and are we willing to make our liex‘
year's Student Association something that won’t b<
referred to as "apathetic." or are we just going 1.
drift along and follow the same old pattern tha
seems to be so easy to fall into. Will the Facilitit
Board become an active group in fulﬁlling its duties
will members of Student Council be aware of Ill!
fact that they represent their classes and not then
selves; will Athletic Council ever present a constiti.
tion so that we can be sure what their actual (lIlIlt
are . . . ? These and many other questions pertainiiu
to student affairs must be answered to insure a l)cl~
ter working governmentl I hope and ask that Ill“
new officers of all phases of our organization will sin
cerely strive to serve well and efﬁciently the people
they represent. Now that you hold a student job
with the association as your employer. try to re
metnber . . . “A public ofﬁce is a sacred trust!"

BUDGETS, BUDGETS, BUDGETS . . .

Once again we find. due to poor planning. tiia‘
one of the most important student affairs is l)(’llii
rushed. I should think that after years of expcricnrt
we would realize that the spending of $27,000 canno
be settled in a matter of three hours. Last week i:
assembly I could sense that disinterested feeling o:
the part of quite a few members of Student Associa
tion: to tiictn the reading of each individual line o;
the budget seems like a waste of titne, but who iii“
the first people to complain. We don't ask pertincu:
questions because we are afraid the budget wonl
get finished and that special assemblies will need [It
be called. But. how about realizing that it's your
money that's being spent. Last Friday we covered
approximately two or three organizations before ()Ilt‘
person had courage enough or enough interest it.
question the validity of spending money on a publica-
tion. Are we. of State College, so rich that we eat.
sit back and tin-ow a dollar here and a dollar titer.
without questioning its ultimate destination?

Education Club

The Distributive Education divi-
sion of the Commerce Department
at State is formulating plans for
the establishment of a Distributive
Education Club. Under the direc-
tion of Reno S. Knouse. Professor
of Commerce. this organization will
becotne a part of the national pro-
gram.

The Distributive Education Clubs
of America are composed of high
school and college students who are
interested in the comprehension of
distributive processes. This group
first started on a community basis
and grow until 1947 at which time
it was set up on a national scale.
The group encompasses about 300
clubs with an active membership of
about ten thousand students. The
creed of the organization is, “We
believe in the dignity of the distri-
butive profession and in the many
opportunities it affords."

Our college unit will have as its
general purpose experimental and
