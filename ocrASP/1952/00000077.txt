14 :3an

By ABEL BLATTMAN

 

Graduation time always ap-
proaches with a sort of nostalgic
feeling. For those leaving there is
anxiety, for those of us who re-
main, there is a touch of sadness.
We see next year coming, knowing
that certain familiar faces will no
longer be among us. In the field
of athletics the loss of an individual
is always expected, as youth replaces
old age. And. although it is ex-
pected, and inevitable, there is al-
ways the chance that maybe he’ll
be back for another season.

This point is brought out more
forcefully in college, that those peo-
ple who have done their four years'
work. and graduate, will never again
be part of the college.

It‘s difficult for us to picture a
State College basketball game with-
out Brown on the Court. Brown
has played four years of Varsity
ball, and was one of the classiest
players to ever don the Purple and
Gold.

It’s also hard for us to realize
that when Ken Rutley hangs up
his spikes at the end of this year.
that he'll never swing the wood for
State again.

The Bolivian terror. Raoul Nunez.
won‘t be back on the Soccer squad.
and Jake Jacoby won't be drilling
the basketball squad. and others,
all of whom have done their job
and are being replaced.

For us, it‘s going to be tough to
step in and adequately fill the shoes
of our predecessors. We'd like to
express our sinccre thanks to Don
Burns, who so patiently taught
us the trade of sports writing. And
we’d like to dedicate this issuc to
him, and to all the graduating sen-
iors who have helped the progress
of athletics here at State.

We only hope that us we com-
plete our work. we will maintain
the high ideals, and be able to look
back on as fine u record as those
before us can.
