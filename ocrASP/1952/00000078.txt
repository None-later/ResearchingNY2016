Vesrotile Straw
Beats Boredom

Next time you’re down at
Temperance Tavern and bored
(is it possible?), push over to
the counter and grab yourself
a iisti’ul of straws. The price is
right, $0.00, and the uses of this
willing, silent companion are
many more than sipping soda
through a straw.

Evcr try to attract someone’s
attention through all that din?
One straw, one deep breath, and
Wiioosh! Your problems are
solved. If you’re out of cigs, just
light one up. There's no un-
pleasant after taste, and besides,
it's king-sized. Don't throw
away the wrapper, either. That
and a few drops of water can
become a wriggling worm, to
the. delight of your table-mates.

You may even become an ex-
pect srulpior, revolutionize art
with abstractions and mobiles.
All it takes is a little imagina-
tion

immediate future loom uppermost
in our minds. We are disturbed in
by thoughts such as the draft, mar-
riage. and job security. However,
these varied doubts haven't turned
us into "worry-warts." As Penn
Kimball of the June 8th issue 1952,
New York Times. so aptly observed
in his current article, “This Senior
is no starry-eyed idealist. He's not
a curled-lip cynic, either. He is, in
most respects. just terribly normal."

The Class of '52 has taken mili-
tary sci‘vicc in its stride. We lll'e not
indifferent to the draft but, have
developed a realistic attitude to-
wards it. Boili men and women
graduates l't‘illlZC that military
service has become a part of our
way of lifc: and il'ici'ci‘orc, plan
ihcir lives accordingly.

Kimball canvassed this year's
graduates of Columbia. Tlicir ideas
on ninrriagc correspond with those
typical of State's Campus — “Our
gcnci'alion ol girls is rcndy for mar-
i'iugc. but ihc boys arcn't very mar-
riugc-mindcd with no income and a
fcw yours in the army staring them
in the face,“

We arc least worricd about, the
prospects of securing jobs. As all
indications indicate this is a banner
your for job opportunities.

These problems are immediatc.
but ’52 is sobcrly optimistic and
self-confident about the long-range
future. "if is optimistic that the
world situation in general will
somehow work itself out, at least in
no worse fashion than the era of
strain and simmcring conflict which
is all that the class of '52 has ever
known throughout the thinking of
its whole adolescence."

Kimball sums up: “There it
is, the Class of '52, already sounding
like its own twenty—fifth reunion,
pcrhaps. So hard—headed, so analy-
tical. so down to earth and very
possibly. feeling a trifle alone and
abandoned. Safe now in the wide,
wide world."
