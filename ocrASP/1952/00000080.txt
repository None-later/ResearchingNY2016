Baseball Varsity
Employs Yearlings
During Season

Coach Merlin Hathaway’s opera-
tion “build up" has given indica-
tions of success even though the
Varsity nine posted a mediocre won
three, lost six record this season.
With only two Seniors returning.
Coach filled his line up with Fresh
and Sophomore talent as move for
the future. Ken Rutley, regular first
sacker, and Larry Daley, number
one relief twirler, were the only
returning Seniors.

The team was further handicap-
ped by the absence of a field to
practice on. This drawback was in-
dicated in the .195 batting average
and .846 fielding mark.

Hathaway’s work with the year-
lings unearthed enough talent to
promise a good season next year.
Outstanding in this long range pro-
gram were Bob Dreher, a pitcher
converted into a catcher who devel-
oped into a top-notch receiver as
the season progressed. DeWitt
Combs, another Frosh convert, trad-
ed pasture duty for the pitching
mound and is regarded as a comer
as soon as he learns to field this
new position. He has a great fast
ball,

The hurling staff was bolstered
by Sophomore John McCormick, a
transfer from St. Michaels. He has
a wealth of talent if he can master
his control. Bob Sage. in the infield.
and Don Lein, in the outfield. per-
formed admlrably in their first year
of collegiate ball.

Familiar faces from last year's
squad that rounded out the first
nine were Joe Stella. Al Cannon,
and Dick Sturmm.

The big man with the bat this
year was "Boom-Boom" Cannon
who laced the aget at a solid .400
clip. His seven RBI's were tops in
that division too. Ken Rutley's .978
was the top fielding mark among
the regulars.

Main Incinerator
Blows its Top

Most State College-ites man-
aged to live through exam
week with no worse results than
severe eye and brain strain.
But the main incinerator in
the back of Temperance Tav-
ern just couldn’t take it. Last
Wednesday afternoon it threw
up its hands in despair—and
blew its top! It had gone “about
as for as it could go.”

Boxes and waste paper
caught fire and sent out fran-
tic messages via. heavy smoke
signals. Brave students came to
the rescue and a bucket brigade
was formed. Finally, a. fire ex-
tinguisher calmed down the
hysterical incinerator, leav-
ing it cool, collected, and—sop—
ping wet!

The fire was out. and stud-
ents returned to their cakes and
cramming. But there’s some
good even in the worst out-
bursts. Thanks to the inciner-
ator, the Snack Bar served
freshly smoked ham the rest of
the day.

 

St. Mary's Removal
Permits Building Site

With the closing down of the St.
Mary's Housing Project. a great aid
in alleviating the housing shortage
in the area and for the college men,
it is hoped that construction can
begin on the Physical Education
Building and Athletic Fields. Ac-
cording to the Knickerbocker News
of Friday, June 6, the buildings will
be torn down by March 31st of 1953.

It is hoped that revision of plans
which were drawn up about 1942
for both the field and the building
may be accomplished.

The college is suffering from
"growing pains" in sports' facilities
nioreso than in other branches. A
greatly needed baseball field, space
for IM and recreational sports, and
other playing area hold the spot—
light here. The college has already
outgrown the plans as originally de-
veloped. It is hoped that this new
expansion will be immediate to meet
our net-(ls,

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. WEDNESDAY. JUNE It. 1952

Athletic Board Plans
Football Status Report

The Athletic Association will
make its Football Report to Student
Association this Fall as required by
the resolution SA adopted this
Spring.

Pat Carlo ’53, instigated a very
popular move on campus as to the
possibility of Intercollegiate Foot-
ball at State College. A fact-finding
Committee, appointed by Student
Council, gave a rather extensive re-
port on the possibility of the grid-
iron game.

The AA and the Administration
are looking into this sport as a re-
sult of student legislation that es-
tablished its feasibility.

KDR Captures IM Softball Title;
Jol'in Allasio ln [Iron-Man, Role

Suffering only one defeat all sea-
son, KDRs softball team swept to
the IM Championship on the strong
right arm of Sophomore John Al-
lasio. The new champs gained their
title by stopping the Potter Grads
in a two out of three semi-final
series. They sewed up the cup with
two straight victories over Potter
C ub.

A tense ten inning thriller in the
first post season set was won by
KDR 2-0. The Grads bounced back
and outslugged the men in blue

11-9. The third game went to KDR
13-8. Allasio twirled these three
games on consecutive nights. Later
he had it a bit easier, after three
days rest his club downed Potter
6-3 and 10-2, to take the cup.

Heavy hitting by Bill Englehart.
Tom Hoppey, and John Zongronc,
plus. some brilliant fielding and
throwing by Chuck Derwin supple-
mented Allasio's, fine performance.

Each game was well attended as
Page Field was surrounded with
spectators.
