Colleges Bewail
Money Woes

Money! Money! Money! Col-
leges are richer than ever! That
is a “first glance” decision of a
committee investigating the fi-
nancial situation of U. S. col-
leges.

Private gifts have increased
five times in twenty years. But,
actually U. S. campuses are in a
real ﬁnancial crisis. Rising costs
of education have far outstrip-
ped its growing income (Sound
familiar?)

Libraries are spending five
times as much as in 1930; stu-
dent services such as psycholog-
ical testing and counseling have
helped to double administrative
costs. Well, we COULD do with-
out that “Do you think someone
is following you?” business!

The theme song of this com-
mittee might be “I’ve got plenty
of nothing." but nothing’s NOT
plenty for me. Oh well, things
are tough all over.

Poll Results Show Gals Wish
For More Time With Frotmen

Although the newly formed regu-
lation permitting men to entertain
women in the fraternity houses has
had only a short time to prove it-
self. the State College News felt that
taking a poll might help to enlight-
en the student in the understanding
of the plan. and some of the pro-
posed alterations.

Generally it was the opinion of
those interviewed that the idea was
a good one, and that the present
rules were enforceable. However.
they did feel that some extension of
the hours and the days should be
considered. The general sway of
ideas was that Friday. Saturday and
Sunday afternoons should be includ-
ed with those times that are at pres-
ent in use. and at a later date. if
the idea is possible. and proves
workable. adding even week nights.

As for the number of students
taking advantage of the girls' hours.

SA To Review
Finance Motion,
Attendancelssue

Today’s assembly agenda will con~
sist of consideration of the ﬁnancial
motion concerning the All—College
Revue, the motion to make non-
business meetings of SA non-com-
pulsory. and a motion calling for
the inclusion of a Good of the Order
meeting in assembly time at least
once ainonth. Student Council has
elected Sylvia Seminler '54 as Jun-
ior member of Election Commission
to fill the vacancy created by the
expiration of the term of Katherine
Sinclair '53 in December. Kathleen
Oberst ’54 was named alternate.
Next week‘s assembly will feature
an all-nuisical program presented
by the Music Department.

Wednesday night Council contin-
ued discussion on sending student
delgates to the Eastern States As-
sociation conference of colleges in
New York this March. It was decid~
ed last year to delete finances for
the conference from the Council
conference line since adequate out.-
lct for publicizmg ideas gained was
not. available. The Education De-
partment has since stated that time
for such publicity could be made
available in the Education classes.
As a result. it was decided to bring
the matter to SA in the form of a
financial motion to allow money for
sending two delegates to the con-
fercnce.

Myskania brought to the attention
of the Council the fact that it dc—
sires a vote of confidence from SA
on the representative type of gov-
ernment before it goes ahead with
its work on government. reorganiza-
tion.

ley Callahan ‘fi-i is the general chair-
man of the coffee hour.

the ﬂow of opinions was that. as one
student stated it. “The system has
not been in operation long enough
for the men and women to take ad-
vantage of it to the fullest degree."

There were very few of the stu-
dents interviewed who were at all op-
posed to the plan. One sorority girl
stated. “Frat members can't just
drop in with a date; the plan needs
more organization.”

One of the fraternity men. when
interviewed. stated that. “The sys-
tem has been in operation for too
short a time to draw any conclu-
sions . . . Interfraternity and Resi-
dence Councils will make any
changes or alterations in due time."

Students interviewed felt that the
people taking advantage of this
privilege were worthy of it and
should be allowed to conduct it as
beﬁts college students.
