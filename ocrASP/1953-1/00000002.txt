for the ﬁrst semester testing period. They have ac-
complished something which, to our way of think-
ing, is truly amazing: conﬂicts, which were in other
years so prevalent as to necessitate a special day
for the giving of those exams which often held stu-
dents over who were otherwise ﬁnished, have been
reduced from nearly 200 to include only eleven
courses and 36 students. This factor alone in in-
dicative of the careful planning which went into
preparing the schedule. In addition, with three two-
hour exams being held in a single day, up to one
thousand students will be taking tests at once—n0
small order when it comes to arranging times and
placesl

The program seems to have been arranged with
the interests of the student body in mind. Since
there will be an exceptionally long stretch between
Christmas and Easter vacations this year, it was
felt that time should be allowed to give all stu-
dents the opportunity of going home between se-
mesters. With the present schedule, SA will have
a full week off.

Regardless of how careful the planning, it is in-
evitable that some people will be hurt. It appears,
however, that the number of the dissatisﬁed should
be unusually small this semester. Therefore, our
appreciation for a difﬁcult job intelligently under-

which has compiled the schedule of examinations {

taken and successfully completed.

You Do M

It seems to be the opinion of Student Association
members that whatever they vote to do, someone
else will do the doings. Unfortunately, too many
someone elses add up to none. We refer to the
All-College Revue which SA decided it wished to
have in place of Big-Fours. Since that time, SA
has had approximately to think of scripts, write
them, and turn them in. Apparently none of these
processes has taken place, for, with the deadline
today, the script committee’s haul as we go to
press is zero. You asked for it! Now let's get with
it! Your responsibility doesn’t end with the cast-
ing of an afﬁrmative ballot if you want an All-
College Revue to materialize, to be anything more
that what you once accepted as a “good idea." To-
day you'll be asked to appropriate money from
surplus for this still-uncertain Revue. The motion
will undoubtedly be passed if you, SA, have not
changed your mind. for it would be rather sense—
less to vote in such a proposition and refuse to
back it financially. Likewise, it would be senseless
to dole out $300 to something for which you have
not even gotten over the basic hurdle—~the script.

Too Soon

As a result of an informal and formal poll con-
ducted by the News this week on the new ruling
concerning women in fraternity houses, it appears
that the plan has not been in operation a sufficient
time to allow thorough trial. It also appears that
there are no complaints of the system as it now
stands other than that it could be more extensive.
From our interviews we gained the opinion that
SA has approached the plan intelligently, not rash-
ly, as seemed to be the anticipation in some quar-
ters, and that the suggestions for extending the
hours and days included are based upon sincere
desire to make the system more convenient. not a
wish to rush into all-out lack of rules. We hope
that Residence Council and inter-Fraternity Coun~
cil, when they review the trial run of the system,
will see fit to take into consideration the desires
generally expressed.

How do you feel? Wonderful after
two memorable weeks of relaxing?
Terrible with only one week until
exams? One more week to study and
ﬁnish term papers, etc.

Let’s procrastinate a bit and take
a short mental journey! Where?
Out along the fourth dimension—
Time. Don't be afraid! It’s not a
physics ﬁeld trip but a little fantasy
starting New Year's and looking into
the future. It’s New Year's Day but
before we can see what the future
has in store for us we must prepare.

So following the good old New
Year’s custom. we take stock of the
past. What have we added to 1952—
to the lives of our associates—to
State College—to our selves? Aren't
there plenty of things we should
have done? Certainly we could have
ﬁlled up the SMILES Christmas
boxes, given more blood to the Red
Cross. paid up all our pledges to
Campus Chest. criticized our Stu-
dent Government more construct-
ively. Yet everything we did wasn't
uncommendable. We certainly gave
the frosh a rousing welcome. and
survived rushing with very little
hard feelings. There's plenty of
things to be thankful for also. One
thing is our Student Government.
Although it may not be completelv
satisfactory as it is. we must realize
that it is better than many in the
state. Tw0 colleges have absolutely
no form of Student Government and
most of the others are faculty dom-
inated. There are many other things
to be thankful for also—shorter reg-
istration lines. better cafeteria serv-
ice and a larger 00-01).

We have seen many changes in
‘52 also. Two new Deans. a new "cut"
system; yes, we can superficially
look back and say that all is quite
well and good. But let's move along

into the present and this time take
a more careful stock of our own
selves.

Have we worked diligently for all
those organizations of which we
claim to be members? Perhaps we've
been too selﬁsh. We have partici-
pated in organizations and produc-
tions just for our own self-glory.
This may be the much-sought after
source of State’s problems. Some of
us are only interested in self-glory
and few are interested in doing the
work. More workers and fewer
“wheels” may even be the solution
to our problems. Some way of com~
mending those individuals on the.
basis of their ability and effort rath-
er than on their smile and person-
ality is needed.

With this conclusion in mind we
move on; not as optimistically as
before but with steady courage. Our
next encounter is exams but we
hurry past them. Wait Just a min-
ute! We must remember that the
true reason for being here at State
is to study and we must study es-
pecially hard. for this knowledge is
not for ourselves alone but for all
those whom we shall teach and iii-
fluence.

The exams are over and a new
semester begins; and with it comes
new hope and new resolution. We
decide to do all of those things
which we didn't do in '52, we de-
cide that we will be an asset to
State College and in doing so we
will help our friends and inadvert-
antly ourselves. With this thought
we catch up to Time again and
swing back to the real present.

Just a parting thought on how to
make '53 better is this quotation
from the Sanskrit: "Look well to
this day."

To the Editor:

The day of Christmas vacation 1
left two big boxes from Whitney’s
on top of my luggage iii the Senior
girls' locker room. When I went to
pick them tip—big surprise! Lug-
gage—yes, boxes—rho!

i really felt very, very bad. The
boxes had nothing in them for Inc.
They were Christmas presents for
my niece and nephew. two red rain
slickcrs. Financially. I had knocked
myself out buying them. and there
I was~nothing for 11 rainy day, no
money. not even slickers.

Perhaps someone picked them up
by mistake. I prefer to think it was
an error because i hate to think of
sharing a locker room with slicker
snatchers. Christmas slicker snatch—
ers at that.

If anyone knows anything about
two red rain slickei's with hats. sizes
4 and 6. I'd sincerely appreciate
hearing about them.

REMEMBRANCES OF THE PAST

January—Shall we have our athletes running around
with an “A” on their backs or an “S” on their
chests?

February—Who‘s the slob who wouldn’t pay $.25 ad-
mission to the State basketball game for the
Knickerbocker NeWS beneﬁt fund?

March—What happened to Warren Austin?

April—Will Big Fours win out or will Dave succeed 111
doing away with another of State's traditions?

May—Which block got you elected?

June—Anyone pass?

July—What. poll the delegation again?

Augustr—Eat and sleep?

September—Many freshmen this year? Oh, a few _ , ,

October—Will a public apology be given or will u...

COMMON STATER be sued for libel?
November—Will somebody please figure out how to
elect the Soccer Queen?
December—Winterlude?

CLASS BANQUETS

If you have managed to hold on to your Christmas
money until now. it will soon be gone. Class Banquets
are tremendous—your stomach is full and your wal-
let is empty. But. what the devil—you only live once.

SCRIPTS???

If someone doesn’t get busy between now and llil(l~
night. there will be no All-College Revue and many
brave hearts will be broken. The time is short——yon
only have about 12 hours to get busy and start writ-
ing your ﬁrst big success.

REVIEW OF A REVUE

The frosh and the Juniors tried hard but someone
must have slipped up somewhere. Quite a few people
spent a lot of time and energy on “F‘lapperette” [as
it was called) but it flopped. We don’t condemn the
people who worked on the show for they did their
best. but we would like to throw a few rocks at the
half-wits who thought up the whole scheme.

THE RECOVERY ROOM

. . Has taken on some new faces. KB members.
unable ot live in their house because of lack of heat.
have taken up temporary residence there. Now Abe
Blattman is the only person at State College who can
get up at 8:09 and still make his 8:10.

A WORD TO THE WISE is SUFFICIENT

The time is drawing nigh for all good organization
Presidents to get busy on their budgets for next year.
The sooner you get them in the sooner we can start
ﬁghting over them. And a special note to all—let‘s
ﬁnd something new to delete this year besides the
key line.

70 DOLLARS WORTH

This Sunday. Brubacher Hall's main lounge will
play host to the third coffee hour of its career. Amid
the milling throngs. you might chalice to meet your
favorite English instructor or your arch enemy from
the History department over a steaming cup of “java.”
If you don't have any exams to study for. or any last
minute term papers to write, drop down to Briibach-
er Sunday afternoon and have the time 01' your life.
One lump or two?

DON'T FORGET

The ED Plays coming to Page Hall next Tuesday.
we hear that they are the best of many a year . . .
To study hard for your exams and to thank the ad-
ministration for cutting down conflicts to less than
20 . . . Seniors. to hand in your TPB folders . . .

A I’ARTING THOUGHT

We hope that the individuals who will be writing
this column ncxt semester will endeavor. as we have.
to use it. ior constructch rather than destructive ends.
We have enjoyed writing this column: we hope you
have enjoyed reading it. To our succes>ors we leave
as our final quote the words of Sir William Drum»
mend . . .

"He who will not reason. is a bigot; he who cannot
Is a fool; and he who dares not is a slave."
