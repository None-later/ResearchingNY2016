In my'Opinlon, Miss Doyle should
be thankful that the audience at
the Tuesday night AD productions
was in as receptive mood as its ap-
plause seemed to indicate. Miss
Doyle should be complimented for
what came across the footlights as
a job of directing. The action ap-
peared natural and well-planned,
and the basic interpretation was
valid, the cast was inadequate. Miss
Hopkins fought a losing battle to
build and- sustain what could have
been a profound mood of human
tragedy. She was aided, at times, by
her husband, the tyrannical sea cap-
tain. whose tendency to fall in and
out of his role made his over-all
performance insufficient. As for the
set, one person mentioned to me
that she expected someone to start
throwing darts at the ‘porthole."
Three bells for the props committee!

After a much needed cigarette, I
regained my seat to be entertained
by one of the most well-done com-
edies of the year. Miss Payne ap-
parently put a great deal of plan-
ning into her play. and it really
paid off. Every bit of action was
precision timed. The cast was well
aware of how to play comedy, and
a special hall to Donald Lein whose
only criticism might be that a not-
so-slow delivery of lines would have
made him funnier. An imaginative
set, well-timed lights, and an alert
person on sound effects made the
entire production delightful.

Dr. James Childers, Professor of
Modern Languages. has been invit-
ed to attend a conference to discuss
the Role of Foreign Languages in
the American School, which has
been called by the U. S. Commis-
sioner of Education, Earl J. Mc—
Grath.

The conference will be almost en-
tirely devoted to the discussion of
the place of foreign languages in
elementary schools. Specialists agree
that it would be better not to crowd
a foreign language into just a High
School experience. They feel that a
more functional approach is needed.

The conference will be held in
Washington, D. 0.. on January 15,
16, and 17.

Marvin J. Pryor, Instructor
in Physics, will lecture at the Amer—
ican Association of Physics Teach-
ers national annual conference
which will be held at Harvard Uni-
versity on Saturday, January 24.
1953. Pryor will speak on “Pre-
senting Virtual Objects by Demon—
stration."

Also attending the conference from
State will be Arthur P. Jones, Miss
Anne Oliver, and Charles Andrews.
of the Physics Department.

Several members of the College
Department of Modern Languages
attended the sixty-seventh annual
meeting of the Modern Language
Association Meeting in Boston this
past December 27-29. Those who at—
tended arc: Stewart Denslow, Miss
Annette Dobbin, Miss Sara Mac-
Gonagle, Edwin Munroe. Edward
Shaw, and James Childers.

Dr. Minnie Scotland, Professor of
Biology, took part in the Massachu—
setts Audubon Society's Annual Bird
Census during the past vacation.

Woman, W!“ Now

By JOAN NEWMAN

 

In WAA basketball, which takes
place every Tuesday and Wednes-
day nights and Saturday mornings,
several scheduled games have been
played. There is much laxity in co-
operation and appearance at the
games. ’1h.s is especially among the
Fresh girls.

Since the class of '56 seems to be
the great rah rah class, making a
good showing at every other activ-
ity, we wonder why this should 'be.
Sports are good fun, but if you Sign
up for an intramural team your
prompt attendance is naturally ex-
pected. This inconsiderate attitude
is unfair to the girls who want to
play and to those who make up the
schedules.

Swimming still continues at Jew-
ish Community Center on Tuesday
nights. Where are the girls who
want co-ed swimming? Better start
to practice for good form now as
starting next semester eo-ed swim-
ming will go into effect. for a trial
period.

Is anyone interested in spending
a weekend at Camp Johnson? For
those who don‘t already know, Camp
Johnson is a log cabin situated about
twenty—seven miles from here.
Think of it girlsl—a weekend away
from it all where you can rest and
relax, plan and cook your own meals,
and go ice skating and skiing. If you
don‘t have skis, they will be avail-
able for you at the cabin.

WAA says that mixed ping-pong
doubles are soon to appear on the
agenda. They will be matched so
that a boy and a girl will be part-
ners. There will also be tumbling
for girls in Page Gym every Tues—
da' and Thursday night.

Gripe of the week—it's about time
that the bystanders realized that
harrangin; the refs is not part of
the game. There are only a few
g.r.s who are constantly called on
to ref and for several times each
week. Let's consider them and show
a little praise a decent “Thank you."

Congratulations to Pete Telfer for
being chosen “All State Goalie."

744 State fine

By BOB ASHFIELD

 

After watching some of the Intra-
mural contests lately, I feel it is al-
most necessary that someone set
some of the players straight on what
one means by basketball. It is not a
contest of mud-slinging against the
officials as some of the guys appar-
ently think. As of late. even the
guys on the bench have been giv-
ing a continuous razzing to the refs
from the opening whistle. And they
think that is portraying good sports-
manship!

It is the general concensus of
cp nion that when a guy beefs to a
official, he is generally trying to
pass along the blame for his own
mistakes. It a guy played smart
basketball, he would never commit
a violation or be in position for one
to be called against him. Naturally
this is as impossible to achieve as
perpetual motion. If the officials
made half as many mistakes as
some of the players who complain
the most about bad calls. it just
wouldn‘t be a basketball game.

Professional or otherwise, all of-
ficials are only human and it is this
that makes the game interesting.
This is partly the reason why the
crow’s nest system of refereeing did
not stick, because it cut down too
greatly the chalice of human error.
The intramural officials realize
that they do not have professional
training, but the players don't. In
comparison the majority of the
players haven't had college varsity
experience either and therefore
they perform awkwardly and beef
consistently. How many varsity ball
plajcrs do you see arguing or rid-
ing the referee . . . not very many
because they have learned to con-
trol themselves. They realize they
only look foolish and are reflecting
their own ignorance when they pro-
test a decision.

Intramural basketball could again
become a real sport if and when the
guys play the game without por-
traying their ignorance by com-
plaining.

Mat Men Work Out
In Preparation For Bout

Coach Joe Garcia is stepping up
drill for his wrestling club in prep-
aration for its first meet of the sea-
son. The State mat men will meet
Darrow Prep here in the Milne gym
on Saturday afternoon, January 24,
at 2 p. m.

The squad this year is built
around a few veterans and a small
number of new candidates.

Phil Billings and Ray Wolfe are
the two lightweight veterans. Both
boys wrestle in the 137 lb. class.
Rey Ncgus is the only returning 147
pounder. Hank Feurback, one of the
high point men last year, will be
at 157 lbs. Bob Dreher. an up and
coming Soph, wrestles at 167 lbs.

Among the newcomers, Rebel
Hoclnnuth leads off in the 123 lb.
class. Frank Prindlc. who has shown
a lot. of speed and aggressiveness,
wrestles in the 137 lb. class. Tom
Fagan. another novice, is in the 157
lb. class. So far. Walt Barbash and
Brad Briilcn hold down the heavy~
weight positions. Both boys are in
the 177 lb. class. Coach Garcia is
very plcased wth these new men.
They show 11 lot of spirit, and are
rcaly raring to go against Darrow.

More men are needed if wrestling
is to become a varsity sport here at
Slate. The club works out every aft-
crnoon at 3:45 in the Milne gym.
Anyonc who is interested in this
sport should come to the practices,
or contact Coach Garcia at his of-
flcc. Anyone who is interested
shouldn't hesitate because of luck
of cxpcrlcncc.

Three Leading Teams Unchanged
As IM Cogers Resume Contests

The Intramural basketball stand-
ings have remained the same as
they were before Christmas vaca-
tion as Potter Club, L.O.F.B.P., and
Summit House still lead the A, B.
and C Leagues respectively. How-
ever, the leaders are being threat-
ened by many up~and-coming
teams. Sigma Lambda Sigma and
the Ind ans in the A League. the
White Eagles of the B League, and
Kappa Beta in the 0 League have
turned in some well-played ball
games and promise to be tough as
the season goes on.

Wednesday night in the A Lea-
gue. a tall and powerful Sigma
Lambda Sigma team trounced

were unable to take any rebounds
from the SIS trio of Howlett, Hil-

Soccer Players
Receive Honors

The State College soccer
squad made a tremendous step
toward gaining the recognition
it deserves after last. season’s
successful campaign as three
men were named to the All New
York Soccer squad.

Pete Telfer, after only two
years of soccer experience, was
chosen as first team goalie. This
is a reflection on both the excel-
lent coaching and diligence of
“Telf.ll

Dean Strickland, Tom King
and Jack Hughes were award-
ed for their consistently fine
play throughout the last season
with honorable mention on the
All State aggregation.

There will be a meeting of
Coaches and all Area district
chairmen In N.Y.C. January 17.
18, 19, where All-American can-
didates will be decided upon
and announced.

Individuals who are picked as
members of the All-American
team receive the highest honor
that can be bestowed upon an
intercollegiate soccer player in
the United States.

Schonberg Sets Record

In League C, Summit House set
a new scoring record for the sea-
son while blast'ng Sayles B, 93-25.
Sharp-eyed Arnie Schonberg also
set a new individual scoring record
in netting 46 points. This effort puts
Schonberg well ahead in the indiv-
idual scoring race for the campaign

Wednesday night in League B,
Vanderzee Hall walloped the Rebels

a fine scoring effort of 22 points for

LOFBP, Summit House Win

Last Monday night's schedule pro-
duced two thrillers, one between the
White Eagles and LOFBP (League

roster in defeating the White
Eagles, 31-21. while the hustling
Summit House team nipped Kappa
Beta, 45-38. Abel Blattman took
down scoring honors for the game
with 21 points, but Summit House
showed that they can win without
Schonberg as Bill Rebel sparked
them with 1'7 counters, followed by
LaClair with 10.

The LOFBP-White Eagles was a
fine exhibition of defensive basket-
ball, as the “old pro,” Bob Brown.
led hs victorious team with nine
points. Holman Shwarz paced the
losers with 8 points. In other games
before vacation. the Indians beat
Sigma Lambda Sigma. 48-34 (Lea-
gue A), and in League C the hap-
less Sayles B team lost two more
games, to the Rousers by 32-21, and
to Kappa Beta by 51-35.

  
 
 

 

  
 

 
 
  

Face Potsdam
Tonight, USMC
3:30 P. M. Sat.

Hoping to achieve the winning
ways again, State’s Purple and Gold
quintet will play host to the Pots-
dam Teachers tonight ln Page Hall.
So far this year State has played 2
contests at home and has obtained
my v.ctories in both of them and
hope for a repeat over Potsdam.

Potsdam, although unimpressive
against other teams this year can
be explosive anytime as long as
their ace, Van Orman, is in the
lineup, as well remembered from
last year when the Statesman were
upset by this same squad. Van Or-
man can drive and can hit from
outside. which makes a deadly com-
bination. This year he has also been
using a one hander from in close.
which has been very effective. If
Van Orman is on, the Statesman
will have to go all out to keep a
clean slate at home.

Maritime Here Tomorrow

Maritime Academy will furnish
the opposition on Saturday after-
noon for the Feds. Game time is
scheduled for 3:30 p. in. State will
be trying to avenge the initial de-
feat of the year suffered at the
hands of the Marines. Maritime has
good height with Captain Sven Nes-
lon being the big man at 6’ 4”. In
the first meeting of these two teams
the rebounding strength of the Mar-
itimemen was one of the key factors
in State's defeat. Jack Belton, hard-
driving backeourt man, was their
biggest scoring threat and he sank
23 counters in the winning effort
a alnst State. Maritime being used
to romping on a big court may have
to al.er their style of play in the
game tomorrow, and therefore, may
hamper their effectiveness. Regard-
less. State will force the Marltimers
to be top notch to post a win.

In the final game before vacation
State had their 3-game win streak
snapped when New Haven was able
to obtain a 60-59 victory over the
men from State. This was also an
afternoon contest. State maintain-
ed a narrow margin for nearly
three quarters. but New Haven's re-
peated scoring from outside couldn't
be stopped. Part of State’s failure
can be attributed to the fact that
they couldn't hit from the outside.
Bill Walker, state's leading scorer.
was held to 7 points, his lowest out-
put this year. John Centra and Nels
LaRoc led State's scoring attack for
the most part with 13 an) 14 points
respectively.

Albany vs. l'lattsburg Next Week

One week from tomorrow night.
Plattsburg State will make their
first appearance of the year in Page
Hall. Plattsburq and Albany have
been nrch rivals for some time. and
a game between the two usually
l‘l'C‘ltt‘S great interest among the
meters from both schools. Platts-
burg fans are still buzzing over the
sensational shot by Bill Walker last
year wh'ch sent the game into over-
time and cost P.S.T.C. a victory.

Albany conquered Plattsburg
twice last year which means a win
is 11 must for them to retain some
of their prestige. P.S.T.C. will not
bring a too impressive record with
them to Albany, but they have been
playing some tough teams. Jim
Sears. their uce, has been hitting
consistently th’s year for the Red
and White and piled up 35 against
Oswego.
