Regents Council
Suggests Change

At a meeting of the Regents Advi-
sory Council on the Readjustment
of High School Education last Tues-
day. a report and recommendations
were made concerning the reason
for students' dropping out of high
school.

Results of the survey show the
main reasons 44 per cent of high
school students drop out is retarda-
tion and low intelligence. These
causes were reported by 77 per cent
of the high schools canvassed.

Recommendations were: compre-
.iensive guidance programs that
would adapt teaching technique to
the differences in individual ability
and a change in the curriculum that
would reflect the socio-economic
changes in the world.

Students also succumbed to ten-
sion. discipline and other unhappy
experiences besides other reasons
such as: the lure of a job. attitude
of parents. dislike of school, social
maladjustment and broken homes.

The council also recommended
that schools make use of work-
study program.

Poll Reveals Student Pessimism
Concerning Prospects For Peace

Recently, the Associated Colleg-
iate Press has taken a national poll
of student opinion about the
chances for peace. The majority of
students were pessimistic. College
students have little hope of either
a speedy end to the Korean war or
of peace between Russia and the
United States.

Students across the nation were
asked: “Do you think the Korean
war will be over within six
months?" Five percent of those
asked replied “yes.” 82 percent re-
plied "no." 10 percent had no
opinion and three persons had
other opinions.

Students were also asked: "How
peaceful settlement of differences
do you feel about chances for a
between Russia and the United
States?’ Only three percent thought
the chances were good, 27 percent
thought the chances were fair. 54
percent thought the chances were
poor, 12 percent thought there was
no chance, and four percent had
no opinion. In a Student Opinion
poll taken one year ago the same
question was asked. At that time

only 43 percent of those interviewed
sail ‘chances are poor.”

Most students lay both the K0-
rean war and the Cold War at Rus-
sin's doorstep. "Russia is not look-
ing for peace but Power," says 8.
jun or from Mount Mary College,
Milwaukee.

Thorc who feel there is still a
chance for peace. tend to pin their
hopes on: A revolution in the So-
viet Union and its satellites; Soviet
fear of Western power; U. S. “pa-
tence and diplomacy;” and Eisen-
hower.

A coed at Trinity College, D. C.,
sums up the feeling of many stu-
dents when. having granted there's
a chance for peace. adds, "But it
will take a miracle."

Guard lnnovstes
Reserve Group 4

In addition to the present reserve
units operating in the Albany area,

there is now functioning a Coast ’

Guard Organized Reserve Port Se-
curity Unit.

This is the only Coast Guard unit
in this area, and has a quota of
seven officers and forty-four enlist-
ed men; the quota will be expanded
if there is sufficient interest to war-
rant it.

Drills are to be held on Thursday
evenings from 8 to 10:15 p. m., at
the Naval Reserve Training Center.
off Quay street, behind the Albany
railroad station.

"This program is of vital interest
to young men considering the Coast
Guard as the service of their
choice, stated LCDR James S. Stev-
ens, of West Copake, a teacher at
the Roeliff Jansen Central School.
Hillsdale. “Regular Coast Guard re-
cruiting quotas have been so dras-
tically reduced as to cause a backlog
of more than six months delay be-
fore enlistments are accepted. How-
ever, a young man can insure a bil-
let for himself in the Coast Guard
by enlisting now in its reserve, and
transferring to active duty in the
Coast Guard when such action is
indicated by his draft board."

Men in the unit will be expected
to participate in the drill each
Thursday evening, for which they
will receive a full day‘s pay, which
will be computed according to the
rating which they hold. The men
will study military drill, seaman-
ship, nautical nomenclature, and
other courses in specialized train-
mg.

Cameo”: Statesmen Seek Vengeance In Page;

Fed—Juniors 'Aim For Third Consecutive

By ABEL BLATTMAN

 

‘The Albany newspapers ran an
obscure tid-bit of news the other
day, that was lost somewhere on
some back page. Its obscurity in the
paper in no way lessened the impact
that it will have on State College
as an institution, and on us. and
on future student bodies of this col-
lege. In essence the item said that
the request for an athletic building
for State College has been turned
down for the present, and will prob-
ably not be brought up again for a
couple of years.

Assuming that the great god State
acts at its typical sloth-like Speed,
it will probably be four or five years
before the legislators start talking
about the request again. We’re be-
ginning to think that if an active.
interested student body gave the
problem of facilities as much, and
as careful consideration as was af-
forded the football question, some
definite progress would be made.
Whether this is a matter for Stu-
dent Council to work on, or whe-
ther any action should be sponta-
neous is an academic question. We
do think that something should be
done . . . and soon.

Had a visit from a former sports
editor of the State College News.
Ensign Harvey Milk, who during his
stay here at State. achieved the dis-
tinction of becoming a very contro-
versial ﬁgure. His comments. after
spending two years away from col-
lege were that State supplied an
excellent background for his school—
ing in the service, that although he
no longer is keenly interested in
student activities he is happy to see
that college life hasn’t undergone
any great changes.

Last weekend two names were
conspicuously absent from the State
box scores in the tilts with Oneonta
and Utica. To answer any and all
questions as to the reasons for this
absence . . . the two guys, whose
names need not be mentioned, step—
ped out of line and the situation
was handled commendably by Mr.
Hathaway, who. we feel, has the
team’s best interests at heart. We're
sure also, that now that the pres-
sure of exams is all over, and ten—
sion is back to normal, that the
team will realize its high potential.

JV’s Cops Two
ln Away Games

Wednesday night in the IM
Leagues only two games were
played as the Rousers forfeited to
Summit House in the C.‘ League. In
League A, Sigma Lambda Sigma
walloped the Potterillies. 54-26, as
Gus Berleth went wild with 23
points. Rod Hilsinger and Red Mil-
ler chipped in with 13 and 12 re-
spectively while Don Canonica
hooped 8 for the losers. LOFBP or
the B League squeezed out a 43-37
decision over the River Rats with
Rutley, Wander. and Hausner net-
ting 10, 9. and 8 points respective-
ly. Big Fran Streeter led the River
Rats with 12 points.

Grads, Indians Look Good

IM play at the end of last se-
mester saw the Grads of the C
League move closer to first place as
they rolled over Kappa Beta and
the Rousers. They trounced the
Rousers 64-10 as Sausvile netted 22
points and Wakin 17. The Grads
had four men in double digits as
they blasted KB 56-23.

The indians have been hot in the
A League, beating the Potterlillies
and Sayles A. Led by Bob Strauber
with 17 points and with their start-
ing five in double figures, the In-
dians clobbcred the Potterillies. 61-
26. Don Canonica hooped 12 for the
losers. Ben Button's 14 points paced
the Indians to a 40-26 victory over
Sayles A. while Bob Smith hooped
12 in a losing cause. Also in the A
League. lanky Dick Kircli hit 30
points as the Raiders rolled over
the Unbeatable 5, 63—25.

Rodgers Paces VanDerzre

In the B League, Vanderzee play-
ed two close games, beating the
Finks 33-24. and dropping one to
the White Eaglesby 38-33. Against
the Finks. Fran Rodgers sparked
VanDcrzec with 12 points, while
Frank Fay also had 12 for the
losers. Rodgers again led VanDer-
zee with 12 points in their losing
effort against the potent White
Eagles with 11. Also in the B
League, the Finks gained a point
in the standings as the River Rats
forfeited to them.

lM Basketball Resumes

 

3004'»

By DOTTIE MEHAN

 

WAA didn't waste any time get-
ting started on a new term with
basketball intramurals. The ﬁrst day
of this semester saw four games
scheduled.

Newman gets credited with a win
because of a forfeit on AE Phi's part.
Beta Zeta and Phi Delta’s "Atleds"
(backwards, that's “Deltas,” you
know.» vied for honors in the sec-
ond contest. BZ held the "Atleds"
easily, thanks to better individual
athletes and really great team work
and passing excellence that isn't
always present on State College
courts. By the beginning of the
third quarter, the team was handl-
ing the ball with that smooth ease
that makes most 82. games a pleas-
ure to watch. The score was 15-4 in
Bz’s favor.

Chi Sigma Theta faced Brubacher
for the third contest. a slow moving
one, in spite of the close score: 21-
18 for Chi Sig. The one really bright
spot in this game was the cheering
of Pranitis and Sinclair from the
sidelines.

The KD team (or should we say,
the Pearson-Richter team?) walked
over Gamma Kap and ended with a
score of 22-6.

It was interesting to compare the
styles of the two reputedly “good”
teams that played Tuesday night:
KD and BZ. BZ has a lot of good
athletes playing for them. Marge
Liddell, Angle Kavanaugh. and Barb
Devitt, to name a few, all know
their way around a. basketball court.
However, none of them seems to
stand out particularly in the game;
they all seem to subordinate them-
selves for the team. On the other
hand, the KD team seems to sub-
ordinate itself to the Pearson-Rich-
ter combination whose set shots are
amazingly accurate.

Donna Hughes makes a plea for
all swimmers at the Jewish Com-
munity Center to turn in the white
cards at the desk, and not to take
them home. If anyone now has these
white cards in his possession, please
give them to Donna.

Maintains Lead

No change was brought about by
the A League Intramural Bowling
competition in the Rice Bowling
Alleys on last Tuesday afternoon. In
the initial match the APA quintet
drew a forfeit from the Kappa Beta
five, but it was not quite enough to
boost them back- into the top spot_
which they were knocked out of not
long ago by the up and coming Van-
Derzee team. The VanDerzee ﬂve
was bowled over by the Thurlow out-
ﬁt on Tuesday. The Rousers drew a
bye. Little Joe Duran rolled the high
triple for the week with a 492 for
VanDerzee. Thurlow Hall’s Ben
Tucker had the high single of the
day as he rolled a 194.

The fact that the APA quintet,
which started off the pin season in
top form and has lost none of its
prowess. has dropped to the second
place position in the league stand-
ings is an indication that the com-
petition in League A has gotten con-
siderably stronger all of the time.
This fact is also emphasized as Van-
Derzee has taken over the top spot
and yet they were defeated Tuesday
by Thurlow Hall.

With the playoffs coming up in
the middle of March, we would like
to make a prediction. even though
we may be climbing out on a limb.
In our opinion VanDerzee. APA, and
Thurlow Hall will certainly be
among the contenders of League A
while it seems that only these three
are in the running for the top spot
in the League. SLS and the Com-
muters are fighting it out for the
honors in B League while the Misﬁts
may be considered as a long shot.

aminations. the statesmen took to
the road for two big games over the
weekend, in Oneonta on Friday, and
then Utica Saturday night. As a re-
sult they took it on the chin twice
and made their record for the sea-
son 6 wins as against 5 loses. A lit-
tle man named McCarthy and a big
man named Green combined their
eﬁorts to do the most damage for
Oneonta. They contributed more
than half of their team's 74 points
State netted 61 for the night. The
long lay off and the long trip really
took their toll, as Oneonta contin-
uously connected on the fast-break
combination to pile up an advant-
age. State trailed all the way and
with about five minutes to go less-
ened the gap to four points, but
that was it for the night as Oneon-
ta was not to be denied a victory.
Mcﬁarthy and Green had 19 points
eac .

It took the Utica Pioneers and
Rudy Valenzi a ﬁve-minute over-
time period before they could finish
off the game Statesman aggregation.
After trailing all the way, except for
two brief moments. State knotted
the score at 62-all as the ﬁnal buzz-
er sounded. In the overtime period.
Utica again grabbed a quick lead
and maintained it until the end, the
ﬁnal score being 78—74. Valenzi led
his squad with 21 points.

McDonald Iligh For Weekend
Gerry McDonald furnished the
bulk of the scoring punch both
nights for State as he sank 16 point-
ers against Oneonta and finished off
the weekend with a ﬂashy 22-point
production against Utica. Mac has
been showing promising signs all
year in practice, but this is the ﬁrst
time that he has been able to really
get going in actual competition.

Captain Bob Tuber has accounted
for the most total points for the
season with 121_ but Bill Walker
still maintains the lead in average
points scored per game with 12,
since he has been in fewer games.
