Gibson Offers

Instructor Course

There are still openings available
in the year course of Driver Educa-
tion for those students who already
have obtained their driver’s license
and who wish to become driver
train'ng instructors, reports Thom-
as Gibson, Professor of Health. Stu-
dents wishing to be instructors must
be licensed drivers for at least two
years. This first semester of the
course has a curriculum of materials
and methods in driving. The second
semester. consisting of practice
teach'ng, will be given next year.

The two classes for beginners and

instructors are already filled, Gib-
son advises.

The beginning course does not
carry any credit hours. The course
for instructors carries two hours
credit.

The purpose of the courses in
Driver Education is to prepare
teachers in both classroom and be-
hind-the-wheel phases of driving.

State Succumbs

To Coiomities

How many ladders did you
walk under? Did you see any
black cats cross your path?
Have you had any sort of bad
luck today? Or are you one of’
those people who prefer to re-
main in bed on Friday, the
13th?

For a change this is one time
we won‘t thank God it’s Fri-
day. Equally anxious professors
will harry state students with
upside-down curved tests. To-
day’s assembly agenda will con-
sist of a “For the ill of the or-
ganization" meeting; Statesmen
will forget to mail their Valen-
tines; Varsity will win a game;
the date rooms in Brubacher
will be shut down for repairs;
roast pork will be served in all
the dorms; and for you who
stayed in bed today. classcs will
be held tomorrow. In short, this
place will be known as Calamity
College.

Your troubles won't be over at
midnight either. March brings
another Friday the 13th.
