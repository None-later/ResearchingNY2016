Cupid To Trap
Guileless Men

What’s your opinion? Is it a.
day to be anticipated? 0r its it
Just another day—a day of sen-
timental “gush”? However you
may feel, tomorrow is definitely
.here to stay, because . . .

1'Tomorrow, the males will be
ﬂooded with laced and t'rilled
cards from State’s gals. Dan
Cupid will punctuate the air
with “potioned-arrowa” to sink
into the hearts of the unsus-
pecting 1?) stronger sex.

Beware men, of this subtle
flattery:

“A little flattery

Now and then,

Makes husbands

Out of single men.”

And gals, if you don’t trap
that certain “him” tomorrow,
don’t worry, you’ll have another
chance to get “him” on next
Sadie Hawkin’s Day.

.44 14/361 It

By ABEL BLATTMAN

 

At the onset of the current varsi-
ty hoop campaign we climbed way
out on a limb. We mentally evalu-
ated each man on the squad, and
the team as a whole, comparing the
present squad to State College out-
ﬁts of previous years, and to other
squads this institution has met on
the court. Our estimation of the
team’s potential was very high, and
we still stick by it. We predicted
tremendous success this season. In
essence we predicted that the team
would realize these high potentiali-
ties. But. to say that this is not the
case would be a gross understate-
ment.

We certainly do not Wisn to chas-
tise the team for one poor perform-
ance. as the best teams suffer on
"off nights," but in dropping four
out of the last ﬁve, (excluding the
Willimantic game, which took place
after we went to press.) we think
that something is wrong. We're not
b.amlng the ofﬁciating, which has
been better than average this year;
we are not blaming Coach Hatha-
way to whom the team‘s poor show-
ing must be a great disappointment;
the entire blame lies with the team
itself. Something is lacking. The
guys get out on the court and go
through the motions. but seem life-
less. The rough house, fast break
type of ball that was evident early
in the year is gone. Walker's driv-
ing, spirited type of play seems to
be a thing of the past. The ball
handling is no longer sharp and
classy. In Saturday‘s game with New
haven many baskets were literally
kicked away. and thrown away.
Walking violations were too numer—
ous. Rebounding was pathetic. De-
fense was mediocre and offense was
practically a blank. This applies to
the Maritime game as well. Grant-
ed that the team may have been
outclassed. but it was certainly no
reason to roll over and play dead
at the end of the ﬁrst quarter. In-
stead of ﬁve men in a fast break as
in the last two home games two or
three might get up enough steam to
run the length of the court.

The guys potentially are as good
as they ever were, but the joy of
playing the game seems to be gone.
As good as a team may be, the men
must want to win, ﬁght to win. and
enjoy the competition. in order to
meet with success. When and if the
squad br;aks out of the doldrums
they are now in, and want to play
ball again. we are sure it will realize
its possibilities. Until then we'll just
have to sit and suffer.

Freshmen, Gremlins
To Stage Swim Meet

The Sophomore challenge for a
swim meet to be held at Public Bath
Number Three will be taken up by
the ﬂash next Thursday night at
7:30.

Dona Hughes and DeWitt Combs

Bob Coan. Sophomore class presi-
dent announces that the team has
been practicing for the past four
weeks at the Jewish Community
Center. The final try—outs will be
held this Tuesday night at 7:30 at
the Center.

Bea Engelhardt and Sam Krchni-
ak are the freshman captains. Miss
Eiigiehardt posted the notice on the
‘50 bulletin board and the fresh
quota is now filled, The fresh have
also been practicing for the past
few weeks.

The women will conn'cic in n
sidestroke, back stroke. free style
and crawl. There is also to bc a
novelty race called the Cnndlc. in
which contestants will swim with a
lighted candle the length of the

finish line first with the candle still
lit.

State Mat Men

Pin Troy Group
In Contest Here

Tonight at 7:00 p. m. in the Mil-
ne gym, the State Wrestling Club
will go after its third straight win
of the season. State's grapplers will
face a tough club from the Sche-
nectady _,YMCA.

Friday, February 6, the State club
handed a Troy YMCA outfit a 25
to 5 trouncing. This bout was the
clubs' best appearance to date.

The only loser in State's lineup
was Walt Barbash, 192 lbs. Steve
Brylewskl. 190 lbs. pinned Walt in
4:05.

Wolfe, Fem-back Win With Pins

Winners for the State mat men
included Ray Wolfe and Hank Feur-
back with pins. and Frank Prindle.
Lee Negus, Bob Dreher, Tom Fagan,
and Phil Billings with decisions.
Coach Joe Garcia is plaesed with
the way these boys are shaping up.
The first year men. Frank Prindle
and Tom Fagan are shaping up into
fine intercollegiate wrestlers.

The squad has been strengthened
by three new members. Bob Schu-
mann and Stud ’I'heohary, both vet-
erans from last year. and Dick Sor-
enson. a frosh. have started to work
out.

The bout against Schenectady
should prove to be a real contest.
Everyone is invited to come to the
gym to watch the club in action. If
you haven‘t seen an intercollegiate
wrestling match. here is your chance
to see two good teams in action.

Three new managers of WAA
sports were chosen at the last coun-
cil meeting on Wednesday. Teresa
"Tush" Barber will now help Barb
Law in the capacity of co-director
of swimming. When springtime
comes, Pat Zylko and Lois Reltman
will be in charge of softball.

Invitations have been extended to
State girls to take part in various
basketball playdays. Russell Sage
and Skidmore Colleges have planned
events for March 21.

Plans are already in the making
for the WAA-sponsored basketball
“rally” to be held for the Albany
area high schools. This is one of
WAA’s extra-special good activities.
we feel. since it has benefits for
everyone involved. It is particularly
advantageous from the public rela-
tions standpoint; something we get
awfully sick of hearing about. but
still an issue that this college has
to face. When an organization from
this campus goes out of the realm
of the school itself to plan some-
thing for the community, it is bound
to reﬂect favorable attention on the
college.

Here are the team standings in
bowling as of last Thursday.

Rolls 218 High

Leabue B in the Intramural Bowl-
ing competition at Rice Alleys is
beginning to look like the Intra-
mural football season did on Bever-
wyck Park this past Fall. In last
Tuesday's scheduled matches there
was not one game that went all the
way without a forfeit.

'i-he Commuters picked up a four
point forfeit from the Finks who
failed to appear at the Alleys. The
K-Bobbles also failed to put a five
man team on the Aleys lost four
points to the Misfits. In the SIS-
Potter Club match, SLS and Potter
split on a forfeit basis.

McCormick Rolls Season High

The bright spot of B League
action on Tuesday was “Red” Mc-
Cormick's single game of 218 which
is the high single of the season.
Congratulations on a good game.

APA swept four points from the
VanDerzee quintet 2069-2009. Steve
Serniak rolled a 470 to pace APA
while Joe Duran chipped in with a
413 for the losing cause.

Mistake in Standings Rectified

This reporter would like to make
a public apology to the teams in A
League for the printing of the wrong
standings of that league in last
week's issue of the State College
News. Our standings had the teams
in the following order: VanDerzee,
APA, Thurlow Hall. Kappa Beta.
and the Rousers. .

The standings of League A in-
cluding both last week's and this
week's matches are as follows:

Wednesday night. in the IM
Leagues The LOFB of the B League
and the White Eagles of the C
League took another step toward
the first place positions of their re-
spective loops by posting decisive
wins over the tough clubs. The
standings of the leagues are un—
known at present since the IM co-
inanagers have not posted a list of
standings since last semester.

The Legion of Forgotten Bail
Players rolled over an ineffective
Alpha Pi Alpha quintet. 38-29. in a
defensive battle. Ex-State Varsity
player Bob Brown led the L.O.F‘.B.P.

game scheduled between Sayles B
and the Grads resulted in a forfeit
victory for the Grads in the C

were the high-scoring effort of the
Potterliilies-Sayles A game, but
Sayles took the nod, 55-43 as four
men hit double digits. Chuck Der-

men with 13 points apiece. In the

There were three forfeits last Sat—

which resulted in two teams. the
Unbeatable Five and the Raiders. to
be dropped from intramural com-

which is just beginning to hit its
stride and which should be near
the top of its league.

Probably at their lowest ebb oi
the season, State College's court-
sters will travel North tomorrow in
hopes of catching fire against
Plattsburg. Plattsburg. who is al-
ways tough for State will be all the
more so on their home court. Platts-
burg fans will settle for nothing but
a victory and they will depend on
Jim Sears. Doug Meahne. and Ken
Humiston to pack the winning
punch for them.

J.V. Men to be Brought Up

As it stands now the probability
that Captain Bob Tabor, John Al-
laslo. and John Zongrone will see
action this weekend is slim. “Tabe”
has been out all week and the other
two men became victims late in the
week of the worst enemy that State
has faced this season, the flu bug.
Other members of the squad have
been afflicted, but not as seriously
as yet. Coach Hathaway will be de-
pendent on Junior Varsity strength
this weekend to bolster the limping
Peds. Who these men will be is un-
decided as yet. but in Bob DeMich-
iell. De Combs, Bob Sage. Sig
Smith. and Gerry Cline, is plenty
of varsity material.

in several weeks. failed to come
through as they were downed by
New Haven for the second time this
year. This time the Feds were more
than edged losing by 6 points 78-
72. The Statesmen never held a lead
as Bernie Pillchowskl hooped one
to put New Haven in front early in
the game. Pilichowski didn’t stop
there as he went wild scoring 16 out
of his team’s 18 points in the first
quarter. This spree was enough to
decide the game. Pillchowskl could
only muster 5 more points the rest
of the night, but his teammate Ing-
lese took over and tossed in 24
points to lead in that department.

~ Nels LaRoe made some what of a

comeback and tossed in 15 points
to lead State.
Outside Shooting Stands Out

On Thursday, February 5, State
outfought and outhustied the Wil-
limantic Willies 77-74. the same
squad which they met yesterday on
Page. Bill Walker got back into the
lineup and accounted for 23 points
to aid the cause. Willimantic, a
great team to hit from outside. had

— to take a backseat to the boys from

Albany. Four times in a row, when
State came downcourt, Gerry Mc-
Donald and Bill Walker took their
turns in splitting the cords with sets.
This display of accuracy was too
much for the Willies as they lost
their lead and the game.
