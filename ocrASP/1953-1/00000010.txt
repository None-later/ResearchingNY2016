'Ki~G~SIze

Tuesday. night was another
“Onions and Orchids" evening for
S. C. theater goers. This was evident
after the first effort which was
marked by total ineptitude of auth-
or, director and cast. The drama
was distinguished by a conglomera-
tion of particularly bad perform-
ances. Leaders in this fleldivere
Kay Wright, whose rendition of the
original “Irish washwoman” and
Diane Wheelergthe garbled author
of “Fractured‘Fi‘ench” left much to
be desired. Also to be mentioned in
this aspect were A] Weiner’s tire-
some characterization of an Eng-
lshman and Ruth Brown’s unim-
pressive, inauspicious debut.

However. in all justice I must ad-
mit I enjoyed two performances,
Eleanor Goldman's and Marilyn Er-
ter’s. Miss Goldman, brought a
freshness and vivacity to the stage.
Miss Erter's excellent talent and
ability could have been put to bet-
ter use through better direction.

Miss Cliberti's choice, a Greek
comedy, was the high point of the
evening. Seldom does a director of
the AD. class choose a play with
direct audience appeal. and on this
ground alone she merits her orchids.

 

w.

“thin I. “VIM TEIIAL'CO F»

There were a great range of per-
formances from eitcellent- to bad
with the most outstanding perform-
ance...,being contributed by Jo-Ann
Doyle'in the role of Helen.

The ‘other extreme was the unin-
spiring performance of Mr. “G”.
who lacked conviction, and was in-
consistent in his interpretation.

Jack Jacobus’ ‘.‘hamrhing" in the
role of the King marked the best
performance he has yet to contrib-
ute on this stage. Also a big fat
bouquet to Sonia Bush, seldom
seen, she gave one of the cutest
performances of the year in the role
of a slave. In parting, another fine
job was turned in by Ross Hack in
the role of Paris.

M yskania Names

The new chairman for second se-
mester will be Rose Mary Keller

Emu... Williams
To Characterize

Dickens, Heros

Renowned Dramatist
To Appear Tuesday

Emlyn Williams, famed portrayer
of Charles Dickens' characters will
bow to the State College audience in
Page Hall Tuesday afternoon at 2:30
p. m. and in the evening at 8:30 p.
m. and proceed to characterize some
75 different Dickens' heros.
Williams Simulates Dickens

In bringing to the stage the char--
acters of the Dickens novels, Wil-
liams follows in the path of the
great author who was enormously
successful at giving public perform-
ances in the English-speaking world.
Mr. Dickens himself came to Amer-
ica in 1867 to read in the old Stein-
way Hall. Standing before his desk,
his i'antail beard and ﬁnely drawn
features illuminated by gaslight,
wearing a frock coat. white gloves
and the inevitable carnation, Mr.
Dickens duplicated the voices and
pantomined the actions of Scrooge,
Tiny Tim. Mrs. Cratchit, Nicholas
Nickleby, the two Dombeys and a
host of others.

Dickens Was Actor

Dickens' fame as an author over-
shadows the fact that he acted and
directed in the London treatre. He
did splendidly as Shallow in “The
Merry Wives of Windsor." and suc-
ceeded in playing six different roles
in “Mrs. Nightingale's Diary." which
he also directed. Dickens remarked:
“I always wished to be a great act-
or, to have the public at my feet."
Williams Acts in Films

Williams admits to the same de-
sire. But if he had to choose be-
tween writing and acting. he would
choose to write. As an actor. Wil-
liams played the leading roles in
the enormously successful plays
"The Corn is Green." and "Night
Must Fall." both dramas owing their
origin to his perceptive pen. He has
starred in many productions here as
well as in England. Williams has ap-
pcurcd with the Old Vic and has
bccn soon in a score of films not-
ubly. “The Citadel." “Hatter's Cas-
tle." "The Frightened Lady.” and
“Major Barbara."

When, as an almost illiterate
youth working in the mines, Wil-
ihc urging of an interested school
limns struggled through Dickens at
tcnchcr. the characters made a last-
ing impression. They were. the first
pcoplc that he met in the world of
books. As had Dickens before him.

SA Assembly
Will Consider

Today's assembly agenda will in-
clude the consideration of an am-
endment to the Student Association
Constitution. a report from Mys-
kania on the constitutionality of
the Eastern States Association is-
sue. a short exhibition of college
wrestling. and a good of the order
meeting in the remaining time. Stu-
dent Council this week considered
the Budget of Forum and Campus
Commission. heard a report from
the committee on redecorating the
cafeteria. and discussed a proposed
constitution for Photography Club.

The proposed Campus Commis-
sion budget was presented to $0 at
$105. Madeline Payne '54, moved to
cut the budget considerably. but
later withdrew her motion because
there was not a member of Campus
Commission present. Student Coun-
cil voted to suspend consideration
of the budget until a representative
or the organization is present.

Forum's budget was presented
with a motion from SC to cut the
conference line from $i84 to $128.
The motion was defeated and the
budget will be presented to SA with
a recommendation to cut the con-
ference line.

The report from the committee on
redecoration of the cafeteria was
presented. The proposed color
scheme for the four rooms is blue,
yellow and terra cotta. New chairs.
tables and curtains have been plan-
ned for. The rooms will be decorated
with pictures done by students. It
was decided to name the cafeteria

rooms for past members of the
faculty.
William Pizer '55, submitted a

proposed constitution for Photo-
graphy Club. After much debate. it
was decided to send the constitu-
tion to the SC Committee on Con-
stitutions for possible revision and
simplification.

Joseph Lombardi ‘53. announced
that Rivalry Swim is postponed un-
til Thursday. The open meeting for
revisron of rivalry will be held on
March 5 at 7:30 p. m. in Brubncher
Hall.

All College Revue Preparations

Gel Under Way

Plans i'or the first All-College Re-
vue here at State are progressing
this week. After many, many pleas
by the Revue Committee. a script
has been submitted and the major
executives have been chosen. Louise
Peificld '53 is directing the produc-
tion of" the script written by Marvin
Chernoff '54.

Publicizcd as a musical revue in
two acts, "Litilc Known Facts" is a
script that has everything Green-
wich Village Bullet. a burlesque of
the Metropolitan Opera. melodrama
und comedy are all included. A high-
light 01' the production will un-
doubtedly be the take—off on it Me-
notti opera, music by Neil Brown ’54,
librcto by Chernoi'i‘. Roberto Stcin
'56 is doing the choreography for
the entire production.

Backstage workers, as well us try-
outs for the fifty-seven ports. are
needed before much more progress
can be made. “We need pcoplel".
urges Miss Pctiicld. State (‘ollcgc
News backs up this appeal. and
hopes that these who voted for Man-
ly’s Motion will turn out to prove
its value. We showed we wanted an
All-College Revue when the motion

Al Long Last

was passch last Spring. The turnout
to date has not been in keeping with
that decision. Try-outs are being
held every afternoon. and u sign-up
sheet for committccs is posted in
the lower Draper Pcristi’lc.

Assistant. Director for the produc—
tion is Dolores Donnclly '54. In
charge of staging the rcvuc is Will—
tcr Goodcll ‘53. Co-ordinuior is But-
ty Coykcndnil ‘53.

The idea 01' on All-College Revue
was born lust year when David Mun-
ly '52, presented it motion to SA to
banish Big~4's in i'uvor oi' the revue.
The motion was considered. recon-
sidcrcd and finally passed by a close
margin. The main argument in i'nv-
or oi the revue is that it will pro-
vide an opportunity to develop
school spirit and will givc all four
classes it chance to work together
in u concerted cil'ort to produce u
show worthy of representing the col-
lege as it whole. With coopcrution
from all four classes. the revuu
should be four times as successful us
any Big—4.
