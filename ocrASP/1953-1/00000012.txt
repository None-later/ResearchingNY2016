Student Finance Board
Starts Budget Review

The Student Board of Finance is
reviewing budgets for the 1953-’54
year, reports Neil Brown '54. Stu-
dent Council Advlsor. The Board
has already passed five budgets
which constitutes approximately
one fourth of the total number
which must be approved.

It appears, from early indications.
that many of the budgets will be
increased due to rising costs and
that the total expenditures for this
year will be somewhat higher than
those of last year. it was reported
by Brown.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 20. 1953

 

Lights Flicker
As Signals Fly

The literary lights of State
College are really blinking late-
ly. Now instead of coke ma-
chines lt’s signals that are crou-
lng the Dorm Field. From whose
rooms they're emanating we're
not saying. Do some signalling
yourself and find out.

Just what sort of messages are
ﬂickering back and forth? Who
is using what code? Tune in
your study lamp and ﬁnd out.
One thing puzzles us: why the
red light in a Sayles window?
Someone setting up a darkroom.
or does that signify the fire so-
cape?

The Brubacher blinkers really
have the advantage—not only
can they signal, they can also
see who at Sayles is signalling
whom at Pierce.

We hope you all have been
able to procure room plans of
the appropriate dormitory. If
not, the Student Personnel of-
ﬂce could undoubtedly furnish
them. See you at the window.

D & A Plans
Show For Tour

The D a; A Affiliates will soon
take to the road with their presen-
tation of a one-act comedy which
is to be presented to local high
schools. civic groups and other in-
terested groups.

The purpose of the undertaking,
announces James Hughes '53, chiar-
man of Affiliates is not only for the
enjoyment of the students them-
selves who are presenting the play
but also to offer an opportunity to
others for some enjoyment.

The play is being directed by Jack
Jacobus ‘54, and will be ready at all
times to be sent to any high school
if there is a request for it.

The idea, for creating a mobile
unit, was originated by Lee Ketch.
former president of Affiliates dur-
ing her tenure in office.

When the Statesman bowed for
the seventh time this year against
Plattsburg. it was quite evident that
to match last year’s 13-7 won-lost
record would probably be almost im-
possible as the remaining 7 games

would have to all go into the win
column.

In the beginning of the ‘52-'53
campaign great things were predict-
ed for the Peds, as they seemed to
have everything. They had consid-
erable height. good ball handlers,
sharp shooters, and good reserve.
What else could any team need to
have a successful season?

State lacked something and be-
cause of the failure of the team to
come through. criticism has been di-
rected toward the Coach. the team,
and even to individual players. May-
be they or some of them deserve
part of the blame or maybe not—
who can tell. But somewhere along
the line, we have avoided the real
culprits—ourselves.

The thing that State lacked is the
thing which we are capable of sup-
plying and that is student support
or a little school spirit . . . You may
think that this plays a minor part.
but it doesn't. Men participating in
varsity athletics spend a lot of‘ time
—a lot of valuable time working and
practicing to improve themselves
and their team and what do they
get from it. I don't think I will be
too wrong in saying almost nothing.
What difference does it make if they
win or lose? The only ones appar-
ently affected are the coaches, play-
ers. and a few other individuals with
athletic inclinations, all which adds
up to something less than a mi-
nority. Many of the students think
that just coming to a game is a
vigorous activity itself let alone
cheering besides.

School spirit can be the difference
between success and failure of any
team. And if you ask any of the
fellows they will tell you that it al—
ways seems to be present at other
schools. where enrollment is smaller.
Last Saturday in Plattsburg the
students got together a band which
played during time outs and inter-
missions. It was surprising. the bear-
ing which it had on the game. One
of the players said after the game
that the band pepped things up and
let them know seine one was behind
them. The students in that school
had some spirit even though their
team is having a mediocre season.

We don't have a band and we
don't need one, but we do have
cheerleaders. who perform not for
everyone's entertainment, but to
help the fans cheer. Five girls don't
make very much noise alone. Cheers
are simple, the essential thing is a
good voice. The Feds have ﬁve more
home games. so how about coming
to the next game and letting the
other schools know that we are alive.

Prindle have come it long way since
pl‘ili‘Lll'C started in December. The
veterans of the squad all turned in
fine jobs in subduing their oppon-
ents. Bob Drehcr run into tough
luck again this week. He lost a real
tough bout to Jack White. Bob has
yet to hit his stride. but Couch
(lill‘('lil has high hopes for this
year‘s cupiuln.

Locals meet Darrow tomorrow

The sqiiiifl is working out this
week in preparation for the coming
bottle with Darrow tomorrow. The
big nmiches of the your are yet to
come. The home and home series
wnh Middletown point up a stellar
contest between two very evenly
pitted tennis.

Club desires varsity rating

This is the second year that

wrestling has been in a club basis

Misfit Quintet
Tops Commuters

As the Intramural Bowling
Leagues near the end of the season
they seem to have developed an
acute case of “forfeit-itis." The past
couple of weeks have seen more
matches forfeited than the total of
all previous games of the season.
In last Tuesday's matches at the
Rice Bowling Alleys all of the games
with the exception of one were de-
cided via the forfeit route. This lone
contest saw League B's Misfits cop
three points from the Commuters.
Rudy Body paced the Misﬁt quintet
as he smashed the maples for a
493 triple. John Wilson and McCor-
mick rolled 490 and 469 respectively
for the winners. Herb Safran bowled
a triple of 479 for the losing cause
of the Commuters.

In League A Kappa Beta and the
Rousers forfeited to Thurlow Hall.
the current top team in A League.
and APA. ,

First Place at Stake

Next week will probably bring
about one of the most important
matches of this year’s pin competi-
tion. This game will pit the Thurlow
Hall ﬁve against the APA team.
This match will deﬁnitely decide the
ﬁrst place team in League A. Thur-
low Hall is currently leading the
APA quint 31‘2-8‘: to 33—11. If the
APA gang sweeps four points from
the Thurlow team they will move
into undisputed possession of the
top spot. On the other hand. if
Thurlow gains a split in the match.
they will retain their choice posi-
tion, leading the pack. A new addi-
tion to the Thurlow Hall roster,
Jack Hughes who is a competent
bowler in his own. may well prove
to be the deciding factor in the
outcome of this crucial game.

Causes For Forfeitures

One of the main causes for all of
the forfeits of late may be the fact
that certain teams are just about
assured of their playoff spots. This
certainly is no reason for the lower
place teams to fail to show up and
deprive the other teams of the bowl-
mg.

In order to clear up a misconcep-
tion that seems to be confusing
some students. we would like to ex-
plain the position of this column
in relation to Women’s Athletic As-
sociation. The purposes of this col-
umn is to comment and report on
any and all women's athletics that
may take place on campus, and
can include rivalry events, class
competitions or individual perform-
ances. Since, of course, WAA spon-
sors and manages by far the great-
est part of women’s events. most of
the news concerns its work.

Therefore, in the light of this
fact, information or comments that
appear here cannot be considered
as necessarily the opinion of WAA.

As the result of Tuesday’s Bas-
ketball game in which Beta Zeta
defeated Chi Sigma Theta. 34-19,
82 emerged as the undefeated vic—
tors of the League B competition.
Chi Sig is second with two losses.

In League A. another undefeated
team. Phi Delta, is on top. Kappa
Delta follows closely behind in sec-
ond place with only one loss. Con-
gratulations are in order for these
teams that have distinguished them-
selves.

More Bouquets

While on the subject of basket-
ball, how about some praise for the
referees who did a really nice job?
These girls give up two evenings a
week ot go down to the gym to
ref, and get very little recognition
for their efforts.

WAA will hold a replacement
election for Junoir representatives
to Council on Monday and Tues—
day of next week. Balloting will
be under the WAA bulletin board.
A list of Juniors who have received
credit in one sport and who are
therefore eligible to vote will be
posted. Athalia Thompson, Barb
Smith, Shirley Nellis, and Jean
Rasey are running for or have been
nominated for the position.
Bowling Records

Sally May rolled a high single of
160 in last week's bowling at Rice's.
Her double, also high for the day.

State Downed
By PSTC 74-70,-
Welker Hits 21

Playing their last road game of
the season tomorrow night, the
statesmen will be going against the
Harpus Colonials in Endicott. Har-
pur fell victim to State earlier in
the year, but like last year they can
prove dangerous at home when they
squeezed out a one point victory.
With Bob Tabor and John Allasio
off the sick list, the Feds will be
at full strength and should chalk
up a victory.

Sears hits 30 for Plattsburg

Last Saturday night in Plattsburg,
a 2 point half-time deficit didn’t
prove enough as the P.S.T.C. boys
rolled to a 74-70 victory behind Jim
Sear’s 30 points. As was expected,
Plattsburg started quick as Gary
O‘Leary hit with the first of his
many long sets for the night. Pete
Telfer evened the score for Albany
as he hit with a driving one hand-
er. The game continued in this man-
ner with first Plattsburg then Al-
bany holding a slim one or two
point lead. At the end of the first
half, the score was 39-37 in favor
of Albany. In the second half
Sears and O'Leary quickly tied the
score for Plattsburg. The Feds kept
pace as Bill Walker and Pete Tel-
fer hit consistently with short jump
shots. A 5 point lead held briefly
by State was the biggest gap be-
tween the two teams during the
third canto.

Fouling heavy for State

In the final quarter. personal
fouls began to play a vital role as
McDonald. Contra. and LaRoe all
were hampered with 4 personals.
LaRoe left the game early in the
fourth quarter when he fouled
Sears for his fifth foul. With about
three minutes remaining in the
game Plattsburg held a two paint
lead which was widened as Sears
fast broke and scored on a lay-up.
This was enough as the apparent
wifnners put on a freeze which paid
f

o .

Walker hit for 21 markers for his
night, while Telfer had his best
scoring night of the year with 18
points.
