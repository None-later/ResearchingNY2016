(EDITOR'S NOTE: Numerous re-
quests haue been received by the
Sure Causes News for the intro-
duction of an educational column.
In this issue the News prints the
ﬁrst in a series of such columns.
Anyone interested in contributing
to this 'column is requested to con-
tact the Editor-in-Ghiel.

This ﬁrst article deals with the
uses and misuses of the terminology
“educational philosophy”)

Of‘ all the phrases tossed so aptly
at thé'iembryo teacher, “educational
philosophy" is probably the most
unfortunate. That it is unfortunate
is by no means due to any lack of
sensitiveness in the phrase itself. It
has become an almost worthless
phrase simply because it has been
exploited by professional and nov-
ice alike, gradually losing signific-
ance and broadening its scope until
it suggests today only that pair of
hackneyed generalities, traditional-
ism and progressivism.

It may be argued that the term
educational philosophy has reached
its logical conclusion. It extends an
air of authority, now, over both
camps in the field of education, and
this is very probably its limit unless
a new movement in education is
launched. But is this the logical end
of educational philosophy? Can it
not be of more service to education
in general? It is not difficult to
realize that when the essentialistic
movement collapses (as it ultimate-
ly must), there will be no use for
a system of values or preferences
such as are sugested by the term.
Educational philosophy will have
served its purpose.

It will have served its purpose,
that is, unless it is turned around
and .natde to back track down its
own path, shortening its scope once
again, and gradually limiting its
meaning until it becomes concerned
primarily with the issues facing ed-
ucation in the United States today.
How much better to have teachers
concerned with exemplifying democ-
racy in the classroom, than to have
them disputing antique issues. In

unique talents amid much skepticism
on the part of many of his friends.
They said he couldn’t be a success.

The friends p r o v ed wrong, for
Williams’ fabulous impersonation

Broadway and now on a trans-con-
tinental tour of the United States,

teaching, as in any other profes-
sion worthy to be called such. a def-
inite system of values, desires, and
preferences is necessary so that
there will be some shortening of the
long, dark tunnel.

Let those, then, who have accept-
ed the new role of education adopt
for themselves a new educational
philosophy that will set up guides
for a systematized attack on the
faults and lackings of our educa-
tional system. Only in this way will
the needs of the country be met.

Teachers who lack a philosophy of
their own can never hope to be of
real service to their profession. A
teacher who majors in “classroom
teaching" instead of merely subject
matter will serve as the best means
to the end. Anyone aspiring to be a
good teacher must, of necessity,
pause somewhere in his travels in
order that he may formulate some
plan that will guide him in his
Wol‘k. For some teachers the pause
is too short; others never stop at
all.

If advancement is to be made in
education, it must be carried
through at the classroom level, not
in the brains of the great thinkers.
It is up to each individual teacher.
therefore, to decide what must be
done and how it is to be accom-
plished.

FCC Allocoies 242 Channels
Schedule Tourney For Educational TV Exploitation

Educators have waged and won a
hard fought battle with commercial
opponents concerning TV. The Fed-
eral Communications Commission
has set aside 242 channels for edu-
cational stations, of which two have
actually been constructed to date.

Commercial interests have assail-
ed educational television as social-
istic. This same argument was used
against the idea of a public school
system 100 years agol!

In some ways educators were their
own enemies. Few have been gen-
uinely enthusiastic for the vast op-
portunities that television could 0f~
for education.

How long the channels will be re-
served for educational stations is a
q u e s t i o n confronting educators.
Money seems to be the imposing
factor preventing the establishment
of stations. Meanwhile, after June
2. commercial stations may apply
for these channels.

One reason educators have not
fought strongly for educational sta-
tions is that they are in a dilemma.
This; may be illustrated by an an-
ccdotc of Milton Eisenhower as
quoted by John Crosby in his “Ra-
dio and Television Column" in the
New York Herald Tribune. Crosby
states: “Once a third grade teach—
cr asked her pupils to draw a pic-
ture of what they wanted to be when
they grew up. The pictures came in

pictures of nurses. of space cadets,
of firemen—but one little girl hand-
ed in a blank sheet of paper. ‘Don’t
you know what you want to be

er. ‘Sure, I know,’ retorted the lit-
tle girl. 'I want to be married. But
I dont’ know how to draw it.’ Those
in favor of educational TV similarly
know what they want but are at a
loss for concrete proposals because
they are setting foot in an uncharted
wilderness."

One great advantage of education-
al TV stations has been cited. Col-
leges could exchange programs of
their first-rate courses. This would
eliminate many of the programming
difficulties which educators may en-
counter.

Educators feel that this new
means of communication offers
great opportunities for advancing
education.
