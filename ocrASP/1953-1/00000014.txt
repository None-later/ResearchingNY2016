Help Week . . .

We .were happy to see that, once more this year,
Inter-Sorority Council has traded fun and foibles
for fun and constructive enterprizes with the substi-
tution of Help Week, which begins Monday, for
the former Hell Week. All next week the pledges of
seven sororities on campus will be taking part in a
program which is receiving more and more atten-
tion in colleges throughout the country—that of
channeling the imaginations and ambitions of haz-
ing experts into more positive and durable results.
It seems that, in order to become a member of a
closely knit group with recognized social standing,
the nominee must somehow prove his worth, or, in
some cases, prove that he can take it. What better
way to prove something more than the ability to
take a joke than to devote time to charity organiaz-
tions, youth centers, and the like? The fun of the
initiation period remains, but only, we hope, as an
incidental factor to a far better purpose—Help. We
hope that in years to come this will become an es-
tablished and expanded tradition at State.

 

Hats all to the State Fair Committee, all the or-
ganizations which contributed their time and efforts
to making it a proﬁtable event, and especially to
the faculty for an evening of fun and a proﬁt, im-
officially estimated, 0} close to $450.

Loolt Before . . .

Today in Assembly SA will have as guest speak-
er the President of the student body of Champlain
College. Undoubtedly, he will ask for the support
of our student body in his college’s attempts to
forestall Government action in reclaiming the land
upon which Champlain is located for the purpose
of building an Air Force Base. We do not wish to
anticipate the words of the speaker. Without doubt,
he will have an interesting and vital case to place
before us, however, a word of caution. Make sure
you know where the bandwagon's going before you
jump on.

inconclusive, But . . .

Two weeks ago in Assembly, the News Q inducted
a poll on the desires of SA in regard to evening
hours for the College Library. The original purpose
of the poll .that of getting student opinion in black
and white in the hope that it might stir action, was
not fulfilled. since response was so small due to
the meager attendance in that week's meeting (Only
381 polls were turned in.) Therefore, we do not
pretend to have established anything conclusive;
however, if we tnay draw a Conclusion frotn these
written opinions and from others presented to us
orally we feel that a definite indication has been
heard from a sufficient number of students to war-
rant attention. Thc indication is this: many feel
that a college library should better serve the stu-
dents of the college iii the matter of evening hours,
or, if that library must limit itself to two nights a
week available for student use. that it not include
the day when all sororities and fraternities hold
meetings on those nights. A few evcn felt that it
should remain open cvcry week day night.

This matter has bccn taken to the Administra~
tion several times and has ncvcr rcccivcd a negative
or even discouraging answer, therefore we feel thcrc
is hope. if it is a matter of need for additional help.
wc hope that an attempt will be made to providc
for that iii thc ncxt budget. in ihc meantime. why
not take on additional student aid? All the expan-
sion iii facilities and collct‘iioli is of iittlc liclp wlicn
they are locked up win-n you nccd lllt'lli most.

“But the set isn’t om?!”

 

:4 New ﬂppwacﬁ?

 

In the not too distant future, a
collossal event will once again come
to State College—the annual budget
hearings before Student Association.
Budgets will be passed and rejected,
raised and lowered by a weary and
dormant student Association. And in
many cases. the word “dormant.”
may be taken in the strictest sense
of the word. Cries will be heard that
certain organiaztions are extrava-
gant spendthrlfts. Threats and even
motions will be made on the As-
sembly floor to strike out budgets.
or at least parts of them. Such is
a description of the feature ﬁttl’ﬂCn
tion which is soon to come to State
College.

It seems to many of us that this
whole situation might be vastly im-
proved by some really intelligent
and rational thinking on our part.
Too many times, Student Associa-
tion is confused and bewildered.
Too many times. they accept the
thoughts and opinions of others,
without thinking for themselves.
And too many times, budgets are
passed or rejected solely on the lid»?
vice of others. Perhaps in many
cases. the root of tho problem lies
in the fact that student Association
may not have adequate criteria for
purposes of judgment. It seems to
me that there should be but two
main criteria—what the organiza—
tion docs for the individuals (‘011-
ncctcd with it and what the organ-
tuition does for the name of Shite
College.

Let us consider the first criterion.
What does the organization do for
those who belong to it and work in
it? Does it endeavor to bring out
the best that its in those students?
Does it. help to develop in those lit-
dividunls qualities which are liticcs-
>lll'y for life in a democratic socio~
ty'.’ it would seem that this should
be uppermost iii otir minds.

Secondly, what docs the organiza-

tion do for State College itself? Is
the name and prestige of our col-
lege enhanced by this organization’s
activities? This second criterion is
perhaps not as important as: the
first. but it should certainly be
taken into consideration.

This year there seems to have dos
veloped a third criterion. Questions
such as the following are being ask-
ed of organizations: How many
people benefit directly from that ac-
tivities of your organization? What
is actually the 'hard core" or your
organization? How can you justify
spending the amount of your budget
on the number of people in your
organization? These questions hard-
ly seem to be a. fall; criterion for
judgment of an orgnnlzgllgp where
the organization involved is open 9
to everyone. Surely students cannot
be forced to participate in an acti-
vity. It is certainly unfortunate that
more students here at State do not
participate in more activities. al—
though multitudus slg‘n up to; them
on Activities Day. But. it. hardly
seems justifiable to judge any one
organization solely on grounds of
popularity. It is utterly impossible
for everyone to benefit dlrectly from
tho activities of any organizatlpn.
Are we forgetting that those who
put their utmost in an activity iii-‘0

Therefore, in the weeks ahead. let
us remember that the really impor-
tant things to be taken into con-

does for those who participate in
it and what it does for Stain.- 901-

NEBULOUS SUBTLETIES

During the past two weeks we have noticed an in-
creased amount of carelessness on the part of the
student body in the cafeteria. No one seems to be re-
sponsible enough to pick up his garbage after he has
ﬁnished eating. Even when dishes, paper, etc.. are
piled high on the table, many people pile them still
higher. Also, the leaving of coke and milk bottles on
the floor in the annex is becoming a hazard to inter-
cafeteria travel. We have heard many complaints
about the unhealthy conditions which prevail in the
cafeteria, and we feel that; we have no one to blame
but ourselves. If every student would take it upon
himself to pick up his dishes and papers after ﬁnish-
ing his lunch. our cafeteria wolud be quite a on
poster, and complaints would be fewer.
UNINTELLIGIBLE MESS

There have meen many complaints concerning the
newly acquired television set. which has been placed
in the lower lounge at Brubacher. We feel that some
of these are justiﬁed. Perhaps the most constructive
complaint is that of placing the set in the lounge in
the first place. Since the Television set has been there.
the lounge has lost its advantages for quiet study and
is in a constant state of disorder. The furniture has
been forced to one end of the room, the lights are
usually out and the noise of the set is. at times, un-
bearable. Before the permanent aerial has been in-
stalled we would suggest that SUB look into the pos-
sibility of putting the set into one of the activity
rooms. This would probably have many advantages
over the present system.

The only difﬁculty that comes to mind is that of
furniture for the room-1f SUB could furnish such a
room and find some furniture for it. we might have
a place for study and a place for TV viewing. at, the
same time.

WORN OUT CLICHES

We note with interest the sudden upswing of activ-
ities of certain fraternities. as the day of reckoning
gyrtwg ppar. Last; minute jitters have made the fra-
cennltlps put pgt a call for: a ﬁnal and glorious blast
of feverish activity, in the hope that all will not be
lost. We hope that the freshmen men will not. let
their vision be clouded by such furtivc actions.
PUERILE COMPLAINTS

We were sorry to hear that many people did not
enjoy the performance of Emlyn Williams last. Tues-
day. We found it very difficult to understand why
some individuals could come away from the auditor-tum
wholly unimpressed, and even be critical of D and A
for bringing Mr. Williams to State. We believe 1) and
A should be highly commended for putting on such
an event; and we hope they will continue the policy
in the future.

VENOMOUS lllATRIBEH

Undoubtedly we will again be confronted with the
problem of compulsory insurance in the very near
future. The two choices will probably be compulsory
insurance or a new. higher insurance rate for those
who want a policy. We are inclined to favor the
former, yet we would ﬁrst investigate other insurance
companies to see what they have to offer. We have
become so involved with our present company that
wt: might. have overlooked advantages which could bc
offered by others for the same price. We do not mean
to say that the present company is not chCl‘ving of
commendation. but there are undoubtedly others who
might give them a little competition it we were to
notify these companies of our desires. This competi-
tion would probably bring about some compromise
which would be advantageous to us.

State Succumbs
To Fair Gaiety

"Now where shall we go?” was
the word at State Fair as people
milled around the concessions
full of fantasy, humor, and food.

Hot dogs and coke were trans-
formed into camel’s rolls and
oasis guzzle in the unbelievable
world of Psi Gamma’s Arabian
cafe. Food and paintings were
sold by the faculty. The delect-
able pop corn, punch, and other
cdibles brought satisfied expres-
sions to the faces in the crowds.

Students could try their care-
ful aim at targets. such as the
members of Myskania; and
were transported to the world of
freaks and the era of the Nic-
klcotlcon. Several brave couples
took the leap and got married
at the Fair.

Prizes. applause. and piano
selections brought a fitting close
to the gaiety of State Fair for
another year.

stood on a. small red rug that was
not visible to the entire audience.
The rest of the stage was bare. The

beard and a multitude of hair. He
carried a number of volumes, faded
in color and considerable in size.
He walked to his “desk.” put the
books down gently and proceeded
to take off his gloves. He did so with
an inﬁnite amount of care and not
without obvious relish. When the
gloves were off he thrust them on
the desk. About him was an air of
accomplishment. and triumph. He
looked at his audience. He seemed
surprised to ﬁnd people in the bal-
cony. He picked up one of the vol-
umes, beheld its title from a dist-
ance, drew it closer and began to
read.

There followed one of the most
satisfying and memorable experi-
ences ever to be found within a
theatre. His voice. an instrument of
extraordinary range and magniﬁcent
quality. brought music to the audi—
ence. It sang and laughed and paint-
ed vivid pictures of great beauty.
His mobile face contorted into an
endless parade of striking poses, an
inexhaustible variety of expressions
that ran from the sublime to the
ridiculous. And through it all beam-
ed the radiance of his own person-
ality. a forceful but charming one.
vital and warm. He seemed to love
what he was doing and eager to
share his enthusiasm for his ma-
terial with the audience. He seemed,
indeed. to be very fond of his audi—
ence.

Needless to say. it was a mutual
love.
