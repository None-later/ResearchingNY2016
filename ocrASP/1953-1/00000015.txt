To the Editor:

For the past six months the
dwindling number of readers of the
“Common-stator” have been sub-
jected .to an incessant outpouring
of disgusting triyia and puerile com-
plaints.

Combining the venomous dia-
tribes of a cobra and worn-out
cliches, this column has deteriorated
to an unintelligible mess unworthy
of as fine a paper as the NEWS.
The feeble attempts at eruditlon
have resulted only in. adding this
column to the cult of unintelligibl-
lity. The vague innuendoes and ne-
bulous subleties have been so ob-
scure that they have escaped the
comprehension of all but a select
many.

Where are the days of the con-
structive criticism and wit of
Schultz and Eade. Gorskie and
Kyle, Dunn and Peene? Now is the
time to exchange mediocrity and
bland utterances for positive opin-
ions concerning State's problems
and views better-representing the
student body.

Yours truly,
David E. Gardinier '53

To the Editor:

Something must be done! Are we
adult college students? Naturally we
claim to be! Then why do we insist
on acting like a group of grade
school children who have not yet
learned to pick up after ourselves?
There are ashtrays in the Commons.
They were placed there, not as an
item of decoration, but for YOUR
CIGARETTE BUTTS. Only an ex-
tremely lazy person cannot reach an
ashtray and should be forced to use
the floor. Did someone say there
aren’t enough ashtrays? Then per-
haps those persons who pocketed
the table ashtrays that were placed
there will be kind enough to return
them to the Commons. Tell me,
doesn’t your conscience bother you?
Another item which is perhaps even
more important than these cigar-
ette butts which are so sloppily
stamped on the floor, is the matter
of those Coke bottles which are
rolling all over the floor and cover-
ing every available writing space on
tables and seats. If you find that
you're too weak, after finishing
your coke. to carry the bottle out
with you and to place it in one of
the empty cases put there for your
convenience. then perhaps you’d
better see your doctor or start tak-
ing your vitamin pills.

Campus Commission members
have tried to keep some semblance
of order in the Commons. but we
shouldn't be expected to turn into
a janitorial or cleaning committee.
What do you say? Are you going to
do your share to make the Com-
mons one that you can be proud
of. or are you contented to sit in
it in the messy condition which you
continually keep it in!

We don't want to sound too
harsh. but how about being a little
more careful, huh?

Any suggestions which any stu-
dent might have about keeping the
Commons clean will be greatly ap-
preciated. Address notes to either
Owen Smith. Fran Bethea. or Joan
Mitchell.

Sincerely,
Fran Bethea
Joanie Mitchell

To the Editor:

The public relations department
at State is in dire need of repair“
or construction.

Many of us students have often
wondered why State is not equally
represented amongst the local col-

STATI COLLEGI NEWS; FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 27. 1983

.—

 

leges in the local daily newspapers
Between semesters this wonderment
was put in the form of a letter to
the editor of one of the local news-
papers, namely “The Times-Union.”
In this letter I criticized (without
justification it appears) the paper
ior neglecting to give State equal
representation in its social and ath-
letic events.

Here is the gist of the reply writ-
ten to me by Mr. Albert J. Bearup,
Acting Managing Editor:

“ ‘The Times-Union’ strives to give
proper representation to all the
school is in the vicinity. However,
our staff is not large enough to pro-
vide representation at the dozens
of sports events which occur, usually
on weekends. So. to give coverage,
we must depend on the schools to
work with us in providing informa-
tion.

“As you probably know, each col-
lege in our area has a press rela-
tions department which aids not
only the college, but also the serving
newspapers.

“Might I suggest that State also
build up an adequate bureau which
would feed its material to the news-
papers? Certainly we of ‘The Times-
Union' do not wish to neglect your
school and if you establish a press
department similar to those of Si-
ena and ABC, which you mention-
ed in your leter, you will find that
State will get more news space, not
only in our paper, but in others in
this section.

“Such a bureau would also aug-
ment publicity relative to other
events at the school, such as plays
and social events.”

There is deﬁnitely a need for bet-
ter public relations for State here
in Albany. I know little of the func-
tions of our own Press Bureau, but
I would assume that it does not
rand should not: handle local pub-
lic relations.

From Mr. Bearup’s letter, it would
seem very advantageous to the col—
lege to “get on the ball." It would
appear that what we need is a Pub-
lic Relations Department to work
with the local newspapers. College—
community relations are bad. They
can be improved. The 10cal papers
are ready to work with us (so this
letter indicatedl. What is stopping
the College from working with the
community?

One beer. 0

Was it worth it this morning?
One beer, 0

From “Observer”: Rutgers, a

freshman speaks thus after remem—
bering the glowing terms in which
they were described at orientation
luncheon:
We're the cream of the crop.
We‘re the best of the bunch,
So why do they feed us
Raw chopped meat for lunch?
Ah, truth is divine
Let me make it my own
But my mind functions better
With filet mignon.

By ABEL BLATTMAN

 

 

It was like some wonderfully in-
tricate musical pattern for ten short
minutes on Monday. Weave, drive,
feed, shoot. We could feel the rhy-
thm, and note the variations. We
could sense the pleasure that the
performers must have felt in their
brief capture of perfection. They
were doing a job and doing it well.
Weave, drive, feed, shoot. Again and
again. They liked it. The fans liked
it too. Then it was gone. It came
back in a few spots. but for the
rest of the game the gufs were just
good. During those ten minutes thef
mere great.

To whom do the laurels go? First
to Nels LaRoc, whose sterling de-
fense, and whose last second hoop
forced the game into an extra ﬁve
minutes. First also to John Centra,
whose 22 markers paced the Peds
attack. First also to Hiram Walker,
who has regained the old touch, the
drive and spark that we all knew
he had. '

We’ve been criticized in the past
for knocking the ball club. People
have claimed that tearing them
apart was easy; that building them
up was hard. All we have to say in
defense of our opinion is that the
exact opposite is true. It certainly
isn’t easy to needle guys we've play-
ed ball with, guys whose hard work
we respect and admire. but for a
time something was missing. It's not
.nissing now.

Tomorrow the squad takes on a
scrappy New Paltz team. The New
Paltz coach is a cagey one, every-
thing from waxed basketballs to a
tricky zone defense. The tilt prom-
ises to be a thriller as is generally
the case when the statesmen take
on the Orange and Blue.

On Saturday. the College will act
as host to the Capitol District High
Schools in a local area debate and
the participants have been extended
an invitation to attend the game.
Off the Boards:

statesmen sporting 9—3 overall
record, 6-3 on the friendly confines
of Page . . . Nels LaRoc has hit for
122 at home in 9 tilts compared to
48 in 8 on the road . . . State aver—

Wednesday night the freshman
IM basketball teams, the White
Eagles of the B League and Sum-
mit House of the C League. had a
very successful evening as they both
won tough games. In the other game,
APA rolled over the Rebels in the
B League. Summit House looks un-
Leatable in their league and Sehon-
berg is still scoring. In Wednesday’s
game he hooped 35 as Summit
Crushed KB, 64-36. The White Eag-

League B as they nipped the stub-
born Finks. 34-29. Hughes had 10
and Sheedy 8 for the Eagles. The

“Flash” Fox and Hank Hull hooped
17 and 12 points respectively.

Three of the best games of the

year were played in Monday night's

points were high for the wellwbnl-
anced Club team, while Bob Strau-
ber's 21 for the Indians was high for
the evening. In League B. the up-
and-coming Rebels nipped VanDer-

Johnson and Marsh netted 12 and
10 respectively for the Rebels as
Coan hooped 15 for the losers. The

Tomorrow morning in Page Hall
the top basketball teams in their
respective leagues will play off to
determine the winner of the cup.
Phi Delta will meet Beta Zeta in
what promises to be a very spirited
clash between two very good teams.
WAA extends an invitation to spec-

morrow to watch this game? The at-

poor this year to say the least. Per-

chance to catch a game when there's
no homework to do, (let it go until
later! nothing to do, nothing to wor-

In the Thursday afternoon bowling
leagues, Kappa Delta still stands
at the top with 15 wins and three
losses. One new record was Set in
last week's games, according to the

Tomorrow night at 7:30, p.m. the
statesmen will tangle with New
Paltz on the Page hardwoods. New
Paltz was an easy victim for State
earlier in the year. but with a scor-
er like Andy Juhl and an all-around
scrapper like Donoghue, they could
prove troublesome to the Feds.

After chalking up a 12 point mar-
gin early in the first quarter, the
Feds iounds themselves trailing‘ Wil-

tempt to get their offense clicking.

eral times, and the quarter ended
