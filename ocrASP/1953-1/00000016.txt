Kapner Presents Legion Requests Freshmen Gain

Insurance Plan
For Consideration

(Continued from Page I, UUlu‘ﬂl" 4;

case, Council recommended that the
Commons line, ':.:.w reading $15 be
reduced to $10, and the purchase
of playing cards for the Commons
be eliminated.

Art Kapner, local insurance rep-
resentative, was present at the
meeting for the discussion of the
program of compulsory insurance
which his company has offered for
consideration. The plan would be an
allocated program with the pre-
mium set at $16.50. Aside from its
compulsory nature, the major dif-
ferences from the plan which SA
subscribes to at present would be a
reduction of coverage to a Septem-
ber to June period and a five dollar
deductable clause on prescriptions,
meaning that medication would be
covered by the policy only when in
excess of five dollars, for each inci-
dence. Council asked Kapner to in-
vestigate possibilities of plans with-
out these limitations.

Ten Counsellors

A request for ten counsellors to
attend the 1953 Empire Girls' State,
sponsored by the American Legion
Auxiliary has been received in the
ofnce of the Dean of Women. The
gathering will be held at Skidmore
College from June 23 to July 2.

Counsellors are needed to work
with groups of nigh school girls who
are delegates, to assist the house-
mothers in the daily routine in each
house, and to help in carrying out
the Girls’ state program. All ex-
penses for the counsellors will be
paid, and. in addition. there will be
a small cash payment.

Reports from those who have
taken these positions in previous
years indicate that they found the
experience valuable. Any women
students interested in availing
themselves of the opportunity to
participate as counsellors in the 1953
Girls' State program are asked to
contact Dr. Ellen G. Stokes, Dean
of Women, in her office as soon as
possible.

Pledges Sport

Aches, Pains

At lost it's over! The bruised
and battered sorority pledges
who have survived the trials
and smiles of Help Week can be
recognized by that hopeful ex-
pression on their bandaged faces
as they look forward (through
blackened eyes) to Sunday night
and formal initiation.

Some of the ingenious antics
contrived by the twisted brains
of various HEmeasters have
caused shrieks, subs and groans
from our courageous pledges.
Backachcs from shining shoes
in the, Commons. guilt feelings
from borrowing bow tics from
the faculty. and strained mus-
cles from measuring statues in
Washington Park are maladies
common among these unfortu-
nate neophytcs.

But there is a look of fiend-
ish expectation in the eyes of
those who survived the week.
The thought behind the look
is one of vengeance: Pity the

Daniel Boeke, Dutch Freshman

Describes School In Holland

Among the new freshmen here at
State tins some tcr is Daniel Bock-e,
from Biltthcn, Holland. Mr. Books
1) the Un tcd States in 1947
as a gi'adizaLe 01 an agricultural
SL‘llOOl in lioiand. Due to a pro-
Ionlcd :l.ncss, he was obligated to
one up its ambitions in agriculture
and nun to teaching. Mr. Boeke in-
it his to work for a Bachelor of Arts
degree here at Siate as the first
step in his academic training.

L'illil'.‘

It was Mr. Beeke's fortunate ex-
perience to have attended the Chil-
(ircn's Community Workshop School
in Billhovcn. This school. founded
in 1926. is umquc in its purposes
and organization. The school cov—
ers both clcmentary and high school
levels, and its students range in age
irom three to eighteen. It started
as the idea 01' one man to educate
his own children, and has grown to
include approximately 381) pupils.
The unique purpose of this School is
to prepare the student for lil'e by
teat-him him to think for h mseli,
to question what is put before hiin,
ll acquire a natural respect for
those lll positions of authority. and
to develop lll:~. personality at his own
kpcezl on his own lll tialive. Toler-
ance, underslainlln; and immunity
are the natural outgrowths of this
purpose.

Some of the ways this ideology is
put into practice \vill surprise many
of our [li'tllil'l‘ﬁnul' educators. Slu-
iii'llt‘i and teachers address each
other by their first names, much
emphasis in the curriculum is plac-

ed upon music, literature, arts and
crafts. Final examinations have
been replaced by a system of smaller
to is that subdivide the content of
the courses. Varying age groups are
found in each CAilSS, as students are
encouraged to progress at their own
speed. Weekly meetings of the stu-
units and director‘s ol‘ the school are
held to rcvicv. rcguladons necessary
for the efficient operation of the
school. At these meetings. all com-
p.aints are heard and debated. The
.idtftlli is on finding a solution, with
all Sides of a question compromising
to reach this solution.

The school is not apart. from the
real problems of society. however.
Snce most of the pupils live at
home they cope with practical prob-
;em. as well as ideal situations. One
titlLd'mlil ol' the workshop is that it
com not prepare adequately for ex-
isting society. This is very true, ill
that the students are encouraged to
question conditions they are faced
with. All students are given a
chance to develop their individual
capaeit cs. No Virtue is placed upon
competition; no grades are given;
the student either passes or fails.

An example of the practical ways
in which the students learn is the
camp program run by the workshop.
A group of students Will take a two—
wcck i'.c.ld trip, so to speak. and
make a study of geography. social
system. and industry of a particular
part oi' the country. This trip will
be a combined vacation and work-
shop for the students.

Tuesday evening, the Advanced

gram of three plays. They are a
