STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. MARCH 6. 1953

 

3W em

By DAVID BETCIILESS

 

Editor’s note: The author of this
column was graduated from this
college in June, 1952, and is, at
present, a student at Albany Law
School. Since _he is employed by the
State Leg-isiilature, he is familar
with the material below.

You might have noticed consis-
tant cutting by some members of
your classes these last few weeks,
or possibly a predominance of cig-
ars, and the very observant might
have seen an increase in the buying
power of a few of their fellow stu-
dents. It is nothing new for every
year at this time the Scions of the
Empire State fill their brief cases
with every form of possible legasla-
tion to assure their return to the
legislature the next time their names
appear upon the ballot.

This year's session has been over
shadowed by the innaug.. Korean
truce talks, and the fate of an
'Oleo-heir", but still the gavel is
heard banging out the rules and
regulations that will govern our
very existence for another fifty-
two weeks. This year is a run of the
mill legislative session with nothing
outstanding being offered. The “old
faithful" permanent personal reg-
istration bill has been introduced;
New York City still wants more
money (Mayor Impelliteri has been
commuting daily to Albany); there
is the rather trying problem of
whether rent controls should be con-
tinued (one report in favor of dis-
continuing controls cited the fact
that ads for apartments to rent ex-
ceed those for apartments wanted.
of course it might be that those
looking for apartments can't afford
to advertisei; another seeks to make
smoking in bed a misdemeanor:
and, as usual. school teachers want
more money. This and approximate-
ly 4,000 other bills have been drop-
ped in the box and await the scru-
tiny of one of the committees.

The end of the session is drawing
near. and the capitol lights will
burn way into the night. If you
haven't found time to take a walk
down State St. as yet. you've got
about two weeks left. Stop in any
day except Monday after 11 a. m.
or come Monday night at 8:30. You
may see some of your friends there,
it's free. and it’s the best show in
town . . .

To the Editor:

Will it be agreed that it is an
unethical policy for a newspaper to
allow a letter "To the Editor". cri-
ticizing a columnist in the paper. to
fall into the hands of that colum-
nist before the formal publication of
the letter?

It was only too obvious to last
week's readers of the NEWS that
the authors of the “Common-Stater"
had a pre-publication reading of
David Gardinier's letter "To the
Editor.”

Sincerely,
Sylvia Semmler ’54

To the Editor:

We feel that the motion made in
Assembly and the challenge to My-
skania concerning their interpreta-
tion of the Constitution. (Article V,
Par. A) are wholly unfounded in
fact:

1. By doing away with the as-
sembly as such. that is, making leg-
islation passable only by every
single member of Student Associa-
tion voting on such legislation, our
government would come to a stand—
still. No further legislation could be
passed since it is physically (insuf-
ficient accommodations in Page
Halli and Constitutionally impossi—
ble (By-Laws. Section 1. paragraphs
G and H, Sentences I. 2, 3. . . . igi
“any person who is qualified to
vote. but has for a legitimate excusc
been absent from a Student Associ-
tion meeting . . . ":hi "Legiti-
mate excuses: ll Practice teaching
2) Work in cafeteria. library.

etc. . . . 3) Any absence excused by
an authorized college agent . . ." for
every member of Student Associa-
tion to be present at one single time.

1. Constitutionaliy (By-Laws, Sec-
tion 4. Paragraph f— “decisions of
Myskania . . . shall be reconsidered
by Student Association which may
vote them by a 2-3 vote.”) This pet-
ition needs to be voted on by 2-3
of the total undergraduate member-
ship of Student Association. It is
foolish to assume that such a vote
could ever be registered in favor of
such a motion.

3. There is room for all those who
have been excused from a Student
Association meeting to come to any
such meeting and voice their opin-
ions. (e.g. football debates last year).

4. Therefore, the word assembly
cannot be synonymous with the
words Student Association. Such an
identity is constitutionally impossi-
ble. since the constitution sanctions
legitimate excuses (By-Laws, Sec-
tion I, paragraphs G and Hi—See
point No. 1). By sanctioning legiti-
mate excuses those who are not as-
signed seats are legitimately excused
by a college authority. Therefore.
the assembly constitutes all those
members of SA who are present at
an official meeting (Article IV, Sec—
tion A. Paragraph ii. and Myskania
interpretes that the assembly con—
stitutes all those who are present
at a regular meeting is Constitu-
tional and sholud stand as such.

Yours truly,

Roderick llilsinger ’53

The most impressive single aspect
of the Varsity cagers outing against
New Paltz was the performance of a
couple of guys who don’t usually
see much act on. namely Bud Prou
and Don Krug. Prout. playing on
the outside. exhibited a proficiency
in ball handling equal to that of
any of the regulars. His drive, set
shooting. and all-around field gen-
eralship left nothing to be desired
as he turned in a noteworthy job.
Krug, who plays underneath the
hoop. was master of the backboards.
and has cone a long way since the
onset of ti._ current campaign. Both
men are uIIllIOI'S and will probably
be with Lil: .qua;l for another year.

The team as a whole was more
than a match for the hustling Or-
ange and Blue quintet. The freeze
tactics of the Pods early in the
game were a delight to the State
fans, but it appeared that the locals
could have overpowered the zone
defense at will if they so wished.
The deliberate tactics oi" the Purple
and Gold aid serve to upset. tem-
porarly at least. the mental bal-
ance of the large contingency fi'om
Oran we County causing a mild tur-
mol in the s:ands. For the first
time this year, we noth a distinct
smile on Coach Hathaway‘s coun-
tenance. greatly similar to that of a
cat upon swallowing a canary.

State Conquers
New Paltz; Win
Third Straight

The Purple and Gold. with their
latest w nning streak of three
games. will be called on twice this
weekend to keep it going. Oneonta
and Utica. each boasting victories
over the Feds this year, will furnish
the opposition.

Oneonta State will lineup with
the Feds in Page tonight with the
hopes of repeating their 74-61 win
of a few Weeks ago over State.

Coach Hathaway's men won’t be
as easy a touch this time for the
Red and White. but Oneonta won't
be any pushover either as long as
Keith McCarthy and Fran Green
are in ihe lineup. They each scored
19 points in the frst game.

Utica has only managed to win 4
games in 16 contests this year, but
one of them was an overtime win
over the statesmen. The Utica
team is built around Rudy Valenzl
who po~.sesses a good hook shot. but
Jim Green is highly effective under
the boards when it comes to grab-
bing rebounds.

McDonald Lost To Squad

The statesmen will be without
the services of Gerry McDonald for
the weekend, as he suffered a
sprained ankle in practice on Tues-
as y night. McDonald has been start-
ing during the last half of the sea-
son and has come through with
some good games. Mac had his big-
gi‘sl. nights in Oneonta and Utica
when he opened up w th 16 and 22
points on successive nights.

Last Saturday night. the Peus
came through with a convincing
150-66 victory over New Paltz. State
grabbed the ball at the opening
jump and came downcourt to find
Now Pa.le throwing a zone against
them. Usually having trouble with
this kind of defense, State shouted
little respect for it this time as John
Ccntra took a pass and pushed it
Lip mic-handed for two points. After
grabbing an 11-6 edge. State chgng:
cd its tactics in attempting to force
Ncw Paltz out of" their zone. State
put on a stall for the final three
minutes of the first quarter and the
only thing merited was a 2 point
gain for New Palta,

Walker Paces Scorers With 23

Throughout the rest of the game
Sulc gradually built up a lead to a
34-24 advantage at halftime and a
50-38 edge at the three quarter
mark. Hiram Walker continued at a
hot pace as he racked up 23 points
for Slate. Contra added 15 more.
Dick King contributed 23 in a ios~
in: cause for New Paltz.
