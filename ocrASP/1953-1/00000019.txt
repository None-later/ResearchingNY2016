SA To Discuss
Two Student
Insurance Plans

Two plans for compulsory insur-
ance will be brought before the stu-
dent body for consideration today
in assembly. Both allow for cover-
age during the school months, with
benefits under both being equal with
the exception of provision for med-
ical and prescription expenses
which are limited by a $5 deduct-
able clause in one plan, thus ac-
counting for the difference in pre-
miums. Optional summer coverage
may be purchased with either plan
for an additional fee.
$16.50 Plan Limits Medicinal Bills

The first plan. with a premium of
$16.50, would cover the student from
September to June with the follow-
in; benefits. Medicinal bills (pre-
scriptions. etc.) will be paid for
when they total above $5 for any
one incident. $10 per day will be
provided for hospital care. with $40
allowed for incidental hospital ex—
penses, such as aliastliesia. The plan
would also pay $3 per doctor's visit,
starting with the first visit. and
would cover surgery up to $150. For
$5.50 the student who wishes sum-
mer coverage in addition to the pol-
icy for school months may secure
the same benefits from June to
September. However, this plan is on
an optional basis and need not be
purchased with the n'nc—month
$16.50 policy.

The other policy to be introduced
today premiums at $18.75 and of-
fers the some benefits as the $16.50
plan. The additional premium cost
is explained by the fact that the
latter policy does not have the $5
dcductable clause on medicines.
Therefore, this plan would pay any
drug bill, however small. The bll
need not come to $5 or more as in
the $16.50 plan. As with the $16.50
policy. summer coverage may be ob-
tained under this plan, for $6.25
with this policy, and is likewise on
an optional basis.

The $16.50 policy was presented to
Student Council several weeks ago.
wh lo the $18.50 plan is a result of
Council's rsquest that a policy with
more complete medicinal coverage
be investigated. Arthur Kapncr, lo-
cal representative of Mutual of Om-
.iha. underwriters of both policies,
wiil be on hand in assembly today
to explain the policies further and
answer quest ons arising over them.

Measles, Flu
Run Rampant

Have you been seeing spots
before your eyes? If so, beware
of the scourge that. is sweeping
State's dorms. Measles are hav-
ing their annual Spring fling,
along with influenza, neuralgia,
and a, few cases of mumps here
and there.

The unhappy victims of these
current epidemics will soon find
themselves rejected by suciety.
Solitary confinement, in a dark-
ened room, quantities of peni-
cillin, and a few days of com—
plete rest is reported as a cure
for all these ailments.

However, we cannot guaran-
tee the results of this treat-
ment. Some sufferers harr- sur-
vived it with nothing worsc
than mild claustrophohia. 0th-
crs of the less fortunate victims
now have developed into schiz-
ophrenics, complete. inlroverts
or hopclcss neurotics.

Will someone please pass the
antiseptic?
