Compulsory or Not . .‘

Today in Assembly, SA will be presented with
two plans for compulsory insurance, plans which
are essentially similar. For several weeks a commit-
tee operating out of Student Council has been in-
vestigating just such types of insurance, and, ap-
parently, Council as a whole has come to the
conclusion that at this time some type of compulsory
insurance would be most practical and most bene-
ﬁcial to the College as a whole. Perhaps a little
background on the situation and the reaching of
that conclusion is needed.

It will be noted that, unlike last year’s special
assemblies in which compulsory insurance was vot-
ed down, no alternative plan of insurance of an
optional nature is to be offered. This does not mean
that the company which now underwrites our pol-
icy, Mutual of Omaha, has said that it deﬁnitely
will no longer insure us on a non-compulsory basis.
Mutual has carried our present policy for six years
and in each of these years has either lost money
or just broken even. Why? Because our loss ratio
has continually been 95 to 100%. meaning that
over 95% of those participating in the plan took
more out in claims than the $25 they paid as
premium. This is obviously not good business. In
order for us to be a good risk, our loss rating ought
to be under 60%. This can never be as long as so
few (530 this year and 600-640 in the three years
before) participate. To be a safe risk, to guarantee
to the company that those participating do not
represent the most chronic claim—filers alone. SOO-
000 should be participating. This has proven to be
an impossibility tinder optional insurance.

Again. Mutual has not said that it would not
insure us on a non-compulsory basis. If SA turns
down both compulsory proposals today. the result
will be one of watching and waiting on the part of
the company to see what the prospects for partici-
pation next year are. The company has merely ex-
pressed the opinion that it would rather insure us
on a compulsory basis. If. after two or three years
under such a program. the plan proved to be a
more successful venture, it is probable that either
the premium would be reduced or the benefits ex-
tended.

Couldn't we look elsewhere for a non-compulsory
policy? Certainly, btit it stands to reason that any
new company insuring us will want to know why
we desire a change and what the experience of our
past insurers has been. Frankly, our record does
not recommend us very highly as a new account.

The policies offered you today are admittedly
more limited than the present insurance plan. They
represent. however. an attempt to conform to SA‘s
tradional demand for frugality as far as premiums
go.

Mutual of Omaha underwrites the insurance plans
of eleven units of the State University. At present.
eight of these units subscribe to compulsory insur—
ance, is this an argument for our adopting such a
policy? in itself. no. However. this does represent
a trend in policy coming from sources far above
this individual Collegew-n trend in the State Uni-
versity toward compulsory insurance in all of its
units. in other words. if we turn down such insur-
ance. there is a good possibility that eventually it
will be imposed upon us forcibly.

in this college individually. one very forceful
reason for the desirability of a compulsory plan is
the proposed instigation of football as an inter-
collegiate sport. With coverage on a voluntary basis.
we could never afford to pay the premiums on in—
surance for a football team. However. if we were
able to approach a company for such insurance and
sav that another company was already covering the
first 5500 of claims on a compulsory basis, the prem-
iums would be within our reach.

Today. .111 the arguments of individual justice
and democratic rights will no doubt be raised as
they have been whenever compulsion in insurance
has come up, 'l'hcse are not unreasonable arguments.
lust remember that lllt‘ relative merits of both types
bi insurance have been investigated and that no one
but SA stands to benefit from the introduction of a
compulsory plan. There are many points in favor
of such d plan. points which have not been arbitrar-
ilv l‘;li.~t‘ti, llon‘t reject them arbitrarily. Should
you. SA. decide to impose such insurance upon your-
Lilo-s. \\‘c predict that with the issuance of the
l‘d’t‘rilillttll Handbook next _\'t'.tl. the fee will cause
no toinnu-ut. btit will be paid by inatrit'ulating slu‘
dents .h just another standard requirement for at-
tending State. Finally. in answer to tilt' onc argu-
ment against compulsory insurance which we cori-
sidcr uiifouiit'led. we maintain that there is no stu-
dciit of this college who would not be able to re-
turn lietause of any such insurance fee imposed

upon him.

It is a basic and inevitable tenet
of life that human nature suffer
from its fatal attachment to ele-
ments which thoroughly and meth-
odically eat away at its very roots.
This "fatal attachment" is a great
pitfall of man; and to him all guilt
for it is ascribed. But it would be
better“ for tis to give man the bene-
ﬁt of the doubt, refute those who are
buying the end of man. and devote
some of otir selves and our lives to
ﬁnding and remedying that evil
force which pervades all existence
and makes of man a diminutive. a
negation of all he really is.

We had been on a weekend "lark."
and were hitch-hiking back to Al-
bany from New York City. It was
cold that Sunday afternoon. and we
remember that our store of choice
invectives had long since been ex-
hatisted on the many passing cars.
Finally. one stopped and we were
offered a ride. The driver. it turned
otit, was a Hollywood screen writer.
His car carried California plates. as
testimony. and we learned he was
just that day beginning his return
trip back to "East of Eden." after
coming to New York in the hopes of
having a play of his produced on
Broadway.

Inevitably. we got to talking about
Hollywood and writing. We were so
deeply engrossed in conversation we
nearly forgot that Albany was where
we leit him. while he continued on
through to Buffalo and points West.
But being in the middle of an inter—
esting discussion. tand he being in
no particular htirry to get to "Para-
tTise"—~tior we eitherl. we adjourned
to a bar, where we passed the re-
mainder of that afternoon.

He was yotmg. this writer. yet

age and experience had etched them-
selves deeply into what was other-
wise e. ﬁne. handsome countenance.
The bitterness of his talk almost
obliterated the already faint shad-
ow-memory that sometimes peered
out from his eyes—eyes that had
once glimpsed eternity. but were now
cold.

He spoke of many things. this dead
idealist: his youth—college and in-
tellectual growth: giant-professors
who scolded and molded him; the
electricity of delight that bolted
through him when his ﬁrst story
was bought and published by Es-
quire; the telegram from MGM of-
fering him a writing contract.

Hollywood: the technicolor grave-
yard of living men turned dust. His
writing there: two in the morning,
pounding out a story-line for the
scenarists to translate—an original
which would be credited to the name
writer drawing ﬁve thousand a week
but who got too stewed that week
to make his deadline; other morn-
ings. tired and nervous, mechanic-
ally puking out hackwork that the
gullible public would gobble up: his
producer “Ed. whip me u.) a tear—
jerker . . . You know, boy meets
girl . . . She dies . . . and all that
tripe . . . Remember. action and
crying broads—lots of it . . . "

The bottle: agonizing days and
nights of drunken disillusionment;
"how far away I am from myself—
How eaten-up and picked apart-—
h0\\'——"; the try to get back to be-
ing a human instead of a ﬁve—hund-
red-a-week machine; the play—New
York and promises; now back, btit
to where«»—to what?

The afternoon was gone; we shook
hands and went our ways.

Dear Sir:

I read in the College paper that
our fair campus is to be graced with
a new million dollar building devot—
ed to the aspirants of Dramatics
and Arts. I am very glad to hear
this as I advocate all advancements
.ind improvements that come to
State College. Yet. I feel that the
death knoll is being rung over the
.\ears of promises and pl‘OCl‘lhllllll-
lions heralding any possible ad-
vancen.ent or construction of a
iiitich needed Field House!

What has happened to the Adrift-
nistration's promise for recognition
of our need for better athletic fa-
cilities? Going back to the great
surge on catnpu~ for a football
team. I recollect that it was the de-
mand of the Administration that
we forego any such actiivties be-
cause they would hamper the State
Budget line containing an A-l
LY NEEDED FIELD HOUSE! How
Priority for our NEW AND GREAT-
then do we justify the precedence

given to the new D & A building?
I am, and always will be, an ar-
dent supporter of bigger and better
atliletits at State College. btit it
shakes my confidence to see such
outright abuse to the Athletic De-
partment Does the hand that tised
to put us on the back now hold it
knife?
Your for better days ahead.

DISGUS’I‘ING

For the past month we have noticed that certain
vulgar individuals have been adding comments to
many of the notices which are posted on various bul-
letin boards. We have also noticed that certain other
obscene announcements have been posted on many of
the bulletin boards. All of this vulgarity seems to be
the work of one specific group of individuals who for
some reason or other, like this particular brand of
humor. We do not. We will not go into a lengthy mor-
alistic discussion. since we feel that most college stu-
dents understand why humor of this sort has no place
on public bulletin boards. Any student seeing any of
this trash—either the comments or the individuals
themselves—should see to it that the papers are torn
down or the individuals reported to Campus Commis-
sion. We have already taken many of these comments
down. but this degenerate group still persists in spread-
ing their obscene remarks.
A-PLUS

The publicity which has been erected for the forth-
coming Junlor Prom is the finest that we have ever
seen for any class event—Big 4’s excepted. The posters
and the other displays are certainly a. credit to the
Junior class. We were sorry to see that some malicious
individual, or individuals. had to break the balloons
in the lower Richardson peristyle. but this did not
distract too much from the over-all effect. We hope
the Prom will be a success—4nd the publicity will
probably make it so.
NECESSARY

The vote on compulsory insurance. to be taken to-
day. is a very important one. We are ﬁrmly convinced
that State College needs a. form of compulsory insur-
ance and We hope that it is put through today. The
former plans. under which we have been laboring.
are far too insufﬁcient for our future needs. No fu-
ture plans for the expansion of our athletic program
can be made without a compulsory insurance policy.
and the inﬁrmary. for which many have expressed a
desire. cannot be put into effect unless there is com-
pulsory insurance. We must have a ﬁrm foundation
for these projects, and this foundation is compulsory
insurance. Besides being a necessity for these projects.
compulsory insurance also has many beneﬁts in it-
self—the price we pay for our insurance is far lower
than any other similar policy which is offered—and
the beneﬁts which are derived for each individual are.
without a doubt, unparallel. Vote yes for compulsory
insurance.
NEVER

We hope that last week‘s motion to delete the key
line will not appear again in future budget hearings.
The quarrel IS an old one—certain students feel that
$.40 is too much to pay for keys which do not beneﬁt
them; but their arguments never hold up and they
are always defeated. All of us who have been here for
the past three years have seen this question come up
a half dozen times, always to be defeated. We hope
that in the future. valuable assembly time will not
be wasted over this question.

to be interpreted as superfiical ad-
olescent cynicism. These young
people are aware merely that you
