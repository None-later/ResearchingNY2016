STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. MARCH 13. 1933

 

0» Mad 0W SCA, Hillel To Hold Square Dance;

 

Last Thursday night saw the end
of this year's AD Plays. And for
the most part they were very good.

This Reviewer was most impress-
ed with the charming interpretation
of Mrs. Dewey given us by Miss
Wiles. She was most ably supported
by Mr. Lundergan, whose interpre-
tation of the lonely Scotch soldier
was completely satisfactory. The
two of them together gave up a
picture of sadness and joy which
this reviewer will long remember.
Not to be forgotten by any means
were the three charming old ladies
played by Marcia Griff. Doris Hagen
and Joan Carlin, and the well-por-
trayed pompous minister played by
Don Murdock. The technical direct-
or is to be congratulated for one of
the ﬁnest sets produced this year.

The second play was hard-pressed
to sustain the mood left by the act-
ors in the ﬁrst. Madeline Payne’s
interpretation of the dreamy young
girl about to embark on the greatest
adventure of her life struck this
reviewer as entirely lacking in any
real understanding of the part. The
mother. as played by Fran C'ellberti,
suffered from much the same diffi-
culty as Miss Payne. Fran Hopkins
gave at times. a convincing portrayal
of a woman who had missed the
most important part of her life.
Louis Vion also had moments when
he, too. made us believe in a dream.

The third play was a delight. Al-
though at times Tom Smith slip-
ped out of character it was hardly
noticeable, and did not detract from
the total hilarious impression of
English sobriety and calmness. in the
face of calamity. Elsa Brill as the
vacuum- brained wife and John
Laing as her slightly stuffy but un-
derstanding husband. were one of
the funniest pairs this reviewer has
seen in a long time. Marilyn DiNar-
do as the sensible sister-in-law, was
a delight. Equally good. though in
minor rules. were Art Lennig as 001-.
onel Blimp; Alan Weiner and Jan~
ice Smith as the star-crossed lovers:
Robert Woodrow as the speechless
but efﬁcient servant.

To all the people. directors, play-
ers and stage crew who made pos-
sible this years’ AD season, we feel
that we may say THANK YOU on
behalf of the audiences who have
enjoyed the performances. To all we
say a good job. very well done!

JV Squeezes Tangerincs;
Victors In 65-64 Thriller

Juniors Post

Sixth Straight

The Fed J.V. closed its season last
night against the Albany Pharmacy
J.V. in a preliminary tilt. after this
edition went to pres.

On last Saturday the quintet
tangled with the tangerine juniors
and squeezed out a 65-64 win. The
locals blew a 10 point ﬁrst frame
advantage and fought an uphill bat-
tle for the rest of the game. Dead-
locked at the half, 36-36. the squad
missed numerous scoring opportuni-
ties and at the end of the third
canto were on the short end of a
54-47 count. But the never-say-die
boys. who have won their last six
in a row, and nine out of the last
ten, sparked by lanky Erwin Hor-
witz's six points, grabbed a slim lead.
and clung tenaciously to it.

Agran Fails to Tie

Just as the ﬁnal buzzer sounded
Agran of Utica was fouled and step-
ped to the line with his team 1
marker behind, and two chances to
knot the score. However, the prayers
of Bob Hausner. subbing as coach
for the hospitalized John McCor-
mack. were answered as Agran oblig—
ingly missed both charity tosses.

Dee Combs had his most product-
ive night of the campaign to cap-
ture the scoring laurels for the vic—
tors with 19 markers. Three other
Purple and Gold cagers hit double
ﬁgures. Horwitz with 13. and Smith
and Cline garnered ten each. Top
scorer in the tilt was Utica's Joseph
who registered 24 in a losing effort.

gala”

By DORIS DOIIERTY

 

At each basketball game this year
three things happened: the teams
played. the cheerleaders performed
and the spectators watched both. Of
course. the fans were supposed to
watch the team. but they were sup-
posed to cheer when the cheerlead-
ers led them.Why didn't they‘.‘

They didn't cheer because some-
thing is radically wrong with the
cheerleading set-up. The chief func-
tion of a cheerleader should be to
lead the spectators in suitable cheers
at appropriate intervals throughout
the athletic contest.

Do our cheerladcrs lead cheers?
No. they make an attractive forma-
tion. go through even more attract-
ive motions and cheer in time to
these motions with about 2% of
State's fans. These young ladies are
not leading cheers. They're putting
on a performance which the audi-
ence views as such. How about a
little of the old style of cheerlead-
ing—the kind where the cheerleader
faces the fans and leads the cheers?

Are our cheers suitable? In order
to be suitable they must inspire the
players. be familiar to the spectator.
and ﬁt the sport. Obviously. if the
spectators don’t know the words to
a cheer they won't cheer. Still more
obviously. our spectators don't know
the words to our cheers. Naturally.
a player is not going to be inspired
by even the best of cheers if it is
done by an extremely small minor-
ity of the fans—who are supposedly
supporting him. And last of all. the
cheer must fit the sport. A "hit 'em
high. hit 'em low" cheer is obviously
not a basketball cheer. We‘re for
a return to the good old power cheer.
To aid the situation of the fan not
knowing the cheer, we suggest that
part of an assembly be devoted to a
pep rally next fall.

Teams To Meet
In Semi-Finals

The Quarter-finals of the IM hoop
playoffs were finished Wednesday
night. and the school’s four best in-
tramural teams have earned their
way into the semi-finals tomorrow
afternoon in Page Hall Gym. In
the first game Wednesday night, the
Grads showed that they are the
team to beat for the championship
as they trounced APA, 74-56, while
playing half of the game with only
four men. Paul Volk and Mal Wa—
kin hooped 22 and 19 respectively
to pace the Grads, while APA was
led by Jim Bennett with 22 points.

Potter. Indians Win Close Games
The second game. betwaen Potter
Club and the White Eagles. looked
like a romp for the first half. but
a last-quarter rally by the Eagles
almost pulled the game out of the
fire. Bob Ccmely‘s 12 points were
high for the game. which ended in
a 40-30 decision for Potter Club. In
the third game, the Indians nipped
Summit House. 58-52. as the Sum-
mit team sorely missed the services
of their ace rebounder, Phil Schat-
ble. Arnie Schonberg of Summit
hung up scoring honors for the
game with 28 points. while Shotgun
Strauber hooped 23 for the victor-
ious Indians. In the LOFBP-SLS
contest. the Legion came out on top.
47-33. Red Miller of SLS was the
game‘s high scorer with 13 points.
while Doc Miller paced the LOFBP
with 12. Brown and Hausner had 10

Competition

Peds Falter, As
Oneonta Presses
To Win, 89-77

Last night on the Page hardwoods.
State College’s basketball squad end-
ed their season with a contest
against Geneseo State Teachers. The
result of this game was not known
when this paper went to press. but
the Peds were highly favored to wind
up the season with their twelfth
victory as against nine losses.

Three Seniors donned the Purple
and Gold satins for the ﬁnal time
in competition for State College last
night. Captain Bob Taber, Pete Tel-
fer. and Bud Prout are the familiar
faces that will be missing from
State's lineup next year.

State Wins One. Loses One

Last weekend the statesmen had
to be content with a split in the
two games. as they bowed to Oneon-
ta on Friday. but came back strong
to romp against Utica on Saturday.

In the game against Oneonta,
State seemed to have it wrapped up
with only 8 minutes remaining and a
lead of 8 points. Oneonta suddenly
got hot and poured in a barrage of
baskets to win going away 89-77.
Paced by the play of Keith McCar-
thy and the consistent scoring of
Dohm, the Oneonta Red and White
accounted for 34 points in this canto
as compared to only 15 for the
Statesman. Dohm, only a freshman.
hopped 37 points for the night.

The statesmen began to clutch
early in the second half as many
of their shots fell just inches short
of the hoop. but they managed to
stay ahead of the visitors until a
well-timed press really caused the
Feds to fall apart. Nels LaRoe and
John Centra led the scoring parade
for the Peds with 15 and 13 points
respectively.

Peds Come Back to Win 88-67

Saturday night looked at some
times to be a repeat of Friday night's
game as the statesmen again let a
comfortable margin go to waste
early in the ﬁrst quarter. This was
as far as it went though as the Feds
suddenly snapped out of it and went
on to post an 88-67 verdict.

Nels LaRoe hit on a jump shot to
start the scoring in the ﬁrst quarter.
After that it was Centra and Telfer
who built up the 9 point edge for
State. before Jim Greene hit 3 time
from the ﬁeld to cut State's margin
at the quarter to 4 points. the score
