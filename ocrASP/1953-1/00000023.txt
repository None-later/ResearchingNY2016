To Student Association Members
'51-'52:

The 1952 Pedagogue Board is
happy to announce that the often
mentioned but never seen Pedagogue
Supplement promised last year will
be distributed during the coming
week. March 16-20. In answer to the
many “Questions of the Week" and
private inquiries of several individ-
uals, the supplement will be avail-
able to student tax holders of last
year, or in other words, all of those
people who received Pedagogues last
year.

There will be two desks set up in
lower Husted. and people whose last
names begin with the letter A-L
will receive Supplements at one
desk, while the L-Z’s will find Sup-

Identification will be required. and
for identification you may use your
current stduent tax card, driver's
license, or some similiar semi-legal
document. '

You may get a Supplement for a
friend now at the college or for
someone who has left Albany since
June by signing for his copy on the
paper provided at the desk.

Although they may at this time
seem more like a dividend than a
Supplement, these Supplements can
be attached to the back cover of
your yearbook by removing the thin
strip of masking tape from the back
edge and pressing the Supplement
firmly in place.

The Supplements will be offered
during March 16-20 only, and dis-
tribution will be during the hours
of 11 a. m. and 1 p. in.

Faculty members who purchased
copies of the 1952 Pedagogue will
receive a copy of the Supplement
via the college mail.

Council Releases SA To Consider
Announce Plans RecentState Fair Insurance Plan,
For Future Events Gross Proceeds Rivalry Revision

Student Council has released the
ﬁnal ﬁnancial results of this year's
State Fair. The net proﬁt is stated
at $455.17. Expenses amounted to
$44.45 and the gross income was
$499.62. The initial expense money
was provided by Student Council.

Last year's net income was
$555.00. This sum was accounted for
by the fact. that the faculty made
$242.50 with their opening show.
The major proﬁts were made this.
year by the faculty with $144.11
SCAGS with $34.24, Beta Zeta with
$77.00, and Sayles Hall with $33.34.

Possible contributions to make up
the shortage in the Foreign Student
Fund could be arranged by individ-
ual classes, the Council suggests.

Kapner Reports
On Insurance

Last week in assembly, Student
Association considered briefly the
two proposals for compulsory insur-
ance presented to it. In the course
of the discussion several questions
were raised concerning what became
of those who already had insurance
coverage under an individual policy.
Members of SA also brought up the
possibility of having a policy solely
for accident insurance, or of requir-
ing students to pay a health fcc into
:1 student run fund for the College.

As a result of SA's questions Art
Kapncr, local insurance agent, has
investigated further the practicality
of student suggestions. In regard to
establishman of a policy strictly for
accident insurance, last year's claim
records for students of this college
wcrc investigated, and it was dis-
(ovcrcd that, of 720 claims filed, 90
wcrc for accidents. while 630 wci'c
