This past weekend, delegates of the State College
News attended the annual Columbia Scholastic
Press Association conference in New York which
vSA sends us to yearly in order that ideas for better-
ing the News may be gained. Members of the dele-
gation returned feeling rather proud of the News
for having earned a Medalist award, highest honor
which the Association gives. However, upon reﬂect-
ing upon the conference as a whole, we realized
that we had gained many ideas which, journalistic-
ally speaking, had little relation to a press gathering;
that we came away feeling proud of far more than
State’s newspaper. For, during the three day con-
vention, we had it impressed upon us constantly
that we are exceedingly fortunate students of an
exceedingly fortunate college. We returned from the
gathering proud of Albany State. Why? Let us at-
tempt to tell you.

We happened to mention that we were in the
process of revising our SA Constitution. “What
constitutionP”, said one delegate. “We don’t have
one.” “Ours was just handed to us,” said another.
We mentioned going to the printer’s. Oh, the print—
er is in Albany? No, we take a train. Who pays
for it? Student Association Budget. “Budget? We
get our money handed to us. The students have
nothing to say about it.

As usual, several of the meetings degenerated in-
to a discussion of whether or not faculty advisers
and censorship were necessary. Being the only pa-
per in attendance with no faculty advisor and onlv
our own sense of responsibility as censor, News
delegates have always had an enjoyable, perhaps
even gleeful, time demonstrating that neither is
necessary. We discovered that our fellow journal-
ists worked under situations ranging from the school
where the President of the College proof-read the
copy to the passive advisor consulted only for ad-
vice.

In 1940 we ﬁnd the .\'ews commenting to this ef-
fect: "In our four years at State College we have
witnessed a collegiate phenomena-an administra—
tion that believes in a strict lniri'cz-foirc policy to-
ward all extra-class activities. The student body
has appreciated this policy; we have learned by our
mistakes: it has fitted us as teachers for the sec-
ondary schools of this state—we have been con—
sidered adults." l’erhaps many of us do not realize
to how few schools this phenomena has come. And
it is a phenomena. As one conference speaker put
it. college administrations just “put up with" school
publications, that they could abolish them at any
time. just as easily as football or basketball: that
students ought to be thankful for the opportunity
of governing their own affairs, rather than "scream-
ing censor" whenever suggestions from above were
offered

Our conclusion? We are privileged to have the
most comprehensive program of student government
and student run extra-curricular affairs of any we
encountered in our type of institution. Many such
institutions would not even give an assembly of
students the opportunity of "wasting their time."
as some have put it. discussing insurance as you
will be today. We do not mean to imply that “this
is the best of all possible worlds." Certainly. thcrc
is always room for improvement and we. as always.
will actively support any programs genuinely de
signed to benefit this college or its students.

We trust you will excuse our rather stvclli-d
heads; howcvci'. we havc just returned from stack
ing ourselves up against 150 other teachers col-
leges from all ovor the nation. mid we think that
we have much to bc proud of «much that often.
perhaps, we take a little too much for granted.

By FAITH

A faculty member talking before
the Junior Class banquet told of her
experiences in interviewing prospect-
ive freshmen. In answer to the ques-
tion. “What were your interests in
high school?“ the applicant found
the words tumbling from his tongue
His answer to the next question.
"What do you plan to major in at
College?", was short and explicit.
Then the third question. "Why did
you want to come to State Coilege?‘ .
brought the almost invariable re-
sponse. "Because I didn’t have mon-
ey enough to go anywhere else."
Money is an innocent and irre-
proachabie factor entering into the
selection of a college but it cannor
be the whole reason for coming to
a teachers college.

It seems to indicate a lack of
basic purpose on the part of the
majority of persons being interview~
ed. Yet if one does enter into the
program here with no clear [)Ul'llfifif'
or goals. he will be provided. it is
hoped. with many opportunities for
developing a working philosophy
which will lead to worthwhile ac-
ecmpiislnncnts. This is the cry in
the education courses and it is the
reliability of this assumption. which
must be examined on this campus.
that opportunities being provided. a
healthy change in and growth of the
individual will take place.

The problem may be illustrated
by considering two individuals. Rc—
centiy a student. attempted to make
available to the student body an
acclaimed motion picture of great
interest. He planned many month-

HANSON ‘54 ——
in advance for this showing but at
the last minute was thwarted by the
unwillingness of the administration
to help him overcome such a minor
detail as permission to use a sound
outlet for the projector. An oppor—
tunity provided by an individual
with a worthy purpose in mind was
destroyed by the "educators" of this
college. This person was disappoint-
ed and heartsiek.

Another individual with a purpose
had more success during the January
exam period. This person was able to
steal copies of several examinations
and sell them to interested parties.
Rumors ran wild over this situation
and it would seem that. now the
truth will not be known. When the
administration. ironically concerned
at this point with punishing the im-
morality as a deed. while in the ﬁrst
case it did not concern itself with
the pernicious results of disillusion-
ing an individual. called for students
to provide evidencc to aid in the,
expulsion of the guilty party. very
litlc was forthcoming. This individ—
ual was allowed to triumphanth
succeed by the “future teachers" of
this institution.

The mutual betrayal involved in
the two situations is evident.

An atmosphere of indifference ex-
ists about this college to any moral
obligation whatsoever. A member
of Campus ComnnSsion. informing
a student. that it. is against i'cgiiiii-
[ions to smoke in the balls. is told
to go to hell. Maybe what We need
is it raging fire to purge the effects
of the plague surrounding us.

Dear Editor:
In response to the various plcio.
foi' i'f)lll|)lll>(lf')' insurance voiced in

the College NEWS. i should like to
cxprcss llic following \‘it'ws.

Quite naturally. as with any is
siic. there are several sides to this
insurance business. It would be llll~
intciligcnt to tuiiidic it by liilt'lil,'.
.somc .siiy ycs and others say no. to
have them stick by tlicii' tiins iino
go down fighting. A compromise is
clearly called for. in good keeping
\\'illi triic democratic tradition;
iiowcvcr. tiic democratic way Is not
to crush tiic minority with the brute
itii't‘t‘ of the majority vote. Admit-
tcdly. ll coiiipi‘otnisc may not. i'cti-
dcr anyone completely satisfied. but
iicitlicr will it leave anybody coin-
plctcly dissatisfied.

Perhaps it is pos~ibic to appease
all parties concerned by adopting 'I
coiiiproiiiisc plan based on the to!-
Iowing suggestion. ii Divide the in»
.‘iill‘iiilt't' policy into two parts: ill
part one to cover liospiiiilimtioii.
and sickness ib part two to cover
.sinall itcms lit't't'rhiltllliiil culls 'li

WEIGHTY PROBLEM . . .

We would have liked to have seen the insurance is-
sue come to a vote last week. but once again the as-
semny time ran out. Most of you know the pros and
cons of the whole business and will vote intelligently,
This vote should be for compulsory insurance. There
is no excuse left, except that of poverty. and we think
that all can afford to have such a policy. In the long
run. the beneﬁts far outweigh the cost. ‘

EDUCATION?

The letter to the editor last week certainly showed
quite a bit of ignorance and bias. Undoubtedly. many
other people around here are going under the false
notion—that the State of New York is prejudice
against athletics. This is absurd! Use your head Mr.
52'er. the administration takes “donations” from the
State as they come out of the legislature. not as they
need or want them.

LOGIC

The policy of having such things as a rivalry de-
bate in as:embiy should be altered in some way. The
way the future looks. there will not be sufficient time
to cover the necessary Student Association business-—
and yet time is wasted with debates and wrestling
matches. The assembly should take care of SA busi-
ness first and extra programs secondly. As it looks-
now. we are not going to have enough time to fully
discuss budgets. perhaps the most important phase
of our Student Government.

IDLENESS

Why doesn't somebody get on the ball and start.
taking the assembly attendance. Every Friday. sincc
the semester began. only half the orchestra seats have
been ﬁlled. If we are going to have compulsory as—
semblies, why not enforce the law. We've had enough
of this fooling around and doing jobs half way~how
can we carry on effective assemblies? Enough is
enougiiMIet's have some action!!!

KEEP MAJOR-MINOR

We are a little skeptical of the new plan for liin—
iting the number of offices that can be held by any
one Student Association member. The point system
which is being discussed seems to be inferior to the
major-minm' office plan in that it will be too compli-
cated to be very effective. A revision of the old plan
would be a much better idea.

ALI. IIAII. TIIE QUEEN . . .

We hope the. Juniors have a very successfiii Prom.
As far as the Queen goes, we are forced to pick that
black haired b nutty. “Marcia” Chcrnotf. For the atl-
tcndants wo havo lined tip a list. of raving beauties:
"Tootsie" McMainis, "Sugar" Brown. and "Dagmar"
Allasio.

N0 INTEREST

The Athletic Association opening meetings this past
week havc provcii to be less popular than the Mrs-
kania forums. Where is all the athletic intcrcst that
is >Il])iJ()S(.‘(i to be here at State? Perhaps it would be
wise i‘or you to become interested in AA and its ii-
iuincial policics before you find yourself paying an
isccssive atliictic fee.

NOW IS THE TIME

If you are one of the ones who think that the setup
of Myskonia should be changed. you will how a
chance to voice your opinion in tiic forthcoming
NEWS poll. A poll .siicli as this is an excellent. way
for you to havc a chance to show your desires use it.

QUESTION ()l“ THE WEEK

Who has been stealing ’i‘PIl notices from the mail-
boxcs???’.’
