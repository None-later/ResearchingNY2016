GE Researcher
Will Address

Science Conclave

Dr. Vincent J. Schaefer. General
Electric’s “snowflake scientist". will
be the keynote speaker at the first
meeting of the Eastern Colleges
Science Conference at 11 a. m. next
Friday. The topic of his address will
be “Scientific Adventure." Supple-
mentary outdoor films, illustrating
his present interest in rain and snow
making. will be shown.

Dr. Schaefer, a protege of Dr. Ir—
ving Langmuir. who is an associate
director of G-E’s Research Labora-
tory and a Nobel Prize winner: be-
came interested in weather experi-
mentation several years ago. He
made a hobby of observing snow
crystals and soon turned his atten-
tion to the question of what causes
snow to form in the atmosphere. Be-
lieving that a sudden jolt of ex-
tremely cold temperature introduced
into a super-cooled cloud might
turn the trick, he experimented with
dry ice and succeeded in producing
actual snow crystals.

Dr. Schaei‘er is a member of the
American Chemical Society and
holder of an honorary doctor of sci-
ence degree from the University of.
Notre Dame. He is currently serving
as a consultant to the Office of Na-
val Research and the U. S. Research
and Development Board panel on
aircraft equipment.

The Poet’s Road
By ANITA E. LILENFELD '53

A Reason For Existence
The poet's lots to chronicle the
days.
To bring some order out of all
the maze
To load men on to glory and by—

walls.

Reveal the light and brush away
the haze.

'Tis the poet's task to show what
lovers seek. '

His to describe happiness at its

peak. .

Thru him love‘s joy comes to the
strong and weak. '

l-ie paclfles the wild. enjOins the
meek. O

The poet's gift comes straight
from heav'n on high.

His to tell why man must live and

is.
Héllivalks in truth and ought not
' Speak a lie I
For a'poet's gift rest in knowmg
‘Whr.I
' Meekerr
Across the barrier of time.
From out of the full clutch of
' fortune and circumstance.
You come. Like a ship comiiu.
home to port.
All dangers past. you return to
my embrace
EVen then I am tormented——
For the nearness of your body
only ridicules the distance of
our minds.

students engaged in strenuous
sports. to be used for insurancc
against "breakage", Just as science
students are required to pay lab feem
although the recipients of the re—

To ask such is in good keeping with
the traditions of athletic. clubs

The advantages of such 1i coni-

policy would cause a minimum in-

such as Blue Cross, and with othei.
individual policies. 2i There would
be a minimum of coercion and a
relative maximum of insurance cov-
erage available.

The disadvantages are largely
that the students who wish the cov~
crage offered by part one mou-
LiOlleCl above. will probably have to
pay more for it. which. in the light.
of the returns they are getting from
their policies by way of rclmbursw

not unreasonable.

To the Editor:

1 find the feature article on last
week's sport page entitled “An Eye
to the Future." completely distaste-
ful. In the first place. it is one per—
son‘s opinion on a controversial sub-
ject and as such. it has no place in
the paper as a feature column. if
suspect the author‘s name is not the
(no that appeared on the by-linci.
'lhc article is not an editorial nor
is it a royal proclamation. Why then.
is the pronoun ‘ we" used consistent-
ly throughout. the column? 1 am
glad that someone is at least search-
ing for reasons for the lack of spir-
it cvidcnced at State athletic events.
but I find the blame ill placed.

If the fans would keep and use
the mimcographud cheer sheets
liaiidcd out. instead of dropping
them under the stands. perhaps
more than the arbitrary two per»
cent of the spectators could piii'tict-
pate. Surely the cheerleaders can’t.
be blamed for this. if the author of
the article. along with the rest of
SA. would support appropriating
money to our cheerleaders perhaps
an improvement would be evidenced.

JV’; Wind Up Varsiiy Cagers Finish Strong
Starts As

Top Campaign,
Post 11-4 Record

The Junior Peds closed out their
season by trouncing Albany College
of Pharmacy 79 to 67. This marked
the eleventh victory in fifteen
starts for the Juniors. Sig Smith
took scoring honors for the night
by throwing in 26 points. Griffeth
led the maroon and white with 15
points.

The JV lost only four games dur-
ing the season. The Junior Peds
bowed to ABC twice. Papa's All
Stars. and the Middletown Varsity.
The Mdidletown squad eeked out a
53-52 victory. On the other side.

JV’s Rally after Poor Start

After a poor start of three losses
in four games. the Juniors bounced
back to take three in a row. After
a final loss to ABC. the JV racked
up a seven game winning streak
that carried them through the end
of the season.

One factor that contributed to the
Junior Ped's fine season was the
fact that four of the starters had
double digits averages for the sea-
son. Scoring laurels go to Sig Smith
with a 16.67 average. Following
Smith in scoring were Cline with a
13.53 average. Combs’ 12.07 and De—
michiell with 12.07. It is hard to
beat a team when four men can
come up with two column averages
for a season.

McCormick Does Fine Job

While laurels are being passed out.
the JV coach must not be over-
looked. John McCormick certainly
did a fine job of molding a winning
club. John. a student himself. won
the respect and friendship of the
entire squad.

The squad amassed a grand total
of 1099 points for the season. while
their opponents collected only 966.
On the gloomy side. the Juniors
committed 297 fouls in 15 games.
This is almost 20 fouls per game.

I“i'i.|.lr(‘ Prospects Are Good

If this year’s JV is any indication
of things to come. the basketball
i.i'osi:ects for State seem to be got-
ting brighter. Of the 12 members of
the squad. nine are freshmen. Afil'i‘
the few varsity slots are filled next
year. there should be a fine nucleus
for a fine JV squad. Everyone is
looking forward to another fine JV
season next year. Certainly. this
year's squad was great. but we are
always looking for something better.
Next year's squad will really have to
hustle to beat the fine record set
by this year's Junior Peds.

Here is a breakdown of the indi-
vidual scoring for the 1952-53 Jun-
ior Varsity.

it was a matter of a well-practiced
combination of Lidell, Laurie and

freshmen tightened up their defense
