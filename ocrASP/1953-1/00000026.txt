'STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. MARCH 20. 1953

Jean Casadesus

To Transform

Auditorium Into Concert Hall

Next Friday evening all music-lov-
ing students will have a chance to
hear a renowned pianist when Jean
Casadesus will present a concert in
Page Auditorium. In Europe the
name Casadesus has been for gener-
ations a symbol for music just as
in this country Morgan means
money or Ford, automobiles.

Jean Casadesus was born in Par-
is, July 7, 1927. At the age of five
under loving but strict supervision
of his great-aunt, he started playing
the piano. In 1938, although he was
only eleven years old, he entered
the Paris Conservatory as a solfege
student and the same year won the
First Medal.

In 1940 Jean came to the United
States with his parents and settled
in Princeton, New Jersey. Here he
continued his musical studies with
his father, Robert Casadesus, and,
at the same time, began an Amer-
ican education which took him
through four yars at Lawrenceville
and a year at Princeton.

While still at school, in 1946, Jean
won the Youth. Contest of the Phi-
ladelphia Orchestra. The prize was
an appearance under Eugene Orma-

Hutchins Announces
Art Display Plans

The Art Department will feature
a graphic arts exhibit on second
floor in Draper Hall Monday to
Friday. announces Miss Ruth 
Hutchins, Assistant Professor of
Art. Displays of original lithographs,
etchings, dry points, wood cuts,
prints will be included in the ex—
wood engravings, and silk screen
hibit.

These exhibits are placed in the
showcases and on screens in the
corridor in order that all students
may benefit from them, states Miss
Hutchins. The materials for the ex-
hibit will be furnished by the Art
Department and  Hutchins.

 

dy. In October of that year he was
a prize winner at the International
Contest at Geneva, Switzerland.

In 1948 he began a professional
career which since then has in-
cluded successful engagements in
recital and with orchestra in this
country, and tours of Holland,
Switzerland, and France.

Within four years, Jean Cassa-
desus has forged ahead steadily.
Between January 1950, and April
1952, he appeared with 30 American
orchestras. playing concertos by
Liszt. Saint-Saens, Ravel, Mozart,
and Beethoven, numerous solo re-
citals, and appearing with his par-
ents in special engagements, with
the New York Philharmonic-Sym-
phony. and orchestras in Pittsburgh.
Chicago, Cincinnati, St. Louis and
Indianapolis. The three also played
together in Rome and Paris. Every-
where Jean appears, his musician-
ship and personal charm have won
him a devoted following.

Young Jean is, as one newspaper
writer puts it, “a musical chip off
a worthy block." His appearance
here at State should be one of the
outstanding programs of the year.

[Pep' Band To Start

State College in hopes of having a
"pep" band to create spirit at next
year's soccer games, Joseph Patrick
'54, reveals.

There is a special need for many

try out by Patrick. A few trumpets,
clarinets and french horns are

struments need to be furnished by

Report Predicts
Teacher Shortage

The shortage of funds in many
communities will prevent the build-
ing of much needed classrooms to
house the ever-growing number of
pupils in our public schools, the
United States Office of Education
recently stated. All indications show
that there will be a worse shortage
of both classrooms and teachers in
the next few years.

The report handed down by the
Office of Education said that col-
leges are not turning out teachers
fast enough to meet the growing
demand. The report further called
for a study of ways to attract more
youths to the teaching profession
and ways to keep trained teachers
from quitting the profession.

Future Grads To File

SA Will Study
Budget Proposals

The agenda for today’s assembly,
as set by Student Council, will con-
sist of the consideration of six SA
budgets passed by the Council and
Student Board of Finance. Wednes—
day night Student Council devised
a new assembly seating program and
discussed several budgets.

John Lannon '53, President of Stu—
dent Association, announced that the
Council will have to set a deﬁnite
policy governing the use of the Com-
mons because of the confusion that
resulted from its being reserved by
a particular organiation last Tues-
day. The Council passed the budget
of Debate Council by a vote of 1.”
to 1, with a recommendation to SA
to reinstate a $25 High School de-
bate line stricken out by SBF. Cam-
pus Commission's budget was passed
after having been revised by SBF
at the recommendation of SC last
week. Also accepted with new re-
visions was the Forum budget, which
was cut approximately $50 at the
urging of SC. Passed unanimously
were budgets presented by ICC and
Primer. The Council postponed the
discussion of SMILES budget until
a representative of the organiaztion
is present.

Council Alters
Seating Rules
For Assemblies

Wednesday evening Student Coun-
cil established a new system of As-
sembly seating whereby every stu-
dent in the three lower classes (ex-
cept those having legitimate excus-
es) will be seated and Assembly will
be on a non-compulsory basis for
Seniors. In a surprise move Council
voted two weeks ago to retract the.
taking of attendance from Campus
Commission, and, therefore, Council
members will be checking absences.

According to the new system, the
student will be allowed two absences
per semester, or four per year. This
policy will go into effect immediate-
ly. beginning with today's assembly.
The revised seating lists have been
posted and all underciassmen are
urged to check them carefully. If an
excuse for legitimate reasons is de-
sired. Marilyn Wittchen '54 should
be contacted through Student Mail.

A section of ﬁve rows (63 scam)
in the right section facing the stage
will be reserved for Seniors or oth-
ers not seated who wish to attend
and for Council members. All vot—
ing by Seniors and Council members
will henceforth be done by nbsentcc
ballot.
