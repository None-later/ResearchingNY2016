State Mat Men Complete Season

a With An Impressive 6-1 Record

 

Mot Men Paced Sur'n’ Wat/i Multan LOFBP’, Take

By Wolfe With
26 Markers

The State muscle finished up a
very successful season by handing
Middletown a 15 to 10 defeat. This
victory was the same as the boys
from Middletown handed State.

The Middletown win gave the
grapplers an impressive 6 wins and
1 loss. The one loss was at the hands
of Mddletown. The State victims
were Schenectady, Troy, and Dar-
row. The grapplers defeated each
one of these teams twice. The grap-
plers amassed a total of 120 points
m seven meets. Ray Wolfe was
high man for the season with 26
points. Second place honors went to
Lee Negus with 24 points. Wolfe,
Negus. Prindle, and Billings had
perfect seasons. Lee Negus had the
best of the perfect seasons by win-
ning seven in a row.

At a team meeting last week, Lee
Negus was elected captain for the
year. Lee turned in a fine season
this year, and Joe Garcia is ex-
pecting a great year for Lee next
season. Also at the meeting, Ray
Wolfe was elected most "Valuable
Wrestler" for the season. Ray also
turned in some very good wrestling
for State this season.

Graduation will not affect the
club this year. All the members are
freshmen, Sophomores, and Juniors.
Only two of the mat men are Jun-
iors. With some new blood from
next year’s frosh class, and the
strong, experienced club from this
year. the wrestling club should have
a fine season next year.

On the Sports Editor’s desk every
Wednesday night can be found a
list of WAA doings that WAA feels
should appear in this column.
Sometimes We chose to use some of
this material and sometimes not.
Tonight. the list of activities car-
ried the note “Letls use it" in ref-
erence to the WAA news.

Somehow we object to being told
what to "use" in a column that is
reputedly the op‘nion and observ-
ation of one person. The column is
NOT a space for the promotion
and advertisement of WAA activi-
ties. It is NOT a WAA column.

It is true that in the past there
has appeared on the Sports page of
the News a column written by a
WAA council member for the pur-
pose of propagandizing WAA. We
can not see, however, how WAA has
a just reason to complain because
a precedent has been broken. There
is no other council or organization
that employs one of its members to
popularize its activities in the
News. Therefore why should one be
excepted? Does WAA feel above ob-
jective criticism?

As an organization on campus,
WAA is justly worthy of much
praisc.. It gives women a chance to
participate in an activity not cov-
ered broadly in the curriculum. It
is a great advancer of public rela-
tions in that it shows itself well in
playdays with other schools. It
sponsors community projects like
the recent High School playday.
WAA is an outstanding organiza-
tion, but we can not bring our-
selves to agree with some of its
attitudes.

Soltball Captains
To Make Rules

For all those interested in Intra-
mural Softball. it will commence
immediately after the students re-
turn frorn Spring vacation. The
sgn-up sheet for teams is posted
on the M.A.A. Bulletin Board. John
Allasio will be league manager.

A meeting for team captains will
be held next Tuesday noon in Room
101 in Draper Hall. If there is any
change, it will be posted on the bul-
letin board. The purpose of the
meeting will be to discuss division
of leagues. officials, ground rules,
and playoffs.

John Allasio announces that only
15 men on each roster will be al-
lowed.

TM ‘ Hoop Crown

Last Friday night on the Page
Hall hardwoods the LOFBP edged
out the Grads. 61-53. for the In-
tramural basketball championship
of the 1952-53 season. This con-
test met all the expectations which
the final game should meet, as the
two teams exhibited fine floor
games, fair shooting, and tight de-
fenses. Ralph Sausville and Dwyer
of the losing Grads hung up scor-
ing honors for the game as they
each hooped 19 counters.

Brown Paces Legion

However, the all-round balance
and depth of the LOFBP (Legion
of Forgotten Ball Players) proved
to be the deciding factor. The Le-
gion's starting five all hit double
digits. paced by Bob Brown's 14.
The consistent scoring and fine de-
fensive play of backcourt men
Hausner and Fernandez, coupled
with the height and hustle of Stan
Guten and Doc Miller, proved to
be more than the undermanned
Grads could handle.

The losers played a hustling
brand of ball and kept the game
close up until the last three min-
utes, when Lou Ciulla fouled out
and limited the Grads to a four-
man squad. Despite the scoring and
ball-hawking of Dwyer and Saus-
ville, the Legion took complete con-
trol and won going away.

Varsity Hopefuls
Workout For

Coming Season

As the baseball fever mounted on
the national scale, State College's
aspirants unpacked their gloves last
Monday and began to loosen up
their arms for the coming cam-
paign. This year’s varsity nine un-
der Coach Joe Garcia will have un-
til April 24 to round themselves
into shape for the opener against
Willimantic College.

Coach Garcia will have to ﬁnd
suitable replacements for Ken Rut-
ley and Larry Daly, who graduated
last year. Rutley was a ﬁrst base-
man and Daly, a southpay hurler.
Nucleus of Veterans Returning

The loss of only two men means
that a nucleus of seasoned
veterans should make Garcia’s
task an easier one. Herb Egert, Red
McCormick, John Zidik, John Mc-
Cormick, and De Combs, last year’s
hurlers will have Bob Dreher back
as a battery-mate. Around the in-
field, men who played a lot of .ball
last year are Fran Rodgers. Al Can-
non, Bob Sage, and Joe Stella. Can-
non, tabbed Boom-Boom. was last
year’s leading hitter. The outer
gardens will ﬁnd veterans, Don
Lein. Jim Bennett. Arnie Sn:.‘-h,
and Bob DeMichiell returning.

At this early date, it is hard to
tell who among the newcomers will
offer competition to the veterans.
but no position can be labeled as
filled yet.

Last year's squad posted a medi-
ocre 5-6, won-lost record. State on
the strength of more all-round
know-how should up the percentage
to a more respectable mark this
season.

Shumanski Cops
lM Tournament

Last Tuesday at the Rice Bowl-
ing Alleys, Tom Shumanski won the
1M Handicap Singles Bowling Tour—
nament with a gross three game
score of 583. followed closely by
Don Bliss's 580 triple. Other tour-
nament leaders were Jack Wilson
with 579. Ken Rutley with 574, and
Bob Johnson with 549 for three
game scores.

Shurnanski, who led the Thurlow
Hall bowling team into the finals
against the champion SLS team
during the regular season, had a
565 scratch triple featured by a 238

single game. Other high single
games rolled in the tournament

were Ken Rutley's 209. Jack Wil-
son's 201. and Bob Sinkeldam's 199.
Shumanski's 238 single was the
highest rolled in Intramural play
this year.
Doubles Tournament Scheduled
Next Tuesday at 4 p. m. in Rice
Alleys, the 1M Doubles Bowling
Tournament will be rolled. A Mixed
Doubles Tournament is also being
scheduled for the near futm'e.
Ralph Moot. manager of the IM
Bowling league reports that Joe
Duran of the Van Der Zee team
won the trophy for high average
during regular season play with a.
169 average. ‘

By ABEL BLATTMAN

 

The ground hog has his day. He
crawls out, of his hole and looks
around. If he sees a shadow, he
ducks back in. This generally takes
place early in February.

Early in April another type of
animal undergoes a somewhat sim-
ilar reaction. This animal, some-
times called a sports columnist,
sometimes called other names,
crawls out on a limb. He generally
violates all biological law of self
preservation. and keeps crawling
till he reaches the point of no re-
turn. Here we go. . . .

This year in the major leagues.
the teams will finish in the follow-
ing order:

American National
1. Chicago 1. Brooklyn
2. New York 2. Giants
3. Cleveland 3. Philadelphia
4. Boston 4. St. Louis
5. Washington 5. Milwaukee
6. Philadelphia 6. Chicago
7. Detroit 7. Cincinnati
8. St. Louis 8. Pittsburgh

. . . Watch out for fallen timber.
And if that's not enough: Stan Mu-
sial will take the National League
batting honors, Robinson will be
second; Hank Sauer will be home-
run champ. In the Junior circuit,
M ckcy Mantle will win triple
crown! Roberts will remain top ma-
jom league pitcher, and Blackwell
will stage a brilliant comeback.

«Any arguments can be address-
ed to the editor when the forth-
coming baseball seasor ‘
somewhere in Korea.)

UTL.,

The passing of compulsory in-
surance has given added impetus to
the feasibility of bootball. The next
very important step is a positive in-
dication by Student Association
that they still want football added
to the State College athletic pro-
gram. If this indication is quick in
rnateria izing, we feel that the final
steps will be taken very soon.

IM Volleyball

Students Mourn
Lost Holiday

Why all the glum faces?
That's the question NEWS re-
porters were asking as soon as
they viewed the downcast coun-
tenances that pervaded the cor-
ridors of SCT. Detectives were.
hired and they've actually turn-
ed up an answer.

No. don‘t jump to conclusions.
It‘s nothing to do with exam
scandals. nor any other kind of
scandal. State College is in
mourning because the last va-
cation of the semester staggered
away.

“That just can't be!" we cried.
producing this year’s catalog,
Frosh Handbook. and Directory.
In each is plainly written: May
30. Memorial Day, HOLIDAY.
’l‘hc Detectives handed us a cal-
endar. May l953. it said, and
where was the 30th? In the
Saturday column!

But don't blame the adminis-

tration. folks. They tried to give
us a day off.
