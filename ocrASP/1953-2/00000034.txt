From the Hillsdale Collegian,
Hillsdale College, Michigan:
Students at Hillsdale find them-
selves with no student government
—and it’s their own fault. Voting
on a double-ballot, students repeal-
ed the ol-d government constitution
then failed to pass a new one. As a
result, a state of nature now exists
on the campus.

Flood Waters
Hit Brubacher

State students didn’t have to
go to a Drive-in to see "Niagara"
last Sunday night. They had a
private deluge in the basement
of Bru when a brief but inten-
sive April shower visited Al-
bany. Aside from flooding the
Snack Bar and lower halls, the
rising waters also thwarted the
filming of the latest Lennig Pro—
duction. The tide waters struck
just as Arthur's Rank Produc-
tion was ready to roll.

The. effects of the flood car-
rch over until Monday. Bru-
lnuhcr bcllcs went without a
"home-cooked" meal Monday
night, but were consoled by a
dolc of $1.00 per head. Two-
headcd girls had a field day.
(‘ul.l baths and showers were
also the vogue, as were heatless
rooms and unavailable facili-
ties.

By Tuesday afternoon the
waters had receded, and things
were back to abnormal.
