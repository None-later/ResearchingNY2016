Today, you, udent Associatio‘h‘, viii vote
for and elect next year’s SA officers. Let’s
use our reasoning power, not our emotions.
Don’t let this be a popularity contest! Make
this a real election by putting those most cap-
able in office. They will be your leaders next
year—-that thought should be uppermost in
your minds. You have been wanting a more
efficient student government so here’s your
chance to make it possible!

A Job Well Done . . .

Hats off to Student Council and Myskania
for their statement of examination procedure
recommendations presented to the Adminis-
tration. They’ve done a good job in thorough-
ly covering the topic for their obj ectlve hand-
ling of the matter. These recommendations
were done at the request of the Administra-
tion, who expressed pleasure at the excellent
job done. As of yet, the Administration has
not had time to consider the recommenda-
tions, but after consideration in the near fil—
ture by an Administrative committee and a
faculty committee, they will be returned to
Student Council and Myskania in the form
of an Administrative policy on final exami-
nations. Dr. Collins had definitely stated that
when this policy is drawn up, it will be pub-
licized so that in the future students will
know exactly where they stand in relation
to such matters. These recommendations are
the termination of a very touchy subject set
off by the recent examination scandal. Stu—
dent Council and Myskania are to be compli-
mented for handling such a matter so well.

A Day Well Spent . . .

The fortieth annual Moving-Up Day is but
one week away. This traditional day culmi-
nates the activities of one year and starts
the activities of the next on their way under
new leadership. .‘t’s an impressive sight well
worth attending, but in the past few years
participation has been woefully negligent.
particularly in the Senior section. “.Oh,” you
say, “Moving-Up Day is for the Juniors.” It's
not. Moving-Up Day is fo‘ all the classes.
True. the underclassmen are in the limelight
as they move tip to jobs of resl’mnsibility and
there isn’t anything left for the Seniors along
these lilies. but after spending four years
here they should be interested enough ill
their own school to want to know who is tak-
inl,r over the jobs they are leaving and who
will lead Student Association in their place.
It's your last Moving-Up Day. Seniors, don't
pass it by. _ _ I

Myskania has made a careful revtsion of
the Moving-Up [lay program to shorten it
and cut out all unnecessary announcements,
such as organization election results that are
already known. This revision tends to make
the prog‘am more interesting and keeps it
moving along at a steady pace. The old excuse
that Moving-Up Ilay is too long and monoto-
nous can no longer be used.

Participate Ill this Moving-Up [lay no mat-
ter what class you belong to. You won't re-
gret the time and effort.

By JOSEPH

One of th 8 recommendations
brought back from the ESA confer-
ence contained the statement that
State College. as a teachers college.
should participate more actively in
community affairs. Not only do
other colleges have groups similar
to Inter—Group Council and Smiles
doing this type of work. but in
addition to this the students are re—
quired to do a certain number of
hours of this type of community
work for credit courses. The reason-
ing behind this is that the students
preparing to become teachers would
he in a better position to know the
whole child from experiences and
observations other than classroom
observations. While I subscribe to
such a plan and feel that a similar
plan should be adopted at State Col-
lege. I would like to give due credit.
to the two student organizations.
ICC. and Smiles. who are doing
exceptional work along these lilies.

Anyone who has done any com-
munity work realizes the reciprocal
benefits derived from it. First the
community gains from the work
done by the students and iii turn.
the community acknowledges this
tlirotigh the improved good will and
the overall acceptance of the school
as a part of the community. Most
important of all. the individual who
does the work realizes a great deal
of personal satisfaction from being
able to help iliose who are in need
of it,

Inter-Group Council has done al-
most all Of its work at the Clin-
ton Square Neighborhood Hou~e
Students who have volunteered in
the past have found that there is
something magnetic about the work.
and they find themselves continu-
ally going back for more. Some of
the activities that have been undil-
the direction of State College stil—
dents at the Neighborhod house Ill-
ciudc: directing such athletic events
as elementary boxing. softball, and
outdoor games. On Friday night..-
Statc students direct the weekly
dance at the house. bringing ill var-

 

LOMBARDI
led entertainment and acting as
“chapercnes.” I might add here that
anyone regardless of race. color or
creed. can be a member of the
Neighborhood house upon payment
of a token fee. All the members of
the Neighborhood house are divided
int groups according to age. and def-
inite schedules are made up for these
groups and their activities. State
students have been doing work with
all these groups ranging from “Tiny
Tots" to the young adults. There are
groups in the boy‘s shop, story tell—
ing. sewing. cooking. dramatics tthe
Neighborhood house puts on an an-
nual opcretta \inicii s: enls .issistl
canteen work. taking the children on
paper mache work. Lender‘s club.
trips and picnics and many more ac-
tivities which are equally interest-
ing. The Neighborhood House has
sufficient facilities to enable the
students to satisfactorily participate
iii these itneresting activities. The
interested students usually pick the
group that they would like to work
with. and then schedule a time
every week or other week at
which time they meet with their
group and carry their projeciya
through. This is where that mag-
netic qtiality of the Neighborhood
House enters in--—once you start with
a group. you continually look for-
ward to working with them. This is
one of the most satisfying exper—
iences. that. I'm sure. anyone as—
sisting at the house receives.

In writing this article I have trird
to accomplish two things. First to
describe briefly to you the students
the activities that. are going on at
the Neighborhod House and second”
iy. to encourage each one of you to
volunteer your time to working with
either inter-Group Council or
Smiles to take part Ill conic coin—
munity project. There is no better
way to get to know children as they
actually are. to see them work and
play together. than to participate
with them Ill a worthy community
project. You'll find it's more grilli-
f’ying than you could imagine.

A WORD ABOUT VOTING

THINKI

ACR

The All-College Revue. which was presented last
Saturday night was, in our opinion. one of the best
student productions which has been seen at State Col-
lege. We would give most of the credit to the director.
The fast scene changes and the excellent execution on
the part of most of the performers were the highlights
of the show. We must admit that we were a little
skeptical of the whole idea when it was first intro—
duced; but this. the ﬁrst All-College Revue, proves mu;
high caliber productions are possible with a little work.
As it looks now. the All-College Revue may achieve .1
permanent position on the State College social cal—
endar. Whether or not Blg~4's will be back is the ner.’
question. Their future looks rather dim. On second
thought. as much as we hate to say it, the Big—4 ligh‘,
is out.

HERE’S HOI’ING

The sudden burst of energy exhibited by Campus
Commission this past month seems to have burn.
itself out. Arrests have all but disapeared. Maybe lhc‘.‘
can't ﬁnd anyone to arrest. But. it could Just be that
people are keeping the rules; we hope that that is the
situation.

FOR THE FUTURE

The revision committee will probably not report.
until next year. We had hopes that the Constitutional
troubles would be straightened out this year, but ll
would be rather impractical to bring up the whole
thing now and then just leave it hanging over iIlc
summer. Their recommendations will be in accord
with the vote of Student Association taken last semes-
ter. to keep our present system of government. Whrn
these recommendations are adopted our government
will be greatly improved and strengthened.

SOMEBODY CARES

At last some action is being taken to get ashtray:
for the Colnlnons. Student Council is planning to me -
chase a number of new. large ashtrays to take care of
the surplus of cigarette butts always found in the
Commons. The money will come from the Big-4 fund.
When we get them. let‘s use them!

VOTE!

Another thing about voting. This year is the Ill'\l
in which there will be so many people voting absentc.-
All Seniors and all those people who do not have
seats have the right to cast their vote absentee. The
desk is in lower Hiisted. Remember, an absentee liai-
lot is just as good as one cast in assembly.

NO MORE LOST POUNDS

The Lost and Found box is finally burglar proof.
Whoever thought up the clever system deserves 'lli
Oscar for. his efforts. Now we do not have to worrl
about losmg things out of the box as has happened
before. This was a job that needed to be done.
