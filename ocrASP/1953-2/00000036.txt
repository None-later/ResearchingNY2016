but not much more. There were parts
that were extremely well-done and
then there were other parts. Includ-
ed in the first category could be the
ballet with Bobbie Stein. Ann Co-
lumbe. and Ross Hack. This was ex-
tremely effective and the finest piece
of dancing State College has seen
in many moons. Special congratula-
tions to Ross Hack, whose dancing
talent was exhibited for the ﬁrst
time and proved to be very delight-
ful. The scene with Pat Byrne. Jack
Cooper, and Barry Dellafiora was
also well done and one which the
audience especially enjoyed. While
Marilyn Erter appealed to the audi-
ence in her first scene. more of the
same soon proved to be tiresome. A
little bit of this type of number goes
a long way in a show such as this
and "over acting" is not something
to which we are accustomed at State
The trampoline act was a high spot
of the show.

1'0 the Editor:

Last Saturday night we witnessed
the ﬁrst All-College Revue.

Our sincerest compliments are ex-
tended to Louise Petneld and her
committees in making a worthwhile
production out of a poorly supported
endeavor. It was a joy to see both
new faces and new names: but we
were surprised to see many familiar
names absent from the program. It
was also gratifying to see a Mys-
kanla member participating from
both off-stage and on. Despite earl-
ier enthusiasm through voting and
planning. the Revue was forced to
struggle under a series of handicaps
resulting from an appalling lack of
student cooperation. We wish to rc-
mind the student body that lt wa.
their wish to have such a Revue and
that it was only the tireless efforts
of a few that kept this production
alive.

We are distressed at the obvious
"lifting" of professional material
which was not even combined into a
unified and effective script. Wc fch
that a truly original pt‘oductlci.
would be a finer achievement. If in
are going to "lift." why don't we
begin with a substantial Broadway
show. The advantages of the later
would be that. the director wuuid
nave good material to work from and
there would be less chance of bclnt'.
forced to take an inferior script iii--
cause no other was available at thi-

eadline. Despite a royalty fee. we
would be assured of it starting point
and a "name" attraction, We admit
that it good original show gives the
feeling of having worked with onc's
own production from start to finish.
but. original scripts have not 1)i‘t)Vc:l

Despite the above criticisms. w:
feel that initial experiment was not
a complete failure. We do not advo-
cate a return of “Big Fours." nor
do we recommend a continuation
of the present policy. We liked see--
ing “little known people" in "Little
Known Facts"; but. why can’t their
efforts be channeled into a final
worthwhile product that evolved
from a tried and true script?
tNamcs are withheld upon request"
To the Editor:

My hat is off to the “Ali—College
Revue"! Just think of how this "Re-
vue" could mushroom into a reaih
great production. I wouldn't be sur~
prised to see it develop into a major
intcr-dcparttncnt project on the let'-
el of mtich larger, better equipped
colleges.

The argument of prcdomlncnt ur-
pcr-class preferences for parts can-
not now stand up. Be it also noted
that many new faces and much “hiri-
den" talent did come through. Neith-
er were the "unsung" of heros be-
hind the sccncs composed predomin-
titely of undcrcltissmen.

Let's all get behind next year's
production atid back it to the fullest
wcvcn if it’s only a smile or a word
of praise Optimism and cooperation
on the part of the whole student
body would immcnscly help to build
it to gi'ctii heights.

Sincerely.

nificent job on the set for the bal-
let scene. This was definitely the
best set of the entire show. Congrat-
ulations to them also for putting up
the sets for the various scenes with
a minimum of time elapslng. How-
ever, some of the scenes enacted in
front of the curtain while sets were
being changed could have been elim—
inated—it would have been better
to have a few minutes of darkness
and silence than to have recurring
noises out there. which did nothing
to add to the show. A lot of hard
work went into the Revue and was
ruined by too many poor scenes and
too few good ones.

The writer (who incidentally did a
clever bit of writing) and the director
did a fine job with respect to includ-
ing as many people in the cast as
possible and this was especially de-
skrable since it was to be an All-
College affair. but the connection
between the various scenes was rath-
er hard to follow and could have
been bettered. On the whole, the
less said about “Little Known Facts"
the better. Let‘s hope for ﬁner pro-
ductions in the future. but it was a
good start in the right direction.

In in’ princh [us-f iccck.

Dear S.A..

Having a wonderful time. Wish
you were here. Seriously. we really
do wish you were here so you could
see for yourselves the beneﬁts to
be gained from this exchange pro—
gram.

First of all. besides being a lot of
fun for the delegates. it is an ex—
cellent opportunity to strengthen rc-
iations between the colleges in the
New York State University system
This may sound like a lofty ideal.
but stop a minute and think about
our University in comparison to oth-
er state universities such as the Uni-
versity of Michigan whose strength
and unity arises from the fact that
all their activities are centered on
one campus. We. on the other hand
because of a lack of a single cam-
pus to house the various colleges of
our University. find ourselves unable
to maintain a close contact. This
lack of frequent contact has led to
the present state of disunity and
disinterest and. ultimately, to a lack
of prestige—as the saying goes. “in
itnity lies strength."

We feel that this exchange pro-~
gram would be a pessiblc remedy to
the situation. When a student trav-
els to another campus and informal-
ly exchanges ideas with another stit—
dcnt. mutual gains can be made. We
found this to be the case the first
night we arrived here. Talking cas—
ually in the Snack Bar. we hit upon
the Hill)_]('(:t of student govei'iuncnt.
Our hosts were greatly impressed
by our three divisions of studan
government and by our compulsory
assemblies: for their three branches
of government are executed within
one representative body. Some of too
studcnts are hoping to see it rcvt-
slon in their present government and
were particularly interested in ours.
Moreover. We Were called before .i
group comparable to our Studczn
Council to explain more.

(inc iiltcrnoou we visitcd ’l‘wni

I’Icrc thc s‘chool inis crcctcd ll l()(li‘,l'

clittlcs to be used by thc sloth-nix.
As yct. however. no plans have been
mudc for u li‘rcshnmn Cuinp pro-

S.14.. ..

gram similar to ours. A camp such
as this. we feel. would be very prac-
tical for State with our present Frosii
Camp program.

 

We are of the opinion that if this
exchange program were to be set up
permanently at State it would be
very much to our advantage. We sug-
gest. that the Hospitality Committee
of Student Council make all arrange-
ments for the programw—arousing
student and faculty interest in it
and establishing a deﬁnite schedule
for the exchange students to fol-
low. Formr exchange students from
State should work with the Hospi—
tality Committee. offering suggcs“
tions which they found helpful
through past experiences. In order
to make this program the success it
should be. the interest of our faculty
and administration must be amused

rwc were very impressed by the
interest shown by PSTC’s faculty
and administration and the way they
cooperated with the studentsil

Almost without exception, all
pitchers belong in one of two cate-
gories. The first, a “cute” pitcher is
mainly a slow ball hurler. who re-
sorts to cunning change—ups and
plenty of curves. His fast ball would
have trouble making a dent in a
slab of warm butter. He never re-
sorts to burning them by the batter
because he couldn't. so he perfects
his slow stuff, and control.

The second type of good pitcher
is a fast ball hurler. He features
brute power. putting all the muscle
he can muster in almost every pitch.
He doesn’t have to outguess the bat-
ter. because when he is in trouble
he resorts to the high hard one. He
rarely perfects more than a dinky
curve and a harmless change—up.
concentrating mostly on the natural
speed in throwing that he possesses.

It is a rare individual that devel-
ops both of these methods of pitch-
ing. and does so with any great suc—
cess. We remember frotn last year
that De Combs was primarily a fast
bail p.tcher. who had trouble with
con.rol. and no great assortment of
stuif. in his one effort thus far this
year. in a relief role. he showed it
promise of great achievement as a
steoar mounosman. He has develop-
ed a good change of pace. which
when mixed up with his better than
average fast ball is very effective.
l—Iis control was excellent.

We hate to judge a man on only
one game. but we can‘t help being
etithusiasuc over the possibilities
which Combs Showed in thc opener
last Friday.

Red McCormick. the starter in the
game against Willimantic worked
effectively for 5 innings. and dis-
played sharp control. Lack of con-
trol .5 one of Red‘s biggest obstacles
toward becoming a top notch chuck-
c.'. If he can solve this weakness.
the ball Club can look forward to an
untied strength on the hill.

Wayne Oi'crton. in center and
Ray Murphy at first were the only
new comers to break into the line-
up. Each turned in a commendable
performance and should help the
team tremendously this year.

The IM softball league is going
along smoothly this far, the only
factor throwing the schedule off is
the weather. All Albany, Ah weath-
er! The games are played at 4:30
and 6:30 on almost every afternoon
and some of the greatest mis-
matches can be witnessed for free.
Potter vs. APA should be the game
of the year.

The Varsity tilt today against
Plzitisburgh should be a good one,
cspccially if the tpiirdon the ex-
prcs ioiii rivalry between the two
colleges is its hot as it was during
the hoop season.

On Tuesday. John Allasio tied up

15-7 and 16-14 scores.

SLS‘s line—up included Jack

Red Miller. Jim Sheedy. and Tom
Shumunski. APA fielded a team
which included Pete Button. Frank

Budget Views

The AA Board held its final sche-

night in Brubachcr Hall. Again the
turnout was not. as large as the

The main criticism offered by the
people present was concerning the
public relations line. which they
thought could be cut considerably.

Although the rcqcust that AA hold
another open hearing was not tui-

The notice on the WAA bulletin
board asking for girls to sign up for
a weekend at Camp Johnson sug-
i.stcd an experience I had when l
rcirntly visited Plattsburg State
Teachers College. The five delegates
from Albany State were entertained
for an afternoon at a camp site
called Twin Valleys which is owned
by P.S.C.'l‘.

Almost. all of the l’lattsburg stu-
dents We spoke with had never seen
Twin Valleys since it is somewhat
inaccessible. located about 40 miles
from the college proper. Groups of
kids are welcome to organize a
camping party and use Twin Valleys
as we do Camp Johnston. but as yet
there hasn't seemed to be much en-
thusiasm in that direction. Appar-
ently the only users of the site are
students in the camping course and
Field Biology pupils who make field
trips to Twin Valleys.

When we described how students
here organize informal trips to our
camp, the "P1atts’burgites" were very
‘nttrested. They have no WAA or
any organization comparable that
might sponsor such excursions to
make the camp available to more
students.

We personally felt it was interest-
ing to make a comparison of two
similar set-ups and to exchange
idcas about furthering the use of
camp sites.

Red McCormick,
DeCombs Shine
In Pitching Roles

Joe Garcia’s Varsity baseballers
will be gunning for their first win
of the 1953 campaign as they tan-
gle with the Plattsburg State Teach-
ers College nine at Bleecker Stadium
this afternoon. After bowing to a
strong Willimantic team last Fri-
day. 3-2. the Feds should be ready
to bounce back. The extra week of
batting practice should be of some
help. since State’s poor stickwork
was one of the deciding factors in
the loss to Willimantic.

Combs Loses Pitchers’ Duel

This game was a pltchers’ duel all
the way as the two teams produced
a total of only eleven hits. Red Mc-
Cormick started for State and
pitched admirably until the fifth in-
ning. when he tired and gave way
to De Combs. who suffered a heart-
breaking defeat. Combs gave up but
two hits and one walk in the four
innings he worked, but defensive
lapses by his teammates cost him
the game. Willimantic scored the
winning run in the eighth inning
w.th the aid of a hit as the State
infield made three costly misplays.
In the State half of the ninth. Joe
Stella raised the hopes of the State
fans as he crossed up the Williman-
tic defense with a nice bunt. took
second on an error, and advanced to
third on a wild pitch. Relief pitcher
Strazzo. apparently flustered, then
walked Joe Clement. pinch-hitting
for Combs. However, Clement was
cut down stealing. and strazzo set-
tled down to retire Overton and
Sage to end the game.

Sage Triples in First

State drew first blood as they
scored two runs on two hits in the
opening frame. Bob Sage blasted a
long triple into left field and coast-
ed home on Al Cannon's single.
Cannon then stole second, went to
third on a fielder's choice, and scor-
ed on a iniscue by the Willles' sec-
ond sacker.
