“Safe. now in the wide, wide
world.“ These were the words we
sang before the traditional and im-
pressive tapping of the new Mys-
kania began. Rosie and Hal stood
solemnly by and awaited the mo-
ment to announce the name of the
new occupant of seat number one.

And thusly the new. revised. shor-
tened ceremony began. The lucky
thirteen took their places one by
one. with prudent handshaking and
hasty kisses. The first seat went to
Madeleine Payne. who hid her ex-
citement behind bewildered eyes
and a beaming smile. Faith Hanson
was the next to be tapped. Faithie
took the news in her stride, and
calmly let the old Myskie carry her
on stage. Bobbie Newcombe gave up
her seat to Sy Semmler, and by this

 

time we had fears of an all-girl
Myskania.

But not for long. for the next to
be tapped was Neil Brown. who
grinned modestly as he shook hands
with our three lovely ladies, to the
disappointment of all present. A
loud cheer greeted the tapping of
Pete McManus. who also shook
hands demurely. Katie Anderson.
open-mouthed with amazement, was
diargcd by Hodge to the stage to
f .1 Rosie's shoes. Ruth Dunne step—
ped aside as Fran Allen bounced in-
to seat number seven. Annie 0.. ap-
propriater enough. bestowed her
blessing on Little Obey. who said
later that her feeling at the time
was "simply indescribable." Dodie
Donnelly. John Allasio and Pat Dean
were the next three to be named.

Then followed the thrill of the
morning. as JoAnn Doyle. sobbing
and stumbling. kissed all three men
and hugged the girls and took her
place as Coy’s successor. JoAnn
glowed with joy and surprise as the
Assembly cheered Its approval of
her election. The last seat was giv-
en to Marvin Chernoff. who more
than filled it.

The excitement and anticipation
was over. and Student Association
sat back in their chairs. viewed the
beautiful thirteen. and reflected on
their choice. Only guesses could be
made about how the new Myskania
will measure up to the old. Only
opinicns could be offered as to how
well they will work together. But
one thing was sure in everyone’s
mind: they certainly are beautiful!

Committee Will Post
Examination Schedule

The schedule of final exams which
is not yet ready for release will be
miineogrnphed and placed in prom-
inent places when completed. an-
nounces the Committee on Examina-
tion Schedules. which is headed by
Frnnk G. Carrlno, Instructor in
Modern Languages and Charles An-
drews. Professor of‘ Physics.

The committee also reports the
progress innde in its effort to re-
duce the number of exam conflicts
to expedite. reporting of semester
gruch and to maintain a conven-
Icnt distribution of exams. particu-
llll‘ly for freshmen. It has been found
that under the present system
though students were not restricted
by cxIIin conflicts in their choice of
courses, only 15 conflicts. involving
only 36 students were necessary. 50%
of the exam papers had been written
by the end of Wednesday evening of'
the first week. All examination
grades were recorded before the be-
ginning of the second semester
classes.

The committee requests that it be
permitted to continue the present
method of scheduling exams next
year. It is believed that there will
be by then ii basis for arrangement
of exam grouping for use in regis-
tration without restricting choice of
courses.
