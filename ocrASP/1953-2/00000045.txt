4m 04» Ramada

By BOB ASHFIELD

Many people were elected to fill
positions last Saturday, but there
are a number of others which
could never be listed on the MUD
program. Positions like those of a
goalie or center halfback on a soc-
cer team or those of a center or
guard on a basketball team or those
of a pitcher on the baseball team.
We'll all have to wait until next
year to see if there be someone as
versatile and competent at Pete Tel-
fer. Pete. a great athlete, made All-
American honorable mention last
season for his sterling performance
as a goalie. This year Peter return—
ed to the basketball courts and
proved to be the take-charge guy
when the chips were down. Who will
be elected to Pete's position?

Who wll follow in Dean Strick-
land's footsteps and do as much as
he did to make soccer a standout
sport here at State? Not known for
his color on the field. his team-
mates will verify that he is a great
guy to have on your side in a close
game. Will there be another "Red"
McCormick. who was Co-captain
this year with Dean to take over on
the wing position to make it again
a scoring threat? Will whoever suc-
ceeds Red also duplicate his mound
feats on the baseball team. It's a
tough assignment for anyone.

When the basketball season rolls
around. we'll need someone to fill
Bob Taber's position at center.
"Tobe," who was captain of last
year's squad, played 4 years of var-
sity ball as 21 Fed. Whoever is
"Tribe's" successor will have to work
hard to keep the position an effici—
ent one. Bud Prout won't be here
either. End. a transfer. last year
quickly worked himself into the pat-
tern and became one of those valu-
able reserve men that every good
team likes to have on the roster.

Another baseball man, who will
step down at the end of the spring
season is Herb Egert. Herb, a right
handed pitcher. has turned in some
fine games over the past two seasons
for the Statesmen.

Other men who lent a valuable
helping hand to varsity athletics
while undergraduates are Doug Niel-
s'on, manager of the soccer and
baseball teams for the past tw0 sca-
sons. and Joe McCorlnack. who
handled the job of manager in bus-
ketbull for the past couple of sea-
sons also. Tom Bcncnati has wrap-
ped ankles and acted in capacity as
a trainer for the last. time at State.

Another guy who has stepped down
is Abel Blntilnull. my predecessor
as sports editor. 11, is going to bc
fulmy and hard to work without
Abel. whom I turned to so often for
advice. I would like to thank Abc
for all the advice he has given nu-
and the experience than, I have gain-
ed under hiln during the last two
years. I hope I can fill this posi-
tion as efficiently as hc did.

Allasio,lM Prexy
Announces New

Playoff Schedule

Because of the adverse weather
conditions which have prevailed in
Albany since the softball season has
been underway. John Allasio has
announced a new IM softball sche-
dule. Under the old system. each
team would play each other once and
at the end of the regular season the
top four teams would engage in the
playoffs. Since so many games have
been rained out, it was impossible
to finish the league before final ex-
ams started. Now. each team will
play its scheduled opponent twice or
three times, whichever the case may
be. The way the league is set up,
it is a double elimination playoff.
If a team loses two games. it is eli—
minated from the playoffs. There
are some hard feelings about this
system. but if some system hadn’t
been worked out. the season would
have finished without playoffs. 'in
a compromise like this. someone is
bound to feel that they are being
given a raw deal. but it is better to
have someone feel a little put out
than to miss out on the IM cham-
pionships for such an important
sport.

APA. St. Mary's Tie

Under the new playoff system.
APA and St. Marys tangled on Page
F‘icld Wednesday afternoon in the
second game of their series. The
game progressed rather well until
the last inning and then. as usual.
Albany got its daily ration of water.
Big Bob Tabor and John Allasio were
locked up in a 2 to 2 pitchers duel.
Both Tabe and John looked very im-
pressive to the opposing hitters.
Both boys had plenty of stuff and
they had the opposing hitters loft-
ing pop flies to the infield. Dong
Adalnson and Dave Burroughs did
the catching for St. Marys and APA
respectively. This game will go into
the book as a tie and the two teams
will play the rubber match next
week.

(‘Iub Reaches the Biscuits for 33

Tuesday on Page Field, Potter un-
loaded a 23 run attack on the Bis-
cuits. After the dust had cleared
and two Biscuit huriers had been
bombed the final score was 23 to 5
in favor of the Club. Pete Teller
stood aside and Jim F‘lnnen and
Gerry McDonald did the chucking
for the Club. These two will tangle
Thursday in the second game of the
playoff series.

Monday night on Page Field, the
heretofore winiess APAchies bent
the Haysccds 7 to 3. Bob Straubel'
went all the way for the APAchies
and Dick Kirsh took the loss for the
Hayseeds. Ed Steele and Bugs Ever-
:u'd did the catching for the winners
and losers respectively.

Monday afternoon on Page. APA
bombed the St. Marys DPs for 17
runs. St. Marys got only two runs
off John Allasio. John Eldridge and
Bob ’l‘abor did the pitching for the
losers. Davc Burroughs and Charlie
Cullen worked behind the plate for
APA. while Doug Adnmson went the
l'()1ll for the losers.

WAA's last social function of the
college year will take place this
weekend at Camp Johnston when
the Spring Spreers take over. There
will be food and fun and awards and
should prove as always to be a good
get-together.

We were pleased with the slate
of WAA officers announced last Sat-
urday on Moving Up Day. Last
year's officers can justly turn away
from their duties feeling they have
left a job well done, and they should
feel assured that they have entrust-
ed their duties to capable hands.
Very best of luck to the newly elect-
ed officers.

It surprised us somewhat to find
that the WAA budget submitted to
Student Board of Finance met with
scme questions. The recommenda-
tions made are probably workable
and plausible. It is conceivable that.
either the system of making awards
be revised by WAA to cut expenses
or else less expensive awards could
be purchased. WAA would probably
be more than willing to cooperate
with such a measure. We are in faVOl
of the cheerleaders receiving recog-
nition for their efforts in the form
of some sort of an award, although
the honor attending such a position
is great.

The outcome of the motion made
ill last Friday's assembly should
prove interesting.

If WAA is not allowed to give
awards to those girls who accumu-
late the designated hours. a certain
core will be removed that makes
WAA organizations workable. Re
move this and you remove some of
the effectiveness of WAA.

And now at the end of this, our
last column may we say that in spite
of the ups and downs. the writing
has been a pleasure. A bid of
thanks to those who have made it
pleasureable.

Mud Activities
Reach Climax

After Jupiter Pluvius got car-
rlcd away last Wednesday eve-
ning some State Students went
on a spree themselves. The fes-
tivities were centered around
Dorm Field and Beverwyek
Park, and consisted of coed wad-
ing, track and field events.
baseball. and football. Joe Pur-
dy nipped a fine softball game in
the bud. but the aspiring aili-
lctes retired to licverwyck Park
to continue operations.

gutors were ()verton. Inglis.

WAA Plans
Sports Wind-up

The high light of WAA sports sea-
son will be the annual spring spree
held at Camp Johnson, Chatham,
New York. A bus will leave from the
front of Pierce Hall at 10 a. m.. Sat-
urday. May 16 and will return in
time for supper around 5:30 the same
day. The highlights of the day’s
program will be softball, badminton.
swimming (don't forget your bath-
ing suit and an extra pair of shoes-
in case you fall in). and horseshoes.
A lunch will be served by the offi-
cers of WAA. At the end of the day
awards will be given to all those who
have earned credit hours. and the
newly elected officers will be in-
stalled. The program will be held
RAIN or SHINE! The sign up sheet
for all girls is posted on the WAA
board. Barbara Stemple is in charge
of this program and she urges all
those interested to come.

Those who do not have full credit
at the time awards are given may
still earn hours in the two remain-
ing school weeks.

Another inter-collegiate playday
will be held at the Green Mountain
Junior College, Saturday, May 23rd.
It is the last meet of the season
and will be held for softball honors
between State and surrounding col-
leges. The team has been chosen and
will be posted on WAA Bulletin
Board.

Due to the rainy weather not too
many girls' sports have been held
WAA announces that girls may
turn in their hours for tennis and
softball any time they play. These
hours do not have to be supervised.

Co-ed badminton is still being held
in the gym every Tuesday and
Thursday from 7-9 If interest in
this sport continues a mixed tourna-
ment will be held next year.

The ping-pong tournament has
finally been completed. Lou Urbano
and Ruth Richter are the doubles
champions.

Archery will be held on dorm field
every Monday and Thursday after
school from 3:30-5:30, if the weather
permits.

All tumbling hours are to be fin—
ished up this week. WAA hints that
advanced tumbling and beginning
tumbling will be sponsored next
year. Life saving still continues at
the Jewish Community Center.

WAA has the necessary equipment
for golf. so practice up.
