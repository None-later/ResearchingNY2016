Frosh Fling
Precedes Grind

Approximately 220 of 57's fe-
males got their first taste of
higher education last weekend
as they helped 33 timid upper-
classmen take over Lake Burden
for State‘s annual pre-test fling
for fresh.

The new arrivals proved quick
to adjust themselves to the
hazards of camp life. Although
there were no serious casualties.
the usual epidemics plagued the
area — pajama-stealing. insom-
nia, and laryngitis being among
the most prevalent.

Education triumphed when
one counselor and two of her
wards learned how to propel a
paddle-less canoe. but the fresh
conquered when they met the
counselors in a softball duel. In
spite of invaluable faculty as-
sistance. the veterans were
squelched.

Next opposition — the yellow
Jackets of '56.
