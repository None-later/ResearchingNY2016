Statesmen Set Up,Housel<eeping At Luxurious HilltOp Apartments

The advent of the new shiny white
bucks and the sharply creased flan-
neis belonging to frosh at State also
brought the changes in housing. Due
in part to the influx of so many
trash and due, too, to the desire of
statesmen and Stateswomen to have
a change of scenery, many new
homes have been acquired by State
fraternities and sororities.

Although they may not be far
above Cayuga's waters, or although
they may not be the zenith of style

and comfort, thirty new additions to
State have set up housekeeping with
John Lannon ’53 as house "director"
at Hilltop House. Just across the
road from Hilltop is the second new
grand opening at St. Mary's, in the
form of Ridge House. the dorm
housing grads and veterans. The
Summit House is open again, this
year housing mostly Sophomores.
In the fraternity-sorority spot-
light, Chl Sig girls are asking, “Have
we got it or ain't we?” (their new
house. of course). As yet they don't

seem to be sure, one way or the
other. Sigma Lambda Sigma resi-
dents have transported their house-
hold to 1011 Madison Avenue. while
Alpha Pi Alpha residents also have
changed to Madison. conveniently
near Newman Hall. The SLS men
also have St. Rose girls as their
neighbors.

Miss May McCarty is housemother
to fifteen new Frosh women at Col-
lege House, the site of the old APA
house. To the neighbors who are
used to having APA near, this must

be strange indeed.

Ar .‘u. ugn you may ask: Will John
i-annon live to face another day with
his faithful frosh on Hilltop? Will
Chi Sig and Gamma Kap girls re-
concile themselves to having a girls
dorm ir. their midst? Will SLS men
transfer to St. Rose, and APA men
find Newman Hall close enough?
Will the Thurlow girls be lonely in
the park? Will KS find a house
that doesn't freeze up in winter?
Just remember that things . . . well,
thinrs are things, aren't they?

 Releases
New Regulations
For Game Room

Murals To Decorate
Walls Of Snack Bar

New rules have been established
for the Student Union concerning
the game and activities rooms.
Students in the Snack Bar will view
murals next week, announces Mary
Ann Reiling '54, Chairman of Stu-
dent Union Board.

New Rules For Union

The new policy governing the
game room and Student Activities
Rooms is as follows:

I. Students who play cards in
the Game Room may take food lll
there. Only those who wish to play
cards may do so. Dirty dishes and
rubbish must be returned to the

 

Alarming Fire
Foils Femmes

No. those weren't the red
devils invading the Gamma Kap
house Wednesday. but the Al-
bany Fire Department. Two
shiny fire engines came to the
rescue of the damsels in dis-
tress.

For some time it appeared as
if the girls had installed a sub-
terranean turkish bath as the
steam and hot water poured
forth. When the walls began
to shake and the dishes rattle,
the time had arrived for action.

In the face of danger Marie
Elder undertook the task of
battling the belching basement
furnace. But the conventional
bobby pin and chewing gum
failed. The emergency valve
was causing the catastrophe
and the Scotch tape wouldn‘t
hold the damper door shut.

Now the gas masks are back
in storage and the tide has
