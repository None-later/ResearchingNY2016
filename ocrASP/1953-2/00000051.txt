Statesmen Set UpHousekeeping At Luxurious HilltOp Apartments

The advent of the new shiny white
bucks and the sharply creased flan-
nels belonging to fresh at State also
brought the changes in housing. Due
in part to the influx of so many
fresh and due, too, to the desire of
statesmen and Stateswomen to have
a change of scenery, many new
homes have been acquired by State
fraternities and sororities.

Although they may not be far
above Cayuga's waters, or although
they may not be the zenith of style

and comfort, thirty new additions to
State have set up housekeeping with
John Lannon ‘53 as house "director"
at Hilltop House. Just across the
road from Hilltop is the second new
grand opening at St. Mary‘s, in the
form of Ridge House, the dorm
housing grads and veterans. The
Summit House is open again, this
year housing mostly Sophomores.
In the fraternity-sorority spot-
light, Chi Sig girls are asking, "Have
we got it or ain’t we?" (their new
house, of course). As yet they don't

Alpha Pi Alpha residents also have
changed to Madison, conveniently
near Newman Hall. The SLS men
also have St. Rose girls as their
neighbors.

Miss May McCarty is housemother
to fifteen new Frosh women at Col-
lege House, the site of the old APA
house. To the neighbors who are
used to having APA near, this must

When you smoke Chesterfield it’s
so satisfying to know that you are
getting the one cigarette that's low
in nicotine, highest in quality.
A fact proved by chemical
analyses of the country’s six‘
leading cigarette brands.

 

And it’s so satisfying to know that
a doctor reports no adverse effects
to the nose, throat and sinuses
from smoking Chesterfield.
The doctor’s report is part of
a program supervised by a
responsible independent re-
search laboratory and is based
on thorough bi-monthly exam-
inations of a group of Chester-
field smokers over a period of
a year and a half.

Al 'u ago you may ask: Will John

his faithful frosh on Hilltop? Will
Chi Big and Gamma Kap girls re-
concile themselves to having a girls
dorm it. their midst? Will SLS men
transfer to St. Rose. and APA men
find Newman Hall close enough?
Will the Thurlow girls be lonely in
the park? Will KS find a house
that doesn't freeze up in winter?
Just iI-member that things . . . well,

Alarming Fire
Foils Femmes

No. those weren't the red
devils invading the Gamma Kap
house Wednesday. but the Al-
bany Fire Department. Two
shiny fire engines came to the
rescue of the damsels in dis-
tress.

For some time it appeared as
if the girls had installed a sub-
terranean turkish bath as the
steam and hot water poured
forth. When the walls began
to shake and the dishes rattle,
the time had arrived for action.

In the face of danger Marie
Elder undertook the task of
battling the belching basement
furnace. But the conventional
bobby pin and chewing gum
failed. The emergency valve
was causing the catastrophe
and the Scotch tape wouldn’t
hold the damper door shut.

Now the gas masks are back
in storage and the tide has
gone down with only a few
damp spirits remaining.
