Here's a recipe for a teacher
from the Buffalo State Record,
prepared by James Marshall, long-
time leader in educational affairs

, in New York City:

Select a young and pleasing per-
sonality, trim off all mannerisms
of voice, dress, or department.
Pour over it a mixture of equal
parts of the wisdom of Solomon,
the courage of Daniel, the strength
of Samson and the patience of Job.

Stew until done in a hot stuffy
classroom, garnish with an inade-
quate salary and serve hot to an
unappreciative community.

Record repeat—the cigarette test.

Two ‘little boys were Sitting be-
hind a board fence making a cig-
arette test. ": One said to the other:

“Take a deep puff of one, inhale,
blow out the smoke. Now the oth-
er one. Tell me, friend, which
one made you sicker."

The Daily Kansan reports that
after all the rough and tumble of
new student orientation week, one
bright young freshman said,“Well,
that wasn’t so bad. Now where’s
my degree?"

Following is a poem by Betty
Herrala found in the Geneseo Lam-

 

 

ron.

To The Freshmen

Freshmen must respect the Seniors,

Juniors and Sophomores too——

For they are the “Fresh”

And know not what to do.

All house rules and suggestions

Must be obeyed by college fresh-
men——

Books are opened; quiet at eight.

Home by ten-thirty from weekday
date!

But freshmen need not worry

As upperclassmen do

When in a fire drill,

Where to turn;

For they are the “frosh”

And are too green to burn!

Physchology class at Coe College,
Iowa, is really progressive. A word
association test was being given
with the usual dog-cat, black-white
examples. Then the prof came up
with "love". Ventured a timid
student, “Neck?”

From The Wesleyan Transcript
of the Wesleyan Institute, we notice
this little poem about women's
fashions:

Girls when they went out to swim
Once dressed like Mother Hubbard
Now they have a bolder whim;

They dress more like her cupboard.

From The Iloughton Star. llough-
ton College. Just a little poem—

RW’  Rag

By RAY WOLFE

 

Hearing lots of talk lately about
the coming IM Football season, in
which at least five teams are, I‘m
told, going undefeated. This seems
highly improbable. however, in view
of the fact that there are only
two leagues. Maybe this is due to
the shortsightedness of Manager
Tom Hogue, who, by the way. gets
a big hats off from this corner
for a very speedy and efficient
job of organization.

Last year’s champion Potter Club
figures to be tough again but they
will have to come tip with some
lulus to replace Brown, Carlo,
Schaertl, anti Champlin. The club
will be very strong down the middle
with such season performers as
Patti Ward, Walt Barbash, and
“Hess” Egert in the line and Bob
Sage and Paul Victor in the back-
field. Also Morrissey.

Kappa Beta, one of the top teams
last year, will feel the loss of All-
Star center Ed Cummings as well
as the Ryder-Wander passing com-
bination. I figure KB will bring out
a good team based around Sturmo,
Abel Blattinan, and Herby the
Head.

Rumor has it that the Lancaster
Street vets are instigating a team
which will average about two hun-
dred pounds anti should beat any-
body. 'l‘hcy do have an impressive
looking lineup, with eight of the
nine starters possessing football
trophies from I'odunk III. I hear
that Joe O'Ilcaney has offered to
back this outfit by supplying them
with new sweatpants, so they could
be tough. I predict that Hughes
and Company will start at least two
games.

To get back to the serious con-
tenders, SLS looks ready for a real
good season. This squad is really
due; they have the weight and
aggressiveness to go all the way if

their offense clicks. Backs like
Mousse. Howlctt, Hllsinger, and

Sapko, operating behind a real hefty
line. could click. It appears that
the Great Corsi is the dark horse
on the SL8 outfit. and will be the
man to make or break the team.

APA figures to be a much iln-
proved aggregation with a whole
new backfield anti :1 heavy and
experienced line. Any team could
use three of the all-star backs se-
lected by this page last fall. namely.
Bob Drehcr, Chas. Dcrwln, and
Bos Strauber. These three, plus
some unknown quantity, make up
a relatively small btit potent back—
field. With big Jim Bennett and
Captain Fox at the ends, the APA
team looks well-balanced and should
be hard to stop.

I have seen nothing and know
less of the dormitory and inde-
pendent tcams. although they will
probably show the :ilnuidancc of
hustle but woeful lack of talent
usually displayed by dorm outfits.
In view of the above statistics I
will stay on safe and solid ground
ill my predictions:

l. Potter (‘luii and APA roll over
their respective leagues.

'1. AI'A takes the chili by two
touchdowns in the season finale.

3. The Vets sell their sweatpants
for :1 bucks. a pair (second

hand); and each one hooks 20

at O'IIeuIIcy's. After their first

game.

To get away than the topic of
football, and to make a few more
enemies. l‘d like to spend a few

lilies to criticize the l'rosii. bolli
utlilclic~wisc and social wise. There
must be some talent in the Class
of ‘57 but i have yet to see it.
Maybe I study too much, but it
seems there lll‘t' very lcw i'rosii go—
ing anywhere or doing anything.
Now everybody knows that illt‘
freshman class is supposed to be
the cockicsl. hot doggicsl outfit iii
the school. so it would look good
if some ol llit'lli would get on the
bull. Now don‘t gct lllt‘ wrong. I
have nothing against pounding the
books, but there in a lot more to
College life than Just beating your
brains out.

Soccer Hopes

Last week in this coltunn was
presented a run-down of some of
the men who will be forming the
nucleus of our soccer team this
fall. Not to be forgotten, though,
are the men who with a year or
two of experience, will be the back-
bone of future teams.

Three men who saw some action
last year and will probably see
more this year are Jack Hughes,
"Rebel" Hockmuth and Joe "Down-
beat" McDowell.

Jack. a Sophomore from Am-
sterdam, has 5 years of soccer un-
der his belt; 4 in high school, and
last year's experience. At W. H.
Lynch High School he also put in
a year each at basketball and base-
ball.

Rebel, though put out of last
year’s season with an injured eye,
also has a, lot of soccer experience
behind him; with 4 years at high
school and 2 in college. A couple
of years of track and wrestling
have served to keep him in pretty
good shape. He is a Sophomore
from Wappiligers Falls.

Joc McDowell, a Junior hailing
from Elizabethtown, played 4 years
of soccer. 4 years of baseball, and
ii years of basketball at Elizabeth-
town High. Here at State. he's had
2 years of soccer and 1 year of
baseball.

Will Bosch, also a Junior. played
a year of soccer at Otisville Union
Free High School in Middletown.
He's played for 2 seasons with the
Statesmen.

Bob Davidson, a transfer from
Colgate. has a year each of college
soccer and track behind him. Dur-
ing his high school days in Ellen-
\illc. he played 2 years of soccer,
4 years of basketball. and 3 years
of track.

Bernie Flaherty, another Soph
here from Utica Catholic Academy.
in going out for his first try at
soccch In high school. he played
a year of basketball and 2 of foot-
ball.

Earl Butler, a i‘rcslnnan up from
Ellcnvillc. is in good condition
after 4 years of high school soccer
and track.

Phil Schatzle. up from Haldane
in Cold Spring, is giving soccer a
try in his Sophomore year. In back
of him he has 4 years of high school
track. 3 years of football, and 2
years of basketball.

John Place, another Sophomore,
out for his first year of soccer, is
from Hudson Falls. While there,
he played football for 3 years, ten-
nis for 2 years, and track for l
_\'t‘ill'.

To Start Season

The Intramural Football League
will begin its l953-‘54 season early
next week, reports fl‘om Hogue ‘55,
Commissioner of ‘the League. This
year. as in previous years, there
will be two leagues running con-
currently: a Beverwyck League
and a Dorm Field League.

There will be ten teams vieing
for the championship of the school,
five teams hi each league. The
ten teams are: Potter Club. APA,
SLS, KB, Mustangs, ’5'? Red Devils,
Sayles Bargains, Suinmlt House,
Van Derzee. and the Vets.

Rules To Remain Static

The rules for this football sea-
son will be practically the same as
they were last year. Despite the
change in intercollegiate rules
e.lmlnating unlimited substitution.
Stale teams will continue to oper-
ate under the old two—platoon sys-
tem allowing substitution after
any or every play.

There has been one rule change,
however. This year each team will
be required to have a minimum of
twelve players, and allowed to have
a maximum of fifteen players on
its roster. Another practice being
instituted is embodied in a rule
allowing any captain whose team
has a full roster to drop a man

from the squad if he misses two
games in a row. This rule should
help to eliminate many forfeits

caused by the presence of inactive
players on team rosters.
Teams ’l‘o Supply Managers

This year every team will be re-
quired to furnish a manager at
each game. The manager may be
either a member of the team or a
non-purllcipant.

The official duties of the lllllll-
tiger will be to keep a list of all
his team‘s players who show up for
the contests, keep complete team
statistics for each galne and assume
charge of substitution at. each
game.

One special ditty which each team
captain must perform is to pro-
vide scrimmage vests for the play-
ers at every game. These vests are

necessary in order that the offi-
cials may distinguish the mem-
bers of one team from their

opponents.

Hogue announces that any team
which has not yet signed up to
play should contact him through
stlidt‘llt mall immediately. If sev-
eral other groups decide to field

Bolster Squad

With the season’s opener against
Queens College on October 3 fast
approaching, the junior varsity as
well as the varsity soccer teams are
bearing down‘ln a rough schedule
of practice sessions. 'In prepara-
tion for this game Coach Garcia’s
men are being pitted against out-

side opposition in scrimmage games

this weekend.

To Scrimmage RP]

Saturday afternoon will find both
State squads meeting the RPI’. En-
gineers in what should shape up
to be a tough scrimmage. Also, the
Varsity has lined up a scrimmage
game agains the Arlny JV's. This
contest is due to get under way
at 3:30 Wednesday afternoon at the
West Point Military Academy.
Ail-Americans Return

The Varsity squad has been
strengthened by the return of three
valuable returnees who were on the
doubtful list. two of whom received
nominations for last season's All-
American lllCCC‘l‘ team. These two,
Jack Hughes and Ralph Adams.
should really tighten tip the full-
back siots. The third is Dick
Bailey, an experienced wingman
who was not attending State during
last year‘s soccer season.

Garcia has been drilling the squad
on fundamentals recently. with ex-
tensive practice on such maneuvers
as passing, dribbling. and shooting.
Twice during the past week Garcia
has run the candidates through
inter-squad scrimmage games to see
how the boys react under actual
playing conditions. The practice
games against Rensselaer Poly and
the West Point Cadets should be
useful in helping the players get
used to acttiai intercollegiate coin-
petition.
l'lttycrs‘ Assistants Wanted

Althouin the starting lineup is
pretty well shaped up, Garcia still
needs players and will welcome
anyone who is interested in coming
out for soccer. regardless of pre-
vious experience. Garcia has also
sent otit a call for managers and
trainers. Althouin a few men have
reported for these positions, he is in
urgent need of more. Those iii-
tercsted should contact Coach Gur-
cla at the Coach's office in Page
Hall. ‘

Garcia has been favorably llll-
pressed by the showings of many
new transfers and freshmen. Many
of them have good chance.» of null-
ing down u starting berth, including
John Pengclly. Bill Liiicibcrg. John
Lindberg, Everett Wciel'mullcr. Al
Hockicin. and Marvin Llisclc. With
all this talent, plus the experienced
veterans. the State team should
t'tiillt‘ through its touch schedule
with flying colors.
