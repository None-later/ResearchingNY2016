An Old Idea . . .

Rivalry is one of the most deeply-
entrenched traditions at State. Through-
out its long and successful history It. has
undergone many changes, some slight,
some radical. Tomorrow begins. a new era
in that" important phase or orienting the
freshmen to the forkways of our .couege.
In place of the year-long competition ter-
minating on Moving-Up Day, the class of
1957 will fight and sing its way_through a
Rivalry that extends from ActiVitles Day
until Campus Day. This marks one of the
most radical changes in the traditions of
State since the banishment of those fondly
remembered farces, the Big-4’s.

The purpose of condensmg the schedule
of events and compressing rivalry into half
a semester was to lighten the ' extra-
curricular burden of the partimpating
classes in order that they may concentrate
more thoroughly on academic tasks and
the more constructive activities offered by
our broad schedule of extra-class events.
Whether or not the new plan will fulfill
this purpose is a question that cannot be
answered until the awarding of the Rivalry
Cup in November. ‘

We entertain the idea that the benefits
gained by such a program will not balance
its drawbacks. Rivalry, to us traditionalists,
was not a drudge of work for such a tight
program. It was a time to learn the traits
and patterns of our new envn‘onmentpto
meet classmates and class rivals under 1n-
formal and purposeful conditions. We are
not so old and care-burdened as to have
forgotten the long rehearsals in prepara-
tion for our own big-4 and Moving—Up-Day
skits, the fun of cheering our rugged and
fearless representatives through pushball,
the exciting tension as our rivalry score
fell behind, then balanced, and then de-
feated our opponents.

The decismn was made, the schedule has
been arranged, and tomorrow is opening
day. Before we realize it, the best chance
our frosh have for a raison d’etre here at
State will have terminated. Then will be
the time to review the past, to compare
the results and to propose the changes.

A New Idea . . .

In past years, it has been the custom for
State College News to print anonymous re-
views of the AD plays, usually written by
students who have shown interest and
ability in dramatics and critical writing.
This week begins a fresh policy for the
New’s drama department. Commencing
with this issue, we are running a column
devoted completely to the news and re-
views of theater happenings here at State.
We feel that there is enough material and
enough interest to warrant this change in
policy, and would welcome any correspond-
ence that would enlighten us concerning
its reception by Student Association.

This column has no connection with,
and is not sponsored by Dramatics and
Arts Council. As with sports page, it is
supported by News with the purpose of
keeping SA members better informed about
the gomgs-on at our college.

We believe our idea is off 1.0 a good start
today. We would like to know how the
rest of you feel.

By ATYAAT NASIIED

Education in Egypt is similar to
that in the United States. We
have the elementary school, the
junior high school and the senior
high school. beside the universtiy.
We have, as well, the grade sys-
tem. The first, second, third and
fourth grades are within the ele-
mentary school. The fifth, sixth,
seventh and eighth are in the jun-
ior high or preparatory school. The
ninth, tenth and eleventh are in
the senior high school. The ele-
mentary school and the high school
are free. We call it general educa-
tion, which is accesible to all class-
es and compulsory to a great ex-
tent. Co-education takes place in
the university only. The school
provides the students with all
equipment, such as books and tab-
lets. Lunch is also provided, which
contains two sandwiches, some
milk, some kind of fruit or some
nuts and sweets, free.

We used to have exams in the
primary and junior high school.
Two years ago a new examination
system, built upon simplifying the
matter was introduced. Each school
forms a committee consisting of
head master and teachers to de-
cide whether a pupil will succeed
or fail without any formal exami-
nation.

Promotion depends on, first, at-
tendance for at least 80'; of the
school period, and second, a satis-
factory average mark, calculated
for oral, written and practical work
done by the pupil throughout the
year. The passing mark is at least
50'; of the maximum mark for
every subject, and in technical
schools it rises to 60'} in purely
practical subjects.

Social Aspects of the Iliin School

With the help of research work
in education, it was found that ex—
trucm'ricular activities besides the
clubs and camps are the only way
to let the student get acquainted
with his school and his coiinnuiilty,
besides it solves the problem of
leisure time. In the Ministry of
Education there is a whole depart-
ment which gives full attention to
these aspects. Each school has the
opportunity to have athletic and
non-athletic, scholastic and non-
scholiistic nctivitics. Hobbies are
given a great deal of nttcntion in
the school. There are regular
meetings ior these ehibs twice it
work for three or trim hours. on
Monday and 'l‘hursdiiy, under the
supcrvision of ll. responsible touch-
or. The department in the M111-
istry which cures for leisure-time
ill'i.iVltll'.‘i organizes ccrtuln inter-
scholustic uctivitlcs in the follow-
lIll.’, Hl‘lilllii‘ii
Young l'coplc's I‘lubs:

These are organized iii the schools
wlicrc the buildings allow this. The
principal of the school nets us it
club president and is aided by su-
pervisors for cultural, physical and
social activities, as well as trainers

 

in the various hobbies practiced by
the club members. The attendance
in these clubs is for any pupil who
lives in the same area of the club
and who attends any high school.

Clubs Outside of School Buildings:

These are organized for a whole
town; they are such clubs as swim-
ming. cricket, etc. Usually they
are used by the public and on cer-
tain days by the pupils.

Camps:

In the mid-year vacation, which
is about fifteen days long, and
duringr summer time, pupils are
taken to camp. The ancient towns
of Luxor and Aswan are used at
midyear, while summer vacation
camps move to the sea beaches.
In either case pupils are encour-
aged to observe the condition of
the locality, to study the problems
of its people and to suggest effective
reform.

Foreign Travel:

This idea began in 1951 by a trip
to Lebanon. The results were so
encouraging that last year and this
year, high school boys and girls vis-
ited Lebanon, Italy, Spain and
Soudan.

I would like to mention that the
share paid by the pupil for these
camps, clubs and trips is very lit—
tic. The only reason he pays any—
thing is to let him feel that he has
paid something.

School Broadcasting:

The program for high schools
consists of seven weekly broadcasts,
in Arabic, English literature, his-
tory, geography, science, news com-
ments and music. The same thing
is done for primary schools, includ-
ing travel programs, instead of Eng-
lish. There is another program
produced by the pupils and an-
other l‘or answering questions.
International (‘orrespondcncez

With a view toward promoting
internutioiuil understanding. young
people are encouraged to coin-
inunlcutc with the youth of other
countries through the exchange of
letters. The language masters are
in charge of this important activ-

cs

y.
Exhibitions:

Twice a year there are central
and local exhibitions for llll kinds
of work done by the pupils. Needle
work, knitting, leather \voi'k, paint-
ing, photographs and other things
are sold for the benefit of both tiic
students and the schools.

duced mcans after an investigation
of their cases by the school social
worker. in many cases rcliei is

PARDON, PLEASE

Through an error in last week's column, many
people have the idea that the English Department
has a new addition in one Dr. Townsend. In real-
ity, the gentleman is none other than Professor
Rich, the chief expounder of warted toad flavoring
for Macbethian broth. Our humble apoligies, O
Noble sire!

PUZZLELESS

The 00-01) seems to enjoy tormenting students in
a special way annually at about his time. The great
custom that has grown up of the New York Times
crossword puzzle, coffee and confusion in the cafe-
teria mornings has been made sterile for many by
the lack of New York Times. If you are among a
sufficiently affluent group to dole out the cash for
a semester's subscription, everything’s all right, but
the poorer group must go along without the benefit
of morning mental gymnastics. The ordering of five
or ten more extra papers may be difficult, but please,
Mrs. Sloane, take us from the horror of a puzzleiess
morning.

Speaking of gymnastics, is it true that Potter is
trying to develop Jungle Gyms on the apparatus con-
structed free of charge in their backyard?

TIME TO BE SERIOUS

We're not sure that commenting upon President
Collins' speech of last Friday is within our jurisdic-
tion, but popular opinion to the contrary, we’ll piod
ahead anyway. First of all, We were rather ashamed
at the large groups of empty seats on the floor. It
would seem to us that the upperclassmen. particu-
larly the Junior Class, would, out of respect, if for no
other reason, come to hear the speech. Those who
didn’t make it missed first of all a thought-provok-
ing speech and secondly, a fine example of what
previously had been a latent freshman spirit.

In our limited space, we’ll comment brief on the
speech and expect the latter point to manifest it-
self. Addressed primarily to the freshmen, the speech
has points which many of us who are in the final
year should heed well. Chief among these, we felt,
was the conception forwarded by Dr. Collins that the
college years are perhaps the only ones in which the
individual will be largely free from family influ-
ence, heavy economic strains and other factors which
would act as deterrents to unimpaired thinking.
With a little thought, one can see how vastly im-
portant this is. The college student is given four
years in which to question the views which he brought
to school with him, to examine concepts which were
unfamiliar to him in a freer light than before. and to
finally begin forming the philosophy which will in-
flence his following years. A good part of the fresh-
men will never entertain a thought that is more pro-
found than the deep student issue of how to look
attentive in class, or will the Yankees win the Series
in six? Many of the allegedly more alert upperclass-
men never have either, we can comment.

An opportunity lies before us all. An opportunity
to learn, to grow, and to become a better member of
society because of the opportunity. We hope, as
do President Collins and the rest of the faculty.
that the chance will not be wasted.

 

 

SATURDAY N IGIIT'S UNIFORM

In the past, there has been a great deal of con-
fusion about what the propcr attire should be for
the Activities Day dance which comes off Saturday
night. At Student Council Wednesday, it was de-
cided that this issue could be cleared up if standard
dress of jeans were worn. This makes for better
snake dances. Good work!

LOAN FUND

The American Association of University Womcii
has made available to the general student body a loan
fund of fifty dollars. This fund is open to any stu-
dent in need of the money and is being administered
by Mrs. Merlin Hathaway, llouse Director at Bru-
bacher.
