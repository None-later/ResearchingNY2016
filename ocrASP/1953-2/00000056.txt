On Middle East

Lecture Will Cover
Impressions From Trip

Dr. R. Rienow, Professor of So-
clal Studies, will speak to Forum
on October 8 at 3:00 pm. The topic
will be “The Middle East and the
Mediterranean.”

Dr. Rienow, after obtaining a
leave of absence from the college
in January ‘53, made an extensive
tour of Europe and the Middle East
in an effort to gather material on
international relations for his
forthcoming book. He and his wife
traveled extensively through Italy.
visiting such places as Genoa,
Florence. Pisa, Sicily, Naples and
Rome. From Italy they traveled
to Egypt, where they were partic-
ularly impressed with the strong
attitude of nationalism prevalent.

They also visited Beirut, Leba-
non, and Damascus. Visiting in
Sw1tzerland they experienced an en-
lightening stay at Berne, the cap-
itai, where Dr. Rienow conducted
an investigation of the Swiss gov-
ernment.

From here they traveled to
Strasbourg. France, where on March
12, a very critical session of the
Council of European Defense was
taking place in which a constitu-
tion was being adopted.

Dr. Rienow has written several
books. one of which. "Introduction
to Government," is being used here
at State. Among his other books
are "American Problems Today,"
and "New York State and Local
Government."

To the Editor:

Last year in the State College
News one article In particular was
devoted to the inefficiency of the
cheezieaders. This year, WAA has
formulated a new plan to get bet-
ter response and more spirit at

games.
At the present, there are two
squads, the Varsity consisting of

six members and the Junior Varsity
with seven members. Under the re-
yls'Cd plan the varsity squad will be
enlarged to a total of 9 members.
The junior varsity will be elim-
lnated.

But, for each junior varsity game,
three varsity cheerleaders will cheer
for that game, in addition to their
i'cgular varsity game. Therefore,
although there will be no junior
varsity squad as such. varsity cheer-
leaders will lead the cheers at jun-
ior varsity games.

The cheerleaders need new uni-
forms regardless. Therefore. if
State is; going to have a cheering
squad to promote spirit to back up
our teams, Student Association
imist approve an appropriation for
new uniforms.

This need does not stem from the
fact. that the squad is: being cn-
larged but of the condition of the
present uniforms. Upperclassmen
will remember that this matter was
discussed In last year‘s final as-

To the Editor:

We, a select group of freshmen
from Sayles, would like to have this
letter brought to the attention of
your illustrious sports writer, Ray
Wolfe, since it is our desire and
privilege to keep his paragraph con-
cerning us not unchallenged.

If that pint-sized columnist is
looking for trouble from the "un~
sociable," “unathletic” class that
will establish all-time precedence
for this campus starting October 3.
then we’ll give it to him! We’re
afraid that Ray has crossed the
bridge before he came to it. No
one can draw conclusions about a
new class of 450 students around
only a week—not even the King of
Troublemakers himself who has
been beating the young ladies in
ping pong at the Student Union.

We do hope for keen competition
in the rivalry coming up that
will long be remembered on State
campus.

Last week, while browsing around
looking for a little news, I hap-
pened to rim into Joe Stella. Since
Joe was president of the Varsity
Club last year, I thought he would
be a prime news source for the
coming year‘s activities. It was dis-
appointing iii more ways than one
when Joe as much .is said there
wasn't any Club and it didn‘t seem
possible that there would be one.

To bring some of you new sui-
dents up to date. the Varsity Club
consists of anyone hcrc at State
(Tollcgc who has earned a var i.,/
letter in our athletic program. It
was recently organized with ih.‘
aims of supporting and furthering
oiir athletic system here at State.
The number oi' men in the (‘luh at
any one time would probably not
exceed Fill and so it was looked
upon as a select group.

The members ran the conces-
sions at basketball games in the
wintertime. a business which we tin—
dcrstand can be quite profitable.
The members were even required
to pay does. which are still in the
treasury. (inc of the plans of the
