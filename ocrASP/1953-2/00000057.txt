cer game, half-time entertain-
ment, welcome to alumni, a pro-
posed cocktail party and dances
in the Union.

Promoters of the event will
be Iggy Komanowski and Jim
Bennett. Their units of can-
vassers will tackle the resident
bans for support.

vassers or who live off-campus

set up in the lower peristylc.
