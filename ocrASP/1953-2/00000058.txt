Dissipation . . .

The purpose of Men’s Athletic Associa-
tion, as stated in the Freshman Handbook,
is “to foster and develop athletics for all
men at the college.” Last Wednesday night,
MAA held an open forum to discuss just
how far short of this goal it was fall-
The situation that came to light was one
that reflected inefficiency, lack of coopera-
tion and absence of interest.

MAA, constitutionally, is set up similarly
to WAA. Every male enrolled at State is_a
member, and is entitled to participate in
MAA-sponsored intramurals. A few inter-
collegiate activities come under the MAA
budget, but its main purpose is to develop
athletics “at the college.” Then why this
lack of interest and participation? Why the
downhill slide while WAA has more par-
ticipants than it can provide equipment
for? The answers may be found Wednes-
day night at the Student Union when the
second open forum is held. It is at this
future meeting that the fate of intramurals
at State will be decided. Let’s look at the
issues:

It is reported that participation in MAA-
sponsored intramurals has been sharply
declining while the male enrollment at
State has considerably increased. This drop
is accredited to the uneven, often overbear-
ing competition between intramural teams.
The purpose of Varsity athletics may be to
win. The purpose of intramurals is to give
those who want it a chance to compete.
Participating teams are sponsored by fra-
ternities, dormitories, commuters, and other
independent groups. Since the power con-
sistently lies within the fraternity groups,
(titthers have been discouraged from compe-

1 ion.

The meeting Wednesday night is to de-
cide a new setup of intramurals which, it is
hoped, will result in more even competition
and a stimulated interest in MAA. Last
year, participation and organization were
so lax that not one award for intramural
athletics was given. There is a line in the
MAA budget 101‘ these awards; they are
based on interest and participation in a
variety of sports, much like the awards sys-
tem followed by WAA. MAA also has budget
provisions for individual athletic awards,
which also have rested unclaimed.

 

:3

There is a narrow choice in the course to
be decided upon to rescue intramurals. Ei-
ther MAA Will vote to continue its present
policy, a slipshod system that wastes money
and talent and does not approach the true
end of intramurals, or a new setup will be
plotted, designed for keener competition
with less emphasis on winning. The pro-
posed new plan would split up fraternity
power and redistribute the players on pure-
ly independent teams for the regular sea—
son’s play. At the end of the season, it has
been proposed to hold fraternity playoffs
With the awarding of the MAA trophies.

Again we face the problem of guiding the
hands that spend our money. Every male
member of Student Association is a paying
member of MAA. Every member of MAA
has the right of attending all its meetings,
and every member also has a vote at them.

By ARNOLD ELMAN

Throughout various schools, and
even more various years at these
schools, it seems that the depart-
ment most popular and the one
serving some of the highest goals
of American education is the cafe-
teria. There has been, for many
years, a gradual increase in the
occurrence of the Coffe-Klotch, as
well as an increase in the variety
of subjects duscussed during them.

How many teachers have express-
ed sincere regret at the illness of a
student only to ﬁnd him comfort-
ably curled around a table at the
coffee shop? How many teachers
have wondered why the coffee shop
had a greater drawing power than
did their classes? How many so-
ciologists have wracked their brains
feverishly, trying to discover the
secret of the why and the when of
the Coffee-Klotch? The answer is
ielatively simple. and has been rel-
atively little touched upon. prob~
ably due to its extreme simplicity.
The secret of the cafeteria lies in
its freedom; the freedom to come
and go as one pleases; the freedom
to speak or not to speak. as one
pleases; the freedom to laugh when
one wishes; the freedom to sit and
sulk. if one wishes :ln essence. free-
dom from the restrictions of the
four walls of the classroom. The
cafeteria does not just permit the
encountering of information of im-
mediate importance to the individ-
ual. It gives the individual many
other things, among them an ex-
pression, protection and strengthen-
ing of the belief in the Bill of
Rights.

True, there is a great deal of
trivia tossed around at the “Bull-
sessions," but isn't there a need
for trivia? The amount of pertin-
ent information floating about the
coffee shop outweighs by far the
amount of trivia. The coffee shop
is a clearing house of school infor-
mation; if you didn't read it in tile
papers. you heard about it at the
coffee shop; if you didn't hear of
it from your teachers. you got it
through the Coffee-Klotch “grape-
vine."

If one listens carefully. one real-
ims that a good deal of the con-
versations at the coffee shop con-
cerns problems related to. or close-
ly related to. academic work. There
are many cases of inter-student lis-
sistiiiicc. For example. I learned it
simple. home-made rule concerning
Spanish translation during a five-
minute glib-session at the local
"greasy-spoon." which helped me.
not only to more easily handle
Spanish. but to really enjoy it as
well. A corollary of the many cases
which are similar might be that
the coffee shop frequently demon-
strates grciitcr shoring powers than
the class room; one person is al-
weys willing to help another with
his work, when approached in the
right manner and when schedule

permits.

Paradoxicaliy, the student may
be more easily seen in the smoke-
dimmed environment of the coffee
shop than in the well—lit classroom.
Coffee seems to dissolve a great
part of the social veneer we wear.
In many schools. teachers make it
a point to have conferences with
students at the coffee shop in or-
der to build a greater rapport with
the students. By seeing the student
in all out-of-class situation. and
further le s s e ii i n g authoritative
stigma by physical removal from
the classroom, more satisfactory re-
suits are produced ili counseling
problems.

One of the American beliefs we
are brought up on is that of Amer-
ica as the great Melting Pot; at
the risk of trying your patience I
might suggest that the coffee pot
is the greatest ingredient of the
Melting Pot. Take any table at the
coffee shop; how many nationali-
ties? How many ideological differ-
ences? Chances are they range
from Mongolian. to German, to
sixth-generation American. and
from Nietschian to Christian. Con-
versation does not have the gener-
ally effete qualities of the formal
cocktail or tea party, nor is there
so great a preponderance of neur-
otic laughter and stilted toxic. Cof-
fee is the great collcgc solvent, the
universal mixer; and for all I know.
might well be one of the greatest
protectors of the American Ideal of
free speech.

JEOPARDY OF A JOURNALIST

With more than a little malice in his eye, reports
have it that Bill Small, the Sophomore Class Presi-
dent, is lokingr for one Ray Wolfe. You will remem-
ber that Ray threw into his column a couple weeks
ago the thought that the freshmen weren‘t very hot-
doggy. Since that time, the Red Devils have awakened
from their previous lethargy. Why there were even
twenty-five freshmen at one time in the Snack Bar
one night this week—a new record, according to
Wrinn. Rock, McManus and Kelley. the main-es
d'hotel of the lower regions of Brubacher. From
an unimpressive looking crew has emerged a prom~
ising class. . . . By such threads hang the into of
rivalry!

In another week. the big Campus Chest Campaign

doesn’t go flat. Remember, you have an obligation
for the uplifting of society.

MEAD CUPS

By this time. everyone has probably noted that iiic
cafeteria is using a new type of cup. in l‘iltilt‘l' wcird
colored plastic one. After experimentation. wv hui'c
found them to be more than satisfactory. One of
our heavy-eyed friends nearly burned his eye out
though when he tried to quaff some of Myrtlc's brew
too quickly in too light a cup. The Medical Offici-
quickly fixed him up by balidnging the third too on
his left foot. This remedy. used for aguc. burns. niid
leprosy. has been found to be most effective. Rc-
minds me of a story. . . .

A week later. we can all look
back on last Saturday. and say that
everyone seemed to have had a good
time, but as n finish for the day,
the Soph skit didn't live up to ex-
pecta tions.

The script was weak, but this
needn't have been a real handicap.
The worst fault seemed to lie iii
the cast itself. Lilies were slinky,
cues were slow. and perhaps worst
of all. the song lyrics were weak.
Even Ross Hack. who did a good
job. had to start over. He inan-
nged to make it funny, however,
which helped case what could have
been a bad spot.

There was a lack of tempo to the
whole show. which showed up lno
pun) in the over long piano intro,
and the opening by the chorus.
This last was a good number, but
seemed to us to be too long. The
rest of the show dragged because
everyone seemed to be trying to
think of what line came next.
Things picked up when Hack lnade
his entrance. but toward the end,
things seemed to go to pieces a1-
together.

Therc were some really funny bits,
as with the draft card and the two
frosh who sluiik in and ordered the
cokcs. but it wasn’t enough to save
the whole works. For all of the
ubch it was fun, and we want to
give special lllCililUll to the chorus.
They showed an interest iii what
was going on that we have seldom
5cm in u musical put on iii Page.
Let's hope that the next bunch can
do us well in this respect.

Next. Tuesday marks the opening
of the ‘53-'54 Season and we are
prunist a good bill by Nail Light-
holl and Jim Tlioliipson. Both pliin
urc conlcoics. we are told. and if
our scouts liiivcii'l' loused, it ought
to be 11 “real nice clam-bake.“ Are
you going to be there? Your money
helps to put. these plays on, why
not go and see what you are get-
ting for your money?

Speaking of 2\.D.. there will be
tryouts for the third set of plays
this next. wcck, Don Ducloo and

 

Arline Yanks are looking for people
who feel in an acting mood. Don’s
is a romantic comedy, and Arline's
will be a straight drama.

Gripe for the week: is there any-
one on the campus who would like
to donate a new casting bulletin
board? It has gotten to the point
where you have to push aside no-
tices that are months old in order
to find what you are looking for.
Alid until someone does see fit to
present us with a new board. how
about taking dowrr your old and
out-of-date sheets? It will give
someone else a clear space to put
up theirs.

It looks as if Dr. Pettit has done
it again. This year's ED. play is
to be the “Trojan Women." Remem-
bering last year’s “Everyman.” this
ought to be well worth seeing. Keep
the date open.
