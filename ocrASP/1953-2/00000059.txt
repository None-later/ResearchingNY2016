Vets To Meet,-
Discuss Plans

There will be a meeting of the
Veteran's Society on Wednesday at
12 noon, according to Robert Jen-
nings '56, Chairman of the Steer-
ing Committee for the Veteran's
Society.

A report from the Committee on
Faculty Advisement and the results
of their request for a bulletin
board will be heard at this meeting.
At a meeting last Tuesday night,
the Veterans discussed the need for
a meeting time convenient for
everyone. It was decided to con~
tinue having meetings at noon on
Wednesdays until a better time
could be arranged. As soon as a
majority of members are present
elections of officers will take place.

At this meeting the need for a
written constitution was debated.
The collection of dues was also dis-
cussed, since their proposed recre-
atlon, entertainment and work
projects will need financial back-
ing.

Well, I guess we have an ambi-
tious Junior Class this year. as
was seen by their first class meet-
ing. This energetic group decided
at this meeting that it was time
that we had a "big name" band
come to State for one of the more
prominent annual occasions. They
decided that the occasion would be
the Junior Prom and, as I learned
from their President, Bob Conn.
definite steps have been taken to
obtain such a band. John Orser,
class Vice-President, has written to
the American Music Corporation in
New York City requesting names
of bands which would be available
for the Junior Prom at a price in
the neighborhood of $1,200.

about 74a Sccfelcned
By BOB ASHFIELD

Last Wednesday night, an open
MAA Forum was held to discuss
and we think they termed it right-
ly, “the death of intramurals."
MAA includes all the men enrolled
at State College and fills the same
capacity as WAA does for the
women. The only difference is that
WAA is active.

It was surprising news to those
attending the forum that partic-
ipation in the men’s IM leagues
has dropped some 57 per cent since
1950. This decrease at the time
when the enrollment has steadily
increased seems incredible. What
then has happened to MAA and
its program?

To put it simply. 4 men can‘t
do the work for a group which in-
cludes 73‘! men. These »l men are
the officers of MAA and seem to be.
the only ones who know the
what's. where's and why‘s of the.
organization. As a result. intru—
murnls have reached :1 miserable
law.

There is not enough
among the men to set no teams
which will remain stable through-
out thc season, except. first is. for
the frat teams. which have their
prestige to uphold. ’l‘hc conse—
quence is that the »l frat teams are
the only ones hiliiling at the end
of the season for championship
honors. Vcry seldom have other
teams upset this theorem. Some
might ask what is wrong with
this. (fun it be helped if the fruits
have the best teams?

What is wrong is lllzll loo many
of the weokcr [cums concede vic-
tories to lhcsc top icions through
l'orfells because they i'igin'cd they
would lose anyway.

We like the suggcsiion of ini—
tiating a league or lcugucs wilh
teams of nearly equal ability (if
this were possible» and no Iro-
ternity teams to bc cuicrcd llS.\lli‘Il.
Each frat would have on oppor—
tunity to show its wow-s :II the

Rivalry needs defining. Most
important. Rivalry is not a hate
campaign; although some of us
seem to think so. Neither is
Rivalry lln excuse for the. Sophs
to ride roughshod over the
frosh.

()n the contrary. Rivalry is fl
method of organizing and unit-
ing the freshman class. It is
a win for the frosh to select
ihcir lenders and to unite. as
they did in last Saturday's
softball games, in a common
purpose. A! the same time, to
the Sophs, Rivalry is ii way to
coordinntc and strengthen their
class functions and government.

The thrills. hard work and

Rivalry Softball
Taken By Sophs

Despite the spirit displayed by
the horde of Red Devils of '57 last
Saturday, the Yellow Jackets of
‘56 showed their superiority on the
softball diamond as they triumphed
in both athletic events. The frosh
saved face in the fact that, due to
the quantity and quality of their
spirit, they captured one point for
rivalry cheering.

The women‘s game started in a
hclter—skcller fashion with the er-
rors being as numerous as the hits.
The frosh got off to an early lead.
but the Sophs soon caught and
passed them. The final inning pro—
vided a light finish to the loosely-
playcd game when the Red Devils
l.i(‘(l the score in the upper half
only to lose as the Sophs scored in
their half to win, 15-14.

Soph Defense Deciding Factor

The boys' game was a complete
contrast in that the Sophs‘ experi-
ence was the dcciding factor. The
steady pitching of Gerry Matti-
inorc, backed up by the impregna-
blc defense of '56, kept. the fresh
off balance throughout the entire
game. The buts of '56 pounded
uwny continuously at the slants of
the frosh luu'lcrs, Bernie 'l‘hcobold
llIl(I Ed Walsh, io make the score ii
resounding 9-1. The big blows were
four~busc wullops by Multimorcund

State SocCer Team

Boaters Trounce Plattsburg, 5-3,-

LOSC TO Queens

College By 3-1

Joe Garcia’s Varsity Soccer team will play its first
home game tomorrow afternoon at Beverwycx Park when
they tackle a tough Bridgeport eleven in an effort to bring
their season’s record over the .500 mark. The State hooters
have split two games so far this season, bowing to Queens
College in last Saturday’s opener, and edging Plattsburg
State Teachers College by 5-3 at Plattsburg.

In Wednesday’s tilt at Plattsburg, Garcia received two
pleasant surprises in the outstanding performances of Al
Lederman and Don Canonica, neither of whom were fig-
ured for starting berths at the beginning of the season.

Lederman, a freshman who

just came out for the team

last week, scored two big goals while Canonica, along with
the Lindberg brothers, sparked the team of defense.

W. Lindberg, Snyder Score

Other scoring in this game, which was, incidentally,
-ilbany’s seventh straight Victory over Piattsburg in soccer,
was accounted for by Bill Lindberg, who scored two goals

Statesmen Meet
To Discuss lM
L00p Problems

Considerable opinion on the con-
tinuation and improvement of the
intramural system at State was
voiced at a Wednesday night
MAA-sponsored open forum on
the subject. A goodly number of
students attended the meeting and,
although no definite resolutions
were adopted for remeding faults
in the intramural system, the group
achieved a successful analysis of
the system in respect to its aims
and faults.

lntramurais Lose Meaning

The intramural set-up has as its
purpose to provide a system of ath-
letics here at State in which every-
one may particlpate. In recent
years the number of students par-
ticipating in intramurals has dimin-
ished greatly and the program
turned from an enjoyable athletic
program to keen competition of
high calibre teams. Wednesday
night's meeting theorized that these
changes in the system were due
partly to the league participation
by fraternity teams, since the keen
competition is the result of the
fraternities' drive for prestige.

Proposals were suggested for set-
ting up a separate sports league
for fraternities, a fraternity cup
tournament or equalization of the
league divisions as a means of re-
turning the intramurals to former
standards.

M.A.A. Discusses Publicity

In a somewhat different vein the
M.A.A.-sponsorcd debate discussed
the need of publicity, and establish-
ment of a publicity committee for
the intramural system and the es-
tablishment of a trophy case for
the display of intramural league
trophies. In past years the pro-
gram has been deficient in public-
ity and trophies have been dis-
played separately in fraternity
houses and dormitories.

on penalty shots. and Don Sny-
der, who booted one through the
goal. For Plattsburg. Gotz ac-
counted for two goals, while Rouse
scored one.

The Albany team was not at top
strength for this tilt, since its star
defense men, halfback Joe Stella
and fullback Jack Hughes, were
sidelined with injuries sustained in
the contest at Queens. However,
the rest of the team took up the
slack as the forward line proceed-
ed to show that the best defense
is a good offense. Linemen Mar-
vin Luscier, Everett Welermuller,
Hank Hull, Don Snyder, and Co-
Captain Ben Button kept the pres-
sure off the State backfield by
spending most of the afternoon in
Plattsburg's territory.

Team Shapes Up

In this game at Plattsburg. the
Albany booters began to show signs
of living up to their fine pre—sea-
son form. They displayed good
teamwork and were free from much
of the pressure and tension which
were evident in their opening game
at Queens College of New York
last Saturday.

In this game the soccer squad
got off on the wrong foot as Queens
blasted across a goal early in the
first quarter and could not be head-
ed. The Queens eleven held this
sllm margin until the last quarter,
when they scored twice again to
make the final score 3-0.

State's offense was good in this
game, but the scoring punch was
not there. The main thorn in the
side of the State team was Pete
Meyer, Queens' ace halfback, who
repeatedly broke up potential scor-
ing threats set up by the Albany
offense. Joe Stella finally booted
one in for State in the last quar-
ter, but the point was nullified by
an off-side penalty.

Freshman goalie John Pengelly
played a good game, but could not
stop the polished Queens offensive.
He made ten saves in holding the
opposition to three goals. The two
Lindberg brothers, Bill and John.
and fullback Jack Hughes also
played good defensive games.
