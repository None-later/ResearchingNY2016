Blight Bites
Bending Elm

T l m b c r! The lumbcrjacks
have hit Draper. Those buzz-
ing. roaring noises that have
penetrated the Poly Sci and
German classes were not. caused
by a wrecking crew on the
school. The last old elm on
campus has come to ll. sad end.

The Ilutch Elm Blight that
has taken its toll in the park
and that deprived us oi‘ two
other clins a few years back
has done it again. This time it
is a serious offense.

That clm has stood over
State since its inccption 109
years ago. It numbers back
over 150 years. Not only is it it
landmark in Albany. hilt it is
the oldest clm in tlic lilistcrn
section of our country.

The squirrcls will have to find
u new place to nest: the birds
u ncw place to perch; and the
students a new place to congre-
gutc. What has become of
“Desire lindcr the Elms"?
