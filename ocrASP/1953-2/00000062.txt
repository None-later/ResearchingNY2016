Fellowships For

'Advanced Study
Scholarshi 3 To Include

Doctoral Ilowances

The American Association of Uni-
versity Women will offer twenty-
five fellowships for advanced study
or research. The fellowships will
range in value from $1,000 to $3,000.

All recipients who are studying
for their doctorate will receive two
thousand dollars. Twenty-five hun-
dred to three thousand dollars will
be given to more mature scholars
who need a year of uninterrupted
work to complete their projects.
The fellowships will be offered
without restrictions as to subject
or place of study.

The deadline for submitting ap-
plications is December 15, 1953. All
applications should be sent to the
Secretary of the Commission on
Fellowship Awards, American As-
sociation of University Women, 1634
I Street N.W., Washington 6, D. C.

These fellowships are part of a
fund of over $80,000 which the
American Association of University
Women distribute annually in the
form of various awards and loans
to graduate and undergraduate stu-
dents. Included in these awards
are sixteen awards of fellowships
to graduate women. State College
is one of the few teachers’ colleges
in the U. S. that is a member of
this organization.

Siena Players To
Dramatize Othello

The Siena College Student Sen-
ate Players. Inc. will present the
Shakespearean drama, "Othello,"
next Friday at 8 pin. in the audi-
torium of Philip Livingston Junior
igh School.

Tickets to this production are now
available in the State College (Jo-op,
according to Mrs. Eleanor Sloane,
Manager. General admission will be
$1.20; reserved loge, $1.80; and re-
served orchestra, $2.20.

The play, one of William Shakes-
peare's most famous, centers around
the tragic love of Othello, the Moor,
for the fragile Desdeinona.

An interesting sidelight is that
"Othello" is the Shakespearean
play to be read in English 3 this
semester. Students taking this course
should thus find the production
quite worthwhile.

SLS Is Still Undefeated,-

Summit, KB

SLS Nips Vets;
KB Edges Potter

A pair of sparkling upsets fea-
tured an exciting round of intra-
mural football play this week, as
two powerhouse elevens, both ruled
“invincible” in earlier sports col-
umns on this page, fell victim to
supposedly weaker teams. Also in
this week's IM League action, three
teams, that weren’t figured as
strong contenders, showed that the
so-called powerhouses can expect
some more rugged competition.

Both upsets came in Monday's
games, one in the Beverwyck
League and one in the Dorm Field
League. APA, regarded as the
team to beat in Dorm League ac-
tion, had to settle for a 6-6 tie with
a hustling aggregation from Suin-
mit House. The key play in this
game occurred when Summit re-
covered a fumble in the APA end
zone. Pete Diaferia, Stan Gutcn.
and little Jacky Klein turned in
stellar performances for Summit.
while Ed Rockstroh and Jim Ben-
nett paced Alpha Pi Alpha with
their bone-crushing line play.
Blattman Stars for KB

Monday. proving to be a big day
for the underdogs. also saw Potter
Club go down in defeat. The Pot-
ter House men, last year's cham-
pions, were stunned by the 13—8 de-
feat hande dthem by Kappa Beta.
The chief factor in the KB Will
was the superb passing of Abe
Blattman, plus some well-balanced
all-around line play. Twice Blatt-
man connected with touchdown
passes, one to Bob swim and one
to Marv Goldstein. EEP drew first
blood in the game, with Kenny
Stevenson accounting for two points
on a safety. A Potter threat was
stopped by the half-time whistle
with the ball resting on the KB
two-yard line. A Bob Sage-Herb
Egert pass completed Potter scor-
ing.

SLS, Mustangs Win

Tuesday's games were also thrill—
ers. as SLS nipped the Vets on Bev—
crwyck and the Mustangs squeezed
over Sayles Hall. iii-ti, on Dorm
Field. The SLS aggregation looked
potent in their battle with a hard-
cliiii'ging Vets team which could
have been the APA jiiyvecs. The
game's oiily scoring was accounted
for by Jerry Moiisso, whose fine
all-around playing was climaxcd
by a TD pass to Stan Howlett in
the end zone. Nobody looked good
for the Vets.

In Tuesday‘s other game. the
Mustangs edged the Snyles Bur-
giilns. 13-6. The passing combina—
tion of Ed Jones-Curvy Enficld
paced the Mustangs' scoring punch.
The Suyles tcuin sul'ici'cd ll rc-
versnl of form after last 'I‘hiirs-

STAT! COLLEGE NI‘WI. FRIDAY. mTQIER 16. 1933‘

 

4m ‘71:. sum

By BOB ASHFIELD

 

Last week‘s plea to statesmen to
attend the MAA discussion on
Wednesday night was answered by
a large number of men. The group
talked over the ideas of what is
wrong with MAA and what should
be done about it.

The ideas of forming new leagues
with or without fraternity teams
were let out for public opinion.
From what we gathered,most every-
one felt that frat teams deserve,
and should be in the leagues. for
reasons of interest anyway. If one
thing can be pinned down as being
the basic reason for all the con-
fusion, it seems to be the interest
of the individuals. Why don't the
men participate in IM sports more?

Men who like to play basketball.
football 01' softball won't quit just
because they lose. Teams with just
average players have come up with
good games against some of the
"powerhouses." Any team can be
upset—any underdog can rise up
and knock off a leader (even the
Dodgers beat the Yanks).

Intrainuriils are organized in sort
of a hop—hazard method. A list
is put up so that men who want
to enter a prospective team may
sign their names. This list is post-
ed on the MAA bulletin board for
a few days. At that time the names
on the list are the extent of the
league. It seems reasonable that
not enough men (especially frosh
and ll'llilSICI‘Sl see this or under-
stand what is going on and actually
miss out on entering a team. After
the league gets underway. anyone's
guess as to what team is on top
from day to day is good. Better
league organization is needed and
no one man can do all the work
which is required to make a league
function properly.

It seems quite incredible that the
soccci' tcinn keeps rolling along at
Sl‘t'll a rapid caliber of. home. while
their record on the road is just a
mediocre one. It sort of looks like
playing before the home fans means
something to the Lenin. Joe Garcia
kept his word last Saturday when
he said his squad would win if they
had the support of the students be-
hind them. Actually the ai't of
winning is not based on whether
there is ii muss turnout by the stu—
dent body. but the encouragement
llll(l enthusiasm of spectators have
llll‘ilill. the difference in the outcome
of inuny games. The Feds have
rolled up a string of 6 straight on
Bcvcrwyck. so let‘s keep the skeiii
intact by continuing to go to games.

Next Tuesday, October 20,State's
.l.\’. soccer team will scrimmage
Albany Academy at 3:30 on Bev-
crwyck Field.

Sioiesmen Meet
To Find Solution
For lnfromurals

The growing controversy on the
Men's Intramural Sports Program
at State loomed as the main item
of this week’s functions of the
Men‘s Athletic Association. This
year State has its largest male en-
rollment ever, yet the intramural
program continues on the down-
grade it has been traversing for the
past three years. The causes for
this, as determined by the MAA’s
recent efforts at solving the prob-
lem are many and rather vague.
As yet. a definite solution to the

MAA Discusses IM Problems

At this week's Wednesday night
meeting of MAA another at-
tempt at a solution was made by
means of first determining the sit-
uation and faults of intramuruals
at State. A large number of stu-
dents (every male student at State
is a member of MAA) attended
Wednesday's meeting. In c l u d e d
in the causes for failure of the
league. as determined by a forum
at the meeting, were: the league
set—tip which pits very powerful
teams against not so powerful
teams in the same league division,
lack of prestige for the intramural
program, lack of publicity and co-
ordination of the league due to
failure to post league standings and
game schedules.

A summary of proposals for reno-
vation of the league includes: the
establishment of different divisions
of league competition based upon
the teams‘ ability, the initiation of
a representative of each team to
report th eteam‘s game results and
statistics to league officials for the
publishing and recording of such,
the stiffening of forfeiture rules in
competition, the establishment of
harder entrance requirements for
teams joining the circuit and the
barring of fraternity teams from
loop play. with the establishment
of a specail league division for frat
teams. No definite remedies
were adopted for the situation and
ii committee composed of MAA
council members is to study the
situation and suggest definite steps
to be taken at the next meeting of
MAA.

Need of Publicity

Disciissloii on the work of thcsoon
to be organized groups for the pub-
licity and hospitality of the athlet-
ic functions of State. The public-
ity group is seriously needed to fo-
cus attention on the athletic ven-
tures of Stiite. The group's work
will iniiinly consist of preparing and
bundling copy on this subject to
be sent to lll‘Cil newspapers and
radio and TV stations. A large
sized group is vital for the efficient
fiinctlonings of the purpose of the
group. Anyone interested In help-
ing State's athletics either throuin
hospitality or publicity groups is
urged to sign up with Coach Hiith-
away as soon as possible.

Garciamen Edge
Bridgeport, 3-1

Joe Garcia's rough and ready
squad will take on the Geneseo and
Oswego State Teachers College, re-
spectively. on an out of town trip
this weekend. The statesmen, hit-t
ting their stride after downing th‘é
Bridgeport team at Beverwyck Field
this past Saturday, feel that they
are ready to uphold their position
on the field against the tough out
of town elevens.

Saturday's struggle against
Bridgeport proved to be as exciting
a game as we are likely to see in
any of the scheduled games this
year. For three quarters, both teams
struggled against each other, and
the game remained scoreless. A
sudden blast in the last quarter
with nine minutes left to play let
a goal by Bill Belmont of Bridge-
port raise the score to 1-0. The
next minute and a half were
fought so rapidly that most spec-
tators failed to see wha' hoppen’.

Rockiein, Snyder Score

In that rapid space of time, Al
“Rocky” Rocklein headed into the
Bridgeport goal, leaving their
goalie, Bill Slabkln. in utter con-
fusion. The next minute or so saw
Don Snyder. State’s Inside Left, put
in two rapid goals, bringing the
score up to 3-1. This brilliant come-
back by the Statesmen left our op-
ponents without cause. and neither
team scored again, leaving the final
score State 3. University of Bridge-
port 1.

Credit can be bestowed on fresh-
man “Sklp” Luscier and Joe Stella
for the able assists on our goals,
and to goalie John Pengelly for
many saves. holding the Bridgeport
team's score down.

Defense Outstanding

Also to be commended for out-
standing performances on the field
are: The Lindberg brothers. Bill and
John, whose dribbling kept the op-
ponents confused, and fullbacks
Jack Hughes and Ralph Adams,
both playing a tight defensive
game. Ben Button. Hank Hull. Ev
Weiermullcr. and Al Lederman also
saw action during the game. while
Carlos Lill'CS, Dan Katz, and Jack
White sparked the Bridgeport
eleven.

This weekend's struggles will be
fought without the aid of John Pen-
gelly, who injured his ankle during
Tuesday's practice session. says
Couch Garcia. This mishap may
well put Pengelly out of commission
for quite a few games this season.
Possible replacements are not known
at this time. but the outcome should
prove to be an interesting one.

There was ii good crowd cheering
the boys on, and the cheerleaders
were out on the field strutting their
stuff. The outcomes of the week-
end games should prove to be iii-
teresting. us the team goes out with
if .750 average.

sorlng this group. the purpose of
which Is to help make the stay of
visiting athletic groups enjoyable
while at State.
