The freshmen conducted a class
meeting last Wednesday, report
Madeleine Payne and Patricia Dean,
Class Guardians. At this noon
meeting, the frosh selected a Script
committee headed by John Wilcox
'57. This committee will choose a
script for Campus Day from those
handed in by the members of the
freshman class.

The class also discussed plans for
the girls’ soccer game and the boys’
football game which constitute the
Rivalry program for this week-
end. All freshmen were urged to
compose songs and lyrics for the
Rivalry Sing. All original work
should be handed to Shelia Lister

a class alma mater, with original
words and music, and a song to the
Sophomores, with original words,
are needed for the Sing.

stated that the names of nominees
would be posted on the class bulle-
tin board and that voting would
take place at the following class
meeting.

All frosh interested in working on

While thumbing through a mil-
lion musty manuscripts in the Ex-
change, we discovered but a few
flavorful gems.

From the Siena News: A profes-
sor is someone who talks in some-
one else’s sleep.

From the Buffalo Spectrum; 1)
Two Hipsters are making it back to
New York from Paris by ship. They
spot the Statue of Liberty and one
says to the other, “Man, dig that
crazy Ronson.”

2) A fraternity man stared at the
young fresh co-ed. “Tell me,” he
said, “are you the Chesterfield or
the Camel type?"

“Meaning what?” she asked.

“Do you satisfy—or do you walk
a mile?"

From the State Times. Oneonta.
N. Y.:
A gum chewing girl and a gum
chewing cow

Are the same, but different some-
ow,
Thinking it over, it seems to me

now,

It’s the intelligent look on the face

of the cow.

From Tempo, Chicago Teachers
College: An eighth grade English
lesson produced these bright ob-
servations:

1. An active verb ShOWS action, a

passive verb shows passion.

A metaphor is a think you shout

through.

3. The future of “I give" is “you
take."

. The feminine of bachelor is lady-
ln-waitlng.

5. The passive of “John shot my
dog" is “My dog shot John."
From the Minnesota Dally comes

proof that Shakespeare’s writings

can apply to almost anything. Here
are that talented gentleman’s views
on: Studying in the Library: “More
light, you knaves: and turn the
tables up, and quench the fire, the
room is grown too hot." Romeo and

Juliet. Crainming at 3 a.m.: “How

weary. stale. flat and unprofitable

seem to me all the uses of this

world.” Hamlet. Crammlng at 7

a.m.: “It is not for your health

thus to commit your weak condi-

tion to the raw, cold morning."

Julius Caesar.

From The Bucknellian: Lend an
ear, freshmen. These three com-
mandments, drawn up by the Uni-
versity of California might aid you
on the rough road to becoming a
"suave" upperclassman:

No high school paraphernalia will
be tolerated and thou shalt not

bluster ostentatiously about child-
hood achievements.

Thou shalt not pose as a “Big Man
On Campus."

Thou shalt learn that saddles.
levis and such do not consti-
tute the proper full dress and

should be worn only to brawls.

Going once. Dance Saturday To Terminate
Annual Campus Chest Collection

Going Twice...

Amid the coke bottles and
cigarette butts in the Commons,
a Chinese Myskania auctioned
conunoditles of varying import.
Miss Newbold was awarded to
APA as a waitress after the bid
soared to over $40, thus adding
to a growing Campus Chest.

Hoarse Myskle members
perched on convenient chairs
and tables to avoid the rush
as over-anxious pedagogues vied
for Miss Newbold, Mr. Wheeler
and an hour late permission for
a. campus damsel.

Tempers ran high, pockets
grew empty and bedlam mount-
ed as time came to close the
bidding. With the sounding of
a. hidden alarm some poor pod
was left holding the bid. The
spirit of friendly rivalry pre-
valled even as the few stretcher
cases were carried off to tin-
Itccovcry Room.
