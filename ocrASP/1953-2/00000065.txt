0m 0n 7!“: Hide

By FRITZ CRUMB

After last week’s News came out,
we had a few people ask us how
we wrote the review for the plays.
The tone of the question hinted
that we were trying to please all
who were in the plays and still
get in some dirty digs on the side.

We were not trying to please all
who were in the plays, nor were we
looking for things that we could
pick apart. A reviewer has little
enough reason for writing, but if
he can help the plays that are yet
to come by pointing out what to
him seem the faults as well as the
good points of past performances,
then to some extent he has justi-
fied the space he takes up every
week.

Watch for: Movie to be pre-
sented by D and A. It will be
something on the line of last year’s
Titan, featuring the work of artists
of the last fifty years; Dr. Pettlt’s
ED class play, which we are told
is going to be one of the best
things to hit State in many a year;

The Campus Day skits put on by
the tw0 underclasses. Both of the
scripts have the earmarks of good
shows.

The cut that stands on Front
Page this week is a sketch of
John Orser’s set that will frame
his offering this Tuesday evening.
It is a poetic fantasy. It will co-
feature with Dottie Mehan’s tale
of a man who longs for his home.

A bouquet to Don Duclos for do-
ing such a commendable job of
publicity for Dottie's play. We hear
he spent hours pasting yellow ric-
rac on poster paper with mucllage.

Any play that has a cast of more
than three is a headache to any
director. Just ask Arlene Yanks—
she's still trying to line up a chorus
for her play that comes off in two
weeks.

To all freshmen. and others in-
terested: Keep on trying out for
the AD plays. Even though you
don‘t make the first one you try
for, someone can use you.

Commuter's Club
To Give Prizes
At Annual Hop

Dance Features Prizes,
Halloween Decorations,

Cider And Doughnuts

Commuters and resident students
at State College are invited to turn
out in full regalia, as far as foot-
wear is concerned at least, for Com-
muters Club’s annual Soc-Hop to—
night. Raymond Distin and his or-
chestra will provide music for danc-
ing from 8:30 to 11 pm. The event
will take place in the gym in Page
Hall.

There will be plenty of excite-
ment as prizes are awarded to the
person with the flashiest socks and
to the people with the largest and
smallest feet, announces George
Wood ’54, President.

Cider and doughnuts will ‘be
served as refreshments, in keeping
with the Hallowe'en theme. This
idea will also be carried out by the
use of vivid Autumn decorations.

An admission price of sixty cents
will be charged. Tickets are on
sale now at the Commuters Club
desk in lower Husted and may be
purchased at the door tonight.

General chairman of the affair
is Kathryn Johnston '55. Other
committee heads include: orches-
tra, Mary McCann ‘55; refresh-
ments, Livingston Smith ‘56; tick-
ets, Benjamin Friedman '55; and
publicity. Elaine Swartout mid
Carol Saunders, Sophomores.

If this year‘s Soc—Hop is as well
attended as last year's was, Com-
muters Club can look forward to
another comfortable profit. Last
year ii large crowd clothed in jeans,
buggy shirts and flashy socks
danced around amid cornstalks and
pumpkins. The prize for the big—
gest feet lust year went to a girl
with well padded socks. Janc
Whitehurst ‘56 was named the girl
with the t'liishiest socks. All this
and more is promised for tonight.

To insure that the affair lives
up to its provocative title, fill com-
crs will be requested to check
their shoes at the door and spend
the rest of the evening in stocking
feet.

'Dig Thai
Soph Banner’

“S 01 id in a n, solid." The
Sophomore Banner was really
“solid” at the Banner Hunt
Saturday. one hundred and
fifty pounds of cement solid.

Through the valiant efforts
of Cassevoy, Elgie, King. Shu-
manski, Smith, and Small at
2:00 a.m., some days before,
the Soph banner was placed in
an abandoned oil can, some
feet below the Draper terrain.
Even it “Here it is" sign
couldn't aid and abet the Red
Devils to educe the “yellow
and white."

The Red Flame of '57 didn’t
burn bright enough to attract
the attention of a few eagle-
eyed fifty-sixcrs. Is it true
that Burns, Payne and (lo. cut
the banner in little pieces and
hum,r It on an adjoining tree?

With both banners nestling in
litte nooks about the city, the
hounds are out to get the
goods, not the facts.
