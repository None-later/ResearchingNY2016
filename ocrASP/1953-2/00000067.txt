While we par ‘Bver the papers
from other colleges We found
items that express a common senti-
ment. From Record, New York
College for Teachers at Buffalo:

“Hark the Lark"
What a beautiful dawn! What a
wonderful day!
With.the sun and the sky and the
‘ blue in it.
And oh, what a shame. on a morn-
ing like this.

 

That I have to get up and ruin it.
Also, this little gem: “Little Blue
Riding Hood" is the most to say
the least. Now when a girl gets up
in class and tries to bluff through
ananswer the prof comes up with
themonotone sentence, “All I want
are the facts. ma'm. . ."

We have no comments on the fol-
lowing, from Central Michigan Life,
Central Michigan College: Signs of
the Times: (In front of a school)
“Don’t kill a child." Then scrawled
underneath, “Wait for a teacher."

Prof: "Gentlemen. I am dismiss-
ing you if this room doesn't settle
down."

Voice from the back of the
room: “Go home and sleep it off,
old man."

And then there is the remark of
a freshman girl taken from the
“Roving Reporter" of The Ithacan,
Ithaca. College: “The frosIh beanies
are adorable, but annoying
and so are the boys." I

This may not be too applicable
at State, bllt we found it in the
Commerce Bulletin, New York Uni-
versity: “Football season is the only
time of the year when girls whistle
at men in sweaters." Robert Q.
Lewis.

Stop us if you've heard this one.
from The Bona Venture. St. Bon-
aventure University:

Knock, knock,

Who's there?

Oswald.

Oswald Who?

Oswald my gum.

. . . or this: Shen Lee. the new
Chinese whiskey, is now on the
market.

Now that you've had a few
laughs (we hopel. how about a lit-
tle thought on this one from The

Ithacan, Ithaca College:
Do You Just Belong?

Are you an active member.

The kind that would be missed,
Or are you just contented

That your name is on the list?
Do you attend the meetings

And mingle wtih the crowd.
Or do you stay at home

And crab both long and loud?
There is quite a program planned

That means success, if done,
And it can be accomplished

With the help of everyone.
So. attend the meetings regularly.

And help with hand and heart,
Don't be Just a member.

But take an active part.
Think this over. Member,

Are we right or are we wrong?
Are you all active member?

Or——Do you just belong?

llockcy l'layday Scheduled

Teachers, Blenlt
Union 2-0; Beet
New England 3-2

The Albany State soccer team
will play host tomorrow to a pow-
er-laden Long Island University
team. The action is slated to begin
at 2 o'clock on Beverwyck Field.
The men from down-state have
shown that they are not to be un-
derrated. Albany. however, displays
a remarkable record and are con-
fident they can come out of to-
morrow's contest with their sixth
victory in the books. The squad has
suffered only two setbacks thus far
this season and have proven to be
at their best when the pressure is
on.

Teachers Squelch Union 2-0

In last Thursday’s game at Bev-
erwyck Park. the Teachers came
through with their ﬁfth victory by
shutting out Union College, 2-0. The
only opportunity the Schenectady
hooters had to reach the Albany
goal was before the game. Albany's
defense was superb with all of
Coach Garcia’s men playing their
positions equally well.

Three periods of play found the
teams locked in a scoreless tie. It
was not until the closing minutes
of the final period that Albany was
able to penetrate the Union team’s
defense. Al "Rocky" Rocklein, a first
year man. broke through with the
game‘s ﬁrst score. The game would-
n't be complete until the Lindberg
brothers added to their personal
records and so John of the Swedish
soccer duo came through with Al-
bany's second goal.

After having scored their ﬁrst
shutout of the season the men from
ASTC took to the road Saturday
to clash with a highly regarded
New England team. When the ﬁnal
whistle was blown the score showed
Albany on top by the score of 3-2.
.1. Lindberg Scores Twice

Albany's leading scorer. John
Lindberg. came through again by
twice ﬁnding the opening clear in
New England's goal. It was the sev~
enth time this season that oppos-
ing goalies have found the blonde
liiiesman from Albany booting the
ball by them to score.

The score at halftime was 1-1.
Two quick goals by Lindberg and
Hank Hull pushed Albany ahead
and was all they needed for win
number ﬁve. New England’s other
goal came during the ﬁlial period
of play. but did not change the ﬁnal
results of the game.

The tally which ﬁnally proved to
be the winning one was booted in
by Hank Hull on a “one for the
books" play. The ball in play near
the New England goal was booted
toward the sidelines where it
bounced off the flag marking the
out of bounds area. The ball bound-
ed back into the ﬁeld of play. but
some thought that the ball was
dead and Hank. booting the ball
back toward the playing area, got
011 a perfect kick into the goal for
the tally.
