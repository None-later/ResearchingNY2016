Cut Committee

(cm from Page 1. Uolumn a)

The question of unexcused as-
sembly absences was brought up by
Mary Ann Johnpoll '55. Chairman
of the assembly seating committee.

Robert Betscha ‘56, suggested that
the students be allowed three un-
excused cuts per semester. Neil
Brown pointed out that one of Dean
Lanford's suggestions for the solu-
tion of the problem is to put the
offender's name on his Permanent
Record Card after his third cut in
the semester. Bill Small ’56 sug-
gested that the offender be sent a
warning after his third violation, to
notify him that thereafter all his
cuts will be placed on his record.
Student Council finally decided to
appoint a committee from Council
to meet with Dean Lanford.

Greeks Initiate,- Eight Social Studies Students

Attend United Nations Forum

By ANN TOBEY

State College has left its im-
print on the United Nations. Two
members of the seminar delega-
tion attending last week stepped
firmly on a gorgeous expanse of
cement, which, unfortunately, proved
to be wet. Thus did we say thanks
for a very valuable seminar!

Eight of us—Paul Saimond, Tom
Eldred, John Granito, Frank Shep-
ard, Bob Riegle, Bob Campo, Dick
Shaper and I—left Wednesday, Oc-
tober 21, for a Seminar on tthe
United Nations, sponsored by the
American Baptist Convention. Two
members of the Albany Council of
Churches of Christ drove and
chaperoned. The two car-loads fi-
nally met at the evening session
at the Carnegie Endowment Build-
ing, at which Godfrey Jansen spoke.

College Issues
Absence Rules

Although the College has no
formal cut system, students are ex-
pected to conform to certain set
regulations, announces Dr. Oscar E.
Lanford, Dean of the College.

The faculty members will report
all absences for freshmen. veter-
ans, students on probation, and
transfers during their first semes-
ter here. These students, when re-
ported, will be listed on the Stu-
dent Information Service bulletins,
and should report to the Student
Personnel Office.

Absences on the part of gradu-
ate students or undergraduates on
the Dean's List will not be re-
ported. Grads with a 2.5 average
for the preceding semester and
Dean's List students may cut
classes on the day before and the
day following a college recess.

Each faculty member will also re-
port absences which are, in his
opinion, excessive for those stu-
dents not in the above categories.

Mr. Jansen, Director of Public Re-
lations for the Indian Mission, in-
terpreted the role of much-maligned
India in the UN. He said India
feels an independent course of ac-
tion is the only right one and the
one which can best serve peace.

Friday morning (one of the few
times we all arrived on time) we
heard hom the U. S. formulates its
UN policy, and went on the regu-
lar guided tour of the buildings on
the Rockefeller Grant on the East
River. Everything is completed ex-
cept the landscaping—and cement
hardening!

After lunch, we again toured part
of the buildings, searching for the
meeting. Finally Chief Scout El-
dred located the lost lecture. This
lecture, on the Trusteeship Coun-
cil, was followed by time for shop-
ping in the Giftshop. We then
listened to special committee meet-
ings—one the situation in Tunisia,
or student exchange, for example.
In the committee I visited. a portly
delegate from Egypt was delivering
a lengthy dissertation on not much.
Listening in languages provided in
simultaneous translation at the
flick of the dial—English, French,
Spanish, Chinese or Russian—was
fascinating. We had dinner and
then listened to Vera Micheles
Deane, editor of the Foreign Pol-
icy Review, speak on American for-
eign policy. She emphasized the
development of the third force, be-
tween the Western Powers and the
Iron Curtain countries. We were
then free, after waiting for one of
our members whom the janitor
stranded between floors in the au-
tomatic elevator—with malice afore-
thought, he cut off the electricity.

Friday we went our various ways
—severai to the UN. others to lec-
tures. With a brief meeting for
summary the seminar was closed.

After fighting our way back
through dozens of traffic jams, we
flew up the West Side Highway
and back to our homework.
