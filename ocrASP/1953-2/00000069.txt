The Veterans Unite . . .

During the ast several weeks, a grou of
resourceful ve erans have taken the in tia-
tive in forming a new club on campus. They
have held regular meetings, drafted a con-
stitution, nominated candidates for the
election of officers and discussed their gen-
eral urpose and policy. Their next ste
was 0 seek financial support from S ..
When Student Council turned down. their

lea for funds from Student Assoc1ation

reasury, it was not because of any disap-

proval on the part of Council of the Vet-
eran’s Society’s program; it was because
the request was unconstitutional.

As it stands now, the organization of the
Society closely resembles that of a frater-
nity. Membershi is limited _to a small
segment of Stu ent Assomation, which
makes impotent any request‘for SA funds.
Membership in the society is open. to all
those students who have served in the
armed forces and have been discharged
with an discharge other than dishonor-

able. T ere is no specific requirement as .

to length of time in service. Any faculty
who meet this requirement are inv1ted to
be honorary members. Ex-serVicewomen
are also invited to join. At present the so-
ciety has thirty active members out of a
total school enrollment of ninety-seven vet-
erans.

The purpose of the organization is to help
veterans at State with their problems that
are peculiar to veterans, to keep members
informed of any news that applies to vet-
erans on reserve, and to aid fellow students
who are facing future military service. This
last point is not to be skimmed over. The
members of the society have offered to help

prospective defenders of the peace with any

questions they may have about service life.
It was suggested that open meetings of the
society would provide this opportunity to
disseminate unbiased facts from some of
those who have lived through military regi-
mentation. Every branch of the armed
forces is represented in the active member-
ship of the society. The straight scoop from
intelligent people who have lived through
what most statesmen will soon face should
be very valuable to Seniors especially.

Another purpose of the organization is
to serve as a social club for veterans. Social
events similar to fraternity functions have
been discussed at meetings. Student Coun-
cil has expressed a desire to aid the Vet-
eran’s Soc1ety in receiving recognition al-
though it cannot be chartered under the
Student Association budget because of the
specific limitations on membership. One
way the administration recognizes the ex-
istence of Student Association is through
such important bodies as the student-
faculty Academic Excellence Committee, in
which the students take part in planning
such things as probation penalties and our
new four-point system. Perhaps Student
Association could aid in recognizing the
Veteran’s Society by accepting veterans
willingly into the SA organications in which
they wish to participate.

I have heard a Teachers College
defined as a place where “imitation
pearls are cast before real swine."
I personally feel, though, that this
is a rather harsh view, and that it
especially does not apply to this
particular Teachers College.

However, there may be those who
do take this statement as the posi-
tive side of the controversy. If so.
the more power to them. There
can be no improvement in any sit-
uation if everyone assumes 21 Pan-
gloss, brain-washed attitude, or, on
the other hand, if everyone takes
the attitude that a situation is too
bad to be rectified.

IEdltor's Note.) This letter was re-
ceived by President Collins and forward-
ed to us by Dr. Paul B. Pettlt. Assistant
Professor of English. We think it war-
rants publication.

My dear Mr. Collins:

Knowledge and appreciation of
the United Nations was brilliantly
advanced by the voluntary contri-
bution of State College through
their First Year Dramatic Class un-
der Dr. Paul Pettit. Their presenta-
tion of “The Story of Interdepend-
ence" on Thursday last in Page
Hall revealed in fast moving se-
quence contributions in the fields
of public health, of Nutrition and
of Economic Rehabilitation, which
have earned for the United Na-
tions an undying appreciation
among the vast bust barely vocal
populations of undeveloped coun-
tries.

On behalf of the City of Albany
and also of the score of civic asso-
ciations united in the Mayor's
Committee for the Observance of
United Nations Week. we wish to
thank you for this significant con-
tribution to work, understanding
and friendship.

Very cordially yours,
Erastus Corning II,
Mayor of the City of
Albany.

To the Editor:

I got quite ll kick out of the lead
line in last week's News story about
the homecoming weekend. "To-
morrow an attempt to inaugurate
a new tradition at State will be
made."

It is my understanding that a
tradition is something that grows
from a. beginning in the dim and
distant past. This is the iirst time
I have ever seen a group winch
started out to "inaugurate ii. tra-
ditlon.”

The whole emphasis in this school
seems to be on having traditions,
not on what they mean. Perhaps Ii
iiitie thinking about this on the
part of the students would go ll
long way toward illuminating such
things as happened in assembly last
week.

Sincerely yours,
A Senior.

———-————

need improvement, and this must
be brought about by all of us. Since
I entered State four semesters ago
many improvements have been
made. These are evident in the
College Catalog and in the com-
parison of the number of gripes
published in State College News now
and then.

My gripe is not about the build-
ings, not about the curriculum, not
about the cafeteria, the library, or
smoke in the lounge. It is about
the general atmosphere prevalent
in the school.

Granted that Albany does not
have unlimited cultural advantages,
and that State does not have a
really adequate sports program.
But . . . students at State don't
seem to be willing to benefit to
the fullest from what is offered.

This doesn’t seem to me a sign
of apathy as much as it does an
indication that We don’t have our
purpose in being here fully in mind.
Supposedly we are here to get a
liberal education and to prepare to
transmit this gain to others. To
me a liberal education means, not
a log with Mark Hopkins on the
other end—that has long ceased to
be possible—, it means the acquir-
ing of an awareness of, and an
ability to understand and enjoy,
that which surrounds us. The end-
product of such education should
be a person capable of living in-
tensely, of getting the most out of
both physical and cultural pursuits,
in short an intellectual.

Here at State we don’t seem to
be developing this awareness. We
seem merely to choose up sides on
the intellectual-uthletic question,
and then reject any other point of
view.

Now why. tell me, can’t these two
groups get together and form a
student body that resembles the
ordinary conception of the student
body of a college? Why must we
sit around getting progressively
more narrow-minded and prejudiced
when we're actually hero to do just
the opposite of that?

Let's put a spirit in Minerva’s
temple to supplement the statue.

NOVEMBER NOTHINGS

One segment of the freshman class, the group or
men living at College Heights, has come up with a
mature approach to the yearly frosh election issue.
The election of the freshman class president has never
been too bright a spot in our political picture. With
the exception of the incubent Sophomore president,
the candidates for the office come to the House and
fade from the school picture. In an attempt to elim_
inate this, the boys from the Barracks wanted to have
the candidates for th eoffice come to the House and
present their views on different issues so that the
members would be better qualified to vote. Unfor-
tunately this idea was squelched by Election Ccm-
mission but we commend the boys just the same.

APOLOGY

Another happening relevant to freshmen we cannot
view with such a favorable eye. We are referring to
one of the apologies last week in assembly. Called
to the stage for th esecond time because of an in-
adequate first try, one of the apologizers launched
an attack of vituperation against the Sophomores
and seemed to forget what he was there for. Im-
maturity we can overlook in newcomers to the school;
we more or less expect it. What we cannot overlook
is a breach of good taste, particularly in the light
that this was the individual's second time around.
Thanks to Neil Brown, who showed his usual good
sense, a two-word attempt was made the third time
that was finally acceptable. How much easier it is
to go along with the college traditions as we find
them and not try immediately to change things about.
Suffice to say. the affair didn't reflect much credit
on the freshman class.

THE JOYS 0F COLLEGE LIFE

Brubacher seems to be having its share of coin-
plaints this year. From the residents, there have been
many complaints about the quality of the food. It
got so bad last Tuesday night that a few of the guys
from across the street were trying to find a spot for
a tote board in the dining room.

From the old residents there is the question of
what ever happened to the ten dollar room deposit
that was supposed to be returned when they moved
out. The people in charge seem to be quite lax about
the heavy task of putting names down on a list and
sending it to Mr. Gelbond.

From the general student body there are complaints
about the lack of work that the janitorial force is
domg. Wednesday saw the first cleaning of the down-
stairs lounge iii many a moon. We were getting tired
of seeing the same old initials etched in the dust on
the piano. This is supposed to be a place that we
can be proud of. The students are doing a poor
enough job making it that without anv additional
help from the paid staff. '

NOSTALGIA

We came away from Homecoming Weekend fcei-
ing very well. For the first time in the three years
that we've been in the college, there was felt a definite
school spirit. Starting with the fast and well-played
soccer game and ending with the very enjoyable
dance, it was a fine day’s entertainment. Congratu-
lations to Bob Conn and all his assistants for their
good work. It had great success for an initial venture
and holds great promise for the fixture. And Ismack!
smack!) we liked the punch, too.

CRUMMY COMMONS

With the coke machine back in good functioning
order. the Commons is assuming the look of an un~
cleaned sty again. We don't want to appear rcpcli-
tions, but we still can't understand why mature college
students wtll dirty a place in which they spend a good
part of their time. ‘

This anomaly is not the only one with college stu-
dents. We always chuckle when we think of Dr.
Bu'rs, "The college student is a very odd i‘Xi.Lll|)l('
of economics. He puts his dollar down and tries to
get the least for it."

Genius Jells;

The long-awaited super-pro-
duction of Marlowe’s Dr. Faus-
tus has taken over the spot
(January 12) formerly occu-
pied by the ED plays.

Our famous mad-cap direc-
tor, Zoltan Lennig, declares
ioyously that Faustus, begun in
September, will be the most re-
hearsed play ever put on at
State.

While Nijensky Lennig was
directing the ballet, Steinmetz
Lennig, who's doing the light-
ing, stepped into the spotlight!
After picking the glass out of
his foot, Arturo Lengivini raised
his baton and began the over-
ture, while Rembrant Lennlg
merrily painted on.

But Paul Bruce Lennig was
frustrated in his attempt to
build a revolving stage, by an
amazed and shaken Miss Flut-
terer.

Delayed, but undaunted, that
great director of stage, screen
and radio, has now decided to
present this epic on January 12.

Council Reinsfaies
lCA Delegation Line

At a special session of Student
Council Thursday noon, Council re-
versed its decision of the previous
evening not to send delegates to the
ICA Convention. At this meeting it
was brought out that perhaps the
earlier discussion was unfair.

Upon the motion of Frances Al-
len '54, it was voted to reconsider
the question, and the motion was
passed. 7 to 2. Council passed the
motion feeling that although the
conference may not be directly val-
uable to us, the attendance of our
delegates will maintain the prestige
of our college in the State Univer-
sity, and greatly benefit the other
schools who have less well develop-
ed student governments.

 

By FRITZ CRUMB

Due to a mix-up in the sched-
uling for Page Hall, this next week
will be the last set of plays for this
semester. (The why of this is else-
where in the paper.) But this last
bill ought to be good, for it makes
(or breaks) history in State College.
For the first time, we are going to
have the pleasure of seeing a mem-
ber of the faculty tread the boards.

Mr. Thorstensen will play the part
of Daniel Webster, in Arline Yanks’
offering this Tuesday night. We
have gone over the files and can
find no mention of this ever hap-
pening before.

Don Duelos will finish the eve-
ning with a romance about two of
the mest famous poets of the last
century. (And by the way, thanks

Art Faculties To
Exhibit Works

The second exhibit of art works
by members of art faculties of the
State University currently is be-
ing shown at the Teachers College
at Oswego. Previously, it has been
seen at the College for Teachers
at Buffalo and the Teachers Col-
lege at Geneseo.

In a catalog note, the commit-
tee on arrangements states: “No
single school of art or form of art
expression is dominant, and many
different materials are in evidence
in this exhibit." In another cata-
log note, President Carlson com-
ments: “This . . . is another in-
stance of how the diversified talents
which are in our facultes can be
united in common effort. It serves,
too, to show further ways in which
the parallel interests of our decen-
tralized campuses can be joined."

Future dates for the exhibit in-
clude Potsdam, December 1-14;
Plattsburgh, January 6-22: New
Paltz, February 1-14: Oneonta. Feb-
ruary 21-March 8: Albany, March
15-29; Cortland, May l-15.

‘ _— Release Agenda,

to the person who is lending Don
the dog for the play. Glad to see
that someone reads this space.)

The AD class, under Miss Fut-
terer. is trying something new this
year. With the dead spot in the
middle of the year (when there are
no plays to Work with) they have
worked out a series of lectures,
demonstrations in stage lighting,
make-up, design, and stagecraft
which they will present at some of
the local high schools.

Let’s hope that this project will
work out. State needs to get into
the Public Relations field With a
vengeance, and this looks like one
of the best ways we have heard of
so far to do it

Speaking of publicity, curtain call
for the person, or persons, who
thought up the eye-catching sign
in the Husted hallway.

And while we’re at it, we want
to thank all the people who have
done publicity for the AD class
and other shows this year.

Gripe for this week: is there any
way we could get the precenium
arch, and the masks in Page Hall
cleaned? We were sitting in the
hall the other night before the
plays and overheard some people
behind us (who were not from the
college) commenting on the dirt
and dust that have collected up
there for the last ten years. It
wouldn't take much to clean them,
and it would make the hall a lot
more attractive. Any volunteers for
an “A” ladder squad?
