PM 00! “o 3:04.”:

While poring this week, we ran
across some invaluable information
revealing ten easy ways to get
through college fromThe Missouri
Miner, Missouri School of Mines:
1. Bring the professor newspaper
clippings dealing with his subject—
any clippings will do, he thinks
everything deals with his subject.
2. Look alert. If you look at your
watch don’t stare at it unbelieving-
ly and shake it.
3. Nod frequently
“How true!"

4. Sit in front (only if you intend
to stay awake).

5. Laugh at his jokes. You can
tell. If he looks up from his notes
and smiles expectantiy, he has told
a joke.

6. Ask for outside reading.
read it-—-just ask for it.

7. If you sleep, arrange to be
awakened. If you remain after the
rest of the class is gone is creates
an unfavorable impression.

8. Be sure the book you read in
his class looks like a book from
the course (match books for size
and color).

9. Ask any question he can answer.
Avoid announcing that you have
found the answer in your little
brother's 2nd reader to a question
he couldn't answer.

10. Call attention to his writing.
Ed. If you follow these rules you
deserve to pass.

From The
New York:

I walked into the barbershop
The sign was somewhat queer;
“During alterations

We’ll shave you in the rear."

For our scientific observation of
the week, we submit this specimen,
from Ohio State Sundial:

From way down in my cranium
I this prediction make;
That if you eat uranium,
You'll get atomic ache.

Prattler, Brooklyn,

glorified appearance of a Poet's'

Corner, let us break the mood with
this “daffynition” from Hill Whis-
pers, State University of New York,
Agriculture and Home Economics,
Cobleskili, New York:

Bachelor—A guy who will consent
to get married if he can find a girl
who loves him as much as he does.

We thought the following, from
Bushwick Bulletin, was kind of
cute:

The bright student looked long
and thoughtfully at the examination
question which read:

“State the number of tons of coal
shipped out of the United States
in any given year."

Then his brow cleared and he
wrote: “l492—None."

From the Cavalier Daily: They
are studying the speed of light over
in Physics and have come to the
conclusion that it gets here too
early in the morning.

We wonder if this is statistically
proved or a slightly prejudiced
opinion from University of Dela-
ware's Review:

"When you address a group of
men. it goes in one ear and out
the other; but with women, it goes
in both ears and comes out the
mouth.

By THEODORE PEDERSEN

 

It can be generalized that all

people try to conduct their lives in
a way designed to obtain the max-
imum happiness for themselves.
From this point of view, life is lit-
erally “the pursuit of happiness.”
However, people differ in their con-
cept of happiness and this makes
for great diversities of ways of life
and callings.

There appears to be two distinct
concepts of hapiness among people.
The multitudes of the East believe
life on earth is cruel, evil, and full
of pain. Consequently, their con-
cept of happiness is in negating all
external reality, pain and care.
Once the Easterner has denied the
existence of all things external to

his mind, he finds a profound hap-
piness in the ensuing calm, serene,
and peaceful subjective state. This
subjective form of happiness, call-
ed “nirvana,” does not require an
external inﬂuence and is generated,
so to speak, within one’s self. The
jazz enthusiast who becomes “all
gone” while listening to a favorite
piece of jazz, is, at that time, ex-
periencing a degree of subjective
happiness. He has become oblivious
to everything except the music and
his existence.

The other concept of happiness
is prevalent in the West and its
basis lies in the external world, the
world outside of one's self. The av-
erage Westerner cannot long en-
dure solitude; he ﬁnds the pain of
boredom in that state and is for-
ever trying to escape it by exposing
himself to the influences of the
objective world. He is happy when
others honor him and have a good
opinion of him; he is happy when
he has a wealth of material things
to amuse himself; he is happy cre-
ating, in doing, especially in the
company of others with the same
outlook.

Since the mass of Easterners
have a subjective concept of happi-
ness and the bulk of Westerners
have an objective concept of hap-
piness, we may assume that their
concepts are not products of incli-
vidual thinking, but, rather, that
there are forces unifying the
thoughts of the respective people.
The greatest force is environment,
or the total inuuence of family.
friends, teachers, religion, and gov-
ernment upon the individual. It is
clear that an occidental baby rais-
ed in India may become 11 devout
Fakir; an Indian baby raised in
this country may bccomc ii captain
of iiidustry——such is the power of
environment.

The value of the subjective con-
cept of happiness is that it (loos
not require outside influences to
be enjoyed. Therefore, ii famil—
iiii'ity with this i'orm of happiness
will serve well when solitude is im-
posed and the delights oi" the ma-
terial world have been worn thin.
Here, then. is a hint to the answer
of the question why Western peo-
ple die quicker if they retire than
if they continue in their work.
Upon being retired, a large portion
of their objective world disappears
and boredom takes its place at a
time when they are least able to
cope with boredom. So they wither.
disillusioned, unhappy, into the ul-
tiinnte escape from boredom.

Just as in India, and other parts
of the East, we in this country
tend to follow an extreme course in

our concept of happiness. The
Easteriier cannot conceive. and
hence cannot enjoy. the pleasure

and joy of ownership. accomplish-
ment, fame, and honor. He cannot
appreciate the fundamental foun-
taiiis of happiness that exist. in thc
objcciivc world. Consequently, when

not in ii state of "nirvunn," he is
unhappy and finally dics having
experienced only ii part of what

life had to offer him. Further, his
philosophy is :1 dirch cause of his
short life span. In the United
States, it appears that the majority
of people put all their eggs in the
basket of objective happiness. Con-
scqucntly, they, too, ihinlly cxph‘e,
iii‘ti‘i' huviiig cnjoyod only one us—
pcrl. oi happiness, while another
gown o-begglng. This aspect would
have been iiicii's if they had broken
the chains of cnvironinciit ihiii,
bound them to their soiiiiii'y con-
cept.

2 Albany Boaters Seek Repeat
 Performance Over Plattsburg

 

Yictory Sl<ein At State Five Readies For Opener,-
Home Extended Release Schedule For Season

To Nine Straight

The Garciamen will be hosts this
weekend to the booters from Platts-
burg. It couzd very easily be the
seventh home victory for our team,
as they dropped the Up-staters 5-3
on their home field earlier this sea-
son. The starting line-up will be
the same as last week’s, with either
Guglielmo or Pengelly as starting
goalie.

Last Saturday, amidst the cries
of “Arriba” and “Let‘s .go, State,”
the Fed booters shut out Long Is-
land U. by a big 5-0 score. Home-
coming Weekend saw not only the
biggest crowd at a game as of yet
and the best show of school spirit
to date, but also one of the year's
best soccer games.

The statesmen kicked through
their insurance with three big tal-
lies in the first period and then
coasted along with some fine de-
fense. Their other two scores came
in the second and fourth periods.

Luscier, Lindberg Score

The first big point was put in
by "Skippy" Luscier as State took
over the offensive and scored with-
in the first five minutes of the
game. After some rough see-saw-
ing, Bill Lindberg was awarded a
free boot which he made good on a
fine fake-out of the MU goalie.
“Skippy” came through again late
in the period, giving the ball the
boot that counted after it had
caromed off both the goal post
and Rocklein's head.

In the second quarter the only
tally was made on another penalty
kick by Bill Lindbcrg. Otherwise.
aside from a beautiful corner kick
by Ralph Adams which just barely
missed the top corner of the goal,
it was a pretty hum-(irrm period.

Third Period Scoreless

With both teams getting pretty
tired, neither could manage to
score in the third quarter of the
tilt. John Pengelly. fully recov-
ered from a sprained leg which has
kept him out of the past few games,
took over the goalie position from
Tito Guglielmo who hid done ll
fine job in the first half. Johnny
made his come-back even bigger
by making 11 tremendous save on an
LIU penalty kick.

State Reserves Score

In the lust period, \.'iih almost
all of State's reserves in the game,
Rebel Hochmuth booted through his
first score of the year on a free
boot. Another grab by Pengelly in
the last minute oi" the game just
barely saved the shut-out for Al-
bany.

Some iinc wing play was dis-
played by Hank lluil illlCl “Skip”
Luscicr and Hughes and Ciiiionicii
us fulibiicks did a fine job of keep-
ing the bull out oi" Stll'C territory.
But for some fine hczidwork by the
Statesmcn, particularly on the port

of Johnny Liiidbei'g. the game
might have been :1 much closer
battle.

With the opening game of State's
1953-54 basketball season rapidly
approaching, Coach Merlin Hath-
away and Junior Varsity Coach
John McCormaek again last week
submitted their charges to a group
of rugged practice sessions. The
1953-54 edition of the Feds on the
hardwood will make its court debut
two weeks from Saturday, on No-
vember 21, when they oppose the
Engineers’ quintet of RPI at Troy.
Practice Nearing Final Weeks

With the initial outing so near
at hand, the team is now entering
its final stages of preparation. The
daily drills are now becoming more
intensified and the cage representa-~
tion of Albany is rapidly taking
shape. From indications thus far,
Albany has the making of a top-
flight five this season.

Last year State posted a twelve

How good are you at guessing

questions is in the affirmative
direction. then continue read-

Tomorrow afternoon the State

anything you name. it adds up
to a real exciting contest. But
to add a little more personal
interest to it, what do you think

final score is a mystery even
to Joe G.

if you have any ideas on the
outcome, just fill in the form

erans of last year's aggregation are
again to see action for State and
their performance, coupled with the
talent displayed by the freshman
and transfer members of the squad,
could easily be the formula for a
skein of victories by Albany State.

APA Victorious, 1
Summit Ties EEP
In IM Action

Winner 01 Potter,
Summit Clash Meets
APA For IM Title

There were only two clashes this
week in the realm of 1M football.
In the Beverwyck field APA took
the SLS gang for a loop. 13-7, and
on the lower dorm field Summit
House held the Mighty Potter
clique to a 0-0 tie.

APA Scores on Passes

APA was responsible for two
touchdowns, the second of which
was a controversial issue on a pass
from Ray Wolfe to Bob Dreher. ‘A
quick pass from Bob Strauber to
Jim Bennett raised the tally to 13
points for APA. SLS threatened
twice during the game, and made
good on a power-packed series of
downfield runs and passing by
Jerry Mousso. The TD play was
another pass from Mousso to Stan
Hewlett. end. Both teams played
equally well.

Potter-Summit in Deadlock

The Potter-Summit game was one
for the books. Summit played a
deceiving game, opposing Potter’s
equally strong defense. Both teams
looked good on defense, but serious
offense was sadly lacking. Either
the offensive passes were poor, or
the intended receiver failed to show
up on time. The breaks were
evenly distributed, though, and it
was the opinion of some of the
spectators that Summit was the
probable victor in the contest, with
Potter going off half-cocked for
an easy winner.

The game was called on account
of darkness with 5 minutes play
left in the last quarter.

The championship game, sched-
uled to be played off Thursday,
will in all likelihood be postponed
in anticipation of the final replay
of the Potter-Summit game.
