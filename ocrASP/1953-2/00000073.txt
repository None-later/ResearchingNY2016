Advisers To Release
Mid-term Grades

Mid-semester grades for freshmen
and transfer students will be in the
hands of all faculty advisers during
the week of November 16 to Novem-
ber 20, according to David Hartley,
Dean of Men. Every freshman and
transfer should check with his ad-
viser during that period in order
that he may receive his grades.

As soon as grades are transmitted
to advisers, notices will be posted on
the SIS list.

Students are urged to check the
Student Information Service lists
daily and report to the office indi-
cated on the list. The lists are post-
ed on bulletin boards in the Library,
Myskania bulletin board and in
front of the Dean's offices.

This service was initiated dur-
ing the latter part of last year, as
a result of the inefﬁciency and de-
lay of contacting students via Stu-
dent Mail.

Due to the growing amount of
enthusiasm in suport of the Pep
Band, the Music Department is
pinning for some schedule changes
to accommodate the band’s practice
sessions. According to Dr. Charles
Stokes, those students wishing to
participate in the band, ShOUld plan
their second semester schedules with
time for band practices in mind.

The schedule for practice sessions
next semester is as follows: Tues-
day from 3:35 to approximately 5:00
will be reserved for the regular
weekly orchestra practice. Thurs-
day from 3:35 to approximately 5:00
will be the new practice time for
the Pep Band. This change was
made possible because the second
weekly practice of the orchestra on
Thursdays has been cancelled for
second semester to enable the new
program.

The leadership of the band so far
has been in the hands of students

The performance date of “The
"Tragical History of Dr. Faustus"
has been changed to Monday eve-
ning, November 23, at 8:30 because
the chance to put the play on a
single bill. to have a permanent
set, and an involved lighting scheme
could not be missed.

Christopher Marlowe, who pre-
ceded Shakespeare, wrote his “mag-
num opus" in 1859, but so many
adaptations took place. that when
it was finally printed years later,
only a few superb portions re-
mained. I have attempted to re-
construct this play into a coherent
and dramatic form.

About Marlowe there is nothing
small or trivial. His verse is mighty;
his passion intense; his characters
titanic. To appreciate Marlowe’s
play and its performance we must
realize that he tried to vitallze
characted with one dominant and
tyrannous motive, that the dra-
matic situations are such that each
character is the epitome of varying
traits. His characters are not so
much human beings, with the com-
plexity of human attributes com-
bined in living personality, as types
of humanity. These superhuman

beings and Marlowe's mighty verse
require a style of acting. which in-
cludes an intensity of feeling, and
an essence of tragedy.

The play is a delineation of the
proud life and terrible death of a
man in revolt against the eternal
laws of his own nature and the
world. Logis. physics, law, theology.
each presents him with a haunting
doubt. What remains? Nothing
but the vast external void, which
his own doubts and questions fill
like fiends and phantoms. Power,
limitless as the mind, raising man
to godhood, is the lure to which
the soul of Faustus stoops. After
sending for Valdes, a professed ma-
gician, to aid him in calling on
Mephistopheles, the good and bad
angels enter, dramatically objectil'y-
ing the double impulses of appetite
and conscience, the one dissuading,
the other encouraging his resolution
to call on the devil. The drama is
given a great and tragic unity in
Faustus' protracted vactllation be-
tween right and wrong. After con-
juring, Mephisto appears and there
follows a scene which is great. not
only for its impressive dignity and
beauty. but also for the light it
casts on Marlowe's dramatic con-
ception of a knowledge-hungry soul,
gablng on the anguish of the
damned. and yet persisting in its
own blood, bequeathing his soul to
the devil for twenty-four years.

During those years he surieits
his sense of carnal pleasures. and
gluts his appetite for knowledgc.‘ He
forces the devil to answer questions
in astronomy and costnogrnphy, flies
in a chariot drawn by dragons round
about the world, and surveys the
kingdoms of the earth. Added to
the good and bad angels‘ voicing
of his conscience, an old man tells
Faustus there's room for repentance.
But the devil diverts Faustus‘ mind.
Plunging lnto forbidden bliss. again
Helen of Troy appears as ll crowning
pleasure, his thoughts: of repentance
forgotten.

The time approaches for his cud.
The last hour of Futistus‘ lil'c llll—
rolls itself slowly in onc powcrlul

A Perturbed Frosh

To the Editor:

At the student—faculty softball
game last Sunday I saw something
which threw me for a loss. I am
ieferring to the actions of many
of the students while our national
anthem was being played. It ap-
peared to me that litany were_of
the opinion that the players alone
should have stood at attention, or
at least stood still and kept quiet.
I don’t think that this showing of
disrespect was in good standing
with our aim to teach, which will
include stressing good citizenship.
Aside from this, the least we can
do is show that we are proud to
live in a country which is giving
us the opportunity to call ourselves
college students.

Dear Editor:

This is one freshman who cannot
see how the apology from one mem—
ber of the class can be said to re-
itcct on the entire class until the
reaction of the class is known.
Two weeks ago in assembly, when
an apology was made which was
considered inadequate. the class of
1957 made no sign of approbation
or censure: indeed, many of us (lid
not even know what had taken
place on the stage until it was
over—hence, no reaction.

However, last week in assembly
two members of the class apologized
in a manner which all approved—
we frosh included. and we expressed
our unequivocal sanction.

'l‘hcrcforc, I should like to suggest
that. until the general feeling in
the class of 1957 is made known re-
garding thc apology of two weeks
ago, it reflects on nothing more
than the speaker himself.

Sincerely yours,

4400;7110 8W Cheering Squad

By BOB ASHFIELD

Last Monday night saw the fi-
nale of this year’s IM football
when the APA men added the foot-
ball championship to their laurels.
It was not an especially exciting
season, but some of the top teams
did get upset to make matters in-
terestlng.

Football is really a great game,
both from a player’s viewpoint from
a fan's, as is verified by the great
following of the teams around the
nation today. One of the best fea-
tures of the game is displayed when
a squad can activate both a run-

ning and an aerial attack to their
own advantage.

After having watched some of
the IM games this year, we have
noticed the lack of a real running
game. Except in few instances,
most of the ground gaining was
accomplished via the an. Natural-
ly, in touch football, a back has
to have awfully good interference
on a downfield run to get any-
where before being downed by a
two-hand “touch.” Therefore, most
teams don‘t have any alternative,
but to pass the ball.

We would like to think that a
better running game and a more
interesting one to watch could be
made possible if six-man teams
were again the limit. With six
less men on the field, it would stand
to reason that the game would be
more open and allow for those play-
ers with the “know-how" to cap-
italize on their speed and decep-
tion. The emphasis would again
be on football as a skill not as a
game in which the only aim now
seems to be to knock the other guy
down. A more open style of game
would allow for higher scoring
games and (Io-emphasize the line-
play which is so important in the
tpe of game we have now.

Since MAA is supposed to be in
the stages of reformation now, why
not toss in the towel on nine-man
football and reactivate the six—man
teams?

Actually operating nine—man
teams in the IM League was sup-
posed to bring us closer to that far-
l'etched goal of varsity football at
State, but in three years nothing
has been realized, so why ruin lM
football in the meantime?

Policy of the week—not crouch
and cover, but dig a hole and hide.

Monday afternoon saw the re-
turn of the IM football cup to the
APA house for the first time in
five years as the APA's shut out the
Potter boys, 12-0, on Beverwyck
Field.

Derwln Scores Twice

Both teams played top ball, but
a deficit of two touchdowns at the
end of the first quarter sort of dis-
heartened the boys from State St.
The two tallies were both picked
up on Strauber to Derwin passes
into the end zone. Both were also
the result of Potter fumbles near
their own goal line.

The rest of the contest remained
scoreless as the Potter aggregation
tightened up their game with some
good defense by Stevenson, Victor,
Barbash, McKay. and Krchniak.
Their main lack was a good pass
defense and enough reserves to give
the offensive team some time to
rest.

EEP Lacks Offense

The EEP men also couldn't seem
to get their offense started, as they
picked up only one first down in
the whole game. This was on a
long pass from quarterback John
Morrissey to Sam Krchniak. Could
be that John really did need some
suds and a seegar. In any case.
he didn‘t have too good an after—
noon. From the sidelines it looked
as though a little less passing and
few more ground plays might
lave been the clue to put the boys
in the scoring column. Three pass
interceptions by Dick Stanford
didn't help their fight any, either.

fine line defense for the Apes by
Jim Bennett, Joe Patrick, Gene

defense by Flash Fox, Bobby Dreher,
and Chuck Derwin, were enough to
keep the Club well out of scoring
territory. A fine job was also done
on offenSe by John Lucas at guard
and Will Monsell holding down the
center slot.

Rumor has it that quarterback
Morrissey played the last three
quarters with a rather sore arm
due to someone's pugnacity, but,
aside from this, a few bloody lips,
and some raised fists. the whole af-
fair was pretty tame. It seemed,

Cogers Display
Superb Records

As the basketball opener comes
fast into view, much can be seen
of what is to be expected by review-
ing the players' high school records.
These records indicate many of the
hoopstcrs are quite versatile ln oth-
er sports as well as having a good
deal of basketball experience.

Records from Falcover Central
show Bob Sage to have played three
years of high school football, four
years of baseball and two years of
basketball. Bob has added two more
years of basketball and baseball
here at College.

Gerry McDonald. who hails from
Chatcaugay High, has had four
years of high school experience.
Gerry's name was also found in
baseball box-scores for four seasons
at Chateuugay. Gerry has since
added two more years of basket-
ball at State.

Draper High fans well remember
Nels LaRoc, who performed on the
court for three seasons. The base-
ball lllld soccer rosters of Draper
also listed Nel's name for two sea-
eons

Also starting the last of four
seasons for Coach Hathaway's cag-
crs will be John Zongrone, of Ches-

At the end of each basketball sea—

they will be out to capture victory

of the present campaign.

The junior statesmen will re-
turn to action Saturday as they
travel to Middletown. They will
be out to take this game in order
to even up their season's record. In
their other outing they were beaten
by the RPI juniors.

State Employ New Offense

In their game last Saturday. the
Gurciamen seemed to catch Platts-
burg completely off balance at the
outset, and never gave them time
to recover. Plattsburg fought back
gamely, only to come out on the
bottom of a 5-2 score. Employing
a new offensive system which made
for an all-out surge at the oppo-
nent's goal, State had the ball in
Plattsburg territory for the major-
ity of the game. The system em-
ployed the use of three fullbacks
while the two halfbacks, as well as
the forward line, moved the ball.

The sound of the whistle had
barely ended when State started
pounding away at the losers' goal.
Ralph Adams came through on ii
well executed kick to put State out
in front with about one minute
gone. Following this goal, State
stole the ball and before the three-
minutc mark Al Rocklein had boot-
ed ln State's second goal. After
this jolt. Plattsburg seemed to set-
tle down and start playing a little
ball themselves.

Before the end of the quarter,
they had scored to tighten the score
to 2-1. The muddy condition of the
field made it impossible to get a
real fast pattern moving. so the
teams battled evenly to half-time.
Snyder, Lindberg's Score

With the opening of the second
half. Plattsburg immediately tied
the Score, only to have State come
back with three more goals. These
were recorded by Don Snyder and
one apiece for the Llndbcrg
brothers.

Just before the end of the quar-
tcr State scored on a disputed play.
when John Lindberg stole the ball
from the Pluttsburg goalie and
booted one into the unguarded net.
This play brought about an thll-
lanchc of arguing which ended with
the play being ruled legal.

Much credit should be given to
the State goalie, John Pengelly, for
his outstanding play despite the
sloppy condition of the ground in
and around the goals. This marked
his first full game since returning
to the llneiip followlng his injury.
