A Fight Song

Aspiring composers get out
the heaters and mix up a ﬁery
fight song. Take a few bars of
music; add eight lines of lyric;
and mix with an abundance of
school spirit, until the batter
has bounce and rhythm.

Bake the rhythmic cake be-
fore December 16 and send the
peppy popovcr to Mad Meier '54
via Student Mail.

The present battle-worn song
may find itself in the dusty files
if a powerful pep tune can tic-
kle the tonsils of the discerning
gourmets. Members of the four
classes will taste all entries and
award the blue ribbon to one or
more of the pastries presented.

less composers may submit their

may be a careful blending of
several ideas. (‘omc on State and

sible. papers must be ﬁlled in and
returned before the end of the se-
mester. according to Elmer C. Mat-
thews. Director of Teacher Place-
ment Bureau.

ter for second semester. To avoid

somewhat altered. the print is eas-
ier to read. and the booklet a bit
larger. according to Miss Rooney.
’I‘hc late appearance of this year’s
issue is due to difficulties in com—

SUB Sponsors Dance
In Union After Game

The 1953-54 edition of the Albany
State College hoop aggregation to-
night will make its home court de-
but in a clash with the strong Wil-
llmantic College five at the Page
Hall Gym. And as is the custom,
a post-game dance sponsored by
the Student Union Board will be
held in the Brubacher game room
from 10 pm. to 12 pm. The pre-
liminary contest pitting the Albany
State Junior Varsity against the
“GE. Generals" is to get under
way at 7 p.m.. while the main game
will begin at 9 pm.

A capacity crowd is expected to
be on hand to watch the States-
mcn as they get their home cam-
paign under way. With indications
prevailing that the Feds will be
displaying the high grade ball play-
ing that they are capable of. this
evening's tilt can be expected to be
a thriller.

The State cagers opened their
regular season last week with a de-
feat at the hands of the RPI squad.
In their first appearance the Feds
displayed much possibility, yet their
initial showing was not of the cal-
ibre expected of them. The Hath-
awaymen were heavily favored in
last week‘s game. yet suffered their
twenty-point drubbing due to poor
rebounding. failure to perform well
under pressure and a lack of large
court skill. With consideration to
the factors of playing on a large
floor and in the opening game. last
ivcek's fray cannot be considered
an indication of State's perform-
ance this season.

Last season State twice defeated
the Connecticut hoopers. eking out
a two-point win at Willimantic
and turning them back by a five-
point margin in an overtime squeak-
cr at Albany. Reports on the play
of the opponents are sparse, but it
is known that most of last year's
sound will be returning. asserting
the forecast of a tight contest. In
their previous meetings. Willlmau-
tic displayed a unique style of play
featuring a deadly outside attack.

During the week, Coach Hatha-
uway has striven to remedy his
charges’ backboard strength defi-
ciency. as well as to correct errors
which showed up in their outing.

Injuries as well as some fine de-
velopment of talent showed up in
the wock's practice session. John
