IF Fiction Contest
To Award Cash

For Predictions

What will life in America be like
a hundred years from now? That is
the theme of a new collegiate ﬁc-
tion contest, and a national science
magazine is paying $2,000 for the
answers. With submissions limited
exclusively to undergraduates in the
United States and Canada, students
will present their prophesies in the
form of a ten thousand word nov-
elette.

Ideas, imagination and plausibil-
ity will count more than actual
writing skill. Professional writers
attending college will not be eligible
to enter.

First prize is $1,000 in cash, with
six runners up receiving an addi-
tional $1,000 in prizes. Students
submitting manuscripts must have
them in the mail before midnight,
May 15, 1954. Winners will be an-
nounced nationally the ﬁrst week
in September.

The objective is to stimulate in-
terest in science ﬁction among
young men and women.

IF Magazine is sponsoring the
contest. If students wish to acquaint
themselves with the stories in IF,
they may consult a copy in the 10-
cal libraries. If a copy isn‘t avail-
able, they may send a post card to
IF Magazine, Kingston, New York,
and a sample copy will be sent to
them without charge.

For further information, interest-
ed students should write to College
Science Fiction Contest, IF Maga-
zine, Kingston, New York.

    

 

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. DECEMBER 4. 1953

0m 0n ‘7!“ 14%

By FRITZ CRUM

_—————--

A week ago Monday night, Art
Lennig presented to State College
his production of Marlowe’s Faustus.
It was a colorful show, and it had
moments when it wasclose to be-
ing great. But the play as we saw
it lacked something.

It may have been the script
which was adapted from the orig-
inal by Art. In this adaptation
we saw none of the comedy which
scholars claim Marlowe did not
write, and were left with what
amounted to a monologue by Faus-
tus with some other dialogue by
other incidental characters. While
the figure of the Devil was always
present, even he didn’t have too
much to say, compared with the
length of the main character’s part.
This, perhaps, was what kept the
play from being as good as it should
have been.

Even while the acting in the main
part was good, once Ross Newman
got into the role. it was not enough
to keep us from having a feeling
of monotony. Over and over, in
words that had a slight variation,
we got the story of a man, who
hungry for knowledge, sold himself
to the Devil to gain the end he
wanted. We got repeated two or
three times the fact that he want-
ed to repent and couldn't. In
short, we got too much of the same
thing in the first part of the play.

In the second half, there was

more variety, more things happened,
more people came and went on the
stage, and for the first time we
had action in the theatre sense of
the word.

The story went forward.

Your money is low,

PI-Io-os.

There the script came to life and
built to the tremendous climax
which, from the way the house re-
acted, must have had an effect.

As a first attempt at adapting a
classic to fit the requirements of
an AD Play, Art came off much
better in the second half of the
script than in the first.

As we said above, Ross seemed
to haVe a hard time in the first
half making the character of Faus-
tus come out. But when in the sec-
ond part Faustus was an old man,
he found the right pitch and
turned in a very good job. He was
well aided in this by the good
makeup, well done by Don Duclos.

As the Devil, Ruben Garcia
brought to the stage a grace of
movement seldom seen in this
school. With the exception of a
peculiar pointing gesture, all his
movements seemed to symbolize the
sinuous evil of the under world.
All in all, his work showed good
study and understanding of the
part.

The minor characters were well
done by people who for the most
part had never been on the stage
before. They seemed a bit tense
when compared with the ease of
Newman and Garcia.

To the Editor:
Hello Girls:

This is just ii note to thank you
for sending me the State College
News again this year. I would have
been up to the College but have not
had the opportunity to do. The
News has really been a treat and
provided me with lots of enjoyable
reading.

I understand you people started
out in a pretty state of affairs when
your Editor-in-Chief failed to re-
turn to school in September, you
have weathered the storm wonder-
fully and each edition of the paper
seems to be a little better than the
previous one. The make-up, variety,
and content of each issue certain-
ly is a. credit to you and the staff
and you can be justiﬁably proud of
the hard work expended in putting
our paper out each week.

Thanks and congratulations again
on a job well done, keep up the
good work.

Sincerely yours,
Don Burns ’52

By BOB ASHFIELD

Before we get too far entrenched
in the present basketball season,
we would like to take the time to
congratulate Joe Garcia, his assist-
ants and the team on the fine per-
formance that they turned in this
season. As a result, we State fans
can boast of having one of the best
soccer teams in the East.

Each year Joe loses men that the
team doesn’t seem to be able to get
along without, but then from out
of nowhere comes unbelievable tal-
ent to boost the team to greater
heights. Not only has the team
bettered its record each season since
being in existence, but it has ac-
complished this against stronger
opposition each year.

Soccer has wormed its way into
the interests of many State College
students as is verified by the splen-
did turnout at the home games.
The squad has retaliated by rolling
up 10 straight victories on Bever-
wyck, good for better than a two-
year span. An early warning to
other soccer teams for next year
would be to watch out for Joe Gar-
cia's squad because they are just
about tops.

Tonight Coach Hathaway's
charges will open the home half of
the schedule in the Page bandbox.
Williinantic, loser of 2 tight ones
last year, should put the States-
men to the test of just how good
they are.

The RPI skirmish again proved
that we will never have a great
team as long as we don‘t have an
adequate court on which to work.
Another thing which was evident
from the game is that State is
sorely in need of that one good
big man. It is our opinion that
the squad will miss more than once
during the season the services of
last year‘s captain, Bob Tabor, who
was lost through graduation.

1n adding up individual poten-
tial each season, it seems that our
team is about the best in the cir-
cuit. Again this season, we can say
the same thing and, if the individ-
ual potential can be molded into
team potential, we can and will
have a good team.

The i‘rosh elections to determine
their representative to the MAA
Council were held before vocation
and the results show that Cliff
Davis is the new representative.

From

 

To 1M Program

Coach Garcia has announced the
plans of the wrestling club for the
coming mat season by outlining an
extensive intramural program. Plans
call for a training period running
through the 4th of January and
culmimiting in a tournament.

There will be ten weight divisions
and the matches will start on Jan-
uary 11th. Tentative plans call for
the winners of the tourney to meet
the veterans of last year's wrestling
club. Coach Garcia emphasized
that experience was not necessary
to engage in the tourney. This
program has been initiated for any
who are interested in wrestling and
to build interest in the wrestling
club. The ultimate goal is to have
the mat sport as n varsity sport.

Veterans Form Nucleus

There are a number of returnees
from lost your, among whom are
Bob Drchcr. Ray Wolfe, Frank
Prindle und two men who took sec-
ond places in their divisions at the
Adirondack A.A.U. tournament in

Scoring Honors

With the soccer season well over
there are still a few facts and fig-
ures to be mentioned to show what
a fine season the ’53 statesmen had
this year. At the end of a ten-
game season they were on top of
an 8-2 won-lost record, giving them
an .800 winning percentage. Their
only two losses were in the opener
down at Queens College, a 3-0 shut-
out, and a tough 4-3 overtime loss
in their third tilt at Oswego.

Season Win Record

The other eight games were
scored as follows:

Opponent State Opp.
U. of Bridgeport 3 l
Geneseo 2 1
Plattsburg 5 3
Union 2 0
New England College 3 2
Long Island University 3 2
Plattsburg 2
Panzer College 2 I

In the total team scoring the
Fed booters racked up 30 points
while allowing their opponents only
17 tallies.

Lindbergs Lead Scoring Parade

The individual scoring was led
by John and Bill Lindberg. each of
the brothers with 7 big scoring
boots. This fact, along with his
fine defensive play and tremendous
pioymaking ability, was enough to
win for Johnny the team's Most
Valuable Player award. Bill, along
with Don Canonica, was elected
one of the co-captains of next year's
soccer team.

The rest of the scoring was done
by eight men as follows:

Player Pts.
Al Roekleln
Don Snyder
Hank llull
Skip Luscler
Al Lederman
Ralph Adams
Bill Bonesteel
Rebel llochmuth

r-Hi—Ntoroamc-

Tops on the defensive side were
Don Canonica and Jack Hughes in
the fullback slots, both of whom
improved tremendously over their
performances of last year. Very
probable to make the All-State
soccer team, along with the Lind-
berg brothers, is John Pengelly who,
in the goalie spot. did a fine job of
keeping down the opposition's scor-
ing.

Willi only 4 or 5 members of this
year's team graduating. it looks like
next year could be another big one
for the State booters.
