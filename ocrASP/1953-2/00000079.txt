We didn't have to do much por-
ing this week before we found
something that we are sure will
be of interest to state students.
Hereit is, in toto, from the Uni-
versity Daily Kansan:

There is a tendency at the Uni-
versity for twa students to fall in
love with each other, and since
one of these may be a girl and the
other a boy, it sometimes happens
that they decide to get married.
Recognizing this situation, Kansas
experts on love and marriage have
prepared a quiz to show if two
people are really in love, believing
that emotion is an essential to a
happy marriage.

Here are the questions:

1. Do you sit together at movies?
If you don’t. it may be that you
are drifting apart. On the other
hand, the theater may be crowded.
2. Do you go out as often as
seven nights a week? If you do,
it's possible that you're in love. It’s
also‘ possible that you're going
steady.

With the Winterlude this coming
Saturday, I thought it might be in-
teresting to find out something
abount the name band which is
playing for it. The band is, of
course, Sy Oliver’s, and By himself
has been kicking around the big
name field for the past decade.
So without further ado I'll give
you some of the information I dug
up about Mr. Oliver and after read-
ing it, see if you don’t agree with
me that we’ve hired us quite a guy
(and his band) for our Christmas
formal.

Biography
Sy Oliver was born in Zanes-
ville, Ohio—

While still a youngster, his Dad
gave him a trumpet and started to
teach Sy the rudiments of music
and trumpet playing.

it's not sanitary.

#
musical director and resumed ac-
tivities with his own band.

are included: Frank Sinatra, Bing

Mr. Oliver has also arranged

lywood. Some of the motion pic-
tures he has done arrangements
for include: “DuBarry Was A Lady,"

However, imitate the

master—

The wonderful sound alid rhyth-

State Cagcrs Aim For Second Straight Triump

 

 

plint With New Paltz Tomorrow Night In Page Gym

2;»..7/1. 3W Cagers Roll Up

By non ASHFIELD

If all the basketball courts around
the circuit which the Feds will play
on this winter had the same di-
mensions as that of our own Page
hardwood, there would be no doubt
as to State’s superior team. Coach
Hathaway’s men could even go as
far as to go through the rest of
the season undefeated, with their
greatest test, as we see it, coming
from Plattsburg State.

Just to verify this statement, let
us look at the past records of
State—at home and on the road.
Last year State lost 2 games at
home, one to Maritime Academy,
and one to Pratt. On the read they
lost some 7 games. The ])l‘eVl-
ous year, State lost only one at
Page, that being the first game .of
the year, again to Maritime, while
losing 6 on other courts. There is
no need to delve further into the
records, as all the results are sim-
ilar to those stated.

It is true that playing on a home
court generally results in the ad—
dition of a couple of wins to the
books due to playing on a familiar
court. But when a team holds such
an impressive home record, some
other factor must be the cause. If
we look back over some of the
games that State lost last year,
we see that State lost by one point
in New Haven on their big court,
while they turned them back here
decisively. State bowed to the
Utica Tangerines in an overtime
tilt there last year, while winning
easily at home—they, too, had a
respectable size court. Other re-
sults can be cited that point to the
fact that State's grammar school
gym is their toughest opponent. No
team can be expected to do well
on a larger court when they are
accustomer to a small one—and
through the campaign just take no-
tice of how the Feds stack up
against their opposition at home
and on the road.

To consider the same problem
through another angle—the spec-
tators—we doubt if very much has
has to be said on this. It is im-
possible to sit in the bleachers and
watch a game without having to
use your imagination to overcome
the blind spots set up by those
pillars. It is needless to say that
a better representation of Albany
fans would frequent the games if
we had an adequate court both for
the players and the spectators, be-
cause they would. Comments from
various Albanians confirm this.

To say that we need a new gym
would be the understatement of the
decade. So, since State is in the
process of expansion with respect
to annexes, coursess of study, and
general facilities, why can’t our
which for a gym be given some
consideration at least?

Maybe if we are real good, Santa
Claus Would put a plan in our
Christmas stocking.

Big 1M Scores

With intramural basketball en—
tering its second week of play.
many teams are already showing
mid-season form.

In loop action last week, the
power-laden Potter Club "nosed"
out Sayles 64-19. The game proved
to be nothing more than a prac-
tice session for the State Street
boys. Erv Horowitz had 14 for the
victors. while Fred Willis hooped
in 10 for the Sayles team.

APA in Easy Victory

APA took their opener by halid-
ing the Vets a 53-21 trouncing.
Jim Bonnet paced the attack for
the frat men with 17. Hank Mul-
ler's nine represented the best ef-
fort for the Vets.

"Apathetic" was the word as the
Soccoinen handed the Apathetics a
64-29 lacing in Wednesday's other
affair. Individual scoring honors
of the game went to the Soccomen‘s
Al Rocklein with 17 and the Apa-
thetics‘ Bob Sinklcdam with 13
markers.

In Saturday‘s final game Jack
Hughes and Bob Smith lcd 51.8 to
their first victory of the young sea-
son by defeating Van Dcrzce 66-29.
Smith had 18 and Hughes 16. Ron
Ganslow scored 13 for the losers.
The easiest victory of the day was
gained by the Indians as they were
awarded a forfeit over Ridge.

In a lowscoring tussle playcdlust
weekend, the. Apaches found them—
selves on the short end of a 33—26
score against the Finks. Sam
Krchniak was the only player able
to hit double figures as he found
the i'iuigc for 11 points.

Rooters Invincible Thus Far

The men from Hilltop were hand-
ed thcir second defeat of the sca-
son Monday at the hands of the
Booters. The socccrmen, switch-
ing uniforms for the scasmi, arc.
proving to bc as proficient in the
loop game as on the soccer field.
Elli Lindbcrg. star of thc Boot-

IM Keglers 011
To Fast Start,-
Tight Race Seen

Intramural bowling got off to a
fast start Tuesday with four teams
ill)ll' to gain shutouts over their
opponents.

The \‘ctcran bowlers finding their
arms a little weary after a sea-
son's layoff, nevertheless came up
with fairly good scores. Many men.
bowling for the first time, showed
great promise. The two groups—
veterans and beginners—should form
a league which will prove tight in
competition.

’I‘oni Shuinaiiski and Joe Duran,
the two IM bowling league officers,
paced the league with 516 and 497
triples respectively.

Tom's games of 169, 167. and 180
led his SLS squad to a 4-0 victory
over Siiylcs. In pinnage, it was
SLS 2359. Sayles 1987. Single game
honors for the match. as well as
the league, went to John Zidik, who
rolled a 194.4 Fred Willis‘ 448 rep-

resented the best effort by the
mcn of Partridge Street.

APA, paced by Ted Duprey's
opening game of 183 and Joe
Durim‘s high triple. downed the

Hilltop kcglcrs 2255-1843. Duran's
games were 182, 156, aiid 159. Joe
Swicrzowski‘s 184 single and two-
gulnc total of 327 led the men from
Collcgc Heights.

The Rouscrs made it a colnpletc
swccp o\cr Potter Club by splitting
the maples for 1984 as against 1866
by the State Streetcrs. Bill Smalls
441 triplc led the Rouser victory,
while Bruce Marsh had 415 for the
Polici' men.

LeRoe's Lest Second Tallies And
Centre's 21 Points Pace Pods In
Victory Over Willimentic College

The State College hoop squad will be attempting to get
their organization further on the victory trail tomorrow
night when they clash with the highly-rated New Paltz “5.”
The Statesman began their skein last week with a scintil-
lating 72-to-71 triumph over Willimantic State Teachers of
Connecticut. If the saying “It takes the champions to win
the close ones” is true, the Hathawaymen bear observation
for championship material. The Hathawaymen are now
sporting a one-win, one-loss record, having dropped their
opener to RPI.

Last week’s clash was a real thriller of the Frank Mer-
riwell degree, the outcome being decided by a pair of free
throws with one second remaining. Nels LaRoe earned a
great share of the State laurels by
coolly notching the game-winning

  conversion.
