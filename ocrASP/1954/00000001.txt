No Time Like
Snow Time

No, you weren‘t seeing things
Wednesday night. That was a
paper bag ﬁlled with snow cra-
dled in the arms of a “Scrubby”
Sophomore. As the cupboard.
otherwise known as the window
sill, had grown bare of snow. it
was fortunate that the weather
man had produced a reasonable
facsimile.

The object of the game? Ven-
geance. A predated snow ball
light from opposing window sills
lay in the back of Scrub's mind
when she dumped her little
bundle of intricately carved
particles of crystallized vapor
in the center of the room of the
two most astonished snowball
soldiers in Pierce "all.

A neighboring “Dennis the
Menace” put his linger in the
pie, too. At suppertime lie charg-
ed in the front door, dropped a
junior-size glacier over the ban-
nister and shouted. in his most
butlerish tone.“Dlnner is served."

State Forwards

Hypothetical

Resolutions For The New Year

This New Year should see some
changes made iit State. Posters,
pamphlets and picket lines are in
the milking. Campaign managers
may start their plans for the term
immediately.

We in the P0 are looking for-
ward to ll fiill paper on Tuesday
night and u larger News stuff than
Sports stuff. if the lights hold up
through the semester. that alone
would make for a brighter and
better your.

lillcvuiors or escalators should be
ordered for third floor classes. If
the expense is too high. how about
rope cutwuiks between Draper-
llusted and I-luslcd-Iticlinrdson.

Wouldn't you like to see our Coin-
iiioiis clean? The installation of ii
iilc floor and one hundred giant-

ccononiy-siw ash trays would be
the biggest step toward luiprovc-
inciits. A subsidiary movement
would be the hiring of bouncers
to oust. violators of the cigurcltc-
coke bottle campaign. ()n the
clciiiiiiness side of the fence also,

could be placed it cafeteria bright-
ci', neuter and sweeter.

Minnie. our inspiration. would

look more inspiring in ii ncw mantle
of whitewash.

Recent usScinbly discussion seems
to prove conclusively that we are
looking for il new and more w'iirk-
iiblc student govcriiiiicni. This year
should see the first rcprcscntiiich
form of government initialed at
State, if the special committee can
put their pliins into final action.
