EXAMINATIONS on ma axe

Christmas vacation has its joys—that pleasant re-
lief from lethargic lecturers, terrifying tests, and the
unfortunately short feeling toward one’s fellow man
called the Christmas spirit. But with the good. comes
the bad, and the sickening sensation of impending
exams has no doubt been widely felt. In this week’s
News you will note the scheduling for those (ugh)
examinations. Complain as we may, this time of
year is inevitable and the only thing to do is assume
all air of resignation, retire to a quiet place (any
bar with less than twenty mahogany maulers) and
resolutely go over those notes that suddenly seem
so poorly organized. After checking your house files,
consulting with people who have had the colu‘se be-
fore, elevating seventeen benedictions to Buddha.
stocking up on No-DOZe, and examining lightly a
tedious test, you should feel secure that a good solid
C. is guaranteed.

 

Gov't Revision Again . . .

The Good Government Committee met
last Wednesday evening after Student
Council adjourned. Although the chair-
man was absent (which perhaps might in-
dicate a lack of interest?) there were about
eighteen members present. The GGC heard
a complete new plan for representative gov-
ernment based on the plan submitted last
year by Joseph Lombardi. Due to the late-
ness of the hour and the indefinite goals
of the committee, the meeting was ended
after a short and circumventing discussion
on the plan presented.

It has been proposed to reorganize the
committee at the next Student Council
meeting. A need for more specific goals
is apparant, as well as a need for more
conscientious leadership. Now that the
amended motion to discontinue compulsory
assembly has been passed, the work of the
committee is important to the future of
government at State. The passing of the
motion guaranteed to the committee that
any work it does will not be in vain, as was
the case last year. Compulsory assembly
will continue until the acceptance of a new

government plan. The committee is open the student that is Sincere and profound (take heed
to all members of Student Association who of this unsolicited praise, all you gold-hearted lovely

are interested in completing such a plan. RePWntatwe gnawing“: ---  instructors).
