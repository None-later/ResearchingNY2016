Faux-pos

With clean blackboards and
fresh chalk, the profs prepared
for a new semester at State.
After it trying test tussle, there
were even new rcd pencils, pre—
trained at rendering nice, round
marks.

Two language teachers brushed
aside the cobwcbs, unlocked the
doors, set up their notes and
prepared for the class to arrive.
No one showed. Why? It was
Monday!

German and French verbs
hung in thin, empty air as the
two most stunned linguists in
Draper pondered their lost pu-
pils. They finally decided not
to report the cuts of their stu-
dents.

Maybe they were happier
about their tardy classes than
imagined. No one really likes
to forfeit a day's rest for a
roomful of sleepy people.

Well, it's better late than
never. Where were you Mon-
day?
