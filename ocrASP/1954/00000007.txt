Urchins Unite, Sororities Release Themes For Weekend:
To Close Rushing With Bullets, Dinners

Greek Sisters Will Entertain
Freshmen With Food And Fun

This weekend will climax the rushing of freshmen

Snow Flies

If those pennies falling from
heaven seemed a little large and
wet and heavy it isn't very un-
usual. With all that snow on
the ground, who can blame the
Albanian cherubs for construct-
ing lee cannonballs?

The main ski jump runs be-
tween Draper and the dorms,
with the State stooges headlin-
ing the bill. Every store, stump
and street is patrolled by the
would-be brigands.

One enterprising Soph fcmme
undertook to take to the chase
and got more than she bargained
for. In taking the Albany High
circuit, her foes gained reinforce-
ments and loaded their ammuni-
tion with rotten apples.

The more subtle approach to
the adversary is the shy one.
Sweet, unassuming smiles in the
face of danger often cause fear
and retreat by bashful bullies.

 

Reading Class
Will Reconvene
In New Seriesl.

The first in the series of eight
meetings ol' the personal reading
improvement classes will meet at
3:35 pm. in Room 123 of the Milne
School on Monday, February 22.

All State College students inter-
ested in receiving aid in their read—
ing speed or comprehension should
leave their flames with Mrs. Fram-
ccs Thomson in ihc Student Per-
>lllllll‘l Office, Draper ill).

'i'Wo groups participated in lhcsc
classes last semester. After ittlcnd—
me, five class sessions, twelve of the
fourteen freshmen had an avcragc
increase in reading speed of two
hundred and twenty-four words
per minute. The reading compre-
hension improvement averaged
(‘lLtllll' pcr ccnl or bcffcr, Two |)ll-
pils did not show satisfactory pro-
gress. ’l‘hc other group. composcll
of u])pcrcluSsincu. progressed snfis-
fuclorily. The average increase ol'
rcading spccd in this group was
two hundrcd and sixty-two words
per minute.

Although there are no assign-
incnls oi' necessary outside prepar-
ation, progress is more rapid if ap-
proximately one hour per week out-
side of the class period is spcnl on
rcudlng.

 

GRC PrOposes
Number To Sit

ln Legislature

The Government Revision Com-
mittee. headed by Kathleen Ander-
son '54 met Wednesday night after
an unsuccessful meeting Friday.
There was a great deal of discus—
sion on the number of representa—
tives deemed practical and yet
democratic, to be elected to the
legislature. A debate on Thomas
Dixon‘s motion that the number be
set at fifty followed. Some mem-
bers of the committee i'elt that
fifty was too small a number lo
represent the entire student body.
Dixon‘s plan was defeated and oth-
er possibilities were considered.
Marilyn Spegele ‘55 then moved
that the legislative body should
not exceed 100 members. Frances
Allen '54 seconded it and the mo-
lion was passed. How and when the
legislators would be elected was
discussed. Dixon '55 moved that a
constitutional test be given to all
those nominated to the legislature
similar to the tests now given. Sar-
ah Jan Duffy '57 seconded it and
the motion was passed unanimous-
ly. Sylvia Seinmlcr  former
President of Election Commission,
advised fhc committee as to
changes in the Constitution re-
garding the Election Commission.
The following suggestions wore
made: Thrcc Junior members. in-
stead of lwo. would be appointed
in the Commission by Student
Council two weeks after Moving"-
Up Day of their Sophomore year;
two Juniors rather than one Would
be appointed in December of‘ their
Junior year by Student Council.
One of lhc Seniors not becoming
pi'csidcnf shall be appointed Sec-
retary of the Commission. The du-
ties of the Election Commission

ing nominees f'or Myskania and the
legislature as well as for those of-
ficers who become members of Stu-
dcnl Council. Dominick DeCecco ‘57
movcd that the suggestions be in~
corporatcd into the Constitution.
Miss Allen seconded it and the mo-
tion was passed. Mary Ann John-
