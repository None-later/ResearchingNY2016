Progress. . .

The Government Revision Committee
met twice in the past week, and with good
resultsto show for their time and effort.
The improved organization of the commit-
tee has resulted in efficient leadership and
cooperative exchanges of ideas. We find a
brighter future for the revision plans now
that irrelevant discussion and frustrating
stalemates are being kept in check by the
new chairman. A summary of the accom-
plishments of the past two meetings is
reported on page one. The committee wel-
comes any SA member to attend and con-
tribute to the meetings. Although quite a
bit has been accomplished, it is only a start
toward the completion of an acceptable
plan to replace our present form of gov-
ernment and eventually discontinue com-
pulsory assemblies. We are not in the
habit of making predictions, but as things
stand now, we wouldn’t advise anyone to
forget their seat number and refer to com—
pulsory assemblies as a thing of the past.

The number of representatives has been
decided at one hundred, to be divided pro-
portionately among classes. Although the
ballot tallying involved many seem appall-
ing, we wonder if there are one hundred
students available and willing to serve in
this representative legislative body. We
Wonder many things about the proposed
representative government plan: what will
happen to rivalry? what will become of
Myskania? how many tight little cliques
will evolve from this plan? and most dis—
turbing of all, will the new plan even ap-
proach being as democratic as the plan we
are now proceeding to discard so casually?

This last question is not very valid in the

light of the generally assumed fact that a
representative form of government repre-
sents the will of the majority at this time.
The slim majority vote that showed our
preference for discontinuing compulsory
assemblies must, considering our present
constitution, represent the majority’s de-
sire for a revised student government. But
must it necessarily represent its desire for
a representation in government of approxi~
mately fifteen to one?

The committee is working hard. They
need suggestions, opinions, constructive
criticism. They are trying to bend to the
will of the majority without discarding tra-
ditions that have stuck because of their
intrinsic value to the school.

whether the pin was from a sorority
or a fraternity? Speaking for yours
truly, it was two weeks before we
found out that APA was a fra-
ternity.

Lunches came to be a dread.
There were invitations to Join th
sororities for a small chat. But
have you ever seen the poor rushees
trying to find the correct luncheon
date in that mob? We were foolish
enough to ask a group directions.
Alas, it was the wrong sorority!

Then there is the situation when
you see opposing sorority repre-
sentatives approaching from two
sides with that gleam in their eyes
and smiles on their faces. Then we
look for the nearest phone booth,
frantically.

After parties, we invariably came
away with a collection of printed
match books. Then ensues the ter-
rible problem of lighting a cigarette
without letting the sorority girl who
stands next to you notice that the
match book is not from her sorority.

All the girls are having talk ses-
sions and the question always is,
“Which one are yoti for?" We con-
sider the happy countenances of
the independents and the well-rest-
ed look they seem to have. We
have a violent argument about
which sorority Sophie is in. We
haven't time for the things we
want to do now, and, after all, we
always spend Monday night study-
ing. When else is it quiet enough?
Is it worth it? Well, the sorority
sisters look satisfied themselves.

Bids to formal weekend are ii-
naliy released and there are, of
course, disnppoliitincnts itnd much
general floating on clouds, pliik or
blue, accordingly. We‘ve heard of
thc cxpcricncc of being handed one
bid and thc proud possessor is
caught in time to be asked to please
come pick tip two more they over-
looked. Then there is the problem
of making sure to check the right
party. There are some of us who
are so frustrated by now as to for-
get. for ll inonicnt what they are
doing. ’i‘hcn follows it rattled nt-
tcinpt to discover which party we
are obligated for. We have for-
gotten which one we chose.

Wc Inch made our decisions and
have come out oi the rush and con-
i'iision to the silent period and now
iic must not speak to the sororities
wc iirc now good friends with. Our
decisions, Wt‘ hope, will be happy
mics and this weekend we will make
them final and exit from the pain-
lici‘cti role of "itushce" to the "Hon-
ored Place of Pledge."

With the problem newly settled
within ourselvos, all freshman girls
must admit, we have a soft place
in our hearts for the befuddled
freshmen of 1054.

SH!

We heard of an ugly incident that took place in
the Commons this week. A freshman girl sneezed,
and, without thinking, a sorority girl said, "Gesund_
hetti" Naturally, the sorority girl has been widely
condemned among right-thinking elements on the
campus. After all, if we are going to have silence
rules, they must apply to everyone, even in cases of
such dire emergency. There must be no exception
to this kind of organized assininity. Rules are rules.
and if they give the college a high school atmosphere,
we had no deIUSions of adulthood anyway, did we?

WHOOPS!

We came to school to the tune of “The Skater‘s
Waltz" this week; it really makes it almost fun to
battle the elements, especially the coating of elegant
stuff on all sidewalks, which freezes, melts, freezes.
melts, freezes and—oh well, winter in Albany!

FLASH!

While walking through lower Huested this week we
caught sight of a number of purple and gold pennants,
advertising everything from Corsages to wholesale
drownings. With minds ever on the alert for neWs,
we paused, thought and like a flash we realized—
State Fair! Right—the big carnival is coming—March
iii—start saving your pennies.

LUV!

Are you cognizant of the fact that Sunday is the
big day? It's the day when your sweetie should get
a gold necklace, a pair of hand-knit knee warmers,
a big box of Life Savers, or a card from the Co-op.
Check on those crazy cards by Diamond—we like the
one that says, "So what if you’re ugly? I still love ya'."

SPLASH!

We dropped in briefly to this week‘s Myskie meeting
to find the Terrible Thirteen deeply involved in a dis-
cussion of world shaking importance. In the heat of
the debate, Miss Payne raised the searching question,
“How many squirts in a water gun?" This left us
trembling with anticipation for State Fair, when we
may have a chance to find out.

"MM!

Having checked with the administration about tlic
scholastic issue raised in this coiuinn last week, we
find that some of our fears about the number of fresh-
man drop-outs may have been exaggerated. The class
seems to have survived their first semester remarkably
well. Furthermore, we were glad to hear oi' the
guidance that was given to freshmen having scholastic
difficulty. Nevertheless, we still feel quite strongly
about what we feel is the danger of having all fresh-
men dorms. Although we are aware of the admin—
istrative difficulties raised by a policy of having
upperclassmcn in every dorm, we insist that upper-
classmen do provide a healthy steading iiti’lucncc so
necessary in group life.

SYMI’ATHY

We Should like to extend our sympathy to thc resi-
dents and alumnae of Newman Hall for the loss ol
their housemother. Mi's. Battle had served in this
capacity for two years. She will be much missed lil
Newman and at the many college social affairs in
which our houseparents take part.

Neophyte:
Enter P 0.

Fresh journalists foiled the
efficient news stuff this week.
After a semester of cub classes,
the typewriter wheels opened
the doors of the PD. to the as-
piring asterisks and let them
try their hands at murdering
the deadline.

For about an hour and a half
stories hopped out of eager
minds onto copy paper under
the approving glances of hov-
ering Gehrig and Eldred. Soph
literaries had to pound out
news thicker and faster for fear
of losing,’ their soft jobs.

Even “Chief” sat back with
that satisﬁed smile when every-
one is workinjg and sweetly
bellowed, “Isn't the paper full
yet? At this rate the paper will
come out Monday."

It's always good to see eager,
young. aspiring reporters doing
the dirty work in the news of-
fice. Anyone need a slightly
rundown box writer?

If we plrint jokes, folks say we're
all ,

If we don’t. they say we are serious.

If we publish original matter, they
say we lack variety.

If we publish things from other pe-
pers, we are too lazy to write.

If we rush news, we’re not doing
our work in school.

 

Party To Honor
Faculty Author

In commemoration of the publi-
cation of his initial book, “The
French Corporative Theory, 1789-
1948," Matthew H. Elbow, Assist-
ant Professor of Social Studies, will
be the guest of honor at a book
party to be held in the John Mistle-
toe Book Store.

All students and faculty members
of State College have been cordially
extended an invitation to attend
the literary event, which will take
place on Thursday, from 4-6
pin. at the shop on 49A Dove
Street, Albany.

Dr. Elbow will be in attendance
to autograph books and answer the
inquiries of persons who wish to
gain further details about the book,
which is the first of Dr. Elbow’s
works.

Dr. Elbow has the following to
say in regard to the publication.
“This book is a history and analysts
of corporative ideas in France in
the 19th and 20th century, cul-
minating in the study of Petain's
regime and DeGaulle’s recent pro-
nounceinents favoring corporatism."
Dr. Elbow explains that, “corpora-
tism is an attempt to attain social
peace through the abolition of
strikes. the establishment of com-
pulsory arbitration, and the joining
of employers and employees into a
single organization."

Dr. Elbow did much of his re-
search in Paris, France and the New
York Public Library.

ENDRENY

If we don’t print contributions, we
don’t show proper appreciation.

If we do print them. The News is
filled with trash.

Like as not, some person will say
we took this from another paper.

And so we did. From the “Moor-
ing Mast," Pacific Lutheran Col-
lege.

. . . well, we can't win, but we've
nothing to lose, so here's another
little tidbit. . . from Hill Whispers,
State University of New York,
Cobleskiil.

A girl, shopping for her brother,
noticed an attractive pair of men's
pajamas, asked the price.

“42.50,” answered the clerk.

"For $42.50," announced the girl.
“they should have a man in theml"

For this week's Contribution to
the Dissolution of Poetry, we have
a “Terse Verse" from the above.

The glances over cocktails

That seemed to be so sweet,

Don't seem quite so amorous.

Over shredded wheat.

Group To Show
Foreign Movies

A new group called The Inter-
national Film Group has been or-
ganized at State by Hanna Wilfert
‘56. French, German, Italian, and
possibly Swedish films will be
shown during the present semester
to members of the society.

Membership can be obtained by
the payment of one dollar instead
of a separate charge for each ﬂint
showing. There must be a mini-
mum of eighty members. About
ﬁfty are signed tip at present, states
Miss Wilfert.

The ﬁrst ﬁlm will be presented
in the beginning of March and will
probably be in French. The group
intends to show about four films
during the semester. One of the
films scheduled is “Emil und die
Detektive," now being read by the
first year German classes.

 

Prom Committees

At a meeting of the Junior Class
yesterday, discussion centered about

Junior Prom, and John Orser, Vice-
Presldent of the class, announced

voted upon by the class, either in
Assembly or in class meeting.

The prom is part of a weekend
