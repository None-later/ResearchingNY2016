By JOHN LAIN G

_—-——-——

Tuesday evening’s plays presented
works of two of our greatest dram-
atists. The first, a Russian farce
by Chekhov, was directed by Joan
Carlin. This play was, on the whole,
very entertaining, however, it was
not lacking in "faults. Most start-
ling was the obvious overacting em-
ployed by the male members of the
cast in various scenes. True, the
play is a farce, but to be funny
one need not revert to slapstick and
over-use of the facial muscles. Don
Murdock was the chief offender in
this matter. One example was his
business with the cigarette. This
could have been very amusing had
h enot played it to broadly. Too
much of a good thing can spoil even
the best acting. I feel that Mr.
Murdock does not realize the im-
portance of subtlety in comedy, and
therefore, missed the boat in his
performance.

John Orser’s portrayal of the fa-
ther was a good performance, al-
though he, too, fell victim to the
aforementioned fault. His walk, at
times, seemed unfortunate, for I
wasn’t sure whether the audience
was laughing at the character or at
John Oser walking strangely. I
fear the latter to be true. This
brings up the point of whether We
want to appear comical, or if we
feel that the character portrayed
would be funny in a similar cir-
cumstance. Every chance for laughs
need not. be grabbed at, for in so
doing, characterization can and will
suffer. Mr. Orser showed excellent
use of his voice, the deep, guttural
tones being very effective.

Theresa Barber, as the daughter,
was a delight. God gifted her with
a strong set of lungs, and she sure-
1y made advantageous use of them.
She maintained the character of a
healthy Russian girl throughout the
play, in voice, gesture, and facial
expression. In the argument scenes
both she and Mr. Murdock reached
effective acting.

Technically, the play was good.
However, Orser‘s beard was dis-
tracting, due to its distinct black-
ness as compared to the grey of his
hair. His padding could have been
more realistic, thus preventing any
laughter evoked by seeing John
Orser padded. Miss Carlin should
be happy with her production, since
its faults did not outshine the in-
trinsic comedy of this play, as evi-
denced by the audience's delighted
response.

The success of the second play
gives evidence of the mastery of
Shaw and shows fine taste on Fran
Verven‘s part. Her play began de-
lightfully with the introduction of
the characters by the director.

.___—-——-

When the curtains parted for the
second scene, the audience was in
a mood for fun, and this was ac-
complished by the overall compe-
tence of the cast. This second
scene was somewhat slow, but was
completely acceptable after viewing
the third scene, which was well-
paced.

Doris Mehan gave a fine perform—
ance as the flower girl. Her cock-
ney accent was not at all times
constant, however it was accepta-
‘ble. In the second scene, Miss
Mehan did not gain all the sym-
pathy possible, but seemed to con-
centrate on the comedy of her
character. Needless to say, it was
funny. The last scene was a tri—
umph for Dottie, I believe. Her
evenly-paced speech became riotous
when combined with her aloofness
and so perfect posture.

Rick Tritto put a great deal of
comedy, with his intonations, into
the already funny lines. His char-
acterization was constant, and his
excellent stage presence added to
the smoothness of his portrayal.

Sonya Bush was humorous as the
fussy housekeeper, and Con Regan
was adequate in the role of the
colonel. Supporting roles were well-
handled, with Arlene Yanks, John
Orser, Betty Lashuk, Nancy Light-
hall, and Betty VanVlack making
the most of their roles. Mr. Orser
proved how good a small role can
be made and also how much atten-
tion can be attracted through ges-
ture and facial expressions. Miss
Verven‘s movement was well worked
out, adding to the smoothness of
the production.

On the whole, a good time was
had by all, and everyone, from di—
rectors on down to the crew mem-
ber who almost got a curtain call,
should be commended. I only wish
that more people would turn out
for these plays, even on cold, snowy
evenings.

State Seeks Revenge Against New Haven Team;
Hopes To Extend Present Winning Spree In Page

 

 

27m'7h 8W4 Duran Bowls New High Triple;
HiIIfoppers Snap Losing String

By non ASHFIELD

 

Those who support the theory
that athletes are born not made
laid better retract their line of
winking for‘the moment and con-
~._ler a ballplayer here at State
whom we feel is a. prime example
i. the developed star. He is none
.rher than " John Centra, Captain
: I this year's varsity ﬁve.

John, who doesn't hold any out-
standing high school records, as
many of our ballplayers do, has cer-
tainly made up for it with the su-
perior brand" of ball he is able to
display on'the court now. John
didn't even make the varsity as a
freshman, but before that first year
had ended had worked himself to
the top of the heap in the junior
varsity class.

Even as a Soph on the varsity,
he wasn't the whiz you might ex-
pect him to be, but you could see
improvement and room, too, for
more improvement. We have seen
John play many a game of ball
over the past three years and claim
that he has steadily closed the gap
between an average ballplayer and
a great ballplayer. His great show-
ing so far this season is ample
proof of his ability.

To describe John's methods and
actions as a ballplayer on the court
would be impossible since we find
no words geared for such
scrlbable antics. You could say his
outside shooting has deadly accur-
acy, but his inside shots are gotten
away at fantastic angles, when in
impossible positions——all with a
talented touch. We like to think
that even a Cousey hasn't a reper—
toire of shots like John‘s.

As is usually expected of the
(.iptain of any team, John has puc—
cd the team in the scoring column
most often this season, and recent-
1y had a great two games of 31 and
:2 points against Plattsburg and
Potsdam respectively. John's output
of 31 matched that of Plattsburg‘s
great star, Jim Sears, who is aided
by a considerable height advantagc.

We are not classifying Centra as
being a greater and better ball-
playcr just because he scores more
points than before. but also because
his floor game lpassing, dribbling,
rebounding, etc.) and his team
generalship are tops. The fact that
he was chosen captain of this
year‘s aggregation indicates the
conﬁdence the rest of the team has
111 him and the guys who play with
him can‘t be fooled.

John will be closing out. his col-
lcge ball here at State within the
next ﬁve or six weeks, and he seems
destined to reach the goal of su-
premacy set by the former cup-
niins whom we remember, "Brown—
1c" and “Tabe,” who, too. were
such stalwarts for the Purple and
Gold. All we can say is "hats off
'o a great ballplaycr and a great
guy" and "the best of luck, John."

In intramural bowling this week,
Joe Duran made everyone sit up and
take notice as he split the maples
for a new high triple. Duran started
with u 190 opener, added a 159 in the
second game and finished strong
with a 211 game to rack up 560
triple. His final game was high for
the afternoon and helped his APA
teammates to a clean sweep over the
Sayles keglers. Ted Duprey backed
up Joe with a 186 single and a 485
triple, Crowdcr‘s 174 for ten frames
and Larry Suffness' 450 were the
leading scorers for the boys from
Partridge Street The APA men won
the first two games by 18 and 13
pins but. led by Duran‘s big game
they won the last one by 117 pins.

Ililltops Losing Skoin Snapped

In the Cannon Ball League‘s other
match. Hilltop House. after 19
straight setbacks, came up with two
big wins over SLS. A 189 handicap
each game, though not adding to the
prestige of the Hilltoppers, neverthe-
less aided tremendously in the scor-
ing column. Edged out by two pins
in the Opcncr. the Hiltop keglers.
aided by their “sixth man" finally
caught fire and knocked the league-
leadcrs from the top, wining the
second game by 142 pins and the
third by 179. Joe Swierzowski‘s 200

single and 508 il‘lllli‘ led the Hill-
uiide— ’ ' ‘ ' "

LaRoe's 'Best Game, Hangs Loss
On Oneonta State Cagers, 86-71 ,

By FRANK McEVOY
State hoop fans will tonight be offered a chance to see
the Feds attempt to make a further expedition on the vic-
tory trail as they tangle with the highly touted New Haven
College Five in the Page Hall Gym. The Statesmen’s recent

splash on the victory scoring

ledger seemingly cleared up

the mystery of cage performance this season.
The Hathawaymen last week were edged out in an
overtime heartbreaker at Plattsburg. Entering the contest

as definite underdogs to the
dinals, State in defeat was

elongated, high flying Car-
every bit as glorious as in

triumph. The clash was sidelig‘hted by Centra’s dazzling,
thirty-one point scoring display.

In the opener Suyles came up with
a thriller over KB. beating the frat
hoopstcrs in a high scoring tussle
56—52. Jim Estromontc proved to be
the big man for Saylcs as he came
throuin with 23 points. Jim, how-
cver, had to hand over scoring
honors of the game to Marv Cher-
noff. who found the range for 25
points.

The night's second contest ended
up with Ridge House squeezing out
the Vets by the score of 41 to 38.
The Vets yet to win a game, looked
somewhat better and stil have hopes
of coming across with the season's
first victory in the near future.

The night‘s runaway saw the
Booters paste the Apaches 56 to 32.
It was evident that. although the
game score was a rout, the individual
scoring was evenly shared. The
Booters were led by Joe Stella‘s and
Don Coronica's thirteen. Phil Kane
and Frank Scarzfara paced the
losers with 12 points each.

Peds Paste Potsdam

The following eve the Statesman
added greatly to the opinion that
they are a Grade A aggregation by
their impressive victory over Pots-
dam State. Scoring honors of the
night and of the road spree Were
collected by John Centra whose
twenty-two markers on Saturday
brought his weekend total to fifty-
threc counters.

The win skein was furthered by
Wednesday's Ped win over a top-
notch Oneonta State quintet. In one
of til-,- most spectacular contests of
the year the Hathawaymen favored
the meager Jage Gym crowd with a
scoring barrage which iced the con-
test in the first period. Contribut-
ing to the 86 to 71 victory tally were
stunning performances by Nels La
Roe, John Centru and Gerry Mc-
Donald who nctted twenty-one, nine-
teen and eighteen counters respec-
tively. The La Roe, Centra, Mc-
Donald and Company outfit staged
l nineteen to eight first stanza
splurge and inalntained their margin
throughout despite valliant efforts
by the opponents.

State Meets Rough Opposition

Tonight‘s clash should be the de-
:iding factor in the question of
whether the Feds have decided to
utilize their vast hardwood talents.
In the previous meeting between the
Mo clubs New Haven claimed the
longer side of the scoring count by
a mere three point advantage. This
encounter too featured an initial
frame scoring display by State but
the persistant and steady play of
the ‘Conn." men decided the out-
come.

Walker Indicates Return To Form

In favor of the Statesmen in the
clash this eve will be the consis-
tency of the sharpshooting quintet
of Centra. LaRoc. Smith and Mc-
Donald. Recent hoop activity has
developed the impression that last
campaign's high scorer Bill "Hiram"
Wulker has decided to make encores
on last year's performance. Although
starting slowly this season Bill has
in recent contests given displays of
scoring prowess of old.
