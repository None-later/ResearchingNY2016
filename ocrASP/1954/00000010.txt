commend to President Collins that
this period be kept open. The mo-
tion was seconded by Dixon and
passed. The relationship of Stu-
dent Council to the legislature was
then discussed. It was decided that
members of student Council would
not be compelled to attend legis-
lature meetings but were advised
to do so. Various suggestions were
made as to whether the ofﬁcers of
Student Council should be the of-
ficers of the legislature. It was felt
that this could be more thei'OUghly
discussed after Myskania has in-
vestigated into the Major-Minor
office plan. Miss Anderson asked
that she be given the power to ask
members of the committee with
two unexcused absences to resign.
The committee unanimously agreed.
it was recommended that Student
Council appoint both Faith Hanson
and Fritz Crumb, Seniors, as vot-
ing members of the committee.
Wednesday night after Student
Council meeting there will be a
meeting of the Govornment Revl-
slon Committee, anyone interested
is invited to come.

Dean Releases
Test Information

Applications for the Selective
Service Test that will be given in
high schools and colleges through-
out New York State in April, are
available at the Student Personnel
Office. Dean Hartley wishes to ex-
plicitly state that it is not neces-
sary for men to obtain their forms
from the local draft board. Hart-
ley says that this is a misleading
belief of many State College male
students.

Dean Hartley urges strongly that
all men who have registered for
Selective Service but have not taken
the test, take the test in April re—
gardless of their academic stand-
ing.

Since the test occurs during the
Spring recess, Hartley also states
that the College Qualification Test
Bulletin of Information should be
consulted in choosing the correct
center nearest to one‘s home town.

Silence Ends--

Femmes Frolic

Did you try getting into the
Snack Bar Tuesday evening?
What a mob! And the noise!
After a week of not talking,
those gals were sure making up
for lost time! You had to use
a Boy Scout to get a message
from one end of the room to
the other, though a Girl Scout
would have been more in keep-
ing with the general atmos-
phere. Anyone looking in could
have taken the place for a
meeting of the League of Wom-
en Voters who had come to
discuss the coffee issue. Only
men to be seen were behind the
counter, and they wore a slight-
ly harried look. All they lacked
was Carrie Nation on a soap box.

Well, gals, it's all over for an-
other year. No more lunches,
no more hunting for a rival so
you can have a bit of chit-chat.
with a frosh. No more worry-
ing about this or that. Peace,
it's wonderful!
