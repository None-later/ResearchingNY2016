Brando. for his smooth-oictioncd
performance in Julius Caesar. Best
actress. Ava Gardner, the tempestu-

SC Discusses
Friday’s Agenda

Because of the home basketball
game Wednesday night, the weekly
meeting of Student Council was
postponed until Thursday noon.

Since the twelve members who
came to this meeting did not con-
stitute a quorum, no motions could
be legally considered. However, Neil
Brown '54, President, stated that it“
informal discussion of matters to
be brought up in today's assembly
could be held.

The first question on the floor to-
day will be discussion of the Mys-
kania amendments which were
tabled last week. The main points
of these are: 1. No class president
may succeed himself. 2. No mem-
ber of Mysknnin except the pres-
ident of the Senior Class may be a
member of" Student Council.

Budgets to be presented at this
time are those of Radio Guild and

Also to be brought up is the prob-
lem of whether to finance the send—
lug of a student delegate to the
Eastern States' Association Con-
ference in 11 few weeks. The ex-
penscs of this delegate will come
from surplus, since the College has
no provision for making such ex-
penditures, according to the ad-
ministration.
