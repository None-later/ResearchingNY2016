The following comes from another
Teachers College—State Teachers
College at Trenton, New Jersey,
and their-paper. the suite Signal.

Did you ever stop to realize that
girls who bite their fingernails are
destroying their best protection?

Remember that the next time you
ladies are taking an exam and get
the jitters.

The Auburn Plainsmen tells of a
pertinent sign in a chemical lab:

{‘This is a LABORatory, and not
a labORATO'RY."

An apt definition from the Stu-
dent Liie, the Utah State College
Journal, states that college is just
like a laundry—you get out of it
just what you put in it, but you‘d
never recognize it.

The Paterson State Beacon, State
Teachers College, Paterson, New
Jersey, has this to say about stu-
dent-teacher relationships:

I don‘t talk with the prof after
class.

I don't
upon.

I don't ask questions in class.

I don't speak to the profs in the
balls.

I don't write a book when I can
answer in four sentences.

I .don‘t make excuses when I'm
absent.

I don't laugh at the prof’s jokes
unless they're funny.

I’m on probation.

recite until I‘m called

No State College student could
possibly do that, could they? Hm?

The next two tidbits came to us
via the Campus Capers column of
Central Michigan Life.

Overheard in the Union: "They
can’t put me on probation—my av-
erage is too low."

Some of the classes at Central
Michigan College are becoming
quite overcrowded. In one sociol-
ogy course the students have to
make an appointment two weeks
ahead of time to raise a question
in class.

By BOB ASHFIELD

 

The "will to win” is a great at-
tribute, especially when displayed
by a non-winning team as magnifi-
cently as our junior Peds have done.
No longer are the future varsity
men without the taste of victory,
but it has only been through their
great fight, determination and the
will to win that has brought them
3 straight victories.

It is always tough on a junior
varsity team because they are per-
forming in the shadows of the big-
ger stars. Their games start early,
and they play the bulk of their
game to an audience consisting of
the referees, the coaches, score-
kecper, cheerleaders, and a few
others who want good seats for the
varsity tilt. This isn‘t dishearten-
ing enough, but the publicity media
ignore them almost completely in
favor of the varsity team. No rec—
ognition of time and hard work
put into each practice preparing
for the big games would probably
leave most guys a little dlstatscf‘ul.
Then when you lose those rial close
ones and can't seem to buy :1 vii--
tory, anyone Would have to :l(llIlIi
“there just ain't no justice."

Our Junior Peds experienced just
about every adverse condition in
the book, but they have displayed
in their recent games some real
basketball savvy. ’i‘hcir nmv-f‘ounu
scoring punch. Donnic Nolan, has
unsheathcd great ability in the
last few games and. when he is on,
his spinning jump shots and one-
hand pushes are dazzling. in the
game against Union lost week, we
saw a great display of passing
almost a lost art in basketballwby
Denny Deinpster, :1 new member of
the squad this semester. Denny,
an outside man, also has that good
eye and. with his great bull hun-
dling ability. will add more \‘lciol‘ics
to State‘s ledger.

Hughes, SLS
Set lM Marks

Bob Hughes and his SLS team-
mates stole the show in this week’s
keg‘llng action by shutting out APA
4-0 and thereby creating a dead-
lock for first place in the Cannon—
Ball League.

Hughes established the league's
new high single by smashing out a
superb 244 game. This was one pin
better thiin teammate Tom Shu-
manski‘s old mark. Bob's other
games of 142 and 167 gave him a
553 triple. Jack Zidik, SLS's reli-
able unchol' man. and the league‘s
top kegler, came through with a
big 527 triple. Paced by Hughes’
big game, SLS bowled its way to
11 new high team single (876; and
triple l2421l. Sinklcdnm and Du-
prey led the losers. who put up a
good showing. nevertheless.

In the loop's other match. sixty-

“Wise-led" Snylcs boys, spotting
Hilltop 69 pins i1 game, trounced

fhc “Handlcnppers” 4-0. Bi'ucc hit

were headed by the efforts of Joe

In the Upstairs League, the
Apaches gained sole possession of

while Borden stole match honors

Q

What’s the

THIS

 

With the finale of the 1953-54
Albany court campaign nearing,the
.Ped hoopers this week dispelled
shadows which surrounded their
performance through the season by
turning in highly impressive wins
over Oswego and Utica. Adding
to the prestige of the hardwood
frenzy was the fact that State’s
triumph established a new scoring
record. The 108-94 tally eclipsed
the previous 104 mark twice estab-
lished in State annals. The Os-
wego tilt was awarded Albany for
a 92-80 margin.

The recent cage doings afforded
Ped fans the opportunity to wit—
ness some very fine basketball. As
to opportunities for watching con-
tests, the week was deficient. both
frays being more on the type of
Albany exhibitions. As to the grade

of competition though, exhibition
calibre was not the case. Both op-
ponents entered their trays offering
much. The Utes, possessing height,
speed and a previous win over the
Feds, staked a .9 won-'7 loss history,
while the OSWegans’ early season
brilliant displays were to no avail
as they met a similar fate.

The Statesmen's 10 up, 5 down
record, with theirirecent 5—game
skein, ls gladd’ening‘although sad-
denlng when the observation is
made that their recent perform-
ance hints that their record should
be unblemished.

Highlighting the exhibitions were
7 purple and gold bedecked sphere
swishers. Captain John Centra's
star seemingly shone the brighest
for his 30-point Utica evening and
17-point total against Oswego. A
tally of 26 and some sensational
play earned separate laurels for
Lou Carr. Although starting his
first Albany season slowly, Lou’s
performance. improvement, and po-
tcntiai have gained him the ex-
pectations of carrying his niche in
State loop illuminnries. Bill Walk-
er's 31-point week also earned for
him glory. Bill's performance was
on the calibre of former Bill Walk-
er evenings and a great Walker
“come-back" is being observed. The
traditional mule-dazzle of LaRoe,
Smith. McDonald and Gillespie
gave reason for their recognition
among big guns of Albany's attack.

The Hathawaymen will seek new
fields to conquer this weekend as
they take to the road against Os-
wogo and Harpur. Both opponents
have already felt the taste of de-
feat at the hands of Albany and,
if the Peds‘ present play continues,
the weekend will be repeat per-
formnnces.
