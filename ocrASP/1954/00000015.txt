The final game of the schedule
is always tough both physically and
scntimentally. the latter exerting
more effect, we believe. There are
some seniors on the squad who are
wearing the purple and gold in
honor of State for the last time.
They leave behind the remnants
of a winning combination, a great
learn. or a iair team. as the case
may be.

We feel that the guys who compos-
cd the varsity squad this year were
responsible for a great team, one oi
the best in many ycurs»wln, lose
or draw.

A great team is one Lillll. impi‘ovcs
ll‘iroughout lhc season and learns
through its own mistakes. which is
indicatch oi our tciim as ihcy hch
woii their last eight gnmcs in a row.

Another feature of a great team
is the balance of power: that is.
dependence on not one man to do
all the scoring. rebounding, and
playniaking. but on everyone. .\
breakdown in the scoring statistics
show»: that six of the eight men who
see most of the action have taken

turns in being the leading poliit
producer for State.

Oneonta Clash
Will Terminate
Hoop Campaigrn

The 1953-54 edition of the
N.Y.S.C.T. Albany hoopsters will
this weekend add the finishing
touches to their present season. The
weekend's double bill finale pits
the Feds against the Plattsburg
State powerhouse five tonight in
Page Hall and tomorrow against the
Oneonta teachers at Oneonta.

The Hathawaymen presently boast
a 13-5 record and with two con-
tests remaining are expected to
eclipse the thirteen and seven his-
tory of the '51-'52 campaign which
now stands as the Peds' best since
the war.

Face the Highly ’l‘outed Platte

It is an undeniable and widely
known fact that tonight's contest
Is in top contention for the honor
of being the Peds' best opposition.
The Platts hold a 13-3 record
statistically comparable to State's
18 to 5 mark. The Cardinals also
hold victories over mutual oppo-
nents of Utica College, Oneonta,
Potsdam, Oswego, and New Paltz.
Comprising the remainder of the
Card's chart are: McGill U., Marl-
time, Allen A.F.B. and Lyden S.T.C.
oi Vt., competition rated by many
as of the same calibre as the state
chart.

To the many who take stock of
earlier performance, tonight's tilt
holds much In store. On Feb. 5,
prior to the start of the Statesmen's
seven-game win spree, the upstate
charges of Joe Jastrab in one of
their closest contests turned back
the Albany purple and gold 74 to '15
in an overtime game. The Albany
scare was handed the Cards at the
height of their flying victory drive.

Past the rumor state is the tip-
oi'l‘ to observe Plattsburg's captain,
17-point per game leading scorer,
center, six foot three inch Senior
Jim Soars tonight. Sears. it will
be remembered. collected thirty-one
points In the first State-Plattsburg
outing. Also supposedly bearing
watching will be 6' 1" Doug Mehne
who last year averaged 16 points
per game and presently performs
in that scoring vicinity.

Oneonta Contest Ends Season

With a basis of State's pres-
ent smooth performances and
win skeln and discounting the fa-
ilguc of tonight's fray. the Feds are
scheduled to top the Oneontans Just
as they did earlier this season. The
prior meeting was an all Albany
evening ending in a 86 to '11 tally.
Big guns of the Oneonta attack
shall probably be Jester and Mc-
Carthy, who accounted for 24 and
16 points, respectively, in the earlier
meeting.

In the statistical department,
Centro‘s 282 counters on 103 double-
(lockers and 66 from the stripe tops
the Purple and Gold roster. Smith's
213 on 66 from the field and 81
ion] l‘lips ranks second. Totals of
163 are held by Walker and McDon-
ald and LuRoe's 156 and Carr’s 145
round oiil the lending tallies. The
polls] tossing is led by Smith with
ll 73'? on 111 attempts.

Bringing the proceedings up to
date were wins all and 1:12 notched
last week over Oswcgo and Harpur.
’I‘cmnwork was the feature of both
nlgbis. wilh only one large solo
scorc. Loading scoring in the 62 to
in iriuinph over Hnrpur were Cen-
[rs and lillRUc with 11 points each
lillil Walker and Curr with 10 mark-
crs upiccc. The Osweg‘o tilt was
McDonald night as the Chateaugay
wondcr netted 22 to lead the scoring.
Smith's iii and Contru’s 13 rounded
out honors in State's 83 to ’15 vic-

iory.
