A  From Tomorrow

Seeing Ratty Cooper in the Student Un-
ion last weekend reminded us that March
13 is State Fair, when we all have an oppor-
tunity to contribute to the Foreign Student
Fund and have an evening of fun and en-
tertainment in the bargain. Any upper-
classman who has attended this event in
the past will recall it as being one of the
most interesting and satisfying of all ‘our
extra-curricular events here at State. Since
participation is done by group houses as
well. as organizations, Just about. everyone
On campus from frosh to Myskania artiCi-
pates in this annual worthwhile even . Even
your News staff works overtime to produce
the annual issue of Staid College Guns and
has the nerve to sell it at five cents a copy.

An excellent job of organization and pub-
licity for this affair is very encouraging to
those of us who have seen so many other
events fall through this year. We are look-
ing forward to a record turnout a week
from Saturday and guarantee a good time
to all who attend and partici ate. Come
with a handful of nickels an dimes and
leave with a feeling of school unity from an
unselfish job well done together.

Sports Coverage . . . ‘9,

Today in Assembly, you will be asked to
vote on a new line in the State College News
budget. This new line is unassumineg
called “Sports Coverage” and requests mon-
ey for meals and overnight lodging for a
News sports reporter to cover the away soc-
cerand basketball games. Transportation
is not included in this proposed line because
the Sports Staff has already received per-
mission to travel with the team.

We feel that it is necessary to have a
reporter present at all soccer and basketball
games in order to present fully descriptive
and worthwhile accounts of the games. An
accurate play by play report of a game
cannot be drawn from a scorebook or from
abridged and biased press releases sent out
by the Athletic Association Publicity Bu-
reau. A competent job of reporting team
and individual progress and changes can-
not be done via second-hand information
or box scores.

In the past, this line was not included in
the budget because a member of sports staff
has been a manager of the team, or other-
wise directly connected with the team so
his expenses would come under the team’s
budget. There is no guarantee that in the
future we will have a reporter doing both
'obs at once. In fact, it is quite improbable

ecause of the time-consuming elements of
these two jobs.

An affirmative vote for this new line,
small as it is, will be a vote for improved
and more complete sports coverage. We
owe it to our teams and to our school to
bring about this improvement.

I GWOM

 

To the Editor:

As a freshman interested in stu-
dent government. I would like to
call attention to the present work
of the Government Revision Com-
mittee. for it is evident, that in
their desire to prevent a monopo—
listic control of the school. the
members of this committee have
succeeded in planning a future
government that is partly confus—
ing. complicated and marked with
a lack of cohesion.

This committee's solution to stu-
dent government problcms is a 100-
meinber legislature which on the
surface seems like a really fine
idca. However. the committee is al—
so planning on keeping Student
Council as a governmental force.
despite the fact that Student COllll-
oil is now the legislative branch of
the college, and the proposed stu-
dent lcgislatm‘c will be the legisla-
tive branch of the college. Further.
the committee adopted a resolution
stating that members of the Stu-
dent Council could not be incin-
bers of the new legislature. thus
making two legislative bodies. not
only redundant in purpose but di-
verse in members.

It is the purpose of this commit-
tcc to unify and strengthen our
govcriuncnt. not divide it. Person-
ally. I cull scc no possible reason
why a future Student Council is
necessary. if we are to have a stu-
dent legislature that is workable.
And certainly, if the committee is
to provide for the continuance of
Student Council, it should be in a
more executive manner. with the
members elected from the student
legislature. As it stands now, the
members of Student Council defin-
itely will not be nicmbcrs of the
legislature. voting or otherwise. It
proposes a greater problem in the

out having an adequate knowledge
of any of the candidates. Is there
enough interest in any of the four

It should also be noted. that all
the proposed branches of future
government are to be on a coin-
pulsory basis that very thing that
most of us have been trying to
eliminate in student government.
The realization of the many future
governmental bodies working to-
gethcr lncohesivcly is dangerous
and what is more unexplainable is
that this Government Revision
Group is indirectly trying to
achieve this. especially on the ad-
vice of freshmen who liarc not pos-
sibly had time to study our present
form of government in action.

Would it not be better for this
committee to hold collective meet—
ings with Myskanla and Student
Council. and together adopt feas-
ibic plans that will result in a
uniform government. eliminating
this duplication and diversion? i

DECISIONS AHEAD

Today is the day when the fraternity bids are
handed out. and a larger than usual segment of the
male population of State College will be found in the
Commons glancing furtlvely at the mailboxes. we
would remind prospective pledges to be sure to check
their mail this morning without fall. If you find
a bid or bids there. then it’s time to do some serious
thinking. The question is not which group has
slapped you on the back or lighted your cigarettes
most often. It is really a matter of which men on
campus you would like to identify yourself with for
the rest of your college life.

AMAZING PUBLICITY

For the first time in many a moon the lower peri—
style in Draper gives indication that something is
happening at State. Posters galore proclaim elections.
plays, music and State Fair. It looks like “the good
old days" when the joint really jumped with activity.

FINANCIAL ’I‘ROUBLES

The appropriation from Surplus for Bowling Club
brought up a puzzling problem once more. Why do
we have such a large surplus to which we are con-
stantly adding? And what in the name of Minerva
are we ever going to do with seventeen thousand
dollars. Certainly we do need a source of extra cash
for emergency appropriations, but we are never going
to touch most of the money in the fund. The situa-
tion is ridiculous: we pay a large student tax in the
fall to support campus organizations, these organiza-
tions return their surplus cash at the end of the year.
this goes into our monstrous bank account and the
next September it starts all over again. Seems futile
to go over each line in the budget at interminable
meetings when we know that in the end we'll inevit»
ably add to our boarded thousands.

MUCK AND MIRE

The shining chronic plated modernity of our Student
Union seems to be dimmed somewhat by an excess of
plain old fashioned dirt. While idly tracing our names
in the dust on the window sills. we noticed a greasy
shine on the floor near the end of the Snack Bar.
This sort. of thing is unsightly and unhealthy. The
picture is not improved by the presence of so many
flies looking unusually fat and happy.

ISOLATED IN ASSEMBLY

l'i was lonely in Page Hall last Friday afternoon
Apparently no one let the student body in on the
secret that Assemblies are compulsory They are. you
know. and likely to remain so for some time. Sec
you this ai‘icrnoon.

ceeds will be donated to the For-
eign Students Scholarship Fund.
Coan placed the proposal in the
form of a motion and Council sup-
ported it.

Further nominations were taken
by Brown for representatives to the
ESA conference in March. Discus-
sion was held on the candidates.
Sam Krchniak '56 was elected to
represent State College at the con-
ference.

William Small '56, reported his
findings at the National Student
Association Conference. He reveal-
ed the policies of this intercolleg-
iate organization. Coan expressed
the opinion that we would gain
beneﬁt from membership in this
organization. Council decided to
hear opinions from members of
NSA from other colleges before
reaching a decision.

Discussion then moved to pro-
posed budgets. Faith Hanson '54.
Chairman of Student Board of Fi-
nance presented the State College
News and typewriter pool budgets.
Discussion centered about the new-
ly propost sports coverage line in
the News budget which had been
defeated by SBF. Robert Ashflcid
’55 and Frank McEvoy '57 defended
the proposal. Miss Johnpoli moved
to accept this new line which would
provide for a reporter at all away
games. It was pusst cicvcn to
three. Both budgets were accepted.

Pnync suggested that Council
approve a new member to ﬁll the
position vacated by Robert Burns
'57 on the Government Revision
Cominiticc. Jnmcs Wrinn ‘56 was
appointed.

The agenda for today's assem-
bly is as follows: discussion of the

Brink- Pinkliom Duo Will Stage
Niglif Violin-Harpsichord Recital

Music Council will bring Robert
Brink and Daniel Pinkhnin. Violin-
Hnrpsichord Duo, before a State
College audience at Page Hall
March 12. “The balance between
the two players is all that could be
desired . . . " reveals the Saturday
Review of Literature.

This concert may provide for
many State students their first op-
portunity to sec and hour a harp-
sichord. ihc instrument of Bach's
duy. Through Pinkham‘s cil'orts it
has become niorc popular with illi-
dicnccs.

The harpsichord that Mr. Pink-
hnin will play was made expressly
for him by John Challis. The iii-
striiincni. is cxii'cincly sensitive to
tcmpcraturc changes. and a dif-
ference of 1ch or six degrees radic—
nily affects the timing. It takes the
instrument approximately t )1 r c e
hours to bccornc adjusted to the
ti‘lllpt‘l‘iltlil'l' of thc hull.

Pinkhiini received his musical
cducutlon at Harvard Unlvcrsity.
He poSscsscs an exceptional talent
at the organ us well as on the
harpsichord. He was the recipient
of the Fulbright Award for re-

scarch and study in Europe in the
field of early music and composi-
tion.

He has uppciircd us harpsichord—
ist with the Boston Symphony Or-
chestra i'or more than ll dozen per-
i‘orinanccs and has bccn hcurd i‘rc-
qucntly as organist. harpsichordist
and composer on the Columbia Rn-
dlo Network.

With the violinist. Robert Brink.
he has performed not. only in the
United States but in Germany un-
der a grant from the U. S. Dcpnrt~
incnt of State. playing not only
curly music but also contemporary
American works.

Robert Brink posscsscs n 1734
violin made by Ciiliiiiio di Cniiillii
of Mniiiun. He began his study at
the age of hL‘Vi‘li with his i'niiicr.
He later sliidicd conducting iii the
