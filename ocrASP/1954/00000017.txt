With the coming of Spring weath-

er, it seems that dramatic activi-
ties have also taken an upsurge. We
are now shifting into- high gear
and from now on there’s‘one thing
after another. Tuesday the final
set of AD lab plays will be pre—
sented in Page Hall. These plays
should be Well attended, since they
are both excellent comedies and,
from all reports,
cessful productions. Sonya Bush
directing a scene from a recent
Broadway success, and Harry Warr’s
play is a perennial favorite. The
casts and crews have been working
diligently to perfect these plays, so
let’s turn out “en masse” to create
a rousing finale for this year's sea-
son.
' This Saturday afternoon at 3
o‘clock D&A Council will sponsor
a “lecture and demonstration on
arena theatre in an activity room
at Brubacher. This is the second
Saturday meeting in D&A’s cam-
paign to inform freshmen and other
interested people. Next week will
fihdzthe C‘o‘uncil presenting another
informative program.

Don’t forget the Albany Dramat-
ics Group‘s presentation of The

'_ Heiress at Channing Hall on March

10, 12, and 13. It’s an arena pro—
duction and features .Iohn Lannon
'53, in a role.

On March 15, D&A Council will
present the Life Magazine feature
film and slides, The World We Live
In. Along with the colored movie,
there will be a well-received speak-
er to narrate this faScinating film.
This is a rare opportunity for State
students, since the presentation will
not be open to the general public
until next Fall. In other words,
State will be the scene of a pre-
view, on March 15. Don't forget

this worthwhile and exciting offer-4

RPI Suspends
Two Students

Dr. Richard A. Waite, Jr., Dean
of Students at Rensselaer Poly-
technic Institute, has announced
that two students have been sus-
pended and twenty-one given
failing grades and placed on proba-
tion for pilfering one examination.

The cooperation of student gov-
ernment officers and voluntary test-
imony given by student-offenders
influenced the administration to
withhold the names of the of-
tenders.

The penalty of suspension was
given for pilferlng. Students given
such a penalty may not seek re-
admission for a minimum of one
year.

When I‘pralse the paper
I scorn those who laugh.
I'm really loyal.

Sets Regqutions
For LegisIature

At the meeting of the Govem-
ment Revision Committee this week.
it was decided that the present
Constitution would be changed as
little as possible. Working on the
basis of a one-house legislature, the
committee set up a system of pro-
portional representation according
to classes, based on the present en-
rollment of undergraduates, and
limiting the number of representa-
tives to 100.

Constitutional tests similar to the
ones now given to Student Council
candidates would be given to can-
didates for the legislature. The
officers of Student Council would
be the same as those of the legisla-
ture, but no other member of Coun-
cil would be allOWed to run. A
quorum was set at 4/5 of the com-
plete house.

Myskania. in a joint meeting with
GRC, felt that their (Myskania's)
members should be eligible to sit in
the legislature, as it would be dif-
ficult to fill the offices if they were
automatically unable to run.

The limit of 100 members did not
meet with Myskania's favor, and
50 was suggested as a preferable
number.

Myskaniu approved the followmg:
constitutional tests for legislators,
compulsory attendance at the meet-
ings with two unexcused absenses
a semester, the addition of two
members to Election Commission
and the decision that officers of
Student Council and the legislature
be the same.

We open on a bare stage, set with
chairs at center, left and right. At
the rise, three people enter, from
left, right and center. They sit
in the chairs. They are carrying
tall drinks.

1. Have you seen the new one
who came in today?

3. No, I haven't seen him, but
I‘ve heard about him.

2. Do you think one of us ought
to tell him?

1. You mean about his walk? No.
let him find out himself.

3. I'm beginning to think that
something is wrong with the screen-
ing for this place. They never used
to let the likes of him in here.

2. Maybe the others will take
him. Note: the word others is
spoken with a feeling of horror that
can not be shown on paper. Think
of a dead fish that has been lying
in the sun for a while. This may
help to carry the right feeling over
the footllghts.) (Stage direction:
They all drink.)

3. Did you see Marion last night
at the dance? The way she was
wearing her hair. Didn't we vote
not to have a bob this year?

2. We did! I don't know what's
gotten into her, acting that way.
Why, everybody was looking at her.

1A1. think she ought to be re-
ported.

2. Don't worry, I turned in a
report on her this morning. They
won't let it happen again.

(Note: the word they is spoken
this time with a feeling of rever-
ence and awe, tempered with a
slight tune of fright.)

«At this point, a fourth person
enters and walks slowly from the
right over center. The three sitting
II ok on in horror as he is approach-
ing. They turn as one person and
present their backs to him. He
stops for an instant and then turns
slowly and walks back the way he
came ill.)

1. Well. the nerve of some people,

By FRITZ CRUMI

 

to think he thought we would talk
to him!

3. We ought to report him; they
know better than to come in here.

(Note: They is again the dead
fish.)

2. I thought I was going to be
sick right here.

i. 0. well, let's forget it.

(They all drink again, draining
the glasses. Short pause.)

3. That was good. What shall we
all have this time?

Curtain.

Production notes: This play is
best played in the natural manner.
If the actors will just act as they
do in every-day life, the effect will
be perfect. The tall drinks ought
to be no problem. The best formu-
la we have found is one part lye
to three parts soda water.

There is no royalty on this play.
but we would like program credit
if it Is done for other than humans.
