The Finished Product . . .

Today Student Association will hear the
long-awaited and anticipated report. of the
Government Revision Committee. This com-
mittee, which has been working diligently
since the passing of the motion in Assembly
last fall to discontinue compulsory assem-

blies, has come up with a complete revision
The complete

of our resent constitution. _
report be read in Assembly (which, by
the way, is still compulsory) appears on

page four of your News. This report de-
serves your immediate and concentrated
attention as a paying member of Student
Association.

We think this proposed plan has an ex-
cellent chance of operating efficiently. Al-
though by nature the reVISed plan is not
as democratic as our present system, it
appears to meet the needs and des1res of
SA in a‘very efficient manner. We want
to remind you that this plan does not have
to be passed by SA. If in your.eyes it is
not satisfactory or practical, mirror your
opinion in your vote. Since the report Will
be presented as a constitutlonal amend-
ment, it will be tabled automatically for

one week.

In-the case of a rejection by SA of this
plan, the committee will resume work along
other premises. The only way the commit-
tee can sense the opinions of SA is by your
comments, either in assembly or at future
meetings of the revision group.

After listening for some discussion and
hearing none at the last few assemblies, we
are hoping to see an awakening from the
lethargy of ennui and a revival of vital in-
terest in this most important, revolutionary
issue. From its present perspective of bore-
dome, SA may not realize that this revision
is the most urgent issue to face us in thirty-
five years of Student Government.

The new plan is printed on page four for
your convenience. Please remove it and
review it carefully. We are loking forward
to a stimulating and intelligent discussion.

The Big Day . . .

The big day has arrived—State Fair. As
you know, the proceeds from this event go
to the Foreign Student Fund. Last year
this fund enabled Ratty Cooper from Pak-
istan to come to State, and Ayaat Nashed,
from Egypt, was able to come this year.
Both girls have been wonderful additions
to our student body. Undoubtedly the for—
eign students to come in the future will be
just as wonderful.

This affair can’t go over without your
help. Your pennies, nickels, and dimes
count up fast to make someone happy and
give them an opportunity they might never
have had offered to them. Also, you are
certain to have a wonderful time at the
gain colored booths and concessions that
will transform ordinary, everyday surround-
ings into a bright and cheerful midway.

‘71” Scam! 14nd! 7h 4m

_____————-—

Many students at this college
who for years have heard of the
merits of the moving picture. “The
Informer," released long before
their movie-going days. looked for-
ward to the opportunity to see the
ﬁlm under the auspices of the D&A
Affiliates. The evening turned out
to be a ﬁasco. a disappointment to
the many who attended. a sorry
waste of time. energy and money
for the Affiliates. The reason? The
sound equipment provided by the
Audlo~Visual Department of the
college and the ineptness of the
operator provided by that Depart-
ment.

From the very beginning of the
program the volume of sound was
uncomfortably loud. aiid requests
to the operator produced no inedi-
ﬁcation. Most of the film was a
protracted. deafening jumble. and
as a resut. many of the audience
fled.

Unfortunately. every film brought
to the college is an assault on the
cars of those who attend. After one
of these incidents, D&A Council
inquired into the matter and found
that the sound track of the film
was not at fault. This placed the
ineptitude of the Audio-Visual De-
partment's technicians as the cause.
Consequently. many organizations
have decided that it would hardly
be worthwhile to bring any more
films to the college—at least until
this situation can be corrected. The
program planned by the Foreign
Film Group could be a valuable
and cxciting addition to the college
program. But who is willing to pay

admission to such films with no
assurance that the technical re-
production will bc bearable, let

alone satisfactory? It is no wonder
that the group is having trouble
gaining enough supporters to facil-
itatc the realization of the program.
The assurance of subtitles would be
the only guarantee of milking the
movies coinprohcnsiblc.

it hardly seems logical that this
situation should even exist. Since
ihc collch demands that organiza—
tions who want to show films work
through the Audio-Visual Depart-
incni. it would seem that this do-
piiriincnt would feel obligated to
give the best possible service to the
paying orgiinimition and to the en-
tire student body. A short preview
of the films might avoid iiillcli of
this trouble. Yet, in the past.
through the inisniiiliiigcnicnt of" the
department, tiicsc prcvicvrs have
been nicrcly proliilscd~llot givcii.
Then. too. since the department is
supposedly training students in
that field. it Would seem that they
should expect pcrfcciioii——not coin-
plum bungling.

 

 

  
  
  

By D&A AFFILIATES and FRIENDS__._._————

Because of this. we are losing
the benefit of an important medium
of learning and entertainment. If
the sound equipment is at fault.
certainly the college should replace
it. If the equipment is not at fault
——who is?

Tuesday evening’s plays were the
final of this year's AD lab produc-
tions, and they provided a truly de-
lightful evening of well-timed com-
edy and accomplished performances.
Both directors should be commend-
ed for their jobs and all the actors
should feel proud of their per-
formances.

The first play. directed by Sonia
Bush, presented the complications
involved in a modern love triangle.
Janice Smith gave a sincere warmth
to her portrayal of the young ac-
tress. Jaii has really shown a tre-
mendous growth, I feel. and was
excellent in her role. both physically
and vocally. The softness of her
voice aided in creating the genuine
sweetness of her character. In the
telephone scene. at the beginning of
the second scene. her movement was
technically perfect and finely
achieved. Stan Gutin gave an ap-
pealing performance as the young
soldier. His characterization was
well—maintained and helped keep
the play's constant high level.

The role of the “other woman" is
endowed with many biting sarcasms
and witty statements on all levels
of comedy. This is a role for which
every actress would surely give her
false eyelashes. But the author can
only do so much. The rest was done
by Doris Hagen on the boards of
Page Hall. She was perfect! Every
line was drained of its last drip of
comedy by Doris Her gestures. vo-
cal inflections. physical movement
and everything were perfect. She
looked like Olive from head to toe,
and that was very pleasing! If I
tell you that roses smell. I hope you
won‘t ask me why. but Doris surely
deserves dozens.

Harry Warr's comedy had much
to achieve in order to hold the audi-
ence after the first play. but it. too.
provided satisfying performances.
Technically, this play was difficult
to produce since there was so much
complicated movement involved in
the large cast and frantic nio-
tioii required. However, things ran
smoothly, or rather, as unsmoothiy

Veteran Society
To Meet Today

The Vcteraiis' Society will hold
a meeting todiiy at 12:35 pm. in
Richardson 20. announces Robert
Jennings ‘56. Secretary of the So-
ciety. Jennings also reported that
the Society members attended a

as was required by the delightful
script. The many roles in the play

were handled well by the actors. 

and each captured the comic effect
of his role. Arlene Yanks was ex-
cellent in her flattery portrayal of
an amateur group’s director. Her
movement was perfected and her
facial expressions added much to
the overall exaggeration of her
satiric character. Nancy Lighthall
gave a really fine performance as
the prompter. Bustling around. al-
ways busy doing nothing, she was
truly comic. This performance was
an excellent example of “staying in
character," for at no time did she
lapse from her portrayal—even down
to talking to herself! Richard Beau-
diii developed an interesting char-
acter through the use of his voice,
as did Bill Wilcox. Ed Jones did
a well-executed slapstick fail. and
Marilyn Ertet‘, Richard Feldman,
Betty Van Vleck, and James 'l‘iiompe.
son gave the most to their parts.
Jane Shaw's delivery of the curtain
line provided a fitting close to this
play in that it was well-done.

Mr. Warr’s play suffered some-
what in that it achieved a very high
pitch early in the production and
continued on this level throughout.
This constancy might have become
tiresome and difficult to endure. but
the lines surely demanded a bedlam
effect, and this was accomplished.

Present Plays
Starling Friday

Two productions centered about
religion will be enacted before au-
diences at the Union College Thea-
ter by a troupe of student Thes-
pians who are collectively called.
in theatrical circles. the Mounte-
banks.

The initial performance will be
on March 18 at 8:30 p.m.. with the
showing of the duet. The Second
Shepherd's Play and Everyman.
Successive performances will be on
March 19. 20, 25. 26. and 27.

The tickets, priced at $1.50. have
been available at the Union Thea-
ter box office since Wednesday.
Phone orders will be accepted from
i to 9 pm. The number is Sche-
nectady 7-7622. In order to take
advantage of reduced rates. the
theater announces that a block of
ten seats can be bought for $12.50.
This is a saving of $.25 a seat.

Everyman, like The Second Shep-
herd’s Play, is a medieval play.
The former is one with a theme
of simple quiet faith. It has been
recently revised by Albert Johnson,
head of the drama at the Red-
liinds, California. The Second Shep.
lierd's Play is a mystery play. in
that it reveals some of the mys-
teries of the Bible. It is a fast-
steppiiig comedy about a rollicking
shepherd who. oddly enough. robs
sheep!

Those izppei‘classmen who were
here during the past year remem-
bcr it performance of Everyman in
January. 1953, starring John Orser.
under Dr. Pettit's direction. and
with the Elementary Dramatics
