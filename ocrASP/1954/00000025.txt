Day Of Decision . .  2

Today’s assembly should see a final vote
on the proposed constitutional amendment
which should reVISe our entire system OI
student government. The issue has been
beIore you long enough: assemblies have
been filled With it, so has the News, so have
many committee meetings on and on the
record. 'l'he issues have been debated, tus—
cussed, augmented and argued Since Janu-
ary. 'l'ociay is the day ior deCiswe aetion.

‘l'he uovernmeht rteViSion Committee
held a l‘neetmg Wednesclay night in order
to discuss the manner Oi presentation 01
the amendment to b‘A toaay. What Struck
us lllOSL snarpiy about the meeting was the
predominant peSSimism of the members
concerning the acceptance of the amend-
ment by DA. During and alter the meet—
ing, oniy one committee member expressed
any laitn in the new plan's being superior
to our present system. .

’l‘ne amendment Will be presented article
by artwie, a two-thirds vote being necessary
to pass each article. Then the amendment
Will be v0ted on as a whole. 'l'he discussmn
Will begin With Article V, the Legisiature.
Therein lies the whole crux of the i'eViSion.
‘l‘ne committee expressed the view of taking
the vote on Article V as a general indication
of the acceptance or i'(‘)l‘l'tl()ll by 5A oi the
entire plan. ’l'hc principles of representa—
tive government as the committee has
chosen to cieiine it are iound in this article.
A mm for Article V is a vote to overrule
democracy in lavor of partial representa-
tion. A vote ior Article V will take all
lutul'C votes of out the hand of you student-
taxpayers.

'ine only argument in favor of the re-
vision that seems to carry any weight is
that our school is outgrowmg a ‘l‘own Meet-
ing iorm oi government. 'l‘iiis is a lallacy.
Not only has this government operated ef-
licientiy in the past icw years when the.
enrollment was Just slightly less than it
is today, but the basic principles oi the
Town Meeting system bear out the fact that
it can operate Just as eliic'iently in a school
much larger than ours. The very nature
oi our school and the iiiiilted facilities
available to it Will prevent our student body
irom enlarging to such an extent as to
oeciii our present system not leasible.

The basic principle oi the proposed sys-
tem is that ol i'ci)i'csentation ill government
instead of direct vote by SA. We lccl that
this particular amendment. fails to define a
truly representative legislature. liven ii We
thought rcpri-scntativc government would
l)(.‘Il(‘llL the school, we certainly would not
accch it in such a spineless lorni. At least
in the U. S. government We know which
licprcscntatives to praise, i'i‘ill('th‘, and
hold responsible ior rclicciing; our vote;
in the proposed plan \\i' would have our
choice oi thnty or thirty. as the case may
be. Will this iiiiikc ior clllcicncy in pov-
criniicnt'.‘

Although llil‘ l‘lllii'i‘ plan may not. come
to a vote today. Article \2' should. A nega-
tive vole for this article may prescrvc a
most democratic uovcrninciit wliosc virtues
are being; neglected and abused.
