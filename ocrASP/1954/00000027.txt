Strictly
For The Birds

Life in the Library Friday
was for the birds. A member
of the homing-corps managed
to invade the serenity of the
study area.

The pudgy pigeon circled
above the cautious inhabitants
of Cobb's Corners, landing peri-
odically on chandeliers and
window sills.

Two janitors and a librarian
started a. lacrosse game. One
wielded a long pole for a bat
to keep our active ave on first
base. while George galloped the
last mile home with a butterfly
net, confiscated from Dr. Wall's
bugs and butterfly supply.

As Homer flew from the East
to West ends and back again.
the scholarly spectators resem-
bled an Abbott and Costello
version of a tennis match.

The bird finaly flew the coop
via a leftover louver.
