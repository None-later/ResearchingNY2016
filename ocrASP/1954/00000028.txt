A Sensible Solution . . .

For several years, organizations such as
Music Council and Dramatics and Arts
Council who depend upon paid admissions
to events they sponsor in order to keep out
of the red have been looking for a way to
enforce the fact that Student Tax cards
are not transferable. These organizations

have lost money in past years because mem-’

bers of SA have allowed outsiders to borrow
their cards in order to attend events here
at State without paying the outside ad-
mission fee.

In the beginning of the year, these or-
ganizations decided to refuse admission to
those who did not have their tax cards to
present along with their admission tickets.
Then the procedure was extended to in-
clude a comparison of the signature of the
individual using the card With the signa-
ture on the card. This system didn’t ex-
actly strike us as being the best thing for
public relations romotion. Then, too, the
problem of wha sort of penalty to mete

out to offenders was discussed. Confiscau

tion of the ticket was decided upon as the
solution. The ticket could be redeemed if
the offender paid the admission rice of
the event for which the card was illegally
used. This system will be in effect for the
Dublin Players and from all ap earances,
for such events for the remain er of this
semester.

Wednesday night, a very sensible and
practical solution was presented before Stu-
dent Council. It consists of a new style tax
card, reproduced on this page. The card
would show a picture of its owner along
with his signature. It would be used for
all four years of his college career. This
system is now used successfully by many
other schools.

The initial expense of converting to this
system would be approximately $1100,
which includes cards for the entire student
body. For each succeeding year, however,
the cost would be reduced to about $300
depending upon the enrollment of new
freshmen, because only freshmen would be
receiving a card. Although we doubt very
much if the money lost by organizations
through card transfers even approaches
$300, this proposed system offers a very
logical solution to the ethical problem in—
volved. This card can also serve as a con-
venient form of identification and proof of
age for those of us without draft cards.

Nominations . . .

Today in Assembly, nominations will be
made for next year's SA officers. We don’t
have to remind you of the importance of
selecting competent individuals to be your
leaders for next year. A bit of reflective
thinking before nominating, and some seri-
ous thought before casting your ballot may
mean the difference between efficiency and
confusion next year.

Being a transfer I haven’t seen
the present form of government in
its “better years” but judging by
last semester it would seem that
something should be done.

I’m not an advocate of change for
change’s sake. although some people
do feel that anything Would be
preferable to the present govern-
ment.

I‘ve watched the students read
their newspapers, watched them do
their homework. and have seen
them in the Commons when it was
known that attendance would not
be taken, Surely this is not an
example of an alert, interested stu-
dent body.

Aithough most people will admit
to an apathetic student association,
there are some idealists who favor
non-compulsory assemblies. Th is
idea might very well lead to chaos.
The Government Revision Commit-
tee. after a good deal of research,
decided that simply non-compulsory
assemblies would be impractical. A
quorum would have to be set and
the student body might or might
not show Lip. Under this plan not
much business could be accom-
plished. There is no proof that
under a non-compulsory form of
government the indifference shown
at present would decrease, or that

By MARILYN SPEGELE

there would suddenly appear a wild-
ly enthusiastic student body.

I've seen representative govern-
ment in action and know it can
be democratic although some people
claim otherwise. An indirect de-
mocracy does not. necessarily lessen
school spirit.

If the representatives are held
responsible to the members of each
class, then there is no valid reason
for an uninformed electorate. The
activity, and responsibility of each
of the classes will be greater since
the representatives will report back
to their class and bring suggestions
to the legislature.

With the strengthening of the
classes, there will be many oppor-
tunities for an increase in the entire
college‘s school spirit. Inter-class
rivalry. dances. and parties can be
fun if a larger percentage of the
students turn out for them. It is
my contention that when competing
with a smaller group more people
will become interested in campus
activities.

Rather than see the student body
become. more apathetic under a gov-
ernment that seems to be to their
disliking. I feel that a representa-
tive form of government would be
more conducive to democracy.

PUBLICITY THEFTS

Some people around here work pretty hard trying
to publicize activities and it seems rather small that
their efforts should be torn off the walls as souvenirs
or merely as a good joke. If you‘re not interested
in what’s going on. leave the posters for someone
else to look at. There are some of us who like to keep
up with events. and checking publicity is a good
way to do so.

SENIORS!

Looks as though the big day is really coming. The
Co-op is ready and eager to take orders for the rental
of caps and gowns for MUD and June 13. Get a
buddy to measure your cranium and order your re-
galia. as soon as possible. Look Ma, I'm graduatin'.

MYSKANIA

As is the usual procedure. Myskania has presented
Student Association with its recommendations and
suggestions for next year’s judicial body. We can‘t
help feeling that some fine juniors were overlooked
in this selection. However, Myskania does not claim
infallibility, and Student Association has a chance
to proclaim its choices in nominations in Assembly.
Look the lists over thoughtfully, and if you feel that
there are juniors who could better qualify for State's
highest honor. nominate them. It is an honor to
be elected, but there is a good deal of brainwork
involved in Myskania’s business, so keep in mind
the abilities of your candidates.

ALL COLLEGE SKIT

We're finally going to have an All College show
and. judging by the number of names on the sign—
up sheet in lower Huested. it should be a smash hit.
Remember that try-outs will be held Tuesday after-
noon, so if you sing, dance, act or just. want to have
fun. drop in on the big test!

YAWN DANCE

Comes the dawn tomorrow and State's students will
be dancing with shining morning faces in Brubacher's
game room. If We retire early. say about midnight.
and get up about four and jump into our jeans. we
can rush right over, start dancing and. who knows.
by six we might have our eyes open. See you there . . .

 

By the way. we hear that the administration is
afraid that the dance might lead to raucous or other-
wise unseeinly behavior on the part of those attend—
ing. Such fears do not reflect well on the student
body. and we sincerely hope that they will be proven
to be unjustified. It‘s never too late. to grow up.
so let‘s demonstrate that we have.

MUG SIIOTS

This week, Student Coiincii approved the idea of
having identification photographs on the student. tax
cards next year. and the motion will probably be
presented to Student Association at a special assembly
next week. Considering the number of uses to which
the picture could be put. this seems like a good move
And just think of the thrill of seeing your own smiling
pliysiogiiomy every time you open your wallet. In
spite of that it still seems like a good idea.

CLEAN UP

We hear that a clean—up bee has been suggested
to clean up our Student Union in time. to prescnt a
gleaming facade to visiting parents on Moving Up
Day. Frankly. Wi‘ hadn‘t noticed that the Union was
so dirty. but. possibly the months of becoming ac-
customed to the piles of trash in the Commons have
dulled our sensibilities. Anyway, it would bchoove
us all to be prepared to do n little [1111]) wielding
before the big day.

ln Sectionals

On Saturday, April 3, the State
College Wrestling Club will take
part in the Eastern Sectionals of
the Adirondack AAU at the Troy
YMCA.

The weighing-in time for this
wrestling meet will be at 10:30 on
Saturday, with the matches com-
mencing at 12:30 and culminating
in the early evening. This sectional
tourney promises to exhibit some of
the best thoroughbred college
wrestling flesh in this district.

The Garciamen will. as usual. be
sparked by the stellar performances
of the consistently fine wrestling of
“Raymie” Wolfe and stalwart Ben
Button.

“Rebel” Hockmuth will be State’s
lightest entry, expected to weigh in
at 123 pounds, and Eagan will be
the big boy, wrestling in the unlim-
ited weight class.

State‘s wrestlers’ unofficial weight
will be:

Table Tennis Match
Pits Chernoff-Derwin

Rolling towards what promises to
be a knock-down, drag-out finale,
the MAA ping-pong tourney will
pit Chuckles Chernoff against
Chuck Derwin in the best singles
match of the week. The winner of
this match will probably be one of
the favorites to cop the singles
crown.

The feature attraction in doubles
play. which has reached the quarter-
finals, will be the teum of Decker
and Derwin against the strong duo
of Smith and Jacobson. The cur-
rent favorites for title contention
is the Berlcth-Miller powerhouse,
which has thus far vanquished all
comers rather handily.

Readers will notice that in one
bowling story of this issue five men,
supposedly representing State. had
to be referred to as an “independ-
ent” group. This phrasing has
come about as a result of both MAA
and AA board officials’ action deny-
ing this aggregation the right to
use State’s name in intercollegiate
bowling matches and of financing
any matches.

The keglers, somewhat irked over
the refusal to grant such a small
and insignificant sum. nevertheless
had enough spirit and interest to
finance their own trips. Yet the
officials denied the use of State’s
name. Why? Did they feel the
group was in some way degrading
any of State's prestige in sports?
The group has gone through the
season undefeated and, as a climax,
has captured the Delhi Tech Tour-
nament Trophy. Is this degrading?
This group in turn has been asked
to sponsor next year's tourney.
Should this group refuse because
of lack of support and thereby
create 111 will among the several
colleges with which it has helped
to build up better relations?

It seems unwise to tie the hands
of these eager men who are willing
to act as State’s ambassadors of
good will, even at their own expense
and time.

The group itself, now curtailing
its unbeaten season because of these
obstacles, has but one question left
in their minds: “Where should the
trophy (won in State’s name and
publicized otherwise) stand?"

Kegiers Capture

Tourney. Trophy

Middle Game Gives
independent Group Cup
in Delhi Tech Tourney

An independent group of State
College bowlers came home carry-
ing a trophy Saturday noon after
a successful venture in a six-school
tourney at Delhi.

The keglers, unaccustomed to 10
am. bowling, were off to a slow
start as they split the maples for
a 771 in the opener. In the second
game, the group came up with a
splendid 9'77. John Zidik came up
with a 222 game, being deprived of
the tourney's high single trophy by
getting a split in the final frame,
after six straight strikes. The
team came up with an 817 for a
three-game tally of 2565. This was
61 pins more than the runner-up
school was able to hit.
