Enrollment Data

The total enrollment for the
Spring Semester, 1954 has been re-
ported by Philip A. Cowen, Research
Coordinator in the State University
of New York.

Out of the totar full-time, ori-
cainpus students, which number
20.025, Albany State College has
1,556. This is rated second in num-
ber only to Buffalo State Teachers'
College, with 1,905.

The breakdown for the enrollment
of Albany's total is 1,402 under-
graduate. matriculated, students and
145 graduate matriculated. In the
non-matriculated category, there are
4 undergraduate and 5 graduate
students.

Albany State has more graduate
students enrolled than any other
Teachers' college in the state. With
the expected increase in the fresh-
man class of ‘58, it is possible that
the Albany Fall semester registra-
tion will number well over 1700.

 

some capacity. Ruben Garcia will
do the choreography for the skit,
and anyone interested in learning
how to dance is welcome to try out.
You need not be experienced since
J. Ruben will instruct participants
in the necessary steps. This is an
opportunity in itself! I have heard
that great plans are in store in the
scenery line, so people interested
in stage crew will be welcomed.
And, don't forget, hours will be
given toward D&A Affiliate mem-
bership for participation in any of
these activities.

Rehearsals for Tovarich are com-
ing along well. This play presents
a difficulty in that several mem-
bers of the cast are required to have
Russian accents. However, through
perseverance and skillful direction,
this hurdle has been overcome by
the actors.

One interesting sidelighi stemming
from the play revolves about a
scene which requires a duel to be
enacted by Don Duclos and Art
Lennig. In preparation for the scene,
bliss Grenander is instructing the
actors in the art of fencing. Did
you know that the crusader for
Henry James is an expert at this

sport? She has participated in
various national competitions and

was a member 01' the Olympic squad.
This may explain the shouts of “on

guard" that have been echoing
through Page Hall as 01' late.
Congratulations to the Foreign

Film Group for their fine film, Emil
and the Detective, and to the Al-
bany High Drumntics Association

Formals To Highlight Weekend

For Brubacher, Pierce, Potter

 

"Don't Fence

Us In”

One rather weak AI’A man
has been awarded the Oscar
of the week. While in Albany
Hospital with diphtheria, his
brothers are quiesccntly raising
the roof over iheir quarantine.

To pass the time of day,
while regretfully missing all
their classes. the AI’A men can
be seen developing their bad-
minion and volleyball muscles
on tire lawn overlooking Madi-
son Ave. Still others are de-
veloping their bridge and poker
skill over a bottle of brew.

Every morning as the healthy
scholars skip to school. envious
eyes fall upon the closed blinds
and thoughts turn to drowsing
shut-ins.

Speculation and rumors are
spreading further than the
plighi. A few other houses on
campus are putting in extra
provisions "just in case"!
