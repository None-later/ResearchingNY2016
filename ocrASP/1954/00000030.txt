No Contest . . .

In the depths of our memory it seems we
remember Moving-Up Day as being a day
of surprises, pleasant and otherwise, when
the election results were announced. We
also seem to remember having more than
one candidate to choose from on our bal-
lots. But of course those were also the days
when people came to assemblies and enjoy-
ed them and everybody and his brother
took part in the Friday debates.

We remember, too, when Myskania would
recommend to fill their own shoes some SA
members who had shown an avid interest
in student activities, and would abstain
from makin any recommendations when
no such can idates were available. But then
those were the days when the performance
in a particular position was considered more
seriously than simply the listin of said po—
sition on an activ1ty sheet, an when said
positions were actually held and fulfilled by
their claimants.

It was observed earlier this year by one
of our classmates that all most of us have
done this year is reminisce about preceding
years. Reflective thought has value, but it
is decisive action that runs any group effi-
ciently. Let us reflect upon the past but
take decisive action when we are presented
with our multicolored ballots at our next
assembly. Today you will hear the platforms
of major candidates and be introduced to
the others. Let’s not allow quantity of ex-
perience outweigh quality of performance
in our final decisions.

Parliamentary Procedure . .

Last week in Assembly the major points
of the amendment presented by the Govern-
ment Revision Committee were defeated by
a significant vote from SA. In these days
when time is a scarce commodity, no one
wants to spend his valuable time working
for a losing cause. As long as the motion
passed quite some time ago that would dis-
continue compulsory assemblies when a
suitable form of government is adopted is
hanging over our heads, the Government
Revision Committee must continue working
toward such a suitable plan. Since the vote
on the motion that passed it was so close,
and since the representative plan presented
last week was defeated, our student govern-
ment leaders would like to see if the tide of
SA opinion has turned back to favoring
compulsory assemblies. Therefore, a motion
will be made for SA to rescind the original
motion that started all this fuss. A two-
thirds vote will be necessary to strike the
motion from the books.

We would like to see compulsory assem-
blies re-established on a firm ground. We
would like to see next year’s leaders take
over without this unfinished business hin-
dering their progress toward a more active,
spirited, optimistic student government.

Ideals . . . do you subject yourself
sometimes to a personal inspection?
A sort of inventory of your actions,
thoughts and ideals. One's ideals

dwindle away rather rapidly during
the process of growing up. And how
could they possibly survive under
the close scrutiny with which we
approach life. There are many of
us, who look at life through power-
ful lenses, in fact these lenses may
be even stained with some gray, so
that we shall not imagine some rose-
colored aspect in life. After all, we
must be scientific, objective, cool
in our actions, only then do we lead
an lrreproachable life, worthy of
the human mind.

Oh fools that we are! How can
we understand the rhythm of life
if we never experienced it? How
dare we speak about the whole,
while we know only the parts? Take
the petal of a rose. A deep red hue
relaxes your eye, and your hand
thrills to the velvet texture of this
fragrant piece of life. Yet, can you
delight in the real. mature splen-
dor of a fully-blossomed rose by
merely knowing its petal? Of course
not, you say. But at the same mo-
ment you dissect the petal. You wish
to know the rose further still. One
must place it under a microscope.
An ugly brown mass, marked with
horny bulges, separated by frizzled
scars stares at you now. Is this a
Rose?

Man what have you done? The
picture which once delighted your
heart, in your hands became a
nightmare. Perhaps this accusation
suggests a schizophrenic mind, flee-
ing reality. But I ask, is this real-

By ASPASIA

ity. what we see under the micro-
scope? No we just exchanged a
beautiful image for an ugly one.
Life is a serious subject. True! But
does seriousness imply harshness?
Yet, disillusionment, you tell me, is
necessary and unavoidable for the
process of growing up in our world.
After all, we cannot go through life,
believing in Good Fairies and Prince
Charmings.

Who said we cannot? Perhaps not
with the fancy imagery and the
vivid pictures of a child's world, yet
a smaller degree of phantasy does
not imply its non-existence. The
happy pictures of our childhood
should ripen to realistic ideals in
our adulthood. That adjective “re-
alistic” is of great importance. Ideals
which lie outside of the farthest
realm of human possibility will not
serve their function as ideals. Ideals
must give an ascending direction in
our lives, they must be a spring of
refreshing power in our course of
life. Thus, if an ideal lies beyond
the hope of being attainable to some
degree, the purpose of the ideal is
defeated. In fact, such ideals will
become a blazing meteor, blind man
and cast him into an abyss of des-
pair. Ideals have the function to be
constructive. In their essence they
will be unattainable, but in degrees
man must be able to approach them.
Then ideals will be a truly uplift-
ing power. And this is precisely why
man holds them dear. So let us
choose our ideals carefully and with
prudence, but once established do
not slander your own altar to please
the multitude.

WE'RE ALL FOR

. . . the coming vacation. It's really just about time,
don‘t you think? Perhaps a week back home will lift
the clouds of depression and pessimism which seem
to have settled over the heads of most of us. A new
tie or flowered bonnet might perk us up enough to
come back to face the few remaining weeks of school
with a little hope for the future.

. . . SA’s decision on the proposed change in govern-
ment. It's encouraging to note that State's students
care enough about their legislative powers to vote
against losing them. Now if only we can get up inter-
est in the exercising of these powers by more than
a handful of students each week. our government
might work the way it was designed to.

. . . the display of paper-backed books in the 00-01).
There are some fine selections there now, and if the
volume of sales should warrant it we wouldn’t be sur-
prised if the number and choice of volumes should
increase to the point where we could build our reprint
libraries from Co-op selections.

. . . the fine response to the Dawn Dance. It was a
great party and a good time was had by all the hop-
pers present. Cheers for those who came up with the
idea. and carried it tln-ough.

. . . the comments made by the Dublin Players on
the high quality of audience response to their two
plays, presented last Monday. They felt that the in-
telligence of our audience added a great deal to the
success of their performances, particularly to that of
the religious play presented in the evening. This type
of play demands a sympathetic audience or it loses
all of its significance, and evidently the actors felt
this kind of response, for the play was excellent. It's
good to hear a sincere compliment to the State Col-
lege audience after the repeated slams it has received
in the past.

AND WE'RE AGAINST

. those people who are making it difficult for
Campus Commission by smoking in Richardson halls
and refusing to comply when asked to stop. Enforc-
ing rules is a thankless task at the best of times, and
it seems unnecessarily petty to make the job more
unpleasant by refusing to cooperate. This rules ap-
plies to everyone in Richardson, even the grad stu—
dents.

. . . the sad plight of the boys in the APA house.
As a result of the big quarantine sign on their door.
they are forced to put up with their own all-male
company until the end of the week. However, from
all reports, the boys are doing an excellent job of
fighting boredom. We congratulate them on their
struggle for happiness in the face of adversity, and
sincerely trust that nobody suffers any worse sick-
ness than the pain of an enforced holiday. Did you
ever notice how these things always crop up just
before vacation? There is positively no justice.

. . , the old custom of electing Student Association
officers on the basis of popularity rather than ability.
Remember that each office is more functional than
honorary. This applies to Myskania, which organiza-
tion has to contribute a great deal of clear thinking
if the government is to function as it should. When
voting this tilne, be sure you have a clear idea of
what the duties and abilities are required in each post.
then decide who of those running could best meet
the requirements. This is the simple rule for sensible
voting that everyone knows but few follow.

. . the necessity of going to clues and pounding
the books now that Spring is here. There is some-
thing about the total effect of robins, warm blue skies,
and trees in early leaf that produces a deadly leth-
argy. You start out on a chapter, a term paper, or
a News column, full of determination to do a thor-
ough job. when you glance out a window, your
thoughts begin to drift away, and pretty soon . . .

STATI COLLIOI NIWB. FRIDAY. APRIL 9. 1934

PAC. .

 

3M 5% 71m

By McEVOY and SWIERZOWSKI

With a between seasons sports lag
presently noticed by lack of news
tips for this page, we of the staff
are taking advantage of the situa-
tion to open up a few questions in
the minds of our readers concern-
lng a few items of the present
sports topics.

Of probable interest to almost
any State student is the quotation
from the February 15, 1935 State
College NeWs: “Now that we have
a real basketball team, why don’t
we play some college teams? Drew——
bah!!! Connecticut State—phoney."
Further on in that article we no-
ticed, “State plays host to MIT to-
morrow on the Page court."

To clarify that quotation, we
checked previous hoop schedules to
see what competition had been
like. In 1928 the chart included:
St. Michael's, Coast Guard, St.
Bonaventure, CCNY, Norwich, Coop-
er Union, LIU and others. How
much does the situation parallel
ours today? A few weeks ago the
State hoopsters ended a successful
season and indications were that
they would have been able to hold
their own in much greater compe-
tition. The way this staff sees it,
the hoopsters deserved a better
schedule than the one offered.

While observing the amateur ath~
ietes in vigorous sports competition
on Dorm Field for the past few
afternoons, we think there is suf-
ficient high school truck experience
in many of these enthusiasts. With
the combination of the enthusiasm
and a small sum of money, we see
no reason why State could not in-
augurate just such a program.

We also noticed in our investi-
gation that initiation of crOSs—
country came to State in 1935. In
recent years instigations have been
heard for a revival of this sport.

Another topic of much discus-
sion is the question of the calibre
of State's gym. Rumors have been
heard that there is some desire
on the part of the State Athletic
Department for the purchase of a
portable basketball floor for use in
State games at New Scotland Ave-
nue Armory. The question pops up,
however, “Would enough fans sup-
port the team if this ‘dream floor'
of the Athletic Department became
a reality?" Also, is the present
grade of competition enough of a
drawing card?

In conclusion, a few more ques-
tions. Is it lack of interest? Is it
lack of money? The Sports Rela-
tions Board, in the midst of an ex-
tensive program to promote the
present sports program at State,
could do a much more efficient
job if our sports were of a high
college calibre. Good sports and
good promotions would do a lot. we
feel. Why the situation is as it is,
we don’t know. It is our sincere pur-
pose in writing this column to bring
about such suggestions and opinions
on the athletic program.

Squad To Start
Spring Practice

With State’s first baseball game
of the season but three weeks in
the offing, routine practice and
conditioning sessions marked the
week's activity for that sport.

The Hathawaymen engaged in
their first outdoor practice on
Wednesday afternoon at Beverwka
Field. Although the squad per-
formed surprisingly well at this
session, because of the earliness of
the drill a fair indication of the
squad's prospects cannot be ascer-
tained.

It was learned this week that
Bob Dreher, catcher on last sea-
son's nine, will be sidelined for the
entire 1954 season because of an
arm injury. Presently catching the
slants of the group’s array of pitch-
ers is Sophomore Sig Smith. Smith,
in his first year of State baseball,
has been performing very well be-
hind the plate and is expected to
hold the position during the season.

MAA And AA
Plan Award Banquet

State's Varsity letter winners and
1M award winners will be the
guests of honor at the athletic
award banquet which is now being
planned for the final week in May.
The bouquet is to be jointly spon-
sored by MAA and AA, with Fran
Rodgers and Custer Quick heading
the arrangements.

The feature speaker at the fete
is slated to be a well-known pro-
fessional basketball player. Bob
Davies of the Rochester Royals
and former Seton Hall ace, has been
the proposed speaker.

Each Varsity letter winner will
receive a Varsity sweater this year
as the athletic award.

Wrestling Club Participates ln Tournament;
Team Concludes Season With 5-1 Record

The State College Wrestling Club

competed in its first post-season
tournament last Saturday, the East-
ern Section of the Adirondack
AAU Tournament held in the Troy
YMCA. Tourney director was Boris
Kazimiroms, Physical Director at
the Troy Y.

This tournament was won by the
Norwich Y with 29 points, followed
by the Rome Y with 17 points, Col-
gate Wrestling Club with 15, Troy
Y with 5, Schenectady Y with 5,
and Albany State with 3 points.
Ben Button was the only State
grappler to reach the finals, get-

tTng pinned by Blume in 4:53. but
earning the lone 3 points for the
squad.

There were 82 competitors in this
year's tournament, over three times
as many entries as last year. Two
mats were in operation during the
entire tournament, with referees Joe
Garcia of State, Bob Olcott of Al-
bany Academy and Forbes Brown of
the Schenectady Y officiating.

The Wrestling Club ended its
regular season with an excellent
5 and 1 record. On the basis of this
showing, the Club hopes to achieve
Varsity status next year.

Phi Delta regained its winning
form on Tuesday as the Phi Delt
team downed Beta Zeta in the fi-
nal two-game rolloff to take the
league championship. As the two
teams entered the last two games
of the six-game series, both had 3
points of the necessary 5 needed to
take the championship. A point
was given for each game won and
another point for the team having
the highest total pins each day.

In the first game, BZ lost 604 to
640, a 36-pin margi'n. High single
for BZ was turned In by Nicky
Loehr, who had a 144. She was
followed by Phyllis Parshall's 121.
