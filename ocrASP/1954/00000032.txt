News Within The News. ..

Tuesday evening the News board ap-
proved a change in the State College News
constitution that will be a radical innovae
tion from our traditional system. The gist
of the amendment is that News board elec-
tions with the exception of sports staff will
be held in January instead of May, when
most of the organizations on campus elect
their new officers. This change has been
discussed for quite a few years, and we wel-
come it with the hope that it will aid in
improving the quality of our staff and the
quality of our paper.

The new editors will be selected from the
Juniors on the News staff and will serve in
their new capacities second semester of
their Junior year and first semester of their
Senior year. After having had first-hand
experience, we feel that practice teaching
and running a newspaper are not very com-
patible. This new system will leave our
editors with second semester of their Senior
year free from any responsibility to News
so they may pursue the more important
issue of earning a degree. It will also al-
leviate the confused condition of the PO.
and its occupants in September when a new
staff takes over, tries to organize itself, and
publish a paper every Friday along with
all the other confusion that occurs when
classes recommence.

We feel that this amendment will prove
to be very beneficial to our organization
and the school as a whole. We would like
to see tradition sacrificed for the sake of
efficiency in Student Association elections
as well. The beginning of second semester
has always been a dull spot on our social
calendar; May will always be cluttered with
activities. From our exchange papers we
note that many other colleges already hold
January elections and many more are try-
ing to initiate the practice. This policy
might prove to be the “shot in the arm”
that will do more for enlivening SA than
representative government ever could be.
Take note, please, Government Revision
Committee.

Subtle Hints . . .

By far the cleverest and most successful
campaign undertaken by Campus Commis-
sion this year is the “No Smoking in the
Halls” drive that has caught the attention
of almost everyone who travels from the
Commons to Richardson. In place of the
usual uninspired notices such as those in
railroad stations and dynamite plants, CC
has substituted witty but forceful sugges-
tions on small cards in no-smoking areas.
All reports attest to the success of this plan
and the disappearance of offending tobacco
fiends from the halls and stairways. We
think the commission deserves a bouquet
(or at least a carton of their favorite brand)
for solving such a distasteful job in such a
subtle and effective way. Thanks too to
SA for cooperating with a smile.

FRIDAY. APRIL 30. 1954

 

Hi YA HAND$OMEX

 

ﬂeeideuﬁd plat/Mind

CHARLES BECKWITH

I offer as my platform the fol-
lowing points: Student Government
has been in a rather confused state
this year. I personally feel that
compulsory attendance at assemblies
is the best plan for us to follow.
We. as future teachers and leaders,
should feel it our obligation to have
a working knowledge of student
government and the best way to
gain this knowledge is to actively
participate in our government here
at State. With a minimum amount
of planning involved. I feel assured
that a completely fair system of at-
tendance at compulsory assemblies
could be established.

However. if you, Student Associa-
tion, indicate the desire for repre-
sentative government, I shall do all
I can to work with you. If such a
plan were adopted. I would try to
keep all channels of communication
open to the entire student body so
that everyone could follow and be
aware of everything that is goiilg
on in the government.

Secondly, student interest at State
needs rejuvenation!!! This is evi-
denced by the lack of interest shown
in a large scale All-College Revue
as was originally planned. It is
my hope that such a Revue will take
place next year.

The lack of interest has also been
shown by the fact that there are
entirely too many people who are
willing to decline nomination for
office. I feel that ii workable plan
cotild be established to enforce the
need for competition in all elections.

A renewed interest in Student
Council would require its members
to voice their opinions in assemblies
of the aSsociatioii»-—opinions which
they freely offer lll Student Council
meetings.

’I‘hirdly, other colleges have u
very successful program which I
think would be very good to ill-
stitutc here at State. Under this
program. which could be called a
"Library Week." fill classes are sus-
pended for u wcck. Dliriiig this
time, students can devote them-
selves to their library work, such
(is writing term papers, doing out—
sidc reading and other research
projects. 1 should like very much
to work with the collcgc lidiiiinistrii-
tion and faculty ill initiating such
u brogrlim.

Fourthiy, our collcgc nccds much
more ()utsidc piiblicily to iiiltkc it
more well known. One way to giiiil
iavoriiblc publicity for our school
would be by the expansion of our
athletic program. If clcctcd. I shall
do all I cult to lniprch State Col-
lcgc's public relations.

I have been able to spend this
past year in observing. working on
various projects lill(l broiuicnliig my
knowledge of the school and its
activities. I offer my policies and
my experience (is a foundation for
it rejuvenath Student government.
All you need offer are your votes.

JOAN CARLIN

My platform is based on one de-
sire. that of working toward de-
veloping a situation and attitude in
the members of Student Association
which will incite them to have a
working interest in our government
affairs. I feel that there are several
avenues through which we can work
towards this ideal.

I am in favor of government rc-
vision as long as the change made
results in (i better system than that
which we have now. Until that timc
I thliik the present system should
be maintained with one addition:
a better distribution of classes in
the assembly which could be worked
out through the Assembly Seating
Committee.

Also, the asscmblics should be
varied and made more interesting
with a separation of business illlCl
entertainment assemblics.

I feel that the strength of Student
Association depends ()ii how well-
informed the classes arc. This
awareness which would result in
more intelligent discussion in as-
semblies could be stimulated by
frequent reports to the classes by
their Student Council rcprcscnta-
tives of what is going on in Council.

There should be illl iiiiproveincnt
in the publicizing of all open nicct-
ings of all boards or commissions.

A big factor in arousing iiiorc
school spirit is to ciicouriigc strong
support of fill collcgc activitics, ()nc
event that could hc citcd hcrc is
the All-College Rcvuc l ililiik tlic
Director and Co-ordiniitor should
be clioscli in the Spring bcforc tlic

Gammon-3141a

By HOPKINS and COOPER

Scene: A smoke-filled caucus room. Usual meeting
place of Student Council. Today filled with a milling
throng of eager spectators waiting to hear evidence
presented on both sides in the case of Hopkins and
Cooper vs. The World. Chairman Brown opens the
hearing by nervously tapping his gavel and calling
for order.

 

 

Brown: The defendants are charged with exerting
excessive pressures upon Student Association through
their activities with the Common Stater. The first
witness for the defense will come to the stand.

(Hopkins is brought to the stand, obviously shaken
biit attempting to retain her composure while casting
buleful looks at Cooper, her former co-author.)

Brown: Exactly what sort of pressures are you
attempting to exert in your column?

llopkins: Well, you see, we thought it would be a
good idea to get the Seniors out for MUD since it's
their last chance to sing with '54 and they really
should cast off a little of their apathy and come.

(An obscure spectator in the rear rises to his feet,
waving a paper in the air, and demands the attention
of the chair.)

Joe: Point of order. Mr. Chairman. I have in my
hands a photograph of the sing at last year's MUD.
Neither of the defendants appears in this picture.
Obviously. they are guilty of exerting influence towards
participation in a function in which they do not be-
lieve themselves.

Brown: This is a point of order?
Hopkins: This is a photograph?

Joe: This is a perfectly fine photograph. Of course,
we had to cut it a little to make it fit the frame

(The crowd breaks into unrestrained cheers. coni-
mending the wisdom of their representative. Hopkins
is seized by the herd and carried to the dorm field
to meet her fate.)

Brown: The next witness for the defense.

(Cooper comes proudly to the stand, looking neither
to the right nor left. His nervous agitation is only
betrayed by his habit of chewing on his lapel.)

Brown: Mr. Cooper, have you and your cohort at-
tempted to exert any other forms 01' pressure upon
State students?

Cooper: Shucks. we've just been tryin' to get people
to think about their votin' so that they get some good
leaders next year, and we in no way attcmpted to
influence their votes.

Joc: They told people how to vote upon lit least
one occasion. I know they have.

Cooper: We just don't advocate thc overthrow of
(he present form of government.

Brown: That sounds noble.

Joe: That sounds suspicious.
(Murmurs from the crowd.)

Brown: Is it triic that you cxcrted pressure to
obtain a Fulbright Fcllowship for 11 State College
Student so that thc name of NYSCT could be carried
to the streets of Rome and the canals of Vcnicc?

(‘oopcrz Us? Cici ii l'cllowshlp'.’ Ha!

300: All Wc do is to try to (‘llLCl'iillll Lhc pcoplc.
We tell them funny storics like this onc: "I learned
Virtue at my mother‘s kncc biit for vice I had to go
to some other low joint."

(’l‘hc enraged crowd bursts iilto a prolonged roar,
((ishcs to the stand and scivcs Cooper by the throat.
Blown managcs to convincc them that they should
do their busincss clscwhcrc. so ihcy (akc Cooper on!
(o joini his portiicr in crime.)

Brown: This closcs illt‘ procccdings. Caisc (lis~
niisscti.

.ioc: Point of ordci'. Who is The Masked Itider‘.’
