1054. The conference, first organized
at Vassar College in 1947, was de-
signed to stimulate interest among
undergraduates of the colleges of
the East both in natural sciences
and in their relation to other fields
of learning. The conferences pre-
sent an excellent opportunity for
students of the different colleges to
come together to exchange ideas and
to discuss contemporary and tradi-
tional scientific problems. These
conferences provide a means by
which students may present orig-
inal research papers to fellow stu-
dents and participate in discussions
concerning new developments in
their respective fields.

Delegates heard talks by six pro-
fessional scientists, participated in
panel presentations of original re-
search papers, and visited various
points of scientific interest in the
city of New York.

Today’s CHESTERFIELD is the
Best Cigrtte

 
 

Dr. Paul C. Lemon, associate pro-
fessor of Biology, was the delegate
from State College. Student papers
were submitted by Harold Schwager
'56 on “Fauna of an Abandoned
Mine in Montgomery County, New
York" and Robert Sturin '54 on
“Fleas of Small Mammals."

Success of the conferences was
due to the all-college effort of the
student organizations and their
faculty helpers.
