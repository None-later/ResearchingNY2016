ln Retrospect . . .

Tomorrow we will welcome the leaders
that will guide Student A s s o c i a t i o n
through a year that may prove to be a de-
cisive one for student government at State.
Today we are saying farewell to the leaders
- that have served us competently in a year
of transition.

This year’s President and his Student
Council took office in a time of discontent.
In all phases of student activities the cry
was for a change, regardless of in which
direction that change would take us. A
change just for the sake of change was re-
garded by many as the cure for the growing
apathy of the student body as a whole. Our
leaders realized the necessity of trying to
answer that cry, but they also realized that
a more efficient way to revitalize student
activities would be to make us aware of
what we have now.

We have noticed that SA’s interest in its
own activities has been growing steadily in
the past few months. We are ho ing that
this interest and participation wil not re-
ceed between now and next September. It
will be the job of the leaders we meet to-
morrow to catch up this spirit and interest
and help it grow in force and momentum
until the inertia of life can sustain it alone.

Among the achievements of this year’s
SA officers is the growing rapport between
students and faculty at State. We hope
to see the work of the Student-Faculty
committee continue its progress next year.
Also worthy of note is the work done by
this year’s Student Board of Finance, a
group with foresight in the face of a most
difficult job. Praise is also deserved by the
religious clubs on campus, which have
shown a decided spark of progress after a
few years of decellei‘ation. Our yearbook,
too, has enjoyed a year of efficiency and
originality that we hope will be continued
and extended next fall.

On the red-ink side of our ledger we
found almost a complete lack of interest
in the All-College Revue, the show that was
to unite all four classes through working
together. We would very much like to see
a revue next year that succeeds in this pur-
pose and provides good entertainment as
well. The same applies to rivalry, intra-
mural sports, and assembly attendance, to
mention a few things for tomorrow’s lead-
ers to concentrate on.

Last of all we must say farewell to the
News, its board and staff and all those who
cooperated with us to make this a most un—
forgettable year. We find it imposs1ble to
judge ourselves; we realize we have left
many things unsaid and undone. But we
have tried to serve our purpose as the only
organized means of communication in our
college community. We have striven to
lead student opinion, not to be simply its
mirror and record. We feel we have accom-
plished many things within our own organ—
ization; whatever we have done to guide
SA must be judged by you, our readers.

To The Chief

 

EVELYN RUBEN

Dear Evie,

When you turn over your “edi-
torial ruler” tomorrow, you will
leave behind an appreciative staff
and a year of outstanding accom-
plishment. ,

We feel we have been privileged
to serve under you. You have set
up Ruben’s Rules of Journalism for
us to follow. No one can question
the skill you used in handling the
responsibility.

You have kept us laughing as well
as working, combining wit with
ability. We'll miss the jean-clad
clamor from the Editor’s corner and
the Evievessant chuckles in the PD.
when you leave your gang at State
College News.

Best of luck and success in the
future.

Sincerely,
The News Board and
Staff. 1953-1954.

Tomorrow will be a big day for the Juniors, a day
of rejoicing for many and dejection for even more.
At the risk of sounding preachy we'd like to say that
though election results seem pretty important in
May, in September one’s viewpoint changes consid-
erably. Remember that however the elections come
out, we need active Senior members of Student Asso-
ciation next year, as well as good leaders. Good luck
to all of the candidates—the results are anybody’s
guess!

ALL COLLEGE SKIT

Due to the work of a persevering few we will have
a. skit tomorrow night. The struggle to get people out
to rehearsals seems to be quite typical of the general
lack of interest which SA has demonstrated all year.
Large numbers turned out for try-outs. received parts,
and haven't been heard from since. (They all can't
have joined the Air Force!) In spite of the prob-
lems which have faced the directors the show promises
some fine scenes. One of the high points is another
Rank Production which is said to top Tomorrow’s
Creatures, the movie which the Sophomores showed
last year. If you saw that one, you should need no
further encouragement to come to see the skit. How-
ever, it does have some other fine spots, among them
one of the best. ballet scenes ever danced in Page.
Come to see the skit, stay to sing—should be a great
evening!

PICTURE TAX CARDS

Today, in Assembly, you will be asked to consider
the advisability of having identification photographs
on Student Tax cards. This seems the best solution
to the problem which has faced many campus organ-
izations of the transferring of tax cards. The situa—
tion has been thoroughly investigated and the plan
is well worked out. We‘ll go out on a limb, exert a
little more excessive pressure and say, “Vote in favor
of the plan."

lN’I‘ERNATIONAL FILM GROUP

Last night the IFG showed another fine foreign
film production, and plans have been made for two
more to be shown this year. This should show that
the group is not. a momentary flash in thc pan as
many predicted whcn it was organized. bill is here
to stay. The Albany Institute of Htstory and Ari has
shown considerable intcrcsl in the group. which should
bode well for its future.

From The Sidelines

By BOB ASHFIELD

Last weekend when State bowed
to Utica in its first game of the
season, we were on hand and, be-
ing strictly a fan, were impressed by
two of State's ballplayers who
turned in great games.

First of all, John Zidlk, who goes
into the books as the losing pitch-
er. John is in his third year of
Varsity ball and last year he was
quite effective, but pitched in the
shadow of DeComb's “iron-man
feats. The first outing of the year
was enough for John to convince
everyone he definitely “has it." In
the early innings John mowed
down 6 straight men on strikes
and wound up his 7-inning stint
with 9 whiff victims. John, unlike
most pitchers, is one of those “good-
hitting" pitchers and last year even
took over in left field when not
on the mound.

An all-around performer, John
would make a Varsity bowling team
at State look mighty good. We
look for John to have a good year
and to continue improving his
mound talents.

The other name is probably less
familiar to State fans. The only
reason we can think of is because
Leon Ogrodnick is only a fresh-
man. Leon, a little guy at 5’ 8”,
locked mighty “big” around second
base. We were sort of wondering
as to just how good this freshman
was who was taking over Al Can-
on’s old slot. After we saw him
handle his first chance we won-
dered no more, as he made the.
play as easily and as smoothly as
one would want.

Leon gained his experience play-
ing second base in high school at
Ossining and, from the way he
moves around on the diamond.
proves he learned , well. Leon's
diamond talents are not limited to
defense, as he showed good power
at the plate over ilic \vcckeiid.
garnering a couple of hits and chas-
ing the oliti'icldcrs buck to capture
his drives on several other occn-
sions.

Leon's grcat hustlc and ability
will kccp Siaic i'ortificd at second
base for ilic ncxt fcw years.

Nine Drops Opener To Utice;

Fans will be offered their next
chance to watch the Peds perform
tomorrow when the statesmen op-
pose the Potsdam State nine in the
annual Moving-Up Day classic. The
clash, scheduled for 2:30 at Bleeck-

break into the win column.

Since the last issue of the News
the ’54 edition of Fed baseball ini-

the Hathawaymen suffered some

similar. the statesmen ending up
on the short end of a 7-4 New Paltz
tally. The return Utica tussle
Wednesday was along the same
lines, ending in a 9-2 final count.

Although not appearing in the
won column during the week's ac-
tivities, the scores are taken rather
lightly in these early season meet-
ings. As an outstanding conclu-
sion of the frays is the need of
pitching strength imposed by the
Statesmen’s tough and crowded
schedule. To be sure, definite
abundance of talent has displayed
itself on the State roster, as has I.
margin for improvement. The feel-
ing shared by both followers of the
squad and the team itself is that
with an amount of seasoning a
winning State demon aggregation is
to emerge.

Zidlk Twirls Opener

"Opening Day” was the descrip-
tive phrase for last Friday's Utica
tussle. State's loose play and a
dubious amount of Utica mound
strength was seemingly the story.
Albany during the course of events
committed 6 errors while garnering
5 hits, hi comparison to 9 hits and
4 misplays for the Utes. Zidlk be-
gan on the mound for State and
allowed 7 hits in the seven-inning
span. In an attempt to quell the
mounting count, John McCormick
hurled the final two frames, with
two hits. Zidik's pitching was of
a fairly high calibre in all, allow-
ing three free passes and fanning
9. including 6 batters in row.

Shumanski's No-llit Bid Spoiled

The New Paltz contest showed a.
fantastic variance from the score.
Novice Shumanski's hurling was on
the phenomenal side in his 6-inning

 

impeariince. Tom allowed but 2
hits, while maintaining a iio—hit
front for 5 2/3 innings. McCor-

mick’s relief work was fair, show-
ing 3 hits, 3 free passes, and one
cai'iicd run. The hit count was
cven. Statc and New Pnltz each
collecting five. The difference in
tlic game came in the sixth liming
exception with Shumnnski's down-
fall oii walks and hits.

The Uticn return engagement
chncsdny was a iiotiiid story al-
most entirely. The Tangcrines gar-
ncrcd 1'2 hits against 4 blasts for
our heroes, to tell the tale. Doing
the Fed serving were Shuinanski
and Zidlk. A Uticuii by the name
of Papnrcllii employed by the col-
lege for ccnterficld made few Al-

bany friends while netting a cir-
cuit clout and two other lifts.
Chris Bogaiges topped the Feds

with two hits for four trips to the
Utica plate.

In the three-game outing, in all,
Bobaigcs, State first sucker, racked
up 4 hits in ii tries and fielder Lah
collected 2 clouts in 9 attempts.
