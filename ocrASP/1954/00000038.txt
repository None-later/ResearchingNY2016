How the
stars
got started

 

Red Barber says: "I was a
student working my way
through the University of
Florida when I was asked to
be substitute announcer on a
farm program. That got me
a job. In two years, I be-
came chief announcer. My
break in sports came in '34
when I broadcast Cincinnati
Reds games. Been doing
Major League play-by-play
eVer since!"
