PACI 8

Sowing Seeds

A contest is currently running—shall the
final word for the year be “revision” or
“interest”? Both words have appeared reg-
ularl in news articles, columns, and edi-
toria s of this publication. We feel the for-
mer has been sufficiently discussed, and
placed in its pro er perspective; the latter
deserves elaborat on. The “lack of interest”
expression came into limelight this year as
a result of the exceptionally low ebb in
assembly attendance. More students evid-
enced their dislike for compulsory assem-
blies than before, in their flat refusal to at-
tend. But it serves no purpose at present to
reprimand the student body for not attend-
ing, but we strongly urge that such imma-
turity and sense of irresponsibility not be
displayed come next fall.

We feel that the student body can look
with optimistic confidence to the recently
activated Student - Faculty Committee,
which was originally initiated by the ad-
ministration. Current faculty interest and
cooperation merits commendation. The
forthcoming Leadership Conference looks
promising. The utopian aim of channeling
all college activities in one direction —to-
ward promotion of common objectives w1th
consideration given the college rather than
individual organizations—may not be ob-
tained. Certainly the convocation of these
specifically invited “big wheels” should pro-
duce some beneficial results.

The trend seems to be toward assembling
with increasing representation the various
campus groups, or organizations which are
striving for the same purpose. Effortsare
under way now to combine the religious
clubs under a joint council, to co-direct
their activities toward the attainment of
their individual, but common, goals. Along
the same line, consideration is being given
to a roposed bi-annual meeting of all
administrative and student personnel con-
cerned with budgets, the purpose of which
would be to discuss and clarify the feelings
and standings of those attending on bud-
getary matters.

As for the All College Revue, the objective
for next year should be the fulfillment of
the connotation of the word “all.” It should
not result in a mere skit, but should repre-
sent a focal point in the display of student
interest—a revue of that interest. With an
early planning initiated in the fall, and sub-
sequent rehearsals, cultivation of interest
should result.

We re-recommend, as has been suggested
by our retiring SA president, that assembly
agendas be varied, and not be a repetitious
weekly staging of our government machin-
ery in its oft-times tedious and boring mo-
tion. We ask too: why not schedule paid
assemblies? Variety could be the spice of
interest.

We stand beside our new student admin-
istrators in our mutual cruside to rejuven-
ate interest. We and you are aware of a
problem, which if not arrested, could re-
sult in serious complications. You do your
part, and we will have this rapidly growing
evil exterminated. Come next fall, give your
co-operation and support, consider the time
and efforts that others are s ending for you
—at least show interest an willingness to
accept their laborious and apparently un-
welcomed efforts to work for you. They are
promoting activities which provide the nec-
essary and fruitful ex riences which form
an integral part of co lege life.

Q/om @fu’m’on

— By ROBINSON and OSTOYICH —

Q: The past school year has had
many outstanding events. In your
opinion. what do you recall as being
the most outstanding?

Dwight Willsey '56:

“Perhaps due to the fact that
Moving-Up Day was only last week-
end my opinion of it was most vivid.
This was, I feel, the most outstand-
ing event of the school year."
Richard Clifford '57:

“State Fair, in my opinion, was
the most outstanding event of the
year. It proved that all organiza-
tions on campus can work in mutual
cooperation toward a common goal.
The goal in this event was the rais-
ing of enough money to bring a for-
eign student to State next year. An
event like this promotes better feel-
ings among student groups."
Francis Rogers '54:

"I think the most outstanding
event of the year was the night that
State's basketball team scored 108
points against Utica. It was a new
school record and the game was a
display of some of the finest bas-
ketball prowess seen here at State
in recent years."

I’liylils Forte '55:

“In my opinion, it was the Dawn
Dance. Imagine seeing your friends
wide awake' and dancing at 5 a.m.
when their eyes are closed in 8:10
classes. Student Union Board de-
serves a hand for initiating this
event at State and I'd personally
like to see more of them!"

Joseph Anderson '57:

“I think that one of the most out-
standing events was last Fall's first
annual Homecoming Weekend. It
was very impressive and well plan-

ned. I think it will become an an-
nual event at State."
Ann Tobey '55:

“The controversy over government
revision certainly clarified a lot of
thinking on what kliid of govern-
ment we here at State really want."
Bruno Rodgers ’57

"Of course. to me the most out-
standing event was being elected
president of the best class at State.
I feel that no one could be prouder
of it.”

JoAnne [)0er '54:

“Since I am a member of Stu-
dent Government, 1 am interested
in seeing a lot more school spirit
exhibited. I think Homecoming
Weekend was the most outstanding
event. Here‘s hoping next year's will
be even better."

Robert Crouse ’57:

“Moving-Up Day was the biggest
event to me. It seemed to give us
as freshmen more of an insight into
what college really should mean."
Alice Landon '54:

“State Fair seemed outstanding to
me because more money was earned
than was expected. and it certainly
was for a worthy cause."

Barbara Fox ’57:

"Moving-Up Day was meaningful
to me, especially the skit, which
gave everyone who was interested a
chance to participate without con-
nections with any particular organ-
ization."

Mary Rooney ’55:

“The government revision discus-
sion was the thing I noticed most,
as an off—campus student. It seemed
to concern the majority of the stu-
dents and to be of vital interest to
everyone."

Webster defines a tribute as "an
offering manifesting respect, alle-
giance. and gratitude." We, the
Student Council. who have had the
privilege of working with you this
past year, and the Student Associa-
tion, who have been so capabiy led
by you this past year, offer this to
you. Nell Carlton Brown, manifest-
ing our respect. allegiance, and
gratitude.

The office of SA President is the
highest honor in student govern-
ment that can be attained by a
State student. However. it will be
remembered by you. as by all your
predecessors. that it is also the
hardest job that can be given to a
State student. But Student Asso-
ciation gives the job only to a per-
son in whom it sees the most
experience, the greatest capability,
and the most potentiality. Last
year it chose you. Nell Brown. and
you stepped to the lectern and
microphone in Page for the first
time as leader in that last assem-
bly. You faced the same problems
as your predecessors, plus many
that were not to arise uiitll this
year.

You were the first President of
SA to witness the condensed vcr-
slon of Rivalry; the awarding of the
Rivalry Cup on Campus Day met
with much approval. Your year as
President saw another innovation
-—~~Honiecoming Weekend. The suc-
cess of this venture promises many
future Homecoming Weekends.

You saw the perennial debate of

‘70 Wed

—
compulsory assemblies versus rep-
resentative government come again.
This time a decisive motion was
made and compulsory assemblies
were abolished. with the stipulation
that they remain until a suitable
form of government was presented.
Student Association also has many
recollections of the ever-ready wit of
its President. and had sevural occa-
sions to see a witty remark become
the best answer to a problem.

You recall with pleasure State
Falr~its financial success will help
bring another Foreign Student to

You and your coworkers have
met a great many problems, more
than many previous presidents and
Student Councils. Being the very
responsible person that you rue. you
have tried your best to have a per-
sonal hand in all the work that has
been done toward solving these
problems. You are trying to help
the incoming leaders alleviate prob-
lems with the forthcoming Leader-
ship Conferencc. another innovation.
and a fine one, of your year as
President.

Today you step to the lectern and
microphone in Page for the. last
time. You have made an indelible
mark on student government. Stu-
dent Council aiid Student Associa-
tion have greatly benefited from
your long hours of service. To you
we express our respect, allegiance,
and gratitude.

ELECTIONS

As is the case every year, the MUD ceremonies
brought some surprises. Now that the shouting or
weeping is over, however, it is the job of every mem-
ber of SA. to offer his full support to our leaders.
Interest in activities has been declining all year. Most
individual organizations are suffering from this apathy
as much as S.A. as a whole. Next year's leaders must
do all in their power to revitalize student life, and
they’re going to need plenty of help. Pitch in and
give it to them!

MUSIC, MUSIC. MUSIC

Tonight the six musical groups on campus will of-
fer a fine program in Page Hall. Plan to attend:
we are promised a good evening’s entertainment.

TOVARICH

Don't forget that next Friday and Saturday the
AD. class will present their annual Spring play in
Page Hall. From all reports, it is a fine production,
with several excellent performances. Don’t miss it.

ADIEU

We can use the excuse of this being our last column
and our last year here at State to sound off on vari-
ous subjects.

The most sage advice we can give to you, the under-
classmen, is to take advantage of all aspects of col-
lege life. and to take advantage by contributing. Pri-
marily, of course. and as Dr. Collins likes to point
out, this is an institution of learning. During the four
years of hustle and bustle, we have to be pursuing
some plan of development or growth. Not the least
of the goals of an academic education is the capacity
in the individual for original and intelligent thought.
Original thought, however, is not to be identified
with social eccentricity, as some of us seem to think.

If this is to be a teacher training college, it be-
hooves us to turn out that kind of well balanced in-
dividual who can be a competent educator. That
means that he has to have had sufficient experience
with other people. to feel at ease himself, and so put
them at ease. You do not have to be a social butter-
fly to attain the necessary tact and understanding.
but it stands to reason that the wider your circle of
friends and acquaintances. the more opportunity you
have for developing those qualities. So participate in
what State has to offer (including, we hope. livelier
assemblies). and we hope you have as much fun as we
had.

End of sermon.

PASSING 'l‘IIE BUCK

We wish next year's Common Staters the best of
luck. We would encourage you to use the column to
promote a better Student Association, while never
indulging in personalities, and, as suggested by Joseph
Addison and Richard Steele, “liven morality with wit
and temper wit with morality."

Wi II Upliold
Long Tradition

By CEENIE ENDRENY

In spite of all superstition, Mys-
kania seems to consider thirteen a
lucky number. This year’s newly
elected lucky thirteen are carrying
on a long tradition that began on
Friday the 13th, 1917. It was first
known as Student Council and was
originated by a Faculty Committee.
A week later the organization an-
nounced that its name would be
Myskanla, the meaning of which
was to remain a secret to all except
members.

Their first accomplishment was to
write a constitution for the student
body, and to lead the weekly as-
semblies. Thus Myskania led the way
to student government at State.
Actually, most of the school‘s his-
tory can be traced through the his—
tory of Myskania. The judicial body
founded and organized practically
all the major groups on campus.

In its first year Myskania provid-
ed a News Board and a News Con-
stitution to the infant State College
News. It also inaugurated in that
year the now-traditional custom of
tapping the incoming members of
Myskania. This ceremony was just
one part of the first full—length

One of the big events of the fol-
Moving-Up Day.
lowing year. which was reported as
a “long-echoing shock," was Mys-
kle's suggestion to Student Associa—
tion that it originate a dramatics
club. In March, 1919. Dramatlcs and
Art Council was introduced.

In 1920 the system of class officers
was incorporated and Campus Day
rivalry was begun. Rivalry itself
was initiated two years before be—
cause Myskaniu felt that it would
be a solution to a "badly—needed
unified college spirit."

The active judicial body drew up
and submitted a Student Associa-
tion Constitution in 1921 and insti-
tuted a point system which was

similar to the Major—Minor Office
Plan in 1924.

During the war years Myskania
rose to the occasion by sponsoring
victory drives, blood banks, and Red
Cross drives.

The thirtieth anniversary for
Myskanla marked a turning point
in its career. Up to that time fivc
members each ye 11' had been select-

basis that it had created Student

be changed by the latter. However,
