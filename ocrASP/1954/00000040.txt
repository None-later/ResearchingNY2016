Last year at this time, as we
assumed our new position, one ques-
tion bothered us—Who would take
the place of our graduating ath-
letes? Would they be as outstand-
ing as their predecessors? Today
as we review the past year, new
competitors have been responsible
for much of State's success.

Perhaps one of the biggest shots
in the arm, State could get came
from Joe Garcia's soccer squad. The
booters notched a commendable 8-2,
record against the top Eastern
competition. New faces became
State's heroes. The Lindberg bro-
thers. John and Bill, who trans-
ferred from Champlain topped
State’s goal getters. John's spirited
play won him an All-American
honor. Freshman finds were A]
Rockleln, Tito Guglielmone, John

Pengelly, Al Lederman. and Ev
Weiermillcr.
Basketball season found the

statesmen still playing in the
cramped confines of Page Hall.
Coach Hathaway came up with Lou
Carr and Sig Smith as replace-
ments for Telfer and Tabor 01'
previous campaigns. John Centra,
captain of the squad had a great
year, leading the team to a 13-7
season. The highlights of State's
feats were a 108-94 thrashing of
Utica and a. 4-overtime thriller
victory over New Haven.

The freshman class produced
standouts John Rookwood and Joe
Anderson. Don Nolan became a new
hardwood ace. Jack Peacock as a
transfer helped the squads. Mid-
season produced two more finds in
Denny Dempster and Chris Bogui-
ges.

Spring meant baseball, and prac-
tice sessions found Coach Hatha-
way back at the helm. Bad Wea-
ther has hurt the squad because of
the limited outdoor practice. But
even after the first few games we
could see that Sig Smith, Leon Og-
rodnick, Chris Bogaiges. and Tom
Shurnanski were going to prove
mighty important men.

Varsity letter winners at State
got together and reorganized the
Varsity “S” Club with John Centra
as president. As a result. a new ath-
letic award was instituted, that of"
a varsity sweater. MAA and AA
boards came up with the plans for
an athletic banquet to be held in
May as an annual affair.

In the fraternity leagues, Al’A
became the new football champs
beating Potter by 2 touchdowns—
ns predicted by Ray Wolfe. Potter
Club retained basketball supremacy
by routing the Hooters. SLS edged
past. APA for the bowling crown in
a terrific race. In tournament play
APA took the vollyball title. Sofi-
ball is still to go and we think it
should be close.

We have recapped somewhat the
year in sports emphasizing the new-
comers who helped makc the year
so eventful. We would like to give
special praise to two guys who have
done 11 tremendous job this year
for this stuff—Frank McEvoy and
Joe Swiezowski. Frank followed the
varsity sports for the year, while
Joe handled the 1M chores. Special
credit 011 the year goes also to Dot-
tie Rasmussen, our girl's sports
writer and Arnie Newman, who was
on the spot whenever needed.

Next year new freshman and
transfer students will provide State
fans with new thrills, but we shall
never forget the old pro's. Famil-
inr names that will be missing from
the score books next season are
John Contra, Itob Gillespie, “Ili-
ram" Walker, and John Allnsio
from basketball; Ben IIutton from
soccer and wrestling; Joe Stella
from soccer and baseball; and Hank
Hull from soccer.

Walt Bur'bnsh, Stutc's hcud man
with the medicine kit will be gone
also, Ray Wolfe. who lid 11 trcmcn-
dons job on the APRB and was
active 111 wrestling and baseball
will step down, as will John Mc-
Cormick who coached the little
Peds 111 basketball and pitched for
the baseball squad.

StatewFaces Hartwick
In Baseball Tilt Today

Seek First Win
After Rainouts

States baseball team makes an-
other attempt to break into the
win column today when it enter-
tains the Hartwick College aggre-
gation. After having a rainout of
their game against Potsdam last
Saturday and a curtailment of
Tuesdays tilt at Oneonta, the squad
has high hopes that the Albany
weatherman will finally c o m e
through with a fear weather fore-
cast. The scene of today's contest
will‘switch from the usual Bleeker
Stadium to that of Hawkins Sta-
dium, home of Albany's Eastern
League representatives—the Sena-
tor.

Because of a 5 o'clock curfew on
the use of the stadium. Coach Ha-
thaway is in doubt whether the
scheduled doubleheader will come
about. Contact with the Hartwick
management as to the cancellation
of the second game had not come
about as this paper went to press.

Sage Sprains Ankle

Tuesday's shortened affair with
Oneonta ended with a combination
of the good and bed. 011 the worst
side of the ledger, Bob Sage came
011‘ the field with a sprained ankle
as 11 result of the treacherous field
condition. Oneonta had its share of
miser too as one of their starts
was spiked badly when he slid into
second. On the brighter side of the
story, however, Hathaway came back
from the sojourn with high hopes
concerning the local's hitting po-
tentiality. For the first time this
season, State has shown some c0111-
mendnble clutch hitting. This. in
turn, has brought about high as-
pirations that a sharp decline will
be brought in the "left on base"
department. As of now the Peds
have veraged 10 to 12 stranded
men a game.
Rain Ends inning of Play

The game itself lasted only an
inning when heavy rains forced its
cancellation. but nevertheless it
contained its share of high spots.
Stella opened the inning with 11
“perfect” bunt that went in vain
when 11c slipped 111 the mud as he
crossed the batters box. With two
outs. Bogulges placed a two bugger
which scored Sage who had walked
and stole second. After Lein drew a
free puss, Ogrodnlck came through
with a clutch single that went
whistling over third scoring Lein.

 

EEP, Finks Lead
Softball Leagues;
KB Splits Pair

The sun shone intermittently
this week, just long enough to allow
a fairly full slate of IM softball
games to be played. Ridge House
continued 011 the winning path by
beating KB 20-16, despite a 13 run
rally 111 the sixth inning by the
fratmen. Jacobson hurled for the
winners, while Kirsch absorbed the
loss. The Finks behind the careful
pitching 01' Muller defeated the 111-
tellect laden Scholars 6-3. Benanati
was the losing pitcher. The finest
pitching performance came in the
game between Potter and the Rou-
sers, when Al Rcecklein pitched a
no hitter us the Clubmen won 13-0.
Willie and Butler shared hurling
duties t'or the weak-striking Rous-
ers.

KB Upends 69ers

Friday's games between the APA-
ches and the 69ers ended in a 13-9
victory for the 69ers. Matthews
started but was relieved by Bailey,
the eventual winner.

The game between Potter and
Ridge House, Tuesday, was one of
the finest played this season. with
Potter coming out on top 6-2. Rocc-
klein and Jacobson pitched for the
respective teams, while Bernstein
and Roecklein hit homers for the
Pottermen, and Bottino and Gutin
stacked triples to lead the Ridge
House attack. The other games, the
69ers suffered a reversal at the
hands of Kappa Bet 2-6, and 81.18
lost to the Finks 8-3. Kirsch pitched
and batted his way to victory over
the 69ers with sterling support
from his nine mudders, while Bailey
suffered the loss. Batterymate Bob
Davidson played a fine ground he-
hind the plate. The Finks behind
Muller, overcame the SL8 squad
and "The Great" Corsi 111 a well
played encounter.

Scholars Overcome SLS

111 an abbreviated 5 inning tilt,
the Scholars behind Benanatl de-
feated the SLS team and “The
Great" Corsi 8-6. Ridge House
came bounding buck, upending the
69ers 13-5. Jacobson chucked for
the winners while Matthews and
Bailey twlrled for the 69ers.

Nats of the National Basketball As-
sociation. Fran Rogers and Jim
Finnen are in charge 01' Arrange-
ments. while Tom Rogue and Tom

Shumanski will take charge of sell-
ing tickets to this event.

In the past years, all athletic
awards have been given out at an
informal smoker conducted at the
conclusion of the school year. These
smokers never seemed to generate
enough interest to attract an ade-
quate number of people to them.
The membership of AA and MAA
hope that a banquet will be more
successful in arousing student 111-
terest. and will warrant Its contin-
uance as an annual affair.
