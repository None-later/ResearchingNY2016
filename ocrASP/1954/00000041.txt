Last Saturday held many sur-
prises and not least among them
was the result of the long-suffering
All-College Skit Committee. ..The
Grass Is Always Greener. directed
by Mary Ann Johnpoll and Evie
Ruben, proved to be a delightful
hour. and a half of frothy enter-
tainment despite the difficulties
which arose in rehearsals.

The show opened with a dis-
organized scene satirizing television
detectives. Its purpose, a. good one,
fell flat through a pointless script
and poor handling of the dialogue.
The second scene was bright and
cheery and gained a favorable im-
pression for the show which con-
tinued through to the end. Gil
Schloss, Al Welner, and Marie De-
vine were the funniest Westerners
seen in a long time. Ric's person-
ality was a show highlight. Weiner
scored again as Gaylord Towser in
the third scene, an hilarious take-
off on body building courses.

The high point of the entire pro-
duction was next in sight, “A
Stranger in Paradise.” The beau-
tiful music from Kismet supplied a
haunting and stimulating back-

ground to help transport the audi-
ence to an Arabian Nights scene.
The chorus performed profession-
ally in this ballet sequence with
skilled creativity displayed in the
soloists' performances. J. Ruben
Garcia, Jean Morris, and Bobble
Stein all deserve special bouquets.
The costumes were all that could
be desired for an Arabian night.

The remainder of the show was
fine, with special notation given to
the dance performed so gracefully
by Art Stone and Angie Kavanaugh‘,
the hilarious appearances of Ar-
lene Yanks and J. Whitehurst, the
chorus' rendition of "Two O‘Clock
Jump," and J. Arthur's Rank Pro-
duction. Art Lennlg once again
turned out an excellent movie, a
satire on State College life, which
had some very effective camera
shots, showing the true genius of
our great director!?!!

Well, with the performances of
’l‘ovarich on May 21 and 22, our
dramatic activities at State will
once again be concluded. This has
been an exceptionally fine year for
state drama-wise, I believe. The
AD plays were all well-chosen to

.\.

“Chesterfield. for M. I"

“Thirty years’ scientiﬁc research goes into
this cigarette. I’ve seen Chesterfield's
research laboratories and I‘ve seen how
they’re made! I wouldn’t smoke any other
cigarette but Chesterfield!”

produce a varied field of entertain-
ment for the many students who
have come to feel that Tuesday is
drama. night on our campus. We
can never forget Faustus for its
extravagance in settings, costumes.
and lighting, as well as for its many
fine performances. Likewise, the
other AD plays cannot be for-
gotten: Thompson’s Comedy, Bush's
hilarious modern romantic delight.
Duclos’ alltime favorite story of ro-
mantic courage, and Orser's charm-
ing scene are only a few of the
many. Performances from these
plays will always remain with us.
for so many of them were very fine.
The proved talent of someone like
Dottie Mehan in Pygmalion was en-
joyed as much as the newly discov-
ered talent of Tush Barber in Joan
Carlin’s play. These things have
made up an integral part of our
life at State and they should be
remembered. Thanks must go to
D&A for their fine productions, as
well as to Dr. Pettit for Trojan
Women and to Miss Futterer for
all of her help, work. friendly ad-
vice. and for her final AD presen-
tation, which is bound to be a
success. Tovarich.
