SIS Service
To Start Soon

There are two means of communi-

which aid in keeping students in-

Through the Student Information
Service (SIS) the faculty keeps in
contact with the students. Various
organizations utilize the student
mailboxes in the Richardson Com-
mons to notify students of activi-
ties.

The SIS lists, which can be found
in Draper, Richardson and Husted
Halls. list the names of students al-
phabetically and set the designated
spot where students are to go to
confer with administrative officials
and members of the faculty.

All students are urged to check
these lists so that they will not miss
meetings, conferences and appoint-
ments.

Student mailboxes are located in
Richardson Commons. The mail-
boxes are alphabetized according to
surnames for the convenience of the
students.

Through the student mailboxes,
students receive notices of the va-
rious planned activities scheduled
