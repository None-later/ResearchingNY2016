4m ‘71:. schism

By BOB ASHE”)

 

Now that the summer is over and
the “back to school" signs have been
hung out, we can relax—for a con-
ple of minutes at least. While we're
relaxing we have an opportunity to
scan the new frosh invasion, and if
oily can stop for a second, we'll join
in with the others and say “Wel-
come” which is well used word by
row.

“Edna” sort of disrupted things
at Men's Frosh Camp this year and
as a result the frosh didn't have
much of a chance to show their
wares . athletic-wise anyway. De-
spite this, rumors are already leak-
ing out that there are few good
hoopers in the throng, which should
interest Coach Hathaway. Just an
added note that one belonging to
this rumor group is from none other
than Orange County.

And the “County” didn‘t do State
any harm during the past four
years.

As usual Joe Garcia has his men
out already getting in condition for
the first big tussle against Fordham
in two weeks. The squad should do
all right again this year with John
and Bill Lindberg and Don Can-
onica, who is co-captain along with
Bill back. Incidently John is expect-
ation of an early practice spent all
summer here. Besides the “Big
Three" there should be a lot of help
i‘rom last year’s Frosh all-star array
of Ev Weiremuller, Al Roeklein,
Tito Guglielmone, Al Lederman, Bill
Bonesteel, and John Pengelley.

By the way if there are any of
you Frosh who can play soccer and
who haven’t made an appearance
at practice you’d better watch out
for Joe because this is serious.

Well it’s real hard to admit but
it looks like the Indians are in.
We're die-hard Yankee fans but
facts are facts.. We would like to
see the Giants take all the marbles
but it looks as though Cleveland
over New York in as few games as
five. While we're sticking out necks
out on predictions, how about Willie
Mays and Bobby Avila as the re-
spective M. V. P. 's of the National
and American Leagues. For “Rookie
of the Year“ honors we'll nominate
Wally Moon of the Cardinals and
Bob Grim of the Yanks.

This is our ﬁrst column of the
year but also our last as we move
up to succeed Raymie Wolfe as Di-
rector of the Athletic Public Rela-
tions Board. We have had an en-
joyable experience if nothing more
working with the NeWs for the past
three years and feel quite secure in
leaving this job in the capable
hands of Joe Swierzowski, Frank
McEvoy, Arnie Newman and com-
pany. We hope that you will glvv
them as much cameration us you
have us. Good luck!

ceive brochures which will include
facts and ﬁgures on thc players. this

Two other departments that will
function for the beneﬁt of all the
publicity mcdiufms are photognnihy
and statistics. A complete file of
pictures taken at all of State‘s ath-
letic contests will be kept and will
be available to the News, Fed, and

Garcia, in the quest of bettering
last year's 8—2 won lost record, has
been running the Doctors through
two practice sessions daily. In the
morning stress is placed on condi—
tioning and the forming of new
combinations to replace those bro-
kcn up by graduation.

The first opposition the Booters
will face will be Fordham Univer-
sity on the second of October. The
ginnc, slated to be played at Bev—
crwyck Field. will get underway at 2
pm.

Garcia has also put out a call for
all freshmen who are interested to
come out for soccer. High school
cxpcricncc is not necessary. Should
a suffician number of frosh take a
crack at the game Garcia has hillt—
ed at the possibility of starting a
freshman tcam. A call is also out
for personnel. The team is in need
of lnnncrs and managers. Anyone

Counselors Split

Volleyball Series
With Freshmen

By ARNIE NEWMAN

“The waters prevailed and in-
creased . . . so mightin upon the
earth that all the high mountains
under th-: whole heaven were cov-
cred."

Noah appears to have had to face
the saint problem as the potential
athletes at Fresh Camp, excessive
rain, but whereas Noah had little
cnance to actively participate in
sports on the ark decks, the frosh
did mamge to squeeze in a varied
program of sports competition be-
tween gusts and spray delivered by
Hurricane Edna.

Friday afternoon was sunny, the
lake shimmered with tones of blue
and green, and possibly with ice
crystals as the few hearty souls who
look the plunge soon discovered.
However, the basketball, badminton
and tenan courts, as well as the
football, baseball and volleyball
ﬁelds were all taken up with a full
complement of active freshmen and
counselors. After a hearty supper
there wa~. rowing and canoeing on
darkening Warner's Lake for those
had not drowned during the after-
noon and who were willing to wield
the six-ounce bailing can on the
water-ﬁlled boats.

Softball Galne Called

"Attention! Attention! The 7 am.
swim has been cancelled." These
ominous words blared over the loud-
speaker system in dulcet tones by
director Bob Sage started oil a Sat-
urday dominated by indoor basket-
ball, volleyball, and ping pong, and,
of course. Edna. In two viciously
played encounters a picked frosh
volleyball squad managed to split
with a counselor team. the counse-
lors winning the ﬁrst game and
jllSt being nipped in the second. The
most serious casualty of the day
was the cancellation of the fresh-
faculty softball game. one of the
more informal student-faculty joint
activities, and an annual highlight
of Frosh Camp. However, the re-
spected professors probably saved
some strain on their dignity due to
the permanent postponement, and
Edna may have indirectly helped to
cement a cordial relationship be-
tween instructors and the Class of
'58. Those fresh looked like awfully
tough ball players.

As may be seen by reading the
Athletic Public Relation Board Story
on this page, Bob Ashfield has re-
signed as Sports Editor of the News
to take over as director of APRB.
Bob began early in sports writing
by being a Junior Sports Writer
in his Sophomore year. In his Jun—
ior year he became sports editor,
the first Junior ever to attain this
position.

Through the past two years many
have enjoyed Bob's colulnns and
sports articles and without a doubt
his writings will be missed by all
readers of the News. Bob has a very
kccn interest in sports as is evi-
dan by the sunny hours he devoted
in Working on the NeWs sport page
and the Public Relations Board.

Now Bob leaves to assume a pos-
ition that he is well qualified for.
Under him the APRB should do
much to spread the coverage of
State‘s sports to greater areas, We,
of the News sports stuff, want to
wish Bob all the. luck in the world.

To take over in Bob's shadows
is w great task. Olll‘ feeling of in-
security we are hoping will disap~
pcur us we gain more experience in
the sports writing field. With all
that Bob has taught us in the past
year plus lhe continued coopera-
lloll of all sports groups involved
we hope to cover sports storys in the
impartial and interesting fashion
that Bob Ashficld always did.
