STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1954

Fresh - Look Sharp! Be Sharp;
Wear Dior’s Latest '58 Fashions

“What am I going to wear?” was
the first question posed by every
little sister. Each Junior GGuide
tried to disclose the vital facts of
the case and just the facts to her
little sis. Here is a condensed resu-
me of the facts taken in a survey of
one upperclassman.

School wear is strictly formal.
The male population usually at-
tends classes dressed in dark busi-
ness suits, white shirts with French
cuffs, and a conservative tie; and
for that nonchalant air—sneakers.
Naturally girls must dress in accord,
wearing those charming men’s tail-
ored suits, business sheers and heels.

The dungarees and Bermuda shorts
of last season are definitely out for
casual wear. Christian Dior has sent
his latest design to State in com-
memoration of the Class of 1958.
From now on the well-dressed coed
at the soccer or basketball game or
lounging in the Union will be wear—
ing the belted hip, the shortened
hemllne, and the longer glance.

Hair this year is definitely grow-

ing. D.A.'s and Italian boys are
a thing of the past. The Chrysanthe-
mum and cap-cuts are coming into
vogue. If You’re wearing a pony-
tail, better send it back to Steve
Brody or trade it for a bun.

Upperclassmen will be sticking
to their Greek togas for publicity’s
sake. All the Alphas and Sigmas
will be displayed in their fullest glo-
ry in every color of the rainbow.

Receptions, parties and banquets
have been designed to send the
sporty set scampering to the near-
est salon for the latest darling cre-
ation. State tradition, however, for-
bids the frosh to wear anything but
black or navy frocks with lace or
organdy collars. Grandma's day of
Arsenic and old lace, is retm‘ning.
etter look up the rusty button hooks.

The worse possible fate of any
student is to be improperly garbed
for a. particular affair. Where should
one wear what ware? Don't get
caught Sans a beanie if you're a
fearless frosh. The Sophomores dic-
tate that fashion phase.

Student Activity Card
Will Appear Sept. 28

Student Tax cards will be replac-
ed this semester by a new student
activity card, reports Ronald Kos-
ter, ’55. The new cards will be en-
closed in plastic and will contain
a picture of the individual student
to whom it was issued.

The new cards will be available
Tuesday, September 28, near the
Rotunda. In order to secure an ac-
tivity card, students must present
their student receipt card issued to
them during registration.

The cards will be punched with
an “S” punch when issued to reg-
ularly enrolled students. Each suc-
ceeding semester the cards will be
punched again. Each of the cards
is designed to be used for a period
of four years, thus freshmen will
keep the same card throughout their
four years at State.

The activity card admits students
to all plays and other school events,
and entities students to a copy of
the Pedagogue, Primer, Directory,
and to copies of the State College
News.

If a card is lost, the student
should immediately notify Sue Barn-
hart ‘56, ecretary of Student Board
of Finance to obtain a new card at
his expense.

Music Council
To Present Pianist

Music Council members met at
the home of Dr. and Mrs. Charles
F .Stokes at an informal party
Wednesday evening to discuss plans
for their forthcoming concert, slated
for October 13.

Kathryn Johnston '55, President
of Music Council, reports that the
Council has arranged to have Ste-
ven Lipkin, pianist, give a concert
that evening.

The aim of Music Association is
two-fold. cultural and social. The
association is governed by a Coun-
cil composed of from ﬁfteen to
twenty members. In the spring, the
operetta class, open to all students,
presents an opertta, directed by the
music faculty and student assist-
ants. Other programs to be sponsor-
ed by the Council this year are: a
program by the music faculty, a
choral concert, and a spring ensem-
ble concert.

Members of Music Council in ad-
dition to the President are: Barbara
Murnane ’56, Secretary; Carol Ger-
cty ’56, Treasurer; and twenty
members at large.

Flags Fly
At Half Mast

Big Brother is watching you:
and you left that coffee cup on
the table in the Snack Bar. Get
that foot off the chair and pick
up those books. Do you think
this is a democracy?

The Pentagon with all its red
tape couldn‘t be as messy as
the cigarette butts, candy wrap-
pers and coke bottles on the
ﬂoor of the Commons. The time
has come for the President to
give a “State of the Union"
message.

Flag Day has come to State.
The Snack Bar has posted a
banner that comes out and
practically picks up your
dirty dishes for you. Why
not save it the trouble? Coats
are not suitable ﬂags to be hung
at half mast on a convenient
chair, either.

It's everyone's Union and
Commons; yours and mine. I
picked up my junk. How about
you?
