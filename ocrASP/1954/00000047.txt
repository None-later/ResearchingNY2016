Appearing in the University Daily
Kansan was this fashion note: “If

A headline in The Duke Chronicle

For the beneﬁt of the frosh, we

appeared last year.

Beckwith said that a Joint meet-
ing of Student Council, Student
Board of Finance, the Administra-
tion, and Mr. Gelbond would be
held to determine policy concerning
ﬁnancial authority. The meeting was
set for the last week of October.

It was suggested that a perman-
ent committee be appointed to study
the SA Constitution for clariﬁca-
tion of certain passages, and other
improvements. The committee is to
be elected at the next Council meet-
ing.

Thomas Dixon '55 moved that a
Leadership Conference be held be-
tween the Thanksgiving and Christ-
mas vacations. The motion was
passed, and another conference was
set for next spring.

The ﬁrst assembly will be held
today at 10 am. On the agenda will
be the introduction of the Deans, an
address by President Collins, intro-
duction of SA ofﬁcers. and an-
nouncements. including one from
Arthur Kapner.

To the Editor:

I think the administration de-
serves a pat on the back for the
job they did with the schedule. Al-
though the eight o'clock classes
seem at least an hour earlier than
last year‘s eight—tens, the free pe-
riods at ten for class meetings and
assembly should improve attend-
ance at those affairs.

Concerning registration, I still
had a great deal of frustration and
certainly a good case of aching feet
and a very sore pocketbook, but I
imagine the IBM machines will en-
able the registrar to carry out the
necessary details more easily.

A very lnunedlate beneﬁt of the
new schedule is the relief of the
lunchroom situation. One can now
get something to eat with consid-
erably less shoving, waiting, and
general commotion. In the not too
distant future, however, even the
staggered, lengthened, periods will
not be sufﬁcient to handle the in-
creased enrollment. Better facilities
will have to be provided.

By JOE SWIERZOWSKI

 

Now that registration is com-
plate and classes are well underway
many of us may find that actually
we do have spare time on our hands.
whether it be two hours a day or a
two hours a week. The natural ten-
dency is to spend the time either
at the Union or at the dorm “shoot—
ing the breeze." In doing so a large
number of us may overlook the
possibility of spending our time at
a. more useful recreation—that is
participating in the Intraimiral
sports program.

Everyone, regardless of whether
his athletic ability is practically nil
or not, should see to it that he gets
the proper amount of exercise need-
ed for maintaining good health.
The IM program deﬁnitely is the
answer to this need.

The MAA ofﬁcials and league
commissioners have worked hard to
set up a varied program. Practically
every sport is offered. Present fall
sports include football, soccer, bad—
minton, vollyball. tennis, and golf.
Likewise new and better systems of
running the leagues more smoothly
have been set up. Competition,
though somewhat keen, should not
be an excuse for the exemption of
anyone. Lack of a team to play on
also need not be an alibi. llil offi-
cials will find room for anyone who
wants to play but who does not
have the-Opportunity to join any
team.

Looking at the sign—up sheets in
Lower Draper. we began to wonder
where all the IM potential is. Male
enrollment in State College l'iVU or
six years ago numbered 350 yet 50
per cent of the men turned out for
at least one sport. Today, with well
over seven hundred men the possi-
bilities of dropping certain IM
sports is being considered because
of the hick of support.

We're not advocating that every-
one go activity crazy and sign up
for all the sports, but rather that
each individual should sign up
for at least one sport—today (which
incidentally is the last. day for
some activities.)

Another peeve wc have is that the
only teams taking part in IM seem
to bc the frats. Wc‘d likc to see
more group houses and organiza-
tions come up with icams. Thch
is still time. If we may. we‘d like
to suggest to the frcsh to organize
a football team at their ncxt class
meeting. Let the Blue Jay spirit
sound off from the start!

Only through thcsc mans can thc
IM program fulfill its purpose and
be of benefit to all.

Appoint League Commissioners

 

” M2424 ﬂuted Widely VariediiSports Program
Outlined To intramural Athletes .

At a meeting of Men‘s Athletic Association held Tuesday night, Pres-
ident Thomas Hogue outlined a widely varied program of Intramural
Sports. The names of the various league commissioners were named for
the fall program which is due to get underway beginning next week.

 

As a. matter of interest this week,
we would like to publish a list of
rules governing the general conduct
and responsibilities of the Commis-
sioner or league manager of Intra-
mural activities. The Captains and
Assistant Commssioner also have
specified duties and we would like
to have them stated herewith.

The Commissioner of IntraMural
leagues shall:

1. Organize the league

2. Prepare a schedule of games

3. Set down decisions in dis-
putes upon the recommendation of
the protest board.

4. Set up championships.

5. Give weekly reports to MAA
and keep team records.

6. Provide for an election of a
new assistant commissioner at the
end of the intramural season.

The commissioner also has the
duties to make the captains of each
intramural team responsible for:

1. Roster and roster changes 24
hours prior to the actual games.

2. Outlining the playing field up-
on the designated day of play and
providing for referees for the game.

The General Manager of the
League ialso known as the Assist-
ant Commissioner of the League)
shall:

1. Make certain each team has
a manager who turns in a record
to him of each man who has played.

2. Check out and check in all
equipment from the locker in the
locker room.

In addition, MAA also states that
both commissioners are responsible
for a written report at the end of
the season containing a record of
who played, how much each player
participated, what games were play-
ed and recommendations for the
next year.

Cheer Makers
Slate Practices,-
Lisi Openings

Wllh the approach of the season’s
soccer opener around the corner.
October 2, the Albany State Cheer—
leaders called their ﬁrst meeting
Wednesday night to disuss plans for
the coming year. Iggy Komanowskl
who is in charge of the Cheerleaders
stated that the response was very
good. Iggy likewise stated that any
girl who is interested in trying out
should contact her through Student
Mail. Freshmen girls are reminded
that they too are eligible.

The senior Cheerleaders back
from last year are Angie Kavanaugh
and Ann Branco. The only Junior to
return to lead the Fed rooters is
Jane Ide. Moving up from the fresh-
men class lnto their second year of
cheering are Bev Wyer, Peggy Wil-
liams, and Phyllis Roberts.

The hard work and zealous at-
titude these girls display in daily
practices is excelled by few such
groups. Their zeal. though hidden by
the empty bleachers in workouts,
nevertheless, becomes apparent
when the Pods make their entrance
into the games. Their shouts echo—
ing through the bandbox of Page
or carried by the winds on Bever-
wyck Field do much to raise that
much heard of "spirit" on the
team. It’s hats off to these girls
for all their interest and effort.

Another sport slated to get under-
way will be golf. An eighteen hole
tournament has been mapped out
by Commissioner Raymond Milnarik.
The tourney is scheduled to be play-
ed on the public links.

Walter Whitson. Volleyball Com-
missioner, has called a meeting for
all team captains for Tuesday eve-
ning, September 28. Provided the
weatherman cooperates, Walt has
stated that the tourney will be a
double elimination affair to be
played on Page Field. Whitson also
wishes to make clear that this is
not the regular volleyball league.
The league itself will be run off as
an indoor winter sport.

Stark Heads Tennis

Another loop leader that must
rely on the cooperation of the Al-
bany Weather Bureau is David
Stark, who will head the tennis
tourney. Both singles and doubles
tournaments are offered. The site
of these matches will be the courts
of Washington Park.

Taking a stab at a new Intra-
mural activity, the MAA advisers
have augumented their program
with soccer. The sport which has
fared so well as a varsity sport is
under the direction of Donald Can-
onica, a co-captain of the Varsity
booters.

To round out the slate of games
badminton is also planned. Head-
ing the shuttlecock game will be
Randy Dudley.

Following the outlining of the
fall sports programs the possibility
of awarding various awards to IM
victors was discussed. To add to
the incentive of would-be partici-
pants, a committee of Tom Hog'ue,
Walt Whitson. and Cliff Davis was
appointed to look further into the
idea.
