Studio Contract

Koster Urges Students
To Make Appointments

The Sargent Studios, Photograph-
ers of the 1955 Pedagogue, have an-
nounced that the students have bro—
ken their contract with them by
not showing up to have their pie-
tures taken. The students of State
College are guilty in this matter
and as a. result have forced upon
the photographers this sudden an-
nouncement. Only two-thrds of the
students who signed up to be pho-
tographed have done so. Unless
more students do get photographed
the Studios will leave as of tomor-
row.

Seniors. Honoraries. Sororities
and Fraternities have been guilty of
signing up for a period of time and
not showing up for the period that
was reserved especially for them.

Ronald Koster ‘54, Editor-in-Chief
was able to get a minimum of eight
proofs for a txvo dollar fee because
of the arrangement of having thirty
people photographed a day.

Thirty people have signed up but
only twenty people have arrived to
be pluitogi'iiphed per day. The presi—
dent of the corporation iSargent
StudioSi is threatening to relieve
l’ediigogue of the photographer as
of tomorrow.

Anyone who has signed up for
this week is reminded to show up
for his appointments and to ask
other people who haven‘t signed,
to come, in case someone doesn‘t
show tip. They might fit into the
schedule.

If enough students do not sign up,
lhc photographer will leave tomor-
row illlll break the contract. A new
photographer, at this time of the
year. will charge three to four dol-
lui's per sitting for oiin three or
four proofs.

Post - Your - Eyes
Milk For Peds

A new cow has been grazing
outside the Commons for a
week. It has been milking thir-
sty students every day.

More mothers recommend
their brand. But who’s going
to recommend a satisfactory
method of making the machine
work? As much as thirty cents
has been spent in futile at-
tempts to taste the nectar of
an orange.

Good fortune struck for one
out of a hundred when the ma-
chine said “tilt” and paid off
for We milks for the price of
a half.

The row seems to convenient~
ly run dry when money is depo-
sited. Perhaps it hasn't been in-
troduced to Mr. IBM, the most
important man on the campus.

If everyone has to continue
nudging the machine, it will
start spurting milk shakes and
orange fizz.
