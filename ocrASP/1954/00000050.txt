Here’s a little nonsense from the
Tempo of Chicago Teachers College:
See John

See this Student
His name is John
John is a Good Boy
He is very quiet
This is the Lost and Found
John is still here
He is unclaimed
Who is to blame
If John is unmarked
He is not Bright.
Some more nonsense from the
same publication:
Jack: “And you say radio an—
nouncers have small hands?"
Ann: “Sure. Wee paws for sta-
tion identification.
From the pages of The Bucknei-
lian of Bucknell University:
Prof: “Young man, why aren't
you taking notes?"
M.E.: “I don’t need to, sir, I got
my grandfather's."
Here's a few quotes from the
pages of the Tor-Echo from Alfred
University:

“Don’t be afraid of your past.
Write a best seller.”

“The Optimist fell ten stories, and
at each window bar he shouted to
his friends: All right, so far.

"A woman will try on any num-
ber of shoes before she’s finally dis-
satisfied.”

“Recently a laundry sign was no-
ticed which read: “We do not tear
your laundry with machinery. We
do it carefully by hand’."

From the Rensselaer Polytechnic:
Following are fifteen ways in which
to fail a course:

1. Enter the course as late as
possible. By changing your mind
about the curriculum after school
starts, you should be able to avoid
classes until the second or third
week.

2. Do not bother with a text book.

3. Put your social life ahead of
every thing else. If necessary, cul-
tivate a few friendships in the class.
Interesting conversation should be
able to drown out the noise of the
lecture.

4. Observe how seedy professors
look alid treat them accordingly.

5. Make yourself comfortable
when you study. If possible, draw
up an easy chair by a window.

6. Have a few friends handy dur-
ing the study period so you can
chat when the work becomes dull.

7. If you must study, try to lump
it all together and get it over with.
The most suitable tinie would be the
last week of school.

8. Keep your study table interest-
ing. Place photographs, magazines,
goldfish bowls, games and other
recreational devices around you
while studying.

9. Use ineinonic devices on every-
thing you learn. Since they are easy
to forget. this approach keeps your
mind from getting cluttered up
With stale facts.

10. Never interrupt your reading
by checking on what you have learn—
ed. Recitation is not very pleasant
any how. since it shows u') your de-
licicncies.

11. Avoid bothering with note-
books. If you plan to use one any
how, so that you can draw pictures
of airplanes during the lecture, try
to follow the simplest arrangement:
keep all the notes for a given day
on the same sheet of paper.

12. Remind yourself frequently
how dull the course is. Never lose
sight of the fact that. you really
wanted to sign up for something
else.

13. Review only the night before
examinations, and colifinc this to
trying to guess what the teacher
will ask.

14. Find out exactly when your
final examination will be over M)
you can plan to forget everything
about the course at liuit moment,

15. Join the Poly.

With two weeks of long and ted-
ious drills over the stage is set for
Coach Joe Garcia and his men to
inaugurate another soccer campaign.
The question immediately pops to
mind: Can State live up to or bet-
ter last year's fine records? To be-
gin with Garcia has back his “Big
Three' Co-Captains Bill Lindberg
and Don Canoniea plus All Ameri-
can John Llndberg. By now we've
completely run out of adjectives to
describe their tremendous play. Of
course no team can get along with
only three men and so it is with
State. Forced to play in the shad-
OWs of these three are such fine
booters as Al Roeckleiii, John Peli-
gelly. and Al Lederinan. Bill Bone-
steel. Tito Guglielmone, Phil Bill-
ings, and Ev Weiermlller further
give Garcia great hopes of bettering
last year‘s 8-2 won lost record. Back
too is Ralph Adams, a fine defen-
sive booter. Outstanding new talent
in men like Paul Dammer and Ed
Jones also make Joe optomistic.

Soccer is a game that perhaps
some of the frosh as well as some
new students have never seen. It
may come as a surprise to you to
learn that soccer is the world's most
popular sport. Forced to take a back
seat in the US. it nevertheless is
the national pastime of many coun—
tries. It is a fast moving game that
calls for good brainwork as well as
footwork. Those who have never
seen it have a treat coming tomor-
row when Statc entertains the high-
ly touted Fordham University team.

Tomorrow's game could bring out
possible new potential. The only
thing that's needed for a winning
team now is student support. Last
year‘s turnouts were good, but this
year we are hoping they will be
even better.

State students owe it to them-
selves to get out there and supllorl
the team tomorrow. While you and
I were arriving at oulleee and Just
beginning to register, these men
were out there running, kicking
(the onuCCI' ball that is) and sweat-
ing for three or four hours daily.
We need not mention how much
good it does the team's moral to see
it huge crowd to play before. Every-
one, we‘re sure, knows that. These
men have done imlch to bring
State's name iii sports to greater
and greater areas. All we need to do
to be out there on Beverwyck
tomorrow.

Two Casualities
In 4-4 Deadlock

After a thrilling scrimmage on
Beverwyck field this past Tuesday,
the Albany Teacher’s soccer team,
coached by Jo Garcia, will play
Fordham University this Saturday
at 2 pm. on Beverwyck to start off
another season.

Tuesday’s game saw Albany hold
the Williams College crew to a 4-4
tie. The Pedagogues scored in the
second, third and fourth quarters,
with goal checks being placed oppo-
site the names of Al Rocklein, Al
Lederman, and John Lindberg (2).

The Feds will go to the fore this
Saturday minus the playing of Bill
Bonesteel. who will be benched with
an injured leg, and last year’s bril-
liant goalie, John Pengelly who is
nursing a bad finger. In practice
and scrimmage sessions, much hope
will be bestowed on Ralph Adams,
who has shown great defensive play
in the backfield, and the Lindberg
brothers. Bill and John, who have
displayed their typical brilliant fast
ball play.

Seek Eleven Straight

The State aggregation will be de-
fending a ten game home winning
streak, and trying to equal or bet-
ter their last year‘s record of 8 wins
and only 2 losses. With a returning
crop of John Lindberg, All Ameri-
can. and Rocklein, Ledei'man, and
Bill Lindberg, All State, Garcia sets
his hopes high.

This year will also see return-
big players Tito Guglielmone, "Reb-
el“ Hockmuth, Don Canonica, Wei-
erniiller, and Phil Billings. Frosh
turnouts have yielded Nils Briska,
Larry Culvert, Paul Daininer, Waf-
ren Dunhain, Bill Gron. Pol) £11111-
EI-lc Klppem non Leirinoe, John
McQupev, and Doug Posekraus.

AD the Fordhain U. game Satur-
day everyone should be on hand to
lend moral support to our players.
As it is scheduled part of Activities
Day, there should be quite a bit of
excitement on the field, and on the
sidelines.

Rica/u} Noted

On Saturday morning, October 9.
the Red Devils will grapple with the
novice Blue Jays on the softball
field the first of the scheduled
rivalry events. The men's clash and
the women‘s tussle will be worth 2
points apiece. Cheering from the
lusty lungs will constitute 1 presci-
ous point. Sophomore practice has
been scheduled for Tuesday and
Thursday at 4:00 pm. on Bever-
wyck. Sophomores are also remind-
ed to keep on the lookout for the
football signup sheet.
