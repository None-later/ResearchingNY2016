Our Policy . . .

It is at this point in the school year that
it comes time to present the reader with
statements concerning the operation of the
News and a few aspects of the editorial pol-
icy. The action is promulgatedﬁmore direct-
ly by the receipt of a communication ad-
dressed to your editor. First let the fact be
introduced that the News is entirely stu-
dent owned and managed, with no faculty
or administrational supervision. The edi-
torial policy of the paper is determined by
the editor in conjunction with the opinions
and sentiments of the News Board. The
latter group is compiled of the heads of the
various departments of this publication. It
falls upon these students to decide import-
ant issues, in addition to other managerial
duties, brought before them by the Board
chairman, the Editor-in-Chief. The Board
is more than a mere advisory agency, it rep-
resents the newspaper in its totality.

Recently the News Board, in a unanimous
vote, decided to replace the writers of one
of the weekly columns. The incident was
handled in a manner which was felt to be
just and expedient, and the resulting ac-
tion meritous of the intentions of those in-
volved, irregardless of what finally did ap-
pear in print. Columns appearing in this
paper have a freedom of expression denied
to the regular news writer; a great deal
more responsibility is left to the author. It
is expected that this sense of responsibility
will be shouldered by the columnists. It is
not the aim or purpose of the individual
who has final say to censor such columns,
providing basic journalistic standards are
maintained. But, a line has to be drawn
somewhere, and this particular decision was
not made by one individual, nor on the spur
of the moment, but after due consideration
by a group cognizant of the ideals to be
maintained, and the repercussions which
could be involved. That which has happen-
ed in the past certainly does not always dic-
tate what will occur in the present or
future. A word of caution or the like from
higher up is not made public knowledge of
course, and should definitely not even need
be necessitated. Before the issue in ques-
tion was released the News Board had con-
vened to issue an initial decision, the final
one resulting from a subsequent meeting,
after the entire situation had been thor-
oughly reviewed.

As for a definition of the extent of
the power of the Board, let it suffice
to state that it is supreme in matters
concerning any phase of this publication,
arising from anything printed therein or
resulting therefrom.

Quad column

By CLIFF DAVIS

 

"Monday, December '7, Betty Mar-
got was elected Sports Director of
Sayies.“ That was in 1945. A long
time in the forgotten past—and a
notice of no concern to the present
classes on campus. But at least it
stands as a paradox of the changing
times of our compact, intimate so-
ciety at State. Yes. if you peek
through the pigeon-hole of bygone
days your eyes would see many
wonderful events in evidence that
today are unknown, only ghosts of
State's past history.

Yet, one thing has remained and
recurred over and over, never fai-
tering, even up to this year, 1954.
i speak of M.A.A.'s inglorious strug-
gle for existence and the dilemma
directly brought about.

I, as a member of this year's
Council, would like to use the privi-
lege of this column in showing the
sincerity of our aims with the “re-
habilitation projejct of M.A.A.”

Never was the Association in a
position to exert the “full blast”
plan that we presently offer. Look
back, friends. I delved into old SCT
NeWs’s. They were constantly cur-
rying stories of bickering on lack
of equipment, the ominous lack of
interest, and. in 1945, the lack of
men.

That year M.A.A. could consider
the potential manpower to be in
the ninety male students enrolled.
Not much to work on. Today there
is close to fifteen times as many
men.

To the Editor:

State College students have always
been active in the field of enter-
tainment, but usually their endeav-
ors have gone no further than the
Page Hail stage. This year we have
the opportunity to widen our scope
by increasing our entertainment
program for the Veteran's Adminis-
tration iiospitiil. Our pnst Work in
this field has been greatly appreci-
iitcd and. consequently, we have
been linL‘d to lnltliite ii. definite
program which Would include sev-
eral groups.

Music Council und Driinnitics and
Arts Ail'iliutes extend il sincere iii-
vitiition to all students interested
in the program und willing to devote
an occasional hour. There is n
:lll'i‘liil need ior mule and female
singers, of both popular iind classi-
cul music; record puntoiulmisis;
unigiciuns; comedians; diiiicers; iii-
stiumci'tulists; nnd MC's or disc
Jockeys. iii iiie near future there
Will be ii bulletin board ilViIllilllli‘,
ior :ign-up sheets, notices, etc. in
tin.- iiicuniimc please (:Olllitift eitlicr
iiurbui'u Muriiiinc or Lisn iliiri-
inigci by student mnii.

'l‘iie llccd in urgent and the time
is now!

Sincerely,
Barbara Murnano
Lisa llurtnagel

Has the enrollment sneaked up on
the back of M.A.A. and become too
much a burden for the four mem-
bers? ABSOLUTELY NOT. An ad—
mittance like that would be disas-
trous for the Council. Contrariwise,
we are at our peak; Student Body
and Student Council have rellt the
spark in M.A.A. The Association is
restoring its integrity, its capabil-
ity. its compatibility to function
with Student Government. We of
Council are one against the world;
all men and organizations must
prove their worth before recogni-
tion of merit is granted. Therein
lies our goal.

Let’s not kid ourselves. Trial and
error must still enter the picture.
Tournament basis competition ush-
ers in the participation barriers.
Badminton, archery, rifle club and
fencing must “play the field" until
we know definitely how much sup-
port will comc. The mainstays——
football, basketball, etc—no Council
ever had to bother about.

Remember, Statesman. we're a
professional school. Competition,
scholastically, is far more tempered
thiin sports will ever be at this col-
lege. Small schools are small be-
cause they simply don’t cater to
theflotsam and jetsam who go to
college ior the kicks of the venture.
Most of us here are a different breed
of individual. Athletics, therefore,
must be secondary. On that out-
look, M.A.A. will ulwuys have to
struggle!

Be frank with the truth. Some of
us just weren't born for the inte-
grated body-contact sports. Co-
ordination takes training; college is
a late date to initiate that training.
But, at our disposal are activities
on ii more social level. They need
not be enumerated here.

Come out for the tourneys and
league sports, freshmen and upper~
clussmcn! Boost our program. You
are the key; we're the lock. Every—
thing in the iM agenda of sports is
competitive now. The points and
awards system has received n thor-
ough wliitewnshing. Your cil‘orts in
toiiriieys and lengues will no longer
go to naught. Re-iipproprintion in
tile awurds line oi the budget will
boost llie expenditure for awards to
$150 Commissioners in respective
leagues are keeping i)i'ttUi’-tlillil-CV(.’l'
records of each man's participation
in games. inventory and check-out
systems deiiiniidcd by SC are under
way.

if the cries for ii. better Associa—
tion are lieurd this your, tiicii so
Will thcy echo through the coming
yours. The sense of this is: Don’t
under-estimate or under—rule it
good deal like M.A.A. it's n neces-
sary function iii. State. The entire
1M schedule would be thrown
aground without il guiding light,

'l'i'hln requisite ior cnndldiites to
M.A.A. offices Will be stil'icned this
ycui‘, Wiiich only subsiulltintcs the
fact that we wont Council to be
internally stable in the future.

Elect a good i’reslimiiii representa-
tive.

BLUE, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, 0R PURPLE?

The idea brought up in this week’s Student Council
meeting about changing the color of the frosh beanies
seems to be a controversial one, judging by the vote
taken at the meeting. The whole core of the prob-
lem centers around the question of whether the tradi-
tional head-gears are class beanies or college beanies.
We feel strongly that they are class beanles. They
play an important role in Rivalry, which is a vital
part of State College tradition, and foster class spirit.
Some argue that the beanies should be purple and
gold to create college spirit. But we ask, how can you
have good college spirit when there is nothing unit-
ing each class?

Since the opponents of this suggestion say that
the beanies represent the college and should be pur-
ple and gold, the logical conclusion would be that
the class banners and Moving-Up Day regalia should
be purple and gold also.

Let's think about this when the question comes up
in Assembly today. The Seniors can remember when
tradition really meant something at State, and we
would like to see class-colored beanies return!
ENCORE . . .

Looks like our Soccer Team is getting ready for a
repeat performance again this year. The pep rally in
last Friday's assembly started the ball rolling and the
team took over from there. Keep up the good work,
and good luck this weekend.

A GRIPE . . .

We felt sorry for the “poor soul" behind the Snack
ar Saturday right, after the place was invaded by the
thirsty crowd that had participated in the Snake
Dance.

Knowing that the Activities Day Dance was to be
held in the Game Room, why wasn't more help avail-
able at this time?

It was ridiculous to see live workers behind the
Snack Bar just talking Sunday night when we all had
to wait twenty minutes to get a coke Saturday night.

Is the Snack Bar really this bad off?

NlillL‘.’

We have a feeling that something must be drastic-
ally wrong on campus. Isn’t there anything exciting
happening—no news? What happened to the good
old "high point of personal privilege,” and the heated
debates that went on in assembly? Let’s hope that
today's assembly changes this situation.
lNTRA-MURALS . . .

This year, MAA is offering a bigger and better
Intra-lViural sports program. Right now its program
is wider and more sports are being considered. Here
is an excellent opportunity for those interested in this
type of activity, so why not take advantage of it.
How about more enthusiastic and zealous men com-
ing out to make this program a bigger success.
EXPRESSION . .

of Sincere thanks for a job well done on Activities
Day to its chairman. The new idea of having the
fresh orientated before signing up for activities less—
ened the confusion and uncertainty of what organi-
zations each should join. Too bad that not more of
the fresh showed up. Was it due to the lack of pub-
licity for this affair, or just an uninterested class?
Keep in mind that no campus organization can get
along without new try-outs.

SOl’llS—WHA HOPPENED?

The faces of the Red Devils should be red after
what took place on Page stage last Saturday night.
Speaking of harmless productions, this was the best
yet. if this is an indication of what the Sophs plan
to do during the coming year, the frosh should have
no trouble winning Rivalry.

Tin-BITS . . .

Been having trouble understanding your profs these
past few days? . . . must be due to the [net that there
is construction going on . . . wonder just how long
the poor instructors are going to have to shout their
heads oil to combat the cement mixers, drills. etc? . . .

it's sort of u coincidence that ii. fraternity has
scheduled an open house for this weekend so that
we all have the op-"pur1"‘-tunity to see their latest
addition.

Glad to see that people are flnully getting hep
and are having their pictures taken . . . Think the
photographer dcscrves it big “thaiik-you.... for being
so patient with us and consenting to stay . . . Just
hope that those who haven't yet been photographed
luirry up and do so.

QUESTIONS OF THE WEEK . . .

Who stole the Sophs' red lights?

Whose male voice is overheard in one of Bru’s
activity rooms saying, "Please take off your blouse"?

Who is this week’s Cumpused Queen?

English Instructors
To Administer
Grammar Test

Students To Report To
Draper 349, Oct. 19

The English Department will ad-
minister the Grammar Test at 10 '
am, October 19, in Draper 349. The
English Department requests the
following three groups to consider
this academic obligation. '

The following groups should re-
port to Draper 349 at 10 am. on
October 19:

i. The ten upperciassmen who
took English 1A, Remedial, last
semester (Spring ’54) and who have
not yet passed the standard gram-
mar test;

2. The present Sophomores who
took regular En 1A last semester
and whose grades are listed as "In-
complete," because they did not pass
the grammar test;

3. Those freshmen, whether they
are taking En 1A or have still to
take it. whose entrance examination
did not include the forty"- ﬁve
minute, standard test in grammar,
punctuation, spelling.

Failure of these students to ap-
pear at the indicated time will con-
stitute a defaulting of the one
opportunity for clearing the test
this semester, according to Frances
Colby, Associate Professor of Eng-
lish. The test will not be given in
the present En 1A sections until
January. The only "first try” of the
present semester for those who must
repeat the test will be October 19.
Results of the test will be available
in Richardson 32, October 25.

Students in the first tWo groups
lirlUII ubuvc will be contacted in-
dividinilly. Freshmen who are un-
sure whether thcy have taken the
test inny check with Mrs. Thomson
in Lll‘ Student Personnel Office.
