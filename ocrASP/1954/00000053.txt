Social Studies, and published by the
State Education Department.

To the Editor:

Now that the tremencious storm
of student indignation concerning
the highly irregular column which
appeared in the September 24 edi—
tion of the State College New has
died down, we should like very
much to venture our opinion coli-
cerning same.

From what we could gather being
talked about dilrlng lllost of the
colfee breaks was not So much the
bad taste of the two writers who
shall be nameless but rather the
bad taste of the News Board in
handling the case. And we are very
lnuch ill agreement with the feel-
ings of the majority.

1n the lirst place, we doubt very
lnuch if ninety per-cent of the stu-
dent population would cver havve
neticed the irregularity in the Com—
mon—Stator if their attention had
not been called to it by the firing
of its two authors. And this sort
of thing is not Without precedent.
A glance at the February 15. 1952
issue of the News may refresh your
memory. In it you will fiiid the
same sort of offense. Aiid as for
“bad taste," personally neither of
uus iii four years have ever seen
anything in worse taste than a cer-
tain cartoon appearing in one of
liiSt year's iSsues of the News. Yet
no one was fired for that, and no
one was replaced for offenses simi—

State. The exhibition is composed
of original waterolor paintings by
H. Wayne Trimm of the New York
State Conservation Department.

According to Robert Burgess,
Chairman of the Librarianship De-
partment, the Library Department
and CASDA are planning on all day
conference of student assistants in
libraries and library clubs in the
area. The conference is scheduled
for November 3 at Brubaeher Hall.

Edwin C. Munro, Assistant Pro-
fessor of Modern Languages, has
announced that a conference on the
teaching of ioreign languages in el-
ementary schools Will be held on
Saturday, November 6, at 10 am. at
State. The program will include:
Registration at 10 am; a Speaker
at 10:20 a.m.; a Demonstration Class
at 11:15: a panel and discussion at
11:30 (the panel will include one
classroom teacher; one parent; one
school board member; one language
teacher) and a luncheon is sched-
uled for 1 pm.

Alice T. Hastings, Assistant Col-
lege Librarian, has announced that
the International Film Group has
an exhibit iii the Library Showcase
in the hawley Library.

 

lar to this in past Common-Staters.

Granted two wrongs don‘t make
a right, but one mistake on the part
of two fine people doing an excel-
lent job just doesn't seem to war—
rant their expulsmn, no matter how
you look at it. It leads people to
believe there must have been some-
tlnng more behind it. It certalniy
Was. in our opinion, a very super-
ficial excuse for such drastic action.

This incident and several other
bits of llliUl'llliltlllll gathered from
reliable sources make us wonder
also just how iliiich say the News
Board has on what goes in thc
Common-Slater. 'lhis has always
been a column of unbiased SLLl(lt‘liL
opinion, renecting iiotlillig whatso-
ever oi the policies of the News
Board. It is the only medium for
airing of genuine student gripes this
college has, except for tile gi'lipe-
vine winch oiteli is not. too factual.

umn must be looked over and re-
viscd somewhat so that it comes up
to ethical standards, we would hate

Council Selects
New Committees

(Continued from Page 1. Column 5)

Junior member of the All-College
Revue Committee, and that Olina
Fusco ‘56 has accepted the ap-
pointment as Class Auditor.

At this point in the meeting, the
president called for a “good of the
order" discussion. Joseph Kelly ’56
suggested that the agenda for each
Council meeting be announced at
the beginning of the ineetlng in
order that members can limit dis-
cussion to allow time to discuss all
issues to be considered.

Betscha suggested that a parlia-
mentarian for Council be appointed
to cut out extraneous discussion
but the members of Council decided
by a straw vote to leave this mat-
ter to the discretion of the presi-
dent.

ary Ann Johnpoll ’55 announced
that Dr. Evan R. Collins, President
of the College, has assured the All-
College Revue Committee that either
Page stage or a stage comparable
in size will be available when the
performance is scheduled to be pre-
sented. The committee plans to ask
for $350 froin surplus to fliiance the
show. BCLSCIlil moved that the
money be borrowed from surplus and
that tickets be sold for the revue
so that the loan can be paid back
to surplus. This motion was passed.

Myskaniii has suggested that Stu-
dent Coiiiitil wait. until alter the
Campus Dliy skit before they select
freshman rcprcscntatives to the
All-College Home Committee so that
it will be easier to select. freshmen
who would desire and be capable of
serving on the committee. Council
agreed to follow this suggestion al-
though no formal motion was made.

Bcckwilh rciid a lctlcr from the
Inter-Collegiate Association. The
ICA Conference will be held in
Gciicsco this yciir and has been
tentatively scheduled for December
3 and Li. Nomination for represent—
atives to this conference will be

from these nominations Student
Coiiilcil will elect the four repre-
scnlntives.

A committee consisting of Dix’on,
Mnrjojl'ic Kcllclicr, and Joan DcCic-

out what will be done with banners
of graduating classes.

Dixon will present a iiioiloii to SA

3M .‘LuA WW

By JOE SWIERZOWSKI

 

With the Albany weatherman fin-
ally giving his O.K., Coach Garcia
and his men made a fine showing
of themselves at rain-soaked Bev-
erwyck Field last Saturday. The
Lindberg brothers, as usual, came
through in fine fashion. Phil Bill-
ings played a fine defensive game
as did freshman, Paul Dammer.
Tito Guglielmone, filling in the
big shoes of John Pengelly, did a
superb job as goalie. In fact, not
one of the fourteen men who saw
action can be overlooked. The vic-
tory was the result of long hours of
practice, and high team spirit.
Speaking of spirit, the student body
turned out fairly well. As all those
who saw the game will agree. State
has a powerful team and deserves
much more support. At the next
home encounter, we'd like to see an
even bigger turnout. At this time,
perhaps, Ped soccer rooters may
get their first seasonal glimpse of
John Pengelly and Bill Bonesteel,
fast on the road to recovery.

Something that's been brought to
our attention and something we've
very unhappy to write about is the
poor attitude I.M. game officials
are taking in regards to their
responsibilities. Several games this
week were played without board
ofﬁcials. In these cases, the
poorly prepared “pick- ups." al-
though glvlng their best efforts,
nevertheless were mediocre in rela-
tion to the trained board members.
This is not intended to be a knock
at those who were asked (and gen-
erously did) give up their time to
oﬁiclate. but rather as a. reminder
to the board ofﬁcials to check the
bulletin boards for their assign—
ments and show up. Their poor at-
titude reflects on M.A.A., which does
not deserve the knocks.

Another unfortunate circumstance
occurred this week when the home
team at an I.M. game was held re-
sponsible for a lost football. They
were assessed for it and we hope no
"mysterious losses" 01 any nature
should occur.

Sport Shorts

Something that strikes us pretty
hard also is the refusal by AA. to
appropriate money for the so-eiilled
"State Aggregation" bowlers. Since
we “cried” over this same issue last
year we'll just pass it over. but in
passing we'd like to say that per-
haps the group's efforts to promote
better relations among district col-
leges iCVCll at their own expense
and time) will be brought to light
in the years to come.

The action likewise will throw the
I.M. bowling organization out of
gear as five of the six keglcrs coli-
stitute ll team that last year won
the loop championship.

Within two or three weeks we're
looking forward to doubling our
sports stuff. In the male cnrollniciil
at the News cub classes iirc Nor-
man Koslofsky. Plilllp Latimcr, Elli-
iiiett Teli Broeck. and Larry Culver,

to join us.

es to Fox for live morc. Strauber

first in the 2nd quarter on a pass
from lezi to Patton from one yard
out. after a 50-yard pass from
