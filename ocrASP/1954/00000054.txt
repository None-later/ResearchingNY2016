Reading Series

The Oral Interpretation Class, un-
der the direction of Agnes E. Fut-
terer, Professor of English, is pre-
senting a series of four evenings
of readings from literature.

The evening's. commencing Octo-
ber 19. will be held at the college
in Draper 349 every other week at
8 pm.

Each member of the mass will
give a reading during the eight
weeks. The programs will be chosen
with adaptability to oral presenta-
tion in mind, states Marjorie Jelley
'57. There will be a variety in the
selection of material. Miss Jelley re-
ports, ranging from “Alice in Won-
derland" to the dramatic mono-
logue. “The Defense of Guinevere."

During the second semester the
class will present a series of read—
ing in drama.

 

In the Boston University NeWS
we read that the males on campus
are complaining because they have
to sign out girls like library books.

It also seems that BU harbors a
champion girls' rifle team. This
sounds forbidding, to say the least.

A University of Texas Prof coin-
mented: “The trouble with a fellow
who thinks he can read women like
a book is he's always forgetting
his place."

From the Daily Lobe (!?i. Univer-
sityof New Mexico:

He asked me: “When?”—

I could not tell.

He queried: “Who?”

Again I fell.

He named a man

To me a stranger.

And I could see

Myself in danger.

What was this plight—

thls mystery
Oh! Just my course in History.
The lthaean, a couple of weeks

ago. ran a very logical headline—
“Frcshmen Must Wear Beanies—-
Or Face Exposure." But Freshie,
think of the consequences.

Thomson To Lead

Upperclassmen
Reading Classes

Those upperclassmen who wish
to improve their personal reading
should leave their names with Fran-
ces K. Thomson, Personnel Instruc-
tor and Associate of the Student
Personnel Services.

The first class in reading lin-
provcment will meet at 4 pm. in
Millie 121 on Monday. A series of
eight meetings is planned. All in-
terested students, including those
who are not free at this time,
should leave their names with Mrs.
Thomson.

Two other reading groups are
planned this year, one for fresh-

men, in February and another for
upper-classmen in March. No out—
side work will beniecessary, al-
though progress is usually mor ra-
pid if one hour per week outside
the regular class can be devoted to
reading.

Students will find this class in
reading will aid in their speed and
also find that their comprehension
rate will improve.
