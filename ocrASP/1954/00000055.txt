 

Needed Powers . . .

During the past couple weeks Myskania and Campus
Commission have been putting their heads together in
an attempt to discover some means to add more power
and prestige to the latter. Owing to the fact that at
present the Commission has no power to enforce any
of its regulations, to speak frankly, efforts to correct
this shortcoming were initiated. Since the adminis-
tration feels that the students should assume the re-
sponsibility of handling such matters, within their
limits, the Commission has a tentative system of
steps it may take to indicate those “students” who
continually misuse student property and facilities.
Presently the Commission is amending the by-laws
of its constitution to include a listing of major and
minor offenses. Under this set-up the News will carry
a listing of those offenders who initially commit twa
minor offenses or one major offense, as designated by
these by-laws, and as submitted to the paper by
Campus Commission. If this is not sufficient to dis-
courage further violations, Myskania is investigating
its own power, to determine whether it may penalize
habitual offenders by taking away certain of the
privileges offered to a member of student Associa-
tion, as a holder of a Student Activity Card. Sent-
ences from this judicial body, if so empowered, would
enable it to negate some of these privileges, i.e., the
receipt of college publications, admittance to various
functions, etc. And thirdly, if the foregoing are not
sufficient to serve the purpose, Campus Commission
and we ourselves feel that the administration should
take over at this point. It would be quite evident
that student action had about run its limits. The
penalty at this stage should be temporary suspen-
sion, the maximum. We ask you again, is all this
necessary? We have shown you in a previous issue,
by photograph, an example of typical violations, and
we attempted to impress on you the need for a little
effort and co-operation on your part. Again we sug-
gest, we urge, that you heed the rules, especially in
light of these latest developments. Campus Commis-
sion does not intend to function as a police agency,
let us not make it such.

Compulsory Assemblies. . .

Since attendance will be taken in Assembly today
(be sure to check the Assembly seating charts) the
question arises, “What happens if I do not go to As-
sembly?" Frankly, the answer at present is nothing.
However, let us inform you that the committee on
Student Council in charge of Assembly planning, is
presently investigating the possibilities of securing
speakers and other entertainment, amounting to the
scheduling of paid asmmblies. This is an attempt to
make assemblies more interesting. We want them,
the need is evident, and has been for quite some time.
As to enforcing compulsory assemblies, Student Coun-
cil passed this problem on to Myskania. Here again,
penalties have been discussed, ranging from the pos-
sibilities of depriving an SA member of the right to
vote, administrational handling of the case, to the
previously discussed penalty of denying certain of
the privileges offered by the Student Activity Card.
It all boils down to the same thing . . . students do
not care, whether it be an infraction of a Campus
Commission rule, or complete indifference to school
government. We believe some serious thinking is due
on your part, too, and behavior relevant to the ful-
fillment of your obligations. Keep in mind who set
up all these rules, and also made assemblies com-
pulsory.

By the hundreds they came. Tired
taught faces mirrored their antici-
pation of the great battle that was
to come. They mobbed Page Hall,
entirely oblivious to the pleading
Campus Commission members, fight-
ing for the few seats that were
available. No one wanted to miss the
oratory that was about to take place
on this earth shaking project. This
question was, “Shall we change the
color of the beanie from purple and
gold to the four class colors?"

Finally, the president‘s gavel re-
sounded and a bush fell over the
assembly as the ﬁrst speaker took
the floor and presented the motion.
As the last words of the motion re-
verberated from Page, pandcmoni—
inn broke loose. Throughout the
hall small groups huddled together
and an angry murmur arose from
certain quarters. Copies of the State
College News dropped to the ﬂoor
and a sea of hands arose, all anx-
ious to be recognized to express
their feelings and the opinions of
their coup.

Again frenzy ruled the masses. As
the SA president calmly brought
the group to order, the first of the
many orators arose. The starting
gun of the campaign was fired. One
by one the speakers arose and pre-
sented their arguments. Cheers and
a quiet huzzah arose following each
golden gush of information.

As the discussion proceeded, many
things became evident. In the eyes
of many it appeared that the de-

baters, were of factions. those who
knew what the issue was, and those
who did not. Angry voices stated
the issue  “school spirit vs. class
spirit," others chided the issue at
State, was “technicolor Moving-Up
Days.”

The discussion moved on, and it
was uppermost in cvcryonc's mind
the import and the gargantuan mo-
mentovsness of the move. In the
course of the debate it was brought
out the gigantic margin of 8 to 7
by which Student Council okayed it
in one of their momentous meetings.

The piece dc resistance occurred
when one faction introduced Exhib-
it A. a fresh chapeau showing that
State College is recognized by a
minute S on the fore. This was rap-
idly countered by Exhibit B, an-
other frosh helmet with class nu-
merals on the front. In the course
of discussion it was brought out that
the same beanie could be retained
with neon letters for class recogni-
tion. It was pointed out that this
might start a trend where the var-
sity basketball players will wear
class colors.

The highlight came when a l'rosh
raised his hand and paraphrased
the impartial State College News on
the issue.

At this time, feeling the clutches
of Morpheus, I decided that I should
rctire, rather than listen to the
continuation of the resume on the
assembly which I couldn't attend.

To the Editor:

Many of the interested upper—
classmcn of our school, people who
are interested in maintaining and
cnlivening school spirit, seem to be
quite concerned with the very small
factor of class beanics lo the innin-
tenancc and thriving of school spir—
it. It would seem that school spirit
seldom, if every, is dependent upon
the color of class bcunics. It would
also appear that it will take more
than class beanies and their class-
dcfining colors to reconstruct the

“THE MAN ON CAMPUS

school sporit which once was.

True, there is u need for and a
use for rivalry on thc part of stu-
dcnis at our college. But certainly,
school spirit does he dccpcr than
a cap or color. It is that dccpci‘
cause for which we must scorch if
We are to over reconstruct that
school spirit which is reminiscent of
our Scnior's frcslnnan your.

Respectfully,
Arnold E. [Simon ‘55.

IIOMECOMING

Tomorrow at our second annual Homecoming Week-
end we will have the chance to see our long lost
alums. This weekend was initiated last year and
we’re hoping it will become another "tradition" here
at State. Let's all attend the activities planned for
the day and, above all . . . don‘t forget the “tea party"
at Herbert’s.

INTERIOR DECORATING

Will someone please answer just one question for
us? Why wasn’t the Commons painted at some time
when so many people wouldn't have been inconveni-
enced? The way it is now, it's just too bad if you
have a twelve and a one o’clock class. The place is
so mobbed from 12:50 to 1:50 pm. that it takes you
10 minutes to get one foot over the threshhold. It
seems to us that the mailboxes could be put on tables
in the hall outside the Richardson locker-room until
the Commons is reopened.

ASSEMBLY

Hope everyone has checked the Assembly Seating
Lists by now and will trip over to Page to find his
or her personalized seat. Let’s have a full house every
Friday from now on—lasi year we voted to have
compulsory assemblies—we wanted themII—so let's
attend. We felt that if there had been more people
in assembly last Friday, a few things would have
been different.

LAUDE ‘

Congratulations to the Soph girls and frosh men on
winning their respective Rivalry softball games last
Saturday. The Sophs' pop band and snazzy cheering
outfits showed their tremendous spirit.
UNCOMMENDABLE

Though sorority rushing has not “officially” begun,
there is an undertone present in the favorite spots
around campus. Girls, “It's too early to start ‘sharp—
ening your axcs’.” Why not give the fresh a chance
to really see what the other groups are like. Don‘t
let insincei'ity overlap with State's reputation for
friendliness.

MISCELLANEOUS

Hey Galsi! It seems that we have a new Mambo
King on campus. He can usually be found “tripping
the light fantastic" to the tune of "Papa Loves
Mambo" every afternoon in the Game Room .
This semester, in order to replace the A. D. Plays, the
Oral interpretation class will present Readings of
Literature. Their first reading will be Tuesday night
in Draper 349. The A. D. pliin had good attendance
last year and we hope that the frosh and upperclasu-
men will attend these readings as well as they did
the plays , . . We recommend the well—dressed male
to stop in Room 147 New Draper to see the display
of “Fabric and Fashion." The real collegiate guy
will appreciate these new styles set up by the Distrib-
utive Education Workshop.

SOMETHING NEW

That room in lower Draper isn't a new branch of
Macy's basement . . . it's just the rejuvenated Co-op.
Thanks to the new manager, things don't seem to
be in a confused state as they were in previous years.
Just one suggestion M how about handing out floor
plans of the new arrangement? Onc poor soul wan
in to buy an article between classes and it took her
ten minutes to find what she was looking for.
QL‘ESTION OI“ THE WEEK?

Anyone for returning coke bottles and coffee cups
to their proper places?

To Participate

In Conference

’News’ Members Leave
For Washington Meeting

The annual Associated Collegiate
Press convention, to be held next
Thursday and Friday at the Hotel
Statler in Washington, D. C., will
be attended by four delegates from
State College News. Announcement
of the conference was received from
Fred L. Kildow, Director of the na-
tional organization. This is the ﬁrst
year that the conference has taken
place near enough to Albany for
State to participate despite bud-
get restrictions.

The News representatives who will
lcave Wednesday are: Ronald Lack-
cy '55; Joseph Swieraowski ’57;
Carol Aim Luft and Aileen Coch-
iane, Juniors. Last year 140 schools
in 37 states sent 600 students to
the convention. Until this year State
delegates have been attending the
Columbia Scholastic Press Associa-
tion conferences at Columbia Uni-
vcrsity.

The Associated Collegiate Press
Short Course and Conference con-
sists of lectures and group discus-
sions on such journalistic subjects
as Make-up, Typography, Editorial
writing, Feature writing, News re~
porting, the Sports page, and the
Business and Administration Sem-
inar. Also much of the conference
will be devoted to publications pho-
tography with A. L. HerLouw, Ed-
ucational Consultant in Photogra-
phy for Eastman Kodak Co., pre-
siding.

ACP has been serving college pub-
lications since 1933. Previously, the
National Scholastic Press ASSOC‘ ia-
iion provided valuable advice, criti-
cism, and suggestions. However,
since 1933. the NSPA has concen-
trated more on the high school
field of join'naiism.
