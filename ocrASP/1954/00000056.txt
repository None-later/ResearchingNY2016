Marjorie Kelleher '56 told the
Council that it was decided to give
the class banners to the alumni
chairman for that class to be used
in their activities.

Walter Barbash '55 asked Council
for its opinion on the possible
change in the State College mascot.
It was presented that the present
emblem is not very well accepted by
the teams and lacks recognition in
the student body. Council recom-
mended ihat Varsity Club continue
on its plans to select the three
best emblems submitted and then
take them before Student Associa—
tion for final selection. Along the
same line Custer Quick ‘56 an-
nounced that Athletic Association
Board had approached Dr. Collins
on the possibility of changing the
school colors. They were told that
there is sentiment in State Univer-
sity system to have all State colleges
have blue and gold colors, therefore
this would be the only possible
change.

Soccer Squad Encounters
Oswego State Tomorrow

Roecklein, Bill
Lindberg Score
In Ped Victory

Coach Garcia and his Ped booters
play host tomorrow to Oswego State
Teachers College in a soccer game
at Beverwyck Field. The game,
scheduled to get under way at 2
o’clock, will feature the afternoon
program of Homecoming Weekend.

A series of injuries has somewhat
dimmed the hopes of State soccer
fans. Paul Dammer and Ralph
Adams will probably be sitting on
the bench with heavy colds as will
Bill Bonesteel and John Fengelly,
out with injuries. John Lindberg,
another injured bootel', will be in
the starting line—up although he
will be hampered by a bad ankle.

Peds Beat Bridgeport

In last Saturday's game, State
overcame a fine defensive Bridge-
port team and very high winds to
emerge victorious. The final score
was 2-0.

The first score for State came at
4:10 of the second quarter on 1
penalty kick by Bill Lindberg.

The second and filial score of the
game came late in the third period
(17:451. Ev Weiennuller, one, of
State's finest hooters, passed the
brown sphere to Al “Rocky” Roeck—
lein who drove it into the wind—
blown ilct for the tally.

Adams and Dammer. State's scn-
ior fullback and freshman ccntcr
forward, were used sparingly in the
game because of their heavy colds.

Tito Guglielmonc, State‘s out—
standing goulie, turned in another
fine performance, being credited
with 11 sparkling saves. Also oni-
standing for State were Al Leder—
man, Phil Billings, and Ed Jones.
Co-Captain Don Cononica was like—
wise credited with n finc game dis—
playing bcnutiful footwork.

Short Passing Used

Because of the high winds Stutc
had to rely on it short passing game.
The teachers played the winds bcou'
tii‘uily and after it short time of
adjusting to it used it to i'ull ii(l-
vantage.

Conch Garcia credited the win to
the hustle of his players who seem-
ed to be all over the field.

ln Rivalry Event

A “boner” play in the final in-
ning of play gave the freshman soft-
ball team a 9-8 win over the Sophs
in last Saturday’s Rivalry game.
With a runner on third, Joe Swier-
zowski, the Sophs catcher, chased
out to first base on an infield pop up
leaving home plate unguarded and
making it nothing more than a mere
formality for the winning run to
cross home plate.

The Blue Jays cause was helped
tremendously in the fourth when
Harry Millet hit a tremendous grand
slam deep to the foot of Sayles
Hall.

Bob Backer started for the Jays
on the mound followed by Gerry
Birr, the eventual winner. John
“Hoot” Stefano, the freshman soft-
ball director who did a tremendous
job, caught the offerings of the
hurlers. Dan Miller started for the
Sophs followed by Jiln Lockhart, the
loser.

The football contest, second ill the
series of men's athletic events, will
be played tomorrow at Dorm Field.

Wrestling. which in the past few

in State's vast sports program, will
be in the infant stages of organiza-

The sport ran on a club basis last
year was under the supervision of
Coach Joe Garcia. Garcia will run
the J.V. hoopsters this year and will
not have time to spend with the
gi‘upplcl‘s.

A sign-up sheet will be placed on

is usde to either sign up or get in

The Intramural Football League,
blessed with another week of fair

way mark in the schedule was
reached.

Last Thursday, the two games
played resulted in a close victory
for SIS and a romp for APA. SLS
ground out a win at the expense of
KB by a score of 6-0. The one score
of the game was made when Bob
Smith intercepted a pass and ran it
back 40 yards for a TD. KB’s de-
fense was sparked by the hard
charging line play of Carrera, Cuba,
and Reuss, while their offense con-
sisted largely of passes from Biatt-
man and Sturm. Shumanskl and
Small led the SL8 forward line,
while the offense featured runs by
Neville. In the Dorm Field game,
AiPA completely outclassed a hustling
Van Derzee squad 38-0. Mullen and
Strauber each scored three touch-

Aggregation Bowlers
Triumph Over RPI

In Intercollegiate Bowling this
week the State Aggregation Bowlers
took over the Albany District loop
lead by downing RPI No. 2, 4-0.
State’s efforts were helped along
when RPI No. 1 was credited with
a four-point forfeit victory over
Hudson Valley Tech.

Tom Shumanski's consistent keg-
ling led the teachers in their second
week of match play. Big “Shu” came
up with a 171 opening single. He
finished his 526 triple with a 179
tally after coming up with a middle
game of 176. The statesmen looked
like a bunch of high school kids in
the first game as they nosed out
their opposition 740-736. Furious over
their poor showing the keglers
bounced back with 154 and 125-pin
margins in the closing games.

John Zidik backed up “Shu” in
scoring with 130-177-192 for a 499
thirty frame tally. Joe “Swizz”
Swicrzowski followed Zidik with 166-

downs, Strauber tallying once on a
recovered fumble in the end rune.
The other five 'I'D's were scored on
long runs behind crisp downfield
blocking by Dreher and Derwin.

Two of the powerhouses played
two of the weaker teams Monday,
with both 3 es turning out as ex-
pected. The rs, playing an under-
manned Sayles team were held
scoreless for almost three quarters
before finally crashing through for
a 20-0 victory. The Saylesmen
threatened several times in the first
half. However, Rookwood, behind
good blocking, finally ran for the
first two scores and threw to Pea-
cock for the final TD. Patton and
Anderson scored the extra points.
The sharp passing of Birr provided
most of the Sayles offensive punch
as he completed several to Millet;
Harvey and Brindrin stood out on
defense. On Dorm Field Potter was
defeating Van Derzee 26-0. Clear-
water scored two 'I'D's on passes,
while Krchniak and Baker each
scored one apiece. Krchniak and
Owens scored the extra points;
O'Loughlin and. Stephenson were
outstanding defensemen for the
club; Van Derzee's defense was bul-
warked by Duran, Woyton and Klob-
erdanz.
CH Downed, 6-0

SLS squeezed out its second 6-0
victory in a row Tuesday beating
College Heights. The only score of
the game came on a pass from
Willi to Neville. Shumanskl and
Cassevoy were outstanding in hot-
tling up the barracks boys, although
Dempster did manage to gain some
ground behind good blocking by
Morgan. Zaccaro and Hunt sparked
the College Heights defense. Sayles
forfeited to Potter in the other
scheduled game.

In a game which may have gone
a long way toward deciding the
championship in the A League, APA
pinned the first defeat on the 69ers
7-0. The one TD was scored when
Duprey intercepted a pass and
handed off to Strauber who ran
into the end zone.
