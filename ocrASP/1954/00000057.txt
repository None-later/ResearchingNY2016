Students To Take

First Grammar
Test Try Tuesday

The English grammar test will be
given Tuesday at 10 am in Draper
349 by the English Department. Stu-
dents doubtful of their status
should check the bulletin board out-
side the Student Personnel Oilice.‘

Owing to the limited Student Mull
facilities this week, it is important
for students to keep track of this
obligation for themselves. Attempts
to communicate with these students
may be delayed or unsuccessful,
states Francis Colby, Associate Pro-
fessor of English.

For those who must repeat the
test the try next week will replace
the former system whereby repeaters
took the test in any of the current
English 1A sections.

Mast of the present freshmen have
already taken this test once as part
of their entrance examinations in
September. The present sections will
therefore not be tested until near
the end of this term, in January. At
that time any people who received
incomplete grades in the Spring sem-
ester of mm and who still do not
pass the test next week will be
eligible for it final attempt. Thus,
failure to take the test 'I‘uesduy
constitutes ii forfeiture of one of the
remaining chances to clear the re-
qulrmlent.

Freshmen currently enrolled in
English 1A Will be tested or excused
in January according to the scores
already on record. Full information
will be given the. freshmen in each
section at it later date.

Rampant Wreckers
Confound Chords

Drills drive debaters daffy as
Music majors compose Jack-
hammer Jive.

Student insurance premiums
are bound to rise with the add-
ed risk of dodging pneumatic
drills, lead pipes and acetylene
torches. Strolling out of the back
door of Richardson affords the
pedestrian a chance for receiv-
ing an exhaust blast in the eye
while walking between flying
cement chips.

Beethoven's Fifth now has six
movements as the Music 4
classes attempt to appreciate
punctuated records. Shubert's
Unfinished Symphony has at
long last been furnished with a
classic ending -— by the con-
struction gang.

All this pandemonium is ac-
companied by lowered grades as
future teachers take up the hon-
orable trade of sidewalk super—
visors. Anyone for dodge ball?
