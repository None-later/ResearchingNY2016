Ereciting The Whip . . .

A few comments are in order after the
slightly over thirty minute Assembly in
Page last week. First, is it not a regulation,
in our student government, for a student
making a motion in Assembly, to have that
motion in writing and to present that mo-
tion to the Student Association president,
or the presiding officer, after the reading
of the motion? We feel that the “why” of
any motion should at least be explained by
the agency or individual concerned, even if
there is no discussion or questions from
the floor. Last week, parties requesting
financial allotments did not even have to
be in Assembly to obtain such! The decid—
ing factor in this case was that it was cus-
tomary to provide these funds! Secondly,
is it not the duty of the parliamentarian
of the Assembly to follow the order of buSI-
ness, and thereby keep abreast with the
progress of a motion on the floor? Whether
or not rulings seem boring, when the As-
sembly is in error legally it falls upon the
parliamentarian to so inform 1t, aswas
done. Technicalities should not be so light-
ly dismissed, they are basic to the conduct
of legal business. Thirdly, relative to the
making of announcements, either the par-
ties who signed up for announcements were
not in Assembly, or students making an-
nouncements stood corrected several times
on the exact and necessary details. Fourth-
ly, on the matter of apologies, it seems to
us Myskania and the SA president should
get together before the former releases
names to this publication of those to make
apologies in a particular assembly. Clear-
ance is required by one of the two on the
apology as it is to be presented, before a
freshman may come before the Assembly.
This is the season for apologies, therefore
let us get the procedure straightened out,
and have them, especially when notifica-
tion has been made through the ublishing
of the Assembly agenda. And fif hly, what
happened to Campus Commission? Has the
traditional row by row exit, according to
class, been abandoned? Enforcement of this
tradition should be made, especially since
there are freshmen seated downstairs. We
would like to call attention to the news
item appearing on front page, and urge
that other organizations consider utilizmg
Assembly time. What we want to do here
mainly is to urge that these various proce-
dures not be overlooked or inadequately
handled.

A Successiui Venture . . .

The issuance of the Student Activity
Cards seems to have highlighted the past
week. Strikingly neat in appearance, the
card also diSplays a fine job on the part
of the photographer. The card will serve
for purposes of identification, in addition
to regulating admission to the various col-
lege activities.

Have you ever heard of Mesopeta-
mia? Well, that is my country, which
is called Iraq. It is one of the Near
East Countries where people speak
the Arabic language. I come from
Baghdad. the capital and the biggest
city in Iraq—the city you probably
have read about in the "Thousand
and One Nights.”

I am sure you have heard or read
something about the Tigris and the
Euphrates. They are the two rivers
that water the lands of Iraq which
is a country of agriculture, well-
known for its dates, delicious dates
of one hundred and three kinds
that constitute the principal exports
of Iraq. besides oil, wheat, barley,
corn. wool. cotton, sheep, goats,
horses and cattle.

Five million people live in Iraq.
Their principal occupations are:
agriculture, oil, mining, commerce,

To the Editor:

Ever since we saw ll Hamilton-
RPI football game earlier this full.
we've been trying hard to dig up a
logical reason for the tlet‘llCC of a
grid team here at State. Neither
Hamilton nor RPI iltht' spectacular
football teams. They play good ball,
but they aren't going to set the
football-playing world on fire. We
figure we've got boys here at State
who can do just as well. Siatcsmcn
exhibit. all kinds of talcnt. prowess,
and spunk in intramural football
matches.

Thcrc are those who argue that
we haven't got the weight here at
State that's needed for a good, hard-
hltting line. The average weight of
the RPI line is 187 lbs. Hamilton
can't boast any boy-giants either.
Union's line averages out to l80.3.
Now you can’t tell us that we have
not got enough good, big. strong,
rod-blooded American boys here at
State to form a decent line! And
even if we couldn’t put seven 200
pounders out there on the line, we
could make up for it with spunk.

Three years of watching touch-
football on Beverwyck and Dorm
Field leaves us with the opinion
that we‘ve got some pretty good
running backs here at State. But
we've been told that one hardy
tackle would put the swifties in the
hospital. since they're fast but not
too big. There's a boy named Cline
on the RPI squad that seems to be
staying out of the hospital, and yet
he’s no bruiser. But. man, can he
run. If small backs can do it at
Hamilton, Union, and RPI, why
can’t they do it at State?

We've been told that a football
team at State would put our win—
hing soccer team on the rocks. We
fail to see the logic behind this
one. There are 686 men enrolled at
State College. From 686 men we
ought to be able to recruit a decent
football team without running com-
petition with the soccer team.

And if we did have a team. where
would they play? Rumor has it that
this problem can easily be dealt
With. It seems that there is state-
owned land behind the barracks Just
waiting to be converted into some-
thing useful like a football field.

M

trade, and financial professions.

Higher education as it now stands
is provided in separate colleges di-
rected towards education for the
different professions. These are the
Higher Teachers, the College of
Medicine, Pharmacy, Chemistry,
Law. Engineering. Commerce, Sci-
ence, and Arts Colleges. All these
colleges are co—cducritlonal except
two Tcachers' Colleges for Women
and one Teachers‘ College for Men
only. The Tcnchcrs' College comes
nearest to a liberal arts college of
the American type which combine
academic and .professional educa-
tloii as American colleges often do.
The Medical College which was es-
tablished on the grounds of the big-
gest hospitals in Baghdad in 1924.
provides the only medical training
available in Iraq. New students to
:1“ colleges are selected on the basis
of the public secondary school ex-
amination results, geographical dis-
tribution, age, personal interviews,
medical examination, and a special
oral and written examination. Tui-
tion is free to all students who
sign a contract to serve the govern-
ment for a specified number of years
after graduation.

Qualified students have the
chance to study abroad. About 100-
200 students are sent yearly by the
Iraq government to different coun-
tries of the world. Lebanon receives
the most because of the popularity
of the American University of Beirut
which has prepared a. large number
of teachers for the Iraqi secondary
schools and has served as a station
for students coming to America to
improve their English. Lebanon,
England, Egypt, the United States,
Switzerland, France, Germany. Swe-
den. Turkey. Italy, and India are
other countries which receive Iraqi
students in that order. The govern-
ment usually pays all the students'
necessary expenses which include
tuition, travel, and a monthly al—
lowance. It the student is a former
government oil'fcinl, he must reini-
burse the government with all ex-
penditincs in his behalf. This sys-
tem allows many a bright but fin-
ancially inadequate student to
achieve a kind of education and
career that otherwise he could never
have had.

Economy-minded individuals skep-
tically point out the cost of equip—
ment. We shrug our shoulders at
this one and stick to the old maxim,
“Where there‘s a will, there's a way."

To the Editor:

Last week‘s Common-Stator ex-
pressed the commendable opliiion,
concerning sorority rushing, that
“It’s too early to start ‘sharpening
your axes'." However, the writers
of the column conveniently ne-
glected to mention the fact that
fraternity rushing seemingly began
in September this year and has con-
tinued unabated. although official
rushing does not begin until the
IFC smoker in November.

We should be aware. however, that
the entire problem goes much fur-
ther than merely ‘dlrty' rushing. It
ultimately comes down to the con-

LET'S GIVE

Today's assembly is the ktck~off for this year‘s
Campus Chest Drive. Some solicitor will contact
every member of Student Association during the next
week asking for a small donation. This is the only
time during the school year that we are asked to
make a financial contribution of any kind. The money
collected for this drive goes for a very worthy cause~
lct’s remember this and give out with the golf while
this drive is on.

BIG TIME

We‘re taking it for granted that everyonc is leaving
Sunday free in order to attend the All-Stale Day
activities. The faculty—student ball game in the after-
noon should prove to be interesting. Slugger Joc and
the Swinging Profs will be out on the diamond bat-
ting thc balls ovcr SayICs Hall.

The square dance and entertainment in the eve-
iiliig will really wind up the day‘s activities in a big
way.

MORE POWER

At Student Council meeting last Wednesday night,
heated discussion followed the proposal that Mys-
kania had suggested to Campus CommiSSion that its
power be increased. 0.0. has adopted a penalty sys-
tem for violators of major and minor offenses. Does
0.0. have the power to enforce these penalties? eg.
take away an activity that a student has rightfully
paid for with his Student Tax, and recommend to
the Administration that a violator be expelled from
school for one week. 8.0. was in favor of increasing
C.C.'s power, now it is up to Student Association to
approve S.C.‘s action. Perhaps this is the only way
that these violators can be reprimanded. Let's hope
this new system works.

CONGRATS IN ORDER

Our second annual Homecoming has come and
gone and from the people milling around last week-
end, it appears to have been quite a success. The
soccer game was well attended, Herbert's was jammed
from 7 to 9 pm, and Bru's dining room was mobbed
for the dance. It‘s too bad that more. Seniors and
Alums didn‘t take advantage of the buffet dinner
Saturday noon. All in all, we had a wonderful time
and want to thank those who worked on the weekend.

FOOD FOR TI-IOUGIIT

It seems that the Boul and Ockie's are more crowded
these days than ever before. Personally, we can't
blame the students for eating out. The food in the
school cafeteria is getting worse day by day. How
about a. change? Let's leave the mayonnaise off the
sandwiches. If people prefer to have some, there
isn‘t any reason why a bowl of it couldn‘t be left on
a table somewhere in the cafeteria.

Football Loops;
KB Wins Two

The Intramural Football League
ran into an unfortunate combina-
tion of bad weather and forfeits
this week. In the two games played,
KB ground out two hard fought vic—
torics.

Last Thursday KB downed SLS
in a bitterly contested struggle by
a score of (5-0. The only score of
the lame came on a bullet pass
from Blatttinni to Sturm, after a
long pass from Blattman to Rcuss
had gotten the ball deep into SLS
territory. The KB defense then held
the SLS offense during the entire
second half, stopping some speedy
running by Neville and accurate
long passes by Geslak. Cassevoy and
Toni Shumanski led the hard charg-
ing SLS line, while KB‘s line was
bulwarked by Cari-era and Goriup.
KB Tops College Heights

The one game played Monday re-
sulted in another victory for KB.
again by a 6-0 score. over College
Heights. The game was a tight de-
fensive battle until twelve seconds
remained in the fourth quarter.
With a scoreless tic imminent Blatt-
mun uncorked a desperation 40 yard
pass which Sturin plucked from the
grasp of three College Heights de—
fenders iii the end zone. Bednarik
and Dcmpstcr generated most of
the College Heights offense, while
Bostick and Zaccaro led the dc-
l'cnsc for the barracks men. The KB
defense was sparked by Milnarik
and Reuss.

The game between the 69ers and
Saiylcs was a double forfeit, result-
ing in Sayles being dropped from
the league.

Talented Freshmen, SOphomores
Spank Unbeaten Soccer Squad

Here are a few shots of some of
the men, both new and old, who are
sparking State's soccer team to an
unbeaten record.

One of the booters who should
receive lots of credit for Albany‘s
fine showing this year is freshman
Paul Dammer. Paul is 23 years old,
5 feet 10 inches tall, and weighs 145
pounds. He hails from Berlin. Ger-
many. where he got lots of experi—
ence in soccer as well as track,
playing both sports for four years
in high school. Paul has been in
the starting line-up since the be-
ginning of the season, and has
shown great skill at the game. His
outstanding play is expected to help
keep the team on top.

Licrmoc (‘licks on Squad

Anotlicr frosli who has proven
himself one of the top bootcrs
around State's campus is Bob Lier-
moe, a l7 year old. 5 foot 11 inch,
145 pouiider who comes from Bay-
shore where he represented his
school on the soccer, track, and

football teams. Bob has played a
good share of all the games this
year and looks as if he will do the
same the rest of the season if he
keeps up this fine aggressive play
against his opponents.

Gilbert Recovers From Injury

Jim Gilbert is also strengthening
Coach Joe Garcia's forces this year
as well as last. Jim is an 18 year
old, 170 pound, 6 footer who at-
tended McGrnw High School be-
fore. coming to State. While there.
he played four varsity sports, soccer
being one of his best. Jim showed up
well last. week when he started
against Plattsburg. Jim wasn't able
to play too much, however, because
he was sidelined with a leg injury
during the earlier minutes of play.
He‘s in line shape now, however.
and we will be seeing lots of boot.-
ing from him in future games.

(‘liamplain Transfer Aids Team

Bill Mason has also looked like
a top rank soccer player over the
past few weeks. Bill is a 23 year
old. 6 foot 1 inch tall 185 pound
commuter from Watervlict. where
he played soccer, football, and bus-
kctball during his high school c11-
reer. Bill attended Champlain Col—
lege for three years before coming
to State. He was a member of the
Champlain football squad. Bill has
switched over to soccer easily, how-
ever, and is getting right into the
swing of the game. Because of this.
Bill should show us lots of good
soccer during the remainder of the
season.

PA‘OI I

Boaters Detect

Two Opponents
To Extend Skein

Coach Joe Garcia and his State
booters engage Middlebury College
tomorrow in a soccer game sched-
uled to get underway at 2 o’clock.
The Vermont team is highly rated,
but the local Peds are confident
their “position playing" strategy
will add another victory to their
fine record.

Booters Win Twice

In last. Saturday’s game State
came up with a 3-0 victory over
Oswego. Offensively Bill Lindberg
and Al "Rocky" Roecklein proved
to be outstanding.

Bill came up with State’s first
score early in the second period on
a penalty kick.

The other two scores of the game
came in the third quarter with
Roecklein accounting for both.

The defensive stars of the game
were a couple of highly underrated
Peds. Ralph Adams has come up
with fine defensive maneuvers game
after game. Another defensive back
whose work goes unnoticed is Phil
Billings. Phil has come up with
remarkable plays that have kept
opposition scoring down to a mini-
mum.

State won its fourth game of the
season against Union last Wednes-
day 3-2 in double overtime. Al
Roecklein scored State's first two
goals in regulation time, while it
was John Lindberg, unable to get
to the game until the fourth quar-
ter. who scored the tie breaker with
a minute to go in the second over-
time period. Bill Lindberg played
his usual fine all around game,
while goalie Tito Guglielmonc play-
ed his heart out, making several
sensational saves.

State Bowling Team
Absorbs First Defeat

State lost its first place standing
in the Albany District Intercollegi-
ate Bowling Lcuguc inst Tuesday
night as Sicnu took the State keg-
lcrs by a score of 4-0. State had
game scoi'cs of 742, 774. and 801,
while Sicna split ilic maples for
scores oi' 807, 843, and 888. State’s
total score for the evening was
3317. while Slcnu had a grand total
of 2538.

State was at it big disadvantage
during the first game us they rolled
with only four men. Another thing
that kept the State bowlers on the
bottom was the absence of high
man Joe "Swizz" Swicrzowski. How-
cvcr, Joe Duran rcprcscnted State
well as he hit for a 548 triple with
a high 214 single. Fred Willie also
had a fine evening as he rolled a
446 triple. Big Tom Shumunski hit
for 451 while Ralph Adams had a
score of 437. John Zidik rolled 288
in two games.
