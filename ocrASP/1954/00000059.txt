troversial issue of whether fraterni-
ties and sororities are really bene-
ficial to the student body as a
whole.

It seems to me that there are al-
together too many college men of
all fraternities placing prestige of
their organization above everything
else. Our student government is
racked frcm top to bottom by the
practice of placing fraternity or
sorority first, the betterment of the
student body second. In too many
quarters the qualifications of can-
didates and thorough analysis of
issues are by-passed in preference
to determining which fraternity the
candidate is a member of; to voting
on an issue on the basis of who
brought up the motion.

As far as the immediate problem
is concerned, there are two ways to
observe the IFC regulations: either
everyone should abide by them, or
else we can make believe the rules
of the game don‘t exist and further
misuse the privilege of belonging to
a fraternity.
