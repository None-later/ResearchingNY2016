Gubernatorial Election:

Thruway Head":
Republican Gains!

By MALCOLM A. ROGERS. .lll.
‘Although it is doubtful as to

whether Senator Ives’ opponent ful,-,.

fills the Constitutional requirements

for the governorship of this state.-

itisnot necessary that We consider
our most humble millionaire op-
ponent at all. We have in the past
and will continue to be interested
in clean, forward, efficient govern-
ment. Throughout the years of the
public service and leadership of
Tom Dewey, New York has grown
to be truly the Empire State. The
election of Senator Ives to the gov-
ernorship will pave the road for
four more years of prosperous ad-
vance through government.

In order to aid both the farmer

and the housewife, Governor Dewey
suggested the “milk moment” in
place ,_of the “coffee break.” Brazil
protested, but the price of coffee
came down, milk consumption rose,
and you pay less in subsidies.
_ After 20 years of blockage by the
Democrats, we have finally sues-.ed-
ed in obtaining permission to de-
velop the hydroelectric potentialities
of the St. Lawrence. Now with Re-
publican action instead of our op-
ponent’s lip service. we can proceed
to increase our standard of living
and attract more industry to ease
unemployment.

The Erwin Road Program has al-
ready improved 2,891 miles of town
roads and before 1963 will improve
9,000 miles more. We're proud they
call the Thruway, “Dewey's Upstate
Boulevard”—free publicity. At a to-
tal cost of one billion, it cost less per
mile than the pikes of Democratic
Ohio, Massachusetts, or Indiana.

Clean government is necessary for
advancement. Governor Dewey will
reside at Pawling but the last two
Democratic mayors of New York
City decided Europe and Mexico
were better. Vote for the Eagle and
Senator Ives to defeat the star per-
former of Tammany.

'Averell Harriman represents a dy-

served in the administration of

as a defender of the laboring classes

segment of the population which
has recently been relegated to canine
status by (the Republican Secretary
of Defense.

Harriman differs from his oppon-
ent and from Republicans in gen-

are other people in this world besides
upstate New Dealers. He is a man of
world-Wide reknown. and has inan-
aged to build that reknown without
the aid of mustachioed baritones.
He has proven himself the sort of
forward-looking man that the great-

than a mere shadow of a me-too
Republican governor.

Because he is an able man, and
an honest man, and because he is
a fitting next act to the opera com:
ique of the last twelve years, I am
voting for Averell Harriman.

We read with great interest last
week the letter to the editor writ-
ten by tw0 members of the "fair
sex” regarding the absence of var-
sity football here at State.

We'd like to start off by saying
we go along with Jane and Sue in
that we favor any plans that would
increase the sports program here on
campus.

Facing the facts though we see
very little chance that our hopes
of a gridiron team will come true.

First of all we sight fallacy in
stating that football would not put
our winning soccer team on the
rocks, It definitely would not only
in respect to player participants,
but also in school support. First of
all there is much football talent
among those men donning a purple
and gold booter uniform. Granted
that 683 men are left, but there is al-
ready one strike against the team
in that outstanding talent is lost
to one or the other of the fall sports.

Strike two comes about when We
consider support—both student and
financial. When we notice the pro-
portion of students at the three
varsity sport games to the total
number in school, we begin to won-
der if the students would even at-
tempt to support anew and perhaps
more crowd-appealing game. If soc-
cer games were scheduled in con—
flict (as they inevitably would be)
with football games, the attendance

5,104! 371011137111

(Ed. Note: Beginning with this
issue the Intramural athlete who,
in the opinion of this staff, turns
in the week’s outstanding perform-
ance, will be given special recog-
nition. Because of the Wednesday
night NEWS deadline the “Sport
Spotlight‘s" week will run from
Wednesday night of the preceding
week to 6 o'clok of the Wednesday
evening preceding the day of pub-
lication.)

The Sport Spotlight for our ini-
tial Column shines on Sam Krchniak
Potter Club‘s l'lcct-footcd left end.
Sam, a Junior from Little Falls, is
well known in IM circles, partici—
pating in football, softball, and bus-
ketball.

In a hard fought nattlc last week
against the 69ers Sam came up with
the deciding touchdown as he snag-
ged a pass from John Morrissey.
Sam‘s TD. along with his fine play,
resulted in a win for Potter which
assured them of a playoff spot in
the gridiron loop. To Sum, its .‘Hats
Off" for the week's outstanding
performance.

Honorable mention this week goes
to Bob Sturm of Kappa Bclu. Boos
outstanding offensch play led the

frat team to a win over Thurlow
and a berth in thc plziyoils. _Bob
caught the pigskin on u llip from

Abe Blattman to put KB over the
top 13-6.

at games would be "halved".

Financial support. The cost of
converting the fields adjacent to the
barracks in itself would be tremen-
dous. What about the cost of foot-
ball uniforms, balls. and other
equipment? One cannot purchase
a uniform for less than $160.00
Thirty times 160 yields quite a big
number. as Math mayors may tes-
tify.

Talent is another blow to State.
Behind all the “rah-rah" of school
spirit we honestly don’t feel we
could field even a mediocre team as
of now. True, ability comes with ex-
perience but having even mediocre
teams would not be a drawing card
for any college applicant consider-
ing the possibilities of playing ball.
Colleges such as N.Y.U. and CCNY
have dropped football for these rea-
sons. How would State fare?

With this it looks like strike three
has crossed our plate—and for our-
selves we say we're sorry—but it
looks like football is out on three
straight pitches.

We‘d like to call to the atten-
tion of IM followers our new Weekly
column “Sports Spotlight." Gripes
may immediately rise as to partl-
ality or why not student poll. Our
defense is twofold: First of all our
combined staff takes in more IM
coverage than any individual. We're
also afraid of having the ballot
box “stuffed.”

All Fraternities Gain Playoll Berths

By ARNIE

The Intramural Football League
neared the end of its season this

week. The four fraternity teams all
managed to secure playoff berths,
while SLS won the championship of
the B League.

Last Thursday College Heights
won its second game of the season,
pinning the first defeat on Thurlow
by a score of 6-0. The only score of
the game came when Mike Hum-
phrey intercepted a wayward Thur-
low pass and ran it back for a
louchdown. The solid line play of
font. Zaccaro, and Bostick kept
Thurlow scoreless, while Bednarik
generated much of the barracks
men‘s attack. Thurlow was sparked
by Blesi and Melamed. In one of
the most important games of the
week Potter squeezed by the 69ers
7-0. The winning score, which clin—
ched a playoff spot for Potter, came
on a fourth down pass in the first
quarter from Morrissey to Krch-
iii-.111. This defeat mathematically
eliminated the 69ers from any
chance of getting into the playoffs.

Monday's games resulted in vic-
torics for KB and Potter over Thur-
low and VanDcrzr-c,respectively. hB

SLS Clinches League

In the one game played Tuesday
SLS pinned the third loss of the
week on Thurlow 14-0, eliminating
Thurlow from playoff competition
and clinching the championship of
the B league for SLS. With three
seconds left in the first half, Bob
Smith ran for a TD from four yards
out. Neville scored the second touch-
down late in the fourth quarter on
a long, twisting run behind good
downfield blocking. The extra points
were scored on a run by Geslak. and
a pass from Geslak to Estramonte.
Dyckman, Denio, and Kalen led a
bustling, never—say-die Thurlow
squad. The 69ers forfeited to Van-
Derzee in the other scheduled game,
resulting in their being dropped
from the league. APA took a for-
feit win from VanDerzee in a game
scheduled for Wednesday.

The top two teams in each league
will now vie for the Intramural
Championship of the school. The B
league has completed its schedule
with SLS taking first place and KB
finishing second. Both APA and
Potter have secured playoff berths,
and are in a tie for first place in
the A league. The deciding game be-
tween APA and Potter is scheduled
too late to make this week’s issue.
