JACK WEBB AND BEN

You know them best as Sgt. Joe Friday and Officer Frank
Smith— stars of Chesterfield’s award-winning “Dragnet”
on TV and Radio. They’re now starred in the movies,
too, in Warner Bros.’ great new picture, “Dragnet.”

WHAT A BUY! Chesterfield regular and king-
size. (Both of the same price in most places).

Jack Webb and Ben Alexander want what you want
from a cigarette. Relaxation, comfort, satisfaction. They
know where to find it—bccausc in the whole wide world,
no cigarette satisfies like a Chesterfield.

Chesterfields are best to smoke because they alone
have the right combination of the world’s best tobaccos.
Chesterficlds are best for you because they're highest

in quality, low in nicotine.

   

Try a carton of Chesterfields today.

LARGEST SELLING CIGARETTE
IN AMERICA’S COLLEGES

years ago, Albert Nathaniel Husted
was graduated from the then State
Normal School and fifty years ago
the fund bearing his name was
started.

When this fund was nearing the
goal of ten thousand dollars set at
the beginning, the presiding presi-
dent of the Alumni Association,
Mrs. Carleton A. Moose (Marie
Townsend '27) appointed a Husted
Fellowship Fund Committee.

Dr. Husted served on the faculty
for fifty-seven years. Because of
Dr. Husted’s half-century on the
teaching staff of the State Normal
School the Executive Committee of
the Alumni Association voted to es-
tablish a fund to be called the
Albert N. Husted Fellowship Fund.

The qualifications established by
the committee are: “A candidate
shall have earned a bachelor's de-
gree from New York State College
for Teachers at Albany. shall have
been in residence for at least tw0
years at this college, and shall have
shown evidence of superior Schol-
arship, character, personality and
interest in teaching.”

First Formal Dances Of Season

 

D & A Council
Offers Award

Documentary

Dramatic and Arts Council will
present The Titan next Tuesday and
Wednesday evenings at 7:30 pm.
in Rm. 349 Draper, announces Fran
Verven '55, President of D. & A.
Council. The Titan. produced by
Robert Flaherty and narrated by
Frederic March. depicts the life and
times of Michelangelo and received
the Academy Award “Oscar” as the
best feature documentary of the
year.

The movie accomplishes an extra-
ordinary job of recreating Michel-
angelo's work and world without.
benefit of the services of :1 single
human actor. The Titan is a pic-
neering combination of an exciting
tribute to the Florentine master and
an impressive tour de force in the
art of the cinema, according to
Miss Verven. All students inter-
ested in art and Michelangelo's
work or in advances in the moving
picture field are invited to attcnd
this movie.

'Primer' Desires

Literary Works
For 1955 Edition

Primer, the literary magazine of
State College is now accepting ma-
terial, both art and literary, for
possible use in next spring's publi-
cation. A definte deadline has not
yet been set.

Bertram Sackman ’55, Editor-in-
Chicf. has released the following
qualifications for literary works.
Technical stories. essays and poetry
should be either neatly handwritten
on one side of a page only, but
prcferably, typed double-spaced on
white paper. Students submitting
material should not place their
name on the actual copy. The name,
address and class numeral of the
student should be put on a separate
page and affixed to the copy.

The number of submissions by one
author is unlimited. The length of
one article, however, is limited to
a maximum of eight typewritten
pages. In regard to the quality and
kind of material there are no re-
strictions, other than those dictated
by good taste. Any subject may be
treated in any manner so long as it
is well written and interesting.

Besides publishing student crea-
tive ability in the field of literature,
the Primer also prints illustrations
drawn by student artists. It is the
goal of the magazine to issue a.
publication that will record the ar-
tistic. as well as the literary
achievement of State College.

Any student who would like to
try out for the art staff of Primer
is requested to contact Harvey
1‘ l'ody ‘56, Art Editor, via Student
Mail.

In the past there has been a no-
ticeable lack of the number of
essays submitted to the magazine.
It is hoped that this deficit will be
filled for this year's publication,
states Sackman. It is the aim of
Primer to encourage the creative
talent of the students and to pub-
lish a magazine which will record
the achievements of the students.
