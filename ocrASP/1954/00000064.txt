Oral Interpretation Class Gives

Second Evening

Of Readings

by JOHN LAING

Tuesday evening the Dramatics
and Art Affiliates and the Class in
Oral Interpretation presented their
second evening of Readings from
Literature, under the direction of
Miss Futterer. The presentation of
seven varying selections was briefly
introduced by Barbara Maaloe, this
week's chairman, after which the
appreciative audience settled in the
seats of Draper 349, ready to enjoy
themselves.

Ada Elian gave the opening in~
hilarious prose work, “Husbands
Grow on Trees.” The story of two
“unobtrusive old maids” delightful-
ly combined, in Miss Elian’s version,
a reading with dramatic interpre-
tation. Her expressive face and voice
gave brightness to her well-develop-
ed characterizations. Her timing was
effectively used, especially the use
of the pause. Miss Elian gave an
intimate, friendly quality to her
reading which helped to maintain
interest.

Two children's poems were next
offered by Maxine Adner. The first
Little Jesus, by Francis Thompson,
was presented with a wide-eyed,
child-like innocence and a high
pitched voice which gave way to a
warm, velvety quality for the touch-
ing close of the poem. The second,
The Ballad of the Harp Weaver,
by E. St. Vincent Mlllay, was also
a touching selection in which the
expressions of the child were well-
handled, both vocally and visually,
by Miss Adner.

The third reader of the evening,
J. Ruben Garcia, gave his version
of Percy B. Shelley's Ode to the
West Wind. His reading was defl-
nitely poetic in that he captured
all the sounds of the poetry-the rich
assonance and flowing consonan—
voice. However, it seemed that the
intrepretation suffered from a tech-
nique so strong that it overwhelmed
the meaning of the poem. The sin-

 

cere lyri-c quality sometimes be-
came a blustering, over-dramatic
‘performance.’

Helene Golda's delightful selec-
tion, The Night the Bed Fell, by
James Thurber, was the evening’s
last prose work. Her mischievious
facial expressions provoked interest
as did her straight--forward deliv-
ery. Miss Golda masterfully built
by progression to the climax of the
typically Thurber story. At times,
she failed to give the proper empha-
sis to key words causing sections of
the reading to be weakened.

Eleanor Goldman chose two
poems, In Atalier by Thomas B. A1-
drich and The Laboratory by Rob-
ert Browning. She created a genu-
ine reflective mood heightened by
perfected minute gestures of the
head and face.

 

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. NOVEMBER 5. 1954

'Ped' Requires
Prools Today

The photographer for the Peda-
gogue will be in Bi‘ubacher Hall
next Wednesday and Thursday for
the last times, announces Ronald
Koster ‘55, Editor of the Pedagogue.

Today will be absolutely the
last chance to turn in proofs
of pictures for the yearbook.
Pictures will not appear in the Ped-
agogue this year for this people who
do not turn in their proofs by that
time.

Anyone who has not yet received
his proofs should contact Kos-
ter as soon as possible through
the mailbox near the 00-01). It
cannot be emphasized too strongly
by Koster that next week is the
last opportunity to have pictures
taken, or to receive proofs, and
today is the last day to turn in
proofs.

Above are Park Houses, North and South, the new dormitories pur-

chased by the State this year.

 

To The Editor:

I just want to say that it has
been a pleasure writing for the
News in the Common-Staten I
want you to know that I consider
it an honor to have been given the
oportunity to write in this column
of personal opinion of State College
activity.

Because of personal reasons that
are not at all connected with the
functions of the State College NeWS
Board or any other Student Asso-
ciation activity, I find it necessary
to submit my resignation as co-
columnist of the Cormnon-Stater.
I am sure that Marilyn and Frank
will write an interesting column.
Thank you for the opportunity;
congratulations on your venture in-
to an experimental stage; and con—
tinued success for the remainder of
the year.

Very sincerely yours.
“Gadd”
iMarilyn Gadd)
To the Editor:

This is the first of what might
be a series of letter commenting
on various phases of student activity
and personalities within these act-
ivities.

My first comment is on the con-
duct of the State College News re-
garding the “breaking of tradition".
Congratulations! The change in
format is a most interesting change
—a symbol of progress. If one week-
end of conferences can add as much
life to a State College activity
as the press conferences did for
the News, I think, perhaps all stud-
ent Associatlon organizations should
have budgetary allotments to give
them the opportunity to see what
civilization is producing on other
campuses of the largest colleges
and universities in the nation. The
apathetic response to these oppor—
tunities is certainly not indicative
of the nature of students selected
to pursue the purpose of State
College and its traditions.

My second activity and personali-
ty comment will deal with Student
Board commission of Student As-
sociation, specifically provided for
in the Student Association Consti—

tution, Article VIII (page 133, 1958
Handbook). The office is a respon-
sible office. The Board supervises
all the expenditures of all Student
Association money, including all the
monies in the facilities fund.

The board consists of Miss Me-
Evoy. Miss Spegele, Miss Battisti,
and Mr. Lo'I‘rugiio, '55; Miss DeCic-
co, Miss Barnhart, and Mr. Casse-
voy, ’56; and Miss Knight ’57. Mr.
Betscha, vice-president of S. A. is
a representative from Student
Council—to the Board, a non-voting
member. Dr. Phinney is the faculty
advisor to the Board.

This Board meets regularly—~ev-
ery Tuesday morning at 10 am.
There are no classes scheduled that
period, stop in some time. The meet-
ings are held on third floor Draper,
right next to Dr. Phinney's office.
It's there every week, there’s no
doubt about that.

The November 2 meeting had a
representative from Campus Com-
mission with a business—like request,
to be carried on in a routine, busi-
ness-like manner. At 10 am., the
meeting was composed of Battisti,
DeCicco, Betscha, and Dr. Phinney.
At 10:10 Lo’I‘ruglio was present.
Shortly after that, Miss Knight was
present. The Campus Commission
representative made her request
known. Mr. Betscha left to seek an-
other member to make a quorum.
Betscha and Mr. C returned from
the cafeteria.

Miss McEvoy is off campus teach-
ing. Miss Barnhart was confined
to her dormitory because of illness.

These officers were elected by
Student Association. This exhibition
is an insult to Student Association
and to State College itself.

STATE PLAYS GENESEO IN HOME FINALE

 

 

We’d like to call to the attention
of everyone in State College that to—
morrow is the final home game for
State's Soccer Team. Word has it
that Geneseo is bringing down a Pep
band to give the much heard of
“spirit” to their team. To counter-
act this we'd like to urge each and
every Stateinan to make it his busi-
ness to be on Beverwyck tomorrow
at 2 o‘clock to cheer the team on to
victory. For many seniors it may be
the last State soccer game they will
see. For those that haven't seen any
yet, we’d like to recommend that
this be their first. The hooters have
worked hard all year, and under the
tutelage of Coach Garcia have come
up with another winning season.
Tomorrow let’s show them We ap-
preciate their efforts by turning out
full force. Come—and bring a friend
with you.

[M Football—as long as we're in
the mood for urging, we'd like to
urge all IM followers to tukc in the
championship football game be-
twecn Potter and APA Sunday.
It promises to be the bcsl gmnc of
the season. At this time also we'd
like to praise the work of thc offi-
cials in last Sunday's gumcs. ’l‘hcy
did a marvelous job. At ii time
when everyone was especially tcnsc.
they saw to it that the giiiiics wci'c
played as they should bc. and no
fights bi'okc out. Aftcr seeing some
of thc officiating in thc i'cgulur

SWSaqd...'

season where as many as three
fights in one game broke out, we
began to wonder where the officials
sense of decency and fairness was.
At times it looked like intramurder
and not intramural football! 80 to
those men it's congratulations for
a job well done.

Bowling: As long as Intramural
Bowling is starting Lip next week.
we‘d like to put in our predictions.
We‘re just wondering who will come
in second in the “faster” league
when the kegling starts? As it is
now, SLS claims five of the six in—
tcrcollcgiute bowlers, all of whom
have over 160 average. The only
thing that will hinder the frat team
is the big "sixth" man they'll face
each weeker. Handicap himself.
Thc handicap system is a wonder-
ful one in that it will place all
teams, rcgarlCSs of score, on a some-
what level plane.

Sports Shorts: We'd also like to
remind all IM athletes that signup
sliccts are still up for fcncing. bus-
kctbull. and rifle clubs. . . . Coli-
gi'zitulnfions to Bob Back or who
wns clccicd frosh reprcscntntivc to
M..\.A.-~also to Pottcr for winning
thc volleyball tournament. . . . We'd
like to cull attention to our “Sport
Mailbox." We welcome all sugges—
tions mid criticisms. Letters for
thc Mailbox how to be in by Wed-
ncsdiiy noon.

New Haven Transfer Thinks State
Able To Support Football Program

In last week's edition of the State
College News, we noted with in-
terest the new column "Swizz Says."
The column concerned itself with
intercollegiate football at State.

We'd like to say Swizz is unduly
pessimistic in regard to starting an
intercollegiate football team at
State.

Bcfoi'c I transferred to State, I
attended New Haven State Teach-
ers College in New Haven, Conn.
I entered New Haven in the fall of
1950. Two years prior to that date,

intercollegiate football was started
at New Haven with a squad of 14
men and a total school enrollment
of 900 persons of which only 300
were men. By the time I entered
New Haven, we had a squad of 30
men and were beating teams such
as Brockport, Champlain, and Bran-
deis. From 1950 to 1952, New Haven
was small college defensive champ-
ion with an average of 81.3 yards
per game gained against them. In
addition, we had a wide area fol-
lowing iii spite of the fact we had
to compete with a team like Yale.
This, mind you, with only an en-
rollment of 300 men.

We think. "Swizz," three strikes
are three fat balls: 1. At the present
time. there are only three ex—foot-
ball players on the Soccer Squad;
Don Canonica, Wendell Fowler, and
Bill Mason. We don't think the
Soccer Squad would lose any talent.
2. We think the school would show
as much, if not more, support to a
football team. We can't see why
the football and soccer schedules
couldn't be staggered so as to allow
each team to play at home on al-
ternate Saturdays. 3. Except for an
initial grant of $18,000, the entire
sports program at New Haven was
supported by a $25 per person stu-
dent tax. I’m sure we could get an
$18.00 initial grant to give our pro-
gram 0 push.

Likewise, we don't think talent
is a problem. It is a well known
fact among members of the Physi-
cal Education department that
football was started at State, we
could very easily draw 30 good play-
ers from the Albany area who go
to other colleges because they offer
football.

It is also a well-known fact that
schools the size of Albany State usu-
ally huve a ten sport intercollegiate
athletic program. That's right, we
said ten.

We don‘t like to sound optimistic.
but we feel that footbau, given a
hance, can succeed at State. All
it needs is that initial push.

Peds Seek Sixth
Win Oi Year,-

Down islanders

By JOE PURCELL

Five State Seniors will play their
last home soccer game tomorrow
as the Peds meet Geneseo State
Teacher's College in the last home
encounter of the season.

The men who will see home ac-
tion for the last time are Ralph
Adams, Bill Lindberg, Don Canon-
ica, Phil Billings and Joe Mc-
Dowell.

.i

Ralph Adams has starred as left
fullback on the State College eleven
for four years, gaining All-State
honors during his Sophomore year.
Bill Lindberg is another booter who
will be missed in years to come.
Bill played his first soccer at State
last year and was given honorable
mention on the All-American squad
at the end of the season. Bill has
played heads-up ball all this season
and is expected to put up a fine
last showing.

Don Canonica and Phil Billings,
two more backfield men will also
play on Beverwyck for their last
time tomorrow. Don has played
good ball in the right fullback
slot over the past years and Phil
has covered a lot of territory as
right halfback on the State eleven;
both of them played on the cham-
pionship team last year.

Joe McDowell closes out his career
on the home field tomorrow as one
of Coach Garcia's top subs. Joe
should see lots of action in the
game against Geneseo.

B. Lindberg Leads State’s Win

The booters go into the game
with a record of five wins, one loss
and two ties, having downed Long
Island University last Saturday by
a score of five to one. Bill Lind-
berg lived up to the reputation of
toughest opponent given him by
the Long Islanders as he booted
three goals in the last period of
play. Al “Rock” Rocklein and Ed
Jones also collected a goal each to
lead the State attack.

3M spam-w

Our selection for the IM athlete
of the week goes to John Morrisey
for his splendid work in quarter-
biicking Potter Club to its 13-0
win over SLS.

John, a Senior from Saratoga
Springs, had the SLS men baffled
in the first half on his quick halid-
offs to Jack Klein. In the second
half he found the target as he
hit Sam Krchniak for a TD pass.
Late in the fourth quarter, he again
flipped to Nels LaRoe, who went all
the way for the score. To finish all
his brilliance, he again hit Nels for
the extra point.

Honorable mention goes to Bob
Strauber who scored three TD's
for APA in their 27-0 win over KB.
