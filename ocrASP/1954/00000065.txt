Debate Council
Requests Views
On Controversy

A special assembly of the Student
Association will be held next Mon-
day evening at 7 pm. resulting from
the Wednesday evening Student
Council meeting, reports Phyllis Bi-
alow '56. President of Debate Coun-
cil. The purpose of the meeting will
be to give members of the student
body an opportunity to present their
views concerning the Debate Coun-
cil’s acceptance or rejection of the
following debate topic—Resolved:
that the United States should ex-
tend diplomatlc recognition to the
Communist Government of China.

Recently, a large number of col-
leges and universities, of their own
violation, have rejected the topic
for reasons of national policy, states
Miss Bialow. In addition, the mili-
tary schools such as West Point and
Annapolis have been ordered by the
Department of Defense to reject the
controversial topic. Catholic schools
numbering about 165 have also been
told not to debate this topic for
moral reasons.

It is Debate Council’s responsi-
bility to consider possible effects of
pro or con decision on the status
of State in relation to other schools
and to decide whether to accept or
reject the topic for debate. The
council requests members of the
Student Association to attend the
special assembly and to express
their opinions and considerations
concerning this topic, thus aiding
the Council to reach a wise and
representative decision.

The subject in question is a mat-
ter of great national and interna-
tional portent, and Debate Council's
decision should reflect the views of
the entire student body, reports
Miss Bialow.

State Approves

Debate Council
Admits lNews’,

Accepts Topic

At a meeting Tuesday of Debate
Council the Council voted eleven to
one in favor of the motion “I move
that Debate Council continue to
debate the topic. Resolved: That the
United States should extend diplo-
matie recognition to the Communist;
government of China, and debate
the topic as scheduled.”

The meeting was covered by a
special News reporter and the Ed-
itor, after having secured a ruling
from Myskania that the meeting
be open to Student Association, its
representative being the News.

Prior to the vote a discussion en-
sued as to any reflection that might
arise on the character of the stu—
dents, and/or their chances of los-
ing possible jobs or advancements
because they debated the affirma-
tive. It was viewed, however, that
there would be little chalice of this
happening since no record as to
who argued the affirmative or neg-
ative is kept.

The next debate by State College
using this controversial topic will
be at Siena College this evening.
Phyllis Lyeth, Barbara Salvatore
and Linda Niles, Juniors and Emilee
Vavra '57 will debate at this timc.
At the Dartmouth College Tourney,
this Saturday. Linda Niles, Barbara
Salvatore and Phyllis Lycth, Jun-
iors and Rita Cohen ‘57 will repre-
sent the college. Thc tourney will
consist of four rounds of debating
with approximately 1:3 schools at—
tending. State will be the only New
York State school in attendance.

This evening State Debaters and
all interested parties have been in—
vltcd to attend a lecture at Siciia
Collcgc by Donald Dixon, INS re-
porter. \"lio was held a prisoner of
war in Chitin for cigthcccn months.
The lecture will be at 8 pm. in

By RICHARD SAUER

Because of the controversy arising from this

debate topic, Resolved: That

ear’s
the United States shou (1 ex-

tend diplomatic rccognition to the Communist government
of China, Debate Council and Student Council requested
that a special assembly be held Monday night, at which
time the student body’s opinion as a whole could be ex-
pressed. through discussion and voting of a resolution
for or against having our school debate it. After approxi-
mately two hours of discussion it was voted to allow the
council to debate the topic if it is possible for them to

field a team.

Prior to the opening of the meeting, Kappa Phi Kappa,
national education fraternity, distributed copies of a reso-
lution passed by its members and advocating the accept-
ance of the topic. The resolution states: WHEREAS the

WHEREAS debate is one means of
presenting both sides of a contro-
versial issue.

BE IT RESOLVED by the broth-
ers of the Chi chapter of Kappa
Phi Kappa that the topic “Resolved:
that the United States should ex-
tend diplomatic rccognition to the
Communist government of China
should be debated."

Shortly after discussion began, a.
question arose as to what position
the administration held on this is-
sue, if any. Dr. Evan R. Collins,
President of the College. read the
following statement as to the Col-
lege's stand:

The College must stand for full,
frank, free debate on this or any
other matter of basic public policy.
Fundamental to our concept of gov-
ernment is the principle that an
informed. enlightened citizenry is
the source of democraey’s strength.
To remove any matter of public
policy from public discussion by
dropping an intellectual iron cur-
tain. denies the right of citizens to
be informed. Who is then to deter-
mine what matters it is proper for
all men to consider?

With the consultation and advice
of Student Association, Debate
Council should feel perfectly free to
decide this question as the mem-
bers of the Council may determine;
no considerations of College policy
limit their freedom of choice. Each
member takes his own position as
a member of Debate Council, and.
in addition. decides whether he
personally wishes to debate one or
the other side of this question, or
neither side. Just as we abhor any
denial of free. debate and discus-
