TO PASS
To pass, or not to pass: that is the

Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to

Or to take up slide rules against a

And by opposing pass them? To
flunk: to leave Albany;

No more: and by leaving to say we
end

The beer-drinking and the thousand
unnatural shocks

That the fresh is heir to, ’tis a.
consummation

Devoutly to be wished. To flunk, to
leave:

To leave: perchancc not to become
draft bait,
Ay there‘s the rub.

State To Feature
Speedy Attack
In Hoop Battles

After three weeks of practice,
Coach Merlin Hathaway has suc-
ceeded in cutting both the Junior
varsity and varsity basketball squads
to twelve men each. It looks like
the varsity is going to be loaded
with speed and spirit this year. but
there will be big weaknesses in the
rebounding and scoring divisions.

The man who could do a lot to
improve the team’s rebounding def-
icit, however, is big 6’7” Lou Carr.
Lou has all the height he needs but
last year lacked the fight to become
a real good board man.

There is also some hope in 6’3”
frosh. Don Mayer who playes a real
rugged game. What he can do
against other colleges, however, it
vet to be seen. John Rookwood will
be the other "big" man on State's
roster this year. John stands 6’2"
and last year'used this height to
advantage against J.V. competition,
averaging 16 points per game.

Sig Smith is the man to watch
as far as scoring goes this year. He
had some real good nights last year
and should be one of the more con-
sistent point earners this season.

When we look for speed we see
veteran Nels Laroe and Sophomores
Joe Anderson and Denny Dempster,
home as a regular last year was ii
real good playinaker, defensive man
and scorer, hitting mostly from the
outside. Anderson and Dempsler are
both being brought up from the
junior varsity. Spunky Joe Anderson
was the second highest scorer on
the junior team last year. Demp-
ster didn't start playing ball until
mil—season last year but showed the
spunk and scoring eye to soon work
himself up into a regular pOSition.
He is expected to do a lot for the
squad this year.

Laltoe. McDonald Co-Captains

Laroe, along with Jerry McDon-
ald will co-captain the team this
year. McDonald was also a regular
last year and is another of the lead-
ing men in the speed department.
Jerry is probably the flashiest ball
iandler on the team and should
prove a tough man for his team-
mates to compare with.

l‘eds Lose Five .
Despite all the talent before
Coach Hathaway’s eyes, he notes

the absence of talented hoopsters
John Centra, Bill Walker and John
Allasio who have been lost Via
graduation. the loss of Chris _Bog-
iagcs to the Air Force and of Joe
Donnclly to Utica State, the Feds
opening foe. has also dampened the
hopes of the State squad. With the
spirit the team is showing. however.
anything can happen.
