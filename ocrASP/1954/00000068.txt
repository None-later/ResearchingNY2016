Dr. Collins further states that
“Whatever its decision, Debate

will also of Student Association."

Arguments for the approval of

Comedy Features
Christian, Lion

The State College Production of
George Bernard Shaw‘s comedy.
“Androcics and the Lion." will be
presented on the stage of Page Hall
December 3, reports Patricia Hall
‘57, Publicity Director. Dr. Paul B.
Pettit, Associate Professor of Eng-
lish, is directing the play.

The play concerns the early days
of Rome when Christians were be-
ing thrown to the lions. A poor
Christian tuilor finds himself in the
arena with a unique lion in a uni-
que situation. Androclcs, the Chris-
tian, is played by Robert Woyton
'58. who has played Shakespearean
roles here and has had previous
professional experience in summer
stock. Barbara Hungcr'ford '57 takes
the part of Androclcs‘ wife, a spir-
ited. shrewish role. The lion rs port—
rayed by Alriana Boson ‘57.

Publicity for the play includes
radio and television interviews.
Mona Smith will publicize the play
on her program on WOKO, Decom-
her 1. at 1:45 pm, and Forrest
Willis, WTRY. November 23, 11:30.
Dr. Pettit and one or LWO members
of the cast will appear on the Bob
Stone Program on WRGB TV No-
vember 30 at 1 p.m.

thought in my classroom? How can
this sort of thing end? Where are
we going to draw the line?”

Those persons urging the rejec-
tion of the debate topic argued the
points that there was no issue on
infringement of freedom of speech
or academic freedom since there
had been no directives from any
authoritative position asking or or-
dering us not to debate the topic.
Also it was pointed out that since
Communist China has committed
barbarous acts upon this nation and
the free world and because they
were in conflict with us in Korea
the topic should not be considered.
It was also pointed out that many
schools had rejected the topic in
excess of military schools and it
might be more practical to choose
a topic that is acceptable to all
schools. The question also arose as
to whether in the future the debat-
ing of this topic by a student might
hamper his opportunity for ad-
vancement in education.
