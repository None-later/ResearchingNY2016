State's Soccer Squad '
Ends Winning Season

State's soccer team ended their
season last Saturday , absorbing a
loss at the hands of Panzer College
in East Orange, New Jersey. Center
forward Neil O’Donnel paced the
Panzer squad as he scored all three
goals in the 3-0 battle. The only
casualty of the game was when Don
Canonica, one of State’s top full-
backs was rushed to the hospital
durin gthe second half where he was
treated for a bad ankle sprain.
State Wins Five

State wound up with a 5 won, 3
lost, and 2 even record for the sea-
son. having suffered defeats to RPI,
Geneseo, and Panzer. They tied
Plattsburg and Middlebury and were

able to collect wins over strong
teams representing Fordham,

Lindberg Sets Pace

Bill Lindberg set the pace for
scoring as he collected nine of
State’s 24 goals; three of them in
the game against LIU. Al "Rock"
Roecklein was the second. highest
scorer for the squad as he kicked
six goals for the year. State de-
fensive play was outstanding as
they allowed their opposition to
score only seventeen goals during
the season.

Next year’s soccer squad will be
greatly weakened due to the gradu-
ation of fullbacks Don Canonica
and Ralph Adams, and halfbacks
Bill Lindberg and Phil Billings.
These four men have been the
sparkplugs of this year's defense
as well as Lindberg's great offensive
showing. The loss of outside left
Joe McDowell will also weaken next
year’s squad.

APA Keglers
Gain IM Lead

APA took four points from KB to
gain undisputed possession of the
number one slot in the downstairs
division of the Intramural Bowling
League. Strauber was high man for
the APA keglers as he collected a
483 triple. Arnie Newman paced the
KB club with a 408 triple. Potter
Club took over second position in
the league as they took three points
from the SLS bowlers. John Zidik
did his best in a losing cause as he
rolled a high 540 triple for the week.
He also collected a 222 single to set
a high for this year. Dave Borden
split the maples for a 504 triple to
lead the Potter Club attack.

In the other downstairs league
game, the Saylesmen, led by Leo
Legault's 460 triple, took four points
from the APAthetics. Eagan was
number one man for the APAthetics
as he rolled a 421 for the afternoon.

In the upstairs division of the
Bowling League, the APAches split
with the Rousers. Polito collected a
450 triple for the APAches while
Small was high for the Rousers with
436. Summit gained three points

Having suffered a loss to Panzer
College last Saturday, State’s soc-
cer team ended another season. To
some it may seem that their cam-
paign was somewhat unsuccessful.
To us however. we feel that Coach
Garcia and his men came through
better than might be expected. Bad
breaks such as John Pengelly's and
Bill Bonesteel's injuries at the start
of the season didn't help the Coach’s
hopes much. Otherwise inevitable
injuries plus bad playing conditions
such as the high winds at Bridge-
port and rain-soaked Hawkins Sta-
dium gave the booters new obstacles
to overcome. Finally the injuries to
Don Canonica in the ﬁnal two games
didn’t make State fans too opti-
mfstic.

In spite of all this the Feds show-
ed much spirit. won five games and
tied two. Besides this they carried
the State in commendable fashion
to many parts of the New England
area. Throwing in a few prognosti-
eations it will come as no surprise
if Don Canonica and Bill Lindberg
are nominated for All-American. To

 

an error we made in last week’s
issue. We said SLS was the defend-
ing bowling champions. Although
SLS did win the faster league, the-
APAches, winners in the "B" league
were the playoff winners and de-
fending champions. We'd like to
apologize to APA for letting this
slip through. This is not to take
away from the might of last year’s.
SLS keglers. however, since they
did spot the APAches a 500 pin
handicap—more than enough for a.
sixth man.

RIVALRY: We'd like to remind
all the Blue Jays and Red Devils
that tomorrow the athletic program
of Rivalry draws to an end with the
ﬁeld events. We'd like to see all of"
you out there giving your class
moral support. To you athletes—
there's still room for you on the
signup sheets—so put your “John
Hancock” on today.

ing to hear that AA ofﬁcials have
