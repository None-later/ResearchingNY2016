' “I’ve wanted to be an editor ever since I worked on a boy’s magazine
at age 8. After being an editor of the Dartmouth literary magazine (The Dart),.
I set my sights on Esquire. It took 18 years of hard work to achieve
the editorship — after struggling as a newsmagazine cub, cartoon and
essay writer, advertising copy writer and trade paper editor.”

Tomorrow the curtain goes up on
another of State’s Basketball teams.
From all indications thus far. this

year promises to be quite an inter-
esting one for Coach Hathaway and
his men. After several weeks of
hard practice the hoopsters will take
the hardwood against the Engineers
of RPI tomorrow night. As usual
we’d like to urge all of you to come
out and cheer for the team. Page

admit. but. nevertheless. let’s swell
the rafters and show our hard work-
ing athletes we're behind them all
the way.

Rivalry:

Now that Rivalry is over we'd like
to go over the athletic events and
pick out a few men whom we
thought were outstanding. In the
softball game John Stefano's work
in organizing the team and handling
of Gerry Birr’s and Bob Hacker's
pitching cannot be overlooked. Har-
ry Millet’s grand slam and Sal
Zacraro’s big triple spelled doom
for the Red Devils. In the football
encounter the Soph trio of John
Rockwood, Joe Zizzi, and Joe Ander-
son were the blg guns in the shut—

Potter Club took over first place
in the downstairs division of the
Intramural Bowling League as they
took three points from APA Wed-

the Potter keglers with 159-185-174

505 helped APA cop one point. In
other games played in the down-
stairs division. SLS split with the
