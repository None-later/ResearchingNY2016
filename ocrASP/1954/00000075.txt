Albany Schools
To Hear Scripts

Radio Guild is initiating a pro-
gram of twelve scripts to be pre-
sented in the Albany Public Schools
throughout the year. The ﬁrst script,
directed by Anne Marie Persico '57.
was completed this week, states
Nancy Feder '55, President of Ra-
dio Guild.

Sound effects for Miss Persico's
script were provided by Harold
Schwager ’56. William Floyd, Grad,
did the narration.

Try outs participating were: Jes-
se Vics '57, Leo Lagault, Ralph Cul-
ver, Emmet Ten Broeck, Ronald
Longto, freshmen. Anyone interested
in participating is requested by MiSs
Feder to consult the Radio Guild
bulletin board in Husted.

Schools in the Albany Public
School system will be working with
the Guild in this project. Scripts
are of a nature suitable for pre-
sentation to children of the ele-
mentary and Junior High School
level. They will concern the history
of Albany.

We find two "types" on this
campus wnich at this time of year
are not very unique: The tired stu-
dent . . . and the tired pror. An Old
Calabrian Dirge from the Vassar
Miscellany ..News expresses the
plight of our “dear ole teachers."

When disquisitory duty's to be

done, to be done

A professor’s life is not an 'appy

one, an ’appy one.
C II J!

The Rensselaer Polytechnic re-
echoes the plight of we poor stu-
dents.

My nerves are very close to break-

me,

My spirits are as damp as any

ocean:

For each professor has the notion

That his is the only class I‘m

taking.

To "alleviate" our mind of these
trite complaints we picked up the
University of Buffalo Spectrum and
here is what we found:

Teacher: “Spell straight."

Pupil: “S-T-R-A-I-G-H-T.”

Teacher: “Correct. Now what
does that mean?”

Pupil: “Without ginger-ale."

I I It

Judge: “So they caught you with
this bundle of silverware. Whom
did you plunder?”

Yegg: “Two fraternity houses,
your honor."
Judge: “Call up the downtown

hotels, sergeant, and distribute this
stuff."

Irate Father: “Why were you kiss-
ing my daughter in that dark cor—
ner last night?”

Dubious youth: “Now that I've
seen her in the daylight, I sort of
wonder myself.”

Stetesmen 76-72

team lost its first home game

of the season, 67-59, to the invading engineers of RPI.
As in its previous loss, State lost this game on the foul

line as it failed to sink the

majority of its free throws.

Lew Carr led the State scorers web 24 points in addi-

tion to rebounding superbly

JV Hoop Squad
Bows To HVT

The State College Junior Varsity
quintet lost its game to Hudson Val-
ley Tech 77-73 in a real thriller. The
little Peds led by a substantial mar-
gin throughout the first half, but
failed to come out on top at the end
mainly because they missed 21 of
52 foul shots.

Another big factor in the JV’s
loss was the presence of Hudson
Valley‘s lanky center, Gates. Gates
ended up the game with 38 points
to cop scoring honors. He dropped in
30 of these points during the second
half to whittle down State's early
lead.

The State JV was paced by Millet

At the end of the first half RPI

half RPI started to really assume

the cagers started to drive and cut
the lead down to six points with
about three minutes to go. RPI, tak-
ing full advantage of the three min-
ute rule, managed to stave off any
last minute rally by the State squad.
Staves Off Rally

The last few minutes were “wild
and wooly" ones as three State men
fouled out trying to gain possession
of the ball. Dempster started to go
in for his driving lay-ups success-
fully ln the second half to help con-
siderabyl in State's second half rally.
The squad was hampered rather
seriously during the first half when

This week's spotlight beams on
Carl Mzixson, freshman forward on
the Sayles basketball team. Carl
scored 3] points in lending Sayles
to a surprising one-point overtime
victory over APA in their flrst game
of the season. On the basis of this
perfornmnce Sayles should prove a
strong contender for the league and
the school championship.

This week's runnerup is John Ze-
dik, leading bowler of the faster
IM league. John led his SLS team-
mates to a 3-1 victory over KB by
bowling 186-183-182 for ii 551 triple.
John also increased his average to
the point where his first place posi-
tion is well nigh impregnuble.

 

Although managing to put on an-
other last minute spirited drive the
Feds lost their third straight game
of the year to Oneonta Wednesday
night.

Big Lew Carr again led the local
cagcrs, who came within one point
of Oneonta late in the third quar-
ter, as he looped in 24 points. Lew
had good backing from Sig Smith's
18 and Nels LaRoe's 16 while Denny
Dempsier set up many plays.
