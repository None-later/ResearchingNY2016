RONALD LACKEY
Editor-in-Chief

 

The Advent Oi Editor Number 40

With fourteen issues of our favorite extra-curricular
activity completed, another Editor has joined the ranks in
the bound editions. I can say, however, that I am most
happy to turn the traditional “ruler of authority" over
to you, Editor Number 40, even though you, like many of

your predecessors, are of the “fairer sex."

I have been

Chief for the briefest period in the history of the State

College News.

Despite this, I have been confronted with

many decisions to make, some trivial, others major, and
consequentially realized the full significance of the word

responsibility.

In short, it stems from an obligation due

in the present both to your readers and eo-workers, sup-
plemented by the nearly forty-year old tradition behind

the State College News.

It involves meeting pressures di-

rected at the editorial policy, and withstanding urges, both

of a personal nature and otherwise.

Ultimately it entails

employing the inherited authority to control the News in
the capacity of a link between past and present, in order

to insure a progressive future.

I saw this responsibility

shouldered by others, too, in the strengthening of the
motto: the News always comes out on Friday, tested in

one instance this semester.

For these infinite and irreplaceable experiences my

gratitude is extended on a four-fold basis.

First and fore-

most to my staff, a numbered few rewarded only by the
satisfaction of their work in the Publications Office (PO).
Second to the News Board, which afforded fellowship, and
confidence and advice when needed. Third to our publish-
ers, the Hudson Register-Star, for their reliability, and
their tolerance of a college mind. And finally to the col-
lege administration and faculty, whose commendations
and suggestions I acknowledge appreciatively.

The unforgettable memories retained by an Editor
are both cherished and lasting. I am happy to relinquish

my access to them.

Create Con iu sing Atmosphere

Something different is in the air
these days; that is, besides the dust
and mist from the pile driver and
recently torn-down chimneys. On
the whole, it's rather a feeling of
contagious anticipation that has
welcomed us back to school after
two weeks of blissful leisure.

Visions of I.B.M. machines flash
through our minds as once more
we are asked to decipher the lucid
pre-rcgislration instructions posted
all about. So we take our trusty eat-
iilogues mid meekly assume our
places in line waitingr for a faculty
member to brief us on the latest
requirements and rulings concern—
ing course selections, which would
naturally differ considerably from
those described in the catalogue.
However, after a few hours. We can
look iorwurd to partaking of the
rainbow assortment, marking the
end of our labors. This includes the
pink curd, bluu card. white card,
purple, and green card. all in the
softest pastel shades no doubt to
calm our shaken nerves. Such both-

 

er about the new semester when our
trials for the present. one iire yet to
comet!

Yes, examinations are also in the
air, although the fact is superbly
concealed. Instinct demands they
be held soon. even though no sched-
ule is out to show this. However, not
trusting the unlikely, we reach for
the typewriters, put finishing
touches on term papers. and ultim-
ately delve into the textbooks here-
tofore considered supplements to
the lecture notes in class.

New sounds are around too. We
detect the scurrying and clocking
of heels as ii new group of the
well-dressed "elite" prepare to enter
the halls of Milne or go away from
the sheltered campus iiiio the
world

There's a tense atmosphere around
State these days, but in a way, it
seems it natural accompaniment to
the completion of five month‘s Work
that takes us one nick closer to
graduation.

College Enlarges
Teaching Facilities

Many students will be required

‘ to teach off-campus next semester

Pile Drivers, Bricks, Examinations Philippine Leader

due to an increase in enrollment
and increased use of the Milne
classes for methods and observa—
tions. states Clinton Roberts, Co-
ordinator of Off-Campus Student
Teaching and Laboratory Experi-
ences.

All students who expect to do
their strident teaching next year
should contact Mr. Roberts in

Richardson 1 us soon as possible. A
preliminary survey is being made to
detcmiine the number of students
who will be assigned to Ed. 1148T
off—campus next year.

An attempt is being made to have
oiily one student teacher assigned
to each Milne class next year. This
fact, plus a sharply increased col-
lege enrollment, makes it lll‘Ct.‘;»Hill‘)’
to have more students do their stit-
deiit teaching off—campus.

Mr. Roberts is holding interviews
to determine which students will
find it possible to be assigned to
off-ciunpus teaching. Unless a stu—
dent has urgent personal reasons or
course icquii'einents which would
make it necessary for him to do his
student teaciiiiig in Milne, it may be
necessary for him to accept an off-
ciimpus assignment. Interviews for
these students will be held in Rich-
ardson 1.
