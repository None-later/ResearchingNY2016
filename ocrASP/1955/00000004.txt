Potter Maintains Winning Skein

By ARNIE NEWMAN

The Intramural Basketball League
resumed action after the long
Christmas vacation on the hard-
woods of Page Gym. A full slate of
games was played on both Monday
and Wednesday evenings.
Saylesmen Win by 8

In the opening tilt last Monday,
the Saylesmen defeated Hilltop by
eight points, 62-54. High scoring
Carl Maxson led the Saylesmen with
28 points, most of them scored in
the second half. Schrader scored 1'7
to pace the Hilltop quintet. This
game was much closer than the
final score indicates. Hilltop led by
10 points at the half and by as
many as 13 points at one point in
the game. However, the Saylesmen,
with Maxson and Denio ﬂipping in
baskets, came back with a rush dur-
ing the second half.

Flyers Eke Out Victory

VanDerzee outpolnted the Ridge
Rebels, 47-33, in the second game.
Hard-driving Don Rice hooped 14
points to lead the winners; Young
was high man for Ridge, with 11.
This was a bitterly fought game
with VanDerzee showing deﬁnite
superiority in the second half.

The ﬁnal game of the evening
was a close one in which the Flyers
outscored KB, 54-51. Bar-bagallato
was the highest scoring Flyer with
30 'points. Goldstein and Milnarik
shared scoring honors for the los-
erswith 14 points apiece. The Flyers
led by 10 points at halftime; how-
ever, KB came roaring back and led
by six with about four minutes left
to play. Elkin played a key role in
the ﬁnal surge which brought vic-
tory to the Flyers by scoring all nine
of his points in the waining mo-
ments of the game.

EP handily defeated Hilltop in
the Wednesday night opener, 46-36.
O'Loughlin and Roecklein provided
much of the scoring punch for EEP
with 15 and 14 points, respectively.
Hilltop's entire offense was built
around Demske and Maxian who
each scored 16 points. Hilltop got
off to a slow start in this contest
and was never really able to get
back in the ball game.

Potter Romps, 53-22

The second game. pitted SL8
against Potter. The Club was real-
ly “up” for this game and complete-
ly outplayed SLS to win, 53-22.
Potter’s scoring was well divided
among four players; Stark was the
high scorer with 15, while Wier-
miller chipped in with 10. Estra-
monte and Willi both had eight to
pace the losers.

Crawlers Forfeit

In the ﬁnale, the Pub Crawlers
were unable to make it to Page and
forfeited to Summit House.

With over twenty teams compet-
ing in three leagues and the season
not yet half over, we are probably
going out on a thin limb in trying
to predict the eventual Intramural
Basketball Champions of the school;
nevertheless, it seems to us that
the Potter Club team will be the
one to beat. Their chief competi-
tion may come from a couple of
very strong dormitory teams: Thur-
low and the Salyesmen.

APAchies Increase Bowling Lead,-
SLSmen Gain Ground On APA

The Intramural Bowling League
continued to roll successfully along
as it neared the half-way mark of
its season. The averages continued
to improve as the bowlers started
to hit the “rocket” more consist-
ently.

APA maintained its lead in the
fast Downstairs League this week
despite losing to KB by a. score of
3-1. KB. benefiting from an 82 pin
handicap, still had to bowl well
above its average to defeat a ﬁred
up APA kegling squad whose team
totals topped 800 in two out of the
three contests. Newman led the
winners with a 470 triple. while
Strauber bowled 539, high triple for
the week. to pace the losers. Steph-
enson was right behind him with
a 517 triple including a 203 second
game, high single for the week.
SLS Beats Potter

SLS also won its match from Pot-
ter by a score of 3-1 to climb into

 

5% Saw

With the post-holiday lack of
sports news we thought it might be
interesting to dig into the records
of State‘s basketball teams and
bring out a few records. Admittedly.
however, we didn't have to do any
digging thanks to Bob Ashfielo and
his Athletic Public Relations Board
who are doing an excellent job pub-
licizing State’s sporLs program. The
brochure which the Board sends. out
to States opponents contains many
interesting facts and figures oom-
piled throughout the years.

Ccntra And Walker Set Records

We‘ve picked out a few that we
thought might be of interest. lo lbc
readers oi this page.

A name the present upperclrrss-
men will remember is John Centre,
last year‘s captain, who now hCl'VCn
Uncle Sam in the Coast Guard.
John's 336 points last year illid 552
for two years are tops. Another scr-
viccman and '54 graduate. Bill
“Hiram” Walker, leads in 3 and 4
your total point reduction wuh 726
and 866 points respectively.

The high single game honors for
an individual are held by Sy Feisl
who hooped in 34 during on uWuy
game in the ’48-'40 season. For Four
Hail Walker and Contra share lou—
rcls for the Feds with 30 points
each. The 1111 time record in hold
by Karl "Bud" Lucbbcrt of tin-
Uticri 'i‘ungcrincs who set tbi: fans
buzzing in 1951 with it 41 point ol-
fort.

Walker again coincs into Lhc pic-
ture for both most foul shots rcul'cd
(Total 230') and most iicld honls
scored 1310), Top honors for sin-
glc season’s play goes to John (.‘cii-
ti'u (I32) and Sig Smith (04),

In team records thc longest wni
strciik was seen by the ‘53-'54 hoop
fans «8 games), while the '46-’47
fans had the disappointment of

seeing their athletes drop 12
straight.

State Scores 108 Last Year

No doubt everyone will remember
the hectic game Coach Hathaway's
men turned in last year when they
played Utica. The game ended up
with Stan: on the brighter Side of
a 108-94 tally. Three records were
broken as four ovoriimcs were neod-
od. The 108 poian by the Peds stands
us it mark us well as the 202 points
by this two hardwood teams.

iWc'd like to jusl throw in our
thanks here to Bob Ashfield for
supplying us with oil the statistics

sweeping four points from the Van
Der-ace team. Duprey split the ma-
ples for a 467 triple to pace the
winners. while Cunningham was
the high scorer for the losers with
a 421 triple.

Sayles Win

The Rouscrs lost to the Sayles
squad, 3-1. In the other scheduled
match, Hilltop took a forfeit win
from Mahar's Groggers. The Grog-
gers are being dropped from this
league.

Both leagues have proven to be
close and well balanced so far. Even
the teams at the bottom of each
league. with the help of excellent
handicapping, have managed to pull
enough surprising upsets to keep
the leaders on their toes in every
match.

The Sport Spotlight casts il split

McDonald To Return

A bright notice for Coach Hath-
away as well as the team is the pos-
sibility that co-captain Jerry Mc-
Donald may return to action to—
night. Jerry’s foot injury has kept
him on the sidelines thus far this
year.

Figures compiled by APRB thus
far show Nels LaRoe tops iii scor-
ing with 79 points. He is closely fol-
lowed by Sig Smith and Lew Carr
who have both hooped in 74. Be-
sides being second rn scoring, big
Lew leads the Feds in rebounding
with 50 grabs. Speedster Denny
Dempster is the top playmaker with
13 assists thus for.

In the all indicative shooting per-
centages for the top scorers, Carr
has hit on 54% of his field goal at—
tempts. while Smith has a. 46% cf-
fort. Captain Nels LaRoe is close
behind Sig with 44'.’.'.

In foul shooting percentage Smith
is way out in front with 28 of 39.
The other two leaders, a surprise
to no one, are again Nels and Lew
with the 6 foot 6 inch center trail-
ing the deceptive ball handling La-
Roe, 20 to 25.
l’eds Trail Opponents

In State Vs. opposition tabulations
thus far. State trails its opponents

found the range for 137 out of 355.
In foul shooting the score stands:
State—180 attempts (with 113 suc-
cessful shotsr and opponents-482
(with 100 floating through the net).
Tire local eager-s trail in team totals
331 to 874.

Everything's Going
To The Dogs

How much was that poor dog
in the Commons?

The first day of second sem-
ester found a new student en-
rolled in the extra curricular
activities, around the campus.
Dagmar, the name of our new
pedigreed pcd, spent an en-
joyuble day bounding English
classes and cat napping in the
Commons.

Around lunchtime Dag visited
a neighborhood confectionery
shoppe with some hungry class-
mates. There she consumed
numerous meatballs and saucers
of milk. as well as, some tasty
snow shoes.

What is Dagmar? Who is she?
and where did she come from?
All are good questions but have
no answers. Wagering a guess,
we‘d say Dagmar entered the
world about four months ago.
The pathetic little pup is home
hunting.

Know anyone with an empty
(loghousc?
