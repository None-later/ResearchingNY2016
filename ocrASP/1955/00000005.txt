Just The Facts . . .

With this issue, a new News Board and new Editor
take over the management of the State College News, and
will reign until the beginning of second semester, 1956.
Since 1916 the State College News has maintained the
policy of accurately covering and reporting all news of
nterest to and concerning, the members of Student As-
sociation. The policy set up by the Class of 1918 when they
established the newspaper in 1916 reads as follows: “To
make each faction in our student organization know and
appreciate all others, to uphold the maintenance of fra-
ternal regard and friendly rivalry among all, to work for
cooperation between all sections and for the solidification
of the now separately wasted energies in the promotion of
a real, distinct, and enthusiastic spirit of loyalty to State
College.” I

We hope to continue to maintain this admirable policy
as effectively as our predecessors have done; to not only
reflect student opinion, but to lead it. The News is the

only organized means of communication existing on this , . ,

campus and it is run solely by students, with no faculty
advisor. It is a newspaper for, by, and of the students and
it is our responsibility to see that it remains so.

Because of a very small staff, it is necessary that the
members of Student Association, especially the people in
charge of organizations, cooperate with us fully. In order
to carry a full coverage on all activities it is advisable that
each organization submit its news to us on Tuesday after-
noon of each week. This will alleviate the work of the re-
porters, who at present must not only write the stories but
also search out the news. With your cooperation and help
the News will be able to expand and encompass more and
more areas of interest to the student body.

Council vs Myskania . . .

In the weekly Student Council meeting Wednesday
evening, the question of the forthcoming replacement elec-

tions arose and it was discovered that Myskania had de- .

cided that members of Student Association will vote by
absentee ballot rather than in Assembly. Their decision
rested on the fact that absentee voting would alleviate
technicalities for them and prevent the use of a system
of checks necessary to insure against students voting twice.
They were concerned with the fact that the new Assembly
seating chart is not yet out, and that confusion would oc-
cur in the attempt of students, who had a seat last semes-
ter and who either have classes or work this semester at
10 am. on Fridays, to vote absentee.

Student Council opposing this, argued that the elec—
tions are important enough to warrant everyone‘s voting
in Assembly. They maintained that there is time for such
people who are unable to attend Assembly this semester
to turn in their excuses and be granted permission to vote.

We agree wholeheartedly with Council. The elections,
to be held February 18, include voting for Junior Prom
Queen, selection of two members from the Junior Class
to fill vacant positions on Student Board of Finance, and
electing a new Publicity Director l'rom the Sephomore
Class. One of the purposes 01' the Assembly of the members
of Student Association is to transact business and vote in
all matters concerning the Association. Elections constitute
a very major part of their power and there is a much great-
er chance that more people will vote in Assembly than
will vote absentee.

When the petition f'rom Council, asking that all future
elections be conducted in Assembly and that absentee
voting be held only f'or people with legal excuses, is pre—
sented to Myskania Tuesday evening, we hope they will
heed it and reverse their decision. This decision afl'ects a
number of people and it" not withdrawn, may help to dis-
courage attendance at Assemblies!

' (We! Kapou
By CLIFF DAVIS

A gem from M-G-M—Bad Day At
Black Rock, with the Palace Thea-
ter playing host. Set Up behind the
modern day western town, Spencer
Tracy comes to liberate the place
of its fears and killers, at the same
time enacting the best role of his
career. Robert Ryan leads a distin-
guished cast in this Cinemascope bit.
A rcmaiitlc interlude, Trouble in the
Glen, with mystic Orson Welles in
the lead, will complete your night.

If you care to see Just what Cos-
tain put in his Silver Chalice, trot
into the Strand for a Cinemascopic
glimpse of the goings—on. Jack Pa-
iance, Paul Newman, Virginia Mayo
do their darndest to slight one an-
other. Attention fansi They also
have a ieaturette on hand called
well—never mind. Go see for
yourself and win a free Cadillac!

Before it slips my mind . . . we
have been asked to mention the
Boston Pops Orchestra will be at
RPI this eve with the ex-fiddier,
Fiedler, to conduct all kinds of nice
stuff. Seats $3.50 down to $1.50.

The Delaware Theater continues
to explode with hold-overs. Mr. Hu-
iot’s Holiday will give you a boil-
day in flicker merrlment if you and
your favorite care to cool over
there.

People haven't had enough of
White Christmas because the Madi-
son is extending the showing time.
I guess with snow on the ground a
person could stlLl enjoy the whole
affair, though.

Be seeing you! Be seeing movies!

440»: ‘7lte gilttaa’d
Maiden;

There was a time when we could
rely on just two things in life —
death and taxes. It seems now that
a third item should be added —
I.B.M. complications. We realize
that no one seems to be. responsi-
ble, officially, for the ridiculously
long time that we have to wait fol'
our marks. We have heard various
excuses ranging from the abnormal
amount of sun spots to the recent
cold spell. But—there has been no
explanation offered by the College
for this failure. We think that one
is in order.

It seems psychologically very poor
to have students, especially those
on probation, attend courses which
they might have failed. Poor, not
only for the students but also the
teachers.

If, and when, a student finds out
his marks and wants to transfer to
another college, it’s virtually lin-
possible to be accepted for this sem-
ester becouse of the late date.

It is always necessary at this
time ot' the year to make accommo-
deficits in the residence halls for
the new students coming in and
also to adjust ill relation to those
who lll'C not kcepillg the same resi-
dence l'or the following semester.
The indci'lnitencss of the marks sit—
tuition makes this problem more
complex and bothersome.

Muily students have it reasonable
complaint when it comes to buying
books for courses this semester. Not
knowing the certainty of their
schedules, they hold off buying
books until they lil‘L‘ more certain
of" thcir position. This leaves them
behind, its instructors shirt. giving
out ussisnments. The Co-op prob-
uhly feels this not only in lilltiiil
stiles but, iiiso to requests for re-
lunds on liookh.

Why should instructors be forced
to rush the marking oi' their po-
pcrs within ‘10 hours, when it. tukes
it good week to tell (toys to get
them out to the students?

i wonder if the oft-used system
of including it stomped Sl‘ll-tltltll’culi-

SC To Petition

Judicial Decision
Tuesday Evening

At the Student Council meeting
Wednesday evening, an Exchange
program was approved, a petition
to Myskania was adopted, and the
ring company to produce the tra-
ditional State rings was selected.

After approval of an exchange
program between Buffalo and A1-
bmiy, running from March 2
through 6, was secured, Robert
Betscha '56, Vice-President of SA,
moved that $75 be taken from sur-
plus to finance the exchange pro-
gram. If Student Board of Finance
met previous to the Assembly today,
this financial motion will be on the
agenda.

Council to Petition Myskania

Betscha moved that Student Coun-
cil request that Myskania hold all
elections in Assembly after the ab-
sentee voting scheduled for Feb-
ruarv 18. David Kendig ’57 pointed
out that the government of the
school is vested in the hands of the
Assembly, thereby stressing the need
for lioiding such elections in Assem-
bly. The motion was defeated.

Following the defeat of this mo-
tion, Frank McEvoy ’57 moved to
petition Myskanla to have replace-
ment and all further elections in
Assembly, with regular procedure for
absentee voting. The motion was
carried, and President Charles Beck-
with ‘55 will present the petition to
Mysknnla Tuesday.

Student Board of Finance, request-
ed aid froin Studelit Council to fa-
