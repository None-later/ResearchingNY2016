Menace-France, Melenlrov Fell,-
Bfulgonin Becomes USSR Premier

By M. A.

One thing we can rejoice in is
that future teachers do not have
the tenure of premiers. The French
are again playing musical chairs.
the difference being that the ones
sitting down have to face the mu-
sic. M. Mendes-France fell on the
North African question with the op-
position led by Rene Mayer, a Radi-
cal. It now seems that Antoine Pi-
nay will be approved by the Na-
tional Assembly. The government of
France is our business only in so
far as we are concerned with our
defense but we can rightly be very
concerned with the government 0
France when it is so disinterested
in our defense. If French milk, men-
tioned some weeks ago, has the same
effect as other French beverages, an
ingenious soul might be able to
avoid certain taxes.

The line about the bigger they
are surely was true this week, Pre-
mier Malenkov "resigned" and Mar-
shall Bulganing was unanimously
elected to the Chairmanship of the

TPB...

Council of Ministers by the Supreme
Soviet. The Kremlin seems to take
delight in keeping us guessing but
most experts are sure it is more
than a guess to say that Bulganin
is not running the show. Nikita
Khrushchev, secretary-general of
the Communist Party, is indeed the
man to be watched. In the resigna-
tion speech of Mr. Malenkov, there
is the manifestation of a complete
surrender of the Soviet government
to the economic policies of Mr.
Krushchev. Malenkov advocated em-
phasis on consumer’s goods whereas
Mr. Krushchev. following the policy
of Josef Stalin, favors heavy, war
industry and iron-handed, unre-
lenting diplomacy. What the policy
of the Soviet Union will be is not
known. One might well ask if Mar-
shal Bulganin was elevated in order
to execute the war-like plans of
Premier Krushchev. The guns or
the gallows may soon tell the story.

Music Theatre Plans

New Training School

The Oakdale Musical Theatre has
established a professional training
program for students of musical
theatre in Wallingford, Connecticut,
under the supervision of Bernard
Barrow, formerly Director of Dra-
ma at Lincoln University. Pennsyl-
vania.

The school’s first ten week sem-
ester will begin June 20, aiming at
the development of talent for the
musical stage. offering classroom
and pratical work in acting, sing-
ing, dancing and stagecraft.

The faculty, in addition to Barrow.
will include dance and music in-
structors, and will emphasize acting
techniques. stressing voice and dic-
tion; body movement, with daily
workouts in ballet.

 

 

The Minnesota Daily of Minne-
sota University published an article
which is of interest to anyone who
has, at one time or other. been at
the mercy of a dentist. It seems
that a new "supersonic" method of
drilling teeth is now being tested
at the University’s School of Den-
tistry. The instrument known as
the Cavitron, resembles the all too
well-known standard drill but the
effects on the patient differ drastic-
ally. An aluminum oxide solution
vibrated across the tooth is what
does the actual cutting. The vibra-
tion frequency is so high and its
amplitude so small that the patient
cannot hear the drill and. it is said,
is also scarcely able to feel it. Well,
you can"t say the world isn’t im-

brought forth their viewpoints, with
full discussion being heard before
any motion was made. Throughout
the discussion on this and other
matters, criticism was made by My-
skania members about Myskania.
and other Myskania members; crit-
icism that was accepted in a con-
structive manner. Following a re-
quest by a sorority president to
postpone the time of the next meet-
ing, because of sorority pledging,
the Chairman of Myskania closed
the remainder of the meeting.

It does not seem very ethical for
the Chairman to close the meeting
without a vote of the membership.
nor does it seem right for Myskania,
in view of their position and crowd-
ed agenda, to cater to the wishes of
the President or members of any
group.

With so many Sophomore and
Junior leaders being increasingly
“Myskania Conscious.“ and so many
of our school groups lacking school
good organization. it is regrettable
that more people in the school do
not find time to leave one Tuesday
night "free," and take advantage of
their opportunity to see the leader-
ship and decisive optimistic attitudes
present rn Myskania.

“The American Cancer Society

To reminisce a bit, The Daily Tar

tables up, and quench the fire, the

Cramming at 3 a.m.: “IIow weary.
stale, flat and unprofitable seem to
me all the uses of the world.”

Cramming at 7 a.m.: “It is not
for your health thus to commit your
weak condition to the raw, cold

Teacher handing out tests: “0

villain. smiling damned villain!"

Composition exam: “Why, I will
fight with him upon this theme un-
til my eyelids will no longer way."

And of course. the ever popular
leaky fountain pen: “Out. damned
spot! Out, I say."

Height Advantage to Utica

This was a very close game in
which the outcome was in doubt
until the final whistle. The over-

Utica squad began to count heavily
in the waning moments. This is the
second game in a row in which the
high scoring J.V. unit has scored
over 90 points.

Last Friday’s action saw the Jun-

three-quarters of the game.

The Feds started this game off
with a. rush as McDonald hooped in
8 of State’s first 10 points. With
the rest of the team chipping in
key shots, State led by as many 0
12 points in the first half. With
about seven minutes remaining in
the half, McDonald left the game
having scored 14 points. At half-
time the score was tied at 41 all.
John Rookwood, one of State’s lead-
ing scorers, and Ron Evans. one of
Utica's top point producers both
picked up four quick fouls which
handicapped them throughout the
second half.

Utes Lead by 19

In the third quarter Utica start-
ed to pull ahead and at one point
led by 19. The Peds were 18 down
with less than six minutes to go
when they began to Whittle aWay at
the lead. With McDonald and LaRoe
sparking this last ditch drive, the
team crept up to within three points
of the victors.

LaRoe ended the evening with 18
points in addition to capturing a
major share of State's rebounds. Mc-

_ Donald's 28 points was only two

shy of the Page Hall single game
scoring record by an Albany player.
Down New Paltz

Down 39-36 at the half and as
much as 16 points at one time, the
Feds went on to win Friday night’s
game against New Paltz 84-76. The
second half found LaRoe dropping
in 13, Smith 10. and Carr 12. Smith
led in the final tallies with 20. nos-
ing out LaRoe by one.

Saturday night it was a different
story as Ted Murray and his Oswego
teammates trounced the Albanians
94-74. About the only bright spot in
the game for the Feds was the per-
formance of Sig Smith who dropped
in 28 points. This pushed Smith 15
points ahead of Nels LaRoe prior
to Wednesday night's game.

The hoopsters will be in action
again tomorrow when they face
New Haven and Thursday when
they meet Plattsburg in Page.
