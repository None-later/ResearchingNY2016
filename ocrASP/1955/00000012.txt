Librory Exhibits '
Boole Collection

The showcase in the main reading
room of the Hawley Library con-
tains an exhibibt of an old book
collection by Alan R. Stephenson ’55,
states Alice T. Hastings, Assistant
College Librarian.

The exhibit contains the follow-
ing books from Stephenson’s col-
lection: a science book entitled “In-
visible Electric Fluid" which has
many early misconceptions regard-
ing electricty. A very complete his-
tory of early settlers in Saratoga
County which covers industries and
developments may be found in Syl-
gegter’s “History of Saratoga Coun-
y .

The oldest piece of literature in
the collection which was published
in 1706. is the “Dialogues of the
Dead." This book contains conver-
sation as might have occurred be-
tween famous people from differ-
ent periods in history. An original
copyright, “Romola,” one of two
volumes by George Elliott which
ﬁaﬁtpublished in 1883 is also on ex-

Another book which was publish-
ed in 1807 “Dialogues in Chemistry"
contains a dialogue between
the tutor and pupils who makes
interesting attempts at explaining
the unknown knowledge of several
scientific discoveries which occur
later in the century.

China has refused to cbnsider a'
ceasefire or send a delegate to dis-
cuss the question. Meanwhile, con-y
versations continued on a Russian
proposal for a ten-power conference
on the problem.

Red China was not inclined to
tangle with the U. s. 7th Fleet last
week, as the Tachen Islands were
evacuated without serious mishap.
In Congress. the question of which
islands we are committed to defend
was raised.

The big news on the labor front
was the merger of the AF of L and
the CIO after a twenty-year split.
CIO President, Walter Reuther step-
ped aside as George Meaney of the
AF of L became president of both
unions. Considerable talk is devel-
oping about a possible labor party.

Press Bureau Elects
New Editorial Boar

Press Bureau's new board mem-
bers for this semester have been
announced, notifies Esther Gold-
stein '58, Director.

The new Board members of Press
Bureau are: Yolanda Aufiero, Louise
Uva, Juniors; Joann Kazmercik, Bar-
bara Weinstock, and Susan Cun-
ningham, Sophomores.

Miss Goldstein further reminds
students to complete their notices
which were sent through student
mall last Week. These notices are
the basis from which hometown
newspapers are notified by the Bu-
reau.

Now,?‘sucli prophecies taken alone
are certainly harmless and tolerable,
but when they are garnished with
specious reasoning and emotional
appeals, so as to lend to the proph-
,ecy the dignity of a deduction, they
become downright dishonest.

Personally, I feel that fraternal
organizations cannot be abolished
by just ah‘administratlve order, no
mattenwha't its source. If the fra-
ternal'Spirit prevails, it will mani-
fest itself in secret organizations
and activities. As a case in point,
the State College Society of Radi-
cals, Atheists and Free Thinkers is
one such secret fraternal organiza-
tion which had to have its 'birth
underground, due to the extreme
adverse pressure anticipated from
various social and governmental
agencies.

With reference to the other edi-
torial greasing the “fiasco of the
tardy ﬁnal marks, in her argument
the Chief used the fact that Syra-
cuse niversity took two years to
adapt itself to the IBM system, but
neglected to state that Syracuse
has a student body of more than
ﬁve times ours—~a signiﬁcant omis-
sion. Further. her". bringing to light
the fact that: “It was estimated
that it would be a year before State
could fully adapt (to the IBM sys-
' m) . . . " seems to argue that the
delay of issuance of grades was an-
ticlpatecl, but nobody did anything
about it. The easy hindsight reme-
dy, of course, would have been to
send out the grades via the postal
card system thereby permitting
loads of time to de—bug the IBM
system.

677 To Shatter

intramural Kegling Loop Marks

Records were broken fast and
furiously in the Intramural Bowling
League this week with only one keg-
ler responsible for it all. Joe Du-
ran, little in stature but mighty
in State’s Bowling circles, came
up with an unbelieveable 877 trip-
le including an almost perfect game.
Bowling as though he had no re-
gard for existing marks, the APA
anchorman sank existing SL8 from
a top contender to practically an
also-ran. Joe started out with a
188 opener and finished a “fair”
day with a 210. It was the middle
game that gave Duran his chance
to put his name at the top of all
bowling lists. Joe came up with a
279 game. He started his big game
with four straight strikes. In the
fifth frame, the five pin failed to
carry and the wavering pin had to
be taken care of via the spare me-
thod. Hitting the pocket as con-
sistently as though it were a kid's
game, he added 7 more strikes.

The seasonal alley record at Rice’s
was tied with his high single, heat-
ing out all men's league marks. Be-
sides this, Duran made a farce of
Joe Swierzowski's previously high
games of 225 and a 574 triple. He
has thus assured himself of getting
at least one of the trophies. In per-
sonal averages, Joe added 7 more
points to his and easily climbed to
the top of the loop with a 172 aver-
age.

In team records, Joe received good
backing from all his teammates with
scores ranging from 469-490. They
thus broke their own records as

 

Fencing Class
Meets Tuesday
In Milne Gym

By PAUL GORMAN

Experienced fencers are needed
for a meeting at the Milne Gym
on the night of the 22nd. At that
time, plans for an intramural fenc-
lng league will be discussed. If your
interest in fencing hasn't faded, and
if you still have a bit of the old
spring left, come on down to the
Milne Gym and put your ideas
across to the other fencers. The
meeting will start at 8:30 and will
last till about 9:30. For all of the
would-be swordsmen. (and ladies)
there will be classes held in the
same place, the Milne Gym, at 8:30
pm. on Wednesday nights. Be sure

to bring your sneakers and wear old
clothes.

Hellenbeclt Rolls 514
In Sunday Night Loop

In the Mixed Bowling League last
Sunday Jean Hallenbeck came up
with a 514 triple on games of 170-
175-169. She thus became a member
of the Eleventh Frame First Club.
The Club consists of all women in
organized bowling leagues who have
hit 500 for the first time in their
careers. For her feat Jean will re-
ceive a free dinner from Rice's
Bowling Alleys where the action
took place. Jean is very active in
bowling. being bowling manager for
the W.A.A.

The Mixed Bowling League has
lust pased its fifth week with Dick
Erbaeher as its head. other officers
include Mary Smith, Vice President.
and Gina Hilflkor as Secretary.

 

they came through with 779-981-
909—2849.

The SLS team, victims of the ex-
hibition, now have been virtually
eliminated from retaining their Al-
pha League crown. The staggering
frat men were led by Tom Shuman-
ski’s 510.

EEP Takes 4

Meanwhile EEP remained two
games back of the front runners by
winning a four point forfeit victory.
Bernie 'I'heobold, one of the hottest
bowlers throughout the last few
weeks again came up with a good
score, hitting 157-190-182-528.

In the final match downstairs, KB
and Sayles split with Leo Legault’s
454 standing as the best perform-
ance of the match.

Rousers, Summit Victors

The Upstairs League, receiving the
vibrations of Duran's pin smashing
blow, saw the Rousers and Summit
take four each from the Apaches
and Hilltop respectively with Van-
deraee bowing 3-1 to Sayles.

The Ranger-Apache mulch saw
Ron Vernoy come up with a 443
triple to beat the Apaches Pollto
by 6 pins.

Frank Swirskey again paced Hill-
top though his efforts went in vain.
Simonds led Summit by splitting the
maples at a 416 clip, one less than
Swirskey.

to be eligible for the position, you
nmst be a Senior. Elections will
take place Tuesday in lower Hus-
ted from 9 to 3. Those nominated
so far are Al Stephenson, Bill Lind-
berg, and Chuck Derwin.

I. M. Track Planned

A new movement is getting un-
derway to start Intramural track
ai State College. The idea was first
brought up at one of the Fresh-
mun class meetings and was taken
from there to M.A.A. It has been
felt that if some good Intramural
track teams were formed, and
cnomh interest was shown, track
might develop into a varsity sport
in u few years.

Sign Up Sheets Posted

Sign up sheets are being sent
around to all the dorms, and all
those interested should sign up as
soon as possible. If there are any
questions about the formation of the
teams. consult Joe Barton '53.

 

Ponies, Finks, Post Hoop Victories
To Maintain Undeleated Records

This week's Intramural Basket-
ball activity was somewhat limited
due to a rash of forfeits and the
intervention of the Factulty Con-
cert. Two exciting overtime wins
were recorded, however, by Snylcs
and the Finks.

Sayles topped EEP by one point,
50-49. in the tough Albany League.
Carl Maxson. this week's Sports
Spotlight runner-up, tossed in exact-
ly half of his team's total to pace
Snyles. The bulk of EEP‘s scoring
was done by Coan, Taggcrt, and
Kelly, who had 12, 12. and 10 points
respectively.

The third game played in the Al-
bany League was a rather unusual
0111'. EEP, playing with only four
,nu-u. managed to squeeze out a 52-
18 win over the fully manned Lem-
ons. O'Loughlin was the high scor-
er for the undcrmanned EEP squad
with 18 points. The Lemons, who
allowed numerous scoring oppor-
tunities to squirt away from them,
were led by Schultes, who also
swishvd in 18 points.

in one of the crucial contests of
the 'I‘L-uchcrs League, the undefeat-
1(l Summit House team met the un—
dvfluled Finks squad. Both clubs.

:i‘l-ull tie at the end of the regula-
ll )il four quarters. In the live min—
qu merinnv period. the Finks pull-
ed away to a 44-37 victory. The
mixing for the Finks was mostly
done, by Baker, Schatzle, and Krch-
iziuk who scored 12. 1:3, and 11
iqtil-x-r. However, Ira Goldstcin oi'
the 105015 was the high man in the
contest. scoring 21 points. in addi-
tion to doing some fine rebounding.

State Grapplers
Deleat Darrow
Academy 36-5

The Wrestling Team evened its
record at one win and one loss last
week with a sparkling showing
against Darrow Academy. State took
all the matches except one, and ma-
naged to end up with a decisive
36 to 5 score over the visiting team.

Five State men pinned their op-
ponents during the match. They
were Wayne Harvey, 123 pound
class; Bob Bosomworth. 15’? pound
class; Bob Dreher, 167 pound class;
Dave Goldberg, 177 pound class, and
Bill Gropp in the heavyweight divi-
sion. Lee Negus won by default
over his opponent in the 147 pound
class, and Bindrim dcclsioned his
mun at 121 pounds.

State traveled to Darrow last
night for a rematch, and will also
see action Saturday as they play
host to R.P.I.

l s... 3......

After watching Joe Duran’s bowl-
ing exhibition Wednesday afternoon.
there is little question as to who
should occupy the position in Sports
Spotlight of the week in this edition.
Joe broke all kinds of records on
the alleys as he came through with
a brilliant 677 triple and a high 279
single. Both his triple and single
game scores surpass the high marks
here at State this year and in past
years. His high single also tied this
year’s record at
Alleys.

Helps APA Take Four

With this brilliant display of alley
know how, he was able to lead his
team to games of 779, 961 and 909
scores. and a grand total of 2649
pins, another record here at State.
The APA men thus took four points
from the SL5 keglers and managed
to retain their two game lead in
the Alpha League.

 

Runner-up—Carl Maxson

This week’s runner-up for Sport-
llght honors is freshman Carl Max-
son, high scoring forward for the
Sayles hoop squad. Carl scored 25
points to lead his team to a one
point overtime victory over EEP.

Rice's Bowling A

his efforts were tWo points many
of the all-time Page Hall mark
for a local cageer. Bill Hiram Wal-
ker set the mark in the 51-52 sea:
son against Plattsburg and last
year’s hoop fans had the .opportuni-dl
ty to cheer John Centra as he tied
the mark with 30 tallies against
Utica.  .~

Having played Plattsburg STC
last night, the teachers remain at
home when they take on Pratt Irr-
stitute tomorrow. The game is sche-
duled to get underway immediate-
ly after the 7:00 preliminary. Last
year the Pratt hoopsters bowed to
Coach Merlin Hathaway's" men by
the score of 89-88. (The score for
yesterday's game could not be in-
cluded in this issue because of the
Wednesday night deadline.)

McDonald was not alone in his
Saturday night performance as a
late drive was sparked by Jack Mi-
non, Don Mayer and co-captain
Nels La Roe. The final score (92-84)
was out very much from the 20
point deficit the Purple and Gold
cagers were up against a little ear-

her.

New Haven Leads At Half

The first half was quite a battle
as the lead switched teams several
times. The scoreboard at the half
finally rend 44-40 in favor of New
Haven. It was State's tenth loss
against two wins.

The Junior Varsity squad mean-
while came through on the short
