The existing varied troubles of
Student Union Board can be traced
fundamentally to two problems. The
ﬁrst is the extraordinarily bad con-
stitution, and set of rules under
which they operate. The second is
the organization and attitudes of
the. present 15 members of the
Board, who seem to be afraid to
execute in any direct way their re-
sponsibilities. ‘

The set of rules that are in effect
now, governing the use of . the Stu-
dent Union are seldom, if ever, en-
forced. It is extremely unlikely that
they could be, not only because of
their ambiguity. but because no-
where in their constitution do they
provide for any sort of enforcement
regulations. Likewise, their consti-
tution evades an issue that sooner
or later must be answered. What
comprises the Student Union, and
who is in charge of it?

The members of the Board, a self-
perpetuating group, seem to feel
generally that they are on the Board
for the glory, rather than for the
work involved. In enforcing one of
their rules, a series of letters-to-the-
offenders has been proposed, rather

seam  ' ‘  ‘

By DAVID KENDIG '

than the method of simply issuing
warnings. in, part, to alleviate caus-
ing their "friends" embarrassment.

These two main difficulties were
present at the last meeting of the
Board on Sunday night. Dealing
with the problem of “amorous .mani-

‘ festations," a‘great deal'Of time was

spent ‘in what can'be at best de-
scribed only as a'burlesque discus-
sion. Their solution to‘th'e problem
as‘ a sort of hazy 'idea, whereby
these "letters" would be sent cut
to violators of the rule, which is in
turn equally hazy. It was specified
that this ruling wasvnot to go into
the constitution, but only into the
minutes of the meeting;

If they can solve their question of
authority, revise their rules, state
their powers, realize that 15 people
cannot police the Union, the sort
of predicament they are in now
could easily be alleviated. It would
seem wiser for them to start send-
ing warnings to their own members,
clarifying their duties and jurisdic-
tion, before they start sending let-
ters to the rest of us, for violating
rules, the existence of which are not
even known.
