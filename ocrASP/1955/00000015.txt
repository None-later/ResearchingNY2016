Dramatics and Arts Council will

The exhibit will be open daily
from 9 am. until 4 pm. It will also
be open during the evenings of
March 11 and 12. the nights that the
State College Theatre is presenting
“Girls in Uniform."

schools as large as ours are and

I would further like to inform the
ignorant that this is not a ration-
alization (i.e. Commonstater,
2/18/55). At the moment, it looks
as“ though the 1955 Pedagogue will
not come out as scheduled—May,
1955, but the reason for that is a
bankruptcy condition of one of the
firms that we have been doing bus-
iness with. The firm has had a fine
reputation, and of course, neither
faculty or staff members of the
Pedagogue had any idea that they
would not be able to fulfill their
obligations.

Since the Commonstater’s well
informed smu'ce was myself, I would
also like to suggest that they do
less speculating on FACTS that are
given to them. Since they are also
extremely unaware of the problems
of the publishing field, I do think
they have little right to criticize
and should concern themselves with
the facts that are supplied by those
who are in the know.

The prints of the Flemish Brnegh-
el of the sixteenth century and the
Dutch Rembrandt of the seven-
teenth reveal intimate everyday
scenes and human activities. He-
garth of England and Goya of Spain
point up the foibles and disasters

willing to accept the work and re-
sponsibility that goes wth this office.
This school has given me a lot, more
than I can repay—but there is one
thing I can do. I can try with the
best of my ability to bring order out
of chaos, to instill life into a dying
organization on Campus, and to try
and make you people realize that
this is your school and its a school
that you should be proud of. Pride
in your school is a necessity for
without it all other efforts to im-
prove the school would be wasted.

“I intend to achieve these ends
by intelligent planning and physical
stimuli. If I feel that an evil can
be remedied by intelligent dscussion
and planning then I will do so. But
if I see the need to boot some one
or some organization in the tail in
order to bring it in line with the
wishes of the assembly I'll not heis-
tate to do so.

“This is the time for action. The
school is in the midst of countless
changes. We must not let our Stu-
dent Government sink to such a sad
level that we run the risk of losing
our claim to the right of self-gov-
ernment.

“My platform is short and simply
stated but entails a lot of work.

“1. To mold Student Council into
a more productive group and help
them realize their potential by con-
ducting orderly and business-like
meetings.

"2. By acting as an ex-officio
member of all organizations on cam-
pus I will do all in my power to
make them work together toward a
common goal, namely the better-
ment of State College.

“3. I will attempt to restore the
assembly to the high position that
it once had. namely as the place
where students had both a right and
an obligation to intelligently decide
how their government should be
run.

“4. Lastly, I will promise to keep
you. the assembly, well informed
about what I and your representa-
tives are doing for you and for the
school."

 

Pyschology Club
Hears Lecture
On Delinquency

At the Tuesday night meeting of
the Psychology Club at Brubacher,
David M. Friedland, a Clinical Psy-
chologist at the Berkshire Industrial
Farm, gave a lecture on Depressed
Environment, states Donald Howard
’57, Presrdent.

The Berkshire Industrial Farm is
a private institution which rehabil-
itates delinquents which have been
assigned to them by the court. It
is supported by the courts and
charity. The detention system is not
used at the farm and the inmates
are not restrained by bars. The in-
stitution uses instead the reward-
punishment theory, liberties being
granted on merit.

The children live in separate cot-
tages which provide a home-like
atmosphere. The inmates attend
school during the day.

The next meeting of the Psychol-
ogy Club will be Tuesday, March 8.
The discussion topic will be "Com-
munication and Personality."

many ideas were mulled over regard-

One group already contacted for
the affair is State’s Wrestling squad.
Joe Garcia and his wrestlers have
agreed to put on a half time exhib-
ition at the hoop encounter.
Varsity Club to Aid

The Varsity Club has been ap-
proached as to the posibility of their
contributing their concession from
“coke” to the fund. Brochures of
the cage team will likewise go for
sale at the game.

After the game the SUB dance
will be held, at which time contri-
butions will be taken.

Because of the short duration of
time in which the planning must be
done. many plans are tentative. A
complete report will appear in next

5,1»: spa-9.42 I

This week the Sports Spotlight
thrusts, its ray on two red hot keg-
lers: Tom Shumanski and Joe Dur-
an. Both men rolled high triples to
lead their respective teams to im—
portant four point victories.

Big “Shu” split the pins for a 555
triple compounded from consistent
184-184-187 single games. Tom raised
his already high average a notch in
addition to providing the spark for
a four point SLS victory.

Jose Duran. league leader in aver-
age. had another good day scoring a
545 triple from single games of 1'76-
169 and 200. Joe was the key to APA's
four point sweep over second place
Potter Club. This victory put APA
six games in ﬁrst place.

 

Quintet Aims
For Comeback
Alter Poor Start

State's basketball team is learn-
ing the hard way that points scored
in the first half are Just as import-
ant as though hooped in the second
period. If the first half scores of
every game were to be deleted from
the scorebooks. State’s present 2-12
record would read 8 victories and
6 defeats. So it was Saturday when
State, being on the short end of a
39-32 halftime score came on to out-
score Pratt 44 to 35 in the second
half only to fall three points short
of adding another victory in the
record books. The final score was
78-76.

The hoopsters will take to the road
tomorrow when they Invade N.Y.8.
Maritime Academy. After their re-
turn to Albany they will play host
to Onconta State Teachers Tuesday.
Coach Hathaway and his men will
be out to avenge their earlier loss
to the southern teachers.

In their game Saturday the Feds
were on the short count all the way.
but came within a field goal of
tying the highly favored Institute.
Freshman Jack Minon was the in-
dividual scoring leader for the 10-
cals as he dropped in 21 points. The
old stalwart, Sig Smith and Nels
LaRoe. backed the first year man
with 18 each. _

Budouva Scores 45

Scoring honors of the encounter,
however. were taken by a jump shot
arist. Joe Bodouva, as he connect-
ed l’or 15 fields via the Jump shot
route.

In the JV game State managed to
squeak past the Courtesy Mart by a
score of 88-86. Four statesmen hit
double figures. All honors of the
game went to Fernando, however,
who netth 45 points for the eve-

ning.
