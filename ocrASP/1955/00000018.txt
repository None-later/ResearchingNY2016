Committee Resolves Differences
Between Congressional .Pay Bills

By A. B. STEPHENSON

l

Finances, always a problem, held
a large share of the spotlight this
week. A Joint committee of the

Institute Offers
Graduate Award

Kenneth Holland, President of the
Institute of International Education
in New York, announced that fel-
lowships for the study in Denmark
and Sweden have been offered to
American graduate students of the
1955-56 year by the Scandinavian
Governments.

Three fellowships have been of-
fered by the Danish Government
through the Ministry of Education.
These include funds for a year of
study in an institution of higher
education as well as expenses to
cover a short orientation course.
Since the number of supplementary
travel grants is limited, grantees
should have funds to pay for their
travel and expenses.

Through the Swedish-America
Foundation, the Swedish Govern-
ment is giving three fellowships
administered in the United States
by the Institute of International Ed-
ucation and the American-Scandin-
avian Foundation. The stipends cov-
er room, board, and tu1tion at a
Swedish university.

Candidates under 35 are given
preference. The other eligibility re-
quirements are: (1) U. S. citizen-
ship; (2) a bachelor’s degree from
an American college or university
of recognized standing at the time
of departure; (3) academic ability
and capacity for independent
study; (4) good moral character,
personality, and adaptability; (5)
good health.

Applications may be secured from
the United States Student Depart-
ment of the Institute of Interna-
tional Education. The final date for
the competitions is April 1, 1955.

 

 

House and Senate finally resolved
the differences between the two
Congressional pay-raise bills. The
legislators settled for a flat raise
of $7,500 with no increase in other
benefits. Most of the Federal Judi-
ciary also received raises.

In a surprise move, the House
passed a bill providing for a $20 per
person out in income taxes. This
was attacked by President Eisen-
hower and the Secretary of Treas-
ury, Mr. Humphrey, as untimely and
inflationary. The Senate apparently
agrees, as it seems certain to kill
the measure. Although it would
clearly be popular with the low in-
come group, the shadow of deficit
spending is cast over every tax cut.

0n the international scene, France
settled down with another short-
run premier, M. Faure. Since he was
forced to make a coalition of several
parties, he seems destined to fall
with his predecessors as soon as he
displeases one of these groups. _

Germany seems on the verge of
following France‘s footsteps, as its
regime woboled on several issues.
’lnese all hinged on the problem of
rearmament and the old sore point,
the Saar basin. The Germans have
accepted the Paris Arms Agreement
and now must pass a group of about
forty bills putting it into action.
France is demanding the interna-
tionalizlng of the Saar as the price
for rearmament. This always brings
trouble.

The Russians got into the political
shuffle, as seven men were elevated
in rank. It is interesting to note
that among them is Anastas Miko-
van who only last month was de-
moted, just prior to the fall of Ma-
lenkov.

In the state government, Gover-
nor Hari‘iman dropped his demand
for a two cent a gallon tax increase
on gasoline. This was to have taken
effect on April 1. Instead it appears
certain that the increase will begin
next January 1, as proposed by the
Republican legislature.

Hilltop Squeezes
Lemons ln Hoop

By ARNIE NEWMAN

The Intramural Basketball season,
plagued with postponements. ground
to a near standstill this week. A
combination round - robin - double
elimination tournament set up by
league managers Jim Estraniontc
and Bcrnlc Baker will take the place
of a second round of hoop play.

This tournament opened Wednes-
day with a game between Hilltop
and the Lcmons. Hilltop won this
game easily by a score of 61-41. Carl
Schrader split the cords for 25
points to load Hilltop. Wands chip-
ped in with 14 to help put the game
on ice for the barracks lnen. Schul—
tes. the consistent high scorer for
the Lcmons, again paced his team
with 14. Goldie backed him up with
11 points.

Managers Overcome Obstacles

his year flic 1M Basketball man-
agcrs have had to overcome almost
insurmountublc obstacles in sched-
uling. An unusual liumbcr of im-
portant school functions have taken
place this your in Page on Monday
and Wednesday evenings, and Sat-
urday afternoons: all of these have
either 1' :d or take precedence over
IM basketball forcing innumerable
postponcmcnts. In addition, AMIA
has failed to set up a rcfcrecing
board for this league, and the C0111-
peting teams have been relatively
lax in providing referees for games
which thcy were scheduled to offic-
iate. The scheduling problem is
probably unsolvablc, but the league
could be tremendously improved by
more cooperation from both AMIA
board and the competing teams.

again falls on a freshman, Carl
Schroder, Hilltop hoopster who has
been selected because of his perfor-
mance in a cage game against the
Lemons. Carl hooped in 25 points
against the Lemons givng his team
a 61-41 win. What's more important
is the fact that it was a playoff
game.

Runnerup for the week is Bruce

State‘s most effective weapon was
the fast break, which broke Oneon-
