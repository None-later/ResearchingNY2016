Joe Garbarino's 39 Overshadows

Minon's Record Tying 30 Points

Jack Minon must have been wondering just what one
has to do to be the most talked of eager after the final
buzzer had sounded in Saturday night’s hoop game against
Harpur. The freshman star found himself hooping in thirty
points, tying a Page Hall mark and at the same time con-
ceding game honors to Joe Garbarino. Joe had a mere 39.

JV's End Year
Wlll‘l 85-71 Loss

Roxy Cleaners wrung State’s Jay-
vees through the wringer last Sat-
urday night, downing the Jayvees
85-71. It was State’s last game for
this season.

Sandy Bernstein led State's attack,
with 18 points.

Conley of Roxy was high man for
the evening with 26 points.

Roxy's superior height was the
deciding factor in the game, as they
controlled the backboards consist-
ently.

Roxy Gains Early Lead

State never cauglitup to the early
Roxy lead. At half-time they were
behind 44-31. In the last half, Ron
Graves found the range and wound
up with 14 points. but it was not
enough to close the wide Roxy lead.

In a seventeen game schedule the
Jayvees compiled a record of seven
wins and ten losses.

This week‘s Sports Spotlight

beams on Tito Guglielmone, high
scoring forward on the Potter bas-
ketball squad. Tito swished in an
impressive 34 points to lead Potter
Club to a 66—35 victory over the
Phantoms.

Tito, who guards the nets for
State's varsity Soccer team. has
shown himself to be a versatile as
well as an outstanding athlete. He
should be a key man in Potter's
drive for the Intramural Basket-
ball championship.

In the midst of the two-man scoring
exhibition the State hoopsters went
down to their ninth straight loss.
closing their 1954-55 season with a
low 2-16 mark.

The locals pulled off to a fast 8-2
lead on McDonald's drive, a set and
foul by Minon and Sig Smith's driv-
ing lily-up, preceded by Nels La-
Roe's successful foul shot. The
Statesmen maintained their lead
until 10:29 of the period when Gar-
barlno knotted the score at 23 all.
Smith's set.—State‘s temporary lead
—~was erased by Reynolds’ jump and
two of Gabarino's 18 foul shots.
Harpur then hed the lead for 6
minutes until the clock showed 4:25.
Jack Minon put through a set and
two more fouls to push State to a
37-36 lead. Burnes' foul at 2:08 gave
the lead back to Harpur and it was
theirs to hold for the rest of the
encounter.

Harpur Holds Half Lead

Starting the second half on the
short end of a 42-49 score, the
statesmen rolled back to within
three points of their opponents on
Minon's set and a jump by none
other than Jack again.

Five minutes later the Feds started
another drive as Smith dropped in
a foul. Minon followed with two
more and added his “much looked
for" set. Joe Anderson's drive
brought the teachers to within a
point of Harpur's 62.

Minon Tied Record

The cagers then played even-
Stephen until a minute and thirty-
four seconds remained. Here a tech-
nical was called on Garbarino for
disagreeing with the man in grey.
Jack Minon was allowed to shoot
the foul and tie the record of 30
points by a Statesman in Page Gym.
Centia and Walker share the record
with Jack.
