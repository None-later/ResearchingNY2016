Outstanding Portrayals, Staging
Characterize 'Girls In Uniform

By JOHN LAING

As its contribution to Interna-
tional Theatre Month, D&A Coun-
cil presented the State College Thea-
tre production of the German play,
Girls in Uniform, by Christa Wins-
loe. Directed by Dr. Pettlt, the pre-
sentation was one worthy of the
auspices under which it was given.
Filled with outstanding and interest-
ing portrayals, and technically done
to perfection, this was indeed an
evening well spent in the theatre.

The script, at times tedious due
to repetition of emotional experience,
was enhanced by the brilliant stag-
ing executed by Charles Crowder.
The use of the three-level stage was
most effective, especially in the cre-
ation of some stage pictures long
worthy of remembrance. Aiding the
properties and stage setting was the
outstanding lighting plan which
heightened the dramatic effect of
some of the highlights of the per-
formance. I remember in particular
the scene in which Eleanor Gold-
man 1Kesten) confronted Barbara
Maaloe (Edelgard) in the corridor
outside of Fraulein von Bernburg's
room. The shadowy sinisterness of
this scene was created mainly by
the lighting effects, ably abetted by
the actresses. The skillful execution
of lights aided the smoothness of
the show through the precision slid-
ing from one scene to the next

ICA Committee

ICA held a meeting last Thursday
at Brubacher to discuss the former

Home Easter Party will be the main

merely by a change in the area of
the lighted portion of the stage.

This play is written with one per-
son in mind. Although it has many
interesting and challenging roles. it
is the part of Manuela which de-
mands the majority of the aud-
ience‘s attention and sympathy.
This role was excellently portrayed
by Paula Sega] in her debut with
the State College Theatre. Playing
a fourteen-year-old girl is no small
job, and through an adolescent
overindulgence in emotions. Miss
Segal’s performance rang true. A
complete understanding of the play
can only evolve from a realization
that Manuela is only fourteen, and
if this fact was forgotten, the play
would lose its delicate, beautiful
story of a youngster's love and
adoration of the adult hero who em-
bodies all she hopes to be and feels
her mother was. Without this recog-
nition, the play becomes merely
the story of a mentally sick person;
it is surely far more than that in
the gentle handling it presents of
the emotions of a sensitive young
girl and those with whom she lives.

Jean Shaw, as the recipient of
Manuela's devotion. gave a good per-
formance. She gained in stature as
the play progressed and ended her
role in some well-delivered, thor-
oughly convincing lines which she
surely believed. In the early scenes
of the play. Miss Shaw was some-
what weaker, as ls the entire script.
The Iirst act is a slow one, and the
actors could have done no more
than they did to keep it alive.

Excellent contributions were made
to the play's overall effectiveness
by Adriana Bosna. Vern Freund, Jean
Morris, Roberta Stein, Barbara Maa-
loe. Sondra Schechter, Maxine Ad-
ner, and Eleanor Goldman. Miss
Bosna had one of the most thor-
oughly and consistently perfect por-
trayals that has been seen in some
time. Incidentally, her make-up job
was superior. The Misses Goldman
and Maaloe did not at all times get
the full force which their roles a1—
lowod. Miss Goldman’s characteriza-
tion somehow seemed incomplete,
since there was no definiteness in
her role. At times she seemed sym-
pathetic, only to have this indefin-
ite quality completely disappear in
her next appearance. Margaret Cul-
llgan turned in an excellent per—
formance in the role of Ilse. Much
of the comic relief was due to her
convincing delivery of the lines with
which her completely understood
character was endowed.

STATE COLLIGI Nm.‘FRIDAY. MARCH IO. 10!!

 

Wad ‘74!

By BOB ASHFIELD

Looking back on the not too dis-
tant basketball season, we can look
to our statistics to tell us just
“what happened" and what we may
expect next season.

The won-lost record of 2-16 re-
corded this year is the worst ever
posted by a Hathaway team, dating
back to the spring of 1946 when
State won 4 and lost 5. Basketball
had been interrupted by the war
and was resumed in February of
1946.

Regardless of whether a team
loses by 1 point or by 20. it still
goes in the deficit column. but at
least ithcrc is some personal satis-
faction at looking at all the ones
that “might have been.“ All in all.
State lost 2 games by 1 point. 3 by
2 points and 12 of the 16 losses
were by 8 points or 1ch. In the
string of 8 losses which closed the
season, State's opponents combined
outs-cored them by only 29 points.
less than 4 points per game.

We can‘t honestly say that a team
posting the above records while av-
eraging 39.4'1 of their shots frcm
the field and shooting 60.6'; of
their fouls had a bad season. With
a few whistles at the right time
and a little luck. it could have been
a 14-4 season.

On the personal sidc. co-cnptuin
Nels LaRoe walked off with most of
the honors. In LiiRzii"s iln‘cc Sca-
sons at Siaic sincr transferring
from Sicnu, he has 88-1. points to his
credit.

Gerry McDonald. who along with
LnRoe will be handing over his co-
captain dutics bccnusc ol gradua-
tion, conic on 10 hflVL‘ a fine si-zison

time, should really come into his
own as a. Senior and add to his 529
points. Only John Centre, State’s
great scorer last year, holds a bet-
ter two-year record with 552 points.
Centra had the advantage of two
more contests though.

Jack Minon, who began to find
himself at the end of the season,
featured by his record tieing 30
points against Harpur, is the steady
ballplayer any club needs. Jack can
be a very important man for State
next year.

John Rookwood and Joe Anderson,
who we think experienced the
"sophomore jinx", are capable of
breaking loose for a season compar-
able to their great first one as J.V.
men.

Denny Dempstcr proved the small
man has a place on the court util-
izing his great speed and ball hawk-
ing ability. A tremendous passer,
watch for Denny‘s assist total to
go up next year.

Mayer Big- Man

Don Mayer. the height for next
year at 6‘4", may have found the
transition from high school to col-
lege a little tough at first, but
seemed to be finding himself at
the cud of the season. We look for
Don. a hard worker. to really de-
vclop next year.

Bruce King and Jack Peacock.
two men who although seeing little
action this year, possess the ability
to jump right into a starting line-
up and their hustle will never hurt
any team.

Men who will get a good look at
.i varsity berth next year from Bob
Suge's squad are the two top scor-
crs. They are both little men at 5'8".
Srph Sandy Bernstein hooped 269
points in 17 contests and Harry Mil-
lctt. a freshman who led the J.V.
scoring until injured, added 212 tal-
lies in 14 appearances.

Also possessing varsity ability are
Roll Graves, Tom Briei'ly. Joe Zizzi,
and Kt‘lill Olson. At this point 01-
son looks like the best prospect.
Playing only second semester, Keith
averaged 15 a game, topped by his
30 in State‘s upset victory over ABC.

Ponies, EEP, Potter Advance

To Finals In Basketball Playoffs

Potter Takes I
Lead In Kegling

In the Downstairs Bowling Lea-
gue APA lost its first place posi-
tion to Potter this week as Potter
rolled over APA 3% to it. The frac-
tion of the point occurred when
APA's last man. Joe Duran, man-
aged to tie the score of the second
game with two strikes and nine
pins in the last frame. However,
Duran's efforts played only second
fiddle to Potter's Dave Borden who
sparked his team with a 597 triple.
Borden thus captured second place
in high scoring honors this season.
The victory moves Potter into first
place by two games over APA. In
another Downstairs bowling con-
test. Tom Shumanskl's high 193
single and 543 triple as well as
John Zi-dik's 506 triple were basic—
ally essential in the 4-0 victory of
SLS over the Saylesmen. KB also
picked up four games as a result
of a forfeit. Smith hit a high 506
triple for the frat-men.

 

Summit Gains Top

First place changed hands in the
Upstairs League also. Here the surg-
ing Summit House team overpow-
ered the Rousers, 4-0. In this match
Bill Rock split the maples for a 485
triple for the Rousers. Tom DiGes-
are was once again Summit's high
man. This time he led his team to
victory with a 433 triple. At the
same time the APAchies slipped to
second place in the league as they
were unable to climb over Hilltop.
Gilmour, Demske, and Stockbauer
combined in defeating the APA-
.lncs, 4-0.

RouiOpponenis;
Basketball Ends

In the only basketball game play-
ed last Thursday. the Pierce Hall
team walked over the Beta Zeta

tivity in the Albany District Inter
