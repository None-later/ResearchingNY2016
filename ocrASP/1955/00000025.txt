Dr. Cooper, in a memorandum

for William S. Carlson, President of
dated February 24. 1955, states that

both the public and the profession are considerably confused because
an assumption is made that the two different names either give better
status or certain inferred privileges to the colleges for teachers. “This

situation is unfortunate and should

be corrected at an early date" states

Cooper. His office has recommended that one title be used for the eleven

states furthermore that the “Col-

Faculty Council Opposes Change

A resolution by the Faculty Coun-
cil of the State University College
for Teachers. Albany, dated Sep-
tember. 1954 stated:

Whereas, this institution holds a
distinctive place in the educational
program of the University in ful-
filling its exclusive mission of pre-
paring Teachers for the secondary
school system

Whereas, its present title reflects
a philosophy of education that has
permeated its history for forty years
-—it is a college for teachers. a place
where broad and specialized train-
ing in content is balanced against
a respectable but not overwhelming
program in professional education

Whereas, this faculty has nurtur-
ed and earned not only a distinction
of title but a respected place
amongst institutions training seemi-
dary school teachers

Whereas. its curriculum is design-
ed for a purpose unlike the other
teachers colleges

Whereas, more conformity of title
carries no intrinsic advantages and
would certainly do harm to the
morale of a staff" devoted to doing
a special task in a commendable
way

Therefore. BE IT RESOLVED

u s Uniformity

There has been much confusion concerning the rec-

ommendation from Herman

Cooper, Executive Dean of

Teacher Education, to change the names of all the teach-
ers‘ colleges in New York State University College of

Education.

The reasons given by Dean Cooper read as

follows: “The degrees are awarded by State University
and not by the independent units; Student recruitment is
a program of the State University and not a competitive
program sponsored by each unit; Student qualifications,
faculty qualifications, appointment procedures, curriculum
policies and procedures and all other professional matters
relating to these units are determined by the University;
each unit is either a two, three, four or five curriculum
college and each is distinctive in the area it serves.

In other words. this says

that all eleven teachers' col-

leges are the same. perform the same functions, grant the

same degrees and privileges,

accept the same. students,

have an equally-well~qualified faculty and carry the same

ratings.

This is not true.
teachcrs' college in New York

NYSCT at Albany is the only

State which grants a Bache-

lor of Arts degree and a Master of Arts degree in regular

session.

We do not accept the same

eople who attend

other teachers’ colleges in New York S ate nor do we of-
fer the same curriculum. We have as high a rating ac-
ademically as any teachers’ college in the United States,
and we have been a full member of the Association of

American Universities, to which only higher institutions gran].

of the top rank are admitted.

kick off at 7 p.111. on Friday. April

have icccivcd a service that cannot
be measured in terms of money. We.

grateful these people are to have
such it dynamic group come and do
such things for their “large family.“

handsome Count Almaviva who is
deeply in love with Rosina, the
ward of the mean and suspicious old
Dr. Bartolo. In the gray light of
dawn he comes with a band of mus-
icians to serenade his beloved with
this aria. The part from “La Juive”
is where Eleuzar, a wealthy old He-
brew, and his beautiful “believed
to be daughter" Rachel are awaiting
a frightful death, condcmmned as
JeWS to the fiery cauldron. Hesitat-
ing. Eleazar again asks Rachel if she
is willing to become a Christian and
save her life. She bravely says she
would rather die with him than give
up her faith.

Miss Emmons will sing the third

and “Leise, leise" from “Die Frei-
