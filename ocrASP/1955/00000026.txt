From The Editor’s. Desk:

Uniqueness . . .

(Continued from Page 1. Column 3/

It is the only college for teachers in the
United States in that it gives students a
liberal arts education and prepares teach-
ers to teach secondary school academic sub-
jects. Our faculty is very excellent and out-
standing, unusual for a teachers’ college.
There are many distinctions between us
and all the other teachers’ colleges, and at
present they are partly indicated by the
difference in the two titles.

If and when the names are changed and
the name New York State University Col-
lege of Education becomes uniform for all
teachers’ colleges in New York State, there
will be no difference outwardly between
any of them. We will become “just an-
other teachers’ college” to the public, even
though our curriculum remains the same,
as it will. There will be no distinctions at-
tached to us. We will lose our identity en-
tirely. We will remain the same college
with a new name, but that new name will
change everything in the eyes of the public.

We students don’t wish to have the name
of our college changed. We are very proud
of the fact that we are different, and we
don’t want to be classed with the others
and lose our distinctions!

Cloak and Teabag Episode

Broken Barriers . . .

Tuesday evening in the Brubacher Game

Room a considerable number of the mem-
bers of the faculty and student body gath-
ered together to witness reports given by
the two Juniors and three Sophomores who
were exchange delegates to Buffalo recently.
In addition to listening to and discussing
the good and bad points of the school at
Buffalo, the group entered into a discussion
of Student-Faculty relations. a very timely
topic.

There was much criticism and discussion
on the part of both the faculty and stu—
dents. The feelings of both were brought
out into the open and aired freely. We could
almost feel the barriers crumbling under
the weight of the remarks. A good many
constructive suggestions were made by
members of both groups.

This is the first time that the students
and faculty have discussed this problem on
such a wide scale. It is the first step in
furthering Student-Faculty relations—real-
izing and defining the problems clearly. We
are sure that there will be other steps to
follow. after such a successful beginning.

To the Editor:

In the aftermath of the contro-
versy and misunderstanding brought
about by my action earlier in the
Week. I feel that I owe an explana-
tion of my motives and intentions
to the faculty and students of this
college. The indirect cause of the
disturbance was the proposal by the
State University to change the
names of this and the other ten
State teacher - training institutions
to “State University College of Ed-
ucation at . .  more directly,
the cause was agitation on my part.
urging a student protest.

There are also cogent reasons for
opposing a name change. especially.
I feel. for this college. They are
stated elsewhere in the NeWs in the
resolution which I presented to
Myskania Tuesday night. and which
has since been accepted also by Stu-
dent Council.

There is one other question which
I must clarify in regard to this mat-
ter. and that is the implication of
future curricular change container!
in the proposed name. I have at no
time meant to suggest that a revo-
lutionary change in curriculum was
inevitable immediately. should the
title be changed. We had thought
that the wording of the notices was
such that it would make clear the
implication without infeiring that
it would mean an automatic change
in curriculum. Such. it has since
been proven. was not the case. I do
feel that there is an implication in
the title which would possibly bring

about some changes in future years.
in order to make the college con-
form to its title. Such changes
would, I feel, he regrettable in view
of the adequacy of our present pro-
gram. yet I had no desire. and no
intent, to be the harbinger of un-
warranted panic and confusion as
I have unwittingly become.

The truth is that those of us who
\vere deeply concerned about this
felt that some point was needed
which would bring the entire ques-
tion to the attention of the student
body. It is now our rueful conclusion
that. although student attention has
most certainly focused on this mat-
ter. we did not adopt the proper
means of presentation. and have
succeeded only in creating misun-
derstanding where we intended en-
lightenment. For this confusion we.
and especially I. apologize sincerely.

Concerning the issue of anony:
mily. I can say only that we were
regrettably at fault. We had not
meant to hide behind a cloak of
unsigned notices any more than we
meant to spread misinformation.
Simply because we had no official
title. and because it honestly had
not occurred to us that we were be-
ing unethical. the notices were not
signed, I want to emphasize that
our intentions were anything but
malicious. and that the frighten—
ingly overwhelming reaction to our
agitation has resulted in embarrass-
ment and regret on our part.

Sincerely.
Nancy Evans '55

AD Plays, One Scenery, Music
Good, One Bad Dubs Revue Hit

By JOHN LAING

Highlighting the March 15 presen-
tation of readings by the Classes in
Interpretation. under the direction
of Miss Futterer. was the Euripides
Electra. In addition to the smoothly—
cut production of the Greek tragedy.
individual readings were given by
four members of the class in Inter-
pretation of Literature. Patricia Kip
showed a need for more freedom
of expression in her readings—a
less rapid. more exaggerated differ-
entiation in characterization would
have helped. Donald Howard show-
ed poise in his reading of Marshall's
The American Dream—his fine con-
versational tone, well-placed. simple
gestures gave a direct quality which
enhanced his reading. Helen Moty-
ka showed that a marriage can ex-
ist between poetry and dramatic in-
terpretation—her.creation of a def-
inite character and mood in Brown-
ing's Porphyria’s Lover was in the
best acting tradition. yet it did not
destroy the poetry. Freer gesture
and more variety in facial expres-
sion would have improved her per-
formance. Linda Niles wisely chose
a selection which was perfectly
adapted to her abilities. Millay‘s
Childhood Is the Kingdom Where
Nobody Dies called for a sincerity
of feeling and a differentiation of
mood—a childish. wide-eyed inno-
ccnse and an adult view of life.
Miss Niles accomplished this.

The Electra was beautifully staged
in its complete simplicity. The
Draper stage has never before
shown such possibilities as in this
perforimince. Jenn Morris us Elec—
tra was excellent. Her physical be-
ing showed the complex emotions
of her charactcrization in every
way. Gestures. facial expressions.
voice—all were in the Greek tradi-
tion. and together they created an
outstanding perf'ornuincc. Nancy
Lighthull. J. Ruben Garcia. and
Jack Jacobus gave fine support. The
chorus was especially effective and
Nancy Evuns' prologue was well-
donc in creation of mood.

Last Tuesday. the first presenta-
tion of Advanced Drainuiics Labor-
atory plays was given in Draper 349.
The plays were Lorca‘s Blood Wed-
ding. directed by Mnrie Devinc. and
some well—chosen scenes from
O'Ncill‘s Desire Under the Elms. di-
rected by Marilyn Dinar-do.

Miss Devinc‘s play was unfortu—
nately poor. The cast seemed to be
(lying a painfully slow death. with
almost no exceptions. No definite
mood was established. and this is
of the greatest importance in any
production. The monotony of poor
performances was broken only by
the brief appearance of Vera Frcund
as Death. She had a definite char-
acter; she was her role physically.
vocally. and facinlly. and most im-
portuni. she knew whcrc she W215

Little needs to be said about the
production, “Happytown. U.S.A.".
of last Saturday night. The show
spoke for itself and the cast re-
sponded across the foots to the au-
dience's glowing approval. In short.
it was a tremendous success.

The impetus for any production
is the director. and. surely. the All-
College Revue was fortunate in
having J, Ruben Garcia in charge.
His skill and experience are bal-
anced by natural leadership ability.
He was the unifying firce respon-
sible for welding together the tal-
ents of so many who otherwise
might have tried to stage separate
performances. The continuity of
Joyce Shelton‘s and Jim Lockhart’s
script also supported unity rather
than allowing a string of acts as we
have been accustomed to in the
past.

If I had to attribute the success
of the Revue to one factor. it would
be that here. truly. was an ALL-
(IOLLEGE revue. Each of the four
classes and 1954 was well repre-
sented. both on and off stage. It
was a pleasure to see some of our
dramatics majors let go completely.
and more than satisfying to recog-
nize math and language students
bucking them up as committee
workers. Mr. Karl Peterson's char-
acterization of the minister made
him a necessary and integral mem-
ber of the cast. rather than a guest
conductor not connected with the
rest of the show. This is proof of
what good faculty-student relations
can be.

The set committee is to be especi-
ally congratulated for originality
and execution, Special lighting ef-
fects for the ballet and for the
sprites raised the production above
the amateur level. The general
lighting. however. was uncvcn in
spots and the changes seemed too
obvious and jerky.

The music. throughout. whether
band. piano. or record, was handled
so that it was in itself enjoyable
and made in strong support for the
act built around it.

Wonk spots there were. but they
did not hold the production from be-
ing good; they kept it from being
perfect. Bubbles“ part was sugges-
tive of the vamp but lacked thor—
ough chui‘uctcrization. I sensed the
warmth of Aim Logan. but missed
the spark and vitality she might
have had.

The size and enthusiasm of the
audience illustrated the interest of
the student body. The production
sets A high precedent for future re-
views to aspire to.

SC Forms Insurance Investigating

'Requiescanf In Pace'

. To all those who inhabit the
domiciles adjacent to Dorm
Field. it was a chilling shock to
gaze out the windows Sunday
morn and view the three granite
sentinels tottering at attention
in the bog near Pierce Hall.

Some enterprising night-
._ hawks had snatched up three
antiquated gravestones of mid-
eighteenth century vintage, and
had proceeded to plant them on
our sacred Quad for presenta-
tion on the Sabbath.

Church go-ers gasped, late
sleepers went back to their sacks
to see if they were having a

nightmare. crusaders trekked
over wet earth to view the odd-
ity.

The question is: Who done
did it? Pledgees from other
colleges on pledge missions or
ghoulish Albanian thieves!

Now the job is to find out
from what resting-abode the
ancient stone slabs came from.

This is indeed a grave prob-
lem!
