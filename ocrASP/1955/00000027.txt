By RONALD LACKEY

The first item to mention regard-
ing the Exchange Open Forum Tues-
day evening in the Brubacher Game
Room was the large turnout of fac-
ulty members and administration.
The agenda of the Forum included
reports from the five State students
who went to Buffalo on an exchange
basis recsnly. and discussion rela-
tive to the improvement of student-
faculty relations.

With at least twenty members
from the faculty. representative of
nearly every department. and the
administradon present, the program
opened at 8:10 pm, under the mod-
eration of Theresa Barber '56. Chair-
man of the exchange delegation.
Addressing a three-fourth filled
Game Room, despite inclement
weather and other regularly sched-
uled functions, Miss Barber ex-
plained the purpose of the assembly.
and called upon the other four ex-
change delegates to give reports on
their activity while at Buffalo.

Jean Hageny '56. reporting under
the caption of “Odds and Ends,"
brought out the fact that at Buf-
falo health and medical services
are provided even to the dormi-
tories through regular visits of the
health staff. whereas here at State.
we only have it so stated in the cat.—
alogue: pages 26. 27: “The college
physicians make daily visits to each
official college residence hall. In
this way, provision is made for
medical service to those students
housed in college residence halls
who are confined to bed by illness."

With respect to "Academic Work."
Sheila Lister '57 stood corrected on
:i statement that the faculty-student
ratio at BSTC is about 17:1. where-
as here it is about 11:1. President
Collins stated that the ratio is prac-
tically the same here.

Frank McEvoy‘s summary as pre-
sented was in substance i.lll' same
as recorded in last week's paper.
Following McEvoy‘s discussion of
"Sports." Michael Maxian '57. re-
ported on the "Union. Residence
Halls, and Food." He stated that,
for the most part. meetings are

 

conducted in the school itself at
Buffalo. rather than at their Union.
It is also interesting to note, as
then stated. that their cafeteria
serves the purpose of our Com-
mons. and that the campus school
children do not enjoy the privi-
leges of the college lunchroom, as
they do here. The ratio of boys to
girls at BSTC is 6:1.

Subsequent to the report topics,
there was a discussion of means to
better student-faculty relations at
State. The purpose of the Student-
Fnculty Committee, operating out
of Student Council. was identified
and explained.

Among the suggestions brought
forth were: the possibility of both
students and facility eating togeth-
er. the connection of faculty advis-
ors with all boards and commissions
operating under the budget. invita-
tion of students to faculty homes.
During the final part. of the meet-
ing. faculty members broke the bar-
rier of relative silence on their part.
and came forth with many interest-
ing. possibly constructive, and
sometimes definitely humorous rec-
cminendations.

Along the line of further con-
structive suggestions. the following
were voiced: departmental meetings
similar to the annual (7) English
Evening. faculty and administrative
attendance and observance of the
assembly period. a Get-together
Week, a facility reception, hobby
clubs. the use of an asterisk in the
Directory recommended to clear up
marriage status of both faculty and
students, a basketball game against
the facility. and the use of the
Commons and lounges by the fac-
ulty

it was definitely concluded that
small group functions should be
basic to any relationship, With the
point that faculty members did
make u good showing. thus streng-
thening the conviction that good
and well-iiitentioned will does exist.
it was suggested that. students ad-
jiilll'll to the Snack Bar with the
nearest faculty member. and the
meeting came to a. close.

of the season. APA can retain first
place by taking 2%. out of a possible
four points, as Potter will draw a
bye and is certain of’ four points.
In the event of APA and SLS split-
ting 2-2, a first place tie between
APA and Potter Would result. If SLS
would upset APA 4-0. however, Pot-
ter would emerge champion. In this
case, SLS would gain second place

and APA would slide all the way
to third place.

Eyes on SLS.

Thus the eyes of all State bowling
enthusiasts are turned on SLS. the
team which can make any rival
champion but not themselves. The
pins are down and everything else
is up to bowling greats like Joe
Duran. Tom Shumanski, Al Steph-
enson, John Zidik, Ed Rockstroh,
and their teammates. This all star
card. and the importance of this
game should certainly draw even
the most passive kegling fan. And
there are plenty of seats in Rice's
basement.

In the first game this week. the
Sayicsmen needed to make use of
their fifty pin handicap to outscore
the Club 777-735. Leo Legault equal-
led his first game score of 193 to
secure the second game for the Say-
lesmcn also. In the third game the
fraternity men again became vic-
tims of the handicap and drew the
short end despite Bernie Theobaid's
194 single.

Zidik Hits 507

SLS had little trouble beating KB
and ii 246 handicap 4-0. John Zidik
proved his consistency in the art of
knOcking over pins with a 507 triple.
Joe Purcell helped his team with u
210 single in the second game. While
drawing a bye. the relieved APA
bowlers liinbered up their arms in
preparation for next week’s "big
one"

Our Sport Spotlight this week
again falls on an IM kegler. Leo
Legauit, although nosed out by sev-
en 1.ins in individual honors. made
his kegling feats known by splitting
the maples for 193-193-145-531. By
deviating so much from his aver-
age. Leo and his Sayles teammates
dropped Potter Club from the Down-
stairs League lead and possibly
from the league championship.

Our runnerup honors this week
go to Bernie Theobald who led the.
1M kcgiers on games of 167-177-194-

Hoopstcrs Name
Sig’Smith Captain
For Next Season

Basketball still looms in the news
as it was announced that Sig Smith
had been elected captain of next
year’s cage team.

The hoopster from Romulus. New
York. broke in with the JV's his
freshman year as he dropped in 200
points. As a Sophomore Sig climbed
up to Coach Hathaway's Varsity
team and he lived up to expecta-
tions with 256 points in 20 tilts.
Scores 273

This year as a Junior. Smith out-
did his point production in both
years as he added 273 points beside
his name in 18 games.

Sig, weighing 185 pounds and
standing one inch shy of the six foot
mark. is a very deceptive ballplayer.

State hoop fans recognize his con-
sistency in hitting with one handers
and jump shots.

State fans are placing the burden
of next year's efforts on Sig's
shoulders. and Coach Hathaway is
figuring on Smith as his key man
next. year
