Some news from Santa Clara University via the

came to visit, he was always left out of the
technical conversations.

These marks which sear our minds alive?
If such there be, go mark him well.

Two weeks of vacation and plenty
of rest can do wonders to a bowling
team. This. of course, may not hold
true always. but it certainly is an
axiom which we derived from the
bowling activities of the past few
weeks. After dropping their last on-
counter of the regular bowling sea-

first place of the Downsiaii's Lcli-

Potter Club H00psiers Capture

Championship For Two Straight

By ARNIE NEWMAN

Poltcr Club, flooring a powerful.
wcll balanced squad, swept to the
Intramural Basketball Champion-
ship of the school for the second
straight year by soundly beating its
sccoud string EEP team. 65 to 47.
The high scorers for Potter in this
'imllc were Dave Stark and Tito
Guglielmone with 17 apiece. EEP's
chief point producer was Tom
O'Loughlin with 14.

Prior to this contest Potter had
trounced the Ponics. 70-45. to elim-
iliatc them from the playoffs. In
this game Stark hit for 19 to pace
the winners.
l’ottcr Best

Potter had. without a doubt. the
olflslluiding liltl'llllltll‘lil basketball
club this year. They won the cham~
pionship rather handin after colli-
pleting the regular season undefeat-
cd. In fact they were rarely pressed
very hard in any of their games. It
seems to iis that the best team won.

The season on the whole was 21

rather unsuccessful one. The three
leagues containing 20 teams were. of
necessity, somewhat unwieldly. Af-
ter the first round of play, the pro-
posed second round degenerated in—
to a playoff series diie to lack of
time. A large percentage of games
was cancelled as everything from
concerts to baseball chilies disrupt-
ed the planned schedule.

Lack of Refs

There was a rather serious prob-
lem with referees. There weren’t
any! (At least at many of the
games.) Oftentimes a pickup ref-
eree officiated in the absence of the
official who was supposed to be
provided by one of the teams. The
policy of penalizing squads who
didn't supply referees wasn't on-
forced. Pcrhaps this last problem
will be solved in future years if
AMIA succeeds iii forming a board
of paid student referees.

League Managers Jim Estramontc
and Bernie Baker were faced with :1
number of knotty problems. and did
as good 21 job as possible.

By BOB ASHFIELD

With the April 29 baseball opener
for Albany State just a week away,
Coach Hathaway and Coach Garcia
are fast whipping the candidates
into playing form.

The veterans who are striving to
hold down their berths in lieu of
the upstart freshmen are: catchers,
Bob Dreher and Sig Smith; in-
fieldei's, Bob Sage and A1 Leder»
man; outfielder, Wayne Overton;
and pitchers. John Zidik, Joe Mc-
Dowell, and Tom Shumanski.

Harvey Clear-water, a returning
veteran. who played three seasons for
State prior to 1950, is out to re-
gain his turn on the mound. Clear-
water played both football and base-
ball while in the line of duty for
Uncle Sam.

Men who look like great prospects
for the coming season include: Bob
Granados, a. veteran and transfer
from LIU. Granados. who really
knows how to handle the mitt be-
hind the piate, looks equally as
good at third where he may get the
nod when the season opens. Sandy
Bernstein. a portside swinger, has
been showing off a lot of power and
looks like a good bet for an outfield
post. Gerry McDonald. who starred
on the court, is giving baseball 9.
first try at State and may move
into the shortstop position. Luke
Sanders has looked good around sec—
ond base with his glove work and
could become a permanent fixture.
Howard Caldwell, a pitcher, has
been impressive in the early work-
outs and possesses a good fast ball
and curve. Caldwell is rated as a
pretty good infielder. too.

Team Appoints
Diamond Captain:

John Zidik and Bob Sage. both
three-year veterans of State base-
ball. were named co-captains for
this year's diamond campaign.

Sage. starting his fourth year at
shortstop, moved into the position
in his freshman year. Bob appeared
at but more than any other State
player last season, and was struck
out only once. Falconer. in the west-
ern part of the State. is his borne
town.

Zidik Best llurler

John Zidik. who also broke into
the line-up in his freshman year,
was State's top pitcher last year.

Possessing a good fast ball and
curve. John led the pitchers in
strikeouts. running up a string of
even straight in one appearance
lust season. The Yonkers” product
is what is termed "a good hitting
pitcher." Last season he also saw
action in left field when not taking
his turn on the Inound.
