Committee Meets
Current Problems

Catherine Newbold, Assistant Pro-
fessor of Social Studies, represents
Faculty Council and Frank Carrino,
Assistant Professor of Modern Lan-
guages, and L. Walter Schultze, As-
sistant Professor of Science, are
representatives from the whole fac-
ulty on the Committee.

Since this committee represents
diverse groups it is in no way a
policy making group 'but rather an
explanatory and advisory board set
up to aid the represented groups.

Some typical items considered
have been the formulation and cir-
culation of a. joint-statement on
chaperones, the collection of a list
of faculty members who are willing
to chaperone student events, review
of and recommendations to the so-
cial calendar committee, recommen-
dation of the student leadership
conference held last spring, consid-
eration of the space problem at
freshman camps and recommenda-
tion for 1955-56 seasons, considera-
tion of the dormitory and general
housing situation, exchange pro-
gram and faculty cooperation in
student activities.

“This coming college year is one

a year in which the leaders of

will necessitate change? The grout-
