Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde . . .

Wednesday evening at the special Assembly a peti-
tion was brought before the Association requesting the
reversal of the Myskania decision which allows people with
Assembly seats to vote either in Assembly or absentee. The
petition was defeated because of a lack of ten votes.

Present at the Assembly were one hundred and one
persons out of seventeen hundred persons in this college.
Out of this extremely sparse gathering, fifty-seven voted
for the reversal of the ruling and fifty four against it. A yes
vote by two-thirds of the Assembly was needed to reject
the decision—ten more votes would have done it! Even in
this small gathering it was evident the majority of the
students were opposed to it. In a larger meeting the mo-
tion for the reversal would have been carried.

In effecting this decision, Myskania went against the
constitution by reading more into it than was there. Their
job is to interpret the constitution as it is set down, not
add to it at their will!

With this decision also, Assemblies will lose their
meaning. Their whole purpose—that of legislation and

voting, will be taken away and they will eventually be dis- ‘

continued! With our present form of government, this
would be disastrous.

Originally Myskania was set up as an honorary body,
to which were elected members of the Association who
were active in the organizations on campus and who
had shown interest in and had done something for
the school. Gradually, this was changed and as the
school grew, Myskania broadened its scope and became,
in name, a judiciary body as well. At the present time the
constitution refers to Myskania as “An honorary society
of Seniors, selected for the special abilities necessary for
the execution of judicial duties and for the honor attached
to this office.” In voting for Myskania each year, the Stu-
dent Association has not taken into consideration whether
or not the candidates are qualified to fulfill this require-
ment. Certainly this recent action shows a lack of knowl-
edge of the constitution and a definite disregard of ac-
tion that should have been taken long ago.

A majority of the members of Myskania are not nec-
essarily qualified to act in both capacities—honorary and
judiciary. They have not had the experience, nor the abil-
ity, to rule on the constitution and other very important
matters that arise which require wise judgment. Myskania
cannot act as both honorary and judicial body—they are
simply not qualified.

We feel that the body should be either brought back
to its original purpose—that of an honorary society—or
the members of Myskania should be elected for their abili-
ties in judicial matters, according to the constitution!

When Myskania made this ruling they maintained
that they weren’t establishing a precedent, that they would
leave strong recommendations stating that this was being
done because of unusual extenuating circumstances.

But, in effect, they are establishing a precedent! By
doing this they are inferring that Myskania has over-
whelming powers—that their word is law and no one can
contest it. The people who voted negatively Wednesday
evening were condoning this sad state of affairs. They were,
indirectly, giving Myskania full power over us—sanction—
ing all their decisions with no thought to the constitution
or to the limits of their authority.

Yesterday, while observing absentee voting, the fol-
lowing conversation was overheard: Two members of SA
were marking their ballots, one saying to another, “Who
shall I vote for? Who do you want to get elected?—I’ll
vote for them!” This is just one example of the thought-
lessness with which people cast their ballots. The ballot—
ing is supposed to be secret, but when Myskania was ap—
proached and asked to do something about it, they refused.
If voting was restricted to the Assembly, there would be
none of this irresponsibility. The people who are interested,
responsible, and who know the candidates and what they
stand for, would be the ones who cared enough to come
and vote and know what they are voting for. It is better
to have 400 wise voters than 600 foolish ones!

VOTING
either in Assembly (in Page) or absentee at the Myskie desk TODAY.

There should be no reason why everyone should not vote. In today's

elections you are not only voting for the Student Association ofﬁcers.

but also your class ofﬁcers . . . voting is your privilege. exercise it wisely.

0’ SAY CAN YOU SEE . . .

Francis Scott Key probably saw a less tattered American ﬂag than
the one in front of NYSCT. Perhaps there's a fund some place which
could be tapped for a new one.

TIME MARCHES ON . . .

Daylight Saving Time finally proved to be the straw that broke the
camel's back . . . regimented chaos seemed to ‘be the order of the day.
The ﬁrst part of this week the clocks proved undependable. but the. un-
expected bell rang with regularity.

Not to be outdone. Brubacher's timepieces assumed organized con-
fusion. the Snack Bar giving up completely.

EMPTY SPACES . . .
we've noticed the absence of roughly six volumes of the encyclo-

pedia in Bru's lower lounge. The whole is equal to the sum of its parts

. . and in this case there aren’t enough parts. It seems implausible

that they walked away. They’ve been took. we've been took. and there

you are.

DID YOU . . .
attend the rally? You were one of the elite if you did. or one of

those running for office. Campaiin promises to rejuvenate school spirit

echoed around the not overly crowded room. We wish the new ofﬁcers
good luck with their ambitious programs.

leave after your class had been discussed? . . . or did you stay for
the entire rally? Election Commission would be justified in being an-
noyed at the mass exodus which occurred after each set of introductions
and questions.

notice the absence of the pledged office-seekers from the special
“budget” assembly Wednesday night?

appreciate the artistic endeavors of the various candidates? Not
only are they politicians, but also gifted individuals with an artistic
ﬂair. . . .

consider: . . . past actions speak as loud as present words.
YELLOW JACKETS . . .

the paraphernalia for Moving-Up Day for the Juniors has arrived
at Ye Olde Studente Shoppe (Co-op to you). This quality merchandise
can be yours for the payment of a slight fee. Here's a. chance to show
your class spirit. jolly Juniors . . . We'll see you MUD.

EVERYBODY’S DOING IT . . .
EEP formal this evening . . .
SIS weekend next week.

KB likewise will take to the dance ﬂoor then.

APA not to be outdone will hold their weekend at that time.

’55 is holding the Senior Ball June 10 . . . everyone invited.
THEATRE . . .

Summer Arena Theatre . . . July 5 - August 12 . . .
Seniors. and a limited number of Juniors with permission . .
Smith, III. of Alfred U, director. Questions and applications . . .

By CLIFF DAVIS

For a change of pace I thought
I’d dispense with a ﬂicker dun-down
and touch on some other cinema
chatter. (The shows downtown are-
n't worth talking about.)

One thing I’d like to hit upon is
the big Screen. Don’t be fooled by
ClnemaScope and Vistavision. This
process doesn‘t earmark a. picture a
big money-maker. The big screen is
commonplace, now, and because it’s
commonplace the movies done up
today aren't all sensations. Critics
have proven that movie-goers are so
gullible that they overlook quality
in a show and. go only to get the
thrill of seeing scenes unfold in
gigantic proportions.

This lends to the question: Are
the technical values more impor-
tant than the aesthetic values? Sur-
veys today are proving the former
is so. Launching of jet planes from
a carrier and leviathan Indian mas-
sacre scenes are supplanting well-
spoken love scenes.

Some directors refuse to be duped.
Take Country Girl. The recurring"
down-to-earth shots had to be pho-
tographed in black-and—white to
establish the proper mood. So did
The Waterfront bit. .

Here’s the reason why: Cinema-
Scope is good only for the big inu-
sical movies. etc. You can look over
the width of the screen and still
not take in all that goes on. Country
Girl was focused mostly on four
people and their conversations .III
dramatic style. It was imperative
that a vietver‘s attention be only on
them. There could be no room for
wandering eyes.

I‘ll be talking more later about
up-and-coming Strategic Air Com-
mand and Purple Plain. They’re
done in ‘Scope . . . and done well.
They‘re spectaculars. but in .tllls
day and age of spectacular things.
why shouldn't they be? Well. more
on small-big screens later. Be see-
ing you. Be seeing movies.

To the Editor:

Mv argument with the Kanen let-
LCI‘.‘\\'l1lCl'l appeared in last weeks
News. is not whether State College
should or should not have its 'name
changed, but rather the quality oi
intelligence and professmnal de—
meanor reflected by its writer and
all students who would think and
reason as he does. The thoughts ex-
pressed in the Kama letterare shot
through and through with half
truth. mean inference. and rash
cmotionalism—-—all of which are an—
tithetical to an intelligent or pro—
fesslonal attitude. .

He should be criticized ior rea-
soning that this college will NEC—
ESSARILY be forced to abandon
its present liberal arts curriculun‘i
and become an "education major
institution as a consequence of the
proposed change in the schools
name becoming effective. There is
absolutely no evidence. or even a
responsible hint, that a change in
the school's name will be followed
by any change in the curriculum.
Kanen‘s reaction to this issue has
been with his heart rather than his
head. which would be excusable
were it not for the fact that he has
spent four years in training to avoid
just this pitfall. ‘ I '

He should be criticized for sug-
gesting that the education depart-
ment is behind the drive (for the
name change as a first step 111 mak—
ing "education majors" of Us all. As
a matter of fact, the education de-
partment stands solidly together
with the other departments lll their
unaltcrable opposition to the pro~
posed name change. I V

He should be criticized for lllS
muddled thinking as demonstrated
by his condemnation of the which-
lion department's “pragmatic theo-
ries" in one paragraph and then. in
the following paragraph, using this
same pragmatic method. which he
has just condemned. to "prove" a
point: "The folly of dropping thc
liberal arts and of making education
majors out o1 all State students is
best shown by the value placed
upon the education courses them-
sclves!” Aside from this glaring in—
consistency. Kanen could never have
been exposed to a pragnmtic theory
of education at State because this
DHUUSUIHW went out lhc window
with prohibition and was supplanted
by Dewey’s instrumentalisln, which
is the education department‘s plnl—
osopliy today.

Student Association Candidates

Following are the speeches given
by the candidates for Student As-
sociation offices in Assembly Fri-
day and at the Rally Tuesday.

Vice Presidential Candidates

David Kendig:

“I am running for the office of
Vice-President of the Student Asso-
ciation because I believe that there
is an optomistic future to our Stud-
ent Government. a belief that has
been acquired from my work in the
class, on the Better Government
Committee, weekly attendance at
Student Council. and through active
participation in the Assemmbly.

The Vice-President must have.
had financial experience. I have had
some. as Co-ordinator of the All
College Revue. this year. and hope
to gain more next year, when I will
be Treasurer of Men's Frosh Camp.

The Vice-President must be able
to recognize ideas other than his
own. Although I am a firm believer
in our present form of government.
the New Types of Government Com-
mittee was my original proposal. I
have tried to work in as many dif-
ferent organizations as it has been
humanly possible. to get a wide
scope of experience: to have a fair-
ly accurate knowledge of Robert’s
Rules of Order.

The Vice-Presidency is honor and
glory—but it is more than a smile
a reward for office, or other super-
ficial characteristics—it is hard
work and leadership. If elected. I
will promise to devote. to the office.
the mine sincerity, earnestness and
hard work that I have devoted to
any office that I have ever held. I
am proud to state that the majority
of the people that I have worked
with on any commission in the
school will testify to my record. The
school needs new dynamic leader-
ship.

I prcsent my candidacy.‘

Frank McEvoy

"Campaign speeches are usually
for the purpose of inducing the
listeners to vote for the speaker. My
interest today is in how you vote-
the basis behind your ballot-because
it seems to me that this is the time
for an office to be filled by the
most capable person.

This school can be much better.
It is changing and growing: we
musr keep up with the change.

Many State College Students are
not proud enough of their school.
Many people look down on State
College.

We suffer from apathy—the IlOIl-
academic realms are divided into
three separate phases: Administra-
lion: Faculty: Student.

H in" about football: an S. A. bus;
College Camp (which the faculty
has been working on?!

How about unifying student gov-
ernment with faculty and adminis-
tration, and making Student Coun—
cil more active. keen and represen-
tative‘r

We don't seem to be on the "in"
on what other levels of the school
are thinking. illustrated by a field
house. athletic field and cafeteria.

We can have good assemblies be-
cause of some "fire" in them.

Elections can be more than popu-
larity polls, group battles and self
glory means.

Students are afraid to speak up
for what they want. They are re-
signing themselves. Although we
seem rather powerless. we are not!
Who: we want we can have. if we
work.

’l‘.ilk to some of the hustlers who
have fried to start some project or
change something. They‘ll say they
got tired of trying and quit. They
lacked aclive support and there
aren‘t many who hustle.

Now is the time to put in men
of ideas-men who speak up and
\\'()l‘!'.. and men who represent us.

These are most important elcc—
lions! These are cleclions that can
do much for our school.

I have spoken about why these
elections are important and what
(o look for in a candidate. 1 hope
these views sounded good to you-

I have tried to represent in Stud-

I have tried to work and speak
for your ideas.

I should like to serve you and
State College."

Clyde Payne.

“Thank you Bob. Myskania, and
fellow students.

Well. here I am and there your
are and on with the speech.

I feel it unnecessary to go over
that which I have done in the past,
but I think that it is important that
we look to the future.

As a vice-presidential candidate
for SA. it is a little foolish to stand
on a firm platform. due to the
fact that we have no set party sys-
tem in the school. If elected, though.
I will try to Work closely with the
new president. I feel that this is
important. The president of Stud-
ent Association, while holding this
important office. should always feel
that he has a vice-president that he
can delegate duties to. and whom
can be a helping hand to him when
he sees fit. I would like to be that
helping hand.

One of the duties of the Vice-
President of SA is to be Vice-Presi-
dent of Student Council. In this
post he is entitled to one vote on
Council. If elected I feel that my
two years previous experience as a
member of Student Council would
help vote wisely and pointedly.

Finally. one of the important du-
ties of the Student Association
Vice-President is to be a Student
Council Representative to the Stud-
ent Board of Finance. This I feel is
an extremely important function. If
elected. I will try to see that your
money, the money of SA is budgeted
and spent wisely.

In conclusion, I have one final
thought. If elected. I do hope that
your experience with me would not
be too Payneful.“

Joseph ’I‘agg‘art

“Fellow students I am faced with
a dilemma. When I found that I was
nominated for the Vice-Presidency
of Student. Association I was quite
surprised. You see I have never won
an election at State. However, I
have tried. thru committee work
and general inquisitiveness, to work
for the school and student affairs.
I have stayed in this election be-
cause I am an idealist. I believe that
a person who is qualified for office
should be elected to office. whether
he is a “hail fellow well met" type
or a more reticent type.

However. here I am faced with a
dilemma. I have heard so many re-
sponsible. active leaders in our Stu-
dent Government say that the way
to win an election is behind a big
smile and a good deal of legend.
There is my problem. I want to win
this election, I want a chance to
work for our govermnent from a
responsible position. but I am an
idealist. I do not believe that a
smile to everybody and a myth
should win an election. Because I
believe that the most qualified, but
not necessarily the most popular
candidate should win. I will not
sacrifice my ideals for votes.

If I don‘t know you. I won‘t
smile at you or bend your ear with
a lot of nonsense to get your vote.
I'd rather have a friend than a vote
anyday. And yet many of your lead-
ers say that to win an election all
you need is a big smile and a bigger
legend.

Here is my problem. Is the ideal-
ist who believes in capability over
personality right or is the boy
politician who smiles and says no-
thing? Only you can answer this
qucslmn for me. The way you vote
next week will tell me the answer.
Do you vote for a smile or for a
leader?

Mary

"Honored of Myskania

and members of Student Associa-
tion;
It is an honor in itself to bc

nonuuuted for the office of Student
Assmiution Secretary. I appreciate
the privilege of being able to speak
to you today.

By attending assemblies regular-
ly, I have become increasingly aware
of the valuable work done by Stud-

ent Association. I am confident
that I am capable of serving you,
the members of the college. by
working as secretary in the organi-
zation with which we shoul all be
so vitally concerned. ,

I have served as a Student’Coun-
cil Representative in my Junior
and Senior years of High School
and therefore have a working
knowledge of how a. student govern-
ment is run. I have had secretarial
experience in an office, and I have
served as secretary of our high
school Dramatics Club and as see-
retary and president of the Young
Peoples at our church. These po-
sitions gave me further experience
in such things as taking minutes
and keeping correspondence.

If elected to this office I would
sincerely try to efficiently carry
out the duties as numerous as they
may be. as secretary of your Student
Association."

Mary Crawford:

"1 thank those responsible for my
nomination and I am very interest-
ed in the position. I will be happy
to look forward to the position next
year.

I enjoy secretarial work and have
been class secretary for my Junior
and Senior years in High School
and have acted as 'secretary-pro-
tempore' on the Better Government
Committee this year which has giv-
cn me some insight into student
government secretarial work. Thank
You."

Sally llarter:

“Mr. President. Myskania. and
members of Student Association;
first I would like to thank the peo-
ple who nominated me so I could
have the privilege of standing be-
fore you today. I realize the time
and effort the job of secretary of
S. A. would take but if you elected
me. I would spend this time and
effort. I have had experience in
government and secretarial work
throughout high school. Therefore.
I think I could take on the respon-
sibilities of this office. Thank You."

Marilyn Leach:

“Members of Myskania and Stud-
ent Association. In this my fresh~
man year, I have become acquain-
ted with our Student Government
here at State College. As a fresh-
man representative to Student
Council I have observed our Student
Government and the capacities of
its executive offices, and I know the
position of Student Association Sec-
retary requires responsibility and
work. I have had secretarial ex-
perience on various high school or-
ganizations and some additional ex-
perience here at college, and for
technical ability—I am able to type.
I would work to the best of my
ability to fulfill the duties of Stud-
ent Association Secretary."

Gail Petty:

“Honored members of Myskania.
Mr. President, and Student Asso-
ciation: I am here before you today
as a candidate for SA secretary. As
you know. the duties of this office
include the taking of minutes in
assembly. attending to the corres-
pondence of the association. and
acting as secretary for Student
Council. I feel I am qualified for
the office as I have held secretarial
positions both in and out of school.
can type and take shorthand. I
realize this is an office of respon-
sibility and if I am elected, I will
do my utmost to fulfill the trust
you have placed in me."

Enid Vigilante:

"Members of the Student Asso-
ciation. First. I would like to thank
you for nominating me for the of-
fice .‘1' Secretary of Student Associa-
tion. This alone is a great honor and
I fully realize the responsibilities
of the secretary.

I feel that I am capable of this
job. I have had typing experience
in the past. and although I do not
take shorthand. I'm a very first
writer. Also. I have been involved
\vith government in high school.

I realize that government plays
an important part at State and am
fully aware of what the office en-
tails. If I am elected. you can be'
sure I will do my best to live up
to your confidence in me. I would
like you to give me not only the
opportunity of proving my capo".
blllty to you but also the honor of
serving you. I thank you." '
