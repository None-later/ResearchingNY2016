US Considers Reciprocal Trade,
Statehood Conferences With Reds A, Capnol

By A. It. STEPHENSON

President EisenhOWer's adminis-
tration scored a minor victory this
week, as the Senate Finance Com-
mittee voted to send to the Senate
floor without crippling amend-
ments. the House-approved recip-
rocal trade bill. Many special in-
terest groups had hoped to get
strings attached that would weaken
the President’s power to make trade
agreements. Instead, the commit-
tee voted a compromise that en-
ables the President to limit specific
imports if domestic industries are
threatened.

The applications for statehood by
Hawaii and Alaska took another
step forward this week, but it may
easily be the last for this session
of Congress. The House Rules Com-
mittee reported out the bill to add
the two territories to the Union,
but did it in such a way that it is
rather doubtful that the bill will
be successful. The two applications
will be considered together: and
amendments will not be allowed. As
a result, it is probable that those
who do not want Alaska and those

Judicial Society
Revises Customs

According to Joan Carlin '55,
Chairman of Myskania, the honor-
ary Judicial board has revised the
custom of the college as listed on
pages 41 and 42 of the Freshman
Handbook. The changes were made
to make the customs more work-
able and to delete those which are
obsolete and out of date and to
further tradition. Miss Carlin also
states that Myskania recommends
to the Rivalry Committee that they
not omit the Banner Hunt from
the rivalry ceremonies. They advo-
cate that the class hunt for the
banner and report to Myskania
when they find it and this will end
the hunt.

The changes in traditions in-
clude: the deletion of Numbers 3
and 4, which read:

3. When two or more students of
different rank enter a building or
any room of a building at the same
time, difference must be shown to
upperclassmen.

4.. There shall be no cutting across
the lawns of the campus at any
time. Deletion of “Fight Song" from
5 which reads:

5. Freshmen shall be required to

know "College of the Empire State," 1

"Arm in Arm," “Life Is Very Dif-
ferent." by November 1.

Number 6 will be changed from:

Freshmen shall be required to
wear beanies at all times except in
classes and residence hails from the
first day of school until Thanksgiv-
ing recess and for the entire week
preceding Moving-Up Day, to read:

Excluding Sundays except to
classes and residence hails from the
first day of school until Thanks-
giving recess and for the entire
week preceding Moving-Up Day.
In the event freshmen win rivalry

who do not want Hawaii will have
sufficient voting power to defeat
the bill.

On the international front, pros-
pects for a Big-Four conference ap-
pear a little brighter as the am-
bassadors of the U. 8., Russia, Eng-
land and France meet Monday in
Vienna to complete the details for
the long-overdue peace treaty for
Austria. If the work goes smooth-
ly, a meeting of the Foreign Min—
isters will follow, for the treaty
signing, which gives Austria her
freedom. Following those cere-
monies, the leaders will discuss the
possible agenda for a meeting of
the heads of state of the Big-Four.

In the Pacific, Admiral Radford,
the head of the Joint Chiefs-of-
Staff, and Assistant Secretary of
State Walter Robertson completed
talks with Chiang Kai-shek on the
Formosa situation. Secretary Dulles
announced that the U. S. is willing
to meet with fled China without
nationalists leaders present. This is
something of a switch on the part
of American leaders, as participa-
tion by Chiang has always been
a prerequisite for any such confer-
ence. It might be noted that this
statement could be the forerunner
for recognizing the Reds. until re-
cently, our government has not

considered direct negotiations with
the Communists.

’News' Receives First, Second Place
Ratings From Press Associations

Communiques were received this
week from the Associated Collegi-
ate Press Association and the Col-
umbia Scholastic PreSS Association
containing the rating of the State
College News, Ronald Lackey ’55,
Executive Editor, reports. The honor
rating from ACP for first semester
this year is Second Class. The CSPA
rating for second semester 1954—-
first semester 1955 is First Class.

Associated Collegiate Press is an
association of college neWSpapers
throughout the nation, whereas the
Columbia Scholastic Press Associ-
ation is composed of high school
and teacher college newspapers of
the eastern United States.

Papers published by State were
forwarded to the offices of the

others in State’s own particular
classification, and rated according
to its relative standing with refer-

This period should be utilized
more advantageously by scheduling
events that have in the past proven
to be popular.

A committee should be formed,
consisting of both student and fac-
ulty members, that would have as
its sole function the scheduling of
events that would be of interest to
all; for example, outside speakers,
debates with well known colleges,
pep rallies. Athletic Association
budget hearings, etc.

Such a plan would help to alle-
viate, to some extent, the crowded
condition of the social calendar and
wound also do away with the neces-
Sity for compulsory assemblies.

~l. The mystery of Athletic Asso—
ciation must be cleared up. Every
undergraduate in the college pays
almost half of his Student Tax to
this organization and yet. when
budget hearings are held, the at-
tendance is always sparse.

if the hearings were held in the
reserved period I mentioned pre-
students would
chance to learn whcrc their money
is gomg and could better under-
stanu the function of this board.

have u'

our college paper compared with
others across the nation this year,
in the case of ACP.

Accompanying the ratings were
booklets containing both sugges-
tions, commendations and criticisms
of the paper, indicating also on a
point-by-point basis how the paper
was rated according to set stand-
ards.

ACP rated the News superior on
its editorial page list of features,
sports display, its typography, and
its printing. CSPA commended the
paper "highly for its fine grasp of
most of tne rules of makeup, parti-
cularly in view of the fact you (the
News) have no course in Journal-
ism or advisor.” The critique pro-
Vided by the latter association clos-
ed with the comment, “In general
the News is a high level perform-
ance Journalisticaliy; it can go
higher.”

The judge also commenting on
printing stated “a real, clean
printing job! Give the printer a
scroll and a ‘well done’."

ACP Judge, G. B. Hiebert com-
ments that the news sources are
very good but lack “interpretive ar-
times on education” and that we
should “avoid giving too much
space to extra-curricular activities."
ACP ratings include Superior (All-
Americani, Excellent (First Class),
Very Good (Second Class), Good
i’inird Class), Fair (Fourth Class‘),
and Weak (Fifth Class).

CSPA ratings are awarded on a.
point system including First Place,
Second Place, Third Place and
Fourth Place. Medalist rankings are
awarded publications especially sc-
lectcd from the First Place group
for outstanding qualities; however,
no more than ten per cent of all the
cntries in the class concerned are
considered.

cause several men were sincere in
their interest and showed initiative
in driving these sports into the lime-
light. Today such sports such as
track and tennis are in their infant
stages. Will Bowling and Wrestling
become a varsity sport? Will ten~

depends. Sincere interest must be
disp‘ayed. How about you. Why not
add your name to the list. Be an

We‘d like to congratulate Joe Du-

a possibility. We only have to prove
that we want it bad enough.

Expense is the first drawback.
But, to field a four team intrammu~
ral league with fifteen players on
each team would cost approximately
$7500. Dividing that by 1500 stud-
ents, it would mean an increase of
$5.00, game uniforms could be

State "as Man Power

State has the man-power to coin-
pcte in a league with Hobart. Hum-
llton. Union. or any other schools
of comparable size. Size and speed
should be considered when judging
man—power. It appears that men
such as Don Mayer. Joe Zizzi. Joe
Anderson, Paul Sloand. Juck Peu-
cock. Harvcy Clcarwaicr. Leo Le-
gauli. and Ed Rocksieroh. to name
a few. could hold thcir own.

Well. it is an idea. Certainly it
is ionicthing to think about other
than bunner hunting or watching
other schools play on TV.

Coach Hathaway and his baseball
nine have high hopes of opening
their 1955 season today—if the rains
let up longr enough. The Feds will
play host to Oneonta State with
the action slated to get underway
in Bleecker Stadium. Tomorrow
they will travel to take on the New

Indications are that State dia-
mond fans will see a new array of
faces in the local’s opening lineup.
Bob Granados. who received the
offerings of Kansas City’s Arnold
Porrocarrero when the two played
Amcrican Legion ball will probably
get the nod at third base. The LIU
transfer plays equally well in both
slots. Gerry McDonald seems to
have overshadowed Bob Sage for
the shortstop position. Bob will
probably move over to the right
side of the keystones sack with Luke
Sanders ready to take over.
Bernstein In Left

Out in the green pastures. a
small but powerful hitting Sandy
Bernstein. has nailed down the left
field position on his great hitting
ability. Howard Caldwell, a regular
moundsman. may see duty as a first
baseman.

The remaining slots are fairly
well set with Sig Smith returning
with the caicher‘s mitt. Wayne Ov-
erton will be trotting to the center-
field spot for his third year, while
Bob Drcher will complete his fourth
year on the squad as a right field-
