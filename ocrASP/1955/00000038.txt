Because of the [urge nuirnbcr of

dence halls next your, according to

numbers will be placed on a waiting
list pchdlllg cancellations.

All women who, in filling out a
preference form for lionsing. made
it first clloicc for Brubrwher or
l’icrcc "oils are requested to come
to drnw at these times, also. A
waiting list of upperclussnren will
bc fol'llli‘d for each of these hulls,
so lhul those who do not receive low
enough numbers to put them im-
rncdlntcly in the hull of their choice
rrnry rcccive assignments as vacan-
clcs occur or new housing is acquir—
Hi. It is cstinnrtcd that 112 of the
rooms in Brubrrclrer will be reserved
