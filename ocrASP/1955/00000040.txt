There’s an old saying that all
good things must come to an end.
And so it is that we and another
year here at State. Before we do,
however. we’d like to review some of
the highlights of the sports year.

To begin the year there was soc-
cer. Under the ﬁne tutelage of
Coach Joe Garcia the booters came
through in ﬁne fashion on a 5-3-2
record. Some of the outstanding
Ped booters included the Lindberg
brothers—John and Bill— Don Can-
onica, Ralph Adams. and Tito Gu-
gliemone, all of whom were given
special honors in intercollegiate
selections.

In IM play Potter Club downed
APA to become school champions
in football.

Clubs Added

Meanwhile, two new clubs were
added to State‘s athletic program.
A Riﬂe Club was formed as was 11
Bowling Club. The bowlers came up
in ﬁne fashion in a newly organized
Albany District Intercollegiate
League. A Wrestling Club was also
quite active. and the grapplers came
up with a victorious year.

The year then moved on to bus-
ketball at which time hoop fans
became quite used to reports that
State lost by 2. 3. or 4 points. Al-
though the Feds suffered 21 losing

Jack Minon's 30 points in a single
game, and Jerry McDonald’s back

Mayer teamed up with Jack to
show the fans the frosh had talent
equal to that of any other class.
Sig Smith turned in another ﬁne
year for the cagers adding consider-
ably to his three-year totals. Of
course, there was one person no one

team in practically all offensive
totals.

SLS Wins l7-9

Four games highlighted last
week‘s action in the National Soft-
lzall League. By whipping the sec-
ond place Sayles team, 9-1, Potter
further secured first place position
in this league and as of this time
seems to be a sure bet to capture
the pennant. The likewise undefeat-
ed SLS appears to have an outside
chalice.

Wednesday night's action saw
SLS blast three consecutive homers
to down Summit. 17-9. Yeomans.
Swlerzowski and Pryor hit the
round-trippers. Don Dame also ho-
mered in the rout.

Muller Hurls One-Hitter

In racking up his third straight
\lctory, Potter hurler Hank Muller
struck out seven Saylesmen and
pitched no-hit ball for six innings.
With one out in the seventh, how-
ever. opposing pitcher Hoot Stefano
ripped a single to right ﬁeld. Short-
stop John Rookwood hammered out
two doubles in this game to lead
Potter.

Sayles Grabs Two

The Sayles nine remained within
striking distance, howover, with two
victories. Combining twelve hits. in-
cluding home runs by Stubby Gui-
bord and Ross Dailey. they scored
in each inning to roll over Sum-
mit. 23-6. The second win was back-
ed by Gerry Birr's three-hitter and
Hoot Stefano's long double, as
Sayles sent Hilltop home defeated,
5-1.

In the ﬁlial game of the week.
the oposition continued to blast
APAches' hurler Mathews. This
time Summit sent him to the show-
ers with sixtexen hits, until Bindrim
came in and retired the side with
the bases loaded. The ﬁnal score of
this “contest” was 13-7 in favor of

Summit.

A meeting for forming a track
program will be held on Tues-
day, May 17. in Draper 111 at
4 p.m.

All those interested are urged
to attend as attendance will be
used to measure the amount of
interest in the sport.

Having successfully tucked vic-
tory No. 1 under their belts, Coach
Hathaway and his baseball nine go
after their second win today as they
travel to Oneonta to face the team
]that handed them their opening 8-0
oss.
The Feds lone victory thus far
came Saturday as the locals downed
Danbury State in a Moving-Up Day
program, 4-2. The win came about
as Harvey Clearwater threw a neat
three-hitter and received timely

amt spew:

defeat.

Harry Millet, losing the Table
Tennis Championship to defending
champion Bill Rock (19-21, 22-20,
19-21, 24-22. 22-20) nevertheless put
up a terrifﬁc battle and in the es-
timation of the estimated 250 wan-
dering spectators actually outplayed
Rock. The match, four hours long,
was a greater test of endurance
and a psychological battle for Harry
as he actually led in the ﬁnal, 20-

smiling loser.
