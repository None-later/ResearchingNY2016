Financial Program

The representatives from the Edu-
cation 20 and 21 sections of the 1954-

Ci iniiiittee.

The committee has adopted the
following procedure for the disburse-
ment of the finances:

in) The Education books will be
sold to this year‘s classes for ap-
proximately onc-hali of last year's
cost. This has been estimated as
their present value.

lb! The money obtained, together
with any surplus from last year’s
Education fees, will be distributed
to all students. proportionately as
soon as it is possible after the money
is collected mprobably in the begin-
ning of the second semester.

ici One week will be set aside
when the students will be able to
obtain this money. After the week
is over, iill money remaining will be
turned over to the Education Dc-
partinciit for use in any way that
they see fit, preferably for the es—
tablishiiicni of some sort of research
fund.

id) A committee has been found-
iaicd consisting of Kcndig, Chair-
man, Michael Maxluii, John Rook-
wood, June Frankiand, Theodore
Peterson and Annabelle Persico,
Juniors. This committee will under-
take the resixmsibility of adminis-
