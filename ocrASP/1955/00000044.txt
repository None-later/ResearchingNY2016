We noticed a young looking guy
at frosh camp and We couldn't fig-
ure out whether he was an older
frosh or a transfer student. The
good looking individual struck us
as a nice easy-going guy. It came as
quite a pleasant surprise to us when
Richard Sauers was introduced at
dinner as the new addition to the
Physical Education department and
coach of State's basketball and base-
ball teams. Later as we approached
the navy vet for an interview and
from our talks with a few of the
varsity athletes he'll coach, we
found out our judgments of Coach
Sauers were all true. The young
Slippery Rock Graduate (Class of
'51) and Penn State Graduate
(Class of ’55) is the kind of guy you
can approach to talk to. feeling at
ease and knowing that if you ever
have troubles with the game you
can sit down and talk it over with
him. To quote a varsity eager, “he's
a young guy with good ideas." From
all of us concerned with sports
around State. Coach, it's a hearty
welcome—and we wish you and the
"Sauersmen" all the luck in the
world.

Soccer Begins

At present all the State sports
enthusiasts are ready to witness the
opening soccer game of the year. It
certainly must have been a long
rough summer on Coach Joe Gar-
cia as he waited to see what sort
of team he could salvage from last
year’s powerful team which was torn
apart by three "S's"—senior. service
and studies. As it turned out the
score read 3-2-3 respectively. The
picture seems to be getting a little
brighter daily however as last year's
vets and a flock of upperclassmen
have begun getting the kinks out
of their arms and legs after a long
summer lay-off.

At this point we’d like to urge all

 

who have any interest at all to
get out there and place your name
on Garcia's growing list of candi-
dates. Even if you've had no high
school experience it's no reason to
sit on the sidelines if there is any
potential in you. In digging through
old scoop sheets of the soccer squad
we’ve noticed many top notch boot-
ers actually got their start at the
game at Beverwyck under Garcia's
tutelage. There’s only one way to
show the Coach and yourself wheth-
er it’s in you or not and that's to
get out there and find out.

Garcia also has an appeal out
for men to become managers and
publicity men for the squad. The
importance of publicity men should
not be under-estimated as no team
can gain a following without men
to spread the word of their feats.
For managers there's also a big
prize in store for your efforts as
they are eligible for the COVeted var-
sity “S” letter.

Little Mascot

In case some of you soccer fol-
lowers are wondering who the dark
complexioned little kid with the
brown shorts and white T-shirt is
stoppingthose soccer balls at the
post. he’s none other than Ken
F‘lories whose back for another sea~
son with the hooters. At the rate
Ken's going now he's going to be
quite an asset to any team he may
play for. Watch for him before and
during time cuts at State’s opener.
You'll see what we mean.

Varsity Status?

For all you bowlers and wrestlers
and all others—look for the kegling
and grappling games to become
State’s fourth and fifth varsity
status sports this year. You track-
men also will be pleasantly surpris-
ed to hear track will be run on a
club basis this year and may hit
varsity status next season.

Thirty Upperclassmen Turn Out
For Start Oi S

occer Campaign

Eight Missing
From Garcia's
Previous Team

With eight big booters missing
from last year’s powerful soccer
squad, Coach Joe Garcia stopped
scratching his head early this week
and began putting a group of ap-
proximately thirty upper class can-
didates through daily workouts. A
few new frosh reported but Garcia
expects to see more after the regis-
tration and freshman tests are over.

Lindbergs Out

Heading the list of those familiar
faces State fans will not be seeing
this year are John and Bill Lind-
berg—the All-American Soccer
brothers. Bill donned the graduation
cap and gown last June while John
was lost for academic reasons. In
John's case—State‘s loss is Rome's
gain as the younger Lindvberg will
be kicking them for the western
school this season. Last year's other
graduates included Don Canonica
and Ralph Adams——a couple of top-
notch hooters. In the case of an-
other pair — Phil Billings and Al
Rocklien—it was a case of Uncle
Sam intervening while the loss of
Bob Liermoe and John Pengelly was
due to academic reasons.

Bonestcel Captain

Heading the list of those avail-
able for much soccer action this
year are Captain Bill Bonesteel and
All-State Honorable Mention Tito
Guglielmone. Several others who
drew starting positions at one time
or another throughout the season
are Al Lederman. Ev Weiermiller.
“Rebel” Hockmuth. Hollis Tibitts
and Ed Jones. Jones is the booter
who showed very much promise as
a Sophomore and returns to Suite
lifter leaving a semester.

Scott Transfers

Another man of experience that
the Garciamcn will have is Gone
Scott. a transfer from Hamilton.

Others out to help attempt to
duplicate or better last year’s fine
5—3—2 record are Fran Nancctti, Bill
Maison. Bill Gropp, Eric Kippert.
Paul Daminer. Wendell Borden,
Wurrcii Duiiluiin. Wuync Harvey,
