‘ STATE COLLEGE

Addition To Richardson Hall Rapidly Progressing;

To Provide Rooms

Construction on the addition to :
Richardson Hall will possibly be 

completed by Spring Vacation.

New facilities for the Dramatics
Department will include stagecraft
rooms on the ﬁrst ﬂoor, a large re-
hearsal room with a stage approxi-
mately the size of Page Hall stage,

dressing rooms, and costume and ,

make-up rooms on the second ﬂoor.
A stairway will connect these dress-
ing and make-up rooms to back-
stage of Page Hall.

Radio sound studios and a con-
trol room on the second ﬂoor will
be used to correct speech and to
provide practical experience for ra-
dio and television activities.

In addition to new facilities for
the use in the dramatic and audio-
visual ﬁelds, four ofﬁces will be in-
cluded on the ﬁrst ﬂoor: two class-
rooms and seven ofﬁces will be in-
cluded on the second ﬂoor. One-way
glass will be used for two walls of
the middle of three adjoining sec-
ond ﬂoor ofﬁces making it possible
for this office to be used as an ob—
sewation room.

A large music rehearsal room, mu-
sic library, two practice rooms and
storage rooms for instruments (all
on the third floor) will expand the
existing Music Department. One ad-
ditional classroom and ﬁve ofﬁces
will also be included on the third
floor. A corridor through the ex-
isting classrooms in Richardson will
connect these rooms with the third
ﬂoor of Richardson.

The basement of the new ediﬁce
will be used primarily to house a
new heating plant.

The new building will connect
Draper Annex to Page Hall. pre-
senting a completed front on Wash-
ington Avenue of the College's
buildings.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. SEPTEMBER 30. 1955

 

Sam 5M

We were very enthused this week
by the wonderful and fast start
that many sports groups on campus
have gotten off to. It seems as
though it was only yesterday that
most of these groups went through
the year haphazardly and making
a farce of the "purpose" clause in
their constitution. This year. due
perhaps to new leadership and new
blood or possibly just to a renewed
interest, there is evidence of a po-
tentially outstanding year if each
individual takes it upon himself to
attend the meetings and do his ut-
most to help his particular club or
organization. Typical of these
changes. we believe, are AMIA and
Varsity Club.

It’s still clear in our minds how,
in our freshman year. we were very
disgusted at the IM set up. The
sports were there all right. but. no
one seemed to know who ran what
and games usually ended up in mi-
merous flareups because of poor
league organization. With it new and
better set up this year. all the
school‘s IM athletes can look for-

AMIA Heads
Slate Beginning
Oi Fall Sports

Intramural football was the big
topic of conversation as the Asso-
ciation of Men‘s Intramural Ath-
letics held their first meeting of the
your Tuesday night. Ray Castillo.
Football Commissioner, has an—
riounccd that ii sign-up sheet has
been posted on the AMIA bulletin
board. All captains are urged to
sign up their teams on the lower
Draper board. “The main objec-
tive." states Castillo. "is for the
freshmen to get busy on organizing
teams for the league." A captain‘s
meeting will be held in the. very
near future. At this time league
rules and schedules will be drawn
up so that the loop may begin oper-
utloii as Soon as possible.

'l‘riick Discussed

The other major topic of discus-
sion was the Truck and Field events,
scheduled for l-lomcconiing Week-
end. November At. A sign-up sheet.
has been placed on the AMIA bul-
letin board and it. is ilic hope of
Coach l-int.haway. Jim Sivcci. «Prcxy
of AMIAi and Joe Barton tliircc-
tor of Track) thiil lhis new sport
will bring out a large number of
onthiisiiists. II. is hoped the coni~
petition will draw uniiny witnesses.

’l‘cnnis to Start

Another sport. duc to get under
way soon is the tennis toin'mimciit.

ward to better leagues and perhaps
because of it. keener and better
competition.

Organize Teams

At this point we’d like to urge all
groups on campus to organize their
own grid teams. As of Wednesday
there were but six. Where are all
the group houscs’ teams?

Besides grid there are numerous
other fall sports going on, as can
be seen by the IM story on this page.
Although the competition may get
rough at times it never will reach
the calibre that any group, fresh
or otherwise. must consider their
attempts at the game futile. Sign
up today on the AMlA bulletin
board in lower Draper.

Likewise. what about you track
men? Homecoming weekend will
mark the inauguration of track at
State. Thanks to the persistent work
of Joe Barton and Co. enough inter-
est ls being shown to merit the var-
sity status that the Phys. Ed. De-
partment is thinking of placing it
in.

There's still more room for your
signature for the track and field
day which will include hurdles.
dashes, shot put, high jump. relays.
etc.

While we're in the mood of urg-
ing. may we also suggest you keg-
ling enthusiasts give it a whirl this
weekend and try to place your name
on State's Intercollegiate. Bowling
TCutlll.

Grid Game Today

A note to you grid fans is that a
new type. of "flank" football will be

State’s Boaters
Sport Brilliant
School Records

By BOB KAMPF

In trying to familiarize State
soccer fans with the Fed booters. we
dug up a little background from
some of the nucleus of this year‘s
team. Coach Garcia is fortunate in
having six veterans of last year's
team back to help better the 5-3-2
record of last year.

’l‘ito to Guard Goal

All-State Honorable Mention
goalie, Tito Guglielmone, will be
back stopping opposition scoring
this year. Tito hails from Center
Moriehes. Long Island. and gradu-
ated from Center Moriches High
School. At Center Moriehes. Tito
was a four letterman in varsity
sports. He experienced a taste of
baseball. basketball, track and soc-
cer. This is his third year of soccer
for State. and he's out to hold down
the score of State's opponents once
more.

lionosteol to Captain Team

Returning for his third year also,
is Captain Bill Bonesteel. Bill re-
ceived his first experience in soccer
at Cairo Central High School in
Cairo, N. Y. Not only was he a
soccer player. but also a baseball
and basketball letterinan. Bill is '
Junior, and has high hopes for a
good season on the soccer field.

Another Junior who will be draw—
ing a starting position on this year‘s
squad is Al Lederman from Colonic.
N. Y. Al attended Roessleville High
and starred in baseball, football.
truck and basketball. Besides play-
ing soccer for State. Al also uses
his talents on the baseball diamond.
Hamilton Transfer

Booting for Albany this year iii-
slciid of Hamilton College. will be
icnc Scott. Gene transferred from
Hamilton this year. and will be
fourth starting Junior for the Gal'-
cliinicn. Last year. Gene played for
Hamilton and thus brings his ex-
perience hero to State. He hails
from East. Greenbush, N. Y.. but he
attended Reinsen High School in
itcmscn, N. Y. At Rcinsen. he par—
ticipatcd in baseball, basketball and
MH‘UT‘I'.
.Ioiics ltctnrns

Ed Jones. who left State for Al
.s'i‘llli‘HlA‘l', returns to bolster the
(ini'ciiinicn this year. Ed returns as
ll Sophomore. He is another Long
Island boy. from Valley Stream. At.
Valley Sti'ciiini High School, he was
a five lcltornnin, but. soccer was not
on his list. of letters. Football. buse-
biiil, biiskctbuli, cross country and
truck comprised his letters.

A Vol that. Garcia is relying on
for much action is Manfred “itcbcl”
llockmntli. the small graduate of
Wupphigcrs Central School in Wiip-
plngcrs Filllﬁ who was sccn riiiiiilng
for the track team as Well as lli‘-

ments at all home athletic events.

Varsity “S” Club with Rookwood
at the helm is made up of all varsity
letter winners. Besides promoting
intercollegiate athletics, the service

Albany. N. Y.

 

Ti bets, and first year men Carl
Maxson, Paul Sloand and Gene
Scott expect to see action in the
backfield.

Three team veterans. Bob Backer,
Bob Davidson. and Ed Jones are all
expecting to trod Fordham soil. All-
State goalie, Tito Guglielmone will
be guarding the nets.

The team enters the game in ex-
cellent physical shape and appears
to have a strong offensive threat.
In the defensive department, how-
ever. the team is lacking, via grad-
uation and other scholastic reasons.
During the past few weeks concen-
trated effort has been placed on
scrimmaglng and less training.

The scrimmage against Williams
scheduled for last Saturday was
called off because of rain. In last
year's tilt against the Fordham
team, state was victorious by a 7 to
2 margin. The citymen are expect-
ed to field a strong team this year
in that almost their entire team
from last year has returned.

Face ItI’I

After this week's tilt the Feds
will face their neighboring foe, RPI.
who last week bOWed to Cortland
State by a score of 3 to 2. The tilt
will be held at the engineers' field.

Coach Garcia has high hopes as
this year's season is launched but
he is a little apprehensive about the
fact that the team lacks experience.
“The team is in excellent shape."
states the coach. "and if we lose it
won't be because the boys aren't
trying or because they are lacking
experience."

Games At lieverwyck

All home games are held on Bev-
erwyck field which is located across
from Brubacher Hall.

A probable line-up is as fOIIOWS:
