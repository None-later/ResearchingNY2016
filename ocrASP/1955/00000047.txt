Tryoui's For
Three AD Plays

Tryouts will be held for the first
advanced dramatic plays this after-

ber 18.

The three plays are “Gioconda”

rected by Carol Allen; “Cyrano de
Bergerac" by Rostand, under the
direction of Marjorie Jelly, and
“Theodore Muller," an original play
to be directed by Richard Feldman,

purpose of these plays is to give
a realistic environment in which
students in Advanced Dramatics
can place the fruits of their direc-
tional experience before the school
as a whole. AD lab plays are labor-
atory in every sense of the word,
that is to say, the emphasis is on
the experimental."

Missing Link Returns

“Come on over to the cave
sometime" — might have been
said many years ago B.C. (Be-
fore College) but someone said
it the other day.

A few once healthy rah rah
cullegiates have turned cave men
for each a. better, handy estab—
lishment. There old bar rugs are
flea ridden and prehistoric art
designs the three and one eighth
walls around the abode.

The Neanderthal man thought
he had it bad but at least he
could go out and drag home a
bonnie lassie by the pony tail.

Could it be that times are so
tough they'll send us all back
to the Indians?

together and become acquainted.
This Rivalry provides for the exer-
cise of many talents and also on-
ables our future leaders to blossom
forth. It is a means whereby the
various integral parts at State be-
come :1 composite whole.

If you are experiencing any
doubts of your hidden talents, you
have a large choice upon which to
dispcll these indecisions. You can
choose from sports, dramatics, mu-
sic, stagecraft or debate. Rivalry
features such events as a softball
game. both men‘s and women's. :1
Soph-frosh debate, a sing, a soccer
game, track and field games. checr-
