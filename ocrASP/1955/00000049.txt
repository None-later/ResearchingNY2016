Men To Handle
Sports Publicity

To the Sports Editor:

The Athletic Public Relations
Board amid feverish activity due to
the full slate of State sports endeav-
ors, today issues an urgent call for
added student support and partici-
pation.

Handles Publicity

The board, probably State Col-

lege's most worthwhile organization,

After a long two week wait State
fans will finally be able to see Joe
Garcia's ‘55 soccer team in action
tomorrow. The Pcds again this year
have been put through some rugged
workouts and again Garcia has
come up with a potentially strong
team,

There's no question that these
hooters need strong school support
to bring out the best in them. You

AMIA Brings

 

have probably heard this statement
an infinite number of times be-
fore, but we’d like to go one beyond
infinity and say it again—“Be out
there tomorrow at Bleecker to root
the Peds on."

Game At Bleecker

It may come as a surprise to you ‘

also to learn that tomorrow’s game
will be held at Bleecker Stadium.
Why Bleecker? We say—Why now
Bleecker? After hearing the pros
and cons of Bleecker and Bever-

wyck—we‘re convinced Bleecker has ‘

it all over Beverwyck. In the first

    

By ZACK CLEMENTS
Tomorrow the State soccer team faces a tough Hillyer

College “11.” The game will be held at Bleecker Stadium
instead of Beverwyck Field because of the better condition
of the former. The tilt is slated to begin at 2 pm. (The
RPI game was being played as the paper went to press
so a report on that game was unavailable.)

In a thriller at Fordham last Sat-
urday the Garciamen were held to
a 3-3 tie by the New York “11.” The
game, which lasted through two
overtimes, a total of 98 playing min-
utes, was a heartbreaker for the
State team. After getting the ball
on the kick-off the statesmen held
the ball in Fordham territory for
practically the entire first period,
