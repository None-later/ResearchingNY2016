Pres. Eisenhower’s Illness Continues;
Political Parties Sharpen Fangs

By DOMINIC DeCECCO

In The Nation . . .

Big news this week is President
Eisenhower’s recent illness and the
political implications that it in-
volves. The Republican party will
be forced to assume that Eisenhower
will not run in the 1956 election un-
til they receive official news from
Eisenhower. Republican Presiden-
tial aspirants are already trying on
the still-warm shoes of the President.
Among them are Vice-President
Richard Nixon, Chief Justice Earl
Warren, ex-Governor Thomas E.
Dewey, and Presidential Assistant
Harold Stassen.

Democratic hopefuls however, are
not to be left out. They include
Averill Harriman, Adlai Stevenson
and Estes Kefauver. With Ike tem-
porarily out of the running the
Democratic guns are beginning to
boom and without Ike the Republi-
can party seems to be floundering.

Averill Harriman, popular Gover-
nor of New York, has the backing
of Carmine DeSapio and seems well
on the road toward gaining votes at
the Democratic convention.
State-wise . . .

New York State Chairman Mi-
chael H. Prendergast has announced

Dean’s List . . .

that Democratic office holders re-
frain from entering into appoint-
ment deals with the Republicans. In
this Republican - gerrymandered
state it has been the practice of
the Democrats to get offices filled
by Democrats by promising certain
favors to the Republicans. We do
not claim to condone this practice,
but without it there would be very
few vacancies in this state filled by
Democrats. Perhaps if the Republi-
cans were to re-district the state
more democratically there would be
less of this practice.

At State . . .

Malcolm A. Rogers, Public Rela-
tions Manager for Forum, wrote to
ex-President Harry S. Truman ask-
ing him to speak at State while he
was in Albany. He received a reply
from Truman stating that he could
not speak at State because his
schedule would not allow him time.
He also expressed his deep thanks
for having been asked. Mr. Truman
will speak in Albany tonight.

Buffians ferform
Ignoble Theft

Flash—Saturday night at the
dance, a bunch of Ruffians Per-
formed an Ignoble theft. They
stole the Junior class banner.
The thieves met with a rather
feeble resistance—it was one of
those “careful Percy—or I'll slap
you on the wristwatch" deals.

The banner is rather recogniz-
able as it carries the numerals
l-9-5-7, and is besmirched with
blood from previous victorious
campaigns. A description has
been furnished to area fences
and pawnbrokers, but this is
merely a formality since we
know the approximate location
of the banner.

Anyone who can furnish pert-
inent information, or who can
present the banner at the door
of the Junior Prom will be giv-
en a free bid announces Sara
Jane Duffy; President of the
Junior Class.

Singers Cry For Mole SupporlL
To Form Foundation For Chorus

"To every man give thine car but
few they voice." The "few" here up-
plies to the Music Department. In
short. this is a request from
recesses of Richardson for some re»
cruits to Collegiate Singers.

The Collegiate Singers- are -the
only mixed choral group on cumpus.
During their three your existence at
State, they have been one of the
most prominent features ut the
Spring Concert. and have been re-
ceived with great enthusiasm ut var-
ious outside engagements. The Sing-
ers have appeared at Faculty Tens,
The Albany Art Institute und ut Vu-
rious times have appeared on televi-
sion. The numbers are chosen from
the stuntitu'd chorul repertoire und
range from the classical numbers to
l)i.])llllll' songs

This request is directed particu-
larly to the male members here. As
was stressed above, this is a mixed
chorus so men. let‘s do a little mix-

ing. There is a shortage in the tenor,
bass and baritone sections, and with
such u wide choice. you should have
no trouble in finding the range.

Previous experience is desirable. so
if you have had any experience at
all in choral \vork. give it :1 try.

The director of Collegiate Singers
is Kurl A. B. Pctcrscn. Mr, Pctcrscn
hopes. in time, to build up this group
to u chorus of 75 voices. In past
years this group has always been re-
ceived with much enthusiasm, and
with a chorus of 75. the success of
the singers would be assured.

Those people intcrcsted in trying
out for the Singcrs should either see
Mr. Petersen. or attend the rehear—
snl Monday at twelve noon. The rc-
hcursuls are so scheduled that they
do not interfere with classes und so
there should be no serious trouble
on that score. So why not give both
yourself and the college a break by
trying Collegiate Singers.
