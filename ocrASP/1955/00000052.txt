Potter Club, 315, Gain Victories

As Intramural

The Intramural Football League
got off to a fast start this week as
some of last year's top teams con-
tinued on their winning ways.

Last season’s top team, Potter
Club, got off on the right foot with
a 12-0 win over the Vets. Quarter—
backed by Joe Zizzi. the Club scor-
ed their first TD as fleetfooted Joe
Anderson snagged the pigskin in
the end zone. The other score came
about when Bernie Theobold pounc-
ed on a fumble behind the goal line.
The play of John Rookwood did
much to help Potter.

APA, last season‘s No. 2 team.
was overcome in their initial fray
on some rugged play and a surprise
"sleeper" play by SLS who ended
up in the third position last season.

QB Randy Dudley caught the
Madison men off guard as he flip-
ped the leather to Jim Fitzsimmons
who mingled near the onlookers.
APA scored their two in the 6-2 tilt
on a safety. The game was close all
the way as SLS staved off three
APA TD bids from the five. The
credit for much of the State Street
Annex team's victory was due to Bill

Pods Win First
Against Hillyer

Last Saturday the State soccer
team vanquished a weak Hiliyer
College "11” by a score of 5-1 at
Bleecker Stadium.

From the opening kick-off to the
final gun State. spearheaded by
Paul Dammer's 3 goals, were in
command. In the first period Carl
Maxson booted a return deep into
Hillyer territory where Lou Delsig-
nore relayed the bail to Wendell
Fowler who split the nets. Near the
close of the period Paul Dammer
scored on a penalty kick for his
first of the day.

Early in the second period Ev
Weiermiller on a corner kick headed
the ball into the visitor's goal to
give the Feds a 3-0 lead. Just at
the close of the first half Fran
Nancetti was injured.

At the start of the second half
State wasted no time and promptly
began to press offensively. Paul
Dammer headed a pass from Bill
Bonesteel into pay dirt. The quarter
closed with both teams pressing.

In the final quarter State was
constantly on the attack but a quick
break by Hillyer gave the North-
men their first goal. As the gun
sounded Paul Dammer booted his
third of the day on a free kick.

Plattsburgh came back strong in
the second quarter and registered
their first tally of the day on a
hard blast to 'I‘ito's left. A penalty
kick midway through the period
gave the visitors a one goal margin
over the Feds.

At the beginning of the second
half State appeared to be complete-
ly rejuvenated and a Plattsburgh
goal only seemed to instill more
fight in them. On a fast break and
a corner kick Ev Weiermiller blast-
ed the ball into the visitor‘s net to
leave the statesmen trailing by a
single marker. State pressed even
harder and on a corner kick Paul
Dammer laced the tying marker
into the nets.

Delsig'nore Scores

On a. fast break downﬁeld and a
beautiful pass Lou Deisignore head-
ed the ball into Plattsburg nets for
the tie breaking marker. With only 9
minutes left in the game Plattsburgh
tied the score. and that's how it
remained for the rest of the game.

ed scoring on a penalty kick and
