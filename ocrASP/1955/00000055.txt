State Booters Lose First To G
 Drop Wednesday Game To U

Booters Unable
To Vanquisli 3-0
First Hall Lead

Apparently still recovering from
the Geneseo game. the Fed soccer
team took a 3-1 defeat from a con—
sistent Union College last Wednes-
day at Beverwyck Stadium. The loss
which was State's second of the
year saw the Garciamen, although
hustling all the while. unable to get
a play to click, while the visitors
just played consistant soccer and
took advantage of every break,

After keeping the ball in neutral
ground for 8 minutes the Unioniers,
with some pretty passing, scored the
game’s first tally. Just 50 seconds
later, the visitors caught the State
defense relaxing and they laced
their second goal into the nets to
take a 2—0 lead over a seemingly
listless State “11.” It seemed that
many of the injuries and bruises
sustained by the statesmen in the
Geneseo tilt were beginning to show,
causing the team to slow down. Sud-
denly the State "11," paced by hust-
ling Bob Backer and Capt. Bill
Bonesteel began to look like the
bustling tall club it is. The period
came to an end with the Feds on
the offensive.

Show Hustle

From the beginning of the socond
period on the Garciamcn outhustlcd
the Unionmen but couldn't trainer
:1 tally. A pile-up in front of the
Union goal brought the home team
close to pay dirt but the ball sailed
harmlessly over the nets. On it quick
break one of the Union players
arced the ball toward the Pod goni.
Tito Gugllclnionc, thinking the ball
out of play. let the ball go and it
dropped into the goal for Union's
third tally. State carried the attack
to Union but even with the Union
goalie on the ground, the Pods were
unable to get their first marker. The
first half closed with State on the
offensive but Union in tho load, 3-0.

Early in the second half Paul
Dammer, State's leading scorer who
was nursing a leg injury, was roinov-
ed from play after rcinjiiring tho
some. Led by Clll'l Muxson's lino
defensive play and the State for-
wui‘d line, the SLflLCSlllf‘ll pi'csscd
forward but were held scoreless for
the entire period.

KAMPF‘

Central High School, where he
played basketball and baseball as
well as soccer.

Weiermuller Clicks on Squad

One of the more talented Juniors
on the Feds is Ev Weiermuller. Ev
is noted for his powerful legs, and
his 5 foot 8 inch stature makes him
a speedy member of the Feds. Ev
hails from Wayland, N. Y., where
he attended Wayland Central High
School. He is an experienced ath-
lete, having had experience in soc-
cer, basketball and baseball.
Backer Earns Center Forward Spot

Another Junior who has shown
increased talent this year is Bob
Backer. Bob, who is 5 feet 9 inches
tall, has come forth with some fine
showings in the five games played
so far this year, and has earned a
place in thc center forward slot.
Carlo Place, N. Y., is Bob’s home-
town, and he attended Westbury
High School before coming to State.
Bob was a five letterman at West-
bury, starring in baseball, basket—
ball, soccer, cross country and track.

There you have the story on four
more of the Feds. There's only one
way to see them in person on the
playing field, and that's to show up
and cheer them over at Bleecker
Stadium when the Peds are home.
How about it?

By ZACK CLEMENTS

On a mud puddle field and in a driving rain the State
soccer team suffered its first loss of the season to a strong
Geneseo “11” on the latter’s field, last Saturday.

The Feds displayed brute courage from the opening

play until the final second.

Soaked from rain and mud

already, the Feds took the opening kickoff and carried the

ball into Geneseo territory where it remained until

Ed

Jones scored only six minutes after play began. Geneseo

To the Sports Editor:

The officers and advisors of AIMA
don’t want this letter to sound like
a gripe but we do want the student
body to know our feelings toward
athletic interest at State. For years
now the student body has expressed
its feelings toward more varsity ath-
letics. This has been an important
matter to all—male students espe-
cially. What we would like to know
is, how do the students at State ex-
pect to support any teams if there
is no participation in Intramural
activities? At present there are
about 175 freshman males in school.
There are 25 playing football. They
make up one complete team and
portions of others. This they call
participation. In total there are
about 800 males in school. There are
about nine football teams in the IM
league—a total of approximately
125 players. This, too, is called par-
ticipation. It is too late to help the
football league but there are many
more activities coming soon. Basket-
ball will begin in a short while.
Here is the chance to improve par-
ticipation. Sign up at the AMIA
bulletin board in lower Draper.

This week's Sport Spotlight shines
on APA's halfback Stan Davies. A
week ago Thursday when APA trip-
pcd the Vets, 16-0, Stan captured
the vision of all spectators when he
intercepted a pass and churned on
down the gridiron scoring the
touchdown which broke up a tie
game in the last quarter and spark-
ed APA to their first victory of the
season. Stan's gluc fingers also
grasped many offensive passes in-
cluding two which accounted for
extra poliits. Sport Spotlight con-
gratulates you Stun for a well play-
ed game.

immediately carried the ball into
State ground and only fine play by
fullbacks Gene Scott and Carl Max-
son as well as Bob Backer who
hustled throughout on offense, pre-
vented them from scoring. After
holding off the home team's attack
the Feds suddenly broke loose and
Ed Jones scored again on a hard
smash into pay dirt. No further scor-
ing occured during the rest of the
period.

Tito Guglielmone, State goalie,
playing his best game of the year,
made save after save to keep the
Feds in the lead.

Play In Mud

At the start of the second half

Geneseo took the kickoff and
immediately began to press a
crushing offensive attack. Time and
time again Geneseo kicks were
blocked by Tito, constant scrambles
were taking place in front of the
State goal. With five minutes gone,
a penalty kick was awarded the
home team and they converted it
into the first Geneseo tally. Another
penalty kick was awarded Geneseo
and the tying marker was blasted
past Tito. Pressing hard, a Gene-
seo tally ended the period with
Geneseo now leading, 3-2.

In spite of State's courageous
playing, the superior Geneseo scor-
ed one more goal and held off the
ﬁghting statesmen until the ﬁnal
gun sounded.

Lorricliio Leads Raclret
Men ln AMlA Tourney

Everything was going in set order,
when the clouds opened up and
dampened the tennis courts beyond
playing condition.

Jim Loricchio was leading the
field with three straight set vic-
tories. In the quarter finals, his vic-

, tlin was Dave Champagne by scores

of 6-2, 6-1, thus putting him alone
in the semi-finals.

The tournament opened two weeks
ago. with a field of twenty-five par-
ticipating. The hopes of many were
torn down, as defaults and defeats
lifted twelve of them. Bob Kampf,
Jim Loricchio, and Carin Virgilio
had first round victories, while all
others advanced via byes and de-
faults.

In the longest match to date, Paul
Erickson defeated Bob Kampf in
thirty-eight games, 6-2, 8~10, 6-4.
Erickson played fine tennis, and
could prove to be the dark horse of
thetoui'nament. He was joined in
the quarters by Dave Greenburg,
Hank Storch, Dave Champagne,
Dick Paige, Mort Katz, and Jim
Safford.
