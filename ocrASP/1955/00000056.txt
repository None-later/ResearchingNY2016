'Gallup Poll Predicts Nixon Win,-
Frznch North Africa Warries US.

By DOMINIC DeCECCO

Overseas . . .

Washington is concerned about
the French policy in North Africa.
The Faure government seems head-
ed for collapse unless the Berber
revolts are quieted. The French
army reservists are balking at duty
in North Africa. Should there be a
revolt in the French army. it would
upset the entire NATO organiza-
tion.

Egypt's order for MIGs from
Czechoslovakia has caused much
friction in the Israeli-Arab dispute.
Most Arab governments are back-
ing up Egypt’s move. Israel has an

' order for Mystere IV jets from
France. Supremacy in the air seems
to be the main objective of the two
countries. Peaceful settlement of the
issues is being worked on by Eric
Johnston, special envoy and Assist-
ant Secretary of State George V.
Allen.

The National Scene . . .

Still in the spotlight is the Presi-
dential race for 1956. According to
a Gallup Poll on leading Republi-
can candidates, Richard Nixon
seems to be favored Chief Justice

,Earl Warren made a surprisingly

good showing and should not be
counted out of the race entirely.
Christian A. Herter, Governor of
Massachusetts. is being pushed by
Eastern Republicans as a block to
Nixon‘s nomination.

The Democratic leaders remain
stable with Stevenson, Kefauver
and Harriman as the three top
contenders. Kefauver's age is being
played up by his supporters. He is
the youngest of the three i52i, while
Stevenson is 55 and Harriman. 63.

The major problem both parties
face is the depression the Midwest
farmer is in at the moment. These
are key states which will hold the
balance of power in an election. If

Debate Novices
Enter Practices

Debate Council has worked out a
well-rounded schedule of novice de-
bates with area colleges, announces
Phyllis Lyeth '56. President. In the
next few weeks. debates between
novice teams from State and those
from Siena, RPI. and Union will
take place. During the coming week,
State's novices will debate with
Siena. Last week they engaged in
debates with the College of Saint
Rose and RPI.

The purpose of these debates is
to prepare State's novice debaters
for the tournaments to be held at
both Hamilton and Dartmouth in
November.

Any freshman or upperclassman
interested in debating on this year‘s
topic, “Resolved that the non—agri-
cultural industries of the US. should
guarantee their employees an an-
nual wage." is asked to contact
either Miss Lyeth oi' Clyde Reeves,
Assistant Professor of English, for
further information.

Chairman of the Education Books
Rebate Committee.

The money will be distributed for

you recall, Truman carried all Mid-
west states and went on to victory.
Democrats are going to play up the
idea of the return to rigid price
supports. The hog farmers, incid-
entally, have had a forty-six per
cent drop in prices in the last year
and a half. They are the people who
will listen to any idea of a change.

The recent investigations being
conducted by a Senate subcommit-

without the jurors consent has
raised a storm of praise and protest.

should be abandoned while others
maintain" that the jury system is
the most democratic fonm of trial.

This eavesdropping was only an
experiment by the University of

an experiment! Let us not try to
intimidate jurors as we have other
innocent people through telephone

For New Dorm

Preliminary work has begun on a
new dormitory to be constructed on

Western Avenue as part of the dor-
mitory quadrangle. Initial surveying
to determine elevations and other
necessary material for the use of
the architect was in progress last
Monday and Tuesday.

The dormitory will hold approxi-
mately 200 students and will be L
shaped. The main part of the L will
be parallel to Brubacher and will
back up to the edge of Dorm Field
as do the other halls. The territory
on Western Avenue to be taken up
by this construction will be from
287-289 to 307-309. The send part of
the, L will be perpendicular to the
main section and will stretch over
the area of the present Chi Sigma
Theta Sorority Hottse and one cor-
ner will almost reach the sidewalk.
This will leave 307-309 Western
Avenue a vacant lot.

The new hall will be strictly a.
residence hall with no food services
provided. However. accommodations
will be made to feed the residents
on campus. The exact arrangement
will be announced later. Outside of
this the rooms and subsidiary ac-
commodations will be like those of
Brubacher.

Although the exact planning is
not too far advanced it can be an-
nounced that H. O. Fullerton of Al—
bany has been awarded the job as
architect. Mr. Fullerton was the
architect for Pierce. Sayles and
Brubacher. As in these three dorms
the same form. Georgian architec-
ture, will be followed.

Barring any unforscen circum-
stances the work on the dorm will
begin about April ﬁrst with the ﬁrst
piece of work to be the removal of
the present structures. Occupancy
of the dorm should begin Septem-
ber, 1957.

Plans are now being formulated
in construct a second dorm on that
territory between this new dorm
and Partridge Street and work
should begin shortly after the coin-
pleiion of the present project

aders from RPI will furnish the
music for the Homecoming Weekend
Dance in Brubacher main dining
room. A Jazz Concert will be pre-
sented by Music Council in Bru-
bzicher Sunday to close the weekend
festivities.

Homecoming Weekend was first
instituted at State in 1953. It was
set up for the purpose of “creating
closer feelings between the alumni
and undergraduate students." At
this time the graduates of the '51,
'52, and ’53 classes were invited,
since the alien was planned espe—
cially for them. Since this time in
its short history, this event has
grown and this year, it large crowd

"Weekend." and another new idea,
is a parade to Bleecker Stadium in
which the Queen of the Junior
Prom will participate Music will be
