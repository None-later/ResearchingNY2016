STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. OCTOBER 28. 1955

 

 

     

(Continued from Page 2, Column 2)

make any more elaborate improve-
ments on the situation.

In order to prove my point,
would like to cite the example of
the recent Faculty Teas which were
held on Sunday the 23rd. I would
like to consider the teas from the
student's standpoint since that is
the only one from which I am quali-
fied to speak.

We realize from past years that
these teas can be very pleasant af-
fairs, but they can also be a great
bother and head-ache. The ﬁrst
thing which must be done is to send
out the invitations to the over 300
faculty and staff members. This is
not only time consuming. but ex-
pensive. Secondly, there is the prob-
lem of refreshments. It is quite dif-
ﬁcult to plan a tea when you have
only the roughest idea of how many
people will attend. Not only do you
have to have an ample supply, but
the problem of surpluses arises. Or-
dinarily, approximately forty fac-
ulty members can be expected. This
year 15 out of 300 attended. I do
not think anyone can dispute the
implications of this small propor-
tion. Needless to say, any estima—
tions based on previous experiences
were useless.

The teas are annual affairs in all
seven dormitories on campus. Us-
ually two or more will hold their’s
on the same day in order to avoid
as much imposition on the facul-
ty‘s time as is possible. This means
that on four (at the most) Sundays
out of the 10 school months, there
are teas. (I realize I have not in-
cluded the fraternity Open Houses,
but they may speak for themselves.)

There are several questions on this
subject for which I do not know the
answers. First, are the faculty mem-
bers disinterested in the faculty-
student relations, or is their time
really so scarce that they are un-
able to put in even the briefest ap-
pearances? Second, is it necessary
to continue this yearly affair if only
a few of the faculty members (and,
strangely enough, the same few)

are going to attend? Third, is it fair
to anyone to expect these few to
carry the burden of attending the
functions when so many others are
disinterested or unable?

I know for myself that I greatly
enjoy informal meetings with the
faculty members, but I think this
tea is a big bother for nothing. I
know many who agree with me.
Does the faculty feel the same way?

Perhaps something can be done
to improve the present apathetic
(or is it pathetic) situation. I know
for my own group that we would
welcome any suggestions from
others.

Before closing, I would like to
thank the 15 "regulars" who at-
tended the function. We certainly
enjoyed seeing you. In particular, I
would like to thank the President of
the College who, although he had a
meeting at four o’clock, attended the
teas and the two Open Houses
scheduled the same day.

For obvious reasons, I will leave
my name from this letter. I am not
ashamed of my attitudes, but I am
speaking, not as an individual, but
as a member of a group within the
student body.

An Open Letter to the Newly-
Elected Representatives:

The paper today features many
articles referring to the resolution
proposed by Debate Council in re-
gard to setting aside of one hour 3.
night. alternate Thursdays, for
practically exclusive religions club
meetings. At first examination, this
proposal seems the logical one for
solving our social calendar's prob-
lems. Religion does and should hold
a prominent, if not the prominent
position in a college student's life.
Yet, the proposal was defeated at
Student Council, by a vote of twelve
to five. And, in addition, alternate
proposals and amendments were de-
feated not by a close vote, but over-
whelmingly. Your entire Sophomore
and Senior Class representatives op—
posed the latest resolution, and as

the one Junior who did, I would
like to attempt to explain why.

Last week a resolution was intro-
duced in Debate Council's name
that had not even been considered
by Debate Council. After the reso-
lution was proposed, Debate Coun-
cil met hurriedly immediately before
the Student Council meeting, to ap-
prove it. It does not seem logical to
arrive at a decision and then justify
it afterwards, rather isn’t the or-
dinary method to have the resolu-
tion grow out of discussion? But this
fact, interesting though it may be,
is not enough to defeat the resolu-
tion, for mistakes in parliamentary
procedure are common occurrences
which can be overlooked.

We might consider the statements
that passage of this motion would
ease the confused social calendar.
This is hard to understand. Closing
off one night, or part of one night
will not ease other nights already
jammed with meetings. But this is
not enough to defeat it.

Why, then, did Student Council
vote overwhelming against it? I can
only answer for myself.

Religious clubs representatives
have alternately maintained that
members are hard to get at meet-
ings, and that their meetings are
a success. Both cannot be true, but
if the latter is, the motion is easny
defeated. There is little point in
discussing the matter if membership
is at a peak. If the former is true,
as we have reason to believe, for is
there any organization at State Col-
lege that is not suffering from the
same dilemma, we might point out.
a few facts. Is it conceivable that
we are going to get more members
at religious meetings by forcing
them to attend on a negative basis
—that is by providing them no other
place to go for a limited time pe-
riod. Or is it not true that the only
way membership will increase is by
providing some stimulus that will
induce members to attend, namely
interesting meetings, or by making
students aware of their religious ob—

---eammum'c¢fimcd---

ligations by effective personal con-
tact, Closing off a meeting time is
not going to result in the majority
of students, who do not now attend
religious clubs, eagerly participat-
ing in them. The simple fact is that
Thursday nights take relatively few
amounts of students for groups. The
great majority are in the dorms.
They are not attending governmen-
tal meetings and worrying about
conflicts with religious obligations.

There are those students who, un-
happlly, face conflicts. This is eas-
ily solved. Policies of government
are determined by the majority and
if the majority feels that a Thursday
night meeting hinders its religious
participation, then a vote is easily
held to have the committee meet-
ing some other time. A point was
made that the students will be
thrown off committees if they at-
tend religious club meetings. Does
this really seem sensible to you? We
must realize that there is a size-
able number of students who engage
in other activities. Do we have the
right to say they cannot meet be-
cause we would rather see them at
a religious club meeting? Religion
is not something you legislate. It is
a personal, and an individual mat-
ter.

The resolution asks for just one
hour, and it looks reasonable. Are
religious clubs going to confine their
meetings just to that one hour, and
how many of you girls, for instance,
in WAA, are going trooping down to
Page Gym, which you ﬁght to get
one night a week. namely Thurs-
day, at 9 o'clock to play basketball?

As long as this resolution would
further confuse the calendar by
eliminating most of one meeting
night, as long as it would offend a
sizeahle portion of students, and by
all voting indications, the majority,
then. it would seem to be something
that Student Council members must
defeat. They have done so.

There are many, many other rea—
sons why you must take into care-
ful consideration what your Student

In a cold driving rain the State
soccer team was defeated by a
strong R..P.I. “11" last Monday on
lhc latter‘s field by a score of 2—0.

Under menacing skies the R.P.I.
mcn began to press offensively but
wcrc met with a formidable Ped
defense. The ball was constantly
exchanged with neither team scor-
ing. Shortly after Fran Nancetti
was removed frmn the game, the
Engineers scored their first goal.

Rain Comes

During the entire second period
the Feds pressed offensively and
playch fine defense as well. Sudden-
ly it began to rain and snow. and
the sky became so dark that the
lights had to be turned on. The
ficld became slick and mud puddles
humpcrcd play. The period ended
with neither tcmn scoring.

With the field so slippery ihc

Last Wednesday the State soccer
“11" pulled out a 3-1 overtime thrill-
er to defeat Adelphi College and
gain their second home win on Bob
Backer's goal.

The statesmen took the opening
kickoff and carried the bill] into the
visitors' territory where it remained
until State was awarded a penalty
kick which Bill Bonesteel converted
into the Fed's first score of the day
only two minutes after play had
begun. The home team remained in
visitors' territory for the majority
of the period with Bob Backer and
Ed Jones leading the way offen-
sively. In the few moments of this
period that Adelphi did have the
ball in Ped ground it was cleared
quickly by fullback Carl Maxson.

The second period was featured
by fine defensive play by both
teams especially the Islander's
goalie who was a thorn in the Fed‘s

Last Saturday a tough Middle-
bury Collcgc soccer team defeated
Lhc State “11" on the formcr's field
by 11 4-1 margin.

The home team scorcd once in the
first period. once in the third and
twice in the fourth whilc State's
lone lully was scored by Ed Jones
in the second period.

This Saturday the Pods travel to

are asked to contact Ken Kadet, 59.

Next Wednesday at Bleecker Sta-
dium the Garciumen return home

Bridgeport “11".

side all day. Sloppy play kept the
Garciamen from capitalizing on sev-
eral scoring opportunities. During
this period goalie Tito Guglielmone
made several key stops to prevent
the Citymen from scoring. The half
came to a close with State leading
1-0.

Pods 0n Defense

The start of the second half saw
the Adelphi "11" come out and be-
gin to dominate play, causing the
Feds to go on the defensive. Heads
up play by A1 Lederman and some
pretty ball handling by Lou Delsig-
norc kept State in the game. Coach
Garcia at this point brought in a
few of his subs who held the fort
for the remaining time in the pe-
riod.

The final quarter was nearly en-
tirely consumed in front of either
team's goal. Each team was press-
ing—then taking the defensive. With
only 6 minutes left to play it looked
like State was going to coast to a
victory when the knotting marker
was headed in on a corner kick.
Goalie Tito Guglielmone was drawn
out of the nets and the ball bound-
ed over his head for the tally.

The regulation game came to a
conclusion with State on the of-
fensive, narrowly missing two goals.

Backer Scores

In the overtime the Garciamen
took the kick-off and marched into
the visitor's territory and began to
press a crushing offensive attack.
After two of the five minute period
had elapsed Ed Jones placed a cor-
ner kick perfectly to hustling Bob
Backer who scored the tie breaking
tally. Just tWo minutes later Carl
Maxson who had been moved to a
forward position came in alone and
scored the Fed's fourth goal just as
the gun sounded ending the period.
