Vote Against "Europeanization"
Results In Saar Gov't,l Resignation

By MALCOLM ROGERS

The world political spotlight is
focused on Europe currently with
several important developments tak-
ing place there. The government
of Premier Johannes Hoffman of
the Saar resigned this week because
of an overwhelming vote on the part
of the Saarlanders against the
“Europeanization” plan which was
supported by his pro-French govern-
ment. Major factors in voting were
the unpopularity of the Hoffman
regime and the basic ethnological
ties to the Germanic people as op-
posed to the French. This vote will
probably increase tension between
France and Germany and heap more
burdens upon the already shaky
shoulders of the Faure government.
One can not help think of 1935
when a similar election ended in a

similar vote. Let's hope that two
powers can settle this difficulty
reasonably and that there is not an
epidemic of intense nationalism in
either country.

The Geneva Conference of For-
eign Ministers is again tackling the
problems of German reunification
and European security. The Wes-
tern powers will demand a treaty
signed by the Big Four and a
united Germany which will provide
safeguards against aggression. It is
strange that a nation we would
have "agriculturalized" ten years
ago is now being wooed by both the
East and the West, engaged in a
titantic ideological struggle. The in-
dustrial strength of Germany and
its strategic location in Europe may
well be the factors which tip the
scales in years to come.

Asia seems to be shining with the
light from new democracies on her
underside even though broad ex-
panses to the north are in eternal
darkness. South Vietnam has de-
posed Emperor Bao Dal in favor of
a republican type government head-
ed by Premier Ngo Dinh Diem. By
an absolute landslide. Diem stic-

Frosh Apologize
To Sophomores

Judy Vimmerstedt '56, Chairman
of Warnings Commission of Mys-
kanla, announces that the following
freshmen received two or more
w a rn in g s from upperclassmen:
Richard Carey, four and ﬁve warn-
ings; Edward Wevcr and Richard
Barﬂeld, three warnings; and Don—
na Divens and Barbara Forsythe,
two warnings. The Chairman of
Warnings Commission also announ—
ces that Richard Barfleld. Richard
Carey, and Edward Wevcr will make
their apologies in the Sophomore
class meeting on Tuesday, Novem-
ber 1.

The upperclassmen have given a
total number of one hundred nine
warnings to the freshman class so
far.

Freshmen who receive their first
warning are warned that such a
violation is not to be repeated, A
second offense means that the of-
fender is to have his or her name
published in the State College News.
and a third, an apology before the
Sophomore class.

Commerce, DE Clubs
Give Hallowe'en Party

Bruce Wise '56, President oi' Coni-
merce Club, announccs that. the
Commerce Club will hold thcir un-
nuul Haliowc'cn Party in conjunc-
tion with tho Distributive Educa-
tion Club. Thursday at 7:30 pm. in
the Brubachcr smull dining room
this year. All conimcrcc studcnts,

ceeded in unseating the Emperor
who has governed the nation as well
as anyone could from the French
Riviera. The United States and the
Republic of France have already an-
nounced their support of Diem’s
government and thus it probably
will survive. Another colonial peo-
ples have shown great judgment in
their voting behavior; this may well
be a major lesson for Britain, France
and the other colonial powers to
consider.

We might mention in passing that
the United Nations celebrated its
tenth birthday this week. This body
born in the mind of Franklin Roose-
velt is, as he was, either loved or
despised; it is the debating society
of Robert McCormack or Cabot
Lodge's instrument for world peace.
I am reminded, however, of a speech
by Bishop Sheen in which he re-
minded his audience that peace has
two spellings with two somewhat
divergent meanings.

"Smiles" Admits

New Members

Smiles has accepted seven new
members this week, according to
Mary Knight ’57, President of the

Ruffles, and Barbara Rosen. Those

awarded voting membership after

Miss Knight also states that
Smiles is adding another service in
the near future. The organization
plans to accompany Albany public
school students who are interested
on excursions to places of civic in-
terest. These trips shall take place
on legal holidays when school is
not in session.

Smiles also supervises many other
activities for the benefit of children
living in the City of Albany, states
Miss Knight.
