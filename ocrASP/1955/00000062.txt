ond semester last year from the As-
sociated Collegiate Press. This rat-
ing was awarded to the News after
comparing it with other papers on
the same classification. Separate
features of the paper were scored
according to merit. The News was
rated superior for its editorials and

SC Airs Plans
On School Camp

Monday night there will be a
meeting of Student Council in the
Government Room at Brubacher.
This meeting will replace the usual
Wednesday night meeting.

Wednesday night at 7:30 pm. in
Brubacher’s game room there will
be a general airing and discussion
on the possible uses of the surplus.
The current surplus is $17,637.

Also at this meeting, the possi—
bility of purchasing a College Camp
will be discussed. The camp is locat-
ed near Warrensburg. N. Y. Yester-
day, a group of students went up
and viewed the property, and at this
meeting, they will give their re-
ports. Members of the administra-
tion will be on hand to answer any
questions pertaining to the camp.

One of the features of this camp
is a pond located in the middle of
the site. The name of this pond is
Dippekill. It is three—eighths miles
long and one-half mile wide. There
are 700 acres included with this
pond for the cost of $10,000. The ad-
ministration has checked into the
details carefully and approved the
possibility of our purchasing it.
Sunday, another group will make the
trip to Warrensburg to inspect this
site. Warrensburg is about 75 miles
north of Albany on Route 9, just a
short distance from Lake George.
This site would serve as a fresh
camp, and afford a spot for various
athletic events.

SOIL

In keeping with news standards, -
the News was rated excellent in ‘

such things as coverage, features,
sports coverage, typography and

makeup. The short new features .'

are written in the best professional
style, whereas the “Common-Stator"

was warned against using pointless ‘-

and non-essential material.

The majority of the physical prop- ' "

ertles of the News were considered

excellent. Pictures on page one were -

well placed, however, the display
below the fold could be improved.
Pictures could be used more fre-
quently throughout the paper. In
general the typography of the News,
according to the scorebook, is at~
tractive and easy to read.

Previous to this new rating the
News was second class. The judge's
final comment was: “You are do—
ing better this semester. Let’s go

over the top next time." The only man. Juniors, as they put the finishing touches on the floats to be worn

Assembly Airs Views I
On School Camp Purchase

Administration Answers Queries
0n Financial, Technical Aspects

Last Wednesday evening a special assembly was held
in Brubacher to discuss the possible uses of surplus. The
main point for suggested expenditure at this time is the
proposed purchase of a school camp located north of Al-
bany in the Adirondacks. Dr. Evan R. Collins, President
of the College, and Dr. Oscar Lanford, Dean of the College,
were present to represent the administration and answer
any questions possible in regards to its physical make-up
or problems of purchasing it.

The discussion of the camp opened with a report by
Bruce King ’56, Chairman of the Surplus Committee out
of Student Council on the technical aspects of the camp.
King told the group that the camp consists of approxim-
ately 700 acres near Warrensburg, N. Y., which is about 75
miles north of Albany. The area the camp encompasses is
undeveloped woodland with a lake located approximately
in the center. The cost of the campsite in its present con-
dition is $10,000.

Possible uses for the territory were mentioned in the
report. Those listed were possibilities of use as a field
station for the Biology department,
recreation, a base for the workings
of Outing Club, a center for a Camp-
ing Education program, a workshop
for the Summer Theater Group, and
with expansion of facilities it could
be used as a frosh camp sometline
in the future.

Rush Season
To Open With

Annual Smoker

Fraternity rushing for freshmen
and transfers will open with the
annual Fraternity Smoker to be held
Monday evening. The reception will
take place in Brubacher dining
room at 7:30 pm, announces Rich-
ard Tinapp '56. President of Inter
Fraternity Council.

All statesmen who are interested
in fraternity life and its relaton-
ship and importance on the campus
are urged to attend. Each of the
four fraternities will present enter-
tainment and will give a history
of their organization, fees for incin-
bers, and a statement of the purpose
for which the organization was foun—
dcd.

Cigarettes will be provided for
those attending. Refreshments con-
sisting of potato chips and coke
will also be served.

In response to an inquiry as to
the operation of other State Teach-
crs' College camps Student Counc1l
minutes were read which included a
survey of these units made three
years ago.

Discussion followed on the devel-
opment of the area. It was pointed
out that the cost of erecting bulld-
ings might be defrayed by using
student and faculty labor. In this
way it was felt that the project
would help to tie the students and
faculty of the college closer together.
The fact was also brought out that
the development of the camp would
not be completed within a short
period of time but rather a slow lin-
provement. This means that the
camp could not be used for a fresh
camp immediately. President Coi-
lins pointed out, in response to the
suggestion of a mortgage to pay for
the construction of facilities, that
