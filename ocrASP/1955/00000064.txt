STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. NOVEMBER ii. 1955

Labor Unions Near Unification,-

Threet Looms in

Middle East

By DOMINICK DeCECCO

The Nation . . .

It is generally accepted that
President Eisenhower will make
known his political plans by Janu-
ary 20, the third anniversary in his
job. Vice-President Nixon is being
cautious about announcing his poll-
tieai intentions until President Eis-
enhower settles the issue with his
announcement. We guess that Presi-
dent Eisenhower will not run again
and will not back up any individual
in his announcement.

While the major newspapers are
announcing the record breaking
profits of most U.S. corporations
the farmers’ plight seems to be
pushed aside. It is true that big
business is in a state of general
prosperity, but who put them there?
The farmer, of course. The farmer
is finding it harder and harder to
get a good price for his wares on
the market. If his income goes down
he will naturally curtail his buying.
When this is done the industrialists
will find themselves advocating
higher price supports for the farmer
in order to regain their purchasing
power.

On the political side we must not
forget that the farm bloc in the
Mid-West controls one hundred
thirty-one votes which can turn the
election either way. The farmers'
plight is the key issue in the 1956
election and both the Democrats
and the Republicans are fighting
for control. The farmers blame the
present administration for their
losses and will probably be willing
to listen to a change.

Crisis . . .

While we are entangled in a poll-
tical hassle here in the U.S., a big
threat is looming in the Middle East
between Israel and Egypt along the
demilitarized zone. The Arab bloc
seems to be playing East against
West in order to gain more conces-
sions from both sides. Russia is un-
derselling the Western powers on
the sale of arms to the East. Should

the Arab bloc buy arms from Russia
or her satellites they could easily
pose a great menace to Israel.
Unification . . .

George Meany and president of
010, met last week and announced
the partial completion of the merger
of the two unions. The unified group
will be called the American Federa-
tion of Labor-Congress of Industrial
Organizations and will control about
fourteen and one-half million mem-
bers. Meany will head the organiza-
tion with Reuther becoming Vice-
President.

Distributive Ed
Plans Field Trip

The Distributive Education Club
is planning an all day field trip
and conference at Bresee‘s Oneonta
Department Store, Wednesday, No-
vember 16, it was announced by
Erwin Horowitz, '55, President of the
club.

The program for the day will in-
clude a brief morning session, lunch-
eon ln the store restaurant, a tour
of the store, and a final conference
to discuss the organizational policies
and operating policies of the store.
The group will be guests of the
store executives at luncheon.

Bresee‘s Department Store is na-
tionally famous and was featured in
an issue of Collier’s Magazine sev-
eral years ago for its outstanding
promotional activities.

The trip is part of a larger pro-
gram of trips. conferences, and oth-
er special functions designed to
give practical experience and infor-
mation to Distributive Education
students. Transportation will be pro-
vided by charter bus and there will
be forty-one students in the group,
according to Reno S. Knouse, Pro-
fessor of Merchandising.

Coach Sauers has his boys going
through steady and hard driving
drills down at Page Gym these days.
After two weeks of practice, the Feds
are beginning to shape into a well
organized ball club. It is still too
early to elaborate on just how the
Feds will look against opposition.
However, last week it was stated that
the hoop squad had new blood. was
in need of improvement, and featur-
ed speed and height with what it
has. This week we bring you a
story on the veterans of last year's
squad.

kctbull season he will with our ex-
panded athletic program give him
more opportunities to use new meth-
ods and techniques, show his worth
11nd show State the importance of a
good athletic trainer. This look to
the future is also 11 long View, for
plans are now being formulated to
have 11 second training room in the
gymnasium for the basketball sea-
son. This plan rests on the affirma-
tive vote of President Collins and
it is hoped that we will have this
training room opened soon. When
we get our field house it will con-
tain 11 training room. However when
the field house is in construction
the time will have arrived to consid-
cr seriously the hiring of a full time
trainer to handle not only athletes
but any student who has an injury
rehabilitation problem.
Thanks All

By the way in closing I would like
to thank President Collins for mak-
ing available a place for me to
practice my profession. I Would like
to thank Coucth Garcia and Hath-
11w11y for leaching me vul'lous train-
ing mcthods 11nd for being so p11-
1111-nt with me in times of slow as-
similutions of those methods. Above
oil I would like to thank the 11th-
lctcs 11nd students for being so co-
operative and for showing an inter-
cst in our athletic training pro-
grnm. Lastly 11 hearty good luck to
Dave Ferris '59, in the i’utiu‘c years
us athletic trainer.

Yours in 11 better sports Program

Garciamen Filth
Loss Oi Season

Before a large homecoming crowd
the State soccer “11" were handed
their‘worst loss of the season by a
hustling Bridgeport team, 6-1. The
loss was the fifth of the year for
the Feds.

The Feds took the kickoff but the
ball was held in neutral territory by
both teams. Paul Dammer who has
just returned to action stood out in
a defensive role. After 18 minutes of
play the Conn. men broke through
the Ped defense and their ace Pete
Belmont ripped the nets for the
first B.U. goal. In this period three
State shots were taken but all were
missed.

Visitors Score 2

After only 5 minutes of the sec-
and period a tripping penalty was
called on the Feds and Belmont
once again tallied for the visitors
sending the ball to goalie Tito Gug—
llelmone's left. Ed Jones, Wieremil-
icr and Carl Mnxson were all hustl-
ing on the front line but were un-
able to negotiate the ball past B.U.
goalie Jim Davidson. In the back-
field Bill Bonesteel, All Lederman
Hollis Tibbets were playing their
usually consistent ball game. On a
fast break “Baffling Bob" broke
loose and narrowly missed a goal as
the bail went just to the left of the
visitors goal. With only 4 minutes
left to play in the half, B.U.'s Bob
Sveda smashed another shot by T1-
:tso and the visitors led by a score of
~0.

Belmont Scores Again

After only 5 minutes of the sec-
