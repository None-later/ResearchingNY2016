State Basketball Squad Begins Year;
Locals Face RPI At Union College Today

The first basketball weekend of the season at State
College opens today when the Feds take on their ﬁrst
two foes—Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and New
Paltz State College. Tonight the men of Coach Rich-
ard Sauei's take to the road as they encounter the
Engineers at the newly constructed Field House of
Union College. Tomorrow the Feds will open their
home version of the '55-'56 season as they play host

The bench strength Sauers has on hand will be
led by speedy Joe Anderson and last year's top man
in assists. Denny Dempster. The others expecting to
see action are Richard Causey and Thomas Happy.

This year will prove to be a big test for Coach
Sauers. The Slippery Rock Teachers and Penn State
graduate is undertaking his ﬁrst assignment as a
college basketball coach. He replaces Merlin Hatha-

to the Hawks of New Paltz. The game is scheduled way, State's Physical Education Department head

to get under way at 8:30 pm. after a 7 pm. pre—

liminary by the Junior Peds.

State has not beaten RPI since World War II, and
tonight they will be out to avenge last year's 67-59
defeat. The locals, used to Page‘s small gym will
have their bucks to the wall on the large hardwood
of Union. State‘s new mentor, Richard Sauers. is
looking to Captain Sigmund Smith to repeat last
year's performance against the Tri-City area foes.

Sauers is expected to start this year's captain along
with Donald Mayor, Denny Dempster, John Rook-
wood, and Jack Minon. The only new face to appear
on the starting lineup will be that of Gary Holvny.
a six-foot-iwo-inch prospect who is expected to sec

much action this year.

Being the ﬁrst game of the season for both squads,
prognostications of the outcome are few and far

between.

On Saturday night, the Pods will he opposing the
New Paltz State College on the small Page gym. The

starting lineup is expected to be

Friday night's outcome proves inﬂuential in any way.

Last year the Albanians nosed out the Hawks by a
count of 84-76. Once again Sigmund Smith proved to
be the big man for the Teachers as he found the

range for twenty points.
