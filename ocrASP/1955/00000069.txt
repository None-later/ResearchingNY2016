Now that the horse is stolen, let‘..
close the door. Every year about
this time everyone complains how
rough the IM grid stars perform on
the field of battle. Every year some-
one says, "JUSt wait till someone
gets hurt.”

Well that piece of linen wrapped
around one member of the Vets
football squad isn't exactly a scarf.
Someone did get hurt. It‘s time to
do something—not talk—act.

We dare say that 90"; of the close
body contacts and bruises are not
due to enmity between the per-
formers. In a. league as close as the
one just completed it's only natural
that players will play a little hard-
er and be a. bit more aggressive.
The "will to win" and developing
tension in the game unconsciously
bring about “dirty play" that most
spectators talk of. As unintentional
as it may be, however. it still does
not stop the bruises any.

What is needed is the protection
of padding and uniforms. There 
no place in State's sports program
for a touch league anymore, True
it may cost quite a bit but why
couldn‘t we start. off with but four

Bowlers Drop
To Third Place

It was either all or nothing fer
State's bowling team in their last

two matches. In their contest
against Union, November 22, I the
locals picked up all five points.

strengthening their hold on second
place and racking up a new high
triple of 2634 pins. Sophomore Joc
Clement took high honors with a
triple of 563, on singles of 199. 184,
and 180. Dick Weinple came out
second best with a 555 total, follow-
ed by Al Stephenson with 534 and
John Zidik with 528.

RP] Takes Five

Last Tuesday evening, however,
told an entirely different story RPI
shut out the luckiess locals, taking
all five points and dropping them
into third place behind the up—zind-
coming Sicna keglers. Phil Carpcn-
tier led the Engineers with i123?)
single, topping the previous high,
232. rolled by State's own Tom Sul-
livan earlier in the season. The Feds
_1ust couldn't get going and were
snowed under by RPI's games of
819. 840, and 948.

State. is now 2-1—21 with the Lcii—
guc. four games back of seconds
place Sienn and two in from ill
fourth-place RPI.

IM teams and work from there. It’s
much better to let loose of a little
money than sustain a few more
bruises.

The uniforms would likewise pro-
tect the players from another dan-
ger—the poor playing conditions of
the field. Dorm Field, which acts
like a sponge, holds water for
two days after one of Albany's fre-
quent downpours. Beverwyck like-
wise does not have the smoothest
terrain in the Capitol District.
Cleats could prevent much of the
slipping due to sneaks and Dorm
Field and also act as a better ankle
protector against the gopher holes
of the Washington Street field.

Also consider spectator interest.
It inevitably will increase. Although
we still can’t see football as 21 var-
sity sport, perhaps interest would
increase to such a point that it
would be foreseeable in the not-too-
far-away future.

The plan for action is now. It
>nn't be done by individuals. Groups
such as the f‘rats and group houses
must approach AMIA heads collec-
tively. We sincerely hope all groups
will express their desires.
