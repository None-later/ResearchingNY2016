ANN LUFT

Aim Luft, Editor; Dorothy Rasmus-
sen, Business Manager. Seniors;
Trudy Stemmer and Beth Beehler,
Junior Editors.

The conference formally opened
with a joint meeting of editorial and
business yearbook delegates, Friday.
November 18. Judges of ACP and
yearbook advisors discussed “What
Are We and What Are We Doing?"
The delegates then attended sec-
tional meetings concerning budget
problems, photography, and prob-
lems in editing the modern year-
book.

Discussion of the problems of the
modern yearbook in a panel session,
pointed up that many editors and
board members are either salaried
or given scholarships for their work.
A point well taken was the sugges—
tion that the Editor be named in
March preceding the Senior y air,
that preparation may begin early on
the book for the following year.

The panel discussion “Before and
After the Click of the Shutter" was
concerned in the main with cautions
to editors to use simplicity. “A good
picture is a simple picture." Tilted
and odd shaped photographs were
frowned on us ineffective. The year-
book and the pictures in it should
first and foremost tell the story of
the y ‘ar,

In several meetings staff organiza-
tion was brought up as a matter of
concern. In many Schools the Editor
is chosen by a St'llt)t)l-.\'l(lt‘ election
rather than by interest and ability.
One such school running) under this
system has not had a book out on
time since 1946. Keeping an ade-
quate and interested staff was an-
other problem. Most schools favored
a system of recognition titles for
everyone from a Senior to a fresh—
man with subordinated duties for
cacti.

In considering layout a member of
the faculty of the University of
Illinois School of Communications
pointed out that there are four big
elements to be considered 11 picture
material. ‘3) display type. 3t body
type and ~11 white space. Leading
national magazines serve as excel-
lent guides to effective layouts.

Discussions on the use of a theme
and copy in a yearbook proved tal-
uablc in pointing out that a theme
does not have to be triti and over—
worked btit can be carried tlirougii
by a certain shape picture or tini-
form views on divider pages. Copy
is needed in a book to complete the
story given by the photogriuihic
work.

l‘edagogue delegates left Detroit
with hopes of organizing a local
chapter of a national group of

Old News at Palace

There's a variation on an old
theme this week at the Palace.
'l‘hree Stripes in the Sun is the story
of the G1 who dislikes the Japanese

the GI. and Mitsuko Kiinura is
Madame Butterfly. They don't over
do it. so it shouldn‘t be too bad at
all.

will be a Soprano soloist too. This

Sara Jane Duffy '57 stated that

Activities Day will be an Activities
Week. During the summer a leaflet
concerning all organizations on cam-
pus will be sent, along with the
Handbook. to the prospective fresh;
the date of each group's’ reception
will also be listed. The Improvement
of Activities Committee also felt that
the prestige of the Campus Queen
could greatly be heightened by hav-
ing the Queen preside over several
other functions during the school
year.

AMIA"s inventory was presented
to Council by James Sweet '56. Much
of the equipment is either lost or
unaccounted for. It was explained
that both Frosh Camp and Rivalry
use this equipment besides the In-
tramural Groups and that. due to
the lumping together of State and
AMIA equipment, discrepancies have
occurred in the marking and check-
ing- out of equipment. A meeting
with President Collins to ask for
separate storage space for this equip-
ment is in the offing. It was felt that
immediate action had to be taken
so John Stefano '58 moved to freeze
the AMIA budget indefinitely. This
was passed by Council and will be
referred to Student Union Board of
Finance for their consideration.

Bruce King '56 reported that
three camps are n0\' zvailable—one
in the Warrensburg area, the sec-
ond near Glovei'sville and he third
in the vicinity of Lake Champlain.
King moved that Student Council
recommend to Student Association
that voting be done prior to Christ—
mas on the camu issue. A roll call
vote was taken and this was defeat-
ed. 16 to 4. A motion stating that
in the event Student Association did
decide to vote prior to the Christ-
lnas motion, that then Student
Couiicii would recommend the War-
rensburg Camp Motion be passed.
this was defeated. King then moved
that in the event SA does vote prior
to Christmas vacation. that then
Couiicii will recommend not pass-
ing the Warrensburg Camp Motion;
this “as passed.
