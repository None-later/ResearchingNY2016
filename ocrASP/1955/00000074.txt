STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. DECEMER 9. 1955

Sauersmen To Play 0

 

.../)eJ/)ao/de¢t...

by BOB KAMPF

Looking back on last year‘s dismal
two wins and sixteen defeats of the
1954-55 basketball squad. it is hard
to picture State having as bad a
record this year. With improve-
ments made in all departments, the
Peds have opened what looks to be .1
wining basketball season. State out-
scored their opponents by thirty-
three points this weekend, and only
missed having two wins by one
point. In last Friday's evenly
matched contest. State lost mainly
because the boys from RPI were a
little hot on the foul line. It's not
in every game that a team makes
72 per cent of their foul shots, but

Varsity Bowlers
Bow To Siena;

Drop To Fourth

State's varsity bowling team was
blanked for the second consecutive
time last Tuesday evening to fall
into fourth place in the Albany
District Inter-Collegiate Bowling
League. This week it was the Siena
Indians who waved the whitewash
brush over the locals. Again a Car-
pentier this time Dave who proved
to be the culprit as far as the
Statesmen were concerned. Last
week Paul Carpentier. brother ol'
Dave, of RPI. rolled a new high
single of 235 to set a new high for
the season and lead the Engineers
to a 5-0 win over State. This week
brother Dave clobbered the woods
for a sparkling 256 game to head the
attack of the Indians.

Lose By Few I‘ins

Despite losing all five points the
Peds had two respectable games
which they lost by only a few pins.
In the ﬁrst contest the local quintet
put together an 872 total. only to
lose out when Siena came up with
an 889 game. In the second en-
counter they slumped to 782 while
their opponents were racking up 884.
The ﬁnale, however. was the real
heartbreaker as the locals. led by
Joe Clement‘s 204. came up with an
854 game but were second best to
the Indians who had but eleven pins
more. 365. Siena captured the two
points for total pinnage. hitting
2578 to the Peds' 2518.

Wemple Leads

Anchorman Dick Weinple led the
attack of the luckleSs Statcsmcn
with a 540 triple on single game.» oi

tie '59 was right behind him with a

188, while Joc Clement (.‘illllC out
third with a 517 and captured high
single honors with 204 in thc linalc.

that's what RPI did Friday. State
made 62 per cent of its fouls. which
is nothing to laugh about. In Satur-
day's game, the Peds hit for 56 per
cent of tseir fouls, while New Paltz
could only manage to hit for 48 per
cent of their fouls, while New Paltz
was not that tight that fouls could
have made a difference. Another lin-
portant factor in the improvement
of State this year is the addition 01'
Gary Holway to the roster. In two
games, this boy scored 42 points. and
by the looks of things. he'l‘ ‘ ,- scor-
ing like that in future games.
Dempster’s Injury May Hurt

It's not only in the appearance of
Gary Holway that an improvement
has been shown, but the entire team
looks well organized on the court.
In the RPI game, Don Mayer, Jack
Minon. and Denny Dempster were
outstanding as was Holway. In Sat-
urday's game, John Rockwood. Lew
Carr. Sig Smith, and Holway were
outstanding, though all of the boys
played well. One thing that may
hurt the squad at this point is the
injury of the speedy playmaker.
Denny Deinpster. Denny‘s leg iii—
jury may kcep him off the squad for
six weeks. which means he will miss
at least ﬁve games. Coach Sauers i:
hoping he returns before six weeks.
ut that's one of the “break” of has-
kctball.

.2, Sauersmen Lose

neonta State Teachers Saturday

State Downs New Paltz 92-58,-
Gary Holway Scores 28 Points

By BOB KAMPF

Coach Sauers' hoopsters. having shown their power on their home
court, travel to the home courts of Harpur College and Oneonta State
Teachers College this week. (Last night. the Peds met Hartwick in the
Hartwick gym, but due to a Wednesday night deadline, it was impossible
to get any information on that game for this issue of the paper.) The
Sauersmen, having lost one game on the road, will be out to change
their road record for the better. as they meet Harpur at 7:30 tonight,
and Oneonta on Tuesday night at the same time in the Oneonta gym.

Last Saturday night in the Page
Hall gymnasium, the Peds walloped
the Hawks of New Paltz State
Teachers College by a score of 92-58.
From the opening moments of the
game. it was all Albany State. Gary
Holway. who wound up with 28
points at the end of the game, drop-
ped the ﬁrst two points of the game

Well. the basketball season just
got under way Friday. but from all
indications thus far it seems that
it will be a great year—something
new and different. The new blood
injected in the-team via the men-
torship position and a new face or
two on the squad Seems to have
brought about a favorable change.
Let’s' just hope our optimism is just-
ified. . . . We would like to extend
our apologies to Low Carr. whose
name was inadvertently left out of
last week's cage story. Lew, the '3

last year and Coach Sauers is ex-
pecting to employ him a lot this
season. . . . The school spirit display-
ed at Saturday night's game was
certainly a welcome relief from the
declining spirit displayed in the last
couple of years. Now that we have
a great team, along with the neces-
sary school spirit, perhaps more
steps will be taken to schedule
State's game somewhere other than
the Page bandbox. . . . By the way.
did you notice how cool the atinos~
phcrc got starting at the second
half? We'd swear one of the play-
ers seemed almost frozen. Yes,
many are cold but few are frozen.
. . . It's our sincerest hope that this
trial run of the eight page News is
put into practice in the near future.
If it becomes a reality. this depart-
ment will share in the expansion to
the tune of one page. This will give
us a greater opportunity to give you
