STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY. DECEMBER 9. 1955

supreme Court Outlaws Segregation
On Public Conveyance: In South

By DOMINIC DeCECCO

The Nation

Big news in the nation this week
is the recent Supreme Court ruling
regarding segregation. The Supreme
Court ruled that there shall be no
segregation on interstate travel on
twelve railroad companies, one rail
terminal company and one bus com-
pany. This ruling has been hailed
by segregationallsts as the begin-
ning of total segregation in the
South. The law does not affect all
parties practicing segregation, and
does not affect segregation in in-
trastate travel, however, this is one
of the most sweeping rulings issued
by the Supreme Court.

The prospects for an increase in
farm income are just about nil. Most
speculators agree that the farmer
is in for another bad year. Farm
income has dropped from 16 bil-
lion dollars in 1952 to an estimated
10 billion dollars in 1956. Most peo-
ple seem to disregard the plight of
the farmer since he does not begin
to holler until it really starts to
pinch.

Middle of the Road? ’

Moderation does not seem to be
the keynote of the Democratic plat-
form for 1956. Governor G. Mennen
(“Soapy”) Williams and Governor
Averell Harriman blasted a speech
made by Adlai Stevenson at the
Democratic National Committee
dinner in Chicago last week. Harri-
man came out with a powerful at-

How Do I Love Thee?

Love, Peace and Friendship seem
to be the key words in Russia's
woo-woo policy in the Far East.
Objects of her affection? India and
Afghanistan. This policy of big talk
—no wampum seems to work out
satisfactorily for Khrushchev and
00. People seem to appreciate these
spiritual offerings rather than our
material offerings. This has led to
the increase in U. S. participation
in various affairs held in these
countries. Our exhibits attract more
people than the Russian exhibits.
The Russians, who won’t admit de-
feat, have withdrawn from several
fairs when the United States has
announced its entry. This seems to
be a good field to work in.
