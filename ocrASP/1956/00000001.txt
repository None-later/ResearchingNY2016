Student Discloses Greek Temple
Hideaway Oi Women Bookies

By Alt'l‘ l’LO'l‘NlK

I don't know whether it was my
undying thirst for knowledge, a
wicked ii~srinnicni, or a lost \veck—
end that. brought, me to the State
library, btit. there i was. As I gaz—
cd like il country hick at. the iii-
spii'ing stairway and the 36 (li'cck
pillars, l iicvcr realized that the
future was dark and ominous Ac-
cordingly. I threw a snowball at it
brcnzc horscinaii and promcnadcd
thl‘oll‘ill .i swinging door.

1 saw no books upon cntcring. and
liccumc panicky anti frustrated. As
all ll't'h‘lllllt‘li know. irusii'iition
brings about motivation, and so I
inotivaicd up the iiciircst piilticiiil
siauway i spent about a half hour
in ihc ncxt rooiii i found. fascinated
by the inultitiulc ol' sliclvcs, with
rcatiing iniitcrial ncutly ptit away
in tll'ttWt‘i'ﬁ. i would have left in a
cold swcai upon i'ctili/iiig that this
was the card cataloguc. but I was
\\'t'iil‘llll, taps, and ii thousand cars
wci'c watching my every tnch with
uuilicc. I asked for the proprietor.

and was led to a book-shaped
woman.

"All right. where's the books?"

She threw me a frown that para-
lyzed my left side, and pointed to a
pile of cards. I read them. and
angrily told her that her books were
too short, repetitious. and had inis-
crablc plots. She showed her fangs,
an:i growled something about re-
quest cards. I staggered back to
them.

By this time I had figured out
the rocket. I filled out the cards and
dealt. tiiciii to her . five-card
draw with dcuces wild. She picked
up her hand and went to a back
room. after sending me to ll tavern-
likc table. I was about to ask for
a menu. when she returned with,
of all things, a book.

i tbumbvd through it, and since
it was neither Mickey Spillane nor
:cicncc-liction. I quit the scene with-
out leaving a tip.

1 swung through the spherical
doorway. threw a snowball at a
brouzo horseman, and went home.
