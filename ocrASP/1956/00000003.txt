.up. An actuary is a person who cai-

culates the probabilities of loss on in-

surance and what insurance com-
panies should charge for assuming

certain risks. They also collect and

analyze data for the company, and
attempt to determine means of re-
ducing losses in the company. A
knowledge of business methods
Would also be extremely helpful.
Most actuaries are employed directly

camp issue. The ballot will read: “I

The following information on the
three camps investigated by Student
Association has been compiled by
Bruce King ’56, Chairman of the
Surplus Committee:

The ﬁrst site is near Warrensburg,
approximately 80 miles from Albany.
and is priced at $10,000. The 700 acre
site features one small beaver pond,
the size of which is about one-half
mile by three-eights of a mile. Ana-
tural horse-shoe shaped ridge sur-
rounds the pond, with the open end
facing the Hudson River. At present
there is one building on the land, a
farm building. The structure could

provide temporary shelter for small
groups until other buildings are
constructed. A deﬁnite advantage is
that the lake is entirely within the
proposed property lines, which would
give the college exolusive rights to
the body of water. This proposed
site is accessible to winter sports
regions.

The second available site is 65
miles from Albany, in the region
northwest of Gloversville. The quot-
ed price is $4,000 for approximately
1,000 acres of land. There are three
lakes partially included in the
wooded area. One cabin and one
barn are the only structures on the
site. The chief body of water, Irv-
ing Pond, has several other owners
on its shore front. The water level
of the large lake ﬂuctuates at times
frcm 10 to 15 feet because of the
operation of a power dam on the
southwest end of the lake. The only
road leading to the property is on
another tract of land. To reach the
proposed site, one must either go
around the entire lake, go by boat.
or travel through a pathless brush
area. The two buildings now stand-
ing could provide temporary shelter
for the small groups.

The third site is located on Lake
Champlain, southwest of Burling-
ton. Vermont. This site, approxi-
mately 142 miles from Albany, is
the most highly developed area of
the three. The price for the 15 acre
tract is $65,000. Natural features in—
clude a wooded area on a sand
beach fronting on Lake Champlain.
Buildings include a sizeable recrea-
tion hall and dining hall with ex—
cellent kitchen facilities. The dining
hall accommodates 125 people. The
hall is pine panelled with a glass
exterior. There are 16 cabins hous-
ing 75 people. Each cabin has a pic—
ture window and a private bath.
The physical plant also includes a
sewage disposal system (septic
tankSi, hot and cold water and
electricity. One cabin is insulated
for winter. Furniture and equipment
are included in the sale of the
house. There are ample facilities for
all sports.

On Current

Freshman Class

(Continued from Page 3, Column 2)
1945. At that time, the Class of ’48
showed about the same degree of
superiority when compared with

their contemporaries as did the
Class of '57.
There is fairly general agree-

ment that the New York State Re-
gents Scholarship Examinations are
a good index of aptitude for college
work. Your writer has, more than
once, heard the Dean or President
of a private college boast about the
number of “State Scholarship" win-
ners in his student body. The data
on the number of State Scholar-
ship holders enrolled in each of the
colleges in New York State are not
available. However, I doubt that
there are many student bodies in
New York State that have as high
a proportion of Regents Scholar-
ship winners as our own. The
Class of ’58, on entering college,
contained 7.7% Regents Scholar-
ship holders. Throughout all the
colleges in New York State that
fail, the average freshman class
contained 3.3% Regents Scholar-
ship winners. About 20% of the
State College Class of ‘59 are Re-
gents Scholarship winners. The fig-
ure on the statewide average is not
available, since total freshman en-
rollment is not yet available. My
own guess is that 6"} of all fresh-
men in the State are State Schol-
arship holders. I’I‘he number of
scholarships awarded was doubled,
effective September, 1955).

These facts and others all attest
to the quality of our student body
as a whole. They also suggest that
there has been no lowering of
standards for admissions, even
though in September, 1955, the Col-
lege enrolled almost twice as many
freshmen as it did ten years ago.
As to whether or not these entrance
standards are maintained, or rais—
ed. in future years depends to a
great extent upon the interest you
take in your college after you grad-
unte.

By ZACH CLEMENTS

On December 9, of the anno just
completed the State College wrest-
ling team defeated a brawny Brook-
lyn Tech aggregation by a score
of 28-13. The Garciamen were pac-
ed by Dave Goldberg, Ed Weaver,
Ozzie Leahy, Bill Gropp and Wayne

On the losing end was Burt

On Thursday, December 15, B.V.
(before vacation) the matinen ex-
tended their undefeated season by
handing their arch rivals. the en-
gineers of R.P.I., a 22-17 setback at
Page gym. The Statesmen who seem
victory hungry went into this match
and displayed some wonderful tal-
ent as well as fine team spirit and
optimists are beginning to predict
an undefeated season for the grap—
piers.

Wayne Harvey, Dave Goldberg,
and Ozzie Leahy all extended their
undefeated season by pinning their
opponents. Also winning his match
was Burt Rounds who returned to
the winning ways while Don Bind-
rum was held to a draw in his
match. Pinned by their opponents
were Statesmen Ed Weaver, and
Bill Gropp. Ronnie Novak, wrestling
in place of the injured Bob Bosom-
worth, was also defeated.

During the Christmas vacation
Wayne Harvey traveled to Wilkes
College, located in Wilkes-Barre,
Penn., where he participated in the
Open Wrestling Championships.
Wayne. using his own funds, wrest-
led against boys from schools like
Michigan State, M.I.T., and Pitt.

F‘oui shooting has not made a great
difference this year, since State
holds a average of 58.6% of their
fouls made and their opponents
have an average of 58.5% By look-

valid excuse for the current medi-
ocre record of 2-3.

Barring injury, things look pret-
ty good for the Fed's in '56.
Gary Holway has hit the cords
for a 19.4 average, and Sig Smith
has a 14 point average. Don
Mayer is showing what was expected
of him last year, and has become
an important link in the varsity or-
ganization, especially since Lew
Carr has left the team. Big Don
will have a bigger job now, especially
underneath the backboards. Denny
Dempster is expected to return soon,
and assist the team in its effort to
have a winning season. John Rook-
wood, Jack Minon and Joe Anderson
have all been steady, and the Peds
should be able to Jump into the win
column right at the start. See you
at the New Haven game tomorrow
night. Let‘s cheer the Feds on as
they go after a winning season.

Before leaving for vacation, the
Feds varsity basketball squad went
on the road for three games, and
