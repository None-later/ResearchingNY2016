STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. JANUARY 6. 1956

Nationalist Veto \Y/ealcensI

Their Position in Security Council

By DOMINIC DeCECCO

The Nation . . .

A recent editorial in the Journal
American reveals that inside sources
predict that Eisenhower will run in
1956. We still stick to our guns and
say he will decline the nomination.
Republicans of course cannot start
politicking until Ike makes his de-
cision.

Democrats are confident of win-
ning majorities in both houses of
Congress because they have fewer
seats in contest in the Senate (15
with 7 in the Solid South) and can
lose some seats in the House and
still retain control. Adlai Steven-
son has started his band wagon
rolling and seems to be leaving the
other Democratic hopefuls far be-
hind. Harriman is finding it quite
hard to convince other Democrats
about his qualifications. Kefauver
got off to a slow start and is still
lagging to lack of financial support.
Considerable mention has been giv-
en to Ohio's Governor Frank Lau-
sche as a possible dark horse can-
didate.

Communism . . .

For all those interested in Com-
munism in the United States, the
U. S. News and World Report has
an excellent article entitled “A
Handbook for Americans, How to
Detect the Activities of the Com-
munists in the U. S." The article
is taken from a report issued by the
Senate Internal Security Subcom-
mittee on “The Communist Party
of the United States of America."
The article is well written and very
revealing. Should be a must for all
students.

The World . . .

We were very much relieved to
find that the United Nations had
not lost some of its sense of uni-
versality when they admitted 16
new members to up the total mem-
bership from 60 to '76. Considerable
opposition was given by the
USSR. and Nationalist China.
China vetoed the bill because it
objected to the admittance of Out-
er Mongolia and then Russia pro-

Carlson Spealcs
On Education

Speaking at the recent Conference
on Higher Education in New York
State at Rensselaer Polytechnic Iii-
stltute, Troy, on December 9. Presi-
dent William S. Carlson of the State
University of New York said that
New York State's support of higher
education lags.

“Any analysis" he explained.
“makes clear that New York is well
below the national average in its
support of higher education in pro-
portion to per capita income of
its people. . . . "

As a by-product. President Carlson
said. 10,000 more undergraduates
leave New York each year than
come in to attend public colleges.
He warned that pressure of grow-
ing population would force many of
the out-of-state schools to turn
away New Yorkers, thus increasing
the burden in the State.

President Carlson reported that
Education Department estimates iii-
dicate that by 1970 the number of
high school graduates in the state
would rise from the present 110,000
a year to 230.000.

iiounccs that Forum of Politics is

the students of State College on
Monday at 4 pm. at Brubiichci' Hall

Nationalist China. lost considerable
prestige when it vetoed the admit-
tance of Outer Mongolia because
in 1945 it recognized the sovereignty
of Outer Mongolia. China’s seat on
the Security Council was also jeo-
pardized because many U.N. coun-
tries question whether China really
represents the Chinese people or
ust Formosa. Russia now has a
good talking point for the admit-
tance of the People’s Republic of
China.

MILD, YE T THEY 5/

By ANN

A Kansas State College student
did a little digging and came up
with these Shakespearean comments
on college life:

Studying in the library: “More
lights, you knaves; and trap the
tables up, and quench the fire, the
room is grown too hot.” Romeo and
Juliet.

Cramming at 7 am: “It is not
for your health thus to commit
your weak condition to the raw cold
morning.” Julius Caesar.

Fountain pen leaked: “Out damn—
ed spot! Out. I say!” Macbeth.

(from the Indiana Penn)

Also from the Indiana Penn is
the following: “Girls are like news-
papers: They have forms, they al-
ways have the last word. back num-
bers are not in demand. they have
great influence, you can't believe
everything they say, They’re thin-
ner than they used to be, they get
along by advertising, and every man
should have his own and not try
to borrow his neighbor's."

A few definitions found in the
Daily Californian and reprinted in
the Reflector of New Jersey State
Teachers College are:

Cramming—The desperate hours.

Cut—Being where your class isn’t
when it is.

Finals—Hell week at the wrong
end of the semester.

Some advice for those with a
heavy foot on the .gas pedal from
the Xavier University News.

“Sing While You Drive"
At 45 miles per hour, sing;

“Highways are happy ways."
At 55 miles per hour. sing:

“I’m but a stranger here."

At 65 miles per hour, sing:

“Nearer my God, to Thee."

At ’75 miles per hour, sing:

“When the roll is called up won-

der. I’ll be there."

At 85 miles per hour, sing:

“Lord, I'm coming home."

A Kansas State professor suim-
marizes the difference between a
college student and a high school
student in this way:

“When you walk into a high
school class and say ‘good morn-
ing’, the students reply ‘good
morning.’ But when you walk into
a college class and say ‘Good
morning', the students write it
down.

Hurley Spealss
For NAACP

Students and faculty members
have been invited by the Albany
chapter of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored
People to hear a lecture by Mrs.
Ruby Hurley on Sunday at 3 pm.
in Friendship House of the First
Lutheran Church, 181 Western
Avenue. Mrs. Hurley is Southeast
Regional Director of the NAACP,
with headquarters in Birmingham,
Alabama. Admission is free.

The speaker will report on the
successful integration of schools in
her hometown of Washington, D. C.
When Emmett Till was murdered in
Mississippi last summer, Ruby Hur-
ley was sent by the National Office
to investigate the facts of the case.
When the White Citizen’s Councils
organized to prevent the integra-
tion of schools and to intimidate
Negroes through mob violence and
economic pressure, Mrs. Hurley was
sent to give advice and to mobilize
support for the NAACP branches
under attack.

As I leave my desk, having edited the 40th volume of
the State College News, and turn my “editorial ruler” over
to you, the Co—Editor of the 4151; volume, I relinquish one
of the most satisfying, yet at the same time, terrifying jobs
in the extra-curricular field. It is a job full of responsi—
bilities to the students, the administration, the traditions
of the News and to yourselves.

As the only organized means of communication on
campus the News is dedicated to conveying the truth to

the students, no matter how it hurts.

It is numbered

in the minority among college newspapers in this country
in that it is solely a student-organized, student-edited,

student-censored newspaper.

Always be proud of this and

never dishonor it in any way.

You will find many new friends and many more ene—
mies; you will be pressured by groups and individuals
trying to gain their own ends without consideration of
Student Association; you will think, sometimes, that you
have reached the darkest depths and will never arise again.
At times you may think it's not worth the time, energy,
worry, tears, and sacrifice that go into it, but looking
back on your 26 issues you won't regret one minute of it
and will wish it was just beginning again.

In 40 years the News has never violated one tradition
which stands far above the i‘est—-“The News always comes
out on Friday" and as long as there are students like the
ones on the staff this past year, this tradition never will

be violated.

For standing by me this past year and giving me ad—
vice and encouragement, I owe many thanks to the News
Board; secondly, for their criticism, understanding and
commendation I thank the Administration; thirdly, I am
graiwful to the printers and publishers of the iiudson
Register-Star for their patience and cooperation in our ef—

forts to meet the deadline;

and fourthly, my heart—felt

thanks to my staff who have been wonderful and have

never let me down.

Something I shall ncvci'
on; you get when the paper

forgot is that wonderful fccl-
comcs off the press and you

ran point with pride and say—“I hclpcd to produce that.”
l sincci'cly hope, Marcia and Toni, that you have as nice

a year as I havc had.
