A Tribute . . .

With this week’s issue of the News we
mark the end of the editorshi of Aileen
Cochrane. The News Board an Staff have
been roud to be your associates.

Un er your leadership the State College
News has initiated the eight-page issue and
increased its feature space. The entire stu-
dent body has been guided by your force-
ful editorials.

Those who have worked in the Publica-
tions Office with you, Aileen, have admired
your firm decisions and efficient com-
mands. You have devoted much time and
energy to our school paper. We, the NEWS
Board and Staff, 1955-56, thank you.

Extortion?

If you were the custodian of $10,000 and
it was your responsibility to care for it and
see that it was s ent wisely, would you let
someone else ma e the decision on its dis-
posal without your approval? Of course not.
but that is just what you are doing, all 1700
of you who have not yet cast your ballot on
the purchase of a college camp. While it is
not perhaps your money alone, other classes
in past years have placed you in charge of
it and expect you to consider carefully be-
fore letting it go.

Vote either way, “yes” or “no,” but for
heaven’s sake VOTEH It is your responSI-
bility to help make the decision, not Just
your neighbor’s. You won’t be sorry later
if you act now!

A New Proposal . . .

Student Council endorsed the new revis-
ed budget procedure as presented by Stu-
dent Board of Finance Wednesday night.
As we see it, this plan, while eliminating
budget discussions by Council, still permits
the long, drawn-out budget Assemblies
where SA goes over each individual line,
wasting valuable time.

We feel that while this is perhaps a step
in the right direction, there could be a bet-
ter, more efficient system devised.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. JANUARY 13.

A Last Look . . .

A few years back the retiring editor of
the News spoke these words: “It is very
easy when leaving a place, to look back, re-
member the pleasant experiences and say
that it has been four good years . . . (but)

. . while looking at the past and judging
its value, it is better sense to point out the
weaknesses of State College and its people."

As a retiring Editor, we also look back
and see the one weakness standing above
the rest; one, perhaps, of which we are least
aware, and that is, the emphasis placed
upon the group rather than the person.
State College places a great value on be—
longing to a group and prides itself on the
feeling of “brotherhood” and broadminded-
ness concerning these groups. The liberal-
ness and broadmindedness viewed on the
outside turns into prejudice and narrow—
mindedness when the group is viewed from
the inside.

Individualism is feared and frowned upon
to such a degree that anyone attempting to
exercise it is immediately ostracized and
ridiculed. For educated college people train—
ing to be teachers, a profession puthized
as one of the most tolerant, we are not ex-
ercising the intelligence attributed to us
which caused us to be designated as the
“cream of the crop.” ‘ .

A person who dares voice an opinion con-
trary to that held by the grouplis immedi-
ately labelled a “radical,” and is given no
chance to explain his Opinion or how he
arrived at it. Some of these “radicals” have
insight into our problems and can see a
remedy, but the moment they dare to sug-
gest one, they are “persecuting the group
unjustly" and “trying to stir up trouble._
To say they and their work are unapprec1—
ated is the understatement of the year, yet
their ideas are often the ones taken, fol—
lowed and acclaimed, but their origin is
never admitted. .

We are not condemning this “Hi, gang!“
feeling so prevalent at State College, but
are calling for a little more tolerance, un—
derstanding and true broadmindedness on
the part of the students, who are soon to be
admired and respected as shining examples
of adulthood, by the next generation.

A Social Problem Finds its Way To The Curriculum

A prominent economist has stat-
ed that increased automation in
American industry will bring about
social changes at least as great as
those wrought by the Industrial
Revolution. Whether or not this is
true has little bearing on this arti-
cle. but it indicates that we are
on the threshhold of an era of pro-
found changes ln our cultural pat-
terns.

What is perhaps one of the most
significant changes, one that is al-
ready under way is the increase in
the amount of leisure time avail-
able to the individual.

The merit of this movement can-
not be judged in and of itself. An
abstract fact like a given number
of free hours per week takes on
value only when we consider how

these hours are spent. And even
now the observer can note that the
use of leisure is not of such nature
to encourage a great deal of optim-
ism.

Criticism of television, motion pic-
tures and the effects of the auto-
mobile is deep and far-reaching.
Yet by and large, it is exactly these
things that are used to while away
the free hours. They all instill in
the individual a dulled and warped
sense of values. The “happy little
home" and anemic love stories of
the great majority of movies and
television productions are not de-
sigiied to provide intellectual clini-
ienge. The automobile has done
more to disrupt traditional Ameri-
can values than evcry social critic

Mencken. John Doe's fond boast is
that his car can travel faster, more
comfortably and with greater show
of wealth than his neighbor's.
While his car is probably among
the best in the world, he often loses
sight of where it has taken him or
what he has inlssed. iNotice. for
instance. the desecration of the
Adirondack Mountains with coni—
mercial fools' paraciises.i

A logical solution to this problem
can be found in the writings of
those who tried to justify the worst
excesses of early industrialination.
If leisure time is not beliig used
wisely. take away the leisure time.
Let a man spend his every waking
moment producing goods.

I‘he one hole in this solution is
simply that in (icing so, the man
ceases to become a man; he is born,
lives, begets and dies an economic
unit, nothing more. But man was

abstract thought and crcathc re-
creation. By not, inking part in
both, he i'cnoiinccs his humanity.

A more satisfying solution lies
in education, As it stands education
has prepared nearly everyone to be
able to take part in his society only
as a producer; it has sadly neglect-
ed the vital leisure. in order to in—
sure a better use of this leisure,
education on all levels must take

CLEMENTS

Coach Garcia's boys are still un-
defeated and this win was the most
impressive of the season. This shOWS
that the grapplers are steadily im-
proving and could really give any
team a good match.

Harvey Leads way

The Fed attack was aced
Wayne Harvey who has pextendzd’
his undefeated season to three
straight pins. Wayne, who is the
lightest man on the State squad has
yet to be beaten since wrestling at
State College. Dave Goldberg who
is also undefeated this season, de-
feated his opponent while garnering
three points for the Fed cause. Oz-
zie Leahy rounds out the list of the
iindefeated by defeating his oppo-
nent, 3~0. Don Bindrum, who in his
last outing was held to a draw de-
feated his opponent by a 3-0 margin.

Big Ed Weaver. the freshman
standout. really rose to the occasion
by thoroughly defeating his man
and putting ﬁve poliits 1n the bank
for the Feds. Mike Newman, in his
ﬁrst outing for the Statesmen, won
over his opponent by a 3-0 score.

Gropp Hurt

By this time the Feds appeared
certain to sweep the match since
they were winning by a 25-0 margin
and their heavyweight ace, B111
Gropp, was scheduled to wrestle 1n
the cloaln: bout. In the middle of
illi' coiilyvsi, however. Bill sustained
ll liiiil'li'llil‘fi elbow and was forced
to [‘1'111‘1' thereby giving the Engi-
iii:ci':; Illi'll' only score of the day.
Vli'lll was liikcn to a hospital and
his lil'lll put in 11 cast. He is well
on the way 10 recovcrv but it not
exported to return tlils season.
C(iilf‘il (iiii‘clu feels that Bill's loss
will illll‘i the train as far as the
heavyweight class and the general
balance of the team is concerned.

Couch Garcia has asked this re-
poi'tci‘ to issue another call for
wrestlers since the team at present
is lacking in depth and badly in
need of men. If any man has had
wrestling cxpcricncc he is urng to
get in touch with Coach Garcia and
to get in on the wrestling program.
