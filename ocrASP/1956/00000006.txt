Tuesday night, as the Sauersmen
tasted victory after losing three
straight games. State capitalized on
Danbury's lack of vertical altitude,

102—61. The victory for the Feds was
their third in eight starts. Danbury
has yet to see the light of a victroy,

No sooner had the game begun
when Joe Anderson dunked a jump

State moved out front with a 7-1

minutes of play, and their State
pulled the carpet out from under the
Danbury squad, and begun hitting
from all angles. When the half
ended and the dust had cleared out
of the Danbury's Five's eyes. the
scoreboard read, State 54, Danbury

The Pcds slowed down a bit in the
second half. but not for long. John
Rookwood duncked in four fouls.
and Holway hit for seven more
points before the half was seven
minutes old. Danbury showed a
little more life at the start of the
half. and Karcheski dropped six
points through the hoop to keep
Danbury alive. However, life wasn't
worth living for the Danbury squad,
as State moved toward the Century
mark. John Rookwood fouled out
early but not before entering the

the sunny side of filial score ﬁgures. double ﬁgures with ten points.

Holway Hits Record

State fans found something to
really cheer about in the closing
eight minutes as Gary Holway head-
ed for Bill Walker's and John
Centre’s record of 30 points by a
State player in Page Gym. When
Gary arrived at 30, he kept going
until he reached 33, one short of the
State record held by Si Feisl who
scored 34 in an away game in the
‘48—'49 season. Coach Sauers saw
it in his heart to give the Danbury
boys a break, and pulled Gary from
the game. Dick Causey replaced him
and garnished eight points himself.
With a secondary squad on the
court, State hit the century mark for
the ﬁrst time this year. Everyone on
the squad scored. The Feds hit for
24 of 38 fouls, and Danbury hit for
50% of theirs. 25 of 50. It was cer-
tainly a team victory for the Pads,
who are now out to stop a rumored
good Plattsburg squad, tomorrow
night in Page Gym after the 7 pm.
preliminary game. Next week end
it will be Pace on Friday night in
Page. and New Paltz away on Satur-
day night. After these games, the
Feds take a break for the ﬁnals, and
won‘t see action again until Febru-
ary 3.
