Students To Pay SBF Announces Budget Revision,

By    esRegistration for the second scan-

By DAVID KENDIG ’57

There are a large number of con-
servatives still in the United States,
despite many prevailing opinions to
the contrary. They manifest them-
selves in highly respected organ-
izations, such as the American Bar
Association, the American Legion.
and various other patriotic groups,
including the Daughters of the Ani-
erican Revolution, the Colonial
Dairies, etc._ Their publications have
a fairly large circulation, such as
Facts Forum. National Review, and
the Hearst papers. The conserva-
tives are rightly concerned with pa-
triotism. the legislative influence in
national affairs, foreign aid and
other topics of interest to all Am-
ericans. Their spokesmen have
ranged all the way from such re-
spected Americans as former Presi-
dent Herbert Hoover, and the late
Senator Taft. to men like Senator
McCarthy, and Gov, J. Bracken Lee
of Utah. Unfortunately. the conser-
vatives. much as the liberals and
ultra-communists, have allowed
themselves to be used by some very
peculiar individuals, and it is the
purpose of this column, in its con—
cluding issue to discuss one of them
in some detail. '

Joseph Kamp is listed as the di-

rector of The Constitutional Edu-
cation League, with headquarters
at Madison Avenue, in the Canadian
Railways Bldg, in New York. In
a musty office, on the eighth floor,
Kamp pursues an interesting occu-
pation of grinding out hate, and
misrepresentation on almost any
subject you can name.
‘I-Iis central thesis is that the
United States is being undermined
by» a Jewish Gestapo, namely the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B’rith. They not only captured coii—
troi under the administrations of
Roosevelt and Truman, Kamp
states, they aLso run Eisenhower
and have for some time. The Consti-
tutional Education League supported
,Taft in 1952, but do not presume to
think Taft supported them. -in fact
he repudiated the organization.
Taft, during this time. was captiv-
lated by the Jews, too. An example
2of propaganda disseminated during
the Eisenhower campaign, was a
newsletter bearing the headline
“Moscow Tells Eisenhower.” Kamp
hastens to explain, (in small print»
in a later issue that by Moscow, he
meant Warren Moscow, a reporter.
He says he was only "kidding." I
think the illustration will prove
helpful.

A series of articles appeared about
Kamp in the New York World-Tele-
gram by Fred Woltman, a Pulitzer-
prize recipient for his articles es-
posing Communism. Kamp retali-
ated with a pamphlet on Woltman,
whom he affectionately calls “Rt-d
Fred."

Kamp lately has served as the
head of the Committee for McCar-
thyism, which rallied the support
of innocent conservatives to McCar-
thy's side, during the Senator‘s re-
cent investigations. And the prize
is his latest pamphlet on The Ain-
erican Bar Association and the
Ford Foundation. In this. he sets
forth the profound thesis that if you
buy a Ford automobile, you are
helping the Communist cause.

Kamp’s ravings might be dismiss-
ed as mere bigotry, and in our most
charitable views, as illogical reason-
ing, except that his influence is
astounding. Kemp's publications
played an important role in thl‘
Congressional Investigations on
foundations, when B. Carroll Reece
allowed himself to be influenced,
to a great deal. by them. And at
the recent American Legion Con-
vention, his publications on Uiicsco,
undoubtedly influenced the result-
ing vote against the organization.

Kamp is, of course, anti-Commu—
nist. In fact, he tells you that he
has been lighting Communism
longer, and earlier than any other
man in America. He has also done
it good job fighting Congressional
Committees who have asked him
for lists of his members, which he
refuses to divulge. Kunip was sev-
eral times cotcd for contempt of
Congress. All of which loads us to
bemoan those conservatives, who in
their quest for uiidoubtably carncst
reform in government, contribute
inoiicy to, or take the advice printed
in his "Headlines and What's Be-

hind Them."

Hart's current campaign is to
get the United Nations off Ameri—
can soil. In order to pursue this
objective, and similar “economic
aims" he has joined up with the
proposed nation wide Anti-Negro,
Pro-Segregation organization re-
cently founded in the South. There
are many, many more like Kninp
and Hart, who through their preach-
ing of “second class citizenry,” and
un-American garbage, constitute a
grave threat that we often overlook
in our concern for the Communists.
Their influence is extreme, and
anyone who doubts it might find it
interesting to study their effect on
the present Governor of Utah.

Unfortunately. the only thing
that is worse than liberals, duped by
“Communists,” to this writer is the
tragic story now going on of con—
servatives being duped by “Fascists”
who are quite profitably, undermin-
ing our country,

ter will continue through Tuesday
states Edward Sabol, Coordinator
of Field Services. Everyone is ask-
ed to adhere to the schedule so that
the entire process may be expedited
quickly and efficiently.

Sheets For Workers

The sign-up sheet for crews for
the Ali-College Revue is now posted
on the Revue bulletin board in the

Ginsburg '56, Technical Director.

Anyone interested in constructing
sets or working on props, lights, cos-
tumes. make-up, publicity, ushering,

Student Council at their meeting
Wednesday discussed the following
two plans for a revised budget pro—
cedurc and voted to recommend the
passing of the first plan by Student
Association. The plan was amended
to read that three members of
Council form the committee meet-
ing with Student Board of Finance.
Student Association would not be
able to vote on the budget as a
whole, but would be able to discuss
the separate lines and move to ac—
cept or reject individual lines by a
two—thirds vote after it had been
to Student Board of Finance.

The main essence of the first
plan is to alleviate the Student
Council step in order to avoid rep—
etitious work and save time. Bud—
gets will be presented to SBF for
review. For this budget period 3 or
4 non-voting members of Student
Council would be appointed to sit
in and review the budgets also, Only
those points which were considered
controversial by SC representatives

t Council Action

would be referred to Student Coun-
cil. The budgets which SBF passed
would be considered final. They
would then be presented to Student
Association for approval. Changes
could be made by Student Associa-
tion only by a two-thirds vote.

The second plan aims to cut out
Student Council altogether. Budgets
would be presented to SBF for re-
view and would be reviewed by Stu—
dent Association in open hearings
at which time anyone could ques-
tion, uphold, suggest changes and
justify the budgets. Student Board
of Finance, after deliberating this
testimonial would take action on
the individual budgets. The budgets
would then be presented to Student
Association for final approval. They
would vote only for total individual
budgets «for example SC $900).
They would not be allowed to change
lines within a budget at this time.
That would be the purpose of open
hearings.
