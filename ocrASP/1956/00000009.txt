In an effort to clear up some of
the misunderstandings on the part
of the students about the Adminis-
tration’s policy regarding Admis-
sions to this college and Probation,
Dr. Evan R. Collins, President of
the College, and Oscar E. Lanford,
Dean of the College, have been
contacted and interviewed with the
following results.

Mr. Arthur Jones. Director of Ad-
missions, is the only person who
interviews prospective freshmen
and who determines whether or not
they shall be admitted. The ad-
missions requirements. set by the
Faculty and followed by Jones, use
the following materials and sources:
recommendations of High School
people, test scores from Intelligence
and Reading tests given in high
schools, and Selective Admissions
Exams given throughout the coun-
try, high school averages and extra-
curricular activities. Scores of en-
tering freshmen who have taken the
Selective Admissions exams are
compared with national averages
for liberal arts schools.

The number of entering freshmen
increases with each year. and more
and more people leave school. Last
year, out of 2300 applications. 563
freshmen were accepted. After the
first semester 190 students left col-
lege, for one reason or another. Of
those 190 approximately 40 complet—
ed degree requirements in January.
New students and transfers number
95 for this semester.

The reasons for this increase in
enrollment is due to the increase
in population. there being one net
addition to the population every
twelve seconds. New York State
boasts ten per cent of the popula-
tion of the United States, and twelve
per cent of the country's college
population. There is no set quota
for each September's admissions,
because of various factors includ-
ing: need for teachers, capacity of
buildings, facilities, money, size of
faculty. At present the faculty is
considering the size of enrollments

When classes are through
And your girl’s close to you
Here’s a good thing to do—have a CAMEL!

for the next ten years and estim-
ates that ln order to take care of
the number of people in college
by 1970 the college teaching staff
will have to be doubled. In an at-
tempt to meet the needs of the
elementary and secondary schools
who are crying for teachers, a larg—
er group of freshmen is being ad-
mitted each year. For the past few
years they have been taken from
a smaller group of applicants as
compared with former years, yet
the level of perfunnance of each
group admitted has been higher
than the preceding year.

In order to accept more than we
are, presently, a building program
has to be devised to accommodate
more students and increases in the
size of the faculty. facilities and
budget have to accompany it.

There is no set procedure or set
standards by which a student may
be Judged to be on probation. A
student may be placed on probation
at any time that his work is not
satisfactory in any course. This may
be judged in various ways: all the
factors known about students are
taken into consideration and if cir-
cumstances are such. that probation
is deemed umvarronted by the
Dean, 1.0. sueh as in the case of
illness of the student, he is per-
mittcd to continue in college. not
on probation. However if there are
no logical reasons for his academic
shortcomings. the person in question
may be put on probation. People
are required to maintain 124 hours
of a “C” average over four years.
Anyone falling behind at any time
may be placed on probation. at the
discretion of the Dean and the
Faculty Committee on Academic
tanding. This committee submits
rules governing probation, approved
by the Academic Council, to the
Dean who sees they are enforced.

There is no such thing as double
or triple probation. Students may
be placed on probation and carried
on for anonther semester but rare—
ly after that.

Pratt ln Weekend Trip

By non

Losing absolutely none of its win-
ning ability, and gaining its ace
playmaker. the State hoop squad
came back after a two week lay off
Friday night to wallop Oswego State
for its third straight victory and
sixth of the year, 94-64. Tonight,
the Feds traVel to Long Island in
order to try to master a slightly
favored Pratt Institute five. Tomor-
row, the Sauersmen will cross the
state line and move into Connecti-
cut territory to exchange baskets
with the New Haven Teachers.
Wednesday, the Purple and Gold
squad will be back in Page to meet
Hillyer. The game will follow the
7 o‘clock J.V. preliminary.

BALLHAWK RETURNS. Pictured

above is Denny Dempster, State’s
ace playmakcr who returned to ac-
tion after recovering from his leg
injury.

KAMPF

The Oswego game had an addi-
tional flavor added to it, in that
Denny Dempster, ball hawk A-l, re-
turned to the Purple and Gold line
up.
As for the game, State fans felt
somewhat discontented in the first
half, as the Zielmen. paced by Har-
meling and Collis, jumped off to
a 12-2 lead. The Peds didn't let
them down for long, and came back
to knot the count at 15 all. They
commenced to stampede the Oswe-
go basket. and hurled thirty-five
points into the scorebook, while
Oswego could garnish but seven. For
a span of three and a half min-
utes, the Zielmen failed to score.
Led by Sig Smith, Don Mayer. and
Jumping Joe Anderson. the home
team doubled Oswego's score, 38-19.
The State guns ceased for a mo-
ment at this point. and the Oswego
five galloped up to within eleven
points of the Sauersmen. as the
half ended with State ahead, 41-30.
Ilolway Scores 26 in 2nd Half

One unfamiliar feature of the
first half was that Gary Holway.
who averages twenty-three points
a game these days, was held to a
low four points. However. he em-
erged from his cone in the second
half, and began dunking shots in
from all angles under the back-
boards. and wound up with a double
figured thirty points.
