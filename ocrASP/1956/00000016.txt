- - Anxious Probes

"To Stay Or

 

The Albany Stained students
have been kicking (see picture on
left . tired feet) about the long
delay on probation decisions by the
Academic Council. Savage mobs-
have been pacing the registrar's of-
fice for almost, a month now. wear—
ing iaps and smoking reefers just
for spite isec picture at left i
reefers on floori.

thn Dian Lampoon was ill-
formcd that the students wet" abou:
to revolt. he stated. “These stit-
dents have always been revolting."

Thcrc were approximately 1.200
students on probation packed into
the tiny room. until D‘an Harllcss
used a flame throwcr to keep things
moving. This act burned up several
probationers. who rctalliated with
hand grcnadcs and chlorine gas. in
spite of all the confusion, ihc Coun~
cil fearlessly contimtcd to siick pins
in wax imagcs of the probes.

Fcbrniry 12. an epidemic of ath-
lete's foot broke out iscc picture at.

result of this. the grapes wcrc tak-
en off the floor. and wine-making
was forbidden for three days [see
picture at left no grapesi.

February 16. ihe first student
was admitted to conference. After
having his student tax ticket and
his face punched several times, he
managed to win 68 ccnts in black—
jack. He was given a choice of re-
turning the money or flanking out
of college. Hc chose to kccp the
loot. whcrcupon hc instantly i'cll
through a trap door. ‘

The next student had no moncv
to offer for bribes. but he gladli
sold 6.000 dollars worth of ihc
ctiuipincnt hc had stolcn from
A.M.i,A. lll ordcr to stay in college.
The student. Davc Shindig. rcqucsi-
cd that we withhold his name be-
causc of ill h -alth.

By February 120. the Council had
taken carc of 840 studciiis‘ . .
with machine guns. The othcr
probes. starving from 20 days oi
captivity. fought viciously for ihc
inorc succulent portions of the fresh
bodics.

As. ihc situation bccamc morc of

his little black book and looked at
the Dean's list. . . . Betty. AL 2-0002

In spite of the riot this list cre—
ated. Dean Lampoon decided to call
out the true Dean‘s list of honor
students, The entirc Dean's list had
little effect on the savage probes,
so she went home.

February 22 the Council had
interviewed 301 tnorc students.
which they turned over to the bi-
ology lab. This left 50 probationers~~

"The Life You Save"

Several unusual accidents
have occurred in the past week.
causing immeasurable damage
to the school and the student.
John l’archcd got his hand stuck
in the coke machine. and was
forced to wait until S.(‘. appro—
priated five cents in order to
free him. In the. Draper Lounge.
a small fire buran thrcc
couches, two chairs. a few stu-
dents. and 7.000 unsmokcd cig-
art-ties.

Meanwhile, six members of
the rifle club shot thcir months
off in an argumcnt over who
gets the Red Ryder B-B gun.
They refused to speak in any-
one until S‘.(‘. appropriated a
pair of rubber lips to each one.

Maurice Bollwecvil fell into
the vat of chicken soup while
waiting,r in lunch line. He was
sold, along with a spoon. for
twenty cents. Then of course
the cashier rcalizcd hcr mistake

. chicken soup is thirty cents.

The most amusing accident of
the week. however. was when
the entire ()uling ('lub was
