Opportunity To Study Abroad Leads With Victories In IM Play

By NORM KOSLOFSKY

(Continued from Page 3, Column 2)

Administration Have Coilaborated
to Issue a Decree." opposes the
semester hour penalty for unattend-
ed compulsory assemblies with a
logic so devoid of reason as to
make the valid segments of their
argument totally beclouded.

In past years myself and other
students at this college have oppos-
ed compulsory assemblies openly; I
am not at odds with the SDA news~
paper on this issue; I do, however.
object to the hysterical ranting of
the authors of "Student Appeal.”
The statements made in the above-
mentioned issue, were apparently
calculated negative and destructive.

The purported aim of “Student
Appeal” is, as stated in their ban-
ner. “to arouse some interest in
and lead to critical examination of
the inter-relationships among the
students and their governing and
administrative agencies." If this is
their aim. they have fallen much
"elow their mark; they have aimed
their paper at specious reasoning
and effete hysteria.

A point of interest is that al-
though “Student Appeal" is the of-
ficial SDA newspaper, the iiewspaper
of a politically oriented group. con-
tinual reference is made to The So-
ciety of Critical Thought, SOCT,
a supposedly non-political organ-
ization of clear thinking. The af-
filiation of these two organizations
which. seemingly are ideologically
opposed. would seem to indicate that
neither organization is being run in
line with its purposes. but rather.
in line with the immediate gripes
of its leadership.

There are many constructive ways
in which a group can oppose a stu-
dent or faculty act. Even changes
in the manner of expression of
ideas in “Student Appeal" could
greatly increase the interest aroused
and the support gained. When SDA
achieves a more matiu'e. democrat-
ically motivated and clear thinking
leadership they shall realize the
truth which they so failingly up-
hold.

Sincerely,
Arnold E. Elman. Grad.

The Soothing Sounds

State has been unusually
jazz-conscious this year as evi-
denced by the successful con-
certs that have colored the
Greek houses and Bru. Certain-
ly those who have offered their

est if nothing else.
