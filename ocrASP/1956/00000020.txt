Crisis Threatens

Treaty Organization's Existe nce

Bv FRANK

The South East Asia Treaty Or-
ganization has found two new chinks
in its armor. The chinks apeared in
the wake of anti-communist war
games recently completed in the vi-
cinity of Bangkok. Thailand.

The first is the instability of the
Indochinese kingdom of Laos. A full
scale civil war appears imminent
through the efforts of Viet Nam agi—
tators coupled with supplies of arms
obtained frotn Communist China.

The second chink is the one that
appears- in neighboring Cambodia.
The Premier of that. country, Prince
Ntzrodom Eihanouk. who is currently
in Peking. has announced that his
country will pull otit frotn the pro-
tection of SEATO. Although neither-
Cambodia or Laos are full-fledged
members of SEATO. they constitute
a vital link in the anti-communist
defense chain in the Near East.

In the case of Laos the threat of
civil war has grown worse follow-
ing the failure of the Royalist gov-
ernment and Coinmunist-sponsored
Pathet Lao movement to settle their
differences at three separate con—
ferences. The Pathet Lao dissidents
want control of the government.
They have a powerful bargaining
lever in that they control two of
Laos" northern provinces. The Roy-
alists argue that they were given
control of the government by a de—
cision at the Geneva Conference
and the International Annistice
Commission veriﬁed this. They say
that the people ratified their policies
by voting for them in last Decem-
ber's election. The Royalists say that
since the conferences have failed.
the only course opeit for them is to
crush the rebels. The problem that
faces the United States is that the
SEATO alliance provides help to
members who are attatked exter-
nally. Should the Royalists fail to
llt ld the tippcr hand there would be
little the United States could do.

The situation in Cambodia is
tqually dangerous for the United
States. The statement of Prince St—
l.anouk has pivoted Cambodia from
a close U.  friend iitto the neutral-
tst camn of India, Burma and Indo—
ticsizi. The United States not only
realizes that the loss of Cambodia

and Laos will leave a large hole in
SEATO but also will adversely af—
fect Thailand in its relations with
SEATO.

Although the recently completed
war games at Bangkok have left
Thailand confident, the, United
States has not missed the signiﬁ—
cance of the 12 man Thailand dele-
gation which has just arrived from
Peking with high praise for the
peaceful intentions of the Peking
regime.

The mission, although unsanc-
tioned and due for criticism froin
the government, still does not hide
the fact that neutralist sentiments
in Thailand are moving forward
constantly.

The United States has built a dike
to control the communist flood in
Asia. but its success depends on how
the United States maintains it. The
meek shall inherit the earth, all of
six feet.

A fraternity pledge of a western
college recently sued the fraternity
for injuries sustained during initi-
ation. The pledge was ordered to
sit on a bench :iiid watch the pro—
ceedings. He no more than go‘
suited when a h 'a'vy electric charge
passed through the bench. The
shock 'aused him to fall over back-
wards on the floor, and the pledge
received a herniated cervical dt.«c
The court upheld the cause and the
plaintiff received $34,000.
