Freedom 7 ? . . .

For past two weeks we have witnessed good student
assemblies. About every seat was filled and people got up
to say what they believed to be facts of the issue. This
issue is basic to student life and vital to each one of us—
will we continue this open discussion of student issues or
shall we delegate this power to a few that care to go and
push through motions in their favor.

Last Friday a standing vote proved that the majority
of students present want compulsory assemblies. To make
this power effective you have to back it up with force.
That force was killed when you voted to overrule the
Myskania plan for compulsion.

When you vote to defeat something of such great im—
portance to yourself think of the consequences and the
alternate plan which may develop. It is very simple to be
swayed by emotional speeches. But take them for what
they are worth. Balance them against the facts and the
good of the whole. Don’t let your personal laziness, called
freedom, defeat what is best for Student Association as a
whole.

BDay...

March 12, some of you freshmen will be asked to con—
sider whether or not you wish to join one of the four social
fraternities on campus. For the past few years the theme
of these organizations has been social acceptance. In short,
you either join a fraternity or go on through the rest of
your college career as a nothing. The idea behind social
acceptance lies in the fact that everyone needs a sense
of belonging to something. This is perfectly true, but one
must realize that there are other means of becoming so-
cially acceptable, such as in the field of athletics or student
government.

Before joining any organization you must ask yourself
two questions. First, what can I contribute to the good of
the organization, and secondly, what can the organization
do for me? In order to have a good balance, you should
be able to contribute something, and at the same time,
receive benefits from these organizations. Don’t join any-
thing which will serve you as a mere crutch to aid you on
such schemes as you may wish to perform. Don‘t be a
creeping parasite and merely hang on like a jellyfish to
satisfy your ego. If you decide to join be something in
your organization! Sotne members have been greatly dis-
illusioned by the utter failure, after two or three years, to
gain any particular significance by belonging to these or-
ganizations.

From the fraternity side of the picture we must recog—
nize the practical element. These organizations need
members to carry on their activities in future years. Some-
times a person serves merely as fodder to fill the ranks.
If this represents social acceptance to you, by all means
join. It will satisfy your need for a short time until you
begin taking stock and asking yourself a few questions
such as: Would I have gotten where I am without joining
this organization? Has it helped me in any way? Many
times these questions result in great disillusionment on
the part of the questioner.

If you are joining a social organization for the purpose
of suddenly sweeping to the fore, forget it. In the end, a
person is judged solely on his own merits, not on the basis
of any group to which he may belong. You ‘an become
no more than what you are capable of becoming.

If you're in a sadistic mood this
weekend, go to the Palace and see
The Last Hunt. This movie shows
us how buffalo came to sad, dis-
graceful, aiid boring ends in the
Old West. Stewart Granger and
Robert Taylor are in there shoot-
ing, and one feels sure that between
them they will eventually kill every
last buffalo in the Old West. Of
course, the Indians will starve if
they succeed. So there is conflict.
Debra Paget is in this too.

Ill-Yo, Etc.

For those of you who appreciate
rare and unusual movies, a special
surprise awaits you at the Strand.
The movie is (and get this) The
Lone Ranger, and no one needs to
be told what to expect. They're. all
here—the Masked Rider, his faithful
Indian companion Tonto, and the
thundering hooves of the great horse
Silver! Yes. the Masked Rider rides
again! Nowhere in the pages of his—
tory can one find a greater cham-
pion of justice, believe me.

To the Editor:

thii Sttidciit Association voted
in Assembly last week to veto My-
skania's decision concerning super-
vision of non-academic matters,
tncy moved just one step further
towards the complete downfall and
disintegration of our student gov-
ernment. Every year for the past
four, the Association has voted to
keep the compulsory assembly and
each year the attendance falls to
a new low. If it keeps tip as in the.
past the iiSscinbty will be coiiiptctc-
ty empty next year. It appears they
are behaving as L‘IIII(Il‘f‘lt-~tlblf' to
sec their responsibility, btit unable
to assume it. What they need is a
good, stiff punishment to compel
them to attend tticse meetings
which they have demanded.

Last Week they voted down that
stiff punishment. yet, IlypOf’l‘ILIL‘ilIIy,
they voted for the compulsory tis-
sembly. Why have a compulsory
assembly if there is nothing to coni-
pet attendaiicc‘.’

KIND WORDS ()l" .\D\'l(‘1-l

A fraternity is a small, isolated, closch -knit grottp of friends. An
individual can gain much from fraternity membership. If is indeed tin—
fortunate th.if the dozen or so fraternities at State are banded together
tiito four larger groups. But don't let that deter you, frosli! Join one
of these groups! Only such institutions 21s Fort. Dix give you a better
chance to make friends in wholesale tots. Only the Good, Dependable
individuals hold the reactionary view that they should be pcn'nittcd to
choose all their friends, and do so one at it time.

We understand that apparently the WAA Basketball Leagues started

some games, the only ones who show up at Page are the basketballs.
Must be that all the :itlecscs have their WAA tee shirts.

Purchasing Firm

Forty Distributive Education stu-
dents wilt leave Wednesday at 8
am. for New York City to visit
Frederick Atkins Iiic., resident buy—
ers. This company is the buying

members of the Distributive Educa—
tion Chib, a student. organization.
which tias Erwin Horowitz as its
President. This is an annual event
for the future teachers of business
and distributive education subjects.
Previous strips were. made to Macy's
Department Store, Henry Roscnfeld,
noted dress manufacturer, and the
B. Altman Department Store.

Oneonta To Interview

man Hall Father Mulkahey will
present the second in a series of
lectures oti the Reformation. This
week's topic will be “The Personal
Life of Luther."

Bernice O'Connor '57, President of
Newman Club reports that the New-
man Communion Breakfast will be
held in the Vincentian Cafeteria on
March 18th. Tickets are fifty cents.

 

Nun! ice-mm

Last summer, TV fans were
thrilled when a Marine sergeant
won $64000 with his vast knowl-
edge of the culinary art—cook—
ing. to you. Women all over the
nation began flipping through
the pages of dusty cook books
looking for exotic dishes to re-
place their nightly “meat and
potatoes" dish.

We here at State challenge
the. producers of that famed
quiz show to a culinary duel.
We'll pit Joe Swicrzowski, chef
at the Sigma Lambda Sigma
house, against any cooking ex-
pert they can find. Since Swizz
has reigned over the frying pan
at the house, two of its inhabit-
ants have gained fifteen pounds
and the group expects to save
$1,000 because of Swizz’s using
the least to make the best.

If a few of you don't know
this expert. look for him in the
Knickerbocker News; you can't
miss Iiim . . . he'll be holding-
a pork chop!

At the last Student Christian As-
sociatlon meeting, Doris Fradenburg
'57 was elected President. and Clin-
ton Carpenter ’57 was elected Vice-
President. Lenten suppers are held
every Wednesday evening at the
apartment of Frances Colby, Associ-
ate Professor of English. The topic
for discussion at this week’s meeting
will be “Comparison of the Gospels
during Holy Week." Thursday at
7:30 the regular meeting will be held
in Brubacher Hall. The topic will be
“What do you think about the
Resurrection?" Reverend R o b e rt
Garvin will lead the discussion.

SCA, in conjunction with the A1-
baiiy Federation of Churches and
other area student groups, is spon-
soring a student parley at the
Trinity Methodist Church on March
18 from 5:30 to 9 pm. The speaker

of Life?" Registration is $1.00 includ-
ing a buffet supper. For reservations
