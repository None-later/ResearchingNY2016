By ZACH CLEMENTS

The State College wrestling team
recently completed its first inter-
collegiate season of wrestling. Un-
der the expert guidance and coach-
ing of Joe Garcia the Peds enjoyed
a most successful season. Coach
Garcia trained, taught, and achiev-
ed a winning season in State‘s var-
sity wrestling debut.

In the eight matches the Feds
wrestled. they won five while losing
three. Suffering setbacks were. R.P.I.
(twice). Brooklyn Poly. Tech.. and
Paul Smith's College (twice). In
achieving victory in these five tilts
the Garciamen garnered 109
points, while the opposition could
only muster 68. The three Albany
losses included M.I.T., Oswego State
Teachers, and Clarkson. The States-
men in losing three matches
scored 34 points. while the victors
copped 66. This brings the total
points for State 143, opponents 134.

Those who wrestled for the State
matmen are as follows:

Wt. Cl. Name Mat. Pts. W L. D
123 W. Harvey B 26 6 2

Coed Swimming Club
Holds First Meeting

The newly organized Swimming
Club held it's first meeting of the
season at the Public Bath No. 3
located on the corner of Central and
Ontario. Around 15 people turned
out as training in competitive and
synchronized swimming began.
Sponsored by both WAA and AMIA,
the female contingent far outnum-
bered the men at the ﬁrst gathering
It is hoped that more males will
turn out during the next ten weeks
for which time the pool has been
rented.

Wayne Harvey had been riding

an undefeated season when he and
Don Bindrum switched weight class-
es. In his next two outings Wayne
suffered setbacks but came back
strong to finish the season by pin—
ning his opponent. Don picked up
three consecutive wins in his new
surroundings. The loss of Bill Gropp
after the fourth match of the sea~
son hurt the Peds. but big Ted
Chewinski came off the inactive list
to fill the breach. Bill's elbow. which
was dislocated, has healed very well
and Bill hopes to see action next
year. When Burt Rounds had to re-
tire due to scholastic reasons, Bill
Mackie, an inexperienced freshman,
came out and put up a great show-
ing. Al Tuttle who filled in for Ed
Weaver was also a standout.

It was the great team spirit and
unified team efforts that helped the
Garciamen gain such a successful
season. Coach Garcia feels that if
all players return. and the same
team spirits prevails next year —
LOOK OUT!

To the Editor:

When leaving for the Weekend trip
to Potsdam and Plattsburgh. tlic
basketball team was interested in
the letter to the editor signed by
the “Spectator.” We thought that
it Would be appropriate to answer
this letter,

To start with. we cliallciigc the
point that "not many atlilctcs ill'L‘

Plattsburgh last Saturday night, the
Feds ended the season by being
shim by the undefeated Cardinals.
F‘our members of the home team
were in double figures. with Mur-
ray Bullock high with 22. Gary
Holway again paced State with a
final total of 19. It was a tight
contest throughout, and the Feds
were able to gain a lead after three
seconds of the second half. From
there. the score was .kiiotted four
different times. but the Cardinals
had a little too much for the Peds.
and wound up a three-point victory.
Due to the lack of space. the sea-
sonal statistics for individual cag-
ers will appear in next week's issue
of the News. However, as a point of
information. we would like to note
that Gary Holway fell but three
points short of the 500 circle with
497 points for the season. Another
point of interest at this time is that
Jack Minon has been named as
next year's captain. Jack had a lit-
tle better than an eight point aver-
age this year,
