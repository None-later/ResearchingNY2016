You Can Be In The Limelight; Stale Exchanges

All You Have To Do Is Try Three Students

By A It’l‘ PALAZZOLO

Just about everyone wants to be
populnr~don‘t you? There are, of
course. various ways of gaining pop-
ularity. You could go around being
nice to people. but then, nice peo-
ple are often lost in the shuffle of
college life. And anyway. one doesn’t
have to be. nice to be. popular. (Be-
ing nice can be an asset though.)
There are other ways. Girls have
various gimmicks that are rather
effective which can be observed al-
most any night of the week in the
Union. A rather common practice
among our fairer sex is that of
wearing sweat shirts emblazoned
with the names of universities other
than that of State. It matters not
what college. be it Lowrr Podunk U.
or Gopher Hill Tech. so long as it
is different. When a girl walks into
the Union wearing a Gopher Hill
Tech sweater. one immediatciy as-

sumes (naturally enoughi that some
lad from “Old G.H.T." gave it to
her as a token of his esteem-«and
everyone knows what a G.H.T. grad
cams on the. outside!

Men are no more immune from
“Limelight; Fever" than are the
girls. Proof of this is visible from
thc array of multicolored jackets.
swcalcrs. T-shirts. bcanics. ribbons,
scraggly sideburns. struggling
goalccs. fuzzy upper lips. close-
croppcd domes—ail of which can
bc noticed «without even trying)
anywhere on campus.

l'i'u cited just a few ways of
gaining popularity and becoming
“onc of lhc gang." Some are start-
ling. some amusing. but all are in-
tcrcsling. In closing I Would like
to quote John Dewey till all due
apologies to the Ed. Dcpta who once
said: “(ind bless college life!"

I had as Napoleon and tiie in-
dividuaiity I enjoyed as Adam.

ber that the doctor told me to
be back in my padded ('cil be»

dear.
