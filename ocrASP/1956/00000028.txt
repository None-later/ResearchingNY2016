STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. MARCH 23. 1956

 

The Oral Interpretation Class,
aided by the Dramatics and Arts
affiliates, presented its second pro-
gram of Readings from Literature
this past Tuesday evening, March
20. Frieda. Cohen welcomed the
audience and introduced the read-
ers for the evening.

Edgar Allen Poe’s. “The Cask of
Amontillado,” as interpreted by
Norman Strite, was the opening se-
lection. This reading began on an
expressive and suspenseful note,
which was enhanced by appropri-
ate gestures. but unfortunately de—
creased ln effectiveness. As Strite
continued. his gestures tended to
become mechanical, and the tran-
sitions and general narrative skill
weakened, thus making any attempt
at a climax unsuccessful. However,
the earlier excellent characteriza-
tion of Fortunate did serve to re-
deem the reading somewhat.

Barbara Baum followed with a se-
lection from Bambi by Felix Salten.
The presentation of this reading
was as fresh and bright as the sub-
Ject matter itself. Her character-
izations. particularly those of the
grasshopper and the butterfly, were
delightful. At a few points. the dif-
ferentiation between the fawn and
his mother became a little obscure.
but the reading as a whole was very
good.

In the next presentation, a selec-
tion from Emily Bronte's Wuthering
Heights as interpreted by Lili Fer-
rara. the reader's study and aware-
ness of the implications of the scene
were evident from her competent
portrayal of the various reactions
of the young girl and the servant.
However, at times the transitions
were slow. and Inore could have
been done throughout with gesture
and facial expression.

Donald Murdoch next delighted
the audience with a very competent
interpretation of Stephen Leacock’s
“The Great Detective." He gave this
hilarious bit of exposition just the
right light touch that it needed,
making best use of the art of hes-
itation and the off~hand manner in
the relation of the narrative,

Carbone reading “The Little Black
Boys" by Clara Laidlow. Miss Car-
bone established and maintained a
very poignant mood throughout,
which was appropriate for this
touching story. The reading was
further enhanced by her wonderful
characterizations of the two little
black boys, but I felt that more at-
tention could have been paid to
the direct speeches of the teacher,
for they tended to blend with the
narrative to a great extent.

It was encouraging to see the
larger audience, but there were still
many empty seats. The next pro-
gram will be April 24. Plan to at-
tend and make it a full house, won't
you?

Bicycles Ready

The Senior Class of Paterson State
Teachers College held a contest to
give the student body an opportu-
nity to choose the "most absent-

Participation in this contest re-
quired the voter to drop a coin in

Cogers To Elect
Ail-Sior Team

The selection of the first Albany
State All-Star basketball team is
undergoing completion; games will
be played this Saturday among the
selected All-Stars.

This practice is going to be follow-
ed in all Intramural sports in coni-
ing years. The Intramural Council
hopes that an incentive such as this
will increase participation in all
sports.

The procedure for electing the
All—Star team is by preferential vote
of the men playing in each league.
They are to select six men in their
own lcaguc and submit said list to
the captain of their team.

The purpose of this team is not
primarily to give individual achieve—
ment praise. but to enable Albany
to try and establish :in Intercol-
legiate Intramural Association with
other schools. An attempt is being
made to schedule games with Union.
Siena, and RPI.

sessions.

Returning to the Fed Squad this
year will be Sandy Bernstein, who
is an infielder. C‘thcr iiii‘ielders who
are returning to the Purple and
Gold are: Al Lcdcrman. Luke Sand-

to the outfield is Wayne Overton.
The only returning pitcher is Bob
Pﬁeffer.

New hurlers out for the team are:
Bob Devlin, Dave Oakleaf. Mario
Scalzi, Harry Hershﬁeld, and Conrad
Schmidt. Devlin. is an cx-Albany
High athlete who enjoyed some very
successful seasons before entering
the service. Coach Sauers feels that
this fellow may be able to help the
team quite a bit.

Coach Sauers hopes to get the
team outside as soon as we get some
clearing weather (if ever). The
Peds will inaugurate the current
season, a 16 game slate. on Satur-
day. April 21. against Hartwick Col-
lege. The affair is a double-header
and should give the Peds a good
test in their ﬁrst game. All home
games will be played at Blceker
