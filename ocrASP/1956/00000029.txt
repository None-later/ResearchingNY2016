srAre’coL‘LEoE‘ News. FRIDAY. MARCH 23. 1956

Faces Crisis

Over Southern Integration Issue

By FRANK

The Democratic Party of the
United States is facing a crisis that
will either make the party stronger
or destroy it. The decision it faces
is whether to accept the manifesto
of the Southern Democrats or to
assert itself once and for all against
the Calhoun element of the party
which is living in a century that
has been gone with the wind for
more than a hundred years.

Supreme Court Decision

The Democratic Party, if it is to
challenge its opposite number
spearheaded by the most personally
popular President since Theodore
Roosevelt, must unify itself. The
Supreme Court decision for the de-
segregation and integration of
schools Clearly brought out the in-
secure unity of the Democratic
Party. The introduction of this pol-
itical manifesto just before a pres-
idential election shows how fana-
tical the belief of white supremacy
is still prevalent in the South de-
spite the fact that a war disproved
this theory. This misnomer is
stressed despite the acknowledg-
ment of most Southerners that the
economic upward movement of the
Negro will continue and that, in the
course of decades a changed and
improved status is almost inevitable.

Democrats Chance Split

This manifesto has also shown that
the Southern Democrats will chance
a split to press home their view. The
Southern congressmen have every-
thing to lose and little to gain by
a third party split. The 1948 cam-
paign of J. Sturm Thurmond should
have driven home that point to
them. Harry Truman, by moving his
platform to the left on civil rights,
destroyed the foundation of the
Dixiecrat Party thereby rendering
it harmless.

The Northern Democrats have
made it clear that they will stand
firm against this outdated. time-
worn dogma of trite. They realize,
along with a few Southern liberals,
Senator Estes Kefauver 1D) of
Tennessee a n (1 Representative
Thurmond Chatam of North Caro-
lina 1131, that this is a nation. and
not a confederation.

Presidential Proposal

The present administration is
prepared not to let this matter slide;
nor could it even if it wished to do
so. The President will shortly pro-
pose to Congress the following: ill
Funds to set up a new assistant
Attorney General in the Department
of Justice in charge of civil rights
cases and 42) a bi-partisan coin-
mission to study Negro charges of
discrimination,

The Democratic Party may still
have a chance to compromise its
differences, but this is unlikely.
Both sides know the one which gives
in will be finished as far as party
politics go on a national level. The
Solid South is in control of Con-
gress and they do not intend to re-
lcasc it. The important. committee-
ships are governed by seniority
which means the Democrats are
also in control oi this phasc of na-
thillitl government. A committee
chairman can pidgcou-hole or just
forget to present a bill to Congress
for action, or else they can push it
vigorously. A good example of this
is the Natural Gas Act that, thc
Dcmmti'ats wanted passed to be us-

ed for a prize for campaign contrib—

floor leader, tried to hurry it
through, but a bribe attempt and
unwanted publicity resulted in a
presidential veto. All is not dark
though for the Southern Democrats;
they still have the trump card, Sen-
ator Eastland, Chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee which
prepares all legislation dealing with
civil rights for presentation to Con-
gress. The Democratic Party may
find that it is in the position of
the Republican Party in 1948. This
was the incident of the special ses-
sion of Congress wherc Harry Tru-
man dared the Republican Congress
to pass measures the Republican
Party was using as a platform. Tru-
man knew the Republicans did not
have that much strength. The Dem-
ocrats will have to do some quick
thinking on this matter. Your cane.

Council Recomm

State Legislature
Gives Money
For Construction

As a result of the 1956 State
Budget, the State College for Teach-
ers at Albany has received an ap-
propriation of $1,550,000 for the
construction of a new library. speci-
iies Evan R. Collins, President of the
College. Since this is a state stip-
p'u'tcd college, our building program
is subject to appropriations from
the State legislature.

State building programs are con—
ducted in three stages, the planning,
construction, and equipment stages.
An appropriation is necessary be-
fore each stage can be undertaken.
Planning money is used to hire an
architect to plan the project. This
is followed by the construction stage
which is the present state of the
library.

At the present time the plans for
the library have not been completed
because the site for the building is
still being negotiated for by the
State. The building will hold 150,000
volumes as compared with the pres-
ent. 55,000 volumes in the college
and Nlllllt‘ libraries. There will be
desk study space for approximately
100?) students which is an increase
of 700 seats from the present build—
ing. The building will be broken up
into several small reading and ref—
erence rooms. There will also be
four ollicc rooms for the Depart-
ment of Librarianship, and seven
,iudcnt workrooins for the library
dcparitznciit,

Plans have hlsri been proposed for
the use of the present library biiild—
111".. it has becn considcred for a
:Iudcnt social building which would
inciudc a cafeteria, snack bar, game
room. and lounges.

Construction of a new dorm will
begin this scuson. Architectural
plans have been approved. Construc-
tion will not begin for at least an-
other month as bids for construction
havc not yet been advertised. The
dorm will house 200 students and
will hove no dining room facilities. '
This will provide for an L-shaped
building parallel to Brubachcr and
l.l‘.cn cxtcnding perpendicular to
Brubachcr out to Western Avenue.
Futurc plans include a similar dorm
on Pill‘ll'lll1.,t' Street, and a separate
dining hall.

Money has also bccn appropriated
for the planning stage of a hcallh
and physical cdiiciition building, The
collcuo uho has money for 1hc grad-
ur: and tll'illllllll‘. of St, Mary's
Park winch will include 12 tennis
tourls on Washington Avenue and
