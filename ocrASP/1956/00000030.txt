Animals And Animals. . .

During our trips around the school this
week we have readily noted some of the
effects of sorority pledging. We have seen
stuffed animals, knee socks and various and
sundry articles in an attempt to see which
sorority can sponsor the most ridiculous
looking pledges.

We have noticed little response to the
appeal for workers for Pedagogue. but there
will be an awful hue and cry when the
yearbooks do not come out on time. In
fact. we fail to notice anything being done
by the pledges which even closely resembles
constructive action.

The big problem with pledges seems to
be a sort of misplaced allegiance. All other
activities seem to fall as pledge duties as—
sume gigantic importance. Pledges give up
much time performing their duties—time
which could be spent for better purposes.
The first allegiance any student has is to
his school. If you don‘t believe this state— 
ment you don't belong in college. Sorority  
or anything else is secondary to the weliarc a
of your school.

The purpose of sorority pledging is sup- vmmwm
posed to unite the mambers Of a Sonn'll’y- The ~dandhook tells us lliill wiyslx'iiiiia members are chosen for their

The People's Choice?

Within the mind of each individual there
is a standard and grouping of values. Some
things are held very high on this scale. We
not only stand in awe of these heights but
we also respect them. One IofIthese high
values is justice and impartiality. I

This is one of the qualifications we aSSign
to each individual on Myskania, the Ju-
dicial Society of the college. All freshmen
stand in awe of the honorary group but
with each successive college year of a stu-v
dent, the members become more human, as
opposed to divine, and less respected in the
eyes of their fellow students. I I

Unfortunately this attribute of impartial-
ity has been betrayed. Even Myskania has
fallen to a vote which might be construed
to have been cast on personalities rather
than on concrete qualifications. This was
evidenced by the absences in this weeks
list of their recommendations and sugges-
tions for their replacements.

We have this question to ask the present
Myskania. Are you serving the JudlClIal
function for which you were founded? Did
you consider your decision from an impar-
tial viewpoint?

Get Well . . .

We think that the Editors are expressing
the feeling of the entire student body by
saying that we are happy to hear that 
Murphy and the men in the laboratory with
him at the time of the expios10n are im-
proving rapidly. We also wish toIcommIend
the four on their attitude and high spirits
during their prolonged stay in the hospital.

Nations General Assembly. The ses-
sion was held at State Teachers
College. Indiana, Pennsylvania.

The conference started Wednes-
day cvcning. March 28. and lasted
until Friday noon, March 30. Each
of the «ill colleges attending. repre-
sented a member country of the
UN.

Shite represented Argentina. Each
college had at least four delegates.
These delegates were assigned to
caucuses which discussed current
U.N. problems. Thursday the dele—
gates incl. in conferences and Work—
ed out resolutions which expressed
the foreign policy of the nations
they represented. Some of these
resolutions dealt with such topics as
Iiiiplemetitiition of Arab—Israel
'i‘ruce. Establishment of an Inter-
national Finance Corporation. Uni—
l'ication of Togoialid Trust Terri-
tories. and the question of disarma-
iiiciii. After much heated debate
and many concessions, the resolu-
tions were modified and adopied. A
Plenary Session oi the (icncral As-
sembly was held Friday morning
and the resolutions received ilieii'
final vote. A Conference Critique
was held to dcierinine how well each
college had represented ilie country
to which they had been assigned.
The session was concluded with a
speech by Mrs. Franklin 1). ltoosc-
velt on. "’i‘hc Responsibility of tile
U. S_ (‘llllt'll :it Home and in the
UN."

The delegates icli that by repre-
senting foreign countries they gain-
ed a new insighi iiiio the problems
lliai lace ilie U.N. We are pleased
to say that during the time devoted
to the evolution of the conference.
State received no adverse criticism
for the way in which we represented
Argentina. We believe tliai ilic dele-
gates acquired many new ideas for
