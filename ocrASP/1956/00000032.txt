From the Herald
Yale has raised the requirements
for bcing named to the Dean's List
because today‘s students are getting
higher marks. The purpose of the
revised regulations is to preserve
the prestige of the Dean‘s List
which in the past 10 years has
grown to the point where it con-
tains the names of almost half the
undcrgraduatcs in Yale Univcrsiiy.
