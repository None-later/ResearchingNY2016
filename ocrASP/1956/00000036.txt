ALBANY. NEW YORK. FRIDAY. APRIL 27. 1956

VOL. XLI NO. to

 

SA Will Vote

f9 Assembly;
An Individual Challenge . . .

VOTE. VOTE! Today is the day for action. Talk is
over. Now We need to elect capable people to lead our stu-
dent government and classes.

This year we have been faced with many unforeseen
problems and situations. We lost the use of our meeting
place and had to initiate a type of representative govern-
ment; we bought a college camp this year; we have amend-
cd our constitution and formulated a new type of student
government. To do this has required the alert decisions
and actions of capable leaders.

In the past years we have made mistakes and we did
this year. People have been elected who were not prepared
for their new responsibilities. They were elected beause
of personal reasons.

Next year our officers will face new problems; our
college is continuing to grow and to bring new problems
to the surface. The problems of off-campus teachers los-
ing contact with their college will become a reality with
ilie new Education Department plan for student teaching.

Each one of us will have to live under the leadership
of the new officers who will try to cope with these problems.
None of us 'an escape the effects of our student gOVcrn—
ment.

it is the responsibility of every member of Student
Association to cast his vote for the 'iiiididatc he thinks
best qualified. If you have an assigned seat in Assembly
you must vote in assembly. You need not sit in your as-
signed seat. (‘heck the list on the Student Council bulletin
board in Upper llusted to see if you have a seat. ’l‘hose
excused front assembly and those who do not have a seat
vote absentee from 9 a.m. to Ll pm. at the voting desk in
Lower lliisted.

A few minutes taken to select good candidates may
make a great dcal of difference next year. Let‘s prove that
w i are not apathetic. Today is V~Day. It is the end of one
battle and the beginning oi another.

You can make the difference. No one can make a mess
of student government and activity more than you do when
you don't vote. Instead of just complaining most of the
time take an active stand. Your college ~an only be as
great as you make it. It is an individual challenge. ’l‘o
rephrase the motto of the State University. “Let each do all
he is 'apable of doing.“

DOMINICK l)c(‘E(‘(.‘()

Mr. President. members of My-
skzinia. Students. I come before you
today as a candidate for the office
of Student Association President. I
hope that you will accept the plat-
i'orm which I bring before you and
that you will support it with all
your power.

I feel that the general :tll' oi
apathy which pervades this school
is not caused by students In general,
I feel that this feeling of apathy
has been built up by some people to
such an extent that it has been
used as an excuse for many ot the
tziiiurcs present in our govci'iiiiiciit
today. I believe that the new sys—
tem oi legislative convocation will
generate more enthusiasiit because
it will concentrate on important
issues only. The minor details
which prove so boring to many will
be eliminated by iiiial action on the
part of Student Council and Sin“
dciit Board of Finance This apathy
can be attacked positncly throuin
orientation on the part of counsel—

I would like to present the iol-
lowingi platform for your constdci'a-

dency of Student Association.

1. January Elections: 1 now feel
that there is a deiiiiite need for
January elections with the increased
emphasis ptit upon practice teach-
ing. Involved in these elections

would be all 5. A. officers except
Myskiinia members. I teel that a
second semester Junior is capable

and qualiiicd to hold the office of
Student Association President. With
this plan. the president would both
have more time to devote 'o the
office and to his pi‘iit'tssioiial semes-

ter of practice teaching and ttudies.
II. Student Council As An Advis-
