The University Dally Knnsan

one of its students: Penny wise and
pound foolish is a misnomer for Bill
Breyfogle. Olathe Junior. Bill has
saved 55,000 zinc pennies (all 1943

«ave money." Soon he had practic-
ally everyone in Olathe sorting the
zinc and copper pennies. He has
siored the pennies in milk bottles.
He now has more than 40 quarts of
zinc pennies.

This could put a wholc new life

would ultc approval to oriianira-

tha‘ .i garty system in the school
could do no harm With a party
system. more intensive campaigning
could take place and more lllli‘l‘CSl
would be aroused in the school.
Pcoplc would get to know (andi-
datcs better and therefore votc more
zviscly. ’l'his arouscd intcrcst would
srcm naturally to curiy into student
govcrnmcnt and would begin to
combat thc problcms of apathy that
wc all havc such an intcrcst in.

V. Student Council Policies: 1
would try to keep Student Council
at. the high level of efﬁciency it.
now has. To add to this cfficiciicy.
I would like to see the tcntativc
asstmbly agendas and studcnt coun-
('li alcndas published one \vcck lll

l'll(l I would likc in sc( a fund bcgun
in which moncy would bc savcd to

ciicouricu'd to (‘Ullll'llllllt‘ to thc

less record and install it in the juke
box in the Student Union.

Now for five cents anyone can
buy three minutes of comparative

A professor of paleontology mis-
placed a quiz key in a pile of stu-
dent test papers. When he started
to grade the tests. be discovered the
loss and made another key. After
correcting the papers—including thc
key—he discovered that the key had
made the grand score of 70 per cent.

A freshman at Kansas State who
wanted to quit smoking but couldn‘t,
decided to try hypnotism. A doctor
hypnotized the student at an as-
sembly. He told him that he would
be able to break the habit becausc
from then on cigarettcs would tastc
like burnt rubber.

The young man was then releas—
ed from the spell. A few weeks later
the student announced. “I still havc
the habit. but the burnt rubber flav-
or annoys me!"

Honorable Myskania, and Mem-
bers of Student Association: Stu—
dent Government here at State
College is in a state of flux; it is
at a point of change. It has
changed. it is changing now and it
will continue to change during the
coming year. Increasing enrollment
has made these changes—changes
in procedure and thinking manda-
tory. If we are not at a point of
crisis, we are at least at a critical
point in the development of our
Student Government.

We need leaders of proven ability.
sincerity of purpose. and a strong
desire to work for the best interests
(if all the members of the College.
If you. the members of Student As-
sociation choose me to be your
Vice-Presidcnt. I shall endeavor to
give you the bcst possible student
government, I shall work to the
upiiiost of my capacities and abili-
ties to see that our Convocation
Assemblies are utilized to the full
cxtcnd of their. potential: I shall
work purposcly and forthrightly in
my capacities on Student Council
and Stuticnt Board of Finance to
see that tho best interests (if llic
studcnts arc acliicvcd. Finally
shall C(iopcralc fully and faithfully
with thc SA. Prcsidcni to insurc
1 maximum of organization and
smoothncss in tlic functioning of
the Studciit Association.

I shall t’(|ll.\l(it‘l' it. (i boiior and a
privilcitc to bc your Vicc Pi'csidﬂib—
and morc cspccially I shall consider
it my duty to affirm your faith in
inc by working to the bcst of my
abilities to provide Stiitc Coilch

Association
Campaign Manager:

At assembly last week each of the
candidates for Student Association
President were introduced by their
campaign managers. Marilyn De-
Santa introduced Dominick DeCec-
co and Barbara Hungerford intro-
duced Clyde Payne, both are Jun-
iors.

Mr. President, Members of Stu-
dent Association: We are all aware
of the problems we face at State.
This year We have done something
to alleviate this problem——we have
amended our constitution. Now we
need a strong leader to initiate this
new plan.

We need hotly contested debates
to arouse interest in assembly. We
need better integration of various
groups into student government, for
example, the Veterans organization.
We need more interest in govern-
ment. We need a larger slate of
candidates running for office. We
need January to January elections
to alleviate the problem of off
campus student teaching. We need
a positive approach to apathy
through wider publicity for student
government and student affairs.

What type of candidate do you
nch to :arry this out? You need
(in active. alert, strong president.
You need someone who can settle
disputes. think clearly and arbitrate
justly.

Who is this
DcCccco.

Ai'tcr a humorous entrance Bar-
bara Hinigcrfurd introduced Clyde
Payne.

pt‘l'Stm '9 — Dominick

Myskania. Student Association.
Clyde Payne is the man for next
year's president of our Student As-
sociation. He. above all, has had
the experience in student govern-
ment that is needed for such a
position.

In his freshman year he was
clccicd Presidcni. of the Class of
1957 and served his class well. As
prcsidcnt hc was a class representa-
tivc to Student Council for the Class
of ‘37, And then this year you
clccicd him Vice President of our
Student Association. In this posi—
tion hc scrvcd as Vice President of
Student Council. ho was Student
Council's representative to Student
Board of Finance.

Need I say? I think it is apparent
that with this record behind him.
Clydc Payne is the pcrsou we need
for next ycar‘s President of Student
Association.

and thc ail‘a.i's of Student
Council in doing this, I have i(|l~-
lowcd thc proccdurc of our school
govcrnmcnt and I understand how
it is opcratcd, I would like to help
uicr~asc tlic good q..alitics of our
school and I ccrtainly would be will-
mg and able to tak| any steps ncc-
cssary to bring this about.

i will (in my best. in performing
ibc dutics of tlic officc and I sin-
(‘crcly liopc that 1 will bc able to

ability. Again I say. I am vcry iii-
tcrcsicd lll siudcnt govcrnmcnl and

Ella Miucll

Mys'kania and mciiibcrs oi Stu-
dcni. Association: If you will allow
mc, I would likc to dcpart from the
usual campaign spcccli. 'l‘lici'c is a
lllllt'll cruitcr problem facing us; it
is mainly the turnout. at the pond-

mg clcction. 0f cours‘c. tlici'c is
nothing that would givc inc murc
plciisurc than winning thc position

as SA sccrclury; but should I fail
to win. at lcast those persons who
wcrc clccicd will have tlic satisfac-
tion of knowing that they have tlic
support of (( gi'cat iiizijurity nf ilic
studcni body.

I shall continuc to work to my

sary for cvcry student possiblc to
