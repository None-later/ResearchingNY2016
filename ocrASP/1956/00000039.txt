Kemp] Kammedd . . .

by BOB KAMPF

Now a days, the sport commonly
known as softball has turned into a
mere exaggeration of football. What
with scores of 21-20, 20-15, 27-0, 27-
2, shades of Johnny Lujack are
passing over State College. . ..Track
appears to be getting on its feet and
pulling away from the starting post.
Could be that the articles in last
week’s News woke up a few track-
minded men, or that the change in
the weather has brought a change
in numbers. Now, we're looking
forward to that opening meet w1th
RPI next week. . . . Speaking of RPI
and track, there was a miler over
there this past weekend who cut
seconds off the old RPI record, and
was trying to make like Roger
Bannister. Indoor sport is

Riile Group To Hold
Meeting Wednesday

The State College Riﬁe Club.
which got off to a fast start last
year in its ﬁrst year of operation
and has since found itself declining,
is again appealing to all those inter-
seted to come out and help the
group and themselves back on their
feet again.

Hold Meeting

There will be a meeting held for
this purpose Wednesday at
7:30 pm. in Brubacher. At this
time ofﬁcers will be elected and
plans will be laid out for next year.
It is hoped that next year a riﬂe
team may be organized. An instruc-
tion program is also being planned

Use Army Reserve Range

The Club has the use of the Army
Reserve Range and supplies all am—
mo and targets. Rifles for the group,
under the National Rifle Association.
may be obtained only if more turn
out to participate in the group's
activities.

reaching its zenith here at State.
They say that when spring comes,
a young man’s fancy turns to
thoughts of love. So, we believe it
already. . . . Stopped down to watch
a volleyball game the other night,
and found that this sport is as
rough as Jai-lai. One poor protege
had his glasses ripped completely
from his head as the volley-bullet
came piercing through the sound
barrier and made direct contact
with his nose. . . . By the looks of
things in the Albany Softball
League, it looks quite a bit like the
Potter will stick their feet in the
championship catagory. In their
last two games they scored over
forty-ﬁve runs while limiting their
opponents to two. Bob Fox
makes his ﬁrst appearance as an
All-Star pitcher on the stage of
Pa;e this Moving-Up Day, and the
hearsay is that he‘s due to take a
terrific spill as he dances his way
on to the mound. Could mean that
he's a little "Rocky". . In one
softball game this week, the losing
team committed seine thirty errors
lyes, thirty). This calls for a basket
club to help support softball teams,
does it not? . . .

Nominations Open
For AMIA Heads

As evident by the large number
of posters covering the walls of the
peristyle, it's election time again and
with it comes the appearance of the
nomination shoot for AMIA officers.

Nominations ()pen

Present AMIA heads have an-
nounced that any male student at
State may nominate. but those noni-
mated for ofﬁce must have had at
least one year experience on the
group's committees or boards. This
would include 1. Ofﬁcer. 2. Commis-
sioner and 3. League Assistant.

Potter Trounces

Two Foes As

Big Scores Continue To Roll In-

Things got closer to normal in the
intra-mural softball league; that is
if you call an average of 27 runs a
ball game near normal. The main
reason seems to lie in the lack of
good pitching, plus loose ﬁelding.

Potter got off to a flying start,
completely swamplng their two op-
ponents. First they crtished the
APAchies. 30-2 and then “edged”
the Rousers. 26—0. Hank Muller
came through with two tremendous
pitching efforts, relinquishing just
two hits in each game and walking
a total of only eight men. Baker.
Stark and Muller collected ﬁve hits
apiece to lead the slugging while
the team hit big innings of 15 and
12 runs.

member of the Vets

League got

set by knocking off their ﬁrst team,
APA, 15-10. They had a eight run
fourth inning to rap things up.
Swenson staggered through for the
win.

KB got tromped twice as Loonils
failed to live tip to his pitching
promise. However, the fault Is not
all his as the defense behind him
was not too encouraging. They were
beaten by the Potter Sophs, 16-5
and the Vets, 19-6.

Potter Sophs Downed

In the lowest scoring game of the
week. SLS downed the Potter Sophs
13-7. Ormsbee threw a ﬁne game
for the winners giving up seven hits
and six walks. Call, Carter and
Treadway collected three hits apiece
to lead the slugging. The Pogos
squeeked pass APA 19-18 with six
runs in the seventh. Weierniiller and
Holway led the team with three hits.
In the only other game the Vcts
beat Ridge. 18-12. The losers put on
a last ditch effort with an eight
run seventh but fell short. Philsteln
got the win while Sullivan garnered
three hits.

The sports spotlight is again
centered on softball. This week it
falls on the pitching department .

 

First recipian is Hank Muller of
Potter. Iinnk gave up just two runs
and four hits in two games. He
struck out ten and only walked
eight. exhibiting good speed and
control.

The other pitcher is Jack Ormsbee
of SLS. Sporting an unusual dc-
livcry. Jack gave up seven hits in
his outing and walkch six.

These two men itlone kept the
scores from reaching fantastic
heights and deserve their tributes.

If the number of wildlife in this
area fails to decrease any in years
to come the four-footed creatures
can thank individuals such as those
found on the State College campus,
indirectly at least. Without a doubt,
they are safe in their confines if
the number of sportsmen on this
campus able to wield a rifle does
not exceed those active in the work-
ings of the State College Rifle Club.

Story Often Told

The story of the rise and decline
of the Rifle Club is an old one here

Just. what does the Rifle Club
lack? Well it has ammo and it has
a rifle range to practice on. It has
practically all supplies needed. They
can obtain rifles if they receive the
one big item it needs—someone to

How can the club serve you? If

Last Saturday at Bleecker Sta-
dium, the State baseball team in-
augurated the current season by
dropping a twin bill to Hartwick
College, 3-1, and 7-2.

The opener saw Dave Oakleaf
pitch eight innings of fine ball. only
to be rotited in the ninth and charg-
ed with the loss. The Feds were re-
tired iii order the first two innings.
The third saw the statesmen pass
up a. golden scoring opportunity.
With two down Oakleaf walked,
took second on Granados‘ single, and
went to third on Overton's infield

ed the rally by popping to the in-
field. After Devlin fanned in the
fourth. Howie Caldwell was hit by
a pitch and took second on Brett's
sacrifice. Sandy Bernstein sent the
lone State tally across with his
bingle to center but was put out

Threat Stopped

Another scoring opportunity de-
veloped in the sixth but strikeouts
by Devlin and Brett broke the
threat. The visitors also began to
stir in the sixth as they got a man
on with a free pass, and rode in on
Smith's long triple. Smith was later
put out in a run down and the side
was retired with the score tied. The
first visitor up in the ninth blasted
a long double. The next batter
promptly singled home his team-
mate. At this point. Oakleaf was
lifted and replaced by Davies who
got the first batter to ground out.

The last Hartwick run
