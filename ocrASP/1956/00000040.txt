News Views:

The veto of the farm bill by Pres-
ident Eisenhower has accomplished
two things politically. One: Eisen-
hower has taken the initiative in an
attempt to win the confidence of
the American farmer and Two: The
Democratic Party has achieved a
major goal, that of having Eisen-
hower enter the political arena per-
sonally. During the previous three
years Eisenhower has been above
the smoke and fire of the political
battles, while his subordinates have
shouldered the criticism directed at
the administration.

Eisenhower‘s bid for the conﬁ-
dence of the farmer is a powerful
one, only one that could be made
over a vast network of communica-
tions that is at the President's dis-
posal. The Democrats were expect-
ing a huge fire ﬁghting campaign to
douse the controversial farm issue
but Eisenhower's approach was sim-

portunity to attack Eisenhower per-
sonally on his farm bill veto. It is a
chance the Democrats have been
waiting for since Eisenhower gained
the Presidency.

Time and time again Democratic
attempts to criticize Eisenhower
have been rebuffed. The truth is
that often the Democratic forays
have gone astray resulting in more
harm to the Democratic party than
to the Republicans.

A majority of the Democratic
leaders were hesitant to use such
epithets as “Do Nothing President,"
“Seven Iron Ike” as advocated by
Harry Truman the noted “POLITI-
CAL WRITER?" The Democrats led
by Paul Butler. Democratic Nation-
al Chairman, realize now that they
must use all weapons at their dis-
posal to at least challenge Eisen-
hower. The turning to the use of
such petty tactics will result in only

ple and direct. It was a swift, bold. . n , , . ,
calculated move with one goal. PO_ one thing. Self Destruction.
liticai blackmail and Democratic
alibis on the farm crisis will not
sway the Republicans from their
objectives.

The Republicans want a quick
acting soil bank program with even-
tual abolishment of all supports. The
Democratic legislators on capitol hill
are on the spot and they know it.
The plan for their form of farm aid
is basically along the same lines as
the Republican plan. A rejection of
the Republican plan would mean
that they do not have faith in their
own plan.

The decisive manner in which
Congress upheld the farm veto can
only be attributed as a victory for
the administration. The House vote
which was 211 in support of the veto
as to 202 against, highlights the fact
that the Democrats could not even
win a simple majority in a Denic-
cratic controlled House! The crown-
ing blow was the $1,200,000,000 ap-
propriation voted to Eisenhower by
the House Appropriations Commit—
tee to put a soil bank plan into ef-
feet.

The Democrats now have the op-

don't know how things used to be.
but I do know that what our Stu-

come. is the resporiSibiliLy of each

for SA secretary.

Being in Rivalry activities and on
the State College News, I‘ve gottcn
to know a lot of you~ and the morc

serve you. From working with the
Constitutional Review Committee, I
know how the organizations of SA
are set up and how they work.

If you elect me. I can have a
share in making our student gov-
ernment better. This I would be
very proud to do.

By RICHARD BAUER

Mock Senate, originated by a stu-
dent at State College in 1951, held
its sixth session last Friday, Satur-
day and Sunday morning in the
chambers of the New York State
Assembly. Begun with the purpose
of encouraging the active participa-
tion of college students in state gov-
ernment and politics in general this
organization has grown from a
meager beginning at which only
eight schools wore represented to a
point where this year there were
twenty-three present.

Mock Senate is open to all colleges
in New York State no matter if they
are one year or graduate institu-
tions.

A Steering Committee guides the
various preliminary plannings need-
ed each year to assure success.

The function of this Senate par-
allels that of the regular State Sen-
ate. Each college is allotted four
representatives, or Senators. These
colleges, prior to the beginning .of
the session, draw up bills and reso-
lutions that they wish to have pass-

ed by the Senate.

The bills are introduced and sent
through committee and debated on
the floor with as much enthusiasm
as if they were actual laws.

This year’s session saw the rejec-
tion, by a substantial vote, of the
usual bill to eliminate Regents Ex-
aminations. In the field of adopted
legislation we find that it is the
desire of Mock Senate to: (1) legal-
ize off-track betting; (2) allow de-
ductions from the State income for
monies spent on higher education;
(3) allocate money to set up a bu-
reau to locate and guide gifted stu-
dents; (4) raise the pay of jurors;
(5) amend the Constitution to give
more proportional representation in
reference to election of delegates to
the State Constitutional Convention.

These bills after adoption do not
die however. They are sent to the
Governor and the heads of the vari-
ous committees of the legislature
they pertain to for consideration as
possible legislation by the real State
Government.
