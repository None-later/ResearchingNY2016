Trackmen Travel

For First Meet

RPI will be the scene of activity
for intercollegiate track this Satur-
day afternoon, and it will involve
the squad of Albany State College.
This is the first meet for the newly
formed Purple and Gold squad.
which is under the direction of Mer-
lin Hathaway, Director of Athletics.
State will be up against the fresh-
man team of RPI.

The strongest part of State’s
squad lies in track events. with
Gary Holway. Mike Flahive. John
Benton, Don Mayer, Ed Jones. and
Brian Mortensen holding key posi-
tions in the sprinting and running
events. In field. Dave Burroughs,
Dick Kotsi, Ron Alexander, Bill
Schwager. Bert Eckler, and Ed Kou-
bek head the list in shot putting,
discus, high jump, and pole vault.
Track Discussion Ends

The time has come now, when
discussion about whether or not
there is going to be a track squad
will have to cease. During the past
week. there was talk of just having
the field day on May 12. and hold-
ing off on competition for the time
being. The time has come now. and
Saturday will prove just what we
have in the track stock. There are
many bright spots on our squad.
and the RPI freshmen just might
have a tough time on their hands
when the Albanians invade Troy in
the pm. Saturday.

For those who backed the start
of track, it was a trying process in
getting the team organized. and
there were many moments of worry.
But the end-product is about ready
for competition and moments of
worry about organization are not in
the past, but less concentrated on
formation than on obtaining depth

Athletic Advisory Board Holds
Hearings On Preposed BudgetL

The State College Athletic Ad-
visory Board, after several months
of continuous work. has its 1956-57
intercollegiate sports budget ready
for presentation to the Student As-
sociation. After this presentation it
will then be turned over to Dr. Col-
lins for his consideration.

The Board has scheduled open
hearings next Wednesday and Thurs-
day night in Brubacher to give all
interested students the opportunity
to raise questions and air their feel-
ings. This is the only opportunity
that students will have to question
any of this year's proposed $18,758-90
budget. The Board therefore urges
all those interested to make their
presence shown at this time.

The proposed budget, broken down
into major line items, will be read
in assembly today and will be post-
ed in various places around school
Monday. Further breakdowns into
minor line items and individual ex-
penditures will be presented upon
request at the hearings which arc
slated to get under way at 7:30 pm.

is holding up the sale of this por—

part ol‘ the land, the major part.
which is owncd by a Mr. and Mrs.
Goodwin, is ready for sale as soon
(is the problcm of (he smullcr por~
Iiill is cleared up. The major par—
ccl consists of around 450 acrcs and
would cost about sixty-fch hundrcd
dollars. while the Sillillli‘i' scction

cost thc rcinuindcr of the original
$10,000 contract purchase pricc
which we are paying for the land.
It is impossible i'or us to buy just

Swen 364%

Eighteen thousand. seven hundred
and ﬁfty dollars is a lot of money.
This same quantity even when
divided by approximately two thou—
sand still yields quite a signiﬁcant
ﬁgure.

The result of the above computa-
tion may mean little to you now but
when next September rolls around
and you begin reaching for that
green medium of exchange it might
begin to take on more meaning.
The ﬁgure—whatever it might be—
will be your share in paying for the
intercollegiate athletic program next
year.

Who determined it'.‘ How was it
determined? What do you have to
say about it?

To begin with—for the benefit of
the 90"} who seemingly do not know
—the intercollegiate policies and
budget are handled by the State
College Athletic Advisory Board -a
group of three students and two
faculty members who make recom-
mendations to the President con-
cerning all affairs of athletic nature.

Work Four Months

'I‘hroughout the past four months
the group has been busy prcparing
next years budget. It is now ready
for presentation to Student Associa-
tion.

For this purpose the Board has
scheduled open hearings for next
Wednesday and Thursday nights at
7:30 1).”). in Brubnchcr. This is your
chance—your only chance—40 air
your feelings and ask questions.

As a member of the Board this
writer not only invites you. but

 

urges you to attend these hearings
and ﬁnd out just where the money
is going.

Ilow was this ﬁgure arrived at?
It was not pulled out. of a hat by
any means. Through close inspec-
tion of the last three years budgets
and a close watch of last year's in-
ventory, the Board was able to cut
all expenditures that seemed un-
necessary and bring the ﬁgure closer
to a more efﬁcient and economical
budget. To illustrate thiS—a new
sport~JV Soccer—.und a new group
‘Chcerlcaders were brought under
the Board's jurisdiction. These two
represent an increase of $1,184.00.
Yet through close calculations these
two were added with an increase of
only $250.00 over last year's budget.
Thus the Board's program is ex-
panding to meet the needs of the
increased enrollment and yet the
budget went. up only by this coni-
paraiiycly small amount.

Study the Budget

What can you do about it. ii' you
think the ilgiirc is unrealistic“? First.
study the proposed budget on Page
4. Formulate your questions and
request. line breakdowns at the
hearings. Fire your questions at the
Board.

If you're interested in sports, thcn
be at the hearin';s and tell us about
your ideas on the budget. If you're
not. then there is all the more rru—
son Why you should be there.

After all we're intcrostcd in how
we spend your money. The big
qucsiion is Are you‘.‘

conclusions but it looks like another

APA Wins
Kegling Traphy

The APA Bowling team proved
their might on the bowling alleys
once again as they came up with
their third straight loop win, down-
ing the KB team by the small mar-
gin of one game.

A big reason for the success of
the team was the presence of one
Al Stephenson who copped the in-
dividual crown with a 168 average.
He was followed by Dick Weinples
and Bernie Theobolds each hitting
166.

Stephenson Rolls 606

In individual performances Al
Stephenson had a high 606 triple.
Jim Lorrichio set the pace for the
high ten frame score as he split the
woods for a big 247.

up with the hottest day when they
rolled a 247i thirty frame tally. The

maining leaders in high marks with

Mario Scalzi who was routed in

Davie Goes Nine

In the Utica tilt, big Jerry Davie
toiled for the full nine giving up
eight hits, fanning ﬁve and walking
none. Randy Dudley supplied the
main batting power by smashing
two safties. Bob Devlin. Wayne
Overton. Bob Granados, Howie
Caldwell, and Sandy Bernstein col-
lected one hit apiece.

After the double defeat suffered
at the hands of Hartwick College,
the statesmen bounced back and
pulled out a victory over New Paltz.
The win was especially impressive
since the Peds had to overcome a
ﬁve run deficit in order to win.
Dave Oakleaf started the game for
the Peds but was sent to the show-
ers after working only 2 innings
and being nicked for ﬁve runs, and
eight hits. Jerry Davie came in,
put out the ﬁre, and pitched four
and a half innings of shut-out ball.
In earning the victory, Jerry gave
up only 1 hit and 3 walks. With 2
out in the seventh Coach Sauers
lifted Davie and sent in Howie
Caldwell who worked the rest of the
game giving up no runs, no hits,
while passing none.

The statesmen scored 1 in the
third. 1 in the fourth, and 3 in the
ﬁfth to tie the score. In the top
of the sixth Davie led off with a
single and was driven home with the
winning run on Sander’s safety.
The Albanians added another for
good measure in the seventh. Sandy
Bernstein garnered 3 hits and Bob
Devlin chipped in with 2.

Tomorrow the Sauersmen journey
north to Potsdam in hope of extend-
ing their streak.
