MUD Skit, "Play Ball," Features-

Struggling Albany Atomic: Team

Tonight at 8 pm. the curtain rises
on one of State’s greatest spectacu-
iarsi Baseball is all-important now
and so baseball is the keynote of
our show. Our title—Play Ball (an
original one by Dick Feldmani. The
story is about the struggling Albany
Atomics, the team from Albany
State College for Baseball. A hearty
Texas lad wanders up from the
Alamo, leaving his girl, to help the
team only to be tempted by Dolly,
the Romance Wrecker. Come and
see how it all turns out.

Show Features Well-Known Tunes

The show is full of well-known
tunes dressed up with new words.
To make it even more exciting to
watch, the boys on the ball team
perform a brilliant baseball ballet
to the tune of “Shoeless Joe From
The Alamo" which could easily
rival a professional number. Not
to be outdone by the team, the girls
come out in the second act and do
a quick and bright cheerleading
dance to "That's What's Called
Baseball." They are introduced by
some of the ballplayers singing the
song as they tell us just why base-
ball is important to them. In ad-
dition to these involved dance num-
bers, we ﬁnd many other sparkling
songs. The ﬁrst act contains “Play
Ball" in which our Texas gals try
to pull our Texas guys away from
the ball game on TV. Do they
succeed? You'll ﬁnd out. Act I
also contains “Heart” sung by mem-
bers of the ball team and their
manager. The ﬁnal song of this act
is “Joey Boy" in which our Ro—
mantic Wrecker tries to lead our
hero. Joe. astray. Act II opens with
“The Seventh Inning Stretch". a
salute to a famous baseball institu-
tion, sung by the singing and danc-
ing chorus with Mr. Wayne, the
owner of the Albany Atomics. Fol-
lowing this is the cheerleading
ballet. and then the ﬁnale “Say
Play Ball" presented by the entire
company. The set is simple anti yet,
we hope it will amuse you. Most of
the action takes place on the ball
park. You wonder what could be

amusing about such a set? We re-

peat. come and see.
