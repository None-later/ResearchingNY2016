A Tradition . . .

This year the News is celebrating its
Fortieth Anniversary. Founded in 1916, the
State College News has always been a leader
in Student Government and extra-curricu-
lar activities. It has been a leader sensitive
to progress.

Since November 4, 1916, the News has al-
ways come out on Friday. This has become
tradition which each editor has had to live
up to. It is a constant challenge but no one
has ever failed. Tomorrow, editors dating
back to 1918 will gather to honor the tradi-
tion of the News.

To many people on campus the News
Board is considered to be a close clique.
To a certain extent this is true. In order to
meet the challenge each week the members
of the News Board and staff work under
constant pressure to produce the newspaper
which you are now reading. There is no
glory in this work. What then keeps these
people working week after week? It is loy-
alty, loyalty to the tradition and the satis—
faction gained when you read your master-
piece on Friday. q

This feeling has been With every Board
and staff member of the paper. Without it
there would be no paper. It is this spirit
that we are honoring this weekend. We
welcome all the members of this tradition
to this fortieth birthday celebration.

It's Compulsory Now” . . .

The few people who were in Assembly last
week need not read this editorial, but the
majority of Student Association will need
to. The penalties motion for cutting con-
vocations, introduced by Myskania, _ was
passed by Student Association last Friday.
Beginning in the fall all students with as-
signed seats in Assembly will be required to
attend all legislative meetings of the As-
sociation. One absence will constitute a
warning from the seating committee, the
second will result in the removal of the
Pedagogue from the student tax card. For

each successive absence a student will be,

fined one dollar. This Motion has been
passed and goes into effect in September.

This time if you missed Assembly the
only person you hurt was yourself. We are
trying to make sure that from now on you
will have to be in Assembly to look out for
your own interests. Perhaps some day in
the future Convocations will be so well or-
ganized and interesting that students w111
attend because of this interest and no form
of compulsion will be necessary.

A Job Well Done . . .

Last Saturday night saw the results of
hard work, good leadership and constant
cooperation. This result was the Movmg—IUp
Day Skit which was evidence of the ex1st-
ence of these three qualities based on a
well written script. For this we pay tribute
to Richard Feldman who wrote the original
script and also directed the excellent chor-
eography for the skit. The cast worked
earnestly under the direction of Joan Gins-
burg. At this time, we offer our congratula-
tions to all.

The college Senior is almost automatically confer-
red with an attitude comprised of not a little awe and
a modicum of respect by the freshman. This is natural,
since the freshman may assume that the older and
more experienced person has used his talents to a
higher degree.

There seems to be a certain feeling at State that.
to the undcrelassman, Senior officers are virtually 1r-
reproachablo. while to the contemporary, the Senior
officer is the victim of the layman’s armchair quarter-
backing.

It is rare. then, than a Student Association Presi-
dent is held in high esteem by his classmates as by
by the underclassmen. Yet, such is the case this year:
and, perhaps. in this is a true testimonial of the ef-
fectiveness of Robert Betscha for his college.

Here is one leader who gave every indication of
being exceptional, even in the beginning. who not
only lived up to his promise here at State, but again
presents the promise of being an exceptional leader—
this time in a vastly more complex world.

Rather than list what Bob has done—his record
is its own testimonial—perhaps it can be said what
he has been for us.

Bob, has been a leader so intimately associated with
facts and faces at State this his experience, and the
knowledge gleaned from it never forsook him.

He has been a leader of matchless poise, unfailing
patience. gentle wit, and an honest devotion to his
obligations.

He has been that rare species of person that not
only used his own talents to the brink of their ca-
racity, but also—and perhaps of greater importance—
has possessed the ability to stimulate others to use
their distinctive talents to greater advantage of the
college and themselves. '

To Robert Francis Betsclia—a tribute of admiration,
respect, and confidence in all that he has been for
us—and will be for others.

No me who saw the excellent Moving—Up Day Skit went away
sorry. And it will be the same way with “Macbetii"~tiie only possible
difference is in the size of the audience. "Macbeth" will be one of the
best productions done at State in years. We've taken 21 cut now and then
at the general level of taste at State College. Here's your chance to
call us liars. We dare you to prove us wrong-sec "Macbeth": its dag-
gers an .1 witches and murders ire entertaining. It was written by some
guy who's done the book for :1 lot of movies.

y On Tradition initiated in 1916
Always Comes Out On Friday”

Class 01 1918 Originates idea
For Newspaper in Annual Skit

The history of the State College News is a full and
colorful one. As one browses through the files in the Pub-
lications Office which date back to 1916, he may well be
fascinated by the kalaidescopic material and structure
found in the News throughout the years.

The News was spawned on Moving-Up Day, May 4,
class stunt, the class of 1918
presented an allegorical Charade called “A Student’s
Dream." The play expressed the idea that the perfect
venture would be the creation of a college newspaper.

At that time there was no stu-
dent tax, and the main problem
lacing the students was a financial
one. The cost of one issue was found
to be about thirty-eight dollars. To-
day, one issue costs $173. Dr. Abram
Brubiicher. then President of the
College. was favorably impressed
with the skit and appointed a com-
mittee for the purpose of issuing a
newspaper. The name State College
News was chosen primarily because
of its briei'ness. The first issue ap-
peared on Friday. October 4. 1916.

The venture was financed with
the sale of subscriptions which sold
ior $1.50 a year. Advertisements
were not solicited for the first few
yours. A tiny room beneath the
steps of Old Draper was used as an
office.

Progress throughout the first
twenty-five years of the News was
notable. In 1917. the News wus in-
cluded under the blanket tax, thus
relieving many of the financial
worries. Change of type from the
original heavily headed print to the
clear type of today was :i major ini-
proveineiii.

One of the greatest editors in the
curliei‘ history of the News was Ed-
win Viin chcck of 1926—1927. Under
his iriiil-bliizing' guidance. the NeWs‘
earned its first Ail-Arncricaii rating".
He doubled the paper's advertising
income. used six-page. five-column
issues. extensive pictures. cuts. and
hints, :ind introduced rotogruvure
sections.

In 1941. the News celebrated its
twenty-fifth yczir of publication. At
this time. what was believed to be
the first eight—page issue was pre-
sented. By this yeur. the llltltt’l'illl
in the piipcr hud reached the point
ih.u exists in the current iSstleS.
ii'imlliiill news. uiid news of other
major sports no longer filled the
front pages. The emphasis. in con~
trust to the present, was on Greek
activities and cultural events rntlier
liiilli school politics.
