by BOB KAMPF

Spring has arisen, and the swampy
marshland commonly known as
Dorm Field commences to dry as
summer approacheth. The ump
shouts "play ball,” and eighteen so-
rority felines fix their lipstick,
straighten their hose, comb their
hair, and finally saunter gleefully
out onto the field, which is encircled
by the massive structures of student
housing (which will be used next
year). Once more is heard the
screams. hand clapping, and ohs
and ahs, as a Gamma Kappa star

AMIA Golfers
Start Tourneys

The AMIA golf enthusiasts will
soon begin their first of two spring
tournaments. First round compet-
ition will find an even dozen men
out there wielding the irons. and
aiming at the number one spot
which will be determined by May
15.

The winner of this tourney will
be awarded a trophy as will the
top man in the second 18 holes.

It is only at the second round
that the handicap system will be
used—the extra points being deter-
mined on the outcome of the first
round play. This round will end on
May 23.

Play At Turnpike Course

All games will be played on the
Western Turnpike Golf Course.

sons having the necessary trans-

crosses the plate with the fifteenth
run. A Beta Zeta serves up another
pitcher with her Walter Johnson de-
livery and a mighty Phi Delta takes
a Ted Williams cut. A Psi Gain stops
to grab a slow rolling grounder, then
throws her mitt down in disgust as
she watches the ball roll untouched
to the outfield grass. The sweet-
heart of Chi Sig (Barbi goes back
for a. long fly from the hat of a
Kappa Belt, and finds herself face
to face with the gymnasium win-
dow of Sayles Hall. Seeing her re-
flection. she stops to fix a loose
hairr, and readjusts her lipstick as
the runner rounds first and heads
for second. The outfielder notices
that she has a spot of tan turf on
her forehead, and takes a moment
to wipe it off. Having prettied her-
self up enough, she rifles the ball
into the shortstop on a line that is
only a hundred and eighty degrees
in flight, and the runner is declared
safe by the Sigma Phi umpire. The
result of which brings down the
Delta rains, and causes her to re-
consider her decision, After a ino-
ment of the highest contemplation,
she figures that since the ball was
misjudged by little Phyllis. the
runner should be declared safe. The
contests go on as the week pro—
grosses, as does the growth of spring,
the screams, hand clapping and ohs
and ahs of the feminine beauties
from the Houses of David. No great-
er love hath man than that of a
sweethear who can field a grounder
without getting a run in her Berk-
shire nylons. Sorority softball shall
not perish as long as there are
blonds, redheads, and dark haired
darlings to go snuntcring after that
clusivc bulk of soft covered string.

In like a lion and out like a lamb.
That just about describes the trend
of any IM league during its course
of play. When the leagues start
everyone is rarin‘ to go. Everyone
seems to boast how good he is.
The first game everybody plays
his heart out. Gradually this in-
terest decreases until forfeitures
seem to replace fully-played games.
Why? The following we believe are
some of the many small reasons
which taken together lead to a
poorly organized system. We strong-
ly urge next year's AMIA officers
to consider these in next year‘s
plans.

1. Less conflicting schedules. As
things stand now, there seems to
be a flood of sports at one time and
none at another. The solution here
would be to schedule such sports
as volleyball, badminton and golf
either in the seasonal lags or on
weekends. Going along Willi this

one day of the week should be set
aside strictly for postponed games.

2. More and better awards. Thouin
it varies in degrees, It's no secret
that everyone seeks at least some
small bit of recognition. Small
awards such as medals and patches
are not expensive. yet they would
do much to keep everone pushing.

3. Better record keeping. As things
are now once a team has copped a
loop, they begin to take things easy
while the other teams seem to give
up. Keeping better records and set-
ting up school records would give
these teams something to shoot at
over and above the league leader-
ship and they would not quit. try-
ing once the top slot has been de-
termined.

4. Less forfeitures. Any team for—
feiting two games should be dropped
from the league immediately. If
they don‘t show interest they
shouldn‘t be allowed to stay in the
loop.

5. Better publicity. Here is where
we are to blame. Because of a small
staff we have not been able to cover
the IM setup as would be desirous.

third point. If records are set up
then we can bring them in front. of
our reading public.

6. More AMIA officers. The bur-
den of all the AMIA .s‘ctup should

Perhaps, also, these all seem like
minute points and the accomplish-

a light but rather as a stop in the
right direction.

Trackmen Lose
Meet To RPI
In Away Meet

State was able to piece together
a thirteen man track squad last
Saturday, and headed for RPI to
race the RPI frosh. All was not in
vain as out of these thirteen men.
the Albanian team was able to gar-
nish one first place, three seconds,
and seven third places. Joe Barton
led the field of statesmen with a
first in the 880 at a clip of 2 min-
utes and 7 seconds. He also grab-
bed a second in the mile.

llolway, Jones, Mortensen Score
Gary Holway took two third
places in the meet. one in the high
Jump, and the other in the 220 low
hurdles. Ed Jones hit for a second
and a third in the 220 high hurdles
and broad jump respectively, and
Brian Mortensen placed twice, both
thirds, in the 220 and 440. All in
all. the statesmen took 24 points to
96 by the Engineers. The difference
was in depth as RPI put many more
men on the field. Those who scored
for State are as follows:

Last Saturday the State baseball
team was handed a 23-19 loss in an
away game with Plattsburgh. The
Statesmen scored 1 in the second.
3 in the third, 2 in the fourth, and
7 in the fifth. At this point the
Feds were winning by a. 13 to 7
margin. Howie Caldwell was called
into relieve Jerry Davie in the bot-
tom of the fourth and promptly put
out the fire. In the fifth Howie fan-
ned the side. In the sixth the Feds
added 3 runs, but in the bottom of
the frame the Northmen exploded

Sports Mailbox:

Apathy Runs Rampant;

Statesmen Dor 't Run

To the Sports Editor:

Due to the lack of interest on the
part of the men here at State, track.
a hopefully conceived sport, has
dwindled to a mere nothing. The
interest radiated by the small nu-
cleus of men, who readily engaged
in practice, has not been enough to
counteract the apathetic attitude
of those who like to see their name
hanging in the Draper peristyie on
a sign-up sheet. Money was appro~
printed, equipment bought, and an
adequate, even if not elaborate
training area provided. All that was
lacking was interest and participa-
tion on the part of a few pseudo—
:ilhlclcs who boasted how good they
wcre in high school but were not
confident enough to prove their ab-
ility in competition. There is a songr
title that is appropriate for those
who inked their names on the
sign-up shoot, but didn't comply,
and it goes like this, "Are You Sat—
isl’icd?“ Tennis, anyone?!

for 8 big runs, making the score 16
to 15. The Sauersmen failed to score
in the top of the seventh while the
home team pushed across 4 more
tallies, making the score 19-16 in
favor of Plattsburgh. The Feds add-
ed one ln the eighth and 2 in the
ninth to end the Albany scoring.
However, the home team garnered
4 more in the eighth to gain the
winning margin. Davie worked 3
innings and was touched for 5 runs,
walked 3, and fanned 1, while giv-
ing up 5 hits. Howie Caldwell toil-
ed 4 innings and was racked for 10
hits, 11 runs, fanning 8 and pass-
ing 3. Dave Oakleaf worked 1 in-
ning. giving up 4 hits and 4 runs,
while walking none and fanning 1.
Bob Fierro and Ken Brett led State
in the hitting department with 7
and 6 hits, respectively.
Down Sicna

On Monday, the Sauersmen in a.
7 inning tilt wasted a strong Siena
“9” by a 10-9 margin. Mario Scalzi
not only gained the pitching vic-
tory but knocked in 6 of State’s
tallies. Marie was relieved in the
seventh with State winning 10-6.
Howie Caldwell was nipped for 3 in
the last of the seventh but held off
the rally and finished strong. The
victory pushed State's record to a
4-3 mark.
Potsdam Belts Peds

Wednesday the Feds were belted
to the time of 17-3 by a mediocre
Potsdam  Starter Dave Oak-
leaf retired the visitors with no
trouble in the first but the roof fell
in during the second as they scor-
cd 8 big runs, a deficit which State
could not overcome as Potsdam
added runs in each inning but the
6th and 8th. Oakleaf took the loss,
State's fourth against four vic-
tories. while Sandy Bernstein, Bob
Devlin, and Bob Ficrro collected 4
hits apiece in the losing cause.
