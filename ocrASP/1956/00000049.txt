By HELENE GOLDA

This past Tuesday night in the
last program for the semester of
the Evening of Readings from Lit-
erature series, the Oral Interpreta-
tion of Drama Class presented their
production of Graham Greene's
“The Living Room,” under the direc-
tion of Agnes E. Futterer, Professor
of English. After a. brief but very
helpful introduction by Maxine Ad-
ner, the performance began.

Members of the class participating
in the presentation of this provoca-
tive play were Maxine Adner as
Mary, the servant; Tom Smith as
Michael Dennis, a middle-aged psy-
chologist; Marie Devine as Rose
Pemberton, the young girl with
whom Michael is in love; Karol Clif-
ford as Rose's Aunt Teresa Browne;
Marilyn Erter as her Aunt Helen;
William Gardner as Father James
Browne, their invalid brother, who
is also a. Catholic priest; and Ruth
Kapela as Mrs. Dennis, Michael’s
estranged wife.

Although Miss Adner's part was
very small, she was careful to make
it an integral part of the produc-
tion and not just a meaningless ad-

ditlon. Tom Smith gave a stimu-
lating performance—sustained, pow-
erful, and convincing. With match-
less control and smoothness, Wil-
liam Gardner sympathetically de-
veloped the character of the useless,
invalid priest. In her expert and
expressive manner, Marie Devine in
her interpretation of Rose, reached
a high performance level. Marilyn
Erter, with her marvelously expres-
sive face and eyes, created a vil-
lainous and yet pitiful Aunt Helen.
Ruth Kapela worked for and
reached just the right peak of emo-
tional hysteria in her brief but im-
portant appearance. And last, but
not least, Karol Clifford convincing-
ly created Aunt Teresa as an elder-
ly, dominated person who yet had
reserves of strength—no mean ac-
complishment.

The performance as a whole, as
I have implied in my brief indivi-
dual criticism, was excellent. The
mendously effective climaxes. The
tempo was at all times right and
geared to the production of the high
level of tension which was attained
