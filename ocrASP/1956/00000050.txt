Work Starts At
Student-Owned
Camp Dippikill

We now have. a College Camp.
Last year Student Association voted
to purchase a tract of land at
Warrensburg. New York. which is
to be developed by the students for
their use. According to David Hart-
ley. Dean of Men and faculty mem-
ber of the College Camp Board, the
deed to the land was cleared this
summer and the final purchase was
made for a total of ten thousand
dollars from Student Association
surplus.

At the time of purchase the only
dwelling on the property was an old
farm house. During the week of
September fourth. a work party of
fifteen. consisting of faculty and
students. began work on developing
the property. The group set up
temporary headquarters at the
farmhouse and began development
in this area. The farmhouse was
cleaned and painting was started.
A refrigerator and gas stove were
installed. The group also construct-
ed ﬁve tent platforms which will
accommodate three people each.

The well has been pointed up

Endless Summer Grind Ends,-
- - - - Laughing Return To State

By A lt'l‘ PLOTN l K

l walk the halls for the hundreth
time during the day, and I laugh. i
open new text books and laugh
again. i look at freshmen beaiiies.
posters on the walls. familiar faces.
the cafeteria, and faculty members,
amt I lauin and chuckle again. Not
that familiar faces and faculty
members are anything to laugh at-w
not this early in the year. I laugh
because it's good to be back, and
that's funny.

When I think of how I ran out of
here in June, like a maiden running
from ii madman; how l ran away
from those sickening text books and
bennics and posters and fares and
the rest, my brain dilutes, my eyes
water, my mouth frotlis, and I howl
an inconsistent. fiendish, and mac-
abre howl. And all because no mat-
ter how you scratch and bite and
kick and try to fight it, it's good to
be back. it’s an undefined, highly
illogical sensation. but it’s unmis-
takably present.

Here at State. one finds his own
kind of people. The humble and
the homely, and the proud and the
profane. A wonderful bunch of
frustrated hoods trying to make
good in the world of hard knocks.
It's good to be back.

Perhaps it’s only a temporary
sensation, in fact it is undoubtedly
so, but nevertheless the joys derived
from the brief moments of “being
back“ are eternal in their unforget-
tableness. It is extremely unfortun—
ate that the freshmen cannot ex—
perience the thrills of returning to
State, but then. many of them will
experience it six or seven times be-
fore they arc through.

It couldn't be that l‘in completely
insane. Surely others must be glad
to be back . . . but it was a iiiaddeii-
ing summer . . . and I do get spells
of" insecurity . . . and those frequent
headaches. . .aiid hallucinations. . . .
