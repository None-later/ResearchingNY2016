By ANN RIDLEY

A bit of philosophy for the in-
coming frosh:

There was a Joe College

Who went by the rule -

That it wasn’t for knowledge

That he went to school.

He loafed at the Grill and

He went out for sports.

He joked with free will and

Was ne’er out of sorts,

He never cracked books . . .

“Me study? Why I'll

Get by on my looks,"

He’d say with a smile.

And he did for a. while . . .

This jovial Joe

Got by on his smile

Wherever he’d go.

But then came semesters.

With hopes to get through

He smiled at the testers,

Poor Joe’s Waterloo.

His smilw didn’t save him

(Except to save face.)

The questions they gave him

He flunked without grace.

College career dead now.

He boasts, but I fear

The stone at his head now

Relates it quite clear:

"There was a Joe College

Who went by the rule

That it wasn’t for knowledge

That he went to school."

Ye seekers of knowledge,

I warn you, “Don't laugh.

Don’t you finish college

With Joe’s epitaph.”

(from The Keystone)

A quip from the Central Michi-
gan Life:

A student at the University of
North Dakota tried to renew a loan
from the college before he regis-
tered for the second semester. The
business office, hOWever, said that
he must register first.

When he tried to register in or-
der to renew his loan, he was in-
formed that he couldn't get back
in school until the loan was paid
. . so goes modern education.

From The Anchor come:
poem:

You can tell the green freshman
By her look of great alarm.

this

You can tell the smooth sophomore
By the way she oozes charm.

You can tell the jolly junior

By her manner, dress, and such.
You can tell the serious senior

By the man held in her clutch.

[Oswego Conference Measures Teacher's Role;

State Delegate Discusses?Pending Legislation

By cums PAYNE

The Oswego Workshop Confer-
ence was held at Oswego Teachers
College August 26-29. The confer-
ence was under the direction of the
New York State Teachers Associa-
tion and was attended by the heads
of the local teacher associations
along with a representative from
each of the eleven state teachers
colleges. The topic of the confer-
ence was Advancement of Profes-
sional Competence: of the Teach-
er, Of the Profession, Of the Asso-
oiations.

Competence of the Teacher:

It is a difficult task to sit down
and come up with a suitable defini-
tion of a competent teacher. Measure
of a Good Teacher published by
the California Teachers Association
gives the most acceptable yardstick
of a competent teacher. It states
a. teacher must be competent in

Competence of the Profession:

The following are some generally
accepted criteria of what consti-
tutes a profession.

A profession renders a unique
service to society. The teaching pro-
fession in New York State meets
most of the criteria of a profession
except it does not control its
standard of preparation and admis-
sion. It is for this reason that the
NYSTA is in the process of pre-
paring the Professional Practices
Act which would become a. law of
New York State. Under this not
each teacher applying for a license
in the state of New York would be
examined by a state board of ex-
aminers who would review to see if
an applicant is at least 20 years
of age. is of good moral character,
has completed 4 years of high
school, and has completed the
course of study in and holds the
diploma of a teacher prcpuring lll-

a list would be published of all
teachers properly registered and il-
censed in the state. The Commis-
sioner would have the power to
revoke and suspend licenses upon
recommendation of a state board on
a charge made by any person, cor-
poration or public official.

This Professional Practices Act
is still being worked upon by the
Association and probably will not
come before the legislature until
some time elapses. It is important
to us as prospective teachers to be
aware of proceedings dealing with
this act, Already such questions
have been raised as, will now tcach-
ers be allowed to tcuch undcr the
act, and is the state rcady for such
an act?

Future Teachers of America

Often F. T. A. is only associated
with high school groups, but F. T.
A. also has a nationnl college unit
which in 1954 had 528 colleges bc—

ing' a slate unit of the college F. T.
A. This would mean that Albany
could form an F. T. A. chapter
Icrc on campus. The ices per per—
son would be no more than $2.50.
and it would cniitlc student mem—
bership into the NYSTA and the
National Education Association
with oil of their monthly publica-
tions. Anyone enrolled in the col-
lcgc would be eligible to join, and
no academic rcquiremcnis would
have to be met.

The usual news of the arctic
weather, the rain and the food at
Frosh camp took a back seat this
year as everyone witnessing the
frosh—counselor softball game began
buzzing about the big feat of one
Dave Burroughs. The accomplish-
ment that set their vocal chords in
action was the 630 foot homer (in-
cluding the roll plus the return trip)
laced out by the Belting Bantam-
State‘s answer to the Mick and his
tape measure jobs.

Strikes Out

Somewhat irked by being caught

Ancient Athletics
Conquer Frosh

Between the stormy weather of
Friday night and Saturday night at
the Men's Frosh Camp weekend. the
traditional Faculty-Frosh softball
game was played with the infallible
instructors coming out on top as
per usual. 2-0. Dr. Lemon allowed
only two hits as he went the ﬁve
inning distance for the prancing
pedagogues.

In the second inning, the squad of
freshmen were under the illusion
that the umpires were favoring the
faculty, as they allowed the “young—
cr" men to score the deciding two
tallies. Coach Hathaway pulled a
surprise by pushing a neatly placed
bunt up the third base line to lead
off the inning. He surprised the
frosh pitcher, Dick Call, so much.
that Call lost complete sight of the
plate, and “walked” the next two
batters to load the socks. A hit over
second base. which by more chance
hit the second base umpire and
rolled back onto the inﬁeld grass,
allowed Coach Hathaway and Dr.
Gibson to score the deciding runs.
Lose Will To Win

Once the fresh were behind, they
lost all incentive to win. Thcy didn't.
even swing at perfect strikes which
either bounced over the plate or
flew over their heads. When they
did get hold of one of Lemon’s drops
or highballs. Coach Sailors seemed
to be in the way, and made some
beautiful stops at his third base
position to throw them out. Richard
Call and Lee UpCraft handled the
pitching for the frosh. _

So with sore muscles and aching
backs, the so far “undefeated” fa-
culty walkcd ovcr .inothcr freshmen
softball team. and we do mean
walked.

rapher Bill Gillette‘s camera as he
went down swinging in an earlier
frame (See picture) the slugger re-
taliated by stepping into the box
with the score tied at 4-4 in the
bottom of the seventh. After letting
two go by, and after he sent one
screeching out to the left ﬁeld re—
tuining wall, he gleefully made his
way around the base paths. Need—
less to say the Bronx jeers turned
to cheers as the counsellors emerged
victorious by a 5—4 count.

Faculty Win——Again?

The faculty of course upheld an—
other of dear ole State‘s traditions
by again downing the helpless frosh,
even though, as the newcomers will
readily admit. the umps were lean-
ing toward the younger team all the
way.

Never the ones to be outdone in
color thc ancient athletes even went
so far as to bring in their own trio
of chccrlcudcrs who led a group of
v o c i f c r o u s uppcrclassmcn. The
female contingent was decked in
bluc (lun‘iurccs' and variety of color-
cd jackets.

Are You One?

The call out by Joe Garcia for
new soccer players is not one to be
ignored by those of you who possess
the interest but wonder about the
talent. Each year the coach finds
four or live reluctant, potential
bonotcrs like yourself and umler his
tutelage they have left their name
printed on all the local sports pages.
Several even have gained slate-wide
recognition by being named to the
All-State soccer squad. Why not
give it a try‘.’ The only thing you
have to lose is that doubt in your
mind as to whether or not you can
make the grade,

This—the ﬁrst issue of the ycar-
becomes the last for this writer in
the position of Sport’s Editor. To
my succcssor—-—to be chosen at the

the best of luck and sincerely hope
that you may achieve those goals
that this one has always strived to
attain.

Thirteen Veterans Lead Soccer

Squad In Two Daily Workouts

Beverwyck Field, scene of grade
school softball action for the past
three months, again became subject
to the heavy trampling of soccer
cleats as Coach Joe Garcia and his
soccer men began workouts last
Wednesday afternoon.

Returning to the Washington Ave.
scene of practice were thirteen let-
termen including six seniors. Join-
ing the stalwarts were six frosh,
eleven upperclassmen and one
transfer to give Garcia a thirty-one
man crew as of now.

Bonestcel Back

Leading the local boaters in their
first scheduled game a week from
tomorrow will be Co-captain Bill
Bonesteel. Bill, who took a trip to

 

  

(‘Al'GllT

the altar this summer, will start
his second year as co-captain. His
partner at the helm of the Garcia-
meii will be goalie Tito Guglielmone.

Despite the fact that Garcia must
suffer the problem of most of his
men returning out of shape, several
bright spots can be noted in this
year's makeup.

Maxson's Spirit Best

Carl Maxson, a ﬁrst string All-
state booter last year, returned in
excellent condition and is showing
the spirit that won him the award.

Dave Call, a natural athlete who
possesses no soccer experience, is
forcing Garcia to crack a smile be-
hind that big cigar. by showing
great coordination.

 

under the NEWS camera as he goes down swinging is

Dave Burroughs who later retaliated as he broke up the Frosh-(‘oun-
sclor game wrih :1 home rim at li‘rosh Camp. The frosh receiver awaits
the ball and a hearty laugh at the big counselor.

Another factor that is making the
mentor breathe a little easier dur-
ing the two daily workouts is the
presence of North Rose's Tom Ful-
ler. Tom. a booter who was below
par in his freshman year and left
State for two years, returns this
year a 100"} improved ballplayer.

Hickey Injured

Another product of North Rose—
Joe Hickey was showing much of his
two years high school experience in
soccer until he injured his instep
Wednesday morning.

Sophomore Don Makely. perform-
ing on the outside left position and
Paul Dammer booting them from
the fullback slot are also expected
to be a great asset to the Feds this
year.

Garcia has expressed hope that a
JV squad might be formed this year
with Rebel Hockmuth. a grad of last
year at the helm.

More men are needed and the
welcome mat is out for anyone in-
terested in playing. Garcia has
strongly emphasized the point that
no experience is necessary. “It is
an excellent chance for anyone to
get acquainted with the game" he
stated. Anyone possessing the desire
to take a crack at the fast growing
sport is urged to contact the coach
immediately.

All home games this year will be
played at Blocker Stadium located
on Partridge and Clinton Street,
Just a few blocks north of Brubach-
er.

Scrimmage Wednesday

A scrimmage will be held Wednes-
day at Williams. Because of the
lack of space the complete soccer
schedule will appear in next week's
issue of the News.
