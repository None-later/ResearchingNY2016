From the Ithacan come wise
words of Confucius, “Man who write
for living, may end up eating
Words.”

If State frosh think they have
trouble with beanies, hear this.
Adelphi frosh must also carry
matches, not cigarette lighters, for
all upperclassmen.

A bit of poetry from RPI:

I think that I shall never see,

A girl refuse a meal that's free,

A girl whose hungry eyes aren't
fixed

Upon a drink that's being mixed,

A girl who won’t forever wear

A batch of junk to match her hair,

A girl not after boys all day,

Devising ways to make them pay.

But girls are loved by fools like me,

’Cause who the heck wants to kiss
a tree.

Some gems from the State Signal:
Hickory, Dickery, Dock
The mouse ran up the clock,

The clock struck one,
And bashed his brains out.

You can accomplish anything if
you have patience. You can even
carry water in a sieve if you wait
until it freezes.

An ingenious Kansas University
student, seeing the long receiving
line at a tea, slipped his right arm
out of his coat sleeve, buttoned his
coat, and stuck the empty sleeve
in his pocket.

From the Clarkson Integrator a
few pearls of wisdom.

A dog may be man's best friend,
but did you ever try to borrow
money from a dog?

Discussion may be defined as the
beginning of an argument.

It’s a funny world. Remain silent,
and others suspect you are ignor-
ant; talk, and you remove all doubt
of it.

A bus is a public conveyance that
has just gone by.

A family man is one who has sev-
eral small mouths to feed and one
big mouth to listen to.

sitting job for $3 and wound up

James Loricchio ’58, Lab Assist-
ant for the mimeograph room, an-
nounces the rules concerning the
use of this room by college organ-
izations.

Only those students who have
completed Commerce 15 A or B are
automatically qualified to use the
room. For those individuals who
feel that they are capable to use
the machines a test will be given
Thursday. This test will be posted
on the door Monday so candidates
can see just what they are required
to know. Instructions will be given
by Donald Mulkerne, Associate Pro-
fessor of Commerce, and Loricehio
from Monday to Thursday from 3 to
5 pm. for those people who wish
to refresh their knowledge of the
use of the machines.

SUNY, can expect to be recognized
as a strong backboned institution,
we have the duty of recognizing
ourselves as the whole of SUNY
and becoming familiar with and a
part of our member colleges.

I, therefore, propose that an an-
nual weekend be set up which any
and all students would be eligible
to attend. Thereby unifying SUNY
into a stronger and more direct or-
ganization, strength and purpose
would be given to the individual
colleges, minimizing the apathetic
attitude and banishing "paper or-
ganization."

209 CENTRAL AVENUE

“Eisenhowerl’” Will the name
spark the Republicans to victory in
the House of Representatives as it
did in 1952? This is the question
that faces both Republican and
Democratic strategists in the cur-
rent campaign for control of the
lower house of Congress.

The Democrats say no but they do
not deny that the threat is there.
They defend their view by pointing
to their 1954 congressional and gub-
ernatorial victories. They point out
that their net gain of 15 seats in the
House plus the “courthouse control"
gained through victories in many
local elections should offset any
advantage gained for the Republi-
cans by having Eisenhower on the
ticket this year. The Democrats are
basing their hopes for victory on the
superior organization work of regis~
tering and getting voters to the
polls. The power of this "grass
roots" drive was aptly demonstrated
by their Victories in the Maine
election.

The Republicans are pinning their
hopes for victory on the inﬂuence of
the Eisenhower name. They hope it
wil once again bring out a tide of
November votes that will help carry
their congressional candidates to
victory in the dangerous marginal
districts. The Republicans need a
net gain of 15 seats in order to wrest
control of the house from the
Democrats.

The marginal areas of which there
are 95 are the districts where can-
didates were elected by less than
55'; of the vote in a particular
district. Small shifts percentage-
wise will spell Victory or Doom for

either party seeking control of the
house.

The country can be broken up
into three sections concerning the
problem of marginality. They are
the East Coast, Mid—West and Far
West. In the East there are no less
than 38 seats in 13 states that are
in the marginal category. These
coupled with the two in Maine com-
pose one-half of the marginal dis-
tricts and over one-third of the
total seats in the House. The major
issues in this torrid battleground
will be foreign policy, economic
policy and segregation.

In the Mid-West the problem fac-
ing both parties is how to please
two powerful conﬂicting ‘voting
blocs. the farmer and organized
labor. The Democrats blast Benson
with his soil bank program and cry
that the Republicans exploit the
little fellow. The Republicans
counter with the theme of peace,
prosperity and progress. The major
question here however is, how will
the voter respond to the Eisenhower
administration?

In the Far West which has been
predominantly Republican for years,
the major battle will concern not
House seats but whether the Admin—
istration has the power to unseat
the turncoat. Wayne Morse. Major
battles for marginal House seats
will be in California.

The win or lose decisions con-
cerning many marginal districts will
be settled in the urban and subur-
ban parts of these districts. Should
the Democrats win these, there
would be trouble for the Repub-
licans no matter who wins the
Presidential election.

Crazy Contests Oiier Cool Cash;
Shave Your Beard On Television

Stop complaining about money,
and listen carefully. There are
three college contests running right
now, each offering enough money
to buy and sell State College. It's
an established fact that college kids
are clever, are good judges of human
nature, and can grow beards. These
qualiﬁcations are all that is required
to win this bread ﬂoating around.

Reader's Digest is offering a ﬁrst
prize of ten thousand dollars for
anyone who can predict the six
articles that will be most popular
in the October issue. This prize
consists of ﬁve thousand for your-
self, and ﬁve thousand toward your
college education. This is where we

prize and LIVE.

The second contest is most inter-
esting. Ronson is offering ﬁve
thousand dollars for every ounce of
your heard that they shave on their
television show. You must be over
twenty-one, and your beard must be
three months old. If you're a female
and have a good beard, well . . . why
not forget the whole thing? To
enter this contest it is requested
that you send a strand of your
board into the Ronson Company.
You‘d better insure it if you think
anything of it—ﬁve thousand an
ounce, you know.

The third contest is sponsored by
Lucky Strlke cigarettes. and re-
quires clever two-word rhymes in
answer to your own simple riddle.
The ad appears in this paper fre-
quently. Twenty-ﬁve bills each;
enough to buy 100 Luckies. twenty-
iiyc meals, or the mayor of the city.

Slate Activities

Two religious clubs on campus,
the Lutheran Student Association
and Canterbury Club, are planning
meetings and social events.

Edward Van Amerongen, presi-
dent of the Lutheran Student As-
sociation, announces that the group
will hold a reception at St. John's
Lutheran Church, 180 Central Ave.,
Sunday at 5 pm. The theme of the
program is “Kick-off to Autumn".
Supper will be served.

Mr. Daniel Uzupan from Gettys-
burg Seminary is the association's
adviser. Their plans for the semes-
ter include discussions on the Bible's
meaning today and a square dance
with the Rensselaer Polytechnic In-
stitute Lutheran Association. The
repenrinf g of toys for children at the
Albany Home and a post-Christmas
visit to the Home are also on the
calendar.

David Goldberg. president of Can-
terbury Club, announced their pro-
gram for Sunday night will include
round and square dancing. The
highlight of the evening will be a
spaghetti dinner beginning at 6 pm.
This will be held at the Cathedral
Guild House. Students may sign up
for transportation on the Canter-
bury bulletin board in Lower Husted.

Varsity Kegiing
Tryouts Begin

With the fall sports hardly under
way, States keglers are jumping the
gun a little as they issue the call for
all those interested in trying out
for the varsity bowling team.

The procedure to be used in se-
lecting the ﬁrst weeks roster is as
follows:

All aspirants are to bowl two
three-game sets at Rices Bowling
Alleys before this Monday.

Scores are to be handed in to the
manager of the establishment lo-
cated on the corner of Western and
Quail Streets.

Bowl Intercollegiateiy

Those compiling the highest aver-
age for six games will be selected
for ﬁrst week competition in the
Intercollegiate Bowling League.

The remainder of tryouts may
still land a berth on the varsity
group by continuing to bowl each
week and handing their scores to
the manager. Averages will then be
compiled cumulatively until a sub-
stantial number of games are turn-
ed in.
