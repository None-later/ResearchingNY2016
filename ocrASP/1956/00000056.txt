by BOB KAMPF

Before wading into the sports of
State, we’d like to dedicate a few
lines of this column to our friend
Joe and his Milwaukee Braves. They
made a tight race out of the Na-
tional League, Joe. But we told you
there would be another pennant
flag shifting in the breeze around
Flatbush Avenue again this year.

World Series Opens

Now that the pennant races have
come to ﬁnal standings, and four-
teen teams are starting their winter
vacations; the classic of baseball,
the World Series, has opened where
we predicted it would, in Ebbets
Field. By the standards of the base-
ball odds, the Yankees may be
favorites, but we’re sticking with
the Flock from Flatbush in at least
six games.

AMIA Opens Football Season

With schedules planned and teams
organized, the AMIA is off to a
touchdown start with its annual
football league. This year presents
a different picture of the league
situation because there is only one
league instead of two. We are in-
clined to be in favor of this set up
because, though it may not give
each team an equal chance due to
lack of material and team depth.
it gives each team a chance to meet
all the other organized teams, and
thus determine the real college
champs. By having such a league
there is more chance for upsets and
a greater chance for more interest-
ing play. The team with the best
record will naturally be the college
champion and no one will be able
to dispute the fact.

Intercollegiate Idea

The league this year is set up on
the idea of something like a minia-
ture intercollegiate conference, such
as the Ivy League. Each team meets
one another only once, and the win-
ner is decided on overall record only.

This idea seems pretty good to
us, especially since there are only
eight teams. By taking these eight
teams apart, and putting four in
one league and the remnants in a
second league, the round robin play
which results does not present the
variation that this year's league will
present. Of course, last year’s play-
offs were run exceptionally well. but
this year's play will give us a high-
ly different type of play. and we be-
lieve the action will be all the
greater. One reason for this is that
with this year's setting there will be
twenty-eight games instead of the
eighteen that were played in the
two leagues last year. Include the
play-offs of last year and you still
only have twenty-four games. So.
you can see that there will naturally
be a lot more action this year.

Beverwick Field Faulty

Another factor which proved de-
trimental last year was the playing
field on Beverwyck. What with a
hard baseball diamond extending on-
to the playing area and the Amazon
swamp regions that the teams play-
ed in on that ﬁeld, it is no wonder
that not more than one player went
to the hospital with a broken nose.
Dorm Field, of course, has its faults,
but it is not nearly as faulty as
Beverwlck. So, we wish good luck
to this year's league and for all
those participating in it.

A Point About Referees

The guys who are giving up their
tline to ofﬁciate at league games are
not professionals. There will be bad
calls, no doubt, but let’s not add to
their troubles by climbing on their
backs too much.

Softball For '59 and ‘60

Tomorrow morning opens the sea-
son on rivalry contests, so let’s see
all you Gremlins and Yellow Jackets
out on Dcrm Field bright and early.

Tennis Players
Start Fall Ploy

From the AMIA bulletin board
this week comes the announcement
that the fall golf and tennis tour-
naments are beginning to get under-
way. Both of these are portions of
a series of intramural sports touma-
ments which will be run off
throughout the year.

Tennis Is Furthest Advanced

The sign up sheet for all those
interested in fighting their way to
Forest Hills is already up and sign-
ed by some twenty men. This tour-
nament will be run under the lead-
ership of Paul Erickson ’59, and
should get underway very shortly
so that matches can be played be-
fore bad weather sets in. All
matches will be played on the
Washington Park courts. A time
will be arranged with the partici-
pants as to what time and day the
matches will be played.

Golf To Be Played 0n Weekends

As soon as enough interest is

shown and all names have been
compiled on the sign up sheet, the
golf tournament will get underway.
All matches will be played on week-
ends unless time permits on week-
days. This year’s tournament will
probably be the same as last year,
whereby a straight score for handi-
cap round will be played first. Then
the Sneads and Hogans will play
a handicap score to determine the
winner. Here's a chance for you
AMIA members who like the open
air to get out and enjoy yourselves
on the fairways and greens. The
sign up sheet in lower Draper by
the men's locker room awaits your
signature.

intramural Golf, Football League Opens,-

Vets Top College Heights

By NORM

The intra-mural football league
got under way Wednesday with the
Vets trouncing College Heights, 19-0.

Bobby Granados was the offensive
star for the winners, running for
one touchdown and passing for an-
other. The ﬁrst score came in the
first period on a pass from Ron
Webb, who equalled Granados’ ef-
forts, to Connie Schmidt. In the
third period, a Granados to Webb
pass netted the Vets their second
TD, and the former ran for the
ﬁnal score in the fourth quarter.
Set Up Rules

On Tuesday evening the commis—
sioners, Russ Hall, Dave Burroughs
and Bob Sisco met and set up the
league and the rules. There are
eight teams, Vets. Humps. APA,
SLS, Potter, KB, Sayles, and College
Heights, all in one league. They will
play each other once with no play-
offs. The winner will be based on
a point system; two points for a win.
one for a tie, one half off for a for-
feit or failure to hand score sheets
in on time. All the games will start
at 4:15 on Dorm Field. The forfeit
time is 4:30. The coordinator of
ofﬁcials is Dick Causey.

Junior Varsity
Soccer Squad
Start Tomorrow

Due to a large turnout of soccer
candidates Coach Joe Garcia has
announced that a junior varsity
booter squad will be in operation
this season. The opening game for
the new group will be against Al-
bany Athletic Club immediately fol-
lowing the varsity game against
Geneseo tomorrow.

Rebel To Coach

The Junior Peds, already having
the schedule below drawn up, will
have ex-varsity booter Manfred
"Rebel" Hockmuth at the helm.

The short (five foot five inch)
grad who hauls from Wappingers
Falls will assist Garcia in his con-
tinuous quest for a bigger and bet-
ter soccer squad.

Rebel begins his coaching career
with seven years of soccer experi-
ence behind him. After donning a
booter uniform for Wappingers
Central for four straight years, the

There are two less teams than last

To the Sports Editor:

Where, oh where are the verdant
freshman GIRLS? This is the cry
from WAA Council and the sports
managers. By now you are tired of
sitting in stuffy classrooms so take
advantage of a fine opportunity to
get some exercise. Come out for
hockey or soccer or both. The man-
agers started having practices this
week after school on Dorm Field.
These will continue throughout the
fall season. Let's have at least
eleven girls there in case Russell
Sage, Skidmore, Green Mountain
or Saint Rose invites us to partici-
pate in a sports playday.

Freshman girls and upperclass-
women are all asked to keep Sat-
urday, October 20, an open date.
Pros-h Frolic, WAA’s annual recep-
tion for freshman women (upper-
classwomen are invited to come and
relax for the day) will be held out
at Camp Johnson on that day.
Transportation, food, entertainment
—-all free. All you girls will have to
do will be to sign up on the WAA
bulletin board the week before
Frosh Frolic. All girls at State are
invited.

onesteel, Guglielmone

Former Serves
As Leader For

Second Season

When talk centers around sports
at State, it becomes hard not to
mention soccer and when soccer is
mentioned it‘s inevitable that the
names of Bill Bonesteel and Tito
Guglielmone will pop up. For all
practical purposes all three are syn-
onymous.

Bonesteel, the five foot. eleven
inch blonde from Cairo. N. Y., dons
21 Fed uniform for his fourth suc-
cessive soccer season and for the
second year he wears the puiple
and gold as co-captain.

Coming to State as an all-around
high school athlete <3 years each
of soccer, basketball and track, plus
4 of baseball) Bill made his initial
soccer appearance in the first
game of his freshman year against
Queens. State fans first saw Bill in
the inside right and left positions.
His Sophomore year he switched to
right half back. In his Junior year
Bill made the final change to cen-
ter half in which position he will
start tomorrow.

Oswego Game Best

The outstanding game as Bill sees
it was the Oswego-Stute battle with
the locals caught on the short end
of a 4-3 score. In this tilt four pen-
alty kicks took a win out of the
Peds’ record book.

The big Senior, who took the
marital vows this summer. looks
forward to a highly succeszul year.
“Man to man we're better than any
of our opponents and with enough
teamwork the squad will be better
than last year," states Bill.

His feelings are shared by his
teammate Tito Guglielmone. The
other co-captain who finds his
home in the soccer cage as goalie
says, "There isn’t an opposing team
we can't beat. We’re ten times bet-
ter than last year in regards to
spirit, talent and conditioning.”

The dark haired Mastic Beach
product who finds time to have his
name included on the Dean’s List,
can well remember the Geneseo
game three years ago when an in-
jury to John Pengelly allowed him
to crash into the lineup. From then
on Tito never wandered away from
the nets.

Remembers Geneseo Tilt

The Geneseo game of last year’—
played in a sea of mud stands out
best in the mind of the six foot
one inch Senior. The gumcwa vic-
tory for the Peds by all standards
except one (the score) _. was a.

Lead Peds As Co-Captains

   

A team in any sport is made up of
individuals, though the saying is
that individuals usually work as a
team Certainly, soccer fans here at
State will be clicering for our team.
but in order to promote more inter-
est in the guys who are wearing the
uniforms and doing the playing on
the soccer field, we‘d like to delve
into the back' round of some of the
Statesmen you will be seeing on the
ﬁeld, and give you some idea who is
representing State on our varsity
soccer squad.

Weieriniller, Lederman in 4th Year

Two men on this year's team are
out for their fourth year along with
co-cziptiiins Bonesteel and Guglie-
lmone. One is a 5 foot 8 inch for-
ward froni Wayland by the name of
Everett Wciei‘miller. Ev has been
:in asset to Coach Garcia's teams
for the past three years and should
receive a starting assignment this
year. Look for the smiling blonde
at one of the forward positions in
tomorrow‘s game.

Also in his fourth year with the
soccer team is Al Ledernian. Al
hails from Colonic where he was a
four letter man at Roessleville High
School. Willi three years of booting
experience behind him. AI will be
almost a sure bet to hold down his
fullback spot of last year.

two years on the soccer ﬁeld over

One Year Men Return

As for those returning for their
second year, the mentor has talent
in all positions. At halfback there
is Ed Koubek from East Islip, War-
ren Dunham of Melrose. Louis Del-
Signore from Watervliet and Ray
Castillo who lives in Middleburgh.
All of these saw a good share of
action last year. and will be return-

them are Joc Hickey. who has

Coach Game 5
Soccer Success

The success story due to drive.
drive and more drive may be a
story often told but it's blueprint
has been put to a successful use by
an instructor here at State with
more heart than height.

This drive of Coach Joe Garcia
had its start back in East St. Louis
High School where as a school boy
the soccer mentor took a liking to
wrestling and landed a berth on
the varsity squad.

His ability was soon proved at the
University of Illinois. Here he
wrestled and wrestled. By the time
he switched his wrestling tights for
a cap and gown U. of Ill. fans had
seen the scrappy athlete win thirty-
scven out of forty matches. He was
named most valuable wrestler and
placed second and third in the na-
tional wrestling meets for his Soph-
omore and .Iunior years. For three
years only one grappler had a right
t?) claim superiority over the wiry
Garcia in the Big Ten Champion-
ships.

It was inevitable that he should
become assistant wrestling coach at
Ohio where he attained his Mas-
ter‘s Degree,

When 1950 had rolled around
Garcia. found himself inking a con-
tract with this administration as a
soccer and Junior Varsity basket-
ball coach. For State Garcia was
not the only new addition. Soccer
had come into its own as a varsity
sport for the first time.

Within one or two years the new
blood in the Phys Ed department
began to push none other than
wrestling. Last year through his ef-
forts it was added as the fourth
varsity sport.

Garcia’s biggest thrills come when
he finds his men listed on the All-
State and All-American dream
teams. Uppei'classmen will remem—
ber his two most famous students—-
the All-American Lindberg brothers.

His biggest disappointment oc-
curred last year with the inability
of his talent laden soccer squad to
come through us well as might be
expected of them. The big downfall
hinged on the low spirit displayed
by both the team and the student
body. With nniiiy facnihur faces

back this your and with the team
spirit at a high cbb Garcia strong-
ly hopes that the other element of
spirit will also crowd itself into the
picture.

their opener to Brockport
State by a 4-0 count. After the
season was over however they
proudly looked back and pointed to
this as their only loss in their in-
itial season. The five wins included
wins over such weak teams as Siena
and ABC. Their toughest win was
perhaps the conquest of Plattsburg.
Sophomore Slump

The inevitable sophomore slump
again made its hated appearance in
1951 as the Peds found themselves
struggling at season's end to at
least attain a .500 average. In this
they failed by one as the final tally
showed a 2-3-1 mark. Powerful
Brockport State again shut out the
locals and the Black Knights of
West Point also handled the Peds
as if they owned them. The best the
Peds could accomplish was a win
over reliable Plattsburg and down
the newcomer on their slate —
Champlain,

Show 6—4 Record

Garcia again found reason to live
the next season as his now experi-
enced crew went about building
themselves up as an Empire State
soccer power. Although the records
only show a 6—4 record, losses sus-
tained included three by a one point
tally. The presence of newer coi-
leges such as Queens. Syracuse, Os-
wego and Geneseo made the play-
ers a little more enthusiastic as
they sweated out new conquests.

The sun shone even brighter on
the soccer picture at State the next
year as the Garciamen were to carry
State’s soccer fame all over New
York and play second fiddle only
to the invincible West Point Cadets.

After an opening 3-0 loss to
Queens the Peds went on to show
their foes footwork the likes of
which they had never seen. This
was the 8—2 won-lost season. This
was the year when Garcia let loose
with the biggest smile he could
form behind his familiar cigar as
he saw John Linberg make the All-
Amerlean squad along with the All-
state honors. Also given laurels
were John's older brother, Bill. Jack
Hughes, Al Lederman, and Al
Roeclein.

As the 1954 season rolled around
Garcia began scratching his head as
he learned of the loss of several
key men. The team came through
in good fashion with a 5-2-3 mark.
The only losses they sustained were
at the hands of RPI, Geneseo and
Panzer. John Lindberg again dis-
played his prowess as he was nam-
ed State's first Most Valuable Play-
er. Brother Bill teamed up with him
as both gained All-American lau-
reis.

Low Ebb

It was then that the disappoint-
ing season was to befall Garcia.
Willi potentially the most talented
group over grouped on the fields of
Beverwyck the team and the fans
hit a new low in spirit. The result
was a miserable 2-7-2 record.

The future? There's only one per-
son needed to give the team the
spirit it needs. See YOU at the
game tomorrow.
