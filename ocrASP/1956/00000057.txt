Council Chooses

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. OCTOBER 5. 1936

Fair Chairman;

Asks Potsdam State To Exchange

Wednesday’s S t u d e n t Council
meeting produced new committees to
investigate procedures for organiza-
tions to come under Student Asso-

the prospects of a Parent’s Week-
end here at state.

Marie Carbone '57 announced that
an invitation has been sent to Pots-
dam State Teachers College to par-
ticipate in our Exchange Program.
If Potsdam does not accept the in-
vitation, it will not be necessary for
State to ask another college withii
the State University. Those eligible,
announced Miss Carbone, to take
part in this program will be upper-
classmen well versed in curricular
and extra-curricular activities with
a scholastic average of C. If the
ﬁrst exchange is early next semes-

Lorraine Kozlowski '58, was ap.
pointed the chairman of State Fair.

Council decided that some action
should be taken against unwanted
crowding of the Student Union by
members of other colleges. The dis-
cussion was aroused by Siena’s re-
cent visit, but the general discussion
was the problem of all outsiders.
John Yager '59, moved to table the
motion to recommend that the Stu-
dent Union be closed to all outside
colleges except with specific invita-
tions. This motion was passed. The
main motion will be discussed at
next week’s Council meeting. Also
at that time appointments will be
announced to the Remodelling of
Admissions Program Committee and
the Centralized Publication Com-
mittee which will be temporarily

ter, it may be possible to carry out headed by Marcia Lawrence ’57.

Michael Maxian ’57, were elected to
the Inter - Collegiate Association
Commission.

Robert Levy, Graduate student,
will serve as chairman of the Col-
lege Camp Board until February.
In his report to Council, Levy urged
that Council members visit the Dip-
pikill Camp before Thanksgiving.
William Schwager ’58, is the new
member of the Camp Board.

The College Directory should be
available to students in early Nov-
ember, reported Clarice Coleman
‘57. Lists will be posted on Monday
with all names that will go in the
Directory.

All students should check these
lists and make any necessary cor-
‘: rections.

 Council voted to approve the Class

1' of 1958's quorum as 40. A quorum
of 15 was approved for the Senior
Class.

Skit, Bonfire,

‘ Activities Night To Feature

Snake Dance

Activities in Page Hall will bring to a close tonight

the newly initiated Activities Week.

The evening will be-

gin at 7:30 with a skit, and culminate with a bonfire
on Beverwyck Field, announces Mary Bradley ’58, Chair-
man of the Activities Week program.

The Sophomore Class will present the skit as is the
tradition at State. The show will be approximately one-

half hour long, and is being

directed by Ella Mizell. This

skit affords to the freshman class an excellent oppor-
tunity to see just what type of competition in this field

they will be meeting in future weeks.

Immediately following the skit,
the Class of 1960 will be presented
their banner by their sister class,
the Juniors. John Yager '59, Chair-
man of this event, states that all
classes will be represented on the
stage during the presentation by
their banner and committee. The
song of the Class of 1960 will then
be sung, and the Page Hull program
will finally close with the singhig
of the College Alma Mater.

A snake dance beginning at Page
Hall will end at Beverwyck Field
where a bonfire will be held. The
bonfire is to take the form of a rally
for our soccer team for their game
tomorrow against Adelphi College.
The rally will be led by the cheer-
leaders. Rosemary Santonicola '58,
is the chairman of the bonfire

In previous years in keeping with
the single Saturday morning that
was set aside for the freshmen to
sign up for activities, the freshman
class had received their banner in
a. morning ceremony. This year's
weekly program gives a better op-
portunity for the freshmen to meet
the members of an organization,
and to become acquainted with its
functions.

Judicial Body

Sara Jane Duffy, Chairman of
Myskania, announces that Myskania

dates for “Who's Who in American
Colleges and Universities" to Stu-
dent Association today. The motion
