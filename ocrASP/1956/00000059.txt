That pearl of wisdom is from Cort-

Elvis Presley belongs in a cage.
True, true.

For those who are suffering from
sneezes and coughs, the University
of Kansas is offering a course in
viruses. They are studying the vi-
ruses causing respiratory diseases
and infectious mononucleosis, a
mild infection common in a young
adult population.

Dear Larry—How can you afford

The gem of the week from Kan-

An overwhelming interest in the
World Series was exempliﬁed by a
casual remark overheard in their
Student Union. As the Yankees
came to bat in the top of the ninth,
one coed muttered tensely to her
female companion:

“Gee, I wish Charley would get
a razor like that."

Deans Release
Housing Data

A breakdown of 1956 enrollment
ﬁgures has been released by Ellen
C. Stokes, Dean of Women, and
David Hartley, Dean of Men. Total
enrollment for this year, including
188 graduate students, reaches 2,067
as opposed to the 1955 enrollment
of 1,948. Women students number
1.154 and men total 913, thus de-
stroying the Old 2 to 1 ratio of
women to men.

Dormitory housing has been pro-
vided for 40% of the student body;
a decrease of 5% from last year.
There are 602 women and 230 men
in campus housing this year, total-
ing 832, in contrast to 605 women
and 283 men of last year‘s total.

The reduction in housing facili-
ties for men was occasioned by the
loss of Van Derzee Hall. Newman
Hall for women, housing 55 girls.
was also sold, but the college pur-
chased East House and West House
to compensate for the loss. East
House and West House presently
accommodate 68 girls, or an increase
of 13 over Newman’s capacity.

In 1955 the sorority and
fraternity houses housed 106 wom-
en and 101 men; this year their
numbers were increased to 113
Women and 104 men. Gamma Kap-
pa Phi, located temporarily in two

Goofed.

That‘s exactly what I did in my
prediction of the series. The ball
playing in this year's World Series
was at a paramount. Never before
has the pitching been stupendous,
the action so tense, and the pres-
sure so high. The Yankees certain-
1y deserved the series after Don
Larsen performed the unbelievable
of a perfect game, but the Dodgers
hung on until Wednesday when the

the Yanks on to their seventeenth
World Championship. Our hats are

tory and to the Dodgers for their

Varsity Cagers,
Grapplers Start
Daily Practice

Varsity wrestling practice will be-
gin Monday in the Milne Gym. All
those interested, whether experi-
enced or not, are asked to report
to the captain of this year's squad,
Austin Lenny, at 4 o'clock in the
gym. Lettermen of last year's squad
will be in the Milne Gym to teach
newcomers the basic fundamentals
of wrestling.

The grappling season opens
around November 15th, giving the
team approximately a month to get
in shape. The schedule this year
calls for ten intercollegiate matches,
though it is not yet complete.

Iloop Practice Commences

Also on Monday, the 1956-57 bas-
ketball squad will begin practice in
the Page Gym. With seven lettermen
returning to bolster Coach Sauers'
line-up, State should be able to
better last year's 11-9 record. All
other hoopsters who are interested
in varsity or junior varsity ball are
asked to report to Page Gym at 4
pm. on Monday. Tryouts for J.V.
ball will be held on Monday, Wed-
nesday and Friday evenings during
the next two weeks.

Any person interested in applying
for a position us manager of the
J.V. basketball team should contact
John Benton ‘57, or Couch Sauers.

Shilling under the stars this week
are two football players who helped
lead their rcspw'tivc teams to vic-
tory in AMIA football competition
this week. Bill "Hiram" Walker,
backing the APA squad this year,
led his team to a 26-0 victory over
KB by scoring three touchdowns.

The second member of our spot-
light is John Rookwood, quarter-
back of Potter Club. His passing
led thc club to it 14-12 win against
SL8 in u slum—banging ball game.

fine play throughout
games.

In the words of William Saroyan,
“Baseball is caring . , . The caring
is whole and constant, whether
warranted or hopeless, tender or
angry, ribald or reverent. From the
first pitch until the last out the
caring continues.“ And so, we
Dodger fans will go on caring and
putting our old slogan back into
usuage, wait until next year.
Blood and Guts

Back here at State, the AMIA
football season has been marred
with injuries in the three games
that were played up until Wednes-
day. In the SLS-Potter Club game
there were three injuries. One Pot-
ter Club player suffered a torn
muscle and another on injured
nose. An SLS man left the game
with a broken arm, while another
was involved in a head collision
which stunned him for a. short pe-
riod. In the KB-APA game, one KB
lincsman had his case diagnosed as
a f racturcd hipbone and another was
out with minor injuries. Don‘t you
think there should be some type of
equipment for this sport of touch
tackle?

Four For Fifty-Nine

Saturday saw the Sophomores
smiling after they had taken four
out of five big points from the Yel-
lowjackets as Rivalry opcnel on the
softball diamond of Dorm Field.

The Soph girls won, 11—2, and the
men, 13—6, with the cheering going
to the freshmen.

By NORM KOSLOFSKY

The biggest game of the season
to date took place Tuesday when
Potter edged out SLS, 14-12, in the

closing minutes.

The winners jumped to a 12-0 lead
in the first half on passes from
Rookwood to Dailey and Anderson.
in the third
quarter on a pass from Orrnsbee to
Tibbetts. They tied it in the final
period on another pass from Orms-
bee, which practically everybody on
the field touched before LaRochelle
decided to end the fun and run for
a TD. It went that way until the
last few minutes when Benton broke
through for Potter and tagged La-
in the end zone. Other
vital statistics were: one mild con-
cussion, one fractured arm, a few
torn ligaments and muscles, and
assorted bruises. (Who needs equip-
