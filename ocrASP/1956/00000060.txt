STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. OCTOBER 12. 1956

France, England Blast American

Hedging Tactics

Conference piled on conference
in the Suez Canal dispute and the
world powers were not much closer
to a solution. A Suez Canal Users
Association was set up by fifteen
countries, including the U. S., Brit~
ain and France. It was organized
for either taking member ships
through the canal or finding an
alternative route around South Af-
rica. At the U.N., France filed a
charge against Egypt’s unilateral
action while Egypt complained
against the Anglo-French threats
of force.

As for the Canal itself, Egypt was
surprising the world by showing
that it was capable of running the
Suez with its own pilots. However,
the strain was beginning to show
on these pilots after their many
hours of overtime.

While all this was brewing the
three Western powers were having
their own arguments. Britain and

Commuters Club
Stages Soc-Hap

The Commuters' Club Soc-Hop

Gym, according to Helen Cassa-
vaugh ’57, and Delores Peck ’58,
Co-Chairmen. Gordon Hilton will
provide the music frcm 8 to 12 pm.
Admission will be sixty cents per
person; one dollar per couple.

Chaperoning the dance will be

of Physics, and Mrs. Lanni; Charles
F. stokes, Professor of Music, and
Mrs. Stokes; and Daniel Ganeles,
Assistant Professor of Social Stu-
dies, and Mrs. Ganeles. Diess will
be very informal, no shoes required.
Prizes will be given for the largest
and smallest feet.

Commuters’ Club will also hold a
social meeting in the upper lounge
at Brubacher next Tuesday from
3 to 5 pm, states Barbara Rohrer
'58, President. All freshmen and
upperclassmen interested in joining
are invited to attend. A special in-
vitation is given to students living
in apartments, who are considered
commuters.

Science Group Plans
Freshman Reception

Audrey Briggs '57, President of
the American Chemical Society, an-
nounces that they will hold a re-
ceptan for freshmen on Wednes-
day at 8 pm. in the upper ltungc
at Brubacher.

The American Chemical Society
is made up of students majoring or
minoring in the field of Science.
This is a new organization founded
on campus last year.

This reception is being held in
place of the originally scheduled
one during activities week.

 

ln Suez Crisis

KOSLOFSKY

France both accused John Foster
Dulles of “selling them down the
river." They were, perhaps, a. little
hasty in judging Mr. Dulles’ in-
tentions, but in view of his actions,
or rather lack of action they can
hardly be blamed. The one thing
that might have dissuaded Nasser
from seizing the Suez would have
been a strong stand on the part of
the U. S. against such a. move. This
was not forthcoming. Instead there
was much hedging, for which Presi-
dent Eisenhower must share equal
blame, and Nasser felt safer to make
his move. It was Dulles who wanted
to propose a solution to Nasser; a
solution he himself did not believe
in. Last week he stated that in the
area of colonialism the U. S. play—
ed an independent role from Britain
and France, prompting the London
Times to accuse him of “grave dis-
service to Anglo-American unity."
Mr. Dulles seems to be trying to
play up to both sides. He is giving
lip service to the cause of inter-
national justice while trying not to
occur the enmity of Egypt, an im-
possible task since they are on op-
posite sides of the fence.

All this leaves Nasser in a rela-
tively strong position. Due to Dul-
les' hedging, the Egyptian premier
feels no fear of any possible force
used against him. He also has no
fear of any boycott against the
Canal. Although such action would
be costly to Egypt it would be tre—
mendously more expensive for the
boycotting countries. For this rea—
son, many of the small user nations
would not be willing to enter into
a new route.

Nasser's only weakness is his need
for outside capital to improve the
Canal for the use of newer and
larger ships coming into use. Only
the West and mainly the U. S. can
give him this financing and are
therefore in a strong position to
strike a hard bargain.

Council Receives

Siena Apology,-

Deleats Move To Close Union

By EMIL POLAR

Student Council’s Wednesday eve-
ning meeting included committee
reports, an apology from Siena Col—
lege, appointments to the Parents'
Weekend Committee and to Ad—
missions Procedure for New Organ-
izations Committee, Pedagogue re—
port, defeat of the recommendation
to Student Union Board to exclude
uninvited outsiders from the Stu-
dent Union, hearing of the Outing
Club inventory, and the waiving of

311M! Cede/i

We were at Bru dinner the
other night when our attention
was caught by a rather fantastic
scene. A group of boys was
gathered in round table fashion
enjoying a meagre repast. This
in itself was not fantastic. Boys
do eat in our dining room and
almost any place else they can
find food. It was only when we
gazed downward that the in-
credible became credible. One
particularly athletic looking
chap was wearing a well wrink-
led pair of khaki bermudas.

It’s not that we frown on
casual attire for men. If you
wish to dine casually that’s
probably an excellent way to
get in the mood. He possibly
would have gone unnoticed but
his feet seemed especially large
for a girl's. Wonder if he'll set
a new 'vogue in dinner dress for
men? If not it was a nice try
and made novel table talk.

 

 

Religious Organizations Combine
To Form Ecclesiastic Council

The Religious Clubs at State Col~
lege have united to form a new or-
ganization which will be called the
Council of Religious Clubs, states
David Goldberg '57, temporaiy
chairman of the new organization.

The following religious clubs are
members of the newly-formed Re-
ligious Council: Canterbury, Chris-
tian Science, Hillel, Inter-Varsity
Christian Fellowship, Lutheran Stu-
dent Association, Newman, Student
Christian Association, and West—
minster Student Fellowship. Indivi-
dual membership of the Council
shall be composed of the President
and one member at large from each
organization. Officers shall be a
chairman, an assistant chairman,
and a secretary.

Below are listed some purposes of
Religious Council as ratified by that
group: “The Council of Religious
Clubs at NYSC’l‘ at Albuny shall
represent its member clubs to the
administration, faculty, and Stu-
dent Association. It shall stimulate
students to affiliate with a religious
organization of their preference. it
shall focus attention on the activi-
Lics of religious clubs.

Canterbury Club will meet at 6:30
|).lll. Sunday at the Cathedral Guild
House, states Duvid Goldberg '57,

the By-Laws of the Student Asso-
ciation Constitution dealing with
frosh elections.

Council passed the motion where-
by a maximum of $25.00 be appro-
priated to the Classes of '59 and ’60
to be used for rivalry skits. The
Convocations Committee reported
that a new revision has been made
of assembly seating so that all
freshmen now have seats.

The Presidents of the Siena Sen-
ate Council and of the Sophomore
Class were present and made apol-
ogies for the recent Siena raid.
They stated that it was not organ-
ized by the college and hoped it
would not occur again but offered
little solution. When those who took
part in the incident are found, the
administration of Siena is to take
action. It was mentioned that more
friendly relations with Siena Col-
lege are being sought through New-
man Club.

The following were appointed
to the Admissions Procedure for

N ew Organiza tions Committee :
Harry Smith and Frank Favat,
Sophomores; Helen Betner and

Lloyd Seymour, Juniors; and Mor-
ton Hess '57. Appointed to the Par-
ents‘ Weekend Committee were
Mary LaPorte ’59; Bill DeGroat and
Florine Skutnik, Juniors; and Rich-
ard Feldiinan '57.

Beth Beehler '57 reported that
work on the Pedagogue for 1957 is
progressing in good order.

Student Council defeated the rec-
ommendation to Student Union
Board to exclude uninvited outsid-
ers from the Student Union. It was
felt that the Student Union could
enforce its own measures concern-
ing the problem of outsiders. Coun—
cil felt that the Student Union
should not be closed.

Council passed the Outing Club
inventory. The AMIA inventory was
not considered because no repre-
sentative was present. Council mov-
ed that the By-Laws of the Student
Association Constitution be waived
so that the freshman elections will
be held November 9 to eliminate a
two week interval between elections
and Campus Day when the results
are announced.

The agenda for next week's Stu-
dent Council meeting includes dis~
cussion of the Hospitality Commit-
tee. elections for a Senior member
to Inter-Collegiate Association, a
replacement for Camp Board, and
a train chainman. evaluation of
Student-Faculty Committee, and the
hearing of the AMIA inventory.

Dean Explains
Certification Rules

Oscur E. Lanford, Dean of the
College, announces that the New
York State Education Department
has revised the requirements for
ing of all academic subjects. Re-
quirements for Commerce and school
librarians have not been revised.

After September 1, 1958, two
types of certificates will be avail-
ublc One is u provisional certificate
for which application may be made
uftcr the fourth your of study and
which is held for five years. A
gruduutc prior to September 1958
cull uppr for a provisional certifica-
Lion. The second is 11 permanent
ccrilficule for which a fifth your of
study is ncccssury for u|iplicutioii.

Ullill September, 1958, there is no
legal provision for u provisional cer-
fiflcule. However, [he stole has been
issuing emergency certificates good
for one year ill a time to holders
of the buchelor degree. At present
the only permanent certificate of-
Iercd is the one applied for after
five years of study. The require~
menus for a permanent certificate
are new higher. In addition. the fifth
year of study must include a mini-
mum of course work in the student's
major field.

The changes in graduate study
requirements and the effects of the
new certification requirements on
the present four year curriculum
will be explained in a later issue
of the paper.
