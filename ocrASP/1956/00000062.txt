Charlie ChaniMoves lnto Town;
Gambling Hits Cafeteria Crowd

By DAVID CASE

What can you buy with a nickle
nowadays? Not much, in most
cases, with one big exception . . .
the Campus Chest Chinese Auction.
Five cents there can buy anything
from a dinner at one of the sorori-
ties, to a wench to wait on you in
your dorm.

The auction is held from 11-12
in the main cafeteria. It is run
on a timed basis, the last bid taken
getting the prize. Most bids amount
to a nickle, which gets us back to
the opening line.

Isn’t it worth a nickle to have
a member of the faculty wait on
you hand and foot at dinner? You
have a choice between Mr. Dumble-
ton, Mr. Carino. Miss Newbold, or
Miss Sivinski. Or, fearful of the
retribution they may enact in class,
you can buy a waitress from among
your peers . . . or a waiter. depend-
ing on your sex.

Another possibility is the movie
passes which are auctioned every
day, and even a late permission to
go with them. And this brings us

to the real reason behind this arti-
cle. . . . If any beautiful girl gets
both late permission and a couple
of free passes, I may consider auc-
tioning off a date with me.

Program For
Polio Vaccine

The College is carefully consider-
ing a plan for offering polio vaccine
shots at minimal or no expense to
every student who so requests an-
nounces Elmer Matthews, Director
of Teachers Placement Bureau. This
plan is still in the formative state,
and before it can be effected, cer-
tain information must be dispensed
and other information collected
from the student.

Students are free to take advan-
tage, or not, of such a plan if it
is offered. It should be pointed out
that many students may prefer to
receive their injections from their
private physicians. which is ap-
proved by the College Physician and
Administration.

At present, cards are being sent
home from the College which are to
be signed by your parents and sent
immediately to you at your local
address for you to ﬁll in your part.
The completed card is to be brought
into Mr. Matthews' ofﬁce in Draper
106 before Friday, October 26.

Praises
TV Experiment

Educational television has been
praised by Francis E. Almsted.
Special Consultant on Educational
Television for New York State. Dr.
Almstecl said that “without reserva-
tion" television in the classroom has
demonstrated “outstanding and suc-
cessful results."

Dr. Almsted said that. “based on
accepted classroom standards and
reliability of our measurement in-
struments, students have learned as
much or more (through television)
than is the case when traditional
classroom methods are employed.”

Here at State we join with State
Teachers College at Brockport in
participating in an experimental
education TV program.

reliability of our measurcmcnt in-
Education (A u d i o - Visuali, with
Alan Stephenson, technician, and
Edward Sabol. Coordinator of Field
Services. are in charge of the pro-
gram hcre at Statc. The first phase
is to be used for teaching Education
classes by channeling in scenes from
different classronis in the Millie
High School. The second phase of
the program might be used for
teaching mass classes in Psychology,
Mathematics, Spanish and Coin-
merce.

The third phase or use of the tele-
vision experiment would be to tele-
vise Biology experiments so that
all the students would be able to
have a good view of the experiment.

This is a one your experiment at
State. The actual programming bo-

APA Squad Defeats SL5 Eleven
In Last Fifteen Seconds Ol Play

A surprising switch in AMIA foot—

as the scorcs of the games were
predominame larger than the lllllll-

Willi the accident prone players

ball talk of the week centered
around (he APA—SLS game played

could have gone either way. Score-
Icss all the way, the gridiron men
from South Lake found the game
ending 1:3 seconds too late for them.
It was in these precious few seconds
that Bill “Hiram” Walker found
John Spaargarden standing in the
end zone watching all the spectators
and hit him with the leather. It
was paydirt for the gridiron powers
of Madison Avenue as they ran oil
the conflncs of Dorm field with a
big 6-0 victory. LuRochcllc called
the plays for the SL8 squad.

on :i 13 yard flip. In the second
quarter the versatile blonde from
Binghamton found Harry Millet an-
ticipating his toss. Just for kicks
Tom let loose with the extra point
toss. In the midst of this and his
next TD pass to Benton the smiling
Saylesman took a break from the
scoring as his teammates came
through with a safety. Bricrly to
Ficrro made it 29-0 late in the
fourth and by this time the club
showed mercy on their foes by al-
