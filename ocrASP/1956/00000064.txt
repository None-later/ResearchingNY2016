STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. OCTOBER 19

Latest Israel, Jordan Battle Places

Americans, British
. By FRANK

Sarajevo, Pearl Harbor, powder-
kegs that have set the world adame
during the twentieth century. A
Jordanian fortress known as Quallg-
ilya may well be the tinderbox for
another inferno of world conﬂict
and destruction.

Qualigilya. only eleven air miles
from Tel Aviv. capital of Israel, was
on October 10 and 11 the scene of
a retaliation raid by units of the
Israeli forces. Usually an outburst
of this sort could be written off as
a border incident, but there are
factors in this case that make it
impossible to do so.

The factors that make this an
issue of concern are l) Israeli and
Arab officials describe Qualigilya as
the biggest battle since the Arab-
Israeli war ended in 1948. This
coupled with fact that neither side
attempts to play down the incident
as per usual policy constitutes the
ﬁrst factor.

The second factor or reason is
that the conﬂict arises at a time
when the prestige of the Jordanian
government and King Hussein is at
an all time low with the people of
Jordan. The Amman or Hussein
factor of Jordan is faced not only
with the problem of a troublesome
border but they are also threatened
by the internal disintegration of
Jordan itself. Internal unrest has
already caused ﬁve Amman cabinets
to resign in the last ten months.
In the forthcoming general election
in October. Hussein fears he may
lose control of the governing houses
of Jordan.

The third reason that enters the
picture is the question of how
strong Jordan will be in the next
few months. Should the country
falter, it has stated it will call in its
Arab neighbors, notably Iraq to
keep Israel from gaining control.
The Israelites have stated that the"

ln Predicament

SWISKEY

will resist
nature.

The fourth factor that appears is
the fact that the retaliation at
Qualigilya marks a shift of Israeli
military operations to the Arab
triangle. The important point here
is that the vulnerable Haifa-Tel
Aviv corridor lies directly opposite
it. Here the country of Israel is
only eleven miles wide. An invasion
at this point could seriously cripple
Israel by cutting it in two and cap-
turing its capital city.

Qualigilya incident emphasizes the
different stands taken by the United
Nations and Israel on the subject of
dealing with attackers that cross
the armistice line of 1948. The
United Nations represented by Dag
Hammerskjold maintains that Israel
has no right to cross the truce line
not even to punish raiders.

The Israeli government claims
that the UN. recognizes both the
right of self defense and reprisals
for premeditated acts of aggression.
They also stress that their appeals
to the UN. for action went unheed-
ed and that they must ﬁght to
protect their people. Over half the
Israeli population lives close to the
danger line.

The quarrel has left both the
United States and Great Britain
on an island of quicksand. Great
Britain has two important military
outposts in Jordan that are essential
in the defense of the near east.
Should Jordan fall, Great Britain
would lose no matter who won. The
United States has vital pipe lines
for oil that stretch across Jordan's
wasteland. We face the same prob-
lem as Britain, that is. war will
destroy vital links in West’s defense
chain of the near east. The question

any attempt of this

facing Britain and the United
States is simple. Oil and Truces or
War and Final settlement either
way.

C arlsonSuggests
Higher Teacher
Retirement Age

William S. Carlson, President of
the State University of New York,
presented a plan to overcome the
present shortage in teachers, at the
annual meeting of the Association
of New York State College Faculties
last week. His plan was aimed at
changing the mandatory retirement
age for teachers.

Renewing his call for a re-exam-
ination of the university's faculty
retirement policy, Mr. Carlson
pointed out that the extension of
the present retirement age from 65
to 70 could, over a period of time,
increase the supply of teachers by
as much as 12 per cent.

In his speech President Carlson
was referring to the recent action
of the University of Oregon in rais-
ing their retirement age to 72. This
action Carlson believes to be “a
straw in the wind." and he expects
that “all institutions may be headed
in this direction."

Previously the mandatory age for
teacher retirement in New York
State was 65. Having reached that
age. despite his ability and despite
the serious shortage of teachers, the
teacher is bound to retire. President
Carlson's plan would remedy this
situation.

tend. The club is especially anxious

Animolistic Attributes Associated
With Mathematics Mojor-ettes

Hy Alt’l‘ I’LO’I‘NIK

This article is the first of a series
dealing with categorized students
that fall under a variety of horrify-
ing stereotypes. The series will pre-
sent the nature of the "type," the
truth of the generalization. and pos-
sible remedies of the situation. This
week: The female mathematics
major.

This type is an illllLIllll with long
funny curs. she kicks up at any-
thing she llUill'lS . . . these song lyrics
come close to describing the typed
l‘cinzilc ninth major. Is it not logi-
ciil that u woman choosing ii career
generally associated with males
would resemble an animal? And I
have actually seen too many of this
category "kick up" at anything they
hear. . . . "Good morning," says the
prof, and BOOM—«out comes the
pencil, a twelve pound notebook.
and an expression with division signs
instead of dimples. Scraggly hair
and unshaven legs are pathetically
associated with the lady logarithim
. who wants to groom when there
are three hours of math problems to
toy with: And from what I have

seen. doing a were three hours of
math homework is the worst sin

since Eve bit the apple.

The truth of the stereotype? Too
much of it is true for the weak heart
in endure. Of course it. would be rid-
iculous to say that feiniili inuthe-
muiiciains become animulish . .
Just a coincidence. I suppose. ’l‘lie
monkey-like responsiveness might
be explained by pointing out that it
is lady-like. to be polite. attentive,
and industriouskthut is, it's lady-
llke to be monkey—like. The poor
grooming of the poor girl is grossly
exug‘gcrted in the type, but is appar-
ent to the percepiual eye. Another
coincidence, perhaps. The high
moral code of homework is again
exaggerated, but present neverthe-
ess.

The remedy, if it is desired, is a
simple one. If the admittedly few
women who fall under the exact
type would read a little Freud or
Kinsey, they may realize that there
are other things in life besides
math.
