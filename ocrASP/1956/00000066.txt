ShOpping Habits

Lewis Carr ’57, President, states
that Distributive Education Club is
conducting a survey of the down-
town Albany and Central Avenue
district this week to study the shop-
ping and transportation habits of
shoppers.

Thirty-five students from the club
are questioning shoppers in the
stores and on the streets at various
hours of the day. Two questions will
be asked the shoppers: Would you
shop downtown more often if the
stores were open more than one
evening a week and what transport-
ation did you use to get to the shop-
ping district.

This survey will contact the nec-
essary 15,000 shoppers that the Al-
bany Chamber of Commerce has
requested. Answers will be used by
retailers and other businesses in
making future plans for improved
service.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. OCTOBER 26. 1956

 

By NATALIE LEMOINE

It’s in the book, These are actu-
ally city and state laws.

Under Michigan law, inmates in
state prisons are supposed to pay
for their own room and board. Not
much different from going to State.

“Kibitzing” at a card game —
bridge, poker, or solitaire is against
the law in Emporia, Kansas.

An old Boston, Mass, ordinance
forbids baths without a physician's
authority.

Centralia, Washington. requires
all male residents to grow beards
between the dates of June 20th and
August 4th.

(From The Spectrum)

Ode to a. Kiss.
Our doctors with warnings so
gloomy,
Say germs in girl’s kisses abound.
But if these bugs kill.
Then draw up my will.

What sweeter a death could be
found?

A good little freshman was hur-
rying to class in a state of extreme
agitation. “Please. God, don’t let
me be late," he murmured as the
class bell began to ring in the dis-
tance.

At that moment he tripped and
fell flat on his face.

“Please, God,” he exclaimed in an
injured voice as he picked himself
up, “I didn’t say push!”

(From The Racquette)

Some quaint definitions from the
McGill Daily.

Chewing gum: Substitute for self-
confidence.

Undergraduate: Pre-med student.

Experiences: Are almost unpleas-
ant; but make you grow up.

Drudgery: See under study.

Beware Freshmen.l Silence Spells Board Schedules Student Trip To Warrensburg;

Doom - - - Tuning Tones Tell Tale Stude

By WILLIAM FRANKONIS

Listen, as you walk through the
halls of various dorms. Listen to the
melodic strains of music issuing
forth from a. scant number of rooms.
Freshman rooms, to be particular.
Listen, and support my claims that
the dulcet tones emerge from too
few rooms. Woe the unsuspecting

freshmen l
Soon comes the day, young
friends, when companions and

Sophomores will be privileged to
land the talent of your vocal chords.
The sound of young, eager voices
will resound through the atmos-
phere at State. Everywhere will joy-
yous voices be raised in song as "arm
in arm," gay, young souls stoutly
carry on the traditions of State.
But woe the indolent freshman!

Think back, upperclassmen. Think
back to the days of yore when you
too were honored to exercise the
tones of your golden voice. Remem-
ber, with nostalgia, that you are no
longer thus honored. Think of the
happy hours spent in song, and envy
those who are about to ascend the
illustrious stage of melody. But pity
the unsuspecting freshman!

Pity those from whose room comes
not the gentle sound of song. Pity
those from whose domain ('manalcs

only the depressing, dreary silence
of study. Yet, in your pity, seek to
enlighten those who are cloaked in
silence. Remind them of the eager
anticipation of the Sophomore mu-
sic lovers. Remind them of the
“stunts and sings,” “the frolics and
dances" that lie in the near future.

Dawns the light yet. freshmen?
In this “great big puddle,” are you
still “in a muddle?" Is your brain
still “in a fog?" Beware “little
frog.” The Ides of March may not
be upon you, but the November ears
of the Sophomores are!

Deon Reveals
Rules Changes
For Certificates

In the last issue of the News a
typographical error occurred in the
first paragraph in the article con-
cerning the requirements for teach-
ing certification. The paragraph
should have read:

Oscar E. Lanford, Dean of the
College, announces that the New
York State Education Department
has revised the requirements for
pcrnnmcnt certification for teach-
ing of all academic subjects. Re—
quirements for Commerce and
school librarians have not been re-
vised.

After September 1, 1958 a provi-
Shilllll certificate. which may be
hold for fivc years. and a perman-
cni ccrlil‘iczuc, which requires a
i'ilili ycnr of study will be available.

“ 14 actual
£00k ”

The scene was Western Ave-
nue on a Friday night. The char—
acters involved were Bob, Ilcr—
man and .Iohn of h‘ayles "all
and Jean and Mary Ellen. Little
did the guys know that one was
a disc-jockey when the females
picked them up, and gave them
a ride to Partridge Street, but
after all the formalities of get-
ting acquainted were over and
the girls left Partridge a half
hour after arriving, Mary Ellen
had taken a request to play “A
Casual Look” for the three on
her Saturday night show.

Saturday night, and doubts
faded as “Mary Ellen Calling"
came on the air. She wasn't
fooling about the disc jockey
bit, and she faked the guys
right out of their undershirts.

’I'hc acquaintance has pro-
gressed to a point now, that
Mary Ellen is going to play
“Music For You" by the Suyles-
men on her show. next Sutur-
duy at 7:15 p.m. on station

College Females, Mouse Travel To
Camp Johnson For Restlul Day

By WINIFRE

There is a certain group at State
College which enjoys exclusive priv-
ileges such as playing a rousing
game of basketball at 10 am. on a
Saturday morning, swimming Tues-
day nights, and jaunts to Camp
Johnson. The group to which I re-
fer is the Winsome Albany Ath-

May I propagandch a bit? OK.
now take this trip to Camp “J” that
the group made last weekend. Aside
from such obvious advantages as
going where you couldn‘t possibly
see your homework, and letting
your rooinle clean up for open
house, it was just plain nice out
in that country atmosphere.

bulb that wouldn’t fit. Ah, to be a
teacher!

Saturday morning, a drifting
aroma of Aunt Jemima's pancakes
gently awoke the silent sleepers.
They bounded up to greet the new
day, the pancakes, the mouse, and
20 fellow group members who were
just coming in, The new arrivals.
while longing for a day in the coun-
try. had lacked the pioneer spirit
necessary to make an overnight deal
of it. They brought all sorts of
things with them, including a bath-
ing suit. Talk about the ingenuity
of women: Lee used this to go swim-
ming (inch Dr. Hood's newest pneu-
inonin patient». Then with the three
fires that burned so bright (1’), the
cmnpcrs satisfied their ravenous ap-
petites. Far be it from me to attempt
to describe the luscious, thick, juicy

. hot dogs.

Something about the meal (or
perhaps the hours State women
kccpi engendered sleep, and so many
of the group konked out. Of course
the energetic frosh kept batting the
balls around. but isn't that just like
a freshman. anyway?

Did this sound like a pleasant
event? In spite of what it may have
sounded like, it really was. So, the
moral of this story is: you too can
be a Winsome Albany Athlete. Ap-

Camp Location

State College students are being
afforded the opportunity to gain
first hand information on the col-
lege camp, according to Robert levy,
Graduate Student and Chairman of

is sponsoring a trip to the Warrens-
burg campsite on Sunday, Novem-
ber 18 for all interested students.

trance of Brubacher Hall at 8 am.
Students will be charged a two dol-
lar transportation fee. and it is
suggested that each bring his own
lunch. Members of the Camp Board
will conduct tours of the camp area
for those attending.

Open Meeting

On a. date yet to be announced,

meeting to discuss the location of
the permanent camp. It is hoped
students who do make the trip will
offer their recommendations at this
meeting.

Students interested in traveling to
the Warrensburg camp may sign up
at the desk in Lower Draper and
buy their ticket for the bus. Reser-
vations open today and will con-

for a. washroom, put up siding on
the addition to the farmhouse. be-
gan work on its roof, and demolish-
