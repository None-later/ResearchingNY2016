State Varsity Club Keglers Bow Girls Inactivity P

To 'Siena College

The going got a little rougher for
the Varsity Club keglers as they
faced the powerful Indians of Siena
College last Tuesday night at the
Londonville College bowling alleys.

On the return trip home the Feds
found themselves unable to talk of
as much as one victory. Siena boast-
ed of their 4-0 sweep of the States-
men.

Siena Takes First

The result of the ﬁrst game made
the locals forget all about their
conquests of the last two weeks as
the defending champs of the Capi-
tal District Intercollegiate Bowling
League showed their winning form.
The totals on the ﬁrst game score
sheet read Siena, 926; State, 849.
Bob Coleman of the Indians must
have felt a little funny with his 141
game pitted along side his team-
mates' efforts of 204, 189, 209, and
183. Despite the opening loss Joe
Ketchum gained State's personal
laurels for the night as he sent the
maples ﬂying for a resounding 211
high single tally.

In First Setback

The middle contest found the In-
dians sweating out a 12 pin victory
thanks to the efforts of Bill Arcarl’s
223 and Dave Carpentier’s 221. Irv
Peterson and Dick Wemple were the
big headaches for State in this tilt
as they turned in scores of 205 and
194.

Clean Sweep

The night's ﬁnale ended with the
Indians making it a clean sweep by
a 881-788 count.

For Siena, Dave Carpentier ﬂash-
ed the biggest smile as he looked
back on his 606 triple.

Wemple carried away the triple
honors for the Teachers as he split
the maples for 541.

Causes Alarm

State College oﬁ’ers a wide pro-
gram of athletics for women. Prac-
tices and inter-dormitory events are
sponsored every afternoon and eve-
ning in many sports, including hoc-
key, soccer, archery, volleyball, and
tennis. In anticipation of the in-
creased enrollment, the Women‘s
Athletic Association ordered new
equipment for all of these activi-
ties. The managers of each activity
are trained to provide instruction
or to act as referees. At present
this program is standing idle.

Last week there were no more
than 35 girls at Frosh Frolic. There
were not enough interested girls to
accept a play day challenge from a
nearby college. Less than two per
cr nt of the women's enrollment have
shown interest in sports this year.

Have the women of State Col-
lege become lazy? Have they be-
come so engrossed in their studies
that they have forgotten to exercise
their bodies as well as their minds?

otter Gridiron Squad

Gains Intramural Lead

By JOE SWIERZOWSKI

Potter Club climbed to the top of
the wide open Intramural Football
Loop Wednesday as they struggled
through an 8-0 conqueset of the
powerful Vet gridiron squad.

The Club, which won its third
game of the season last Thursday
against Sayles by a 19-0 tally, found
ground a pretty scarce commodity
Wednesday afternoon.

A bad hike from center found the
men from State Street on the top
end of a 2-0 score at the midpoint
of the contest. The pigskin was de-
flected off the Vet signal caller and
made its way to the end zone much
to the delight of the EEP rooters.

Bricrly to Millet

A, pass from Brierly to Millett late
in the ﬁnal quarter broke the back
of the team that has always been
feared in IM grid circles.

To add insult to injury. it was the
ﬁrst time any Vet saw a member
of the opposition cross the white

Bob Kampf turned out to be the
big man for the Madison Maulers
as he tallied three TDs. Two passes
from Walker and an errant throw
which hit him paced the way for his
triumphs. Walker to Anderson add-
od six more and just for a change,
Walker ran one down field for an-
other count.

The Humps, who scored on a safe-
ty, proved their ability to take a
loss on the chin and entertaincd
their supporters (both of them) with
a bit of hilarious play late in the
ﬁnal period.

SLS gained their ﬁrst win of the

In a few weeks, the. fate of track
will be determined here at State.
Last year an attempt at building up
our intercollegiate sport program via
the track line was made and the
apathy that evolved brought it to
an abrupt but possibly temporary
halt. For a while, there was a large
charge of interest in track. as wit-
nessed by the accumlatcd names on
the sign up sheet. As the season
were on. it faded and only one in—
tercolle'iiatc match was run oll‘
Final Fence

Now, the ﬁnal fence is to be
crossed. If the interest that was
shown when the idea of track orig-
inated returns, the sport Could have.
a long term on our campus. It‘s up
to you who are interested. Lot‘s
build our sports program up and
make ourselves known more around

Spring Sports l’llsh

We. think it is generally agreed
that the spring sports program
could stand a boost. Along side of
track. we‘d like to see tennis earn
ll varsity letter. We were amazed at
ihc interest shown thus far in the
currcnt AMIA tcnnis tournament
bcing run off on the Washington
Park courts at the present time.
Wc bclicvc thch is enough interest
here at State to turn tennis into a
varsity sport. Some of those inter-

On television or not, the CiSco
Kid is still a star. This week, the
spotlight falls on State's Cisco Kid.
Bob Sischo of the SL5 football
squad. Bob scored three touchdowns
in SLS‘s 31-7 win over College
Hiights. and also received credit
for a safety when his kickoff was
run into the end zone on purpose.

Si‘cond spot this week goes to
another Bob, Bob F‘ierro of Potter
Club. In all of Potter‘s games thus
far, this speedy end has been a
highly efﬁcient player on the re-
cciving end of Rookwood and Bri-
t‘l‘ly passes.
