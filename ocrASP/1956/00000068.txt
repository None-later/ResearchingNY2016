Presidential Candidates Concentrate

Final Ettorts In Three Key States

By JOHN YAGER

Campaign Windup

With election day less than two
weeks away. both President Eisen-
hower and Adlai Stevenson are con-
centrating their final efforts in
three key states. These states, New
York, California, and Illinois, con-
trol 104 of the 266 electoral votes
that are needed to win the elec-
tion. The Republicans have the edge
in New York and California while
the Democrats have the lead in
Illinois. These are not the only
states to watch in this ’56 campaign.
There will probably be close races
in Florida, Virginia, Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Kentucky.
The “States’ Rights" Party has a
better than even chance to carry
Virginia. The Democrats received
a boost in Kentucky this week when
Governor Chandler came out in
support of Stevenson. His support
means that the state workers will
now come out and work for a Dem-
ocratic victory. There are two sen-
atorial seats at stake in Kentucky
and political analyists feel that the
Democrats and Republicans will
each capture one. Stevenson carried
Kentucky in ’52 by 700 votes and is
expected to do much better this
year. Florida is leaning toward
Eisenhower as is Massachusetts. Due
to the strong party patronage that
the Democrats control in Pennsyl-
vania, they should carry that state.
Ohio appears to be a toss-up.

The Republicans have campaign-
ed on a slogan of “Peace and Pros-
perity." Vice-President Nixon has
been doing most of the campaigning.
although President Eisenhower has
stepped up his campaign activity in
recent weeks. Their campaign has
been based on the Eisenhower rec-
ord. The major problem that the
Republicans have run into is that

of the farmers. There is consider-
able unrest in the farm areas. Most
of the criticism has been directed
against Secretary of Agriculture
Benson rather than President Eis-
cnhower.

The Democrats have concentrated
their efforts in two different areas.
Stevenson has been active in the big
cities on the East and West coasts,
while Kefauver has been concen-
trating his efforts in the farm belt.
He is extremely popular in this
area. The Democrats feel that as in
’48, they can hold the normal Dem-
ocratic states and pick up enough
electoral votes in the farm belt area
to win the election.

The main issue of this campaign
has been the hydrogen bomb tests.
Stevenson maintains that an inter-
national agreement should be reach-
ed to cease all such tests while
Eisenhower has emphatically op-
posed such a move. The issue be-
came an explosive one this week
when Soviet Premier Nikolai Bul-
ganin sent a message to the Presi-
dent advocating an end to all hy-
drogen bomb tests. Both presiden-
tial candidates have criticized Bul-
ganin for interferring in U. S. in-
ternal affairs. It is expected that
the issue of the hydrogen bomb will
continue to be a dominant one
throughout the remaining days of
the campaign. Even our scientists
seem to be split on the issue.

When the votes are all counted
this year, you will probably notice
that the voters have tended to shift
away from voting a straight party
ticket. This tendency will be noticed
particularly in New York, Ken-
tucky, Oregon, Pennsylvania and
Massachusetts. Watch for it.
