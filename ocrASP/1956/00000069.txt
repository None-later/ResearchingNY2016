Life of Edward Eldred Potter

Edward Potter was born Septem-
ber 3, 1891 in Windfall, New York.
He first attended Union College on
a scholarship, but after only a few
months he transferred to State Col-
lege. He was a member of the Class
of 1918. To save expenses, he and
another boy shared a tent in Wash-
ington Park. Leaving school for the
service, he spent his army career in
Paris.

Potter was chosen to become the
name of the club, because the stu-
dents who organized it felt that
Edward Eldred Potter best exem—
plified thclr ideals. He had proven
himself an all-round student by hav-
ing intcrcsts in poetry and industrial
arts, as well as participating in
sports. They felt that Potter was the
man they would best like to cxcm-
plify.

dccidcd that doing this would bring
about a series of brutal sircct fights
which would ultimately climlnutc
thc species. This would ncver do,
since a college without English mu-

Longer Season

According to Dr. Pettit, the first
.iroduction of the State College
Theatre group is being presented
early in the season so that the col-
lege will be able to enjoy a longer
season of theatrical entertainment.

Besides the abstract settings,
many two dimentional curd board
cut-outs, sound effects achieved
through strange methods, and a
1902 Penal-d car will play a major
role in producing numerous unusual
effects.

The play, a French farce by Jules
Romain, has been reviewed by the
critics as “one of the greatest and
most pointed of the French forces."
