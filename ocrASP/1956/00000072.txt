Bridggport Ngxt Fog A5 State Bowlers Sayles Upsets Alpha Pi Alpha,

Pads Pulverize Oswego

By DAVE

The full head of steam gathered
by the goal-getters of State was
pointed at Bridgeport, Connecticut
today by Joe Garcia as the Peds
prepare to repeat their blast of last
weekend on the sacred grounds of
Bridgeport tomorrow afternoon.
Six For Seven

Going after their fifth consecu-
tive win at the expense of the
Purple Knights as well as the sixth
win in seven starts, the Purple may
be without the services of Bill
Bonesteel who was injured in a
winning cause Saturday. The half-
back was not sure as the paper went
to press if his ankle will respond to
treatments during the week.

It was Warren Dunham. however,
who personally handed the Lakers
of Oswego their crying towels when
the young upstart in the Junior
Class twice gave the Orange goalie
ulcers in the third period to ac-
count for two of the four State
tallies.

This bit of meanness was pre- ‘x

ceded by the ice-breaking goal of
Carl Maxson who had given the
ball a ride in the first half to tie
the score. This was followed by
Dunham's two goals and Bobby
Backer's tally to rub salt in the
wound.
Crowd Treated To Defensive Feats
It was more than once that the
peppy crowd was treated to some
great defensive play as halfbacks
Dammer and Delsignore were aided
by Carl Maxson in substituting for
goalie Guglielmone who had wan-
dered so far from home that it be-
hooved the backs to make saves in
preventing the Orange men from
taking the free score offered them.
The good crowd included a con-
tingent of freshmen who were on
hand to watch the fast moving pair
of ball games as the varsity game

A.A. Board:

Group To Set
Track Meeting

At their meeting Tuesday after-
noon the members of Athletic Ad-
visory Board decided that the
forthcoming meeting to determine
the future of track at State will be
limited to the purpose specifically.
It will not seek to determine the
interest for new spring sports as
was previously reported.

The Board feels it must not bury
track before it is dead (if it is) and
therefore feels it must give its en-
thusiasts all the chances available.
Possible Investigation

If the interest does not material-
ize at this meeting the group will
then proceed to investigate other
sports to replace it.

The meeting (to be held the week
of November 11-18 at a day to be
set this Tuesday) will begin with
AA Board expressing their feelings
on the situation. Those sincerely in-
terested in participating in track
this spring will be asked to specify
the event holding their interest.

The floor will then be open for
any and all discussion. questions,
suggestions or complaints.

I 2M 3W

The center of the stage is held
by Lou Call of the Saylcs clcvcn
this week for his passing and run-
ning which he combined to lead his
team to their 0-6 win over APA.

'I'he runner-up spot goes to Owen
Davis of the Humps. Owen was on
the receiving end of one of the TD
passes which led to the Humps’
win over College Heights, and
caught another which set up the
Humps' other 'I'D.

Humps Humble Heights Contingent

Old Man Upset found his way into
the criteria of the Intramural
Football loop this week, as a heavy
Sayles eleven capitalized on a
blocked punt to turn back the pre-
viously undefeated APA squad, 9-6.
Punt Attempt Backfires

In the second period, John “Hoot”
Stefano, filling in at quarterka
for APA in the absence of Bill
Walker, went back to kick from his
own end zone on last down and the
ball connected with the posterior of
iis teammate, Brien Mortensen.
Sayles recovered on the five yard
line, and a pass from Lou Call to
Dave Pitkin, two plays later, led to
the initial scoring of the contest.
The extra point went the same way,
from Call to Pitkin.

In the second half, the Madison
Avenue eleven again found them-
selves forced to kick from their own
end zone. This time, Stan Davie was
doing the honors, and though the
kick was blocked, the referees
awarded Sayles two points because
Davie had stepped out of the end
zone. Alpha came back in the dark-
ness of the fourth quarter to score

their only touchdown.
Hail, The Conquering Heroes

In other action this week, the
Humps entered into the win column
via a 12-7 win over College Heights.
For the colorful clowns. Owen
Davis was the shining light as he
hauled in two passes. one to score
a TD, and the other set up the
Humps second score. His touchdown
pass came from Pete Barbegilota for
the Humps’ second tally. which fol-
lowed Frank Swiskey’s tallying pass
to Mike Reilly. The game was mark-
ed by crratic passing. and it was an
interception which led to College
Heights score, as Bob Dallow latch-
ed on to a Hump pass. Ron Frlck
sprinted around end to score the
extra point. However, the game is
under protest by College Heights
due to a play concerning whether
or not a Humper tried to run an
intercepted pass out of the end zone
or not.

In last Thursday's game between
fraternities. SLS walloped KB, 43-0,
in KB's last game before dropping
out of the league due to crippling
injuries.
