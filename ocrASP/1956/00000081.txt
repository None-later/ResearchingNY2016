Female Migration Explained,-
State Men Bow To Eskimos

By MARY FITZPATRICK

There is in this school an unfor-
tunate scarcity of men. To phrase
this in a better way (which may help
bolster male morale) there is an
over-abundance of women. No mat-
ter how we phrase it, the result is
always the same. Yearly, deep

Judiciary Board
Names Violators

Barbara Hungerford '57, Myskania
Chairman of Warnings, announces
that the following freshmen are
recipients of warnings for the vio-
lation of a State College tradition.
Two warnings: Robert Trotanglio,

Hedy Schwartz, Gerald Esarner,
Richard Therns. Harvey Abusch,
Joseph J ozefowicz, and Frances

Jadeck. Three warnings: Paul Rea-
gan, Richard Young Thomas Far-
rell, Richard Therns, and Priscilla
Herbst. Four warnings: Thomas
Farrell, Priscilla Herbst. and David
Case.

For the ﬁrst violation one warn-
ing wil be given by Myskauia. A
second offense results in the publi-
cation of the offender‘s name in the
State College News. A public apology
to either Student Association or
the Sophomore class must be made
by any third offender. Any student
receiving a fourth warning is auto-
matically disqualiﬁed for eligibility
to run for any class office.

voices (i.e. male) cry out to high-
pitched giggles (i.e. female) to re-
main within the narrow confines of
our college campUS and to date only
State men. Yearly, we see evidence
of traitors who boast of their off-
campus conquests in the form of
sweatshirts, hats and tatoos. all
bearing the name or insignia of
distant universities and Greek or-
ganizations.

Assuming the democratic privi-
lege. we hereby undertake to defend
this annual “great migration" to
paces and people beyond fair Al-
bany‘s immediate scope. One argu-
ment has already been advanced.
Girls have an unfortunate innate
desire to have dates (with boys).
One can get tired of weekly movie
excursions “with the girls.”

Numerous opportunities greet the
girl who transcends the magic cir-
cle of those who date on campus.
Engineers are often the recipients
of numerous exciting offers to de-
velop untamed areas. Only yester—
day we heard of a young girl who
was giving up dorm life to accom-
pany a young engineer on an ex-
peditionary trip to Alaska (as his
wife. of course). What did he offer
her?——a 1956 model dogsled with
automatic musher, a split level ig-
loo; her own spear, and an inboard
motor powered kayak.

All this leads to but one solution.
Eskimos must be outlawed from the
college and warmer relations pro-
moted among State students.

Kampf Komments:

Regarding Track Issue

   

Snow White and the seven dwarfs attended the special
meeting of the AA Board to determine the future of track
on an intercollegiate level on our campus. That can be
taken as literally as it is printed. Only seven men answered
the call for track interest on Wednesday. and the resulting
dim look taken by this turnout could definitely hamper the
efforts of the administration and AA Board in trying to
bolster the number of varsity sports on campus.

Where, Oh Where Are the Track and Field Men

Last year when the track issue started, the initial
sign—up sheet was filled by some thirty to forty names.
Thereafter, the interest continually slackened until the
time of our first intercollegiate meet with RPI. Thirteen

men went to this meet!

Now, we realize that the interest is somewhere on the
campus, and wherever it is, AA Board is going to make only
one more attempt to find it. This attempt will be made on
Tuesday of this coming week at the AA meeting in room
146 at 3 pm. We strongly urge any male who is interested
in building up our athletic program to attend this vitally
important meeting. It‘s up to you, the male student body,
if you are interested, to come out. Otherwise. the case of

track will be marked closed.

State Kegling Squad Ends Losing
Skein With 3-1 Win Over HVTI

The ice was finally cracked at
the Siena Bowling alleys this week
as State's representatives to the
Capital District Bowling League
broke their long twelve game losing
streak, For the Feds the three wins
that they were able to gain at the
expense of Hudson Valley chh
came rather easily.

Win First

The opener ended with the Teach—
ers on the bigger end of a 797-725
score thanks largely to the efforts
of Joe Ketchum who placed 180 pins
in a horizontal position. Tom Sul-
livan followed the bespectacled
kcglers with 169.

In the middle tilt the circles be-
gan appearing on the Perl score
sheet as split after split emerged
from the tenpins. After the tally
was finished it was State 722, HVTI
738.

The night's bowling ended with
the Statesmcn capturing their last
game and thus their first series in
four weeks. The finulc saw Tom
Sullivan throwing it 189 game to
finish up with u 480 for the night.
Jim Loricchio nidcd in the cause
as he threw it 176 to cnd tip a con-

sisteht three gnmc effort of 490.
Loricchio Iliin

Jim‘s score represented the high
three game tally for the Feds while
Sullivan's finale wan for the best
tcn frame score of the locals.

In the other newsworthy match
of the day Union tied with Siena for
the league leadership by shutting
out. ABC.

Senior Soccer
Players Retire

The last shot has been taken and
the last practice ended. The sun
has set on the universal game of
soccer at State, 1956.

There is something about the last
game. the last quarter. the last min—
ute—it seems so long when it is
there but so short in retrospect.
For the Seniors, it was in a sense
an eternity—it will always be a lit-
t e more recent than any other sec-
ond of any other ball game in their
memories.

For Bill Bonesteel it will be the
memory of long hours of sweat and
strain finally recognized in the hon-
or of a co-captainship.

For Bobby Backer. sidelined by an
ankle injury, it is the memory of
his toughest game — the one he
played on the bench. Bob's loss to
the squad was a major factor in
their final loss to Panzer on No-
vember 10, for heart and hope alone
cannot put the ball into the nut.
Bob will always be remembered by
teammates and team pcrsonncl for
the spark behind the club was gcn-
eruted largely by him.

For Tito Guglielmonc, it will be
the memory of his shutout win ovcr
Gencseo to start the scuson; his
spectacular save to rob Pluttsbnrg
of a game winning goal bcforc Siiitc
look it in overtime, and his year as
co-cuptuih of a grout sound.

For Al Ledermnn it is memory of
grout play to win plaudits during
the season only to bc thwarted by
an injury on the final day; for Ray
Castillo. Ev Wcicrinillcr. and Jim
Bailey it is thc memory of satisfy-
ing work for a good reward—u win-
ning season.

WHERE EVERY SANDWICH IS A MEAL!

 

l-‘lukc Decides Union Tilt

It was a fluke goal that provided
the margin in the win for the Gar-
net as Scocco of Union gained the
distinction of being the only per-
son to score upon the Feds while
lying flat on his face. The 100-1
chance came when an attempted
pass glanced off a State player and
caught Tito Guglielinone off guard
as he never had a chance on the
scrcehcd ball from his left.

The angels must have been in
the halfback and fullback slots in
the second half of that ball game
when shots that would score any
other time didn't score and Eddie
Koubcck's best effort of the season
was nun-rod when he lost a great
scoring opportunity in the third
period.

So went the Union game on a
goal in the second period by Scoc-
co to halt a five game win streak
and make the season record 6-2.

On Saturday the chilly field at
Panzer College was the scene of the
ninth and final game of the 1956
season. The 5-2 score at the final
whistle being in Panzer's favor. It
was Ev Weiermiller and Bill Bone-
stch who hit the scoring range for
State in an inspired second half
which was overshadowed by a poor
first half in which the Purple spot—
ted the Maroon three goals to trail
4-1 at the midway mark.

Bill Bohesteel's penalty kick in
the third period made the score 4-2 l
until the fifth and final goal was
milled in the fourth period by Pan-
.zcr to complete the scoring.
