The Weave . . .

The master tailor, in fashioning a suit of
clothes, attempts to weave various threads
into his work which will, when completed,
be admired by all as an example of his

craftsmanship.

This college may be likened to a tailor
at his work. It attempts, through a wide
range of courses, to weave a ﬁnal product
which will be admired by all —a good
teacher. In its work, the college uses three
basic threads. First, realizing that a well-
rounded teacher’s education must be wide
in scope, it offers a program of liberal edu-
cation. The second thread used is what is
commonly known as the “major-minor
ﬁeld. This thread gives a student the. op—
portunity to select and study the subjects
he wishes eventually to teach. The thll‘d,
the professional thread, is composed of
Education courses which enable a student
to acquire the mechanics and philosophy

of his chosen career.

These three threads are individually im-
portant, but when they are strongly woven
together they become the wor .
man, for then the student has gained total

education.

third thread. We urge the members of the
Class of 1960 to take an active interest in
these meetings, for your future success as
a teacher will depend to a large extent on
what you derive from these courses. Some
may underestimate the value of Education
courses, but when their time comes to prac-

tice teach, they will quickly
error.

You have, in your three short months
here, acquired the ﬁrst two threads. It IS

Council was confused about the proper for-
mula for wine, women and freshmen.

After intelligent and mature discussion,
Inter-Fraternity Council decided that at
parties held at the fraternity house when
women were present liquor was not to be
served. This same prohibitive ruling was
made concerning rush parties for freshmen.
When most freshmen come to college they
are not experienced and mature in their
attitude concerning liquor. At rush parties
upperclassmen want to impress the fresh-_
men. Consequently there is the danger of
over-indulgence in alcoholic refreshment.

A logical continuation of this topic isthc
use of alcohol at recognized social functions
of the college.

Let’s Not Kid Ourselves

As I was reading the November 18
edition of the Times-Union, my
eyes fell upon a short article about
liberal education and John Dewey
by Dr. Ruth Alexander.

Among other accomplishments,
Dr. Alexander is a lecturer and edi-
torial columnist and presently is
with the New York Mirror.

The article under the heading
'Our America" entitled “Liberal
Education Blamed for Woes" ex-
pressed my views so thoroughly that
I sth to present it to you in its
entirety:

“It is almost as dangerous to par-
ticularize as it is to generalize. But
here I go. If one man can be said
to be responsible for the restlessness
of many men. that man is John
Dewey. the ‘progressive’ educator."

“By our taste in ‘literature.’ our
crime curve, our divorce rau‘. our
desperate efforts to escape reality
through the shoddy mcdia oi shal-
low entertainment. by the urgency
that sends us scouting like mad over
faster and faster highways. by the
indict-s of our lives "

By JOHN BUCIIAL ’57

“This lack of self discipline is
'raceable directly to our educa-
tional theories and practices. Short-
ly after the turn of the century.

ment upon the traditional disci-
plines of scholars by his concept

Student Teacher Slates Education Course Benefits,-

Preporolory Elements Aid In Professional Skill

In looking backward at the end
of the student teaching experience,
most of us tend to spend a little
time in wondering why we reacted
the way we did in this somewhat
strange and enomious task. All of
us came to NYSCT four years ago
pretty much in the same boat. We
were high school students, but in
no way trained or conditioned,
scholastically or psychologically, to
be classroom teachers. And yet most
of us. during the professional sem-
ester, were respectcd and fairly
capable members of our high school
faculties, off campus and on. The
obvious question. then. is this: what
elements of our preparation here
helped us to gain the necessary
equipment to move from our adoles-
cent unpreparedness to the adult
understanding of adolescents which

has made us capable of teaching
them?

Of course. a great deal of this
change in us during our four years
of college is wrought by years. The
college years give us so much of
poise and initiative. Then too. in-
tense concentration in one or two
chosen areas make us more expert
in handling subject matter. But we
teach neither poise nor content. We
teach children through both.

It seems to me that the logical
basis for skill in a profession would
be professional education. Let's look
at Education 20 and 21.

The major area of concentration
in Education 20 is the philosophy of
our American Education system,
while Education 21 is concerned
largely with the psychology of
adolcsccnts and of learning. Both of

Survey Of Middle East Nations
Shows Few Gains For Russia

By DONALD DAME

Miich has been said and written
of Russia‘s influence among Middle
East nations. Just what is the line-
up? Is she the dominant figure she
is supposed to be? When we speak
of the Middle East nations, we are
usually talking about Turkey, Iran,
Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia. Israel,
Egypt. Syria, and Jordan. The West-
ern powers have a definite interest
in the productive oil fields in these
countries.

Turkey, an ally of the Western
nations. is the eastern member of
NATO. Its army of 500,000 men is
the best in the area. Turkey is a
secularizcd Moslcm nation and is
very friendly to the U. S. The na-
tion has a population of 24,110,000,
and tends to side with Britain over
the Cyprus dispute. Turkey has no
love for Nasser‘s government be-
cause Nasser opened the door to
Russia in the Middle East.

Iran Favors West

Iran, with a population of 21,146.-
000, is a Moslcm state ~— not an
Arab state. The country's premier
is a former ambassador to the
U. S. and is our good friend.
The Shah has firm control of his
country. On a recent trip to the
Krcimlin he ably defended his coun-
try’s membership in the anti-Com-
munist Baghdad Pact. American of-
i‘iccrs hpr train the army and Ani—

been Egypt‘s chief rival for leader'—
sliip of the Arab nations. The Iraq
strongman. Nuri es-Said, is Britain's
best Arab friend in the area. Re-
cently Nuri announced under na-
tionalist pressure that Iraq would
boycott all Baghdad Pact meetings
attended by Britain, and he told
the U. S. privately that if he is to
survive he must disengage himself"
from Britain.
Lebanon Retains Relations
Lebanon, With a population of 1,-
425,000, is the smallest Arab coun-
try. Off'icially. Lebanon is pro-U. S.
It is the only Arab nation which has

Saudi Arabia has a population of

the most absolute ruler in the world,
is strongly anti-Communist. He Is
definitely pro-U. S., relying for 90';
of his total revenue on oil from the
American owned Arabian American
Oil Company. Sand is a Nasser ally,
but he doesn't approve of the na-
tionalization of the Canal because
he feels that it will endanger his
oil profits. Saud also dislikes Nas-
scr's dealings with ilic Russians.

atc and public funds. France is pres-

the Middle East notions. Russia's
Middle East ambitions are real. bilt
her ucconiplishiiicnis are not.

these are fields that students can-
not know much about. When I
found myself in a little farming
community sixty miles off campus,
I was very glad to know that the
first job of a teacher is to penpetu-
ate the culture of the society which
founds the school.

So many questions come up every
day in relation to marking, promo-
tion or grouping, that a personal
philosophy of education is a must
for any kind of realistic handling
of this problem. Education 20 with
its informal airing of many differ-
ent viewpoints. is the ideal place
to come up with a fairly clear idea
of what our schools should do for
our kids.

Of real. though secondary, im-
portance to us as student teachers
is an understanding of the commu-
nities we have been placed in. Ed—
ucation 20 comes to the rescue again
by teaching us how to evaluate a
community‘s resources.

I think most of us found our re-
lationship with studenls the most
enjoyable part of student teaching.
We found them very refreshing,
crciitivc, fun loving and unpredict-
able. but we coped with them fairly
successfully for tyvo reasons. First
of all, most of us. by our very na—
ture. like to work with children. But
more important, Education 21 did
a fine job of keeping us in touch
with adolescents and increasing our
understanding of them. Through
study of adolescent psychology. the
psychoiogy of learning. and the phy-
sical. social and emotional develop-
ment of children, we became aware
of the needs which these children
find so difficult to understand
themselves. We learned to treat
them as individuals and evaluate
them on the basis of their indivi-
dual development toward adulthood.

Even more important, the observa-
tion program kept us in touch with
the high school classroom.

It comes as a brutal blow to most
student teachers during that fatal
first week that high school stu-
dents, so close to us in age, are so
different in behavior. We forget
that it is impossible for ninth grad-
ers to sit still for an hour. We can't
believe that a seventh grader must
sharpen her pencil seven times in
one study hall. We are unaware of
the behind—the-sccncs conferences
which go on every day for the wel-
fare of individual children.

Much of the insight into children
comes with time. Be thankful for
what you do know about children
and remember, though you may not.
realize ll. most of what we do know
about our students come from Edu-
cation 20 and 21.

Albany State is undemocratic!

What do you think of a school
that doesn’t let students vote on an
issue that directly concerns them;
an issue that could change the very
course of their lives?

I hate to be the one to tattle, but
your school is doing just this thing!
In a moment, an explanation, but
first, tline out for . . . HATE. Ready

. all together , . . We hate AI-
baiiy State!

Okay, now that that’s out of our

Council Discusses

 

PLOTNIK

system I’ll explain what's going on
behind your backs. The students of
Albany Law school are not being
allowed to vote on the S.U.B. issue
concerning outsiders in the Student
Union. When I told one of these
students about it last week. when
we were sitting in Poppa's, he was
furious. He nearly spilled his beer.
He said that if he wasn't given a.
vote, he'd report the whole affair
to his party leader, Nikita Kruschev.

If this revelation leaves you cold,
I have more. This is the kind of’
thing we need—specific reasons to
hate our school. Admittedly, it's fun
to despise State, but some day you‘ll
be asked why. and if you save these
columns like every good American
does, you’ll know.

Reason two: Albany State is un-
realistically prudish. Take each stu-
dent individually, and you don‘t re-
alize it. You can tell him a bawdy
joke. and he’ll laugh. You can ask
him to tell one, and he will. You'll
laugh. Yet. take these indiViduals.
put them together in Page Hall. and
they suddenly become subjected to
a censored world of hypocrisy,
whether they like it or not, and I
honestly feel that they don‘t like it.
Who does like being treated like a
naive child? If you don't quite un-
derstand. perhaps the nature of the
State College Revue~year after year
wwill clarify things.
