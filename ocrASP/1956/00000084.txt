By ART PALAZZOLO

STRAND

Giant with Elizabeth Taylor, Rock
Hudson. James Dean, Jane Withers,
Chill Wills, Mercedes McCambridge
and Sal Mineo. Taken from the
novel by Edna Ferber, it is the
sprawling story of the sprawling
state of Texas and the results of
the discovery of oil. Liz and Rock
meet and marry in the East, and
move to a Texas ranch. James Dean
is their hired hand. As a result of
the death of Rock’s sister, Jimmy
inherits a small parcel of land, dis-
covers oil on it and becomes wealthy
overnight. He acquires more trou-
bles than he had when poor. A
good movie. but it drags in parts—
over three and a half hours long.
This pic has been compared with
“Gone With the Wind"—don't be-
lieve it——it wasn't that good!

PALACE

The Opposite Sex with June Ally-
son, Ann Sheridan, Ann Miller and
girls ad finitum. It's a musical-
comedy with Sam Levene, and he’s
funny! The second smash hit is
These Wilder Years with James
Cagney and Barbara Stanwyck.
MADISON

Attack with Jack Palance and
Eddie Albert. Not a run-of—the-mill
war movie, nor is it for a squeamish
audience. Highly recommended. The
second feature is Rebel in Town
with John Payne and Ruth Roman.
This is a good picture to come in
the middle of—better yet, five min-
utes before the ending.
DELAWARE

The Silent World. In color. A
French documentary with English
narration. A wonderful picture of
undersea explorations. Received so
well it's being held over another
week.

RS.

For those among us who desire a
night steeped in culture, the RPI
Field House is playing host to the
NBC presentation of Madame But-
terfly, this Tuesday at 8:45 pm. All
seats are reserved and tickets may
be purchased at the Van Curler
Music Store on State Street.

Rearmed Rew'ew '
By FRANK VE'I‘OSKY

Classical Reviews

A new Camden long playing rec-
ord features Arturo Toscanini con-
ducting the New York Philharmonic
in works by Brahms, Rossini, Mo-
zart and Mendelssohn. The record-
ing contains "Variations On A
Theme By Haydn," “Barber Of Se-
ville Overture," “Haffner Sym-
phony" and “Scherzo From Mid-
summer Night's Dream." Since these
items were cut some years ago. the
sound isn't up to present (lay hi-fi
standards. However this package
presents Toscanini in the twilight
of his career.

Carl Schurlcht conducts the Vi-
enna Philharmonic Orchestra in
Schubert's “Symphony No. 8" and
Mozart‘s “Symphony No. 35" on an
LP recently released by London.
Backing these two popular items on
it single record was ii brilliant more
by the label. While there are several
versions of each selection currently
available, this outstanding perform-
ance is hard to match.

Another Camden album just rc-
lcased is titled “The Art of Guiseppe
De Luca." Included in this program
arc arias froth “Ii Trovutorc" and
"Faust." As in the Toscanini LP,
thcsc selections were originally re-
leased as singles years back, For—
tunately, however. the rich voice of
the artist is nevertheless preserved.

Popular Recordings

Jackie Gleason, noted comedian
and maestro, does a superb job
conducting his orchestra on a new
Capitol Christmas album titled
"Merry Christmas." Two of the se-
lections included are “Whitc Christ-
mas" and “Winter Wonderland.”
Rich support is given to the work
by a chorus which tastefully bums
in the background. For those who
enjoy lush music, this one is it must.

Julie (Cry Me A Rth‘l‘l London
has solid potential in her new Lib-
i-rty rclcasc “Calendar Girl." Julie
swcctly stylus ll song for each month
of the year plus "The 'l‘hirtecnth
Month," it new song written especi-
iilly for the album. If you like il
"class" songstrcss singing at her
best. you‘ll really dig this wiix.
