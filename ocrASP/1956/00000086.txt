Luckies Taste Better

 CLEANER, FRESHER, SMOOTHER I

The weekend of November 16 we
were sent as part of the Albany
delegation to Buffalo State Teach-
ers' College to attend the Inter-
Collegiate Association conference.
At this conference there were rep-
resentatives from nine state teach-
ers' colleges. The conference was
mainly concerned with the future
of ICA, should it continue, and if
continued, what should be its goals.
The reason for doubt about ICA's
future was that we had never
scratched the surface of the Asso—
ciation's potential. In previous
years, ICA had failed because it
was kept on an idealistic plane and
had never touched the individual
student. At this year’s conference,
we decided to explore ICA and find
where its forces are combined in
state teachers‘ colleges, i.e. in what
fields our interests are similar and
how we can get each individual to
receive the benefits of ICA.

It was mutually agreed that dif—
ferences between state teachers'
colleges are permanent because of

their individuality in curriculum.
But common ties are the following:

1) Many people attending state
teachers' colleges are first genera-
tion college students.

2) The majority of these people
are from the same economic
bracket.

At this conference we decided
that ICA definitely has a future. To
maintain ICA it was pointed out
that definite means of communica-
tions should be provided among the
colleges. From this time on, defin-
ite names and addresses of mem-
bers from state teachers’ colleges
will be posted. to be available to
every individual and organization.
For instance, if a religious club
wanted specific information on how
a religious club at Potsdam was
financing its work. the head of the
organization could secure the name
and address of the person to write
to at Potsdam by referring to this
list.

ciently handled from one college to

another and this system of organi-
zations communicating with similar
organizations on other campuses
will form a closer tie between
schools. Moreover, besides solving
specific organizational problems,
ICA will effect every student on
stands taken by the State Univer-
sity on issues concerning all the
schools. Before ICA can take a.
side on these issues, it is evident
the organization will have to be
strengthened, and this strength will
be secured as ICA becomes an ac-
tive organization on each campus.
At this conference, we. as Albany
delegates, made some discoveries
which concerned particularly Al-
bany. First, we concluded that some
of our “problems” have never exist—
ed. We have been trying to formu-
late “problems” about such situa-
tions as poor attendance at out-
side events, and the general atti-
tude toward student government.
For the number of activities offered
every week at this college, there is
excellent attendance, considering
the type of students; those work-
ing. married, und those with their
individual interests.
From discussion at Buffalo. we
concluded that not all students are
interested in student government or
its workings, but are interested in
their college! Agreeing with n sug-
gestion offered at this conference,
it is possible that Albany has too
much to offer for the student for
Wliut free time is allowed him.
When some activity concerns the
individual student. then he is iii-
terested.
We sincerely feel that ICA has a
future if its goals are kept on rr
realistic level. Albany will benefit
from ICA only if it helps to streng-
then ICA initially by communicat-
ing with the other colleges, and if
it works toward the exchanging of
college groups such as choral, dra-
matic, and athletic. among others.

Past President
Of State College
Dies At Eighty

Dr. John Manville Sayles, State
College’s President from 1939 to
1949, died Monday in Albany Hos-
pital at the age of 80.

The former President’s long ca-
reer in education began in 1902,
when he was appointed principal of
the high school in Richmondville,
N. Y. After a short time as princi-
pal of the high school at Glens
Falls in 1905, he was recalled to the
Normal College as principal of the
Model School, known since 1907 as
the Milne High School. Although
his first appointment was an in-
terim one, during the leave of ab-
sence of the former principal, he
was soon appointed to the position
permanently.

Dr, Sayles remained principal of
the model school from 1905 to 1939,
when he was appointed acting presi-
dent of the college. From 1920 to
1939. he was also director of teach—
er training and head of the De-
partinent of Education. In 1937, Col-
gate University conferred upon him
the degree of doctor of pedagogy.
fwo years, then, after he had been
appointed acting president, Dr.
Sayles was recognized as tenth
President of the College.

It is given to few men. particu-
larly in the field of education, to
make so great and so long a con-
tribution to one institution as Dr.
Sayles has made to the State Col-
lege.

Foremost among his contributions
is the erection of the Alumni resi-
dence halls, Pierce and Sayles Halls.
Ground was broken in the autumn
of 1940 and Dr. Sayles was the
honored guest at the placing of the
cornerstone.

Wednesday at 2 pm. there was a
special convocation to honor Dr.
Sayles. Funeral services were held
Wednesday afternoon at the First
Presbyterian Church, State and
Willett Streets.

We invite your attention to a let-
ter addressed to all students in the

November 6 edition of the Chicago
Tribune. This message from the stu-
dents of' the Technical University

lows:

“Dear Friends: We thank you
with full hearts for the sympathy
and support you have shown for
our fight for freedom against Soviet
.iLﬁHl'lfSSlOll and communist despot-
ism. For the sons of the free world
it is almost impossible to imagine
the diabolical world of iiiuuisition
and torture, or oppression, or inur-
(It‘l‘. or the lies to which we have
been subjected. Help us with your
petitions, your words, your demon-
srr-utions, your resolutions."

In answer to this pica, we, the
undersigned students of the New
York State College for 'I‘crrehers at
Albany, New York, USA, forward
this petition to you, in the hope
rhirt you will use your liillllciit'c in
the Unitrxl Nations and the
USSR. to provide for the safety
and well—being of these people.

We write this to you its students
pin'tlculrn'ly shocked by the brutality
of the Soviet military in dealing
with Hungarian students who are
seeking academic freedom for them—
selves filltl the right of self-govern-
ment for their people.

We are sending ii copy of this
letter to our representative in the
United Nations, Mr. Henry Cabot
Lodge, in recognition of the rim:
work he has done in i'egur'd to the
Hungarian situation within the
workings of the UN.

We appreciate the fact that you
are in a better position than any
other world leader to inedlritc iii
behalf of the Hungarian people,

We desire desperately that the
struggle of these people shall not
go unrewarded.

Jazz Sextet in
Page Assembly

There will be a non-legislative
and therefore non-compulsory con-
vocation today at 10 am. in Page
Auditorium, announces Marilyn
Leach '58, Chairman of Convoca-
tions Committee. A progressive jazz
group organized by Zacharie Clem-
ents ’59 will comprise the program.

Included in the combo are Joseph
Rotondaro, Leo Russo, James King,
and three students from the col-
lege, Jerry Stickies and Clyde
Payne, Seniors, and Zacharie
Clements '59.

Joseph Rotondaro, who has ap-
peared in local night spots, will
provide the piano background for
the band and also sing several of
the vocals. Leo Russo is a promising
musician from the west coast and
is currently playing at Troy's "The
Cat and the Fiddle." He is playing
the flute, a recent experiment in
progressive jazz. James King, the
trombonist of the group, has also
entertained in the Albany area.

Jerry Stickies '57 will add his
bass to the sextet, and Clyde Payne
'57 will accompany with his drums.
The arranger of the concert, Clem-
ents, will play the saxaphone. He
has helped to arrange several jam
sessions in the last two years in
Brubacher Hail and for Greek
houses on campus.

This is the third in a series of
iron - legislative convocations in
which organizations and private in-
dividuals may plan the program for
the meeting. Thus far, Forum Board
of Poiitics has sponsored a speaker,
and the Dramatic and Arts Affili-
ates has presented a one-act play
featuring the members of its organ-
ization.

Next week, the traditional Christ-
mas choral program will be held in
convocation. At that time the
statesmen, the Choralettes, the
Collegiate Singers, and the Women's
