In Memoriam . . .

In behalf of the members of Student
Association we would like to express our
sorrow to the administration and faculty
on the death of Dr. John M. Sayles, the
tenth President of our college.

Most of us have never known Dr. Sayles
personally and yet we feel this loss. How
much greater must be the sorrow of those
who knew and worked with this great edu-
cator during his long years of service to
the New York State College for Teachers,

Albany.

Student Council has now come up with
the most logical solution to this problem—
dc away with the organizations which are
only supported by a minority, in order that
the larger, active organizations can con-
tinue their progress. Council is attempting
to accomplish this by requiring existing
budgetary groups to submit a report to
Council every third year. This report must
include a list of active members, the num-
ber attending meetings, activities sponsor-
ed and the general support of these activi-
ties. If Council feels that the group does
not beneﬁt enough members of Student

A similar report will be required for all

This system will permit a representative
group of Student Association to judge the
value of an organization. This will give us
a chance to weed out useless and expensive

organizations.

This week we would like to recommend
the recent action of Student Board of Fi-
nance to the entire student body. They as
a group upheld their previous conviction
and did not merely accept a motion pre~
sented by Student Council.

made a concerted effort to hold tighter
reins on the conference lines in organiza-

There was evidence last year

that organizations which had a lump sum

line for conferences tended to misuse the
Student Tax money. Therefore, Student
Board of Finance clamped down and they

now require all groups to submit an accu-
rate line breakdown in their spring budget
and also present hotel and restaurant re—
ceipts with their vouchers when returning
from the conference.

At Student Council last week a hurried
motion was made to request a lump sum
appropriation of one hundred dollars from
surplus to cover expenses for the two dele-
gates to the New York State Regional Con-
ference of the National Student Association
conference this weekend. It was estimated
that ﬁfty-four dollars would be sufﬁcient
to cover expenses.
hundred dollars just to be safe.

Council seemed to forget that we are a
state supported school. Supposedly all our
students come from middle-income fami-
lies. It is of prime importance that we keep
our student activity fee as low as possible.
Students who attend conferences should be
made to keep their expenses down to a
minimum. They should have enough money
to live comfortably but not luxuriously. It
is the responsibility of Student Board of
Finance to insure this thriftiness.

This week SBF defeated Student Coun-

cil’s request and recommended that they

expenses before their receive an appropria-
tion. The alert members of Student Board
of Finance have crushed this dangerous

and liberal precedent.

Dewey Misinferpreled

In last week’s issue of the State
College News there appeared an
article deriding the educational
philosophy of John Dewey. I dis-
agreed heartily with the implica-
tions of that article, and it is my
contention that the author either
has not read the works of Dewey,
or else he has read into it that which
he wished to believe in the first
place. I wish, therefore, to defend
Dewey with direct quotes from his
book. Experience and Education.

It is true that Dewey opposes the
harsh disciplinary practices of trad-
itional education. Traditional class-
room authority was externally con-
trolled and did not take into ac-
count tlie needs and desires of ion—
matlire human beings. He does not
imply, as some people seem to
think, that authority should be
eliminated. but that it should come
more from within the student.
Students should have the opportu-
nity to know the reason why and
not just to do or die. The child
should not be merely ordered what

By RICIIARD WEMPLE ’57
not to do and what to do, as was
the usual precedure in traditional
classrooms, but that he should learn
this through the guidance and ex-
amples of his teachers.

Some people seem to have the
notion that Dewey suggests that
any experience which might be pur—
posely or accidentally provided for
the child is educative. To the con-
trary, Dewey writes, “the belief
that all genuine education comes
about through experience does not
mean that all experiences are gen-
uinc y or equally educative. Experi-
ences and education cannot be di-
iectly equated to each other. For
some experiences are nits-educative

. Everything depends upon the
quality of the experience which is
bad."

Another mistaken notion about
Dcwcys philosophy is that he stig-
gcstcd that education should be
spontaneous and complctcly un-
planned. This is not true, He feels
that "ti'iiditioniil cdiication was a
matter of routine in which the plans

To the Editor:

Who's kidding who? We are re—
i'crriiig' to the article which appear-
ed on last week’s editorial page
concerning Dr. Ruth Alexander's
opinions of progressive education.
In her article she attempts to criti—
cize it without a full understanding
of the philosophy.

'I‘wo prominent misconceptions oi
progressive education, that children
are turned lmse to do what they
please and that there is no planned
curriculum. are brought forth in
an interview of Dr. William Kil-
patrick, a leading educator, in the
New York Times, November iii.

Progressive educators strive for
self—discipline among their students.
This is done by utilizing students'
interests and abilities. Furthcmiorc,
the intelligent progressive teacher
will direct and guide her pupils to-
ward a well-rounded school program.

th, Dr. Alexandr-r blames thcsc
methods for the increase in juvenile
delinquency; the number of dclin—
quents in proportion to the total
number of American youth is cx-
trcincly small.

it Dr. Alexander fully uiulcrstands
the philosophy of progressive cdu~
cation, she would realize that "mass
production" is the direct opposite of
what it advocates, and that stress
is placed on iiidivuluai nccds.

it the human product of progres-
sive education is "illiterate," how is
it possible that so much progress
has been made in the fields of
medicine, engineering, transporta-
tion, etc, in the last two deciidcs'.l

We hope that our children have
the opportunity of becoming all
they are capable of being. This, Dr.
Alexander, is progressive educa-
tion!

Lois Johnson ’57

and programs were handed down
from the past." There was not
enough effort to relate the past to
the problems of the present and
the future. Would he have us throw
out the values of the customs mid
traditions of the past? Definitely
not. He would use as subject-matter
events and materials of the past,
but he would have us select the ones
most significant to our own times.

The above things are a small
sampling of the mild and logical
philosophy of John Dewey. It is my
opinion that this philosophy is sin-
ccrc and not the radical, uiibciidiiig
statement which some make it out
to be. Dewey himself points out the
danger of swinging to the opposite
cxtrcinr iroin traditional cduca-
tioii. "There is always the danger
in it hcw iiichiiicnt that in reject—
ing the aims and methods of that
which it would supplant, it may
develop its principles negatively
rather than positively and construc-
ti\cly. Then it takes its ('lL‘W Isicl
in practice from that winch is re-
ji-ctcd instead of from the construc-
tiyc dcrclopincni, of its own philos-
iijilly."

It. is iiiportant and relevant that
all of us realize why l)i-wcy wrote
this book, Experience and Educa-
tion, from which i hitvc quoted. He
himself feels that many educators
under the guise oi progressive edu-
cation hch lostcrcd "chaotic (‘lll'l'l-
culurii, cxccssivc individualism, and
u spontaneity which is a dcccptivo
iiidcx oi lrccdoin." He felt that iiib‘
philosophy must have been coni—
plctciy inisuiuicrstood and in order
to combat this iiiisuiulcrstaiiding he
wrote, Experienci- and Education.

Finally, it is cqually as important
for us to realizc that Dchy him—
self feels that the critical process
should remain iii Vogue in our soci-
cty. lie would encourage criticism
of his cdliciitioniil philosophy, but
Would hope that the critic Would
use the scientific method and under—
stiind that which he is criticizing.
i do not feel that last Week's article
was written in the light of this
critical process,

VERBAL BOUQUETS

In reference to last week‘s editorial or should we call it the "Down
with Demon Rum" plea of the WCTU?
To us this epitomizes a number of things. First, the pi'udish atti-
tude of seine of the students in this school. Secondly, the differentiation
between State and the tuition schools on this item. Thirdly, the “im-
mature” war cry, "they can‘t handle their hours, liquor, money, etc."
Fourthly, the eloquent minority, who in the college News speak for one
side of the issue, the minority side.
Granted, this editorial would have been warranted if the situation
was such as the article would have one believe.
As far as public relations go—sounds rare for a school that has been
completely obliVious to further any such relations to suddenly advocate
picayune. prudish, public relations.
Our only comment is, “Let each one become what he is capable of."
We're not joking, either.
WATCII DOG'S BARK IS WORSE THAN HIS BITE
We read in last week's News a request for students to bring their
student handbooks to the convocation to facilitate voting on the amend-

ments of the Watchdog Committee.

  

 

By the looks of the student mail

boxes this week there weren’t too many handbook carriers last Friday.
Maybe it was a good thing since two amended sections pertaining to
two different things were passed under one motion.

’I‘IIE IMPOSSIBLE

This year there will be 150 more freshman girls than the sorority
quotas will be able to accommodate. There is no need for this. Expan-
sion and progress in one ﬁeld in order to be of any value, necessitates
progress all the way down the line. If our enrollment expands it stands
to reason that so should the other institutions in the school.

Increasing the number of members in sororities is highly impractical
in that the houses are too small to accommodate such a move.

The idea of forming a new sorority has been kicked around for quite
a while, how about some action now?

GOOD PLANNING

Also included in last week’s Student Coiiiicll report were plans to

send delegates to

the National Student Association

conference. It

seems the NSA was thoroughly and finally investigated two years ago.
Council voted not to join or invostigatc it again for ii numbcr of years.

State Educator Relutes Criticism Deon Releases
OI Progressive Education Theory New Date For

By DR. MORRIS BERGER
Associate Professor of Education

Recently, your paper reprinted an
article by Dr. Ruth Alexander en-
titled “Liberal Education Blamed
For "oes." The student who uncov-
ered this gem of truth seemed to
express a great sense of joy that
at last someone had the courage
and intelligence to tell us the “real
story."

Actually, Dr. Alexander's state-
ment reveals an ignorance of the
nature of “progressive education"
and a complete misunderstanding
of the philosophy of John Dewey.
The heart of the argument present-
cd is that because we have been
subjected to “progressive education"
we now lack self—discipline. The
logic that follows is that because
we do lack this quality of self-dis—
cipline, Elvis Presley “grinds,”
Johnny remains illiterate and crime
is rampant.

Delinquency World Problem

How flattering it is to think that
the public schools are so powerful
that they can be ‘wld responsible
for all our troubl's Atom-bombs,
a universe totterii j" on the “brink
of disaster," a new atomic world
that has revolutionized our lives as
well as our scientific constructs——
all these elements are irrelevant. If
the schools were less progressive
our social problems would quickly
melt, thaw, and resolve themselves
into a dew. What intelligent, clear-
t.hinking person, be he friend or foe
of our public schools, would dare
attribute so much to our schools?
How curious it also is that these
social problems are not restricted
to “progressive” America. How
curious it is that UNESCO reports
that juvenile delinquency has be—
come a problem throughout the
world. And, mind you, this problem
of social degeneration also exists in
countries that stress “traditional
education” and discipline.

Discipline Vital

But we must still answer to the
qticstion. How much of the blame
hllllllld fall upon Dewey and his
'lattcr-day saints"? If any one thing
can be claimed for Dewey and his
'gang" it is that they have fought
to destroy “permissive” education.
Dewey, throughout his writings, at-
tacked thc so-called "progressch
cduciitors“ who stressed permissive-
ncss as much as he criticized the
"traditionalists." Dewey contended
that the concept of "romantic nat-
lll‘llllr'lll.” the idea of letting the
child alone. directly contradicted all
our lillfii‘l‘Si.llll(lllli£,S about the nu—
turc of learning. human psychology,

This is the era of criticism for
American public education. Today,
as never before, the American
school is being examined and re-
appraised. Those who believe in our
public school system cannot, in all
fairness, ignore or reject the grow-
ing criticisms. More than anyone
else the friend of public education
will acknowledge the fact that our
schools can be improved. We must
all work to make our schools better
institutions of learning. But at the
same time we cannot ignore those
who unjustly attack the schools.
The type of criticism that Dr. Alex-
ander presents is destructive. Dr.
Alexander has dared to attack the
schools and progressive education
without first attempting to discover
what Dewey and other educators
have actually said. We welcome in-
vestigation and criticism of our
schools, but we make the request
that a person know of what he
speaks. Dr. Alexander has not read
John Dewey. Dr. Alexander does
not know the meaning of progres-
sive education.

Dangerous Distortions

The tragedy of it all is that peo-
ple read the distortions that Dr.
Alexander presents. These thous-
ands upon thousands of readers are
the parents and citizens who sup-
port our schools. What will they
conclude? That our schools are not
good, that our teachers are mis-
educating our children, that public
education has been corrupted by
the philosophy of experimentalism.

Our public schools have always
been considered the sine qua non of
American democracy. The Ameri-
can public school is the American
dream, the positive proof that equal-
ity of opportunity does exist, the
cxpresscd faith in the worth and
dignity of every child. Every day in
every part of this country thousands
of devoted educators struggle to im—
prove public education. They teach
children, they re—cxamine curricula,
they conduct experiments, they re-
ject notions no longer useful. And
in Working for the perpetuation of
our public schools the American ed-
ucator will always stand and correct
the kinds of untruths that Dr. Al-
exander and her gang present.

In the following poem, the author,
an up-and-coming genius, pays tri-
bute to the enlightened spirit of
modern jazz at State, and parallels
this morning's convocation demon-
strating the modern idiom in an
exciting branch of contemporary

Vachel Lindsay have expressed the
emotions of early American jazz.

The tone of their work has been
loud and hard-hitting as was the
music about which they wrote. The
