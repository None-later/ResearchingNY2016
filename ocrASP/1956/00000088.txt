Freshman Members Stage Skit,-
President Supports Shorter Recess

By NANCY

Student Council meeting was
opened by Clyde Payne, President,
who called first on the new fresh-
man members to present their skit.
Council seemed to enjoy immensely
the parts played by Herbert Walther
as narrator, Joan Cali as Hero
Stan, Katherine O’Connor as the
villain, Patricia Gengo as Dear
Daddy, and Robert Helwig as Lil.

Freshmen named to the Consti-
tutional Review Committee were

RICHARDS

Robert Williams and Frank Krivo.
Council members also selected Rob-
ert Helwig and Charles Weed as
representatives to the State College
Revue Committee with Rosemarie
Bordonaro as alternate.

Procedure for the admission of
new organizations on campus has
been remodeled. First of all, there
must be sufficient interest for any
group to organize. Student Council
and Constitutional Review Commit-
tee approval is necessary for both
budget and non-budget groups, and
Student Board of Finance must ap-
prove all that are under the budget.

Clyde Payne clarified for Student
Council the reasons why State Col—
lege students cannot have more
than a one day's extension for their
Christmas vacation. The college
must provide summer sessions for
high school teachers who will start
quite late because of Regents week.
Also, students are required to com-
plete 75 days of classes per semester.
Furthermore basketball games
and banquets on the social calendar
are difficult to re-schedule.

Along with these reasons given to
us by President Collins, he stated
that if a legal excuse is really nec-
essary because of vacation employ-
ment, the student may see one of
the deans concerning it.

ing in the Driver Education course,

fesor of Health and Safety Educa-
tion, in his office in Lower Draper

,,,RemJ Radical“,

By FRANK VETOSKY

Many of the best songs ever writ-

ten have been show tunes. One such
example from “Bells Are Ringing"
is titled “The Party’s Over." There
are several versions available, but
in our opinion the best and most
commercial is Doris Day’s Columbia
etching. Miss Day’s warm personal
style has never captured a lyric
better than on this one.

You've probably heard it by now.
That is, Elvis Presley's Victor plat—
ter “Love Me." As yet this tune
hasn’t been released as a single,
but it is a selection from his new
E.P. “Elvis.” The incredible is hap-
pening, however. The song is rocket-
ing the whole E.P. to the top. For
you anti-Elvisers it might be wise
to buy as many copies as you can
afford, and then destroy them.

CO—OP

 

Others might prefer purchasing
copies to present to their enemies
as Christmas gifts. But no matter
what you personally think of Pres-
ley, this will be another million
sales seeker.

“Moonlight Gambler," a new Co-
lumbia recording by Frankie Laine,
may very well bring the artist back
from oblivion. This is the most com-
mercial material he's had in a very
long time. Laine’s powerful, but re-
served. vocal treatment is something
tc be admired in these dog-days of
the monotoned rock and roller.

Jo Stafford hasn't had a bit since
“Make Love To Me" in 1953. How-
ever her current Columbia waxing,
“On London Bridge," should be the
one which really clicks. The very
singable lyric, done in upbeat tempo
by the sensitive styling of songstress
Stafford, should soar this song to
the crest of popularity. “Bells Are
Ringing" from the musical comedy
of the same name, is the flip side.
The beautiful ballad is handled
perfectly.

Honky-Tonker Bill Doggett does
"Slow Walk" on his new King re-
lease. At present it is walking fast
toward the top.
