looked back on this week‘s 4—0 shut-
out of RPI.

Setters and Rookwood and Minon
of the Peds took scoring honors
with sixteen points apiece.

Holway Hoops 27

With both teams resorting to zone
defenses, the Maritime game was
slow starting as witnessed by the
fact that the score was only 4-4 at
the end of five minutes. State’s
fast breaks began to tell at this
point, and the Peds steadily moved
out in front to take command at
half-time, 34-19. Gary Holway
found the range on tap-ins in the
second half and had rung up 27
markers before Coach Sauers pull-
ed him and the rest of the first
team. The bench strength held on
to the lead built up by the starters,
as the Peds went on to their second
triumph in two days.

l IT’S FOR REAL!

by Chester Field

 

GABRIEL DOOM

real satisfaction of a real smoke

ever, thanks to Acre-Ray.
Take your pleasure big!

 

Once every month Gabriel Doom
Locked himself up in a sound-proof room;
Then he laughed out loud and rocked with glee
At a life that was funny as life could be!
He laughed at the weather, sunny on Monday
. . rainy on Saturday, rainy on Sunday.
He laughed at the news so loaded with grief
that an ax murder came as a pleasant relief!
He cried, “what with worry, hurry, and strife
you couldn’t ask for a funnier life!"

MOIAti In this fast-moving world
it’s good to sit loose, relax and enjoy the

Chesterfield. More real ﬂavor, more
satisfaction and the smoothest smoking
