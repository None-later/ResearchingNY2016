Minerva . . .

Each week on this page of the State College News I,
as editor, print my editorials for you to read. They are
always written in the hope that they will help to formu-
late student opinion and create an interest in student
affairs. As editor I have this privilege of expressing my
point of view.

Each of us in our own way has a certain regard for
State College or otherwise we would not have chosen to
come here. Regardless of our motives for coming here, as a
graduate of this institution we can never forget our alma
mater nor live apart from its accomplishments and fail-
ures. We are an old college having a history one hundred
and twelve years old. Every year writes a new page in the
annals of our history. We are a part of this entire history,
not just of the four years we attend NYSCT.

One of the oldest parts of this long chain of years is
Minerva. The statue which now stands in the Draper
Rotunda was the only article salvaged from the 01d nor-
mal school on Willett Street when the building burned
down nearly one hundred years ago. She is the only tan—
gible gift we have from the earliest building of the college.

Minerva is the goddess of knowledge. She is our spir-
itual symbol that our college is an institution of learning.
This education must stand fast against all attacks. Ml-
nerva is the symbol of this strength. She is strong and un-
touchable. She is more than a mere human.

But this can only be true as long as we, the students,
believe in her. A tradition is only a tradition as long as
we, the students, regard it as a tradition. It takes each
college generation either to preserve or destroy what has
taken ﬁfty to a hundred years to build.

To one group has been given the obligation to guard
these age-old traditions. Each new disregard of tradition
is a new challenge for this judicial body. The seriousness
of this obligation can never be forgotten and each new
challenge requires a thorough decision. More serious de-
cisions require more time to deliberate. All the facts. must
be judged. We gave this judicial body the right to judge.
We must also give them the right to judge well.

In this deliberation they must not only judge the
present, but also the future. They must insure to the stu-
dent body that that which they hold sacred Will not be
trod upon again. We must demand action but we must
also demand that it come from well-deliberated discussmn.

The facts stand before us. Minerva is our symbol of
learning, she is our oldest tradition. As Seniors and Alum-
ni we wear her on our rings. She is the visible remembrance
that we carry with us every day after we graduate from
State College. Her sacredness can not be violated again.
This is the issue involved. This is why we must seek ac-
tion against all those who were involved in her removal.

A Spiritual Bond . . .

Student Associations in every college throughout the
nation are taking positive action to aid the cause of
Hungary. Today the United Nations condemned the action
of Russia.

We and the students of Hungary are joined together
in a spiritual brotherhood. It is the often-told tale of
“Students Helping Students." Today these students need
our help more than ever before. In Hungary their freedom
is being suppressed, yet they are not afraid to fightfor
what they believe in. To do this they have been extled
from their native country.

Now they need our material help to continue their
education in another country. We can help by giving to
the collection that will be taken up Sunday at the Christ-
mas Sing to support their cause.

MINERVA

 

By ART PALAZZOLO

STRAND

Teenage Rebel with Ginger Rog-
ers, Michael Rennie and Betty Lou
Keim. In CinemaScope. The title
promises much more action than the
picture contains. Ginger Rogers, a
divorcee, marries Michael Rennie.
Her daughter by her first marriage
visits her and both Ginger and Mike
bend over backwards to gain her
affection —- which, naturally, she
doesn't give them. It seems her real
papa. whom she adoresi wants to
dump her . . . and all this makes
for a very mixed up and heart-
rendering situation. Everything
works out fine in true Hollywood
fashion. Also showing is Flight to
I-Ioni,r Kong with Rory Calhoun and
Barbara Rush.
PALACE

Odonga with Rhonda Fleming
and Macdonald Carey, In Cinema-
Scope and Technicolor. “Adventure
on the African Frontier." Africa is
a dark and mysterious continent,
(we learned this in Geo. 4i so see
this picture and be thrilled. The
second feature is 7th Cavalry with
old parchment face himself—Ran-
dolph Scott. This picture goes to
show that just because a man is
over 50, he can still ride a horse at
a full gallop, jump from second-
story saloon windows. and clout un-
couth louts all over the place. The
moral of this picture: don‘t fool
with Randy!
DELAWARE

Private‘s Progress with Ian Car-
michael. The hilarious story of the
British Army and the men who
proved that no matter from what
country, every army has its share
of bungling goldbricks.

son. and James Dean. If you have
not yet seen it, don't worry. It’ll

JOIIN DEWEY

Departing from the run of the full] articles usually carried by the
News ilast week renamed the Educational Review: we should like to
speak of a non-academic matter not directly affecting educational
philosophy. The sentiment to be conveyed concerns athletics. The Page
telephone booth annex seems a mite small to accommodate the crowds
eager to watch the Ped hoopers. There ain't no justice. If we have
people we don't have the room. If we have the room we don‘t have the
people.

Also the Milne gym. to which the State wrestlers have been exiled
for their varsity contests. seems slightly small for such big efforts.

Why not borrow the education department's and televisc State

NSA Conference Shows State

Behind in Governmental System SecondSemesi‘er

By NANCY SCHNEIDER and DONALD McCLAIN

The United States National Stu-
dent Association (USNSA) is a con-
federation of college student bodies
represented through their student
governments. It has 300 member
schools, representing 600.000 college
students and is the most represent-
ative student organization in this
country.

Last. weekend the New York State
Regional Conference of the NSA
was held at the University of Roch-
ester. Since State College is not a
member, the delegates were observ-
ers and therefore enjoyed all privi-
leges, except the right to vote.
Time For A Change?

As a result of this conference. it
is ottr opinion that State College is
behind the times as far as nomin-
ation and election systems are con-
cerned. While we struggle with pa-
per ballots, Myskania stamps. and
line in assembly, other schools are
using election machines. Compul-
sory assemblies, nominations and
elections were recommended for
schools of 500, not 2.000. Many of
the schools have Student Senates
which make all nominations, and
are voted upon by student associa-

tions—absentee at school and in the
student unions. Nominations can be
made through petitions of 25, 50,
or 100 students, depending on the
office, self—nomination and political
sponsorship.

Who’s Running?

Nominating assemblies are dated
—B.C. Campaigning was also dis-
cussed at this Sub-Committee on
Nominations and Elections. Once
again. State College brought up the
rear. How can we expect anyone to
be interested in elections when they
don't even know who’s running! It
would be nice to see Page. Draper,
Hawley, Husted and Richardson
plastered with posters during an
election. Perhaps more people would
take time to mark down a few
numbers on that little white bal-
lot. To mention one favorable point
~pcople liked the preferential sys-
tem of voting.

’I‘ricd. Found Wanting

In the Structure of Government
Committee, types of representation
were discussed. It was interesting
to note that our Student Council is
larger than most Student Con-
gresses. Student Congress, that is,
representative government from
fraternities. dorms, at large, is the
order of the day on campuses large
and small. This system opens more
channels of information and makes
for a more informative student
body. Student Association and com-
pulsory assemblies have all been
tried and found wanting. Responsi-
bility of officers to the student
body and the operation of coin-
miitces in government were dis-
cussed.

As we. were sent to observe and
suggest to Council the advisability
of joining NSA, we feel that al-
though the value of this group is
great, more information should be
gathered and the President of NSA
be invited to our Student Council
to explain the inner workings of
NSA on a national and interna-
tional basis before we seriously con—
sider joining the group.

And The Open Mind iooketh back
upon the year past, and 10, he re-
Joiceth. and speaketh unto them,
the multitudes, saying, “It is good."
For the year that was began when
fell the first leaf, hath been of
trying nature. The children of
State hath crossed their desert.

Yea, readeth ye now the last
scribes of the twelvemonth and
know ye what hath been done thus
far in the Kingdom of State.

That foul and cursed word spoken
as “apathy” hath taken heel and
vanished from the mouths of our
brethren. As never before hath a
swarm of activity droned within the
noble walls of ottr institute. The
body of ministers hath ruled well
their people, and the multitudes in
turn hath tilled their land with
sinews strong and fervent.

Right well hath performed our
warriors. clad in the purple robes
and yellow garment of our land.
and well proud may shine the coun-
tenance of our people when walketh
they on foreign fields.

Celebrate ye merrily the birth of
Christ, and have joy when cometh
the night of the new year! Drink
ye the red wine of contentment, for
Us ye that have given unto thy-
self a good and prosperous year.

The Penguin, as you read last
week, will appear soon after the
holiday providing SA passes the
budget. The magazine is neither-
a humor magazine, a literary jour-
nal, or an oversized newspaper. It
is a mature, but light publication,
with a little bit of everything. It is
the last part of the three publica-
tions necessary on every campus.
It is one in which the faculty can
express themselves outside of their
official capacity; one in which crea-
tive material can appear more fre-
quently; one in which there is room
to develop in a complete manner
articles dealing with issues of cur-
rent and local interest.

Chronologically, the appearance
of The Penguin, will create a per-
fect balance~the newspaper appears
weekly, the literary magazine year-
iy, and now, the magazine, quar-
terly. Look for it on your local lower
Draper newsstand.
