It seems that the students are not
the only ones with that blank feel-
ing these days. From the Dolphian
comes this gem.

“I shall now illustrate what I
have on my mind," said the profes-
sor as he erased the blackboard.

From the Hilltop Press:

The best place to find a helping
hand is at the end of your arm.

The eternal coquette is a dame
with R.S.V.)P. in her eyes.

Indoor sports are all right if they
go home at a reasonable hour.

More remarkable roommates from
the Ithacan:

The Mouth-A-Plcnty who solves
all your important problems in a
few well chosen words of something
resembling advice; and always
knows what’s wrong with you and
the rest of the world and will be
overjoyed to spend a few hours tell-
ing you about it.

The Superior Clam who, because
he always has his nose in a book,
is too engrossed in education to
bother with incidentals as doing his
share of cleaning up the room or

eyes low in order to appear mysteri-
ous and all-knowing.

That’s about enough for now. One
more thing, Christmas is coming, it
says so in all the papers!

To the Editor:

I feel that it is my duty, as a
student of this college, to inform
you that laxity exists in the Mys-
kania organization.

On Monday, November 19, I was
given a warning by a well meaning
Sophomore. As yet, I have not re-
ceived a formal acknowledgment
which, as I understand, Myskania
is to issue.

As a strong supporter of State
College traditions. I feel that this
situation should be remedied im-
mediately. There is no excuse for
such delay in the deliverance of a
warning, especially with the effici-
ency which exists in the Student
Mail system. In all due respect I
urge the members of Myskania to
fulﬁll their duties and obligations.

On November 11 through the 13,
Cornell University acted as host to
the Annual Conference of the As-
sociation of College Unions. N.Y.S.-
CT., represented by a delegation of
Student Union Board members in-
cluding myself, was one of the
thirty-ﬁve colleges and universities
attending the Conference.

All of the delegates at the Con-
ference participated in three dis-
cussion groups. During these group
meetings we discussed the following
topics:

1. The Position of the Union on
Campus, in which We talked about
what the relationship of the Union
program and that of social organi-
zations on campus should be. It
was felt that the Union should act
as the co-ordinator of Union ac-
tivities, supplement and complement
the social program on campus.

2. A More Successful Union Pro-
gram. In this discussion the dele-
gates explained various Union pro-

 

paylng his share of the bills, and Ronconi, Sophomores, and Miss C. William Thiesen, An Upholder grams that were presented by small
who carries his nose high and his Darzano. of State College Traditions. colleges and large universities.

Many ideas for new Union activities
and methods of publicity were dis-
cussed. The success of an activity
should be measured by how much
those attending enjoyed the activity.

3. How to Stimulate Creative
Thinking Among Union Members.
Topics discussed in this session were
how to make use of recommenda-
tions of previous functions to stim-
ulate new ideas and how to utilize
an old idea, make changes and
bring about new programs.

A major highlight at the Confer-
ence was an address given by Dean
Charles C. Noble of Syracuse Uni-
versity. Everyone agreed that his
talk on Student leadership was very
meaningful and inspirational. He
left us with four “C‘s” needed for

good leadership. 1. Concern for
people; 2. Conviction which but-
tresses the concern; 3. Commit-

ment; 4. Courage to face the chal-
lenge of change. This involves
ﬂexibility.

To sum up, the Conference proved
to be very worthwhile to all those
attending. Each person took away
many ideas which were discussed
formally in the discussion groups
and also informally during social
activities. The ideas the Albany
delegation received from the Con-
ference will help in improving our
service to the students of State
College.

Signum Laudis. . .

(Continued from Page 1, Column 3)
and who have completed 88 hours
of academic work; ’77 of these hours
must have been completed on
campus.

The member with the highest aca-
demic average becomes president. A
student secretary is elected in the
spring from those admitted to mem-
bership in the first group. At the
same time a faculty secretary, cur-
rently Mr. Arthur Collins. Assistant
Professor of English, is also elected.

In addition to student members,
Signum Laudis has a faculty mem-
bership of more than thirty-five per-
sons, admitted either as student
members during their undergradu—
ate years or elected to numbersth
since their appointment to the fac-
ulty. Since 1951 it has been custom-
ary to nominate for membership
those of the faculty who belong to
Phi Beta Kappa, since the purposes
and standards of the two organiza-
tions are comparable

During the. coming year Signum
Laudis will undertake a project to
establish cIOser relations between
the college and the honor societies
of high schools in the vicinity. A
committee consisting of Harry Cook—
er, Nancy Schneider and June
Friinkland plans to invite high
school honor students to attend va-
rious activities at the college. Mem-
bers of Signum Luudis will not as
guides to the visitors. This project
will, it is hoped, familiarize more of
the top students of the area with
the college and its liclivities.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. DECEMBER 14. 1956

 

,,,l%mMJl%whw,,,

By FRANK VELOSKY

Last year’s Yuletide hit recording
was little Bary Gordon’s M-G-M
platter “Nutln’ For Christmas.” As
for new hit Christmas discs this
year, it looks like there will be a
famine. No one new Christmas re-
cording has enough potential to be-
come a smash hit. Because of this
situation our main record enter-
tainment will come from the tradi-
tional pieces like “White Christ-
mas" and “Winter Wonderland." A
few new ones deserve some merit,
however.

New Christmas Singles

Bing Crosby’s platter of “May
God Bless You" is probably the
best new Yule disc of the year. The
lyric exhibits muoh quality in re-
lating the true Christmas spirit. The
words are enhanced by the cheer-
fully moving tune. The song may
not rate as well commercially as it
might have in previous years. but a
good push by the disc jockeys could
help it move somewhat.

“Toyland,” a fair hit for Nat
"King" Cole on Capitol last year.
has been re-released. It's an excel-
lent waxing and should gain a fair
share of popularity again this year.
New Christmas Albums

“Songs of Christmas" is the title
of a new album by the Norman
Luboff Choir released by Columbia.
This package contains some of the
lesser-known traditional carols as
well as some rather popular ones.
The beautiful interpretations of the
group are very admirable. This is
very relaxing and listenable ina-
terial.

Lawrence Welk brightens the
Christmas season with his new
Coral album “'Merry Christmas.“
This package contains traditional
carols and Christmas standards
done in Welk’s (inifamous chain-
pagnc-bubble type style. If you en-
joy listening to more than one Welk

Student Slates Ups And Downs Religious Clubs
Of Formal Held In Elevator

By ROBERT .HELWIG

Six hundred people enter the
lobby of the Ten Eyck Hotel. These
aren't ordinary people; these are
State College students who are an-
ticipating an evening of fun and
frolic dancing to Elliot Lawrence.

We step into the elevator whose
capacity is 601 (that’s including the
elevator operator) and ascend to
the twelfth ﬂoor. The elevator stops

. all out. Only 600, that is (we’re
going to leave the elevator operator
behind.)

The Grand, Grand. Grand Ball-
room is just around the corner. We
are all breathing hard (because the
air conditioners aren't working).

There it is . . . The Grand. Grand,
. . . Grand Ballroom. This Grand
Ballroom accommodates only 200
people (uncomfortably).

Back to the elevator everybodyll
At least we can dance there. The
elevator may even play his pie-eyed
pipe for us.

Well. elevator dancing may be all
right for elevators but it has its
you-know~what for people.

We decide to try the main Ball-
room once more. As all 600 of us
(and there may be a few more by
this time) converge on this spacious
cul-de-sac (once you get in you
can't get out). The waitresses line
up all their glassware on the floor
directly in front of us. Needless to

say we break every last piece of
anchor hoching in our enthusiastic
attempt to crush ourselves on the
dance floor.

Since

there

(600 to be exact and we may have
picked up more by this time), we
decide that half of us will sit while
the other half dances. Just then
(simultaneously, in fact) Elliot
Lawrence announces that all tables
will be cleared from the ﬂoor. This
leaves 300 of us standing . . . and
300 of us standing.

Well we can always stand or we
can sit smack up against the wall
under the windows which have been
opened wide (because the air con-
ditioners still aren't functioning).

Waitresses? . . . We Were plagued
by her. Since there were no tables,
there were no waitresses to wait on
the tables. In fact, I think the
waitresses were waiting on the
waitresses.

We decide to leave as members
of the orchestra start “loosing their
lips" for taking a minimum of
“breaks”. En masse we push to—
ward the elevator through oceans
of ash trays, (none of which I saw
so I “flicked” my ashes on the
floor when I got the urge to "flick").

Once in the elevator we all stand
at arms length from each other
(all 602 of usr I say 602 because
we now have an operator who
operates the elevator operator

The happiest moment of the even-
ing is now at hand. We get our
coats back from the hatcheck
women.

As we bid farewell to the spacious
TenEyck we vow that we will al-
ways remeber this $4.00 per couple,

are so many of uswell planned FIASCOIII!
