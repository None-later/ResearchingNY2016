Varsity Keglers Bow To Sieno;
Sullivan Tops Team Averages

“Home, Sweet Home" was the cry
of the Fed Bowling squad this week
as they dropped a close match to the
Keglers who call the Loundonville
alleys home.

The Siena Indians had what it
took Tuesday as they played their
Albany foes right down to the wire
in each of their three intercollegiate
bolwing tilts.

In the opener, the Teachers found
themselves four fat pins shy of

Hmmsl Score
Cage Victories

Page Hall came alive at 9:30 pm.
Wednesday night as the Lakers and
E131? cage teams battled it out first
amongst themselves and later the
refs. The game ended with EEP
the victor, the tilt declared under
protest, and referees glad it was all
over.

In constructive efforts Pete Bar-
l‘agelato and Tom Brierly chalked
up 28 between them, Pete getting
16. For the Lakers, who trailed by
22-16 at the half, Paul Sloand and

Don Dame combined for one more
than half the team total, Paul hit»
ting for 12, Don for 8.

Prior to this battle Ed Demske
and Red Miller joined forces in
leading the Hmms! to a 42-30 con-
quest of VIPs. Big Ed found the
range for 16, while the redhead
tallied 12. O’Connor paced the los-
ing Teachers league team with 13.
The halftime score read, Hmms! 23,
VIPS 16.

The middle contest of the night
proved to be the biggest runaway
as APA suffered a resounding 74-44
setback to a power-packed Vet
team. Al Koula. stood out for the
older men, while Frank Blesi swish-
ed in 28 points in a losing effort.

tier led the attack with 184 and
received neat backing from O'Con-
nor with but two maples less. The
invading Capital city foes were
paced by Joe Ketchum's 180.
Sullivan Tops

Tom Sullvan, who as usual found
himself top man on the totem pole,
led the Purple and Gold in the mid-
dle fray with a conspicuous 169.
Nevertheless. the ﬁnal teams totals
stood at 794-773 with the statesmen
only hoping the last game would be
theirs.
Win Finale

Dave Oakleaf, the small soph with
the mighty left hand, had himself
a royal battle with his leadoff foe
as they went for high single honors
in the ﬁnale. Siena's O'Connor won

the campaign, but Dave JOllled with SL5

his teammates in winning the team
battle.

With the bowling balls packed
for next week and the captains
counting up the ﬁnal tallies it was
seen that O'Connors 523 stood out
for the night.

The crowd of sardines packed into
the tiny Milne gym will have more
room to breath tomorrow when the
Peds attempt to duplicate their 23-
13 victory of last Saturday. The
graplers play host to Fairleigh Dick-
inson College in a 3:30 match to be
held in Page gym, where a good-
sized crowd is anticipated.

Sharing in the laurels of last
week‘s conquest of visiting Brooklyn
Poly were ﬁve Ped grunters, one of
whom gained his victory without
stepping on the mat. This distinc-

Suilivon Leads
Veterans To IM
Bowling Sweep

Call it intramurals, call it inter-
collegiate!

Roll at Siena, roll at Rice‘s. To
Tom Sullivan, it‘s all the same when
it comes to bowling. The blonde
bowler opened the AMIA bowling
loop last week by displaying the
form that makes him top man for
the State Varsity Club keglers. As
the AMIA onwatchers gazed in
amazement, Tom rolled games of
198, 171, 200 for an opening wcek
total of 579.

Vets Gain 4

With this performance he and his
Vets ﬁve gained top spot on the
AMIA Pin Parade. The men of
Hilltop received the biggest jolt of
Tom's exhibition as they took the
four game loss.

Other cl‘an sweeps were gained
by APA, last year‘s champs. as they
dropped EEP to the cellar. Ridge
made sure the Pottermen had coin-
pany in the lowly spot as they sent
SLS to that same level.

APAches Triumph

The Apaches followed the lead of
their elders as they took three from
the Rouscrs, while the Gutterdusters
took an equal amount from the KB
keglcrs.

In individual honors, frosh Bill
Bouncy tried to steal the show from
veteran Sullivan as he knocked 561
pins from their perpendicular posi—
tions.

Dave ()uklcuf followed with 525,
while another oldtimer, Al Stephen-
son joined the leaders with 516.

also as he topped it by ten.

In teiim bowling tlic (iiittcrdiis-

Expecting to find their foes heading
for those big gutters, KB soon rcul-
ized the straight path and control
possessed by the Dusters. Relying
on ll big clinic of 814, the contingent
found themselves accumulating a

tion went to Tom Farrell who gain—
ed a forfeit win in the 123 pound
class to put the Purple out in front
before Wayne Harvey gained a close
decision for another three points to
raise the Purple lead to eight.
Mackie Loses To Heat

The heat in the study gym was
the downfall of Bill Mackie as he
was forced to forfeit a big lead when
he was unable to come out for the
third and ﬁnal period. Mackie was
leading in the official score by a
decisive margin at the time of his
demise.

Any fan who blew his nose hard
missed the next bout as Charlie
Kane wasted no time in dLsposing
of his opponent in 36 seconds for
one of the fastest pins on record.
Following his example, Ozzie Leahy
employed a half nelson to subdue
his advisary at the 2:39 mark of the
second period. The 157 pound cap-
tain was working on a slim lead at
the time of his triumph.

State's 167 pounder, Dave Gold-
berg, didn't fare so well as the
senior grappler was off form and
dropped a decision for three points.
It remained for Al Tuttle to sew up
the win for the Purple by overpow-
ering a Brooklyn inuseleman for the
five points needed to put the match
out of Brooklyn's reach.

An important win it was, for it
took only two minutes to give the
Peds a taste of their own medicine
when John Gremmcr found himself
on the receiving end of a two min-
ute pin in the afternoon's lllllll
match.
