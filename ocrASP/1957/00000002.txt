To have government revision or not. To have politi-
cal parties or not. These are the questions, and the answers
lie right there in your hands, Juniors, Sophomores and
freshmen. Tuesday at 10 am. a joint meeting will be held
in Page Hall Auditorium for all the members of the classes,
of ’58, ’59, and ’60. Revisions in State College government
emphasizing the possible creation of political parties on
campus, will be discussed openly. Here is your opportunity
to indicate to your class representatives to Student Coun-
cil just how you feel about this issue. It is your obligation
as a member of Student Association to attend this meeting
and to express your views. You are the one that this mat-
ter will affect. It is from you that Student Council, which
is responsible for initiating any innovations in govern-
mental procedures, must acquire the basis for its decision.
You are the primary source from which Council must
draw its definite conclusions—your suggestions, ideas, and
opinions are of outstanding value to this branch of our
legislative body.

As for revision itself—~do we need it? Take a look
around at the next legislative Convocation meeting, count
the number of resignations from class and government
offices, and evaluate the capabilities of those individuals
that run for an office. It is only between the clicking of
knitting needles, the scratching of pens, and the rattling of
newspapers that a motion is ever voted on by the student
body assembled in Convocation. The seats are filled, yes,
but only by a blank face populace that seldom realizes what
issue is at stake when it raises its hand. Now, what is your
answer?

How About It? . . .

Last week, while most of us were enjoying a short
break from college studies, Governor Harriman sent his
annual budget to the State Legislature for approval. The
largest appropriation in the budget is approximately 597
millions of dollars for the expansion and improvement of
education in the Empire State, and of more vital interest
to us, of the State University.

Construction money for a new library and planning
money for the desperately needed and long-overdue gym-
nasium here at State are included in the appropriation.
But, let's not jump to the conclusion that the fate
of these projects rests only on the action of the State Street
legislators, for the student body of this college, as well as
those of the other branches of SUNY, can do their part
in securing sorely needed facilities. Most of the money in
the Governor’s budget slated for State University expan-
sion is included in a 250 million dollar bond issue to be
placed before the voters in the November election. At pres-
ent, the passage of the bond issue is somewhat in doubt.
We can do our part in removing that doubt!

At present, one of the committees out of Student
Council is the Inter-Collegiate Association, an association
of ten of the eleven State Teachers Colleges. Student
Council could recommend to the local ICA committee that
they promote, along with the other member schools. a
campaign to place the bond issue and the necessity 01' its
passage before the eyes 01' the voter. A campaign of this
type might consist of letters home to parents and friends.
and to the letter column of hometown newspapers. ICA is
the most logical group to conduct such a campaign, since
it is the only existing link among the student bodies of
the Teachers Colleges.

We urge the members of Student Council and ICA to
give consideration to this proposal. The other schools lack
facilities as much as State. We want the gymnasium; we
want the library. Do we want to see what we can do in
assuring the passage of the bond issue?

To the‘Edltor:

Our student government, formu-
lated as Student Association, is
making progress: apathy has been
replaced by jeering. In a few more
years, critical evaluation might fol-
low, at this rate. But—~do we have
to wait?

Many groups, as they grow larger,
substituted representative democ-
racy for town meeting; state now
has a population of 2000. Let's
think about it. Is Student Council,
increased by ten thTs year, doing its
best? To the possible surprise of
Thursday morning quarterbacks, it
is doing a good job. But is it pos-
sible that if there were more com-
petition for seats, it would be better?
Let's think about it. Is Myskaiila
a popularity contest? Or is it (or
could it be) a body to uphold and
exemplify the best in our school
and a means of recognizing the
truly outstanding? Let’s think about
it.

The conclusion mine)? Reduce
SC to ten, refer legislation back to
classes instead of at SA legislative
convocations, keep Myskania but
change our attitude toward it. In
other words, subordinate personal-
ities to values in elections, and stop
doing and judging everything in
terms of “pushing for Myskania."
And it might be logical to turn all
elections and voting over to Elec-
t.o.i Commission,

Finally: government isn't just an
activity! Offices should be filled
according to interest and capabil-
it,'. But, as to the extent that the
government affects us. we have the
right and the responsibility to form,
maintain, and cooperate with it.
Let‘s think about it, let's talk
about it, let's do something!

Have you been noticing the Lucky Strike Sticklers? How about this
one?—The deﬁnition of silent period—“crushing-rushing."

To all third quarter Milne Student Teachers—“Good afternoon Ladies

The attendance for the expected appearance of Governor Harriman
at convocation was not so good: let's see how the Lord does today!
We like the subtle advertising for the “Rat Morte"—notice those
beards.

Cafeteria Chatter:

UN DERESTIMA’I‘ED EFFORT

We were glad to see the fine tryouts for "Plain and Fancy" even

is something worthwhile to get results. We're looking forward to the

What fools are we who try to say

The things we should in a truthful way.

We've both rushed in where angels fear

To have our views, each week, appear.

We're certain that whatever we write

Is bound to cause a little ﬁght

But think twice before you disagree .
And say to yourself “Who are we?"

If all opinions emerged the same

No one would have no one to blame.

We'll try our best to be aware

And write our comments with utmost care.
You. our readers, may be ﬁne debators

But we are only the “Common-Staters."

By ART PLOTNIK

As the new semester starts. many
of us find ourselves in the same old
rut. In fact the very act of finding
ourselves in the same old rut is a
rutted gesture in itself. Thank
goodness I'm in no rut. I'm in no
rut. I'm in no rut. I'm in no rut.

Speaking of ruts, I am overjoyed
to see that several students have
ceased to bathe in the sticky slime
of that most despicable of all pat-
terns—shaving. Several weeks ago
I condemned female math-majors
for not brandishing the duridiuin
blade. However, if one speaks of the
sensuous delicacy of a female leg
and the rugged countenance of a
man's chin in the same breath . , .
wll, teach him the difference. The
knowledge might be useful some
time.

Beards are practical. Boards are
functional. Beards are sublime.
Beards are masculine. They are col-
orful, individual, sensational. and
adaptable. They tickle and they
itch. Buy one today!

1:

We also noticed that there were
many new transfers starting the
semester. Well someone should say
it. and as a good citizen, I'll say it:
We don't like no new transfers! All
you uppity aliens come a' snoopin'
around State College, a‘thinkin' to
mess up our happy little home. Go
home Martians! America for Amer—
icans! We folks are good upstand-
ing people, and you transfers come
around with all them crazy new
ideas and it just ain't right!

Shocks, I even suspect that some
of them there transfers are corri-
munists; you know, them big giant
monsters that eat up little kids——
even when they ain't hungry. Seems

like just any old coot can get into
this here place nowadays. I suggest
we kick every single dirty little
undesirable clean outta this here
school. It would be about an empty
building.

colleges. This association differs
from Inter-Collegiate Association in
that it would also include the two-
year colleges. Student Council un-
animously agreed to Mr. Payne’s
attendance.

A motion was made and unanim-
ously passed not to have an ex-
change program this year. A mo-
tion was made and tabled until next

of Moving-Up Day because of Easter
vacation coming so late this year

pointed to the Constitutional Review
