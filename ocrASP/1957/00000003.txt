Bids

Formal bids will be sent to the

ceive a bid from her ﬁrst prefer—
ence but does receive one from her
second. she will be obligated to join
the second sorority. If she does
not receive one from her second
or ﬁrst choice, but does from her
third, then she will be obligated to
join the third.

Any rushee who refuses to accept
pledgeship in a sorority which she
has stated in her preference blank
shall be ineligible for general sorori-
ty rushing and bidding for one year
from the date of refusal.

As they swing into the ﬁnal half of the season. the
varsity basketball squad will be as busy as a bunch of
beavers; playing eight games during the current month
and three in the first week of March. Of these eleven, six
will be played in the lower “cubby hole” of Page, our home
gymnasium. In the ﬁrst half of the season, Coach Sauers’
charges took all ﬁve home games, the closest contest being

the one with New Haven. . . .

Speaking of our home gym,

it was called to the attention of ye scribe that a small sec-
tion of the Western Avenu end of the ﬂoor is beginning
to buckle. If this continue, it’s going to be fun watching
the players go over mounds in the floor to score points.
Minon Listed On NAIA Report

State's statistical averages are now included in the
National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, which
publishes small college statistical ratings weekly. Last
week, Jack Minon was listed sixteenth in foul shooting
percentages with a total of 23 out of 27 free throws made,
or an average of 85.2. The weekly report includes leaders
throughout the country in points per game, ﬁeld goal and
foul shooting percentages for individuals and teams, aver-
age rebounds per game for individuals and teams, leading
offensive and defensive teams and a list of undefeated

teams.

This semester’s team of Peds will include Don Beardon

(6’1") from Watertown. Don

is a left handed shooter who

has just completed his term with Uncle Sam’s Air Force
Polio Fund To Beneﬁt From Tonight’s Game

A collection will be taken up for the March of Dimes
at tonight’s game with New Paltz. This gesture is being

run in accordance with the

Albany Sports Infantile Pa-

ralysis Fund to help “the Kid Around the Corner.”
We ﬁgured it is about time we began pushing the

forthcoming Siena game to

be held at the Washington

Armory on February 23. When this game comes up, we’d
like you to keep one thing in mind. The State-Siena series

started back when many of

us were thinking about our

two o‘clock feeding instead of college, in 1938. Only ﬁve
games have been played between the schools since that
time, and Siena has won all of them.

Maintain Lead

 In [M Keg/ing

The intramural keglers got back
to clearing the pins off the Rice
alleys yesterday after taking a
couple of weeks off to clear the
library reserve shelves. Thanks to
a beautifully working handicap sys—
tem all but one team found itself
able to gain the top slot within a
week or two in a league that's as
wide open as the old west.

As of Wednesday, the Gutterdust-
ers were able to hang onto a slender
one game lead. Ridge, meanwhile,
found itself running ahead of a
three team pack of the Vets, SLS
and APA by the same small margin.

Vets High !

In high gilll‘le laurels thus far the
power-packed team of Sullivan and
Company ~- sometimes called the
Vets~ stand second to no one. Be-
sides possessing a high 886 individ-
ual game effort our gallant ex—
defcnders lead the 10 team loop
with a 765.4 game average.

Not to be outdone the Guttei'dust—
ers hang onto a 2410 high team
triple besides looking up to no one
in loop standings.

Tom Tops

After relinquishing his top slot
to newcomer Don Dame for a period
of exactly seven days Tom Sullivan
again fears no kegler encroaching
on his 178.8 average. Just for kicks.
Tom adds to this the high 579 triple
for individual bowlers. Decker Par-
dec meanwhile is still able to boast
about ii top 232 tally.

mastering of a mediocre Hillyer College Connecticut squad.

Tonight, the Feds play

to be played in the short period of a week as they

tertain New Paltz State in

their second of four games
en-
the Page “ﬁeldhouse.” The

preliminary will get under way at 6:45 pm. All proceeds
from tonight’s game will be turned over to the Albany
Infantile Paralysis Sports Fund. The varsity cheerlead-
ers will collect a donation preceding the feature contest.

WAA Starts
Clothing Drive

In accordance with the present in-
ternational assistance being given
to the Hungarian freedom-ﬁghting
refugees, Woman’s Athletic Associa—
tion will sponsor a clothing drive
next week to aid in the efforts to
make the lives of the Hungarians
worth a better living here in
America. Clothing will be collected
in all group houses and boxes will
be placed in the college building
peristyles for commuters and off-
campus residents.

Phi Delt Tops Bowling Loop

Even though they split games
with the Gamma Kappa Phi team
this week, the Phi Delta sorority
keglcrs remained on top of the
WAA loop with a 7—1 record. They
are closely followed by Psi Gain
sorority which split with Kappa
Delta this week. WAA bowling
takes place on Wednesday after-
noons at the Rice Alleys.

Added to the list of women's ac-
tivities will be modern dance iii-
struction, scheduled to begin Thurs-
day afternoon in the Commons.

Due to the fact that the current
manager of varsity basketball will
be off campus teaching for the next
eight weeks. one or twu undergrads
are needed to fill the position. Any-

Tomorrow night, the statesmen
will be right back in Page to play
host to Brooklyn Poly. The varsity
attraction will follow the State JV-
Siena JV contest which will com-
mence at the regular 6:45 starting
time. Poly brings two outstanding
players into Page in the persons of
“Whitey” Heie and Johnny Juan.

On Tuesday night the JV and
Varsity will meet the junior and
senior divisions of Hartwick Col-
lege. Hartwick has a strong team
and its record shows a victory over
Siena.

llolwuy, Anderson Pace Attack

State took its tenth win in twelve
starts on Tuesday from a dismal
Hillyer ﬁve which went down to its
tenth defeat in eleven games. The
Pods led from the outset as Joe
Anderson hit on two jump shots to
open the scoring and put the Al-
banians in the lead, 4—0. Hillyer
didn’t connect from the floor until
two and a half minutes had elapsed.
Foul shooting kept them in the
game throughout the early part
of the first half. However, with
Gary Holway and Anderson leading
the scoring, the Feds took a 47—32
halftime edge.

Hawks Cut Lead

Behind Frank Deutsch and Roger
Lynch, the Hawks began to cut the
State lead in the early part. of the
second half. The closest they got,
however, was 51-43. From there, the
Feds returned to form and after
ten minutes led, 69-51.

Dick Causcy ably assisted the
scoring in the second half spurt as
he garnished nine assists for the
night's activities. Coach Sauers
pulled his starters in the late min-
utes of the half, and the bench
strength took over where the start-
crs left off us they added four more
points onto the ten minute lead to
go away winning, 93-72.

300 (.‘irclc Due

The Hillyer live hit on 20 out of
28 foul shots to the Feds 15 for 21,
but Albany scored 39 times from the
Ilool‘ to Hllyci"s 26 to account for
lh!‘ decision.
