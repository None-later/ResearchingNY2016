STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 8. 1957

Saud Visits United States;
Greeted By Chief Executive

By FRANK SWISKEY

A million square miles of drifting
sand, a desolate wasteland. This is
Saudi Arabia on the surface and yet
below this scene of utter desolation
are the pools of oil, the liquid that
makes this feudal kingdom all pow-
erful in the Middle East. It is the
piece of territory in the world be-
longing lock, stock and oil barrel
to one man, Ibn Saud.

Blood And Sand

This barren land since the time of
Mohammed has been the scene of
bloodshed. Early in the twentieth
century there appeared in this end-
less wasteland a militant follower
of the beliefs of Mohammed and
the Koran. Abdul Saud leading his
followers with the cry “Back to the
Koran and on to the Land," set
out to unify Arabia. He drove out
the Turks, the ruling family of He-
jaz, and smashed British plans to
divide the country. When Abdul
died in 1953 he controlied all of this
mysterious peninsula except Yemen.
The man of the black tent had
unified his country through the
only two methods known to him:
physical violence, and bribery.

The Weapon

The 1938 oil was discovered,
overnight the Saudi family held the
scepter of power and wealth in the
middle east. The land belonged to
them hence all royalties from it. Oil
pays for the Cadillacs. palaces, even
the air conditioned Riyadh Rai road
that runs nowhere. The “Black
Gold" of the world has such im-
portance that American oil com-
panies such as Aramaco must follow
such rules as no alcohol and no
Christian worship on their installa-
tions. The United States govern-
ment must also train and equip the
Saudi Army and mobilize new on
reserves if it wants to keep the
raluable oil concessions and the

strategic Dahran airbase. This is
the price the United States must
pay to keep its eagles flying.

The Man

In 1953 Abdul Saud, the old king
of Arabia died; into his place step-
ped Ibn Saud, the new king. Old or
new it made no difference, the Saud
family came first, the country sec—
ond. The country remained one of
mud huts, dates, camels, and pov-
erty. The wells pumped the liquid
gold but disease struck in the cities,
even in the holy cities of Mecca
and Medina. Disease that even
struck a little six-year-old boy, all
this would go unnoticed in this
land of sword and immorality had
not the little boy been the son of
Ibn Saud, oil baron. Saud was in-
vited to visit the United States and
with him came the little boy for
treatment. The tall man in the flow-
ing robes, blind in one eye, was per-
sonally greeted by President Eisen—
bower, an honor afforded no one
else on this globe. Ibn Saud pos-
sesses the oil and we the knowledge
to utilize it. There are no blind
sheep in this game of international
politics.

The Incident

In this world there are many peo-
ple, some intelligent, some other-
wise. One such person almost
wrecked American foreign policy by
trying to act as a crusader. How-
ever, the federal administration
stepped in and saved the day by tak—
ing over the duties of the self-
styled Savarnrola. President Eisen-
hower summed it up aptly when he
said, “We do not talk just with
those we like but with those we dis-
like if we are to achieve our goals."
King Saud may not be running a
model utopia in Saudi Arabia but
for the time being we must be part-
ners with him till death do us part.

Album Reviews

Ella Fitzgerald, generally accred-
ited as being the first lady of jazz,
certainly lives up to this standard
in her new two disc LP package on
Verve entitled “Ella Fitzgerald Sings
the Rogers and Heart Song Book.”
Thirty-four numbers are treated
here as they've never been done be—
fore. Miss Fitzgerald sounds re-
freshing on each number; there are
never any tired tones to be heard
as one might expect from a lesser
artist. It's hard to honestly report
which rendition is the best because
each is first rate.
Doris Day

“Day by Day" is the name of a
song. It is also the title given to a
new album release by Doris Day
on Columbia. Selections from this
LP will be featured on D. J. pro-
grams for a long time to come. 
Day's intimate styling of the twelve
standards she offers here has never
been excelled. This package will
make Day fans go wild and music
lovers in general marvel at her fine
vocalizlng.
Frank Sinatra

Frank Sinatra once again proves
why he is the disc jockey's favorite
male vocalist, in his new album re-
lease for Capitol. It's called “Close
to You." Sinatra interprets a dozen
ballads here in his own unmatch-
able phrasings. Besides the title
song, “PS. I Love You" and “Blame
It On My Youth" are among the
tunes included. To enhance Sin-
atra's “class” vocalizing, the Holly-
wood String Quartet has been em-
ployed to supply the backing.
Tony Bennet

"Tony," at new album by Tony
Bonnet on Columbia, should soon
be one of the top selling albums in
the country. Ballads are tastefully
inter-mixed with some very good
up tempo numbers to produce a very
listenable package. This is Bennet's
first dozen deal for Columbia in a
long while and should satisfy his
long list of fans who have eagerly
awaited it.
