Shackles . . .

This has been a busy week for the few
active people in this school.
Greeks have been meeting in their secret
hideaways cutting lists. In another hide-
away, known to the chosen few as Page
Prison, the captives were plotting a means

of escape.

All of these captives had been sent up for
an eight-week stretch. Because they were
born unlucky, some have been re-sentenced.
Others, the incorrigible souls,
punishment—the loss of the Pedagogue or
a one dollar ﬁne. They thought they had
committed the perfect crime, but each of
them found a mimeographed summons in
Student Mail. After every offense, they re-
ported to the parole ofﬁcers in the corner of
the spankingly-clean Commons. Some of
their alibis worked, and these fortunates
joined their comrades in the outside world
of the cafeteria. Those who weren‘t clever
enough were shipped back to Page for the
Friday morning Vocational Class in stu-

dent government.

The prisoners, completely snowed by the
dull dissertations, slouched in their seats

and read the Prison Weekly.

lessly stretched their weary arms, the
“thirteen” jumped up and recorded the

stretch as a vote.

This past Tuesday, a handful of the cap—
tives met and discussed their plight. Dis.
cussion was lively and interesting. Unfor-
tunately, time ran out. Plans were made
for another non-compulsory meeting.

These progressive prisoners must remem-
ber one thing. They, themselves, must in-
itiate the plan of escape, as their captors
refuse to take any action. They must or—
ganize and prepare a suitable alternative to
replace the ineffective “Friday at 10“ classes

before they can be free.

All week,

Next week, sororities and fraternities end
their yearly quest for new members. Rush-

“dirty rushing” has been dying a slow death
at State for some time. For this we must

To the freshman who must decide very
soon whether or not to pledge a Greek so-
ciety, we can only reiterate what past ed-
itors of this paper have said—be sure. Since
November you have been exposed to soror-
ity and fraternity life on this campus.
Weigh the pros and cons carefully before
you sign on the dotted line. Be sure the
group wants you, and of more importance,
be sure you want the group. A member of a
sorority or fraternity only enjoys member—
ship and gains satisfaction when he or she
takes an active interest in the group. So,
don‘t be persuaded by glittering rush party
decorations, and collegiate-looking jackets.
Rather, look at the people who made the
decorations. and who are wearing the jack-

ets—then decide.

As they rest-

Remember also, that to assume the role
of an independent is no crime. But. to join
a Greek organization because your room-
mate is joining would be both an injustice

In this article I will try to express
my feelings as to what is wrong
with our student government. In
expressing these problems I feel it
right that I should express some
means of correcting these wrongs as
I see them. Much of this is familiar
to many of you, and may not seem
to be very new or original. How—
ever, it is those who do not know
some of these problems that I hope
to reach.

As I have said, I feel that there
are many problems with our stu-
dent government. and in my three
years of student government work.
there have been chafing proposcd
to alleviate and correct these prob-
letns. Some of the proposed changcs
have been accepted. many have just,
been cast aside.

The first and perhaps thc great-
est problem is to find some type of
government to replace the weekly
convocations (01' as some prefer to
call them. “the Friday mortiing
reading hour». It is ridiculous to
compel people to go to lcgislativc
coiivocations when there is little
there to appeal to them. Many have
little interest in the affairs of stu-
dent government, anti the fact that
we compel these students to go to
the coiivocatioiis will not incrcasc
their interest in our systcm. I am
not saying that all studcnts do not
care about student gchriimcnt, but

By JOHN STEFANO
to a great extent many have less
time and interest for student gov-
eriiinent. than those who are active
in it.

In order to make our student
government function properly.
think that a rcpresr-ntalivc type of
government should be set up in
place of the present system. In this
way. a much smaller group of in-
terested students could handle the
details of government work.

The body could consist of from
thirty to forty men‘ibcrs. There are
many ways of setting up this body
as to where the members would

for examplei. This group would take
over the functions of the convoca—
tions as they now exist. It would
also assume some of the work of
Student Council. Council would

I would like to go into the prob-
lems which I feel have bogged down
the effectiveness of Student Coun-

three ycars the discussions in Coun-

is not because of poorer member-

up some of these duties to the rep-

71w Open Mind

 

By ART PLOTNIK

The infamous Albany urchins, so
prominent at State College last
year, seem to have diminished con-
siderably in number (and size). It
may be the cold weather. It may
be the Republican administration.
It may be apathy on the part of
Albany husbands.

However, sitting in the Richard-
son Dungeon recently, I noticcd an
immense Davy Crockett hat toddle
into the room and across the floor.
I picked up the hat, and sure
enough, underneath appearcd one
individual serving or urchin.

Naturally I stepped on it before
it had an opportunity to multiply.
Urchin, Urchin. on the floor,
Would you be large were you not

poor?
How can social workers heed you
Without a microscope to see you?
Eat better food! No, you "don‘t
wan'na,”
You‘d rather live on marijuana.
Shall I throw you through the door
Or spread your head around the
f'loor‘.J
Before your vacant skull I crunch,
May I pit-asc bum a week for lunch?

That was an unjust verse and I

things that escape the mind of the
wicked from time to time. Actually
I was an impoverished urchin once
until I started seLling fake Mys-
kania keys, A.M.I.A. equipment I
had stolen, and Student Council se-
crets. I never really escaped pov-
erty until I began to sing calypso
songs in the Commons for pennies
and cigarettes.

In this institution we learn how
to help urchins. We also learn how
to help hOods. Also vagrants, We

we starve to death?

Realizing the rising tension that
is being caused by the forthcoming
State—Siena contest to be played at
the Washington Avenue Armory on
February 23rd. the Albany State
Varsity Club announces that mem-
bers of Varsity Club will set up a
desk in lower Draper on Monday
afternoon for the purpose of selling
advance tickets to the game.
Regular Admission One Dollar

There will be two prices on the
tickets. Regular admission seats will
be selling for one dollar while re-
served section seats will be fifty
cents- extra, Varsity Club will sell
tickets all next week. However,
lllL‘l'C will only be a limited supply
on sale.

This is the fifth time State will

Council Discusses Budget;
Shows Appropriation Cut

By NANCY

At this week's meeting, Student
Council discussed at length their
proposed budget for the coming
year. This budget will include ap-
propriations amounting to quite a
bit less than this year's total of
$1.738. Such a change was brought
about by omitting from the budget
allowances for Student Council keys
which are .in unnecessary added ex-
pense. The ineffectiveness of Inter-
Collegiate Association deemed it
necessary to withdraw its financial
support also. There 5001115 to be til-
mosi coinplctc lack of interest in
ICA shown by most: connected with
it. Council's budget will no longer
support an Activities Week. but will
transfer this responsibility to Stu—
dent Union Board in the future.
College Exchange atid All-State
Night have also been excluded from
the proposed budget. Council also

agreed to allot $500. which, when
added to the same amount givcn

l-y the faculty, will send a Hungari-
.iii iefugee through our college. The
budget will be brought up before
Student Association for approval.

The number of members on Ath-
lctic Advisory Board has been
changed from 2 Seniors, 1 Junior,

It was found to be impossible to
