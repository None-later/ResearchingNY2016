STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 15. 1957

 

sports/.2 a. state

By JAN CHAMPAGNE

Have you ever madly wished that
you could say Helen Hayes, Kath—
erine Cornell or Mary Martin had
graduated from State? You can't.
They didn‘t. Nasty break. You
would be surprised at the fame of
some of our graduates. though. Take
for example a man who. in the last
two years. has directed all three of
the above leading ladies.

Vincent Donehue was born in
Albany where he attended Chris-
tian Brothers’ Academy. He was
very young when he graduated and
began college immediately at
State. He promptly walked into
Miss Futterer‘s office and, said. “I
would like to get into dramatics
at once." You can well imagine Miss
Futterer's raised eyebrow at this
young man's demand. but somehow
he succeeded. He enrolled in Ele-
mentary Dramatics and did quite a
bit. of acting. (At the time, eighteen
to twenty Tuesday night plays were
being done per yearli He then took
playwriting and Advanced Draina-
tics from Miss Futtcrer. and chose
a student's play for his direction.
Although the entire class was ex—
traordinary. his work was outstand-
ing.

College Career

Vince never seemed to get the
parts he wanted. In his Senior year,
"Berkeley Square" was produced
and he tried out for the part of
Standish but played the brother.
He laughs to this day about his
disappointments!

During his four years here. Miss
Helen Faye was in charge of the
college bookstore. She had become
acquainted with Katherine Cornell.
and was very interested in the the-
atre here. Through her. Vince was
introduced to Miss Cornell. who was
to be a great help to him in his
career. I

After his graduation in 1936. Miss
Futtcrcr arranged for Iiiiii to work
in the Plymouth Festival Summer
Thczitrc. and the following fall he
go: it job in Orson Welles‘ produc-
tion of "Julius Caesar." In reading
the play. China, the poet. has an
inconscquciitiiil part. but in Welles
t‘l'oflllt‘lltm it was ii lllit' vehicle
for an actor. He took the port. on
thc road. and was quite successful.
Ilc hiid ll few small parts on Broad-
wiiy. but most of his work at this
tiiiic was in radio. For ii few years.
he and :1 friend ran a theatre
school in Washington then
came the rise of television. and 
Donchue [us I must refer to him
from here oni returned to New
York

He has

There itl‘i' probably many reforms
which could be niiidc to improve

productions of "Peter Pan" with
Mary Martin, “Skin of Our Teeth"
with Helen Hayes and Mary Martin
and. what he considers his highest
moment. Katherine Cornell in “Bar-
retts of Wimpole Street.” This year
he was offered a contract to direct
four or five plays a year on “Play-
house 90" from Hollywood. and is
i-ow back in New York.

One of his greatest assets in the
theatre is his aptitude for making
and keeping friends. His character—
istic loyalty to his friends and to
State College is shown in his steady
correspondence and his willingness
to help young people. He has never
let an opportunity go by to help a
State College student. or graduate.
Two years ago. when Miss Futtercr
gave up teaching drama, her past
students gave her a farewell party.
Mr. Donehue flew in from Michi-
gan and back that night as a ges-
ture of his affection and apprecia-
tion.

Naval College
Offers Annual

Practice Cruise

For the first time Maritime
College is inviting college stu-
dents from other schools to send
one male student on its annual
Practice Cruise. The only schools
allowed to participate are those in
the State University, including the
teachers' colleges, Harpur College.
and the College of Forestry. The
cruise will probably take place from
June 17 to August 27. The ship. The
Empire State, will visit ports in
the western Mediterranean and
northern Europe.

All male students who will have
completed their Sophomore or Jun-
ior years by June. 1957. and who
have never been on probation are
eligible. Those interested are to write
an essay of not less than 750 words
on "Why I Am Interested in Mak-
ing this Trip." The essays will be
judged by a committee to be form-
ed by the President of the College.
One student will be picked to go.
Two alternates will also be chosen.

By NATALIE LEMOINE

From the Beaver Dam of Oregon . . .

State.

What is a College Boy? . . . In
between the sweetness of adoles-
cence and the sturdy worldliness
of manhood we find that specimen
of mankind known as the college
boy. . Be they tall. dark and
handsome. or short, fat and ugly.
they all have the same things in
common . . . a firm personal dedi-
cation to live it up. love it up. drink
it up and laugh it up.

College boys may be found any
time or any place . . . asleep in
class. conducting panty raids on
the girls' dorm, and trying earnest-
ly to prove they are God's gift to
women.

High school girls adore them. col-
lege girls tolerate them, house-
mothers dote on them, professors
can't stand the sight of them, and
parents send them to college to
get rid of them.

A college boy is a professional
juvenile delinquent with a crew cut
. . . a smoothie with a line as big
as his size 13 shoes . . . a walking
anthology of dirty drinking songs

a guy with the ambition of a
five-toed sloth, a stomach lined
with cast-iron, the grace of a bull
in a china shop, and the depend-
ability of Albany weather.

College boys like high school
girls. Dave Brubeck. Bull sessions,
Gina and Marilyn, and Saturday

night. . . They intensely dislike
formal parties. pop. tea, ROTC
drills. final week. uncooperative

girls, work, and the morning after.

No one can compare with them
when it comes to chugging beer or
picking up girls . . . no one flirts
and fools around in class as much
as they do . . . and no one screams
as loud that a miscarriage of jus-
tice has occurred. when they re-
ceive their semi-annual valentine
from the Registrar’s office.

Simply a seething mass of husky,
pipe smoking, loud talking, fast
acting. overgrown school boys.

But when you get back to campus
after a lousy beer-free weekend of
fighting your parents. brothers and
sisters. and ex’s, nothing could be
more welcome than those four ma-
gic words. “What cha doin’ Babe?!”
