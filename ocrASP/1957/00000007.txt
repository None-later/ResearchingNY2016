3,»: Spotlight

The Sport Spotlight shifts it’s
beam from the hoop loops to the
kegltng corners this week with
Decker Pardee being given the
recognition.

By roling a 513 high triple in the
IM kegiing leaue Decker staved off
an attempted sweep of his Ridge
teammates by a powerpacked Vet’s
squad. His high series included the
day’s second best single tally (211).

Runnerup for the week goes to
the old pro—Tom Sullivan who led
the varsity club keglers to a 3-1
win over ABC. His consistent efforts
of 180, 191 and 189 gave him a high
560 for the night.

The varsity bowling club's return
to active duty Tuesday after a long
examination holiday might well
have been labeled “The Battle of
the Anchormen” as ABC’s Burke
tried to match the efforts of State’s
Sullivan. It could not be denied
that Burke tried.

Despite his opening 210 single the
State keglers were right behind Sul-
livan’s 180 initial attempt and were
able to capture the ﬁrst of their
three points by a margin of 31 pins.

The ﬁnal tilt saw Sullivan finish
a rather consistent series with 189
and a 560 thirty-frame tally. Burke
was left in the dust with 521.

ABC In Finale

ABC was able to muster out a
third game victory thanks to a
combination of 167, 172, 173 and a
169 scores.

The remaining Peds deviated from

Kampf Komments:

Where There's A Will
There's A Way

Before the New Paltz game got under way last Friday
night, the manager of the Poughkeepsie area Peds in-
quired as to whether or not some ventilation could be
acquired. When he found out that it would be a trying task
to open the wide windows of Page, he must have told the
coach that the players would have to supply their own
drafts because the Paltzmen thereupon began to freeze
everything, including their own chances of making the
game a close contest.

The New Paltz freeze reminded this writer of the time
a West coast team froze the ball for ﬁfteen minutes. Their
opponents, taking advantage of the cold breeze, began to
read newspapers and magazines while the howls from the
stands mounted to a high pelican pitch. New Paltz came
close to causing the same type caliber of casualness. They
frosted the ball for thirteen and a half approximate min-
utes. while John Rookwood came over to the bench to talk
to Coach, Jack Minon struck up a conversation with one of
the New Paltz players who was sitting out the freeze, and
the rest of the Albany squad put their hands at their sides
and calmly awaited the finale of the chest passing drill
being given by Murphy and teammate.

When the New Paltz talented tossing twins decided
that things had congealed enough and Albany couldn't
possibly scorc over a hundred points, they put the ball back
into play and managed to score ﬁfteen points, along With
their teammates, for the remainder of the half. It all goes
to prove that if you can’t open the windows, the next best
way to cool things off is to have two players strike up some
cross ventilation by the chest passing method.

Advance Tickets for the 810113 Game

In an attempt to satisfy as many as possible, the var—
sitv Club will have a desk set up in lower Draper beginning
Mdnday afternoon for the purpose of selling advance tick-
ets for the Siena game to be played at the Washington
Avenue Armory a week from tomorrow. Tickets will sell
for the regular Armory prices: general admission, one
dollar: reserved section, $1.50. The Armory Will seat at
least 3,500, but with our current decisive win over Hart—
wick and Sicna‘s pair of defeats at the hands of the same
school. and the fact that scores are interested in this game,
we believe your best bet would be to visit the Varsity Club
advance ticket sale desk as soon as possible.

Supplementing 'l‘ransactions ‘ 4

Jack Minon sank two out of two free throws in the
Hartwick game to give him 28 for 33 for the yearthus in:
creasing his percentage to 84.8. . . . New Britain is one of
the leaders in the NAIA offensive team scoring percentage,
averaging around ninety points a game. . . . Coach'Saucrs
was quoted as saying the team Will be lucky to winhiour
of the last eight games of the season . . . “pessimist . _ .
“Who am I, Don? I was limited to eight points in the
Sicna—Williams game.“

Poly, 101-63, and Hartwick College,
88-75.

Paced by Gary Holway and Don
Bearden last Friday night, the Peds
ran up a big enough lead before the
New Paltz delegation decided to cool
the evenings activities with a deep
freeze which lasted almost fourteen
minutes in the second half. Holway
and Bearden had fourteen points
each in the congealed contest which
saw New Paltz score only ﬁfteen

markers in the second half.

The statesmen took advantage of
the rest given them by New Paltz
as they came back on Saturday
night to wallop Brooklyn Poly, 101-
63. It was the second time this year
that the Peds have entered the
hundred division. Poly was absent
the services of their number one
player, Whitey Hate. The Peds had
no mercy on the metropolitan squad
however, as all ten Sauersmen en-
tered the scoring column.

Ilartwick Becomes 13th Victim

Playing one of their toughest foes
of the year on Tuesday night, the
statesmen nipped Hartwick in a
tight skirmish, 88-75. For Albany
this was their fourth win in a row
and win number thirteen for the
scason. Hartwick now has an 11-4
record.

Joe Anderson and John Rookwood
gave State an opening 4-0 lead in
the game. but before five minutes
were up, Dutch Frederickson put
the Warriors in the lead, 5-4. State
regained the lead at. 14-13, but lost
it right back as Hugo hit for Hart—
wick.

A quick ten point jump gave the
Oneonta ﬁve a 25-14 lead. But as
Jack Minon began to ﬁnd the range
on set. shots from the outside, the
Peds bit into the Hartwick lead and
came out even at half-time. 40-40.

With Lambros and Lewis hitting
for the P'ae and White, State fell
behind by a 55-47 count midway
through the third period. The visi-
tor's lead was short lived, however,
as the Peds began to move in the
last quarter of the game. With
Holway, Mayer, Causey, Rookwood,
Minon, Anderson and Bearden all
playing outstandingly at intervals,
the Peds closed the gap at 61-61,
took a short lead, had it tied at
67-67, then broke the game wide
open. Don Mayer dropped two quick
lay-ups in , and with Mayer and
Holway controlling the boards and
Rookwood and Causey assisting and
driving in for tallys, the score soon
read, Albany 88, Hartwick 75.

Ranch Tavern of Albany walloped
the JV in the preliminary contest,

80-54.
