Far East Condemns Israel; aowwwgngn

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 13. 1957

Proposes Sanction Action

By JOHN YAGER

Israel Struggles For Life!

During the past week, the Middle
East crisis took the spotlight in the
news. In the United Nations, the
Afro-Asian bloc decided to present
a. resolution condemning Israel and
calling for the withholding of eco-
nomic and financial aid.

The United Nations had previ-
ously asked Israel to withdraw from
the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of
Aqaba. Israel refused to withdraw
unless the UN gave her a guarantee
that Egypt would not regain control
of this vital area. When Egypt had
banned Israel from using the Suez
Canal in 1949, the Israelis opened
a new trade route through the Gulf
of Aqaba. Egypt then seized the
strategic islands at the mouth of
the Aqaba and cut off Israel’s only
alternate trade route. Israel is now
afraid that Egypt will do the same
thing again which is why she is
asking for a guarantee before she
removes her troops.

Since Israel has refused to com-
ply with the UN request, several na-
tions have urged to sanction Israel.
If this decree were carried out. Is-
rael would become isolated.

Dag Hammarskjold has urged the
General Assembly not to sanction
Israel. Senators Bridges, Sparkman,
Kuchel, Knowland and Douglas
have all spoken out against the
sanction movement. However, the
Afro-Asian bloc is insistent. The
sanction resolution will not come
before the Security Council because
France will veto the measure. If
the resolution is to be passed, it
will have to be done in the General
Assembly.

Looking back over the actions
taken by the United Nations in the
past, we wonder why Israel was
picked out as "the nation to sanc-
tion,” when the United Nations had

ample justification for sanctioning
other nations earlier and did not.
We wonder why the UN didn’t
sanction Egypt when she disobeyed

a UN resolution calling upon her to .

cease banning Israeli shipping
through the Suez Canal. We wonder
why the UN didn’t sanction Soviet
Russia for its action in Hungary.
Should the slaughter of men, wo-
men, and children be taken lightly?
The UN took the time to approve
over ten resolutions on the Hun-
garian situation, yet Russia r‘isre-
garded everyone of them. We wona
der why the UN didn't sanction ln-
dia after she grabbed Kashmir.
Nehru Speaks of peace. It is too
bad that he doesn't practice what
he preaches. India wouldn’t even
allow a plebiscite. We wonder why!
Above all, We wonder why the UN
didn‘t sanction Red China who is
not even a member of the UN. Red
China's action in Korea, Burma.
Tibet, and Nepal left the door wide
open for a sanction movement. Yet
the UN sat idly by and instead of
hearing a sanction resoiution against
Red China to the UN, we heard a
resolution that would have admitted
Red China to the UN if it had been
approved. It is interesting to note
that the Afro-Asian bloc gave some
support to this resolution, The same
Afro-Asian bloc who wants to sanc-
tion Israel today!

Israel is fighting" for her life. If
all economic and financial aid is
withheld, Israel will become a na—
tion of the past. If through the
United Nations, one tiny nation,
like Israel, can be strangch into
oblivion, why can't it happen to
others? The United States shou‘d
take the lead to see to it that the
nations of the free world remain
free. We should try to remember
that we too were a small nation,
but we were given a chalice to live.
Let's give Israel the same chance!

In a neat change of pace, War-
ners has starred Susan (“I'll Cry
Tomorrow") Hayward and Kirk
(“Lust For Life") Douglas in a light
comedy Top Secret Affair. Don’t be
discouraged by the poor tag given
this solid hunk of celluloid. It’s
loaded with rip-snorting comedy
and of course Miss Hayward. Sec-
ond on the bill is a time-killer
Tension At Table Rock with Rich-
ard Egan and "Battle Cry's" sweat-
er girl, Dorothy Malonc. You can
stock up on popcorn during this
one.

This Technicolor production is def-
initely a must for both art lovers

Written on the Wind is the cur-

fice reports, this one has become
Univcrsul‘s top money maker of the
past twelve months. It‘s not hard
to see why. Rock Hudson. Lauren
Bacall. Robert Stack and Dorothy
Mnlonc are starred in this Techni—
color cpic. This is another involvr-d
tire of the sins and virtues of a

another "Gone With the Wind."
