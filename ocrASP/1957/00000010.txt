Clothes May Bring Fame

ForWell-Dressed Dame

By RARY FITZPATRICK

If you are beautiful, shapely, and
wear clothes (this statement ex-
cludes males although many fall
under the criteria mentioned) you
will undoubtedly be famous. But in
case you meet only the third re-
quirement and wish fame despite
your handicaps, the State College

Deans Welcome
New Students

Tuesday evening at 8 pm, Mys-
kania will hold a coffee hour in
the upper lounge at Brubacher Hall
for the purpose of welcoming the
second semester freshmen and trans-
fer students to State College. an-
nounces Robert Burns ‘57. Vice-
Chairman of Myskania.

At the coffee near the new stu-
dents will be able to meet Deans
Oscar E. Lanford and David Hart-
ley, and Student Association of-
ficers. They will be afforded an
opportunity to discuss State College
life.

Stic

News offers you a chance for pub-
licity and fortune.

Through the aid of another pub-
lication, Glamour Magazine, a spe-
cial committee will select the best
dressed college woman (now do you
males understand why you're not
eligible?) from State who will com-
pete with candidates submitted by
colleges from all over the country.
Ten winners will be selected and
photographed for the August issue
of Glamour and receive the covet-
ed (’9) “Best Dressed" award.

We had an opportunity to hold
election by open ballot but the de—
cision went to the more democratic
idea of a secret committee. The lat-
ter is secret at the present time
mainly because it has not been se-
lected. In judging the contest. how—
ever. the members to be, assure me
that all believe that good grooming,
taste, and planning are more im-
portant than money (although
bribes will be accepted). Details
will follow shortly. The contest may
begin at any time so be sure to be
dressed at any and all times.

The following passage is taken from the Oneonta Star

newspaper.

“Albany State‘s bandbox gymnasium sank its

teeth into Hartwiek‘s running attack . . . Coach Bud Get-
chell’s cagers found 68 feet of ﬂoor—that gym is also
only 36 feet wide—too short for their steam roller tactics,

while the Albanians, trained

to perfection in making use

of their shortcomings, played a deliberate type of posses-

quarter press (that‘s 51 feet) in the
filial quarter which brought points

team."

Now We Ask You

Thus. the fame of Page is spread-
ing around the state. Let's dig into
this masterpiece of journalism. We
ask you now, how can a gym sink
its teeth into an attack. especially
our "gym"?

This attitude on the pzirt of the
()llC‘OlIL'd sportswriter is somewhat
typical of many minds of mentors
from colleges which State might be
able to play if we had a larger gym.
Onc thing which the writer said that
we cannot agree with is the fact
that the Siiitcsmcii played a brand
of possession type basketball in this
game. Is it possible to score eighty-
cight points in a game and play
poSScssion type ball?

()ur Shortcomings

The writer hit the nail on the
head. however, with his statement
about our shortcomings. Ah. well.
there's always room for irnprovc-
irent on those dimensions.

Peds Beaten Polio Match SetiPeds
I3Y N- Br'Ia'" Topple Yeshiva For Fifth

Albany's final invasion of Con-
necticut proved a calamity last Sat-
urday as the Peds received their
third loss of the season. New Britain
led from the onset of the game and
never relinquished the lead.

Paced by Ed Batogowski and Ed
Nardi, the Blue Devils built up a 28-
18 advantage midway through the
ﬁrst half. John Rookwood and Jack
Minon did their best to get State
back into the game at this point as
they led the Feds to within three
points of the Niitmeggers with four
minutes left in the half, 28-25. The
rest of the half saw an exchange of
baskets and the score at half found
New Britain ahead by two, 36-34.

Blue Devils Romp

The roof caved in on the Feds in
the second half as Ryscavage and
Tolls led the Connecticut squad to
a 52-41 lead at the ten-minute
mark and a 60-50 edge with six
minutes remaining. Coach Sauers
had his players go into a full court
press. but the Feds were unable to
penetrate the Blue Devils' ten-point
lead, John Rorikwood and Don
Mayer fouled out with two min-
utes remaining, and New Britain
was able to hold their spread over
the Feds to 12 points.

From the foul line. the Feds hit
on 15 of 29 attempts while New
Britain did much better g‘arnishing
19 of 30. Gary Holway and John
Rookwood led the Albany scoring
with 21 and 19 points respectively.
