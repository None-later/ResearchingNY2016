,,./2¢eaa¢l Ream...

By FRANK VETOSKY

The present top ten tunes are be-
ing seriously threatened by several
recently released records which are
now racing for the big money. Guy
Mitchell has a two-sided winner in
his “Take Me Back Baby" and
“Knee Deep In The Blues," record-
ed for Columbia. “Love Is Strange"
is currently riding very high for
Mickey and Sylvia on the Groove
label. Johnny Ray will soon be
walking in the money with his Co-
lumbia etching of “You Don't Owe
Me A Thing." Columbia has two
more solid moves. “Who Needs You”
by the Four Lads is one; the other
is Terry Gilkyson‘s “‘Marianne."

One of the best records of the
rock and roll vein released in a. long
time is Andy Williams' etching of
"Butterfly" on Cadence. Archie
Bleyer supplies Williams with one
of the most infectious backings
you'll ever hear. You should love
the hand clapping especially. Un-
doubtedly, this recording will be
around for a long time.

“Round and Round" is Perry
Como's new single for Victor. A

Re-e/ections F i/ /
Vacant Offices

Friday. March 1, elections for the
following offices will be held in
lower Draper by absentee ballot:
Treasurer '58, Handbook Editor '59.
Student Board of Finance '59 and
‘60, and Vice-President '60, an-
nounces Jack Tate ’58, Chairman of
Elections Commission.

Election Commission is interest-
ed in a revision of election proce-
dure carried on in the college. The
Commission would like to start
campaigning for class offices with
the eventual beginning of political
parties at State. Any suggestions
from the student body as to elec-
tion procedures would be appreci-
ated.

clever new slant on the prominent
love theme of most of today's songs
is a definite asset here. Como has
a ball singing this tune. He’ll really
rack up this time. Who knows, he
may even sell a million.

The Open Mind informs us that
a tremendous new LP by Bob is
out called “The Devil May Care"
on Durough. Durough, writer and
pianist, sings with an Arkansas ae-
cent ln this album, creating a
pleasingly humorous atmosphere.
The artist tries to duplicate the
sound of musical instruments vocal-
ly. Very modern piano is also feat-
ured in this album. This disc is
rated as a very good buy.

Academy Award Nominations

This week the nominations for
the 1956 Motion Picture Academy
Award winning song were announc—
ed. The tunes nominated were
"Julie" for “Julie,” “Thee I Love"
from “Friendly Persuasion," "Wind"
from the picture of the same name,
“True Love" from “High Society,"
and “What Ever Will Be, Will Be"
from “The Man Who Knew Too
Much." There’s going to be a great
competition between "True Love"
and “What Ever Will Be, Will Be”
as we see it. However, it is our
opinion that the former will take
the top honor.

Classes Meet
Tuesday In Page

A tri-class meeting will be held
Tuesday at 10 am. in Page Hall
Auditorium, according to the presi-
dents of the freshman, Sophomore
and Junior classes. There will be
open discussion concerning the
need and value of political parties
at Albany State.

In a similar meeting last week
discussion centered around the pos-
sibility of a Student Senate or Rep-
resentative type of Government.

Military Officials Discuss
National Guard Duty Plans

By DON DAME

A few weeks ago, Secretary of
Defense, Charles “Bird dog" Wil-
son made certain statements about
the National Guard. In essence, he
said that many young men joined
the National Guard during the
Korean conflict to avoid being
drafted. The National Guard offi-
cials have rebuffed this statement
by pointing out the fact that any-
one or all Guard units could have
been activated during the Korean
“police action" or any other time
when the U. S. so deems.

The Plan

Another point brought out by
Guard assailants is the observation
that the National Guard is not pre—
pared for combat, if and when such
combat should occur. Pentagon of-
ficials have now forwarded a plan
which would aid in remedying the
situation. The plan would call for
six months active duty for all Na—
tional Guard recruits after April 1.

Last week General Maxwell Tay—
lor, Army Chief of Staff. appeared
before the House Armed Forces
Sub-Committee. General Taylor. a
former paratrooper, presented evi-
dence which seemed to support
Wilson’s opinion.

Last year tests were given to Na-
tional Guardsmen, who were doing
summer camp duty, and to Army
recruits finishing their eight weeks

Because of the removal of the
State College News mail box in the
lower Draper peristyle, persons sub-

of basic training. Twenty-five thous-
and Guardsmen from all twenty-
seven Guard divisions were pitted
against 7,000 recruits. Some of the
categories tested were scouting,
patrolling, defense against armor,
use of gas mask. dismounted drill
and night training. The test results
are as follows: 84% of the Army
recruits passed the tests satisfac-
torily whie 56.6% of the Guards-
men succeeded. Many things could
be unreliable on a test of this na—
ture, but this basic inference stands
paramount: National Guard rc—
cruits would benefit from six months
of active duty training.

Earlier this week, Major-General
Willard A. Walsh, the President of
the National Guard Association, ap—
peared before this same House
committee. Walsh said that the six
months' active duty training plan
would ruin the National Guard. The
plan would send 400,000 men from
National Guard Ground Units and
60,000 men from National Guard Air
Units into active training. Walsh
said that the Guard is designed for
men who must hold a civilian job
and others who are completing an
education. The active duty plan
would make potential Guard re—
cruits, who fall in these categories,
shy away from the National Guard.
Readiness?

The National Guard is a front
line of our National Defense. Are
weekly meetings and two week sum-
mer camp sessions adequate to
maintain a high degree of “combat
readiness" in the National Guard?
How could it be? Add six months
of active duty training to these
other activities and then you're get-
ting somewhere. With this added,
you are doing more than “scratch—
ing the surface.” The inconvenience
it would cause seems justified if a
higher degree of “combat readi-
ness" is attained.

Why Waste Talent For Art?
Compete With Draper Painters

By WILLIAM

Here it is! The contest to top all
contests. Forget all about choosing
a caption for a silly old cartoon.
State College is sponsoring an art
contest. Anyone can enter and any-
one can win. You don’t even have
to have talent. All you need is the
abllity to move a brush with paint
on it.

If anyone is interested, he or she
may sign up in Lower Draper. You
might have to look a while to find
the desk because it blends so well
with the walls, but with u little dc-
tcrmlnntion and a flair for color
schemes. it can be found. All you
have to do in this contest is pain!
something. That's all. Any style all
do. Just pulnl. whatever your little
heart desires. The only stipulation
is that the painting must be done
on the walls of Lower Draper, This

should prove to be no problcm
though, since it seems to be the
rage.

if you are interested, and plan on
entering, here's a tip that only help
you to win. When you do your nuis-
ti‘l'lllCCC, choose 21 suitable buck-
ground. Nothing is more dcvustullng

before you start to work. The vari-

choose from may make your choice
difl'icult, but at least you have a

one color to use for their paintings.
