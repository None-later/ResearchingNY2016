STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. MARCH 1. 1957

 

 

 

Cringing Crusaders... Top This . . .

A man can’t walk when he’s sitting down,

and a car won’t run unless

ﬁlls the empty tank with gasoline. Along
these same lines, a revision in our student
government can’t become a reality unless
some of us show more interest in working

for that change.

This past Tuesday, a second combined
meeting of the Junior, Sophomore, and
freshman classes was supposedly to be held
in Page Hall to discuss revision of govern-
ment. The meeting was never called to or-
der—there were too few in attendance to

make discussion worthwhile.

From all appearances it would seem that
the vast majority of our “political experts”
who constantly gripe about student govern-
ment to their friends, but never in public,
are like the man who wants to walk but in-
sists on remaining seated at the same time.
You don’t revise government by stand-

ing on a soapbox in the

the cafeteria. Rather, you voice your opinion
at meetings such as was to be held Tuesday.
We assume the students of this college
consider themselves adults. If this is true,
these students must realize the necessity of
student government. They must also realize
that our present government can’t last long
operating under a patched-up constitution.
The demonstration of interest shown by
the members of these three classes last Tues-
day wasn’t apathetic; rather it was pathet-
it. It’s high time some of the great crusa-
ders in this school stopped hiding behind
their shields and jumped into the battle.

“Can You Top This” was the name of a ,
radio show which featured the telling of '
jokes by famous comedians. The winner
was determined by the amount of laughter
his joke received. Well, we are not famous

comedians nor is our story a joke, and it is

quite certain that we won’t win the Cadil-
lac; but how about this one?

Once upon a time a committee was chos—
en by Student Council to produce a State
College Revue. Now this committee worked
hard to obtain a script and ﬁnally the

given the go ahead. Well, in two weeks this
show is to be staged as the main feature
of our newly initiated Parents’ Weekend. It
only seems reasonable that this committee
and its committees must have rooms in
which to work. Our college was blessed last
with a ﬁne new building called Rich-

In this building are located
make-up rooms, and even a

workshop. Now, everyone knows that these
types of working areas are essential to a
crew which is producing a show, and it
would appear that a student produced, stu—
dent ﬁnanced spectacular such as the Re—
vue would naturally be able to use these
facilities offered by the college for student
use. But, boys, gather around now because
here comes the punch line. You are wrong
—thc State College Revue committee has
been refused the use of these rooms. Now,
we don’t mean to be sarcastic or anything,

Today we are participating and
voting in replacement elections.
Why should we take special note of
another typical State College elec-
tion? This election and the cam-
paign prior to the election may give
us the precedence and experience
needed for a change of government.

The need for a change of govern-
ment at State is obvious to stu-
dents, faculty, and administration.
At this time apathy is the main at—
titude of the student body toward
student government. This lack of
interest is evidenced in many ways.
Attendance at compulory convoca-
tions is extremely low as one may
witness if he attends the convoca-
tions and finds himself alone, with
his nearest neighbor about five
seats away; a picture in the State
College News two weeks ago further
illustrates the low attendance at as—
semblies. The attendance at Student
Council and class meetings is also
at a low ebb, including that of of—
ficers and governman representa-
tives. Lack of interest in govern-
ment at State is further illustrated
by the very low percentage of stu-
dents voting in elections. Approx-
imate figures show that usually lliitl
to 1,000 out of 2,100 vote in an elec-
tion. Class voting figures show that
approximately 250 out oi 550 vote in
a replacement election.

Limited cognizance, knowledge,

By JACK TATE

and understanding of important stu-
dent issues on the part of the stu-
dent body tends to thwart govern-
ment leaders who are attempting to
institute and build effective govern-
ment. The most capable individuals
are not always our representatives
in government as many students,
who are our most able leaders, do
not have the desire to participate
in an ineffective student govern-
ment which is imbued with and dis-
integrating from apathy. The in—
terest of the capable leaders now in
government is stifled because the
student body continuously main-
tains an indifferent, non-cooperat-
ing position.

How has this problem been ap-
proached? Representative govern-
ment was one unsuccessful attempt
to confront the problem of lack of
interest. The fact that the represent-
atives, themselves. did not have the
understanding and interest that is
mandatory in creating ell‘ectivc gov—
ernment led to its failure. We saw this
year another unsuccessful attempt
to improve government in the form
oi compulsory convocations. This
approach in an attempt to allevuitc
apathy was. and is, ineffective as
college students grow to resent be—
ing compelled to do something
that they do not understand and
have no desire to understand. Bi:-

Will interest in revision of gov-

efforts have been «nude on the part
of a few interested Souls to begin
a movement for a revision of stu-
dent government and election pro-
cedures. A ’i‘ri-clziss meeting was
held with the intention of acquir—
ing different opinions and ideas
about a. new gchriuni-ntitl system.
This meeting was attended by up—
proxiniiitely 150 students who, ill :i

intercsted in student government at

“Who, me?"

 

Commem- SW

By FELDMAN and CARBONE

   

“Education is the process of driving a set of prejudices
down your throat!”
REALLY NOW!

Several of the budgets being discussed in Convocation today have i
been drastically cut by the SBF. . . . At least one of these organizations .
has never overdrnwn on any of its lines and had its budget frozen as
did the Student Council.

EXPERIMENT SUCCESSFUL?

We were glad to see the appearance of the “Jacket Journal" and, at
the same time, sorry to hear the indications of its discontinuance. Maybe.
if continued, the experiment could prove to be more successful.
VIDEO VERY VIBRATING

“Look Ma, I’m on TV." Noted dignitaries who visited our new TV
set-up seemed quite impressed. This might be worthwhile to show your
parents on Parents‘ Day.

INTEGRATED MOVEMENTS

Only two weeks to “Plain and Fancy." Start saving those pennies
now! We believe it's something you shouldn't miss . . . oooh! . . . those
bumps and grinds! There'll be a preview in Convocation today.
SURREALISM A’I‘ STATE

It was suggested that the halls not be painted in institution colors.
But, we didn't think it was recommended to have them looking like an
asylum! Oh, well, we always get mixed up with suggested and recom-
mended things around here anyway. PS. We sorta like it.
INGREDIENTS INTERPRETEI) BY INTELLECTUALS

For all apartment dwellers and do-it-yourself—cooks: At State Fair.

. A MODEST PROPOSAL!

A freshman, in public speaking class, outlined the plan for a new

student government. Simple, but effective!

1. NEED—due to increased enrollment and present dissatisfaction
with compulsory convocations.

2. REPRESENTATIVE SENATE—«composed of interested delegates
from the four classes. Committees out of Senate to be composed
of members of SA at large and Senate members.

3. NO RESTRICTIONS on campaigning so We can
really interested and qualified for positions.

4. MYSKANIA ELIMINATED: 
:i. Election Commission to be in charge of voting procedures. i

ballot counting, and announcing results.
h. Senior class committees to be in charge of Rivalry and tradi- l
tioii upholding. l
:3. PREFEREN’l‘iAL SYSTEM ELIMINATED: ‘
ii. increased number of candidates on ballot makes the counting i
and voting oiliiculi. and ridiculous with this present system. i
b. Voting machines would serve well now, iiil(i in future years i
would be looked back on as ii worthwhile experience. i

think Myskunia should be retained as an honorary body since thiit is
what it‘s known to be and supposed to be.

By ART PLOTNIK

In view of the fact that there is
so much controversy about the new
colors in the halls, even within this
edition of the News, I feel impelled
to present what I consider to be an
open-minded discussion of the mat-
ter. I am The Open Mind, you re-
member.

Against the New Colors:

It's different. It ain't traditional.
Black don‘t go With purple, does it?
Pink bulletin boards ain‘t gonna
stand out against orange. Black
probably costs more than the Old
paint I think. Nobody asked us if
they could do this to the walls
we‘ve cherished enough to ignore.
What're outsiders gonna think?
Why don't they paint it some pretty
pink or blue like my kid brudder's
playroom? It ain't red, white, and
blue like America, Black is the color
of the bad guy.

For the. New Colors:

The planner has studied color and
liarriiony far longer than we have
studied things irrelevant to the col-
or scheme, "(letting used" to the
colors is n gradual experience, emo—
tionally or aesthetically. and cor-

an answer, however, in achieving
better government at State The
iiiisvvcr of course must be in ere—

does the replacement election this
Friday iil, into the picture? Elec-
tion Commission this week made a
reVolutionary ruling in relation to
campaign practices. Prior to this
ruling, campaigns were on an im-
mature, highly restrictive basis. The
(.‘oininission, being active and pro-
gressive tor ii change, ruled that
"candidates are now able to conduct
campaigns unrestrained from rules
pertaining to exixmditurcs, posters,
rallies, and speeches." This ruling
is the key in eradicating our dilem-
mu lack of interest and lack of
good govcriiiinciit. Students feel that
they are now able to carry on lllli-
iiirc campaigns, attacking and de-
iending policies and (:iilidlfititL‘S.

tainly not a snap judgment. In fact,
we passed final judgment on the
situation long before its completion,
an act which we would consider ab-
surd in the construction of a build-
ing. A bleak, monotonous, unchang-
ing hall is as depressing as a stag—
nant student government, a dull
lecture, and an airtight day-to-day
routine. We scream and whine for
progress, and when it comes we fail
to recognize it. The new colors are
definitely progressive ior is “pro-
gressive” too dangerous a word to
use'h.

You don't have to like it, you
know. But at least give it a chance.
Of course for the fifteen-hundred
or so of you who follow my sugges-
tions to the letter, I need say no
more. To the rest I say, buy either
a pair of blinders or a real tight
gag.

PALACE

Full of Life with Judy Holllday,

critical reviewer. Also showing is
Ride the High Iron with Don Tay-
lor, Sally Forrest and Raymond Burr.
STRAND

Men in War with Robert Ryan and
Aldo Ray. “This is it! The brawl-
ing, screaming, hell-boiling gut
loaded combat story." Grr! This is
the story of “The part of the mili-
tary machine that bleeds!" “Now it
exploded out into the open —- the
trigger-hot hate between the Lieu—
tenant who’d lead his men any—
where — and the Sergeant who'd
follow him into hell . . just to
get even!" Wow! The second sus-
pense-packed feature is Crime of
Passion with Barbara Stanwyck,
Sterling Hayden and Raymond Burr.
LELAND

Blonde Sinner starring Diana
Dors. “See the shocking secrets of
this warped world of caged females."
“The man-by-man story of a lost
soul!" Also showing is The Deadli-
est Sin. “A startling story of dain-
aged souls!" iSouls get a rugged
workout by'these two gems.)
RI’I‘Z

Casablanca with Humphrey Bo-
gart, Ingrid Bergman, Claude
Rallies, and Sidney Greenstreet.
The second feature is They Died
With Their Boots On with Errol
Flynn and Olivia DeHaviland, The
story of Custer's last stand. "Where'd
all these Indians come from?" Both
are re—leases worth seeing again.
DELAWARE

The Grand Maneuver starring Mi—
chele Morgan and Gerald Philipe.
A romantic comedy as only the
French can get away with. Dialogue
in French with English subtitles.
MADISON

not essential. The name of the final
contestant from Albany State will
