STATE COLLEGE N'Ei‘ivs, FRIDAY”, MARCH 1, 1957

 

Student Council:

Members ‘jArrange‘. Plans
.For Future College Events

' ' Student Council meeting was cal-

led to order by Clyde Payne, Presi-
dent of Student Association, Mon-
day of this week because of a
basketball game scheduled for Wed-
nesday. Committee chairman an-
nounced that everything is under
control in arrangements for the
State College Revue and Parent’s
Weekend.

Lorraine Kozlowski, '58, chairman,
reported to Council that there well
be thirty-ﬁve groups participating
in this year’s annual State Fair.
The faculty is holding a rafﬂe, and
chances will be sold by Student
Council members for a week pre-
ceding the fair. The rafﬂe itself
promises to be quite unusual and
surprising.

There 'WaS a discussion held on
points which Council felt necessary
to bring up before the Student Fac-
ulty Committee at its next meeting.
All members seem to agree that
students should be granted more say
on matters which concern them es-
pecially ion the curriculum. Public

relations including publicity for col-
lege functions in newspapers of the
vicinity need promoting. The com-
mittee will also discuss any possi-
bility of improving classroom equip-
ment which may be inefficient or
dangerous. Council hopes that some
action can be initiated by the com-
mittee which will discuss and con-
sider these matters.

Honor Society
Plans Meeting

Kappa Mu, the honorary mathe-
matics fraternity, will hold its next
meeting Thursday, March 14, at 8
pm. in Draper 349, according to
Robert Stimson ’57, President. Mr.
Edmund B. Whittaker, Vice-Presi-
dent of The Prudential Insurance
Company of America, will be guest
speaker for the evening.

This will be an open meeting, and
anyone interested is invited to at-
tend. Refreshments will be served.

Perhaps while shuffling through
these venerable halls one day, you
were stopped by a pair of startling-
ly blue eyes—or maybe they caught
yours in a class—a Political Science
class. They are owned by a noted
author and professor at State Col—
lege—one Robert Rienow.

Born in Wisconsin, he attended
college at Carthage, Illinois, where
he majored in Political Science, His-
tory, and track. iHe was captain
of the team and still holds the
colege record for the two—mile.)
After graduation, Uncle Sam, in the
form of track at West Point, called.
Mr. Rienow completed his plebe
year there, then resigned and ac-
cepted a principalship in Sussex,
Wisconsin.

He received his Master's and
Ph.D. degrees at Columbia Gradu—
ate School as a Guilderfellow (which
means money in exchange for bril-
liance, gangil. During this time. he
was also granted a fellowship for
research at Ohio State University.

In 1934 and 1935, he taught at
Union College and in 1936 he be-
came an instructor at State College.

‘—

With the publication of his Disserta-
tion in 1937, the writing bug hit with
all its might. However, World War
II broke out and our hero entered
the United States Army as a private.
He served in the Southwest Pacific
and was commissioned in Australia.
He came out of the service in 1946
as a First Lieutenant and is now a
Colonel in the National Guard.

Most of his spare time has been
devoted to writing, a vocation which
is shared by his wife. In 1943 he
published his first text for the ninth
grade, and has since published two
twelfth grade and two college Poli-
tical Science texts. He has recently
completed the manuscript for an
eighth grade text as well.

B e side s his Army-sponsored
jaiints, he and his wife have travel-
ed extensively. On his first Sabbat-
ical in 1948, they went through
Northern Europe and England; in
1953. they toured Egypt, Lebanon,
Syria, and Southwest Europe; in
1956, on Sabbatical, they traveled
through England and West Ger-
many, in connection with work on
a book of International Politics. In
Germany, he was studying particu-
larly the feasibility of neutraiixa—
tion. While there, he and his wife
were the guests of Hcrr Heck. Chair—
man of the Christian Democratic
Party. He feels that the country's
recovery has been significant. There
is a strong Pacifist conviction, but
he "scnscci an affinity with the
American concch of material ad-
ianccmciit,” citing the display win—
dows of machine tools as :,in cxaiiipic.

In connection wilh this book
(which will be completed in about
a year and half), he is experiment—
in;r with Political Science 131. It
is a course closed to Social
Studies majors and minors, 111 which
he is trying to give a knowledge of
the Politics of International Rola-
lionships to students.

Another of his avocations is i'oii—
scrvation, and he runs a lilo-acre
poultry farm about twclvc mill-s
from the college. He owns a thou-
sand chickens and works with tree
lul'mll‘lg. He is Chairman oi the
Eastern New York Chapter of Na-
ture Conservancy, and is on the
National Board of Governors of this
organization, Its purpose is to par-
Cll'zLSt' and set aside natural lll't‘llh
ior future use. He is actch in the
New York State Political Science
Association, and last May coinplct-
cd his term as its Prcsidvnt.

At this point, I had planned lo
"analyze" some of his teaching
methods from a student viewpoint,
and to this purpose I sat in on one
of his classes. I look the following
notes, with which I will close:

"Slicer logic!" "Vl\'l(l laiigiiacr“
"tlylllllllll'lik‘lllil‘l'”. "fantastic eyes!”

' Gutterdusters
. Top Bowlers

The IM Bowling schedule proved
to be quite interesting last week as
the ﬁrst place Gutterdusters were
pitted against their closest follow-
er’s, Ridge, while SLS and the Vets
fought for sole possession of third
place.

After the score sheets were tallied
the front-runners still retained a
comfortable 4 game spread by tak-
ing three out fo four, thanks mostly
to “Stretch” Lesnieski's 503 triple.
A powerful Vet squad meanwhile
were victims of some “way over your
head" bowling scores and dropped
not only 4 points but also possession
of third place. Despite the sweep
by SLS, Tom Digcsarc proved to be
the day's top star with a high 204
single and 560 triple.

Three Way Tie

APA and KB at the same time
became deadlocked for fourth with
the Vets as a result of KB's 3-1 con-
quest of the Madison Avenue men.
Arnie Newman's 499 proved to be
the big difference.

eds Split Weekend Contests;

Bowlers Split
With Siena "5".

Host Siena found the going a
little rough this week as they were

forced to split their contest with
State—in bowling that is.

Not following the pattern set by
the Fed cage team, the fourth place
Teachers captured tivo close wins
from the Loudonville Indians.

Another pattern that the States-
men did not follow this week was
that of relying on anchorinan Tom
Sullivan for the heavy wood. Irv
Peterson and Jim Lorrichio stepped
into the spotlight as they rolled 526
and 380 ltwo gamesr respectively.

Lorrichio Best

After dropping a 802—728 decision,
Jim Lorrichio substituted for a
slipping Sullivan and hit the maples
for an even 200 tally. Irv backed
him up with a 186 effort to give the
Albanians a 28 pin victory. The final
game saw Lorrichio bear the burden
of carrying the Purple and Gold
to a :1 pin conquest of the wild
Indians. I‘hc victory failed to help
capture total wood, however, and the
nearby rivals drew a 2-2 split.

Kampf Kommcnts:

Bang, Bang, Bang
Went The Drum

 

The referee calls a technical foul, and a roll of Angel
Soft angles out onto the court and unwraps across the
floor. Tempers flare and fans begin to jeer.

Such was the case in the second half during the State-
Siena game last Saturday night in the crowded Armory.
This was a harsh example of the wrath of basketball fol-
lo' era. In a game such as the one played Saturday night,
the referees are at a handicap because of the tension
among supporters of both squads. Granted, the ofﬁcials
might have made a few mistakes, but the Siena fan who
threw said commodity didn't use any forethought before

heaving his missile.

We have one thing to say for one

other fan, anybody here play a bass drum?
RPI (lame To Close 1956-57 Season

Once again next Saturday there will be another Tri-
City rivalry. This time it‘s RPI and State in Page Gym.
Rivalry between the Pods and the Engineers has been

going on for years.

Last year, the first Saucrs coached

State team lost to Kalbaugh’s Engineers by a more marker.
Coach Kalbaugh is at the present momrnt recuperating

in Saint Mary‘s Hospital from a recent illness.

We hope

he'll be out by next Saturday and sitting on the RPI bench

in Page.

By sinking twclvc out of fourteen foul shots, and ten

out of his last (‘l(‘V(‘ll,

Iaptain Jack Minon increased his

NAIA standing in ion] shooting percentage to 85.1. This
pcrcentagc should put him near the top ten in l'oulshooting.

Statesmen Nip Oneonta
In Close Contest; Lose
To Siena In Armory

State split a pair of contests over
the weekend to take their season
record to 14-4 prior to the Wednes-
day night game with Utica. Last
Friday, the Peds vanquished Oneon-
ta State in a close contest, 71—69,
for their fourteenth victory, but
were unable to break the Siena jinx
on Saturday as the Indians won
their sixth straight from the Peds,
75-66.

Tomorrow night, the Fed pack will
play host to Plattsburgh State. In
their ﬁrst meeting earlier this year,
Albany emerged victorious in a
tight tussle in Plattsburgh, 80—73.
On Tuesday, the Peds will travel

to Oswego for the next to last game
of the season.

Oneonta Tough

Oneonta jumped out to a 40-30
halftime edge Friday night with
Jester and Shawson leading the
way. The second half was just as
tight as the difference between the
two teams never exceeded four
points. Oneonta could garnish but
six ﬁeld goals in the half, however,
as Albany scored 13 to edge out the
home squad. John McDonough
played a sharp game for the Peds
both on defense and ofi‘cnse. Gary
Holway took scoring honors with 24
points.

Sixth For Siena

Coach Sauers‘ charges were un-
able to break the Siena dominance
of State-Siena games on Saturday,
as the Indians went home with
their sixth consecutive victory over
State.

In the early moments of the game
with Joe Anderson tallying four
points and Minon and Mayer each
getting two, the Peds moved in
front. There were repeated ties
throughout the major part of the
first half, but when the intermission
came, Siena held a one point edge,
29-28.

In the second half, the Indians
increased their lead after a while,
and commenced to freeze the ball
as much as possible. 'l‘hcir tactics
caused the Statesmen to foul, and
the Loudonvillc squad was able to
hold their lead as the half elapsed.

The game was slow starting, and
field goal shooting in the first half
was poor, the Peds hitting oiin 33
per cent of their shots.

C age Forfeits

As a result of three forfeits regis-
tered in WAA basketball competi-
tion Wednesday, WAA ofﬁcials ex-

disinterested groups included Pierce,
Psi Cam and KD who dropped their
matches to Gamma Kap, Phi Delt
and El merely by their absence
from the scene.

If forfeits continue to constitute
the basis for wins next week, WAA
ofﬁcials have warned that they will
terminate league activities in the
sport.

Peds Drop MIT Match;

Face RPI In Season Finale

By DAVE MILLER

Al Tuttle and Don Biiidrim put
on some of the best wrestling seen
this season in Page Hall, but lost
their matchs as the Peds found MIT
just a bit too strong for them in
dropping last Saturday's match by
.i 13-19 score.

'I‘wo win streaks were halted and
a third continued as Tom Farrell
emerged the only unbeaten member
of the terrible trio of Farrell, Har-
vey, and Kane by pinning his man
at the 1:46 mark for his seventh
straight win by pin, The high point
man has collected 35 points for the
Garcian grapplers who now own a
5-2-1 record.

Heavy End Bolstercd

A couple of bright rays shown
through the clouds of defeat, how-
ever, as Joel Smith showed more
strength in the sagging heavyweight

division to gain his second pin in a
row and insure the important an-
chor spot for State; Coach Garcia
also announced after the match that
Charlie Kane. who left too much
weight in the steam room, would go
up to 157 to bolster that spot and
be replaced by Bob Bosomworth at
147. Bob won a decision in the 157
pound class last Saturday.

The final match of the season to-
morrow pits RPI against the Peds
in a 2:30 match. Lucky number
programs and a prize to the 150th
person to enter will be given away
at this time. The summary: Far-
rell won by pin, 1:46; Harvey lost
by pin, 4:35; Bindrim lost by deci-
sion; Kane lost by decision; Bosom—
worth won by decision; Miano lost
by pin, 1:00; Tuttle lost by decision;
Smith won by pin, 8:00.
