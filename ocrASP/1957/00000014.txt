United States Threatens Use
Of Force In Middle East

By FRAN K SWISKEY

The Middle East, the link that
connects three continents, Asia, Af-
rice and Europe, is vitally import-
ant economically, politically, and
geographically. This is the area
that most concerns the “Eisenhower
Doctrine", the pledge of the United
States to defend this vital area
against Communist aggression.
The Gordian Knot

The complexity and the situation
that makes this land a keynote of
violence and continual struggle can
best be seen by the factors that
make it so. The factors under con-
cern are geographic, economic. stra-
tegic and political.

The Suez Canal Crisis aptly em-
phasized the geographic importance
of this area. The blocking of this
vital waterway struck home to many
nations in the most potent way pos-
sible. through the wallet. Oil is an
expensive commodity especially
when most of it is controlled by
one man. A geographic factor us-
ually not recognized is that all
major air routes from North Ameri-
ca and Europe to Southern Asia
go through this area. If the air-
ways were blocked by hostile na—
tions, it would mean huge. vulner-
able, expensive detours.

The economic importance of this
area cannot be measured. This
region of sand and blood contains
70% of the world's known oil re-
serves. West Europe utilizes 75'?
of this supply. Without it NATO
would not function; West Europe
would have to revert militarily to
pre-World War I standards, “The
Ox-Cart Army of Serbia".

Strategically, the Middle East can
be seen either of two ways, free or
part of the Soviet Union behind the
Iron Curtain. The former would
constitute a strong link in the chain
that deters the Soviet Union from
its plans of world dominance. The
latter view would see the following

situation. Soviet armor and air
power would outﬁank India and
Europe. Russia would be a Mediter-
ranean power, a quest sought after
since the time of Catherine the
Great. The strategic air bases of
Dhahran, and Wheeler’s Field would
be lost. The key to domination of
the world would be in the hands of
cold, calculating madmen.

The political aspect of the Near
East can be described in one word—
dangerous-dangerous because of the
following thoughts involved. Nation-
alism, which is a raging dominant
ﬁre in this area. frequently express-
es itself through anti-western de-
monstrations and policies, the am-
bitions of Russia to rule this area
which have been thwarted so many
times by Britain and France.
Neither one is a deﬁnite threat as
demonstrated by the flops of the
last bit of “gunboat diplomacy”.
Lastly, there are two conﬂicting
views which simply stated are “Jew”
versus “Arab”. The ﬂame of the
Arab-Israeli War in 1948 is still
smouldering in the ashes of Arab
defeat.

The Doctrine

The areas covered in Mr. Eisen-
hower‘s doctrine are basic. Econ-
omic and military aid and the use
of armed forces to prevent any
Communist aggression that might
arise in countries needing this as—
sistance.

The threat of the use of force in
this already turbulent area is made
with one and one intention only,
that is to deter and prevent the
aggression of the Soviet Union in
this bloody wasteland. The United
States in taking this stand is hop-
ing to co-operate with the United
Nations in bringing about true
world peace. It is often said that
the best way to ﬁght ﬁre is with
ﬁre. “Mrs. O’Leary, your cow
please "

By NATALIE LEMOINE

Twa weeks ago there appeared in
this column a bit called “What is a
College Boy?" Here is the other
side of the picture from the Item-
selaer Polytechnic.

What is a Coed?

Between the innocence of bobby-
sox and the sophistication of mink
there lies a curious, carefree crea-
ture called a coed.

Ecclesiastics
Conduct Pane/s,
Bible Meetings

Three religious oranizations an-
nounce their plans for this week.
Included are a supper meeting, a
panel discussion, and a weekend
conference.

Lucy Schneider ’58, Publicity Di-
rector of the Inter-Varsity Chris-
tian Fellowship, announces that a
supper meeting will be held Sunday
at the Albany Bible Institute. Elec-
tions will be held at this time for
the new ofﬁcers. Transportation
will be provided from Pierce Hall at
six o'clock.

Thursday there will be a panel
discussion on “How the Bible is the
Word of God to me." Included in
the program is an open discussion
period which will take place after
the panel members have spoken.

The Lutheran Student Association
announces the meeting of their an-
nual conference at Buck Hill FllllS
in the Poconos of Pennsylvania. It
will be held this weekend and will
be attended by ﬁve hundred Luth-
eran students from colleges and
universities in the Northeastern
region of the United States. The
theme for the weekend will be, “The
Bible as an Authority". Those at~
tending from State College include
Gale Klelman, Dorothy Davis, Wal-
ter Heins, Svcrre Samuelson. Sopho-
mores, and Bob Wilkinson '60.

Coeds come equipped with assort-
ed burmudas and hairdos, but they
all uphold the same creed: to enjoy
every minute of every college day.

Teachers ﬁuster them, mothers
protect them, little sisters idollzc
them, and boys worship them.

They can be found in all places:
lounging on, draped around, lean-
ing against. and traipsing from.
She is pride with a pony tail, non-
chalance with a notebook, optimism
with an overcoat, and the prettiest
of womanhood in wool.

A coed is a curious mixture. She
has the eating habits of u canary
and displays the energy of a inclin-
tain trout. To her admirers she has
the mind of Einstein, the looks of
Kim, the personality of Grace. and
the figure of Marilyn. To the other
coeds, she has the form of u beer
bottle. the personality of wet muck-
erel, and the mind of ii beetle.

She leads a nuirtyr's life. No one
else could stand time limits on
telephone calls. the lrustration of
stolen bobbypins, and the pain of
waiting l'or a date.

The coed lives weekends, i'ormal
dances, cashmere sweaters, red con-
vertibles, and men.

She doesn't like 8 o‘clock classes,
Mondin mornings, and deadlines.

No one else can prick into 24 hours
five classes, two hours study. three
collcc breaks, a full length movie,
and eight hours sleep.

Wildlife Films
Highlight Meeting

A meeting of the Biology Club will
be held Tuesday in Brubacher Hall
at 7:3.) pm. Two ﬁlms will be
shown at that time. The ﬁrst, en-
titled "Dividends in Ducks", is a
wildlife nature film as is the other,
“Snakes Are Interesting". Biology
Department faculty members will be
present for discussion about the
films. All students who are interest-
pd are invrtcd to attend this meet-
ng.

Penguin For
State College

A new publication will appear on
the State College scene Monday.
The Penguin, announces Feature
Editor Art Plotnik '59. will be avail—

able to all students and faculty
members. This magazine will be
distributed in the Lower Draper
peristylc.

Penguin is neither a straight
humor nor a completely literary
magazine. It will contain a wide

variety of topics including art, mu-
sic. fiction, satire, and articles by
students and faculty members alike.
In this issue Arthur N. Collins. As-
sociate Professor of English, and
Edward Cowley, Associate Professor
of Art, have both written articles.

The Penguin is a revival of u for-
mer State College magazine, The
Statesman. However. The Statesman
placed an emphasis on fiction and
off-color humor, whereas the Pen-
guin will be more varied in nature.
This is an experimental issue, and
its future pub.ication will depend
on its initial success. Tentatively,
the Penguin is planned as a quar-
tcrly magazine.

Approximately $425 has been ap—
propriately from Student Association
surplus for this issue. Future Pen-
quins will be partly supported by
advertising.

The staff of the Penguin are as
follows: Joseph Flynn ’58, Manag-
ing Editor; Art Plotnik '59, Feature
Editor; John Reiners '57, Critical
Editor; Linda and Joan Macroy.
Juniors, Co-Art Editors; Rosemary
