The loop’s top man on the totem

hit the coveted goal without a pm

Wind Up In The
Manager's Mind

 

 

“Well, it’ll be all over after tonight. Can‘t say that I’m
sorry because now I can put my mind back on the text
books and dispense with this one Page. The other guys
must all be tired of traveling and playing by now. Even
Coach looks worn down or else he smashed his foot on
something in the last game.

Who would have thought twenty-one games ago that
we were going to have such a fabulous season? 16-5. Not
bad at all. Sure would like to make it 17-5 against those
Engineers.

Wonder if the Trojans will bring their band. Last
week we had a good time with the Plattsburg crowd. Sure
could use a new gym around here, but I guess Page is
tradition now and who wants to change tradition? Maybe
by 1060. _ .

Hate to see the Seniors ﬁnish up, we’re gomg to miss
Rocky, Jack, Joe and HOp next year.

Wonder if my set is working. Hmm, maybe I better
stick to my jump shot. Nope, nothing seems to want to
go in today. Better take a few foul shots. Gees, I’ll never
have a Minon percentage with this kind of shooting. Good
thing Coach isn't around to see this ﬁasco, he’d never
start me. Come to think of it, it’s been quite a while since
I've started a game.

Four-thirty already, time to get over to the Mayﬂower.
Hope Coach doesn't find any mistakes in the scorebook,
I did my best to keep things straight.”

Penguin Makes Appearance Tonight

An added attraction at tonight’s game will be the
arrival of Pete, the Penguin. Surprised? Don’t be. Just
come and see him.
