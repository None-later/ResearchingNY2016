STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. MARCH 8. 1957

Decision Results In State Bowlers

Threat Of Violence, Revolt

By non

Last week the Israeli government
indicated that she would favor-
troop withdrawal from the Gulf of
Aqaba and the Gaza Strip areas.
The United States was quite pleased
to hear this good news. Underlying
this good news are several prob-
lems.

The announcement has brought
serious repurcussions within Israel.
The government of Premier David
Ben-Gurion is faced with political
revolt and the threat of violence by
the opposition. Ben-Gurion's deci-
sion to act without the immediate
approval of the Israeli parliament
has created serious opposition. Earl-
ier this week, additional provincial
police have been moved to Jerusa-
lem in order to prevent any possi-
ble rioting in the streets of the Holy
City. A short time after the an-
nouncement. one could see signs
saying “Ben-Gurion, your time is
up.” The walls of the city’s build-
ings have become billboards for the
opposition’s wrath.

Bargaining Power

Opponents of the Premier‘s move
feel that Israel's bargaining power
would be much greater if she had
held her Sinai Desert positions.
These aforementioned positions were
only 10 miles from the Suez Canal.
The Premier's latest decision has led
many Par.iament deputies to regard
the last four months of negotiations
as a complete waste. The situation
in Israel bears watching.

The United Nations has voiced no
opposition to .he temporary occu-

DAME

pation of the withdrawal area by
the United Nations Emergency
Forces (U.N.E.F.). The problem
areas are (1) The right to fair pas-
sage through the Strait of Tiran
into the Gulf of Aqaba. This stipu-
lation is forwarded by Israel and is
upheld by the US. and other mari-
time powers. Countries backing this
proposition contend that the Strait
oi Tiran is an international passage-
way through which Israeli and other
shipping is entitled to free shipping;
«21 The eventual administration of
the Gaza Strip and 300,000 Arabs, a
majority of them Palestine refugees
living on United Nations relief al-
lotments. These are two problems

which the United Nations must re-
solve before any final decision rs
made.

Civilian Direction

Meanwhile Dr. Ralph Bunche, win-
ner of the Nobel Peace Price in 1950
for his Palestine activities, is ex-
pected to take charge of the U.N.E.F.
in Egypt. Dr. Bunche is presently
an Assistant Secretary General of
the United Nations. This move
would put the U.N.E.F. under civ-
ilian direction at the very pinnacle
of its activities.

If Israel does go ahead and with-
draws her troops. then Egypt must
stay out. Ben-Gurion told Israeli
political leaders that if Egyptians
returned to the Gaza Strip “we
have it in our powers to send them
back into their own territory in one
day." The fuse on the powder keg
is being dampened. Let no nation
strike a match.
