(NATION DESERVE)

We congratulate £.-'-'~'aine and her crew on a very fine State Fair.
We only thank God, however that we won't be here anotar year to
be bored with some of the organizations who present the Sallie booths
year after year. Potter Club set a perfect example of variety with in-
genuity, originality. and a darn funny show. Maybe more groups
ought to follow along.

P.S. Myskania was reany all wet that night. We hope they've dried
out for Convocation today!

REMEMBER WHERE THE MONEY (‘OMES FROM

Henry Ward Beecher once said. "There is no friendship. no love.
like that of the parent foi the child." This might sound sentimental, but
it's true and we igrcc with it. What about the parents who haven't
been personally invited?

EDUCATED PIGEONS

It's been said that many courses around this institution are "for the
birds." We never took this literally until several of our ﬁne feathered
friends came to classes this week.

VITALITY LACKING

The long awaited "Penguin" ﬁnally made its grand entrance much
to our disappointment We agree with many other opinions that it was
not representative of State. Aside from a li‘\\ cxceptions, the material
was mediocre and it looked more like a weak attempt at an intellectual
newsletter than a college humor inagéittinc. We suggest more humor.
some advertisements. and stories of quality. Page should be enraged.
Minerva should blusn. and the Penguin should change color if drastic
revision isn't accomplished before the next issue. . . . We did think the
letter to the editor was very well taken.

IT'S A THOUGHT

If all the speakers in the world were laid out end to end, it would be
a darn good thing

Myskania keeps cici'ything they do a st‘t'i'i-l. We respect llll‘ll‘ right
to do so. Student Council has only one thing a year they keep a secret.
and that's Moving-Up Day speakers. Wcll. Motiday night, after a three

Progress Is . .

Time and time again we have been cri-
tical of many racets of life at State College.
Now, we would like to take the opportunity
to indicate some of the more important
advances that have been made this year.

State Fair this past weekend was a ﬁne
example of cooperation between the two
State-minded parties—faculty and stu-
dents. Much criticism has been heaped upon
student-faculty relations. We have two facts
for you to consider before you condemn
State in this respect. We have been given
much freedom in our college affairs that
has instilled in us an independency that
does not allow for faculty participation.
We, ourselves, have declared many activi-
ties “off limits” for the faculty. For this
reason we would consider their participa-
tion an unwarranted intrusion, and for this

reason the faculty does not
many ﬁelds of activity.

Today the last section of this year‘s
Pedagogue was sent to the publisher. The
staff has given unselfishly of its time and
energy to one State activity that receives
little acknowledgment but a gigantic
amount of criticism. For once when this
book reaches our hands in June let's say

thanks.

Besides these two major improvements
we have seen appear on our campus—a
Parents' Day, a humor magazine, a Broad-
way show, open campaigns,
Winterlude and Junior Prom, and a win-
ning basketball and wrestling team.

We’re asking,

Question . . .

Myskie isn’t frisky anymore. In the past,
the Senior honorary has been held in high
esteem by the student body as a whole,
not merely by the Sophomores and fresh-
men, as it is presently. Myskania‘s
prestige has sunk to a low ebb since the
present Junior Class entered this college.
Supposedly, the thirteen act as the judi-
cial branch of our government. Actually,
what judicial powers does Myskania posseSS
that don’t cease to exist at the end of
Rivalry? Should it serve as a branch of
our government, or should it be limited in
such a way that it becomes a resting place
for those Seniors who have earned such a
reward for active participation in student

These are questions we would like an-
swered, and by the people who should know,

a few weeks we are to elect

your successors. How shall we elect them—
for their governmental abilities, their en-
tertaining abilities, or shall we elect them
because we like them, and that’s all?

In short, are we to elect an honor so-
ciety, or a branch of our government?
We’d like to know, Myskania, and you can
supply the answers.

By LLOYD SEYMOUR
be. a great many students just
DON'T care about student govern-
ment?

Perhaps one of the basic things
wrong here is the misplacement of
emphasis. Student government, so
obviously not a concern of much of
the school, is greatly emphasized,
while other things, just as import-
ant, take a back seat. On entering
State, the freshman sees student
government held up and glorified in
Mys nia; the ultimate achieve-
in stuoyy-Signum Laudis—is scarce-
ly known about by the frosh. There-
fore, government should be cie-
emphasised. Then the supposedly
inconsequential aspects of college
life. —— studies, activities, sororities,
fraternities —— could be brought to
the fore. These important. elements
could then attain the place they
nierit, without their efforts being
slipped by student government.

At this point you must think I
want to do away with all student
government. Nothing is farther from
my mind; student government is an
essential part of our college. The
point is that it is a part of the
whole ~IIOL the whole. Therefore, it
should be set up on a minimum
basis, including only essentials. Do
we need a Convocation? Couldn‘t a
Senate handle matters sufficiently,
an SA petition provided? Do we
need a Myskaiiia? Is it a carry-

- - @ne Maul @pﬁu‘an - - -

over from the feudal system? Does
it do more than count votes? Should
it be primarily a governing body, an
honorary body, a glory body, or
what? Its place now is certainly
ambiguous. If it is primarily a gov-
erning body, why should being a
good entertainer or head of a clcan-
up committee be a prerequisite for
it? If Myskania were removed, the
people on Senate would then be
those who were sincerely intere~tcd
in the running of our govcrnn‘iciit;
Senate would not be a. stepping-
stone, since nothing would be galli-
ed from being on it except the sat-
iSlElthtloi'i of helping to run the school
we .

Since a great many students do
not care how their school is run, it
would definitely be most advantage-
oils for everyone to let the k’lllll't‘
student body be represented by :i
smaller, more interested. and llltll't'
capable body, namely, a Senate.
This strong nucleusﬁ—thc Sciiati

basic work, not the extraneous finit-
ter that now wastes so much fun--
These secondary affairs could be
treated by two or three major sub»
committecs, working in conjunction
with the Senate. The exact set-up
of this Senate is a problem for con‘
sideration. Its need is (lL‘lllllft.'L
what remains is the i-caliziition of
this theory.

Universities In
Spain Offer
Study Programs

Spanish universities will offer
American students a program of
study and travel during the months
of July and August. College and
professional growth credits will be
alloted for the special course which
will be given at the Universities of
Barcelona, Burgos, Cadiz, Madrid,
Oviedo, Pziinplona, Santander, Sati-
tiago de Compostela, Segovia, Se-
ville, Valladolid, and Zaragoza.

The program is one of low-cost
and in addition to this courtesy,
cards are issued to American stu-
dents which allow them reduced
rates on books, travel, medical care,
theatres, museums, student restaur-
ants, and hotels.

A highlight of the program will
be a study offered by the Institute
of Hispanic Culture, an official
agency of the Spanish government.
The extent of the course will be
from July 1 to 31 and will be re-
peated from August 1 to 31. Includ-
ed in a blanket fee of $150 will be
tuition, diploma, board and lodge
at Colegios Mayores in Madrid, and
sightseeing and excursions to near-
by “Art Towns." Spanish language,
history, culture, literature, art, and
music courses will be conducted by
professors from the University of
Madrid.

The termination of both sessions
will provide an optional opportunity
to tour Andalucia, including visits
to Seville, Malaga, Granada, Cor-
doba, and Cadiz. The cost of this
tour will be $90. To apply for the
Institutes program write the Educa-
tional Travel Association, 554 Fifth
Avenue, New York.

In Madrid a similar course of
cultural study will be given by the
Department of Cultural Relations
from July 1 to August 11. A $90 fee
will cover tuition and lodging at
the University hall for the six
weeks.

Organization of courses in other
Spanish universities mentioned will
follow a similar procedure. For
additional information on these
courses students should contact the
Cultural Relations Office, Embassy
of Spain, Washington 9, D. C.
