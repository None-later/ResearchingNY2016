Kampf Komments:

The Best Years
Of Our Lives

By looking over the modern record books, which in-
clude the seasons from 1946 on, we found that this sea-
con was by far the best that State College has had since
that time.

The best record any previous State team was able to
muster was in the 1953—54 season when the Feds of that
year ran up a 13-7 season. From 1946—1951, Albany never
had a winning season. Then for three years, the tables
turned and the Peds racked up seasons of 11-7 and 12-9
to go along with the 1953 campaign. The roof fell in dur-
ing the ‘54-55 season season as the Penguins were able to
take but two games, one from Potsdam and the other from
New Paltz.

Sauers Arrives On The Scene

After that dismal season, Coach Richard Sauei‘s took
over. In his freshman year, the Feds had a winning sea—
son of 11-9. As we all know now, in the now concluded
campaign, the Feds ran up a 17-5 record.

Some of the new records set this year as well as records
tied are as follows: This was the ﬁrst year that a State
team was undefeated in Page . . . the eight game winning
streak in the beginning of the year tied the longest win—
ning streak set by the 1953~54 team . . . the 82.18 average
per game this year is the highest ever accumulated by a
State team, breaking the previous record set by the 1953-54
squad . . . Hartwick, Brooklyn Poly and RPI were all beaten
for the ﬁrst time since 1946.

Individual Marks Set

Gary Hoiway’s 486 points along with his 497 of last
year equals more than Bill Walker’s four—year total of
868. . . . Another Holway mark is his 40 points against
Utica, highest for a State player. . . . Page Gym record is
held by Karl Luebbert of Utica (1951), 41 points. . . . Gary
has also broken the single season ﬁeld goals scored, total
ﬁeld goals scored, single season foul shots scored and total
fouls scored records. . . . Previous records in order were
held by John Centra, 132; Bill Walker, 316; Sig Smith, 94;
and Bill Walker, 236. John Rookwood’s 345 points
makes him the second highest State scorer since 1946.
Standing Room Only

A ﬁnal note on Page (to clear up doubts), the gym is
36 feet wide and 68 feet long. The seating capacity is 800,
which means only 1200 of you will have to stand if Page
is still around next year.

AA Board
Seeks Sport

To the Sports Editor:

With the elimination of Track
from the Varsity scene at State
College, we are left with but one
spring sport—that of baseball.

Within a very short period of
time, Athletic Advisory Board will
begin a study to find a new sport
that will replace Track and Field.

Although the Board at this im-
mediate time ls not ready to delve
into the problem head—on the time
is now ripe for discussion to begin
by those interested in any particu-
lar spring sport. Preliminary plans
will shortly be made to feel out
student opinion and bring the prob-
lem to a head.

If any individual or group wishes
to see any particular spring sport
added to the intercollegiate pro-
gram thc procedure to do so could
perhaps follow a. pattern similar to
this: 1. Begin discussion of the pos-
sibility with those people known to
have shown interest in the sport.

2. Attempt to determine somewhat
the following of participants such a
sport would attract.

3. Acting as :1 unified group £11)-
proach the Board so that they may
listen, discuss and make a recom—
mendation in regards to the find-
liigs.

4. At any time feel free to ours-
Lion mcmbcrs of the Board or sock
their advice on any such matters.

It is only by the interest and lic-
tion of the interested themselves
that AA Board may have any basis
for the recommendation of a new
spring sport.

Peds Finish Season
With RPI Conquest

Six men hit double ﬁgures last Friday
night as the Feds closed the 1956-57 sea-
son in good order by dropping RPI, 89-71.
The win gave the Sauersmen a 17-5 rec-
ord for the year, and a perfect home season
of eleven straight victories.

As was usual during ﬁrst halves, the
Feds took an opening advantage, 6-2. Gary
Holway hit for four of the ﬁrst six points.
However, the Engineers rallied to knot the
count at 20~20 at the 10 minute mark.

an all court press, the RPI
squad hampered the State scoring
for the remainder of the half, and
took a 47-38 advantage at half-time.

State Steps Up

RPI relaxed their press somewhat
in the second half, and the Sauers-
men began to dig into their lead.
After ﬁve minutes. the Feds had
cut the lead to 51-46 and soon after
were just two points down, 56-64.

Before the game was three-quar-
ters gone. Dick Causey hit on a set
shot to put the Teachers in the
lead, 59-58. From this point on, RPI
could never regain their ﬁrst half
edge.

Ten-Minute Spree

State went on a rampage in the
last ten minutes, outscoring the
Trojans. 26-8. Coach Sauers gave
every man a chance to play in the
ﬁnal minutes, as the Engineers could
not cope with the ﬁnal spree.

Gary Holway led the Pads with 26
points, followed by John Rookwood
with 13. and Don Mayer. Jack Mi-
non, Don Beai‘den and Dick Causey
with 10 each. Game scoring honors
went to Rudy Nessel of RPI with 28.

Final For Four

The game was the last for Cap-
tain Jack Milioii, John Rookwood,
Tom Hoppcy. and Joe Anderson. In
his three years of varsity ball, Mi-
iion scored 499 points, Rookwood in
four years had an oven 600, and
Anderson had 376. Tom Hoppey,
who played two years of varsity be-
fore taking tline to serve Uncle Sam,
had 92 points in the last two sea-
sons.

Immediately after the RPI game.
the Pods clccted D011 Mayer and
Dick Cuuscy to serve as Co-Cnp-
Inins next your.

“"5 [ﬁnd Season

Tili' junior varsity ended its sea—
son against the Albany Business
Collch JV on Friday night also.
The Junior Pods completely out-
classed the ABC's, and walked off
with a one-sided victory.

For nu- JV, they ended the sea-
son with a dismal 4-14 record.
