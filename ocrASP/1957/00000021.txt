STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. MARCH 15. 1957

Religious Clubs Slate Party,

UN Forces Occupy Gaza;
Nassar Violates Agreement

By JOHN YAGEE

The Gaza Strip dominates the
news again this week. Since the
Israelis moved out of the Gaza area
and the United Nations Emergency
Forces moved in, the peace that we
had all hoped for in this area has
not come about. President Nasser
violated an understanding between
UN Secretary General Dag Ham-
marskjold and Foreign Minister
Mahmoud Fawzi of Egypt by order-
ing a civil administration into the
Gaza area. This order caused a dip-
lomatic uproar in the UN.

The Question

One of the big questions of the
week is “What will Israel do now?"
The Israelis withdrew from the Gaza
area on the assumption that the
Egyptian forces would not be allow-
ed to return. The Egyptians had
previously used Gaza as a base for
their attacks on Israel and the
Israelis are afraid that they will do
the same thing again.

The world is waiting to see who
makes the first move. Thousands of
Arabs have been demonstrating in
the Gaza area. Israel has charged
that Egypt is using paid rioters to
stir up anti-Israeli feelings. The
UNEF force fired tear gas over the
heads of an angry Arab mob on
Sunday. Egypt has protested to the
UN over the incident.

Red Sea Base

On Wednesday, reliable sources
reported that the United States
has asked Ethiopia for a. military
base on the Red Sea. If the United
States obtained the use of this
base, it would have a. protective cov-
ering to Egypt's southern flank.
When Emperor Haile Selassie was
asked about the possibilities of a
US. base in Ethiopia, he replied,
“Ethiopia desires to collaborate
with the United States but only on
an equal footing.” Many approve
the request providing the United
States agrees to give Ethiopia more
economic and military aid. There
have been reports that even Russia
has gotten into the act by advising
Ethiopia that the US. wants the
base in order to store up atomic and
hydrogen bombs.

The Gaza Strip crisis is far from
being over. Last week, Israel was
hesitant over removing her troops
from the Gaza area. This problem

was solved with the help of the
US. This week, the problem is more
complex. President Nasser of Egypt
has again thrown a monkey-wrench
in the wheel of world peace. He
seems to make a habit of it. He
wasn‘t satisfied with taking over the
Suez Canal. He wasn’t satisfied with
his commando raids on Israel. He
wasn't satisfied when World War
III almost broke out. Now he wants
the Gaza area too.
No Way Out

How long does he think he can
act like a world dictator? .lt is
about time for the United Nations
to camp down on him and hard.
With so many people questioning the
usefulness of the UN, here would
be a good time for the UN to show
its value. It can’t afford to let the
Egyptians assume civil control over
the Gaza area. An agreement was
made and should be maintained.
There is no backing down.

Dear Editors,

Last weekend, Stiitc Collcgc saw
its most successful Stan.- Fair. This
was due to many factors. Chief
among these were the hard work
done by committee incn‘ibcrs, the
enthusiastic support of participating
organizations, on appropriate opcii-
ing show. and the kind patronage of
the school at large.

I'd like to thank all who helped
make State Fair the success it was:
the booster sellers and buyers, my
committee, the concession chairmen,
and all the crowd who came. i'd
also like to thank the faculty for
their cnthusiaun and support. Apa-
thy? What does that word mean?

Council Chooses
Speakers; Hears
C a/endarReport

Student Council convened at 7:15
pm. Monday with Richard
Hinck '58, Vice-President of Stu-
dent Association, presiding in the
absence of Clyde Payne. The agenda
included committee reports, election
of Moving-Up Day speakers, and
discussion of the Social Calendar.

Before the meeting was called to
order, Payne suggested to Council
for their consideration the idea. of
hiring a professional auditor to keep
the class books. He felt that such
a move would insure a uniform and
orderly system of bookkeeping.

In the last twenty minutes of the
meeting, the College Calendar and
suggestions for its centralization
were discussed. A committee out of
Council was set up to see Presi-
dent Coliins to ascertain what cx-
actly can be done to consolidate the
Calendar. The members of the com-
mittee include Suzanne Liberman
and Ronald Alexander, Juniors, and
Lauretta McGuirk '59.
