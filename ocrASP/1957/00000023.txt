STATE COLLEGE NEWS. IF'RIDAY. MARCH 22. 1957

 

 

[From the Tower ..Light of the
State Teuchers' College at Towson,
Maryland, comes the following:

What Is A Teacher?

Teachers come in various degrees
of learning with more than their
share of honesty, tolerance, pity,
love, truthfulness, and homework
assignments. They are located
across the earth in little schools,
medium-sized schools, and in mod-
ernized outhouses. Students hate
them, principals employ them, and
practice teachers ignore them. A
teacher is a dictionary with a roll-
book on her desk, a spelling book
with a pencil in her hair, a history
book with a timeline in her hand.

A teacher has the patience of a
tree (long-suffering), the kindness
of a nun, the strength of a circus
strong-man, the will of a politician,
and the clothes of a beggar.

She likes conventions, bright stu-
dents, holidays, staying in bed late,
Christmas gifts, and summer vaca-
tions. She cares little for grading
papers, scolding delinquents, after-

school hours, her pay check, and

No one else can smile so sweetly
in class one hour and give you a
“D”-slip the next, give you an as-
signment that takes you all night
to do and forget to correct it, or
give you tests upon which are ques—
tions not only polled from space, but
immaterial to the subject.

ed your trip to Europe. All you do is
write 750 words on “Why I Am In-
terested in Making this Trip" due
immediately. It helps to sort of
connect the words, kind of make
an essay out of it, you know how
it's done.

Now to let you down. There are
restrictions. as usual. For instance:
you have to be a male student (well,
that limits it), and (here's the rub)
you have to ﬁnish your Junior or
Sophomore year by June and you
must never have been on probation.
(Don't stop reading, a friend of
yours might get it!)

What do you bring? This time
yourself isn't quite enough. You have
to have special clothes including
dungarces, whites and white hats
like the cadets wear. You'll be told
what else to buy. Just ordinary
things like mattress covers, black
shoes, blankets, overcoats, pillow
cases, things like that.

And ﬁnally, what‘ll you see? After
Albany in sight in itself), there'll
be Dublin, Amsterdam, (of course
it’s not), Bilboa, Genoa, Villcl‘ranche.
and . Hcmpstcad Harbor and
City Island.

There it is. The opportunity of a
lifetime, summer in Europe and still
you‘re learning! Education's getting
easier every day. If you're micr-
ested, contact Dean Hartley NOW!!!

Anyone For
Spring Sports

    
   
 

 

Spring, and a young man’s thoughts turn to thoughts
of sport. We wonder, indoor or outdoor sport? Coach
Sauers has sent his annual call out for baseball candi-
dates but are we going to be satisﬁed with having but one
varsity sport on campus during the spring? No need to
worry about indoor spring sport, minds turn to that also.

AA Board has issued a letter stating that a study to
ﬁnd a new spring sport to replace the short lived track
and ﬁeld issue will begin soon.

Golf, Tennis, Anyone?

The outlook for arranging some other spring Sport
appears to be enlightening. In the fall of last year, AMIA
held a tennis tournament which was rather successful,
though weather hampered the ﬁnal rounds. Tennis being
mainly a spring and summer sport, here’s a deﬁnite op-
portunity for a new addition. Another sport capable of

becoming varsity level is golf.

On campus there are a

number of students who have a high interest in the Ben
Hogan world, so why not put it into use?

If AA Board is going to consider any sport at all, the
interest must come from the student body ﬁrst. In the
past few years, it's been like bleeding a turnip to get a
sport started around the quad. If opportunity is knock-
ing on your doorstep, get out that racket or mashic and

do something about it.

Others Have, Why Not Us?

Buffalo State, Fredonia State and who knows how
many other State Colleges have golf on a varsity level, and
there are tennis teams on the majority of other schools
in the State. Albany State should be included.

This in part was how the Intra-

fore the final games were rolled
yesterday. As the State College News
came rolling off the Hudsmi presses
twenty lG-pound spheres were roll—
ing down the Rice Alleys determin—
ing this yer's IM kegling champs.

Ridge went into the finale looking
towards its ace, Decker Pardce, to
again come through with the big
one. The Gutterdusters again fell
back on a combination 01‘ high spir-
it and fine team play to retain the
position they claimed all year.
Third place SLS, only two games
off the trail, prayed that Dame For-
tune would once again show its face.

In last week‘s action the Potter
Club took in a 68-pin handicap
against the Guttcrdusters but. lost
all four when they failed to field
the necessary three men.

Ridge Over KB

Ridge still shared the top pcrch
with the GD‘s as they downcd the
KB quintet. The unusual feature of
the contest was the appearance oi
a new hero for Ridge, Kcmpton roll-
ing 205 and 528.

In the second division matches the
Vets clung to fifth place behind
APA. Hilltop and the Apaches tied
for the cellar.

Wrestlers Shine In 8 Team
Tourney; Two Place Third "

By DAVE MILLER

The never-say-die grapplers of Coach Joe Garcia’s 7-2-1
squad of the recently completed season added a pair of
third place ﬁnishes to their laurels last weekend at the
West Point Freshman Invitational tourney at West Point.
In both cases a second or ﬁrst place just eluded the grasp
of the luckiess pair of Farrell and Kane as both dropped
close matches in early rounds to put them in a loser’s
bracket. The Ides of March came to haunt previously un-

State Bowlers
Bow 3-] In Low
Scoring Match

The might of the State College
keglers reached a new low this week
as they put on a miserable showing
against a mediocre HVTI team.

About the only bright spot in a
3-1 loss to the Tech men was a
filial game victory, thanks to a 209
single bowled by the old stalwart
Tom Sullivan.

The first encounter would have
gone to the Hudson keglers even if
they had offered the Teachers a
124-pin handicap. Cable's 205, coup-
led with Sip’s 193 effort, spelled
doom for the Feds who were led

in the initial contest by Sullivan's 1,0

172.
Close—But Not Enough

The second game went the same
way. victory wise. Only the stars
changed. For HVTI LaBelle tossed
a 191 tally while Pardee's 180
brought the Statesman to within 15
maples of the win.

Desperate to avert the shutout
Sullivan then came through with
his high 209 score to give the Feds
point No. l for the night. The big
10 frame score gave Tom a 516
triple for the night, as the Fed
quintet looked forward to evening

beaten Tommy Farrell as the Ped
star dropped a match to his Army
adversary, Ed Strassburger, by a
second )erlod pin, after being forc-
ed to move up a class to the 130
pound bracket. This leaves his rec-
ord in the 123 pound class Intact
and also marked his debut in the
130 pound division, where he later
won a consolation by a pin.

Kane Loses One

Charlie Kane, once decisioned for
his only loss of the regular season,
scored a pin before taking it on
the chin in his second match of
the day, also at the hands of Army.
He later won two matches for a
strjong showing in the overall rec-
or .

Two of the heavyweights who
came along on the trip did more
than make ballast in the car as
Joel Smith made a strong showing ”
while John Gremmer gave his two
opponents a strong scrap before
wing.

you know one. The nosy note-

acteristics are empty hands,
a free-loading naiure and a

this character relies on bare

Never has a notebook, filler
