STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. MARCH 22. 1957

Taxes Drain

Pockets Of College Students

By FRANK SWISKEY

The Ides of March, the assassina-
tion of Julius Caesar, statesman,
strength of his country. The Ides of
April, the assassination of John Q.
Public, taxpayer. strength of his
country.

On April 15, Federal and State
income taxes will fall due. These
two assassins plus the “insignifi—
cant?” ones such as real estate, city,
payroll, luxury, etc., are literally
"stabbing" the American taxpayer
in his economical heart; the eco-
nomic heart being his wallet. Since
1950, the tax “rakeoff” has increased
from one out of every four dollars
to one out of every three.

Why the Taxpayer Complains?

John Q. Public has every right to
complain. Here are some of the rea-
sons: 1) the federal tax collector
may not be taking more than in
previous years, but the question is,
“Where the hell is the reduction
heard in every campaign speech for
the last ten years?" 2) The states
are not even waiting until the tax-
payer gets his money but collect
their taxes in advance. (New York
voted a $35 decrease but actually it
will not apply until two years in the
future!) 3) Gasoline taxes have in-
creased. 4) Auto license fees have
gone up. 5) Payroll taxes, personal
property taxes have gone up. 6)
Then there is the problem of the
"friendly man," the tax assessor. He
inspects your place, revalues it, (im-
provements, you know), then comes
the tax bill (raised tax rate. too
bad).

Joe Schmo, Albany State Affected

Many college "students?" read the
papers on this issue and commonly
state “This doesn't affect me, I'm
still a dependent." Our boy, Joe, is
one of these “learned?” individuals.
Joe forgets that he pays ten cents a

pack tax on a $.22 item, or $2.19 in
taxes on a ﬁfth of “pain reliever."
Here are some examples of how
taxes hit our hackneyed, calloused
hero: luxury taxes—fraternity pin,
$20 plus $2 tax, total $22, or better
yet a ring (how sweet?), ring $100
plus $10 tax, total $110. The trouble
is that Joe never sees the tax be-
cause of a little gimmick called “tax
included.” Let’s suppose our little
hero wanders onto a television give-
away show. He hits the $64,000 ques-
tion (hooray, etcll. Too bad fellow.
here comes the fellow in striped
pants. After this rude fellow takes
his cut Joe is still left with $25,000,
less than half. We now conclude our
tale of Joe Schmo, college student
about to embark on a well earned
vacation. He is holding a new $50
suitcase in one chubby little ﬁst as
he, “Whoa! $55 suitcase.” screams
Joe. “Here's the tag, my, my. $55.
you're right, tax included." Well,
Joe, as you were saying, these taxes
don’t affect me, I'm independent."

What Is Being Done

The taxpayer screams and the one
hearing about it is his congressman.
Congress, therefore. is bearing the
hunt of the tax reduction problem.
Everybody agrees taxes should be
cut, but how?

Foreign aid and military spending
v.ill be under ﬁre as well as public
works programs. Federal aid bills
to schools and farmers are already
in trouble with Congress. The one
lush ﬁeld of aid will probably yield
some might? bitter fruit, especially
when election times roll around.
However, the main problem of gov-
ernment spending and its reduction
must be solved if there is to be re-
lief. There is no other alternative!
“Hail Caesar, we who are about to
die salute you."

Council Discusses Possibility
Of Joining State Association

By NANCY RICHARDS

At Student Council meeting this
week different matters pertaining
to the interests of Student Associa-
tion were discussed. Elizabeth Silva,
foreign student from Mexico, was
on hand to observe one of Council's
regular meetings.

Parents’ Day

To all those who helped with the
State College Revue in any way,
thanks are certainly in order, as
this new attempt netted a profit
of $685.37. Council members believe
that the Revue should continue to
be presented on Parents' Day, which
was also acknowledged as a tre-

Group Slates
Latest Actions

Barbara MacDonald '58, acting
Grand Marshal of Campus Com-
mission, has announced the latest
undertakings of the organization.
Bulletin boards with the organiza-
tion name stenciled on will be
presented to the various groups on
campus to be used in Lower Draper.
The above-mentioned will be dis-
tributed by Carmita Siaba ’58.

Miss MacDonald has also an-
nounced that new lampshadcs have
been installed in Draper Lounge
and that the Commons was cleaned
for Parents’ Day. It has been
pointed out that there are 52 seats
and 22 ash—trays in the Commons;
it is hoped that the student body
will co-operate with the Commission
to keep the Commons clean. Smok-
ing is allowed only in the Commons,
Lounge. tumrels and cafeterias.

Beverly Ward ’60 has been named
to the Commission from her class.
The group is badly in need of try—
outs from the classes of '59 and '60.

mendous success. They recommend,
however, that future Parents' Days
should be necessary only for par-
ents of freshmen and held later in
the spring.

Clyde Payne, President, met with
Edwin Adkins, Chairman of the Ed-
ucation Department, to see how stu-
dents could constructively express
their views on the college education
courses. Another meeting is planned
with Education teachers, members
of Myskania, and Seniors who have
done practice teaching. Question—
naires, which have been given to all
such Seniors, should be turned in
today for consideration.

Complaint

The President of the Student As-
soclatlon of Plattsburg State
Teacher's College sent to Payne :1
copy of an article which appeared in
their college newspaper slamming
the hospitality of our students at
home basketball games. It also com-
plains about the gym. bringing in
such features as unmarked exits
lurid only two at that). and the size
of the playing court. Council real-
izes that the only way to get a new
gymnasium is to secure the pass-
ing of the bond issue before the
legislature, as explained in last
week‘s paper. Plans will be discuss-
ed for campaigning by Student
Council.

Teachers' Association

There may be a chance to estab-
lish a chapter of the New York
State Teachers' Association here on
campus. It is possible to send a rep-
resentative to the first meeting of
Students of Education Association
of New York State on April 26 and
27 free of charge.

Miss Silva was asked to comment
on the meeting and stated that she
found it interesting, just as this
whole year has been for her here
at State.

Cottoniai/ Bounces Down Trail
To Attend Annual Dawn Drag

It's unbelievable, but true. Danc-
ing from 5 to 8 am. An hour when
most people if they have any sense
at all are home in bed sleeping.
Apparently, nobody cares about
having sense because everyone goes
to the Down Dance. How on earth
do people ever expect to dance at
ﬁve in the morning when they have
trouble eating at seven? Yet, every—
one goes to the Dawn Dance. Okay,
then let‘s everyone go to the Dawn
Dance this year too.

If you go though, bring carrots.
Carrots are a must because the
theme is the Cottontiiil Cotillion.
Everyone knows that rabbits cat
carrots, and everyone goes to the
Dawn Dance, so bring carrots.

and took refuge behind the Fifth
Aniendinenl. “But I don't want it,”
cried the rabbit, “I'm not interested
in being in any silly old dance."
However, after some very spirited
persuasion, the rabbit was convinced
that he should be interested and
accepted the invitation to personlfy
the theme for the dance. Now
everyone can go to the dance and be
amused at the rabbit's hopping back
