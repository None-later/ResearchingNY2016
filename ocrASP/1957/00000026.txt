STAT! COLLIGI NEWS. FRIDAY. MARCH 29. 1937'

State College Jury At Moot Court Acqui’rs

Council Hears Guest Speaker;
Disapproves Condemned Films

By NANCY RICHARDS

As a guest speaker to Council,
Mark Chesler, Chairman of the
New York State branch of the Na-
tional Student Association and stu-
dent at Cornell, explained the pos-
sible advantages of this organization
to our college. If we join the asso-
ciation, we will be sending repre-
sentatives to meet with those of
other colleges in the state and na-
tion. Together problems may be
solved with the resources of na-
tional offices and a. full-time staff,
including a Student Government in-
forma ion center. Furthermore, the
top people from each school will
gain good leadership training from
conferences which they will attend,
while representing student opinion.
The National Student Association
is America's representative to the
International S t u d e n 1; Congress
which includes almost every country
in the world. Maybe such a step

Council held a long and quite
confusing discussion on whether or
not condenmed films should be al-
lowed under the International Film
Group budget—or whether the films
should be allowed at all. The orig-
inal concern centered about the
film, “The Young and the Damned,"
which was shown this past Thurs-
day by the group. After much wise
and philosophical sputtering, the
members decided to recommend that
no Student Association money be
allotted for condemned films. of
course this means that the group
can still show these films if they so
desire, but must charge admission.
No drain on the wallets of non-
viewers!

Elected by Council for a term of
two years, Arnold Rothstein ’60 will
serve as a camp board replacement.

“Objection overruled."

"For the benefit of the jury, will
you please . . 

For the benefit of those of you
who haven't the slightest idea what
is going on, these are just a few
quotes from a trial . . . a trial of
the Moot Court of Albany Law
School. Approximately 130 State
College students with majors in
Commerce and Social Studies have
been serving as jurors for these
trials.

This is a unique experiment em—
barked upon by the combined efforts
of Albany Law School and State
College. Alfred I. Maleson, Profes-
sor of Albany Law, and Albert C.
Mossln, Associate Professor of Com-
merce, State, are supervising this
program.

What Is A Moot Court?

The Moot Court is a practice court
for Senior law students. Each trial
is .prepared in the form of a prob-
lem. The facts are written down and
exhibits prepared for use as evid—
ence. Parts for the witnesses are
written. each part being assigned
to some particular law student. Two
student “lawyers” are assigned to
the defense and two to the plain—
tiff in a civil case or to represent
the state in a criminal case. These
cases are based on actual decisions
of the courts. Certain facts are
changed, however, and situations set
up. Area lawyers and judges con-
tribute their services as presiding
justices. The trials are held in the

First Dgree Murder

court room of the Albany Law
School.
The trials are arranged in a

manner similar to a tennis tom'na-
ment, with the winning teams (each
consisting of two student. lawycrsi
competing against other winning
teams down to quarter-finals, semi-
finals, and finals. The winners of
the finals compete against finalists
from other law schools in a re—
gional tournament.
Mutually Advantageous

Law school students experience the
psychological spur which comes from
trying their cases before a jury not
consisting of their fellow law stu—
dents as previously done. Experience
as a Juror also serves as a signifi-
cant practical supplemcnt. to class-
room work in business law and for
the subsequent teaching of business
law.
The Verdict

This past Tuesday State students
acquitted Mr. X (name withheld to
protect the anonymous and ficti-
Lions man) of It first degree murder
charge of Hit. and Rim. Again jus-
tice reigns.

Ridge House became the new In-

Thursday and they won the loop

Running second to the Gutter-
dusters for most of the season, the
men from the barracks gradually
worked their way up to a tie with
the frosh congregation. Thursday

it was do or die. Going into the day
tied with the Gutterdusters they
dropped the first match by the
slender margin of 2 pins. Their
only chance then was to win at
least two of the next three points.
The second contest went to the new
champs as they displayed some of
the finest clutch bowling of the
year. The loop leadership again was

Baseball Opener Set As Peds
ReportL For Practice; Nine Return

By DAVE

A turnout of twenty-ﬁve ball-
players, including several freshmen
as well as nine returning lettermen,
greeted Coach Sauers last Monday
as Ped hopefuls began early train-
ing for the 1957 season.

State Keglers End
Year In Third Slot

The State Varsity Club keglers
ended the season on the right foot
Tuesday night as they took three
from Albany Business College. The
wins came much too late however
as the Feds ended the year 20 games
behind a powerful Union quintet
and 12 games behind second place
Siena College.

Despite the 3-1 win the Teachers
have been known to record some-
what higher scores. The hit-and
miss parade this week was headed
by Tom Sullivan who threw a 485
tall; for the night.

Final Standings

Union 55-13 ABC 30-38
Stella 47-21 RPI 21-47
State 35-33 HVTI 17-51

Sullivan ended the season as high
man for the locals as he sported a
168 average. This total was topped
by only four others in the loop.

MILLER

Gaining early inside tracks for
starting berths were the veterans
of last year's campaign who ﬁnish-
ed the season with a 6—8 record.
but there is still plenty of time for
newoomers and freshmen to earn
starting berths for the April 30
opener. This was confirmed by Coach
Sauers who declared that only
hustlers will play on his bail club
as he will not hesitate to tap the
bench for some pep in the inﬁeld.
Pitching Still Weak Spot

The one big headache still faced
by the Fed mentor is his pitching
staﬁ which at the moment is prac-
tically non-existant. Only three of
the ﬁve hurlers from the '56 crusade
are on hand for duty at the present
time and will have to be supple-
mented by unknowns of this season.
The strong hope in the Fed camp
is that the big bat (.346) of Sandy
Bernstein will lead the Fed sluggers
to a higher batting average than
the .250 of last season.

Dugout Dots

Sixteen games have been carded
for the current campaign, including
two doublefiewders the Feds
ﬁnish the season exactly one month
after starting it with a duece
against Union on the home grounds
on Memorial Day . . where. oh
where, are this year's pitchers?

deadlocked but this was to be the
last tie of the year.

With the crown riding on the
final game of the day and the year,
Ridge threw all the power they pos-
sessed at the slipping quintet. The
result was a new high single for
the year (895) and more important
the coveted crown itself.

Pardee, Oblne Star

Behind every team there are al-
ways two or three outstanding stars.
Ridge had five, although Oblne and
Pardee did the bulk of the day's
task with triples of 580 and 547 re-
spectively. Obine's high triple for
the day included a 222 single thrown
at the most opportune time of the
season.

For a defeated Gutterduster team
the outlook was to next year. The
talented group had proven them-
selves champs in their own right
but they became victims of the old
physics law—two bodies cannot oc—
cupy the same space at the same
time. There was only room for one
champ and Ridge was there.

SLS In Third

Three fraternity teams found
themselves in a. battle for third
slot. When the pins were down and
packed away for the next year it
was SLS holding down the third
slot thanks to the single game they
were able to garnish from their
fourth place APA rivals this week.
