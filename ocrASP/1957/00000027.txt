Beck Defies Investigation

By Sen-ate Racket Committee

By JOHN YAGER

Senator John L. McClellan (D-
Ark.) and his investigating com-
mittee on union rackets were openly
deﬁed this week by Dave Beck,
President of the International
Teamsters Union.

Beck's Money Problems

The committee sought to deter-
mine if Beck had taken $322,448
in teamsters’ dues for his own per-
sonal use. Beck appeared before
the committee in Washington Wed-
nesday and openly deﬁed surrender
of his personal records to the Sen-
ate probers. Beck went further
than most balking witnesses had in
the past by invoking the ﬁrst three
articles of the Constitution, the
Fourth and Fifth amendments and
then questioning the committee's
authority.

Beck had the records with him
and still refused to turn them over
to the probers after he had been
served with a subpoena. When one
of the Senators pointed out to Beck
that he was bound by the AFL-CIO
code of ethics which says that union
ofﬁcials who invoke the Fifth
Amendment “have no right to con-
tinue to hold ofﬁce,” Beck replied
“I am only bound by the law of the
international union." Beck also
added that he intended to seek
re-election by the 1,400,000 members
of his unions.

Emergency Meeting

While Beck was appearing before
the investigating committee, Presi-
dent George Meany of the AFL-CIO
called for an emergency meeting
to be held today of the labor or-
ganization's 26-member Executive
Council to consider Beck’s case.

There is a great deal of specula-
tion as to what action the Execu-
tlve Council members may take.
They could remove Beck from his
jobs as an AFL-CIO vice president
and Executive Council member, sus-
pend the Teamsters Union from the
AFL-CIO. or hold their own in-
vestigation and then suspend the

An interesting side note of the
Beck investigation is that former
Senator James Duff of Pennsyl-
venla is the Chief counsel for Beck.
According to Senator McCarthy, Mr.
Duff has not practiced law for over
twenty-ﬁve years. Proceedings have
been hampered by Mr. Duff’s ab-
sence at hearings.

The labor movement has come a
long way in the past twenty years.
We hope that the Senate Com-
mittee will continue to investigate
union ﬁnances. The working man
should ﬁnd out where his hard
earned dollars are going to. The
Executive Council of the AFL-CIO
can do the country a great service
by investigating Beck‘s actions and
taking appropriate action. We hope
they will clean house themselves
and give labor the good name that
it should have.
