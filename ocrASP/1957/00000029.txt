By JAN CHAMPAGNE

In about a. month, a short, black-
haired. swarthy-complected young
man will be coming to State. to
speak at an open English Evening.
It will not be his first time here.
Perhaps the most noticeable thing
a-out him will be the absence of a
Byronic collar or poetic slouch.

College Years

Luke Zilles‘ father was from Cen-
tral America and after his death.
Luke and his brother came to Sche-
nectady to make their home with
their grandmother. College beckon-
ed; Albany State was near: and
Luke entered as an English major.
Although he received some note as
a poet in his freshman year Vlflhtlie
grapevine and the “Statesman. he
was more famous lat least to his
fellow students) il‘or his dancing
prowess. At that time the lower floor
of the library was converted into a
dance floor during the noon hour
and Luke. of Spanish descent, dis-
tinguished himself in thc samba,
conga. and jitter-bug! He left school
while an undergrad for a soyiurn
in the Army; then returned.

As his four years here went on,
he devoted more and more time to
writing, for a time reviewing the

work in poetry. He was a good stu-
dent and hoped to get enough money
to study at a French university. but
instead turned what he saved over

to Anna Kimmcsis, :ilso v.1 State

Jack Dittmf‘l' Along with these two
they have a rookie by the name of

modern look in the outﬁeld along
with the MnntIc-piccc. Tlrcsc addi-
tions should guarantee the Yanks :i

Last But Not Least

The. r‘cnniindcr of the leagues wrll
bc somewhat rearranged this year.
with Detroit acting the part of the

Gala Home Opener Slated As
PedsPlay Host To Dansbury

By DAVE MILLER

Plans for the May third home
opener of the ‘57 edition of Albany's
baseball Pedrt received Ii big boost
this week as a steering committee
for opening day festivities indicated
that one of the biggest sports open—
ers of Albany State‘s history would
also be one of the most spectacular.

The Feds face Darrbury iii a three
o'clock game at Bleecker Stadium
to inaugurate an eight game Ironic
schedule which will culminate with
a doubleheader against Union on
Memorial Day.

Squad Shapes Up

While some were making plans
for the gala opener. Coach Sauers
and his charges were busy in daily
practices at Bleecker where ﬁne
weather aided the inﬁeld drills and
wind sprints, On the rapidly green-
ing outfield turf, Bernstein, Dudley

and Wilson got into shape shagging
long files as the players took their
turns in the batters box. The feel—
ing around the Fed camp this week
was that only an intra-squad scrim-
mage later in the week would de-
termine the starters for the road
opener at Utica on April 30.

Still the biggest problem faced by
Coach Sauers, who guided his
charges to an 8-6 record in his ﬁrst
season last year, is his pitching
staff. The inﬁeld. which has six
returnees from last year, has settled
down into a smooth working unit.
Dugout Dots

Scorecards and programs will be
available at all home games this
year . . . ballots for the most popli-
lar player will be on sale with a
prize going to the winning player
and some lucky fair.
