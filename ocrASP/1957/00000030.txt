Senate Hearings

STATE COLLEGE Minis. FRIDAY. APRIL 5. 1957

Create Serious

Results For Labor Movement

By FRANK SHEPARD

Already the hearings conducted
by the “Senate Select Committee
Activities in the Labor or Manage-
ment Field" in Washington are set-
ting up a chain reaction of rever-
berations. For the past quarter cen-
tury the labor movement in the
United States has been growing in
size and influence without major
political restraints. Despite the pro-
tests of organized labor over the
passage of the Taft-Hartley Act in
1947. the economic and political
growth of the labor movement has
not been materially arrested. During
these past ten years, however. nu-
merous attempts have been made in
several states to restrict organized
labor by passage of legislation called
“right to work laws" by its propo-
nents. However, with the recent ex—
ception of Indiana. these laws have
not yet been passed in the highly
industrialized states. Interested in-
dividuals have speculated whether a
trend was developing in a serious
curb of labor unions.

McCarthy vs. Reuther?

Now apparently the propitious
time has arrived. It can readily be
seen that the action of the Execu-
tive Council of the AFL-CIO was
speedily taken in an attempt to
minimize the effect of Beck's dis-
misal. unfortunate performance be-
fore the McClellan Committee and
the American public. Instead of
adopting the more orthodox defen-
sive attitude toward the actions of
one of its high-ranking officials,
the Union council seized the ball in
suspending him in an attempt to
disassociate the Beck stigma from
the rest of organized labor. Walter
Reuther, Vice-President of the AF L-
CIO and President of the United
Auto Workers was outspoken in his
denunciation of Mr. Beck and Beck
tactics when confronted recently
with this question on a public af-

fairs radio program. And in the
wings. Washington informants say,
hovers the spectre of Senator Mc-
Carthy who is allegedly planning a
case against Mr. Reuther himself.
The thesis of this case is purported
to be charges that Reuther’s UAW
union has spent a great sum of
money to drive a Wisconsin (the
censured senator’s home state) firm
out of business.
Unions In For Trouble

Let us not forget that the official
title of the investigation being con-
ducted by Senator McClellan's bi-
partisan committee contains the
Words. “Improper Activities in the
Labor or Management Fields.
Union officials naturally are waiting
with baited breath for the manage-
ment phase of the investigation to
begin, but it looks as if there will
be enough sensational union affairs
to keep the committee occupied for
several weeks to come, and the union
officials would be well advised to
not hold their breath in the mean-
time.
The Outcome

Some business spokesmen are
hinting that a federal “right to
work" law is due to receive increas-
ing support in the Congress and
may be passed within a year or
ess. If so. such a law would be a
far cry from the restrictions impos-
ed by the Taft-Hartley Act, It is
probable that it would provide for
the rettu'n of the open shop, and if
such should be the case. organized
labor would have suffered its great-
est defeat in over a generation. It
is almost certain that CongreSs will
enact some system of federal audit-
ing of union pension and welfare
funds. In addition, some restrictions
are slated to be placed on the sup-
port of political campaigns by union
funds. How stringent these may be
only time will tell.

Hears Report

By FRANK

Student Council met promptly at
7:15 pm. Wednesday night to dis-
cuss the various items listed on its
agenda.

The question of the Student-Fac-
ulty Relations Coxmnittee was the
first order of business. President
Collins has suggested that the stu-
dents should have a representative
on this Council. It was pointed out
that this body determines the way
in which courses are set up at the
college and other important mat-

State Players

Freida Cohen '58. Vice-President
of Dramatics and Arts Council, an-
nounces the presentation of "She
Stoops to Conquer" by the New
Paltz Players of New Paltz State
Teachers College, Wednesday, at
8:30 p.m., in Page Hall Auditorium.
There will be only one performance
of this play. The play is a satire
concerning social closes, and was
written by Oliver Goldsmith.

“She Stoops to Conquer" is the
second Annual College Invitation
Production sponsored by Dramatics
and Art Council. The purpose of the
guest productions is to make avail-
able to State College students the
excellent performances of the col-
lege and university theatres
throughout New York State and
New England.

Tickets for this performance are
free with student tax cards. If any-
one desires to receive his ticket in
advance. they will be available at
the Dramatics and Art Council
ticket booth which is located in the
lower perister between Draper and
Husted.

ters pertaining to the student body.
Student Council then discussed the
possibility of having a faculty repr
iesentative on Council.

A motion was made and passed
by Council to limit the State Col-
lege Revue Fund to $1500. Clyde
Payne ‘57 will name members to
a committee to decide what should
be done with the money left over
from this year's Revue. Council
suggested that the fund be used to
purchase a hand printing press or
a bus.

Reject NSA Bid

Members of Council do not feel
that the National Student Associa-
tion is worth joining. Furthermore.
no representative will be sent to
the NSA meeting this year. A rec-
onnnendation was made that future
Student Council members neither
join nor send delegates to future
NSA meetings.

Marlene Ackerman ‘59 was ap-
pointed by Payne to represent State
College at the Student Exchange
Education ASSocintion Conference
in New York City. Council approv-
ed the appointment. Miss Acker-
man will attend the conference dur-
ing the week of student elections.
Payne Attends Meeting

A motion was made to send Payne
to the Confederation of the Uni-
versity of the State of New York
conference at Harpur College April
27 and 28. The motion was passed
by Council.

A committee from Myskania which
was investigating the practicality
of publishing a College Songbook
reported that the cost of printing
was far too excessive. It would
have been necessary to contract a
New York City firm to do the work
because of the unusual methods
needed to print both the notes and
the words for the songs.

and through agency

An SA Coordinator . . .

The ofﬁce of SA President has somehow—and per-

haps delibei'ate1y-been reduced to

man denominator. If we are to believe my opponent
and his supporters. the SA President is merely a
coordinator
term I believe—and experience and proven ability are
of little or no value as qualiﬁcation of this ofﬁce.

coordinator—a ‘posltive’

Or A President?
I must take issue with this idea:

Student Association is more than a sounding board
for everyone else's opinions and ideas. He is a leader,
in every sense of the word. and as such must be able

to make his own decisions, and
policies. To do this the President

consider and evaluate the ideas of others, but in the
able to coalesce these

ﬁnal analysis he must be
opinions r.to a single idea or policy.
And to do this requires a working
knowledge of government and its
procedures. In short it requires
e\pericncn-—thc experience of active
mrticiuallon and actual doing. Mere
ooservation of student government
is simply not enough. Experience
is the best teacher!

And yet. the duties of SA Presi—
(icnl are lot ccnﬁned to formulat-
ing and iinplzmenting policy; the
President is also the Chairman of
Student Council. He must guide the
meetings and insure the effective
iunctionmy; of Student Council.
Now. I contend—and most people
in government agree—that it takes
at least from ‘2 a semester to a
full semester before a new council
member is a sure, positive, thought-
fui contr'butol to council. It seems
inconceivable to me that an in-
dividual can be expected to be a
responmble positive President of
Student Association without any
previous (‘xpciiene in student gov-

“This year. under the prodding of Student Council

ing for the spring elections has been ‘opened up’;
most restrictions have been removed and the candi-
dates and their supporters have been given a wide
range of opportunity for electioneering. Up to this
point. the campaign has been, to say the least. most
interesting. The issues of this election—and I mean
real issues, such as ability and experience—have been
ignored and the campaign has seemed to settle—

you before and of necessity. I have had to talk in
general terms. There was a need to be ambiguous
and vague in order to formulate and incorporate our
ideas into a platform that would most effectively
represent the needs and desires of the student body.
vagueness and generalizations has
passed. Let’s get down to “bram tacks."

There are three major areas of consideration re-
lating to our mechanical structure of government.
These include January to January Elections. Senate-
Unlcameral Government—and Myskanla. Other areas
of consideration include student-faculty-Administra-
tion relations,, larger weekends. larger representation
on Social Calendar. and the general consideration of
relating issues to the interests and concerns of as
many individuals and facets of college as possible
in order to maintain and build positiveness, re-
spect. and interest in our Student Government,
among many others. Let's consider these areas one
by one, analyzing the needs and problems presented.
January-January Elections

We have been discussing January-January elec-
tions for several years. we have been promised Jan-
uary-January elections for several years. and yet,
nothing has been done. The need for January-Jan-
nary elections is evident as we recognize that there
is a great increase in the number of Seniors now

bring placed off-campus, that sen-
iors are concerned with their future
including where they will teach, and
what they Will do after they grad-
uate. The need for this change is
also evident by the fact that a great
deal of the work is now being done
by the Juniors. What are some of
the problems to be overcome?
Campaigning before studying for
the finals, (which can be carried on
between Thanksgiving and Christ-
masr and the problem of having an
impressive installation of ofﬁcers
(which may be taken care of by
having an Inaugural Ball, Class
Banquets, and Jazz Concert for a
large. coordinated. impressive week-
end) must be considered.
Senate-Unicameral Government

The need is obvious as we must
have an effective nucleus to do the
work. and an elimination of com-
pulsory Convocation. The right of
referendum, recall, and petition
must not be forfeited as the student
body must have the ﬁnal oppor-
tunity to voice its opinion. How
will this body he represented? Four
cccted Ly each class. the President,
Vice-Presidan and Secretary of
Student Assocuition, six voted at
large, a non-voting faculty member.
“hat should the role of this body
be? It should pass legislation, re—
cognize the mtcrests and abilities of
Student Association by many effec-
iavc commituc appointments. and
provide full rublieity of its decisions
