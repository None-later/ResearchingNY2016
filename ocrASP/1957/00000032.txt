STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. APRIL

Modern Workers Swing

By BILL FRANKONIS

Ah, sweet progress at State Col-
lege. After years of trimming the
grass on Dorm Field in the conven-
tional, old-fashioned method, some
genius with all the foresight and
efficiency of a true citizen of State
has revolutionized grass cutting on
Dorm Field.

The new method, as seen from
the window of the News office, com-
pletely outdoes any method hereto-
fore seen in the agricultural world.
Its uniqueness is realized by even
the youngest of Albany's citizens as
was proven by a member of the
fashionable seven-year-old set who
stood with hands on hips, enthrall-
ed by the amazing system.

This system requires only a steel

rod with an ovoid protuberance at
its lower end which appears to be
about the same size and consistency
as Brubacher Brownies. When these
tools or weapons have been acquired,
approximately 45 people, each with
an instrument, stand around in two
concentric circles. At the word go,
each begins a short, choppy swing
in the general direction of the grass.
After several minutes of this, every-
one moves severai steps to another
uncut section. Before you know it,
Dorm Field stands out as a thing
of beauty with its concentrically cut
grass.

Thus far, there remains only one
drawback to this new method. and
that is, the workers require con—
tinual training and exercise periods.
This consists of each worker stand—
ing with his cutting implement
grasped in both hands, holding it
about waist high. He, or she, then
proceeds to swing from side to side.
The reason for this is to permit
greater freedom of movement in the
cutting process.

The new system has been hailed
by leading gardeners, and promises
to produce future winners of the
Master's Golf Tournament. How

ported that the committee met the
weekend of April 12, 13 and 14 and
wrote a new constitution which will
be presented to Student Association

Council unanimously defeated a
proposal to investigate an appeal
from the Associated Students of
the University of Alaska asking
state students to send a letter to
the United States Congress asking
fer Alaskan statehood.

After discussing the issue with
Evan R. Collins, President of the
Coilege, Benjamin Comi, Financial
Secretary of the College, and Josiah
Phinney, Financial Advisor to Stu-
dent Association, Clyde Payne rec-
ommended to Council that they add
$500 to Student Council budget for
1957-1958 to pay for the services of
u bookkeeper. The money will go to
Student-Faculty Association to help
pay for a bookkeeper who will audit
