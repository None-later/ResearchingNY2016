With Hitting Spree

It was a hitters' holiday in this
week’s opening Intramural softball
action. Scores of 22-7. 31-11, and
25-14 showed without a doubt that
the stickman had it all over the
helpless moundsmen who have just
begun to get the kinks out of their
aching arms.

SLS in One

In the State loop opener the men
of SLS sent 1? men to the plate in
their initial flame and had the
plate denied 15 times. By the time
KB came to bat the effort seemed
useless and the Washington Afenue
contingent wound up on the short
end of a 22-7 count. Jack Ormsbee
and Joe Purcell starred on the hill
for the FISincn with Tom Tread-

Kampf Komments:

 

Young and Foolish

“Spring has sprung and the ﬂowers has riz, I wonder
where the birdies is?" Then calmly wiping his forehead,
he says. “Oh, der dey is.”

Thus it is that the signs of spring have returned once
more. Couples are strolling around the campus, birds
are twirping, Brubacher and Pierce co-eds, vying for the
best spring tan, lounge beautifully on one part of Dorm
Field while the sporting sign of spring, softballs, whistle
through the air and the many sporting enthusiasts crowd
onto the remainder of Dorm Field as though it were Grand
Central Station.

Elsewhere on the softball diamonds of Page Field and
Beverwyck, fourteen AMIA teams have opened the cur-
rent campaign with the usual early spring phenomenal
number of runs and errors which are so much a part of the
openers of the AMIA softball circuit. In the ﬁrst three
games thus far there was an average of 36.3 runs a game.
Football scores such as 22-7 and 29-20 seem to be char-
acteristic of early softball every spring. This year is no
exception.

Improvements Will Come

However, when the teams settle down they produce
some terriﬁc ball games as was witnessed by last year‘s
play-OHS between Potter and SLS. Sooner or later they
will settle down again this year and it will be worth your
while to take in a few exciting ball games. __

An outstanding characteristic of this year’s league
play is the formation of two real battling teams, the
Humps and the Pogos. This year they have combined to
go under the heading of the Hump-Pogos.

So if you’re looking for real color, glamour and the
key to where a man's thoughts turn to in the spring,
come out and witness the action in the AMIA softball
leagues on either Page or Beverwyck. Games are played
on afternoons and evenings as the schedule lists them.
Today it’s the Grads against the 620 Afﬁliates and to—
morrow, Potter meets APA on Page Field.

day pitching chores should Scalzi
