Hinck’ Campaigner Stresses

Ability In Stu

dent Politics

By DONALD DAME

Once again the time has come
for our school elections. For presi-
dent of Student Association, the
most important post to be filled, we
have two candidates. Dick Hinck is
the best qualified man for the job.
Political Experience Stressed

This foregoing opinion is based
on Hinck’s experience in student
government and his ability to per-
form well in student government
activities. He has served as class
president (Sophomore year) and
presently is vice-president of SA.
He is already familiar with many
of the duties he will assume as
President. These are namely: (1)
attending all Student Council meet-
ings and presiding in the President's
absence, (2) presiding over con-
vocations. This opportunity was af-
forded him while our President was
doing his student teaching. During
this period, he aptly demonstrated
his ability to do the job.

Reasons Not To Vote?

Hinck will not lack stout opposi-
tion. I feel that the majority of this
opposition is neither sound nor leg-
itimate. Some people will not vote
for Hinck because he is a member
of a group which has he’d the presi-
dency for quite a while. This rea-
son is shallow and childish. The
presidential candidates cut across
group lines—they run on their own
merits. Look at the candidate ob-
jectively, not at the jacket or pin
he wears. Another reason why Hinck
will lose votes is because people
think that he will become “too
strong a President." This "reason"
doesn't even deserve further com—
ment. I would always hope that our

SA President will hold fast to his
beliefs. I’m sure Hinck will do this.
Is this what they mean by “too
strong a President?"
Remember Who You Are . . .

Hinck will lose votes because some
people dislike him. Why do they
dislike him? Is it because he doesn't
always smile and say hello? This
might be the case. Is it because of
the complete self-confidence which
he possesses: This might be the
case. True, he does abound in self-
coni’idence and he isn’t afraid to
let people know it. More power to
him. To these people I say, “You
don't know him.”
Get In The Know

I have made no mention of Hinck's
platform. To those unfamiliar with
it, I say, orient yourselves to its
main tenets. A well-informed voter
can make a better choice at voting
time. I hope that everyone who is
eligible to vote will exercise his
privilege. See you at the polls!

Tate Supporter Emphasizes
Academic, Social Interests

By JOHN moan

EXPERIENCE! EXPERIENCE!
The campaign question has been
“Does Jack Tate have enough ex-
perience to be SA President?" “Ex-
perience” shouldn‘t be limited to
“political” experience. During the
past few years. government here at
State has been of a political nature.
Has our government really been
successful?

The Revision of Government
Committee discussed the philosophy
of government for our new consti-
tution. This committee agreed that
the new philosophy should include
political, academic, and social as-
pects of college life.

Jack Tate has the experience that
is necessary to carry out the duties
of the SA President. Having served
on the Student-Faculty Committee,
he has gained experience in the
academic aspect of college life. His
work with members of the faculty
cannot be over-estimated. Jack's
work with Junior and Student
Guides has given him valuable ex-
perience in the social aspect of col-
lege life. Jack recognizes the need
for expanding the Guide system in
order to give the incoming freshmen
a better insight into college life.
Jack's work on Election Commission
has given him experience in the
political nature of college life. We
have already seen the interest
shown as a result of Election Com-
mission's open campaign policy.
Jack is a member of the Revision
of Government Committee and
therefore has a thorough knowledge
of the new type of government that
will be proposed. Yes! Jack Tate

important social and academic ex-
perience.

Copies of Jack's platform have
been circulating around the camp-
us for three weeks now. His positive
attitude toward the problems at
State should not be overlooked. Jack
has submitted his proposals for
breeching the student-faculty gap,
the role of Myskania, the new Sen—
ate, academic courses and credits,
bigger weekend events, January to
January elections, and the role of
student government here at State.
Support these proposals by voting
for Tate for SA President.

We shall probably have a new
constitution next year. Let's also
have a President who can best set
up the machinery for carrying out
this new program. A President who
works well with students, faculty,
and administration. A President
who has shown experience, interest,
leadership, and ability. VOTE FOR
JACK TATE!
