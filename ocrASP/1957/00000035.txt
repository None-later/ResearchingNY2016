This And That

With the probable innovation of January

to January elections, many

lights of the present Moving-Up Day pro-
gram will be abolished. This year we saw
the beginnings of a new weekend on our
campus with the advent of Parents’ Day.
We suggest that these two events be in—
corporated into one weekend. This combi-
nation would aﬁord our parents the op-
portunity to see a broader segment of our
college life. Moving-Up Day exercises allow
the participation of all students, the cere-
monies are colorful, and parents would
certainly enjoy the signiﬁcance of the day’s
activities. The weekend, by including tours,
an athletic event, the annual skit, the tra-
ditional sing and dormitory, sorority, and
fraternity functions, would provide an in-
clusive and varied program. This combina-
tion would ensure a large attendance at the
exercises even though the greatest drawing
card be removed. What do you say?

We understand the sun bathei‘s, and the
joys of acquiring a tan. We see the reason
for want of food and drink, but we fail to
understand the necessity of littering Dorm
Field with our papers. Surely, no one en-
joys a leisurely rest with his nose in an
old Coke container and his toes entangled
in a bent up straw. Come on, girls, keep

it clean.

To our departing ofﬁcers we extend our
congratulations for a job well done, and
to those of you who shall take their places
tomorrow we say continue the progress.

traditional beauty that we blind
ourselves to its ugliness. What. for
instance, has spring brought to us
to replace the mottled sheet of ice
that was Washington Park lake?
The answer is pathetic: a stagnant
cesspool of rotting seaweed and
garbage; a. comedy of urchins
bringing half-dead fish through a
curtain of scum; a fence of human
shrubs around the lake seeking the
meditative grandeur of an ocean in
a toilet bowl—this is spring.

In the same anti-climactic man-
ner. the detested swamp lands of
Dorm field and Page field have dis—
torted the calm of spring into
whirling dust bowls of determined
activity.

We waded patiently through win-
ter with the expectation that spring
weather would bring a flowing ec-

I asked a lovely young lady in
the Student Union if she had an
apartment Selected for next year.
She answered that she hoped to
live in the dormitory again next
year, It was then that I realized my
primary function in life; my duty
to my fellow students and the ad-

enlightened about the advantages of
apartments. For brevity‘s sake I
shall list them here:

i. If handled sensibly. they are
far less expensive than downs.

2. Presently. there is freedom
from dormitory restrictions. thus
supplying an experience of inde-
pendeiice.
