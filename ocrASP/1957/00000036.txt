Softball Wins

With the weatherman on their
side all the way the Intramural
League softball players were able to
run through their complete sched-
ule this week.

In the Slate Loop SLS downed the
Hump-Pogos 9-2 as the H-P's were
unable to tag the offerings of Oi'ms-
bee. Dame led the hitting attack
with a double and triple.

In a couple of runaway games
Monday EEP trampled Ridge, 31-15
while the Apaches sailed by Saylcs
by a 20-15 count.

Graves Best

Ron Graves proved to be the hit-
ting star in the bigger win by
gathering four hits. Gugliomonc
and Call beneﬁted by his efforts
whilc Behrens and Stephenson went
nomc wondering what happened to
their big stickinen.

chnson and Youst joined forces
to gather the win in the other
Monday game while Moylan. Oak—
lcnf and Hohn alternated mound
duty for thc Saylesman.

SLS took their second win of the
week Tuesday. despite a poor show-
ing against Saylcs. Purcell got
credit for the 11-10 win while Paul
Sloan was able to tell of his big
home run.
llolwuy Stars—Again

Gary Holwuy began showing his
followers that he's not a “one sport"
:iihlctc as he pitched and hit the
Hump-Pogos to a decisive 31-14 win
over the Apaches. His grand slam
featured a runaway that saw La—
Rochcllc. Kleiiike and Mackic mak-
ing their way around the basepathe
on fourbaggers.

In the Albany loop APA took it
on the chin from Potter Club Sat-
urday afternoon. Backer worked on
the mound for the Club while re.-
ceiving hitting support oil the bats
of Anderson and Rookwood. “Hoot”
Stefano suffered the big loss.

Walton became another combina-
iion pitching—hitting star in the
Vcts 14—8 win over the Summit
players Monday noon. Besides toss—
ing the win he yielded the biggest
wood in the contest as he lost one
foi u HR.

To Host Danbdry Today

By nave

Albany's baseball Peds will take
the field this afternoon in their
1957 home opener after initiating
the season on the road by trouncing
Utica in a 16-11 siugfest on the
latter's wind-swept field.

Teams Get 36 Hits

Going the route in the pitcher's
nightmare were Mario Scalzi of
State who picked up his first win.
and Francolla of Utica who absorb-
ed the loss. The difference was in
Mario‘s clutch pitching and the sup-
port at the plate as his teammates
rocked Fracolla for thnty hits in—
cluding a healthy percentage 01 ex-
tra base knocks. Scalzi gave up six—
teen hits over his nine inning stint.

The Rockville Centre Senior also
picked up a pair of singles to aid
his own cause and plated two runs.
He was never trailing as the Feds
hopped to a 2-0 lead in the first.
