After a week of controversy, the
proposed Student Association Con-
stitution comes to its test today in
a vote of the student body. The new
Myskania will conduct the ballot-
ing in lower Draper Hall from 9
arm. to 4 pm.

(‘ontroversy Rages

Throughout this past week, some
issue was raised as to the effective-
ness of the Amendment clause of
the document Iartlcle 10, as printed
hi last Friday‘s issue of the Newsr
At an open hearing on the constitu-
lion Tuesday evening, John Yager
'59 proposed a substitute clause
which would permit a 5;. “yes'
vote of' the student body to pass
any amendment.

This proposal would have opposed
the Constitution Committee's word—
ing. which also calls for a -':I "yes"

vote, but also adds that this 2:!
must include thirty per cent of Stu-
dent Association.

llearing Poorly Attended

At the hearing Tuesday evening,
which was poorly attended, the
Amendment clause was debated, and
those in opposition to the docu-
ments wording asked for either a
vote on the two proposals today, or
a postponement of voting for an-
other week. Clyde Payne, out going
President of Student Association,
ruled that since Student Associa—
tion, in an authorized convocation,
had voted to vote on the ratifica—
tion of the document today. any
other suggestion would be out of
order.
