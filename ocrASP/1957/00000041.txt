FOR STICKLERS!

We're still shelling out $25 for every Stickler we

accept—and we’re still accepting plenty! But

- if you want to out yourself in, you've got to start
Stickling NOW! Sticklers are simple riddles with two-word
rhyming answers. Both words must have the same number of
syllables. Send your Sticklers (as many as you want—the more
you send, the better your chance of winning!) to Happy-Joe-
Lucky, Box 67A, Mt.Vernon, N.Y. NOW! TODAY! PRONTO!

YOU’VE PROBABLY HEARD of torch songs (music to cry

(music to bye-bye). The Lucky Strike song is music to
buy by: it’s a pretty ditty that’s devoted strictly to Luckies.
Naturally, that makes it a Cheerful Ear/cl! It reminds you
that Luckies are tops and that better taste is the pleasin’
reason. Luckies’ taste comes from fine tobacco——mild, good-
tasting tobacco that’s 'I‘OAS'I‘ED to taste even better. So,
as the jingle says, “Light up 21 Lucky, it’s light-up time!"
You’ll say it’s the best-tasting cigarette you ever smoked!

- SLS, Potter Lead lM Teams; 3M swat

- First Round Play Ends Today

With the continuance of excellent weather, the Intramural softball league
neared completion of the first round with Potter and SLS retaining their first place
positions in their respective leagues. All games here are taken from summary sheets
and are as complete as possible.

On Monday of this week, the Rousers were aroused by Clyde Payne’s feats both
on the mound and at the plate. Clyde exploded on the Summit pitchers for three
home runs lead the Rousers to a 20-11 tally. There were six round
trippcrs in the game altogether. John Cocos and Arnie Rothstein each had one
for the Rousers while Bob Sholtz toured the bases for Summit. Payne went all
the way for the victory and Allen suffered the defeat.

- Potter remained undefeated with
a 29-6 victory over the hapless and
hitless Grads on Monday also.
Bosomworth and Backer took charge
of mound duties for the Pottermen
and limited the Grads to four hits.
The wood for the Pottermen was
supplied mainly by Harry Millett,
Bob Backer and Anderson. All had
one home run, Backer had two
three-buggers and Millett one, and
Millctt connec' d for a double also.

In the State Loop on Monday, the
fast moving undefeated SLS squad
Virtually assured themselves ﬁrst
place by their 12-3 win over the
Apaches. Jack Ormsbee limited
the opposition to four hits as his
tcammates compiled nine. Orinsbcc
aided his own cause with a fouiu
badger. Swenson handled the mound
duties for the Apaches. The game
was close until the sixth inning
when the South Lakcmen opened
up a 5-3 lead with seven runs.
Don Dame hit for the distance in
this seven run frame.
