Job to decide who stays on the raft
and who gets booted. (Bet he kicks
all the guys off.) The second smash
hit is The Tail '1‘ with Randolph
“Sonny Boy" Scott and Maureen
O'Sullivan. The ads inform us its
the story of “The Ramrod off the
Tall T Ranch." Now that tells us a
heck of a lot!

STRAND

The Buster Keaton Story with
Donald O’Conner, Ann Blyth and
Petter Lorre. Donald portrays the
all-time great slapstick comedian.
The picture gets off to a roaringly
funny start and then slows down
to nothing more than exposed cellu-
loid. Also showing is Fear Strikes
Out. “The real life story of the All-
Star baseball player Jimmy Piersail”
(Anthony Perkins) and his cour-
ageous fight against his toughest

DELAWARE

The Barretts of Wimpole Street
with Jennifer Jones, John Gielgud
and Bill Travers (“Wee Geordie").
The life of Elizabeth Barrett Brown-
ing from the book of the same name.
Jennifer plays Elizabeth, a cripple
with a domineering and possessive
father, while Bill Travers portrays
Robert Browning who elopes with
her to Italy where they spend the
rest of their lives writing poetry
for English literature courses.

MADISON

The Robe with Victor Mature. The
story of the soldier who wins the
robe in which Christ was crucified
and the effects of its possession on
the soldier. Also showing is The
Gladiators. Victor “Barbell” Mature
is back again, this time flexing his
biceps while Susan Hayward stands
by enthralled by this exhibition of
physical magnificence. A must for
all beach bullies.

Here’s old-fashioned ﬂavor in the new way to smoke.
The man—size taste of honest tobacco comes full through. The smooth-drawing

Council Discusses Proposed

Loan To New

By FRANK

Last Wednesday evening at 7:30
pm. a joint meeting of the newly-
elected Student Council and the
out-going members came to order.

Clyde Payne explained to the new
members the functions of Council
as a legislative group. Payne urged
that. in carrying out their duties
of office, the new members always
be considerate of their constituents,
Student Association.

Photograph Service

It was announced to Council that
a request for a loan of $750 for
photographic equipment to be used
by a student photography service
to the News and Pedagogue will be
made to SA in Convocation Friday.
This loan would eventially be ab-
sorbed by the budgets of the two
publications because present ex-
penses would be reduced by the
innovation of the proposed photog-
raphy service.

Social Calendar

Suzanne Lieberman ’58 reported
that the rules and procedures for
Social Calendar have been distrib-
uted to organizations wishing dates
for events next year. Most of the
dates have been handed in and
wrok on the calendar will begin
as soon as a new Social Calendar
Chairman has been appointed.

New Film Group?

Steve Jacobson ’59 asked Council
for its opinion on a proposed new
film group here at State. This group
would present new movies—shown
on weekends. The ﬁlms available
are mostly in color and all are
sound pictures. The new group.
which would be independent of
IFG, would be financed for the
first year by a loan from the Big
Four Fund. Jacobson states that
by charging a small admission fee
the loan could be paid back and a
profit realized. On basis of the dis-
cussion which ensued. it appears
that Council is generally in favor of
the new group. After more deﬁnite
plans of organization are made. the
group will come before Council for
its decision.

New Constitution

The next item of discussion was
the new Constitution to be voted
upon by SA in Convocation today.
A change in article 10 was proposed.
However, Payne pointed out that
this section was illegal according to
Robert's Rules of Order. The ﬁnal
outcome of the discussion was that
the constitution wil be voted upon

as it was moved in last weeks’
Convocation.
