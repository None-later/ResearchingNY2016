Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Na-

proved to be adventurous events in
our four-day visit of Paris.

My last stop in Europe was the
French Riviera. We met the Em-
pire State in Ville-France which is
next to the famous resort city of
Nice and a short distance from
Monaco and Monte Carlo.

No where in Europe did the peo-
ple make me feel unwanted or un-
comfortable. I would like to thank
the college for making this trip pos—
sible and wish the upmost success
to the next delegate from Albany.

Frosh SelL
Ear/y Pace
Af Frosh Camp

The so-called verdant frosh proved
themselves right well in their full
participation of sports at Fresh-
man Camp. Finely coordinated ac-
tivities were utilized by the campers
to create a strong spirit and a tight
bond that were apparent for the
entire weekend.

The sports varied from checkers
and chess to football and softball;
and were enacted on the spacious
grounds of Camp Schodack, eight
miles from Etiite.

Competition brings drive; drive
offsprings standouts and highpoints.
Here they are——

Gunderman hurls frosh sofball win

Rebounding from a 1-0 setback on
Saturday, the fresh, led by pitcher
Larry Gunderman, defeated a coni-
bination of counseiers and waiters, on
Sunday, 4—3. Storming from behind,
they scored three times in the fourth
inning to win. The series ended with
each side claiming a victory apiece.

To the right of the softball games;
basketball, tennis, swimming and
diving, football. volleyball and ping-
pong were played enthusiastically.

Upon careful examination of this
list, it appears that this reporter has
omitted the most important of all
sports here at S.T.C. The activity
being, soccer. However, due to the
alert soliciting of varsity player,
Warren Dunham, soccer hopefuls
were scouted. Needless to say, the
report was encouraging.

On a note of complete satisfaction
by all; an interlude neither short or
drawn out, frosh camp ended 3 p.m.,
Sunday.

One may only remark—Beware!
Sophs! The freshman athletes are
coming!

 

 

 

Kampf Komments:

 

Seven,

Come Heven

 

Six and one add up to seven; seven is a lucky number;
therefore, the class of sixty-one should present a winning
combination in this year’s Rivalry. Let’s face it, Sophs,
the class of ’52 turned the trick on the upperclassmen in

their freshman year.

This realization came to this writer as he fioundered
in the pool with all his clothes on up at Men's Frosh Camp
this past weekend. It has been said up to date that_this
year’s crew of Red Devils hasn’t shown as much enthuSIasm
as last year’s Yellow Jackets. We find this feeling to be
primarily false especially in the field of athletics.

Cohen, Bearden Best Bets For Varsity

Coach Sauers has two outstanding varsity basketball
recruits in the persons of Don Cohen from Albany High
and Don Bearden‘s younger brother, Dave. Both of these
boys possess the capabilities to make them varsity mem—
bers come the opening of basketball season.

The soccer squad has be

en increased by some twenty

or more freshmen who are out to boost Coach Garcia‘s

hopes for a winning season.

As far as intramural and Rivalry activities are con-
cerned, one need only make his way to Dorm Field to watch

the Sayles Hall team in its practice sessions.

The class of

’60 isn‘t going to have an easy time of it this year.

AMIA Football Gets Under Way

A bigger and better football season is in store for all
of you who enjoy the rough and tumble sport. The athletes
haven't let the departure of Dorm Field interfere with plans

for the coming league action.

All games will be played on

an enlarged field on Beverwyck Field.
There have been some minor changes made in the
playing area this year, the most important being that the

end zones have been increase

d by five yards. The ﬁeld has

also been widened to give a greater playing area.

Action will get under way on September 30 with about
eight or nine teams participating. Last year’s undefeated
champions, Potter Club, will be out to make it two years
in a row, but they have lost a couple of linemen and pos-
sibly the signal calling of Tom Brierly. SLS has been hurt
by academic failure and transfers, but cannot be counted
out of contention. The forward wall of APA will average
close to two hundred pounds pcr man this year and will
be about the strongest in the league. KB has picked up a
couple of ﬁne additions to their squad of last year and
could loom as the spoiler in league action this season.
Next week we will begin a series of reports on all the teams

in the league.

Will the Humps return to “action” this year?

‘ Open Soccer

Will the factors of experience and
a good early season showing make
up for a tougher schedule and the
loss of seven lettermen? This is the
question in the minds of the Albany
fans this week as the team which
looked good in intrasquad scrim-
mages plays two exhibitions before
initiating the season on Friday of
next week.

Season's Opening

F‘raleigh Dickinson will be the
host in this afternoon fray, marking
the first game for both schools and
the first meeting in soccer between
Albany and F.D.U. The only new
name on the schedule, this New Jer-
sey College should provide one of
the toughest tests the Feds will face.
for they meet Geneseo the follow—
ing week after beating the Western
New York team by a 5-0 score in
last season's opener. Garcia's schol-
ars will then move home to face
Adelphi and avenge a 4-2 loss of
last fall before crossing the Hudson
to RPI whom they defeated in
Bleecker Stadium in 1956.

Lettermen

Significant among the returning
leltermen are Carl Maxson. the All
American honorable mention of 1956.
and Paul Dammer of the New York
State team. The pair will co-captain
a team composed of veteran players
Wendell Fowler, Warren Dunham.
Bob Backer, Eddie Koubeck. and
Lou Delsignore. Delsignore was a
recipient of All State honors in 1956,
when as a Sophomore he played a
back position during the season,
The others were all forwards.

Fowler, whose goal production was
low last season. is coming along very
well in pre~season workouts and
should experience the great season
of which he is capable. Eddie Kou-
beck, plagued by tough luck last
year, along with Bob Backer whose
play should have great impact on
the team. It was Backer who con-
tributed much to the success of the

Clo-Captains of last year's soccer team. Bill Ronsteel and Tito Gugliel-
monc, hand the ball over to Paul Dammer and Carl Maxson, (‘o-Captains
of this year‘s squad.

squad last season when the Garcia—
men took five straight in roaring to
ii 6-3 record, losing a ball game by
a 1-0 score on a freak goal and
dropping one to Panzer and Adel-
phi. Thc varsity was undefeated on
home soil in 1956.

Up from the JV will be Art Hack-
ett. Lee Upcraft, and Gus Tillman.
The trio which shows tremendous
improvement and looked good in
scrimmagcs, will figure in Coach Joc
Garcia‘s long range plans this fall
as the pair of Sophs and the Junior
(Tillmanl will add a scoring punch
in the forward line and a good de-
fense as Gus is in line for the goal-
tending job. He‘ll have a big pair
of shoes to fill in those of departed
Tito Guglielmone, but he appears
to have the stuff to do the job.

Tho freshmen will have ll lot to
say about the hall club’s destiny this
season as the innocents get their

first taste of college soccer. Show-
ing a lot of stuff this week were
war vet John lJackl Jones, Danny
McNeill of Oceanside. New York,
and Middleburgh boy Merle Miller,
just to mention three of many on
the field.
Managers

The athletes this fall will enjoy
the best conditions they have had in
a long while as they will have Chuck
Fowler <‘60I as head manager, as—
sisted by a very able freshman in
the person of Rog Sherman. News
of their feats will go all over the
northeastern part of the country as
the publicity staff has now been
augmented by George McGaughey,
n freshman from Alden, New York.

It looks as if the fans will have a
lot to cheer about this year when the
team returns to face Adelphi on
Saturday, October 12, in the home-
coming game, for this may well be
one of the best squads in Albany
history.
