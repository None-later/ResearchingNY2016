New Teachers' College

The New York State University
has added a new College to its pres-
ent number. The College situated

near Oyster Bay on Long Island is,

designed to prepare teachers of
mathematics and science for second-
ary schools and community colleges.

With an enrollment of fifty-six
women and ninety-two men co‘mpos-
ing the first freshman class, plans
are going into operation for a more
permanent college than the present
one. At present, the campus is lo-
cated on the 409-acre estate of the
late William R. Coe. The perman-
ent location will be at Stony Brook
in Suffolk County.

Compared to the 100 to 1 ratio
of students to faculty in some public
colleges and universities, the ratio
at the new College is 10 to 1.

Like all New York State Teachers
Colleges, there is no tuition charge
to residents of New York State.
Special fees are not expected to

exceed $100 a year. The cost of
housing will range from $180 to $220
