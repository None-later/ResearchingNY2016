FOOTBALL THROUGH THE AGES

The football frenzy is upon us. But let us in the midst
of this pandemonium call time. Let us pause for a moment
of tranquil reflection. What is this great American game
called football? What is its history? Its origins?

First of all, to call football an American game is some-
what misleading. True, the game is now played almost
exclusively in America, but it comes to us from a land
far away and a civilization long dead.

Football was first played in ancient Rome. Introduced
by Julius Caesar, it be'anie one of the most popular
R_oman sports by the time of Nero's reign. The eminent
historian, Sigafoos, reports a crowd of M iVICLDDXVIII
people at the Colosseum one Saturday afternoon to see
the Christians play the Lions.

. With the decline of the Roman empire, football fell
into disuse. The barbaric I-Iuns and Visigoths preferred
canasta. Not until the fifteenth century A. I). (lid foot-
ball emerge from its twilight and rise to its rightful place
in the tirmament of European sports.

Which brings us to September 2t), 1142, a date dear to
the hearts of all football fans. it was on this date, accord—
ing to the eminent historian Sigafoes, that a sixteen-year-
old lad named Christopher Columbus tried out for the
football team at Genoa Tech. He failed to make the team
because he was too light. (He weighed at the time only
twelve pounds.)

And why, you ask, is this date—September 2t), l»l~'i2—
so dear to the hearts of all football fans? Because young
Columbus was so heartbroken at not making the team
that he ran away to sea. And if that hadn’t happened,
he never would have discovered America. And if Columbus
had " discovered America, the world would never have
discovered tobacco. And if the world hadn’t discovered
tobacco, football fans never would have discovered
Marlboro—which, as every fan knows, is the perfect coni-
panion to football. And why shouldn’t it he? Look what
Marlboro’s got . . . lt‘iltcr. . . lt‘lavoi‘ . . . Flip-top Box . . .
You can’t buy a better smoke. You can’t smoke a better
buy.

The end of football in Europe tune with the notorious
“Black Sox Scandal” of 1587, in which lCd Machiavelli,
one of the l’isa mob, paid off the l'niversity of Heidelberg
Sabres to throw the championship game to the ('hnrlrcs
A. and M. (iophers. It was a mortal blow to football on
the continent.

llut the game took hold in the American colonies and
thrived as it had never thrived before. Which brings us
to another date that remains evergreen in the hearts of
football lovers: lleccmber Ill, 1773.

()n that date a lh‘itish packet loaded with ten sailed
into Huston harbor. 'l‘hc colonies had long been smnrting
under the l'lnglish king's tax on ten. “'l‘axntion without
representation," they called it, and feelings run high.

When on December Ill. 1773, the lli'itislt ship docked
at Huston, a semi-pro football team culled the Nonpiu'eil
Tigers, coached by Stuntth th‘wil'ty) .\dnnis, was scrim—
inaging near the harbor. “t ‘oinc. lads," cried Shitty. >t‘t'—
ing the ship. “Let’s dutnp the ten in the occnn !"

With many a laugh and cheer the Nonpnrcil 'l'igcrs
followed Swifty lllltlill'tl :tlul lll'tli't'l .letl to dump the
cargo overboard in a wild, ilisorunnixcd and abandoned
manner. “lit-re now!” called Shifty sharply. "'l‘lntl 's no
way to «lump ten overlmnrd. |.et'.~. get into some kind
of formation.”

And that, fans, is how the ten formation was born.

Kickin' The
Ball Around

 

From the annals of last year’s AMIA football history
comes the story that Potter Club nipped SLS in one of the
closest played contests of the season. When the dust had
cleared and the injured players were swept off the ﬁeld,
the score read Potter Club 14, SLS 12.

Trailing by twelve points at half time, the South Lake
fraternity men, led by Jack Ormsbee, knotted the score
at twelve—all in the ﬁnal period. Then with only a margin
of time remaining, John Benton of Potter broke through
the SL8 line to tag Tom LaRochelle in the end zone for
a safety, giving Potter Club a 14-12 lead and the ball game.

Lost and Found

Both of these teams have lost some of their outstand-
ing players of last year, but both have enough nucleus
left to keep them in contention for this year’s title.

Potter Club, undefeated in league play last year and
holder of the league title, has lost ﬁve first string players

in the persons of Bob Fieri'o,

Ross Daily, Al Tuttle, John

Rookwood, and Joe Anderson. Ficrro was outstanding at
end and was one of the main receivers for quarterback Tom

Brierly.

This year’s captain Harry Mlllett intends to use a
T—formation offense with the emphasis on a running at-
tack. The Potter line has been bolstered by the addition
of Al Jaquays, Al Hayes and Kim Gifford. Lou Call, who
paced the Sayles Hall nine last year, will be a noticeable
addition in the backﬁeld. Whether Brierly’s passes and
quarterbacking can lead the team to another title is un—
answerable now with so many new faces in this year’s

league.
Team ls Lacking

SLS, suﬁ‘ering from the loss of Paul Sloand and idle
Jack Ormsbee, will ﬁeld a team which, according to captain
Bob Sischo, is lacking in many respects. Their offense will
be worked out of a combination T-formation and single
wing. Clark Baker is being tried at quarterback and will
have returning veterans Tom LaRochelle, Randy Dudley
and possibly Tom Treadway in the backﬁeld with him.
Sischo will be stationed at his familiar spot on end and
the line includes heavy, fast charging Bill Gropp and Tom
Buckley. Defensive players to watch are Ron Pryor and
the terror on the line, Toni Treadway.

There you have a rundown on two of the eight teams
in this year's AMIA intramural league. Action opens on
Bevcrwyck on Monday with SLS facing the Ridge squad.

Soccer Squad
Gives Views

This year State is again looking
forward to a promising season on
the soccer ﬁeld. However. before
victory can be insured the team
must have the spirit of the student
body behind it. Let‘s try to stir up
a little interest by taking a look at
some of the guys who will be out
there in the thick of it and see
what some of their feelings are on
the coming season.

Veterans Mainstay of Team

Carl Maxson, remembered as be-
ing voted All—American last year,
will be back at his forward position.
Carl. a senior from 'I‘ruxton. N. Y.,
had four years of soccer and base-
ball and three of basketball at Ti'ux-
ton Central High before coming to
.‘itnte where he has since certainly
proved his worth. Concerning the
coming season he has this to say,
"We have. a rough schedule and
will need all the help we can get
from freshmen. A little more de—
termination should bring an excel-
lent. season." Another senior, Bob
Backer, is familiar to soccer fans
of last year for his outstanding
performance before being injured
near the end of the season. Bob,
who hails from Carle Place, L. 1.,
reports hopefully, “The new fresh—
men will help greatly and we should
have. as good if not a better season
than last year."

Back for his third year this sea—
son is forv.‘ard Wendell Fowler, a
four letter man from Albany High.
“Considering the addition of new
freshmen it should be a good year if
everyone plays tip to his capnbiii~
ties. Full stands would help," states
Wendy.

Among the two year men return-
ing again this season are Lou De
Signorc. named All-State Back last
year. "Del." who came to us from
Watervlict. N. Y., with three years
soccer experience behind hlin also
reports (mtiniisticnlly “We have six
or seven varsity men from inst year
plus a few enthusiastic freshmen. It
should be a better season."
Freshmen Supply Ilope

As we can see from the state-
ments of the players, Conch Garcia
has a few new freshmen who may
hcconit' n determining factor 111 the
success of the season. Outstanding
among these is Merle Miller who
came to State after a hitch in the

bnrgh \lllll three years of booting

validity Glad

Wendell Fowler, President of Var—
sity Club, announced this week that
there Will be a meeting of Varsity
Club on October ll at 7:30 in llru.
A.l members and Varsity athletcs
are Invited

this reporter’s deadline there is
neither a grad student to coach the
team nor enough players to war-
rant a squad. Much of this situa-
tion may be put at the hands of
the student body. That student body
will. or should, hang its head in
shame when the word goes out
that there will be no JV team this
fall-«that a college of two thousand
couldn't even support a JV soccer
team.

Last year's freshman class, and
the class before that, and before
that, provided the nucleus of the
soccer team. Why can‘t this year's
freshmen? What will happen to the
varsity next year when it has no
reserve from which to draw?

Albany is now on the verge of
getting seine of the best facilities in
the State. Within ten years it will
become either one of the sports
powers in the New York State area
or n dead-beat in the sports world.
Which it will be, is up to everyone
of the student body THIS year; for
lack of a JV will soon mean lack of
n varsity.

As you read this, the State varsity
is on its way to F'DU to face one of
its toughest opponents. Looking good
in the ﬁnal scrimmage Wednesday,
which went into overtime before
reaching a decision, the team will
be short two men—~21 freshman, John
Jones. and a Sophomore, Lee Up—
craft. Both are out for an undeter-
mined time with injuries.

The lineup will contain returning
men in the backﬁeld where State is
strongest and at least tw0 on the
line where several freshmen also
show promise. Still doubtful about
the goal. however. Joe Garcia held
off any decision about his goalie un-
til the day of the game.

Bench Bits: Oswego had to cut
from a turnout of 57 soccer play-
ers. . . . Bill Kallusch looked good in
Wednesday‘s scrimmage. Bob
Backer, last year‘s high scorer. is
recovering nicely from injuries and
should play today. . . . Big plans are
under way for the State-Adelphi
Homecoming game, October 12.
