STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. SEPTEMBER 27. 1957

New Ivy League Auto Trends

Amaze State College Reporter Fin

By DAVE GOODMAN

All I was told was that the presi-
dent of GM.. General Motors, was
in town, and he wanted to give
the State College News the scoop
of its career. He was at his summer
home, the State Capitol Building.

As I walked in, he was indulging
in his favorite hobby—puppeteering.
The marionette he was manipulating
bore a startling resemblance to a
certain American president .
even without the golf clubs.

“Son, come 'here," he said, drop-
ping his wooden "ho" “We're com-
ing out with a new car. I was going
to name it Edsela after my wife,
but Ford (cuss 'em) beat me to the
punch.

Instead, I'm going to name it
after my favorite son. Come to my
private garage (the basement of
the Public library) and I'll show
you the all new 1958 Shagnasty.”
Buckle!

And he wasn't kidding, for there
in the depths of the library, 18.2
ft. lower than Page gym) he showed
it to me. “Son, ever see a car like
that? The only Ivy League car ever
made." He was right—J never had
seen a car like that. It was a con-
vertible about the size of an MG
Ma 22 with the striped top fastened
down by three buttons. The tires
were a Brooks Brothers tweed.
“Son,” he continued, “it’s rear en-
gined. The fan be.ts in the back
. . . we even put a buckle on it."
As he talked. I noted which model
it was — a Glee-Jet V-lO. This
prompted me to ask the rated horse-
power. “Son,” he said, “there are
so many horses under the trunk that
you have to feed it strained oats or
it'll run on Sayles coffee or even
salt in a pinch. That was a pun,
son." Ha. Ha.

Charcoal Green

The cab was charcoal green with
superchrome blue-black bumpers.
The hood had a center pleat and
the exhaust ports had dual pipes
with interchangeable bowls. By now
he had the door open and the in-
terior in view. "Notice the width of

the front and rear beds, son —— a
touch of a button, and they become
seats. The speedometer was gauged
to Mach 1. and next to it was en-
graved the name of a nearby in-
expensive morticlan. A twist of a
lever, and two inside windshield
squirts squirted beer. He warned
me that the car was so low that
if one got out too fast, he'd get

. the bends.

Not wanting to extend the inter-
view and risk getting outscooped by
R.P.I., I congratulated the General
and gave the car a good luck thump.
There was an almost inaudible
quiver, like the wind sighing down
Green Street and then, like the
Deacon's Magnificent One Horse
Shay, it collapsed with a groan that
would put Gorgeous George to
shame. I checked my timing, full-
raced out, and heard 220 pounds of
General and twenty-five of various
medals collapse with the car. It’s
too bad he had to get his double-
breasted suit dirty.

Union Board
Elects Officer

William DeGroat '58, Chairman
of Student Union Board, announces
that identification cards must be
used in order to sign out equipment
from the Brubacher office. Also, all
organizations sponsoring functions
in the Student Union must use the
Student Tax Cards to admit stu—
dents.

New Members

Carole Scheu was elected 21 Jun-
ior member of the Board. Kenneth
Kadet ’59 was elected the new Vice-
Chairman of the Board.

Filing Space

There will be a re—allocation of
filing space to organizations. Organ-
izations desiring more space or any
organization not already having
any, may contact DeGroat.

 

Senate OK's Controversial Debate Rule;

The first meeting of the Student
Senate was called to order Wednes-
day evening ln, of all places, the
main dining room at Brubacher
Hall. Student Association President
Richard Hinck. temporarily without
gavel. presided over the historic
meeting.

Strong Rules

Following a brief welcome to the
Senate by Hinck, the industrious
Senators plowed into the first or-
der of business on the agenda—the
approval of the rules under which
they will operate this semester.

David Fothering‘ham '58, Chair-
man of the Committee of Senators
which drew up the rules, explained
their content to the body. Perhaps
the biggest bone of contention was

  

By JOSEPH SZAREK

the now approved Senate rule which
permits only the Senators and of-
ficers of the Senate to speak at
meetings of the body.

Heiwig Shines

Robert Heiwig ’60, urged a mod-
ification in this debate rule. He
stated that at a class meeting held
earlier, the Sophomore Class ex-
pressed dissatisfaction with the rule
which forbids entering into debate
by any student at Senate meetings.
Students may, as the rule now
stands, “address the Senate" by ac-
quiring the consent of the President
of the Student Association. At the
meeting, the connotation was given
to the word “address” to imply that
any non-senator must be prepared
before the Senate is in session if he
wishes to speak.

DEEP IN THOUGHT in the picture above are the Student Associa-

tion Senators. Heads began to bob up a little later in a lively discussion

of the Rules Committee report.

ance Minister Explains Financial Plight .

Roll Call Vote

This is the result of a roll call
vote which passed the controversial
Debate Rule: For—Bosomworth,
Fotheringham, Monteau, Patten,
Santanlcola, Cass. Harris, King,
Lemoine. Cocca, Youngs, Bennett,
Fowler. Penfield, Walther. Those
voting against the rule were—De-
Francis, Monahan, Seymour, Olivo,
Willis. Yager, Cannizzo. Helwig.
Herbst, and Nesbitt.

Financial Mess

The more interesting part of the
meeting was the attempt by Donald
Rice '58, Finance Commissioner, to
acquaint the student legislative
body with the financial difficulties
of Student Association. These are
outlined below:

The assets available to SA have
shrunk from $24,000 to from $3 to 6
thousand. It must be pointed out
that these figures are estimations,
smce the final audit of last year‘s
books is not yet complete. IZi Ex-
penditures for the college camp and
excessive withdrawals from surp.us
are the chief reasons for the sup-
posed shortage.

In vestigation

The finance committee of the
Senate was empowered to begin an
investigation of SA finances.

Hodgepodge

A hodgepodge of committee ap-
pointments were made to investigate
traditions, elections, and finances.
The fate of the sometimes active
Campus Commission will be decid-
cd by the Senate in the near future.

Also in attendance at the initial
meeting of the year were Dorothy
Harper and Richard Esner '59, co-
chairman of the Junior Guide pro-
gram.

Next week, the SA Senators meet
again—in the Government Room?

Judicial Body
Hears Debate
Rule Appeal

At Tuesday evening's Myskania
meeting, the Judicial Body form-
ulated their rules of procedure and
heard a complaint from a member
of the Student Association.

Court Rules

The rules established by the thir-
teen Seniors are to be followed in
all cases of a judicial nature. Lack
of space in this week's issue of the
News does not permit a complete
listing of these rules, but they will
be printed in full next week.

Question of Constitutionality

John Yager '59 appeared before
Myskania and asked for a constitu-
tional ruling on the controversial
debate rule passed by the Student
Senate last Wednesday night. My-
skania presented the charges against
the Senate to that body at this
week's meeting of the group. Fur-
ther information on the Senate's
action may be found elsewhere in
this issue.

The debate rule, passed 15-10 in
the legislature, provides that no
member of SA may enter into de-
bate on the floor of the Senate.
Yager feels that this rule is in direct
opposition to the new Student As-
sociation Constitution passed last
spring by SA.

Homecoming Challenge

At the freshman claSs meeting at
l p.m. today in Page Hall, a repre—
sentative of Myskania will challenge
the freshmen to a "soccer" game to
be played during the halftime of
the annual Homecoming socc er
game.

Registrar Requests
Schedule Changes

The Reistrar, Mrs. Davey, un-
nounces that if uiiy studcnt has u
change lll his schedule he should
report to thc. Registrar. These
changes include the major and
minor fields, dcgrcc sought, or any
other changes sought affecting the
permanent record. The reason for
this is so that changes can be pro-
cesed by the I.B.M. research clerk
in time to be included on a major—
ininor report for faculty li(l\’lS()l‘S.
If the student has not made the
necessary changes on his record

Medical Office

Releases Notice

The following is a message from
Janet. Hood, State College Physician:

"It was understood last year when
the college undertook to give students
their first polio shots free of charge
that students would procure their
third shots from their family physi-
cians sometime in November, 1957,

’l‘hanksgiving weekend would be a
logical time for this, the effect of [he
shot interfering in no way with
gustatory pleasures of the holiday.

It is to be emphasized that it
takes three injections to produce the
full protection that you need against
polio."
