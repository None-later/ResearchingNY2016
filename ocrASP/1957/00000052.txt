Plans Lecture

Barbara Hillinan '59, Publicity Di—
rector for Channing Club announces
that its ﬁrst meeting will be on
Sunday. October 6, at 7:30 pm, 379
Washington Avenue, to discuss the
Ten Commandments.

Minister Speaks

Before the discussion is opened
to the group, the minister of the
First Unitarian Church, James
Madison Barr. will speak briefly on
the premise that the Ten Command-
ments are insufﬁcient as guides to
modern living and are revered more
for their supposed divine origin than
for any reasoned understanding of
the commandments themselves or
the history and background of their
compilation.

match after dropping a close game
one week ago to Farleigh Dickinson
on the Victor's home grounds.

The only Albany score in the 2-1
contest was made by All-American
Carl Maxson. who booted a pass
into the nets at 6:18 of the second
period. This provided a brief lead
for the Peds which was erased When
Jim Brancato slapped in the re-
bound ofI State goalie Gus Tillman
to tie the score. Bill Warring then
turned hero by tallying FDU's win—
ning goal at 12:13 of the third period
on a pass from his wingman, giving
the Maroon and White a lead they
never relinquished. Throughout a
hectic fourth period State put tre-
mendous pressure on the FDU goal.

Changes Mapped

or more importance to the game
to be played tomorrow is the state-
ment issued by Coach Joe Garcia
after last week's game, when he
declared that, “the experiment is
over"---a statement in reference to
the fact that he used only fourteen
players in several combinations—
and later that. "any position is open
to contention'V—taken to mean that
the Fed Mentor, now in his eighth
year. considers no one a sure bet
to make the trip to Gencseo this
afternoon.

(lox At Goal

Elaborating on his statement,
Garcia indicated that he planned
to use Gus Tillman, who played
well in goal Friday, on a line, rc-
placing him in the nets with Dick
Cox. This should add more of a
scoring punch to the line as well
as height, a factor which had a
great deal to do with the outcome
of last week's tiff at FDU. He also
contemplated putting Patti Daminer
in a halfback spot rather than a
fullback position, along with Merle
Miller, a Middleburgh freshman.
Miller played a good game at for-
ward last week but appeared to be
less comfortable on the line than
in the halfback slot to which hc
was ficcustoiilcd.

Bench Mits: Lou Dclsignorc, who
was great last season, looks like he
may cvcn be greater this ycar . . .
Backer played a great. first half . . .
Carl Miixson is living up to his All—
American form.
