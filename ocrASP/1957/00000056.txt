Last week I was informed that a year, they'll change the uniforms

major sports event, the World Series
was about to commence. I hadn't
previously been too interested in
baseball, as my favorite sports were
boys. But at the insistence of a
few of these sports, I decided to
stop studying long enough to watch.
What Made Milwaukee Famous?

My friends were soon identiﬁed as
Brave fans by arming themselves
with what made Milwaukee famous.
Evidentally they take baseball seri-
ously, because as soon as I asked a
few important questions, I was ban-
ished from my living room and had
to go down the street to watch the
Series.

Although I didn't understand the
Series very well, I did manage to
make a few observations.

Not Ivy League

I was disappointed by both team's
uniforms; they weren't Ivy League.
The players didn't wear white bucks
or belts on the backs of their uni-
forms. Maybe with all the changes

too.
Bull Pen

I thought the bull pen would be
closer to the pitcher's mound. In
the third game, by the time the
pitchers reached the mound, they
were too tired to pitch. At least
they Were considerate; they let most
of the players walk instead of run
to first base. By the way, why do
they call it the bull pen? Do the
players sit out there and talk?

Nippy Jones and Casey Stengal
certainly are ladies' men. The way
Nippy polishes his shoes, it even
comes off on a baseball. Did you
see Casey throwing kisses to the
Milwaukee crowd?

I just couldn't understand the hit
and run play. Aren't they all sup-
posed to run after they make a hit?

Sure Cure

There is one thing I did under-
stand though. That was why every-
one objects to the spitbali. With all

that are being made in baseball this the Asiatic Flu that's going around,

Victory  " g
In Sight?  

Having bashed over the forecast for four of the eight
teams in the AMIA touch football league, we turn now to
APA and Sayles Hall who have both appeared in two
games thus far. As far as the records go, APA has a 1-1
record while Sayles Hall has suffered two straight shut out
defeats, the ﬁrst one coming at the hands of the afore-
mentioned APA squad.

Topplcd By Potter Club

In the most exciting and well played game to date,
APA lost sight of league championship for the time being
as Potter Club came from behind to nip them in the last
minute, 18—15. APA is captained by Russ Hall, who ﬁlls
one of the guard positions in a line which weighs an
average of one hundred ninety pounds. Other members
of the line include Tom Sullivan, a hard driving guard
who doubles as the kick off man, Dave Youst, Jim Sourada,
and John Lucas. At the ends, Connie Schmidt and Stan
Davie serve as the ball hawks for the passes of rifle arm
Ron Webb and “Hoot” Stefano who share the number
three and four back spots in the backﬁeld. Tom Thompson
is the ﬁeld general who calls signals and Tom Hoppcy is
the fourth man in the backﬁeld. Besides this offensive
punch, the APA defense is led by Brien Mortensen and
John Burchal. Against Potter, the defensive squad made
three spectacular goal line stands bcfoi'c succumbing to
the EEP drive.

Two Down, Five To Go

Sayles Hall, loser of its ﬁrst two contcsts, is an en-
tirely freshman team quai'tcrbackcd by Steve Mason. In
a close contest against the Ridge Runners, the Saylcsmcn
lost a tough one, 6-0. They have a strong linc lcd by Don
Donato, Joc Bctchc and Dick Baily. Donato is the driver
and is usually in thc opposition‘s buckiicld before they
can get their play oil". 'I‘wo tall frosh share the end posi—
tions. Thcy arc Larry Gundci'man and Frank Bowcn, A
new discovery at end is Don Wilson, who played a sharp
gamc against Ridge.

In the backfield, which plays out of a single wing,
Mason, Ed Whalcn, Jziul I'I'cll'l'ls and spccdy Johnny John—
son arc thc stni'tcrs. Bob Baker is a fifth, who is an adch

State will be looking for an up-
set tomorrow when the Feds face
a strong Ade'phi squad in the an-
nual Homecoming game tomorrow
afternoon at 2 pm. in Bleecker Sta—
They will have to work
mighty hard to get it, for the Feds
will meet a team which is uncle-
feated in its two games this sea-
son (State is winless in its two),
which has scored an average of eight
goals per game (the hapless Pad
line has averaged anal, and which

has beaten the Feds before—slast
year by a 4—2 margin.
The Feds will also attempt to

keep up an unblemished record at
Blecckcr Stadium. where they were
undefeated during the 1956 cam-
paign. They might do it in spite
of the odds against them, for the
Louie fields have aways been more
frici‘dly to the Garciamen; they
also have much more depth now
that a regular JV has been formed
and is holding workouts daily. The
addition of several new players has
meant a great deal to the squad

Programs Released Tonight

Programs giving the expected
lineup will be put on sale this eve-
ning at ’7 p.m.; however, Coach Joe
Garcia has indicated that this is
subject to change if some of the
iess productive ball players who
participated in the tea party at
Geneseo (the men in blue out-
danced the Peds by a 3-1 score)
haven‘t shcwn improvement in the
past week.

It has been largely a six-man
team on the field these last two
weeks. with Lou Delsignore. Bob
Backer, Carl Maxson. Merle Miller,
Paul Damnier, and Bill Kallusch,
but six men aren't enough on the
soccer field. This is large y the rea-
son for the anemic line showing,
but behind the lack of production
of the rest of the players lies lack
of conditioning—due to constantly
interrupted practices due to late
classes.

Bumper Turnout Expected

It will be a close tilt, expected to
draw huge crowds if the weather is
favorable, but the Panthers from
Adelphi still rule favorites to hand
the slumping Peds their third de—
feat in a row.

The game will be preceded by the
Err  B";?ck-".' parade in which

(ic‘I clrss will march behind its
rims banner. The classes will form
hclnnd their banner at 1 pm. in

the Sayles parking lot.

This will kick off the attendance
d'rby for attendance at soccer
games—the winning c ass to be an-
i-ounced after the final game of the
season. Tach person will receive a
class card for this purpose at the
Sayles parking lot at Sayles to be
turned in bv the end of the game
at Bicccksz' Stadium.
