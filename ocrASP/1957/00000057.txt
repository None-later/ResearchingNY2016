Campus Chest Closes
Co-Chairmen Attempt To Top Goal

Again Campus Chest in its annual
drive for funds is seeking contribu-
tions throughout the group houses
and at school. This year the theme.
"Dollars For Diplomas," is being
emphasized because it explains the
whole idea and purpose behind
Campus Chest. Most students realize
that it costs money to get an educa-
tion and so Campus Chest not only
pays for students' education but
also assists those students in vari-
ous ways and lessens their financial

burdens. In other words this organ-
ization helps those who help them-
selves.

Not only in the United States. but
throughout the whole world there
are people who have the abilties
and potentialities for a college edu—
cation but are unable to even con-
sider furthering their education
merely because they can‘t afford it.
Instead they have to go in search
of jobs which offer usually no chal—
lenges to them whereas they might

 

"Dollars For Diplomas'l Drive;

be able to serve their communities
and perhaps nations if only they'd
been able to go to college. Herein
rests the entire purpose of Campus
Chest.

The funds are distributed on a
World-wide basis. The World Uni-
versity Service receives 45"; of the

receipts. It in turn helps students
in countries in Western Europe.
Asia. Africa and South Americz.

WUS gives money for clothing so
that the students may go to classes;
