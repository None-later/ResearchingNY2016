Potter Cops Fourth Straight;
APA Scores; KB Wins First

By JACK LEWIS

Potter Club chalked up another
to their string of victories by romp-
ing over Sayles II. 55-0. on Monday.
The spirited underdogs showed plen-
ty of ﬁght but they still couldn‘t
stop the Potter onslaught.

The high point of the game was
a kick-off return by Lou Call who
ran it back 55 yards for paydirt.
Potter acquired another twelve
points on two 15-yard pass lntercep~
tions by Tom Garno and Bob Bo-
somworth. High scorer in the game
was Harry Millet who carried the
ball across four times. twice on line

3M Spotlight l

Spotlights return to the football
picture this week where the ﬂu was
inable to stop two hearty souls in
the persons of Harry Millett of Pot-
ter Club and “Bump” LaValle of KB.

Four touchdowns were the extent
of Millett's prowess on the gridiron
as he led Potter Club to a 55-0 vic-
tory over Sayles II.

 

Bump Paces KB

KB scored three touchdowns in
winning their ﬁrst game of the year,
and two of them calne through the
pasing of "Bump" LaValle, who
threw two touchdown passes. His
ﬁrst was good for 35 yards. the other
for 40.

plunges and another two on pass in-
terceptions. The ﬁrst of these was
a ﬁve-yard snap from Ron Alexan-
der and the second a 15-yard aerial
from Owen Davis. A ﬁve-yard plunge
by Alexander added on another six
and two safties brought the ﬁnal
score to 55—0 in favor of Potter.

APA Smothers KB

Lacking the passing of Ron Webb
and “Hoot” Stefano seemed to make
little difference to the APA team as
they routed KB, 62-0. last Thurs-
day. At least seven men scored
touchdowns with KB never advanc-
ing beyond APA's 15-yard line in a
completely one-sided game.

KB Wins First

After suffering through two crush-
ing defeats KB made a comeback
on Wednesday when they edged the
Ridge Runners, 20—14, in a well
played game.

In the beginning of the ﬁrst quar-
ter a low snap to Ridge quarterback
Ron Barr bounced out of his hands
to be recovered by KB on the Ruli-
ners' 3-yard line. After an unsec-
3essful line plcnge KB quarterback
Tony Corceila attempted a pass into
the end zone which was deflected
hack into his arms. He proceeded
around the end and over for KB's
ﬁrst touchdown of the season,

Long Passes Spell Victory

The remainder of the game was
highlighted by several successful
aerial attempts by both teams. The
Ridge Runners got rolling in the
second quarter with a 35—yard pass
from Joe Garcia to Ron Barr which
set them up for a scoring end run.
In the same stanza Garcia let go
with another toss to Jerry Bisson
for :1 40-yard scoring play, This put
KB behind. 14—7. at the half.

In the third quarter KB began
its surge to victory. “Bump” LaVallc
passed 40 yards to Mike Levine in
the end zone. A few minutes later.
LaValle repeated his perform'rincc
with a 35-yard aerial which Joe Hill
pulled in. Going into the last quar-
ter it was KB on top. 20—14, and
that was the way it remained.

Tillman Blanks Plartsburgh;
Peds Drop Middlebury Tilt

By I) AVE MILLER

Great play by goalie Gus Tillman was not enough last
Wednesday as the ﬁu—hampered Peds ﬁnally submitted to
a relentless Middlebui'y attack by giving up two second
half goals to drop the game by a 3-1 score on the winner's
turf. The loss, fourth this season for the Feds, came after
a thrilling 1-0 victory over Plattsbui'g in Bleecker stadium
in a rough contest last Saturday, the ﬁrst win this year

after three losses.

SCIENCE MADE SIMPLE: No. 1

Though this column is intended to be a source of inno-
cent mcrriment for all sexes and not to concern itself with
weighty matters, I have asked my sponsors, the makers
of Marlboro, whether I might not, from time to time.
use this space for a short lesson in science. “Makers,” 1
said to them, “might I not, from time to time, use this
space for a short lesson in science?”

They agreed with many a kindly smile, the makcrs of
Marlboro, for they are the most agreeable of men. 'l‘hcir
bcucvolcnce is due in no small measure to thc cigarci 103
they smoke, for Marlboro is a cigarette to soothe the most
snvngc of brciisis. I refer not only to the flavor which. :is
