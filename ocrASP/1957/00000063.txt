Senate Discusses Myskania Office Urges
Letter On College Traditions Registration For

By MARIT JENTOFT-NILSEN

Wednesday evening the Student
Senate meeting opened with an
announcement that Owen Davis '60
had resigned as Senator and that
Patricia DeMember '60 would ﬁll the
vacant Senate seat. It was also an-
nounced that the meeting wasn't
ofﬁcial because the number com-
prising a quorum wasn't present.
Myskania

Marilyn Leach '58 read a letter
from Myskania stating, in effect,
that the body had discussed the
traditions problem and was con-
cerned with what was being done
about the deplorable state of the
situation. Myskania suggested that
upperclassmen as well as the frosh
should be concerned with the lin-
portance of tradition, the handling
of warnings, and that tradition
should be the continuing ideal of
all classes.

It was brought up that ﬁve
Seniors should be appointed to
assume the duties of tradition with
the freshmen class and thus safe-
guard them, and catch them be-
fore they go completely “down the
drain".

Discussion
During the informal meeting Stu-
dent Association President Dick

Kendall stated that President Col-
lins, Dean Hartley, the Cabinet and
he himself would be meeting next
week in order to discuss the situa-
tion and find out what to do to
alleviate it. Also. he and Don Mc-

Conﬁnued...

supervision of the boys in smaller
groups.

At present there are 168 boys in
the school ranging in age from 9 to
18 years. The boys are grouped into
ﬁve divisions, each with its sepa-
rate playground. dining room, wash
room, and dormitory. Each division
is in the charge of a Prefect and a
lay prefect from State College.
Norman Kavanaugh '58 helps Broth-
er Ambrose with the third division
which is the youngest group. Gerald
Biggi '59 assists Brother AZdl'laS
with second division which is the
next oldest. Richard Bissell ‘59 works
with Brother John in the division
called Gibbons Hall. Arthur Lazaro-
witz '60 is helping at present with
Gibbons Hall, but as soon as the
renovations are complete he will be
in charge of a new division under
the direction of Brother Timothy.

All the boys attend school from
9 am. to 3:30 pm. and the curricu-
lum of studies covers the subjects
required bv the University of the
State of New York for elementary
education. An elementary school
staffed bv Brothers is maintained
on tha- propcrtv. The pupils take the
Diocesan and Regents examinations,
and those completing the require-
ments are rent to neighboring high
schools. This is completely in keeping
with the school policy of making the
children a (il‘iilllU' part oi' the com—
munity in which they live.

Clain, he said, were planning to go
to the dorms and talk to the frosh
in order to see what they thought
about the matter and what they
thought could be done about it
not only for this year but for the
future as well.
Points

Various points were set forth as
to what actually might be the cause
of all the trouble. First, it was sug-
gested that upperclassmen were in-
clined to lose interest in rivalry and
traditions as time goes on and that
this year the Sophomores apparent—
ly just don't care. It was generally
agreed that the blame lies with the
upperclassmen. The Asiaian Flu
also received part of the blame
since it caused events to be cati—
celled.
Tax Cards

Finally, Student Tax cards will be
distributed in Lower Draper for
those who don't have them starting
Monday.

Job Placement

Ronald A. Dickson Jr., Teacher
Placement Ofﬁcer, announces that
it is necessary for all students who
are going to graduate in January,
June. or August 1958 to register at
the Teacher Placement Bureau.
This is to be done regardless of
whether or not that student plans
to teach. The Placement Bureau
is in Draper, Room 101.

Register Early

The student is requested to regis—
ter early. By registering early, the
sooner the bureau will be able to
locate employment in the area the
student desires.

Sign Schedule

It is not necessary that the pet'-
sonal data sheets be completed
prior to registration. The important
thing is to register. This means to
sign the schedule in Room 101 in
order to obtain an interview with
the Placement Ofﬁcer.

For a little different twist in POr-
ing we looked into some back issues
of the State College News. The ﬁrst
issue, October 4, 1916, carries an
often - re p e a t e d story—“Largest
Freshman Class in History of the
College." A class of 330 was greeted
with encouraging words. Everyone
was encouraged—there were 60 men
in the class "A good omen."

Another 1916 paper announced
that “we have means in our college
to get into direct communication
with places hundreds, yes. thousands
of miles away.“ We had a wireless
station.

Freshmen who think it's tough
having to wear a beanie should have
been around in 1920. Among other
regulations there were: No freshman
girl may wear her hair down her
back. and, no men of the freshman
class may wear wrist watches or
mustaches.

In 1918 a black - bordered an-
nouncement reported the death of a
former student. Lieutenant Edward
E. Potter. This was done for each of

SPENCER

the State College men who died in
the war.
Freshmen were asking in 1927, too.

“Why is mathematics required of'
freshmen?"
About examinations a former

dean said in the News that it is fool-
ish to review for the entire course;
failure is not a disgrace if one has
done all he can. This would be en-
couraging to hear anytime.

A 1933 edition carried a list of
popular terms of the day. “A babe.
dark horse, muddy plow, oil can,
ice wagon or squaw is a co-ed.“ “A
joker is a Speakeasy. Schnozzy
means extraordinary or amazing."

Reception on Broadway

Arthur Miller's play was well re-
ceived on Broadway by the critics
when it opened in the city. In the
New York Daily News, John Chap-
man acclaimed the play as a classic
and ii modern tragedy.

Chapman called A View from the
Bridge “splendid, stunning theati'e."
and said that it is a “tragedy in the
classic form."

 

The Story of the Play

A View from the Bridge is set in
the waterfront area of New York
City, primarily in Brooklyn. As the
setting is now on the stage of Page
Hall one scene is emphasized over
the others by lighting

There are actually several scenes
present at once but attention is
focused on particular ones while ac-
tion is centered there.

The story concerns Eddie, an
Italian immigrant who has brought
up his wife's niece and is now in
danger of losing her to Rudolpho.
Rudolpho has entered America il-
legally and is thus subject to Eddie's
suspicion.

Eventually Eddie's hatred for Ru-
dolpho and his love for Catherine.
his niece, lead to his own destruc—
tion. Catherine's growing up has
teen too difﬁcult for Eddie to ac-
cept.

A View from the Bridge will be-
gin at 8:30 pm. tonight in Page Hall.
Admission is by Student Tax Card
or one dollar for outsiders.

For the past two wr-cks. the Senate
has been (.iscussing the deplorable
state of traditions, with Hiviili'y as
one of the major phases of it, at
NYSC’l‘. Seniors and Juniors evince
little interest in Rivalry events. and
many other things connected with
tradition. Sophomores are accused,
fairly or unfairly. o1 dcluging Ri-
valry leaders with warnings and
largely ignoring the rest of the
freshmen. McClain read a resolution
by President Kendall to the effect
that. since much of the poor spirit
has been the fault of the upper-
classmen. no freshman Would have
more than three warnings at the
date of the passage of' the resolu-

tion. Student Senate. defeated the
resolution on the grounds that the
freshmen have known the traditions

their Ii‘reshinun Handbook.
