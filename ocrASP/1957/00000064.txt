Dollar Sense .

The ﬁrst reading of the Finance Bill has
not yet been made on the ﬂoor of the Stu-
dent Senate, but we did have a chance to
study its contents earlier this week. In our
opinion, there is one part that must goli

One clause reads: “Within 30 days of the
passage of this bill by the Student Senate,
all organizations receiving funds from the

Student Tax shall have an

shall be a member of the College or a mem-
ber of its Administrative Staff.” Exceptions
to this clause are the Student Senate and

Myskania.

As we understand the workings of the
proposed legislation, an advisor would
check on the ﬁnancial operations of any
organization and nothing more. We do not

favor even this.

As we understand the philosophy of stu-
dent government at this college, the admin-
istration seeks to make State College stu-
dents responsible for their actions, as they

will be in their future lives.

tivity at State College is a student affair,
and rightly so. This newspaper is proud of
the fact that, unlike many other college
publications, it has never had an adviser.
Each of us must learn the true meaning of
responsibility; this is not done by putting

a watchdog on us.

As far as ﬁnances go, we have trust in
people. As far as we know, no organization
has made off with a few thousand dollars,
and neither has any organization which is
properly functioning found any difficulty

in handling its money.

We fail to see the reasoning behind the
clause in the new ﬁnance bill. The word
“advisors” should be a nasty word to any
self-respecting organization on the State

College campus.

sufficient budget will not permit it.
Do you have any idea of the price

GOOD GRIEF

What's with Rivalry this year? The general consensus of opinion
is that it's going to the dogs. The latest development came this week
with a letter to the Sophomore class president—requesting him to with-
draw a warning which was the fourth one given to a particular frosh.
Granted we don't have the power to say if this is wrong or right, but
we are in a position to say that we don‘t feel it's anyone’s power to ask
a Sophomore to withdraw a warning.

This whole business of Rivalry was entered into with very foul atti-
tudes~aiid not just on the part of the Sophs, either. Thanks to the
organizers of the freshman class. the class of '61 leaders never met as a
committee until this week. How could we have expected them to par-
tictpate as an organized group? As for last week‘s convocationuwhat
really is the idea behind the Sophs' attempt to steal the beanies and
why couldn't the fresh cooperate since the beanies were going to be re-
turned to them? What a lot of childplay—and for young adtilts, yct!
Oil! YEAH!

This year's Junior Prom is bringing us one of the greatest bands

event is really poor, More informative posters would really do the triz-k

Sometimes I like to pretend that
I'm Burt Lancaster. Not just be—
cause I look exactly like him, but
because he was the star of “Sweet
Smell of Success," in which he play-
ed an ail-powerful columnist named
J. J. Huntsicker. Now in this flick.
Lancaster had only to mention the
name of seine particular entity
grappling for success, and the entity
would become world-famous over
night.

So pretend that I‘m big Burt. and
that the following entities I mention
will be roaring successes. Actually, I
have only two things to plug this
week, but I figured I‘d work in the
Lancaster bit for the “big-time" ef—
fect. The entities:

1. “A View from the Bridge."

2. Art Show Reception. tD149,
Mon, 4 p.111.) These are the most
worthwhile things of the century.

Remember my column of October
18? That was the one you liked, so
it could only be the one in which I
dragged Albany. The column made
the rounds of the city and fell into
the hands of a few bigwigs. Now
I'm not making any specific claims.
but merely stating an extremely in-
teresting fact: “Escapade,” the mag-
azine i mentioned as one of those
foolishly banned, re-appeared on the
newsstands a few days after the
eighteenth. Now I really feel like
Burt Lancaster. In addition. I met
a nice cop last week.

How about my new little feature
writer? The youth. Dave Goodman,
approached me earlier in the year
and asked me to read some of his
high school work. I read and said,

try and get you in print. Chin up.

A week later, I ﬁgured I'd give

relative oblivion.

Three papers, NYU, Michigan. and
California, reprinted his article.

As of today. the score is 9 to 7 in
favor of the Sophomores, but there
are still 13 points left for one of the
classes to capture. These remaining
points include: 2 for Women’s Soc-
cer, 2 for Men's Football, a combined
cheering point for Soccer and Foot-
ball. 2 for Pushball, l for Pushball
cheering, and 5 for the skit.

Rivalry Leaders

Tomorrow morning the Women's
Soccer and Men's Football games

mores are Herman Altman. Foot-

Traditions ,

If the freshmen lose Rivalry. they
must continue to wear their beanies
until Nortmber 2'7: but if they
should win, the freshmen will not
lzave to wear their beanies from
Campus Day on. For the remainder
of the year, however, the freshmen
must continue to observe all other
State College traditions. Namely.
not cutting campus, entering or
leaving the front doors of Draper or
Richardson Halls, gathering in the
rotunda in front of Minerva, or
wearing high school rings. insignlas
or jackets.

Know Your Songs!

Today is November 1, which means
all the freshmen are required to
know “College of the Empire State,"
"Arm in Arm," and "Life is Very
Different." All right upperclassmen.
let's make sure the fresh know these
songs.
