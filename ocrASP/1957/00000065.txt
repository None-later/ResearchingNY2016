During the past month, the Albany
Institute of History and Art, in
conjunction with a new exhibition
entitled “Microcosm of Albany," has

The models were done by Paul
Schrodt of Albany. Among his
models are the City Court House,
City Hall, Broadway, State Street,
and North Pearl Street. There is
also a miniature reproduction of the
old Dutch Reformed Church of 1715
and the second City Hall, built in
1836.

were exhibited at the New York
World's Fair, and many have recent-
ly been added to the collection.

produced as they are made of old
brick and stone. according to a
special process.

The display of old Albany clim-
axes this Sunday. The Albany Insti-
tute of History and Art is located
one block above the State Educa-

 

tion Building. The exhibit is in the
Lansing Gallery on the second floor,

Clothes Make

The Gnubby

By DAVE GOODMAN

Hungarian college students riot.

Swedish co.lege students try it.

Chinese college students eat Yung
Eg Foo.

What do A.S.C.T. students do?

This epic poem is now answerable.
A once-secret society is growing at
an A-mushrooming rate with its
rolls opened to all. This is the
Gnubby Clubby. Since everyone is
interested, the passwords are:

A Metro Gnome {a citified elf)
Knocks Knats Off Of A Gnu.

The most noticeable quality of a
true gnu .ber is that all clothes look
collegiate on him. He can have wo-
men gaspingr whether he wears a
doub e—bieasted suit or blazer. A
typical gnubber can wear a button—
down, a V-neck ta V-neck is L2 IV)
and chines, and look 10 X better
than an IV-League-clothes-thor—
oughbred with DuPonts of money
who foolishy wears a tab-collared
striped shirt, a rep tie, and a pair
of s XXX! pants with a hand-
sewn buckle in back. and then puts
on a thick-bulky-knit.

The first requirement of being

NO SORRIER WARRIOR exists than the one without
Luckies. What’s be missing? A smoke that’s as light as
they come! End to end, a Lucky is made of superbly light
tobacco—golden rich, wonderfully good-tasting tobacco
that’s toasted to taste even better. That’s a lot to miss out
on—no wonder our chief has grief! Up North, you'd call
him a Blue Sioux; back East, a Bleak Creek. But out in
the land of the pueblo, he’s just a mighty Mopey Hopi.
(Smoke signal to you: Light up 3 Lucky. You‘ll agree a
light smoke’s the right smoke for youi)

gnubby is: Gnubby always dresses
gnuboy but doesn't over-dress or
wear dresses.

The most important demand of
truly gnubby people is that they
worship all things Right. At the
S.U. they put their right foot on
the railing. On the road. they pass
on the right. And when asked to do
anything, they say all Right, tAny-
thing?)

Their enemies are lefties, Leftists.
left—ha foacks, and left-overs. His-
tory records the exploits of many
gnubby men.

. . . In England, pro-gnubby fac—
tions forced Parliament to pass the
Petition of Right.

. . Pythagoras was the end—
gnubbiest. He invented the Right
tiiangle. Now you know why there
is no left triangle.

. . . The wRight bros. were first
to fly.

Its not gnubby to get engaged or
married, because the ring is worn
on the left hand.

Don't go to Paris; it's on the left
bank. So the second requirement is:
You'd rather be Right than Pres.
i-Iey or -idcnti.

The higher echelon of the club
is the gnubility; non-members are
gnubodies.

Lastly. no gnubby-one ever wolf—
whisticd. He speaks softly and car-
ries a wicked paddle. When not
Draw lug. he exudes gnubbiness. His
behavior is above reproach and rc—
pt'oachcd from Above. The third re-
.,uirement is, therefore, Gnubby is

that no gnubbcr is ever caught in

for APA by Joe Hickey, Stan Davies,
Connie Schmidt. Tommy Thompson
and Tom Hoppey.

Potter Tops KB

Potter Club maintained their ull-
defeated record when they held KB
scoreless on Tuesday. Although KB
showed themselves to be much im—
proved thcy were not able to break
the Potter defense and bowed out
22-1). Lou Call scored twice for Pot—
tcr. once when he ran back an in-
tercepted pass and again on a pass
frotii Owen Davis. A two-yard litie
plunge by Harry Millet plus two
suftics brought the ﬁnal score to

SLS Wins

On Wednesday SIS edged out a
19-6 victory over Sayles Hall. After
.t rcoreless first quarter SLS showed
its colors as Ed Veneske intercepted
a Saylcs pass and ran it back 30
yards to the Sayles 10-yard line.
After an unsuccessful pass attempt.
Vcncske got one off to Randy Dud-
ley III the end zone to put SLS
ahead. 6-0, at the half.

In the third period Sayles struck
back as Paul Harris pulled in a 25-
yard throw frotn quarterback Ed
Whalen. Gathering their force, they
sent Will Pawkett through the mid-
dle on a ﬁve-yard plunge, placing
them within scoring distance of the
SL8 goal. On the next play Sayles
hit. paydirt with a short pass from
Whalcn to Larry Gundcrman.

In the remainder of the game the
SL5 acrial attacks proved to be too
iitiiclt for Sayles.

This week the spotlight falls on
Potter Club‘s Lou Call for his truly
outstanding play this season. Being
a deciding factor in most of Potter's
games, Call was again high scorer
against KB on Tuesday. His inter-
ception and riin back was a high
point of the game.

Ed Veneske of SLS again gets the
nod for his excellent play against
Sayles Hall on Wednesday. His pass-
ing and 30-yard run accounted for
all three SLS touchdowns.

Goalie Gus Tillman played a good
game in the nets but did not get the
breaks. offensively or defensively, as
two shots went into the scoring area
on which the Hammondsport Junior
had no chance. This. coupled with
a pair of shots by Tom Fuller that
