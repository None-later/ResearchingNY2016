Smiles Plans Sororities Hold
Youth Events Coffee Hours,

Last evening Smiles held a Hal-
loween party for the children at the
C l i n t o n Square Neighborhood
House. announces Caroline Olivo
’59, Co-ordinator of activities.

Halloween Party

The children saw ghosts and gob-
lins and watched pumpkins turn-
ing into jack-o-lanterns. Among the
stunts and games Were prehistoric
animal races. a trip to the moon, a
horror house, and a costume con-
test. Their fate was predicted by a
gypsy fortune teller. and they were
served cider and doughnuts.

Many Coming Events

This is merely a sample of the
activities that Smiles has planned
101‘ this year. Any persons who are
interested in joining Smiles are
asked to contact either Miss Olivo or
Elizabeth Wager ‘59. the Co-ordin—
ator of activities at the A.bany
Home for Children. This is an ex-
cel.ent opportunity for anyone in-
terested in working with children.

Frosh Meet To
Discuss Skit

Sharon Mosre '59, Class Orgtn-
ier, announces that the freshman
will meet this afternoon at 1 pm.

Rivalry Skit

The meeting will center around
a general discussion of the rivalry
skit which will be presented on
Campus Night. Further considera-
tion will be given to the creation of
a class newspaper.

Deadiine

All freshmen are urged to bring
their handbooks to the meeting so
that the songs which each i‘rosh
must know by today can be sung.
Freshmen are reminded that any
upperclassman who requests than
to sing any of the songs can be
asked by the freshman to sing the
:.ong in return. If the upperclassman
is unable to fulfill this duty he is
unable to hand out a warning.

There is a popular misconception
inching its way through this camp-
us, that I feel should be corrected
before it does any more harm. As
stated by Dick Kendall Friday at
the Sing, Rivalry is a PART OF
TRADITIONS and traditions is not
a part of rivalry. In this paper and
in other areas of articulation at
State, severe criticism has been
leveled at the Sophomore Class.
criticisms which I feel are, in part,
unjust.

1. TRADITIONS: As stated
above, traditions are to be upheld
by every member of the student
body, and not just those who are
participating in Rivalry. It woud
seem logical that the Seniors, who
are about to leave this institution,
should be very concerned with the
enforcement of traditions. since. I
assume, they would like to see them
remain as a part of State College
life thow many Senior "leaders"
have given any warnings?1.

By the same token. just bcraus-
the Class of '59 is the “sister” class

of the freshmen, it does not mean
they should not give warnings to
freshmen for violation of traditions:
in fact. perhaps they should be giv-
ing the most, since. as I envision it.
their job is to see that members of
this class make a reasonable 11d-
justment to State College. and tract-
itions are every bit a part of State
College.

The Sophomores. shoring EQUAL
responsibility with the other classes
for the enforcement of triulttlons.
are also involved in Rivalry. it is
their job to participate in Itivuh‘y
and beat the i'rosh. They aren't
trying to beat them, however, by
giving than many warnings 11nd
taking their ltivnlry participants
out of competition tdvspttv the no—
tit 11 that 11 few people have to the
contraryl.

POPULAR FILTER PRICE

Stuter.“ there were enough “chiefs”
but not enough "Indians." Rivalry.
we are told, is a “big thing” at
State. May 1 ask why the State
College News does not present it as
sueh in its issues? Little insignifi-
cunt "digs" and “comments” are
hardly proper publicity for the ma-
jor affair that it is. A little more
time devoted to Rivalry and a little
less "to little boxes that can think
up their own topic” land say noth-
ing) might. bring out a better re—
sponse, purticipation-wise anyway,
on the port of both the freshmen
11nd the Sophomores.

It is very easy to push the blame
for 11 failure in such a venture as
traditions and Rivalry onto one
group, but why make the Sophomore
Class the. scapegoat? To be a littie
bit trite, but definitely sincere, “this
:‘ollege consists of four 141 '1isses,
.zich of which has a definite and
equal responsibility in seeing that
our traditions, as a means of orien-
tation for the freshmen are perpet-
uated and enforced.
