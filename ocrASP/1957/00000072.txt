Professors have finished de-
termining mid-semester grades
through the usual process of
drawing straws and again stu-
dents are faced with a new crisis.
Are academic endeavors to be
allowed to make inroads on so-
oial,_aotivitles? Obviously no, and
again the problem arises of
how to lessen lessons.

Deve'op a hobby. first and
foremost, that will keep you oc-
cupied while in class (mg. count-
ing coughs. Secondly, study your
teachers. Know the signs which
mean they are about to ask a
question (e.g. pulling at a mus—
tache). Thirdiy, smile apprecia-
tl‘VCIy at al teacher attempts at
joking.

At the end of the next eight
weeks when the new marking
system of pulling names out. of
a but comes into effect, you‘ll
see the progress you've made.

Some folks call it cheating to
use reference books to solve
crossword puzzles. Some of
'us did one last week that
sent us to seven volumes:

wouldn’t be any crossword

the answers. Just imagine a

his library, or an insurance
agent without his actuary

We're in the memory busi-
ness because we sell all kinds
of reference books. There are
important reference volumes
for just about every course.
If we don’t have the one you
want, we are equipped to get
it if it is available anywhere.

Farewell For Six Seniors

The squad lost six Seniors in tltc
game with Panzer, but the fray also
showed some who were coming into
their own on the field. Coach Joe
Garcia had no sooner put Danny
McNeil, on Oceanside, Long island
buy, into the game when the fresh-
man responded with a pair of blis-
tering shots on goal. Davc Frank
turned in some good play as the
season neared its end, as did JV
regular Bob Warn, :1 Nyack prod—
uct, who shows promise if he sticks
with the game.

Lending scorer during the season
was Pnul Dainmer; Frank F‘allacc
had three assists to lead the team in
that department.

Goalie Gus Tillman, who had

morc shols poured on him than he
cares to remember. gets credit for
an average of nine saves per game
and 1.9 misses—man admirable record
but ineffective in terms of a line
that has Very little scoring punch.

HOW TO STUDY

The makers of Marlboro Cigarettes have bought this
space so I can bring a message of importance to American
undergraduates each week. There is no more important
message I can bring you than this: College can be beauti-
ful. Don’t lousc it up with studying.

That was my mistake. At. first, cowcd by college,
I studied so much that I turned into a dreary, |,)li.'iking
creature, subject to dry mouth and night sweats. 'l‘liis
dismal condition prcrailcil iiniil I learned the real mean-
inpr of college. And what is that? I’ll tell you what: to
prcparc you to face the r :iiliiics of the world. And what
do you llt‘t'fl lo hico ihc. ronliiics of the world? I’ll tell you

Of course you have to study, but be poised about it.
Don‘t be likc sonic drones who spend every single night
