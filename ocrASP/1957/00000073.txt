of the Smoker and what we want to
accomplish. So what did we do?

Monday night was a verbal orgy
of smut, with Seniors opening up
their four-year ﬁle of ﬁlth, Juniors
their three-year ﬁle, and so on and
on and on, with enough organized
and rehearsed obscenity to keep the
girls on the second ﬂoor of Bru talk-
ing for a year. For many freshmen
this was a new, thrilling. and shock-
ing experience. What a great kick-
of! to rushing. We put on a ﬂoor
show that would make aParis night-
club donate all its proﬁts to the re-
tired comedians' home.

But for what it was, it was good—-
suitable and plentiful refreshments.
smooth and efﬁcient production,
with few lulls. Why can't we turn
this theatrical ability into some-
thing “ hich can better tell the
freshmen what we think of frater-
nity life, and what we think will

 

 

teneﬁt them. and all the rest of
that unapatheti: stuff?
Some thoughts on next year‘s

Smoker: How about a well-put to-
gether ﬁlm on some of our frat ac-
tivities—the sports, the parties, pic-
nics. work sessions, and such? And
we have the President of each or-
ganirztion narrate the ﬁlm—not so
much from an individual stand—
pcint, but from a "we" meaning
"fraternity" angle.

And another thing. There is talent
in our midst. Through the smoke
and other things we could see that.
Let's exploit it——let‘s put on a real
variety show that is suitable for
rhowing‘ other than behind locked
doors in a smoke-ﬁlled room. lI un—
derstand our proceedings were heard
outside of those same locked doors
anyway.)

This is an opportunity with great
passibilities. This is our Chalice not
only to introduce freshmen to our
organizations, but also for us to use
our imagination and creative ability
as a group. This is a unique oppor-
tunity that can beneﬁt the four fra-
ternities as well as the freshmen.

These are my thoughts on the 1957
cdition of the IFC Smoker.

You've Heard About The All-American Girl;
Here'sThe Other Side Of Story—A State Girl!

By RARY FITZPATRICK

Much has been written on girls.
More has been written about them.
Attempts have been made to class-
ify them by every device known. No
list can be called complete. How-
ever, there are a few basic cate-
gories which college males may find
any day in the Commons.

Collector: All one needs to do to
attract this type is to appear unim-
pressed. It has a shaking effect on
her ego and causes her to begin a
systematic campaign to change your
indifferences to dog-like faithful-
ness. Her favorite pastime is to col-
lect charms for her bracelet. The
charms are in the main, various
and sundry fraternity pins.

Athlete: Unless you are sure of
your prowess in at least eighteen
different sports, do not even try to
approach this type. However, to
those who fall in this category pre-
pare for a hectic courtship. Your
big competition will be her gym
teacher.

Intellectual: Fortunately this is
quite rare in our co lege, but the
pseudo-intellectual is gradually be-
coming more common. The easiest
way to approach this type is to dis-
cover her favor te area of intellec-
tualism l?) and then forget her.

All-American: She has read every
book on how to be the perfect l?)

kiss her, don't say you haven’t been
prepared. After this occurs, you may
begin to see some flaws in her from
then on.

Of course. as you will learn in
Education 21, this does not give you
the true picture of any particular
girl. You must study the whole per-
son, and that's when you'll run into
trouble. So complain but try to do
without them.
