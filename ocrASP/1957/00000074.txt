Rivalry Re-visi’red . . .

State College would be famous if the
ideas of its wonderful “back room” talkers
were ever heard by anyone else besides
other “back room” talkers. Their common
complaint is that nobody wants to hear
their gripes, much less do anything about

them.

Next Wednesday night, in lieu of a Sen-
ate meeting, the critics of the present Ri-
big opportuni-
ty to express their views and to make some

valry program will get their

worthwhile suggestions.
Let’s not waste valuable

over the faux pas of this past semester.
What can and should be done in the future
to prevent a similar situation from reoccur-
ring is the primary objective so that the
Committee will have something more than
"avoid-this—in-the-future” type of sugges-
tion. Let’s hear some concrete ideas on im-
proving the Rivalry system.

There seems to be little doubt
that this year's Rivalry was con-
ducted under circumstances which
were less than favorable. For sev—
eral reasons, including poor organi—
zation, lack of coordination. and in-
effective folIow-through, Rivalry be-
came the object of criticism which
for the most part was justified. Even
when certain mitigating circum-
stances—such as the necessity to
operate under a new and untried
system of Student Government are
considered, it is still quite evident
that the entire Rivalry process was
confusing. uncertain. generally iii-
effective, and in desperate need of
complete revision.

The present Student Government
shares the major part of the blame
for the organizational malfunction.
With this awareness ill mind, the
Senate is attempting to revrse ill-
ttlligently the Rivalry system, so
that this year's performance will not
be repeated next fall. Moreover. both
the Senate and the SA Cabinet feel
that the entire concept of Traditions
at State College is in need of re-
statement.

By RICHARD KENDAL

A meaningful change ill both the
broad area of Traditions and the
speciﬁc area of Rivalry cannot be
achieved by the actions of the Sen-
ate aild Cabinet alone. To initiate a
signiﬁcant and lastlilg pattern of
custom and Rivalry events requires
not only the unilateral decrees of
Student Government, but also the
cooperation and help of the student
body ,who are ultimately the group
which must practice and uphold
Traditions and participate in Ri-
valry. To this end. the Senate has
instructed the President and Vice-
Prcsident of SA to form a commit—
tee which ili turn will hold a hear—
ing to determine what type of pro-
gram for Rivalry Would be illost
efficient and meaningful.

The Committee is being selected
and the llicctiiig has been scheduled
for next Wednesday night ill Bru-
lacher Hall. This hearing will be
(onductczl by the Committee incin-
hers. aild will be a Student Meeting
for the expression of student views.

This is the opportunity to trails-
into those inaiiy criticisms. com-
plaints. aild suggestions into coll-
