Art walked the halls. His thoughts
came through a mist. Silent. Rapid.

Back here a week now. No catch
up on work last turkey. Lazy. No!
Nervous? N00! Sick really. In two
weeks out again. Out outoutout.
Catch up then. Tired. Christmas.
Then will workandworkandwork
during old X-mas. . XXX . . . sealed
with a kiss. Must write loved ones.
Need money. Where did spend all
money. Yes—five dollars the price.
Not worth. That last time. Better
when free. Money scarce. Must write
loved one. no applaud, just $$$.
Urchins. Fifteen cents for shine.
Funny. Have shine stand with elec-
tric lights. Of all the. Hate. Killkill.
No. Can't. Anway, X~mas. Sing.
I’m dreaming of a white goddess,
Just like the one that put
The overalls in Mrs. Murphy‘s
Electric grandmother. With
The tree-tops full of pigeons

 

No Rush

And the children wrapped
Snug in a great big chocolate
Lesson-plan, while visions
Chef-Boy-ar-dee spaghetti
Danced round and round in the
Cochlea and it comes out here, with
All the shavings from all the
beards on all the men that
Grew them for the dead rat.
And the dead is not dead

like the dead dog I saw last
week who bled and bled ’til
dead, who bled and bled ‘til
dead. for he's a jolly good
fellow, which nobody can bleed.
Fifteen men on a dead dog's
Chest. Yo ho ho and a barrel

of fnei‘d.

Good song, White Xmas.
Must remember to forget. Halls
Cold these days. Sickness.

The new ubiquitous sickness.
Buy it today. Sickness tastes
good. Should. Who asked you?

After X—Mas have between semes-
ter vacation. Good. No work. Drink.
Write. Must start writing profes-
sionally. Will write my uncle for
money to start. Can't write. Have ten
rejections already. Write about mor-
bid jokes. Got a match. Joan of Arc?
I‘ll never smile again. Eat my heart
out. Tired. Nervous. Skinny. Must
remember to gamble that three-cent

Explains Directory Delay

By MARIT JENTOFT-‘JILSEN

At Senate meeting Wednesday
night bills were voted upon and
there was a good deal of discussion
on particular items. David Fother-
ingham '58 presented a bi.1 to am-
end finance rules so that final pow-
er would be given to Senate on
appropriations and also that sena-
tors would know exactly what was
being presented to the committee
on fina nc es. All appropriations
would be read on the Senate floor
before going to the committee. The
bill was approved by a slight mar-
gin.

The delay in distributing the
College Directory was explained. It
was announced that the linotype
operator of the printing firm was
incapacitated temporarily but that
the directories should be avaiable
by the end of the week or early this
coming week.

Script Committee reported that
"The Boy Friend“ was the play
chosen to be presented at the State
College Revue next March. The
choice was unanimously approved
by Senate which then decided that
the committee should also select the
director of the production. The
choosing of a co-ordinator will be
left up to the Senate itself, based
upon suggestions of the committee.
it. was pointed out that the director
and co-ordinator should be chosen
before second semester starts so
that they could select the cast and
start rehearsals when classes resume
at that time.

The Cabinet had decided that it
would be advantageous for student
government to have a glass enc.osed
bulletin board. namely the one now
used by the Film Group. Cabinet

Student’s Family

State College student have complet-

had requested that the box be turn-
ed over but the Film Group refused.
Because of this, Cabinet wanted the
Senate to pass legislation requiring
I.F.G. to relinquish the board. The
idea was at first approved but after
reconsidering the proposition before
them and the fact that the college
intended to have the board taken
down anyway the senators voted in
dism15s the case.

The last motion approved was one
concerning the sharing of the cost
of Junior Guides by the three up-
per classes. Both the Sophomore
and Junior classes had voted at class
meetings that they were willing to
do so. but the Senior class stated
that it refused to pay its share. and
so Senate decided to ask thc class
of ‘58 to show why they couldn't pay
or 0 so agree to sharing the cost.

The State (follch News this

there been a lynching threat.

Honduras. Due to a dearth of
transportation facilities (the
surrey drivers were striking for
fringe benefits and the ostrich
teams were struck with Asian
flu) this issue had to be sent in
by carrier pigeon.

However, this one letter of
praise was sent in this week and
deserves some recognition.
“Dear Marie and Joe,
