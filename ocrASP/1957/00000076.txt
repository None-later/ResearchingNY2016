Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Oh, excuse
me! I didn‘t know y0u were reading
me. When I'm alone. I always tap
by myself . . . only I do it the cor-
rect way. Let me introduce myself.
I'm the oldest typewriter in this
newspaper office. Don’t laugh. You
must understand that the News
board has given me special privi-
leges, like typing to myself. They
have too . . . not only because of
my age. but also of the thousands
of words preserved for posterity on
my face. Actually, I know so much
scandal around this place, that they
had to give me special privileges.
Kind of conservative click, you
know!

I'm kind of glad you dropped in

on me-although it was unexpected.
Have a few things I'd like to tell
you about, in a sensational style, of
course! Most of them are recollec-
tions. you understand. but golly, they
were great moments in our history.

I wrote the story when the Com-
mons was opened. Hasn't changed
much, has it? . . . still recall the
tear in the eye of the reporter who
announced that State Greeks were
de-nationalizing . . . the editors who
wrote editorials in 1918. You know,
many of the same problems exist
today._

I hope my ribbon holds out for a
few more years. You've really gone
places in the past few years with
all them new buildings, huge en-
rollments, and new government. By
the way, your new government will
work out all right—take it from
something that knows!

Well. I guess you'd better leave.
Need a week‘s rest before those non-
Business majors come in and tor-
ture me with their scoops from
SUB, D&A. WAA, etc. Still have to
practice my fdsajkl; fdsajkl, fdsajkl.

ANY NORMAL DORM’LL be full of Lucky
smokers! You can count ’em by earloads
on any campus— and no wonder! A
Lucky, you see, is a light smoke—the
right smoke for everyone. It’s made of
nothing but naturally light tobacco . . .
golden rich, wonderfully good-tasting
tobacco that’s toasted to taste even bet-
ter. Find a set of dorms without Lucky
smokers, and you’ve stumbled on a
mighty Odd Quad! Don’t you miss out——
light up a Lucky. You’ll say a light
smoke’s the right smoke for you!
