Peds Drop 3-1 Squad Captains Sauersmen Face Tough Three Game:

Siena Match

Dave Oakleaf's 210 single and

enough for the Fed varsity bowling
squad as the State five lost three
points to a hot Siena team. The
final score was 3-1 as the Feds went
down to defeat by 41 pins.

Oakleaf’s 210 was the season high
for State in a single game as was
Tom Sullivan's triple. Siena's team

Pre-Holiday Schedule This Week

By JACK LEWIS

Tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 the
Fed basketball team will travel to
New Haven State Teachers College
to attempt to avenge last year’s de-
feat on the opponent’s court. If
past experience is any indication
the hoopsters will have a tough game
on their hands and will need all the

amt spew:

State's answer to Don Carter of
world bowling fame turns up in the
sport spotlight this week in the per-
son of "Stretch" Lesnieski. Stretch
found the range on the maples at
the Rice alleys on Wednesday and
scored a season high 234 game in
pacing his SLS team to a 3-1 vic-
tory over the Apaches.

Runner-up spot goes to Dave
Oakleaf and Tom Sullivan, high
single and triplemen for the varsity
team this week.

 

support available. They have started
the season with two successive wins
and will be fighting to retain this
advantage. Coach Sauers will prob-
ably send in his usual starting line-
up consisting of Holway, Causey,
Jack Bearden, Don Mayer, and Don
Bearden, providing the latter recov-
ers fully from his illness of the past
week.

' Oneonta At Home

On Tuesday the Sauersmen will
face Oneonta on the home court.
Despite last year’s close victories
the squad is not without concern
for they will be up against a much
improved team on both offense and
defense. The opposition is reported
to have increased their hustle and
rebounding strength and it should
be a fast. tough game. This will be
followed by the contest with Platts-
burg on Thursday again on the
home floor which will be the third
of seven games to be played by the
Feds.

their second victory last Saturday
night when they faced the New
York State Maritime Academy on
the Page floor. Taking the upper
hand near the beginning of the
game, the Feds romped on to a 51-
27 lead at the half. The fast play

and ball handling of the Maritime

five began to close the gap in the
second half but the Sauersmen were
still able to coast to an 87-75 victory.
High scorer was again Gary Holway
who threw in 28 points before foul-
ing out.
Johnson. Baughan, Pace Team
Holway was aided in the first
half by Dennis Johnson and Tom
Baughan who spearheaded the at-
tack. Johnson accounted for 14
points and Baughan 10 before both
were sent to the sidelines in the
second half, following Holway. The
errors mounted further as Don
Beardcn followed them to the
bench but the early lead proved to
be too much for Maritime as State
clinched the victory.

AA Conference

Twenty-two colleges were repre-

Why not have co-ed intramural

rority-fruternity teams, sports. jil'.ll-
