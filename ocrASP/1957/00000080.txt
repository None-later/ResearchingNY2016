Rivalry:

Suggest Orientation To

By ELIZABETH SPENCER

A meeting to bring out the ideas
of State students concerning Rival-
ry and Traditions was held Wed-
nesday night under the chairman-
ship of David Fotheringham ’58. The
suggestions made will be evaluated
and a general policy formulated by
the committee on Rivalry and Trad-
itlons.

Committee

The meeting was opened with an
introduction of the committee mem-
bers: Folheringham and Al LaFalce
represent the Senior class; from the
class of 1959 are Don Gladstone,
Sally Weeks, and Claudia A'lcock;
the two members from the Sopho-
more class are Bob Helwig and Ian
Ronnla: F—usan James, Donna Steele
and Don Donato from the class of
'61 finish the committee.

Speaking for the freshman class.

that Rivalry should be concentrated
into three weeks with Pushball the
first event because it brings out the
most spirit. Their suggestions also
included stricter enforcement of
rules and participation of all four
classes in estate Co lege Rivalry.
Juniors Versus Seniors

Attention was then focused on the
possibility that organization was
more effective under the leadership
of two Seniors who could devote
more time to the entering class.

It was pointed out that organiza-
tion was somewhat scattered among
the Juniors who were active in other
directions.

Don McClain '59 felt that atten—
tion should not be focused on the
Juniors as much as on the question
to the freshmen: "What did yoti ex-
pect to arrive and see at State Col-
lege that you did not see?”
Orientation Suggested

One of the most concrete sugges-
tions made was that of Marilyn

Leach ’58 to have an orientation pe-
riod required for trash of three days
to get to know one another and to
begin organization, followed by three
weeks concentrated rivalry.
General Suggestions

The meeting then turned to gen-
eral suggestions about the rivalry
itself. What to do about warnings,
beanies, athletic events, enforce-
ment of traditions was discussed
with few conclusions drawn.

Opinions converged a good deal on
the facts that responsibility was due
to spirit. to a conservative attitude,
to lack of first impression of the
importance of traditions. The point
stressed most often was that fresh-
men enter with spirit and are dis-
couraged by the attitude of the up-
perclassmcn. In response to this it
was brought out that the spirit of
the freshmen should be a cause of
interest in future years, not a re-
sult of disinterest in classes ahead
of them.

Matcrialistic things speak for themselves, but it is
those things which you can't measure in dollars and cents
that give a sense of fulﬁllment. It is in the light of such
tradition that we vacate the editorship of the State College
News. The publication of a good newspaper does not “5651?:

free. it comes at the cxpcnsc

of sweat and toil and a good

deal of both. But it is not these things which will remain
with you, it will be those things which the newspaper gives

to you free that you will remember.

It is the lessons of

responsibility, the joy of ucconiplishmcnt, the licartachcs
of opinion, and a scnsc ot' fight that will be yours forever.

Wc have a host of

individuals to

thank for their

generous assistance, guidance, and downright hard work.
To an administration who has been more than helpful on
every occasion, we say thanks. We sincerely appreciate the
patiencc, coopcration, and suggestions our News Board
has given us so unsciﬁshly. Last, but certainly not least,
we say thanks to a staff whose hard work and good judg-
ment has given us a paper of which we are proud. These
are the bands which spend unseen, unheard, and unre-
wardcd hours giving Student Association a good news-
paper. Wc are indeed proud and more than fortunate to
have had the opportunity to work with such people.

To you, Rai'y, we leave our sincere wishes for a most

successful year.
