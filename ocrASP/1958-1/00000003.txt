Feel Lonely? Have Problems? Sororities Plan Senate Favors Counselling;
Gentlemen, Here's Advice Heavy Studying Kendall And Fowler Obiect

Did the most popular girl in your
class recently invite you to her
apartment for a party—as a chap—
erone Hmmm? Do you answer your
mother’s questions about your spec-
ial problems with girls by debonafr-
1y removing the thumb from your
mouth and countering, “What me
worry?" Well. stop eating your
heart out, men, we’re here to help
you. Yes. you there. sitting in the
punch bowl.

What you obviously need is a
standardized guide on the art of
getting along with the tender gen-
der. By a truly remarkable coincid-
ence just such a manuscript is now
being compiled by a board of ex-
perts consisting of Arthur Miller,
Tommy (This time it’s the real
thing.) Manville, Gene Cassidy.
and Art Plotltik. The following is a
quote by one of these experts on
understanding what a girl means
when she says something.

“1. She says: Golly, but you're
bright. I just love intelligent men.
Everyone is talking about you. She
means: Hurry up with my history
term paper so you can start on my
English theme.

2. She says: Boy, this car of yours
is gorgeous! And you drive so well
too! I'll bet you're the safest driver
in Albany. She means: After you
drive me to Bru. you can pick up
my clothes at. the cleaners, and
then come back and drive me home.

3. She says: You know what I
Iike about you? Ycu‘re so discrim-
inating in your choice of girls. You
realize that beauty is only skin
deep, and that personality is so
much more important. She means:
My cousin is coming to visit me
this weekend. She has a face like
Frankenstein, a figure like Moby
Dick, and a personality like Madame

For The Week

Sororities seem to be planning on
some heavy cramming in the coming
week in the light of the activities
they have scheduled.

Beta Zeta

Beta Zeta is holding a coffee hour
for the men who served as waiters
for their formal dinner, according
to Arlene Slusarz '58, Vice-President.
The coffee hour will be held Mon-
day at 8:15 pm.

Gamma Kappa Phi is also holding
a waiter party Sunday from 5 to 8

Chairman of the affair.
Chi Sigma Theta

Patricia Corcoran  President
of Chi Sigma Theta. announces that
Winifred Youngs '59 has been elect-

ed Vice-President of the sorority in
a replacement election.

MEMO TO MAESTROS: is your band dawdling instead of
tootling? Is it full of feeble ﬁfers and drooping drummers?

By earn

The Wednesday night meeting of
student Senate was held to deter-
mine the opinion of Senators con-
cerning a policy of religious coun-
selling withln the college at the re-
quest of President Collins.

Collins’ Opinion

The opinion of President Collins
was summed up by Senate Presi-
dent Richard Kendall: Students
should be entitled to all facets of
education; new ideas presented in
college may upset students' religious
views and they are entitled to coun-
sel; as future teachers State stu-
dents should have a baianced edu-
cation. The point was also made
that any space .provided will be for
student use and religious directors
may visit them there.

Religious Council

A vote taken previously by Reli-
gious Council showed two oppos-
ing organizations, one neutral and
the remaining six in favor.

It was pointed out that the ad-
visor to Hillel is opposed to the

( 355 PARAG

Well, this musical slowdown may be traceable to lack of
Luckies. Better give your band a break—and make it. a
Lucky one! A Lucky, you see, is a light smoke—«the right
smoke for everyone. It’s all cigarette—all naturally light,
wonderfully good-tasting tobacco. And Luckies’ fine to-
bacco is toasted to taste even better. Now then, what’s a

marching band that never gets at Lucky break? Why, it’s
a Sore Corps! (Wasn’t that cymbal?)

move and would not use the space
provided.

Arrangements will be made for
rotation oi Protestant ministers
with a different denomination each
week.

Senate Opinion

The general feeling of the Sen-
ators toward such a move seemed to
be favorable. This was based on
the facts that counselling wou‘d be
by students‘ choice and would not
be harmful to any who did not seek
it. it would be a convenience to
the students, such space is provided
in some other State colleges.

A brief prepared by Charles Fow-
ler ‘60 and the voiced opinion of
Kendall were the only differing
ideas. Fowler’s objections are pri-
marily on the basis that there would
be religious instructions to students
if counseliors were present; Ken-
dall felt that the school as an in—
stitution should be an entity and
that the purpose of the school is to
stimulate thought.

F0 lowing this comparatively mill—
or business. Kendall announced the
more pressing issue of the evening.
According to the new constitution,
which was drawn up last spring for
a l'C-Vli‘dlllﬂﬂtitill of student govern-
ment. all candidatcs for the Presi-
dency and Vice-Presidency must
have a cumulative average of 2.5
at clrviion time. Stating t1:-.r.t bc
had spoken to some administration
lit-ads, Kendall said that it was
generally felt that it would be best
not to entirely remove the "2.5
clause" but rather to alter it to
l’f’iifl 32'). This would cnablc candi—
dates who were interested in sin-
dcnt government and capziblc in
this f.c d to run for of'iiccs in tbs
prcsiii. coining election as well us
bring an advantage to any f'uturc
candilates in any future elections.

Raeburn's Orchestra

Almost twenty years ago in Chi-
cago Boyd Raeburn started his ca-
reer as a bandleader when he form—
ed his first band while a student
at college. Within a short while he
became widely recognized through-
put the entire midwest for the style
of dance music he played.

Raeburn began paying melodic
dance music and was commercially
successful. However. he soon switch-
ed to progressive music; during this
time one of his featured vocalists
was June Clll‘isty who has sung
with Stan Kenton and on records.

Be;ause his progressive music was
less successful Raeburn reverted to
his melodic style and has kept that
smce.

Now singing with the orchestra is
Ginny Powell, one of America's
leading band vocalists.
