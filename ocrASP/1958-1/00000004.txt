Monday, many of the freshman men will be asked to
join one or more of the four fraternities on campus. So
often at this time the emphasis is placed upon the fresh-
men and the impotence of their decision. But it is to the
present fraternity members that we direct the following
questions and criticisms. They are the ones who may
give or deny a bid to any freshman.

It is unfortunate that in the past the stress in fra-
ternity bidding has been placed upon increasing the quan-
tity of future members. The quality of these same mem—
bers-to-be is left up to the wise gods who watch over such
fraternity matters. Why is the “trading” of bids still in
practice even if fraternity members like to deny its exist—
ence? May we quote a popular saying around here: “He’s
not my friend; he’s a fraternity brother.”

We believe strongly in the values of fraternity life.
Many of the experiences in social education and the crea-
tion of mature attitudes toward social relationships are
taught in the informal associations of fraternity life. But
we ask fraternity members to be as discriminating as the
freshmen. We ask both to consider what a fraternity can
do for an individual and what the individual can do for
the fraternity. Don’t give out bids simply to ﬁll the ranks,
and possibly fraternities will return to a dominant position
in the college.

What, Me Study ?

Four Senators had the power Wednesday night to de-
cide whether or not there would be more than one qualiﬁed
candidate running for the ofﬁce of President of Student
Association. These four Senators felt that the issue should
not be left up to SA, and voted down the proposed amend-
ment to change the academic requirement for presidential
candidates. There were twenty-four legislators present at
the time of this proposal. Seventeen “yes” votes were
needed to have it pass. The ﬁnal count was thirteen for,
ten opposed.

It was argued that this was merely another attempt
to “pull the wool over the eyes” of the student body. Sure-
ly such conﬁdence in the knowledge of our students on
this matter is gratifying. It is perplexing, too, considering
that it was also pointed out that the proposed amendment
had been the topic of conversation around the college for
over a week. But then what is the voting power of several
hundred students compared to that of four learned legis-
lators?

It was felt by some that the ofﬁce of SA President is
not that important. It was better, they said, to have a
weak president than to alter the constituion for one per—
son. At the same time, however, it is commonly acknowl-
edged that our new government is in a state of flux and
general instability. it needs a strong, capable executive
ofﬁcer with an equally strong, capable cabinet to back
him up.

Everyone also agreed that the 2.5 academic require-
quirement is too high. but in the next breath several of the
agreeing parties stated that the time to change the clause
was after elections. This implies that it is a fair and ade—
quate provision until the new officers are elected. Then is
it a fair and adequate clause under which elections should
be held now? It is unfortunate that the Student Senators
could not divorce personalities l'rom an issue which will
undoubtedly come up again.

Our ﬁnal word: We only hope that the best qualified
candidate for Student Association President will continue
to help State College by remaining interested and vital
in student affairs. Amen.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 7.

 

| (W KW |
By ART PALAZZOLO

PALACE

The Tarnished Angels starring
Rock Hudson as Burke. “He had
heard all the whispers . . . He knew
just what LaVerne was—but he also
knew that he loved her!" Robert
Stack as Roger . . . “He won La-
Verne on a throw of the dice. He
gave her his name and took every-
thing else!" and Dorothy Malone as
LaVerne . . . “She was sixteen when
she found a dream—and followed it
all the way to hell!" It's based on
the novel Pylon by William Faulk-
ner. “The book they said could
never be ﬁlmed!" Sound familiar?
Also showing is Escapade in Japan
with Teresa Wright and Cameron
Mitchell.

STRAND

Darby’s Rangers starring James
“Maverick” Garner. “The ﬁrst big
story of the American Commandos——
the bold personal story that ﬁnds
the soft spot in America‘s toughest
ﬁghting hearts!" Sounds like Walt
Whitinans‘ doing their ad writing.
“Rollo’s shame: ‘Soldier. I'll bet it’s
your ﬁrst time away from home‘!"
“The shock of Annie and Tina: ‘If
you weren't a baby you'd know a
working girl from a girl on the
streets'!" Now there‘s a poignant
line for you! “Tony's love: ‘Your
hi sband won't shoot us . . . hes' too
nice a man'." (From statements
such as this arose the phrase: “fa-
mous last words!") The second fea-
ture is The Land Unknown. a grip-
ping sagn of survival in the icy
Anartic! (The sneak had a girl
with him though.)

R lTZ

Eighteen and Anxious. “Parents
will be shocked but youth will un—
derstand!" Maybe so. but if youth
did understand, they wouldn't be
doing things to shock their parents
in the ﬁrst place! A vicious cycle!
Also showing is Girl in the Woods.
"In this giant's arms she became a
woman!" lAnd probably got a dose.
of ~missn iv; in the pi'cccssli

LELAND

Men in War starring Robert Ryan
and Aldo Ray. The second shrapnel
torn feature is Attack with Jack
Palance and Eddie Albert. (An eii-
listmeiit booth will be set up in the
lobby for the convenience of all
fired—Lip Stutesmen.)

Russian for “Hi. gang!" Since everyone will now be studying Russian
over TV at 6 am.. we thought we‘d start out right. This is our ﬁrst
column. so all we can say is we're new here and we're going to do our
best. We will try to incorporate the timely and the timeless—what's
always being said and what never has been said. but should be.

HOW WAS IT? NOTHING

Haven't heard that profound question—“How was yom‘ vacation?"—
in days. We guess by now that the “world-is-my-oyster" attitude has
worn off. and everyone is back to his normal grouchy self. Of course.
we have been back FOUR days. And besides. marks came out (on time.

Menirthink, then sign! Sound like ye olde recruiting Sergeant? No—
it‘s just our advice to i‘ushecs. This is the big week—bet you didn't even
know that bids were coming out. did you? But, let's change. Sign, then
think! This would make life much more lively. In this way you'll make
SURE next time. Besides we haven‘t had any excitement around this
parking lot since that Sayles maid caught her toe in the wrlnger.
TOUGH DAR’l‘S

This is for that quaint LITTLE person—the constant complainer.
May his life be merry. but not very long. You name it. and he (or she)
is against it. Of course. we don't have any of these, do we? So, to
anyone who doesn't like our column. we say to you—come and tell us
exactly what it is you dislike. We won't listen to you. but come anyway.
DICKEY DO AND THE DON'TS

This is the name of a group who do a number "Clique Clack.“ a
song that left is to the noise wheels make. This will be our one and only
slam on Student Senate this semester. Of course. don't count on it.
OUTGROWN

New requirements ~l)l‘il(.'i.lCill ones! This old place is seeing the light.
Now il' only the bells. the no-cut system. unfair teachers, and those Ed
coiil'scs that lead nowhere could be given the axe. this would really be
it college. With all this revision what will happen to certain profs?

All this reminds us of the person who learned that repetition brings
learning. Hc was sitting at his desk. saying ovur and over to himself.
