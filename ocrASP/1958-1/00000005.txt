A LONG LETTER HOME

Dear Mother—«queen of the low-
lands. jewel of the East. bright
shining stars of the cosmos, and
great wife to—Father. noble son of
Laertes, master builder of great
generations. lord of the praisworthy
household. designer of fate, and
immortal warrior—

Remember when I told you how I
expected E's in every subject? Well
I went to the mailbox for my marks
last Tuesday, held the envelope in
my hands. and told my friends as I
opened it how I failed everything.
Wasn't I surprised to ﬁnd all A's
on the card? I don't have any
friends right now, but it's wonderful
looking at all those A's. I pasted
the marks on the right pane of my
glasses. and every time I close my
left eye my ego shoots up ten per-
cent.

Of course when I say I got A's in
every subject. I don't include Physi-
cal Education. Not that I don't
consider Phys Ed a subject—on the
contrary, it's a subject of more
ridicule than almost any other sub-
ject—but. it's Just that if I included
it when I say I'got all As. I wouldn't
be able to say I got all A's. And I
want like crazy to say I got all As.
You understand . . . don't you . . .
all A's . . . understand?

Okay. okay. it‘s a dirty lie! I got
two B's as wellebut if I put my
thumb over the bottom of my card.
just see if I don‘t have all A's! Just
you see!

New in your last letter. you said
you couldn‘t understand how I spent
six hundred dollars for books last
semester, If you'll read my letter
a little more carefully. you'll notice
that it said "bookies" and not
“books.” No wonder you were made

who ever heard of spending six
hundred on books for one semester?
You’d have to be a regular spend-
thi'ift to do a sneaky thing like

that! No, good parents. it was spent
on “bookies.” and certainly not
books.

I have to tell you, however. that
books will cost me about ﬁve
hundred this semester, That's
B-O—O-K—S. So send the dough as
soon as possible to your little stu-
dent. okay? (lot it? The dough-
send it! 'I‘hat‘s M—O-N-E—Y. Let's
have some. To me. Quick. Pronto,
Tonto. And don't worry about the
future. They'll be f‘LlflflfllJ, at Sara-
to'ia in Julie. and I got my summer
job back at the pari-iiiutuaf window
—in front of it. of course. So send
that bread. Fred.

The Wiiitcrfudc is coming, and
can‘t go. Why? Why? I'll tell ya!
‘Causc all last summer. Mom, i
asked you to teach inc the rock 'ii'
roll stroll. but you kept insisting
that the pcabody would be the thing
this winter. HA! Now rock 'n‘ roll
is king. and I can‘t do the stroll.
and cvcn my best friends won't tell
me. And you knew all the time.
didn't you? Go ahead. deny it! Buy,
if there's anything gets me mad,
it‘s not being able to do the stroll . . .

. . , Never mind what I Just said.
2.10m «somebody Just told me that
the stroll is dead-weight and that
they're now doing the peabody down
on the Street «that's Green Street,
of course, but I‘m not allowed to
say it anymore sure the Common-
stater said “why do tficse dirty little
columnists haw to say Green Street.

We know it exists ewe go down
there every iiiglit“I.
As for next semester, () great

ones; I've dctidcd that. courses are
detrimental to my studies, and as a
result I'm taking only three hours.
And by golly this time I'm goinr
to attend those three classes a week
if it kills me! After all. I think a
little self-sacrifice is the least a
good student should offer his school.
and diath to those who disagree
with the Open Head.

Whoops I just looked at my cal-
cndar and noticed I have a class
comm: up shortly Later.

DECK THE HALLS

The days grow short, the nights grow long, the north wind
doth blow, and a light frost appears on the knees of coeds.
Christmas is icumcn in, and once more our keen young
minds turn to the vexing problem of Christmas gifts.

Let tis examine first the most vexing of all gift problems:
What do you buy for the person who has everything? Well
sir, when you encounter this dilemma, the best thing.r to
do is seize it by the. horns. Ask yourself this question: Does
he truly have everything? Does be, for example, have a
birthmark'.’ A Mach number? A lacrosse net'.’ An I-beam?
An S-liook? A U—bolt‘.’ A T-square? A Primus stove?

(There is, incidentally, quite an interesting little story
abotitliowl’i'iinuscanictoiiiventtliestove. l’icforel’riinus’s
invention, cooking was rather a hazardous occupation.
People just built fircs any old place—the floor, the closet,
the escritoirc—and often as not the whole house would go
up in flames along with the dinner. Priinus, a goose
plucker of Frankfurt-arn-Nlain, kept. thinking there must
be a more efficient way to cook. Finally, in a flash of in-
spiration, it came to him : Why not build a device to contain
the fire and keep it from spreading?

   

       

' 

/

".1; [ale W151i? lat/{ire z! mfg/417m. '

(Well sir, he built precisely such a device and named it
after his beloved wife Stove. l’riinus’s first Stove, it must
be confessed, was less than a triumph; his mistake was in
building it out of paper. The nch Stove, built of wood,
fared hardly better. Not. until he made one out of metal
could the Stove really be called a success.

(But even then the Stove was not entirely satisfactory.
The trouble was that the Stove filled up with ashes and
became useless after a few weeks. It remained for Pi'imus's
son Frederick to conquer that problem. lle invented a
mechanism to remove ashes from the bottom of the Stove
and was theneefortli known to posterity as Frederick the
Grate.)

But I digress. We were discussing Christmas gifts. This
year, as every year, a popular gift is the smoking jacket.
And what do the smoking jackets smoke? “by, Marlboro,
0f course—every man jacket of them. And why wouldn't
they smoke Marlboros'.’ Why wouldn’t anybody with a
taste bud in his head? You get such a lot to like in a Marl-
boro—filter . . . flavor. . . flip-top box.

“(are is no filter to hollow the checks and bug the eye-
balls; here is it filter that draws nice and easy. More is no
flavor to pale and pull; here is a flavor ever fresh, ever
zestful. Here is no flimsy pack to ci'uiiible and shred its
precious cargo; here is a sturdy box that keeps each ciga-
rette plump and pristine.

Speaking of smoking, the year's most unusual gift item
is a brand-new cigarette lighter that, never needs refilling.
You are scofling. You arc saying you have heard such claims
before. llut it's true, i promise you. This new lighter
never, never needs i‘cfillingl The fuel supply lasts forever.

(if course, there are certain disadvantages. [for one
thing, the lighter is rather bulky—170 feet long and three
