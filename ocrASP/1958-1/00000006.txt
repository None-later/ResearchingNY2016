The rampaging Peds, sporting a
10-1 record thus far this season.

YMCA ﬂoor tomorrow night.

Stop Utica. Potsdam

After capturing a 58-49 victory at

trouble during the first half of their
February 3 game against Potsdam.
Trailing 33-32 at the half, the
Sauersmen returned in the second

aided by the line all-around play
of fresluncn Don Cohen and Junior

Kampf Komments:

The Kid Around 
The Corner  

There once was a little kid around the corner who was
suffering from polio. Many others today are afflicted with
the same dreaded disease. and are in need of care. Some
time ago, the Knickerbocker News here in Albany began
a drive for polio victims known as the drive for the “Kid
Around the Corner." Its current campaign manager is
the Knick's sports editor, Charlie Young and when this
issue of the college paper went to press. the drive had
netted $6,344.03 and was steadily incrcasmg.

State Does Its Share

The sports fans at State were not to be eliminated
from helping the “kid.” Tomorrow afternoon the varsity
wrestling squad will tackle Oswego on the Page Gym mats
and all proceeds from thc gate will be turned over to the
“Kid.” Then on February 22. the basketball team will get
into the Fund by having all thc proceeds from the Statc-
New Havvn game donatcd to the drive. See you at thcsc
cvcnts?

On Tuesday night at thc Washington Avcnuc Armory.
the annual polio baskctball games will be pluycd. Thc
all’air brings some of thc bcst lo ‘21] high school talcnt to—
gctlicr in two games as wcll as a preliminary biddy game
of younger kids. As Charlic Young says. “it‘s youngstch
playing so that other youngsters may walk again.“ Take
my word, it will be a grcut show. and “incrits thc support
of all basketball fans.“

 Say/es Keg/ers Garciamen Face Oswego

After 25-12 Army Setback

By JIM DOUGERTY

After winning their first four
meets with comparative ease. State's
varsity grapplers tasted defeat at
the hands of the West Point J.V.
State could only win one match
against the Black Knights. Charlie
Kane's pin at 5:33 plus a forfeit
and a draw gave the Garciamcn
only 12 points. The Cadets, however,

scored handily and took four
matches and a forfeit to hang a
25-12 defeat, on the Feds. Dave
Pauso won by forfeit and Paul

Harris wrestled to a draw. Joe Hill
was dccisioned illltl Bob Bosom-
