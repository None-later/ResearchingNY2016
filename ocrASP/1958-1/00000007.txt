One seven foot Indian missing.
Minerva shows up at a basketball
game in brand new Springmaid
sheets, and a spear versus hand duel
between the halves. All this, and
the State-Siena basketball game, too.
A Tall “Tail”

The seven foot Indian, which is
to Siena as the “ferocious penquin"
is to state, was kidnapped by sev-
eral of this college's loyal support-
ers after an afternoon of spiritsts).
It was a job comparable only to the
now-famous Brink robbery of a few
years ago.

The Indian-givers, rather stealers,
all were masks (we think), jumped
into a sawed—off limousine, drove
to the Armory, told the watchman
“we‘re from Siena." and noncha-
iantly walked away with Shotdown,
the Siena Indian.

War Paint

He was brought to the college,
painted purple and gold. and put to
bed for the evening. Unfortunately
he was recovered by the Loudonvillc
gang the next morning.

The Indian-stealing was the best
proof of spirit we've seen lately at
State, and contrary to other re-
ports, the freshmen weren’t respon-

Part Two: Minerva took off again

MEMO TO MAESTROS: is your band dawdiing instead of
tootling? Is it full of feeble fifers and drooping drummers?
Well, this musical slowdown may be traceable to lack of
Luckies. Better give your band a break—and make it a
Lucky one! A Lucky, you see, is a light smoke——the right
smoke for everyone. It’s all cigarette-all naturally light,
wonderfully good-tasting tobacco. And Luckies’ fine to-
bacco is LOHSLCQ to taste even better. Now then, what’s a
marching band that never gets at Lucky break? Why, it’s
a Sore Corps! (Wasn’t that cymbal?)

it. This week or next, the Camp Board is meeting
with the architect to get plans for the main lodge.

Starting at the latest by two summers from now,
there can be a definite arrangement for summer
school courses to be offered if accommodations permit.
Such an arrangement would avoid the problems which
have been a stumbling block to having a bus before:
This would be a very
poor time to atempt to sell the camp, dtie to the fact
that the “Northway” is going through or close to
Warreiisburg, which will increase the real estate value
Also the economic

difﬁcult to get our money out of it if' we tried to sell.

The purpose of Student Govern-
ment is to serve the student body. I
believe that Student Government
can serve the student body best by
solving some of the many problems
that our students here at State have.
Problems such as parking facilities,
dorm ﬁre insurance, the increasing
student - tax, c o u r s e s, academic
standing. sports, residence council,
and our college camp.

These problems cannot be solved
by students alone. Students should

be on the college academic, personnel, and services
committees in order to present our views. In this way,

necessity to student government.

In the last two years, the student tax has increased
by $7.50. I strongly believe in setting a student tax
limit and seeing to it that Senate does not appro-
priate funds that will force our student tax over this

In order to create greater interest in our collegiate
teams I strongly

recommend that the Cabinet Recrea-

tional Minister and Varsity Club look into the pos-
sibility of securing chartered buses for some of our

college band would also give a ter-

riﬁc boost to our teams.

One of the biggest problems that we face here at
State is communications or I should say “lack of
communications!!" In order to better the communi-
cations between government and students, I urge the

1. Regular Senate reports at class meetings.
2. The sending of minutes of Senate and Cabinet
sessions to all dormitories and group houses.
23. A central government office in school.

By JOHN STEFANO

Why should a woman be SA
President? This seems to be the
question many people are talking

about this Week, at least after Tues-
day. Naturally this question has
risen because of' the coming election
for SA President. Sometimes we
are muddled in tradition; one of the
recent. fi'eiids has been the i'aet that
for the past fcw years the position
of SA President has been llllt'(l by
a male. Some of the (irads may
recall that the last time if woman
ran for SA President the race was
close and interesting. What I am
leading tip to is the fact that the
highest office in oiir school govern-
ment should not be limited merely

The very unorlgiiial statement
that government as State College
is in a state of transition, change.
and flux should be repeated and
remembered in this campaign. The
growth of the college has necessi-
tated and produced a change in the
form of government. This change.
if it is guided and directed in proper
channels, will be very beneﬁcial to
fill Statcsinen. Conversely. if this
change is allowed to transpire with-
