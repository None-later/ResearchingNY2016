assistance from SA: the role of
student government here would be
to back their work up via the Com-
missioner of Communications.

In order to better coordinate SA
and class government, I would have
a council consisting of the SA Pres-
ident and Veep, plus the presidents
of the classes. The purpose of this
council would be discussion and
comunication. I would also request
more class meetings with Student
Senate reports.

Social Calendar

Part of my platform is an im—
proved social calendar. This means
more big weekends. and as nearly
as possible; events every weekend.
Along with this, I would personally
favor the start of a fifth fraternity
When we get football (probably 3-4
yearSi on ii varsity basis, the new
fraternity could be strong and well-
organized However, this would not
be directly up to the President. of
SA but to IFC; I would back it up.
(‘ommission of Tradition

I would have the Connnissioner of
Traditions do research on what all
the traditions of Albany State are
and have been, sort out the good
from the bad, and publish the find-
ings—4n other words, promote inter-
est in and observance of traditions.
I would back the revision of Ri-
valry now underway, favoring Il
shortcr Rivalry, with greater \'ili'i(‘l_\'
of ('\(.‘IIIH, and 11 change in the worn-
ing system.
New ('iihinct Posts

I Iiich ci'ciitcd four new Cabinet
posts: Leadership, Comiiiuniciitions,
Student—Faculty, and Alumni. The
Leadership Commissioner Would
work with the Junior Class presi-
dent on organizing the freshmen,
looking through records, and talk-

The following statement is re-

"Tuberculosis was considered an
infectious disease by the early
Greek physicians. However, all ra-
tional investigation of disease was
violently suppressed in Europe dur-
ing the Dark Ages because the ac—
cepted thinking was that plagues
and epidemics were the visitations
of an angry God.

“The perfection of the compound
microscope in 1680 paved the way
for the classical studies of Koch
who conclusively proved in 1882 that
tuberculosis was caused by a single

germ identiﬁed as mycobacterium
tuberculosis. Further research and
study increased our knowledge of
this serious disease among whose
victims are included such greats as
Chopin. Von Weber. John Keats,
Robert L. Stevenson and Shiller.

“Perfection of the X-ray machine
was another giant forward step en-
abling the doctor to make an earlier
and more precise diagnosis, and
follow the progress of the patient
under treatment.

“Early treatment methods were
crude and highly ineffective by to-
days' standards. Bed rest, hiin a1-
titudes, and fresh air have yielded
to the specific drugs, and precise
surgery of the present day. As a re-
sult we are confronted by the de-
creasing utilization of beds and the
closing of tuberculosis hospitals.

Death rates, admittedly a crude
measurement, have dropped from 57
per 100,000 in 1931) to about 7 per
cent per 100,000 in 1956.

“Although the above information
may sound as if we no longer need
to be concerned about tuberculosis,
the fact is that we still have many
cases especially in the young adult
age group. Since there is so much
to offer a tuberculosis patient today
in the way of therapy, you owe it
to yourself to be checked by tuber—
culin test and X-i'ay when these are

Never believe a Russian history
boo-k! I have an old one in my pos-
session—it is last year’s. (The au-
thors are enjoying the salt of the
earth in Siberia). Its title is Dus
Prolctariat-skys Nyet-Nyet. In En-
glish this is The People, Yes. (In
Russian as in English, no-no equals
yes.) They claim they can use the
same title as Carl Sandburg be-
cause they were taking their first
Steppes before there were laws
against plagiarizing‘. Sandburg
might be interested in what they’ve
done to his book on Abe Lincoln.
They call Honest Abe the most sub-
versive man that ever lived. They
claim:

1. Lincoln came from a broken
home. (While his farmer father
sowed wild oats. his mother cavor-
ted like a thoroughbred.) My note:
she pulled a plow.

2. He would have been beheaded
by Peter the Great. (Lincoln grew
an outlawed board.)

3. Lincoln's father was a radical
capiat ist. (As he was a member of
the Boston Tea Party, Tom Lincoln
opposed paying taxes.)

4. Lincoln‘s grandfathcr was even
worse, (Mordlcai Lincoln not only
was (1 lll('lllel' of the Whiskey Re-
bcllion— which advocated temper-
ance from vodka A—but he was :in
Enemy of the People.) I hope Ibsen
sues.

but he workcd uidei'covcr. (He
startud ti‘c Lincoln Covered Wiigoll

 

GOODMAN

Ccmpany. This organization bought
out Ford. It was to his theatre,
Ford's Theater, that Lincoln often
went for entertainment; he was
shot here. John Wilkes Booth, a
disgruntled Pilgrim from Plymouth
-—Ford’s competitor, did his vile
deed shouting," Sic-Dele-Caveat
Empton")

6. Lincoln was a drunk. (In a
drunken stupor he wrote the Gettys-
burb Address. Another Cabinet
member of his—Salmon P, Chase,
a very heavy drinker; for whom the
chaser is named -— atteshtsh to
thish.)

7. Lincoln was hypocritical. (He
made U. S. Grant a general because
Grant had the only white horse.
Later, he almost dismissed Grant
when U. S. had too many White
Horses. Lincoln's inherent love for
liquor is well shown by his appoin-
ting of the inept General Meadiel.)

8. Lincoln wasn't honest. (He was
underhanded . . . when he pitched
in his softball league.)

9. Lincoln was a shirker. (During
America's darkest hours . . . he
slept.)

10. Lincoln was abnormal. (With
his height, he didn't play basket-
bill. And he could split rails—with
ti ains on them no less.)

11. Lincoln was an egotist. (He
loved his own face so much that he
had his face put on the penny so
people could see it more often.

Yes, I'll stop. I can‘t read more.
