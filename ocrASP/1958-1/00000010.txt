STATE College CO—OP

By JIM DOUGIIER'I‘Y

Last Saturday Joe Garcia’s mat-
men lost their second consecutive
wrestling meet of the current cam-
paign. The Feds won their first four
meets against Brooklyn Poly, Yes-
hiva, C. W. Post and RPI. The
Army JV and Oswego, however,
were strong enough to defeat the
grapplers from State by rather wide
margins.

In the Polio Match last weekend.
where some wrestled so others might
have the chance to walk, Oswego
pinned a 28-8 defeat on our wrest-
lers. Only two of our matmen could
come out on top over the big and
powerful boys from up North.

Dave Pause Loses First Match
Freshman Dave Pause, previously
undefeated, suffered the ﬁrst setback
of his young college career at the
hands of Oswego's 130 pounder, Bill

Lewis. Dave lost a 6-3 decision.
Dave has scored thus far in the
season a total of 24 points out of
a possible 30.

Joe Hill won a decision in his
match, and Paul Harris lost by de-
fault. Don Warne, co—captain Bob
Bosomworth, John Gremmer and
Joel Smith were all pinned in their
respective matches.

Charlie Kane Leads Team

Norwich, New York‘s contribution
to State, Charlie Kane, is now the
only undefeated grappler with Joe
Garcia's charges. Charlie has won
six straight matches all by pins.
This gives him a total of 30 points
for the season. That is a perfect
record. Kane has a average of (1:19
for each pin. His fastest being :49
against Yeshiva and his longest 8140
against C. W. Post. Nine minutes
is the maximum time for any col-
lege match.

The season of spring sports is
almost here-to witness, the sign—up
sheet for baseball and the usual
talk of intramural softball. The
track fans seem to have been si-
lenced after having had the gall to
ask for the sport twice without
success. That second defeat sound-
ed the death knell for a sport popu-
lar at colleges all across the country.

Kampf Komments:

A Modest

Proposal

 

 

Well, well, student government has an interest in the
sports world. And a fine interest it is. The proposal to
bring together some of the New York State Teachers‘ Col-
leges in a league setup did not originate with one of our
presidential candidates, but her feelings should be taken
up by the entire school in our estimation.

Backlog ()ii The Idea

This idea has bccn discussed in the offices of athletic
directors of various State College campuses and is in the
process of bcing' put to the test at the present time in the
form of a tournament. For the second year in succession,
eight of the numcrous Statc Colleges will meet in Oswego
to participzitc in what appears to be a predecessor to the
formation of a State College l.caguc.

’I‘hc 'l‘ouriuiinciit

’l‘hc cight tcams who will pui'ticiputc in thc Oswcgo
tournaman arc choscn by Dunklc ratings. 'l‘hcsc ratings
are nationwide statistical ratings compilcd to show the
scoring ability of major and minor collcgc teams, They
are based on a 10 point system whcrcby u tcam which av-
erages 10 points better than its opponents should be ablc
to compilc a favorable rating dcpcnding on the capabilities
of its opponcnts and thc kind of teams its opponents play.

For instance, Albany State had won 10 and lost one
game prior to its journey to Ncw York City ovcr thc past
weekend. ()ur Dunklc rating was 40.2 and Brooklyn Poly‘s
was 19.7. This means that State should have beaten Poly
by at lcust 20 points. llchVcr, the final was only 70—04.
What huppcncd to our Dunklc rating? It, no doubt, drop—
pe dbccausc we did not 1ch up to Dunklc’s prediction. The
result of which is that Albany is now sccdcd fourth in the
tournumcnt instcud of sccond or third.

The Future

schools will probably try to cnhst thc formation of a league.

Sauersmen Put 11-2 Record
To Test In New Paltz Bandbox

By JACK LEWIS

On Friday night the Sauersmen will attempt to wipe
out the stain of last weekend’s defeat when they face a
strong New Paltz ﬁve on the opposition’s home court. In
recent meetings with New Paltz the Feds have had a rough
time of it and their 84-75 victory of last year came only
after the game was carried into overtime. Coach Sauers,
expecting a battle will send in Don Bearden, Gary Holway,
Denny Johnson, Jack Bearden and Don Mayer for his

On the following night the Feds will be back home
to meet a tough New Britain squad. This is another game
that Coach Sauers has been pointing toward for some
time and he reports New Britain as, “One of the best teams
we will meet this year. They are built around three little
men." The best of these little men, Stan Gregoritch, is
