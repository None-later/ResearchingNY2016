This week ﬁnds the art exhibit
at our new “Art Gallery," (the foyer
of Draper 349) ﬁnishing its third
week at the college. The paintings,
lithographs, woodblocks, fabrics and
sculpture represent a portion, and a
very poor one, of the creative tal—
ents of the Art department of Bu-
falo State Teachers College.

For those of you who would care
to trek to the "Gallery" and take
a lesson in what not to do with your
‘do it yourself kits,’ let me pen the
following comments.

As you enter you'll stumble over
a painting by Robert Haberer,
called Composition #27. It was done
with enamal paints and has a blue
background on which the artist has
placed a mass of horizontal and
vertical lines with a few diagonal
connectives. He caps this ‘super-
structure’ with a series of circles
and oblongs to complete the geome-
tric motif. This cheerful little de-
sign that is, for the viewer. vaguely
reminiscent of circus tents and
might go nicely as a shower cur-
tain.

Next, we're Looking up an Alley,
by Janet Doub. This is a sound, well
executed ink drawing with one ad-

misable ﬂaw—her overworking of
the central area of drawing.

An oil by Nella May Case called
Landscape catches your eye next,
and here the artist has created a
‘hybrid’ combining the tenents of
the cubist school with angular per-
spective. The drab tones of the
painting mellow some incongruities,
but tend to emphasize the particu-
larly riotous area, the right portion
of the painting.

Laocrlmose, an oil and lacquer
painting by Eugene Pakin has amor-
phous shapes and color diffusions.
The artist uses strippled and pulled
impastos, coupled with obvious lap-
ping of colors to render a great
painting. ’

The Catcher, a fine piece of scul—
ture by George Stark, nudges for
recognition as we turn to leave.
The artist has kept his wits about
him and recreated the dynamic mo-
tions of the player, keeping his work
simple, and anatomically potent.
After paying our respects to this
work, we wipe our hands on the No
fabrics adorning the walls and
shufﬂe out, knowing better shows
are in store for us, as the ‘ebb tide'
is behind us.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 21. I958

        

As I sat down behind the type—
writer with the 1957-58 basketball
schedule in front of me this week.
my eyes rested on the forthcoming
dates of the Oswego State College
Tournament w Thursday. February
27 to Saturday, March 1. After the
tournament there are two remaining
games on the schedule, but they
will be anti—cliiiiatic to the tourna-
ment of pedagogues.

This year's invitation marks our
iirst venture into tournament play.
The Feds are seeded fourth and will
meet Buffalo in the first round on
Thursday.

It's a long trek to Oswego. but
surely there are some hearty States-
iiicii and women who could stand
the journey, It would be a lonely
iouriiainent for the Sauersmen if
they had to go it alone.

Before launching its attack at Os-
wego, the Feds must cope with Pace
College tonight and New Haven to—
morrow. Both games are to be play-
ed on the Page Hall court with
the JV preliminary games getting
under way at 6:45. The New Haven
contest is the one to which the
Sauersmen have been pointing "to-
wards since losing earlier in the year
at New Haven. An added feature to
tomorrow‘s game is the benefit i‘0i

Around The Boards With Pictures

As a tribute to the Sauersmeii, T
have arranged the sports page in a
pictorial setup to mark the season
game by game. The scenes por—
trayed are present at every gain.-
and never seem to dull. At top cen-
ter, the Feds form a pro-game lind-
die around their coach for that
added pep talk; to the right and left
of the team, the pre-gaiiie warm
up drills are shown in the person
of Gary Holivay and Toni Bauglian
as they toss their favorite shots at
the netth hoop. Coming around to
the left. the cheerleaders tci-iiiiiiatc

picture of Holway's stylish lay-up

congratulates Don Mayer after the
Feds had taken one of their 12
victories to date. That player soar-
iiig in for two poliits at bottom
right is freshman Jack Beardon.
who has been a boast to the Feds
all season. and though only 5'9.
leaves lots of space between him-

It seems superfluous to say. GOOD

that is our sentiment.
