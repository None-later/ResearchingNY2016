The Russian people are extremely
curious of the American way of life.
That is why the Russian govern-
lnent issued a short short l the Rus-
sians like short shorts) entitled
American Non-Censored.

It starts having Ivan the Bear
growling. A leaky tub called the
USS. Yankee Clipper II struggles
past an armada of Russian A-subs.
The captain is too bimy reading
Peyton Place to notice. In the dis-
tance is a monument labeled the
Statue of Opression. In her left
hand she has U.S.A. Conﬁdential.
In her right is a burning torch
dedicated to all those Americans
that died of lung cancer. On board
the Clipper II are a hundred im-
migrations from Hungary. The crew
is chained to their posts. They are
guarded by a mass of moustacth
Simon Legrees. On deck. a Russian
spy turns to his wife and says.
“Where is the Empire State Build-
ing?" She, also a. spyess. grins and
answers. “In the North. the Seaway
and in the West. the Thruway."
Another spy spying on theln. strides
over and stabs the woman saying.
“Good Humor is not Tolerated." Shc
falls gurgling, “They jest at scars
that never felt a wound." Both men
choke her.

Unseen—below deck. a fettered
prisoner throws the last chunk of
coal on the fire. “Fool! You've
wasted the last piece of fuel.” The
accuser is an image of John Foster
Dulles. The stoker mumbles, “Never
fear. Master.” and jumps into the
ﬁre. John Foster reaches in and
beats the ashes screaming "Coward!"
Then he adds another notch to his
brief case. (He keeps his under-
shorts in it).

Casper Ahab. a member of the
KKK, leans over the stern saying.
“Lad the Great White one has
chided us again." “Tough harpoons".
says Pithius. his friend. In a ﬁt of
anger. Ahab throws a voodoo doll
of Pithius overboard. The Morrocan
apprentice follows it overboard cry-
ing, “I don't wuv you anymore."

The Captain surveying the harbor
sees a woman that looks like Sophia.
“Bring me my spyglass!" he inter-
jects. Spy No. l with vodka glass
in hand. forgets his position and
races up to the bridge. He manages.
“Herewtake mine." The second spy
quickly gains his composure. He
grabs his portfolio, and pulls the
zipper, The hapless ﬁrst spy. realiz-
ing his mistake. turns just as he
receives the slug from the zip gun
in the somach. He falls—quite dead.
