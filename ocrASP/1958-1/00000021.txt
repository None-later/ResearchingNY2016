Senate Approves Cabinet; Bridge Tourney

Includes New

Publicity Post

By RICHARD KENDALL

John Yager, newly elected Presi-
dent of Student Association, con-
vened the first meeting of the 1958
Senate in the Government Room of
Brubacher on Wednesday evening.
Twenty-five of the twenty-six Sen-
ators were present to give their
prompt and unanimous assent to
Yager's appointment of Ann O'Con-
nor as Senate secretary and Frank
Krivo as Parliamentarian. In an
equally quick manner they approved
the reappointment of Giesle Boulais,
Helen Mansar. Anthony Corcella,
Phil Sheppard, and Arlene Luick
to Election Commission.

Cabinet Approved

In the same spirit of universal
agreement, the largely neophyte
Senate gave its rapid confirmation
to President Yager’s nominations for
the Student Asociation Cabinet. In
the coming year the Cabinet will
have Carol Scheu as Services Com-
missioner, Don McLain on Tradi-
tions, Gary Holway iof basketball

patrick on Publications, Ann King
on Special Days, Minna Podber on
Religious, Lee DeNike of Honoraries,
Winnie Youngs on Culture, Jane
Cass on Finances, Don Beardon
«also going West for tournament
time) on Fraternities and Sororities.
Joan Novak will serve as Publicity
Commisioner, though some vigorous
protest was raised by Nat Lemoin,
an intrepid veteran of two years of
Parliamentary smoke and debate.
Opinion appeared divided on the
advisability of creating a new Cab-
inet post, but Yager clinched the
issue by appealing to the Senate to
support this policy for the good of
the school. Result: Yager—24, Le-
moine-l. The ayes have it.

New Committees

The parade of appointments con-
tinued with the President filling out
the three key committees. The all-
lrrrportant Finance Committee will
be chairmanned by Chuck Fowler,
with Doug Penfield, Ron Short, Stu
Nook, Kay O’Connor, Arnie Roth-
steln, and Dave Meade as members.
Rhoda Levin will direct the Rules
Committee, with Marty Goodrich,
Jay Kohen, Bill Gardner, and Marty
Lesick as members. Nat Lemolne
is chairman of the Election Com-
mittee which will have R0 Walsh,
Barbara Vaas, Paul Hooker, and R0
Bordanaro as its personnel.

New Bills

President Yager introduced a bill
to provide for new elections to fill
the vacancies on the Senate, on
Myskania and in the classes. The
bill was referred to committee and
in all probability will be reported
out for Senatorial debate next week.
The meeting was adjourned at 8:55
pm, which is possibly the all-time
indoor record for Senate adjourn-
inent.

DONKEY-DUST around the
QUAD: Ann Fleming is secretary
of the Cabinet, which should add
the right touch of eye-appeal to
proceedings. . . . Dick Kendall, old
S.A. Proxy, received his going away
present—~thank you, old Senate . . .

Lemoine, Fowler, Penfield . . . a
member of the Rivalry Committee
resigned with a scorching letter
which would burn the eyes, ears,
nose and throat of several of the
new S.A. officers. . . . Rivalry, by
the way, will include a “walk-back-
wards day" for the fresh next year,
and a tug-of—war across Washing-
ton Park‘s pond.

alian, and one Russian. Last sem-
ester on.y one American film was
shown, for which we had received
numerous requests both from fac-
ulty and patrons. The other Ameri-
can films were chosen for a variety
of reasons: Thief of llang is an
early silent film; A Star Is Born is
one of the first technicolor motion
pictures; Living Desert contains ex—
cellent photography and original
studies of American wild life. The
uneven distribution of foreign films
over the two-semester program was
occasioned by scheduling difficulties
With the distributing agencies; for
said difficulties we tender our sins
cere regrets.

We hope the preceding para-
graphs have enlightened Mr. Palaz-
zolo, and we suggest that in the fu—,
ture he remember the distinctions
between the two groups. Incident-
ally, we can't recall seeing him at
any of I.F.G.‘s foreign films last
semester.

Sincerely,
Beverly J. Rahn, President,

Concessions Begin At 8:30

Tomorrow night the lower halls and rooms of State
College will be the sites of much activity as the different
organizations and houses on campus again try to raise
money at their concessions for the fund used to sponsor
a foreign student. State Fair ﬁrst began during the war
as a war relief effort. Although State Fair is the source
of a major part of the foreign student fund, the faculty,
faculty wives and administration contribute a stubstantial
amount through their participation in the program.

Show I mpossib/e

The following is a statement from
Richard Esner '59, Co-ordinator of
State College Revue

"After conferring with Deans
Stokes and Hartley it was decided
that the much talked about third
performance of “The Boy Friend"
will not be possible.

“This being the case, if you have
tickets for Saturday night and your
parents are not coming up, please
exchange them for Friday night as
we will need all the tickets we can
get. Last year many parents were
turned away and again this year it
promises to be the same. Many par-
ents who are coming up to Parents'
Day will not be able to see the show
as Saturday is sold out."

Problems

Tickets for both the Friday and
Siturduy performances of "The
Boy Friend" went on sale last Mon-
day morning at 9 am. By noon ai—
inost the complete orchestra and a
good part of the balcony were sold
out for the Saturday show. Much
consideration had been given to the
possibility of having 21 third por-
foi‘munce on Saturday afternoon. but
it was decided that this would in-
volve too many prob‘cins since the
programs for the afternoon had
already been set up.
