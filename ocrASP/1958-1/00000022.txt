Et Tu, Brute . . .

Praise be to those that deserve and impeach those
that don’t do as the class demands. This seems to be the
motto of the freshman class as we saw it at the meeting
last Friday. For those of you that missed the little get-
together last week, we will let you in on the facts.

It seems that the frosh have a newspaper and an
editor. The only thing that seems to bother them is that
they don’t care too much for the paper nor the editor.
So like all good Americans they decide to try to impeach
the editor. We feel that nothing will come of any of this
impeachment business, but just the idea of it is bad for
the class.

As the newspaper staff, we feel that we can be pretty
good judges when it comes to other newspapers, their
policies and their editors. We have praised this little paper
in the past and we continue to do so. Granted, it is not
the best we have ever seen, but for a class project we think
it is excellent. The editor and his staff have done a very
ﬁne job and they deserve much credit, even if a few of the
frosh don’t seem to agree with our opinion. Your selection
of an editor shows us that you do have good sense at times,
but that somewhere along the way you lose all sense. Just
because one or two happen not to win or were criticized
by the editor is not sufﬁcient reason to impeach him. He
deserves much praise for his writing ability and technique.

We would like to ask the frosh a question. You have
just selected a President and by all rumors he is a very
capable young man and should do much for the beneﬁt
of your class. Now should he step on someone, hurt their
feelings, or break one or two of the rules, would you im-
peach him also? We think not. The editor of your paper
is an elected ofﬁcer. He and his staff deserve all your sup-
port and help. We do not mean that you should not criti~
czie, if you feel them doing wrong, but to impeach some-
one is a serious thing. Everyone can beneﬁt by criticism
once in a while, but not to the extent you have gone.

What, Again . . . ?

Good old Albany State’s administration comes through
again!! Last week we attacked the administration for
curriculum—well, this week we are attacking them for the
school’s prestige.

Ever since we have arrived at State, we have heard
nothing but lack of school spirit. Even the dear adminis-
tration has complained about it. Well, this week the stu-
dents really went wild as evidenced by the attitude of the
students and the pep rally held Wednesday evening for
the game with Rider.

Everyone went out of their way to build this up into
something big—give the school the added spirit it has so
long been lacking. A number of students (at their own ex-
pense) made plans to go to the game in Trenton. So, when
the permission was asked for the girls, the permission was
denied.

Last week at Oswego the school was closed for two days
so that the student body could support their team at the
tournament. We can’t even get extended hours. Further—
more, the administration should have provided buses for
the students. The interest and desire were there, but the
way was blocked.

We just hope the administration is happy that they
have killed the spirit they have so long been demanding
of this student body. We‘d just like to say thanks to the
administration for everything. . . .

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. MARCH 7.

 

Notice

By ART PALAZZOLO

Another week has passed since our
last little get-together, and al-
though the sncw has been reduced
to blackened giobs, the gurgling
streams from the melting glob are
still running merrily in their jour-
ney to the sewers. You may say
that's all well and good. and it's
fine that the happy gurgling streams
are carrying the snow—turned-glop
to the sewers, but what has that to
do with the movies? The answer is
absolutely nothing! Running streams
like running noses evoke from me
strange responses. Now that I've set
the proper mood, let's turn to the
movies for this week.

PALACE

Deborah Kerr, David Niven, Jean
Seberg and My.ene Domongeot star
in Otto Preminger's Bionjour Tris-
tessc. This is a story based on Fran-
coise Sagon's best-seller of “five un-
conventional people competing for
licks, pleasure and love." For those
of you who get their "kicks" from
this kind of movie, it is highly rec-
ommended. Also showing is The
Hard Man with Guy Madison and
Valerie French. If you like westerns,
by all means see it. Me, I'd rather
listen to gurgling streams.

STRAND

The Quiet Man starring Audie
Murphy and Michael Redgrave. The
story of an American (Audie) in
Saigon and the havoc he creates
wherever he goes. The second feat-
ure is Sing Boy Sing with Tommy
Sands wiggling all over the place
and coming in a poor second to my
boy Elvis.

LELAND

Blood of Bataan. "Savage! Sear-
ing! See captive women tortured
with unspeakable barbaritv! Atroci—
ties! Violence! Terror!" Bring the
whole family for a fine evening‘s
entertainment. Also showing is Ma-
cumba. Jzirring, joltiiig jungle
thrills of adventure never before
filmed. It's henrt-rciiding.
DELAWARE

Held over for n second week is
All At Sea starring Alec Guinness
who gives with his Lisuul l'iiie hum-
01‘.

er smashes her. Guilietta, the Ven-
ice beauty, who is his second love,

third love is under a spell cast up-
on her by her mother's ghost. The
voice urges her to die and sing in
the Supernatural Choir. All action
is done in ballet.

Translation

The movie is in French, but a
synopsis of the story (in English)
will be given by Miss McGough be-
fore the film begins. It contains
three separate stories. so that any-
one may come in late and still see
the remaining one or twu stories.

No admission will be charged.

 

Senate:

Senate Refuses To Reinstate
Preferential Voting System

By RICHARD KENDALL

President John Yager lost his first
important Parliamentary battle
Wednesday night when the Senate
refused to reinstitute the preferen-
tial system of voting. The Election
Committee reported back Yager’s
proposals for the cumbersome pref—
erential balloting, but forceful de-
b' te and maneuvering by Senators
LeMoine and Penfieid, on a motion
to amend the voting procedure.
swung more than half the Senate
to the system based on percentage
quota and plurality. L. & P.——15,
J.Y.—8. Oh, yes . . . the entire mo-
tion and vote was out of order be-
cause President Yagcr relinquished
and then resumed the Chair during
debate, which is Parliamentarily i1-
legal. The ayes have it, but not
really.

Earlier in the evening there was
some sharp discussion concerning
the dates on which to hold the re-
placement elections, but propriety
and organization were maintained
by strong use of the gavel. Gavel
or not, argument was quickly re—
placed by confusion on the mathe-
matical intricacies conjured up by
the subt‘eties of multiplication and
subtraction involved in determining
the quotas for the elections of
March 13 and 14. After some schol—
astic definitions of “votes cast” and
a dialectic on the uncertainties of
democracy. it was determined that
a plurality of roughly two and one
half million votes are needed to
elect a new Myskania member, pro-
viding at least 80"; of fraternity and
sorority members vote, excluding
pledges with less than a 2.5 average.

All the election bills were passed
by the Senate, though there was

some difficulty in making total
votes cast equal the number of Sen-
ators present. The meeting adjourn-
ed at 10:25 p.m.

DONKEY DUST AROUND THE
QUAD: One of the fraternities came
within several votes of suspending
one of State's Loyal Sons for bad
conduct involving the use of certain
household words in a popular pub
. . . the enforcement of morality is
laudable, but in this context rather
silly, for in undertaking to answer
for the actions of individuals at
non-fraternity functions, the frater-
nity is assuming responsibilities it
cannot possibly fulfill, though its
failure to do so would in turn bring
censure on the organization.

says little, but would make an in-
