STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY. MARCH 7. 1958

 

Sucker Born Every Minute; Class Presents Sayles HallCops Top Honors;
State Fair Collects Suckers Oral Readings Ridge EaseslntoSeconcl Spot

Two thousand people (supposedly)
coicentratr. on one thing: How to
make money in quantity. The first
thought has to be dismissed for lack
of presses and interference from the
law. But two thousand people still
concentrate and come up with some
pretty original ideas to rake in the
sheckles.

Begin with thirty-four groups.
two organizers and an idea; end
with State Fair, the Greatest Ever.
The basic promotion, a light bulb
and slogan originated by a rabbit.
The net result, a successful evening
resulting in pretty girls on campus.

Now there are various ways to
make money; consider subjecting
yourself to wet sponges. allowing
people to let off excess hot air,
showing off your “talent,” marrying
people, selling pizza. etcetera, etcet-
era.

If you think of State Fair as a
circus you might think of it as tak-
ing advantage of the “sucker born
every minute" but it's not a hoax,
folks, it‘s the one time that every

organization at State focuses on
one thing.

You make posters. you promote,
you encorrage, you boost, you raf-
fle, you clean, you plan, you prac-
tice, you compete. And maybe you
make more money that anybody
else. At any rate you have a good
time and you accomplish something
to be proud of.

You might say that sport spot—
light belongs to the basketball team
this week, but while it is garnering
all the oats in varsity honors. others
continue their weekly display of tal-
ent in intramurais.

O'icc again this week. Bruce Lib—
bons of the Sayles bowling team
returns to the spotlight for his 1'76-

”. 201-149-526 series which assisted his

team to the Intramural champion-

Following close behind him for top
honors is Keith Kenipto': who hit
high series for the week with a 562
set for Ridge.

THE REALLY GREAT MEN of history are forgotten men. Who did throw

Let’s honor the guy who supplies the one cigarette that’s packed end

auersmen Take Filth Place in Oswego Tournament;

Defeat Harpur, 69-60, To End 15-3 Regular Season

 

Kampf Komments:

‘Twas The

 

Night Before . . .

 
 

'Twas the night before the big game and all through
the hotel, the ghost of Pontiac was sounding his knell'. . .
The basketball team all tucked in their beds, with v'iSions

of trophies dancing in their heads. .

. .Hoppy in his “ker-

chief" and Coach in his “Cap” had just settled down for a

much needed nap. .

. . When all of a sudden there arose

such a clatter, without a doubt it disturbed the latter . . .
the radiators knocking, the corridors rocking, noise from
the trains was just as shocking. . . .

The dawn when it came so early and bright found
many a man all sore and so tight . . . lunches at ten may
not seem appealing, but at least they satisfy that stomach

feeling. . . .

At two we played the Buffalo Bills, but it would have

been better to take to the hills. .

. . The ﬁnalists from the

west ran up the score and the Feds were behind, 63-54_. . . .
February left in a mood of melancholy, but Dick’s haircut
brought March in with folly. . . . With Potsdam next, the
Feds had a date and beat them they did,‘57-4.8. . . . Fifth
place was our prize and win it we did, inspired by Don
Beardon, the Watertown kid.

School banners from the ceiling were hung with care,

and the Oneonta Dragonettes maneuvered there. .

..Al-

bany might not have ﬁnished best but the pedagogue tour-

ney was simply a test. . . .
Sayles Bowlers Tops

Next to the varsity basketball team this week, I'd like
to salute the Sayles Hall bowling team which won the
coveted AMIA Bowling League trophy Wednesday by Vll‘-
tue of its 4-0 count over SLS. The Saylesmcn compiled
a 34-10 record as it stole the show from Ridge and the four
frats. The team is composed of four freshmen and a senior
who worked together to grab their just dcscrvcs.

, Tribute...

While everyone around the campus is busy con-
gratulating the team and bidding them, bon voyage,
there are a few men who are standing as backdrops
to all the commotion on the front of the stage. The
pcople in question are Joe .losezewicz, Varsity man-
ager; Dick Solomon, trainer; Tom Hoppey, assistant
coach, and last but. by no means least, the center of
this tribute. Bill Randall, Publicity Director for the
Sauersnieii.

Pictures Part of Bill's Work

Bill made his way to Oswego with the Feds to take
care of the major portion of the publicity angle. The
pictures appearing on this page were taken by Bill as
part of his stunt to help build up the team. At the
top. from left to right, the famous Oneonta State
Dragonettes form a V-formation for their team, which
Albany defeated in the last round of the consolation
end of the tournament. In the followingr three photo
series, Don Beardon. Gaiy Holway and Don Mayer
all appear to be taking pop shots at the hoop under
which Holway is about to score two points against
Potsdam. Beardon's shot came earlier in the same
game while Mayer gets a good luck top on the head
from Oneonta's Al Bush. In closing this tribute I
just want to say, thanks Bill, for bringing a part of
.he Oswego toui'iiaiiieiit bank to school with you.

Gary Holway Earns
All-Star Honors

One of the most successful, if not the
most successful season in the history of
Albany State College basketball is complete
today and as of last night the Feds were
seeking their worthy deserves in Trenton,
N. J. What happened there is not for us to
say thanks to a Wednesday night deadline.

If the Sauersmen were victorious last
night they will set out for Kansas City,
Missouri, and the NAIA finals this weekend.
If otheiwisc stated, the Feds deserve a pat
on the back for the prestige they brought
to themselves and the college.

Epilogue to Oswego

State completed its regular season with
a 15-3 record after dribbing Harpur, 69-60,
at Binghamton Tuesday night. Added to
its 2-1 ﬁfth place showing in the Oswego
tournament, the Feds took a 17-4 record to

BK. Trenton with them against 16-6 Rider.
