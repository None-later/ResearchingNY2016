Curtain To Go Up Tonight On [The Boyfriend];

% ‘ Successful Broadway Play Features All Student Cast

Page Hall Production Brings
The Twenties To Life Again

Popular opinion has it that the nineteen-twenties were

a “roaring” decade. Mothers and fathers of today had the
Charleston, short skirts, ﬂappers, hip ﬂasks, the razz-a-
matazz and the Dixieland jazz, music by the Fire House
Five plus Two, raccoon coats, and the moving spirit of the
age, Rudy Vallee. What do we have today? The same
thing but in a different format. So, the students at Albany
State College for Teachers are going to revert to the “old”
style by bringing to life on the Page Hall stage, the Broad-
way production of “The Boyfriend,” a three-act musical
comedy which had an extended run on the Avenue of Stars,
tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 pm. “The Boyfriend,”
brings to life again the atmosphere and the spark which
were a part of the period. It will take Mom and Dad back
to their youth and show Junior and Sis that Elvis Presley
and his Rock and Roll Union were not always the principal
ingredients in the world’s make—up.
Cutain Going Up

‘ The action of the play takes place in and around a
girls‘ ﬁnishing school on the French Riviera. The wit and
humor of the '20’s presents itself from the moment the
curtain goes up. Even with its sobs and tears, the direction
of the play can be seen immediately—like the age, each
person has to have a mate and the ending has to have
a boola-boola ﬁnish.
