State College Jurors At Moot Court Convict
alicious, Drunken Behavior

By MARLENE ACKERMAN

“I object, that’s a leading ques..
tion."

“Objection overruled."

“For the beneﬁt of the jury, will
you please . . 

For the benefit of those of you
who haven't the slightest idea what
is goingr on. these are jutt a few
quotes from a trial . . . a trial of
the Moot Court of Albany Law
School. Approximately 130 State
College students with majors in
Business and SOClJl Studies llilVI'
been sexing as jurors for these
trials.

This year there has bccn shown
a great interest in thc Moot Cour'
.ury and all dcpzirtmcnts of the cur
riculum have asked to I)ﬂl'i.lt'.l])llti
in the program. Since it is primarily
for the beneﬁt of the Business Edu
cation Department, the others will
have to wait. It is hcpcd that next
year more students will be able to
participate,

This is a unique experiment cm~
barked upon by the combined effort:
of Albany Law School and Stiitc
College. Alfred I. Maleson, Profes—
sor of Albany Law. and Albert (7
Mossin, Associate Professor of Busi-
ness, State, are supervising thi.
program.

What Is A Moot ('ourt‘.’

The M0ot Court is it practicc court
for Senior law students. Each trial
is- prcparcd in the form of ii prob-
lcm. The facts are written down
and exhibits prepared for use :is
midencc. Parts for the witncssc
are written, each part l)l.'lll§.', .issicn-
ed to some particular law studcnt
Two stcdcnt “lawyers” are iissiuico
to the defense and t\vo to thc tilttllt
tiff in a civil case or to l‘Ole'f‘Sl'll:
the state in a criminal case. Thcsi
cases are based on actual (lf‘fflsloils
of the courts. Certain facts on
changed, however, and situations sit
up. Area lawyers and judges con-
tribute their services as pri-sidmg
justices. The trials are held in thc
court room of the Albany Law
School.

The trials are arranged in a
manner similar to a tennis tourna-
ment, with the winning teams icach
consisting of two student lawyers:
competing against other winning
tcams down to quarter-finals, semi»
ﬁnals, and ﬁnals. The winners of
the nuts compete against. finalists
from other law school.- in a rc-
gionai tournament.

Mutuiilly Advantagi'ous

Law school students cxpcricncc
the psychological spur which comcs
from trying their cases bcfol‘c ii jury
not consisting of their fcllow law
students as previously done. Experi—
cncc as a juror also serves as :i
signficant practical supplement to
classroom work in business law and
for the subsequent teaching of bust
ncss law.

more heated than Senate's.

so close together would have placed
a terriﬁc strain on the members of

before you expound. get the facts.

it seems unfortunate that the

deserving of our respect should be
smcurcd in this way, especially when
the smear is so unfounded. And
this "sinivu'iiig" (IS I call it hasn't
bcen limitcd to the administration.
I'd like to point out that for many
students. Htutc (‘ollcgc News is their
chief source of information When
the editorial policy, the Senate re-
ports, and the fcnturcs all tear down

Constructive criticism on the port
of the State (‘ollcge Nt‘Ws can play
on important part in presenting
isucs and in bringing them to a
head. And occasionally destructivo
criticism :5. the only way to brin‘i
these issues to a head. However,
I‘m very surc that a generally nega—
tive policy on the part of a news—
paper is most unwise. Furthermore
we ccrtuinly do need a mouth wash
when till the negativity is concen-
trated in one particular is~uc.

Ministers Discuss Budget;
Considers ‘NEWS' Policy

By DAVID FOTHERINGHAM

The first. internal conﬂict of the
year arose last Tuesday in the Cab-
inet’s second meeting. as John
Yager tried to get the endorsement
of his letter criticizing the editor
of to State College News, who,
Yager felt, was unjustified in criti-
cizing the College administration.

First, President Collins has been
working toward having student rep-
rcsentatiou on Curriculum Council.
This will start next September,
since the work for this year is
finished. Secondly, Yager reported
that the administration would have
extended hours if we had won at
the Oswego tournament. The buses
are the responstbility of the stu-
dents. Extendin'.r hours for girls in
general on a School night seems to
be a poor idea, but the question re—
mains as to why cheerleaders don‘t
go to away games.

The cabinet. in general, objected
to influencing any part of editorial
policy. Don McClain refused to
stand behind any Cabinet action
on this issue. Others followed in
objection. Rary Fitzpatrick said
that she talked with the adminis—
tration on these issues and was
given none of this information, The
administration, then. is not always
consistent in policy. Maybe they
should get together so the students
could be sure of one policy. This
was again pointed up by June Cass
who said that in her chairmanship
of Parents Day she ran into con—
flicting policies when discussing
plans.

No action was taken, but State
(‘ollcge News will take its second
spanking from Senator Fowler‘s
Bill iScc Richard “Donkey Dust"
Kendalli.

Budgets

Yager assigned the various bud-
get groups to the appropriate minis-
ter. All budgets must be handed to
the Cabinet minister no later than
March 20. The Cabinet will then
consider all budgets and recommend
to the Senate a ﬁnal draft and the
amount of Student Tax. Many in-
teresting considerations will be at
hand, i.e.. will Myskania keep its
key line? The Senate will consider
ﬁnished business, since Yager has
set up an intricate committee sys-
tem involving every Senator on
budgets and making it almost im—
possible to add lines on the Senate
ﬂoor.

Also on the agenda—~MUD, Cam—
pus Commission, dinner with the
Deans, all coming up later.
