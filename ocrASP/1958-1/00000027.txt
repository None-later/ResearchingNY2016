ForNationWide Competition

Glamour magazine is devoting its
entire issue to college fashions. At
that time will be featured ten “Best
Dressed College Girls in America."
The top ten will be chosen from
entries submitted by colleges all
over the country.

Below we have printed a nomina-
tion blank which you should use to
nominate who you think qualifies
as a well-dressed girl. Nominations
will be closed Wednesday, and
should be returned to the News
Board via Student Mall. Anyone
wishing to nominate a candidate
shou (1 clip out the blank, enter on
it both the name of his candidate
and his own name. All undergradu-
ate women are eligible.

Those receiving the top 10"? of
the nominations will be the final-
ists for Albany State. From those
News Board will then choose one

finalist to compete in the national
contest with those entered by other
colleges.

Factors which will be considered
in the final judging are taste,
grooming, and general wardrobe
planning; an expensive wardrobe is
not essential. The name of the final
contestant from Albany State will
be sent to Glamour magazine by
April 1, along with three photo-
graphs of her.

Photographs of the ten winners
chosen by the magazine will appear
in the August issue. Each of the ten
will be awarded a "Best Dressed"
award. One of the awards will in-
clude a trip to New York. During
the visit they will stay at the Wal—
dorf Astoria and will participate in
Glamour’s Colege Fashion Show
and will be interviewed and enter-
tained by the editors.

Darn it, the snow has gone and
with it's departure I’ve lost an ideal
topic as a ﬁller for this column.
You see, it works this way: The
space allotted for this column can-
not be determined until all letters
to the editor have been received.
Kapital Kapers usually squats atop
these letters to the editor. The
more letters, the shorter my col-
umn, and vice-versa. If you have
such poor taste as to dislike this
column, you have two courses of
action open to you. (1) By exerting
superhuman effort you can stop
reading the column, or izi you can
write me a long nasty letter asking
embarassing q u e s t i o n 5. Either
method will prove highly effective.
Being modest as a shy violet, I fully
realize that you don’t read this
column to keep up on the latest
conditions of Albany's melting
snowbanks, nor do you care how
loud the streams gurgle, but rather,
just to learn what’s playing at the
movies. No more. no less. And with
that in mind, let us turn once again
to the movies at hand.

PALACE

Raintrcc County starring Mont-
comcry Clift. Elizabeth Taylor, Eva
Marie Saint and Lee Marvin. “A
very special entertainment event!
See why they say it‘s tremendous!"
They say it's tremendous—not me!
Anyway, it’s been nominated for
four Academy Awards and “Best
Actress" for Liz's performance.

DELAWARE

The Golden Age of Comedy is a
collection of some of the best old
time movies with such old time
favorites as Laurel and Hardy, Jean
Harlow, Will Rogers, Carol Lom-
bard, Ben Turpin and many others.
If you get a charge out of this type
of humor. you'll laugh yourself sick.
I know I did. Also showing is
Silken Altair with David Niven and

Genevieve Page. One of those
suave British imports.
LELAND

Another double spectacle-horror!
Viking Women and the Sea. Serpent
with real Vikings. The second thril-
ler is The Astounding She Monster.

“Fabulous!” “Fantastic!” Terrify-
ing!" “Frightening!” Corny!
MADISON

Slaughter on 10th Ave. A slam-
bang, sock-‘em movie with plenty
of raw action. The second feature
is Quantez.

 

Coach Richard Sauers has reieas-
ed a sixteen game baseball schedule
for the 1958 season.

The opening game of the year
will be played at Bleecker Stadium,
April 19, against Utica College. The
Feds, who had a below .500 season

Spat! granary/t!

Alas, men. the women have taken
over. For the past few weeks the
spotlight has been filled by that
sturdy specie, the male, but now,
cut of the darkness steps a maiden,
so tar and lovely, and full of pep.

She moved right in and stole the
show from the male populous this
week thanks to her feat which
earned her sorority, Phi Delta, a
tizrce point VictOIy over Beta Zeta,
and first place in the WAA bowling
loop. She is . . . Jean Nicolai.

faces this year since there are only
a few returning veterans. The only
new team listed on the released ros-

By JIM nouoneurr
The varsity wrestling season is over. What happened
of signiﬁcance? A record of seven wins and three loses; an
undefeated Sophomore; a new fresman sensation; and
probably most important, great show of spirit by the stu-

dents of this college.

Coach Joe Garcia saic “it was the support of the stu-
dents in school and the untiring efforts of the boys on the
team that produced a ﬁne record and kept the team in
competition." It was boys like .Iack Lewis, Don Warne and
Mike Kessler who went on the mat with little or no ex—
perience and did their utmost to secure a couple of points.
Kane. Pause - Star; Bosomworth Inspires

Charlie Kane, elected captain of next year’s varsity
along with Joe Hill, has just completed his ﬁrst undefeated
season. Charlie is now 19-1 for two years here at State. He
was also awarded the team’s Most Valuable Wrestler trophy
for his “untiring eﬁorts” during the season.

Dave Pause, a product of

Mont Pleasant High in Sche—

nectady and three varsity wrestling campaigns in high
school, proved that he was a true collegiate wrestler by
compiling a won-loss record of eight and two.

A pat on the back also goes to co-captains Bobby Bo-
somworth and Wayne Harvey along with Paul Harris, Joe!
Smith and John Gremmcr for their efforts during 1957-58.

Bob Bosomworth, a Long Island Senior, was undoubt—
edly the guiding light of the Garciamcn. His great spirit
and leadership will always be remembered.

The Albany State Teachers Col-

with a 17—5 record a year ago, has
completed the 1957-58 season with
an identical slate.

By virtue of it 52-42 setback at
Trenton, N. J. at the hands of Rider
College in the District 31 playoff.
the Albanian squad missed a chance
to travel to Kansas City for the
NAIA ﬁnals. However, Rider didn't
fare much better, getting beat in
the ﬁrst round, 93-76, by George-
town, Kentucky.

First Post Season Tourney

This past season presented Al-
bany with another ﬁrst in its long
history of court play, its bid to a
post season tourney. Though the
setback was a disappointment to
the entire student body, the Sauers-
men are looking forward to another
chance next season. The Feds will
lose only co—captains Don Mayer
and Dick Causey via the gradua-
tion line, and will be lead by Gary
Holway, captain elect.

The Rider game was nip and tuck
all the way, with a “cold” Albany
shooting hand being the deciding
factor. Coach Sauers charges hit
on only eighteen of ﬁfty—nine shots
for a thirty per cent night from
the ﬂoor, while Rider capitalized on
48 per cent, 24 for 49.

Coach Sauei's optimism for next
year centered around the perform-
ance shown by his freshmen play-
ers during the past campaign. He
said, "I never expected to win
seventeen games this season. That
we did win is a result of the ﬁne
performances of our new players.
Our freshmen like Don Cohen and
Jack Bearden played much better
ball than the average new player

All-Opponent Team Selected

At the close of the season, the
Feds picked the following players as
Albany's All-opponent team:
Forward—Jack Potter—~Plattsburgh
Forward—Ron Davis~—Oswego
Center—Don Perrelli—New Haven
Guard—Jerry Large—Buffalo
Guard—Jack Madden—Rider

Of the five listed, Potter was
named to the Oswego State College
Invitation Tournament A 1 l - S ta r
ﬁrst team along with Large of
Buffalo. Davis was the most valu-
able playcr in the tournament.
IIonay Captain

By a unanimous vote among the
players. Gary Holway was elected
captain of next year's squad. Hol-
way added 421 points to his two
year total of 983 for a new three
year college record of 1404. Along
with his scoring, the Pcd ace pulled
down 281 rebounds.

The outgoing captains Don Mayer
and Dick Causey contributed game
averages of 11.1 and 4.3, respectively.
Fail To Reach (‘cntury

For the ﬁrst time in three seasons.
the Pcds failed to hit the century
mark in any of its games. The
highest .«ingle game point total
produced was against Pace College,
94. It was against the same team
two years ago, that the Pods scored
119 points for the Page Hall record.
Oh. well, we’ll settle for more of
those 17-5 records or better.
