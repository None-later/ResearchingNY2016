By DAVID FELDMAN

—From The Octagon, Elmira College
Student: What did you say in class

Professor: Nothing.
Student: Of course, but how did
you express it this tin ‘?

-—From The Duke Chronicle. Duke U.
One student to another walking
out of a test room: You mean that
was an open book test? And all this
time I thought I was cheating.

—From The Citadel, Orange County

Community College.

Some people have concrete opin-
ions — thorough’y mixed and per-
manently set. Don‘t start any
vast projects with half vast ideas.

Yeh, like Senate investigations for
instance!

—From The McGill Daily, McGill U.
First golfer on the moon is he,
Yet mad enough to pop.

Because of lack of gravity,
The poor guy’s putt won't drop.

-—From The Crimson and White,

The Milne School.

Question: If you were to will
Milne something, what would you
leave?

(For obvious reasons the stu-
dents’ names will be omitted.)

Ans: Better teachers.

Ans.: Better looking teacher:

Too bad we lose.

—From The Echo, Alfred U.

Mrs. Harriet Maxwell Conversey
was the first white woman to be-
come an Indian Chief.

Is nothing sacred any more?

—From The Delaware Review, Del-
aware U.

I think that I shall never see

A D as lovely as a B

Against the records of the blest.

A D comes easily and yet it isn‘t
easy to forget

D's are made by fools like me

But only God can make a B.

Have you ever heard of turning a.
cell block into a ceramic shop or
a locker room into a kitchen? Have
you ever realiy seen a filthy old
basement turned into a HOUSE
BEAUTIFUL game room? These are
just a couple of the amazing trans-
formations that took placc when the
third precinct station became the
NEW Clinton Square Neighborhood
House.

Undcr the able direction of a small
staff of full time soeial workers. the
settlement house has become the
thriving center of activity for the
children in the North Broad my and
Clinton Ave. section of Albany. The
activities which thc Neighborhood
House sponsors, 'ary from inter—
plctativc dancing to swimming. Vol-
untccr loaders direct games and
clubs for the 4-6 year old “Jack '11
Jills" as wel as "Rock 'n Rollin'”
it with thc tccn agc :antccn. At the
scttll'mcnt housc, the children are
fed lunch. diverted by clubs, crafts
and sports, and entertained with
movies, danccs and would-be tutor-
ing- sessions.

When Ncig’hborhood House moved

mands on the leaders. Members of
SMILES have been volunteering
their services, but more are required
to fill the greatest need which the
children have—someone to show in-
tcrest in them.

In May they are holding their
first “Open House.‘ As part of the
program. a group of little girls is
interpreting through dance, “The
Growth of the Neighborhood House."
The (lance begins with littc girls
ll "seed costumes," progressing to
green-clad sprouts “searching for
sunlight." and concludes with bud-
ding flowers. Although the Ncigh-
borhood House troup doesn't realize
what it is thcy're interpreting, we do.
It‘s Wonderful to see the signs of
suz'h a mctnmorphosis.
