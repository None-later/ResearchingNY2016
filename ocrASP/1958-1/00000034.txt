Attention Mr. and Mrs. State Collegell This is not a
syndicated column. This is not even the entire opinion
of the State College News. Some of it is, however, but
most comes from my mind. I am supposed to write sports,
but at the present time, there is more serious business at

hand.
Indoor Sports

For some time now, there has been a bit of “intra-
mural” bickering going on about the News. Some of it
is well taken, but the whole thing is now a big, superfious
mess. Senate has put its resolution on record, and for the
present, no more will come of it. By the time Senate acted
on the resolution, the entire item was dead in the main
sense. The subject was brought to a head in the last News
Board meeting and discussed. I took the dissenting Side
as to the then present qualities of the paper. I was not
laughed at for my opinion about the condition of the News,
nor has there been a complete lack of‘ effort to clean up
the “allegations.” Yes, a lot more could be done, but I
believe that with all the “to-do" about whether the paper

has an “open mind" or not

has been carried too far. I

could have brought up many points at Wednesday nights
Senate meeting, but I felt it best to leave personalities out
of the discussion which President felt should center only

on the proposed allegations.

I feel that the News will improve in the future, espe—
cially as its members improve their journalistic abilities.
The Senate resolution will not have a tremendous effect
on the present News Board, but it could be a detriment to

future boards.

It is, however,

passed and will make pres—

ent members think twice before printing certain “repul-

sive” items.

Hoop League Nears Finish;
Mau Maus, VIP's Victorious

At the present time the AMIA
intra-mural basketball leagues are
in their closing stages of competi-
tion. The connnissioners of basket-
ball have set up a tournament to

the program.

The tournament is being run as
a double elimination, with the win-
ner 0f the losers' bracket playing
the winner of the winners’ bracket
for the undisputed championship of’
the AMIA league of hoopsters.

Ped Keg/ers
Lose To HVTI;
Bibbins Scores

State’s varsity keglers dropped
Tuesday night's match to HVTI by
a score of 3-1. Although Bruce Bib-
bins turned a 536 total and Joe
Swierzowski finished with a 515 to-
tal featuring a 208 high game for
State, the Hudson Valley boys were
able to field a better team. The high
game for HV'I‘I of 219 was recorded
by Gordon Grant. A 212 by Bill
Handy also contributed to State's
defeat.

The Peds seemed to roll more con-
sistently than did their opponents.
Dick Pardec‘s 191-157-156 exempli—
fits this, while Dave Wickert for
HVTI dropped from his 212 first
game to 117 in the second. Also for
State, Irv Peterson turned in a 448
total and Keith Kemipton shoded a
435 tally.

Hudson Valley took their first
point by beating the Peds, 867-774, in
the ﬁrst game. They continued to win
by out-totaling State. 871 to 802, in
the fo.1owing contest. The third
game brought out State’s only point.
The totals showed 862 for State to
810 for HVTI. The final point went
to Hudson Valley for the most to-
tal wood: 2548-2438.

Baseball Practice Starts;
Squad Appears Strong

Twenty~five persons and several
holdouts made the first week of
practice a happy one as Coach Dick
Sauers. expressing pleasure over
the turnout, put his varsity base-
ball hopefuls through a week of
conditioning in preparation for the
April 19 opener at Bleecker. The
Feds are slated to meet Utica in a
3:00 game on the home diamond.
Pitching Holds Success Key

Pitching will play a big part in
the Fed rejuvenation pans as co-
captain Howie Caldwell, an Albany
boy who last season broke a wrist-
hone in the first days of the cam—
paign, looks strong and should find
an able battery mate in the form of
a returning catcher and two new-
comers. The returnce is Tony Cor—
cclla, a second man to Bob Grana—
dos last year, who may well be
backed up by a pair of freshmen
who look good so far.

Co-captain Wes Brown, who was
growing strong in the mound duties
as the season drew to a close last
spring. will return in this position.
()thcr returnees include Wendell
Fowler, Tom Bricrly, Ray Havcr,

With a nucleus of the returning
men and an encouraging turnout—

Dick Sauers stated, his main objec-
tive will be to bund a strong infield.

staff will help," he added as an
afterthought, “but any pitching

Opportunity i
For Tennis

Evcr since a track team was at-
tempted three y ‘lll‘S ago, there has
been a hidden desire to increase our

Now with the chance to do so
staring the "Pancho Gonzaleses" of
Stutc College in the face, it remains
only for the interest to be uncover-
cd.

Sign-Up Sheet

It was annountcd this week that
a sign-up sheet will be posted on
the AMIA bulletin board for all
those interested in tennis to sign,
provided that enough make the
move, the bid to put tennis on a
varsity plane will come before AA
Board Wednesday. In order to show
the Board that the interest is not
merely one of getting one’s name
posted, it is suggcsted that as many
as possible who want to improve
our sports program, appear at that
