STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY. MARCH 21. 1958

Cabinet Considers Greeks,
Queen, Campus Commission

By DAVID FOTHERINGHAM

The Cabinet is now meeting twice
a week, hoping to accomplish twice
as much.

Fraternities Reprimanded

The Greeks were stoned nicely as
Don Beardon reported on the action
taken by I.F‘.C. against those
naughty boys who raised too much
heck. All fraternities must now
turn in pledging procedures to I.F.C.
for approval. Violators will be force-
fully disciplined. What will this do
to all of those careful'y guarded se-
crets? A monumental step indeed.

Our State Beauty

Are we to elect another Campus
Queen? This question remained un-
answered as the Cabinet considered
the criteria suggested for a state-
wide campus queen in the Platts-
burg letter. John Yager sounded
the ministers for their opinions on
the respective importance of beau-
ty, scholarship. character and per-
sonality, and extra-curricular activ-
i ies. Minna Podber felt that talent
should be added to the listi?). Don
McClain wants beauty to be the
main consideration. Perhaps we
should limit voting to men only!
Then the wheels real'y turned when
the question of scholarship arose.
——2.0. 2.5, or what? Will “queeny”
stumble. stutter and fail without the
proper scholastic background? And.
how much extra-curricular activity
is needed to give our beauty repre-
sentative a collegiate air? At any
rate. the Cabinet has to suggest
sometiing to Plattsburg. but what
that may be is still uncertain, ex-
cept that the criteria are worthy
enough. The final status of these
nebulus concepts will be known in
April and then, Statesmen, you will
have your chance. By that time,
popularity polls will be numerous.
some with prizes.

Clean Up The Slums Movement

Carol Scheu reported on the pro-
gress of Campus Commission revi-
sions. What the Cabinet has to do
with this is questionable, since the
Senate has exclusive authority over
the Constitution and rules of the
Commission. But President Yager
wants the Cabinet to recommend
policy, so on with the show. The
happy merry-go-round started again
as 0.0. continues to enumerate de-
tailed rules Of conduct—no necking,
clean your cafeteria, hang up coats.
strict mailbox rules, etc., etc., etc.

The intent was accepted. especial-
ly by Minna Podber. who says the
Draper Lounge looks like a stable.
She did not comment on the Com—
mons or Cafe. King wanted the no-
smoking rules included and enforc-
lcislHSEven the faculty smoke in the

The penalties are strict. Three
warnings and you lose an activity
on your activity card. (But the fac—
uity doesn't have activity cards.)
Further sets of threes can get a rec-
ommendation for suspension from
college.

Everyone except Grace Nesbitt
agreed that these rules are too pica-
yune and unenforceable. Yager
wants CC. to have more discretion-
ary powers. Nesbitt says a Clean-
L‘p-the-Campus-Week is the answer.
The rules went back unapproved.

Senator Introduces Amendment
Lowering Presidential Average

By RICHARD KENDALL

Attention all second-guessers and
Cafeteria quarterbacks: the inevit-
able has happened—an amendment
was introduced in Student Senate
wnich will lower the academic re-
quirements of the SA President and
Veep from the present 2.5 average to
a less restrictive 2.3 index. This coup
de maitre was offered Wednesday
night by fresh Senator Donato, and
it should prove quite interesting
when the Senate discusses the pro-
posal after the Easter vacation,

Earlier in the evening the Senate
heard a report from Dick Eisner on
the proceedings and accomplish-
incnts oi' last week‘s Education Con—
icrcncc. On the proceedings: the
(oininittcc which considered the
problems and functions of college
SLUiit'IIL g-,.vei'iiiiieiits arrived at scy-
ci'ul provocative (a euphemism for
"iibsurd"i conclusions. For instance:
iiic student government is rcspon-
:iblc for fostering an air of intol-
ii‘i'tlllliily in the college iconiiiiciit:
onc double inverted tl‘iillsllilstilllti-
iitcd Bronx checri. And again: stu-

dent committees, which. we assume.
are well known to be astute judges
of the subjects they are attempting
to learn (ceiiiment: two words. only
one of which would get by the
Morals Squad».

The Senate exhibited some nimble
maneuvering as it moved into the
Parliamentary iiiinbus called "as—if-
iii the committee of the Whole" to
discuss an appropriation of $135.00
from the “Big Foui' Fund" to pro—
iide the Statesmen with transporta-
tion to an Alumni meeting in New
York City. In lees time than it takes
to light a Pall Mall from either end.
the Senate slipped out of the "us-if-
in. etc." on a motion by Senator
Wiitsoii-~~so quickly, in fact, that
Vcop Ncsbiii was .cft juggling the
g'uvcl and copies of the appropria-
tion bill, which were belatedly distri-
i.uicd to thc Senate to constitute
ihc rcziuircd third reading. Need-
