 Ecclesiastics Plan Meetings;

Cabinet Members Suggest
Keys For Myskania Only

By DAVID FOTHERINGHAM

It looks like Myskania wiu keep
its key-line in the budget. Connie
Ollvo defended the line at last Fri-
day's Cabinet meeting, contending
that Myskania is still a tradition
from the alumni point of view, and
Myskania members should be given
recognition. Many Cabinet members
wanted other groups, such as Stu-
dent Union Board, to have keys for
recognition. Others saw no sense in
any key lines. The result—the Cab-
inet Will recommend only a Mys-
kania key-line.

IFG

International Film Group was
called in the carpet by John Yager,
who could see no difference between
IFG and the Friday Fi.m Group be-
cause the officers of the two groups
are identical. He also wanted to
know what happens to the surplus
collected on Fridays. Beverly Rahn
and Steve Jacobson pointed out that
all surpluses of the Friday Group
go into an account handled by the
Faculty-Student Association and
are used to improve the equipment
and facilities of the program. They
also reminded Mr. Yager that the
Senate allowed the group to organ-
ize autonomously and lent money
to them, which is now paid back.
Still unwiling to concede, Yager
asked Winnie Youngs to investigate
further. It seems that Mr. Yager
wants SA to control a group which
is already operating very satisfac-
torily on its own under FSA guid-
ance.

There was only one meeting of
the Cabinet this week, since they
had a dinner meeting with the ad-
ministration yesterday to discuss
the role of Student Government, the
exchange program, summer finances,
etc. This is the first meeting of its
kind under the new regime.
Attempt To Curb!

Mr. Yager criticized this column-
ist for the comments offered. Yager
thinks everything should pass

through the Cabinet before appear-
ing on the Senate floor. This is fine
when in the administrative process
the Cabinet wants to recommend ac-
tion to the Senate, as in budgets,
etc., but, once an issue is in the
hands of the Senate, the Cabinet
does not have the duty to take over
investigations. Campus Commission
was made responsible to the Sen-
ate, as was the temporary Rivalry
Committee.

In recommending legislation. the
Cabinet does not have the power to
direct legislation. These duties were
sharply separated. By leaving the
Senate almost unorganized as it is.
and initiating out of the Cabinet,
the Senate is becoming a rubber-
stamp outfit, debating off the top
of the hat, with few facts to back
their decisions. Objectivity and leg-
islative leadership on the Senate's
part can be lost as a result — and
where does that leave representative
government?

Kampf Komments:

 

  

Tennis, Bowling . g. ..
And That's All 

Meanwhile back in the sports world . . . Four tenta-
tive opponents, Oneonta, Potsdam, New Paltz, and Siena
appear to be sufﬁcient to get the proposed tennis club off
on the right foot. Twenty-two racket men posted their
names as being interested in putting the “sport of Kings"
into work and as soon as presidential action is taken, we
can guarantee plenty of court action. There is little need
for stating that the initial interest will have to last this
time; all upperclassmen know what happened when track
was attempted. Plenty of names appeared on the sign-up
sheet, but the personage failed to appear for practice. . . .
A word to male bowlers interested in the Eastern Inter—
collegiate Individual Match Game Championships—the
sports desk is in receipt of an entry blank for the tourna—
ment to be held at the Bowlmor Recreation Center in New
York City . . . If interested, contact this writer via student
mail . . . Entry blanks must be postmarked no later than
April 20. . . . Predictions for the majors this year—Chicago
White Sox and St. Louis Cardinals to square off in the
World Series. . . .

With this, the last issue of the News before Easter
vacation, Kampf Komments comes to a close to make way
for fresh talent. It is my sincere wish that whomever the
News Board elects as my successor will be able to reach
those goals for which I have striven. My policy over the
past year and a half has been to give each sport its equal
share of space according to the allotment given me by the
Advertising Editor.

CHEVY’S NEW V8 LEVELS
THE HIGHEST, HARDEST
HIGHWAY OVER THE ANDES!

To prove the durability of Chev—
rolet's radical new Turbo—Thrust
V8,* the tremendous flexibility of
the new Turboglide transmission,*
the incredible smoothness of Full
Coil suspension, we tackled the most
challenging transcontinental road in
the world —— the l,OOO-mile General
San Martin Highway. To make it
harder, the Automobile Club of
Argentina sealed the hood shut at
Buenos Aires —— no chance to add

oil or water or adjust carburetors
for high altitude.

So the run began —— across the
blazing Argentine pampas, into the
ramparts of the forbidding Andes.
Up and up the road climbed, almost
Pi miles in the sky! Drivers
yispod for oxygen at 12,572 feet ——
but the Turbo—Thrust V8 never
sinckoncd its torrent of power, the
Full Coil springs smothered every
bump, the inrboglide transmission
mode play of grades up to 30
percent. Then a plunge to the
Pacific at Valparaiso, Chile, a
quiuk turn—around and back again.
Timo for the round trip: 41 hours
14 minutes —— and the engine was
never turned off!

Potter, Vets Bid For Crown;

 Forfeits Mar Hoop Slate

The elimination tournament for
the AMIA intramural basketball
league is in its filial stage with two
teams being eligible for the cham-
pionship. The two remaining squads,
Potter Club and the Vets, are sched-

Tennis To Take

On Club Status

Athletic Advisory Board met Wed-
nesday and Thursday of this week
to discuss among other things, the
possiblity of starting tennis on a
varsity club basis.

.iction came after
twenty - two undergraduates had
signed their nanws to the sheet
posted on the AMIA bulletin board.

AA Board 's

The present position of tennis is
resting on finding means to support
the club. Under AA Board rules, a
sport must first go through a club
basis period before becoming a var-
sity level sport. Before it can reach
club status, there must be some sort
of tournament p‘.iy for a few sea-
sons to determine the interest. Ten-
nis has passed that stage and will
go on a club basis this spring as
soon as President Collins approves
it.

On last Wednesday night Potter

man for Potter was Sandy Bem-
stein with 20 points. Don Nolan and
Skip Gebhardt rang up 13 points
each to pace the losers.

with 25 points .ind was also high
scorer for the two games of the
week.

l"orfeits Mark Action

During the past week these were
the only two contests to be played
out of the seven which were sched-
uled. Mid—term exams and a tight
schedule interfered with each oth-
er and the result was a string of
forfeits.

They are listed as follows: Cadets
forfeited to Vets and the Vets to
Potter Club in their first scheduled
meeting. The VIP's forfeited to BE?
and EEP to the Mau Mans. The Man
Maus forfeited to the Vets in their
second game. This leaves Potter
Club and the Vets as the only can-
didates for the first two positions.
