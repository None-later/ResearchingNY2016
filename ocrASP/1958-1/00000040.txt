FIRST DAY: Saddled my cat and
rode home to White Plains on his
back. Had a flat paw on the Thru-
way. Took him to service station in
White Plains and had him changed
to a dog.

SECOND: Was very noisy at
home. Locked myself in bathroom
to escape noise and start. homework.
No good.

THIRD: Locked myself in closet
to escape noise and start homework.
No good.

FOURTH: Locked myself in re-
l'i'igcrator to escape noise and start
homework. No good.

FIFTH: Locked myself in freezer
to escape homework and start noise.
Changed to an ice cube.

SIXTH: Was thrown into a glass
lull of scotch. Was good. Lost track
of next five days.

TWELFTH: On the twelfth day
of Easter my true-love. gave to me:
ten unread books, six dirty looks;
two bloodshot eyes, four obscene
cries. and a foo—bird in a pear tree.

With all the homework I had to
put off during Easter, I didn't even
have time for the nervous break—
down I had been planning. For five
weeks before vacation started I had
been scriniping and saving, making
every second and every penny count
so that when the time came I could
arord my nervous breakdown and

LANA TURNER: And this. John-
nv Darling, is my daughter — Do

'lhose of you who don't read the
Hearst papers ~ you go right on
thinking that I'm a nice guy and
that the world is good. Those of you
\\ ho are hip to my dirty little jun-
ior-high-school mind probably as-
sume. that I have nought to do each
day but sit around conceiving inor-
bid jokes that aren't even funny.
Well you’re very wrong ~ I have
plenty of other things to do. All I
actually do, however, is sit around
conceiving morbid jokes that aren't
even funny. But I have plenty of
other, worthwhile things to do. And
someday I‘ll do themmas soon as
I run out of morbid jokes that aren‘t
r okay. Uncle Lionel wherever you
are, enough is enough.

Wonton—Soup Dept.

Anyway, there I was last Friday
rating almond cookies in a swank
Chinese restaurant in New York,
when this grubby little kid breaks
past the cashier and holds an even

grubhier nickel up to the head-
waiter.
“You got anything in here for

it is much?" he asks.

It‘s a. good thing that my date
didn‘t hear the question. or she
would have dropped her jello right
in the soy sauce trying to catch
the big spender from the East be-
fore the headwaiter gave him the
boot. And after paying the check,
I would have glady sold my soul to
the little devil for his grubby nickel.
Good time to sell, you know; re-
cession and all.

Well, the kid went away with his
nickel and a distrust for anybody
not American. As for me. a half-
hour later I was hungry again, and
I forgot all about the Orient and its
iiiiibassadors and bought two “bet-
you-finish-do-its" at a soda foun-
tain. And I‘ll bet you know what a
lie that is and whut I really did the
rest of the evening.

State Association Specifies
Requirements For Teachers

At a recent meeting sponsored by
the siudent chapter of the New
York State Teachers' Association,
Dr. Edgar Flinton, Director of
Graduate Studies, answered ques-
tions concerning teacher certifica-
ticn in this state. The session be-
gan with an explanation of the
provisional certificate and continu-
ed to requirements for permanent
certification and master‘s degree.

Provisional Certification

At the end of four years of ade-
quate preparation. a teacher may
be granted a provisional certificate
which is valid for five years if he
continues in his training toward
pcnnuncni certification with an av-
erage yearly increase of six hours.
The four years of preparation in-

cludes eighteen hours of profes-
sional courses with methods and
student tcuching. The minimum

number of hours required in the

 

l allocate allow/4

A special student committee met
with the Beta Zeta faculty this
\\t‘£‘k to discuss student-faculty re-
lationships. according to Sally Har—
ier ‘58. President of Beta Zeta. The
girls outlined various areas of so-
rority interests and invited the fac-
ulty to join them in these areas.

The sorority placed a call to Lissa
Silva. last year's foreiin student
frcm Mexico and a member of Beta
Zeta. to offer their best wishes upon
her engagement.

Gamma Kappa Phi

Gamma Kappa will hold an Open
House for R.P.I., Sunday, asserts
Judy Swan '58, President. Beverly
Petcoff '58 is chairman.
Phi Delta

Lillian Meaders has been initi-
ated as a member of Phi Delta.
states Patricia Gearing '58, Presi-
dent.

The

Recession

academic major varies, but generally
they are as follows: English — 24
hours; Modern Language—18 hours;
Math—18 hours; Citizenship Edu-
catin—Zl hours. The sciences are
treated separately. Commerce is
c'assed as a special field similar to
Agriculture. Music, and Home Eco-
nomics and has slightly different
requiremcnts for certification.

Permanent Certification

Permanent certification requires
30 hours of graduate study above
the provisional certification re-
quircnients. Although the master’s
degree may be taken for the 39
hours. it is not necessary for certi—
ficatiin; 30 hours of courses ap-
proved by the State Education De-
partment are sufficient. Usually the
selection of the 30 hours includes
at least 9 hours in the major field,
9 hours in general education (fields
outside the major) and 6 hours of
professional education.

Once a teacher has earned per-
vnanent certification. he has ten
years in which to complete 6 addi-
:irnal hours approved by the state
department. Commerce teachers
earn a provisional certificate which
is valid for 10 years. Thirty hours
of unspecified courses are required
following that period, but there is
no limit on the time required for
their completion.

Minor Certification

In order to be certified in his
minor. a teacher must have taken
a methods course in that field. The
exception is that one methods
course serves all Modern Foreign
Language and one course serves all
fields in Science. Also a teacher
may teach one class in a subject
outside his field.
