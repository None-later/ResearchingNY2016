Name-The-Quartet Contest!
Solve Problem For Singers

About a month ago four boys
from State got together to see if
they were compatible. vocally that
is. The results were amazing. The
boys thought that they had some-
thing and those of you who heard
them sing at the Concert at Page
Hall for Parents’ Weekend know
that they do. And now we have
something. They are a new State
College Quartet. and like the college
they attend. they are very progres-
sive.

Contest
But. alas. they are without a
name and need one desperately.

Run a contest in the paper was the
answer to their problem. What
could be more appreciated than to
have State College students name
their own quartet. The quartet

thought the contest would be a
wonderful idea and have decided to
save some of their beer money for a
prize to the lucky person who wins
the Name-The-Quartet Contest.
The prize will be a crisp, new five-
dollar bill.
Rules

Here's all you have to do: Think
of a name and send it along with
your own name through student
mail to one of the judges, which are.
of course, the members of the
quartet, They are Dick Robinson ‘61,
lst Tenor; Joseph Kahnle ’59, 2nd
Tenor; Robert Helwig, Baritone;
and Donald Loopman, Bass; Helwig
and Loopman are Sophomores.

The contest will run from April
21 to May 2. The name of the win-
ner will be posted.
