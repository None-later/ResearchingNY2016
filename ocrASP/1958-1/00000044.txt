By JOHN QUIRK

This past Monday found throngs
of people milling ’round the Art
Gallery to view the labors of Arnold
Herstand, Assistant Professor at
Colgate University. The oohh's.
aaaa's and what-is-it’s mixed nice-
ly with the refreshments that were
on hand for the occasion. and art
had entrenched itself still further
in the thoughts of those on- campus.

Mr. Bel-stand

Mr. Herstand. a painter in the
Abstract Expressionist school, has a
good array of works, principally
oils, etchings and woodblocks.

“The Voyage"

“The Voyage" is a veiy ﬁne
painting showing to good advan-
tage the artist's concern with ren-
dering in a seemingly loosely con-
ceived manner, a powerful painting
of positive, yet diverse shapes. His
mastery of color dominates this, as
it does the majority of his other
works. What at first glance seems
too loose to stand the stares of
close scrutiny, falls nicely into place

as it is studied further. Mr. Her-
stand has also submitted a group
of etchings and a sketch of this
same scene for the show.

“Gutted Building”

“Gutted Building" is another
painting that is again highlighted
by the artist's highly personalized
style. In this painting, particularly
do we find him reducing through
color the prespective of his subject
matter. A woodblock done in red
and black, which hangs next to the
oil is another excellent rendition of
the same subject. The above works
are well worth seeing and noting
in the show.

My purpose is not to wear the
show out with an exhaustive an—
aiysis of the works in it. but to
highlight some of the works and
advise you to hury on up to the
Gallery and catch an excellent ex—
hibit that has been footnoted nicely
by an introductory plaque found on
the wal just as you enter the gallery.
Many than-ks to the efforts of Mr.
C.

Peds To Meet New Paltz Diamondmen Tomorrow

By DAVE MILLER

With a week of practice behind
it, State’s varsity baseball team will
carry its 1-0 record into the trip
tomorrow to New Paltz, where the
Feds meet the Hudson River squad
in a. two o'clock game. The same
crew lost twice last season to the
Sauersmen in their annual pair of
encounters.

The Conquering Hero

Hero cf the big 2-0 win over
Utica last Saturday was big Pete
Spina. a newcomer to the pitching
staff, who countered fits of wildness
with brilliant pitching en route to
a 10 strikeout. two hit performance.
The tight pitching duel was broken
up in the fifth when the key blow
was struck by Dick Lewis, a Free-
port. Long Island, boy who tripled
to bat in Ken Brett. Brett had ac-
quired first via the free pass route.
Some Tight ’l‘imes

Lewis himself scored on Gunder-
man's deep fly which was hobbled
by the centerfielde" for a three base
error. Another big turn came in the
seventh when Spina. who had a
no-hitter going until that time. gave
up a hit to the opposing pitcher but
retired the side harmlessly. Twice
he struck out the side to escape
bases-loaded jams. once in the first
and once in the third. In six other
