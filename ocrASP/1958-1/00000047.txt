Hos’r Pla’rlsburg Today

BY DAVE MILLER

The all-around basketball cham-
pionship trophy was won by Beta
Zeta, the Thursday night champs,
(5-0 record) against the Tuesday
night champs, Kappa Delta, (6—1).
High scorer was BZ's Joan Nole,
with 12 points. This is BZ’s second
basketball trophy in succession, and
Kappa Delta's first bid for final
honors.

Attention racquet enthusiasts and
golf hopefuls! It has been an-
nonuced from AMIA that arrange-
ments have been completed for both
golf and tennis tournaments.

The golf tourney will be held on
the Albany Municipal cow‘se. A11
undergraduates are invited to come
out as long as all divots are re~
placed. The tennis matches are not
open to varsity players but all
others are again urged to come out
and try their luck. The tourney will
be conducted on a match play basis
with no qualifying rounds. Sign-up
sheets for both sports are on the
AMIA bulletin board.

Eight girls from State attending
a Playday at New Paltz state
Teacher’s College, held Saturday,
April 26, came back with honors for
Albany. The .prbgram consisted of
various field and indoor sports, with
Albany State girls taking top place
in bowling, and volleyball. The day
culminated with a tour of the
campus.

. Softball

The annual Spring Spree is sched-
uled for May 17. A bus will be
ready to drive the girls to Camp
Johnson early that morning. Ac-
tivities planned are a work party
and varied recreational games. A
sign-up sheet will be placed on the
WAA bulletin board.

Softball games played during
both the afternoon and evening this
week, will continue on the same
schedule next week. Watch the
bulletin board for time.

Volleyball season begins next
week; games on tap Tuesdays and
Thursdays in Page Gym.

Recent election of WAA Publicity
Director went to Arlene Luick.

Managers are reminded to hand
in the accumulated hours for both
team and groups sports.

A round of golf, you say? Nine
roles? But what course? Dorm
field?! Strange, you say -- oh,
but can be done.

Begin in front of Pierce Hall.
Now, you’re at the first water
drain—it's that square cement
thing that sticks up with the
metal top. You're shooting for
the drain with your CLUB.

Now that you've reached the
second drain, you’re ready to go
to third. Accomplish this and
you can move to . . . home plate
of the softball diamond.

From home to second—differ-
ent. eh! At this point you’re
ready to try for the BIG "hole."
Aim for the large white trash
can on Brubacher’s terrace.

The seventh and last hole is
a challenge—hit your hollow lit-
tle ball around the corner of
the game room and onto the
little cement stoop. BUT—you
must avoid the water hazard,
MUD.

Yes, we did say nine holes.
It's simple; repeat your first
two and you're done. Par for
the course is Ell—good luck!

 

State's undefeated baseball squad
will gun for its third win of the
young season this afternoon after
being thwarted twice in the past
week by the weather. The Feds face
Plattsburg at 3 pm. on a field to he
named on Friday morning and
posted in the commons.

On Tuesday the ballplaycrs turned
plans for their third win into a
ninety-mile luncheon jaunt as the
rains washed out any feeble hope
of playing by the time game time
rolled around. The same rain made
the field at Hawkins stadium un-
playable and forced postponement
of Wednesday's tiff with Sieiia to
Monday at 2 pm. in Hawkins sta-
dium.

Spina In Control

Hero of the 16-2 drubbing of New
Paltz was Pete Spina, who fanned
eleven over seven innings and dis-
played vastly improved control in
not giving up a walk until the
seventh.

Spina received some timely aid at
the plate, however. as Ken Brett
and Dick Lewis both cacked home
runs, Brett crashing his in for three
markers and Lewis for two. Lewis
also slugng a pair of triples to
score three times and drive in two
runs. The big right hander is bat—
ting .444 so far this season.

Lewis was matched for plate
fireworks by Howie Caldwell who
also hit three for six, but in the
form of two singles and a double,
to score once and drive in two rims.
He is batting an even .300 in the
two games so far. The team batted
slightly over .343 in the New Paltz
game and has batted .261 for the
season.

Gunderman Triples

Also good for a run was Larry
Gunderman who collected his first
hit of the season when he poked a
long triple that tell just short of
home run territory in the seventh.

Another ball player to take ad-
vantage of the batting practice in
the New Paltv. apple orchard was
Ray Havcr, who singled and doubled
in four official trips to the plate.

Loose Fielding
And Tough Spirit

 

By JACK LEWIS

As the Intramural softball leagues are now in full
swing we would like to present our introductions and

predictions for some of the
seen action thus far.
Pogos Show Strength

prominent teams that have

Captained by Gary Holway of basketball fame the
Pogos have shown themselves to be a tremendously im-
proved team. Pitcher, Pete Talfar who returned from the
service to resume his hurling activities has thus far
thwarted all opposition with his tremendous speed and

control. He has been backed

up by the consistent hitting

of Joe Hickey, Tom HOppey and Sandy Bernstein who
occupy third base, left ﬁeld and center respectively. Holway
is situated in right ﬁeld and Don Beardon, Don Nolan and
Ed Gifford ﬁlling out the inﬁeld from ﬁrst base to short-
stop. Doug McDougald has been taking care of the vital
catching duties. To date the Pogos have achieved ﬁrst

place by defeating both the

SLS and Potter squads and

seem determined to remain undefeated.

the squat position behind the plate and the inﬁeld is being

covered by Jack Tate, Jack

Beardon, Harry Millet, and

Dick Causey in their respective positions from ﬁrst to
third. Setting up shOp in the outﬁeld at left and right are
Wayne Harvey and Jim McGrath with either Backer or

Call ﬁlling in at center.

The men from State Street have

had to rely on their powerful bats since they have been
continually jinxed by loose ﬁelding.

With the existing evidence at hand we will have to
say that the Pogos appear to be the likely candidates for
tOp honors in the Albany League.

Netters Defeat New Paltz,

State's fledgling nctmcn received
a baptism under fire this week as
the courts at New Paltz were the
scene of a 9—0 drubbing of the New

fore the home courts proved lcss

8-1 decision to visiting Slcnii.

Kappa Beta Takes S’ra’re Loop Edge;
Pogos Zero SLS 9-0, In Albany Race

BY BOB KAMI’F

Rain dampened the AMIA intra-
mural softball schedule this week,
but seven games were played in
between the intermittent showers.

Albany League action was
limited to one game as the Pogos
took possession of first place with
a 9—0 triumph over SLS. The
weather put a damper on the APA-
Pogos game as well as the SLS-
Potter tilt.

KB Runs Rampant

In the State League, Kappa Beta's
“dark horse" squad managed to get
in two games and won them both.
The Rousers fell, 19-1, Friday. and
EEP was vanquished, 9-3, Wednes-
day as the Betanien made it three in
a low. In a. game similar to last
year‘s marathons, the Vets emerged
victorious, 28-27, over the Rousers
who have lost three in succession.
One other game between EEP and

  

IN OR ()lT'l‘.
races to beat throw to ﬁrst,

rain caused only one State League
postponement between the Vets and
Apaches.

Union Heights and Ridge moved
into a first place tie with the Jok-
ers in the Teachers League with
victories over the Leftovers and the
Kobras, respectively. Union Heights
nipped the Leftovers, 9-7, while
Ridge took a 19-14 victory.

Protest Awarded

The Apaches won their protest
when it was decided that an
umpirc‘s decision was wrong. Ed
Jones of the Apaches was on third
base representing the tying run with
EEP leading, 7-6, in the sixth
the Apaches ended in protest. The

Jones broke for the plate and scored,

played from the sixth inning.

KB is well on its way to the
State League pennant with its three
straight resounding victories. The
Washington Avenue fraternity men
are as sharp as knives in their
fielding. playing errorless ball
against EEP. Their hitting has
been an outstanding team effort,
and their pitching has allowed only
five runs in three games. Only the
Vets are pressing them at the mo-
ment.
