Traditions, Frosh Weekend
Stimulate Cabinet Discussion

By DAVID FOTHERINGHAM

Traditions and Rivalry were the
topics discussed at the meeting of
the Cabinet with the Administra-
tion last Monday. Connie Olivo gave
her report on the present plans for
next year‘s Freshman Weekend,
which promises to be a very effec-
tive program. Both men and women
will be on Campus, and all 650 frosh
will be there. It is hoped that the
frosh will get the feeling of the
many traditions while the weekend
progresses.

Rivalry

How Rivalry can keep the ball
rolling is still the unanswered ques-
tion. First of all, what are tradi-
tions? Is rivalry part of traditions
or is it something completely differ—
ent? Can the new Rivalry plan re-
organize and interest the freshmen?
Traditions

Don McClain as Minister of Trad-
itions will now have to draw up a
list of traditions as they now exist
at State. It was suggested that some
new traditions could be started to
give new life to our traditions. But,
there must be many old traditions
lying around that we don't know
about or trouble ourselves to learn.
There are many subtle traditions.
such as the proper way to address
professors. All of these points led
the Cabinet to the conclusion that
it must learn these things and pass
them on to the upperclassmen be-
fore it can expect the freshmen to
pick them up.

Socializing At State

The Program of Rivalry brought
up many questions. How many
dances should be held diu'ing Riv-
alry? Is dancing such a good instru-
ment for meeting people and de-
veloping class spirit? It still must
be decided when the Beanie Ball
will be held.

And Rivalry Again . . .

Is the Kangaroo Court a good
idea? Can such a creation, even in
an informal setting. keep the fresh-

men support, or should it just be
an all out three-week campaign by
the Sophomores? Of course, this is
the essential element in any Rivalry
program the upperclassmen
must support this program and keep
a positive attitude, and keep the
freshmen jumping, or the whole
thing will fail as it did this year.
After all, it’s only three weeks long.
"that should be long enough to meet
the fresh without developing a Riv-
alry 0f bitterness rather than one
of friendliness.

Religious Clubs
Slate Activities

Charming Club has scheduled a
meeting Sunday evening at 7 p.m. in
Chanm‘ng Hall of the Unitarian
Church (across Washington Avenue
from Draper Annex). Dr. Joseph R.
Sander, Executive Secretary of the
State Board of Examiners of Psy-
chologists, will speak on “The Phil-
c-sophy of Humanism." At 8 p.m.
the group will participate in a meet-
ing of the Albany Humanist Chap-
ter. Albert Camus's book “The Fall
will be discussed.

Hillel

A 10x and bagel breakfast is
planned for Sunday morning, an-
nounced Amelia Podber '59, Presi-
dent of Hillel. The breakfast will be
held at Ohav Sholom Synagogue
from 9:30 to 11:30 am. It will com-
memorate Israel’s tenth anniver-
sary.

Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship

Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship
will meet Thursday in Brubacher
Hall at 7:30 p.m. This meeting will
be under the direction of Ellen Mc-
Laughlin ’58. Miss Janet Traver, a
bio-chemist at Sterling-Winthrop
Research Institute. will speak on the
topic of “The Tabernacle."

Gym Program
For Freshmen

A11 freshmen should be delighted
to learn of the decision from Oscar
E. Lanford, Dean of the College,

concerning p h y s i c a 1 education
courses.
No Soph Classes

It will be impossible to offer

Sophomore physical education
courses next year because if limit-
ations of both staff and facilities.
Therefore the requirement for the
Class of 1961 will consist of two
semesters of physical education if
satisfactorily completed.

Juniors Exempt

Students in the present Junior
class who have not completed re-
quired courses in Sophomore gym as
of yet will be excused from it. How—
ever they must have completed two
semesters of freshman physical ed-
ucation unless excused by the Med-
ical Office or as a result of veterans‘
status before graduation.

No statement can be made for
members of the Class of 1960 who
have not completed Sophomore gym
except that these students will not
be able to take these courses next
year.

Commuters Club
Picnics In Park

Commuters' Club is planning a
picnic at Thacher Park, Sunday,
May 18. This will be their main
spring event, announces Michael
DeBonis ‘59, President. Chairman of
the affair is Pauline Oathout '61.
The cost, one dollar, covers food.
Car Pools

Transportation will be provided in
the form of car pools. They will
leave at 1 p.m. from Albany, Sche-
nectady, and Troy.

Committees

Sign-up sheets for working on
committees are posted on the club

1958

 

By DAVID

Here is a little pertinent piece
of information from the Bucknel-
lian, “A whale breathes through the
top of its head.” Sorta makes you
stop and think.

From the same paper: “Whoever
said ‘gasoline and alcohol don’t
mix?’ He must have been real
stupid. Who would pour alcohol in
his gas tank?" Yeah, at at least $3.75
a fifth.

This is a little note from The
lieacon, Lansingburgh High paper.
“A Texan visiting Australia saw u
kangaroo for the first time and
drawled, ‘Ah‘ll grant you one thing
for sure; your grasshoppers are big-
ger than ours'!" Pretty cute for
high school kids, huh? Well I
thought so.

And finally, here is a late scoop!

Gene Cassidy. Rary Fitzpatrick‘s
fiance (she says), from Union.
(College, that is) has recently been
elected the President of the Student
Body there. She said that I had to
put this in the paper and after all
she is the editor and if I want to

FELDMAN

stay . . . Oh well. apologies to those
who read newspapers for news, but
a job is a job.

Honor Society
Plans Banquet

Pi Gamma Mu, Social Studies
Honor Society, will hold its initia-
tion banquet Tuesday, according to
Robert Kopecek '58. President. The
banquet will take place at the Uni—
varsity Club at 6:30 p.m.

Tickets

Tickets can be purchased from
Margaret McNeill '58. Treasurer, or
from Catherine Newbold, Assistant

Newbold‘s officc.

Morris Berger. Associate Profes-
sor of Education, will be the main
speaker. After dinner new mem-
bers will be formally initiated.
