Today marks the very probable
curl of a landmark at State Col-
lege. This is the last “Open Mind“
you will ever read, for I am quite
through with it, and I would put
a ouick stop to any lesser person
with the audacity to take my place.
Today I am writing about you——
and me. It would be foolish of you
not to read the entire column.

State College is an unusual place
admirable academically—— but with
an unusual personality. As any stu-
dent talks with you, he will tell you
that cxccpt for you and him. therc
isn't a person worth expectornting
i'pon in the entire school. I‘ve spok-
cn with many people other than
'you and him" and strangely
enough. they do consider themselves,
at the very least, a worthy target.
of cxpectoration. Where. oh where.
i say. are the unworthy ones? I‘ve
yet to hear anyone say, “Yes, I am
(110 of those who make State Col-
lege miserable." It is little wonder,
then. that when I count the people
here I get two—thousand. and yet
when I count faccs I get twice that
number.

State College is a place with a
disparate need for someone like
myself—and I say that with un-
abashed pride. It is much like a
child who. having been quenched
with drinks of artificial color and
flavor all of his life, feels a need
for something real, something fresh,
something stimulating, something
as bright and inviting as an orange
ready to burst in the sun. But
when the child learns that oranges
cost more than a nickel, he rcturns
to his rose—colored liquids with an
uncanny antagonism for oranges.

And tints I came to State and
wrotc columns that Wci‘c oranges,
and behaved in u lll‘dlllli‘l’ i thought

plnycd noisy piano. and said dirty
things. and paintcd wcird picturcs

truth about myself.

torted op-en-mindedness and indiv-
idualism. From literature I learned
the beauty of the true individual.
And mOst important, from the ques-
tioning of my own soul, I discovered
the need to release with sincere ex-
pression the jumbled, twisted, com—
plex. macabre tangle that is one's
Sell. And this is what I stand for-
the release of the Self by me and
by you, and the reception of one
airithcr‘s selves. as understanding
and complete as it can be. This
stand is as old as time, for essenti-
ally it. is—truth.

Generally, although you have mis-
interpreted my columns, you have
enjoyed them, and given me pleas-
ure in the knowledge of such. Your
patience with my haul columns —
amt there. were many—was more
than gcncrous. Your interest in the
columns and the individual behind
them—even if misdirected—was en-
couraging.

As a group screaming its head off
about nothing in particular in the
union. the commons. or the cafe—
tcriu, State College is a rather hor-
riblc thing. But when I consider
the same entity man for man: wo-
man for woman, I realize more
wannth, friendship. and tattcmptedi
understanding than I have realized
or ever will realize in any other
large group in the world.

that has brought much of the hum-
or into this weary old world. It
seems that everybody has his own
particular way of defining terms
to suit his own needs and many a
smile has been the result of a neat-
ly worded definition.

Even when Samuel Johnson first
brought out his dictionary many of
his definitions were not exactly of
the standard variety. We have some
definitions that have ample applica-
tion among the students at old Ni-
agara University.

Egotist —— a conceited fool who
thinks he knows as much as you do.

Tact—what a guy has when he
won't change his mind, but can
change the subject.

Parent—the kin you love to touch.

Chivalry—the attitude of a col-
lege boy to someone else's steady.

Tomorrow—today‘s greatest labor-
saving device.

Pedestrian—a man whose son beat
him to the garage.

Balanced Budgctv—when the days
of the month and your money run
out at the same time.

Again from N. U.

"We made a trip to Europe during
the Easter vacation and were fortu-
nate enough to pick up a few puns
from avid column readers who were
touring the Continent at the time.
We must credit the first column to
a poverty stricken lord who related
it to us while sitting in his castle
in Lnncastershire.

Sir Launcelot had recently pur-

was greatly admired by the mem-
bers of the Round Table and especi-
ally King Arthur. “Launce,” he ask-
ed. “how much did: you pay for the
suit?" “Three cents an ounce," re-
plied the knight. “Isn’t that expen-
sive?", asked the sovereign. “Oh no,"
replied Launcelot, “this is first-class
mail."

The other pun refers to armor
also.

A midget came to a costume party
dressed in a suit of armor and rid-
ing a huge Great Dane. Not having
an invitation he was summarily ush-
ered to the exit but the host relent-
ed and permitted the midget to stay
after the midget had inquired—

‘BUT SIR, YOU WOULDN'T
TURN A KNIGHT OUT ON A DOG
LIKE THIS?’ ”
