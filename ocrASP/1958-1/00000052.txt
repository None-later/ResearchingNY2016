Cabinet: ’

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY, MAY 9. 1958

ﬂnjiters Dis‘cusspippikill; '
Total Budget Jumps $4000

By DAVID FOTHERINGHAM

Moving-up Day is still an unset—
tled issue. It opened again at last
Monday's Cabinet meeting: Should
we wear hats and carry canes? Mc-
Clain will bring the whole issue up
to a class meeting. To be or not
to be an issue of the State College
News for MUD?

Higher Budgets

Budgets are now ready to be
presented to the Senate. As pro-
posed, next year’s budget will be
$39,481, compared to last year’s
$35,000. It is interesting to note
that with the additional grants
from surplus, last year’s total costs
were around $38,000. Noteable in-
creases were allotted to Music
Council Guest Artists, $1500; State
College News. $400: Pedagogue,
$1100. The Senate will probably
come down quite a bit, as the con-
troversy over the camp grows.

Ditch Dippe

The same question—Do we need
a college camp? Should we hold
off on appropriations for a. while?
Should we try to sell? The long-
range plans not yet put into motion
were cited. DeNike, Yager and Cass
were very sure it can be built up
and interest the students, but they
were aware of the distance factor.
Yager felt there too much of a
negative attitude toward the camp.
No one realizes the potentialities,
nor will they enjoy this realization
because it is too far in the future.
If we don‘t keep going we'll lose
what tax we've already paid.

There was still a question as to
whether or not there wasn't a bet-
ter use for the money. Therefore,
the budget is being held and a large
meeting will be called next Friday
to deal with the problem. Myskania,
the Cabinet, the Presidents of the
sororities and the fraternities and
Commerce Club, Senate and the ad-

ﬂaw”.er

ministration will all meet in the
conclave.
New Budget

The appropriations which were
taken from surplus for special oc-
casions are now under a Special
Days Budget of $1200, a time saving
consolidation.
Foreign Students

Foreign students in this whole
area will gather at a dance here
next Friday, wi‘h entertainment, a
movie on Venezuela, etc. About 100
are expected from SCT. Let’s hope
more show up.

Junior Class Bzuiquet will be on

Where's the bomb shelter? Do
you have a laminated ID card?
Save it. There will be no more.

 

0n [gazing ﬂame

Buy a carton of milk, pour it
on your ulcer, straighten your
horn rims, and sit down and
read this bitter article.

Wellington Weekends are in
full swing, and scraps of brass
and glass are being thrown
around like so many scraps of
brass and glass. Little girls get
carried away and suddenly ﬁnd
themselves linked to guys who
they trapped into paying for
their rooms. Of course the con-
verse is also true, and unsus-
pecting males occasionally wake
up minus one piece of jewelry.

Somtimes it all works out, but
usually the girl gets sick of
wearing black sweaters and the
guy just plain forgets. Sooner
or later, rarely never. the safety
catch slips and the girl goes
back to wearing white blouses
and the guy tosses the trinket
back into his already cluttered
dresser drawer.

All in all, it's quite a game.
Some win, some lose.

 

Frosh Names Song Group;

Call Them ‘The Ascots' Now!

Francis Fleck, ’61 has earned five
dollars with her winning name “The
Ascots" in the quartet-in-a-quan-
dary contest.

The new quartet was featured two
weeks ago in the News as a singing
group of State students in search
of a name and Willing to pay five
dollars to obtain one.

Pourg‘uoi Aseots

The name “Ascots” abbreviates
Albany State College for Teachers
in a pronouncable, pleasant—sound-
ing manner. In the way of informa-
tion, as ascot is a wide. napkin-like
tie (usually with a diamond stick-
pin). and the Ascot Racing Downs
in England is an elite gathering
place as well as the subject of a
tune in “My Fair Lady.”

The Group

The group, reviewed last week by
Art Plotnik in “The Open Mind," 1

led by Richard Robinson, '61.

includes Joseph Kahnle, ’59, Donald
Loopman, and Robert Helwig, Soph-

JDramatics & Arts Council

To Present "The Marriage"

The Dramatics and Art Council
will present the State College
Theatre production of Nikolai Go-
gol’s bright comedy, The Marriage
May 16 and 1'7 in- Page Hall at 8:30
pm. Under the direction of James
M. Leonard, Assistant Professor of
English, the cast and crews have
created an evening of theatrical
tornfoolery in the tradition of farce
and burlesque.

The plot is concerned with the
manipulations of a professional
matchmaker named Madam Fyokla.
played by Adriana Warner '58. and
a self-appointed matchmaker, Kot—
chkarev. played by Charles Weed
‘60. Both are concerned with getting
their respective candidates to the
"blissful" state.

Suitors

Madam Fyokla‘s client is Miss
Agafya, played by Robin Roy '58.

for marriage to Miss Agafya, is
played by Robert Helwig ’60.

Other gentlemen in pursuit of the-
hand of Agafya are Lieutenant
Zevakin, "a man of parts,” played
by Grant Duifrin '61; Mr. Omelet,
"a prepossessing person. though fat",
by Frank Ireland ’60; and Anutch-
kin, whose “legs are as slender as
a girl's arms". by Robert Mont-
gomery ‘61. Arina. aunt to Agafya.
and champion of the merchant
class, is played by Arlecn Emery ’61.
The servants in the households are
played by Donnalee Anderson ‘60
and David Oakleaf ‘59.

The play itself is a study in atti-
tudes of ambivalence and vacilla-
tion toward getting married. The
point seems to be that marriage is.
both a greater and a lesser decision
than anyone knows. The acting
emphasizes broad chaructcrization
and “bits” of physical action of an
irnprovisatory nature.

State Crews

The imaginative setting for The
Marriage were designed by the Slatc
College Theatre Stage Manager,
John Lucas '6], who makes striking
use of line, color, and space. Under
his supervision, the members of Mr.
Leonards stagccrai‘ts class make up
the crews that construct the sets
and assist in lighting.

The heads of the various techni-
cal departments are drawn from the
membership of Dramatics and Art
Comicil. Charles Huntress heads
the lighting department; Shirley
Stone. Sophomores. costumes; Ju-
dith Dalvin '59. make-up: Kenneth
Smith ‘58. sound; and Mary Jane
Trxpis ‘60. properties.

Serving as assistant to the di-
rector is Roscmarie Sepe ’59.

After two performances in Page
hall the 16 and 17 of May. the corn-
pany and crews will travel to New
Paltz State Teachers College where
they will present The Marriage
May 19. Admission for the Albany
performance will be $1 or by stu-
dent tax. Tickets will go on sale to-
day in lower Huested.

the NEWS you now hold.

What Will Columbia Say!

“Bradley! You can't print that!"

“Lockwood, can’t you type faster?"

"McGough, THIS is a typewriter!"

“No, Fotheringham, you can't
write an editorial."

“Sneaking out, Dunham?"

“You mean you can't name the
Deans?"

. . . and this is but a. brief ac-
count of what happened in the
News Office this past week. You
see, dear reader, this literary mas-
terpiece you‘re holding in your
grubby little paws was written by
the Seniors . . . well, mostly by Sen-
iors. There are a few "guest" col-
umns written by Scuilin' Jack
tOl'lllSlJCel, Mrs. Egclston of the So-

cial Studies Department, and even '

Minerva of Rotunda fame.

But. let us give you a vivid de—
scription of what actually happen-

cd Wednesday night. It was no
trouble getting Seniors to write
this issue—the Dean made it re-
quired for graduation.

Well. to get back to the tale, Ro
Santonicola sat quietly behind one
of the filing cabinets peeking out
with her thumb a story on Movrng-
Up Day. . . . Mary Shelton l Busi-

herself as she attempted to change

Dave Fotheringham mumbled to
