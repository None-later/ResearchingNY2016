Minerva's Diary Reveals
Formerly Undisclosed Facts

By MINERVA

7:59 am. this is the college——Al—
bany State—N.Y.S.C.T. of S.U.N.Y.
Call me Minerva—goddess of wis-
dom, 4.0 average. You guessed it—
Dean's List. Woke up this morning
to the tune of the custodians'
“Campus Serenade." I was feeling
poorly—stayed up all night helping
a frantic frosh prepare for the
“Wac” test. Remember. too, a ped-
estal may be the place to perch
purple people—eaters, but . . .

8:00 am. It's that time of year
again—Graduation—a local 1-9-5-8.
Looked up my list of Seniors—came
up with a lot of mementos—wrote
them all up into an Ivy Speech. took
it to the dean; he reviewed it, put
in correct punctuation, patted me
on the helmet, said I was a good
goddess.

10:00 am. Climbed down from my
stony hideaway, sped to the cafe-
teria, gave Myrtle the word: “Cof-
fee-break." Table-hopped and dis—
cuased politics. sex and religion.
Came away with my original con-
clusions.

11:00 am. Checked the student
mall under M. Looked for a 2x4 lit—
erary effort but nothing was there.
Inspected the Steinwa", the ash

trays, and left before anyone
thought I was non-conforming.
12:00 Gilded over to Hawley and
put the finishing touches on my
term paper entitled, “Transition”
(from upper john left to rotunda
squared in one easy movement.)
G-rabbed a quick "Pabst" after the
traditional inquiry and left for the
Mayflower.

1:00 pm. Did a spot conunercial
on TV, attended a Cabinet meeting,
lectured hi Ed. 213A, checked the
schedule of the mortal I‘m hawking.
2-4 pm. Sat in on a He. 22 class—
supervised the operation of the
movie projector, took my “A” gra-
ciously. Sallicd over to Bro—stood
in cafeteria line~rcad Shelley and
Keats while waiting—“They serve
who only stand and wait—" wanted
to be more individualistic—read Sa—
linger; divided everything into
iambic pentameter, settled down to
a bowl of Irish stew.

7:00 pm. Went to Page. Watched
the MUD skit hit a home run.
Headed back to my roost in the
above and beyond, Bewitchlng hour
—Campused Standard Time. It was
a day like all days-—lt was State.
And it was typical.

8:05 pm. Case closed.

And when they thought I finally
was "open minded" enough, some
guys took me down to some “street.”
They got mad. Yea, MAD, cuz they
told me not to speak to strangers,
but I was Just havin' fun seein' old
friends I hadn't seen since I turned
conventional back in ’54. I took a
motorcycle home. Nice policeman!

Oh, don’t get shook. There‘s no
message here. But I’m reserved.
And, well, what do you want? Wis-
dciin? Advice? Blood? Gossip?——yea,
yea. See that’s what I mean. Gripe!
Gripe! Gripe! That's all I ever do,
I mean that's all I ever hear.

Just one more thing. Invite par-
ents to the beer party. The beer
will last longer and then they can
stay all the rest of the week and

Sedentary
State?

By JOHN STEFANO
Page Hall, Soccer & Softball Fields, And All That!

It seems very disgusting that a college run by the
great State of New York should have such inept athletic
facilities as we have here in Albany. Granted the recent

. Bond Issue passed by the citizens of this State will provide
funds, eventually, for athletic facilities here at the college.
It seems, however, that this matter could have been taken
"care of much earlier. If some hearsay is correct concerning
this matter then construction on new facilities should have

,started 2 or 3 years ago with some of it being completed
before June, 1958.

The only new items we have to look at around our
“campus” are the Washington Avenue tennis courts and
-the cleared land which resulted from the tearing down of
Albany State’s “College Heights." The facilities that are
still landmarks around the college area are: (1) Page Hall
(Orchestra Pit) Gym, (2) Beverwyck and Page Fields, (3)
Bleeker Stadium. These areas are either inadequate, con-
gested, or otherwise inconvient for many of our athletic
events, both varsity and intramural.

It is apparent that the Bond Issue will provide ade-
quate funds, we hope, for new athletic facilities, but why is
it that institutions of this nature have to wait for such
a great period of time before necessities of this nature are
provided? It seems as though the State of New York
would try to cut some of their red tape to see that edu-
cational institutions have the proper facilities to develop
students physically as well as mentally. Here's hoping that
when some of the grads return for a Homecoming Week-
end within the next 5 years they will see some changes
around our “campus”—here‘s hOping' that a couple changes

. to the better may be seen concerning the college‘s athletic
facilities.

Do You Remember)?

. . . Harry Millett’s grand slam in the Rivalry softball

- game of 1954—(Harry's ﬁrst home run at State . . .) State‘s
J.V. beating A.B.C. during 54—55 season—only time we‘ve
ever beaten them . . . Backer leading Potter to 3 straight
softball championships . . Brierly leading ‘58 to a 19-0
victory over the Class of ’59. Tom’s ability at the quarter—
back slot also led the Club to two successive football cham-
pionships with Kordziel, Morgan, and others holding at
47he line. . . . Sloand, Gropp, Pryor, Legault, and Swiskey

" leading the SL8 football team to many of their victories.
. . . We also remember the feats of such people as Maxon,
Harvey, Bosomworth, Causey, Mayer, Caldwell and Dave
“Billy” Burroughs who added much to the athletic events
’during 4 years at Albany State.

Peds Close Season With Road Trip;
Drop Home Finale In 10 Innings, 9-8

By DAVID MILLER

Albany’s baseball Peds, paced by the big bats of Ray
Haver, Ken Brett, Dick Lewis, and Larry Gunderman, head
into the home stretch of the season today when the squad
hops across the River to RPI for a 4:30 game before making
the treck to Danbury tomorrow and to Oneonta on Mem-
orial day. The Oneonta trip will be the ﬁnale of the season
that thus far has seen the Sauersmen score six victories
while dropping ﬁve, the latest being a ten-inning loss to

Softball Teams
End Schedule;
S/ate Play-Offs

Since the last issue of the paper
the teams in the intramural softball
leagues have continued to battle
furiously for their respective crowns.

In View of the games reported in
ill." past weeks We find that. the
Pogos are still way out front in the
fiist. league and the SL8 squad has

:ult of two defeats at the hands of
Potter Club, 3—0 and 5-4. Last week
SLS vanquished the APA club 19-8
with u home-run by pitcher Jack
()rmsbcc highlighting the action.
This further insured APA's last posi-
tion in the first league. Orinsbcc has
done an excellent job of pitching
two SLS games in the ppast week
with a brokcn finger.

The playoff games in the first
league began this week with the
Potter Club-SLS contest in which
ilic men from State St. were again
\ictorius, 3—2. The outstanding plays
included Harry Millet‘s home-run
and an excellent relief pitching job
by Bob Backer who entered in the
fifth lllllill.’.’,‘ and with three men on
base, retired the side with .1
sii'ikcoui. This may well have saved
the game for the Potter squad.
Thus, discounting the playoffs, the
first league has emerged from the
scaSon as predicted with the Pogos
and Potter Club now in first and
second place being followed by
SLS and APA respectively.

In the second league the Apaches
seem to have dominated the action
as far as the number of games is
concerned. On last Friday they
garncrcd their sole win by rolling
ilic Rousers, 14-6. A home—run by
Ed Joncs followed by Bob Kampf's
four bugger highlighted the action.
Kcith Kciiipton batted four for four
to hpr kccp thc bascs occupied. On
Saturday they met defeat at the
hands of ilic KB squad, 7-6. A
hoinc-run in thc lust inning by
Bump i.uVullc cnabicd KB to re—

Ofﬁcial statistics for the ﬁrst nine games, which do
not include the loss to Oneonta or the 11—6 win over Platts-
burg last Saturday, show Ray Haver to be the team leader
in batting with eight bingles in twenty-eight trips to the
plate for a 286 average; Lewis is 14 points below this with
272. Lewis leads the team in RBI’s with eight, followed by
, , , Howie Caldwell (seven) and Haver’s six. Ken Brett, who

dEidweii Shines

The 8-9 loss to Oneonta could be
summed up by a pair of innings in
which the visitors got the breaks
while the Peds did not. The winning
run pushed across in the tenth nul-
liﬁed a good pitching performance
by Caldwell, who came in as a re-
liever anti absorbed the less, and
also batted three for ﬁve.

Lefty Pete Spina. the Long Island
sensation who started the game, left
in the seventh inning after a medi-
ocre performance-liis ﬁrst since be-
ing plagued by a sore arm which
cost him the game on successive
losses to Siena and Union. He is
now four wins and two losses in the
record books.

The win in thc Plattsburg game
went to Wes Brown, a righthander
who absorbed a tough loss on un—
earned runs in his only other start,
He allowed eight hits in his seven
inning stint before yielding to Cald-
well who held the Cards scoreless
and hitless to wrap up the win for
Wes. Brown also helped his own
cause by singling and doubling for
two hits in three trips and four
RBI's.

Infield Info: Ray Haver and Con-
nie Schmidt are tied for the lead
in base stealing with four apiece.
. . . Haver owns the lead also in runs
scored and walks . . . Lewis has 19
of the former and nine of the latter
. . . he has also had more times at
bat. . , Larry Gunderinan and Kent
Brett, arc the only two regulars who
still have pcrfcct fielding averages.
