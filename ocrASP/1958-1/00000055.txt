Student Senate Hearing Packs In Crow
Close  Deerinines ate Of

MARILYN G. LEACH

On Wednesday eve, a local phe—
nomena occurred when Senate per-
formed before a packed house!
There was standing room only as
the audience anticipated the night‘s

drama. “The Primness of the
the Primer.

There was a slight rustle
among the crowd with the late

entrance of Art Plotnik. editor-in-
chief of the Primer. Plotnik sub-
mitted a letter to the Senate which

apologized for what was a mis-
judgement in taste, and requested
EC copies for himself.

The question before the Senate
was what to do with the copies of
Primer not yet distributed. Jim
Dougherty's solution to the problem
was to withhold these copies from
circulation. This motion was de-
feated 13-12 with 3 abstentions. Dis-
cussion was long with much audi—
ence participation. When it ap—

Latest Statistics Show State
College Fashion Preferences

What is Joe College of Albany
State wearing this spring? Accord-
ing to a survey tabulated by Don-
ald Mayer and R. J. Banfield.
Seniors, Joe and his female counter-
part have shown a preference for
"ample. practical clothes" and a
"neat and conservative appearance."

What the Men Wear

Statistics Show that ninety per
c‘nt of the men at State wear white
shirts for dress. Fifty-five per cent
wear no he. Only thirty-five per-
cent of those observed were button
t.o‘.vn collars.
’l he Sport (.‘oai

One hundred sixty out of tWo
hundred men vvcrc without sports
coats, while eight percent WUI‘B suits,

Eighty-one percent of our boys
prefer to go without sweaters. while
the rest wear crew necks, v-necks
and cardigans,

Khakis captured the attention of

the observers; they have a sixty—
seven percent majority over black,
brown and check slacks.

The Distaf‘f Side

On the better-looking side of
the campus. we find dresses and
skirts and blouses in competition.

Full—skirted dresses lead the race
comprising fifty percent of the
taste of State's girls. The modren
chemise had only attracted three
out of one hundred seventy-one
inns on the day the survey was
.iiken

Point of interest:
percent preferred high neckllnes,
lifty favored solid colors, and
ninety percent wore cotton dresses.

Pleated. gathered and goer
skirts are more popular on cam-
].us than straight or wrap arounds.

425 to 171 skirts are preferred
over dresses. One last note 12:3 out

of 17.3 girls \vcar bangs!

peared that many observers were
only at Senate for a show and
possibly a farce, Yager quite forci—
bly put discussion back in place. A
show of non-senators showed that
at least 95": of those present wanted
Primer to be distributed.

The second scene opened with a
motion by Don Donate to distribute
copies of the literary magazine to
S. A. members only, and that this
distribution should not be inter-
preted as either Senate approval or
disapproval of this edition of
Primer.

Interestingly enough, when the
curtain fell on a rather mild per-
formance, the audience didn't
bother to see the next bill of fare.
As Yager announced discussion of
a possible constitution change, the
mass exodus to the snack bar
drowned out his speech.

It seems that this flash audience
valued a play of personalities more
than discussion of our constitution
—good taste?

The present accumulative 2,?)
academic average requirement for
S. A. presidential candidate came
under fire again with a proposed
constitutional amendment that S. A.
president may not be on academic
probation at the time of his elec-
tion. This attempt to change the
constitution was quite vehemently
discussed with the same worn argu-
ments. Ex—Myskie member Blob Ko-
pccek. did point out that the Sena-
tors were considcring this motion
with themselves in mind, but that
thc majority of voters would look at
the qualifications of a candidate.
not “who” he is. When the merry-
go-rouiid of argument stopped, the
constitution emerged victorious. and
the motion was defeated

d. Collegians Discuss Question

Concerning Camp Budget

By ROBERT KOPECEK

Senators, Camp Board members,
the College administration, and a
very few interested students gath-
ered in Page Hall last Friday to
discuss the budget of Camp Dippi-
kill. The alleged purpose of this
meeting was to have camp board
explain to Student Association their
proposed budget of eight thousand
uo.iars, however the major part of
the meeting" was devoted to a
rather undirected discussion of" the
purposes and uses of the proposed
camp.

The anti-camp bloc asked many
questions which can be synthesized
into one premise—why have a col-
lege camp? To answer this question
the pro-camp contingent tried to
impress upon the meeting that a
inaJor.ty of students get very little
out of the present S. A. budget and
that if the Camp could be devel-
oped it is believed that a great seg—
ment of these students could find
uses for it. The anti-camp bloc
asked another question——why have
the college camp? BecatiSe in its
present undeveloped state about
a hundred different students used
and enjoyed the camp this year,
was the answer. The cons next asked
President Collins if the Student As-
sociation could sell the camp site.
and the President answered that it
was the students' camp!

Finally, the anti-group proposed
that it might be a wise course not to
appropriate any money to the camp
for one year and let. the camp use
this period to gether interest. One
of the senators adequately stated
the folly of this proposal—the ques-
tion of the camp must he met.

Seniors Bid
Last Farewell

By JACK OltMSBEE
Aftcr recovering from an exam
induced hate period. we can. if
given to such things, indulge our
sciitimcnialities in a nostalgic
period dedicated to the soon-to—
grziiiuatc "Grand Old Seniors."

’lne hallowed halls of ivy take on
it warmer g.ow at graduation time,
and I suppose a few tears Will help
diffuse that glow, help soften the
ivyless bricks. and dull the sheen
of success. the glint of pride of ac-
complishment that each Senior
shows. Its very proper to be wist-
ful and a little sad at graduation
time, but a great deal of sadness’
moisture comes from strained eyes.
Underclassmen are stronger though;
its not they who have to go, there's
still pleasant time left for them,
and fewer upperclass examples next
year to set them examples.

Seniors have to say goodby too.
They bid underclassnien flip or
poigniiant farewells. depending on
the underclassman‘s sex. Tiny
phrase heartfelt goodbyes to iii-
stiuctors who have A-graded them,
nodding casually to those who
didn’t. The cold. cold world looms
larger when they bid Minerva's
academic protection goodbye, iii—
structoi's pay students in grades.
dcans ni ithiCC, but School Boards
,ay money.

Some 01 the nicest people I know
are Seniors and I shall hate to
see them go. To whom then shall
I turn for uiiaskcd advice, wasteful
shortcuts, and profitless mistakes?
I shall have to turn to myself. and
in my turn do these things for any
lilltllfl‘ClthlllCil who might ask ol'
inc thc questions I did of Seniors.

Actually, Sciiiors are not the
i.isc i make against them. and be«
:ltli's, thcrc's nothing they can do
about their being Seniors. Somcbody
