STATE COLLEGE NEWS, SATURDAY.

 

,4 Jam, 0,; was

By ANNE KING

Moving-Up Day was founded in
1914 by the Senior Class. The first
program included an address by the
President of the College. Dr. Bru-
bacher, class speakers, moving-up,
and the college sing.

Mrs. Brimmer, class of 1900, re-
members that they had a program
held in the chapel that was similar
to our MUD. but it did not have
that title. Only men were allowed
to appear on the platform at the
ceremonies.

Minerva’s Doin’ It

There is a discrepancy in dates.
In the college literary magazine, the
Echo, in 1912, appeared this com-
ment: “Moving-Up Day was a suc-
cess. It seems to be a custom which
is now permanently established.”
Minerva was quoted in the same is-
sue as saying. “Everybody's doin’ it
Doin' what? Movin' up!" In May,
1313, a Letter Home described the
traditional dress for MUD, white
dresses for girls and caps and gowns
for tlte Seniors.

The traditions of MUD have been
accumulated over a number of
years. At first, all four classes pre-

sented stunts. The freshman and
Sophomore stunts were judged for
points in the Rivalry program, which
at that time ran during the entire
school year. In 1916, the Senior
stunt was an allegory, urging the
students to start a weekly newspap-
er. The Stnte College News was be-
gun the following year.
Class Speakers

Txe class speakers originated in
1918. That year, representatives of
the three upper classes gave
speeches on the “ideal Senior, Jun-
ior, and Sophomore.” The tradition
of “step-singing" was begun in 1919
with the Senior Farewell Song and
the moving-up of the Juniors at
the step sing. The first mention of
the planting of the ivy was made
in a News issue in 1923.
Myskania Tapping

From 1924 on, Myskania played a
major role in MUD. The tapping of
the new members provided suspense,
and was a good drawing card. This
year the class speakers have been
kept a secret from everyone. MUD
may not be what it used to be. but
it is still MUD.

"Here's
To Ro,
She's . . ."

. . . true blue. [to who? [to
Santonicola. She’s responsible
for this whole thing, you know.

Actually. we intend to be
quite serious. What [to did for
us this year is no laughing mat-
ter. MUD, as most of you know,
was a “tentative” item on our
college calendar for quite some
time. When it was finally do-
cided we would have one to
carry on tradition, [to was chos-
on as chairman. She did a ter-
rific job, as you have seen this
morning. and this evening.

So, here's to R0, she’s true
Blue, she's a .................. .. chair-
man. through and through.

While we're thanking folks,
thanks to Anne King. Rhoda
Levin, amt John Yager for their
help with this issue.

 

Sundstrand, Hoover, Vivona, Bartholomew,
Monahan Deliver Class Speeches In Page

‘Who are the four class speak-
ers?" No one seems to know! In
past years, we always knew at least
a week before Moving-Up Day. Why
the change? This year. the Senators
chose the four class speakers but
the ballots were counted by our SA
President. Even the Senators don't
know.

We thought you’d like a short
sketch of our four class speakers.
Let's start off with the fresh. When
S:naic was picking the frosh speak-
ei. they looked for someone who
would surely represent the class.
Sunny Sundstrand was their choice.
Sunny lives in Poughkcepsie, New
York and ever since she came to
State, she's been in there fighting.
You saw her at all the rivalry events
and even after her injury, she
