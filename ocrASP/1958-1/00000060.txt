By BEVERLY J. RAHN

At the end of last semester IFG
rewrote its constitution and rede-
fined its status as a campus activity.
The need for a general reorganiza-
tion was felt early in the year,
when the enthusiastic support of
the student body guaranteed success
for the new Friday night program.
Besides scheduling problems and
budgetary questions, the query,
“When is International Film Group
going international? started the
bail rolling. Should there be one
or two groups? What name is ap-
propriate? Should Student Tax
Fund support the group?

Reorganization

Most of our troubles were grow—
ing pains and were easily alleviated.
The members decided to retain In-
ternational Film Group as a name
for one organization with a dual
function: (1) to present historic and
art films, (Zr to show popular
movies. This semester IFG will
operate independently of the Stu-
dent Tax Fund; a standard admis-
slon fee will be charged at all films
to cover expenses.

Cinema Scope

After the new cinemascope
screen is installed in Page Hall. IFG
will present films in the auditorium
in order to eliminate double show-
ing on Friday evenings. The sched-
ule includes several cinemascope
features. an experiment made pos-
sible by our new lens.
New Features

Tonight in Draper 349 at 7 and
8:30 pm. IFG will present “On the
Riviera,” a zany musical comedy in
which Danny Kaye plays the dual
role of a French lover and an
American entertainer. Kaye ex-
hibits his extraordinary skill at
pantomime and also does some im-
personations of Maurice Chevalier.
Sir Harry Lauder, and Jimmy Dur-
ante. Working with a troupe of
Jack Cole dancers, Kaye performs
an amusing number entitled. “Popo
the Puppet," and actually is sus-
pended by ropes like Howdy Doody
and Pinocchio. His actions are con—
trolled by eight puppeteers. who
employ a system of counter-balance
weights to operate the ropes which

direct the performers.
