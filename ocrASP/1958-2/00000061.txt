Something Old . . .

Once upon a time, a marvelous panacea was derived
to improve the efﬁciency of our student government. For
years people have been screaming that the political big
wheels could not do justice to their student teaching and
the various activities in which they participated without
shirking one or the other.

And so it was decided by the elders that January-to-
January elections (held in February incidentally) would
solve this problem. Of course, implicit in this plan is the
idea that in order for it to be successful the political big-
wigs should do their practice teaching third or fourth
quarter and leave the ﬁrst semester open to carry out the
responsibilities which they accepted when they took ofﬁce.

Unfortunately, this is not the case. It must be obvious
to the freshmen who attended the government convocation
last week that there were some people of prominence miss-
ing from the ranks. The blithe explanation given was
that these ofﬁcers were off to pre-student—teaching confer-
ences and were about to embark to points unknown the
following day. Cabinet was perhaps the most poorly repre-
sented group there since it consisted of two pe0p1e where
once there were ten. With about ﬁve cabinet members
gone this quarter it looks as if our meetings are going
to be quite cozy. We will no longer have to meet in an
activities room; a closet will sufﬁce.

If we sound bitter and annoyed it is because we are.
True, some ofﬁcers have to teach ﬁrst semester, but the
majority do not. The administration has always gone out
of their way to help students with a real need to adjust
their schedules so that their academic requirements and
other responsibilities may both be met.

It is too late to do anything about it this year, but
certainly the Juniors who will be elected this February
have a duty to the student body to arrange their student
teaching for the last seine.r r of their Senior year. For
the efﬁciency and the continuity of government this is a
serious obligation, and one which we hope will not be dis-
missed in the future.

Something New . . .

Last Wednesday, Senate appointed Nancy McGowan
to ﬁll the Junior vacancy in that esteemed body. This
editorial should not be construed as a crusade against
Miss McGowan, but rather in the way she rose to fame
and fortune. Wasn’t there more than one person who was
qualiﬁed for the position? Only one name was brought
up for the vacancy on Senate—and, incidentally, for lab
assistant in the mimeograph room.

True, this is only a temporary appointment but it
should be pointed out that Miss McGowan will have an
obvious advantage over her opponents in the November
replacement elections due to her appointment. Was it so
momentous to the well-being of Senate that the ofﬁce be
ﬁlled immediately? We’ve had openings before and the
Senate managed to struggle on.

And one last question: upon reading the constitution
we ﬁnd nothing under the duties and powers of Senate
that approximates this action—~50 where does the consti—
tutionality of this appointment rest?

Something Nice . . .

One of the disadvantages of being the mistress of cere-
monies at an event you have chairmanned is the obvious
fact you can't congratulate yourself on the wonderful
job you did. This is unfortunately the case of Terry
Kerwin who was chairman of the All—College Reception
last Saturday night. Naturally the State College News
would not let this oversight go by for another minute.
The job Terry (lid was great as was the showy—and she
deserves a very hearty thank you for her fine job.

Since it has become the vogue to
open each new column with an
apology. we are forced to also add
ours, for being such talented writers.
Let's face it gang—this paper doesn't
deserve us.

MADISON

Bridge on the River Kwai—This
stirring civil war drama stars Alec
Guinness as Rhet Butler, with Wil—
liam Holden as Orville Faubus. A
fast moving melodrama ﬁlmed on
Formosa in blazing inonocolor. This
movie was taken from the best sell-
ing novel, Every Day is Christmas
by Sherman Adams.

LELAND

Operation Madball—This movie is
an example of the rubbish which
theaters will be forced to show
when they run out of thrilling teen-
age monster spectaculars.

The second feature Decision at
Sun Down has played to the cock-
roaches in leading movie houses all
across the country.

PALACE
Harry Black and the Tiger—
Stewart, Granger babbles his way

through this ﬁrst class loser with

the grace and poise of a fully
equipped deep sea diver. Second

smash flop is The Missouri Traveler.
The papers say “this is your kind
of movie about your kind of guy".
Thay now. We have seen better
plots than this on TV at Milne.

Now that registration lines have been beaten back, we find that a
new offensive has opened in the Co-op. After standing in line for three
days. we ﬁnally got through the door only to find that the books we
wanted were "fresh out." For $.79 we could purchase an assignment book
to write down the work we are unable to do, and a ruler-wielding
sentinel carefully guarding the one remaining pile of books for a course
called "Introduction to College."

Pic-rushing is oil to a good start amid the peace and serenity oi
the cafeteria and student union. From the bottom of inotiiball boxes
have sprung sweatshirts, jackets and other paraphernalia typical of the
true spirit of the Greeks. Girls return to the dorms nonchalantly shout-
ing sorority songs, Men get locked in lavatorles with fresh men. Even
new faculty members are invited to "get to know" these organizations.
Fraternities serve buffet dinners to sorority girls. Sororities invite men
for coffee at one o'clock. We understand that there is a movement
izilout to send Nelson a bid if he wins in November.

By DOUGLAS A. PENFIELD

On June 16 at 10 am. the T. S.
Empire State III embarked on its
annual training voyage into the
great unknown. Aboard the ship
were 4.50 cadets, fifty crew members,
and ten guest students from the dif-
ferent State Teachers Colleges
around New York State, yours truly
being one of the latter. representing
Albany State.

We. meaning the ten special stu-
dents, were chosen by means of an
essay contest and other qualifying
requirements to represent our rc-
spcctive colleges. While on the ship
we would live with the cutlets and
work with them while they were
performing the duties necessary for
tile upkeep of the ship.

Afti l‘ the last. goodbye was sound-
ed, we settled down to the duties
a' hand We had a meeting with
the executive officer and I was as-
signed to Division II. Section I of
the deck crew. This meant I would
be painting, scrubbing decks, coil-
ing rope and performing many other
tasks.

After spending three hectic sail-
ing days- which included a little
work, a little play and a lot of sea
sickness we finally arrived in Ber—
muda.

street.

Friday we rented a cab and took
a tour of the island. We saw such
famous spots as Elbow Beach, the
St. George Hotel, Fort St. Cather-
me. the Devil’s Hole and many other
interesting places.

 
 

Bermuda's only means of acquir-
lllL’, fresh water is through its rain—
f..ll. The roofs on the houses are
made in a stair-like formation and
oatcd with lime for purification.
The rain water is then collected off
t..e roofs by means of troughs and
stored until needed.

The ship left Bermuda on June 21,
and we arrived in Belfast, Ireland
«.11 July 3. Tom, the boy I was
traveling with, and I left the ship
at 2 pm. and thus began the ful-
filinnnt of a dream we never
flioight would come true. We were
out to see Europe, and it was up to
ii; to make the best of it.

We strolled around Belfast, and
then caught a steamer to Glasgow,
Scotland later in the evening. The
steinner docked in Glasgow at six
in the morning and we proceeded to
look around. The night before the,
Queen had been there and the
place was in somewhat of a tur-
moil. it is strictly an industrial city
with very little historical value con—
nected with it.

At 2 pm. we left for Edinburgh.
the capitol of Scotland. When we
arrived, we set up residence in the
lo ill YMCA for $1.12. or 8 shillings.
.1 night plus breakfast. The food is
iilafivcly inexpensive in the United
Kingdom and also very good.

After eating supper at the local
5 and 10, iWoolwortli‘s to be exact),
we took it walk around the city and
later in the evening went to hear
:i band perforiinince iii the park.

’lhz- next morning we took a tour
of the city and managed to get a
glimpse of t.ic Queen who was in
residence to open up the Edinburgh
holiday season. We visited Edin-
burgh Castle, the Palace of Holy-
rootihizuse where the Queen was
living, St, Giles Cathedral

sidered to be the most beautiful
