STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. SEPTEMBER 26.

 

eaten“; sticky/114

By BARBARA LeBAR

International Film Group's first
Italian film this season will be the
celebrated ROMA CI'I‘I‘A APERTA
«OPEN CITY). Produced despite
great financial and technical diffi-
culties, the picture boasts the great
talents of Roberto Rossellini and
Anna Magnani.

Financial Crises

To say there were numerous fin—
ancial crises is no exaggeration. for
it is on record that on one occa-
sion. both Rossellini and Magnani
sold all their clothes in order to
carry on production a few more
days.

The fiim deals with Italy during
the days of German occupation in
World War II. Nearly all scenes
were shot on actual location with
only Gestapo headquarters fiction-
a!i.ed. Graphic in its depiction of
torture scenes, OPEN CITY balances
its tragedy with comedy in illustrat-
in; everyday life in occupied Italy.
Atmosphere Of Rome

This was the first movie made in
liberated Italy and it had only one

purpose—to recapture as faithfully
as possible the atmosphere and in-
cidents of Rome during German 0c-
tupation with special emphasis on
the work of the Italian Resistance.

The picture stars Manfredi as the
resistance leader. with Anna Mag-
nani as his fiery betrothed. The
sensitive role of the frightened priest
who encourages others is handled by
Aldo Fabizi. Harry Feist tackles
the
chief.

Music Important

Music plays a significant part by
its very sparseness and was compos—
ed by Rossellini‘s brother. Renzo.
This and other technical devices
mark OPEN CITY as a milestone in
italian cinema. and the film is said
t.) have set the tone to future movie
production in Italy for many years.

The film's most striking feature
is its realism. This dramatic and
poignant episode seems but a brief
extract from the characters‘ com—
plete lives.

. Booklines and general dis-
order . . . professors returning with
a new slant for the aged students

. a flurry of pink slips by the
conditioned upperclassrnen and the
cretin-like eyes of 768 new faces on
campus. Yes. it has been a pretty
mixed-up week for all of us.

AND YET . . . one of the few op-
portunities for intellectual and vi-
sual stimulation was seemingly
scorned earlier in the week. It was
the reopening of the State College
Art Gallery.

An excellent show consisting of
eight oil paintings and two pencil
sketches opened for the first time
this past Monday between the hours
of 3 and 5 pm. In addition to the
show. the students and faculty had
the cpportunity to partake of a
frosty cool punch and a delectable
repast of canapes.

Artist Present

And on hand for the gala affair
was the artist himself. But where
were the people? . . . Booklines? . . .

All is not lost, though. The ex-
hibit will adorn the walls of the
gallery until October 17.

Laurels

Mr. Harry Lane, whose works are
on display. is an artist of national
reknown and is presently residing
in State Line. Massachusetts. He is
represented in the permanent col-
lections of the Metropolitan Mu—
seum. the Worcester Museum. the
Boston Fine Arts Museum, as well
as the Berkshire Museum in Pitts—
field. Murals by Mr. Lane are lo-
cated in Port Washington, New
York and Oakdale. Louisiana. He
las studied in Munich and Paris.

With an eye to the above achieve-
ments and the excellent qualities of
the works now being shown. it‘s a
must that students and faculty alike
get over to the gallery to see Mr.
Lane's work.

Technique

You'll find that while
paints representationally. his uni-
que technique with his paint ap-
p.ications and the textural delicacy
he creates imbue his work with that
structural and eye appealing some-
thing that we find so lacking in
many of our conteiiiporaries.

His choice of scenes and the ar-
tistic license he uses to advantage
gives many of his Works a "haunt-
ing unnatural quality.“ exciting the
mind‘s eye and leaving the viewer
with extremely positive feelings for
his works. 7

Mr. Lane

Thanks
A debt of gratitude is owed to
Messrs. Lane and Cowley. To the

former. our thanks for his gener-
osity in giving the college the oppor-
tunity to display such a fine group
of works.

And to Mr. Cowley. many thanks
for his efforts in procuring the
show and taking the poor initial at-
tendance in his stride. It was a bad
weci: in many respects.

Senate Defeats Amendment;
Sets Up Publications Board

By JOAN CALI

Student Senate met promptly at
7:34 pm. Wednesday evening. All
Senators were there—new Senator
was there, and oh. yes, Myskania
was also there.

Third Reading Bills

A bill calling for a constitutional
change of the freshman class under
the direction of Myskania rather
than leaving it at the discretion of
the Junior class President was de—
feated 16-12. as it demands a vote
of 19 for passage. The Senators
realized that they are devoid of
clairvoyant powers, so they are re-
signing themselves to changeless-
ness for the time being.

A second bill requiring a coni—
iiiittee composed of students and
faculty members to review publi-
cations of the College was passed.

Also. the bill to bring equipment
of AMIA. WAA and Outing Club
under the authority of the Physical
Education Department was unani-
mously passed. However. Outing
Club is still out in the colth frozen
budget. that is.

Handbook Appropriation

The appropriation of $41.96 for
the handbook was also approved by
the absent finance committee which
met last week.

Announcements

First on the announcements was
that due to such a packed social
calendar. Senate would not go to

viously planned. I

time for Dii‘pi-killing! Oh. yes. it
was the Senate who decided
wasn't it'.’
Miscellaneous

Other thoughts for the evening
included ways to keep the Minister
of Culture busy. and the status of
the Facility Student Corporation.
It appears that if you put money in
the juke box run by this corpora-
tion you may be contributing to-
ward a group house fund. But—
nowadays. houses are almost as ex-
pensive as hotels!
Proposition from Union

from the director of Union College
