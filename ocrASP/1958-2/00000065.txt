All In The Game:

Football Off
To New Start

 iii
By JACK LEWIS ‘ ‘”

The various teams finally recruited enough talent to
make the season interesting. The captains got together
to draw up the schedule at the beginning of the week
and on Tuesday afternoon a valiant few filed up to
lay out the field in preparation for the next day. How-
ever the weather seemed to have its own ideas as to when
the intramural football season was to begin. The first
game, Sayles—SLS. was postponed on Wednesday.

According to commissioner Lou Call, the gridiron
specialists will have to struggle not only against the op—
position but also with the new playing rules. The blocking
rules have been altered slightly but the biggest change
came when the ﬁeld was lengthened from 60 to 90 yards.
Better get in shape fast, men! This lengthening should
have quite an effect on the game as far as the passing
goes, since we won’t be seeing many of those one-pass
touchdowns. It should also make punting more prominent
this year. The switch from the ﬁfteen to the eighteen man
roster will have the advantage of making two platoon
playing possible.

APA Line Powerful

The APA squad. captained by Don Donato should
prove to be typically strong this year. According to Donato
the big factor will be the line with Tom Sullivan and Russ
Hall at guard, Connie Schmidt and Dick Bailey at the ends
and Donato at center. Dave Youst wil be placed as line-
backer and Bob Baker has been recruited for the quarter-
back slot. With this lineup APA is also counting on being
in on the bidding at the end of the season.

Flash! After a year‘s absence the fabulous Tumps
are back in action, captained by quick-witted quarterback,
Pete Barbageliata. The squad is again complete with uni-
forms, cheerleaders, and goof-offs. The next performance
will be on Wednesday against Potter Club who will be
ﬁghting to retain its pride. Curtain time will be 5:15.

Joe Garcia’s soccer squad seems to have beneﬁtted
from the acquisition of Franz Zwicklebauer and Carl Gert-
zenberger. two freshmen who have had previous experience
with the Albany Athletics.

Peds Drop Opener To FDU ln Rain;

State's varsity Peds. under

corked an attack that netted them
three ﬁnal period goals last Satur-
day but it was not enough as the
hooters dropped a 4-3 decision to
Fairleigh Dickinson at Bleecker
Stadium.

 

Hash In The
Cat Bucket!

By Harry the Horse

The Saratoga track was mud-
dy Saturday night when it few
of the boys came up to drop
two on my nose and I was as
nervous as a long tailed cat in
a room full of rocking chairs.

I told these guys last week
not to bet on me. but since
they were seclni,r “blue” instead
of brown they wound up losing
many greenbacks. ()ne of them
dropped a crisp twelve. another
left a double fill with the sellers
and only saw the cashier twice.
while the other played it slightly
cooler and drew two winners in
the seventh and eighth races for
0.90 and 7.80. respectively. How-
ever, he also came out behind
to the sum of one buck. It was
a bad iiin at Black Itock for the
.lim Diamonds of NYSC’I‘, but
the shell of the trotters still
holds with future meetings of
the men and mares in store.

In case you're wondering why
these stupid boxes appear in
this space. I‘m the nag that’s
runnlni,r in the Senatorial Ap-
pointment race in a few weeks.
Cheers. queers. see you at the
Tuesday gate!

the New Jersey Jinx

The game was the season opener
for the Peds. who seem to be jinxed
by New Jersey teams. The same
FDU squad last year copped a 2-1
decision and in two years Panzer
college of New Jersey has taken two
games. Frank Fallace paced the
Ped attack. scoring twice in the
Ped cause. Both goals were un-
assisted. The other Purple score
camc via a penalty kick, taken by
Carl Gertscnberger. sandwiched be-
tween Fallace's two scores.
lirancato Ilurts Peds

Big gun for the winners was Tony
Brancato. ii second year man for
FDU, who tallied twice to give the
white-shirted visitors their victory
inurgin. He scored once by the use
of his head in a literal way—and
once in the last quarter on a. screen
shot that eluded goalie Gus Tillman
and squirted into the goal after

I Garciamen Face Geneseo Tomorrow

Sloppy Soup

The game. played in an on-again.
off-again rain that soaked the ﬁeld,
was witnessed by a surprisingly good
turnout which saw the close battle
go down to the final two minutes to
be decided.

Tomorrow the Peds meet Geneseo
in a 2:30 match that marks the
renewal of old rivalries. In their
last appearance in the Fed ballyard,
the over—confident big blue men
fell victim to a. State attack that
netted a 5-0 victory in a season
opener that sent the club on to a 6
win and 3 loss record. The Knights
gained revenge in- 1957 on the
Western New Yorker's ﬁeld with a
3-1 win, but it can be stated with
authority that coach Joe Garcia
will inject vinegar into the veins
of his bail club this afternoon in
an effort to have them primed for
tomorrow’s 2:30 contest at Bleeker.
Meet RI’I Wednesday

The Peds will put on a repeat
performance at the ﬁrst mid-week
game of the season when thty meet
RPI in a 4:03 contest at Bleeker
next Wednesday. Following this the
bootei's take to the road for two
weeks.
