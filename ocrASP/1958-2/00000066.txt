8mm 

By BEVERLY J. EARN

Despite scheduling difﬁculties, In-
ternational Film Group will present
the ﬁrst film in its fall program of
popular American movies at '7 pm.
tonight in Draper 349. Voted the
best film of 1955, ON THE WATER-
FRONT received 8 awards from the
Academy of Motion Pictures Arts
and Sciences, including best actor,
best suporting actress, best director,
and best screenplay.

The ﬁlm, besides winning the
“best picture" award, also rose to
the top of virtually all “best ten"
lists of the San Francisco Film
Critics, Canadian Critics, British
Academy of Arts & Sciences, and
the National Film Board.
Outstanding Cast

Under the brilliant direction of
Elia Kazan, Marlon Brando gives a
performance which combines all the
violence and brutality of his role
in A STREETCAR NAMED DE-
SIRE with a newfound sensitivity
and human sympathy.

He gets able assistance from as
tough a bunch of hoodlums as ever
appeared in one cast. Real-life

tough guys hired for this Columbia
release include prize fighters Tony
Galento, Abe Simon, and Tami
Mauriello. The feminine lead is
played by Eva Marie Saint, who is
one of the distinguished few to
win an “Oscar” for her first screen
performance.
Film Credits

Budd Schulberg’s screenplay is
based on a series of newspaper
articles exposing racketeering in
New York Harbor unions. Photo-
graphed In the Hoboken dock areas,
ON THE WATERFRONT sustains
an impression of stark realism which
is fortiﬁed by authentic details in
tzte setting.
Love and Gore

As a tough longshoreman who
hates cops, Brando attacks the
union mobsters who are exploiting
the workers. He is joined in his
crusade by a convent-raised slum
child and a Catholic priest. Episodes
of intense physical violence and
murder are contrasted with incredi~
bly poignant scenes in a pathetically
awkward courtship.

To whom it may concern:
(Especially one particular fresh-
man boy named David, who was
standing outside of Brubacher
residence hall last Monday
morning looking very depressed
and forlorn).

On this particular morning
you were accosted by an “upper-
classman" who bellowed, “Hey
frosh, carry my books.” Let
this be a lesson to you, boy.
You can't judge a book by it’s
cover.

Nor can you judge an “upper-
classman" by the absence of her
beanie. Even though you may
have been dazzled by all that
blonde hair, this was NOT an
upperclassman. but just a fellow
frosh whose beanie was full of
mud from the tug-of-war.

You must forgive this poor,
misguided girl. She really is an
ardent freshman fan, and
wouldn’t think of betraying a
fellow frosh. But, being the
gay, fun-loving lass she is, she
just couldn’t resist the chance
to impersonate an upperclass-
man.

Hula Hoop.
Hula Hoop.
Everybody’s playing with a Hula

Hoop.

Oiu‘ topic for discussion today is
adult children's toys. The present
cause of innumerable coronaries is
the intricate little piece of American
creativity known as the hula hoop,
the wham-o, or simply, the hoop.

This amazing little circle of fun,
in the three or four short months
it has been on the market, has
taken the nation by storm. Children
gyrating in their red, blue, and yel-
low hoops force freshmen off the
sidewalks on Western Avenue; the
ﬁve o'clock cocktail set has found
a new between drink pastime; col—
lege football teams use them as cal-
isthentic equipment; Tin Pan Alley
whips up a few violent tributes to
the new American example of in-
genuity—and a few men get rich
because of a little ring of plastic!

Incidentally, the men who intro-
duced the “gyroop,” as we prefer
to call the thing, are the same men
who introduced Frisbee to the

campuses of the nation a year or
so back. Unfortunately, the frisbee
idea never spread across the nation
as rapidly as the hoop. It was
destined to be a pastime of the
educated college man and woman;
after all, it does take more intelli-
gence to throw a plastic plate than
it does to shake up a storm with a
hoop, doesn’t it?

And now, we would like to take
this opportunity to introduce to you
a new adult children’s game, un~
heard of before in this part of the
world! This new pastime is called
"Pow!" All you need is a paper bag
to start you off in the “Pow” game.
This is what you do: pick up your
brown bag, preferably a 25 1b. bag—
the kind your grocer packs food into
—blow air Into it, as you would a
balloon, and then hold it tight in
your left hand, being sure that no
air escapes from the paper bag".
Now, hold the air-filled bag out
in front of you, and with your right
hand clenched into a ﬁst, smash
into the bag. If done properly, it
will go "pow!" That‘s all there is
to it!

We heard what you said, and we
deny It. it's not stupid. It‘s not
ridiculous. At least, it‘s no more
stupid or ridiculous than hurling a
hoop around your tummy, or tossing
a plate in the air!

Pow! Pow!
Everybody's playing Pow now!
