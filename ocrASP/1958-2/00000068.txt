State's Socratic Student Says
Thought Simplicity Is Simple

By ROD ARMSTRONG and BRUCE CLARKE

While wallowing in the realms of
intellectual pursuit, too often we
lose sight of the fundamental, the
simple things that constitute the
basis of a simple, happy life and
all that jazz. We become entangled
in the Spiderweb of pedantic absurd-
ity and grow mad with frustration
at futile philosophical speculation
and other sad songs. If this is your
case. I offer a remedy . . . think
simple!

Thinking made simple is an art
by itself worthy of many volumes.
It calls for a complete rearrange—
ment of values, a reconstruction of
philosophy.

To begin you must discard certain
values and forget certain corres-
ponding vocabulary such as toler—
ance. compromise, empathy, opinion,
interpretation, and so on ad infini-
tum. In their stead you seize upon
and beat into the ground such pow-
erful and all pervading words such
as bigotry. dogma. good, bad. white,
red. and ethnocenti'ism.

The Essence of Thinking Simple

You must inculcate these values
into yourselves. allowing no others
to enter, allowing no others to be
right. You must mold these beliefs
into rigid. sturdy attitudes that will

form the frame work of a philosophy
not unlike a concrete bunker. With
this done it becomes your duty to
carry the blessings of simple think-
ing to those less fortunate. From
your impregnable philosophic bunk—
er you can attack with all the an-
swers to all questions providing they
are not ridiculously relative.

And pointing fingers of shame at
those who will not adhere. remem-
ber the immortal words of the Mar—
quis de Sade—“l may not agree with
what you say, but I will beat you
to death if you say it.”

Orchestral Groups

Music. announces that members are

By FRANK KRIVO

At the Senate meeting of the 24th.
a bill was introduced calling for the
assuming of the Junior class's
present responsibilty of organizing
the freshmen, by Myskania. This, I
think, is a good move, but I won't
go into my reasons for this but
rather. point out one of my ob-
servations that has been plagueing
me since I was Sophomore Class
President.

This bill. proposing further as-
sumption of authority by the Stu-
dent Association. ilLlIllll raised the
old question as to the need for class
governments.

(‘lass Government

First let's look at wha' class
government has done or is doing for
this college. I have been told we
have class government to “keep the
class together." I would answer
"No!" Students in the same class
are held together by common ex-
periences: fraternities, sororities.
clubs etc,

So, even if you believe that we
need class spirit. the class govern—
Incnt doesn't significantly help it.
The class does provide the iiiachin—
cry for Rivalry. Rivalry is important
btit havin; a government doesn‘t
iiecesai'ily mean it‘s needed for
Rivalry. The trosh participate
without a formal class government
during Rivalry. I have asked class
ofnccrs what, in their opinion,
their class does, One thing lllt'll-
tioiied very often was th' social
outlet. To these officers. the class
banquets and dances are llll|ItIl‘L:lll[.
I am afraid that these things are
not as important I) Inc and if
iast. year's interest In the class
banquets are of any import, neither
does the class as a whole

So. far. we would lose twi aclivi-
tics if We eliminated class govern-
ment. First. there would bi little
“class” spirit after the first two
years Ithis is actually a reality at
present». Second. we would lose per-
haps four social functions Neither

of these seem to be such terrific

losses.
Function

Students like to believe that class
goiciianit-iit prepares htlttt'dltS for
jobs in the Student Senate, Cabinet
etc. I believe this idea is Iiot founded
in fact. There can be no analogy be-
tween class government and Student
Association government

Many times a person's position in
a class enhanics his chances for a
higher office tSoph Class Picsideiu

this office does not, I repeat, does

From This Vantage Point:

 

  

Fallace Sets Record,
Zwickelbauer Aids Goal

By JIM DOUGIIER’I‘Y

     

For the ﬁrst time in many years, more people attended
a weekday soccer game than turned out for an intramural
football clash. At Wednesday‘s 4-0 lose against RPI more
than a hundred students “packed” the grandstand at
Bleecker Stadium. There were less than half that number
at the “College Athletic Field" witnessing Potter and the
Humps for AMIA laurels.

The next weekend game for the Garciamcn at Bleecker
will pit the Feds against powerful Oswego College in a
game which will highlight State‘s Homecoming Weekend.
The grads ought to have plenty to be proud of when the
Feds take the ﬁeld .as this team has the potential to be
the best at State in many years. How many of you will
be at the Homecoming Game???
Fallace Sets Record In Beating (lcncsco
In the most recent clash against Geneseo College
  ' Frankie Fallace, a sophomore from Mineola,
turned in a spectacular performance. All
four of State‘s goals were perfectly placed
shots by Fallace. Never before has any Ped
booter scored four goals in a single game.
' -, Frankie also booted in two scores against
r'ALLAoE Farleigh Dickinson in an earlier game,
Zwickelbauer Protects The Center

Coach Joe Garcia doesn‘t seem to have any problems
with the center half-back position. Franz Zwickelbauer,
a freshman from Delmar, plays the position with ability
and conﬁdence. As was witnessed in the RPI clash, Franz
protects the goal almost as much as (his Tillman. Last
season Tillman had the "Albany urchins“ to help him;
this year he has Zwickelbauer.

From The Sports Desk: (‘oach Richard Sauers carded
a 3 under par 32 on the front nine at Albany Municipal
Golf Course earlier in the month. . . Charlie Kane and
.Ioe Hill, wrestling co-captains. announce that pic-season
conditioning will commence October 13 at Bleecker. .

will pick this year’s All-Star squad. All captains are re-
quested to submit an "all-opponent“ team to this ofﬁce
by one week prior to the close of the season. . . . Anyone

So far just one week of activity
has seen four games. giving six
teams their initial action. In the
first on October 2, the Humps for-

recorded. This past Monday, the

A good game in goal was not enough
this week as RPI managed to punch four
shots past goalie Gus Tillman for a score
in each period and a 4-0 victory over Al-
bany's Feds in Bleeeker Stadium Wednes-
day. The loss was the second for the Feds
in three starts, and the second consecutive

year that the Albanians have been
shut out by the red—clad engineers
from across the river. Tillman made
ﬁfteen saves as the RPI booters
rained twenty-four shots on the
Fed goal. as compared to seven
shots by the Purple on the RPI
goal.

A fair turnout, considering the
afternoon classes and world series,
saw the contest which began to get
out of hand in the ﬁnal minutes as
the Feds attempted to break the
ice and avoid a goose-egg at the
hands of two RPI goalies who were
not kept overly busy.

Scoring for RPI and big gun in
the Engineer's attack was Sandy
Csobaji, who collected one goal and
one assist in ﬁve shots on goal.
Corky Smith for the Fed booters
also picked up an assist and goal
for the day‘s work.

Geneseo Victimized

It was quite a different story on
the same field last Saturday when
Frank Fallace. a sophomore from
Miiicola. Long Island, took charge
to score all four Ped goals in a 4-1
triumph over Geneseo. Goalie Gus
Tillman also stood out in goal in
that game when he lost a shutout
while on the bench. He had been
replaced in the final minutes of the
game after holding the Geneseo
bootci's scoreless.
