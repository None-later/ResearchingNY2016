STATE COLLEGE NEWb, FRIDAY. OCTOBER 17. 1958

 

ﬁne Mani @pbu’an

 

By DAVID FOTHERINGHAM

During the past few weeks, the
Political Conference has been pre-
paring a case for Myskania on the
legality of the recent, appointment
of a Senator to Senate. Before the
students could present their argu-
ments, Myskania published in the
State College News their opinion in
the case.

Rights To Appeal?

Whether this was meant to be
final or not. that is the impression
many students received. They
thought Myskania didn't want to
have cases brought before them, but
to judge cases without giving both
sides a chance. This is certainly
the way it appears.

Was The Case Important?

Last May Senate gave approval
to a rule of the Election Commis-
sion which gave the Senate the
power to appoint persons to fill va-
cancies in September until replace-
ment elections were held.

How can the Senate and the
President appoint a Senator to of—
fice? The Constitution says Sena-
tors shall be elected; no provision
allows for appointment. The elec-
tion of Senators is the most import-
ant control the students have on
their government. Such an appoint—
ment must therefore be allowed
only through the Constitution.

There is no provision in the Con—
stitution for By-Laws; amendment
is the only way to change the Con-
stitution. The action of the Senate
then is illegal, for how can a legis-
lative body alone change the basis
of its existence? There is no justifi-
cation by any stretch of the imagin-
ation.

Students Must Have Say

The rule in question cannot even
be considered as part of the inter-
nal rules of the Senate; it is clearly
a power of Student Association at

large. If the students wish to grant
the power to the Senate, they should
do it through amendment. If the
Senate can change the Constitution
without an amendment. why have
a Constitution?

Late Elections! Why?

If the Senate felt it could not
operate with a couple of vacancies.
why didn't it hold replacement elec-
titns right away? Is it because the
Election Commission rules say to
hold them in November? The Senate
could change this immediately. The
Election Commission and its rules
are it creation of the Senate.

But there is no reason why the
Senate could not wait until replace-
ment elections were held. Is it so
weakened by two vacancies? If these
vacancies did create such a strain
on Senate. why was only one filled,
and the other left vacant? At any
rate. the students should choose
the Senators, even for a month.
Appointment Illegal

Therefore, it is otir contention
that the appointment of Miss Mc-
Gowan to the Senate by the Presi-
dent, with the Senate's approval was
illegal. It cannot be justified b' any
of the powcrs granted in the Coti-
stitution to the President or the
Senate.

No Smear Intended

Let it be emphatically pointed out
that the Political Conference is not
questioning the qualifications of
Miss McGown. As far as we can see,
she is probably a very good choice.

The principle behind the appoint-
ment is very important, however. A
legislative body has no right to put
itself in the place of the voter in
choosing representatives. By doing
this, it endangers the rights of the
voter and gives the chosen person
an advantage in the election cam-
paigns.

Members Take

Part In Services

The Albany Chapter of the na-
tional Canterbury Club, a group
open to members of the Episcopal
Church or persons interested in it,
passed another milestone in its his-
tory last Sunday by taking over the
11 am. service at St. Andrew's Ep-
iscopal Church at Main and Madi-
son Avenues.

About 200 persons attended the
service, which saw nineteen of about
thirty members active ClthPl' as
readers. prayer leaders. :icolytcs, or
ushers. Serving as Officiant was Da-
vid Gillette of Bayport. L. 1.. who
also read the first les.~on; the psalms
wcre read by Betty Pf‘lcgl '59; thi-
second lesson was read by Sheila
Nichols ‘60 of Argylc: Prayers wcrc
led by Peter thiitoii '62. of Wood-
inere, L. 1.: two very cxccllcnt ser-
mons were given by the Vice Presi-
dent, aiy Hastinu's and the Presi-
dent. Bill Turnbull, SvlllOl'S.

more, Aime Igler. Ionc Simpkins.
Ha r r y Niitigcsscr, and Stewart
Brown were ushers.

National Group Founded Here

The nationwide group of students
who make up (‘unterbury (‘lub got
its start here in Albany when the
first meetings took place on Sunday
evenings just as they do now all
across the country.

It usually has a facility advisor,
and has an advisor from the church.
often the rector. 'l‘hc Albany group
is fortunate to have as faculty ad—
visor Dr. Moose. and as church ud-
visor. the Rev. Ralph Carmichael.

BY THE BYSTANDER

On the rear bumper of thc Volks-
wagen appeared the little sign,
“Don't hit me, I squash buts." We
might consrder the words on that
sign to be slightly symbolic. for the
bug that the Volkswagen and other
members of the foreign car family
may someday be squashing is the
American automobile.

Detroit Squirms

The mighty moguls of Detroit
have always been secure in their
secret plannin: rooms. While they

feverishly conceived then 1957
models, foreign manufacturers

slipped onto the Amcican auto mar-
ket with their simple, functional
automobiles. At first Detroit paid
no heed to the little motor bug from
across the ocean. After all, weren't
Americans eagerly shelling out four
and five thousand dollars for the
big-finned, gaudy - colored mon-
strosity known as the American
dream car?

Yes, they were. but into every

From This Vantage Point:

 

 

Commissioners Take 
Unpreadenfed Action  ‘ "’”

By JIM DOUGIIER’I‘Y

“You can’t tell the players without a scorecard!" This
old and weathered saying was altered at the most recent
AMIA football captains‘ meeting where the theme was
"you can‘t tell who’s on your team without a roster".

On Wednesday night I had the privilege of attending
the latest meeting of AMIA and was impressed with the
actions of Bob Dallow and Lou Call. It scms that these
men along with AMIA president Gus Tillman have taken
“unprecedented” initiative in handling a very unfortunate
circumstance.

The topic in question concerned i‘orf‘eitures and the
use of ineligible players in games. In particular the tricks
employed by the Goobers AC were used as an example.
How could any team or captain use two ineligible players
in a game, try to slip in a roster change ten days later,
and then plead ignorance to the fact that the players were
ineligible??? Well the Goobers did it, but they didn't get
away with it. Their actions were termed by Coach Ilath-
away as “clear and complete intent to defraud and that
such tricks have no place in any intramural program."
Six Team League Initiated

Needless to say the Goobers AC have been dropped
from the new six team league that starts Monday. The
Humps, who also had their problems over eligibility, were
also dropped from the old eight team league.

Dallow and Call. under the immediate direction of
AMIA President Gus Tillman have now planned what they
feel is a tight and uniform league which should improve
our entire intramural program.

It is the opinion of this writer that Bob Dallow, Lou
(fall, and Gus Tillman have done something that no other
AMIA ofﬁcials have had the intestinal fortitude to do.
They have upheld and enforced the rules of" AMIA in an
attempt to better our school intramural program.

on the subject are being expounded,
we will here attempt to present
the particulars about which the

At the beginning of thc sc ison. ill)
cight team league was sci up by
AMIA under the direction of Bob
Diillow and Lou Call, commissioners

Out of the first seven games
scheduled, all were forfeited because
of lack of the required iitimbcr of
men or the use of incligihlc players.

namely. the Humps :ind Goobers AC
were dropped from ihc lciiguc be-
cause of repeated failures to ilS-

then decided to dissohc thc cxisi-
big league and begin anew with the
six remaining teams. 'l‘hcrcf'orc the
previous record will bc discontinued

and a new lcziguc will bcgin on

The use of tlll‘t‘l‘ illcgiil players

by Goobers AC has also bccii un-

of AMI.-.. The remaining Humps
