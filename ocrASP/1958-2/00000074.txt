she competed in four ofﬁcial categori

such as Miss Southern Tier, and

Colleges and Universities may be represented in next year’s Pageant.

My Experience In
The Miss America Pageant

By MIRIAM

As the tales of summer experi-
ences draw to a close, I would like
to share a few of mine with the
readers of the State College News.
Ever since May 6, I have been in a
wide and varied whirl of activities
topped by the Miss America Page-
ant at Atlantic City—all a wonder-
ful part of being Miss New York
State for 1958.

The fruits of competition in any
Miss America Preliminary Contest
are well worth the effort. A total of
$2,500 in scholarships was given at
our State Pageant. I received $500:
four runners—up and four talent
winners received $250 each. This
fund may only be used for the pro-
motion of a girl's education, private
lessons as well as college expenses
are included. Every entrant in the
Miss America Pageant was the re-
cipient of a State Pepsi-Cola Schol-
arship from $500 to $1,500.
Breakfast With Judges

Breakfast with table hopping
judges is a unique and nerve wrack-
ing experience. Conversing with
them was not as difficult as one
might imagine. We grew to love
some of them such as Richard
Downing Pope who recently sent me
a copy of his new book “Water Ski-
ing." As owner and creator of Flor-
ida's Cypress Gardens, he extended
an invitation to me and my party
to be his guests at the Gardens for
water skiing if we should ever go
to Florida. Mitch Miller, a native
of Rochester, N. Y., invited us to
a recording session. Moss Hart told
us of the pains he was going through
while writing his autobiography not
yet finished.

Mr. and Mrs. Bennett Cerf were
as personable as they appear on
television. While Ann Gary Pannell,
President of Sweet Briar College,
charmed us with her gracious south-
ern ways. Mrs. Rosita H. Nordwell,
Chairman of the National Panhel-
lcnic Conference 1957-1959, was a
friendly motherly type. I was espec—
ially impressed by the quiet dignity
of Heidi Krall, one of the Metro—
politan Opera’s new personalities.
Those interested in the art world
would be fascinated by Edward
Marshall Boehm whose talents as

a sculpture‘ceramist has gained
him prestige throughout the world.
Girls Congenial

But most of all, I loved the girls.
It was a brief time that we spent
together, but one of the warmest ex—
periences in new friendships that I
have ever had. I remember late one
afternoon when Miss Rhode Island
and I were riding back to our hotels
from an exhausting rehearsal. My
one desire was a hot bath and a
chance to lie down. But this little
girl next to me insisted that we
sing all the way home! I was not
very surprised when on Saturday
morning, Ann Louise Willis, Miss
Rhode Island, was elected "Miss
Congeniality for 1959.”

During another rehearsal. I sent
Lee Thornberry from Alabama into
giggles of wonderment when I asked
her most. sincerely what a butter
bean was. Southern girls think we
are so strange sometimes. They
can‘t see that they talk any dif-
ferently than we do. whcn we ask
them to repeat a lot of their con—
\ersa tion.

The Pageant Week began with a
miles long boardwalk parade. Sonic
entrants had beautiful floats, others
were sponsored by local hotels or
special interest places. I was one
Of the contestants who rode on a
shiny new Oldsmobile convertible
The crowds lining the boardwalk.
which numbered 10,000 gave us a
fantastic reception by calling out
our first names and wishing us luck.
Cadet Escorts

Every state contestant was escort-
ed to the Coronation Ball in Trimble
Hall of the Claridge Hotel by a West
Point cadet from the same state. I
was personally relieved to be free of
the week-long tension and settled
back to relax with a good fast iindy.

The next morning I gathered to—
gether the numerous gifts which I
had received from the girls as a
token from their states. Among these
I packed ll live Palm tree from
Florida, sev‘cral silver spoons, a zinc
paperweight from Idaho, a sample
of uranium ore from Utah, and a
share in the Alaska Mineral and Oil
Stock. But the girl from New York
State was more grateful for the es»
pcricncc than anything clsc.
