STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY. OCTOBER 24, 1958

 

7Ae @uz‘u'cle Wade!

BY THE BYSTANDER

Recently the Louisiana State Uni-
versity's newspaper, Daily Reveille,
printed an editorial opposing the
closing of schools in Arkansas and
Virginia by the respective state gov-
ernments. The following day, the
Reveille drew this reader's com-
ment . . . a comment which we
found most interesting. and for that
reason, we pass it on to you.

Segregationist’s Stand

“Congratulations to students of
LSUNO. You are doing a fine job.
Just sit back calmly and let them
shove the Negroes down your
throats. It would be terrible to op-
pose it. After all, the opinion of nine
men is far more important than
the opinion of the majority of 170.-
000,000 people.

The previous paragraph is an ex-
aggerated example of the one-sided
view that the majority of our pa-
pers’ editors take when writing ed-
itorials. Since the beginning of sum-
mer semester, many articles favor-
ing integration have appeared in
our paper.

The purpose of this letter is to
present a little of the other side
for a change . . .

Some of us say that we wouldn't
mind if Negroes just attended our
classes. The damage from this alone
would be terrific. In Washington,
D. 0., white students are retarded
tremendously because of integrated
classes. In a national test given in
one school, white students averaged
98 while Negro students with the
same educational facilities averaged
only 51.

It doesn't stop with integrated
schools. If they get into our schools,
they will get into our social func-
tions. Don’t think they Won‘t, be-

cause they will. Maybe you don't
mind a Negro dancing with your
girl or asking her for a date, but I
do. Remember, if we give an inch,
they’ll take a mile . . .

When forced integration starts in
our school, home town and state,
we've got to fight it. It‘s our job, no
one else’s. If everyone puts up re~
sistance, regardless of how little,
the nine kings of our Supreme Court
would have no other alternative
than to give in."

Comment

We offer no comment. Is any

really necessary?

Cabinet Discusses Possibility
For Sunday Jazz, Art Shows

By ELAINE ROMAN’I‘OWSKI

Last Friday, amid the usual clat-
ter and chatter of the back cafe-
teria, sat a meager representation of
what was supposedly Student Asso-
ciation Cabinet. How's come only
two of the Ministers found the time
to be present? Surely not ALL of the
others were out, busily saving souls
via Practice Teaching?

Culture On Campus

The initial stages have been set
for introducing a series of jazz eon-
certs and art exhibits to encourage
a bit of cultural interest among the
students of State. These programs
are scheduled to be held in Bru—
bacher Hall on Sunday afternoons
beginning in January, and from the
looks of the tentative schedule, it
should be to the advantage of every
interested student to attend.

Primer On Ice

it seems as if plans for the Primer
are suspended in inid—air due to
heated feelings over the frozen bud-
get. If things are not brought down
to ii normal temperature soon,
wlii-re oh where will the literary ge-
niuses of State be able to display
their infamous talents? If necessary,
perchaiice the Penquin can be revi-
talized?
Exchange Papers Available

In the near future, Dave Feldman
will not be the only one who has
the opportunity to “pore” over the
exchange. Copies of the exchange
newspapers from other colleges will
soon be available in the library for
those students whose curiosities and

interests extend further than these
ivied walls.

’arking Lot Ready

Sometime next week, the tar-
driving Commuters of State will fin-
ally be blessed with a sorely-needed
parking lot. This lot, located on
Thurlow Terrace, will accommodate
approximately 300 cars and will be
available to Commuters ONLY.
Stickers will be issued to all car-
owners, and all violators of parking
regulations Will be tried and fined
by a traffic court. It was suggested
that in addition. marks may be
withheld until the violator's fine
is paid.

An invitation is extended to all
members of the Cabinet to attend
the next meeting, which will be
held in the Husted broom closet if
attendance is any poorer.

Smiles To Elect
New Secretary

A replacement election for the
secretary of Smiles and the co-or-
dinator of Neighborhood House will
be held Monday, announces Kath-
ryn O‘Connor '60, Vice-President of
Smiles.

Work Begun

Members of Smiles have begun
work at Albany Home and the
Neighborhood House. Halloween
preparations are now underway at
the Neighborhood House, and Smiles
members are making costumes for
children of the Albany Home.
