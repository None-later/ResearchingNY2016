74a @uz‘mle Mada!

BY THE BYSTANDER

Have you ever bothered to read
those little two or three line stories
which appear at the bottom of a
newspaper page. If you haven't, you
should do so at once. A wealth of
information is at your disposal
simply for the reading.

As we understand it, these items
are called “fill.” and their purpose
is to do nothing more than fill up
the page with type. Most newspapers
employ the "fill" idea. and to give
you an idea of the new; you may be
passing up by not including them in
your perusal of your favorite news-
paper, here are a few we happened
to note earlier this week. . . .

Inventor A Pioneer

Alexander Graham Bell, inventor
of the telephone, helped organize
Canada’s first airplane flight ln
Nova Scotia in 1909.

Population of Burma
The population of Burma, mim-
bering about 19,000,000 is 90 per cent
Buddhist in religion

Forum Lists

mental officials, legislators and as-
sistants; they will have the oppor-
tunity to observe Congress in action,

agencies and individual experts.
Members of the Seminar will share
ideas through open discussions with
these various groups.

Playboy Faces U.S. Mall Ban

closed here today that it was insti-
tuting proceedings to ban Playboy
Magazine from the mails on the

eleven sets of twins, the last being
born in 1947.

May They Rest In Peace

Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity
Jane were buried on Mount Moriah
overlooking Deadwood, SD.

Culture Pearls Grow Slowly

Oysters chosen to bear cultured
pearls require seven years to pro-
duce a gem.

Economy Drive Baokfires

Mayor Thiers of Cabourg won his
election by running on an economy
program. As a result of keeping his
promises, he has a broken arm. He
refused to approve funds to buy a
new carpet for the stairs at the city
hall. This week he tripped over the
old carpet and fell all the way to
the bottom.

Women Active In Turkey

A total of 314,520 Turkish women
is employed in the various profes-
sions and crafts of their country,
according to the Turkish Informa-
tion Office. More than 55,000 women
are employed in goverment service
as compared with 53,000 men.
Women voters outnumbered the men
in Turkey's 1957 parliamentary
elections.

Big News

As you can see, there’s quite a
storehouse of information to be ac-
quired from reading “fill” in the
newspapers. When you read it, re-
member, somewhere in the outside
world those few lines made page one
news!

Cabinet Discusses Proposal
For Building Up Dippikill

By ELAINE ROMATOWSKI

At the Cabinet meeting last Fri-
day a logical and reasonable sug-
gestion was put forth which, be-
lieve or not, could possibly put an
end to the seemingly unsolvable
question over the fate of our winte-
elephant camp. The main idea of
this simple, yet excellent solution.
is to take out a loan, sufficiently
large enough to enable the camp to
be developed at least half way.

With housing and a few other
facilities present at the camp, work
parties could be later sent up, and
the “Playground of Albany State"
could finally become of use to sonic-
one other than the Outing Club. The

for in addition to raising funds for

All In The Game:

Oswego Victims
Of State Spirit

By .I.\(‘K LICIVIS

 

a;

At last Friday night‘s pep rally, preceding the soccer
tilt with Oswego, Coach Joc Garcia commented to the
effect that regardless of the opposition's previous record,
the Feds would respond with cvci'y ounce of talent and
determination, if they could get student support.

On Saturday, despite the mother, the needed support
was evidently presan for Joe’s promise was carried out
to the letter as the squad trounch Oswego with their
faultless play. Considering Oswcgo's previous 6-1 record,
the Feds can be credited With no less than a deﬁnite upset
in a game in which mistakes were practically non-existent.

Greatest ’l‘cam Effort

Art Hackctt's ﬁrst goal seemed to propel the squad
and the fans to a fcvcrcd pitch and there was no stopping

from then on.

Hackctt had been moved from halfback to

wing position for the game which proved to be an advan-
tage as he and John Johnson, the other Wing, coordinated
perfectly to sink four goals bctwccn thcm. Carl Gertsen-
bcrgcr‘s passing again accounted lor scvcral set-ups which
resulted in goals. Lou DclSignorc, playing in his ﬁnal home
game, sailed the ball into thc not on a twenty yard kick.
This was one of thosc games when it can truly bc
-said that no onc playcr was rcsponsiblc for the win. Coach
Garcia dcscrlbcd it pcrfcclly whcn he described it as, “one
of thc grcatcst tcam cil'oi'ts since I began coaching at

State."

Ilackctt Paces Pods

The scoring in the 6-1 victory
was paced by a Junior, Art Hackett,
of Cairo, who hit the range for three
goals in a sudden scoring spurt for
the first scores of his varsity career.
The rest of the front line got in on
the party with goals by John John-
son and Frank Fallacc, and a pic-
ture goal by Lou Dclsignorc round—
ing out the one sided battle. Most
observers felt that Delsignore scored
the best goal of the day, lifting a
high hard shot over the heads of
two dcfcnscmcn for a perfect boot
into the upper corner of the nets.

Carl Gertsenbcrgcr, who failed to
hit the scoring rungc, collected two
assists for the day's '..‘()l‘i’., as well as
credit for scvcral torrid shots on
goal.

Iiiickficld Shines

Credit for the i"iuinph bclongs as
much to a backfield l‘ilCCfl by Marty
Borko and Ed Koubck as to the for-
yard linc. Borko, an Ellcnvillc prod-
uct now a Sophomore, played one of
his best games and must be given
the nod for the best game of the
day along with Ed Koubck who
turned in a great gamc in a great
halfback performance.

Thc bright beam remains on the
soggy .A‘IIA football field this week,
to spotli 'it Jerry Pickard and Jim
Flore.

Pickard, APA's quarterback, threw
two tremendous yard gaining passes
to lend the APA boys to a decisive
l2-0 victory over Union Heights.

 

Piorc, who suffered a broken jaw
last week, is back with the APA
team this week, coaching them to
their season‘s first victory.

The loss was the second for Os-
wego this season, and caught the
Lakers reeling after a defeat at the
hands of powerful Brockport State
two days before. It was a real team
effort, however, and one of which
Joe Garcia and his bail club may be
justifiably proud.

Meet Bridgeport Tomorrow

Tomorrow the Feds meet Bridge-
port on the Knight’s home grounds
in what looms as a tough battle.
The Bridgeporters have won six of
seven starts and boast a goalie who
has given up only four goals in the
seven games for a 0.56 average. On
Wednesday of this week Bridgeport
defeated Clark by a 9-0 score and
had previously beaten Lowell Tech
by a 5-0 margin.

Last season the teams met In AI-
bany where the Knights took six
sports on the Feds goal and scored
twice while turning back an Albany
attack that would make MacArthur
blanch with only one goal; two
years ago the Peds won by a 5-2
score on the same field that they
will play tomorrow.

The season will draw to a close
with two games late in the
week, one against Union and the
other against the old Ped jinx,
Panzer. The traditional season end-
ing game against the New Jersey
squad, won only once by the Feds,
may see the tables turned as the
team having suddenly found itself
and played the type of game of
which it is capable, could surprise
the Panzer booters with the cry of
“remember Oswego!" and a few
goals in the nets.

Bench bits: Old timers back for
the game included Paul Dammer,
Wendell Fowler, Warren Dunham,
Sig Smith . . . the JV's dropped a
4-1 decision to Union but out-
hiistled the Garnet all the way . . .
Ron Coslick played a great game for
the junior booters . . . Dave Colburn
got the Fed goal . . . look for im—
provement in the Feds on the road
. the cheerleaders will be on
hand at Bridgeport tomorrow . . .
