Senate:

Senate Appropriates Money

From Surplus

By JOAN CALI

Student Senate meeting was called
to order at 7:30 pm. Wednesday
eveningr by the President, John
Yager.

Bill To Appropriate

First on the agenda was the read-
ing of a bill to appropriate two hun-
dred dollars out of surplus to the
Student Directory. This was referred
to the Finance Committee for fur-
ther consideration and discussion.
The price is right . . . maybe . . .
Addition To Senate Rules

Next. the third reading of a bill
to add a constitutional committee
as a standing committee of Senate
was passed. This is one committee
that has been functioning in every
phase of college. however. Just need-
ed a title to make it a legal group.
Student Union Board Constitution

An addition to Student Union
Board's constitution was brought up.
t stated that for certain offenses in
the Lower Lounge of Brubacher
Hall. such as leaving coats and food
around. warnings would be issued
and student tax privileges limited.

Fortunately. this was defeated. It
was revealed that since Student
Union Board does not issue warnings
for some actions which belong in
the category of "beware," why do
this for leaving coats around?! Be-
sides. it gets warm in there.
DiScussion, Discussion . . .

Senate then discussed many facets
of business which also disturbed
Student Council many years ago.
Perhaps such areas as publicity and

Monday, October 27. marked the
opening of the second “Art Show"
on the campus for the present school
year. Attendance at this glorious
opening was off quite a bit. This
could have been attributed to the
foul weather. or possibly, because
those posters reading “Cakes and
Ale" didn't possess the proper sub-
liminal twist that's necessary to
motivate the masses in attendance
here at ‘Statc.’

Nine Oils. Eight Watercolors

Mr. Cowley. the Chairman of the
Art Department, had the good for-
tune to secure nine oils and eight
watercolors of Richard Crist. a na—
tionally known abstract painter. Mr.
Crist is currently employed as a
draftsman with IBM. Kingston, New
York.

Abstractions

When you visit the gallery, one of
the first questions that comes to
mind is the reason for the great
dissimilarity between his earlier
Watercolors of plant life and his
Canvasscs. If the viewer will keep
in mind the tact that these are ob-
stractions. or paintings that have no
rccognixublc objects in them. and
have no .issiiclutloii Willi nature. he
will then no able to appreciate and
understand the artist's attempts
more fully.

For example, it you wcrc to study
the painting just to your left as
you enter the door. you Would fliid
