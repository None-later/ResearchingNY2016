STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. NOVEMBER 7. 1958

 

Professors, Digressors ? ? ?

Professors are forever grading their students. Some
have permitted students to do some rating on their pro-
fessors. Commenting on these studies, in his new critical
book on higher education, Some of My Best Friends are
Professors, Professor George Williams of the Rice Institute
in Texas ﬁnds that in a typical study:

53 ’/n of their professors were rated “poor”.
37% were fair.
10% were considered excellent by the students.

“These ﬁgures,“ Williams adds, “reflects pretty well my
own experiences with colleagues who have children in col-
lege, often in the same college where their fathers taught.
These children have had the advantage of professional,
and often intimately informed, advice in the choice of
professors and courses. Nevertheless, almost every one of
these professor-fathers whom I have consulted has admit-
ted that at least half of the professors under whom his
children studied were incompetent.“

But lest the opinion 01' students seem insufficient as a
criterion of success in a university, Professor Williams
sadly reveals another criterion: the number of students
who ﬂunk out of the universities. The number is usually
held to be classiﬁed information by universities, but some
estimate can be obtained by knowing that most any
graduating class is usually about 60 to 65 percent as large
as it was when it entered as a freshmen class. We must
assume that 35 to 409 of the students who enter college
do not graduate.

Dr. Williams warns that it would be a mistake to
assume that all students who do not graduate necessarily
represent personal failures. “We would not be far wrong
in estimating that the colleges are absolute and total
failures in trying to edu ‘ate about 20 to 30'. of the stu-
dents they originally selected as hopeful prospects."

Naturally in spite of the students‘ opinion of their
professors, the universities prefer to say that it is the stu—
dents who have failed and not the student's university.
But is this true? Dr. Professor Williams doubts it, and he
documents his belief that the failure must be laid at the
door of some of his best fricnds, the university professors.

It is also worth mentioning that he points out that
200,000 of the students in the upper fouith of their high
school graduating class who enter college drop otit of their
own volition because they feel that college has nothing to
offer them. This 200,000 constitutes a student material
as good as any college can expect; yet the college failed to
give them a “higher education.”

Professor Williams attempts to locate this source of
failure but not before concluding with this warning:
“About 93'. of American institutions of higher learning
are doing a poor job producing scholars that satisfy col-
legiate standard of scholarsf'iips.”

We wonder how State would late if" iludcrgradiuitc
opinions concerning thcsc topics wcrc uncovcrcd. And lcs;
we forget our illustrious student body, wc. as future teach-
ers in high schools and collcgis, ('(il‘l(l do a little soul—
searching on fhc matter.

Chairman, Parents' Day.
Editor-in-Chief:

As everyone knows. the class of"
1962 has won rivalry. Naturally, ev-
eryone in the frosh class contributes
to our winning. even if they merely
went out to cheer for the sports
events. However. the deciding factor
was the. frosh-Soph skits, for which
credit was given to the entire cast
and the director.

However, a name on the program
was not enough for several people
who worked on the skit who also
deserve diic credit.

M a r y b e 11 Blachbum, Pianist;
Frances Ci('ci'o. Assistant Director:

Rolcne Macrini. Hinge Manager;
Eugene I.ilel)ow117,_ Lighting: and

Linda Levinson. Choreongphcr.
should all be acknowledged for their
tremendous work.

Especially. the freshman class
would like to express its apprcz-ia-
tion to Sylvia Steinof'f and Charles
Weed' Juniors, co-guartJans for the
class.

Again. I would like to thank these
people on bchiilf of tne class. As
the saying goes. "Give Crcdil Wherc
Credit Is Due."

Sincerely,

Editor: State College News:

Recently while strolling down the
corridors and going about my busi-
ness. I chanced to see a "hight to
behold"; young love in flill bl..om
being expressed, of course, in ilic
most ostentatious manner physical
display of affection. I have sccn this
before in my travels of tile hallowcd
halls of State, but on this occasion.
I was most einl.)arrasscd. Why? Not.
because I had witnessed this exhibi—
tion of admiration. but. ll('('21ll.\(‘ a
faculty member happened to bc
passing. At first, shc continued on
iier way, being polite and obviously
hesitant about. saying anything.
Then she proccct‘lcd to adriionish,
quite apologetically, llil‘lf‘ actions.
The sheer that followed her poliic
gesture was disgusting.

Really now. this may sound like
an overworked and true statement,
but are we or are we iiol adults?
Grow tip. you who are overcome by
the elixir of love and makc room
to walk up the stairs and through
the corridors. Affcr all. cigai'cl.l.c

pancy.

Frosh Win
Rivalry Cup;
Defeat Sophs

State College has a new queen
and the freshmen have a new rivalry
cup! Campus Night was an evening
of victory for Rosemarie Sepe, new
Campus Queen and the class of
1962.

Crowned by Miss Sally Harter,
former queen who was escorted by
Lynn Becraft and Carol Waldron,
Miss Sepe was accompanied by Ma-
rion Sciortino and Miriam Sander-
son. Seniors. Other members of the
court were Barbara Hubbard, Ann
Fleming. Juniors; Marilyn Alston,
Doris Wagner, Sophomores; Patri-
cia Jones. and Patricia Kadick,
freshmen.

The rivalry cup may not be new
but it is new to the freshmen. Their
victory was the first since 1948 when
the class of 1952 defeated the Soph-
cmoi'e class of 1951. Prior to that
the class of 1944 emerged victorious
over the class of 1943.

During this ten—year span many
changes have taken place in the
traditional rivalry events. The main
change being the length of time de-
ioted to these activities. At one
time Rivalry lasted from the begin-
ning of the fall semester until Mov—
ing-Up Day in May. During this
period there were numerous activi-
ties which included swimming meets.
ping pong tournaments. hockey
games and other sports events.

"Dorothy." the freshman skit, was
directed by Robert Steinhower. The
Sophomores presented “New Boy In
Town" which was directed by Mari-
cllcn Weinberg.
