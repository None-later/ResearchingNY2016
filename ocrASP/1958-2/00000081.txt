A new idea in smoking...

 

Paaélema
plied/em

Documentary evidence has
played that it is what's up top
that counts. When one considers
the intangibles involved in this
intrinsically ludicrous problem,
one can see that here indeed is
11'] enigma. “What.” you may
say. "what is the problem?"
Ah, yes, Len-in lies a tale, and
an intriguing one it is too. But
no need to get dirty now. after
all there has been enough mud-
sling‘ing these past few weeks.
So much for politics, on to our
problem.

This problem is, of course, of
paramount interest [what ever
did happen to movies, are they
gone the way of the tailless car
and the five cent cigar?) when
all is. in the last measure, con-
sidered.

When one is aware of all the
\iewpoints. 1 am sure that one
will then realize that all the
world, though staged. is not
composed of mere players, but
(and this is of overwhelming
significance) rather of people—
after all everyone is people.

sociation Christmas Sing will be

From This Vantage Point:

  

Looks Like Someone
Thought Up A Reason . 

By JIM ool'oiiEk'rv

The following letter was received at a very appropriate
time; a time when it looks as though Coach Joe Garcia
and his varsity grapplers will face a rugged ten meet
schedule with as little manpower as is humanly possible.
Maybe it‘s just the usual apathy!

To The Sports Editor:

Recently I have had to retire from participating in
an athletic sport after having completed most of the
training. Those hectic two days of calisthentics took it
out of me. Since then I have been confronted with snide
remarks from other sportmanites. I quit because:

I. I'm a physical wreck.

2. I have little will power.

3. I can't give up smoking.

4. I can‘t give up drinking.

5. How could I have coffee in the Union at 4 o‘clock
if I have practice.

6. After all, bridge games are rough on one's physical
make up.

7. i only have a 3.9 index and have to study 30 hours
a week and 6 hours of practice would certainly lower my
average to at least 3.8.

8. Some of these formats fall the night before a couple
of the events.

S). I‘m now a big “frat man.“

10. Somebody else is better than me.

Now I hope that you fellas are satisfied. I‘m so nervous
since then and am mad at you all for being meanies. I’m
no quittcr. Tired

, Season Finale Pii Peds,
Mon’rclairln Road Baffle

By DAVE MILLER

The 1958 soccer season will come to a close tomorrow
and with it the careers of four seniors as the Peds make
the trip to Monclair, New Jersey to face the transplanted
Panzer squad in a 2 pm. ﬁnale that pits them against a
team they have beaten only once.

For the four, this will be the climax of hard work and
sweat that go into a great game.
Tillman, Hank Boehning, Lou DelSignore, and Ed Koubck
——Can go onto the ﬁeld tomorrow knowing that they have
given their best; that they have worked hard to justly
earn the merits they deserve.

But they will not do this. They will go onto the field
x ' .1 O, tomorrow with the feeling that they are doing their best
 ' ' ' not for their sake but rather for the team effort that pro-
. V .  duces wins—and that if the best is not good enough, they
  I will produce a little bit more.

An unsung hero of the Pcd bootcrs
