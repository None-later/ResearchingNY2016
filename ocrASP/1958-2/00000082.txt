STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. NOVEMBER 7.

 

‘7!” 044%. Model

BY THE BYSTANDER

“But, I am much bigger than you,"
cried the elephant, as his massive
shadow fell over the frame of the
tiny donkey. The donkey, with a
confident gleam in his eye, quickly
retaliated: “I don't care how big you
are, the people have spoken. You
have been exiled. Get out of my
land!" Tears welled up in the ele-
phant's eyes; slowly he turned
around, and headed up the trail for
New York State. As the pachyderm
lumbered along, he was heard to
mutter, “Just wait, I’ll come back.
I’ll get even. Just wait."

GOP (Grand Ousted Party)

And thus it was in the elections
held throughout the nation earlier
this week. From Atlantic to Paciﬁc,
the stubborn Democrat donkey rear-
ed up his hind legs and booted the
bigger, heavier elephant out of office.
To put it mildly. 1958 as an election
year will go down in history as an
overwhelming victory for the Demo-
crat Party.

The Democrats this past Tuesday
routed the GOP from the United
States Senate, the House of Repre-
sentatives, and in many states, grab-
bed ofT governorships and legislative
bodies that previously had been-
“safe” Republican outposts.

Some say the Democrat victory
may be attributed to the disappoint-
ment of the electorate in President
Eisenhower. Ike is still admired as
a gentleman and a personality, but
many in the land now seriously
doubt his capabilities as an adminis-
trator. Others attribute the smash-
uig .defeat of the Republicans to
foreign policy and the actions of
John Foster Dulles, unemployment,
and business recession.

There were no issues in- the cam-
paign, other than the controversial
Right to Work amendments pro-
posed in some states. Generally,
outSide of local issues, both parties
did an outstanding job of erasing
issues out of existence. Such touchy
subjects as the segregation problem
in the South were left completely

out of the election picture.
Elephant Convalescent Home

Only in New York State could the
Republicans ﬁnd some comfort in
their moment of agony. In the
battle between millionaires, Nelson
A. Rockefeller swamped Governor
Harriman by some half-million votes
in one of the nation's hottest gub-
ernatorial elections. The GOP also
retained, in its usual manner, both
houses of the State Legislature, and
sent Kenneth Keating of Rochester
to the United States Senate to re—
place Irving M. Ives. In short, as
New York State went, so the rest of
the nation didn’t!

60's Triple Threat

Even before all the tabulations
were in this past Tuesday night,
politicos and news commentators
were discussing the presidential
election of 1960. Vice-President
Nixon, who prior to Tuesday's elec-
tion appeared to be the front-run-
ner for the GOP nomination- in '60,
will now have to contend with Nel-
son Rockefeller for the nomination.
The Question of Kennedy

The Democrat victory also poses
a problem for that party in 1960.
Who will the nominee for the presi-
dency be? Youthful Senator John
Kennedy rolled up a fantastic vote
in his Massachusetts campaign for
re-election to the Senate.

Much has been said and written
of this popular Democrat, primarily
because he is a Roman Catholic
who is very much in the running
for the Democrat presidential nom-
ination. His chances for success at
the next Party convention have been
enhanced by the defeat of Governor
Harriman, which practically elim-
inates him from any important posi-
tion- on the national political scene
in the future.

The men to watch are Nixon,
Rockefeller, and Kennedy, for as it
now stands, any one of the three
could very likely be President come
1960.

l Ped Political

Purposes, Status

A new group of students concern-
ed with politics on the campus has
recently been formed.

Originally known as the Political
Conference, the official name of the
group is now Ped Political Party.
It consists of some students who
are currently in politics as well as
those who are not, and meets in
Brubacher Hall every Thursday
night at 7:30 pm.

These meetings are open to any-
one interested in- the groups activi~
ties, and anyone can become a mem-
ber.

Future Plans

The plans of Ped Political Party
for the future include having a
Nominating Convention to set up
a slate of candidates for the Stu-
dent Association elections in Febru-
ary. The party wil .llSO endorse
candidates from each of the three
classes which will be electing.
Purposes

The Fed Political Party lists sev-
eral purposes including:

i. To act as a check on the gov-
erning body by advocating new
policies and raising new issues.

2. To act as a point of coalescence
around which student interest can
be safeguarded from the pressures
created by private groups in their
effort to inﬂuence student govern—
ment.

The Constitution of the Fed Poli-
tical Party is now in the process
of being recognized by the Student
Senate.

Ofﬁcers will consist of chairman,
vice—chairman, secretary, and treas-
urer.

Group Status

Until now the group has been
functioning unofﬁcially as Political
Conference, and it was under that
name that it brought the case be-
fore Myskania considering the con-
stitutionality of the election bill.

CabinetDiscussesHandbook,
Party Disc/oses Editor's Recommendations

By ELAINE RONATOWSKI

An excellent recommendation con-
cerning Frosh Handbok publication
was read at the Cabinet meeting
last Friday. Its most important
point states that the Handbook staff
should be composed of both Soph-
omores and Juniors and that the
editor should be a Junior.

Therefore the Sophomores of one
year would have sufﬁcient enough
experience to run the publication
of the next year’s Handbook with-
ort much difficulty.

Posters Disappear

Campus Commission seems to be
over—anxious in the performance of
its duties lately. Posters are being
removed from the walls of the peri-
styles even before the activities
which they are advertising are fully
organized. We hope it is merely a
co-incidence that the majority of

Culture

D&A Council, in addition to bring-
ing “art” back into its activities, has
been considering doing several ex-
perimental three-act plays called
“Eleven-Day Wonders.” These plays
are worked on intensely for eleven
days and are then presented in
whatever stages of readineSS they
may be.

Music Council is in the process of
planning a series of “poetry and
jazz" for Sunday Listening Hours,
and has also been thinking about
staging a “State College Musicale."

Mysterious Declinations

Intrigue crept into our usually un-
interested campus when nominees
for Senate replacement elections
were declined without their knowl-
edge. Was it these same jokers who
crossed the names off the Senate
nominations that also used the
Campus Queen nominations to fur-
ther their sadistic tendencies?

Perhaps a locked box or a glass-
enclosed case would remedy the
problem of the mysterious declina-
tions, but What can be done about
the uncontrollable list of farcical
nominations?

ACP Delegates
Leave Thursday

Next Thursday four members of
the State College News staff and
three from the Pedagogue will leave

newspaper and yearbook staffs of
college level publications.

Delegates

The delegates, who will leave at
12:30 p.m.. include from the News
Mary Fitzpatrick ’59 and Jane Gra~
ham, Martha Lesick and Elizabeth
Spencer, Juniors.

Representing the Pedagog‘ue will
be Delores Russell and R. J. Ban-
ficld, Seniors, and Teresa Kerwin '60.

Weekend Conference

The Conference will encompass
the weekend and will terminate
Sunday. It will include sessions on
all phases of production and concern
itself with the problems of publica-
tion staffs.
