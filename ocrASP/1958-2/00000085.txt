Tackles

All In The Game:
Spirit Paramount
In AMIA League

By JACK LEWIS

After the deciding game between Potter Club and SLS
last Saturday, the following telegram was received at the
Potter house.

POTTER CLUB

415 STATE ST, ALBANY, N. Y.
CONGRATULATIONS ON A WELL PLAYED GAME AND
A WELL DESERVED WIN, SINCERELY—

THE BROTHERS OF SIGMA LAMBDA SIGMA

Occurrences such as this are what keep the intramural
spirit alive at State. After an exhibition such as this we
must readily admit that the purpose and effect of the
AMIA leagues is still the promotion of sportsmanship and
the tying together of the various groups on campus.
Highlights of the ’l‘ilt

As for the game itself, the statistics tell the story. The
Potter defense held tight throughout the course of the
game, giving the SLS nine little opportunity to approach
the goal. The scoring came as a rcsult of thrcc passes by
quarterback Don Nolan which l'cll into the hands of Owcn
Davis, Wendell Fowler and Lou Call. It cannot be dcnicd
that the Club had its share of breaks but it is also trtic
that thc SLS squad was dcfinitcly outplaycd and that thc
outcome came as no surprise, llowcvcr wc must again say
that the highlight of thc aftcrnoon was thc spirit and
sportsmanship cxhibitcd oi Vithcr sidc.

In the abscncc of a Sport Spotlight this Week wc
would like to mcntion thc Potter line which kcpt thc SLS
offense off balance, and quarterback, Don Nolan for his
cool thinking and accurate passing. Also, iii thc thick of
the action Wcrc SLS quarterback Ed Vcsncskc and 1c-
ceivers, Bud Baker and Paul Harris who actcd as a thrcat
to the Club with their successful pass plays.

Basketball In Motion

Thc AMIA basketball league is now under way to take

ovcr thc intramural scene. 'l‘hrcc lcagucs have been or—

 

ganized with their respective commissioners being Bud
Baker, Lee Upcraft and Pete Barbcgclata. 'I‘hc grapcvme
has it that the newcomers, the Old Men are about to walk
away With the laurels.

Intramural
Bowling Now
Underway

Once again. as the time for the

i“ AMIA Bowling League to resume its

activities draws near, interest and
excitement begins to mount. Predic-
tions and dire warnings, taunts and
beast»: are already being passed be-
lw .‘Cll teams.

To add to the general commotion.

EEP Downs SLS; Takes 11th
Consecutive AMIA Title

By MIKE COYLE

This week‘s AMIA results bring
the 1958 football slate to it close.
Again this season Potter Club
copped the cup. The men from State
street demonstrated an undefeated
season, featuring 4 wins and 1 tie,
'iipturin: 9 of the 10 points possible
in the regular season. The game
that decided the final outcome was
1:'ayed Saturday between Potter and
SLS. Behind the fine offensive at-
tic); that contributes to their sea—
son‘s record. the Club rolled over
their South Lake opponents 18—0.
i’cttcr Boasts Strong Line

The deciding factors in this yic-
tory were the strong Potter line.
a variety of plays engineered by
quarterback Don Nolan, and alert
dc.cnsivc backs. Against the almost
pirfect functioning of this combina-
tion it is no wonder that SLS was
swa inped.

  

{2‘5- «-

Don Nolan of Potter successfully tags Bud Baker of SLS. Action

took place last Saturday at the AMIA championship game. Potter

swamped SLS 18—0.

The other game that added to the
final outcome was Thursday, be-
tween SLS and KB. SLS came out
victorious 6-0. This game was the
one eliminating KB and setting
SLS up for the championship game.
KB Displays Spectacular Team

In another KB game on Tuesday.
APA was defeated 7-6. This year KB
surprised everyone by fielding one of
the strongest athletic teams in their
history. Evidence of this fact is that
the men from Washington Ayenue
finished only two points behind the
league lenders, and ahead of such
strong competitors as APA.

The touchdown which won the
game for KB was ti freak. On
a confusing punt attempt it KB de-
fender grabbed the ball just off the
toe of the punter and scampcrcd
into the end zone.

Sayles Wins By Forfeit

The other game this week be-
tween Sayles and Unioti Heights dc-
cided who would be in the cellar.
Although the game ended in ll'l
0-0 tie, it was considered a win for
Sayles by forfeit. The reason for
this forfeit was that Union Heights.
because of injuries, was forced to
use a player who wasn't in the
roster.

Bob Dallow. AMIA commissioner,
has announced the All-Star team
that will face Potter, the champs.
Each of the other teams in the
league is represented except Sayles.
All-Star Team ls Picked

The following list is not the team
that was actually selected but, be-
:tiuse eight men from Potter Club
had to be replaced, it is the team
that will play in the All-Star game.
Of this team, featuring 18 players.
8 are from SLS, the second place
club, six from KB the third place
club, three from APA, and one from
Union Heights.

We would like to tip our hats to
the league commiSsioncrs this year.
after starting with difficulty be-
cause of the insincerity of some of
the teams originally entered.

From This Vantage Point:

Fall Wrap-Up

Winter Preview  
Br JIM DOUGIIERTY ‘ - ‘-

December is fast approaching and with it State‘s
athletes will move indoors. The walk to Bleecker will be
replaced with running the stairs in Page and hands will
again become as important as feet. For some unknown
reason this is the time when State students realize that
we have varsity teams and school spirit begins to show
itself. During the winter the number of fans out-numbers
the players for a change.

Soccer: The Garciamen evened their season record
with a 5 to 3 overtime win against Montclair. This was
their ﬁrst triumph over the Indians in ﬁve years. . . . Frank
Fallacc set a school scoring record by tallying 14 goals in
10 games. . . . Tomorrow night at the Soccer Dance next
year's co-captains and this season‘s MVP will be announced.
. . . Merle Miller will be back in action for the 1959 catn-
paign. . . . Deserving credit goes to Gus Tillman. Lou Del-
Signore, Eddie Koubeek and Hank Boclining who have
earned ﬁne records while playing here at State. . . . A cer-
tain sportswriter “ﬁnally saw a game.“ Are you all satisﬁed
now?????

Wrestling; Fourteen men are presently on the roster
of the 58-59 edition of the varsity grapplers. . Connie
’I‘ischer is back after four years with Uncle Sam. He
wrestled here in ‘53 when the sport was still on a club
basis. Dave Pause and Mike Kessler along With co-
captains Charlie Kane and Joe Hill are the only returning
lettermen. . . . The Garciamen open their season at home
against Brooklyn Poly on December 6th.

Basketball: Coach Dick Saiicrs will be counting heavily
on 6‘ 3" Tom Ryan this season. . . . Don Cohen is expected
to take over the rebounding job held by Don Mayer last
year. . . . Jack Beardon and Tom Baiighn should pick up
the slack in scoring left by Mayer, Dick Causey and Don
Beardon.

Three Overtime Goals
Triumph Over Montclair

Recesso Tallies Equalizer To
Set Stage For Winning Boot

By DAVE MILLER

An overtime thriller sparked by Frank Fallace’s three
goals, Chuck Recesso’s tying goal in overtime, and a shot
by co-captain Lou DelSignore provided the seasonal ﬁnale
for the Peds in Montclair, New Jersey last Saturday as the
Garciamen ﬁnally cracked the jinx of the former Panzer
athletes to register a 5-3 overtime victory by coming from
behind twice, once in overtime.

The triumph came on the heels of a 4-2 conquest of
Union and marked the ﬁfth time this season that the
Golden booters have outscored their opponents. It evened
at ﬁve wins and ﬁve losses, with three of the losses coming
at Bleecker Stadium where the weather (it was raining
in three of the ﬁve appearances) failed to dampen the
spirit of the enthusiastic crowd.

"""V’S" “"5 5””? 11 high of fourteen goals for the

thc c'piilizcr to set the stage for victory was the second over
Fran; Fiilliicc's winning boot at the Union for the Peds in three
t'. ht minute mark of the ten minute years.

: 'crl mi. Fallace Sets Record

Apparently to show that his win- Frank Fallace, a sophomore for-
ning goal was no fluke. the record- ward frotn Carle Place, Long Island,
l’lt‘Jliill' right winger parked an- set an early scoring pace that was
c‘hrr  111 only scrrn seconds left never challenged to establish a rec-
to put the game out of reach and hit ord that may stand for several
years unless he breaks it next year
himself. Scoring in bunches of three,
he hit for a trio four times and
scored once in each of two other
games for a 14 goal total, five more
than he needed for a record.
Retain Nucleus

The nucleus of the squad for next
season. including such as Lou Empie,
Karl Gerstenberger, and Franz
Zwickclbiiuer. remains as only four
seniors depart. Marty Borko, great
as ii back this season, will be on
hand along,r with Fallace and Gres—
tcnberger; Ed Walsh, {1 Florida,
New York resident, and Art Hackett
will be patrolling the backfield.

The bootcrs may look to Dave Col-
biirn, up from the JV's, to fill a
starting spot after the winger gave
a good show in the last two games
of the season,
