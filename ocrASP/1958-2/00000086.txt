74a guild’s Week!

BY THE BYSTANDER

Will a lunar rocket soon reach
its destination? Will man soon set
foot on the moon? Is there a. blue-
print somewhere being drawn up for
the first settlement up there in the
clouds? As far as we are concerned,
these are relatively unimportant
questions for this day and age. We
have no desire to know if two-headed
green people are peering down at us
from up above. or if the largest sup-
ply of green cheese in existence is up
there Just waiting for some enter-
prising capitalist to package.

Sail Along Silvery Moon

As one professor stated it.
everytime man runs into problems,
he heads for the frontier. He is do-
ing it now, in the twentieth cen-
tury, only this time the frontier is
straight up rather than west. Let’s
leave the moon for the lovers :0
gaze at wistfully. instead of plan—
ning its exploration.

Now, don’t misunderstand us, we
are grateful to science and tech-
nology for what they have done in
the past and present for humanity.
We don't even mind the persistent
arguments of educators that the
Sputnik had little to do with the
present science emphasis in our
high schools. Science we bow to
thee!

Our Beef

But why make a wild dash for
the moon? In the end, it will only
create more world problems to be
solved at the United Nations or at
3. Geneva conference. Let's clean the
downstairs before running upstairs.
What most Americans are inter-
ested in right now is whether they
are breeding cancer in their lung‘s
by smoking; whether radioactive
fallout is someday going to pollute
the air we breathe. and if future
generations shall run out of food.

Yankee, Stay Home

When and if we get there, what
do we do with it? Shall we use it
as an unspoiled battlefield to set-
tle some of the problems yet to be
settled on earth? This might be
one answer. It’s not too pleasant
an answer. but it is possible.

Let's call the whole experience
off for the time being. Let's wait
until the UN docket is cleared of
earthy problems; let’s lift the iron
curtain; then, shoot the moon.

COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. NOVEMBER 14. 1958

CabinetReviews GentlemanAuctionsChinese;
Motors To Paris For Rest

Parents' Day,
Conference, B all

At the Cabinet meeting last Fri-
day, it was recommended that for
Parents’ Day a polished State Col-
lege Theatre production be given
rather than take another chance
on Campus Night skits. Another
factor that was mentioned is that
a production such as “A View From
The Bridge” would give a more re-
alistic view of college talent.
Leadership Conference

One of the proposals currently be-
ing discussed is a leadership confer-
ence to immediately follow the Feb-
ruary elections. The proposed make-
up of the conference would be all
new senators and Student Associa-
tion officers, the presidents and
treasurers of all organizations on
campus. the house presidents. Resi-
dence Council, and the old and new
Cabinet Ministers.
inauguration Ball

Also under consideration is the
possibility of holding an Inaugura—
tion Ball the Saturday night that
election results are announced. How-
ever. the plan has it good many
problems to be solved before it can
be put into action, despite popular
approval.

The most obvious drawback ons—
pecially for the Junior clussr is the
fact the Junior Prom is scheduled
just two weeks after Inauguration
Day. One of the two forinals will
have to suffer, and we fear it will
be the Junior Prcrn if the idea that
Student Association funds pay for
the band and essentials is accepted.

In addition, there would have :.i
be a rescheduling of the Social Cal—
endar since the class banquets are
presently planned for that night.

By DAVID

Why I remember in my youth, son.
we used to auction off hundreds of
Chinese at a time, right there on
Little Quemoy. By Godfrey. we sold
them and made quite a profit. Of
course every now and then we ran
into a little trouble from the Foreign
Office, but with a few quid here and
there. why we had them eating out
(.f our hands."

“Yes. old man, yes." I mumbled
over my brew, “and tell me about
the Man Maus."

“Yes those Mali Maus were rough.
old chap. but not so bad as those
auctioned-off Chinese.

"Why, I remember there in the
market place one day. It was about
ten time and only those mad dogs
and Englishmen were out in that
post-midday sun. I might add. pur-
cnthctically. old boy. that the natives
were never out at all. midday sun or
what. They were lazy bounders, those
chaps wcrc.

“There we. were eating in the teen)-
ing market place when what to our
wondering eyes did appear, but the
Thanksgiving Holiday. ‘Ho matey,‘ I
it‘llCCl, ‘tea is out.’

“With that down (-uinc Mao and
thirteen bugle-looting troops yelling
“One from the left and tWo from
the right column, sir.’ The rest of the
whole blinking army was behind
them. I call them blinking although
they wore goggles just so that they
would not have to blink. I tell you.
son, the drought was bad that year
and the sand dimes worse. Wcll . . .‘

"Have another beer. pops, and tell
us about the blasted Singalese.“

“Well, harrumph, to continue.

FELDMAN

There were, this Leftenant and my-
self. Now what do you suppose we
did?"

“Turned around and ran? Have
another beer. Hey barkeep—just act
nonchalant. pop."

“No, young fellow, you're quite
wrong, we got into the Rover and
motored as long as the petrol lasted.
We went as far as Paris and straight
into a fashion show. I say. those
models were quite the thing in my
school days, son. Son! Son! do you
hear me?"

Yea, pop. Gargle. Gar-gle. Gargle.
Gargle. Have another gin and bit-
tci‘s. pops."

“Thank you, my lad, as I was

saying, there we were in Paris.

"All at once this beautiful model
slithered up to me while I was sip-
ping my ubsynthc and said to me in
a (lulcite voicc, ‘Biibcc, 1e voila, here
I am.‘ Well. sir, I dropped my tea-
cup of nbsynthc. Then she said.
‘BubccH I know where you cull .gei

“All of ll sudden several nasty
looking gendurincs lcupcd out from
behind the Eiffel Tower and appro-
l‘cndcd the poor hiss shouting.
‘Storin lc Bastille. Vivc lc Campus
Chcstl' The Leftenant (Who w is

the rest of the absynthc into the
tank in lieu of petrol. Then off we
went, old chap, to visit the Thanks-
giving Holiday."

“Yea, yea, pops. garglc, gai'glc,
