All In The Game:

Change In
The Sports Scene

By JACK LEWIS

 

The AMIA football league was brought to a close on
Sunday afternoon when the league champs, Potter Club
and the All Stars slipped and sloshed to a scoreless tie in

the ﬁnal exhibition of the season.

Although there seem to be varying opinions on either
side who would have swamped who, had the ground been
dry, it was generally conceded that the score gave a fairly

accurate picture of the relative strength of each team.

The third quarter brought out the Potter offense as
the Club moved down to within two yards of the All Star's
goal, only to be held by excellent defensive play. In the
ﬁnal quarter the situation reversed as the All Stars took

to the air and gave the champs several breathless moments.
With the Stars last thrust being thwarted by lack of time,
another season closed out as this game provided the touch
of ﬁnality which seemed to be lacking in previous years.

Winter Program In Motion

Despite the loss of three of last season’s regulars, the
varsity wrestling squad appears conﬁdent of the forth-
coming season. The vacancies left by Paul Harris, Bob
Bosomworth and Joel Smith are now being adequately
ﬁlled by freshmen, Ox Brink, Mike Kessler, who has
a year‘s experience behind him, and heavyweight, Al
Jaquays. Lou Biolsi and Jerry Zappolo are expected to be
strong starters in the 147 and 177 pound classes.

Coach Sauers’ hoop squad also has its share of new-
comers in Tom Ryan, Eric Baumus and Bill Thompson,
returning after a year’s layoff. However these men will be
earring a large share of the reSponsibility when the season
gets under way. In Sauers‘ opinion this squad should easily
compare with last years team as far as the starting lineup
is concerned. However it will be lacking in needed depth.

In a meeting of the bowling captains on Wednesday
night two intramural leagues were set up. The ﬁrst a
handicap league will get under way on Tuesday while the
non handicap group is held off until the following week.

Congratulations to Marty Borko and Frank Fallace!

Mat Hopes In I958 Season

The latest edition of Joe Garcia's grapplers, depending
upon the performance of ﬁve returning lettermen and

nine newcomers for another

winning season, moved into

the ﬁnal stages of pre—season practice yesterday with only
eleven more days of practice remaining until the opener
in Page gym on December sixth.

The Feds have never had a losing
season. In 1955 they began their
ﬁrst year as a varsity sport and
ended the year with a 5-3 record:
this has been followed by 7-2-i and
7-3 seasons.

Fourth Year

In this, the fourth year of varsity
grappling, the inatmen will have to
bank heavily on the performance of
the returnees as well as some of the
freshmen who are out for the sport.

Charlie Kane should be a strong
bet for another great year; returning
as co-captain along with 123 pound
Joe Hill. he leads a crew including

Fallace, who scored fourteen of

broke the scoring record set by Bob
Backer two seasons ago midway
through the season when he hit for
his ninth goal. He scored all three

Marty Borko richly deserved the
