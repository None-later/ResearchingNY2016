From This Varﬁgﬂint:

20 Years Ago —
Same “Trash” As Today

 

By JIM DOUGHERTY
There I was happily sitting at my typewriter in the
News ofﬁce trying to dream up something cute to say for

all my fans this week. The

only idea I had brewing in

my imaginative little mind was “why do they call our
varsity teams the Peds?” Can’t this school be a little more
colorful? “Peds” isn't very ﬁerce and actually is only an
abbrieviation of some old Greek word that means teacher.

All of a sudden I became inspired
and my aforementioned imagina-
tive little mind decided to see what
i ad been said in the past about this
subject of a school nickname ttrite
as it may be).
Fate Was On My Side

I accidentally happened upon the
December 2. 1938 issue of this fain-
(.US iinfamous?) paper and noticed
Chuck Franklin's sports column. Not
being very good at paraphrasing I
decided to copy (notice quotation
marks).

My Big. Wonderous. Dynamic Idea

Somewhere along the way Albany
Business College "stole" our nick-
name of the “0WLS” and left us
with “Peds.”

What are we going to do about it?
Certainly we're not going to steal
from ABC. but are we going to be
content with such a nothing mon-
iker as the "Peds?"

Let‘s see what we can do about
changing our nickname. I think I
have a mailbox in the Commons (I

very delighted if someone respond-

Peds Give Hartford 67-56

‘Do It Yourself’ Lesson

BV 120 B KAM PF

1 Let's not wait for anyone else to do it, let’s do it our-
sc vcs.

These were the final words of Coach Dick Sauers be-
fore the opening tap of the Hartford game Tuesday night.
They could have been la. en in a number of ways but his
Peds took them to mean that he warned the Corn es icut
school's opener spoiled by defeat. And that it was 67—56
as the Albanians got off to a winning start in the l958—5Sl
season.

The Sauersmen. who have compiled a 45-19 record
over the pastthiee campaigns are on the road this week-

“ end for a two game stand in the New York
City area. Tonight at 7 pm, the Peds will
be in Jersey City. New Jersey where they
will meet Face College 01" Manhattan on
the ,St. Peter's College gym. Tomorrow
_ . afternoon the Albany quintet will move into
I imi.w.u- the Bronx to engage the New York Mari-
time College five at Fort Schuyler. Game time is two
o‘clock.
Line-Up

Sauer‘s starting line—up for tonight's fray will be the
same as Tuesday's; the familiar number 12, Gary Holway
at center, Denny Johnson. high scorer with 15 points in
the Hartford game and Don Cohen, 6’5 at forwards Tom
l-laughan, who sank six of seven ﬁeld goal ’
attempts Tuesday night and Eric Baumes,
newcomer to this year's squad at the guard
positions.

in Page gym without the service of coach .loc Garcia. whose ear infection has sidelined
him for three weeks already, but with five lcttcrincn back to face a Brooklyn Poly team
that has lost all but two of the group that succumbed to the Peds a year ago. .

Bob Bosoiiiwurth has been at the Fed hclin in Garcia‘s absence and will be coach—

point total came against tonight’s oppon-

94 counters. It was against this same team
three years ago that the Peds tallied 119
points for the Page Gym record.

Personnel

. Taking a look at thc men who till the Purple and Gold
uniforms this year. we can not fail to start with this year‘s
captain, Gary i-loiway. Holway has scored a State record
of 1404 points in three ciii'iipaigns and will, no doubt. break
the limo mark before the season grows too
old. 'l‘lic captain is 62': and hails from
Saranac Lake. Another returning lcttcr-
man is \Vatcrtown's Jack Bcarden. Bcarden
is the midget of the tcam, standing 5'9.
liclol'i‘ the schedule got under way. the set

ing from the starting line-up for a while.

_ ’I‘om Baughun is a Yonkers product and stands 6 feet
if inches tall. it was his field goal shooting Tuesday night
against l-iartford (six for seven) that proved a highlight
ill the PM opcncr. Coach Saucrs expects a lot from this
i‘ctiiriiing icttcrmun as he does from forward Denny John—
son. who lives in Jamestown and has proven his alliiii'ouiid
ability more than once since he joined the
team last January. An Albany product, Don

to the picture for the 1958—55) campaign.

Coach Saucrs has “dug deep”, has thought his team
at times to bc “fat, but thin" and “tall, but slow”, but he
came up with a winning combination Tuesday and has
his sights set on another NAIA bid in March. Good luck,
Sauersmen, see you next Friday in Page against New Paltz.
