By MARTY WARD

Tonight, December 5, in Page, IFG
will present the famous Student
Prince, the story of a Prussian sol-
dier, Karl. who was sent as a
prince-to-be to a University for a
training in social conduct. This
charmingly humorous story was
written by Dorothy Donnelly and
Sigmund Romberg.

The movie does not follow the
book exactly, but the main theme
and original songs are there, along
with three new songs written by
Nicolas Brodszky. These include “I’ll
Walk with God," which is sung to
the King of Karlsbad upon his
death.

Who, What and Where

The movie opens as the prince-
to-be enters as a parade-ground
Prussian soldier. He is then sent to
the Ui‘iivcrsity of Heidelberg. where
most of the action takes place.
While there he, like many State
students, begins to drink, and falls
in love with a barmaid, Kathie.

What the critics considered one
of the best moments of the entire
film occurs when the Students'

Chorus breaks into the song, “Drink,
Drink, Drink.”

The actors include: Karl—Edmund
Purdon and Mario Lanza. Kathie is
portrayed by Ann Blythe, the King
of Karlsbad, by Louis Calhern, and
the Tutor, by Edmund Gwenn.
Split Personality

Karl, as you have noticed, has a
split personality —— the acting of
Purdon and the voice of Lanza.
This movie is the climax of a quar-
rel between MGM and Mario Lanza.

The latter, overweight and very
tempermental, caused several post-
ponements in production and was
sued by the studio for $1,000,000.
The suit was settled out of court.

The studio then had the problem
of finding an actor to fit Lanza‘s
voice. Edmund Purdon was chosen.
The dubbing is expertly performed
and is almost imperceptible.

In short, take a break from your
homework and come to sec The
Student Prince. You'll have an hour
and forty-five mnutes of thorough
enjoyment, Remember, it's being
shown in Page, at 7:30 pm, on that
beautiful new Cinemascope screen.
