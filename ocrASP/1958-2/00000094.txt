By DAVE FELDMAN

Bravely I thrust myself into the
numbing winds as I left the house.
Icicles started to form on my wet
freshly combed hair as I walked
down the steps. Small stinging
flurries of wind—swept snow blinded
me while I fumbled for my car
keys. “Winter has come to Albany,
garden spot of the Far North,"
murmured as I slid over the freer.-
ing slipCovers.

I understand, having been iii-
formed by a very reliable source,
that if the cold and snow continue,
it is Very possible that Albany will
apply for permission to become the
fiftieth state in the Union-mthat is
the trend for wiiitery areas this
year, you know.

This same ultra-reliable source
has also informed your ever wary
reporter that Hawaii is a sure
thing for statehood. ’I‘hcy intend to
import one hundred >lli)\\'-llllll(lill{
machines from various skilllL’ resorts
in this country. They will then cov-
er the s‘usliori! and countryside
with n'ian-niade snow.

There is also a plan afoot in that
land to make paper-inache siiownii ii
to disguise the palm trees, spread
holly and good cheer and bring in
twenty-three husky teams. In this
way they hope to make the islands
for Northy.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY. DECEMBER 12. 1958

 

7/142 @ufdicle Wade!

BY THE BYSTANDER

Like most of the student body, the
Bystander has been goofing-off, so
to speak, in expectation of the
Christmas rci'css.

l'iinoticed Before

It has been an unusual week of
laxity on my part. for i made an
i-fl‘ort to come in from the Outside
World for a closer look at some of
thc [IIIIILS and pcoplc ri,ht around
the college, The observations made
by this columnist were things I had
ncxcr previously noticed around
State College.

(tool-()fi‘ Observations

So, lll keeping with the Christliias
scastn, and to continue the policy
oi "gooting-off" this week, let‘s take
a look at some of the observations
I made.

Hail. The Originator

l had tii't'll.\l(lii to stop by that
liy League dormitory, Salli-s Iiall.
'llic hull whci'c ihc orphans" Christ-
mos WIN“. ltlt‘.l til'l.‘lll.lltll last year

tomorrow's ii-liiiralioii loi tiic kids.
it's iiicc to see that llll‘ risl oi the

roaring fire in the Iireplacc, and a
lit‘ltllllllll stcrcophonic 1)I1ullu,il':ll)ll
lichnio out all types oi lllll.~l('. To top
it all oil, Mandy has a new haircut.

.‘lincrva‘s New Job

The Bystandcr‘s second obser'a-
lion was in the Draper llall rotunda,
whcre Mlllt'l'ltl, formerly goddess of
wisdom, has been demoted to a mere
M.1(ll.still Avenue advertiser. 'l‘hat

green bulletin board she's sporting
behind her hardly does justice to
one who is someone special at State.

Baby, It's (‘old Outside

A minor observation made by this
columnist came to the forefront as
we raced to a nine o'clock class on
a very cold Tuesday morning this
week. I want to know why State
College co-cds slow down their walk
when it's cold outside, instead of
speeding it up!?

(‘liristmcis Spirit—Wow!

The lower lounge of Briibacher
Hall is all decked out for Christmas.
if you care to inspect it, by all
means do so . . . but you had bet-
ti-r knock before entering!

Incognito Indefiniter

This columnist also noticed the
rapid rise of the new dormitory . , .
couldn't help but wonder when its
ioinpanion. the Western Ave. Resi—
dcncc Iltlll will pick up it more ap—
propriate name.

MEI“! Y CHRISTMAS

 

ﬂmauncemeul‘

Next Wednesday, Thursday
and Friday are the last three
days for interviews and registra-
tion at the Placement ()il'ice,
Draper 101. All bachelor or nias-
ter‘s degree -andidates for Jan-
uary, June or August, 195!) are
required to register and pay a
ten dollar service charge.

l'nless arrangements are made
for this registration. STOP
-ards will be issued to prevent
second semester registration.

State Facu/fy's
Book, Article

In the tradition of an academic
college, two of our faculty members
have recently had their writings
published. Edward P. Shaw, Prov
i'essor of Modern Languages, and
Catharine W. Peltz. Associate Pro-
fessor of English. have written a
book and an article respectively.
Docuir Shaw

Bookman Associates of New York
City has recently announced the
publication of li‘rancois-Augustin
I’aradis (le Monerif (1687-1770),
Shaw's latest book. Aided by a grant
from the Research Foundation of
the State University of New York,
he has attempted to exhaust all
manuscript material in French as
well as printed sources.

Moncrif was an eighteenth cen-
tury courtier and man of letters; he
rose from an impoverished bourgeois
childhood to become a member of
thc I'Tt'llt’ll Arudcniy, ll royal cen-
sor. an associate of Voltaire, and a
friend of innumerable mcnibers of
high Mit'lt‘ly including Madame de
Ponipaiiour.

Moiicrit's position in the literary
history of France has been indicated
as oliiei-tivcly as possible in this
lirst book-length study of him.
Doctor I’eltz

Catharine W. Peltz has an article
in the winter number of New York
Folklore, Quarterly. ft commemo-
rates the two hundredth anniver-
sary of Robert Biirns' birth.

It is entitled “A Salute to Robert
Burns: 1759-1959." Doctor Peltz re-
ceived her A.B, from this college
and her PhD. from Johns Hopkins
University.
