All Alec Guinness fans will be de-
lighted to learn that IFG will show
one of his finest dramatic perform-
ances in Draper 349 tonight at 7
and 9 pm.

Balkan Cardinal in the Prisoner

The Prisoner is the story of 8.
Cardinal of a nameless Balkan state
who has successfully fought the
Nazis only to be accused of treason
by the post-Nazi totalitarian gov-
ernment.

To the Editor:

The picture and sarcastic com-
mentary regarding faculty parking
in the November 14, 1958 Neivs in-
dicates a sudden interest in parkingr
efficiency. I should be interested to
learn where your photographer was
during the past years when faculty
cars were quite “considerately”
blocked in by students’ cars on the
very same FACULTY parking lot
shown in the photograph.

Could it possibly be that this so
called “hired attendant" has helped
students to observe the clearly
marked sign which states, "Parking
for Faculty and Staff Only"?

Sincerely yours,
Edward Berg, l’h. l).,
Asso. Professor of Biology.

To the Editor:

We take pleasure in announcing
that a poem. written by a stu-
dent of your college, has been
accepted for publication in the An-
nual Anthology of College Poetry:
A Dream, by Herbert Steven How—
ard.

The anthology is a compilation of
the finest poetry written by the col-
lege men and women of America,
representing every section of the
country. Selections were made from
thousands of poems submitted. We
heartily congratulate the student on
this honor.

Thank you for your continued in—
terest and co-operation in this work.

Cordially yours,
Dennis Hartman, Sec.,
National Poetry Association.

“confess” willingly to the charges.
Jack Hawkins is the brilliant psy-
chiatrist chosen to find the weak
spot in the Cardinal’s personality
and use it to destroy him.
Outstanding Performance

Alec Guinness’ portrayal of the
Cardinal is in some respects even
greater than his Academy Award
winning performance in Bridge on
the River Kwai.

Weak Plot

Although the movie is a pro—
foundly disturbing one, there are
certain weaknesses in the plot. The
psychological reasons given for the
Cardinal’s final breakdown and con-
fession seem rather weak and poorly
worked out. However, this is one
reviewer‘s opinion.

Recommended Movie

Certainly, there is some magnifi-
cent actiiig in The Prisoner. Jack
Hawkins is superb as the \i ‘toi‘ who
is defeated by his victim. The
scenes of the torture chambers and
the actual processes of brainwash—
log are frightening.

and dance instructors. At present
they are lacking several people in

their interest as Soon as it is con—
venient and possible for them to do
so.

While sifting through the papers
which came in during the week we
came acr055 the following gem from

To The Editors . . .

Today my responsibility

for the State College News

ends, and I turn this intangible burden over to you, Monica
and Beth. if some of our readers breath a sigh of relief
at this last statement, let it be known that I join them.
Nevertheless, this gives me an opportunity to be slightly

sentimental without people
radically over night.

thinking i have changed

1 wish that I could tell both of you how to avoid the

mistakes I have made, and I

admit (since this is my last

issue) that i did make a few—a very few, of" course. You

have worked on the News for

three years, but there is no

experience quite like being editor.

In "use you didn‘t already know, the job does have
prestige, but it also has a lot of other things that are not

quite so pleasant.

You get complaints; you have three

exams on Thursday and you have to be in the ofﬁce until
midnight Wednesday and then go home to write your
editorial before you can even start studying; you get com-
plaints; you can't find enough stories to fill the newspaper
and then sonic Il'zttc soul will bcsclgc you Friday to dis-
mvcr why the story he never gave you isn‘t on page 1; you
pct complaints; your stall" gcts deathly ill one week anti
you how to write the entire paper yourself; you get com-
plaints, your copy is sent to Boston by mistake and you‘re

in liudson until 1 a ill. writing fill and proofreadinc'

and

C) '

occasionally, of course. you get complaints.

But oddly enough thcsc Llllfigs make being editor more

Worthwhile than any prestige factor.

Nothing ever gave

me quite so much satisfaction as seeing people reading my
creation on Friday morning instead of” listening to their
professors lecture, especially when some or all of the ob—

stacles just mentioned had to be ovcrcome.

It is this sense

of accomplishment every week that makes you try it for

another week,

With this editorial the 43 Volume of the State College
News is closed and a new opened. May it be. a very success—

ful year for you both,

And if" you run into any snags i.

know an old editor who’d only be too glad to help . . .

 

RARY.
