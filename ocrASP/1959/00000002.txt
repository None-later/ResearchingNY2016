How Bad Are You?

One of the crusades of this paper for the last year has
been to find support for the deletion of the 2.5 average re~
quriement for Student Association officer candidates. The
Wednesday before Christmas vacation. after Senate has
passed an amendment 22-1 accomplishing just this objec-
tive, the members of S. A. voted on the same issue. The
The outcome was a defeated amendment. The two-thirds
vote necessary for passage was not reached.

All this past history points out several facts about our
Senate and S. A. First, Senate waited too long to pass the
amendment. We would hate to enumerate the number of
cently was brought before Senate and defeated. Faced
times and amendments similar or like the one voted on re-
with the practical realization that unless the average was
deleted or changed the candidates for President would
be fewer than usual, (if possiblel), Senate as last acted.
The advocates of “let’s give our new Constiution a fair
trial period” quickly changed their minds, and it looked
as if at last this needless qualification would be abolished.

And then the members of Student Association fooled
us. The defeat of the amendment can perhaps be attri-
buted to the lack of effective publicity about the issue.
But for a student senate that is supposed to represent the
students of the school, somebody goofed.

The Senate voted on the amendment missed unani-
mous passage by one vote. the S. A. vote was an exciting
close, but a miss is as good as a mile in our book. The
Senate has recognized the practical disadvantage of re-
quiring an average of S. A. candidates; the rest of the
student body obviously hasn‘t.

Obvious too is the lack of confidence S. A. has in
Senate. Considering that S. A. willingly gave so much
power to this small governmental group. it seems strange
that this proposal, so strongly supported by people sup-
posedly in the know, was defeated by those less worthily
endowed. If not strange, it is at best incongruous.

But the problem still remains as to who can and will
run for Student Association president. We wish we could
be around to see the ramifications of this amendment-Rs
defeat.

Look Here, Gang!

Before we leave this ivy-covered college, there are a few
questions whose answers escape us for the moment?

When will Residence Council give some report on the
progress they have made in recamping residence rules?

What scret formula will the new S. A. president (if
there is one) discover to see to it that cabinet functions
efficiently without people thinking it is an attempt to
usurp Senate’s policy-making powers? Better yet. how will
he get cabinet members to attend meetings?

Will the New Dorm be forever called the New Dorm?

What will happen to teaching over closed-circuit tele-
vision?

By how many points will we beat Siena tomorrow
night?

Why couldn’t we have a few days vacation between
wmwmm

Will Daddy Warbucks ever find Annie Rooney?

Aren’t you glad this is my last issue?

Well, Rary. it’s finally over and
you can relax again. The work is
over and what little sense of the
"glory of it all” you may have had
is behind you too.

It isn’t too easy to feel a great
sense of accomplishment when
you‘re. exhausted, but we hope you
won't mind being reassured that
this forty-third volume of the News
was a good one.

Perhaps we can all look at it
more objectively now that the work
is over and realize that this past
year's paper has accomplished a
great deal. Your editorship has been
successful if for no other reason
than that this year the News was
read.

No one can deny that this has
been a. rare and controversial year
for the paper; we would add that
if has been good for the paper. and
has prompted us to reassess our
work.

Despite the headaches. we hope
you‘ll remember the frisbee games
in the office. the arguments with
adamant Senators and irate Cabinet
ministers. the proofreading sessions.
and some of the better side of beingr
editor.

We hope that you can leave the
office with some feeling of achieve-
ment. Something of the paper will
leave with you. a sense of the fun of
writing for the News perhaps.

Finally we’ll say good luck and
have fun as you join the ranks of
past editors at the W. T.

To the Students:
December 1:”). 1958.

Our sincere thanks to all of the
students at Stale College who con-
tributed in any way to the over-
whelming success of the Christmas
party on Saturday. The children
came home eager to tell what a
grand time they had and to talk
about the college boys and girls
who "Minded" them at the party.
I think that :i great deal of the
happiness they experienced was due
lo the fact that they felt a personal
relationship toward the student or

 

 

students assigned exclusively to
them.
The Sisicrs who attended the

parly apparently enjoyed it as much
as the children. They are always
happy to see the children have a
good lime; to see the youngsters in
ii party situation is always a special
dclighl.

The planning of the party repre-
sented :i gread deal of work on the
purl of you. your committees. and
all of the participating campus
groups. Please convey our upprccia~
lion to all and assure them that
the children and Sisters of. St.
Coluiun's wish each and every one
the joys and blessings of llic Christ-
mars season.

May all of you have ii wonderful
