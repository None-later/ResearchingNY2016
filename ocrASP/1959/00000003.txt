STATE COLLEGE NEWS.

 

 

By The

“Wind, snow, sleet and hail. the
mail must go through.” Unfortun-
ater there was no wind. snow, sleet
or hall and so. . . .

“The News always comes out on
Friday!" If you've carefully read.
reread and re-reread these eight
glowing pages, you must be curious
now to wonder why the State Col-
lege News has not measured up to
its standards of excellence, and
strict adherence to outstanding
journalistic principals.

“Why,” you ask yourself. "do I
feel a void? What is the hole, the

emptiness that even the cafe-
teria coffee cannot fill this morn-
ing?"

We asked ourselves this yesterday
afternoon as gallantly we received
the news that our copy had not ar-
rived. Yes. children, readers, critics,
avid fans it has happened again.

If we were the kind to be easily
embittered. we would assault the
Albany and Hudson Post Offices

with many a well-turned phrase
and litter-airy thrust in choice
spoken English since there is no

other kind to our way of thinking.

Imagine our horror, further, to
discover that the infallible sports
editor had left his second copy
neatly tucked away in the bottom
drawer of his desk. Think too. of
our dismay when we remembered
that we had typed no carbon copy
of several of our more choice arti-
cics.

The picture of Frank Fallace, to
be found on page 6. was acquired
from an old passport lying around
the Immigration Office. It was no
mean task to get Jack Weaver to
pose without hands affixed to the
ends of his arms,

It is mete at this time, if at no
other, that copy be lost. What could
be a finer tribute to our Rare cdi-
tor than the opportunity of spend-
ing 12 stirring hours in that great
metropolis of Hudson with the
troubadors of the Register-Star. And
she had a date last night, too.

wayside

It is no less mete at this time
for us to thank the noble Joe
Szarek for neglecting to insert car-
bon between two sheets of paper.
Therefore, affording us the oppor-
tunity to compose this expose of
subversive activity in the Albany
Post Office.

In conclusion. we, the Four
Horsemen of that great apocolypse
the State College News (as you read
the above line kindly stand on top
of a chair and shout) would like to
muse on the relative value of pub-
lishing a weekly newspaper under-
mined and aligned by a student
body that can't estimate journal-
istic endeavors.

Realize now, if you can, the de-
votion, the valor. the courage, the
integrity, the loyalty. of we forth-
right members of the fourth estate
who choose to dedicate our lives
to the typewriter, the linotypc, and
the printed page.

Friday."

News Poll Results Disclos:
Program Starts You Love Us And Hate Us

The results of the poll taken by
members of the State College News
Board have been tabulated and read
according to Mary Fitzpatrick ’59.
Editor-in-Chief.

General opinion centered around
editorials and sports material. In
popularity the editorials were rated
first and sports second. However,
the same departments were also
rated least popular.

Polls were submitted by faculty
members and undergraduate and
graduate students of the college.
Approximately 320 were returned to
the Board.

What Did You Like?

Rating of columns showed that
the Cominon—Stater is the most ens
joyed with Kapital Kapers running
second. Because of strong adverse
opinion Cinema Sidelights will be
dropped from the paper. Also out
of favor with some are Poring Over
the Exchange and Kapital Kapers.
No decision has been made on these
columns yet.

The weekly cartoons received a
half-hearted vote from the student
body. and the policy of devoting two
pages to sports news was generally
accepted.

Of those polled an average of
nincty—ninc out of a hundred read
the editorials in the News, but few
are willing to write a letter to thc
cdilor. For the benefit of the latter
group the procedure includes :id-
drcssing the letter To the Editorz,
and all icttcrs must be signed. They
can be dropped in the editor's stit-
dcnt. mail box or the box on the
News bulletin board. Signatures will
be withheld upon request.

Pictures And Faculty

The use of more pictures on cur-
rent activitics was requested by the
students. A column on the faculty
was faVorcd by some and will be
tried in a short time on a tempor-
ary basis.

The articles on Senate and the
Cabinet were both rated as being
read by the school. Opinion on finite
features was split fairly cvcnly.
Controversy

One of the most C(llltrlll't't‘,i,t[
questions on the poll was tho on
paying the editor. Approxiindttlv

How To Pass

In ill-omened days such as these
it has become almost a matter of
course for such an article as this
to morbidly dwell of final exami—
nations. This, if you care to read
further, will be no exception.

The prime reason for tth em-
phasis upon finals is that there is
really nothing of great interest a-
round here worth the writing. Ex—
cept. perhaps, the return to school
which is even more morbid and dc-
pressing). Hence; forward, dautlcss

for added color) necessarily so.

Modern Science has found a way
to pass tests without all that early-
iii-the—semestcr bother. There are
many prescriptions on the market
to enable the student to stay awake
for forty-eight hours or so.

Thus the ambitious, but lazy stu-
dent can make up for all that work
that he (lid not do early in the
semester.

The only problem with this
method is that the effect of the

prescription may wear off during
the test. When this happens the
user usually goes rapidly. and
sometimes noisilv to sleep. This
could be tragic.

Finally

in a national magazine article on
this subject :i very interesting and

AD Prepares

Of The Season

Dr. Jarka Burlan, Associate
Professor of English announces
that the class in Advanced Draina-
tics has the preparations for their
filial presentation well under way.
The last play for the season will be
Escurial by the French playwright,
Ghelderhodc.

Director Robert Helwig ’60. will
be assisted by Arlcen Emery ‘61. The
play will be presented Wednesday
or Thursday. January 1-1 and 15, at
8 pin. in R-291.

The play is a combination of the
stylistic and expressionistic types
of theater. The king, who vacillates
between sanity and insanity. is ob—
sessed with the idea that a court
jester is a competitor for the love
of the quccn. The strange relation—
ship between the king :ind the court
jcstcr provides the intriguing qual-
ity of the play anti the bizarre ac-
tion of the drama.

The parts will be played by the
following: Klaus Kaufman will por-
tray lhc part of the king and Ken-
nclh Burmcistcr will be the Execu-
tioner. The two are both Seniors.
Daniel l.chilic ’62, is the Jester,
and Grant Duffrin '61. is thc Monk.

At a recent meeting of the Aca-
demic Council the following new
courses and course changes were ap-
proved:

Mathematics

Math 25 is to become an integrat-
ed course in Analytics and Calcu-
lus. Courses to be discontinued are:
Math 28. 212, 222. 328. Advanced
Calculus I, Math 128; Advanced
Calculus II, Math 228; Introduction
to Abstract Algebra, Math 221 are
the new courses to be offered.
