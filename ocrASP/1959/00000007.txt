Un’acdlstomed' As We Are ..

We’ve talked to a lot‘of people this week and been
asked innumerable times—if we were putting out a paper,
what it would be like, and what. kind of a paper ours would
be. The paper itself answers the ﬁrst two questions, and
we’d like to attempt toanswer the third. "

We cannot deﬁnitely say we will be either radical or
canservative; we have set no strict policy to be followed
in every situation. As far as school politics are concerned,
we will attempt to see things with an objective and critical
eye, to communicate our own opinions and those of others
to the student body.

One of the most important things we want to do is
to act as an organ of communication within the school
and a link to activities outside the campus. We feel that
there are many issues concerning the college and education
in- general that should be presented to the students, and
will be in the News.

If you have complaints about our paper, tell us, not
your friends. We’ll be glad to hear them and tell you our
feelings on the subject. Send us letters, tell us your own
pelitical opinions, submit your articles, cartoons, etc., come
in and and see us some Tuesday or Wednesday night.

The News is the college and the students’ paper; we
expect you to use it to its fullest capacity, and we hope to
present to you a complete picture of the campus.

Thimk!

Because declinations are not ﬁnal until Monday, the
News can not print the list of candidates running for ofﬁce
in this issue. However, because you do not have the list
of candidates in this morning’s paper does not mean that
you shouldn’t know who is running before you enter the
voting booth next Friday or Monday. It is your duty as
a_ voter, and no doubt a chief critic of student government,
to ﬁnd out who the candidates are, what their qualiﬁca-
tions are, and then to decide for yourself whether you think
they can d i the job. Think for yourself! Vote as an in-
dividual, for an individual; not as a member of a group,
for a member of the group.

Freshman—you are picking the leaders of your class MT

and your school for the ﬁrst time. Remember, if you don’t
feel the candidates are qualiﬁed, you can turn in a blank
ballot. The frosh are important because they are the
future government of this school; the Sophomores are in
the middle; and the Juniors are the present—they’re run-
ning it for the most part. Pick leaders you know and
believe in! Go to the election rally and ﬁnd out what the
candidates are advocating.

The voting machines will be a novelty which will
attract many voters, we hope. But, don’t ruin your govern-
ment by pulling keys on the voting machines and not
knowing whom you are electing.

Candidates—remember to turn in preference slips by
4 o’clock Monday afternoon if you are running for more
than one ofﬁce. If these are not turned in you are im-
mediately disqualiﬁed from running.

STATE COLLEGE »-NElNS. FRIDAY. FEBRUARY’G. 1959

 

 (open .
By Gebhardt a Pasquerella

After sleeping throug the latest
IFG ﬁlm (its not your fault-group,
it was supposed to be good) we are
coming into this column with noth-
ing but pure resentment for the
movie world. The movie was path-
etic, with bottles of instant tears
ready for those sadists who preferred
0 contain their emotions.
STRAND

Rally Round the Flag Boys—It
pains us to say this, but the ﬁlm-
dom version of Max Shulman’s best
seller is destined to be one of the
ﬁnest comedies of the year. Paul
Newman loses all of the complexes
that he acquired in “Hot Tin Roof”
and turns in a ﬁrst class perform-
ance.

The scenes on the bureauracy of
the army are particularly effective.
(Please don’t be alarmed, fans, al-
though it sounds like we have seen
this movie in actuality we happened
to have thumbed through the
Classic's Illustrated edition of this
movie while sitting in the library.)
MADISON

Song of Bernadette—This movie
has been revived because of public
demand. We are not saying that
this movie is old. but in this latest
edition sound has been added.
LELAND

Tarawa Beachhead—Thrill to the
screams of Banzi, see the ﬂame
throwers consume human life in
glorious blood color. Feel the emo-
tion when the young hero writes
his girl that last letter. just before
stepping on a broken coke bottle.
Hear the National Anthem and
Marines Hymn sung by dying native
children.

PALACE

Some Came Running—Frank Sili-
atra, Dean Martin, Shirley Mac-
Laine.

See exciting scenes never before
filmed! Never before have so few
tried to do so much. Dinnertime
at Brubacher Hall! Never before
have so many eaten so little! See
Bru Stew in technicolor! Hear Bru
steak in stereophonic sound!

Seven Cities of Antarctica—Walt
Disney does it again! Actually fans
all it is. is a remake of The Living
Desert, done inside a frozen food
locker.

 

Z
I Want to Live—Susan Hayward
stars in this bottle studded sequel
to I'll Cry Tomorrow. After every
showing the ushers pass out chlor-
ophyll gum and spray the theatre
with air wick.

 

There will be a. meeting, Tues-
day, at 8 p.m., in the News Room
for all students interested in
working on the Feature Staff of
the State College News. an-
nounces David Feldman '60,
Feature Editor.

All students who desire to
write humorous stories, poems,
human interest articles, or any-
thing else in the realm of “fea-
tures" are invited.

The National Science Foundation
will support three State University
teachers colleges in conducting sum-
mer institutes this year. The objec-
tive of the institutes is to improve
the competence of the participating
teachers and supervisors in science
and mathematics.

The College for Teachers at Al-
bany has received two grants: one
of $46,500 for an institute for high
school teachers of mathematics and
one of $47,900 for an institute for
high school teachers of science. The
funds are administered by the Re-
search Foundation of State Univer-
slt)‘.

The science institute at Albany
offers six courses from which each
student will choose two. The pro-
gram lncludes Microbiology, Ecol-
ogy, Biochemistry, Physical Chemis-
try, Nuclear Physics, and Alternat-
ing Current and Electronics. It is
designed to assist secondary school
teachers of science to broaden their
background in the subject and to
add to it a knowledge of modern
and advanced materials. The courses
run from June 29 to August 8.

Participants in the mathematics

from among the six offered: Fouri-
