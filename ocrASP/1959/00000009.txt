STATE COLLIGI NIWB. FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 6. 1959

Pecls Clash With Oswego, The Has Beens

Hobart On Weekend Trip And I.U.’s Hold 

By non mama:

Sausersmen will leave the city of
the Albanians this weekend, and
travel north in their quest for vic-
tory over Oswego and Hobart. “Our
team will be held together with
tape, cough syrup and band-aids,"
states coach Sauers. Eight of the
eleven players will be handicapped
with everything ranging from a
sprained ankle to a case of tonsilitis
as they face tough competition from
the Lakers this evening. The Oswe-
go cagers rank first record-wise in
State University Teachers Colleges
competition, having lost one game in
twelve starts, that to LeMoyne at
the beginning of the season. Ron
Davis will head the fast breaking
green and white squad with a 28.2
average and quick action on the
backboards.

New And Old Faces

Paul Howard, long awaited by
the team, became eligible for var-
sity ball as of last week. Howard,
former All-Albany shooting star,
will prove to be a bulwark offen-
sively as well as defensively. Play-
ing JV ball last semester, Paul

wound up a ten game stint with a
15.1 average and 89 rebounds.

The question whether Don Bear-
den would play ball second semester
was a popular one throughout the
first semester. It was answered at
the BPI game last week, when Don
“Lefty” Bearden appeared on the
Page hardwood in uniform. Due to
the “retirement” of Denny John-
son, Tom Ryan, and Bob Sands,
coach Sauers drafted Pat Splcci
and John Wallace from JV level on-
to varsity. Coach stated that “both
these boys liaVe poise and ability,
and will probably see some action
in the following games."

Line Up

Starting tonight will be the fam-
iliar Gary Holway, Don Cohen, Tom
Baugham, Paul Howard and Bill
Thompson. Thompson moved up to
the starting rank last week and dis-
played hustle and accurate shoot-
ing as he racked up fourteen points
against the Engineers. The Bettrden
brothers and Eric Baumes will see

 

limited action this weekend due to
injuries. With the gathering of four
new players, Batters believes that
the team has become equally strong
in zone and Littll to man defense.
Howard will compensate for the loss
of Denny Johnson in the shooting
field. The latter who totaled 141
points in eleven games was the
team’s second high scorer for the
first half of the season.

Hobart Unpredictable

Whether or hot Hobart will prove
to be tough competition is as yet
unpredictable. At latest report the
Hobart statesmen lost to Oswego in
an overtime and were defeated by

RPI by five points. The team’s cap-
tain, Tom Wetzel, suffered an in-
Jury in the first part of the sea-
son, but will be back on the court
to face the Feds.

Up To Date

The Feds stand on solid ground
with a 9-3 record, having beaten
BPI, 103-66. Two weeks ago, Page
was the setting for this year's most
exciting game as the Sauersmen
succumbed to New Haven, 73-72, in
overtime. This unexpected event
broke State's three year home win-
ning streak. Savers stated that this
game would have been a definite
Willi had Jack Bearden been avail-
ab e.

Next Wednesday the State quin-
tet will meet the New Paltz Hawks
at New Paltz. Last year's upset
proved to be an entry in Sauers'
book of nightmares. Let’s make this
one a front page story in his “book
of dreams."

FirslL By Two

The Has Beens have finally cop-

ped first place by virtue of a 4-0 ‘

win over second place KB. The run-

which won its first game last week.

Who knows, this could be their big ’

push from the cellar. Tom Sullivan
helped APA pull the Gutterdusters
down from second to third place
with a series high of 611. This puts
Tom in first place with an average
of 187 pins per game. SLS found

itself in fourth place with that up-

setting loss to Potter.
Handicap League

The Handicap League now shows ,
a new top team, the I.U.‘s, who by "

taking three out of four games
from the Old Men, leaves them two
games their better. The Vikings
who hold down third place were the
first team to lose a series to Soyles.
Sayles again was paced by Claude
Frank who bowled the high game
of 201.

Maxon with several members of his

Enioys Teaching

By JIM nocormn'rv
Hammondsport, Jan. 30, 1959 . . . Carl Maxon, Albany
State ’58, has found his ﬁrst four months of teaching all

that he had hoped it would be . . . challenging, rewarding,
and a real learning process for himself.

 

Carl, who is teaching senior high math at Hammonds- 
port Central School, says, “I enjoy working with the kids. r'

There’s something new each day and it’s fascinating to
see the learning process I read and heard so much about
really going on.”

Junior Class Advisor

“I think my favorite subject is trig, because it is the 5
most advanced course. My students are really interested '
and are eager to learn.” Carl also teaches two classes in 
algebra, one in geometry and one in intermediate. Besides 
his scholastic duties, he is one of two advisors to the Junior '

Class. “We have just had a very successful J unior-Senior
Prom. Our class rings have also arrived after much hurry
and scurry of choosing the design, getting the correct size,
initials, etc. The class is also about to take over a project
of sponsoring Thursday evening movies at the school.”
Varsity Soccer Coach

Voted outstanding soccer player and captain in 1957
by his Albany teammates, Carl has especially enjoyed
coaching soccer at H’port Central. He organized the ﬁrst
soccer team the school has had in three years. And that
team took 3rd place in the Steuben County ﬁnals! In
league games, H’port won 5 and lost 5; a good standing
for a brand new team, states Maxon.

Carl, with his wife Carol and 8-month old daughter
Debbie, lives in a charming apartment near the head of
Keuka Lake. The Maxons have entered into the life
of the community and are regular attenders at the First
Methodist Church and its events. Mrs. Maxon has joined
the community’s Home Bureau.

“Teaching Is For Me”

“Teaching is deﬁnitely the profession for me and so
far I am enjoying everything about it,” concludes Carl
Maxon, another successful State alumnus.

 Season‘s Worst Blow Comes

As Charlie Kane Withdraws

By DAVE MILLER.

Already reeling under the weight
of three consecutive losses, Albany
State’s matmcn this week began
the long search for somebody to fill
the shoes of one of the all time
greats in college wrestling history—

“ a Norwich boy who lost only once
" in his twenty-four match career

spanning two and one-half seasons.

After an exam period layoff, the
AlviIA Basketball Schedule is head—
ud into the home stretch. Page Gym

week with each team trying to see
its much action as they can before
the season closes.

Iii ii contest hour the first lea-
gue on Monday, the Old Men down-
ed Saylcs I in 11 close game. The
tinul score was the Old Men 52,
Sayles l 48. High man of the game
was Tom Ellis of Sayles I with 29
points. Leaders for the Old Men
were Dilliam and Dunhinn with 18
and 16 respectively.

From the second league on Mon-
oziy, EEP topped the Leftovers, .54
to 27. High man in this contest was
Chuck Recesso from EEP With 14
pomts.

AISo on Monday, Duffy’s Dunkers
rolled over Jackson House, 49 to 23,
illlti the 'i‘crroi's dumped the Cous-
crs, 51 to 25. Dibble ior the Terrors
scored 24 points as high man in that
game.

On the following (lily, Tuesday,
Silleh I again saw action. This
time Potter was their opponent.
The final score was Potter 139,
Saylcs 31. Tom Ellis of Saylcs was
ligillll high man of the game with
ill points. High for Potter wus last
year's varsity man John McDon-
ough, tallying 10 points.

squad, faced with two home matches
in two days, will need all the help
it can get for the remainder of this
season to begin the rebuilding job
for next year. The Pods face Clark-
son, who they beat in a 16-18 thrill-
er last year at Ciarkson, this after-
noon at 4:00 and tomorrow face
Paul Smith College at 3:00; both
are “do or die” matches for the be-
leaguered grapplcrs.

Kane may return, and if he does
it will be welcome news for Joe
Garcia and his squad, next year.
His departure climaxes a season
that has been plagued with in-
juries and bad breaks.

The only loss for the popular co-
captain came at the hands of MIT
in his freshman year when he drop-
ped a decision as the Feds lost by
a 13~19 score. He went on to win
sixteen more in a row before he left
and in his twenty-four matches
compiled a total of ninety-seven
points. Forty-six of these points
came in an undefeated Sophomore
season.

Fast Worker

His quickest pin marked his initial
appearance on the collegiate scene
as he won his first match on De—
cember 3, 1956, by a. pin in 36
seconds. He often pinned his men
in the first period.

The impact that Kane's loss will
have on the team will go far beyond
the points he might score, for
Charlie was confidence personified
on the met. The fans, players, and
Charlie knew that he would “get
his man” and soon his opponent re-
alized it, too. His teammates elect—
ed him co—captain as they named
him most valuable wrestler last sea-
son and Charlie’s leadership re-
warded their confidence in him.

The Feds have had their share of
problems without this loss to swal-
low. The season began with coach
Joe Garcia in the hospital and by
good fortune there was Bob Bosom-
worth on hand to take over coaching
chores. Heavyweight A1 Jaquays was
injured; Joe Hill was injured; in-
experienced men had to fill in at
several weight classes.

Look To The Future

Now the squad must look forward
us the remainder of the season will
be one of rebuilding. This does not
mean that there will not be some
great matches, for there will be,
and today at 4:00 Clitrkson will be
on hand to provide the opposition.
