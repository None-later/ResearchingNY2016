STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 13. i959

 

insinuating? . . .

. . We hesitate to call the student body a bunch of nosey
1nd1v1duals, liars, thieves, and careless busybodies. How-
ever . . .

. This week we requested activities sheets from about
thirty 1nd1v1duals. These were to be handed to us person-
ally or put in our Student Mail by 5 pm. Tuesday.
Many of them were. Many were late because the students
“forgot.” Still others were placed in Student Mail and
never found by us. We’d like to believe that these lists were
placed 1n the mail, but if they were, what happened to
them? The mail placed in those boxes is directed to the
person to whom it is addressed, not to anyone who cares
to read it, censure it, and acquire it. If the mail drops on
the ﬂoor, for heavens sake, pick it up. That mail may be
important to some people, as it is to us.

Now that we’re on the subject of Student Mail—are
those boxes ever cleaned out? The Smiles meeting was two
weeks ago!

Who's Aware? . . .

‘ Reading the News this week you’ve undoubtedly no—
ticed a predominance of personal opinion. Never one to
vary from an established pattern, we'd like to offer a few
of our own.

.In the ﬁrst place you‘ll observe the prevalence of
typical campaign procedure, give the voter what he wants
and ‘tell him what he’d like to hear. For instance, every-
one it seems is deeply concerned with making the student
“aware”; not to cast aspersions on noble causes—but how
many of our beloved students want to be aware? Beyond
knowmg what Common-Stater is inferring and understand-
ing the current joke, the “average” State College student
doesn’t really care.

Unquestionably more people are interested in student
government this year than in previous elections. You‘ve
only'to look at the long lists of candidates to be fully
cognizant of that fact. But how many of those candidates
are running with serious intentions, and how many are
“aware” of what’s going on themselves? ‘

We don’t really believe that the candidates know what
the voters want. The issues presented are thing voters
should want, of course, and should be interested in. But
there’s a plurality, the well-known “they,” who don’t even
know there‘s a camp, a cabinet or what—have-you.

Furthermore, how many of our distinguished candi-
dates have investigated these thorns in the college’s side?
We couldn’t help but notice a “Junior Class Senator“
candidate who would plan our paper for us, and set up a
Student Communications Commissioner; we think it‘s a
lovely idea—~but where will all the news come from for
an SA page, when will the Senators write it, and just what
happens to the Minister of Publications?

Our presidential candidates are both proposing e.\'~
tending communication, but we ask—how? Who reads
bulletin boards or every word of the paper? Are you going
to talk to everyone individually? Again we sav many peo-
ple don‘t want to be aware! - '

This year’s campaigning seems aimed toward the stu-
dent who isn’t interested in school politics. But this is
the student who never picks up his student mail, never
votes, never looks past the SIS. list on the bulletin board.
He won‘t know you‘re advocating making him aware. and
if he did he’d probably beg to be left alone.

Our point then is this: isn‘t it rather futile to attempt
communication with people who just won‘t be communi-
cated with? Couldn't campaigning be more eil‘ective if
it were directed toward efﬁcient operation of government
for and by the decision makers? Shouldn't a good contest
involve some meaty, controversial, practical issues so that
the “aware” voter can make his decision on the basis oi"
his personal convictions, instead of on personality? And
ﬁlnallty, shouldn‘t n 'undidatc know what he’s “talking
a mu '.’

(druid! Karma

By Gebhardt & Pasquerella

Will you please excuse this column
this week. We were forced to write
' amid the speeches, singing and
other bunch of total nonsense that
has existed in the Student Union
this week. If these sororities would
spend one—tenth of the energy to
do something constructive that they
have used in presentingr the garbage.
this would be a much better school.
And we emphasize the word gar—
bage.
