And Where
Are Held

By JOHN moan

Voting Machines in Lower Draper

Where can you vote? The ma-
chines will be set up in the counsel-
ing rooms in lower Draper. Members
of Election Commission will super-
vise the voting.

We have made posters, written
letters, used the verbal technique.
and now resort to writing an article
in order to get you out to the polls.
Now it's up to you.

Remember! Yom' future govern-
ment leaders will be dealing with
problems as the college camp, stu-
dent facilities, academics, rivalry,
and most important—the STU-
DENT TAX. All of these matters
pertain to you. They all affect you!
What are you going to do about
them?

Today and Monday. These are the
days you can voice your opinion in
student government. See you at the
polls.

“Buck Socials"

There are many things that can
be accomplished by a dynamic exe-
cutive. I think there are functions
which could be incorporated in the
social calendar to provide the stu-
dent body with a more complete
selection of social activities. It is
entirely possible to arrange cliaper-
oncd “BUCK SOCLALS" on week-
end nights und provide dancing and
beverages anti "just plain fun." The
proceeds from the “buck socials"
could be used for such things as:

1. Presenting more small jazz

groups .)11 Sunday afternoons.
2.1l’lslaiiill'5 an FM. system in
the cafeteria.

, Supplying and supervising vol-
leyball :ilid badminton on
Dorm Fir 1d.

4. An SA. picnic at Dippikill.

Tin-sc are some of the ideas that
could materialize if I am elected
and receive sul-staniial support from
the student body. I'll write half of
the platform: you, the students,
write the other half

Who knows, we nay even be able
to check the iil'L‘ extinguishers.
