By JIM DOUGHERTY

The world of sports again comes into focus after
hectic week of posters, speeches, rallys, more posters and season against Harpu
more speeches. Due to the amount of confusion and other night in Schenectady,
interests being pursued this time of year, I will not at- visiting team have played to
tempt to editorialize on any particular subject. It would present very tough oppositio

probably get lost in the shufﬂe, so instead I’ll forge ahead
with the real purpose of this paper in mind and communi-
cate those things that I feel will be interesting to a good

majority of you.
Un-Ofﬁcial Sports

There is one “sport” here at State that is not con-
trolled by the Athletic Department, is not listed in the
college catalogue, and is not governed by a set of common
rules. Hell-Week, however. really is a sport. It can be so
classiﬁed because it dcvelopes sportsmanship, provides
exercise, stirs up school spirit, and is composed of two

different segments.

What do you say ex-pled

Sisters vs. Pledges.
ges. Did you have fun this

week? And, what about last night? I’ll bet that was quite
interesting. You have won a victory, though. The fact
that you have completed your pledge period and are now
eligible for initiation is, in fact, a great victory. It is one

that you will always remember.

Hell-Week is a “sport”

true, but it is also very serious.

From The Sports Desk:

I saw Frankie Fallace play

to use his hands in this particular sport . . . This was also
one of the rare times I have seen Owen Dav1s wear shoes

while engaging in athletics
