.STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 20. 1959

4W4 0/ State

 

By ELAINE ROMATOWSKI

State College is getting up in this
world—with voting machines, full
scale campaigning, and posters of
every size and shape proclaiming
their wares to the pedestrians of the
peristyles. If one didn't know better,
one might think that this was truly
a politically minded campus.

When election time at State draWs
near, the only students who give a
thought to qualiﬁcations, averages,
or experience are the candidates.
The average student voter tends to
base his decision on popularity,
dates, and/or good looks. Or per—
haps, if he is in a hurry, he will
pull the lever near the name closest
to him; sometimes. if he is in too
much of a hurry, he won't bother
to vote at all. t

A further proof of disinterest ill
politics on the part of the student
body lies in the fact that there is
still only one political party or-
ganized as of now. Granted, of
course, that most of the upperclass-
man candidates are well

enough not to need the support of
all organized body, the fact still re-
mains that the underclassmen, espe-
cially the Sophomores are not the
least disturbed by this one-sided
battle.

The members of the class of '61
will be the backbone of the school
next year. Yet they seem to he the
ones who take the least interest ill
the election of their ofﬁcers. Most
of their candidates for ofﬁce don‘t
even bother to campaign! As far as
I can see. their election ballots
should be labeled “Popularity Poll."

Maybe it's a “Sophomore Slump,"
but more likely it’s plaill, old—fash-
ioned DISINTERESI‘! iThought I
was going to say “apathy.” didn't
you?) What does interest the
Red Devils? How many Soph-
omores work on tile News? How
many are ill the State College Re-
vue? The Juniors this year had over
thirty candidates for Myskallia.
Next year‘s Juniors will be lucky if

knownthey can manage to dig up three.

Garciamen Take On Lakers;
MeetL Union On Wednesday

By DAVE MILLER

‘  revamped edition of the team that lost to Farleigh
Dickinson by a 22-10 score a week ago in Page Hall gym

to face the strong Lakers in

a 2:30 match that will pit the Peds against two of the
section’s best wrestlers in the annual mat meeting of the

two schools.

The Lakers sport unbeaten Joe Farmer ill the heavy-
weight bracket and 147 pounder Pat Augustine, who was

decisioned by Charlie Kane

two years ago, as well as a

deceptive 2—3—1 record that includes a tie with RPI and
wins over University of Buffalo and a Canadian school.

llill, Kessler Score

The State ten points ill the FDU
match came via a pill by Joe Hill
and a forfeit will by Mike Kesslci'.
whose opponent did not appear, ill
the 177 pound class. The match also
marked the initial appearance of
Lou Biolsi, who wrestled ill place
of injured Don Warne, and Paul
Villami, a heavyweight, aild the
first home appearance of 130 pound
Jay Katzel whose previous effort was
a win at Dartmouth.

For the Peds this will be the filial
road trip for the season aild the
semi-filial match of the year. with
the end coming 011 Wednesday of
next week when the grapplers enter-
tain Union iii Page gym at 4:00. The
Wednesday match is tllc return of
an upset victory by Union a year
ago alld one that the Peds would
very much like to take.

Finale For Hill

For Joe Hill, the match Wednes-
day will mark the end of three years
of gallant perforlllallce and scrappy
competition on the part of the 123
pound senior from Fabius, New York.
In his first year on the team Hill
was forced into the background by
Toni Farrell aild all he got for a full
season of sweat in the practice room
was one five poillt appearance. He
stuck with the game however, alld
as a Jullior became State‘s regular
123 pounder and kept this position
as a Senior. It would be most fitting
if, on Wednesday, this match were
dedicated to the scrappy grapplcr
from Fabius whose show of constant
determination and courage won him
the captainship in his Senior year.
Warne Returns

Recovered from a shoulder injury
that plagued him earlier ill the sea-
son, Doll Warne, a Sophomore from
Spencer, New York, returns to his
post ill the 147 pound class this
weekend aild should wrestle against
Ullion on "Joe Hill Day" Wednes-
day, 4:00, iii Page gym.

Team Spirit At Best

The return of Don Bearden prov-
ed to be all omen to the Sauersmen.
as team spirit rose to its peak last
week ill the Pratt game. "Don’s pres-
ence has certainly done something
to better the team's attitude" stated
Sauers. “If we can keep up our
spirit to where it is now, we will
prove to be tough opposition at the
tourney next week."
Devils Damper Peds

On Wednesday night the Fed

per cent and coming up to six poillts
behind the Connecticut Teachers
College. Cohen who is “finally liv—
iilg up to his promises" took hon-
ors, hitting 23 points and taking 14
rebounds. Doll, usually playing on
the inside, switched his offense aild
took seven of the nine sinkers from
the outside of the circle. Holway
seconded with 18 poillts and 11 re—
bounds.

Sauersmen
Travel North

 

By JIM DOUGHERTY

The bulk of the present national basketball talk con-
cerns itself with league championships and tournament
invitations. On this campus we don’t belong to a league
for which we can win a championship, but we do have a
tournament invitation. Coach Dick Sauers and his Peds
are setting their sights on the New York State Teachers
College Invitational tourney at Oswego.

Sauersmen Go North Next Week

State has been notiﬁed that it will be one of the eight
teams to participate in the event to be held Feb. 26, 27
and 28. At this time, the high-ﬂying Peds will seek to
better last year’s ﬁfth place finish. Host team Osweg‘o is
the defending champion and Cortland is favored to cop
this year’s honors. Cortland was the victor of the inaugural

tournament in 1957.
State Seeded Near Top

The eight teams to appear ill their present order of
seeding are: Cortland, Osweg‘o—Albany (tie), Buffalo, Platts-
burgh, Geneseo, Brockport and Oneonta. The ﬁnal seeding
will be based on the Dunkel ratings for this week. By
Monday, the Sauersmen should know who will be their
opposition in the Opening round.

Opening round games will pit those teams seeded as

follows: 1—5, 2-6, 3-7 and 4-8.

Big-Time News: Oscar Robertson, a Cincinnati Junior
and 1958 All-American, has established a new school scor-
ing record. In his last outing the “Big O" scored 43 points
to surpass the all time school record held by NBA pro star,
Jack Twyman. Robertson has scored 1612 markers ill 47
games for a 34.3 average. Twyman‘s record was 1598 points
in 90 games. The books show how it was Robertson that
made the Bearcats an overnight national powerhouse.
