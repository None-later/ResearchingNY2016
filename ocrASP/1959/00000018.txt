“They did it again today. ch?"
She smiled wistfully at the front
door while I balanced my note-

book on her right foot.
“Yes. Minnie, but it's not
what you think. They don’t

dress in white for this. they save
that part for spring."

“No,” she protested. “I know

what it is; it isn't any different
from what it was in 1916. or
1945."

"Did they have apathy then

too?" I couldn't help lint ask.

“Oh well. they've always had
that oil" and on. but it gets bet-
ter. Say. you know this spear is
getting heavy. d'ya think maybe
one of this year's would. uh.
‘makc it lighter for me‘." a.
gleam appeared in her eye.

"Sorry, Minnie. they don't do
things like that around here
anymore. We're all kind of uh
conservative nowadays. Lest all
our. tili. ‘rabble rousers‘."

"I was afraid of that, lint I
guess it can‘t be helped. Well, I
guess I can relax again for a
while." She leaned her noble
head on her spear. anti I left
her to her memories.

ALBANY. NEW YORK. FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 27.

VOL. XLIV. NO. 5

 

' Sauersmen

By DAN LABEILLE

On Wednesday night, Coa ch
Satiet‘s. the team, a manager and a
very eager reporter boarded the.
Bohl's Scenic Touring Bus. Their
destination was Oswego, N. Y. Here
the Feds were seeking to re-write the
iccord books of the New York State
Teachers- College Invitational Tour-
nament.

(‘alm‘.’?—Worried?‘.’

Coach Sauers frowned as he pick—
ed up the queen of spades Gary had
JllSl. dropped on him; Cohen and
Howard slept on the back seat; Don
and Eric looked over team statistics
of past games; Denny, Joe, Patsy
and Sherwin played pinochle while
Bill took in the scenery through i-llt’
tinted window. All activity was,
liowc=.'cr, superficial to the basic
question which was paramount in
the men‘s minds: "How are we go-
ing to win?"

Albany Seeded Third

The eight. teams invited to play
in the totti'ney were selected on the
basis of their Dunkel rating of
Fen-nary 23. The final results in
order of seed are:
5. Brockport
2. Cortland 6. Plattsburgh
3. Albany 7. Buffalo
4. Oneontu 8. Geneseo

According to the tournament
ri'les, preliminary contests were held
list night to separate the "mice
from the men." Yesterday's games
included Osweao vs. Bl‘OL'kpt’h‘t,
Cortland vs. Plattsburgh, Albany vs
Buffalo and Oiieontu vs. Geneseo.
The outcome of these games was,
oi course, unknown at the time of
this writing. but win or lose, each
team will play three games. The
"losers bracket" games are to be
held each afternoon and the “win-
ners bracket" games will be played
in the evening.

ing its two best eourtmen at sein—

with extremely tough opposition in
their quest for the trophy. Last

13-4 record to the Oneonta squad.

State Fair Commences At 7:15 In

The 11-8 Red Raiders will be count-
ing heavily on Joe Gauge and Tom
Murray in their race toward the
championship.
A Quick Look At The Feds

“If we can put two good halves
together, we have pretty good
chances." states the Fed mentor. It
seems that the problem of “puttini,r
two good halves together" has been
a major one during the past three
seasons. Will we meet up with this
barrier under tournament pressure?
The answer to this question is a
precious one to Coach Sauers, now
in his fourth year at the helm.

The Oswego tournament will high-
light sniscessful basketball careers

which are quickly coming to an end
fer Seniors Hoiway and Baughan.
This duo will carry much of the of-
fensive and defensive weight dur-
ing the remainder of the season.

The Starting,r Basketeers

Don Bearden, who returned to the
squad second semester, has been
gradually re g :1 i n in g that “ole
s..uthpaw touch" which gained him
the berth of second high scorer last
season.

Gary IIolway. the ace tron. Sara-
nac Lake, will pace the purple and
gold invaders in an attempt to sur-
i_ass the 403 point mark in his sea-
sonal scoring statistics.

Don Cohen Will be the third ma-
;or offensive player for the Fed
cuintet. Don, now in his Sophomore
year. boasts an astounding 86
points in the last four games.

'I‘om Bzughan will concentrate on
defense and outside shots they could
break up any tight zone seen this
itar.

l).nny Johnson, now back on the
startin; line—up. will team up with
Bii'igh..n to “mov e that ball
around.“

They Need Your Support

Our men are going to be a long
way from home for the next three
days. A familiar face in the crowd
can mean a lot in boosting the
Lam's morale.

If you care to drive out and help
cheer the team on, you will be do-
ing yourself and the team a great
favor. Remember that this is not
just an ordinary game tif 'here is
such a thing); this tournament. will
decide the State College Champion.

Why not try and come along for
a day and bring a couple of friends?

'Americans In Paris' To Open Evening

More and more people will crowd the peristyles and cafeterias, more and more

faculty members will participate, more and more money will be spent . . .

tomorrow cVening when State Fair gets unlei'way.

At 7:15 in Page Hall the curtain will rise on the opening show, “Americans in
Paris," being presented by Beta Zeta, as the 1959 State Fair begins. This money raising
campaign is sponsored as an event to raise funds to enable more foreign students to
attend State. It is one of the few events in which both students and faculty members

participate.
