Malice

To all students:

Due to the fact that “flu” of
various types—not just Asian as
we knew it last year—has been
rampant in Europe and has
started to invade this country, it
would be wise for all students
to obtain shots of polyvalent
vaccine from their own doctors.

Students who live alone or in
apartment and rooming houses
should definitely have the pro-
tection of shots since there is
no one to care for them proper-
ly when they are ill.

Students who have any under-
lying health problems, such as
old rheumatic fever or diabetes,
should also definitely obtain
shots.

Two shots. one month apart,
are required to be most effec-
tive, so these should be started
at once if they are to be of
any value this winter.

Charley And Friend Digress
On State College Miscellany

By HERB DELLO

“The world is too much with us,
Charley." I said, “or maybe it’s re—
ally against us. Charley is nice. He
never says very much. He just lis-
tens. Sometimes he even makes
shoes. Freurl was right, Charley, “I’m
hugged by clocks, too. And I'm not
even a girl. Hours, you know."

“Sure. an' badedlebeboop," said
Charley. He drove an ambulance
during World War I. Bullets that
big, and everyone a tracer.

"A tisket. a tasket," I hummed. I
suppose that I could have tried out
for "New Girl“ but I’m scared of
falling scenery. “But, Charley, does
it always have to be so still when
they die?" I asked.

"Poga skadoobiedo,” said Charley.
Sometimes he even fries slices.
Charley never kicked a. warthog.
though. Maybe I‘ll give him a stuffed
warthog [or Christmas. Man can‘t
live by bread alone, you know. The
best laid plans—how does it go,
Charley?"

“Alert iacta," said Charley, “est.”

Charley used to live in Chicago. He
was a Toddler. Lost all his friends,
though. Sold his car. Radio didn't
work any more. Never been daunt-
ed, though. Sscret of his success.
Charley just scratched his head and
called it fate.

“Dit up (loat," said Charley. He
had Japanese river fever, you know.
Caught it while fighting for Castro.
Even grew a beard. Didn’t go to Rat
Morte though. Couldn't spell back-
wards.

“How'd you like a stuffed teddy-
beur for Christmas. Charley? The
brunette in the middle with the sen—
suous carlobes. Got a cigarette?"

“Egrilch kadunkdunk." said Char-
ley. Charley is an English major. I
sign the role for him in Methods
observations all the time. Doesn‘t
know how to run a voting machine
though. Pushed all the levers down.
Coudn't open the curtain. Crawlcd
through the back of the machine.

"It's a quarter to three, Charley.
Gotta go whistle." I said.

Sleep And The World Turns

By ETAOIN snanw
Special to the Staid College Gnus, Sat., Feb. 28
Flash, hold the presses!! Inform the populace! The

Gnus has received a scoop.

Yes, some unidentified and

obviously disgruntled student has deposited one large scoop
of black rapsbui‘y-tootie-pistachio-marble-mint ice cream
on the dor step of the Gnus room. If anyone has a home
for his helpless i‘oundling he should contact this paper

immediately.

Aside from this startling development nothing im-
portant has happened around here, except that someone
stole all the school buildings early this morning.

i’rexy Says

Paul Revere Kolns, President of Staid College had this
statement to make to reporters early this morning. “Be
seriousli" Hc thcn wcnt back to sleep.

Police Are Interviewed

Charlcs H. Skinip. Commander-in-chief of the All-
banci‘ull police got to the scene of the dastardly crime
as soon as a way was cleared through the snow. This was
only eight hours after thc call was made. The college
authoi‘itics liavc cxprcsscd lll(‘ll‘ gratitude to the men who
sti'ugglcd for all this time to clear the sven blocks of one

and one hall inch snow.

Chicl' Skiinp said that obviously large well—oiled ma-
chines had been uscd to move the missing buildings. He
had no doubt that the buildings were missing. He said
that lic could tcll because there was no snow there, only
ii ncwlv painted locker room and an LB. Machine.
