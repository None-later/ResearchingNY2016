Cold Shoulder . . .

What this school needs is a good ﬁve-cent
cup of ice! As things stand now, the Stu-
dent Union does not provide sufﬁcient ice "I.
to warrant the student’s buying his ten
cent coke. Do you honestly feel, student, 
that a fair amount of ice is put in your
drink when you buy a coke? Since most
of us make the purchases simply for the 
ecstacy of chewing the ice, and since the I
coke, pepsi or what-have-you is merely the WISIIBS
sauce as it were, it follows then, does it not
that what we students want for our money you
is more ice.

Furthermore, we would also like the
additional beneﬁt of being able to purchase a
only the ice. Just as some people do not like
WhIJJBCI cream on their jello, some people
do iliclit like coke on the ice. Would it not prosperous
then be advantageous to the student as
well as the Snack Bar, to provide a large, 
that is ample, cup of pure ice for ﬁve cents?

We think it would. FAIR

We are sure that many Staid Collegers
would approve and joyfully greet such ac-
tion. We would bet that if such action were and
instigated the sale of ﬁve-cent-cups-of—ice
would be such as to warrant the continua-

tion of this policy. drISGIalms

Yes, Mister Jones, as representatives of
the student body of New York Staid College a"
for Teachers at Albany of the Staid Univer-
sit of New York, would encourage, pro- '_
moyte, and thoroughly support such a policy ResponSI
on your part. We would guarantee to buy . .
each night that the Snack Bar is open at lull"
least one cup of this five-cent-ice. t Provided

that the cups are a fair size). for
Is the student to be ignored in this case
as he so obviously is in every other? Will 

the Snack Bar offer us a five—cent—cup-of—ice,
and our whims be catered to? Or are we to
expect that the Snack Bar will again over—
ride the necessities, desires, and wants of
their customers?

Were it not against our dignity we would
kneel on the ground, head bowed, to beg,
implore, and beseech you, Mr. Jones, with
all our hearts, souls, and poised straws to
unshackle the bounds of tradition and serve
the student a ﬁve-cent-cup-of-ice.

StateHonorsSportsman
At Gary Holway Night

Tomorrow night at the RPI-State game, one of our
best known and well liked Seniors, James Gary Holway,
Will be honored. Not only is Gary married, a father of two
children, a dean’s list student, and captain of the basket-
ball team, but during his stay at State College he has been
the perfect example of the admirable attitude and gentle-
manly conduct. For all of the above and especially for his
sportsmanlike manner and athletic talent, March 7 has
been proclaimed Gary Holway Night.

During his Saranac Lake High School years, Gary was
likewise busy with distinction. He set, and still holds, the
New York State 200 yard low hurdles record. In 1949-50,
with Gary playing of course, Saranac Lake won its ﬁrst
Northern League Basketball Championship. Gary also was
a member of the basketball, football, and ski teams.
