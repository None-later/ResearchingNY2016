AMIA Action Swings Into

Double Elimination Tourney

By MIKE COYLE

This week the AMIA started their
double elimination tournament,
which is to decide this year's bas-
ketball champions. There will be a
championship t e a in representing
each of the four leagues.

In a double elimination tourney
each team may lose two games be-
fore it is eliminated. Therefore, it is
not sudden death to lose and even a
team who has lost may still win the
trophy. In this tourney the teams
that finished first and second in
the regular season play have been
awarded a bye in the first round.
In the first league, however, because
of the unequal number of teams, the
league leaders (Potter) were the
only team given this advantage.

Kapsi Downs Kappa Beta

In a very surprising show on
Monday, Bob Sischo's Kapsi team
downed a red hot KB squad. The
final score was 48-46. Just last week
KB outscored the unbeatable Potter
quintet. Leading his team to victory
in this upset, Sischo tallied 8 points

 

Beaded

Coach Sauers announces the start-
ing of baseball practice, for all in-
terested participants, on Monday,
March 9, at Page Hall from 6 to
7:30 pm. Practice will be conduct-
ed by co-captains Ray Haver and
Wes Brown. The regular scheduled
season will commence on April 18,
as the diamond squad faces the
Utica nine.

All students, with ability or de-
sire to pitch or to catch, are urged
to participate.

in each half. He received good scor-
ing support from Tom Buckley who
tallied 15.

This upset shows the stiff com-
petition that is running rampant in
the first league. With KB upsetting
Potter and the dark-horse Kapsi
downing KB. there's no telling who
will end up with the championship.

SLS Beats Sayles I

Also in the first league, SLS
dumped Sayles I, 48-38. Pete Spina
led SLS with 12 points. Tom Ellis
poured in 24 markers for the Sayies
squad.

APA downed the Old Men on
Tuesday, 48-29. Gus Tillman was
high man for APA with 15 points.

Other Results

Lei tovers 65 Transfusions 36
KoBras 40 Peepers 33
Lakers 67 Cousers 45
Sayles II 45 Sleepers 40

Those teams who are working un-
der the handicap of a loss are the
KoBras, Sayles II and two Potter
entries, the Peepers and the Sleep-
era

It seems that those teams who
were slack during the season have
tightened up for the playoffs. There
is very strong evidence to show that
spirit is high and that competition
is getting higher in all the leagues.

WAA:

ETD—UDCII Elects
Engels To Serve
As President

By R0 FENDICK

Council is in on it too! Elections
of new officers for WAA Council
took place at Wednesday's meeting.
After discussion of the merits, abil-
ities. and WAA interest of the can-
didates, votes were cast and final
decisions rendered.

Engels Selected To Serve

The newly elected officers are:
Grace Engels ‘60, President; Ellen
Gebhardt '62, Secretary; Annemarie
Sunstrand '61. Treasurer. and Ros‘ -
lie Fendick '61, Publicity Director,

Since the Constitution was modi-
fied to change the class status of
Vice-President from a Senior to a
Junior, election to this office will
take place at the next meeting. This
change was made to assure the
presence of someone to preside at
meetings in the absence of the
President who will be student
teaching first semester,

Girls Extend Thanks

Those connected with the opera-
tions of WAA wish to express thanks
and appreciation to the retiring of—
ficers for their time and interest
during the past year. They were:
President, Delores Giglio '59; Vice-
Presidcnt, Sally Weeks '59; Secre-
tary, Eicanore Silverstein ‘61; Treas-
urer, Donna Harris ’60, and Pub-
licity Director, Grace Engels,

From This Vantage Point:

School Spirit?

By JIM DOUGHER’I‘Y

Sauersmen had a record of 12-6. Sauersmen had a
Dunkel rating of 41.5. Sauersmen were seeded third.
Sauersmen beat Buffalo, Oneonta; ﬁnish third behind Cort-
land and Oswego. Sauersmen won a bid to NAIA regional
playoffs at Montclalir. Gary Holway and Don Cohen were
placed on the A11~Tournament Second Team.

How many of you are interested in the facts presented
above? How many of you had the chance to see any of the
action at Oswego? Did our team have a big sendoff? Cort—
land closed school to send oﬁ their team.

Other State Colleges Support Their Teams

One thing is dominant at this college. That is the al-
most complete lack of school spirit. Why should we be
apathetic? Why doesn’t our basketball team get more sup—

ort? I realize that it’s not all your fault. There are some
things that just aren’t provided.
Cheerleaders, Bands, Spirited Supporters

Cheerleaders represented all the tournament entries
except Albany. Bus loads of students represented all the
tournament entries except Albany. Brockport, Oswego and
Oneonta sent bands. Brockport even sent a color guard.
What did Albany send? All we sent was a team, a great
team and one that statistically was the third best repre-
sented. We also sent a coach, a manager and a reporter.
That’s all. This school wasn’t represented by another thing.
Excuse me. Our colorful school banner was sent. But, does
a school banner, nice as it may be, mean to a ﬁghting team
what a loyal crowd means?

Questions And Answers

1. Why didn‘t we send our cheerleaders? Ans. The ad—
ministration won't let our girls stray away from Albany
for any reason unless it has to do with RPI. A tournament
that means something to this school is not considered good
enough excuse for overnight permission.

2. Why weren‘t spectator buses provided? Ans. This
school doesn’t provide buses for anything except class trips
and Dippikill.

3. Why was State Fair scheduled the same weekend?
Ans. Because State Fair is for a worthy cause, as if the
tournament isn’t a cause worthy of every student's inter-
est. Our victories at Oswego gained this school more fame
than a thousand State Fairs .Let’s help ourselves before
we start helping others.

4. According to Coach Dick Sauers, “school spirit at
Albany stinks.” Why? Because there is no real central or—
ganization. Doesn’t anyone want to take the responsibility
for organizing rallies and providing means to attend away
games and important tournaments?

Cortland Next Year

Next year the invitational tournament will be held at
Cortland. Will anything be different then? If it isn't, don't
ever expect to have the tourney here in Albany. Our lack
of spirit is conspicuous to many.

I hope that some of the things presented here havv
meant something to you. I know that both Dick Stilll‘l'b'
and Gary Holway were very much hurt by the lack of in-
terest shown toward their team. Our team is even better
than the records show. They have the ability to play and
win even when no one is cheering them on. But, do you
think that this can go on forcvor‘? Even outstanding lll(‘ll
like Saucrs and Holway and the rest of the men on tho team
can get discouraged.

months of hard work, the idea became a reality. The ﬁrst
