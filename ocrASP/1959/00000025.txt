Anne Litt/efie/cl,
Faculty Wife
Writes Novel

Anne Littlefield, the wife of
Thompson H. Littlefield. Assistant
Professor of English. has written
and had published a new book, en-
titled Which Mrs. Bennet. The book,
a crime club mystery selection. has
been published by Doubleday and
Company.

Mrs. Littlefield was a faculty
member of the English department
at Russell Sage College in Troy for
six years. She attended college at
Mount Holyoke, and received her
M.A. degree from the University of
Pennsylvania. Other graduate work
has been done at the University of
Edinborough. and Radcliffe College.

Previous Publications

Anne Littlefield's short stories
have appeared in Woman's Day.
Cosmopolitan, Everywoman's, The
Colorado Quarterly, and other pop-
ular magazines However, Which
Mrs. Bennet, is her first full length
mystery.

The book has been favorably re-
viewed by the New York Times, es-
pecially for the author‘s flair for
local color dcsu‘iption. and was also
reviewed last week in the Albany
Times-Union.

A novel now in the process of-be—
ingr written by Mrs. Littiefield is a
serious work rather than a mystery.

Practical Plan:
Lighten Lunch

Shades of the Greeks! March
14 we can all eat, drink, and be
merry—with an added twentieth
century twist. Myskania joins
it. Student Senate lauds it, the
faculty acclaim it, and we all
do it. Paint the cafeteria that
is.

No more dull green walls. now
we'll have. a happy . . . All you
i ave to do is choose a section
—splash your name over it and
arrive at one o’clock Saturday
afternoon.

Elesides all painting supplies
there'll be coffee, doughnuts.
and victroia music too! The
sections should be marked off
by Wednesday. Cans of paint
will be by the vending machines.

Just dip and presto — you've
reserved your section.

The era of do-it-yourself has
finally hit State College as the
students march to the cafeteria
—paint brushes in hand to
brighten the dull old walls of
Husted. Smoke and grease will
give way to the charm of fresh
paint.

Ed. Note:

This column is open to all State
College faculty and students for dis-
cussion of any subject which the
writer considers an "aifalr” of State
College. All such articles should be
in the student mailbox of David
Feldman by Tuesday afternoons.

Year after year the lofty few who
deem themselves participants ele-
vate themselves to the top of the
nearest soap-box and in very right-
eous voices denounce the lack of in-
terest shown by their fellow stu-
dents iii school activities. They label
these non—participants with the
most despicable titles possible and
generally create more antagonism
than existed before.

A feeling of sympathy went out
to the poor candidate for the Sen-
ate who thought that all problems
would cease to exist if one bulletin
board would be moved. Final count
showed that be retained twenty-five
friends. His mistake was basic. In
order to have participating students
have to have interested stu-

dents, and the sad state of affairs is
that we have the wrong type of per-
sonnel to facilitate student interest.

Here are the sad facts. Approxim-
ately twenty-five percent of the
student body are commuters and
another ten percent are vets. Add
to this another twenty percent made
up of part-time workers and you
have less than half the school left
of people who care about something
more than their education.

In addition, you have the usual
percentage of gripers, pessiinists
who wouldn’t care if the school
turned down. Sum it all up and the
remaining total represents the
amount of people who are partici-
pating in student affairs.

To these people I say. stop aim—
ing so high and be more practical.
Work with what you have and ac-
cept the fact that these other peo-
ple have more important things to
do than daily with college activities.
And above all, stop preaching about
the apathy of the students. It gets
sickening after a while.

Fair Award
Goes To SLS

Due to a financial error during the
Fair, Alden Hall, as previously an-
nounced, was not Fair winner. Sig-
ma Lambda Sigma with its Soaka-
thon came in first place with $56.65;
Phi Delta with its Horror Show
came in second with $48.56. Both
represented concessions. Chi Sigma
Theta. with a variety show won first
place with $68. The total of all con-
cessions was $1,099.41.

1960

Next year the faculty will present
the opening show instead of the
organization coming in first place.
Every school generation the faculty
takes over for the opening enter-
tainment for the Fair.

Booster selling for the Fair showed
a lack of enthusiasm on the part of
the student. Sales were below last
year's record.
iiicliange Student

Agnes Goransson '61. our exchange
student from Sweden, drew the.
winning name in the M&M con-
test. Miss Goransson also was at
t .e Fair answering questions about
lll‘l' country and her life at State.
