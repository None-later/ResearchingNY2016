Consider the misfit. He is in no
fraternity or club, on no team and
holds no student oﬁice. He pads
through the halls, unseen by him-
self or others. He sits in the lounge
alone or maybe with another mis-
fit with whom he'll speak about
classes and teachers or one of the
few things he knows. He wants to
be taken for what he considers the
average type college student—the
one with the girls, the jokes, the
friends, the one invited to all the
parties. He is not very talkative or
else he's too talkative. His clothes
are not quite in style. He's sort of

ugly. Most of the misfits know
where they stand in college life;
the lucky ones don’t.

A warning to the popular student
—never befriend a. misfit. You'll
never get him off your neck. Give
a. misfit a smile or a couple of min-
utes conversation and you’ll be his
buddy for life. You‘ll never get rid
of him. Wherever you are he'll be
some place around you, because he
wants everyone to see what an lin-
portant friend he has. It’s only be-
cause he's proud of you and maybe
just a flattering bit jealous. but it
can be an awful pain in the neck.
Getting rid of him is easy if you
don‘t mind kicking kids and puppy
dogs.

He is not sure what he wants. but
he knows he doesn't have it. There's
some gap that separates him from
what he‘d like to be. Maybe it's
talent. Maybe it’s confidence or per—
sonality or something there is no
word for. I don't think anyone
knows. I think he makes up more
than half of the students of any
college or the people in any world.

What the misfits here at State
should do is unite but unity takes
leaders and no true misfit is a lead-
er. It's all very unfortunate and I
wish some one would make a slig—
gcstion.

Survey Reveals Professor Discusses Possible
Organization of Drill Team

By DONALD LIEDEL, Associate Professor of History

Facts, Figures
On Education

Today it is estimated that about
2 million children are being deprived
of an adequate education. It can
be said that all of these children
are underprivileged in the sense
that they are not receiving the
proper facilities which lead to suit~
able education.

Why is this true? The public
schools of America need 140,500 ad-
ditional classrooms to accommodate
1,843,000 pupils enrolled in excess of
normal capacity.

Enrollment Increase

"Survey findings showed that en-
rollment in the public schools iii-
creased 1,148,000 over the previous
year." According to the report from
Washington and the "Outlook on
Education“ an increase of 3.5 per
cent enrollment took place from
1958 to 1959.

This cvcr liltl't’tlhlllg pupil enroll-
ment is not being met, however, by
the construction of new classrooms.
in 1958 the number of classrooms
scheduled for completion was 71,600
compared to the actual number of
rooms completed in 1957 which was
70,500; 1,100 fewer than actually
cstimuted for the 1957-58 year.

Proposals To Provide
F or Construction

Arthur S Flemming, Secretary of
Health, Education, and Welfare, in-
itiated two proposals designed to
strengthen American education.

One proposal would facilitate the
construction of public elementary
and secondary schools during the
next five years. An appropriation of
$3 billion would be set aside for this
purpose. This Would allow the con-
struction for approximately 75,000
new classrooms and another five
year program would provide for ap-
proximately $2 billion for facilities
lil institutions of higher learning.

State College has had a fascin-
ating history since its founding. Stu-
dents and graduates from State have
fought in every major war from
the Civil War to the Korean War.
There is a group of students and
faculty on campus today that feels
that this history should not be con-
fined to history books. There should
be an organization to keep this his-
tory alive and before the eyes of
the public.

“Normal School Company"

The orstanizaiion that could keep
this history alhe would be a drill
team, organized along the line of
the original company of students
and faculty that fought in the Civil
War. The team would wear uniforms
as close to the oriuinai uniforms as
possible, and curry and drill with
the weapons of the period.

The group during the Civil War
was the 44th Regiment of the New
York State Volunteer Infantry,
Company  This company. known
as the “Normal School Company,”

was organized on the State Collm.
(then called the Normal S'liinli
campus by Rodney G. Kimball .Ulil
Albert N. Husted, Professors
IVIaticinutics. The company iii
formed participated in many of '3»-
major battles of the Civil War 
eluding,r Fredericksburg. Chauccll -;
ville, Gettysburg, Wilderness .n -
Petersburg.

At. Least [7 Men Needed

happy to point the others out to
you.

Mr. Gcbhart, In “AFFAIRS AT
STATE." must have access to news
which no one else hears of. He was
able to report that one of the male
candidates for senate receive sup-
port from only 25 voters. Those
who only have the lists published
o Inauguration Day, will fliid the
not one male candidate received 25
votes. Also. no candidate received
26 votes. I say 20 votes as Mr. Geh—
hart may have known that the un—
fortunate candidaie voted for him-
self.

Of course I must not forget to
praise him for his knowledge of
what he was talking about. Perhaps
