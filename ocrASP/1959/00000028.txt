Tournament Reaches Final
Round Of Basketball Play

This week’s AMIA basketball action has brought the
tournament to the ﬁnal round of action. Nine games were
played this week. The results offer a good indication of
who the winners in each league will be.

APA Versus Potter

The most important game this week featured a contest
in the ﬁrst league between APA and Potter. The men from
State Street came out on top, 44-41. High man was Thomp-
son with 13 points. Following him, was Haver with 10.
For the South Lake men Tillman led on with 11 points.
Both teams were undefeated to this point.

The other game in the ﬁrst league was held between
Sayles I and the Old Men. Sayies came out on top, 31-20.
From the results of the past two weeks, it looks as if Potter,
the winners of the regular season, intend to add an encore
and cop tournament honors. Other teams to watch are APA
and SLS, but do not overlook anyone. With the surprising
results that have been turned in, anything can happen.

In the second league, the Leftovers for-
feited to the Lakers and the Goobers topped
EEP, 34-28. High man for the Goobers was

Bisson, featuring 15 points. Recesso had 13 Holway‘ Gary

Junior Varsity Ends Season
With Fourteen Win Total

. I Although this group has not received its deserved pub-
hoity, due to lack of space and time, the Junior edition of
the basketball squad has ended its most successful season
in the past six years with a 14-7 record. Coached by gradu-
ate Ron Graves, the JV’s boasted promising material for
next year’s varsity squad.

Trio to Varsity

Three men already moved up to the Sauers’ squad are
Paul Howard, Pat Spicci and John Wallace . Other featured
prospects are Casey, Green, Maus, Horowitz, and Western.
It Is rare to ﬁnd in a junior team such a combination of ac-
curate shooters as was present this past season. Roger Ca-
sey, possessing a deadly jump shot, amassed a 12.2 average
in thirteen games. A look at the defense showed that Dick
Horowitz was top hustler with two very quick hands. Hank
Maus and Lynn Western totaled a 8.7 and 5.7 average re-
spectively. Jim Green often took hoop honors with quick
drives and an accurate one hand shot. Mert Southerland
showed considerable improvement toward
the end of the season on offense as well as.
on defense. John Wallace and Pat Spicci
continued to start in the junior bracket,
although they were now part of the Sauers’

Sauersmen End

Glorious Season
By JIM IHH'GIIICRTY

A (31-53 triumph over RPI brought down the curtain
on another glorious basketball season for the varsity Peds.
During the past winter, the Sauersmen compiled a record
of seventeen wins against only eight defeats. A breakdown
of this record will reveal several interesting facts.

Who Says We Can‘t Win on a Large Court?

There seem to be some pcople who think that State
can’t win anywhere but on their home court. To defy
the “experts,” the Sauersmen won ten
games on the road; all of them were on
largemaximum size courts. The other sev-
cn wins were garnered in Page‘s close-
closct gymnasium.

As the ﬁnale of a Broadway show, the closing cur
tain descended last Saturday on the ﬁnal performance of a
successful Ped basketball season. On this honored evening,
Gary Hoiway Night, the Sauersmen downed the Cherry
and White Engineers, 61-53. Returning from their NAIA
venture, the quintet trodded the Page Hardwood in what
might be called a weakened physical condition. The ham-
pering effect of fatigur did not, however, detain the squad
from obtaining a starting and lasting margin. Gary dis-
played his usual accuracy, scoring ﬁve points in the ﬁrst
thirty seconds of the fray. At the twenty minute buzzer,
locals were ahead, 29-23; intermission featured the honor-
ing of State’s most valuable player in its many years of
hoop play, Senior Gary Hoiway from Saranac Lake. At-
tendance was at its highest, as the modest captain received
due honors, amidst the cheers of the crowd, the team, the
coach, the cheerleaders, and his two little daughters. At
the start of the second half, RPI closed in, giving the Al-
banians a three-point margin. Hoiway brought his season’s
