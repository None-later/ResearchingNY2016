C /ub Members
Invite Interest,
Participation

It has come to the attention of
the members of Outing Club that
the students of this college do not
realize completely some of the rights
for which they pay.

The Outing Club, for instance, is
open to any student to join at any
time. As it now stands, a member
is anyone who has been on at least
three activities. This includes trips
to Dippikill. skiing trips, bicycle
trips, etc. To be able to attend an
nativity. one must be a student at
State College, and must be repre-
sented at the meeting of the club
prior to that particular activity.

There are remlar meetings of the
club scheduled bi-inonthly on
Thursday evenings at 7:30 pm. in
Brubachcr Hall. The next meeting
will be Thursday evening.

If a trip comes between weeks, a

special meeting is held as posted on

the Outingr Club bulletin board in
Lower Draper.

Dawn Dance

To Feature
Zach in Bru

The eyes have it! Grab your No-
Doze and follow the crowd of blurry-
eyed students to Bru's dining room
and those blood-shot eyes won't be
a dream. It's Student Union Board's
annual Dawn Dance. This year‘s
theme is "The Morning After"——the
title beingr appropriate at 5 a.m. in
the morning.

Zach Clements and his band will
play for the dance and they too
will be dressed accordingly. The
dining room will be decorated with
colors apropm to the early hours
and theme. What with Hell Nights,
pajama parties, and all night get-
togethers, the facial expressions
should blend very well with the title
of the dance.

Come As You Are

Uniqueness of the dance is its
main drawing power. So for this
dance students may wear anything
their hearts desire—-bermudas, pa-
jtllllilS, and anything else.

Refreshments Served

At 6 an]. coffee and doughnuts
will be served and the surprise door
prize awarded.

Since this dance is for State Col-
lege students only, ID. cards will be
checked at the door. Each person is
allowed to bring one guest on his
card.

No men will be allowed in the
building before 5 am. and everyone
must enter the front door of Bru.

(‘ommittees

The various committees and their
chairmen are: Decorations, Janice
Graham '60 and Robert Harris ’61;
Publicity, Shirley Stewart '60; Band,
Jay Hulbert '61; Refreshments, Re-
nate S.:oenfelder '60; Arrangements,
Judy Pearlstcne '60; and Chapter-
ones, Marsia Ronspees ‘61.

s'iewiez '61, Secretary; Janet Rie-
g‘le ‘60. 'i‘rezisurer.

Miss Russell also announced
the need for new members. This
pertains mostly to the under-
classmen, but upperclassmen are
also welcomed.

Four hours of credit will be given
for the course, which is being tuughi
into in the day to enable ni'cti teach—
vi's’ to take it. :dong with students

Intermediate

'lhc Department expects to offer
both Elementary and Intermediate
Russian during the academic year
1900-61, in order that students can
fulfill their language requirement
in Rlls‘Slilll.

Students intending to do this will
take Elementary Russian this fall
and Inteunediate a year later.

Two Years

At this time it is still uncertain

whether or not the course in Rus-

sian wil be offered beyond the sec-
ond year, according to Dr. Cliilders.
