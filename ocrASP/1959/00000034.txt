From This Vantage Point:

Cold . . . Crisp-

Badminton . . . Fix
By JIM DOUGHERTY

Assurance having been received, the Sauersmen will
open their diamond campaign at Bleecker Stadium. Hav-
ing managed to win only one game a year at Bleecker
(each against Plattsburgh) in the past three seasons,
Coach Sauers hopes to break the jinx in the opener with
Utica providing the opposition. In preparation for the
opener, Sauei‘s has scheduled intei'squad contests for to-
morrow morning and again on Sunday afternoon.

Last week in an independent basketball game, Bill
Thompson suffered a broken ankle. Although Sauei's is
optimistic about Bill‘s return to varsity athletics, Bill feels
quite differently. He says, “I've had the course. This is
the ﬁfth time that I have broken the same ankle and I
feel that it is about time I retired for good.“

Gary llolway‘s name also pops up on the independent
basketball scene. Gary was named the Most Valuable
Player in this year‘s LaSalle Basketball Tournament.

Dick Sauch and Merlin Hathaway are being con-
sidered odds-0n favorites to cop ﬁrst place in the doubles
competition of the up-coming AMIA badminton tourna-
ment. Sauei's appears to have the edge for the singles
title. (This information was supplied by Dick Sauei‘s.)

The only comment from this vantage point is whether
these two men are qualiﬁed members of the AMIA.

Dave Pause turned in an outstanding performances
in the recent AAU wrestling tournament. Dave walked
off with ﬁrst place honors in the 137 pound class. A bye
into the semi-ﬁnals and a pin in his ﬁrst match set the
stage for a hard-fought 5-2 decision against Lafayette’s
Dalton Marks in the ﬁnals. t seems all Dave needs is a
little inspiration, both on the mats and in the stands.

Refrigerated Fi‘Liit~O-Matic. Guess who's idea that
was. Get out your little bag of dimes and go down to the
Union and get yourself a chilled fruit. Yes, that's right,
everyone who frequents the Union is bound to become a
much more healthy person. Maybe a few apples will make
some of the people in this school feel that they are health-
ful enough to participate in athletics. Remember the
swingin‘est affair around is National Fruit for Health Week.

Dave Pause Cops Honors In AAU
Tournament; Hill Loses Decision

By DAVE MILLER

'Albany took the spotlight in the State-
Wide wrestling scene during the last week-
end before Easter vacation by acting as host
to the AAU regional wrestling tournament,
scene of some of the best wrestling in the
area, and put on a good show with a highly
successful tournament and a ﬁrst place
ﬁnish by Dave Pause, a Schenectady boy
who wrestled for Mont Pleasant High

School. and a pair of second place
ﬁnishes.

Pause Wins Top Honors

There was also a fourth place
winner to add to State laurels in
this ﬁrst of what may become an
annual regional tourney for high
szhool, college, and indepei'ident
grapplers. For Dave Pause. this was
a great win after a mediocre season
in which he went up a weight class
and won only 11 points while losing
15. He wrestled some of the best
wrestling in his career in this
tournament, however, and came on
In ﬁne style to show his ability and
win the Sectionals by beating Dalton
Marks in a close ﬁnal.

In his freshman year the Ped
sophomore, destined to be second
highest Scorer on the team in gain-
ing thirty-four points while losing
only six. lost only two matches
wrestling as a 130 pounder. But this
tournament proved what a lot of
people thought—that Dave Pause
can be a great wrestler in any class.
Hill Cops Second

In other action, Joe Hill narrowly
missed winning a championship
himself when he loss a close de-
cision to Larry Nealon of Syracuse
in the finals. The Fed senior.
wrestling his second tourney in a
week, put on a typically brilliant
performance, mid lost out only by
a hair on the championship.

Don Warne, a co-captuln who has
just completed his ﬁrst ftill season
of wrestling. had to come up with
some tremendous grappling to beat
out Bill Hodson of Paul Smith in
the consolation round to take an
eventual fourth place. He lost in
the finals of the consolation.

Coach Joe Garcia had praise for
the great job (lone by the student
help and oilicials.
