SUBstitution . . .

Something new will be in operation this year: Social
Calendar will be handled by Student Union Board. We
think it’s a great idea! It looks like a solution may ﬁnally
be here for a big source of complaint. The calendar
will operate on a month to month basis except for major
events. This should eliminate some of the bickering and
forgetting that goes with Social Calendar.

In case you’re in doubt about about the Board’s pre-
paredness, check the story on the front page. This setup
plus the Board’s investigation into other college calendars
have convinced us that they can do it better. We’re glad
to see that a group on campus has ﬁnally done something
constructive toward clearing up a tedious situation and
is willing to take on a ticklish job. With full cooperation
from everybody, we should have a better Social Calendar
and a happier student body this year. EAS

It's a Secret. . .

Yesterday and today the student body has been, and
is, voting on the amendments to the SA Constitution. You
didn’t know that? We’re not going to scream at you; we
didn’t either.

Has Senate become the secret organization on cam-
pus? For years we’ve been misinformed; we thought it
was Myskania. With thirty Senators can’t someone put
up a poster? Maybe you need a publicity director to do
your job of getting information back to the student body.
There have been aides added to government before.

The amendments which are being voted on are the
deletion of the 2.5 average clause as a qualiﬁcation for
president and vice president of SA, and Myskania being
given the organization of the freshman class.

We’ve voiced our opinions on these before but to re-
iterate—why should qualiﬁed candidates be eliminated for
academic reasons; isn’t interest in and knowledge of gov—
ernment more important to efﬁcient government than a
2.5; won’t 13 people who serve as a forcible check on each
other, and who are non partisan, be able to do a better
job than two?

In short, pass the amendments!

with us on the Oscar winners. We
guarantee you fans that if Holly-
wood ever trles to pull a trick like
that again they will hear from us
personally. And you people wonder
why we knock the movies.

Due to the tremendous enthusiasm
shown us by our deserving followers

The Facade

By DAVE FELDMAN

Why does everyone get so excited
about Spring? Big deal—Spring.

The ground gets all wet and soggy
and you sink up to your ankles in
the muck. The roads get all rutted
and ruin your car. There is no more
nice camouflage of snow to hide ugly
old Albany. Wiio needs Spring?
Big Myth

Who slartcd this big tiiytli about
Spring? This puppy—love. flowers-
in—blooin. all pervading happiness

Forms Due
For Housing

Any student that. has not filled
out a housing form for the fall must
do so immediately. unless the stu-
dent has indicated the desire to live
in a fraternity or sorority house
and has had his name filed with
those lists.

The thought of gullibleness brings
to mind Bermuda shorts. I have nev—
er seen a man without knobby knees
and hairy shins. Those who wear
those long socks just accent their
horrible male knees. I have never
met a female with good looking legs
who wore Bermudas. If they have
nicely fonned legs they show them.
If not they try to hide them with
these stovcpipe shaped shorts—and
ncvcr succeed.

And Love and Baseball

In the Spring .it is said. a young
man turns to love—of baseball. One
is worse than the other. You must
cithcr spend all your money on some
chick who probably would never be
worth it or you exhaust yourself
chasing some ridiculous leather-
covercd pill around a wet field.

Spring also ushers in a plague of
l pen convertibles filled with scream-
111.: juvenile delinquents hoping to
prove that they are better than
someone else because the car they
are in is brightci or longer or more
filled than any other.

We always look at the good points
of this flu-filled season. These over-
looked bad qualities should be
brought to our collective attention.
Happy. Happy Spring

Why does no one ever consider
such things as skunk cabbage. hay-
fever. colds. poison ivy. the flu.
n isy birds. bumptious juveniles, in-
sects. or sunburn? We have all been
propagandiacd into believing that
this. the most cunning. vicious and
undcrhaiided of seasons is a time of
natural delights and freedom from
earthly cares.

What can we do to combat this?
We should fight. with all we can.
We should reveal what we know and
then we will spread the truth to
those less fortunate than ourselves.
We should not close our eyes and
wish on the first robin—he is prob-

ably last year‘s leftover.
