under-achieving in college; pupils
of average aptitude were under-
achieving in high school and in col-
lege; high staff turnover which was
not related to salary.

The report was recently an article
in the New York Times which was
headlined by "Scarsdale Finds

Report Says Graduates Fall Short
of Expectations at College." The
problems and issues raised by this
report are to be discussed.

14W 6} Side

By ROBERT GEBHARDT

__

Albany State follows very closely
to the city of Albany in many re-
spects, but the closest resemblance
is seen when you come to the topic
of culture. On this particular sub-
;ect you can sum up Albany's par-
ticipation in one word, nothing.
And the sad part is that State is
not far behind. We have feeble at-
tempts su:h as the Music Council
presentations and D&A but these
fall far short of the standard that
should be set.

In the music field we IlllVi‘ tout-
side of offered coursesl Music Coun-
cil, which strives rcry diligently to
bring our school some fine cnter-
taininent. but they are stymied by
lack of funds. We have listening
rooms where a person may go to
hear good music, but these are usu-
ally filled during the week with
music students and are not open
on weekends. Maybe a record ex-
change club could be started to fill
this gap.

In philosophy our school is at
the lowest ebb of any college I
have seen or heard of. Our student
body either does not think about
the ideological basis of life or if
they do. they are very inarticulate
about it. There is relatively little
discussion of religion. or the indivi-
dual's goals in life, The entire camp-
us seems to be shrouded with the
mutual agreement that one will not
talk about his goals or religion if
the other won‘t.

People refuse to discuss the logi—
cal aspects of their respective reli-
gions for lcar of losing any existing
beliefs that they have.

Discussion of any kind seems to
I)l‘ purely surface conversation in-
tciided to do nothing. more than
waste time. The school adds to this
dilemma completely by lay—passing
the inclusion of required philosophy
{'(lLll'Si‘\ for the undergraduate, es-

no pliilos phy clubs or anything
that comes close to this type of
organization.

For a school that ls preparing peo-
ple to influence the lives of the
younger gtneration. State docs not
give its students the background to
enable them to assume a position of
molders of Amciican youth.
