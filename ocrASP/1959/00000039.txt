Don't Apologize . . .

It was brought to our attention this week that too
many State College students have a very negative attitude
toward this institution. We are all willing to sit back and
criticize the food in Brubacher. what Senate does, or a
cold classroom. Our intentions are the best: by criticizing
we will stimulate people into improvement.

Because of our negative impression we apologize for
the school. It isn’t necessary. There is no reason why you
or I should apologize to our friends from Cornell or Michi-
gan because we go to “State Teachers.” For once let‘s try
to recognize the value of this school.

Begin by reading this week’s “Affairs of State." then
look over what Louis Jones had to say about the college
in his book (page 3). Think for a moment of what you
will have been exposed to by the time you graduate—an
outstanding faculty, a stimulating education.

Try to re-evaluate your feeling about the school from
an academic point of vieW——-and remember why you’re in
college. You are among educated and challenging minds.
in a place where individuality is welcomed: a university.
Among universities this is one of the best, but few of us
realize that the opportunity we now have is rare.

When we join the ranks of “educated men and women"
we will be representatives of a good college. We will have
had the advantage of an education from a variety of
trained and stimulating minds in an institution of high
academic standards.

You won’t just graduate from Albany State. you will
graduate from an excellent education center.

L&C...

They said it couldn‘t be done! State College made
history this week—it got out an exam schedule four weeks
before ﬁnals! This no doubt is the first, and we hope. not
the last. time such a phenomenal occurrence has taken
p ace.

E.A.S.

For the members of the student body who are not
acquainted with the process of making out a schedule, we
pass on the following information. It is the common belief
of the higher dignitaries of this institution that it is im-
possible to work out a schedule before the time when
courses can be dropped has ended. or after eight weeks of
the semester have passed. The reasoning behind this is
that many of the “phantom conflicts” will not appear in
the schedule and it will be easier to make up.

Several times the schedule has been worked out by
IBM machines; but alas, man is not indispensable; the
machines can‘t do the job too well. This year the schedule
was concocted by two of the professors here at State. who
spent all of Easter vacation and many evenings after the
vacation working out this gem. Guess the student body
can give them an A for the course. they even turned in
the term project early.

On behalf of the student body. we feel we owe a vote
of appreciation to Dr. Carrino and Dr. liuippold for this
masterpiece.

PS. Next weck there will be a lctter to the editors
correcting the spelling of the above names by the concerned
parties.

OK. so Victor Hugo didn't write

fact is that it was three days be-

and then by one of the jaiiitors.
Anyway. you didn't see the movie.
