From This Vantage Point:
Iron-Armed
Hurlers . . .

By JIM DOUGIIERTY

Spring is deﬁnitely with us now. With it comes in-
creased athletic activity here on campus. The two sports
that attract the most attention are, of course, baseball
and softball. No matter what the caliber of personnel these
teams may possess, the center of interest lies on the
mound. Everyone has his opinion about pitchers, but
here is a poem concerning this, the toughest of“ all places
to be on the diamond.

A SONG 0F IRON-ARMED HURLERS
How dear to my heart was the old-fashioned hurler

Who labored all day on the old village green.
He did not resemble the up-to-date twirler

Who pitches four innings and ducks from the scene.
The up-to-date twirler I’m not very strong for;

He has a queer habit of pulling up lame.

And that is the reason I banker and long for
The pitcher who started and finished the game.
The old-fashioned pitcher
The iron-armed pitcher,
The stout-hearted pitcher

League Games; Kobras Beat Rousers

By DAN LABEILLE

The Pogos. last year's defending
champions. got off on the right foot
with a 7-4 victory over APA in
Tuesday‘s inaugural game. Jack
Oimsbee took the mound chores for
the Okeefenokee swampinen as the
South Lake men went to bat in the
top of the first. The side was quick-
ly retired as Don Donato hit into a
double play. Tony Amelio. on the
hill for the blue and white, faced
three Pogomen and the inning
quickly ended.

In the top of the second Keith
Kempton hit .i home run to right

the third Hank Boehning scored on
a short single. Bottom of the third

The story of the Union double

a dotible in a pinch hit role and a
triple as a regular in the second
game.

This display of hitting strength,
coupled with a three-for-four per-
formance of Spina and the big bat
of Dick Lewis, gives the Feds a
scoring punch that makes any point
in the batting order strike fear into
the opposing pitchers. Haver's sec-
ond game blast drove in two runs
and Gilchrist powered three across
the plate with his swat in the first
game.

Jim Brown. a freshman from
Hudson Falls. got both of his extra
base knocks with the sacks empty.

The Feds struck early and often
in the Uti:a game. scoring the first
run in the first inning on a single
by Lewis who batted in Gilchrist.
’Ihey tallied once in the second, and
exploded for foui runs in the fifth
on singles by Gilchrist. Salernos,
Haver. Lewis. and Dzikowicz and a
pair of sacrifice; by Connie Schmidt
and Pete Spina.
