Help Wanted . . .

This newspaper was started in 1916. It is one of the
oldest student run organizations on campus and can be
proud of its policy involving no faculty advisor. However,
like every other organization on campus, it has its ups and
downs. We’re not referring to quality of writing (you all
comment quite freely on that), we’re referring to the num--
ber of interested participants. There are eight members
of News Board; one graduates in June; six retire from of-
ﬁce next January; one member remains to carry on. As
for staff, we have two Sophomores and ﬁve freshmen that
come in whenever they have nothing better or more press-
ing to do.

Problem: Who will know enough to carry on next
year? The newspaper business isn’t learned in one week.
It takes practice in its many phases for incoming editors
to be able to put out a paper. What we‘re saying is—any
student willing to contribute about six hours a week to
some activity should drop in the ofﬁce.

This isn't meant to be taken ﬂippantly, we're very
serious about the existing state of affairs. As of now, there
is no one in line for editorship next January. There will
be a great deal of material for an interested party to di-
gest between now and January, but the paper has its
rewards.

It seems to us that the paper makes a pretty big con-
tribution to the activities here at State. It would be a
shame to see it disbanded because of the lack of interested
participants. Maybe the student body should start reading
bulletin boards, they will be the remaining communication
system if more interest isn’t taken in the paper.

Not to seem all alone in this problem—the Pedagogue
staff is as nonexistent as ours; last time we checked Press
Bureau had a budget, no members, just a budget; shall
we continue? . . . Don‘t the students of this college have
any interests besides bridge, drinking, and making fun of
the kids that are active in school activities?

M.T.

Say Cheese . . .

Typical of groups suffering from lack of active par-
ticipants is the State College Photo Service. The Service
has operated for two years, taking pictures for the News,
the Pedagogue and the Handbook. It will be disbanded in
June because it lacks its basic ingredient: people.

We’d like to let those of you who’ve had no contact
with the Photo Service know just how hard and well the
three members have worked in these two years. Dick Sum-
ner, Don Bindrim and recently Paul Weaver have been at
the beck and call of publications’ editorsnthey have taken
and developed pictures, kept secrets, argued and generally
taken care of a long hard job.

We‘ve heard rumors that “there’s graft in the Photo
Servtce"; there isn’t. Work has been done on such a tight
schedule and budget that the pl‘iotogi‘aphers haven’t had
time to think about profit. With the staffs of the other
campus publications, we‘d like to express our appreciation
to the State College Photo Service, another unsupported
unrewardecl activity, ‘

'!‘0 the Editors:

I'd like to tilkf‘ this opportunity
to thank the members of otir fac-
ulty and student body who worked
on the New York State High School
Forensic Finals last, weekend. Your
valuable tilnc and energy were
greatly appreciated and helped to
make the event so successful.

Oil behalf of Mr. Prichiird tillfi
myself. our sincere thanks for Ii job
well done.

Sincerely.
.Ioiin Yilger ‘59
Chairman

To the Editors:

The reading of last week.» News
was indeed a unique experience. For
the first time within this college
gt‘neratione and undoubtedly even
longer ~tIlt‘i'l.‘ existed a concentrated
eil'ori at presenting to the student
body an encouraging pi lure of Stati-
College‘s actual and potential posi-
tioii in the academic world.

Almost every one of us. ill one
t.nic or another. Iiil> been subject ~1
to the CUIIdt‘SCt‘lldillL’, attitude held
by so many people outside the col-
lege community. With the student
body, this feeling is manifested ll
negzitivkm and ignorance

The cause of this lack of confl-
dcncc ciin bi- attributed to two ille—
tors: l. A failure to develop our own
rtsoilrces: 2. A failure to develop
ptiblic relations It is commonly rc-
cogiiithi by most ituiiiiiiist-i'iiiioils
that these [\l'o areas are of the
greatest importance in building .i
college reputation.

The solution M‘i‘lils to lie 111 such
advances (in the Faculty Lecture-

National Defense Student Loan Program
Grants Financial Aid to Students at State

Applications will now be consid-
ered for loans provided by the Na-
tional Defense Student Loan pro—
gram, as the College is now in a
position to accept these requests.
The application forms may be so-
cured in the Student Personnel of—
fice. but will only be considered to
help with expenses oi the current
semester.

Nine-tenths 0f the money to be
lit.illt‘(i will be federal money. and
one-tenth college money. as stated
in the National Defense Act. For

Albany State students, the money
is provided through the State. Uni-
versity.

The College has the responsibility
for deciding who shall receive loans,
and the amount of each loan. Loans
are to be made only to full-time
College students who are in good
standing and who are “in need of
the amount of the loan to pursue a
course of study."

According to the Act. the loans
to any :tuden’ may not be more
than $1,000 in clit.‘ year nor $5.000

over-ail. Repayments are made in
installments over a ten-year period
beginning one year after the student
completes or drops his studies in
higher education. While the loan is
being repaid, interest at the rate
of‘ three percent will be charged.

The National Defense Act pro-
vides for cancellation of ten percent
of ii borrower's note. and interest.
every year for five years if he
serves as a full-time teacher in a
public chmentary or secondary
school.
