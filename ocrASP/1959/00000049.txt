Since this is the last issue of
the STATE COLLEGE NEWS
for the school year, students are
asked to be especially careful to
watch SIS, Student Mail Boxes,
and the official notices placed on
the bulletin boards.

This notice applies especially
to such things as changes in the
exam schedules and student
teaching meetings.

By KEVIN

Here at State there seems to be
an attitude of treating religion con-
descendingly, as though it were he-
neath serious consideration by col-
lege students. (Please don't disagree
with me yet.) I have gotten this
impression from teachers as well as
from students. In class some of my
instructors have implied that reli-
gions are merely artifices which
precious, less sophisticated genera-
tions have devised as an explanation
for or protection against mysteries
which they were not equipped to ex-
plore. I have heard many students
say things like, “Well, my parents
still go to Church and all, but 
and then go on to imply that they
have out-grown that stage. Religious
jokes, take-offs on the sick jokes, are
also common here. They can be
heard in bars and fraternities and,
if anything, they seem to mask an
insecurity on the part of those who
tell them and those who laugh.

Of course, many students here

belong to the religious organizations
which participate, on a college-wide
basis, in the activities of their vari-
ous faiths. There is even a tradi-
tional state College Sunday here
although I suspect that many of us
have never heard of it, much less
taken part in it.

“We are the molders of our na-
tion's future,” may be a cliche here,
but, like many cliches, it is true. If
we who are to wield such influence
over young minds do not want to
follow a religion, at least we should
not mock it. It is too personal and
important a subject to be treated
lightly before impressionable minds.

It might help if there were to be
a council of all the religious groups
in school to sponsor some sort of
intor-denominational activities in
which the whole student body could
participate.

The impressions I have received
may reflect only a small minority
but it shouldn't exist at all.
