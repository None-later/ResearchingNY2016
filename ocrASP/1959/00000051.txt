Hey Frosh, Soph . . .

Now is the time for all good Sophs and Fresh to come
to the aid of their classes. Rivalry is descending upon us
once again. The time of purple beanies, sweatshirts (green
and otherwise), muddy shoes, banners, cheers and more
sweatshirts.

Idealistically, rivalry is set up so that two classes in
particular may get acquainted with each other as class-
mates and colleagues. it seems to us that this ideal is not
as far fetched as some we will encounter at times during
our life and that we should try and live up to it.

This in translation means—go out and support rivalry.
It is set up for reasons which may seem obscure at times,
especially when you can sleep on Saturday morning, but
it has its merits. You’re put in a Situation where you are
working with people having similar interests and abilities
to your own. You're enlarging your number of friends.
You‘re having fun. Finally, how else can you get a cold and
sore throat in two hours? M.T.

SUNY & SUCEA . ..

This fall we are made doubly aware that we‘re return—
ing to a university rather than simply to a college, by the
fact of a new name. The State University College of Edu-
cation at Albany is still the same old Albany State, but
with a shiny new title.

The change in teachers‘ colleges’ names is quite ap-
propriately timed, since it coincided with the announce-
ment of a new president for SUNY. Perhaps we are assum-
ing too much, but we feel there are conclusions to be
drawn from these reports.

First of all, the State University is asserting itself as
a university. It should assume a prominence and be a more
dominating ﬁgure among the colleges, rather than being
an afterthought. It might even reach the stage where the
student answers “I go to State U. at Albany,“ not State
College or Albany State.

The University is only eleven years old, and firm estab-
lishment is a difficult process. You can't reach Harvard
status in a decade. An entire year without a president is
no help in strengthening a university‘s position. We sin—
cerely hope that what looks like the beginning of a renewed
University can become a unified, sound institution with
purposeful functions and the means to accomplish some-
thing concrete.

To our way of thinking, well aimed direction is the
most effective way it can be done. We regret that we could
not have heard more of Dr. Hamilton's own evaluation of
SUNY‘s position in his Wednesday talk, but we wish him
success with the State University. EAS.

A Little Consideration . . .

In the past we have kindly asked all organizations to
have any news items turned into us by ’I‘uesday night in
order that we may get lull information and make any
changes necessary. This appeal has been flagrantly disre—
garded with the result that the paper in the past has con—
tained many errors and non-essential information.

In order to correct this situation this year, We will re—
quire that all news items be submitted by Tuesday night.
Any items turned in late will not be printed until‘the fol-
lowing week, or, in some cases, will not be printed at all.

Notice

Due to the fact that parking
on Washington Avenue is illegal
until it) a.m. daily on alternate
sides of the street, and a similar
situation eyists on Western Ave-
nue. Campus Commission has
made arrangements for students
to use the parking lot on West-
ern Avenue opposite Draper Hall.

Parking stickers min be obtain-
ed Monday, Tuesday, and Wed-
nesday. People who live outside
of the city of Albany will obtain
their stickers immediately upon
application. It is hoped that
eventually we will be able to
issue stickers to those living
within the city limits.

Entrance to the parking lot is
on Western Avenue and cars
must exit on ’l‘hurlow 'l‘erriicc
only. All stickers must be at-
tached to the vent window on
the right hand side of the cur.

Kids .

To the Frosh . . .

These pictures you see are
just a beginning. They show the
birth of your class. There will be
more pictures of your class on
these pages in the following
years. There will be pictures of
your class officers this winter,
of your class athletes through
all the years. of dances you will
present, of Senators and (‘abi-
net Ministers, of Myslinnia.
members and a Vice—President,
then ll President of the Student
Association; all from your class
and all chronicled in these
pages.

There will be other ways to
record your history to come here
at State ('ollege. There will be
yearbooks. and meetings' min-
utes, and pliiybills, and win-
loss records, and official tran-
scripts, and of course there will
be the drop<out statistics. You
see, frosh, you are already part
of State (‘ollcgc's history. ’l‘hese
pages have begun to make. you
immortal. The more yoli do here
and the better you do it the
deeper entrenched will be your
immortality.

What, you may ask, does all
this mean now'.’ Now you are
about to begin your Rivalry with
the class of lilliil. Nothing more
than that. And oiin three
weeks.

It means that the following
three weeks will have a lot to
do with the next four years. It
means that your now starting
on an important journey, the
destination of which is very dcf-
initcly up to you.

 

it's only a weekend . . .

 

 

You and the night an the music . . . but a beanie.

men.

lleady‘.’ OK.

Here are the first pictures of
your opponents. Most of you will
see them in school for the next
few years. Home of you will see
them on the playing fields of
Rivalry in the next few weeks.
It is hoped that more than some
of you will be there, but the
odds are against it. Against it,
that is. unless you can combat
the traditional “S ophom ore
slump" or whatever they call it.

This “Sophomore slump" bus—
iness is one of the few tradi-
tions left here at State. Your
class seems to have earned a
reputation for breaking tradi-
tions. Perhaps you will again.

At iiin rate, here you are;
your second year. your second
rivalry. What else can be said
to you? There are ii lot of things
to say. but you are wise and
miiture college students now
and undoubtedly consider your-
selves above any advice or even
suggestions.

Perhaps that is where your
great problem lies. You have two
opponents in Rivalry this year:
The frosh and your own cock—
surcness.

Remember it year ago when
you were the scared freshmen?
No one thought that you could
win llivulry either. Well, you
did win, and your opponents
were sure that you wouldn't.
The point is obvious. Is it well
taken?

 

Men are. not that scarce girls . . . you’ll give him a complex.
