STATE COLLEGE N‘EWS FRIDAY. SEPTEMBER 18.

 

 

The Face

By DAVE FE LDMA

Welcome, freshmen, kind con-
gratulations to those who have re-
turned, sorrowful regrets to those
who did not come back, hail muse,
etc. ,

The following are excerpts from
the many letters that I received
during the summer from my friends,
admirers, and many well wishers.

etc.

Yes, you guessed it, little reader,
I received no letters this summer.
That is not to say that I sent any.
Change that! I sent one, but oh, my
poor heart, I received none in re-
turn. I'm not the kind of person to
say “Yes.” We've done wrong. I too
have committed offenses as well as
you. Now we—all of us who are
guilty—should reform.“ Oh, no, I'm
not going to say that. I'm not sorry
that I didn’t write. But aren't you?

What's happened to letter writing?
No one seems to do it any more. Oh,
I just remembered. I did receive
two letters—not counting from my
many relatives—from one person.
Yes, one thoughtful person remem-
bered to write me. No. I never wrote
back. And it’s all your fault. Why
should I write if no one else does?

You lure me into a mumbling in-
competency by setting a bad exam-
ple. You all go bumbling on your
separate but equally misguided ways

and what can be expected? After
a while we are nothing but paper
doll copies of you.

The art of letter writing is lost.
Shot down the drain with the other
lost arts, river boat piloting, colo—
nial architecture, looking at clouds,
black smithing, cross bow firing,
and all the others. They are all
lost. Now letter writing is going
too.

It is very unfortunate that we,
members of the most literate age
that man has ever known do not
have the time, perhaps not even the
ability, to sit down and compose a
letter. If we cannot set our thoughts
straight enough to put on paper,
how do we think? Or do we? Oh.
well, save that for another day.

Now, to get back to the subject,
you don't write letters to anybody,
even if you are mad or glad or no
matter what. Do you all think that
what you have to say is so unim-
portant that no one wants to read
your words? on you poor self con-
scious fools! Even ego-ccntricity is
better than that!

I'll bet that even Mr. Khrushchev
\vrltcs letters. This is not so lin-
portaiit to us since so few of us
can read Russian. Which brings to
mind another thought. Why can't
we?

Sci'mon's over, kiddies, back to
your coffee, or your gossip or your
yo-yos, or whatever you do.

Another step towards the comple-
tion of the College’s residence quad-
rangle was achieved with the open-
ing this fall of the new hall for
male students.

To be known as Men's Hall, until
a permanent name is selected, the
new facility has space for 200 men.
The building's 100 rooms are locat-
ed on three floors, each separated
into three sections, or corridors.

At present, only two corridors are
complete ior occupancy with the
third expected to be finished for
student living *ai'ly next month.
This has necessitated the temporary
assignment of three students iii-
stcad of two, in some of the rooms.

Additional (‘onstruciion

Mcii's Hall is separated froiu
Alden Hall by a patio, which is
unnluc in that it is constructed on
thc roof of the yct-to-be-finished
kitchen and dining area. Sidewalks
of the patio will be intcrspaccd by
slirubbcry and floral patterns.

all 400 students in both Aldcn liall
and the new hall for men. For the
time bcinu, residents of ihcsc two
halls are being fed in existing ac-
commodations: Brubachci'. Saylcs
and Pierce Halls.

final stages of construction for boili
Alden and Men's Hall. Each will be
enlarged by approximately 50 rooms.
enough to :‘iccommodatc up to li.0
students.

These additions will face Ontario
Street in the casc of Alden, and
Partridge Street for Men's Hall.
Upon completion of these wings,
over 1,100 students will be housed
in the residence quadranglc area

It looks like good old State is
about to face her finest year in
the sports world. School spirit
has spirziled to record heights.
Only the other day a Senior was
overheard to ask the spirited
question—“When is Stat» going
to get a soccer team" This is a
rather stupid question since
anyone of the fifty people who
went to last year's soccer games
knows that State already has a
soccer team.

Our stalwart athlcies are in
rare form and ready to go. State
has not spared any expense this
year in subsidizing athletes and
the alumni has come through
with its usual donation of brand
new cars for our athletes. All
in all we can be proud to say
that we go to at school that will
spare no expense in producing
winning teams.

Sports aciion got off to a wild start Saturday at
’l‘hachci' Park. This was the first opportunity for the Frosh
to display sonic of ilicn' afhlctlc pi'ow'css. In the first game
of a softball twin—bill, the counselors squcakcd out a 5—4
triumph. Jim (lrccn's solo home run in the bottom of the
llllll clinchcd ilic victory for the uppcrclassmcn. Follow-
ing this, ihc verdant Grccn—Gi'cmlins came back and
massacred lhc faculty icam, Since I would likc to pass
my courscs this scmcstcr, i will not darc to divulge that
ilic lopsidcd scoi'c was 16 to l.

llcrc is u prcdiciion founded on blind faith, but one
wc arc willing to sicp out on a limb to make. The com-
bination oi lVIyskania (as class guardians) and thc Class
of mod (an cugcr and ialcnicd group) looks like a good bet
to gai'iicr luurcls in this ycai's‘ Rivalry. We were right
in our prediction last your and We bcllcvc that. lightning
can and will strch iwlcc.

as It if

Not long from now ihc sccnc on Vcici'zins' Field will
shift to football. ()ncc again it looks like AMlA (this year
uiidcr lhc pi'csldciicy of Mcrlc Miller) will sponsor another
cxciiing and fast moving intramural touch league. We are
hoping to scc one or two l‘rosh teams in action.

At this ilinc 1 would like to congratulate John Moddcr,
the newly clcctcd Sports Editor of the News. I am conﬁdent
