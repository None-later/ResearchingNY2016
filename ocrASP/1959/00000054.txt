Learning to Learn

Now that the freshmen have had time to establish
themselves and learned to find their way around unassist-
ed, a word of advice is in order. You’ve heard that you
are a hand-picked group, above average in intelligence.
You’re also sensible, thinking people; there's no reason
why you shouldn’t graduate.

You’re predecessors in this school, however, have shown
that not all of you will graduate. The present Senior class,

for instance, retains only 182 of its original 600 class mem-
bers.

A fair percentage of the drOp out figure can be attri-
buted to marriage, loss of interest, and transferring. But
the remainder is what concerns you: the capable students
who just didn’t work enough to keep up their grades. If’
you really want your degree, learn to study; you don’t
have to have a 4.0 to be at graduation, but you can‘t get
there without a 2.0.

The school is overcrowded now, so don't waste your

time here if you re not serious. You can take part in the "WW"! 01' Almmi'b‘ HHSWL‘I' to

campus organizations, can have a good time in college,

as long as nothing strongly interferes with your academic ’
t

endeavors.

can be profitable as well as enjoyable.

Constructive Criticism . . .

Where would this school be without Student govern-
ment? Where would any organization be without some

formal governing body? Think about it for a minute—no, turn
more than a minute. “"11"”
