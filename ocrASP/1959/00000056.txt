The Facade

By DAVE FELDMAN

So you're sitting in the cafeteria.
So you have nothing to do between
classes. Right then and there you
decide that while you're not doing
anything you might as well be
thirsty.

So you decide that you're thirsty
for orange soda. Your sneaky eyes
furtively scan the wall and rest on
the orange soda machine. Your
thirst for orange soda becomes
worse.

You dig into your pocket and ﬁnd
a dime. So you walk up to the ma-
chine iafter tripping over three
chairs nee desks—two frosh and the
guy who cleans the tablest trying
to look composed and hoping that
no one will be aware of your great
thirst or of the orange on your back
(figurative orange, dear reader).

Your tongue is dragging on the
dust as your shaking ﬁngers try
to ﬁnazle the thin dime into a slot
that was designed for warden snakes
by garden snakes. So the dime
drops. To your tortured mind. the
sound is like “The 1812 Overture."
Fourth of July, and the Russians
hitting the moon all at once. You
hesitate while you let your mind
decide between coke and orange
soda. Your mind really knows the

answer, but the hesitation brings
a delicious sense of power to your
reeling brain.

And with a finality, your index
ﬁnger presses the orange soda but-
ton (ah the mechanized wonders of
our society!).

You stand back anticipating the
sight of the cup falling into place
and the soft gurgling of the de—
licious orange soda pouring into it.

And you wait. And you wait. Are
your senses deceiving you? Have
you lost all contact with reality?
There is no cup and no orange
soda,

Your thirst comes back. Now your
throat is parched and buring. You
feel little wisps of sand whip your
ankles.

Anything, even a coke will do.
You press the coke button. Noth—
ing! Absolutely nothing!

All of a sudden your thirst is
gone. Your dime! Your last dime!
Gone into the metal bowels of that
inscrutable machine.

Now you know your enemy! The
Machine. You stab at the coin re-
turn button. You know “~~‘ the
attempt will be futile. And it is.

You kick the machine. You beat
it with your ﬁsts. You knock your
head against it. All to no avail.

With a hardly concealed laughter
that borders upon the hysterical you
watch some girl drop in her (time.
To your great shock she receives
not only an orange soda, but your
dime!

So you walk over to Mabel and
ask her for a carton of milk.

Foreign Scholar
Begins Studies
Al Albany Stale

By DON ALLEN ’63

Otmar Donnenburg is a Fulbright
Scholar from Salzburg, Austria. As
a participant in the Fulbright Pro-
gram, Donnenburg has come to
State as part of an exchange pro—
gram.

He arrived on the USS. halt:-
pendence. landing in New York
September 2. He stayed in Phila-
delphia until coming to State. When
asked what his ﬁrst impressions of
the US. were, Otinar replied, "I
already had an idea of what the
United States was like, from seeing
American travelers, books. films and
magazines. All these gadgets are
new for me. We don't have all this
ice cream and coke."

Otmar went to the Teacher‘s
Training School in Austria and
graduated last J iuie. There he

played handball, basketball and list—
ball, which is comparable to our
volleyball. He also participated in
the Katholische Mittelschule Jug—
eiid, a club similar to Newman
Club. He is enrolled at State as a
special student. and consequently
will not receive any credit for his
work here.

Replacement Elections Soon;
Deixler to Schedule Rivalry

By BOB IIUNEKE

Senate held its first meeting of
the year Wednesday evening in the
Private Dining Room of Brubacher.
This meeting brought back many
not—so-fond memories of last year‘s
Senate sessions.

Approximately two hours were
spent discussing the proposed revi-
sion of dates for Rivalry events.
Much of this time talk included va—
rious opinions concerning the lack
of the “rights of the minority."

After having consumed two hours
of "valuable time," Senior Senator
Battaly came to the realization that
Senate was operating improperly.

Senate then proceeded to start
all over again! The two hour warm-
up proved valuable in that both the
Election Bill and date changes for
Rivalry were passed within ten
minutes.

The Election Bill provides for the
clectioti of two Senators from the
class of 1960, one Senator and a
Treasurer from the class of 1961,
and one Senator from the class of
1962.

Nominations will be held from
Tuesday, September 29, through
Thursday, October 1, in Lower

Draper from 9 a.m. to 4 pin. The

nominations will be held according
to Election Commission Rules and
by the Commission.

Any nominee may decline from
Friday, October 2, through Tuesday,
October ii. The declination proce-
dure will be handled by the Election
Commission.

Voting will be held Wednesday,
October 7, and Thursday. October 8,
in Lower Draper between the hours
of 9 ant. and 4 pm. Only members
of respective classes may vote.

Barry Deixler '61, Chairman of
Rivalry. was given the power to
schedule dates of all Rivalry events.

Fifty dollars was appropriated to
the freshman and Sophomore
classes for Rivalry equipment.

The Senate meeting was held
Tuesday instead of Wednesday ev-
ening. Helwig stated that he
changed the day of the meeting
because, since many Senators are
in sororities, he thought they would
not go to the Senate meeting due
to open houses.

Fowler stated that Student Gov—
iriiinent slioiiid have precedence
other fraternities and sororities. A
Senator's first obligation is to Sin-
ale to which he was elected by
his class.

Group Officers Go All Out

To Recruit Freshmen Talent

I ' Once again the familiar entreaty, “Don’t hesitate—par-
tICIpatei" marks the rapid approach of Activities Day, being
held this year Thursday, from 8 to 10 pm. in the Bru—

bacher gameroom.

According to Judy Skocylas ’61, Chairman of Activities
Day, fourteen campus organizations will set up displays and
w111 outline their functions and existing policies. Heidi Ber-

bary '61, will be in charne of pub-
licity for the event and E311" Byron

‘62, will handle the Arran ement.:'.

Plan Of The Day

It has been announced that the

day will be planned inaiiiiy to satv

isfy the interests of the freshmen.
all of whom are stroneg urged to

attend. The mood of the event. will
be definitely informal. This will
apply both to the Schedule of ac-
tivities and the order of dress.

The plan of events will get off
to a start with an introduction of
the various organizations along with
their leaders and representatives
From then on the freshmen will
have an opportunity to examine the
group displays and gather any de-
sired inf‘ormation from the organi-
zation representatives. The Activi—
ties Day pamphlet which will be on
hand at that time will serve to
summarize the goals and functions
of each group as well as listing the
group officers.

The participatingr organizations
and leaders who will be on hand are
as follows: Pedagogue, June Alex—
ander: Stati- (‘oilege News, Monica
’l‘raskus, Seniors; Debate Council,
