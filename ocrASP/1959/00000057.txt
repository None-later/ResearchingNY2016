STATE COLLEGE NEWS FRIDAY. OCTOBER 2. 1959

 

Activate . . .

This Thursday fourteen organizations will compete for
the talents of the freshman class. Unfortunately, too many
of these freshmen have already acquired the apathy so pre—

valent here, and can see their way clear to participating
in only a good time.

The source of the pseudo-sophistication stems from

the upperclassmen who leave the bridge table just long

enough for a few classes a week. These people are spending

four years in a vacuum and consequently missing a large
part of college life. They feel, however, qualiﬁed to sit back
and adversely criticize the entire campus.

We‘re fairly conﬁdent that the freshmen are capable
of being doers rather than critics. The best way to begin
is to go to Activities Day, and

0 Look at what the various groups have to offer,
0 Choose an activity you’re interested in,
0 Join the organization and play an active part.

Losing Our Marbles?

When we were in grade school, spring and fall were
“marble season." Nothing could draw little boys away from
a game of marbles after school, and who would want to,
for this was good, clean fun.

Now, marbles is a game of skill and dexterity; you can’t
become an expert over night. A boy with a full bag of
honestly-won marbles had something to be proud of. But
think of the child who failed at the game: he was doomed
to be a Feifl'er-like misﬁt, an outcast.

Isn’t it a pity that vocational training, guidance, and
John Dewey weren't in vogue when we were young? Per—
haps then some of the more mundane subjects like arith-
metic and geography could have been replaced by forty
minutes of instruction in the art of playing marbles. You
and I could have (if we passed the Regents) been graduated
well-rounded, socially aware citizens able to face our peers
conﬁdent in the knowledge that we were skilled in that
great participant sport. We could enter any group on an
equal footing with the IN people; we could have been whole
children.

Fact or Rumor?

The rumor has circulated, this week, the the Home—
coming Dance and the Junior Prom will be held on campus
this year in order to discourage, the use of alcohol. Well,
isn’t it true? —-No it isn’t. But in typical gossip fashion,
everyone has heard and spread the “fact.”

in the ﬁrst place the policy of the administration con-
gerrliing alcohol is succinctly stated in the Freshman Hand-
oo <.

‘ In the second place the rumor ’as‘ completely un-
founded. On the basis of past experience we don’t see how
it could be believed.

And thirdly. we're glad it isn't true.
