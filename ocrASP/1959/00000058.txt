From Veterans‘ Field Stadium came the strains of a familiar tal—
though slightly irregulai'i clicci'. Between two ditches, undoubtedly due.
by some contemporary PAUL BUNYAN or eager beaver, s(|llec/.c plays
and definitely unheard of plays took place such as had ncvcr bccn staged

before on—a softball field.

What started as a quiet innocent game of Softball rapidly developed
into a violent, ripping contest of laughs.
A fielder was often heard making the complaint I just broke my

fingernail. Hey. can I bat?

Sure. if ya. know how. (let

up there and

kill it. but don't break another fingernail. Whatla _\:i doin' with pennies
in your shoes? I bought a pack of cigarettes and that's the two cents

change.

The ditches tmore recognizable us gtillicsi were lllI‘ scene of a lovely
Softball Ballet silli‘l'lllL‘, members of the rescue squad. A ten looi diop
bordered the field on the left side and they lost more lcftlicldcrs that way.

At first avid Softball fans sat along the sidclines unnoticed by the
players, engrossed in their superior method of play. As the l'.|lllt' coli-

tinued the onlookers dwindled away play by play. rlllL'll‘ by .-\llI:.lt'

Iniuries and Mental Lapses

Hamper State

State’s varsity, which managed to
play dead for a few minutes during
intervals of their loss at FDU last
Saturday, will make another try at
the win column tomorrow after-
noon when it makes the trip into
Western New York to meet Geneseo
tomorrow afternoon.

The Pods made themselves wel-
come in New Jersey when they gave
up eight goals to allow the locals
to set a new record. Frank Fallace
was the lone Ped not let in on the
secret, having the audacity to score
a goal at 19:28 of the second period
to ruin a shutout for goalie John
Santos.

FDl' Strong

Much of the credit for the low
St ate prodi'ction must go to Santos
who did play a great game for FDU
in the nets; however. the score,
which at half—time was 2-1 in favor
FDU. Would have been much
closer if the Feds had not made
mental lapses that virtually handed
the game to FDU.

thii the Fed attack did jell, it
produced soni” great play that would
have hurt a lesser goalie. But the
scoring punch of FDU and their
fine defensive play at times held
the Feds down and made the score
l inc-sided
(‘olburn Ilurt

The State squad was hampered by
injuries, suffered from the first few
iiiinutes of the game when Dave
Colburn broke his nose. throuin the
:illdll‘ and may hurt the team to—
iiioi'row it Genesco.

Colbin'ii gained the honor of get-
ting the first injury of the season
in competition when he and an FDU
m:iii crashed togethir iii the first
two minutes. Later in the game
Frank Fallacc, scoring ace from
A'Iincola. was hurt on a scoring at-
tempt and may not see action to-
marrow.

Ed Walin also came out of the
game with injuries but may see ac—
tion tomorrow. The Florida, New
York. boy played a good game in
the Fed cause as did Chuck Reces-
n), Bill ’i‘hoi'npson, and Karl Ger-
stcnbm'gcr. but the drive to push for
a score seemed to be lacking as the
Feds faltcrcd and fell apart several
times during the game.

The game tomorrow afternoon
could go either way. but unless the
round plays the type of bull that
was oiilv seen in flashes, it looks like
a Ciciicseo win toiiiorrow'. This team
is not the test at. State there have

been better clubs—but it can pull
itself together and play a good
brand of ball and pull a win out.
li‘rosh Ready

The freshman squad also gets in-
to action tomorrow afternoon when
it makes the trip to OCCC for the
opener there. Freshman coach Bob
Burlinganic has been working his
men hard and should have some
news for the Middletmvn boys to-
morrow-«but if the freshman squad
is no more consistent than the var-
sity was last Saturday there will be
a win for OCCC tomorrow.

Notes from here and there: Marty
Borko and Merle Miller also deserve
credit for a great deal of good play
. Fallace's injury is responding
to treatment but will hamper him
if he is able to play . . . Dave Col—
biirn may be back in action soon . . .
the Fed attack forced FDU goalie
Santos to make 15 saves . . . Dick
Cox had 14 saves for State . . . the
Feds defeated Geneseo last year at
Albany but two years ago, at Gene—
seo. Stat: dropped a 3—1 decision...
three season's ago State won a 5-0
Verdict. this trip marks the
longest for the Feds of the season,
as the team leaves Friday afternoon
for Rochester . . . Next Wednesday
State goes to RPI.

Vols Pull Upset

An underdog Tenneswe team
pulled the top upset of the week by
beating Auburn by the margin of a
field goal. It snapped the Tigers'
streak at 24 games without a less.
The final score was. of course, 3-0.
(‘oiirad Goes Wild

Last Sunday, Bobby Joe Conrad
of the Chicago Cardinals scored 25
points on three touchdowns and
seven conversions to spark a 49-21
triumph over the Washington Red—
skins.
It's Hollywood Stuff

Missouri‘s victory over Michigan
was straight out of a Hollywood
script. Bob Haas, a second-string
quarterback. scored the winning
touchdown from the one yard line
with two seconds left after the Wol—
verines had taken it 15»ch lead less
than 3 minutes before.
