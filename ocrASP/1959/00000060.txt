Bridge Anyone? . . .

0, ye sages of the Era Private Dining Room; ye high,

mighty, and powerful; ye members, and observers.

When you goof, in those rare instances, you get the
same news coverage you always get. News reporters this

         

 

Notice

Results of replacement elec-
tions held Wednesday and
Thursday were announced today
by ltobert Helwig, President of
Strident Association. They are
as follows:

semester, last semester, the term before that, and the term

before that, have always played up your goofs and for a

reason.

The student body should know what‘s going on in
Senate, but is reluctant to read a straight report of the
meeting. Let‘s face it—much of your work is run-of-the-
mill and downright boring. Only when you‘re foolish are
you interesting. Also, when you‘re foolis1——you are going

to be in print.

By the way, if you‘re real good, you‘ll get honorable

mention.

Soccer Anyone? . . .

Tomorrow afternoon at 2 State will play its ﬁrst home
soccer game against Adelphi. You should be there. Instead
of complaining because we don‘t have a football team, try
going to a soccer game this year. Why?

0 According to a former sports editor this year‘s team
is “a good club.”

0 The soccer team has been in practice since Fresh—
man Weekend; its work shouldn‘t be for nothing.

0 The team‘s record includes 1 win and 2 losses. You
should be interested to see what else they‘re going to do.

0 State beat Adelphi last year and has a good chance
to repeat the victory.

To sum up, State’s soccer team deserves the support
of the student body as much as the basketball team or a
football team.

Your only regret will be that you didn‘t start going
sooner!
EAS.

Photography Anyone? . . .

Last spring after a series of discussions with members
of the State College News, l’edagogue, and State College
PhotoService we were forced to disband the Service because
of lack of membership. We were also forced to admit that
both publications could not function without its aid,

Professional photographers were hired for both tltc
News and Perl but we must rely on Photoscrvicc for all
informal pictures because We can‘t get our liit‘ctl photogs
over to school, the football game, or soccer practice after—
noons.

If possible we would like to rebuild the l’hotoscrvicc
with members of the student body wlio itavc a genuine
interest in photography and have the time to devote to
this group. We’d like to start now so that we may plan
on using the Service for all pictures next, year.

It is with glad hearts that we
witness this onslaught of foul
weather. It makes most (and we titt-
derline lllofiti forms of outdoor cit-
tcrtaiiuncnt nigh impossible. Most
of you Will be forced to decide lic—
twccn a movie or a bar this week-
end. If it's a movie. you've come to
the right place.

Last Friday, we were approached
by a. fresh who said, and we quote.
"Do you really see all those movies?“

Tuesday, when we stopped laugh-
ing long enough to give the frosli
an answer it had disappeared. Hor-
rible screams were heard coming
from the vicinity of the peristyics.
iSeems it was a commuter and had
parked in thc lot, without benefit. of
a parkingr sticker. We don‘t want to
wire away any secrets, but some of
the military were seen iii the lot
measuring the depths of the rats.

Well anyway, to answer that frosh
wherever it may be. How else would
we be able to write such ingenious-
ly constraitive titovie evaluations if
we didn't put our hearts and soul
