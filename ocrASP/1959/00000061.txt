schedule cards on the desk co-

Library Displays
Faculty's Boo/<5

In case not many of you have
noticed, there is now on display in
Hawley Library, a sampling of books
written by various faculty members.

These books are only a few of the
creative works of our professors,
showing that not all time is spent
in the classroom. Any instructor
who writes a book usually donates
two copics to the library: one is
placcd in with the circulatii'ri
books. and the other is put on the
faculty book shell in thc Hawlcy
coiilci'cnco room. Many books writ—
ten by State teachers are now bc~
in; used as text books in some high
schools.

The library has copies of books
writti-n by curri-nt faculty mcmbcrs.
Books ‘.\'l'lll.'ll by nu‘cnbcrs who have
since lci't State. are not included in
the. pcrmancnt tiles, since thcrc
would be a space problem, Articles
in pcriodicnls arc only ll‘.':lllliIJlt.‘ if
the library has a subsurlption to
that periodical.

There is a pamphlet iii the libran
cnlitled “Publications oi' the Facili—

CASDA Seeks to Establish

By ROBERT

Since 1940 people have been walk—
ml: by a room on the first floor of
Richardson. looking at the letters
CASDA printh on the door. and
have been continuing on without so
much as a sccond thouuht. It a pm"-
stlll was to ask the student popula-
tion what CASDA was. or what its
functions were. thcir answer would
probably llt- "who km or bcttcr

that new cducational mcthods were
