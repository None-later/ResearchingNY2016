From This Corner:
Soccer Opener
At Bleecker

By JOHN MODIHCR

 

A constant hum comes from the streets through the
windows into my ears and all I can hear is who's going to
win the Series. and about the Dodgers. The hum is almost
deai‘ing. it blocks out all other noises but beneth this mighty
hum I can manage to hear the heavy breathing of a few
men who know that baseball season is over and another
spoit is here. Up at Bleecker Stadium there isn‘t any talk
of the Series. instead it is hard work trying to get in shape
tor the first home game of the season. Under JOE GAR-
ClA'S watchful eye the soccer team is going through its
drills as it there were no series so that they may present
to the students of this college a victory.

T icy are doing their part to help bring a good Soccer
team to State. HOW ABOUT YOU? Will you be tip at
Bleecker Stadium ‘to see the ﬁrst home game against
Adtlphi.‘ Or will you be in the Union reminiscing about

3 the Series or the date you had last night. REMEMBER
THIS IS YOUR TEAM. You can make it a good team or a

poor one. A few cheers and a lot of friendly faces can go
a long way to help win a game. The team has the talent
but it also needs the spirit and backing of the students.
So how about it. lets start this season with a new attitude
and get up to Bleecker to see the ﬁrst home game.

The AMIA football season got off to a great start this
yeti: Not only did old man weather treat us well, but the
Jail players themselves did. There was some good rockem
‘ockem ball played this week by all the teams.
Highlight of The Week

The highlight oi this weeks action was the HUMPS
touchdown against Potter Club. Going into the season

: Potter had not been scored on in eight games, a span of
. a year and a half. But 21 DZ Koucy to Mann pass put an

end to this dynasty of not being scored upon.
All Starts ()f The Week
The following are my choice for ALL STAR of THE
WEEK because of their stellar play in this Weeks action.
OFFENCE——Rt. End. Baker (SLS); Rt. Guard. Geh-
hart (Pootter); C, Mitchell (KB); L. Guard, Lewis (SLS);
L. End, Mann (Humps): QB, (Potter); LHB, Pcnﬁeld
(Sayles): RHB. Lynch (KB); Fl}. Call (Potter).
DEFENCE—"Rt. End, Gilbert (KB); Rt. Guard, Altman
(Potter); C. Donato (APA); L. Guard, Ellis (KB); L. End,

Sayaric (Potter): RLH, Burton (Kl-5); MLB, Thumhcart

(SLS): LLB. Pollaro (APAl: Safety, Johnson (SLS).

As I See It

Sayles is illl‘ icam to watch. I'oticr still ihc team to beat.
(loobers can bc tough if they solve their QB problems.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS.FR|DAY. OCTOBER 9. 1959

:  Has New Look
 ‘ g

By JIM l)()l‘GIIICR'l‘Y

The field goal has reittrned to
college football with dramatic sitti-
deness! Willi the 19:39 season only
three weeks old. it is apparent that
the field goal will be a potent
scorina factor and will be used
ol'icii by the (:ollcuc lcams.

Examples

'l‘cmicssce upsct Atibitrii by the
lllzll‘ulll of a lit-id coal. Alabama
also used lhc licld coal for its
only points of the game as they
(left-ach Houston 3—0. LSU has
kicked three field goals in as many
games.

Why The Switch?

Why are the colleges now going
for the field goal, a play rarely
used in recent years? Fritz Cris-
lci', naiioiially-kiiown Univ. of Mi-
chigan athletic director and long
time member of the NCAA Rules
Committee, has the answer.

"This year the cross-bar over
the goal posts was widened from
18 feet 6 inches to 21! feet 4 inches,
an increase of about one—third.
This new rule not only makes it
easier to kick a field goal, but
has focused new attention on this
method of scoring."

Psychological Advantage

’l'cains that would iic\cr consider
using a field goal bcfoi‘c are now
doing so because they realize how
valuable 3 points can be and how
casin it can be achieved \\llll tlic
widcr cross—bar, Some of the ad-
\'aiitauc is psychological, of course,
but more field goals int-an more
exciting games, and certainly lcss
tics. For example in :34 lll:l_]til’
camcs two weeks aeo there was
not a single tic, a rather unusual
item in itself.

Pros Are Successful

The professional teams have
bccn using the field .roal with
llilli'll success ior ycars because the
coal posts are locutcd on the coal
liiic instead of ten yards behind
it as they are in collccc football.
Also they lia\c (lc\clopcd flit-id
mull kicking >pccialists such as
l.oit t’l‘lic 'l‘oci (ii'o/.a oi the (,‘lc-
\cland iii-owns, who has kickcd
