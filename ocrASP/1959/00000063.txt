STATE COLLEGE NEWS.FRIDAY. OCTOBER 9. 1959

 

14W 6/ State

 

By PAT LaBALBO

What's so sad and disillusioning
about encouraging school spirit?
What's wrong with admitting you
have any? It's not sophisticated.
And we all want to be sophisticated,
don‘t we? Besides, if we weren’t
blase and cynical then the enrolled
masses and the News would have to
find something else to talk and
grumble about.

Oh yes, it's true, State has a
craekerbox gym, seine very poor
teachers, no campus, a quantity of
ehtibby girls and eifiminate boys and
only four fraternities. If it is at all
possible, let's be realistic for a ino-
ment. It‘s hard here, but try. Every
campus has defects, so why use
these excuses? Why use any excuse
at all for cynicism? And what's so
acceptible about encouraging
pseudo-sophistication and apathy?

Did you know that one out of four
students at State has a Regents
Scholarship? That students are ac-
cepted partly on the basis of a min-
imum 1.62.. that most of the facts
that the administration throws out
about “cream of the crop", etc., is
true, even if it is propaganda?

If you're honest you really don't
have much of an excuse for being
ashamed of State when you come
right down to it. So why be asham-
ed? Why by cynical?

When the Class of ’62 arrived we
got the old treatment of polite tol-
erance for enthusiasm, and we
quickly learned that to belong you

had to frequent the local taverns,
be casual about classes, bad marks,
and above all, be APATHETIC. So
we were. But it was a mistake, as a
few brave individuals will admit in
private.

Speaking optimistically and un-
sophisticatedly, it's not too late to
get out of the rttt. And why not
take the still-enthusiastic freshmen
with us! They've got lots of pep
and go and it could spread if it
was encouraged.

Let's plate more emphasis on the
wide variety of activities offered
here besides the ones conducted in
bars and back cafeterias and Greek
houses. Let‘s meet our friends at
football and soccer games. Let's use
