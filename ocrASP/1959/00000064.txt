Do we still have a service on this campus known as
a State College Directory? If so, will we have the publica-
tion out in time to address valentines? Call out Fowler,
we need an investigation!

In the past lists were posted with names, addresses,
and phone numbers in order that students might make
the necessary corrections. These lists were up for about
three weeks. So far, no lists!

Every year, same problemhno cover design. This holds
up publication another month. So far no problem!

Taking the above into account plus the length of time
necessary to publish a work of that nature, just when will
the Directory be released to the students?

By the way, congratulations to the new editor. Who
is it this week?

Yea! Rah! Cha! Cha! . ..

Are you tired of hearing the strains of “Buckle Down
Oh State” and “Fight Team Fight”? Well so are we, that's
why we’re doing something about it. It's about time, we
think, for revisions.

MT.

The State College News is sponsoring a contest. (Gung
Hol, aren’t we?) We’re looking for new cheers and songs
that are really lively and different. Let's get away from
the same old trite cheers that sound as though they could
ble used in a dragged out, monotonous, corrective speech
c ass.

This is your big opportunity to respond to the needs
of your school, athletes, and fellow students. Now don’t
sit back in your chair and say in your whimsical way, “I
can’t write cheers,” or “Let someone else worry about that.”

Freshmen and Sophomores have proven that they have
ability and talent in writing cheers and songs for rivalry.
If they can do it for their classes, we know they, as well as
Juniors and Seniors, can do it for their school.

Come on you pseudo-sophisticates “come down, come
down from your ivory towers” and get the mechanism in
your cerebellum operating. The cheerleaders (and we real-
ly appreciate their splendid work) need your new ideas and
continued support.

H Help feed the moths in your pockets. There will be
gift certificates redeemable at the co-op for the winners.
For further details see story on page 1.

Now put down this paper and WRITE AWAY!

B.J.L,

:j: :r.
Go out and support Homecoming, remember someday
you too may be an alum.

The work put forth to make this Weekend a success will
never be appreciated if only the multitudes of Albany
pigeons attend.

_ ' Best of wishes, luck, and thanks go to John Jones and
Ginny Dehncrt for their planning of this chkt'lltl.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS FRIDAY. OCTOBER 16.

 

80mmle

 

To the editor:

For personal reasons, I would like
to submit my resignation as Co-
Editor—in-Chicf of the State College
News. This has stemmed primarily
from a basic disagreement with the
policy of co-editorship.

I‘ve enjoyed working with the
paper and regret having to make
this decision.

Elizabeth A. Spencer

To the editor:

l have just come home from the
Andre Eglevsky Ballet and the turn
out ‘or lack of it' on the part of the
student body has made me quite ill.
To have so many empty seats in a
947 rt‘lll auditorium with a student
body of well over 2000 is something
of which to be ashamed. One can-
not receive all his education from
books. so Sti'dcnt Association chan-
iicls our money“ collected through
Student Activities l'ees~—to different
student organizations with the pur—
pose of broadening the experiences
of each student at this college. Each
student here had bought his ticket.
but so few bothered to pick it up
(without doubt so that he could
boast of ll punch-free tax card».
Missing one night‘s homework won't
drop anyone from this college‘s ros«
ter and I‘ve yet to see a well round-
ed liberal arts program conic tuni-
bling out of books.

Let me suggest that some of you
book worms crawl out of the leaves
and sortie of you bar-flies roost in
Page Hall when the Canadian Play-

ers come in November and when
Rise Stevens comes in December.
Andre Eglcvsky and lit“. troupe

weren't paid $1,000 to liniber up: the
Canadian Players aren't being paid
Sl_500 to rehearse; Rise Stevens
isn't receiving $2,000 to sing scales
in her bathrootii; they are being
paid with your money for your bene-
fit, No one of you would pay $25-$50
for textbooks and then throw them
in tonight's bonfire. so why not, take
advantage of that for which you've

already paid? 'i‘hesc artist aren't
in New York City where you
would have to pay $7 a ticket; they

are lit re at State where. for the price
of a painlc:-s punch of your student
l.i.\( card. you can enjoy Illi‘ll‘ talents.
Maybe it‘s too easy. it long lines
and outrageous prices were llllllltlﬁl.
there'd probably be Standing ltoom

Today is the one-lnindredth an-
niversary of the sensational raid
of John Brown on Harper's Ferry.
Virginia. There. dear people. was
a man who fought for what he be—
lieved: a man who, with an army
of but 22 men dared to take drastic
action to forward a cause which he
firmly believed to be both right
and important.

Yet. look at Ilie ultimate results!
Arc we to condemn him for inciting
one oi the bloodiest battles ever
iouelit on our nation‘s soil, or are
we to ciih him “hero” for at least
attempting to remedy a situation
which had plagued our country for
cciiturics before'.’

()ur attitudes towards .loliii Brown
and his claim to fann- depend a
great deal upon the value we set
on the importance and manners of
becoming well-known or famous.
Most of us have. whether we ad-
n‘it it or not. a desire within our—
selves to be known —— those of us
who cannot acquire fame may often
content oursehes with infamy.

For those of you. especially the
freshmen and transfers. who will
admit that you are seeking your
"place in the sun". your opportunity
to gain tame and friends. we offer
these carefully compiled and sure—
iire suggestions.

any smile, but one which you can
beam at any stranger you meet at
school. hoping he tor Shel is one of
the few on campus who “matters”.
With a little ltick. you jttst might
manage to flash those beautiful
"thirty-twos" at someone who will
come in handy later on.

2. Choose a neurosis. If you can—
not. find .1 suitable one. any sort of
emotional conflict will do. Make this
acquired problem evident isubtly,
of course). People will then think
you are very sensitive to life. and
therefore extremely intelligent.

3. Learn to learn to play bridge.
It doesn't matter if you already
know how Ins if anyone can ever
really know how» You must find
as many people as possible to teach
you. and never bid so that your
instructor. when he is your part-
ner, can understand you.

4. Never, nevvr claim to under—
stand anyone. Although it is true
that people crave understanding. it
is truer yet that no one likes to
adiiiii. that he is simple enough to
be understood.

:3. Be able to listen to all the ad-
yice with which you will be flooded,
but also be able not to take any
of it, gracefully.

For those of you who dare to be
extremists, we offer these additional
tips.

1. Either praise everyone and
everything. or knock everyone and
everything. If you‘re an optimist.
people will invariably come to you
for positive reassurance when they
tiiiiik they're wrong. If you‘re a
skeptic and a pessimist people will
consider you a deep thinker, one
who is not led by blind faitii.

2. Either know evcryoiic's name,
or no onc's. if you know them all.
you will be considered very friendly
and personable. On the other hand.
it you know no oiie‘s name. people
will think you must be Very impor-
iaiit so busy and actiyc that you
haven't the time to remember un-
important details like names. You
will be respected for your impor-
lllllt‘tl.

(it course these have only been
suggestions. and there is a slight
possibility that they may not work,
although they have thus far provcn
to be very reliable. If all else fails.
liow'e\er. we offer one filial helpful
hint. start. another Civil War!
