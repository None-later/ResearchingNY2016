Student Apathy
At Bleecker

By JOHN MUDDI‘IR

 

Congratulations to the sttidcnts of STATE. For the
first time in many a soccer game we had more fans than
pigeons at Bleecker! .

l was also told by a cheerleader to compliment you.
Is was the first time she had some response from you. You
really had her worried; she was beginning to think that
you were non—cxtstcnt, btit you restored her faith in you.
‘ Maybe 1 have a lot to learn about human idiosyn—
crasies but 1 just can‘t understand you students at STATIC.
Here we have a great socccr team; a team that goes out
for every game and fights with all its heart to win for you
and you just sit there like bumps on a log. What‘s wrong?
Do you lose your Vtiit‘t's when you pct to l-llccckcr'.’ licavcn
knows you‘re foiid cnoueh around campus!

11' you have read this article this far you have already
catapoi‘tzed inc as sarcastic and cynical pist (like everyone
else on this paper but 1 wrote this because a liillt‘ boy from
LaSallc School askctl inc at the panic “WIIY DON‘T 'l‘IllC
KIDS A'I‘ STATE CHEER!“ 1 wish he could have asked
cacli and cycry one of' you. What would you havc said‘.’
l‘l‘ll’ RALLY ()N VETS li‘llClJ) V

A 1’cp Rally will bc run by llii' cliccrlt-zulcrs this li‘riday
iiitc on Vet's li‘icfd. The rally will be used to drum up spirit
for the soccci' game Saturday. Since spirit at S’I‘A’l‘lt‘ is
almost (lead I strongly i't-comizicnd lliat you be there.
Maybe some of the chccrlcadcrs can bring you back to lift“.

There is hope not only for a. soccer
field. but a baseball diamond as well
-—and there were just dreams a few
years ago when the ﬁrst homecom-
iny, came was played.

State played a variety of teams in
the seven y tar homecoming history,
iiicludinu Ostvecgo tbcat cm 4-1 in
19561 Adelphi. 8 rid a c p o r t, and
Plattsbt'ruh.

Record (‘rowd

Favored in 1957 by perfect weather.
the Pcds played before one of the
l)li’,}.’,('$l.. crowds in the soccer history
of the college over 1.()0()—-—l)ut lost
the game by a. 6—3 count. Thc l(l.‘-S
was a touch one for State, who
spottcd the Panthers a. pair of quick
goals and then never made tip the
deficit. The Adclphi team of that
year the one beaten by State this
_\car in f)\'(‘1'illiiC——\\'115 one of the
few that. have managed to spoil
State‘s homecoming.

1958 saw a spirited turnout in a
Ctiltl. damp drizzle. The crowd was
wc11 rewarded as the Feds shocked
everyone btit themselves by trounc-
fill; a liiéthly favored Oswcgo team
in a 6-1 name.

That was Art Hackett's day of
t'loi‘y as he scorcd three of the State
eo'ils. Then a Junior, the fullback
from Cairo. New York was unstop-
able as 11c took charge of a power-
ful Pcd attack that caught Osweigo
completely unprepared.
llelsignorc Shines

By 1958 the cra of Carl Maxson‘s
tt'rcat play had gone and his leader-
ship on the field had been replaced
by that of Lou Dclsignorc and Gus
'l‘iliman. '1'hat pair teamcd tip to
ttirn in oi'tstandinu illillit‘s‘ that day
and Lou t-vcn tallit d onc of his rare
poals iroiii thc fullback spot he held.
It was not his job to score coals.
