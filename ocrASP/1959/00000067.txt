Senate:

STATE COLLEGE NEWS.FRIDAY. OCTOBER 16.

gnate-Go-Round' Includes Discussion
Of SUB Activities, Camp Board Committee

Report, Talk. Table

At this weeks meeting, Senate
discussed many. many, many topics,
reversed its attitude on one of them,
and came to some conclusions on a
few.

Accomplishments

The ﬁrst thing done by Senate
was to swear in the newly elected
senators. As usual. not all of the
senators were present at this session.

A request from Student Union
Board was then announced. asking
for $100 to be used to litre a band
for a dance on October 24. Senate
discussed the advantages of holding
dances on weekends when nothing
else is scheduled.

Members of SUB pointed out that
a total of almost 600 people attended
the last two such dances. and that
since they were so successful, they
should be continued.

It was pointed out that SUB asked
for a floating fund to provide for
such dances a couple of weeks ago
and that. at that time. Senate re-
fused to allocate funds. If Senate
decided to give SUB this money it
would be reversing its former de-
cision.

After more discussion the motion
was put to a vote and passed. This.
of course. meant that Senate had
Contradicttd a former decision.
Camp Board

A committee was set. up to meet
with Camp Board to discuss future
legislation concerning State's camp
at Dippikill.

The first topic reported on was the
request by the Business Department
that Strident Association buy its own
duplicating machine. A decision was
postponed until the matter could be
further investizated.

A report was then given concern-
ing the proposed payment by Stu—
dent Association of all or part of
the costs of sending representatives
to the Eastern States Science Con-
ference. After quite a bit of discus-
sion it was pointed out that Senate
should not commit itself until more
information is available.

Another report was given concern-
ing the proposal that State join the
National Silrdeiit Association. The
merits of this organization were
pointed out and Senate decided to
contact other colleges which belong
to this organization and to postpone
further action to a later date.

ica 'l‘rasizus. Editor-in-Cliicf of the
