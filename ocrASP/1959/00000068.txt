Senate meeting is still going on
but. since I don't plan to stay up
all night writing this column, I left
early. For the last half-hour, Sen-
ate has been discussing Robert's
Rules of Order.

Flash! . . . Flash!

President Helwig just called this
reporter to thc Senate meeting!
No . . . Not. because they missed
me. .'.n "erroneous" statiinent was
made in this column last week. Since
I am unalle to quote everything
exactly as it was said, I will do my
best to report nothing "erroneous"
this week.

Agenda.

The “bill for election of Campus

The next item on the agenda was
the second reading of a “Motion

Senate then discussed a request
by Music Council to a . . . well. I‘d

After much discussion. President
Helwig is quoted as saying “This is
how we tact all fouled up." The ino-

concerned with an est-hange program
between the above mentioned college
and State. I have no more "quotes"
so I wdi say no more about. it.

A letter from Skidmore College
was then read. This letter concerned
a tonlcrenee which will take place
the weekend of December 4, After
the theme of the conference, “Af-
rica's Challenge to the World," was
announced, there were many “com—
ments” made by many people. I can
quote here: “Don't suppress it, have
a good lunch"; “Send a safari to
Africa"; and finally, “Let‘s be seri-
