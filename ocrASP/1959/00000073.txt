STATE COLLEGE NEWS FRIDAY. OCTOBER 30.

Peds Drop Fifth Tilt To
Oswego, Face Bridgeport

By DAVE MILLER.

State‘s booters, with two home
games left on a sorry 1959 schedule.
will be seeking their fourth win of
the season tomorrow when they
tangle with powerhouse Bridgeport
in a 2 pm. tilt at Bleecker Stadium.

Bridgeport brings a 5-0 record
into the game to provide the Feds
an excuse should they drop their
sixth game of the season. followed
by Montclair next weekend.

Lose to Oswego

A typical Great Lakes storm, that
howled off Lake Ontario in the
third quarter. made the field at
Oswego as dark as late evening and
drenched it in a matter of minutes
as well as blow into the players’

Keglers Tie
Union 2-2

The State keglers are off and
turning in hopes of coping their
first intercolegiate Bowling Cham-
pionship. Monday night they came
from behind to tie a good Union
team 2—2. State lost the first two
games but won the third and most
pins to earn the tie.

State Team

Bowling for State were John
Eckleman. Max Tochner, Charles
Carlson, Tony Conetta, and Cap-
tain Bruce Bibbins.

Big guns for State were Bruce
Bibbins and Charles Carlson.

Bruce had the high triple, bowl-
ing 572 (188-190-194).

Carlson had high single game of
210.

Present Record

State’s record now is 7‘9 wins
and 4‘2 loses. They have beaten
HVT 2‘2-1‘: and ABC 3-1.

faces during the period. It was no I

test of soccer as the team slid
about in the mud and the referees
did not stop the game in spite of
a rule permitting it under such
circumstances.
Lack Drive

It was the same old story other-
wise. Tlre Peds lacked the real urge
to win, that drive that character-
ized past teams. and played the
game like it was a glorified gym
class—and only a few, like Ron Cos-
lick. who deserves credit for a great
showing in his appearances this

fall-forgot that it didn‘t matter if .

the team lost and tried to do some-
thing about winning the game in in-
stead of bettering his own team-
mates.

That seems to have been the pat-
tern this season. After accidentally
winning at Geneseo, the Feds for-
got themselves against RPI and
played ball the way it should be
played. They barely managed to
beat Adelphi. There was seine spir—
it back for the Plattsburgh game,
but it evaporated when the game
ended.

The Feds were outplayed in the
first half of the Oswego game, be-
fore the weather became a factor,
and the State lead at the half would
not have held up at the pace Os-
wego was setting.

Day of Redemption

Tomorrow. however. the Feds
have their chance to redeem them-
selves. The Bridgeport team is
beatable. All it takes is the desire
to take the game seriously enough
to want to win-not just go through
the motions. and at the end of the
game shrug your shoulders and say,
“who cares?"

State fans care. This reporter
cares. And. deep down, every man
on that team cares. They owe it
to themselves. to the fans. and to
the players who are really pushing
to win—to beat Bridgeport.

As I See It‘

“Old Vets

Never Die”

By JOHN MODDER
“Old vet’s never die they just go on and on and on.“

 

 These words were taken from that great immortal vct

John Burkel who is the captain, head coach, and star cen—
tor for the Goobers A.C. These words came true to life on
Veterans’ Field the other day when the Goobers AC. beat
a very good SLS team 6 to 0.

Talking to John before the game, he said that thc
Goobers were a very sound team and that they had tlic
best defensive line in the league. Bad breaks and mcntal

‘ lapses caused their four defeats.

John took a bunch of vets and molded them into a
well conditioned ball club. The average age of tile tcam is
23 years of age. Ken Taylor and Steve Hoovcr who arc 15)
and 20 respectively pull the average down to a l‘t‘spct‘lzll)lt'
average. The average weight of the team is 187 pounds.
Speedy Barr and Jerry Pickard. who both wcigh 151) soak-
ing wet, have the honor of dropping this statistic. Despite
these slight disadvantages the Goobers havc that onc thing
that makes a poor team good—Spirit. Nicc going Goobers.

Goobers Upse’r Sigma Lambda Sigma 6-0;
Alpha Pi Alpha, Mens Hall, Score Wins

Wednesday afternoon the Goobers
AC. surprised the sports world and
earned Potcr Club‘s undying ad—
miration by upsetting SLS by a 6-0
score. (It would have been 12-0 ex—
cept for another momentary lapse
by the league‘s “Old Reliable" ref-
crec.)

Play on the sunshining and frigid
afternoon was featured by gale force
winds and the defensive line play
of both teams. That grand old man
of footballmDick Corcucru played
his usual great gnmc. making many
and often strategic tags on the SLS
bucks deep in thcir own backfield.
Austin and chb pliiycd good ball
both ways as (lid the rest of the
ball club. Six kcy interceptions by
the Goober secondary and tcrtiary,
aided by the hard charging defen-
sive line and the al‘orcincntionui
wind. held SLS at bay all after—
noon.

The first scorc came halfway
through the third quarter on an 8
yard pass from Ken Taylor to Con—
nie Schmidt. The sccond~—as this
observer and many on ihc sidelines
(including two rcfcrccsi saw it ~
came on a 13 yard end swccp by
Taylor which was not allowed by
the ever alcrt. watchful. and incpt
“Old Reliable" who has continually
plaqucd the league all year long by
his calls from 111 or 15 yards in back
of the play.

AI‘A vs. Sayles

The mcn of Alpha Pi Alpha got
back on the \\'liilllllL’ way with a. 14
to 13 victory ovcr Saylcs. The game
was even closcr than ihc score in-
dicaied.

Saylcs Hull scored on the fifth
play of the uamc when Burncit
passed to Jim llucnhn for at ten-
yard score. APA. not to bc oni—
donc, came right back on the nch
V

series of plays to score on a 40-yard
pass play from Polero to Tillman.
The extra point was good.

Early in the second quarter Jim
Dougheriy intercepted one of Bur-
nett‘s flat passes intended for Pen-
iicld and raced 85 yards for the
score. It was the longest run-back
of an intcrccptcd pass this year.

Sayles got their last touchdown
late in the fourth quarter on a 10-
yard puss from Burnett to Gary
I-‘cnficld. The cxira point attempt
was missed, this giving APA the
victory.

A lot of crcdit has to be given to
the APA dcfcnsc line for its stellar
play. All afternoon they played with
lhcir backs against the wall. More
than oncc they turned back a deter-
mincd Saylcs Hall team in their bid
for a TD.

Men's vs. Humps ;

Scoring in three different quauw
lcrs. Mcn's countered on two passes
and a finc rim by scatterback. Jim
17.7.0.

Early in the opcning period, Men's
pui on a sustaincd drive which car-
ricd the ball to the Hump's twenty
yard line. From here Ron- Crochl
passed to Vic Mikovich for the
score. The li'y for point failed. Op-
crating from deep in their own
territory most of the first half, the
Iiumps \vcrc soon on the defensive
again on a pretty pass interception
by Dan D‘Angclo. 'I‘hrcc plays lat-
er. Dan scored on a seven yard run
:iftcr a pass from Crowell. The point
was good.

In the third period, Fred Curtis
and .liin 17.7.0 alternated on a series
of running plays to midfield. After
it short pitch to Curtis. Izzo swept
:il'ollllil cnd, after a fine block by
(icrry Knowles, and scnmpcred 35
yards to paydirt. The win can be at—
