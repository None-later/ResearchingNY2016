World University Service is the
direct descendant of a relief or-
ganization set up in Europe after
World War I. The work of its for-
ty-one National Committees is co-
ordinated on the international level
by the General Assembly with head-
quarters and permanent staff in
Geneva.

This year has been designated by
the United Nations as a year for
intensive emphasis on refugees ev-
erywhere. Among these refugees are
thousands of students many of
whom will need further loan aid to
complete their education.

Since 1956 more than 1000 Hun-
garian refugee students have been
welcomed to new opportunities to
study in American Colleges.

By LEE UPCRAFT

In the spring of 1957, our student
body deemed it necessary to change
the existing form of student gov-
ernment. From a constitutional con-
ventiton evolved a new concept of
the relationship of the executive,
legislative, and judicial branches of
our government. Since that time,
confusion has arisen, and two dif-
fcring philosophies have developed
as to the role of the judiciary in
relation to the legislature.

Literal interpretation

Some of our more overzealous
Senate doiniigogucs insist upon fol-
lowing a strict literal interpretation
of our constitution and desire to ex-
pose the traditional secret ways of
Myskania. Since no specific men-
tion is made of the traditions and
secrets of this body in our constitu-
tion, they would advocate overturn-
ing thirty years of tradition in the
name of strict constitutionality,
without regard to the effect on
school morale.
Radical Attitude

Just as radical is the attitude of

members of the present Myskania.
They conceive the role of the judici-
ary in the light of our old consti-
tution, which in effect made Mys-
kania the overseer and guardian of
the whole of student government.
They insist on perogatives which
have no place in a government bas-
ed on the equality of the three gov-
ernmental branches; perogatives
which are just as reactionary as
the concepts of student council and
compulsory convocations.

Special Committee

What is the answer to this vex-
ing problem? I propose the forma-
tion of a special committee compos—
ed of representatives of the Senate
and Myskaniii for the purpose of
making more clear the relationship
of the two bodies, as well as promo—
ting legislative-judicial cooperation
and understanding. Only when these
two bodies work together for the
benefit of the student body, instead
of personal agrandlsement, may our
student government be called tnin
representative.
