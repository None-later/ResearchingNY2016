Aesthetics . . .

This past week a local radio station listed in their top
ten tunes a selection called Danny Boy vocalized by Con-
way Twitty, another song entitled God Bless America by
Connie Francis, and a third tune called A Deck of Cards
sung by Wink Martindale.

Most of the Albany stations direct their attention to
the twelve to sixteen year age group (whether chronologi-
cal or emotional) and it shakes me as a potential molder
of youth to consider my competition.

I can’t believe that these blatant insults to taste are
the fault of the listening public. To a large extent the
Disc Jockeys and their picks of the week determine what
records will or will not succeed. We are forced to wonder
if the D.J.‘s are picked for their speaking ability and musi-
cal knowledge or their lack of consideration of any esthetic
values.

The above mentioned songs are only examples of the
present trend toward taking any song, whatever its beauty
or cultural, patriotic or religious significance and butcher—
ing it through the nasal grinding of some Ozark farmer
or the raucous bleats of an inept saxaphonist.

We can’t say that nothing is sacred to these people;
after all they do appreciate money.

If this trend continues we’ll soon be rewarded with
autographed pictures of Pope John or at least President
Eisenhower, for submitting slogans commending the vir-
tues of various stations (in two lines, they needn‘t rhyme).

Unfortunately all we can look for this coming Christ-
mas is fifty-thousand red blooded American youths learn-
ing to Bop to the wails of a highly jazzed up version of
Adeste Fidelis.

Ethics . . .

Charles Van Doren, former Columbia University Pro-
fessor, appears to be taking the brunt of the “persecution”
associated with the current TV quiz scandal. The press
and the public have suddenly focused all attention on him
for a “mistake” he shares with many others. Van Doren,
because of his professional position and respected family
name, has become the scapegoat.

Why haven’t other contestants as well as quiz show
producers been brought before the U. S. Senate? Others
have denied that they gave or received answers. but they
are lost in the glare thrown on Van Doren. What about
the clergyman, lawyer and Sunday school teacher who
have admitted they were coached on quiz programs? Why
are they not sharing the “unfortunate” persecution? Are
they any different? We don't believe it equitable that Van
Doren should be singled out and ruined for the rest of his
life because he succumbed to a temptation any of us might
consider inviting.

We don’t believe, either, that the entire television in-
dustry should be excused for allowing this horrible situa-
tion to happen under the guise of entertainment. Surely
someone in an ofﬁcial capacity knew what was going on
before the U. S. Senate began their investigation.

As Van Doren is a member of our future profession,
We must consider all aspects of this controvery before we
can make an honest appraisal of VanDoren‘s ‘morality“
or ethical philosophy.

Should Van Doi'cn be allowed to continue to teach?
We firmly believe belieVe that he should. Granted that a
teachers personal life effects the respect gchn to the teach-
ing profession, but we believe that academic capabilities are
of paramount importance in evaluating the worth of a
college professor in educating the American student. Van
Doren certainly possesses the highest of capabilities and
there is no apparent reason why he should not be allowed
to serve on a college faculty. College students should be
able to make discriminating judgments for themseIVes,
based on their own knowledge, pliilospliy, and ethical
standards.

We are aware of Van Dorcn‘s “mistake” and don’t
condone his action, btit in are saddened by the fact that
he is suffering all the persecution and becoming a martyr
for the whole situation. IS..I.B.

ers from nearby schools. Attend
