STATE COLLEGE NEWS FRIDAY. NOVEMBER 6.

Soccermen Favored to Take
Montclair at Bleecker Fray

Tomorrow afternoon at 2:00 the
Feds will take the field at Bleecker
Stadium for the final game of the
1959 season, meeting a Montclair,
New Jersey team that was beaten
in overtime at Montclair a year ago.

The Feds are favored to take the
game as Montclair brings a 0-7-1
record to Albany. If they do. it will
be the fourth victory in ten starts
for a team that had the talent all
season but just never could put
it together for a winning combin-
ation.

Last for Makely, Cox

This game will also mark the
last appearance of Seniors Don Ma-
kely. who has come a long way in
four seasons, and Dick Cox, whose
play in goal has been a surprise
for everybody this fall as the boy
from Homer made a tough job look
easy.

The fans owe it to themselves to
support this team tomorrow. While
there is no glossy record to point
to. there are players like Franz
Zwicklbauer. to whom the team
owes a great deal, and Karl Gers—
tenberger and Merle Miller: Sopho-
more Ron Cosliek, who played a
complete game Saturday after earn-
ing a sta.:ing role, has been one
of the most encouraging aspects
of the season.

Bridgeport ’l‘ilt All Wet

The story of the Bridgeport con-
test, won by the Knights. was one
of sloshing in the iiitid atid rain.
One of the wettest games in the
experience of this reporter, it was a
close battle led by the Feds at the

hall. Then unbeaten Bridgeport
smelled blood, let loose for a tour
goal barrage. and won their scy-

cntii game by a 4-1 score that \‘ii'-
tually clinched an NCAA bid for
the highly ranked eleven.

A great deal of the credit for a
great pci'loi‘iiiaiit‘c must go to all
unsung hero whose play and cf-
l'oi't have gone far beyond the call

With all that has been said about
this team, one point must be made
clear. This reporter owes the soc-
cer team an apology on one score-
they were NOT outplayed at 05-
wcgo in the ﬁrst half. While it would

is such a thing as a drive to win

The championship of the AMIA football league is still
not entirely decided as the grid season goes into its ﬁnal
week. Potter Club stretched its lead by winning its ﬁfth
straight game. besting previously unbeaten KB, 12-0. The
KB team. which lost another game to Sayles, now ﬁnds
itself leading a four-way race for second place.

Saylcs Hall pulled the most important upset of the
year. as this sixth place team dragged KB from their ﬁrm
hold on sccontl place. KB moved the ball well in the ﬁrst
two periods, culminating one long" drive with a touchdown
pass from Larry Breen to Joe Burton. The extra pomt
was missed. but the Blue and Gold held a 6-0 edge at the
end of the half. and the beginning of darkness.

The condition of the field was the worst it has been
all season. but the dark sky and “bcpuddled” ﬁeld did not.
