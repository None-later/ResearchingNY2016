The Facade

By DAVE FELDMAN

AN OPEN LETTER

To the Student Body:

The S.C. News wishes to announce
that the article placed under the
headline of “The Facade" with a by-
line by Dave Feldman. which ap-
peared in the Oct. 23 issue of this
paper, was neither “The Facade,
nor was it written by Mr. Feldman.

Through a mistake which was
neither the printers‘ nor any of the
Editors’, but which must be labeled
a quirk of fate, a different article
was inserted in the place of “The
Facade.”

Those of you who realized this
are to be congratulated on your
astuteness. Those others of you are
probably happy anyway.

Sincerely, etc.
DAVID E. FELDMAN
Feature Editor

A freshman btunped into me in
the halls the other day. Actually
aimed himself is more correct. “Why
Don't we got a Campus King? Huh,
Oh Wonderful One?" He asked.

Naturally I was appaled by his
abysmal ignorance and lack of
human courtesy.

State Prof
Prints Article

Robert Rienow. Professor of Polit-
ical Science. is the author of an arti-
cle entitled. "Why Spoil the Adiron—
dacks?", which was published in
last month's llarpers‘ Magazine.

Controversy over the highway
through the Adirondacks is the main
theme of the article.

Dr. Rieiiow who has been teach-
lll’ at Stutt- for 23 years interrupted
only by a three year period in the
service during World War II,
earned his AB. degree at Carthage
College in Illinois and his MA. and
PhD. at Columbia. During his stay
in the service. Rienow was stationed
in the South Pacific. He is now a
Colonel in the New York National
Guard and the Army Reserves.
Author of Nine Books

With the help of his wife as co-
author, Dr. Ricnow wrote a book
entitled Our New Life with the Atom
which came otit this yctii' and is
now in its second printing, He has
also written ('lillll. other books and
several iiitigtixiue articles.

Mrs. Ricnow spt-nds most of her
time writing t'lllitll‘t'll's books and

Ah well, I thought as I continued
to ignore him, what can one expect
in these times of darkness?

I continued on my way deftly
avoiding any further contacts with
wandering students. After all, one
such contact is quite enough to
ruin one’s day. A repetition would
be quite unspeakable.

Of a sudden I was struck by
the remarkable similarity of my
thoughts and those of that person
who had approached me. His
thoughts, I remarked to myself,
must have been inspired by some
intoxicant. Mine, however are pure
—thought that 

I mused over my idca for many
illuminating hours. In view of my
efforts, fellow students. I shall pre-
St'llt an idea of mine for your con—
sumption. (This altruism is posi-
tively heady!)

Let us have a Campus King! Yes,
fans, let us have it Campus King!
The ramifications of this idea are
so obvious that I will not belittle
your collective intelligence by delv-
ing into them.

Random Notes In Passing

To the girl who met me in the
peristle and told me that my arti—
cles (to paraphrase and even modify
a. little» are hardly worthy of her
careful scrutiny:

Keep up the good work in criti—
cism, and some day maybe you will
do reviews of Hcdricks acts.

To Susie Kolbrcnt-r iwliose letter

Thanks for the support, I really

Cave Dwellersl Initiates Season

William Saroyan’s The Cave Dwellers, the ﬁrst State College Theatre Production,
will be presented by the Dramatics and Art Council in Page Hall Auditorium tonight

and tomorrow at 8:30 pm.

The production is directed by James Leonard, Associate Professor of English,
with the assistance of Patricia Flynn ’61. Admission is by Student Tax or $1.25.

The play, a recent Broadway success, has a theme of love and survival which
is said to have evoked laughter and tears simultaneously. This highly theatrical and
unconventional comedy takes place on the stage of a cold, deserted theatre, where three
lost, old people live, patiently waiting to die. Five people wander into their world and
affect it in one way or another.

The original people on the stage are The Queen, a fallen star, played by Sue
Norton ’63; The King, who was once a great clown, played by Ralph Smith ’62; and
The Duke, 3. broken-down prize ﬁghter, by Martin Molson.
