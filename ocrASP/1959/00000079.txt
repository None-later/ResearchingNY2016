For the past ﬁve years the education department has
experimented w1th television for the use of classroom ob-

servation. In our estimation this program has been more
of a failure than a success. We appreciate the difﬁculties

that present themselves when there is only a limited
amount of room available for students to observe a realistic
classroom situation. We do not believe, however, that the
answer to this problem is the staging of a simulated class-
room over closed circuit television.

.The object of television observation is to present a
realistic classroom situation to a large number of students
so that they may see problems occurring which they will
be faced with later on. Unfortunately these classroom
Situations are hardly realistic.

The high school students go into the class knowing
that over a hundred people will be watching their every
move. The teacher goes into class with a very tight sched-
ule allownig only two or three minutes for the discussion
of a certain topic, and he is held tightly to that schedule.
Also technicians are. constantly running in and out of the
room, checking cameras, and every so often interrupting
the students, asking them to speak louder because the
microphones. are not picking up their voices. We consider
a_c'1ass of this type about as realistic as a full fledged tele-
v1s10n production, the only difference being that the actors
are amateurs instead of professionals.

Enough about the people being observed, now let’s
turn to the observers. There are many people who are
interested in the proceedings but they are far outnumbered
by. the dismterested. Graduates and Sophomores who are
being exposed to television observations for the first time,
keep the class in continuous laughter with their humor~
ous comments on the proceedings unfolding before them.
Juniors have been through this type of class before and
usually direct their attention to their badly neglected
homework.

- Are the observations worth the time and effort put
into them by the instructors? We sincerely believe that
these observations are a waste of time for everyone in-
volved.

R.C.G.

Campus Night

Thinking backto last Saturday’s festivities, we feel
there are some things that should be said concerning
Campus Queen and the skits.

First of all, even if we have to sell Dippikill to get some
money to buy a crown, let‘s do it. Those carnations would
have been charming in a vase, but not on the Queen’s head!

Also, with all the ceremony involved, fanfare included,
why wasn‘t there any connected with the presentation of
the Rivalry Cup? First the Queen had it, then the Presi—
dent oi' the Sophomore Class had it. How he got it we‘ll
never know. Magic, that‘s what it was!

As for the skitsthhey were great. The l'rosh did a
wonderful job however, the Sophs were superb. The Soph—
omore victory should, and can, be taken as a personal
triumph for their writr~r-producer-director, and for the en-
tire class.

What’s this? Spirit returns to State!

The Facade

By DAVE FELDMAN

We are faced with a great danger.
A danger of which very few of us

ill‘t‘ lthll‘L‘.
Who? What? What kind? Where?
you are undoubtedly asking. Yah,

what kind of danger? I’ll tell you.
Just. wait.

Well machines are one danger.
Machines are trying to take us over.
You know, soda and candy and all
the machines way up to the IBM
iiionsiers. But that's not the danger
that I mean.

Little urchins with runny noses
present another danger. They spread
germs and all sorts of terrible
things. Giye them tissues and put
them into their hands instead of the
bulls they grub. though. and you'll
take care of that danger.

The Russians and others of their
kliid arc ii danger. They are not as
bad as the danger that. I mean.

What? Who? you are thinking as
your coitce cup treiiibles not at. all,
is this danger? What is this grave
thing of which we should be afraid?

I‘ll tell you what. or who. Us!
'l‘hiit's what or who tAIlLl—(‘lllllllliC,
isii‘t 11,; U5 is. liil't‘l our greatest
(l.lll!'.t r. And I'll tell you why.

First of all. did you ever notice the.
expressions on most people's laces?
’lhey eithcr look like they are hav-
iiic a riotoust good time or they
look bored, The only in between is
when ihi-y chance the facial muscles
to mi or drink. it that. is not dan—
;‘,ci'~ii.~. thi ll nothing is.

And what do we laugh at when
we do. iii! h? We laugh at us. Either
us pi-isoiially, or other people. We
rarely lau. h at. anything more ab—
:sll'iil‘l or lill‘llli'l' iiwziy iroiii our-

ever concerned with much more than
us. Us here means us personally or
any group (club, bunch or kids. frat-
ernity or sorority. school. people
around the. card table, etc! with
which we are concerned, or with
whom we are sitting. at. the moment.
We are too selfish and group cen-
tered. Anything out of our spheres
of every day relationships does not
interest us. There are. of course.
rare exceptions to this. The bull ses—
sion and the infrequent semi—intel-
lectual discussion are cases in point.
But most. of us use such sessions
only to advance our own personali-
ties aiid to better our peer ii‘orgive
inc Ed. 131i relationships.

This is a real danger. As such it
has been mentioned by many others
besides myself. and at. this rate of
improvement it will continue to be
mentioned for quite :1 while. The
strange thing is that. by all reports.
this affliction is not confined to
State College, or college students. or
even to this country alone. One con-
solation is that now. State College
