Senate:

Subiects of Senate Debates;
Who's Who, Camp Dippikill

As soon as roll call was taken.
minutes were read and the agenda
was announced, Chuck Fowler, head
of the Senate sub—committee on
Camp Board, was called on to give
this committee's report. The com-
mittee recommended that Senate
close Camp Dippikill until further
notice with the exception of inspec—
tion parties authorized by the Sen-
ate Camp Board Committee. Fowler
listed his reasons for closing the
camp as follows: contaminated wa-
ter. the ﬁre hazards of the camp,
and. also that the camp does not
meet the requirements of the Board
of Health. Fowler also suggested
that representatives from the fac-
ulty, the Senate and from Camp
board be sent to close the camp this
weekend. Senator Grace Nesbitt
moved to accept these recommenda-
tions and the motion was passed.
Appointment

President Helwig then announced
the appointment of Grant Dufl‘ren
to fill the vacancy in the class of '61.

Jim Kelly asked Senate’s support
for Campus Chest and requested
that Senate sell Boosters for the
drive. Sue James then invited Sen-
ate to the Parent’s Day coffee hour.

Who‘s Who

Senate then discussed the election
bill for Who's Who, and decided
that there be no academic stipula-
tion to be nominated to Who‘s Who,
and also that the election be de-
clared invalid if twenty per cent of
the three upper classes did not vote.
Senate recessed for ten minutes,
returned, and closed their meeting
to nominate members of the Senior
class for Who‘s Who. When this was
ﬁnished, Helwig announced that
Senate could see The Cave Dwellers
on Thursday, and the meeting ad-
journed.

Cheer Contest

Monica Traskus, Editor of the
State College NeWs. wishes to an-
nounce that the contest which was
conducted by the State College News
in conjunction with the State Col-
lege Co—Op ended last Friday. The
contest has been declared invalid by
the Board.

Reasons

When the original notice for the
contest was released, the Board
stipulated that they would consider
the “attempt to arouse school spirit"
valid if and only if twenty-five en-
tries were received. Cheerleaders.
Board and staff members were not
allowed to compete.

Last Friday, the close of the con-
test, left the judges with just two
entries. It is unfortunate that this
had to happen. but to the two en-
trants. mention should be made that
their cheers have been given to the
cheerleaders and may be used.

Seniors Fling
While Pizza-ing

The “Senior Fling” welcoming
back first quarter off-campus stu-
dent teachers and sending off sec-
ond quarter teachers will be held
tonight at Cenci's Restaurant, start—
ing at 8:30 p.m. Pizza and other
refreshments will be scn'cd for the
price of $1.00.

Cliaperones for the evening will
include William Duinbleton, Assist-
ant Professor of English: R. Keith
Munsey, director of housing; and
David Treharne, director of Men's
Hall.

_ General chairman of the event
is Senior Vice-President Lee Up-
craft.

"They're rioting in Africa, they're
starving in Spain . . . The whole
world is festering with unhappy
souls (State College included, of
course).

Well, at least it's stopped rain-
ing. Now. I like rain; rain is nice;
it makes things grow. I’ve heard it
said that fewer people commit
suicide on rainy days than on sunny
days. Like I said, rain is nice—
but one can only take so much of
a good thing. and my dislike for
rain begins when the dampness
warps my guitar (I can no longer
sit in my corner and play “Oh
Lonesome Me") and my hair per-
petually looks like something that
has escaped from a horror movie
recommended by Sweet William and
lentlcman Jack.

Oh yes, horror movies! I adore
horror movies, but they're just not
making them like they used to. Ah
for the thrilling days of yesteryear,
when Bella Lugosi. Lon Chaney and
Boris Karloff were in their prime
of death; for the good ol’ days when
technicolor blood wasn‘t needed to
make women faint and children
cry, and when the tingles up and
down your spine were caused by
your imagination rather than by an
electrically charged theater seat.
People just don't have any imagina-
tion anymore.

Yes, imagination—that's what we
need. How about spraying the trees
in Washington Park purple and
gold, or pouring blue ink into the
lake so it looks like water instead
of pea soup, or maybe we could
hide Minerva in the third ﬂoor john.
The trouble around here is that
people just don‘t care.

They don't care if a dead rat is
a lot better than some of the live
ones. They don‘t care if we're the
only college of a. university system
in the entire United States that
has no rcprescntatution in Who’s
Who. The trouble around here is

that most people have no sensi- i
responsibility—and those who oi,
aren’t given the opportunity :o
exercise it. '

Those eager- beaver baseball
players are at it again-in another
football game. Here is what happen—
ed this time.

Joe Pozowicz had given speed
man Jerry Gilchrist good blocking
as the Fed second baseman raced
to the five yard line of the opposi-
tion.

Here Eric Kafka was bearingy
down on him, so Jerry lateraled to
Joe Burton. Bih‘ton was immedi-
ately downed by Jim Brown and the
ball squirted out of his hands,

Another defending man, Hank
Mans, tried for the ball but only

managed to knock it across the
goal line.
Neither man touched it as the

ball came to halt behind the line.
A tennis player recruited as :1 ref-

Spadd Situation

eree. Dave Baum, called the ball
dead.

Was it a touchdown or not? "No,"
says Mans, “It was knocked across
by a defending man!"

The attacking team was equally
sure it was a touchdown. Dave
Baum knew how rule on the play.

AMIA:

 

Potter Clinches AMIA Title;
KB and Humps Also Win

Potter - SLS

Last Sunday Potter Club clinched
the intramural football champion-
ship by edgiiig‘ Sis. 13—12 in one
of the most exciting contests of
the year. It looked as if it was going
to be a wide open game. as, on the
first play from scrimmage Don N0-
lan got off a 35 yard pass to Harry
Millet. who was tagged on the SL5
four yard line. Nolan tossed to
Eric Kafka on the next play for
the Club's first tally. Lu Call com-
pleted the extra point pass to Mil-
lct.

SLS retaliated later in the half
as Ed Vesnesky got off a 20 yard
pass to Pete Spina, who ran 15
yards to the end zone. The point at-
tempt was no good.

Excellent line play dominated the
the rest of this half. and further
scoring was prevented. EEP led 7-6
as the whistle blew.

The second half was almost a
rtpctitioii of the first, the game
continued to be the closest major
clash of the year. Potter again
scored first. on another loit': Nolan
l) Milch puss which Hurry carried
over the goal line from the 5. This
llllil‘ SLS stopped the Club's bid
for a conversion. As in the first
half. SLS soon moved back up the
with

field. cliniuxina their march
:i 13 yard pass from Vesnc-sky to
Spinu in the end zone. The Club

defense took hold to halt the all—
iinportan: cxiru point, and cite
Potter :1 13—12 victory.

The game was liiuhliuhtcd by the
csccllcnt blocking o1 SLS lincsmcn
Gary Lewis, Bob Vitzilc. and Stan

last period thrust to the Hump's 20.
The Goobers were at a definite dis-
advantage throughout, playing the
game with only eight men.

APA- KB

APA and KB closed out their sea-
sons oii Tuesday on a wind swept
field with KB winning '7 to 0. KB
scored in the first quarter on a
fourteen yard paSs play from Breen
to Henley. The extra point was
good. The rest of the game was a
seesaw battle with the ball moving
up and down the field freely.

APA almost scored late in the
second quarter when they moved
the ball from their own 15 to KB’s
10 but time run out. On this drive
Tillman and Pollaro were the stand—
outs catchingr pass after pass to
keep the drive moving.

Although the ball moved freely
up and down the field there was
some very good defense played.
standouts for KB were Mitchell,
Ellis, Gilbert. and Burton. Gus Till-
1111‘“. Dave Fcldman, Dan Huff and
John Pavelka stood out for APA.

KB almost scored in the fourth
quarter when one of Jim Dough-
crty punts was blocked by one of
his own men. Guess who that was—
yes it was the sports editor of this
paper who made the boo-boo. Oh
well. those things do happen.

Potter - Mens

Potter Club slipped by a spirited
Men‘s l-ioll team, 7-0, for its 7th
straight victory of the season. The
game on \Vcdnc:duy was even clo-
ser than the score, as the Dorm
tcum, definitely “up” for this big
one. gave it everything they had in
a losing cuusc. Mustcriiig a hard—
charging liiic and a very clcrt sec-
indary, Men's Hull, decisive undev-
dous before the game. held lllc Club
.L'i,l'L‘lL‘SS until the last quarter.

Potter certainly didn't look much
like the league champs, as notably
jiilll' blocking allowed many tags to
be made in their backfield, prevent-
ing any serious scoring threat in
the first half. Jim McNally, taking
over Men's passing chores for iii—
jurcd Ron Crowell, did a commend-
nble job of catching the Potter de-
fense a..lcep, but couldn't connect
on the big one. Men‘s running game
was excellent, with McNuiiiiy, pack—
ing the ball, ably assisted by the
IJlOL'kllltl ol‘ Vic Mikuvitt'li.

'lh" Club finally begun to look
nine in ihc lourlh period, and Har-
ry "the Hands" Millet [)Ullnd in a
13 yard pass from Don Nolan for
the solc touchdown of the after-
iioon. Lu Cull connected with Mil-
let in the end zone for the extra
point.
