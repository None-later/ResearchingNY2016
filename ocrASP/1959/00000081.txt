Soccer Team Ends Season
With Victory Over Monrclair

By DAVE MILLER

Albany State closed out the 1959
season, one of the wettest in its his-
tory, with a. win Saturday over
Montclair in a sloppy 2-1 contest
witnessed by about twenty frozen
fans.

When the shouting was over and
the players unfroze, the co-captains
and MVP were elected and prompt-
ly committed to utmost secrecy un-
til the soccer dance November 21.
Gerstenberger High

It was no secret, however, that
a Sophomore named Karl Gerstcn-
berger officially won the scoring
championship with a nine goal to-
tal second only to the all time high
of Frank Fallace set in 1958.

Gerstenberger, an Albany boy who
has won recognition in local sot-i-er
circles, scored in seven of the ten
games this season and twice ac-
counted for the margin of victory.

Fallace. hampered by a foot in-
jury from the season's first game.
scored only four times, while the
rest of State‘s goals were divided
between Art Hackett, who tallied
twice. and Sophs Ron Coslick and
Dave Colburn.

Colburn got credit for the goal
that ultimately proved to be the
winning margin as he booted in a
shot by Senior Don Makley to give
the Feds a 2-0 lead over Montclair.
Cox Loses Shutout

A shutout for goalie Dick Cox.
who was playing his final game.
evaded him in the last minute as an
unusual call by referee John Du-
mansky gave Montclair a penalty
shot that they made good in a tense
final minute.

The infrequent call came when
Cox was removed in favor of Bob
Warne who evidently had not been
recognized by Dilmansky as enter-
in; the game. A rule states that
the referee must be notified when
the gentile is changed.

It was 11 season of high hopes and
outstanding play for some people
and one of disappointment for oth-
ers. Bill Thompson anti Marty Bor-
ko did beautiful jobs in their posi-
tions; Franz Zwicklbuuer always
played outstanding ball: Dave Frank
and Chuck ReccsSo both deserve
credit for glossy play throughout the
season. Merle Miller also played a
strong game all season.

Y1‘t this team never clicked. As
the SHE-{111 wore on and the com-
11111.1111111 of injuries and bad weather
took their toll, the Feds seemed to
luck that (IllllilJlliliilOll that gave the

F‘rank Fallace, whose ankle injury
in the first game of the season cast
a gloom over the season and was
instrumental in cutting down his
production by ten goals—goals that
would have converted some of those
losses to wins.

In spite of this, however. the col-
orful star from Long Island drew
praise from all who watched him
during the season.

In many ways. it was a success-
ful season: For Bill Thompson. who
proved that he could hold his own
in three sports; for Franz Zwickl-
bauer. who effectively filled a big

gap left by Lou DclSignore: and for ‘

Marty Borko, whose leadership
meant a lot to a lot of people.

Dick Weaver. varsity manager
who took over at midseason under
tryingr cmditions. also gets credit
for performance beyond the Call of
duty in a valuable but often thank-
less task.

Maf Prospects

As I See It.

Porter Club
Reigns Again

By JOHN MODDER

Potter Club once again reigns over the AMIA Football
League. This year’s team went undefeated, mowing over
seven consecutive opponents. Potters Club’s stranglehold
on the AMIA league dates way back to 1947 when they
won their ﬁrst title by going undefeated. They repeated
as Champs in the '48 and ’49 seasons. In 1950 they lost
one game to the “ANGELS”, an independent team, and lost
the title. The Angels’ regime was short as Potter came
right back in ’51 to cop the title again. They held the title
until the ‘53 season when a power latent APA team took it
away from them. Next season they were back on top. In
1955 the “Hilltop”, an independent team made up of play-
ers like Bob Anderson, Rull Hall, Tony Kordizel, Mike
Flahive and Tom Sullivan who later became stars for EEP
and APA on the grid, beat them out for the title. From
that year on it's been all Potter. They have won the title
four consecutive times.

This year's team, coached from the sidelines by Owen
Davis (two time All Star last year, who is out with in-
juries), walked away from the league. Led by Don Nolan
who is by far the best QB in the league and his glue-
fingered catching end Ross Dailey, they set a record for the
most points scored in one season, 124. (This is under the
new rules of the league.)

Herm Altman, one of the two time All Stars on the
team picked both offensively and defensively, bolsters their
mighty line. All in all, there‘s just not too much you can
say about a team like this but that they are good.
