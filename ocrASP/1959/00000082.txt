Senate's Desire: the Biased FacultyioSpeak"

 

STATE COLLEGE NEWS.FRIDAY. NOVEMBER 13. 1959

Report of Their Boo Boo's

By THE CYNICS 0F PDR

Extra! Extra! Latest report on
the College Camp: By student sen-
ate vote, Dippikill (Biology Heaven
and Land of Trekking Senate In—
vestigators) will heretofore be closed
to students except for inspection
parties. Word of clarification: Stu-
dents may accompany the inspec-
tion party but cannot go there on
their own. Reasoning: Contaminat-
ed water, fire-trap farmhouse (no-
tice the alliteration) and various
other sundry hazards deemed too
trepldous for nature-lovers.

Parents’ Day announcement from
a Senator in front af the room: “If
you’re dressed up. come to the Par-
ents’ Day Coffee Hour.“ In the fu-
ture. all Senators will consult Vogue
and Mademoiselle.

At this point, the Senior Senator
wished to “tie up loose ends" and
asked if anyone wanted to go to
Camp this Saturday. Send yourself
to camp! Be AWARE!

After a necessaiy break to the
Union, Senate took up the “rush
order" of the evening—“Who's Who"
«Or is it, “What's What?) The magic
number is 31 again this year, so
get our your Paper-mates and vote!
What is Who’s Who? One Senator
thought it might be a money-mak—

ing scheme!!! because the book is

sold to parents of students duly
elected to it.

a—fraud! More on the “Rush Order
from the Dorm Field side of the
room. “Give the little man some rec-
ognition" (All candidates will be 5’
tall.) The old average question came
up and was voted down—Now every-
body’s happy!

Point of order: We Just noticed
the new, blue montage-like drapes
in the FDR—this year we're push-
ing American Homes and Gardens.

Senate proceeded to get very en—
tangled in just who could be nomin-
ated for next week's recognition
poll—tread lightly you accelerating
people. Do you know what class
you're in??? Various qualifications
that the voter should keep in mind
are: cheerfulncss. thriftiness, clean-
liness, and other Boy Scout criteria.

ClaSsic Comments emanating from
the PDR: “We seem to be missing a
couple of Senators every time we
vote.” “Don‘t scratch your nose or
your ears—just raise your hand.”

By KEVIN

Oh sing ye all the praises of the
Beat Generation, its art, its person-
ality, and its values!

The recent illumination of this
fascinating minority has had, no
doubt, an edlfying effect on those
who have come into contact with it,
as its few but blatant cultlsts here
at State wil testify. However, the
attention it has received has ob-
scured a far larger but inherently
less vehement minority which, to
an even greater extent, reflects the
trends of the times. This group, if
it can be called such, is si little rec-
ognized that it is yet unnamed. So
if there are no violent objections, I
shall now take it upon myself to
christcn it.

Oh sing ye all the praises of the
Sicknicks. A Sicknicks may differ in
types or severity, but their distin-
guishing characteristic is their re-

actions to their neurosis. Instead of
accepting his calmly and perhaps
blushing modestly when it occasion-
ly shows. like the rest of us do, the
Sickle is torn between outwardly
denying and inwardly relishing his
difference whereas the Beatnick is.
proud of his label, glories in it, and
flaunts his practiced scowl as a
badge of individuality, the Sickie
steadfastly denies to himself and
the world any deviation from the
norm. He is a devout supporter of
the wholesome commonplace NOR-
MAL way of life which he imitates
as wholeheartedly as he envies it.
For this reason he is difficult to spot.

A Sicknick may be posing as your
fraternity brother. your teacher, or
your date for this weekend. Yes,
therein lies another of the tragedies
so often witnessed at State—fresh-
men lstatusly or mentally or both),
imitating these stagnant. superfi—
cial Sicknicks. And jeepers. kids,
they're even worse than Littcrbugs.
