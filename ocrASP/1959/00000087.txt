STATE COLLEGE NEWS FRIDAY. DECEMBER 4.

1959

 

By the By-stander

The Dippikill Camp Committee is
making with the 01‘ college “Rah!”
as the Senators troop from dorm to
dorm seeking answers to their prob-
lems with the “Land of the Frozen
North”. Will State join the USNSA?
The initials stand for United States
National Student Assoc, and not
the local temperance unit as you
might have suspected. Senate ap-
propriated $90 out of Surplus twhcre
else?! at the request of J. B. Healy.
Purpose: buses for the Childrens'
Christmas Party sponsored by SUB.
Foreign X-change: State Fair per-
sonnel hashing over the idea of
sending a State student abroad

after money is allotted to bring
a foreign student here. Point of

Information: Senator Fowler's ac—
quaintances in the SPO t"Pat" and
“Angie”! will receive thank-yous

for typing the Directory. Rumor:
SC News sent a delegate to an un-
approved conference? — and "s h o t
their line" by $40?? Shame on you!
Also Rumored: SC News “has money
to burn." Where's the smoke? Will
Senate send a mlssive to News
Board informing it of the former’s
AWARENESS of what is going
on?

The SA Veep is deeply concerned
over “Prices from Proskin," the
NEWS photog taking the place of
the now-defunct Photo Service. ?
of the Week: "Why won‘t Weaver
let his people take pics?" tRhythin-
ical sentence, isn't it?) . . . And now
reader-at-large, what is your atti-
tude toward government” Come,
now. extricate yourself from the
woodwork and ask yourself this
question: Am I being truly REPRE-

“Swdaaa'al 8W”  -

SENTED by my Senators? Do I
know just how judicial MYSKANIA
is? What about CABINET? In an
endeavor to eventually “tighten up"
the SA constitution and have a bet-
ter clarification of the powers that
be, the Senior Senators started a
mch that the Big Three get to—
gether for a summit conference
(over refreshments at Brubacher).
Maybe there will be less nebulous-
n c s s? ——M o r e together - n e s 5?"
Classical comments in the PDR: . . .
 . . .And then there was this little
girl from a mining town in the West
who said: ‘Isn‘t this the committee
for the Physics Club‘s constitu—
tion?"'—ah, spelled sideways that’s
Nature's. “Battaly wants his
name in the paper so here goes . . .
“Actually. we have a problem—and
that‘s an tniderstatement."

We took advantage of a balmy
Thanksgiving vacation to get in
some late-season bird watching.
Luck was with us, and we got the
oppportunity to view some rather
rare species. Limited space will not
allow mention of all we saw, bitt
here are a few: a broad bellied
back-slapper. a tartan topped tap-
tipper, a bleary eyed brandy—buyer,
an ossified rum—sot, and a broad-
beamed stool-stealer.

from losing personal belongings to

By JOHN

Is someone out to kill the only
spectator sport on campus. It's a
known fact that basketball draws
more people than all the others
combined. Who scheduled Sorority
Formal Dinners and the first home
game of the season on the same
date? Crazy man, what. a way to
start. the season off. This school is
spirit lacking now. why rtiin it for-
ever.

Coach Sauers and his ballplayers
have spent a lot of long hours of
practice in preparation for this
game, to present you with a team
that you can be proud of. Yet liaif
of the school will miss this first bitt-
tle because of the great scheduling.
The only thing I can say to the per-
son who is responsible is “Great
play Shakespeare."

AMIA News Roundup

Merle Miller, President of AMIA,
announces that intramural basket-
ball aiid bowling will get under way
next week. Commissioners for bas-
ketball are Dave Frank and Barry
Jameson. Connnissionei's for bowling
are Bill Shufelt and Karl Herman.

Merle tells me it‘s the greatest
with 30 teams signed up for basket-
turnout ever for intriunural sports

Diamond Men
Look Forward

In response to more requests for
information about the baseball club
at State——tlie one that might go all
the way next spring we have
rounded up some more information
for you.

Jerry Gilchrist, who had to stop
signing autographs after being mob-
bed in the commons. will still ac-
commodate any who desire this
favor. His keystone partner, short-
stop Joe Barton, has had to stop
distributing locks of his hair until
he replenishes the supply.

Ray "aver, co-eaptain along with
Dick Lewis, both aspiring to better
their 300-plus averages, are making
a New Year's resolution—“aver will
never steal home while Lewis is
batting so Dick can win the. RBI
title.

Mrs. Egclston. State‘s number one
baseball fan as well as an assistant
professor of history. wil lautograph
the ball she throws otit an opening
day for some lucky sptctator.

Hank Mans has a new, improved
pitch so fabulous even he can't dc-
scribc it.

not go out and bet your whole yard
