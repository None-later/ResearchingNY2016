Civil Service Offers New
Opportunities for Scientists

The Civil Service Commission an-
nounces that it is searching for
qualified scientists in the fields of
chemistry, mathematics, metallurgy,
and physics for research work in
various Federal establishments in
the Washington, D. C. area.

Those appointed will work with
some of the nation's foremost sci-
entists in promising assignments.
They will have opportunities for ad-
vancement. The entrance salaries
range from $4,490 to $12,770 a. year.

Most appointments are made to
the following agencies: National
Bureau of Standards, Departments
of the Air Force, Agricultural Re—
search Service. and the National In-
stitute of Health. The research lab—
oratories in these agencies have the
basic and applied research done
which is diversified and affords
many challenges in the field of phy-
sical science.

Governrvent service offers oppor-
tunities to research scientists of all
levels to pursue careers with ad-
vancement determined by compet-
ence and stature as a scientist rath—

er than by administrative position.
The major emphasis of the labora-
tories is research, and investigators
participate to a large extent in the
shaping of the programs that are
undertaken.

The results of research done by
scientists in the Government service
are published freely except when
national security is involved. The
Washington Academy of Sciences
and its affiliated societies provide
a wide range and variety of meetings
which give one an opportunity for
acquaintance with other scientists
in one's own or other fields.
Requirements

Candidates must have completed
appropriate college study leading to
a bachelor's degree. In addition for
positions paying $5,430 and above,
graduate study or professional ex-
perience is required. Specific re-
quirements are designated for each
of the salary levels plus the usual
citizenship and are requirements.

Further information regarding
these positions is contained in Civil
Service Announcements 209B and
210B.

 

ﬁf/m’u 6/ State

By ELAINE ROMATOWSKI

If half of the students in this
school look as if they're gaining
weight, don‘t worry. they’re prob-
ably not. Most likely they all have
mono-nucleosis and their glands are
swollen. Yes, this is the season for
contracting all sorts of diseases, and
it seems as if “mono” is first in
line for the second year in a row.
Two years ago, you had to have the
Asian Flu to be a conformist, but
now it seems as if the general con-
ct-nsus is that "mono" has all other
diseases beat by a mile.

For you students who may not as
yet have been acquainted with this
affliction. allow me to explain. It
all begins with a cold-——that is, you
think it's a Cold, but when you visit
the M.D.. you are happily informed
that your uncasy feeling is actually
the beuinnings of that ulti‘ii-collc~
u‘izite discasc known as "mono-nu-
cleisis.” Of course, you think this is
vcry inicrcsting and exciting, be-
cause cycryonc else on your corridor
icons to how had it already and
you \u-rc ii-iginning to feel like an
outsider.

let-.t. you find that your glands
arr- beginning to stroll. l"or a sec-
oiid. you think that it may be due
to the iact Lilli, you v.alkcd to the
Central 'l‘.iycrn in the rain last Pri-
day, but alter considering the prob-
h-m more ("n-cpl); you find it much
nrirc cxcitmg to attribute thc mal-
iun taming of your body to lill' c.-
li-r-h. ol the illiicr’s rather than t»
your own stupidity.

night from B to 12 pm.

So you write home and tell your
mother you hate college (you have
three papers due on December 11),
you don't like the type of students
we have here (you “decided” not to
join a Greek organization), and
you're horribly sick (we went
through that before). Mother writes
back and says to hold on until
Christmas vacation and she’ll see
what she can do.

You‘re in college now; you have to
learn how to overcome these fits of
depression! Stop going to the doc-
tor's, buy an economy size bottle of
aspirin. get used to black coffee,
learn to type faster, get a paper
i‘r im someone who's taken the course
the year before, and remember that
most people are basically good (al—
though it is too bad that some of
them arc so base). Second semester,
after the blizzards stop and the sun
remembers that there is such a place
as Albany, things should look con-
siderably brighter. Then after three
years or so, you'll probably still feel
tic same, but at least you’ll have
bccomc too used to it to quit.
