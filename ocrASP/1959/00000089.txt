Wednesday Evenlng Session
Reveals: Senate Goofs Too!

By PAT LaBALBO

Senate commenced with some
plagiarized jokes from Shelley Ber-
man material. On the serious side,
impeachment proceedings are in
inotlon against Senator Robert
Bat't‘aly. The grounds for the im-
peachment motion are three un-
excused absences.

It was revealed that Senate de-
clined u) send a representative to
a conference at Skidmore College
rrahh for the purpose of discussingr
African problems. Are they pre-
judiced?

One. of the next orders of busi-
ness was to assign left-ou't Senators
to committees so that they wouldn't
feel left out. “Let them have some
tools to tinker with." rBerman joke.)

On the matter of "punishing" the
News for transferring money with-
out the coiisent of Senate we have
the following quotes:

"We have been a weak body too
long." “Shall We slap their hands
with a ruler and tell them they
musn‘t do it again?“ “They are
gonna crab," said the biggest crab
as she strapped her claws.

Big Expose

This is top s .‘el rof coursci but
just, to even tne score, we'll tell that
Senate also took money that was
not specifically accounted for in the
budget, Guess what foi'——‘t‘o send
siglitseers to Dippikill. Who's got

"money to burn?" Are they “stand-
trig,r on a weak leg?”
Rise Stevens

“What do you mean by an out-
standing figure?" Finally a motion
was made to remove tickets reser-
ved for the public from sale. They
will be given to Sta't‘e College stu-
dents on the same basis as the
others were. Why does an incident
like this happen? We are entitled
to all the seats in Page at an event
such as this sliice we have already
paid for them through the Student
tax. Miislc Council exists for us and
not for the other Albany residents.
Music Council is not in a position
to augment its budget by selling our
seats. Senate‘s action on this mat-
ter is commendable, but somewhat
belated. Well, that‘s the end 01'
scalping, friends.
Goodies for the Senators

Senate approved a motion to
have “rcfreslnnents of some type"
at the. next meeting. That's not iii-
cluded in the budget either.
Thinker of the Week Award

It was hard to find a candidate,
but 'l‘ony D'Onofrlo gets it . . . he
was the only Senator who was
awake and only slightly confused.
Question of the Week

“Shall we have a Soto Fervice?"
