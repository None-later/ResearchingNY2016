Sauersmen Meet Harpur and
Cortland in Weekend Trip

By DAN LABEILLE

The Albany State eagers will meet
strong opposition in tonight's tilt
with Harpur at the latter's court.
Harpur, who defeated RPI last week
in a 47-46 upset, is believed to have
produced a topnotch team this year.
Denny Johnson, who injured his
knee earlier this season, will move
into the starting lineup tonight along
with Sherwin Bowen, second high
scorer in last week's game.

Tomorrow night, the Sauersmen
will conclude their weekend trip as
they face Cortland State Teachers,
last year's tournament champions.
The Red Dragons will feature Angelo
Condi, who has been averaging 26
points a game. at the starting guard
position.

Peds Powder Pace

The Sauersmen started the season
on the right foot last Saturday by
defeating Pace College of Brooklyn,
88-77. High man for the night was
Don Cohen, netting 35 points; Sher-
win Bowen seconded with 19. The
Feds tallied 34 for 93 and copped

Ma’rmen Prep
For RPI Meet

Varsity and freshman wrestling
under the direction of coaches Joe
Garcia and Bob Burlingame will
make their home debut tomorrow
when the Feds take on RPI at
the Page gym in a 2:00 match.

For the Feds this will mark the
second start of the young season and
will mark the first appearance of
several on the Albany mat.

llui’i’, Biolsi Hurt

This year’s team sports a weird
concoction of old and new with all
shades in between. From Dave
Pause, the only wrestler with high
school experience, the Peds’ talent
lineup ranges through two other re-
turning lettemien, and two retum—
ing second stringers, to a trio of
newcomers. It may not have all
eight men, in fact, as Dan Huff
and Lou Biolsi were admitted to the
crutch and cast club tth week and
may not see action.

At least the Feds started out the
season with a record under their
belt'v—the most injuries in a season
as they managed to send no less
than twelve off the mat in one way
or aiiothei'--aiid as a. result took the

Yet the conditions that would

“For the experience they have
had," remarked the mat mentor. “we
did as Well as possible. I was proud
of this team and the way they

Coach Sauers stated that the team
looked sloppy due to the nervousness
of the inexperienced Sophomores but
that the game was definitely not an
indication of their ability. The Peds‘
main concern right now lies in the
field of rebounding. Sauers stated,
“Don is the only boy I have, that’s
been getting up into the air; I wish
Wallace would try jumping a little
higher."

Next Week's Slate

Tuesday night the Feds will travel
to meet a powerful Oneonta team.
Oneonta upset Oswego. 77-69, in last
week's tilt. They have height and
veteran ballplayers.

AMIA:

SLS, APA, Cuts
In Hoop Victory

A schedule of four games kicked
off this year‘s AMIA intramural
hoop program. A three-game-a-
night schedule will continue
throughout the winter.

SLS Nips Spooks

SLS started the current campaign
with a nip and tuck victory over the
Spooks. At the end of regulation
time, the score was knotth at 41
all. SLS won out in overtime to gar-
ner a 5:3 to 51 victory, SLS's Pete
Spinii took game honors with 21
markers. Barry Jamason added 10
for the winners. Gary and Doug
Pcnfieid netted 16 points apiece for
the Spooks. Pete Rogers threw in
15 to support the Penfields.

AI’A ‘Team’ Wins

APA easily beat the Losers. 43 to
30. rThere was no outstanding player
for the victors, as it was a team
victory all the way. Everyone played
great bull and that is about all you
can say about the victory.

The Losers kept pace with APA for
a hull", but ran out of gas in the
second half. High men for APA
were John Modder with 1'], Bob Pol-
lcro with 10 and Ray Eddy with 6.
Toni ltraii paced the Ikisers With 14
markers.

i From the Sports Desk

Thinking out loud: There are a
flock of high scores in the gym pro-
gram for freshmen, but no walls are
bursting from overcrowding in the
wrestling room. The fresh could use
help in addition to A1 Markowitz
and Steve Ward, who came out this
week.

ONE OF those wrestling casualties
was the basketball team's gain as
Dale Wescott of Peru, N. Y.. took
over the head manager's job.
