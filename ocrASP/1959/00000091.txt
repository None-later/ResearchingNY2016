ALBANY. NEW YORK FRIDAY. JANUARY 8. 1960

State Peds Face Siena Indians
In Annual Baffle Tomorrow

By DAN LABIELLE

For the foru'th consecutive year.
State's varsity basketball squad
will play Siena College tomorrow
night at the Washington Avenue
Armory. This contest is expected
to draw more Albany area basket-
ball enthusiasts than any other
game played in the Tri~City area
this year. The preliminary contest
between State’s Freshmen and
Siena‘s JV will begin at 6:30 pm.
Background

The series bettveen the two
schools began in 1939. In the 1939-
40 season Siena nipped the pre-war
Peds by seven points in the initial
encounter. 52—45. In the following
season the Londonville Indians
emerged victorious in two meetings,
winning one game by three points
and llllllltE the. third game of the
series by the wide margin 62-27.
Due to the Second World War, the
series did not resume till 1946. The
Pcds still suffered defeat. In 1957
the Pcds lost 75-66 in what proved

to be the most exciting game of the
season. Since then, the traditional
rivalry has made this game the
main attraction of the year in State
sports.

In the 1958 season the Purple
and Gold scalped the Indians 66-42.

Last season State lost to Siena
by a narrow margin, the decidingr
factor being field goals.

Statesmen at 5-4

The Feds now stand at a 5-4
record having lost to Utica Tues-
day night 65-61. According to the
Ped mentor, “This game should be
a toss-up. I have a lot of respect
for Dan Culina and his boys but
if we can play as well tomorrow
as we (lid two weeks ago in New
Jersey we have a very good chance
of winning. I don't think Siena is
as good as Oneonta or Cortland
and had we played decently we
would have won those two games."

The boudonville Indians now
have a 1-7 record. Dan Cuhna is
not certain of the outcome of the
game. Albany’s recent win in the
NAAIA Christmas tournament. has
darkened his hopes.

(‘asey Hurt

The absence of Rog Casey, due
to a charity horse in the hip, will
hinder the team offcnsivcly and
defensively. The Delmar product
has seconded Cohen in shooting
and rebounding this season.

The. Starters

Starting at center for the Indians
will be John Smith, leading rc-
boundcr. Flanking him on the for-
ward liiic will be Pat Martoiie and
John Legassc. At the guard posi-
tion Siena boasts Gary Smith. ion
scorer of the season averaging iiinc
points per game, and Joe Henley.

Denny Johnson, Don Cohen,
Sherwin Bowen. Jim Grcciic will
be starting for the Feds. The fifth
man. if Casey is still not able to
play has not yet been picked.

Coach Suuers has stated that he
does not consider this game to be
of special importance. Hc regards
this as a rcgular game and he plans
on playing it as such. The Feds
