To the Editor:

Perhaps you feel relieved and

job comes to an end. Everyone
knows that the Editor of the
NEWS contributes much time
and effort in fulfilling his posi-
tion.

The staff which has worked
with you during the past year
appreciates all you have done
for us, the NEWS and most im-
portant the entire school.

You can feel proud of the job
you have done.

Thanks, Monica, for every—

thing.
Barbara Libous

Amen....

“If I am nominated, I will not run; if I am elected, I
will not serve" as editor of this paper for another week! It
has been interesting, disillusioning, nerve racking, and at
times rewarding. But times goes on and this is the last
issue I‘m responsible for, and you know what, I'm glad.
After three and one half years of being in the News of-
fice on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday nights, I'll now
have a chance to see what college students normally do
on those nights.

The office has been left to a capable staff which with
the support and cooperation of the student body can turn
out a very good paper. It is very important for everyone
to realize that putting out the paper is not a job which
only affects the staff, but everyone who wants to have
news in it.

44-45 . ..

Barbara—

Welcome to the ranks of editors of the STATE COL-
LEGE NEWS! You may not fully realize yet just how far
you’ve stuck your neck out. From now until next January
you can’t stop fighting—fighting to put out a paper, to
put out a good paper, to make the paper respected, honest,
and sincere.

You’ve got to begin to look at State College as an out-
sider does, but with an insider‘s devotion. When you're
most discouraged, and there’s no one to help you, remem—
ber you have forty-four former editors watching you and
indirectly helping you.

Don‘t let No. 46 down, and don't lose sight of what
the News stands for. Yours is the most important position
in the school—~stand up to it.

E. A. S.

FROM US TO YOU

It has been said. and somewhat wisely. that all good things must
end. It is with this thought that. we write our last column. It's been fun
and informative; at least —t'or us Believe it or not. sometimes your con-
fusion was not greater than our own. A Word of advice to future Com-
mon—Stntcrs: Sparing the rod will not spoil the child, but might en.
courage the child to do some good. It was this thought that guided us;
we knocked where it was necessary but not often enough to be mean.
Souhail and farewell.

As Y()l' KNOW

We dont like: The posit-rs m the peristyles, in case you haven't
gotten the clue before; the substandard size of Page hall, stage, and
gym; the ion: trek to an anti-climatic camp; the relative inactivity of

Press Bureau; used (Il(.‘\\'lllL‘, gain in the drinking fountains: student
lack of interest ll! fund-raising events; administrative control over
cocktaiinis; the improvised and inimversehed Co-op swrcroommnzmiely,

REMEDIAI. LIVING

We would like: The above dislikes remedied; a. good-Torch Night
skit; heated but. sensible campaigning in the forthcoming elections; Mys—
kania l'(‘('t)lllll'lt‘li(llitltills for nominees they would like to see elected to
their group; more publicity for honoraries; commencement exercises in
front of Page rather than in back of Brii; a new school mascot—or a
gigantic campaign building up the prestige of our present penguin; IFG
to schedule Marty, Roman Holiday, and A streetcar Named Desire; more
all-school formals to be held first semester.

ICVEN'I‘UALLY

We prophesy: That the student body will have increased to skirt/cy-
eight or at least umptyniue within the next year; professor's salaries
will approach 2:3.(i0tl—- not dollars, of course; the campus will move to
a camptthite; bridge will edge out all major sports on campus, and a
certain coach will receive a different type of trophy—a grand slam;
illness will reach an all—time high next semester.

WHY 5401‘ WE ’l‘()()

l)cn.i‘ Deans: Correct us if we're wrong. but it seems to us that due to
a lack of mid—.seniestei' break lust year, there was an unusual amount of
student-illness. Althouin we l‘t‘t‘ilLilll/if‘ it, as educationally unsound, at

The Facade

principal part of a building. 2. the

front part of anything ta facade of

wealth; a facade of happiness).
Rhymes with bits—nod iwtthout the
N of course).

It may not be exactly according to
Webster, but the above definition
should do for those of you who may

have wondered from time to time

during the past year.

he had a good time. It has been
fun trying to show yo tr flubs and
your fallacies to you. It has been
interesting watching you in the
Union, the Commons and cafeteria,
at soccer games, in the bars and at
your parties. It has really been sort
of a year long class cf Ed 21 in
people. The observation reports
came out on Friday and their pur-
pose was to show you what is be-
hind your facades.

If I have ever had any subjects,
they have been all of you and your
facades. You are really nice people.

have tried to show this to you. If 1
have not succeeded, that is too bad.
If I have, at any rate, :umiscd you,
then at least one of my purposes
has been attained.

I think t rat you are. afraid, and
that is why you have developed this
m-isk, this facade. You are afraid
to be or act yourselves. But i think
that you are less afraid than most
pcoplc. Somehow State College is it
real mother to most of us, even
tliouxh we are rarely aware of it.
We are nestled here, l’ii'in Ill the
sccui'ity of hci' protection. lit-cause
of this you get less and less undid

ever used this knowledge to know
yourselves -— which is perhaps the
greatcst knowledge. Some of you
have, but most have stopped, trem-
bling, at the brink of discovery;
both scared of what you see, and
too intelhx-tually lazy to go further
anyway. So rather than learning
about yourselves, you have created
yourselves. You have created from
your knowledge a mask and a part
for yourselves to use. It is not your
own, but it is your refuge and your
security. It is your facade.

i feel that my attempts to tell you
this have generally been either mis—
interpreted, or misunderstood. But
I knew that the battle was lost from
the start. People do not ordinarily
want to lOok at themrclves, and
they want less to have other people
look and tell what they see.

I only hope that I may have made
you aware of your own facades. My
loudest wish is that I may have dent
them a little. At any rate, I've had
a lot of fun hacking at them.

Do not worry, I’m not leaving.
This is only my first fond farewell.
But this is the lust ‘Facade'won
