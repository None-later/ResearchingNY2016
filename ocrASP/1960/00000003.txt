Peds Cop Christmas Tourney from Pace, ersey Teams

By Dave Miller

An Albany team that wouldn‘t
give up finally cracked its tourna-
ment jinx to win the championship
of the District 31 NAIA Christmas
invitational at Asbury Park last
week by beating Glassboro State in
a double overtime thriller decided
in the final minute.

The Pre-New Year's Tourney, in-
volving six New Jersey teams. Pace,
and Albany State. was the first for
the district but will probably be re—
peated annually. It was a semi-

past years with the presence of
Jack Weaver.

the Armory tomorrow nigh’t' — See
you there.

Utica Upsets State

Tuesday night. the Sauersmen
lost to the Utica Tangerincs in a
close 65-61 fray. The loss was due
to an extremely unexpected poor
first half on the Albany side. The
halftime buzzer revealed a 37-23
score. in favor of Utica. The Feds
went into a full court press and
with five minutes remaining in the
game. the score was 59-59. Utica
forged ahead in an initial effort
to win the game.

elimination affair in which first
night losers were eliminated and
second night losers played off for
consolation honors.

State Over Jersey City

State's first night effort. an 82-08
triumph over Jersey City. was paced
by Don Cohen's 28 points via 10
field goals and 8 free throws. Rog
Casey was second high with 20.

The Pods keynoted their poten-
tient foul line attack (netting. in
the tournament. :1 total of 72 of 89
attempts) by winning this one from
the free throw line after being out-
shot from the field State employed
a zone defense. earning a four point
lead at the half, before switching
to a man-to-man for a while sec-
ond half. The Feds reverted to a
zone late in the game.

Paterson State. meanwhile. was
stage for the semi-final contest on
the second night. Putting a zone to
work for what coach Dick Sailors
called “one of our best defensive
games." Albany owned a three point
halftime lead and went on to a 69~
5:3 victory paced by the shooting of
Sherwin Bowen and Rog Casey who
netted 20 and 17 respectively.

Free Throws Make Difference

Tllt' Pcds had a prolific night at
the charity linc, netting 21 of 20
tries including a stringr of 1:") con-
secutive successes, for 83'.“ while
hitting on 38’; of the field tosses.
Don Cohen. who had to settle for
14 points for the night. had a per—
fect night as did Casey. and Bowen
hit in 8 of t) trics from the. line.

The win sci up the final the
following night with (‘tlassboro. who
had beaten Pace. providing the op-
position. Some hint of what was to
come may have been offered when
Pace. in the prclunimu'y to the
final. won its consolation game on a
last sccond frcc throw; but it proved
anticliniactic to what will rank as

one of the all time thrillers in State
basketball. This was the kind of
game fans describe years later to
their grandchildren.

It all started out when the lead
changed hands four times. the last
time putting Albany ahead only to
blow a fivc point lead to tie the
regulation gumc at 71-71 and send
the contest into overtime.

.‘vlassboro opened the cycrtime
scoring and kept a two point edge
as the teams traded scores until
the final minute when Sherwin
Bowen took the two free throws
that made history -»—- and sank them
both to deadlock the first overtime
at 79 points apiece.

ITATE COLLEGE NEWS FRIDAY. JANUARY 8.

Grapplers Face CW. Post;
Freshmen to Meet Oneonra

By DAVE MILLER

Hard-hit wrestling. suffering from
a manpower shortage unequalled in
its history. will take over Page gym
at 2:00 Saturday when the varsity
and fresh tangle with C. W. Post in
their fourth start of the season.

Down to seven men after Paul
Turse was dropped from the squad,
the Feds will be looking for their
first win of the season. They lost
to a poworful Winona team that
placed three men in the top five
brackets in the Wilkes-Barre-Tmu‘-
ney; they had been beaten by Cort—
land and RPI in previous matches.

This gives some idea of the type
of opposition the Peds have had to
face: a Winoa team whose heavy-
weight won the championship at
Wilkes-Barre, and whose 155 pound-
er and 115 pound man were both in
the top five.

Added to this formidable task.
the man who Winona‘s heavyweight,
beat out came from Osweg‘o. anoth—
er of State's opponents.

Albany will go into matches like
this trailing by five before the first
man steps on the mat.

The Pcds were shut out for the
second time this season by Winona.
which gained six pins. a forfeit. and
a decision to give State a real taste
of midwestern wrestling

Dave Pause was the lone Pcd not
to be pinned as he held his 137
pound advisary to a decision with
some brilliant wrestling.

The varsity lineup for the (‘. W.
Post match will go something like
this: Dan Huff in 12:}. Jay Katzcl
at 130. I’ause at 137. Loun Biolsi at
147. Dick O'(‘onner at 157, Ken Jew-
ett at [67, and Tom Ellis at Heavy-
weight.

All of these boys have been work-
ing hard and deserve your support
at Saturday‘s match. This will be no
team that will walk off with honors.
for it is a rebuilding team; but still
can jell to give the kind of perfor-
mance that is worthy of State l'ans'
support.

As I See It)

Football at" State

By JOHN MODDER

 

FOOTBALL AT STATE—There has been a lot of talk
floating around the halls of State as well as in some of
the best pubs in Albany about football. Do you realize that
there will never be a football team at State until the stu-
dents of this college voice their opinions on whether they
want one or not? The Athletic Director of this college can't
go into the President's Office and tell him we want foot-
ball. He would be laughed out of the office because he
hasn't got the authority to want football. It‘s up to the
students of this college to get together and go to the Ath-
letic Director and tell him we want football. With this
backing he can then go in and fight for us. Let's have less
talk and action.

If you haVc read this article this far you are probably
saying to yourself—all good and well, I want a football
team but who are we going to play. where are we gomg
to play and won‘t we get murdered in the first few seasons.

State could set up a three year plan whereby equip—
ment could be bought to equip four intramural teams. Af—
ter the season is half over an All-Star team could be picked
to scrimmage Union and RPI to gain the confidence that
they would need for a good ball club. The second year the
team could scrimagc Union and RPI plus play home
and away games with Buffalo and Oswcgo State Teachers
who are also contemplating football. The third year we
would be ready for a full fledged schedule which would in-
clude Brockport. lthara and New Haven State Teachers.

The team could practice on Vet's Field and could dress
and shower in the rcd brick building on the field if it were
enlarged another two rooms. The home games could be
played at Blocker on Hawkins Stadium.

All people who want football; BOY OR GIRL. please
contact me by student mail or my word of mouth so that
we "an get the ball rolling. IT’S UP TO YOU.
