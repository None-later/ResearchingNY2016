Sauersmen Travel South; to Meet Pratt,
Brooklyn Polytechnic in Weekend Tour

By JOHN MODDER

The Cardinals from Plattsburg nipped the Fed‘s where it. hurts the most (scoring
points) and went on to win 81-76. They put the game on ice inthe ﬁrst two minutes
as they raced to a 8-0 lead. Malan opened the scoring With a driving lay up, ‘Fessette
scored on a jump shot and Jack Potter the (Cards ace) dropped in four moieﬂpomts
on beautifully executed driving lay ups, Coach Sauers called time out at this time to
regroup his charges but the 8 point lead by the Cardinals proved to be the deceiding
margin at the game’s end. If the Peds could have played .the ﬁrst two minutes as
they did the last 38, they could have bagged themselves a Victory.

GAME STANDOUTS

The player award of the game has to go to Jack Potter of Plattsburg as he play-I
ed a real heads up game and was the backbone of the Cards team. He put them out
in the lead in the ﬁrst two minutes of play and kept them
there with his excellent play making.

The Card's Fessette and Florin also took turns stab-
bing us in the back with their play. It was Fessette in the
ﬁrst half scoring 15 points to keep his team in the lead
and Florin in the second half who tok over the scoring
punch to enable his team to maintain the lead. Both of
them killed us off the boards as they grabbed 50 of their
teams 60 rebounds.

There was no outstanding player for State as the the
team played a good ball game but just didn’t have the
added polish the Cards did. Cohen
played his usually good game scor-
ing 17 points and taking his share at,
of rebounds.

Wallace, Casey and Bowen played
good defensrve games. if there has
to be an outstanding player for the
Ped team i would have to choose
from three men~~Spicc1, DZlktiWiClZ
and Green. Spicci and DYilktm‘lt'l/

and Brooklyn Poly. On Friday, a:
7:30 they meet Pratt at the 2nd
Regimental Armory. The next night
at 8:30 they mret Brooklyn Poly
at the Brooklyn YMCA.

Coach Saucrs is very concerned
about the lack of 't'eam play in the
recent games. “Everybody's been
trying, but everyone has been try-
ing to win it by himself rather than
making a unified team effort. Ile
attributed this fact to overeagcr-
ness and inexperience which has
been a steady plague all year.

Sunday afternoon Kappa Beta
defeated the Goobers, a slumping
team, by a score of 58-47. Great
fight and a fine team effort was
shown by the men of KB who were
underdogs from the beginning.
Another contributing factor in the

victory was the terrific shooting
percentage from the field by the
winners.

After a tremendous first half,

KB started off slow in the second
half, but soon caught fire and went
on to victory.

KB was paced by Bob Sands with
iii points and Jerry Mitchel with 14.
John Ruth turned in another Lin—
pressive performance with 23 points
