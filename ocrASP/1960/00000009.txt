Committee Work

I am in favor of more effective
use of Senate sub-committees. By
having the committees do much of
the discussion that takes place an
the Senate floor. much time can be
saved.

Improvement Communications

I would like to see each group
house and dormitory receive min-
utes and agendas of Senate and
Cabinet meetings This would help
to improve the comrnunications
problem here at State.

Medical Improvement

I would also like to see the Sen-
ate Service Committee investigate
carefully the possibilities of improv-

ing the medical facilities on our
campus
Presidential Support

In clasing. I \\'()lll(l like to add

that. it: matter which of the three
Presidential candidates is elected. I
will do my utmost to give htrn the
support and help that he needs.

crnnicnt.

Specific .-\ims
Representation

It is my feeling that the present
system of representation to Senate
is not the most effective method to
be had. It Senate is to represent a
true majority of the college's stu-
dents. I firmly belivc that a system
coiiipo.«e(l ot' a combination of
group house and tat-large represent-
ation iron) the classes should be
employed in our government.

('ullurc

There is a definite need on this
campus for increased activity in
the field of culture. If we are to
liicl) pacc with other colleges and
universities in this country, we
must provide a greater opportunity
for all students in the area of cul-
tltl‘al enjoyment.
Stutient-I'aclilty Cooperation

I propose an active Strident-
I"aculiv Committee composed of in-
formed students. faculty members
and administrators of the college.
This committee would study and
discuss those problems which are
dirrc'ly under the jurisdiction of
the luct‘lty and iulministration.

Senate
Sweepings

By the Janitor

So many people at Senate Wed-
nesday nitel We thought we'd come
into (by mistake of course) one of
the local "Sally" soup kitchens.
When coffee and doughnuts weren’t
forthcoming we came to the reali-
zation that a Senate meeting was in
progress. Seems there were lots of
aspiring Senators in attendance.

And before we go any further let
it be known that the word apathy
shall be stricken from the vocabu-
lary of the “Janitor”. There was in

7 attendance at the meeting a per-

son ( and a Soph at that!) who was
not (gasp!) a candidate in the
forthcoming election.

Sue James continually outwlttcd
everyone with h or humorous
"boners". First of all. the question
came up whether or not. freshruari
class meetings of the Rivalry period
should be made compulsory. Then
the word compulsory was hasth
over several times and it was finally
decided to leave it in, on several
stipulations.

The usual bit. about name tags.
beanies. fun (1 ys. etc. was okayed.
penalties for infractions would be
inforced by the court.

Sections a.b.2: .2!). continued to
confuse the senators bill. Sue James
came up with the solutionw an as—
terisk! decided: next y'ar it
will be the duty of "fresh" coun-
selors to familiarize their groups
with traditions of State College . . .
Then came the hall of inquiries cori-
cerntng. just “what are traditions?".
Again Sue 'aine through with the
statement; and We "quote". “You
can‘t legislate ()n tradition" .
brilliant. deduction . anyway. it
was passed 20 to 2. whatever that
means.

It was also decided that each class
must publish a newspaper every
week during the Rivalry period . . .
judged on journalistic and now
literary accomplishments. (Incident-
ally, both papers must surpaSs the
efforts of this year’s Soph paper.
Note: no criticism of the “frosh”
gazette.)

Miscellaneous funds were proposed
for ropes. etc., for Rivalry . . . also,
the Pedagogue only went $300 over
their budget score $220.99 in
transferrable funds for the worthy
organization.

Next week: Fowler makes recom-
mendations on January to January
elections. Lots of luck.

seems to have hardened into a big
black cannonball. becoming the shot

State College. I hadn’t realized that
the age of martyrs and masochists
was still very much alive. but the

tians seem like amateurs. The milk
has been spilt and wiped up. so why
does the child insist on crying?

Yes. "pcttincss" sems to have re-
placed “apathy” (whoops! I've said
it again) as the basic philosophy of
one or two rather disorganized ar-
gz‘.ni:l.atians on 'ampus. It’s comfort-
ing. however, to note the hand-
writing on the walls. 'IH‘ue. it isn‘t

ever-present cycle and back to the
first paragraph.

Pardon Me

If I'm being a bit too nasty to-
day, you must excuse me. Who can
be nice when even the elements are
at their foulest. I'm getting a little
tired of troddlng through the seem-
ingly sewerless streets of Albany,
silently damning the Department of
Public Works. I‘ve often wondered
why Albany was built on- a. hill.
Now I knoy'mso that all the filth
could run downhill towards the river.
I guess it does. in many ways.

Seriously. Now

Since I have to take up about six
more lines of space. I may as well
break down and say something
worthwhile like “Get out. and vote!
The school you save may be our
own!“
