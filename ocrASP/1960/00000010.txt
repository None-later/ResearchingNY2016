Peds Battle Suffolk UnlverSIl'y, Oswego  Spying Sports _ .

At Page in Crucial eekend Contests

Albany State's hoopsters, facing
a tough weekend schedule, take on
Suffolk University tonight and pow-
erhouse Oswego tomorrow as the
home season heads into the final
stretch.

Suffolk is a new team on the
Albany court scene. meeting the
Feds after taking on Siena last
night on the Indians‘ court.

The Oswego tilt should be an
old story to Ped fans. who are used
to seeing hard-fought Oswego-Al-
bany scraps. An SRO crowd is ex~
pected for the important contest.
which will feature the long-awaited
clash between Don Cohen of State
and Ron Davis of Oswego.

Davis, Cohen Equal

Davis. matching Cohen's 6-foot-5
inch height, is currently bucketing
25 points per game. Cohen is scor-
ing at a 19.3 point clip. and hauling
down 18 rebounds.

The Feds will be out to win this
one. A win tomorrow night will be
a big factor in insuring the Feds
of a first devision berth at the
State University tourney at Cort-
land. but coach Dick Sauers has
made it clear that such a win won't
be easy.

“We'll need our best efforts of
the season. both offensively and de-
fensively," declared Sauers. “to beat
this team tomorrow night."

The Peds lost to Oswego twice last
season, once in regular season play
and again in the tourney. Davis
was the main thorn in the Peds'
side. scoring 33 in the tournament
and 31 in the regular tilt.

Height Advantage

The Lakers will have the height
advantage in the game tomorrow
night. The contest will also mark
the annual Knick News Polio Fund
drive at State — the college con-
tribution to a city-wide drive of
Knick News sport editor Charley
Young's instigation — and set the
stage for the Feds home finale with
New Britain Wednesday night.

Oswego Comes into the game with
a win over highly regarded Platts-
burgh under its belt. but having lost
to Oneonta early in the season.

The rooty - toot - toots and the rummy - tum - tums ‘ I
that echoed through Page gym the other night sort of
made our purple and gold duet look rather sick! I could - '
ask “Why can‘t we have a band like Oneonta’s?” but that ‘ ,
question would only be answered with hems and haws as r
would the question “Why can’t our basketball team get I ‘

new uniforms?”

Yes I do know that we do have a band (or at least
that‘s what some people call it) but the only time they’re
put out on display is at homecoming — and even then,
their mis-steps and mistakes make us wonder what the

“Will the Pogos be bigger and better?” Well, a casual ‘  '

Best Title Race Ever Seen in League:
Goobers, Spooks, SLS Move Forward

(loo hers Smash Potter:

By GARY l’ENFIELD

The Goobers A. C. remained in contention in the first league by defeating an under-
manned Potter team 55-37. Don Nolan led a well balanced Goober attack with 14
points while Pat Shields and Chuck Pegan added 12 apiece. Playing with only four men,
Potter stayed Close for the ﬁrst half and trailed only by ﬁve points, 21-16, at intermis-

sion.

The Goobers. taking advantage of an occasional freshman, ran away from the Club
in the Second half as John Rath and Earl Shiner joined the attack and cleared both
back-boards. Lynn Western took individual scoring honors with 17 and, along with
Bill Hernkind. battled for rebounds. Ray Haver. scoring on long one handers. added 12
points in the losing cause. Aggressive Lou Lucidi played an outstanding floor game
for the Goobers before fouling out late in the game. The Goobers now sport a 3 wins

2 loss record.

Potter Sweeps Second League:

Last week the second league title was taken by a
strong, well-balanced EEP team. EEP ﬁnished the season
undefeated by rolling over the entire league with the ex-
ception of the Spartans whom they subsequently subdued

by one point.

The Club was led by the uncanny shooting of its high-
scoring backcourt trio of Captain Pete Barbagclata, Tito

Guglielmone and Chuck Recesso.

Pete “Tiger” Savarie

could always be counted upon to clear the boards or gain
possession of the ball through his scrappy aggressive play.
The playmaking chores were more than adequately handled

by clever, quick-witted Ross Dailey.

Another factor in

EEP‘s league romp was the dependability of its powerful
bench strength consisting of Tony “Soft Set“ Diinperio.
Bob Warn and Chuck Sloger.

Spooks Stomp KB:

Led by lioug and (i:ii‘)' l‘cnlicld,

on the season while the Spooks
chalked up their third win against
two losses.

When Albany State‘s wrestlers
invade Teaneck. N. J. tomorrow.
for a match with Farleigh Dickin-
son University, they will be looking
for their second triumph within a
week.

They captured their first last
Saturday night by defeating Brook-
lyn YMCA. in a match highlighted
by excellent wrestling.

Albany's 137 pound Jay Katzel
and Highland Mills product Dick
O'Connor both earned quick pins
to pace the 20-18 win. and Tom El-
lis. a Gloversvillc boy, made an im—
pressive showing in an exhibition
match when he gained a decision
over his heavyweight opponent.
Ellis usually wrestles 177 pounds.

Wednesday. the Pcds dropped
their fifth match of the season by
a 29-3 score. Albany's 123 pound
i.ou Biolsi, by winning the first de-
cision of the meet as be defeated
Dartmouth's Mike Duffy in a hard
fought match, showed up as one
of the most improved wrestlers of
the year. He is from Waiitagh. Long
island.

Dartmouth dominated the rest of

the meet despite the fine perfor-
mances by Kati/.0], Dave Pause.
O'Connor. Paul ’furse. and Ellis.

Freshmen Art Brunelle and Clayton
lilavsks came through in fine style
in exhibition matches.

lc‘rosh Prospects

()n the freshman scene. John
Woytowich and Ted Dusanenko
have been drawing praise from var-
sity coach Joe Garcia for their re-
cent performances.

Garcia expects to use Woytowich
to bolster his lllill squad H7 pound
Woyiowich. who will be a great held
to the varsity, is a capable and
hardworking athlete as is shown
by his freshman soccer achieve-

ments. Although he had no high
school experience. he has tallied
goals against tough competition.
As a wrestler. he has improved
tremendously and after losing a
match at Cortland by one point,
has beaten grapplers from RPI,
CW Post. Oneonta. and 0000 to
accumulate a total of 19 points.

lusanenko. freshman heavy-
weight who trails Woyt'owich by 1
point, will be valuable varsity ma-
terial if he develops to the fullest
potential. having the perfect phy-
sical and mental equipment re-
quired for becoming a. good wrest-
ler.

Varsity grappling at State ts now
in its fifth year of operation. The
sport, on a club basis for several
years. achieved varsity status in the
1955-56 season when in an eight
meet season they gained a 5-3 rec-
old,

In 1956~57. the grapplch enjoyed
a banner year with Tom Farrell
leading them to a 7-2-1 record with
a perfect season. The one tie was
with Oswego.

llill. Kane Lead Peds

1957-58 saw the Feds without
Farrell, but Joe Hill stepped into
fill the gap in the 123 pound brac-
et and Charlie Kane remained un-
beaten in the 1:37 pound class. The
final record was 7-3. That was the
season of Bob Bosomworth and
Wayne Harvey, and destined to be
the last of the great seasons for
a while.

The 1958-59 season proved to be
a slow one for the Peds. who wound
up on the short end of a 2-6 record.

19:39-60 is a rebuilding year with
promise of better days to come as
from coach Bob Burlingame pre-
pares his charges for varsity coin-
petition.
