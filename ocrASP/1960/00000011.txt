Mexican Film
On Tuesday

The International Film Group
will present a Mexican film. “This
Strange Passion" in Draper 349 at
7:30 pm. Thursday.

This Strange Passion is in Span-
ish dialogue with English sub-
titles. It stars Arturo de Cordova

of special interest to Spanish stu-
dents and in addition will provide
excellent film fare for all.
