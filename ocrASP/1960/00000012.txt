Precedence

The jurisdiction of MYSKANIA now appears to be a
well deﬁned fact. The past week has woven together con-
stitutional intent and an actual precedent setting decision
resulting in almost unlimited power for MYSKANIA to
judicate in all areas of student interest.

MYSKANIA’S trial involving Inter-Fraternity Coun-
cil and Sigma Lambda Sigma fraternity brought to the
surface the judicial body’s actual power, that being to act
as a court of Appeals and try cases of unusual nature.

It is the in.ent of the Student Association Constitution
to govern all students whether it be individually or as
group members. Therefore no group is able to operate
outside of Student Association.

Inter-Fraternity Council, however, implies in its Con-
stitution that their representatives shall be the sole inter-
preters of said Constitution. This implication was lost
when IFC allowed themselves to be placed in the position
of defendant in the trial concerning the legality and justice
of their decision relating to the removal of Sigma Lambda
Sigma‘s right to issue bids.

This IFC case set precedent for judicating those or-
ganizations which previously considered themselves apart
from the jurisdiction of Student Government and MYS—
KANIA. It now appears that all organizations (including
ISC and Residence Council) are constitutionally obligated
to submit themselves to the Authority and Judicial Power
of Student Government.

United We Stand

In light of the recent controversy over the decision of
Inter-Fraternity Council to withhold the bids of Sigma
Lambda Sigma, we have devoted a great deal of time to
the question of whether fraternities and sororities are an
asset or a liability to any college campus. This controversy
did not start this question but only brought it into focus
as far as State College is concerned.

We have watched freshmen limit their loyalties from
a group of 2300 people down to a group of 60 people by
doing nothing more than signing their name to a piece
of paper.

Why should we force any person either male or female
to drop friendships overnight and force them into new
friendships? Why should we force these people to devote
so much time to a group of sixty people that there is no
time left for activities that would beneﬁt the entire school?
Why should people be turned into hypocrites with no more
intentions than smearing the name of another group? This
last question goes under the mild name of rushing and is
considered a necessary evil of fraternity life. This in itself
is true but we do not believe that fraternities are a neces-
sary evil of college life.

On a large campus with a great many national fra-
ternities and sororities, these groups may have some value
to students (although parochial schools, military academics
and other universities such as Harvard seem to get along
very well without them). On a small campus such as ours.
a fraternity is not needed to help a freshman find his
social group (In the contrary. any person who needs a
fraternity or sorority for social reasons on this campus
should never have come to college in the first place.

In the IFC controversy we were ashamed to see college
students suddcndly drawing into tight groups and prepar-
ing to ﬁght if necessary in order to defend the honor of
their supposedly different types of groups Are these groups
really different? We don't think so. Since these groups
(both sororities and fraternities) are not so very different,
why is it necessary to cut our unity in college so that We
can preserve these groups A house divided against itself. . ..

Hamilton
Visits College

By JIM DOUGIIERTY

Since his installation as President
of the State University. Thomas
Hale Hamilton has been moving rap-
idly across the “checkerboard” situ-
ated university.

Monday afternoon Hamilton made
his forty-first move and landed on
the 5-acre campus of Albany State.
President Hamilton has six more
moves to make to finish his “game”
of visiting each of the 47 units and
visiting with their respective facul-
ties and student leaders.

Albany Expansion

"Expansion of facilities on the
present site here in Albany is a dif-
ficult problem," states Hamilton.
"because the maximum campus size -
would oiin amount to 25 acres. A
month ago the Campus Site on up-
per Washington Avenue was ruled
out. but one more alternative is still
under study. A definite decision is
due possibly within a mouth."

It seems that the entire situation
has taken too long and that imme-
diate action must be taken to meet
the projected needs of this college.
State Reputation

Concerning the “reputation” of
this educational institution, Presi-
dent Hamilton states that this col-
lege "has one of the best reputa-
tions for teaclicis' colleges of any
other institution of its kind in the
United States."

Quoting Education Commissioner
Allen, Hamilton says, "Albany is as
high in quality as any liberal arts
college you will find."

Change In Certification

A recent report drafted by the
Education Department concerned
the over-hauling of the State teach-
er certification requirements. It
suggested that rather than being
certified in two fields as at. present.

students would specialize in only
one field.
Hamilton says. "If we went in

this direction, we couldn't staff the
schools. In view of this question,
the iiiliior pi‘iillzllily won't be drop—
petl."

in answer to .i oiiery relating to
a. possible .i-yciir education, Hamil-
ton states. "(.irowth and the continu-
ing shortage of teachers almost
rules out. any chance that we will
increase to it 5-year program. The
University is trying to do the best
possible job in four,"

. ,,

Listen, my children. and you
shall hear of the woes befalllng a
college career . . We are here.
brethren. in this fair facet of the
State University, to become “all
we are capable of being ” Is every-
one letting you bccome all that you
are capable of being? Do you know
of how much you are capable? Are
you becoming?

Questions plague the weary soul
in the dark of night. when the
typewriter is hidden and the last
grand slam is tallied. It is in no
way incongruous that ilie inspira-
tion for these questions comes from
it dii‘t‘y sweatshirt! “Let each be-
come all he is capable of being."

But just. how much Is "all"? Does
it mean all "A's." does it mean
Myskania, does it mean both or
does it mean social probation? And
\‘.'liut about "capable"? Is it up to
the administration or up to our-
selves io determine the extent oi
our own capabilities?

.‘Coiiictlliic:. the thought occurs
that. "iiII‘ we are capable of being
is not oiuie enough to adjust to
this world of ours. We are gracious-
ly given four years in which to de-
termine whether or not our capa-
bilities are sufficient. Some of us
show great talent towards becoming
boolurorms while others beat the
Leer-stained path to alcoholism.
"Li-i each become all he is capable
of being." Why not!

The wheels that run this colleg-
iate machine of ours. and the tools
that prod the wheels. are well on
their way to becoming capable.
’l‘hese are the students who put
out a newspaper. weild gavels. vote
"aye" and "nay," and develop no
hobbies with which to while away
their leisure hours because they
have no leisure hours. These are
the pen clods who spread them—
selves thin. iii an attempt to realize

their “all.” These are the students
who. when they think of gradua-
tion, feel that i’hey will be leaving
behind them an institution which
they had helped to build.

So go home and wash that dirty
sweatshirt! Take a good look at
that now out-da’t‘ed and probably
faded purple and golden circle, and
ask yourself if you’re “becoming.”
Maybe you should have tried out
for that play; maybe you should
have gone to the cub reporter meet—
ing; maybe you should have run
for class Vice President. You’ve
come to college to get more than
a BA. or BS, or at least you
shoud have. "All" means more than
Dean's List. "Let each become. all
that he is capable of being"!
