Albany State will be looking for its sixth consecutive victory tonight when the up-
set-minded Peds make the treck to New Paltz and their season~ending contest there.

Win number ﬁve came at the expense of a high flying New Britain team, them-
selves tourney minded. and avenged a loss at the hands of the Blue Devils a year ago.

Marking the last appearance of captain Denny Johnson, the game was sparked by
outstanding performances by both him and teammate Don Cohen.

The Peds led by only one point with ﬁve minutes of play remaining when Johnson
came off the bench and held the team together with some ﬁne ball—handling and key

hoops.

plays host to a powerful Oswego
wrestling team in its annual con-
tribution to the Knickerbocker News
Polio benefit drive.

The Peds have made a vast im-
provement since the beginning of
the season and this meet promises
to be the best of the. year.

Lose to FDU

Last Saturday State dropped a
narrow decision to Fairleigh Dickin-
son by a 20-18 score at FDU. iii a
thriller that was not decided until
the final minute of action.

Eircball 130 pounder Jay Katzcl
and 137 pound Dave Pause both
earned quick pins to put Albany in
the lead.

157 pound Dick O'Connor wrestled
a tremendous match but was pinned
late in the third period.

In the 167 pound class. Paul Turse
won a decision in a hard fought
match. forcing Fairleigh Dickinson
to win the next matches to earn
its iinhill victory.

Fresh Draw

The varsity heartbreaker was pre-
cccded by a freshman scrap that
wound up a 19-19 draw that fea-
iui'cd consecutive pins by Albany's
Art Bruncll. John Woytowich and
Clay Hawks. The trio. pacemakers
of the underdog Peds. will be in ac-
iioii tomorrow afternoon in match
competition.

Briinell required almost the full
time for his pin. gaining his five
poinicr at 11:20 to break a 4-4 dead—
lock iii the 137 pound division.

Woytowich handled FDU's Ken
Borup in 3:40. whilc Hawks wasted
no time in disposing of Joli Raphy
in 2:10.

IJ‘DU pulled abreast of the Peds
by winning the next two matches.
the equalizer coming when Ted Dus-
anenko was pinncd at the seven
minute mark.

Home Finale

The Oswceo contest tomorrow not
only marks the Annual Polio Fund
wrestling match but the end of the
winter sports season for varsity
competition in Page gym.

Basketball ended Wednesday and
this event is the final home mect
for the Peds. who have come
through with flying colors in what
must be regarded as a rebuilding
year.

State has had the banner seasons
before and they will come again.
it should be rcinembcrcd however
that the support the Peds get to-
day will huvc a great deal to say
about what they do tomorrow.

Fans at State are just as eager
as at other colleges if they get the
chance to show it. They only need
the push to get them to the events.
They have every reason to be on
hand tomorrow — to show that they
can. and want. to support wrestling
as a varsity sport at State.

That extia plisli iii a winning
icain is there largely because the
fans put it there with their support.
Every fan at State owes it to him-
self and to this team to be on hand
tomorrow afternoon.

Men‘s Sweep Two Games:

Men‘s Hall continued in their winning ways last week
by soundly defeating The Spooks and APA behind the ﬁne
ballplaying of Jerry Blair and Chuck Hunter.

The ﬁrst victory against the Spooks enabled Men’s to
assure themselves of at least a tie for the league crown.
The game was nip and tuck throughout the ﬁrst half with
both teams playing an excellent shooting game. Early in
the second half Men's turned on the steam and took a 10
point lead with eight minutes left in the game. A ﬁnal
rally by the Spooks during the closing minutes closed the

3 gap to one point with only seconds remaining but Blair

sank three foul shots to set the score at 52-48.

In their last out Men's whipped APA 60—44 for their
fifth victory in six starts. Chuck Hunter and Jerry Blair
again led the way as Men’s opened a 35-18 gap at halftime.

Merle Miller led his club back to within five points of
the lead during the second half, but Dave Janick and his
patented one-handei‘ put the game on ice.

Loser’s Win Two:

The Loser’s. currently rated as the best team in the
AMIA ﬁrst league. extended their winning streak to three
games by beating KB behind the fantastic scoring of Jim
Oppedisano. The much shorter KB team could not stop
Oppedisano. who scored 30 points on long jump shots and
frequent tap-ins. Jim also controlled both backboards for
