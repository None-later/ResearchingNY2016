('abinet

I Because of a renewed enthusiasm
ior Myskania, the three presiden-
tial candidates did not name the
members of their respective cab-
inets. The Junior class, apparently
remembering the prestige of Mys-
kania in their freshman year-gas
a rule, preferred to run for that
oiiice rather than to serve on Cab-
inet. The trend last year was one of
a SlII‘lllill' nature, however, the 58—59
year involved competition for cab-
inet posts.

Secretary

The appointment to Secretary 01'
Student Association has not been
made. Last year the appointment
was made in the Junior class, how—
ever this is not a precedent that
must be i'oilowed as a freshman
appointment was made by Presi-
dciii Yagcr in 58—59.
