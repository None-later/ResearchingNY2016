We Believe

As students of State University, College of Education
at Albany, we are proud of our academic traditional, and
social standards. It is the privilege and duty of each of
us to uphold and further these ideals.

We realize that at all times we are representatives of
SUCE in the eyes of friends and community, and that our
every action is a reﬂection of ourselves and our school.
We wil always bear in mind that an educated person
exempliﬁes his school and himself by his conduct.

The future honor and growth of our college are de-
pendent upon each of us. and only by maintaining our
own dignity and self-respect as individuals may we hOpe
to perpetuate the high ideals of everyone of us. The stand-
ards we hold now will not be lost with graduation. but will
continue to enrich our lives.

Code of Honor as drawn up and presented to the Stu-
dent Association by MYSKANIA, 1959—60 on Inauguration
Day, February 20, 1960 to become a written part of the

tradition of the College.
MYSKANIA, 1959-60

Does “are to” Mean Will?

The February 12 issue of the Colonial News from Har-
pur College contained a “Policy Statement from the Dean
of Students" which is to be placed in that college's future
handbooks. The purpose of the statement seemed to be to
provide an interpretation of student conduct at Harpur.

“1. Respect for People and Regulations—Harpur stu-
dents are to show common courtesy and respect of one
human bein gfor another to all college officials, faculty,
and employees . . .

2. Honesty—Harpur students are to be honest in both
spoken and written word in all dealings with the college. . .

3. Conduct in I’uhlic—Harpur students are to govern
their public conduct by a respect for the rights of others
and for the accepted standards and mores of our society.
(A public display of affection between the sexes is often
offensive to others.)

4. Drinking—Intoxication is not acceptable.

5. Gambling~Gambling in any form on college prop-
erty is not permitted.

6. Vandalism—Students are to respect the property of
the college and that of others. "

Honorable student conduct, we think, is not something
that can be dictated by an administration. nor does com-
pliance with Harpur‘s "code" make for correct student con-
duct. A node of honor is not a set of rules consisting of
dos and don'ts, but rather an expression of spirit and ideals
that must come from within the student himself.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 26. 1960

 

Chunumuanéaaddnni

To the Editor:

 

I wish to submit a criticism of
your presumably sincere editorial
of last week which concerned frat-
ernities and sororities on the campus
of State College.

First of all. students are not forced
to drop old friends when they pledge
a fraternity. Pledging a fraternity
means that. in addition to the many
friends outside the Greeks or in
other houses. the student will develop
a much more intimate brotherly
friendship with his fellow students
than is possible without the ties
that a fraternity fosters. Old friends
can be. and are. nialntaiiicd by the
members of fraternal organmiiions.
As a pledge and as a future brother
I will not drop my old friends. but
I will think just as highly of them
whether they are pledged to any
house or are independents. I am
sure that many pledges of any irat—
ernity on campus will agree with
me.

Secondly, members of fraternities
and sororities are not deprived of
time for other college activities. By
examining past records land this
week's election resultsi we know
that many class officers. Senators.
Myskania members. State College
Newsinan. basketball players, etc.
have been or are. active fraternity
or sorority members.

As for the statement, about
“smearing” during rushing. 1 am
completely puzzled. While I was

rushing a fraternity I made no un-
befltting or dlsci'editing remarks
about another house. and I was not
aware that I was expected to do so
ias you iinplicatedi.

Fraternities and sororities ari-
definitely needed on a campus of
State's size. Before coming to State
I was a student on a campus of sini—
ilar size but Greeks are illegal
there. The result is that there is
no school spirit. no healthy rivalry.
few close friendships, etc, etc.

The separate groups do not cut
the unity of the student, body-»—the
clean rivalry is actually a unifying
force. Why have separate (",reck
letter organizations? Indeed!!! Why
have separate political parties in the
United States: why have separate
states and nations?

I am proud to wear the colors of
my fraternity and I look forward
to life-long friendships with each
and every pledge and brother

Respectfully siibiinitcd.
Allan Still'leiir ’61

To the Editor:

ltecently a representatiye of the
News sought my reaction to the
publicized State report that. iipi-rior
students withdraw iroiii teacher—

sult that "teaching abet. incdio-
