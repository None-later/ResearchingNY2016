STATE COLLEGE NEWS FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 26. 1960

 

AM a; state

By RHODA LEVIN

It might seem a little silly to con-
duct an autopsy on elections, but
there are those who get neglected
after the hecticity of Inauguration
Day. Those people are the losers. It
is to the candidates who were un-
successful in their campaign that
this column is addressed.

We do not always think that those
who have been elected are especr-
ally worthy or capable. We cannot
deny. however. that they are popu-
iar. It is interesting that in this
school. which is intelligent in so
many other ways. there are so 'very
many deserving people who fail to
win an election.

They are good sports. They con-
gratulate the winners amidst tears
of happiness for the successful. and
tears of disappointment for. them-
selves. This is natural. and it LS to
be desired; for once these losers
get over the impact of their per-
sonal defeat. it is they who pitch in
and work for their school. Someone
who is greatly disappointed because
he did not get an office is someone
who loves his school. That person
just doesn't give up.

It is true that to the loser. things
sometimes seem so futile. You work
and plod. forsaking your personal
dignity and popularity by always
being there when you are needed.
And what do you get for '1” Gen-
erally. nothing. Not an office. not a
word of thanks. It is extremely easy
to become somewhat of a cynic—

rather. it is too easy to become ein-
bittered. Will it seem foolish if I
say to you, “Dont”?

“Do.” however. try your best to
get back into the swing of things.
The first step you have to take in
this immediate period of rehabili-
tation (for it isi, is to ask yourself
why you lost the election. You would
not be running. rranted, if you your-
self did not feel that you had the
qualifications. So we may eliminate
that possibility. You might have had
the necessary qualities, but how
many people knew this? Did you
work to the best of your abilities
when you should have?

Another big factor is: how many
of the voters knew your iiitmc'.’ It
sounds hollow to be idealistic. but
sometimes those innumerable “bc~
hind-tlie-secnes workers" who have
helped this school in countless ways.
are simply not knowu to the voters.
It is not their fault.

The final-«and most impin'tiintW
element in elections of the past two
years seems to be: did the fresh
know you? i iinaintain, although
the fresh will disagree, that they
are not capable of voting prudently
in all—school campaigns.

1 have purposely shied away from
mentioning personalities. There are
many people I have in mind, how-
ever. to whom this column should
be meaningful. You will not be
forgotten now that the ballots have
been counted; rather. you will be
called upon to do the same dirty
jobs that you have been doing all
along. Do them. and do them well.

I quote a Junior. who bolstered my
morale when she said. "Someone
who is loved is never a has-been."
Perhaps she is right

Fragments Varsity Baseball Slated For
April 22 Opener at Bleecker

By THE DETONATOR

So I went to the library (honesti.
I found a nice quiet table away in
the back. away front that cork—
screw with rungs commonly refer-
red to as a stairway. but serving
as a congestion bel‘t connecting the
poop deck with the engine room.
Anyway. there I was, in the mood
to study. and no noise to distract
me. I opened my book and began
to read. I read and I read and I
read. Visions of tli7il()lllpIiSillll(}lll
danced in my head.

But. good things must come to
an end. I looked up and there he
was . . . pants bel't‘cd at his arm-
pits. carrying a copy of the New
York Times. and Worst of all :.
package of Life Savers.

A shiver of horror crept up my
spine as he sat down and opened
the Life Savers. Then it began—
crunch. crumble. mangle, that hor-
rible assortment of noises that :ic-
companies the wanton disfigure-
ment of a Life Saver. Each sound
was like a shot. However, within
miiiiitcs, I became adjusted by
reading lil time with the noise. The
crunches became periods. the crum-
hle commas. and tiic mangles
semicolons.

But then, another series of sounds

crackle. shuffle. ruffle, He'd
ri~meinbered the paper. and was
lcafiiizz through it, shuffle. manglc‘
ruffle crunch. crackle. crumble.
ahiil'llc. iniiiiilc. riil‘l‘ic. i was through
studying.

judging from tlic way he handled
the Life Savers and the paper si-
multaneously. I would say that he‘d
been doing it for years. Why reader.
has he been illitth‘fI to Ho Lllit‘llt‘t'k-
l'Ii for such :1 long time? Must so-
ciety condone this sort of thing?
And worst of all, why did he have
to choose my table at which to cut
and read? After all. it is ll library.
not Howard Johnson‘s

People like this should be (It‘ilil
with harshly. They are a threat to
our emotional stability and to our
intellectual progress. In life they
should be stoned: in the afterlife
sustained on a steady diet of riib—
bcr Iiil'c Savers wrapped in old
newsprint.

iHoiiition on pagi- Iii

Circle the date of April 22 on your
calendar.

The baseball Peds have had that
date in mind ever since last June
when the opener was set with the
team that put the final touch on a
hard luck season that saw a talent-
erl teaim lose. not to better opposi-
tion. but to every bad break in the
book.

That J1me day came a Week after
the last chapter of 6-10 season was
written at Willimantic when a hard
hit bail took a slight hop and gave
the home team an 8-7 ninth inning
win after spotting the Feds a scvcn
rim leiid.

State lost that game in spite of
brilliant performances by every man
on the squad that entered the game.
with .333 left-handed hitting l’ete
Spina out with an injury. and a
booming home run by Bob Dzikowicz.

The Feds will be sporting ii lineup
this season made up of those play—
ers. determined to let nothing stand
in the way of the winning season so
near last year.

For Dick Lewis and Ray Haver. co-
cnptains. it is now or never. The
pair has been ill baseball since the
day either one could lift a junior
sized bat. with licwis learning the
game in Fret-port. L. 1.. while Havcr
played in Coblcskill. They held down
fourth and third place batting spots.
respectively. with Havcr hitting .319
and Lewis .354.

Dxikowicz followed licwis ill the
order. that once banged out ‘11 runs
lil ii nine-inning game. with .i .333
average. Spin-a batted ahead of
Havcr.

Lcadoft illilll .leri'y Gilchrist led
the team in netting on ba,.e and
walks among other things.

All live oi these men should be in
action against Williinantic on April
32.

The Feds also have a supply of
taiciit from such as Chuck Rcci-sso.

ton. who will be :i big man and an
ideal double play partner for second
baseman Gilchrist; and Jim Brown
who batted .500 15 for 10) before an
injury sidelined him.

From this it would seem that
coach Bob Burlingame has the (lif—
ficult but not unpleasant task of
selecting from a surplus of talent.
Pitching Potential

Not to be overlooked with pitching
potential is a still with experienced
lnirlcrs Rcccsnir Lewis, Siliilll. and
flank Mars ready to toss to l‘t't'l'l\'-
crs John Piivclka and Eric Kafka.

Tilt‘ story of the team that. will
take the field this season can best.
be summed ill the words of a prcss
release put out in June of 1059:

"This was a team that captured
the hearts of all who followed it.

 . . it was a team that outhit.
outscored, oiitraii, outfielded. out—
sliigged and oiitstolc the opposition.
it took more biiscs than the opposi-
tion. it. walked more. got hit by
more pitches than the opposition.
But it had more bad brcaks and bad
luck than the opposition.
