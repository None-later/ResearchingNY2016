“I cannot tell a lie; I did it with
my own little hatchet!" No, these
aren‘t the words of honest little
Georgie Washington! They're my

Dostoyevsky. It is a story depicting
the lavish wealth and the grinding

the striking color photography and
the musical score, both of which
help a great deal in enhancing the
drama’s savage and scornful moods.
