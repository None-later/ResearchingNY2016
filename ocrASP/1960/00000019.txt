Farleigh Dickinson earned the right to represent district 31 of the National As—
sociation of Intercollegiate Athletics at the national tourney held at Kansas City by beat-
ing the Feds in the ﬁnal round of the regional playoff, 56-53.

State has another chance to make the trip after a last. minute decision by athletic
department officials to accept Plattsburgh's rejected bid to the four team Montciair,
N. J. event. that began last night.

It was a Cinderella ﬁnish for the team that thought its season had ended last

Saturday at Cortland.

heartbreaking double overtime defeat to win the champion-
