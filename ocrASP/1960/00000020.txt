Is This All we're Worth?

. Are we well represented at collegiate sports events
With only five cheerleaders? Is representation an im-
portant aspect of our college life?

Four cheerleaders went to the Cortland Tournament
last weekend to represent a school of 2500. We feel that
this does not speak well for a school of our size and
stature.

At the tournament we observed performances from
at least ten cheerleaders, a majorette squad, and a band
from Plattsburg. about the same number of cheerleaders
from Oswego. Buffalo and Brockport, and. of course, an
en masse representation from Cortland.

One of the purposes for having only five cheerleaders
supposedly has been to eliminate any correlation between
“high school" and college cheering squads. This, perhaps,
is also the reason for the lack of formation routines. Con—
trary to opinions from those who claim to know, we found
performances by other cheering squads to be spirited. en-
thusiastic, and Collegiate.

A comment was also made that the only time any
cheerleaders received response was during the excitement
of a close game. Once again we must disagree. Perhaps our
lack of response was more noticeable since we had approxi-
mately 50 Albany rooters, while schools such as Plattsburg
had as many as six bus loads of students. We feel however.
with the right type of leadership. 50 people could con-
tribute as much response as 20o.

Solely Pedagogues?

We have been staring at the seal of the State Univer—
sity of New York for the past four vcars. Although l'or the
ﬁrst two years the stare was a look of awe. in these past
two years it has been a look of question.

The seal states "Let each become all he is capable of
being." This is a beautiful saying, but it seems to us that
New York State has the opinion that we are only capable
of being teachers, farmers, mechanics. seamen. or doctors.
There doesn't sem to be any room in our university for
pre-med students. business administration students or for
liberal arts students. Why?

Why does the University persist in retaining so many
small colleges scattered throughout the state which can
only give a limited education to a small number of people?

We realize that a large central university may have
many faults conected with it, but we feel that the oppor—
portunities offered to college students would far over-
shadow these drawbacks.

It is a well known fact that more students leave 'Tew
York State to get an education than other states send here.
We believe that these New York State students have no
choice. They cannot get the kind of education that they
want from a tuition free New York State school. and they
cannot afford to go to a private university. The door is
beginning to close on these emigrants because the other
state universities are making room for their own residents.

In the years ahead. will a prospective college graduate
be able to believe the seal “Let each become . .  Can he
belive it now?

eammunicatim

 

To the Editor:

We would like to say thanks to
everyone who helped make this
year's State Fair a successful Fair—
to Miss Lester and the faculty, who
put on an excellent Opening Show;
to the group committee chairmen
who so capabiy handled their booths;
to the State College News. who gave
us such good coverage; and to all
the people who came to the Fair
and spent their money.

As soon as we have a definite
calculation of money made. we will
decide whether we will be able to
take part in ii program to send one
of our Juniors to Europe for the
siuiiincr as well as to bring a foreign
student here to study next year.

For weeks. now. I have been shov—
ing my own opinions and attitudes
down the throats of many patient
and loyal readers. I have been fill—
ing this column with purely per-
sonal reactions to situations and
occurrences on campus which have
struck my fancy; I've used many
words. but have said little. The
time has come \\ hen not only many
of you students, but also I, have
become rather bored with my ramb~
liiigs.

I think it only fitting that, as a
pleasant change. The l‘rism should
reflect a new \'l(‘\VI)JIllL——'dll idea
not necessarily different from one
that I might have, out more. im-
portant. an id e ii expressed in a

You're on. Mr ‘l'aylo;

During a recent. conversation with
an instructor. :i couple of interest—
ing points about State College were
l‘lilst‘fl-wpillllis which nine a much
broader implication than liil.',lll be
gathered from a first inspection
Specifically. the questions deali
with "Is there an avant-gardc at
Albany State?" and “If there i».
should there be?"

To begin with. the term "urani—
t-iirdc" is suspe-t. Although siil
inoi'e respectable, say than "Beat-
nik," avant-garde" smacks ii little
ioo much of beards mic. Zen Bud—
uism to be completely acceptable
Due to the diligent efforts of mag-
azines ranging from Life to ('on-
t'ideiitial land this degree of range
could easily be questioned), the
public has. in its own inimitable
way. merged all terms such as
":i\'.int--gardc." "heat," and "Bohe—
mian" into one vast mess of mis-

interpretations. This of course. has
a direct bearing on the situation
here at State. Since this is a Tea-
chers College, supported by tax-
payers, we naturally nave to main-
tain "certain standards" (as people
are wont to sayi. Of course, nobody
ever bothers to examine these
standards except in a vague con-
demnation of anything that creates
ii stir in the placid puddle in which
we are tepidlv soaking.

Since the public censors most
.ivant-gardc groups and since State
is continually answerable to public
opinion, any avant—garoe group is
on dangerous grounds. But even
with this pressure being exerted,
I would say that there is an avant-
garde here at State. They are, how-
ever, not interested in an abundant
supply of publicity, ‘iaving learned
.i lesson from the Pruner-group a
few years ago. The school serves
as ii focal pointmit provides an
opportunity for students to become
acquainted with both knowledge
IIIll‘illl.;Il classes) and With people.
.\I'llll'(l with these, such groups can
he loriiied- -nebuloiis ones to be sure

but held together by common in-
ierests outside of school.

As to the question ‘Sliould there
b- .in avaiii-gari:c?". it, would seem
obvious that there shculii be if only
to make the. "noiinal" people of the
world a little more secure in their
righteousness.

One last thing: The public Il‘ili
l)e.:n trying to lit te.ichtrs into a
mold for years. Receiiiiy "there
seems to be a swing towards recoll-
llllelt! that a person iiiigiit possibly
:.i.ill be a good teacher WlillOllL be-
ing a walking, talking model of
middle - class iioraht '. In fact.
someday. there may be more edu-
v:iiion and less indoc'riniitiou iii-
volved in teaching.
