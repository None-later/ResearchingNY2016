STATE COLLEGE NEWS FRIDAY. MARCH 4. 1960

 

4% e; Slate

 

By FRANK SWISKEY

From the day that the ingenious
colonials set up their first road-
side bibulium in dear old New York
State, there have been pubs in many
of its leading communities. After
visiting one of these noble institu-
tions to view the future welterweight
champion of the world, I remember-
ed that I owed an article to that
renowned publication, the State
College News.

If writers could kill a college. State
College would be a dead duck. Her
young journalistic giants write fair-
ly well, but they seem to be engaged
in a running competition to see
which one of them can make life in
the “second home" seem most dis—
agreeable. In racking my alleged
mind as to what to throw to the
lions this week, I had the usual
thoughts of sarcasm. humor, sym-
pathy and rage. Then the rather
silly notion of writing a column
that praises people and things
struck me. Why not, even Albany
looks good in the spring.

It's just about over, but the State
College basketball team has proved
to all concerned that it still ranks
as one of the small college powers
in the East. Mr. Sauers may be the
next Yul Brynner and Denny John-
son inay be Santa Claus but we still
love you. All nine of us pigeons and
Sam included. While we're on the
subject, see the diamondmen in ac-
tion this spring; they're good, too.‘

being good and I’ll be all true. Put
on your last fairly clean white shirt
and toddle over to see “Guys and
Dolls." From all reports it may prove
to be State College's answer to “My
Fair Lady.” Too bad that it couldn't
run a. little longer, say one week.
Move over feathered outcast from
portals of electrified learning. you
are blocking the view. My program!

Speaking of spectaculars, the Jun-
ior class just might win my people
of the year award. Without a doubt,
the talent on tap for this weekend
will produce one of the more posi-
tive occasions at State College. All
cynics, beatniks please retreat to
the lower levels.

Since Kapital Kapers has vanish-
ed from the pages of the State Col-
lege News I shall recommend two
flicks, “On the Beach" and “Sap-
phire,” a deplorable exhibition of
advertising sophistry at its worst
but worthwhile.

State Initiates

Phi Beta

Barbara Lewick '61, President, an-
nounces that the Commerce Club
has professionalized its objectives
and joined the national collegiate
chapter of business educators.

The purpose of this change is to
increase. the participation of busi-
ness majors in the development of
competent leaders in business edu-
cition. National affiliation provides
guidance to collegiate groups for this
purpose.

As part of the calendar of Phi
Beta Lainbda‘s activities, monthly
coffee hours will be held. At this time
guest speakers renowned in the busi-
ness i'ield, as well as film, will be
presented for members. Other activi-
ties anticipated are field trips, panel
discussions. and conferences for
business students from local high
:,i-.li(i()ls.

An important new aspect is mem—
bership. There will be dual-tract
membership composed of Actives
itliose who pay dues and attend
majority of meetings and partici-
pate iii activitieSi and Associates
itiiose who pay dues. who do not
regularly attend meetings, but may
participate in specific activities.)
Active members have voting powers.
This arrangement is believed to give
more students an opportunity of
ioining the professional business or—
iaiiization.

Phi Beta Lambda is affiliated
with the UBEA of which the Future
Uiidncss Lcadcrs of America is at
diction.

Bridge Life

By RALPH WESSELMANN

This is bridge—a battle of wits,
an emotional catharsisi, a cause for
divorce, a mental suicide, an unpar-
alleled game of partnership, life in
miniature. Take your choice. If you
already play, you’ll find yourself
somewhere on this ascending ladder
of values. If you don't, then start
up the ladder to unequalled per-
sonal satisfaction or down it to the
most discouraging, self questioning,
soul-searching damnany frustrating
mental torture devised by civilized
man.

Sound interesting? Well, then,
whether you “play” or not, follow
these six steps:

1. Buy two books: Goran's Con-
tract Bridge and Watson's The Play
of the Hand at Bridge. Read them.

2. Play with a regular partner for
three hours, twice a week.

8. Listen to no explanations made
by peers, beginners or “experts.”

4. Read this column faithfully,
religiously and zealously.

5. Address all questions on play or
bidding to this column.

6. Do not cut classes; do not cut
your own throat.

Too many people either begin the
study of bridge or refuse to do so
because they are influenced by the
fallacious concept that in order to
play bridge one must be “math mind-
ed.” must know the mystic proba-
bilities of distribution, must juggle
with agility an indefinite series of
numbers to come up with the “cor-
rect line of play." The next incorrect
idea is that a bridge player must
possess “card sense."

Let me state my conclusion about
these matters. You do not have to be
a math major, a science major, an
army major or a voodoo major to
learn bridge. The one and only
thing you must be is a thinking per-
son. Why? Because in order to sur—
vive in life you have to think, and
bridge is life in miniature. It deals
with people, four of them. thinking
or otherwise; it involves attack and
defense; it has a language, complete
with vocabulary, proper or not; it
lies and sometimes cheats. It's '1
piece of my life.

Editor's Note: This is the first
in a series of articles to be written

for bridge enthusiasts. Next week's
column will be ‘Togethemess—lts
Application."
