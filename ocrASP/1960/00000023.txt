Drop Out or Fall Out?

This seems to be the question these days as students,
fatigued, depressed and just plain disgusted, ﬁnd them-
selves swamped with papers, mid—semester exams and
swollen glands. Thanks to the mid-semester break we had
this year, the “drop out rate“ seems to be headed for an

all time high.

It is our feeling that students are unable to Operate
under pressure and strain of 14 weeks of school without
even a “snow day." We do not feel that it is possible for
a student to put forth his best efforts in beginning a new
semester and obtain satisfactory results without some time
for rest and relaxation between semesters.

Other schools are able to afford their students and
faculty at least two or three days break between semesters
or an early Spring vacation. If they can do it why can't
we? The same answer is thrown at us all the time. “They
get out later in the summer, or their other vacations are
shorter." We do not think this is true.

We do not feel that getting out of school one week early
in the summer is worth having to go from one semester to

the next in the short space of one day and then continue
for 70 days straight with only homework-ﬁlled weekends to

rest and relax.

So what happens? We get an early Easter vacationA
the week before Easter, and the day after it’s back to school
—how nice. Yes, we are bitter and we are sure most of you

are too.

This is not merely a student gripe, but mutual feelings
of the faculty as well. Why then do the administrators
persist in refusing to recognize the need for a mid-semester

break?

New Label Needed

Isn‘t it about time for a
change? Ever since we can remember, this nickname has
been the inspiration for our ﬁght songs, a title for our
news clippings an dthe one and only nickname for our
school. The term “Feds” (short for Pedagogues or Pen—
guins depending on how you want to use it) has always
inspired our teams on to greater glories (in the same way
that a rotten tomato might inspire a political candidate).
We cannot criticize this nickname too harshly nor can we
praise it too highly. At most, we can say that the name

The Albany State Pcds .

is just plain blah.

We realize that our nickname is traditional, but times
change and we believe that we should adopt a nickname
that might be just a wee bit more dynamic. A member of
the sports department has suggested Knicks or Knicker-
bockers for a substitute name.
good name but other names may be better.
appreciate any suggestions that you might have and we will
do as much as we can in ordcr to secure the adoption of

a new name.

We think that this is a

Bridge Life

By RALPH WESSELMANN

A concept often neglected in
Bridge is that of Partnership. The
novice forgets that responsibility
for control belongs to two. This split
control necessitates a central pool
into which the trvo halves contribute
information. This information is giv-
en in two ways: language ibiddlngi
and signals (defense).

Let's examine the concept of bid-
ding as a language in an actual bid-
ding sequence. translating compact.
symbols into sentences. North (the
position at the table is indicated by
the points of a compass) opens the
bidding with “one spade." Transla-
tion: “Partner. I have a hand which
contains between thirteen and
twenty-one points; I have at least
two defensive tricks races or king—
queen combinationsi; I have at leiist
four spades to the queen-ten, per-
haps more; I will bid again if you do
not make a limit response. (“to lim-
it" means to put a ceiling on the
maximum strength ol ii holding). I
Wiluld like to hear if you have a
minimum of six points. aird finally
I promise to bid again every time
you introduce a new suit."

East says. “Pass.” 'l‘i'iriislatcd. this
means, "I have a hand which is
weaker ilrarr the minimum strength
oi an opening hand of thirteen
points; I do riot have a suit of six
cards headed by a sequence oi any
top honors."

South bids “'l‘w'o spades." "I have
ill least three spades including an
honor, I realize that you do not
have .I hand of minimum strength
of sixteen poiirts.

West passes, telling his partner
that he also has ii weak hand,

North bids “Three spades." "I do
have a hand with exactly sixteen
of seventeen points, but I would like
to know if you have if iiiaxniiuiii oi
nine of ten points. If you do, we
can make a game."

East passes, but. keeps his ears
open. It's not against the rules to
cavesdrop. South sighs a happy
“Four spades" which says, “I have
the hand you requested ten points.
With a combined holding of twen—
tv-six points we should make game."
All pass.

Albany Receives RepresentationBudget Pose
Chairmanship Biggest Problems for Senate

Al Penn Slate

Tire Albany State Debater's Coun-
cil participated last week in the J.
F. O'Brien Interstate Debater's
Congress held at Pennsylvania State
College. Through political maneuv-
ering and a coalition of New York
colleges, Albany was able to secure
the minority chairmanship for next
year.

Held on Friday and Saturday, the
event followed the parliamentary
procedure of debate with a model
student legislature. Bills were intro—
duced iir special cormnittees and
then argued on the floor of the
(‘ongress concerning the problem:
"What should the United States
policy be in the reunification of
Germany" and “Should Congress be
given the power to reverse decisions
of the Supreme Court?"

Air inexperienced Student Associ—
ation president and air even more
inexperienced Student senate face
what may prove to be one of the
most trying years in quiti a while
as far as managing and running
Student Association.

Robinson although a proven cap-
able leader has never been a sen-
ator and is not entirely familiar
with all the working of Senate. It
may be sometime before he can
groove the newly elected senators
into ll smooth functioning machier
.‘apable of running a $50,000 a year
business.

Representation

The main problem that will have
to be solved iii the following year
will be thiii of equal representation
iii the Senate. Many groups do not
tiriiik ilrat ilre class representation
that we have now is adequate and
they believe that it represents only
a small portioir of the student body.
President Robinson believes that it
will take at least three months of
survey and irrvcstigiitoii beioi'c airy
action can be taken on do.» prob—

The Athletic Advisory Board has
,]II.\‘L passed a budget tax which will
raise the present student tax $3.
and it will be up to Senate and the
president of SA to decide whether
it will be necessary to add :in ad—
ditional one dollar to this new raise.
For two years the student tax rate.
has rciriaiircd the. same, and the
question of whether it is desirable
to raise the tax at this timc is fore—
most iii minds not orin of the stu—
dents but of the faculty.

llippikill

Probably the biggest problem fac-
ing the SA administration this year
will be that of financing construc-
I.l()li on the college camp. Camp Coir-
sultiuit Smith of Michigan State
has shown high optimism in regard
to the camp at its present site. The
desii'iabihiy of a camp for such a
small college is still a question that

has to be answered. If we do need
a camp. should it be at its present
location or should it be moved near-
er the campus? Where can we get
the $20,000 needed to finance major
construction on the camp?

All these questions need to be an-
swered before any actual work can
be done on the camp, and these
questions have to be answered this
year. The camp has been idle for a
year and the Senate must decide
now ‘vhether to build or sell.

Other Problems

In addition to the 016 problems,
new problems must be investigated.
Under consideration at this time, are
the roles of students in housing and
curriculum, the adjustment to the
new campus, if and when it comes,
increasing power in the cabinet, and
ii host of other problems that must
be worked out.

President Robinson summed it up
by saying “if the forces of student
government choose to work closely
together, the Senate need not slow
down it. work and the student ad-
ministration will be able to cope
effectively with these problems fac—
