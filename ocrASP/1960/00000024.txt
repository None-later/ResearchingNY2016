By JIM noroimicrv

The Milne Junior Varsity basketball team recently

This included a season ending upsct victoi‘v ovci‘ previously

A word of sincci'c congratulaiions go out to Barry Jam-

_  * State Ends 16-10 Season by Naming
 Juniors Cohen, Bowen '60 Captains

A trip to Kansas City and national honors eluded State for the third time in as many
years last week as the Peds dropped a pair of playoff games, one to a rangy Maryland
State team and the other to Pratt, to end a season marked by steady climbing from below
a .500 record in the early season.

Maryland State‘s height advantage proved to be too much for the Feds as they
dropped a 73-55 decision in the ﬁrst night of playoff competition. It gave the Hawks the
rebounding advantage they needed to overpower the Peds.

Controller] Boards

The giant quint made State’s tallest man, Don Cohen,
l'ook short as they controlled the board, 39 rebounds to
State‘s 20. Six-foot-ﬁve Cohen was the only man able to
compete against this height advantage, snaring 13 0f the

To the Sports Editor:

Recently I have had to retire from
participating in an athletic sport
after having completed most of the
training. Those hectic two (lays of
calisthcnics took it out of me. Since
thcn I have been confronted with
snidc remarks from other sportman—
itcs. I quit because:

1. I'm a physical wreck.

. I have little will-power.
. I can‘t give up smoking.

4. I can't give up drinking.

:3, How could I have coffee in the
Union at 4:00 if I had to practice?

6. After all, bridge games are
rough on one's physical make—up.

7. Some of these forninls fall the

night before a couple of events.

8. I'm now a big “frat man."

9. Somebody else Ls better than
me.

Now I hope that you fellas are
satisfied. I'm so nervous since then
and am mad at you all for being
incunics. I‘m no quitter.

Commissioners’
Tournament

EEP's "Cinderella" team ran out
of gas in the last five minutes and
had to settle for second place in the
first annual Commissioners' Tour-
ncy.

The Loser's rebounding strength
made the difference as they con-
quered the hustling EEP's 74-50.

Jim Oppcdisano and Tom Ryan
led the Loser scoring attack, bucket-
ing 26 and 20 respectively. The real
story behind the win is that thc
Loser's are basketball players, while
the EEP's are noted primarily for
their hustle. When the EEP's ran
out of gas. the eventual victors open—
ed up and just “couldn‘t miss."

Pctc Barbagclatta, Chuck Recesso
and Tito Guglielnione led EEP with
14, 12 and 13 points.

Wrestlers Drop Final Match
As Biolsi Remains Unbeaten

By DICK AIIOLA

Albany State's varsity wrestling
team ended its season Tuesday night
in New York City as it suffered a
defeat at the hands of a scrappy
Yeshiva team by a score of 20-13.
The outstanding Ped wrestlers in
the meet were Lou Biolsi Jay Katzel,
Dave Pause, and Tom Ellis. Katml
pinned his opponent in 1:52 of the
first period, Biolsi aiid Pause won
decisions, and Ellis fought his op-
ponent to a draw.

This loss gave the Garciamen a
l-9-1 overall record. Although far
from an impressive record, this was
:1 l‘i‘l)llll(llllL’, season for the Peds. It
was ll. scllson with many withdrawals
and injuries, but it was also a season
marked with in'lprovcnicnis. 'l'his
improvcmcnt was due to thc detcr—
mination of the wrcsilcrs and thcir
colli‘ll, Joc Garcia.

Prospects Good

Prospects for next ycar :ippciir
good as ll more cspcril-iiccd and
stronger talm will tzikc to the mat,

led by veterans Pause and Biolsi.
Biolsi went undefeated in the 123
pound class this season. Also return—
ing to action will be Dick O'Connor.
Paul 'l‘urse. and Ellis. Several fresh-
man wrcstlers who showed indica-
tions of' being varsity material
should help fill in the weak spots in
the squad. Not without importance
is the return of Charlie Kanc and
the additioin of transfer Clam Crow
to the Ped lineup.

Crow won the most valuable
wrcsllcr award in the Adirondack
AAU Wrestling 'I‘olirnnmcnt held at
Page Hall last year, and Garcia rc-
gards him as onc of thc finest
wrcstlcrs in the state.

Student Interest

The only dark spot in thc picturc
is the hick of studcnt intcrcst, and
ncsi. year this l‘i‘liiil‘lt'i‘ will bc look-

loss of the season. 61-55, in the con-
solation game for third place.
Cohen—Bowen Lead

Next year's co-captains Don
Cohen and Sherwin Bowen. led the
Fed attack against Pratt, scoring 20
and 14 respectively.

Eclipsed by Gary Holway until
this season, Cohen came into his
own. breaking five school records.
He broke the free throw record when
he made his 1231‘d point from the
foul line in the Cortland Tourna-
ment; broke Gary Holway‘s record
of 497 points; he also made two re-
bounding and field goal records.

Sherwin Bowen became noted for
his sharpshooting performances in
last year's State University Tourna-
mcnt when he hit 100 per cent from
the field in the three game series.

The pair were unanimously named
ell-captains by the team. Both com-
pleted three years of varsity com-
petition and earned starting roles
after doing stints on the bench dur-
in;' their freshman year.

This was a season that saw coach
Dick Snuers' “Insects” come a lot g
way. From high man Don Cohen to
the lowest scoring man on the team,
who also won a trophy, the Feds
can be proud of the way they played
ball in 1959-60. They will be ll tough
team all the way when the 1960—61
season rolls around.

Wow! Here is my chance. I have
always wanted to pick an all-star
