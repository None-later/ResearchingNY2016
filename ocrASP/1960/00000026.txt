One More Time . . .

After viewing the revue last week, we are convinced that
such a professional performance should be run for a longer
length of time. We see no reason why a show of this caliber
with execellent direction, music, acting, dancing and stag-
ing could not be presented for the Albany public and more
State College students. The only way to make this possible
is run the revue for at least two or two and one half days.

It is a shame to see six weeks of rehearsal and hard
work end in only two performances. The show left very
little to be desired and we are proud of everyone who par-
ticipated in this excellent production. We only wish that
the Albany residents had been given an opportunity to view
this show. They are interested in what we do; they too.
would be pleased and proud of State College students.

Since the show was presented only two nights and both
performances were sell-outs to college students, parents
and friends, the area residents were not given a chance to
see it Many students were also unable to see the production.
We are sure that with good publicity and help of Albany
newspapers, it would be well worth presenting the show
for more than two performances.

The crew certainly is in favor of this suggestions. The
idea of two weekends of production would be detrimental
because rehearsals would need to be continued for another
week. We have a suggestion in solving the problem. Why
not a matinee? The show could be presented Friday and
Saturday nights with a matinee on Saturday and or Sun-
day afternoons. This would eliminate the extra rehearsal
period. Our idea is not unproﬁtable if a sell-out crowd
could be guaranteed, and we are sure this is possible.

Any production which is self-supporting and solely a
student production, endorsed by enthusiastic faculty and
students, should be given every opportunity.

Guys and Dolls ran on Broadway for at least three
and one half years; why not give it at least two and one-
half days in Page Hall“?

Voice of the Students?

Many people claim that this newspaper is not. as they
so loosely phrase it, “a true voice of the students." Nothing
could be further from the truth If the majority of the
students had some burning problem that had to be resolved,
the newspaper would be the sounding board to echo the
students pleas. But do we have any major problems in this
school? No. Granted we have many minute problems of
individuals but no one problem that can even be called
mediocre. Take a look around you and try to ﬁnd major
problems on this campus as far as the average student is
concerned.

The winning campaign issue in the recent SA elections
was whether or not the students should buy a bus. I cannot
quite see us hanging president Collins in effigy just because
we have to rent buses for our athletic trips.

Most students do not realize the latent power that they
possess as a group, and they will not realize this power
until there is some pressing need to use it. The newspaper
also has this latent power which cannot be utilized until
there is a need for it.

Our critics who say that the newspaper is not at pres-
ent the voice of student body must try to realize that it is
because there is no single student body voice.

To the Editor:

I was very much impressed by last
week‘s editorial entitled “Drop Out
or Fall Out," and I have a few coin—
ments to make.

Do not the students in this school
realize that. because we do not have
a term break of two days, that the
semester ends a whole two days
earlier? Think of it. a whole two
days reward for going seventy days
without a break. How ungrateful
can we get!

I also have a stiggestiori——\ve could
get out thirty-six days earlier if we
eliminate Saturdays and Sundays
and our real longr Easter vacation by
attending classes straight through.
After all. since finishing the sein-
ester early means so very much to
us all. why not take advantage of
this opportunity? We can take it.
we're just so many pieces of machin-
ery. or at least that's the opinion of
those next in line to God and de-
scribed by the obscure word “they.”
We. are missing a good thing. After
all. who needs rest?

Sincerel:
J.

To the Editor:

We would like lo say that we
heartily endorse your editorial on ll
Spring vacation or Mid-Semester
break. Not having one does alto-t
our work.

We do not know about villii'l'~ but
we had exams on the lzi>i exam day
After over a week of studying well
into the night and early morning
hours and then workini,r through the
exams themselves. we were men-
tally pooped.

However. ii day later we were back
in school craving sleep and starting
our se‘ond semester of college work.
This If: us seems unfair. We are not
robots. We cannot take just a few
hours off to have our transistors
el‘iecked and then be put back to
work.

Under such a system we do not
feel that we can realize our poten-
tial. The motto of our school is "Lei
each become all he is capable of
being." Without some time for re-
laxation the motto might just as
well be "Let each fly to the moon."
Both are lllsI as ‘IiSlly ll(.'C()llT])ll.\l‘i(‘(l.

Respectfully.

Cut Rules Unchanged, Rumors Falsified

As annoimced in the memoran-
dum to the faculty, the school's
new policy for student absences is
as follows:

1. Faculty

students are subject. However,
there may be special circumstances
regarding the work or attendance
of a given Dean’s List student
which one may feel should be re—

wm ported to this Oiflce.

lnem bers re port

each Friday all absences for that

week of freshmen, new transfer 3. Absences of upperclassmen
students and students on proba- not in one of the preceding cate-
tion. Students in these classifica- izories will be reported when, in the

tioiis are allowed no unexcused ab—
seiices.

opinion of the instructor these ab-
sinces have become excessive.

‘.2. Normally, faculty
will not report absences of students
on the Dean‘s List. ii these stu- llllCIl(l all their classes schedulul
dents are exempt from the attend- for the twentyufour hour period
ance regulations to which the other immediately preceding and follow-

member‘; 4. The procedure for holidays is
that all students are required to

ing a College holiday. The excep-
tion is made for those students who
have made the Dean's List. Inclu-
ded in this realm are graduate
students with an average of 3.5 for
the preceding semester.

5. The total number of absences
of every student will be reported
on the grade sheets a‘. the end of
the semester.

In conclusion these rules apply
mainly to those students below a
3.0 average. However, when these
rules are abuer excessively by
Dean's List students retaliating
measures will be enforced.

Fine Academic Standards
Shade Football Fanaticism

By IRENE

if one were to take a poll on any
street corner, U.S.A., concerning
the question: “What are the lead-
Ing colleges in the country?" the
consensus would likely not include
Albany State. Rather, the average
citizen would name the colleges of
Cornell, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania
State and Harvard. Why is this
so'.) The typical citizen is much iii-
i'luenced by the propaganda of a

well known football team or the
distinguished long history of cer-
tain colleges. Because Albany is

primarily an academic school, it is
not publicized in the same manner
as a college like Cornell. However.
does this make Albany a lesser
st'llUUl, or should the students be
apologetic towards it?

Albany State, like many Colleges
in this area, has been accredited
by the Middle States Association
ior a period of twenty-five years.
This merely states that all colleges
similarly accredited have the pre-
\CI'llX’tl courses in ouantlty and
quality to conform With the stan—
dard set by the association, A stu—

batlon last semester while 11 per-
cent were on the Dean's List. The
total average of the college was that
for every person on probation there
were two at or above the 3.0 level.

Our nitration or moments here
is commended by Dean Lanford.
The United States Office of Edu-
cation has made a study and shown
that in a 4-year sequence less than
40 percent gradﬁte than began.
and it is even less for the teachers
colleges of the nation. However.
Albany is well over the 50 percent
mark.

The growth of college is also an
important factor to consider. In
1950 we had 1,639 students while
now the number stands at 2,830 and
plans for 1965 include an enroll-
ment of 3,200 students. At this very
point in the year applications for
admittance for the class of 1964
have excelled last year's total by
60 percent. Dr. Schultz has added
that he plans to enroll 700 fresh-
men ior next year.

In l‘i'ti'iiSpt‘CilUll. we see that
Albany State dislmmishes itself in
