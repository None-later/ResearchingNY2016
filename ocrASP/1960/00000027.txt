‘Guys & Dolls' Outstanding Debaters Travel
Hit, Ticketwise, Talentwise To West Point

State College Revue. Guys and
Dolls. It: was a pleasure last Sat-
urday night to meet again all of
Damon Runyon's fabulous charac-
ters as a slice of “Runyonland” life
was created for a delighted aud-
ience in Page Fall.

The opening introduced us to the
characters and atmosphere of the
musical in an exceptenally fine
manner. with “Fugue for Tinhorns"
which brought down the house.

With the first appearance of
Danny LaBeille as Nathan Detroit.
the music really blasiei into orbit.
In my opinion, his characterization
of the quick-marrying gambler was
one of the high points of the pro-
duction. Giving an equally stellar
performance as Miss. Adelaide.
Frannie Fleck. can: and sneezed
the audience into the palm of her
ringless left hand. She provided
another high pomt of the first act
with her touching “Lament.”

Ralph Smith and Stie Norton.
singing the 1‘0le of Sky Masterson
and Sarah Brown came through
the show. and the Havana brawl.
with flying colors. "If I Were a
Bell." “My Time of Day." and “I've
Never Been in Love Before" were
very well done. Bob Fox as Benny

Southsireet. Joc Ball as Nicely-
Niccly Johnson. and Bill Burnett
as Big .lule. th» finally repentent

amused us mniinuaily. In
contrast to thc "sinners" of the
show was Martin Moison. as the
kindly Arvide Abernathy. who sang
"."rIoi‘e I Cannot Wish You."

A show cannot depend just on
leads. however. A chorus is neces-
sary. and the various choruses of
this show were excellent. from the
Mission Group to the Hot Box Girls
'.() the male chorus in ihe Sewer
Scene. I. personally, fornd it hard
to believe that their's was an amu—
teur performance.

The high point of the show. the
Second Act Mission Scene, grew
more hilarious by the moment with
Bob Fox at his funnnst. The cli~
max of the scene wro. Joe Ball’s

Well . . . um , . . ahein . . . I‘m
back again. but not be nose of the
tremendous amount of fan mail that
I didn't get. It‘s been a rather disil-
lusloning experience. discovering
that. no one cares whether the
Prism is shattered or not. Like I feel
unloved and unwanted. But at least.
i can‘t feel unneeded because l‘ve
been informed that we need this
column to fill tip a sixty-line holt'

reason or incentive in the world for

been roaming and moaning through
the halls of Husicd looking like I've

Ed. Note: TWo weeks ago, a note
appeared stating that feature arti-
cles would be discontinued indefin-
itely. This was not an attempt at
censorship but rather a move to
stimulate a reaction from the read-
ers. The reaction. although not
overwhelming. is significant enough
to cause tis to revert to our old policy
of including features. Amen.

While browsing in the Co-op the

rack filled with white printed cards.

Closer examination disclosed this
printing to be in the form of various
witty sayings.

Having a bit of time at my dispo—

From those I selected a few for pur-

other of State’s campus life.

“Don‘t Start Vast Projects With

“Please! Let‘s Keep This Confu—

there‘s a motion already on the
floor!)

"If You Don't Have Anything To
Do Don't Do It. Here.” (But I like
it. licrc iii the library.)

“Blessed Are They Who Run
Around In (‘ircles. For ’I‘hey Shall
