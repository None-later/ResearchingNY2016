The climax of the 1960 AMIA basketball campaign to reportiNg the facts and keep my eclisped ﬁve of Gary Holway’s records in leading his team

came Sunday afternoon as

Coach Vic Mickovich dealt a deadly blow to the Commis-
sioners’ Tournament champion Losers. A standout per-
formance by reserve Lynn Western can be cited as the
driving force of the Stars in their “upset” victory. Western,
who sat out the entire ﬁrst quarter, entered the fray at the

10-minute mark and proceeded to ﬁre in 24 pomts (9 ﬁeld kept the Losers within Striking dis_

goals and 6 free throws).
Second Half Spree

Neither team caught ﬁre until the
second half of the contest. The
Losers scoring ace. Jim Oppedisano
hit for only seven in the “coir”
period. but came through with 16
more during the ﬁnal 20 minutes.
Lynn Western matched Big Jim
point for point in the second half.

Losers Lose Two

The loss 01 011; Tom Ryan and
speedster Al Rabinowitz hurt the
Losers greatly and stalled their en-
tire attack. The Stars lost the serv-
ices of Lou Lucidi who had to make
a sudden dash to the hospital. Lou
could have been a big help, but in
the end his efforts would have only
been gravy as his teammates han-
dled the struggling Losers with ease.
