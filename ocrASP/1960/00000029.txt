Me~too ;.. a funny little fellow in
the comic strips but at State, Mc—too
is a tragic character. Perhaps char-
acter is giving the followers of Me-
tooism the benefit of the doubt as
their only character is that of an
entire group and they are merely
parrots of the group. Unless these
pathetic characters have a chance
to echo rue-too, they are living non-
entities.

You can find them congregating
in doorways, in the halls, or around
the tables in the Union, where
they lap up verbal crumbs of a few
leaders. Later. they are found in
other groups utilizing the ideals,
witticinns and cliches of their pre-
vious gatherings.

As an applicant for admission to
this school, I was led to believe that
leadership was one of the main
criteria for admittance. I now have
an idea that I was deceived or the
Administration has changed its pol-
icy. A third possibility is that the
neophth scholars are awed by tht'
larigeness of the- group or by thi-
vast knowledge of the group clari—

then it is time to revise or eliminate
the groups.

It is not necessary to be “beat”
in order to be an individual. To my
mind. this is as bad as the me—toos.
An individual merely questions and
analyzes bciore accepting. This is
true of the dictates of the group and
all the information acquired in the
various classes. No information is so
positch that it can pass unchal-
lenged, at least mentally if not verb-
ally.

Me~too changes his philosophy of
life, his mode of tiicss, and his mati—
iier of speaking from day to day.
depending on his group, his classes
and the various literature that he
reads. Me-too does not question an
"authority" on fashion, philosophy.
or ethics. he morle accepts and
modifies his bi‘litll'iUi‘ lli order to

The National Young Democratic
Student Federation today called for
passage of legislation which would
repeal the use of the disclaimer aﬂi-
davit and the loyalty oath of the
National Defense Education Act. The
group's nine member National Exe-
cutive Committee meeting in Wash-
ington urged in a strong resolution
the organizing of letter-writing cam-
paigns on. American campuses to
members of Congress informing
them of the wide student protest of
section 1001 (f) of the NDEA.

The group in a resolution stated
that the Act “represents an unwar-

ranted invasion, on the part of the
United States Government, into the
traditionally private area of per-
sonal belief.” The Student Young
Democrats further charged that "the
affidavit and the accompanying loy-
alty oath single out students as ob-
jects of suspicion."

The Executive Committee, speak-
ing for more than 500 college chap-
ters of the Young Democrats, term-
ed the provisions presently included
in the NDEA as “insulting the Amer-
ican academic community.”

field of American higher educa-
tion, the committee stated, “the at-
fidavit and loyalty oath are ineffec-
tive in protecting the national
security, and may even harm it by
preventing otherwise well-meaning
students from accepting ftmds under
the Act."

The Democratic Party has earlier
stated its objection to the disclaimer
affidavit and loyalty oath through
statements issued by the Democratic
Advisory Committee and resolutions
passed by the national convention of
the young Democratic Clubs of Am-
erica.
