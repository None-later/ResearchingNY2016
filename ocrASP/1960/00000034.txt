STATE COLLEGE NEWS FRIDAY. APRIL 1. 1960

 

“I Disagree with . . .
what You Say . . .'

Last week we stated strongly our position on the Wool—
worth picketing issue. We would like to emphasize that
we have not changed our opinion in regard to the method
used by this particular group. We would, however, like to
applaud this group for exercising their rights as free
Americans to state their beliefs.

In the past week we have heard these peOple called
every name imaginable, ranging from “queer” to “sub-
versive political antagonists". Why must this be so? Are
we, who are supposed to be educated people, so ignorant
of the ideal of racial equality, that we have to resort to
personal degradation in order to maintain our present
system of inequality? We know. personally, that this group
is making a sincere attempt to insure the rights of all
creeds and colors. If we differ from them it is because of
method. not of purpose.

We consider ourselves very fortunate to have been
brought up in a country that prides itself on the ability
of its population to express their own ideas, no matter how
diverse they may be from the accepted norm. If we refute
this idea of freedom of expression we are undermining our
entire democratic system.

We feel that insistence on group conformity has be—
come so great that no one individual or group can vary a
single degree without leaving themselves open for personal
tacks. To associate these people with a subversive political
ﬁroup is showing nothing more than our own complete
ignorance of the ideal that they are representing.

Some of these personal attacks have been very serious.
yet some students in this school insist on spreading these
attacks. using only unfounded gossip for their so-called
“reliable sources".

We also feel that. while we as a majority must respect
the rights of small groups such as the Woolworth's picket-
ing group, these small groups must not, on the other hand.
publicly try to present themselves as representing the
Opinions of a much larger segment.

We sincerely hope that when anyone does differ in
opinion with this group they will attack the isue at hand,
not the people involved. RCG.

A Print Hint

As prospective teachers, we may. at one time or an-
other, be l'aced with the problem of supervising a high
school newspaper or yearbook, writing articles for local
newspaper, or perhaps writing articles for an edu 'ational
magazine. Since this is entirely possible and probable. we
feel it necessary to have a journalism class initiated here.
Whether you be English, math, or business majors, this
“problem” concerns you.

This proposed course would furnish the ne'cssary
background for basic elements in journalistic writing and
provide an adequate working knowledge of publications.
The benefits reaped from a class of this nature would prove
to be practical in both the present and future lt'l' an stu-
dents.

Our idea consists of a th)-t'l't‘(lll hour course offered
both semesters on an elective basis. (.‘nicsi speakers in the
field could be obtained for class lcciuics. ’l'his would avail
students the opportunity to realize the importance of cllcc—
five communications.

The course should be general enough to include only
introductory material necessary to grasp basic concepts of
_]()l.ll‘llullSlTl. Not only would this class prepare us as future
teachers. but it would encourage active participation in our
own student publications.

We do not see why we should be deprived of ilic oppor—
tunity to bcconic acquainted with llllfil'llllillfill that is be-
yond the scope of our present, i‘iqiiii‘ciiiciit..

To Whom It May Concern:

“If you take this position you must
keep in mind that. you will do all the
work and receive none of the glory.
If we lose it will beyour fault. If
we win it will be a team victory.“

Why forget that we almost won
Rivalry in our freshman year after
the lopsided Sophomore victories
which came before us? Why forget
the people who worked. who gave
up their hours and hours to the
class?

Why forget the class newspaper
which was published more regularly
than. and sustained longer than any
in the past years? Why forget to
give credit to a successful class ban~
quet'.’ Why forget the class members
who were outstanding in their work
on State Fair. State College Revue
and other affairs? Why forget the
class contributions to student gov-
crnment?

Why forget that the criticism will
cnly pierce the cars of those who did
work» -iind not. praise those who
didn‘t? Why use salt on the wound?

To the Editor:

Gossip. gossip. everywhere. but
now is the time to think. Hare you
heard the rumor going around school
at the present time about formal
weekends? Well. the big question
seems to be whether girls are going
to be able to sign out for lioiels or
motels on formal weekends, Perhaps
.i siiideni ilioiiglii. this was :i good
rumor to start; or perhaps. it has
been in the minds of our adminis-
ii'uiion. If lllt' latter were iriie. they
must have a reason. We doubt if
they dislike the idea of girls stay—
ill: in ilic hotel or motel: but the
problem arises when considering
condiici.

May we remind the student body.
especially ilic girls. that a code of
honor was submitted to the student
body by MYSKANIA. We doubt if
their intention was a substitution for
ilic code in the handbook at the
present time. Yet. we think the pur—
pose was in :4ch the students a code

CAS DA Receives Contract State Host to
From Education Defense Act School Scientists 45 Colleges at Convention

The Cooperative Research Pro-
gram recently instituted by the Capi—
tal Area School Development Asso-
ciation is now in full operation, ac—
cording to Dr. Donald T. Donley,
Executive Director of CASDA and
Professor of Education at the Col-
lege of Education at Albany where
CASDA has its headquarters.

Under a contract between the fed-
eral government and the State Uni-
versity. the U. S. Office of Education
supplies information concerning the
results of research projects in the
field of education to CASDA and
also provides lists of researchers
working currently on major projects
in particular subject areas so that
CASDA may plan for direct contact
between educators in the field and
researchers.

To facilitate the work of the Co-
operative Research Progrinn. ilic
Office of Education has furnished
funds which made, it possible. for
CASDA to add two staff members
who assist in the classification of
tlic resciircli inf'oi'iinitioii received
and its dissemination to CASDA
member schools.

The iiiin of the new project is to
reduce ilic lag between the publica-
