Fragments

By THE DETONATOR

Only six more school daze 'til
Easter recess. . . Hear about the
Martian that landed in New York's
Central Park? He was about to go
into that old jazz about "Take me
to your leader,' but before he could
he was mugged. . . . Then there was
the collegian who, along with two
Na vajos, took an underwater basket-
weaving course. The prof curved the
marks and he flunked. . . . There’s
a new deodorant on the market. It’s
trade name is ABSENT. Does noth-
ing to combat B.O., just makes you
invisible so's no one knows where
the odor is coming from. . . . I wish
the kid who does the vo:al lead on
that 'Who's Our Pet Annette' record
thing would forget about his ‘Bickey
Bouse Ears ling enough to blow his
dose. . . . And will someone please h-
h-help that. “Puppy Love' character
before it's too late. I don't know
what it. is that he's trying to do,
but whatever it is it sounds obscene.
. . . From the looks of those new ash
stands in the Commons I'd say that
something died and left the school
a fortune in coat-hangers.
How come om' student body contains
so many unimaginative conformists?
We lose a contest or something? . . .
It‘s kind of tough working this type-
writer with webbed hands A
sure sign of spritig—~Seycral robins
were seen on Central Avenue picket-
ing Woolworth's——Wcll at least there
are a few if as with guts enough to
flirt with, yoti should pardon the
expression, radical ideasw-It’s about
time that somebody around here
roared. . For those of you who
are interested. a couple of books just
rcleased——You can pick them up at
almost any shop tthat is if you're
quick enough) ~—S0 YOU WANT TO
BE A UBANGI and FUNERALS
(‘AN BE FUN. . . . Well there will
not be another NEWS until after
Easter; so I hope I’ve insulted at
least a few people. Otherwise, it'll
be an almost unbearable ten days of
rest. and relaxation. . . .

 

While in the process of purchas-
ing my weekly milkshake at the
Student Union (it was Tuesday
night again. time to play my role
as a columnist», I happened to
glance tip at the regal colored rec-
tai etc which graces the area above
the snack bar. Printed in large
yellow—orange letters across the up-
pct‘most area was the phrase
“State University of New York."
(Rather impressive, I suppose.)
Across the bottom of the banner
'as “State College for Teachers
at Albany." (Not very impressive.)
The value, or lack of same, of these
phrases is not the fact which draws
my attention. Instead. i am inter-
ested in the inconsistency which
the format of this banner symbol-
,,_.Sv
Our school no longer holds claim
to the name of “State College for
Teachers;" we are now the “College
of Education.” Why then is the
banner left to hang there, a. rem—
nant of days past?

Also included on the. surface of
this banner is a reproduction of
our Goddess, standing proudly in
the mildlc of a golden circle. (Bles-
sed are they who go around in cir-
cles . . .i I had always been under
l'.lt‘ impression that the elongated
object which Minnie holds aloft is
a, spear. On this meager represen-
tation, liow'cvcr, it is l ltilt'll. Really.
now, can't we be a bit more con-
dBLf.‘ilL':’ And who ever heard of
Miverva wearing a night cap? I‘ll
tell you who—the creator of our
banner!

Perhaps I shouldn't criticize this
honored scrap of felt too harshly,
for it: has well served the purpose
for which it was purchased. A very
reliable source has informed me
that ours was the Inggest and
brightest banner at the Cortland
'l‘ournainent. If that were the case.
who Cill’i‘.\ if it‘s not accurate?
