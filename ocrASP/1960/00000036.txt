STATE COLLEGE NEWS FRIDAY, APRIL

1. 1960

 

 

74a Ream W/ty. . .

The winter of 1959-60 saw a few new logs on the ﬁre
of the hot stove league.

One log in question was the now-fashionable debate on
the success or failure of the newly formed Continental
Baseball league.

It is a very fundamental debate, because it touches the
veiy core of the American concept of sports and of the
traditionally American game of baseball.

Yes, baseball. With its hot dogs and peanuts, and the
guy in front of you who thinks he knows it all and tries
to prove it.

Baseball, with the traditionally browbeaten umpires
and the seventh inning stretch. The time when the home
team won on a close play in the last of the ninth; the
Casey at the Bat epic repeated across the land.

Why this appeal to millions? Why the drive to have
big league ball or nothing at all? Do people really want
baseball? Or is it a drive to conform with no real meaning?

Are the residents of a small town in Central New York
that interested in the fortunes of a team hundreds of miles
away?

Or is it possible that baseball has become a business in
which the public is tricked into this superﬁcial loyalty by
ingenious devices of publicity men?

This writer lived in a city in which there was Inter-
national League ball played. Thousands of people would
cheer for the home team, rejoice with a win and sorrow
with a loss. They went to the game because they wanted
to see their team win—and their team stood for something
with which they could identify themselves.

Yet. this giant of major league baseball marches on.
killing off, like a giant parasite. the host on which it feeds——
the local, home town team that provides the grass roots
of the big show of big league ball.

Now there is a move afoot to create a new major
league. The cities which were “minor league“ will now. by
the stroke of the sportswriters pen. become “major league"

. and the source of talent in nearby cities will. by this
designation, be choked off. I

The basic. fundamental appeal in baseball. or any
sport, lies in the identiﬁcation of the spectators with a
home town team. When this breaks down. and baseball
grows like a huge bubble that will surely burst of its own
size, something has been lost that may never be regained
by the American people.

Small Squad

Answers Net
Practice C a/ l

A tennis turnout that coach Mer-
lin Hathaway called “disappointingly
small” will be starting its second

week of practice in Milne Gym
Monday with most of the partici-
pants in good shape.

Both the freshman and varsity
response did not ineastu‘e up to the
number that Hathaway had expect-
ed. Inclined to attribute the poor
turnout to the winter-type weather,
he did praise the conditioning of
the majority of those working out.

Three Way Scrap

The fight for the top berths now
looks like a scrap between Lou Wol—
ner. Carl Penird, and Dave Baum,
as Bob Austin, far out of shape, has
at least temporarily eliminated liiin-
self from the race. Also after posi-
tions on the starting six will be
Steve Myslinski and Bill Carper.

Baum, who has consistently been
impressive on the courts, reported
in good shape and has looked good
so far in practice, Woliicr. Pciiird.
and some newcomers also have been
giving good showings.

Friday of Easter Week
Marks Start of Baseball

Varsity baseball practice continued in high gear in

Page gym this week as State prepared for the opener at.

Bleecker Stadium on the first Friday after Easter Vacation.
Bob Burlingame’s charges have been practicing plays
on the local hardwood, waiting until the weather breaks
to get a chance to get out on the ﬁeld.
They showed they meant business, too, for the Fed
bats, even though were swinging at rubber practice balls,
bomed out some lusty drives that sent onlookers scrambling

for protection.

Kafka Hits

The biggest noise from the bat
was made by Eric Kafka, a catch—
ing prospect who whaled the day-
lights out of the ball in his tries at
the “plate.”

Kafka. a Senior. saw limited action
as a substitute catcher last season
behind Tom Buckley and John
Pavclka. Pavclkii has been greeting
ball with fire in his eye himself, and
with a healthy scrap for the cat-
cher‘s spot emerging. both should
produce well in the next week of
practice.

Joe Burton. shinning like a
neon sign in his drive to talu- over
the shortstop post, made his bid
cvcii stronger this week by piistii’ig
the bull while doing some glossy
“tit-id” work.

Gilchrist :iiid Pozowicz were their
ii-~ti:il outstanding selves on the floor
in all (lcpni'tincnls.

Spring Thoughts

By DAN LABEILLE

“Spring has sprung and the grass has riz, I wonder

Thus it is that spring comes to our campus: the dis-
appearance of snow, the mud on the shoes, the smell of
fertilizer once again combining with the fragrance lof'the
young grass to surround our campus with a very distinct
odor. Spring. that warm season when a young mans
thoughts turn to baseball, golf, and occasionally women.
Shortly, dorm ﬁeld will be dotted with bare legged sun
addicts striving for a natural looking tan.

It is amazing to see the various ways and means
utilized by the males of the campus in trying to catch a
better glimpse of the feminine display. One of the most
popular methods is to get a bunch of guys, a bat, a ball.
and go out for a little practice. The typical conservation
between the batter and the catcher might sound something

like this:

C Hey Will you look at that set of legs!

B VAWherc'?

C-Ovcr there, coming out of the Union.
B ~Not bad, not bad at all. Who is she?
(TM-Some freshman from Syracuse.

Br—I wonder . . .

C WWhat‘.’

B . . . if she‘ll go out with me Friday night.
C Watch out, here comes the pitch.
