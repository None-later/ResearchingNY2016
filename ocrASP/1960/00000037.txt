SC A Promotes
Student March

The Student Christian Associa-
tion Wednesday evening took posi-
tive action against discrimination
in the North and in the South by
voting to support the sympathy
march tomorrow, and take construc-
tive follow-up action.

The group’s purpose in support-
ing this march is threefold:

1) “to make discrimination on is-
sue in the North and to show sup-
port of anti-discrimil ition bills in
our state.

2) to show support of and sym-
pathy with the action of Southern
students involved in sit-down
strikes.

3) to express our belief as Christ-
ians that all men are one in Christ
and that discrimination is morally

wrong.”
After nearly two hours of
thoughtful discussion with SCA

President Robert Nelderberger pre-
siding and Charles Dalngerfield.
Robert Factor and SCA members
participating. the group voted to
support tomorrow’s demonstration.

Natalie Clark, after saying that
“we are supporting, not sponsoring
the march" and that “as Christians
we can and must take the risks
involved in such action, trusting
in God" moved that SCA officially
support the march planned for to-
morrow, stating SCA’s purpose and
ideas.

David Gillette SGCO'lTlL’d the mo
tlon which was passed by a vol
of 14 to 12 with 2 members a‘i-
staining.

Bridge Life Selective Service Exams Open April 28

By RALPH W. WESSELMANN

One of the things I noticed while
playing at the enormously success-
ful faculty-student Bridge tourna-
ment held last Thursday at Bru-
bacher Hall was the complete lack
of deception on the part of various
declarers.

Among the several errors made
along this line are: (1‘. failure to
plan the play of “the hand before
you play a single card (more mis-
takes by the novice are made at
trick one than at any other point
in the game); (2) pondering over
the card you are going to play gives
the show away; (3) false-carding
from ‘habit (false-carding is the
playing of a card higher than nec-
essary to a losing tricki; (4) play-
ing a card froth your hand or from
dummy with the expectation of los-
ing or wimling the trick: (5) failure
to make your opponents guess.

Let us examine a few examples
which will improve your actual play
a. few percentage points and your
concept of the game a hundred-
fold.

The National Headquarters of the
Selective Service System has just
announced that the 1960 Selective
Service College Qualification Test
will be offered to college students
April 28 at approximately 500 col-
leges throughout the nation.

Executive Order 10562 stipulates
that to qualify for student defer-
ment in the graduate school, a
registrant must stand in the upper
quarter of the male graduates of
his senior class, or he must have
passed a. Selective Service College

Qualification Test with a grade of
80 or better.

In 1959 fewer than 0.53"; of those
eligible to take this examination
actually took it and the ratio has
been less than 2% for the past four
years. The result is that many col-
lege graduates are entering grad-
uate school without either of the
two alternative qualifications for
student deferment.

The age of induction is now ap-
proximately 221/{a years, and many
students are being called up in the

study. Although the l-SfC) classl-
ficatlon may be used to tide a stu-
dent over the academic year, his
ultimate status remains in doubt.

Deferment extends liability for
military service until age 35. It
should be emphasized that, by tak-
ing the test and passing it, the
student has not committed himself
to deferment. He has merely pro-
vided himself wiffh an option that
he may or may not excercise.
