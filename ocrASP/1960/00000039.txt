STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY, APRIL 22. 1960

 

 

Wellington Weekends will soon be
in full swing . . . Yes, you can tell
that Spring is here because the
male population is counting its pen-
nies and various segments of the
female section are dieting like mad
in their last desperate attempt to
squeeze into their roommates' for-
mals. Fill up the flasks, polish up
the pins. confirm the reservations,
and let the good times roll! Just
remember who you are . . .

t it: ‘1

Spring at State also used to mean
the presence of a few peeling faces
around campus. Perhaps some of us
were discouraged from a week of
sunworshipping by the fear of be-
ing discriminated against at Wool-
worth's? Or maybe the scholarship
checks didn’t arrive in time? At
any rate, a mere handful of us
managed to make the annual pil-
grimmage to that haven for frus-
trated college students called Fort
Lauderdale. We seemed to be the
only school whose representation in
and around the Elbo Room con-
sisted of fewer than twenty stu-
dents.

However, we collegiaiis who did
go tried our best to uphold the rep-
utation of otu‘ Alma Mater as far
as stamina is concerned. We brave-
ly endured the bleak, windy, man—
o~war infested Florida sunshine in
a desperate attempt to return to
school looking as if we had fallen
asleep under a sunlamp.

Unfortunately, the only results of
our sandy efforts were colds, hang-
overs, blank bank accounts, no
Easter outfits, and tans that look
like they came from a bottle. But
at least we have memories—and
reservations at the same hotel for
next year.

By ELAINE ROMATOWSKI

The one thing that put a damper
on the excursion, however, was the
fact that most of the more noted
universities were still paying the
Florida taxes long after We poor
students were signing in at the
dorms. I will never cease to be
amazed and puzzled at the fact that
while SUNYCOE at Albany finds
it impossible to give us a vacation
at inter-session, and more than ten-
days at Easter time, other institu-
tions for higher learning are con-
staiily offering their fee-payers
more than adequate rest and re-
laxation periods.

t 1! 4:

I hear that the outlaws of our
social calendar are finally being
spun back into circulation. State's
lawbrcakiiig swains are busily dust-
ing off their skimmers for the party
which our kind and generous IFC
is allowing them. I just wonder
where they‘re going to find a cellar
large enough. bare enough and
sound—proofed enough for this their
first step back on the road to re-
covery. Like I said, just remember
who you are . . .

Professor of History, and State‘s first and formost baseball fan.

After that, ace leit-

hander Pctc Spina, will takc ihc mound to bid for his second triumph of the season.

Pcic's first win came as the l’cds sneaked ill a game while most students were
home on vacation, when lic held Danbui'y to thi'cc hits while fanning ton as the Feds
smacked ihcir hosts, 11—5, in a game shortch to seven innings becausc of snow and

cold.

Following thc Willnnuniic gainc, State will meet Potsdam at Blccckci' in a 2:00
pm. Saturday coiitcsi. Thc cngagcmcnt also should Sill‘ up interest as thc Pcds had

The sport expands the

number of spring sports to

The combination of spring vacation and inclement
weather forced coach Dick Sauers to abandon full scale

My upologics to Potter Club. In
my lasi. column I said that they will
have ilic sumo train as last year. I
have bccn informed by ii couple
of their “old ycts" that they only
liayc two men rciurning. i made a
boo-boo.

From my llill'l'OW point of view, I
see it as :1 two tcain race. The Pogos
lil'i‘ thc ii'mn to beat and Potter has
the bcsi. possibilities of doing it.

In the past. pitching usually made
the team and Potter has the best
pitcher in Lou Call. John O‘Neill of
the Pouos looks sharp and Tony
Amelio was tough last year. The
difference in the teams will be the
hitting. I can only judge on past
pcrforinanccs, so I give the Pogos
and their 19-1 record in the past
two years the nod to repeat.

Question of the week. Will the
Albany rain and mudflats allow the
‘cague to cud ihe very short five
wcck mison'} I have my doubts on

the numbcr of games played.

last season, winning seven points.

Wolncr, who led the team in point
production lust season with 15 points,
was fourth man. He is a hard work-
