AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL‘

By DAVE FELDMAN

“How did you like student teach-
ing," This seems to be the most pop-
ular question at State College. The
people who ask this question are not
only the Seniors who want to com-
pare notes, a surprising amount of
underclassmen ask this of returning
teachers.

It is perhaps ironic that most stu-
dents here know relatively little
about student teaching. They must
learn fast, however, when they are
put into a classroom of thirty stu-
dents. Yet these eight -weeks are cer-
tainly the most important weeks that
we spend at college.

To begin with. student teaching is
most assuredly not actual teaching.
The student teacher is still a stu—
dent as much as. if not more so
than. a teacher. I do not mean this
in the “If you become a teacher, by
your students you’ll be taught" sense.
Rather I mean that the student
teacher is still a college student, re-
sponsible to his teachers too-oper-
ating teacher, supervisor) as well as
to his students. In short, he is
teaching, to a certain degree, for a
grade, and a recommendation. Many
people say that this is good, and
that the pressure put upon the stu—
dent teacher by these college related
factors make him become a better
teacher. This may be so. The prob-
lem is that often inot always by any
meanSI the student teacher does not
teach the way that he would in an
ordinary teaching situation. Student
teaching, by its necessary limitations
of a mark and a pink slip. is not an

actual teaching situation.

I do not know if this is either
bad or good. But I do feel that an
attempt should be made to make
student teaching more true to life.
Perhaps a. change in grading proce-
dures would be a start in changing
this.

Another factor of which most stu-
dents are not aware until they be-
gin to teach is that they will spend
less time actually teaching than
they suspect. This is confusing and
disillusioning at first. We at col-
lege are used to classes with well
behaved students who (usually) want
to learn. It just is not so in many
high school classrooms. Remember?
Too many of us, I feel. think that
we will be at the head of a. class of
worshipping students who will hang
on our every word. It. takes the stu-
dent teacher some time to realize
that this just does not happen, and
then he must adjust to this.

Bridge Life

By RALPH W. WESSELMANN

Many errors are made in the game
of bridge. The novice makes an av-
erage of one per hand. while the
expert fears he is losing his mind
if he makes a mistake per week. It
is this gap of mistakes which I hope
to shorten this week by discussing
the area of hand management . . .
the sequence of thoughts which is
involved in any hand played.

Assume that you are the declarer
at any contract. The opening lead
has been made and your partner is
laying his hand down. What do you
do? If you are a novice, you have
reached for a card to play from
dummy and you may well have made
your first mistake. Remember what
was said in the last article: More
mistakes are made at trick one than
at any other point in a game. Put
the card back. Take a deep breath,
light up a cigarette and begin to
think.

Question: Cali I make this coil-
tract? To answer, you lilust count
the number of tricks you expect to
win. Then you should count thOse
you expect to lose. If, when you add
the sums together. they total thir-
teen, you have the answer to your
question. When the total is not thir-
teen, you know that the hand re-
quires further thought.

Sometimes the crux of the problem
rests in finding outstanding honor
cards. To solve this problem, you
have several aids. The first one is
the blddiiig. Question: Did either
opponent bid? If one did, attempt to
construct his hand. If he opened
the bidding he must have the equiv-
alent of at least two Aces and a
King. This will give you an inkling
of how you sliouid play. Even if your
opponents have not bid, you have
iilfoiimiltioil. You know what they
can't have.

More on this subject next. week,

The 1960 Mid-Atlantic Model
United Nations Assembly took place
at the college April 8-10. The week-
end sessions opened Friday night

with iipproximately 450 students
from 45 different eastern colleges
attending.

Mr. Asdribul Salsamendi, Director
of Inforiiuition of the United Na-
tions Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, was the key—
note speaker. He spoke on the topic
"Building Fences of Peace." “Since
wars begin in the minds of men it
is ill the minds of men that the
fences of peace must be constructed,"
declared Mr. Salsamendi.

"The task of UNESCO." he coli-
iiilued.  to build these fences of
peace in the minds of men." He de-
scribed UNESCO educational pro-
grams- particularly those directed
against illiteracy in Latin America
and in South East Asia.

The visiting students stayed lll
Alden Hall aiid Waterbury Hall and
sessions were held there and in Page
and Draper. Saturday night Student
Union Board and Forum sponsored
a dance for the visiting delegates.

Dr. Elbow when interviewed, de-
clared that from all reports the Con-
ference was a "great" suecess. “The
teamwork and cooperation of the
students who worked for the Coil—
ference were highly praised by all
of the delegates. Many students and
faculty from other states made their
first acquaintance with the State
University and they were most pleas—
ed with living. facilities on our
campus."

Dr. Elbow continued, “The new
doitliitories impressed them very
much. In no small way our students
have helped to spread knowledge of
the United Nations. Our own dele—
gates and many of those from other
colleges remarked that they had
learned. so much in the preparation
for the conference and during the
conference itself."
