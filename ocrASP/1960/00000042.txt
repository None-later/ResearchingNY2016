“How was your co-operating tea-
Cher?" is a question frequently
asked of returning student teachers.

I have observed that most of the
co-operating teachers that I have
met, if not all of them, were friend-
ly. sincere in their efforts, and al-
ways ready to help. A person may
have all these qualities, but they
are useless. unless he knows Just
how to use them. Many of the co-
operating teachers just do not know
what is expected of them. I say
many because the number of co-
operating teachers have had sev-
eral student teachers. But they have
learned the some hard way; by
direct experience.

Again the student teacher is often
torn between his desire to please.
and often emulate. his co-operating
teacher; his desire to teach the
way the supervisor may want him
to; and his desire to teach exactly
the way he wants to.

I feel that both these problems
could be cleared up by a meeting of
these three people prior to student
teaching: perhaps several meetings.
We are told in our education courses
that we must at all times set our
objectives and determine our com-
mon goals. Why are we not doing
these things at this vital phase of

Finally I should like to discuss
the concept of making student
teaching as broad and as actual an
experience as is possible. I feel that
in many cases this is not being
done.

Many student teachers have only
average, or below average, or only
superior students. Many student
teachers are placed in schools where
there is a distinct discipline prob-
lem, others where the students are
models of disciplinaiy perfection.

I am aware of the problem that
this school has in finding high
Schools and co-operating teachers,
let alone ideal ones. I do feel that
an attempt should be made in this
direction. Only by attempting such
seemingly impossible tasks do we
ktcp improving. Someone once said
that a country that  not moving

forward is backward. This idea is
not limited to countries.

While our present student teach-
ing set-up has some imperfections.
it is still a most illuminating, edu-
tational, and worthwhile eight
weeks. Our present system is turn-
ing out teachers who are. amongr the
best in the country. But I do not
frei that we should stop here. While
there is room for improvement. let
us improve. And then improve on
the improvements.

Panel Discusses Student Teaching Problem

A panel of experts participated in
a panel discussion last Thursday
evening in Brubacher Hall, entitled.
“Grading Practices in Student
Teaching." Each person on the
panel represented a different group
interested in this problem.

Average Grade
It was brought out during the

ivening that statistically. the aver-
age grade received iii student
teaching was a “B” with over 90%
of all student teachers in the last
8 semesters receiving either an A
or a B. A good deal of discussion

also centered around the basis for
awarding seminar grades.

At the end of the meeting, a vote
was taken of the students attend-
139: as to whether they wished to
continue the present system of
grading or institute a system of “S”
and “U” marking. Of the 30 persons
there who had completed their stu-
dent teaching, 27 dcsired an “S”
and "U" system, while 2 wished to
continue with the present. system.
The education department is pres~
entiy looking into the question.

Mine/we’d Made

By ED BRENNAN

It seems that, in the rush of Spring
social events and the pro-graduation
shuffle. we don't hear the usual bar-
rage of destructive, sarcastic, and
often inane criticisms which are
levied upon our school and its stu-
dents: particularly as regards the
isupposedly) poor social facilities
and the ‘uncollegiate’ student body.
The innocent entering freshman is
exposed to practically a wholly neg-
ative introduction to the college,
since he is nearly overwhelmed with
said criticism, in both the words
and demeanor of the upperclassmcn
and. even through tne school's own
newspaper.

Today the furor has abated, due
primarily to the fact that the stu-
dents are too busy to complain. (Al-
though. even now, one may read that
the students are non-“coilegians”,
because they do not spend their va-
cations in Florida, the happy hunt-
ing ground of all the good, ‘coilegi-
ate‘—type studentsi

The point is, however, that the
chief cause of this criticism lies in
its expounders' own inactivity. Proof
of this can be found in the present
lull in the bombardment. The Inkl-
vidual (Pardon my Freudian slip!)
attempts to fault the school for his
own extra-cm'ricular inactivity. Per-
haps we may attempt to refute some
of their claims. To do this one needs
only to look about them and see
what the school has to offer to those
who are interested and energetic
enough to grasp them.

There have been, and will con-
tinue to be, basketball games (next
year), complete with an interesting,
winning team; top-notch theatrical
endeavors, both home made and im-
ported: fine, big-name guest artists,
Stevens and Demus; and, complete
formal weekends of the sororities
and fraternities, tremember?); plus
numerous other vehicles of Whole-
some and erudite recreation.

Right now. the varsity baseball
team is meeting with great success
and fine fan support. Our backers
have duly supported the home team
and ruzzcd. sometimes a bit too vig-
orously, the opposition. Visitors to
Biccckci' Stadium will find not only
the most successful baseball team in
State's history; but, also, other dif-
fuse and colorful added attractions
iinto which we will delve no fur-
ther.)

Though it has been said many
times before, it is no less true that:
we will take no more from college life
than that which we put into it.

It the powers that be so decree,
next wi-ek we will continue in the
tit-iciisc of our school. in the never-
ciidiiii: battle of NYSCEA versus the
(‘l\'ili7.i‘tl world.
