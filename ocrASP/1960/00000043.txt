Call Hurls Opening Day No-Hi’rier;

By GARY PENFIELD

The new AMIA softball season
got underway in spectacular fash-
ion last Monday when Lu Call tos-
sed a no-hitter against the Goobers
while Potter, KB and the Pogos
registered first game victories.

KB, Pollen p°99§§

In the opening game of the sea-
son. behind the fine hitting and

fielding of Russ Knights, KB de-
feated APA by a score of 10-7. Joe

Hill tossed a three-hitter at the
men from South Lake while his
teammates were busy collecting

eleven hits to back him up. Joe was
very wild in the first three innings
and issued many walks but settled
down and only was touched for two
hits and three walks in the last
four innings. Bob Battaly. Russ
Knights and Mert Sutherland each
collected two hits for the victorious
cause.

The second game of the season
saw Potter demolish the Goobers
and Al Jaquays while Lu Call was
hurling a four inning no-hitter
against the Goobers. Lu. a veteran
of the softball diamond. proved to
be in top form as he struck out
eight of the twelve men he faced
and allowed but two free passes.

The fate of the game was decided
quickly by Potter's second batter.
Dick Mann. who lined a home run
to left field. Dick also collected an«
other hit during the game and
played an excellent game for the
Club, catching the fireballing Call
and throwing out one of the Goob-

er's two base runners in an at-
tempted steal.
Art Strassle was the top hitter

for Potter as he collected three hits
in three attempts. Lu Call slugged
two hits in three tries for his own
cause while Joe Swicklbauer scored
four runs.

The final score of 20-0 does not
pomt out the true potential of the
Goobers. Pitcher Al Jaquays was
extremely wild throughout the en—

Softball Season

By no FENDIK

Well, we're well into our intramural softball season
here at State and seeing as how this is my ﬁrst column on
this sport I’d like to put in a word for those who bear the
brunt of that menacing cry, “Kill the umpire”. This poor
mistreated individual who must support his often crucial
decisions reminds me of a story which I came across the
other day: The score was tied. It was the bottom of the

ninth inning. The ump yelled, “Batter up"

The batter

was a monster, the catcher was a tough 225 pounder. and
the umpire was a skinny fellow. The count was 1 and l,
the pitcher whistled in a fast ball.

"Two" the umpire shrilled.

"Two what?" snarled the catcher,
lifting his mask threatenly.

"Yea. two what?" gritted the bat-
tci raising his Club.

The ump looked from one brute
to the other.

"Too close to tell.“ he said. mov-
ing for the exit.

Ouch

Chi Sigma Theta. pitching in to
start their softball season with a
“in. edged Kappa Delta 4-3 in last
’l‘hursday's game. Laecing behind
the Kappa Delta girls who held a
tin; run lead during the first. two
iinings. the champs tied and ended
the third and last inning one up
in their opponents. Increasing
doubt, of Chi Sig winning the game
had hovered over the field like a
heavy blanket when illt‘ll' catcher
l‘oane Donk. had injured her knee

iiI a fall. But the unfortunate ac-
ctdeiit seemed to have given the
\ictoi's greater incentive to defeat

their opponents.

in the other scheduled game for
the day Phi Delta \’.lli([illi~ili0(i Mad-
ison-Lake. 4-0. Phi Delta faces Chi
Sigma Theta in its next game. while
Kappa Delta will attempt to gain
and maintain a leading score when
it vies with Sigma Alpha.

From this corner it looks like the
(rims outnumber the hits in the
neophyte season. I can't blame the
iiil‘icldcrs because the diamond is
like a huge washboard. Reminds
nu- of my youth when I used to
17lily baseball in the cow pastures
with circular bases.

From what I saw of the game
K13 may be a surprise They had
a well-balanced team when they

downed APA. Potter came throuin
a little stronger than I expected. I
i-nly figured that they would win

’l‘lie Pogos shaved a close one.
(loud thing someone kicked the ex-

Penird, Baum Lead State To Golfers Drop
Opening Win Over Potsdam

Varsity tennis, scheduled to swing into action again
Monday afternoon at New Paltz, underwent a major shake—
up this season as coach Merlin Hathaway put a highly
revamped team on the courts to beat Potsdam last week-

end.

Carl Penird led the netmen in their 1960 debut that
saw all six singles men win their matches and two of the
three doubles teams win theirs.

One newcomer will be on the starting six, at New Paltz
Monday. as Don Cohen earned the right to represent State
in singles, while Penird, Dave Baum. Lou Wolner. Bob
Austin, and Bob Carper will also compete.

Bob Bolender may see action in doubles.

State will meet Oneonta at home Wednesday after-

Third Match

For State. Monday's match with
New Paltz will be the third outing
in the ten match schedule, follow-
ing yesterday’s match with Siena.

The match with Potsdam was
never in doubt after number one
man Pcnird disposed of his man in
three sets. 6-0, 5-7, and 7-5.

Wins In Two

Baum used a variety of shots to
vanquish his opponent, 6-2, 6-1.
while Carper, Austin. and Bolenedcr
all needed three sets for their wins.

Wolncr, number six man, required
only two sets.

Fine Playing

State golfers dropped two matches
this past week. losing 5-4 last Fri-
day afternoon to Siena. and 9'32-8‘2
Tuesday afternoon to Utica College.

Despite these two losses, the links-
nien looked good and with experience
and practice should develop into a
winning team.

Casey. Story Impressive
Thus far, two Sophomores. Roger
Casey and Bill Story. have been the
outstanding golfers for the Feds.

Both have taken medalist honors.
with Casey shooting a. twelve over
par 82 against Siena and Story sev-
en over par 79 against Utica.

Among outstanding players during
the past week was State's number
three man. Al Wagner, who took
three points against Utica. Newcom-

Out...

a success is this one.

State has four games on the road
A —two at Brockport today, the one at
Rochester tomorrow, and at New
Paltz Monday. The ballplayers know
they can take these teams. They
have come through with wins in
their games With two of the oppon—
ents who beat them last year, with
the slugging of Dick Lewis and
pitching of Pete Spina leading the
rest of the players in great showings
on the field.

It is hard to find fault with a
team that scores 12 rims and still
hires a game. How did they lose it?
When they lost. 18-12, to Potsdam,
shortstop Joe Burton. who had two
of State's six hits against Utica.
summed it tip quickly: “there’s no
defense for a walk.” Eighteen Pots-
dam batters strolled to first base

Saturday.
This team is strong and during
the past week flexed muscles

against four teams. beating three of
them and almost beating four.

A bright spot Is the performance
behind the plate of John Pavelka.
who caught an excellent game for
Spina when he set his strikeout rec-
ord. and has been showing signs of
coming around at the plate—«when
opposing pitchers dare to pitch to
hiinwas he has walked 11 times to
lead the team in walks this season.

Jim Brown has hit some of the
longest balls seen in a long while at
he local ball park. while Joe Bur-
ton aiid Jerry Gilchrist have been
coining up with defensive gems and
have reeled off two double plays in
two games.

Eric Kafka. who will share the
rcccivnig duties today with Pavelka,
has been pounding the ball at bet-
ter than a .300 clip. \vhilc Chuck
Recesso has three hits in five times
at. but including such a long triple
it rolled on the soccer field at
Blccckcr stadium and caused such
an argument that Potsdam protest-
ed the game,

Jerry Gilchrist has been having
problems at the plate not with hit-
ting thc ball. but hitting it at oppos-
ing oiitfieldcrs. The flashy leadoff
second baseman. who lost that role
to I’avclka. has been having knee
trouble but has been managing to
smash drives to deep left field where
ilic pesky oiitt‘ielders \vcre camping.

(‘ii»t'ii]il:illi ltay llaver also has
had troubles. with no base hits but
ioiir ltlil's and seicn bases on balls
to his credit, and uncountcd
smashes that Just went foul.

This is a hard iiittiiig. fast mov-

in; team that will be in action on
the road until \‘i’cdnesday when
()iieonia will invade lilccckcr Sta-

diuin State will inch Plattsbiirgh at
lllecckcr one week than today. and
all fans worthy of the name should
be on hand to welcome the Feds back
from their road trip at 3:00 Wed-
nesdiiy.

Dugout diggings: Spina began his
record breaking performance in the
rain . , . outfielder Jim Brown had
to do some iiiiicy driving when the
game balls almost got lost in the
shuttle and he had to bring them
to llleecker . . . Brown was carried
to the dugout by his delirious team-
mates after he smashed the game
winning homer in the opciiiiig game.
