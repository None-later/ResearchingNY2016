Bridge Life

By RALPH w.

Besides “reading” the bidding,
further aids in solving the problem
of making the contracted number
of tricks in a Bridge game are (1)
examination of the opening lead,
(2) counting the cards played, (3)
cbservation of signals used by the
opponents, (4) observation of man-
nerlsms of your opponents, and (5)
mathematical percentages.

After you have examined the
dummy and noted the outstanding
honor cards with reference to the
bidding done by your opponents,
your next step is to consider the
opening lead. Why did your oppo-
nent play that card? Why didn’t
he play this card? If you are miss-
ing a combination of Ace-King.
King—Queen, etc., and it hasn’t
been played, you know that the
honors are split or are both in the
hand of your right-hand opponent.
If an unbid suit has not been led.
you may suspect that the suit led
is one your left-hand opponent is
short in and thus may “ruff”
rtiumpi the suit later on.

Counting the cards played from
each suit should become a care-
fully cultivated habit. With con-
stant practice it will become auto-
matic. This rule applies as fully
in defense as in dummy play.
Counting enables you to construct.
the suit pattern of your opponents‘
hands. Because Bridge is played
with a finite number of cards (52)
and each hand holds 13 cards, you
know that if your R.H.O. (right-
hand opponenti holds 3 spades, 4
hearts, and 2 diamonds, he mtist
hold 4 clubs. This information may

determine whether you make the
contract or not.
To enable you to get an early

coimt, the signals of your oppon-
ents can be useful. If your opponent
leads the deuce of a suit in which
you are short, you have a count of
the suit to within one card for the
deuce means he holds 2 or three
more of that suit and it usually
means he holds at least one honor
card in the suit.

If a player “echoes,” you must
decide whether he holds 2 or 4 cards
in that suit. The general rule will
be in favor of a doubleton.

The mannerisms of an opponent
include such simple things as light-
ing cigarettes when he has a pleas-
ing hand, looking bored when he
has a poor hand, and being obvi-
ously interested in the defense of
the hand when he hopes to set the
contract. Or mannerisms may be as
subtle as arranging a hand in a
pattern which never changes, i.e.
high cards left, low cards right,—
or spades left, hearts next, clubs
next, and diamonds right. You have
only to observe from what place
in his holding your opponent draws
the card in order to have an edu-
cated guess as to how many cards
he holds in the suit being played.
(Caution—J have found that this
backfires occasionally.)
