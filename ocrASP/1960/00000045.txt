No Appreciation

What does the State College News mean to you the
Students of this School? We know what it means to us.
Unfortunately we have heard and seen what it means to
most of its subscribers. Two weids deﬁne your views
“Absolutely Nothing".

To be more speciﬁc we will explain your ideas on the
News. It is something you pick up every Friday morning
with very little thought or concern about how it comes
within your reach. The paper to many is a sense of enjoy-
ment in that a crossword puzzle is conveniently provided
to ﬁll a hour that would otherwise be spent listening to
a lecture in class. To others the paper acts as an absorbent
for coffee cups or coke spilled on the tables in the cafeteria.
Still others consider the paper an inarticulate piece of work
which gives them pleasure in circling errors and laughs
at incorrect English.

At this point we would like to inform the students
what the paper means to us: twenty-two hours of work
every week, plus pleas and more pleas with organizations
and individuals for accurate facts to meet deadlines, and
Thursday afternoons and evenings spent usually in Hud-
son, 40 miles away, which entails a 2 hour train ride

We are regretting all of the time and work we spend
with this paper, however it irks us to hear comments like
“who cares about the paper anyway."

Each and everyone of you should care about the paper.
Your opinions are respected if or when they are set forth in
an intelligent manner. We are trying to please you but if
you don't care how are wc to be expected to satisfy you.

We care about the paper. We are proud of our paper
and we feel it is worth everything we put into it. If we
didn‘t care we would be like the rest of you, unconcerned,
iaxidasical, uninterested "bookworms."

Our satisfaction comes with sceing the paper printed
and available every Friday morning just as yours comes
from criticizing or not caring.

More Infra-University

We have seen, within the last few years, an attempt
by the various four year colleges of the State University
to ban together in a league type system in order to pro-
mote athletic competition within the State University
framework This coni'crcncc, which is named the New York
State Athletic Conference, has takcn a large step in ordcr
to provide rules for eligibility and for means of recruiting
athletes, but we feel that it has not taken enough action
providing for a State University competitive league. This
league would have standings, championships and trophies
and would, we feel, spark an interest in our sadly apathetic
sports contests.

Granted. lip scrvicc has been paid to this idch and
meager action has bccii taken in the form of a soccci' stand—
ing, which has littlc or no incaning, and a baskctball
tournai‘ncnt. We rcalizc that thc problcnis of schcduling
has a great dcal oi bcai'iug on this inaction, but wc i'ccl
that plans could bc moving along iastcr than tlicy arc at
present.

Anothcr point is, wc lch that this conlci'cncc should
not be liii’iitcd ciitii‘ciy to sports. Compctitioii in othci' ac-
tivities such as dcbatuig, public spcuking, thcatrical coiii—
petition and olhcr activitics should also bc includcd in this
lcaguc. in this way sports would i)l' oiily oiic part of a
much largcr group o1 nitriciiiiivcrsity coinptilioiis.

Wc would likc lo applaiidc our own Dircctor oi Alli
ictics l'oi‘ hcing so iiisiriiniciilal in ihc formation of this
conl'crcncc and wc sincci't-iy hopi- that this conicrcncc will
soon bc the dominant agciicy lil lhc l'xll'ltel'lil‘l'lclliéil' (‘iliii~

To the Editor:

 

It is not our intention to begin
a pen-pal policy with the mysterious
“The Editors“ who have so unjustly
filled the editorial coliunn for the
past two weeks. However we feel a
clarification is necessary for the
STUDENT BODY, and with THEM
in mind, we write this letter.

We. appreciate your
attempts to present
“complex problems" for Senatorial
investigation: however, let's give
credit where credit is due.

First lct us examine your “orig-
inal” list of “complex problems."

Your first point dealt, with iii-
vcstigiiting‘ a new method of repre-
sentation. Perhaps we should rc-
iunne Grant and Jackson Houses
"Manchester" and follow the Eng-
lish precedent of "rotten boroughs.“
We also question this point it coni-
plex problem or a leading campaign
issue of the present administration

As for leading campaign issues
l\\'illCil your first editorial accused
us of overlooking). may we inform
you that action has bccii taken on:

1. Featured iinpi'ovcincnts leg.
the crcalion of a new cabinet post ~
that of Student-Faculty Ministeri.

3, ’l'runspoi'tiition Iinvcstigiitioii
has been made on the purchase of

4. College Camp «The Camp Coni-

“How joyous to be young and
animal in the leaping Spring-throes
of Washington Park!" For the sake
of avoiding a libel suit, I will admit
that these words are not mine, but
are rather the product of one of
the most individualistic. respected.
well-liked. and sensitive minds cvcr
graduated from this campus.

I must admit. he had the right
idea. It is joyous to take a walk
around the park on a spring-scented
sunny afternoon. Why cvcn the
overgrown plate of pea-soup that we
call a hike looks beautiful in the
Spring.

Time was when an afternoon of
soft brcezcs and incllow sunlight
would resith in half—cinpty class--
rooms and completely~cmpty-bccr-
can studded grass in ihc park Those
who didn't. fancy baseball could bc
sccn strolling hand—clasped along
oft—ti'oddcn paths. Whatever hap-
pciidcd to those days of yestci'ycur?
Thc siui is still licrc, the park is
still green; aren't there any more
romantically inclined personalities
left in school? Or would we just.
i‘lttill’l' sit. in classcs or in tlic
library all day? Perhaps wi- should
be more careful about the type of
students we are accepting into this
institution. A hundred and fifty IQ
is ii wonderful thing. but a school of
2.000 students possessing nothing
clsc docs not constitiilc llic l(il‘ili
learning situation if we are umd l
certainly hope wc urei here to
obtain it well-rounded education.
'I'licrc happcns to be some of us
icit who bclicvc that :i 40 isn't
everything.

Maybe if sonic of thosc clods
