Affording dcclarer a ruff in one
hand while he discards from the
other is usually a losing proposition
to the defenders. There are times.
however. when resort to this man-
euver may be the oiily means of de-
fcating a contract.

Today's four-heart contract was
reached after a highly competitive
bidding sequence. West's takeout
double had certain iniirinitics but
circumstances required immediate
action. East‘s onc spade call over
the redouble meets with our hearty
indorscmeni. However. his failure to
bid four spades when partner
doubled four hearts marks our part-
ing of tlic ways. East's length in
.-.padcs must water the defensive
strength of his side's holding.

West opened the king of spades
and continued the suit in response
to partner's signal. forcing the dinn—
my to trump Declai'er drew two
rounds of trump with the king and
jack. A low club was then led off of

Henry Boehiilng, Dick Wolf. Men‘s
Hall. Dave Frank. That takes care
of the payola and now I can get
down to writing the column.

My tip for the week is not to hit
down the third base side against the
Goobers. John Rath looks like a
cross between an octopus and a chee-
tah with a touch of plastic man.

The last few games made the Po-
gos look like the teams of old.
S.iucrs' mystery pitch reminds me of
an underlianded Preacher Roe. See-
ing Hathaway, with that pretty
Riithian swing. makes this writer
feel good. The coach is pretty fancy
with that glove on first and contrary
to the rumor. he can still get up in
the ozone for those high throws.

The pitching iti this league is par
for the gii'lies league, btit is terrible
for this league. Saiicrs and Call are
the only pitchers that can hit the
general area around the plate.

After the first round. here is how
the teams look to me.

Pogosr-rno problem. good sticks in
Hickey. Millet. Davis and Johnson. a
ring—tailed polccat. Pitching is more
than adequate. No holes.

Potter good pitching. poor field—
lllL'. and iiiiiilert play. Moderate hit-
ting. Oppcdisano and Mann are the
heavy wood. Overconfidciit!

KB pitching could bc better Hit-
ting is poor and the weakest point
in the team. Fielding adequate. Mert
Sutherland is playing good ball at
short. The tcani could be tough.

APA pitching is off and will be
better if supported. Ami-ho has to
work too hard too long. HittlliL',‘ is
fair. The defense look.» like the 1o-
c.il little league. Modder and Earle
are the bill. sticks. For my money,
Earle is one of thc bcst iii the league.

SLS fair hitting and defense.
Lacks a good chucker. Could im—
prove.

(‘ioobers top defense. strong on
the left side. Good hitters in Ruth.
Shiner and Durante. i’lli‘illllq is the
sore point. This team could be
spoiler if they find a pitcher.

AMIA:

Pogos Take Top

On Two Wins;
SLS Victorious

Experience once again proved to
better than talent last week as the
Pogos‘ stepped into the lead in the
the AMIA softball league by virtue
)l two victories over their closest
L‘iiilllii‘llltlll'h.

’I‘hc l’ogos. who seem to be loaded
with experience and talent. walked
to a 93-4 decision over KB iii a
iiici'rv-co-ioi nd marathon. Each
team collected scvcii hits but the big
difference ‘.‘ll.‘s iii the number of
free passes issued by each pit/'hci‘.
.Joc liill. KB pitcher. L'ILH' up thir-
tccn bases on balls and one hit in
the fifth llilllllt', which resulted in
twel‘. c runs for the Pogos. Hill was
vary iiicffcctiic throughout the en-
lirc game. Dick Saiiers who pitchcs
for [lie l’ogos was content to put thc
ball oicr the plate and let his field—
crs catch the fly bidls which result-
cd Joc Hiikev's outstanding glove
work aided in the snbdiiing of the
KB tciini

'l‘iieudav. the I’ouos look advant—
age of l’ottci (‘liib‘s incxpci'icncc
which icd to nervousness which led
to errors whn h led to ten unearned
runs and thc victory for the Pogos.
’l‘hc final score was 10-7. Potter
moch to a four run lead in the sec-
ond inning and held that lead until
the fourth inning when they fell
apart defensiiely. Four rims were
scored in that inning by the Pogos.
but it was ill the next inning that
the roof \‘ll'lllilll_\’ caved in on the
l’oitcr team. in this inning. due to
the lack of hiistlc by the Potter out-
ficid,. thc Pogos with the aid of
many timely errors scored six times
and clinched the ballganic. Dick
Siiiiers was once again content to
put. the ball in the strike zone and
let his fine oiiifielders catch the
long fly balls

SliS won its first game of the
:I'iisoli. 13-5. over winless Goober
nine. Harvey Kaufman went the
route for SliS giving up six hits
and four free passes. "l‘lic victors
iarnercd only seven hits but took
advantage of free passes and loose
lieldina by the (ioobcrs in order
to tally llit'll' thirteen runs. Dayt-
