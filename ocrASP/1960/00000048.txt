STATE COLLEGE NEWS FRIDAY. MAY 13. i960

 

Tribute to Dave

It is not often that a college student dedicates J: years
of time and effort to activites that are usually unrewarding.
The feeling of satisfaction and the memories he now
possesses, however, are, to Dave Miller, reward enough for
his truly oustanding contributions to our colleges athletic
program.

We feel that Dave has contributed so much to State
that it seems a shame that more cannot be done to honor
Dave in a manner which would truly exemplify the caliber
of his innumerable contributions. Seeing the joy and
pride of such a modest individual radiate through a crowd
of over 200 athletes at the recent Award Banquet was in-
deed a memorable event. As Dave approached the head
table to accept an engraved gold watch for his outstanding
service. none was aware of his size for he was truly bigger
than all of us.

Dave's contributions to our tiiELii'ilt' program have bu ii
varied. The athletic program have been varied, The .ith-
letic program has bcn varied. The .ithlv“ ii' department
found in him the capabilities of an organizer. ti puibii n»—

"Deitric me. dearie me!" (as they
say in the Italian Straw Hat) today
is the day to beware of easily brok-
en mirrors, unsteady ladders. and
blnck cats. I don‘t know about black
cats. but I've seen it few black sheep
bloating and bleeding around camp-
us during the past week.

Yes, todin is Friday the thir-
iccnth. and. being as grth :1 pessim-
ist us I am. I naturally am anticl-
piitlna a disaster of one sort. or an-
othcr. rite has certainly been liv-
ing; up to my expectations so far: the
Pogos have lost their catcher and
their first game. the Primer seems
to have remained an abstraction,
and the (‘ommonStater will soon be
it tradition of the past. To top it iill
off. this is the last week the News
will come out this semester. Please
stop cryingr like that!

I certainly hope that the influ-
ence of this diiy will have no effect
upon the activities in Page Hall to-
nichi. I Would hiiic to see ii repeti—
tion of the "bad luck" witnessed
(illl'llii! liic Rivalry Skits of ii year
and :i liiilf iigo.

Then. of course. something could
no wrong with MUI‘} ii. could rain
so iillli there would be too much
Iin siiiiill lctlcrsi. the speakers could
J” not loriiiuiiis. or ii“ of the Jun-
iors could refuse to come. Then at
'1 pin. Potter could bi‘llt llic Pogos
.|ilii iiiusi- :i certain “old soldicr" to
ill! bii. k to iill‘ coll course. Let's face
ii. fellows. iin iivcriiizc ago of 2:3 is
noiiiiiiu in siiccxc iii. Bless you.

I lhiiik Iiiiit attention should be
drawn to ii particular action which
supposedly look iiiili‘i‘ last weekend.
A km on it pol'i'ii is worth two nirv-
wlicri' l'l.\(’. especially where diiics

I‘ve heard of sowing wild oats,
figuratiVely. but not on Dorm Field,
literally. Rumor has it that gradua-
tion this year will take place on a
rich green blanket of something that
will grow faster than grass. Lotsa
luck!

Well, this is “so long" until next

is the last issue for the year. I’ve

finding it difficult to unearth suf-
ficient material fit for publication

rest and relaxation so that you’ll
