AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA‘

By LEE UPCRAF’I‘

In the light of recent un’avor-
able publicity in which a very small
minority of our student body was
involved, and also as a result of the
actions of some students at the tra-
ditional Greek weekends, the ad-
ministration, seine of the faculty,
and a few students have become
alarmed at the way they refer to
as a general lowering of the “stand—
ards” or “sense of values” at this
college.

The question seems to be what. if
anything, should be done in an at-
tempt to develop a more mature
sense of values among the student
body.

Last year's Myskania seemed to
sense this general trend and at-
tempted to take action through :
statement of ambiguous. lofty ideals
known collectively as the "Code of
Honor."

Some peope seem to feel that.
using this code as a basis, more
:qieril‘ic and extensive standards
might. be established, either by Mys-
kunia itself or some other supposed-
ly representative group. I do not
believe this solution philosophically
sound or realisticly enforceable.

Because of the size and varied
background of our student body and
faculty. 1 teel that any truly repre-
sentative reflections of standards
would be impossible. I have no
doubt, however, that a selected
ioup o: students. faculty, and ad—
Z.illii:~ll'ztlltill could advise a set, of
p. t tttc Sliiiltlill'tls and could be rel—
ant-.y successful in tnforeiug them.

But would this set of standards,
only paitially enforced. really hit at

the crux of the problem? Would this
action not in fact hinder the de-
velopment of a more mature sense
of values; because, these open actions
not now defined as acceptable would
be harder to detect and also because
some students would defy the rules
just for “kicks.”

I feel a more realistic approach
to this problem is on an individual
basis. Just as each individual's ad-
justment to college life and eventu-
ally to the teaching profession fol-
lows a. different course, so must the
solution to problems of this adjust-
ment. be unique for each individual

.-\ stereotyped solution as is sug-
gested by a more specific set of
standards to attempt to handle all
problems is not the answer. But an
expanded student personnel pro-
gram beginning with individual
counseling by qualified, trainer!
cotniSellors at, the, freshmen level
might resolve some adjustment
problems before they become too
serious.

Prevention. not regulation, is the
kcv to this problem, Not iintil the

Fashions at State have not
changed much since the Distribu-
tive Education Departmentt Coin-
merce 24 taught by Mr. Reno S.
Knouse, Professor of Merchandis-
ing‘l conducted its "Gallup" style
poll of the apparel of college stu-
dents in May 1959.

The average State student is
a fairly conservative dresser, but
there is greater variety in the cloth-
ing worn by the weaker sex than
among the men.

Joe College still presents a neat
and quiet picture this May. He pre-
fers a long-sleeved print sports shirt
with cuffs turned up twice. A good

slecved sports shirts, both plain and
printed.

These blouses usually have roll-up
sleeves or are over—blouses. They
are almost always either white or
pink in color. or the ever-increasing
pasley prints. The skirts are pre-
dominantly strai'.-.ht in style, with
black the most popular color.

The handle bags, usually of Ital-
ian leather or straw, appear to out-
shine the other styles of handbags.
The most popular is leather in nat-
