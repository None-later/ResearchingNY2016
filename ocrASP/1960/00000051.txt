Senate . . .

$1500 Loan

The radio group has asked for a
loan of from twelve to fifteen hun-
dred dollars, to be paid back month-
ly, as the station will be a profit
making venture. Senate will decide
on the appropriation of funds early
in September and the station could
be in operation sometime after
Thanksgiving.

Primer Staff Stunned

Primer budget was untabled and
discussed. It will come out the last
day of school—maybe. In the last
few years, interest in Primer has de-
clined and many copies are thrown
away.

The Senators oﬂ'ered S.A. money to
Primer right and left, so the quality
of our magazine can be improved.
Is it now a policy for Senate to cram
money down the throats of everyone
entering the Private Dining Room?
The representatives of Primer were
so amazed at the offer of money
that they were stunned. Shouldn't
proof of organizational ability, pub-
licity, progress and student interest
be proved before money is appropri-
ated? After all it took Primer rep-
resentatives two weeks to show up
at Senate meeting.

The Athletic Pool Budget was
passed. This pool will contain the
equipment of WAA, AMIA and Out-
ing Club.

One hundred forty dollars was ap-
propriated from surplus to pay for
the now famous Draper Lounge cur~
tains.

Senate has voted to change insur-
ance companies. Federal Life and
Casualty (our present company) is
losing money and wants to raise its
prices. We would pay $22.25 for nine
months; $27.75 for twelve months.
The new company will be Ameri-
can Casualty Company; 51850 for
nine months and $26.00 for twelve
months. There will be no change in
benefits.

How do the Senators who leave the
meeting to obtain liquid refreshment
know what’s going on????

It is unfortunate that, in our out-
side activities, each member of the
student body is regarded as fair
game for the rank exploitation of
certain uninformed scandal mon-
gers.

Any offenders of the social order,
no matter what their age or group-
ing, represent a very minute per-
centage of the populace. In this, as
in all they do, they retain their sta-
tus as individual human beings;
hence, none has the right to blemish
so superficially the record of the
individual or the group (in the man-
ner which has been only too woe-
fully prevalent in the past).

We ( the student body) are appar-
ently regarded as a defenseless min-
ority whose lot it is to be snidely
sniped at by the local press with-
out any fear of retaliation or re—
prisai. In his doings away from the
school, the student does not repre-
sent the school, its student body, or
his member-group within the school.

It is imperative, then, for our own
protection, as well as that of the
school, that we receive some meas-
ure of relief from these violators
of all the rules of honest and decent
(responsible) behaviour.

On the other hand: We do not
exist in a vacuum. We are not a
group of some two thousand-odd
students living as a unique entity
divorced from the rules which are
followed by those living in the area
around us. The phrase: “Remember
who you are, and what you repre-
sent.” $, perhaps corny and over
worked. However, in this'instance,
l; is all too poignantly true.

Certainly some of our mistakes
are greatly exaggerated and over
emphasized. If need be, then, in
(and because of) our position, we
must conduct ourselves in a manner
which will be above reproach; even
to those who have victimized us so
unjustly in the past.

Notice

June Alexander, Senior class
songleader, requests that all
Seniors line up 15 minutes earl-
ier than was previously an-
nounced for Moving Up Day
exercises. This request was made
to provide time for rehearsal of
the Senior Farewell Song.

Rhoda Levin wishes to. re-
mind Seniors to check the Sen-
ior Bulletin Board for informa-
tion concerning the Torch
Night Skit.

Ate Yéu ?

Take a look at this ink blot. Dehibit yourself. What
do you see? If you see your last blind date in it, we
sympathize. Because it looks like a lobster to us.

Of course we're crazy about lobsters, but we don't
like to take them out. What we do like to take out
are L” M filler cigarettes. They're the ones with flavor.
Fact is, UM has found the secret that unlocks flavor
in a filter cigarette. 80 fine tobaccos can be blended
not to suit a filter but to suit your taste. We just
mention this. If we didn’t, who would?
