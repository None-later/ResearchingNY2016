ALBANY. NEW YORK. FRIDAY. SEPTEMBER 30, 1960

VOL. XLV. NO. I7

 

The following report is based on
news articles taken from the. Times
Union and the. Knickerbocker News
of the past week.

New Campus Site

“Either the State University Col-
lege at Albany will expand to the
Albany Country Club site, or the col-
lege including existing facilities, will
be moved out of the city. There is
no alternative in Albany.”

This quote taken from the Times
Union last week sums up the recent
and heated controversy over the ex-
pansion of the State University’s
campus.

“No Alternative“

The Governor has made it clear
that there is no alternative. He said
recently that, “ . . . the state would
move the college lock, stock and bar-
rel out of tin city." This would oc-
cur ii the city refused to co-opcriitc
with the Governor's plan.

Rockefeller IssuesUltimatum
Concerning New Campus

the country club site for reasons of
transportation, and accessibility is
the only one suitable in the develop-
ment of the site.

No Delay

Mr. Rockefeller also commented,
“When I came here there was a
very serious need for new space. We
can‘t get maximum cf‘ficienty from
government with existing space, or
with old structures."

This comment was made in refer-
ence to the City developing a "Mas-
tcr Plan" which would aid middle
income housing and the relocation of
new state building's.

Expansion Planned

Rockefeller has in mind a broader
plan for a liberal arts program. He
has said that. “, . , eventually the
Albany institution should include a
liberal arts college and a giaduatc
school in public administration as
well .is its teacher training iarilitics.
