‘Tight' Senators Discuss

Dippikili, Red

PED Budget

By ELAINE RO MA’I‘OWSKI

The ﬁrst Senate meeting of the
term was called to order at 7:30 pm.
on Wednesday. September 28. 1060
amidst the roar of trash spirit. that.
poured through the open windows
of Eru dining room.

The first. discussion initiated was
(oncei‘lietl with replacement elec—
tions for two senators. Although
appointing these replacements would
be much easier. Senate apparently
remembers when its predecessor had
its fingers burned over a similar
decision.

The budget of the State (‘ollcgc
News was the next item on the
agenda. After several minutes of
confusing facts and figures. Senate
finally decided that the News will
be able to keep the addressograph
that has been collecting storage
charges all summer after a bill is
made up and passed containing sev—
eral complicated stipulations.

Problems of the publications shif-
ted ll'Iilll the News i‘l the l’cdag‘ognc.
and the moans and groans which
followed President Robinson's first
sentence ai'c certainly understand-
able. As it result of some sort of
mistake. most likely concerned with
bookkeeping. the l’cdagogue is some

$3000 in the red. The facts concern-
ing' this ridiculous situation are far
too complicated to explain at this
point. however there is no need for
alarm. The money only has to be
taken from surplus to be given back
in surplus. Simple. isn't it,‘?!!
Vice-president Byron explained a
plan she has evolved which would
alteinpi. to include more of the iii—
terestcd students in some phase
connected with student government.
I'Ier proposal revolves around ilie
formation of committees which
would investigate various problem
areas on which Senate hasn't illlll‘
to do extensive research. These ('(illl-
miiiees would then report their
findings back to Senate which would
initiate action when necessary.
The topic of Camp Dippikill oc—
cupied the last few iiiiiitites of the
meeting. According to the latest rc-
porl. the camp is at the closest it's
ever been to having something done
the plans and the money are ready
to be used. IBut “almost” doc;n'i

Albany‘s ﬁnest. (I've noticed that
they're not even Delsey.) And isn't
it wonderful the way the classes
are organized this year? Over-
crowdcd classrooms can be tolerated.
but three girls at 600 apiece a year
in a five by ten room with one
closet. two desks. and three waste
paper baskets is asking a little too
much. Maybe after soccer season
we can put the barracks back on
Vet's ﬁeld.

It‘s a terrible thing to flaunt such
a negative attitude before the fin-
i ressionablc minds of our idealistic.

the ratio in the new class is 5 to 2.
like how can any purple and gold-

I woud like to change the mood
at this point and make at least one
positive statement The All College
Reception held last Saturday was
the finest and most talent-ﬁlled that
these eyes have witnessed in the
past four years. iCongrats to the
chairmculi It seems unfortunate
that the same can‘t be said for the
(lance that followed. There seemed
to be several essentials lacking: tip-
crclassmcn. ventilation. and audible
music.

Just to prove that I‘m not really
a bad sort. and that there really is
some good in this world. I shall now
ilug [enthusiasicallyi the following
worthwhile causes:

Rivalry. which. from all reports.

much-needed journalism class which
our dedicated editor has initiated
