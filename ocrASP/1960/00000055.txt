Group presents Three (Joins in the
Fountain, a Twentieth Century-Fox
film in Cinemascope and color. Ad-

Three Coins in the Fountain is the

adventures involving their attempts
to corner husbands makes this film
one of the most humorous and ro-
mantic films ever produced.

The problems of the three girls
are numerous. Jean Peters as a crisp
and cool type who is about to chuck
her job falls for an Italian played by
Rossano Brazzi. Maggie McNamara
as a wide-eyed maiden gets her
hooks into an Italian prince played
by Louis Jourdan. Dorothy McGuire
as a loyal patient secretary of an ex-
patriate author, Clifton Webb, even
wangles this unlikely lover into pop-
ping the question to her.

Scholarships for Cooper'sConvocationSpeech
Emphasizes Albany's Future

Grads Remain

The Institute of International
Education reports that applications
for prospective applicants of 800
Fulbright scholarships for graduate
study or research in 30 countries,
are being accepted until November 1,
1960.

Inter-American Cultural Conven-
tion awards for study in 17 Latin
American countries have the same
filing deadline.

Recipients of Fulbright awards for
study in Europe, Latin America, and
the Asia-Pacific area will receive
tuition, maintenance and round-trip
travel. IACC scholarships cover
transportation, tuition, and partial
maintenance costs. IIE administra-
ters both of these student programs
for the U. S. Department of State.

General eligibility requirements
for both categories of awards are:
ll) U. S. citizenship at time of ap«
plication; 12) a bachelor’s degree or
its equivalent by 1961; (3) knowledge
of the language of the host country;
and 141 good health. A demonstrated
capacity for independent study and
a good academic record are also ex—
pected. Preference is given to appli-
cants under 35 years of age who
have not previously lived or studied
abroad.

Applicants will be required to sub-
mit a plan of proposed study that
can be carried out profitably within
the year abroad. Successful candi—
dates are required to be affiliated
with approved institutions of higher
learning abroad.

Enrolled students at a college or
university should consult the camp—
up Fulbright adviser for information
and applications, Others may write
to the Information and Counseling
Division, Institute of International
Education, 1 East 67th Street, New
York 21, New York or to any of
IIE‘s regional offices.

Requests for application forms
must be postmarked before October
15. Completed applications must be
submitted by November 1.

(Editors note: Dr. Herman Cooper,
Dean of New York State ’l‘eachcrs'
College. dellvvercd the following
speech at the Opening Convocm'of‘
Wednesday, September 21. 1960- "'5
speech concerns the future of Al-
bany State.)

The future of the College of Edn-
cation at Albany is a major concern
of the Trustees of State University.
It is one of the 23 state-operated
units of the University. In addition.
there are five contract colleges and
20 locally sponsored two-year col-
leges which are under the general
supervision of State University.
State University was created by the
Legislature of 1948 to be responsible
for the planning, supervision and
administration of facilities and pro-
visions for higher education sup-
ported in whole or in part with State
money. The powers and duties as-
signed to the State University Trus-
tees relate to planning and to ad-
ministration. I am here this after-
noon to discuss the planning func-
tions of the Trustees as they relate
to the College of Education at Al—
bany.

Major Responsibility

State University of New York is
the largest publicly suported de-ccn-
tralized university in this country.
The strength of State University to
t large extent depends upon the
character and quality of State-op—
ci‘alcd units which are located in
every section of the State. A major
responsibility of the Trustees is to
so plan for the future that low cost
higher educational opportunities
will be available to every talented
youth who has demonstrated his
ability to pursue some form of high-
er cducation. No state can afford to
deny talented youth an opportunity
Lu pursue advanced specialized and
professional studies which will qual-
ify ‘him for a position of leadership
in its society.

Enough Room?
The office I represent has pro-

jected enrollments for the colleges
of education through the fall of 1965.
At that time it is anticipated that
the eleven colleges of education will
have in attendence 25,000 full-time
regular session students pursuing
studies which will qualify them for a
teaching position in the public
schools: 3.200 of this number should
be enrolled in Albany State pro-
vided suitable classroom space can
be found for the instruction of such
students. The planning and develop-
ment. of this college has lagged far
behind the other colleges of educa-
tion because of the site situation. It
is my undcrstunding that this prob-
lem will soon be resolved.

The present classroom facilitics at
this college cannot provide instruc-
tion for existing enrollments. Many
able and qualified students who dc-
sirc to prepare for secondary school
teaching positions but who cannot
afford to attend private collciu's
arc dcnicd an opportunity to attcnd
this college.

Graduate \Vork

Thc cnrolhncnts referred to rc-
liitc only to teacher education pro-
grams. This is the one colich of
cdu-ation which now offers iiiIli
year regular session study leading
t a the masters degree; the other tcn
colleges offer such study in late ail —
crnoon. evening. Saturday morning
and summer session. In :i(l(Illl(iil,
State University Trustees. with the
approval of the Regents, have auth—
orized graduate studies lending to
the doctors degree. The initial pro—
erains will be for teachers and ad—
ministrators residing in this area.
This has been the only area of the
State in which such a doctoral pro—
griim has not previously existed.

Liberal Arts Program?

The Trustees, with the approval
of the Regents, have already author-
ized upper level advanced study in
the liberal arts for qualified two-
year graduates of community col-
leges residing in the regions scrvcd
