ISC Releases
Rushing Rules

Elaine Zipper ’61, President of
Inter-sorority Council, has released
the rushing rules according to the
ISC constitution.

A. All rushing will be deferred
until Saturday, October 15, at 7 am.
Any rushing prior to this time will
be considered an infraction by ISC.
These rules to which sorority pledges,
inactives and alumnae are subject
shall be in effect until the time of
the first regular pledge service fol-
lowing entrance.

B. In any discussion of sorority
matters, a sorority may speak of no
sorority except her own.

C. No money is to be spent on
rushees either by sororities or soror-
ity members, except for the money
spent on parties referred to in the
Code.

D. With the exception of the
events listed in the schedule of
events after the beginning of rush-
ing, sororities or members of soror-
ities shall not entertain freshmen.

The remaining rushing rules will
be published in next week’s issue.

Cooper's Speech...

(Continued from Page 1,, Column 5)
by the Colleges of Education at Fre-
donia and at New Paitz. It is anti-
cipated that there will be far great-
er demand for such advanced study
in the years ahead. This is one of
the centers that is best equipped to
serve such a demand of qualified
transfer students from our commun-
ity colleges.

This college needs from 150 to 200
acres to provide the projected facili-
ties needed to serve the undergrad-
uates and graduate enrollments. En-
rollment goals projected for this
coile;e can be attained only if such
a site is acquired and suitable build-
ings are erected.

Broader Program Needed

No institution of higher educa-
tion, general or professional. is ex-
empt from the obligation of doing all
it can to produce well rounded citi-
;'ens who are equipped to play a
leadership role in our society. Gen-
crul or liberal arts education should
be basic to the preparation of every
person qualifying for professional
Icensure. I have always held the
view that every teacher should be
required to complete a broad pro-
gram in liberal arts education in
addition to the program of speciali-
zation which is necessary for the
scholarly mastery of both content
and professional study in his chosen
field of teaching. A liberal arts edu-
cation should buttress every program
of teaching education. Every course
in a college of education should be
so planned by faculties that the com
tent is a true challenge to the best
intellectual efforts of every student
privileged to prepare for teaching.

It is my firm belief that under the ~

leadership of the Trustees of State
University the colleges of education
will have the instructional staffs and
facilities that will challenge the best
efforts of qualified students who are
chosen to prepare for teaching. It
is my conviction that in our way of
life those who choose teaching as a
career make a greater contribution
to our future than any othcr group
of citi/.cns. The colleges serving the
needs of future teachers should be
of the highest caliber in this State.
