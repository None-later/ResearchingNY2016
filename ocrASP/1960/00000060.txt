APA Ends Potter Domination
B Downs SLS in Thriller

The opening game of the AMIA
football season pitted the men from
Waterbury against a strong-lined
Madmen team.

Receiving the kickoff Waterbury's
offense bogged down and the Mad-
men took over deep in Men's terri-
tory. They moved the ball down to
the three yard line where the strong
line play of Phil Shepard. Lee Up-
craft and Tony Maealusa thwarted
a scoring threat.

Electing to move the ball from
their own territory, Men's opened
with a left end sweep. On the play
halfback Dave Stickney was trapped
in the end zone by hard rushing
Jack Pohida for a two point safety.

For a major part of the first half
the game was played between the
thirty yard stripes. Just before the
half ended Camarata hit halfback
Bill Hayes for the winning touch-
down. The game ended. a six to two
.'ictory for Men‘s.

A tough APA football team sent
Potter Club reeling to their ﬁrst
defeat in ﬁve years when the Blue
and White came up with seven
points in the second quarter and
managed to hold on to a 7-2 lead.

Potter Strikes First

With APA punting on its ﬁrst
series of downs, Jim Dougherty
dropped the pass from center re-
sulting in a safety as Potter's Ed
Brennen picked up the loose ball
in the end—zone.

AI’A Starts to Roll

Early in the second quarter Bob
Pollero, Bill Burnett, Chuck Hun—
ter, Dave Janick, Jack But-halter
and Jim Dougherty got the APA
passing offense together and start-
ed to click. Oncc slowed down and
forced into punting situation, a fake
punt play was called and Bob Pol—
iero grabbed Burnett’s pass and
raced 55 yaids for the score that
was to win the game. Jack Buchal-
tcr made ihi- play click with his
triimi-ndou. block of thc Potter
safety man.

its first game Wednesday afternoon
by another strong KB team.

Kappa Beta moved the ball over
100 yards on offense in the ﬁrst
quarter as quarterback Jim Warner,
hit fullback Joe Gilbert. halfback
Gary Lynch, and end Andy Cibul-
sky.

In the second period KB's twin
Speedster ends look over. Sherwin
"Bones" Bowen intercepted an SLS
pass on the KB 30 thown by quar-
terback George Anestes. Bowen
raced around the left side for 60
yards for the TD.

The tremendous line play of the
two teams continued throughout. the
game. Pete Spina and Jack Galla-
gher in the line, and Gary Sabin
and Gary Jones blocking in the
backﬁeld were outstanding for SLS.

In the third quarter the other
half of the speed pair at ends for
KB. Andy Cibulsky, grabbed an SLS
punt on the KB 15 and ran 75 yards
through the entire SLS defense. Jim
Warner ran around end for the con-
version and the score was 13-0.

In the last quarter a 60 yard pass
from Jim Hanlon to George Aiiestes
scored the SL5 touchdown.

Frosh Take
Softball, 6-5

By LEONARD COUSINEAU

Saturday morning the Sophs rol-
led over the frosh in a little game
called Pushball.

However, in softball that after-
noon, it was a different story with
the frosh winning 6-5.

Field play, pitching. and power
were the keynotes of the frosh win.
The inﬁeld was a well built machine.
The outfield had to have more than
a little luck to snag all those fly
balls.

Kirkey, frosh pitcher, had more
than one jam to get out of. In the
second inning he was threatened
with a. bases loaded, one out situa-
tion. He preceded to strike out one
man and get the other to ground
out. A fifth inning home run by
Moore and a two-run triple by Gruol
illustrated some freshman power.
Every frosh had at least one hit to
his credit proving once again that
the game was an all around effort.
The last inning was indeed exciting.

As Sutherland Sees It

Frosh Could Go All the Way,
State's Boofers on the Way Up

By MEET SUTHERLAND

Fall is fallen-. From deep down
in the Quad the cry of the lost souls
of Rivalry are heard. Their voices
boom out and little work can be
carried on at the Sports desk. At
last, things are normal.

Congratulations to Joe Garcia.
Frank Fallace, Gary Penfleld and
company in their 6-0 victory Satur-
day.

Jiist got the news from the Reser-
vation. “Case of the Indians vs. the
Chiefs." Teepee wasn’t big enough
to hold the massive center.

APA's victory over EEP looks like
the league will be wide open for
anyone to win this year. Don't
count anyone out yet.

The freshmen softball team look-

ed like a. league winner Saturday.

If the Sophs had had one more hit-

ter like Mike Camarotta, (3-4), it

could have been a different story.

Geneseo 6-0

State's soccer team boards the
bus today at 4 pm. and rolls south-
ward to meet Adelphi in battle on
Saturday at 2 pm. They left a
thoroughly churned up Geneseo
team. and a shaken up RPI. team.
in the wake of this past week’s drive.

Geneseo left here a very subdued
team. after a well organized Ped
offense tallied six goals. and a rock
hard Stale defense shutout their
opponents attack. It was a fine team
effort all the way, with everyone
up for the game. Goals were booted
by Frank Fallace with four. and
John Woyawitch and Mack Jessup
with one apiece. Ed Broomfield and
Ron Coslick each had two assists,
while Joe Hickey added one to the
rccord.

On Wednesday. State met a cocky
and confident RPI, team Coach
(Iarcia‘s cfforls had the boys up for
this game also, and they wanted
badly to avenge last years 3-1 de—
fciit on the R.P.I. home grounds.

The Peds played good ball during
lhc first half, but did not give the
performance lhcy were known to be
capable of. It was only through the
spcctacular play of goalie Gary Pen-
flcld that llicrc wasn't a score for
RPI. After nine minutes of the
lliird quarter, the Engineers scorcd
on a (‘ltl‘lli'l‘ kick. and llllllgs looked
black for thc home team.

But ihis is a Ii‘lllll of great spirit,
and thcy came roaring back to the
attack. Midway through the third
period the PM offense Iclled and
they dominach the play. With three
minutes left in tlic pcriod. Karl Ger-
sicnbcrgcr tallied on an assist froin
Frank Fallacc to tic ilic score. Dur-
ing the final quarter, the State of-
f'i-iisc attacked with determined spir-
it. and outplayed the firing Visitors.
With llli‘ score iicd. the game went
iiilo ovcrtiinc, but nciihcr side could
pi-uclraic thc ncts a second time. It
was with rcspi-cl and adiiiii'atlon for
each other Iliui both [cams left the
