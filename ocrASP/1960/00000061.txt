Rivalry Sing, Bonfire Tonight SUCEA Starts
PreludeAnnualHomecoming Ed. D. Degree

The Rivalry Sing will take place
this evening at 7:30 pm. on Dorm
Field as the freshmen and Sopho-
mores vie for the tWo Rivalry points
at stake. The sing is the weekend's
single Rivalry event, and it is a
prelude to the annual Homecoming
festivities. A bonfire and rally fol—
low the sing on Beverwyck Field.

Three Songs

Three songs will be sung by each
class. They include a class fight
song, a song to welcome the oppos-
ing class, and an alma mater. Lyrics
for each song will be original; how-
ever the tunes for the fight song
and the welcome do not have to
be original. Irene Ecoiioinopoiilos ’63
and Terrie Cutler '64 are the two
cl.iss soiigleaders for the event.

Sophs Lead

The Rivalry score now stands at
8-2 in favor of the Sophomores. As
a result of last Saturday‘s events,
the Soplis broke the 2-2 deadlock
when they picked up six Rivalry
points. Two points were won for the
in. rning's Banner l-lunt, two for
boys‘ football and two for girls' vol-
leyball. The present. score, however.
cannot be considered indicative of
the final outcome since three cheer-
lll‘J,‘ points. tlll'i't' newspaper points

and five skit points are withheld
until Campus Night.

Committee Decision

The Rivalry Committee has decid-
ed that if the Sophmnores are the
winners of the sing this evening. the
two debate points will also be with—
held until Campus Night. The rea-
son for this decision is that it is
conceivable that the winner of Riv-
alry could be known before Carinpiis
Night. This could happen if the
Sophomores are winners of the de-
bate, the sing and the tug—of-war,
the only three remaining events pri-
or to November 12.

Welcome

Back from the. wide, wide
world stream State‘s illustrious
alumni for their animal weekend
journey into the past. It is their
privilege this weekend to relive
the carefree memories of their
student days; it is their time for
rejuvenation, reminiscence, and
rcvelry. ()ld friends meet, old
enemies becoiile new friends, and
“apathy” becomes only a word
in the. dictionary.

We aii'e proud of our alumni
and we hope that this weekend
will make them equally proud
of us.

Of course. State l'nivcrsity of
New York (‘ollegc of Education

crably from the Albany Stale
