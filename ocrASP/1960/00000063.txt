Adams State and RPI

After a 10-2 trounclng at the
hands of Orange County Community
College. Bob Burlingame's frosh
soccer team now has a two game
winning streak.

Frosh Win

Last Saturday they defeated North
Adams State Teachers College, 4-1,
and on Wednesday upset the RPI
frosh by a score of 1-0.

The winning goal in the RPI game
was scored in the last two minutes
of play by Erwin Siemon. the State
left inside.

RPI Outplayed

The score. however. does not show
credit that RPI was outplayed
throughout the whole game.

Siemon, DiCaprio Outstanding

The leading scorer on the team is
Siemon, an Albany High graduate.
who has booted in 3 goals and as-
sisted on another.

Al DiCaprio. the speedy and voci-
ferous left wing, has two goals and
one assist on the season.

Bob Seaman. the tall. rangy half-
back. is indispensable to the team
on defense.

Goalie Bill Votinoska. who has al-
lowed only 5 goals and has a shutout

As Sutherland. Sees It

Alumni are Coming

Home

 

By MERT SUTIIERLAND

I want to thank Captain Merle
Miller of the soccer team for his
columns of the past two weeks about
the Fed games. It just goes to show
you that the soccer team elected
a Captain who is always ready to
help out in any way that he can.
A pie-season injury which has kept.
him out of the lineup so far is ill-
inost healed and the big-toed de—
fenscman is almost ready to go.

Homecoming

I overheard a freshman the other
day asking about Homecoming.
What is it and why does ever “Up-
pcrclassniun” talk about it in a cer-
tnin undertone.

It means different things to dif—
ferent people. It means that your
Luddies, grads. roommates, and
girlfriends are coming buck to
school. Fraternity brothers and Sor-
ority sisters ('tilillllL‘. back for one
last fling, It means that the any
Cohcn you played with on the team

buck to make sure that it I)lL:‘.:t‘l' one
will be won this year.

They‘re Here

The Alumni are coming. People
you sweated over exams Will]. and
girls who raised the "curves" in the
classes you failed. "God bless cm,"

You can't forget the beer parties
and the dances and the rivalry with
that certain person who said he
could put you under the table.

nctcr studied. or wont to class. and

STATE COLLEGE NEWS FRIDAY. OCTOBER 14. 1960

Kappa Bela Wins Over APA,‘
Waterbury Upsets SIS, 6-0

Evenly Matched League

Prospects in the AMIA league for
a three or four way tie is very pos-
sible. Every team seems capable of
beating the other. Waterbury and
Kappa Beta are the only teams left
undefeated and both have the
heavier part of their schedule left.
Alpha Pi Alpha and Potter Club
have both been beaten only once
and it is going to take a tremen-
dous effort on the part of any team
to take the title.

KB Wins

In the big game of the week KB
downed APA in another light one
2-0. It was a case of APA‘s speed
against KB's power.

Each team lost scoring opportuni-
ties. APA was twice inside the KB
15 yard line and KB had two touch-
downs called buck. plus :1 loss of lhc
bail on the APA oiic yard line.

Defensive Game

Except for a couple of long puss
completions thrown by both sides
the game vvas primarily a defensive
one.

KB could no run around APA's
defensive ends, [‘ed Ditsciicnko. and
Jack But-halter. KB‘s iinc. lcd bv
200 pounders Tom Ellis. Joe (ilIIJL'l'I.
Ed Walsh. and Dick O'Coiiiioi'brokc

the game to iiiaikc (Quarterback Bill
Burnett hurry his throws.

Safety Scored

The lone score of the game “'iln
set up by a bad APA pass from cen—
ter which rolch to the APA one.
On the next play Stt-yc Condogcni
dove throiizzh and tagged the Quar-
terback iii the End Zone. The Safety
proved to be the game.

Speed Against Power

APA's speed in the bilt'klll'ltl was

a factor throughout the ciitircguiiic.

Even though KB's quarterback Jim
Warner had time to throw the ball.
his receivers were covered more than
adequately by the APA line backers.

Jerry Mitchell. Ellis, and Ed Min-
out) were outstanding on the offen-
sive line for KB. 208 lb. Jeff Sohns.
and 225 lb. Jerry Ccrne were out-
standing oii the APA line.

It was just a case of too many
big mcn in the KB line for APA's
rock-ribbed line to hold.

Waterbury Upsets SLS

Waterbury Hall pulled one of the
bigzcst upsets of the season in
downing SLS 6-0. The gameness of
the Men's dorin teniii .sccmcd to be
the only thing that saved them from
SLS touchdowns time after time.

Line ()utwcighed

'l‘hc heavier SLS line outweighed
the Dorm team‘s line by 20 pounds
[it'l‘ man. but the smaller line played
them even throughout the game.

In Illl‘ first half Mike Cuinui'otla

stored the only touchdown of the
game in the second quarter.

State Pedmen Ouiboot Adelphi,
Face Oswego in Homecoming Game

By MERLE MILLER

Last Saturday, State’s soccer team turned back an eager, aggressive, but inexperi-
enced squad at Adelphi. The Purple and Gold showed flashes of the inspired play they
are known to be capable of, but for most of the game they lapsed back to the type of un-
coordinated game their opponents showed. This can possibly be traced to the fact that
the starting line was revamped because many starters were unable to play. Another rea-
son for the below average play, is that it was natural to experience a letdown after the
terrific game played against RPI earlier in the week.

SOME GOOD SIGNS

Not all was bad in the eyes of Coach Garcia. though. Lou Wolner continued his
steady improvement and played a good contest. Years of hard practice have paid off for
Lou and he has developed into a fine fullback this year.
Jack Maransville also came off the bench to show a large
gain in skill since the beginning of the year. Frank Fal-
lace played an outstanding team game, and also scored
three goals to turn in the hat trick again.

CHANCE FOR A TITLE

team at State. State doesn't givc
out athletic scholarships. so every—
one has an equal chance to make
the team.

The next time you see a player
come into the game. think of all
the time he spends doing a job
which only the best gain credit for,
but which he must do to help the
team and the school.

Big Game

The biggest game of the year will
be played here Saturday against the
Osng State booters' highly tal—
ench team.

Last year State spectators filled
up one side of Blocker Stadium.
This year there will be an even big—
ger State audience at the new field.
"The one with the invisible bieech-
crs." So you'd better get there early
it you want to see the game. Yes
sir, there will be standing room only
at this game. That‘s my prediction
for the week. No one can do much
t‘xt'ulil stand. unless you are allowed
to .sit on the players' bench.
