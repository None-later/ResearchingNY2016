AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.‘

By THE REALIST

Dearly beloved freshmen,

You have left your families (sob),
your home town friends, and have
entered Albany State, an immense
conglomeration of pseudo characters,
optimistic Seniors, rah-rah gung-ho
hypocrites, and pedantic teachers.
There is still time for you to es-
cape. You can either transfer to a
decent college or write to Oedipus,
who will be more than pleased to
help you adjust yourself to this
drunken rat race kind of life which
we lead here.

You have been told that for every
one of you accepted three have been
rejected. This statistic is entirely
correct; however, may I point out
t at you were never told the quality
of those that were not accepted.
Therefore you are being compared
to nothing, which is an utterly
stupid concept; but then again. this
is college and “ours is not to reason
why, our is but to do and die."

Your level of personality has been

accurately determined by such
philosophical questions as:
Do you ( ) Have you t ) hated

your mother (check one). Do you
count cracks in the sidewalk as you
walk? Yes ( ) Nof ). (By the way,
if you do, there are 238 cracks from
Ontario to Quail on the Washington
Tavern side of Western Avenue, I
was told by one of my pedagogical
friends.)

Do you feel someone is trying to
poison you? Yes i ) Nof ). (If you
answered yes to the previous ques-
tion. you fall into the category of a
normal student—one who believes
the teachers are trying to poison
his inlnd.)

Members of the class of 1964. you
are undergoing a period in your life
commonly called Orientation. This
process is composed of many worth-
while phases such as lighting cigar-
ettes for upperclassmen. attending
a meeting once a week, singing
songs upon request, and mnning
around with an idiotic head gar—
ment. Do not miirk, lowly freshmen,
for throughout your four years, you

yourself for the teaching profession.
I have, and let me tell you, I have
never been so satisfied with myself.

Well, that's enough philosophical
wisdom for one issue. I sincerely

Dean, he’ll settle things OUT for
you.

WEEKEND”

 

Views of
Denmark

By MAR.- Y LOU GALLAGHER

One important day that all of the
American Experimenters and Dan-
ish families never spoke of was the
day of parting. In just two months,
ten Americans had become a real
part of ten Danish families, and all
our thoughts and feelings culminat-
ed in the last good bye.

The scene at the Copenhagen
railway station is one that will al-
ways remain with me. Mother, Fa-
ther, and Winnie were standing
together trying to smile and tell me
the last bits of news. My cousins.
the Plambecs, had arrived in all the
confusion that only four Danish
sisters can create, and Knud and
Eric, two of my closest Danish
friends. were present. Besides this
little group, the families of two oth-
er Americans were represented. Ev-
eryone was talking at once know-
ing that these were our last words
together. Someone produced flow-
ers for we three voyagers and the
boys carried our twelve pieces of
luggage onto the train. I finally as—
sured Mother that nine sandwiches,
oranges, and soda would last until
we reached Paris. Then, far down
the platform, the conductor's whistle
sounded. Last minute hugs and
promises of letters, and we were
aboard the train trying to smile
into the anxious faces turned up to
us. “We’ll be back," were our last
shouts as the train slowly moved out
of the stattion.

What I experienced this past
stunnier in Denmark can never be
changed or forgotten. It happened,
through all of you at State College.
This is as much your experience
as mine. The ambassador program,
new this year, will only be success-
ful if I can talk to you. and if you
are interested in listening. I thank
all of you from the bottom of my
heart, and I hope that someone
else will be able to share a similar
experience next year.

NEWS to Poll Students'
Debate; Dance National Election Choice

It’s getting to be that time again—~the time to make
that trip to the poles to express your own personal choice

concerning the candidate of your choice.

to enable students, whether or not they are of legal voting
age, to express their opinoins. The purpose of this election
is to let the students of this college know how their class-
mates feel about the presidential candidates. The News
next week will carry the results of this election.
