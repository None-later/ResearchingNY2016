Bill Burnett goes around end in APA-EEP game.

AMIA:

 

Potter Drives by KB 2-0,
Mens Out-Passes APA

The AMIA Football League con-
tinues to roll along with one upset
after the other. Undefeated Water-
bury Hall is leading the league with
Potter and KB right behind.

A number of the members of the
Waterbury team are members of the
fraternities on campus. This work-
ing together along with freshmen
and independents is one of the best
things to happen in the football
league in years.

Experience Needed

When a freshman comes to State,
he has no idea of how to organize
a team to compete in a tough AMIA
football league. It takes experience
to have a successful team in the
league. Congratulations are in order
for the men who put the Waterbury
team together. ,

EEP Wins

Potter and KB tangled in a game
Thursday which could be the key
to the title. FE? won by a 2-0 score.
The entire game was a defensive
one.

Neither team scored in the fast
half. KB and Potter had trouble
moving the ball past their own 30
yard line. Collapsing defenses and
jitterbugging linemen seemed to
have both offenses confused.

Herm Altman and Kim Gifford.
Potter's defense ends, stopped all
KB runs around the ends. Joe Gil-
bert and Tom Ellis did the same
thing to Potter.

Both quarterbacks had to hurry
their throws as neither defensive
line seemed to be able to hold the
other line. Mike itilcy threw some
nice block. lll the backfield while
protecting the Potter quarterbacks.
Joe Gilbert did the same in the KB
backfield.

Lines Play Hard

Both team.» tried but neither
seemed to be able to go any place.

vantage of a KB penalty to score

APA Scores

This past Monday one of the
“big” games was played. Once beat-
en APA played unbeaten Waterbury.

APA wasted no time in scoring.
Early in the ﬁrst quarter Jeff Sahns
put a good rush on Waterbury
quarterback Mike Camerata and
batted a pass into a teammate's
arms. This gave APA the ball on
the Waterbury 32. Three completed
passes from Bill Burnett to Bob
Pollero gave APA the touchdown.

Camerata Passes

In the second quarter Mike Cam-
erata went to work in the air and
on the ground. Passing easily be-
hind the protection of Mickovitch,
he moved the ball from his own 43
down the ﬁeld. The downfield march
started when pass interference was
called on the APA secondary on the
APA 19 yard line.

Carmerata then ran around right
end to the 14 before hitting Eric
Kafka on the l. The hard running
quarterback then ran the extra
point giving Waterbury the lead,
7-6, which it never relinquished.

APA put up its last bit of offense
in the closing moments of the first
half. Their drive was stopped on the
Waterbury 16 yard line with 53 sec—
onds left in the half.

Mickovitch (‘alchos ’l‘D

Early in the third quarter Water—
bury started downfield again from
the APA «H. Once again it was Cain-
erata setting up the score as he
skirted right end for 25 yards put-
ting the ball on the 19. The run set
the scene for two quick passes over
the middle of the line. The second
pass \\(‘llL to Mickovitch in the end
zone. The extra point was scored on
a pass to Kafka.

The rest of the game \vas featured
by tough defenses which had the
two teams exchanging punts. it was.
in one of these punts that Jerry
Miiiigcr took off on a Alb yard touch»
down run for the Waterbury score
(inci- lli'lllll the ext r a point was

Frosh Booters

Split; Lose

To Colgate, Defeat RPI

On Saturday, at Hamilton, N. Y.,
the fresh soccer team lost a heart-
breaker to the Colgate frosh in over-
time by a score of 4-2. Coach Burl-
ingame's charges regained their
winning ways on Tuesday, however,
defeating the RPI fresh 3-1.

Colgate scored in the second and
third periods, but the little Peds
came from behind in the ﬁnal quar-
ter to tie the game at 2-2 and send
it into overtime.

Scoring for State were the inside
left Erwin Siemon and the big.
bruising left half Gary Smith.

In overtime, Colgate proved too
rough and too strong for State as
they scored two goals to win it.

Defeat RPI Again

For the second time in a week.
the frosh defeated RPI's frosh.

While the ﬁrst game was a cliff-
hanger, with Siemon scoring the
only goal in the last 2 minutes,
Tuesday's game on Vets Field could
have been safely prescribed for
heart patients.

An unspirited State team scored
on an over-awed RPI at 19:30 of the

ﬁrst period, with outside left Al Di-
Caprio doing the booting.

The little Petls added two more in
the third period to wrap-up the
game. Siemon scored his ﬁrst goal
of the season and the hard—playing
inside right kicked his ﬁrst.

As Suds Secs It

Goal Tending
At State

a

   

By MER’I‘ Sl'TIIERLAND

What chalice does a player who
goes to Albany State have of be-
coming an All American‘.J State
doesn’t have a large publicity dc-
partment to plug its star athletes.
To become a “Name Athlete," a
player needs a large amount of
publicity backing.

Little Glory in the final

A goalie usually doesn‘t have as
much publicity as it player who
scores. Gary Pcnfield has little
chalice of making All American be-
cause of this hick of publicity. Those
of you who saw the game Satur—
day against Oswcgo must, have re-
alized how much the team relies on
Gary.

During the last three soccer St'il-
sons, State has had three dillerciit
goalies. None have giiiiied the con-
fidence of his teammates as Gary
has in the short. time that he has
been in the nets.

"as the Speed

Gary has the nm'essary physical
rmiiiiremeiits that make .i good
goalie. He has very strong hands,
a sprinter's speed in getting to the
ball when it is kicked. and a foot
which can kick the bull halfway
down the field on every kick.

There are a large number of
goalies who have these same quali-
ties. What seems to make him dif—

fercnt from the average goalie in
his iir:t year in the nets?

He has a driving desire to win
and to be better than the goalie in
the opposite nets. Another way of
describing this type of athlete is
“nuts.”

However. you have to go further
than this to see why Gary has galli-
ed the confidence of his teammates.
When he is driving for :1 ball in
front of the goal. he doesn‘t have
It think about the foot that just
inissc» his head or the fear of the
bull being kicked into his face. He
has trained himself to think about
nothing but stopping the opponent
from scoring.

He coll.'ellll‘litt‘s on doing the job
'Emt :l goalie must do if his team
is to be at its best. He takes it phy-
shall bczitiii': in order to win and
ncicr think.» about what may hap-
peii fill the next play.

Ile‘ll Be There

(mi-y Penlicld may never make All
.»\mcric.in. even with games like
last. Saturday's. in which he had
thirty saves. But the coach and the
players know he‘ll be making one
hell of ii. try.

Winning Year

This year the soccer teiitii has a
chance to finish near the top in
NYSISC. Next year, "WHY NOT."

S’ra’re Bea’rs New Paliz, Ties Oswego,
Pedmen Face Plalisburg Tomorrow

After soundly beating New Paltz last Thursday by a top heavy 10-0 score, State’s
Soccer team looked forward eagerly to the homecoming game with Oswego. But the
Lakers were not impressed by previous scores State had posted, and took control of the
field during the first half of the game.

Oswego was an agressive team and in fine shape, being able to consistently beat the
home team to the ball. At half time the score was 1-0 with the Feds on the bottom. Coach
Garcia fired up his boys during the break, however, and in the second half the Feds
showed their superior skill by carrying the attack to the Green and White team.

Luck was not with them, however, as they missed
1 37mm sax.

many chances to score. Finally an Oswego player was pen-
alized for the use of hands and a penaly kick was awarded
, , to State. Karl Gcrstenberger made the shot good and the
State has many lovely Sites at

The main field at the present

time is the cavernous Veterans
Field ringed by many rows of con-
crete nothings.

Vets was constructed by the school
at the cost of nearly nothing, and

form of torture known as gym

Overtime
For the second time in two weeks
the Peds played in overtime but to
no avail. This was the second l-i
tie game of the season.

Oneonta

    

Tuesday, an undermanned Purple
and Gold squad traveled to Oncon-
ta. The Garciamen had left behind
five of the starting eleven due to
injuries and other reasons. With
both goal keepers unable to play,
Dick Lewis was pressed into service.
Dick had served as goalie for the
,,,,,,,,,,,,, __ ltPl frosh team three years ago.

Dick's services were not enough
to overcome the loss of so many key
men, With reserves taking the place
of (lcrsteiiberger, Ed Broomfield,
Gary Peiifield, and Franz Zwickel—
bauer, the Albany team was like a
('l‘lplili'tl animal and Oneonta was
the relentless hunter.
