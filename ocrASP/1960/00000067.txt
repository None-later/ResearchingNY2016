D & A Council to Present Play

Dramatics and Arts Council pre-
sents State College Theatre in
Eugene O’Neill's Iceman Cometh
Friday and Saturday, October 28
and 29, in Page Hall. Due to the
length of the performance, CUR-
TAIN TIME HAS BEEN CHANG-
ED TO 7:30 p.m. The play was pre-
miered at Cornell University for
the annual New York State Coin-
munity Theatre Conference on
October 15 and was well received.

Nature ()I‘ Play
The Iceman (‘ometh is not a

pleasant or cheerful play, even

though it possesses a considerable
comic element. It is a major work
by America‘s greatest dramatist; a
play in which O’Neill does not hesi-
tate to employ strong language and
an uncompromising view of some
of the harsher realities of life in
the development of his essentially
pessimistic theme. It is not light or
casual entertainment; it is a pow-
cri'ul, disturbing drama that re-
veals ii tragic view of life.

The play is directed by Dr. Jarka
Burian assisted by Norman Kutzer
and Robert Steinliauei'. Technical
direction is by Mr. James Leonard.

"Iceman" Lauded at Ithaca

To Open at Page October 28

By ELAINE ROMATOWSKI

The State College Theatre's pro-
duction of Eugene O’Neill's The
Iceman Cometh was spectacularly
received by the theatre-goers of
Ithaca, New York, with a standing
ovation at its opening last weekend.

In Page Hall, at 7:30 p.m., on
October 28-29, the Hopes and To-
morrows of the world will again
smoke their pipe-dreams and don
their DTs as a State College audi-
eiice bears witness to a few of life's
more stirring tragedies.

The usual State College “greats”
head the cast of characters whose
dreams are temporarily frozen by
the infamous Iceman.

Ralph Smith, as Hickey, once
again makes all the stage his World
and brings the performance to an
emotional climax with his lengthy
last-act monologue.

Mariy Molson, whose role in the
Cave DWcllers last year brought
him into the spotlight, plays Joe,
the “real white" Negro, with such
complete realism that to the vie yer
he becomes one of the most pitiful
and most, convincing characters in
the entire play.

Danny Labeille ages at least forty
years into the character of the dis-
tilled iind pathetic Hugo whose
waking moments, althouin coin-
parulivcly few, are perhaps the most
moving of the production

Among the down-trodden, alco-
hol—soaked souls of Harry Hope's
bur staggers one bit of pure coni-
czly I-larry Hope himself. John
Griffin as the would-be politician
wciirs his Irish brogue as convinc—
ineg as he does his allegorical
mime—tag.

'I‘hc despair and weary resigna-
tion of "Larry," who is “afraid to
hvc and even more afraid to die,
is ably projected through the tal-
ciiis of Bruce Earl. a relative new-
('ILIICI' io Shite College Theatre.

Robert Coiigcmi, whose life as
"Parritt," Hickey’s parallel, ends

with a sickening thud, presents an
exceptionally good portrayal of the
weak-willed young traitor.

Bonnie Scott, Brenda Caswell,
and Leona Coughlin, the three
ladies of unquestionable reputation,
as well as Ken Taylor as the Dutch-
man, George Hathaway as the
Liiney, and George Cavanaugh as
Jimmy Tomorrow should also be
noted for their outstanding perfor-
mances in rather difficult roles.

The reaction of a State College
audience to an experience as pro-
found and profane as the Iceman
is questionable, especially since a
majority of the viewers will be
freshmen and their parents. Each
character is a masterpiece in itself,
and only a well-trained theatre au-
dience could be able to appreciate
the full impact of each of their
catastrophic personalities.

Congratulations to Dr. Jarka
Burian and the entire cast and staff
for a production unequalled in the
dramatic history of State Certainly
with such talent and such expert
direction available, the State Col-
Ic;e Theatre will soon be ranked
union: the top amateur theatrical
.‘,l'ollps in the State of New York.
