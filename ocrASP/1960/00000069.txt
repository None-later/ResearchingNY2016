Senate Grants News Board
AdditionalConferenceFunds

By JIM DOUGHERTY

Hofstra College President John
Adams 'lecture in Lower Brubacher
Wednesday night forced Senate to
move from its spacious Private 11n-
ing Room headquarters to the
cramped quarters of the Govern-
ment Room for another in its series
of one-hour weekly meetings.

Election Procedure

First on the agenda. was a report
by Junior Senator Dick Notting-
ham on rules governing the resig—
nation of present SA officials if
they should elect to run for the
vacated Myskania seat.

The report was indeed noncon-
clusive as Nottingham failed to re-
view any existing legislation on the
matter. Instead he merely gave
what he thought to be a reasonable
solution to the problem

Soph Senator Roy Knapp display-
ed his sharpness when he noted to
the body the seriousness of the pro-
blem and suggested that SA Pre>i
dent Robinson withhold decision un-
til an official copy of Election Com»
mission Rules can be secured.

Surplus Grant Allowed

In what was expected to be a
hotly contested issue, Senate found
within itself to subordinate its pre-
judices and objectively consider a
request for seventy dollars in addi-
tional funds by the State College
News Board. The overwhelming ar-
guments for this college being rep-
resented at the forthcoming SUNY
Press Association Conference. Geb-
hardt. should not go unnoticed. Al-
though the educational values of
the conference are minimal as com-
pared to other conferences the News
attends, the opportunity for Albany
to exert leadership in the field of
collegiate journalism is unlimited.
The State College News is the only
newspaper within the University
which is not directtly or indirectly
controlled by Admiitstrative influ-
ence.

One of the highlights of this year's
conference will be Albany’s Presi—
dent Evan R. Collins delivering an
address on the role of faculty and
administrative supervision of stit-
dent publications.

News "Stages"
Drama Feature

By BILL FRANKONIS

Basic to the act of imitation, is
the need for expression and this
is probably where we depart from
more animal mimicry. for the need
to express one‘s self outside the
realm of fundamental drives, is a
trait unique to the human being.
Yet, the area in which this expres—
sive imitation is drawn to one of
its highest. finest peaks, is one of
which we are all very much aware,
but with which only a few have a.
definite familiarity. This area is the
theater.

The Living Stage

The term theater encompasses
many forms movies. television, ra-
dio, and the stage. Of these four.
the last. being the sire of the other
three, is best held up for example
and study. Beyond its parcntl‘iood,
however, the living) stage may be
held exemplary by virtue of what
the term, "living stage," alone iridi-
cates. and that is. life; life. as felt
between actor and audience, as in-
terpreted by the director, as corn-
intinicated by the. lighting director
and set designer, But it's "on the
boards" that this life is best coin-
inunicated when that little shock
leaps from actor to audience and
back, in the realization that both
are very much alive, both very much
present.

. and its heritage

The Lll‘llttEl' also lives beyond
that. It reaches far back to its be—
ginnings. long before the Ancient
Greeks, and draws on its heritage,
so that even its earliest forms are
not lost, never forgotten. Thus, in
t‘SStEIlCC, the theater of today is
the theater oi the Greeks. for its
basis. expression, is the same.

Then too, the theater lives in
many environments and modes;
from ancient lu‘gyptian religious rites
to the popular tlicati-r oi Shakes-
peare; iroin slapstick comedy to
the \t‘iillilli: criticisms of John Os-
borne; and Horn professional Broad-
way, to amateur Poditnk. in be-
tween, tiici‘c lies a world oi theater

Real Athlete
Plays Dangerous Game

By MERT Sl'TlIEerAND

 
 

:_ " . . ' - State‘s hooters lost to Plattsburg
ill-f - , I. ‘  _ ’ ' . 4—1 last Saturday. State also lost
931‘ " ' the services of fullback Dave Frank

  

for the remainder of the season.
Dave. who kicked the first goal of
the game, broke his leg and frac-
tured his wrist on a play in front
of the State goal.

Players Collide

The fullback and two opposing
linemen were coming toward the
State goal. Gary Penficld came out
of the goal to get the ball and the
four collided. the Plattsburgh play—
ctr; filling on top of Frank. Gary
Penfield also left the field with an
injury to his head.

State Ahead

At. the time of the injuries State
was~ ahead 1-0. Carl Gerstenburger
took over in the goal and at half-
time the score was 1-1.

The State tcain (lltl not have the
drive in the second half that it
had in the first hall. The injuries to
the two State players and the loss
of Coach Garcia who went to the
hospital with them left State with-
out any spirit on the sidelines.

Why does an athlete want to participate in a rugged
contact sport? It takes a special type of person to play a
rough and ready sport such as soccer.

Has To Have Desire

The athlete has to have a desire to win. This is the
thing that makes him run a little faster, try a little harder,
and hustle on every play even if he does not stand a chance
of succeeding.

The soccer player has to like the game if he expects to
win. He has to play as hard as he can for eighty minutes.
He has to learn to be ready for the unexpected.

Injuries ’art ()i' The (lame

Injuries are part of the game and the player must
realize this before he starts to play. If he thinks that the
injuries are too much of a risk compared to the fun of play-
ing on a team, then he should quit. Howcvm', sometimes a
player is injured very seriously and people wonder why he
played if he knew that he might be injured for life.
