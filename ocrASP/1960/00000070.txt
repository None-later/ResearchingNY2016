State Entry atUnionAwarded
Debate Council Takes Siena

A two victory win was scored by
State's Debate Council last week.
Tom Henry ’61, secured a position
on the ﬁnal debate team after the
Union College eliminations. Satur-
day, State defeated Siena College
by a 5 to 1 advantaage.

Debaters’ Workshop

As part of the high school work-
shop a demonstration debate was
scheduled between Siena and State.
Debating for us were Diane Israel
'62 and Irene Wister ’63 against
Siena’s Fred Miller and William
O'Rielley, Juniors.

Experts

This round was to give the stu-
dents an insight of intercollegiate
debating. It was followed by a panel
of experts who further discussed
the topic of strengthening the
United Nations.

Dr. George P. Lukas, Political
Science, of St. Rose; Dr. Wallace
W. Taylor, Education, Albany; and
Dr. Matthew Elbow, Political Sci-
ence, of Albany composed the panel.
Three discussion periods climaxed
the day.

Union Competition
A preliminary elimination took

place at Union College Thursday.
This was in preparation for the fol-
lowing evening’s public debate which
concerned the political platforms in
foreign policy.

State's only entry in the inter-
collegiate competition, Tom Henry
'61, was awarded one of the four
positions.

The Council has accepted invita-
tions for November debates from
Toronto University and the Univer-
sity of Vermont.

Chapel Services

Weekly chapel services are being
held at the First Lutheran Church
on Western Avenue, Wednesdays at
8:20-8:40 am.

Sponsored by the Campus Minis-
ter. the Rev. Frank Snow, these
services are designed for State Col-
lege students and faculty members.
Mr. Snow is assisted by an advisory
committee of faculty and students.

Services are conducted by various
ministers from the Albany area.

SMILES to Hold SUB Representative Serves
HalloweenParty Convention as Panel Leader

Monday Night

Smiles will stage its annual Hal-
lowe’en Party for the children at
the Clinton Square Neighborhood
House 7 pm. Monday.

Program

Refreshments and games will be
the main features of the party.
Small prizes will be given for the
games.

A Horror House on the third ﬂoor
of the building is designed for those
students brave enough to wander
through it. Smiles members will
dress up in an attempt to frighten
the children in Hallowe'en fashion.

Smiles members attending the
party may obtain bus tokens from
Betty Klein ’61, Treasurer.

Others in charge of the festivities
include Earl Welker ’61, President;
Pearl Sherman ‘61, Secretary; Joan
Musolino ’61, Vice-president; and
Carol Courselle ’61.

Steve Myslinski ’62, was awarded
a position on the panel at the an-
nual regional convention of the
Association of College Union last
weekend.

Convention

This year the convention con~
vened in Buffalo at the Statler Hil-
ton Hotel. Myslinski served as a
panel member on the discussion
groups and was chairman of one.
State’s three other representatives
secured positions as recorders of
the sessions.

Also in attendance from State
were Cindy Hodge '63, Jack Lindsay
'63, and Sheril McCormack '62. The
convention brought together repre-
sentatives from fifty colleges in the
New York State and Canada region.
The assemblage met to discuss
problems, exchange ideas, and Iain—
iiiarize themselves with the func—
tioning of other unions.

One conclusion reached accord-

ing to Miss McCormack was that
most college unions operate as a
separate entity from all organiza-
tions. Here at State, the Student
Union Board of Governors is under
the jurisdiction of Student Associ-
ation and works with a limited
budget.
