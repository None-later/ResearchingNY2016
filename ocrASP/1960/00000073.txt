State Loses to Bridgeport by 6-0;
Face Montclair Tomorrow in Jersey

Although outplayed most of the first half. the University of Bridgeport defeated the
Pods Saturday at Bridgeport by a score of 6-0. The loss was State's fourth of the season
and leaves them with a 3-4-2 mark.

Last year's runners—up for the NCAA soccer championship and holding a 5—1 record
on the season, Bridgeport was unable to score until the last 15 seconds of the 1mtia1

They did not score again until 45 seconds before the end of the half.
Both goals, however, came on fluke shots. and with a little luck the score may have

been tied 0-0 at the half. . .
The prime reason for the low 2-0 score at half time was the fine defensrve Job turned

in by the team. .
Outstanding were Joe Hickey, who replaced Dave Frank at left back, Ed Bloomfield,

who was shifted to center back and left half Bob Jessup who normally plays msrde left.
Frank Fallace and Carl Gerstenbcrger wcrc shifted to hallbacks to Strengthen the

In the third quarter, Bridgepm‘t got their third goal on a penalty kick.
The i'inal three goals were pumped in during the last period as the Fed defense

began to tire and goalie Dick Mann,
who was playing his ﬁrst game after
only one day of practice, was not
uivcn the protection he needed.

Dick Kranian, the leading scorer
in the New York City arca high
schools. scored «i 01' the Bridgeport
tools. The other 2 were scored by
Majcsko. an All-American. on a
penalty kick and Pyrinski.

Ziicker, another All-American,
was held scoi'cicss. partially because
of lilc i'inc man-to—man dci'cnsivc
playing of (lcrstenbcrger.
