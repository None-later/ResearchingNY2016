(Ed. Note: The following article
originally appeared in the March
15, 1958 issue of the STATE COL-
LEGE NEWS. The article is being
reprinted for the benefit of those
persons who are not aware of the
evolution or operation of our
present-day Student Government.)

An efficient and well organized
student government has always been
a proud tradition at New York
State College for Teachers. Student
government has not only functioned
to coordinate and supervise student
activities; it has served as a train-
ing ground for the development of
competent leaders and the focal
point; of student extra-curricular
interests. Self-governinent in non-
academic matters has remained,
through the years, an integral and
basic part of State College.

The Old

Student government, like all
democratic governments, must be
flexible enough to reflect Chang's
in the society which it serves. For
many years, the town meeting type
government based on weekly all-
collcge assemblies met. the needs of
the school quite well. The Constitu-
tion which prescribed the govern-
mental structure, however, was a
relatively rigid and detailed docu-
ment. When in the early 1950's the
college enrollment more than doub—
led. the student assembly type of
government became painfully in-
.idequute simply because the college
population exceeded the seating
capacity of Page Hull. This in turn
initiated u discouraging and virtu-
ally ununswcrublc chain reaction;
people who could not uttcnd Stu-
dent Association Assemblies were
denied information of the immedi—
ate functioning of government and
lost their right activcly to make

Student Association policy; the loss
of information
disinterest;

became apathy. Apathy is a quiet
cancer of the mind which wages un—
ceasing conflict with the body pol-
itic; it is. moreover, highly in-
fectious. and by 1954 student gov-
ernment at State College was seri-
ously undermined.

The New

Efforts to adapt student govern—
ment to the changing needs and
attiudes of the student body, with-
in the context of the old S.A. Con-
stitution proved to be increasingly
frustrating failures. Midway in the
1956-57 academic year, the malfunc-
tion of student government had be-
come so serious as to necessitate
either a moratorium on government
or a complete revision of principles
and structure. Under the direction
of Student Council. and with the
cooperation of the Administration,
a. student committee was empowered
to write an entirely new Student
Association Constitution.

The Constitution written by this
committee and subsequently ap—
proved by the student body cnvi-
sions a student government which
not only shpci'vises college activities,
but enters actively into the discus-
sion and formulation of policy
which is related to all facets of
college life. Thus the newly formed
SA. Cabinet acts as a channel of
information and ideas between the
college administration, the reconsti-
tuted Student Senate, and the stu-
dents. All legislative and policy—
muking lower is delegated to the
Senate. executive authority dissolves
to the S.A. President and the Cub—
inct, while judicial duties remain
with Myskaniu. All government per-
sonnel are now elcctcd or appointed
on :1 January to Junuury busis.

The new student government is
designed to reach all students: its
purpose is to effect those policies
which are meaningful and import—
ant to the students; it is structured

so as to be flexible and readily
adaptable to unforseen exigencies;
in short it is intended to be a vital
and dynamic force in the total pro-
gram of the College.

First Semester

During its first semester of oper-
ation, the new government organ-
ization has been less than success-
ful. Much time and energy has been
devoted simply to testing the
strength and applicability of the
Constitution, and determining the
proper functions of the branches of
government in actual situations.
Many important precedents have
been set; many problems remain un-
solved. cg. what is to become of
the traditional concept of Mys-
kania?

There is little doubt in our
minds that the new Constitution is
a sound, well-balanced, thoughtful
document. Given competent per—
sonnel who can translate words into
action. reasonable support from the
student body, and the continued co-
operation of our forward-looking
and enlightened administration, the
new Student Association Constitu-
tion will provide the mature and
meaningful type of student govern-
ment which is both necessary for,
and worthy of, State College.

~ New Campus Queen to Reign;

Winning C/ass to Receive Cup

Rivalry officially will come to its close tomorrow night
at 7:30 pm. in Page Hall, with the performance of the
Sophomore and freshmen skits as the annual Campus

Night is presented.

The coronation of the Campus Queen will highlight
the evening as last year‘s queen, Ann Fleming, crowns this
year’s Queen. Preceding the crowning of the Queen, Dick

Robinson will announce the
troduce Myskania. After the

new Senators and then in-
tapping of a Myskania mem-

ber, the usherettes will be announced, their identity tra-
ditionally being withheld until Campus Night.
Frosh Skit
After the crowning of the Queen with a regal tiara and

the pi'occssional of her and

her court around Page Hall,

the Frosh Skit “Heaven Only Knows," will be presented.
The skit, directed by William Schmidt, and assisted by Isa-
dora Barland, is a story based on Greek mythology, the
story of the Pleides. The plot thickens as it deals with find-
ing a new site for our campus. The summation of the story
could be presented in the lines:

“Seven little goddesses all in a fix,

One got married and then there was six.

To find a seventh sister is their aim,

That‘s how Albany came to fame."
