Potter Wins Again

 

By MER’I‘ Sl'THERLAND

Congratulations go to Potter Club for their comeback
wins over Waterbury Hall. The return of triple-threat man
Lu Call from semi-retirement provided the big lift that
Potter needed in the first game.

Lu, former All-Star. had not played this season because
of an injured foot. This makes six league titles in a row for
the men from State Street.

The Team

Herm Altman. Skip Gebhardt, Kim Gifford, Hank
Maus, and Ed Brennan led the Potter line to victory. Bob
Dzikowixz. Danny (Vito) D‘Angclico, Mike Riley. Call, and
Dick Mann were the strong men on offense.

The Veterans

Waterbury Hall ptit tip a tremendous effort. Vic Miko—
vitch, Mike Camiiiarata. Eric Kafka. Bud Baker, and coin—
pany fought right down to the wire before losing.

Basketball

Waterbury Hall took the Basketball title in the first
league last year. A number of teams look strong this year.
Potter. SLS. APA. and KB should be the leaders in the race
this year. I do not think that an independent team will take
the title this year. if you look at the fraternity team ros—

league-leading men of Waterbury Hall came face to face with the ever dangerous foot-
ball powcr of Potter Club. Waterbury entered the game a slight favorite 0n the basis of
an unblemished record of four Wins and no losses. At ten o‘clock the game began.

Potter won the toss and elected to receive. Moving the ball well under the lead-
ership of quarterback Bob Dzikowicz, EEP had moved the ball just across the mid-field
stripe. From here Dzikowicz faded to pass and hit Dick Moore about ten yards over the
line. Moore stood between two defenders, and both teams, believing the play was dead,
started to return to their huddlcs. Suddenly someone shout-
cd to Moore to run, and doing just that. Moore entered the
end zone for the games first score. The point after attempt

Minutes later EEP scored again on a halfback option
