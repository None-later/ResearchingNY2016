Thirty-one upperclassmen receiv-
ed bids this week from the four

keeping sorority girls busy. Plans
for formal rush parties, conflict
parties, and formal dinners, seem
to be the main topic of discussion.

nounces that the formal rush party
will be held tomorrow. The theme
will be “Toyland.”

Psi Gamma

Marge Kropac ’61, President, an-
nounces that there will be an open

Mrs. Bernice Smith.

this. We set Class Spirit, Social
Grace, and Physical Beauty as our
criteria. However, we never set down
these three as the criteria for the
Queen. It was suggested that this
criteria be used as a guide for the
selection of the Queen. but Rivalry
Committee has never taken the po—
sition that they have the right to
tell the student body what their
Campus Queen should be.That is
why you vote for a Campus Queen.

 

 

It is the right of every member of
the student body to decide in his
own mind what a Campus Queen
should be and vote accordingly.

I hope this clarifies any miscon-
ception of what Rivalry Committee
has done.

Sincerely,
Mary Aim Calderonc,
Rivalry Chairman

Faculty Opinion Lays Plans For Conference

By JIM DOUGHERTY

By IRENE WISTER
and LINDA LASSELLE

After the faculty workshop at the
State University Press Association
Conference, the delegates from Al-
bany State asked various faculty ad-
visors from the schools represented
to give statements expressing their
reactions to his speech.

Remarks

In general, the remarks were fav-
orable. Mr. Miller, advisor from
Hudson Valley Tech, commented
that he considered Dr. Collins “the
advisor's idea of an advisor‘s ad~
ministrator.” Mr. Miller agrees that
the role of the advisor should be to
guide and counsel not to direct.

Mr. Paul Gannon, Delhi, believes
that Albany State by its very nature
is exceptional; therefore, the cali-
ber of its students is exceptional.
Thus. it can have publications
without advisors. whereas other
State schools need an advisor.

Mr. Lee Hciiizze of New Paltz asks
questions that if the student pub-
licatloii or another extra curricular
activity is for the purpose of train-
lllL‘, students, where would this train-
ing come from if there is no ad-
visor?

Agi'ecing' with Dr. Collins that an
advisor should advise himself out
of his job was Mr. Howard Miller
of Plattsbui'gli.

Press Mee’r. ..

’(‘iillfflllu‘d from Page 1, Column it!
ulty advisor is not clear. "Is he an
agent for the administration as a

censor or for the students as a
consultant?”
"Our own position is clear-no

faculty advisor for any of our pub-
lications." It is the belief that “the
chief responsibility of the admin-
istration is to encourage the growth
of an independent student body.”

Furthermore, “the publication is
not responsible to the adiiiinistra—
tion but to the student. body. The
student body supports it; the stu-
(li iit body must be represented. This
responsibility begins with the free~
doni to criticize the administration
and faculty."

Subsequently if “the administra—
tion claims no right to censor be-
torc or after publication, then it
does not. have to claim responsibility
for what is written."

llis concluding statement was
that if the administration assumes
responsibility of the student news-
paper, it takes the first. step toward
dictatorship. "It lil'lilltini‘tliH‘S in
that action that the education pro—
ccss is bankrupt."

Officers of l'iiiversity Speak

Dr. Thomas Ii. Hamilton, Presi—
dent, State University of New York,
presented the keynote addrch at
the banquet. He stressed that news-
papci‘s must maintain llll.l‘:l'll)’, i‘c-
sponaibihty and 1'! liaiicc as it is ex-

The seventh weekly meeting of
the Student Senate convened
promptly at 7:30 pm. Wednesday
night in the Brit Dining Room. The
agenda was composed of one finan~
cial bill, commitee reports and an-
nounceinents.

Confused Pedagogue

In a seventeen word bill proposed
by the Finance Committee, the Sen-
ate finally adjusted the $3000 deficit
in the 1959-60 Pedagogue budget.
The actual Ped deficit was only
$221.97, however, an adjustment had
to be made for unpaid bills result-
ing from the publications of three
previous years. A recommendation
vvas also included that the Peda-
gogiie staff request the printer to
render a final bill prior to June 30
of each year in order to facilitate
the closing of the college books on

that date.
The explanation provided by Scri-
ator Caldcroiie. Chairman of the

Committee, and David
thruster of Finance, was
coiil'using one. ththcr
Hl'lldli‘ iwiil': understood the me-
t'llllll.‘,\ of the adjustment is still
llllt‘f‘l'l.'lll I‘lll'llit'i'liltil'f‘, no concrete
proposal was sue cstld to insure
the accurate closing of the books
in the future. It seems that opinions
of per-volts educated in such ac-
counting matters should have been
solicited.

Return of John Yager
Old SA presidents never die, they
just continue to inspire. This refers
to a ten-page paper authored by
John Yager, 1959 SA President. This
paper is an objective summary of
the present form of student govern-
ment as carried out under the pres-
ent four-year-old Constitution. The
paper, which surveys only the first
two years of operation. is to be re-
produced in multiple copies in order
that each Senator and other mem-
bers of the government might have
an opportunity to review it and gain
from the experience of a man who
has proved his talent many times
over.
Leadership Conference
Through the appointment of a
special committee, SA President
Robinson has laid the groundwork
for the second goveriuncut-leader—
sliip conference to be held in the
ast three years. This conference,
to be held several weeks hence, will
consist mainly of an informal dis-
cussion of student government. its
role and objectives. Members of
Senate, Cabinet, Myskania and the.
Administration will take part.
