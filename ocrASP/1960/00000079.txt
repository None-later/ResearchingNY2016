Dear Governor

Two years ago when you were elected, you found it
necessary to raise taxes. To many who pay State Tax, the
increase was understandable in the light of the projects
you planned to undertake. Among these was aid to educa—
tion.

This week, a proposal was made, which if adopted,
would institute a tuition system in State Colleges. Really,
Mr. Governor, we can’t see the need for such action. We
thought that’s what the taxes were for.

Room for Change

With eight sororities on campus, approximately 200
freshman girls have the opportunity to join a sorority each
year. Although such a set-up was satisfactory ten years
ago, the rapid growth of the female population here at
State since then has caused this program to become in-
adequate.

There are two possible solutions to this problem: firstly
at the risk of undermining the basic principles upon which
a sorority is built, ISC could extend the quota of freshmen
allowed to be pledged to each sorority in one year; the sec-
ond answer, the one with which we are concerned, re-
volves around the formation of a new sorority, providing
the administration approves.

A negative reaction to such a proposal in understand-
able; it is difficult, although not impossible, for a group
of girls who have never had previous contact with sorority
mores, finances, and organization to establish a new group
that will become self-sustaining within the first year of
its existence. It is both difficult and time—consuming to
deve10p from scratch the traditions and the prestige that
makes a sorority outstanding .

We have therefore constructed a program which, if
planned carefully, with great detail, would enable a new
sorority to become as financially competent, as active, and
as accepted as the “old’ ones in no time at all. Our plan is
radical; it is not based on new blood, but rather on a
transfusion of “old blood" from the other sister groups on
campus into the new one.

The new sorority would be formed around a nucleus
of some twenty-five girls—Seniors, Juniors, and Sopho-
mores—-who are already members of the established sor-
orities. These girls would be expected to make the sacriﬁce
(and it would have to be a sacrifice, since these girls would
necessarily be quite active members of their organizations)
of leaving the group to which they devoted so much of their
time and effort, to form an entirely new and as yet un—
polished sister-hood. It is important that these “pioneers”
be active members of both their original sorority and of
the school; that they be completely willing to give up all
future affiliation with their old sorority as an institution;
that they all agree to the policies set up by the initial or-
ganizers. It is equally important that the “old” sororities
agree to accept this program without reservation; that
they do not consider it degrading to have these girls leave;
that the girls do not feel that they are forsaking of “letting
down" their former sisters.

The so~called “initial organizers" would be fire four
or five girls, from as many sororities, either Seniors or
Graduate Students, in whose minds this plan first took
root. These girls would set up the fundamental codes, cere-
monies, and purposes around which the organization would
function, and would act as the administrative board un~

Focus
On Faculty

By ED BRENNEN

One of the most popular and best
known members of our faculty is
Dr. Josiah Phinncy. Chairman of
the Social Studies Department. Dr.
Phinncy has been a professor at
SUCEA for the past fourteen years,
twelve of which have been spent
as department head.

Background

The all-around knowledge which
Dr. Phinncy now displays to his
students, as a combination teacher.
adviser, and virtual ‘mother away
from litmc,‘ have deep and varying
roots. He received his undergradu-
ate training at The Boston Latin
School. which, An Introduction to
Education in American Society tells
us, is the oldest existent educational
institution in Ainericia. Majoring in
Economics, Dr. Phinncy received his
Master's Degree from Yale in 1923.

The years between 1923 and 1926
were spent teaching secondary
school in the New York-New Eng-
land area. After two years in the
graduate school at Harvard he re-
ceived his PhD. from that institu—
tion in 1931. and spent the next two
years there as an instructor and tit-
tor while completing his thesis.

The intervenith years have been
put to valuable use teaching: ..t
Williams College in 1928—39 and.
part-time. at Brown University in
1929—30.

With the ("-{t'L‘piltifl of a year and
a half which he spent teaching at
Colgate. Dr. Phinncy was ii full—tune
professor at Lafayette College from
1933 to 1946.

Dr. Phinncy has served continu—
ously on the faculty here since ar-
riving iii the fall of 1946. He was
appointed Chairman of the Social
Studies Department in 1948. a posi—
tion he has held since that date.

Family

With his wife. Esther. Dr. Phinncy
makes his permanent home in Eis-
nicre, New York. He is the father
of two daughters ~Allllt3, who grud-
uiitcd from Oberlin College. in 1959,
.iiid Sarah. who is a Junior iit
Oberlin iit ilrc present time.

The position of Chairman of any
Ut‘liltl'tlllt‘lll. as large. as that of So—
cial Studies requires ii veritable iiiy—
l'l.l(l of talents. Dr. Phiiiney'.» duties
pair a wide field from that oi cur—

The telephone rings. A medium-
sized man with red hair. one shock
of which dribbles down his forehead,
picks the receiver from its cradle.

“Hello. Yes, this is he. Who‘.J
Ike? Ike . . . Ike . . . let's see . . .
OH! That Ike. Yes. yes. thank you.
it feels great. Whattsat? Oh no,

No. let's say . . . bv next week, huh?
Yes. just leave the key under the

He no sooner sets the phone down
than it starts ringing i'lilill. “Hello.

Oh, hello, Nik. Yes I‘ve been ex-

hoarse from all that talking. You

too? Oh, U-L’. You want to buy a

But there's something about the
