When The “

STATE COLLEG E

NEWS" Was 10 Years Old

Ten Year's Old

“Ten years is not a long

time in the life of a man or

of a newspaper. And so in this, its tenth birthday anniver-
sary, the News can claim neither a large amount of aged
tradition nor a great stock of hoary wisdom.

“But a tenth birthday is

nevertheless an occasion for

rejoicing. Mortality rates are lower after it, and so the News
can anticipate a second decade of happy, healthy growth.

The man-child or the fleciging news-
paper has reached a stage where it
is truly an individual recognized as
such by its fellows. The News has
made a place for itself in the Life of
State College, a place which hap-
pily seems to have grown larger as
the years have passed.

No story of the State College
News can be complete which does
not recognize the contributions of
the newspapers founders. The name
of Alfred Dedicke '18 will always
be inseparabiy associated with the
establishment of the News. Dedicke
it was who while still a sophomore
conceived the need and opportunity
for a student paper. It was he who
convinced the student body of that
need. It was he who became its
first editor. And it was he who laid
the policy of the News down on Oc-
tober 14. 1916, in the first editorial.

President Brubacher

If a second name were to be
singled out it would be that of Pre-
sident Brubacher. In the establish—
ment of the college paper as in
the initiation of a surprisingly large
number of other worthwhile move-
ments, the name of the pres-looms
large. As have all other good caus-
es in his twelve years here, the iii-
fant newspaper received his full ap—
proval and support. The News, how-
ever, is a student publication and in
no sense has ever been organ do:
miniated by faculty or other agen-
cies. As the mirror and spokesman
of the undergraduate body it has
and will maintain its obligation to
remain free from control of any
kind, except such as is dictattxi by
decency and good taste.

But under the broad-minded and
fair administration of the College,
no such attempt at dictation has
even been made. Differences of
opinion between the News and the
College officers there have been
and these have been expressed edi-
torially. Such differences will doubt-
lcssiy continue as long as subjects
exist on which student and faculty
points of view may differ.

But the point is, that no such
situation has ever existed as ob
tains in .‘(llllL‘ other colleges where
the pcttincss of administrative poil—
cy has led to a subversion of the
purposes of college journalism. There
has bccn no diggcstlon here of a
prostitution to a situation in which
the dictatorial dominance of faculty
and administration is masked un-
dcr the cloak of honest opinion,

instead Iiicrc has existed a co—
opcration between the News and
College‘s officcrs which has i‘c-uctcd
to the bcnclit of both.

in its nirws policy the paper will
continue to relate College affairs

Name Nearly Lost

The State College News at one
stage in its earliest (lays narrowly
escaped losing its name. Had the
plan of its staff in 1916 been carried
out. today the College might have
not the News, but the State College
Banner, or Times, or any one of a
score of other titles.

“Readers of the News are asked
to help find a name, possibly more
suitable, for the College weekly,"
said an announcement in the first
issue ten years ago today. “The
publishing committee and perhaps
some of the faculty will take final
action October 12. Suggestions are
welcome before that date."

Later in the year, however, the
editor decided that the existing
name was best, and it has become
permanent. The number of news-
papers in the United States with
News as their name, exceeds those
with an other name.

 

Gammunicata'and

 

Editor, the News:

The State College News has been
a force for good in our student life.
Its leadership has been intelligent
and progressive. I congratulate you
and your staff on the achievements
of your first decade and confidently
look forward to yet greater things
from your efforts.

For NEWS Staff

“Fifty-three freshmen and enter-

outs on the News editorial and
business staffs" in 1926.

In 1926 there were also forty-two
regular members of the State (.‘ol-
icgc News staff.

When the News was established in
1916, it had a staff of twelve edi-
torial and business members.

Now in 1960 the staff is made up
of approximately fifteen people.
The staff includes five active fresh-
men.

On Activities Day 1960 over thirty
students slancd up to work on the
State (‘ollege News. Less than
third of these people have entered
the News office.

in 19216 State College was made
up of eleven hundred students. In
1960 it has over twice as many stu-
dents.

SC News Becomes Influence
As Well as Convenience

American journalism, professional
and collegiate, is on the move.

Never before in thc history of
newspaper production have so strik—
intr tendencies toward citinge been
evident. Other periods have seen
more marked lilOVL‘lllt‘lilr. m profes-
sional newspapers, Perhaps there
have been mort- \‘it.al era.» in the,

of economics, the movement toward

NEWS FRIDAY. NOVEMBER 18. 1960

History

of SCN

The committee on publishing a weekly newspaper re-
spectfully submits to you this, the first issue of the State
College News, opening thus, we believe, a new chapter in

the history of State College.

To the many who have been

entirely unaware of the coming of this journal and to
those who do not clearly understand its miss10n we direct

this message.

Class of 1916
Begins NEWS

Vol.1 Oct. 4. 1916 N0. 1

For the benefit of those who are
not frilly familiar with the actual
events so far canprising the history
of the News, we will give a brief
outline of the same.

On Moving-Up Day last spring the
Sophomore class, it being the class
of 1918, presented as its “stunt” an
allegory. the object of which was to
show the advantages of the intro-
duction into college life of a weekly
newspaper. The idea happily con-
curred with a plan President Bru-
bacher had in mind and as a result
the then President of 1918 was call—
ed into Dr. Brubacher’s office and
given authority to publish a college
weekly.

The idea to be carried out was
that 1918 was to provide for a com-
mittee on publishing a college
weekly newspaper; that this com-
mittee was to have charge of the first
issue and of all succeeding issues,
until with due deliberation, it could
.ippoint from the college an efficient
bond of editors, reporters, etc., to
take charge of the publication. In
following these instructions one im—
portant pi ivision was made, that
the board shuiid be so constituted
that beginning the year of 1917 to
19111 the Editor-in-Chief would be
1 Senior and that always, there-
after, only a Senior could hold that
oliice. There are to be no elective
offices, each member of the board
being appointed by the committee,
according to merit only. The merit
system of appointment is to be used
pcriiiancntiy.

To make a. long story short, the
President, of 11118 appointed a com-
illllli‘f.‘ with himself as chairman as
.1 result of their labors the State
(‘oilcge News is here today. The
names of the ilii'llllJCI‘:. of the coin-
nnttcc will be found at the head of
the editorial columns.

that this is a class paper, be '
"clnpllutlt‘lllly emphasized" that this

cil temporarily by a class, but it is

This great United States of' ours
was once a small nation. With a
steadily increasing population the
boundaries of civilization were gra-
dually cxtended, until at last the
Republic reached from ocean to
ocean. Bit the growth of the nation
presented a possible danger, a dan—
ger that was threatening the very
life of the countrye—the danger of
a crumbling nationalism, the dan-
ger of a growing sectionalism, the
danger, therefore, of a country di-
vided, of a nation falling apart.

Then, almost at the crisis, in the
march of progress came influences
that revolutionized the whole polit-
ical and economic status of the
republic. The rails of the railroads
and the wires of the telegraph and
telephone were stretched across the
fields, the hills, and the rivers of
the land, from the East to the West,
form the North to the South. These
bands of inetai bound together the
extremes of the country. one with
the other, making the heterogeneity,
into which the nation had grown, it
solid unit. These modern agencies
of communication brought the hill—
lions of our countiy into direct
touch with one another—made the
whole nation a single political and
industrial fainiiy.

This great State College of ours
was once a small College. With :i
steadily increasing number of stil-
dcnts, courses and activities \vcrc
gradually extended, until today tlic
boundaries of the student—life in
close stretches reaching from the
Literary society, from the library to
Chemistry club to the Promethean
the gymnasium, from the senior
to the freshman and so on, from
one extreme to the other, tout-hint:
upon scores of independent groups,
each with a different interest and
none visibly connected with another.
The close observer must discover
now the presence of that same
threatening dangcr in oiir student.—
life which history shows to have
once existed in the United Stutcs
a decided trcnd toward si-ciionuli.-in
and away from centralization. We
have by no means rcaclicd a crisis,
but there is a great need for some
means by which thcri- can be
brought to bear upon our :tudcnf.

which is being t‘Xf'l‘ll‘tI upon the
nation by the roalrouds, :hc tele—

The State College News is a mass
of mutiiaicd wood pulp found in
bundles on the desk in lower Draper
every Friday morning and in indi—
vidunl sheets on the cafeteria
tables every Friday afternoon; it is
the cause of all the rustlings heard
throughout the boring 5th day af-
icrnoon classes. Perhaps it is all
this. but it is much more besides.

The News is two nights a week
spent pounding a typewriter, at
least five days gathering informa-
iioii, and seven days worrying—
and this is just the beginning. The
inside story of the News doesn't even
begin until Thursday afternoon,
when two or three of the more dedi-
cated journalists journey to Hudson
to spend six full hours serving as
“mid—wives" to the new-born News.

The scene is the Hudson Register—
.s‘tar, Warren Street, Hudson, New
York. The time is 8 am. The print-
crs are sorting out the News copy
which was mailed to them Tuesday
and Wednesday nights from the Al-
bany Post Office. The linotype man
is pounding his tyiwwritcr—like key-
board, which casts out molten lead
sings. the basis for a line of type.
After the type is set, the headlines
are spelled out and cast separately.
Then the pages of type are ready to
be put together according to the
lay—out sheets previously composed
by the News staff and sent down
with the copy two days before,

The entire morning and part of
the afternoon is spent composing
the sheets of type for the six or
eight pages of the News, so that by
4 pin. the first copy of proof is
ready for the first in a series of
proofreading cycles.

The tune is iuiproximutcly 4 p.m.

After each page is double-checked
for cri'ors and corrected, it is handed
back to life linotype man for re-
typing. The corrected lines of type
are then inserted into the compos-
ites and the “second proof" is print-
cd and i'c—chcckcd for errors.
