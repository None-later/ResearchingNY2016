Push-button door handles, inside door locks and a side-view mirror are some of the Corvette cott-
veniences you don’t get on most other sports ‘ars. You also have a wide choice of power teams—ranging
from the standard 230-h0rsepower engine (which cart be matched with Powerglide* to delight the bottle-
vardier) to the swashbuckling Fuel Injection“ V8 with four-speed close-ratio transmission.* Talk it over
with your dealer.Whatever version you decide on, you’re in for the greatest adventure of your driving career!

'Wrestlers Scrimmage OCC

Ranks Still Remain Vacant

Since the wrestling article last week outlined the man-
power shortage on the Frosh and Varsity wrestling teams,
the subject will not be elaborated too much. However,
there are still not enough men on either team to fill out
the rosters. The Freshmen have no men in the 191 and un-
limited classes and the Varsity is missing two men in the
low weight classes because they are doing their practice
teaching—Lou Biolsi and Dave Pause. We would like to see
as many men as possible out for the team.

OCCC Scrimmage Saturday

The State wrestlers start the 1960-1961 season with
a scrimmage with the OCCC wrestling teams. The Frosh
meet OCCC later in the year on December 10 (H) and on
February 25 (A). Last year’s frosh team beat OCCC very
well and Coach Burlingame is looking for a repetition of

last year.

You don’t m a little cap with a belt in the back, or
knowledge of some esoteric automotive jargon to enjoy
a Corvette. All you need is a desire to own a car that is designed for your use personally. This is tto station
wagon, no family sedan, this is ygur car and nobody else’s. It is the ultimate development of a line car that
has known ﬁve years of unparalleled success in the maelstrom of sports car competition, and yet it cart be

As Suds Secs It.

A Question Must
Be Answered

 

 

By MERT Sl't’l‘llERLAND

The fall sessoin is over and the winter program is ready
to begin. As usual, we are not ready to begin with it. We
are not even against it! I guess that would leave us in a
Neutral position, whatever that may be.

Comparativer Speaking

if you went to the IFC smoker you would realize that
comparatively speaking, we are beating our brains out,
(With a Feather) trying to pinpoint our penmanship to—
ward an outward goal that will stimulate the society in
which we live into more active participation in extra-cur-
ricular activities at State. There we go running on again.

Comprehension

If you 'an understand this sentence you will realize
that we are talking about the spiritual aspect of sports on
or around the spectator. No, we are not getting into a
discussion on religion, Not one little old thing has been
said this year about spectator spirit. No, we don't mean
barroom demonstrations on the ability to table—talk.

We are speaking of chccring on the sidelines. The en-
tails thc act of organized yelling. it is really quite colle-
giate. it is not something done just in high-school for the
benefit ot the opposing faction, but which is carried on in
a number of higher institutions of learning.
