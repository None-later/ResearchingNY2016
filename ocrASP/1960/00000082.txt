Summit Conference

Government Groups Review
Problems of School Activity

President Evan It. Collins told
members present at the second
gtwernmcntal Summit Conference
that the administration and stit-
dents should work together to great—
cr limits with the administration
placing no restrictions on govern—
ment if it recognizes other people
in other areas.

Richard Robinson, President of
Student Association. presided at
the meeting of the three organs of
s- t u d e n t. government: Myskania,
Senate. and Cabinet; and members
of the administration: President
Collins, Dr. Ellen Stokes. Dean of
Women. ulid Dr. Clifton (,7. Thorne.
Dean of Men.

History of Meeting

The Summit Conference is a carry
over from the old constitution when
meetings of the gin'erinnental or—
gans were referred to as Leader-
ship Conferences Thc purpose of
the meeting was to discuss how the
three branches of student govern—
ment can and should work together
to provide for a smooth running
“LitiiChiiit‘.”

Questions were discussed relating
to the adequacy of the "machinery"
and the future adequacy of this
type of government in the next
five to ten years when the enroll—
ment, of the college will increase to
4,300 and 7,000.

Election Problem

January to January elections were
discussed with reference to the
problem of Seniors who are active
in Student. Government and must
teach first semester of the Senior
year while still in office. Due to the
many problems involved in sched-
uling and requirements that must
be met, President Collins felt that
it cannot. be guaranteed that Sen-
iors in this position will be able to
(lcler student teaching to second
semester.

The possibility of May to May
e'cctions was suggested. However,
it ‘.\'.t.s pointed out. that the confin-
nitin would he lost over the suin—
liter. and also that the services of
Seniors Would be lost for at least
one quarter during, tleir term of
office.

Purpose of Government

In an attempt to formulate the
purpose of Student (loycrnmcnt the
troop l)l‘.'llll discussion on ways of
l.eepmg student. body interest in

purpose ol Student (lovcrnmenl. is
it. ;',ttlflt' student activities and to
deal with student affairs as well as
to promote mod will and under—
~l.fll(llllL' between the students, inc-
ulfy and administration, the group
felt that one of the main problems
was the lack of effective communi—
e;iliott with the student. body.

This led to Sll.':‘,l'.‘illitll.‘i from the

Heald report has released a

partial summary concerning

the National standing of the College of Education at Al-
bany in comparison with 933 colleges and universities in the
United States. The report was presented to the Council

sented and the relative standing of the college.” He also

mary of information available from a wide variety of sour-
ces. It is admittedly incomplete. We believe, however, it is

consistent tradition of excellence, to support the extension
and expansion of this institution in the greater service of

n

the state.
