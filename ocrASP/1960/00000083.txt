‘lnferior lnstitution'

Fact or ‘FANCY'

In the past several weeks we have seen the Heald re-
port and we are quite displeased With some of the alleged
findings that this committee has published. We are con-
cerned not so much about the entire report as we are about
a certain portion of the report that has labeled the eleven
colleges of education in the State University as “inferior
institutions."

Ever since we have come to this college we have been
told that it is one of the finest teachers colleges in the

country. We have been given smatterings of information -

to prove this theory. Now one of the foremost committees
in the study of higher education in New York State has
labeled our college an “inferior institution.“

In response to the Heald report our college has re-
leased information (incomplete to be sure) showing Albany
to be on an academic level that any graduate can be proud
of. The percentage of Albany‘s graduates going on to doc-

torate degrees is one of the highest in the country. The ,.

percentage of doctoral degrees held by our faculty and the
intelligence of the average student admitted to this college
are both above the national figures.

We feel that an explanation is owed to the student

body and yet, we don‘t know where to turn. It is a sinking :

feeling to hear that, after four years of work, we have been
attending an “inferior institution."

. .\
We would like to know where the Heald Committee re- \

ceived their information. It is a matter of common knowl-
edge that nowhere is there any system for ranking colleges
as superior. good or inferior. This is relative matter and
many things have to be taken into COliSldE‘i‘atlth Vi e. can-
not help but wonder whether or not the commisSion is ex-
pecting the State Universities to turn out atomic SCientists
or qualified secondary and elementary teachers.

Dr. Milton C. Olson. Direstor of
Business Education, is a man who is
outstanding in his understanding
of and interest in students. Perhaps
this interest is best iiliistrated b,\‘
the fact that he leaves his office
door open so that students won‘t
hesitate to visit him.

Education

Dr Olson comes originally from

\finneapolis. .\'Ili‘ill€>lot;l. After coni-
pl: 111-; secondary x’hool there, he

On the other hand we must take into consideration 

the fact that the Heald committee would not issue a state-
ment deliberately designed to undermine the achievements

of our own college, It has been rumored that the commit- ;"
tee's statement was aimed at only two of the eleven teach- .,

ers colleges. The report carried no statements to this effect.
If the rumor is valid then we can do nothing more than

deplore the Heald committee‘s lack of discretion for direct- ’

ing glittering generalizations to specific instances.

The adverse publicity brought on by this committee
can hurt the entire State University in terms of enrollment

and attracting talented students to our college. We feel ‘ ’

that it has reduced the already low morale of the under~
graduates in the State L'niversity.

We are glad to see our ow .
charges with academic fact about Albany State, be hope
that this college will continue to bombard the State Lni-
