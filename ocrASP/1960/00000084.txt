Wrestling, Basketball Begin

 

By MICK 'I‘ Hl'TllERLAND

The first wrestling match of the season will be held
tomorrow afttrnoon in Page Hall. Cortland State Teachers
College will bring a squad of fine wrestlers into the city.

Larger (‘rowds Expected

We hope to see a larger number of spectators iii Page this
year. Many people believe that wrestling as a spectator
sport in this part of the country is just catching on Larger
crowds every year at State‘s matches seem to agree with
this theory. '

There arc thrcc holdovcrs from last year's team. C0-
