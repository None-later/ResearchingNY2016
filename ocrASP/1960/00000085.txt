ALBANY. NEW

Money Requests & Elections
Dominate Senate Meeting

’IRventy-four senators were pres-
ent at the Wednesday night meeting
as three bills went into committee.
The bills read included the “General
Election Bill,” a surplus request
from Student Union Board. and
line transfers for WAA.

Student Union Board

Steve Myslinski, treasurer of Stu»
dent Union Board. made a request
for $60 to be taken from Surplus to
provide transportation lbusest for
the Childrens‘ Christmas Party. The
bill was placed into committee and
will be considered at the next week
meeting.

WAA Request

The Finance Committee gave a
second reading of a WAA request
for line transfers to provide a line
for two trips, referees for basket-
ball gamcs, and additional awards.
WAA has run into other line diffi-
culties due to lack of general knowl-
edge in budget preparation. Sen»
ate has often been critized for its
lack of experience and know—how:
perhaps other organization oil'ieers
should be "called down" for their
laxity lll handling budgets,

General Election Bill
The Election Committee cliniriiian.
Anne Siiiilli. read a bill prepared to
include all Student Elections. The
bill, if passed, will take care of five
clections- general Student Associa-
tion and Class elections, replace-
ment elections, Who's Who election,
Campus Queen election, and the

Junior Prom Queen election.
it was pointed out, however, that
since the bill provides for the. gen-
eral election to take place in Deeem~
her, it. was unconstitutional. The
constitution provides for a second—

ion of the Senate and parliamentar-
iz-li, seemed to indicate that the
voting should continue to be held
second semester.

The committee will reconsider the
bill and take care of this as well as
other discrepancies uncovered at the
meeting.

Purpose of Bill

The purpose of this bill. in is—
scnce, is to save time. The l‘t‘ilillll‘
of the bill bi‘oiieht out many olher
questions that are \\‘(li'lll Senate
consideration. One of the questions
concerned the much - talked - a'ioiil
May to May election. If Senate dc-
cides on this revised election pro—
ccdui‘e. the “General Election Bill"
would have to be revised As one
of the more loquaclous senators re-
lllill‘llt‘fl, however. "Let’s build the
house and then worry about decor—
ating the walls."

How About Grads

Another question uncovered was
that of how graduate students >liill<l
\‘.llll respect to SA membership
l'hey only pay partial Student 'i‘ux,
bill as the tax card reads now, are
iiililled to full benefits of a regu-
larly enrolled student. The solution
suggested was to change the written
iiiaicrial on the back and perhaps
change the color to make the dis-
tiiiction.
