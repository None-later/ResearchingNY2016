Wrong Interpretation

In reference to the editorial of last week concerning
the Heald Commission report, it was stated that according
to this report, the eleven Colleges of Education in the State
University were labeled by the committee as “inferior in-
stitutions.”

We have, however, since last week, secured a copy of
the report and feel that it was misinterpreted by a number
of local and state newspapers from which we obtained our
information.

It is important that we quote the section of the report
related to the Colleges of Education.

“Among the aspects of education that we can do some-
thing about, teaching is central. The preparation of teach—
ers for our schools is one of the critical areas for improve-
ment and experimentation. Some fundamental and far-
reaching reforms are in order. for the goals and interests
that have characterized American public education up to
now are not sufficient in this swiftly moving age.

“We propose, therefore, that the state Colleges of Ed-
ucation be converted into liberal arts colleges, starting im-
mediately. In those two or three instances where it may
not be possible to convert a College of Education into a
good liberal arts college, the institution should become a
community college. The State should not create inferior
liberal arts colleges in place of inferior teachers colleges."

There is no statement in the above quote or any part
of the Heald report which labels our college as an “inferior
institution."

Why then have so many newspapers that we have read
taken only parts of the above quote and, consequently, dis-
torted the facts? Unfortunately we can not answer this.

We have, however, presented proof that the Heald re
port has not made any attempt to “undermine our uchicvc—
ments.“

Christmas Commercialism

It is a fine and wonderful thing to be able to enjoy
Christmas spirit and the resulting time of good feeling.
We feel, however, that our nation is starting to go over-
board in relation to the uses of the Christmas spirit.

We feel that Christmas decorations in November, San—
ta Claus arriving December 1st. and constant reminders
of the number of shopping days left to “X-mas" are , at the
minimum, very repulsive ideas. Christmas is no longer a
one day affair, it is now a month and a half drive by mer-
chants to unload merchandise they can‘t sell during the
rest of the year. Little did the Three Kings know that they
were starting a precendent that. today puts families in debt
for three or four months.

Pity the poor, tradition loving, family man who speaks
out in favor of no presents, no feasts and no drinks, but
rather for a day spent reflecting the meaning of‘Christmas.
He would probably be 'allch Un-Ameriéan, tie. against
capitalism) and a subversive trying to tear down every—
thing we stand I'oi' tie. money and what it can buy'). His
kids would hate him and he might even be investigated
by the American Legion and DAR. ’ I

Developing this presently accepted theory that “it is
the gift, not the thought that counts.“ we ought to change
the title of "Christmas Spirit" to “Bolster the Nation’s
Economy Month." The only reprocussion that might ensue
is that David Seville and his Chipmunks might go bank-
rupt.

and objective one. Another poll
taken showed the overwhelming ma-
jority of students and supervisors
to be in favor of such a system.
Off-Campus Most Favorable

The students teaching off-campus
were particularly in favor, as were
their supervisors. A primary reason
for this is the fact that geographic
inconvenience in communication be-
tween the teachers and supervisors
may cause much poorer relations
than those in Milne where control
and supervision is direct. Most stu-
dents i'clt that the criteria of judg-
ment was too subjective in view of
the varying situations of class eon-
difioiis. co-operafing teachers and
the grade and ability of the classes

“Pink Sheet"

ion of the committee reflected a sat-
isf'acfory performance by the stu-
dent. teacher rather than a grade of
A. B. C. or I), This "pink sheet"

in recommendiiur and hiring teach-
ers is the real evaluating insiriuiieiif
because the actual LlI'flIlI' is rai'clv
