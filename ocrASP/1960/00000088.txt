Bill King

Unaccustomed as I am to Writing . . especially a
sports column, I will now begin “King’s Kwotes.” This is
the third mass of neurotica that has graced these pages
in as many months. We only hope that we will do as well
as our predecessors.

Waterloo

On December 6, nineteen-hundred-and-fifty-six, our
vaunted basketball team met their Duke of Wellington in
the person of the Oneonta State ball team.

Those of us around here who cared, wanted the Feds
to go undefeated, at least among our sister State schools.
This now~impossible accomplishment would in part make
up for our loss of face in the medieval playing facilities of
Page Gym.

While we're on this subject, the facilities for soccer
should also be mentioned. Never have we heard of the play-
ing field for a college soccer team being a barren field used
on week—days for gym and intra-mural football games.

Enough knocking, now for some back—slapping. Con-
gratulations to Don Cohen and Jim Oppedisano on their
fine play in both games. Also to the rest of Sauer’s Super-
men who perhaps do not make their real value felt in the
scoring column. We finally spelled Mr. Sauer‘s name cor-
rectly.

Cortland Swamps State's Matmen, 42-0;
Crow Looks Good in Exhibition Match

By BOB DAVIES

Last Saturday, it happened! We couldn’t see or hear it coming, but it still came.
The Cortland State wrestling team had slapped us with 41-0 and 42—0 defeats. While we
were picking up the pieces from our defeat We couldn’t help but think about the reasons
for our defeat. After due consideration, we decided that there were several shining lights
among the nightmare of black.

State College greatly misses not being able to have Clem Crow on the Varsity list
until February. Clem is a transfer student ffrom Union College and is consequently in-
eligible for one-half year after transfer.

However, Clem was able to put on a brilliant display of wrestling talent and skill
when he wrestled Cortland‘s Mark Cranfield in an exhibition match. Clem pinned Crane
field in eight minutes, thirty-five seconds with a stack and double arm bar.

Clem, voted Most Outstanding Wrestler at the AAU Tourney held in Albany last
year, has a very deceiving style. At first glance, it seems as though Clem is riding so
loose, that this opponent would have no trouble getting away. At other times it seems

as though Clem is too far off
that at times like this Clem is in complete control of his man.

balance to control his man properly. However, it so happens
With complete con-

trol, Clem utilizes balance, timing, skill, a‘ld patience to win his match. It has been
commented that even while Clem is on the bottom, he works in such a way that his op—
ponent doesn‘t really seem in control at all, just marking time until Clem sets him

up for a reversal and a pin.

APA Trounces Sayles;
KB Defeats Men's, 51-49

Tuesday, a small KB five squeaked by counselor-loaded
Waterbury Hall 51—49. In the first half, Waterbury domin—
ated play being led by Baker, Kafka, Wolner, and Rath.
Rath sparked the team with his long one handers as Wa-
terbury rolled to an eleven point lead at half time.

The second half was a complete change as the slow
to start KB team caught fire. Led by the veterans Bob
Sands and Bill Kohn. KB turned the deficit into a seven
point lead, with some key buckets by Hohn and Sands.
However. Waterbury fought back in the waning moments
and cut the lead to one point. Waterbury was unable to
score again and the game ended with Hohn adding a free
throw for KB. All in all. the game was a thriller but both
teams displayed a weak defense and inconsistent offense.

Al’A-Sayles

APA opened its season Monday night with a not too
impressive win over Sayles Hall, 53-31. Led by Dave Jan—
ick's scoring and the rebounding of Jerry Blair and Irv
Hunter, APA opened up a 32—151 hall-time lead. However,
in the second half. it was a different story. A sci'uppy—out—
manned team put the pressure on and pushed APA from
running away with the score.

Dave Janick and Chuck Hunter led the APA scoring
with 18 and 11; points respectively, while the Sayles scoring
was evenly distributed.

State, who succumbed 89-64 in last season‘s visit to Albany, boasts a 2—0 record this
year with losses handed to Cortland and Oswego. Dave Lewis led the Orangemen in their

WRAPPING I'AI’EII

“.5 s 'l‘AI’E

 

Teachers College. The Knights are expected to be weak and
little opposition for the visitors from Albany. On Tuesday
the home team will take its last bus trip of the year in an
at tempt to hand Utica a well deserved defeat.

Welcome Ilome

Thursday, December 15th, the Sauersmen will return
home for a contest with Potsdam State Teachers. The
Racquetecrs who suffered a 74—73 defeat in their last meet—
ing with the Feds, do not boast any crucial changes in this
year‘s roster.

Oneonta, ()ooops!

Well it had to happen, but we didn't expect it so soon.
After hearing so many optimistic rumors about our team
lhls year. We were greatly disappointed in the poor showing
Albany put on at the Oneonta Armory this past Tuesday.
It is a sorry thing, to see four men watch the fifth struggle
for rebounds. Talking to Coach Sauers, the Fed mentor
credited the loss to "the inability of the backcourt men to
handle the ball. This is the best inspired team I’ve seen
Cliasc come up with in my six seasons at State. They want-
ed to win a lot more than we did and they did.“ As t0
the slight partiality of the referees Sauers stated that
“they let the game get a little out of hand.“

The majority (21 for 251) of the Dragon field goals were
layups. High score for the Red and White was Battaglini
who talalcd 22. Cohen led the Feds with 10 field goals sec—
onded by ()ppcdisano who shot 8 for 20 from the field. Total
percentage for the Albanians was 28 for 82. and 14 earned
points from the foul line.

Last S:.ttii‘(liiy the l’cds handed Maritime their first
loss of the season 511-511. High scorers were Casey and Cohen
totaling lSl points each.

In closing we would like to mention the accomplish-
incnts of Ray Weeks who scored 36 points for the freshmen
against ()nconla. Hay hails from l’aichague L.I. and towers
at six feet lour inches. Coach Saucrs stated after watching
the ace shooter in action last Tuesday “he‘s an excellent
shooter he has a lot to learn about defense and ball-handl-
ing but he‘s defii'iitely the leading candidate for next year's
Varsity Squad."

Erosh Basketball
According to Coach Al Rabinowitz this year's frosh
team. while it is taller than last year's quintet which gar-
nered a 15-10 record, is both slower
and less accurate than the 19:39-60
