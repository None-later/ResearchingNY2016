Students Want
S-U System

By LEE UPCRAF’I‘

Much collfusioll has arisen recent-
ly among the student body concern—
ing the faculty recommendation
that tile student teaching evaluation
be converted from an ABCDE sys-
tem to a 511LlSlilCLOI'y—llllstlLlSlilCLOI’y
ruling. This confusion has resulted
lll ll mlsllndcrstallding of the com-
mlllcc‘s riconlmcndiitions. Several
points should be made clear.

Recommended Change

The original impetus for the rec-
lrllll lldcd (‘Ililllglf CillllL‘ from lllc stil—
licnis. An open lllcctiilg was held
..lsl spring: for a discussion of the
pruning system. at which time it
was cvldcnl. lll. lcnst among those
present, that the existing grading
system was inadequate ill many rc-
.\lll'l'Li.

Shortly thereafter. a faculty colli-
mlilcc. consisting oi student tcuch-
mg supervisors, was appointed to
luliller investigate this matter. A
poll llmong twenty—nine supervisors
lnlllclllcd that 64'; of tllclll favored
lllc S-U sj,'sl.clll. The committee dc-
lll)l'l‘ill(‘(l for nearly lour months,
and concluded that an S—U system
would better suit the llccds oi bolll
lllc :ludcnts and lllc supervisors.

Student Questiolulalrc

was ii lpll'htliillllltli‘c, llllSWl‘I‘L‘d by

New Building to Include
Gym and Student Union

The State University College of Education at Albany
campus definitely will be relocated on approximately 220
acres of the Albany Country Club property about two and
one half miles from the present site Oil Western Avenue it
was learned yesterday. It is expected the main entrance of
the College will be on Western Avenue with other entrances
to the campus from Fuller Road and Washington Avenue.
Additional Country Club property fronting on Washington
Avenue probably will be acquired by the State for use in its
office building program

If architectural plans can be progressed rapidly, it is
hoped that ground can be broken in the spring of 1962.
First occupancy at the new campus is expected in the fall

of 1963 or shortly after,

Senate

SA President
WritesSenate

To The Absent Eleven:

If there had been minutes of
Sellate for Wednesday, December
14, 1960 they woull have read. “The
President didn't call the meeting
to order at 7 pm, there were no
minutes approved, aild nothing was
accomplished. The reason for this
was that there were too many sell-
:ltors absent to constitute a quor—
um."

Each morning the President of
Student Association gets up at 5:45
am. to prepare for ills presence ill
Schenectady at 8 am. School is out
at 3 pm. and remedial class follows.
When this is through he drives back
to Albany, not to his apartment,
Lot to school where he checks the
Student Personnel Office and any
other lleCCSsitics which may arise.
Of course, there are teaching sem-
inars. supposed meetings of Senate,
Staacsnlcn, and other such Obligil‘
tions.

I do not mean to complain. I lic-
cepled this job and look iill oath
of office which meant something- to
