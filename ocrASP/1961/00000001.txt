French Group
Begins Club

"Les Innavateurs” or the members
of the recently organized French
Club, had their initial meeting last
week. About thirty members were
pct-sent to decide on policy concern-
in; meetings, dues and language.
Mary Ellen DiDonna, Judy Mahr
and Victor Faubert presided over
the meeting.

The group will meet every other
Wednesday night; dues will be $1.50
a semester; and, if possible, only
French will be spoken. This is in
line with the main aim of the Club
to improve its members‘ fluency in
French.

However, membership is not re-
'l'itflctl to students taking French
courses. Anyone interested in gain-
ing practice in conversational
l"l't'llt‘ll is invited, regardless of pro—
i'icicncy.

A Christmas meeting will be held
in Brubachcr at 7:30 pm. Monday.
The pi'o'n'ani includes three French
spcalzing guests who will discuss
l-rcnch Christmas customs and lead
ihc groip in singing Christmas
Carols.

Swinging ganla
ﬂannel Rubric/24

'Twas the night ere vacation,
And all about State.

Not a mind was in function.
Not even in hate.

The. Freshmen were hung.
By the roadside with care,
In hopes that a gendarme
Would lead them to lair.
My chick in her leotards
And I in my drums,

Had just settled down

For some Hedricks and Tums;
When out on the lawn
There arose such a wail,
Some cat with his bonuos
Was hcaded for jail.

l focuscd my glims,

And what did I see,

But the wildest out

With :1 snow-white goatce
He revved up his Jaguar
And peclcd round the block.
Then tnadc for my rooftop
To makc ihc place rock.
Hc slid down the chimney,
His bonito- in hand,

All bundlcil in SWP‘lISliII'I.
Miann~|y tanned.

He made without words,
Direct for the bar,

Had two healthy belts,
Thcn ul‘ubill'tl my guitar.
He. started lil wailin',

flow that man could go,
"l.ikc, kiddies," he said,
'(Jomcs Christmas, you know,
I malzc it around,

To the swingin'cst tots,
And always avoid

’llic nit-of—it spots.

So l:ccp yourselves liinbcr,
The whole year aroun',
And yizz‘ll be hottest
When Santa‘s in town."

He coolcd oil the guitar,
Atid gunled a third,

’l‘hen made for the window
And all that we heard,
Was the roar of his Jag,
And a beat New Year twist,
And. "A cool Yule to all,
From the State Solecist!"

 

Grading . . .

(Continued from Page 1, Column 3}
Factors Considered

With this background in mind,
several other factors should be con-
sidercd.

1. According to our catalogue, a
 represents average work in a
course; yet, 91".? of all student
teachers receive either an "A" or
 Thus in this course, “C” is a
below average grade, so in effect
we already have a two grade sys-
tom.

2. The evaluation sheet which is
placed in the placement folder at
the completion of student teaching
does NOT include the mark receiv-
cd in student teaching. The pros-
pcctivc employer sees only the rec-
ommendation written by the super—
\‘lMll'. Thus, an outstanding teacher

recognized where it counts the
most: in the folder given to high
school principals.

‘5. There is no agreement among
.x‘lllL‘lllSlll'n or students as to what
-ru«ri.i illSIlll‘LlllFlllOS an A. B, C, D.
or it li-:ii'lit'i'. What one :-:upervisor

Music Council to Host
Belafonte Folk Singers

The Belafonte Folk Singers, directed by Robert De
Cormier, will perform Tuesday night in Page Hall, as the
second Music Council guest performance of the season.

The Folk Singers, comprised

of twelve male vocalists and

three instrumentalists, have provided the background
music for the recordings of popular singer Harry Belafonte
since 1957. Their effectiveness merited a solo debut in
New York last year, eliciting raves from critics. The con-
cert at Albany State is part of a seasonal tour covering
sixty-five cities in the United States and Canada.

The group‘s repertoire,

a varied one of folk music

from around the world, includes selections ranging from
