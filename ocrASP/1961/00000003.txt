Wrestlers 0" Wilkes Last Wee/<2 Peds Place Third in NAIA Tourney;

Meet C. W. Post on Saturday

By BOB

During the Christmas vacation
while everyone was home enjoying
the holiday and all that goes with
it, six statesmen were working hard,
trying to win a wrestling match.
These six grapplors, Clem Crow.
Jay Katzel. Van Brower, Dick
O'Connor, John Woytowich, and
Ted Dusanenko, were entered in the
1960 Wilkes Tournament at Wilkes
Barre, Penna.

The Wilkes Tournament is an an-
mtal affair held each year at Wilkes
College. To the tournament come
wrestlers frotn the North. South.
and Mid-West United States and
from approximately thirty colleges
and universities. United States
Olympic champs, NCAA champs.
and precious Wildes Champs are
among the royalty of wrestling
present.

This year, about three hundred
and ﬁfty wrestlers from such col—
leges as: Pitt, University of Michi-
gan, Army, Navy, Yale. Harvard.
Ohio, Lockhaven, and many others
were present. Pitt won the team
award with University of Michigan
coming in second. Carmen Mclino
of NYAC won the award for the
Most Outstanding; Wrestler. Carmen
was originally frotn Cornell.

Clem Crow of Albany was unfor-
tunate to draw Gary Simmons who
was the US. Olymbpic wrestler in
the 115 pound division at Rome.
Italy last year. Simmons has also
won a previous Wilkes champion-
ship and the NCAA championship.
Clem wrestled a very good match
against his fine competitor, losing

DAVIE S

by only two points, 6-4.

The other five Albany men also
wrestled ﬁne matches but also lost
by decisions. Their opponents were
all topnotch wrestlers and much
was gained by all concerned. The
Albany Varsity wrestling team has
benefitted highly from the exper-
ience gained through this tourna-
ment and the results should soon
show up in the performance of the
team.

CW Post Has Fine Show At Wilkes

The CW Post wrestling team also
attended the Wilkes Tournament
and wound up in a good position.
Several wrestlers from CW Post
finished among the top four.

The Albany grapplch take on CW
Post this Saturday in Page starting
at 2 pm. This should prove to be
a tough but highly exciting match
and all are lll“',8(i to attend,

The Varsity takes on the Oneonta
wrestling team for the first time
January 11. This match should shed
a little light on what the team can
expect in the Quadrangle meet
February 25, when the four teach—
crs' colleges in the wrestling circuit
meet.

The varsity roster has been bOUSi-
ed to 10 this week, the highest it.
has been in some time. The Varsity
gained a man to fill the previously-
\':icant 177 pound slot. Dave Jarvis
is this man and shows promise of
bring an important addition to the
lineup. The fl‘oldl lineup has been
shifted a little. This week Ron
Schultz. will wrestle 130, and Tom
Mcssina will wrestle 137.

tion contest held Tuesday afternoon. The Sauersmen
e sparked by Roger Casey who came off the bench to
ing three quick hoops that gave the team a lead

In the second half of the opening contest, the Peds
hung in the lead on key beeps by Sherwin Bowen after Don
Cohen had fouled out on three needless fouls with fifteen

minutes remaining.

Against Maryland State, a mitch taller team than the
Pcds, the sauei'smen chose to play an extremely deliberate
game by holding the ball and waiting for the breaks. This
method proved quite successful against the rangy Mary-
land qulnt as the Peds held them in check until midway
in the third quarter when the Hawks scored eight straight
points to break a 20-20 deadlock.
