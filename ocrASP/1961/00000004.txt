Adieu

The time has come old Newsboard said for me to bid adieu
To take exams and students teach, and relax a little too.

Perhaps some think I’m more than pleased, to leave this
job behind

To gain relief and time to breath along with peace of mind.
But I will miss without a doubt. the pleasant atmosphere
0f working late in Brubacher 8 to beat the deadline fear.

Of printer‘s ink and Thursday's rides on that wheezing
puffing train

For me they’re. past. to Bill they go with luck throughout
his reign.

 

W“A AA“‘A“‘AA‘.‘AM“AA‘AA‘AAAAAA

To Bill . ..

Congratulations Bill, you have been elected to the
“most important position in the school." Don't let the
students down—they deserve the best and you‘re the one
to produce it.

I hope that this year will be as worthwhile and re-
warding for you as the past one has been for me. You have
an expert staff and cooperation from all. Best of luck Bill
for a successful and prosperous year.

When things get rough and you feel like throwing
your hands up and walking out, remember Bill “you have
45 past editors watching over you," and “the News always
comes out on Friday."

Help! Move Books

An all college project will be underway soon in the
form of a “Move Books in Library“ day (See story page 3).

Sounds to us like a good ideaha way to show some
spirit as a college. It also provides an excellent opportuni—
ty to increase student-faculty relations. Here's a chance to
work hand in hand with members of the faculty and ad-
ministration whom you may know only on a formal basis
either through a class or merely by sight.

You don‘t need to be a muscle man to participate
anyone can carry four or five books across a street.

Further details of the move will be announced soon.
In the meantime. don't forget about it. Let's see everyone
participate!

To the Editor:

During the past semester frequent
criticism has been directed toward
the Student. Union and. more un-
fairly. to its employees. Although
some of this criticism has been jus-
tif'iable. a great deal of it has been
slanderous and childish. It is about
time that our college friends AND
the News Board begin to realize
that the “atrocious situation" might
be alleviated with the cooperation
of both the employees and the cus—
tomers. It is completely ridiculous
to place the. full burden of com—
plaints on the employees

It is certainly irritating for us to
be constantly subiected to the rude
practices of many customers Typi—
cal orders we recently received
were:

"Gimme five BL’F’s. one with tons
of iiiiiyoiinaise, one without. lettuce.
two on rye. three on white with two
toasted." and "I wanna double
cherry coke with a shot of vanilla."

We are iioi. disputing that thesi-
orders are perfectly legitimate. but
on Saturda' at noon. with 50 other
people screaming for lunch, ii is
difficult. and nei've—wiuickiiig to fill
this type of order. To top this off.
some choice customers have ex-
treme diﬁ'iculty linding' their money
even iliough they claim to have
waited half an hour. This is irritat-
lit: to say the least.

It has been a SUB rule for some
iime that. students (‘ll'iil‘ off their
lal)lc.~ after use. The number who
do this can be counted on one hand
How large do signs have to be lit--
i'orc college students see llll“li .iiid
follow them?

The Student Union was built to
accommodate about 3:30 students. We
are now serving well over liltiti
Need we say Inorc‘.’

As you can sci‘. the i'llSloiiici'». can
do a great deal in our drive lor .i
better functioning Student Union

viie Mr. Common—statcr to join our
staff (llll’lIiL'. these difficult days. Be—
cause he has done so much research
on thc problem we are sure that
under his expert guidance startling
changes will occur. Also. it would be
a golden --pportuiiity for him to
