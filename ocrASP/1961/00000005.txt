By midnight tomorow we will know whether State‘s
powerful offense triumphed over Siena‘s sticky defense.

The Sauersmcn will be matching a better

shooting

ability, stronger rebounding potential. and a deeper bench,

against Siena’s poise. aggressiveness. teamwork.

this year than they have ever been.
The Best Offense Is

The Indians coach, Dan Cunha. has person
ed the Feds three times this year.

and rough
with the Armory

ally scout—
In all three games, the

aggressive defense used by the opposition succeeded in
slowmg the Sauersmcn and gave them quite a bit of

trouble. For this reason Pcd mentor Dick Sauers e

xpccts

the Indians to rely heavily on their vaunlcd defense. As
a counter the Statcsmen will most likely play a deliber—

ate offensive game. taking only the

best shots and hoping

their scoring average will bc better than it was last year.
Similar To Maryland State (lame

The Feds will be playing a style of game similar, but
less extreme. to the one they used against Maryland State
in the Christmas Tourney. Gone from this game will be
the great height advantage enjoyed by the opposition.
Sauers expects thc team that scores sixty points to

take tomorrow night‘s game.

Brooklyn. Last night the Indians playcd Utica. a lcum thc
Pods met and dcicalcd curlicr this scason, 76—50.

The (‘hessmen

Just as in a gamc of chcss lhc opposiing coaches have
planned their strategy. the rest is up to the players.

Siena is led by senior guard Jim Woodward. who is
averaging 14.8 points per gamc and was an honorable
mention in the weekly ECAC major college all—star team.

Others starting for thc Indians will he Huntingdon,
Healy, Ahcarn. and Gary Smith.

John Wallace and Jim Oppedisano will start for State
at forwards. They will l)c joined by Sherwin Bowen and
Roger Casey. who is ailing, at guard. Don Cohen averag-
ing 18 points per gamc and who is recovering from a touch
of the flu. will start at center.

Freshmen Game

The frosh teams of both schools will inccl in the pre-

liminary at 6:30.

Siena. according to all reports, has a grccn team. al—
though they sport scvcral good playcl‘s.
