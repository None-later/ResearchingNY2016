Unopposed;

Outlines SA Platform

My platform for SA. President
includes these major areas: trans—
portation, student-faculty relations,
and communiciiiions.

i wish lo continue working for
the purchase of a bus which would
eliniinaic rental cost, increase ed-
ucational trips and trips for cam-
pus organizations and also pro-
vidc economical access to the col-
lege campus.

As an integral part of college life,
studcnt~facully relations is a major
area of my platform. I would con-
lmuc lhc Stiidciu l’zicully Commis»
sion and cncouriigc their work. As
another part of this relationship,
I would continue the leadership or
Summit Conference involving all
major areas of Student government
and the adminisiraiion.

t‘omiminicalions is a most im-
portant far-cl of an efficient gov»
crnnicni and school. I would en-
courage the radio station pro-
gram. Another way of improving
communicalions. 1 ice] is to have
a greater representation and use
of people intereslcd in student
government. in this way i foresee
an increase in government pres-
tige and increasing chances for
inorc communication bctwccn the
siudcni body and student govern-
ment. Last, but not least, I would
like to create a general govcrn<
mcnl office.

General Aims

'l‘hc prcccdlng have been my spe-
cific aims but more gcncrally, I
would like to see improvement in
the following areas. rccrcaic cal)-
inci power of advisoi‘ship to the
prcsidciit and Scnaic. betterment of
coiiimunicalions betwecn Myskania
and the student body, bring the
\'icc-pi'csi(lciit of S./\. to a more
activc position as a coordinator of
noirstandiiig Sciiiilc committees,
and bring about an curly consider-
ation of budget.

As you haic l'L'fltl my platform,
you have sccii the areas in which
i fch student govci'iiiiicnt could
llt' bcttcr. Aflcr a coiisidcraiioii of
these issucs which l hopc will benc-
fil all of us hcrc iil Slate. I ask for
your volc.
