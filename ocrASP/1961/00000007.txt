Our Policy

In nearly every change of an administration, it is custom-
ary to either restate the old policy, or to state the new policy,
and the latter is our intention here. We feel there is a defin-
ite change in policy due on the News. What we propose in
the way of a new policy is designed to make the paper not
only more interesting, but to make it what it was originally
intended to be—a paper of the student body at State.

In the past some people have deigned themselves judges
and critics of the News, and some of their criticism has been
valid, fair and helpful—but by the same token, much of it
has been unfair. We are not adverse to criticism; we will
welcome any suggestions that may serve to make this a bet—
ter paper. However, we also serve notice that whatever we
consider to be unfair, invalid criticism shall be duly recog-
nized and renounced as such. And any criticism that is not
made directly to the Editor (who, al’te' all, is responsible)
shall, and must, be considered as unfair and invalid. (Though
we must admit that the weekly cafeteria sniping is tradi—
tional, and we seldom take it to heart.)

The job of any newspaper is to report the news. Too
often in the past, the type of news that makes any college
campus a college campus has been suppressed. However, we
consider ourselves a newspaper, and what is news, no matter
how controversial, must be printed. In this respect, there—
fore, we pledge ourselves to an honest and sincere effort to
print all the news, whenever the facts are available.

Along this line, the question of editorials must be con-
sidered, and we have but two things to say here. First: An
editorial in an article in a neWspaper explicitly stating the
opinions of the Editor, or Editors. And secondly: We intend
to state our opinions.

As regards the. submitting of material to the News, we
have organized our staff in such a way that department
heads and the administration shall be contacted weekly.

Finally, we should like to remind you that this is a stu-
dent newspaper, it is operated primarily through student
funds. We want to make this neWspaper both interesting
and vital to the student body: our efforts are pointed towards
this goal. We want, and welcome, your suggestions. We, in
return, offer our time and effort for what we consider to be
a worthwhile endeavor.

Scientific Method

Problem: How to l‘lt't’cctiyely Miss a Final?

Materials: 1 Teacher, 1 Boss, Tired ill-prepared student.
and ONE 9 .-\..\l. SCHEDULED FINAL EXAM.

Method: Make tip your mind that you Would rather sleep
than take a final and do just that. Of course,
you assume nebishly that you will receive an
E for the course.

Obser 'ation: l-lefore long, you will be awakened by a frantic

'all from your teacher, aiiil “Why aren't you at
the exam?” Knowing that honesty is the best
policy, reply humbly — ‘l was not prepared for
the exam and thus decided not. to take it'.
“(let the boss's approval and I‘ll give you a re-
cxam." I’olitely say thank you and graciously
say good—by.

Forty-eight hours later with the boss’s lenient
approval, you have taken the rc-exam and passed
the course to your convenience.

Practical Application: We salute the dedicated teacher, our
lenient boss, and the student who knows how to
have his cake and eat it, too!

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FEBRUARY

 

eomm'cda'awl

Dear Students:

During my semester here at
State, I discovered several similar-
ities and differences between col-
legc life in the states and in Colom-
bia.

In Colombia I attended a state
college, although we have private
colleges as well. Most of the stu-
dents lived either at home or with
relatives; there were no dormitory
facilities in our city.

I feel that dormitory life has
added to my college experience.
Most. of my close friends in Colom-
bia are those I had before I went
to school. Here, however, I've had
the opportunity to make new
friends mainly by living in the
dormitory.

At the Escucla Superior de Id-
ionias I had 50 hours of classes a
week because I was in the accel-
erated program, but the average
student has between 17 and 20.

Our classes there differed from
our classes here mainly because
there was more class discussion.
In general, though, students have
the same problems in both coun-
tries: exams, papers, making early
classes, etc.

Most of our social life in Colom-
bia was centered around our
church and family rather than
around school. Here on the con-
trary, because students are not
close to home, they have to extend
their activities outside their famil-
ies and church. Here they form
sororities and fraternities, and en-
gage in all kinds of extra activities.

Because of one of these activi-
ties, State Fair, I had the oppor‘
tunity to come and I hope that
your support to State Fair will give
another student the same oppor-
ttinity.

 

Dorothy Correa

 

To the Editor:

(in February 7 the State College
dinner menu degenerated to beef
stew. Yes, that nourishing puddle
of sour gravy with two gristly
lumps of meat per plate, and
meager lumps at that. This was
the latest of a series of memorable
meals. On January :10 we were
served chicken which, because of
poor butchering, bled profusely.
We re ‘till a meal of "lamb chops"
that should have been termed mut-
ton, if one can judge by the smell.
One expects to fill»up on bread and
vegetables on Fridays, but must
the same situation arise every
night of the week‘.’ At least we
haven't had food poisoning this
year, which may be attributed to
the fact that we have been unable
to “get the stuff down."

We feel that the $330 we pay each
semester for room and board en-
titles as to better food than this.
Is there no way in which the stu-
dents may el'l'ectncly protest? Now
that exams are oycr, no one can
rationali/c lt'llSltill to explain our
coiiiplziinl. lt. St'l'lilS ii reasonable
request that those in positions of
authority become familiar with the
situation and take steps to remedy
it

 

(Editor’s comment)

In a way, we are happy that
you sat down and typed up this
letter because apparently, you
are not the only people with
such a conipliiiiit~as indicated
several weeks ago,

However, we cannot do too
may much for you by our-
selves, except to print your

grievances and to remind you
that there are channels through
which you should take your
complaints.

The proper place is the ad-
ministration. (ii'aiitcd, neither
the President, nor the Dean
can have a constant parade of

students airing their com-
plaints. lint they will listen
when the complaint comes

through channels. 'l‘herefoi'c,
we suggest you start with the
Stiitleiit-li'aculty Committee.
