mean not only the committee in
the Senate itself, but felt that this
be extended to also mean commit-
tees outside of Senate. If elected I
intend to utilize this power. 1 would
like to see. these committees used
to discuss pertinent issues, such
as the possibility of group house
representation, an investigation to
define exactly what surplus is and
how it should be used, and an in-
vestigation of Rivalry, looking in-
to the possibility of reorganizing
some of its aspects.

One of the first jobs of the new
Senate is to organize the Student
Association Budget. This is one of
the biggest problems the new Sen-
ate has to face for two reasons.
First. a large majority of the new
Senate will lack experience in
government at State and will not
be acquainted with the procedures
of the old Senate. The second
problem is the lack of coin-
inunication between the Senate and

the budgetary organization. This is
one of the S. A. Vice President's
biggest jobs, i believe that the

tee of last year’s Senate will help
me in understanding some of the
problems that Senate must face.
Also, I was a member of Student
Union Board for a time last year.
This has acquainted me with some
of the problems the budgetary til”
ganizations face. The, big problem
in the organization is the lack of
transition in the budgets from one
year to another. To solve this I
propose to have a meeting of the
presidents and treasurers of the
various committees along with the
officers of these organizations who
made up the previous budget. 1 feet
that in this way the old officers can
acquaint the new officers with
some of the problems they faced
in making tip their budgets.

There are a couple of other
things i would like to see done.
First, l would like the schiccs

committee and the president of the
college to confer on the possibility
of having a separate government
building on the new campus. Sec-
ond I would like to see Senate and
Camp Board work together to pro-
mote the Camp Dippikill Day
which would serve to better ac-
quaint the students with the camp
and the progress going on there.

I trust you will consider quali~
fications, proposed impi'oyemctits.
and philosophies when you cast
your vote for Student Association
Vice President.
