STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FEBRUARY 10.

Dr. Vincent Schaefer Heads New Language
Expedition to Yellowstone To Enter State;

A scientific expedition to Yellow-
stone Park. consisting of eight sci-
entists interested in experimental
meteorology will be led by Dr.
Vincent J. Schaefer of the Science
Department at SUCEA.

The atmospheric scientists will
assemble at Idaho Falls. February
13. and the next day will travel by
auto to West Yellowstone. then by
snowmobile to the Old Faithful
Geyser Basin. They will spend the
following ten days in the geyser
area studying the unique subcooled
fogs and clouds abounding in the
area.

With each hourly eruption of Old
Faithful, it is possible to make a
new study or experiment. or to re-
peat one already conducted. More
than 200 separate opportunities. to
study and observe at Old Faithful
geyser and other geysers in the
vicinity, will be available during
the ten day period. Nature

Participants of the Expedition

The participants of the expedi-
tion have been selected for their
outstanding abilities in field re-
search. Each will specialize in his
particular phase of the atmos-
pheric sciences All studies to be
conducted are related to expert‘
mental meteorology concerned
with the physical properties of sub.
cooled clouds and ice crystals and
their reactions in the cold air of
the area. The visit will combine
both field research and informal
discussions related to the experi-
mental work underway and the
general scientific interests of each
participant.

Dr. Vincent J. Schaefer, who will
lead the group, is a research con-
sultant in Schenectady and a tee-
turer in science at the College. Dr.
Schaefer. while a Research Asso-
ciate at the (I. 1‘). Research Lab—
oratory working in the laboratory
of the late Dr. Irving Langmuir,
discovered a method for sci-ding
subcooled clouds with dry ice. This
led to the large worldwide effort
now being directed toward de-
termining the possibilities and
limitations of weather control. Dr.
Schacfer spent an exploratory visit
of a week in Yellowstone last \vin-

THE TAREYTON RING

NoExaminations

Some students have asked me if
I would teach them Sanskrit. I
shall be very glad to give some les-
sons in Sanskrit provided there is
sufficient number. Sanskrit is basic
to many of the Indian languages
and a knowledge of Sanskrit would
help those who want to learn some
Indian language later. I must, how-
ever. caution the enthusiasts that
it is a difficult languagcwlike Latin
or (Ircck. Only those who are seri-
ous about it should attempt it. This
is not a formal course. So there
will be no examinations, no cred-
its, and no grades. There are no

fees charged and no obligations of

any kind. The group will meet once
a week —either in the afternoons or
evenings—at a time convenient to
all. The text book to be used will
be Perry's Sanskrit Primer ft'o
lumbia University Press). It will
not be required for the first 8 or
10 weeks. Those interested will
please furnish the following infor»
mation on a 3x5 card:

Dick Robinson Inauguration Activities

Looks Back
And Ahead

Often, it is highly unfortunate
that we, as members of a race of
humans, must finish a task before
we can really appreciate the scope
of what the job entailed in the first
place. Since one must learn by ex
perience it seems, at least in the-
ory, that perfection may never be
attained in any large scale cndcav
or. Applying the above to the job
that I shall finish tomorrow, I

would like to express a few opin-
ions. neither biased nor those with
which all of you readers will agA
rce, but simply what I feel I have
learned while being the President

As I look back on the year that

things that I would have done dif-

have left for the nest man who

down as my specific recommenda-

tions' to thc commencing Senate.
All of thcsc will not be followed,
Some will proic inadequate and

if no use lllllt’I'S will ncvcr be

lully put together iiill not be cast

Senate began the 1960-61 legis
lativc year with only six members
returning from the previous ses-
sion. The pressure of government-
al dcniunds‘ soon turned this green
group into a scriousminded and
relatively efficient body.

The major part of Senate's time
during the spring semester was
devoted to the establishement of
a sound budget for the year. The
combined efforts of (,‘abinct and
Senate committees greatly cxpc-
dited the handling of the organi
rations budgets. The budgetary

was established as part of the

budget to cover unforeseen es

tion. The cntire process of budget
