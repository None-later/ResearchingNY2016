To Our Staff

People usually take the work the NEWS staff does
for granted. The credit for a good issue usually goes to
the Editor, while everyone but the Editor, it seems, hears
about a “bad” issue. But this week, we are placing the
credit directly where it belongs . . . on the staff. During
a change of Editors it is difficult enough to put out the
regular issue, but to put out two special issues in addi—
tion to the regular issues on two consecutive weeks, seems
impossible. We should like, therefore, to thank each and
every member of the staff for undertaking and accom-
plishing a monumental job . and doing it well.

One Man Show?

We are disturbed by the fact that only a single can-
didate ran for SA. President this year. How can anyone
be asked to believe that out of approximately 600 people
only one was eligible to run? That only one was inter-
ested enough to do so is obvious.

We are not casting stones at Dave Brooker; we salute
him for daring to run for an office which requires guts,
hard work, and devotion. But that such an undertaking
should require daring is an unhealthy Sign of our times.
It is an indictment of the student body for not getting
off their dead backsides and coming out of their very
little selves long enough to help keep student self-govern—
ment alive —— because it is dying. Yet these very same
people will spend upwards of ten hours a week over a cup
of coffee in the cafeteria. We know, it is considered
sophisticated to keep aloof from everyday affairs of State
. . . but all State really has is a kind of pseudo—sophistica—
tion.

Jules Feiffer once cartooned an election scene where-
in no one was nominated, and no one went out to vote
except one woman. She voted for herself. It sounds funny.
But it is frightening.

Snow Ball?

Our congratulations go out to all those who were involved
in the planning and execution of State Fair last weekend. It
is not often that we see such a fine turnout for one of our
functions at State so it was heartening to see the crowd that
did attend.

We have, however. a suggestion which some enterprising
State Fair (.‘ommittec might want to work on for future years.
The overabundance of snow in Albany this year has brought
to mind certain possibilities for State Fair. Many other schools
in the East have what is generally known as 21 Snow Festival—~-
so why not have something inclttdcd in State Fair along the
same lines‘.’ This would involve, of cottrse, a good deal of work
on the part of the Committee, and the plan would have to
be something extra as an activitynsince Albany‘s weather is
not exactly predictable However. such an event is not beyond
the realm of possibility, and in an area such as Dorm Ii'icld. it
would be interesting to see what sort of creations could be
concocted otit of snow. The winner could be judged in the
same manner as the Campus King is selected Hby the amount
of money people contribute to each snow figure.

Again. we realize this will involve a great. deal of work
but if the college is to grow as is ii'itended. it is time the
~;tudent body began to grow with it.

To the Editor:

The deplorable situation in the
Student Parking Lot proves that.
colleges students ltave no more
sense of decency or ethics than
“ordinary” people. Students have
been parking their cars with ab-
soltttely no regard for anyone but
themselves, sometimes blocking
the exit of thirty other cars. It is
impossible to cstitnate the number
of man-hours of frustration and
outrage that these self-centered
parkers have caused.

If everyone who is inconven-
ienced by these egotists would
take the trouble to complain to
the Student Personnel Office, per-
haps the school authorities would
correct this situation.

Thank you,
Stephen H. Burkard

 

To the Editor:

I wish to elaborate on the do
plorable situation existing at pres»
ent in ottr parking lot. Too many
people are inconsiderate of the
places in which they "park" their
cars. (And I pttt ‘park' in quotes.)
There are no longer any “thru”
anes where you can reach an
exit. If you leave your car in a
regular parking place, you will
usually find that you are boxed
in on all four sides when you want
to leave. This is especially trite
if you have any classes at the
NROTC or want to leave school
early. Also, many people are us-
ing the parking lot without per-
mits. It‘s not particularly fitnny
to have to push a car out of the
way or wait until someone comes
along to direct you ottt of your
parking place. I'm sttrc anyone
who uses the parking lot will
vouch for what I Itave said.

What can be done to remedy the
situation? (1) Perhaps some snow
could be -i'emo\’c(l, -thereby in
creasing parking area. (2) Per
haps the logs could be replaced;
this would indicate the area in
which we could park. (it) A few
fines imposed on the. illegal park-
ers would be. the best answer to
the whole situation; it Would sure-
ly be the most effective. But as
the sittiation now stands you never
know if you will have to remain
in school for two or three hours.

Something should be done to
improve oitr parking facilities and
should he done immediately;
iioi next spring or next summer.

Pledges and Sisters Voice Views on
Annual Sorority Council Help Week

IIcIl Night is over, "Thank
goodness," sigh botlt pltdgcs and
sisters alike. Althouin Ilelp Week
and [fell iiigltt are enjoyable
events, they are tiresome and
time-consuming for all concerned.
State College News conducted a
poll, asking pledges and sisters the
questions: “What is your opinion

of Ilclp Week” and "How do you
feel about lIcll Niglit"" ’I'hcsc are

some of the answers i'cccivtd
Sue. Byron: “llcll Week" it tcr

ever clean up after llcll \iclit"”
Nancy llavis: "Ilcll Week is
harder on the poor sisters than on
the pledges If they only rcali/cd
that llIt' sisters have to be c\'ci‘_\

What better way Is there to meet

Iain-flan Jt.ncs: "Ilcll Week in

big difference between this etty

lies in the fact that it's never “Just

“still Winter." And the only balloon
