Beat FDU 20-l6

At long last the Albany Frosh
wrestling team has broken the long
string of losses that ltas plagued
them in previous matches by de-
feating a strong Fairleigh Dick-
inson squad, 20-16. The little Ped‘s
previous record had been 0-5, while
Fairleigh Dickinson’s was 61.

The decisive bout in this match.
as itt many other Frosh and Varsity
events this year. was the last with
lloward Blum wrestling for State
iii the 177 pound slot. The score be-
fore this botit was

Albany , .. .. .. 15

Fairleigh Dickinson . .. 11

However. since State would for
lcii the heavyweight bout, the
score stood Iii-15 in favor of lsttil'r
leiglt Dickinson. Blunt had to win.’
llowie's anxiety began to tell as
he lost points to De {\Iuro in the
first period, putting him behind
until halfway into the third period
llowie gained two points oti a re-
vcrsal. fought his man to his back
and pinned him with a reverse-
tielson arm-bar. 'i‘he lt‘t‘osh had
won their first match. 20-16.

By BOB DAVIES

Maybe I‘m some sort of a State
t'ollegc Cassandra or something
like that. btit I predicted an excit.
ittg match against Farleigh Dick-
inson last week and nobody be-
lieved inc—except the wrestlers. of
course! When my prediction came
true last Saturday. attd was rc-
peated on Wednesday, there were
only a handful oi' spectators pres-
ent, 'l‘he Varsity Wrestling team
has now clinched a first time win
hing season by beating ly‘ralcigh
Dickinson and Yeshiva. 21-16 attd
21-8. respectively.

was won very decisively as a re

The Inside Track

Publicity Department
Needs Revamping

By SKIP GEBIIARDT I I
I have heard many comments this year about the

     

 st” i. -'

poor

attendance at Page Hall for State's home games. It seems
to me that the blame rests not on any one person‘s shoul-
der. but. rather that there are a number of factors that
enter into the situation.

In the first; place I can not blame anyone for refusing
to sit in the bleachers at Page and subject themselves to
the contortions necessary to watch the action on the floor.
Unfortunately there is nothing that can be done about our
physical plant at this time. and I feel that it is a waste of
time to consider the relative merits of our team using other

f

acilities.

I would rather consider the communication system
that we have between our athletic department and the stu-
dent body. At this time our sports publicity is left entirely
to interested students at the school and as a result there
are times when the communication of sports events to the
student body leaves muclt to be desired. This does not mean
that. it is the fault of the students. The job of publicity is
a large one and cannot be done efficiently by a student car—

tying a full load of subjects. The job is a tedious one and

carries little recognition from people other than the coaches
and sometimes the players.
these jobs are not actively sought after by any large
number of students.

Considering all of this I can scc only one possible solu-
tion, that is for the Student Association to grant money

to the sports department for tltc purpose of promotion.

This means of course that

 money would be used to pay two student assist»

to the regular student managers of tltc indiv1dual sports.

This was, at one time, the way that sports promotion
was handled btit it was discontinued for reasons not now
available to me.
