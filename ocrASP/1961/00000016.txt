i(.‘ontiitiicd from Page 1, Column 2!
A “It” (Unsatisfactory), means
that the student has performed his
student-teaching unsatisfactorlly.
This grade will not. be considered
acceptable for credit toward grad-
uation, and the student receiving
it will not. be recommended for
certification or a teaching job.
The Education department of the
college studied this situation for
approximately one year, and made
the recommendation last fall that
the usual grading system be abol-
ished. The reasons are that, on the
whole, they did not feel that. they
could differentiate between A, B
and C students. Also, that student
teaching should be a course in
which a student. should not be work-
ing for a particular grade.
Apparently, a number of people
agreed with these opinions. be-
cause upon the recommendation of
the Education department, the
Academic (‘ouncil approved this
new system. (The Academic. (‘oun.
cil consists of approximately 30
faculty members who act as a
group in determining academic
policies of the college).
As most other grading systems.
this system may also be considered

The next meeting of the

ard I". Smith. Professor Harry
Staley of the English Depart

to have both advantages and dis-
advantages. The advantages, first
of all, may be that this basis .of
grading eliminates the D, or in-
between, grade. Also. some of the
grade pressure that some students
encounter when they enter student-
teaching will be removed.

Disadvantages of this system are
that the 1) student now receives
a U (Unsatisfactory) grade, and
students with an average below a
2.0 will not be allowed to student-
teach. Also, outstanding students
will no longer be easily recognized.

it may interest some students to
know that State college originally
had an S and U grading system for
student—teaching. However, in 19110,
the AB(‘DE basis was established
in our college.

Dean Lanford also stated that
the possibility of including a trans-
cript of previous college grades
in the placement folder is present-
ly being considered. This was one
of the recommendations of the
lt'liddle-States Committees. Actual-
ly, in most instances, a prospective
employer has not been in contact
with transcripts. However, there
has been a detailed report on the
student's performance in student
teaching. This will also continue
to be placed in the folder with the
S and U system, and also if the
transcript will be inclmlcd.

The Inside Track

Better than the
Average Tournament

By SKIP GEBIIARDT   .

Ever since the State University Tournament began in
1957, Albany has been eyeing that coveted trophy and each
year it has slipped through our hands for reasons too numer-
ous to mention in this short space. In previous years
certain teams have dominated the competition but a look at
this year’s record indicates that the winner will be partly
the best ball-club but mostly the luckiest.

Here are some the assets and liabilities of our team.
First assets:

(I) Rebounding—our team has the greatest potential re-
bounding team entering the tournament.

(2) Defense—Again we have the greatest potential of
any team.

Couple these with a tournament-wise team (Cohen and
Bowen have seen action in nine different tournaments),
possibly the best bench of any team except for an adequate
Cohen replacement, tremendous spirit, and the ability to
come from behind, and you have the makings of a possible
wmner.

Liabilities: We will play on a large court instead of the
cracker-box; our defense leaves something to be desired
against a fast, running team (consider the Oswego game); and
last but not least, we are a hot and cold team. The odds for an
Albany victory: 8-5, take your choice.
