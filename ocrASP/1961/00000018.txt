Senate

Brooker Names Heads;

Record Attendance Set

By JIM DOUGIIERTY

A thought provoking quote credit-
ed to George Shaw has set the tone
of the new Student Association ad-
ministration headed by David
Brooker. “Remember, our conduct
is influenced not by our experience,
but by our expectations," was the
most note-worthy utterance deliv-
ered at the first Senate meeting of
the current session.

Expanded Attendance

A double portion of government
personnel was present at the first
meeting. In addition to the thirty—
three newly elected Senators. mem»
hers of the retired Senate as well
as well as past and present Mys-
kania members and the most re-
cent President of SA were present
to add a feeling of experience to
the meeting. It was indeed a grand
feeling to realize that the current
Senate boasts twelve hold-over rep»
resentatiVes-—tlie greatest number
in four years.

Review Of Operating Rules

Retired SA President Richard
Robinson annotated the past Sen-
ate‘s operating rules and offered
several suggestions for possible re-
vision. Following Robinson's deliv-
ery, the Senate moved to operate
under the "0ch” rules until a re-
vised edition can be prepared and
approved.

Initial Appointments

President Brooker took a portion
of this first meeting to announce
his first Cabinet and Senate com-
mittee appointments. The follow-
ing persons were approved for their
respective positions: Minister of:
(.‘ultiirc~—Anne Smith; Recreation
~Gary Jones; Religion Natalie
(,‘lark. The new Senate committee
chairman are: Constitution—(Iarole
Sherman: Elections—Pat Winow-
ski and Ted Duscnenko: Finance
—Bctty Klein; Rules—«Roy Knapp:
Services—Geri Schleifer and Dick
Kelly.

Brooker suffered his first legis-
lative set-back when his appoint-
ment for Minister of Special Days
was rejected by the Senate.

The six remaining t‘abinct posi-
tions are scheduled for appoint-
ment at the next meeting. Sl‘otlkt‘l‘
also stated that two persons will
be appointed to fill the existing \a
('ancics on the Athletic Advisory
Board.

('ulture Responsibility

On February I7, 1960 a bill was

passed in Senate providing for the

This phone would be used to accept

Less Formal
OralReading

Classes Start

Monday afternoon, March 6, the
first of a series of eight oral read-
ing classes will be held in Draper
349 from 3 p. m. to 4 or 5 p. In.

In the past, oral public readings
have been held at State; however,
they have been on a production
scale with a great deal of prep-
aration and coaching.

The classes that will begin this
year are intended to be more in-
formal and will require not quite
as much preparation and a limit-
ed amount of coaching. The
purpose of these classes is to es
tablish something that is informa-
tive and entertaining which the
students and faculty members may
take advantage of without feeling
that they are obligated to attend
every meeting.

The people who will be reading
are doing it as part of their oral
interpretation course. The litera-
ture to be read will range from
short stories and novels to essays
and poetry.

Marlowe's ’Dr. Faustus'

The Cleveland Players, recogniled as the professional
acting ensemble in the nation, will present Christopher Mar-
lowe’s “Dr. Faustus” tomorrow night at 8:30 in Page Hall.
The performance here is a part of a 38-state tour, made possi-
ble by a Ford Foundation grant in I957 to further the produc-
tion of professional live theatre around the United States.

An enduring theatre classic, Dr. Faustus is an eloquent
recreation of the legend of a man who sells his soul to the
Devil. Written in the Middle Ages, the play is a reflection of

the popularity at that time of

Four Indonesia

Grad Students
Study at State

By DORIS MUIIIJCII

Althouin it may be unknown to
many State students, Indonesia is
represented at our college by four
students enrolled in our graduate
program. These four students are
Mr. (iarnadi, Mr. Lie Tiong Djicn.
Mr. Tan li‘ay Tjhion. and Mr. Ru-
seffciidi.

Iiach of these men is a school
faculty member in Indonesia. Sonic
have as many as twenty years of
teaching experience gained in their
own country. They are studying
here to acquire their Master's de~
grees in Education. and also Mas
tcr's degrees in their particular
subject areas. After acquiring
these degrees, they will return
home in two years and Will then
bccome heads of education pro»
grams for all of Indonesia.

Educated Students

Mr. (Iarnadi, who came to AI-
bany State in January. previously
studied in the field of Biology. lie
is the author of several texts which
he wrote while in Indonesia.

Mr. Lie Tiong Diicn came to
State in September. Ile has a Mas-
ter‘s degree in ('hemistry which
he received after studying in IIol»
land. (lnc of his important contri-
butions to Indonesian education is
lhc adoption of a Science kit Used
in ('heiiiistry, important for its or
iginality in that field in Indonesia.
He will study during the next two
summers at MI 1‘.

Mr 'l'an I’ay 'I‘jhion also came to
State in Scptciiibi-r. llis liliiltil‘ field
is Library Science. and he has
written many articles concerning
this particular area. He Will also
further his study during the follow
mg two summers, at the Library
of t'ongrcss iii \‘i‘ashmgton, I). t‘.,
and ilic Huntington Library in Cal—
il'oriiia

The youngest of the four sltidcnls
is Mr ltiiscflciidi, only 2‘.) years
old llis major area of study was
Miitliciiiatics. and he is ilic Assist
uni Ilcad of the Mathematics dc
parimciit in the I'iii\ersity of III
donesia lie is striiiiig for a '\Iiis
li'l' s degree in l‘itlllt'ulltill.

I'Iacli of these men speaks at
least two languages, and some as
many as five Iaiigiiagcs. 'I‘hcy at'c

stories concerning man’s con-
tracts to the devil. This theme was
used by (Iocthc in his epic “Faust”
and also formed the base for (lou-
nod's familiar opera of the same
name

In Marlowe's play. Faustus is a
Doctor of Theology willing to sell
his soul to gain superhuman power,
possession of infinite knowledge
and the ability io probe the mys-
teries if the universe Ile hopes
to have power equal to that of (Iod.
The price"? Iivenmal damnation.
I’aiistus' skeptical reaction to this
price is merely "I think llell's a
table ”

“Was This The Face?"
l’ci'haps the most familiar lines
in the play are contained Ill Ifaus‘
ius' reaction to Helen of ’I‘roy—~
"Was this the fact that launched
a thousand ships.

“And burnt the topless towers of

lllium‘.’

"Sweet Ilelcn. make me immor-

tal with a kiss."
An “Angry Young Man"

Hire of theatre‘s most infamous
playwrights. (,‘hristopher Marlowe
was considered the "angry young
man" of his day. He was a rebel
against t't)ll\t'llllt)llal learning, and
when he wrote this masterpiece at
the age of :4, he may \chI have
injected his own personality into
the character of li‘austus. lie was
still a young man when he (lied in
a tavern brawl at the age of thirty.
