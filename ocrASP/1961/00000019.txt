To the Editor:

It is rather apparent that the
Commissioner's Tournament has
certain inadequacies. Namely:

1. Lack of official tournament

referees making it necessary to

use spectators who may be or
become biased because of friend-
ships or obligations.

2. Lack of an official scorer and

tiinekceper again making it nec—

essary to use spectators who
could be biased

These inadequacies were evident
in the semi-final round of the (‘oin-
inlssioners 'l‘otirnament (Sayles I
vs. A.I’..\.i Due to the lack of of-
ficial referees it. was necessary to
use spectators who appeared to
have insufficient knowlttlge of the
fundamental rules of basketball
and also appeared to be influenced
by remarks made by players,

It was also necessary to use a
scorer atid a timekeeper who were
closely associated with one of the
teams. This proved to be a I)l't'~
carious situation since there was
a discrepancy as to when the game
officially ended.

This discrepancy resulted iii in
decision between the ttiiiekeeper

Focus On Faculty

For a great many State College
students majoring or tninoring in
social studies. contact with Miss
t‘athcrine Newbold has been both
rewarding and tinforgetable. Miss
Newbold has been on the college
faculty for 15 years and is familiar
with almost all aspects of school
and student activity.

Education

She was born and brought tip in
lx'easautpia, Iowa, a small town in
the southern part of the state near
the Missouri border. After high
.s't'lltuil, Miss Newbold attendetl the
l'iiivt-rsity of Iowa where she was
awarded a [3A in English. At col-
lege. she covered social events for
the school newspaper and was the
college tennis champion fora year.

When she lett college. Miss .\'ew-
‘.-ild taught dancing iii Iowa for
s. e \ era I years and she later
cliingetl to stit'ltll studies in the
Iowa school system. She tlteii at-
tended t'ornell l'niversity to obtain
her M S iii social studies and took
a teaching supervisor's position at
Miami l'niversity in Ohio

Study and Teaching

served as advisor to Pi Gamma
Mu and Forum of Politics in addi-
tion to giving colorful and stimula-
tion interpetations of American and
world history to her students.

In 1955, Miss Newbold was grant-
ed a Fulbright scholarship for
study in Europe. She spent a year
at The llague in the Netherlands
where she engaged in study and
teaching. In 1958, Miss Newbold
was awarded another scholarship
for a year's graduate study at the
University of Michigan.

Research Project.

At the present time, Miss New-
bold is engaged in a vigorous re-
search project toward her doc-
torate in history. Site is tracing the
extent to which Lincoln's foreign
ambassadors were endowed with
anti-slavery sentiments for politi-
cal purposes. Miss Newbold says.
“Research is a lonely business and
I like people, bttt it is also very
satisfying. I hope to finish my

thesis before I lose my (‘ntllllSl'

siasm has taken her to many

not a healthy one. Both workers and customers are subjected
daily to the sickening fumes which cover every available sur-
face——not only with smoke, but with a fine, slippery, clothes-
spotting layer of grease. We suspect that in the near future
the Student Guides will have to discontinue taking prospec-
tive entrants and their parents to see the Union—both out of
shame and fear of losing them in the swamp-like mist!

We hate to sound flippant about this matter, but the
situation has reached the point of absurdity. Even the most
hardy appetite evaporates before the menacing “Smease”

to get the money for such fans.
