pia and Nigeria.

All members are urged to attend
the program as well as all inter-
ested students and faculty incin-
hers.

Refreshments will be served.

Great Decisions

Last week the Great Decision
groups voted on the United States
policy in France and the majority
concensus is that there should be
a continuing integration of Western
Europe in the framework of a
larger Atlantic integration. More
progress in unification of the two
economic groups is urged.

There is a definite feeling that
further equalization should be giv—
en to all nations participating in
the policy planning in NATO.

The majority of student ballots
expresed a need for settlement in
Algeria. Some students felt that
greater pressure should be applied
on France, while others supported
a liberal search for settlement in
France.

Fortyseven per cent shooting

accuracy and the most aggressive
defense of the current season gar-
nered the Feds an impressive
twenty-seven point victory over
dangerous Broekport in the last
game of the regular season.

Five lIit Twin Figures

Five members of Dick Saucrs'
squad ripped the nets for double
figures. Jim ()ppedisano led the
array of accuracy with 17 markers
with Don (.‘ohen pushing through
13 in addition to grabbing 25 of
the teams 50 rebounds. Jim Greene
had a hot hand and netted six of
nine from the field plus two free
throws for a total of 14. Roger
Casey, who was married the after-
noon of the game, hit for 12 and
Sherwin Bowen added another 11.

Defense Makes Difference

Itrockpoi't came to Page gym
with a 12-4 record, top seed in the
State Tournament, ati average of
82 points scored per game and a
shooting percentage of 52. This
satnc teain left Page (lym with
a 12-5 record. and second seed in
the tourney. The western New
Yorker's hit only 33'; front the
field and managed to net otin 68
points against the outstanding dc-
fcnse displayed by (.‘ohcn and Co.
The Feds intercepted no less than
10 passes in sporting to a 42-28
halftime lead. The rest was all
gravy for this team that has its
sights set on the NAIA Regional
play—offs and a chance at the na-
tional finals.
