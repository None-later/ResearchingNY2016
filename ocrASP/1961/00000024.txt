Peace Corps
Raise Query
By Students

The Peace Corps plan recently
put into operation by executive or-
der of President Kennedy has been
the focus of college conversation
for the past few weeks. Students
on the whole are enthusiastic
about the idea, but there is a ques-
tioning attitude on the part of most,
primarily because they are uncer-
tain of the Peace Corps' real func-
tion, what its program involves for
possible recruits, and what its po-
tential for success is.

The public information office of
the Peace (forps has recently issu-
ed a memorandum prepared by Mr.
Sargent Shriver, director of the pro-
gram, which answers many of the
questions that have been asked
concerning the Corps.

Operational Work

The. essential idea of the t‘orps
is the placement of young Ameri-
cans in operational work in aiding
the development of needy countries
in the areas of teaching, health,
agriculture, industrial protects and
government administration. it is to
operate as a basic oniponent oi our
whole overseas program. Skilled
manpower to develop these needy
nations will be recruited l'roin pri»
vate orgalii'z'nllolis, colleges and
lliliy't‘t'Sllii's’, l'. S. (hivernmcnt ag
encics, t' N programs. and direct-
ly administered programs with host
(titllill'll‘fi.

Nationwide Selection

The volunteers will be selected
on a nationwide basis, The t‘entral
Ser\ice will process applicants and
serve as a central placement cen
tcr for volunteers for world dc
velopinent.

Terms of Service

The terms of service include an
assignment of two to three years
length depending on the relative
difficulties and needs ol' the pro
jet-ls. They will be given a ll\ltl:‘,
allowance sufficient to provide a
minimum decent standard of liv
ing.

Initial I‘illiplltISlS on 'l‘eaching

The initial protect oi the i’eace
t'orps will place the emphasis on
teaching. Successful national de
velopineiit's most important base
as Mr Shriver has pointed out. is
literacy and high levels ol linowl

A complaint alleging racial discrimination with regard to
the admission policies of the Milne School has been filed with

this complaint has been confirmed by Peter Libassi, Albany
