Chinese Student Contributes PresidenfCo/iins

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, MARCH 17, 1961

Chinese Theatre Prop Exhibit Will Address

By LENORE GITTLEMAN

As one walks into the main read-
ing room of the library here at
State. this week, he cannot resist
being attracted to the glass display
case which stands at the head of
the staircase leading to the lower
level of the library.

In this case is an exhibit of
props used in the Chinese Theater.
They were contributed for the dis-
play by Mrs. Ping Win Shen, a
native of China. who is doing
graduate work in Librarianship at
State.

Mrs. Shen, who fled from the
Mainland in 1947. has much to say
about the background of her col<
lcction and the Chinese Theater.

One of the most distinguishing
features of the Ancient Chinese
Theater was its lack of female ac-
tresses. All roles were played by
men who dressed in the costumes
of the people they are portraying.
It was considered a disgrace for
women to act. and those who did
were deemed to be of low status.
This is still true of the theater to-
day, which prefers to keep the
classical tradition.

Most of the dramatic presenta-
tions are concerned with tragedy
and opera. This is particularly true
in the Northern provinces where
Mrs. Shen‘s husband. who is an in-
structor of mechanical engineering
at R.P.l,. came from. These pieces
are few in number. however, and
are repeated over and over again
as classics.

Another feature of the Chinese
Theater is its lack of elaborate
scenery and complete lack of fur-
niture. except for a door and gate.
All emphasis for decoration is
placed on the articles which are
either worn or carried. These
props, which make up the display
in the library, are both symbolical
and useful.

The black Mandarin cap is used

to indicate the person portraying a
young male role. Made of silk bro-
quadc and embroidered by hand,
the cap was also worn by the old
man in China until 50 years ago
as part of his usual attire.

A fan. which is hand-carved and
painted and made of cedarwood,
is used by the feminine roles in
performing theatrical gestures.
They were once used by women of
the aristocratic class in old China.

The black hand-carved mask,
which is made from the redwood
tree. is used to indicate the villain
whose appearance in the plays of
China are as a frequent occurence.

A hand-painted lantern is carried
by the maid or servant who accom-
panies the leading lady. Up until
50 years ago, the people of China
used these lanterns as a source of
light. by sticking candles into them.

Background music which was
traditionally supplied by skillful in-
strumentalists has come to be of-
fered in the form of records.

These articles on display are
some of the attractions which tour-
ists may find in Formosa's cultural
institutions. They can also be seen
in New York City when Chinese
Theater companies present plays
throughout the year at various in-
tervals in Hunter College and City
Center.

Mrs. Shen prepared this exhibit
as part of her work in the Non-book
Material Class which is required
of Library Science students. She
was assisted by Mrs Margaret
llarr

(ltlicr displays arranged by stu-
dents in this class can be found on

bulletin boards in and outside a
display case in Richardson 379.
There is also a display case in

Richardson 380.

Math Adds

New Courses

Dr, Ralph Beaver, Chairman of
the Mathematics Department. an-
nounced that three new courses
will be added to the curriculum
for next term. The first is a
special honors seminar which will
be open to approximately ten jun-

iors and seniors upon invitation
only. This course. which will be
taught by Associate Professor

Paul Schaeffcr for six credit hours,
is designed for those students who
desire an opportunity for individ-
ual study in Mathematics. Class
discussion will consist of rcports of
this individual investigations. The
first semester may be also taken
for credit without going onto the
second

The other courses being offered
next term are a three credit topo-
logy ('ltlss‘ for graduate students
to bc taught by Dr. liarncy and a
three of six credit advanced calcu-
liis class with Dr. licavcr as the in
strut-tor.

Priority Groups

Milne is an academic high school
geared to use as a practice-teach-
ing laboratory by students of the
College of Education. This in itself
is a built-in restriction, since the
program offered is not appropriate
for all students. Dr. Collins further
adds: “We give priority to broth-
ers and sisters of present students
and also to sons and daughters of
State University faculty members
and administrators. This is a fringe
benefit designed to help attract
and keep personnel."

Actual Situation

Although the complainant alleges
that refusal of admittance was
based on racial discrimination, the
facts of the case indicate that any
person applying under the same
circumstances would have been
denied admitlance-iregardless of
race or color.

in December, a list of 36 boys
and 36 girls was submitted by Dr.
lt'ossicck to Dr. Collins as those
studcnts who had been accepted
for enrollment in the seventh grade

as of next September. In early
January, the parents of these stu-
dents werc notified that placement
procedures and scheduling would
start immediately.

In late January, the complainant
entered the Milne School and re-
quested that her daughter be reg-
istered in the school for the next
year. Acceptance was politely re-
fused on the grounds that the class
quota had already been filled. Her
daughter, however, was placed on
a waiting list already 115 names
long and informed that future ad-
mittance was very unlikely because
of the already lengthy list of wait-
ing students. There is also a list of
99 boys waiting for admittance.

it is standard for parents desir-
ing their children to attend Milne
to submit an application very
early. The earliest application for
next year's accepted class was
made in 1953 and the latest in 1957.
it sccms quite reasonable, there.
fore, that it person requesting ad-
mittance only nine months in ad-
vance might well he refused. The
complainant. even under these veri-

fled circumstances however, chose
to file a complaint with the State
Commission Against Discrimina-
tion.

SCAD Procedure

To date there has been no offi-
cial notification made to the col-
lege that stich a complaint has
been filed with SCAD. Official no-
tification, however. is not a stand-
ard practice with the Commission
until procedures and direction of
investigation have been outlined.
Mr. l.ibassi states, “What we do,
generally, with a complaint is have
a representative call on the re-
spondent (in this case Milne) and
discuss the charges with them. A
careful inquiry is made and the
entire procedures are suggested by
the respondent."

SCAD Chairman lilmcr A. Carter
has named J. Edward Conway of
Alhaiiy as the investigating officer
for the Milne case.

Mr, l.ibassi assures all concerned
that “when our investigation is
made, every effort will he made to
impartially reach a fair conclu-
sion."

it was discovered further that no
discussion has yet been made with
Milne because no decision has yet
been made as to how SCAD will
handle the case “There are some
cases ahead of it on the list."

l.ibassi could offer the News no
additional information on the facts
bccausc "SCAD attempts to avoid
publicity in these matters. ()nly
onc other case was ever publicized
and the Commission as a policy
docs not divulge any information
at all "

Millie Dcfeiided

lidviard l“. lx'cnncll. Director of
the Albany inter-Racial Council,
has defended Milne and Dr. Collins
by stating that the complaint "is
absolutely in the wrong from my
knowledge of the school, and Dr
Collins is certainly not prejudiced
wlicrc race is concerned.” Kcnncll
adds further in defense that “any
Negro or White cannot expect a
student to be admitted in a period
of one year when others have been
waiting. 11 would not be fair to
someone who has an application
already on file."

The Long Wait

With the publication of this story.
lllt' cntirc incident will most prob
ably rapidly fade out of the public's
sight. From here on all proceed-
ings will be conducted behind the
secrecy of the State (.‘ommissioii.

l'rcsidcnt Collins sums up the
publicity of the matter in stating.
"i regret the public attention
which has been called to this
charge When the facts are known,

i hope that similar attention will
be given to the findings."

Dr. Benton, well acquainted with
the work done on conservation in
New York State, takes a firm
stand on the recent Northway
issue. “The Northway is opposed
by conservation organizations be-
cause forest preserves should be
primarily reserved for specialized
recreational activities for which
they are suited: hiking, fishing.
and camping. and for wild life
which can't survive in close prox
imity to people. The placement of
a major highway through the cen-
ter of the preserve would tend to
draw in more organized means of
recreation which could be situat-
cd anywhere.“ lir. Benton has been
writing a book dealing with the
preservation of natural areas.
