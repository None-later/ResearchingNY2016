A Letter

To The Editor:

l’l agree completely with your feelings about grades for
practice teaching. According to the 1960 edition of “American
Colleges and Universities“ there are sixty members of the
Education Department at State. Surely some must be capable
of iudging whether a teacher is superior, good, average or
unsatisfactory.

Teachers are supervised constantly in good schools. They
are rated. They are even fired when their work is unsatis-
factory. We have even reached the stage of rewarding the
superior teacher financially. What is wrong with pressure?

The State College Education Department admonishes
secondary schools to do research before they act. What re-
search was done to substantiate the dropping of grades for
practice teachers? When was the research undertaken? How
much significant research has been completed by the sixty
members of State College's Education Department while
members of the College’s faculty?

Many secondary schools are striving towards excellence.
They need help. They particularly need help from new teach-
ers who genuinely want to teach, are well prepared academi-
cally, AND ARE NOT AFRAlD OF PRESSURE AND WORK.

Very truly yours,
Myron J. rindsberg,
District Principal,
Webutuck Central School.”

Thank you, Mr. Rindsberg. Well, it looks as if a wary
eye is being cast in the direction of the State University
College of Education at Albany.

ln Protest

The burden of whether or not to charge tuition at State
colleges has been placed on the shoulders of the Board of
Trustees, and as yet, there has been no decision made. We
have listened to many pros and cons from students, legislators
and people in the street. The general consensus seems to
have been opposed to the bill. Students at other State schools
have held rallies in protest — rather than taking the more
effective measure of petitioning the legislature. During a
rally in Geneseo, the President of the college, Dr. Monech
made the pointed comment: “This is fine for Geneseo, but
they can’t see you in Albany.”

We have this to say now, to the Governor, to the Legis-
lature, and to the Board of Trustees: If we could afford tuition,
we would probably be in another school. If tuition is charged,
with whom are you going to populate the new campus? Surely
not us. if the bill to give State Grants to private school stu-
dents is passed, should we consider ourselves discriminated
against? Also: Why did the protests of both taxpayers and
students go unheeded? Or does this legislature no longer
derive its authority from these people? Finally: Taxpayers
will be paying this tuition, taxpayers will be paying the grants
to private school students, and taxpayers will be paying their
taxes. Fair?

Here, in Albany, they can SEE us. Will they HEAR?

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, MARCH 24, 1961

Dear Editor,

We have just returned frotn at-
tending the State College Band
presentation under the direction of
Dr. Stokes in Page Hall. We would
like to express our appreciation to
Dr. Stokes and the band members
for their performance. We enjoyed
the various musical selections and
we felt that a concert of this type
should be presented more than
once during the school year.

This one o'clock musical pres-
entation provided a worthwhile di-
vergence from the usual daily rou-
tine of classes. We hope Dr. Stokes
and the band members were not
discouraged by the small attend-
attce and will consider another
showing in the spring at this saute
hour. It's too bad that many stu-
dents were unable to attend the
fine prescittation.

To the Editor:

In connection with last week's
article, or rather series of equivo-
cations, concerning the Penn State
Debate trip, I believe that several
additions and footnotes are neces-
sary, and it is for this purpose
that l have ,iotted down the follow-
ing comments.

I would agree tltat it is sensible
that next year's officers be elected
from the corps of capable speak-
ers who won speaker awards. The
"little teachers colleges," however,
did jell together to get a dunce into
office, as was so aptly phrased by
last week's author. This particular
duncc happened to be the only win-
ner of the speaker award from the
"big university" of Navy! This
post, by the way, was the same one
which last week‘s author sought.
Not only did she not win a speak-
er's award, btit she might be re-
minded that when given the chance
to speak, her over-abundance of
emotion and lack of accuracy un-
wittingly destroyed a well taken
case that had been previously es-
tablished by her minority.

tlnc last point is necessary. ()ur
coalition was comprised of ASTC,
lrockpot‘l Slate, Allegheny ('ollege
tiiot a teachers college), Delaware
t'nivcrsity (not a teachers college).
and Navy (NOT a teachers col»
lcgc).

Now, in connection with otir "ag-
gressive freshman," who la st
tteck's author describes as inex<
pericitced I must mention that he
is a transfer from MIT. that has
done extensive formal debating in
high school. To my knowledge our
coach whom I was seated next to,
\tilt't‘tl no explicit preference for
the post of nominating committee
member, which our author, sitting
four rows in front of us, claims he
did 1"iirtherniorc, any blunders, as
interpreted by otir author, made
by this "ti;.§gi'cssi\'e freshman”
might have easily been avoided by
proper advice and cooperation
from otir more "experienced incin-
lit'l‘ N

there are many valuable assets
associated with experience at a
debate congress, only one of which
is the actual debating prowess
gained by the participating mem-
bers The author of last week’s
article concerned herself with only
a secondary importance, that of
"Status Seeking." So the vine was
too high, therefore, the grapes are
sour.

DONATIONS RE('EI\'ED
How can the hierarchy iccl justified in burdcning tltc students ol
the State (‘ollcgcs with tuition" We ask this very basic question
because:
I. Matty students come to State because they can't get an educa»
tion of such high caliber in tuition schools.

[0

Too many students are burdened with part-time Jobs which
interfere with their studies.

.i. Under the present system there are not enough loans or scltolut‘
ships available.

If the Board of Trustees decides on a tuition, more and more of
us will be turning to macltinc‘gun methods of raising funds.

REVUE

If the posters are any indication of the quality of the State (‘ollegc
Revue to be presented tonight and tomorrow night, we arc clad that
we got our seats early. We couldn‘t have got them late if we wanted
to; the show was sold out three hours after tickets went on sale.

['1’ IN THE MORNING

Next Saturday morning we‘re going to get tip at tilt- :i in. get
dressed, go up to I’n‘ul)acher. and scream "We want to go to to Dawn
Dance!" It‘s too bad that you frosh will be deprived of the unusual
spectacle. Unfortunately, the careless acts of a few lizivc spoiled lllc
fun for the rest of us.

NEW IDEA

it's time for a change. TGIF-ing at the (‘,'1‘. is dying a slow but
sure death. ’l‘hosc interested students who are concct'ticd with this
great tradition should attempt to hold the club meetings at a new ltlt‘lL
tion. A mass exodus is the only way to rid otn‘seltes of thc lotid mouth
ed Indians and strengthen State‘s sttitlt'tils' weakening limit of follow
ship.

/(,'t)lifi)llll'l1 from Pitt/I 1.
colleges in New York State, iii-
cluding units of the State Univer»
sity. the community colleges, and
institutions in the New York (.‘ity
-ollcgc system.

Inasmuch as this action would
raise the charges for the great ma
,iority of full-time students in the
colleges involved and might it.
some cases impose difficult linair
cial burdens on students of ll'illlt‘tl
means. the committee also propos
ed the following. that tuition re»
bales be given automatically to all
 average. or better. students
from families with less than $5,000
a year and to other hardship cases.

Trustees Recommendations

Included in the Master Plan of
the Trustees of the State l'niver-
\ity of New York issued in Febru-
ary, 1961. was the recommenda-
tion that the amount of tuition be
fixed or approved b; the Board. It
stated na‘ in making its determin-
ation, the special lees now charged
students should be reviewed and
revised so that the total paid by
students for tttition and other fees
be fair and reasonable. Although
the 'I'rnstccs favor its general tip
plication, they did not commit
themselves to the specific amount
recommended by the lleald Coni-
iiiittee.

(lne of the principles observed
by the 'l‘rustccs in their judgment
concerning tuition is that the dis-
tinction between \arious courses of
study at the undergradttate college
le\cl is no longer valid. Also, the
present tuition policies effective
throughout the unions units of
lIlLillt‘l‘ learning in the State Uni-
xcrsity arc lllt‘i)li~lSlt‘lll anti irra-
lltillill.

President Hamilton t'onccrned

Although it may appear that the
l‘t‘t‘tilllltlt'lltlttlltillS of tlic llcaltl
f‘ommittcc .iiid lltliil‘tl of 'l‘rustces
may become effective. there is
hope that they will not. The opinion
of State t‘ollcgc students is being
considered III the following way.
