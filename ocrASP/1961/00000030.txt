Tie for First

Volleyball has now been going
on for over a week. Willi about
one-third of the season behind
them, the teams are coming on
strong.

in the first league, there is
good race for first with all the
other teams in a tiglil pack. Kappa
Beta and the Saylers are tied for
the lead. APA. three Potter teams,
and the Knights, representing The-
ta Xi Omega, are close behind.

Sayles leads the second league
with a three to nothing record. The
Kobras. Waterbury, and the APA-
lhctics are running second. in a
third cluster are the Ghosts, Ki}.
Aces. APAches, and One-eyes.

This weekend will see league one
teams really fighting for first be-
cause lltc first place teams have
tough schedules. The Saylcrs have
two games and first place depends
on the outcome.

The Commissioners would like to
remind all team captains that any
player who is not on the roster
cannot play for the team. if a team
uses an illegal player. it automatic-
ally forfeits the game. Will all cap-
tains please check the bulletin
board for changes in the schedule.

"A Challenging year!“ With this brief and highly non-
commital remark, Bob Burlingame—Varsity baseball mentor
——sums up his views on the rapidly approaching diamond
campaign. The 1961 edition of the Ped baseball team will be
more than adequately stocked in the battery department. but
will be questionable in most other respects.

BASEBALL OBSERVATIONS

Pete Spina, holder of the State strike-out record. will

return t'or his fourth season on the mound Pete regis-

 

tered five of State‘s seven victories in 1960 . . . Chuck
Recesso, always noted as a clutch performer, will be return-
ing to assist Spma on the hill . . . Chuck garnered the remain-

of 1 year ago, will be counted on heavily to bale the front-
line moundsmcn out of trouble if they should encounter any
-—-and they probably will . . John Pavelka, will handle the
catching chores l'or the second year, although he is being
hard pressed by newcomers Gary Penfield and Dick Mann

. Joe Burton, shortstop. is going to be seeing a lot of new
faces in the infield . lnfieldcrs Don Neel, Jerry Gilchrist
and Dick Lewis are all missing from the 1961 line-up . . .
Jim Brown amt Joe Poziwicz will return to the outfield but
will sorely miss centerfielder Ray Haver Burlingame
