Artist — Mr.‘ Robert Marx Modern Dance Kelly and Woinoski Direct
Exhibits Paintings of Nature To Revise Old '65 Frosh Handbook Staff

Ry ARLEEN EMERY

Mr. Robert Marx, the artist
whose paintings are currently on
exhibit in the Draper gallery, is
a highly sophisticated painter. He
has a clearly developed and indi-
vidual style and he handles his var-
ious media with extensive techni-
cal skill.

Subject: Nature

i‘ie chooses Nature as his subject,
probably because of his extended
association with the earth during
his boyhood. ilis father was a
landscapist and Marx spent many
hours in the woods and fields of the
estates which his father worked on.
His resultant familiarity with Na-
ture is obvious in his Work, but he
is not merely a representative
painter of landscapes. In fact, he
does not seem to be as concerned
with depicting the land, as he is
with communicating its effect upon
man.

"Man Within Nature"

A persistent motif in his work is
"man within nature.” His vague,
almost unrecognizable human fig-
ures are an integral part of the
places around them. Some paint-
ings are totally devoid of human
life; but they transmit an impres-
sionistic image of the earth. “Win-
ter Landscape #2," for example,
is empty and lonely, a human be-
ing’s emotional expression of his
response to the universe.

Narrow Range of Colors

Mr. Marx usually limits his pal-
ctte to a narrow range of colors,
giving each painting a single pre-
dominant hue. The cool blues are
good for expressing his frequently
felt loneliness in nature, (“Winter
Landscape" and “Edge of the Sea’
are almost entirely blues and
whites). but he sometimes uses
enough of one of the more ViVid
hues to create a dynamic effect.
"The Cave :2,” for example, has
a great deal of energy in it, intro-
duced by Marx's use of red.

Some of the canvases display a
clearer integrity of forms than
others; "'l'he ObserversH and "The

r Notice

p.in. in the Waterbury Maui

itroadway and jazz. Topping
the list will be a stereo record-
ing of “The 1812 Overture,” the
original cast version of “West
Side Story” and "Aeida."

 

Cave #2” are less vague, more ob-
viously concerned with shapes and
form than the landscapes. Yet
these paintings are no less success-
ful in transmitting the artist’s re-
sponse to the world of man and
nature.
Prints and Charcoals

There are several prints and
charcoal sketches included in the
exhibit. The prints display a strong
design quality and are quite unlike
the paintings in mood. The char-
coals are rather delicate, and one
in particular “Shadow Images" is
a beautifully finished drawing.
