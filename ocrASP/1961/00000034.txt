an increased growth rate anti size
when applied to various higher
plants.

British Workers

British workers have tested bac-
terial and fungi with negative re—
sults, it has been published that
"no convincing action of gibberel-
lins has yet been shown on any
organism except higher plants."

proved these statements when he
grew moss spores in mediums con-

gibbercllic acid. There was an in-
crease in the rate and percent of
germination proportional to the
concentration of acid.

l'larbara Rutenber is carrying

tlte necessary data which would
permit the report to be published.

The procedure called for sowing
spores in petri dishes containing
mineral nutrient agar.

Different concentrations of the
acid were then added and the spore
solutions sterilized.

Seminar Equipment

As part of their seminar requirement. the twelve grad
uates have selected specific problems involving the habits
and functions of plants or animals. Through observations and
experimentations the students will arrive at the how andthc
why of life phenomena. The seminar report on their finding.s
carries the possibility of being published in scientific journals

The research the graduates are undertaking is important
for two reasons; itot only are they making important contrtbu

SECRETS OF NATURE

Hydra Responds

'l‘he hydra is a minute fresh wa-
ter animal, found attached to the
stcms and underside of submerged
leaves. The body is a vase-shaped
sac with the mouiu a: the upper
end surrounded by from five to
eight tentacles.

Living or Dead

flow the hydra can differentiate
between living and dead prey has
become ati object of interest in the
last few years. The hydra possess-
es neither a brain nor any sensory
organs such as eyes.

lteccnt research has indicated
one possible answer. Reduced glit-
tatliione could be the agent respon-
sible for the initiation of the feed-
ing response in the hydra.

termine at what concentration by»

’l‘wo species of i’sium were found
to aggregate red blood cells. Upon
absorption with type () cells, one
species was found to be almost
speficic for A and the other for 15.

Donald I’uttlitz is attempting to
make these extracts entirely spe-
cific for types A and B by dilution
and by cells of the interfering type.
