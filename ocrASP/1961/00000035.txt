STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, APRIL 14, 1961

 

Gmmm’ca‘iuu

 

Dear Mr. Frankonis:

I have two objections to the opin-
ions which a Mr. Rindsberg ex-
pressed in the March 24 editorial
column of the News.

In the first place, I am not so
certain that the “S-U" grading
system for student teaching will
“lower standards.” The “grade”
that means much in student teach-
ing is the rating on the standard
evaluation form. This rating goes
into a student's folder in the Place-
ment Bureau. Since 1941, I have
been judging student teachers, us-
ing some forin which attempted to
describe good teaching perform-
ance. In my opinion, the present
evaluation form yields a clear de-
scription of teaching behavior. If
a student teacher can receive an
“outstanding” from two competent
judges on this form, he ought to
feel well rewarded. In what other
course in this college is a student’s
performance observed by two or
more trained observers and rated
on a standard form which was de-
veloped from many hours of re-
search? In addition, this student is
further evaluated in a written
statement of from 100 to 300 words.

In the second place, I object to
Mr. Rindsberg‘s sweeping general-
ization about the absence of signif-
icant research in our Education
Department. The publication rec-
ord of the department for the years
1959-1960 is as follows: twenty~cight
magazine articles, six bulletins, six
books, three monographs. The
books deal with such subjects as
educational television, secondary
school curriculum, reading in the
secondary school, junior high
school guidance, special education
of the physically handicapped. How

familiar is Mr. Rindsberg with the
specific contents of this output? If
Mr. Rindsberg is familiar with
the specific research reported
in these publications, then I would
be interested in his definition of
“significant research" as applied
to these publications in a carefully
documented review of the material.

Gnantilleka, a 4/12 year-old
daughter of B. D. B. Appuhamy
and Dingiri Amma claims to have

Trustees Announce Policy
Of No Tuition for 1961-1962

The State University Board of Trustees announced on
April 13, 1961 that a decision concerning the tuition policy in
our State colleges has been reached. THERE WILL BE NO
CHANGE IN THE TUITION POLICY OF THE COLLEGE OF
THE STATE UNIVERSITY DURING THE l961-I962 ACA-

DEMIC YEAR BEGINNING IN

SEPTEMBER. The Board said

that colleges which have not had tuition will remain tuition-
free at least during that year while those which have charged
tuition will continue to do so. However, this announcement
does not apply to the community colleges which are under

the jurisdiction of local boards

of Trustees.

As reported in a recent issue of the NEWS, the Governor
and the Legislature approved legislation giving the State
University Trustees authority and responsibility for establish-
ing a tuition policy in all of the state-operated colleges of the
University. Following this, the Board decided that there would
not be a determination on general tuition policy until detailed
studies had been completed and full consideration given to all
of the factual information available. Adequate advance notice
