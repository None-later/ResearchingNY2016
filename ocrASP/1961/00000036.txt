Are We Prepared ?

Realizing that State College will one day be changed to a
liberal arts institution and that the education department will
naturally undergo some change, it nevertheless seems im-
portant to mention the apparent need for clarity concerning
preparation for teaching in junior high schools.

In education courses little emphasis is placed on these
grades. Then Senior year comes. Many of the student teachers,
perhaps almost half during some quarters, teach iunior high.
They cannot do their best because they have inadequate
preparation.

Then when the former practice teacher becomes a full-
fledged member of the profession, he may be teaching senior
high. Isn’t it probable that he would be better prepared to
teach senior high if he had done his student teaching in that
field.

If Albany State prepares teachers for only grades nine
through twelve, there should be no student teaching in grades
seven and eight, and graduates should not be qualified to
teach these grades.

If the college prepares teachers for grades seven through
twelve, more emphasis should be put on junior high, and
students should be allowed to do their practice teaching in
the grades they prefer.

Fasciast Ghost?

It seems almost incredible that it should happen here,
but it is happening. The John Birch Society—a group of almost
fanatical “conservatives,” extreme right-wingers who have
vaulted themselves into prominence by means of a concen-
trated campaign of mudsling and blatant name-calling——under
the guidance of Robert H. W. Welch, an ex-candyman, has
suddenly blossomed, as an organization devoted to ultra-
nationalism. Such was the start of one Adolph Hitler, in a
Munich brauhaus, over a quarter of century ago.

John Birch knows nothing of this society; he died ten
days after World War II —— shot, bayoneted fifteen times at the
hands of a Chinese Communist lieutenant, and then left on a
garbage heap. But John Birch has posthumously lent his name
to this Society (so typical of his nature) because John Birch
was an arrogant man who believed that his college professors
should be reported to the authorities if they leaned anywhere
to the left of his brand of ultra-Nationalism—even at the risk
of ruining a life.

The John Birch Society functions: calling Eisenhower a
willing tool of the Communist Party; Truman, Lippman, Mur-
row and others "pinkos." The Society cannot and should not
be repressed by any governmental agency. Any organization,
however, which advocates unproven name-calling, Fascist-
like spying, and suppression of a free press, can and ought to
be censored by the hammer of public opinion. The narrow
Nationalism of the John Birch Society is frighteningly akin to
Hitler’s doctrines, because of which so much American blood
spilled—and yet the Society continues to gain support.

Open Letter to the
Student Body:

Recently, there appeared in the
State (‘ollege News an editorial to
the effect that Senate has been
loafing with regard to the proposed
State t‘ollege radio station. That
is not so. The staff of the station
is not in a position to formally ask
Senate for assistance, In fact. the
staff of the station is itot in a posi-
tion to do much of anything, Why'.’
Simply because of insufficient
membership it is well and good
that people say heartily. "A radio
station would he certainly a great
thingI for State t‘ollegc,“ (food We
think so. too. So do a large number
of Senators as well as past and

good wishes do not make a thing
come to pass. In order to have

need you. it will be necessary to
