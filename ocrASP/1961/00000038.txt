The Saga Of

A BELATED SPRING STORY

STATE

An Addict

By MIKE FEIGEL

I CAME, I SAW, I LEFT

Hey, Man, I met Hubert last night, (you know, the Existen-

tialist dwarf) and he told me that he couldn’t kick the habit.

Well, see man, when Hubert was nine years old, he had to eat

ice cream so he ate popsicles. Well, Man, after that, like he

Man, like

this stud had an iceberg on his back. The cat would get high
on popsicles and within a short time he was eating thirty or
forty a day. This pusher who worked in a candy store used

Well, after a while, he started buying them by the carton and

this stud would get sent so far out by popsicles that he always
carried one with him, and on schooldays, he would carry one
in his back pocket so he could eat it between classes. This
arrangement worked out solid except that once in a while the

Oh, yeah, but like his cleaning bills were kinda high. Well, one

day he got sick of it all and he went to a hospital to take the
cure. He stayed there for a couple of months and there, with

to sell them to him.
Bysshe: Man like where did he scrape tip the scratch?
Percy:
popsicle would melt in his pocket.
Bysshe: Man, he must have had the coolest pants in town!
Percy:
the aid of adult supervision, he licked the habit.
Bysshe: But I thought he couldn‘t kick it?
Percy: Now, don‘t bug me man. like this story isn’t finished yet.
Bysshe: Oh.‘
Percy:

So, like I was telling you, llubert licked the habit and for the

first couple of months he was living like any Bourgeois, lead-

ing a happy life.

Then one day he was double crutching it

along Beat Street and he saw a popsicle stick lying on the side—
walk. Well, man, that started him on the kick all over again
and pretty soon he was devouring over fifty popsicles a day.
Then one day some scientist says that eating too many pop-
sicles causes cancer of the left nostril.

Bysshe: (aside) Methinks this cat is pulling my leg.

Percy:

World -Wide:

Revo/ t Crushed;
JFK: Sympathy

By BILL FRANKONIS

Originally, this column began as
a survey of sotne important world
and national news. btit shortly be-
fore deadline, catne the word from
Cuba: “The revolt has been crush-

ed." These words are sickening
echoes harkening back to 1956.
when a similar message issued

from Budapest.

The invasion of t'uba by anti-
t‘astro revolutionaries was a long-
awaited, much-discussed event.
When finally, on April l7. a band
of about 2.titttt incn began the inva-
sion. many people expressed con-
cern that the invasion was prema
turc. that the indigent under»
ground was not fully prepared. The
qtiestion such speculation raises is
simply: In what way w'crcn‘t the
anti-(‘astro forces prepared‘.’

On April 19 it became evident
just how woefully unprepared thc
anti-t‘astroites were. lland weap-
ons and obsolete 13-29 bombers are
in no way a match for modern So-
vict .\ligs aitd tanks the prices of
which. it is fairly ccrtain, are be
yoiid t'uba's foundcring economy.
When t'astro first began his catn—
paign against the t’nitcd States. it

was pointed ottt that Russia was
attempting to make ('uba the
l'nitcd States" lluugai'y‘: instead.

days ago, it seemed plain enough
to t-\eryonc that thc t‘uban invad-
t‘l‘\ needed assistance not in inun-
tit-rs. but in arms and supplies. But,
oycrtly at least. no aid was forth»

Corner - - -

By R. DAVIES

l 47 About a week ago. a list was posted on the A.\llA bulletin
()titilt-rltivlllltl out it there was enough interest in intercollegi-
ate lldtk to warrant the starting of a team. To date about
twenty-seven persons have signed up. A meeting was called
last .lucsday to begin organization of the team. elect com-
missioners. and settle questions such as what tvpe of conr
petition should be initiated. '

 

the routine for starting a sport on the Varsity level has
been established by the AA Board. The first year niust be one
of intramural competition recognized by the AMIA. If there
seems to be enough interest in the sport. it mav be presented
to the AA Board for recognition. lt inav then i‘cccivc a budget
schedule iitatchcs or scrimniagcs with other colleges aiidhdo
everything a Yarsity team can do except award ailetter The
following year the clttb may be given full \‘arsitv status if
interest warrants this. ‘ .

Four years ago. an attempt was made to start a track
team. At tlte'start the interest seemed great enough to war-
rant rccogmtton as a Varsity team. A budch was given. about
two thousand dollars worth of equipmcntwas purchased amt
meets were schcdttlcd with Rl’l aitd l'nion. Almost as soon
as the project got. off the ground. it collapsed .'

The meeting held last 'l‘ucsday' mirrored enough interest
to warrant action on a team. It was mentioned that current
interest seems greater than that of previous years. Meets are
to be scheduled for May iit hopes of making this year qualify
as the intraittural year. An abundance of cquipnfent is avail—
able including about thirty pair of track shoes. hurdles. shot
discus and other necessary equipment. all in excellent condi:
tion.

.-\rrangemcnts have been made with the Albany lligh
track coach for combined workouts with Albanv lligh. ‘a team
much tougher than ltl’l‘s or Union‘s. All those wanting to
work out with Mr. Reckct at l’ilcckcr Stadiut‘n. should obtain
a physical check-tip from the .\lcdical Office (‘omlitioning is
a vital factor for the success and safety of participants. There-
fore. anyone considering entering a meet should make sure
he is in good coiiditiou beforehand.

’l‘hc success of the fountlliitg track team depends upon
two factors: active participation of interested athletes and
spectator support, Neither of these two are enough for suc-
t't'SS by itself btit depend upon each other for success
