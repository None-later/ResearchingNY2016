()ne of the primary concerns of
the group is the “sniease” situa-
tion in the Student Union. Dean
’l'horne related that a fan has
been purchased and conditions will
be greatly improved in the t'nioii
after its installation
The committee inquired about
student concern of sparse cafe-
teria space. It was then disclos-
cd that additional chairs and
tables will soon arrive to be placed
in lower llusted. Other school im-
provements under consideration by
botli Sei‘v’ices Committee and the
administration: the planting of ivy
on both Waterbury and Alden
llall; plans to landscape and
beautify the patio between Alden
and Waterbury Hall; the place-
ment of bleachers on Veteran
Field, and Sunday evening hours
for the llawley Library.

The committee has been suc-
cessful in having logs placed in
the student parking lot to aid sys-
tematic parking, and through the
work of (‘ampus ('omiiiission. the
parking problem will he alievated
by the issuance of student trullic

the final problem to come to
the attention of both Dean 'l‘hoi'ne
and the committee was the dis-
reputable appearance of the t‘oin

oitt clean-up effort is needed on
the part of the entire student body.
and measures must be taken to ill
'»'.!t‘t' its cleanliness once it is re
