Through the maze of glass tubing. Edward Walsh '20 is viewed

operating an ion exchange column to separate 'ations.

Research is the by-word which underlies nearly all the
work the graduate program in chemistry entails. Most of the

students carry out an original research investigation under
the supervision of a senior staff member. The results are often
published in the current literature; several student papers
have been presented at national meetings of the American
Chemical Society for their outstanding accomplishments.

Another important aspect of grati-
tiate work encompasses the aware-
ness of important developments in
tlte science field. The seminar aitns
to serve this ftinctiott.

Outstanding Speakers

During the past semester the
chemistry department has brought
to the seminar tltree outstanding
speakers from beyond the tricities
area and four from industries and
educational institutions of the area.
These included Dr. Alfred B. Gar—

rett, Dr. William Dickinson. atid Dr.

Walter Lawrence.

Focus

Iiy LINDA LASSELLE

There was once a little boy who
didn't like school He lived in an
“ugly little town" in Pennsylvania.
But the countryside was beautiful.

Then this “unteachable” student,
named Theodore Adams, grew up
and entered the University of Roch-
ester. Ills whole attitude changed.
He was "fortunate enough to real»
ire the merits of the school while
actitally attending it.”

In fact. he liked college so much
that he wanted to major in every—
thing. Since this was impossible,
he settled for study iii only piano,
geology. philosophy, French. and
I'Itiglish.

Work During (‘ollege

To work his way throuin college.
Mr. Adams held two very different
yobs first he was a stock clerk:
then he went on to a bettcthpayingI
job as ati expeditor for the Cast-
itiati Kodak t‘ompanv. IIc fotind the
latter position rather difficult.
however. for it consisted of being
"extremely nasty” to people itt ef-
forts to get tnore work done faster.

Itccaiise he worked every other
year during his college career, it
took the future professor seven
years to complete his degree rc-
qiurcmcnt. In his last year of col-
lege Mr. Adams married a fellow
student a science major.

Mr. and Mrs. Adams then at-
icnded t) It i o State tiniversity,
where Mr, Adams obtained his

master‘s degree atid did his cottrse
work for the doctorate.
First Teaching Position

"A lively. citified school” is the
dcscriptioti he gives for the college
in which he and his wife taught for
the next seven years.

\tr Adams commented that he
did not consider the University of
IIttft'an one-tenth as good academ-
ically as Albany State. Ile feels
that there is a great deal of inlet-
ligence at State (‘ollt-ge, among
littlil students aitd faculty.

After these seven years of
teaching. he returttcd to Ohio State
tor graduate examinations itt prep-
aration for his doctorate. ('onccrnr
in: his graduate stttdy, Mr. Adams
observed that lie ltad planned to
hate II but actually found Itiitiselt
loving it However. graduate work
wasn't quite as t'Xt'lttttg as he ltad
always pictured it.

Influences
