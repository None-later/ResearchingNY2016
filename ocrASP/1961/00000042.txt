My track article of last week covered the mechanics
of starting a sport and their application to the new track
team. The rapid-fire action that has taken place during
the past few weeks now seems to be taking effect in the
form of an intramural track team.

The members of the team have selected Lynn Costello,
’63, and Paul Slusar, ’64, as the track commissioners in
accord with AMIA regulations. Lynn and Paul have con-
tacted the AMIA board and have received recognition for
a track meet on Saturday, May 6, between 11:30 am. and
2:00 pm. This is in the afternoon of Moving—Up-Day.

In order to facilitate the scoring of the meet, the
commissioners have set up three teams using the fraterni-
ties, men’s dorms, and off campus students. Each team
is to appoint or elect a captain who is to prepare a team
roster, including players and events entered. _These lists
are to be turned in at a meeting of all captains and the
commissioners on Monday, May 1. The rules and regula-
tions governing the meet will be decicled‘upon at this time.
Concerning prizes, individual awards Will be made to the
first, second, and third place winners in each event.

The team has been working out in Bleeker Stadium
for the past few weeks. Workouts will be held each after—
noon at the stadium under the supervision of the Albany
High coach, Mr. Becket (except when there is a conflict
with a high school meet).

Track is one of the oldest and most highly developed
sports known to man. It is one of the few sports capable
of holding the attention of the entire world. A listing of
the men and women who have become almost legends in
their own lifetimes through track would exhaust pages
of print. Yet with all the glamor that track cxc1tes,
State College does not as yet have any 'claim to one.

Track is a sport requiring great time and energy.
It is not a sport for weaklings. This new track team is
an excellent opportunity for individual as well as group
recognition. A team may receive acclaim as a potent track
team, but the individual is the most important factor in
the world of track. If you decide to come out for the track

team remember, the level of your success will depend en-
tirely upon the amount of effort expended. If you. want
to figure in on State College's track team, now is the
time to act! .

The track meet is only a week away, and there is
not much time for preparation to date. If you want to
participate, contact one of the commiSSioners. Then start
working out. Any equipment needed Will  issued to
you at the equipment sheds on Veter‘anstield. If the
tournament is a success, State will have its track team
by next year. Everyone who comes out and enters the
tournament. will be helping to get the team into orbit.

tie for best ball, to garner 1%
points for the Sauersmen, In the
individual matches, Casey, in the
number one position, succumbed
to the pressure of the tight match
and lost to his opponent after lead-
