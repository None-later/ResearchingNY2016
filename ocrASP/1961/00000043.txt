Bear Baiter

By lIAENLIN and FEIGEL

 

Please do not understand (us) too
quickly.—-—~Andre Gide
Somewhere between one B.C.

and one A.D., Christ was born. In

476, Rome fell. In 1939, World War

II was declared. In 1941, Haenlin

and Feigel were born. And it came

to pass that in 1961 a new frater—
nity was formed at State.

But evil minds will triumph, and
rumors began to circulate that this
new fraternity, RKO, was not really
new after all, but was the result
of an insidious plot by API to es-
tablish a farm team.

If this is true, God forbid. then
we can easily imagine what will
happen. In time, every fraternity
will have its own farm team and
the entire structure of IFC will re-
semble that of Major League Base-
ball.

The following are excerpts from
the tninutes of an IFC meeting
sometime in the future. By this
time such practices as: inter-
fraternity trading, drafting, and
subsidization of high school stu-
dents will be firmly established.

The scene opens on IFC Com-
missioner Keenesavv Mountain Vila
li calling the meeting to order.

VILLl: This meeting will now
come to order. Will the secretary
please read the minutes of last
week's meeting?

SECY.i Commissioner Yilli open-
ed the tnceting at 7:30. The min
utes were read and the meeting
was declared open for old business.
SPS again requested permission to
establish a new franchise. After a
brief discussion the topic was re-
tabled until the next week. RKO
then refused APl's offer of ten vet-
erans, and three political losers for
one Wt'lL'ill lifter. YMCA turned
down K("s offer of five waiters,

three hoarse Statesmen. and a
campus king for nine baseball
players. This ended old business.

New business: YMCA asked for
a decision on whether it was legal
for Rocky Quisling to refuse to play
for them after they had bought
him from SP8 for an undisclosed
sum. The topic was tabled pending
further research. Al’l then offered
two crooked score-keepers and a
retired stage - manager f or the
YMt‘A rail. Sl’S then offered their
whole fraternity for a new fi‘an
chise and a case of llcdricks. lioth
trades were reiectcd by the conti-
cil. One trade did go through. ho‘m
ever, concerning faculty advisors.
SI’S accepted [it"s offer of five bi-
ology professors for three l'Inglish
professors after they threw iii two
gallons of wine. The meeting was
adyourni-d T 1.") and the repre-
sentatives all went drinking lic-

ration Of Tutition

lly MARY LOL' EISENMAN

In a meeting with Dr. llamilton,
President of the State University of
New York, at his home on April
27 Dave Brooker and Steve Coti-
dojani, St't‘lCA President and Vice-
l’resident. and the other ten
'l‘cachers Colleges, l)r. Ilatnilton
disclosed many reasons for the
Board of ’l‘rustees' consideration of
the 'l'uition 1511].

Action on the bill is a definite
possibility for various reasons. It
is known that higher education has,
for a long time. formed some set
tuition pattern. for instance, SUNY
colleges such as llai‘pur. Long Is“
land, and Medical schools have
charged a tuition rate from $100-
3100 since 19118. This is because
these colleges did not form until
after the 1948 StTNY consolidation.
Also, the cost of higher education
has been greatly lessened by the
t'ommunity colleges where the stu-
dents bear one-third of the cost,
the community. one-third, and the
slate. one-third.

We must then face the question
often asked. "Why, then, should
Stale 'l‘cachet's t‘ollegcs be treated
differently,” The reasons utidcr
lying this question are many. A
student at Nassau pays a $300 tui-
tioti and a l“t|l‘lllill1§(ililt' sludeiit
pays none, yet their chemistry cur-
ricula are identical. Since the in
come of a college graduate is $200,-
titit) more during his lifetime than
a non college graduate. is it un-
reasonable to ask why a student
cannot afford to pay tuition in the
long run'.’ Also, because of the iii-
creased cost of higher education,

half of the tuition is "if the tuition
