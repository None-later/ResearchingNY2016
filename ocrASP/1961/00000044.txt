“Moving-Up-Day” or MUD?

Probably one of the words that a student frequently hears
used when first arriving at our college community is the word
“tradition.” In most instances, when first heard, it does seem
meaningful—-however, it appears as though it is soon after
merely considered as being a word composed of three sylla-
bles.

According to statistics which have been formulated by
various members of our administration and faculty, the fresh-
man class enrolled each year is composed of Students out-
itanding in scholarship, leadership, and service. thus, it is
difficult to understand why students with such high qualifi-
cations in these three categories appear to lose interest in
the importance of college activities and the traditions included
therein. Certainly lack of interest has been exhibited repeated-
ly in the past, particularly in activities and college functions
which habe been traditionally upheld.

“Moving-Up-Day” typically exemplifies a tradional func-
tion which has in recent years become an ocassion on which
little interest is exhibited by the students of our college. It
appears as if this function, consisting of three words, has be-
come as insignificant as "tradition," the three syllable word
which it represents. Is this a coincidence, or is it substantial
evic ence that th .- tr 1dit.  . 
real significance for us?

Saturday morning could easily prove the latter as being
true. However, it may just as easily result in being an
occasion which will substantially make amends for the poor
attendance and interest that has been prominent in the past.
It is an event capable of determining whether or not active
leadership, service, and student participation exists on our
campus.

“Moving-Up-Day” may become MUD in only a few hours;
however, in those same few hours this day may again be re-
stored to its original position, a position ranking high on our
own college list of events and symbols representing “tradi-
tion.”

Fifth Weekend Arrives

The academic year of l960-6l has resulted in many
changes on our campus. A few of these include the change
in tuition plans, campus site plans, and finally, inter-fraternity-
inter-sorority relationship plans.

IFC~ISC has previously succeeded in some of its attempts
to improve the status of relationship between sororities and
fraternities. The future may result in an even bigger step
towards the improvement of these relationships. The future
being considered is one not so far in the distance. In fact,
THIS weekend includes planned events on which all fra-
ternity and sorority members can once again prove that they
are adults and capable of assuming responsibility. ALSO, it is
a chance to exhibit respect for and sociability towards mem-
bers of all other sororities and fraternities.

lFC-ISC Weekend can turn into just another weekend,
or it can become something for which we can look forward to
enjoying and participating in each year. Enjoying it this year
will require participating in it this year. Standing by and
looking on is not enough, and remaining within the same
tightly knit group made up of those who wear sweatshirts
with the same Greek letters is not enough. This is not the pur-
pose of such an event.

This lFC-ISC Weekend could prove to become an event
sponsored each year in the future. This first attempt at suc-
cess will be the foundation on which the building blocks can
be placed. Certainly if the foundation crumbles, the building
itself will not result in an existence.

Possibly another tradition may begin this weekend, an
annual lFC-ISC Weekend, and it could easily be a tradition
which is defeated before the battle for survival is even begun.

Last Wednesday evening, April
26, Dave Brooker, SA President,
and Steve Condojani, SA Vice-
Prcsidcnt, met with Student Gov-
ernment representatives from Pots-
dam, Plattsburgh, New Paltz, Fre-
donia. and Buffalo State Univer-
sity colleges at. the Hotel Welling-
ton to discuss the bill recently
passed by the New York State lcg~
islatttre which permits the Board
of Trustees of the State Univer-
sity of New York to initiate a tui—
tion.

The meeting resulted from polls
coitditcted at the various State col-
leges. which attempted to discover
the general student feeling about
the 'l‘tii'tion Bill. The representa
lives wished to meet to assimilate
poll results and to provide a uni-
ticd stand in policy against the
'l'uition ltill which was to be pre-
St'lllt‘tl to llr Hamilton the follow-
iitg Day.

Sl'NY Student Government

In attempting to formulate a tini-
l'ied policy, a proposal was made, to
start 1111 Association of Student
tlovernments of the State Univer-
sity f'olleges of New York. Dr.
Ilamilton, with great interest and
enthusiasm, consented to act as
advisor for the new organization.
It was felt that if each student
body hacked this Association, it
would mean strong representation
iit behalf of student body interests.

Business of Association

The first business attended to by
the new association was to deter—
mine whether the polls regarding
tuition conducted at the various
State llnivcrsity colleges were val-
id, aitd whether the questions ask-
ed were pertinent to the ’l‘tiition
Bill.

It was decided to accrue the re.-
sulis ol' the polls and compile them

'l'his move was made after a
careful study of existing residence
facilities with respect to reducing,

The new lift; bed addition to Wat-

in addition, certain of the small:

The change was untlcrtakcn in
order to facilitate current enroll-
meiit plus a larger freshman class

class will be women.
