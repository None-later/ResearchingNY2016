By R. DAVIES

The track team will stage its first track meet this Satur-
tlay at 11:30 iit Blocker Stadium. Through tltc work of the
team captains, there will be about 40-50 participants. if this
meet is successful, State College will be oit its way towards
havutg a Varsity Track team! '

’l‘he meet will provide the first recording of track records
at State College. Therefore anyone who comes out has a
chance to get his name iii the record book. Ribbons will be
awarded the winners, and runners up. The mile will not be
run because the commissioners feel that not enough condi—
tioning has been done. 7

The captains have been selected by the contitiissioncrs
for the organization of the individual teams aittl encourage-
ment of possible talent. These captains are: Team A, i’tTtli
Slusar, Waterbury, and Don t’ond. Savlcs: Team B (‘liuclt
llunter, APA, and Joint Lilga, EICI’; Team t'. Art lit‘tlttt‘iic, SLS
l’ete McDonald, KB, Dan Smith, TXU. Anvone interested iii
the meet should contact his captains. ltost‘ers will be turned
iii to the commissioners on Friday, May 5.

All students itot participating iii the meet should trv to
attend the meet if possible. Track may figure very ltioh III
the Spring sport‘s picture iii the future and the team iiecds
to feel that it can depend upon the student bodv for support
iit gaining this goal. ‘

Pershaps it might seem strange that such a new sport
sltoultl attract such attention. Some might comment. that since
track was trictl once at State, the same results will come to
this team. I ant confident that this will not be the case.

In the first place, the previous attempt to start a team
was begun directly on the varsity level. This resulted in an
all-or-itothiitg attempt wlticlt fizzled. llatl weather, lack of
sufficient interest, atttl other problems contributed to the fall
of the team as a failure. Attotltcr factor in this fall was the
demoralizing blow dealt to the team as a result of its scverc
defeat at the hands of art organized ltl’l team. Since the team
is now starting on an iitti'an‘iural basis. it will have a chance
to develop its potentialities and organize itself iitto a working
unit.

 

The events will be scored on a 53-1 point basis. Indivi-
duals will receive ribbons for first, second. and third place.
but no team trophy will be awarded.

ill the 220-yard dash. runners will draw for lattes and
the event will determine the procedure for the other running
events. The starter will pick the first place man \\'IlCllCVt‘T’

Study of Terms
Reveals Odds,

Screwy History

Have you ever wondered how
some of tltc terms used in baseball
originatcd'.’ This reporter was
thinking about it the other day aitd
decided to do some research iitto
the matter. The results are utter-
esting, if not startling.

For instance, iii baseball. the
bullpen, where the relief pitchers
sit around waitittg for their friend
to get knocked otit of the box,
draws its name froitt the Spanish
bullfighls. ’l‘he bullpen, oddly
enough, was itot witcre the bulls
were kept, but where the matadors
sat around waiting for their friends
to get gored. The relationship to
baseball is fairly OI)\’l()IlS.

Also in baseball, tltcre is the
tcritt tlugouf—wltei'ein tltc players
sit when their team is at hat, or if
they're not playing. Now dugout
is ait old ittdiait (American style)
word meaning "little-boat-wltich-
floats-upon-the - water-after-being -
hewn-out~of-an-old-log." At first
glance this scents to have no rela—
tioit to the baseball dugout~~hut
Mantle occasionally makes an ef-
l'ort to things sailing when be de—
cities to asault. the water cooler.

Still with baseball there is the
familiar term "on deck.” This of
course refers to the. player await-
ing his turit to but who kneels ill
a circle off to tltc side of Itoitte
plate ~~~ watching his best friend
strike out. The tcrttt was originally
a itatitical term, front "all ltaittls
oti deck"-~-but this was inconveni-
ent for baseball siitcc it would have
gotten crowtlcd with all ltaiitls on
deck ttlte deck circle is only a few
tcct iit tlianteter). 'l‘hei‘eforc, the
baseball moguls decided that only
one player would be oit deck at a
liittc. and that lie could kneel down
so he wuultlti't block the view of
the players III the dugout.

l"iiially, there is the term “t'lii-
nesc Iioitie run" which is the ittinic
gi\cii to a cheap homer (and there
are plenty these days). Now this is
obvioust an Hi'icntal term and it
Is very strange how this got into
baseball in the first place. it seems
that iii an effort to justify the
World Series the league presidents
decided to gue the game an inter-
national flavor. This is only the
first of tuany phrases. Next year
we’ll see llussian Itoulctte--~which
involves three pitchers throwing at
the same time - btit only one of
them will have a ball.

State to Oppose Brockport
By JIM DOUGHERTY

Tomorrow afternoon at two o’clock, the Ped diamondmen
i“ will take the field at Bleecker Stadium in the first of two
' doubleheaders scheduled for this season. Tomorrow’s opposi-
‘ tion will be provided by the Golden Eagles from Brockport
State. The western-New Yorkers will be facing the pitching of
Ieft-handers Pete Spina and Dan D’Angelico in addition to a
balanced Ped hitting attack. In the past, Brockport has always

Albany; but, Spina (2-1) and

D’Angelico (1-0) are prepared to put their records on the line
against the power-packed Eagle line-up.

UTICA FALLS TO SPINA FOURTH TIME

Monday Pete Spina extended his career record to I6 and
I0 in a two-hit performance against the Utica College Pio-
neers. This was the fourth time in as many years that Pete

has collared this same team. The
unfortunate fact of the matter is
that l’ete lost ltis cltaitce to ntake it
