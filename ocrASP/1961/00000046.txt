Display Status

In the recent self-evaluation re-
port of State prepared for the Mid-
dle States Association of Colleges
and Secondary Schools, the College
did a thorough appraisal of its ob-
jectives, organization and admin-
istration, library. finance and fa-
cilities, special programs, student
personnel services, faculty and
teaching, students and outcomes.

In the spring of 1960, 4133 students
were named on the Dean’s List. 263
on the Probationary List, showing
there are more successful students
at the College than non-succesful.

Many students at this College
work to help pay their expenses.
During the summer of 1959, 72%
of the 1959-60 enrollment earned
sums from $100-$900. During that
college year, 4t)’« of the students
worked at regular part-time jobs,
and many more worked irregular-
ly as baby-sitters, sales clerks,
house cleaners, etc.

Faculty

In 1956 about 40’V'o of the teachers
in U. S. colleges and universities
held the doctorate degree. At
State we have 52"? with Ph.D. or
Ed.D. degrees with many profes~
sors having completed all require-
ments for doctorates exeept the
dissertation.

Withdrawals

Regarding withdrawals 76.6‘57»
take place during the first two
years of college. During the fresh-
man years. slightly more than 21%
of the original entrants leave (7.2%
the first semester, 14.2”; the sec-
ond).

During the Sophomore year an-
other 17% (21"? of those who begin
the Sophomore year) leave. In
the Junior year only 8% (11.3"?= of
those who begin the year) leave
and in the Senior year 3.7% (7.2%
of those who begin the year) leave.

The number of men who with-
draw slightly exceeds the number
of women who do. Sixty per cent
of the student body admit having
considered withdrawal at one time
or another. Their main reasons
were: discouragement, loss of self-
conidence, and dissatisfaction with
the College.

’l‘hey attribute withdrawal by
their acquaintances mainly to aca-
demic dil'iculty, romantic plans or
problems, and change of vocational
objectives. Academic difficulty is
the explicit reason in about 302': of
all withdrawals, but clearly under-
lies many more.

Alumni

A check of publications by alum~
ni, covering many years, turned
up 42 published books, both crea-
tive and scholarly, and uncounted
contributions to 59 periodicals.
Some graduates have entered gov-
ernment service often in a teaching
capacity; others have found teach-
ing jobs abroad, particularly in
the Near l‘Iast and Latin America

One has Won (‘aldccott Medal for
children's book illustration; one is
a college president; one is a dis-
tinguished llollyWood ’l'V director,
and so on.

What t:\‘ltleiit'l‘ there is supports
the statement that graduates usu-
ally fulfill the promise of their uii-
dcrgraduate records.

The Bear Baiter

By FEIGEI. and IIAENLIN

Scene: A room in Brubacher.
Three sorority girls are talking to
a high school senior.

Girl X (obviously the leader):
That takes care of the campus.
Now, is there anything else you'd
like to know',’ About sororities or
anything?

Senior: Well, you're in a sor—
ority. What requirements did you
have to fulfill'.‘

Girl X: Well. of course, we had
to have a minimum wardrobe of
15 pairs of knee socks and it) pull—
: 'cer sweaters. Then we had to be
,'._t)o(| looking, blondc, iiigratiating.
and have an it) of 75 or under.

Senior: 0h! ls that all"

Girl X: By no means. We all
had to have sparkling personali-
ties. and We couldn't be prejudiced
or different.

Senior: Well, it doesn't seem as
though you have much variety in
your group.

Girl X: ltut we do! l"or in»
stance. each year we pledge a girl
who is . . , well, intelligent and a
hard worker. This raises our EIH‘I‘
age and gives us a house manar
gcr We also annually pledge one
girl whose sole job is to build
floats. lTnt'ortunately, we had to
kick her out of the sorority this
year because we came in second

in Homecoming competition. So,
as you can see, we do have quite
a bit of variety—as sororities go.

Senior: Do you have a lot of
prestige, I mean compared to the
other sororities?

Girl X: Oh, we've been on top of
the pack for years although we
did slip a little until we too, got
a girl who could play the guitar.
Now we're on top again.

Senior: Do you have a lion . . .

Girl A (bursting into room in-
terrupting): Hey, Kids! llcy, Kids!
Listen, Kids! Kids! I gotta tell
you something! Kids! Kids! Kids!

Girl X: l’uhlcase, Girl A! (Tan't
you see We're talking'.'

Girl A: lint I gotta tell you
this, Kids! it's an absolute. riot!
Some fink actually asked me for a
date on campus!

Girl X (breathily): Seriously
'.’ ‘f '3 (General laughter: Girl A
exits).

Senior: 'l‘hat's funny, l'v- never
seen that girl before and yet she
winked :it me all the time she was
talking.

Girl .\' tsuavely ignoring this):
Well, it there are no more ques-
tions, your parents are waiting
and l've got to go up to the house
and dust off a few favors. The
'57 model holds more.
