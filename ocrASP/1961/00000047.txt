Unopposecl;

Outlines SA Platform

My platform for S.A. President
includes these major areas: trans-
portation, student-faculty relations,
and communications.

I wislt to continue working for
the purchase of a bus which would
eliminate rental cost. increase ed-
ucational trips and trips for catn-
pus organizations and also pro-
vide economical access to tlte col-
lege campus.

As ait integral part of college life,
student-faculty relations is a major
area of my platform. I would con
tinue the Student Faculty (‘ommis-
sion and encourage their work. As
another part of this relationship.
I would continue the leadership or
Summit Conference involving all
major areas of Student government
and the administration.

Communications is a most im-
portant facet of an efficient gov-
ernment and school. I would en-
courage the radio station pro-
gram Another way of improving
communications, I feel is to have
a greater representation and use
of people interested in student
gov rnment. In this way I foresee
an i'icrease in government pres-
tige and increasing chances for
more communication between the
student body anti student govern-
ment. Last, but not least, I would
like to create a general govern-
ment office.

General Aims

The preceding have been my a])(‘-
cific aims but more generally, I
would like to see improvement in
the following areas. recreate cab-
‘inet power of advisorship to the
president amt Seitate, betterment of
communications between Myskania
anti the student body, bring the
Vice-president of SA. to a more
active position as a coordinator of
non-standingI Senate committees,
and bring about an early consider-
ation of budget.

As yoti have read my platform,
you have seen the areas in which
I feel student government could
be better. After a coi‘sideration of
these issues which I hope will bette-
fit all of us here at State. I ask for
your vote.
