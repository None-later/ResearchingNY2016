STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FEBRUARY IO. ‘96!

 

Dr. Vincent Schaefer Heads New Language
Expedition to Yellowstone To Enter State;

A scientific expedition to Yellow-
stone Park, consisting of eight sci-
entists interested in experimental
meteorology will be led by Dr.
Vincent J. Schaefer of tiie Science
Department at SUCEA.

The atmospheric scientists will
assemble at Idaho Falls, February
13, and the next day will travel by
auto to West Yellowstone, then by
snowmobile to the Old Faithful
Geyser Basin. They will spend the
following ten days in the geyser
area studying the unique subcooled
fogs and clouds abounding in the
area.

With each hourly eruption of Old
Faithful, it is possible to make a
new study or experiment, or to re-
peat one already conducted. More
than 200 separate opportunities, to
study and observe at Old Faithful
geyser and other geysers in the
vicinity, will be available during
the ten day period. Nature

Participants of the Expedition

The participants of the expedi-
tion have been selected for their
outstanding abilities in field re-
search. Each will specialize in his
particular phase of the atmos-
pheric sciences. All studies to be
conducted are related to experi-
mental meteorology concerned
with the physical properties of sub-
cooled clouds and ice crystals and
their reactions in the cold air of
the area. The visit will combine
both field research and informal
discussions related to the experi-
mental work underway and the
general scientific interests of each
participant.

Dr. Vincent J. Schaefer. who will
lead the group, is a research con-
sultant in Schenectady and a fee-
turer in science at the College. Dr.
Schaefer, while a Research Asso-
ciate at the (1. li. Research I.ab«
oratory working in the laboratory
of the late Dr. Irving Langmuir,
discovered a method for seeding
subcooled clouds with dry fee, This
led to the large worldwide effort
now being directed toward de-
termining the possibilities and
limitations of weather control. Dr.
Schacfcr spent an exploratory visit
of a week in Yellowstone last win-
ter. lie is responsible for the gen-
eral arrangements and plans to

N oExaminations

Some students have asked me if
I would teach them Sanskrit. I
shall be very glad to give some les—
sons in Sanskrit provided there is
sufficient number. Sanskrit is basic
to many of the Indian languages
and a knowledge of Sanskrit would
help those who want to learn some
Indian language later. I must, how-
ever, caution the enthusiasts that
it is a difficult language—like Latin
or Greek. Only those who are seri-
ous about it should attempt it. This
is not a formal course. So there
will be no examinations, no cred-
its, and no grades. There are no
fees charged and no obligations of
any kind. The group will meet once
a week—either in the afternoons or
evenings—at a time convenient to
all. The text book to be used will
be Perry‘s Sanskrit Primer (Co-
lumbia University Press). It will
not be required for the first 8 or
10 weeks. Those interested will
please furniin the following infor-
mation on a 1fo card:

Jean Anouifh‘s delightful charade with music, “Ring
Around the Moon,“ will be presented by the Dramatics and
Arts Council, for eight performances beginning tonight at
8:30 pm. and continuing through February 25th. A stu-
dent tax card or $1.50 promises an evening of sheer enjoy-
ment in witnessing the results of a Frenchman‘s all-too—
complicated scheme to disengage his twin brother from his
fiancee. The inevitable mix-up of which twin is which
forms the crux of the action. Set in France during the early

1900‘s this two-act

DickRobinson Inauguration Activities
Looks Back To Highlight Weekend

And Ahead

Often, it is highly unfortunate
that we, as members of a race of
humans, must finish a task before
we can really appreciate the scope
of what the job entailed in the first
place. Since one must learn by ex
periencc it seems, at least in thc~
ory, that perfection may never be
attained in any large scale endeavt
or. Applying the above to the job
that I shall finish tomorrow, I
would like to express a few opin-
ions, neither biascd nor those with
which all of you readers will ag-
ree, but simply what I feel I have
learned while being the President
of the Student Association.

DICK ROBINSON

The second annual Inaugural weekend begins today and
will be highlighted by the Inauguration ceremonies, Inaugural

Ball and a jazz concert.

Tomorrow, at 1 pin. in Page Hall, the Inaugural cere-
monies are scheduled. After a short introduction by SA Presi-
dent Richard Robinson, the results of the class elections will
be announced and the officers of the .Iunior, Sophomore and
freshmen classes will be presented.

At that time, the new SA

President and Vice-President

will be introduced. Robinson will then present the new Senate

60- 6i Senate

Finishes Term

Senate began the 1966-61 legis-
lative year with only six members
returning from the previous ses
sion. The pressure of govcrniiient-
a1 demands soon turned this green
group into a serious-iiiinded and
relatively efficient body.

The major part of Senate’s lilllt'
during the spring semester was
devoted to the establisheincnt of
a sound budget for the year. The
combined efforts of Cabinet and
Senate committees greatly expe-
dited the handling of the organi
zations budgets. The budgetary
innovations were begun by Senate.
I‘Iquipiiiciit pool was formed to
handle more efficiently the put"
chase of recreation supplies for
AMIA, \I'AA, and Outing Club
Also. a special contingency fund
was established as part of the
budget to cover unforeseen ex-

members.

After the oath of office has been
administered to the new SA Pres»
ideiit and the gavel has been turn-
ed over to him, Robinson will
officially terminate his office with
his farewell address.

The new president will then as-
sume his first responsibility of
office by administering the oath
of office to the new \'ice~President
and Senators. lie will then deliver
his Inaugural Address.

The official ceremonies will be
concluded by the tapping of )lys-
kaiiia

The newly elected campus gov-
erniiicn' officers will be honored
at the Inaugural Bail tomorrow
