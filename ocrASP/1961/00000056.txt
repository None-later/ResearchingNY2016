Disadvautages of this system are

students with an average below a
2.0 will [tot he allowed to student-

will no longer be easily recognized.

It may interest some students to
know that State college originally
had an S and [l grading system for
student-teaching. However, in 1940,
the ABCDI‘I basis was established
in our college.

Dean llanford also stated that
the possibility of including a trans-
cript of previous college grades
in the placement folder is present—

of the recommendations of the
Middle-States Committees. Actual—

employer has not been in contact

has been a detailed report. on the
student’s performance in student:

to be placed in the folder with the
