There's Groucho anti Chico and
ilarpo and Karl; now thcr's' Rob-
ert E.—Robcrt E. Marx: painter,
teacher, and printniuker (not
necessarily in order of preference).
born Northheini, Germany, 1925,
exhibited in thirtl floor Draper for
the past few weeks (for those of
you who are inflicted by acropho-
bio.)

This week. the rays and praise
of the Prism focus upon the colv
lt-ctioii of canvasses displayed in
our spacious “art gallery.“

Perhaps it is not fair to judge
the work of Mr. Marx by just these
few representative compositions
this best are now at his exhibit
in New York City), but to this un~
trained eye. the paintings appear
to be quite “(‘owleysillilsonisli.”
Definite vertical and horizontal
lines. loriiiless form, and the soft
blending of adjacent colors ptit
Marx's pieces in the same school
as the atort-titentionctl artists. t()r

of this colon—perhaps a certain
sadness or depression. perhaps a
feeling of coolness—or maybe he
just couldn't afford to buy any
more paint. At any rate, the muted
oceans. the endless skies, and the
iiiany-shadowed snow drifts depict-
ed by Mr. Marx seem to reflect
some sort of mood. Whether the
viewer intends to interpret the
scenes as calm. or as sombre, or
as depressing. however. is left en-
tirely tip to his own individual ini-
pressions.

The vast expanse of landscape
anti scenery seems to be the main
theme of the pictures on exhibition.
The fact that Mr. Marx‘s father
was a landscapist is probably the
reason for the artists preoccupa»
tioii with the immensity of nature‘s
domain.

Favorable mention should also
be made of Mr, Marx's prints and
charcoal drawings which exhibit
light lines aiitl delicate detail, not
unlike Japanese prints.

The Art Department of State
\iiUlliti certainly be thanked and
congratulated for making the works
of coiiteiiiporai'y artists so easily
available to the student body—even
if they do lend to favor artists who
display the same tendencies
they.
