It seems a little late to mull over the Maryland State
Game but there has been so little said about it that now
might be the time to give you some of my impressions of
the game.

  
  

Team Elects New Captains
ln Crow, Woytowich

By BOB DAVIES

Clem Crow, State’s only undefeated wrestler, has brought
back another championship to State College. This time, Clem
has captured the l30-pound championship in the 4-I Wrestling
Tourney, held at Case Institute in Cleveland, Ohio. This will
be Clem’s second championship this year, including the State
University Championship.

Clem wrestled against and defeated three conference
champs on his way to the top; two of them were undefeated
until they ran into Clem.

Clem started the series with Fred Scott of Miami of Ohio.
Scott is the current Mid-American champion. Clem rolled
over him easily, winning by a 7-2 decision.

In the quarter-finals, AI Bevilacque fell to the Fed
grappler. Bevilacque is enrolled at New York University and
is the Eastern conference champ. The Violet grappler’s record
stood at 9-0 during the regular season. Clem downed Bevelac-
que, 5-2.

Lanny Kovlik of Waynesburg College was next on tit-
list of calves to be slaughtered as Clem easily decisioned
him 4-l.

In his final match of the set, Clem proved conclusively
that he was a champion by decisioning Bill Kehrig of Lycom-
ing College, 4-2. Clem wrestled a fine match, winning the

Patdcks

When I first saw the Maryland team come on the court
my reaction was of pure sympathy for the Sauersmen. Here
was a team that at first glance appeared to have taken a
wrong bus and landed in Jersey City instead of Madison
Square Garden. Their center was 6’ 8” tall and he was only
one inch taller than their two forwards and two inches taller
than two of their substitutes. As they warmed up I set amazed
as one after the other proceed to throw the ball down
through the hoop taking care not to bang their wrists, fore-
arms or even elbows on the rim. These giants were not the
stereotype_that one sees in the cartoons trying desperately
to.walk wrthout tripping over themselves, ather they were
agile, competent athletes demonstrating the finesse so neces-
sary for such a competitive sport.

Pictured above are the 10 then selected by vote of all participr
in the intramural league as the best in AMIA basketball. The \ll‘s‘ti

Dave Janick—AI’A, Jerry Blair—AIM, Bob Sands—KB, (tart
SLS.

As the game got under way I watched Maryland iump 
to a 7-0 lead and it became evident that Sauers was using
the only strategy possible, slow possession ball. Albany could
never have run the ball for two very good reasons. One, we
did not have the ball handlers necessary to maneuver the
ball well in a fast break style, and the second is that a running
game was the way that Maryland loved to play.

The only offenstre answer
Albany was slow. deliberate bas-
ketball, running the pattern again
