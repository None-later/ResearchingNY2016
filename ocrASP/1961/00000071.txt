Dear Editor,

Colleges and Universities" there are sixty members of the
Educatipn Department at State. Surely some must be capable
of iudging whether a teacher is superior, good, average or
unsatisfactory.

to the Editor:

 

 

‘_ in connection with last week's
fe article, or rather series of ctiuivo-
Jaw'ﬁﬂw of cations, concerning the Penn State

 

Debate trip. i believe that several
additions and footnotes are necesA
sary. and it is for this purpose
that l have ,iotted down the follow-
ing comments.

have listened to many pros and cons from students, legislators
and people in the street. The general consensus seems to
have been opposed to the bill. Students at other State schools
have held rallies in protest —— rather than taking the more
effective measure of petitioning the legislature. During a
rally in Geneseo, the President of the college, Dr. Monech
made the pointed comment: “This is fine for Geneseo but
they can’t see you in Albany.” I

1 would agree that it is sensible
that next year‘s officers be elected
from the corps of capable speak-
ers who won speaker awards. The
"little teachers colleges," however,
did jetl together to get a duncc into
office, as was so aptly phrased by
last Week‘s author. This particular
dtince happened to be the only win-
ner of the speaker award from the
"big university" of Navy! This
post, by the way, was the same one
\\ltlt'll last week's author sought.
Not only did she not win a speak-
er‘s award, but she might be re-
minded that when given the chance
to speak, her in'er-abiiinlance of
emotion and lack of accuracy un-
wittingly destroyed a well taken
_ case that had been previoiislv es-
tablished by her minority .

We have this to say now, to the Governor ' -
Iature, and to the Board of Trustees: If we could’aff’oiidetulifigl:
we would probably be in another school. If tuition is charged,
wtth whr o are you going to populate the new campus? Surel I
not us. If the bill to give State Grants to private school stu-
dents is passed, should we consider ourselves discriminated
against? Also: Why did the protests of both taxpayers and
students go unheeded? Or does this legislature no lon er
derive its authority from these people? Finally: Tax a grs

Each Semester at State 75‘? more
omen learn to park cars than
3% our male population. Mr. (tib«

)urse, says since 1111?, mg people
ave been enrolled in the Driver
.ducation Program. and have re
eived their licenses. Of these 6112,
42 were men and 4513 were women.

Why this impressive ntimber of

{irls at State want transportation
0 R.P.I.‘.’ Are women the only

But this data should not discour-
age fellows. for of the 255 students
in HE. 121. 21151 are men. This is
the driver education instructor's
course. Consequently men are still

tion that the amount of tuition be

stated that in making its determin-
ation, the special fees now charged
students should be reviewed and
revised so that the total paid by
students for tuition and other fees
be fair and reasonable. Although
