Exhibits Paintings of Nature To Revise Old '65 Frosh Handbook Staf

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, MARCH 24, 1961

By ARLEEN EMERY

Mr. Robert Mars, the artist Cave #2” are less vague, more ob-
whose paintings are currently on VIOUSly concerned With Shapes and

exhibit in the Draper gallery, is
a highly sophisticated painter. He
has a clearly developed and indi-
vidual style and he handles his var-
iotts media with extensive techni-

cal skill.
Subject: Nature

lle chooses Nature as his subject,
probably because of his extended
association with the earth during
his boyhood His father was a
landscapist and Marx spent many

hours in the woods and fields of the
estates which his father worked on.

llis resultant familiarity with Na-

ture is obvious in his work, but he
is not merely a representative
painter of landscapes. in fact, he

with depicting the land. as he is
with communicating its effect tipon
man.
“Man Within Nature"

A persistent motif in his work is
"man within nature." llis vague,
almost unrecognizable human fig-
ures are an integral part of the
places around them. Some paint-
ings are totally devoid of human
life; but they transmit an impres-
sionistic image of the earth. "Win-
ter Landscape :2,“ for example,
is empty and lonely, a human bc‘
ing's emotional expression of his
response to the universe.

Narrow Range of Colors

Mr. Mars usually limits his pal-
ette to a narrow range of colors,
giving each painting a single pre—
dominant hue. The cool blues are
good for expressing his frequently
felt loneliness in nature. (“Winter
Landscape" and “Edge of the Sea"
are almost entirely blues and
whites). but he sometimes uses
enough of one of the more vivid
lines to create a dynamic effect.
"The f‘avc 3L." for example. has
a great deal of energy in it, intro-
duced by Marx‘s use of red.

Some of the canvases display a
clearer integrity of forms than
others; "The f)l)sct‘\'et‘s" and “The

form than the landscapes. Yet
these paintings are no less success
ful in transmitting the artist’s re-
sponse to the world of man and
nature.
Prints and Cliarcoals

There are several prints and
charcoal sketches included in the
exhibit. The prints display a strong
design quality and are quite unlike
the paintings in mood. The char-
coals are rather delicate, and one
in particular "Shadow images" is
a beautifully finished drawing.

Noted Moscow Newsman
To Address State Audience

Back in the closing days of the Roaring Twenties the New

York Times carried a page one

report of the firing of a young

undergraduate from the editorship of the University of Minne-

sota’s Daily “for smoking a

cigarette in the University's

library.” Twenty years later, the young editor had become
the Moscow correspondent for this famous New York news-

paper.

This incident did not end his
journalistic career. 'l'hat same year
he covered the tailvcnd of the gang
wars of' thc l’l‘ollllilllmi l‘lra for the
United Press in t‘liicago. ()no of his
outstanding stories was the. incomc
