Voice Views

On Weekend

A true perspective can only be
llt'llll'\(‘(l l))' reviewing llle com-
lllt'lllS of all concerned with tile
\t‘l'l'lx’l'llll, We interviewed a few of
tile counselors.

\i'illialn Mcl'arllly 'liii . . . I
thought llle weekend was very well
lil‘Lllllllu'll. an excellent group of
Mosh. An indication of how great
llle outing was is revealed by the
l‘acl that everyone was tired.

Andy ("lllulsky 'liil , it served
its purpose but was rather regi-
lnenled. The food was excellent
and llle Beanie Ceremony was inl-
pl‘essil'e.

8 ll c l l y Kcllerlnan '62 . . l The
Jan. ('oncerl and ()ulinl; made the
weekend more informal and allow-
ed llle l-‘rosll to get to know one
another. 1 particularly like the
.\(‘ll\lll('.\ presenlalion. The spirit
(1' llle counselors was not up to par
and l lllink lnany polentially good
counselors were liH'l‘llJlel'li in llle
selection. The presence of t'l'aler-
nlll' llrolllers adorned with pins at
llle dance was in poor laslc.
