Where Your Money Goes émumcaam
Many students, most of them without any investiga—
tion of reasons, have been complaining about the
increase in student tax. This year the student govern-
ment portion was raised $1.50 and the Athletic Board‘s por—
tion was raised $7.00 to make a total student tax of $41.50.
Athletic Board, which is appointed by Senate, is com—
posed of three non-Varsity male students, one female stu—
dent, three faculty members, and is advised by Coach Mer-
lin Hathaway. The budget they drew up last spring includ—
ed three main new projects: using the Armory for basket-
ball games, providing a baseball diamond on the college’s
playing field, and obtaining a subsidy for players who must \Valerlnn‘y flail, although .\lr.

To All Fraternity Men:

tine of the many purposes of
State‘s inter-Fratcrnity Council is
“to establish anti enforce uniform
regulations for rushing."
