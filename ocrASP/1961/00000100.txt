Engineers Propose Possible
Camp Dippikill Appearance

In past years the problem of
Camp Dippikill has been a promi-
nent one here at State. It has been
the topic of student discussions in
and out of school, particularly
with members of Student Associa-
tion, the student governing body.
As many students know, Dippikill
was one of the main points in the
President of Student Association
election platforms during ’60 and
'61 elections.

Although the Camp Dippikill
problem has not been completely
settled, definite plans for student
facilities have been proposed.
These proposals are more complete
and definite than any plans which
have been previously drawn up
and presented to the student body.

During last year several groups
organized trips to Dippikill in order
to secure material which would
aid any concrete plans. This past
summer the Camp proposal was
developed even further when engi.
neers were engaged. They survey-
ed the campsite at a cost of $690

llouser, Dr. Long.
Gibson, and Mr. Merlin Hathaway.

and produced a topographical map
showing location of the lake shore-
line, and surrouding plant growth.

The surveyors proposed that
larger trees remain standing for
purposes of conservation and over-
all appearance of the entire camp-
site.

Tiius, plans have been and are
being aimed at making Dippikill
more beautiful for student use.
Aims are such that the facilities
will be as favorable as possible
in such a camp.

One of the drawbacks of many
State students in taking advan-
tagc of our camp has been the
feature of lack of facilities and
organization. However, it tcnta-
tive plans become reality, Dippi-
kill will have much more to offer
titan it has already. Appearance
of the camp will certainly be a fea-
ture which will benefit it, and make
trips there even more enjoyable
than they are at present time.

Certainly, Dippikill will prove an
asset for student activities.
