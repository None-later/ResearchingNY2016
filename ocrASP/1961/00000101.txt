APA Rolls Up Two Wins;
EEP, SLS Each Take One

APA Gets By SLS in Defensive Battle

Aided by a solid defense, APA was able to defeat a tena-
cious SLS squad, 6-0. A 60 yard touchdown pass-play frotn
Ron Crowell to Chuck Hunter in the first quarter turned out
to be the only counter in the contest and provided APA with

its margin of victory.

The initial quarter produced a flurry of good defensive

backfield play, as SLS intercepted a “Rocky Crowell pass.
only to have Mike Goldstein of APA return the favor. Within
a matter of minutes the winners had their first score of the
contest as Chuck Hunter snared a toss and outran the defend-
ers to the goal line. SLS then put on an offensive drive which
threatened to tie the score, as quarterback. George Anastas.
fired twice to Jon Starks for gains of 45 and 20 yards. but
the drive fell short as the APA defense tightened.

The game see-sawed until SLS again threatened to score
late in the third quarter as Anastas hit speedy Faye Richard-
son on a 40 yard pass-play, but again the TD attempt was
thwarted. At the final whistle the score still stood 6-0. with
APA the victors.

Potter Club Downs Waterbury Hall

Monday, Potter put together a fast-moving offense which
rolled over the forces from Waterbury Hall 38-7. While
Waterbury’s defensive line. led by Gary Jones and hard-hitting
freshman Stan Krivo. put an excellent rush on quarterback
Camarrata. Men’s defensive backfield could not cope with
Potter’s intricate pass patterns and Mike constantlv found re-
ceivers in the clear. ”

EEI’ drew first blood (luring the
first quarter as ('huch Recesso
grabbed a (‘amarratta pass for a
TD. The Potter men kept rolling
in the second quarter as I’at Spic-
ci grabbed two passes for a pair
of 'I‘D’s. one covering a distance
of 65 yards.
