We would like to compliment

“One juice, one juice, one juice
” these are truly the Words
heard throughout Alden-Waterbury
(lining hall at mealtime. The
quantity of the food is meager;
for ('\.’tlil])l('. one very small slice
of roast pork was served to us on
October i).

The quality is usually good;
however. the salsbury steak did
taste like hamburger cooked in
(ixydol: the Sunday steak was de-
licious: yet. it was the size of an
expectant shoestring.

Let its examine the cost of one
of the meals served in the A—W
dining hall: two hot dogs at 15c
at most lunch stands, one scoop
of beans at 5c (maximum), left
over salads, pic at about 15c, one
juice at 5c.
