On Politics:
Can We Teach

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 20, 196]

What We Know

By JOSEPH GALU

Recently high school teachers
have been charged with being pro-
Communist, soft on Communism, or
pinko for the frank teaching of both
American and world history.

It is the view of several extrem-
ist groups that if one teaches the
electoral college was provided to
keep the common rabble from
electing the president that this is
an attempt to undermine someone’s
faith in America.

The same view is held by these
groups with relation to teaching
that both our Revolution and the
Russian Revolution were caused by
dissatisfaction with economic con-
ditions.

It has probably been guessed by
most that the extremist groups are
those who are extreme to the right.
Included are the American Legion,
the DAR (Daughters of the Amer-
ican Revolution), and the .lolin
Birch Society.

These organizations forget iliat
the Russian Revolution was not a
Red leatl revolt. They also forget
that the conditions which cause vir~

tually all change are economic.
They fail to remember that many
of our founding fathers had very
little faith in the common man.
These founding fathers provided for
the indirect election of Senators.

It appears to me that these
groups believe in concealing the
truth rather than admitting (1)
there are similarities between our
revolution against a king and the
Russian revolt against a czar and
(2) there were people who feared
the democracy most of us cherish.

These groups, which are largely
political in nature, have attempted
to censor both our teachers and
our history texts. There can be no
excuse for this. If we cannot stand
on oitr record, then our record is
not a worthy one. i believe it is a
good one.

We have made mistakes and we
should not be proud of them, but
it would be an .her mistake to try
to hide them bebiiid lies or a hid-
tlen censor's red pencil. (Isn't it
strange that We even equate the
evil pencil of a censor with the
color red.)

deeply introspective, 'l‘hcrt seems

Nickel Misery
Evidence of this development is
found in “The Nickel Misery of
G e o r g 0 Washington Carver
Brown.“ by Ivan (ioltl. 'l‘his fast-
paced story is interspersed with
enough sympathetic humor to al-
low the reader to catch his breath.
Mr. Gold delves into the mysteri-
ous world of an Army Basic Train-
ing Center and the miseries which

a patheric southern Negro farm ,

boy, George Washington Carver
Brown, undergoes.

Brown, the butt of the entire
company‘s frustrations, would be a
hilarious low-comedy character if
the episodes he becomes involved
in were not culminated in the final
horror which the author so skill-
itilly suggests throughout but llt'\'~

er states outright. until the boy is
suddenly and shockingly killed.

This is a story about the raci-

problem. but it is unlike the usual

Review Class
Rivalry Views

By FIVE FRESIIMEN

Now that the days of Rivalry are
slowly drawing to a close, we
thought it might prove inspiring to
gather a few varied opinions con-
cerning Rivalry.

When asked, ‘What is your im-
pression of Rivalry and its effect,
in general'.’," a freshman. a Soph-
omore, a Junior, a lllyskania mem-
ber of the faculty had these com-
ments:

Janie Fagan '(SS—“Rivalry is a
good way to get to know your fel-
low clLissiiitites. The spirit of friend—
ly competition throughout it forms
a good atmosphere in which to
start your years at State."

('arot \‘l'amcdling 'til~“’l‘lie pur-
pose of Rivalry is good but it
should be about half as long. ly
mid October, thc novelty has \vorn
off and the spirit is lost: everyone
s c c in s more conccrnctl with
studies,"

ltichartl .lonnettc 'tSZl-J'Rivalry is
good in that you meet many new
people. all kinds? l've seen many
era/y goingsoii during this time.
Some Soplioiiioi‘cs seem tti carry
it too far, though."

Sully .loncs ‘62-‘41 lit'll(‘\'(‘ that
Rivalry has been highly successful.
the class of ‘tifi has developed a
real feeling of class unity. The
class of ‘tll has made the whole
period a iiietiiiingful one by being
'l‘illtlll' \vitli warnings."
