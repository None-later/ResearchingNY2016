In Homecoming Game

Rack 4th Conference Win;

Gerstenberger Scores 4,-
Team to Face Oswego Sat.

This past Saturday, neither driving rain nor chilling
cold could (taunt the varsity soccer standard bearers. This
weather and the freshman game earlier in the day made
the field slippet‘_' and sloppy. However, we were seemingly
iiiibotliered by it as we rolled to a 7—0 victory over Platts—
lltlt'g. State had complete control from beginning to end.

(lur >t‘tll‘illg punch was performing like a well oiled
machine. Erwin Seimon scored two quick goals givingus
a 2-0 lead and iipiiig his season total to 11. Karl Heinz
Gerstenberger and Phil Shaw. a newcomer to the scoring
column. each scored a goal handing our colorbeai‘ers a
it) lead at. the end of the quarter. Gerstenberger scored
the only goal of" the second quarter giving us the half time
lead of 5—H,

()til' defense. led by Gary Pcnfield as goalie. contained
l’latt;.burg's scoring punch and held them scoreless
throughout the game. This is the second unscored game
in a row.

In the second half, the Peds continued to roll in high
gt .tl‘ (lerstenbergci' connected for two more goals in the
third quarter. making the score 7-0 at the end of the third
quarter. His fourth goal tied Erwin Scimon for the season
record. The State all-time record is also four goals for one
game. Shaw added another goal in the fourth quarter
giving us the game victory. 8-0. This was our filth Victory
oi the season and our fourth in the conference.

Despite the lousy weather. there were several staunch
supporters. These checrers illustrated the true spirit of
State College. In the future, as long as the weather per-
mits. supporters should be more numerous. However,
(‘oaeli Garcia was glad that there were at least some sup—
porters for this Homecoming game.

(.‘oaeli Garcia had several comments about tomororw‘s
away game with (.iswcgo. “Oswego will be one of the
toigliest games this season. This game. is their,H0m_e-
coniing gami and as always the team Will be ‘up for it.
The riyalry between this school and theirs has always been
at l‘\' keen: The loser of this game has to provide a we—
eei'lmll with the date and the score of the game. Plans
are being laid to liaye an annual trophy l'or the winner.
they are skilled and very efficient. However, our team has
been playing like a team. They don't have any in-
diiidualists, l have waited fora team like this for 11 years
and I think that they will be able to go far."
