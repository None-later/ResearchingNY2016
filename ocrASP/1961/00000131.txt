The Sound of Music

One of State‘s finest traditions will be manifested this
Sunday evening in Page Hall, as all of the dormitories,
sororities, and fraternities participate in the Holiday Sing.
Books, terms papers, and test preparation will be forgot-
ten for one night as State College offers its contribution
to this season of warmth and joy. The Christmas trees
have been decorated; the eight days of Chanukah have
passed; and downtown Albany literally glows at night with
the numerous street trimmings.

There will be many groups participating in this sing
for a trophy which will be awarded to the best chorus.
Remember this one thing—as you sing and listen, all of
"ou are contributing to the oneness of feeling that Will be
‘he spirit of the evening. Happy Holiday! AWS

Trial by Ordeal

The final examination period is prolonged agony for
.JOth good and poor students. The mighty are brought
low; the proud are chastened; the plodders slow to a crawl;
the careless feel painful remorse. Haunted eyes and trem-
bling hands are everywhere.

By this time you probably realize that the ordeal of
final examinations will be shorter than in previous years.
Examinations will be two hours long instead of three.
Although this system of administering “finals” may be
more efficient, we do not feel that it is an improvement.

A two-hour examination covering the work of a whole
semester demands as much preparation as a three-hour
test. However, the scope of the examination itself is
limited by time. Would it be an adequate measure of
achievement? Because it cannot be as comprehensive as
a three-hour examination, chance has a large part in
determining the quality of a student's test. In a way,
chance contributes a great deal in determining final
grades, and in a two—hour test the odds are against the
studrnt.

The examination schedule must be made up without
regard to the program and problems of the individual.
If someone has tests in his major and minor on the first
day of the examination period, he must accept it stoically.
Now there is a possibility that one may have three examin—
ations in one day. Even if we do not consider the amount
of “reviewing” which must be done for them, the intellec-
tual and emotion strain of taking all of these tests is
appalling. How well can the student use his knowledge
on the third test'.’ It‘s rather hard to accept this stoically.
In many courses mid-semester tests are the only measures
of achievement besides “finals”. Final examinations are
very important. The scheduling of three two-hour cxamin~
ations is leaving too much to l'l‘lallt“ and not enough to
the ability of the individual.

We realize that nothing could possibly be done about
altering the present examination scheduli. However, we
sincerely hope that. this problem will be investigated after
the examination Jii‘l'ltitl. and if it is found that this [)l't)"l'till'l
is unsatisfactory. that a tllllt'l't'lll schedule will be Litiillii'l-
istercd in June. Surely it i; also difficult tor the protest
sors who must correct and grade reams of examination
booklets.
