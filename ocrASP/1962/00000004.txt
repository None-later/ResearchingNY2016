By JOE GALU

The city of Newburgh has been
in the news for almost a year. Be
fore considering the situation of
relief. I would like to survey part
of \ewburgh's history.

D it ring the nineteen-twenties
.\‘ewburgli was the shopping center
for the area around it. During the
depression it became even more a
center due to the fact that public
transport connected it with its out-
skirts

Immediately after the war many
shopping centers were built. They
were built in areas near the city
such as Middleton. Westchester
and North Rockland. With the art
rival of a car in every carport and
breezeway. Newburghers began
shopping outside the city. The peo-
ple who once rode buses into New-
biirgli now drive their cars to the
nearest bargain paradise

The people who live in .\"ewburgh
have t'iught a long. bloody and
successful battle against any and
all industries trying to enter the
city of .\"ewburgh and the town of
\‘ewbiirgh. International Business
Machine attempted to build a plant
in the outskirts of Newburgh. The
plant is located in I’oiighkeepsie
\‘ewburgh has seen no new indus-
try of any size since 1929.

The city's business was upper
class It lost this trade as soon as
the rationing of gasoline was stop-
pcd. .\Iany major businesses have
closed due to lack of high class
business and the inability of the
lower classes to carry the number
of businesses in the city. The popu-
lation of .\"ewbtirgh has not grown
much between 19% and moo, The
meaning of this is that with upper

class people buying outside of
Newburgh there is less business in
the city

The majority of people now liv-
ing in the slums of .\"ewburgh are
.\‘egroes and Ptierto Ricans. The
area where these people live has
been a slum for some time.

The main slum area is around
Water Street Most of the small
stores in the area were opened by
people who l;\cd in 'he bacl.
of the store or aboye the store.
\‘ow the owners no longer live
above the stores The apartments
have been rented to \cgroes The
older groups no lunar shop in this

Iii everyone's home town. there
is the type of boy who is constd-
cred "perfect for the friend yoti

bung home for semester break.
'. h.s type of bay is "a good
safe date." and he's not the

type who is so terribly slow he
doesn't know whether he's afoot or
horseback but on the other hand.
yin want to he sure he won't at-
tempt to engulf your poor friend
with his all too avid attention.
It may sound strange. btit this
"safe" type is pretty hard to find

wespecially during semester va-
cation.

Two weeks before we went
home. I wrote letters trying to

prepare everyone for the task of
locating a date for one of State's

love to go out with you. Charlie.
but . . do you have any nice
friends 1’ '.’ '.’ "

When I arrived home, all friends
and friends of friends were quite
unavailable. and we were faced
with the problem of finding some-
one—anyone. Out came the old
high school yearbook, and it's
shocking to behold what inconven-
iences the Army and marriage
have caused.

Parents are no help at all in
a situation like this. "You find her
a nice date or else . . . 

. What?"

they whisper. “Or else .
. or else you stay home!"
Then the friend starts. “That's

t).K. I’ll stay home. I can watch
TV with your parents. I'm just
dowdy and plain . . . . and no one
wants me. That's OK . . "
At this point. I began considering

eligible relatives t“ even

Finally. at six on Saturday night

we found one. He was a "safe"

OK. I'll go."

In fact he even asked otit
"friciid" again-wv—wahout being
told to do it? So you see. Stale
girls are more than bovine milk»
maids.———even though they cause
their "dowdy and plain" girl-
friends to watch TV with their

part-ins while they trapsc tiff to
see "The Kitchen" with the "per-
fect" date.
