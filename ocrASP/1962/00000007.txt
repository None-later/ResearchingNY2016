Moving Up Day A Success

STAT E

,1

Moving Up Day once again becomes the object of evalua-
tion. We would like to compliment those who contributed to
the success of the Day. The class speakers were amusing and
interesting, Dave Brooker, a cordial M.C., and Mr. Thorsten-
sen, guest speaker, enlightening when he ably reiterated the
concept of “Tradition.” His helpful hints concerning what
is tradition and how it can be maintained, are points upon
which to ponder. He reminded us that the essence of Tradi-
tion can be lost when attention is centered upon creating
tradition rather than recognizing one as it evolves.

Perhaps greater concentration upon the more important
aspects of the day, Such as the announcement of awards and
the moving up of classes, would not only reduce the length
of the occasion, but also increase its dignity. We feel that the
’moving up’ of the classes is no longer as significant as it'
once was. Freshmen ’move down' from their seats in the bal-
cony without really knowing why, and since they do this only
once a year, it doesn’t matter.

The return of the skit was received with enthusiasm. Bill
Schmidt and Ross Dunn did a superb iob with llFollow Me,“
and Walt Peters again exhibited his fine musical talent.

Vote The Issues

We went to a Senate meeting this past Tuesday, as many
people already know, and although we were very actively
involved in much of Senate’s discussion that night, there was
still the natural instinct of the newspaperman to make obser-
vations above and beyond our own part in the meeting; and
by and large, we liked what we saw.

True, several Senators mentioned afterwards that this
meeting was the most interesting in recent weeks, but like
any legislative body, meetings and discussions are bound to
drag ordinarily. The important thing is that we were lucky
enough to observe a meeting where interest ran high. We
were interested to note that the bugaboo of past Senates—
no attempt to discuss the real issue—was almost totally absent.
We were also interested to note that Senate, at least at this
meeting, was a dynamic, outspoken Senate. The meeting was
not dominated by only a few; rather, the Senate seemed to
be acting as a whole, as the governmental organization it is.
Granted, there were factions—but are they not a part of

Democracy?

Above we mentioned that the meeting was ALMOST de-
void of not attempting to argue the real issue—but not com-
pletely. Therefore, we proffer this bit of advice for all Student
Senators, for all time: be sure that YOU and YOUR colleagues,
of either faction, are debating AND voting upon the true issue
at hand. If you are doing this, then we doubt if you can go

wrong.

We almost hate to add this last, because it shall sound
like a justification of this editorial, but add 'it we must. Very
likely we shall be accused of trying to “butter-up” Senate by
writing this editorial. Such is not the case. This week, Senate
came very near to reaching the essence of what a Senate
should be. If the passing of the NEWS budget would destroy
what was accomplished this week, then we would rather see
it defeated. But more than anything else, we should like to be
assured that the issues, AND ONLY THE ISSUES, would be

discussed. We would then feel confident on all counts.
W.A.F.

The Bear Baiter

Ity lIAENLIN & FEIGEL

We propose this social documen-
tary as an addition to next year’s
Frosh Handbook. It is a brief sunt-
tnary of the dating habits of the
five predominant grottps on camp-
us.

Our first subject doesn’t know too
many people at State since he just
transferred frotn O.C.C.C. So lie
takes out a girl he knew tltere. Be-
ing a veteran, lte enjoys (tovern-
ntent subsidized alcoholism, eti-
phcntistically knowit as the (Li.

duction to see the sets he's design-
ed, and rounds of the evening with
a trip to ()’lleaney"s.

Our next ittait begins by check-
ing the house dating file for an ap-
propriate aitd his (iillette handbook
for conversation topics. After prac-
tice he comes home to change. Af
ter his shower he quickly performs
two dynamic tension exercises lll
front of ltis full-length mirror. ’l‘heit

lte liberally applies his thlll'l‘
ttl’ARD deodorant and athlete's
foot powder. Five minutes later

he's fully dressed in sweat socks,
low cut sneakers, rhinos and a let
tci‘ sweater. He then sprints the

7 Hamilton and StudentsMeet

To Discuss Tuition for State

Dr. Hamilton, President of the
State University of New York, met
recently with Dave Brooker and
Steve Condojani, SUCEA President
and Vice-President and represent:-
atives of ten other state teachers
colleges. Tuition for state colleges
and the scholarship incentive pro-
gram were discussed.

Many Favor Tuition

Dr. Hamilton presented the op-
inions of people who favor tuition
for state-supported colleges. They
feel that the increased cost of a
college education involving main-
tenance, equipment aitd faculty
cannot be paid by taxation alone.
Teaching benefits the individual
and therefore the state and the stu-
dent should share the cost of his
education. The life—time income of
college graduates is $200,000 more
than non—college graduates.

We tlten must face the question
often asked. “Why, then. should
State 'l'eachers Colleges be treated
differently'.” The reasons under
lying this question are many. A
student at Nassau pays a $300 tui~
tioit aitd a Farmingdalc student
pays none, yet their chemistry cur-
ricttla are. identical. The last argu-
ment in behalf of tltc tuition is, "If
the tuition will benefit the worthy,
is not, then, the tuition worthy'."‘

Mr. Murray. Secretary to the
Board of Trustees, was also pres-
ent at the meeting. He believes
that "teaching is no longer as unr
derpaid as some are led to be-
lieve.” He suggested that a good
position is seldotn guaranteed after
twelve years. According to the new
salary scale, the minimum start-
iitg salary is $4,200 which is a
"good paying position."

Hamilton’s ﬁrms on Collection

of Tuition

A representative from Oswego
posed the question, “how will the
tiiitiott be apportioned?” Dr. Ham-
iltott replied, "I cannot answer this
because I don't know, but I do feel
that inoitey collected at Albany
should remain iit Albany." Dr.
llamtlton was also asked if tuition
cltargcd at state colleges would af-
t'est tltc cost of state support. Ile
answered that lie doesn’t think so,
but legislation will ltave the final
say.

Tuition Deittaitded at State
(Tolleges

Action on the bill is a definite
possibility for various reasons. It
is known that higher education has.
tor a long time, formed some set
ttiitioit pattern. For instance, SUNY

L G. BALFOUII

Fraternity Jewelry
Badges, Steins, Rings
Jewelry, Gifts, Favors
Stationery, Programs

Club Pins, Kevs

 

 

 

colleges such as l'larpur, Long Is-
land, and medical schools have
charged a tuition rate from $100 to
$400 since 1948. This is because
these colleges did not form until
after the 1948 SUNY consolidation.
Also, the cost of higher education
has been greatly lessened by the
community colleges where the stu-
dents bear one-third of the cost.
the community one-third, and the
state one-third.

Scholarship Incentive Program

Dr. llantilton and the students
also considered possible implica-
tions of the scholarship incentive
program. The program provides
for a $100, $200, or $300 stipend per
year dependent on the student's
fainin income. An applicant can
receive $100 if his family's income
is $7,500 or more. A payment of
$300 is offered to those whose fant-
ilies earn $3,500 or less. When ask-
ed wltetltcr this was gross or net
inconte, Dr. Hamilton answered
that is is itot clear as yet. If the
school which the student attends
charges tuition of $200 or more, lie
is eligible for the program. Fees
may be incorporated into present
fees and charges, Dr. llaittilton be-
lieves that this is not fair because
the administration of the respective
state colleges would lose their local
ilt'NllllIll)’ itt their determination of
fees since payment would ltave to
be handled by the State University.

Retroactive Tuition?

An important question to the
present students at state colleges
is whether tuition will be retro-
active Some educators feel that
"since students came expecting no
tttttton. ll would be unfair. There-
fore the entering class should be
required to pay it." Others oppose
this policy saying  than has had
a free ride-—why not stop it now?”
Another Chance to Present Views

The studctns will itth be the peo-
ple who decide ttiition policy. Af-
ter a policy is formulated by the
Board of Trustees it is Dr Ilamil-
ton's feeling that the Board will
meet with the students again and
give thcnt ait opportunity to pre—
sent their views.

Dr. llamilton closed the meeting
with this statement: “We, (myself
aitd the lSoard of Trustees) will do
our tiptttost to make the impact of
a tuition on the student a minimum
one, therefore reaping maximum
possible benefits."
