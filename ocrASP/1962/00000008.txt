Brockport Belted For Two;
Peds Travel Northwards

By JIM DOUGHERTY

This weekend the Fed diamond squad will be testing its
fortunes in the most northern reaches of New York State.
The Feds left early this morning for a single game with Pots-
dam this afternoon to be followed by a twin-bill on the home
field of the Plattsburgh Cardinals tomorrow.

State will be looking to register its seventh consecutive
victory today, and with a little luck, they could come home
with their win skein lengthened to nine. Chuck Recesso (l-l),
Pete Spina (3-D and Danny D’Angelico (2-0) will be starting
on the mound in this three-game excursion.

The biggest handicap of the season will plague the Feds
this afternoon as the bats of Gary Penfield and Mike Camarata
will be noticeably absent from the line-up. Due to academic
restrictions, these two starters cannot make the trip until
tomorrow. Coach Burlingame is also hoping that Jim Brown’s
leg will be strong enough to endure the punshment of twenty-

three innings of play.

BROCKPORT TRAVELS WINLESS
Saturday afternoon the Golden Eagles of Brockport State
arrived in Albany with a shining 1-] season record. After
facing the Peel squad for fourteen innings, the Eagles headed
back to the Genesee with a bit tarnished l-3 log.

The Eagles managed only one
hit. a two-out single in the fifth
inning. in the first game as Pete
Spina struck out eight on the way
to his first shut-out of the season.
The Feds didn't do too much bet-
ter. but managed one run on two
hits to emerge the victors.

In the second game it looked
bad for Danny D'Angelico as the
Brockport team came up with two
big runs in the top of the first.
The Feds wanted the dual victory,
however, and came back with four
runs in the bottom of the same iii-
ning. This was the final score (4-2)
as both teams settled down to some
serious baseball.

 

Tennis

The Fresh tennis team hit the
road this week with a match
against Cobleskill. The Feds lost
this match 6-3.
john Barthelmes and John Stur-
tcvant won all three points for
Albany. Both won their singles and
teamed up for a doubles win. Bar-
thelmes beat Tom Connors in three
sets 6—3. 5-7. 6-0. Sturtevant beat
Lou Barber 6-2, 6-2. As a team
they beat (‘onnor and Smith 6-3.
6-1.

way to the top.

After the first round of play. the

There is a three-way tie for sec‘

First Track Meet He/d
Varsity Push Begins Soon

By R. DAVIES

Ben Franklin once said: “Great oaks from little acorns
gr0w.“ This phrase may be rewritten to apply to State as
"Great teams from little beginnings grow.” State’s new track
team had a small beginning indeed. The first attempt to start
a team fizzled out in 1956. The spark of interest was kept alive
by enthusiastic individuals who carried the idea along until
it was picked up by another. That spark again burst into flame
last Saturday. About thirty men assembled to participate in
State’s first track meet in four years; the second in its history.

The meet was opened with the running of the IOO-yard
dash. Dave Janick captured first place, finishing in I0.05
seconds. Dave Moore and Bill Carmello finished second and
third respectively, running l0.lS and 10.3.

The 220-yard dash was entered by only three men, but
this event still provided thrills and a spill. The winning time
was 24.4 seconds, run by Charlie Hunter of APA. Don Noble
finished second followed by Lynn Costello who lacked a half-
step to tie.

Pete McDonald captured first place in the 440 and half-
mile. Pete finished 54.85 for the 440 and 2:159 for the half.
Pete has been practicing almost daily at Bleeker and this
showed up in his performances. Lagging behind for three
fourths of the half-mile, Pete began to SPRINT around the
stretch, winning by four-tenths of a second.

Placing in the 440 were Charlie Hunter, 55.5, and Steve
Doleski, 57.0. Phil Shaw finished 2:l6.3 in the half, followed
by Dan Twomey, 2:l9.55.

Joe Powhicla dominated the shot-put and the discus,
taking a first place in both events. Joe threw the l2-pound shot
48’ 5“, better than ten feet beyond his nearest opponent. John

7—“—Lilga came in second with a throw
of 33851;". and lid liiichalter third
with 36'.

l'owhida threw the college dis-
cos 112'-1ti" to take another first
place. He was again followed by
l.iiga who threw a fine toss of 100‘-
ft" llarold l’opp threw (ST-8' i" for
third place.

ii. the broad jump. Dave Janick
tinished first with a jump of 18’-
Itl‘n”. lie was followed by team-
mates Ii'rcd Curtis and Dick Moore
who jumped 18587;" and 18'-8‘i".

Sherwin Bowen and Paul Slusar
tought a hard battle for the high—
until) award but Bowen jumped

St" to win over Slusar's 558".

As a finale. the 4-10 relay was
run, won by team-It. Dave .iaiiick.
ltoy Knapp. t‘huck Hunter and
Dick Moore.
