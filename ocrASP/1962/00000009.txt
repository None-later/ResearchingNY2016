Senate Battles Over Budget;

Third Readings

Tuesday evening. while the
Weather outside changed from a
hot, muggy atmosphere to a thun-
dering downpour, the atmosphere
inside changed accordingly.

Preliminary Bouts

The budget for the Student Union
Board was taken off the table from
last week. After a few minutes of
discussion, the SUB budget was
passed.

The Camp Board and Typewrit-
er Pool budgets wore next on the
agenda. (.‘amp Board received 812,-
500 which will be used for (‘amp
Dippikill.

Semi-Final

Senate next went through a leng-
thy discussion over the State Col-
lege News budget. Four years ago.
the student government of this col~
lege realized recognized that as
the college grows. many of the SO-
called extra - curricular positions
were soon to expand into almost
full time jobs. The precedent was
set when Senate voted Stilt) yearly
salary to the SA l’rcsiilcnt. Tues-
day. the State College News pre-
sented its case in establishing the
fact that the editorship of the pub»
licatioii has also expanded into
"job" status.

Intermission

The next order of business in-
volved the Primer, Press Bureau.
and College. llamlbook. All three
of these budgets were passed.

.Vlain Event

The discussion of the budget of
the Pcdogoguc was similar to the
discussion of the State College
News budgets. During the prelim-
inary hearing, the amount paid to
the photographer was deleted. Af-
ter debate, Senate raised the photo-
grapher's fee to what it has been
in past years.

The yearbook editor then made a
request for a $200 salary. Senate
lost track of the issues and pi‘ccc-
dent setting act they made when
passing the News budget by imme»
diately turning around, forgetting
what had been said. and voting
fnis similar $2oo salary line to the
editorship of the Pedagogue on no

Coming Attractions

The rules of Senate state that
all bills must have a third reading
before they can finally be passed.

"An excellent college function
which should be kept permanent-
ly"; “Best party and picnic ever”!
“Wonderful fun for everyone who
went"! — The above quotes rep-
resent only a few of the comments
expressing overwhelming satisfac-
tion with last week's IFC—ISC
Weekend. The general opinion of
the weekend spells Success with a
capital S. Spirit and Spirit.

Spirits were high and flowing at
last Friday evcning's well-attended
beer party at .\chnown‘s (,lrovc.
.loe ()ppedisano and his Manhat-
tans provided lively dance mustc
for the crowd to rock to, and the
Fort Lauderdale craze reached Al-
bany when a vigorous "limbo"
contest took the center of attrac-
tion. Table walkers and thumper
games added to the joy of the oc-
casion and a crazy but contcsi
captured a great deal of attention.

The person with enough fore-
sight to bring a broom to thc
party is unknown, but those who
passed under the broom compile a
long list.

llarvy Kaufman sported a novel
creation which bore resemblance
to a smorgasbord complete with
tree branches, cigarette packs and
state bread, while l’ctc Fisher had
a bird perched atop his head.

Sunday's picnic was not dis-
missed as a failure despite the in
climate weather. Those who went
to the Thatcher l’ark outing repor‘e
ed that  good time was had by
all," and weather was the only
reason for the low attendance.
The general consensus indicated
that another weekend of this sort
would be welcome next year.

D&A to Present Tragedy;
’Oedipus Rex' Starts Tonight

Steindorff,

In an attempt to give this Greek
tragedy a meaning and signific-
ance to today's audience and to re-
move it from an academic experi-
ence, Dramatics and Art Council
is adding modern variations to its
production of “Oedipus Rex.”

Translated by William Butler
Yeats, the play will be presented
in Page llall today and tomorrow
at 8:30 pm.

Projections are being used to
replace the chorus with a single
narrator's voice. The setting, in-
stead of the traditional palace fa-
cade, will be modernized to sug-
gest not a specific locale but an
area for action.

costumes will have a classical
lltnoi‘ but are not intended to be
literal reproductions. Characters,
rather than wearing masks, will
hati- lltl'll‘ faces painted to symbol-
ize iiiiislts.

Dedication

Dr Paul truce l’ettit, director,
announces that the production will
bc dedicated to Edward (lordon
('i‘aig, "probably the greatest liv»
iiig theatre philosopher."

The design of the setting is an
attempt to practice certain of his

News Celebrates 45th Year
Looks Back to”Ear/ier Days

l“()l't_\“fi\’t’ years ago on October
4, 1916, the first issue of the State
College News was published by a
group of 13 enterprising young
students.

This first issue proclaimed that
the 1916 freshman class of 330 stu-
dents was the “largest in the his-
tory of the college." “A remark-
able featurc and one that comes as
a good omen is the presence of
over on men," stated the editors,
and they further added that "the
proportion of men has now reach~
ed the 5:1 mark.”

Slate College's answer to the
Beanie Ball was reported 5 years
later on October 1-1. 1920 when
“the class of '23 entertained the
class of '24 at a ‘get wise meet-
ing‘. Each frosh was met in the
ball by a,Sophomore who blinded
him and led him to his doom."
After the ceremonies, "the music
started and everyone danced. Sher-
bet and wafers were served and
after dancing until 11, everyone
wont home feeling that they had
really had a good time."

"Student Tax to Jump to $14 if
Budget is Passed” stated the News
headline on October 4, 1929, and
in October, 1936 it was revealed

"Suylcs Denies New Dormitory
Secretly Planned for Women” an-
nounced September 20, 1940‘s issue.
"Any idea of putting women in
proposed men's dormitory is en
tircly false and should be treated
as such," stated the Dean.

April 2o. 1915, the News re-
ported “an evening of bridge and

the Joint cooperation of State‘s 8

he school increases in size the
need for communication increases.
Even now, the newspaper is the
primary source of communication
from organization to organization
and from the administration to the
student body.
Importance of S.A.

“Make the News a newspaper,
not a bulletin board," Frankonis
points out. The student body has
to learn to think of the News as a
newspaper; until that time the
\‘ews will “slog along as it has
tended to in previous years."

He pointed out this change in
approach to the News cannot hap«
pen through the efforts of the small
group in the News office, if only
for the reason that the paper is
dependent on the student body for
the majority of material used.

A Course in Journalism

Frankonis reiterated the need for
a journalism course in the college
curriculum, “not only for those
members of News Board but for
all students who are going into
teaching." Even with News Board
experience, adequate tutelage of a
high school group is not possible
without formal preparation.

Independence

The best thing for the State Col-
legs News “would be for it to go
