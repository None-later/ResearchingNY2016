To The Graduates

Since this is the last edition of the NEWS this year we
should like to say a few words to this year’s Seniors who will
be graduating in June. Four years of grinding effort should
not go unrecognized in these pages.

By receiving a degree, you are accomplishing something
which people pretty much take for granted these days. But
you know the work that went into getting that degree; you
know it was not easy—so you have all the right in the world to
feel proud. However, always keep in mind that the world in
general has seen fit to minimize the importance of the Bache-
lor’s Degree; therefore, you shall be iudged, not by your
degree, but by your personal abilities. You must be willing to
assert yourselves — for if you do not, no one else is going to,
and you will find yourselves left by the wayside.

Another thought that is probably in many minds is the
question of whether or not you must teach. in this matter you
must search your own minds and hearts and finally decide if
teaching is the profession you wish to pursue. If you feel that
you do not really want to teach, then you must not feel that
simply because you have spent four years in a Teacher’s Col-
lege you are obligated to teach. You felt the desire to gain an
education, and perhaps, that was the only way you could do
so. Then do not feel guilty or ashamed if you do not accept a
teaching position. The profession is probably better off with-
out someone who is not wholeheartedly interested in it. The
important thing is that you have gained an education—and
your only obligation is that you give to society the benefit of
your education to the best of your abilities. How you do it is
up to you. You must be honest to yourselves.

Finally, then, we offer you our congratulations for your
accomplishment — you deserve the congratulations of every-
one connected with the college. As some immediate measure
of return, be grateful to the people of New York who have
paid for most of your education. And if you feel they have
not done so, iust look at the costs at private colleges. Good
luck in your coming careers, whatever they are. We are con-
fident you will do well—your education is more than sufficent.

For 45 Years

On this, the forty-fifth anniversary of the NEWS, we
should like to take time to say a few words about the paper—
past, present and future.

First, we should like to thank and congratulate all the
past Editors and staffs of the NEWS for having brought the
paper from an 8xll, four-page newspaper to its presentlsize
and scope. Their achievements are ours, iust as our achieve-
ments belong even to past members of the NEWS. Besides
Myskania, we are probably the only non-fraternal organization
on campus that has an unbroken line of continuous accom-
plishment. Policies change, but the essence of the paper does
not. Standards even change, but still the essence of the paper
does not.

To the present staff we offer hearty congratulations, for
you have gone farther in improving the NEWS than any
previous staff.

To future Editors and staff members, we can only say
that there are forty-five years of achievement behind you.
You must continue to progress; you must continue to leave
all—AND WE MEAN ALL—other organizations far behind in
improving your — our organization.

To next semester’s new editor we wish you luck—and
forty-five years of experience to draw upon.

eommnt'cdiowt

 

Dear Editor:

I must express my disappoint-
ment about a remark published in
last week‘s Common-Stater about
professors. It is possible that I
have no sense of humor, but since
I’ve never been accused of such a
lack, I have to assume that the
remark simply was not funny, and
in fact, that is was made in ex-
tremely bad taste.

The only reason that I bother to
write this letter is because I feel
that the State College News staff
has done a great deal to raise the
standards of the paper during the
past year, and have included some-
thing worth while and creditable
in each edition. They have raised
it from the level of a gossip col-
umn. ta job which was no mean
task). and have included in it a
variety of informative and import-
ant articles. But the inclusion of
such remarks as last week’s
(which was only one of many sim-
ilar comments published in the pa-
per) can completely erase the
value of everything constructive
done by the staff, at least in tcrms
of establishing a reputation.

It is not possible for your writers
to make their humor gruesome and
their criticisms non-constructive
than they usually do’.’ I think the
exercising of a bit more thought
on the part of the News staff is
called for when there is a question
of ridiculing some member of the
college to absolutely no avail.

Yours truly,
Arleen Emery

 

Dear Editor:

To the individual who questioned
the propriety of the subject matter
of the Bear Batter in last week’s
Common-Stator, I ask, “What sub-
ject would he suggest?" I agree
that current news events would be
more in line with the collegiate
world awareness attitude, but
would the student body really be
interested in a satire O‘l nuclear
warfare? Also, he must agree that
the more important matters, like
the main cafeteria, social incidents
during the week, the administra-
tion, and Albany’s sewer system
usually have been adequately cow
cred by the rest of the paper.

’Gold Thread’, ’The Riddle’, End A. D.

Presentations; Excellent Contrast

By ELAINE ROMATOWSKI

There was no doubt in the mind
of any menibcr of the audience
viewing the AD. productions Tues-
day night that thesc were among
the finest presented this year,

The two plays on the bill con-
trasted sliarply~thc first, “an or-
iginal verso play by Herbert Smith
Howard, "was profound, philoso-
phical. didactic; the second, "a
children's one act play," floatcd
by on a cloud of fantasy.

()rdinarily. a review of such prc-
sciitatioiis could be concerned with
the acting and the technical as—
pccts of the production rather than
the script itself, In a play such as
the "(told 'l‘lircad." howcvcr. the
script is the production.

Aftci' sccing tlic "(told 'l‘hrcad,"
onc wishcs he had had the oppoi‘~
tiiiiily to road it before and could
havc the opportunity to rcad it
again. He feels that there were

     

many thougilt-provoking lines that
t'Iiiwi-d by too quickly to be fully
appreciated.

The “(told Thread" is poetry; it
is a mood. Making it into a dram-
atic production was a task few
could have accomplished as well as
did the director, Bob Steinliaucr.
The lighting effects uscd provided
the nccdcd dramatic touches to
what otherwise would have been
oiin an intellectual poetry recita-
tion. while the "othcr-worldlincss"
of thc cliaractci‘s' movements and
cxprcssions both intensified the
mood and placed the emphasis
where it belonged—on tlic linc
rather than on any sort of action.

The second presentation of tlic
cvcning. "'I‘hc Riddle.” by .I. ('on-
boy. was a delightful fairy-talc
ably dircctcd by l’ati‘icia liciicdct»
to. Althouin the play was writtcn
with a child's imagination and
sense of humor in iniml. thc simplc
"beautiful 7 princcss. handsomc ~

hero" plot delighted the adult au-
dience as much as it did the chil-
dren for whom it was performed
last Sunday.

The children. however, most
likely did not notice the forgotten
llllt‘S or the accidental bumps into
furniture, or the not-over-played-
enough character of the prince.
Rather, they were probably fascin-
ated by the faiicifullycolored cos-
tumes, the comedy of the impossi-
blc situation, and the humor that
spilled from the exaggerated fa-
cial cxprcssioiis and actions so ncc~
cssary to amuse and hold the at-
tention of the child-like mind.

'I‘ h a n k s and congratulations
should be extended to all veteran
and aspiring actors and actresses
who contribuch their time and cf-
t'orts to the various I\.D. produc-
tions this ycar. I'prcricncc is the
l)t'>l tcachcr.
