(Ed. Note: This article is based

Times-Union.)

The automobile and advertising
sign are shaping our architecture
and environment far beyond what
their proper influence should allow.
It is shocking to realize that this
condition will grow worse before
adequate means can emerge to
stem the deterioration of our visual
surroundings. Considering that ar-
chitecture is the one art form that
We cannot possibly avoid, it is in-
deed strange that it receives so
little criticism or evidence of pub-
lic concern. One reason for this ap-
parent apathy is that the newspa-
pers will not print specific critic-
ism of private or commercial ar-
chitecture. Freedom of the press
exists in areas which do not chal-
lenge advertising. their ideas.
methods or products. It is an ironic
truth of our democracy that we
can be openly critical of only that
which belongs to the State.

architecture would make a better
looking world; now it appears that
some practices in and about mod-
ern architecture are far worse
than any we have ever had. Des
signed economy of space and ma-
terials is producing some of the
most unpleasant living patterns
that one can imagine. ’l‘owns like
ltcnsselaerville and Altamont still
hint at what our architecture
might be. Although these towns are
essentially products of the 19th
century, they do have a command-
ing sense of unity and order that
is sorely missed in most other
areas. Even these villages are be-
ginnig to succumb to the daudy
and cheap devices that clutter our
roadways and menace whatever
pleasures the eyes might have
found formerly.

Iligh speed modern transporta—
tion has dealt a crippling blow to
the cause of architecture. The au-
tomobile has literally destroyed
the form of the house as well as
much of the land. We have never
planned intelligently for the de-
sign and use of automobiles and

most likely we never shall. This is
not to say we don’t care for them;
they receive attention, space and
affection far beyond what they do-
servc. Many small homes of today
are almost fifty percent garage or
facilities which relate to the gar-
age. Automobiles do not have to
be brought in at night, they can
survive outdoor conditions and
should be designed to do so. The
house that holds the most appeal
for me is one which does not have
a road ending in it, one which re-
lates to nature and has the poise
and dignity a good dwelling should
possess.

()ur highways are aflame with
the coarsest, most demanding kind
of messages, imaginable. 'l‘hey
filcker, they spin, they bubble, and,
in addition, they are probably di-
rectly responsible for a high per-
centage of accidents. The small
and modest colonial sign left peo-
ple free to enjoy both architecture
and nature calmly. A few places
manage to hold out, but too few to
contrast or compete effectively

with the aggressive mass. In Alta-
mont. llelcn Becker‘s shoe repair
and candy store does not have a
single sign to indicate its function.
This is an extreme example but
I always feel a little better in paus-
ing to admire this absence of the
usual frantic commercial compul-
sion.

()n top of all the visual chaos
caused by the vicious spread of
signs one can rightly object to the
repetition of the message they
shout. As a sort of perverse game
I have even counted the number
of times certain motels, which ob-
viously are motels, proclaim that
they are. It would be a fine gesture
if business places could say what
they are just once and trust the
intelligence of the observer to re-
member and recognize the fact.

l'ness there can be a general re-
vival of sensitivity I fear we shall
soon eschange the beauty of our
land and buildings for the ques-
tioiiablc merits of convenience of
transportation and expedient-e of
advertising.

Focus
On Faculty

By LINDA P. WIII’I‘E

“The students have changed;
they are worldly-wise and know
more about what’s going on than
we did. They are sensitive to
problems we were not aware of."

Dean Clifton 'l‘horne graduated
from Albany State in 1949, and

speaks from experience. When Dr.
Thornc entered State as a fresh-
man in 1941, the school had 1999
women and 39 men enrolled. The
present ratio could be worse!
Sayles and Pierce (for Women)
were the only residence halls. At
that time there were no philosophy,
psychology, or comparative litera—
ture departments. Dr. 'l‘horne ma-
jored in business and had to trudge
up to the third floor of Draper to
his classes. If he wanted to use
the business machines he often had
to share the room with a typing
class. He. confesses, "as far as
students are concerned, I Wouldn't
be a person to say ‘Let's go back
to the good old days'.”
Served in Navy

Dean 'l‘horne left college alter
his first semester to join the Navy.
While in military service he “\‘is-
itcd" (.‘hina, Japan, Alaska. .‘\lc\-
ico and the Pacific Islands. Sliang»
hai deeply impressed him. “It‘s
like a subway in New York (‘ity
21 hours a day." Because it was
so overcrowded many of the poor
lived on boats. He saw a great deal
of poverty crowded up against
small oases of wealth.

Japan was a much cleaner coun
try, and the people didn't seem so
poor. ’l‘hey appeared more intelli
gent and "less aimless."

Dean ’I‘hornc can't really tell us
too much about our forty-ninth
state. He was stationed in 1111'
Aleutians in bleak inidwvinter. llc
"saw a lot of seals.”

Received Master’s from State

After his military service Dean
’I‘horne returned to State College
In 1951 he received a Master’s in
Administration. In 1957 he no»
awarded a Doctorate of Education
from Columbia University.

Teaching (‘areer

Dr. ’l'horne taught high school
business subjects at lted llook
(‘cntral School. In 1952 he cami-
back to Albany State  a business
teacher. He continued teaching in
the business department until Jan
uary of last year when he becamc
the Director of Graduate Studies,
replacing I)r. Flinton who was
working on a special project. Last
summer Dean ’l‘horne was the In
rector of Summer Sessions.

Other Professional Activities

l)r. 'l'liorne had the distinction
of being the first college prot'cssoi
in the state to present an cdiiczi
lional course on the college 1(‘\i'i
