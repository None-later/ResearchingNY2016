By
BARBARA HALL

The Commission on English of
the College Entrance Examination
Board has proposed a Training In-
stitute iii August to work otit with
Go competent teachers, in groups
of 20, plans for a series of insti-
tutes iii the summer of 1962. The
estimated cost is 3555.000. State is
to be one of the 2’.) colleges attd
universities iii the tiatioti to meet
this summer.

CASDA. as the association is
called. is directed by Dr. Donald
'1‘. Donley. (.‘ttrrently‘. his depart-

through which research information

Research Dissemination Project

The (‘ASiM-l'SOIC Research Dis-
semination Project has not bad all
the phases of the process complete-
ly established yet. However. the
project inodei is functional to a
high degree at the present time and

(Continued from Page (3)

Perhaps many of the students
take T.V. for granted here at State
and have not realized the many
problems, people and planning that
goes into making the classes they
observed an effective learning situ-
ation. The observation situation is
carefully planned, controlled, and
clearly related to the materials of
either a course in the Psychologi—
cal fi‘ouiidations of Education or a
course in special methods.

After five years there are some
general reactions to the program
which can be summed up as fol-
lows: technical difficulties still are
a problem but most are now iron-
ed out. There is an unreality about
the sitttation because of the flat,
black and white image. Circulat-
ing small groups of observers
tiirotigii the demonstrating class-
room helps to counteract this
somewhat negative reaction. Some
viewers complain that the demon-
strations are too carefully planned
and executed. that they are
“rigged.”

They maintain tha no real high
scltool class moves this smoothly
with sttch mature subject matter.
Oit the other hand seine viewers
find fault with the demonstations
on the grounds that it looks so
easy. After student teaching on
T.V. they confess to their fellow
students that this sort of thing is
not as easy as it looks. Finally,
all viewers unconsciously judge
closed circuit T.V. against com-
mercial T.V. Demonstration CCTV
tends to suffer in this contrast.

On the positive side. admitting
that there. is nothing better than
the live situation. CCTV does cn-
able us to handle large numbers
of people iii an observation situa—
wiiicli is carefully planned.

As Dr. Cocltranc has said, "the
CCTV may not be as significant
an invention as the wheel, but it
is at least ttsefui to us as the type—
writer."

Oedipus Contributor, Joe,
A Barber, Talks of Music

“Most people visualize their barber reading the race form

in his spare time .

. I compose music in between hair-cuts,”

relates Joe Gallitelli, the barber-composer, who has just com-
pleted the overture and incidental music for the new produc-
tion of “Oedipus Rex,” by Sophocles, translated by William
Butler Yeats, to be presented by the D & A Council May 19
and 20 in the State College Theater in Page Hall. Dr. Petit,
director, and one of Mr. Gallitelli’s best customers, requested
that he do the score. Mr. Gallitelli decided to employ the in-
frequently used twelve-tone scale for the score, rather than

the traditional eight-tone scale,

 

because he feels that Albany,

 

.loe. Gallitelli—the barber who writes initsic between haircuts.

a tradition-ininded city, should be
orientated to thc ttnusual scale tone
which until the past few years has
been restricted to the New York
City area, where “everything
goes." After reading the script of
“Oedipus Rex," Joe believes that
although it is an “off-beat” verSion
of the original, it still has the ap-
peal with which it has fascmatcd
audiences for thousands of years.

“Joe,” is well-known locally for
tltc many compositions which have
been performed by the Albany City
and ’l‘ri-City Orchestras. The Al-
bany City Orchestra has performed
his "l’relude for Strings,” and
“Nocturne,” and the 'l‘t'i-City Or-
chestra has performed his “Waltz
on Strings," on seven different ocv
casions. in ltitti, Leon Barzin, ttow
residing iii Paris, France, read
one of Joe's compositions for the
National Orchestral Association iii
New York City. Joe has partici~
pated tti many composer forums
attd readings where he says, “an
unknown eaii become known." llis
works have bccti read at the Schen-
ectady .'\litsetttti, t‘olumbta [Titi-
versity atid lsrael. 'l‘his Noveiither

ltoit with l'rofessot' .ioltn t'tit'abella
attd fit his spare time studied
scores for ‘self diseiphttc.’ Joe feels
that sclf'tiisctplinc is the key-note
to a composer’s progress. With the
many areas in music to choose
from, a composer must be selec-
tive of the type he would like to
pursue. A modern composer would

“1 experiment a lot with all types
of music composition, for imagina-
tion is useless without experiment-
ation. But I know my limits. This
is very important for a composer
to remember. A composer should
concentrate upon the type of music
where he is most creative.” “I
compose because I would ‘die in-
side’ if i did not. I love music so
much, that sometimes I hate it."
When asked whether he sang to his
customers, he replied, “I can’t sing
a note. I can’t even carry a tune.”

lie admires the techniques of
the modern composers. “Their
craftsmanship is superb. They tape
sounds, and produce music which
is called composition. 1 like to feel
inspired when i listen to a piece
of' music. Wlten I listen to the
works of modern composers such
as David Diamond, and Gage, I
feel cold inside. They have no
‘sotil"’

Joe has much to say about the
subsidizatioii of orchestras in the
l‘itited States. Although subsidiza-
ttoti of orchestras and operas is
prevalent iti Europe, it is a very
controversial issue iii America.
When he speaks of the topic, he
would like it to be thought that he
is speaking for the others who
have iiiitcli more talctit than be,
atitl who cannot devote their full
tttne and talent to the art because
they must concern themselves with
trying to earn a livelihood. Joe
[ii'o\'itles excellent reasons for his
faith in substilixatton. A composer
may devote his ettttre life to his
work, aiid produce only one which
cottld be called a iiiaster~piece.
For this reason, his production
should not be limited, tltcreby
limiting the chance of his coin-
positig a masterpiece. The only
