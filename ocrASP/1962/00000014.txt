Awards. . .

(Continued from Page 1)
sarily mean that the award-winner
must be the best player on the
team, he might not even be an out-
standing individual performer. The
winner, however, must be a varsity
athlete, and this in itself implies
some degree of skill. Chuck, by his
membership and participation in
two varsity sports, more than ade-
quately filled this requirement.

Attitude

Under the heading of attitude,
the requirements become more dif-
ficult to define. In general, the
standards used under the heading
of attitude, were as follows:

1. Did the player work hard at
all times?-

2. Was the player a leader of his
teammates on the field, on the
bench, in the locker room and all
other times?

3. Was he able to take personal
disappointment without showing
dissatisfaction to his teammates,
the fans, and his coaches?

4. Was the player more interest-
ed in a team effort than in per—
sonal rewards'.‘

5. Was he a person to whom new
men on the team looked for en-
eoui'ageinent‘.’

It should be mentioned that these
standards set by tiie News Hoard
were general ones Wlilt'll served
basically as a guide. In making the
final choice, the Board discussed
litany aspects of the players (with
sidered.

In the final analysis the plaque
was awarded to the varsity alli-
lete who best portrayed the image
of State (foliege Athletics (.‘huck
lleeesso.

were discovered that need to be
mentioned as they help classify us,
State College students.

College male is 21.75 years. The
mean for the women is surprising-
ly 19.42 which thus brings down
the average age for a state stu-
dent to 20.2.

single, 3% go steady, 18"}; are
pinned, 15"? engaged and the lucky
remaining 15’12 are married.

Men show a different ratio. Only
8"? are married while another 8%
are going steady, 16% are pinned
and the other 62% are free and
still looking.

Beard statistics created a few
facts that 86.6"? of our men are
clean shaven, 7.1% need a shave,
3.9’: had a mustache, .82% a
goatec and then there are those
with a beard. Ninety-eight
point five percent of the men were
belts, black leather leading with
22.3"?»

Regular shirts are not statisti-

cally popular. 67% wear sport
shirts, and 33% wear the regular
type shirt. Tics are worn by 61/4 %.

In the jewelry field, 17% of the
girls and 10% of the boys worc
high‘school rings. 15% and 6%
wore marriage rings, fraternal
rings were 21% and 6% while cos-
tume rings reigned with 21”» and
6%. The State University rings
assumed the lead with 25% for
girls and 36% for the men.
