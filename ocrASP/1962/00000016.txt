To the Frosh

Once more it is the privilege of the News to dedicate an
editorial to several beanied and name-tagged frosh and to
hundreds of unidentifiable devils. We welcome you to State
and wish you luck as students and teachers.

There is no formula for success. Perhaps the only ad-
vice we can offer is another warning to add to your already
numerous load. Don’t depend too much on luck; look be-
fore you leap; don’t let things slide.

With the stated purpose of becoming, to quote a former
News editor, “educated educators," you are studying at one
of the finest colleges in the nation. You’ve heard that you
are the best prepared students to ever enter the college.
This analysis gives you the added responsibility of living
up to the expectations of your fellow students, the faculty,
and the administration.

Although the main facet of your college life should be
academic, you will never be educated unless you also learn
socially. Do be enthusiastic. Sincere enthusiasm is a rare
and a valuable quality. With a little caution and wise judg-
ment, you can learn to budget your time and interests. For
instance, now, before the work load is too heavy, Rivalry
will give you a tremendous opportunity to enjoy the fellow-
ship of others.

Some of you will refuse to face the problems and deci-
sions of college life. Others, those who learn to adapt them-
selves, will gain tremendous satisfaction from their life at
Albany State.

State College is worth the effort.

To All Our Readers

Throughout the summer and especially this week, the
new editor of the News has repeatedly been asked about
subsequent policies and plans of the publication.

Because of its nature and its relationship to the col—
lege community, the State College News has a fairly stable
purpose. This year, as in other years, the “only organized
means of communication on the campus” will strive to of-
fer accurate, unbiased, and, we hope, interesting reports
on all facets of our college.

Since the News is directed and written entirely by stu-
dents and since its main body of readers is the student body,
the News will chiefly emphasize the activities and view-
points of students.

However, students should also be aware of happenings
and circumstances in faculty and administration. For this
second aspect of the over-all purpose, the News attempts
to provide specific information in areas affecting students.

Thirdly, the News must represent State College to peo-
ple outside of the college community. These readers often
judge the worth of the school by the informative material
contained and the student views reflected in the paper.

The News welcomes the criticism of" students, faculty.
and administrators. If you have suggestions, phase tell us
instead of your friends. Then, if you are really dedicated
to these ideas. help us to carry them out: come into the
Publications Office and Work on the newspaper.

Meanwhile remember that your cooperation and en—
coni'agenient are at least as necessary and valuable as your
complaints. ‘

Focus
On Faculty

By LINDA l’. WHITE

“My professional experience
gives me an opportunity to write
music for my students and thus
gives me a closer contact with the
student in developing greater iii-
tcrcst. My reward is satisfaction
in the enthusiasm shown by the
student during performance." Mr.
Anthony Salatino. a new member
of our music department. has had
a wide range of practical experi-
ence in the music world. He ve-
hemently denies the timeworn pro-
verb, “If you can‘t do it, teach
it."

MUSIC ARRANGER

Mr. Salatino has arranged mus
sic for Buddy Morrow and such
hands as the llal McIntyre Band.
He plays a wide variety of musical
instruments, btit he specializes in
clarinet and saxophone. llis Sym-
phony in Jazz had its premier at
Carnegie Hall, and another com-
position of his, Symphont Fantasti-
que, was presented at the Brook—
lyn Academy of Music. For a
time he was an associate conduct—

or of the Riverside Symphony
Orchestra.

T. V. WORK
llavc you heard the Chester-

field March on the ABC television
network? Mr. Salatino aranged
it. He has also scored the Babe
commercial. From symphonies to
Madison Avenue! lie composed the
music for the television show One
World. This past Sunday afternoon
the Barberton Ohio lligh School
Band performed some of his works
over the ABC television network.
Mr. Salatino had a two-week va-
cation in California this summer
wwhile he was scoring music for
a television pilot film.

EARLY INSPIRATIONS

How and why did Mr. Sala-
liiio become interested in inusic'.’
His music teacher in high school
encouraged him to study many
different instruments and to con-
tiiiite his education in music. ller

RECEPTION. E'l‘t‘.

State has received the three R‘s—Religion, Rivalry, and Red Devils.

Sayles has received the feminine touch. This evening after being
received in Brit. the Fresh may receive an initiation to our local
landmarks. (lreeks have received the devils with open arms. We

hope our column is as warmly received.

A JOB WELL DONE

Since there's always a calm before the storm. a word of thanks
is in order here to all those who took part in making a success of
Freshman Weekend and of the '05 Handbook Readers, hold these
words of praise . . . . they will be few and far between.

I.()OONG

This is the password for the fall semester. We see long tables
in an integrated cafeteria lacking their familiar “in—group" colors.
Long lines in the commons show We have a small spark of intellectu-
alism kindling on campusﬂtoo bad there aren’t any books available
with which we can increase the flame.

LIVING IT UP

it seems that one group has been heading for Thacher on Sun«
days. .\laybe they're looking for a place to live. Since we're sure
that an act committed three years ago has been well punished. we
would like to see some action on the part of an apathetic Housing

Receaptionf’rovesLively
But ‘Jazz' Goes Bust

By BILL FRANKONIS

’l‘lic All-College Reception enter-
tainment, is seldom, if ever, re-
viewed, but this year's entertain-
ment was surprisingly better than
it has been in previous years, and
perhaps foreshadows even happier

years ahead on the Page llall
stage.
The combined talents of Anne

Smith and Elly Daiil resulted in a
delightful rendering of guitar'ac-
coinpzinied songs in a style sonic-
what akin to the Kingston Trio.
There was an electric tension about
this duo that transmitted itself to
the audience at the first guitar
chord. it was a tension born of a
flawless knowledge of their ina-
terial. What they did sounded easy
to do. and in the Arts, anything
that appears easy. is usually it
sign of long and paiieiit rehearsal.
The young elllnfonte l.~il singers zit
iill' end of the show might have
done well to emulate \liss Smith
and Miss liahl in the matter of
rehearsal,

'l'lie interlude toolci‘y of Tim At-
wt it. a freshman. who "sang" two
.\lill‘.‘\ originally sung by Tom l.chr
l'tl'. was a til’iltlillilti bit of busi-
llt ~ lle. more than anyone.
served to loosen up the audicnce
and maintain their receptiie mood.

llis sil'ttlL‘ili laced antics gave his
liltiliitlll of an eye and ear for
comedy and this. combined with

an almost perfect sense of timing,
makes him. almost certainly, ti
person to hear more from.

lene Paciunas.

The show-stopper, as he so often
is, was Danny Labeillc. llis mimic
portrayal of a girl preparing her-
self for the day, was a magnificent
one. Although annually repeated.
liabeille's pantomine was as fresh
and sparkling as if it Were being
done for the first time. There was
no doubt about the surroundings or
the articles being used: each was
as real as if they were there——
and this is the secret of the artistry
of a iiiastei'-inind. Though more
slapstick than the mimicry of .\lai‘
cel .\larceau. liabeille was as
subtle as the French master when
he cared to be. and the result was
a hilarioust heartwarming rcndi~
lion of a too~offcit-overlotiked art.
