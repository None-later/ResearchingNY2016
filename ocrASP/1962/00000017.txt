Freshmen Give

Verdant Verdict

Reactions to Frosh Weekend ap-
parently indicate that it was gen-
erally considered a success by the
Class of '65.

When questioned, Marianne liu—
pic, Sara McKee, and Sharon
Marosek all agreed that they would
have enjoyed more time in which
to relax. Sara felt that she really
met more classmates than she
might have without the weekend.
The Torchlight (‘eremony impress-
ed Sharon as her best introduction
to college life.

“I loved it!" bubbled (‘arol Vito
and Pamela (‘hristy agreed.

Thatcher Park especially im-
pressed Maxine I‘Ihrenkonig and
Sue McAleavey. "Fabulous view
and the walk was worth it," de-
clared Sue. Maxine desired some
time for resting between activities.

However, William (,‘olgan was
only struck strongly by 'l‘orchlight
l’rocession and “the Frosh Girls!"

tion in which Nancy ltubin found
herself at the end of the weekend.

James Morrell spent his time in
a trance, dizzy from the arrival
whirl.

Yes, everyone who helped work
on the Weekend can be satisfied
with a project that was considered
well organim-d and successful.

Frosh Lament
Early Clases

By ED WOLNER '65

As the first rays of morning is-
sue forth and fall gently upon Dorm
Field, one. 'an observe the peace
and tranquility that is nature’s
alone in the early hours of the day.
lluman activity has been dormant
for the past six hours and every-
one is pleasantly involved in his
pri 'ate coma of dreams. However,
one intri 'atc little object has been
ticking constantly throughout the
night, the source of misery to
many as its hands precipitate
themselves toward that hour dread

ed by all -7 am.

l'Iver stealthily, the hour hand
creeps over the seven. alid as it
does a general alarm is sent

through the dorms, second only in
catastrophic effects to a boinh.
Alarm clocks janglc, hands reach
out to silence their rude calling,
bloodsliot eyes stare at the ceiling
and everyone wonders why they
must get up at so tliicomfortabie
an hour.

A student gets up, walks to the
window. aiid says, “(lood morning,
Lord!" while the opposite feeling
might be expressed by his room—
ate who, upon observing the seem
ingly glaring sun replies, "(lood
Lord! is it morning?”

Now clothes are hastily donned
and those who have enough ambi»
tion grab some food and masticate
it ill a half waking manner, bit-
terly mumbling about the texture
of the toast.

Breakfast being consumed, books
are gathered and a rush is made
toward the academic campus. Fil-
ing from the dorms, the hundreds
of students join the mass exodus
to beat lime in the race to make
the one class a day that holds the
most antipathy for everyone —~ the

Oh, when those Frosh came marching in .
we. counselors started that Friday with a grin.

The day dawned with a golden sun in a mellow sky . . .
and promised 790 anxiolis Frosh by sundown at 5.

We padded our minds for the onslaught of queries . . .
and sutured our muscles for the weekend wearies.

Willi nametags and handbooks, we sent them off scamping

to learn those 5 songs in one hour, was cramping.

When day turned to night. the l’ieanic (‘ereiiiony was flaming , .

With careful instruction, we lead the assortment
to the nineteen buses for the ’l'halcher transportincnt.

lly two p m. the 7:35 were scoring aml exploring , .
while some of us did some ignoring amt snoring.

'l‘he skits at nine were a humored compulsion
but by then we all needed automation propulsion.

Sunday was the time for fussing .

iiicllided some imissing, discussing and cussing.

The Fashion show was astounding, with new styles noted
while the .‘\('ll\lltt‘.\ agenda was expoundmg and cltibs it promoted.

The holiday meals. all along,

the stomach did appease .

We joined in the foil. our corns were forgotten . . .
there was always Monday to mend them somewhat.

'l‘he ne\t morning was occupied with robust dispossessing , . .

as we set the Frosh free, after

our good natured blessing.

Voice Views

On Weekend

A trite perspective can only be
achieved by reviewing the com-
ments of all concerned with the
weekend We interviewed a few of
the counselors.

William Mct‘arthy ‘63 . . . I

‘ thought the weekend was very well

organized, an excellent group of
Frosh. An indication of how great
the outing was is revealed by the
fact that everyone was tired.

Andy Cibulsky '63 . . It served
its purpose but was rather regi-
mented. The food was excellent
and the Beanie Ceremony was im-
pressive.

Shelly Kellerman '62 . . . The
Jazz Concert and Outing made the
weekend more informal and allow-
ed the Frosh to get to know one
another. I particularly like the
Activities presentation The spirit
of' the counselors was not tip to par
aizd I think many potentially good
counselors were overlooked in the
selection. The presence of frater-
nity brothers adorned with piiis at
the dance was in poor taste,

lluxz \t‘etker ‘s‘z Fantastic,
well organi‘led and most effective
for orientating the Frosh to the
routine of college. i didn't like the
idea of herding the Frosh like
sheep. 'l‘hey should be treated like
college students and not high
school kids.

l’eter Fisher ‘62 , , . if l were a
counselor again, to choose a resi-
dence at Sayles, erd floor.

llowie Woodrtllf ‘tiil . . . 'l‘remen-
dolls!

Marylou lCiscnmen ‘tiit . . . It
was fatiguing and I slept for it days.
it was exciting and stimulating to
see such active freshmen.

Steve (‘onkojam 'tlii . . , :\ frantic
but enjoyable rat race.
