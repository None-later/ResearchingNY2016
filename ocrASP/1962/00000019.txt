most illustrated books by the fideli-

justified in looking to the illustra-
tions to clarify and amplify the
text itself.

Frosh, got a complaint? Here’s

Results cart not always be promis-

amiiied.

Some of the things which have
been looked into are: more library

State, SCAD Rap Milne Policies

In a sudden, and unexpected, report this week, the State Education De-
partment admitted that the admission policies of the Milne School constituted
discrimination “as far as race and socio-economic status are concerned”. Fol-
lowing close on the heels of this report, the State Commission Against Discrimi-
nation (SCAD) charged that the Milne admissions policy violated the state’s
.- . .. .  v . Anti-disrimination Law on two counts. The charges
lodged are the culmination of an investigation begun
last March. At that time, Mrs. Rhunette Bates made
a complaint to SCAD that her daughter, Sharon, had

Discriminatory

The State Education Department
report stated that the Milne stu-
dent body “is in no way represent-
ative of the population of the area
served by the school or even of
those who apply for admission In
net effect, the priu-cdures are dis-
criminatory as far as race and
Stit‘lti economic status are concern-
ed." The report also stated that
no specific evidence had been
found iii the case of Sharon Bates.

The investigation was carried
out by the l'lductition Practices Act
administration because of an agree-
ment lietw’een the State lidueation
Department and St‘.-\D to cooperate
in order to exclude duplication of
cl'foi‘ts. A tlii'cc~yeui‘ period. from
limit to 19131 was the object of the
investigation.

claimed that any attempts to justi~

are "mere exercises in semantics.”

New Policy

Following the release of the
charges by both agencies. Dr.

Thomas ll. Hamilton, President of
the State University. said that he
hoped to be able to announce new
admissions policies for Milne with-
in a week.

According to Dr. Evan R. Collins,
President of SCCE at Albany, a
committee of Milne faculty mem-
bers has been working on develop-
ing a new policy since last Spring,
when the charge was first made.
At present. it has been decided that
the policy of sibling preference
would be eliminated, btit beyond
tlial. no decisions have been
reached.

.\lr. Conway, who stated that
the doors of the Milne School have
been effectively closed to Negroes
because of admission policies. also
remarked: "It can be assumed that
their i.\111nci soltitioii of the prob-
lem will insure equal opportunity,
uniform treatment of all applicants,
and the elimination of discrimin-
atory practices."

Negroes in Milne

in spite of claims that there are
no Negroes in Milne, a Negro ap-
plicant for the eighth grade has
been admitted, and offi‘ ials have
offered to admit Sharon Bates. 'l‘he
latter. however. however. has yet
to make a decision. and is cur-
rently attending another school.

the number of Negro students in
Millie. President ('ollins said, "It
is illegal for me to know the num-

SCAD, liowevcr. contends that an
intention is not necessary to sus-
tain the discoiery of a probable
cause In short, because of pi'et
erencc. it is possible to assume
that some people are being dis
crlniinatcd against.
