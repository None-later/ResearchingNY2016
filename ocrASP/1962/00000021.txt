Stokes Gives
Rushing Rules

Utpiperclassmen sorority mem-
bers and freshmen girls are about
to enter a period which occurs
annually on the State College cam-
pus. This period. better known as
“rushing.” will first be introduced
to the freshman girls on Monday
afternoon.

A cimpulsory meeting for fresh-
men women and September trans-
fers is scheduled for Monday. 3:00
p. m. at Page Hall. The main ob-
jective of this meeting is for the
girls in the class of ‘65 and trans-
fers to be introduced to the rush-
ing rules and “rushing” as it is
at State.

Scheduled Speakers

Presiding at this meeting will
be Dr. Ellen Stokes. Dean of Wo-
men. and the Inter—Sorority Coun-
cil tISCt. Speeches will be deliv-
ered by Dean Stokes: President
of ISC‘. Judith Kaminsky ‘62; and
a chosen “independent” speaker.

Each girl should bring a 5x7 inch
note card. This card will be stamps
ed at Page Hall and will be nec-
essary in the rushing precedures.

Sorority Open Ilouses

On Thursday and Friday. Oct»
ober 5 and 6. open houses will
be held from T to 9 p. m. for all
girls interested in rushing any
sororities on campus. It will be
necessary for each girl to present

her 5“ x 7" note card at the open
houses. I‘Iach girl will be required

to have her card stamped by at
least s'ut out of the eight soro 'ilies
in order to be eligible for rush-
ing. Thus. each girl must attend
at least six out of eight of the sor~
ority houses during these two ev-
enings.

These cards should be turned
in promptly on Monday. October 9.
at the Student Personnel Office.

Rushing Changes

Each sorority may bid a quota
of only 25 girls each year. There-
fore, only 200 of approximately
500 girls in the class of ‘65 will
be able to join a sorority. This
means that this year the fresh-

man girls will do the rushing,
rather than the sororities rush-

ing freshmen.

All freshmen definiter inter‘
ested in "rushing" and joining

a sorority should carefully notice
the above. Also. they should be
aware of the different sororities.
Iierc at State and should “rush”
those in which they are most inter
ested.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1961

7/te gacﬁanged

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institue:
Of interest to State students should
be the news of R. P. L’s new look
for ’61. Eight coeds have joined
the ranks of this year‘s freshman
class. and they will attend classes
with the Rensselaer men. They will
reside in the Rusell Sage dormi-
tories, however.

The University of Kansas: Of the
27 enrolled members in Tau Sig-
ma. modern dance honorary. 5
are males. This constitutes the
largest masculine turnout that the
group has had in years.

Indiana (Pa.) State College:
Freshmen at Indiana State are re-
quired to carry large red balloons
for a day. These are deflated be-
fore each class and inflated again
when leaving class. Frosh are also
obliged to demonstrate their skills
at hop scotch. obtaining signatures
on hollow eggs and carrying gum
for the upperclassmen.

l'nivcrsity of the Seven Seas:
The latest thing in colleges is a
floating campus. The I'niversity of
the Seven Seas. a newly incorpor—
ated. nonprofit school. is signing
up students for a 120 day trip
around the world, The l'niversity
plans to charter the SS Jerusalem
in September. 1062. to sail from
New York. Classes with ftill aca-
damic credit will be given to stu-
dents aboard ship. and tuition for
the semester will range from 
500 to $3.500. If interested. write
University of Seven Seas. Box 71.
Whittier. California.

University of Rochester: Instead
of a traditional class gift. the class
of ‘61 has substituted a worthy
exchange —— a scholarship for an
African student. The seniors voted
to establish a $600 fund to cover
the cost of board. books and sup-
plies for one of the African stu-
dents who will attend the Univer«
sity this fall. They are now trying
to persuade students on other cam-
puses to adopt scholarship pro-
grams in lieu of ordinary class
gifts.

Anonymous Frosh And ?? ?

Spﬁng

Impromptu Concerts

By BILL l" R ANKONIS

For a college that has so few
boosters. aiitl so many scoffers. it
is nothing short of amazing just
how much talent State (‘ollege
manages to attract. This is not. it
seems. the wasteland people would
have it be.

The motivation for these remarks
‘an be found in two very pleasant
evenings this writer spent last
week in the Lower Lounge at lil'th
baclicr. For the very low cost of
strolling from the
modest four rooms known as home.

ti\t't‘ fti Hm:

I was treated to two \erv imoromp-
tit piano t‘ttlltt'I‘lS oie \l'ethicstl:‘y
night. and another S...tti'tl.iy lll'.‘l‘.l.
'l‘lie |i'l‘lol'tttt‘t‘\ fit each lllSltlltt‘t‘
are Sllll unknown to me. althouin
I do kiiow that Saturday night's
pianist IS a it‘l‘t'~-llltlttll named l’aul.

lloth performances were unusual
and unanticipated treats. Wctlncs
(lay night‘s recital consisted strict-
ly of Boocic. in a style which was
undoubtedly the pianist‘s own for
the usual Boogie format was liber-
ally sprinklcd with lltlt'l'littltttttillS
from both the l’opular aiitl l‘lans
ical worlds of llltlSlt‘.

l’aul. Saftirtlay iiiglit':~ freshman.
St‘t'lllS to have been thoroughly
grounded in musical theory-even
though his technique was a trifle
tIltptillSllt‘tl at times. Ilis program.
howe\cr. offered more variety:
from " tumble loogic" to “Rhap-
sody in Blue." anti again. to
’l‘chailaivsky‘s "I-‘irst l’iano (‘on-
certo." Indeed. his rciitlition of
(.‘ersliwin's work had me complete-
ly fooled at first. for tiiitil l dis-
covered it was being played live.
I confess it sounded much like
Leonard Bernstein‘s recording of
the work.

It is rathcr a shame that there
is no organized arrangement for
lllt'St‘ student pianists to perform
for a larger audience than they
had last week. I can oiily make
two suggestions. li'irst. that these
anonymous tilttlllSlS spend a good
deal more time in the Lounge. thus

dent l'nion Board try to learn the
identities of these two pianists (as
I neglected to do). and then urge
them to play at the next SlIB lis-

I am certain that State's array
