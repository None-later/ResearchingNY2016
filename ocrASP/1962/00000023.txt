STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1961

Jolly Junior Views Rallies

By ROY KNAPI’

For the first time since I enter-
ed State College, I do not have
an active part in rivalry. So, to
see how it all looked to an outsid-
er,I decided to take in the Fresh
and Soph rallies the other night.
Around nine o’clock the Froslh took
over dorm field. They rushed out
of the various halls and onto the
field with reckless abandon.

Once on the field, they formed

tremendous circle around their
cheerleaders and then proceeded
to scream their lungs out. They
ran through the same songs as my
class did when we were in rivalry,
but somehow it all seemed so
strange. I guess there is no place
for a jolly Junior in rivalry. Soon
they left and a period of calm
set over the field. I soon discover-
ed that this was the calm before
the storm. Precisely at the
stroke of ten, a piercing screech
broke through the calm. “Let's
go Sophomores," seemed to be
the cry. Then a small but
noisy brass band came out onto
the field followed by a band of
eccstatic students carrying a yel-
low banner. The. Sophs had ar-
rived. They went through the

same rigorous routine as the Frosh
game

did except that the was

changed. This was all fine and
dandy until the water balloons ap-
peared. Well, the moral of the
story is why ruin it all? The spirit
was great but the enthusiasm at
State dies all too soon. It doesn’t
need any water to dampen it.

Albany to Begin Admitting
Liberal Arts Students In Fall

September 29 the Board of Regents approved the State
University’s plan to convert the College of Education at
Albany into a multi-purpose institution. Dr. Thomas Ham-
ilton, President of the University, announces that in the
Fall of 1962 the college will begin enrollment in the liberal
arts and sciences program. Albany State is the first to adopt
this program which will eventually be scheduled for the

eleven state colleges of education. However, the primary
objective of these institutions will continue to be teacher

education.

Mrs. Roosevelt
To Talk Ocl. l9

“How the United States Can Best
Influence the World Against Com-
munism" is the title of the talk to
be given by Mrs Eleanor Roose-
\‘cll on October 19 at 8 pm. in Page
llall. Mrs. Roosevelt, who will be
the guest of the Forum of Politics,
will attend a private dinner in her
honor from 6:30 to 7:30 pm, in
Brubachcr llall.

Ross Dunn, '63 Prcsidcnt of the
Forum of Politics, will introduce
Dr. lﬁvan R. Collins, President of
thc (‘ollcgc, who, in turn, will in-
troduce Mrs. Roosevelt. l’l‘csidcnt
(‘ollins will also coordinate the
qucstion-aml-answcr period which
will follow the speech.

Tickets for the speech are being
distributed at the booth below the
Drapcr pcrislylc through next
'l‘hursday from if) am. to 2 pm.
Studcnts are requested to bring
thcn‘ studcnt fax cards \\‘llll lhcm.

Ali's. Rooscvclt, who is widely
known for hcr humanitarian work,
has come to be known as thc l“ll'Sl
Lady of thc World. In a number
of polls taken by lhc American In-
stilulc of Public Opinion. she has
toppcd a list of lcn as the "most
admircd woman living today in any
part of the world."

in 1952. Mrs. Rooscvclt rcsigncd
as l'nitcd States (lclcgalc to the
l'nitcd Nations ticncral Assembly
al'tcr scrving in that capacity for
scvcn years. Since thcn she has
madc lhrcc world tours. and In 15).”)?
shc talkcd with Klii‘ttshchcv for
twoand a hall hours.

llcl' attitudc on l‘orcigu policy has
bccn dcscrihcd by onc obscmcr as
"an almost llill'il'lltilit‘tl I't‘itllSlll
with n profound faith that Amt-ri-
cons can do what has to bc doin-
it only wc know what it is "

Dr. Collins, President of the col-
lege, stated that there are some
fields proper to human inquiry
which do not lead to a teaching cer-
tificate. Such courses will be added
to the curriculum. A committee of
faculty has been appointed which
has been working since this sum-
mer on the development of new
programs and the revision of pro-
groms for those who will teach.
Because some students have enter-
ed Albany Statc in anticipation of
liberal arts courses, it will be pos-
sible for upperclassmen to be ad-
mitted into the new program when
it goes into effect. information on
such courscs will be available be-
fore thc December advisory pro-
gram for the second semester. Be-
cause interest in this program will
increase the number of graduate
students in the fields of liberal arts,
a graduate center which will offer
programs through the doctoral
level will be established at Albany.

According to Dr. Hamilton’s an-
nounccmcnt of September 29th the
two collcgcs at Albany and Plalts-
burgh will begin enrollment of
frcshmcn in the liberal arts pro-
grams m the l’all of 1962, the col.
legcs at Fredoilia and New Paltz
in 1963, the colleges at Geneseo,
()nconla and Potsdam in 1964 and
the colleges at Brockport and (‘ort-
