S. A. President. Dave Brooker
opened Wednesday's Senate meet-
iitg on an enthusiastic note by an-
nouncing that next week's meeting
would be brief because of State‘s
first night soccer game of the
season.

The first item on the agenda
was the 3rd reading of the finance
bill for the college radio station.
350 was appropriated from the con-
tingency surplus fund for paper
and printing expenses.

Last ’l‘hursday's karate dcmotr
stration was reported upon, and
President Brooker noted that Dcan

advised no further action until the
student body shows enough inter»

The matter of State College
News distribution was then dis-
cussed. It was generally indicated
that either a more efficient system
of distribution or the issuance of
more copies was needed. A move-
ment to prevent students from
taking tnorc titan one paper was
urged.

As usual. deliberation ovcr ideas
took place. The possibilities of in-
vesting the Senate surplus fund
was brought under question. and
provisions for either extending or
revising the S. A. (‘onstittttion
were introduced. (‘opics of the
State (‘ollcge Handbook are being
sent to each of the State (‘ollcgcs
iii order to acquaint them with our
system of student governmcnt. and
it is Iropcd that ideas from their
governing bodies will be received.

(lencral approval was expressed
for another Summit Conference to
be field this year. llopeful plans
for a conference will be brought up
at another meeting.

The campaign to cleait up the
t‘ommons was furthered by the
appropriation of more money to

trays and waste baskets will be
plentiful. and (‘ampus (‘ommission
was given a rousing hand in their
efforts to provide a “sanitary

The meeting ended with a word
of good cheer. Senator Scltleifer
