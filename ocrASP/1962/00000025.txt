however, are unaware that ours
is one of the few cities left in the
country so controlled. These citi-

almost alone have the opportunity

political machine, after all, is one

To the Editor:

On Wednesday evening, the res-
idents of Alden and Waterbury
Halls were served a (satisfactory
meal for a change. Though the
fare was meager, the food was
not mutiliated. Our complaint lies
not in the quality of the food,
but in the amount given to us.
Hardly enough turkey to make
half a sandwich was presented
to us, and it’s a small wonder we
didn’t have to turn in ration cou-
pons to obtain it. After finishing
, , the meal, second helipin‘gis were
"‘St‘tu' out of the question, and we were
forced to go away hungry. It‘s
quite risky, you know, to sneak
anything extra because someone
is likely to come tearing out of the
kitchen after you and grab it off
your tray.

The price of room and board
was raised this year. We are un.
able to understand, however, why
the quantity of food seems to have
decreased (those stufifcd peppers

Is it any wonder why the new
submarine sandwich shop does
such a booming business on late
evening snacks?

To those students at State who
have been fortunate enough to have

Dr. Millett has become more than
just a name and a paragraph in
a book; he is a vital and stimulat-
ing personality, an effective and
gifted teacher. lie is an Ameri 'an

with the "youth" that, he says, has
“rubbed off” through his years of
actively associating with college
students.

Life at State is umlouhtedly the
source of many new experiences
for Dr. Millett. Never having liv-
ed alone in an apartment before,
he is fascinated by his “marvel-
ous little efficiency apartment on
Willctt Sti‘cct." As yet. he has not
had the opportuiiily to see much
of the Albany area. but he has v'cn-
hired to express one valid opinion:
there aren‘t enough "good inovic'

Dr. Millett seems to be quite
pleased by the rcsults of ltis deci-
sion to accept Di'. Rich's offer of
a substantial salary and a fairly
light schedule. Although he vowed
three years ago that he would
"never set foot in a classroom

Why Nixon Is Running Program Aids

By JOSEPH (lALU

The first outgrowth of Richard
Nixon’s decision to run for gover-
nor of California is that a primary
battle will take place between Nix-
on and ex - governor (iootlwin
Knight. Knight has made the
charge that a Nixon supporter of-
fered him any appointive job in
the state if he supports Nixon.

If Knight is able to prove his
charge. it will be the end of Nix-
on‘s politi‘al life due to the fact
that he will be dis-barred.

The fact that Knight is a ‘icr
rific' 'ampaigncr was shown in '56
when he ran 3(i().(i(i(i votes ahead of

Edmund ( ’at) Brown showed his
'ampaigning talent when he dc—
fcatcd thcn Senator Knowland by
better than a million votes. Brown
is regarded as being at near peak
popularity. lie is in a good posi-
tion to make political hay in the
upcoming legislative session.

it Nixon is not dis-barred and
docs win the primary and the elec-
tion, he will face a hostile legis»
laturc, It is now and will remain
heavily Democratic.

View of Local Republicans

Nixon will have still more prob-
lems with the dominant conserva-
tive Republicans. lf Nixon's deci-
sion to avoid a 1964 presidential
race ads Rocky, then Nixon will
lose conservative votes in the pri-
mary.

\lxitll wants to remain in the
public cyc by showing his cxlcn-
sivc iuliiiinislralivc ability. This
will be difficult with the hostile lcgv

Why Nixon Is Running

\‘i'hy m the face of all these many
many compch and real drawbacks
is Richard Nixon running?

llc is running to hpr i‘crcli'cl
Republican Senator Tom lx’uclel
and to help Republican candidates
m the eight new House districts in
t'iilliiil‘iiltl,

He wants to remain in the public
eye and he knows he stands no
more chance of defeating Kennedy
in ltltil than Stevenson had in 195(3
with lkc. His final reason is that
hc wants to reverse the decaying
trcnd Within the ('alifornia Repub-
lican party.

gram has been initiated at Beth-
lehem Central lligh School. The

State College students in a prac-
tical teaching situation. It is hoped
that this experience will better
them for student teaching and ac-
quaint them with the school. At
present the students are assigned
to classification and maintenance
of class enrollment, typing, and
clerical work.

’l‘hosc working in the French dc-
partment are sorting and arrang—
ing records and books to be used
in the language laboratories. Lat-
er in the year they will be working
with the recording of tapes to be
used in such lalmratorics. One
State t'ollcgc student will be com-
piling a list of all texts and infor-
mation of use to hiin school stu-
dents in the field of French. 'l‘hcsc
lists will be distributed to thc stir
dents and one copy will be kept in
the library.

The student aids working in the
Iliology' Dcparliiicnt are correcting
papers and laboratory reports.
liwntnally they will aid the slit-
dcnts in remedial Work.

to make good at (may my soul

RPI and Union fraternity parties.

Expect your ride to be between

Lou, Spencer or Lionel. His job
is to be friendly and amusing all
the way to the party. Be nice to
him: he's probably frustrated.

When you arrive at the desig-

walk into the house. Then comes
the problem of locating dates. “lie
was here a few minutes ago,”
seems to be the most repeated
phrase, and soon the love of your
life will be led in by the ear.

Fraternity men should go into
real estate if their house tours are
any measure of their worth. You‘d
think we wanted to buy the place,
and if any girl has the audacity to
refuse a tour of old Zeta Iota, why
the crushed look on poor old
lioncl’s face would haunt her
dreams forever. it's OK to go and
see your dates room, but when
he turns out the lights so you can
see his etchings better (they glow
in the dark, of course) it’s time to
be suspicious. A good way to es-
-apc is to scream, "Charliell
'l'hcy'rc playing “llail Dear Old
chssclacr" on the piano and it‘s
my favorite song. Let’s (lash out
and listen." ('aution—ADo Not say
this at [‘nion. and also, you may
be in an cmbarrassing spot if the
fraternity has no piano.

(inc often meets strange people
at these parties. Sometimes one
finds (1) a barefoot, blurry-eyed
fellow with a beard walking aim-
lcssly around muttering something
about lost denture plates (2) a blond
girl with hair in her face who sits
on the floor cross-legged and
shricks, “Oh Toby! . . I’m soooo
boored!“ (3) a little short guy with
buck teeth who is always wanting
to start a thumper game (4) a tall,
gangly creature who comes up be-
hind you and whispers in your left
ear, “Are you my date?” while
managing to spill cold gin down
your back (5) some fraternities
have pct dogs.

A few final words of advice are
in order for anyone making their
first trek to Troy or Schenectady:
(ai know where the ladies room is
located (b) notice what your datc‘s
tic looks like. if he gets lost you
may not recognize him otherwise
(‘l subtlcly incntion your phone
number :is many times as possible
in conversation. Social oppoi‘ltlnilicr-
are numerous (d) drink lots of
milk at dinner.

Following the demonstration, ilic

concerned the equipment necessary
to put on such a match, how illt‘

such a club. Other questions per—

and the reasons for forming such
a club.
