AMIA football presented everything from tight defensive out, should see Mr. Munsey about

battling to wide open, free-swinging offense playing, as APA,
SLS, and KB came out victorious in the week’s three games.
APA started its season rolling with a 58-0 romp over the

of the team are thinning out alarm-
ingly. Anyone who comes out will

AI’A Wins First, Over TXO

Last Thursday, APA and TXO battled it out on Vet's Field in what
was the first official AMIA encounter for each team. The outcome was
a virtual “schlang” by APA over a definitely undermanned 'I‘XO squad.
Completing ll of 21 passes to 2 of 18 for tile losers, APA walked away
with their first victory of the young season. Led by “Rocky” Crowcll’s
passing, Bill Burnett and Bob Pollero’s receiving, and a hard rushing

over matter is the completion of
a race. Also it takes a lot of time
and running to get into shape for
a (‘ross-country meet. At present
there are about three men on the
squad, and about three more must
come otit before meets can be
scheduled.

 

defensive line, they were able to amass 58 points while holding the

opposition to “zilch.”

While the score is somewhat lopsided, there is much to be said

IVOZLced

about the spirited team of TXO. When one realizes that they were only

organized last year, and thus had to use better than half their members
to field a team, TXO’s showing appears to be better than commendable.
Pollero was the first man to hit the scoring column for the winners,
scoring on a left-end reverse from 20 yards out after a few minutes of
the first period had elapsed. Soon after, quarterback Crowcll followed
suit, also hitting on a left side run. Two Crowcll to Burnett touchdown
passes brought the score to 25-0, and by means of a TD pass to Chuck
Hunter, the “men in blue" lead by 32 points at the half time mark.
Dick Matis took control of the ’I‘XO offense at the start of the sec—
ond half and almost got it rolling, but the tiring squad could not respond

enough to put over a touchdown.

APA managed to push across an-
other 26 points in the second half,
with Crowcll chucking four ’l‘D
passes, two to Fred Curtis and
one each to Pollero and Burnett.

SLS Drops Waterbury

Sigma Lamba Sigma made its
opening A.M.I.A. football game a
success last Monday by downing a
determined Waterbury club, 18-7.

Both teams showed rock-ribbed
defensive lines in the first quarter,
but early in the second stanza SLS
quarterback George Anastas hit
end Faye Richardson to break the
scoring ice.

Anastas was on the scene again
a few moments later as he made a
spectacular interception and ran it
back for a 30 yard ’l‘D. To cap

The sturdy SLS defensive line.
however, was the big factor late
in the game. l’accd by big Dave
“’l‘urtlc” Symula, it repeatedly
crashed through to throw opposing
backs for huge loses and greatly
aided SLS‘s 18»? victory.

be held at 10 AM. tomorrow and
is under the supervision of John
Wallace.

’l‘he Sophomore team is in a very
strong position with the following a

tcmath, ’l‘ony Maeuluso, Bob Ben-
ton, t‘harlie White. Gordon Muck,
Dave .lcnks, and Bob Wieboldt. The
teaiii captain is Jon McGarity.

The class of '65 is counting on
Larry Flemming, Gary Moore, Don
Juckett, and Stan Krivo to provide
a nucleus of strength for the line.
Many of the freshmen have played
football previously in their hiin
schools; some on All Star or dis
trict teams.

Other probable frosh players are:
Len Sncddon, Cliff Rugg, Harry
Kenyon, Dave Sucato, Ralph Cut-
tone, Bill Colgran. Dave Gognier,

In This Corner ---

By BOB DAVIES

 

Last week there was a portion of the soccer story devoted
to an attempt at getting a crowd of Statesmen to the RPI
soccer game. . During this same week, there appeared several
posters hanging in the lower peristyles annonucing the fact
that there was a soccer game at RPI, that it wasn’t too far
away, that it was free, and that it wouldn’t take too much
effort to get to the game in order to cheer the team in a show
of support.

The response to these feeble efforts was very good indeed
as a large crowd from Albany State showed up at the game.
Three State cheerleaders (1’) also showed up at the game,
supposedly to lead the following in the support of the team.
The results of their presence, however, were unnoticed and
apparently absent.

As the game proceeded, no action was observed froth the
cheering section, as they remained seated, in uniform, in the
front row of the bleachers. The only time any attempt was
made to cheer the team was when the crowd rose spontane-
ously to applaud a fine play or at a crucial moment in the game.

If the game had been held at Albany, there would be a
large, usually receptive crowd available, which would support
attempts made at cheering. llochcr. the game was at ltl’l.
it might be argued. The crowd in attendance at the game was
strongly in the favor of Albany, both in attendance and enthu-
siasm. At several times during the game spontaneous cheers
of praise went up for the players and for the team. At no
time however, Wcl'c there any organich ('ltcci‘s.

If State is going to how a cheering squad at its games
then at least these cheerleaders can lead a chcermoncc in a
while I do not mean to offend anyone personally by these
comments btit I only wish to see something done about the
situation, if the idea of getting up in front of a crowd and
leading a cheer frightens a girl, thcti she shouldn't be a cheer-
leader. , .

CROSS-COUNTRY FLOUNDERING—TRACK LOOKS DIM
Although many persons have verbally stated that they
wanted to see a Cross-country team started at State, only about
two or three have been doing anything to bring the team into
reality. Mr. Munscy has been trying to get enough runners
together in order to field a team. It would be possible to get
several meets if only a team were ready and willing to work—‘—
oiit and get in shape for one. A distance runner is not made
overnight, so if more men do not come out. the idea of the
team will be dropped, destroying the work already done by
the meager few who have given time and effort for a team
established Oil the promises of many who have proven that
it will take more than enthusiasm to make a team.

TO THE

Varsity Booters Down RPI 3-1 Sat.
As Seiman's 2 Goals Paces Peds

The Albany State Soccer Team has blasted into a stron and flashing start, serving
a resounding 3-1 defeat to a fighting but hopeless RPI squad. The Statesmen started
the game with plenty of hustle and deteralnation to win but were held scoreless dur-
ing the first half by a strong RPI defensive squad. During the first half, State shot

about fifteen goals to five for RPI.

The only score for the Engineers was booted by re-

turning letterman, Leif Titland, who dropped a high floating kick into ‘he State goal

during the second quarter.

State scored twice in the third and once again in the fourth quarter.

Karl Heinz

Gerstenberg‘er was the first ped to tally in a fast-moving quick-breaking play. Erwin
Seiman, State’s up-and—coming Sophomore, scored the other two goals to set the win-
ning pace for the remainder of the game.

RPI almost scored a second goal in the third quarter when Vern Sage, RPI’s only
other returning letterman, booted one, but the referee called the goal back claiming
that an RPI man was interfering with the State goalie and prevented him from at-

tempting to block the kick.

The State squad was well represented defensively by fullbacks Gary Smith and Dave

Frank, halfback Ed Broomfield, and Goalie Gary Penfield.

Captain Ed Broomfield

showed excellent form at many times during the game, underscoring his excellent 0f-

fensive ball~handling

Many of the newcomers have been showing up well on the playing field and giv-

ing the needed depth to the line-up.

Erwin Seiman has been one of the top rookies this

yar and will probably continue as a key member of the squad in the following years.
Erwin handles the ball very well and is always hustling on defensive plays.
