CC. Invades Commons

Yesterday the Commons was closed. It might be closed
again today. Many students have been complaining because
student mail was inaccessable, because there was no place to
play bridge and no place to relax.

Unfortunately these same students did not think of these
things when they decided not to abide by the rules set by
Campus Commission. Last year students said they wanted
the State College buildings to be aesthetically improved so
that they could be proud of them. Senate accordingly gave
Campus Commission power to set new rules for the 'are of
the peristyles and the student facilities.

Because students would not deposit their rubbish in the
waste baskets provided, rules were made prohibiting all eating
in the (‘ommons Wednesday night a $15 floral centerpiece
was stolen from the room. Thus Some students have decided
that they would rather make a mess and live in it than have
a campus of which they can be proud. Unfortunately one
of these philosophies has to go.

Campus Commission asserts that it will do whatever the
student body wants. Students can have nice surroundings or
they can consider only their own momentary pleasure. Per-
haps Senate could conduct a student poll to determine the
majority attitude.

Once a policy is set. students would have to obey the rules
or be punished. The News feels that this punishment should
not include closing the Commons. Student mail is especially
important. The whole student body should not suffer becau>e
a few have no consideration.

Why Are You Rushing?

Now is the time for all good sorority sisters to be on the
lookout for prospective pledges. And. freshmen, now is the
time for all wise freshmen women to start considering what
it means to join a sorority.

There are a lot of reasons why girls join sororities. t'n-
fortunately too many rush just so they can say they are a
sorority member. Being of a member of a particular group
means more than just a sweatshirt and a pin. It means attend-
ing meetings, helping with Homecoming floats, participating
in the Christmas Sing, building a booth for State Fair, and
many other activities which are time-consuming. It means
being close to a certain group of girls. It means conforming
somewhat to group prejudices and behaviors. Remember the
loyalties of the group. Before you join a sorority, consider
not only whom you will be representing but also who will be
representing you. Consider, too, why you are being rushed.

icing a sorority member has certain advantages. Sorori-
ties help you to meet a lot of people and to adjust socially.
They often help you to be in the know about school events
and attitudes. However. if these are your only reasons for
joining, don’t do it. Remember you will be with this group
for the rest of your college days.

We have always advocated second semester sorority rush-
ing'; however. unfortunately, it will not second semester this
year. You can make a wise decision only if you really learn
to know the girls. This won't be your last chance to join.

l)o visit the sororities often. And good luck in making
your decision. It’s an important one.

Dr. Chen, a new member of the

is teaching economics, comes to us
from Shanghai, China. The schools
he attended in his early years are
remarkably like ours.

A student attends elementary
school for six years aitd then goes
to secondary school for an addi-
tional six years. ('hinese students
in high school settle dowit to hard
work earlier than we do. Their
work load is heavier arid they take
a wider selection of courses 'l'herc
is an oh\iotts absence of "extra-

graduate from such schools have a
background in math and science
which is the equivalent of that
which college freshmen in the l'. S.
receive.

Time: 2 p. in. Place: Brubacher
Game Room, Occasion: Activities
Day. Purpose: to acquaint the
freshmen and transfer students
with the extra-curricular activi-
ties of the State University College
of Education at Albany.

Saturday afternoon, the Class of
1965 obtained a preview of what
is in store for them during their
spare time while they are attend-
ing Slate t'ollege. The activities
that. a student enrolls in while at-
tending college often gives him the
necessary rcquirements to become
an advisor for a similar group
when he moves into the teaching
field.

As the event hegaii only a few
faded purple beanies eoitld be
seen walking across the
the game room. More people enter-
ed the room and the noise increas-
ed propiirtionally: however, the
group was very well mannered.

in one corner a person was re-
citing poetry while bongo drums
played in the background. Another
corner occame a studio for Wt‘lrIA
which broadcast music for the
three hour period. In the third
corner a typewriter could he heard.

around it screaming, “BEAT Ohio
State!" They always make it a
point to burn down the field house
once a year. Then they build a
new one. In that way, the state al-
ways has something to keep itself
busy. and State (‘ollege students
have something to look forward to.
When the rally was over. the foot-
ball playcrs pushed the lit; cheer-
leaders iiito the swimming pool.
()n the next day at the crack of
dawn. the parade started. Each ed-
ucation methods student ltad spon-
sored his own float representing a

"meaingful learning activity"
while all of lllilne watched and

the contest. It seemed in
the days of old that they used to
have floats inspiring school spirit.
btit since we won the Rose Bowl
ti times. we’ve been on an intellec-
tual kick.

Everyone watched the game on
closed circuit TV from the newly
reopened uptown branch of The
(‘age, btit it ended abruptly in the
Zird quarter when an Albany urchin
stole the football. The oiin other
substitute was a new pushball just
revived by Senate. but a conference
of old Rivalry t'hairmen decided it
just wouldn‘t do.

After the game some of the an-
cient alums hobbled down to see
the old campus which had been ad-
tlerl to Albany lligh Annex. Most
alums look a dim view of the fact
that the Albany lligh science de-
partment was tisiiig the peristyles
for underground rocket testing.

All sorts of things were happen-
ing back on campus. The Rivalry
Banner was successfully found by
the frosh under an abandoned golf
Ice. The alums were holding a
swingin‘ coke party in the Student
t'nion to celebrate the installation
of a wondertul new fan guaranteed
to considerably redtice radiation ex»
