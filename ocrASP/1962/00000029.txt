Homecoming Co-C/iairmen View
Week-end Feature and Tasks

Hy 'l‘l‘ID l)l'S;\.\'lC.\'l\'() and Jl'llY JOHNSON

We. the co-chairinen of Home-
coming Weekend tired. We
have had many meetings, writteit
stacks of letters. and have spent
more time in the offices of the
various members of the adminis-
tration than have even the stu-
dents with a .0-t index. i“l‘t)lll these
hundreds of letters, we have re
ceived enough replies to hold in
one liaitd — and yet we are not too
discouraged. After this 'l‘hursday
or Friday the majority of otir work
will be done.

If the bonfire is rained out. if
the parade is plagued by flat tires.
or if the dance is raided by the
SLA (State Liquor Authority), we
may then feel down-hearted — but
tve retu t to consider any of these
possibilities; they are among the
farthest things from our minds.

ill‘t‘

What we do Worry about is the
possibility that something else may
tiappeii We feel that, tired as we
are. we have arrayed most. of the
details now it is up to you. the
student body. The one thing over
which we have no control is the
attendance at the events of the
weekend. The food. music, aitd

schedule of events may be super»
lative. but it no

We are looking forward to at-
tending the week-end and hope to
see everyone of there too 7-

cheeringI the soccer team.

.\lan_v student gripes concerning
the (‘.ilIl)l‘t‘ of jazz. concerts leaittrtd
on campus have been heard just
in past weeks. in an attempt to
remedy this, the band to be fea-
tured on Sunday is one which we
are sure will meet with the ap-
proval of the students.

We realize that \'eteran‘s Field
is not a glorified replica of the
Polo (lrotmds or Yankee Stadium.
However, the atmosphere 'an be
incomparable to either of these
with the aid of “suitable” liqtiid

As We retire to our respective
residences Sunday night we hope
to be able to look back on a sitc-

Homecoming
Chairmen Try
Alumni Poll

I’pon the suggestion of Dr. lean
(‘ollins, President of the (‘oIh-ge.
the Homecoming chairmen, 'l‘ed
ltiisenanko and Judy .lohnson.
Juniors. decided to find out how
litany altiiiiiii were really interest-
cd in attending Homecoming week-
end this year. ’l‘cd and Judy do
cided that the best method for this
was to send out a survey to as
many aluiniiis as possible.

Surveys Mailed

Two hundred surveys were mailr
ed and the co-chairmen received
3.3 answers covering a random
sample of forty out of each class
froin 10.37 - 1061. Most of the re-
plies were received from the
clip-sins of 195‘.) - 1961.

lt'avorable Replies
were in

More than two to one
favor of attending the weekend.

The punch party is the most poptt»
lar event. The idea of a bttffct
dinner to be held between the
pitticli party and the dance was
al~o tavorably received.
Other Activities
Other activities which were in
clttdcd ill the survey were: Rivalry
Sing. l’cp Rally, ’ionfire, Alumni-
l"aculty Luncheon, Homecoming
l’arade, Soccer (lame, Dinner at a
soiority or fraternity house, a for»
iiial dance and a jazz concert.

Recent Graduate Observes
Alumni Graduate Students

ROMA'I‘OWSKI

it y ELAIN [C

This weekend, State's nonexist-
ent campus will most probably be
swamped by the usual tearful and
beer-full hugs and shrugs of home-
coming tlltlllllll. Friends, acquaint-
ances, total strangers. and one-
time enemies who haven't felt the
need to keep in touch with one
another during the past two to
twenty years will be re united by
exaggerated memories of vaguely-
renieinbcrcd escapades.

The spirit of unity under a coin-
mon bond (or bondage. as it might
have been considered by some
will flourish in soils that formerly
produced only the weakest at-
tempts at interest.

Nevertheless, coming home to
State must be a heart—warming ex-
perience for all graduates. It is a
chance for them to relive one of
the most interesting parts of their
ast: a chance to forget about in-
corrcctcd papers, unpaid bills. cry-
ing babies. and impossible inrlaws:
a chance to once again savour lllc
sweet and carefree atmosphere of
a collegiate existence.

Hut what of those tiltlrlltllt’l‘S
who caitttot come back for Home
coming - who cannot come back
because they've never left! 'l‘hese
perennial students fall into three
distinct categories:

1. 'l‘hose who succeed in chang
ing their majors often enough in
order to lack a sufficient number

of required hours at tltc end of
each semester to keep from grad-
uating. These students prowl the
Albany area for 5, 6 sometimes 7
years niitil they finally have no
Cllt)l('( bill to accept a Bachelor’s
degree. They usually wind up with
approximately 200 credit hours,
half of which are electives.

2. Those who realize that de-
grees are worth many times their
weight in gold.

15, Those who gradtiatcd, took
one look at the world, and ran
back to the safety of ivy-covered
irresponsibility.

Since this is a weekend devoted
to ahtiniii. we will ignore those who
fall into the first category. Ac-
cording to statistics, approximately
15'. of the Class of ’61 falls into
the remaining two sections. Un-
fortunately. it is impossible to
separate the status-seekers from
the cowards: both groups claim to
be only seeking to accummulate
which they intend to use in eru-
cating the youth of America.

Alter casual observation, it
seems that this year there are
more students back for ggaduate
yvork from the preceding graduat-
ing class than there have been in
other years. 15'; does not sotiiid
like a very large primortion, how
ever. it wotth be interesting to

compare it with the figures from
other years.
