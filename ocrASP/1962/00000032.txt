To the Editor:

We would like to compliment
Miss Stroud and her company for
the excellent letter which appeared
iii the News on October 6.

“One juice, one juice, one jitice

" these are truly the words
heard throughout Alden-Waterbury
dining hall at mealtime. The
quantity of the food is meager;
for example, one very small slice
of roast pork was served to us on
October S).

The quality is usually good:
however. the salsbiii'y steak did
taste like hamburger cooked it]

tixydol; the Sunday steak was de—
licious; yet, it was the size of an
expectant shoestring.

Let us examine the cost of one
of the meals served in the A-W
dining hall: two hot dogs at 15c
at most lunch stands, one scoop
of beans at 5c (maximum), left
over salads, pic at about 15c, one
juice at 5c.

Motility bread is nice if you have
a cold r~ free penicillin.

And now let us comment on the

living conditions. The halls and
bathrooms are dirty. Algae-like

stuff is growing in the stnks. A col-
lection of razor blades, etc. has
been on one bathroom shelf since
the beginning of school.

Lounges —- how can you lounge
in a furnitureless lounge, the floor
is rather hard.

Sayles wasn’t so bad after all!
Was it, guys?

SIX EX-SAYLESMICN.

To the Editor:

1 am pleased to see that the
campus commission has been
cleaning tip the bulletin boards,
etc. However, I wonder who per-
mits free advertising for cer-
taiti commercial establishments‘.’ 1
grant that places where one can
continue his liberal education are
of interest to students and faculty.

1 do not disapprove of this
charming place, but I would like
to know just who is placing these
advertisements anonymously.

Aren't the walls of State College
reserved for the advertising of
State College activities? Let the
Cafe Lena be supported by some
organization or individuals con-
nected with State College, but not
by a ghost poster poster.

State Holds

New Name

The State University Board of
Trustees has announced that the
University’s eleven Colleges of Ed-
ucation have a new name as of
Friday, October 13. Albany State's
official title is now the State Uni-
versity College at Albany.

The Trustees’ action follows ap-
proval last month by the Board
of Regents of the University’s plan
to establish undergraduate curri-
culums in the liberal arts and sci-
ences at the teacher education
colleges. A program of gradual
and orderly transition of these col-
leges to multi-purpose institutions
will be initiated.

Since non-teacher education stu-
dents eventually will be admitted
to study general programs at the
colleges over a varying schedule of
dates, from 1962 to 1965, the Trus-
tees determincd their names should
be changed to reflect this depar-
ture from their previously highly
specialized nature.

l’at Benedetto, (trand Marshal of
t'ampus Commission, has comment-
ed on the closing of the Commons.
Because of the condition in which
the Commons has often been found,
C a tit p u s (‘om mission suggested
closing it the day after it is found
untidy.

Although Senate has approved the
rules and regulations of Campus
(‘oi.-.mission, including locking the
Commons, the student body has
protested it. if the Commons is
closed in the morning, it will be
open in the afternoon so that stu-
dents will have access to Student
.\lail.

if anyone desires an open meet-
ing with t‘ainpus (‘oniiiiissioii, that
meeting will be held.
