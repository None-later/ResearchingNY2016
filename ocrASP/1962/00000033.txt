STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1961

 

Senate, We Approve!

It has long been the unofficial policy of the News to
knock Senate. Today we would like to reverse this attitude
somewhat.

We commend Senate for the work of such groups as
the Services Committee, for its interest and aid in organiz-
ing the radio station, for its efforts to help Campus Corn-
mission clean up the Commons, and for last week’s dis-
cussion of the school health and insurance policy. We hope,
that this beginning enthusiasm will continue through the
year.

We feel that Senate this year has honestly tried to
contribute something to our college, to consider and enact
important legislation, and to raise the student‘s viewpoint
of the college. And we hope that the long hours of discus-
sion will be turned into action.

However, we wonder if the individual Senators are
honestly attempting to represent the students. We do not
intend to suggest that a Senator should be merely a mouth—
piece for the majority of his class. However, we do feel
that Senators should try to reach more students in their
discussions of Senate issues.

Pe“haps we might as aptly put the question another
way: does the average student really care about his student
government? Don‘t people care where their money goes?
Upperclassmen, there are Senators representing you. 'Give
them your ideas and attend Senate meetings to see what
your Senators do. Freshman, attend Senate. Your interest
and participation will prepare you for future positions of
responsibility in student government.

Isn‘t college to prepare us for the life we will lead as
adults? If so, shouldn‘t we, as college students, be prepar-
ing ourselves for assuming adulthood and responsibility?

Why, then, do so many of us act as though this is the
period in our lives when we can throw caution to the winds,
sow some wild oats, and have a last fling?

Particularly in our education courses, we hear a great
deal about professional standards. Too many of us asso-
ciate these ideals with the proper attire rather than the
necessary ideals.

Disillusioned ?

Perhaps we really are part of a generation that has
been disillusioned about the basic values of society. We
feel that we must conform to the code of superficia‘itv or
to the code of combating the values of society. We rec'rct
that there is so little decency in the world.- Yet Wt‘btll't‘
more interested in being impressive than in establisliitit'
the values that we feel society lacks. h

‘ TlllS past week the lack of judgment of many State
College students has been more blatant than ever. Alumni
too, have come back to tell us to start growing up while
we are lll college. We must remember not only that we
damage our own reputations. not onlv that our attitude
often dctcrn'iincs the job We secure, but also. and more
important, that. our standards in college affect our dc—
vclopnient as mature individuals. What sort of character
do Wt‘ want to show our students'.’

To the Editor:

The rules of this college state
that a student must live in college
maintained or approved housing.
In order to dwell where one clioses,
he must receive permission from
the college. 1f the person, specifi-
cally a girl, chooses to have off-
campus residence, then the per—
mission is only granted to seniors
and those others having unusual
circumstances. There was a time
when parents, in sending their
child off to the “big city" college,
were definitely in favor of the col-
lege assuming the responsibility
for the social conduct of their
child. However. if the parents com-
pletely and specifically absolve
the college of such protective res-
ponsibility, is the college justified
in retaining such “delegated” auth-
ority? Of course, the school tid—
ministrators may reply that many
parents are indulgent with their
children, and would grant this
permission without considering
the responsibility and social ma.
turify of the child. This may well
be true. biit such parental per.
mission annuls the premise on
which the school assumes its auth.
ority.

Here is also the "implied" auth-
autliority which comes throng
the school's reputation within the
community. Any person living
within college housing or off cani-
pus certainly must maintain the
reputation of the college. However.
if persons must be protected
through four years of college be-
cause _t_hey are so immature that
they cannot carry themselves with
dignity, then, at the end, they are
not ready to assume their places
as teachers of the nation‘s youth
and leaders in a community or
society. Of course, maturity is not
something which happens to an
individual over night or between
hiin school and colleges or college
and career. It is a gradual pro:
cess and some complete or near
completion of the process sooner
than others. It is contrary to the
American ideal of fair play and
“getting ahead" to forbid someone

who feels mature enough to get
oitt on their own to do so. There

are always those who would fall
by In" wayside, and the mollv-
cuddling of regulated dormitory
life only prolongs the period be-
fore the fall. liiit It does not prc

To the Editor:

Regarding the article of October
13, 1961, Music Council would like
to make clear to the Student Body
and to Senate that the llomecom-
ing Jazz Concert is sponsored by
Music Council. State (‘ollege News
through no fault of its own did not
recognize this fact. Total recogni-
tion should not be given to the
Ilomceoming Committee, although
they worked hard to help us.

To the Editor:

Douglas MacArthur once stated,
“()ld soldiers never die, they just
fade away."

The world famous general must
have had State (‘ollege in mind,
somewhere back deep in the col)-
webbcd corners of his brain. Many
of the “old soldiers" of the alumni
ranks were missing this past week-
end, btit there were enough of
them on hand to insure a gay, tu-
multuous weekend. Speaking on be»
half of all the “old grey mares'
and lost grandaddies." we would
like to take the opportunity to
thank 'l‘ed l)usanoko and Judy
.lohnsoii (('o-(‘liairnien of Home-
coming Activities), l‘rcsideiit and
Mrs t'ollins, and all those connect
ed with the planning and carrying

superb and deserving of commend-

fered from lack of graduate gour-
mets. but then. we understand that
the present l'l‘sltlt‘tlls of the dorms
have been complaining about not

the alumni group took pity and do

To the Editor:
Despite the rain, Homecoming

Weekend was a success. Thanks to
all those loyal Albany Staters who
turned out for the parade and the
soccer game in the cold rain. The
floats were better than ever and
the game became an 8-0 victory for
Albany.

The large turnout at the dance
was an unexpected but welcomed
surprise. We apologize to those peo-
ple who found it uncomfortable to
remain at the dance for any great
length of time. The dance was held
at one of the largest places in the
area so the only way to solve this
problem next year is to have a lim-
ited number of bids given otit to
students ‘ tindei‘classmcn and al-
umni.

TV Slogans

Since we of this college of educa“
tion will in the near future have to
take it upon ourselves to educate
young America, it seems only fit-
ting that we not only teach in
school, but also do all within our
power to broaden cultural horizons
everywhere. Since one of the ways
of reaching these tender, budding
young minds is through the mass
media of television, it is shameful
that almost the only programs
scheduled on TV. are adult west-
crns and defective stories. The
main reasons for this is that the
general public seems to prefer
these to intellectual programs like
Shakespearean drama. Ilowevcr,
we have come up with a solution to
this problem. In order to watch
these “lower caliber” programs
they have to see commercials, so
why can‘t we slip a few choice lines
of the great Elizabethan bard into
tliem‘.’ They may even begin to like
it For instance:

yoti do. Take a seat in the front
row right next to the teacher's desk.
That's where all the pushch sit
and the back row gang next to the

cion by scholarly eyes. Never take

The
Men ifgzrindeir

By ANNE DUGAN

madly when you aren't looking wide
eyed and fascinated. Nod your
head occasionally and look thought-
ful.

When he asks a question, don’t
slump in your seat and look studi-
ously at the ceiling intently at-
tempting to count the light bulbs.
Wave your hand madly and look in-
formed. Thumb through your note-
book and try to find invisible sta-
tistics to back up your answer.

The teacher will pause. He sees
you are anxious and he will make
a mental note—“Quite a worker,
there! " He knows you know. Do you
think he‘s going to call on you? Of
course not; he wants to see if some-
one clse is just as bright. The poor
bored cluiinp with his neck out the
window studying the pigeons will
get the as while you chalk up a
Dean's l.ist reputation.

.\'ow comes the social aspect of
college life. Any girl can get a
party girl reputation with a mini-
mum of effort. When you sign out
of your dorm. pitt "date" for every
destination ~ even grocery shopping.
Your lionseiiuithcr and everyone
who sees the signout sheet will
think you're tremendously popular.

A datclcss Saturday night should
cause no problem with the old peer
group. (in Saturday afternoon. ask
e\cl'yonc on your corridor to listen
for your buy/er because you‘re cx-
pectinu an important call. They
won't listen. so it really doesn't
matter if" no one calls yoit. l’ose
in front of the mirror in several
different outfits and ask evci'yone's
opinion.

Rush upstairs from dinner and
immediately set your hair. put cold
cream over your face and polish
your nails in a very conspicuous
spot. At about 7:30 pm, gather
together soap. hath powder, per-
fume. and lots of towels and make
a definite point about taking a
shower. After that, borrow several
things from different people you
know. evening ha gs, jewelry,
scarves and sweaters will do.

'At about 8.510, lock yourself iii

your room and DON'T go any»
where l’ut an “()nt” sign on your

door and scchide yourself. If you
follow this practice for several
weeks. you will find yourself the
most sought after girl in the dorm.
l-iycryone will want you to find
them blind dates and that’s for you
to figure out?
