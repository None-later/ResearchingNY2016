A real boon to those avid short
story readers who find the number
of American magazines published
becoming too large for them to
keep ftilly abreast of contemporary
American short story writers, is
the hard-bound collection entitled
The Best American Short Stories,
1961. edited by Martha Foley and
Dave Burnett, and published by
iioughton Mifflin, ($5.50).

This anthology, carefully culled
from a legion of magazines, rep-
resents the editors‘ choices of the
best stories to be published in 1961,
and the authors represented,
though for the most part a young
group, give indications of making
the coming years a gala era for
the short story.

While the influence of lleming-
way continues unchecked, his in-
novations have been extended, re-
shaped and the result is a short
story form of unique quality. it is
a form that is iiitensly active, iii-
deed. sometimes brawliiig, and
yet, at the same time, it remains
deeply introspective. There seems
to have been a wedding between
the outer and inner man, and the
combination proves an exciting
one.

Nickel Misery

Evidence of this development is
found in “The Nickel Misery of
G e o r g c Washington Carver
Brown." by ivan (loltl. This fast-
paced story is interspersed with
enough sympathetic humor to al-
low the reader to catch his breath.
Mr. Gold delves into the mysteri-
ous world of an Army Basic Train-
ing Center and the miseries which
a patlieric southern Negro farm
boy, George Washington Carver
Brown, undergoes.

Brown, the butt of the entire
company's frustrations. would be a
hilarious low~comedy character if
the episodes he becomes involved
in were not culminated in the final
horror which the author so skill-
fully suggests throughout but ncv»
cr states outright. until the boy is
suddenly and shockingly killed.

This is a story about the race
problem. but it is unlike the usual

By WILLIAM FRANKONIS

seeks to break the mold. The story,
in spite of some confusing philo-
sophical dissertation, carries well,
portraying middle class life among
Jewish families with adeptness and
humor; and instead of falling into
the traps of obscurity so abundant-
ly present in a story of Man’s
struggle with his duality, the auth-
or keeps the conflict both plain
and plausible. The conflict is par-
tially resolved when the character
decides: “I am confused, therefore
i am." The author offers his
solution to the reader by liaran-
going the reader in a short, effec-
tive epilogue.

Finally, the shock, or twist, end-
ing is given new life in Samuel

 

SiiOl'L, KOREA—Robert Burgess, Professor

Sandmei's, “The Colleagues of Mr.
Chips." By artfully lulling the
reader into a sense of confused
(but false) security and humor,
the author’s bombshell, when it is
dropped, produces an effect start-
ling to a point that would make 0.
tilenry envious, and again, the
reader eventually realizes that
there is bitterness behind this
story as well, but this time. it is
the full bitterness of the adolescent
for the system that makes him
secondary to lesser tasks. The
author has obviously carried and
nurtured this dormant bitterness
for a long time. This story is es-
pecially appropriate for prospec-
tive teachers.
