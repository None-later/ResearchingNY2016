Men’s Fashions
Men’s fashions this fall have
taken a turn toward mixed colors
and the “heavy look” in fabrics,
according to the manager of a
Kansas men’s store.

Short raincoats with the Sherpa
lining, which looks like sheepskin,
and the suburban-length coats are
very popular among college sets.
These coats give the appearance
of being heavy btit are really light-
weight.

Soft sweaters in argyle patterns
are beginning to catch on. Another
modern innovation is the Conti-
nental or Piper Pant, slim trou
sers in plaid and check patterns.
