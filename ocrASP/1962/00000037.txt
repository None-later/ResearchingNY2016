The Crisis

The faces of SUCA students for the past two weeks
have been as deeply furrowed with worry lines as those
of the early Americans must have been during the great
American crisis. Thomas Paine wrote of that crisis,
“These are the times that try men’s souls . . . " A more
apropos phrase could not describe the mid-semester crisis
here at State.

We have always noticed an attitude of disgust on the
part of the student body around mid—semester time, but
never have we noticed such seriousness of purpose as we
have this year. This is as it should be, although in the
past, such seriousness has been reserved for the final
CI‘lSlS.

However, this attitude has not only affected the study-
ing approach towards mid-semester exams, but participa—
tion in extracurricular activities as well. We wonder if
this change in attitude is portentious of the kind which
will prevail for the remainder of the year. We certainly
hope not. Apathy about extracurricular activities has long
been a source of attack at this college. Total disinterest,
perhaps a subversive tributary of this new attitude, could
become a source of a full scale war.

The reasons behind this attitude are various and too
complicated to be reiterated here. But three solutions
bcome evident: “Be prepared!" If this doesn't work, “Don‘t
cry over spilled milk." And always remember, “There is
a time to laugh and a time to cry."

Revue in Europe?

Recently, the State College Revue received information
that it may be considered for a seven-week European tour
sponsored by the Defense Department. Four years ago,
when “Boyfriend” was produced, the group received appli-
cation forms for a comparable tour, but due to certain com-
plications further consideration had to be suspended.

These tours are managed by the American Educational
Theatre Association, Inc, which selects approximately ten

schools to participate each year. The S.U.C.E. at Brock-
port is among those schools presently touring Europe.

Individual expenses are covered by the Defense De-
partment. Each member of the company receives $7 per
day for living expenses and is given a $10,000 life insur-
ance policy plus sickness and accident coverage.

However, the college must pay all production expenses
except for transportation and royalties. The school would
also have to assume some measure of responsibility for the
students while they are abroad. Of course, the tour would
probably be impossible during the school year because of
the interruption of studies.

Nevertheless, if proper arrangements could be made,
the experience would prove valuable to members of the
Revue as drama students, as education or liberal arts ma—
jors, and as professional men and women.

In addition, the prestige of the school and the reputa-
tion of the five-year-old Revue would be greatly enhanced
if State‘s group is chosen.

We sincerely hope that the obstacles will be properly
evaluated and overcome.

To the Editor:

In last Week's State College
News. a short paragraph 3D9031'0(l
in your “Commoo-Stator" column
under the sub-title of “Milne Mala-

 The writer wanted to know
who “owns” Page Field, the col-
lege or Milne gym classes'.‘ The
statement referrcd to a "Prepon-
derance or restrictions” against
use of the field by college students.
and asked if we were afraid that
our volleyball might be intercep-
ted.

Milne does not “own” Page
Field any more than the (‘ollege
“owns” If. We would like to re-
mind the college students that it
is not a question of" who has title
to this field. It is a question of who
has title to this field. It is a ques-
tion of 'lhe Milne School attempt»
iii': to conduct physical education
classes and intramural programs
on a field which has been disig-
nated for this purpose. The field
is somewhat inadequate in size to
begin wttli, and this is compounded
considerably by the periodic
stream of college students walking
flush into the middle of these
classes.

This, quite obviously. creates a
safety hazard which should he eas-
ily recognized. It also creates a
problem for us in attempting to
conduct classes when our pupils
have to avoid moving obstacles in
the form of college students.

Let us cite a few examples. We
have actually seen students walk
lhrotigli the middle of a volleyball
game and walk right into the net
ii'e have observed the students
strolling in front of a batter ready
'o swing at the ball, walk throuin
a football game, and even through
a class lined up for mass calisthc-
nics. In almost every case, these
students never quicken their step
or veer from their original cotirse.
ihiy stem completely oblivious of
their interference with M iliic
classes. It is amazing to us how
anyone. especially future teachers.
can be so discourteous aiul so iii-
considerate,

We do not believe this present
situation is necessary Some years
age someone decided to coitstrucl
sidewalk completely :ironnd Page
field. If he were alive today he
would be sorely disappointed by
the limited use these sidewalks
are getting.

We will admit. as the column
stated, that it has been necessary
to put tip a “prcpondcriiiice of re-

strictions" from time to tune in
an attempt to divert traffic These
restrictions have been itt placing

We then passed into the main cafe-

The Family

Weekly had an article about Niagu
ara Falls. Apparently one of our
intrepid alumnae was the first wo-
man, yea the first person to brave
that torrent. Let me recount the
feat of Anna Edson Taylor as it is
recorded in a tattered October 25,
1901, New York Times.

Iler defense against the murder-
ous flood was a wooden barrel four
and one-half feet in diameter. Mrs.
Taylor was secured by a shoulder
strap to protect her neck. She
breathed through a hose inserted
in a hole near the barrel top. She
was set adrift on the Canadian side
of the Falls. The calm above the
brink and then the suction of the
Falls were felt. For a moment the
barrel poised on the brink and then
plunged 10.") feet into the river be-
low. M rs, Taylor was rescued both
alive and conscious.

How much this (launtless heroine
could have added to our college's
rich heritage. Ilow she wanders
through the darkening mist of time,
forgotten. Some thoughtful journal-
ists have left us bits and pieces of
her life. Our Anna was married
at nineteen and widowed at twenty.
She crossed our land eight times.
She died pennilcss, nearly blind
and alone.

()ur registrar. bead librarian. sec-
retary to President (.‘ollins, and
Mrs. Brimmer have been searching
for our Anna. Lists of grads from
the Normal School at Albany have
been studied carefully. No one can
find her. we can contribute nothing
to the memory of this brave, cour-
ageous woman. For us, she never

lived, never (lied, never braved
the thunder—cliffs of Niagara. So
be it.

Once upon a time there was a
clever, upright, stalwart and free-
thinking young chap named Filbert
Fink. Filbert decided to attend
State College (hurray), but when
he came here, only one thing mar-
red bis placid existence —— he suf-
fercd from insomnia.

Night upon night, Filbert tossed
and turned upon his humble pallet.
(He couldn’t afford a bed—that's
why he came here) as thoughts
powerful enouin to add to the wis-
dom of the ages kept him awake.
Finally he decided sleep was im-
necessary, and he took to writing
philosophical theses in the wee
hours of the dawning day. His mind
bummed with great ideas and he
spent his time pursuing knowledge

Filbert wanted to be in the swing
of things. however. When he came
to State he discovered that most
people spent their every waking
hour in a lethargic stupor. Being
bltiri'y»eyed the morning after was
‘in," and sitting bright-eyed and
rarin' to go with poised pen in band
at an eight o'clock was “out.”

All of Filbert‘s friends stumbled
through their morning classes with
a sense of ditty, although some felt
that the eight and nine o'clock iii-
striictors were robbing them of
their weltdeserved rest. Even so,
they were gracious enough to put
up with such inconveniences twice
a week. But bucking up enough
for a two o'clock was indeed a pain
beyond endurance. In the bright
hours of the afternoon, these world»
weary and care-worn martyrs shuf-
fled homeward (or skipped gaily to
a rush party) with good intentions.
After a page or two of some moldy
old text, what could be better than
a little nap before dinner (helps
the appetite). Then after all that

down and recover.

When Filbert saw what a rest—
ful institution he was attending,
what could he do but escape into
a daily dream world. llis typewrit-
er kept people awake during the
afternoon, and after he learned how
to play bridge and poker, his hours
after dark were well spent. Once
or twice a month he would stay up
all night to prepare for a paper or
an exam and then he would rest for
a week afterwards. He became so
upset at registration time because
all the ten, eleven, and twelve
o'clock classes were shut out, that
he went straight home and devel-
oped a case of mono.

Despite all obstacles to Filbert's
scholarly success. he ended up per-
fectly acceptable with a 20003 in-
dex.

Things began to change in Fil-
bert's life. liowcter, He didn‘t
