because the students are faithful,
pleasant and very intelligent."

uages. Dr. Goggln has taught Latin
and Greek to State students for 2!
years. and has received a rich

Year in Greece

Following her education at Bar-
nard, Dr. Goggin was awarded a
fellowship for a year's study a-
broad Greece was her chosen
country, and her year there was
"the most wonderful year of all."
She studied at the American School
of ('lassical Studies in Athens and

ence of seeing ancient tradition

markable sense of clarity. Dr. (lof-
gin reports that the lreek people

hospitable and that literary tra-
dition prevails in their daily lives.

Current Comment:
Mrs. Roosevelt
On Communism

By Joe Galu

If you recall my article of two
weeks ago, you will realize what
I meant by my statement that this
talk started at the conventional
tme for all such talks.

Speaking about how we can best
infltience the world against Coma
munism. .\lrs. Roosevelt stated her
Democracy in our anti-(‘ommunist
belief that we must be more Dro—
l)eniocracy in our anti-(‘om-
iiiunism.

There is no one best way to in-
fluence the entire world against
the forces of Communism accord-
ing to Mrs. Roosevelt (among oth-
ers.)

Some of the ways she mentioned
are to learn about the many facets
of Communism. to study the effects
of isolatzonism in America on the
view of Americans by foreigners.
and to teach our children that the
fight against (‘ommunisni may
well be theirs tomorrow as it is
ours today.

In a reference to our open so
ciety versus the Russian closed
soc;ety. she stated that we must
be better than the slogans conferred
upon us by the Russians.

In a light note she referred to
the fact that a few years ago the
Russian peoples were living un-
der five year plans. These gave
way to ten year plans and now to
a twenty year plan She also re-
ferred to a dinner she planned for
Mr Kruslichev where he had time
for only one bi‘n

For 4th Defeat of Season

The State Varsity Soccer team was handed its first
defeat in seven starts this past weekend by Oswego. The
teams were evenly matched and the play was rough.

In th first half, Ed Walsh was injured. Ed's job was
to guard Bob Thule, a dangerous scorer. It was just after
his injury that ’I‘hule scored the only goal of the half. Our
key men were bottled up by sharp defensive play by Oswego
and by a series of double-teams. Later Franz ZWicklbauer
was also hurt; both these players will be in the game Sat-
urday.
In the second half. it was once again Oswego who led
the scoring. Both Jim Jarvie and Tom Santay scored giv—
ing Oswego the end—of—the-quarter edges 3—0. Both Al
Ciejka and Dave Schryer played outstanding ball as re-
placements for our injured players.

Karl Heinz Gerstenberger scored two goals in the
fourth quarter, making the score 3-2. Santay put the game
on ice with his second score of the day. making the final
score. 4—2.

Coach Garcia had several comments on this past
week's game. “As I said last week. this was Oswcgo's Home—
coming game This had a great deal to do With the final
outcome. The teams were even in ability and speed. How-
ever, their student body turned out in great numbers, giv-
ing their team the edge. This Week's game with Bridgeport
is a home contest and if we could have half the number
of students that Oswego had at their game I am sure it will
make a great difference in the final outcome of the game."

As for statistics, Bridgeport is a good all-around squad.

They are t‘ett.le(l to be agile and

ually one of the best teams in the

. . . a growth industry may also be an old business that’s
on the verge of new development. Shortly after leaving

This is just one example. The really important thing
to remember is this: When you set your sights on a career,
aim for an industry that is going to grow, so you can grow
with it. It’s the difference between a rocket that blasts
off, and one that just sits there. Good luck!”
