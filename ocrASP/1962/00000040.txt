To the Student body,

in the State. College News of 0c-
tober 13. 1961, there appeared a
double page spread devoted to
Camp Dippikill, its past and pres-
ent stages of development, its pos-
sible future uses. the architect's
estimates on construction costs.
and his drawings and plans for a
building.

Personally, I had hoped to be
swamped by reactions # favorable
and unfavorable. written or verbal,
every day of the week. So far, one
solitary student has come to share
his ideas on llippikill with me. Do
you realize that you have already
spent ovc :é'"(i.tltltl on the acquisition
of this propt rty aiiil its partial de-
vclopmenl" .\re you aware that you
lia\e set aside some .‘s‘ﬁitiiltltl addi-
tional for capital construction"
These actions. I would remind you

To The Editor:

The literary conference was con-
cerned with the problem of putting
otit a magazine representing all
forty‘eight units of State Univer-
sity. We feel the idea is absurd.
The individuals involved haven’t
any idea how to select material,
nor do they have definite plans
how one should submit. A plan was
drawn up by dreamers who en-
visioned a twenty-five thousand
dollar budget to be presented to
the l’l'i's‘itlt‘lll of the University.
The president. seeking to get these
writer people off his back offered
llli'lli one thousand dollars and
ilooil wishes. The tlreiiiiiei‘s told its
of their efforts. and we sat back
and wondered why

The

Bear Batter

By JIM IIAENLIN

“I wandered lonely as a crowd”
Spencer Potrzebie

Throughout its brief history it
has been the policy of the Bear
Baiter to perform various public
services ranging from tours of the
campus to notes on dating habits.
This year. for its first appearance,
we have decided to delve into the
ever-popular topic of fraternities
and perform another public service
by giving a few historical sidc-
lights on fraternities at state.

in recent years fraternity growth
has been fairly slow and there are
at present five fraternal groups on
campus. But more years back than
most can remember, ll"(.‘ went
through a fantastic period of growth
and at one time numbered over
tutti member organizations. ’l'ypi-
cal of these was LXIX.

l..\’l.\ w as founded in lSl—- by
Spencer l'otr/ebie tsee above).
and consisted of one member.

Spence by the meiiibei‘s of his frat»
eriiily. sought somethingoffered by
nonc of the other fraternities. an
til“‘lllil/lllltlll suited to a very spec
i:il type of personality his He dev
signed his fraternity to meet two
s|i('t'lll(‘ needs. group identification
and singularity.

oncnian fraternity is somewhat
limited in its functions. Not so
LXlX. Spencer functioned as any
ordinary fraternity He had his own
house, at ‘th llraper l’eristyle, and
engaged in all normal social activ-
ilics.
