A More Effective Rivalry

As Rivalry comes to a close this weekend, we cannot
resist wondering just how much of the purpose of this pro-
gram has been achieved.

The Handbook defines Rivalry as a “competitive period
of contest and fun between the freshman and Sophomore
classes . . . to unite the individual classes . . . and to help
the frosh become accustomed to college life." The Hand-
book also states that during Rivalry the Class of 1965 will
become organized and will develop class and school sp1r1t.
The keynote of the whole program is the development and
display of the spirit of cooperation and good sportsman-
shi .

pWe wonder if such a spirit has really been developed
and displayed. Is cooperation really a part of Rivalry?
Perhaps for each class; but, we feel that this year there has
been little general cooperation between the two classes.
except for rushing.

We wonder if Rivalry really does help the freshman
adjust. They do have fun. They do make friends. How-
ever, it is the same few students who participate in every-
thing. In this way Rivalry does help to point up the lead-
ers, but those who do not participate at all can receive no
benefits. Academic interests suffer when a few do all of the
competing. I

However, the main evaluation of Rivalry concerns
school spirit. Participation in class events does not seem
to have carried through to participation in all-college or-
ganizations. Is it because the potential leaders are so
swamped with Rivalry the ﬁrst quarter that they never get
around to joining the campus clubs?

Proud of State College

Last week we attended a national press conference in
Miami, Florida. Feeling that we had an unusual oppor-
tunity to learn about people in other schools and other
parts of the country. we did a lot of watching and listen-
in ‘.

g We were shocked by some of our observations. .We
had expected a certain amount of discrimination against
Negroes, but we had thought that college students would
be more liberal than the older Southerners? However, these
students would not even stand near a Negro. Sometimes
some rather biting comments were made about them. We
were ashamed. The situation must have been extremely
difficult for the Negro student from the 'North'ei‘n.in~
tegrated college who is not used to such discrimination.

We were also surprised to hear that national fraterni-
ties and sororities, even those having many chapters in
the North, had unwritten rules against admitting Negroes.

Also unexpected was discrimination against students
who did not belong to fraternities and sororities. We
learned that in many schools fraternal groups hold a power
balance so that students advance solely on the basis of
the fraternity to which they belong. Independents have
no chance whatsoever.

Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the con-
ference was the number of students who carried personal
enjoyment to such an extreme that they did not have time
to attend any meetings, discussions. or lectures. We ap—
prove of parties. Meeting people informally is one of the
most worthwhile parts of a conference. However, there IS
a limit 7— especially when your school is providing the
money.

We thought the conference was outstai‘idingly con-
structive and interesting. The surroiuulings were beauti-
t'ul. Many students who were both friendly and aware of
the purpose of such a convention attended.

Yet certain attitudes caused us to disrespect some
students and the schools they t‘i-pi'csct’it, We are glad to
be back.

By PAT KIRBY

This week the subject for our
faculty interview is Dr. Mary E.
Grenander. a member of the Eng—
lish department at State since 1948.
Dr. Grenander’s field of special-
ization is American literature. She
is particularly interested in Am-
brose Bierce and his work.

A native of Wisconsin, Dr.Gren-
ander received her A.B. Degree.
her Master’s and her Doctorate
from the University of Chicago.

Articles

Especially active in her own
field, Dr. Grenandcr has had sev-
eral articles published on Henry
James, John Donne, Charles Dick-
ens and Ambrose Bierce, but her
interests certainly are not confined
here.

Previous Positions

Prior to her assignment at State.
she spent four years in the Navy.
during which time she attended
midshipman training school at Mt
llolyoke (‘ollege and WAVE school
at Iliinter (‘ollegc. Upon the com
pletion of her training she (lid per
sonnel work for the Bureau of
Ships in Washington. D. C.

Dr. (trenander spent the last fivo
semesters in France on a Full-
bright li‘ellowsliip. She taught at the
University of Lille during the first
semester and at the I'niversity of
Toulouse during the second. Om-
of the interesting things that she
noticed about her French students
was that they were quoting Dr. \'i»
vian Hopkins. an associate here at
State. on the subject of Robert
Frost.

Interests

Other interests held by Dr. (lrcir
ander extend froin her membership
in the ’l‘ri-(‘ity I’cncer‘s (‘lubwshe

To all freshman women:

COOPERATION NEEDED!

It is obvious to all of us that
rushing has begun. This is a period
which tends to cause a great deal
of competition among the eight so-
rorities on campus. Inter-Sorority
Council has set up a code of rules
which pertain, not only to these
sororities, but also to the fresh-
men. We feel that these rulcs are
not being upheld. Therefore, we ask
you, the freshmen. to cooperate
with us in respecting these rules of
Inter-Sorority Council:

1. Observing quiet hours.

2. Not requesting favors
sorority members.

3. Visiting sorority houses only
upon invitation on (lays of their
rush parties only between the hours
of 3:00-5:00.

4. Following the
which are listed in
Handbooks.

We feel that with your help. we
can eliminate many of the reasons
for antagonism among sororities.

To the Editor:

We view with alarm the recent
trend in the quality of writing and
choice of subject matter for the
articles of the Slate (‘ollcge News.
In our opinion, the primary respon-
sibility of a college newspaper is

 

 

to present authoritative informa-
tion and stimulating analysis of
major problems. We wonder on
what Barbara Ilall bases her au-
thority on Communism. The “Com-
monStater” is a bad attempt at
sarcasm and often falls short of
being stimulating.

If the State College NcWS is the
trite voice of the student body, it
should reflect more of the academic
inquisitiveness and intellectual ma-
turity of those it represents. We
therefore offer our services to the
State (‘ollege News.

Sincerely,

Mr. Shakespeare Flops;
Tragedy Turns Travesfy

By BILL FRANKONIS

An Elizabethan audience had no
fear of voicing its dislike for a
play, and had Saturday night’s per-
formance of Othello been present-
ed for such an audience, we might
llcVCl‘ have known of the play to-
day. Of course, it might have
come down to us as a comedy.
but more likely, Othello by William
Shakespeare, would have been con-
signed to that limbo where turkey

go.

Saturday’s audience, being more
sophisticated (by years of social
pressure) than the groundlings of
the Bard‘s day. suffered in a rea-
sonable amount of embarrassed si-
lence M at least those who re-
mained past Act I did. True, the
extended siege of seat-squirming
was punctuated by sporadic erup-
tions of polite applause and uncer-
tain laughter, bttt squirming finally
triumphed: and a squirming audi~
ciice is obvioust l)ot‘(‘i.l. lloredo n

the audience to do more than just
Stl there, but in return. the drama

Othello, as Shakespeare wrote it. is
appealing. Slialu'speare was no-
l)t)tl_\"s fool. As part owner of flit‘

was to draw customers. because
many satisfied customers meant
much satisfying money. ('onse-

The modern tendency, howeel‘
is to play Shakespeare on a sophis~

is certain that Saturday's audi

Shakespeare's intended level: had
it been given the opportunity to do
so. (lranled, the audience witness»
ing Saturday's travesty of Othello
may not have been an cwcrienced,
theater-wise audience, but even an
inexperienced one will respond to
a tight knit, wcll-presenfed drama.

peare’s villians are among his best
characters. and to see Iago water-
