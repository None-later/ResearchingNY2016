Birch Society Tactics

By JOE GALU

The John Birch Society as re-
ported last week is a reactionary.
right wing organization. its mem-
bers are of a generally exceptional
nature.

The organization has two out-
standing tactics. ’l‘he first of these
is the use of the terms Pinko, Soft
on Communism. Communist. Dupe
of Communists and ultra-liberal.
Everyone who critizcs the organi—
Iation is dcnoiiuccd by the group
as being at least as “bad” as ati
ultra liberal and often the dcscnter
from Society littc is called a ('oiii-
iniinist

Examples of the above tactic iii-
clude when the president. who has
never been elected. Robert ll. W.
\t'clch called the Los Augclcs 'l'imes
an ultra liberal paper. The L. A.
Times is one of the most conserva-
tivc papers in America. Senator
Milton R. Young. Republican of
North Dakota. who has supported
the right wing by opposing the
censure of Senator Joseph Mc-
Carthy. and by opposing the Civil
Rights Commission. was called soft
on communism l'Ix-vice president
Nixon and Republican National
t'hairinan William Miller from
Lockport were called dupes. Ac-
cording to the John Birch Society
the nation‘s piiiko press group con-
tains the Daily Mirror. a national
('atholic magazuic called A vc
Maria. and the Catholic Archdio-
ccsc maga/incs from Boston ((‘ar-
dinal (‘ushing‘s The Pilot) and ('hi-
wiin v’l‘hc New World).

\n cutirc church has been label-
tcd piiiko This church is the l'nitcd
Presbyterian ('hurch. it does inat-
'ct‘ 'o ihc society whether you are
t i'l~t‘l'\.’tll\l' (right wing), middle
if the road or liberal tlcft Wing).
in the cy'cs of the society all who
are far to the left.

the other distasteful practice of
1b) Itirchiics is their use of Com-

oppose

munist tactics such as keeping lists
of their opponents and urging mem-
bers to spread rumors about peo-
ple they don't like.

According to an editorial printed
in an issue of this summer‘s New
York Daily Mirror  . . the so-
ciety's members and volunteers are
being asked to inform on their
neighbors. to make charges and ac-
cusations based on hearsay. per-
sonal venom. and spite."

'l‘hey fail to recognize that ac-
tions like urging members to writi-
anonymous letters about l)t't)tilc
they dislike are far more nirAincri
can than the income tax or the
maintaining of strong a r in e. d
forces.

The society's higgcst project of
this last spring aiul summer was
the extensive showing of the movie
“()pcration Abolition". This movie
has been condemned as inaccurate
and misleading by the New York
Times. the United Presbyterian
Church and the (iovcrnor of Michi-
gan. John Swainson. The society
blithely says that the errors are
minor and that the general mes
sage of the film is not altered by
these errors. ’l'hat statement by
the society is thc only one i have

heard them make which is coin-
plctcly true. The general message
of the film is therein revealed to

be dclibci‘atcly lltlsli'mllltii
