Now that the hunting season is
open (and whom are you taking to
the dorm formal?), many girls are
concentrating on tactics which will
make them alluring and irresist-
ible to members of the opposite
sex. In my fervent desire to help
the human race, here is a hunter’s
handy guide on how to shoot 'em
down.

a. HER: “Would you like to go to
the dorm formal next Saturday,
Filbert?"

HIM: “Why, yes, I’d love to!"

Dr. Adams
Addresses
Primer Staff

By GARY BELCAN

Last Tuesday evening, Dr. Theo-
dore S. Adams, Associate Profes-

sor of English, spoke at the
Primer meeting on the short

story. The purpose of the lecture
was to aid those who have at-
tempted to write short stories.

The meeting was held in Bob
Baker's apartment at 371 Hamilton
Street. A much larger crowd than
expected turned out to hear Dr.
Adams speak.

Dr. Adams began his speech by
referring to the audience several
books which we would find helpful
in understanding and writing the
short story. He also commented on
several short story writers, whom
he recommended to us.

He emphasized the fact that a
short story must have a beginning,
a middle and an end, and made a
distinction between the short story
and the vignette.

He gave numerous examples of
plots to avoid in a short story. He
explained the danger of ‘Ciich plot’
and ‘cliche phraseology’.

After the lecture the audience
had an opportunity to ask ques-

Alexandria Quartet as compared to
Proust’s works.

After the lecture the entire au-

The
Men tgm’nder

By ANNE DUGAN

HER: “Well, I hope you find a

date.”

b. HIM: “Gwendolyn, you're the
first girl I’ve met who is as in«
telligent as I am.”

HER: “I didn’t accept a date

with you to be insulted!"

c. HIM: “No one seems to under-
stand me except my dog.”
HER: “You are attractive to
dumb animals, aren’t you!”

(1. HIM: “Imogene, you're the nic-
est girl l’ve ever known.”
HER: “Oh, Conrad! Am Ireaily
nicer than your mother?"

e. IIIM: “iiildegardc, you r big
brown eyes are so beautiful."
HER: “MOOOOO.”

f. HIM: “i believe men should as-
sert themselves."

HER: “And boys . . .'?"

Other suggestions to follow in-
clude:

1. When he tries to kiss you good-
night, light a cigarette.

2. When you’re dancing with him,
wave to all of your friends.

3. Talk ibout one thing all even-
ing . . your wonderful sorority
sisters.

. t‘tiew bubble gum and snap it
during a movie.

5. “car three inch heels when he

is just  tall as you are.

6. Try to look as exotic and as se-
ductive as possible when you
date someone who looks as if he
belongs in Sunday Sciiooi.

For all those who follow these
suggestions faithfully. We have a
contest. A marvelous prize will be
awarded to the first girl who suc-
cessfully shoots down 20 men in
three weeks. Since she will be sit-
ting home on weekends, she will
be presented with a full subscrips

of the college year. We also may
add a goldfish to keep her com-
party.

As citizens of the world, we should be concerned that
people not only in our country, but everywhere, have an
opportunity for education. Through Campus Chest, we at
State are able to help make it possible for more students to

receive a college education.

The proceeds of the Campus Chest Drive are divided
1mong three organizations. The World University Service
receives about 40’; of the receipts. Your contributions en-
able the WUS to operate in free countries throughout the
world. They help both individuals and educational insti—

tutions after the people themselves
have made an attempt toward an
educational goal. Without this or-
ganization, thousands lcss in such
countries as india, ('hina. and Jap-
an would graduate from college.
