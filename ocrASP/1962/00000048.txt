A Rivalry Tradition

It is fatal to enter any war without the will to win it.
(Speech to the Republican National Convention, cited in
the Common-Stator, November 10, 1961).

So this was the reason for the tie. Or was it?

Never before in the history of State College has Rival—
ry ended without both a loser and a winner. We feel that
something has been lost this year.

Idealistically, we suppose, winning Rivalry is unim-
portant. We agree that fun, class unity, and school spirit
are the real purposes which Rivalry should accomplish.
However, a vague let-down feeling crept over many people,
not just freshmen and Sophomores, when they heard the
final announcement of Campus Night. One of State's trad-
itions has been broken.

We realize that there was nothing that could have
been done about the problem on Campus Night. However.
the tie was still a disappointment to many.

What was the real necessity of dividing the newspaper
points according to specific issues? If the newspapers.
which were respectively unified by a basic staff and gen-
eral attributes, can be divided in points, why not divide the
sing points according to each song? Or why not divide the
skit points? The skit is probably the event towards which
the greatest effort is put.

The more contests whose points may be divided, the
more likely a tie becomes. Let‘s return to awarding the
newspaper points in one lot.

The unequal point division was originally set up so
there would be no ties.

Let's try to avoid breaking State‘s traditions.

A New SA Organization

State College, as it continues to grow, will need a coun—
cil which would coordinate and air the opinions of each of
its many organizations.

Such a new student government organization has been
established at Colorado State College this year. Called the
Advisory Senate, it is composed of directors of all chartered
campus organizations and has a threefold purpose:

It will serve first as a pulse organization for
Student Association by voting to represent student
opinion on proposed . . . legislation. Secondly, it
will be able to initiate suggestions for presentation
to the Association. Thirdly, it will serve as a
means of communication between Student Asso-
ciation and each campus organization with em-
phasis on announcements, organizational mail,
and scheduling of events.

In order to make such a group at State effective, more
than three absences would have to lead to loss of member-
ship. It seems doubtful that organizations would want to
lose their voices in student government.

Meetings could be held approximately every three
weeks; discussion on the floor could be limited. Since an
Advisory Senate composed of the heads of all campus or-
ganizations would have such a large membership, per—
haps an executive committee for the advisory board could
be elected to coordinate the group policies after issues had
been discussed and each group had submitted a written
opinion.

Although our governmental agencies may be some-
what inadequate at present, they will necessarily become
more and more inadequate as the school population doubles
in the next ten years. Only by planning for these changes
now can we assure that students at State College will con-
tinue to have the benefits of the most effective govern-
ment possible.

To the Editor:

In order to squelch any possible
rumors or false stories which
might circulate among the student
body as to my actions or their mo-
tives, I am writing this note to the
News.

I do hereby resign, as of this
date, November 14, 1961, from my
formal affiliation with the Edward
Eldred Potter Club.

This move upon my part is in
no way motivated by any ill will
between myself and the members
of the Club; but is, rather, solely
prompted by reasons and pressures
being brought to bear upon myself
from sources without the organi-
zation and the college. I can not
emphasize this point. too strongly.

Words can not express the regret
I feel in making this decision. I
have. and shall continue to have.
nothing but the greatest warmth
and affection for my many friends
in I’otlcr Club.

Edward Brennan '62
To the Editor:

In regard to the articles on (“our
munisni, I will enumerate my ex»
pericnccs and sources upon which
I based my material and authority.

:\t Pomona College in 1957, a
Dr. Chen, one of my professors.
escaped from Red China and ex»
plained and clarified questions on
why the Communists were prevail-
ing there.

For the past eight weeks, I)r.
(terald II. Nolting of St. Pauli»
Episcopal Church in Schenectady,
has been lecturing on the Commu-
nists and their cause. He has been
to ’iiissia and is originally from
Germany.

My other sources of informa-
tion include: The Communist .Ilani-
lesto, The Capital, .I. E. IIoover's
Masters of Deceit, and Robert
IIunt‘s The Theory and Practice of
Communism.

Barbara Hall ’62
To the Editor:

Last weekend radio stations and
newspapers in the area followed
their custom of making an over-
production of activities of State
students. I feel that our students
have a right to know what hap~
pencd on the Outing Club trip to
the Adirondacks.

A group of 15 students attempted
to climb .\It. Marcy, A group that
decided to take an alternate route
did not have enough time to make
it out of the woods in the daylight.
Instead of wandering aimlesst ill
the woods, they made camp for the
night and came out tired but uii»
harmed. They had with them adc
qiiatc equipment to keep them for
their entire stay in the woods.

This small group got a large
spread in the papers and on the
radio with much of the information
incorrect, llt)\‘.t'\l'l'. llll' group that
placed an Albany State banner on
the summit of Mt. Marcy, highest
point in lllt‘ state. was not ('\(‘ll

Who would you like as your
r o o m m a t e next year'.’ This
question may seem untimely, and
yet we may consider it appropriate
at the present time.

I‘Iach one of us is probably
aware of the fact that Thanks-
giving vacation is very near. This
period of socializing at home.
meeting old friends now in college
or high school, can easily prove
a major factor in the type and
calibre of students who apply and
enroll at our college next year.

L'njustified Criticism

In group discussions, one of the
favorite and most frequent topics
is that of the quality of our col-
tcgc. Students seem to be more
willing to criticize our college
community and its inhabitants than
defend it. Certainly, if these same
attitudes ari- t)l)\ ions in discussions
with students from othcr colleges
and lIIL‘ll st'lliliils, how can we ex-
pect these people to respect or
consider attending our school"

of our students and faculty is of
definite significance, and although
the enrollment at State College is
not as large as that of some other
schools, it is important to remem-
ber that quality is of greater sig‘
nificancc than quantity.

’I‘his 'l‘hanksgiving vacation may
prove to be of great value if stu-
dents are willing to make known
the virtues of our college, and ap-
pear enthusiastic about our campus
life.

Significant Features

Some of the significant features
to remember are that State Col-
lege will no longer be considered
a 'I‘cacliers‘ College next year.
Rather. students will be able to en-
roll in a liberal arts program. Also,
State College does have many so-
cial iiil\antzigcs which are not dif-
ficult to liiid or cypericnce.

The most influential recruiters
of new college material are the
college students themselves This
new material may be favorable or
‘ unfavorable", (Ii-pending upon the
facts and attitudes to which they
.irc exposed

Student Role

i‘omrury to public opinion. it is
not only the Admissions Depart-
ment who determines the students
who enroll each year. It is imr
portant to rcmcmbcr that if a stu-
dent docs iiol apply at our college,
this department cannot select or
reject him.

'l‘hcrcl'orc. it is important that iii-
stead of being apologetic and ap-
athetic towards our school. we
should all “stand up and be
counted" with the best.
