The Un-Americans

By JOE GALU

This is nothing but a long list of
dry, startling, well -documented
facts about the House Uri-American
Activities Committee, which here-
after will be referred to as the
IIUAC.

The committee was established
23 years ago as a temporary in-
vestigating organization. As 0
Wednesday night, when this \as
written. IIUAC had not produced a
single law. Not one of the laws re-

——.

.sti'icting Communism has been
based on information discovered

or collected by IIUAC.

On January 2, 1961, members of
the American Nazi Party picketed
in front of the White House in sup-
port of HUAC.

Publications And Effects

Recently the committee has be-
gun publishing, on an annual basis.
a list of all the people it subpoenaed
during the year. Nantes of ‘friend~
ly witnesses' are deleted. In Janu-
ary of this year, John II. Farmer,
with Bible and shot gun, forced his
way into the office of University of
California Professor Thomas Park-
inson. He shot and killed one of
Parkinson‘s associates and wound-
ed the professor. Farmer admits
not knowing either man, but he
stated he saw their names on one
of the above mentioned lists.

The first chief investigator for
the IIUAC was both a professional
labor spy and a publicity agent for
native Fascist groups. His name is
Edward I”, Sullivan.

KKK Support

James ('olescott, the Ku Klux
Klan Imperial Wizard, stated sev»
cral years ago that the commit-
tcc’s “program so closely parallels
the program of the Klan that there
is no distinguishable difference be-
tween them."

Liberals and moderates have de-
manded investigations of Fascist
groups in America. In 1945 under
(‘hairman \‘eldc, an investigation
of two small hate groups was an
nounccd, .\'o witnesses were called:
a report was issued. In 1947 the
committee began another investiga-

tion of the radical right. Rep. John

sub-committee. Its hearing and
meeting lasted a total of ten min
utes. Since then no investigation of
the radical right has been conduct-
ed despite the bombings of schools.

Judge Of Noses

John Rankin, a former member
of the Il[.'AC, sponsored a bill to
keep (I.I.’s from voting. A group of
women demonstrated against the
bill, which was defeated. In refer-
ence to the women Rankin stated:
“If I am any judge, they are com-
munists . . They looked like for-
eigners to me. I never saw such a
wilderness of noses in all my life.

UN Conference Delegates
Hear Eminent Statesmen

By KURT SYDOW

Members of the Forum of Poli-
tics and Student Government who
attended the (‘t‘UX Conference for
Student Leaders in New York City
last weekend, November 10-11, had
a chance to hear the positions of
various governments on world
problems.

Delegates heard speeches by In-

dian l’rinic .\Iinistcr .Iauahai‘lal
.\'chru. .\lr. l'saghev of the
USS II. and Senator Joseph S.

(dark from Pennsylvania.

.\Ir. .\’chru‘s speech on .\'ovember
11, was the highlight of the con-
ference. In his speech be impressed
most delegates with his great lut-
inility and quiet wisdom. He told
the students, "We must face the
problem of how to avoid war . .
Your generation must face that
more than mine.”

He spoke of the great gap that
separates our great technological
advances and our moral and poli-
tical thinking, and said that we
must bridge this gap or else the
war after next “will be fought with
bows and arrows.”

In the question-and-answer pe-
riod following the speech, Mr. Nch~
ru answered questions on such
subjects as the role of non-
aligned nations in the world, uni-

lateral disarmament, and the fu-
ture role of the United Nations.

.\Ir. Usaghev expressed the Rus-
sian point of view on the world sit-
uation. He spoke of the destruc-
tion of a nuclear war and urged a
disarmament treaty. Ile said the
Soviet l'nion is condiicting atmos-
pheric tests because “our country
was compelled to take some meas-
ures to better defend ourselves.”

A lively question period with
very pointed questions followed. In
cnswcr to one question on why the
ISSR. has not contributed to the
l'..\'. t‘ongo forces. .\Ir. Usashcv
replied it was because "We don’t
believe in force."

The I'nited Statcs’ position on
disarmament was spelled out for
delegates by Senator Joseph S.
Clark. Ile stated: “In my opinion,
our proposal for a nuclear test
ban is reasonable.” Like Mr.
.\'ehru, he too spoke of the great
lag between technology and poli-
tical thinking.

The conference was attended by
more than 1,600 delegates from 44
states. Members of our delegation
had a chance to talk with students
from such places as Little Rock,
Arkansas and Les Angeles, Calif-
ornia.

The
Meat tgrzinder

By ANNE DUGAN

decided that they would like to
correct our class term papers
after vacation (only our vacation
will be wrecked, you see).

I have de ‘ldt‘tl to take my laun-
dry ltome, and at this point, it
will surely take a (lay of soapsuds
and Clorox to restore it to its Sep-
tember state.

Instead of reading a few choice
paperbacks, comic books, or Mac]
magazines, I have found that I will
be textbook toting on the train iii-
stead of reading Ilenry Miller, as
I had planned.

Since I do realize the necessity
of accomplishing something over
vacation ('2), I have marvelous
ambitions for all kinds of things
which will never get done. At
this point, I really have good in-
tentions, however. That means
I can begin to rationalize around
Sunday.

During

the weekend, we will

all begin to frequently repeat,
“Why exert. ourselves for two

whole days of classes?” After all,
why knock yourself out to do any-
thing you can put off until later?
On Monday, the vacation spirit
will account for everything we
don‘t do, and on ’I‘uesday,.,well,
that‘s almost as got d as 'l‘hanks-
giving itself. (. . . And let us give

thanks for our wonderful hang-
overs)
(tther than making us appear

\cry studious to our parents. the
books we will take home will pro-b-
ably oiin take up suitcase room.
The problem of the whole matter
lies in having a big fling with-
out having a guilty conscience.

Think of how much would be
solved if all libraries Look a four
day holiday and barred their
doors; no one Would feel bad if
force were applied to keep us from
our books. Do write your Congress-
man—when you have lots of time
