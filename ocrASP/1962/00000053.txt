The Peace Corps, since its be-
ginning, has received compliments
and criticism. However, before the
existence of such a program can
be regarded as “good” or "bad,"
it must have time to prove itself.

The spirit of the program seems
to revolve around the statement
made by President Kennedy in his
inaugural address: “Ask not what
your country can do for you, ask
what you can do for your coun-
try.” It purposes to make avail-
able a pool of trained manpower
to help other countries meet ur-
gent needs. whilc achieving the
goal  understanding and trust
that arise from common effort."

Although the goals set forth by
the Peace Corps program may
seem too ideal to insure any suc-
cess. its originators, leaders and
workers felt otherwise. As one
volunteer stated, “. .We are not
(levvcy-eycd, young zealots, as
some people have called us, out to
save the world . We want to
be more than ambassadors of good
will. We want to do the job they
(the host countries) are asking us
to do and as a by-product of doing
that job, we want to create an
image of America.

Peace Corps is Permanent

A “pilot” program originally
established by executive order
from President Kennedy in March,
1961. was finally made permanent
by legislation on Sept. 21, 1961.

The Bill authorized appoint-
ments subject to Senate confir-
nation ol' a Peace Corps director
at an annual salary of $20,000 and
a deputy director at $19,500 per
year. it ptit the Corps under the
policy direction of supervision of
the State Secretary and author-
ized a “termination” pay of $125
per month for volunteer leaders
and $75 per month for Volunteers.
it also provided that volunteers
swear that they do not advocate
the overthrow of the government,
nor knowingly belong to any or-
ganization which does.

370 Volunteers Serve

the director, Robert Sargent
Slirivcr estimates that at the pres-
ent time 370 Peace Corps voltm-
teers are serving abroad and 375
more are in training. Two-thirds
are serving in the capacity of
teachers, one-sixth are serving on
agricultural and community dc-
velopments and one-sixth on health
and engineering. it is expected
that by .ltiiie. liltiL’. there will be
l.tiott volunteers abroad.

The Peace Corps will serve
wherever a nation seeks it, and
ll will not extend a project into any
country where it has itot been
specifically invited.

The Corps mid the Government

The Corps is now a semi-aut-
oiiomous agency within the Depart-
ment of State tiperations are
subject to (‘titil‘tllliltlltitl and super-

Peace Corps Is Example

It is hoped by supporters ot the
program that the Peace Corps will
set an example for other nations
who vvill then make their own
efforts to increase the welfare of
all men and to improve under»
