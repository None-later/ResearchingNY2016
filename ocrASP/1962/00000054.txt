So what was so good about the
radiation-tree “Good Old Days.”
Get this little gem from the Sept.
19, 1917 News. The regulation gyim
costume is as follows:

Black bloomers

White middy (no colored colors)

Black tie

Black stockings

White sneakers (high or low)

State enjoyed one of its finest
baskettball seasons’ ever in 1934-
35, compiling a 5M record, and
beating RPI 33-132 in the first bas-
keitball game eyer played betwom
the Feds and our playmates to
the north . . , State had a swing-
ing chess team back in 1940, win-
ning seiven straight meets, includ-
ing a 3-2 affair at the expense
of West Point. It was a black day
for the Black Knights in the game
of knights. Contrary to current be-
lief the football game played be-
tween EEP and RI’I two weeks
ago was not the first time a State
frat has ventured out from the
home grid league to oppose an-
other School. In 19-16 SLS tried it,
with less success that greeted Pot-
ter, losing to Sicna 3H). . . . 1931
Rivalry basketball game was a
close, action—packed “contest,” the
Sophs coming from behind to win
23—1.

HATS OFF TO JOE
Although the snow is starting to fall and indoor
sports are getting the call, (who said that sports writers
would never make good poets?) we would like to boot ye
ol’ soccerball around a little more before we deflate it and

. set it back on the equipment room shelf. Most of us know
that we really had one heck of a soccer season this year.

It was a tremendous team effort and we believe that much
credit is due to the man who molded our forces into such
a well coordinated unit. Whether he was hamming it up at
the. Homecoming bonfire rally, on TV, or along the side-
lines, or just giving one of his patented pro-game pep
talks, he bubbled with the type of energy, spirit, and en-

thusiasm that can set a team on fire.

This is a statistic

that cannot be put in the books, yet how many times
might it have been that little spark that measured the
difference between victory and defeat? We had excellent
players, but even the best teams need that something or
someone to get them ready psychologically to win. We had
that someone who may have made the difference between
a good and an excellent record. So here’s a tip of th fedora
to Joe Garcia for a tremendous soccer season.
SPEAKING OF BASKETBALL!!!

As we weren’t . . . How‘s this for a scoop? On Decem-
ber 2, 1955 the then recently acquired basketball coach,
Dick Sauers, directed his first State basketball win against
a squad from New Paltz. Now, six years, 98 more wins.
and a Doctorate degree later, he may coach his 10th vic-
tory. The date?——this Saturday, December 2, The team?"

——you guessed it, New Paltz! !!

JENKS’ JUNK

Bad news —— Clem Crow,

star of last year's wrestling

squad, celebrated Thanksgiving by busting his ankle. We
are not sure how bad the injury is, but it can't be too bad
since rumor has it that he has been spending his nights
dancing in the Bru game room. . . . Our soccer team placed
three men on the Conference All—Star teams: Karl Heinz
Gerstenberger and Franz Zwicklebauer made the first
team; Erwin Seimon, the second. . . . We understand the
frosh men have been enjoying their gym classes. Nothing
like a good brisk walk to the bulletin board twice a week

The 1961-1962 version of Albany State basketball will
launch its season tomorrow night at the New Paltz High
School gym. Last year, the hoopsters, under the direction
of Coach Dick Sauers, compiled a fine 21-7 overall record.
The team, greatly hurt by the loss of co-captains Don

State for the first time will play all but one of its
home games on the spacious Washington Avenue Armory
court. This will provide much more comfort for the spec—

Coach Sauers stated that his probable starting line-

Wallace and Weeks whom he stated, “work
better together than any other unit I have.
stated that Roger Casey, who reported late suffering from
a shoulder injury, would see plenty of action.
