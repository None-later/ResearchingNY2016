English Majm Agenda Includes Football,
Dippikil|,Summit Meeting

By Fran Harris

Each English major should
make an appointment with his ad-
visor in advance to ensure a full
discussion of courses for next
semester. This conference should
take place at least a day before
pro-registering.

Since some of the courses which
Dr. Fred B. Millctt, distinguished
visiting Professor of English, will
be teaching Spring semester are
not listed in the college catalogue
as available this year, the State
College News is listing the titles
and descriptions so that students
may consider them at the time of
pre-regislration.

EN 136 (Sponsored by the Coin-
parative Literature and English
Departments; suitable for Human-
ities credit). Introduction to the
Principles and Traditions of Lit-
erary Criticism: the Nineteenth
and TvVCiIIit‘lll Centuries. The
sources of m o d c r n criticism:
romantic, realistic, and Marxist
criticism; current developments in
critical theory. While the course
will concern itself primarily with
the various theories of criticism,
some attention will be given to
applied or practical criticism. 'l‘wo
credits. Mondays and ’l‘hursdays
at 12:00.

EN 271A Senior English Sem-
inar (A full semester course sim-
ilar in method and approach to the
eight-week course for Student
’I‘cachers.) The theory and practice
of the intensive analysis of Lit-
erature. Examples will be chosen
from the poetry and fiction of
various literary periods. The rela-
tions between intensive analysis
and critical exaluation will be iii-
vcstigatt d. \loiiday 'l‘ucsdavs.
and Thursdays at 1:00. '

EN 198 Junior Honors in Eng-
lisii ()pcn only to English Majors
wiio have been adn‘itlcd to thc
pi‘ograiii.

Committees Report
Members of the service com-
mittee have seen Dean 'I‘horiie
about the proposed study lounge,
which Chairman Dick Kelley ex-
pects vvil be set up before Christ-
mas. ’l‘lie cafeteria will remain
open later now, and will be clean-
ed from 'J to -I p.ni. The possibility
of conducting fire drills in the
class buildings is also being ex-
amined.
Banner
Senator Kelly further reported
there are five possible companies
from which a new State College
banner may be obtained. Design
for the banner are being planned.
The banner is expected to cost
between $50 and $60 if it is pur—
chased; the lowest bid currently
received is $54.50.
Elections Committee
Elections Committee, who have
been checking the SA Constitution,
report there are from eight to 10
places where the present constitu-
tion could be improved, including
changing the name of the College,
where it is mention in the Consti-
tution.
Summit Conference
’l‘eiitatively, the Summit Confer-
ence will be held next Wednesday
in place of the regular Senate
meeting. Senator Knapp suggested
that the presidents of WC and [SC
be at the conference to participate
in discussion of the role of sorori-
ties and fraternitie». on the new
Cllllliills'
Football May Improve Teachers
Several Senators want steps
iakeii to institute a football team
at State
It was also suggested that any
rumors concerning the new cam-

pus be cleared up at the confer-
ence.

Senate will try to learn about
plans and facilities for and receive
suggestions concerning the type of
student government we should
have on the new campus.

Camp Board

Camp Board’s Dippikill building
plans highlighted the remainder of
the meeting. Senator Alden Pierce,
a member of Camp Board, rc-
minded Senate of the proposed
plans for a Dippikill lodge and
facility improvements which the
board presented to Senate to Sen-
ate at the November 8th meeting.

Camp Board would be presently
handicapped in taking any definite
action right now without a vote of
approval from Senate of the plans

presented up to now. Senator
Pierce suggested that forward,
concrete action could be taken

with Senate approval.

Bill Leo asked Senator Pierce
if We couldn‘t get a definite bid
before anything is decided, but
it was explained that a definite
bid hasn't been accepted before
this because there has been no
Senate-approved plan to receive
definite bids. Senator Pierce was
asked if approval of this plan
now would bind Senate financially
in the future. Senator Pierce
stressed that the only issue con-
cerned is approval of the building
plans as they now stand so that
Dippikill expansion won‘t be stale-
matcd any longer; Senate will not
be financially bound.

Senate voted to approve Camp
Board‘s building plans.

It was su‘gestcd that Dippikill
expansmn plans be discussed at
the Summit Conference.
