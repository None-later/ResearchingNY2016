As we all know, vacations are
never long enough. so I took the
liberty of taking an extra week off
from my “creative” duties (they
won't let me type llouse I‘Iowls

thinking time again, what better
thing can one put his mind to than
our next vacation? Do you all want

This week the observers take our
pens in grubby little fists, and look
desperately for cigarettes since
the latest addition has also run out.

While we were sitting in the
Commons today, we noticed that
someone had displaced the “tree

preciate the attempt to bury it un-

shopping early; here are some
helpful hints on how to accomplish
this feat.

Mothers generally give you lists.
They want all kinds of goodies, but
its very distressing to pick out
things like flannel nightgowns and
("hinese knicknacks. Our taste in
sleepwear is rather thwarted by
dormitory living. and we prefer
beer mugs to any knicknacks, so
we just can't win anyway.

We all should know that you
can't biiy fathers anything. They
don't want anything. BU’I‘ . . . if
you don't give them anything. they
become very hurt. Solution: give
them something to eat. If they
don‘t like it, someone in your fain-
ily will take it.

Roommates aren't hard to buy
gifts for. Your best bet ‘s' a cloth-
ing sale. Pick out sor c‘ning you
both like and need am he sure to
try it on. Most true-blue room-
mates will do do same when
choosing your gift. and if you're
displeased, you can always trade
Another idea give a good re-
view book in a course you're both

State He -

Special Sessions Shown As
Political Field Day For Rocky

By JOE GALU

This article will discuss the sev-
eral facets of the new reapportion-
mcnl law concerning congressional
districts. Before the districts
themselves are viewed, it is most
reasonable that the conditions un—
der which they Were created be
examined.

Constitution Quoted

The state constitution in article
l\', section three, states: “lie [the
governor] shall have the power to
convene the legislature, or the sen-
ate only, on extraordinary occa-
sions. At extraordinary sessions no
subject shall be acted upon, ex-
cept such as the governor may rec-
ommend for consideration."

In article lll, section fourteen,
the constitution includes a provi-
sion stating that the state senators
and asscinblyiiicn must have ac-
cess to all bills at least three days
before their final passage. This
applies to all cases except when
the governor in writing and with
the seal of the state decides that
an immediate vote is necessary.

Purpose Of A Special Session

Let us not be naive. 'l'hc Repub—
lican party of this state is you-
trolled by Governor Rockefeller,
State t‘hairman l.. Judson Mor-
housc and Senate Majority lnader
\l'altcr .l .\lalioney. ’I‘bey exercise
the same control as a l)eSapio,
Ilitcklcy \lclx’inncy or l’rendcr-
gast.

In special sessions some niem»
'ers are almost always absent.
this was the case on November
seventh and eighth. ’l'hc constitu»
iion requires that its assemblymcn
and Ill! senators vote for a bill in
order for it to become a law. It
is more difficult to get this major-
ity iii a special session since he-
causc more members are absent,
but in a special session the spot-
light is on. Every senator or as-
seinblyman who fails to vote party
Iiiie is in an extra spotlight. This
extra beam of light fell on fiie as
scniblynien in the last special ses-
sion All five voted against the
new reapportionnu'ul plan; all five
are from counties which were iuov-
ed from one congressman‘s district
to another. It Will be interesting to
see if the five assemblynicn, lion~

scpli I‘Igan, Schenectady; .lcrry
lllack, Schuyler; t‘liarlcs IIcndci‘»
son, Steuben; and l'aul ’l‘aylor,
Yates, are renonunatcd by their
party

Set Time Period

When a special session is called
by the governor, he will state how
long it should last Lawmakers
will think at least twice before
forcing it to last longer than the
allotted period of time 'l'bc result
is a "take or leave" situation.

Four Districts For Queens

The four districts in this rapidly
growing county have been reshuf-
fled. All four have larger than av-
erage populations. As in Westches-
ter, this is unfortunate because
the area is largely suburban and
is growing in population. When it
is next time to reapportion the
congressional districts. it will be
1971. At that time there is no teU-
ing how many people will be living
in the suburban counties.
