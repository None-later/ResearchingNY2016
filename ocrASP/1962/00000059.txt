Visits Primer

By Andy Neiderman and Bob Baker

All the literary novitiate are
invited to participate in the Primer
meeting. Tuesday. December 12.
8:00 pm. 371 Hamilton Street
(below Lark). Mr. Arthur Collins
will discuss and catechize Primer
poetry. past - present - future. Mr.
Collins will read from an article
which he contributed to the Pen-
guin an attempt in 1957 to sup-
plant the Primer.

'l‘here will be two issues of the
Primer this year. The deadline
for the manuscripts submitted for
the first issue is January 10th.
The object of these informal fa-
culty talks is to acquaint the stu-
dent body with the organization.
We feel there are too many stu-
dents who do not know what the
Primer is. or even that there is a
literary magazine on campus.

The major problem the Primer
faces is how to put out two issues
with a one issue budget. Almost
all the other State Universities
put out qnarterlics. ()neonta. an
obscure mountain school has tWo

grand alloted. We are alloted
about half that sum and our
school‘s enrollment doubles ()ne-
