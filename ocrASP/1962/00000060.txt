As members of the State College

of llt‘C~lSC in selling bids for Win-

A sincere attempt was made last
year. but at least one very impor-
tant person felt that a Chanukah
wreath had no place in a room with
a Christmas tree. No doubt this is
faulty and selfish reasoning, but
nevertheless. even small celebra-
tions had to be held privately by
those who realized that December
has more. to it than the Christmas
season.
