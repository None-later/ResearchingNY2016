KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK

We feel that much credit is due to a certain group on
our dear 01‘ Campus for the support they have been giving
our basketball forces. Ask any one who has ever played on
the team and he will tell you that there is nothing like
coming off the court and seeing lots of people you know
in the stands, especially at away games Usually. the only.
cheers heard at away games are from the opposing tcain‘s
rooters, but such was not the case at Oneonta. The so oi

In Initia/ Meet With Cort/and

The 1961-1962 wrestling season began this past Satur-
day w1th a match against Cortland State. Both the Varsity
and the Freshmen wrestlers lost by scores of 37-3 and 36—0.
respectively. These scores do not, however, represent the
full story of the contest. Many matches were close as they
were only lost by a few points.
