Senate Backs Protest;
Kelly to Head March

By ANNE SMITH

A demonstration against the institution of tuition in
the State College system will take place in front of the
State Capitol building this Monday eventing. Richard

Kelly ’63 is in charge of

this protest. All members

of the student body are urged to participate in this
demonstration. Assembly will take place at 6:30 p.m. on
Dorm Field and students are urged to group together quiet-
ly and orderly. Posters are requested and the following
slogans are to be used: “Don’t take our education from
us:" “Give us a chance to teach;” “Tuition or teachers?”
and “No tuition!” These slogans will be maintained in order
to assure uniformity. All posters should be mounted on

stiiks and must be on white paper
with black lettering. Any other
slogans must have the llllpl'IH'LI of
a committee member before use.
There will be no excuse for cut-
ting classes to work on posters or
to plan the demonstration iii any
way.

Students are requested to dress
warmly and to assemble quietly
on Dorm Field at the requested
time so that group captains can
give instructions to those assent-
bled. Students will titarcli behind
their class banners and are asked
to group with their class upon ar-
rival at the field. Participants
should plan on spending two or
three hours demonstrating and
they are asked to plan their time
accordingly so they will be able to
take part.

Senate has sent telegrams to all
State schools asking them to stage
similar demonstrations at the
same time as ours. They are also
sending form letters to each
parent requesting them to write
their (‘ongressional representatives
to sceke political agitation.

Yesterday l’rcsideii‘, (‘ollins was

ic) What guarantce do we have
that tuition would not be subject to

S'I‘l'lH'INT OPINION GIVEN

An extensive open d. 'ussion of
student opinion followed. The fol-
lowing ptints were brought re-
garding student action:

'l'here is a crying need for teach-
ers 011 a national level. The in-
crease in cost lessens the at-
tractiveness of teaching to poten-
tial teachers

Parents should write letters to
their representatives asking them
to support action which would re-
voke the 'l‘rustces‘ power to levy
tuition.

’l‘hct‘c is no guarantee that tui-
tion will go to individual schools.
11' this is to bring an “enrichment”
in the cultural atmosphere of the
school. the added tuition would
hinder students from going to col-
lege to attain this added culture.
ltliMUNS’I‘RA'I‘ION NECESSARY

A dcinoiislration is necessary to
show the seriousness of our feel-
lliEfS in llllS inatti-i'. However it
should be iloiie iii a “prudent”
manner This action. if taken,
should itot be written off by the
press as "pro examination iittcrs."

Albany State has been called

dical faculty aitd a conservative

itlty support Why not let them

help us'.’
