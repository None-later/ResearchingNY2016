lioroi‘t's iil'lii‘li' ill the Saturday Review. “Albany State: A
'i‘cachcr‘s Ctillt'gc in 'i‘i'ansition.” Many are asking ques—
tions "Why did Boroi'i' sclcct Albany State for his articles?"
"Wlicn did lit‘ visit and how how long did he stay to inter-
view llil‘ students and faculty)" “Which students and fac—
ulty did he iiitcrvtt-w'" Also. “What basis did Borof‘f have
for lhc opinions Wliii'll iic cxprcsscd so lavishly?"
