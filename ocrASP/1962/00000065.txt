The city of Newburgh has been
in the news for almost a year. Be-
fore considering the situation of
relief, l would like to survey part
of Newburgh's history.

D u ri n g the nineteen-twenties
Newburgh was the shopping center
for the area around it. During the
depression it became even more a
center due to the fact that public
transport connected it with its out
skirts.

Immediately after the war many
shopping centers were built. They
were built in areas near the city
such as Middleton. Westchester
and North Rockland. With the ar-
rival of a car in every carport and
breezeway. Newburghers began
shopping outside the city. The peo-
ple who once rode buses into New-
bnrgh now drive their cars to the
nearest bargain paradise

The people who live in Newburgh
have fought a long. bloody and
successful battle against any and
all industries trying to enter the
city of Newburgh and the town of
Newburgh. lnternational Business
Machine attempted to build a plant
in the outskirts of Newburgh. The
plant is located in Poughkeepsic
Newburgh has seen no new indus«
try of any size since 1929.

The city's business was upper
class. It lost this trade as soon as
the rationing of gasoline was stop-
ped. Many major businesses have
closed due to lack of high class
business and the inability of the
lower classes to carry the number
of businesses in the city. The popu-
lation of Newburgh has not grown
much between 1900 and 1960. The
meaning of this is that with upper
people buying outside of
New-burgh there is less business in
the city.

The majority of people now liv-
ing in the slums of Newburgh are
Negroes and l’uerto Ricans. The
area where these people live has
been a slum for some time.

The main slum area is around
Water Street. Most of the small
stores in the area were opened by

"farm

people who lived in the baclt
of the store or above the store.
.\'ow the owners no longer live

above the stores. The apartments
have been rented to Negroes. The
older groups no longer shop in this
area. The older group members
who have been able have moved
from Ncwburgh. The result has
been large lower and ltt\\’t'l"|lll(l(il(‘
classes

Industry is not dead in New-
burgh. lint it is not thriving. 'l'hcrc
is one field of occupation which is
still going strong in the city. This
field is medicine. .\'cwburgh is
still the center of its area in this
one respect Specialists of all sorts
have officcs in Newburgh.

’l‘he zoning latvs of Ncwburgh are
such that \irtually all doctors' of

ficcs arc in areas whcrc they
should not be The city has the
power to fine each doctor $20 a

day for each day an office remains
in the wrong part of the city. 'l'hc
law has been in cffcct for 2:3 years
This works out to a fine of approx

iiiiatcly $005300 00 lor cach doctor

STATE COLLEGE NEWS. FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1962

 

1n everyone's home town. there
is the type of boy who is consid-
ered “perfect for the friend you

bring home for semester break.
’. h.s type of boy is "a good
sale date." and he's not the

type who is so terribly slow he
doesn't know whether he's afoot or
horseback; but on the other hand,
you want to be sure he won't at-
tempt to engulf your poor friend

with his all too avid attention.
It may sound strange, but. this
"safe" type is pretty hard to find
——especially during semester va-
cation.

’l‘wo weeks before we went
home, I wrote letters trying to

prepare everyone for the task of
locating a date for one of State's
own "shorthaircd, opcirfacid"
variety. t“ , I certainly Would

love to go out with you, Charlie,
but . do you have any nice
friends ‘.’ ‘.’ 1’ "1

When I arrived home. all friends
and friends of friends were quite
unavailable. and we were faced
with the problem of finding some-
one—anyone. ()ut came the old
high school yearbook, and it's
shocking to behold what inconven-
iences the Army and marriage
have caused.

Parents are no help at all in
a situation like this. "You find her
a nice date or else . . . 
they whisper. "Or else . , What“"

, or else you stay home!"

Then the friend starts, "'l‘hat's
t).l\'. I‘ll stay home 1 can watch
'l‘.\'. with your parents. I'm just

dowdy and plain . . . .

Finally. at six on Saturday night
we found one. He was a "safe"

in fact he even asked out
"friend" 'dﬂilill—~\\'illllllll being
told to do it! So you see. State
girls are more than bovine milk
inaids.——~e\'en though they cause
their “dowdy air! plain" girl-
friends to watch TV with their
parents while they tersc off to

see "The Kitchen“ with the “per

Touching All

This is probably not an unfamiliar tune with a lot of
us here at State. We may suddenly find our pockets empty.
or cleverly notice that we have no money in the bank to
cover this semester‘s room and board. or maybe we get the
word from the parents back home. in any case several of us
must face the need of finding work (Ughlli Such is thc
case with several members of our current basketball squad
They are no better off than we are. they don't get full cx-
pense athletic scholarships with fifty dollars a month laun
dry money. a new Caddy. and $10,000 a year jobs for their
fathers and brothers.

In fact these players are worse off than Wl‘ arc since
most of the worthwhile part time jobs which are availablc
occupy the afternoon hours during which our boys arc
running up and down the Armory court preparing for their
next encounter.

Also, they must save their nights for studying. You
don't have to look at the Saturday Review to discover that
Albany State doesn't offcr such courses as Sandbox ‘21:,
Basketwcaving 121. Girl Watching 7, Twisting 06. oi
Mumblcty—peg officiating 3. «l. and :3 which would allow
athletes to back their way throuin collcgc

Too many of our students. faculty. and adininistra
tion take these men for granted They are doing a job lit‘t'c
at our H21l‘Vﬂl‘Ci-(lIi-th("-HthlSt)h. Besides the fact that thcv
present a form of entertainment and enjoyment for local
as well as student sports fans. they are advvrtising our
college. The more a college‘s name is heard of. in the sports
page or clscwherc. the more likely people are to 1'1‘11lt‘ll1
her it.

We feel that the college would be performing it much
needed favor if they could make jobs availablc to ilicsc
men. These jobs would have to be availablc during 111"
players' frcc periods. and could possibly be of such a nature
as library or office work. custodial or inaiiitcnancc work
supervision of gym classes or the like.

We believe that finding these jobs is almost an obligii
tion to these men who have put in long hours of practicc
and play to represent. our school. and we hope that. stint"
thing can and will be done.
