Fraternity Recognized
'I'heta Xi Omega was fully recog-
nized as a State College fraternity
and their probationary period of
one year was terminated at the
tl"(‘ meeting of February 7.
Folk Singing
Mr. Richard Wilkie will enter-
tain the guests of the Primer mag-
azine next Tuesday. February 13.
at 8:30 p.m. in llrubaeher hall
private dining room with a formid-
able display of folk singing.
.\lr Wilkie has entertained his
clltss‘cS and other local groups since
residing in the Albany area.

 

’l‘eachers should know how lotto
many things. One of the most im—
portant thing we are able to learn
at State is how to take our future
classroom charges on a field trip
to the State Education Museum.

We are first taught to know a
litle about the place we intend to
visit. This is so we will know
more than the kids when the group
gets there. We are also requested
to case the joint to note any dan-
gerous spots where "little Johnny"
may push "little Susie" causing
her to fall down twenty or thirty
flights of stairs. Such playful
activity is definitely frowned upon.

All children must have permis-
sion blanks before they can be al-
lowed to go on the trip. This en-
tails days of collecting all kinds
of grubby slips of paper, half of
which are probably forged because
the kid forgot to get it signed on
time.

phlets of the building and explain
the hazards which exist within (or
withouti. (“We must be careful.
kiddies. of our little feathered
friends the pidgeon"). Ite
mind them that they must not hide
behind the pillars because if no
one 'an find them, they will be left
in Albany forever and will be taken
to the llcdrick‘s factory to work
until they die.

One point brought out in class
concerned the necessity of bring-
ing plenty of safety pins along on
a field trip. f". some girl’s
slip string may break . . . "t. It
is also advisable to warn your
class not to tamper with the ln-
burial grounds exhibited. The of
ficials become angry and the In-
diaiis might. too.

It is very important that the
future teacher be able to answer
any questions his class may ask
about the State Museum. Nothing
is excusable.

The Bear Baiter

By Feigel and Ilaenlin

Once upon a time there was a
brilliant, well adjusted student who
had one tragic flaw: he became
obnoxious when he drank. His name
was Antoine. On one portentous
night. after taking the methodical
load. he performed such heroic
exploits as dismantling the cigar-
ette machine, stealing eleven bar
stools. and ogling the waitress. llut
the last straw was when he began
humming. Ile was promptly eject-
ed and suspended indefinitely.

Antoine spent the next six months

strictly in the daytime where he
could be seen sipping in various
accredited junior bars. After much
effort, be made drinking honors.

One day he got word that his old
bar had changed hands, and so he
promtly went for an interview. The
bartender perused his social trans-
scripi and Antoine was finally re-
admitted oii terminal probation,
with the following conditions: he
could not drink more than sixteen
hours a week, he had to get a sat-
isfactory report on his practice
drinking. and he had to submit
a unit imbibing plan. For his final
examination Antoine had to last
through an entire Friday night.

All went well until his big mo-
ment came. He had drunk twenty-
six double stingers and two brandy
alexandres. (h e had carefully
avoided draughtsi. He felt the soft
liquid warmly coarsing through his
veins. lie was in a state of
euphoria. Ile had that richly sen-

of reckless and meticulous aban—

pound sledge hammer, and while
the patrons watched in awed ad-
miration. he punctiliously, anti with
great. attention to detail. pulverized
the entire bar. Needless to say he
