Frosh Courtmen Trounce Oneonta 49-27!

State’s Frosh basketball team of play for a tremendous “point-a-
had a jolly good time of it last
Wednesday night at the Washing-
ton Armory,
hopelessly
squad 49-27. It was State all the
way in this one-sided affair as all
the Feds saw action for the first
time this year.

The ball game was really over
after just five minutes of play as
the Feds grabbed a commanding
14-1 lead. Kirk Ellis nailed three
quick field goals in the first min- that the
utes to get State off and running.
He and Dick Crosett were rivaling
a certain Mr.
Philadelphia, as they each scored
ten points in the first ten minutes

minute” average.
’ By 11:52 the scoreboard showed
eaSily Tompmg 3 a laughable 20-3 total, and Coach
oneonm Hissert began inserting his subs.
State’s second stringers did well
for themselves, playing for about
ten minutes and opening the Frosh
halftime lead to 34-9.
As a team the Feds hit 16-33
field goal attempts in the half for
a shade under 50% shooting aver-
age. Biit it was under the boards
Frosh really enjoyed
themselves, out rebounding Oneon—
ta 18-6. Danny Zeh was the Big
Chamberlain of Daddy for State in this department,
hauling down six in the half and
corraling 14 for the evening.

The second half was a bit of a
different story, however, as Oneon-
ta caught fire and outscored the
Feds 18—15. The poor State perform-
ance was probably due to simple
letdown more than anything else.
When a team has a 25 point half-
time lead, it’s bound to uncon-
sciously ease off.

Things went so poorly for State
during the second half, despite the
fact that the first string went most
of the way, that the Feds scored
just four points in the first 13 min-
utes of play. The men in Purple
& Gold finally began to regain
some of their early form at this
time, and led by Crosett‘s sparkling
play tallied 11 more points.

“Take Me Out To The Ball Game”

This coming weekend should be really a tremendous
one for all our athletes here at State and especially we
athletic supporters. By the time classes begin again Mon-
day our basketball teams will have completed four home
games, and our wrestling squad will have had a match with
Brooklyn Poly (away). Things will begin whirling Friday
at 6:30 pm. (maybe earlier for the T.G.I.F. mg fans) as
our very strong Frosh forces take on Hudson Valley Com-
munity College. From what we hear this team is ranked
first in the East and second in the Nation for two year col-
leges, but our Frosh are going to be up for them and all
we have to say is, “look out for your national ranking, Hud—
son Valley!” .

At 8:30 the Varsity rolls into action against Suffolk
University. Following this a short run (if your date doesn't
mind. and the flow of air down the Western and Washing-
ton Avenue Wind Tunnels does not exceed 70 frigid miles
per hour) will bring you to the Bru game room where you
can partake of the gentle sports of listening, flirting, or
dancing to the wheeling and Dealing of Johnny Tyos
crazy. cool, catchy Campus Counts. Other sports may be
indulged in following the dance.

Having rested up to some extent, we sports fans should
be able to get up in time Saturday night for the Frosh-
R.P.I. game, again at 6:30. Fresh from their win over Sui!
folk our Varsity squad faces Central Connecticutt at 8:30,
After celebrating our victory or drowning the sorrows of
our loss (we have a feeling it will be the first). all good lit-
tle Albany State sports fans will crawl off to bed satisfied
until we must get up for classes Monday when we must
turn our minds back to our scholastic endeavors.

Saturday night the basketball
team made a long and tiring trip
to l’otsdam. It proved to be a suc-
cess however, as the Sauersmen
extended their winning streak to
six games with a thrilling 74-67
overtime victory.

ed the characteristics which have

date. (‘ombining good second half
play and tough rebounding against
a taller club, the team garnered
its twelfth victory in fifteen out—
ings. The team trailed by it points
at the time but fought back ganicly
to take the contest.

The game was a thriller through-

pass by Albany in the final seconds
of play sent the game into over-
'llll(‘ with the score tied 62-62. A
iuinp shot by John Wallace quick-
ly untied it but a l’otsdam bucket
quickly knotted it up again. At this
point in the overtime the victors

Oppedisano Racks 21 Points
As Peels Register 13th Win

By GARY SMITII

The varsity basketball team. who must be feeling like
the well traveled Harlem Globetrotters, kept rolling along.
After a thrilling overtime victory at Potsdam, the team
met a tough Oneonta squad and brilliantly responded with
a 70-54 victory over the Dragons. This was the 13th victory
and 7th in a row for the team. They have lost 3.

The first half was not a prolific scoring contest in
any sense of the word. The team opened strongly with
everyone getting into the scoring column. Leading the
attack were Jim Oppedisano, Bill Carmello, Don Gruol and
Ray Weeks. With about 13 minutes to go the team was
ahead 11—3 as both teams found trouble hitting the hoop.
A jumper by Carmello put the team ahead 13-5 with 12:55
to go in the half. Baskets by Weeks, Casey and Don Gruol
were offset by the hot hand of Joe Mars and Laddie Decker.
Don Gruol canned a jumper to put the team out in front
24—20 as the half came to a close.

It looked like another Albany-Oneonta cliffhanger as
the second half opened but the team began to pull away.
Led by Oppedisano and Weeks the team got off to a fast
start and built up a 31-24 lead. Oneonta recovered slightly
on baskets by Grimm and Decker but Albany once again
shot to the fore by a 47-34 margin. Big Paul Smelkoff
of Oneonta began to hit from the field and foul line to
bring Oneonta to within 9 points. This was the closest
Oneonta was to get though, as a late spurt by the Feds
put out all hopes of an Oneonta comeback. The team
thereafter coasted to their 70-54 victory.

Good rebounding helped carry the team throughout
much of the game. The squad had a rough first half
from the floor, hitting only 9 out of 40 while Oneonta had
7 for 34. Foulwise, the team converted 16 of 27 while their
opponents had 12 for 22. Oppedisano led the Albanians
with 21 points while Deluca (12) and Weeks (11) were also
in double figures. Paul Smelkoff led Oneonta with 15. The
State defense must be mentioned for the sterling work it
did in holding Laddie Decker and Dick White to a com-
bined total of 7 points. These fine ball players had many
shots blocked in their faces all night long.

This weekend is a full one for the team as they face
Suffolk University on Friday night and Central Connecti-
cut on Saturday night. Both games will be played at the
Armory. A good team deserves good student backing -—
try to make it at least one of the two nights.
