Current
Comment

By JOE GALU

In the press conference which
preceded his address in Page Hall,
Dr. Ralph E. Lapp called Ameri-
can plans to build a fifty megaton
bomb an effort “to keep up with
the Joneses.” Dr. Lapp pointed out
that such a weapon can be used
only as an attack by force or an
effort to scare people.

In comparing the destructive
force of different sized bombs, he
showed that a 100 megaton bomb
will destroy only a little more than
twice the amount a 10 megaton
will. He went on to state that the
Russian bomb which produced 57
megatons had a potential of 171
megatons. The reason for the rela—
tively low yield is that a lead cas-
ing was used in order to control
fall out.

Poor Press Coverage Attacked

Dr. Lapp castigated American
press coverage of the Russian test
series for inferring that fall out-
producing megatonage had been
doubled. He stated that 117 mega-
tons of fall out-yielding bombs have
been exploded. The recent Russian
tests contributed only 25 of the 117.

He did not condone the tests; be
merely stated that information
about them had been inaccurate.

He complained that outdated fig—
ures are being used in determining
whether or not our Atlas missile
bases are ‘hard‘ or 'soft'. Curtis
LeMay’s statistics are all out of
date with the result that our Atlas
bases can no longer be considered
safe.

No Shelters In Russia

He stated that the Russians have
no major program or shelter
building and no information con—
cerning civilian defense from at-
tack. Dr. Lapp stated that what
protection there is in Russia is
very “crude.”

110 also stated his belief that at-
mospheric tests need not be re-
sumed. lic pointed out that infor-
mation we have from the Russian
tests is still being analyzed and
avaluatcd.

Why We Are Behind

He traced the development of the
missile and explained why we are
behind. He explained that the Ger-
man V-2 carried a one ton bomb
200 miles. t produced 60,000 tons
of thrust, and was accurate only
to within 15 miles. In 1948 our lead—
ers made a study of our l('Ii.‘\I pro-
gram. An American missile must
be capable of traveling 3,000 miles.
in 1948, such a missile Would be
accurate only to within 20 miles.
Because of the weight of atomic
bombs of that era. our leaders,
military, and civilians decided to
wait for the scientific break-
through before trying to develop a
missile carried defensive force.

He closed with a brief descrip-
tion of what scientists could dis~
cover if there is life on Mars.

Seidman Lauds
State Students

In a recent article in the Satur-
day Review ot Literature, Mr. Da-
vid Boroff stated that only a hand-
ful of students he had interviewed
were familiar with programming
instruction.

Mr. Lloyd Seidman, Chairman of
United Stated Industries, Inc., has
stated that although he realizes
that those students were not neces-
sarily representative of the State
College community, he was so im-
pressed with the statement that he
has made arrangements to have
Mr. Norman A. Crowder, Vice-
l’resident and Technical Director
of United States Industries, Inc., to
speak to students concerning the
rapid strides taken in the field of
programming instruction in the last
few years.

Mr. (‘rowdcr will differentiate
between linear programming, de-
veloped by B. I". Skinner of liar-
v'ard. and branch programming.
