Twelve State Students Camp Out

By JOAN SCHWARTZ

This past weekend twelve State
students, including a fragile New
York City female (the author), took
a dip into the madness of winter
camping at Dippikill, Alb any
State’s campsite. For the benefit
of the many doubting Thomas's at
State, this is a true story of a bold
adventure, but. one that was most
enjoyable and unforgettable. Let
me tell you all about it.

Late Friday afternoon we start-
ed out. We ate dinner and bought
provisions in Warrensburg, the
nearest town to Dippikill, which is
twelve miles north of Lake George.
Dippikill is located on the top of a
ridge so we had to park the cars
about a mile from the campsite
and walk the rest of the way. I was
extremely happy to get my first
look at a toboggan, since all the
provisions were loaded on it. I
breathed a sigh of relief that I
didn‘t have to carry my gear. No.
I didn’t even have to drag the to-
boggan up the hill; the male camp-
ers exercised some of their long
unused muscles. But I‘ll admit that
I did help a little: I walked behind
the toboggan with a flashlight to
make sure nothing fell off.

We arrived at the campsite and
much to my surprise, we weren't
really roughing it too intich. l-lome-
base was a big warm farmhouse.
Well, it really was warm as soon
as we got the fire going in the fire-
place. The main room served many
functions. It was the dining room.
«fl('lal room, and girl’s sleeping
ouai‘ters. Next to this room was the
kitchen: yes. it even had a gas
stove. ()n the outer side of the kit-
chcn was the boys‘ sleeping quar-
ters.

After we finished unpacking, we
settled down to cnjoy ourselves
t\\'llll no textbookst. So like normal
s‘tatc students, we turned our main
room into what could have passed
for the Commons or the Student
L'nion; we sat down to spend an
enjoyable evening playing “llearts”
and "Bridge." When the winners
decided not to push their luck and
the losers had had enough, we de-
cided to hit the sack. Actually we
hit ilic sleeping bags which were
on double dccker bunks. The sleep»

mg bags, along with the fire
in the fireplace, kept us very
warm. liven in this modern age,

the sleeping quartcrs were segre-
gated, that is except for Magoo,
otir trtisty companion and protec-
tor, Now don't jump to any coit-

Saturday morning wc arose and
had breakfast twithout having to
wait in any lincsi. I then got my
first look at lllt' countryside of Dip-
pikill; and it was simply beautiful
outside. Everything was covered
with a pure white snow that had
the untouched look you don’t see
in tlic city. We took otit the toliog-
gans that had served us so well
the night before. As I said before,
ilic farmhouse is on tlic top of a
ridge, so the tobogganing was just
great. As a city brcd girl, I had
never gone tobogganing before; as
you can imagine, I had a Wonder-
ful time, as did everyone else. We
were so busy having fun, one
thought of the tcnipt-raturc; but fin-
ally oiir stomachs reminded us
that it was time for lunch.

After a big lunch. we split. tip
into groups; some wcnt skiing;

some explored the countryside on
snowshoes; and another grottp
went skating. We didn't skate in a
crowded indoor rink or a small
pond, biit we had a tremendous
lake to ourselves. (I‘ll bet half
the students at Albany State don’t
know they are part owners of a
lake). There is a very scenic trail
leading down to thc lake. Just one
warning. Don’t become too absorb-
ed looking at the woodland beauty;
\vatch where you are going. It was
really a change to have a whole
lake for just a few people and one
dog. Yes. Magoo came. skating with

us. He didn't ptit on skates, but
then with his speed he didn't need
them.

Sunday morning after breakfast,
We again went. skiing and tobog-
ganning. I was really sorry when
we started packing after lunch. The
weekend at Dippikill was a marvel-
ous experience; and I was sorry
that it came to an end so soon.

When you realize that a city bred
girl could have such a wonderful
time, I am sure we‘ll be seeing
more of the State College students
on the next outing at Dippikill, Al-
bany‘s own camp. See. you then!

 

Tuesday evening a fairly new
form of group activity was inaug»
urated at State. Mr. Richard Wilkie,
of the English department, enter-
tained those at the Primer meeting
with his folk singing. (in the whole,
the evening was rewarding and in-
teresting. It was refreshing to see
an evening of informal student and
faculty participation. Things got
underway a half-hour late, but a
lively pace was continued once ev-
erything started.

Seegcr Technique

Using a l’cte Seeger-like talk
and sing technique, l\Ir. Wilkie be-
gan by singing songs of economic
and social protest. The audience
was complacent and half hearted,
but eventually a limp chorus of
“’l‘roublc on My Mind" was evoked.
A rather obscure collection of this
type of song finally evolved into
“Pie in the Sky" which, with the
exception of a few mangled verses,
was performed well. Protest (lid
not last long, however, and a few

of folk singing’s stock favorites
such as “Solidarity Forever,”
“Hold the Fort,” and “Miner's
Lifeguard” were regrettably ignor-
cd.

Wilkie’s merits appeared in a
classical version of “Foggy Dew,"
with a rendition putting Ives to
shame, and was competently re-
cnforccd with ballards of dallience.
With his transition to mountain
songs, the true improvision that
makes a folk singer grew evident,
and a “hoot” began. llis encore of
“Old Maid" was excellent and
many more performances would be
appreciated

l'nfortunately, there was a lack
of other banjos and guitars join-
iiig into the singing session. The
audience was apparently unaccus-
tomed to folk music and failcd to
give much of the support needed
for a true folk performance.

State owes a debt to Primer for
inaugurating something that should
be continttcd.

jority of students received more
than four days, for only ten per
cent of the student body fiad finals
on the last day.

However, students complained,
pcr usual. because the dorms were
closed during this time. Nothing
could bc done about it. The cost
of maintaining the dormitories dur-
ing thc brcak was too much; the
difficulty in synchronizing meal
timcs to suit cvcryonc was impos-
sible; amt ilic cxpcctcd response
of taxpaycrs would be against
Statc students receiving hotcl priv—
ilcgcs wliilc school was not in ses-
sion. So, ilic dorms rcmaincd
closed!

Spring Vacation

Other Problems
Many other problems wcrc eti-
countcrcd and conquered by the
committee, The (llavin Travel
agcncy devised a plan for selling
tircyhound bits tickets at the regu-
lar pricc three days before 'aca—
tions. This system also provided
for a pick-tip service in front of
Alden Hall which eliminated taxi
cxpcnscs and loss of time in trans,
f'crring luggage to the terminal.
'l'hc plan has proved to be cffcc»
live and has bccn received by the
students with cuthusiasni.

tance this past year. He has been

When Is A Dining
Room A Library?p

the action which i‘csiiltacd in the

Report dedica-

proxision of tlic l’irubachcr pri-
vatcd dining room as a Sunday
study lounge was pi'ccipatcd by

the refusal of the administration
to pcrmit the llawley Library to
rcmain open on Sundays. Scrvices
t'otiiiiiittcc once again consulted
llt'ttll 'lliornc about this problem.
Why No Sunday Library?

The library 'anot be open on
Sundays for scvc‘al reasons. All
but two of tlic library staff are
(‘ivil Service employees atid are
thus entitled to triple pay and equal
time off at their own convenience if
they work on Sundays. The ad-
ministration could not expect those
two librarians who are considered
faculty mcmbcrs to work on Stin-
days in addition to their regular
working week of six days. Since
the collcgc request for increased
funds for the library has not been
apprmcd, ilic expansion of the
library staff is impossible finan-
cially.

I'Irgo, Bru Study Lounge

Although lllt' library staff could
not bow to ilic student body request
Miss Hastings, head librarian, dis-
cusscd the problem with the com-
mittee. She helped them to ur-
rangc Sunday hours for the library

mittcc in their pltiiis to provide
