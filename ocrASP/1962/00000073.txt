Stare Matmen Cop 3rd Win
As Crow Goes Undefeated

By DICK ROBELOTTO

The Albany State Varsity Wrestling squad extended
its winning streak this past weekend with a solid Victory
over Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, 27-5. Only two pomts
were scored against our team in the match by match break-
down. The five points in the final tally were for the forfeit
we gave Brooklyn in the unlimited class. All of the men
who wrestled had complete control of their opponents
throughout their respective matches.

Ray Bouchard, our first representative on the mat,
decisioned Altama in a highly one—sided match in the 123
pound class. Jay Katzel, our 137 pounder, decisioned his
man, Charlton, with the same score, 3-0.

Four Grapplers On Victory Strings

Since the match with C. W. Post, just after the Christ-
mas vacation, two of our wrestlers. Clem Crow (130) and
Art Brunelle (147), have been undefeated and untied on
the mat. Clem got his fourth victory with a 11-0 decision
over Hartford. Hartford’s endurance was the only thing
that prevented Clem from getting the pin. Art got hlS
fourth straight pin in this last match. Indinpoli was the
victim in 2:41. I

John Woytowich (157) got his second consecutive Win
by pinning his opponent, Zarell, in 4:23. Tom Ellis (177)
got his second straight also with a 5-0 dec1sion over Wolfe.
The only other official wrestler, John Bennett, scored his
first pin of the season in 3:19 over Gomez.

Frosh Lose Sixth In A Row

The Freshman team‘s luck certainly is not getting any
better as once again they fell to defeat, this time to Rock-
land County C. C ., 33—3. Our only Frosh wiiiiicr, Eugene
Monaco, extended his win streak to tour with a 3~0 decision.

Potter lost its first match of the
season this week to a rejuvenated
KB team, 3-1. Led by the heroics
of Claude Frank the men of KB
moved two games closer to the
Club, and are now three games
down. Frank’s return to the KB
forces has been marked by some
rather spectacular bowling, high-
lighted by this week's 616, on
games of 169, 229, & 218.

I’otter won the first game, 803-

Touching All
Bases

By DAVE JENKS
“Take Me Out to the Ball Game”

No, not the basketball game, the football game“ base-
ball game, soccerball game, ping-pong ball game, billiard
ball game, or the volleyball game—I—the bowling ball game.
All right, so maybe they do call it a bowling match, but
could you see me starting off the column With the line.
“Take Me Out to the Ball Match?”

Probably you are now asking yourself, “self, LSth
trying to say something or what?” Well, what I in trying
to say is that we may be missing out on one of the more
interesting sports activities that occurs every week here
at State—the First League Bowling Matches.

Just ask anyone of the guys who bowls in the league
(You can usually identify one by his elongated arm, usually
due to using too heavy a ball or cleverly haying his fingers
get stuck in the ball for two or three tosses—this usually
irritates the proprietors who seem to have a certain dis—
g‘ust at belt buckle gouges half—way down the alley), and
he will tell you that it is not a scrub league.  good share
of the scores and averages look like something out of a
professional bowling league. Games of 200 or more are
common. This past Tuesday, Claude Frank bowled games
of 229 and 218, and finished with a three game total of 616
for a 205 per game average. Of the three games between
the Potter and Kappa Beta pin si'nashcrs, all were (lt‘t‘l(lt"tl
in the tenth and final frame.

You say your bowling average would be double what
it, is now if they set up a couple of pins in the gutter. well.
here’s a chance to learn a little about the rapidly growuig
sport of bowling. The fact that you know most of the guys
participating will make the watching even more fun.

Cl‘ieering. booing, and hissing are allowed, but no pen—
cils. scorebooks, chairs. or extra bowling balls may be
thrown at the competing kcglers. It‘s free and very much
worth your interest. so we‘ll see you next Tuesday at 4 pm.
in Sli'ia's Bowling Alley (Ontario Street just past Washing—
ton Avenue).

Playing perhaps their best game
of the season. the varsity basket-
ball team downed a tough Central
Connecticut squad by a score of
69-60 at the Armory last Saturday
night. In doing so, the team es-
tablished a new record by winning
9 consecutive games. The New
Paltz game scheduled for Wednes-
day night was called off because
of the inclement weather.

By GARY SMITH

Good Team I’lay Shown
The team showed their best coin-
bined play of the season as all
who played helped bring victory
to the squad. The scent of setting

a new record evidently had an
affect on the team. They appeared
to be at a great disadvantage in
rebounding but took a back seat
to no one once the game began.

, Team Has Just 3 Home Games Remaining

State Leads At Half

The first half was as tough a
struggle as the team has had to
face all year long. The Feds broke
to a 15-13 lead and were never
headed although Central Connecti-
cut made it tough going all the
way. Albany had a great foul
shooting half as they canned 14 of
16 from the charity stripe to take
a 34-33 halftime edge.

The second half opened with the
determined home team continuing
the pace. Oppedisano and others
started hitting from close in as
the team began breaking through
the opponents defense to the hoop.
Frangione, Ward, and Cirello were
the big three for the Blue Devils
throughout the second half. A jump
shot by John Wallace put the Sau-
ersmen ahead 48-43. The invaders
fought back. however, but only to
have a layup by Jim Greene put
the squad in front 60-56. Two Con-
necticut tallies made it 62-60 but
buckets by tip and Carmello put
it out of reach.

Greene And Wallace Shine

When quizzed after the game
Sauers stated that Jim Greene and
John Wallace did sterling work
in relief roles for the Staters.
Greene scored 10 points, including
four important foul shots. Wallace
contributed 13, the second straight
night that he hit double figures,
and also engineered the team to
numerous other baskets.

()ppedlsano Cans 31

The real star of the game, how-
ever, was Jim Oppedisano who hit
the individual game high for the
season as he rang in 31 points.
“()p" was definitely an important
factor in the game as he fought
off taller Connecticut players un-
der the boards throughout the
game. .lim, who earlier in the year
changed his foul shooting style to
the underliand method, found it
paid off as he missed only 4 of 19
free throws.

State Not From Line

The team made 22 of 58 from
the floor and a good 25 of 36 from
the foul line The Blue Devils
were 21 for 63 from the floor and
tutor 25 from the charity stripe.
'l‘lie squad has now won it in a
row and will attempt to extend
their skicii this weekend. The
team travels to Brockport tonight
and tomorrow takes on IIobart at
their court. Next week the team

makes its home court finale as
they face I’lattsburgli on Friday
and Uswcgo on Saturday. After

that it is the Cortland ’l‘ournament

'on March l-il. The final two home

games are important ones for the
squad and a good turnout might
help secure two more victories.
This team has been a fine one all
year and deserves your support
