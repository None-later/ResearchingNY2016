To the New Administration

We’ve discovered some new traditions that have been
developing the last few years. One of the traditions is an
“age-old“ one called apathy, but now it has a new twist.
It’s sponsored by Student Association. Another fast-grow-
ing tradition is called unfair selection on the basis of little
experience.

Why is there no system of tryouts for committee chair-
men or members? Why aren’t positions given to people
because of ability and experience instead of friendship or
politics? A few college leaders have never attended a Home-
coming Weekend, and last year’s co-chairman was one of
them. And why did someone choose a Parents' Day co-
chairman who had never before attended a Parents‘ Day?
These people did very commendable work, but couldn‘t.
someone with more experience (and more time) have ac-
complished even more? How many of the most qualified stu-
dents were given an opportunity to contribute their time
and effort and talent to the Frosh Handbook? Why
couldn’t there have been some system of volunteers with
selection on the basis of interest, ability, and time?

Better methods of selecting students to organize Activ-
ities Day, Rivalry, State Fair etc. would also contribute
greatly to the effectiveness of extra—curricular activities.
The majority of Albany State students were extremely active
in high school; in college, however, they have been con—
tinually thwarted by the efforts of student government to
recognize only the “elite.” The inactive student deserves
the opportunity to gain those oft—cited “benefits of extra-
curricular activities." The next time someone comments
that state College is manipulated by a very few students.
remember ~— it isn‘t necessary. You have the responsibility
of correcting the situation

Suppression ?

The time has come for official recognition. of our
"rival" publication. suppression. We believe that somc
articles appearing in suppression are in questionable taste.
but if it is allowed ot continue. the staff could develop a
discriminating editorial policy. Two brief issues are not
damning evidence requiring an immediate death sentence
without a longer trial. Some conservative members of stu-
dent government and the, administration have suggested
that it shoould be published only with the approval and
under the direction of Student Association. We suspect
that these people are more interested in eliminating or
censoring this publication than in providing suppression
with funds and the more stable position which it would
assume as a recognized student activity.

Are the students afraid to admit the existence of rad~
icalism and creativity on our campus, or are they irration-
ally indignant about something they do not understand?
Many faculty members condone and support suppression.
Such approval should at least convince the conservatives
among us that the publication should be seriously consid—
cred.

We encourage this attempt to express creative, critical
thought among our rather parochial students and hope
that it will be allowed to improve rather than be stifled by
dogmatic conservatism.

Focus
on Faculty

By MARY LOU DAMOTII

Dr. James Cochrane, professor

in the Education Department and _

supervisor in Milne. where he is
chairman of the English Depart-
ment, is very interested in the
teaching profession particularly as

it affects the college student who V

is developing philosophies and tech-
niques.

Born in Brooklyn, Dr. Cochrane
has lived
Schuylerville, N. Y. He did his
undergraduate work at Williams
College. His masters‘ he earned
at Albany State, and his doctorate
at the University of Connecticut in
1955. Married in 1938, he has no
children. only a “neurotic cocker
spaniel."

Education Courses

When asked his opinion of educa-
tion courses, he says that he feels
they are very useful as future
teachers learn through experience
as well as from courses in their
major. Methods courses and stu-
dcnt teaching. he says, act as a
bridge between college and the first
year of tear-hint!

Other Interests
Dr. ('ochraiic's interests arc far
from being restricted to education.
llis versatility is shown by the
diversity of his i'l(‘ll\'llit‘s, llc cn-
joy's swimming. playing golf. and
reading llc hkcs cars and is

To the Editor:

Being very closely associated
with the Great Decisions program
at State this year, I appreciated
the very satirical nature of the
article “Big Brother Turns lied,"
by Ken Brady in last week‘s issle.
However, many people not know-
ing the facts about the Foreign
Policy Association might have been
misled by Mr. Brady‘s subtle sar-
casni, especially as many right
wing organizations have made the
very same totally unfounded accus-
ations. Therefore i feel that the
facts should be set down and people
sci straight.

The Foreign Policy Association
takes no stand on issues and sup-
ports iioiic of the alternatives which
it offers in its publications. if
any of its publications are studicd.
one can sc that it prt-sciils, as
much as it can, all relevant aspects
of an issue. and urges the reader
to make up his own mind which
onc he thinks is correct. What
could be more American than this
ft‘ccdom of speech and discussion
and the right of one to make his
own (lccis‘iotis‘f

Let's face it — everyone
make Myskania: they just
have the stuff in them.

There seem to be show horses
and work horses. The show horses
should be split into two classes.
but apparently people aren't dis-
cerning enough to see the differ-

ence between thoroughbrcds and
noisy plugs that should be also-
rans. The only recognition the

work horses seem to get is bigger
plows to haul. (This of course does
not cover all contingencies.)

l Wonder why people who have a
special ability and develop it to its
utmost aiid at the same tiliic ren-
der incstimablc service to the col-
lege because of the superior quality
of their work do not receive full

2.) The present method of vot-
lng should be evaluated. Perhaps
it might be wise to bar Freshmen
from voting on Myskania; after all,
they can only judge those who have
the time and the political ambition
to see them. Or, in an effort to
somewhat nullify untutored voting,
perhaps Myskania should vote for
its successors with blocks of votes:
200 for those recommended; 150
for the next best qualified; 100 for
those still fairly well qualified; 50
and U for those less qualified. This
would be returning to a system
that allows the public to voice its
opiiioii but allows Myskania a
greater role in picking its succes-
sors.

Previously a minimum number
of votes was necessary for election
to Myskania. (‘crtainly getting at
least it) or 12 percent of the total
college enrollment or even 35 per-
cent of the total vote cast is little
enough to ask. People who do not
rcciyc 5 or 7 percent of total on
rollincnt or 20 percent of votes cost
should be ineligible for the second
election if it is necessary.

3.) Scholarship should be con-
sidered in all election areas. There
has been a tic-emphasis on schol
airship in all areas. but what per
cciitagc is thcl'c in electing sonic-
one who will bilgc out the next
scincstcr‘.’ A person at 2.7 can af-
I'ord to drop to 2.4, but what about
slililt'lllll‘ at 2,1"

i.) What is the correlation be-
tween sorority and fraternity mem-
bership and votes‘.’ There are be-
twccn Elllll and a thousand students
lll sororities and fraternities. Re
member how many votes were
cast'.’ Maybe the tiDl's should add
another lcttcr- l for indolent. Fur-
lllcl'llitil‘c. it seems extremely dif-
ficult for an active independent to
be elected to lly‘skania.

Something positive must be done
about the cvi-r-dccrcasing stand-
ards on our campus. The competi-
tion is going to be a lot tougher
with enlargement: our aims should
be set hiin and kept there—or even
raised. I hope that a seat on Mys-
kania remains the prestige office it
has been, but I also think that
somctliing should be done to insure
this hope.
