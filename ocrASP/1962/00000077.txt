The Uses of Tyranny

\\hat our nation requires is t
li'tle old-fashioned tyranny. There
is nothing that so tests character
as to lie oppressed; for when we
are free to act as We choose. we
nencrally choose to make asses of
ourselves, There is no group that
l ‘Eill call to mind possessed of
greater freedom than the l’ieatniks

Tactics Versus The Beliefs

By JOE GALU

Senators Harry ti‘nldwatcr and
Strum 'l‘liuriiiimd have suggested
that President Kennedy add some
right-wing extremists to his ad-
ministration to halaiice snnte ot'
the left-wing extremists.

l'Ixtreiiiism is a current topic of
discussion. It has hceii said that
staunch consertatiycs 'all every-

pained my charge with explanation.
The llircli Society calls manda-
tory registration of arms. the
"liinridatinn of water, and the in-
"nine tax Communist plots. The Sn-
ciety says that all people who sup-
port such things as the above are
“cniiissyinps,” meaning Commun-
ist syiiipatliizcrs.

I feel that such statements are
extreme. but I do not call anyone
an extremist for expressing such
a view. I do call the Birch So~
eiety an extremist group because
of the methods they advocate, not
liecause of views, When the leader
of a group asks its members to file
'ards on the enemies of the repub-
|i ' and states that hy these enemies
lie is referring to ('ttmmllnISlS, lib-
erals and the fellow travelers of
these groups. I feel the group is
engaging in extremist tactics. The
(.‘oiiimtinists hare heeii known to
use this card file technique. When
members of a group are urged to
send anonymous letters to employ-
crs accusing ciiiplnyees of being on-
gaged in plots against the republic.
I again feel that mnde‘ate hounds
have heeii exceeded.

The card file system and the
anon) iiious letter technique are but
two of the methods used by the
John Iiil't‘Il Society. Because of
their methods. I call the Birchites‘
extremists.

It seems a hit strange that the
self proclaimed most conservative
group is so lilieral in selecting their
tactics I helieve in attaining Iih—
eral reforms hy the accepted
lilt'iilis

these extremists are the iiieinhers
of the Americans for Democratic
Action or the ADA. I am waiting
with unimaginable patience to hear
some of the extremist tactics used
hy the ADA.

The critics of the ADA suggest
that this group is radical or ex»
ti'einist hecause of its views. Until
a group is shown to he radical in
its tactics, I will not consider it a
danger to our country,
