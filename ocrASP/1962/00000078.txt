Clem Crow was also victorious in his three matches.
Pinning Bremsen (Hobart) in 2:45, he won the next two
matches by forfeit. This continues his string of victories
to seven. He has earned a total of 33 points compared to
the zero scored against him. He is the only undefeated var-
sity wrestler and also the varsity leader in the most con-

secutive wins.

in the KB-Madison match the
story was almost the same. KB won
the match 3-1, but it was three of
their pledges bowling on the Mad-
ison team that prevented the KB
team from making a clean sweep.
In the first game KB lost by fifty
pins. as pledges Kimball. Little.
and Phillips combined to down the

one end of the forward positions.

Now we come to the two “big” men of the squad; the
two men who consistently hit for double figures and really
reap those rebounds. The first of these. stationed at the
other forward slot, is our big Catskill Mountain man Dan-
ny Zeh. Besides carrying out his job of clearing the boards.
Danny employs a soft. floating jumper to rack up a 14.8
points per game average. And last. but by far not least. at
