Last Wednesday night, the IFC-
ISC met in joint session to institute
some constructive program that
would describe and evaluate the
present status of Greek organiza-
tions at the College of Albany. It
is felt by the IFC-ISC that many
non-Greek members will have a dif-
ferent and valuable viewpoint on
Greek life as it is and as it should
be. Therefore, any member of the

student body who feels that they
would like to participate in this
program please contact via Student

The IFC-ISC is sponsoring this
program in conjunction with the

ALBANY, NEW YORK, FRIDAY, MARCH 2. 1962

Detectives Track Down State Fair
Saturday» Nig  Reckless Chase

Open Letter -

To the Board of Trustees. Administration, Faculty,
Students of State University, and the Editor:

1 am not one for writing letters to the Editor ordinarily, but after
reading — with disbelief and consternation — the notice in the issue
of February 23 that students declaring themselves Liberal Arts candi-
dates would be required to pay retroactive tuition, I must set aside
my policy, because such blatant decisions as the Board’s require strong
words and stronger actions, if possible.

My immediate reaction to the whole affair is: This is absurd! But
upon further consideration, l have decided there is more than absurdity
involved.

The Board‘s decision to make Liberal Arts tuition retroactive is
a very neat bit of intimidation, previously limited to underworld badger
games. To make the changeover to a Liberal Arts system is an admir-
able and welcome policy change, a pic of detectable possibilities. But
the pie is being offered with one hand, while the other hand, unseen
behind the back, appears to have a firm grasp on a blackjack. Un-
doubtedly the pic was made with hemlock.

What choice do you leave us, honorable gentlemen of the Board?
Realistically. now, how many of us could find $1300, in addition to
present costs, in four whole years —-~ much less at the rap of a chair-
man‘s gavel" Especially in a college which is so short of dormitory
space that people are required to triple tip in dorms (at absurd prices).
and more important, where people. as a result of dorm shortages. are
rcipnred to go otit and live on the economy! Have the honorable
gentlemen of the Board ever tried to live on the economy with the
funds of the average State ('ollege student?

The only real choice the Board has left many of us, as I see it,

is either to be honest, and drop out of school, or lie and get a degree
from the school of education. The latter, admittedly, would not be
difficult, since State students have had to do so for years. But. what
of those of its who came to State with the honest intention of teaching.
and min since being here have changed otir minds? Perhaps We
should have dropped out of school then, but the possibility of facing
a degree-conscious society without a degree is a frightening one to
some people. And some. people just wanted an education, even at the
cost of a little moral hypocrisy.
Then, on the horizon, loomed the possibility of a Liberal Arts
program, and tor many, hopes rose that the kind of education which
had been desired, but could not be afforded, might be available. At
first. the idea of tuition in the Liberal Arts school was distasteful, but
finally the idea became tolerable. By skipping lunches and working
an extra hour every day this summer, maybe the money for a year‘s
accumulated

tuition could be

Suddenly, the bombshell of rctroactivity and with it, the implied
dictum: “We need teachers, and we mean to get them by any means
If you want a tuition free education, teach. If you don‘t

Sounds like a bad Western. But.

To the students who had hoped to make the changeover, but now
find they cannot afford it, I appeal that they react against the Board’s
decision — with words amt action. Talk to your professors, your
parents. write to assemblynien and alumnae. Bo s'i intelligently and
forcefully. and for this once. overlook possible repercussions. With
sufficient energy, you will awaken the force of intelligent public
opinion ~~ and in the litre of such a force. repercussions bcconic sling
shots against cannons.

I urge the liditor of the News to print this letter on page one,
in double columns, thereby illustrating the Nch’ opposition to retro-
acli\e tuition, for only by departure from contentional journalism
Wlll you underscore the urgency of your opposition to bludgeoning
intimidation

’l'hc honorable gentlemen of the Board, finally, I urge to hastily
reconsider their decision in the interests of honest and respectable

education.
