Founded in 1917, Myskania Establishes
Traditions and Functions as Judiciary Body

In spite of all superstition.
MYSKANIA seems to consider thir—
teen a lucky number. This year‘s
newly elected thirteen are carrying
on a long tradition that began on
Friday the 13th. 1917. It was first
known as Student Council and was
originated by a Faculty Commit-
tee. A week later the organiza-
tion announced that its name would
be MYSKANIA, the meaning of
which was to remain a secret to
all except members.

Their first accomplishment was
to write a constitution for the stu-
dent body. and to lead the weekly
assemblies. Thus MYSKANIA led
the way to student government at
State. Actually, most of the school's
history can be traced through the
history of MYSKANIA. The judi-
cial body founded and organized
practically all the major groups
of campus.

In its first year. MYSKANIA
provided a News Constitution to
the infant State College News. It
also inaugurated in that year the
now-traditional custom of tapping
the incoming members of MYS-
KANIA. This ceremony was just
one part of the first full length
Moving Up Day.

One of the big events of the fol

lowing year. which was reported
as a "long echoing shock” was

Myskic's suggestion to Student As-
sociation that it Ul‘lL’lttult' a drain
atics club. In March. ISIIEJ. Dram

atics and Art (‘ouncil was intro
duced

in 15120 the system of class of
ficers was incorporated and (‘ain-
pus Day Rivalry was begun
Rivalry itself was initiated two
vcars before because MYSKANIA
felt that It would he a solution to
a "badly needed tiiiified ('ollege
Spirit"

t‘ccnie I'Indreny ‘51 compiled and
wrote much of the history which
follows



'I'Ill‘l Jl'NIOIt I’ltllM QUEEN

   

In 1946. just after the war. feel-
ings of democracy stirred within
the student body. This feeling led
to editorials against the fact that
MYSKANIA was undemocratic
since it was self-perpetuating. Five
members each year were selected
by the faculty and the remainder
by the outgoing MYSKANIA. Thus,
in 1916. Student Association voted
that new members be elected by
the student body. The motions was
passed although the existing MYS-
KANIA objected on the basis that
it had created the Student Asso-
ciation and therefore couldn't be
changed by the latter. To facilitate
the new system of election, the ex-
istent MYSKANIA completely dis-
banded and also destroyed many
old MYSKANIA files. In April of
1946. a temporary Judicial Body
was set tip until May of that year
win-n the first elected MYSKANIA
was inaugurated on Moving Up
Day It was at this time that MYS-
KANIA began its custom of recom-
mendations, The transition went
smoothly and this new system
proved successful.

The president of SA. was eligible
for election to MYSKANIA This
was changed by the constitution
adopted in 1958 by the student
body This constitution. under
which we are now operating. pro-
vided for January to January elec-
tions. 21 Senate. and Inaugural Day

MYSKANIA is now the judicial
branch of the Student Association
and maintains a secrecy because
as a judicial body it must be iin
partial before any of its decisions
are made According to our pre-
sent ('onstitiition. the duties of
M YSKANIA shall be It to interpret
the SA ('onsiitution. Hi to try all
Impeachment cases. It) to act as a
court appeal. it to consider cases

is the purpose of MYSKANIA to
uphold the traditions of the college
at all times. Being elected to
MYSKANIA is the highest non-
academic honor a member of the
student body may attain.
Faculty Members
Many of our present faculty
members served at one time as
members of MYSKANIA. Miss
Edith Wallace served on the first
MYSKANIA as seat number three.
Mr. William Dumbleton was a seat
number one Myskie. Mr. Frank
Krivo and Mr. Douglas Penfield
have also been Myskania members.

’Rocco and His Brothers'

.
A ReVIew
By PAUL JENSEN

Is the world a vile and decaii

dent place which (lcsecratcs what-

ever it touches" This question has

been put to us in three recent
Italian moves: "La Dolcc Vita,"
"Ii'Avventura" and “Rocco and
tits Brothers." The first gave an

emphatic. “Yes!” The second is.
unfortunately. unavailable to At
bany residents (condemned by the
('atliolic Legion of Decency. no
local theater dares show it.) The
third is now available for inspec-
tion at the Delaware Theater. The
question is forcefully put, with con
siderablc emotional impact, and
the answer is again a resounding.
“Yes!”

The story concerns a mother and
her five sons, who move from their
rural home in southern Italy to a
city in the North (Milan) The city’s
degrading atmosphere soon infects
them. By the end of the film. the
family had split up with one bro-
ther, Simon, reduced to the state
of a wild animal. Rocco, however,
remains kind. generous. forgiving.
even saintly. Because of this he
is continually downtrodden. What.
we are asked, can Rocco do to re-
taiii his saintliness in the midst of
such moral aiid physical corrup-
tion?

No ready-made answers are supv
plied, but two rays of hope are left
shining. One is exemplified by the
oldest brother Vinccnzo. who has
freed himself from the authority
of his mother. The city accom
plished this in one of its rare mor
ments of kindness, It seems un-
likely that such an event could also
occur for Rocco. The second pos
sibility is the one that Rocco
seizes: returning to the South. and
home The ending. howeu-r. im-
plies that he can never return to
his former life; the seeds of cor-
ruption have been sown. and the
result is inevitable

Exactly three hours long when it
opened in New York t‘ity. “Rocco”
lost thirty five minutes during its
trip up the Hudson The missing
sections do not seriously affect the
continuity. but there are a few con

fused changes of scene In one
way. this film is unique. it not

only has dubbed dialogue. but also
I‘Iiiglis‘h subtitles. Althouin the
movie is Italian. some of its actors
are French. causing some of lllc
dialoguc to be dubbed in Italian

haps the most original aspect of
the film. The throughout

music is

th'llllil

to watch the operatic gesticulations
of the mother in contrast to the
more restrained motions of the
younger generation.

“Rocco and llis Brothers" is a
“new-realistic" film and shows that

life is earnest. The gymnasium
manager‘s outburst against his

charges is iiproariotis, not only be-
cause of its passionate extrava-
gance springing out of the situation,
but because it shocks us in this
context. where humor is extremely
rare.

Rarer still in this “real” world
is the joy of romance. Romance
has either a technical proficiency
that is as joyless as a machine, or
it is a mockery, as when Simon
flirts with the manager of the
cleaning establishment in order to
steal her brooch. Only once does
the happiness of love appear. Rocco
embraces his sweetheart on a bus.
The scene is lovely. lyrical, and
effusive. but it lasts for a split

second of this two-hour-and-a-half
movie

At one grand climax. Simon
breaks up his brother's love af-

fair. 1 spare the reader a descrip
tion of it; I wish the film-maker
had spared me. The scene is ugly.
terrifying. and too bad to be true.
