Is Press Bureau Needed?

There are some organizations at this State College at
Albany that no longer fulfill their intended functions and
are presently incapable of meeting new and pressmg de-
mands. Press Bureau is an outstanding example! Releas-
ing the names on Dean’s List to the students: hometown
newspapers is one task only partially accomplished in the
past semesters. The bulletin board outsrde the IBM room
is another shining example of constant communication
with city papers. In bygone days we used to stop once ev-
ery two or three weeks and minutely peruse the board on
the chance that perhaps one clipping had been changed—
we were constantly disappointed.

However, Press Bureau has a very impressive meeting
schedule; it has had at least two meetings this year. So
of course everyone who has evinced any interest in the or—
gariization has been given every possible opportunity to
work.

It is our hope that a revitalization of Press Bureau is
one of the major objectives of our new Ministry of Commu-
nications. Instead of being merely a dusty cabinet in a
corner of the News office, Press Bureau could be a major
factor in creating and maintaining good relations with the

outside world.

Mailbox Clutter

Once upon a time Campus Commission tried to keep
the Commons clean. Unfortunately it apparently neglect-
ed and has continued to neglect one of the most important
facilities of the Commons—the student mailboxes. Within
these wooden boxes are such antique communications as
first semester marks and Christmas cards. such unaddress—
ed messages as general announcements of meetings, and
such “extra legal" notes as small scraps of paper contain-
ing no date.

Mailbox regulations are supposedly as follows: “1.)
Use a note that is at least 2” by 4”; 2.) No books are to be
put in the boxes; 3.) No mail is to be placed on top of boxes;
4.) Outside of note must contain name and date; 5.) Gen-
eral notices may be put up on the outside of boxes only
with the permission of Campus Commission; 6.) Mailboxes
will be cleaned every two weeks; any mail not picked up
within that time will be removed."

‘ We have only
one reaction: of what use are regulations which are never
carried out or mini ccd'? Why can’t someone actually clean
the boxes every two weeks or even every week? A half hour
spent cleaning stuck at mailboxes would contribute untold
happiness to your bunny students. And why couldn’t some—
one throw out not only old mail but also mail which does
not conform to the icgulations‘.’

Sounds horribly efficient, doesn't it‘.’

Many of the mailbox problems could be avoided if
Campus Commission establisth a bulletin board directly
above the mailboxes. This bulletin board could list the
mailbox regulations so that no one would have the excuse
of ignorance Such ll bulletin board would also be convent-
ent for posting those general notices of meetings which
now occupy so much space in the already overcrowded
mailboxris.

(PS.
correct parking problems

Congratulations on a very sincere endeavor to
iii-st of luck.)

To the Editor:

The editorial “Perennial Parking
Problem" appearing in the March
2 issue of State College News has
finally brought to light the serious-
ness of the parking problems which
face commuters at State College.
The editorial is very correct in
stating that a shortage of parking
space does exist, bttt is also very
narrow-minded in stating that this
problem is “further complicated"
by the drivers who park their cars
adjacent to the sidewalk in front of
the parking lot.

(‘ommon sense alone, plus a 3rd
grade comprehension of arithmetic
reveals that if 10 cars are parked
adjacent to the sidewalk, then to
more. vacant spaces will be left on
the parking lot, therefore, creating
20 more available parking spaces
instead of ill And since the lack
of space is so acute. these [li'i‘i't‘l's
who park their cars adjacent to the
sidewalk are helping to case the
parking problem rather than coin-
plicaie it as the editorial llil\ \l)
erroneously stated

Secondly, since these cars ill't'

they could not (under normal coir
cepts of logic) be adding to the
confusion and licdlzim which eXisi
within the parking lot itself.

it is. however, unfortunate that

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, MARCH 9, 1962

The Expert on the World?

by Joe Galu

J. Edgar Hoover has been used
and disused by both the right and
left wings of American politics.

The right wing has used him as
a minor deity. They have used his
statements out of context against
all persons they dislike. The re-
stilt has been that many people
whose opinions are left of center
have come to regard J. Edgar
Hoover as something less than he
really is. Sarcastictilly some lib-
erals call him the "expert on the
world."

i do not regard lloo\cr as an
cxpcrt on the world; i do consider
him to be one of top experts on
the nature and tactics of ('ominu-
nism, especially the actions of
(‘ommiinisis lll America

Many people regard llooicr :is
being aniilibcriil He is not in
his book, Masters of Deceit, he
states that t'oinmunisin is opposed
to lll)t‘l‘llll~‘lil and that tommiinists

attempt to take advantage of lib-
eral movements.

Hoover calls (‘ommunisin Red-
l"as‘cism. it is often said that the
people living, or rather existing.
under a dictatorship cannot tell if
the dictator is of the right or the
left.

lloovcr has said that the aims
of the American liberal and the
aims of Communists are in no way
similar. Liberals are for equal 0p-
porltuiities for all: they are for fair
treatment of the lower classes and
:ill the other causes liberals es-
potlsc Hoovcr states in Masters of
Deceit that although Communists
talk in favor oi so-called liberal
causes they are against these
causes and merely use them to gain
support

in an article in the li‘ebruary 15
issue of the American Bar Associ-
ation Journal, J. Edgar Hoover
pointed out that with regard to our
fight against i'ommunism "we

need more light and less heat."

He also asserted his views on
calling liberals Communists "We
must remember that many non~
(.‘ommunists may legitimately, on
their own, oppose the same laws or
take positions on issues of the day
which are also held by the Com-
miinists.

"Their opinions, though tempor-
arily coinciding with the party line,
do not make them Communists. Not
at all. We must be very careful
with our facts and not brand as
Communist any individual whose
opinion may be different from our
own.

“Freedom of dissent is a great
heritage of America which we must
treasure."

i do not consider Mr. Hoover a
crusading liberal, but at the same
time I refuse to listen to people
who attempt to twist his views into
a “Conservatism is the only an-
swer" line

first teachers' strike, called on
Monday, November 7, 1960.

strike as follows: “The strike is
designed to focus the greatest pos-
sible attention on the shameful
neglect of our schools, and the dif
f'iciilty in attracting new teachers
to the city,"

Specifically. the teachers went
on strike to win promotional in-
crements. the right to collec-
tive bargaining with the Board of
l'ifllli‘illliiil, sick leave for substi-
tiite teachers. a ducschcck-off. a
full lllll'l)‘ minute lunch period (ac
tiuilly required by law), and a new
