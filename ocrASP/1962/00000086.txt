Eight New York State Students Tour “Stilltll Aerea

Heavy Seas
Beach Project

During the second week of Jami»
ary tlte tour was almost beacltcd
on an uninhabited coast of Pan»
ama. The crew was tinahle to ar-
range for passage to (‘olombia aitd
ltad to attempt to use tltcir "duck"
to make the rough voyage along
the Caribbean coast to Turbo, Co-
loiitbia. They ltad spent four weeks
on the Isthmus repairing tlteir
craft with the aid of the United
States armed forces. They arrang-
ed to be escorted by a native fish-

ing boat which was enroute to
Colombia.
"El l’ato Valientc" was forced

to fight ten foot waves in the Carib
bean. and only two of the eight
crew members were well enough
to man the vessel. Even Robin, the
German shepherd, was seasick.
They lost contact with their escort
twice during the voyage. The duck
was completely disabled when its
propeller shaft broke off its sup-
port and was left dangling. The
craft banged into gasoline tanks
which were being towed by the es-
cort. The two outboard motors
which were to be used for auxiliary
power had been under water so
long that they could not rtin. At-
tempts to tow the "duck" in the
boiling water proved unsuccessful.
so the craft had to be beached in
the Panama jungle. Bob llinds and
Ed Naylor managed to catch a
ride into Colon aboard a cocoantit
boat. The rest of the crew built a
htit of fern palms and subsisted on
cocoanuts and fish. George Burril
accidentally shot himself in the leg
and was flown out of the jungle by
helicopter.

An amphibious craft front near-
by lt‘t. Davis towed the damaged
reset to port. The group left Colon
aboard the steamship Bolivia en
route to Cartegena, Colombia, after
the “duck” had been repainted and
repaired.

U. 5. Duck Visits

Seventeen N ations

The trip was in the planning
stages for two years. Over a year's
time will be spent touring seven-
teen Central and South American
universities. The students intend to
visit eighty universities and cover
27,000 miles in their journey. They
began the totir last August and
hope to return in August. At pres-
ent tltey are in Baranquilla, Colom—
bia where they are visiting the
family of Pedro Itecio whom they
met at Cobleskill Junior College.

The boys thought that they
would make a better impression
upon South American young peo-
ple if they were itot sponsored by
a government agency. Their “priv-
ate Peace Corps" is financed by
their parents. proceeds front lec-
tures, Rotary (‘lub donations. and
other professional organizations.
They have letters of recommenda-
tioit front three t'. S. Senators and
the staunch support of the State
Department. Three hundred pounds
of dog food was donated to them—
tlten someone gave them a German
shepherd. The American Automo-
bile Association has asked them to
report on road cottditions in South
America. and films of their trip
are sent to NBC every three weeks

Adventures in the U.S.

They travellerl cross-country
from the northeastern United
States to Texas, causing amaze-
ntent and epidemics of newspaper
articles wherever they went. In
Akron, Ohio, an excited woman
called police. saying that a “bunch
of Spaniards" were in a field in a
queer-looking contraption. “They
are talking and singing in Spanish
and there's a big Spanish sign on
their crazy-looking wagon!" Com-
mented the puzzled policeman,
"Those kids sure can sing in Spati-
ish." in Chicago, lllinois. the crew
moored their craft temporarily at
the Cook County Sheriff's Station
in Bedford Park, where sonte sym<
pathizers offered them free lodg-
ing for the night. Everywhere on
their trek across the U. S. they met
encouragement aitd help.

By DAV E .IENKS

 

 

Now that big time basketball at State has burst ottt of
the confines of Page Gym to fill the vast, expanses of thc
Albany Armory. one might think that our little sardine
can type excuse for a gym might become a useless append-
age to state college basketball. But. such is not the ‘ttse
as has been evidenced by the AMIA's valiant completion of
another successful intramural season. This may not seem
like much of an accomplishmcnt. but with gym classes,
Milne sports. and girls‘ intramtirals trying to squeeze tltc
last of the hoopstcrs out of Page. Commissioner Kim Gif-
ford deserves a lot of credit for supervising a very succh
to] season and post—season tournament.

The following men were chosen by the team captains;
as this year's All-Stars.

AMTA ALL-S’l‘ARS—Jhiii Cohen. .liiit ()ison, Vito D'Ang‘el»
