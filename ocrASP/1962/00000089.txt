Crisis Facing School Aid

By KENNETH BRADY

Every day an average of 2,750
children are added to the list of
those who must enter America’s
overcrowded public schools. As a
result, next year’s school enroll-
ment will be 1.000.000 above this
year’s record of 37,500,000.

When the public schools opened
last September. they were short
127,000 classrooms; thus, nearly
1,700,000 more pupils had to be
crammed into schools not built to
handle the increase. This over-
crowding came despite a record
72,000 classrooms built during the
previous twelve months.

States and local communities
have attempted to provide enough
money to keep abreast 01' this ex-
panding school age population; but
many have not succeeded. Federal
aid to education appears to be the
only solution.

Kennedy's Program

President Kennedy is urging a
comprehensive program of Federal
aid to elementary and secondary
schools, lie has proposed spend-
ing $2.1 billion over the next three
years for building schools and for
raising tcachcrs' salaries.

Last year, the Senate passed a
similar bill to provide $2.3 billion
for school construction and for wage
increases; however. the bill never
reached the floor of the llouse. This
was due partially to the bill's omis-
sion of Federal aid to parochial
schools.

President Kennedy has omitted
aid to parochial schools again this
year. He told a press conference
that he would have to oppose Fed-
eral aid to church schools “on
Constitutional grounds — unless
there is a new judgment by the
Supreme Court."

Cardinal Spellman

mediateiy called Kennedy’s pro-
gram "a dagger threatening our

To the intellectually cliti: the critic
is an ubiioXious malconteiit at
tempting to carp his way up the
ladder. To the artistic element the
critic is regarded as the cniious

very existence." The Cardinal said:
“If the Federal Government should
favor the public schools and put
an additional tax on us, from
which we would receive no benc-
fit, then, my friends, it is the even-
tual end of our parochial schools."
First Amendment

it is clear that the First Amend-
ment flatly prohibits aid to paro-
chial schools. It should also be ob-
vious that we cannot permit poli-
tical bickering to prevent urgently
neded funds from going to public
schools. if we allow narrow mind-
ed politicians to make Federal aid
to education an “all-or-nothing"
proposition, we are inviting a crisis
in American education.

TSPOKEN VOICES

 

 

Let’s face it — just about the
only topical thing to write about
this week is the weather. Every-
one seems obsesscd with the idea.
When I asked every person I know
(as I usually do on Tuesday night)
what 1 should write this column
about. the only thing anyone said
was, “How about Spring???"

To begin, Spring at State means
a combination of two things -—
weekends and term papers.

Have you noticed that girls are
especially friendly after March 20.

State Senator Suggests Banning
Controversial SUNY Speakers

The issue of whether or not
students of a State supported col-
lege have the right to hear contro-
versial speakers has again been
raised.

llr. Linus Pauling. a physicist,
in a speech at the College ol' Medi-
cine at Syracuse University made
predictions that millions of i'uture
babies will be born deformed be
cause of the fallout produced by
nuclear explosions.

State Senator John ii. Hughes
(Republican from Onondaga) wants
"to bar controversial speakers
from using facilities of the State
University." Senator llughes‘
statement has been called “asin-
ine" by another state senator.

S t a t e l'niversity President.
Thomas 11. iiamilton. replied that
he believes in freedom of' speech,
freedom of thought and freedom
of dissent.

Scnbendi

Senator iiiighes replied to Dr,
llamilton by calling Dr. Pauling
a leading member of the ('oms
munist "Peace Offensive" and
claiming that Pauling favors Rus~
sioii principles of disarmament. lie
also stated that Pauling feels
America is not working i'or dis
armament. Hughes said that he is
not against freedom of speech or
freedom of thought, but that he is
against this "('ommunist" follow-
er.

iiughes does not call Pauling a
(‘oiniiiunist lie states that Pauling
is performing their work. Senator
Hughes is not against freedom of
speech; apparently he is against
freedom ol' speech only for some-

one he wants to call an agent of

the Communists.

Hughes started his attack by
hitting "controversial speakers."
He has now retreated to the hal~
lowed ground of anti-Communism
