By DAVE JENKS

Hello Spring

Ah yes! .' Spring has once again started to spurt and
sputter in our beloved State Capitol. Gone are the dull
gray snow clouds of winter; replaced by the crisp clear
blue sky, whisps of puffy clouds, and the much welcomed
radiance of the spring sun. Our steps seem much livelier
and full of bounce which is very convenient with all the
puddles and ponds we have to jump. But, even in these
mirky puddles and the mud and mire which accompany
them there is reflected the refreshing growth and pleasant-
ness of spring, and an occasional wet foot or muddy note
book cannot dampen the vim and vigor of this time of

ear.

It is a time when our thoughts are starting to wander
and roam as we are caught up in an increasing feeling of
interest and adventure. As we sit in the library vainly
attempting to write our already overdue term paper, to
solve a slightly complicated calculus computation, or to
study for one of our three tests we have scheduled for the
next day, we can hear the pleasant, melodious chirping of
newly arrived birds —— even over the everpresent low, echo-
ing, coo of the Hawley pigeons.

Since it is still too cool and wet to get a sunbath on
Dorm Field, the gals put back their bikinis and partake
of the pleasant art of taking“ a walk preferably with a
member of the opposite type sex. And since there are
usually a number of these men tooling around, most of
these mechanically minded females have soon cleverly
paired off with one and the happy little twosomes can be
seen floating along all over the campi.

“Play Ball"

But, the more adventurous and hardy of our male
population have felt that annual tug and lure of spring
sports, The bats, balls, and gloves are soon brought out
of winter storage and the slap-slap of several games of
catch can be heard. The whine of a zipping fastball, the
resounding crack of wood against horscliidc, the stinging
smack of a screeching line drive hitting in the glove of a
lunging infielder, and the cheers and shouts of approval
or encouragemerit all blend together to form music‘in an
athlete's or avid sports fan’s ear.

Man. who could help but be happy at a time like
tlust! llut wait, who is that man over there with the long
face? You say it‘s our varsity bascbatl coach. That’s cool,
doesn‘t he know he‘s supposed to be in a good mood now‘.’
0h 1 get it, his favorite major lcaguc team just lost its
tenth game in a row. No that’s not it, hub?) The athletic
department didn‘t buy any new baseball equipment again
this year? No not that either. His son just hit him in the
head with a baseball? Wrong again, OK. I give up, what’s
the problem? ()h 1 see, he‘s trying to field a team, but
he hasn't got. any players. Whew.l for a second I thought
it was something serious.

Enough Joking

_ I But listen Statesmen while this is not exactly the case,
it is still no joke. Thr re are men out for the team, in-
cluding several very good ballplayers, but how many? --—~
twelve. That’s right, only twelve. Even if these were all
excellent ballplaycrs, it is still a mighty small number to
make up any sort of a winning team. and if we are to have
a top squad there will have to be more than this handful
out there on the diamond. Hold on just a second though
before you make that. decision to gch it a try. If you
are the type of guy who prefers taking a mighty swing
at an oversich softball on Dorm Field where all the little
women of Alden, l’icrcc, Bru, and Saylcs can see your
bcautitut wt of Vic 'l‘aiiny Muscles, and you think you'll
gct lots or attention and glory by going out for baseball
. . forget it 9' Only if you like the firm ti'cnicr of getting
a solid ptcr'c of lumber on the ol’ apple, only if you get
:i thrill out of making a good defensive play,‘ and only if
you haw- thc desire to win and the hustle to go all out
to achieve this, ycs only then does State want or need you

“Even in today’s age of specialization, a man eventually
reaches a point where breadth of knowledge is necessary.
The engineer must understand accounting and marketing.
The marketing man must know his product. The financial
man must be sympathetic to engineering development
and sales programs. Management must have a working
knowledge of all phases of the complex and highly com-

petitive business world.

“Therefore, even though specializing, a student should
make his college curriculum as broad as possible, and
diversify his outside activities. Authoritative surveys have
shown that only a small percentage of individuals end up
in the field in which they specialized in college.

"Widen your world. Broaden your interests right now.
Since graduation from college I’ve discovered that those
who are really succeeding today are the ones who do more
and keep on learning from what they do. The broader
your college interests are now ~ the steadier your ladder at.“

of success tomorrow!"

Crow Cops4-l Championship
But Bows in NAIA Tourney;
Hampered by Knee lniury

By DICK ROBELOT’I‘O

Clem Crow, Albany State’s fine, undefeated-in—dual-
matches wrestler, successfully defended his 4—I Tourna—
ment championship. However, while doing so, he sustained
an injury which hampered him the following weekend in
the N.A.1.A. Tournament held in Winona, Minnesota. Ray
Bonchard and John Woytowich, two other consistent wrest-
lers for our team, lost in their respective weight classes.

Ray drew a bye to the semi-finals of this tournament,
but in the semis he met Butler of Western Michigan who
turned the trick and defeated Ray. Ray lost his consola-
tion match to Ricks of Ithaca College. John Woytowich
wrestled the best match of the season when he defeated
Staley Jackson of Howard 8-3 in overtime. John met de-
fcat at the hands of his next opponent Walter Kottmeyer
of Millci‘ville, Pa. A knee injury kept John out of the
consolation match.

Clem, of course. W011 both the prt.-liminaries, the
semis, and the finals. in his two pi'cliins‘. he faced Gary
Jones of Millersburg and Dan Grey of Toledo. both of whom
he dccisiOi'icd. In the semis. Tom Koi-nig of the University
of Illinois fell to Clcrn's wrestling princess. in the finals,
Clem wrestch better than in any other match this season.
l’at lVlcCorn‘iach, his opponent, had scoutcd Clem thorough-
ly and countered almost every move Clciri tried. Forced
into overtime, Clem eventually won 3-0, snapping the Wash-
ington and Jefferson's boy win string at 45. While beating
.\Ict‘orriizich, (.‘lcm injured his knee
and thus hampered any chain-
pionsliip attempt in the .\'..~\.I A.

t‘lcm was able to wrestle in this
toui'nariicnt with a brace on his
knee. However this was too big
an advantage to give to the calibre
of wrestlers that participated in
t h i s tournament. Consequently
Clem lost to Don Taylor of Blooms-
burg in the first round of wrest-
ling. Clcrn was the hard-luck
wrestler of the learn. First he
broke his ankle, next he suffered
an injury to the opposite leg. and
now this. However, even with
these injuries. he was forced to
miss only two matches. llis per-
