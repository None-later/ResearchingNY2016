A Salary to Survive

Student Association budgets have been submitted to
the finance minister and are now being considered by com-
mittees. The State College News budget, which will be dis-
cussed by Senate in two or three weeks, includes a $400
salary for the editor-in-chief. We would like to explain
why we are asking that next year's editor be paid and to
ask the help of the student body in our efforts to have the
salary line accepted.

The salary attached to a position is usually based on
time, responsibility, and training. The position of editor—
in-chief of the State College News consumes enough time.
entails enough responsibility. and requires enough train-
ing to warrant a salary.

The News editor works a minimum of thirty hours a
week on Val‘lOUS phases of the production of your student
newspaper -— besides consuming untold hours worrying
and planning. The position thus requires at least as much
time as the position of SA president does.

livery News editor has a bigger job than the last. for
we. too, are expanding. By 1970 there will be twice as
many State College students as there were in 1960. While
the school population is doubling. the output of the State
College News (if the publication is able to continue) will
be multiplied by four: there will be approximately twelve
pages contrasting with the usual six in 1960, and the paper
will probably be published twice a week. We are now pub-
lishing an average of eight pages a week. Therefore the
News has twice the expansion job of the student govern-
ment: it must plan extensively for the future as well as
function now while it grows.

Although many students do not realiZe it. the editor-
in-chief has an enormous responsibility. He or she is re—
sponsible for not only planning and publishing the paper
but also for its impact long after publication. The (‘Clllﬁ’ii'
is directly responsible for every word. every letter. every
punctuation mark. The responsibilities of Student Asso-
ciation president are much more indirect than these. The
SA president can delegate responsibility; the State (‘ollegc
News editor cannot. Since the school paper is one of the
major factors by which outsiders judge a school. the cdiloi'
of the newspaper has more impact outside the school than
the student government officers do.

One of the main reasons for the great i‘t‘SptilisiliililV
of this editorial position is that there is no faculty or ad-
ministrative advisor. We. are glad to have the opportunity
to make all decisions ourselves. However. since the News
is self—governing. the editor has no one to whom she can
“pass the buck“; you worry a lot more and work a lot harder
when you know you are totally responsible.

More extensive training is required for election to and
fulfillment of the duties of editor-in-chief than for any
other SA office. A candidate must be well informed about
the technical and mechanical aspects of journalism. must
be able to wite well. must have the knowledge and experi-
ence to establish editorial policies. and must be well in-
formed about collegc issues. In general. a candidate must
have been a regular member of the staff“ for at least two
years and a member of Ncws Board for one year. He or
she must have also spent many hours doing extr-i work
and seeking extra knowledge

The most urgent reason for providing a salary for the
State College News editor is that otherwise it may very
soon (perhaps next semester) be impossible to find anyone
who will be able to take the editor‘s job. Incumbent editors
have no more money than anyone else. Those people who
would be eligible for the editorship next semester pist can‘t
afford to give tip one or two part time yobs to fill a position
amounting to a full-time job without pay.

thn a salary was given to the Student Association
prcsidcnt scvcral years ago. it was with the goal of even-
tually granting salaries to more and more collcgc offices
The argument of “Where docs ll stop'” is not valid, for
of course it doesn't stop at least for a long. long time
If our school is so eager to keep up with the "big name"
schools. it should rcalizc that granting a salary to thc
cditor of the News is onc tllttl't' step in approaching llic

slilllflill'tlh of lllt‘St' schools.
