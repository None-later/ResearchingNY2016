State Pushes
Building Fund

Governor Rockefeller recently
announced that his administration
will sponsor legislation to create
a new State. University Construc-
tion Fund to bring about an ac«
celerated program of campus con
struction. The fund would begin
operations May 1.

The governor. at a press con-
ference in New York City. said the
Fund will be a public benefit
corporation with the single pur-
pose of achieving on-time comple-
tion of the $700 million construction
program required by the Univer-
sity's Master Plan for the decade
1960 to 1970.

The Fund would be a separate
agency within the University. Pol-
icy and priority decisions with
regard to construction at the var-
ious units of the University will
be determined by the Board of
Trustees. as in the past.

In effect, the Fund takes the
place of the State Department of
Public Works which. except for
dormitories built by the Dormitory
Authority, has carried out Univer-
sity campus construction.

Under terms of the legislation.
three trustees appointed by the
Governor and approved by the Sen-
ate would direct the Fund. They
would have authority as agent for
the University to design. construct.
acquire and improve all necessary
facilities and to utilize a wide. va-
riety of public and private rc-
s‘ourccs in order to carry out the
assignment.

Medical Association Tries
To Stop Social Legislation

By JOE GALU

The American Medical Associa-
tion is the leading professional or—
ganization for general practitioners
as well as other doctors and sur-
geons.

The political outlook of the or-
ganization is, on the whole, highly
conservative on most issues, while
on some it delves into the fields of
the reactionary.

Opposition To Legislation

As a result of the AMA’s opposi-
tion to the vast majority of recent
social legislation, it has come un-
der attack. The attacks have been
made by the Democratic National
Chairman, John Bailey, many doc-
tors, various liberals, numerous
“Senior Citizen" groups and all the
other groups the AMA has manag-
ed to alienate.

The AMA has alienated many
doctors by its dictatorial policies.
It recently attempted to set up
hospitals which would employ only
doctors who already belong to the
AMA: a court refused to grant
whatever kind of permission was
needed.

Senior citizens groups have been
offended by the group‘s insistence
that Social Security Medical Care.
for the Aged would be socialized
medicine. Socialized medicine in-
fers the ownership by the govern
ment of all hospitals and all inedi-
cal colleges. .‘\‘o proposal has in
cludcd either of these.

The general overall legislative
\iews of the AAIA haw alienated
people who both know the
‘i.\I.-\‘s position and are not right
wing. The AAIA has opposed such
things as the income tax, inheri-
lniit'c taxes. corporation income
tax, federal pure food and drug
regulations and social security.

mean little to me. What means far
more is the action of the AMA with
regard to such problems as mal-
practice and improving the quality
of medical care in America.

The AMA has been ineffective in
eliminating malpractice. Their own
statistics state that 2 % of the mat-
practice is performed by 1% of the
doctors in America. Unlike law-
yers‘ groups, the AMA has not set
up such things as county boards to
certify “good” doctors.

The certificates on a doctor‘s
wall do not say that the doctor is a
good one. It does not say he is a
bad one either. A simple, easy-to-
read certificate, with no Greek or
Latin, from a possible county board
could go far in raising the level of
practice in America, but the AMA
has shown no interest in weeding
out its very few bad seeds.

Doctors, for the most part, are
dedicated people, as are most law-
yers and most school teachers, but
in all three categories there should
be professional action to maintain
a high level of practice and ethics.

The American Medical Associa-
tion refers to American medical
care as the best in the world. This
is their argument for the main-
tainancc of the status quo as far
as state and federal regulation is
concerned.

I do not doubt that medical care
in lllt‘ t'nitcd States is excellent.
but rccciii figures in the Post in»
dicate that we do not lead in all
fields The field where we trail is
[It reducing infant. mortality. The
t'nited Kingdom, Sweden. Norway,
(tcriiiaiiy. and many other Euro-
pean countries have substantially
lower infant mortality rates than
our own. Although it can be com-
pletely a coincidence, most if not
all of the countries with lower in-
fant mortality rates have socialized
medicine. If it is not a coinci»
dcncc. information from the AMA
and other groups which opposed so-
cialized medicine and medicare for
the aged under Social Security has
been misleading.

I listen to arguments botlt in
favor of and against socialized

medicine and the proposed aged
care plan currently before (‘on
gress. The AMA and other groups
always talk about the terrible con—
ditions in countries where they
have socialized medicine. The
question I wish these groups would
answer is “if it‘s so bad why hasn't
a single country repealed socialized

Priscilla Pudge belongs to the

best sorority on campus. I mean,
she really does. They're absolute-
ly top drawer; after all, Priscilla
Pudge wouldn’t be in anything but
a top drawer sorority . . really.

All top drawer sororities have
fabulous weekends. .Iust everyone
dies to be invited. Priscilla asked
her boy friend and he died. They
can’t wait until the weekend to
have. a fabulous time.

Priscilla wouldn't think of sign-
ing out for the weekend. After all,
eleven-thirty-one should be late
enough for any topdrawer person;
and besides. think of the scandal
if Priscilla Pudge (the Priscilla
Pudgc) got caught. There would
be no top drawer pledge-class next
year, and, what is worse, no Pris-
cilla Pudgc to impress them.

Also, girls can do awful things
in A HOTEL. This year nothing
awful will take place because
HOTELS have been eliminated by
the administration.

This year Priscilla plans to have
GOOD CLEAN FUN. An informal
party at the Greyhound Bus Ter-
minal will highlight the first even-
ing’s activities. All couples at-
tending will dress as buses. and
six kinds of soda-pop (with straws!)
will be served. Committee-heads
are - - - (Oh. skip it). Priscilla's
sorority is truly lucky, because
they are ha\ ing '31 chapci'ones (one

for every three girls). \'oihing
awful will happen.

ority is planning an excursion to

the opportunity to ride either a

after a violent discussion at the
last sorority meeting, it was decid-

(rcceeally top-drawer favors) will
be distributed while riding the
camel or elephant.

The formal will be lovely. The
grand ballroom of the Waldorf

the refreshments. Priscilla just
bought a fabulous new dress for the

’Try, Try' Has Questionable Varied A. D. Plays Reveal
Value, but Shows Creativity Originality and Competence

By W. II. EDWARDS

Last Sunday a group of State
students presented two performan-
ccs of a onc-aci play by Frank
0' Ilara. entitled Try, Try, in the
ballroom of the Kenmore Ilotcl.
,lohn \'clic directed: Norma Kurt-
zer. Richard Marshall, and Ted
Pulaski comprised the play's cast.
The following comments are based
on the afternoon performance.

Plot and Theme

Try. Try is a bravura piece for
actors. Its "plot" is an aiiccdoie in
the lives of an unsuccessful writer,
John. and his mistress, Violet.
which is punctuated by the return
from World War II of \'iolct‘s pres
ent husband. Jack. It perhaps ver-
ges on silliness to summarize Try.
Try in terms of the theme; but for
those who like a breathless sum»
mary: “the disillusioning and dcm-
oralizing effects of post-war life on
two people with each onc's consc-
qucnt desire to make life hell for
the other."

Mr. ()‘llara has
bravura along with
to be an all-too-ofien incrctriciis
loading of the actors' lines with
candy imiges and flashy spines of
the Alexander King variety. such
as "Your smile was like pink
irinolnic going through a ringer."

Try, Try was overly apparent, and
any subtlety that the play might
have was lost. Yet, judging from
one look at the performance of the
cast and several readings of the
script. I think that the play does
as well as it can as a virtuoso
piece.

Setting

Perhaps the interior of the Keit-
more Ballroom is beautiful when
it is used for dancing, but under
Mr, \’elie‘s dim house lights and
spare lighting plot. it took on
enough of a seedy aspect to create
the marvelous illusion that arena
set and ballroom theatre were not
contiguous but continuous. It was
hard to tell. particularly at the
rear of what might more aptly be
called artfully placed debris than
“set.” where the ballroom began
and the set left off. In at least two
sons‘rs. the ballroom became the
set

Value

In addition to the fact that the
proceeds of Try, Try went toward
the support of “suppression,” the
larger \'alnc of last Sunday's pro-
duction was unquestionable. The
knowledge that State students such
as .\|r \‘chc and his staff have
enough dedication to leash disasso-
t‘lIllttl I‘l't'.’lll\f‘ cili'l‘gy to tile for-
and discipline of a dramatic pro-

cli iii 'o Illli‘lii 'i-iicc

By DONALD dc It‘ANO

An overflow crowd of almost 100
squeezed into Richardson’s Little
Theater on Wednesday evening to
witness the first offering of this
semester‘s class in Advanced Dra-
matics.

The Clouds

The first presentation was a
Robert Shelford adaption of Aris-
tophane’s The Clouds. Despite the
stunning personifications of the
clouds (breathless Sandra Kchoe
and Mary Robb) and the charming
struggle between Right and Wrong
Logic (Gloria Avener and Patricia
James) the play never amounted
to anything more than a well or-
ganized skit. The in-group claquc,
which roared at each Sam Singer
twitch and died from hilarity ever
time Dick Nottingham rolled his
effcte Socratic eyes, attracted al-
most as much curiosity front the
audience as did the actors on-stagc.
In sum, Anne Smith's handiwork
was kind of fun, but pretty "'cak
theater.

Blood Wedding

Next came the best presentation
of the evening: Act III, Scene I
of Garcia Ilorca‘s Blood Wedding.
Director Ilarriet Berbcry display-
ed dolicate taste drawing together
elements of stagccrafi and block-
ing to create a single totality of
effect. Perhaps Bob \t'illower‘s
choriuigraphy was c\('cssi\‘c, but
if so it was a minor fault. liillian
Schmidt as lllt' Beggar Woman
revealed a surprising depth of
lalciit. and the brief nppcaiuincc ol

only for its brevity. The rest of
the acting was even and appro-
priatc to the poignantly beautiful
mood of the play. As the final
curtain closed it was obvious that
the audience appreciation was
sincere.
He Who Says Yes .

Bertolt Brecht's He Who Says
Yes, He Who Says No was pres-
cntcd after the intermission. Di-
rected by Ingeborg (loetze, the
play suffered from a conflict be-
tween theatrical style and content.
Firmly didactic in nature. the
universal import of the play, name-
ly that tradition is not to be held
above question and change—awith
all the political and social impli-
cations of that mandate — is as
significant today as it was when
Brecht wrote it. But the staging
of this play with the obvious inten-
tion of distancing the actors by
deliberately positing them in a
"play" had the result of confusing
the audience by drawing attention
to theatrical effects and away from
personal thought involvement. Exs
cepting this general objection to
the presentation. the effect of the
play was firm. Dick Rogers turn-
cd in another calm, efficient pcr-
foi‘mancc. and Douglas Ross was
lllllll't‘:Sl\'t' as the Chorus.

The Sandbox

lloiincc Scott‘s production of The
Sandbox by Edward Albee was
something of a disappointment. It
s a delightful vehicle but it never
quite came alive. llarry tiny and
lan Let“. were excellent as Albee
"types." The absolute superficial-
.‘y of their rcspcctive characters.
so iicccssary to structure of the
play. was perhaps the quality not
sufficiently attained by the women.
The play had its moments, how
c\‘cl‘. and the audience reception
indicated that there is a place at
State College for Absurd ’I‘hcalcr,

Movie Reviews

By PAUL JENSEN

The title of the play The Miracle
Worker refers to Annie Sullivan.
who released the young I-Ielen Kel-
ler from the cage in which she had
been imprisoned soon after birth.
Deaf, dumb, and blind, Helen mere-
ly existed within this shell, ig-
norant of the world with which she
was unable to communicate. Wil-
liam Gibson, however, as author of
the play, might also be credited
with a miracle of sorts: from this
dark and somber material he has
fashioned a humorous, exciting, and
thoroughly satisfying theatrical ex-
pcrience.

The humor in the play, which was
presented at the Strand Theatre
on March 22, is welcome, and does
not appear out of place. Most of
it, although not all, seems spon-
taneous, arising naturally from the
situations and characters. There is
a great deal of physical action in
the play, highlighted by several ex-
citing free-for-alls between Annie
and Helen.

The two lead roles were excel—
lently done. Eileen Brennan suc-
ceeded in creating a three-dimen-
siona‘ portrait of the outspoken,
Irish teacher who showed Helen
what a word was; Donna Zimmer-
man, in the difficult role of Ilelen,
effectively projected botli the phy-
sical and mental sides of her handi-
cap. Unable to see, hear. or speak,
she could only gropc about. uttering
pitcous groaning sounds. This phy-
sical disability was obvious. but we
saw. in addition. the grouping that
must have been taking place in
the darkness ol her mind.

Although the ~upporting cast was
coinj’iclcnt. the actors occasionally
slipped into stock cliai'actcriza»
lions. t‘ .\l. (‘amplc’s Captain
lv'cllcr. and Thomas t‘onnolly as
Ilclcn‘s' older brother James. were
the main offenders. The former
sometimes reverted to the stereo
typed Proud Southerner with a con-
descending attitude toward the
.‘\'o’th, while Mr. (.‘onnolly now and
then gave us the familiar Young
Alan with the (‘ynical \'icwpoint.

This defect is nearly negligible.
however, when compared with the
fine performances of the principals,
and the cxccllcnt story. These two
elements have combined to create
a play which is both serious and

 

entertaining. an uncommon com-
bination.
