Library Dept.
Meets at Bru

The “Library Man Power Con.
ference” was held on April 4-5 at
Brubacher Hall. The conference is
sponsored by the Division of Li-
brary Science, State University
College at Albany.

The moderators of the three ses-
sions were: Irving C. Verschoor.
Director of Librarianship, State
College: Harold W. Tucker, Chief
Librarian, Queens Borough Public
Library: and Hugh M. Flick, Asso-
ciate Commissioner ot' the New
York State Education Department.

Dr. Evan R. Collins, President
of State College. delivered the
welcoming speech. The conference
considered such topics as “Mam
power Problems and Programs in
College and University Libraries,”
"Personnel Implications in Refer-
ence and Research." and “What
Are the Personnel Needs in School
Libraries.”

Goals of the Conference

There has been a rapid growth
of" library systems in New York
State since 1958. This renaissance
of library service has created prob-
lems of obtaining qualified person-
nel. The establishment of a coordin-
ated pattern of reference and re-
search library service will require
ii small number of librarians and
technicians trained in newer con-
ctpis of library service.

The impact of regional rcsearclt
and reference library systems on
existing college and universities.
as well as special libraries, will
necessitate changes in procedures
and practices among librarians
which will increase the need for re-
fresher training. At the conference
specialists in various areas of Ii-
brarianship presented some of the
elements of the manpower prob-
lem so that possible solufions could
bi- suggested and (ll-it'llSst‘fI.

Four State Women Attend
Penn State Student Conclave

By MICK] EIIRENKONIG

Recently Penny Grasdorf, Sandra
Kehoc, Bev Iloestery and I found
ourselves in the midst of 300 other
girls representing some 66 various
colleges in the Northeast. At, this
convention of the Intercollegiate
Association of Women Students we
exchanged ideas of mutual campus
problems.

Why didn't sororities have later
hours for their infortnal parties?
The blame rests with every girl in
each of the sororities. These girls
fail to support the Residence Coun-
cil so that its voice will be heard
along with that of thc housemolh-
crs when the administration was
willing to listen.

House Rules

llousc signotil sheets are seein-
ineg ineffective. Complaints are
heard about girls‘ curfews. We
don't mind having a curfew, but is
everyone satisfied with t h e s 0
hours'.‘ It is unfair that because of
certain “catch clauses" in dormi-
tory regulations sotne violators are
favored over others. flow is it. that
ill some dorms conditions so exist
that thc houseinothcr has complete
say with house officers only in ex-
istcncc as a pttppct government'.‘

llousc officers arc responsible
pcoplc clccted to \’tll('t' the coin-
pliitnts of the residents whom they
represent. Why aren't they allowed
to do this'.‘ We respect the duty of
the houscmofhers and college ad-
ministration to live up to the term,
“in loco pai'ciitis" tin place of par-
entst. Ilowcyer, can‘t we talk over

and discuss oiit' problems willi
these pcoplc'.’

Ideas Presented

At the conference a few out-
standing ideas were presented by
such key speakers as Dr. Edward
Eddy. President of ('hatham Col-
lege. In the 1950‘s. college students
were in a state of apathy. ’l‘he
l9titl‘s, along with the election of a
vigorous young president, has sup-
poscdly brought about a revitaliza-
tion of student interest on Ameri-
can campuses. Sometimes I won-
der what happened to State stit-
dents? I hear students with a mile
long list. of complaints about how
our college is rtin, and yet these
same students never seem to leave
their dorm rootn card games ex‘
cop! to go down to dinner. Are you
so selfish that you won't work for
anything unless it has an immedi-
ate affect on you'.’ Less apathy and
more intelligent action will cut
down the items from this list.

Press Bureau

James Conklin ’63, Minister of
Communications, announces that
Sally lIcaly ’64 has been appoint~
ed as (‘o-Chairman of Press Bu-
reau to work with Chairman Toni
Vianesc ’63.

The activities of Press Bureau
have been expanded and reactiv-
ated in order to increase publicity
of State College and the students at
the college. The group has been
working with Dr. Carrino, the As-
sistant to the President; Dr.
'l‘horne, Dean of Men; and other
administrators planning the pro
gram.

Interest in this group has appar-
ently dwindled somewhat during
the past few years, but it is hoped
that the addition of Miss flealy to
the staff will give some impetus to
the group. With the expansion of
activities, more students are need-
ed and a campaign to increase
membership will be initiated soon.

Sally has participated in many
activities including the Committee
on Improvement of Greek Organ-
izations, and the Student Anti—Tui-
tion Delegation in the Capitol. She
has recently joined the State Col-
lege News atid is on the Committee
for Parents Day next November.

Not Enough Action

By KENNETH BRADY

'I'he \iitional I‘Zducation Associa-
tion was founded in 1857 “to elevate
the character atid advance the in-
terests of the profession of teach-
ing "

Members of the NI'IA include
classroom teachers, professors, ad-
ministrators, and specialists in the
schools and colleges of the United
States, llowcvcr, the NICA was
founded by school administrators
and lia~ always been dominated by
them.

The NEA can never possibly rep—
resent the economic interests of its
teacher in c m b c r s. As Msgr.
George lliggins wrote: “The obvi
ous answer is that the NRA from
the point of view of tile economics
of the teaching profession is the
equivalent of a company union."

Salary Crumbs

the NRA has not earnestly cone

stdcrcd the salary and welfare
problems of the teacher. Instead,
the Association has been content

with salary crttinbs, panaceas. apv

The NRA just has not doiic the
job. What teachers need is a strong
organization that will help them to
raise the standards of the teach
ing profession by securing the con—
ditions essential to tile best pro-
fessional service. The American
I"cder.'ition of T c a c h c r s, aii af-
filiate of the AFLt'It). is such an
organization.

The AF'l‘ is ol. by and for class-
room teachers in public schools
and colleges. School aiid college
administrators may not belong.

Uiiprof'essional

'l‘he NI‘IA, seeking to become the
dominant organization in the field
of American Education, has always
been unsympathetic, if not opposed.
to the organization of teachers into
a union such as the American Fed~
cration of Teachers. The NRA
maintains that the Ali‘T’s emphasis
oii teacher welfare is “unprofes-
sional.” Other members of the
Association contend that the goals
of American Labor are not har—
monious with the goals of Ameri-
can l'Iducation. But when exa-
mined objectively. these statements
are found to bc fallticious.

Actors. writers. and concert arr
ists can testify to the value of
unions for professionals. So can
noooo teachers

"We do not low our dignity nor
our scholarship by ioining the
American I"('tlt‘I‘tllltiIi of 'l'cttchers,”
said Senator Paul II Douglas
"Rather \vc increase the effective-
ness and our ability to act collec»
lively for the common welfare."

Secondly. orgatti‘icd labor has
always been friendly to American
Education. For example, the AM.-
('It) is currently supporting and
actively working for adequate
tcachcr tenure laws. accumulative
sick leave pay. hospitalization and
medical insurance. and fttll profcs
sional status for teachers

The Al"'l' has i‘cpcatcdly won bcl«

conditions for its members. after
the Nlu‘A IlfltI failed to accomplish

Movie Reviews

By PAUL J E NSEN

The Children‘s ﬂour is for chil-
dren. At any rate, it should not
be seen by any adult of at least
average intelligence: the film. pre-
scntcd last week at the Strand
'l‘heatt r, has practically nothing
original about it. Its thesis, that
malicious gossip can ruin a per-
son‘s life, has been disinterred iii-
numcrablc titncs over the years.
It has been used in everything
from the cheapest soap opera to
fine films such as One. Foot. in
Heaven. 'l’he topic of the gossip.
Lesbianisin. is rather new to the
screen, however. This innovation
was probably expected to raise the
uttdienccs' interest; instead it stir-
prisingly, and completely. fails to
do anything of the sort.

The plot. if it is worth mention-
tiig, concerns a disgusting little
girl who. otit of spite and sheer
perversity. tells her grandmother
(li‘ay Rainier) that the two women
who rtiii the boarding school she
attends arc unnaturally attached to
each other. The immediate result
is that every child is withdrawn
from the school; the eventual re-
sult is lliat Shirley MacLiiinc, one
of the women. hangs herself. In
addition Andrew llepburn. the other

victim, convinces her fiance that
he must leave her.

Cry, The Beloved Hypocrite

By JOE GALU

Benny (Kid) l’eret was the Wel-
terweight (157-159) Champion of
the world. He became the first
boxer to lose his life in a chain»
pionship bout.

.:i the past three years, men
have died in all three levels of
boxing within this state. When

two white men, one in a high school
and one in a college, (lied, there
was no cry for an investigation.
Last ’I‘uestlay. a t'uban died. Ilis
oppoiictit was it Negro. This is an
election year, and our political
leaders all want an investigation.

Various self'emadc experts de-
mand that boxing should be abolish-
ed, that boxers should wear head-
gear, that there should be lighter
medical checks, and that referees
should have tighter qualifications.

Constructive Work Ignored

There are many sincere people
who realize the need for the im-
provement of equipment and regu—
lations used in all sports. Many
of these pcoplt have worked for
uniform state t [Uiplllt‘lll standards
for football 'l‘hcy point out that
Zti high school football players were
killed last year.

These same people cannot help
but be sicketictl by the headline
seekers who will occasionally pull
their heads away from their usual
complacency to condemn a sport
during a "crisis."

N. Y. Actions

The fight took place iii New
York's Madison Square (fardcn uti—
der the rules and regulations as
set tip by the New York State Ath-
lclic Commission and the liegislii
iurc.

‘I'hcrc w a s an investigation.
lCmtle til'lililll, the new cltainpion,
his managers and l’arcl’s manager
were tiol questioned The investi-
gation ended in ii while-wash for
all state appointees.

New York Statc is one of the
worst in the cntirc nation as far
its boxing laws are concerned: the
mobsters i'ulcd and still riilc box
my under our current state laws.

\\hcn Iiiiitctl States Senator l'Istcs
lvt-tttttvcr (ll-'l'cnncsscct liiitl an
it.\t-sttvalioii of boxing and showed

the weakness of New York State
laws, he was called a political 0p-
portunist by those legislators who
support investigations in this elec-
tion year.

Politics

I feel nothing but revulsion with
the entire affair. New York State
has never been interested enough
in boxing to eliminate mobster rule
of boxing. I can see nothing but
political lianky-panky in all current
actions.

New York State will not tighten
regulations on boxing. There will
be no new laws of a constructive
nature; no law to set age limits
on boxers; no law to tighten med-
ical checks on boxers; no law to
eliminate corruption from the big
business of boxing; no laws to im-
prove what is often a “good”
sport.

Weak State Laws

The same way otir infant indus-
tries became monopolies and trusts
through the protection of a tariff,
boxing corruption has grown from
the exception to the general rule
with the aid and assistance of
New York State laws.

I do
dividual

not have to name the in
mobsters who have ruled
boxing When the king pins are
caught. it is the federal govern-
tncnl which has done the catching.
l'sually the critnc which catches
the mobster is income tax evasion:
it‘s sort of" ironic that the only
reason these corruptors are impri-
soned is because they do not pay
correct and legal taxes on their
ill-gotten gains.

Special Session?

The hypocrisy which has been
shown on this issue has been noth-
ing short of amazing. If Rocke—
feller wanted action, he could do-
clare that an emergency existed
and call a special session of the
legislature. Republican lawmakers
would think twice before opposing
their leader under the spotlights
of a special session and of an elec-
tion year I fear the hypocrisy of
oiit' political leaders will be shown
by the lack of it special session
