Frank & Fear Top Twosome

In Bowling Doubles Tourney;
Sabo & Thorpe Runners Up

Claude Frank and Don Fear won
the AMIA Doubles Tournament
held at Schade’s Academy for the
last two weeks. Frank's and Fear’s
winning total was 2254. Runner-up
to the winners were Al Sabo and
Joe Thorpe with a total of 2222.
The third place team was Bill Bra-
nick and Pete Peltz with 2220, fin-
ishing only two pins behind the sec-
ond place team.

The tournament was on a handi-
cap basis — the difference between
each bowler's average and 180. For
instance, A1 Sabo's average was
172 during the season. Since the
handicap was based on 180, Al‘s
would be eight pins a game. This
would be a 100"; handicap. But
the tournament was run on a 2 3
handicap, which means Sabo‘s was
only 5 1/3 pins a game. or 16 pins
for three games. Every bowier‘s
handicap was figured in this way.

After the first week of bowling
Jim McAden and Dave Crystal
were in first place with 1142, fol-
lowed by Felix and Branick with
an 1127, Thorpe and Sabo with 1125,
Milewski and Jablon with 1115, and
Frank and Fear with 1105. flow-
ever, the standings changed some-
what at the end of the second week.
McAden and Crystal wound tip
seventh, Peltz and Branick third,
Thorpe and Sabo second, Milewski
and Jabion fourth. and Frank and
Fear first.

Frank's spectacular bowling was
responsible for his and his partner‘s
first place finish. ('Iaude bowled
series of 573 and 592, for a six game
average of 191 »— best in the tour-

nament. Thorpe’s outstanding bowi-
ing was responsible for his and his
partner’s second place finish. Joe
hit series of 599 and 510 for a 184
average. In addition Joe had high
handicap triple, 647, high scratch
triple, 599, second high scratch sin-
gle with 224, and second high band
icap single with 249.

Bill Trtimp had high handicap
single for the tournament with a
2-12 (221 with a handicap of 21).
Runner-up was Thorpe with 240
(224 with a handicap of 16). Bra-
nick finished third with a 222 (202
with a handicap of 20). Finishing
runner-up to Thorpe in the high
triple department was Mert Suther-
land with a 602 (526 with a handi-
cap of 76). Finishing third was
John Liiga with 601 (567 with a
handicap of 34).

In the s c r a t c h department
(scratch, meaning bare score with-
out handicap) Frank had high sin-
gle with 229, followed by Thorpe
with 224, and Trump with 221. 111in
triple went to Thorpe with 599, fol-
lowed by Frank with 592, and Lilga
with 567.

Touching All
Bases

By DAVE JENKS

 

While swishing by the bulletin board near the men‘s
locker the other day, my attention was caught by a new
shiney piece of paper tacked up there among the usual rub-
ble. Not having seen it before, I made an abrupt left, knock-
ed over two girls, a janitor and some little ol‘ lady, approach-
ed the board, and began to read. “It is now do or die! !——for
track at Albany State. All those who wish to participate
should pick up a form from Mr. Munsey in the Housing
Office.” Ah Hat! This was good news, somebody was really
getting on the ball and organizing another sport to make
our athletic program here at State a more well-rounded
one. I figured that it would be a wise idea to interv1ew
this fellow and see what the track future might hold in
store.

If I had known how hard it was to get a hold of this
man, I probably would have decided to forget it right then
and there. But I did not know; so I proceeded to his office
where I was met by his efficient little secretary. I asked
if he were in, and she kindly informed me that he would be
gone all day.

A SCN Writer Always Gets His Man

Several days of futile attempts to locate him and I was
about ready to give up, but suddenly I got my chance. I
saw our man with the built—in soup strainer jogging along
by the registrar’s office, and like a shot I was off. Spinning
around three professors, I straight—armed Dean Derringer.
cleverly side-stepped a cross~body block by Minerva. and
finally nailed him with a beautiful shoe string tackle as
he tried to escape out the front door of Draper. Nothing
like putting enthusiasm in your work I always say.

Any how. after we both recovered sufficiently, I was
able to get a few bits of info on the track situation before
he was up and off again. While it is now on a temporary
(I hope) Intramural program, there are 20-25 hardy men
out practicing nightly on Vet’s Field. Standouts so far are
T0111 Robinson, Dennis Tuttle, Harold Hansen, Chuck
Hunter and Bob Ward. Tom was our cross-country star of
last fall and promises to do exceptionally well in the dis—
tance runs. Dennis Tuttle is also a distance man is sup—
posed to litth run a 4:38 mile in high school. Chuck
Hunter was also a member of the cross-cmtntry team: and
if he keeps putting in the hard work he is now, he should
do well. Mr. Hansen is the pleasant surprise of the team.
He has never run organized track before in his life, but in
has a very natural stride and may do great. Bob Ward is
It married man in his thnties and is very serious about
doing well in this sport. He is said to have run a 2116.9
huff illllt‘.

It is really great seeing these guys putting the push
behind the track team movement, but they can not do it
alone.

rl‘hcrc are a few essentials if we are to have a track
team now or ever. First of all, more than these 25 men
must have the desire and eagerness to make the team a
reality. Secondly there is our old ncinis again  facilities.
Cramped Vet‘s Field is no place for a squad to work out.
but realizing the enthusiasm for track that is bubbling
in our great city, the City of Albany has generously spread
out through its vast territory one track (Blocker, which is
usually free for our use between 1 and 3 am) Actually
facilities for otir own use will not be ready until the mch
is made to the new campus. The third thing is a full time
coach or at least a regular experienced one. Mr. Munscv

Coach Sauers Reaches Semis
In New York Handball Tourney

Alibany Slate's versatile basket-
ball coacli, Dick Sauers, has once
again made the headlines, htit this
time not because of his abilities as
a basketball mentor. 'l‘he sincwy,
athletic-looking coach reached the
semi-finals of the Northeast New
York YMCA singles handball tour-
nament held at the Albany 
There he was edged out by Nick
Rocco of Schenectady for one of
the berths in the finals.

Sauers Gains Semi-Finals

(taming a first round bye, Dick
defeated 'l‘ony t‘alvagiio of Sche<
nectady, 21-26, 21-15, and then zip-
pcd by .\likc Vincctotc, 21-16, 9-21,
and 21-16 to gain the Quarter-
fiiiais.

In this match Sailors came up
against an extremely tough oppon-
ent in the person of Ed Agrcsto,
another Schenectary titan. btit
using his great stamina, he finally

wore him down to gain the victory.

In the semi-finals, however, it
was a different story. State’s coach
was unable to use his excellent
physical condition as he was quick-
ly over-powered by Nick Rocco in
two straight games.

The unusual side to this story
is that the titan Sauers beat in the
quarter—finals, Ed Agresto, is con-
sidered a better player than Rocco
and beats him consistently.

Second Game I’roves Vital

Sauers feels that if he had been
able to capture the second game
of the semifinal match, he could
probably have beaten Rocco in
the third and final game. Rocco
was beginning to weaken, forcing
many of his shots in an attempt
to quickly overpower Dick, and
if Sauers could have held on enough
to eke out a victory in this game,
he could have outlasted Rocco and
Lhe last game would have been

It is also amazing that the
young Sauers does so well consid-
ering that handball is a very tricky
game which takes a long time to
learn and in which most players
don't hit their prime until around
the age of 40.
