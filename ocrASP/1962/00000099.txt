Rienow Wins
Award, Sees
Items Printed

Dr. Robert Rienow, Professor of
Political Science, has had two
articles reprinted in periodicals and
has received an award from the
National Guard.

The featured article in the April
issue of The Rotarian is a piece
entitled “The Troubled Seas” by
Dr. ltienow and his wife, Leona
Rienow. It deals with basic prob-
lems of jurisdiction.

Alumni Publications of New
York City has recently issued a
pamphlet for industrial distribu-
tion called "The Day the ’l‘aps Run
Dry” which is an updated version
of an article appearing in llarpers
which was written by Dr. and Mrs.
Rienow.

At a special ceremony in Sche-
nectady Colonel Rienow received a
plaque on behalf of his National
Guard unit from Brigadier (ten-
eral Charles G. Stevenson, the Ad-
jutant General of the State of New
York and Vice Chief of Staff to the
Governor. The award was in rec-
ognition of a superior rating at the
latest regular army inspection. The
Selective Service section of the
state headquarters of the New York
National Guard has received twelve
successive annual ratings of stip-
crior.

forward: new areas of concentra~
tion within the current doctoral
program in educational administra-

viewed; and the formulation of
doctoral programs in English Lit-

completion.

Kate’ Dances Lightly Over Page Stage
State Revue Cast Faces Footlights

in Opening of Cole Porter's ‘Kate';
Steinhauer Directs for Third Year

By FREDERICK SMITH
State College Revue, the single production at State College which is completely
organized andpresented by the students, will present, Kiss Me, Kate, at 8 p.m. tonight
and Saturday in Page Hall. The satirical musical comedy opened to a capacity crowd
last evening in Page. i
_‘ Kiss Me, Kate, with musical score by Cole Porter and script by Samuel and Bella
Spewack, tirst opened at New York’s Century Theater in 1948. Since then, Kate has
successfully met the challenge in New York and on the road, both in this country and
many foreign nations. '
The story is a backstage and out-front story about a vatiiglorious actor and his
temperamental ex-wit'e who are starring in a revival of The Taming of The Shrew in
unappreciative Baltimore. The scene shifts from the stage of" a Baltimore theatre to
dressing rooms and backstage reA
hearsal rooms and passages. ’l‘hc
iiitisic has been described as some-
thing to make a l’ttritan want to
start shuffling his feet in rhythtn.
 Once again the ltevue will be di-
_.,:,'  rectcd by the masterful Robert
Steinhauci‘. Bob, winner of a drama
award for acting at the High School
of Performing Arts iii New York
t'ity. is directing his third Revue.
After successfully directing his
class itivalry skits, Bob went on to
direct (iuys and Dolls and last
year‘s itctue. The King and I, The
talents of Stciitliaucr will be sadly
tiliSSt‘tl when iic graduates this
June
