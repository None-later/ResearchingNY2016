Second-semester rushing,

lege campus, where social contacts tend to be close and

often confining.

system? Is a simple

against the inevitable ‘

tee that freshmen will receive an
te's sororities and also be kept free
165 tactics, a strict system of enforce—
ed. Who is willing to set up such a
“honor system" enough to guard
‘dirty-rushing” which has already

become a thorn in the side of our past rushing periods?

A political factor

ing picture. Will elec .
a sorority, and will everyone strive to be a “political wrn-
ner” merely to become a “hot” rushing prospect? Sororities
may also use elections as a tool to attract freshmen. A
star—studded roster of newly elected school officers could
easily be turned into a rushing asset for a sorority.

With such a long
class, sororities will if

is also bound to enter into the rush—
tions be used as a stepping stone to

time to “look over" the freshman
kely tend to make their “crucial”

rushing decisions before rushing even begins. Is this a fair
basis on which to begin rushing?

If all people concerned make a conscious effort to
realize whatever benefits second-semester rushing may
bring in the way of freshman “adjustment” instead of sim-
ply listing them as a means of gaining an end, the pro—

gram might be of merit
ing conduct, however,

Considering past sorority rush-
even the second-semester system

could become another campus headache unless an organ-
ized effort is made to correct its abuses before they begin.

Focus
on Faculty

By JOAN ASFOURY

The English Department at State
College offers a number of enter-
taining and unusual personalities.
The last English Evening, “beat
poetry." confirmed this fact. The
panel. ranging from the very con-

servative to the liberal, arouscdi

mixcd sentiments. Mr. Thomson
Littleficld presented many of his
more liberal views.

He supported the beat movement
because he feels that people con—
demn it only because it is new.
Their opinions are based on an
irrational fear of the unfamiliar
rather than a rational analysis of
the work as literature; the. author's
bizarre living habits are considered
in the evaluation of his work. He
believes that all art should be judg—
ed obiectively, solely on its own
merit, with every consideration
given to that which is unusual and
creative. lie considers “the cour-
age to be new something we
shouldn‘t sneer at."

Mr. Littlefield also supports the
right of the minority. He quotes
Thoreau: “A single right thinking
man is a majority of one.“ For ex—
ample, although he is not sympa-
thetic with the White Southern at-
titude toward the Negro, be con—
siders the (‘atholic Church undem-
ocratic in threatening to excommu-
nicate its members for refusing to
integrate.

Interest in State College
Mr. Littlefield‘s prime interest
lies in the creative efforts of State
('ollcgc. He considers the State
('ollcgc Theatre and the ltcvuc suf
ficicnl evidence of the creative tal-
ent we are supposedly lacking.

llc finds suppression also indica»
five of the attraction for the avant-
garde, calling it “the greatest thing
to hit the campus." Not only has
it offered publication to many sc—
lcctions that would have gone un-
noticed. but it has given the State
(‘ollcgc News a much needed push
in ii literary direction. He sees a
greater coverage of creative cvents
balancing the straight news stories
which formerly made the paper
dull reading.

Realizing the need for staff mcnr

bcrs, Mr. Littlcficld strongly advo

caics a salary tioi only for the office
of ctliior, btit also for other respon-
sible, time-consuming positions. He
feels in this way talented students
would be encouraged to join the
paper as freshmen with the idea of
working toward the top salaried
positions.

Tuition

(‘onccrning the controversy over
luiilon. Mr. Littlcf‘icld belicvcs that
financial incentive should be given
to those entering the teaching pro-
gram. However, he considers rc~
troactivc tuition unfair for those
now changing it) liberal arts These
students should he required to pay
only from the tinn- fhcy enter the
liberal arts program in the fall. in
future years, howcwr, the bbcral
arts degree must require four
years’ tuition to pl'f'Vl'lll siudcnts
from avoiding two years tuition by
changing programs in midstream.

Mr. Lifilcficld believes the prob-
lem could be solved by offering
financial incentive to those excep-
tionally creative imtl intelligent
students in the liberal arts pro-
gram. in this way, even if tuition
were someday extended to the
teaching program, financial aid
would insure the deserving of an
education.

In light of the views given, per-
haps Mr. liittlefield’s stand English
Evening is more understandable.

The suppression f.‘ontroversy

To the Editor:

Clearly tltc editors of suppression
deserved sharp criticism for mak-
ing unsupported charges against
the local police of being typically
efficient in enforcing parking vio-
lations around the campus. A
trouncing was in ortlcr for the
printing of the ill-thought-out state-
ments. What was called for were
vigorous letters of protest to sup»
pression iisclf denouncing the ir-
responsibility of making su c
charges without presenting or hav-
ing the evidence that would back
them tip.

What was not called for was the
disturbing spectacle of a small
group of students. claiming to rep-
rcscnt ihc student hotly, going with
fanfare before the mayor and the
chief of police to apologize for
the school and to make very clear
it) the authorities that suppression
is not an official publication of the
collccc and that it did iioi spciik
for the siiidcni body.

Who but ilic mos) superficial of
llllt‘r])l‘t'll‘l'\ would c \' c r have
thought that it did'.’ l'Iditors don't
"I‘cprcscnt" their intended readers
The city officials should be ac-
corded the respect of assuming. iiol
only that they comprehend this
simple truth, bill also that they
are aware that student publications
are a part of the educational pro—
cess: a laboratory in which stu—
dents risk uniting ideas before their
fellow students. and pay for thc
short-Comings oi ihcsc ideas (if
they are lucky) by suffering the
criticisms of their colleagues. It
is a journalistic form of Socratic
dialogue, and can function as a
particularly efficacious one.

However, its \vcllfunctioning de-
pends in very great measure on
there flourishing within the sin»
dcnl body a l'ccling that risking
ideas is ll\l'll .‘l good thing. dcs-
pilc -i|l|fl t'\l'll bccuusc of) smut“

fallingson-thc-facc. A healthy will-
ingness to run risks in proposing
ideas can only exist where the chief
penalty incurred by offering an ill-
formed idea is having it cast out by
a better one. When for this cath-
arsis there is substituted (by what-
ever subtle and unintended means)
heavy group or authoritarian pres»
sures of condemnation (moral,
aesthetic, or other), the impetus to
venture ideas is almost certain to
be damaged.

The voluntary efforts of tile cdl-
iors of suppression to maintain at
the college ii weekly publication
incdinm providing stimulation and
constantly open opportunities to
students to express their ideas dc-
scrvc student amircciiifion anti sup
port. it should be expected that
there will be an occasional f'aux
pus, especially when the deadlines
are unrelentineg frequent and so
few are doing so much of the work.

This does not cxoncrutc the
guilty from their error, btii i hope
it suggests a more adequate pcrsv
pcciivc on it.

And also on that other action
let the try to spell out why i liiid
that disturbing. for it is easy to
confuse the good with the fillt‘slliili-
iiblc act hcrc, bill of prime impor
iancc, to be able to rccogm/c llll'
difference.

l'm not. of course. obiccting to
individual students. or clearly dclc
hulcd spokesmen for a group. cxr
pressing their own views anti iak
ing initiative to rectify the pos
slblc ill effects of irresponsible ac-
tions of their colli‘ngtics This is
commendable. What 1 am dis-
turbed about arc the indications
that there are some darker strands
ill the motivation of llic action. in
the spirit bchind it; anti l‘m one.»
iioning the apprtmrialcnt-ss of this
particular action under lllt' circum
stances.

At least to this obscru-r thcrc
seemed to be a disconcerting lack
of proportion between the original
sin and ilic ilt'l of rectification. in
attempting to promote a worthy
cause, the editors of suppression

goofcd. 1 see nothing to suggest
either moral perversity or general
irresponsibility in the action: such
slips occur occasionally even to
those who are most stalwart of
character and have the benefit of
greater experience. But this par-
ticular slip bc mute the occasion for
other students to make clamorous
proclamations of sclf-rigliieousncss
and indulge in self-conscious acts
of honor. “The lady protcsicth too
much." Such a noisy clanking of
the machinery of virtue over such
a vcnial sin leads the observer to
ponder the possibility that the
drama has deeper and darker
roots:

(1) Was this a manifestation of
a college neurosis of insecurity
ovci‘ its own image"

(2) Does this suggest an oven
t'egimcntation of feeling and res-
ponse on the campus. an overpas-
sivcncss before group or other pres-
surcs'.’ A small group. without the
backing of a referendum. yields to
the feeling that it ought to. and

The presence of any one of llicsc
animations would clearly raisc a
much llltil‘f' St'l‘ltills ethical nut-s

William V. Grimes.

To the Editor:

All Freshmen are given a hand-
book which contains the Consti-
tution of the Student Association.
Article V of this document con-
tains a description of the college's
“Judicial Department . . known
as Myskania.” The “duties and
powers" of this organization are
stated clearly as follows:

i. To interpret the Studem As-

sociiilion Constitution.

2. To try all impeachment cases.

ll. To act as a court of appeal.

i. To consider cases of unusual

nature referred to it by any
group.

f) To assumc guardianship of the

l~'rcshmcn class.

The emphasis lll ihcsc statements
is. as it ought to be, oil the inter-
prclaiivc duties of Myskanin. .ludi»
cial bodies must limit themselves
to evaluation and i‘cComincndaiion,
and abstain from overt action.

The reason for this is made
oimotu by the absurd Misting
situation: any group of students
who wish a judgment L‘t)llct.'l‘lilIlL‘,
lllt' propriety (not to mention the
constitutional lcgaliiy) of the My»
kamu visit to the Mayor find that
tin-y have no recourse. SUVL’ to the
very group whose actions they
question.

inaugurate action, while simuliane

judgments concerning such action.

Carol Gillick '63

To the editor:

An editorial in suppression of
April 10 stated that a MYSKANIA
member (referring to me) named
three administrators as “devising
and supervising” the original plan
of action by MYSKANIA. This
statement is completely false! In
my conference with the editors of
suppression on Saturday, 1 stated
that MYSKANIA had held a sum-
mit conference with five members
of the administration and named
them. At no point in the conversa-
tion was it even inferred that the
administration bade made any at-
tempt to influence any decision by
MYSKANIA.

On Sunday afternoon. MYSK-
ANIA met with the editors of
suppression and made it clear that
administration had not instigated
the plan.

Naturally. the number is limited.
The big question is how are these
representatives of college life to be
