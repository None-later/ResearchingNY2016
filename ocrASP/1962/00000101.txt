the suppression editorial, Dr. Col-
lins replied that he did not know
but that it was possible.

Friday morning the 'l‘imesUnion
printed an article stating that Mys-
kania had an appointment with the
mayor and would probably discuss
the editorial.

Myskania had prepared a state-
ment which attempted to clarify
the situation:

“It is the opinion of MYSKANIA,
the elected honorary judicial body
of State College, that the true senti-
ments of our student body regard-
ing relations between the College
and the Albany Police Department
should be made public.

"We feel that there has been in-
creasing cooperation between the
Albany Police Department and
State College.

“The publication ‘Sttppt‘ession' is
not a rei'otltii/etl student organiza-
tion of our (‘ollege The editorial,
which recently received widespread
publicity iii the Albany newspapers,
we. believe was not representative
of lite feelings of our student body:
it was merely the opinion of the
editors. We reali/e that problettts
exist, bttt recognized organizations
and the adtninistratiott have been
cooperating with the Albany I’olv
ice Department iii a manner repre-
sentative of our college."

They gave copies of this state-
ment to Police t‘hicf ’I‘uffey and to
Mayor Corning; when they return-
ed, they gave a copy to President

bulletin board, and filed another.
News Reports

After Myskania’s explanation to
the police, the Knickerbocker News
called Dr. Carrino's office and ask-
ed for comments on Myskania’s ac-
tion. Dr. Carrino explained that he
had no statement for publication
but that suppression would not be
suppressed.

When the Knickerbocker News
asked for comments from the edi-
tors of suppression, Neiderman
said. "An editorial is an opinion
of the editors. We don‘t claim to
represent the student body." Friday
evening the Knickerbocker News
published a picture of Myskania
going into the Mayor’s office and,
under a headline of “Corning, 'I‘uf-
fey (ict Student‘s Apology," stated
that a "student delegation front
State (‘ollege apologized . . . for an
editorial . . . which criticized police
handling of parking violations
around the campus,"

The article quoted .\lyskania
chairman ltichard Kelly as saying
that the editorial didn‘t express
the "true sentiment ot our student
body." It attributed such state-
metits to "I had then: iii ltt't’c and I
gave them the otte two , . I told
tlietii they didn't ltave atiy imagin-
ation They don't think They don‘t
plan tandi i think they're
swing to change their time now" to
Dr. ('arrino. Although Dr. t‘art'ino
claims that he made no statements
for publication, no retractions were
were announced to the paper.

The situation was also referred
to in an editorial in the Times-

(‘olling posted one on the Myskania Union Sunday.

Group Conferences

Also on Sunday Myskania and
suppression held a joint meeting to
discuss the issues and policies in
general in an attempt to "erase the
picture of two opposing groups.”
Myskania explained that they did
not necessarily disagree with the
editorial but with the inaccurate
publicity it evoked and that they
had not “apologized” to the city
officials.

Myskania also told the suppres-
siott editors that the decision to ex-
plain to the officials was not based
on the order or advice of the ad-
tninistratioii. The suppression edi-
tors, howevet: interpreting further
remarks of one Myskania member
to mean that the administration
had "devised aiid supervised the
plan,“ published a suppression sup
plemcttt Tuesday which stated this
interpretation attd stressed that ev-
eryone ltad distorted truth. It cott-
eluded. ".\‘eedless to say, now that
t‘orning and 'l‘uft'ey know there's
division at. State College there will
be no qttick solution to the parking
problem. With good reason. we ex
pect the contrary.”

.\lyskania members in a confer»
cure with suppression and the State
(‘ollege News ’I‘nesday evening
stated again that the administra»
tiott had tio previous knowledge of
their course of action t‘Xci'pt that
.\ly‘skanta had made some decision

The same evening suppression
editors coiitmentcd, "Myskania
said there was no direct influence
«this is correct. We feel that in-
direct pressure was exerted first

oit Steve Condojani who placed the
package in Myskania’s lap, and
they reacted to that indirect pres-
sure whcn they visited Coming
and ’I‘uffey. The question of direc-
tion or indirection is really a ques-
tion of administrative subtlety and
subsequent susceptibility to sug-
gestion."

State Attends
Union College
Conference

By PAT CERRA

Local colleges started a series of
conferences with a conference at
Union College on February 18, for
the purpose of discussing problems
co m m o n to Skidmore, R.P.I.,
L'nion, Russell Sage, Albany State,
and Hudson Valley Community Col-
lege.

State was rcprcsettted by Bill
Leo '64, Steve Condojani ‘63, Lenny
Lapinski '64. and Pat Cerra ’64.

The first major discussion een~
tcred on publications. With regard
to handbooks. the idea catnc ottt
that many colleges require partici-
pants in such activities to pass a
test and maintain a 2.2 average as
prerequisites.

()ther colleges have avoided otlr
problem of having insufficient stir
dent support for literary magazines
by liming tinglish faculty members
ask their classes to contribute to
creatiie writing magazines.

The question of salaried editors
was discussed. It was pointed ottt
that none of the schools represent-
ed currently give their newspaper
editor a salary.

suppression

Uiit' weekly. suppression, was
brought tip by our representatives.
The representatives of the other
colleges felt that there is no rea-
son to s it p p re ss suppression.
They also felt that such journals
should be given a period of time in
which to mature before they are
subjected to final judgments.

After the discussion of publica-
lttillS, catne the one big surprise of
the conference. The Skidtnore girls
announced that they could sign out
for weekends on their honor. In
reference to our present problems
on this score, this was quite a
shock. The honor system is also
used for testing at Skidmore. Along
with the idea of tests and finals.
It I’ t. has a machine where any
student catt get old finals of their
professors. This idea was initiated
to equalize the advantage of Greeks
and non tit'eeks‘ iti view of the file
systcitt

I'atulty Relations
