New York City Mayor Robert F.
Wagner. it Democrat. and New
York State Governor. Nelson A.
Rockefeller. a Republican. have
been arguing over the effects of the
new state aid plan for city schools.

The old system. begun in 192.5
and known .i~ the 'llcferrcd l'ay»
mcnt” plan. refers to the schedule
of lttty'lttt’lll‘» ot state aid to New
York til)

the payments tor a September
to .liiiic school year have been
made in three parts: the first quar-
ter payment is given on January
15: quarters two and three are giv-
en on April 15; the last quarter
payment is made on September 15.
This final payment comes three
months after the end of the school
year for which the payment is
made.

Forced Borrowing

This situation of receiving money
after it is needed has led New York
(‘ity to borrow on the money they
will be receiving. The state pay-
ments are used to retire the loans.

The new system is known as the
“(‘urrent-l’aymcnt" plan. Under
this plan quarter payments are
made in September and January
of the school year and half of the
total state aid is given in April.

'l‘hiis schools thus begin receiving
money when the school year begins
and receive the final payment in
April of the school year instead of
three months after the school year
ends.

The new system is scheduled to
start with the 19623 school year.
l'ndcr the old system a payment of
sistittoyittu is due to New York (‘ity
on September 15. The city is sched-

uled to begin borrowing on this

payment iii order to meet current
operation costs

l‘nder the new system a payment
oi oi million is dtie on the same
date of September 15. The old pay-
ment is for expenses incurred dur-
lllL school year t9til-lti62, and the
llt'\\ payment is for school year
ltltiL‘ litt'iil

The awarding of nearly half the
total tiscars to this film points up
a disappointing tendency of the
Academy Without denying the es-
ccptioiiiil quality of West Side
Story. it seems unlikely that one
film could be better iii nearly evv
cry aspect than all the rest of the
hundreds released during the year.

This trend is nothing new, having
shown itself I“ the monopolies of
Ben Ilur and (iigi at previous
award ceremonies. It even harks
back to the olden days of (tone With
The Wind. It's possible that this
tendency is an unconscious one,
with the voters slightly favoring a
certain picture over the other nom-
inees since “it’s an important pic»
tut‘e, and might as well get all it
can." (‘ertainty Ben Ilur deserved
very few of the many awards that
it won.

tillllt‘

deferred payment plan.
Robbery

This announcement has caused
anquislied cries that New York City
has been “robbed.” Further injury
was added when Mr. Ilurd ruled
that the city may not borrow on
the September payment. due under
the current payment plan.

This ruling clearly leaves New
York City without any state money
to finance its 900 schools for the
rest of the school year.

Rockefeller has attempted to an-
swer the complaints by stating
that “actual” payment during the
school year 1962-1963 will be great-
er than those made during school
year 1961-1962.

Poor Answer

llis answer is ridiculous because.
as I have already stated, under the
old system of payments the school
year has little relation to the sched-
ule of payments. Rockefeller is
trying to excuse the action of the
State Legislature by comparing the
last quarter payment of 1960-1 plus
the first threequarters of 1961-2 aid
with the aid due under the new sys-
tem for school year 1962-3.

Increase vs. Decrease

Rockefeller claims that State aid
has been increased 48 million dol-
lars. The figures of Mayor Wag-
ner; Max .1. Rubin. the president
of the New York City School Board;
and a non - partisan committee
which includes the 1953 Republican
candidate for N Y.('. mayor all dis-
agree with Rockefeller's claim.

Rockefeller has stated that May-
or Wagner has attempted to create
a financial crisis. There is no proof
whatsoever to back up this charge.

This political situation has gained
additional significance since it:
helped cause the New York City
teachers‘ strike.

the sometimes carefully hidden
facts speak for themselves. There
is currently no state aid for the last
quarter of this school year. In the-
ory state aid has been increased
by tit millions. but due to Mr.
lluril's interpretation of law which
etiiiimated a -ttl.ti million dollar
tu'tjilllt‘ltl. it seems that state aid
has been decreased by $600,000.

Ten For One
.IICNSICN

Another regrettable aspect of the
.\carlcm_\ Awards concerns the for-
t‘lL‘ll t'tltii category. This year, all
but one of the nominees were un-
familiar to American audiences, as
they ha\c not yet gone into release
here. The one ('M't‘plloll was Ing—
mar ltergiiian's 'l‘hrough a Glass
