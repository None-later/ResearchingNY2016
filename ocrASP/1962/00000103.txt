New Campus
Site, Scenery

By CHARLIE BAKER

()n Wednesday and Friday after-
noons of last week, two members
of the State College News staff
had the opportunity to tour the al-
most untouched site for the new
college.

Wednesday afternoon we were
accompanied by Colonel Walter
’l‘isdale, assistant to the President
of the College. who gracioust took
the time to point out the pos-
sible locations of the various dorm-
ccntral ad»
academic areas.

itory complexes. the
ministrativc and
and other points of interest on the
campus

tin Friday afternoon Steve la-
vine, the News photographer, went
with the News representatives to
capture on film some of the scenic
beauty which will confront Albany
students when they assume resi-
dence on the new campus.

Some of this scenic beauty must
of course give way to construction,
but the planners have attempted
to retain as much of the natural
setting as possible.

It is easy to understand why the
members of the Albany Country
Club were reluctant to relinquish
beautiful grounds on the outskirts
of Albany.

The approach to the Country Club
from Western Avenue is along a
half mile of narrow concrete road-
way. ”l‘he facilities near the Coun-
try (,‘liibhouse are a lake, a series
of clay tennis courts fallen into
disuse, and a near-olympic size
swimming pool.

From the clubhouse there are
\t‘l‘lt‘S of Wood roads meandering
along the fringes of the golf links.
the golf links are the main area of
construction. 'l‘lie varied terrain
of the eoll' ('lllli'r-P ranges from
homily wooded hillocks to smooth
ty lush, green fairways.

Senate, Administration, Architect
Work on Revision of Campus Plans

The Lititl'lilliSll‘Zlilttll is coordinat
in: \iith the architects to formu»
late a set of plans for the new 'tini»
pits

The plans which were shown
in the model that was in front of
Minerva are being revised.

The Student Senate, the arehi»
tect and the college administration
are currently working on plans
which will be acceptable to the
faculty. the students and the State
Legislature and thc l'nivcrsity.

in this light. it is hoped that the
architect plans for a centralized
area of buildings will be realized.
The architect hopes to see a con-
centrated area of classrooms, of-
fices. library and auditorium. ’l‘he
dormitories may be built at the
four corners of this central area.
if the current plans are feasible.

One of the main factors in the
structure of the dormitories is the
type of soil at the new campus and
the depth at which bed rock is en-
countered Soiindings are now be-
ing taken.

hoped construction will begin in the
fall of 1983.

Reorganization (‘ommittce

The Government Reorganization
t'ommittee of the Student Senate
has been helping the planning of
our in w campus.

Members of the committee have
met with Dean ’I‘horne to discuss
the various problems which con-
cern the students of State College.

In order to facilitate action on
the desires of the student body, a
suggestion box will be placed in the.
peristyles after Easter vacation.

The administration w e 1 co m e s
suggestions oti such things as light-
ing, ironing space. bathing facili-
ties, study lounges, dining areas,
recreation facilities, anti whatever

  

else students wish to have any
specific way.

The suggestions that are based
on conditions as they are currently
in the dormitories will be given
preferred treatment over those
which are based on pure imagina-

tion.

An alternate method of making
suggestions will be available. Stu-
dents may give their suggestions
to senators l’at Ccrra ’64, Candy
Dal ’an ‘63, Marlee Sorensen ’64,
Mary Margaret Welker '65, George
Loniaga ’65 and Art Johnston ’65 or
llarold Hansen ‘63.

In addition to class and office
buildings there will be facilities for
a theatre and a special Student-
li‘aculty Center. This center may
include rooms for meetings, tele-
vision, games, reading, dining, and
listening to tapes and records:
areas for a 'afeteria, coffee shop,
bowling alleys. a co-operate store,
and a post office; and lounges and
quiet and social rooms,

Drilling Precedes
A// Construction

The drilling operations you see
pictured are ~lust a small part of
the preliminary Work that must be
done before actual construction can

begin.

The drillin,v is done so that some

idea can be attained of the actual

structure and composition of the

\arioiis soil strata or layers.
