STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY. APRIL

Audit and Credit

The system of auditing courses is ap-
parently undergoing study in many col-
leges. Recently Dickinson College in Car-
lisle, Pa., radically altered their regulations
for auditing courses. We would like to sug-
gest that State College adopt a similar pro—
gram.

Under such a system any student in
good academic standing who is registered
for 15 or more hours during a semester
might register to audit up to six additional
hours, with the approval of his advisor and
the instructor concerned.

An auditing student could be permitted
after the end of five class weeks and prior
to the beginning of the sixth class week be
fore examinations to convert his audit reg-
istration to regular registration credits, by
written approval of both his instructor and
advisor.

Individual instructors could establish
work criteria necessary for changing from
audit to regular registration.

This program would enable the gifted
and interested student to graduate with a
broader background and several additional
credit hours. The less able student who
wishes to broaden his liberal art horizon
and is not certain of his academic ability in
a course which interests him could audit
it and, if he finds himself capable of the
added work load, add the course for credit.

Honor and Secrecy

We understand the need for private
student records kept by the college. But is
there a need for the mystery which sur-
rounds them? What kind of information is
recorded? Although we do not think that
students have a right to see these records,
we do believe that they should know the
type of facts that are in illl'll..

At Oberlin College, Ohio a recommend—
ation has recently been passed by the stu-
dent—faculty conference commit ec. it was
recommended that medical, religious, and
political records of students be regarded as
privileged information and that this infor-
mation be disclosed to ciriplovers, security
agents, and the general public only with
the consent of the student ('(iilf‘l‘l'lll-fl.

To insure freedom of activity, the com—
mittee recommended that student records
in these areas should not be "solicited or
maintained" as long as collcg'e regulations
are not violated.

If statements on records are to be used
for or against the student in his academic
and professional life. studi-nts should know
what kind of information is kcpt by the
school. Secrecy abuses illl’ integrity of both
college and student.

Communications

 

To the Editor:

in the past few months, lhcre have been pcriodic
attacks on inter-Sorority (’ouncil and its leadership.
My purpose in writing this letter is iiol to exonerate
nor to criticize the (‘oiiiii-il. but rather to offer a
suggestion.

The office of president of any organiralion re-
cuires a great deal of lime and effort as well as
help from fellow officers.

The fact that the l.S.(', President is also presi«
dent of her own sororin is particularly significant.
According to the lS.('. t'.!l.\'lllllllliil it is from the
eight sorority presidents lliiil :~lll‘ is to be selected.

Perhaps this limited held of selection isn't so
very wise in view of the l‘i'~p i'l‘~lllll.'li‘.\' involved in
both offices. With this in mind, doesn‘t it seem
more reasonable that the President of l.S.(‘ be se-
lccicd specifically to i‘ip"c~c:=' them on l‘iiuncil”
'l‘hcir responsibilities within lhcu' sororin arc sight
ficantly less than those of president. This fact alone
seems to indicate ilial ilii-y would be bellir ablc i:l
devote the time and cnergy necessary for the lead-
ership of Inter—Sorority l'ouncil.

This is merely a suggcslion and has not been
discussed in l.;~;.l‘ I am interested in riciciions to
the proposal.

The twelfth Annual New York

ended its busy session yesterday
after passing several controversial
issues.

Senate Finance Committee, after
careful consideration of all avail-

Church and Home

Recently Mrs. Simches and her
husband bought a former Rens-
selaerville Baptist church built in
1836 which they plan to renovate
into a home. Why did they choose
ltensselacrville'.’ M rs. Simches,
whose mother was a New Eng-
limder, answers in a write-up for
the pictorial display of hcr home
outside of Draper 349: “This stray-
ed bil of New England, hunched

on a hillside. contained a good
quality of well—preserved early
American houses —— these houses

are for me direct. unself—conscious
architectural expressions."

They chose the church because
“it was relatively inexpensive and
lcnl itself to our needs with a mini-
mum of reconstruction." The Sini-
ches plan to have the choir loft
removed. leaving a shell which can
easily be divided. The plan pro-
Hdcs for a simple living area.

\[HH'U Mrs. Sliiichcs' profession
will have its advantages too; being
a ceramisl, her house Will not oiily
“glow” wilh all shapes, colors. and
nt'll's of ceramics. biil she can
make her own bricks and tiles for
the bathroom and other appropriate
places as well.

Abstract I'prressionism

Although Mrs. Simches' main iii—
tcrest is ceramics. l asked her
opinion on abstract art in general.
She answered that she enjoyed it:
today's i'epi‘esenlalional art is as
a whole not good. She would pre-
fer a good abstract painting to
loday‘s mediocre representational
painling. She admitted, however,
llli‘ll part of lhc criticism of ab.
slriict art is justified, for there is
some that does iiol have “integ-
riiy." When asked if she thought
modern art would last. Mrs. Sim»
clics said she didn‘t know, but there
diil seem to be a movement to
"undcrminc" it.

The Essence of Pottery

liul Mrs. Simclies‘ main interest
in the field of art remains cera-
mics. Perhaps her feeling is as
expressed by Marguerite Wilden-
hain. who is of Mrs. Simchcs
"school": “The essence of a pot
l\ from an intangible something in
the spirit of the putter which he
is ablc to fuse iiilo tlic shape of his
work. which he blends iiilii all his
knowledge of the lhrowing, lhc
:‘Ia/mg. and the firing, so lhiil
i\ci',\ pici'c
much his own as his signature and
lil\ licai'lbczil. Only then will thc
poi be good lhal is, alive. And
the morc highly developed a pot-
ici is as a human bcing,
liis liiilsi for llicre is no real beauty
without l'lltll'ilt‘lt'l' "
