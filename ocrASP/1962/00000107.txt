I entered the Little Theatre Mon-
day evening. April 16, with the
clinical detachment of a critic. 1
was determined not to enjoy the
plays, bttt rather to dispassionately
rep irt the action presented upon
the stage. I carried an omnious
little notebook and held my anxiom
licn poised to recorrl the first flaw,
to list the inadequacies. This was
scienitz'ic reviewing!

i knew there were many who

the days to shreds, dripping sar-

Love Ru/es
Two Fi/ms

Love, and its many manifesta-
tions, is an ever popular subject.
Often found in films, it appears
prominently in two successive
films at the Delaware Theater.

The first is the Gallic import.
Love and the Frencliwoinan. In a
series of delightful vigiwttes. the
film chronologically \.ew.s the
French female in her encounters
with various phases of love and
sex. (,‘hildhood, virginity. littll‘l‘l»

covered. They are treated. how
