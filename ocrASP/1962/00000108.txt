STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, APRIL

Students Tour
Quito, Ecuador

Quito, Ecuador, March 28, USIS

Residents of Quito, capitol city
of this country, are regarding with
both interest and amazement an
extraordinary vehicle which looks
like a boat on wheels—and that is
what it is—wh‘ich is currently
“sailing” up and down the city’s
ancient streets and over the cobble-
stone highways of the Andes
Mountains.

This astonishing craft. on and
in which the young men livc, has
been en route to various Latin
American countries for seven and
a half months. In another four
months “The Valiant Duck" will
have completed its tour of South
America. and the boys will return
to their studies in various colleges
and universities of the United
States.

The young men are here on their
own initiative. 'l‘heir trip, accord-
ing to the “captain” of the auto-
boat, is personally — hopefully —
mutually —— educational to all con-
ccrned. Robert Hinds. the team
captain. dreamed up the idea two
years ago when he was visiting
Baranquilla.

(Members of the group include:
(folin Reid, 24, of Christchurch,
New Zealand; Fraser Shaw, 19, of
Bethpagc, N. Y.; Thomas and Dan
'l‘womey (Dan is a student at Al-
bany State), 2:3, of Worestcr, N. Y.;
and George Ilurrill, 19, of Ticon-
deroga, N. Y.)

Meeting Offers
Peace Corps
Information

The joint meeting of Kappa Delta
Epsilon and Kappa Phi Kappa
Tuesday evening offered a panel of
delegates who attended the Eastern
States Association of Professional
Schools for Teachers. Under the
spokesmanship of Don Lawrence,
eight panelists reported on the gen-
eral theme of the conference “'I‘o-
day's 'l'cachcr Tomorrow." Each
delegate felt that the conference
pointed out the excellence of State
(‘ollcgc's teaching program.

Also featured was information by
both Sheril l\’ict‘orinack and Dr.
Elbow on the Peace Corps. Already
accepted into the Peace (‘orps
training program, Sheril discussed
the lengthy examination necessary
for application, clarifying that ac-
ceptance into this program is not
final acceptance into the Peace
Corps. She explained that one may
cither take an exam in a field of
specialization, c.g. business, math,
or English, or a general exam.
After training this summer in the
United States, Sheril hopes to be
sent to Ethiopia.

Dr. Elbow, very interested in the
work of the Peace Corps, urged
that we must be aware of the world
that lics at the backdoor of Statc
College. lie mentioned not only the
presence of many foreign students
but. also the availability of Albany’s
International (lcnter on Willet
Street.

Anyone may obtain application
blanks for the Peace Corps from
Dr. Elbow.
