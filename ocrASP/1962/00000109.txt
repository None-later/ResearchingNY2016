Should Fiscal Tricks

Mean Tax Increase?

There are good reasons to believe that
there will be a tax rate increase next year.
The state is currently living well beyond
the means produced by current tax rates.
Although this year’s state budget is bal-
anced, it is balanced only with the help of
three windfalls
Spending in this year's budget rose by
226 million while taxes rose by only 86 mil-
lion. The difference ol' 140 million is being
made up by:
l——collecting thirteen months of cigar-
ette tax in this fiscal year.

2—colleeting the ordinary corporation
tax and at the same time putting
corporations on a pay-as-you—go sys-
tem, and

3—colleeting a 41 million loan from the

Thruway Authority.
These are termed windfalls because:
l—next year there will be only eleven
months cigarette tax.
2—this year twice the normal tax is be—
ing collected, when there will never
again be a similar situation. and
3—the Thruway Authority has now paid
all it owes and had to borrow 17 mil-
lion in order to repay the state.

With 140 million dollars in “one shot"
revenues, the state budget will produce the
relatively minute surplus of 5 million. Next
year's budget will have to make up for the
“loss” of 140 million as well as find the
money for increased spending which was
planned in laws passed in the last session.
One of the laws which plans increased
.lspending is the new state aid to education
aw.

We of the State College News are not
against the spending of state money. We
do feel, however, that the people of the state
are entitled to an accurate picture of the
state’s finances.

If more money is needed for such worthv
causes as education. it should be spent: but,
at the same time, it should be appropriated.

We see no reason for going off “pay-as—
you-go" for the year of a gubernatorial elec-
iltill The “pay-as-you-go“ system is the
only worthwhile achievement of the past
eight years in the opinion of many New
York residents. tPay-as—you-go” means no
deficit spending.)

If it were not for the windfalls. the
State would have a 135 million dollar deficit
tor the current year. With the increased
spending. which is already written into our
laws. next year we ran look forward to an-
other rise in spending. This year the rise
was 226 million dollars. Next v or it will be
approximately the same size rise. The de—
lieit Without new or increased taxes will be
366 million dollars 7
y We are not for deficit, spending: we are
for planning for the future We are not in

favor of the fiscal tricks used by our L’ov—
ernor, '
