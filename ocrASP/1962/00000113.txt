Apathy Tradition Fol/s!

It has become something of a tradition at
State College for the News to publish at
least one editorial on apathy a year. This
year we have a problem: apathy seems to
be all but dead. Few students have been ex—
empt from strong feelings and interests
concerning some phase of college life

whether intellectual or social. academic or

extracurricular.

Administration. faculty. and students
have devoted many hours and thoughts to
planning facilities and revamping activities
and attitudes for the move to the new camp-
us. Fraternities and sororities have tried to
evaluate their purposes and achievements.
At least two of the Senate meetings were
marked by an abundance of non-Senators.
people who provided worthwhile contribu-
tions to such movements as the tuition
march.

The State College News received more
“Letters to the Editor" than ever before.
Dramatic productions scheduled increased
performances. Students exhibited more in—
terest in political and social trends; many
considered joining the Peace Corps. One of
the biggest reversals from apathy took the
form of a literary revival with two issues of
Primer and weekly editions of a new publi-
cation. suppression.

Exams will be here sooii and then the
summer. Will the summer he a "cooling—
olt" period or a time for new plans and en-
thusiasms? State College students l‘tth‘
succeeded in revolting against apat by. Now
will more of them succeed in replacing it by
constructive concern and action"

What trends will each of the thrci; cafe—
teria castes provoke next year" We hope
they‘ll still criticize each other: we hope
that the Greeks will still salvagt copies of
suppression. that the Cave members will
discuss Senate columns and Myskania ac
tions. and that those in the side cafeteria

will continue to be aware that they also
have much to contribute to their fellow
students.

And. optimistically. we are hoping that
next year we won‘t hear questions like "Who
is SA. president?". “What does Myskania
mean)“. “Who chooses Senate)” These
people. elected by one-third of the students.
iudge even suppression.

We hope that students will continue to
contribute to suppression. to write lcitt'a's.
to talk to Senators: maybe someone some
day will even start a petition. maybe even
for a student referendum \Vc hope the
apathy editorials will be a lost llitfiiiltill
