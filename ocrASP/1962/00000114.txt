Dr. Anne Oliver

Physics is popularly considered
a field for only the most dedicated
of men An outstanding exception
to this misconception is Dr. Anne
R. Oliver of the Physics Depart-
ment.

Not only does she teach this
subicct that is considered so an
intelligible to yvomen. but she also
has done extensive research on
the peace time potentialities of nu-
clear energy at Brot'ikhayen. a la
boratory operated by a group of
Northeastern universities Anyone
having had elementary chemistry
will have some notion of her work
with the interactions ot unstable
atomic particles.

Difficulty For Women

In Oliver admits the difficulty
that women at one time encounter-
td as physicists Part of this dil
ficiilty arose troin the tact tlt'll

Dr. Oliver and a number of oili

they have formed a group which
will provide compettiit speakers

lt'l‘t‘Slf‘fl organizations As stated
by Dr. Oliver "Through this group.
we are trying to mtike available
accurate information so that peo~
ple can make up their own minds
about political decisions"

Slanted Articles

Too often articles supposedly go'-

According to my psychology
professor. the biological needs are
the most deep-rooted needs. All

ignore either the rapid increase of
all types of cancer. lukcmia. gen-
etic defects at birth. or the short-
ening of the life span. Our great
inctropolises will be reduced to
neat piles of radioactive dust.

Morality in the Nuclear Age does
not involve conventional morality.
Under no circumstances can any-
one condone the wholesale slaugh-
ter of civilian populations. No one
in his right mind could ever hope
to iustify nuclear yvar on behalf of
national interest

lloly Myth

We Americans seem to enjoy the
myth that we are fighting some
sort of holy war. Right is not a
possession of neither the Soviet nor
the American government,

'fhose who would believe the
gospel according to Barry (iold'
water seem to forget the vested
interest of the human race over
the interest of governments.

God. contrary to popular opiuiioii.
does not wave an American flag.
t‘iti‘ view of the situation should
not be through red. yvhite. and blue

lasses but it should be a pers-
:tt‘t'ltve orieutcd on the race of
man

obligation to the world to take uni-
lateral initiative tiiot total disarm

We could begin by ceasing our
atomic tests in the Pacific Ocean

impending tragedy of atomic war.
It is absurd of us to think that these

If Wt' as a nation can eyer llt‘llt‘\t'

their hopes in the perpetuation of a
futile arms race.

Absence of War

The deterrent is a mechanism tlc

effective when each side recognizes
the fact that his opponent has no
compunction in using his weapons

and enthusiasm.

Special praise should be address-
ed to the clarinet section who were
constantly well pitched in this
work as well as throughout the
whole eyening and to the snare
drum player who managed to get
through the complicated rhythm
structurts with great facility.

Gershwin Number

The abridged band version of
"An American in Paris" by George
Gershwin was one of the highlights
of the evening. The performance
was vivid and brilliant. proving
that the Band and its soloists have
accomplished a considerable de-
gree of virtuosity.

"Burlesque" by Shostakovich, or
more technically. a band arrange-
ment of selected themes of the first
movement of the composer’s “Sym-
phony No. 9." was a joyous adven»
turc iii rhythm and humor.

The brilliant in a s t e r p i e c e
"George Washington Bridge," writ-
ten by one of the most outstanding
of contemporary American compos-
ers ended the concert

Breathtaking in its intricate
beauty aitd technical problems. the
composition cati be a challenge for
a professional group ol experi-
enced mush-ans As performed by
the School llantl it sounded as rich.
liill. broad and beautiful as lllr
Salatiiio wanted it to sound

If this were the only work on
the program. it would still be
a worthy attriction for a full
house. which most unfortunately
remained halt empty. The ovation
which followed did a perfect justice
to the l’itlllll and tti its director. as
well as to the composers whose
works were selected with great
taste to constitute a delightful and
educational program.

I hope that the ttrcliestra and
the ttand continue in their ambi-
tions and enthusiastic endeavors.
the last concert leads one to expect
that the future concerts Will be
coually gratifying
