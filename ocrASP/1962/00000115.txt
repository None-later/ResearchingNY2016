Frosh Nine Bow
To Mohawk 5-0;

3 Games Remain

State’s Frosh baseball squad stif-
fered its second defeat of the sea-
son last Saturday. as a tough Mo-
hawk Valley tcatn tallied a 5-0
shutout.

The Frosh have three more
games remaining in their cam»
paign. Tomorrow they journey to
Rockland for their final away game
of the year. Then next week they
will close out the season at home,
tackling RPI on Thursday, and Dut-
chess County on Saturday.

Mohawk Valley Wins

Displaying top-notch pitching and
a sure-gloved infield, Mohawk had
little trouble in beating the Feds.

Mohawk pitcher Pete Reynolds
went the full nine innings for the
winners, and succeeded in stopping
the Fresh cold. State picked up
only three hits all day, and only
one Ped got as far as third base.

Danny Zeh went the route for the
Fresh. but he had a lot of trouble
controlling his fast ball. He issued
a total of seven walks and hit three
batters. When everything was going
right. the Mohawk hitters couldn't
touch him. in all he was tagged for
.iust five hits, but these proved
ruinous when combined with the
walks and hit batters.

State had only one scoring threat
going all day. Al Welcome blasted
a triple to deep center with one
away in the sixth. lle would have
had a home run in any other place
in the park. He died on base, how-
ever, to end the threat.

Golf Team Racks Ist Win;

Avenges Early Utica Defeat

The varsity golf team, improving
with every match, gained revenge
for an earlier setback by defeat-
ing Uti 'a College 20-7 at the
Yahnudasis Golf Club in New Ilart-
ford, New York. Highlight of the
match, played in high winds and
tinseasonally cold weather, was
captain and No. 1 man Bill Story's
fine 78 which gained the medalist
title.

The Linksmen hampered by the
absence of Roger Casey who is stit-
dcnt teaching at the present time.

18'2-812. S i e n a 21"2-512. a n d
Onconta 17-1t before tying Siena
13‘2-13'2.

Bill Nelson has held down the 2nd
spot most of the season. Ilis top
showing to (late was a 79 against
Siena.

Ed Braun in the number three
slot has been the leading point get-
ter for the Feds this year. Ilis best
score was an 82 against Oneonta.

At number four post is Sophomore
Paul Bachorz. To (late his best cf—
fort was a 38 in the second Siena
match.

Jon .\charity of Norwich and
newlywed Dave Rood of Syracuse
have divided the 4th and 6th posts
thus far. Both have been shooting
in the high 30‘s. Rood came through
with an 86 and 3 team points in the
.\londay win over Utica.

Charlie White has been the var-
sity alternate lest any of the pres‘
ent starters should falter.

This Friday the Feds will be in
search of victory number 2 when
they host l’lattsburgh State. Mon-
day. May 13, Oswego State will host

the 3rd annual state university golf
tournament. This tournament is 36
holes of medal play with the totals
of the 4 contestants deciding the
team winner. Last year the States-
men finished 2nd by a scant 7
strokes with Bill Story taking med-
alist honors. (‘oach Dick Sauers
feels that his team will do well this
year and has an outside chance of
winning top prize if (‘ascy is able
to participate.

“Once again we find it necessary
to ask girls to sign up for a sport
only if they are able to play. It not

Ambling Around Our AMIA

Well. it looks like that certain group on our Campi has
once again walked, dribbled. passed. punted. shot. bowled.
volleycd, batted. fielded, and run away with most of the
AMIA trophies again this year. The Potter Club squads
rolled over almost everyone as they swept every mayor lil—
tramural championship except in First League Basketball
where they were edged out for the title by the hot shooting
hoopsters of the George Gordon Goober Club (By the way.
is that rumor really true that this Mr. Goober was a Nari
kamakazi pilot who shot down Edward Eldred's plane”)

AMIA victories were also chalked up by another one oi
our glorious Greek groups as the men in blue and gold stut—

ture all four AMIA offices.

How You Go Racketccrsll

Albany State's racketccrs really did a cool job of bump-
ing off the New Paltz gang, but it was all done legally and
lawfully on the tennis courts. Our men With their over--
sized fly swatters sneakily using backhandcd (and tore—
handed) methods crunched the New Paltztans o-4. Word
has it that this was the first time that this team has been
beaten in about 38 matches over a period of 4 years. In any
case some things we do know are that it was the first time
that we have beaten them in a number of years. that they
are one of the best teams in this area, and that our valiant
tennis men deserve a lot of credit for this victory.

Jeiiks’ Junk

Look out National League!! here come the Mcts! This
past week they set a fantastic new record for consecutive
victories, cleverly going undefeated in two straight games
. . . And then we might (although we probably shouldn‘t)
comment on how well our baseball team has been doing in
their away games—it seems that they haven’t, been able, to
manage any better than second place 4 out of 4 times,
