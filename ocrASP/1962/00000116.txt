You must keep constantly
informed about journalistic
techniques and trends. You
must be aware of the man"
phases of life at State College
as well as the world outside.

You in u st lead school
opinion as well as reflect it —
and you must lead it honest—
ly and responsibly.

Sometimes it will seem im—
possible to accomplish your
goals. but if you care enough
and try enough. you it tind a
way. Anything worthwhile is
possible.

The State (‘ollegc News has
come a long way since 1916.
Have respect for the history
of the News: it was once All-
American. Its future de-
pends on you. With a larger
paper and more student in~
tercst, you have a greater op-
portunity titan any of your
predecessors.

And witcn the gone; gets
