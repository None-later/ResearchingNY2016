Dr. Hartley Returns,
Relates Experiences

“1 am very, very glad to be
back,” was one of the first things
said by Dr. David Hartley who has
just returned from two years spent
in Pakistan at the University of
Panjab located in the city of La-
hore. He is resuming duties as
Dean of Men, a position he held at
the time he left.

Ford Foundation Proiect

Dean Hartley’s trip was part
of a FordFoundation project; while
on leave from State he was em-
ployed by the University of Chi—
cago. He worked with the Secre—
tary of Education on a committee
preparing a program whereby
standardized tests were organizml
and prepared.

Dr. Hartley said thathis duties
while away were similar to those
at our own University. He served
as adviser to students and also
as an administrator.

Educational Differences

While in Pakistan, l)r. Hartley
noted that differences exist be—
tween our educational community
and that of the l'niversity of l’an—
jab. 'l‘here, everything depends
upon one’s final examination re—
sults. As a result, students cram
heavily for finals.

Traditional classrooms are
geared so thatpermanentdivisions
exist in the room. Women sit on
one side draped in full dress gar-
ments, and menon the other. ’l'here

Senate:

is no dating between male and fe-
male students, nor do the sexes
mix. Students often stage periodic
strikes — usually against exams.

During their stay. the Hartley
family became deeply involved in
affairs in Pakistan. .\lrs. Hartley
was president of an American
school. The three children at—
tended American co-operative
schools.

Dr. Hartley commented upon
his imp re s s ion of Americans
abroad. He feels that there is a
high quality of Americans repre—
senting the l'nited States.

Dean Hartley feels that there
have been several changes during
his two years’ absence. Accord—
ing to him, the level ofenthusiasm
is much greater than ever before.
There is a new spirit of working
together, both among and between
students and faculty members. He
also feels there is a greater matur-
ity and sophistication in the State
student body.

Office Policy

As a final note, lierin Hartley
stated policy of his office. He
commented, “\le t'i-cl thatstudents
are mature, and we can work so
many things out cooperatively.”
He also claimsthat students should
be granted greater responsibility
for many more things than they are
now — particularly on our new
campus.

This past August Dr. Thomas
H. Hamilton announced his resig—
nation as the President of the
State University of New York. He
was appointed by the Board of

January 1, 1963.

Dr. Hamilton has served as

ident of Chatham College in Pitts-
burg, Pennsylvania, and has held

Difficult Decision

Upon announcing his resigna—
tion, Dr. Hamilton said,“'l'hiswas
a difficult decision to reach. The
University of Hawaii, inaddiiion to
being a vital and challenginginsti—
tution, has through both its geo—
graphical and cultural position as
well as the presence of the l'Tast—
“'est Center, an irresistible at~
traction in terms of my own inter-
ests. including inter—cultural i'iiat—
ters.

“i am indebted to many in New
York State for their support and
eooperation...thcir wliolc—licartcd
backing has been a source of
strength and satisfaction."

Additional Statements

time by l“l'.’illk if. .\loorc, t‘hair—
man of the lloiird of 'lriistci-s,
