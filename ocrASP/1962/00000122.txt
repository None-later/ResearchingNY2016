Counselors Hold Orientation,
Parents Attend Social Hour

Once again Albany has survived the near-catas—
trophe of frosh weekend and may now settle down to
its 118th year of scholarly endeavors. Forthree days
NYSUA was embroiled in the fun, noise, and rigor of
getting 750 energetic and inquisitive freshmen started

on their college careers. .
It was a unique weekend in that an orientation

program had been set up for the counselors themselves.
Arriving two days before the frosh, the counselors
were treated to a smorgasboard at Herbert’s Restau—
rant. It was then on to the business of preparing
themselves for the fast approaching stampede of future
beanie-toters.

Fresh Arrive
Even before the scheduled opening of registration
at 11 AM, the frosh begantodrift in, and from 11 until
4 PM it was a mass of verdant freshmen, wondering
parents, parking problems, and luggage carrying
counselors.

At three that afternoon a social
hour was held forthe freshmen and
parents on the Residence Quad—
rangle.

Cookies and punch were
served and the parents were
treated to a talk by Dr. Thorne,
Director of the SchoolofFreshmen
Studies.

At 6:30, following dinner. the
frosh and counselors all gathered
together on Dorm Field for a 45
minute songfest.

The candlelight ceremony and
opening convocation occupied the
first evening’s activities. lt‘ollow—
ing the torch of President Collins
and softly singing the “Freshmen
Torch Song" the several hundred
candle bearing freshmen walked
solemnly up the steps ofPage Hall.

Once inside they were pre—
sented as the Class of 1966 by
Director of Admissions, Dr. L.
Walter Schultz. to President C01—
lins. Following the acceptance
speech, the fresh were directed
to put on their beanies, officially
making them members of the Al—
bany student body. The fresh we re
then treated to a fun-filled tradi—
tions skit featuring some of their
clown—type counselors.

Saturday morning was devoted
to a look at “The Academic Life
at State”. liach freshman met

Administration: “Academic
Emphasis Good;” Counselors:“'l'iring,
But Great!” Freshman: “I Loved it!”

by Dave Jenks

While points of view varied
slightly among the administration,
counselors, and verdant freshmen,
all seemed to agree that the 1962
version of Fresh Week was, for the
most part, a resounding success.

[from an administrative point
of View the greater academic em—
phasis in the programming was
especially successful. Only minor
difficulties such as the confusion
in meeting the advisors Saturday
morning marred a well polished
Fresh Weekend.

A slightly fatigued yetsmiliiig
group of frosh counselors felt that
all had gone well. they had ii
great time and felt or at least
hoped that thcy had aided thi-ir
counselees in getting to know :\l--
bany State.

The frosh, in their usual i'll‘
thusiastic way, seemed to in‘ huh“
bliiig over with plaudits for thi-ir
first three days on lill‘ .\iii:iii\'
Campus.

Dr. Thoma Evaluates Weekend

l)r. 'l'horne, Director of the
School of Freshman Studios, and
the man in whose lapihc responsi—
bility for l"rosh \\l‘t‘i\'l‘llli was
thrown, felt that "iit‘Siiich‘ a fcw
minor mechanical flaws lhc Huck-
eiid went along \‘vrv smoothly.”

He pointed out that the most

 

annoying of these flaws was the
mix—up in getting the fresh to meet
with their advisers. Apparently
rooms which had bceii scheduled
for tiieSe meetings were found to be
invt’dvcd in Graduate Registration
Saturday morning.

“The greater cmphasis on the
academic aspect of college life
during the weekend was very suc—
cessful,” be commented. “it was
the first year that the freshmen
were able to meet faculty HtiVisul‘b‘
before the start of the academic
year."

Dr. 'i'horne also felt that some
way should he found to get tin-
faculty in our whole weekend.

“More of the women faculty
mcmbers should stay in thc dorms
during the Weekend andi would ilkt‘
to see. the frosh—fnt‘iilty volleyball

What's this? A new Twist???

Personnel Office pointed out the
“top flight organization” and the
fact that the fresh counselors
seemed so well prepared.

H’l‘he freshmen were i-spc-
ciaily energetic and vibrant,” he
pointed out, “and the counselors
did a great job in getting them to
mix and take part in the various
activities.”

The counselors seemed unan-
imous in their feeling of satisfac-
tion concerning the weekend, and
especially in thc new couriSclor
orientation program.

“By coming back a few days
early." one counselor commented,
“we got a chance to meet all the
old classmates. let off a little
steam. and get organized iii-tore
the fresh arrived."

Freshmen coiiiiiiviits ranged
from “...too tight a St‘iii‘titliN’ to
“it was great,.” For the most
