ALBANY, NEW YORK, FRIDAY OCTOBER 5, 1962

VOL. XLVII No. 16

Activities Day to Give Freshmen

Opportunity

“Don’t wait; Activate." “Don’t
be a tool.be socially cool." “Don’t
go from a high school wheel to a
college heel, gain activity appeal.”
“Sign tip or ship outll ”

And such are the slogans that
fill the air and call from the pos—
ter covered walls as Albany swings
into the 1962 frosh—grabbing, name
signing edition of Activities Day.

This, the second of State’s spe-
cial days will be wheeling and
dealing tomorrow from 2:30 to
4:30 p.m. in the main section of the
Alden—\laterbury Dining Room.

Two-Fold Purpose
“Activities Day has a two—fold
purpose,” commented Uri—Chair—
men l’at l’ezzulo and Dave Jenks,
“it gives the freshmen a chance
to see what activities We have here
at State, and it others various
groups a chance to meet and re—
cruit those frosh who are inter—

ested in their activity.”

True Interest Desired

'l'hcy also commented that they
hoped that the frosh would take a
good look at all the activities, but
that they would only sign up for
those that they Were truly inter—
ested in and which they could fit
into their probably already, busy
schedule.

Slogan

(‘ommciiting upon their slogan,
thc ('o-t‘hairmen stated, “\l'ithzill
llic ‘s’bape up or shipoiit’ warnings
that the irosh have lll'l'l] hearing,
we expect to find them all walking
around with their nose in a book
for the rest of the sciiicstcr, Hy
our ‘Hig'ii up or ship out‘ pitch,
we hope to point up thc fact that
there is more to a colli-gc educa—
tion than pure academics,”

This year's Beanie Ball
will be held tomorrow evening
at 8:30 in the Aldon-Waterbury
Dining Room.

Dress will be semi-formal
and I966 beanies are required
for admission.

 

 

 

and there will be a bonfire.

The, rally and bonfire is open to
all members of the student body,
but it is especially important that
the freshmen and Sophomores at-
tend, for they will be judgedon their
cheering as a part of the Rivalry
cheering points. This time, how-
ever, no class cheers will be al-
lowed—the cheerleaders will lead
college cheers, and present skits
or some form of special effects.

The cheering points, which may
be determined by this Pep Rally.
might be important in determin-
ing the winner of Rivalry for it
looks as though it will be a close
contest. As a result of the rather
messy tug—of—war (the weather co-
operated) Rivalry score is tied,
with the frosh women scoring one
point for their tug, and the Soph
men one point for theirs.

'l‘he softball games were post—
poned (here the weather wasn't so
helpful) until 10 A..'\l. October (ion
(follcgc l“icld. At 1 l’..\l. t )ctobcr 6
thc women's volleyball game will
be held on the Tennis t‘ourts. For
this event, June Druain is Mysknnia
advisor to the frosh; Margit- 'l'uck—
cr is chairman of the Sophs, and
Monica Caulfield ’64 is the Rivalry
Committee livent Chairman.

The ii a n n c r llunt, originally
scheduled for (ictobcr 6. has been
postponed until Noycmbcr ll.

Today the firstofthe fourweekly
class newspapers arc tobc issued.
the newspapers will be worth one
point per issue, or a total of four
points for tour issues. the win-
ners, to be announced on t‘umpus
Night, will be determined by the
