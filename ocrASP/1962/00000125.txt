To Owe or Not 2.0

We are continually astounded by the “Flapper
Period” attitudes that abound on this campus, partic—
ularly among certain segments of the male Greeks.
The prevailing idea that a “good time” should and
must be had regardless of the price is a prime il-
lustration of this attitude.

What is the primary reason for attending college?
To obtain an education. No argument there! The
rub comes when we try to determine how inclusive
or exclusive that term education is. Although many of
us interpret the term quite broadly, somehow the Board
of Regents and society in general seem to have fixed
upon the notion that a college education should have its
prime focus upon the academic areas. Their inter-
pretation does not exclude meeting and associating
with new people outside of the classroom. Social
experiment and experience are part of the college
environment.

But there are people who insist that the academic
area should not be the primary focus. They preach,
or at least practice, an emphasis on the social part
of education to the exclusion of all others. If a man
manages to gain entrance to a college and to stay
there one semester (by no matter how slim a margin),
he should be allowed the privilege of joining a fra—
ternity. Does joining a fraternity increase aperson’s
motivation for studying? Quite likely; yet while his
motivation may increase, what happens to his oppor—
tunity? Any active fraternity member can answer that
one.

A person who experiences difficulties with his
studies certainly cannot be foolish enough to believe
that membership in a fraternity is going to really
alleviate his difficulties in any way. With alittle
thought the prospective member should realize that if
he explains his position, the invitation willbe extended
again next semester when he has hopefully reached
stable academic ground.

No matter how great a “guy” is, when he has
probationary status, he becomes a liability to his
fraternity because he is a question mark for next
term. He is not able or should not be able to contri~
bute as much time and energy as he could if he were

not straining under an extra studv burden.
A 2.0 average is the minimum measurement of

satisfactory performance set by this college. Why
then should fraternities, student government, or any
organization be satisfied with less than this minimum?
Can anyone really believe that this standard would
diminish the quality of the organization or the indi—
vidual or that it smacks of discrimination? We haven’t
heard yet Of any court trial in which someone who
achieved less than a 2.0 complained of discrimination
when he was separated from the college. If good fra—
ternity men are those with C.P.A.’s under 2.0, then
something is wrong either with the college require~
ments or with the fraternity system.

Let the potential member show he is eager for
consideration by achieving this bare minimum. Then
the fraternity can assess his character and personal-
ity and decide if he is worthy of membership. It is
possible that a person who neglects his academic
obligations will as easily neglect his f'raternalobliga—
tions.

Let membership in a fraternity be a reward for
being a good student as well as a good fellow.

Communications

 

 

To the Editor:

I think that it is necessary to
bring to the attention ofthe student
body, a serious oversight which,
although it wasn’t designed to of—
fend, certainly distressed many
students.

The President’s Reception was
held on the evening of one of the
High Holy Days of the Jewish Cal-
endar, Rosh Hashonah, or Jewish
New Year. I have been informed
by a number of people that asimi-
lar situation has occurred in the
recent past, and that the Jewish
students were assured that some-
thing of this nature would not
happen again.

Why did this situation occur?
Was there any excuse for it? Ob-
viously there is no excuse for not
realizing that Friday. October 28,
was a “Holy Day”; it was even
included in the social calendar as
such.

I think that in the future more
care should be taken to avoid a
situation ofthis nature. The Presi-
dent’s Reception could have been
held on another date, even a week—
day. It is not an exceptionally
time-consuming a c ti v i ty, even
thouin it is important for the
purpose of acquainting the fresh-
men with the administration.

David M. Crystal

To the Editor,

The officers and members ofthe
Junior Class wish to express
thanks to the State College News and
all others who expressed sympathy
over the recent death of Class
Secretary, Jeanne Blazey.

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY OCTOBER 5, 1982

Cruel Fate Aids Siren,

Pedagogue To Hold Contest
For Requested Title Revision

A new name for the schoolyear-
book, an appropriation for vaccina—
tion, and a report on the summer
Dippikill Camp project comprised
the main business of this past
Wednesday’s Senate meeting.

Shirley Blanchard, Senate Min-
ister of Publications, presented the
suggestion that a new name be
selected to replace the yearbooks
present title, the Podagoguo.

She pointed out that, “since the
school is no longer justa teacher’s
college and since we are growing
so rapidly a new name might be
more appropriate.”

Name Contest

She added that a committee had
been set up to run a school—wide
contest to obtain a new name. All
entries for this contest must be
submitted on 3x5 cards at the Stu—
dent Personnel (iffice by ()cto—
ber 15.

A ten dollar gift certificate do—
nated by the State College (.‘o—op
will be the prize awarded to the
student entering the best name for
the yearbook. Ifnone of the entries
are acceptable the committee will
select a name themselves.

Seven Judges

There will be seven judges rep—
resenting the administration, the
faculty, and the student govern—
ment. It was stated that, “a
dignified name is being looked for
and the decision of the judges will
be final.”

Vaccinations
A motion for $1800 to cover the
expenses of the flu vaccination
was passed. The resolution which

Academic Dean, Jack M. Deer—

Finance Committee was presented
by Senator Sue Murphy.

It was commented that, “the cost
would be only 50¢ per person even
if the money we re not appropriated,
and also many people have all
ready paid for their shots this
summer.”

Those in favor pointed out that,
“it would be a worthwhile service
to the students and it wouldassure
the vaccination of more of the
school population.”

Parental Permission Needed
It was also pointed out that all
students who plan to have these
free flu shots must obtain parental
permission before they can be vac-
cinated.

Dippikill Project

Student Association Vice—Presi—
dent. John Tyo, reported on the
summer Dippikill improvement
project for which Senate had ap—
propriated money last spring.

Johnny reported that the project
should be completed by Novem-
ber l, 1962. He also commented
on the fact that the kitchens and
bathrooms had been completed and
that a fire escape was being in—
stalled. It was suggested that
various groups plan work partiesto
help clean up the lumber and other
materials that have been left there.

Destroys Meek Melinda

by Sandy Donaldson

Help me, o Muse, to tell this
tale of a heroine, meek and loving,
who suffered two semesters witha
temptress so vile and contempti—
ble. I sing of rooms and room-
mates who have been matched as
the great Zeus with the help of
Chance drew their names out of a
great barrel and made them live
together, one with the other.

The heroine of which I sing is
the sweet and shy Melinda. whose
taste was cultured and refined: her
winters were spent studying Latin
and Greek, while in summer she
enjoyed the sweet song of Poly-
hymnia at Tanglewood.

Loving Melinda. always consci-
entious and uncomplaining, was the
victim of cruel Chance last fall
when she entered the hallowed
Halls of Minerva. For there ap—
pearing in front of her, as if in a
dream, was Mrs. Whiskaway. who
swiftly escorted unsuspecting Me-
linda to the high vaulted corridors
of Bacchuser where the most lovely
and appealing maidens make their
home.

But among these graceful crea-
tures now dwelt a creature of no
good tiding. Gloriana, the whirl—
wind of the gods, had arrived in
a rush and unpacked all over the
room, leaving gentle Melinda
buried under heaps of flowing
robes, jumpers, kilts, and culottes
out doing the spectrum in rainbow
hues.

On her arrival, the siren—like
Gloriana immediately became as
revered as the sacred Halls; for the
tallest and fairest of the eligible
males from the surrounding coun—
try-side chose her from all the

Gloriana quickly learned which
tables in the Union were most
advantageous for chance meetings
with fraternity men; she never
were a circle pin, for she didn’t
want to be known as a fanatic; and
she only walked up the library
stairs ahead of the mosthandsome
of her suitors.

Gloriana and Melinda got along
quite well according to Gloriana,
for uncomplaining Melinda could
easily be conned into makingshak-
are when Gloriana made cheer—
leading, or making costumes for
the fresh skit when Gloriana be-
came the star, or even working on
all the committees which (iloriana
ran.

Alas, but kind Melinda didn‘t
have the wiles of cunning Gloriana
"ind couldn’t play on the heart—
strings of her professors as deft
Gloriana could.

Thus, as the earth revolving
around the sun surer makes the
Weeks and months pass, so came
Final time. All of (lloriana’s
friends would flit like the hum—
mingbird down to her room to chat.
In all this confusion, loving Me-
linda would retreat to the tense,
crowded study rooms. Surely
enough during the summer.
Hermes. tine swift messenger of
the gods, was sent down from
Olympus to Melinda at'l‘anglewood
to bring her the sad news that she
wouldn’t be allowed to return to the
Halls of Minerva next fall. (in his
