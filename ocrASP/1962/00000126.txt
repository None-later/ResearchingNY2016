'Culture Shock’ Symbolizes
Journey of ’63 Ambassador

by Ross Dunn

Few Americans can travel
to Europe or to any other for—
eign country without experiencing
what Experimenters in Interna—
tional Living know as culture
shock.

It may attack suddenly as you
gaze for the first time into a
plate of well—cooked snails. Or it
may be annoyingly persistent as
you wait impatiently until 10:00 to
sit down to an hour’s worth of
dinner. Or again culture shock
may strike in a fit of laughter
while you watch faithful Tonto on
the T.V. speaking a peculiar dia—
lect of Indianized French.

Whatever the form it takes,
culture shock, or the sensations of
surprise. frustration, irritation,
etc., produced by meeting a brand
new society face to face, assaults
the foreigntravelerfrom alldirec—
tions.

Folkways Attacked

He doesn’t realize how accus—
tomed he is to his special Ameri—
can folkways and habits of living
until he finds himself with people
who know nothing about most of
them. Then, rather than accepting
a whole new set, he sometimes
reacts in a critical and tactless
manner. Strang' prejudices may
he expressed, and chauvinistic
banners are raised. “This chateau
is just too charming, but now where
can I find a good American res—
taurant.”

pared to experience, yes, but also
to reduce and deal with the phe-
nomenon of culture shock.

Purpose

The most important objective of
the Experiment, founded by Donald
Watt in 1932. is to promote na—
tional and world understanding
through a person-to—person ap—
proach. Several hundred young
A mcricans leave the headquarters
of the Experiment in l’utncy, Ver—
mont each summer loaded down
with American habits nndattitudes,
true, but also equipped with neon—
viction to return home with new
outlooks and, above all, prepared
to meet a different kind of culture
on its own terms. I‘prerimenters
leave the USA. ready to “expect
the unexpected” and to “acceptthe
unacceptable.”

The group ofele Ven young A mcr-
icans with whom I traveled lived
for three and a half Weeks in iht‘
old city of Nantes in western
Francr. Each of us stayed in thc
home of a native family, not so
much as guests, but as temporary
members. \\c all shared our
family's daily routines, bet-ann-
acquainted with their attitudes on
most subjects and in scvcralcases
made their lasting friendship.

More Travels

The second half of the summer
was spent touring Franco and tho-«-
neighboring countries. ()ui'gi-oup,
including the eleven Amcricans and
several young pooplc from our
French families, travcli-dbychar—
tered bus, sleeping in puptcnts and
eating in the opt-n.

Pressure Point is one Of the few
remaining representatives of a
nearly extinct species; it is an
American picture of quality and
importance.

Produced by Stanley Kramer. the
film concerns the clash between a
prison psychiatrist and one of his
patients during the Second World
War. The prisoner is a psycho-
pathic personality and an Ameri-
can Nazi who is violently anti-
Negro and anti-semetic. The con-
flict between the two men is height-
ened since the psychiatristishim—
self a Negro.

Like a documentary, the movie
follows this case from the pris—
oner’s arrival to his final parole,
and shows in detail the procedure
the doctor uses to determine the
causes of his behavior. Ily using
brief flash—hacks from the pa—
tient’s Childhood and his adult
life, the director shares with the
audience the fascinating probing
that takes place.

Nazi Views Explored

A film should be (and this is)
more than justacasehistory,how—
ever interesting it may be. The
personal conflict which develops
between the doctor and the patient
is in itself interesting and makes
the picture more impressive. The
reasons for the Nazi’s views are
presented, and we watch as the
young doctor waivers toward ac-
cepting them himself, but decides
against it.

The plot condensed into such a
brief paragraph seems tame and
tedious. As presented by Director
Hubert Cornfield and Production

Designer Rudolph Sternad, it is a
fascinating film that the viewer will
long remember.

The style of the picture is an
unusual one—fluid, and extremely
effective in which the flashbacks
demanded by the story fit well.
During analysis the patient des—
cribes several short incidents
from his past. These incidents
are presented as short flashbacks,
and they are constantly inter—
changed with scenes ofthe present.
In fact, the past incidents occa—
sionally even take place in the
psychiatrist’s office with doctor
and patient looking on. This merg—
ing of past with present is very
smoothly done and very efficient.

Poitier Excels

Sidney Poitier excels as the
doctor who, although superficially
calm. is torn by the problems of
his color and his work. l’oilici"s
performance is strong, forceful,
and thoroughly satisfying.

lie is challenged for acting
honors by Ilobby Darin (of all
people). ()nly occasionally docs
Darin lapse into his Cockly Kid
pose. Most of the time he gives
a sensitive and believeablc intcr~
pretation of a difficult role.

Excellent acting and direction,
as well as good writing combine to
make Pressure Point an exception-
a1 film, but it is not flawless. 'l'hc
entire story is related by an older,
wiser l’oiticr while advising a it‘l‘
low worker not to quit a Stu-mineg
hopeless case. This framing story
is co mp 1c lt‘ ly unncCi-ssa rv and
serves only as a showcase hii‘
l’etcr Falks’ talent.

Dr. Hough to Give Program

0n Prehistoric

Next \V'cdncsday at 8 p.m. in
Draper 349, the Albany Chapter of
the Sigma Xi, national research
honorary society, and the universi—
ty are jointly sponsoring Dr. Jack
Ilough, who will discuss “'l‘hc Pre—
historic (lrcat Lakes of North
America.”

'l'hese lakes came into existence
only about 15,000 years ago,in the
ponding of glacier melt—water be-
tween the retreating ice fronts and
thc divides of basins.

Maps Presented

I)r. liough will use a scricso‘
maps in presenting a condensed rc—
vicw of the many lakc stagcs with
'arlous levels, outlets, and con—
nections which rcsultr-d from the
retreats and advances of the lt't'
fronts, of unwrap of llll' land as
the ice disappeared and of down—
cutting ofoutlcts by the discharging
streams.

The history of these Iakcs has
been recently I'lfVlSt‘ll due to late
geographical and iii'chi-ologi—
('le discovvrii-s, supported by ra—
diocarbon dates; for IIiSiIiliith, llll'
lowest level of watc r in Lake Huron
in post—glacial times, in previous
studies only estimated, has now
been di-teriniin-d fairly accurately
in studies conducted by Ilr, Ilougli.
Samples he has gathered show an
incrcnsi- of IIIIU feet in the bottom
of lake Huron Silli‘t‘ the last glacial
i‘i-li‘i-nl.

Aging Process Slow

Relationships of sonn- details of
lake history to problems in ai‘r'hc»
ology, engineering. and biology will
be discussed briefly; and a view
will be taken of the. future of" the
lakes. According to Dr. liough,
the aging process which occurs in
all lttkcs has been slow in the (lreat
Lakes, but it is now being iii-~-
celcratcd by man’s increasing use
of the waters for navigation, rec~
reation, watc r supply, and sewage
disposal.

Freshmen: Think
Before You Sign

by Anne Dugan

'I‘omorrow afternoon all fresh-
men will flock to State’s annual
Activities I)ay. Why will they be
thcrc'.’ Supposedly, all new stu—
dents will be given the opportunity
to see active demonstrations of
extra-curricular activities at the
University. After viewing this
demonstration of student enter—
prise, freshmen will be urged to
become a part of any or all of the
groups represented.

Now may be a good time to re—
mind that signing on the dotted
line can be dangerous.

Joining Easy
Joining everything in sight is as
easy as writing your name. Living
up to the many obligations expected
of a contributing club member is
another story.

Time Consuming

It is safe tosaythatmostcollege
organizations are more time con—
suming than similar groups in high
school. College activities caterto
a larger number of people on a far
more extensive scale. l~‘i-wpcopli-
can be an nctﬁirvg participant in as
many as lllT'I—fft or four major col—
lcgc groups — unli-ss they have the
combined qualities of Superman
and Albert l‘linstcin. Spreading
yourself thin is not lilt' mark of II

Dining Room was around there. Of

conducting the meeting.

I apologized to them for inter—
rupting, and asked for the dining
hall. He turned a deaf ear to me,
and instead, he offered a certain
student something edible in such a
tempting manner that it appeared
as if he were offering it to me,so
I put out my hand to receive it,
and he uttered, “Not you Bud.”

The women couldn’t help gig-
