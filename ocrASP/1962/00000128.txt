ANOTHER YEAR, ANOTHER DOLLAR

With today's entry I begin my ninth year of writing columns
in your school newspaper for the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes.
Nine years, I believe you will agree. is a long time. In taut,
it took 0111' a little longer than nine years to dig the Suez
Canal, and you know what a gigantic undertaking that twist
To be sure, the work would have gone more rapidly had the
shovel been invented at that time, but. as we all know, the
shovel was not invented until ltllli by Walter II. ihovel of
Cleveland, Ohio. Before Mr, Shovel's discovery in [946, all
digging was done with sugar tongs ~ a method unquestionably
dainty but hardly what one would call rapid. There were, natu-
rally, many efforts made to speed up digging before Mr. Sliovel's
hreaktliroiigliwnotably an attempt in Itll‘.’ by the immortal
Thomas Alva Edison to dig with the phonograph, but the only
thing that happened was that he got his horn full of sand. This
so depressed Mr. Edison that he fell into a fit of melancholy
from which he did not emerge until two years later when his
friend William Wordsworth, the eminent nature poet, cheered
him up by imitating a duck for four and a half hours.

Hut Idigress. For nine years, l say, I have been writing this
column for the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, and for nine
years they have been paying me money. You are shocked. You
think that anyone who has tasted Marlboro's unparalleled
flavor, who has enjoyed Marlboro's filter, who has revelled in
Marlboro's jolly red and white pack or box should be more than
willing to writ» about Marlboro without a penny's eompeiisa~
tion. You are wrong.

Compensation is the very foundation stone of the American
Way of Life. Whether you love your work or hate it, our system
absolutely requires that you he paid for it. For example, I
have a friend named Rex (llebe, a veterinarian by profession,
who simply adores to worm dogs. l mean you can call him up
and say, “Hey, Rex, let‘s go howl a few lines," or "Iley, Rex,
let's go flatten some pennies on the railroad tracks," and he
will always reply, “.\'o, thanks. I better“ stay here in ease
somebody wants a dog wormed." I mean there is not one thing
in the whole world you can name that Rex likes better than
worming a dog. ’illt even so, Hex always sends a bill for worm—
ing your (log hi-eause in his wisdom he knows that to do other-
wise would be to read, possibly ii'reparably, the fabrie of
democracy.

Patrol to Issue
Parking Fines

The parking lot has been a
major problem for many years.
This year Campus Commission is
making a maximum effort to con—
trol this situation, but your co—
operation is needed.

450 Permits

Over 450 parking permits were
distrilnited. This number greatly
exceeds the capacity of the lot;
therefore. parking will be on a
first-Come—first—served basis for
permit holders only.

Patrol Organlled

A student parking lot patrol has
been orgaiiiZed to check the area.
If this patrol finds a violator, it
will issiie a warning. I‘IaChstudcnt
will be allowed two warnings and
on the third warning :1 fine will be
imposed. liach successive warning
will result in larger fines and
possible re \‘iii' a t ion of parking
privileges.

Warnings May Be Protested

\\arnings may be protested in
writing and left at the Iiiiorm lion
Booth in Draper Lobby addressed
to Student Parking Lot Patrol.
Protests of warnings must be made
within ten days of their issuance.
