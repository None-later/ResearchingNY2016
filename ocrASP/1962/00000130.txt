Freshmen Urged to Write
'l'he Parent’s Day Committee
urges the freshmen to write to

Senate:

Accept New Minister;
Dunn to Speak Thurs.

by Joseph Galu

The first order of business was
the proposing of a new Student—
Faculty Minister. StudentAssom—
ation President S. Stanley Condo—
jani ’63 proposed Gary Petre. His
approval was unanimous.

The question of whether or nota
minimum cumulative average of
2.0 should be required for mem—
bers of Senate was raised and dis-
cussed. No vote was taken on
the proposal.

The second question discussed
was whether or not freshmen
should be allowed to cast votes
for the President and Vice Presi-
dent of the Student Association.

Harry Thornhill ’63 mentioned
the fact that it is a tradition that
people running for Myskania do not
campaign. Mary Alice Lynaugh
’63, who suggested that the various
upper classes help educate the
freshman, said that it should not
be necessary for Myskania to de—
stroy its tradition.

Guest Speaker

Next week, due to the meetingof
the Newman Club and the Campus
Christian Council on Wednesday
night, Senate is postponing its
meeting until Thursday night. At
that time StudentAmbassadorRoss
Dunn will speak to Senate and the
student body. His subject will be
his trip to Europe this summer as
a student ambassador.

Senate, in effect, suspended its
rules in order to take final action
on a proposal that two hundred
dollars be appropriated for the
purpose of paying for the Parent’s
Day coffee hour. All three read-
ings on the proposal were held
within five minutes.

Vice President John 'l‘yo ’64
then took the floor to find Senate’s
feelings about taking an inspection
trip to Dippikill, the college camp.

Date Trouble
The first date mentioned was
Sunday, October 28. Since this
the day before bids come out and
the day of open houses of two

Thomas Play Displays
Depth and Production Skill

by (iaye Fruscione

Last Monday evening, the Dra-
matics and Art Council of State
presented the Circle in the Square
Theodore Mann and Jose Quintero
production of Dylan Thomas” play
Under Milk Wood.

Skilled Company

(in the surface, Under Mllk Wood
appears to be only an Improbable
fusion of the pure soli-mnity of an
QLE Town and the frenetic mach~
inations of It lniigh—a—miniite farce.
Such superficial exi'iminntion is de—
cciving, however; Mr. 'l'homas'
play has n depth and riehiwss winch
can be Hillil‘lti‘lillttil only when
interpreted by a group as skilled
as the one We saw last Monday.

 

Thirty Characters

Under Mill: Wood ch um i e lo s it
spring day in a small Welsh Vil-
lage. in addition to the two on-
stage narrauirs, there are better
than thirty characters winch Were
played by a gallant troupe of ten
last Monday.

As there are almost as many
scenes as there are characters, the
producers Wisely adhered to the
simplest posSibie concepts in stag—
ing. The sti:p»iike series of three
platforms, ii dais, and half adozen
stools formed the setting. The
only backdrop was the dark blue
curtains.

Lyric Dialogue

After the first Slow minutes
which sounded like nothing more
than a recitation of Dylan Thomas
poetry, the play came alive. We
saw the countryside, the houses,
and above all. the people of the
little village with startling clarity
thanks to the dialogue which soared
and plunged from lyricisml“iake-
eyed cows”) to carlhiness (“hoi—
water—bottie body”) almost in one
breath.

Players Realise Dialogue Potential

The players, canniiy iluLlll‘lillZell
as persons by being dressed ill

various shades of greys, Were able
to realize the full potential of
Mr. 'i‘hornas' dialogue. We saw
them oh an ge, chameleon—like,

from teacher to poor girl to fancy
lady and from minister to idiot to
bartender, iii a matter of seconds,

It is to the credit of the actors
that we were able to fix in our
mind their individuality only by
consulting our program at inter-
mission and carefully deciding who
played  four people and who,
these,

’i‘oni ll r eniian and Michael
l’rince played the narrawrs With
consummate skill and helped ma—
terially in preventing the whole
production from becoming diffuse.

A mere cataloging of the actors
cannot do justice to their artistry.
but it is all we can do under the
Circumstances.

tracks (with a total Senate mem—
bershlp of 18), the trip willproba-
bly take place on November 3or4.

The feelings of Senate toward
joining Siena College in co-spon-
soring a famous singer or groupof
singers were then asked for. The
reaction to names like “Peter,
Paul and Mary”. Ray Charles and
the Kingston Trio was highly favor-
able.

Committees

New procedures for passingbud—
gets were proposed. A committee
to study the problems caused by
W’ho’s Wig nominations was ap—
pointed. Also a committee to
study renaming various school in-
stitutions was appointed.

Needless to say, the people who
volunteered were the same people
who have been volunteering all
year long.

The next regular meeting will
see a fierce partisan debate over
who will fill a vacacny on the
Athletic Advisory Board. The
political infighting should make
Advise and Consent look like a

Dell comFbook.

Attention
All Poets!

by Glee Gillies

The Primer editors include this
week two of the several contribu-
tions which are being conéiderml
for publication. Miss Lorrain-
Bernacki ’65. has shown her in~
terest in Primer with the follow—
ing offerings:

The Dust of Dreams

The dult of dreams

Whirls up

To choke my throat

And sting my eyes

With unwanted memory.

The duiling, mueky

Dust of dreams

Clogs my brain.

Thought stops-

Dream filled.

Hazy, swirling, swells

Of dreams—future, past, and present
Dreams—which sting my eyes
With tears. and choke my throat
With sobs.

The dust of dreams.

Decay

What seems impregnsble

Could crumble;

l have climbed the peaks of Thought,
the height of Vision.

But my grip falls

Each time I share my view with

Others down below;

And with each step back

l Chip a little from the whole.

Thus the crags of Mind

Are softened, and the edge
Of Thought is dulled

As ineffective climbers
Futilely attempt their ascent.
