Fed Keglers Hold 3rd Place
In Capital Bowling League

Loaded with new talent, State’s
varsity bowling squad has as as-
sumed a new role, that of the
proverbial giant—killer. Hoping to
improve on last year’sdisappoint-
ing fifth-place finish, the team
swept four points from Union Col—
lege, the defending league cham-
pions, on the Columbia lanes last
Monday night. This ﬁne effort
gives State possession of third
place with a record of 5-3 (one
point for each game won and one
point for total pins). Ahead of
State in the standings are a much—
improved Siena College team and
R.P.l. with identical records of
7-1. Rounding out the league
(Capital District Inter—collegiate
League) are Hudson Valley Com~
munity College and Albany Busi-
ness College. A week ago Monday,
three members of the team went
to the lanes to attendan“organiza—
tion meeting,” only to find out that
it was also the first week of bowl-
ing. Despite this obvious handi-
cap, the men put up a great fight,
losing to R.P.I. 3-1 byaveryclose
margin. Next week the team will
meet a strong A.B.C. team with
high expectations of i mp roving
their record to 9-3.

Leading the State attack were
Paul Beaudin, Bill Branick, Dave
Roegner, and Jim Gittleman.
Beaudin’s 200—588 was high for the

team, with Branick’s247-587 right
in there. Gittleman. a standout
recruit from the freshman class.
added to the team’s momentum
with a 201, 166—367 total. After
winning the first two games by a
handy margin of 169 pins, the State
men rallied from a three mark
deficit in the eighth frame of the
third game to go four marks up (a
mark is equal to ten pins) and take
it running away. The final margin
of victory over the three games
was well over 200 pins.

With the ball rolling in the right
direction, the team looks forward
to a tremendous season that could
very well end with State in the
winner’s circle.

Potter Leads
In Intramural

Touch Football

At the end of the first week of
AMIA football action, Potter Club
leads the league with its record of
two wins and no defeats. Both
Waterbury and APA remain un-
defeated and 1/2 game behind the
pace-setters with one victory
apiece. The big game between
these two clubs on Tuesday was
called because of rain.

EEP Edges Goober:

The Potter defense got tough
just when the Club needed it the
most last Monday, stalling a late
Goober bid to win 12—7. EEP had
dominated most of this hard-fought
game in building a 12-0 lead.

In one amazing play, however,
the Goobers put themselves right
back in the game. Jim Olson re-
ceived a kick-off on his own 10
midway through the last period, and
receiving several key blocks, out-
legged the entire Potter team to
score the TD. The try for the
extra point was good, and the G00-
bers were only five points behind.
The EEP defense then settled down,
making two interceptions, as Pot—
ter notched the victory.

Potter’s two touchdowns in this
contest came on passes from quar—
terback Mike Camarata to Pat
Spicci and Dick Moore.

Golf Team
Competes in

Tournament

State sent a four man contingent
to the ECAC sectional golftourna—
ment in Syracuse last Saturday.
As a team they finished seventh
in the twelve school field, 21
strokes off the pace set by the
winning team from Syracuse Uni-
versity on the rain—soaked Drum-
lins Course.

Fred Maurer paced the State
quartet by shooting a steady 75
which allowed him to tie for third
place in individualhonors. Maurer
was thereby one of ten golfers in
the field selected to represent the
district in the ICCAC finals at
Bethpagm, Long Island on Octo—
ber 20.

John l’ossono of Siena was the
medalist with a 72, while Fran
Moynihan, also of Siena qualified
for the finals with a 76.

Other State scores were Doug
Morgan at 82. Captain liill Nelson
at 86, and Paul Iiachorz at 88 for
a team total of 331. Buffalo lini—
versity copped secondplace honors
with a 311i effort, while Siena
finished fifth Ill 326.

Spinning the 
Sports Wheel

by Bill Colgan

    
 

‘1  "l ‘ l’

“Of course I’m happy, but I didn’t expect it.”
These few modest words serve to underscore the
character of Tom Robinson, one of the finest athletes
at State today. Tom was referring to his tremendous
performance at the LeMoyne Invitational cross-
country meet last Saturday, where all he did was set
two records in winning the grueling 4.2 mile race.
Quiet-spoken and reserved this Sophomore has taken
first place in every meet he has run for State during

his college career.

In talking about Saturday’s race, Tom makes it
sound all too simple. After all, it was only four laps
long - and so what if each lap was over a mile long.
This is the way Tom describes those four laps: “At
the start I didn’t have any strategy, so I paced myself
back at about thirteenth for the first mile. During
the second lap I moved up to third, and stayed there
until the start of the final mile. I’d noticed that the
leader (Mack Green of Wesleyan, who eventually

finished second) tired on hills.

Since the final lap

began with a three—tenths of a mile hill, I decided to
kick out about fifty yards before it. I did, and he was

never able to catch me.”

There now, isn’t that simple? After all, what’s
so tough about kicking out after running a mere three

miles on a rainy, windy day?

What’s that you say?

Does this nee-Spartan have lungs down to his toe nails?
Well, not quite, but would you like to hear how he got
into his present top condition?

First of all, he started running for track last
spring; the track team soon died a quiet death, but

not Tom.

He kept right on running. As a matter of

fact, he ran all summer long in his home town,

Harrison.

For the sake of having some competition,

he entered the famous Van Cortland Park races, where
he walked off (if you’ll pardon the expression) with two
first place medals in two three-quarter mile runs. He
has now stepped up the pace at might, and daily runs
six or seven miles (on a good day 10), seven daysia

week.

Despite his achievements, Tom still remainsateam
man, who is proud of the squad’s record of four
straight dual meet victories. He hopes the team will
have the opportunity to run in the Canissius meet in a
few weeks, a meet which will pit the Peds against top
Canadian teams. If all goes well, Tom and his fellow
barriers will end their season with a little five—mile
jaunt at Poughkeepsie on Thanksgiving Day. So pass

the turkey, already.

Cross-Country Team Finishes

Varsity Boaters Bow to Oneonia; Seventh in 4 2 Mile Race

Battle Oswego Tomorrow, Home

State’s varsity soccer team will play its second home game of the season tomor—
row, taking on a strong club from Oswego at 2:00 p.m. on the College Field. The
Peds are looking forward to this game since it was the Lakers who handed them one
of their two defeats last year. The Oswego booters beat Albany at their Homecom-
ing Weekend with a crowd of about 2000 fans cheering them on to victory.

The Peds will continue their home stand next Wednesday afternoon, this time
playing host to a tough Potsdam team. Potsdam has won both its games this season,
This is supposed to be one of the best teams

beating both R.I.T. and Fredonia.
Potsdam has fielded in recent years, and it will be
eager to defeat the Peds after losing lastyear’s game
with State 4—3 in double overtime.
Team Shaping Up Well
The Peds are now entering the tough part of their
season, and will be playing two games nearly every

week. Coach Garcia feels that the team has shown
steady improvement owr the past few weeks, and
that its ability to work as a unit has improved con—
siderably. Now that the l.I“IIiI as awhole has mastered

the skills and techniques of the game, he continued,
the most important factor in winning or losing ball
games is the support given by the fans. The attend—
ance at last Saturday’s honwuopener was good, he

added, but it can, and should be, much better in the
future.
Last week’s rained—out pep rally has been re—

scheduled for tonight at 7:00 p.m. Coach Garcia will
make a speech introducing the men who will battle it
out with Oswego tomorrow. It is hoped that attend—
ance at tonight’s rally and tomorrow’s game will be

hlgh' Peds Downed by Oneonta

Wednesday afternoon the Peds lost their first game
of the season at Oneonta. The home team got off to a
fast start, scoring at 3:00 minutes of the first quarter
and again at 9:30 of the same stanza. From then on
until the middle of the fourth quarter neither team was
able to gain the upper hand. Then the winners scored
again.

Coach Garcia cleared his bench with four minutes
left. The second string Peds prevented a shutout

The freshman soccer team opened it’s season against
a powerful Hudson Valley team with 35—0 defeat. The
hosts got off to a quick 4—0 lead at the half, but then

the Peds started to jell, holding
the Hudson Valley team toone goal

Get on the BRANDWAGON  it's lots of fun!

Syracuse last Sat., broke both the meet and course
records. In shattering these records Tom galloped the
4.2 mile course in 20:29.4, smashing the course rec-
ord previously held by Tom Ryan, Le Moyne, 1959, by
40 seconds and the meet record by 86 seconds. The
team, led by Tom’s fantastic run, finished seventh in
a field of nine. Tom’s time and the team’s final posi-
tion are both considered by Coach Munsey as outstand—

State’s X-Cers ran over acourse
4.2 miles long consisting of 4 long
hills. It was at the bottom of one
last of these bills that Tom burst
into a 10 yard lead and increased
it to 40 yards at the finish. He
was followed by Bill Bronson and
Steve Doleski in 37 and 38 with
times of 23:46 and 23:55 respec-
tively. Dennis Tuttle finished 43
with 23:27 and Dick Sarnowski cap-
tured 48 with 25:40. Running
against nine schools State finished
seventh with 167 points. Roberts
Wesleyan was the victor with 37
points and Siena was holding up the
totem pole with 204.

While our Le Moyne finish wasn’t
one of our best it was good enough
to beat Siena for the second time
this week. On Wed. our Hill and
Dalers squeezed out the Indians
27—28. Again it was Tom Robin-
son who nailed first place with
17:54. Backing him up was fresh
John Clark in third place with
18:46. Bill Bronson and Steve
Doleski copped the 6 and 7 spots
turning in times of 19:56 and 20:00
respectively. Frosh Pep Pizzillo
was the last counting man across
the line for State with tenth place
in 20:30. The Peds met Siena
again last Wednesday.

Girl’s Soccer Starts Iues.

This Tuesday the girl’s inter-
mural soccer season will open.
Managed by Shari Holzer and Bobbi
