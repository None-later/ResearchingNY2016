WHAT TO WEAR TILL THE DOCTOR COMES

Now that you have enrolled and paid your fees and bought
your books and found your way around campus and learned to
hate your roommate, it is time to turn to the most important
aspect of college life. I refer, of course, to clothes.

What does Dame Fashion decree for the coming school year?
(Incidentally, Dame Fashion is not, as many people believe', a
ﬁctitious character. She was a real Englishwoman who lived in
Elizabethan times and, indeed, England is forever in her debt.
During the invasion of the Spanish Armada, Dame Fashion—
not yet a Dame but a mere, unlettered country lass named
Moll Flanders—during the invasion, I say, of the Spanish
Armada, this dauntless girl stood on the white cliffs of Dover
and turned the tide of battle by rallying the drooping morale of
the British ﬂeet with this stirring poem of her own composition:

Don't be giitless,
Men of Britain.
Swing your rulloss,
We ain't quiltin'.
Smash flit” Spanish,
Sink their boats,
Make 'eiii eunlsli,
Like a horse makes cuts.

Dear airs, you golla

Group to Plan
Year’s Slate

Mr. Edward Igoe. Director of
State Income Tax. spoke atthe first
meeting of Phi Beta Lambda.

Mr. lgoe. a nearby resident, gave
an address on “Electronic Data
Processing” of personal income
tax forms. He also extended an
invitation to the group to visit the
state income tax offices tosee how
their income tax forms were proc—
essed. Plans are being made for
the trip sometime in March or
April.

Members are asked to sign up
on a committee, nominate fresh-
men officers, and list their pref-
erence date for the field trip to
Montgomery Ward. The sign-up
sheets are on the club’s bulletin
board.

Transfers To Plan
New Organization

Last Monday afternoon a coffee
hour was held by Myskania for
transfer students. At this gather—
ing, plans for anew campusorgan—
ization were formulated.

Many transfers pointed out the.
significance oftheircommonprob-
lem. Little in the way of orienta-
tion exists for transfer students at
State.

Doublo Purpose

The students present expressed
a wish to join together for a dual
purpose. They believe itis impor—
tant to acquaint themselves with
the groups and activities of State,
and to know their school.

However, the group will not
serve a mere social purpose. The
transfer students felt that their
most important function will be the
help they can offer to incoming
transfers, in the way oforientation
and introduction to the school.

Not A Group Apart

it was clearly pointed out that
the transfer students represented
do not wish to become a group
outside the realm of State activi—
ties. Their aimistogrouptogether
so that they can become a more
active part of the campus life
already existing.

Mootlng
A meeting of the interested
transfer students willbe held Mon-
day afternoon at 3, in Draper 300
for the formation of such a group.

IOOO Parents to Visit Campus

View

Rivalry, Sing on
Parent’s Day

This year, the Parents of our
freshmen class will have a chance
to view part of Rivalry in the form
of the Rivalry Sing. This annual
event is being held in Page Hall
tomorrow at 7:30 pm.

The purpose of holding it in
Page Hall.and asentertainmentfor
Parent’s Day, is to try to convey
to the Parents ofthisyear’sfresh—
men class the spirit of friendship
and competition that exists between
the freshmen and Sophomore
classes.

Rivalry, one of State’s oldest
traditions, dates back to 1923. Each
person gets out of Rivalry ex-
actly what he puts into it.

If he will allow it to, Rivalry
gives the freshmen a Chance to
become an integral part of State,
develop an interest in and partici—

pate in college and class activities,
and develop class leaders.

The whole system of Rivalry is
based on a twenty—nine point sys-
tem. Each event is worth acertain
number of points and the class to
win the greatest number of points
will win the coveted Rivalry Cup.

Tomorrow night, three points
will be at stake for the Rivalry
Sing. Each class will present a
welcome song. class and college
fight song, and aclass alma mater.

The alma mater of both classes
must be completely original in
words and melody. The other
three songs need only be original
in word.

it is hoped that having part of
Rivalry incorporated into Parent’s
Day will convey some of the Ri—
valry Spirit and fun to them.

Freshmen rehearse for tomorrow's Rivalry Sing.
