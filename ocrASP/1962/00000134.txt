Possibilities Explored
0i Webster’s ‘Third’

by Donald de Fano

Except for the editors of ﬂip;
pression, whose careless typo-
graphy would obscure any inten-
tional or unintentional grammati-
cal accuracy, most of us need
dictionaries. We need dictionaries
to determine how words are spelled
and what they mean.

Good Old Days
The meaning of a word used to
be a prescriptive matter. A die-
tionary with anestablished reputa-
tion would quite arbitrarily (even
dogmatically) El us what a word
meant. and sometimes what it
didn’t mean. Such a dictionary.
with a royal distaste for democra—
tic process, made no apologies to
anyone. It stood its ground with
the firmness of an established
faith, unaffected by the vagaries of
its disciples, and only the move—
ment of new generations could
gradually cause its revision. A
Monarch of this old school is the
Merriam Webster New Interna-

tional, Second Editior

Photographic Language

In recent days, however, the
Merriam people have sold out to
the descriptive linguists, a breed
of pseudo—scholars who illuminate
our understanding of language and
usage about as well as a pin—hole
camera captures the grandeur of
a spring morning.

Tho Now Look

The me lies w
Mm, makes no prescription
at all. It simply cites examples of
usage, neither approving nor dis—
approving, and lets the reader draw
whatever conclusions he will. The
reader may use the word “final-
ize” with impunity; he may con-
nect the independent clauses of his
sentences with the conjunction
“like”; he may sprinkle his writ—
ings with the adjective “swell”;
he may choose from over eight
different pronunciations of the
word “lingerie”; as a matter of
fact, he may do anythingwhich such
august users of the language as
former President Eisenhower and
television celebrity Art Linkletter
have done in spoken or written use
of the language before him.

Endorsomont

Academicians, who have left the
language of the street behind them
in their disciplined attempt to
achie ve subtle communication,
may well be interested to peruse
the current vulgate, and to them I
recommend this $47.50 up word
list. As for the rest of us, I
heartily recommend continuedsuf—
fering under the tyrannical Second
Edition. I prefer definitive defini-
tions.

“Report” Features Sex;
Psychologist Probes 4 Lives

by Paul Jensen

The Chapman Report, based on
Irving Wallace’s novel, isa motion
picture that appears consciously
calculated to attract the sensa-
tion-seeking viewer. The authors
seem to have constructed the script
to include as many frank and
“sensuous” scenes as possible.

The publicity, in addition, mnn—
ages to blatantly play up the more
risque elements, almost to the
point of absurdity.

Story Involves Psychiatrist

The plot concerns a psychiatrist
who is doing research for a Kinsey—

of the American female. Conflict

Current Comment

 

 

T962 N.Y.S. Gubernatorial Election - ||
PayAs You Go Financing, Home Rule

by Joseph Galu

Home rule has been an issue in
virtually every New York election
of the past thirty years. The com—
plaint is that the state has the
power to decide issues which affect
only individual cities or cormties.
especially New York City.

I962 Session

The last session of the legisla—
ture gives one a Clear picture of
this issue. It was necessary for
the State Legislature to pass a
special law so that the CityTrans—
it Authority could float bonds for
the purchase of 724 new subway
cars.

Similarly it was necessary for
state action to preceed the city’s
purchase of the land for the liin—
coln Center of the Performing
Arts.

if an additional example is
needed, one may use a State law
that allows New York City to in—
crease its aid for the rehabilita-
tion of Carnegie Hall.

The above examples should
serve as an explanati i of why
leaders of the large Cities com—
plain about the lack of home rule.

This issue has not been raised
as much as it would have had it
not been for the transfer of rent
control to New York City.

Pay As You Go
This new system of financing
state projects is one of the big—
gest issues this year. On the
individual level pay as yougowould
mean paying for a house in Cash.
It works out better on the leve
of a state than on an individual.
In order to start the system,

logue with case. while Efrem Zim—
balist, Jr. flounders through the
role of his assistant.

This is a film that hadpotential,
but somewhere along thc line the
idea of love versus statistics got
lost.

Over Dramatization

The resultisanou;rlydramatic,
episodic. unbelievable film in the
backwash of which several good
actresses get caught. Any pos-
sibilities that the film might have
had haw: been so glazed over with
a superficial \‘cllecl‘ that they l'c-
niain completely latent.

income taxes were raised 90%
Because this produced more money
than was needed, a ten percent re—
bate was given. This pastyearthe
income tax level was maintained
without the rebate.

During the last session of the
legislature, it was necessary to
vote a 78 million dollar supple—
mental appropriation.

The budget for this year as
compared to last year includes a
rise in spending of 226 million
dollars. 'l‘ax revenues rose by
86 million, leaving 140 million to
be made up. This was accom—
plished by recalling a 41 million
dollar loan from the Thruway Au—
thority, by Collecting thirteen
months cigarette tax thisyear, and
by acceleratingthe collection dates
of state corporation franchise and
bank taxes.

'l‘heSe last two actions produced
9 and 90 million dollars, respec—
tively. With the help of these
shot in the arm appropriations, the
budget was supposed to be in bal—
ance, for the second time since
Mr. ilarriman.

Dissenting View
The state’s Comptroller, Arthur
Levitt (Democrat-Liberal), has
stated that spending was under-
estimated, while income wasovcr—

estimated. The result will Iic :.
deficit of 87 million dollars.

Next year, provisions in our
state laws will increase spending
by approximately 200 million.

It's All the Same

in the services of the state.
Rockefeller has stated l‘i‘jlt‘nli“
ly that his administration is :
sponsible for the Ci‘e.;tioii

The question of what this Itg‘ltr-

means is of great iniporiaii
Meaning
It does not mean that thi- in

450,000. because the iiiiriiiii-:

SUO To Hold Square Dance

Show, Experiences
Quambulations

by Art Fanciers

The art show at the Albany In—
stitute of History and Art, seemed
to be anexcellentdisplay of Modern
and Academic painting, sculptor,
and beauty. The artists, in addi-
tion to presenting an exhibit of
emotion. showed themselves to be
humble and winarsic.

Agnes Densler’s Glass. was an
amazing example of first—class
art, and I must confess it left me
quambulated. Although No rman
Canter’s miel §t_u(_ly appeared to
portray an undiluted version oi
contemporary grashers, it nonc-
theless barnclcd the imagination.

Above all, the etchings Were by
far superior, in that they un—
doubtedly typified ihc artist’s fch—
ings of society. There is littli.
else to believe. The respect with
which Lynn Blucknil looksiipon life
is shown by Ili'l‘ classic example
(in Mystic IIi’IV\_‘\'_:_I_II_ilﬂ lilowens) of
man’s pbrcnacity.

What impressed me most about

bonal interpretation, and as capi—
pioiis as one likes to think him—
self, he almost always falls short
of this quality.

I'ilordcntly speaking, the workof
Philip Smeltzcr was zaphorous.
llis  proved worthy of ad-
miration and l‘llj)t.‘ZIty, carrying
with it overtones of love and honor.
The realization of phramical ex-
citement in Mr. Smeltzer, runs
through his every painting. Yet,
one cannot help but stare pitifully
at his fahonkci‘.

Student Tells
Oi Native
Country

by Charles C. Obel-Omia

Editor's Note: Title is the second article
by Charles C. Obel-Omic, exchange stu-
dent from Uganda. This week Mr. Ohel-
Omis gives us some information about

his nailVe country.

Did you know that Uganda, a
former British protectorate coun-
try in East Africa. became inde—
pendent at midnight on Monday,
Oct. 9, 1962'?

Are you aware that, accordingto
the “New York Times” of Wednes-
day, Oct. 10, that the United States
offered a loan of $2,000,000 to
Uganda for economic development
using American machinery?

Furthermore. I would like toin—
form my fellow students that some—
time last June the United States,
under its program of Foreign Aid
to Underdeveloped Countries, gave
Uganda’s government a loan to
build ’l‘ororo Ciris' High School to
be administered and run in the
American system of education?

If you didn’t know this, why?
Don’t you bother to understand a
country your government is aiding
in eyery degree of humanity?

History

The first I‘Iuropcans reached
Uganda in 1802. They were Speke
and (irant, looking for the source
of the Nile, a river which starts
its long journey of nearly 4,000
miles from L. Victoria, the second
largest lake in the world.

In 1894 the Britiin government
signed to protect Uganda. They did
so until Monday night (Oct. 9) when
the l'nion .lack ceased to fly onour
soil.

I would Ilkc to thank the Foreign
Students Advisor, Dr. Frank (i.
C arrino, who arranged on my be—
half for my participation in the
Syracuse celebration of Uganda’s
independence.

Teachers Wanted

Graduates in the Teaching Pro-
gram, apply, please, to go to
Uganda to see for yourself Illi’ wild
animals you ask iiieof. iicmeiiiber
that for the last two years we have
been craving successfully for 150
American teachers to come to our
high schools.
