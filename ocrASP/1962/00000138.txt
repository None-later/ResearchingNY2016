Reviewer Finds Plays
Vastly Different Types

ridiculing modern life. Director
Haenlin wisely confines most of
the action to a park bench on
which a Gentleman (Fred Thum-
hart) and a Lady (Amelia Weiss)
sit and talk -— mostly about Prog—
ress. The Gentleman contradicts
himself at every turn and the Lady
blithely agrees with each newidea.
The director concentrates audi—
ence attention on the absurb con-
versation which the participants
take perfectly seriously.

Everyone is certain to find
something to his liking in this
ouartet of olavs.

l Notices l

We are hard-put to pin a label
on the AD. plays we saw the other
night at the Little Theatre. The
only fair thing to say is to call
them jewels. albeit semi—precious
jewels, of vastly different types.

Pauline Arasim directs Lord
Dunsany’s A Good Bargain, a fragile
tragi-eometly set in a monastery.
The story deals with a monk who
is much too saintly to suit his
fellows and who is tempted by Sa-
tan. The simplest suggestion of the
monastery wall and the trees out—
side serves as the only scenery.
The two back—biting monks areef—
fectively portrayed by Herbert
Herzop and Paul Jenson; Robert
Judd shines as the black—clad Sa-
tan. Miss .~\rasim is ll)l)(' coni-

Current Comment

Challengers Mentioned;
More Issues Discussed

by Joseph Galu

Robert M. Morgenthau is the Candidate of the Democrat and Liberal
parties. He has been active in prosecutingnarcotics peddlers, income
tax evasion cases and consumer fraud cases. He has very little
administrative experience, but this leaves us where Rockefeller was in
1958. Few people doubt his ability or dedication. the question is
whether or not he knows anything about the state’s problems.

Consorvatlvu
The nominee of the newly formed Conservative Party is David
Jaquith. a Syracuse industrialist. The platform of this is somewhat
vague although it does appear that the party would like to repeal a
few laws especially with regard to welfare. state aid and “high tax
policies.” The other candidates on the ballot are Richard Garza and
Eric Hass. Both are socialists.

Tuition

All people voting in this year's election should remember that it
was a Republican legislature and a Republican governor, Nelson A.
Rockefeller, who passed and signed a law giving tuition levying power
to the state Regents. It was a Republican Assemblyman, Charles
Henderson, who introduced a bill to repeal the law, but it was a
Republican committee which refused to work on it.

To further its record on education, the Republican dominated legis—
lature reduced the appropriation for the City College’s doctoral pro-
gram from 6.3 million to 1 million. Rockefeller signed the bill saying
that the quality of the program willbe maintained. No one has doubted
the quality of education at the state and city colleges. but the problem
has been the size of the enrollment and the scope of the program.

Full Term

The question of having a full term and full time governor is an issue
in this campaign. Since Alfred E. Smith, New York State has had only
one electol governor who has not run for President or attempted to
do so. '1" c question isthatofwhether this constant running for Presi—
dent ‘ovt' rs the quality of administration.

Rocktfeller has proposed some excellent new programs. For ex—
ample. there is pay as you go, plans for enlarging the state univer—
sity. scheduling a $1.25 state minimum wage law for 1963 and lllt‘
creation ofvarious councils and committeesto look into state problems.

Poor administration can be seen in the fact that there are only 800
hospital beds for the State’s 40,000 narcotics addicts, that the con—
struction of our new campus is already three years behind schedule,
and our tax structure. “hen Rockefeller first took office. we had .’i
tremendous increase in income taxes only to get part of it back just
before the 1960 presidential election. This year our budget is out of
balance by 87 million dollars despite 140 million in shot—in—the—arm
money.

After fotir years in office, Rockefeller says that legislative rc—
apportionment is too complicated to be considered this year because
of the up coming election. Perhaps Rockefeller should plan to become
a full time, effective governor rather than a presidential also—ran in
1964. lie may not be either.

We all make mistakes...

Booters Home Next Wed
ln Night Game,- Crush

Plottsburg to Even Record

Next Wednesday State will play its first home night
game of the season at Bleecker Stadium against a

strong New Paltz club.

The game will start at

8:00 p.m. and will offer a good opportunity to see the

Feds.

During the half-time State’s undefeated cross-

country team will face Siena for
their third dual meeting this year.
It will be the harriers only home
match this year and gives the best
chance to see top runner Tom
Robinson and company.

Foco Bridgeport Tomorrow

Early tomorrow the Peds will
leave for Bridgeport. Connecticut
to face one of their toughest rivals
of the year. Last year the strong
visitors defeated the Peds 3—1.
The booters are looking for a win
to boost the season to a 4—3 record.

Pods Down Cardinals 6-0

Last Saturday the Reds went up
to Plattsburg to face a team with
an 0—5 record. About 2,000 fans
cheered their Homecoming soccer
game. The Peds. eager to bring
their season total to 3—.3, domi-
nated the game from the opening
whistle. Throughout the first quar—
te r the Feds kept bombarding the
Cardinal goal. Finally. at 17:46
lid \t'olner broke the scoreless tie
by blasting the ball for the first
tally.

The Cardinals kicked the ball
off in the second quarter, but the
l’eds intercepted it and tICiBroom—
field went in to score with just 39
seconds gone. The r‘cst of the
quarter saw a few attempts by
l‘lattsburg to score. but none were
fruitful.

in the third period the Peds
clinched the game by scoring four
more goals. Ed Bloomfield sent
three through the net and John
Schneider one.

The last quarter saw all the Peds
in the contest when Coach Garcia
emptied his bench. Throughout the
game the Peds showed skill in
passing, shooting, and overall ball
control. The good defensive play—
ing of fullbacks (lary Smith, A]
lienrekson, and Dave Schryer left
little for goalie (iai‘y l’enficld to
do. in all, he was credited with
only 13 saves. 'l'licrever—shooting
hooters, however, kept l’ltittsbui‘g
goalie (iocdckc busy. They took
more than 40 shots at the llt'l, and
(locdeke made about 3.3 saves.

Also playing good soccer were
halfbacks Stu Nicholson, llob Sca-
iiian, forwards l"i'ed Raw, and
liorys lx‘oziclski, who were cred—
ited with one goal assist each.

licsidi- tfie New l’Iilll’. game, the

Frosli Boaters Bow
At Rockland 4-2;
Still look for Win

The freshman soccer team. still
trying to break into the win column,
invaded Rockland Community Col—
lege last Saturday, but State again
came out on the short end of the
score. losing by a 4-2 margin.

The frosh booters. for the first
time this year, went off the field
at intermission holding a lead. the
score being 2—1. However. the
Peds’ couldn’t stand the prosperity
and Rockland kicked in three sec-
ond half goals to give them the
margin of victory.

The Peds' two goals were scored
by George Guddat, and in an un-
usual way, by a Rockland defense-
man. This second goalcame about
during a mix—up in front of the
Rockland goal as the Rockland team
tried to clear the ball.

liven with this gracious assist—
mice. from lioekland the fresh
couldn’t make their lead hold up,
the offense sputtering, as it has
done in the past, put too much
pressure on the defense and Rock—
land was able to control the ball
and go on to win with their late
rally.

With time running out this sea—
son the frosh booters will return
home tomorrow and will again at—
tempt to get that firstvictory. The
opponents will be the freshman
team from North Adams Commun—
ity College.

State Harriers to Run at Canissus!
Team Still Unbeaten in Dual Meets

by Mike Kolbe

 

Keglers Move
Into Second

With a helping hand from the
R.P.l. Keglers who defeated Slena
4-0, Albany State moved into secs
ond place tie in the C.D.l.C. bowl-
ing league by dumping the Owls
from A.B.C. by an identical 4-0
margin. Chuck Hunter’sznopen—
er was the only threat the opposi-
tion could muster as the men from
State came through with a rousing
353 pin victory, 2670—2317. The
margin of victory for each of the
three games was 90, 87. and 177
pins respectively.

R.l’.l. completely overpowered
the lndians to take over sole pos-
session of the top spot with a 14—2
record. Siena didn’t have achance
as Frank Richards fired a 257 to
spark a 1018 finish for the Engi—
neers. That lowered the losers
record to 10—6, enough to make
State’s 10—6 identical record good
for a second place tie.

Pacing the State attack were Paul
Beaudin with 223—590, Jim (little—
man with 209—564, and AlSabo with
191—556. Dave Roegner proved to
be the morale-raiser for the team
as be converted the 5—10 split
twice, in addition to making the
6—7 split. The team will face a
slumping ll.\’.C.C. squad next
week. .-\ State sweep here could
mean a match with R.P.l. for first
place the following week.

EEP Takes
Football Nine
Off Campus

Last Sunday Potter Club’s touch
football squad made the first off-
campus appearance of a State
intramural team this year. The,
men of EEP traveled to Cobleskili
to play the Cobleskill Barons. a
team of local renown, andemerged
with a runaway 24-0 victory.

EEP Scorn Early

l’otter got off to a quick start
in this contest. After taking the
opening kickoff to the EEP 40,
Dick Moore passed to Dick Mann
in the end zone on the first play
from scrimmage. Play settled
down for the rest of the quarter.
and was fairly even until late in
the half. Then with a few minutes
remaining, Moore. behind the hard
blocking of Dick Stewart, hit pay-
dirt on a 1?. yard run for Potter‘s
second TD.

Continue to Romp

The Potter offense continued to
roll in the second half. In the
third stanza Mann hit Moore on a
thirty yard aerial to up Potter’s
lead to 18—0. Fl‘il’ chalked up its
fourth and final six—pointer of the
day in the fourth quarter, when one
of Mann’s passes was deflected by
a Baron defender into the waiting
hands of Pat Spicci.

Late in the fourth quarter the
liarons got their best offensive
threat of the game underway in an
attempt to avoid the shutout. 'l‘lie
losers got as far as lllf‘ t‘lub’s l3.
only to bc denied by the tough
l’otter defense.

either a strong scoring threat of a

to be missed either due to over—

Bronson, Steve Doleski, Dick Sar-
nowski, and two otherharriers who
will be chosen from Sylvanus Ny—
okaya (an exchange student from
Kenya), Guy McBride. Carl Sch-
wartz, and Mac Nickles.

According to Coach Munsey
these Peds will face the toughest
competition of their careers at the
Canissus meet. The Feds will
compete against some 20 plus
schools including: The University
of Buffalo, The University of Ot—
tawa. The State University at Buf—
falo. Roberts Wesylan. and Hart—
wick.

Canissus offers an unparalled
opportunity for the Feds, who will
be running against top teams from
the northern United States and
Canada. Several Canadian teams
are entered, thus giving the meet
an international flavor. This will
probably by the only time all year
that any State team will have such
a fine opportunity.

Blast Plattsburgh

Last Saturday State took its fifth
consecutive dual meet by tromping
Plattsburgh 21-34 on the loser’s
course. Again Tom Robinson took
first with 18:19.3. l"ollowingTom,
in second place was Plattsburgh's
Ralph Manners with 18:40. This
man gave Tom a real challenge,
and only by galloping a 4:50 first
mile did Tom attain and hold his
'21 second lead. Third place was
copped for State by JohnClark with
19:22. Right on his heels was
State’s Dennis Tuttle in fourth
place with 19:23. Bill Bronson
snapped the tape in fifth place for
State clockiiig19:40. l’lattsburgh’s
Martin Levine and Tom Jones
nailed the sixth and seventhpiaces
in l9:53 and 19:54 respectively.
State‘s l’ep l’izzillo took eighth
with 20:24. The i’lattsburgh
course, except for a half-mile
stretch of broken pavement, was
the best course the l’cds have
