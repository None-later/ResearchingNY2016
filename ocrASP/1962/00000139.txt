Freshmen Keep Ballot;
Letters To Be Sent

by Linda McCloud

Final action on whether fresh-
men should be allowed to vote for
Myskania was taken at Wednesday
night's Senate meeting. Mary
Alice Lynaugh ’63. chairman of
the Senate Auxiliary Committee.
reported Myskania itself felt
freshmen should be able to cast
votes.

Myskania feels the freshmen are
part of the school. there is an at—
tempt to know the upperclassmen.
and they do not know personalities
as do the upperclassmen. "\Vhy
step on the enthusiasm of the
freshmen when we complain of the
passiveness of the upperclassmen’.’

Besides opportunity to vote (lur-
ing the week, students can vote
Saturday and Sunday in the Student
Union.

Senator Lenny Lapinski ’64
asked if there were any provisions
for keeping the frosh vote sepa-
rate. ll was suggested that the
ballots be colored paper rather
than the conventional whitc.

Frosii Votes
The proposed amendmenl that
freshmen be allowed to votc only
for class and S. A. officers was
defeated.

Dipplkill Trip
Suc Murphy. chairman of Fi-
nance Committee presented a bill
allowing $150 for expenses for
(‘amp Dippikill. It was accepted.

The Senatc trip to Dippikill will
be tomorrow, with the purpose of
inspecting the work done on the
building.

Don Allen ’63 reported that a
50 star flag has been here for
some time; it just hasn’t been put
up as yet.

Book sales in thc Commons
was then discussed. 'l'heonlypos—
sible way to alleviate this would
be to sell only books in ttho-Op.
This would doubtless prove un—
favorable.

Tuition

Libby Stroud ’64 opened the dis-
cussion about tuition. There will
be a letter sent to parents uring
them to write to their congress-
man protesting tuition. A motion
was made that letters he sent out
as soon as possible, seconded and
passed. A suggestion was made
that provision be made for people
outside Senate to work.

Constitution Committee will look
into formulating a policy for what
kind of organization needs a con-
stitution.

Shirley B 1 a nch a rd announced
that pictures of Senate will be
taken next week at 8:30 according
to committees.

Recreation Roorganixalion Committoo

A motion was made to accept
the report of John Lilga’s '64
Recreation Reorganization Com—
mittee. it was passed and will be
tabled until next week.

President Condojani ’63 turned
the floor over to Gary Petre, Stu-
dent—Faculty Minister who spoke
of two proposed plans for the new
campus.

The plans are either the faculty
should be given separate dining
facilities or they should be given
a lounge and share the student
dining facilities. Senate willsolicit
student opinion on this issue.

Don Alien reported on the radio
station. The problem now is to
lay a cable through the dormitor—
ies and trouble with the iirubacher
electrical system

Senator Stroud rcpo i‘ic(l that
Statesmen are asking Senate to
appropriate $1500 for 30 college
blazers and trousers. 'I‘he suits
would be passed on to next year’s
Statesmen. This was turned over
to the Finance Committee.

l’rcsidenl Condojani read a let-
tor of formal resignation from lioz
Ferarra ’64.

Mary Margaret \\'elkcr made a
motion to adjourn. ltuasscconded
and paSSed.
