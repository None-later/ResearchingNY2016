STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1962

10’ Supported With Reservations

A week ago last Wednesday, the stu—
dent Senate succeeded in musteringa3/4
vote for an amendment to the StudentAs-
sociation Constitution. The amendment
is subject to student body ratification in
a referendum, which will be held in a
few weeks.

If ratified this amendmentwill require
all candidates for Myskania, SA officers,
senators and class officers to have a2.0
cummulative average.

We of the State College News believe
that this amendment deserves the support
of the student body. Although we believe
there are serious drawbacks, it does
seem better than having no standard
written into the constitution.

We do not believe the first semester
index is an accurate judgement of the
ability of an individual to participate
productively in an office, or of this
individual’s ability to improve an index.
Yet at the same time, there should be
something to protect the student from
himself.

We do not believe participation on
student Senate, for example, necessarily
lessens the chances of a person to get
off probation. We know of no senator
who has flunked out in recent years. We
do know of people who entered Senate on

probation who served actively and well
and who are no longer on probation.

We do not believe that the marking
system of our college is necessarily a

fair judgement of a person’s ability. We

all know of examples where a person
actually worked in a course and yet
failed. Either the person should nothave
been admitted or the marking system is
faulty.

It should be noted that the 2.0 is not
required to remain in the college, but in
order to graduate, according to the
catalogue, on page 46, b.

Myskania in stating its position did
not say that it would oppose the amend-
ment if it called for a 2.0 minimum. It
did state its reservations.

These reservations included that the
individual student has the right to decide
if he is capable of assuming an office.
that the students are aware of the situ-
ation and can vote accordingly and that
people with less than a 2.0 can be out-
standing leaders.

After voicing all of these doubts we
want to restate our View that this amend—
ment is deserving of student support.
The student wishing to voice his or her
approval of this change willcasta “yes”
vote.

Since it considered that “in good stand—
ing” means with a 2.0, we favor a
senate in good standing. We also favor
having office holders take student teach—
ing after their tenure, but we realize
this is not always practical.

We hope that at least 2/3 of the stu-
dent body supports this proposal and that
at least 20’? of the student body votes.

JWti

Freshman Suffrage..Who Suffers?

The question of eliminating freshman
participation in Myskania elections will
soon be a fervent one, and we feel that
a positive vote for this measure is
necessary.

The qualifications for election to My—
skania are nebulous. Someone
who “has done a lot for the school” can
easily be soneone who “has his name
around a lot” — in the right places at
the right times.

Freshmen, we feel, are in no position
to summerize a Junior candidate’s ac—
cumulative college achievements. A list
of activities in the News can be as mis—
leading as seeing a certain name or face
all over campus.

Myskania candidates take no stand on
current campus issues. they neither
campaign, promise, advertise nor dis-
cuss their merits, because lllt‘, position
is often looked upon as an honor rather
than a job to be actively sought after.
A candidate’s only drawing t'lll'tl is his

name, his record and his smile. It is
easy to see that a popularity contest "an
result, and with the election structure
as it is now, freshmen are often more
impressed with the candidate’s super-
l'icial qualifications than with his con—
crete achievements.
if it is decided that freshmen retain
the voting privilege for Myskania mem—
be rs, we believe that the following elec—
tion revisions should be considered:
1. A compulsory informative session on
elections in general, giving fresh—
men some criteria to consider in the
selection of candidates forall offices.
More information to all studentson

To the Editor:

Recently Senate went on record
as approving a minimum require-
ment of a 2.0 average for student
government.

As a Senator and as a member
of the student body, I would like to
offer my views on the subject. I
am definite ly in lavor of the
amendment, It seems to me that
a person elected to student govern-
ment who dot-s not have a 2.0 must
follow either of two courses:

1.) [It-cause of llli‘ time he must
s‘i)t'lltl on his studies. he will not
tiili‘ill his duties as

that being in student government
