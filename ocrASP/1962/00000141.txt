Parents’ Weekend on May 10.

With the Homecoming Weekend
season upon our Stately girls. many
varieties of dates can be observed.

First, there is the opportunist
date: she “goes with a creep to
look over the crop;” whenever she
is introduced to a brother without
a date. she is immediately “sim—
ply thimecl with your house. it’s
the sharpest. And all those tro—
phies.”

 

 

The gold-digger can also be obs
served coming back to the dorm
laden with posters, magazines.
mugs. and place mats. The only
reason she goes to a weekend is
for the favor, free entertainment.
and free meals.

The girl who has been to her
first fraternity weekend can be
spotted a mile away, She is so
surprised by “the things” that go
on, like 265 people twisting in a
16’ x 18’ room. or “those decora—
tions.”

Or there is her exact opposite
who volunteers every time to go
on a blind date. She has been to
about 20 weekends at six different
colleges (and institutions). She
knows all the “correct” names of
the fraternities, like FOGGY or
SAP, and which ones supply the
most class officers or athletes or
beer.

And. of course. there is the girl
who figures she “owes him s_o_ much
for the wonderful weekend" and
because he paid her bus fare “all
the way up there” and just spent
so much on tier (that’s because he
was such a cheap-skate that he
made sure she saw just how much
he paid for everything). Now she
has to send cookies to him every
two weeks and write every other
day.

Finally. there is the girl who’s
pinned to a fraternity man...well,
hct‘ weekend is another story.

British Films

Of Angry Men

That wonderfully funny British
comedyOnly Two Can Play,starring
Peter Sellers. at first glance
seems to be just a satire on sex
and extra-marital affairs. indeed.
this is most assuredly what the
picture is. and there is nothing
wrong with that.

A bit of thought, however. will

it and a group of films made by

by Sue Murphy

How readily we become buried in our little world, oblivious to all
the cryingneeds ofthe peoples around us. We grow to be presumptuous
of our nation and its guarantees. and we take for granted those
freedoms which cost so very much—And then we awake to an ()cto-
ber twenty—first, and are suddenly aware of a horizon more vast
than yesterday’s, and we turn hopefully to the sky.

We have lived so long without real fear, for though we experience
continual moments of insecurity and doubt. we have never really
known the fear which confronted our parents. But now we are made
to feel a rejuvenation of our ideals, for with this challenge to our
beloved freedoms. our love and determination are revitalized, and
we experience a new and deeper appreciation of and gratitude for our

freedom.

'l‘bough we fear for our safety and the safety of our loved

ones, it is a deeper. richer anxiety. one inspired by sclflessness.
Do you remember how you felt as a l()-y:ar—old when you saw a

soldier or sailor'.‘

'l'hey scented so tall and strong and awesome and

so very old; we were so proud to think of them as the defenders of

our country.

\tell. the soldiers are still tall. strong and awesome.

but they are now our brothers and our Irii-nds.

'l'hough we still feel pride. it is now tempered with this desperate
fear. For we know now of the tremendous wastc of war —— the loss of
so many young. unfulfilled lives, the mcfficacy of so many years of
preparing to give something to mankind — besides a dog tag.

This fear then is good, for it awakcns ll| us our dormant goals and
makes its long for the greatness which we all covertly wish to achieve
——not the greatness of material wealth and lame. but the greatness of
which all men are t'ttlltllllt‘—lllt‘ grcntncss which consists of the sum—
mation of little things—that greatness which will enable us to leave
the world a liltlc bit better than it was at our conception,

Observer

by Pat Jewell

Probably his first impression,
as he enters the upper floor, is
that of the dim light coming in
through the stained glass windows
— barely enough to illuminate the
faded murals on the wall. His
first feelings of awe may be in-
creased as he sees the tables
packed with students. elbow to
elbow. their heads bowed reli—
giously over their work. (At least.
usually it’s their work; at times one
of them may get mixed up and
realize it's his neighbor’s work
he’s reading.) The tables are
lighted by quaint little study lamps,
which can be turned off for sleep—
ing.

Reference books, magazines.
and card catalogs are duly pointed
out to the eag‘r visitor. as he
squeezes between the various ta—
bles and shelves to git a closer
look. stumbling as he does over a
lower drawer of the card catalog,
which somebody has left open.

\\'hcn he has been there a few
minutes he soon realiZes that the
first impression of quiet was a
false one. there is an under—
current of noise - a conglomera—
tion of rustling. munching. crack—
ling, whispering, scratching. iii—
tcrspersed by the “Clank” of
someone operating the microfilm
machine. floors open and shut,
students shuffle in and greet their
friends; chairs scrape.

lint our visitor has not much
time to absorb the atmosphere of
the upper library, for now he is
guided to the stairs leading to the
lower level. Rut before they
descend —— hark. 'l‘hcy must put
their cars to the ground todiscern
whether someone is around the
bend of the winding one—way stair—
case — for to meet someone on
lhc way, especially an cndomorph
—— may be fatal. and t'affic is
often heavy on this little pathway.

Rut this time. fortunately, noth—
ing is heard. andpcepingcautious—
ly downward. noone is seen; so our
visitor and his guide cautiously
make their way down to the Iowe r
level.

adjust themselves to normal light,
he sees more bookshelves. :inum—

Discussed

by Joseph Galu

This is the last of a series of
pre-election articles.

Since previous articles have
been devoted to the issues of the
gubernatorial campaign, this one
will cover the candidates involved
in other state-wide elections as
well as a few candidates for legis—
lative posts.

The second contest on the ballot
is for the (‘omptrollership. The
major candidates are Democrat—
l.iberal Arthur Levitt and Repub—
lican John Lonienzo. Lomenzo is
an affable, popularcandidate with a
“nice~guy" image, but he is with-
out qualifications gcrmanc ti lhc
office. l.evitt has held lllt ] )st
for eight scandal—free years. Its
careful administration has saved
the state as much as $300,000,000
per year. He is clearly superior.
