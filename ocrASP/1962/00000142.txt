Ped Bowlers
Defeated
By Owls, 4-0

by Bill Branick

In their second consecutive
match with A.B.C. last Monday
night, the State bowlers finished
second to a determined bimch of
Owls who were seeking revenge for
last week’s crushing 4—0 defeat.
Led by Ed \Vestermann’s 235-621.
A.B.C. reversed the score oftheir
last match with the Peds, who just
couldn't seem to get the ball roll—
ing. Jerry \\"igler fired a 221 to
insure an eight pin victory in the
first game. The second game told
much the same story as \\ester-
mann’s big game, backed byChiick
Brown’s 194, more than offsetBill
B ranick’s fine 230 to give theOwls
the game by 37 pins. In the third
game, Westermann and John Dem—
kowski combined games of 19S and
203 to inflict an 18 pin loss on the
men from State.

Leading the Statesmcn were Bill
Branick with 230—505 and l’aul
Beaudin with 172-509. Splitsagain
meant the difference, but all was
not lost as Dave ltoegner again
showed his split—making ability by
converting three of the more dif—
ficult ones. State couldn’t string
the strikes togethc r while thetiwls
came through with some great
clutch bowling. Strange as it may
Seem, :\.B.C. will be next week’s
opponent. This is explained by
the fact that the (‘.l).|..‘. league
has a place round every other
week, which gives some teams a
chance to pick up points on the
leader, lt.l’.l. at this time, [nir-
ing a place round, the first-place
team bowls the second—place team,
the third—place teani meets the
fourth—place team, and the team in
fifth place battles thecellar—dwel—
lers.

No reader, yours truly hasn’t gone over the top,
and you aren’t having Hedrick’s Hallucinations. \\c
admit that we did sort of stretch things in the title
a might, State College being exchanged for Potter
Club. But we enacted our little subterfuge to ram
home our point—for the first time in its history,
State College has a football team competingwith other
schools on a regularly scheduled basis.

Once again the men from Potter have made a
shambles of the AMIA football league, winning the
title behind a machine-like offense, and an especially
stingy defense. Last year Potter, after winning the
local title of course, marked a first here at State by
playing the winners of the R.I’.l. intramural gridloop.
Not to have their winning ways short—circuited by a
band of computers, the men of HEP rolled to a 15-0
victory. This year the Club has enlarged its off—
campus schedule to five games, making for one whale
of a season. EEP has already played one of these
games, against the Cobleskill Barons, and emerged
with a 24—0 runaway triumph.

Can You Imagine?

Now let your imagination run away for a minute.
Picture teams from other colleges marching onto the
College Playing Field, only to be devoured by the
Potter machine. Picture the flags waving, the band
playing, the cheerleaders cheering, and the booze flow—
ing. Siena today, Ohio State tomorrow!

Okay, now that we’ve built you up to a mad frenzy,
forgct it. Like it or not, there won’t be any morc
football games at State this year. Not that I’otter
hasn’t tried its best to get a few games set up here.
But like Murphy said, anything that can go wrong, will
go wrong. In this case plenty has gone wrong, and
it can all be summcdupinonc word — insurance. ch,
insurance has another meaning besides the Pavlovian
response of $27.50 on registration day. In the sim-
plest terms in regards to State football, it means no
insurance, no football.

Now, Statc students are insured up to their ears
for any disaster that might befall them during the
ycar. But, what about the men fromflnconta or Siena‘.’
\\'cll the answm‘ is obvious. lf Minerva herself
spearcd them, they still couldn’t collect a dime of
insurance. Now the administration takes the viewthat
men engaging in a touch football game might just suffer
something more serious than a stubbcd too (though we
hope nothing as fatal as a spear wound). 'l‘here’s just
no way I’ottcr can get around this ruling. There are
no other suitable fields in Albany to playon. So, I‘Il-Il’
will be forced to play all of its games away Iroin the
eyes of most Stato students. So maybe next ye:it",’

STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1962

Boaters Home Against BPI
In Night Game at Bleecker

State’s varsity soccer team will face its oldest
rival, RPI, next Wednesday in a night contest at
Bleecker Stadium. It will be the Peds’ second straight
night game, and it is hoped that a large crowd will
turn out.

In a similar night game last Wednesday, the Peds
evened their season’s record off at 4~4, by clipping
the highly-rated Hawks from New Paltz 2—1. A cold
rain turned the field into a quagmire, slowing up the
offense of both teams.

The first half was particularly rough on the Peds,
who were unable to move the ball at all, while falling
behind 1—0 on a goal by A1 Cotze. The second half
witnessed an entirely different story, however, as the
Peds dominated play from the opening kickoff.

The third quarter was only two minutes old, when
Luis Espina broke lose fromawild melee twenty yards
in front of the goal and blasted the ball into the, net to
tie the game. The Peds continued to press the tiring
visitors, just missing goals on several occasions.
Then five minutes into the final stanza, Al Henrekson
moved in from the left wing and boomed the ball into
the upper right hand corner. Thisproved to be all the.
margin State needed to ice the game.

Peds Bow to Bridgeport 3-l

Last Saturday at the University of Bridgeport, the
Peds played one of their best games of the season,
but were neverless forced to bow to their undefeated
hosts 3—1.

Most of the first half was a see-saw affair, with
neither team able to find the nets. It was not until
15:45 of the second period that Bridgeport halfback
A1 Cuylo tallied the game’s first score on a nearly
perfect co rnerkick, which he headed past State goalie,
(iary Penfield.

Rally in Second Half

The determined Peds rallied at the start of the
second half, scoring almost immediately on a goal by
Luis Oepina. The score was set up on a beautiful
assist by State co—captain Ed Broomfield, and knotted
the game up at one all. The rest of the third period,
and the start of the fourth saw many attempts by the
winners to break the tie. The tremendous goal keeping
of Penfield stopped them cold, asthe Pedstar came up
with 12 saves during this time.

The tie was finally broken by Bridgeport on a very
controversial play with just eight minutes remaining.
On a corner kick Penfield leaped high and speared thc
zooming ball. (in the way down he was pushed into
the goal, and Bridgeport was awarded a score. Pen-
fieldsaidafte r the game, “I didn’t even have a chance
to hit the ground, before I was hit.”

This goal had a demoralizing effoct on the l’eds,
and five minutes later Bridgeport left wing Joe Chec—
cio got away from his defender and blasted the last
point of the game into the upper right hand corner of

SUPPORT
THE TEAM

 

by Mike Kolbe

State’s Harriers journeyed to Canissus, New York
for the Canissus College Invitational Cross—Country
meet last Saturday. The team’spreviously undefeated
number one man dropped his first race this season.
Tom finished eleventh in a field of 170 runners with
24:23. Bruce Kidd, University of Toronto, copped the
meet by striding the 4.7 mile Delaware Park course
in 22:14.5, bettering his last year’s course record by
19.6 seconds.

Second place went to Ed \Vinrow of the State Uni-
versity at Buffalo. The third spot was nailed down by
Toronto’s Bob Buchanan. Tim Burns of Buffalo State
was fourth and Bill Mills of Toronto was fifth.

Buffalo State Wins

In tcam standings the University of Toronto was
first with ii, The State University at Buffalo was
second with 87, Roberts \\I'esylan was third with 153,
and State’s l’eds finished thirteenth out of twenty-one
schools with 368. Le Moyne was fourteenth with 377.

The scoring Harriers besides Tom were: 69 Dennis
Tuttle, 74 Bill Bronson, 106 Dick Sarnowski, 108
Steve Doleski, and State’s displacer Guy McBride 124.

“It wasn’t his day,” said Coach Munsey when asked
about the performance of State’snumberone Ped, Tom
Robinson. The course was the longest he had ever
run over and the competition was the stiffest he had
ever faCed. He got off to a bad start but worked his
way up to sixth and held that position throughout the
race. It was in the last crucial 350 yards that Tom
was challtaiged and couldn’t quite answer his challen—
gcl‘S. “lie just didn’t seem to have it,” commented
Coach Munscy.

Team Did Well

\\hilc Tom didn’t win, he and his fellow Ped
teammates came up to all oftheir Coach’s expectations.
The team was in the top fifteen and for a school that
has bad Cross—Country for only two years this is
quite an accomplishment. “It was a team effort all
the way and they came through with flying colors.”
(Quote Coach Munsey.

Next to Siena’s, perhaps the toughest dual meet
i'rin'ilitflltifm State’s .\'~Cers will have will be the New
t’aitz meet tomorrow. This team, whose two key
men are exchange students from Kenya, defeated
Siena two weeks ago 21—33.

Potter Club Wins Football Title;
Defeats APA In Last Tilt, 18-0
