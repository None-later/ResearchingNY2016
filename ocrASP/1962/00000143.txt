EAT, SLEEP, AND MATRICULATE

The trouble with early morning classes is that you're too sleepy.
At late morning classes you’re too hungry. At early afternoon
classes you’re too logy. At late afternoon classes you’re too
hungry again. The fact is—and we might as well face it—there
is no good time of day to take a class.

What shall we do then? Abandon our colleges to the ivy? I
say no! I say America did not become the hope of mankind and
the world’s largest producer of butterfats and tallow by running
away from a. fight!

If you’re always too hungry or too sleepy for class, then let's
hold classes when you're not too hungry or sleepy: namely, when
you're eating or sleeping.

Classes while eating are a simple matter. Just have a lecturer
lecture while the eaters eat. But watch out for noisy food. I
mean who can hear a lecturer lecture when everybody is crunch-
ing celery or inatzo or like that? Serve quiet Stilff~llke anchovy
paste on a doughnut, or steaming bowls of lamb fat.

And kindly observe silence while lighting your post-prandia
Marlboro Cigarette. Don’t be striking kitchen matches on your

       

\1 A 7‘, . -«4 ,

f/ﬂE/ﬁw’i
jeans. Instead carry an ember from the dormitory ﬁreplace in
your purse or pocket. Place the Marlboro against the ember.
Light it quietly. Smoke it quietly. ()h, I know I ask a great
deal! I know that one's natural instinct upon encountering
Marlboro’s fine flavor and ﬁlter is to throw back oiic’s head and
bellow great, rousing cries of joy. But you must not. You must
contain your ecstacy, lest you disturb the lecturing lecturer.
You can, if you like, permit yourself a few small shudders of
pleasure as you smoke, but tiike care not to wear garments
which will set up a clatter when you shudder—like taffeta, for
example, or knee cymbals.

Let us turn now to the problem of learning while sleeping,
First, can it be done?

Yes, it can. Psychologists have proved that the brain is
definitely able to assimilate information during sleep. Take, for
instance, a recent experiment conducted by a leading Eastern
university (Stanford). A small tape recorder was placed under
the pillow of the subject, a freshman named tllebe Sigafoos.
When (llebe was fast asleep, the recorder was turned on. Softly,
all through the night, it repeated three statements in (llebe's
slumbering ear:

1. Herbert Spencer lived to the age of 10’.) aml is called “The
Founder of English l‘lclectic Philosophy."

2. The banana plant is not a tree but a large perennial herb

ii. The Archduke li'erdinand was assassinated in Hill at.
Sarajevo by a young nationalist named .\ljilas ('vetnic, who has
been called “The 'l’rigger of World Will" i."

When (llebe awoke in the morning, the [i.~_\'i'lioloi.’,iSlS said to
him, "Herbert Spencer lived to the age of 100. What is he
called?”

fllelie promptly replied, "Perennial Herb."

Next they asked him, "What has Nljilas ( '\'etiiic been called?”

Replied (ilebe, "Perennial Serb."

l’inally they said, “ls. the banana plant. a t.ree""

Hut (llebe, exhausted from the long interrogation, had fallen
back asleep, where he is to this day. « im..u-ti...si...i.......
