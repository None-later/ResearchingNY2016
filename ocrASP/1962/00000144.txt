STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1982

Where Are You Going, Frosh?

A few weeks ago you received your
four weeks grades. Some ofyoumanaged
to get as little as .3 while most others
did much better, fortunately.

As of three weeks ago, even students
with a .3 stood a chance of reaching that
all important “2.0”. After eight weeks
those persons still stand a good chance
of attaining a cumulative average of 1.0.

We urge students to remain and fight
this thing to the bitter end. It will, in
all probability, not be as bitter as most
expect at this point.

Generally speaking, without any major
increase in amount of study time, marks
tend to rise by about .6 between four
weeks marks and the endof the semester.
The person who works at improving his
marks can usually manage a much larger
increase in his quality point index.

This is the ideal semester for im-
proving marks. There will be a long
Christmas—New Year vacation for catch-
ing up on outside readings as well as
your texts.

The main problem you face is re-
maining here for next semester. If you
accomplish this, you will be wellon your
way to graduation.

How are you to stay here? Go to see
the instructor in any and all courses
which are giving you trouble. They are
not ogres. even if they look as if they
are (like at 8:00 in the morning.) They
can help you find a review book or any
one of hundreds of study helps.

See your faculty advisor or your stu—
dent advisor. This program of advisers
was revived this year and the people
involved are very eager to help you.

If you are in a course where there
are old examinations available, getthem.
They are available to others in the

We Endorse :

\\'c have heard many times that the
faculty of the State University at Albany
is radical and the student body is con—
servative. The State College News would
like to commend the faculty this week
on what many non—acaden'iic taxpayers
may consider an example of this “ radi—
calism.”

\\'e refer, of course, to the faculty’s
unanin'tous support of thc right “of the
students and faculty at the State l'niver—
sity oi New York at Buffalo to invite
and listen to speakers of their choice,”
(see page 3)

\\'e, even as “coi‘iservatit'e students,”
feel that inquiry into and understanding

class, why not for you? (Alert colleges
keep old exams on file in the library
so that everyone has an equal chance.
Equalize your chances; this is pp_tcheat—
ing.)

If you have a teacher who has taught
here for a few years, ask people who
have had this person before for informa—
tion on the type of test which is given
or the type of paper the person expects.

if you are taking freshman composi-
tion, proofread your papers and have
someone else proofread them for a check.

Go to your Resident Assistant. if he
or she is helpful, good; if not. use the
person as a hate symbol—disappoint his
or her expectation—by not flanking.

Remember above all else, togiy is
the last day for dropping a course,
without receiving a “W”. if you have a
course which is pulling down your other
marks, go to the Office of the School of
Freshman Studies in Draper room 107.
if you have a course which is taking
half of your study time and if you are
receiving a solid E, you should consider
dropping this course. You have to
maintain only 12 hours.

A few months from now, when you are
still matriculating (although perhaps on
probation), you can take some of the
cinch courses. Youcan findoutthe names
of the teachers. in virtually every field,
who do not flunk people.

All in all, we want to encourage you
to keep trying or in a few odd cases to
start trying (but only if you feel like it)
and to remain in school. Your first
semester is the hardest; if you stick
with it you have an excellent chance of
making it. if you make use of the honest
methods available to you.

The Right to Review
The RADICAL

of all major political ideologies is a
necessary part of cdujation.

The world hears so often that people
must be educated in order to understand
the concepts of democracy and to realize
the inconsistencies and problems in the
theories of (.‘()lllllltlltlh‘lll, Facism and
other alien political theories.

is it not the responsibility of a student
and a college to consider any theory that
is of importance to the student in today’s
world‘,’ \\'c feel that any political con—
cept which threatens the ideals and.
indeed, the life of that student is impor—
tant to him.

no thanks to offer the Sophomores
for Rivalry.

When I first read about Rivalry
in the Handbook, I thought it was a
means of introducing all Freshman
to the traditions of the school, to
the ways of the campus and to the
upperclassmen.

As stated in the Handbook, one
of the specific purposes ofRivalry
is for Freshman to get to knowthe
upperclassmen. particularly the
Sophomores. But how are We to
do this? We are easily recognized
because of our beanics and name—
tags; why don’t the Sophomores
Wear name—tags too, so that we
can get to know them? Perhaps
the theme of next year’s Rivalry
 might be “(letting to Know You."

State Faculty Supports
Board’s Freedom Stand

To Get Money;
Colors Favored

by Joe Galu

The major item on Senate's
agenda was a proposal to appro-
priate up to $1700 for the purchase
of blazers and pants to be used as
uniforms by the Statesmen.

Arthur Putnam ’64. amemberof
Statesman, gave a preliminary ex-
planation of the need for the uni-
forms. The tuxedos now being
used are very old. well worn and
very much out of style.

Mr. Peterson. Associate Pro—
fessor of Music and the conductor
of Statesman, spoke explaining the
role the group fulfills. He men--
tioned the fact that there are at
least 20 concerts planned for the
rest of this year.

Mr. Peterson emphasized the
fact that in their appearances
Statesmen are representing the
school, often to groups which have
no other contact with our institu-
tion.

Money Secured

it was reported that the college
could aid in the purchase only after
the move to the new campus.
Rather than wait for this indefi-
nite future, Senate voted unani-
mously in favor of the proposal
making up to $1700 available for
this very worth while purpose.

As Mr. Peterson excused him—
self before he left, Senate ex-
pressed its appreciation for both
his appearance before them and
his consideration of the wishes of
student government by applauding.

Color Changed

A major procedural Squabble
arose over a proposal that Senate
go on record as favoring a change
in the colors of the college. The
proposed change is from purple
and gold to blue and gold.

The proposal was made in such
a way that came close to offend—
ing many senators. Senate was
given no guarantee that the change

Transfers To Plan
A Social Gathering

by Gladys and Pat

Hi. Transfer!

Wha’ hoppen? I mean on Mon—
day, October 29 at 3:00 there was
a meeting for all interested trans—
fer students, but most of you
weren’t there.

In case you’re still in the dark.
here's the scoop: many of us feel
that future transfers could benefit
by having some guidance, similar
to that of the Freshman entrants,
in learning the ropes here at Al—
bany State.

As stated in our proposed Con-
stitution the purpose of the Trans-—
fer Association will be “to aid the
transfer student in acquainting
himself with the traditions. regu-
lations. a e a de mic requirements
and various clubs and organiza—
tions available to him asamember
of the state University community.

This purpose will be fulfilled
through social functions, which will
also serve to introduce him to the
eXIsting student body.”

At present we are planning to
have a get—together sometime in
the near future. For further in-
formation pleaSe consultthis paper
and your mailboxes in the Com-
mons. The Commons is that room
under Richardson Hall—the room
Where you purchased all those
textbooks.

In case you're still in doubt,
just follow your nose through the
peristylc (a tunnel under thebuild-
ings) in a westerly direction and
bear left by the soda pop machine.
Also keep your eyes open for pos—
ters concerning the Transfer As—
sociation as well as those of other
campus events.

Hope to see you at our next

would be made or when the change
would be made.

It was suggested that the athletic
teams are in the process ofchang-
ing the colors for their uniforms.
Their was nothing definite in this
statement.

Several senators voiced theii
opposition to the proposal which
included both changing the colors
and requiring that the university
shield appear on official things like
any banner.

Action by Rulu

There was much understandable
confusion as to what “official”
means and when the color change
would be made. It was pointed
out that Senate has no control over
the color change and that the
proposal is only an expression of
agreement.

A vote was taken and the motion
was carried by a vote of 18 hands
to 16. A senator objected and
asked for a polling of the Senate.
i.e. a roll call vote.

The parliamentary rules were
in the process of being checked
when a vote of hands as asked to
see if Senate favored being polled.
Lenny Lapinski '64 rose to a
point of order and pointed out that
Senate had to be polled if one
member demands it.

Senate was polled and the result
was a 17-17 tie. After much in-
vestigation into rules. Student As—
sociation President S. Steven Con—
dojani cast the deciding vote in
favor of the measure.

The last major action of the
meeting was the acceptance of a
report by Recreation MinisterJohn
Lilga ’64.

Campus Queen

(Continued From Page 1)

tity will remain a secret until the
official announcement tonight by
Rivalry Chairman Fred Smith.

Campus Day Queen was initiated

nation of Ethel Rush. The original
purpose was to honor the most
popular girl in the Senior Class by
crowning her queen to reign over
the campus activities of the com—
ing year. In 1934. the idea of a
Campus Queen changed to include
beauty. poise. personality, and
popularity.

selected from the five finalists
competing for the title of Campus
Queen.

The attendants from the Junior.
Sophomore and Freshman Classes
were selected by Fred Smith. Fred
Rawe, Bob Fairbanks, Dick Kelly.
Steve (‘ondojani, and Howie Wood—
ruff.

Those girls elected by their
classes are. Juniors: Piret Kutt.
Sue Murphy, Helen Mandeville.
Veronica (lillis, Marlee Sorenson,

State’s Outing Club
Ventures To Many
Scenic Area Spots

by Tom Satterlee

During the past three weeks the
Albany State Outing Club has ven—
tured far. On Oct. 20, we went to
Knox Caverns in Schoharie County,
and found members of the National
Speleological Society about to do
mappings and studies of the cave.
The N.S.S. informed us of two
more caves in the area to explore
another time.

The following weekend repre—
sentatives of the A.S.t).C. visited
the New Paltz College Camp for
the Hudson Valley Regional Con»
ference. Hereclubmembershiked
and canoed with ()uting Clubbers
from New Paltz, Skidmore. \'as~
sar, R.P.l,, Princeton, and other
colleges. After a delicious variety
of meals. there was square danc—
ing and folk singing.

Bright and early on Saturday.
Nov. 3. eleven members left for
Dippikill and climbed Crane Mt.
in the afternoon tobogganing, work-
ing on the camp, and roasting in
front of the fireplace were under-
taken.

Participants in these activities
included Carl Walton. Tobias l’ol—
green. Ruth Whiting, Walt Swindell,

F NOTICE i

The (iraduatiop fee of $19 will
be collected from all students
graduating in January of 1963.
Monday, November 12 through Fri—
day, November 16.

All applications for degrees
must be filed with the Registrar
not later than January 1. 1963.

 

Last Monday the faculty of State
University at Albany voted unani-
mously to support Mr. Frank C.
Moore, Chairman of the State Uni—
versity of New York Board of
Trustees, on his and the Board's
stand on the current situation con-
cerning academic freedom at the
University of Buffalo.

This situation developed through
the University’s scheduling of a
series of speakers representing
five political ideologies — fascism.
conservatism, liberalism. social-
ism and communism. The final
speaker in the series was to be
Herbert Aptheker, a member of
the committee of the Communist
Party.

Muhoney Protests

On Monday, October 29. the
Board of Trustees refused a re-
quest by State Senator Walter J.
Mahoney of Buffalo that the Board
prohibit Aptheker’s appearance.

A court injunction outlawing Ap-
theker’s talk was granted upon the
action of William W. Egan, Dem—
ocratic candidate for Congress.
Egan objected to the Board’s de—
cision as “uh-American.”

Although the Board was forced
to postpone Aptheker’s address. it
intends to fight the court order.
Mr. Moore stated. “'l‘heissue here
is not Communism northe speaker,
but the right of a university, its
students and faculty, as a part of
their educational process. to ex-

 

PAGE 3

amine and compare various politi-
cal ideologies directly, including
the right to examine doctrines as
loathsome as Communism.

Freedom of Inquiry

“We shall continue to defend the
lawful freedom of inquiry that an
academic community must possess
if it is to maintin an education
program of strength and depth.

“We cannot determine, in good
conscience. that it is the function
of a university to so pick and
choose as to bar from open forum
with students and faculty those
individuals whose views. however
warped, may not coincide with the
views of the men and women gov-
erning a university at any partic-
ular time.

“We have confidence that our
students, with proper guidance and
assistance. can listen. question and
cope with the proponents of all
political philosophies, separate
truth from fallacy and through
knowledge based on independent
inquiry adhere to and even more
effectively support the fundamental
beliefs which are basic to a strong
America."

In their resolution the faculty
of State University at Albany
stated to Mr. Moore, “\\'e are, of
course, concerned whenever the
principles of academic freedom
are threatened. \I'e endorse the
statement, and we commend you
and the Board for your stand.”

'Heavyweight’ Uses Camera
In Skillful Subiective Fashion

by Paul Jensen

A film technique that can be
either extremely effective or ter—
ribly ludicrous. depending on the
skill with which it is executed. is
the one that was occasionally used
during Requiem for a Heavyweight.

This technique is basically one
utilizing a subjective camera. The
lens becomes the eye of a charac—
ter. in this case a boxer named
Mountain Rivera. and as a result
the individuals in the audience see
everything that happens to him in
the first person, as if it was actu—
ally happening to them.

Last Fight

The several scenes placed be—
fore the opening credits are done
in this manner. as are one or two
scenes near the end. As Rivera.
in his last fight, is battered by
his opponent, knocked unconscious
and finally brought to the locker
room. the audience becomes. in
effect. the fighter.

When used sparingly and with
technical proficiency. as it is in
this picture. the process becomes
tremendously effective in creating
empathy for the main character.

Indeed. empathy is what is
wanted in this film. It is the story
of a man. an ugly, battered iigiitcr

Married Couples
To Meet Monday

()ne of the most difficult proli-
lems facingayoung marriedcouple
in this academic community is
finding the time and the means of
making the acquaintances of intel—
lectually ale rt and interesting
young couples. The problem has
been solved.

Last Friday evening, llrubaeher
Hall was host to the first meeting
of a new group.

A married couples club has
been formed and is a group dedi—
cated t0 the principle that there is
a place in the social and intellec—
t'ial life of this campus for the
mature, responsible married ele—
ment of the student body.

The club welcomes student iii—
terest and is eager to include new
friends from both the faculty and
student body.

The next club meeting will be
held Monday evening at 8:00 in
Brubacher Hall, and new members
are invited.

\\'hen he is warned by a doctor
that another fight will probably
cause blindness. he is at a loss ——
deprived of the only thinghe knows
how to do. Although he is offered
the job of instructor at a boys’
camp. through his manager’s ef—

forts he eventually becomes a
wrestler.
The film, though. is not as

much a story about boxing as it is
about people and their need and
search for dignity.

Rivera. although nearly an iii-
articulate brute. is still a human
being, proud of never having taken
a dive in his 111 fights. and of
having almost been the heavy-
weight champ, When he is refused
jobs because of his scars and
awkward manner. it is a blow to
his pride.

Dignity Maintained

Anthony t,itiiiiii’s jxirtrayal oi

Ralph Nelson’s direction gives
the story a fine. realistic atmos-

of compassionate humor. There is
some violence in the film, but
there ls also pathos. tenderness.

Never maudlin or overly-senti—

Not a classic, it is, however, a
moving, significant experience.
