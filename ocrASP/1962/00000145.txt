Do Teachers of the Future
Need New Sell - Evaluation?

by Don de Fano

l was at a newsstand yesterday
and heard an amusing but some-
what frightening comment by the
proprietor. ln explaining why the
hapless Morgenthau would lose the
race for Governor, the denier re-
marked that the challenger suf-
fered because he was too much like
a “school teacher.” How effec-
tively that dismissed the Demo-
crat.

This set me to thinking about
the old question of why teachers
present such a poor corporate
image. however sharp they might
be individually. This reminded
me again that the dismal picture
begins here with us. Perhaps,
sandwiched in with the discus-
sion of such questions as whether
potential flunkees make good stu—
dent representatives. we might
broach the question of what sort
of responsibility the teacher has,
and to whom?

First of all let it be said that
the teacher has a dual, and para—
doxical, relationship with the com-
munity. He must challenge and
stimulate his charges in sucha way
as to prepare them for effective
participation in a hostile andcom—
plicated world. At the same time
the community, which expects this
preparation, often does as much as
it can to protect its children from
those same hostilities andcompli-
cations.

Secondly, the teacher has an
ambivalent responsibility to his
colleagues. Or. the one hand he
must support a united effort for
decent salaries and moderate se-
curity, for this method is the only
successful way to deal in a col-
lectivistic economy such as ours;
but by supporting such an approach
he sustains much “dead—wood” in
the profession (or trade). and thus
mitigates the image ofthc teacher.

Finally, as an individual the
teacher has to maintain his self—
respect. Ultimately this means
that he must be forthrightandslow
to compromise. But compromise
is the most common commodity in
the teaching game.

it is time for us to wake up to

the fact that our student-centered
environment is ephemeral. We are
the ones who will either continue
the endless chain of placid, un—
inspiring graduates; or break with
tradition. and also with the un-
fortunate (however apt) image
which that tradition demands.

Group Slates
T.A. Rich

One of the more rewarding as—
pects of college life is the chance
we all have to hear outstanding
men lecture on topics not covered
in the classroom. By attending
the various lectures presented
throughout the year, students are
given the opportunity to broaden
their background; science majors
can be enlightened in the arts; and
conversely, arts majors can be
enlightened in science. In the past,
men such as Dr. Alfred Garrett.
Ellie Ley, and Dr. Ralph Lapp
have presented informative and
interesting talks on matters of
science and technology.

Today, at 1 p.m. in D—349, the
Science Colloquium, headed by
Dr. Allen. Chairman of the Chem-
istry Department, will present a
speaker who will continue this
standard of quality. He is Mr. 'l‘.A.
Rich, a Consulting Engineer of the
(leneral Electric Company. His
topic willbe“'l‘raininglnventors.”

Mr. Rich is a graduate of liar-
vard University (1930) where he
majored in Electrical Engineer-
ing. While still a student at Har-
vard. he received an engineering
award for the development of an
electric tachometer which meas—
ures the speed of aircraftengines.
Since that time he has specialized
in instrumentation and has (level—
oped many important dcvices. He
holds 84 patents oninstrumcnts for
measurement, control and detec—
tion purposes.

This event is not only an op—
portunity to hear a Worthwhile
lecture, but since it is a col—
loquium (Latin for conversation),
it is an excellent time to ask
pertinent questions in the area of
the subject discussed.

with his vcry profound thoughts.

Government Reorganization Committee looks Ahead

Government Reorganization Committee is a Senate
committee composed of the following members: Pat
Cerra ’63, Chairman; Mary Margaret \V'elker ’65,
Secretary: Candy DalPan ’63, George Lomaga ’65,
Marlee Sorenson ’64, Art Johnston ’65, Harold Hanson
’63 and Mr. William McKinnon, Student Union Director.
The job of the committee is to reorganize our present
form of student government into a new and more ex—

 

ﬁan I Suggests
Modification

Of Present Form

The duty, as conceived by the
unicameral subcommittee, was to
draw up a plan of government
essentially embracing the present
form of student government. The
only revisions considered or made
were those which were thought
would strengthen the government
on the present and future campus.

Revisions and Problems

Some revisions and problems
encountered are discussed. Should
class representation be cqual'.’ A
traditional concept of democratic
government is that each group
should have political power com—
mensurate to its number.

Should the Senior class of 592
students have as many senators as
the freshman ciassof777 students?
The subcommittee thought not, and
thereforc provided a system of
representation that. would givc each
class a basic number of senators
plus additional senators inpropor-
tion to class number. in effect
this would reflch the true political
and tax-payingpon-rofeach class.

Should Mysltania Bo Changed?

The very citadel of tradition on
our campus, (a campus wherctra—
dition plays an expanded mic) is
Myskania. Unique to our campus
is this judicial and honorary body.

it is argued that a democratic
government should not embrace
such a Judiciary. Hut Myskania
servcs ihc college in maintaining
and supporting our traditions along
with judic'ai service. The sub—
coirimittcc has i-nvisioncd no
change either in tho form or role
of Myskania in tho ncar fuiurc,
although certain changcs mayhaVc
to lli‘ madc.

many very helpful and detailed
criticisms filtered back to the
committee and they were used
conscientiously in future planning.
Rounding out these were the tra-
ditional sources of American gov-
ernment and democracy.

Therefore, the subcommittees
were not lackingin suggestions and
ideas that could have been used
for revision.

This Somut-r and Future

Work so far this semester has
been concentrated on completion
and perfection of each subcommit-
toc’s plan. The committee has
now reached a point where selec—
ion will be made on the basic
itructure of the new government
akcn from one of tllt‘ three basic
plans.

This basic structure will be
modificd by taking the good points
of the othc r two and mergingtlicm,
forming a new, concise, andwork—
able gchrnmcnt.

The next step will be to [)l‘t‘St‘lll
the committee’s product to mom-
burs of the administration and
faculty for ideas, suggestions and
criticisms. After filial adjust—
nicnts and revisions, the final pro—
duct will be brought bcfore Senate
for its approval.

Will the Proposed Plan Work?

The committee fuels that their
proposal will work and work bct—
tcr as a student government. liut,
ilic great element in this question
is timc. ihe futuri- holds many
iinfori-sccii cvenls, questions, and
problems that will test thc ingenu-
ity of students in their Si'lil‘t‘li tor
answcrs.

in closing, it should be said that
a govcrnment on paper may be the
best as could be devised by man,
but it would utterly fail for wall
of active student participation.

Bicameral Plan
Stresses Two-
House Branch

The Reorganization Commit-
tee’s second plan is a bicameral
form of student government. The
legislative branch is to consist of
a Senate with elected representa—
tives from the various chartered
organizations on campus.

Distinction:

The Senate is planned to be a
policy making body, and the As—
sembly a “work horse" body. The
Judicial branch will consist of a
high Supreme Court with 13 judges
and provision is made for a sys—
tem of lower courts.

Executive Department

The Executive Department con-
sists of a President, a first Vice—
l’resident (President of Senate), a
second Vice—President (President
of Assembly), and a Treasurer.

Board of Advisers

’l‘o correlate the Executive
branch with the Legislative, the
President will have a Board of
Advisors, with the members of the
Executive branch and a represen—
tative from each of the depart—
ments in the Assembly on the
Board.

This plan calls for a number of
Changes in our present plan that
can easily be instituted.

University will be moving
to a new campus where,
with a bigger campus and a

larger student body, the demands
of students individually and en
masse will augmcnt trcmendously
in relation to those present.

in order to mcci these de—
mands, Student (kivcrnnicnt must
also change, modify and adapt it—
self. it is thc t-xpri-ssed job of
this committee to forsei- these
necessary changes and to formu-
late an cffectivc and workabli- plan
of government for use on our new
campus.

er it was formed last i-‘ebri.iary,
