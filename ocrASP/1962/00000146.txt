State Booters End Season at Home Tomorrow Afternoon

 

Harriers Close Season
With Exhibition Meet

At Bleecker Wednesday

For the first time in two years
State’s Cross-Country team dis-
played its talents in a home meet
at lllecker Stadium last Wednesday
night. The l’cds, their regular
season over, ran an infra—squad
exhibition meet during the half-
time of the Albany-li.l’.l. soccer
tilt.

Coach Munsey ran the firstyenr
men against the second year men.
The first year men, out for blood,
edged the more experienced run—
ners 9—10. State's X—Cers were
slated to run againstliudson Valley
C.C., but a death in the family of
one of the Viking‘s men forced
them to bow out.

While the lettcrmen's squadwas
paced by State’s number one l’ed,
Tom Robinson, they had some
pretty still competition in the
larger, determined second year
team.

For the first three laps of the
10 lap. 3.2 mile run things looked
good for the challengers. l’ed
Dennis Tuttle held the lead and a
battle for third was being waged
between letterman Hill Bronson
and John Clark. in the far turn
of the fourth lap itobinson took the
lead, which he held forthe duration
of the race.

Robinson Wins Again

With some 200 State rooters
looking on, Tom Robinson l)1‘()k(‘
the tape in 19 minutes 58 seconds.
Scoring first for the second year
squad was Dennis Tuttle, copping
the second spot with 20:21. Nail-
ing down third for the lettcrmcn
was Bill Bronson in 20:40. The
next two spots went to the “under-
dogs” with John Clark finishing
fourth and Pep l’izzillo fifthclock—
ing 22:20 and 22:30 respectively.

Stevo ilolcski, lettcrman, was
sixth with 22:40. Following him
were: Dick Sarnowski seventh in
22:48, Sylvanus Nyokaya eighth

in 23: 17, Chuck Mastrangelo ninth
in 23:36 and Guy McBride tenth in
24:54.

State’s Cross—Country team
brought down the curtain on its
regular season, bowing to New
Paltz 22-34, last Saturday.

in an almost blinding sleet and
rain storm State’s Harriers gotoff
to a poor start and the New Paltz
men took an early lead. The Feds
found it impossible to recover on
the extremely slippery 4.8 mile
course. At least two of State’s
X—Cers lost their footing in the
turns, losing precious seconds and
probably the meet.

Robinson Undefeated

The l’ed’s number one son Tom
Robinson took first place in 24
minutes and 32 seconds. despite
two wrong turns and a downed flag
which caused him to lose about 100
of his 130 yard load. Tom edged
New l’altz’s “Kenya Comet”, Ja-
sen Nykariki, by :3 seconds to re-
main undefeated in srx dual meet
Starts.

New Paltz Clinches Meet

\\ith Nykariki holding second
place, New l’altz’s l’rank Miata,
liddie Szysmanski and Bill Marin-
accio strode through the traps in
third, fourth and fifth places
clocking 25:10, 25:50 and 26:17
respectively. State’s second and
third scoring llari'iers were ilcn-
nis 'l‘uitle, sixth turning 26:26 and
llill Bronson seventh with 26:43.
The last scoring Now l’altz liar-
ricr to cross the line was Ki'nncth
llnrr copping the i-ighth spot in 27
flat.

Stati' frosh John t‘lark snaple

Frosh Kickers
Go Winless

The freshman soccer team fin-
ished its roughest season in four
years by dropping its final two
games of the season to Orange
County and Colgate, finishing the
season with a 0—8 record. How-
ever, in all fairness to the team
it should be noted that this was
perhaps the toughest schedule ever
faced by any freshman soccer
team.

Against the Orange County team
the Feds played their best half of
the year, holding the finest two
year college soccer team score—
less, much to the latter’s sur—
prise. A big factor in this score
was George Guddat’s holding
Orange County’s star player to no
goals. However, the Orange Coun—
ty team was able to break loose
in the second half, and led by ar
all foreign forward poundedin four
goals in both the third and fourth
periods for a final score of 8—0.

In the final game of the season
the fresh hooters dropped a tough
game to a good Colgate freshman
team by a score of 6-2. At the
half the frosh fell behind 3—0, and
at the outset of the third period
Colgate upped its lead to 4-0.
The fresh thenbattledback to lower
the score to 4-2 on goals by their
two wings, Jake Ndimbo (right
wing) and Tom Jones (left wing).
The hosts came back, however,
twice in the final moments to ice
the game. Outstanding forColgate
was their left wing who scored
three goals and who was the best
wing seen by Albany all year. The
Albany team played poor defensive
during the game and was hindered
by a lack of good checking by the
lines. The teamwas alsohampered
by its inability to take advantage
of many of its scoring opportun—
ities.

Albany to Face Brockport
In Big Homecoming Game

State’s varsity soccer team will bring down the
curtain on its 1962 campaign tomorrow, in the big
Home—coming game with Brockport. The game will
begin at 2:00 p.m. on the College Playing Field, and
will be preceded by the traditional parade. It is
hoped that a large crowd will turn out to cheer the
Feds on to victory in their last appearance of the year.

Beuudin leads Ped
Keglers to 3-1 Win

Paul Beautiin, throwing a big
ball at the right time, fired a fine
206-551 to lead State to a 3—1 vic—
tory over A.B.C. in the C.i).l.C.
bowling loop. The team bounced
back from last week's 4" defeat
at the hands of the Owls to win a
139 pin decision, losing only the
second game by a slim margin of
18 pins.

Following Beaudin in the pin
parade were Dave ltoegner with
184—531, Jim (littleman with 204—
529, and Al Sabo whocame through
with an important spare by con—
verting thc difficult 6—7 split. The
match was exciting and close,
much closct‘ than the victory mar—
gin indicates. State couldn’t quite
stay even in thr- sccond game as
.»\.il.L. got one point due to the
fine bowling of Chuck Brown who
totaled 547 for the night.

\\'ith this narrow victory. the
l’eds were able to retaintheirbold
on third place in the league. At
the present time, the red»hot ltl’i
keglers are the pace-sette rs, while
the Indians from Siena hold the
second spot.

The Peds now own a 13-11
record on the season, which puts
them far above last year’s l).'li‘t’.
