Group Debates Freedom;
Miles Takes Senate Oath

by Barbara Townsend

The first order of business on
the agenda was the appointment of
Jim Miles as the new Junior class
Senator. S. A. President Steve
Condojani administered the oath of
office.

Bonnie Batchelor ’64 chairman
of Constitution Committee brought
up the question of the necessity of
Senate recognition of allorgnniza—
tions on campus. Senate Recogni—
tion is given to a group if it sub-
mits a constitution which is ap-
proved by Senate.

S.A. President Steve Condojnni
stated that it is not the “privilege
of a group but obligation to be
recognized.”

Constitutional Question

The question of whcthcr or not
the SA. Constitution specifically
asked for a constitution fromcvcry
organization was raised. The Con—
stitution does not definitely ask for
group constitutions.

The general consensus ofScnntc
was that aconstitution is necessary
for i'ccognition. But since it is :1
“question of inicrprctntion", the
matter was turned over to Con—
stitution Committcc for furthcr
investigation.

Pnt Ccrrn ’64 chairman of (lov-
crnmcnt licoi‘gzmiznlion Commit—
tcc i'cpoi'tcd that his committee
has c voch d :1 plan for a new
system of s tudc nt govm‘nmcni.
'l‘his plun uscs :is its basis the
bi—cumcrnl logislntivr- systc m.
'l‘hc plan should bc complcicd be—
fore March.

Libby Stroud ’64 i‘cpoi‘lcd on
the Confederation of Student (iov-
crnmcnts meeting held lust Sutur—
day. She was l‘nihcr bittcr in her
comments as to thc conduct of the
meeting.

Freedom of Speech

She introduced a resolution
which stated that the Confedera-
tion “encourages the principle of
complete autonomy [for all mem-
bers of the Confederationjover
selecting and contracting of a
speaker” at the respective schools.

The resolution “gives the power
to the student government [of the
schoolsj to choose and contract
whatever speaker they want.”

Discussion

John ’l‘yo, S.A. Vice—President.
said that our support of thc reso—
lution would mean that “we believe
freedom of speech should exist on
our campus.”

Steve Borges ’63 spoke fervent—
ly in opposition to Senate's pos—
sible support of thc Conference’s
resolution. He said “A Yes vote.
means you are voting for Com—
munism.”

'l‘ony l)i liocco ’64 said that a
No vote would mean that “...wc
are becoming no better than the
Communists themselves.”

Pat (‘crrn ’04 moved the previ-
ous question. it was passed and
Senate approved (not unanimously)
thc rcsrdution.

Interest

A motion was made and passed
to put ihc $35,000 from Camp
Board’s (‘npiinl Construction fund
and all futurc moncy from Capital
Construction lines in :1 bank in
order to collect inicrcst on tho
moncv.

Mary Mill‘g‘ \\‘elkcr ’65 made a
resolution [but Scnntc “reconsider
the motion about chnnging school
colors.” It was felt that not
enough ini'orn'mtion was known
about the subject when the motion
was passed last week. ’l‘hc motion
was passed and the resolution
tabled until next week’s mccting.
