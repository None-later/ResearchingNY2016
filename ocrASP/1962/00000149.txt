STATE COLLEGE NEWS, FRIDAY, numb" l" 19“

Dr. Herring Views Current
Problems inLatin America

On Monday, at 1p.m.. the Forum
of Politics presented Dr. Hubert
Herring, Professor of Latin Amer—
ican Civilization at Pomona Col—
lege and Clare mont Graduate
School, who spoke on The Chips Are
Down For Latin America. The au—
thor of numerous books on Latin
America, Dr. Herring spoke to a
near capacity audience in Draper
349, and drew on his many years
of travel in the area, and his
studies of it.

The briefest of historical sur—
veys. With attention to the develop-
ment of Inter-American relations,
was followed by a lucid and pene—
trating examination of the prob-
lems which face Latin America
today, and how they affect the
United States.

History at Dictators

Latin America has a deeply
rooted history of dictatorships and
intervention by the United States
in its internal affairs and has no
background of workable democ-
racy. 'l‘he countries seem prone
to new dictatorships. of the. left
and of the right, in an attempt to
solve their immense problems,

After a discussion of the prob—
lems of population explosion, eco—
nomic thVt‘ltipnlt‘nl, food supply,
and social stratification as they
affect Latin America, the speaker
proceeded to that nation to the
South which has i‘t‘t‘t‘lw’tl so much
attention in the last few weeks—
Cuba.

He discussed the history of the
Caribbean island. particularly in
respect to l'nited States policy
toward it, and its history ofdic—
tatorship.

Although this country helped to
free Cuba from the Spanish, and
controlled it for some ycal‘S af-
terward, Cuba has developed a
hostility toward the [‘iiited States
which is echoed in most of the
nations of Latin America.

Rise of Castro

Cuba’s long succession of dic—
tators culminated with Batista,
who received American support for
much of his rule. Culminating in
the rise of Castro, who gained
power under the guise of a libe. rate r
from oppression, he hasturnedthe
island into a Communist dictator-
ship and has married its economy
with that of the iron t‘ui‘lain na—
lions.

Dr. Herring made clear that the
Cuban crisis is far from ovci', and
pointcd out that Castro—like rev—
olutions are a distinct possibility
in other parts of Latin America.

since the murder of Trujillo, and
the volatile Venezuelan situation
were noted, as was the abject pov-
erty found in northeastern Brazil,
and around every major South
American city.

in response to questions from the
floor, Dr. Herring noted that the
Alliance for Progress was a step
in the. right direction. To avert
disaster, he said it would have to
be accompanied by tax and land
reforms as well as by steps to
lessen mass illiteracy in Latin
America.

Book Reviewer

Dr. Herring, who regularly re—
views books on Latin America for
the New York Herald Tribune, said
that none of the. recent crop ofbooks
on Cuba was really very good.

Dr. Herring said that the recent
rcawakcning of interest in Latin
America in the United Stateswasa
good sign, and seemed to feel that
there was some hope for the future
of the lands to the South.

New York

Gerrymandering Plans

by Joseph Galu

The congressional races in New
York State provided one of the
most interesting studies of poll-
tics, gerrymandering, and per—
sonalities seen in many years.

The old line up of New York’s
delegation was 22 Democrats and
21 Republicans. Due to this state’s
slow growth in population New York
lost two congressional seats.

Emergency Session

in drawing the new lines for 41
districts three days after the re-
election of New York City Mayor
Robert F. Wagner. Jr. thelcgisla—
lure, under Republican rule, at—
tempted to draw 25 districts for
themselves.

Such a division was attempted.
A Democratic district upstate was
divided, two Democratsin Manhat—
tan were eliminated and one in
Kings County (Brooklyn) was re—
drawn extensively.

'l‘wo new Republican districts
were created in Long island. This
would have led to a line up of 18
Dci‘nocrats and 23 Republicans.
However, in additiontwootherdis—
tricts, one including Staten island
and part of Kings and one in
Queens, were changed.

Hopeful Outlook

The result was supposedtobc 16
Democrats and ‘15 Democrats. (in
Novcmbc r 6 the voters decided they
liked ’30 Democrats and '21 Repub-
iicans.

in some ways the gerrymander
of New York’s districts was a
great success: in other places it
fell apart coriiplctcly.

The difference between what was
expected by the Republicans and
what happened can be accountcdfo r
by four upsets. The names in—
volved arc Samuel S. Stratton,()lis
(i. Pike, John M. Murphy aiidilugh
1.. Carey.

Sam Stratton pulled his upset in
upstate New York. His old dis'
trict was devidcd thrcc ways. He
chose to run in the portion which
includes Montgomery and ()tscg‘o
counties.

Bitter Primary

in addition the district has Che—
nango, Cortland, Cayuga, Seneca,
Yates and Ontario counties. A\fter
a very close and bitter prin'iary
state Senator Janet liili li()l‘tl()il
became the Republican candidate.

She was expected to win six or
seven counties and carry the dis—
trict by it) or 13 thousand votes.
Strattoii won by morc than 13,000
votes and carried five out ol eight
counties.

The second biggest upset was in
staunchly Republican Suffolkt‘oun-
ty. Dcriiocrat (itis ti. i’ikc won a
second term. in lUtil) his district
was the lut‘g‘cSt in the state in
population and in 1961 was divided
into two districts.

., lues.,

The other two upsets were much
closer. The winners, Carey and
Murphy ran from new district
numbers 15 and 16.

Close Races

These carefully drawn districts
contain only 349,850 and 352,024
people compared to 469,908 and
454,285 for their Democratic
neighbors. Carey won by 878 votes
while Murphy won by 1,740.

But despite these four setbacks,
this did not entirely negate the ef—
forts of the gerrymander makers.
in the Bronx, redrawing of the
lines for Republican Representa—
tive Paul A. Fine gave him a
larger pluralty than ever before
despite his strongest opposition in
years.

in Queens, Seymour iialpern re—
ceived 55.67 of the vote in 1960.
in his new district his percentage
was 63.3.

Minority Rule
The best example of success in
the field of gerrymandering 'anbc
seen by examining the Buffalo
arca -— i-Iric aiidNiagara Counties.
This area is divided into three
congressional districts.
'l‘wo weeks ago the voters cast
their votes as follows:

Democrats 216,540
Republicans 209,137
Liberals 3,694

The gerrymandering of the Buf-
l‘alo area gave the Republicans 2
of the 3 congressmen. Dulski—i)
received 71.49}; Miller—R, 51.5;
and l’illion-R 62.5.

Despite a good deal of success
the voters voted in such a way
that 18 counties are represented
by Democrats instead of only 14
as in 1960.

Many Events
Added Bounce
To Homecoming

by Dave Jonks

Showing once again an ever in—
creasing schedule of events and
activities. State whirled its way
through the annual Homecoming
Weekend. Soccer games. recep-
tions, jazz concerts. parades. all—
star football games and dances
packed tightly in with anefficiently
run Campus Night indicated that
State is leaving the days of one—
event weekends.

A few short hours after Friday’s
last wearying class, the Home-
coming “rocket” had blasted its
first stage ~ Campus Night.

An efficiently run program by
Rivalry Chairmen, Fred Smith, got
underway with the announcement
of Pam Carter as Campus Queen.

Court

She and her also beautifulcourt,
consisting ofSeniors Pat \Voinoski,
and Mary Lou iiisenman: Juniors
Pirct Kutt, and Sue Murphy;Sopho-
mores Nancy Baumann. andCarole
Harvey; and freshmen Joan Thom—
sen, and Olga Sarupicius, watched
over the rcmainderofthe program.

Directed by Jim Lobdell, the
freshmen danced, sang, and joked
their way through a very pleasant
production entitled “My Fair Co—
ed”. it was a light interesting
story of a farm girl coming to
State as a freshmen. A suave and
knowing sophomore attempts, on a
bet. to make her a well adjusted.
socially accepted girl.

Between skits, Roz Ferrara, and
Art Putnam and Libby Stroud kept
the audience in its activated state
by presenting two laugh provoking
routines.

“Julie and Cleo”, the Soph skit,
then be Jame the ccnterof attention
as Lee Liss directed the second
year forces in a parody of George
Bernard Shaw’s “Caesar and Cleo-
patra.” 'I‘he skit was written by
Pat l“asano and displayed some
interesting humor.

CAIT Court

(irccted by a plentiful wave of
boo’s and hiss’s, CAi'i‘ Court was
revealed to many anxious fresh—
men. The Rivalry court of justice
included Seniors Joe La Monica
and Doris ltluhlich; Juniors Libby
Stroud and Dick Pierce; Sophs lid
\t'olner, and (trace Carbonaro; Al—
ternates Carol Colway and Art
Johnston; and Myskania member
tieri Schlcifer.

The moment had arrived, the
culmination point of eight strenu-
ous but fun—filled weeks of Soph—
t'rosh competition, and without lur—
thcr adieu, lt‘rcd Smith announced
that the winner of the skit and
Rivalry was the Class of 196:3.

'l'cars of joy and of disappoint—
ment were soon wipcd away and
minds shifted to the next segment
of the tightly packed schedule —
Homecoming.

Rain

Saturday morning dawned to the
drip—drop of a cold rain and it ap-
peared as it (once again for the
third ycai' in tour) Statc was going
to haw- a rain drenched grcctiiig
for the grads.

iiowcvcr, it cleared and alter a
second burst of pcrclpitatioii,
cleared once again for the soccer
game. the game wasplnycdunder
dry conditions and at least abovc
the ground.

Brockport, whoiuisplaycd all but
two of its games in the rain,
proved to be too much for a hard
playing State squad. 'i‘hcy scored
one goal in the first half undone
iii the second and were able toliold
our offense scoreless to capture
a 2—0 victory.
