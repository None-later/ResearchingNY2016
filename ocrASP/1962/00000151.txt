COMMITTEES:
AN AGONIZING RE-APPRAISAL

To those of you who stay out of your student government
because you believe the committee system is just an excuse
for inaction, let me cite an example to prove that a committee,
properly led and directed, can be a great force for good.

Last week the Student Council met at the Duluth College
of Veterinary Medicine and Belles Lettres to discuss purchasing
a new doorrrrat for the students union. It was, I assure you, a
desperate problem because Sherwin K. Sigafoos, janitor of the
students union, threatened flatly to quit unless a new doormat
was installed immediately. “I’m sick and tired of mopping that
dirty old floor,” said Mr. Sigafoos, sobbing convulsively. (Mr.
Sigafoos, once a jolly outgoing sort, has been crying almost
steadily since the recent death of his pet wart hog who had
been his constant companion for 22 years. Actually, Mr. Sigafoos
is much better off without the wart hog, who tusked him
viciously at least once a day, but a companionship of 22 years
is, I suppose, not lightly relinquished. The college tried to give
Mr. Sigafoos a new wart hog~a frisky little fellow with ﬂoppy
ears and a wageg tail—but Mr. Sigafoos only turned his back
and cried the harder.)

liter/rim” lis' tam/nit  on

But I digress. The Student Council met, discussed the door-
mat for eight or ten hours, and then referred it to a committee.
There were some who scoffed then and said nothing would
ever be heard of the doorrnat again, but they reckoned without
Invictus Millstone.

lnyictus Millstone, chairman of the doorrnat committee,
was a man of action—~lithe and lean and keen and, naturally, a
smoker of Marlboro Cigarettes. ery do I say “naturally”?
lira-ause, dear friends, active men and women don’t have time
to brood and humble about their cigarettes. They need to be
certain. They must have perfect confidence that each time they
light up they will get the same gratifying flavor, the same
Selectrate filter, the same soft soft-pack, the sairie flip top
flip-top box. in brief, dear friends, they need to be sure it's
Marlboro » forifever a smoke was trueand trusty, it's Marlboro.
(let some soon. (let matches too, because true and trusty
though Marlboros are, your pleasure will be somewhat limitcd
unless you light them.

Well sir, lnvictus Millstonc chaired his doormat committcc
with such vigor and dispatch that whcn .nc Student ('ouncil
mot only onc wcck later, he was able to rise and dclivcr the
following rccirmmcndations:

1. That thc collcgc build new schools of botany, hydraulic
cnginccring, tropical medicine, lrulo—(icrmanic languages, amt
millincr'y.

2. 'l‘hat thc collcgc drop football, put a roof on thc stadium.
and turn it into a low-cost housing projcct for marricd students.

3. That the collcgc I'itlH' faculty salaries by $5000 per ycar
across the board.

4. That thc collcgc scccdc from thc l'nitcd States.

systcm. it can bc madc to work! r am Momma-mu

You don't need a committee to tell you how good Marlboron
are. You just need yourself, a Marlboro, and a set of taste
buds. Buy some filarllmron noon at your favorite tobacco
counter.

Father Starks Criticizes
Speakers and Publications

by Linda White

The Rev. Donald L. Starks, Moderator of The New-
manite, expressed disagreement with the State Univer-
sity Board of Trustee’s stand on speaker autonomy
as stated in the November 11 edition of the State College
News. in his editorial which appeared in the November
edition of The Newmanito, Father Starks stated that one
would be following a “philosophy of expediency” in sub-
scribing to this policy. It would also be practical, said
Father Starks, to remain silent about the immorality
and blasphemy of certain campus publications.

He compared the possibility of an appearance of a
Communist speaker on a campus of the State University
with that of an officially sanctioned speech on Roman

Catholicism and asked, “is
there room and license for

anti—religion, but nothing but legal
exclusion of religion?”

in regard to speaker autonomy
Father Starks also commented, “i
do, as an American, protest most
vehemently the privilege accorded
to the exponents of atheism, anti—
Americanism, or any “ism” that
is foreign to Americanism."

Calls Student Publications Immoral
Father Starks accused unnamed
student publications ofimmorality,

Senate Keeps
School Colors

()ne of State’s dcarly held tradi-
tions gnincd a scr_»oirrl life this past
wcck. A previously passed motion
to change the school colors from
the traditional purplc and gold to
blue and gold was reconsidered
and then defeated.

A uniquo addition to the siudcnt
mailing system com'crning dorm
rcsidcnfs, was a second highlight
of a somewhat loquncious legisla-
lch rircctiilg’.

Senate Reconsiders

(in Nov. 7, Senate had passcd
by a slim margin, a motion chang—
ing the school colors.

The following \\'edncsday, amo—
tion was made. and passed to re-
considcr the motion, since it was
f'clt that not onough thought had
bccn rlircctcd to thc mailer,

Those in favor of the color
change maintaincd flint since blue
and gold wcrc the colors of the
State l’nivcrsity the charrng would
hpr cstablish Albany as the main
School of thc anfc l’nchrsity sys—
tcm.

licor‘gc l.omaga, ’65, pointcdouf
that, “if othcr schools in thc Stale
syslcm changod thcircolors tobluc
and gold we will lose our iridi—
vidualitv.”

If was felt that our acadcinic
standing and school policics \vcrc.
much more important to school
prestige than colors.

President ("ondolnni stated that
tho administration was surprised
that the colors had become. such an
issur: and that while it favored the
changc it would not force it.

'l‘hc motion was ovcrwhclmingly
defeated.

Student Mail Change

(‘ommunications (‘o in mi t too
(‘hairman, li‘r'ed Smith, announced
that a mailing system would go
into effect Monday Dec. 6.

Under the new system if will be
possible to send messages todorm
residents through a mail box lo—
oatcd at the school,

pornography, and blasphemy. He
did not state what could be con—
sidc red immoral, pornographic, or
blasphemous. l-le objected to the
authors of such articles being al—
lowed to teach in the public schools.

Writers Unfit to Touch in Schools

The clergyman summarized his
criticisms of campus publications
in the last sentence ofhiseditorial
by saying, “To entrust the educa—
tion of the next generation tothose
who confuse academic freedom
with academic licensc. political
expediency with democratic free—
dom, and perverted morals for
freedom of expression is to abro—
gate all law and perpetrate the
decadence of this nation, which
was founded under God, with liberty
and justice for all.”

Local News Coverage

in '1 article with the headline
“Pril-si Calls SUNY Campus Peri—
odicals immoral,” which appeared
in the Tlmos Unlon, November 21,
Mr. “Doc” Rivett discus se d
Father Starks’ editorial inconnec—
tion with supprossion. A similar
article appeared in the Knicker-
bocker News.

The evening paper quoted Dr.
lu‘van Collins, President ofthe col—
lege who stntcd, "Father Starks
was writing to the Roman Catholic
students on the campus, andhehas
a right to say anythinghepleases."

Father Starks appear-Ml on the
6:30 neWs; broadcast over (‘hnnnel
13, November 21. He again stated
his criticisms of student publica—
tions and his objections to the
authors of pornography and bias—

schools.
