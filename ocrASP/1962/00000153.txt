KB Storms to Lead
In AMIA Bowling

by Don Fear

At the end of the fourth week of
bowling KB leads the AMIA Scratch
League with a 23-5 won-lost rec-
ord. The Unknowns, hot on the
heels of the KB team, are in second
place with a 19-9 record.

This week saw the men of KB
trouncing TXO 7-0, the margin of
victory being 428 pins. The red-
hot Unknowns knocked off Potter by
a 7—0 count, thus dropping the
Club from a first-place tie with
KB.

The Goobers squeaked by the
Sophs, winning the first and second
'games by only thirteen pins and
the last game by only one pin.
Waterbury beat the Newman Club
by a margin of 5-2.

Third Week Results

Last week’s results showed KB
and Potter winningby 7—0 margins,
beating the Newman Club and the
Sophs respectively. The Unknowns
knocked off the Goobers 5—2. and
Waterbury beat TXO 4—3.

The Unknowns in beating the
Goobers set a new league record
for high team triple with a rousing
2639. Pacing this fine team effort
was Dave Roeguer with an out—
standing 61? series on games of
219, 214, and 179. Backing up
Roegner were the Thomas broth-
ers, Phil and Bill, with 591 and
583 series.

Last week’s high triples were
hit by Don Fear. 619: Roeg‘ner.
612; B. Thomas, 591: P. Thomas,
583; Al Sabo, 534; and Don Hale
and Tony Riservato, 514.

High singles were hit by Fear,
245; P. Thomas, 223; Roegner and
Riservato, 219: B. Thomas. 215;
Roegner, 214: P. Thomas. 203: and

Gary Moore, Kirk Ellis, and Fear,
200.

This week’s high triples were
hit by Jim Gittleman, 594; Fear,
590; P. Thomas, 583: John Lilga,

539: Jon Barden, 537; Kirk Ellis,
534; B. Thomas, 524: Wayne Van

Pelt, 523: and Tony Riservato,
521.

High singles were hit by P.
Thomas, 222; Fear. 220; Van Pelt
and Tony Riccerdelli, 219; Gittle-
man, 215; Riservato, 202: Roeg-
her, 201: and Ellis, 200.

As can be seen by aquick glance
at the scores there are a number
of fine bowlers in the AMIA league
this year. Each year the competi—
tion gets tougher. The fine bowl—
ing of men like Dave Roegner,Jim
Gittleman, John Lilga, Phil
Thomas, Tony Rise rvato, and many
others has led to a situation where
almost any team in the league is
capable of winning the league
championship. At the present time
the standings are not close, but in
one week they can change drasti~
cally.

For example, last week Potter
was tied for first place, but after
dropping seven points this week
they are now in third place. The
same can happen to KB next week,
or any other team in the league.
This year’s league is well—bal—
anced, to say the least.

experience”, will be taller than last year’s squad. To date, however, the team has

been unable to match last year’s rebounding performance.

Sauers stated that, “the team
has been inconsistent in scrim-
mages -— we’ve either been real
good or real bad, but i expect
the team to jail." It should be
noted that the team has scrim—
maged against a number of larger
and more powerful schools, in—
cluding the University of Massa—
chusetts.

Among the experienced mcn that
Sauers will have to work with,
Senior Jim tippcdisano hcads thc

902 points in his collcgc career

‘suppression’Obtains Official
Recognition from Senate

by Dave Jonlu

Wednesday’s Senate meeting,
which many had thought would
raise a storm of controversial
fire, failed even to sputter, as the
business at hand was taken care of
with little debate.

The main business ofthe evening
got underway when Bonnie Batche—
lor moved that the constitution of
suppression be accepted.

Following a ten minute period
for perusal of the constitution,
President Condajani opened dis—
cussion.

Section 6 Causes Trouble

Each article and section was
covered with little objection until
Article VI, sec. 6, stuck its rather
different looking nose in the way.

This portion of the constitu—
tion states:

The Editorial Board reserves
the right to render null and void,
by three-fourths vote of the Edi-
torial Board, the constitution of
suppression, in the event of inci—
dents whioh might lead to any form
of limitation of its intended pur—
pose, goals, and aims.

Section 6 Deboted

Senator Tony DiRocco ’64, was
the first to voice an objection. He
questioned the reason for this, and
declared that it would make the
constitution of little worth.

“With this power,” stated Sen-
ior Senator Jean'l‘ully, “they could
make their constitution null and
void without anyone knowing it."

Bonnie Batchelorpointcdoutthat
the main thing that was different
about this constitution was that it
stated and defined thingsthatother
organizations accepted without
stating.

“All organizations have the right
to change their constitutionsifthey
feel it is necessary. That is. in
essence, what this says, and they
do have this right,” added Sopho-
more Tony Riservato.

It was statedby several senators
that this section made the con—
stitution weak, and that the situa-
tion would bc no (liffcrcntnow, than
it had been bcforc the constitution
was submittcd.

Submitted To Please SA

In rcply to this Bob Kurosakn,

Math and Scicnce Editor ofsuppres-

sion, commcntcd, “We have

submitted the constitution to please
Senate and to gain recognition so
that we can use the school facili-
ties.”

“If we declare our constitution
null and void, we, as a campus
publication, would destroy our-
selves and become merely an off—
campus paper.”

The question appeared to be
settled when Candy Del Pan ’63,
commented that she was not so
worred about the constitution, but
rather what suppression printed.

She felt that some of it was
“down right trash” and put our
University in a bad light.

“if the material was that bad,"
interjected Senator Riservato,
“the administration would put a
stop to it.”

Sue Murphy ’64, said that they
merely wanted to put forth the
level that they thought suppression
should come up to.

“We have realized our respon-
sibilities as editors of this paper.
We have used good taste and shall
continue to do so,” was Dick
Rogers’ comment.

“If a person has an objection to
what we print, we would like them
to see us personally.”

Joe Lamonica moved the previ-
ous question, and the constitution
was approved by a 33—? vote.

Service Committee

Lenny Lapinski, Services Com-
mittee Chairman, gave a report
on recent projects.

He announced that the name on
the new school banner would be
changed, the study room in Bru
would be set up again, and that
plans have been started by the
Recreation Committee to set up an
ice-skating rink on Dorm Field.

Inauguration Day

Senator Jim Miles, Election
Commissioner, brought up the bus-
iness concerning the date for
Inauguration Day.

The two dates under considera—
tion were. February 23 and March
‘2. Since the latter date would al—
low a longer campaign pcriod and
enable Election Commission to
send ballots to off—campus student
teachers, a motion was made and
passed setting March 2 for the
1963 Inauguration Day.

Voting on 2.0 Amendment
To Commence Monday

by Jim Miles

An amcndmcnt to the. Student
Association Constitution to make
a 2.0 average manditory for S.A.
officers. senators. and class of—
t'iccrs was passcdby the necessary
3/4 votc by Scnatc on (ictobcr 24.
'l‘hc :imcndmcnt now nccds a ‘3/3
plurality with at least 207 of thc
silidcnl body voting.

\'oiing on thc amcndmcnt by the
student body will lakc placc Mon-
day, 'l'ucsday, and \\’edncsday, Dc—
ccmbcr if), 11, and I2, fl‘t)ll’19.'1.rll.
to .‘l p.m. in thc llustcd l.owcr
l’ci‘istylc_ 'I'hcrc will also bc vol.

ing 'l'ucsdav from 7 to 9 p.m. in

tlic gumc room of tho Sludciil
l‘nion.

l-Ilcction Commission rcqucsts
that each studcnl consider thc

urgumcnts on both sidcs bcfoi‘o
voiing...and then mix.

A summation ofthc lll‘tlllll’lléllih‘ in
favor of the 2.0 requirement are:
l) The primary reason for attcnd—
ing collcgc is to obtain an cduca—
tion. ‘3) A 2.0 average is thc min»
iruurn measurementofsalisfaciory
performance set by our college.
Why then should studcnt govorn~
lllt‘lll bc satisfied with less than
llllS minimum?

Also, 3) it has been stated that
a student elected to student gov-
ernment who does not have a 2.0
must either: a) devote his time to
studying and neglect the duties of
his office, or 1)) work eniargctical~
ly its an S.A. officer and neglect
his studies. Either way he is
hurting himself and the school.
4) A leader includes being a stu-
dent in good academic standing.

   

A summation of thc arguments
against the 2.0 requirement are:
1) A student has the righttodecidc
whether he is capable of assuming
the duties of the office. ‘2) The
voters are aware of the student’s
ave rage beforc voting for or
against him.

Also, 3) There is no proof that
not being on Senate is any motiva—
tion to a student's studying. >1)
Studcnts below a ’2.t) arc dcnicd
tho right to prove thcmsclvos
capable lcaders. 5) A ‘2.t)avcragc
is not rcquircd to rcmain in col—
lcgc, but to graduate from this
institution.

(.‘onsidcr carcfully all thc argu-
mcnts and gotg intclligcnlly on tho
amendmcnt to thc constitution of
the Student Association.
