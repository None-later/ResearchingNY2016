Are We Proud of This ?

Hidden in one of the darker corners of this university
is a cafeteria. We realize that we are using the word
“cafeteria” very loosely, but we do believe itis some-
what accurate.

The condition of the cafeteria is one of the most
amazing things in this institution.

The floors are almost always filthy; the food is far
from exceptional; the coffee is far from average; and
the crowding is close to complete.

In addition, it is very doubtful that any major effort
has been made to exterminate the rodents whichinhabit
the Husted Cafeteria walls. These are not white mice.

The cafeteria is very rarely kept open for the full
number of hours stipulated in the contract which, in
theory, controls its operation.

There are no napkin dispensers in two of the four
non—faculty rooms. Two of the three dispensers in the
“well equipped” are empty by 1:00.

In two of the rooms, the tables are placed too close
together. In the other two, there are round tables
and desks. Both of the latter types are very inefficient.
The most wasted space is in the “Cave” because of
the round tables and the individual accomodations.

Another big problem is the absence of a ventilating
system. Certainly somethingcouldbe done. We suggest
that a hammer be purchased. This is the ideal tool
for the job. It can be used to open all the windows
about a half-inch; if the windows have grown permanently
closed since the last ventilation period (back in the
early 1930’s), it can be used to break each window in
either a left corner or a right corner according to the
political leanings of the maintenance engineer who
performs the tasks.

There are also complaints about the menu. One never
knows what kind of jelly will accompany his peanut—
butter. One never knows whether or nothe will be able
to see his egg salad or histuna salad hidden beneath the
generous serving of lettuce.

All in all, we suggest that such News advertisers as
The Mayflower, the College Sub House, the Union, and
occasionally \Valt’s be patronized. In addition there are
many other places around Albany such as the Boule—
vard, the Waldorf, the College Restaurant, Joe’s, Vin—
nie’s, Mike’s, the Quail Street Restaurant, and Wool—
worth’s. The ideal time to try all these places,
especially the subscribers, is this coming Monday.

Let’s Have a Fire

There is no fire evacuation plan in this college.
There is no excuse for this situation as it stands today.
There is no excuse for the situation to continue after
this coming Monday.

We had a nice little fire earlier this week. It showed
that none of the staircases have adequate smoke control.
it showed that there is no way to stop a fire which in—
tends to travel through the lower level of the college.

Except for the fact that this college is owned by the
State, there is every reason to believe that the Albany
city fathers would be annoyed with our situation, if
their fire laws are as strict as we hope they are.

There should be plans for fire evacuation from the
main college buildings and every annex. This should
have been made years ago.

Play Big Roles
In Billy Budd

by Paul Jensen

The question of how the film
Billy Budd compares to Herman
Melville’s novel is one that ought
to be ignored. A motion picture,
no matter what its original source,
is an entity unto itself and so must
stand or fall on its own merits.

With this in mind, and taken
solely on its own quality (or lack
of it), the film Billy Budd stands
very high indeed. in all depart—
ments — acting, directing, writing
— the picture is consistently su—
perior.

Characters, Not Types

It is, though, less of a pure
allegory than i had been led to
believe. InsteadofportrayingBilly
and the Master at Arms Claggart
as, respectively, completely good
and evil, actors Terence Stamp
and Robert Ryan have presented
them as human beings in whom a
particular quality is dominant.

Thus Billy, although innocently
believing in everyone’sbasic good-
ness and intuitively having a great
insight into people’s motives, is
not as completely naive as he
could have been. He is a human
being who can enjoy joking and
fighting, instead of a complete
Pollyanna. It is this difference
that makes Billy a person rather
than an abstract idea.

The same thing is true of (‘lag—
gart who, although undeniably sa-
distic and evil, is glimpsed,rluring
the scene with liillyonthequarter-
deck, as a man tormented and
driven by some force or incident
from his past.

Plot Contains Element of Tragedy

lecnts almost tend to assume the
inevitability of tragedy, as llillv
unintentionally kills the crew's
tormentor. .-\ Court—martial fol—
lows, and it is decided to free
Billy. The captain of the ship
(l’ctcr l'stinov), however, decides,
and managcs to convince thc othcr
officers, that thc boy must hang;
the lcticr of the law must bc
Scrvwl, raihcr than justice.

A Key Scene Unconvincing

It is this sccnc that strikcs onc
of thc I‘cw Ialsc, notcs in thc pic—
ture. ('aptain \‘crc‘s argumcnts
sccm, from thc audicncc’s poiniof
vicw, to bc singularly uncom'inc—
ing. This might be dcfcndcd by
stating that it was intcntional, and
that thc officcrs \vcrc supposcd to
bc “tnkcn in" this way.

Ilowcvi-r, that would provc :iwk—
wnrd, as ihc IlIlllllllll' conclusion

Some Merit, Nevertheless

Iiut despiic this occasional pat

National Fraternity Group
Examines Current Problems

by Dave Jenks

“It is too bad that every fra-
ternity member at Albany State
could not have attended this con—
ference."

These were the sentiments of
Bill Leo '64 and Doug Flatt ’64,
who had just returned from the
National lnterfraternity Confer—
ence in Pittsburgh. A discussion
of cooperative buying, an excellent
talk on the “Changing Functions of
Fraternities" and several smaller
discussions highlighted a very en—
lightening aan somewhat inspiring
weekend for Albany's represcnta-
lives.

The three—day conference
opener] with a panel discussion on
fraternity cooperative buying. {In—
der this plan all the fraternities
on a campus band together in a
sort of “economic alliance.”

Food is bought in quantity for
all the fraternities togcthcr, thus
cuttingcosts.

Once a director is hired, pro—
fessional hpr oblained, and the
program started, many advantages
prcscni themsel' is:

(1) Actual savings range any—
whcrc from 101' to 302’ depending
on the specific item.

(’2) Thcrc is the convenience of
only onc monthlychcckpaymcnt for
cach fraternity.

(3) The quality of thc food is
assured and controllcd, thus mcan-
ing better meals.

H) The co—op can give loans to
l'rntcrnitics.

The main disadvantage, how—
cycr is the difficulty in changing
from thc old buying pattern.

Dr. Warner Speaks

llr. .l. ('. ‘\'nrncr, one of thc
rnnin spcakcrs and President of
the (":irncgic lnstiiutc of 'l‘cch—
nol(‘>gy, siaicd what worried him
most about fraternities:

(l) “l"rntcrnitics seem to pros—
pcr lcast on lhosc campuscwvhich
bavc tlic most distinction as con—
lcrs for high academic standards.

(2) “Too many of thc bcst stu—
dcnts arc not intcrcslcd in bcing
fratcrniiv mcmbcrs or fraternity
lcndcrs.

(3) “()n a substantial numbcr of
cnmpuscs ihc pcrt‘cniagc of sin—
dcnts intcrcsl in fratcrnitics is
declining.

PHONOG

(4) “The fraternity system is
being condemned, or at least
frowned upon, by most human
rights commissions and by a num-
ber of college presidents.

“However,” he added, “if guid-
ance and encouragement are given
to fraternities and sororities, and
if they are willing to adjust to
the modern academic world, they
still have a useful, substantial role
to play on the majority of cam-
puses.”

Dr. Tratsel Best Speaker

In the opinion of Albany’s twr)
delegates, the best speech of the
entire conference was givcn by
Dr. ’l‘rotscl.

He maintained that it was thr-
function of the fraternity to “ele-
vate the campus culture.” Ilow
wcll it does this is a test of its
worth.

In his talk be projected the
fraternity to 1977. Fratcrnity
houses lhcn will each haVc their
own study rooms, recreational
areas, lislcning rooms, and li—
brarics.

At this future date fraternities
will bc on collcgc aml university
curriculum and program commit—
ices.

“Also,” l)r. 'I‘rotscl maintains,
“the spiritual impact of frater—
nities will bc felt on the college
campuses. I~‘ratcrnitics must lcad
and translntc idcnlisms of thcir
rituals and standards to thc col-
lcgc community.

“If thcrc arc no paccseltcrs,”
hc concludcd, “lhcrc will bc no
idcas. We fraicrnitics can and
must bc thcsc pal-csciicrs, or thc
fratcrnity will not cxisi,"

Summary

“It is easy to see that a problcm
exists," our dc l c go ic s agrccd,
“and wc must soch it."

“Thc rolc of fraternities is
changing, Thcv are no longcr dc—
pcndcd upon for just a social out—
lcl and for housing — now they
must also bc intellectual.

In ordcr lo rctain its uscfulncss,
thi- fratcrniiv must kccp :ihcndof
thc ever—changing collcgc campus.

Communications

To the Editor:

Electives are acommonproblem
to us college students. Each se—
mester we ponder over which ones
not only would we be interestedin,
but will also fit into our partially
filled schedules.

As a result of this dilemma
several semesters ago. [happened
to come across two courses which
I had never hea rd mentioned around
school, and which, I am reason-
ably certain, most State students
do not know exist.

These two courses are HE 121A

and HE 1218, driver education
courses. Contrary to the beliefs

of those of you who may have
noticed them while thumbing
through the college catalog, these
courses are not for the beginning
driver.

Rather, the prerequisite for
HE 121A is a New York State
Operator’s License with at least
one year's safe driving experi-
ence.

The courses are designed to pre—
pare the student to teach driver
education in New York State high
schools or in adult education pro-
grams.

Materials and Methods in Driver
Education, HF) 121A, aims to im-
prove the habits and skills of the
student and give him an idea of
how to develop these in beginning
drivers, besides covering the ma-
terials available for drivereduca-
tion programs and the methods of
teaching both in the classroom and
in the car.

Ill? 1218 is the student teaching
phase of the sequence. In this
course. the student is given the
responsibility of teaching, under
supervision, three fellow college
students to drive.

Let me emphasize one point, the
highly practical value of this se-
quence. With just these two elec—
tlvcs, each carrying two credit
hours, and graduation with certi—
fication to teach in whatever field
you may have chosen, you will be
qualified to teach driver education.

Not only could this influence a
prospective employer, since you
would have one more teachingfield
than most other applicants, but it
can be the means of extra income
by teaching driver education in
evening adult education or summer
school programs.

And if you think back to your
own high school days, this is one
class teenagers do not trytoavoid,
you will remember. The eagerness
of these pupils can be a welcome
change from history, physics, or
math.

As for disadvantages, l knoon
non, unless perhaps you don’thave
confidence in your own reflexes —
your brnkc foot and left hand can
always assume control of the car
if necessary.

liy the way, girls, as one ofyou,
I'd likc to cmphasize that driver
education is not an exclusive of
our male friends.

There are now women teaching
thc course in New York State.
schools, and perhaps if we work
iogcthcr on it, We may have the
gench implication of “women
drivcrs" replaced by rcspcci for
us.

If you pass the safe driving cx—
pcricncc rpialification, why not
visit our rcccntly added faculty

structor, \li'. Kennth Long, in

To the Editor:

to give recognition to Mr. Munsey,
who has been coach for the last
