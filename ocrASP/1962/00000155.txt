Unknowns Hold Game Lead
In AM IA Bowling League Race

Last week we mentioned the
possibility of KB being upset just
as Potter had been the previous
week. This weekthat“passibillty”
became a reality, as the up and
coming Goobers trounced the KB
men 5-2.

Leading the Goobers to victory
was Mert Sutherland who bowled
an outstanding 586 series. Mert
pounded the maples for games of
191, 214, and 181. Whenever the
team needed the big strike Mert
was there. Also a big factor in
the Goober victory was the steady
bowling of Jim Gittleman. Jim
pounded out a 512 series.

In another match the amazing
Unknowns continued on their ways

 

by beating Newman Club 7—0.
Leading the Unknowns to victory
was the equally amazing Phil
Thomas.

Phil bowled a fine 582 series on
games of 158, 212, and 212. Phil
has been on a hot streak of late.
In the last three weeks he has hit
series of 583, 583. and582. That’s
an average of 1941

Last year Thomas averaged be-
tween 155 and 160. But this year
his average has shot up to 180 plusl

In the other matches Potter
knocked off Waterbury 4-3 as Gary
Penfield bowled an outstanding 233
in his first game. The Sophs beat
TXO 5-2.

Gary Penfield led all bowlers in

   

the single department with his 233.
In that game Penfield had his first
five in a row. and later in the
game he had a double. Other high
singles were hit by Sutherland 214.
Thomas’s pair of212’s, Wayne Van
Pelt, 199, and Gittleman. 194.

Mert Sutherland led all bowlers
in the triple department with his
fine 586 series. Close to Mert
was Thomas with his 582. followed
by Van Pelt, 546, Penfield, 532.
Don Hale, 518, Don Fear, 515, and
Gittleman, 512.

As far as the teams are con—
cerned the Unknowns are sitting
in first place. one game ahead of
KB. The Unknowns look like the
best team in the league.

Another exciting gainer by Alex Webster, good
Well, not quite.

The above mis—

adventure is merely atypical scene in any AMIA basket-

ball game.

The current intramural hoop season began

last weekend, but as one battered player has remarked,
“It’s just a continuation of AMIA football.”

Watching an AMIA basketball game almost beats
watching the Giants crush their opponents into the soft
turf of Yankee Stadium. If you enjoy blood, bruises and

groans, then AMIA basketball is for you.
then AMIA’s version of Mr.

basketball,

If you like
Naismith’s

invention is definitely not for you.

AMIA basketball has already degenerated (ifit’s pos-
sible to degenerate in the space of two days) into what
amounts to a free-for—all, with a basketball thrown
in for good measure. The players battle each other with
gusto, paying little attention to the rules of this “non—
contact” sport. Elbows and hands are usedwith abandon,
and Page Hall hardwood is definitely notYankee Stadium

turf.

The fault must be placed with the officiating, of

course.

But, what officiating? Hardly a peep is heard

out of those nice shiny whistles the referees carry, and
the unwritten code appears to be “Get the Game Over

As Fast As Possible.”

Now the basketball season has just begun.

If this

carnage continues till the end, there can be only one

result. Somebody’s going to get hurt bad!
Steps must be taken by AMIA to improve the

wants.

This no one

officiating. This AMIA owes to itself.

AMIA BoskelballBegins
With 4 Leagues Playing

Last Saturday witnessed the
opening of an expanded AMIA lins-
ketball season. Four leagues will
compete this year instead of the
customary three in the past.

The new league is the result of
the division of the old secoan
league into the new stronger second
and third leagues, and the dropping
of the old third league into the new
fourth league category.

This action was taken by the
AMIA commissioners Jerry Blair
and Dick Kimball to achieve an
overall greater balance in the
league.

Cagers Trounce Pace
Play at BuffaloTonite

by Gary Smith

The varsity basketball team started the season offon the right foot last Saturday
as they traveled to Pace College and emerged with a 67—44 victory. Combining
both offense and a fine defense, the Peds pulled away in the second half after

being ahead 31-29 at halftime.

For the first eleven minutes of the second half the team’s defense held Pace
scoreless in a demonstration of excellent defensive ability. Although the offense

Grunt & Groaners Shape Up

For Big Opener Tomorrow
Home with Brooklyn Poly

by Dick Pavlis

The 1962—63 wrestling season gets into full swing
tomorrow afternoon with a match at home, in Page Gym
at 2:00 p.m., against Brooklyn Poly. This is a season
which can be looked forward to with mixed hopes.

Graduation Hurts Team

Albany will certainly feel the lose of four solid point
producers: Ray Bouchard, Clem Crowe, Jay Katzel,
and Tom Ellis, who togethercombined for animpressive
27—9—1 record last year. Especially hard to replace will
be the one—two punch of Crowe (301 N.Y.S.I.A.C. and
4—1 champion) and Bouchard (115 1b. N.Y.S.I.A.C.
champion).

However, the plus side is also bright for Albany.
Coach Garcia is high on a pair of sophs — Lee Comeau
and (lene Monaco — though both are probably another
year away from full potential, even though they have
won starting positions.

The heaviest part of the load, then, must be carried
by Co—(‘aptnins John \\=’oytowich (8—2 last year) and
Dick Board (ineligible) and senior Art Brunelle (6-4).
The former are “two of the toughest boys ever to wear
State togs”, while Coach Garcia feels Brunelle could
be the best wrestler on the squad.

Also showing promise is Les Keys who should be
ready to start around the second semester; second
semester help should also be coming from Howard
Blum, who will not wrestle until then.

Rebuilding Needed

(‘oach (:nrcia will have some rebuilding to do this
year, but building wrestlers is old stuff for Albany’s
wrestling mentor, as witnessed by the factthatonly one
(Crown) of last years “big four” hadprevious wrestling
experience before coming to State.

The other spots on the team will be contested for by
returning members of last year’s squad and sopho—
mores. 'I‘hcsc showing the quickest improvement will
be the «*nI‘Iy season starters.

Lack of Depth

The team’s biggcst problem according to Coach
(inrciu will be {111 old problem-lackofdcpth. Last year,
for example, the team was forced to forfeit weights in
three matches; these forfeitures cost the team victor—
ies, us the team lost these matches by two, three, and
six points.

This your the team will be able to make all the
weights in the dual meets, but in the conference it will
not flux Ill)1t’ to do so, The mntmcn will definitely have
to foririt the 115 lb. class and will probably have to
forfeit the 191 lb. t-Iuss also.

l"or the opening match tomorrow the following men
will probubly start: 1‘23 1b. (lone Monaco (Sopli), 130
1b. Im‘ (‘omcau (Soph), 137 lb. Ronald Kent (Jr.),
H7 11), Arthur Hruncllc (Sn), 15711), John \\'oytowich

(Sr), 107 1b, John Benith or Richard Ix’alfns (.lrs.),
177 lb. Richard Board (.112). and Richard Robeletto
(Soph).

(in the Ifrosh wrestling front, (,‘oach Burlingame has
had a dozon men come out for the team, half of whom
hch experience. The fresh matmcn will open their
oven malt-h schedule next Tuesday at home wrth RPI.

Probable starters in no week’s opener are 12311.).
H111 ’l‘homas, 130 11). Ray barter, 137 lb. Bob \r’ergim,
147 lb. John Miller, 157 1b. John Robb, 1671b. Larry
’l‘homas, 177 lb. Bob (lreene or Les Negus, and Hvy.
Mike Binder or (Iary '/.oIIinger.

sputtered at times it
still had enough to surge
to the front and never

relinquish the lead. Sophomore
Dick Crossett, playing in his first
varsity game for Albany, made his
debut an auspicious one as he
paced the team with 15 points.
Senior Co—Captain JimOppedisano
was close behind with 14 while
Ray Weeks added 11. On the op~
posite side of the ledger Ron
Focazio had the game high with
17 points.

The team, which looked a little
rusty at times, will have a chance
to jell this week as they traveled
to Utica on Tuesday. Tonight the
team meets a tough Univ. of Buf—
talc and tomorrow night encounters
Buffalo State.

The Univ. ofBuffalo game should
prove a testing ground for Ped
fortunes this year. They are one of
the biggest schools thatAlbany has
ever faced and are a western New
York basketball power. Should
the squad win this one they could
very easily improve on lastyear’s
19—6 record.

Last year the Purple and Gold
defeated Buffalo State in the Ar-
mory quite handily and the team
will be looking for its' second
straight over the Orange and
Black.

The first home game for the
hoopsters is Friday, December 14
against Potsdam State. The fol—
lowing evening the team will take
on an always tough Cortland State
five. Last year the Peds beat
Potsdam away but lost to Cortland
in a squeaker.
