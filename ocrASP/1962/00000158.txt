Spinning the
Sports Wheel

Al Sherman Goes Athletic

So you got problems. Who don’t have problems?
You know that basketball coach, Dr. Sauers? What kind
of problems he’s got! He’s got a varsity basketball
team—that’s plenty of problems. He’s got a good
basketball team; sometimes that’s even more problems.

You know his team starts off real good. They win
their first two games with no trouble. Everything’s
fine. It’s like Chanukah and Purim rolledinto one. But
then what happens shouldn’t happen to a Syrian. Last
weekend the team takes the bus to Buffalo to play two
games...

What you say? What’s Buffalo? Oh, that’s a place
near the overflow for Lake Erie where all the honey—
mooners go. You wouldn’t like it there. Too cold. It’s
not like Miami. All it’s got is snow, Canadians, and
lots of electricity. Electricity is nice, but snowI
could live without. Canadians I don’t know, but if they
make Canadian Club, I guess that’s kosher.

Well anyhow, getting back to my story. This Buffalo
place also has got basketball teams. They play basket-
ball pretty good. What else they got to do with all
the snow? They got one school there, the University of
Buffalo, supposed to have fine basketball team. It
doesn’t lose any games so far this year.

Well, last Friday our basketball team plays these
buffalos, and for a while they do good. But then things
don’t go so good. The buffalos start to catch up. And
before you know it, we lose the game 56—54. Poor Dr.
Sauers, for this he goes all the way to Buffalo?

Oh boy, but the worst is yet to come. The team
plays the State University College at Buffalo the next
night. Maybe the players feel let down after losing the
night before? They got no fans up there. They’re
feeling depressed. Who wouldn’t be depressed after
spending two days in Buffalo? So they lose this game
too, 47—46.

Oh boy! Dr. Sauers could use adoctor. What a case
of ulcers he must have by now. To lose two games by
three points is not for me. It’s not for basketball
coaches either.

But you think his troubles are over? After all, the
team has played its first four games away from home.
Tonight and tomorrow they play in the Washington
Armory. Lots of fans turn out to cheer them on. You
think everything be fine now?

Hahl You don’t think. The schedule makers in this
college are as spastic as ever. Tomorrow is only
the big game with Cortland. So what’s tomorrow? Only
Winterlude and the SUO dance. How many people do you
think will show up now? A fewless than a few would be
about right. Who knows, maybe a few people from Buf—
falo will get sick of the town, and come down and see
our Peds play.

Varsity Grapplers Debut State to Face Potsdam & Cortland
As Sauersmen Stand 2 - 2 on Year

With Easy 27-3 Victory
Over Brooklin Poly Sat.

by Dick Pavlis

Albany State’s varsity matmen got their season Off
to a good start last Saturday as they trounced visiting
Brooklyn Poly by a convincing 27—3 score. The Fed’s
took four matches by decision, one on a pin, and two
by forfeit.

In the meet’s first two matches — the 123 and 130
pound classes — State’s promising sophomores Gene
Monaco and Lee Comeau showed why Coach Garcia is
high on them as they got the Fed’s off to a quick lead
by decisioning their opponents. Monaco won his match
6—0 and Comeau took his 3—0.

After Brooklyn Poly forfeited the 137 pound class,
giving State an 11—0 team lead over their rivals, Art
Brunello upped the team lead to 14—0 with a decision
over his opponent 4—0.

The next class — 157 pound — featured the best match
of the whole meet, for State fans anyway. In this con—
test the Fed’s John \Voytowich ‘iiok part in the quickest
contest of the day as he pinned his opponent in the first
period, after dominating what little action took place in
the brief match.

State upped the score to 24—0 as the visitors for—
feited the 167 pound class. State picked up its final
victory in the 177 pound class as (EO-(Yililtnill Dick
Board won a decision 7—3, breakingtho shutout skeln for
the individual matches.

In the final match of the day Brooklyn I’oly salvaged
something from their Visit by taking a 3:0 decision in
the Heavyweight class. State’s Dick liobolcttowrestled
well, but was hampered by a lack of experience — this
being the sophomore’s first varsity malt-h.

Though the matmen won handily ovo r Brooklyn I’oly,
the score can be misleading. State, though wrestling
rather well for this early in the season, was helped by
two forfeits and a general lack of good opposition on
the part of their adversaries.

Coach Garcia will get a better idea of his team’s
potential soon, however. Wednesday the team wrestled
tough Oneonta Slate and tomorrow will go against
another tough team — Fairleigh I)i("kinson. The latter
meet will be held at home in Page (lym at 2:00 pm.

The freshman wrestling team also has a question
mark about it. However, it is not a question of how
good the team is, but rather is there a team“? t‘oach
Burlingame’s frosh are being hampered by a lilt'k of
personnel, and the way it looks now the team will really
have a tough time winning matches as they will lit‘ laced
by the problem of forfeiting many of their \\'i'ighis‘.

the current campaign tonight and
tomorrow in the Washington Ave—
nue Armory. Both games are

night our supposrdly “weak” state
school proved not so “weak” as
the Univ. of iiiiffalo puffed to a
58—56 victory.

The Pods proved that they were
not to be taken lightly when they ran
off to an early 18—9 lead. The
height of the UR. squad began to
tell and at halftime the tally was

knotted at 26—all. After intermis-
sion the Feds returned and played
on better than ever terms for the
next 10 minutes and found them-
selves in front 39—36.

Buffalo Pulls Ahead

The Buffalo squad, which had
more depth. overtook the visitors
with less than 5 minutes left in
the game. Manno and Handley, who
both played well for Buffalo, sealed
the I’eds doom with 6 straight
points which offset last ditch bas-
kets by Ray Weeks and DickCros-
sett.

Belarious and Handley led Buf—
falo with 14 and 10 points respec—
tively. Crossctt with 21 points and
15 rebounds paced the Purple and
(told while (to—captain JimOppedi—
sano added 12. Buffalo had a 23-
12 breakdown for their points while
the Paris were 24—8 for their 56
markers.

The team played well in absorb—
ing their first defeat of the season
after two straight victories. How—
ever, they Iackcd depth and gen-
erally lacked a bigman to counter-
act the overall Univ. of Buffalo
height.

PAGE 5

On Saturday night the team took
to the hardwoods against Buffalo
State, their first conference op-
ponent of the year. If there had
been frustration the night before,
this game was even more frustra-
ting as the Albanians bowed 47-46.

To make it worse, the winning
basket was scored by Dick Emer of
Buffalo State on a 20 foot jump
shot with only 5 seconds left in
the ball game. As during the
night before. the Feds lead
throughout most of the ball game.

Albany was ahead 15-13 with 10
minutes gone in the game and was
in front at intermission by a27—24
count. The defensive battle,which
has characterized many of the
Albany games so far this year,
continued as the Peds were in front
38—34 with 10 minutes to go in the
game.

To demonstrate the strong de-
fensive play of both schools, A1-
bany got only 4 points in the last
5 minutes while the PedsheldBuf—
falo State to a paltry 7 points in
the last 7 minutes of the game.

For Albany, Crossett. who has
been playing excellent ball, again
lead the team with 14 points.
