DECK THE HALLS

When you think of Christmas gifts you naturally think of
Marlboro cigarettes, leading seller in ﬂip—top box in all ﬁfty
states—and if we annex Wales, in all ﬁftybne—and if we an-
nex Lapland—in all ﬁfty-two. This talk about annexing Wales
and Lapland is, incidentally, not just idle speculation. Great
Britain wants to trade Wales to the United States for a desert.
Great Britain needs a desert desperately on account of the
tourist trade. Tourists are always coming up to the Prime
Minister or the Lord Privy Seal or like that and saying, “I’m
not knocking your country, mind you. It's very quaint and
picturesque, etc. what with Buckingham Palace and Bovril
and Scotland Yard, etc., but where’s your desert?” (Before I
forget, let me point out that Scotland Yard, Britain's plain-
clothes police branch, was named after Wally Scotland and
Fred Yard who invented plain clothes. The American plain-
clothes force is called the FBI after Frank B. Inchclih', who
invented ﬁngerprints. Before Mr. Inchclit‘f’s invention, every-
body’s ﬁngers were absolutely glassy smooth. This, as you
may imagine, played hob with the identiﬁcation of newborn
babies in hospitals. From 1791 until 1904 no American parent

 

ever brought home the right baby from the hospital. This
later became known as the Black Tom Explosion.)

But I digress. England, I was saying, wants to trade Wales
fora desert. Sweden wants to trade Lapland for Frank B. Inch-
cliii. The reason is that Swedes to this day still don’t have
fingerprints. As a result, identification of babies in Swedish
hospitals is so haphazard that Swedes flatly refuse to bring their
babies home. There are, at present, nearly a half-billion un-
claimed babies 11] Swedish hospitals~~some of them well over
eighty years old.

Iiut I digress. We were speaking of ('liristuias gifts which
naturally put us in mind of Marlboro cigarettes. What could
be more welcome at (‘hristmiis time than Marlboro's ﬂavor,
Miirlboro's soft pack, Marlboro's flip-top box? What indeed
would be more welcome at any time of yOltl‘lelltf‘t‘ or sum-
mer, rain or shine, night or day‘.’ Any time, any season, when
you light a Marlboro you can always be certain that you will
get the same iiiihl, flavorful, completely comfortable smoke.

'l‘licrc arc, of course, other things you can give for ('liristuiiis
besides Marlboro cigarettes. If, for example, you are looking
for something to give a music lover, let me call to your atten-
tion a rrwolutiouiiry new development in phonographs the
l.o\\'—li phonograph. 'l‘lic lAiw-li, product of years of patient
research, has N) little fidelity to the record you put. on it that if,
for instance, you put "Stardust" ou the turntable, "Melancholy
liaby" will (‘Ullil‘ out, This is 1111 especially welcome gift for
people who have grown tired of "Stardust".

Merry ('hristnias to :ill and to all a good night.

Regents Urge Tuition, Ask More Funds

The question of tuition at this and other units of the
State University was again raised in Governor Rocke-
feller’s inaugural Address and in the legislative pro—
posals of the Regents.

In his Second inaugural Address Rockefeller said that
the state should move strongly to insure the “Improve—
ment and extension of the opportunities for higher edu—
cation for all.” lie did not state whether this means
more tuition or less.

Regents Quoted

in the animal legislative report of the Regents. they
stated: “With respect to the State. Universtiy. the Regents
recommended: ...immediate action by the Trustees to
clarify the tuition and fee. policy of State University
institutions. As is widely known tuition charges vary
widely within the State. University among units offering
comparable programs. The situation is clearly indefen-
sible.

“The 'l‘rustees should not delay longer in the promul-
gation of a uniform foe policy consistent with the State‘s
determination to see to it that no young person of ability
is denied, because of economic difficulties... an oppor—
tunity for a full and rich program ofhigher education..."

The last change in the law controllingtuitionwithin the

 

by Joseph Golu
units of the State University removed control from the
State Legislature. The power was given to the Board of
Trustees of the State University.
Unclear Phrase

The inclusion of the phrase “among units offering
comparable programs” serves to cloud the issue. There
is, at present, no tuition charge for teacher prepara—
tion programs except at the University of Buffalo. The
University of Buffalo was acquiredby the State University
last year. After its acquisition thetuition rate there was
cut to one third of what it had been.

Revision of Scholarships

The proposals with regard to Regents Scholarships are
to enlarge the number of scholarships and to increase
the maximum award. The maximum award would be
increased from $700 to $1200. The minimum would be
reduced to $150.

The Regents favor removing the numerical limiton the
scholarships. The limit is now 17,000. The Regents
favor re—cstablishing the old policy of giving scholar—
ships to 10",’ of the number of graduating high school
This would be a small immediate increase.
the 17,000 figure was an

seniors.
Al the time of its adoption
increase.

State College News

The lowering of the minimum award would not be
retroactive. The estimated cost of these changes for
the first year is 10.3 millions. The proposed increase
for the maximum grant is based on new cost estimates
for private colleges and universities.

Graduate Grants

The Regents proposer! programs designed to help
teachers remain up-to-date in their fields. Last year
555506.000 was spent for this program. There will be a
request for $660,000 this year.

The Regents also proposed three changes in theirpro—
gram to assist in the training of college instructors.
The maximum fellowship is tobeincreasedfrom $2500 to
$3000 per year and the grants are to last three years
instead of the present two your maximum.

At present all Regents fellowship and scholarship
money must be spent for colleges in New York State.
The Regents proposed that this restriction be dropped
with respect to programs designed to aid graduate
students.

These changes require changes in the State’s Educa-
tion Law and additional appropriations. The total ad—
ditional cost of all programs mentioned herein will be
approximately $10,339,000 for this coming year.
