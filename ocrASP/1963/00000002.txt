STATE COLLEGE IIEWS, FRIDAY, JANUARY 11, 1963

 

Muddling Through

After being dropped into a maelstrom of
printing, paste-ups, budgets, and ma—
chines, it would take considerable bravado
to bob up again, clutching four under—
weight issues and gleefully assert, “We
came through o.k., we’ll go on to bigger
and better things!” Such journalistic
garble is quite unjustified, even in a
“good-bye” editorial, and so this must
be a qualified panegyric.

The News is still a “house organ” as a
member of administration tactfully, but
condescendingly, put it. We have not
succeeded in extending news coverage
and commentary beyond the limits of our
campus, including critical appraisals of
books, plays, and speakers, and encour—
aging faculty participation.

We can console ourselves with the real-
ization that it is difficult to promote such
expansion in aperiod ofunexpectcdtransi—
tion and reorganization. Faced with the
problem of putting out the News, we have
not improved what is in the News.

Goodbye Dear Dorms

Anyone fortunate enough to have a final examination
on Wednesday, January 30, will have the dubious honor
of spending a good deal of Thursday traveling home.
Friday and Saturday will be glorious days of rest. On
Sunday you will be allowed to return so that you may
register on time Monday.

Of course, the fact that you may have to spend thirty
or forty dollars to get home and back is not important.
Just think, you can help subsidize the railroads and
buses. Again, of course, if you live north of Albany,
you might not have any public transportation available
unless you have your last exam on the day before a
weekend, but this is of little import.

It is fortunate that the administration of this college
is able to forsee the inevitable and then make its plans
accordingly. Our administration, by its plans for clos—
ing the dorms for a so—called inter—session is able to
prevent the world’s longest and largest drunk. This,
it seems, would be inevitable if the students were al—
lowed to stay in the dorms.

Of course, (for the third time) with the low moral
standards of our student body no one could expect the
students to spend their time reading in the library,
getting their books from the Husted Book Den (oc—
casionally Commons), or going down town to watch the
inaction of the State Legislature.

This policy also forces the student body to maintain
the tradition of having few students at the athletic
events. There will be two home basketball games dur—
ing the closed period. These will have to be attended by
our Milne and Albany l-ligh friends.

We suggest that this enlightened policy be pursued
to its conclusion. Next semester it is suggested that
the dormitories be closcd on all weekends. So what if
the American Bartenders’ Union complains. This isan
institution of higher learning and at no time should
we allow the students to deviate from the goals of our
college.

time as the “('lctober Revolution”
of 1956, has blossomed forth into
a large scalcciiltural renaissance.
Polish theatre is one of the most
active in the world. in the field
of cinema, Polish movie makers,

Fear is Basic Element

in any attempt to control man,
the basic element of structure is
fear. Those who resist and strive
for freedom will be punished. When
all resistance has been destroyed,
falso culprits will be created.
The instilling of fear is not only a
necessity; it is indispensible.
“()ur power, my son, is based on
universal fear.”

Betrayal, even in the high ranks,
is common. Friends do not exist.
Humanity and brotherhood have
been forgotten. “Love is-weakness

I serve the truth and the only
truth and from that l derive my
strength."

Young Diego, .‘1 rebel against the
ideas of I“athc r 'l‘orquemada,

bodiment" of 'l‘orqueniada’s will.

ideas and serve only the “Truth.”

finally betrays his friend, Mateo,

scivnr-o. \Inti-o’s only clliii: is to
be true to himself, and inasocicty
where the major goal is the re—
duction of men to simplctons, he is

Another force against the Iii-
quisition is found in Don Miguel

from the rest of society and iso—

Should the Republicans
Support Segregationists?

by Joseph GaIu

Recently New York State’s two
Republican Se n a to r s have been
criticizing their own party’s sup—
port of segragationist candidates
in the South.

These men are Jacob K. Javits
from Manhattan and Kenneth B.
Keating from Rochester.

They were referring to virtually
every Republican candidate who
ran in last month’s elections in
Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mis—
sissippi, Alabama, Florida, (lear—
gia, 'l'cnnessee, South Carolina.
North (.‘arolina, Virginia, Kentucky
and Maryland.

Timing Questioned

It seems st range that Javits
Waited until after the election to
issue his statement. Keating has
no excuse for not making his be—
fore the election since he was not
running for reelection.

Also during the campaign,hedid
not seem to mindbeingonthe same
ticket as a few upstate New York
segregationists. He did seem to
mind sharing the ticket with \\'il—
son ('. \'an I)tlZZt‘l‘.

Assemblyman \'an Drizzer (sec—
ond as se mb l y district, Orange
('ounty) has made many speeches
against “foreign language groups"
in A m t‘ r i r- a, “minorities” and
othcr phi'asr-s to refer to groups hr!
docs not like.

\':in Homer is ihc most striking
example of a liixiecral in New
York‘s Republican party.

Financing Segregotlonists

Javits declared that the National
Committee of the Republican Party
should not give financial support
to candidates with segregationist
views.

The national chairman, a New
Yorker, has completely dismissed
the remarks of the state’s sena—
tors.

It not only seems that the na-
tional level of their party can do
without Javits and Keating, but
also that the state level ignores
them.

New York First, South Later

it would seem very fitting if
Javits and Keating would concen—
trate their effort on reforming
their party in New York rather
than trying to prevent a change in
party label in the South.

The change in the South would
mean next to nothing.

If .Iavits and Keating were to
popularize their views within the
Republican party in New York, we
would have more worthwhile con—
gressmen from their party.

It would be nice to see a few
more Republicans like John V.
Lindsay, Seymour llalpern, Alex
l’irnie, Charles lioodcll and Frank
llorton. It would be even nicer
to get rid of Katherine St. lieorge,
(‘arleton .J. King, l’rank Becker,
John l’illion, (‘larence Kilburn and
Sin-yen B. Deroiinian.

.lavits and Keating have lots of
work to do in New York State. be—
fore trying to reform the Republi—
can party on the national level.
