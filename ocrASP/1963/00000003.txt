Instructor Publishes Poems

by Dave Jenlu
Bessie Bell

Please tell me, Bessie Bell. my
dear,

Why you are still available.

You’re pretty as silk and you sing
like a bird,

But your heart seems unassailable.

You’re tidy and neat, you’ve got
pretty feet
And an outstanding personality.
But from all that i hear, when it
comes to the boys.
You’ve yet to lear impartiality.
—Roy L. Hill

This poem is one of a collec—
tion written by Albany State Eng—
lish instructor, Mr. Roy Hill. Add—
ing his name to the list of Albany
professors who have writtenbooks,
Mr. Hill, recently had a collection
of his poems published in a book
entitled Corrie J. Carroll and Other
Poems.

Although he has written poetry
for his own enjoyment all his life,
Mr. Hill did not take itup seriously
until recently.

Started by Challenge

it happened that some of his
students who had read his prose.
asked if he would write some
poetry for them to read. He said
that he did not wish to, but ac—
cepted the students’ dare. in
answer to the challenge he began
writing verse and his recently
published book ofpoems has proven
beyond a doubt his skill.

llt’t‘l iigir

Mr. Hill states that from his early
childhood he “suffered from an
intense desire to communicate.”

The form of creative writing
which he is most interested in is
the short story. He feelslthat in
a world such as exists today where
everything is rush and hurry, the
short story is very popular and
thus he can communicate to a
greater number of people through
it.

Poets Not Made

He has developed a theory ofhis
own about poets.

“Poets are not ‘made’.” he
maintains, “no workshop, no
amount of teaching can make a
poet.”

He adds that to begin with a true
poet needs imagination and in—
sight which cannot be taught.

“it is possible to improve
quality. yet the extent or degree to
which this quality can be improved
depends upon the student’s talent
and industry as well as his will—
ingness to accept constructive
criticism.

“At first it is hardon any sensi—
tive student to have his poems
ruthli-ssly dissected by another.

“ llmvcvcr afte r the initial shock,
the amateur poct usually finds
hlnlSt‘lf participating enthusiasti—
cally in tho criticalgive andtakc."

Mr. Hill has had several other
books publishcd: Two Ways and other
Stories, Who's Who in the American
Negro Press, Richard Carroll (a
biography). andLiglit for the Blind
(a novel).

by Paul Jensen

it has long been law that, at the
start of each new year, every mo-
tion picture critic must listthe ten
best films released the previous
year. Not to be outdone by Bosley
and Dwight, this reviewer plans two
such lists. Due to my limitcd
viewing I’ve been unable to see Q
the films that were in their first
runs during 196?.

in addition, thanks to commer-
cial revivals, l.F.tl. and (even)
'l‘\’, many of the pictures l hayc
sccn were originally releascdscy-
cral years before. Therefore, two
lists—thc 196‘} films thiswcck, thc
others after final exams.

The Best — Alphabetically

The first film is Billy Budd. l)cs—
pitc one ortwoqucstionablc points,
which scem cspccially minor on
second yicwing, it effectively prc—
scnls the. thcsis that “eycn he who
wiclds the whip” must obcv lllt‘

against him. l‘Tyccllcntacting, lini-
direction, and maryclous photog—

.lohn l’i‘ankcnhcimcr’s dirci-tion
of Birdman oi Alcatraz is hisbcst to
datc. and Burt lancastcr as llobert
Stroiid gives onc of his fcw finc
pcrformanccs. Although slightly
ovi-rlong, it retains its fascination
throughout. Harold Lloyd's World of
Comedy is a hilarious compilation
of scenes from his old films. 'l’hc
final “buitiling-climbing” sc—
qiii-nr-c is a fantastic combination
of thrills and laughtcr.

ltalv’s La Notte, (intentionally)
slow and plodding, boasted nearly
superb performances by Mastroi—
anni and Moreau, as well asdircc-
tion by Antonioni. Non-communi—
cation and the decadence ofmodcrn
society are just two of the themes
explored.

Last Year at Marienbad is one of
the most in to re s t i n g, albeit the
strangest, of the New Wave of
French films. This is a cinema
poem by Alain Rcsnais, thc story
of which moves unprcdiclablyback
and forth in timc.

"L0" is High on List

Amci'ican, though filmcd mostly

lliiiversity Confederation

Fights Against

Tuition

by Libby Stroud

Last year at Cortland, the (“on—
lederated Student Governments of
the State University of New York
was established. This year, once
again at Cortland, the Confedera—
tion faced an issiii- that has in—
fluenced its actions since itscrca—
tion: tuition.

The Confederation was organ-
ized to create and maintain a body
“'l‘hrough which united action
which can benefit State ['nivcrsity
of New York students may be co-
ordinated.” Coordinationofaction
is primary in the cause of li‘t‘t‘
education; it is csscntial, Last
vcar at a May meeting, the (‘on—
l'cdcration adopted a resolution
which “uncompromisinglyH op-
