Unknowns Swamp KB
To Top AMIA Kegling

The mighty Unknowns are now in
first place in the AMIA Scratch
League by a comfortable margin of
five games. lnthisweek’s matches
KB was the victim of the powerful
Unknown team. In the other results
Potter beat the Goobers 5-2. the
Sophs beat the men of TXO 5—2,
and Waterbury knocked off the
Newman Club 5—2.

The KB team went into the
match with the Unknowns with a
two game lead in first place as a
result of 7—0 trouncing of Potter
last week. But this week was a
different story. The Unknowns
started out strong and were never
headed. They won the first game
855—778. the second game 778-769,
and the third game 858 819.

Dave Roeg‘ner is the man re—
sponsible for the destruction of KB.
Dave bowled games of 190, 177.
and 223 for a total of 5901 it
was Roeg‘ner who spoiled KB’s ef—
fort to salvage the last game as
he poured in five straight strikes
to personally nail the lid on KB’s
coffin.

1n the Potter—Goober match A1

Sabo lead the Club to victory. Al
had games of 198. 196, and 147
for a 541. It was Sabo’s big 196
that provided the margin ofvictory
for Potter in the second game. as
the Club won the game by one pin,
795-7941 Dick Kimball bowled a
fine 526 in a losing effort for the
Goobers.

In the Soph-TXO match it was
the bowling of Jon Barden and
Mike Putney that lead to the Soph
victory. Barden pounded the
maples for a fine 557 series on
games of 163, 212. and 18?. Put—
ney had a 527 with a high game of
182. Bill Branick had a lesingle
and Jim Morgan a 530 triple for
TXO.

1n the Waterbury—Newman Club
match Don Hale had high series
of 537 on games of 167, 188. and
182.

Roegner had high triple for the
day with his 590, followed by Rar—
den. 557, Sabo. 541, Hale, 537,

Frosli Cogers Winless
As Alums Romp 72 - 41

Last Saturday‘s cage game at the
Washington Ave. Armory saw the
frosh fall before the Alumni team
by a final tally of 72-41. The

in the secondquarter. however, the
freshmen cut the margin to 20—15
on strong offensive board control,
but this was a close as they were
to come after the opening moments
as the Alumni pulled out all the
stops and found the range to roar
to a 41—21 halftime lead.

The second half was more bal—
anced, although the Alums con-
tinued to gain. point by point, until
with 7:32 left in the. game, the
victors attained a thirty—point
bulge which they held throughout
the duration of the game.

Free Substitution

As the game progressed and the
outcome became apparent. men
wore substituted quite frocly by
both benches as all the playors on
both teams saw action. with the

Spinning the
Sports Wheel

by Bill Colgan

When State basketball left the infamous confines of
the Page band box last year for the long—awaited Mecca
of the Washington Armory, it appeared that the ultimate
had been reached in improving sports here at State
for the next millenium or two. But hold!

Hardly had this deed been done, when miraculously
a new baseball field appeared inthe West on the College
Field, put there mainly through the efforts of the well—
known landscaping company of Burlingame, Garcia, &
Co. «the company being provided by the freshmen gym
classes). But one further wonder was to be beheld on
the College Field at summer’s end, when real grand-
stands greeted returning State fans who were used to
providing their own standing at soccer games.

With these genuine improvements, it appeared that
nothing more could be expected before the University’s
scheduled move to the land of Milk and Honey. The
status quo appeared set for the next few years. But
man, puny creature, is no match for the rapid techno—
logical change that marks the modern world.

State’s own radio station, \VSUA, is soon to begin
regular broadcasting. 1f plans now in the works go
through, coverage will be given to several basketball
games. it is hoped that a live hook—up can be arranged,
but if this proves impossible the games will be broad—
cast from tapes on a delayed 45 minute basis.

Now it doesn’t take much figuring to see what this
means to sports here at State. Radio coverage could
be expanded to other sports, giving the teams here the
biggest audiences they’ve over had. In Short, gm“.
sports could be given a tremendous shot in tho arm.
\\’Sl.‘A just might usher in a now era in sports.

Sauersmen to “Entertain” Siena
ln Annual Game Tomorrow Nite

by Gary Smith

Fresh from an 81—56 victory
over llarpur College last Saturday
night. the varsity basketball team
prepares for the “big” game of
the year against Siena College this
Saturday at the Armory.

Earlier this year the Peds were
beater by Siena 60—52 in the Capi—
tol DistrictC‘hristmas Tournament
in which the Feds finished third.
The team will be anxiousto avenge
this setback. Previous to this
earlier season loss the l’eds had

defeated the lndians three years
running.

Perhaps the most thrilling was
last year’s 49—47 State victory
which was decided on a lastsecond
hook shot by JimOppedisano. When
these squads get together anything
can happen and usually does.

The squad, whose record now
stands at 5 wins and 6 losses will

gamo—onding

on Saturday night.

Siena, who record—wise is having
one of its best seasons in recent
years, will be lead by Gene Cul—
nan and All—Tourney selection
Marty Canavan. The lndians cap-
tured the Christmas Tournament
and are always a rough team
against State.

Height—wise neither team has
the advantage. but Siena plays a
slow. deliberate ball control type
of game and usually hits on a high
percentage of shots. It should be a
defensive battle as both schools
stress this phase of the game.

11 should br- an excellent game
and student support is going to be
needed to help the team come out
victorious. Siena is sure to have
a large. vociferous crowd on hand
at the game and only a larger,
more vociferous crowd from State
can hope to cheer the l’eds to
victory.

Students are advised to bring
their student tax cards tothe game
whero tickets will be given out to
gain admittance to the game.

Rout Harpur

ln winning the llarpur game. the
Feds played the best brand of ball
that we have seen in recent weeks.
I'p to now they seemed to lack
somo necessary spark to bring
them victory in the Close games
that up—to—now the team had been
losing. It looks as though the
team might have found the missing
ingredient against llarpur.

The team placed four men in
double figures in running up their
single game season high total. Co—
captain Don 1)el.uca paced the
squad with 19 points, chiefly onthe
strength of his deadly jump shot.
De[.uca played one of the best
games that he’splayedthis season.

Sophomore Dick Ci‘ossett. who
has played sparkling ball all year
long, was next with 17 markers
as well as a bevy of rebounds.

Always dependable co—captain
Jim t'lppedisano chimed in with 15
points. The fourth man in double
figures for the Purple and (101d
was Junior Ray Weeks whose sharp
oyo ncttcd him 13 points. Mention
must also be made of Joe l.oudis
who played a strong floor game for
tho home team.

Fast Start
