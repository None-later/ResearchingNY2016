MYSKANIA Has Active Year Developing Programs
for Freshman and Transfer Student Orientation

MYSKANIA, the judicial body
on this campus, during the last
two semesters fulfilled its pur-
poses of deciding legal questions
and acting as the guardian of the
freshman class.

Starting as soon as its term
began, MYSKANIA began to push
for a new program for frosh ori—
ientation. This program was con—
ceived through the actions of
MYSKANIA and the aid of the ad—
ministration particularly the Stu—
dent Personnel Office.

MYSKANIA began its‘search for
a better orientation program by
writing letters to more than 50
colleges inquiring about theirpro-
grams for incoming students.

The next step was beginning a
long series oftalks with Dr. Clifton
Thorne and Mr. Neil C. Brown of
the Student Personnel Office.

Brood Scope

MYSKANIA attempted to formu—
late the purpose of FroshOrienta—
tion and correlated activities -
Frosh Weekend, Rivalry, and the
College Handbook.

The program as it was finally
presented included a series of
meetings in Page Hall. Dr. Edith
0. Wallace gave a talk on the his—
tory of the school. Mr. Neil C.
Brown spoke on the present, and
Colonel Walter .M. Tisdale spoke of
the future in his presentation in—
cluding an illustrated section on the
new campus.

Also in the Page I-Iall series
were meetings about the Student
Government, chaired by Student
Association President Steve Con—
dojani, and about thc library fa-
cilities.

The second major part of the
orientation program was a series
of meetings chaired by faculty
members and student advisers.
Each freshman was assignedth
faculty member and a student.

The administration accepted
all of the students nominated by
MYSKANIA for the student ad—
visorships.

MYSKANIA hit the headlines, not
for its biggest accomplishment—
the orientation program, but for a
supposed apology to the mayor.

The episode began when sup-
pression ran an editorial on the
local police force. The editors of
last: year’s suppression visitedthe
mayor. The editors of suppression
were considered to have some of—
ficial connection with either stu—
dent government or the college
administration.

No Apology

MYSKANIA visited Mayor Corn-
ing and explained the position of the
suppression editors. Theyalsoex-
plained the views of the student
body. They made no apology.

Suppression reacted to this visit
to the mayor as if it were a sell-
out of the students to the local
officialdom.

In time. the misunderstandings
of suppression, about the action of
MYSKANIA were corrected.

.\IYSI\'.\.\'I.\, working with Stu-
dent .«\ssociation officers, aided in
the establishment of a Student—
Faculty Committee.

The first meeting of this group
concerned itself with the new 'am—
pus and attempts to reduce the
problems that will arise during
the moving from the old to the
new campus.

With regard to its judicial role
MYSKANH made three decisions.

The first decision allows the
president of Student Associationto
appoint cabinet members as he ot'
she sees fit. The question arose
when our current president,
Stephen Condo jani, appointed cab~
inet members whose positions are
not specifically mentioned in the
constitution and left vacant posi—

 

TUITION ODDITIES

The Board of Trustees chose to
meet during the period of finalex-
aminations.

The Iioard met in NewYorkCity
where its actions will not have It
dirt-ct cffect. (Thr- wording of thc
decision has led many to believe
that thc state will cut its support
of thc f'ity Colleges if tuition is
not imposed.)

tion specifically named in the con—
stitution.

MYSKANIA ruled that the pro—
vision empowering the SA Presi—
dent to fill cabinet position as he
or she sees fit includes leaving
positions unfilled as well as cre-
ating new ones.

The second decision involved the
question ofcensorship. MYSKANIA
ruled that censorship is an extra-
ordinary matter and thus rests
only within the jurisdiction of
MYSKANIA.

The third interpretive question
arose over a tie vote in a Senate
meeting. The question involvedthe
ability of the presiding officer, in
this case the SA President, to
break a lie.

The rules followed by Senate
allow a presiding officer to break

‘a tie, if that officer is a member
of the “assembly.” MYSKANIA
refused to decide the question and
stated that Senate should decide the
question by amending its rules or
the constitution.
Current Activities

MYSKANIA has also been active"
in working with Pat Cerra ’64 and
the rest of Senate’s iovernment
Reorganization Committee. The
results of this work have not as
yet been announced.

MYSKANIA is currently consid—
ering a fund raising drive for the
James A. Warden Memorial Fund.
This is a scholarship fuan which
operates at this l'nivursity.

 

Inter-Sorority Council

ISC Aims to Improve,

Not to Prove

by Sue Murphy

There are on this campus many
organizations whose functions and
accomplishments have remained
unknown to a large part of the
student body. Such an organiza—
tion is ISC, Inter—sorority Council.

The Freshman Handbook states
that the purpose of ISC is to foster
friendly relations between sorori—
ties and to act as the enforcement
body of the rushing code. This first
purpose is carried out in a myriad
of ways.

Each of the eight. sororitiespar-
ticipatc in exchange dinners during
which two members from each
sorority “change houses” for the
evening. There is also the com-
munal effort to strengthen faculty—
sludcnt relations throuin the fac-
ulty coffee hours planned for the
afternoons of the faculty meetings.

Threat Unites Sorority Effort

(inc. of the greatest illustrations
of united effort has become visible
in the last year. Be cause of the,
possible dissolution of sororities
threatened by the move to the ncw
campus, the sororities havc comc
together rather than work separ—

ately. As a result of this union,
many things have been accom—
plished.

Sororities have paused to con—
sidcr themselves as organizations
with many different purposes,
aims, and obligations. ISC has
drawn up a “Code,” that is, :

Reviewer Evaluates Advanced llr

During the semester just past,
we saw thc Advanced Il‘amatics
class present, all told, eight short

given early in the semester, while
the second was givon during the
last \ycek before exams.

We think its timc for an evalua—

rectors accomplished with their
plays. l“ollo\\'iiig will bc our rank—

STATE UNIVERSITY NEWS, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1963

News Board

(continued from p9. I, col. 4)

the contest to name the tempo ‘arily
dubbed State College News. Ap—
parently there was an early lack
of participation, and the News
Board is proud to announce, forty—
seven years later, the winners —
News Board.

The first picture appeared in
the News November 8, 1916: a
lovely depiction of Miss Jack ('2)
Wilbur and Mr. Edwyn Johnstone
dancing. The purpose of the photo
was to lure students into lessons
in the gymnasium.

The venerable predecessor of
College Calendar, Campus Cur-
rent, Current Comment, and Cul—
turc Corner was Kolletch Komick

Ode Upon
the Advent
of Marks
Coming Out

I don't find any students making
a fuss
If they get an A— instead of A+.
The thing that I see raising ire
to highncss
ls getting I’o instead of .\—.
And the teachers at timcs make
this even worse
Ilv putting a sr-cond
first.
If I'm it borderline caste.
tcachcr, show kindness-—
Don't giyc me the plus; I’d much
prefer minus!
Or if you can‘t do that, would you
picasc gch me
(It won‘t bc so frustrating)——just
a plain il'.‘ by Patricia Jewell
