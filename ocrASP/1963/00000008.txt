Spinning the
Sports Wheel

by Bill Colgan ..-J- ‘, 5.3

What to do? What to do? Now we know how Winchell
felt when Germany invaded Poland. Tuition’s on every—
one’s minds. Tuition and picketing are the big news.
But the sports wheel must continue to spin (Ah! A new
motto. Sure beats that “Fifty—four forty or Fight” bit),

Well, as a starter, we’d like to tell all State’s
basketball fans how fortunate they were in getting that
generous four day inter—semester “vacation.” Lucky
fans, you only missedthe wildest, roughest, and wooliest
baskeball game played this side of the Pecos all year.

In as sharp a piece of scheduling as there ever was,
State’s cagers played two “home” games in the Wash—
ington Armory last weekend while the brunt of the
student body was scattered over the snow fields and
glaciers of New York State. The first contest was a
Ho-Hum affair as the Peds took Utica for a 77—54 ride.

State tried to entertain Adelphi (that’s a college that
calls the sand bar east of New York City home) in the
Armory Saturday, but Adelphi didn’t stay for the whole
party. In a rather unusual maneuver, the courtmen from
the sand bar walked off the court with eleven minutes
left in the game to hand State the contest via a forfeit.

What led up to this exodus was a game which marked
a return to the good old days of football. This was a
game for men, and elbows, and shoulders, etc. Both
sides were going all out, and several fights nearly
erupted. State was leading 49—44 when a double penalty
was called on both teams. This led to the Adelphi
coach making like Moses, as he led his players out of
the wilderness of the Armory. But it’s just as well
all you lucky fans missed this. It might have made
Cecil B.’s ghost jealous.

Plans Meeting;
Novices Needed

The S.U.A. Fencing Society will
hold its first meeting of this se—
mester Wednesday night, February
13, at 7:30 p.m. in Sayles Gym.

The fencing club will be divided
into two groups: one group will
consist of students with previous
experience and the other will be
composed of novice fencers.

The advanced fencers, number-
ing nine, will put the major em-
phasis on bout work. Particular
attention is being paid to this as-
pect of the sport because the ad-
vanced fencers will compete in
seven matches during this semes—
ter.

However, the most significant
aspect will be the role of the be-
ginners. The club hopes to have at
least eight to ten beginners, but
the more that attend, the better
the chances for development of
the team. The beginners will study
mainly the theory of fencing and
the fundamental movements:

The society is now in the process
of trying to acquire an appropriate
insignia, and is also working on
the problems of collecting dues:
these problems willbe discussed at
the meeting.

it is advised for those who wish
to come to dress in a sweat shirt,
slacks. and sneakers.

'l‘he Fencing Society is one of
the newer athletic clubs at State
College. It provides a fine chance
for State students to learn some—
thing about a relatively unknown
sport.

To Close AMIA Kegling

The fight for first place really
tightened up in the AMIA Scratch
League this week. Both KB and the
Goobers gained ground on the first
place Unknowns, with both teams
being tied for second place only
two games behind the Unknowns.

In the big match of the week KB
rebounded from its shellacking by
the Unknowns two weeks ago. and
trounced this same team 5—2 to
move within two games of first
place. At the same time the G00-
bers ran all over TXO 7—0, to tie
KB for second place behind the
Unknowns.

in the other results Waterbury
swamped the Sophs 7~O, and New—
man Club emerged victorious in
the battle of “the Clubs,” as they
knocked off Potter 4 1/2 to 2 1/2.

In the KB—Unknowns match it
was a team effort all the way that
led to the victory of the KB team.
Kirk Ellis led the way as he hit
a rousing 556, and he had strong
support from Tony Riservato with
a 511 and Dave Rowley with a 506.

Not to be overlooked is Bruce
Rogers’ steady bowling.

The Unknowns did some fine
bowling themselves in going down
to defeat. Dave Roegner did the
heroics in the first game as he
hit a fine 213 to hand his team the
victory by only nine pins. Roegner
also wound up the day with a 579
triple. Phil Thomas hit a respect-
able 538 in a futile attempt to stop
the KB men.

in the Goober—Txo match Mert
Sutherland led the (loobe rs to their
victory as he hit a fine 560 with a
208 single. Also contributing
heavily to the Goober win was Jim
Gittleman who pounded the maples
for a 533.

In the Waterbury—Sophs match
there were several high singles
and triples recorded, mostly by
the Waterbury men. Leading the
Waterbury team were Don llale
with a 553 triple and 212 single,
A] Barnard, 527. and Dick Fair—
bank, 516. John Long hit a 2l0
single for the losing Soph team.
