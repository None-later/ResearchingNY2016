INFERIORITY CAN BE FUN

The second gravest problem confronting college students to-
day is inferiority feelings. (The ﬁrst gravest problem is of
course, the recent outbreak of moult among sorority house
canaries.) Let us today look into the causes of inferiority
feelings and their possible cures. I .

Psychologists divide inferiority feelings into three pl‘lllCIpitl
categories:

1. Physical inferiority.

2. Mental inferiority.

3. Financial inferiority.

(A few say there is also a fourth category: iehthyologieal
inferiority—a feeling that other people have. prettier fish~
but I believe this is common only along the coasts and in the
Great Lakes area.) ,

Let us start with the feeling of physical inferiority, perhaps
the easiest to inulerstand. Naturally we are inclined to feel
inferior to the brawny football captain or the beautiful home-
coming queen. But we should not. Look at all the people,
neither brawiiy nor beautiful, who have made their marks in
the world. Look at Napoleon. Look at Socrates. Look at
Caesar. Look at. Lassie.

    

 

 

vrrrr/ /‘ nlf/ ['/‘
What I mean is that you can’t always tell what's inside a
package by looking at the outside. (Sometimes, of course, you
can. Take Marlboro ('igarcttcs, for example. Just one glance
at that jolly red-aiid—white package so bright and pert so
neat but not gaudy so perfectly in place whether you are at
a formal dinner or a beach picnic so invariably correct for
any time, clinic, or condition one look, I say, at this paragon
of packs and you lrirou- it has to contain cigarettes of absolute
perfection. And you are right? That pure white .\larlboro
filter, that line, Ila‘.'oi‘flil blend of .\larlboro Iolrnct'os, will
give you a smoke to make the w'clkin ring, whatever that is.
So those of you who have just been sitting and admiring your
.\larlboro packs since tlic beginning of the semester, why don't
you open a pack and light onc'.’ Light n cigarette, l mcaii
not the package. Then you can settle back and smoke your
.\Iai'lboro and, at the saint- iiinc, continue to gaze rapturoust
at the pack. Thus you will be twice as happy as you are if
that is possible.)

hit I digress. Let us IllI'Ii now to the sci-ond category
inciital inferiority. .\ lot of pcoplc think they are dumber than
other people. 'l'liis is not so. It must be remembered that there
are Iffjli/‘r/il kind» or intclligciicc lake, for instance, the cla»

l Campus Current I

by Sandy Donaldson

Are You A Man Or A Sheep?

Why do so many people eagerly read the “Best
Sellers” list, and m read the books?— or say that a
movie must be good because it won an award, didn’t
it?—or change their opinion about a popular record
because it is number one on the “Top Ten” list.

Dozens of different fashion magazines are sold to
teenagers, college girls, working girls, and house-
wives—and as a result the dress industry in New York

City does a tremendous mass production business.

Sometimes even our thoughts and opinions are in—
fluenced by what is presented to us in books, the
papers, and—worst of all—on television. Many people
are ashamed to have different ideas for fear of being
termed eccentric or odd.

Of course. it isn’t possible to have a separate
opinion for each person—no one can have a completely
isolated, original ideas all the time. Yet ifthere is
an opinion to be held on an important issue such as
tuition, be sure it is through through and seen from
as many sides as possible.

Have we set aside our own standards of judgment
and adopted those of the few leaders of “the masses”
or shrewd businessmen?

We admire those individuals who judge for them—
selves and read, see, and choose what interests them.
Yet don’t we—the masses, ourselvos~look .it those
few as being a bit eccentric, and then go our “own”
way?

I surely don’t suggest sewing your own clothes,
boycotting Best Sellers ('To Kill A Mockingbird was vcry
enjoyable), movies or records. Nor do I advocate, top—
position to everything that the majority supports just
for the sake, of being different. Instead, my plea is
for less conformity and more, individuality.

The purpose of this new system
is, according to Piret Kutt. “to
try to make this more ofan honor."

An amendment was proposed
making possible the use of rec—
ommendations from the budgetary
organizations besides the activity
sheets in nominating candidates.
.\fter much discussion labeling
this as “tooidealistic” the amend—
ment was defeated.

John 'l‘yo, S..\, vice president,
introduced a new plan for the pas—
sing of budgets. The plan was
unanimously passed.

Tax Card System

line to an inefficient system of
replacing lost tax cards, it is now
possible for studentstoobtainsev~
cral tax cards, and to put them to
various uscs. \\'ith the new ad-
ministration, a new system will
lit' cStilliliSIiI‘tl,

If a tax card is lost, there will
he a specified time each \vcck
when someone will be issuing new
cards to those who are able to
prove they lost theirs. This will
eliminate some present problems
involving other local colleges.
