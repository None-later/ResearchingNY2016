Griffin’s ‘Blaek like Me’ Reveals
Southern Attitude toward Negro

by J. A. Game:

Black Like Me by John Howard Griffin

John Howard tlriffin is an .\mer-
ican novelist who, thus far, has not
received much of the. regonition he
deserves. Both ofhis novels. The
Devil Rides Outside and Nunt', dis-
play c rafts man sh i p and rich,
thought—prmtoking content. but iin—
tortunately, noith e r book has
reached a wide audience.

in his latest effort, which won

     

(Author of “I Was a Teen-age Dwarf,” “The Many
Loves of Dobie Gillie,” etc.)

the 1962 Saturday Review Anis-
field—Wolf Award, Griffin leaves
the genre of the novel and turns
to a semi—journalistic. account of
his recent personal experiences.

Mr, Griffin, a Caucasian whose
forefathers were important in the
history of (leorgia, underwentdan-
gerous ultraviolet lighttretitments
in order to temporarily become a
Negro. Black Like Me is the re—
port of his journey through the
Southern states.

Paul Ford, ‘ ever Too Late’ Star,
Grants Interme' After NY. Comedy

by Steven Kat:

Playing presently at the. Play—
house Theater iii New York City
is the hilarious comedy “ Never'l‘oo
Late.” This play is the debut by a

new playwright, Sumner Arthur
Long. The stars of “Never Too
Late” are Patti Eord, Maureen

O'h‘ullivan, and Orson Bean.

“Never Too Late" is a comedy
that concerns a middle—aged couple
who are about to become. parents
for the second time, They haye a
twenty-one year old daughter who
is married to a scared son~in—law
who lacks confidence. The light-
hearted plot of the play concerns
the shock of the expectation of a
baby.

l’aul Ford, who plays the roleof
the expectant father. was inter—
viewed after the Saturday matinee
performance of February '2.

Hr. l’oi‘tl cx’celleiitly portrays
this role with vitality.

\lr, Ford's lines areverv funny;
he seems to carry the whole show.
.\lr_ t"ord told me that he did not
get itito show business until tit-was
forty. .\'ow l’aul l’oi‘d is one of the
most sought after performers. llis

branches of

ko Show" and Colonel Purdy in
“Teahouse of the August Moon."
Presently Mr. Ford is inthe movie
production of “The Music Man" in
which he plays the role of Mayor
Shinn.

Last season .\lr. Ford starred
in the Broadway production “A
Thurber Carnival" with Peggy
Cass and Tom Ewell.

.\ir. l’ord above all prefers act—
ing on the Broadway stage. He feels
it gives him a “feeling ofpersonal
contact with the audience.”

O'Sultlvon Missing

“hen I saw the show, .\laureen
(l’b'ultivan was absont from the
cast because of the death of her
husband, John l-‘arrow. Lorraine
.\lac.\l:trrin, .\liss (t'Sullivan's un-
derstudy, was a capable Edith
latmbci‘t.

ttt‘son Bean was superb in the
role of the son—in-law.

the direction by (leorge .\bbott
was displayed with skill and the
sets atid lighting by \\'illiam and
.lean l'Tckart were appropriate and
realistic. the costumes by Flo—
retice. l\'lot7. were pleasantly at—
tractive.

“Ni-yer 'l'oo latte” isahilarious
show with the idea of sex later in
a marriage handled with goodtaste.
It you want to spend an evening
laughing, see “.\‘cver latte"
at the l’layhouse 'l‘ht-atre on West
ltith Street in New York.
