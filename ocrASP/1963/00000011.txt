AMIA Kegling Race Knotted Up
As KB Catches & Ties

Things tightened up a bit in the
AMIA Scratch Bowling League this
week. The Unknowns put a little
more distance between them and
the challenging Goobers as they
beat the latter team 5-2.

In losingtwo points the Unknowns
found themselves sharing their
first place lead with the up and
coming Kappa Beta team. KB
downed the Newman Club 7—0 to
pick up two points on the Unknowns.
In other results, Waterbury heat
TXO 5—2, and the Sophs knocked
off Potter 5—2.

Don Hale walked off with all
honors this week as he copped
high single, 235, and high triple,
635. Hale’s high single is good
for second high single for the year,
and his triple marks a new high

for the season.

If it had not been for a ten—pin
tap Hale would have had ten strikes
in a row in one game!

In the Unknowns-Goobers match
all three games were close. The
Unknowns pulled the first and the
third games out in the tenth frame,
while the Goobers won the second
game by only 19 pins.

Phil Thomas was the leading
bowler for the Unknowns as he hit
a fine 578 with a 216 single. Bill
Thomas and Dave Roegner hit 532
and 524, respectively, in leading
the Unknowns to victory. Thomas
also hit a 216 single.

.\lert Sutherland and Jim (little—
man hit 526 and 510 respectively
for the (ioobe rs.

In the KB—Newman Club match,

Unknowns

Kirk Ellis hit a 206 single and a
523 triple, while Tony Riservato
hit a 539 in leading the KB team
to victory. Don Fear had a 224
single and 566 triple.

It was the clutch bowling of
Riservato in the tenth frame of
the last game that gave KB the
victory. He came through with a
big double to provide the margin
of victory in the last game, won
by KB by only 13 pins.

In the Sophs—HEP match Jon
Burden led the Sophs to victory
as he hit a 202 single and 536
triple. John Lilga led the Potter
team with a 505 triple.

.e\l Drake had a 527 triple for
TXO in losing to Waterbury. Need—
less to say Don Hale paced the
\\’aterbury team.

Spinning the
Sports Wheel

by Bill Colgan

 

The next time we make a crack about demised movie
magnates please tell us to pack up our sports wheel and
return to the sand bar. Hardly had our misdeed come
before the eyes of our public, when an event occurred
here at State which would have done justice to any
Frank Capra movie.

The event, of course, was the birth of an eight pound
eight ounce boy (James Frank) to Mr.and Mrs. Op—
pedisano. Better known as the “Op,” the proud papa
rates as one of State’s all—time great basketball play—
ers, being only the third player in the school’s history
to pass the magic thousand point mark.

Things haven’t gone as well for “Op” this year as
in previous seasons. But in one of those “better than
fiction” moments last Friday he led State’s cagers to
their biggest victory of the season, a 69—67 downing
of a highly rated Merrimack five. He did this just
hours after the birth of James Frank.

Netting 23 points on six field goals and 11 free
throws “Op” played his best game of the year. His
all—around play and clutch shooting proved to be the
difference in this squeaker. It was no accident that
the team sparkled in this encounter as it hasn’t all
year.

So in conclusion we’d like to add our Congratula—
tions to the many “Op” and the Mrs. have already
received.

SAUERSMEN TO PLAY TWO HOME GAMES THIS WEEKEND!

Central Conn. Snaps Win Stein;

by Gary Smith

The Albany State varsity basket-
ball team won its fourth straight
game in a row and then lost its
ninth game to an undefeated team
in action on the hardwoods last
weekend.

The squad took the Warriors
from Merrimack College into camp
on Friday nightbefo re a good crowd
in the Armory. The visitors came
into the game with a fine 11-2 rec-
ord for the season. They were led
by the high scoring Jerry Stopyra
who was averaging 22 points a
game.

\\'ell, not only did the team’s
defense stop {\Ir. Stopyra, but it
added another loss to the Merri—
mack slate. The game started
out in true neck and neck style as
both squads fought hard to gain
the upper hand.

Both Dick Crossett and Jim
Oppedisan'o paced the l’erls
throughout the game. ()pperlisano
appears to have found himself in
the last few games and is really
playing a winning braan of basket—
ball. This year‘s (.‘o—captain is to
be congratulated on his comeback.
lie is also to be congratulated on
becoming a father.

The score at half rcflcCch thc
high scoring braan of ball that has
characterized the recent l’ed
games as the Merrimack squadch
by 38—35 at intermission. The
visitors began to use an outside
weave in an attemptto springloose
some of their shooters at the end
of the first half.

When the squads returned to the
floor, the I’eds began to jump in
on the weave and as a result stole
the ball a number of timcs. This
brought the Purple and (Told from
the halftime deficit of 3 points to
an 8 point lead early in the second
half.

The \l'arriors drew closer on
the shooting of Smith and Stopyra
with about six minutes left in the
game. They pressed the locals
and caused them to make numerous
mistakes.

Season Record Stands at 9—9

 

    

Crossett fouled out of the game
after having scored 16 points but
Op and the rest of the squad took
up the slack to hold on for a well
earned 69-67 victory.

Oppedisano paced all scorers
with 22 points while Crossett hit
for 16 in the winning cause. Smith
was high for Merrimack while
Stopyra who was guarded by Joe
I.aurlis was held to 11 points.

On Saturday night the team took
to the road and traveled to New
Britain, Connecticut. to the pro-
verbial lion’s den to take on un-
beaten Central Connecticut State.

'l'his squad had won 15 straight
before meeting the Purple and
(told. The Sauersmen made the
locals fight hard for number 16
before bowing.

(‘entral Connecticut broke to an
early 10 point lead in the first
half as they managed to dominate
the boa rds. It should be noted that
one of the cogs in the wheel for
Albany, Dick Crossett, was outfor
much of the game with a bad knee
which has bothered him throughout
much of the season. This hampered
the team greatly off both boards
as well as offensively.

The I’eds came out strong for
the secoan half as they I‘cclctl off
13 straight points to take a 3
point lead after having becn down
by 10 points at halftime. The two
platoon system used by the home—
towncrs began to tell on the tired
Saucrsmen as both the bench
strength and height began to win
for the home team.

The l’eds have nothing to be
ashamed of, hmvevm‘, as this team
is onc of the bcst tcams we haw»
faced this ycar.

The rest of lllt‘ games for the
team this year are in the \\';ishing—
ton .\venuc .\i‘mory. 'I'onight the
Paris will face the Hawks of New
l’altz State whom thcy beatcarlier
in lhc year by a scant point. Then,
on Saturday, the l’eds will entertain
