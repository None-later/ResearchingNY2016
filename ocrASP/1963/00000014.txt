I smile and men think me happy; I sigh and men
think me sad. Yet I smile because I share a sorrow;
I may sigh because I share a joy. Ican laugh and be

not happy, cry and be not said.

I may be happy for

many hours, even for many days—yet I have not found

happiness.

Happiness is go_t a warm puppy or a climbing tree.
It is peace, security, being loved and loving - It can
be grasped but not held; it can be glimpsed but never
known, and the search brings but unhappiness to the

searcher.

It is though we walk down a long street. We are

looking for happiness.

But happiness is mounted on a
swift steed and we must follow on foot.

The rider

seems to beckon and wait—but then charges quickly on.
I follow, I try, but my way is paved with broken things—
lives, men, dreams, and the wayside is lined with those
who need and those who have too much, those who be—
lieve and those who mock, those who will but cannot
and those who can but will not.

And so I pause in my quest and look about. To go on
is futile. The road ahead brings but more of the same.

And for what shall I go

on—I shall never be able to

catch the horseman unless I can bring with me all that

inhabit the earth, now and

forever. None can be happy

until all the pain and poverty, the hatred and prejudice,
and all the evils of men have first been swept into the

abyss.

And so I stop. I speak to the child by my side. “Let

us go find a warm puppy
suffice until—-—-”

and a climbing tree. It will

The following is the platform of
Robert Judd, candidate for Vice
President of Student Association.

When asked for his platform,
Mr. Judd released the following
statement. “I have no platformas
such, for platforms imply prom—
ises. l have no authority to make
promises. But i do have opinions.

i would push for reapportionment
of Student Senate, anrl an immed—
iate and far-reaching Scholarship
program. i believe that o rganiza—
tions on campus should have more
of a say in the affairs of Senate.

“Because elections at State have
degenerated to the point of being
personality contests, l belieyethat
my type of personality should be
represented.
