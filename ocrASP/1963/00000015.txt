0f the Vice-President

The following is the platform of
Frederick Genero. candidate for
Vice President of the Student As-
sociation:

According to Article 3. section
28 of the Constitution of Student
Association, the duties of the Vice
President shall be:

1) To assume the duties of the
President at his request or in case
of his absence.

2) To coordinate all the com—
mittees out of Senate.

3) To serve as a non-voting
member of the Senate.

4) To serve as a Cabinet mem-
ber.

In addition to the above, the Vice
President also serves as treasurer
of Senate. Cabinet, and contingen—
cy. Is this all that the Vice Pres-
ident should do? Should he be only
a treasurer?

It is my belief that the important
officer should go beyond the role
of treasurer, beyond the now anti—
quated bounds which have confined
his activities in the past.

With this end in mind, I present
the following platform:

1) The appointment of a special
committee to consider the impor—
tance and value of “Cabinet.” It
has been extremely efficient inthe
past, but it can be even more effi—
cient. and become one of the most
important and valuable groups in
Student Association.

The Cabinet is becoming out—
moded because oftoo many Cabinet
posts, It can be decreased iiinum—
ber. and, at the same time. in-
crease its efficiency. The posts
are becoming merely “posts” and
it's becoming extremely difficult
to define their limitations.

2) To devote more time to ac—
tivities other than explicit duties.
While doing his mandated duties.
he should strive also to improve
relations with other colleges and
their Student Associations.

 

Rick Genera
Through conferences and meet-
ings with these other institutions,
many valuable ideas and plans may

be obtained. Such activities as
concerts and other professional

presentations, when sponsored
jointly. tend to promoteafeelingof
cooperation.

3) To take an active part in as
many special committees as pos-
sible.

4t) The \'ice President is in
charge of attendance. It is his
responsibility to “crack down”
on Senators who place a multitude
of other obligations above their
Senate obligation.

The Vice President should make
it apparent to Senate when student
representatives are missing meet—
ings excessively. In the recent
past. there have been altogether
too many excused absences. But
this is a Weakness of Senate itself.
and NOT of past Vice Presidents.

5) To help new organizations.
such as (‘ommuter’s Club, to get
on their feet and to stimulate.
promote, and otherwise aid in the
successful operation of these or-
gaiiizations.

Banmann, Cenero, and Judd Cive

WOULD YOU EXCUSE SENATORS FROM
ATTENDING SENATE AND COMMITTEE
MEETINGS FOR REASONS OTHER THAN
SICKNESS OR DEATH?

Nancy Baumonn: The Senate :it~
ti-ndance policy should be excused
absences oiin in case of sickness
and death in the family.

\iiy exceptions to this policy
should be up to thc discretion of
me Her: President. but I do not
agree with excusing Senators from
meetings several wet-ks in a row
due to a conflict in activities.

Frederick Genera : I feel th.it sit-k—
III‘SS and death are thc only rea—
sons for an i-xcusi-d absence from
.i Senator or t‘tilliilllllt‘f' tiici-tiiig‘.

Senators should place thi-irScii—

Presidential Candidates (the Answers to NEWS

DO YOU FAVOR THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF A COMMITTEE TO DEAL WITH
PROBLEMS ON THE NEW CAMPUS?

Conn: There is at present a
committee working on governmen—
tal problems on the new campus
(Government Reorganization Com—
mittee). I do not think there are
sufficient problems at this time to
warrant another committee inSen-
ate working on problems ofthe new
campus.

If some problems do arise within
the next year, they would probably
be best referred to Government
Reorganization Committee.

Tyo: I do not think a Senate
committee should be established
to deal with these problems. There
is in existence at the present time
a committee. “University Life—
1970," which is handling this mat—
ter.

I feel, as a member ofthiscom—
mittee. that most matters of ini—
portance, will be adequately dis—
cussed by this committee.

I believe, however, that if the.
students feel a need for publica—
tion and circulation of information
about the new campus. and the
need for gauging the subsequent
reaction of the students to the
plan. a cabinet post should be set
u .

pWhen we get to the new campus.
and the student body greatly in—
creases in size. then we are ready
for a change.
DO YOU FAVOR THE CONTINUATION
OF THE SENATE TUITION COMMITTEE?
Cerro: Yes, I believe that Tuition
Committee should be retained as
a Senate committee next year. The
picketting of the school and march
on the Capitol were. stated as“just
a beginning" of our fight against
tuition this year.

If we are to continue this fight.
the committee has to be, preserved
—there is much more that is vet
to be done.

Tyo: Yes, until the bills now
before the State. Legislature are
either passed or defeated.

VI MANY AND WHICH PEOPLE IN
IC'aARGE OF STUDENT ACTIVITIES DO
YOU THINK SHOULD RECEIVE SAL-
ARIES FOR THIS COMING YEAR? WITH-

IN TWO YEARS? '
Cerra: It is my personal feeling

that no one should be paid a salary
for extracurricular work on the
campus at this time. However. if
an equitable policy on salaries in
general Can be established, per-
haps some might then be awarded.

Tyo: I am in favor of a salary
for the editor of State University
News . I feel that the editor of
the News does as much work as
the SA. President and therefore
deserves a salary. Also. if the
editor of the Pedagogue can sup—
port his argument fora salary,
he should receive a salary.

I feel that now is the time to
be realistic about the salary is-
sue -— an inequality now exists.
There should be no salaries, or
more salaries. If I am elected.
I will give the editors an oppor-
tunity to discuss salaries in each
Senate committee.

If and when I am President, I

will exert all my influence in
favor of one or the other of the
alternatives — more salaries. or
no salaries.
DO YOU THINK THERE SHOULD BE A
SECOND BRANCH OF THE STUDENT
LEGISLATURE AND IF SO WHAT WOULD
BE ITS FUNCTIONS?

Cerra: The new plan of gov—
ernment for the new campus has
this feature -— a bicameral legis-
latiire.

The main purpose of this idea
is to relieve Senate of the tedious
chores it is tied down with now
which are above and beyond legis—
lation. For instance, preparation
of the bailch would be. taken care
of by the second house.

Tye: I fail to see the Ilt‘t‘tl for
another branch of the student leg—
islature and I emphasize the fact
that whether I am elected or not,

I will oppose any such plan.

()ur legislature and our gov—
ernment as a whole as it stands
is one of the finest in operation
in the State University system.
Why change it until it becomes
unworkable?

HOW AND WHEN SHOULD MEETINGS

WITH CABINET BE HELD?
Conn: The main purpose of a

Cabinet is to act as an advisory
organization to the executive. I
will definitely call Cabinet mect—
ings of this sort next year.

In the past, Cabinet has been a
figurehead organizaton; I hope to
mold it into aworkingorganization
with coordination meetings at least
once a month.

Tyo: The President should call
one or two organization meetings
immediately. After that, meetings
should be called by the S..\. Pres—
ident or Vice President when. in
the opinion of these two people, :1
meeting is necessary.

The meetings should be held on
'l'tiesday night so that a report can
be given to Senate on \\'edncsd;iv
night.

HOW SOON DO YOU THINK A REOR-
GANIZED STUDENT GOV'T SHOULD
BEGIN FUNCTIONING?

Cerro: .\s the new plan has re—
Centlv reached near—conileion, it
is quite feasible that changes in
the present government will bi;
initiated gradually over the next
few years.

I think it definitely should be in
operation before we get to the new
campus. in order to get the “bugs”
out of the plan as soon as possible.
The initiation ofsome parts should.
therefore. begin next year.

Tyo: 'l'hroughout my campaign I
have stated that I will oppose any
drastic change in our government.
I feel strongly that we are not
reain for a radical change and
won’t be for at least two or three
years.

ALIFIOATIONS—

Iyo: ‘Postpone Reorganization’
Work Within Existing System

The following is the platform of
John E. Tyo, candidate for Pres—
ident of Student Association.

As a candidate for the highest
office of Student Association, I
feel it is important for the voters
to know the objectives for which
I will strive ifI am elected. They
are as follows:

1. The first and most important
plank in this platform consists of
two separate but coordinate items:
a) a treasurer for Senate, Cabinet,
and Contingency, appointed by the
President and approved by Senate;
b) a plan designed to increase ef-
ficiency in Student Association fi-
nance, and, in so doing, earn money
to pay for part or all of the SA.
President’s salary.

The treasurer
books for Senate, Cabinet, and
Contingency Surplus Fund. This
will release the S.A. Vice Presi—
dent from the task, thus enabling
him to devote more time to special
duties assigned to him by the SA.
President.

The treasurer. working closely
with the Student—Faculty Associa-
tion accountant. will place certain
funds controlled by Student Asso—
ciation into the bank so that they

will keep the

coming Committee (3); and Par—
ents’ Day (‘ommittee (3).

will collect interest. Thus. S.A.
will benefit from a wise and effi—
cient utilization of its monetary
resources.

Advisory Board

2. An advisory board to work
with the executive branch of the
government. The purpose of this
group would be to discuss inform-
ally important matters with the
S.A. President. to establish di-
rection in the government, and to
evaluate and criticize the jobbeing
done by the S./\. President.

Members of the board would in-
clude an interested member of the
administration, three Senators,
one or two MYSKANIA members,
the editors of the Nova, some
members of the Cabinet, and any
others appointed by the President.

3. Continued work towards a
new government. Lastvyear. in
my campaign for S.A. Vice Pres—
ident, I stressed the need for a
committee which “will begin work
immediately on the changes that
will be necessary in student gov—
ernment when we move to the new
campus."

This committee became a reality
this past year. Pat Cerra, as
chairman. and the committee have
done an excellent job. I urge
further work in this area.

No Government Change

ilowever, whether I am elected
or not, I will vigorously oppose
any plan to change our government
within at least two years. I feel
strongly that our government is
sound and workable at the present
time. We are not ready for a
larger type of government—any
plan intending to effect drastic
changes in our government within
two years is unrealistic.

4. I urge that Student Associa—
tion vigorously attempt to arrange
Lao—sponsored concerts with Siena
College so that State’s students
might no longer be deprived of
some of the popular music groups
that perform before many larger
colleges.

I have worked towards such a
concert and I see no reason why
at least two such concerts (Broth—
ers li‘our. Peter, Paul, and Mary,
etc.) could not become a reality
next year. 'I‘hesc would be at low
cost to the students: profits would
go to charity.

S.A. Transportation

3. \I‘lltill on the transportation
issue. I urgi- that IIic President of
