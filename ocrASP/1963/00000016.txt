Spinning the I
Sports Wheel “‘

by Bill Colgan a '

   

While wandering around between halves at the New
Paltz game last Friday, we ran into a couple of old
friends from our rather spirited neighbor to the south.
Now, normally this would be a pleasant experience,
except these two observant females asked what was a
painfully obvious question, “Where are your cheer—
leaders?”

After stammering and stuttering pathetically (so we
wrote this listening to “Belafonte at Carnegie Hall,”)
we were forced to admit that we hadn’t the slightest
idea as to what was blowing in the winds of the Wash—
ington Armory.

This mystery of course had to be solved. So we
commissioned the renowned detective agency of Pinker—
ton, Holmes, and Colgan (the brunt of the case was
handled by the latter) to investigate. Aftertwenty min—
utes and two phone calls we discovered that State’s
new cheerleading system had been instigated by Coach
Hathaway for the following reasons.

(1) It was felt that cheerleading had been ineffective
this year.

(2) It was felt that one girl could do a better job of
whipping up the crowd than a group of girls .doinga
“show” before the stands.

While it is true that cheerleading hasn’t exactly
had a banner year at State, we question this decision.
It is impossible for one girl’s voice to carry over half
the Armory. It is difficult for one girl to go out on the
floor alone. And, if the crowds have been unresponsive
to five girls, will they pay attention to one?

WAA Basketball Potter Club Clinches Championship
In First AMIA Basketball loop

Season Opens;

Bowling Cont.

Gamma Kap met Alden and Psi
Gamma played Sig Alph for the
first games of the basketball sea—
son last night. Next Thursday.
March 7, Gamma Kap will play
Sig Alph and Bru will meet Kappa
Delta.

On this Tuesday, the six teams
in this league will meet for the
first time. The schedule will be
posted on the W. A. A. bulletin
board.

Carol Easton, \\i’.A.A. President,
hopes that all girls who are in—
terested in refereeing any basket—
ball games will notify her via
student mail.

Bowling Leagues

The bowling leagues, which are
half way through their season,
boast a total of sixteen teams.
In addition to the sorority and
dorm teams, the Newman Club
and Commute r’s Organization also
have teams.

in an attempt to revise the
\\".A.A. constitution two amend—

ments were passed. First, “Any
person who is nominated for Pres—
ident shall have served at least
five months on the Council.” Sec-
ondly, “Any person nominated for
Treasurer shall have served at
least five months on the Council."
The above amendments were
proposed in a general effort to
reorganize \i’.A.A, into a more
effective and efficient group.

The AMlA basketball season
came to a close this week, and
once again Potter Club displayed
its domination on the intramural
courts.

The men in black and white are
clear champions of three of the
four AMlA leagues. Only in the
second loop is the outcome in
doubt as EEP needed a victory
over the Apathetics last night to
clinch the title in that league.

Tournament Near

With the close of the regular
season, the Commissioners’ Tour—
nament is the nextscheduledAMlA
basketball event. The Tournament
will begin sometime next week and
will be completed no later than
March 3.

Commissioner Jerry Blair has
called a meeting for 1:00 pm.

today at which the. Tournament
will be discussed. Captains of

each team in the first three

leagues. plus the One-Eyes. must
attend.

ment.

Season’s Record Stands at 4—5;

by Dick Pavlis

In action Tuesday, State’s wrestlers broke out of
their three match losing streak by defeating R.P.l.‘by
the score of 21-3; bringing their season’s record to 4
wins and 5 loses.

Gene Monaco ran his winning streak to 9 by gaining
a default win in the opening match, as State took a 5—0
lead. Albany then ran its lead to 8—0 as Lee Comeau
returned to action with a 4—2 decision. R.l’.l. then
narrowed the lead to 8-5, as Ron Kent was pinned.

The Albany grapplers then broke open the close
match by winning three of the next four weight classes
and drawing the other. Dick Kalfis upped the State
lead to 11—5 by taking a 5—3 decision and then John
Bennett lengthened the lead by winning on another
decision by the score of 5—3, making the score 14—5.

John \Voytowich, who continues to wrestle seem—
ineg nothing but close matches, then drew with his
opponent 5-5, making the score 16—7. Dick Board
then won State’s last match of the day as be pinned
his opponent in the second period, running the score
to 21—7. R.P.l. ended the match by winning the fiscal
heavyweight bout on a pin.

Drop Match

Last Saturday Albany State’s wrestlers traveled to
Oswego and came out on the short end of a 34-3 score.
The match, however, did produce one bright spot for
the Albany matmen as (lenc Monaco continued his un—
defeated streak.

The match opened with Albany getting off to a 3—0
lead, as Gene Monaco (123 pounds) took his eighth
straight Victory by a 5-2 decision; however, this was
to be the only Ped victory of the day.

With Lee Comeau still out with an injury, State
forfeited the 130 pound class, giving Oswego a 5—3
lead. From there, Albany’s fortunes fell as Ron Kent
(137 pounds) and Dick Kalfas (147 pounds) both lost
by decision, and John Rennott (157 pounds) was pinned.

The injury bugaboo then struck the team again as
Co—Captain, John \\’oytowich (167 pounds) was injured
in his match and State had to default the, woight class.

Frosh Trompled

The freshman wrestlers saw their’s season’s rec-
ord slip to 3 wins and :3 losses as they dropped their
last two matches to tho ()swego and the ll.P.l. fresh—
man teams. in both of tho matches the frosh wrestlers
could take only one victory. in the match with ()swcgo
JOhn Robb (177 pounds) won on a pin and the match
with R.l).i., the team’s only victory was picked up
I)}’ Rob Verigiii (l37) by a 5—4 decision. Verigni also
still continues to show the host record on the team
— 5 wins and 2 losses.

and dropped another heartbreaken.
On Feb. 13 the Sauersmen took on
Oneonta State and easily downed
the Dragons 69—51. The visitors
had topped Albany earlier in the
year 40—39.

Paced by (To—captains Don De—
Luca and Jim Oppedisano the 10-
cals broke in front and easedtheir
way to a 37-25 halftime lead. The
marvelous Albany defense held the
Dragons to only 3 field goals in
the first half.

After intermission, the squad
picked up where it left off and led
by Oppedisano and Dan 7.eh, com—
pleted the romp.

Three men hit double figuresfor
Albany as Uppedisano hit for 21
points while l)eLuca had 1?. and
Ray \\'eeks added 10. Tom Nuttall
led (niconta with 17 while Joe
llcissan had ll.

Edged by Hawks

On Friday night the team found
.ie going a little rougher and took
it on the chin from the Hawks of
New i’altz by a score of 61-59.
it was the fifth time this year that
the team has been beaten by two
points or loss.

Paced by newcomer Fred Sadler,
who became oligible for the first
time this semester, the Hawks
played a cool steady brand of ball.
The first half was close to the vest
as the Feds found themselves on top
by a 33-31 margin.

Sadler, who had 11 points in the
first half, and Bob Dillman who had
7 continued to plague Albany in the
second half. With less than 30
seconds remaining in the game a
clutch Albany basket tied the score
59-59 but once again Sadler was
there to haunt the Sauersmen.

He came down court and put up
a long jump shot which swisbed
through the nets with 15 seconds
left to play in the game.

Then, with only 3 seconds left
to play, Joe Laiidis of Albany was

fouled and given 2 free throws.
After missing the first, Laudis

deliberately missed the second,
got the rebound, put up a jump
shot which rimmed around the
basket and went out as the. buzzer
Sounded.

Ray \\'eeks. who has become a
much steadier ball player, paced
thi- Purple and Gold with 19 points
while tippcdisano added 17. Fred
Siidlcr and llob Dillman were the
big llll‘ll for New l’nltz with ‘23
and 12 points rcspectivelv.

Blast Brockpon

The Saturday night victory was
particularly sweet for the team
as they iiizinngcd to beat their old
iicmesis from lirockport State by
a 72—61 riiai'gin.

The trend of the gamr- turned
to ii runaway curly as lllt‘ Peds
took advantage of numerous tingle
iiiislnkcs and raced to a AIS-‘35
half-time advantage. Weeks. Up—

uwrc fllt‘ big guns in thc first half
for lllt‘ lt‘dlll :is they shot the l’eds
to tho curly lczid which Hrockport
found lllljhihslllli‘ to overcome.

llll‘ rest of tho game was rupe—
Iilioii of tho first half as Illt‘ l‘eds
di-ti-usc kept the tingle offense
tlustcrcd and they missed a great
Illlllllli‘l' of easy shots.

The Albanians substitutedfreely
and liroi'kport began to catch up.
The halftime load proved to be. too
great zi hurdle and tho hoiiietowners
walked off with their llth victory
of the season and their (ith in the
last 8 games.

Dick t‘i‘ossett, whose knee is
preventing him from playing up to

and hauled down a good number of
rebounds, (bipedisanohad16,l’aul
