THE CURSE OF THE CAMPUS: NO. 2

 As was pointed out last week, one would think that with all
the progress we have made in the education game, something
might have been done by now about roommates. But no. The
roommate picture has not brightened one bit since Ethan
i Goodpimple founded the ﬁrst American college.

 (Contrary to popular belief, Harvard was not the ﬁrst. Mr.
Goodpimple started his institution some 75 years earlier. And
quite an institution it was, let me tell you! Mr. Goodpimpie
built schools of liberal arts, ﬁne arts, dentistry, and tanning.
He built a lacrosse stadium that seated 102,000. Everywhere
on campus was emblazoned the stirring Latin motto CAVE
MUSSI—“Watcli out for moose." The student union contained
a bowling alley, a clock, and a Ill—chair barber shop.

(It was this last feature “the barber shop~that, alas,
brought Mr. (loodpimple’s college to an early end. The student
body, being drawn from the nearby countryside, was composed
chiefly of “ecuets and Iroquois who, alas, had no need of a
barber shop. They braid their hair instead of cutting it, and as
for shaving, they don't. The barber, Treiiiblatt Follicle by name,
grew so depressed staring all the time at lli empty chairs that.
one day his mind finally gave way. Seizing his vibrator, he ran
outside and shook the entire campus till it crumbled to dust.
This later became known as I’ickett's Charge.)

But I digress. We were discussing ways for you and your
roommate to stop hating each other. This is admittedly difﬁ-
cult but not impossible if you will both bend a bit, give little.

I remember, for example, my own college days (Iieriitz, '08).
My roommate was, I think you will allow, even less agreeable
than most. lie was a Tibetan named Iiingailing whose native
customs, while indisputably colorful, were not entirely endear-
ing. .\iark you, I didn't mind so much the gong he struck on
the hour or the string of firecrackers he set off on the half-hour.
I didn’t even mind his siiigcing chicken feathers every dusk and
daybreak. What I did mind was that he singed iiilt'llliill my hat.

. To be fair, he was not totally lakcii with some of my habits
ether especially my hobby of collecting water. I had no jars
at the time and just bail to stack the water aiiy—old-whcre.

\iell sir, things grew steadily cooler between ltingading and
me, and they might have gotten actually ueg il:i(i we not each

Reorganization Committee Suggests
Bioameral legislature, lither Changes

The Government Reorganization
Committee, a standing committee
of Student Senate. was formed in

February 1962 with the purpose of

reorganizing our present Student
Government into a new and more
expanded form.

Prepare for Move

In a few short years, State Uni—
versity will be moving to a new
campus where, with a bigger cam-
pus and a larger student body, the
demands of students, individually
and en masse, will be augmented
tremendously in relation to those
present.

It is the expressed job of this
committee to foresee these nec—
essary changes and to formulate
an effective and workable plan of
government for use on the new
campus.

The committee is composed of
Pat Cerra ’64. Chairman; Mary
Margaret Welker ’65, Secretary;
Candy DalPan ’63: Marlee Soren—
son ’64; Art Johnson '65: George
Lomaga ’65; Harold Hansen ’63;
and Mr. William McKinnon, Stu-
dent Union Director.

The plan that has evolved through
the committee’s work is one that
is essentially bicameral in nature
in that the legislative branch will

consist of two houses, a Senate
and Assembly.

The executive department will
consist of a President, a First
and Second Vice—President, a
Treasurer, and a Board of Ad—
visors.

President's Duties Same

The duties of the President will
be similar in nature to those under
the present system. There will be
a co—ordination of the legislative
and executive departments, where
the President heads the executive
and the First and Second Vice—
Presidents head the main legisla—
tive bodies, the Senate and As—
sembly.

The Treasurer, elected by the
student body, will co—ordinate all
financial matters and will serve
as a non-voting member of the
Senate and the Assembly.

There will be. a Board of Ad—
visers whose functions will be es—
sentially the same as that of the
Cabinet — to advise the President.
It will be composedofthe Firstand
Second Vice—Presidents. the heads
of the Assembly Councils, and
the Treasurer.

The Senate shall be. the policy
making body ofthe governnaarit, for

example, having the final say on
budgets. It will function in essen—
tially the same manner as it does
now.

New Representation

The new idea for Senate repre—
sentation will give each class a
basic number of Senators plus ad~
ditional Senators in proportion to
class numbers. In effect, this
wil reflect the true political and
tax—paying power of each class.

One of the main distinctions of

this new plan is the establishment
of an Assembly. Fundamentally,
its purpose is to deal effectively
with student activities.

The problem with budgets will
be solved by originating budgets
on the Assembly floor since the
Assembly has representation from
all budgetary organizations.

Also, all chartered organiza—
tions ofS./\. Shallhave representa—
tion in the Assembly through coun—
cils created by Senate for such
representation, such as IFC and
ISC.

The Assembly will co-ordinate
all educational, recreational. cul—
tural and social events; not as a
co-ordinalion and Communications
body between the various extra-
curricular activities on the cam—
pus. II will also organize and set
up the Social Calendar, as well as
originate budgets.

New Secretariat

.\lso newly created is the Sec-
retariat whose duties will be to
prepare and maintain accurate
records open for public review.

The Secretary of the. Senate, ap-
pointed by the President, shall be
the administrative officer of the
Secretariat and shall havo the
power to appoint the members of
the Secretariat staff.

The. Very citadel of tradition on
State campus (a campus where
tradition plays an expanded role)
is .\lYSIx’AMA. It will SI‘I‘VI‘ as
