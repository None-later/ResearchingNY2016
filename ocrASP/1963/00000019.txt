lay .l. A. Gertie:

Within the last few years. many
German novelists have examined
the effects of Hilter’s regime on
the everyday life of the common
citizen.

Heinrich Boll. senior memberof
the Group 47 literary movement.
has recently written a novel deal-
ing with this aspect. Complex in
style. theme. and attitude.
Billiards at Hell-Poet Nlrre presents
the reader with some notable.
but not insurmountable. difficul-
ties. The rewards for taking the
effort to overcome these complex-
ities is well worthwhile.

Novel Poorly Developed

The technical skill and mastery
of Boll comes to light when one
contrasts his hook with Albrecht
(Toes‘ The Burnt Offering. Goes
attempts to draw a simple sketch
in black and white. He explores
the conscience of a woman who has
been chosen to sell meat to the
Jews.

On the whole. his developmentof
the novel is poor. There is little
character development. and some
situations seem quite contrived.
The symbolism. in contrast to
Boll's subtle complexities. is ov-
erly obvious. All the Hebrews
are Davids. and all the Nazis are

Goliaths. Even the Rabbi looks
like an Old Testament prophet.

Although the actual action takes
place on September 6. 1958. time
is forever shifting from past to
present. Through reveries and a
Faulkner-like stream of consci-
ousness. characters present dif-
ferent views and reactions to the
situations of the past.

Rellgleue Imagery

Often their accounts are filled
with obvious and subtle symbolism.
Biblical and religiousimagery also
plays a major role in the book.

The central figure is Robert
Feahmel. son of a famous archi—
tect who built St. Anthony's Abbey.
As a student. Robert and his
friends fail to adhere to the totali-
tarian doctrines of the thirties.
They refuse the “Host of the
Beast." After he returns from
forced exile. Robert becomes a
demolition expert for the Nazis.

Unlike his father. the creative
destroyer. Robe rt is the destroying
creator. Allthroughhisactivities.
Robert has only one goal in mind.
He wishes to destroy St. .\nthony‘s
Abbey.

Gete Chance
He gets his chance a few days
before the end of the war. “He
had wanted to erect a monument
of dust and rubber for those who had
not historical monuments and
whom no one had thought to spa re."
Robert is not moved by “some

Discussion Outlines Possible
Transition From College to

The panel discussion “College
to University. Are State Students
Up to the Challenge." which was
held on Tuesday night under the
sponsorship of the Campus Chris-
tian Council outlined some basic
problems of transition and af—
firmed possible plans of action.

Moderated by Campus Minister
Frank Snow. the panel of Dean
David Hartley. Dr. Paul “heeler
of the Sociology Department. Carl
Schraeder ‘63, Mrs. Marilyn \\'ienk
‘64. and John Tyo ‘64. attempted to
analyze current campus trouble
spots and to anticipate some which
may arise.

honor of his ancestors. He is
concerned with human beings-—
Ferdi. Edith. the messenger boy.
the waiter. These are the ones who
ate “Host of the Lamb” and paid
for it with their lives.

Like Robert. Schrella will not
forget these people. Like Robert,
he must always remain an alien
in the society around him. He
shows no mercy and no forgive-
ness. “We‘re not God and can't
any more measure up to His mercy
than to His omniscience."

Mother Goes Insane

Robert's mother seesherbroth—
er. her son. and her entire way of
life destroyed. She can stand it no
longer: she rebels against her
condition. “Notyrannicideforme.
it‘ll be murder of respectability.”

She refuses to accept any more
favors from the “Host of the
Beast." She vainly attempts to
arouse her insensitive neighbors.
Finally. she is hauled offtoa mad—
house.

Boll is a sharp critic of both the
past and the present. In many ways.
the materialistic concerns of
present societies are similar to
those of past groups.

This cyclical process appears
in the attitudes ofthe three genera—
tions of this century. The only
difference is that now :i more “bit-
ter fate" is invokcd, “the .ttom‘ll

Baker Suggests New Plan
For Fraternity Rushing
During Third Semester

by Ctr-lie Idiot

The longer we remain on this
campus the more we question the
correctness of the present fra-
ternity rushing and pledgingtimes.
Most intelligent upperclass men
realize the tremendous strain un-
dergone by freshmen in their initial
adjustment to the college environ-
ment. First there is Frosh Week:
then Rivalry. which only vaguely
realizes its goals but takes a lot
of time: and then the lFC Smoker
with open season declared on frosh
men. A flurry of concerted effort
is made by fraternities and about
half or two-thirds ofthe freshmen:
the ﬂurry continues through the
busy holidays and final exams and
reaches a crescendo a week before
the issuance of bids.

Unfortunately many ofthose men
scheduled to receive bids are not
to be found — somethingabout final
grades. And there are others who
are unquestionably goingtobe sub-
merged by the ever-rislng tide of
academic demands (first semester
only required 16 hours of C; with
a 1.0 plus average. second semes~
ter demands 6-16 hours of B). but
social demands are still pressing
and the freshmen accept a bid
anyway: who knows. this may be
their last few months in college.

Next come six “uneventful”
weeks of pledge education. The
pledge has certain smallduties and
chores to perform. these generally
of a ratherdiversified and possibly
time-consuming nature. Then
comes “Hellp Week" and finally
initiation.

Now back to our studies -— BUT
\\ .\IT! We forgot we have fraterni—
ty elections. and we do have to as—
similate these men. get them im-
mersed in fraternity activity. and
help them to adjust to “real” fra-
ternity life. “hen this assimila-
tion is completed, so are June
finals.

Fraternities may facilitate so-
cial adjustment. but undoubtedly

they hinder academic adjustment
and improvement. It is simple
logic to see that when a person's
attention is concentrated on one
objective. other objectives suffer
accordingly.

Third semester rushing is our
solution. During the summer.
fraternity men would undergo a
real test of their social polar: and
manners. They would go out and
meet the rushees' parents as well
as the rushees and sell them on

Circumstances Prove

Governor A Culprit

To the Edlter:

I was very impressed with Gary
Luczak’s rebuttal in the February
22nd issue of the News to Ginny
Morgan’s article of the previous
week. I frankly had hoped someone
would set Ginny straight in regard
to her assertions that tuition will
be used for improvements within
the State University system, and
that it “will not go to pay for any-
one‘s over-expenditures." Even
though the Board of Trustees has
stated tuition for such advance-
ment of the State University. Ginny
Morgan wo‘uld have to he clair-
voyant to forecast them with such
invariable uncertainty.

But Gary Luczak. as I was de-
ed to observe. went even further
than this. The approach he used
for his reply to Ginny's argument
was a sort of reasoning by anal—
ogy. for which Gary is indeed to
be commended. lie skillfully
avoided direct concentration on

Governor Rockefeller's role in re-
gard to tuition itself. and be pro-
ceeded to indict the Governor for
mal intent with tuition on the basis
of all the other areas of the Gov-
ernor’s dealings. Gary's conclu-
sions. on this basis. that the Gov-
ernor is a “two-timinghypocrite"
and an “irresponsible political
opportunist" are an excellent
means by which to develop this
correspondence. and l amenthusi-
astically in favor of this.

i would therefore like to take
this opportunity. in the interest of
the public good. to urge that the
idea of “innocent until proven
guilty" be done away with and that
“guilt by association and specula-
tion" be put in its place. Cir-
cumstantial evidence would cer—
tainly simplify matters inbringing
culprits like Governor Rockefeller
to justice.

Observer Offers
New Response

To the Edltor:

I am deeply impressed with the
eloquence of the daily conversa—
tion of certain groups of young
ladies on this campus. 1 shall now
quote:

“Hi. how are you""

“l‘m fine! flow are you""

“I'm fine! How are you"" . ..

This could go on until all mem—
bch were stricken with laryngitis
and often does with larger groups.
it is nice to know that these
“CAMPUS QUEENS" are all in
such good health. i would like to
purpose a new greeting. which I
feel would be more appropriate:

“Row—Wow“ "How-Wow"

“.\rf-.\rf" “Bow—Wow" .

Sudenl Says Voting

Procedures Are Lax

To the Editor:

By the time this letter is pub-
l‘shed, the elections will be over
and the ballots counted. ldo not
’eel that it is too late. however.
to point out some laxities in the
conducting of this year's elec—
tions:

(1) there was insufficient con-
(.‘crn over the whereabouts of the
ballots.

(2) there was no identification
required for voting, and

(3) there was no adequate con-
trol to prevent someone from vot-
ing more than once.

On Saturday morning (Feb. 23).
i found over 350 ballots for S. A.

PAGE 5

 

President and Vice President and
similar number of Myskanla bal-
lots carelessly thrown in the trash
in Waterbury Hall. These ballots
were not voided in any way and
hence were available on the second
day of the elections for ballot-box
stuffing.

I set out to prove on Monday that
some of these ballots could he
slipped into the ballot—box by var-
ious methods. Those were the bal—
lots on which “J.F.K.." and “Al
Newman" and “Thirteen ‘Frisky
Miskies'” were written in candi—
dates. Did the election officials
wonder where they came from?l
am convinced that I could actually
have voted on these ballots with-
out detection.

My second objection. that no
identification was required for vot—
ing. is not a trivial point. On
Monday afternoon. I was actually
able to obtain ballots using some-
one else's name (with his permis-
sion).

Then under the watchful eyes
of the election officials. I gave
these still-unmarked ballots to
their rightful owner (in class of
‘65) and submitted some of my
specially—marked ballots (green)
to the same official who gave me
p_iri_kones.

Isn’t it obvious that anyone would
be able to vote more than once.
just by using various names?

This is related to my third point
that there were no adequate con—
trols to prevent someone casting
more than one ballot. since the
officials allowed the voter to pick
up his own ballot. This l also
proved to my satisfaction on Mon—
day. as l walked straight into the
voting room and gave my specially-
marked ballots to the officials who
accepted them without question.

i wish to emphasize that my
actions did iﬂ affect the results
of the elections because my ballots
were not properly marked. But I
believe that, in a close election,
a few people using the techniques
which I employed could swing the
elections.

i ll() not wish to give the im-
pression that this year's election
r-oiiiiiiission was any more lax than

thosu of the past. I do. however.
