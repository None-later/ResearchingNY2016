ANNUAL AMIA OAOE TOURNAMENT

The AMIA basketball Commis—
sioners Tournament came to a
close last Wednesday with Potter

The game was played too late to
make press time, but the outcome
mattered little as the first and
second league Potter teams were
the only ones to make the finals.

This was a big year for the men
in Black and White as they came
up league champions in all four
A MIA basketball loops. With a 1-2
finish assured in the Tournament.
their domination is further under-
scored.

A total of twelve teams were

Spinning the
Sports Wheel

by Bill Colgan

 

While wasting time watching “Weirdo Night” (that’s
re—runs of" old horror movies that are even more un—
believable than Ed 21) last Thursday night, a great
metaphysical experience overwhelmed this humble
warlock. Yes, terrified sports fan, you have read
correctly! At long last we of the sports—editing pro—
fession have seen fit to reveal our long-kept secret.

It seems, sports fans, that all sports-editors are
descended from warlocks, having at their command use
of the Dark Powers. Fortunately, by definition, sports—
editors are “good guys” who rarely exercise the forces
of the Underworld. Instead, we regulate ourselves to
making harmless predictions (which, of course, are
never wrong) and the like. But hold, we digress.

Back to that metaphysical experience! While sitting
in front of the television, a sudden blaze of light filled
the room. Some clod had turned on the light. But a
great revelation occurred along with this blaze of
light. And we feel compelled, yes compelled, to make
a PREDICTION!

It seems State’s basketballers are engagedina slight—
ly important tournament down Cortland way this week—
end. And while the Sauersmen have lost five games
(by a total of 11 points, we might add) to the teams
entered in said tournament, we have it on good author—
ity that the Feds will beatthe devil (Sorry, chief. We’ll
watch the language) out of their opponents.

The Sauersmen are seeded sixth, and will get to
annihilate their old playmates from Oswego in the first
round. No trouble there. The Feds will take it by
ten. Then comes a change of pace as State takes on
the nation’s number two small~college defensive team,
Potsdam. Here too, we see no problem. State lost to
this ball club by one point on a fluke earlier in the
season. No fluke this time. State in a walk by five.

And so fans we come to the great climax of our od—
yessey. State vs. Cortland in the game of the year.
The majority of knowledgeable sports fans will put
their coin on Cortland. But they operate on earthly
knowledge. We know all. State will take Cortland by
five, or we’ll be (Oh no! We didn’t mean itchicf.
Ouch, those brimestones are hot...)

As Monaco Suticrs First Defeat;

State’s varsity wrestling team competed in the third
annual New York State Intercollegiate Wrestling Tourna-
ment last week at ()swcgo, but could manage to take
only two seconds and a third in the individual matches.
The l’eds finished last in the Tournament with 26
points.

The Tournament was won by highly regarded Cort—
land with 87 points, while ()swego finished second
with 85, and Brockport and ()neonta tied for third
with 33 points apiece.

State’s two second placos were taken by Gene Mon—
aco (123 lb.) and Dick Board (177 lb.) and the third
went to Dick Itobelotto (heavyweight).

Monaco Suffers Disappointment

State received a rough break in the 123 lb. class as
(lene Monaco, who went into the Tournament with a
9—0 record, was defeated in overtime. in the, finals of
a disputed match. Monaco had taken his first bout of
the meet on a fall.

In the finals Monaco and Pete I.aMonica of ()swcgo
finished the regulation period tied up at 5-5. In the
ovortime period, I.aMonica reversed Monaco for two
points. Monaco came fighting back, however, to tally
one point on an escape. This made the score, 2—l.

Thursday night’s game was a
horror show for the tearr as they
took it on the chin from the Bomb~
ers of Ithaca College. The team
could do nothing right against the
taller opponents and threw the ball
away numerous times.

The usually adequate defense fell
apart and allowed the most points
that any team has scored against
them this year.

The team found itself trailingby
a 45-27 margin at halftime which
eventually proved to be insur-
mountable. Bill Schutz, Ron Fazio.
and George Strickland were the
thorns in the side of.\lbany as they
scored many times and accounted
for a grand total of 60 points for
the winners.

.\lbany began to catch up with
about 6 minutes left but the first
team for Ithaca reentered and the
game was put out of reach.
Oppedisano with 18 and Crossett
with 14 were the big guns in the
attack for the Purple and Gold.

to go to Cortlaan tonightortomor—
