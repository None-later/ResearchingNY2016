The experience that makes the deepest difference in
any person is the experience of going to college. It is
here that the man, the woman, is created; for it is
here that thinking begins, and in our society there is
no more noticeable difference that the difference be—
tween the thoughtful and the unthoughtful person.

Perhaps nothing does more to intensify this exper-
ience than the reading of books. Why is this so? The
answer lies in the potential that the reading of books
offers for developing the processes of thought, in the
college student who has taken the most advantage of
this potential in his years at college.

Books stretch the mind—the most elastic thing a

human being possesses.

The student who forms the

habit of letting this experience happen to him should
never lose it, though he will probably exercise it less

in later years.

In college he is expected to read

books; to take in the whole ofa long argument or ex—
position or narrative; to keep the parts of it before
him as he reads, and to see them in their natural
relation; to live with an author for hours or days or
weeks, to venture through new worlds as if he had a

right to be there.

The world of a college is many worlds, all of
which will be new to the freshman, varied and ever
changing to the upperclassman. His passport through
these worlds is his desire and his ability to read. He
will come back from his intellectual journeys in col—
lege a richer person than the one who went.

He will have attended classes and listened to lec—
tures, and participated in discussions. These are es—
sential to the college experience; yet the reading of
books is just as important. And its peculiar feature
is that it is done alone, at night or at strange hours,
when the student is his own master, bent upon cul—
tivating the mind that is uniquely his.

This mind of his is, of course, engaged in a rivalry
with other minds; for a college has many good minds;
students are competitors as well as peers. But no
form of competition is more genial; it is a race for

intellectual
triumph.

satisfaction and

happiness, not mere

The habit of reading books is the clearest indication
of an educated person, whether in or out of college.
But it starts in college, for any studentwho is genuinely

there.

The good reader not only uses his mindin

reading, he develops it. Nothing is more rewarding
than the first of these; nothingis nobler than the second.

BY WAY OF COMMENT

Governor Rocketeller’s 'Pay-As-Iou-Co’ System
To Collapse With Its ‘llay of Reckoning’

by Gary Leelek

In my column last week.you will
recall. I made referencetothe fact
that the consequences of Mr. Rock—
efeller's fiscal “shinanlgans.” asI
called them. could only be disas-
trous for him and for the people of
this state.

I would like atthlstime toexpand
briefly on this point.

First of all. let us take a con-
cise tour through the ruins of
“pay-as-you-go." I have already
mentioned two of our Governor’s
contrlvances for concealingdeficit
financing.

These are his depletion of the
Capital Construction Fund’s re-
serves and the pressuring ofvari-
ous public agencies to return tothe
state cash allotments granted to
them previously by the state.

Add to these the important de-
vice of moving up the payment
dates of every tax he possibly can.
such as the collecting of fourteen
months withholding taxes in twelve

months.
Tue Budget:

The last Is the extremely clever
scheme of eliminating from the
state budget various regular ex-
penditures that cannot be financed
except by borrowing(i.e. State Uni-
versity capital outlays) and, having
removed them. proclaiming that
he has balanced the budget.

Arthur Levitt. the State Comp-
troller. in referring to Mr. Rocke-
feller's shifty methods offinancing
state expenditures has said “...
we are using future revenue to
meet today’s costs———a procedure
which will have its day of reckon-
mg.”

This “day of reckoning" will
come with an outright increase in
state taxes. for this will be the
only alternative. His removal of
certain expenditures from the state
budget and his subsequent financing
of these by borrowing. plus his
depletion of the state’s cash re-
serves can have only one result—
a cash deficit.

smorgasbord dinner to be held
March 15.

Temporary Income

Add to this fact that the tax
collection advances and that the
repayment he expects from cer-
tain public authorities can only be
effective sources of revenue for
one or two years.

After that one or two years,
they will not be available. yet the
expenditures which they have sup-
ported will continue.

Consequently, funds in support
of these expenditures will have to
be raised by other means; since
our Governor has just about ex—
hausted his bag of tricks. he will
have to resort to a tax increase
if he is to maintain the myth of
“pay—as—you-go."

Bonds Available

I think that an important side—
light to the topic under discus—
sion should here be brought out.
In 1956 the legislature passed
and the people approved a $500
million bond issue which was to
help finance. among other things.
highway construction and expan—
sion of the State l‘niiicrsity.

To date. some $410 million worth
of these bonds remain unsold. 'l‘o
sell these bonds would be an out-
right violation ofthe “pay-as—yoii—
go" theory on which the Governor
has staked his political career.
(.\nd as we know, our Governor
tends to Shy away from such words
as “outright.”)

Controlled Borrowing

.\ctually. it has been stated bv

many, including Mr. Levitt. that
there is nothing wrong with a
limited amount of borrowing if

done prudently, it is worth noting
that this $410 million in unsold
bonds would have far exceeded the
various “fee” increases the Gov—
ernor had proposed.

i believe it was Louis XV who
said. “.\fter me, the deluge!" it
would seem to me that these words
could apply equallv as well to Mr.
Rockefeller.

He expects to be comfortably
situated in the “bite llouse when
the fiscal structure of this state
comes crumbling to the ground.

The question we must ask our
selves in 1964 is whether we want
to entrust our fate and the fate of
our country to a man who has
repeatedly violated the public
trust: can .'\Ir, Rockefeller cvcr
be trusted aguIn'.‘

Parking Rules
to Be Enforced

Beginning March 11, Campus
Commission will begin stricter
enforcement of the parking rules.
Warnings will be issued to those
students who do not comply with
the regulations.

As spring approaches. Campus
Commission is again going to en-
force parking rules. Regular daily
enforcement will start on Monday,
March 11. and warnings will be
issued for improper parking or
parking without a permit.

All warnings previously issued
will be discarded. Studentdrivers
are warned against parking so as
to block other cars or an exit or
entrance to the parking lot.

Warnings will be given for the
first and second offense. The
third offense and any following it
will be accompanied by a fine
against the student.

A limited number of parking
permits are now available in the
Student Personnel Office for those
students desiring one. A parking
permit does not assure anyone
of a place to park in the parking
lot: it merely gives a student
the right to park there.

Permits are to be put
