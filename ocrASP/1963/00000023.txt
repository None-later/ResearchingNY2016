Spinning the
Sports Wheel

by Bill Colgan

Now that all has been done and said about the State
Basketball Tournament, we can’t help but raise a
question which we are sure has been on the minds
of many State’s athletic fans. Why was the tourna-
ment held in Cortland, when it would have been much
better and much more logical to hold ithere in Albany?

A quick look at the merits of both towns leaves.
no doubt that all concerned would have been benefitted
by having the tournament here. When we speak of all
concerned, we mean not only the teams involved and
Albany, but Cortland also. Let us itemize.

(1) There can be very little comparison with the
respective basketball facilities at both colleges.
For, while the Cortland gym bears no resemblance to
our beloved Page, the Washington Armory offers ac-
commodations for nearly a thousand more people than
Cortland.

(2) The city of Albany offers far better housing
facilities for the teams and their followers than Cort-
land. At Cortland, the teams had to live in motels
and eat their meals in the college residence halls
several miles away. Many of the fans who poured
into the city didn’t even have motels to sleep in.

(3) And finally, the explosive nature of any such
tournament makes Albany a better choice. We will
not go into the unfortunate incidents at Cortland, but
will limit ourselves to saying that the heavy-drinking
fans who are drawn to these tournaments would be
spread out in a city the size of Albany. That this is
desirable cannot be denied, as proved by events.

Ken Outman had a 534 in support
of Roegner for the Unknowns. Arnie

In the Potter-Goober match, it
was the outstanding bowling of Al

Sabo had a fine 607 series on
games of 193, 215, and 199.

Al has been bowling steadily
all season. and this week he really
broke out with the big series.
Lilga also did some fine bowling
as he hit a 575 with a 235 single.
This is John’s second 230-plus
game of the season, having hit
another one the first week of the
season.

For the losing Goobers, Jim
Gittleman had high triple with a.

In the Waterbury—KB match Don
Hale led all bowlers as he hit a
fine 579 triple with a 207 single.
Other high triples were registered
by Wayne Van Pelt. 556. and Dick
Fairbank, 500. Tony Riservato led
the KB team with a 213—542 in a
losing effort.

APA Blasts
Handicapped

The dark horse second league.

features a closer race than its
big brother.

With three weeks remaining in
the bowling season, APA is leading
the league with a 28 - 12 record.
Not far off the pace are the Kobras
with a 26 — 14 tally. and in a Close
third are the Bombers with a 28 —
16 record.

The difference in total games is
due to the fact that there are five
teams in the league, thus causing
each team to have a “bye” per
rotation.

Individually. Marshall and Mor-
gan lead the league with 159 and
158 averages respectively. Kemp
and Little range high inthe singles
department with 230 and 226 sin—
gles. High triples belong to Little
(558) and VanEpps (550). The high—
team triple belongs to the Kobrns
with a 2673 series.

SAUERSMEN "CINDERELLA" TEAM AT STATE TOURNAMENT

 

Pod Grunt & Groaners Drop Finale

lo Hobart College Matmon 23-13
Team Ends Season With Hi Record

Albany State’s wrestling team closed out its season
by dropping a 23-13 decision to Hobart College, the
loss giving the team a season record of four wins and

six losses.

The State matmen were hampered in this match by
the effects of injuries suffered last week before and

feit victory and ran the score to
18-5.

years by winning their final
matches. John won his match by a

Sixth-Seeded Peds Reach Finals
Before Bowing to Potsdam 49-40

by Gary Smith

ALMOST - BUT NOT QUITE. That
seems to he the story of the varsity bes-
kefboll five this year as they finished
second in the Cortland Tournament to end
their season. The Feds won 12 games
and lost ll during the regular season. 0f
the H games that the team lost 5 were
lost by 2 points or less.

Well, the team entered the Tourna-
ment with few, if any, people expecting
them to survive the first round against
second seeded Oswego. Not only did the
team finish off the Lake" but they beat
Buffalo State and got into the Finals be-
fore losing a heartbreak" to Potsdam
Stole. It's been that kind of a year!

When asked about the team's
season and performance at Cort—
land, Saucrs said,“The rebounding
of the team has improved steadily
throughout the second half of the
season. This was in evidence in
the first two games of the Tourna—
ment against Oswego and Buffalo
when we. completely controlled the
boards. I was not surprised about
our two opening victories because
i have felt all year long that we
had a better club than most that
we played. The competition is
getting tougher all the time.”

When asked about next year
the coach said that we hoped the
team could return to Cortland to
participate in the affair if the
college doesn’t go through with
plans to take. Albany out of the
Conference. He said that things
would be much brighter for next
year if some proposed graduates
of two year collegeswouldtransfe r
to Albany.

Peds Overwhelm
Oswego 65—53

Getting back to the Tournament.
the Peds faced the sameteam from
()swego that they had beatenaweek
before by a 75—63 count. The game
was no picnic as the Peds found
themselves trailing at halftime by
a 33-26 margin.

The Sauersmen, who have fought
back all season long. made no ex—
ception hcrc as they reversed the
trciid of play thc first halfand took
the lead through fine dei'cnsv illltl
hustle.

.\t one point in the second half,
the I’eds run off a streak of 10

straight points while holding the
Lakers in check.

Peds Romp

It soon became evident that Al-
bany was an inspired team and
that they were on their way to
an opening round win in the tour-
ney. As it turned out. the squad
won by the same margin it had
a week ago, this time scoring 10
points less and triumphing 65—53.

This was an important victory
for the team because they soon
learned that they would not have
to face the first seeded team of
thc Tourney, Cortland. who had
been knocked off by New Paltz
earlier 60-59.

The big men for Albany were
()ppcdisnno and DeLuca who scored
17 and 15 points respectively. Dick
(‘rossett also netted 15 and hauled
down 20 rebounds for the winners.
Congilaro with 14 and Kowaiski
with 13 paced the Lakers.

iii-bounding like demons and
showing plenty of hustleanddeier-

buigc. The shooters were hot and
Duffqu couldn’t cope with the ten—
acious defense.

The second lliill found Buffalo
trying to ovcrcome the insur-
mountable I’cd loud as the team
continued hot and wouldn‘t be de—
nied the right to play in the cham-
pionship game.

Uppedisano. who has played
great ball the second half of the
season, was high man for Albany
with a 20 point performance.
('rosscil. Soph sensation, poured

liilfll‘il 12 each to the winning
cause.

Crossett, DeLuca. and Oppedi-
sano were known as the "Big
Three” in the Cortland papers as
Albany entered the final game
against Potsdam. Banaszak paced
the Orangemen with 21 points.

Potsdam Rips
State 49-40

The championship game. which
was witnessed by all too few Al-
bany students proved to be one of
frustration and dissapointment for
the team.

The whole affair started offwell
enough as deI.uca hit on two quick
jumpers to give the team a 4—0
lead. Potsdam was to have none
of this and they proceeded to
rattle off nine straight points for
a 9-4 lead.

Uphill Bettie

From there on in it proved
to be an uphill struggle for .\l—
bany as they found themselves
trailing at halftime by a score
of 25—18.

Albany was not to give up so
easy. however. The team came
back on the court after inter-
mission and staged a rally of the
first order, scoring 8 straight
points to take a 26—25 lead with
14:50 to go in the game.

This was the last time that the
team was to lead. as Hal Miller.
the Most Valuable Player of the
tourney. lead his team to a 6
point spread with about 8 minutes
to go in the game.

The losers were forced to go
into a press. The Potsdamoffense
remained calm and unflustered
and. as a result, Albany was forced
to foul Potsdam. This proved to
be disastrous as Potsdam was
deadly from the line

Miller Outstanding

Hall Miller, a tremendous ball-
player paced his team with 16
points while Ron Dinehart, who
along with Miller was named to
the First xlll Tourney Team had
12. Potsdam won itslasl 16 games
of the season.

()ppcdisnno and DeLuca playing
their last game for .\lbanv Shite
had 9 and a for the losers. The
team finished with a combined
14-12 record for [N year.
