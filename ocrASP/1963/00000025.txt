llc Plastic tor Puddle

The giant size puddle which is now on Dorm Field
has been the subject of a good deal of jest. We do not
consider the existance of this puddle a very amusing
occurance.

Last year’s Senate discussed the possibility of
purchasing a plastic liner. This would have been
used to protect the ground under the ice and to con—
fine the ice to set limits.

The difference between the system hoped for by
Senate and the system foisted upon them is shown by
the condition of Dorm Field. This muddy and slimy
condition will last for several months. Consider if
you will that the ice is or was4 feet thick in the middle
of the field.

It will be quite late in the school year before any
sun bathing will be done. This will be a long time
after the weather is warm enough for such activities.

Perhaps this year our Student Senate will show more
mature judgement of the people who “help” them in
ail the highly complex things that they can not do all
a one.

llriler Marks New Senate

“Well began is half done." This saying is apparent—
ly the philosophy of the new Student Association Presi—
dent, Pat Cerra.

We commend most highly his appointment of John
Sturtevant as Parliamentarian. We commend Senate
for approving the appointment.

John Sturtevant showed his ability at the very first
meeting, For the first time in quite a while Roberts
would stand a chance of recognizing his rules.

It should not take the members of Senate more than
two or three weeks to learn parliamentary procedure
with someone as competent as Sturtevant doing the
teaching.

till, Fraternities Act

The News would like to commend the inter—Fraternity
Council and the fraternities concerned on their quick,
decisive and positive actions in regard to the recent
events at the Cortland Tourney. in fairness to all in—
volved parties we are refraining from printing any
specific information at this time, but we do hope to
have a complete account in the next edition.

We would also like to make some further comment
on the spirit that seems to be engendered as a result
of this unforunate incident. For a long time there has
existed in the fraternities an element that felt dis—
satisfied with the function of the fraternities. Recently
these people, predominately fraternity and campus
leaders, have been examining the role of fraternities
and particularly their place or lack of it on the new
campus.

Cortland has succeeded in arousing almost everyone,
down to the lowly pledge, to a sharp awareness (Trif—
dividual and group standards. Fraternity men have
become tremendously aware of their failings and their
unrealized potentials. With this attitude, and action to
back it up, fraternities have a much better chance of
finding a place for themselves on the “West Campus.”

Commissioner Explains
Election Difficulties

To the Editor:

in reply to Mr. Matthew's latter
of March 1. we would like to offer
an explanation. not an excuse. for
his accusations.

The ballots which were found in
the trash basketof Waterbury Hall.
were of no use, since they were
not printed in alphabetical order.
as were the ones used in the elec-
tion.

The ballots were not checked
when handed to us: but they war};
spotted while being counted. be-
cause of the lack of alphabetical
order, and not your “J.F.K." ad-
ditions. We will concede the fact
that you did try to cleverly (and
matureiy) outwit the eiectioncom—
mission.

There are over three thousand
members of Student Association,
each of which is entitled to cast
a vote in the elections. We can-
not pretend to know everyone. nor
have we proclaimed to be masters
of this impossible feat.

There are loopholes in any sys-
tem and we confess that we have
ours. Any dishonest student can
vote more than once by using
another student's name. in the
past. we have trusted that our
student body would not pull this
lowest of crimes. but apparently
our trust was not realistic.

By using student tax cards, we
will not eliminate this problem.
because students can still borrow
someone else's student card and
vote more than once. Our rec-
ommendation is that Senate use
tax cards with the student's pic-
ture on it, so we would have a
closer check on the dishonest stu-
dents.

Voting machines are feasible for
SA. President, Vice Presidentand
class officers, but thee are no
voting machines made which can
accommodate MYSKANM andSen-
ate ballots.

We admit our fault in allowing
the students to pick up their own
ballots. Once again, you have des-
troyed our trust in the student body.
it seems that now we a re expected
to assume the role of “guardian of
the student body." We will, how—
ever, pass out the ballots infuture
elections.

if you are interested in helping
us correct our errors, Wt‘ would
appreciate your contacting us.

Letter to the Editor:

Until a girl is 15—16,she must
fight for twelve o‘clock curfew
hours: however, why when she is
eighteen, nineteen, or even twenty
must she still fight'.’ .\s we all
know freshman girls at State must
bear the humiliation of returning
from a date at this incredible hour
— twelve o’clock.

“but are the consequences of
being late’.’ First, let me explain
that freshman is given a fifty—
nine second leeway. .v\ftcr this
time she is gromch By this i
mean that after coming in no later
than three minutes past the allot-
ted time the freshman gets one
warning: anytime between fourand
twenty minutes merits two warn-
ings: beyond that — forget it!

The rules forextendcd hours are
much more lenient — supposedly.
For example. if arty girl is granted
three o'clock hours and returns
one second past the hour she is
considered not just one second
late, but three hours and one
second late, tier punishment could
include anything from one week—
end campus to two months campus.

This rigid curfew is disliked by
most many reasons.
i-Iveryone knows that a party, es—
pecially an it.i‘.l. party, does not
start to swing until 11:30; that is
just the time that a State girl must

lliouglits tin War And Peace

by Gary Lucsok

i would like to digress this
week from my usual formatof cur-
rent political commentary and of-
fer instead a few reflections i had
upon seeing Darryl F. Zanuck's
production of'i‘heLongestDay.

Let me say that i do not pre-
sume to judge on the artistic
merits of this picture: this task
i will leave in the much more
competent hands of the reviewers.
i sat and i watched. And for three
hours and some odd minutes i
witnessed the most authentic re-
enactment of that hideous night-
mare known as D—Day that has
ever been attempted.

Monumental Production

Certainly the time, effort, and
cost of such a monumental pro-
duction as this ranks it as one
of the mostombitious undertakings
in the annuals of the motion pic-
ture industry. i am thus forced
to wonder if Mr. Zanuck had any
deep, underlying motive in mind
when he decided to take on this
colossal venture other than the
desire to reap a sizeable mon-
tary return.

This is debatable. but i myself
thought it served adefinite subsid-
iary purpose: itvividlyand realis-
tically portrayed what senseless
slaughter of millions of individuals
(both the guilty and the innocent)
war involves and showed that in
the end it settles nothing — ab—
solutely nothing.

if one person leaving the theatre
found himself asking “Why?;” if
one person found himself with a
renewed determination to prevent
such a holocaust from ever engulf-
ing and permanently scaringfuture
generations as it has our own; if
one person decided to send a con-
tribution to CARE or to visit the
UN — then, Mr. Zanuck. then your
efforts will have served a purpose
for which you can be truly proud.

War, man's inhumanity to man.
has been employed as a most effec-
tive way of settling human differ—
ences an untold number of times
in the many centuries of recorded
history.

To Caesar and the Romans itwas
the most convenient and direct
method for increasing their power
and spreading their culture. in
modern times also we see appar-
ent justification for its usage.

War Necessary

in 1870, a war was necessary,
claimed Bismarck, to complete
the unification ofGermany; in 1914.
the Hapsburgs had to avenge the
death of a member of their family
and the French set out to regain
their lost prestige and to revive
their past glory; in 1939, Hiiter
was bent on righting the injustices
of the Versailles treaty and on
extending German dominion over
the civilized world.

But all that is past. That is
“dead history". We must now
re-appraise the present and look
ahead to the future. Never before
in the history of the human species
has man hadthe capabilityfor mass
destruction and complete annihila-
tion that he now possesses.

Pooco by Anton-ant

On the other hand, never before
has man had the potentiality for
settling his disputes amicably that
we now have in this much maligned
organization known as the United
Nations.

Man is supposed to be the most
advanced form ofiife on this planet;
i think that it is high time he
started acting like same. i must
state right here. however, that i
do not support the various “ban-
the-bomb" rabble-musing organ-
izations or the various “peace
groups" that have sprung up
throughout this hemisphere and in
Europe.

i hold that if the chosen leaders
of the peoples of the world can
not, on theirown initiative. sit down
and settle theirdifferences like the
sensible. intelligent, mature hu—
man beings they profess to be,
then the human species, like those
organisms that are unable to adapt
to new forces and changing con—
ditions, is destined for ultimate
extinction.
