MANY CAMPING OPPORTUNITIES

Camp Ready tor llse by Students and Faculty
Accommodations Available for thirty People

As of March 8, 1963. Camp Dip-
pikill has been opened for use by
students and faculty of State Uni-
versity at Albany and theirguests.

A group may sign up for use
of the camp for any weekend by
following the rules set up by the
Camp Board. Until warmer wea-
ther. however, there will be no ov—
ernight trips allowed because of
the lack of some necessary facili—
ties.

The camp, because of the work
done this past summer. can now
accommodate about 30 people.
This may be one large group or
two smaller ones. Each group will
be required to have one chaperone
for every 10 people if the group
is mixed.

if the group is composed of men
only. \\'omcn will he required to

Any group going to (‘amp [lip-

its own firewood, or to bring \\’00(I
with them. since there is still
snow on the ground at the camp.
.\ll groups should leave enough
chopped firewood so that the next
group can start a fire.

snow disappears, wood will hr- cut

alleviating this problem. NH liv~

l Communication I

To the Editor:

Please be informed that last
week’s installment of “Common-
Stater” misquoted a famous line
from Alexander Pope's poem,“An
Essay on Criticism." The“Com-
mon-Stater" version. “What has
oft been said. but ne'er so well
expressed." should have read,
“What oft was thought. but ne'er
so well expressed."

I realize that illiteracy was not
the most offensive aspect of last
week's “Common-Staten" but it
is nonetheless significant.

We Failed; Y

by Al Mlnarclh

The largest social problem fac-
ing the American people today is
the rejection of the Negro commun-
ity from all the activities of the
white majority. Although we can
be moved to righteous indignation,
we are rarely motivated to action.

While the Negro is a hundred
years out of slavery. he is still
in social servitude. He is being
subordinated by our views. our
stereotypes. our biases, and our
convictions.

We have no right to remain aloof
from this situation, since it is
our fault. We. the whites, are
responsible for the monumental
shame of our inability to accept
our Negro brother.

Colon of Dougrogatton

It is not necessary to recite
the milestones of desegregation.
The names of Brown vs. Topgka
Gov. Faubus. Little Rock. Ross
Barnett, James Merrdith. and
Oxford are Clearly emblazoned on
our minds. It is a painful sight
for us to witness students getting
a military escort to their classes.

Since we are northerners, we
tend to take a rather selfrighteous
attitude on the racial problem.
in the battle for equal rights, we
have to fully appreciate the role
of hatred on the battle ofthe Negro
for his constitutional rights.

Underlying Principle

America was shocked by the
bloody abuse heaped on the Federal
marshals andtroops in Mississippi
last September. The principle
underlying this was more than the
question of states‘ rights as op-
posed to Federal power. James
Meredith was not hated because
he was a student trying to enter a
university, but because he was a
Negro,

This was a sorry spectable ti
both the newly emerging nations
of the world and to ourselves.
it may be assessed not only as a
debacle for our democratic ideals
and values, but also as a great

The racial question has an odd
polarity. Around one pole the
lunatic fringe flock around the
White Ctttzena' Councils and at
the other pole we have Malcolm
X. and his Black Muslims. Both
alternatives offer a complete
breakdown of the American notion
of equality for all people.

In reality. both groups have
similar racial policies. Before
we pass moral judgements on
others, however. it would be wise
to evaluate our own stand on this
critical issue.

in no real sense to therelntegra-
tion at Albany State. Although
a handful of Negro students attend
our school, there is no clear indt-
cation that we have accepted the
principles of racial equality. In
fact, the Negro at State seems to
be treated as a curioustty piece
rather than a member of the Uni-
verity community.

Integration not Dougrogation
integration impliesthe harmonic
ous functioning of all facts of the
community. Desegregation istak-
ing place in many sections of our
country without any acceptance of
racial equality.

The college community at State
seems to he oblivious of some
major concr-rns that are close to
the campus. \\'e are ignorant of
the plight of the Negro in the
city of .\lbany. Dreadful slums
exist in the predominantly Negro

et We Remain Apathetic

recently said that the most con-
structive thing that the white man
could do about the Negro was to
weep.

As our society is now structured.
the Negro has no future. The
Black Muslim movement preaches
to the demoralized Negro and gives
him a sense of purpose.

This not the Negro of the three-
fifths compromise, of the Dread
Scott decision: he is no longer
Uncle Tom; but a person who has
a right to our respect.

The "New" Nogro

Yet he remains, as James Bald-
win has said, “the most despised
creature in his country . . . When
the country speaks of a ‘new‘ ne-
gro . . . it is not really referring
to a change in the Negro (which
it is unable to understand) , . .
but only to a new difficulty in keep-
ing him in his place. to the fact
that it encounters him (again!
again!) barring another door to
its spiritual and social ease.

The white community contents
itself with “tokenlsm,” but very
few Negroes view thisas progress.
It is shocking but true that so—
called “Christian” and “intelli-
gent” people perpetuate the di—
lemma of the Negro.

Why Mississippi

.\rchibald McLeish said in the
February issue of the M
Monthly, “The question which
haunts us now is how it (the
Mississippi Crisis) came about
. , was it a larger fault'7 . . .
a fault of all of us’? This isa
question everyone must answer for
himself, but never-the—less must
answot‘.

“What is the answer" The ans-
wer has to be through the love and
understanding of both races, Love,
not in the sentimental. cloying
sense, but in the spirit of aCcep—
tancc and reconciliation. “a tough
and universal sense of quest and
during growth,”

The solution of this problemlies
in our hands. \ just obituary
for us could well read, “They were
apathetic, anti faltered."
