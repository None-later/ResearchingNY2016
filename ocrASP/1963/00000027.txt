The longest Day’ Entertains
 numerous Shoftcomings Peters Comments On Dinner Line Letter

by Pool Jo-oo

There are many adjectives that
can be applied to The Longest boy.
with "impressive" and "enter-
taining" primary among them.
This massive film. produced by
Darryl F. Zanuck. is indeed a
great show: it has excitement.
humor and spectacle. It is how-
ever. not a particularly good
motion picture.

The movie is a detailed presen-
tation of D-Day from three inter-
mingled points of view - those of
the Germans. American. andBrit-
ish. The invasionis shown through
a long series of short scenes and
anecdotes about the men (and
women) involved.

Irony

Emphasized throughout is the
irony of many of the situations.
such as Gen. Marcks’ Cassandra-
likc prediction that the invasion
would be at Normandy. Yet what
comes through is a feeling of gen-
eral ineptitude (Henry Fonda. as
Gen. Roosevelt: "The best i can
figure is — we're on the wrong
beach").

in fact. the only ones who seem
to have any conception of the cir-
cumstances are the British. But
while the Americans and Germans
are both inept. there is a signifi-
cant difference. The latter are. at
least. cool. business-like and con-
fident. while the Americans appear
merely youthful. childish. and use-
less.

Phonoy - Patriotis-

This conception of the Ameri-
cans is part of the generalattitude
of the picture. There is aphoney-
patriotism. big-sell. hard-cash.
Hollywood flavor throughout. a fel-
ony which is compounded by the
theatre’s presentation of“The Star
Spangled Banner" before the film.

The American soldiers are nice.
clean-cut boys who. in the moments
before battle. think of home.
mother. girls. and money(invary-
ing order).

They are good fellows. and the
Germans are”the enemy" — this is
clearly the case, despite the
weighty. didactic. flag-waving

speeches thrown in (quote both
Nazi and Ally. “Sometimes i won-
der which side God isonz" the only
ones left after battle are "dead.
crippled or lost").

The stress on humor. and the
attempt to provide a punch line for
nearly every scene. results in some
effective humor. (Kenneth More.
as the beachmaster who. with his
bulldog Winston. "directs traffic"
at Normandy is the most success-
ful example.)

The film also has many very
well done battle scenes. Of these
mass actions. the standout is the
taking ofOuistreham Casino. which
contains one long. magnificent
tracking shot.

Compared to the other portions
of the picture. the German seg-
ments are outstanding. Bernhard
Wicki's direction is more than
competent. and the acting involved
is far superior to that ofthe Amer-
ican cast members.

Mitch Mlllor's Ghost

Where should the blame for the
less effective elements be placed?
Most belongs to: Zanuck who. in
an optimistic mood. directed the
American interior'scenes: Mitch
Miller. whose "sound" pervades
the background music like a
wraith; and the special effects
department for some unconvinc-
ing superimposed shots.

In addition. a great deal should
go to the script writers, who
managed to come up with corny
lines (referring to the invasion
“it'll work; it's go_t to work").
awkward lines (“I'm concerned
about the placement of our drop
zones." quoth John Wayne). and
even lines that sound like par-
odies of old Cagney war films
(Fonda again. this time protes—
ting his being kept out of danger.
“Isn't it because my father was
the President of the United
States?").

But despite these deficiencies
the film does manage to fit some
effective. exciting scenes into its
three hours. Why don't you see
it? It's a vast show.

Besides. 20th Century Fox needs
the money.

To tho Editor:

Thanks to Pat Jewell's article
under “Campus Current" in last
week's News. I want to say thatl
have gained a greaterappreciation
of “the dinner line.” Although i
am a Mtg standing member ofthis
line myself. lnever really contem-
plated my plight until Pat Jewell
brought it to my attention.

I used to look forward to that
line each day with the anticipation
of a relaxing few moments with
my friends. Now i realize that l
was wrong and that l have indeed
taken the line for granted. i have
therefore resolved henceforth to
regard “the dinner line" as “an
aesthetic experience" ofstomach-
grumbling.

.-\s to the food at the end of this
line. I must say that l was also
enlightened by Pat Jewell. I used
to think that the food was pretty
good for the price i paid. Needless
to say. PatJeweinroved me wrong
again. I have therefore taken my-
self in hand and persuaded myself
to regard the food in terms of
“canned peas" and “cork—sized
meatballs.”

ln thanks to Pat Jewell, I would

like to take this opportunity to
propose that Boy Scouts bring
dinner to each student’s room
after sampling each item. This

C OMM UNI CA TIONS

would eliminate "the dinnerline.”
and it would test the quality of the
food before student consumption.
Moreover, this would afford the
Scouts the opportunity to do their
“good deed for the day:" hence.
no extra cost for these services.
In conclusion. Miss Jewell. I
sincerely hope that your future
husband will have the means to
spare you the inconvenience of
standing in any line. whether super
market. bank. voting. or other. I
hope that one day you may “have
your cake and eat it too."

Letter On Food
Written In Jest

To the Editor:

In the last State University News,
in the “Campus Current” column.
I made a few remarks about the
dorm meals. .\lthough the article
was written for the most part
tonguc-in-check. and for the. pur-
poSc of humor. these remarks
could give the wrong idea.

good; 1 often hear comments at

Columbia Offers Teaching

Opportunities In Africa

James Lewis. .\ssistant to the
President. announced earlier this
week that persons interested in
teaching in .\frica may obtain in—
formation from Dr. Frank Carrino.
Draper 203.

.-\ program to prepare teachers
has been formed and is headed by
Dr. Karl W. Bigelow of Columbia
University.

Purposes

The purpose of the program is
“to provide superior preparation
for : (1) experienced elementary
school teachers and administra-
tors to qualify for assignments
in Africa; and (2) secondary
school teachers... for... assign—
ments in Central. East. and West
Africa.”

The “Joint University Program
of Preparation for Educational
Service in Africa" requires from
each candidate full-time study for
an academic year. This year is
spent in Teachers College. Colum—
bia t'niversity. and in the Univer—
sity of London.

Eligibility for admission is
based on “a strong Bachelor's
degree," background in needed
subject arcas. and “probable ca—
pacity to adjust successfully to
an unaccustomed cultural situa—
tion.

program include an average of$775
for tuition. $1,250 minimum esti-
mate of living expenses. and $275
for transportation to London. The
Program point out that these costs
are roughly the same as a year of
graduate study in America. This
program contributes to a Masters
degree.

Some fellowships are available.
Approximately twelve of these are
enough to cover all expenses.

with students from other colleges
who say our food compares fav—
orably with theirs. And of course
nothing can beat our Christmas
dinner! Considering the number
of students the Food Service feeds
and the budget they have to work on.
I think there is very little to
really complain about. We can
kid about it. perhaps. but that is
all it is. in the end.

The New York State Intercollegiate Athletic Conference will hold its annual

will resolve the issue.

Amendment Proposed

In a move designed at streng—
thening the organization. an
amendment has been proposed to
the Conference Constitution which
will require all teams within the
Conference to participate in all
leagues sponsored by the Confer-
ence.

;\t the present time State does not
participate in any ofthe Conference
soccer. baseball. or basketball
icagues.

In effect. if the amendment is
adoptcd at Cortland. (and there is
cvci’y indication it will be). State
will have been issuedan ultimatum
- either get all the way in the
Conference. or get all the way out.

Athletic Board Decision
The decision to get in oroutwill
be sqiiarcly up to the Athletic
Board and President Collins. At
the present time the re is no indica—
tion what they will do.

The decision. however. must
be reached by June 1. By that
datc, State will know where its

athictic future will lay.

ProblemsComplox

President Collins will probably
follow the recommendations of the
.\thletic Board. The problems
facing the Board are many and
complex.

Xmong the. questions which must
iic consideer are

(1) If State elects to remain in
the Confcrencc, Albany will boob—
Iigatcd to play all Conference
tcams. .\s ancxample.State would
havc to play l"redonia in baseball.

According to .\thletic Director
.\lcrlin Hathaway. “This does not
mzikc any scnsc, We have no in-
tcrcst in playing Fredonia. or
sonic of the other Conic rcnce
schools. If the tables were re—
vcrscd, how many State students
would turn out on the Playing
I'icld to soc us play I’rcdonia.”

(L’) If Statc cntcrs thc (‘onfcr—
\Ibany will have to abandon
many old established rivals like
Sicna and Iil’l With whom it has
:i long tradition.

(Ii) Should Stab-115.1I'nivcrsity
