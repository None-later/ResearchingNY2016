Retun of the

MEAT GRINDER

by Anna Pillsbury

While reading an article in last
week's State University Noon, [
was startled to learn that most stu-
dents here are not happy with the
food they're getting. Tsk. Tsk.

These happy days of genteel
living and nightly continental cui-
sine (apartment living) have made
me forget what it is like to stare
at palid dinner plates elsewhere.
l have therefore decided to share
some of my cooking secrets with
all foolish readers of this page.

;\_ny student can learn to cook
with little experience and equip-
ment. i did, so anyone can.
it saves money to do it yourself,
and you can be more. creative.
Pies, for instance. are easy.

Flour shortening (Spry, Crisco,
mineral oil, axel grease, or
crushed sunflower seeds), salt and
water must be combined with a
gentle hand into a smooth dough.
\V’ash gentle dough covered hand
and roll dough on a flat surface.
(ironing board, desk top, floor)
with a round object (empty whiskey

bottles are tremendous).

Then shape crust into pan or
large soup dish. Pourinpie filling
(for chocolate pie, use six melted
candy bars). Bake pie by sitting

Handy Hints for Stow

Stew is also a handy inexpensive
dish. Save small bits of meat
until you have. accumulated about
two or three cups of such tidbits.
Soak in water for four days and
add any vegetables you might have
lying around the house (your room-
mate, the potted plant by the win-
dow).

Season with salt, beer, garlic
powder and absynth and simmer
for two and a half hours. Float
leftover pieces of pie crust from
the previous recipe on top of stew
and se rye

Resourcefulnul for SandwichOI
Grilled cheese sandwiches arr-
also easy to make in the privacy
of one‘s dormitory room. First
biiv checSe and then confiscate a
liberal supva of bread and higher

priced spread from the dining
room.

State Student Discovers
Howls Friday loys late In life

Ethlebert Lovejoy had just three
major complaints about life: he
disliked people, hated loud noises,
and loathed drinking.

Even on Friday afternoons, Eth—
lebert Lovejoy was content to sit
disdainfully in his room at the
dorm and peer at the odd little
groups of TGlFers who marched
by on their weekly pilgrimage to
the cozy little nook near the big
stadium with the high picket fence
around it.

On one afternoon. the welcome
rays of sun on this otherwise Chilly
March day, somehow beckonedhim
from his room to seekthe myster—
ies of the proverbial and now-
legendary caravansary. He soon
reached his destination and, after
hesitating momentarily entered.

Acquaintanco Glimpsod

.Almost immediately, Fthlehert
Lovejoy was engulfed in the swirl—
ing, beer—drinking, gyrating mass
of humanity before him. Seeing
an acquaintance at a nearby table,
he started toward him: but, after
being pushed. elbowed. and thor—
ougth jostled by the lively crowd,
he somehow came to rest at another
table, engrossed in conversation
with a strangely familiar female.

More unusual, however, was the
glass of golden liquid that he
found himself pouring and, sur-
prisingly, enjoying. After scyeral
such draughts, and eyen a few
dances (which, for Fthlebert i.ove~
joy, was unheard of), the lateness
of the hour finally brought a halt
to his unexpected afternoon fes—
tivities.

ious weeks until one fateful day
in late April. \Vhile sippinga beer
at his customary corner table,
Ethlebert was struck, directly in
the left ear, by the errant missile
of a not-so—professional type dart
player.

Pull as he would, the dart re—
mained lodged solidly in Ethle-
bert’s head and absolutely would
not budge. Embarassed and highly
distressed, Ethlebert sprang up
from his chair and started for the
door.

Several people intercepted him
en route to ask why he wasleaving
so early. Poor Ethlebert could
simply shrug his shoulders and
mutter, “i can’t hear you — i‘ve
got a dart in my ear."

Tho Epitaph

As one might have expected,
Fthlebert struggled on. in anguish
for a few days; and then, almost
mercifully. he succumbed to the.
ill effects of the fatal wound.

His epitaph read simply: “lith-
elbert Lovejoy — Born 1943, F.x—
isted 1955-1962, Raged - 1963."
Yes, Ethlehert had departed, but
to this day, and ever—increasing
number of his closest followers
carry on the coveted Friday after—
noon tradition which he so faith—
fully upheld.
