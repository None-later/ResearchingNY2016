Fair Provides
F an & Proﬁt

by Sandy Donaldson

“You've laughed at the Times-
Union; you've laughedat the Knick-
News. Now laugh atthe Son at S.U.N.
for only ten cents." That's how
Sports Editor. Bill Colgan. sold
papers at State Fair last Saturday
night.

His shouts were echoed with
some variation throughout the night
at the many different booths lining
the hallways and filling the cafe-
terias.

The annual State Fair madness.
this year called “Grecian Earn
‘63" netted approximately $1400.
The money is always used to pay
the expenses of a foreign student
at State — this year. Eleni Kalit-
sounaki from Athens, Greece.

The top money-getter was the
Sigma Lambda Sigma "Soak—a-
Thon," which raised $104.81.

The second and third place
booths were Kappa Delta's ltalian
ices. which netted $78.95; and the
Newman Club Marble Game, which
raised $74.75. The Faculty Pastry
Booth earned $262.35.

Highlight of the evening was
Gamma Kap‘s show in the Com-
mons called “Senate l'nsuppres-
sed" — what it would be like if
“cavemen” invaded Senate.

During the activities the voting
for Mr. State Fair from the five

Senior finalists: .-\ndy Cibulsky.
Steve Condojani, Ted Dusanenko.
Pete Fisher. and Dick Kelly took
place. :\t the closing show the
winner was announced—Dick Kelly.

Maxine Bergman '66, won the
heart of the audience with her
guitar playing and singing. at the
closing show. Also. in this show.
Skip Schreiber '65. and Bill Laun—

dry ‘66. were at their funniest in
their take off on “What Ever Hap—
pened to Baby Jane."

Eleni Expresses

Appreciation

The ioIIowIng letter was written
by Eleni D. Kalitsounokl, the lorolgn
exchange student tram Greece.

1 would like to thank all of you
who have helped me to come and
study in your country this year.

I think that you have given me a
wonderful opportunity to study at
your l'niycrsity: not only to ini—
provc my knowli-dgi- of l-inglish
but also to learn so many things
about your educational system,
your way of life. vourcustonis, and
you its pcoplc.

l likc traveling tllltl | always
wanted to visit your country; but
I especially felt the need to do
so, after I entered lIlt‘ lfngllsli
liepui‘tiiicnt oi the l'iiivcrsity oi
\thcns

\lthoiigii I had lit‘i‘ll studying
Ianglish for many years. i always
thought that before i would start
teaching l‘llizllSIl as .i foreign Itlli'
guzigi: i should SiilV first in an Ifii—
dish—speaking country tiIliI haw:
[)I‘ilt'llt‘i‘ in speaking ll itlltl also
learn some of thc everyday cx-
[)t‘i‘Si-llt’itlh‘ which one doesn't learn
from books.

My dream came true when I
heard about the Student—Faculty
scholarship that you offered me
last June, just it few days before I
graduated from the i'iiiversity.

Next year when l gii back and
touch, 1‘]! try to give my students
not only grammar and idioms but
also a picture of your life.

()nce more I would like to thank
all of you who have financed my
staying but I also want to express
my particular thanks to those of
you who With your friendliness
have made my stay happy and n
difficult moments easier Thank
you.

 

And now, we proudly present our student from Greece. . . . . .

Potter Club President Explains Club Aims,
lie-evaluation and Suspension of Activities

“in order to keep alive the
friendships made in undergraduate
days. to promote the interest of
State College by interesting young
men of character in the teaching
profession at the State University
College at Albany, to further and
maintain a high standa rdamongthe
men of State College. to cooperate
more fully with the State College
Alumni Association. to keep our—
selves educationally alert. we, the
members of the Edward Eldred
l’otter Club. do establish this Con—
stitution and Ry—Law."

The above is the preamble to
the constitution of the Edward lil—
dred Potter Club, and is a state-
ment of the. aims. goals and pur—
poses of the Potter Club.

Recent events have indicated
that over a period of limc Potter
Club has strayed from the road
that represents the true purposi-
for its existence. in response to
various questions raised by Dr.
Collins concerning a recent cycni.
reply was made as follows:

"Dear Dr, Collins:

1 received your very thought—
provoking letter of March 7. \ftcr
much discussion and tillllIVSiS of
Potter Club's purposes. :tiiiis_ :ind
goals. we have reached lIli' follow»
ing tentative conclusion in regard
to the various qucsiions ruiscd

1_ Control over those winiring
jackets and authorization to xvi-:ir
them. When an individual ioiiis
l’ottc r (‘lub he purchases his own
t'lub jacket. This is his personal
property. He isauthorizwltowinir
the insignia on the jacket even
though the Club cannot cont rot when
and where the jiicket will be worn.
in reference to Cortland, this was
a University function not a (‘lub
function. and the individual rcprc—
sented the l'nivcrsity not the Club.

maximum achievement and to lead

to the origin. piist,present. and fu—

stated in our constitution. The
small discussion groups will pool

vide Potter Club aproperappreci-
ation of its heritage and a sound
basis for its future.

in summation perhaps an ap-
propriate thought is one which
i understand a former dean and
President of this college stress—
ed. “There is nothing wrong with
failure: the important thing is
what we do about it." We firmly
believe that both State I'niversity
at Albany and Potter Club will
benefit directly from this action
of the Club.
