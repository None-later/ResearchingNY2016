STATE L'NIVERSITY NEWS. FRIDAY. MARCH 22. 1963

ROBINSON ALREADY PREPARING FOR CROSS-COUNTRY.

by Bill Colgon, Sports-Editor

If you’re one of those hardy individuals who venture
out on Albany’s “streets” during the winter, at one time
or another you've probably seen a most unusual sight.
Provided you didn’t blink your eyes. you’ve most likely
seen a lanky, red—haired streak. dressedin track clothes,
racing down the block.

Now assuming further that you were even remotely
knowledged in athletics, you could make like a first grade
primer and say, “Look! SceTom run. See Tom run fast.”

Tom, of course, is none other than Tom Robinson, top
man on Albany’s highly—succcssful cross—country team,
and one of the best runners inthe State today. The cross—
COLmtry season ended last November, but where running
is concerned Tom has never heard the word end. Day in
and day out, since his last mcct Tom has run from three
to five miles for the sole purpose of getting into the host
shape of his life.

Aims To Improve Great Record

With a great record to look back ontundefcatcd in dual
meets, first place at LeMoyne Invitational, first place in
New York Indoor mile race), Tom has not come near his
full potential. But for a man with unlimited ambition, who
is to say what his full potential is’.7

It is no exaggeration :it all to say that Tom is the most
determined and the most dedicated athlete at State today.
He has adopted a spartan—like training program to build

on his tremendous record. As he has said, “I’m more
ambitious than ever before. I’mgoingto reallyimprove.”

Long Haul Ahead

Improving involves quite a bit in the cross-country
business. For Tom, it has meant a three to five mile run
every afternoon all winter long, weather permitting. But
in Albany, the phrase weather permitting is a relative
thing. The winds come roaring in like there was no to—
morrow, and the ground is always wet. Tom states mat-
ter of factly, “Some days the streets are so sloppy my
feet begin to freeze.”

But this is only the beginning. Once the weather
warms up. Tom plans to step up the pace considerably.
Two workouts a day (one in the morning, the other in the
evening) are on the agenda for this spring and summer.

Arduous Training Pays

As is obvious, Tom is a firm believer in arduous
training. He is a great admirer of the famous Percy
Ceruttey (the coach who made Herb Elliot a world
champion), and admits that it is his secret ambition to
train under him.

In the meantime, however, he is following many of
Ceruttey’s maxims. Instead of just jogging, he breaks
his daily runs up into sprints and slow—downs. Over the
summer he hopes to run in more natural surroundings——
especially on the beaches of Long Island.

Gradual Build Up
This carefully considered trainingprogramis designed

country season begins. Next Year’s schedule is tougher
than ever, with power—house LeMoyne listed for a dual-

Onc thing in favor of the Fed barriers, however, is
that cross—country is almost sure to gain recognition

This long—tie se rved ac-

tion will be all for the best, since with all of last year’s
fine squad returning, and a group of promising freshmen
entering, cross—country is likely to be the hottest sport
at State in the near future.

The competition won’t be easier, but with Tom in the
lead things look brighter than ever for Coach Munsey’s
charges. When Tom Robinson runs his first race next
fall he will be in the best shape of his life. For State’s
