treated to our first registration and
a series of tests. Was your sex
life satisfactory? . .

And Rivalry— willwe everforget
those days . . . sing, dance, begor

ful class guardians, Sue James and
Jim Clavell, helped us over the
rough spots. We became the first
class to win the skitand lose Rival—
ry.

This was the year of the Peer.

Publicity
We made the news with David
Boroff's article in the Saturday
Review and in turn gained a new

publication, suppression.

Elections saw the birth of our
class in student government. We
elected Fred Smith, Pat Pezzulo,
Jeanie Blazey, Art Coles. Marilyn
Dowd, and Lil Schmidt to lead us.
Our classbanquet, under the direc-
tion of Stroud and Schmidt. was a
success.

We became the first class to do-
nate money to the foreign ambas-
sador fund. in sports, our Frosh
soccer team came out on top. Be-
fore we knew it. .\loving-Up-Day
was here, with our own Roz Fer-
rari representing us so well.

By the time we went home for
the summer, we were indeed“The

Changes In Soph Year

Our sophomore year we came
back fighting. We became “spas-
tic" gay young sophomores. Fred
taught us how to play Ha, Ha on
dorm field.

The firls were promoted to 1:00
hours . . . and we all delighted in
giving warnings to freshmen. ()ur
beloved President was kidnapped
and in retaliation the Soph Extras
were born . . . “'0 again won the
Campus Night skit.

Since we we re a class of
“firsts.” we couldn‘t conceive of
doing anything as plehian as win-
ning Rivalry, so we tied it.

Junior Current
GONE -—

by Sue Murphy

The years creep by, but at a rapid pace — with days
like hours, and hours like days. Two and a half years
ago seven hundred and ten green Yellow Jackets walked
up the steps to Page Hall following the gleam of a thou—
sand candles and one hundred fourteen years oftradition.
We were, for the most part, young and alive.

Our ideals were beyond comprehension, our expecta—
tions incapable of being fulfilled, our zest for life and
desire for success untarnished. Since that night, many
things have come our way. We have moved through many
things — we have moved away from many things, from the
home which perhaps can no longer understand, from the.
friends who have gone on so many different ways, from
the ideals and innocence which was once legitimately
ours.

.\nd why have we moved away? We have moved away
because we have been able to look past those things
which the world (and we did once) admire. Our quest
for knowledge led us to the doorway ofa world in which
we saw the pain and suffering — permeated by the
torturous eternally unanswered 

’I‘he zest for life, the joy, the innocence remain in
part, but the remnants are tainted by this new aware—
ness of life’s shortcomings. We have seen more of
man’s limitations and of the strengthening force of
these limitations.

Our lives have come under the influence of so many
new and powerful forces and we have been forced to
discriminate, to test our ideals, to modify them, redefine
them and strive for their fulfillment — but never to
cast them aside.

We’ve learned many things in these three years.
We’ve begun to know how to learn — how to search —
for truth. We’ve begun to learn gratitude, courage,
serenity and wisdom. We’ve begun to become men.
We’ve begun to live. We’ve begun to die.

perform at Rivalry Sing.

STATE UNIVERSITY NEWS. FRIDAY, MARCH 29, 1963

Reflections...

by Joe Cambridge

in September. 1960, a group of
712 strangers sat in Page Hall,
and after a brief candle-light cer-
emony. the class of'64 donned their
beanies for the first time. Most
didn't know the person sitting next
to them, and there were very few
who knew more than five or six
people in the whole auditorium.

There were kids from all parts
of the state. with different in-
terests and family backgrounds.
and the small purple and gold
beanies were the only things they
had in common.

Friendships Fostored

Contrary to its literal meaning
Rivalry helped to foster many
warm and lasting friendships be-
tween freshmen and upperclass-
men, and, when rushing began,
we found other groups who were
interested in getting to know us.

Almost every freshman follows
the same routine, but it takes a
certain amount of time before we
can understand and appreciate all
that has happened. Sure, there
have been some rough breaks, but
there have been a lot ofgood times
too; when we consider the friend-
ships we have made, the badtimes
don’t seem so bad after all. it
is these same friendships that
make life worth living here, but it
seems that most of us take them
for granted.

l’m sure that most of us have
often felt like throwing in the
towel. but when we realize that we
could dissapoint a lot of people
who really care, we some how
find the strength to carry on.

These are some of the more
obvious benefits of our friend-
ships, but then there are the “lit—
tle" things that many of us for—
get: the borrowed sweater, the
bull sessions and the hen parties,
care packages, double dating, study
sessions, the much needed dollar
to save us from starvation, and
the smiles and greetings as we
wander through the peristylcs.

Puddle Muddle

If we look back just three short
years to that night in Page Hall. we
can see how much everything has
changed. Many of us who felt like
the proverbial frog in the “great
big puddle” have found that it isn't
very hard to get into the swim of
things.

Those who have left are still
with us in spirit, and they still
hold a place inour hearts and minds
that will be reserved for many
years to come.

l’m sure things will be the
same later on when Albany State
is just a memory. We won’t have
Rivalry, class meetings, or rush—
ing but there will always be people
who are ready to shake our hands,
crack a smile and share both our
joys and our misfortunes.

“To the Class of ’64: to the
warm unforgettable friendships we
have made; to the many warm and
lasting friendships we have yet to
make,“

President Bob Speaks to luniors

To Our Class -

()ur big day has arrived at last.
We've watched two other classes
parade through Junior Weekends
in all their glory, and, at last we
are here.

As Freshmen we were the“big-
gest and the best." in Rivalry we
seemed to win battles yet, when
the final vote was called. the class
of 1964 was shy a vote ortwo. De-
termined, and under “President
Fred’s" capable leadership. we,
as Sophomores fought an up-hill
battle and emerged as victors on
Campus Night.

Now, as Jolly Juniors. we can
well be proud of our record as
committee chairmen, Rivalry
leaders. student body officers,and

Dear Mom—

Well. here it is March 29already
-— upp, here It is JuniorWeekcnd—
and yesiree here i am a Junior,
— uh huh, here i am without a date! l
Granted i never went out in high
school and i should he used to it,
but sheez—a few dates never hurt
anyone.

i know you hate to hear me talk
like this, but geez, i wouldn't feel
so bad if there was just one good
reason; unfortunately there are ten
or twelve—ya know, beyond correc—
tion. .\nd i do feel bad. Me, i do!
(Ask anyone from here to DeWitt...)

i thought it would be nice if i
could line up about four or five
dates for the occasion, but you
know — i hate to force people into
things. i mean, I never realized
how great it was to be a freshman
or whomore around Junior Week-

most importantly, all-around class
participants.

50- here — on our big weekend,
let's pause a moment and think
back on times past: both good and
back; of friends made, andofgoals
achieved.

And now let us look ahead. In a
few months, we will be Grand Old
Seniors, and a few months later,
we will be out inthe bigwide world.
Not anymore will we be the biggest
class at STATE; we aren’tnow,but
we are, we always have been, and
will continue to be the best at
S.U.N.Y.A.

Thank you for your continued
confidence in me, and may “Our
Weekend” be the best ever.

.\lost sincerely,
Bob Fairbanks
