'AUTO DA FE’

bySteven Kore

On March 25. 26. 27. in the
Little Theater. Richardson 291.
three students of the Advanced
Dramatics Class presented three
plays by different authors. The
Straw by Eugene O’Neill. Ariode
Cope by Edna St. Vincent Millay.
and Auto De Fe by Tennesse \Vil-
liams.

Powerful Ploy
The first play. The Straw. di-
rected by Gladys Winkworth'64. is
a powerful play in which a young
couple. Steven and Eileen. meet
in a sanitarium where they are
recovering from tuberculosis.
Miss Winkworth presented Act if
scene it. where Steven is getting
ready to leave the sanitarium the
following morning. Eileen and
Steven run off into the woods and
bid farewell to each other. Eileen
tells Steven that she loves him:
but he does not love her.

Portroyol Built Slowly
The Straw had high dramaticten-
sion in parts. but at certain times
the interpretation of the play was
lost. The role of Eileen. as played
by Rosanne Ferraro ’64 built up

slowly and finally reached a cres-
cendo at the end of the play: Miss
Ferrara gave a warm and touching
performance.

However. Tony Hitchcock's '20
portrayal of Steven did not seem
to convey the meaning of the part.
His performance was slow and
ruined the point of the role: this
diminished greatly the intensity of
the play.

Miss Winkworth is to be com-
mended for her firm technical
control of the play: Rosanne Fer—
rara's make-up and hair—do were
excellent in conveying the physical
appearance of Eileen.

Ploy Changes Moods

Edna St. Vincent hlIllay's Aria do
Capo as directed by Miss Rosita
Palabay '63 is both adelightful and
a sad play. The title itselfconveys
the meaning of the play: it goes
from a farce. to a tragedy. and
back to a farce.

Aria de Capo concerns a group of
actors who present scenes of dif-
ferent types to the audience. Pir-
rot and Columbine. played by Law-
rence Goldfarb '63 and .\nne Smith
'20 respectively. presented a
farce: while two shepherds Cory-

World Finds Newest
Cuba Expert in Keating

by Joseph V. Golu

United States Senator Kenneth
Keating (Republican from New
York) is the world's newest Cuba
expert.

After several years as a do-
nothing congressman from the
Rochester area; the Republican
kingpins. .\lorhouse. et al. picked
him to run for the Senate in 1958.
He won narrowly while Rockefel-
lcr won by more than .halfa mil-
lion.

Next year he faces anotherelec-
tion. This time he will not be able
to rely on Rockefeller to carry
him through.

First Statements

Before last November's elec-
tions. Keating made a harmless
little statement about a few short
range defensive missiles in Cuba.
This statement could easily have
been taken from official releases
of the government,

Keating‘s use of the word mis-
siles set off the headline writers.
After the first headline. Keating
fell in love with the role of Cuba
expert.

it apparently does not matter to
Keating that he is not a member
of the Foreign Relations Commit-
tee. It does not matter to him or
any of the other Republicans that
he has never been in Cuba, let
alone any of its ever—increasing
number of caves.

Commitment to Fame

Mr. Keating took up the line of
the extreme right wing- thatCuba
was becoming an offensive base
for Communist attacks.

This was done with no evidence
except the word of the radical
right. Mr. Keating has produced
no evidence to this day.

He began making hisdaily state-
ments at the same time that the
government found out about the
long range. offensive missiles. He
did not make his reports to the
President. the state department,
or the Senate committees involved
in defense and security.

Withdrawal of Missiles

Kennedy began his surprisingly
strong actions against Cuba, Re-
publicans criticized Kennedy for
not leaving the Russians an easy
way out. The Russians found a way
out - withdrawal.

The ltusstans, of course. did not
allow us to inspect the miseries
which were remova It was notex-
pected by anyone that we would be

allowed to inspect the actual 'mis-
siles or even their casings.
Second Series of Charges

Soon after the world recovered
from the Russian debacle and after
the Republicans recovered from
November's elections. Keatingbe-
gan his second campaign.

This started with planted state-
ments that the FBI was trailing
Keating in order to find out his
sources of information. The second
step was Keating’s appearance be-
fore a Senate committee.

Keating did not reveal any in-
formation which can be termed
factual, He merely stated his be-
liefs as if they were facts. In a
few cases he was right. He expects
us to forget him when he's wrong
and re-elect him when he's right.

Troop Withdrawal

The withdrawal of Russian
troops has been attained not by
the words of Keating. StromThur—
mond. and Barry Goldwater. but
by the actions of the President.

What has Mr. Keating attained?
He got a lot of headlines and
probably a good chance for the en-
dorsement of the new Conservative
Party. Happy 1964. Air. Keating.

STATE UNIVERSITY NEWS. FRIDAY, MARCH 29. 1963

PROVES MOST ENIOYABLE

don and Thyrsis. played by Alex-
ander Delfini '64 and Harry Guy ’65
respectively. presented a tragedy.

Substitution Exceptional

Anne Smith's substitution into
the play in an emergency was ex-
ceptionally good in the role. The
most potent. effective. and striking
scene of the play was the death
scene of Corydon and Thysis. Miss
Palabay's direction of this scene
displayed her skill; it captivated
the audience and held their in-
te rests completely.

The technical end of Miss Pala-
bay's play was the best of all the
plays presented. The clown make—
up of Lawrence Goldfarb was stun-
ning and the sets and the costumes
of the play was attractive and ap-
pealing. .\liss Palabay also showed
her skill as a director in the suc-
cessful change from the farcical
plot of the story to the tragic
portion of the play.

Auto Do Fe Best of Evening
The high point of the evening
came with the presentation of.\uto
DziFe. This was a tightly knitplay
with an excellent interpretation by
Miss \‘ictoria Brooks ’64. .\utoDa

Fe deals with two people. Eloi.
played by Michael Gould ‘63. and
Madame Duvenet. played by .\lary
Temple '65. Eloi. .\iadame Du-
venet's son. is an over-protected
son. who is trying to break away
from his mother.

Burns House

At the post office he founda lewd
picture in an unsealed envelope
and brought it home with him. in—
stead of burning the picture at his
mother's request. he burned down
the house. Michael Gould's per—
formance as Eloi was deeply mov-
ing and convincing; but the most
brilliant. marvelous. and superb
performance of the evening was
given by Mary Temple in her por-
trayal of .\ladame Duvenet.

Setting Ploin

Brooks direction was simply
excellent. The set was plain and
realistic: and the lightingwas very
effective throughout the play. es-
pecially in the scene where Eloi
sets fire to the house. Miss Tem—
ple's costume and make-up made
her interpretation even more real-
istic.

Report Criticizes
N.Y.S. Education

A critical report on the status
of higher education in New York
State was published in the March
issue of “Empire State Teacher.”

[The front page article stated
that New York State when compared
to the other 49 states ranked no
better than 49 in the following
categories:

 Roegner Snares Bowling Honors;

Hale & fear Also loo Kogiers

In looking at the just—completed
AMlA First League Bowling season
one fact is outstanding: the qual-
ity of AMlA bowling has increased
substantially in one year's time.
There were more 600’s hit this
year than last year. more 200's.
more 170 averages. and so on. In
almost every respect the statis-
tics show that the bowlers this
year were better than ever. In
fact it may not be too much to say
that this year's crop of bowlers
was the best that State has ever
seen.

In making a comparison to last
year we see a big improvement
in all departments. For example,
as far as high triples are, con-
cerned there was only one 600
or better triple hit last year. But
this year there were seven hit!
The individuals who entered the
charmed circle were Don Hale.
635. Dave Roegner. 623 and 612.
Alex Sabo, 622 and 607, Don Fear.
619. and Kirk Ellis. 601.

As can be seen Sabo and Roegner
led the league with two 600's
apiece. Sabo hit his two 600's
back—to—back on the lasttwo weeks
of the season.

 

Roegner Excels

As far as high singles are con-
ce rned there we re more and higher
ones hit this year than last year..
Last season Dave Roegner had
high single with a 246. This year,
coincidentally enough. it was Roeg—
ner again who had the high single
with an identical 246. But the sig—
nificant thing is that unlike last
year Roegner wasn‘t the only man
to hit a 240 plus single. Fear and
Sabo also had 240 games. hitting
245 and 242 respectively.

There were also some fine 230
plus singles hit this season. Alert
Sutherland had a 237. Duffy Crahzin.
234. Don Ilrile, 235, Gary I’enfield.
233. and John High, 235.

In carrying the comparison bc~
tween last Benson and this season
one step further. llli‘i‘t‘ were many
more higher avcr‘agés this year
than last. Last season Siibo led
the league with a 172 average. and
his was the only average better
than 170. But this year Alex, who

 

upped his average to 174. could
only finish fifth. Roegner had high
average with an outstanding 179.
followed by Phil Thomas. Don
Hale. and Don Fear. 176. Sabo.
174. Tony Riservato. 172. Jim
Gittleman. 171. and Kirk Ellis.
170. Quite a jump in a year's
time: from one 170 averagebowler
to eight!

As far as trophies are concerned
Roegner will get one forhighaver-
age. Hale for high triple. 635. and
Fear for high single. 245. In ac—
tuality Roegner had a game one pin
higher than Fear's. but the AMIA,
following the lead of the American
Bowling Congress, does not allow
any one bowler to take more than
one trophy. Roegner. when given
his choice between the two tro-
phies. took the high average trophy.
Fear. since he had the secondhigh
single, then received high single
honors.

In addition each member of the
winning Unknown team will re-
ceive an individual trophy from
Schade’s Bowling Academy. The
team will also receive a large
team trophy from the AMIA.

Bowling Sweep

As for team triples the KB team
had the two top totals, hitting
2701 and 2674. both against Potter.
The Goobers had third high team
triple. 2652.

High team triples were hit by
the Unknowns. 936. Waterbury and
KB, 922. The KB team led the
league in team 900's with five.
followed by the Unknowns and the
Sophs. three apiece. the Goobers
two. and TX() and Waterbury one.

Some interesting statistics on
the season: low team single. 635.
low team triple. 1194. low indi—
vidual triple. 309. and low indi—
vidual single, 78! The person who
hit the 78, interestingly enough.
also had one of the highest singles
in the league. Name withheld!

At this point there should be a
list of all the bowlers intheleague
and their averages. However. this
is not possible as some unauthor—
ized person walked off with the
average sheet from the AMIA bul—
letin board.

sisted that the team was practicing

APA Cops 2nd Keg Loop
By Single Game Margin

The winner of the darkhorse
second AMIA bowling loop is no
longer unknown. The keglers from
APA turned the trick on the final
day of the league last week toedge
the Kobras for first place honors.

Close Roce

This one was a close race right
down to the wire. with three teams
in contention on the last day of
action.

The AI’A handicappers cinched
the title with a 4-0 decision. while
the Kobras were taking their match
3—1. This left the Kobrasone game
off the pace, as the teams hadbeen
tied up going into the final rouan
of bowling.

The Bombers were also in the
running all the way. as they only
finished one game behind the sec—
ond place Kobras.

Final Results

The final results were probably
the closest in the history of the
league.

The champion APA squad fin-
ished with an overall record of
35-17. usually enough to win the
league in a walk.

The Kobras tallied a 34-18
record, while the Bombers fin-
ished third with their 33—19 slate.

Doug Morton won high average
honors with a fine overall mark
of 160.

like a squash court with the balls

finished at 5:30 and went to the

Burlingame Tolhs

Coach Burlingame came over
and started to discuss the team and
the season ahead. When asked about
the returning lettermen the Coach
said he had six returnees. “Co-
Captains Gary Penfield and Gary
Smith (replacing Mike Camarata)
are the only two players that are
probably going to start for sure."

New Coming Prospects

The team will be reinforced by
last year’s freshmen and several
transfer students. The vacancy
left by catcher John Pavelka should
be an interesting battle. with two
good men, Tony Masculuso and
Dick ()dorizzi eligible for the post.

Pitching is Hopeful

Pitching was the biggest problem
last year (they had only two). About
this year’s moundsmen. the coach
said he had hopes this season, with
Joe Thorpe and Ray Weeks back
and a new possible star, Dick
Kimble. last year’s Frosh ace hur—
ler. They will be the mainstays
of the pitching staff.

Breaker Hitting

When asked abouthittingBurlin-
game said. “You saw for yourself
how they hit battingpractiCe pitch-
ing." They did look good. but then
that was not the kind of pitching
they would be seeing during the
year. The team looks fastand good
with the bat. It's too early to tell
about defense, but a good offense
is often the best defense. (Note
to Coach Sauers) All in all, the
outlook is good with a rough sche-
dule ahead.

The Opener
As for the opening game (you'll
all be there) which is April 20th
against R.l.'l‘., Coach Burlingame
said, “The only thing I can be sure
of is that Mrs. Eggleston will throw
out the first ball.”
