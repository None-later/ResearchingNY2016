NOW YOU CAN BE YOUNGER
THAN SHE IS

It is a scientiﬁc fact that girls reach emotional maturity earlier
than boys. For this reason freshman girls are reluctant to make
romantic alliances with freshman boys, but instead choose men
from the upper classes. .

Thus the freshman boys are left dateless, and many is the
night the entire freshman dorm sobs itself to sleep. An equally
moist situation exists among upper-class girls. With a .per-class
men being snapped up by freshman girls, the poor in ies of the
upper class are reduced to dreary, manless evenings of Monop-
oly and home permanents. ' ‘ I .d

It pleasures me to report there is a solution for this morbi
situation—indeed, a very simple solution. Why don t the two
great have-not groups—the freshman boys and the upper-class
girls—ﬁnd solace with each other? ' .

True, there is something of an age differential, but that need
not matter. Take, for example, the case of Albert Payson
Si afoos and Eustacia V e. I

albert Payson, a freshyman in sand and gravel at Vanderbilt
University, was walking across the campus one day, weeping
softly in his loneliness. Blinded by tears, he stumbled upon

“Why don't you watch where you're going, you minor youth.
said Eustacia peevishly.

“I’m sorry, lady,” said Albert l’ayson and started to “Hwy?

on. But suddenly he stopped, struck by an inspiration. Lady,
he said, tugging his forelock, “don’t think me forward, but I
know why you’re miserable. It’s because you can t gtatya (late.
Well, neither can I. So why don’t we date. each ‘other.

“Surely you jest!” cried Eustacai, looking wtth scorn upon
his tiny head and body. H ' )

“()h, I know I’m younger than you are, said Albert layson,
“but that doesn’t mean we can't find lots of fun things to do
together.”

“Like what?H she asked. . ‘ H

“Well,” said Albert i’ayson, “we could biiiid a biiowmaii.

“Bah i” said Eustaeia, grinding her teeth.

“All right then,” said Albert l’ayson, “we could go down to
the pond and catch some frogs." _ .

“Ugh 1." said Eustacta, shuddering her entire length. )

“llmvaboutsome itun-Shcep-llun?" siiggestedAlberti ayson.

“You are callow, green, and immature,” said Eustacia, iind

'Adopts’ Child
In South Korea

The sisters of Sigma .\ipha have
been notified by the Foster Parents
Plan of the assignment of an or-
phan. ciiﬁit-ycar—old JungOK Jun
from South Korea.

in 1945,.1ung's family fled from
Communist North Korea: and dur—
ing the Korean War in 1953 they
fled to Seoul. Jung's fathcrfiniiily
found work at a l'. S. Military
compound. where. in 1960. he died
of a heart attack.

Since the father‘s death, Jung's
mother and Duck Ki, the eldest
boy. have taken ow-r the responsi-
bility of supporting the fouryoung-
cr children age 14, 10. Ft, and 2 -—
all girls.

Duck Ki stopped his studies at
the University to support his fam-
ily by tutoring until he was called
into the Army.

Now the mother does laundry
and knits sweaters; but she can
never earn more than 30 cents a
day. The eldest girl has left
school and has gone to live with
relatives, earning her way as a
maid.

Jung’s family lives in a one
roon shack which has no sanitation
of any type. They receive an al~
lowance of grain from the district
office from time to time which
keeps them from starvation.

The Plan's aid will give Jung
the opportunity for an education and
will make life a little easier for
her family.

This appeal had not, at least in

therefore maintained its decision
of suspension.

Cortland Question

The entire “Cortland Question”
evolved from the activities ofsev—
eral Albany State students during
the weekend of March 1 and 2 at
the annual Cortland Basketball
Tournament.

In the days following this week—
end, it was reported that the be-
havior of some of the students
attending from Albany State had
been in poor taste. Because ofthese
reports the administration decided
that action must be taken.

Fraternities Questioned

Letters were sent to the various
fraternities involved (Alpha Pi Al-
pha, Potter Club, andSigma Lamb—
da Sigma). The letter questioned
whether such action was condoned
by the fraternities and what action
had been taken.

Upon study of the responses to
these letters, the administration
decided that the action taken by
the fraternities was not adequate.
(in ’l‘hursday, March 14. the mat—
ter was referred to li'f'YSK:\Ni.-\,
the judicial body of the student
association, for consideration.

Accordingly, MYSKANIA estab—
lished a procedure and began an
intense 2 1/2 week investigation.
Meeting from 3 to 4 hours every
day, seven days a week, the judicial
body investigated and studied the
individual action and over—all im—
plications of the “Cortland Ques—
tion."

ings.

Myskania then founditnecessary
to issue summons forformalhear~
lugs to those who had been most
seriously implicated.

Cuiminating its investiga-
tion. MYSKANIA posteda reporton
Monday afternoon, April 1. it
stated that “there had been serious
misrepresentation ofthe Universi~
ty,” and recommended that action
be taken against several of the in-
dividuals involved.

Standards Questioned
Michael Gimigliano was given a
judicial reprimand by MYSKANIA
and “advised as to the import of
his future actions." James
Haenlin, recentlyexpeiled fromthe
University was refused readmit-
tanee for the 1963 fall semester.
John McManaman, a senior. was
placed on social probation for a
period of six months. An Ad—
ministrative reprimand was given
to graduate student, Daniel Schultz.
Donald Sherman. an Albany Alum—
nus, was sent a presidential letter
“expressing disapproval ofhisac-
tions” at the Tournament. Joe
Zwickibauer was suspended forthe
rest of the semester.
:\ll offenses were recorded upon
the individuals’ University record.
it'lYSK.-\Nl.-\ also reported that
they felt there was a more “pro—
found” issue involved here titan
just the action of the above men-
tioned individuals. They felt con-
cerned in regards to “accepted
standards and value of a segment
of the student body."
