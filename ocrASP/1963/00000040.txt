Eve Da
To top AMII Doubles Tournament 0"? y

Don Hale and Tom Jones woothe
AMlA doubles tournament held re-
cently at Schade's Bowling Acad-
emy. In winning the tournament,
Hale and Jones finished only twenty
pins ahead of the second place
team of Dick Kimball and Kirk
Ellis.

The tournament was ' conducted
on a handicap basis and covered a
two-week period. The handicap
was based on 3/4 of 180; that is,
a person’s handicap was figured
on the difference between his and
a 180 average.

To give an example, Al Sabo had
an average of 174; that would give
him a handicap of 6 pins 21 game.
But since the handicap is on a 3/4
basis, Sabo’s handicap would be
four pins a game (halves don’t
figure in) and not six. The purpose
of the handicap is to give even the
lowest average bowlers a chance
to win the tournament.

Hale and Jones had a twelve-
game total of 2311 as compared to
Kimball and Ellis’ 2291. Jones
also had the high scratch triple
(without handicap) with a booming
601, and Kimball had the high band-
icap triple, 636 (580 scratch with
a 56 pin handicap).

Al Barnard had high scratch

STATE NINE DPEN TDMDRRDW
PEDS TD FACE RIT AT 2 00 PM.

On April 20 the 1963 State base-
ball season will begin. The outlook
right now is bright. The team, like
the Mets, is young and fast. Unlike
the Mets, they plan to win their
games. Coach Burlingame is not
making any promises, but he is
sure that Miss Eggleston will have
the first ball honors.

Young Stars in Lineup

The Coach isn’t sure about an
opening lineup, but he suggested
possible candidates for each po—
sition. Co-Captain Gary Smith
is a good bet to be at First. At the
keystone spot is Mike Putney. a
Soph. ilis DP partner should be
another Soph, Don McGurrin. The
third base position should be either
Ed Bromiield or Joe Mazzarulli.
Rounding out the infield at the
catcher’s spot are Dick Odorizzi
and Tony Macaluso.

Outfield Questirn Mark
The outfield is the big question
in the mind of Coach Rurlingame.
The only sure starter in the out—
field is the other (To—Captain Gary
l’enfiold. The powerful Penfield
will be in his centerfield haunt.
