FILLING A WELL-NEEDED GAP

Although my son is a college freshman, I am glad to say that
he is still not too old to climb up on my lap and have a heart-
to-heart talk when things are troubling him. My boy is enrolled
at Harvard where he is studying to be a ﬁreman. From the
time he was a little tiny baby he always said he wanted to be
a ﬁreman. Of course, my wife and I believed that he would
eventually grow out of it, but no sir, the little chap never
wavered in his ambition for one minute!

So here he is at Harvard today taking courses in net holding,
mouth-to-mouth breathing, carbon tetrachloride, and Dalma-
tian dogs. It is a full schedule for the young man, and that, in
fact, is exactly what we talked about when last he climbed
upon my lap.

He complained that every bit of his time is taken up with his
major requirements. He doesn't have so much as one hour a
week to sample any of the fascinating courses outside his major
—history, literature, language, science, or any of the thousand
and one, things that appeal to his keen young mind.

I am sure that many of you find yourselves in the same
scholastic bind; you are taking so many requirements that you
ain't ﬁnd time for some appealing electives. Therefore, in to-
day’s column I will forego levity aiitl give you a brief survey in
a subject that is probably not included in your curriculum.

I have asked the makers of Marlboro ('igarettes whether I
might employ this column normally a vehicle for innocent
merriment ~to pursue this serious end. "(if course you may,
crazy kid," they replied kindlily, their grey eyes erinkling at
the corners, their manly mouths twisted in funny little grins.
If you are a Marlboro smoker and what intelligent human
person is not‘.’r~you would expect the makers of Marlboro to
be fine men. And so they are Wonderful guys, every man-jack
of them good, generous, understanding, wise. They are each
tipped with a pure white filter and come in soft pack or Flip-
Top box.

Hut I digress. We were going to take up a topic you are
probably unable to cover in your busy academic life Let us
start with the most basic topic of all anthropology, the study
of man himself.

Man is usually deliiicd as a tool—making animal, but l per-
sonally do not find this definition entirely SMIISfIII'lHl'T. Man is
not the only species which makes tools. The simians, for ex«
ample, make monkey wrenches.

Still, when you come to a really complicated tool like a
linotype, foi' instance you can be fairly sure it was made by
llomo sapicns or else a very intelligent tiger. The question one
should ask, therefore, is not who made the tool, but who! did
ilt' do with it.

for chinple, in a recent cm'avation llt thi- illduyai tioi'ge a
large :issoi'lnicnt of boniinoid fossils was found, all dating back
to lllt‘ .\llilillc l'lclstot'clil' Age llll'lcd with lill‘ fossils was a
number of their artifacts. the most interesting being a black
metal box which emitted a steady bet-ping sound. Now, of
i‘lilll‘St', zoologists will tcll you that tree frogs make Sllt‘ll boxes
which they employ in lltl'll‘ mating activities (i can't go into
detail about it in this family newspaper; but the eminent an-
thropological team. .\ll‘ and Airs. Wulthci' .Sigafoos [both be
and she are named Wallbcri were convinced that this particular
box was madc not by free frogs but by Neanderthal men. To
prove their point, they switched on the box and out t‘llllti'
lclcyision, which, as c\ei‘,\'one knows, was the forerunner of fire

The Albany League ofArts. Inc.,
is sponsoring three performances
of unusual significance at Page Hall
which should be of interest to the
students of State.

On Saturday, April 20th at 2:30
p.m. and 8:30 p.m. the New York
Shakespeare Festival Company
will present its highly acclaimed
production of Macbeth.

On Thursday, April 25th at 8:30
p.m. (IE matinee) the Metropolitan
Opera Studio will present its pro—
duction of the opera CisL Ego
Tutte.

Because of the support given
these attractions by the New York
State Council on the Arts, tickets
for the matinee will be $1 and for
the eveningperformances,$2. Stu—
dent tickets for§l_l_ performances
will be 50¢. Tickets are now on
sale at the Co—op.

Because of a reorganization of
the State Council on the Arts,
chances are that never again will
students be able to see attractions
of this caliber for suchalow price.

Feasibility of Shelters
Questioned By Student

To the Editor:

It now appears that we attend, not
a university as the administration
\ ould have us believe. but an over~
grown, ivy—cove red fallout shelter.
Instead of learning about litera—
ture. history, et '41., we will now
learn the fine art of survival when
(not if) there is a nuclear war.
not only object to the exceptionally
poor psychology involved in the ex—
istence of fallout shelters and the
idea of having them in a college
(oops! excuse me, of course, l
meant university) but most of all
the fact that our own (our vcryown
just think of it!) shelter's capacity
has been appraised at seventy
people. In the cvontofwar who will
these seventy be? Will they be the
first seventy to reach the shelter,
the strongest seventy to reach it,
or some preselected group"

If it is the last, how will tlic
seventy be selected? \\'ill lllcy bc
certain members of the, adminis—
tration and faculty, the, seniors
with the highest nVcragos, or
merely the noarost secretaries and
the staffs of the co—op and medical
offices? Perhaps the students will

Seniors Protest Arguments

Against Sororities

To the Editor:
It seems there has been quite :1

bit of talk thrown around this
campus regarding the contribu—
tions made by fraternities and

sororities. From our point, it
Seems to be one thing—’l'.\l.l\’—and
nothing more than that. So we are
going to add our few words to thc
ba rragc.

We have been told that \\’4- must

We may be allowed to continue to
exist, but why is it that we do not
ask unyolii- to prove our tlSt‘ltiss—

value of their particular fraternity
and sorority in terms of tangible
things \thi a g‘i'i-ut deal that anv

and Fraternities

Instead oi remaining on the weak
foundation that we now have, let's
go beyond and ask for more. Yes,
we do want houses and if this is
physically impossible, we want
dorms — one floor, two floors, or
three, deponilingon the necessity.

'l‘hore should be a method of
giving birth to new tiri-cksanilll’t‘

the proposed number of pcoplc in

Reviewers Note

Improvements

In Design, Content of ‘Primer’

Poetry Avoids
Shock, Obscurity

by Richard Lovoroni

Those who found the cover of
this year's Primer attractive and
a welcome relief from the pseudo—
sophistication and artful sloppi—
ness of its more recent predeces—
sors will be pleased to learn that
its contents are as inviting and
Well chosen. The poetry, although
not outstanding, is of good quality
and each one has something to
recommend it so.

Although no one has been guilty
of using a traditional form and
many images are conVcntional,
one finds simple but felt thoughts,
well expressed, and a variety of
them. One feels that the editors
have avoided as criteria of choice
favoritism, the need for filler,
and the desire to shock.

Few poems require more than
one reading to grasp their literal
meaning; obscurity has not been
cultivated. Some invite and re—
ward a second and third rcadi'ng
and a very few of their images
Will be remembered.

First laurels must go to Dale
Ketcham, who is represented by
four works. He is fond of short
lines and correspondent imagery.
“This Agra of l“cai“’by Lenny Grey
is notable for its emotional quali-
ty as is Nicholas \\'heldon‘s
“Stasis” which has more rigor.
(‘zcnowyk’s “(‘arnivora” posesan
interesting question although his
control of word and form is weak.

(in the lighter side there are.
short sharp little. satires by poets
Purcell, De Pam. and '/.eiglcr.
Two other short but extremely
effective pieces are “Nightmare
in Color" by Judy Vollch and
“Drifting” by Barbara Lcuthner.

This is only a suggestion as to
the many good poems included. I
have seen students refuse to ac—
cept the Primer during distribu—
lion. Those who do so this year
are only hurting themselves.

Successful Prose

ductions of recent years, The

The other entry by Hobo rt Judd,

“The Month of the Unicorn," is
a delightful fancy. The poignancy
and exhilaration of a drunken adol-
escent confronted with an appealing
definitely earth-centered Lillian
is magical.

“A Martiniful of Olives" and
“The Wink" indicate by contrast
the difficulty of writing effective
light fiction. “The Wink" carries
the unmistakable taint of The
Saturday Evening Post — silly.
superficial.andindifferently slick.

“A Martiniful of Olives". on the
other hand, is highly polished. but
skillfully hints at below—the-sur—
face characterization, creating a
bitter and amusing effect.

\thitney Fish is a bit too clever
and blatantly didactic in his treat-
ment of “Everyone in the World
is Christ and They are all Cruci—
fled."

the theme of the threat de-
stroyed before recognition is all
too frequent in clever fiction. The
story is enjoyable and adequately
presented, but Fish is capable of
more powerful and less sopho-
moric writing.

Fish's other entry. “Come
Home, Come Home, It's Dinner
Time," does not attempt as much
and is successful. The mood of
suspense is skillfully built,andthe
unseen presences oft'ncle Richard
and his family before the climax
a re made almost palpable.

“The “bite-Haired Lady“ is a
prim, darling tale of a cute old
lady. at small town wedding, and a
smart young college girl. The
narrator has a condeseending at-
titude toward her subject. .ind the
subject is commonplace.

Two Stories About Judas
Frunkonis and Gomez treat the
betrayal of Judas and his death.
Both studies present a misunder—
