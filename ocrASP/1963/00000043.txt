STATE UNIVERSITY NEWS. FRIDAY,

 

Campus Current

by Sue Murphy

“Whatever is is right.” But what 13? How much of
what I am really is? Am I what I appear to be or do
I appear to be other than I am? Is my conception of
self based upon what I would be or what others would
have me be or what others believe me to be? What and
who am I? How much do I owe to myself - to Society?
Has society made me what I am because I will be what
Society would have me? - I speak of Society now not as
the forces about me which may perhaps bring about
certain aspects of my life but rather the forces within
me — and the willful, deliberate alteratimofbehavior in
order to please — to please a god, a world, a man.

Is it wrongto strive to be as others would have me be?
What is hypocrisy? Should man establish a’ code of
ethics and morality independent of all relations with the
standards of Society? Must each man strive for perfec-
tion unaided by the standards of his neighbor? Can he
function as a “part of the continent” ifhe has set up his

goals as an island?

And yet could not a society degenerate into a flaccid
state if its standards become relative—do we not some—
times believe ourselves to be good merely because my
neighbor is a little less good? Is it wrong to vainly hope
that another might profit by perceiving my life, my way
of living, and I in turn from them?

How can I know what is right whenI do not know what
is — if I know not what I am? Do I need to know this in

order to live.

— No, but this is of little importance. It

matters only if I need to know this in order to die.

llmhcltz Discusses Responsibilities

The following statement, con.
cerning fraternities, was submit-
ted by Mr. Robert l'mboltz at the
Fraternity Workshop “2 on March
21. 1963. Mr. I'mholtz isagradu-
ate of State i'niversity of Albany
and is an active alumnus of Potter
Club.

The fraternity problem at State,
as I see it, is not something that
can be specifically solwdbyl Ft‘,

The things that Were discussed
at the last meeting included such
items as academic standing, social
department and the image of the
fraternity before the school and the
community. (‘ertaini-mphasiswas
given to the idea of being a social
fraternity.

For my pa rt,i reject the idea ofa
social fraternity in the sense that
a social program is primary and
other things secondary.

Properly administered, student
government coulrbcertainlv pro—
duce a social program for the stu-
dent body. In the matter of hous-
ing, the school can certainly pro—
Vide this.

l feel that social program and
housing are rte-enforcements. for
the main reason, for the i-Xisti-ncr-
of fraternities which is to produce
better men by emphaslzmg ltit‘iilH,
Ideals are the basis of a trut-
fraternity. I‘hr-y are,orshouidbe,

Now in regard to the individual
fraternities here at State, I .issuiiie
that at the beginning each was
founded for a specific reason i
would question .is to how many,
today, really realm-orunderstand
the reason or purpose for which
they were founded

l would not question forone llilfl‘
ute the ability of the indivntual
members to recite objectIVes,
slogans, etc, i would question,
though, how much thought or seri-
ous discussion has been givwi
to aims or objet tlves.

The things discussed at the last
meeting. such as leadership, aca—
demics, social development, and
public image are all excellent
ideas. Hut let us examine them in
terms of todays fraternities at

State.

Every group has its own leade rs.
be they good or bad. There are at-
so in each fraternity people with
leadership potential who need tobe
encouraged or developed. What
fraternity has a program to do this?
Another very important aspect if
officers. “be here can state in ab-
solute truth that the election ofof—
ficers is based on ability rather
than popularity.

How many of the fraternities
emphasizes as a way of life ac—
ceptable academic standards.
Much talk has been devoted to
achievement of minimum stand-
a rds for acceptance into a fraterni-
ty. to crash study programs, to
assist new pledgcs, to achieve
these criteria. iiut how many fra—
ternities periodically examine the
sum averages and work of all the
members of its group todetermine
areas of weakness and put forth
programs to prevent academic
failures,

ence that any fraternity .Ii State

Players DeveloP Characters Poorly
In ‘Macbeth’ Adventure Story

by Harry Guy

Last Saturday The Albany
League presented the New York
Shakespeare Festivals production
of MACBETH. it wasn’t a student
tax card production but special -
and very reasonable — discounts
were offered to students.

The production itself was ﬂashy
and much too modern. it relied
heavily on special effects. Music
played an important part in this
production; and at times sounded
like Paul Anka's thrilling score
for The Longest Day.

Too Many Bells

When MACBETH was thinking.
we heard the bells of his thought,
when he paused suddenly the hum
of his brain skippedabeat. Hecate,
the leader of the witches. spoke as
a prerecorded voice — and it
sounded poorly prerecorded.

MACBETH is a play about power
and the way power affects people.
It is a play of characters. in this
production, the lyrical thoughts of
Shakespeare were subordinated to
the guts and glory of the situation.
The play lacked the necessary
depth in characterization.

As Lady MACBETH, Betty Mil-
ler was quiet and sustained

0i Fraternities

present thinking and must be ac-
complished by evolution.

I would dare say that the first
step for revitalizing the fraterni—
ties has already been lost, that of
the pledge education. Further, I
would say that this year, as usual,
there was a traditional, useless
pledge training program.

I feel that first, asl.l’.(‘. repre-
sentatives, you must establish what
the fraternity should do.

Is it to be the vehicle to provide
a means ofclosc group relationship
with the objectives ofcducational
and social maturation of its in—
dividual members, or is it to be just
social in its present form'? The
former, I believe, provides a solid
basis for continued cmstence. The
latter provides no basis.

The next step is the indoctrin-
ation of the officers of each group.
In conjunction with this, each group
faces the immediateproblemofthe
election of its new officers based
on ability and not popularity.

The next step is the indoctrina-
tion of the individual members of
each group to this revualizedcom
cept as to the purpose of a fra—
ternity.

The last, and perhaps the most
important step, is the ability and
Willingness ofthe various frail-rm»
ties to discipline their own mem—
bers when they fail to live up to
the criteria or who in any way
tarnish the image that the TI‘ZIII‘i‘ltl'
ty should be exemplifying.

to briefly sum it tip, if Wt’ ac—
ci-pt thi- pi'cmisc that the proper
purpose of a fraternity is to pro»
\‘ltll' thi- way for a close knit re-
lationship among man With its
objectiycs as the educational and
social deiclopincnt of each (in IIS
Illtt'SI and broadest sense), iht‘ii
our problem i'-i basically how to
accomplish this revolution in cur~
rent thinking by a process of
evolution. The basis problem lies
With the thinkingandattitudesofthe
present members of" the fraterni-
iith.

I feel sure that in each fraterni—
ty, there is a core that i‘l'tilllt' the
true value a fraternity can offer,
[lot too often, they are the more
qtiiet and less outgoing. \Iso,
under tiic democratic procedures,
they are often out-voted. I feel
also that the II“ (' representatIVes
bavo little, if any, influence intheir
respectiVe organizations.

throughout the play. But Lady
MACBETH should be loud and con—
niving; she must fall into torments
of emotional strain. There mustbe
a different in Lady MACBETH be-
fore the king's murder and after.
Here there was none.

Bunquo Turns Dracula

Banquo (John Ragin), will beget
kings but not be a king himself,
was good in acomparatively minor
role. But the handling of his re-
turned spirit was atrocious. He
looked like a bloody Dracula bent
on a quick neck.

MACDUFE (Mitchell Ryan) came
alive only after he was told his
family was dead. In a poignant
sequence MACDI'FF doubts their
death but then quickly determines
to revenge himself on MACBETH.
But before this scene, MACDI'FF
seemed stiltcd and iil-at—ease.

The \\'eirdSisters were bewitch-
ing. Their scenes were handled
very carefully; they had the right
amount of comedy and just the dash
of seriousness necessary for prop—
er effectiveness.

The porter (Charles Durning)
was a bit ovcrplayed at times, but
was never-the—Icss very funny.
The rest of the cast seemed hardly
distinguishable; they were just a
mob reciting lines.

MACBETH Key to Play

play was Michael Higgins playing

Eight Academy Awards 60 In British; Sargeant Suggests Better
Choice of Winners llct Surprising

by Paul Jonun

Although they were given out
several weeks ago. the 1963 Acad-
emy Awards still remains an oc-
castional topic of conversation.
Again this year there was little
that was surprising about the
choices.

Certainly it was no shock that
Lawrencc oi Arabia was awarded
the honor of being the best film of
the year. Of the other nominees
(To Kill a Mockingbird, The Longest
Day, The Music Man, Mutiny on iii.
Bounty) only the choice of Mock-
ingbircf had any validity. Even that.
or any other good film of the
year, was no competition for the
epic biography.

5 of 6 Doserved

It was obvious that Lawrence
would take Best Picture, (if the
other six awards it won. five (di—
rection, art direction-color. cin—
ematography-color, film editing,
and sound) were also richly dc-
servcd. The sixth. for musical
score. is perhaps more wishful
thinking. Since all the performers
nominated for iicst Actor did ex—
ccllent jobs, the Academy must
have found it necessary to resort
to other criteria. The result was
the presentation of thc statuettc to
Gregory Peck. A "sentimental
favorite". poor Greg had never
won the big one despite his long
years of reliable, competent serv-
ice to the industry.

O'Toole or Quinn

Probably a better choice, per-
formance-wise. would have been
Peter O'Toole or Anthony Quinn,
who was not even nominated for
Requiem for a Heavyweight.

The decision to acclaim Anne
Bancroft best actress was a wise
one, as her portrayal in Tho Mir-
ocfo Work" was movineg
wrought. Patty Duke. in the same
film, was the best supporting ac-
tress -— another good choice. al-
though Angela Lansbury was my
personal favorite.

The awarding of the Best Sup-
porting Actor Oscar to Ed Begley
was another “sentimental” award.
His performance in SwoorBird oi
Youth, while good. was overshad-
owed by those of Terence Stamp,
Omar Shariff. Telly Savalas and
Anthony Quinn (this time not nom—
inatcd for Lawrence).

British Grab 8 Oscars

One cannot complain about the
quality of the performances that
were honored, but it is difficult not
to wonder at the motives behind
them and to speculate on the pos-
sibility of other. and better.
choices.

The general effect of the Awards,
taken together. is a victory for
the British (8 Oscars), the stage'
(Hancroft—Duke—Beglcy) and for-
eign language films (original
screenplay and live short subject).
(if the nearly 25 presentations, a
mere nine were made to the home—
grown product,

Viva la difference!

ommunicatron System

To the Editor:

i recently read the letter to the
Editor from the State University
News. Being a memberofa frater—
nity, the Secretary of the Interfra-
ernity Council 1962-63, and Con-
stitutional Chairman for the same
group, i can, of course, agree that
fraternities have a place on this
campus. 1 do, however, feel that
the writers missed the point on
several of the issues and are asking
for a campaign which would be
nothing more than yelling.

Too often we have seen this kind
of battle end up in monsterous de-
feat. Such was the case in the tuition
battle and severaiothers in our re-
cent past. It is next to impossible
to convince others than an institu-
tion should be kept only because WE
want it.

it would be more productive ifwe
would first take an objective look
at the fraternities and at the pro-
posals th'i have been presented.

Too often we hide behind the
words "social fraternity" when we
are presented 33y form of change.
Social does not mean just partying
and drinking, it means m
having to do with humans living
together. This definition takes in
a c a de m t c 5, leadership develop-
ment, physical development and
much more in addition to parties.

We look to the nationals for ideas
on how to winourbattles; why don't
we look to the same source to see
what functions they serve? If we
did we would see that they already
have the very things we are asked
to work toward. We are not asked
to do anything new or different.

to realize what they must do.

The [PC has held two workshops
trying to overcome the apparent
communication problem, but still
there is NO action. The Council
and member fraternities of [FC
have asked for a revision of an

dated. This action is very com-
mendable, but when a constitution
was presented that provided the
barest minimums for a strongIFC
each of the groups decided that it
did not like the changes.

The way it looks now we will
probably come up with a constitu-
tion which is no more than a re-
writing of the old one just as has
been the fate of the four other re—
visions in the last ten years.

i would suggest thatthe demand-
ing in each of the fraternities
should be to find out exactly what
the constitution says and to have
the Chairman or perhaps Mr. MC—
Kinnon, lF‘C Advisor. explain the
reasons for the changes. Without
the addition of a Junior lnterfra-
ternity Council, I can see no wziy
of developing new lEC leaders.

Without the Judiciary Court, I
can see no way of keeping frater-
nity disciplinary p roblc ms from
continually goingto MYSKANIA anti
from hecomingunfavorable public-
ity.

in the individual groups itisim—
portant to eliminate the current be-
lief that the proposais that come
from the administration are
threats and the acceptance ofthem
is appeasement. Each proposal
must he considered on its merits
and its merits alone! We mustbe—
gin a program to get each gre kto
be able to verbalize greek aims
and not just read them..

We mustalso stampoutthe belief
in some groups that when a set of
aims is approved in a meeting, the
group by this action alone has the
set of aims. To actually have them.
the aims must first be effectively
implemented. I am aware thatthis
takes time anda Iotofmistakes.but
there are people who will gladly
help groups who want it.

Strange as it may seem, some of
our inactive members can be very
helpful in this line. Once we are
able to we rbalize our aims, we must
be absolutely sure that each new
pledge is indoctrinated andthathe,
too, can verbalize the aims. Once
again it is at this point and not
earlier that we, can begin our battle.

In conclusion l wouldlikc to sug—
gest that SI‘N canplayasignificant
role in this battle. Have a reporter
who knows the workings oleC and
ISC at all meetings ofthese groups
to insure transmission of news in
the greek field to your readers.

Perhaps run a seriesofcolumns
on the idealogy of greeks on this
campus so all will understand the
views of the various greeks. This
program would be enlightening not
only to the greeks, but to the very
interested liltit'pentiﬁnili as well.

Sinccrcly,
Robert Sergeant
