STATE UNIVERSITY NEWS, FRIDAY. APRIL 26. 1963

STATE SEVERS CONFERENCE TIES

Kim Gifford. Chairman of Ath-
letic Board. makes the following
official announcement concerning
the Athletic Board's decisionon the
Conference question:

As of September 1963 the State
University of New York at Albany
will no longer be a member of the
State University of New York Ath-
letic Conference (SUNYAC).

This withdrawal was recom—
mended to President Collins on
April 2. 1963 by the Athletic Ad-
visory Board and accepted by him.

The SUNYAC hadoriginally been
established by the State teachers
colleges to facilitate andpromote a
certain consistency and upgrading
of intercollegiate standards among
the teachers colleges of New York
State.

Revisions Proposed

On March 1. 1963 the Constitu-
tion Committee of the SUNYAC‘
proposed certain constitutional re-
visions to its members which, in
effect, changed the emphasisofthe
conference to that of a scheduling
conference, with the resulting ef—
fects:

(1) Any member of the confer-
ence must be a playing member.

(2) Playing members must par-
ticipate in all conferences (for in-
dividual sports) provided by this
conference.

(3) To participate in individual
sports conferences a member must
play every other member in the
conference which had that sport.

Effects Undeeiroble

The resulting effects on Albany
would have been:

(1) To give up certain opponents
now played (for instance, possibly
RPi) in order to play members of
the conference such as Fredonia.

(2) A resultingdisadvantage both
to the athletes and the school in
time traveling involved and costof
the program respectively.

(3) A scheduling of opponents
which were not of our present or
possibly future size, but rather a
reversal of our future plans for
scheduling because of our antici-
pated growth.

Withdrawal Recommended

Therefore, on April 2, 1963 the

Athletic Advisory Board recom-
mended to President Collins that:

(1) Our Athletic Director be di-
rected to vote against the proposals
which would set up the SUNYAC
as a playing conference.

(2) in the event the proposed
constitutional changes were
passed. Our Athletic Director be
directed to inform the conference
we would cancel membership in
the conference as of September
1963.

President Collins accepted the
recommendations of the board.

On April 4, 1963. the SUNYAC‘
accepted the proposed revisions
and were informed of our cancel—
lation of membership.

Threefold Effect:

The effects of this cancellation
of membership on Albany’s inter-
collegiate program will be:

(I) No visible change in our
current scheduled opponents.

(2) No chance of playing in the
conference basketball tournament.

(3) No possible restrictions of
scheduling of opponents whom we
might wish in the near future.

Spinning the 7
Sports Wheel

f

included in next year’s athletic budget, which has
an open hearing before the student body May 3, there
are two simple lines of print. What they represent is
perhaps the most significant thing ever to happen to
State athletics. They read:

Travel 4 men, l500
miles each, $540

Assuming that they are buried away in some musty,
long-forgotten files, one could scour old athletic budgets
from the year one onward, and never, no never, would
the word recruitment venture to appear. Well, it
still doesn’t.

But then, like Bill Shakespeare said about calling
roses names, recruitment by any other name is still
recruitment. Replace the word travel with the forbid-
den word recruitment, and you have the essence of the
two lines printed above.

As a matter of fact, in the original draft of the
budget recruitment was given a brief moment of glory,
and actually allowed to appear in print. But the powers
that be felt it was a “dirty” word, perhaps reminiscent
of Cincinnati or Ohio State. Well anyhow this bureau—
cratic trivia isn’t important. What counts is that funds
have been alloted for recruitment (excuse us, we mean
travel, of course) for the first time in State’s athletic
history.

Tremendous Change

The Athletic Board’s decision to make provisions for
some recruitment funds then marks a distinct change
in the order of State athletics. This is not to say that
State’s coaches have not used all the charm, wit, and
ingenuity at their disposal to cajole some of State’s
fine non-scholarship athletes to our campi in the past.

While performing this necessary task, however,
State coaches have never been paid for their pains.
Any money they might spend in pursuing some promis—
ing high school athlete came from their own pockets.
The new recruitment provision now changes this
ridiculous state of affairs. State’s coaches are now
allowed to spend $540 while floating around the state
looking for the future stars of the Albany playing fields.

This change, of course, is long overdo and heartily
welcomed. Recruiting in college today is at a higher
pitch than it has ever been before, A good high school
athlete is worth his weight in gold to many coaches.
in the future the competition for athletes will only gct
tighter and tighter.

Albany State, however, has failed to keep pace with
the times. indeed, it would be no exaggeration to say
that State is behind the recruitment standards of 1890.
As a matter of fact, Frank Merriwoathcr himself would
find it impossible to get any sort of assistance for
playing sports at State.

While pcrsuing New York’s gilded athletes, Albany’s
coaches must go forth with cmpty hands. About the only
thing they can offc r is a job in the. Student Union (in the
off—season, of course) atzibuckun hour. With conditions

like this, sports fans, you may rest nssurcdno whisper
of scandal will ever touch the. sacred hind of Minerva.

Non-Scholarship Future Bleak

An uprightcous system like this is ccrlninly to bc
commended. Unfortumiioly, it does h:th one little
drawback. it sure isn’t condusiyc to procuring good
athletes. Albany has been lucky in the past. \\'c how
some. truly outstanding athletes in our varsity ranks
today. llut what about tomorrow? We are living on
borrowed time, The failure of this year’s freshmen
teams is indicitivo of this.

The situation will not improve by itself, If Slzllc’s
athletic program is to keep pace with the expected
growth of the university, thou provisions must be made
to insure getting better athletes. it is for this reason
that we Welcome the af'oremontionml $540 for recruit~
mont travel.

We can only hope that this revolutionary measure
established the setting of a firm precodent on which
State’s athletic future can be built. li‘rom it, we hope
a comprehensive scholarship—aid athletic program will
build, which will be worthy of a universityof ton thous—
and. lt is not an exaggeration to say that the $540
alloted for travel in next year’s budget, dollar for dol-
lar is the best spent money ever used on State ath—
letics. it is a big step in the right direction.

Stale Stlulenls Organize Booster

The Athletic llcpn rlmcnt has uu—
listed a program forthc promotion
of sports participation andin—
creased school spirit, 'i‘hc team
coaches met With interested stud»
ents last Week to help formulaic
plans for a new ilrmstert‘ampmgn

The coaches, realizing the im-
portance of spectator participation
to the players, hope that the cam~
paign will produce solid results.

The main purpose of the Hoos-
ters is to get peophi out to the
many athletic events which take
place yea rly at State. The Hoosiers
feel that attendance at games has
been very poor this year.

For example. at last Saturday's

baseball opener, on ll-Il victory,
there Were hardly enough people to
fill the bleachers. This Is for rc—
moved from chn minimum school
spirit.

The Hoosiers (‘lub, headed by
Steve (‘urti and fill! Laundry, has
formulated a central body from
which it will work. Representatives
have been chosen from the dormi-
tories, fraternities. so ro r i 1 ie 3,
and group houses.

However, even more help is
needed if the program is to be a
success. Anyone interested in
joining this worthwhile organiza-
tion should contact eitbc r M r. (‘urti
or Mr Laundry by Student Mail.

HITTING 8: PITOHINO LOOK SHARP
AS STATE VARSITY ROUTS RIT 11-3

State’s varisty baseball squad got its 1963 campaign off toarousing start
last Saturday, overwhelming an outmatched Rochester Institute of Technology

(RIT) team 11-3.

The Peds outplayed the losing RIT squad in all departments.

This game marked the first time in a numberofyears that the Peds

 

Bedecked in her well—worn baseball cap, Mrs. Eggleston, State's
own "Mrs. Baseball," throws out the first ball in Saturday’s dio-
mond opener.

opened the season at home.

As things go in State base-
ball, a fairly good crowd turned
out to witness the Peds’ debut.
About 400 fans were at hand at
the start, and consideringthe cold,
blustery winds that swept the play-
ing field their numbers did not
dwindle too rapidly.

Mn. Eggleston Starts

Once again. Mrs. Eggleston was
the first “pitcher” to take the
mound for State. The Dean of
Albany State baseball kept her
unmarrcd earned run average in-
tact as she fired (underhand) the
first ball of the 1963 season into
catcher 'l‘ony Maculuso.

Senior co—captain (lary Penfield
had accompanied Mrs. Egglcston
to the mound.

With a successful opener under
their belts, and what promised to
be a good game with Siena \\’ed—

pearance will be next Tuesday.
when they take on (inconta at 4:00
p.m. on the playing field.

Pitching Clicks

in last Saturday’s opener. the
combination of Ray Week‘s ex-
cellent pitching and some timely
hitting proved too much for RiT.

Weeks turned in one ofthe finest
mound performances to be seen
at State in a long while. Coach
Burlingame doubted he could go the
route, but after a shakey start he
settled down to blank RIT over the
last seven innings.

Weeks was tagged for three
earned runs in the first two in-
nings before getting the losers
number. in going the distance be
yielded just six hits (four in the

first two frames) while fanning
eight.
Weeks' most effective pitch

seemed to be his off-speed ball
which had the RIT diamondmen
swinging at air all afternoon.

Hitting Sharp

The Pod hitting looked sharp
in this one, as they massaged the
MIT pitcher for twvlvc hits. Fit—
tingly enough, the first safety of
the 1963 season was blasted by
i’cnfield, a tremendous 340 foot
bell over the left field fence.

The game was really over in the
third inning, when the Peds rallied
for fth' runs to go ahead for keeps
8-3, Nine i’eds came to the plate
in this frame to ice the game.
