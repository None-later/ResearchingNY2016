Faculty Ignore Responsibilities

When we entered college, we were led to believe that
life at Albany State was essentially a two way street
on which faculty and students would work hand in hand
in securing the benefits of a higher education. Of late,
it seems that many ofour faculty members have strayed
off this primrose path.

The entire university has been put undera strain this
past year with the addition of the new annexes. The old
policy of allowing just ten minutes between classes has
been maintained. Even under ideal conditions, this
allows just abare minimum to get from the main campus
to the outlying annexes.

Many of our faculty have failed to provide even this
bare minimum. Many professors think nothing of run-
ning their classes three, four, or even five minutes over
their alloted time. This makes it very difficult, if not
impossible, for students to arrive at theirother classes
on time. It is hard on the students’ lungs. It disrupts
other classes with students coming in late. In short,
it is self—centered and thoughtless.

In addition to this, many professors think nothing of
running their classes eight, nine, or ten weeks before
bothering to give a mark. Many take as long as four
weeks to return a test. This does not give their students
a fair chance. If they are unable to handle a course,
by the time they have received a grade, it is too late
to drop out.

We realize that the brunt of responsibility during
college rests with the students. But we also claim that
the faculty has certain obligations toward the students.
All too often, some of our faculty have ignored their
responsibilities.

link You, Senate

On behalf of the entire NEWS staff and News Board,
we would like to sincerely thank Senate for approving
our budget including the line for an Editor’s salary of
$400 per year.

We have been trying to obtain this objective during
the last three years and we are glad that Senate
looked to the future and realized its practicality and
necessity.

l Communication 

Wieboldt Asks For
Careful Reporting

To the Editor.

Your .\pril 19th editorial ex-
plaining the S. U. News position on
the criticism leveled in the MY-
SK.\.\'l.\ petitions was an abnega-
tlon of honored journalistic re-
sponsihility.

The absence ofstudentcriticism
of this bland denial of function is
perhaps more significant than the
monstrous situation itself.

First, no responsible newspaper
editorializes on news it has failed
to print. Did not the S. U. Now: run
an editorial entitled “Cortland -
Victory?" on the front page of the
March 8 issue?

A straight news story dealing
with this matter did not appear
anywhere in that issue or in sub—
sequent issues until the petitions
were distributed. lf theS. U. Now:
didn’t have enough news to run a
hard news story. did it then have
enough to base an editorial"

in this case. the News acted as

a rumor-creating agency —~ just
the role it wished to disclaim on
April 19.

The editorial of April 19 stated
“we do not feel any obligation to
run around listening to half truths
and rumors."

“hat then is reporting? Does
not the New York Times, pillar of
journalistic responsibility, inves-
tigate rumors of impending im-
portance. or shouldn‘t one indulge
in mock-heroic comparisons"

\thn the “editor” disclaimsthe
right to “rival or hamper judicial
process" he is sanctioning public
ignorance of said process or in-
viting public abuse of it.

The newspapc r,
watchdog or its elected represen-
tatives, serves an integral function
in a democratic society — t‘\’t'n in
:i powerless student democracy.

it is criminal for our chief pub—
lication to rcjt‘t‘l its duty to iri—
vi-stigtitc t'\'t‘n the most respect—

the judiciary.

STATE UNIVERSITY NEWS. FRIDAY. MAY 3. 1963 PAGE 3

 

  

Independent on News Board All And suppression lo Provide Week’s fnterlainmeot;
Plays Should Prove in Be Varied And Also Exciting

Expresses Views on Greeks

The announcements of the committee investigating
fraternities and sororities are expected to be finished
sometime next week.

As an independent who is on News Board and in
Student Senate, i feel i must state a few of my Views
on fraternities and sororities and the committee.

Committees are usually formed to solve a problem.
I ask — how can a problem be solved unless it exists?
Why is a committee set up without any noticeable con—
sultation with student leaders? Why was only one cur—
rent student included on the entire committee?

i feel it means next to nothing to include people who
attended years ago and were members ofour Greeks as
they existed years ago.

The problems. if any, are in the present and in the
future.

Administration's Concern Questioned

Why should the administration or anyone have any
quarrel with the existence of organized social groups
if they are not interruptingthe conirolofthe University.
The proviso here is that there are individuals who wish
to form or continue such groups.

\\hy should the administration or anyone else have
any quarrel with a group unless it interferes with
administratimi’?

Secrecy Discussed

The only questions that canbc raised about (ireeks are
that they are secret and that they rciccl people thereby
hurting some. supposedly.

(irecks Lll‘t‘ not the only soci'ct groups on campus.
MYSK.\Y\'l.\ is somewhat secret. l'Ivr-ry honorary with—
out cxcoptioiLhiis some secret — a handshake, ii slogan,
etc.

i have nothing" against it group which just so happens
to be somewhat secret. My i'clig'ion has no qualms
about the type of (trucks we have at State.

Maturity Involved

The only oilict‘ poiiil which can be made is that llic
(irccks do not :icci-pi everyone who attempts to join.
This point is all together invalid.

\\'iicn soniconc runs for oi'i‘icc, if ho or she is un—

by Harry Guy

in the next five days, a total of
seven plays will be presented sep-
arately by the Advanced Dramatics
Class and suppression.

The suppression plays will be
presented Saturday. May 4, at
2:30 and 8:30 p.m. and Sunday.
May 5, at 2:30 p.m. in the Ken-
more Hotel.

'l‘he Al) plays will be presented
Monday through Wednesday, May
6, 7, and 8 at 7:30 p.m. in Rich—
ardson 291.

4 Plays by AD Players

The Al) (‘lass will present Wil-
liam Saroyan‘s “Hello OutThere"
directed by Myra Levine ‘63. as—
sislcd by Sharon House ‘64, Check-
ov‘s “A Marriage Proposal" di-
rected by Brenda Smith '64. as-
sisted by Shari Townsend'64. Lady
(l rc go ry' s “The Rising of the
Moon" directed by Frank Rycrson
’64, assisted by Judith (ihinger’66.
and Robert Greene‘s “Eliza and
the Lexicon" directed by (‘on-
stance .\melio '64. assisted by
Robe rt Willower ‘64.

suppression will sponsor lones—

co’s “The Chairs," Tad Mosal's

“impromptu.” and Sean O’Casey's
“The Bedtime Story."

Each of the plays is unique. and
combined they encompass allcate—
gories of the drama — from farce
to modern tragedy.

Themes

The \l) pluvs are student di-
rectorl and the selection of plays
this time is excellent. “llr-llo
(tut There" is a nostalgic. mov-
ing. and didactic play about a
trump (Nathan Puckett '64) accused
of rape and his effect on a young
girl (Jo \\'est '66.)

“.\ Marriage Proposal" is a
farce which traces the hilarious
complications when a proud hypo—
condriac (Jon Harden ‘65) pro—
poses marriage to a sex—starved
woman (\‘allery (iolom ’64) through
her old father (George Norton'66.)

"The Rising of the Moon" deals
with an lrish revolution and its
quietly comic effect on some men
(Charles Powers '66. Donald (‘os—
tcllo ‘63. Robert Peterson '66,and
Jan l)yckm:in ‘20,)

The final play. “i-Iliza and the
Lexicon" is :1 drama about two
girls (Mary Hotter '65 and Lillian

Schmidt '64) and a young boy's
(Dennis Tuttle ‘65) entry into the
occult.

The suppression plays seem to
be an annual event to supplement
their literary creativity with dra-
matic creativity. These plays are
also fine selections.

“Impromptu” attempts through
its four characters to delineate
between illusion and reality.

“The Chairs." an absurd drama,
depicts a man who desires success
but instead finds only failure and
disillusionment.

“The Bedtime Story" is a mel-
ancholic tale interspiced with some
typically lrish humor.

These plays should not be
missed. The entertainmentprom—
ised is varied and exciting. Both
suppression and AD plays are
free — first come. first seated —
and both include important dra-
matic productions.

For those new at theatrical fic-
tion. this is a chance to become
acquainted with the various move-
ments in the theatre: and it also
is a great opportunity for anyone
who desires good entertainment.
