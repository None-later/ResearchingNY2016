‘lhe lin Ilium,’ Crass’ latest Novel Abounds
In Fascinating Character, Bawdy Humor, And Satire

by J. A. Genie:
The Tin Drum by Gunther 6rau(595pp)
NewYorlr: Pantheon Books. 36.95.

The question as towhetheror not
Gunther (irass' novel. The Tin Drum
is the best German novel since
Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain
is unimportant and somewhat rid—
iculous. \hhat is important is the
fact that fiuntherfirass has written
a bawdy. biting. blasphemous. and
brilliant novei.

Thirty year old ()skar Matzer-
ath. the strange. grotesque heroof
the novel. gives the reader an
epic—like account of his life from
his birth to his present condition
- an inmate of a mental hospital.

Rebel: Against Society

()skar was born with an adult
mind. and from the moment of his
birth. he rebels against his par-
ents and the society around him.
At the age of three. he decides to
stop growing. “To avoid the cash
register I clung to my drum and
from my third birthday on refused
to grow by so much as a finger's
breadth."

With his rlrum and glass shatter—
ing voice. ()skar confronts and un—
dermines the world around him.
From under the skat table. he
sees his mother and her lover
playing “footsie”. From under a
Nazi propaganda rostrum. he
drums up waltzes which throw
mass meetings into utter con—
fusion.

0skar has nothing to do with
creation: his only occupation is
destruction. "Yes. my work was
destructive. .\nd what I did not
defeat with my drum. I killed with
my voice."

An Absurd World

Although he denied the analogy.
Oskar is a dwarfed Odysseus who
possesses consta nt shrewdness
and crafty tact. ()skar. however,
lacks the bravery and nobility of
this ancient hero. He isan absurd.
deformed man in an absurd. de-
formed world.

It is a world in which a fisher-
man attempts to catch eels with a
horse’s head and a long rope; in
which an oblique pill-box formation
entitled “Barbaric. Mystical.
Bored” becomes the artistic rep-
resentation of the tWentieth cen-
tury; and in which a nation believes
in Santa Claus (Hitler). “But
Santa Claus was really the gas-
man."

.\s the novel progresses. ()s-
kar's rebellion sours into moral
ruthlessness. He is, in part.
responsible for the death of his

mother. his father. and his pre-
sumed father. As his guilt grows.
his body also grows. In a few
short months. ()skar grows over
a foot. He also develops a hunch-
back.

Sometimes the guilt is so over-
powering that he makes some al-
lowance by pleading ignorance —
“the ignorance which came into
style in those years and which
even today quite a few of our
citizens wear like a jaunty and.
oh. so becoming little hat."

“Black Witch" Motif

The motif of the "Black “itch”
rtrns throughout the novel. This
image. taken from it child's song.
becomes a major unifying factor.
It also serves as the prime sym-
irol of (irass' accusations against
the reader anti all of mankind.

“\\here’s the \l’itch. black as
pitch'.’ Here‘s the black wicked
Witch. Ha. ha. ha! You're to
blame. .\nd you are too. You're
most to blame. You! you! you!"

Little ()skar also sees himself
as Christ. He possesses the same
features “which can arouse en-
thusiasm but not convince." He
arouses the support of a group of
wild youths and proclaims a way
of rebellion againstthe established
order.

The parallel swings ftrll cycle
when ()skar is sentenced to the
asylum for a murder which he
did not commit. ()skar may not
be the Christ we deserve. but he
is the Christ we have receiver].

The Tin Drum abounds in bawdy
humor and grotesque character-
ization. Not since the works of
Dostoevesky have so many strange
and perversely fascinating char—
acters found their way into the
pages of a single novel.

Stylistically speaking. the novel
is a tour tle force for (lrass.
Third person shifts into first:
word play is found th roughout; sec—
tions written in the stream ofcon-
sciousness technique appear; and
even a section written in play
form is used.

Above all, however. The Tin Drum
is a satire. On whom? Everyone.

even be a satire on himself. Both

exaggerate.

Probably not, but even if he were a

Calu Examines Assemblyman Carlino’s Comparison
tit National Economy And Pay-As-You-Co Plan

by Joseph W. Galu

.-\ recent article in the Knick
News by .-\rvis Chalmers pointed
out the fact that New York State
has one of the lowest rates of
economic growth of any state inthe
union.

In drawing his information from
Business Week magazine. Chal—
mers noted that New York's rate
of growth is 4.3'.’ for the first 11
months of 1962. This compares
with 6.4"/ which was the ratcofthc
entire nation.

44 States have faster rates of
growth than New York. 0iin Iowa.
.\Iassachusctts. West Virginia. and
Hawaii are growing more slowly
than New York.

I find it interesting to use this
information as it background for
consiilcriirg sonic rcci-iit state-
mcnts by Republican leaders.

leaders of the ruling party could
admit the facts. even ifthcy cannot
be objective.
[Perhaps I should pause
hero to state my belief
that pure objectivity
does not exist. Ibelievc
that there are only
varying forms of sub—
jectivity. The goal of
Carlino, ct al, and my
goal should be the
same — the miitimtrmi—
zation of subjectivity]

It is about time people stopped
pretending that pa—ris-you—go is
anything more than it political
slogan.

Political Aim
Tbc statements by (‘rtrlino, who
is commonly referred to rts one of
liockcfcllcr's closest (‘0llfitlillllS.
.‘ll‘t‘ rather convincing arguments
that the current state regime has
t‘\'t'l'\’ intention of dorngevcrything

possible to protect its sacred cow—
pay—as-you-go.

Carlino is nowhere near unin—
tclligent enough to think that his

statements about the sagging level
of the national economy are ac—
currttc or factual.

His statements show how far
partisan glee can stretchthe facts.

Levitt Has Lost Ward

While the Republican lcade rs are
claiming that the state is paying
its bills out of current monies.
the Comptroller of the state.
.\rthur Levitt (it Democratlpointed
out that the state had to issue
several hundred thousand dollars
worth of bonds last month inorder
to meet mriiidrttcd expenditures.

These facts togcthci‘ with many
otlicrs convince me that pay—as—
voir~gu is something of .t frrttrd
with the critirc sttttc being the
victim.
