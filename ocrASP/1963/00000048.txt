STATE UNIVERSITY NEWS. FRIDAY.

 

Spinning the ,
Sports Wheel 

 

 

by Bill Colgan "

Having shot the wad of our multitudinous and mag-
nanamous writing talents on yon story about our friend-
ly neighbors on the sandbar, we are not overly desirous
of writing this equally magnitudinous sports type col—
umn. But having already killed five lines worth of
space, we will just sort of wonder on until we’ve
reached the end of the trail. And there go Roy and
Dale around the bend. Whoa Trigger!

Basically, sports fans, we’ve more or less gone
out of our minds. Play your guitar, Gene. No. no we
can’t be cracking up. Whatever you do in life sports
fans, never become a sports writer — especially in
Albany. “The rain in Albany mainly gives you a pain.”

Last Tuesday we had three varsity sports scheduled.
Since Tuesday night is deadline on this wild and wooly
newspaper, we left mucho (that’s Spanish for much)
room for said games in our magnanimous sports sec—
tion. So, when we arise filled with vim and vigor on
said Tuesday, we are greeted by the sight of a mod—
erate typhoon lashing its way across our beloved campi.

We more or less panic at this sight, having nothing
better to do. But, by a monumental effort involving our
magnitudinous skills, we fill the sports section anyhow.

Now, as we sit here Monday night, we ask you,
what’s the odds of history repeating (in public no less).
Tomorrow we have home games scheduled in baseball
and tennis. Again we leave mucho room. And again,
it’s supposed to rain.

We have this bit of information on no less of an
authority than John Sturtevant, who lookedquite sportsy
surrounded by dirty linen in the Waterbury laundry room,
that it will rain tomorrow. If it rains tomorrow, rest
assured, it will be “High Ho Silver and Away” for us.

 

Sigma Awha ape
WAA Cage Lap
Slate Awards Nile

Sigma Alpha again takes the has-
ketball championship as they
swamped Psi Gamma in an exciting
game this past Tuesday. Pat Mc-
Dowell was high scorer for Sigma
Alpha. This game brought to an
end the active, but prolonged, bas—
ketball season.

The women’s softball team of
Brubacher Hall met the Commuters’
team on Monday. April 26. for the
first official game of the Monday-
Tuesday league. Brubacher
swamped the Commuters'. winning
by a score of 26-9. On Tuesday. the
Gamma Kap-Kappa Delta game was
postponed because of rain.

In the Wednesday-Thursday cir—
cuit. Beta Zeta met Chi Sig [I on
Wednesday and Sayles met Alden
yesterday. Today the'Sigma Alpha
Sig Phi games which were resched-
uled will be played.

This Monday Chi Sig will play
Phi Delta. and on Wednesday Psi
Gamma will play the winner of the
Sayles-Alden game. The managers
also wish to emphasize the fact
that if any of the teams forfeit
one game they will be eliminated
from the league.

Awards Banquet

.\largie Tucker. chairman of the
.\wards Banquet, reports that plans
are well underway for the dinner
which will be held this April 18.
it is hoped that all girlswill support
the \\'..\..\. by attending thebanquet.
At a later date. information con-
cerning reservations will be avail—
able.

   
   

State linlismen iopple New Paltz
For 2nd Straight Victory In Rain

in a cold, clammy day that would
have sent Satan scurrying for his
Windbreaker, the State golf team
retained its undefeated status last
Wednesday by downing New Paltz
5 1/2 — 3 1/2.

The deciding point was producod
by some Clutch play from the two—
some of Captain Bill Nelson and
Paul Baehorz.

In the waning minutes of a misty
twilight, Bachorz fought back from
a four point deficit to pull out a
12—1 victory. The twosome also
combined for an additional 1/2
point in the best ball match to pad
the win.

Vertiak Wins

Doug Morgan and Vertiak were
the big winners coming through
with all their points in the match.

Vertiak registered his second
straight triumph of the season.
while. Morgan notched his initial
victory.

.\‘cw I’altz's number one man
shot an exceptional 76 to win

medalist honors and to send Fred
Mauer down to a crushing 4-3
defeat.

Strouburg Rallies

Bob Strauburg played in impres—
sive fashion in his inaugural var—
5in match. llis rally proved to br-
pivotal by coming from two down
with five holes to play.

The golf team now stands with
two victories and no defeats and
is off and winging in what prom—
ises to be its most successful
season cvci‘.

AMIA Softball Opens
With “Football” Scores

The .\ .\ll.\ softball season got un—
derway this week, but judging from
the first games. it seems more like
a continuation of .\lll.\ basketballor
football.

In the first three “contests” .\P.\
barely eekcd out a 24-4 victory over
SLS, the Goobers just managed to
top the Infinites 9—7, and Waterbury
got involved in a real pitchers duel
with KB. winning by a scant lR—l-t
margin.

ADELPHI COACH DEMANDS SATISFACTION FOR FORFEIT

    

PAGE 7

iaherty Threatens To Break Relations With State;
Feb. 2 Incident Could Effect School’s Reputation

by Bill Colgan, Sports Editor

.\n old specter arose recently to
haunt Albany State in the form of
charges leveled against .\lbany by
.\delphi College for the result of
the basketball game played between
the two schools this last February.

.\s of Monday afternoon. George
Faherty. director of athletics and
basketball coach at .\delphi, was
seriously considering asking the
\delphi administration to bring
Il’lt‘ matter of the disputed basket-
ball game before the State i-Tduca-
lion Department.

\t the moment it is unclear just
what jurisdiction. if any. the State
l-idiication Department has in a
matter of this nature.

Thi- gamc in questionwasplayed
in the \\'ashingtoii .\rmoiwoyei‘thc
intwr—svmesti-i‘ break. and re-
sulth in \delphi walking off thi-
court and forfeiting the game to
State.

The contest had been marked by
unusual roughness on both sides,
and s t‘ yo l‘dl fights had llo .i i‘lv
i'i‘tlplml.

Investigation

This information was gathered
by this reporter in .i telephone in—
It‘l‘\'lt’\\' with I“.lllt‘l‘l\' last .\loiiday.

ThH mat to r had been fi rst
brought the attention of the
S. U. News Norman Scidclman

Seidelman conducted his inter-
view only as an interested State
student. not as a representative of
the S. U. News or any other organi-
zation.

However. upon considering what
he had learned. Seidelman felt it
best to bring everything he knew
to the attention of the S. U. ans.

In his interview, Seidelman dis-
covered that .\delphi did not con-
sider the case a dead issuc. and
was planning to bring the issue
before the State Education Depa rt-
merit.

In this reporter‘s intr-ryiewwrth
I’ahe rty Monday. the \delphi athle~
tic director was not explicit as
this, and said only that he was con-
Sidcring asking his college‘s ad-
ministration to lay the case before
the State Education Department.

Fahcrtv said that he rlid not have
any power in this matter. and
could only request the \delphi ad—
ministration to act.

When asked if he planned to fol—
low this course of action. Fahertv
hedged and said that it was being
considered.

“hen asked what the probabili-
ties were of him asking his ad—
ministration, he re 1 te ra t u d his
previous statement and said only
that it was being considered

The source went on to say that
Adelphi has impartial support for
its charges. He said that five
coaches were in the stands watch-
ing the game.

“hen the game was over, the
source said all five went to the
.\delphi dressing room and said
they agreed with .\delphi‘s ac-
tion. The names of the five were
withheld, but Dan Cunha of Siena
was mentioned.

Investigation Doubttul

If the State Education Depart-
ment is brought into the case, it
is doubtful just what action it
would be able to undertake

When Seidelman asked what
\rlelphi hoped to accomplish by
an action of this sort, the source
stated, “We hope they'll clean
house at \lbany <tate." .\o ex-
planation of this statement was
made,

.\t the moment only one thing
is clear—the attitude at .\delphi
toward .\lbany State is one ofgreat
anger.

\delphi has decided to sever all
relations with State. This means
that next fall‘s scheduled soccer
game will not be played.

\delphi will refuse all dealings
with \‘taie for at least fouryears—
until every active athlete at \lbany
this year has graduated.

.\delphi feels that this will
greatly injure Albany’s reputation
among Long Island colleges.
