HOW TO SEE EUROPE
FOR ONLY $300 A DAY: NO. 2

Last week we discussed England, the ﬁrst stop on the tour of
Europe that every American eollege student is going to make
this summer. Today we will take up your next stop ~1”rance,
or the l’earl of the Pacific, as it is generally called.

To get from England to France, one greases one's body and
swims the English Channel. Similarly, to get from France to
Spain, one gr aises one's body and slides down the Pyrenees.
And, of course, to get from France to Switzerland, one grease~
one's body and wriggles through the Siniplon Tunnel. Thus, as
you can see, the most important single item to take to Europe
's a valise full of gr ‘ase.

No, I am wrong. The most important thing to take to Europe
a \‘alise full of Marlboro ('igarettes or at lt':i>t as many a~

Student Compiled Course Guide
Describes Reactions To Subjects

try Joseph V. Gala

The long awaited, much discus-
sed and much feared course guide
arrived last Monday morning. The
guide outlines each course offered
last fall and includes comments on
the courses and instructors.

The first 500 luck people re—
ceived the only copies of the pre-
cious document. The guide ran 40
pages.

The idea of the guide was con-
ceivcd by Howard Berkun ‘6-1. He
was aided in his efforts primarily
by Hamid Szcnes '64.

Last Sunday the entire booklet
was mimeographed. The effort
begun at 9: 00 am. and did not end
until sometime in the morningof
the next day. 11v that time there
\vere several others iiiiliiigl1erkun
and Szenes.

Financed by Student Funds
Szcnes and l1erkun appcaredbe-
fore Senate and attempted to ex-
plain their purposes. \ second
appearance before Senate saw the
appropriation passed.

The guide received tiiiancial
support 111 the form of $30 from
Student Senate. The award of the
was preceded by .1 ll\“'l\'
debate. The vote in favor of tlilS
new idea for “115‘ campus was
overwhelmingly iii f.i\‘rii'.

nitiltt‘\'

\ Senate committee headed by
Senator Mary Margaret \\c1kcr'6:3
was placed iii charge of the ek—
peiiditure of the funds. The rea—
son for this was the lack of con—
stitution of the group spending the
money.

The actual money for the coni—
notice was appropriated in a spe—
cial session of finance committee
chaired by Senator Barbara Town-

send '65.

Procedure

The work on the guide began
with a mimeographed question—
naire which was distributed in the
dorms and to several group and
1reek houses. Students filled in
the information about the courses
they took last semester.

The questionnaires which were
returned were first torn apart and
classified into area fields. After
this, there was a division by in-
dividuat courses and individual i11—
structors.

The courses were evaluated in-
dividually by a person unconnected
with the particular fieldundercon-
sidcration. '1‘1iiswasdoi1etoassure
freedom from bias.

Validity Sought

No course was evaluated unless
three carefully written replies
\vere reCeiVed.

The intent of the guide was to
cover all courses outside the re—
quired education courses. This
goal was not reached due to a
poor return percentage, This
lacking is especially apparent on
the graduate level.

The reaction by students and
most faculty hasbeenenthusiastic.
The only complaints have been the
inability to rate all courses and
the low number of replies used to
rate some courses.

.\11 instructors were treated iii
a manner the writers considered
to be “gentle.”

All copies of the
distributed in a matter

guide were
of .‘1 few

The guide is now being used by
hundreds of grateful students as
they work on pre—registration.
