WSUA To Continue to Inform

And to Entertain

by Nicli Argyros, Station Manager

\V‘SUA, .\lbany State’s own radio
station. a long—awaited dream. has
become a functioning reality.
Through the efforts of Bill .\lcx—
ander '64, Don .\llen '63. and Dr.
Anthony Salatino. WSI'A went on
the air Feb. 22.

The \VSUA staff has since main~
tained the original purpose of the
\\'SUA Constitution: to contribute
more effective communication to
the student body by broadcasting
musical entertainment and useful
information of. for. and by State
students.

This policy will be upheld. in~
creasing the special events pro—
gramming and expandinginto other
features of special student in—

te rest.
Poll Planned

A student poll taken in the near
future will determine the time and
types of musical programming
preferred by the quad residents.

For the remainder of this se~
mester, the programming will re-
main as it has been in the past:
the hours of 6-8 p.m. will hear
pops music: 8—9 folk music and
show music; 9—10 mood music;
10-11 classics. Special State 1'.
News time will be at 6:55 and 11
p.m.

The frustrations of growing
pains have plagued \\’St',\ :1” Vt'tit‘
A major problem for the radio
broadcasters has been finding :i
source of records. This problem
will be alleviated next year when
WSI'A will start building its own
private record collection financed
by Student Senate.

Of Hopes, Fmstrations, &Delays To Prepare and Present Programs

lntcrcst in radio broadcasting
began at State in the late 40's. \
Radio (‘ouncil was organized as .i
means of "informing the public of
the work of college andcommumty
organizations." and to “provide
radio expcriencc for students."

Radio (‘ouncil hoped to expand
college radio facilities. but ideas
came and went. and frustrations
came and stayed.

During the ‘50's. new ideas arose
and polls were taken. but nothing
constructive resulted.

Actions Begun
Hut in 196'). the newly revit.ili7.i-d
('ollcgc Radio Station ('omiiiittec.
headed by acting Station \l.in.igi'r
llill .\lexandei‘ ‘64. took steps
toward obtaining :i student owned
and operated station.

 
   

This movement was highlighted
by a poll distributed toall students
living in the quad. The poll inquired
of tastes in music and listening
times. Station policy was formu—
lated around the results of this
poll.

Former Aclieivements; Plot lacking

J. A. Gomez
The Home on the Hill by Cesare Pavexe
(I92 pp)—Walker 8 Co., New York, $3.95

Like many modern Italian writ-
ers. Cesare Pavese often deals
with themes centering on politics
and nostalgia for the land. But un-
like many modern Italian writers.
he develops his works with a con-
trolled restraint which provides
subtlety and significant underlying
meaning.

His novels are often thinly plot-
ted. and his strength as a writer
rests with his characterization and
technical mastery. .\lthough his
characters often lack the great
on m pe l l i n g stature of Siione‘s
heroes. they are still remembered
by most critical readers. They
are less glorious. but they are
more intricately developed.

Sterile Life in Teacher

Such an example is Corrado. the
wavering. middle-aged school
tcachcr. in The House on the Hill.
Corrado lives in a small house.
outside the war—torn city ofTurin.
with a widow and her unmarried
daughter, Elvira.

Elvira is husband hunting. but
Corrado is not ready to commit
himself to anyone. He is a man
who has betrayed women and who
has been betrayed by them inturn.
An especially unhappy and tragic
affair has led him to turn against
life.

“Rut I lost my enthusiasm for
science, for Society and for sci-
entific institute..,.\s the war did
not happen that year (I still had
faith that the war would settle
something) i applied for a post as
a teacher and began my present
way of life." (‘orrado's present
way of life is non-committal ster—
ility.

Sympathetic but irresponsible

()nc night. however. he meets
Cate. a former lover. and learns
that she has a son. He suspects
that the boy is his son. and he
seeks to regain some contact with
the woman. The relationship is
not romantically inclined,but(‘or—
l‘titlt) still shows a great concern
for her and the boy.

Yet he still remainsanirrespon-
sible being who is unable to solidify
thc relationship. Ilc lacks the cour-
age to commit himSelf to life.
“Then after you are dead — if
you‘re lucky « you may become
someone."

After (‘atc's capture bythciicr—

mans. he again shows his irrc~
syxnisible lack of courage, Ilc
turns his back on (‘atc's son.

Dino. and flees in order to save
himself.

Dino'oCoura'e

Dino does not desire to hide:
he desires to join his countrymen
in the mountains. Finally. he does
so and passes out of Corrado's
life forever.

it is only after the journey to
his father‘s land that Corrado
begins to become someone. The
vine-covered earth serves as the
symbolic agent of his transfor-
mation. His resurrection is a bit
too hasty. but it is quite genuine.
“.\nd the day will come when no
one will be outside the war -— not
even the coward. the despairing.
the recluse....\\'e must all consent
to take part in the war and then
perhaps we shall have peace."

Novel Found Locking

Stylistically speaking. Pavese Is
not at his best in The House on the
Hill. He fails to achieve the degree
of brilliance that he reached in
The Moon and the Bonfire: and The
Devil in die Hillu. The novel has its
moments. but it is hindered by the
episodic structure and the overly
rapid transformation of the hero.

ciously supplied this book for re-

Payese’s Latest Novel fans Bemw Newly Formed Downtown Players Present 3 Plays;
Suppression Sponsored Productions tiood In All Days

by Harry Guy

Last weekend suppressﬂ pre-
sented the newly formed Downtown
Players in a group of one-act
plays. The plays were presented at
the Kenmore Hotel's Rain—Bo
Room. which looks like a dissi—
pated set from “Walk on the Wild
Side.”

Situated only a few seats from
the stage was an open bar. .\mid
this general hub—bub of drunken
shouts. smashing bottles. laugh-
ing. smoking. ringing cash reg—
ister. and a half—potted audience.
suppression presented one of the
best dramatic productions of the
year.

"Bedtime Story" First

Sean (t'Ciiscy's "Bedtime Sto-
ry" opened the bill. This play
is a direct reversal of the typical
sex farce: here the hero. Mulli—
gan (Kenneth Smith). instead of
trying to bed .\ngela (Brenda Cas—
well). is trying to be rid of her.

Hilarious complications arise
when he attempts to hide .\ngcla
from his nosey landlady (Norma
Kuthr) and his frican Halibut
(William Gardner).

The landlady thinks he is crazy
and brings in a nurse. a cop. and
a doctor for a rousing finale. The
roles were played to perfection
by everyone and their bubbling
humor captured the peculiar (laelic

flavor and gait.
The bouncing rhythm neve r
stopped: the show was excellent.

Illusion or Realty

Tad Mosel‘s “Impromtu” was a
PirandelIo—Iike play. it discussed
the relation between illusion and
reality.

Four actors were on stage —
sent by the stage manager to im-
provise a play — and they weren't
able to leave until they had enacted
something acceptable to the stage
manager.

Finally. when all pretenses were
gone. the actors showed their real
selves. and as true life on stage
has been realized. the lights dim.
Their play had meaning and now
fades into memory: the play dims
out and is just a call in the dark.

In the role of the hard-hitting.
middle-aged actress. .\rlccn I-Im—
cry was exciting and moving: as
the conceited actor, Max Hrous—
sard was professionally skillful:
\\'endy .\‘iidlcr was sincere in the
girl—next—door role: Michael l'lick
as the intense young man search—
ing for truth was sensitive.

"The Chain." Excellent
"The Chairs" told the life story
of two old people. a man (Richard
Rogers) and his old wife (Brenda
(‘aswrdli lt told their story from
birth to death.

Rockefeller, Goldwater, Romney,
Nixon Compete for C.0.P. Standard

by Gary Lucsdi

Governor Nelson Rockefeller’s
rte-marriage last week to Mrs.
Margaretta "Happy" Murphy has
once again sparked open'debate on
the heated topic of who will be the
Republican standard bearer in
1964.

Heretofore. the Governor had
been considered the man most
likely to succeed in securing the
coveted prize. but. ever since the
“tax—fee" controversy and the
revelations of scandal in the State
Liquor Authority. Mr, Rockefel-
ler's position has been slowly but
steadily deteriorating.

Apprehension within the Repub—
lican rank-and—file is beginning to
display itself noticeably with the
ncws of his re-marrlage.

Divorce Harmful

Various reasons for the waning
of the Rockefeller tide have been
forthcoming from prominent mem—

Romney's personal appeal as a

The play begins with the old man
sitting on his wife’s lap —— sym-
bolizing childhood -— and traces the.
rest of his life until his death at
the end.

The wife's story is almost an
exact replica of his. They are now
waiting for their friends to come so
the old man can lecture on hisim—
portant new discovery: but the old
man must wait for the orator to
come. so he can praise the words
just right.

People don‘t come, but the bell
rings and the old man and woman
talk to shadows and make them sit
in the chairs. Soon the room is
crowded with Chat rs. but the orator
still does not come.

Finally he arrives: he's dressed
like a beatnik top. The old man and
woman joyously dic still waiting
to hear him speak. \\"hen he does,
he has the voice ofan unintelligible
idiot: he only makes sounds.

Play Complicated

The old man and woman’s lives
were absurd. They belived in the

orator. but like t‘iodot. the orator
was never finally realized.

The play is verbally action-
piicked. it was sad. happy. simple.
complicated. fascinating. aan bor-
ing. And when a play becomes
boring. it becomes embarrassing
to the audience.

Rut Richard Rogers and Brenda
Caswell were superb in their roles.
'l‘hcy engendered the play with
spontaneous feeling. vitally kccp-
ing their characterizations alive.

The Setting and lighting were
Simple but very effective; it was
unobtrusiVe and successful.

The plays themselves were good,
the technical end was excellent:
the acting and direction were su—
perb. They were professional and
everything jelled to make themin-
