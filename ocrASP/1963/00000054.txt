A funny thing happened to the varsity baseball squad
at Cortland last week — they came back alive. The
mere fact that Burlingame’s lads got massacred 10—2
on the diamond is incidental.

But hold! Of course we only make jest. Heck, our
ball players sojourned over to Cortland with light
hearts and a song on their lips. They also sojourned
with two light tanks, an armored bus, four state police
cars, a truckload of beer (to appease the natives),
four companies of boy scouts, and a contingent from
the 101st Airborne.

Strangely enough, Cortland was practically deserted
when the team pulled into town. Maybe the fact the bus
eased down the main drag at 4:48 a.m. had something
to do with this. No sense in announcing Albany’s pres—
ence. Who in Cortland would care that State was there
anyway?

The game soon got underway on the spacious Cortland
field which straight away to center measured all of
340 feet. The field’s small dimensions were in part
made up for by the twenty foot wire fence that sur—
rounded it. thny thing though about itbeing electrified
when State took the field.

The ball game just didn’t go right for the Feds. They
didn’t seem to have their minds completely on the
game. Whoever heard of a right fielder wearinga battle
helmet anyhow?

So, the game was played and lost. But at least
everything had gone fairly smoothly. And so as the
Feds walked back to their bus who do they see playing
lacrosse. Who else but State’s other favorite school —
Adelphi. Exit State left, running all the way.
