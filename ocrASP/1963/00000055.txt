HOW TO SEE EUROPE
FOR ONLY $300 A DAY: NO. 3

When all of you go to Europe during your summer 'llOllthll,
you will certainly want to visit Spain, where the tall corn grows,

The ﬁrst thing you will notice upon entering Spain is the
absence of sibilants. In Spain “s” is pronounced "th" and
thereby hangs a tale. Until the reign of Philip IV—or (Iuy
Fawkes, as he was sometimes called—Spaniards said “s” just
like everybody else. Philip IV, however, lisped, and Spaniards,
having an ingrained sense of propriety and not wishing to em—
barrass their monarch, decided that everybody should lisp. This
did indeed put l’hilip IV very much at his case, but in the end
it turned out to he a very had thing for Spain. It wrecked the
siissafras industry~Spain’s principal source of revenue -and
reduced the nation to a second-class power.

As a result, Spaniards were all t'oreed to turn to hull lighting
in order to keep body and soul together. 'l'oday, wherever you
go in Spain lll Madrid, in Barcelona, in Toledo, in (‘Ieveland

you will see bulls being fought. For many years the bulls
have sought to arbitrate this long-standing dispute, but the
Spaniards, a proud people who use nothing lilll ('astile soap,
have rejected all overtures.

ft is therefore necessary for me to explain bull lighting to
anyone who is going to Spain. It is also necessary for me to
say a few words about Marlboro ('igarettes because they pay
me for writing this column, and they are inclined to pout il'l
ignore their produet. lll truth, it is no chore for me to sing the
praises of Marlboro ('igarettes, for l ain one who fairly .~\\'tilll|<

__ Goldwater Actively creating Image
“""m‘ mm" 0t Conservatism tin Senate Floor

by Joseph W. Galu

What is the junior senator from
Arizona doing these days? Barry
Goldwater is officially running for
his third term in the United States
Senate.

Goldwater was first elected in
1952 due to the help of the Eisen-
hower landslide. In 1958 he was
re-elected. defeating a well—known
and popular ex-governor. This
was despite a general Democratic
landslide. (Goldwater is a Repub—
lican.)

Since his appearance in the Sen-
ate, Goldwater has become a lead—
er of the Republican right wing.
He calls himself and is regarded
as a conservative.

He has spoken out against civil
rights legislation as it has been
proposed to congress. To him.
the bills are not civil rights but
instead are civil liberties.

Imago Builder
Goldwater has created an image
of conservatism. He has lead and
now leads the conservative Repub—

licans in the Senate. These con—
servatives include John Tower,

Roman Hruska. Milward Simpson,
Bourke Hickenlooper. and many
others very few people know.

Goldwater has become outspoken
and has made many tours of
speeches. He has written, or at
least been credited with having
written, a book entitled the Con-
scicnco of a Conservative.

This handy paperback presents
many of his ideas although many
of his louder advocates say his
Senate speeches represent him
better than this first book of his.

No Dewey Here

Goldwater has what is referred
to in print as “political sex ap—
peal." This means that there is a
chance he could win many votcS
from women. it means that hedoes
not have a Dewey-like mustache
to antagonize voters.

Goldwater has had his. picture
and byline on a column in manv
conservativo newspapers through—
out the country. It is commonlv
considered that his ghost—writer,
Stephen Shadegg, writes this col—
umn and that \‘hadegg contributed
heavily to his first book.

Goldwater has been active in
debate on lllt‘ \‘cnittt‘ flour. 'lilllS
contrasts him with Arizona‘sother
Senator, ('arl ll ivden who has not
had the Senate floor even once for

each of his Seven terms in the
Senate.
What is Goldwater doing" He is

at least running for re—electlon. if
he is nominated at the Republican

that this hero of the Republican
regulars will decline.

TULIP llUEEN--——

 

Joanne Gross

State Sophmore Wins Tulip Crown
Gains Key - and Head - of Albany

On one of the coldest. grayest
days of the 1963 Tulip Festival,
Joanne Gross '65 was crowned
Tulip Queen. Ceremonies lasted
about an hour in cold, suspense-
filled Washington Park Saturday.

Joanne’s first reaction was a
feeling of unreality. She said. “I
felt sort of weak ..... ..The voice
seemed to come from far away.
I was sure that l hadn't really
heard it at all."

Many Gift:

As Queen, Joanne receives many
gifts. Among them is a $375
wardrobe from the downtown mer-
chants. She will get several com—
plete outfits from this money.

A hand-made goldmedallion was
presented to her. This features a
tulip surrounded by semi—precious
stones. Mayor Erastus (‘orning
presented her with a gold charm
bracelet with two charms — a
calendar with May 13, the date of
the coronation, on it. and a crown.

Mayor (‘orning also presented
her With the. key to the (‘ity of
Albany. Many telegrams and con—
gratulatory messages were sent to
her.

told her that she could take the
trip, part of her prize, at her
convenience. It Will probably take
place in the later part of June.

Rumor has it that she. will meet
President Kennedy, but as yet,
this remains unconfirmed rumor.

In the near future. Joanne must

open a root beer stand anda music
store in the area,

A submarine ride up the Hudson
River will be hers, too. The sub—
marine will not be able to sub-
merge in the shallow waters of
the Hudson, however.

Sho Considcrod Dropping Out

Ironically. she was seriously
considering dropping out of the
contest completely. It is due to
the influence of Pat Cerra that she
stayed in and went on to become
the winner.

Queen Joanne's court, the 10
other finalists, are “all great
girls, all very down—to-earth" ac—
cording to her. They have plans to
get together this summer.

Now, excited but tired, Joanne
is looking forward to herproposed
trip anxiously, but a more, corn-
mon—place worry intrudes - she's
wondering what all thisactivdy will
do to her marks.

casual acquaintance and wife. who
loves Wilmer Flange (Tony Hitch-
cock ‘20), a young fool.

The two men vie for the hand of
Selma, who has a difficult time
choosing between wealth and ro-
mance. When these three are off-
stage, they are replaced by a
myriad of unbelievably familiar
people: a policeman (Jack Tkatch
’64) who loves to direct; a fright—
ened watchman (Jim Lobdell '66):
a victim (Angela Sergio '64); com-
plete with high hat robber (Kay
Jurewicz ’64): a hard workingwait-

ress (Joanna Tarroli '66). and
many others.
There are over twenty-five

characters in the story. Minor
parts are played by Blanche Alter
’65, Amelia Weiss '65, Herbert
Herzog, William Nuesslein, Linda
Delfs, Jon Burden, Patricia Fa-
sano, Dennis Tuttle, sophomores.
and William Mayer '66.

The technical director is Ed-
ward Mendus and his assistant
director is Patricia Fasano '65.

Theatrical Settings

The sets in which these folk
live, work, and play are as exotic
as the characters themselves. A
modest twenty-foot illuminated
sign flashes from time to time: a
piano dances: Martinas struggles
With a three—hundred-pound loin
of yak; and Wilmer performs sur-
gery in his toy invention studio.

fields to bedrooms in the twinkling
of an eye.

Satiric Jilin

Red Eye of Love, is as impossible
to take seriously as it is to take
lightly, .\ roaring burlesque with
satiric overtones, the play leaves

Without comment. The Show is
