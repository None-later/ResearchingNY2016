Welles Directs Movie With llistinctive Style
looses Wild Imagination In Nightmare Plot

by Paul Jenun

Almost every film that Orson
Welles has directed since Clrlun
K0". and The Magnificent Anter-
Ions has exhibited. at least in part.
his flair for the unusual and the
bizarre.

But often this extreme sort of
thing was limited to certain scenes
and segments. such as the cor-
rupt policeman's death in the city
dump in Touch ol Evil. The rest of
each film. while still distinctively
Wellesian. remains closer to
“normal.”

With this regard. the story of
The Trial is a perfect one for
Welles to film. The plot is that of
a nightmare and has the sort of
logic one finds in dreams of any
sort.

This provides the director with
an opportunity to let loose his
wild imagination. for the gro-
tesquerie of his style seems much
more at home in a dream than
some ordinary. logic-bound story.
Because of the unity of this pres-
entation. The Trial is probably the
most typical of \h'elles' recent
style.

Settings
There are vast. rococo. unbe-
lievable yet real settings peopled
with actors of odd shapes. sizes
and appearances; shadows are used

to emphasize. and editing is made
to do the director's bidding: cam—
era placements vary fromabove to
below to around the action.

Rooms overflow with hundreds of
burning candles; a love scene takes
place amid piles of books. papers
and magazines near a large paint-
ing lying on its side: the advocate
speaks from his bed with bulky
blankets pulled up to his neck
and clouds of Cigar smoke oblit-
erating all view of his head.

Chase Scene:

The chase scenes are especially
notable for their sharp. staccato
cutting and often overwhelming
use of light and shadow. These
sequences. and those at the ar~
tist Titorelli's studio with seem-
ingly hundreds of little girls peek-
ing through the slitted wall make
a great impression on the viewer.
and will not for a long time be
forgotten.

Scenes like these burn with an
infernal brilliance seldom. ifever.
seen in any film —— old or new.
domestic or foreign.

Despite the visual power of the
picture. The Trial has one weak—
ness that keeps it from becoming
a great film. it is frustrating.

True. much of this feeling is
intentional. due to the illogical
and dreamlike quality of the ac-
tion. it is impossible to conceive
of the physical layout of the set-

tings. as places thought to be dis-
tant often appear around the cor-
ner.

This is “le gal" frustration.
since it is planned.

Pointleunen

But the film also frustrates due
to its pointlessness. One can draw
a parallel between the introductory
tale about, not being able to find
The Law and the film itself. and
there also seems to be some com—
ment on bureaucracy and totali—
tarianism — but that's as far as
it goes.

Also frustrating is the use of
Anthony Perkins in the leading
role of Joseph K. Not only is he
over-excited. nervous and “twit—
chy”. but he also does not seem
to fit into the director’s grotesque
gallery of performers. headed by
Welles himselfand Akim Tamiroff.

Perkins occasionally settles
down. and the rest of the cast
(including Jeanne Moreau. Elsa
Martinelli and Romy Schneider)
is good. it is. however. the
photography and direction that
dominates the film.

The Trial proves nothing. except
that Orson Welles is still the most
imaginative. fanciful and fitfully
brilliant movie-maker at work to—
day. For many people. this“sound
and fury signifying nothing" could
be enough.

Band and Choral

Performances

Show Great lliversity of Selection

by Ian Leer

One of the severest problems
that a conductor has to face is the
problem of selection. He has to
choose works that people will
come to hear. or the best per-
formance possible will not be worth
a thing.

Last week saw concerts by our
own Albany State groups which
proved once again that the surest
way to generate interest in music
is toprovide interestingprograms.

On Tuesday. May 7. the concert
band gave as varied a concert as
possible. considering the limita-
tions of the medium.

Variety of Selection:

()nly modern composers have.
considered the band worth writing
for at any length. but even so.
Dr. Salatino’s program contained
such varied works as the ubiquitous
marches (this time by Rilik and
Sousa). a “Concertino” by von
Weber. and the “Finale” of Shos—
takovich’s “Fifth Symphony."

Unfortunately. the level of per—
formance was as varied as the
program. it seems that the band
does best only when it is really
inspired. That may seem like a
silly thing to say. but it is true.

lioiilii'vo'”

HUN/MIL”. ‘. oil

 

On the Shostakovich number.
for example. the band performed
well an extremely difficult num—
ber. and the players looked like
they were having fun. But on
Copland's “Outdoor Overture.”
the performance was ragged. with
missed entrances and squeaks in
several spots.

Two Solos
There were two 3010 works per-
formed on the program. one the
Weber “Concertino for Clarinet"
and the other the “Trumpeter‘s
Lullaby" by Leroy Anderson.
Jerry Bunke was the clarinetist.
and showed why he is going to
Julliard in the fall. He has a
fine technique. but more, signifi—

cant. a nice. full tone.

There were two highpoints on
the program, For the audience.
there was Dr. Salatino’s own
“Symphony Moderne;” for this
reviewer there was Hanson's
“Chorale and Alleluia."

Dr. Salotino's Work
The first movement of Dr. Sal-
tino’s composition had some fine
ideas for a work of this type and
was quite enjoyable. The other
two movements. however. seemed
either repetitious ordisconnected.

The “Chorale.” on the other
band. was a piece of inspiring
beauty that built to just the right
intensity. It was the best thing
on the program, although once
again the performance was marred
by slips.

On Thursday. May 9. the choral
groups were featured and once
again there was great diversity in
the program — even more thanthc
band. although this is to be ex—
pected.

Notable Selections

There is so much more litera—
ture for choral groups that it be-
comes the task of the dircctor to
choose pieces of merit. which can
be very hiird to do, Mr. Peterson

varied program in throovoiirs lhtll
