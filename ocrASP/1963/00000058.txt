Spinning the
Sports Wheel

by Bill Colgan

 

We promised to keep our mouths shut two weeks ago
when State lost its most loyal baseball fan for the brunt
of the season, but now we are able to pay tribute to a

fine woman.

The familiar face of Mrs. Eggleston, State’s own Mrs.
Baseball, has not appeared on the College Playing Field
since Opening Day this year. Several months ago, when
Albany sidewalks were glazed with several inches of
ice, Mrs. Eggleston slipped and badly broke her arm.
In subsequent weeks. she did not regain the use of the
arm properly, and thus was forced to return to the hos-

pital for further treatment.

She has thus been unable to attend any of the games
since re—entering the hospital. Fortunately, we have
now received word that she plans to resume teaching
her classes next Monday. This could mean that she
will be able to attend the games over the weekend. At

any rate
again well. This is enough.

it will mean that State’s finest fan is once

One interesting sidelight to this tale is the appear-
ance of a substitute teacher for Mrs. Eggleston who
takes his work so seriously he even substitutes at the
ball games for her. We are speaking, of course, of the
one and only “Dean of Albany Baseball,” Dr. Solnick.

This fan among fans, this devotee of Abner Double—
day’s whimsy, this sport amongsport, has stood through
rain, wind, boiling sun, and suffocating heat to cheer
the banners of Albany State onto new and greater con—
quests. Ah, well done, good and faithful servant. You
surely ratio a place in Baseball Heaven.

Welcome to Coney Island
Before we end our ti ‘adc for the week, we tool we
have to make a little cutting remark aboutthc. smartest
thing to be seen around our campi for many moons,
We, of course, refer to the conversion of dorm field

into Concy island.

Ry carefully removing the most

colorful bit on the State sports scene, dorm field base—
ball, and replacing it with a litter—strewn field, we feel
State has taken another stride forward in becoming a
“big” university. Yeah 'l‘eam!
