TILL WE MEET AGAIN

With today’s installment I complete my ninth year of writing
columns in your college newspaper for the makers of Marlboro
Cigarettes. In view of the occasion, I hope I may be forgiven
if I get a little misty.

These. nine years have passed like nine minutes. In fact,
l would not believe. that so much time has gone by except that
I have my wife nearby as a handy reference. When I started
coluiniiing for .\larlboros, she was a slip of a girl‘snpple as a
reed and fair as the sunrise. Today she is gnarled, lumpy, and
given to biting the postman. Still, I count myself lucky. .\lost
of my friends who were married at the same time have wives
who chose cars all day. I myself have never hail this trouble
and I attribute my good fortune to the fact that I have never
struek my wife with my hand. I have always iiseil a folded

newspaper eveii throughout the prolonged newspaper strike
in New York. During this period I had the aii‘iiiail edition of
the .\lanehester t ilitil'tlltili flown in daily from lCiiglaiid. linust
confess, however, that it was not entirely satisfactory. 'l‘lie air-
mail edition of the (iiiardiaii is printed on paper so light and
flimsy that it makes little or no impression when one slaps one's
wife. .\line, in fact, thought it was some kind of game, and tore
several pairs of my trousers.

But I digress. l was saying what a pleasure it has been to
write this column for the last nine years for the makers of
.\lai'lhoro Cigarettes a fine group of men. as anyone who has
sampled their wares would suspeet 'l'hey are as mellow as the
aged toliaeeos they blend. 'l‘hey are as pure as the white i't'lllilose
filter they have devised. 'l‘liey ai'e loyal, true. l‘tiliilitlllliilllililf'.
and constant, and l have never for an instant wavered lIi my
belief that some day they will pay me for these last nine years.

lint working for the makers of .\lnl‘llioi'ii has not been the
greatest of my pleasures over the last nine years. The chief
satisfaction has been writingr for you the college population
of .\iiiei'iea. If is a rare and lucky i'olliiiiiiist who can find it“
audience so full of intelligence and verve. I would like \'i'i'_\‘
mueh to show my appreeiatioii by asking you all over to my
house for tea and oatmeal cookies, but there is no telling how
many of you my wife would bite.

For many of you this is the last year of college. 'lllIlS is espe—
eially true for seniors. To those l e\lend my heartfelt wishes
that you will fiiiil the world outside a happy \alley. 'l'o juniors
I extend my heartfelt wishes that you will become seniors. 'l'o
sophomoris I extend my heartfelt wishes. that you will lieeoiiie
juniors 'l'o freshmen l f‘\lt'liil my heartfelt \\l~lii's that you will

school l('\'lt‘l|tl Iii_\’ heartfelt wishes that you Will iiini'i‘y money.

Albany League of Arts.

Waiter Terry of the New York
Herald Tribune has said the fol-
lowing about Cunningham:

“His New York concerts en—
tranced continental tours com—
posed ofhighly skilled artists, have
provided unique evenings: an ex—
ploration of time and space in a
new fashion."

The Curtain will go up at 8:30

treat. Tickets are being sold in
R-289 until Monday. May 20 at

Alden and Waterbury
Now Receive WSUA

After months of discrimination
Waterbury and Alden residence
balls were connectedto the carrier
current system of the University
radio station, W’SUA,

The first shows were barely
audible and could be heard better
in some parts of the dorms than
in others. but these problems are
to be shortlived according to the
officials of the station.

The hookup to Alden and Water-
bury was delayed by a dispute
between the University engineers
and the electrician who was work-
ing for the station.

.\fter a brief period of negotia-
tion presided over by a member
of the station staff. a few changes
in the existing system were made
and permission was given for the
completion of a quadrangle—wide
radio system.
