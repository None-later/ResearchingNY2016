Regents Scholarship liistriliution Faulty

The S. U. News would like to point out
a serious fault in the operation of this
university’s business office.

The system the Business Office uses
in distributing Regents Scholarship
checks is extremely haphazard, and in-
deed, an open invitation to thievery. All
a student need do to obtain his scholar-
ship is walk into the Business Office,
ask for the check, and receive it with
no questions asked.

We underscore the phrase “no ques-
tions asked,” for that is exactly what
the Business Office does. A student is
never asked to submit proof of identity;
all he need do is give his name. and the
check is his.

Obviously, this situation is an open
invitation to thievery. We, of the S. U.
News, asked ourselves, what is to pre-
vent anyone from going into the Business
Office, giving another student’s name,
and walking off with a quick $175?

To prove our point, the S. U. News had
a student do exactly that last Monday
morning. With the full knowledge and
approval of his roommate, Steve Curti
’66, Don Keisel ’66 took Curti’s check
out of the Business Office. He did this
in less than a minute; no one attempted

to stop or question him.

To make this a true acid test, the
S. U. News deliberately put two strikes
against the enterprise: (1) Curti, being
president of the freshmen class, is one
of the best—known figures in the school;
and (2) Curti had not paid the balance
of his room and board. A note was at—
tached to the check requesting it be
turned over to the school on the spot.

Even with these built-in disadvan—
tages Keisel still had no trouble at all
in obtaining Curti’s check.

Now, from this incident, it is obvious
that the Business Office should take
steps to prevent anything likethis from
ever happening “for real.”

We realize that with the addition of
tuition, and the widespread use of scholar
incentive awards, that the Business Of—
fice will he put under greater strain
than ever before this year.

But we also feel that greater steps
should be taken to secure the Regents
Scholarship checks of so many students.
We do not advocate Gestapo like meas—
ures, but surely some reasonable iden-
tification steps could be taken. .\ system
modeled after that of the Co—op should
prove effective.

A Wall of Misunderstanding

.-\s the semester slips quickly into its
final weeks, we of the S. U. News in this
our final issue, would like to stand back
for a few brief lines and look at the past
months.

For us, as for the rest of the Univer—
sity it has been a year of change. .\
new name, an increase from 3 to 4
nights of work, and a new printing pro-
cess are only outward indications of
the transformation that is taking place.

We have tried to move away from the
“(lee—whiz, why didn’t we have class—
colored lollipops on Moving l'p Day”
type editorials and have attempted to
search out and comment on issues of
Significance, topics of some conse—
quence.

We have touched on lllc fraternity
question, tuition, the i‘ortland problem,
the new campus, thi- t‘ollcgc Catalog,

a step in the right direction, yet again
like the young child this step has been
rather clumsy. The wording of some of
our articles and editorials has been
blunt —— perhaps too much so.

in some. cases we haVe shown what
might be taken as disrespect, we have
not always followed the most tactful
route and consequently We hayc aroused
some resentment toward the News. in
some cases, we have antagonich people
instead of correcting the situation, es—
pecially in our criticism of the family.

There scenis to be a dci'initc wall

the faculty and adininistration. We have

Baker Replies to Sneddon’s Loner,
Are There Part-Time Frat Men?

Door Mr. snoddon and Penn Club:

i would like to clarify some
areas of obvious misunderstand-
ings between us. it was not
rumored, but known to members
in your organization (call a spade
a spade). that i wrote the article

in suppression.

l went to great pains to inform
Dr. Solnlck, one of your honor-
aries, on the Wednesday before
the article's appearance of my
intent and general message, Your
president, Gary Penfleld, as well
as several other men in different
fraternities knew its origin and
content before publication.

it was not my intention to have
EEP men know who wrote it either
before or immediately after its
appearance, but unfortunately this
did occur.

The purpose of writing unsigned
articles or editorials is to remove
the coloration of the author's per—
sonality and known views andailow
the message to be weighed on its
own merits. Dave .lenks can best
explain why the article did not ap—
pear in the Now: as originally
planned.

1 am waging no personal vendetta
against Potter Club, only against
the philosophy of an organization
(yours) that denies more than a
token responsibility fortheactions
of its undergraduate members at
unsponsored affairs andactivities

l recognize the fact that you
claim to .ltt‘ an organization of
Fellowship and not a fraternity,
although i fall to discern a dif—
ference other than that of seman-
tics.

nal appurtenances: lFt‘, rushing,
bidding, pledging, pins, etc") But

ltui I cannot feel anything but
contempt for [hosi- who iliiiik that

life has to be led through compro-
mise after compromise. Ulti-
mately you have nothing left to
compromise with.

Facing “reality! " does not mean
you have to junk your ideals. only
that you have tostrainyour moral
fibre and ingenuity in getting them
to work for you and society.

It is on this basis that l have
condemned your group for denying
association and responsibility for
their members’ actions at Cort-
land.

The same applies for the “now
you see it, now you don't" aspect
of the “Club-not-Club“ activities
of the “Club’s members—not-
members" (Will the AMIA trophies
for the “not Potter—Potter" team
end up in the Potter house?).

This dichotomy of viewing life
is biased in the Club’s favor.

You send out information to
alumni stating that a Potterman
is president of the Newman Club
or that a Potterman is president
of his class. The Club is ready to
take credit by association for these
achievements.

Why not? The club probably
helped them develop into the
praiseworthy people they are. But
what happens on the other side of
the coln’.’ The club denies guilt by
association and disclaims all re—
sponsibility.

“He was acting as a University
man, not a Potter man." How
long would he have remained a
Potterman if he had “performed”
at the Potter formal? What dis-
tinction in the Potter mind is made
between the university and club
events?

A fundamental purpose of most
small social units on a college
campus is to function as the “in
loco parentis." Denying this func-
tion belies one of the “raisons d’
etre" for fraternal social units.

My evaluation of Potter ("luh
has been made on the basis of the
activities of Pottermen, if there
l8 any other way of gauging what
Potter (‘luh is doing. lam unaware
of it.

Dr am i to interpret from your
remarks, Mr, Sncddon. that “l7ot~
ter (‘luh" has some magical, llt‘ll~
ulous—type cXisience and only as-
sumes reality on the rap of a
gavel and quorum call”

tlnc must be sadly misinformed
if he believes this is what Potter
(‘iub is in the eyes of others, The

i-iiiiiilar to my own

I‘Iicse were guys llldl i could dis~

cuss things with, guys i could just
talk with. and guys thathad basical-
ly the same goals in life, and. of
course. guys that would tell me
where l was wrong in my logic
when l was trying to solve a prob—
lem.

So i joined the fraternity which
was composed of these fellows
with such similar interests; and
never for one minute of one day
in three years have i been sorry.

But it is the present that is in
question. along with the future.
Recently, 1 underwent a type of
oral surgery as a result of which
i was confined to my room for
several days, and limited to a
complete liquid diet, when l was
able to ingest that. During this
time. i learned much more about
fraternities, for l reside in a
group house — a fraternity house.

My fellow brothers, who owned
cars, worked out a schedule to
take me to and from the surgeon‘s
office daily. and they brought as-
signments and books from school
for me.

Medicine was picked up for me
at the druggist's. and all of the
medication that was needed was
administered when l was unable to
do so myself. :\ diet was worked
out for me, and even cooked for
me at different hours if i was
unable to attend dinner at the
regular time.

.-'\li of these fellows, each con-
tributing his part, made my life
easier during a very crucial per—
iod.

So you 'may say, “What good
are fraternities?" i say that they
are good and do have their ad—
vantages. l say that i would not
have received such benefits if i
had not belonged to a fraternity.

i would not have received such
care if i had not lived at the fra-
ternity house: for the administra-
tion only considers large groups
and not the individual. However,
large groups are. made up of in—
dividuals, and when the individual
needs help, he must rely on his
friends.

i feel that l have true friends
in this fraternity, not just casual
acquaintances. One must consider
himself lucky if he has such
friends. The purpose of a college
education is to first teach one to
lch within lllH own society, before
it can really teach him anything of
the whole world.

This fraternity has taught me to
livc Willllil Hut'lclv, and within this
society, l have made many friends.
Many years from now, when I am
unable to recall fromwhichcoiirsc
l olitziincii ii ci-rinin liii ofinformm
tion used in my vocation, or who the
instructor of the course was, i will
remember lllt' fl‘ll‘lltlH andbrotlicrs

by Gene Tobey

President (‘erra says Senate is
doing a good job. if\\’ednesday’s
session is any evidence, Senate is
doing a magnificent joli.

Here at the S. U. News, we wish
we could take some credit, but the
credit falls solidly with a Senate
which has taken its responsibility
to heart.

The meeting Wednesday night
was conducted with but one parlia—
mentary argument, this when the
parliamentarian was called upon
fora ruling.

Ambassador Program

Due to the financial difficulties
of the Junior and Senior Classes,
the College Ambassador Program
