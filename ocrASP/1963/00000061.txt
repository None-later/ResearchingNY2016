Faulty Script Destroys ‘Red Eye’

by Harry Guy

Red Eye of Love is a rambling
series of scenes loosely connected
by an underlying satire on con-
temporary business and love.

Brieﬂy, the story concerned Sel-
ma Chargresse’s (Gloria Avner)
desire to marry the newly made
meat executive O. 0. Martinas
(Donald de Fano) but actually her
love is with a poor doll maker
Wilmer Flange (Anthony Hitch-
cock).

From this type of “play” comes
a nice evening. not especially bad
but certainly not good. it was like
a professional skit, doctored and
handled skilfully but none-the-less
still a skit. But as with a skit.
the show boasted some high-vol-
taged performers struggling
against the weak material.

Avner Tremendous

Gloria Avner as the Brooklyn
version of the girl—next-door was
brilliant. From her first dance in
the city streets until her meat
chopping at the finale. Miss Avner
gave a sometimes touching, but
always a bouncing. rhythmic per—
formance. Her character was the
show's mainstay. out-distancing
all the other leads. She was gay,
mad. and spontaneous in her role,
and excellent at all times.

Anthony Hitchcock as the hope-
ful inventor of a doll disease and
Donald deFano as the desirous
meat miser were both uproarious
and colorful at times. but charac—
ters suffered much from a shoddy
script.

Short Scenes Add Punch

The highlight of the show were
the short. comic scenesintegrated
into the play. P. Jack Tkatch and

Herbert Herzog were simply su-
perb as the Brooklyn cops.
Tkatch’s direction of traffic which
suddenly turns into an orchestra
and Herzog’s phoney death scene
were dynamically comic.

As the victim ofthe thief. Angela
Serio — in a non-speaking role —
was both refreshing and enter-
taining. In a part which was only
visual. Miss Sergio gave a spark-
ing twist to everything she did.

Johanna Torolli as the would-be
pure waitress captured one of the
funniest moments in the play. Her
gum-chewing, foot-bleating cari—
cature was a moment of truly
brilliant comedy.

James Lobdell, the most ver—
satile actor in the show. played a
total of four speaking roles. He
was the drunken nightwatchman.
the philologist applying for a Santa
Claus job. the Japanese soldier,
and the ice cream vendor.

The most dazzling aspect of the
production was the detailedlighting
and costuming. Both were co-ordi—
nated to make the show whimsical
and professional.

Scenery was suggestive in an al-
most surrealistic fashion — tops
of heads made the walls of 0.0.’s
apartment, and painted trees were
the outdoor scenery.

The sound effects interwoven
in the show. were expert.

The play’s direction was crisp
and sharp. the acting good. and
the technical end excellent. but
the entire show was struggling
against poor material. This is one
of the few plays ever presented
at State which seemed inconse-
quential and insubstantial. and i’m
sure this is one production which
will quickly fade into memory.

Luzcalo Questions Wieboldt’s Views
On US. - Latin American Policies

by Gary Lunoli

Four weeks ago (May 3) an
article by a Mr. Robert Wieboidt
appeared in the News.

This paradoxical piece of“puff-
ball" prose purported to outline
United States policy in regard to
Cuba in particular and Latin Amer-
ica in general: and although super-
ficially well-written. it was most
unfortunate to note Mr. Wieboidt’s
ﬂagrant disregard for factual ac-
curacy and his all too prevalent
tendency to hop-scotch here. there
and everywhere.

in a frantic but futile attempt
to engender controversy, Mr. Wie—
boidt has managed to notonly mis-
interpret my words. but also to
mlsconstrue my thoughts as rep—
resenting' “the common bewilder-
ment of many Americans unsatis—
field with the ambiguities of hem-
ispheric politics.”

Wiebolt Mllinterpreu

Mr. Wieboidt can mostcertainly
be assured that i am unsatisfied
with our present hemispheric pol—
icies; but they do not appear tome
to be either ambiguous or in wild-
ering — indeed. our overai pilit'y
is frigitenlngly unmir taxable:
“Nothing is worth atomic attack
on the United States."

This. Mr. Wiebolt snould come
to realize. is the“unreasoned fear
of the insecure" about which he
spoke: and it would appear then
that Mr. Wieboidthimseiffalls into
this category.

But it is absurd to think that
Krushchev would risk the self-
annlhilation that would most cer—
tainly follow should he choose to
launch World War iii over so in—
significant a link inthe greatC‘om-
munist scheme of things as Cuba.

Henry Taylor draws this superb
analogy: “You could pull out
Castro’s beard hair by hair and

throw him head first into Mount
Vesuvius before Krushchev would
run the risk of Atomic bombs
obliterating the USSR..."

Must Prevent Panic

if these people (and their coun—
terparts in the State department)
persist in their panicky assump-
tions. there will be no end to the
gains that Mr. Krushchev will be
able to wring out of the free world
simply by waving the nuclear “big
stick.”

if we continue with theseerratic
and erroneous notions. we willonly
be hastening our arrival atoblivion
which lies ominously at the end of
the one-way street marked “ap-
peasement.”

Mr. Wieboidt went on to state
that “when the administration bans
ineffectual anti—Castro raids on
Cuban shipping. the administration
is not guaranteeinga Red regime."

U. S. Guarantees Castro

Not only is the administration
guaranteeing Castro's existence,
but it has all but destroyed the
hopes, and aspirations of the many
thousands of Cuban refugees who
were anxiously awaiting the day
when they could once again return
to a democratized Cuba.

To Mr. Wieboidt they were
“abortive small—scale piracies";
to the (‘uhans they were. an active
expression, howevor inconsequen—
tial they have have seemed. of
their intense desirc to rid their
country of a blood—thirsty (‘om-
munisi parasite.

Raids Serve Purpose

Mr, Wieboidt states further that
these raids will not "erase the
reality of Soviet Presence in
Cuba." Wouldthecstcemcdgcntlc—
man then mind answering a ques-
tion: is our presentpolicy achiev—
ing this end" i don‘t think so.

We thus have come full circle
it seems and we again face the
perplexion: what is our Cuban
policy? Mr. Wieboidt sees our
policy as having two immediate
foci. interesting. Apparently Mr.
Wieboidt is using a better pair of
binoculars than i — my picture
comes through hazy and blurred
if at all.

I must therefore conclude thathe
is actually dreaming and that his
utterances are only a written ex—
pression of what he wishes were
the case — not what it is.

Conference lnelfectual

“Kennedy’s San Jose conference
initiated....." absolutely nothing.
Agreed, there was discussion of
the Cuban situation (with. it should
be noted, agitation from many Latin
American leaders for a strong.
united. American stand). but only
a footloose groundwork wasestab-
lished and its implementation has
been proceeding at less than the
proverbial snail's pace.

Mr. Wieboidt states that "free
world trade to Cuba has been cut
tenfold" —- by whose estimation,
the State department‘s? But. even
if this were the case, a ten—fold
Cut in trade is hardly a nick in the
woodwork.

Only when free world trade to
Cuba is cut to nothing will the cf—
fccts on that island's economy he—
gin to be really felt by (‘astro and
ultimately Krushchev. So long as
ships flying the British flag con—
tinue to arrch in Havana almost
daily (as indeed they are) it is
hard for one to say that any ef—
fective economic sanctions are
really being imposed.

i was glad that Mr. Wieboidt
fclt the. desire and took the op—
portunity to express his views.
Hui \"(‘l‘ll1ll hop-scotch and shallow
reasoning are no fit substitutions

LET’S TALK GREEK I

by John Shipherd and Joe Cambridge

We hope that by the time that this article appears,
the findings of the committee concerned with the status
of fraternities and sororities on the new campus will

have already been released.

As a result we have de—

cided to postpone an extended discussion of Dr. Shaf—
fer’s views, since we feel that the forthcomingclecision

deserves top—priority.
It is our opinion that the

existence of the committee

has had, for the most part, a beneficial influence on

fraternities and sororities on this campus.

Many

positive changes have taken place within these organ—

izations, but we do not mean

to imply that it was only the

pressure of this committee which brought about these

changes.

We believe this committee acted as a catalytic agent
in that it illustrated the necessity for iindinga ensible,
effective and realistic solution much more rapidly than

had ever been anticipated.

it is our opinion that a negative decision on the part
of the administration would be totally and completely
unrealistic, since many of the problems and difficulties

that have been uncovered

could never be adequately

solved in a single year. The committee has made it
easier for the (frock organizations to isolate their dif—
