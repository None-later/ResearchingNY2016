AMIA Softball Season Nears End

Discussors Clinch Second League

It was a big week in AMIA
Softball with many league deciding
games played. With the season
drawing to a close, all the top
teams were fighting to stay on top.
In some cases they succeeded in
their attempt. The lncognitos
dropped several games because of
forfeits. This has threatened the
big lead that the lncognitos had
built up in games past. SLS has
moved up to challenge the Incog-
nitos for the lead. APA I lost an
opportunity when they lost an ex-
citing game to SLS.

APA Drops One To SL5

The action was fast and furious
as SLS defeated the boys from
South Lake Ave. Bill Burnett went
the distance for APA and Bob
Calimeri received the winforSLS.
Good play was the password of the
day. Each team looked good from
the field. Calimeri kept his arm
in good shape and the following
day pitched an 11—1 victory over
the Goobers. His bid for a shut-
out was spoiled by an unearned
run. APA came up with 7-5 win
over Waterbury. In a come from

behind effort APA scored four runs
in the top of the seventh inning.
The team managed to hold the newly

lncognitos Dawn Goober!

The lncognitos pulled the magic
act and came up with the winning
run In the last inning. The game
was notted at seven all when the
winning run crossed the plate.
The league now stands with the
lncognitos and SLS tie for first.
APA and KB are tied for third.
Waterbury fourth, and the Infin-
ites in last.

Spinning the
Sports Wheel

by Bill Colgan

 

Sitting down to pen one’s last sports column can be
a nebulous experience at best, but feeling basically
nebulous we shall take the task to task.

First, we’d like to offer our congratulations to our
baseball and golf teams for the fine seasons they have
had this year. State’s golfers made a shambles of the
State Golf Tournament, running away with that annual
event. And Bob Burlingame’s nine registered theirfirst
winning season in three years duringtheir recently con—
cluded campaign.

Second, we’d like to make note ofthatparagon of cour—
age, John Sturtevant, who copped out to Cortland during
Moving Up Day. Have fun with Joe this summer, John.

Third, in looking back on all the sportsy things that
have been done to dorm field over the year, we would
like to advocate that it be turned into a small, compact
swamp, complete with alligators and other sundry cro—
tins. That way, it would be fareasier to get across than
it has been all year.

Fourth, we would like to recommend that referecsbc.
used at the basketball games next year, rather than
those clowns we have parading around out there.

Fifth, we would like to recommend a new sport be
started on Campi. We could call it “Dunk the Editor
in the Ice Water,” and everyone could take lessons
from the old pro himself, “Shivering” Dave Jenks.

Sixth, we would like to have a law passed forbidding
Albany urchins from attending the soccer games at
Bleeker.

Seventh, we would like to see the creation ofa new
sport that everyone can play while walking bciwccn

Draper and Detroit. It could be called “Shoot the
Urchin.”

Eighth, wc should likc to haVc the word nobulous
enshrined forever in the sports department of the
S. U. News.

And Ninth, we would like to congratulate. Ron llam—
ilton on taking over the Sports—Edii‘orship of this
magnanimous newspaper. In his capable HANDS, we
are sure the Sports Wheel shall continue to spin.
Have a great summer and stay sportsy, fans.

OPEN EVENINGS

SPECIAL RATES TO ALL STUDENTS

 

For the first time in history on
Albany State golf team beat an
R.P.l. golf team last Wednesday.
even though it looloed like the fore-
cast of another defeat as the first
foursome came off the 18th hole.

State's five and six men. Paul
Bachorz and Don Bouler.blgpoint-
getters all season, had been out-
scored 7 1/2 to 1 1/2 by their
opponents.

Fred Maurer and Bob Strauber
were the next arrivals. Thanks
to Maurer’s sparkling 73, the duo
grabbed six of the nine possible
points. Albany now trailed 10 1/2
to 7 1/2.

Out on the course the remaining
pair of Doug Morgan and John
Vrtlak were both down two holes
to their opponents as they ap—
proached the 16th tee. Two down
with three to go Is almost an im—
possible position.

Sophe Become Heroe-
However, heroes are made In
desperate circumstances. as the
two Sophomores proved as they
each rallied gamer to sweep the
last three holes and pull out a
14-13 squeaker.

Friday. the llnksmen travelled
to Utica to face a revenge-bent
Utica six whose only loss In an
8—1 season was to the Albanians
at Pinehaven.

Ray chks rounds first and heads for two.

can't hit.

To further their cause. they de-
vised a unique scoring system
whereby an extra point would be
awarded for the best ball medal
score between the no. 1 and no. 2
men, but the individual matches
would be worthy only one point
each. This system made the con-
test a rare 7-point match.

Strategy Pay:

Utica's strong 1 and 2 combo
promptly demonstrated the value
of this “strategy” and swept their
three points. Maurer and Strauber
were unable to cope with the.
treacherous greens on the Valley'
View on the disaster area.

Morgan. Vrtlak and Bowler all
won handily. and Captain Bill Nel-
son, playing his final road match,
rallied on the last seven holes to
pull out a two and one victory for
the decisive point and salvage a
satisfying 4-3 Albany decision.

Siena Match Remains
The triumph pulled the State
record to 7 and l with only a
match with previously conquered
Siena remaining.

The Peds will be gunning for a
win and an 8—1 record that could
surpass the 1961 team’s 8-2 mark
and make this team the best group
in State history.

Mam” 73 Is Standout FINALE SPDILED BY RPI SDUAD

Sophs Become Heroes

The Albany Staters ran into a
tough RPI squad Monday afternoon
for the final game of the year. The
boys with the slide rules figured
the angles and took advantage of
every break, there were not very
many, to come out on the longside
of a 6—2 score.

The overcast skies made it seem
as if the game would neverbe com—
pleted before the H20 would de-
scend to the terra ferma. The
weatherman was accommodating
and the game proceeded.

Weeks Starts Strong

Iiuy Weeks started on the hill and
\yeni the distance for the good guys.
For the first three innings he and
Don Iiologneri locked in a real
pitching duel.

Bologneri lliifl a streak of wild-
ness in lhc third which led to an

The End Is Bitter

Three more runs crossed the
plate in the ninth to put the bad
guys up five. Albany not to be
denied their last great effort came
up with one in the final frame, but
the door was slammed and the
season came to an end.

The totals looked like this: Al-
bany 2 runs. 7 hits, 5 miscues;
RPI 6 runs, 10 hits. 1 error.

Weeks whiffed 8 while onlyissu-
ing one free pass. Bologneri

State Crushes Utica

Bob Ryan notched his first vic-
tory and Albany had a field day at
the plate as the expense of Utica
last Friday. The team hadagayold
time and many surprises were
pulled.

The big surprise was the base
stealing antics of leadfoot Gary
Smith and Dick “Swifty” Odorizzi.
Gary Penfield had a fine day as he
stroked a double off the left field
wall and singled. He added to his
days total with two stolen bases.
