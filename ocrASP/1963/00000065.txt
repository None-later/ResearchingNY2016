State University 1970 Will Present
Panorama of Beauty Plus Utility

by Colonel Walter M. Tisdale
Assistant to the President

“A thing of beauty is a joy for—
even..."

The completely new campus of
State University of New York at
Albany will not only be a “thing of
beauty” but also the result of p1an~
ning for the future, in that enough
acreage has been acquired for future
expansion oftheUniversityfacilities
to encompass the cver~increasing
enrollment of students from all over
the State.

The 301 acres already purchased
from the Albany Country Club, on
the western outskirts of Albany is
easily accessible from all parts of
the State, due to the proximity of
the New York State Thruway and
the Northway, where the exits of
these highways are right across
the road from the University cam-
pus.

Construction Began

The erection of the Scrviccbuild-
tags and the first Dormitory are now
in process and the start of tho .ica—
demic complex is cxpcctt-d this
summer,

Three stories will be above ground

be used to go from one building to
another, without fear of inclemcnt

Gremlins to be First

The Freshman class entering in
1903 will have the distinction, and
we feel, the joy, of being the first
class to he graduated from the new
University,

They have many hours of pleas—

demically, because of the new fa-
cilities in educationbecoming avail-
able to them, and also tor the many
new recreational plansbeing created
specifically for their leisure mo»

In comparison with some of thc

cal education.

Accommodations for both men
and women are incorporated in the
present plan and later on there will
be a separate gymnasium for women.
Many outdoor areas are being
planned for sports such as baseball,
football, and lacrosse, so that meets
may he held on our home grounds.

Library Expansion

The library is being planned to
house 1,000,000 volumes, with many
private studying carrels. A great
deal of room has been allotted for
further expansion.

Churches of all denominations
are within walking distance of the
campus and one of the best shopping
districts in the area is just across
the road from the University,

The University has been most
fortunate, through the generosity of
the State of New York, to seciirethe
services of liidward Durell Stone,
as architect for this complete uni—
versity complex,

Mr. Stone has designed such out-
standing examples of architecture
as the American Embassy at Delhi,
India, ink] the World’s Fair Pavilion
for the American exhibit at Brus-
sels, Belgium.

in order to make the beauty of
these buildings stand out frotn the
beginning, the campus will be land—
scaped for cotnpletion at the same
time as the buildings.

Beautiful courtyards, fountains,
reflecting pools, a lake with a nat—
ural setting around which picnics
can bc arr angcd, well-lighted
grounds and roads — all this will
contribute to the charm of a Uni—

versity which we are sure you will
be very

intellectual Developement Comes First
But Modern University Must Also
Tend to Building 'the Whole Man’

by David Hartley
Dean of Students

The tnodern American university
academic developement of its stu-
dents. It believes that intellectual
development is first and foremost,
but that beyond this, the ability to
get along with others, the develop-
ment of personal standards of be-
havior, and an interest in cultural
or social affairs should be a part
of the educated man.

The basic unit for the entire Uni-
versity experience is the residence
hall or living group, The residence
hall is morc titan a good bed and
board. it is the place in which most
students, by living with one or two
others in close proximity and 15
or 20 others in a corridor or floor,
learn some of the basic facts of
fundamental human relations,

Living With Others

llc learns of his own, and the
other fellows’, right to privacy, of
other religious and social beliefs
and interests, and of how small
groups can work and play together.
Within the hall he also has the
chance to participate '11] ball gov-
ernment and share in various social
and cultural events. The Residence
Hall Director atid his or her staff
of graduate students are available
when desired.

Looking at the broader Univer-
sity scene, there are numerous pos-
sibilities for the development of
interests through democratic par—
ticipation in informal and formal
groups. From “scrubbing” on a
team to singing in the lloliday Sing,
to typing copy for the State Uni-
versity News, to participating in

tion, to joining a week—end outing at
the University Camp, to attending
the Junior Prom, one can progress
to serving on Senate or as an editor
of the yearbook.

Student Guides His Own Lite

Here are opportunities for serv-
ice and leadership. The general at-
mosphere is one to be determined
by the student himself. It is as-
sumed that students will set their
own course and emphasis on what
is important to them.

These various programs are syn—
chronized and assisted by the Co-
ordinator of Student Activities.

Being human, there will be times
when many students will ask them-
selves questions such as “Do i
worry too much?” or “Am i less
confident than she is’."’ or “Am I
really interested in my major?"
it is to answer these and other
questions that students may con-
sult the Counseling Service. The
professional counselors of this
office can help the student in per-
sonal, academic, and occupational
self-understanding and in making
referrals to other offices when ap-
propriate.

Financial Office

To help students find their way
to the many loan funds, scholar—
ships, awards, and part-time jobs,
an Office of Financial Aids is avail—
able.

The Dean of Students and the
Dean of Women are responsible for
all of these activities and are es—
pecially charged with the develop-
ment of standards of student be-
havior and student morale. Both
students and parents should feel
free to consult either ofthcse people.
