Admissions Office
Screens liver 41m

Applicants per Year

by Dr. Walter Schultz

Director of Admis sions

The elements of the population ex-
plosion are very obvious to these 01'
us in College Admissions. The in-
creased demand for a college edu-
cation as well as the prestige im-
plied by such an experience has
increased the numbers seeking ad-
mission at a rate even greater
than the population growth.

The State University of New York
at Albany is prepared to meet this
challenge through rapid expansion
of its physical plant and educational
offerings. It is the function of the
Admissions Office to interpret these
programs to High School Guidance
Counselors, and prospective stu-
dents and their parents.

Stott Travels 30,00 Miles

A four-man staff last year trav°-
eled 30,000 miles and spoke to 15,000
persons in this effort.

In the last five years the number
of applications for Albany has in-
creased from 2200 to 3000, 3200,
3300, and this year 4000. The Ad-
missions Office must accumulate
records for each of these, then,
through careful screening, estimate
who can best profit from the op-
portunities available here.

Within the framework of contin—
uing follow-ups for the past 25 years,
only those with reasonable prob-
abilities of success are encouraged.
This is no small task since Albany's
peculiar excellence demands more
than the gentlemen’s “C”.

Personal Interview Given

After caretlily analysis of High
School records, test data and,Coun-
selor recommendations, the 4000
applications for 1963 were reduced
to 1700. These were invited for
personal interviews. Of these 1500
were offered admission in order to
have approximately 1100 new stu—
dents registered here this fall.

The peculiar excellence oi'Albany
has its roots in these 1100 selected
candidates, They will come pre-
dominantly from the top quarter of
their High School class. Approxi-
mately three-quarters of them will
have High School averages of better
than 85%.

Regents Scholarships will be held
by 507;, of these candidates and 40%
will hold other scholarship assist-
ance. With this start, and a con-
tinuing selection process over the
next four years, we will graduate
young men and women who will be
recognized from coast to coast as
hearing our unique approval.

Excellence to Continue

The growth pattern does not show
signs of slacking. With construction
for 10,000 students, and enrollments
by 1070 to rent-117500, it would ap-
pcar that there should be a reduc-
tion in quality of czmdidates, This
will not be the case.

The Admissions Office, as an
agent. for the faculty, is dedicated
to the ideal that each shall be
given the opportunity to become
all lie is capable of being. Uur
peculiar excellence shall continue
as long as this opportunity is not
denied to those who can profit from
our offerings.

NEW CURRICULUM PAOES

by Dr. J. M. Deeringer
Dean of Academic Affairs

Constant curriculum planning is
essential as a university endeavors
to keep pace with the changing needs
of society. That office charged with
the university-wide coordination of
the undergraduate academic pro-
gram at our University is the Office
of the Academic Dean.

In cooperation with the deans and
faculties of the various schools, the
Academic Dean is directly con-
cerned with the promotion of a pro-
gram of studies that will most near-
ly fulfill the new obligations of this
University — to provide a breadth
of offerings designedto prepare men
and women to enter not only the
teaching programs, but also :1 var-
iety of other fields either directh
upon graduation with the bachelor’s
degree or upon completion of grad-
uate or professional study.

New Majors, Courses
The 1963-1964 general catalog
very clearly presents the breadth
of interest. that can be explored
through the undergraduate program.
New majors appear in the catalog
for the first time; for example,

Russian, Atmospheric Sciences,
Geology, Philosophy, Inter-Amer-
ican Language and area Studies.
Reference is made to pre—profes-
sional programs designed to pre-
pare students to enter medicine,
dentistry, law, and other profes-
sions.

New course offerings in the areas
of Anthropology, Italian, and Por-
tuguese, appear for the first time.
New titltes such as “History of
India", “Europe and the Far East”,
“Economic Systems and Structures
of Latin America,” point up the
internationalizing of the program.

Wide Range of Electives

The degree pattern as developed
by the Undergraduate Curriculum
Committee permits our students to
explore a variety of offerings and
to prepare to work in many fields.
Although each student is required
to complete specific courses in a
major field, students at Albany may
select the remaining hours from an
ever-increasing number oft-ourses,

Wise selection on the student’s
part can mean a breadth of back-
ground that will prepare him to he—
become a very effective member of
American society and at the same

 

UNIVERSITY’S GROWTH

time, make him a very valuable
asset on the labor market. Thus,
sound academic planning is essen-
tial in order to get the most out of
a program.

Faculty advisors in the major
departments stand ready to assist
students in the planning. Then too,
the Academic Advisors in the Office
of the Academic Dean and Univer-
sity College are ready to discuss
the overall program or to explore
with the student, academic prob-
lems that seem to be developing.

University Prestige

The prestige of the university is
determined not only by the program'
it offers, but also by the academic
standards it maintains. Our overall
academic policy results from action
taken by the faculty and by the
Committee on Academic Standing.

To the Academic Dean, in cooper-
ation with the Dean, University Col—
lege, is delegated the responsibility
for the interpretation ofthese stand—
ards. In awarding a degree, the
University attests tothe competency
of its candidates. Students of whom
the Unigersity is justly proud are
given additional recognition by the
degree hing awarded "with hon-

ors.”

The Dean’s List, published each
semester, is further recognition of
students as scholars.

If the time comes when an aca-
demic record falls below the stand-
ard acceptable for the degree, the
student is given notice that his con-
tinuation may be in jeopardy.

Rich Tradition, Bright Future

Generally, such students are
placed on academic probation as
a warning of action that must be
taken unless there is marked im-
provement during the next semes-
ter. However, if a record disinte-
grates during any semester, the
University must reserve the right
to separate such a student without
the privilege of probation.

Although we are entering our
second year as n University,~n
tradition of over one hundred years,
a widely recognized program of
studies, a highly qualified faculty,
and a number of illustrious alumni
have all prepared the way for this
University readily to accept its
ever—expanding responsibilities. [1
will r-ontinuc to promote strong
programs and to maintain stand-
;ii'tls that will heighten its prestige.

 

Frosh Weekend is an event long remembered in the life of any State student. Faces, places, and
events come in blurring succession as the new irosh begins his college career.

A series of Greek Workshops has taken
place in recent months in response to the
sweeping revival of rules governing fra-
ternities and sororities on this campus.

The most recent of these meetings took
place on September 16, 17, 18. Three
representatives from each sorority and
fraternity were present.

Dr. David Hartley, Dean of Students,
and William McKinnon, Director of SUO,
also took part in the discussions.

Plans call for the Workshops to be re—
sumed in October. A meeting with alumni
representatives of the Greeks is also sched—
uled to coincide with Homecoming.

shops have attempted to deal with the prob-

famous letter of last May 22, and in subse-
quent statements of policy from the admin-
istration.

Following on the heals of President Col-
lins’ letter, the administration made two
specific statements of policy in regard to
rushing and finance. make the above

(1) “Rushing, pledging, and initiation for
freshmen shall take place within a two
week period in the spring of the year. In
order to be eligible for rush, the student
shall be registered as a full-time student,
shall have completed a minimum of twelve
credit hours, and shall have a cumulative
grade average of 2.0.”

(2) The Faculty-Student Association shall
serve as a Depository for the funds of all
student organizations. This has been further
interpreted to include both the social and
house funds of fraternities and sororities.”

Work Proceeding
The task of the Workshops is to simply

taken place to reach this end.

has agreed to the creation ofa waitingperiod
