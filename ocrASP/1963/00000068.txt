PROLOGUE (Enter Messengers from abroad): Wetakepridein the growth
of our university, both in size and in cosmopolitan atmosphere. We hope
that Sue will make her experiences available to as great a portion of the
community as possible and not limit herselftothe traditional open Senate
meeting as have previous ambassadors. We also feel that Dave, Filed, and
those students who traveled on private initiative share a similar re.-
sponsihility.

ACT I: AS YOU LIKE IT: A possible theme for Fresh Weekend? Pritliee,
we do not mean toimply that the project of our illustrious student govern-
inetit was a failure, (it certainly was the most eclectic weekend yet) but
some frosh. especially the men, felt over—regimented. In the. future, a
choice of activities should be offered. Case‘in point: iiitist the guitar
player he forced into a soft—ball game? Perhaps the guilt lies in the
orientation of the counselors. But who will counsel the counselors? This
year, frosh outsmart their mentors on The Scientist vs. the Humanist.
Next year a revolution? Where have all the intellectuals gone'.’ Gotie
to rivalry everyone. When will they ever learn’.’ When will they ever
learn? (Exit chorus in mud and beanies).

ACT II LOVE’S LABOUR IS LOST: It’s now common knowledge that the
Greek workshop failed. Why'.‘ Can the Greeks really hope to rush and
initiate within two weeks? The administration will not compromise and
dirty rushing rules remain onthe books. Something’s gotta give. We hope
the i‘ecoiiveiition on October 1 will provemore fruitful and that some of the
parties involved will become more reasonable, (exeunt moaning citizens).

' Martin Mayer Criticizes American Education 

 

Secs Most Educational leaders like ‘Ncandcrthals’

An article in the September 141
Satumag SEMI; 20_5t by Martin
Mayer criticized the methods of
mass education in America.

He complained that new methods
are used by very few teachers and
that they reach very few students.

Most educational leaders, accord-

ing to Mayer are what Columbia
Teachers College call the “Nean-
derthals.”

l-le criticized the lack of attention
given to the training of iiitellects
and the over-stressing of problems
involving religion, football teams,
(latices. driver education salaries

Fraternity W0rksh0ps....

This is to allow both the group
and the individual the opportunity
to change their minds if they so
desire.

It is emphasized that only normal
fraternal activity will take place
during this time. It will essentially
be a “watch aitd see" time for both
pledge flil(l group.

Seem Fruitful

Iii the opinion of almost everyone
involved. the Workshops show pront-
ise of making great contributions in
helping the Greeks to fit into their
new role on campus.

According to Dr. llartley, the
Workshops are needed as a means
of communication between the ad—
ministration and thc fraternities
and sororities.

Once the administrations aims
and intents are made clear to every
Greek. he feels the problems of ad-

All students should take notice
of the important changes in the new
General Catalog. These have been
developed by committees of the fac-
ulty and have been approved by the
Academic Council.

Although these are alsoinentioned
iii the new publication called Univer-
sity Guidelines, it is important to
refer to some of these at the begin-

ning of the new academic year to
make sure that all students are
aware of them.

Changes in Maiors
There are changes in major and
secondary field grades. Foriiierlv
all courses taken in the major or
second field (or minor) had to be
completed with a grade of C or
better.

Financial Crisis... (More)

student accounts. The delay was
involved iii the audit itself not in
forwarding its results.

The atidit revealed that Surplus
contained only $12,288.00. This
changed the attitude of Cerra, since
it is believed by the vast majority
of Senate that the Surplus is for use
iii emergencies caused by the new
campus.

Cei‘ra wrote to Dr. Collins via
Dr. llartlcy stating his feeling that
fiscal requirements necessitated a
lumber increase in student tax iii
orth to save Surplus.

When ('ei'ra returned. he was
told by Dr. llartlcy that he would
have to withdraw his request. He
asked if his request would be granted
II he did not withdraw it. The
answer was “No.”

Senate reacted by frecxing all
funds iititil adjustments could be
made. Many senatorsindicatedtheir
feeling that the adiiiiiiistintion was

trampling on student government
and making a mockery of repre-
sentative student bodies.

A proposal that“thebudgetdeficit
for 1963-1064 be covered by Senate
Surplus l’imd” was defeated 0-6 by
Senators Townsend. Ferrari, Galu,
Genero, Guddat and llyland. Senator
Cttsato was absent.

The second proposal to cover the
deficit throuin fund raising sources
and surplus was also defeated 0-6.

The third plan, to redttce indi-
vidual budgets by tip to 409'} was
adopted unanimously. Thee were
few ticgatim comments about this
approved plan by any of the non-
committeemembers.

The plan adopted by l‘ inaiicc Coni-
niittcc was adopted by Senate on
\\'cdiiesday. A Financial Board will
be set up to propose the budget re-
ductions which will total atuinimum
of 10"; of the total budget of
$8300.56.

Effective this September, only
required specific courses atid re-
quired hours of elective must be
completed with a grade of C. Other
work taken in the major or second
field areas may also be credited
toward the degree, ifcompleted with
a grade of D or better.

Education grades are also changed
in the new catalog. Instead of the
previous grade of C or better, a
grade of C is required for ED 114
(Methods) and a C average for all
courses iii Education, which is ef-
fective this semester. Other regu-
lations concerning student teaching
assignments remain the same.

New Privilege

The Dean’s List student will re-
ceive a new privilege. The Academ—
ic Council voted to permit a Dean’s
List student who has a cumulative
average of 3.0 to carry as many
hours as advised by the chairman of
his major department. All Dean’s
List students may still carry 18
hours.

Each faculty member now deter-
mines the attendance policy for his
classes. There is no University-
wide attendance policy for under—
graduate students. who inust now
take the initiative.

After an instructor has warned a
student about his poor attendance
he may ask that a student he re-
moved from his class.
