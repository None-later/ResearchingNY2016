STATE UNIVERSITY NEWS. FRIDAY. SEPTEMBER 27. 1963

 

 

Coach Garcia, Past “Big Ten” Wrestling Star
Pilots Varsity Soccer Anti Wrestling At State

Jose (Joe) Garcia has the honor
of being the first coach to be featured
in what we hope will be a regular
series. We in the News Sports
Dept. feel that a better understanding
of the men behind the scenes is
needed. Too often these men are
blamed for failures and are forgotten
in victory. We hope this series of
articles will be well received by
the readers and add to the pride in
our teams and school.

Coach Garcia

The son of a professional soccer
player, “Joe” had an early start in
athletics. As a boy in the St. Louis
area he became accustomed to the
ever present soccer ball. It was
used by the boys for a makeshift
football and basketball as well as
the intended purpose. He soon
found that his talent for wrestling
exceeded that of his friends and
usually his opponents.

Big Ten Fame
“Joe”, after graduatingfromhigli
school, went to the University of
Illinois for his undergraduate work.

He began a career iii wrestling that
was to make him one of the finest
wrestlers in the country. Twice
honored as the Most Valuable Team-
Wrestler he earned second and
third places in Big Ten competition.
He graduated with a 8.3. degree.

Coach Garcia continued his edu-

 

Joe Garcia

cation at Ohio State and finished his
graduate work at Albany. At Albany
he began a successful career as
coach of son-oer and wrestling. Under
the guidance of Coach Garcia Albany

State has produced eight soccer
“All—Americans” and one wrestling
“All-American”. During the years
his teams have boasted a better
than .500 records.

Comments from the Coach

When asked if he preferred one
sport he replied, “No, I just like
to coach any athlete that bristles."
Asked about the growing University
he said, “We have the best equip-
ment and just as much potential
as any university.” What are this
years prospects? ‘A successful
season. the boys have the desire
and the determination needed to
overcome the lack of depth.” Coach
Garcia, we might add, keeps him-
self in the best of physical condition
and exercises along with his boys.

Student Support

His last comment was an appeal
to the students. “All I want frotn
the students is their whole—hearted
support. A stand fiiil of cheering.
shouting students to give the boys
encouragement to play their hearts
otit. With student support we can
have a team and a scliooi that we
cart be very proud ."

HAMMING
IT  by Ron Hamilton

 

A new year and a new sports editor sits in the
seat of the perilous. The desk is carefully tucked
away in the corner of the News office. The location
was carefully picked because previous sports editors
have been lmown to go berserk. The reason: rain—
outs, Wed. night soccer games, missing pictures,
deadlines and worst of all, unknown to the readers,

W.A.A. headlines.

What's New

We are going to attempt to make this year’s sports
section alive, interesting and provocative for sports
fans and students that are interested in their school.
Athletics, whether we like it or not, is the most im-
portant name building devices. Our varsity and fresh-
man teams are often used to make a judgment of our
school by other schools and organizations. Therefore,
by giving our wholehearted support to our team,
we are playing a part in making Albany State a re—

spected name in this state.

Aim of This Column
The object of this column will be to give the reader
the inside information in sports, to bring the readers
in closer contact with the coaches and athletes and
to sound off on controversial issues. The Common
Stater doesn’t always hear and see all, especially in

the world of sports.

You the Reader
The sports desk is always open to suggestions,

stories, scoops

and mo st

all HELP. You will be

helping to make sports news this year, whether you
are participating on the field or sitting in the stands.
We are looking for a great year with State’s teams
backed up by an enthusiastic group of fans. We will
be looking for the Faculty as well as the students at
the games. Perhaps it is not thinking too wishfully
when we say that, “See you at the game,” will become
the most common phrase arormd the Campi.

STATE SOCCERMEN DISPLAY HUSTLE
FOUR REGULARS RETURN TO SQUAD

This year the Albatiy Peds have a
team that appearstohavegoodpros-
pet-ts iii their oncoming season.

Gary Siriitlt, the captain can be a
great help to the team if he runs a
little faster. His fullback kicks get
the necessary distance for the Pods
to score.

Bob Seamon has proved to be a
good fullback as well as a center.

ing the fullback position switching
off with Bob. Paul flartiey, last
year’s only triple lettertiiaii, is
playing the position of goalie.

lt‘red ltawe proved to be a great
forward last year and is carrying
oitt the expectations of iiitn by
Coach Garcia.

Ed Wolnor, otherwise known as
greyhound, scored a few goals frotit

his outside right position. Luis Os-
pina, being a terrific ballliandlcr,
will definitely be art asset to the

tion. Udo Guddat is in the same
class as Luis.

Joe Pi'ocopio playing left wing,
has very good accuracy from his
corner shots. John Schneider, ano—
ther wing player, is tetriporarily
