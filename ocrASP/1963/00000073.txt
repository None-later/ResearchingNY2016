Complete lack of Consideration Suggested

Religious and racial discrimination are
dirty words on a big University campus
like this, but we are having an extremely
difficult time distinguishing between re-
ligious discrimination and the recent lack
of action by the Food Service.

Most people realize that the Jewish
holiday of Yom Kippur was last week and
that this holiday is one of fasting.

The Food Service, despite being given
plenty of notice about the holiday, made
no arrangement for feeding the Jewish
students who live in the residence halls.

Jewish days are divided at sundown and
not at midnight. For this reason, it was

Apparent lack of hot

While there were nine notable changes
in academic regulations indicated in the
University Guidelines, there were no no-
ticeable changes in the fields of per-
sonal responsibilities and student events.

This lack of evident review is regret—
able. While we do not hope for any change
in the areas of honesty, drinkingor gamb-
ling.

In the field of dress, we feel there
Should be more emphasis on neatness and
less partisan snipping at sweat shirts.
We say partisan because we all know that
most sweat shirts happen to have unintel-
ligible Greek lettering.

Our major concern is with the question
of the University’s role in guarding the
night time hours of all women on and off
campus.

There are too few printed rules on the
hours regulations. Where the rules are
open for perusal, they tend to be highly
over-restrictive.

Too often a woman who is unable to
return to her residence hall is punished
for circumstances well beyond her con—

the hope of several Jews that they could
be given their dinner after dusk. Disap-
pointment was widespread.

We find it hard to believe that this does
not represent discrimination.

There are not more than two or three
Jewish holidays during the school year
which call for any form of special treat-
ment. At the same time, fish or meatless
meals are served every Friday and every
Ember day (day of partial abstinence).

We feel that since Jews are paying for
as many meals as everyone else, they
should be able to get as many meals as
anyone without sacrificing their religion.

e Revision llisturlis

trol. No woman can be held responsible
for checking the working order of a bus
she happens to ride in on her way from,
let’s say, Rensselaer.

Too often women are punished not for
their lateness but for lacking an attitude
of subservience.

We feel that ten o’clock and eleven
o’clock hours are overly restrictive es—
pecially to older students and students
who wish to study in the library.

We feel that the state of society which
once could actively support the theory of
hours has long since disappeared. We
know of no attempt to revise the present
rules.

The only recent attempt was an in—
glorious failure in which only one minor
part of the hours regulations was in—
volved.

The existence of hours for senior wo-
men has caused riots on some campuses.
We have shown how civilized we are,
maybe someday the hours setters will
show some interest in a progressive
change.

Intellectual Awareness Needed

Starting with David Boroff’s now famous artielc
Saturday Review nearly two years ago, and continuing
on and off ever since then, this school has been ('l"‘ -
cized for its lack of intellectual activity beyond up
classroom. indeed, some critics, Boroff among lllt'i'.
have even gone so far as to wonder how much intelli-
tual atmosphere exists in the classrooms themscl'.

\"hat goes on inside the classrooms is not so ii
the perog‘ative of the S. U. News as what goes on :i it
We feel that we can do a better lob
reporting those events of an intellectual nature lb v'
go on outside of the classroom. But to do so, we ll: :r
