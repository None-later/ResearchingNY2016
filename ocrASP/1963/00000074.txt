STUDENT RELATES EXPERIENCES
OF FREEDOM MARCH 0N CAPITAL

by John Marion

The summer of 1963 has truly
beeii one of the most historic ill otir
memory. I"0i the first tiitie ill
history, the Negro seetns to be
making .real progress inhis struggle
for equality.

When speakitig of the Negro revolt,
etents at Birttiingliam, Little Rock,
Atlanta and other places come to
tiifttd. One of the itiost significant of
these events was the march oti Wash-
ington for jobs and freedom which
took place on August ‘38 1063.

Many thousands of people felt
strongly enough abottt the citii rights
issue to Journey to Washington to
participate in this march. I atii one
of those people.

This article is ait account of the
iiiaich from the viewpoint of a
marcher, written from notes taken
along the trip. it will not be coiti—

intent.

My hope is that it may gi\c the
teatiet new insigltt into s'e\ei'al

National Student Congress End—dist?~

Freedom March on Washingtondc.

The National Student Congress
overwhelmingly endorsed a special
resolution endorsing the Marclt on
Washington for jobs and freedotn.

The resoltitiott, adopted by a vote
of 347 to 61 with 20 abstentions,
stated that: The United States Na-
tional Student Association strongly
supports this effort (the march)
to bring to public attention the
related probletns of discrimination
and economic deprivation.

it urges all “citizens to unite
iii a sincere effort to retnedy the
present sitttation as manifested by
widespread unemployment and pov—
erty, and the denial of equal rights
andopportunities totitinority

The measure listed eight issues
as the “specific concerns of the

West Fails to Understand dialectical Materialism
theory is Base of Communist Action & Philosophy

by I. Roger Lee

One of the ttiain causes of the
west’s failure to defenditsinterests
iii the cold war has been its ap—
parent failure to grasp the cott—

cept of dialetical materialism, the

false tlteory at the base of commun-

ist philosophy and action.
Dialectical

materialism is the
pliilOsophy that Karl
Marx arrived at by
mixing theidealistic
dialectics of Hegel
with the material—
ism oi It‘etierbach.
Basically the theory
of dialectical mate-
rialism holds that
all there is ill evidence IS matter
itt motion.

All motion is said to dead iii the
direction of progress and is deter-
mined by the conflict of two cott—
tt‘adtctory forces knownasthethests
and the antithests. This conflict is
resolved iii a synthesis which be-
cause of its inner—contradiction stit-
fei‘s a new conflict between its
thesis and antithesis.

Inevitable Progress

in the material world this pro-
cess goes on indefinitely. Also,
since this matter which is moving
dialectically toward progress, is
all that is. then this progress.

 

having no counter, is said to be
inevitable.

As this idea is applied to society
the thesis and antithesis become
social classes. The necessary con-
flict is the class war, and the
change is in the revolution. This is
again said to be inevitable.

Activists

The communists believe iii this
with all the religious fervor of a
Christian looking totlte second com-
itig of Christ. This is why the quo-
tations frotn the July 14, 1963 Is—
vestia which appearedinthis coiuum
last week read, “...(We) believe
iii the inevitable destruction of cap-
italisut...“

If that were all there was to it,
the free. world could leave them to
their false expectations. It will be
remembered, however that the sec-
ottd part of the quotation mentioned
above read, “. . . (We) are doing
everything for this to be ac-
complished as soon as possible."
It is in this last that the danger
exists.

Ideas in Action

While the communists ltold that
the material world is the only pri—
mary, they also hold that mind,
thought, and ideas which are pro-
duced by matter are reflections of
this material world. They say that
once these ideas arise they may

become an active force on material
conditions.

Since these ideas are said to be
derivative, they cannot have powers
not fit keeping with the real world,
from which they arise. That is they
cannot work against the dialectical
movement toward progress.

The communists do claim. how-
ever, that these ideas can direct
tiiatt’s action itt ltarmony with dia—
lectics so that he can accelerate
the conflicts that carry the world
toward its final synthesis.

Failure oi Compromise

The communists see themselves
as championing the inevitable. They
do not compromise their goal.Sitice
they cattnot control the inevitable,
they cottld not compromise it even
should they want to. To counter this
intransigence the west offers corn-
protnise. Atty compromise with in—
transigence is. by the definition
of the terms ttot compromise but
retreat.

The communists are using their
energies to propel the world iii the,
direction of the classless coni-
munist state. “as soonaspossible."
Western policy makers, apparently
unable to believe or cope with this
fact, let alone the ttiore subtle
points of dialectical materialism.
has offered almost no effective coun-
ter to their energies.
