managed to sneak through on the
succeeding play and tag Hickey for

times. Jack Btichalter was APA’s

Running and Passing

We tttttst credit Hickey with a
gOod job though. Although he com-
pleted only one pass. he managed
several graceful runs and ptintetl

Fitzgerald completed six passes.
Four went to Cibulsky. The others

HAMMING
IT  byRonHamilton

Now that Albany is becoming a university, several
questions arise as to the attempt to adopt a university
athletic program. We realize that many gains have
been made, but for the next few columns we are going
to attempt to focus on what still has to be done: This
week football has the spotlight.

State Football

Albany -has the distinction of being one of the few
non—football playing universities in the country. The
question of a State football team is an intriguing one.
Believe it or not, State had a football team back in the
1930’s. The team just disappeared without many
records to tell why.

The question now is, could we have a team before
the move to the new campus? The prospects look dim,
with executive red tape clouding the possibilities even
more. We feel, however, that the time has come for
State to get on the gridiron. We would like to present
our case to the readers and An Active Board.

1. Interest in soccer has been waning at State for the
last few years. This year’s roster is very short
of candidates.

2. Participation in AMIA football from a player and
spectator standpoint has been increasing.

3. Football is a familiar sport to many students,
whereas soccer is not.

4. Football is the nation’s number 9% collegiate
sport.

5. It is not too unreasonable to assume that the
students would be willing to pay a small admis—
sion fee to see the games. The money obtained
could be used to defray the higher expenses of
a football team.

State would have the only college football team
in Albany and this could be another source of
revenue.

Games could be played at Blceker Stadium, either
at night or during the day. There should be some
time when it is available.

8. Practice could easily be held on University Field.

9. Equipment for practice might be obtainch second
hand from other universities.

10. Competition that would not be out of our class is
available within reasonable distance.

11. Football is played by a majority ofhigh schools
in the state, this would mean more athletes would
have had past experiencc than those with soccer
experience.

We feel that a football program would interest a ma—
jority of the students of our university. We, hope that
Serious consideration will be given to starting a team
before 1965. The years of experience gained should
prova to be. a bonus when we have the expanded facil—
ities of the new campus.
