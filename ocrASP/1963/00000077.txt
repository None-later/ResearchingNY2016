PRIMER Requests

Student Contributions
For Next Edition

PRIMER, the literary anthology
of the State University at Albany,
has had a long and varied history.

During its existence, it has run
the gap from ultra-conservatism to
the way out avant-garde.

The general content of Primer
depends on two things: the policy of
the editor and staff, and the type
of contributions submitted by the
students.

The policy of the present editor
of Primer is neither conservative
or avant-garde. It is not neces—
sarily one of expansion or trans—
ition. The only keynote of the policy
is quality.

Each volume of Primer should
not attempt to imitate or compete
with previous volumes. Each volume
should stand on its own merits.
This means that the size and con-
tent of the ’64 Primer will depend
upon you — the students. It is your
anthology. and it will reflect your
ideas.

Unlike most other organizations
on campus Primer does not ask
you to become amember orto attend
its meetings; it only asks you to
express your ideas and feelings on
paper.

This expression may be in any
genre - poetry, short story essay,
stiort play, and etc. Your expres-
sion of ideas need not even be
entirely limited to the English lang-
uage. Afew short works in a foreign
language will be considered.

At present, all contributions may
be addressed to Primer aiid placed
iii student mail under “P” or sent
to J. A. Gomez 540 Madison Avenue.

WSUA OniAir
Sunday, Oct. 6

Radio Station WSUA once again
postponed its openingbroadcast day.
Originally scheduled for last Friday,
the official date is now set for
Sunday, October 6. The broadcast
of the taped Friday gala opening
is scheduled for Sunday afternoon.

The 640 kc. frequency remains
devoid of State’s Radio Voice until
Sunday because of many unforeseen
technical difficulties; the extra de-
lay will result iii a more effi-
ciently operating transmitter.

The Soptt and Fresh Rivalry Radio
Skits will be broadcast Sunday at
7:30 p.nt. Special radios located iii
the Student Union and Brubacher
lower lounge will be tuned into
WSUA’s frequency of 640 to pro-
vide a common listening ground
for the competition. A large and—
ience is expected.

WSUA will broadcast program-
ming as printed in the S. U. News
of Sept. ‘27. Programming will be
scheduled to follow as closely as
possible the preferences expressed
by students living on the quad iii
a poll taken last spring. Programs
iircliide a variety of recorded music
University News and sports, arid
special events such as lectures,
concerts, faculty discussions, and
sporting events.

The WSUA staff is endeavormg
to prepare a year of enjoyable and
quality service. New staff members
are now being trained; anyone iii—
terested iii joining the radio staff
should see Nick Argyros or Ron
(.‘ampisi iii Waterbury llall.

WSUA, owned and financed by
Student Associations, operates on
an assigned frequency of tl~l0 kc.
by carrier current to the residence
halls of tltLtyiiatit‘aitit,le.

BllTItlll-LIZ Merely Go Through Motions in ‘VlP’s’
Film Looks Originality, Seeks to Cash in on 'Bleo’

by Paul Jensen

It’s finally here — That Movie
starring Those Two. Not Cleo—
patra, but a film tirade after that
epic, which M—G-M has rushed iii-
to release. It’s The V. I. P.'s.

The credits reveal the many “very
important people"
who worked on the
filrii. There are
Richard Burton and
Elizabeth Taylor
the reigning god and
goddess. The fortn-
er has occasionally
shown acting ability
(Suddenly, Last Summer) and Bur-
ton lias been referred to as “po—
tentially" the greatest actor in the
world today.

 

Minors

Others iii the film are Margaret
Rutherford England’s leading com—
edy actress; Itotl Taylor. a likeable
young talent; Orson Welles, the
maestro himself, as a motion pic—
ture producer, Louis.Joiii'daii,Mag-
gie Smith and Elsa .\lai‘tinelii.

l‘amed English playwriteTerence
ltattigan wrote the script. The di-
rector is Anthony Asquith, who was
trained several decades ago to lead
the British film industry out of the
Wilderness. btit wlto has since been
eclipsed by more recent directors.

But everyone else has problems,
too. Taylor (Rod), the head of a
small firm has just written a rub-
ber check. l-le riiitst be fit NY('
that day or be arrested.

Welles tnust also get out of the
country that day or lose several
million dollars in taxes. Missltutli-
erford. an impoverished noble-
woinan, needs money to retain Iter
stately Iioiiie and so must leave
for a Job iii Florida.

Shollowness

In addition to being unoriginal
the script and dialogue have a sltal—
lowness that is avoided only oc-
casionally. Usually it is either di—
dactit'ally explaiiatoi'y,or says noth-
NW, at all.

White the film isbasically British,
the direction and photography have
a Hollywood-type surfaceslit-kitess.

Memorable, for example, is a
two—profile close-up of air angry
Joiirdatt confronting a rtioekly ac—
cepting 'l'aylor. This short bit is
well done einoiionaliv as well as
technically. but as a rule the di—
rection is as vacant as the writing.

Make-up Overdone

Miss Taylor has too much make-
llll—f'lllllftilll' for Iter beami to im—
press. and her acting is inciel'.
Sllpt'l‘llt'lul.

litirton is faiilv effective, biit

Jourdan is suave but shitiioxi
