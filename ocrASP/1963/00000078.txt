New Senate Determination

That the line has been drawn for the first time
was clear at a recent meeting of Student Senate’s

Finance Committee.
The Station Manager of \VSUA made

a feeble at—

tempt at defending the station’s action in having a

telephone

installed without a hint of authorization.

The proposed coast of the phone was 200 student
dollars. The radio station attempted to present Fi-

nance Committee with a fait accompli.

that this first action reveals a determination by Sen-

ate to enforce

Revisions in Hours Regulations Suggested

Last week we criticized the lack of
changes in the hours regulations for
women. We now feel it would be ap-
propriate to express what we consider
to be a somewhat more ideal situation.

While we feel that the most ideal
situation would be one in which every—
one can be trusted to respect the rules
about morals, we also know that such a
condition is fleeting at best.

We feel that eleven o’clock weeknight
hours for frosh and twelve o’clock for
Sophomores and Juniors would be ap-
propriate. We feel there is no need for
hours for senior women.

Weekends should see hours extended
to one o’clock for all women, except
Seniors.

There should be no hours for a woman
returning afte ‘ a vacation.

When there are extended hOul‘S fora

Editorial on Negro Blasted as ‘Inhuman’

To the Editor:

The assinine position taken by
the State University NeWS in its
ludicrous attempt at an editorial
concerning the racial problem now
confronting us prompted my letter
to you.

Your “editorial,” “The Amer-

ican Tragedy,” is a tragedy in
itself - a tragedy of rash, fal-
lacious generalizations. a tragedy
of an incredibly poor exercise of
thought, a tragedy of incompetent
journalism in the misrepresentation
of assumptions as fact. a tragedy
of disgusting inhumanity to the Ne-

Eduoation Seen as Key toilegio Problem

To the Editor:

The editorialentiiled“The Amer-
ican Tragedy" which appeared in
last week’s State University News
was attempting to sited new light
on a problem which has troubled
America since the Civil War.

The writer would have us note
tliai although he is not a racist,
and is not prejudiced against the
“fine and decent negro” who attend
the University (God forbid) the
vast majority of negroes living in
this country today are just not ac-
ceptable to him. or to other white
men.

He notes that “decent housmg”
in New York City was left iii shant—
bles by irresponsible vandals when
a group of former slum dwellers
moved in. The reason for this is
obvious to him and althouglilienever
lets the rest of us in on it he
goes on to imply that the black
man has been conditioned to react
in a certain way and that it will
take a long nine to breed this
reaction pattern out.

His empiricle observations were
accurate to sortie degree but, be—
cause the author did not search
far" enough into the question, his
treatment of the problem was shal-
low and the impression it left false.

This is not a simple problem;
there are many forces at work with-
in society which limits the freedom
of choice a negro may have.

for instance- Did the authorknow
that once a family income has gone
above a certain figtire- and a very
low figure at that-they are required
by law to leave the low income
housing projects (which I believe
the author was referring to when
he mentioned “decent city hous—
mg”)?

This keeps the pl‘Ojei'tS populated
by the very poorest and removes
any middle—class example. Did he
know that there is only a minimal
Social wort stall on hand in these
areas to help the people learn how
to use the housing factliiies and
how to solve the problems which
have compelled them to live thcie'.‘

Did he know that most of the low-
lllr'olilc projects are built in the
center of these ghcitos and that
people from other ncn'hlmi’htrotls
are not cnt'outui‘r-d to apply ioi

Reader Praises

Writer’s Courage
To the Editor:

I would like to take this oppor-
tunity to praise the courage of the
State University News which in
its editorial “The American Trag—

edy” evidenced a rare gift of in-
sight into a topic pregnant with
emotion.

“The American Tragedy" was
the product of a rational detach-
ment, missing in the common hue
and cry on this issue. This article
reflects most favorably on themuch
demeaned intellectual atmosphere
of this university for this rare gift
oi rational detachment is the first
mark of the intellectual.

‘American Tragedy
To the Editor:

In last week’s editorial titled
“The American Tragedy” the S,
U. News made sewrai points which
need answering. First, it is trite
that We must “get the slum out
of the Negro” but leaving him there
is no solution. The American Negro
not only needs better housing, but
also better schools better Jobs,
and a sense of humandigniiy. lluman
dignity is not bred in a slum.

We must have stricter housing
codes, higher standards for all
schools, stringent iall‘ employment
critics, and a realization that the word
“patience” has lost its meaning -
we simply cannot use it 111 speaking
to the Negro anv longer.

groes and Whites as well.

For example, you have blatantly
misrepresented the truth when you
implied that all “inhabitants of Ne—
gro ghettos have no respect for the
rights property and otherwise, of
others.

The inherent idiocy in this latter
quote is self-evident. Your demented
thought consistently followed itself
when you fanatically declared by
implication that new apartment
buildings have been wrecked by
Negro inhabitants.

Again you have forged ahead in
a gross assuriiption of mass gen-
eralization and condemnation. You
remained entrenched iii your train
of poor judgment and obvious error
when you stated that Whites do not
associate the intelligent, well—ed-
ucated Negro with integration.

I suggest you ask James Meredith
about this or travel to the South
and even about the North where
Negroes are bated for their pig-
ment regardless of education or
position.

There was at least one repre—
sentation of the truth in your edit—
orial; indeed, it is the fault of
the White community that this
problem is existent iii our sor-iety.

However, even here you flagrantly
ornii a basic point and see no so-
lution to the dilemma.

Instead you stupidly ask the Negro
to be patient a while longer and
then suggest the necessity oi‘making
one human being “palatable” to
another; you also request that the
Negroes be raised to a polru where
they are “capable” of living side
by side with the Whites.

Your choice of words is disgust-
ing to any human being.

The poim I mentioned above is
that of human love and kindness for
his fellow man, regardless of po-
sition. One will never aid the Negro
with the position taken by the State
University News,

Without a compelling love for
one’s fellow titan. the problem indeed
will never be solved. One certainly
hopes that (fhrisrian theology and
basic humanity is not just preach-
mg without practice. Perhaps we
should all reread the “Good Samar-
itan"

In closmg, I would also like to
point out that a newspaper that
cannot even spell the term Negroes
correctly should not cditoi'ialize
about it.

Respectfully your s,
John Sturtevant '64

University of Alabama Admiil'stration
Silences Student Editor of the Year

UNlVEltSITY, Ala, (CPS)---'I‘he
1962-63 “student editorofthe year”
has been silenced by the University
of Alabama.

Mel Meyer, whose editorials in
the Alabama Crimson and White
gained liirii national attention and
drew repeated threats on his life
has been told by university officials
that he may not “write upon or
comment upon" any racial matters.

Failure to comply with the uni-
versiiy’s demands, Meyer said, will
result in, “severe disciplinary ac-
tion” and possible expulsion.

The Alabama administration re-
quired Meyer and all other students
to sign statements agreeing not to
write or comment on any racial
matters for publication, Meyer said.
The administration would not per-
mit Meyer to keep a copy of the
statement he signed. When he ap-
pealed the policy, he was told there
could be no change.

Aimed at Meyer

Meyer said he felt the new policy
was aimed, at least in part, at him.
He said the policy will prevent him

Senatelurns Down
WSIJA Request

For Additional $200

Finance Committee of Student
Senate at a recent incetingdefeateda
request of WSAU. the student radio
station, for a transfer of $200. to
pay for a telephone.

The vote in the 9(lilllllltieO was
four against the proposal and three
in favor. Those against were Sen-
ators Townsend, Ferrari GaJu, and
Guddat. Those in favor were Sen-
ators Cusato. Genera, and llyland.

The proposal attempted to remove
$200 from the appropriation for
records and transfer it for a tele—
phone.

Nick Argyros ’05. the Station
Manager, appeared before the com—
mittee.

Facts Uncovered

The discussion which followed
produced several revelations. The
phone was installed with no author-
ization lrom Senate. There was
and is no provision in tile \VSUA
budget for a phone.

Also the station manager knew
that what he was doing was out-
strip the financial procedure.

Violation Cited

The members of Finance Commit-
tee who voted against the pro—
posal indicated that their votes were
determined not by a value judge—
mcnr about a phone but in the
violations of Senate filiallt'liil pro—

from acting as southern corres-
pondent for the Collegiate Press
Service.

According to a spokesman for the
university the new policy only ap-
plies to student correspondents on
the campus. Edward Brown, direc-
tor of the news bureau, said that
the school “prefers professionals"
to do the racial news writing and
said that a claim that the policy
would prohibit all comment by stu-
dents was “silly.”

News Stories Permitted

Asked if the campus newspaper,
the Crimson and Willie, would be
allowed to carry news stories and
comment on racial matter, Brown
said, “They certainly will. They
always have.” lie said that the
paper had always done“pretty much
what it wanted.”

Brown said the policy was set by
the president of the university who
acted as the representative of the
school’s board. The ruling was first
affected last June and is being con-
tinued “until the trouble is over.”

Last February, the United States
Student Press Association(USSPA)
named writer Meyer the “student
editor of the year" after he wrote
editorials calling for obedience to
federal law in Alabama. The ed—
itorials appeared. during and after
the crisis at the University of Mis—
sussippi.

Cross Burnings

Meyer’s life was threatened,
crosses were burned on the lawn of
his fraternity house, and the uni-.
versiiy administration hired two
fulltinie body guards for him.

“The thing that really bothers
me,” Meyer said, “is that this ban
isn’t just against writing about
all racial matters.” Such a ban is
an infringement on the right ofiree-
dom of expression, Meyer said, anti
invites censure of the university.

Meyer said he signed the state-
ment “under duress” and plans to
continue his appeals against it. At

the same time, he said, he will ask
the newly formed Committee on
Freedom and Responsibility of the
Student Press to look into the mat—
ter.

Dean Gottehrer, General Secre-
tary of the USSPA and Director of
the Collegiate Press Service said,
“This ban indicates that the Uni-
versity of Alabama administration
is not as respectful of the rights
of its students as we had earlier
been led to believe.

Not Allowed to Write

Meyer was going to provide the
nation’s student press with full r'ov-
er‘age oi the events in Birmingham
and elsewhere around the South.
New under the terms of the pledge,
a copy of which still has not been
gist-n to Meyer, he cannot do this."

The case goes beyond Meyer and
thc Press, Gtriteln'ei' continued, but
questions the rights of all of the
students at Alabama to speak treely
about the situation there.

The i'oinniiltces on freedom and
ltcsponsibilit‘. of the Student Press
is presently being ronsulicd and Will
probably investigate the situation,
