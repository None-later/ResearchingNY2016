Progress Real Goal of Communists
Cooperation Only Means to End

with even the most cursory knowl-
edge of dialectical materialism that
from the communist viewpoint,pro-
gress can only be the result of con-

The communists, who are the
necessary second partner to any
such cooperation, do not deviate,
however, from actions based on the
premise that mankind may only be
advanced as the result of struggle
between the classes represented by
east and west.

by J. Roger Lee

It should be obvious to anyone

flict between thesis and antithesis

and takes the form of the resulting
synthesis. Lenin expressed this by
saying, “Development is the strug-
gle of opposites.”

 

euphoric things as ‘areas ofcooper—
ation’, and 'joint projects for the
advancement of mankind.’

Dialectical Progress

The dialectical nature ofprogress
is best described by the title of
Lenin’s book, One Step Foreword,
Two Steps Back. It is the dialectical
nature of progress that while the
ultimate direction of the movement
remains the same, the immediate
directions are subject to reversal.

This precludes any form of coop-
eration as an effort of progress.
The communists
neither can nor do
compromise titei r
goal ofprogress.
The same applies to
its necessary cause,
conflict.

Yet western lead-
ers talk about sur-h

The only example of this devious
process that space will permit is
the good use that capitalistic proc-
ess are receiving iii the Soviet Union
today. The communist goal is the
destruction of capitalism and the
erection of a socialist state.

They have found, however, titat
human nature does not make men

as ready to produce for the good of
the collective as the socialist state
requires.

Necessary Process

Since, according to materialism,
human nature is only a product of
its environment, titey tttttst change
the environment, To do that, they
ntust dominate the world and do
away with the old environment. They
cannot, however, conquer the world
unless they have ntore goods and
services titart they have now. In
the present environment, the only
way to increase the production of
goods anrf services is to use the
system that works tttost effectively
with man’s present self nature-—
that is, capitalism.

Once they have amassed the nec-
essary goods aitd services anddom—
inate the World, they catt change the
environment attd thereby change hu—
man nature. When tftis is accom-
plisited, they can do away witit
capitalism and set up their socialist
state.

It will be observed that they itave
obtained their goal (the destruction
of capitalism) in first moving away
front it. In the language of' the
dialectic, they have tnoved dialer:-
ticaliy toward socialism by first
going iii the direction of capitalism.

False Interpretation

Again, tlte danger lies not so
fillit'll iii the possibility of this
strange process coming to fruition,
but rather, iii the fact that western
observers see every tttovetttent that
appears to be lit the direction away
frotn the expressr-d goal of world
cotttittunisnt ill-5 an intiication that
the communist leaders have given
up their dedication to Marxism and
are ready to join the cotnittonwealth
of fi‘oo nations.

Senate Passes Budget Reductions,
Discussion Centers on WSUA

by lrv Carpenter

The main part of the Senate’s
meeting was devoted to the process
of passing of Financial Board’s
proposals to reduce budgets.

An executive recess was called
to enable Senators to read the Fi-
nancial Board report.

This report was drawn up by
Senators Townsend, Gain, Johnston,
and Miles arid SA Vice President
Baumann, who was citairtnan, as
a “result of the Budget Reduction
Bill passed by the unanimous cott-
sent of Senate.”

Rationale
The reductions wore basod on
two questions. “How wottid a re-
dtictiott affect the orgaitizatiott’sop—
erations during this current fiscal

year, 1963-1964?” "iiow ittatty
students would this redur-tioit af-
f'er‘t’K”

The budget was ctit briitgittg the
total expenditures for this year to
$78,097.07.

Only Camp Board’s budget was
reduced the full maximuttt 4051.
The budget of the Studeitt Union
Organization was ctit ittaittiy by
removing monies front several
dances.

ELECTIONS

The election for Who’s
Who and the preliminary
for Campus Queen will be
held on Monday, Tuesday,
and Wednesday, October
14—16.

The WSUA budget cut brought

quite a bit of discussion to the
floor. Nick Argyros ’65, WSUA
Station Manager, objected to the

$600.00 cut iii the litte for Records.
He supported his argument by
statittg that the radio statiott was

just starting its record collection
and tteeded every dollar it could
get. Senator Arthur Johnston ’65

to a (‘lose
the cuts itt all the
made otit of neces-

brought the discussion
by saying that
budgets were
sity ottiy.

It was moved “that the budgetary
reductions atid line changes out—
lined” iii the Financial iioard re—
port “be adopted tttto law and that
the Sttideitt Association budget bo

unfrozen as of October 1-1, 1903
with the exception of the ('amp
Board budget and the equtpmont

line of tho Depat'ttttont of itect‘o-
ation budget."

This was passed
itegatiyo

\v1tlt onl\ Sliy'
totes and one abstention.

Other Business

Questionnaire C o itt iii 1 t t or) re—
ported ott Wednesday night that tfto
SUU will not be able to publish tho
Course Guide as was planned.

Bob Sargent ’tid, SUO Pi'estdont,
stated that he barf cottsoitted ill good
faith to undortake this task; but,
altot' consideration, they tfocidotf
that this was inadvisable.

Sottatc decided that tiny budgotai '.
organization, willing to take tfio
l‘esptiflSllilliH', would be given tho
opportunity to pttbiish the gtiidc.

Senato confirmed the appoint—
mettts of Loy Augustine ’tit; and
Diane Pati'tcoilt ’60 as Semito Sec—
rotartos.

by John Marion

und Us

Most of the students at this university live in Al—
bany nine months out of the year but Iwonder how
many of them really know much about their “home
away from home.” I wonder if they know the names
of the public officials that provide the public services,
such as they are in this city. Do they know why
Hedricks is such a “popular” drink or why the Dela-
ware Theater now has a policy of not showing any
film condemned by the Catholic Legion of Decency?

The students of this university seem almost ob-
livious to their surroundings except to wonder oc-
casionally why the streets are usually plowed after
an overnight stormsometime after noon or why the
cobblestones aren’t replaced so their motor scooter
will ride more smoothly. There is no excuse for
this ignorance but trying to place blame is no
solution; now that we have recognized a problem
we must look for a real solution. I hope this column
will fill a long—standing void. In the past the S.U.
News has had excellent coverage of campus news
but has seemingly forgotten that there is a city
around us.

Also, there are many occurrences in Albany which,
for one reason 0 ‘ another, never are reported by the
local newspapers. i hope to be able to cover such
things. I refer not just to scandals but special events
such as art shows, concerts, and the like which few
students here seem to know about. Many Albany stu-
dents do not read the local papers and just never
hear about such events; they do not realize what they
miss in their unintentional ignorance.

If you have never been to a lecture at the Albany
Institute of History and Art; if you have never walked
along; Sheridan Avenue and seen the apartment build—
ing‘s that lack front doors; if you don’t realize that in
some areas that keeping children out of reach of rats
is a very real, everyday problem; ifyou don’t know
about these things you don’t know Albany. In this
column i will attempt to report these things so that
this University’s students will at least have the op—
portunity to know about Albany. Hopefully they will
think about what they read and respond accordingly,
if only to the extent of supporting some of the often—
ignored local cultural events.
