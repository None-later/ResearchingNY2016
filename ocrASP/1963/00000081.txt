Potter Defeats Waterbury, 20-13
srs Squeaks Past Cave-Ins, 6-0

In AMIA action last week the
Waterbury vs. Potter game proved
to be the exciting contest that every-
one expected.

As predicted, Waterbury was
tough and gave Potter a run for
their money. When it was all over,
Potter Club was holding on to a
20-13 lead.

A fast start accounted for 13 of
Potter’s 20 points, early in the
first period. Both T.D.’s were

went almost 70 yards.

Dave Jetiks and Dentry Pltillips
put on quite an exhibition, as they
cornbirted for toUt-h—down passplays
of 50 arid 20 yards.

Club in the third period, when they
put on a sustained drive which car-
ried 70 yards to paydirt. The touch—
down went frortt Camaratato Weeks.

Trailing 20—13 with 1 1-1/2 min-
utes to play, Waterbury had tlte
hall on their own 45, but their final
chance to tie was ruitted asa sudden

shower slowed down the play. The
final score: Potter Club 20, Water-
bury 13.

SLS vs. Cave iN's

The other game of last week saw
SLS squeek out a 6-0 victory over
the Cave Ins. We were surprised
that the Cave-Ins showed so much
defense or maybe it was just a lack
of offense on the part of the SL8
squad. The only T—D was scored
bv Stan Rosen.

Waterubry Beats 5L5 14-6

This Tuesday, Waterbury contin-
ued to play good ball as they came
back from a 6—0 deficit to win going
away - 14—6. Thorpe looked good
fit the first ltalf as he pitched a 20
yarder to Anastis iii the end zone.

Soon after, Jeitks hit Phillips for
a 40 yard touchdown pass play, but
the play was nullified due to a
penalty. Jeriks connected several
more times with Phillips for long
gains but it was Jerry Dolangerwho
scored the first T—D.

The above score cattte on a pat-
ented streak sideline pass play. Jerry
reported into the gartre btit didn’t
enter the huddle. iie rerttairred along
the sidelines arid sniick urtnoticed
ittto the end zone to take a pass
frotrt Jenks. The score: (5-6 at
the ltalf.

The deciding marker cairte iii
the third period. A pass frortt Jetrks
to Catone put Waterbury on the ‘3
and on third down and goal, Jetrks
flipped to Crarrlrirri for the score.

A safety was Scored towards tlte
end of the game arid Waterbury

3—1.

This was the first official game
for the frosh soccer teain under
the leadership of Coach Neil Wil-
liams. Coach Williams considered
the gatrte an asset to the team,
although the Peds lost. The ex-
perience of playing a specific posi-

standing teattr Work proved to be
the salient poittts ol' the game.

Led by the newly-elected co-

irtgly, the forward men of State.

150 Lbs. of Dynamite

AMIA is going to let the little guys play. The 250
pound gorillas and animals no longer have a strangle
hold on touchfootball. A new league is being formed
that only allows 150 pounders or under to play. Now
the little guys can show their animal instincts without
fear of being crushed by some overgrown potato
gobbler. It could be as rough as the regular league.
The only noticeable difference is that the ball will

look bigger.

Leftovers

The word has reached this desk that last week’s
column has caused a considerable amount of contro-
versy. It is, in a rather strange way, pleasing. At
least we have people reading the column. It should
be pointed out, however, that a certain line was mis—
understood. We were supporting football as a sport
in addition to soccer, @1218 a substitute. We have not
changed our opinions as we presented them. Uncle
Remus has summed up our feelings when he said.
“Youk’n hide de fier, but what you gwine do wid de

smoke.”

Odds and Ends

Anyone interested in the arts of a trainer contact
Mr. Kruzan of the athletic dept. It should be most
interesting and useful to anyone that is interested in
sports... Note to the readers: Homecoming is almost
here, so if you haven’t ordered your raincoat, do so
immediately... Note to sports editors: Stay away
from the Mayflower... another note to sports editors:
Read the Common Sttiter with pen in hand... Roses to
our athletic teams for a fine job last weekend (keep

it tip).

had to treat Sttr Katy, of the Univer-
sity of Buffalo. The perforrrtattce of
the eirtire squad was the crowning
glory of the day. Soplr. Joltrt Clark
and Junior Dennis Ttrttie were the
big surprise iii a great day forState.

Outstanding Race

The race was consideredtlrerriost
outstanding race l'tlll iii the history
of the LeMoyne course. 'i‘wo men
