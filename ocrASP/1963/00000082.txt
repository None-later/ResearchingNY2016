WORDS: THEIR CAUSE AND CURE

Today let us take up the subject of etymology (or entomology,
as it is sometimes called) which is the study of word origins
(or insects, as they are sometimes called).

Where are word origins (insects) to be found? Well sir, some-
times words are proper names which have passed into the
language. Take, for instance, the words used in electricity:
ampere was named after its discoverer, the Frenchman Andre
Marie Ampere (1775-1836); similarly, ohm, was named after
the German (LS. Ohm (1781-1854), zeal! after the Scot James
Watt (1736—1819), and bulb after the American Fred C. Bulb
(1843-1912).

There is, incidentally, quite a poignant little story about
Mr. Bulb. Until Bulb’s invention, all illumination was pro-
vided by gas, which was named after its inventor Milton '1‘. (his

who, strange to tell, had been Bulb's roommate at Cal Tech!
In fact, strange to tell, the third man sharing the room with
Bulb and Gas was also one whose name buriis bright in the
annals of illuiiiiiiatioii—Walter (‘andlcl

The three roommates were inseparable companions in col-
lege. After graduation all three did research in the problems
of artificial light, which at this time did not exist. All America
used to go to bed with the chickens, and many fine citizens were,
alas, severely injured falling off the roost.

Well sir, the three comrades~-lliilb, (las, and (llllltlltfrri
promised to be friends forever when they left school, but
success, alas, spoiled all that. l"irst (‘aiidle invented the can-
dle, got rich, and forgot his old friends. Then (ins invented gas,

tively of 75 and 71, went to sea as respectively the world's
oldest and second oldest cabin boy. lltilb, rich and grand, also
went to sea, but he went in style—ras a first-class passenger on
luxury liners.

Well sir, strange to tell, all three were aboard the ill-fated
Lusitania when she was sunk in the North Atlantic. .-\iid

State University Theum:

‘Fantasticks’ Rated Tremendous Success as Satire;
Sliilllully Woven Commentary on Contemporary life

by Skip Schreiber

Now and then a play comes along
which picks up the essence of life
and scatters it in so many directions
that it’s hard to tell exactly what
the authors had in mind. The prob-
lem of growing up and facing reality
has been a favorite in the theatre.
Couple this with a boy-iiieets—girl
situation, a feud between two fathers,
and a dash of satire concerning just
about everything, and the result can
be a miserable flop or a tremend—
ous success. Without a doubt,“Tlie
Fantastic-ks” is a tremendous suc-
cess.

Skilliully Done

The plav is skillfully held together
by a narrator (Dan Walsh) who be-
gins by introducing the young, ide-
alistic boy (Toni McKee); the bois—
terous, silly and self-assertive girl
(Bonnie Bradr); their respective fa-
thers (Dick i5oliiier, Art Kuciiiski);
and explains that the fathers have
built a wall (Ken (fox) between the
houses as the result of a feud.

The bo. and girl have fallen in
love over the wall and meet nightly
in the moonlight. The fathers are
overjoyed because the feud is a
hoax, and they believe the best way
to keep the couple together is to
insist they stay apart. Their only
problem is to remove the wall and
openly unite the boy and girl.

Professional Abductor

After considering a f'ewpossibili-
fies, they decide that the girl shall
be abducted, the boy shall play the
hero and save her, and the handles
can be united. The Narrator appears
as a professional abductor, bearing
a strong resemblance to Paliadin,
and the three agree on a first—class
rape (“they’re only young oiicel),
concluding that “It Depends on What
You Pay.”

Out of a trunk climb a faded
Shakespearean actor (Al Ross) and
an Indian who can only play the part
of a man who dies (David Hamilton).
With their questionable help the
rape is staged, the boy emerges as
the hero, and the happy ending is in
siglit~aliiiost.

The girl is still boisterous and
self-assertive, the boy still ide—
alistic. In the sunlight of reality
everything seems less pleasing,aii(l
the boy decides to seek his fortune
in the word] “out there."

The girl withdraws into a World
of tiiii'eulit\. and she asks the Nar—
rator to show her the whole world.
lie gives her a mask which removes
the pain and harshness of life aiid
replaces them with a pleasant glow.

She wants to go awzn with him,
and he forces her to give up her
rhinestone necklace as a pledge
that she will actually go. The boy,
however, returns, having grown up
considerably, and the girl realizes
that the world is not all happiness
and does not extst just for her

The fathers have long since settled
their differences over an unfinished
poker game, and the play ends hap-
pili.

Outstanding Solire

In less capable hands, the story
Could have been unbearabli dully,
btii if is not iiiai'ied bi. sickly
triteiiess, nor does ll straing to
make its point.

lts satire pokes at Just about
every modern convention: boy—
iiieefs—gii'l, the experienced lather
and the idealistic son, gross coni—
iiierCialisiii, false morality, the
happy ending, and modern eiitei'aiii—
meat.

The book and lyrics areth funny
and deeply moving, and the music is
fresh, beautiful and haunting. “'l‘ri.
To lteiiieber” is probably the only
iiiodei'ii successful contender to
“September Song."

The youthful silliness, exuber-
ance and idealism of “Metaphor”
and “Much More” progress through
“This Pluiii Is Too Ripe” and inel—
low iiito sincerity and realism in
“There Were You.”

Excellent Cost

The cast did remarkably well in
lifting the cliaracterixatioiis out of
standard types. Bonnie Bradt and
Toni McKee deserve special plaudits
for the great depth and t't)lt\'lllt'lllL’,
quality they gave to their difficult
parts of youth growing unto face
reality.

The Mute (Ken ('ox) played the
best paiifoiiiinie part I have seen
in a long time. At times Dan Walsh’s
voice tended to di'owiiotlt lll(?(ltll(‘l’H,
but this is easily forgiven iiitlie llL’,lit

ally knowing and helping an unfortunate
child. While most individuals and many
groups cannot afford to adopt a child on
their own, it is hoped that students through-
out the University, contributing through the
S. U. News, will be able to raise enough
money to adopt one or more children.
Six Cents to Support a Child

Ours is a large university. If all joined
in this project it would amount to about 6¢
a person to support an unfortunate child and
his family for one year. The S. U. News
will print all photographs, letters and in-
formation that are received from the Child.

All contributions large or small will be
gratefully accepted. Checks may be made
out to S. U. News, Foster Parents, and con—
tributions may be mailedto 750 State Street,

Office, Room 5, Brubacher Hall on Sunday
through Wednesday between 7 and 11p.m.

While the S. U. News would like to raise
the necessary money in time to adopt a
child for Christmas, it istobe remembered
that this aid is not merely a Christmas
gift, but is person—to—person help which
will benefit both the child and the Univer—
sity throughout the year.
