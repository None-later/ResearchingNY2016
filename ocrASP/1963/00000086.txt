Albany-the City m

by John Marion

und Us

Some of you may have seen and even read the
present series of articles in the Knickerbocker
News called “City Within a City.” It is an attempt
to publicize the plight of the Albany Negro, both as
a group and as individuals. While this is anoble
aspiration, the results do not measure up to the
standards of good journalism. The reporter evidently
was a bit lax in his research because many statements
he made are, at least in part, erroneous.

He makes the statement that by the time he is
twelve, the Negro child realizes he doesn’t “have a
chance.” It takes a Negro child of less than average
perception to take 12 years to realize his position.
A Negro girl I know has a three-year-old sister who
already has realized what goes on and has decided
that she doesn’t want to be a Negro.

He also makes the statement, “Among Negro youths,
there’s no such thing as a private party. Everyone
crashes everybody else’s affair.” This statement is
an unjust generalization. As with most other people,
Negroes have both open and closed parties.

Some are for anyone who wants to come and some
are strictly by invitation. His assertion makes it
sound like Albany Negroes have no sense of privacy;
this is simply not true.

I could go on, but the situation is this: the repor-
ter refuses to see some problems that do exist and
when speaking of others, makes generalizations about
the Negro which are simply not true or true only in
the sense that they apply to Negroes and Whites alike.

By all means, read the series, but keep a highly
critical eye open at all times, especially when you
read generalizations about the Albany Negroes.

If you want to learn about Albany’s Negroes, talk to
.some of them or talk to a Negro social worker who
lives in Albany—not a white who commutes from the
suburbs to fulfill his part in alleviating the “white

man’s burden.”

The Albany Institute of History and Art on Wash—
ington Avenue between Dove and Swan Streets now
has three very interesting exhibitions available to
the public: a sculpture exhibit, a set of Eskimo
prints, and a show of paintings. And it’s free!

United Nations Violatos Sovereignty of South Africa

By llrging Immediate Release of Political Prisoners

by Gary Luczak

The United Natiotts in voting last
week (106-1) to censure the Repub-
lic of South Africa has taken a step
that, in all probability, cottld mark
the beginning of the end of the UN
as an effectiye and respected inter-
national forutn.

The resolution re-
quested tlie immed-
iaic release of 11
South Africans
. chargcd wi h con-
' ,‘ spiring against the
,fi gov c r ttiiieiit and
A "_ h urged Prime .\lmis-
ter \‘anwoertl’s ad-
ministration “to grant unconditional
release to all politital prisoners
and to all pcrsons lllllll'lSttllt‘tl. iti—
tcrned, or 'sllltjt’t‘ietl to otht-i rc-
strictions for haying opposed tho
policy of the apartheid.”

This action constituch wholly tin—
warranted and tilt-gal intcrfcrencc

l‘dll'lltt’l‘lllttlt’, it is a dangerous

be not misconstrue my thoughts
as being ait endorsement of the
South African government’s racist
policies; btit otir abhorrence of the
aprtheid theory must not bliiitl its
to the critical legal question pres-
ently under discussion.

Just where the dividing line ho~
tween domestic and international
jurisdiction lies is an immensely
iittportatit problem for the future
of the United Nations.

Although this question of domes-
tic Jurisdiction has cotiic up many
times ill the past, their isaspccific
consideration that must be taken
into account with regard to thc
present case concerning South
Attica.

During the Hungarian dclnto of
1030, a Security t'onncil l'f‘Sttlll-
tioii culling lot the withdrawal of
Soyict trooops, and the ccs'siition

With regard to SotithAfrica,there
can be no question as to the legiti—
macy of the government now iii
power or to the fact that its judicial
system and code of laws lies es-
clnsively within the domestic realm
of this sovereign state.

The present government was
elected under thoprovisionsof'Soutli
Africa’s more than half a century
old constitution (albeit discrimina—
tory in sortie respects).

The UN’s demand that she rc—
leasc several political prisoners
charged under their constitution with
attempted overthrow of the govern-
mom can no more be acceptcd iy
them than it would be by the Soviet
Union. or for that mailcr,the United
States.

I think I can safcly assnmc that
