STATE UNIVERSITY NEWS. FRIDAY. OCTOBER 18, 1963

Potter Blanks KB, fD—D; Defense Deciding Factor!
APA Smashes Cave-Ins, SlS Stymies APA foense

This AMIA football league is
tough! Last Wednesday’s KB-EEP
contest is considered by most ob-
servers to be the roughest game
ever played in AMIA history.

Four or five men were injured
in the brawl. Among the casualties
were Keith Costello (KB), Bernie
“Skeets” Carroll, Toril Macaiuso,
and Dick Odorizzi (EEP).

Defensive Might

The game was mostly an exhi-
of defensive might. Potter’s de—
fensive line was amazing, scoring
two safeties in the last half. Out-
standing liiie men were “Otto” Vo-
maska and Toni Macaiuso for Potter
and Lance Anderson and Larry
Thomas of KB.

Potter’s lone touchdown came on
a deflected pass frorii Camarata to
Weeks. The ball glanced off ttvo

other players before falling into
Weeks’ hands in the end zone.

APA Romps 58-0, Ties 0-0

The men of APA put on a display
of passing, running and defense last
Thursday, completely annihilating
the Cave In’s 58-0. Dori Sinclair
scored three touchdowns for APA
on passes from Bill Burnett.

On defense, APA usually had an
optiori...whether to intercept a pass
or nail the Cave-In quarterback for
a ten yard loss.

Tuesday told a different faJe.
SLS managed to hold APA to a 0-0
tie. This surprised everyone; just
compare the teams’ showings
against the Cave Ins.

The game moved up and down the

field on a series of interceptions.
Anastas, Groul aiid Richardson iii—

 

tercepted for SLS. Sinclair, Burnett
and Goldstein for APA.

Rugged Defense

APA moved to SLS’s 15 yard
line twice in the game. Burnett’s
interception carried to the SL8
twenty and APA couldn’t make the
first down.

The second scoring opportunity
came late in the game when Gold—
stein intercepted at mid-field. Bur-
nett quickly hit Hickey for 15 yards
and Zahui‘ak for 15 more. SLS diig
iii and managed to hold as the fiorn
sounded ending the game at a 0-0
tie.

Plgmy League

The first game in the 155 lb.
league history was played last week
as APA beat KB, 2-0. Don Mason
flashed in from his defensive posi-
tion to nail the KB quarterback be-
hind the goaliiie for two points.

In other action the Independents
defeated Waterbury 13-6 on passes
from Neil Talliis to Steve Freed-
man aiid Dick Fairbank. This week
APA vs. Waterbury arid tiie Iride-
peridents vs. KB.

HAMMING
IT  by Ron Hamilton

 

Bodies are beginning to pile up on the AMIA foot—
ball field. The brand of football that the guys are
playing can be described by one word: bloody. The
blocking and tagging are not to be considered un-
sportsmanlike, only hard and spirited. The question
arises, however, is the game getting too rough to
be played without equipment?

Injuries are at an all time high with half the season
gone. Head protectors like the kind used in wrestling
might make the game safer for all concerned. We
hope AMIA will think about it before the game is
declared too dangerous and banned.

Basketball Is Here Again

Basketball practice begins tomorrow for the var-
sity candidates. Actually the team has been working
out on University Field doing isometric exercises
and running with weights. Doc Sauers says that he
is pleased with the results so far. He said (with a
wry grin), “They will be doing some other work.”
Could it be connected with the staircase in Page Gym?

Love That Support
The support this week was simply great, We are
pleased to see our fans taking an interest in our

teams so far.

The men are giving everything they

have to show their appreciation. We want to see this
kind of enthusiasm for the rest of the yea ‘ and not
an abroupt end after Rivalry is over.

2nd Ranked Bridgeport Blitzes Peds 3|ENA, A NEW RECORED fan ROBBY
Harriers Take RPI TriangularMeet

The Siena Cross Country team fell victim to the strong Albany State runners.
Led by Tom Robinson, as usual, the Harriers posted a 21—37 victory.

Robinson led at the mile mark and went on to shatter his own Siena course by
16 seconds. Breaking records is beginning to be the rule rather than the exception
with the quiet red head. Rimning easily Tom ran the 3.5 mile course in 17:15.2.

Siena’s Chuck Connolly finished second with Dennis Tuttle a strong third and
John Clark fourth. Ken Kirik was named Albany’s runner of the week for his fine
performance in taking fifth place for Albany and insuring a Ped victory. Kirik was
given the responsibility of splitting Siena’s 2nd and 3rd runners.

Flanagan, flawe

State’s varsity Stlt't‘Oi‘ squad stif-
fei'ed its third defeat of the season
last Tuesday at the hands of an
aroused RPl team. The final score
was 4-1.

The State hooters, who have been
having their problems sooriiig this
year, were unable to pierce the
tough RPI defense.

Only once, midway through the
first quarter, were the Peds able
to lift paydirt, when Tom Jones
irioved in off tiio wing and (‘UltliOt'tt‘tl

The outstanding men on defense
