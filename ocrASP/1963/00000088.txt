Saying Very Funny Things
(from All University Reception)

Taken from two cartoons by Jules

“I found a flower.”

“My flower is big...and beautiful...
and extremely robust.”

“Your flower is dark, and ungainly
and might not live till morning.”

“I love my flower for all its rich-
ness arid grandeur.”

“WHAT spiritual values?!!”

“Just because my flower is bigger,
it can’t have poetryll??”

“Are you calling my flower a
dilettaiite??!!”

“I suddenly feel like beatittg your
flower over the head with my
flower."

“I apologize — I have a vulgar
flower.”

“You should have been alive where
we used to live—-before the project.
"Omrtainly. Like now, in Lie
middle of the day—if you want an
apple or sotnething—yvhadda ’yadoll
“\Vell, O'K'n

“Well, before you were alive, you
know how I used to get an apple?”
“I’ll stop—playing for a minute——
itt front of our house—where I al-
yvays played, and I’ll look up to
the window, aiid I’ll vell, “MOMMA,
COME to the WINDOW,”

“Well, where we used to live, it
was ottly the third floor. Well,
anyway, Momma would come to the
window, and I’d yell, “Throw me
down ait apple, MOMMA—and she’d
throw me an apple.”

“If '.ou like apples now—you should
just try them after they’re thrown
down frotti the ’I‘IlIRl) FLOOR!"
“I pity on children who were borti
