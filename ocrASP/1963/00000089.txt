Ioulnalism Courses Needed

We find the lack of planning for any journalism
classes on the new campus as being unfortunate for
both the S.U. News and the student body on the whole.

When this institution was engaged in strictly train—
ing teachers, journalism classes, of course, never
really fitted into the picture. But now that we are be—
coming a diversified university, we feel there is a
definite place, not to mention need, for some formal
instruction in journalism on this campus.

Journalism is one of the most honored professions
in the country today. And while it is a field that has
contracted immensely in the past twenty years, there
is still room for talented young writers. As what will
be one of the largest representatives of the State
University of New York, we feel Albany should in—
clude journalism in its curriculum.

We do not call for a full—blown school of journal—
ism. What we do ask for is the addition of say a
half—dozen journalism courses to the English depart—
ment.

We think that such a move would be of great bene-
fit to the S. U. News. We shall continue to press for
just such a move.

As in the past, Rivalry has come un-

as being childish, silly, out-dated, and
unworthy of a big university.

It has been predicted that Rivalry will
not live to see the new campus.

If this were to happen,
nothing short of a great tragedy.

We are a college in transition. But
while we must put most of our efforts
into looking toward the future, we should

not forget our past.

Rivalry is one of our oldest traditions,

dating back forty years.

Tradition is important to any college;
it is particularly important to a college
like ours which is undergoing such tre-
mendous changes in every phase of its

existence.

Sigma Alpha dipllon
Writes iler ‘Parents’

The following is the translation of a letter from Sigma Alpha's
eleven-year old Korean orphan whom the Sisters have supported

through the Foster Parents' Plan since February, I963.

The

Sisters have received great satisfaction from helping this under-
privileged child for the past few months and hope that their Fos-
ter Parents’ program can be expanded in the next few years.

Dear Foster Parents:

August. 1963

How have you been, dear foster parents? I am so
glad to write to you once a month. School is over for
summer vacation. How are you spending your sum-
mer? Here, on July 25, our school is over and on
September 2, our school will open.

Owing to your love and kindness, all of us are
doing well over here. Last month, I thankfully re-
ceived the monthly cash grant 1,037.60 Won ($8.00)
besides 10 yrds of poplin and a dress thru the Plan.

With the money, we bought school supplies and
living necessities. We also bought some books. We
pray that all of you will be happy and in good health

as always.
Maybe,

we will be able to send you our family

picture next time. So long, dear foster parents.

Lovingly,
Jung 0k Jun
