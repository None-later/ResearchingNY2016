The Men Who Have Cost Their Shodovs Upon State’s Histon

EDITORS NOTE: This is the
third in a series of articles deal-
ing with State's "Transition"—

its past, present, and future.

by Dave Jenk s

The gradual evolution of State
from a small, experimental Normal
School to a University of growth has
been the product of the efforts of
many hundreds and thousands olfac-
ulty members, administrators, stu-
dents, and educators who have been
associated with its 120 yearbistory.

Yet above this mass stands a small
group of ineit, true leaders, whose
influence as individuals, as educa—
tors, and as administrators, has
cast a definite shadow on State’s
past and a ligtit towards its future.

State's First Leader

The first of these men must of
necessity be David P. Page, the
first principal of the Normal School.
The son of a farmer, Mr. Page was
as humble and as unpretentious as
the school he headed.

A resident of New Hampshire as
a youth, he was expectt-d bt hispar-
ents to he a tiller ot the soil, and
any attempt he made to obtainafor-
iiial education was discouraged by
them. A few years in the district
school near his home andlessthana
year in the Hampton Academy were
the extent of his formal education.

After only a few years as a tea-
cher, his ability as a lecturer
brought him to the attention of
Horace Mann who recommended
Page for the principalship of the
Normal School.

There could not have been a man
more dedicated than David Page to
the building tip and establishing of
this new adventure in teacher educa-
tion. Working not only as an adminis—
trator, but also asateachci' hecoin-

pletely engrossed himselfin the task
of defending and supporting the
Albany Normal School.

A Personal Magnetism

When school was not in session
Page traveled the State defending and
talking for his school. “So great was
his personal magnetism that it was
said that one merely had to look at
the residence ofthe Normal School’s
students to tell where he had spent
his vacations.”

“Worn otit by his service and work
of organizing, maintaining, and de-
fending the Normal School, David
Perkins Page caught pneumonia and
died on January 1,1848. For several
years no one of Page’s caliber was
found, yet the impetus which he had
injected in the four short years of
his presidency was enough to keep
the school going.

The next 20 years witnessed 4
new presidents. The first three,
George Perkins, Samuel WooIWorth,
and David Cochran were excellent,
but moved on to higher positions.
The fourth was an Oliver Arey who
was forced to resign when“he could
not get along with the faculty.”

Presidential Prestige

The next fifteen years (18137—
1882) saw Dr. Joseph Alden as the
President of the Normal School.
While these were “generally un—
eventful years 111 the history of
the school,” Dr. Aldon stands out
for the prestige and dignityhe added
to the position of the presidency.

lie was tleSCl'lltt’tl as “sensitive,
impulsive, [JUSltht'. impatient of
contradiction, a \"olulltiltous writer,
a clear thinker, With a college re—
cord as professor and president for
32 years.” 1113 was a111a11111“‘seve1'e
dignity” and 1t hasbeensaidthat due
to this he was less successful as an
adininistraloi' than as a teacher and
writer.

Upon Dr. Alden’s resignation in
18' A Dr. Edward P. Waterbury was
elected to the presidency. It is an
interesting note that he “was the
first president to have a completely
smooth-shaven face, all his sixpre-
decessors having either full beards,
or at least, as in the case of Dr.
Alden, btish sideburns.”

“The Waterbury regime was
marked by four major events - the
reorganization of the aluiniil as-
sociation, the compilation of a his-

 

 n

 

 

 

 

torlcal catalog of the graduates of
the Normal Scho l, the construction
of the Willett Street building, andthe
installation of a kindergarten de-
partment.”

Physical Education Stressed

Dr. Waterbury was also a strong
advocate of physical education, but
while he did seek an appropriation
for the construction of a physical
education and manualtrainingbuild-
ing, it was not forthcoming.

Upon the death of Dr. Waterbury,
William J. Milne was given the
presidency. He had formerly been
principal of the State Normal Sctiool
at Geneseo.

Dr. Milne’s most significant con-
tribution was the raising of the
normal School's standards and the
definition of its purpose.

“Dr. Milne thought that the mosr
singular advantage of his plan was
the singleness of purpose in the
Normal College. He held that the
student’s time, his thought, and his
interest would be all occupied in
the professional courses, and his
ambition Would be to excel in teach—
itig rather than 111 scholarship."

It was during Dr. lt‘lilne’stintethat
the Normal School on Willett Street
burned to the ground. Titus, the
selection ot'a new site and the follow-
ing construction of a new campus
was a significant achievement ofhis
atlininistration.

It was under the Milne regime
that a fotir year program was estab-
lished.

In 1914, Just before thc death of
President Milne the name of the
school was changed to New York
State College for teachers.

25 Years of Dedication
In February, 1915, Dr. Abram
ltoyer llrubacher, a Ph.l). front Yale
University, assumed the presidency
of the college.

“This career in administration
was destined to last nearlyaquarter
of a century, and was to see the
college grow tremendously, both in
material plant and in intellectual
stature. The ground-work had been
laid laboriously through 70 years;
now the tlines were propitious for
further advancement and more ex—
tended service to the state as a
whole.”

The major accomplishments of
the Brubacher administration in-
clude: the obtaining of National
recognition of the college as awell—
established institution of liberal
arts, as well as for the preparation
for teachers; the raising of the
status of the faculty; the institution
of many extra—curricular activities;
the development of a student as—
sociation; the raising of standards
for admission; and the erection of
three new buildings.

Also: the construction of a new
restdence hall for women, the iri-
auguration of a system ofsabbatical
leaves for the faculty; the develop-
ment of extension courses and sum-
mer sessions, and the extension of
the curriculum both in liberal arts
and professional subjects.

While sole responsibility for these
improvements cannot be given to Dr.
Brubacher alone, it was his leader—
ship aiid spirited encouragement
which helped greatly to bring them
about.

A Lasting Impression

Upon his death 111 1939, it was
written that “as much as one man
can, inaquarter (:ellltll‘)‘,lle stamped
his impression deeply upon the State
College for Teachers. Inniany ways,
the institution is, and will long be,
the lengthened shadow of the titan.

“lle fotind it an ordinaryteachers
college with still its normal school
traditions and outlooks; be molded
it into one of the pre-cniinent pro-
fessional schools in the nation.”

Already an active faculty member
for 35 years, Dr. John Manville
Suyles asstiiiietl the Presidency in
1939.

While his record as administra—
t1ye head was more than adequate,
Dr. Sayles may hate contributed as
