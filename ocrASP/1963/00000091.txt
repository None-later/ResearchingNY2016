SLS Stuns Powerhouse Potter, 0-0
Waterbury Defense Ove’rruns KB

Waterbury closed in on Potter
Club this week by defeating KB
20-7 while Potter was deadlocked
with SLS 0-0. The APA-Waterbury
contest this week should be a de-
ciding factor in the outcome of
the league.

Waterbury Deleon KB

A strong Waterbury squad,piloted
by Dave “the winger" Jenks and
lacked by a solid defensive line,
outplayed KB 20-7. The turningpoint
of the game occurred in the second
half with KB leading 7-6. Fitzgerald
was punting to Waterbury from his
own forty and a vicious Waterbury
line pushed the KBtine and backfield
into him and the punt was deflected.
Gary Goodreau snatched the pigskin
five yards from scrimmage and was
in the clear, all the way to pay-dirt.

SLS-Pottor Deadlocked 0-0

SLS’s outstanding defensive squad
earned a 0-0 tie for the second week
in a row against top competition.
Although Potter managed to threaten
a few times, the tremendous com-
bination of Bill Angel and Dick
Griffo ﬂashing in from their de—
fensive end positions, pushed Potter
back time and time again.

Fay Richardson knocked down
numerous passes at safety and a
crucial interception by John Vritiak
thwarted one of Potter’s biggest
rallies. He snagged the pass on his
own 35 and twisted back upfield for
10 yards,

   

Comoroto Missing

Potter was handicapped by the
missing Camarata but almost mana-
ged to pull the game out in the last
20 seconds on a T-D pass from
Casey to Mann. However, the play
was called back because of an il-
legal use of hands and the game ended
in a scoreless tle.

APA Leads Junior Division

The lads from APA’s pigmy team
defeated the Discussers (formerly
Independents) 13-0 this week. The
APA defense has yet to have a point
scored against them in three vic-
tories. The outstanding player ofthe
game was Don Mason who starred
both on offense and defense.

Last week, the Discussers aston-
ished KB 13-12 with a touch-down
in the last two seconds on a pass
from Dick Fairbankto John Cianfoni.

Be it known that even though these two pages are
called the sports section, it is still part of the S.U.
News and as such. is subject to the rules and regu-
lations of a newspaper.

Our job is to relate the facts to the readers as
interestingly and accurately as possible. Pom Pom wav—
ing and rah rah school have no place in our stories. We
must confine our emotional support to feature articles
and this column. In the future any slanting will result
from the reporter’s personal zeal and an oversight
by the sports editor. We hope you will understand our
position.

  

On the Subject oi Pom Poms

Gripe, gripe that’s all we ever do. Not really, but
sometimes it seems that way. We do try to give
credit where credit is due, but you never improve by
slapping yourself on the back and saying “what a good
boy am I.”

What has happened to organized cheering at State?
We owe a vote of thanks to the rivalry cheerleaders
for their excellent jobs at the last few games. The
absence of the lovelies with the big gold S is rather
disturbing.

We are now probably one of the only universities
without cheerleaders (and a football team). It looks
bad to say the least. We certainly hope the situa-
tion will be remedied by the time basketball season
arrives. State as the laughing stock of the area schools
is not a pleasant thought.
