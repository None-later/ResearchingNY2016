Pi‘\GE2 STATE UNIVERSITY NEWS. FRIDAY. NOVEMBER 1, 1963

Pressing of Complaints

Since this year has begun, the question
of the newspaper’s continuing conflict with
Dean Hartley and other members of the
administration leads us to examine the re-
lationship of newspaper to administration.

The responsibility of this undergraduate
student newspaper is to provide the students
with “a newspaper, efficient and unbiased,
which will present on a weekly basis the
late st news, inside and outside the University,
which will be of interest.” We are quoting
from our constitution which was approved
by Student Senate.

The job of the administration is to run
the University. We hope this will be done
efficiently,without bias, and fairly.

The problem between any student news-
paper which attempts to represent the pro-
blems of the students and the administration
of the particular college or university arises
when the students begin to investigate his-
toric white washes in a University, such as

our own.

It is not our job to run the University,
but we feel that in keeping with theories about
freedom of speech we have a right to present
our views on the problems which affect the.
students and a right to present a forum for
the grievances of students.

It is in filling this role of presenting
complaints that leads to many dozens of
hours spent in the cubicles of the adminis-
tration. Because we write about grievances,
we have been on occasion called irrespon-
sible. We are supposed to go through endless
hours of inconclusive run arounds, red tape,
and out-of—date procedures.

We are full—time students; our administra-
tors are full-time administrators. We do
not have a week to spend on each problem,
especially when in the past, weeks of effort
have yielded no results.

It seems strange to us that the things
which students complain about currently we re

 

Mailer of Conscience

being complained about when our Senior
members were freshmen, and in most cases
long before any current student arrived.

We can see no reason, for example, why
no one realized that registration would he
the debacle it was, why teachers are al-
lowed to schedule classes on a regular,
although clandestine, basis in the 1:25 hour
on Friday afternoons, or why we still don’t
have a decent number of phones in the
residence halls.

We have complained about such things
as these in the past; we shall continue (to
level all needed criticisms in the future,

As a forum for student opinion we can
do nothing else but press complaints like
these until an answer, one way or the other,
is given. We shall continue in this vein,
for as we see it, it is a matter of consciencc
that we do so.

Perhaps we should despair, for often our
words seem like so much crying in tho
wind. But, fear not, we shall not deSpair.

 

 

Crash Helmets or Drama

We advise any brave souls planning
to attend this weekend’s performance
of the Good Woman of Setzuan to come
equipped with miner’s cap, crash hel—
met, or any sundry other head gear
that happens to be handy.

This whimsical warning is made in
all seriousness, since the way Page Hall
has been over—loaded with lights there
is a definite danger somebody might get
their head crushed this weekend.

We see nothing wrong with adding lots
of color to a play, but when this is

done at the expense of dangerously filling
over-age platforms and bars with heavy
theatre lights, it seems to us that some—
body’s sense of values are warped.

Every theatre light, but one, that is
owned by the University has been pressed
into service this weekend.

Anybody who happens to stumble into
these lights could send them tumbling
to the floor. One of those overage bars
could let go at any time. Let’s hope
everybody gets through the weekend in
one piece.

Student Rights Inlringed Upon

Should students be required to attend
lectures given at night? Mr. Cowley of
the Art Department apparently thinks so.
We think not.

Mr. Cowley required students in one
of his seminar sections to attend the
lecture given by William Seitz in Bru-
bacher last Friday night.

Campus Night also happened to fall
last Friday night. Campus Night is im—
portant to an awful lot of people; it was
important to some of the people in Cow-
ley’s class.

Admittedly, hearing a lecture by Seitz
is also important to art students. But it
seems ridiculous to actually require stu—
dents to go listen to one.

Teachers and administrators are not
required to play the role twenty-four

hours a day. We do not think students
should be forced to be students twmty-
four hours a day.

Seitz’s lecture fits into the category
of the extra—curricular, culturally—uplift~
ing services thatarebecomingincreasing-
1y available to students.

It is one thing to make such lectures
available; it is quite another to require

Alden ‘Adopts’

Nine- Year Old

Gives Her Chance For School

Alden Hall has recently sub—
Scrlbed to the Foster Parents’ Plan,
adopting a nine—year-old girl, 'I‘er-
esa Coppola, from Italy. The follow-

ing article is an account of her
case history.
Teresa’s home is in Ponticelli,

a suburb of Naples, where over—
population and under—employinent
make life very difficult, at best.
When Teresa’s father died of can-
cer two years ago, her mother was
left destitute with four children to
support.

Needy Family
Teresa’s sister Luisa (16) stays

‘ .
‘f
I -‘

Alden Foster Child, Tere

home to care for the family and
household while the mother is work-
ing. She has a job of a farm hand on
the little land owned by the child’s
paternal grandfather, who, in turn,
is supporting Teresa’s family.

The grandfather’s pension of
$16.10 a month is barely enough for
them. As the children grow older
and their needs and living expenses
increase, thetask ol'supportingthem
is becoming impossible for the
grandfather.

The mother is particularly anx—
ious for her children to be able to
get an education while they are grow-
ing. There are no other relatives
who can help.

One-Room Home

The mother and her children are
living in one room, the property
of the grandfather. The room has
one window and a balcony. It is
rather well lighted and ventilated,
but there is no running water.

Teresa is a tall, slender, little
second-grader, with brown hair and
eyes. Lively, talkative, and cheer-
ful, she shows a certain talent for
embroidery and sewing. She likesto
play handball, although she has no
toys of her own and would lo\e to
have a doll.

The Plan Will provide Teresa
with $8.00 a month, special medical
care, some food and clothing, and
the chance to continuehersclmolmg.
The kind assistance ainfein-oui'aging
friendship of Alden Hall Will extend
to Teresa 2i more secure, happier,
and brighter childhood and future.

The following is a copy of a letter the inhabitants of Alden Hall
recently received from their foster child, Teresa.

September, 1963

Dear American 'Toster Parents,
Alden llall Association (S.U.N.Y. at Albany)

My dearest foster parents, I gratefully thank you
for the L. 4960 monthly allowance that l have re-

ccived.

This is the first time that i am writing you, and
therefore I inform you that my name is TCI‘CSL
Coppola, and I am a nine years old girl attending
the third elementary school grade.

My daddy died about 25 months ago.

Dear foster parents, l have a sister and a brother
who are older than I, then comcs l and then a younger

brothe 1‘.

’I‘hankings and wishes from my mother, my sister,
and my two brothers and many dear and big kisses

from me.

Your loving foster child,
