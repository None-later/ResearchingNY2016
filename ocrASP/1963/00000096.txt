the sun“ can: I'Kiss of the Vampire’ Superior

by Libby Stroud

Too often, as overworked, over-pressured stud-

dents, we slump into a

lethargic existence. We

resolve ourselves to the drabness everyone acknow-
ledges, and don’t probe any further. Such a passive
acceptance of the superficial, a refusal to admit to
the existence of exciting elements around us, is
reflected everywhere. Studies are done, not attacked

with enthusiasm;

are attended mandatorily;

seen, or heard, or noted.

social and educational functions

beauty is passed, not

How many of you, for instance, have noticed the
sun filtering through a puff of burning leaves —
or smelled the woodsy smoke? If you have, did you
do so without joining in the groans and complaints
so sophisticatedly considered the “in” reaction?

It’s so much less demanding to grope along, avoid—
ing the possible pain concurrent with observation.
Just wrap yourself in a buffeting cloud of impercep-
tiveness, and drift — but remember while drifting
is effortless, it’s also unrewarding, meaningless,

and shallow.
Admittedly,

you never see the discarded beer

cans and papers that destroy a scenic View, but you
also miss the outline of approaching winter, inked
starkly against the sky, and softened by a single
clinging leaf. You never see the tear fighting not
to be shed, nor do you see the fullness of unspoken
joy. You never hear the horrible beauty that prompts
“..... a bird screams in the night, and soft, cat-paws

retreat

in feathered gluttony.” You never.....live.

The Good Woman of Setzuan, the
first of four State University Theatre
productions this year to bepresented
by the Dramatics and Art Council,

they make use of nunierotis theatri—

that demands an answer.

The result is an unusual anti

type that is not oftett tirade available

It lacks the main

this devitalizes the picture con-

To Short Rivalry Period

by Skip Schreiber

The freshman class always seems
to get stuck with a worn-out theme
like “Isn’t State Great?” or “Big
League Schools Have Nothing On
Us!” or “How Can You Upstaters
Stand Living iii the Sticks (anti
vice vei‘sa with suitable changes)?"
or “I Wish Rivalry would go oti
forever!”

This year the Class of ’67 sub-
jected us to the first three, and
I can’t help but feel that we’re
not much better off than before.

In the first place, it would re-
quire an extremely talented writer
to spread thirty or forty tninutes
entertainment over ten scenes.

As it was, the skit turned out
to he a collection of skits extremely
loosely held together by a group of
guys playing cards.

And then top off this with a
letter from Albany State that reeks
oi sentimentality and third-rate soap
opera, arid the result iriakes you
wonder how tnuch of this the fresh—
men really believe.

Fair Acting

The general acting was fairly
good, and sortie oi the characteri-
zations deserve special commenda—
tioii, notably Zelda anti the beat.

Although tlte two leads (Miles
Moody and Dennis Martin) were
fairly good actors, their Voices
Were not tip to the heavy demands
of the music which at times tiiade
me wonder if the appearance of
Brunlnlde and a few other Wagner-
ian characters was itntriineiit.

The production ntitnbers,liow—
ever, were excellently handled.
Some of the litres and satire were
clever (e.g., C.P. Slush), but most
fell flat because the actors ncg—
lectt-d to pause for the laughs.

Perhaps the fairest thing to say
about the brush skit is that it was
one notclt abovetypically~freshmen,
but not enough above to be at all
stimulating. Mathenext year’s frosh

daced a tnore tightly written skit.
But that was not the case.

There was improvement over the
frosh skit, however: the sophs had
only nine scenes. Throughout the
skit I had the feeling that the feud
betweenalhe gods and goddesses
was only a classical cover-up for
ltivalry, and that we were allwatcli-
ing a fresh skit iii disguise.

There was, however, the stnooth
appearance and slight tomb of pro—
fessionalism which the sophs are
generally able to put on. Bill even
this and the superb characterization
of Bacchus by Bill Laundry couldn’t
quite pull the show together.

Just as the gods and goddesses
were about to patciiuptlieirtroubles
and go back to the orgy, Aland
Bunny get into Bact-lrie’s, start the
Big B, and twist right into the
finale.

There was soitietliing missing,
arid I got the feeling that the script
typist had forgotten to put in the
last scene.

Orgy on Stage

Tire entire cast was very good
and the staging at times was very
imaginative: it’s not every day
that someone puts an orgy oti stage!

The characters occasionally tetr—
ded to slow down the music. and
I’m still trying to figure out how
a nuclear reactor got itito a song
about love on eartlt. All iii all,
the sophs presented a very enyoy—
ablc skit.

And so, the ltivalt'y skits are
over for another year, but tlieques—
lion keeps recurring: Is it worth
putting oti another set of them next
yearl‘ Under the present set-up the
answer can only be “No,”

It is insanity to fititik that a
skit tan be pttt on iii than
four weeks, especially a skit which
is expected to lit? as technically
elaborate as those were.

Facilities Inadequate

The facilities available both on
the stage and ill the shop Will
not allow fotir groups to be Work—
lltyJ, simultaneously. The skits have
long since stopped being skits and
have become small musical pro—
dtictions.

Ittss

Not only is Wilde’s French accent
absurd, but the dialog provided is
awkward and self-consciously medi-
eval. The battle scenes, the film’s
strongest point, are nevertheless
excessively bloody and often in bad
taste.

Superior Film

The second feature, however,
avoids lapses of taste and is, in
every department, a superior
achievement. Made by the British
Hammer Films, Itic., it is quite the
best of that coinpany’s many well-
produced features.

The tone of the entire picture is
set during a pre—credits “teaser”
in which a strange, bearded man
watches a country funeral. After the
wooden casket has been lowered in—
to the grave he takes a spade and
hurls it, like a spear, at the coffin.

It pierces the Wood and the body
beneath, a screairi is heard and blood
is seen vvelling tip through the
splintered lid.

riginal Vampire Story

It would be a disservice to des-
cribe the plot, except to say that
the hero and lteroine are honeymoon—
itig iti Bavaria, at the turn of the
century, and that it concerns vam—
piristn arid detiioriology,

As a vampire story, it is the
most original andvvell-writtensince
Brant Stoker’s Dracula. It is log-
ical, within the limits of its fati—
tastic nature, and unpredictable,
quality rare iii this sort of thitig.

Technically and artistically the
film is excellent. The actors, not
vveil known, provide characters who
develop during the film, and there-
fore in whom we can believe.

Don Sharp’s direction isjust that -
sharp, fluent, with never a wrong
camera placement. Before becoming
a director ire must have been a
photographer. for be has a carriera-
man’s flair for the composition and
arrangement of each scene.

Eerie Opening

The very first shot, of the funeral
procession passing behind a bare,
twisted free, sets the standards of
quality which the rest of the film
maintains.

The entire production is in a low
key and, tinlike tnany such pictures,
never gets otit of liartd. Pace is
perfectly controlled throughout, arid
the result isariiood film that creates
a genuine aura of fear and dread.

A comparison oi this picture to
llaininer’s Horror of Dracula, made
five years earlier. shows the artis-
HF and professional maturity of
the studio.

Great Pains Taken

The earlier filrti sacrifices tiiood
for niotnonltrttt and shock effect.

ALLEGED MISBEHAVIUR CAUSES STUDENTS’ DISMISSAL

Editor's Note: The following article dealing With the 28- 0“

recent dismissal of two Potter men from the Univer-
sity represents a compromise of this paper’s editorial
policy of naming names.

The names of those students involved are being with—
held by the 5. U. News to protect them. This is being
done at the request of President Collins, who suggested
that it would be wrong to put a peririanenf strike in
life against these men by printing their names.

it v r t v t * at:

Two State University students were dismissed Friday
for alleged assault on an Albany citizen. Two others,
who also took part iii the incident, were placed on social
probation.

All four lllell are members of Potter Club Fraternity.
Potter is presently considering, iii accordance with
its Constitution, removing them froin the club. No final
action will be reached for two weeks.

At the present time, the University contemplates no
action against Potter Club as a unit.

The incident which prompted Presidetit Collins’ action
of dismissal took place on State Street, where the Potter
house is located. on the evening of Monday, October

that night, heavy drinking had taken place in

the Potter house in celebration of welcoming new upper-
class pledges.

Takes Place on State Street

As re—constructed frotri testimony given by the four
men involved, and four outside witnesses, the incident
began when a pedestrian walking down the Washington
Park side of State street saw a Potter man urinating
iii the street.

He dressed the Potter man down, calling him a “bar-
contlnued on his way down State.
The Potter man went back to the house, and with three
others, jumped liito a car “to riiake him apologize.”

They overtook the man iii front of the Albany Pharmacy
Building. At this point, testimony is not too clear, but
what apparently happened was that the man was roughed
up by two of the Potter men.

The appearance of a taxi cab. that was apparently
mistaken for a police car, scared the Potter tiieri off.
The police were called to the scene by witnesses, but
time they had arrived, the State students had
cleared out.

Editorial

A Fair Shake

The actions taken by President Collins in dismiss—
ing the two men of Potter from the University raise
the ever—reappearing question of the letter of the
law vs the spirit of the law.

Obviously, certain basic English common law rights
were violated in the procedures used. The students were
not allowed to face thei i accusers. The four witnesses
brought against them testified in private to President
Collins and Dr. Hartley. The names of these witnesses
have not been revealed.

On the face of this, itwould seem these students were
not given an even chance to defend themselves. This
we believe, is the opinion of the majority of the stu—
dent body.

We go on record now as saying that, quite to the
contrary, these students received more than a fair
shake. In a very real sense, they were given every
break in the book by the administration.

The reason for the hush—up of the whole affair
was literally to protect the guilty, as well as the
innocent. What these students did could have been a

case for the Albany police. lithe man they had allegedly
assaulted wished to press charges, they would have
been doing their explainii'ig in it court of law, not
President Collins’ office.

It is President Collins’ genuine wish that these
students should not be hurt any more than they have
already hurt themselves. On their records it will
state that they were dismissed from the University;
the word expel does not even ttpj'iozir.

lly doing this, these men will not be damned for
the rest of their lives because of one, very serious
mistake,

We have decided to co—operate with this very humane
policy. The above news article on the incident does
not contain any names, and very low specific facts.
it might be, and will undoubtedly be, asked, isn’t this
a travesty of objective jourmtlism‘.’

Perhaps it is. But any university newspaper is
inevitably torn between conflicting responsibilities.
On the one hand We have a responsibility to provide
the student body with solid news r'opoi'tinr; on the
other hand We have just as solid a responsibility
not to set ourselves up as gods, judging thclives
of our students.

it is a difficult path to walk. ()ur decisions must,
of iiecassity, vary from taste. to case. As faras
these students are concerned, We have reached our
decision. The case is closed,

Conference Reveals That President

Holds Unique Veto Powers

A report given to Student Senate revealed that Albany State’s student taxis

one of the

lowest in the State University system. The student tax at State for

this year is $42.50. At Fredonia the tax is $68.00, at Oswego, $57.00, at Geneseo
$90.00 and at Cortland $50.00. These figures include class dues which, if included
in the tax here, would bring Albany State’s tax to $44.50. The report came to

The report set tip the minimum
requirements for the appropriation

Several Senators objected to the
fact that money Would be taken from
Strident Tax and awarded to three
students, Senator llawe countered
by saving that all students have an
equal chance to Will the scholarship
as all students have air equalchance

little actual student control over

by the students through their govern-
ment. This contrasts with the sys-

Veto Uncommon

The assembled representatives of
the units of the State University
We re surprised to hear of the
budgetary veto winch was imposed
at State early this year.

Albany is the only participating
university or college which has a
presidential veto written into its
constitution.

(The president With the veto is
the President of the University,
not the SA President.)

The supposed grounds for the
refusal to raise student tax were
the added costs of college due to
tuition, the lateness oi the request,
and the method of request.
