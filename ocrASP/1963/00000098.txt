STATE UNIVERSITY NEWS. FRIDAY. November 8. '1963

[MYSKANIA Reports Activities

  MYSKANIA would like to submit this report on

Recommendations

Upon consideration of the tradi»
tional function ofConvocation, MYS-
KANIA recommended on November 4
that the original meaning be re-
tained.

They declared that Convocation
should serve as the calling together
of the members of the University
community.

Since the administration of this
function has been delegated to the
Student Association, MYSKANIA re-
commended that these student rep—
resentatives should partake in the
program.

The official report went on to
say, “a University in transition
is one in danger of losing many
things. The traditions which have
grown through generations of stu-
dents cannot be discarded without
serious detriment to the Univer-
sity.”

“MYSKANIA feels that in this
particular issue the present student
body must work toward insuring
the continuation of tradition.”

prepare their budgets. In most otller

schools the amount of time is less

and the final report does not go

to the President of the University.
Other Topics

Other topics covered were tui—
tion, Who’s Who elections, and Frosll
Orientation.

A letter was sent to the Board
of Trustees urging that the unit
at which tuition is charged receive
seine benefit from the charge. It
was considered to be a hopeless
request, but was lnade anyway.

In reference to Who’s Who, many
colleges do not elect their fllll
assigned quota. In many cases there
is no election by the general stu-
dent body. There is considerable
faculty control in sollle colleges.

With regard to orientation of
freshmen, most other units have
lnore informal procedures with
some units having no program atall.
At li'redonia. it was admitted that
the fresh do riot get to know the
upperclassnlen.

its current activities to the student body.

The entire area of judicial procedure is being
re-examined with the purpose of establishing a more
efficient judicial system on all levels — to provide
means for review and appeal to higher courts. This
Judicial Review committee is composed of DiRocco,
Tyo, Leo, Jenks, Stroud and Murphy and is working
for the present as well as anticipating the future.

A second committee is concerned with a revision
of the University Code of Honor. The incident at
Cortland last spring caused many members of this
University to search for the causes underlying such
an occurence. MYSKANIA feels that an answer to
this question would prove valuable to the entire student
body. Cortland is seen as but a small part of a larger
perspective and one involving each and every member
of our small society, the University community.

What are the moral standards of this Campus? How
do they relate to the society in which we live? How
do personal morals change in the years at college?
What are the most significant influences on the individual
in his development and redefinition of standards?

All these questions are of great concern to all
members of this campus. This committee hopes to
successfully evaluate student opinion in this area
and would welcome suggestions from any student or
faculty member who wishes to contribute.

Smaller committees have worked on defining the
traditional value of some older University functions
such as Convocation. The report of this committee
is presented in this issue.

Rivalry has of course been a major concern of
MYSKANIA for the past few weeks and the role of
MYSKANIA in orientation has been partially com—
pleted. MYSKANIA remains class guardians, however,
until the class elects their own officers in February.

The secret nature of MYSKANIA has always been
of primary concern to the student body. In an effort
to dispel the various misgivings which traditionally
arise, MYSKANIA — 1963—1964 submits this report
to the student body and requests that anyone who
wishes more information concerning the current func—
tions of MYSKANIA, and anyone who feels that some
other matters are in need of consideration, please make
these known to one of the members.

MYSKANIA is a group ofstudentselectedto represent
the student body in the form of a judicial branch and
guardians of tradition. As representatives, MYSKANIA
feels a responsibility to the student body and hopes
that students will coope "ate in helping them perform
this purpose.

Democrats Are Threat
In Republican Wisconsin

by Joseph W. Gold

In the past weeks, Ohio and North
Dakota have been examined in an
effort to determine if there are any
trends ill partisan politics. There
are several other states which ex-
hibit interesting phenomena. These
states will he examined one at a
time.

Wisconsin is the topic for this
week. Right now Wisconsin has a
Democrat for its governor and two
Democrats for its U.S. Senators.
Four of the ten Congressmen are
now Democrats. Both houses of the
legislature are controlled by rural
Republican constituencies.

In 1960 the stateprovided Richard
Mllllous Nixon with anunimpressive
victory. 1960 is the beginning of
the interesting part of the study.

First Two-Term Democrat

In 1958 Gaylord Nelson was
elected as the first Democratic
governor ill lnally years. In 1060
Nelson becalne the first Democrat
ever to be re—elected governor ln
Wisconsin. l'lis margin was dimin—
islled, but the accolnpllshlnent was
a great one.

In 1062 for the first timeal)emo—
crat succeeded a Democrat to the
State House. The new governor,
Jollll A. Reynolds, was considered
a lackluster candidate. He had been
the Attorney General of the state.

In botll 1960 and 1962,tileltepubli-
cans of Wisconsin ran a far rigllt
wing candidate, Philip A. Kuelnl. ile
came closer to winning ill 1962
than in 1960, but this is not coll-
sidered much of all achievement
by anyone.

Cycle Begun 8- Ended with McCarthy

The recent Republican dominance
of Wisconsin ran approximately
Concurrently with the Senate Iell-
ure of the late Joseph McCarthy.
In 1046 McCarthy defeated Senator

Robert M. Lahollette, Jr. ill the
Republican primary.

Emerging Africa-

A View by an Exchange Student

by Maurice Tsododo

Addis Ababo Conference:

Early this year African Heads of State assembled
in Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia. Their purpose
was to discuss the unification of Africa. While this
is a grandiose scheme at the moment, the pattern

of events

indicate that this vast continent with its

emerging states will one day achieve unity.
The discussions continued for about two weeks.

Proposals and counter proposals

were made, and

from the conference emerged certain noteworthy

decisions.
Destruction of Imperialism:

As a first, step towards unity the African leaders
pledged themselves to the removal of the remaining

vestiges of imperialism.

The attack was mainly di—

rected at Portuguese Territories. To gaintheir goal the
independent states were to give material support to the
pendent states were to give material support to the
freedom fighters of these countries. A fund to be used
for this purpose was created. Uganda even offered
its country as training ground for guerilla fighters.

Economic Market:

Plans were to be drawn up for an African common
market on the same basis as the European common
market. This was to be organized first on a regional

basis.
Foreign Policy:

It was unanimously decided .
States were to present a common policy
This was to

national affairs.

that in future the African
in inter-
be put into immediate

effect bv the African deligation to the United Nations.

Drawbacks:

The main factor detrimental to the unification is the
varying levels of economic development in the different

state 3.

Most of the nations are still in their initial

stages of development, and are thus preoccupied with

their local problems.

But the leaders realize that

Africa has a tremendous role to play in international
affairs — the role of neutrality.

This role can only be effectively carried out if
this giant, strategetically situated between East and

West, is unified.

The leaders will spare no energy

or recourses to gain this end and this will consequent—
ly bring about the realization of The United States of

EDP To Keep Records

  

by Karen Keefer

Located in the peristyle of Lower Draper is a room officially called Electronics
Data Processing. For all practical purposes, however, it can be dubbed simply

the IBM room.

Within the walls that formerly housed gym lockers, are contained

several intricate mechanisms commonly known by their IBM number.
A staff of about ten people, under the direction of Mr. Don Allen, are responsible
for student records, grades, and accumulative records.

Previously, all of SUNY
at Albany’s computer work
was done at the State Edu-
cation Building, However,
that installation is on the
verge of change to an entire
computer system so thatis
was thought necessary to do
the work right here.

Installation Will Grow

As our University becomes lar-
ger. and records become involved
with increased enrollment, our ill-
stallation will grow also.

All illlportallt thing to remember
ill relation to the machines is that
any machine is only as good as
the person is who tells it what to
do. Each nlaclline must be wired
by tile operator ill a very intricate
manner. The whole idea of any IBM
machine is the principle of impulse
timing. This timing is decided by
the man, who can he considered
the master of his machine. Brushes
on the machine pick up the number
of holes which correspond to the
information desired, and so com-
plete their task.

There are several steps involved
ill the colllpletioll of an IBM opera—
tloll depending upon the information
the operator wishes to pill on the
card. A card holds 80 fields and
it is up to the lndlrldual to make
hls own fields up on the card. A
card can hold infol'lllatlon such as
a person’s name, age, address,
and status.

Several Steps Used
The system is known as punch
card programming. A forln is used
to plan the card, the val'lous
machines are Wired. and the opera-
tlon ls begun.

First the card ls put through
the Ke\ Punch or the 402. Don
Ulrike, the tall operator, fields the
cards and Wires the machines.
Operated by Margo Seminary and
Ilildu Scandlon thls lllachlne can
