IEG Presents Great Russian Eihi Tonight

Tonight the International Film
Group will present Alexander Nev-
sky. In Russian, with English sub-
titles, this is a film which has been
included oil several lists of all-
tiine great motion pictures. Indeed,
it is perhaps the most important
picture to be shown here this se-
mester.

Made in 1038, it provides a tran-

A scene from tonight’s IFG film,

sitioii between the two styles of
its director, Sergei M. Eisenstein.
In the early twenties he, and other
Russians interested iii motion pic-
tures, expanded into theories the
techniques of editing exemplified
by Griffith's Intolerance.

They felt that the effect of cut—
ting to manipulate time atid space,
as well as audience reactions, was

 

“Alexander Nevsky"

not generally used -to its fullest
extent. Eisenstein’s first films ——
Strike (I924), Potemkin (I925), Ten
Days that Shook the World (October
I927) and Old and New(The General
Line, 1929) — have become classics
mainly through his creative use of
editing‘.

Planned Documentaries

These films are essentially
planned docuiiientarles. With no
isolated characters, they utilize a
“mass hero.” Potemkln, for iii—
stance, has as its hero the crew
of the Armoured Cruiser Prince
Potentkin, which rebels during the
1905 uprising.

Eisenstein’s second style is il-
lustrated by the tWo par s of Ivan
the Terrible (’44-‘16).

llere editing does nu dominate
as much as before. and tile director
concentrates on the visual composi-
tion of every scene. The result is
photography that can stand by itself
as art.

In addition, these two films pre-
sent lhe character ofoitly one liian —
Tsar Ivan. This individual develop-
ment is very much the opposite of
a “mass hero.”

‘Good Woman’ Generally Good
Technicians and Play Choice Cited

by Skip Schreiber

The problems of living in a hour-
geoise, capitalistic society and of
remaining good iii the face of indif-
ference and opposition have been
bandied about in drama for many
years. It takes a playwright of
Brecht’s stature to put a gloss over
this theme and make it palatable.

The Good Woman of Setxuan is
Shen Te, a prostitute who tries to
be good to those less fortunate than
she. When threo gods descend to
earth, only Shen Te gives them a
rooln for the night. and they re-
ward her with 1,000 silver dollars.

With the “Hull”. she buys a lo—
bacco shop, and her looching friends
and relatives Hunt: in. To kei-p the
shop, Sfien 'I‘e is l‘orccd to mas-
querade as Mr. Shin Ta, her myth-
ical cousin.

Thus unfolds the diclioloiiiy of a
person trying in be good inacapltai—
islic society: Shui Ta is cold, heart-
less, and vei y busiiiesslikc.

Shell 'l'c later ini-cls Yang, a

flyer about to kill himself because
he has no work, and she becomes
pregnant by him. He traps her
into giving him 500dollars,proinis-
ilig marriage. so that he can get
a job lll Peking.

The marriage falls through, the
money is lost, bill Slieii Te as Shui
Ta builds up the tobacco shop ililo
a thriving business.

Threatens Exposure

Yang threatens to expose Sliui Ta
as operating a sweat shop unless
ho turns over llio business. The
polico are called in, and Sliiil Ta
is accused of murdering Shell To.

The three gods intervene asjudg—
cs, Shell 'I‘e reveals her doublo
identity, and the gods return to
heaven, convinced they have found
at least ono good person, Shell Te.

'l‘ho story is unique, and the
satire is biting when iiol obscured
by the poor translation and acting.

The cast was generally iiol up to
tho heavy demands which lti'cchl
placos upon ll. Notablo oxcoplions

larly, they managed to break out

Alexander Nevsky was filmed be-
tween these two periods, and iii-
cludes elements of both. There is
no heavy emphasis oneither tnontage
or composition, and the film is
perhaps more even, and therefore
better, because of it.

Nevsky Submerged

The character ofNevsky, although
dominant whetiover he appearshlocs
not have the depth given to Ivan.
Actually, muchofllie filmeliminates
him, concentrating instead on the
peasants and knights he leads.

The direction is by Eisenstein
and DI. Vassiliev, froiii a script
by Eisenstein and Peter A. Pavlenko.
Edouard Tisse was the photograph-
er, and original music was composed
for the picture by Sergei Prokofiev.

Great Film Genius
Eisenstein died on February 10,
1048, while the third part of Ivan
was still iii the planning stage. A
great talent was lost, the continual

The report stated that “Since
there is a definite lack of interest
on the part of some groups; since
tltcre is liol enough need for a car.

MYSKANIA to Rule on legality
OI Senate Chartering Student Buses

by Irv Carpenter

An infraction of Senate’s legislation, concerning buses chartered for the up-
coming vacation, was brought to the attention ofSenate by Senator Miles. According
to a law passed in Senate last year, Senate has the sole right to charter buses
in the name of the State University of New York at Albany. Several groups on
campus, claiming to be unaware of this legislation, went ahead and posted Sign up
sheets for students interested in traveling on a chartered bus.

They did this without Senate’s consent. Three of these groups refused to submit
to Senate’s ruling upon the request of Services committee. The committee made
several offers to these groups, one of which was to reimburse those involved

open the matter to discussion. These
motions were out of order. The

was passed. The bill states “that
every person wishing lobe elected
to Senate be required to attend at
