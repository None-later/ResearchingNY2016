Earlier Activities Ilay Needed

The Activities Days program was an
unqualified, if somewhat spectacular, flop
last week.

Despite a fine effort by the event’s
committee, and the introductionof several
new means to ballyhoo the program, this
rendition of Activities Day was killed
by the same culprit that killed its pred-
ecessors.

Most freshmen and transfers could
not care less about joining an activity
half-way through the semester.

Rocky Road for llur Hero

Now that New York’s governor in absen-
tz'rz has ended all the suspense and an-
nounced his intentions, we can all breathe
a sigh of relief The rest of the country
will have to put up with him for a while,
giving New Yorkers a well-earned res—
pite from the ever-ready Pepsodent smile.

Our good governor is running for the
nomination despite the heavy odds against
him. The only thing that might make
us sad is that the “Boom for Barry”
might prevent our Nelse from getting
the Republican nod.

We’d really love to see Rocky get
the nomination -- so that he could get
swamped by Kennedy next November.

Unfortunately, it does not look like
he will make it as far as the big show.
It seems that many Republican leaders
have about as much faith in him as we

By the time we get around to holding
Activities Day, those who are really
interested in a particular group have
already joined, and those who have no
particular preferences are already in
a nice comfortable groove.

The solution is obviously to get these
people acquainted with the groups at
a much earlier date than is currently
the case.

Perhaps a program in conjunction with
Frosh Weekend is the solution.

do.

This man, who would like to be Pres-
ident, has shown such complete stupidity
and such complete lack of common sense
in everything he has done in recent
months, that we doubt he will even re—
ceive the nomination.

If, however, he does make it through
some happy circumstance, we want to
make sure he receives all the support
he deserves from his ever—lovingUniver-
sity students.

We suggest that everyone who will
be able to vote next November, think
back to the events of January 1963.
Think back to those many, pleasant hours
spent protesting tuition.

Then, if the need comes, exercise
your rights as free—born, God—fearing,
100% American citizens, and help bury
Rocky at the polls.

No Compromise in Workshops

When the Greek Workshops began last
September, there was a general feeling
of optimism and hope among the Greeks
that the University’s new policiestowards
fraternities and sororities could be made
to work.

Now this optimism is gone. In its
place has appeared the belief that no
matter what the Greeks propose, the
administration is going to get its own
way anyhow, so why bother trying?

The Greeks were given a pretty stiff
list of policies to work within last Sep-
tember. The new rushing and pledging
requirements, in particular, marked a
great departure from previous methods.

The purpose of the Workshops was
supposedly to enable the Greeks to make
the best of the situation; to find the best
way to make the new policies work not
only for themselves but for the Univer—
sity as a whole.

Unfortunately, the administration seems

to think that this primrose path is a
one-way street. Compromise is fine, it
seems, as long as it’s the Greeks who
do all the compromising.

The administration seems determined
to impose its will on the Greeks. Time
and again the efforts of long weeks’ work

have been dismissed as being completely

unacceptable.

There is no effort to see the Greek
point of view. The administration sees
only its own goals (whatever they are)
and drives towards them, the torpedoes
be damned.

The narrowness of this view is rather
bewildering. The only thing it serves to
do is antagonize a Greek community that
in September genuinely wished to co-
operate with the administration.

We suggest the administration rte-eval—
uate its attitudes towards the Greeks. A
bad mistake is being made; it needs
correcting.

Reasons, Not Excuses

At a Sayles dorm meeting last week, the question
of leaving the lounges open all night was raised. To it
the answer was given that the lounges close at 11 pm.
because “all the other dorms do it that way.”

We feel that this excuse

is indicative of an all—

too—common attitude of those in authority toward thc

student body.

A parent does not let “everybody else” decide how
his child will be brought up, yet when students question
a regulation, they often find that what “everybody
else” does has determined what they, too, will haw

to do.

This kind of answer can only foster mistrust lilltl
contempt. President Collins realized this and by I’X-
plaining his actions in the Potter case has helpcd
to clear up a suspicion of administrative kangaroo
court tactics which had existed previously.

Other persons in authority, however, do not think
it necessary to give students sound, logical reasons

for regulations.
If sound, logical

reasons exist, the students h:i\c

a right to know them. If there is no basis other than
custom, then the rule should be evaluated and adapted
to the needs of the particular situziton.

As maturing individuals,

we feel ourselves Cziptiblc

of respecting reasonable regulations, but :is it reason,
“everybody else does it” will not suffice.

Campus thrislain Council to Present
lecture on Modern Sexual Ethics

The Campus Christian Council
will present the second panel dis-
cussion in its “Symposium (in Sex
and Modern Man” on Sunday, Nov.
17, at 7:30 p.m. in BrubacherHall’s
Main Dining Room. The topic for
discussion wil be “Towards a Sexual
Ethic.”

The panel will discuss the new
sexual freedom of the individual
and the problem of what additional
responsibilities, if any, the indi-
vidual must assume. The question
of sexual ethics will also be dis-
cussed.

The purpose of this program, as
indicated in the title, is only to
determine more clearly the prob-
lems involved in establishing asex-
ual ethic and developing a moral
code — not to establish one.

Panelists will be the Rev. Robert
Garvin, a Presbyterian minister
and graduate student at Columbia
University, who has had experience
in the field of sexual ethics, and
Mr. Cadbury of the Philosophy De-
partment. Discussion chairman will
be Guy M. McBride ’65.

The meeting is open to all stu-
dents and faculty of the University.
