AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAA-‘AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Pat Fasano, Skip Schreiber

Since the identity of the Common Staters has been revealed, (the
worth of this maneuver is still to be determined,) you can now feel
free to attack us for anything we print. Our office hours are 3-5 in
the cafeteria. Come and see us anytime. We even haveasuggestion
box. We’re very friendly and we welcome advice. We won’t take it,
but we welcome it.

It’s sad that the main interest on this campus is in Senate’s mis-
takes and not in its accomplishments. You may call Senators “tools”
- but you can’t build a thing without tools. They’re necessary. And
let us not forget that the early “tools” led to the development of the
“wheel.” Dori’t lose heart Senators, somebody’s bound to acknowl-
edge your efforts. . .sooner or later. . .we think. . .maybe. . .well. . .

It’s ironic that sororities whose primary function is to foster friend-
ship, at the same time destroy friendship because the people involved
may be in different sororities. Is it worth it? There is no human being
who doesn’t deserve respect simply because she wears different colors.
Remember girls, a sorority is to build human relations,not break
them down and that’s an adult responsibility not to be ignored.

Hey friends, isn’t it about time we got off the Potter rail?! The
Common Staters do not condone the conduct of the students dismissed
from this school — however we see absolutely no need for the Newspaper
to mention a fraternity - thirteen times — in an article dealing with
individuals’ behavior. Credit where credit is due - and Potter didn’t
“due” it.

The Common Staters award roses and lollipops to the many members
of the student body who contributed toward the Campus Chest drive.
One gets much from unselfish giving - if you haven’t tried it —- you’re
missing something.

The activities on Activities Day weren’t any too active. There are
many freshmen who know little or nothing about school organizations
and they tirade little or no effort to find out. We mean, how long can
you sit in your room without being aware of what’s going on around
you. A wise choice of a single activity can’t hurt, and if you’re tired
of hearing the same old names, you have to do something about it.
Meetings can be fun — try one!

Conventions do wonderful things —like expose Albany State’s unique
distinction of the presidential veto. Sit tigiit kiddies —in time maybe
Oswego or Cortland can help our student government get on an equal
footing.

? of theweek: Are freshmen interested in running for Senate, interested
enough to attend three meetings........

I WAS A TEEN-AGE SLIDE RULE

In a recent learned journal (Playboy) the distinguished board
chairman (Ralph “Hot Lips” Signfoos) of one of our most
important American industrial corporations (the Arf Mecllilll-
icnl Dog Co.) wrote it trenchnnl; article in which he pinpointed
otir single most serious ntitionul problem: the luck of culture
among science graduates.

Let me hasten to state that Mr. Signf'oos’.‘ article was in no
sense derogatory. He said emphatically that the science grad-
uate, what with his gruelling curriculum in physics, mirth, rind
chemistry, can hardly be expected to ﬁnd time to study the
arts too. What distresscs Mr. Sigirfoos—ttnd, indeed, rill of its ~
is the lopsided result of today's scicncc Courses: grntlinitcs
who can build it skyscraper but can't coriiposc a coiiccr'to; who
know Newton's Third lrllw but not llccthovcn's l“t)lll'lli Sym-

 

cit/é irif’irlrry‘; ark/cc

“ ti“, 5 «All;

phony; who are familiar with lt'i'uutiliol‘or's lines but not, with

Slicllcy’s.

Mr. Sigafoos can find no solution to this lttinciiltiblc imbnl—

once. I, however, beliovo thcre is one 7

and it i'ci'y siniplc onc.

It is this: if students of scicnco don’t how time to come to
the arts, thou the arts must conio to studt-nts of science.

For oxnmplc, it would lrc it very crisy thing to touch poctry
and music right along with physics. Students, instcrid of bcing
(:iillcd tipoii iiicrt-ly to recitc, would iiistcttd litf rcquircd to
i'liyiiic tlicir rtiiswci's flll(l sot lllt'ill to l'riiiiilitir tuncs likc, for
instance, tho stirring ('olorrcl Brit/I'll .llrirr-lr. 'l‘hus r'ccitntions‘

the purpose of these publications. In his first editorial in 1916 he wrote, “In

Echo,”

will not see his own, but rather

“the Normal College

the school, “reflectingcollege activities andinterests.”
From this small beginning grew a yearbook, a news-
paper, a humor magazine, and a literary magazme.

State College News -- l9l6

When the State College News was
organized in 1916, Eciio gave up its
news section anti specialized in
stories, essays, plays. and poems.
It was renamed the “quarterly”
in 1918, btit again asstiined the
name of Echo in 1029.

Neon, the predecesSor of today’s
’l‘orivli, was organized in 1900.1t was
commented tliatthe Neon was“one of
the most realistic anti energetic
clubs ever established in this insti—
tution.” However, the resultsdidiiot
seem to match these inspiringWords
and the first atteiript to produce a
yearbook turned otit tobeacompletc
financial failure.

Pedagogue — 1912

No yearbook was again attempted
until 1911 when “Uur Book” was
published. It contained literary
Works and a few pictures. Since
15111 the yearbook has been pub-
lished regularly. Starting in 1912
it was called the l’edagogue, and
the name reitiainod so for 40 years
until it was changed only last year
to 'l‘orcli.

Only one tiriie in State’s history
was the Pedagogue dedicated to some
trite outside of the school —- in 1919
when the honor was given to ’I‘lieo-
tloi'o lttiosei'elt.

Tim 1922 l’edagogue campaigned
for a State (Tolloge Dormitory. In
some iears photopraphi contests
were Hill by the “Pod” staff, and
if) 1940, they began to employ the
extensive tiSti of informal photos.

State’s publication system ex-
perienced its greatest growth in
1011), when on October Al, the Class
of ’18, i‘cpi't-si-ntod by a "Coni-

sanctioned the venture and Dedicke
successfully organized the News.

Christmas. 1926. left State with
a lustily roaring cub known as the
State Lion. Ferocious only through
the Words it printed, the Lion was
the first and onii strictly humor
triagazine iii the college’s history.
Margaret Flanagan and Wallace
Streveli were the organizers with

Miss Flanagan singing songs which
pointed out the needs for a comic
magazine. 'l‘his wcekly warbling at
the student assemblies received
overwhelming response and the Lion
became a reality.

They Weren't Lion

For the first two years, it was
distributed by individual sales,being
published twice each of the years.
It turned out to be a complete
financial, literary, and artistic suc-
cess. In 1026 it became financed
along with the other studciit pub-
lications under the student i‘d‘..

Its motto was, "Rugite cum
Leone” (roar with the lion) and
in 1931 it was forced to do some

roaring. George Rice, tiieii editor
of the State College News tried
to eliminate the Lion’s appropria-
tion, but popular support squelched
his attempt,

Until but!) there were two col—
