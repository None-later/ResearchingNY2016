Play Review

STATE UNIVERSITY NEWS. FRIDAY.

‘lhe Stronger’ Highlights Four
Generally Good All Presentations

by Skip Schrelber

A one-act play often tends to
an extreme: either it has little
plot and characterization and drags
on, or it suddenly stops just when
it starts to get going.

“The Tiny Closet,” by William
Inge, lies at the first extreme.
Concerned with the interactions of
a landlady and her rather sensitive
boarder who makes hats in his spare
time and locks them in his closet,
the play never goes anywhere and
attempts to hold the audience with
some trite humor and an overworked
“surprise mystery ending.”

Fine Characterization

The play would have been a com-
plete loss without Alice Katz who
did a fine characterization of Mrs.
Crosby, a role occasionally smack-
ing of Imogene Coca.

Lois Rathbone as Mrs. Herge—
sheimer was fairly good, but only
because she was not in the scene
very much. Richard lioeth was stiff
and often regressed to a “brow-
clutcbing” style of method acting
gone stale. Shari Townsend did a
commendable job of making the
play somewhat palatable.

"Something Unspoken,” by Ten-
nessee Williams, is an unbelievably
had play. The author’s attempt
(characteristic of much of his work)
to find a workable character in the
neurotic fringe of faded Southern
aristocratic women fails miserably.

Gladys Winkwarth was very good
as Cornelia Scott - a woman unable
to verbalize the feelings walled up
within her.

Catherine Barker was just not
convincing as the middle—age secre-
tary, and her supposed feelings of
inexpressible anxiety and hate came
out more like an adolescent whine
and temper tantrum. Sharon House
directed well a play which is a
deadly bore.

"The Golden Axe"

“The Golden Axe,” by Ralph
Scholl, is a clever treatment of
an Ozark Mountaineer who chops
down a billboard becauseitdestroys
the view, and of his subsequent
involvement with the Widow Evans.

All three characterizations were
excellent, except for the occasional
shifts in dialect.

Eve Chambers did a magnificent
job, and Terry Fitzgerald and Robert
Dietz ran an extremely close second
with their sense oftiming and ridicu-
lous movements. Nancy Delain’s
direction tirade this play very enjoy-
able.

Eternal Triangle

In “The Stronger,” Strindberg
gives an interesting treatment to
feminism and the eternal triangle.

In a scathing indictment of the
treachery ofegocentricity in women,
he presents the thesis that the
married actress, knowing of her
husband’s affair with the unmarried
actress, is nonetheless stronger
because she can still love her frus—
band.

Mary Temple as Mrs. X was
magnificent and superb iii a role
which required constantly changing
moods and an emotional autobiog—
raphy of a distraught and frantic
Woman. Brenda Smith as the un—
married and silent actress was
excellent in a rather difficult role.

Roz Ferrara’s direction was ex-
ceptional and never let the play
Slip into drippy sentiment or didac—
tic moralizing.

Keynote Simplicity

Simplicity was the keynote of
the four productions. Most notably
poor was the lighting.

Only “The Stronger” had any
noticeable special effects, and these
for too short a time. It seems as
if the sparseness of the settings
carried over into the lightittg, with
the result that the actors were in
an unfortunate position of having
to solely create anti sustain the

moods for each play.

Disney PiCturea ‘Fantasia’

Still Great Film Treat

by Paul Jensen

Originally released in 1940, Walt

Disney’s Fantasia was very lunch
an innovation lli its attempt at visual
interpretations of music. Such things
have been dorte since. by Norman
McLaren for the National Film
Board of Canada, but these have
all been much sltorter than this
earlier feature film.
Fantasia, now re—
leased by Disney,
has held up very well
over the years. Itis,
in fact, still original
in Conception.

Deenis Taylor,
announcing each of
the wo r‘ kS,fll'St in—
troduces Leopold Stowkowski, who
conducted the Philadelphia Orches—
tra. The first selection is a Bach
toccata, a Work which makes no
attempt at telling a “story.” The
visual images, therefore, are almost
completely abstract.

 

Arrival of Winter

The Nutcracker Suite, which fol—
lows, tlcpicts elements of the arrival
of winter;in The Sorcerer's Appren-
tice Mickey Mouse attempts to rise
his triaster"s powers, but loses‘con—
trol and is nearly destroyed; Strav—
irtsky’s Rite of Spring follows the
eVolution of life on Earth through
the demise of the dinosaurs.

Beethoven’s Sixth Symphony is
given apastoral,mythological treat—

(Before CineiriaScope), some scenes
are projected through a Cinema-
Scope lens. This is fine, since the
wide screen even more completely
fills the eye with color arid pattern.

But in the non-abstract scenes
the dinosaurs, for instance. are
often horizontally elongated into ab-
surdity'.

Despite such occasrorial excesses
of plot, “cuteness” and wide screen,
every segment contains at least
some elements of beauty. Tire filrn
as a whole is successful arid enter~
raining, and the time may now he
rigltt for Mr. Disney to attempt a
sequel, using modern techniques
and processes.

stand and respect one another."
