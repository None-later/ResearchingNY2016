Sure young fellow, that Camp Dippikill is just up the road a
piece. But there isn't much there for folks like you.

Bippilrill Referendum

The question has been raised in many minds, in-
cluding ours, of whether the existence of our wilder—

ness haven at Dippikill is justified. We

is not.
The camp

believe it

is located ninety miles to the north,

within easy reach of only the few students fortunate
enough to have cars. in spite of this, large amounts
of student money have already been spent on the
camp, and plans are being made for a $50,000 lodge

to be constructed.

We feel that the expenditure of such large amounts
of money should benefit more students. We also feel
that the entire student body should make the decision,
via a referendum, on whether to keep [)ippikill or

to sell it.

We call upon Senate to initiate such a referendum,
and to inform the student body of exactly how much
student tax money is devoted to Dippikill, and exactly

how much use
rest to. the students.

line Special Bay Believes in Budget

Now that all of the special days have
been completed, one noticeable financial
trend seems to predominate. This trend
is that of violating the budget alloted
by Senate. There was only one complete
exception to this rule. This exception

is Homecoming.

Juniors Dick Stenard and Mary Lewis
in charge of the weekend. They
seem to be the only students who were
able to do enough planning to remain
with their budget. Ordinarily this would
not be considered much of an achievement,

we re

but the lack of planning by other groups
makes the planning of Stenard and In.ij
unique.

The other co-chairmen of special (lays
were not only unable to live within filliip
incomes, but they were also unable to
realize that they were exceeding ihnp.
incomes until after the debts had llt’l‘lj
created. “Good, old reliable” Senate (mm.

Earlier Examination Scheduling

We think it’s about time our big Uni—
versity went about scheduling final exams
in an intelligent manner. The ridiculous
method presently used is about as out of

date as Minerva’s spear.

Questioning students about their courses
inight have worked in the good old days.
When a University’s student population
and when the number of
courses and majors offered increases as
ours have, then it is time to change our

pushes 4000,

examination procedures.

We think it would be wise to publish
examination schedules along with the
schedule of classes. Then, as a student

laid out his schedule, he would be t‘t'Flrtrrr—
sible to see that no conflicts occurs»? in
his examinations.

In cases where conflicts were unato ‘—
able, a student could get pernria.
from his advisor to schedule tho t'trii: ,

Dr. Knolls Begins Evaluation Of Intellectual Atmosphere

Editor’s Note: The following article
begins an attempt by the S.U. News
to evaluate the “intellectual atmos-
phere” on this campus.

A series of articles, written by
faculty members and students, will
tackle this problem lit the S.U.
News from time to time.

By doing this. it is hoped some
syrithisis can be gleaned out of
the various articles, and an under-

 

standing of this campus’ “intel-
lectual atmosphere” be made pos-

sible.
to tr e t o t it

by Dr. Walter Knotts
The aim of airy university is to
foster the intellectual growth of
its students. But what a university
as in institution can do to achieve
this goal is limited.

Laundry do his bit for Campus Chest last week.

By its curriculum it can bear
witness to the importance of those
intellectual arts which quicken the
senses. stir the imagination, and
make the mind “enable and dis—
criminating. By its appointments
it can attempt to insure that this
curriculum is vividly realized in
teaching which itselfisiritellectually
distinguished.

Attitudes Most Influential

But the course of study a student
follows arrtl the kind of teachers
be iras are of less importance in
fostering his intellectual growththair
the attitudes which he meets amongst
his fellow students.

These attitudes play around him
continuously. Tlrey dcteririine the

this titiiiosplrcr'e is like. I don’t
know wlral is said o\cr coffee or
in tho dorirrilorics or on tlrc treks

from annex to annex. All I can
do is guess front what I hear in
classroom or iii conversations with
students.

Mistaken Values

From this fragmentary data, I
would suppose that the intellectual
climate at State is not very stimu-
lating. Many students. I’m afraid,
see their four years here simply
as a period in which they painfully
go through courses, adding up cred-

its like trading stamps until they
have enough to get that marketable
thing — a degree. Discussions about
course work and about books are, I
would guess. strategic rather titan
intellectual; that is, they are gener-
ated by the desire to determine
what is necessary for a good grade
rather than by the anticipatedpleas-
ure iii simply entertaining an idea.

And what is necessary for a good
grade? For many students an A,
B, or C would seem to be the
prize for a shrewd guess in a
psychological game. Obviously the
lectures of every instructor move
on some pattern and for these stu-
dents the pattern is to be found
in the somewhat obscure impulses
of the instructor’s personality. Dis-
cussions of course work become,
their, attempts to find out “what
the instructor wants.”

But even if the discussions should
revolve around the demands ofthe
