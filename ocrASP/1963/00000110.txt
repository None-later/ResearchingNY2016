llliany-tlie City mm", "s

by John Marion

Albany is in a state of transition. A hot knife
has been thrust into its cancerous guts and is in
the process of removing what has been festering there
for many years. Where there once were slums there
will soon be modern office buildings; lots once crowded
with tiny bars and soda shops now serve as parking
lots.

One must remember, however, that so-called
“slums” are not always all that the term implies.
Many buildings in slum areas do not fit the usual
image of the slum. Many are clean and reasonably
well-kept, their only fault that of being old and,
consequently, starting to slump and fall. The location
is often the only reason for the demolition of a building.

We must also remember that rundown apartment
buildings are more than slums; they are the homes of
many people and no matter how rundown a place
may be, it is the home of some people and they have
formed a certain emotional attachment to it. Con—
sideration of this fact may give some insight into
the objections of many people to urban renewal.

South Mall

A total of 85 acres in downtown Albany is now
undergoing urban renewal to make room for many
new state government buildings, known as the South
M111 project. This project serves a dual purpose; it
not only clears out many buildings that should have
been torn down years ago, but it also provides space
for many much-needed buildings to house various
departments of the state government.

Between the time of evacuation and construction
of the new buildings, however, the state of the Mall
area is unique. The vacated buildings stand like
a child’s forgotten toys; they seem to realize their
uselessness and sag under the weight of this real—
ization. The doors are boarded up, the windows are
broken and a heavy dust settles over everything.

Now they have new inhabitants. Pigeons constantly
fly in and out through the jagged window—frames, rats
scurry through the broken glass in the cellars of
a thousand lifeless dwellings. The state of much of
the South Mall area is now one of lifelessness, a
kind of death is in the air.

Never-Ending Cycle

This is the essence of the uniqueness of the tran—
sition. The people have moved to other, similar
buildings in other sections of the city, but the old
apartments stand as mute reminders of their former
inhabitants. The old corner stores, the hole-in-a-wall
bars, and the apartment buildings are the receptacles
of countless memories for the former inhabitants.

Within the next few years all these buildings will
be gone; the memories, meaningless; the cancer,
destroyed; the city, purged of its oldest elements —
the elements most repugnant to the middle—class
mores which rule our society, Clean, new, modern
offices will have replaCed the slums; the oltlest section
will now be the newest.

It will be then, when the cycle is complete, that it
can begin again and what is the newest now will
eventually become, once more, the cancer that will
have to be removed.

Film Succeeds on Gusto and Cost

by Paul Jensen

A large number of John Wayne’s
past films have been directed by
his friend, John Ford. These iii—
clude The Man Who Shot Liberty
Valance and the more recent Don-
ovan's Reef. The cast and charac-
ter of Wayne’s newest film, Mc-
Lintock, give the impression that
it is still another by Ford.

Viewer's Advantage

The picture, however, is defi-
nitely not a Ford film—and this is
all to the viewer’s advantage.

Ford, the director of sucli clas-
sics asThe Informer and The Grapes
of Wrath seems iii recent years to
have lost his touch.

About all that remains is a geri-
eralized technical polish, which
alone is insufficient to lioldtogeilier
the cliches oftlie pretentious Liberty
Valance or the amateurish inipro~
visatiorr of Donovan's Reef.

liis problems seems to lie iii
the selection, and control, of his
material.

Of course, McLintock also has
its share of cliches. Certainly the
figure of" the rich cattle baron has

Legislation passed by
Senate on November 13,
1963, requires attendance
at at least three Senate
meetings of students who
wish to run for Senate next

This applies to all stu-
dents, regardless of class.

been overused for some years now.
In addition, the filmhas subplots and
extraneous incidents that cause itto
ramble shiftlessly about for over

two hours.

But two things keep these elements
frorn falling as flat as a Ford film.
First, it is played for laughs, and
iii many cases gets them. It suc—
ceeds through sheer gusto, and the
spirit that pervades the picture is
often infectious.

There is, for example, a massive
disorganized tiieice early in the
film. with the fallen combatants
sliding smootth downhill into a
lake of mud.

It is totally confused, and the di-
rection does little to organize it.
Cutting. close-tips and the selection
of specific incidents are ofteti for-
gotten, but the force and fun iii it
keeps it enjoyable.

Excellent Cost

The second advantage is an ex-
cellent cast of character actors,
who make the liiiti succeed almost
solely on the power of their per-
sonalities.

There’s Wayne. oi course—older,
paunchier, htit still t‘orcci'ul. He
even acts a hit. giving an amusing
performance in his big drunk Scene.
This episode features some very
funny business about a flight of
stairs.

Maureen O’Hara. as his Wife, is
her ustial Irish-tempered sell and
Yyonne de Carlo is Wayne’s" newly
hired cook.

Also participating are Chili Wills,
as the ranch ranirod, Edgar Buch—
anan, inevitably plating the town
derelict, Gordon Jones as a foolish
shyster and Jerry Van Dyke as his
equalh foolish collegiate son.

Pleasure Marks Growth

And what a dream mistake it
is. It precludes. oi course. any
inkling oi the fact that intellcciual
growth is pleasurable —- that a
discussion can he exhilarating, a
poem excitinga rrnrtheniuiicalequa-

While some of the roles, such as
Van Dyke’s, are on the verge of
being overdone, the tone of the eti-
tire picture is sufficiently bread
for them not to seem out of place.

It’s the kind of filiii that a viewer
must be in the mood for, and that
needs the spontaneous laughter of a
large audience. As entertainment
it is light, and all subtlety istlirown

Depending upon the viewer, it can
be either a sporadically funny farce,
or a consistently silly slapstick
western — it’s the individual’s re-
action that counts.
