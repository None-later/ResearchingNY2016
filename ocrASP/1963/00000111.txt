Chartering Service lnelliciont

The events of last Wednesday and Sunday proved the
inefficiency of Senate as a medium for chartered
bus service. A greater share of the blame, however,
should rest on the Greyhound Bus Lines.

Their complete lack of co—ordination was demon-
strated on Wednesday afternoon when at least one
bus was re—routed immediately before departure,
and again, on Sunday evening when several buses
were hours late, or didn’t show up at all.

Many individuals felt confident that by signing up
on a Senate bus the success of the venture would
be ensured. The general faith of those students in-
volved was soon shattered. It became more than
clear by the end of Thanksgiving vacation that the
Greyhound Bus Lines was a poor business risk.

We would suggest an investigation of the entire
matter, including the issue of refunds to those stu-
dents whose buses were re—routed or whose buses
didn’t appear at all. We thank Senate for undertaking
the huge chartering plan to begin with, but think it
unfortunate that so many mishaps shouldhave occurred.

In the future, we would suggest that another bus
line be contracted for vacation chartering service.

lohn F. Kennedy, 1917-1963

He was a big, athletic man, and when
he walked on the speaker’s platform,
even in his younger days, he immediately

attracted attention.

His smile was quick and warm; his
personality overwhelming. His wit was
sharp, and his commandoffacts immense.

Most of his fellow countrymen never
met, or even saw, him personally. Yet
through our communications media, we

all got to know this man.

Enrollment Reaches All-Time High

The academic year of 1963—64
shows a record enrollment for State
Universrty at Albany and the en—
tire State University of New York.
Tin-re are 3,188 full-time students
enrolled at Albany and 70,510 in
the State University.

The above figures are all-time
highs. The introduction of year-
roiind calendars at llarpur College,
the Agricultural and Technical Iii-
stitutc at l‘hl'llllllg‘dﬂlE, and the Col-
lege at New Paltz accounts for
part of this record enrollment.

The full-time enrollment repre-
sents a 12.5% increase over last
year. There are also 46,669 slu-
deuts in part time degree credit
study and 8,725 taking non-degree—
credil courses. There are almost
132,000 students now altendingclas-
ses throughout the State University.

The \ear—roiind programs were
introduced as a methodofdetcrniiii-
lug the pirSSlliilll)’ of increasing
full—limo enrollment through iii—
cri-ascd utilizationol eliistlug facili-
ties.

For maximum success. the pro-
gram depends upon equal enlci‘iiig
classes. 'l‘ln- Unimrsily does not

iiuuing increase it] registration as

Under the new systems at Harpur
and Farmlngdale. students attend
classes for two consecutive semes-
ters and lake the third off. New
Paltz students attend for three con—
secutive quarters andtaketlie fourth
off.

Students stand to benefit by these
pilot programs for they may ac-
celerate their studiesbyyear—round
attendance and graduate earlier.

There are four new community
colleges now in operation whose
enrollments have contributed to the
total. These are Jefferson,Niagara,
Sulliiaii, and Ulster County Com-
munity Colleges.

operation become better

As of September, twenty-five of
the twenty-eight authorized coni-
munity colleges were in operation.
One sponsored by the Boards of
Supervtsors of Fulton and Montgom-
ery Counties and two by the New
York City Board ol‘Higiier Education
should be open in September, 1964.

Projections for future enrollment
indicate that the three units operat-
ing on year-round schedules will
accept approximately 375 additional
freshmen that could not have been
accommodated under the two-sein-
ester program.

As a result of the increased
enrollment, the eventual full-time
total for the year is expected to
be raised to 77,000.

Albany-the City m

by J. Marion

not Us

It is an accepted fact that educational standards
are not all they could be in Albany. There are two
public high schools — Albany High and Philip Schuy-
ler. Albany High, as you all know, is located between

Western, Washington,

and Lake Avenues.

Philip

Schuyler is at the cornerofTrinity Place and Westerlo
Street, south of Madison Avenue in the South End.

Due to the economic geography of Albany, the stu-'
dents who attend Schuyler are from generally lower
socio-economic backgrounds and for this reason the
standards are generally lower there.

Hopelessness Prevails
The generally accepted theory of schooling is that
a child attends until he hits a block, like third year
English or financial difficulties at home, then quits

to go to work.

A feeling of hopelessness towards ever improving
one’s economic status prevails among almost all, but
it is even more deeply imbedded among Negroes due
to existing discriminatory hiring practices among

employers.

Coupled with this hopelessness is the fact that the
idea of college is completely outside of their frame
of reference. it is never an idea that is‘ rejected; it is
never thought of. While this situation seems almost
hopeless, something is being done; something thatcan
involve students here at State.

At the beginning of last summer a tutorial project
was started in Albany by two members ofthe Northern
Student Movement. It is similar to dozens of other
projects in other cities across the northeast section
of this country. With the help of the Trinity institute,
rooms were obtained in churches for teaching and
college students started tutoring students from the
South End on an individual basis.

If any of you are interested in helping one child get
through high school and perhaps go to college, you
are invited to devote an hour and a half a week to this
project. To join or obtain further details, see Pro-
fessor Hayes of the Speech Department in Richardson

288.

Call this project what you will — foolish, useless,
for do—gooders — anything you like; the fact remains
that it is working, helping many students finish high
school and even go to college who never would have.

The only bitch is this — without volunteers from

this school, it will
