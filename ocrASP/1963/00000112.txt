text of the Address

It is about seventy hours since John F. Kennedy was shot. This is a
time-period that is shockingly short in which to change the whole com-
plexion of our national life. Yet it seemsa long time to us now, perhaps
because together we have run through a wide range of emotions: shock,
and anger, disbelief, fear, outrage, honest grief and misgivings for the
future.

I approach with humility and a very deep sense of my own inade-
quacy the task that your Student Association officers asked itie to as-
sume — that of reflecting in some degree the feelings of our university
membership, to express the response of our own distinctive community
to the tragic events on which I need not dwell. Wiser and much more
eloquent men than I have been heard in these past seventy hours, and
the nation has listened; in a very real sense all has been said.

That I approach at all the task of saying what I believe each one of
you would say - of speaking not to you but for you — reflects my belief
that our community is distincﬁye, that—Tin response is therefore
somehow special, signiﬁcant for us in ways that are uniquely our own.

Our community is, of course, different. and distinctive lll its re-
sponsesto these events. First. and most obviously. it is younger, at
least iii its average age. This community reacts. therefore. to the qual-
ities which characterize youth -— John Kennedy’s yigor. his flexibility,
his totigli resdience. his impatience with the conditions he considered
wrong, his desire to change things now, theurgent thrust ot his program
and of his personality.

To these, young men and women responded with warmth and a sense
of glad participation. a ready recognition of the concerns that moyed
this man, and an identification ‘.'.'ltll him in seeking to adiance those
Concerns. And when that life was snipped off. so at ruptlj. . So llll]UStl’-.
these young men and women were at once more lecpl‘. shocked more
fiercely angered. and zet more adaptable to the deep seated changes
that must result.

A SeCond charaueristtc of the tiniyersit: t'ttlllllllllll". is, or course.
its dedication t-i reason. and 'o the exercise of intelligence. To us, it
was important that John Kennedy was a tnoughtzul man. .i reader of
skill and of selectiyi'y. a Sclit'darly commentator on social history, a
cnroiiicler of courage. lle hiie‘.‘.'tliells85ttl scholarship and ot scholars;
his most trusted adyisors were academic men.

The greater is our reyulsion. therefore. from tne senseless sat-agerj.
of his assassmation. iv'. a young fanatic Willi a twelve—dollar mail-
order rifle — the apparent triumph of senselessness oyer reasttn, and
courage. and intelligence.

Third the uniyersuy tommunity is committed to goals of sen-rte.
We don’t dissect our motiyations \er'. often; nexertheless. it is tlea:

 

that the universit‘. ('tiltlllltlttlt'. is founded on the toi.'.itti~:, '.'.;l’. tnaz.

lirmation of the impossible.

In the dorms students spread
the news iroin room to room and
radios and 'l'\' wore turned on, Most
classes were canccllcd for tho day.
As the news was irrevoltaldy con-
firmed. reactions changed. Some
criod. some pray‘t-d, Stillle twin to
churches. sonic went to bars, sonic

The station came oi) the air shortly
after the aimounceiiient of the as—
sassination and kept up a steady
