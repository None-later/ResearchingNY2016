pressive 37-19 half time lead and
coasted to an easy victory.

Gutwillig sank eight from the
field for 16 points and Hickey ripped
6 shots through the nets. Browiier
and Colin also netted 4 field goals
apiece to help pace the Goober
attack.

APA Controls Boards
A well balanced APA squad easily
defeated Potter I, last year’s cham-

 

pions, by a 49-35 count. Strong
board play enabled APA to control
the game throughout. Gary Smith

with 10 and 13 points respectively.

day. Another APA team emerged
victorious as they defeated the Iii-
finites in overtime 41-35. DiCaprio

spectively. APA pulled out to a

half and the score at the end of
regulation was knotted at 35 all.
APA dominated overtime play. Di-
Caprio netted 4 points in overtime

and APA won going away.

HAMMING
IT UP

The contest slated for tomorrow night was to have
proved a point made in this column a few weeks ago.
Unfortunately the Fates have fouled things up again.
New Paltz’s star center, has withdrawn from school
this semester. It seems that dispite valiant attempts
to keep this not too academically inclined lad in
school, he has backed out for a semester. The odds
now favor Albany.

On the national basketball scene we are going to
place our heads on the block, (not that they haven’t
been there before) and pick NYU to finish no.1
in the country, with Loyola of Chicago a close second.
Please save your comments until the end of the
seas0n.

For study bugs that don’t want to make the long
trip WSUA will be broadcasting the games. We urge
all students that can’t attend the games in person
to tune in the play by play aocormt on WSUA. Remem—
ber it’s your team.

The cold weather heralds the possible appearance
of the one, the only, Lake Minerva. Yes, friends
that cancerous pond that we all love so well may
appear overnight, as if createdbyawonderfulmagician.
The new students are in store for a marvelous treat.
if we all pray real hard, the wondrous transformation
may take place on Dorm Field.

Could someone tell us how male cheerleaders are
going to inspire State fans to bigger and better cheers?
We have nothing against males waving the pom poms,
but we fail to see any gain in refusing the girls
admittance to the ‘unks of the rah rah squad. We
are certainly not an all male school as any State coed
will tell you, so let’s have EQUAL opportunity for all.

Another prediction: Albany State — 15—7, starting
with Onconta as first victim...

Fifth in Hiram Tourney

Wrestling against strong competition, the Feds placed
fifth in last Saturday’s Hiram 'l‘ournament held at
Hiram College in Ohio. The tourney, which consisted
of eight teams was won by t'nvored Ohio University.
Hiram College and Miami of Ohio took second and
third positions, respectively.

The Pods were at a disadvantage in the, tournament
since they were only able to fill eight often positions.
in spite of this, they accumulated twenty—nine points
to finish ahead of Rlll, Rochester Institute of Tech—

TEAM NOTCHES WIN IN OPENER

The New Paltz Hawks invade the Washington Ave. Armory tomorrow night
to do battle with the Feds. New Paltz has shown great improvement in recent
years and is expected to be strong. Last year the Hawks received outstanding
play from Bob Dilman and Fred Sadler. Dilman has graduated but Sadler was
only a freshman. Big Fred was the team’s leading scorer and rebounder.
ew Platz has picked up several transfers, but they are

unconfirmed.

Albany will be going with two veteran starters, Dick Crossett and Joe Loudis.
The shifty Crossett gave the normal schoolers fits last year. It will probably
be his job to contain Sadler. Both teams will have had one game behind them
when they lock horns at the Armory. The odds-makers are predicting a close,
tough game with the outcome depending on the foul-line.
