L. R .
'Spuin’ Explores Her Inner Soul

by J. A. Gomez

Nikos Kazontzakis, SPAIN (New
York, I963), Simon and Schuster,
254 pages — $5.00.

Like D. H. Lawrence, Nikos Kaz-
antzakis was a frenzied prophet who
preached a Dionysian vision of life.
Like Lawrence, he was a world
traveler who sought some unobtain-
able ideal synthesis.

Both writers met with failure
in their quest, but botlt writers
produced penetrating “travel
books” about the many lands that
they visited.

Spain by Nikos Kazantzakis is
not a “travel book” in the ordinary
sense of the word. The reader sees
little of the peaceful Spanish court-
tryside and the everyday life of
the people, but he feels the depths
of a people’s soul.

Kazantzakls’ portrait of Spaitt is
,tinted by a mytho—historical, color-
ful, and visionary explosion ofemo-
tion and philosophy. Out of this
unique vision rides the undyingheart
of Spanish life — Don Quixote.

“The world has emerged frotn
God’s hands, rife with injustice
arid shortcomings. And he, the Knight
of the Ideal, was duty-bound to set
it right. For Don Quixote’s work
begins where God’s leaves off.”

Don Quixote
Spain. like the idealistic hero
of La Manclta, set out on art adven-
turous dream. Tlte Spanish cott-
quistador desired to brirtg Chris-
Itianity and Spanish ruleto the world.

In these troublesome times it
takes some doing to keep one’s
perspective to appraise world
conditions with intelligence
and to come up with satisfying
answers. This book, Science atttl
Health with Key to the Scrip-
tures by Mary Baker Eddy, has
helped many of Us to do this. It
can help you, too.
We invite you to come to our

In 1588, the reality of the English
navy punctured this Don Quixotesque
dream, and, like her hero, Spain
returned to her homeland to await
her last joust with death.
Kazantzakis claims that, along
with Ulysses, Faust, and Hamlet,
Don Quixote is deeply rooted in
the hearts of men. "For perhaps

of all the princes, Don Quixote
most faithfully tnlrrors the fate
of man.”

Don Miguel Unamuno

The modern representative ofDon
Quixote is Don Miguel Unatnuuo.
Like the idealistic ltero, Unatnuuo's
thoughts and plans for action are
hidden in the misty clouds of a
dreanL

Most thinkers claimed that twen-
tieth century Spain should be Eur-
opeanized; others felt that she should
remain within her own borders arid
tradition. Unauruno attemptedtoheal
the wounded heart of Spain; he
desired to Spatrify Europe.

“We are Africans. We are not
sarcastic wits arid mathematicians,
like the Europeans. We are not
scientists. We use the things dis-
Covered by them: electricity, the
railway, the telephone, etc.

"But our spirit is different: we
are mystical and tragic. Our itt-
ability to adapt ourselves to Eur-
opean culture will give us the
strength to create a new culture
of our own."

Despair

In his last years, this defeated
Spaniard was also forced to return
to his homeland, his own inner being,
and await death.

His only constant companion was
despair. In one of his last Works,
Saint Emmanuel the Good, Martyr,
he tells the story of a Catholic
priest who attempts to give the
people a faith lll which he himself
cannot believe.

legend is Don Juan. Kazantzakis’
portrayal of Don Juan, like that
of Albert Camus in The Myth of
Sisyphus, presents a man who is
not in quest of the Ideal Love.

He loves each woman with the
sattte passion and delight, and he
knows that ltls love is merely
momentary. “He possesses; he is
not possessed - and that is his
power.”

To Kazantzakls, Don Juan rep-
resents the Spirit, “the wakeful
wandering flame,” which leaps tip
and escapes the clutches of woman
- Matter.

Don Juan and Don Quixote,passion
and idealism, fortn the roots of the
Spanish people, and Kazantzakis at—
tetnpts to translate his mythical
vision of these people to the un-
familiar reader.

His verbal portraits are often as
colorful, grotesque, anti symboli-
cally personal as the Visual por-
traits of El Greco. “l-le (El Gi'eco)
succeeded, by his litre and color,
lrr crystallizittg an eterrtal phantom:
the indestructible despairing soul
of titan.”

Kazantzakis attempts a similar
purpose. At times, he is quite suc-
cessful.

Many thanks to Mr. Robert Bell,
manager of the CO-OP, who gra-
ciously supplied this book for review
purposes.

Manic Review

 

 

Ilte CIRINEBIIGE

by Elizabeth Stroud

Some evening, probably in the very near future,
(if it hasn’t already taken place) the usual emptiness
of winter-time dorm field will give way to complete
havoc; the usually crowded study lounges will concede
to the all—important first snowfall.

Provided, of course, that the snow’s good packing,
and that there is enough to pack, this very common
occurrence can offer one of the happiest times here
at State. There’s no formal organization, no pressure
(except an occasional being dragged outside physi-

cally) to

join in; no nothin’, ’cept a heap of fun.

Pressures build up, and suddenly it hits you right
between the eyes, and you don’t care how childishly
you act — so you pick up a snowball twice as big, and

hit back!

The grade-school excitement of building

forts, staging attacks, and running desperately from
the enemy, is suddenly rekindled; the crazy mixture
of thrilled annoyance that comes with snow down your
back, returns in all its glory.

Maybe it’s the unaccustomed vacation from the way
“an adult” in college should act; maybe it’s the ob—
vious exhilaration of the frosty cold; maybe it’s the
secret grin because he (or she) is aiming more snow
your direction than anyone else’s; whatever your own
special reason, the dorm field fracas is thoroughly

enjoyable.
Don’t forget:

sew your coat buttons on securely,

avoid long, winding scarves, and dress warme (the
medical office has limited gallons of Cepacol), but

for heaven’s sake, join in!

One ofthese days, there’s

going to be a real hum-dinger of a battle — I hope

you’ll take advantage of it!

'Auleur’ Theory Gains Popularity

by Paul Jensen

The latest vogue ttt motion—pic-
tur'e criticism is the so-called au—
teur theory. Formulated lll France,
it has now spread, by way of ling-
land, into the Ullllt'tl States.

It supposedly originated in the
pages of the magazine (“anti-rs drt
(.‘mema. durittg the pertod lit the
fifties when new-wave dtr'ettors.
such as l‘d‘tilit'ttls 'l‘ruffuut, were
meron critics.

It is based on the idea that the
bust flint-makers are those (mainly
intlt'opcuns) who both write and dr-
r'cct their films. and so return a
great deal of control.

As the books of an author can bc

Hearing Today on Student Tux For
Second Semester; Buses Chartered

by Steve Curti

Last Wednesday’s Senate meet-
ing was highlighted by the intro—
duction of bills proposing a second
semester student tax and the grant-
ing of permission to cltarfer va-
cation buses at Christmas time to
eight groups.

A hearing will be held this after—
noon at 1:25. The meeting place
will be posted on the Senate bulle-
tin board in llusted near thellusted-
Richardson peristyle.

Hearing Topics

Tire hearing will be used to dis—
cuss the proposed secoud semester
student tax. The various uses of the
money collected from the proposed
tax will be explained.

Some of the proposed uses for
the tax money iii the order of the
amount of proposed expenditures
are Music Council, State Univer-
srty' News, an addition to the cort-
tittgettcy' futtd, a United Press In-
ternational news seryrce for WSUA,
and the student directory.

Music Council tropes to bring
four name groups to the catttpus
next year. If given the money next
serrrester. Mustc Council, by work-
mg with other area colleges and by
srgrrmg its contracts early, could
bring excellent groups and perhaps
arrange for more than one perfor—
tttancc.

The proposer] funds for the di-
rectory would allow thc publication
of a second semester supplement
to the directory.

The funds ullottcdto the State Uni-
versity News yvouhlpermn thepaper
to publish for the whole of the sec—
ond semester. Without these funds
the paper yvrll only be able to pub~
fish for eight weeks.

The funds will .tlso allow the
paper to publish two issues :r week
for the final tttontlt of the academic
year.

President Cerra announced the
recent resignation of Carl Cusato
’66 and the longstanding resigna—
tion of Helen Mandeville ’64. Cerra
appointed Vic Mitchell ’66 and Bob
Sargeant ’64 to fill the vacancies.
The Senators were sworn itt im-
mediately.

Constitution

During the committeereports, the
State University Revue constitution
was brought up for approval. A con-
troversy arose about the reqtrire—
ttteut that Senate approve the ap—
poitttrrrerrt of the director of the
Revue.

Some Senators complained that
the constitution was poorly Worried,
and that Senate should not have the
final power of approval itttlte choice
of director.

Senator Guddat ’66 also pointed

out the fact that the proposed corr-

 

stltution states that the busmess
manager of the Revue was to be a
member of Finance Committee or
appointed by the group.

He noted that the authors of the
constitution did not present this
part of constitution to either the
Finance Cotntnittee as a whole or
to its chairman, Barbara Townsend
’65.

The Revue Constitution was sent
back to Ed Wolner’s Constitutions
Committee by a vote of Senate.

Irregularities by Choir

Tire meeting was highlighted by
several partisan comments by Cer-
ra. He tnade comments ittdicatittg
his approval of several opinions
expressed by Senators.

Senator Gain ’64 left the Senate
meeting due to these comments anti
due to the President’s refusal to
ansWer a question. Galu appealed
from the declsiott of the chair.
