Enshrine His Ideals

We are greatly distrubed about the fast-
developing mania to enshrine the late Pres—
[5‘ ident John F. Kennedy’s memory in the
building of monuments and the renaming
of public properties in his honor.

We feel that he was dynamic, vibrant,
and vital to our age, and that it is right

Busﬁs

"‘ that his memory be preserved. However,

we feel that energies to this end are being
. misdirected to projects which do not em—
body his ideals.

President Kennedy built his own monu-
’ ments to himself through pioneering and
creating such projects as the Peace Corps.
His memory will be perpetually alive as
the men and women of the United States

A Good innovation

We applaud the introduction of an all-male cheer-
leading squad to State University. Instances of marked
innovations are few and far between at State, and when- Of
ever we see something really different tried we are

pleased.

Female cheerleading has been a dismal failure at
State for the last few years. Athletic Board decided to
try a completely new approach to the problem this year
with male cheerleaders. Subsequent plans call for the

addition of women to the squad.

We like this approach. A firm male nucleus has been
formed to which State’s co—eds can be added at a later

date.

So far the male cheerleaders have done a fine job in
whipping up crowd support at basketball games. These
men have taken the job in the face of much criticism

by small-minded upperclassmen.

Male cheerleaders are accepted facts at other uni—
versities. We hope that the student body will come to
support them here. There is a very definite need for

them.

I had
But the rights of the individual are
being infringed upon.... This kind of
tripe has been heard at recent Senate
meetings. Another example of the stupid
thought current on this campus is that

“why should Senate control buses?”
It is time that the narrow minded neo-
Neanderthals of this campus woke to the
fact that transportation monopolies are
the rule and not the exception. Senate
in controlling all buses is moving in the
right direction.

If all buses were chartered by the same
group working with one or two companies,
a tremendous number of students would
receive relatively inexpensive bus rides
home.

At Thanksgiving, the first Senate spon—
sored buses hit the highways. Some of
the buses arranged for by Services Com—
mittee ran into difficulties. All ofthe major
difficulties were involved in routes to the
south of Albany. Strong action is being
taken by responsible people in Senate and

Athletic Board NearlvPowerless

We do not like the present set-up of
Athletic Advisory Board. The Board’s one
faculty and seven student members have
very little to say about athletics at State.

In the all—important matters of inter—
collegiate policy and finances the Board
is empowered only to make recommenda—
tions to President (foilins. The President
has the power to turn dow. anything the
Board submits.

A small breakthrough was made last
Week when the President gave Athletic:
Board virtual autonomy in matters of ill—
tracollcglate policy. This is a good start
but it does not go far enough,

Intracollegiate policy making really isn’t
that important in the scheme of athletics
here at State. If and when the sports pro—
gram is to gain decent proportions, the real
battles and issues will be found in inter~
collegiate policy and the yearly budgets.

We would like to see some fresh view—
points in these areas. We think that student
members of Athletic Board could do a
