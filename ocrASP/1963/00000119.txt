Three Perfect Picks
[in Mill All-Stars

After a highly successful football
season, the captains of the teams
selected the following players as
Ail-Stars. A special note should be
made of the players who were un-
animously selected by the opposing
captains. Mike Camarata, Dick Odo-
rizzi, and Steve Zahurack received
20 out of 20 possible votes. Jack
Buchalter was elected to both the
first teams, certainly an outstand-
ing achievement. The teams selected
were as follows:

The Goober’s won impressively
for the second straight week, de-
feating Potter by a 44-32 count.

HAMMING
IT UP

Coach Sauers will be wearing green ties in the
near future. Why? He is becoming more fond of the
Irish each day. A lad by the name of O’Donovan is
the key factor in the big change. Jumping Jim, a gift
from Broome Tech, has made like a janitor of the
boards. Gathering in anything that bounces off the
rim he has a two game total of 30 rebound.

He hasn’t missed a foul shot yet and we certainly
hope he doesn’t for the rest of the season. O’Dee is
quite a break for the Peds.

What’s this, a new offense? Under fire from sev—
eral people as being a conservative in the Dangerous
“Dan” category, Coach S. has rallied with a new
Varsity shuffle. Congratulations on this new addition,
and may it cause many victories.

The Armory was filled almost to capacity, last
Saturday night. Some people aren’t sure if the
crowds were there to cheer for State or curiosity
seekers. Perhaps somewhere in the huge crowd
was the god like being that judges the masculinity
of others.

If we’re real lucky he mightpublish anotherlibelous
edition. Some people pick very poor ways to fight an
idea they don’t like.

A footnote on the New Paltz game has been added
by their coach. In a short interview he said that he
would have five transfers eligible next semester. He
had hopes for the return of Fred Sadler, but was not
too optimistic on this score.

Anyone that has not seen an AMTA fourth league
basketball game cannot say that he has seen every—
thing. To try to describe one is a near impossibility,
but we are going to make a feeble attempt. It is a
terrible combination of tackle football, soccer, and
volleyball. The referees are amazing. They make
good calls at the wrong time and bad calls most of
the time. The Globetrotters could learn a few new
routines from these guys.

Wrestling Team Ramps
Beats Brooklyn Poly 27-5

Winning every match against an incxporicnccdBrook—
lyn Poly team, the Pods recorded their first victory of
the season 27—5. The lost pointswcrcduc to an inability
to fill one weight class. The contest which was held in
a Brooklyn YMCA gm, featured four pins by Pod
wrestlers.

These pins were by Bill Thomas (12%) over Mike
Siegal in 3:34, Bob Yerrigeni (137) over Steve Altman
in 5:38 and Larry Thomas (167) over Richard lx’ubcck
in 1:58. Ron Smith, who will be eligible next semester,
showed good prospects as be pinned Jerry Lietman in
1:18. Since Ron was ineligible, five points were lost.

John Bennett, John Robb, Richard Robellotto and
Gene Monaco each defeated their opponents by do—
cisions. Because of the inexperience of Poly’s wrest—
lers the Feds were easily able to take the match. This
was Poly’s second defeat of the season.

Frosh Open Season Saturday

This Saturday, both the frosh and varsity squads will
be traveling to Farleigh Dickinson for a match. This
