Critic Feels Huston Follows Auteur Policy

by Paul Jensen

John Huston is a director who
has arbitrarily been labeled “non-
auteur.”

It seems strange that directors
such as John Ford, who constantly
depend on screen-
plays by many dif—
ferent people, are
classed as the auth—
ors of their films,
while the “fallen
idol” Huston, who
began his career as
a script writer and
almost always at least collaborates
on this aspect of his films, 1

 

quickly dismissed from considera-
tion.

Despite the auteur "critics" de-
termined efforts to rationalize them
away, Huston has made at least four
particularly excellent films, and one
which is definitely a classic.

First Flick Clicks

His first picture. The Maltese
Falcon, turned out to be one of the
best mysteries every filmed. This
is due as much to the direction,
surprisingly accomplished for abe-
ginner, and the script as to the
cast and quality of the original
Dashiell Hammett novel.

The auteur “critics” will con—

The cininulilii

by Elizabeth Strand
Is this year so much more difficult than years past?
For some reason, people seem to be “underthe weath-
er” more than usual. Beneath the meaningless response
of “I’m fine,” you can’t help noticing a pretty wide-

spread lack of being fine.

Maybe it’s just getting toward the end of the semes—
ter, but I doubt it; this discouragement has been present

for some time.

People who are normally happy are

walking around brooding; bright students are discussing
the possibility of leaving school.

State has always been filled with academic pressures
if not equal to those of other schools, then frequently
greater. This year, it’s really outdoing itself. If this
is a conscious effort, a planned movement in“cracking

down,”

then perhaps there’s an explanation — some

logical excuse. If this isn’t the case, thenthere’s cause

for real worry.

I’m not talking about any lack of “rah—rah-Statc—is
great” enthusiasm, and I hope no one has misunder—

stood me. There is,

however,

a depressive apathy

which can be remedied only by individual re—evalua—

tion and effort.

Maybe I’m making a big thing out of nothing — I wish

I could believe that.

In any event, there’s not much

one person can do to combat the loss of spiritand
drive that is hobbling such a surprising number of

students.

Perhaps with vacation approaching, some

time can finally be allotted to serious thought about

this problem.

I sincerely hope that,

instead of in—

creasing participation in what could become a deadly

downward spiral of morale,

a rational, more opti-

mistic attitude and answer can be found. The potential
for a reversal in the present state of things exists.
Let’s stop this insidious leak before it gets way out of

hand.

cede that it is a good film, but they
refuse to admit that Huston had
anything to contribute. The success
of the picture, they say, is due totlie
good fortune that the cast (Humph-
rey Bogart, Mary Astor, Sidney
Greenstreet, Peter Lorre) was ide-
ally suited to the characters.

The Big Sleep, from a Raymond
Chandler novel, is the same type
of tough, private-eye film, with
many of the same players. Its main
distinction is a script that gets the
viewer completely confused, and
never resolves the plot.

The audience is no closer to a
solution at the end than at any
point during the picture.

It is, however, directed by an
auteur, Howard Hawks, and so is
naturally a better film than that of
Huston. The rationalization: its
inconclusiveness makes it moretrue
to life.

Taking the two films alone, to
stand or fall on their own individual
merits, Without regard for the rest
of the director’s career, it is ob—
vious that Falcon is by far a better
film.

Other Films

The Battle of San Pietro, a docil-
iiientary edited by Huston from
World War II combat footage, is
considered one of the most effective
anti—war films yet made.

The Asphalt Jungle (1950) is an-
other mystcry film, this time of the
“perfect crime” school. llus‘toii’s
adaptation of The Red Badge of
Courage is his fourth line film,
also made in 1050.

But the oiicunquestionableclassic
ol llustoii’s (or anyoiic’s) career,
is The Treasure of Sierra Madre,
which he filmcd in Mexico, Willi
his lather, Wullcr Ilusloii. Humphrey

(Trevor Howard, Errol Flynn, Or—

line (one man’s attempts to save

fascinating entertainment.

These more recent films set the
auteur “policy” on Huston, and the
only problem was to force the ex-
ceptional exceptions into the party
line mold. It seems as thouin these
"critics" have convinced them-
selves that they have succeeded.

It would, however, have been just
as easy to take his good films as a
basis, and rationalize the weaker
ones onto the same level. Either
way is fruitless, pointless,and sure-
ly as uncritical as one could get.

The family cooks over

Graciela’s father is a carpenter

The money which is left provides

his own family. Her sister Socorro,
