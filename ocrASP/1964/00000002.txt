STATE UNIVERSITY NEWS. FRIDAY. JANUARY 10. 1964

Needed: tine University President

Since the announcement that tuition
would be charged at all units of the State
University and used to pay for the build-
ings in the construction programs, the
State University system has been with-

out a president.

There have been people who have said
that there is a direct causal relationship

between the two items.

STATE UNIVERSITY NEWS. FRIDAY. JANUARY 10. 1964

Pﬁnereadline
Nears; Student
Contributors Slow

Towards the end of last year,
there was a great amount of talk
about the “improved look" of the
1963 Primer. It was felt that the
future issues of the magazine should
maintain a similar high level of
.literary expression and artistic for-
tnat.

This statement does not mean
that future issues should he mere
imitations of the 1963 Primer. Each
issue tnust have its own distinctive
flavor and nuances.

As editor of Primer, I feel that
I work in a friendly atmosphere.
Primer's budget was increased over
the 1963 budget, and planshave been
made for an increase in the number
of copies to be published.

Various members of the faculty
have given needed advice and as—
sistance. The literary staff of the
magazine is booth cooperative and
capable. Yet the 1964 Primer may
not reach even the lowest of ex—
pecitiiions.

Primer is not the editor, the
Stall. or the printer. The itiost vital
element oi Primer is you. You,
the students oi this college, are re-
sponsihle l(il' all the material sub-
mitted to the literary magaztne.

You are responsible for the size,
scope and content of the 1004
Primer.

Former Speech and Drama Head
Records Background Readings

Four years ago, in 1959, one of
State’s most honored teachers of
dramatic arts retired after 42 years
of service. Far from withdrawing
frotn the profession, she is now re-
cording poetry readings in English
literature.

Miss Agnes E. Futterer, who is
presently attending Dr. Knett’sEng-
lisii class from her home on Willett
Street, was the founder oftheDrama
and Speech Department as we know
it.

Having started courses in play
produuion at a time when this
‘wasn’t done,’ she had to take upon
herself the formidable task ofteach-
trig all classes lti speecit, English
drama, and oral interpretation.

UNDERGRADS, CLIP AND SAVE

One of her most notable achieve-
ments at State was the founding of
the Dramatic and Arts Council which
aroused interest by bringing to the
school such leading dramatists as
the Abbey Players of Ireland.

A natural outbreak of her en-
thusiasm was the Theatre Arts As-
sociation which was formed by
graduate students who did not wish
to see her work disappear after her
retirement. The 'I‘AA consists of
people living in the area and meets
every two weeks on campus.

Tire small yearly membership fee
is creating a fund which will be used
to hire outstanding professors of
speech and drama from leading uni-
versities to an Agnes E. Futterer
chair. Over half of the $10,000 goal
for 1965 has been collected. Part
of the fund has come from class
donations.

Reclted Plays

Her first recording was made
after her retirement from active
teaching. She had been making ap-
pearances at schools and clubs
throughout the Eastern seaboard,
giving renditions of 28 poems and
plays, reciting complete one-act
plays by heart.

All 100 copies of her first at-
tempt, scenes front Pygmollon, were
quickly sold. Her latest recordings
are poetry readings which illustrate
the foriii of poetry and the sweep of
verse from Shakespeare to Ogden
Nash.

The records, which came out in
June. 1903, have now repaid their
cost of production and have cleared
a proiit of $500. Her third project
is a cutting of 05cm Wilde’s Lady
Windemere's Fan, heriavoriieplay.
The record should appear after
Christtiias.

Noted Students

While at the University, she spe-
cialized tti experimental play forms
and believes that every age should
experiment in drama. Her opinion
of modern drama is that it is “hard
til-'utiderstanil.“
