‘4‘» [fancy Age-{uni

fdr this year’s Dubious Distinction Award, given in appreciation to those
who best succeed in maintaining those lofty ideals of cultural and intel-
lectual mediocrity for Which our campus is iustly famous.

The nominees are
l. The “ASP” editorial staff,

for championing the cause of medio-

crity (under the guise of‘moderation) in their brilliant appraisal of the
 and A and WA. “Charlie’s Aunt, anyone?

2. WSUA, for taking the “ASP’S” comments to heart. How about
student’s who pay good tax money for better music? ' a

. *3. The “Council of Economic Advisers" for their strict adherence

ally-oriented people can find a cheap substitute for Carlos Montoya.
We’d rather hear John Lennon, anyway?

4. The student body, who in their concern for our intellectual at-
mosphere, cannot see the stumbling vacuity walking — no, running in the
back door, while they stand by just watching (Co-nominees with our il-
ﬁistrious administration for the “Passivity Award.”)

5.-The administration for fostering this student-run anarchy of

which we are so proud.

School Boom

Building Design Reflects Change

There are 1,200,000 classrooms
in the United States — but before
this decade is over, we will need
an additional 1,600,000. This year
alone, the school construction bill
in this country will be $3 billion.

The big question is: Are Amer-
icans getting the best schools for
their money?

Before this question can he ans-
wered, we should have some idea
of what makes a good school.

William W. Caudill, a prominent
school architect, says a good school
is an efficient caching machine. If
a good school couldtalk,Mr. Caudill
says, this is what it would say:

"I have a job to do. I do it Well.
I stimulate learning, not deter it. I
facilitate effective and cititdent ed-
ucation. I am more than a dead
structural casing. I am dynamic.1
work the students. Iprovide apieas-
ant, inspiring environment for
study.”

The idea of the cellular school -—
individual classrooms in which stu—
dents are taught "lost of their sub-
jects by one teacher ~ has been
losing ground for some time.

The trend is toward team teach-
ing in large areas which can be

partitioned by movable interior
walls. Children of different grades
can receive their own levels of
instruction, but when a lecture or
motion picture which is appropriate
to all is needed, the teacher must
only push a button to roll the wall
hack.

Larger rooms mean fewer ox-
terior walls. This offers the oppor—
tunity for more efficient construc-
tion and equipping. A natural ven-
tilation system allows air move-
ments within the interior of the
building to’ exceed the spocd of
outside breezes without the use of
blowers.

Butldings can also be designed
to reverse the air flow, thus in-
suring circulation of fresh air to
all parts of the school. With lil-
creasing emphasis on college pro-
grams, high school officials are
finding a greater need for larger
lecture halls, seminar rooms and
independent study areas. In addi—
tion, space is needed for more
audi-vlsuat aides, language and sci-
entific labs and own teaching ma-
chines.

The best designed new schools
combine beauty and economy with

the balance of structural mass,
clean lines and proper proportions
of steel, glass and stone.

To offset the impersonal egg-
crate feeling that modern building
materials can sometimes give to a
building, school architectsarousing
more and more natural stone. Stone
not only enhances a structure but
also gives it strength and means

substantial savings in maintenance
Costs.
School construction costs have

given community officials some of
their biggest headaches. Since 1934,
the cost of building schools has
gone up 150 percent. Probably the
main reason for the smaller rise
in school costs is that politicians
often prefer cheaper constructitm
hills in order to make it appear
that they are saving the taxpayers’
money.

To keep contracts low, school
boards sometimes authorize the use
of poor grades of cement asphalt,
cheaper locks on doors anti 10-
year root’s instead of zomyea. bonded
roofs, of one-coat paint Jobs.

In the long run, poorly designed,
cheaply constructed schools cost
more than if they were butltproper—
ly. Bargain fixtures need frequent
replacing and sectional outside walls
are likely to leak.

What can taxpayers do to see that
they get good value for their school
construction dollars?

It takes more than just a passing
interest in local affairs. Civiciead-
ers urge frequent attendance at
municipal and school board meet-
ings, Only then will officials and
the public begin to realize the prac-
tical, educational and cultural ad-
vantages of constructing a school
of lasting strength and beauty.

The current exhibit in the Draper
Gallery will close today with a lec-
ture by the artist. Norman Daly, a
professor of art at Cornell, will
speak in D349 at 1:25 p.m. His
topic, a fitting one considering his
style, will be “Form in Poetry.”

One of Professor Daly’s prime
concerns in painting is this form
of which he shall speak. His works
convey the lesson that form is in-
herent in the art object.

Each abutting form is carefully
considered in its relationship to
every other. Each twist of visual
direction is deliberatly premedi-
tated. All are united within the rec-
tangle of the two-dimensional sur-
face, the integrity of which Profes-
sor Daly is anxious to protect.

Resiralned Instrumentation

No modeling takes place within
the confines of its edges. His in-
tent upon form is heightened by the
very way in which this surface is
used. His paintings simulate a quiet-
ly symphonic tone poem. These ex-
ercises in restrained instrumenta-
tion accent the essentially sombre
implications of these creations.

A strong contribution to his theme
is also made by the skill with which
the artist ages his surfaces. His
veneers of pale color and thinly-
applied glazes appear to be a pro—
duct of the antiquity of which he
speaks.

Two small, faded, wooden “San-
tos” or Southwestern Indian sacred
representations, hung by leather
thongs, which appear incalcuiably
old, are excellent examples of this
technique at its peak. A second as-
pect of this age is the use of
strongly Byzantine angularity in the
“Archangel Tobias.” He is in all
his paintings a master at implying
age through the smooth, Worn-thin
surface.

A rewarding aspect of the show,
though only a minor one, is Pro-
fessor Daly’s refusal to attribute
a specific meaning to these pic-
tures.To accent their essential sig-
nificance he has used an abstract
nomenclature, e.g. “Ancient Sym-
bol #20.”

It is difficult to assess Profes-
sor Daly’s work one painting at a
time. Each impinges 'dlrectly upon
the others. We cannot but divide
them into symbolic types.

3 Maior Types
The first type intends to create

   

Show Stresses Integrity circuit

a surface in which small forms
move in an endless, but controlled
activity. The essentially pagan char-
acter of this motion is captured in
“Ancient Symbol #6.” In these
works, the use of the surface is
arrived at through planning in pro-
cess.

A second type is primarily con-
cerned with the development of a
pre-planned form — a simplifica-
tion of the human figure in ancient
dress. Professor Daly searches for
a symbol equally applicable to all
religious concepts, those of the
prophet, the priest and the oracle.
It can be viewed as an Eastern
prophet or as the Holy Trinity (as
in “Early Christian Symbols #3).

A third minor fascination in paint-
ing is that of pure abstraction.
“Composition in Black withObject"
and “Tripartite Arrangement” are

‘R aft’ Overcomes Symbols

by Bruce Daniels

Last Friday night's highly imag-
inative and polished performance
kept George Kaiser’s “Raft of the
Medusa” from sinking under the
weight of its own grandiose “sym-
bolism.”

An inveterate, prolific writer of
“denkspielen” (or“thought-p1ays")
Kaiser attempted no less than a
re-enactment ofthe Christian drama
and an examination of the sources of
Evil. To do so, the author relied
heavily on traditional Christian and
psychoanalytic symbols.

But for symbols to “work” they
must first have a concrete, literal
reality of their own. Kaiser’s“sym-
bols” have little or none. Alan is
Christ simply because the author
says he is.

Wartime Tale

Apparently inspired by a wartime
news item, Kaiser took this spare
little story of thirteen childrenadrift
for a week after their ship had been
sunk (and of whom only eleven sur-
vived) and tried to make of it a
parable of Western Man.

What happens in the tiny, con—
stricted world of the lifeboat is
reminiscent of Dostoevsky’s Grand
Inquisiter tale.

Christ (Alan) returns to confront
the most eloquent spokesman (Ann)
for a Christianity that has longheen
divorced front God, that worships
instead the meaningless fetish of
numbers and thrives on ignorance
and superstition.

first and third plays will he directed by Dr. J. Burian
0f the State University, the middle play by Mr. C. D.
Smith, III, visiting Professor from Alfred University.
Among" the plays undor ocmsidc 'tilfloil for this summer

the representations of this mode.

They are as thoroughly and thought-
fully plotted as the Symbols and
carry through into non-objectivity
the skill in manipulating tone and
form. Three dimensional effects are
blatant, not suggested, e.g. “The
Object."

included in the show are several
pieces of “found object" sculpture.
In them, Professor Daly strives to
imitate by use of the rusted object
and the familiar, foreboding shape.
The effect, however, is not frighten-
ing as much as it is whimsical.

In summary, let us say that Pro-
fessor Daly’s abstract statement
represents a 20th-century piety.
His exhibit is a lesson in the uni-
versality of religious symbolism
for all time,

fear of the number 13, Alan sym-
bolically “crucifies” himself -
presumably taking the sins of his
weaker brethren on himself.

The bother with this is that as
soon as Little Fox is thrown over-
board, a rescue plane arrives and
the children are saved. It looks as
if Ann had really been right in in-
sisting that all their trouble was
a matter of numbers.

Moments Shine Out

If the play is less than satisfac- .

tory as a whole, there are certain
isolated moments that exercise a
strange and fascinating power. The
sudden transition from playful chat-
tering to the elevated seriousness
of the mock-wedding on the Sixth
Day is both pathetically funny and
terribly foreboding.

Alan lying dead across the gun-
wales at the end of the play “as if
crucified” is a brief and chilling
visual metaphor of spiritual deso-
lation. The world has left him to
die without understanding or even
knowing of his final gesture ofLove.

Expressionist

The combination of unusual or
striking dramatic images with a
somewhat less-than-coherent over-
all theme seems characteristic of
the Expressionist school in gen-
eral.

Kaiser, the patron saint of the
Expressionists, has embodied both
the virtues and the vices of this
interesting and influential move-
ment.

In any case, Friday night’s per-
formance marked a triumph of
translation over the original mater-
ial. Tasteful direction, technical
imagination and well-paced, sensi-
‘tive acting combined in a collective
effort to make us forget the weak-
nesses of the script.

Visually Effective

The photo montage opening the
play, the vaguely unsettling medley
of children’s songs, the drum-beats,
the lighting -- all helped relieve
what would have been an unbearable
tension, besides being interesting
in themselves.

This year’s final lllﬂjtll‘ dramatic
production was a delight to eye,
ear and emotion — it'notctmslstent-
ly to the mind.

The fact that psychological drama
can be handled in many ways was
evidenced by the three very differ-
ent treatments of theatrical expres-
sion in the A. D. plays presented
last week.

The first play, Henri Duvernois’
“The Bronze Lady and the Crystal
Gentleman” is a farcical story about
a henpecked husband who feigns
madness to escape from his shrew-
ish wife. Harry Guy’s characteriza-
tion of Sourcier, the husband, was
clever and funny, but it lacked var-
iation of mood and feeling.

Valerie Golom's spirited portray-
al of Madame Sourcier was excel-
lent. Roberta ’l‘renkner’s direction
was noteworthy, if only for the fact
that the play itself offered little to
work with.

Much Phlloaophy, Little Plot

“Brewsie and Willie” is a sad
Gertrude Stein attempt to express
too much philosophy in too little
time. The play is virtually plotless,
and is essentially a character study
of a group of American soldiers in
France at the close of the second
World War.

Bruce Daniels was a convincing
Brewsie, but an almost more con-
vincing Gary. Cooper. Jon Barden
was dynamic and superb as his
friend Willie. The very talented
Milt Cavendish Trio supplied the
introductory and closing music. Lil-
lian Schmidt’s direction was excel-

lent. . .
The evening was brought to a:

dramatically intense close with the.
presentation of John Vlele’s “The
East Room." This morbid drama
involves the interaction between the
two servants of a recently deceased
man.
Servants Dominate

John Langton and Terry Fitzger-
ald gave very fine performances as
the auctioneer’s assistants, but the
play was dominated by Lee Liss and
James Lobdell, as the two servants.
Their characterizations, intense
concentration, and remarkable stage.
presence were truly magnificent.
Gloria Avner’s direction was am-
bitious and daring, and quite good.

The exceptional lighting for the
last play almost made up for the
lack of it in the other plays  but
not quite. The settings were imag-
.inative and well-coordinated, and
the costumes were, for the most
part, creative and colorful.
