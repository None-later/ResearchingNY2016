Easily defeating New
Haven. ,8-1, in a‘ home
match last Saturday, the
varsity tennis team upped
its season won-lost record
to 9-1.

Every man on the team won his

  

singles match‘rather easily; none
of the matches needed a third set.
The doubles also were dominated
by State, with ehe exception of
Enser-Costello’s loss. Enser-Cos-
tello dropped their contest 5-7,

New Haven had a 4-3 record
going into Saturday’s match but

Uﬁca’s Pitoli'ltg Styni'os Statosm

Mozarulli fakes

State was handcuffed by
the two hit chucking of
Fran De Joseph and lost
to the Utica College 3-0
in a home game Saturday.
Tight pitching and clutch
defense dominated the well
played game.

Both teams missed golden scoring

[opportunities in the first inning.
The Pioneers loaded the bases with-
out the benefit of a hit. But Joe
Mazarulli bore down to whiff the
third out.

State looked as if it would bust
the game wide open in their initial
time at bat. Pep Pizziilo walked,
stole second, and went to third on
a balk. Don McGurrin also walked
and stole second. The bases were
filled when Mike Putney took first
on a missed third strike.

De Joseph Stitles Peds

Then De Joseph came through
with a masterful performance. He
struck out Smith and Odorizzi and
got Don Mason to ground out.

Utica dented the plate in the
second on a walk, a single, a sac-
rifice bunt and a run producing
safety.

They again scored in the fourth.
An error and a line double to left
put runners on second and third.
Mazarulli got the next two batters,
but balked the run in.

Meanwhile the Peds were unable
to touch De Joseph’s side armed
tosses. They managed to get two
runners on via an error and walk
in the fifth; but the key hit was not
delivered.

State Defense Sparkles

A stiff State defense came up with
sparkling double play in the sixth.
A double and an infield hit put Utica
runners in scoring position. Then
on an attempted bunt, Mazarulli
fielded the ball in the air and
wheeled about to double the runner
at second.

The visitors scored the final run
of the game in the seventh. With

Tough 3-0 loss

two down, the batter singled to
left and scored when Van Shufflin
bashed a line hit to right.

State mounted its final threat of
the game in the bottom of the
eighth. Gary Smith singled with
one down. It was only State’s sec-
ond hit of the game. With two
down Mason was safe on an error.
But Chuck Mastrangelo fanned to
end the threat.

Mazurulll Takes Loss
Dick Kimball came on to relieve
Mazuruili in the eighth. Mazuruili
pitched a fine game allowing only
five hits and one earned run.
Kimball held the opposition in

check for remainder of the game.

De Joseph, however, proved in—
vincible and set down the Peds in
their last time at bat.

was regarded as a tough opponent
because of the top-notch compe-
tition that it had faced all season.
Coach Hathaway said: “I was op-
timistic about the match, but I had
not expected to win so decisively.”

John Barthelmes, number one
man, topped his opponent 6-2, 6-1.
Number two man Tom Slocum beat
his competitor 9-7, 6-3. In the

John Sturtevant copped his con-
test by scores of 6-3, 6-4. Ed Wol-
ner took his match 6-4, 6-4. Stur-
tevant-Wolner combined to notch a
7-5, 6-3 win in their doubles match.
Bill Enser recorded a 6-2, 6-2 vic-
tory, and Keith Costello took his
contest 6-4, 6-3.

Slocum and Enser have compiled
the best won-lost records on the
team. Both of them stand at nine
wins and only one loss for the sea-
son.

New Paltz Next Opponent
The Ped’s final match of the
season is Saturday at New Paltz.
The racqueteers have already met
New Paltz once this season. On
May 9 State edged the Hawks 5-4.
However, Coach Hathaway expects
an even tougher match this Satur-
day since New Paltz will have a

definite home court advantage.

MAY 22. 1964

VOL. L. NO. 18,

Senate Approves Culture Budgets;
\ISC Protests ASP Editorial Policy

25, is needed for passage.

Immediately Senator Gene Tobey
’65 moved to amend the budget to
add $500 to the line, Tobey, who is
also the President of the Music
Council, explained that they hoped
to schedule a concert by the Modern
Jazz Quartet.

After more than an hour
and a half of motions,
amendments, withdrawals,
and discussion, Senate
passed the Programming
section of the 1964-65 Stu-
dent Association budget.

As .n last week’s meeting, Mu-
sic Council provided the focus of
the debate. The Council had been
granted a guest artist line based
on the estimated contracts of five
artists.

One artist, Benny Goodman,whoni
the Council had hoped to contract
was unavailable, and the surplus
$2,050 in the line was what caused
the trouble.

Before it finally passed the pro—
gramming budget, deleting theextra
money, Senate had considered four
motions, two to delete the money,
and two to add to it.

Senator Udo Guddat ’66, Chair-
man of the Budget Committee, in-
troduced the main motion to ap-
prove the budget as submitted. To
this a motion was added to amend
it deleting the money frotn the line.

After long debate, the motion was
defeated by the close margin of 21
affirmative, 20 negative, and Z ab-
stentions. On such a motion a ma-
jority of the Senate, in this case

Include

Withdraws Motion.

Seeing ‘that the discussion was
getting nowhere, Guddat withdrew
his entire motion. He then moved to
approve the budget with a deletion
of the money in the controversial
line.

Tobey then moved to amend the
motion, changing the deletion to an
addition of $500 dollars.

At this point President Art John—
ston ’65 took the floor to impress
upon the Senators that “Robert’s
Rules were tnade to facilitate pro-
ceedings, not to play games." This
is i'idiculous...this maneuvering,”
he added.

lie told the Senators that several
important matters awaited their at-
tention and urged them to come to
a vote “if we‘re all through with
our playground games.”

Tobey’s motion was defeated by
a vote of 22-19-2, and Guddat's
motion lacked the necessary ma-
jority by one vote. Senator Al Bader
'65 then introduced a motion essen-
tially like Guddat's and this time
it passed 27-12-4.

ISC Protests "ASP"

Under new business, President
Johnston read a formal protest which
has been made to Senate by the In-
ter—Sorority Council against the
“Albany Student Press.” The ISC
charged that the “ASP” is “ violating
their purpose and policy as stated
in their constitution."

At 3:30 p.m. on Saturday, June
13, a reception for Seniors and their
parents will be given by President
and Mrs. Collins. The traditional
Torch Night ceremonies will be
held in the evening beginning at
'8:30 p.m. in Page Hall. The Class
of 1964 will present the Traditional
Skit after which the ceremonies
will be held.

Campus Christian Council is
sponsoring a lecture today at 1:25
in Draper 349 by Miss Tazu Shi-
bama, General Secretary of the
World Peace Study Mission. Miss
Shibama is currently touring the
United States with a learn of Hi-

sons of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

The hibakusha are traveling
around the world on a historic,
peace—seeking journey which in—
cltides countries suoh as England,
France, West and East Berlin, the
SOViet Union, and the mainland of
China. Arriving in New York, they
attended a short briefing session at
the United Nations.

The World Peace Study Mission
may be regarded as a pilot project
for international Cooperation Year,
which has been set for 1005 by the
United Nations. Fifty-six organi-
zations in the United States are
cooperating Willi this tour.

These include peace organiza-
tions, unions, the American Asso—

The protest cited six instances of
“violation” and charged bias and
failure “to promote an active and
enthusiastic spirit of loyalty to the
University." Five of the six cases
referred to statements made in
editorials.

The sixth protested “the motives
behind the coverage of the PhiDeita
party in the May 15 issue."

The ISC called for Senate “to
re-evaluate “ASP’s” fulfillment of
its policy and purpose, as stated in
their constitution." It alsoindl"'tted
its willingness “to cooperate in any
manner in an investigation of this
situation.”

President Johnston stated after
the tneeting that to the best of his
knowledge, this was the first such
protest made to Senate. He had no
immediate plans for action.

Rules Postponed

The adoption of Senate Rules for
1964-65, postponed frotn last week,
was again postponed after long and
futile debate. The debate centered
around the procedures for commit-
tee formation.

The Committee for Revision of
Senate Rules, chaired by Senator
Anne Digney ’66, had provided for
each committee to elect its own
officers. Several senators, as well
as President Johnston and former
President Pat Cerra ’64 felt that
the SA President should retain this
power.

The Committee refused to recon—
sider its proposals.

Just before adjournment, Senate
passed the revised bill procedure
bill and approved the Outing Club
constitution. Under its new consti-
tution, Outing Club no longer has
any connection with the Department
of Recreation.

of first hand accounts supplemented
by photographs, slides, movies, doc-

The hibakusha desire to exchange
information with all they meet, in
the hope that there will be “No
More Hiroshimas.” They want to
“help establish the international'
relationships which will prevent the
tragedies of future Hiroshimas and
Nagasakis.”

There will be a ttiirty foot trailer
at noon today outside the college at
the corner of Washington Avenue
and Robin Street. Inside will be

here and abroad, illustrating the
