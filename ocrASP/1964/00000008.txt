Mrs. Leue Feels Letter
l-las Undesired Effect

To the Editor:

Perhaps a certain amount of se-
lectivity is unavoidable in featuring
a story in a newspaper, but in the
case of the l'ASP’S" reporting of
my irate letter concerning the sor.
ority dance my husband and I chap-
eroned, you seem to have exceeded
this function in an unfortunate way,
a way which had the effect of dis-
torting the intent of my sending the
letter to you in the first place.

For the record, I should like to
repeat what I saidin the accompany-
ing letter which you did not print,
and to elaborate on this statement.

It was my feeling that such a
criticism of student behavior might

possibly be turned to a constructive
use by the student body, if, first,
it’s gendered by an immediate re-

action of revulsion and not to be
taken as wholesale condemnation,
and second, if it could be taken as

the starting gun for a discussion
of what may be wrong in terms of
student morale to produce such a
symptomatic phenomenon.

Both my husband and I feel there
is already a gap between faculty
and students, and there is an un-
fortunate sense of despair and alien-
ation among many students which is
not entirely their fault, but may be
at least partly related to the lack of
status New York accords toits state
university system - not officially,
but because of itscoinpetitive status
with private colleges.

This is the kind of thing David
Boroff was hinting at in his articles
on Albany State.

My intent was in no way repres-
sive, but rather the opposite, and
sprang from my reading a copy of
the “ASP” shortly after the inci-
dent of the dance, which gave me a
sense of healthy self—respect and
tough-iriindedness which seemed to

me might warrant a little plain talk
on a subject which needed airing.

Obviously, if its only resultsl ive
been to produce additional hostility
toward me as a representative of
authority, and to widen the already
existing gap by providing fuel for
anti-student sentiment both on the

campus and in the community, then
it has miserably failed in its pur-
pose.

If this is the case, I am deeply
sorry, but I do not feel that the
responsibility for this result lies
solely with myself.

By playing up the sensational as—
pects of the story, I am afraid the
“ASP” has done the student body
a disservice, and I only hope the
impression left can be corrected by
the—reporters who engendered it.

Mrs. William H. Loue

(Editor's Note: Since Mrs. Louo
did not mail her letter to the
"ASP" until over 0 week after

she wrote it, we could not regard
It as o more "intomporoto blast."
ll Mrs. Laue hoped to kick off a
discussion of campus morals in
her letter, hor moons of doing so
were quite unusual.

The letter was in the nature of
a formal, responsible uttaclt on
the behavior of a group of stu-
dents. As such, it could not be
handled by the "ASP" in any
other manner.

Students Feel Maintaining
Dippiltill Worthwhile

To the Editor:

This letter is written to correct
blatant distortions which were put
forth in the May 19 editorial on
Camp Dippikili.

First, the statement is made that
the Camp is “horribly expensive to
run and maintain." Just how much
is “horribly expensive?" The total
cost of running and maintaining the
Camp for this school year was ap—
proximately $460. This amounts to
less than 16 cents per student per
school year.

 

The statement is made that “the
average State student does not have
a car and has Very little prospect
of ever obtaining a car during his
stay at the University."

If this is true, then who owns the
cars that fill up our student parking
lot every day? Over 2000 student
parking permits have been issued
this year. Also, you don’t need a
car for every student, one in six
will do (sic).

You state that Camp Board has
had a “lack of success in per-
suading people to go to the Camp
..". When has Camp Board ever
attempted to persuade anyone to
use the Camp?

Due to the inactivity oilastyear’s
Camp Board, no encouragement at
all was given to the students. What
is needed is support of Dippikill by
student associations such as the
“ASP” to further encourage stu-
dents to use the Camp.

You further state that Dippikill
is about 90 miles north of Albany.
In fact, it is 72 miles from the
dorms to the door of the Camp;
which due to the Nortliway, is an
hour and a half traveling time.

legitimate News Story

We seem to have stirred things up a little with our
treatment of Mrs. Leue’s letter last week. We have
been accused of “sensationalism” in making a front
page story out of the contents of the letter.

We disagree with anyone who says the story was
written purely to “sensationalize.” Mrs. Leue’s letter
was legitimate material for a front page story. We
say this for the following reasons.

(1) Writing a letter to the editor of the “ASP” made
it in the nature of a public attack.

(2) To the best of our knowledge this is the first
time a chaperone at any student event has come right
out and condemned the actions of the participants.

(3) Mrs. Leue’s charges were .2ompletely respon-
sible; she was not throwing barb-n Common Stater stylc.
She was an official chaperone at the party; part of her
duty in this capacity as chaperone was to speak out if
anything was amiss in her belief. This she did.

(4) Finally, the letter made no mention of a specific
sorority. To have printed this letter, without making
clear exactly what the letter was all about, would hill't‘
been a farce.

There was nothing irresponsible in the manner in
which the “ASP” handled the story. The sisters oi
Phi Delta were given a chance three days before thc
paper came out to write a rebuttal to the charges in
the letter.

The paper handled the story like it would handle any
news story. If it seems “sensational” it is due only to
the nature of the story, not to the way the “ASP” pro—
sented it.

construction on the tower of the first dormitory unit.

In order to raise the lower 22
stories high, this huge derrick is
placed in the middle of the tower
construction. With the aid of this
far-reaching machine story after
story is set into place.

For heavy construction such as
this, the steel skeleton is maneu—
vered by means of the crane.

All along the derrick are perched
various workmen. They manipulate
levers and pulleys and direct the

efforts of the crane operator.

Besides tower Work. the derrick
is also used to carry and set large
sections of walls into place. The
walls of the buildings are con—
structed of prefabricated concrete
block.

Without the aid of such a heavy-
duty machine, rapid construction
of our University would be impos-
sible.

statement was made by James R.
Dunne, in charge of Public Rela-
tions for the State University Con-
struction Fund.

Headquarters for the Fund are
on Washington Avenue. Established

I in 1962 by the State legislature,

the Fund serves as a focal point
of coordination for the construction

‘ of all academic buildings throughout

the entire State University for the
University’s Master Plan.

Mr. Dunne was found amid count-
less blue prints and news releases
covering all facets of construction.
He was able to supply much overall
information with respect to anissue
concerning all of us at State;namely

Sands and Road:
Mr. Dunne was first questioned
about the sand and road problems.
Concerning the sand he said "up to
this time approximately sixty per-
cent of the campus, excluding that
set aside for buildings, has been
planted with grass. To avoid blow-
ing sand much of the land has been
soaked with oil.”
The problem cannot be circum-
vented completely, however.
As it looks now, there will be one
road paved for use in September.
This is excluding the service roads.
When asked about the possibility of
other roads to allow students the
luxury of walking from one end to
the other, Mr. Dunne said, “but
with only one building , why are'
roads necessary?”

Campus construction is being done
in three stages. The first stage is
scheduled for completion by Sep—
tember of 1964. This includes all
underground preparation and serv-
ice buildings.

Academic Complex
Next on the agenda are the aca—
demic buildings. The academic com-
plex consists of general classrooms
and laboratories. The schedule for

Science, Chemistry, Physics, Bio-
logy Library, and Student-Faculty
Center.

1966 will see the completion of:
Business Education, Fine Arts,
Earth Science, Theatre, and Admin-
istratiVe buildings.

“The space is being used as
economically and compactly as pos-
sible" said Dunne. The dorms are
being constructed in such a way
that floors and wings can be added
as the enrollment increases.

To avoid the elements, colonnades
are provided to enable a student to
go from building to building and
dining hall without having to brave
sun or storm.

Control Dining Rooms

Each dormitory complex will
house 1,100 students with 440 in
the 22-story towers and 660 in the
3-story units. Central dining facil-
ities for each complex will seat.
about 550 students.

One of the outstanding features
of new campus living “firsts” next

Western Avenue. If a way to the
lake is found, preferably an over-
land route, the lake will provide
many hours of ice skating.

there."

For each portion of the Univer-
sity conStruction bids are accepted.
So far a different company has the
contract for the first part of‘tlio
academic complex than the one who
is doing the dormitory complex.
Each bid is worth several million
dollars.

Clone: in Library

The Library is designed for a
total volume capacity of 1,000,000
volumes and more than ‘3,000
readers. Initially, this building will
be used to supplement the class-
room space. Gradually, however,
it will be utilized for classes as
enrollment increases.

The Student-Faculty Center will
be equipped with a cafeteria, day”
rooms for commuters, and social,
recreational, and club rooms.

The College Theatre, seating 500,
will provide band and choral prac-
tice rooms. in addition, an arena
theatre and recital hall will be pro-
vided.

The layout of the academic com-
plex pivots around the Lecture Hall
Center. This includes instructional
aids space and lecture rooms for
the whole University.

New Campus Problems
Require ‘Understanding’

“We hope for a sympathetic re-
sponse from an understanding stu-
dent body” said Colonel Walter Tis-
dale, assistant to the president,
while talking about some of the
problems that students will encoun-
ter at the new campus in Septem-
ber.

Those students making the move,
in September will find two men’s
and four women’s residence units
of the first dormitory complex com-
pleted.

There will be one paved road
from either Fuller Road or Western
Avenue to the dormitory complex.
There will also be four contractors
roads.

Parking Lot

A thousand car parking lot is
being built between the first dor-
iiiltory complex and the service
building. Part of it will be usable
in September. There will probably
be no restrictions on student cars-
at first.

The suites will be furnished with

an easy chair and bed for each
resident. There will be five win-
dows, each a foot wide and six
feet high.

There will be a sand problem,
but the University is “doing all

it can" to combat this problem.
Grass has been planted and drift
fences have been erected. The ten-
nis court site will be covered to
eliminate snnd there.

“Sand is there; we cannot per-
form iiiii'acles,” said Colonel ’l‘ls-

dale. The residents faring the tower
construction site will have 2: def-
inite pi'obleiii with sand.

Bus Transportation
llus transportation will also be
provided. The University has given
the- United Traction Company esti—
mates of the iiuiiibci' of students
who will have classes at various
hours and they will provide enough
transportation for them.

There will probably be three bus
runs per hour, starting about 7:30
in the "writing. The Schedule for
weekend buses is not definite. It
is “inevitable” that some students
will he inconvenienced at first.

The buses will probably come
down Western Avenue, stop at the
old quadrangle, Draper Hall, and
Detroit Annex and then circle around
to return via Washington Avenue.

 

 

Colonel Walter Tisdolo
...Assistont to President

Eating hours will inevitably be
modified, and possibly hours. The
dining room for the residence com-
plex will be connected to all the
individual units.

The possibility of establishing a
branch of the Student Union in Sep-
tember is being considered. There
will be a wide variety of vending
machines in the dormitories.

There will also be game rooms
in the dorms.

It is hoped that the telephones
in the suites will be installed in
Septeiiilier, but there is the pos-
sibility that they will not be ready
then.

Bicycles to be Important

Colonel 'l‘isdale said that bicycles
will become more important on the
new campus for transportation. Bike
racks will be installed and the
Co-op will begin selling bikes, for
the students’ convenience.

Stuyvesant Plaza is close to the
campus for recreation as a new
theatre is beliig built there this
summer.

The students who are moving out
there in September will probably
show the University many ways
where improvements are needed,
for the experts have said that it is
impossible to operate a college one

do the impossible. A
