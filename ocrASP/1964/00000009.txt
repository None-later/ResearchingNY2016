arise is in itself an insane act of
hate and aggression.

To cast aspersions on the good
name of Charlie Silvera and to
bluntly .state, as Mr. .(hal) Atwell
did in the last frame of his "car-
toon," that all those connected with
baseball possess deformed mouths
is a direct slap in the face to both-
the American and National Leagues
(which number among their players
’many Puerto Ricans and Negroes),
and is synonomous with an attack
upon State’s stolid nine, the AMIA
softball teams, and the “ASP's”
own Ron Hamilton.

1 hate to stoop below ..Atwell’s
level, but I honestly feel I must‘
inform him that, as any ball fan
knows, the team holler guy is never
the pitcher. I must also object to
the use of the unequivocal term
“barogue” in reference to Lightnin’
Hopkins’ surf board.

To the Editor:

As is usual with me, 1 would
like to address a comment or two
to the current “ASP” editor.

First, let me say that Ifeei that
the paper has improved immeas-
urably tn the past few weeks (see
my letters to previous editor -
if they are available).

It is particularly pleasurable to
find less space given to rather
trivial student frolics and more
space given to broader issues; and
to matters which, while disturbing,

do “make a difference.”

It would be higltly pleasurable to

-continue in a positive manner, but

...there is a need to point out that
there is a large difference between
honest, forthright presentation of
issues and irresponsible vituperi-
fication.

This need is associated with the
evidence provided by one of your
editor’s (who can’t disguise his
vituperttiveness by adopting
phrases) recurrent sliding into the
use of overt, ttigttly personal highly
charged vilification.

This editor should be soundly
schooled in the negative value of
acquiring “ad liominem” - when
he has learned his lessons, lie

Student Considers ASP
News Story Slanderous

To the Editor:

More than once have Ifound cause
to be annoyed with your inefficient
reporting teclmiques and inept edi-
torializing, but your headline of
Friday, May 15 was the poorest.
journalistic attempt ever.

It is one thing to publish the
letter of a misinformed, antiquated,
hysteria] individual whose letter

‘only served to illustrate a mis-
.understanding of the college cont—

munity. But to exaggerate the entire
affair out of all possible propor—
tlott - using specific names — as
you did, can be considered ttotlting
less titan slander.

There was no need to single out
a particular fraternal organization
for actions (as innocent as they
were) that could be applied to any
sorority or fraternity on any cam-
pus anywhere. Are you so desper-

rights ' rally recently held in the

Union.

It is true — it was a veritable
milestone in the history of the Uni-
versity. It is just a pity that in an
era of alertness and’awareness about
civil rights that this University is
just beginning to awaken. It is diffi-
cult to understand how a community
of 3,500 young people can shrug off
responsibility for this great issue.

Further appalling is the fact that

“congratulations” were extended
for this apathy. The reason Why the
bulk of the,students stayed away
from' the rally does not include
their “common sense” in its scope.

The editorial indicates that the
Student Union rally is an adequate
example of the civil rights move-
ment on this campus.

Things would be brought to proper
perspective had the editor perhaps
attended one of more than ten meet-
ings that have been held over the
past two months at various sites
in Albany (which I may add were
attended by eminent Albany clergy-
men and professors from our Uni-
versity).

If criticism is to be given, let it
be constructive.

The fact that the civil rights bill
is in its 60th day of debate and will
be considerably watered down when
and if passes shows that “a mature
and sane working out of the issues”
is not providing the necessary 100-
year overdue reforms.

Lastly, it is with awe that 1 com-
ment on the editor’s dubious ability
to tag adjectives (“obnoxious atid
misguided”) on a movement which
so recently developed on our cant-
pus.

It seems to me that before such
slanderous judgments are passed on
fellow students and their efforts to.
speed a solution to what currently
rattks as one of the greatest issues,
more open-minded thinking would
be done.

To the Editor:

It is appropriate that the Editor
of “ASP” seek an effective response
on the part of' this University to the
civil rigltts question now before the
nation. However, his evaluation Off
the Mississtppl Summer Project
seems irresponsible and his pre-
scriptions as to a future course of
action vague.

On Sunday, May 10, the Project
held an open meeting iii the Student
Uttiott to bring the various commit-
tees together for a progress report.
After a summary description of the
Project for those not already in~
volved, reports were heard on the
book drive and the collectlott of
funds to finance a State team of
volunteers.

“Totally misguided," says tlte
“ASP”, of this sort of activity. We
ask people to conttttit themselves
to the cause of civil rights; is this
what is meant by “misguided?”
We advocate action [it the fields of
education and voter registration; is
this “misguided?”

Regretfully, we tttust also point
out a small inaccuracy inthe“ASl"’
editorial. No one refused to serve
customers titrougltout the entire
meeting. One student, Robert Clark
’67, declined to cook hamburgers
during the singing of the closing
song, "We Shall Overcome."

with the Raleigh Voter Registra-

Then, on April 29, an open meet-

'ian Council, was held to organize
the Mississippi Summer Project.
Although the meeting waspublicized

organizations, less than 50 people

and action.
America become truly aplace"with

Nevertheless, working commit-
tees were formed to raise funds,
organize a book drive, and recruit

volunteers. The thirty faculty and
students now involved represent a
wide variety of social backgrounds
and interest.

Fraternity members, independ-
ents, people from all walks of life,
all religious backgrounds, white and
black, are now at work. No clique,
no one power group, has “gained
control” of the project or of the
civil rights movement at State.

Those active in the Mississippi
Summer Project do not see sending
books and students as a panacea; it
is a positive, first step towards pro-
viding education and leadership in
an area of the Country where both
are sorely lacking.

True, civil rights is an issue which
“will be resolved only through a
mature, sane working out of the
issues.” Therefore, we are glad to
extend a warm invitation to the staff
of “ASP” and its readers to help with
concrete suggestions and by their
active participation.

To this end, we welcome them
to our next meeting, scheduled for
7:30 p.m., Sunday, May 24.

To the Editor:

The very misguided “Civil Rights
Mis-Guided” editorial in last Fri-
day's “ASP” displayed not only an
attitude of depreciation of our civil
rigltts movement, but also of the
whole student body.

It displayed, as well, a sad atti-
tude of “let the other fellow do it”
which unfortunately prevails among
so many people in America, the
nation where each individual is so
important itt formittg what it repre-
sents.

Ttte editor’s mention of the “ob-
noxious character of the civil rigltts
movement” on our campus is a
very obvious attempt to give the
movement a reputation which it has
ttot, in reality, acquired. My own
involvement fit one phase of the
Freedom Summer Project ltas shown
itte what the movement’s reputation
on campus is.

In participating in the book drive
I have experienced a positive re—
action to the Mississippi “Freedom
Summer" project on the part of
many students. The amount oi'books
given is an indication of this posi—
tive attitude toward what the civil
rights group is Working to accom-

plish.
The editor mentions that civil
rights is an important issue in

America today. I hope that as stu-
dents and as future citizens, Albany
State students have the rigttt to
make tltemselVes a part of this very
important issue that confronts all
Atneriwns.

i hope that We may consider our—
selves significant enough to hold
opinions about such serious issues
and to act, to do something about
the way we feet. If sottte ol' our at-
tempts to act involve mistakes —
and i am not referring to any spe-
cific event - at least we have given
ourselves the chance to learn, to
grow so that perhaps our next ac-
tions will be more mature arid ef-
fective.

At least We have taken a stand,

assumed a responsibility toward

an issue very dear to and
chosen to work to effect somochatigc
where we tltink change is greatly
needed.

The incident in the Student Union
was an attempt to make students
more actively aware of the “Free-
dotn Summer” project.

Perhaps the main objection of
some students to such a tactic is
because of their preference for a

This year Arena Theatre, the
only arena theatre in the Albany
area, will be in its thirteenth year

of consecutive production. Because.

of its uniformly high standards, it
has gained the reputation of being
one of the finest summer theatres
in the Northeast.

In recent years some of the most
noteworthy productions were “Wait-
ing for Godot,” “Twelve Angry
Men,” and “Uncle Vanya.”

Last summer, Arena Theatre pre-
sented “Biedermann and the Fire-
bugs,” by Max Frisch, “The Em-

Primer Fiction Pleasing, Diverse

by Bruce Danlels

The prose iii this year’s “Prim-
er” displays a diversity of style
and contettt that is a credit both to
the writers and the judicious selec-
tion on the part 'of editor Joe Gomez
and his literary staff.

The fiction ranges from broad
farce to parables and reminiscences
to sensitive and impressionistic
poems in prose, and the net effect
is one ofopleasing variety and in-
terest.

Particularly outstanding in the
collection are last year’s Loven-

lteim award—winner, “Totnmorrow
and Tomorrow and,” by Roland
Esolen; William Murdlck’s “When
Jesus Christ Descended...” and Sam
Cypressi’s “Maha-Prajna Lady
Bug."

Esolen’s fable of a frustrated,
middle-aged widow giving up her
“last chance" for sexual fulfill-
tnent is a superb blending of fantasy
attd psychological truth - main-
taittlng a neat balance of humor and
pathos.

Murdick’s story of Jesus Christ

ney’s Bar and Poolroom is an un-

Pessimism, Monotony
Burden Primer Verse

by Leslie Harris

Last week the “Primer” for 1964
was distributed iii the peristyle
beneath Draper. This anthology of
short fiction, poetry, essays, and
art selections is supposed to be
representative of the creative abil-
ity of our student body.

Judging front the poetry selec-
tiotts included this year, however,
our student body does ttot have
ntuch creative ability.

Depressing

Your reviewer ltad ttot expected
anything quite so depressing when
site sat down to set down lter judg»
ments and carefully constructed
criticisms.

Poem after morbid poem paraded
before her dampening eyes. As she
reached page 102 a strangling
scream eseaped her tightly coni-
pressed lips. Shetltrewherselfdown
on the ashes of" the “Primer” for
1903 and wept.

Almost without exception our bud-
ding poet laureates crushed, ruth-
lessly crushed any gleams of hap-
piness or optimisim that itttgltt have
penetrated throttgh the rather thick
pages of the “Printer.”

Almost without exception our
posts shied away front the more
taxing verse forms, and as a result
there was little relief front the
monotony of the very blank, blank
verse.

Exception

The single exception was “The
Founding of Lavhtium,” by James
F. Eddy. Eddy tackled, not only
rltytned verse, but also tried his
hand ‘ dialogue itt rhymes.

Although the content of the poem
does ttot lend itself to galety, the
result of the cross dialogue is a
delightful short poem. Fortunately,
titers were other attempts at unity

through rhyme.

 

“A Study in Negativism,” by Joyce
Cottone was such an attetnpt. Miss
Cotone used parallel rhyming ittlter

'two verse poem. Unfortunately tier

very promising way wit 1 words
was demonstrated on such a hack-
tteyed subject.

Satisfying Effort

For sentimentalists, “Sestina:
The Sound of Laughter,” by Mary
Lou McGrade is satisfying and dis-
plays a very lovely sense of words
and rhythm.

Nevertheless, the undertone of
sadness that runs through the poem
and is capped iii the last tltree
lines, reminds the reader that this
poetry collection can only be safely
read on a bright, sunshiny day.

likely but uproariously funny cont-
bination of Damon Runyon, “The
Iceman Comettt,” and the “Book
of Revelation.”

By exploding every expectation
and creating violent and ridiculous:
contrasts, Murdick has turned a
potentially somber situation (drun-
kenness, despair, perversion, char-
latanry) into a highly successful bit
of “dark comedy."

Sensitive Tale

“The Maha-Prajna Lady Bug”
tells of a young man who exchanges
a precious but impossible dream
for a bleak and dubious “matur-
ity.”

The story itself is essentially
romantic and rather commonplace,
but is told with exceptional control
and sensitivity.

Others contributing fiction to the
1964 “Primer” were Robert Judd,
Amy Weiss, Joyce Keefer, Gloria
Avner, Mary Lou McGrade, Walter
Feuersteitt, Joe Gomez and William
Tompkins.

Essay Valuable

Dr. Berger’s essay on “Existen-
tial Criticism in Educational
Theory" was a valuable addition to
“Primer” in a number of ways.
First, it demonstrated the need for
provocative criticism (literary or
philosophical) of a too-“serious,”
ever-organized society.

Secondly, its very appearance
opens the way for more essays and
criticism in “Primer” itself.

Though “Primer” istt’t likely to
create a scandal this year, there is
enough talent and thoughtfulness as-v
sembled in the 1964 issue to make
it well wortlt reading.
