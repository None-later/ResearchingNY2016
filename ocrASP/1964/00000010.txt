Baseball Team Ends Year At Utica,

Weak Fielding

By Jim Wingete

Ruins Season Record

Saturday afternoon the State nine close out the 1964 baseball season with a
return match against New Paltz. Playing the game at New Paltz, the visiting Peds
hope to finish the season on a high note by bringing home a revenge victory. In the
first meeting between these two clus, New Paltz won a sluggfest, 14010. Coach
Burlingame will probably start either Don McGurrin or Joe Mazurulli.

Don has not been as effective on the mound this year as he was last year, but
has one victory to his credit. McGurr’in has done well at short all year and he may

 

HAMMING
IT UP

The things that happened this year are too unbeliev-
~ able to tell. but there are a few stories that sum up
what kind of a year it was very well.

The first takes us back to the early weeks of school.

.After writing a not too complimentary column about the
soccer team, yours truly was trapped in the Mayﬂower
by a rather irate soccer coach and.....

Then there was the time the captions were mixed up
by the printer and picture of Dick Crossett was labeled

“as “Marty Eppner getting of a quick shot”  Then
came prognostication. Well, what can we say. We
thought it would add a little color, but we had no idea
that we were creating a monster....

At the end of basketball season we had a big head-
line declaring the wrong team winner of the AMIA
second league... Then there was the Latin American
problem that keeps sports editors from signing up for
certain history courses... The wrestling coach was
never pleased with his coverage, but then all wrestling
coaches feel persecuted...

by Bee Homilies

 

Moments of glory did shine through the clouds when
the sports section received an excellent rating from the
professional reviewer, such to the chagrin ofour sweet,
diplomatic senior editor.... The icing for the cake came
when a demented sports editor wrote a poem, but alas
the golden words fell on wooden ears.

Enough for the past. what is in store for the future?
For the first time the sports department will have an
English major at the helm. A rather pleasant change.
Harold shows more potential than his predecessor, if
we can ever get him to work.

We would like to thank one person for an outstanding
job. ’i‘hosc Wednesday night paste ups were a thankless
job, but they were always done with the perfectionist,
touch. We think your the greatest Ellen.

Keep smiling and try playing a sport instead of just
watching.

be left there to bolster
the infield for the final
game. Mazurulli was the
losing pitcher in State’s
3-0 loss to Utica.

“Max” pitched a fine game, al-
lowing only five hits and one earned
run. The team has been plagued
with poor fielding for three weeks.
In the last outing the defensive play
was back to the type of the four
game winning streak in the begin-
ning of the year.

Pep Pizzilio, Dick Odorizzi fig-
ure to finish the season as State's
leading hitters. Dick is hitting at

Hathaway Worried

Coach Hathaway was worried
about; the encounter tomorrow.
“‘They have clay courts down there
and that is a lot different than we
are use to.” He also mentioned Ed
Wolner’s illness this week that has
prevented Ed from practicing.

With the year almost over Hath-
away did a little speculating about
next year’s prospects. “Our num-
ber one man, Ken Zacharias, is
going to make it. He has shown a
lot in the past season," said the
Coach.

“We are losing Sturtevant and
Barthelmes and that is going to
hurt us,” he added. Sturtevant and
Barthelmes have been providing the
team with fine play for three years.
