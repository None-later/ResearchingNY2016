Record-shattering enrollments, plus unclear tie-
ups in dormitory construction, combined three weeks
ago to force the University to house 600 students in
Albany area motels. The University had planned to
locate these 600 in new campus dormitories this
semester, but construction was delayed so that the

Decisions Delayed Campus

According to Mr. Clifton C. Flat-
her, Administration Director of the
Dormitory Authority, under whose
auspices the new dorm complexes
a. e being built, the initial delays in
the building of the dorms lay in
complex inter-related decisions.

Other contractors are responsible
for various other stages and parts
of the total campus. In some cases
their work interfered with that of
the Dormitory Authority, and delays
up to three weeks resulted.

Slow downs in getting shop nia-
teriais approved and unusual situa-
tions such as compacting the soil on
the site were also cited as. delays.

Over all this, there has been a
shortage of electrical Works which
resulted in a tie-up in all the other
inter-related trades.

Flaiher stressed the fact that in
building the second dormitory com-
plex, the problems oimurringduring
the building of the first have been
taken into account, and in many lil-
siances, newer and faster methods
have been employed. This complex
is currently ahead of schedule.

Four Motels Rented

Four motels have been rented at
a cost of approximately $1800 daily
until the complexes are sufficiently
completed and livable.

Tivo hundred womenare nowiiving
in the Thruway Motel on Washington
Avenue, and two hundred more are
in the Town House Motel on Route
20. One hundred twenty-six men
are in the Country Squire Motel
and seventy-four are in Governor's
Motel.

The administration has managed
to arrange this temporary housing,
putting original roommates io-
gethei‘.

Both the Country Squire and Gov-
ernor’s Motels have eating facili-
ties for breakfast right on the prem-
ises.

The Women in the Town House will
eat breakfast in the Hot Shoppes near
them, and those in the Thruway Will
eat at the State Campus Office Build-
ing cafeteria.

All of the 600 students will be
transported to the State Office Build-
ing cafeteria [or dinner. None of
these students are to have dinner
at either Brubacher or Alden-Wa-
terbury dining halls in case they
happen to be at the Residence Quad-
rangie.

Bus Schedule in Operation

been devised to transport those

Plans I mprovement in, Public Relations

Dr. Samuel B. Gould officially
took office on September 1 as pres-
ident of the State University of
New York. lie ends a 20—month
vacancy in the office created when
Dr. Thomas H. i-iamiitor. resigned
to assume the presidency of the
University of Hawaii.

Dr. Gould plans to spend the
first year acquainting liimselfwith
the system of 59 units and 68,000
full-time students which is now
under his jurisdiction. lie also iii—
tends to make a complete study of
staff organization, filling only those
vacancies which are absolutelynec-
essary.

Plans for Ducontralizatlon

In expressing his plans for lead-
ership, be indicated that “general
decentralization is the path we will
probably follow." “A great state
university will emerge from the
units able to go on their own,” he
declared.

Dr. Gould believes that a lack
of information, or misinformation
about the university system has
resulted in a general underrating
by the public. He therefore sees
himself as becoming an “inter-
preter for the university" — spread-
ing information, and improving its
public image.

Graduated from Bates College in
Maine, Dr. Gould received his Mai.
from New York University in 1030.

lie taught English in New England
high schools, and worked for a time
for the New England Telephone and
Telegraph Co.

After serving as lieutenant coin-
mnnder hi the Navy during the wa_r,
he went to Boston University where
he established a department ofcom-
munication arts.

in 1954 he became president of
Antioch College in Ohio, where he
served five years. He then became
chancellor of the University ofCali-
fornia at Santa Barbara. When ap-
pointed by imiversity trustees last
June, he was president of the Ed—
ucational Broadcasting Corporation
in New York City.

Dr. Samuel Gould

Dr. Gould has received two lion-
orary doctorate of laws degrees.
One was awarded him by Bates in
1957, the other by Wilberforce Uni-
versity in 1900.

A series of bills passed by the
1904 New York State Legislature
has been cited as a contributing
factor in ending the vacancy in the
presidential office.

Foremost among these was a bill
raising the salary from $28,000 to
$40,000 a year. Dr. Gould will also
receive $10,000 for expenses and
the use of a house and a car. Other
bills cleared away some of the red
tape which has surrounded the office.

Financial Independence
The president now has morepower
in handling pay raises and promo-
lions for the staff. University funds
will be apportioned in a lump sum,
making it possible for him to use
money where it is most needed.

In connection with this greater
financial independence, the Legis-
lature voted to remove the pro-
vision which required that the Board
of Education approve the SUNY bud-
get.

Dr. Gould commented that the
“...iegislutive changes have made
it possible to build this into the
kind of unified state university that
New York should have."
