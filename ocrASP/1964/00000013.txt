Keyed to Five Aims

The Summer Planning Conference was
built around fulfilling five basic aims to
aid the orientation of the Class of ’68
to life at State. As stated by Dean Neil
'Brown, Coordinator of the Summer Con-
ference, these purposes were

(1) To acquaint the frosh with student
life at the University.

(2) To meet their permanent academic
advisors.

(3) To plan a full program for first
semester.

(4) To project with academic advisors
future program leading towards fulfill-
ment of degree requirements.

(5) To accomplish the steps of pre-
registration.

Program Co-ordinoior,

ilean Brown Sees Fresh Attitudes,
Program Itself as Excellent Signs

by Dean Nell Brown
Coordinator Summer Conference

The recently completed Summer
Planning Conference, a "new-look"
in the orientation of freshmen en-
tering the State University of New
York at Albany, has been an enjoy-
:tbie experience for all staff mem-
iers.

Each of the ten groups of fresh-
men with whom we worked was
unique, yet we may rilate certain
basic observations as we survey
the entering class as a whole.

Confidence In Future

It gave us confidence in the future
of “Albany State" as the freshmen
spoke of their pride in and err-
thuslasm for our University -— not
only as it presently exists, but also
what it is to become in the months
and years ahead.

We were very much impressed
by the attitude of our new students
as they displayed their willingness
to accept the disadvantages along
with the advantages of our Univer-
sity's growth.

This trespaaks to us a maturity
on the part of the Class of '68
which will help to guarantee the

further growth oi our University,
in spirit as well as physical plant.

We observed with pleasure the
maturity of their thoughts and values
as we discussed the freedoms and
concomitant responsibilities ofUni-
versity Life.

University Project

The Summer Planning Confer—
ence represents a University com-
munity project in the fullest sense
of the meaning.

Students, teaching faculty, and
administrative faculty participated
in the formulation, execution, and
the evaluation of this new venture.

This close working relationship,
applied to the many projects of this
particular decade in the Univer-
sity’s growth, will serve to benefit
to the greatest-possible ektent this
academic community.

Challenges Important

it is such ventures its the Sunr-
mei‘ Planning Conference which are
the true test of the University's
abilities to meet the challenges and
the future it has prepared forliself.

Judging from the unqualified suc-
cess of this program, the Univer-
sity is well on its way to meeting
these new commitments.

Student Adviser Agree on Success

Sourselnr Stresses Need, Impedance
For Sensible Summer Orientation

by Nancy Baumann

A Fresh Weekend might be ade-
quate for a State Teachers College‘
with a freshmen class of seven
hundred plus students, but such a
program does not meet the needs
of a University whose entering
freshmen class numbers over 1190.

We have increasingly academi-
cally oriented University where a
student's success is partially de—
pendent on his,a(ijustment to Uni-
versity living.

Only when it freshman is aware
of what the University offers can
he st goals that are both realistic
and broad.

Picnics and dances emphasizes
only a facet of University life. An
orientation program of a more scr-
ious nature was needed to reflect
a more complete picture of Uni-
versity life.

Pave Way

it needed to make freehmanawure
of the opportunities available at the
University and to help pave the way
for their adjustment to University
life by suggesting problems they
might face and possible ways to
solve these problems.

With this in mind, a committee
of students and faculty met last
spring and developed a new or-
ientation program. The plan be-
aimeduibzgnllity this summer and

The Student Advisors of the bum—
mer Planning Conference heartily
agreed.

During the summer months, over
1100 freshmen attended one oi tin-
ten sessions of the Summer l’iun-
nlng Conference.

Before their arrival, they were
mailed pamphlets which described
University services such as finan-
cial aids, counseling and health
services. As a result, each fresh-
man’s schedule included the gun—
ei'al activities of the Summer Pinn-
nlng Conference plhs ﬂppulnlillents
with the special services they re-
quested.

lndivldual Treatment

One of the most important parts
of the freshman program was the
freshman's individual appointment
with an academic advisor from the
University College.

Another important
conference was the small grout!
discussions held in the evening,

tei'mining his own success and the

'l‘he well-organized orientation
program which greeted the members
of the Class of ’68 this past summer
was the product of much planning
and thought for well over a year.

It was with MYSKANIA of 1963
that the first long look at the tra-
ditional Frosh Weekend and Rivalry
was taken. It was felt that the rapid
expansion of the University would
soon, if it had not already, make
these programs obsolete.

Committee Farmed

A committee was established un-
der Dean Neil C. Brown, who was
to eventually become co-ordinaior
of the Summer Conference, to study
the rapidly changing situation.

Originally the committee was not
charged with devising an entirely
v new system of orientation; its main

THE FilRST LOOK at dormitory load can be an unnerving experience lor any man but as the second
It“ ture shows, most trash quickly adjusted to Walden cuisine.

 

     

As the committee became deeper
involved in the problems of fresh
orientation, however, it rapidly be-
came apparent that a new, more
effective program was needed if
the needs of the University and the
freshmen themselves were to be
met.

Old Programs Faulty

Objections to Frosh Weekend and
Rivalry centered around the facts
that freshmen Were herded around
too much and not given enough indi-
vidual attention and that not enough
emphasis was placed on the aca-
dernlc aspects of University life.

In the words of one committee
member if was a matter of now
providing “a slice of life, not the
spice of life."

The Fresh Orientation Committee
as it logically enough came to be
called was chaired by Dean Brown.
The cotnmittee was comprised of
administrators and students alike.

This committee meeting some-
times as a whole, but more often
as sub-groups, worked throughout
the last academic year to devise a
workable and beneficial orientation
program for the sootr-to-come Yel-
low Jackets.

The result was the inclusion of
much new material (mainly with an
academic emphasis) in
