Despite its heavy emphasis, 'the
Simmer Orientation Prwram was
not devoted entirely to theacademic
problems of University life.

For the fresh a special bus tour,
a very special physical fitness test,
and the chance for informal dances
and volleyball games on dorm field,
were also provided.

Iua Tour

The bus tour, which included a
trip to the trap of the Alfred E.
Smith building, gave the fresh a
quick two-hour look (if traffic was
right) at the old campus and an-
nexes and more importantly at the
work on the new campus.

Most of the important buildings
in the city were pointed out by the
student advisers, in conjunctionwith
one friendly bus drive who nlade it
n hllilit to show what he affectionate-
ly termed "O'Heany’s Oasis."

The physical fitiless test, ad-
ministered try Conch Jesetharcia,
was not one of the more popular
aspects of the program with the
hush. The tests consisted of seven
events designed to test the speed,
reflexes, and conditioning of each
of the fresh.

Somehow the prospect of running
Vigorous 50-yard dashes, straining
long-unused muscles 1:: cllin ups,
and just plain straining, did not

appeal to those fresh who bad Just
had their first dormitory meal an
hour before. '

On the final day of each session
the fresh were put through the
stages of pro-registration, thus
avmiding the big jam up- that char-
acterized freshman registration in
the past.

Prior to this, the fresh were able
to consult with their academic ad-
visers in order to draw up a sched-
ule of classes.

Free Time

Despite the number of important
programs that were carried out dur-
ing each group's two-day stay,
scheduling was such that the fresh
had a substantial amount of free
time in which to acquaint themselves
with the University.

Shopping sprees in the CO-OP,
volleyball games, walks around the
campus, or a cake in the Student
Union helped to fill these hours.
It was also a time for the fresh
to get to know the people who will
be their classmates for the next
four years.

All in all, the Summer Planning
Conference did all it could to pro-
vide the aimed for “Slice of life,
not spice of life" at State.

At each stop the students will
either all be let off or all picked

In case of emergency, the school
has purchased two trusses. At times
these will be put in service along
with the other Transit buses.

All the students living ill the

TRADITIONAL: SYMB
dlclight ceremony Monday.

    

Singing the traditional “Follow
the Gleam" torch song, the class
of 1968 filed into Page Hall, where
the Beanie induction Ceremony took
place Monday evening.

At 8:30 p.m. President Evan R.
Collins lit the torches of the four
academic deans, signaling thelight-
ing of the fresllmen’s candles.

As the Yellow Jackets streamed
into Page, it appeared that there
wouldn’t be enough beanies, but the
real problem was seating the 1180
students. The side aisles and back
provided sufficient standing space.

Dr. Walter M. Schultze, the Dean
of Admission, offered the students
as candidates for admission to Pres-
ident Collins, who accepted their:
formally into the University.

President Collins also explained
the significance of the torch and
candles used. The ceremony sym-
bolizes the continuation ofthe"llght
of learning" and the “procession of
knowledge" from high school to col-
lege.

Ari Johnston, Presidentol‘ Student
Association, then welcomed the
freshmen and directed them to don
their beanles. Joilnsonpresentedthe
while ailri gold class banner to the

Wolner made it clear to the fresh
that they were to wear their beanies

Sundays and in their residence halls.
They accepted their fate with the
usual groans and complaints of tight
fit and ruinaiien of bouffant hair-
dos.

Johnston congratulated ihe class
on the number of scholarship win-
ners, class presidents, editors of
newspapers and yearbooks among
the Yellow Jackets. He then closed

Statesmen, D&A, Mark

Over twenty campus organizations
were represented at the annual
Activities Day held Wednesday on
Dorm Field. From 2:00-4:00 p.m.,
and again from 7:00-9:00 p.m.,
members of each organization were
on hand to answer questions and
encourage students to join.

Both freshmen and upperclassmen
were offered activities to appeal to
any interest. Drama, music, pub-
lications, athletics and religious
groups were represented. Students
were able to indicate their pref-
erences, and will be contacted by
individual organizations.

During both sessions, special per-
formances were given by the Dre‘-
matics Council and by the States-
men, all-male cllorus.

Editor's Note: The following la
a statement from Eleanor Dioner
chairman of Activities Day.

"Those students who were able
to attend Activitle.r r)ay or: Wednes-
day should by now ,ealize that there
are vast opportunities in extra-
curricular aciiviiics open to all
students with varying interests and
abilities.

“And those students who were
unable to attend Activities Day
should realize the importance of

talking to upperclussmen, or read-
ing some of the numerous material
handed out to students about the
activities on campus.

  

Activities Day Wednesday

“At the present time, the enthu-
siasm displayed by the new joiners
is at a high level. In order for any
organization to function satisfac-
torily throughout the year, this en-
ihusiasm must stay at a high point.

“A club may be proud toannounce
that it has 100 members, but this
same club is not so proud to an-
nounce that it has only 25 workers..
Therefore, in order for an organi-
zation to run smoothly, it needs
enthusiastic workers.

“Any student who signs up to
help an organization should will-
ineg accept duties and responsi-
bilities that are assigned to him.
If a student does his job to the
best of his ability, and if he has
put enough effort into the job, it
will most probably trlrn out suc-
cessfully. Being responsible for a
“job well done” is a wonderful
feeling.

“Don’t become a joiner, but do
become a helper. Many Students
find that by helping some club and
by becoming part of a worthwhile
organization their stay at State is
more enjoyable. Why don’t you, the
Class of ’68 find out foryourself?'_'
