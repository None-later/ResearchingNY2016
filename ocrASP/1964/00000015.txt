in this issue. _

The. tournament was slated to be
a '72 hole medal play competition.
However, the final 18 holes of play
were suspended after they had been
rained out for two straight days.

Team Disappointed

State’s golfers had completed nine
holes of the final round when the
rain caused the postponement of
further play. Coach Richard Sauers
noted the team’s disappointment
when the tournament was halted
after 54 holes and those nine holes
discounted: “The team was having
its best round; Maurer had a 34,
Bayus 36, Morgan 39, and Rosen 39.

“We had an excellent chance to
improve our standing had the rain
not caused the cancellation oi the
final 18 holes,” Sauers said. The
team's three-round total was 945.
Southern Illinois University took
first place honors with 886.

Bayus turned in rounds of 75, 80
and ’79 for a 234 total. Morgan shot
a 236 with rounds oi 82, '75, and 79.
Rosen had rounds oi 8'7, 80, and 82
for a 249 total.

Twenty-Seven School: Entered

Altogether there were 27 schools,
representing 13 states, competing
in the tournament. Thirteen schools
entered full iour man teams. South-
west Missouri State College was the
host school.

Evaluating the team’s perform-
ance, Sauers said that he was very
proud of its showing in the tourna-
ment and the overall season record.
He praised the tournament’s organ-
ization. “lt was a very well-run
affair," he said. Sauers added, “this
tournament was probably the great-
est experience oi this four’s golf-
ing careers."

Former Ped Wrestling Champion
Places Third in Olympic Trials

Former Albany State wrestling star, Clem Crow ’62,
barely missed gaining a place on the 1964 United States
Olympic Team when he finished third in the Olympic
trials held August 27-28 at the World’s Fair. Only the
first two men in each weight class qualified for the
Olympics, which will be held in Japan next month.

The lyniie line on Sports

If one was to approach soccer coach Joe Garcia in
the closing seconds of a game in which his team held
an 8-0 lead and ask him what his team’s chances were,
he would be apt to say: “I think we have a fair chance
of pulling this game out.” Thus, our enthusiasm about
the booter's prospects for the impending season was
not dulled when Coach Garcia said that it’s too early
to tell about the team's chances.

We feel that the soccer team is vastly improved
'over last season. First of all, the large turnout of
players has created a situation where there is great
competition for starting positions. Last year. with

pound weight class, Crow
was pitted against out-
standing competition; the
x ,. two men who finished ahead

 " of him are both former,
NCAA champions.

Crow, who compiled anundefeated
dual meet record in 1961 en route
to capturing the 4-1 Tournament
championship in the lilo-pound
weight class, was under a disad-
vantage in the trials because Olym-
pic style is Greco-Roman with which
he has had limited experience.

In Grace-Roman wrestling the
contestants are not permitted to
use their legs or touch the other
man‘s legs, whereas in American
wrestling there are no such limi-
tations.

only sixteen men out, the hustle and desire of the
players left much to be desired. Team depth will be
another strong point; Garcia will be able to turn to
his bench for strong replacements, something he

could not do last year.

Maurice Tsododo and Dick Szymanski, up from the
fresh team, are valuable additions. Len Bergen and
Szymanski have worked very well at fullback and
Garcia, who last year was forced to play only a four-
man offensive line, in order to have three fullbacks,

will probably be able to play a five—man line this

Clem Crow

Crow is teaching math at Suwan-

He is assisting the wrestling coach
he cannot be paid to coach
wrestling because he would then
lose his amateur status. He has
been wrestling for the New York
Athletic Club for the past few years.

MAURICE TSODODO makes nifty

-\ lu‘ (tbs.

Coach Joseph Garcia ex-
pects the team to improve
open last season’s 3-7 rec-
ord. The experience of "the
veterans combined with the
team’s added depth should
be the keys to its improve-
ment.

Maurice Tsododo, the leading
scorer for the freshman team last
year, has been very impressive in
the early workouts. Offensive vet-
erans are Udo Guddat, Joe Pro-
copio, Ed Wolner, and Ospina.

Rowe and Bergen Important

Rawe, an All-State selection last
season, and Len Bergen appear to
'be the strongest defensemen. Rawe
will probably hold down one oi the
halfback slots. Bergen will most
likely play fullback.

Dick Szymanski, winner of the
freshman athlete of the year award
last year, has displayed consider-
able talent at fullback in the team's
early practices. Other defensive
veterans are Larry Hurley, Anton
Salecker, Pete Schroeck,Tom Flan-
agan and Marty Miller.

ASP Begins Fund Campaign
For Support of Foster Child

Graciela Garcia, the foster child sponsored by the
Albany Student Press receives assistance in the form
of clothes, medical attention, food and cash for the
twelve in mm period beginning December 1963. She is

Qeing supported through the gifts of faculty and stu—

dents.

This your the ASP will
again sponsor n child
through the Foster Parents
Plan. As in the previous
drive, the ASP is counting
on support by the members
of the University.

During thc year many letters
have been received from Graciela
a usually thanking her “foster pur-
cnts" for their help in supplying
the otherwise unattainable neces—
sary items for her daily lite.

general lack of trained teachers,
make an opportunity lo go to school

FRIDAY. SEPTEMBER 25. 1964

enccs Senate Session Marked

To Encourage Political

“We’re looking forward to a very
profitable year," said Student Asso-
ciation President Arthur Johnston,
as he opened the fall session of the

academic buildings, to use the as-
sembly halls and quadrangle for
meetings and rallies, and to use
the facilities of the ditto and mimeo-

1964 Senate Wednesday night. Inre- igl'aph mom-

viewing the events of the past semes-
ter he remarked, “it was one of the
most financially responsible years
Student Association has seen.“

Among other announcements,
Johnston gave the schedule of hours
for extra study rooms in Draper
Hall. The four rooms will be open
until 10 p. m. Mondays through
Thursdays, and until 5 p. m. on
Fridays.

Rooms 137 and 149 will be open
from 8 a.m. when classes are not
meeting there. Room 141 will open
at 6 p.m. on Mondays, 6:15 p.m.
Tuesdays, and 4:30 p.m. Wednes-
days through Fridays. Room 146
will open at 3:30 p.m. Mondays,
6 p.m. Tuesdays, 4:30 p.m. Wed-
nesdays, and (i p.m. Thursdays and
Fridays.

Political Resolution
The major piece of formal busi-
ness was a resolution introduced
by Senator Gene Tobey, and passed
unanimously:
"Be it resolved that:

"This year 1904, being a year
of Presidential election, and in or-
der to acquaint students with the
candidates, it is proper that par-
tisan student ccnunltteesbe formed,

“It is understood that these
groups shall not be allowed to so-
licit or funds, require donations,
or c ry on as a group any finan-
cial business, and that they shall
be terminated on or by the fourth
of November, 1964.“

It was made clear that Senate
would not allow student groups con-
nected with the national political
parties to solicit or use campus
facilities as deSCi‘lbd above.

Replacement Elections

Also in regard to politics, it was
announced that replacement elec-
tions would have to be held for
three offices. The resignations of
Steven Curti, Miss Maureen Gla-
sheen, and James Constantino have
created vacancies in two Senate
seats and the Sophomore Vice Pres-
idency, respectively. No further ac-
tion was taken.

The winner inlast year’s replace-
ment election for a ’67 Senate seat,
Laui' Kur7. was sworn in.

New 5. A. Office

ters, Johnston announced that the

tations Commission, and Senator

Dippikill Trip

Although Johnston warned, “You
might have to walk the last five
miles," Senate agreed to make an
inspection trip to the student-owned
Camp Dippikill sometime in Colo-
her.

The meeting was then adjourned.

According to the scheduled build-
ing of the new campus dormitory
complexes by the Dormitory Author-
ity, the second complex is already
well under way.

It has been planned to have both
complexes finished within a short
time of each other to allow students
to make a more complete transition
to the new campus.

Prograll Report
A current progress report on
various aspects of the campus has
been given to Colonel Walter 'I‘is-

More optimism is directed to-
wards the second stage of the build-
ing plan. So far, the second group
of 6 units are to be ready next
September. These units comprise
three units of the Residence Quad-
rangle. The balance of the Dormi-
tory units are planned for use in
September of 1966.

As far as the first complex is
concerned, the men now living in
motels should be moved onto the
new campus by the middle of next
month. w ' i .

In those dorms soon to be used,
several rooms are completely fili-
ished. These include tiled floors,
drapes, and other detail trim. Two
more units housing 100 students
each are being cleaned up for use
by next semester.

Eight academic buildings are now
under construction and will be com-
pleted by September1905.1‘herehas
been a little ditlirullv in completion,
but the minim-tors hope to be on

Academic Schedule

The second set ol nondwnicbulld-
lugs is scheduled for completion by
September 1966.

All the unfinished work is cur-
rently fenced off from the parts
under construction.

A central Commissary is almost
completed. It is interesting in that
it contains an intricate system of
electric tracks to bring in the meat
and vegetables. There is a separate
department for meat, vegetables,
and fish. The commissary also con-
tains a bakery in which everything
but bread will be baked and dis-
tributed to the dining halls.

Unit Dining Hall:

Each group of four units, housing
approximately 600 students, will
contain its own dining facilities.

One parking lot is available for
1,200 cars. Another lot forthe same
number of cars will becompleted by
next September. That will be lo-
cated fairly near the dorms.

To alleviate the sand and dust
problem, top soil and white pine
trees will be set in along Washing. '
ton Avenue.
