Now in its third year. the program
is sponsored by the Campus Chris-
tian Council, although it is secular
in nature. Students work with small
groups of two or three children who
are in grades 3 toGand are referred
to the program by their principals.

Each group meets once a week
from 3:45 to 4:30 p.m. in the class-
rooms of the Temple BaptistChurch

at Teri Broeck Street and Clinton
Avenue. The Campus Christian
Council pays transportation costs
for the instructors.

Personal Attention

By giving each child as much in-
dividual attention as possible, the
students try to increase the read—
ing skill comprehension, and vo-
cabulary of the youngsters. They
teach them to “sound out" words
and pronounce strange letter com-
binations. In some cases they must
even teach the alphabet.

But the most important aspect of
the program, according to Miss
Susan Jones, one of the coordinators,
is the personal contact between pupil
and tutor. “State students give these
children, whose only world is the
slum streets of Albany, a direct
contact with another world that is
unknown .to them," she said.

Another World
She also pointed out that the State
student would have a chance to
“learn about a world from which
we have been cut off, or at least
avoided.”

Any students interested in par-
ticipating in this project are asked
to contact Miss Jones in Alden Hall,
Miss Claudia George in Pierce Hall,
or Mr. Frank Snow at 501 State
Street, Albany.

water, there are active Golriwuu-r
groups at R.P.l., Union, and Siena
colleges. "l‘ve been having trouble
finding someone to lead the Cold»
water support on this (-ampus,
though,” he said.

Goldwater speaks just six days
after Robert Kennedy addressed u
cheering crowd in his bid for Ilw
United States Senate seat from No“
York.

“Is anybody here going to non
for Goldwater?” Kennedy asked. The
answer was a thunderous “Nu!”

Many State students were in this
crowd which applauded every unti—
Goldwater statement made by Ken—
nedy.

One freshman near the front held
up a sign reading, “We’re with you,
Bobby---SUNYA.”

Another irosh, more academically
oriented, was observed taking notes
for a speech class.

Senator Barry M. Goldwater of
Arizona, Republican presidential
nominee, will speak in Albany today
at 12 noon from the steps of the
State Office Building. He will be
accompanied by Mrs. Goldwater.

Goldwater, whose statements in
recent weeks have aroused much
controversy, is making the—Albany
stop in his nationwide campaign to
defeat President Lyndon Johnson at
the polls in November.

New York State Governor Nelson
Rockefeller will make the intro-
ductory remarks. Rockefeller’s
campaign activities have almost
ceased since his defeat by Gold—
water in the GOP primary in Cali—
fornia last spring.

0n hand to greet Goldwater will
be many students from area col-
lleges. Several women from Albany
State have volunteered to serve as
usherettes for the occasion.

Press Association Awards
ASP First Class Rating

The Albany Student
Press was awarded a First
Class Honor Rating for
spring semester 1964 in
recent Associated Colleg-
iate Press competition.

The ACP annually judges over
600 college newspapers in a com-
parison test to each other. About
10% of the newspapers in the com-
petition are given a First Class
Rating.

The next and highest category,
All-American, is reserved for about
the top 2% of the newspapers judged.

Comparison

The rating a paper receives is
‘ " ‘ to show how it compares
with other papers being produced
in .coileges of similar size. Scores
cannot be compared from year to
year.

They are intended to show only

how a newspaper stands relatively
to other papers during a given
semester.

The ASP has received First Class
ratings for the past two semesters.
Prior to the past year, it had
reached this mark only once in the
past ten years.

In the future, however, the ASP
will face much tougher competition
in the ACP Ratings. Being a semi-
weekly publication will place the
ASP in the select group of fifty col-
leges who also publish twice weekly
newspapers.

Major universities, such as the
University of Pittsburgh, are in this
classification.

Three Considerations

The ACP rates the newspapers
in the competition on the basis of
coverage, content, and physical
properties. All of the sections of
the ASP rated either very good or
excellent in each of the categories
judged.

Balance, style, the editorialpage,
the front page, and the interior
news pages received the highest
praise from the judges.

Copyreading, the masthead, and
typography were considered the
weakest sections of the newspaper.

William Colgan and Edith Hardy
served as Co-Editors of the ASP
during the past semester.

News Board

Other members of News Board,
the paper's governing body, were
Managing Editor, Karen Keefer;
Sports Editor, Ronald Hamilton;
Arts Editor, Earl Schreiber; Asso-
ciate Editor, Jacqueline Adams;As-
sociate Editor, Linda McCioud; As-
sociate Editor, Deborah Friedman;
Associate Feature Editor, Cynthia
