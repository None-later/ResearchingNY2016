generally agreed that 'every student needs a

the increased enrollment of this university. Especially

lend itself to an increase in Union space?

If one is lucky enough to find SRO during the
evening it is certainly impossible to find a seat, or
even be waited on in a matter of minutes.

The problem of a necessarily larger Union should
be regarded now, even though it be a “temporary”
one.

It is not too inconceivable that parts of Bru Lower
Lounge, or small rooms off the Union could be
stocked with chairs and tables to siphon off the
immediate overload of students.

Mission Accomplished?

We as we are sure all decent men were’ are
'appalled at the tragic murders of the three Civil
Rigits workers in Mississippi this summer. The
crime was a stain on the honor of the United States,
as well as that of Mississippi.

But we also feel that those three young men had
no business being where they were at the time they
were there. '

We feel that the organizers of the Mississippi pro-
.ject_ were in redibly’stupid in sending three-unarmed
youths unpro cted into a red-hot segregationist area
such as Philadelphia, Mississippi.

We do not understand the reasoning behind the
move of sending them there in the first place. The.
country around Philadelphia abounds in ignorance,
poverty, and race hatred. Such a land breeds men
whd can kill easily, without sense or reason.

What two white New Yorkers and one Negro could
hope to accomplish in the “investigation” of a church
burning in a region such as this escapes us. They
exposed themselves recklessly on an ill-conceived
mission.

For men who are to Mississippians “Nigger Lov-
ers” and a "Nigger" there could be no law protection
in Philadelphia. They were completely on their own
with no resources to ensure their lives.

We can only hope that a lesson has been learned
from this tragedy. High ideals are fine; but without
reason they are fatal. The Civil Rightists must use
common sense when dealing with places like Phil-

Albanians were treated last Saturday
to a spectacle much like that caused by
the Beatles coming to town. It was not
the Beatles, however. that occasioned a
pushing, screaming, hero~worshipping
crowd. It was the Democratic candidate
for the United States Senate seat from
New York, Robert F. Kennedy.

The hysteria surrounding Kennedy’s
visit seems to us another outgrowth of
the shame and shock caused by his
brother’s assassination last November.
John Kennedy himself never drew this
this type of emotional reaction, and in-
deed was bitterly opposed by many up
to the day of his death.

Since then, however, people have been
reluctant to say anything againstKennedy
the President, or Kennedy the family.
Many have even voiced their feeling that
they owe a “debt” to the Kennedy family
and to erase or at least make up for the
tragedy of the assassination, they should
elect Robert Kennedy to whatever office
he seeks.

Right now Robert Kennedy seeks the
Senate seat from New York, a state to
which he has only recently moved. Al—
though he speaks loftily of what “the
people of New York want,” and of “our
state’s needs." it is obvious that he is
merely using the state as a stepping

He is also not in the least atlvcrse to \
capitalizing on his brother’s name and ,
t
fame. One of his favorite teCIllllqllOS is
to give a perfect mimicry oi the late
John Kennedy’s voice, a tactic which
never fails to draw hysterical cheers
from the idol-worshippers.

Almost as disturbing as Kirnncdy’s
tactics is the reaction of those New
Yorkers who somehow feel that they
must sacrifice the welfare of this great
state to a memory. Robert Kennedy,
despite his efforts, could only he an

TASTE and POCKElBillIII

Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after the
Regents’ sakes. We are speaking of those poor un-
fortunate souls that tradcd a place in the registra-
tion line for a place in the bread lines.

Shortly before the semester began the students
of this illustrious University received a letter from
the business offfice urging them to “avoid lines for
defering payments, by paying cash for the fees" and
using the Regents Scholarships for their living ex-
penses.

We would like to point out one small flaw in ad-
ministrative suggestion. Last year the first semester
Regents Scholarship checks were available to the
student at a most convenient March 5. The average
student's funds' for living expenses do not cover such
extended periods of time. ‘

Since everything else at Albany State is two or-
threc months behind schedule. we have no reason to
have any faith in the business office.

We sincerely hope that the situation we foresee “""m'"
shall never come about, but somehow we cannot
erase the picture of students looking for handouts on
the steps of Draper. t

§luie Student’s Summer Focuses on

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

. Devotes 5 ‘Quiet’ Weeks to Work
On Mississippi Freedom Project

.I

by Cynthia Goodman

“I thought 1 could be of as much
help as anybody else," says Lola
Johnson when asked why she chose
to join the Mississippi Freedom
Project this summer.

For five weeks, beginningin June,
Miss Johnso‘n took part in one of
the largest and most daring pro-
grams initiaied by the Council of
Federated Organizations.

The Council is a combination of
SNCC (Student Non-Violence Co—
ordinating Committee) CORE,
NAACP and the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference.

Proiect Oiiontotlon

The first step for the Mississippi
volunteers was an Orientation meet-
ing at Tougalo College. In a brief
weekend, the leaders of the Preject
tried to familiarize the students
with the phases of the Mississippi
Project.

The entire drive centered around
three areas of endeavor: the voter
registration problem Was, natur-
ally, ioremost on the list. Also in-
cluded were the freedom schools.
This phase of the Project in some
ways resembled emergency sum-
mer schools.

The final phase of the Project
was the development and mainten-
ance of centers in local commun-
ities. Miss Johnson explained that

opportunities for recreation lnMisi
sissippf are almost non-existent
except for segregated movie houses.

The purpose of the community
center was to provide recreation
facilities for the people of Miss-
lsslppi.

ln Batesvllle, Mississippi, Miss
Johnson’s home base, the center
provided modern dance classes for
high school students, art classes
and literacy classes, which were
relatively unsuccessful.

Security tor Protection

One phase of the Orientation pro-
gram at Tougalo included a run-
down of security measures that
would be in operation to protect the
volunteers.

it was necessary, said Miss John-
son, to let people know at all times
where you were, when you were
coming back and when you actually
arrived. in order to keep incidents
down to a minimum, students were
urged not to drive at night, and not
to ride in interracial cars if pos-
sible.

Even with the precautions, how-
ever, ihere were incidents. There
were reports of volunteers or local
Council workers being tear-gassed
or shot at.

Once, while she was gathering in-
formation at the Courthouse (at the
request of the Justice Department)
concerning voter registration pro-

Cooperation rom e sgro -
muniiy itself was varied. The Ne-

groes who owned property of their

own were generally eager to be of
assistance. Those who lived on plan-
tations were reluctant to risk being
evicted from their homes by furious
white landlords.

When asked about Baiesville, Miss
Johnson explained that there were
actually two towns inone. The Negro
and Whitr communities were so
different that there seemed to exist
an almost physical dividing line
between them.

On one side of the line were the
Well-lighted, black-topped streets
lined by concrete sidewalks. 0n
the other side of the line were the
dark dirt roads of the Negro sec-
tion.

It's So Dittoront

Although she and her group trav-
eled throughout Panoia County dur-
ing the summer, she refused to
draw any relationship between
Baiesvilie and the rest of the state.
“it’s so different there," she ex-
plained, “it's impossible to use a
term like ‘average.’ "

Now that it’s all over, Miss John-
son has no regrets. “There's a
[job to be done there and it can
only be done with outside help.
Mississippi just doesn't have the
manpower and leadership to do it
alone.”

Despite the lurking dangers, the
problems and disillusion, Miss
John can say: “It’s been a rela-
tively quiet summer.”

Note:

Last summer the Campus Chris-
tian Council raised funds for the
Mississippi Summer Project and at
the some ihne collected and sent 50
boxes of hooks in he used in Free-
dom Schools.

l’ari Ur the fund—raising campaign
was directed for use Ily Miss John-
son for her summer work in Miss-
issippi.

Tuesday evening, September iii)
in iiruhat'her Miss Johnson will
speak on Her experiences as a
climax to the Council project.

At the same Inccting discussion
will he conducted concerning the
formation of a new Civil liights
Movctueni on State's campus. The
group will set up a schedule of
lectures on tho topic of civil rights.
