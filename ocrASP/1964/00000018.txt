A SOLEMN CALMNESS settles over the motel at night once the students are secure in their room. Only

the lonely footsteps of the armed

guards can be heard.

State Students Invade Motels

Normal College life Prevails . 1.

by Eileen Manning and Debby Friedman

Students returning to Albany State
familiarize themselves with the doll
The “lucky” students living at the
a few days, but those others,
meeting new situations which

by most individuals.

The administration has
done much to provide these
students with the general
atmosphere of college life.

Although the motel rooms are not
large enough for five students and
thus necessitate the breaking up oi
the quintuplets, students are room-
ing with at least one of their orig-
inal roommates. The other room-
mates are usually close by.

This proximity of your friends
proves to be heart-warming when
you are lockcd lll your rooui after
11 p.m.

Lilo Betaro Curfew

Beiore confinement at eleven,
however, dormitory life in the mo-
icls is somewhat tho same as at
the roguiar dormitories.

Many motels have even provided
study and date lounges ior tlioso
weary travniors who have come out
to visit their friends. ’l‘hoseloungos
arc merely converted nioth rooms
and from the outside resemble the
other rooms.

Make the wrong turn and, well -
it some Statesman don’t find the
date lounge forthwith, several girls
in adjoining rooms will be forced
to join the Better Business Bureau.

of course, those red-orange lights
at tho Thruway Motor [on don't liolp

it was noted that at one outpost a
group oi coeds advertised on their
door, "Men Wanted. No Experience
Necessary." The response was
overwhelming.

Social life can't be that had at the
motels, after all, there are busos
running to Draper llaii all weekend.
Some follows who live at tho Coun-
try Squire may iind it inconvenient
to meet their dates who live at the
Town House, but this is easily
remedied by the “rapid transit"
system.

A romantic rendoz-vouo on the
buck steps of Draper Hall is the
result.

Contrary to it rumor circulating

around the campus that students
could get back into the motels only
it they arrived by bus, it is now
certain that girls may be driven
back to their motels by their dates.

This may take the men three
miles out of their way, but it is
certainly better than saying "good
night" at a bus stop thirty minutes
before hours.

Free Tours of Albany

Tile upperclassmen, deprived of
a two-hour tour of Albany which the
freshmen receiver] during summer
orientation, should be especially
grateful for the tours they are now
receiving -- two or three times a
day at that!

Some students have (‘illllplilllleil
about the exceedingly uncomfortable
rides on the buses, so after a
thorough investigation, it was dis-
covered that ii Is not the “well-
paved ’ Albain roads at fault.

tioii Company is tobliimc. Tliobusos
are now equipped with square \vheols
instead of the conventional round
ones. It must be true -— everyone
has n “distinct” feeling when they
rotiirli from meals via these con-
voyanccs.

Meal Marathon
The meals are especially good,
but after riding on a bits for forty
minutes and then wnitiiig on ailno
for a half hour, some students may

taint from hunger or exhaustion.

After finally devouring the dinner
and getting drunk on root beer, the
students have the distinct honor of
bringing their trays into the"clean,
well-maintained” dishwashing room
where they neatly stack the dishes.

Dress at meals is the same as at
other dorms, but sweat shirts and
jeans would be more appropriate for
this task.

Life in the motels Is not all stigiii
and honey as it may sound, for their
are a few minor difficulties. ’I‘ho
motels have no facilities for laimdi '.
or ironing so students must iinpiw
