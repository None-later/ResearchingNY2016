 ‘ Every school in the United States.
I  whether it be of the prestigious Ivy
 League or of the newer, mass educa-

tion colleges, has its own particular
kind of student. and each of these kinds
{of students has his own particular look.
his own particular Way of dressing.
 For example, a Harvard man would
not wear the same type of suit as a
Yale man. and a Vassar girl would not
wear the same type of dress or the
some hairstyle as a Radcliffe girl.

Each school has its own distinct type
of student and its own distinct way of
(dressing. And the same is of course
true here at, uh, Albany State.
“' The big thing in fall fashions at State
this year seems to again be the white
Levis, which look especially dashing
iffer they are washed several times and
shrunk so that they come about ten
inches above the ankle.
‘ They give the student. boy or girl
(girls wear them too), that much sought
after "poured in" look. (Do you know
the difference between boy's Levis and
girl’s?)

The latest rage, however, seems tobe

in socks. This new fashion trend is easy
for students both rich and poor to fol-
low because it is simply a matter of not
wearing any. If you want to be really
“in” this year. just throw away all your
socks and wear only your shoes.

Also big this year is BleedingMadras.
This looks very collegiate and can be
made into a shirt for boys or a dress
for girls. Madras, however, can have
its drawbacks too, especially if one
gets caught in the rain.

(We had a girl here who mreaBleed-
ing Madras dress, and while hitchhiking
back to her motel, it began to rain so
that when she got to her room and took
off her dress. she had colored under-
wear.)

Beards are still quite stylish. For
those of you who want tobelthe utmost
in nonconformity, just grow a beard,
get a pair of old worn dungarees, a
book on Zen Budhism, and go sit in the
Cave and smoke Camel Cigarettes (they
make you die faster).

These are just a few fashion tips that
might be useful for those of you who
want to be among that distinct group
which makes the State student different
from the Harvard or Yale student.

 

 

 

Baldwin Launches Sharp Inditement

‘ by Kathy Brophy

:Jsmes Baldwin’s essays, col-
lected under the title “The Fire
Next Time," are a logical choice
fbr the suggested reading list for
freshman.

Baldwin discusses his experi-
ences in relation to what may be
lposely be called the Negro prob-
lem. or, more popular still, civil
rights. And, on campus this year
civil rights is “In.” It is “cool”
to be at least informed upon, it
not in favor of. the civil rights
movement.

Social Implications

The social implications rather
than the literary qualities of the
essays are my topic. The casual
statement “civil rights isIn" masks
some of the smug assumptions that
Baldwin attacks. That a principle
as basic as the equality of man
must await fulfillment until it is
taken up as a Cause by the power
group — the Whites — is a severe
indictment of the White population.

Why, he asks, does the recog-
nition of the equality of the Negro
imply the raising of the Negro to
the White's level? Considering the
moral decadence of the white pop-
ulation, as evidence in their treat-
ment of the Negro, isn’t it just as
logical and perhaps more realistic
to think of the whiteslearnlng moral
strength from Negroes?

Not Black Supremacy
‘1

Do not be misled into thinking that
this admiration for the courage of
Negroes is Baldwin's way of cham-
pioning black supremacy. He is
deeply sympathetic to the suffer-
ings of Negroes. Buthenever lapses
into the polar equivalent of Senator
Byrd's attitude. Baldwin takes his
stand on the basis of the worth of

.each human being. While he cannot
think the Nation of Islam philosoph-
ically justified or economically
feasible, he can explain why the
group is powerful.

It is so because its accusations
of the whites are true. The method
of redress is unrealistic, but the
injustices are too real.

Existential Bias

At the same time that he can hold
this scrupulously honest View of the
absue of the Negroes, Baldwin can
understand the problem of white
liberals who maintain that Negroes
are not subhuman, in spite of the
sociological evidences of degrada-
ticn.

His most acute perceptions con-
cern the nature of the realities that

people construct for themselves.’

Here an existential bias is evident.
He displays a preference for the
here and now, the immediate con-
frontation of two human beings, and
conversely, a distaste for abstrac-
tions and rationalizations. He notes
the tendency of white liberals to
treat Negroes as causes not as men.
They do not see James Baldwin,
human being, but rather James Bald-
win, Negro, whose success we ap-
prove in theory.

Nobility cl Resilience

This same passion for the im-
mediate, the particular and the hu-
man makes Baldwin intensely sym-
pathetic to suffering, and he is able
.to communicate the nobility of
dogged resilience to his readers.

Nowhere does he indulgue in sen-
timentality. Considering that he
treats a topic charged with emotion,
this is an accomplishment. But clear
perceptions and precise diction con-
trol the propaganda values. It is the
achievement of his spirit and his
craft to throw a cold clear light
on his experiences.

For his insight he may be read
as an antidote to Martin Luther
King. Contrasting the great gentle-
ness in “Why We Can’t Wait," with
the revelation of the Negro view
of the white in “The Fire Next
Time," it becomes easier to see
why King is considered by Negroes
to have sold out to the white mod-
erates. If it is possible to read
Baldwin and not wish that he and
Reverend King were leading Negro
opinion and not exceptions to gen-
eral mistrust and bitterness, then
one must be insensitive to human
suffering, unconcerned about the
nearness of race riots in Rochester,
and unlikely to reach a fearless

Editor’s Note: The lollowlng article
is a general commentary on the
Presidential candidates. In the com-
ing weeks, I will present a series
of articles covering spacilic areas
at interest in the campaign and the
views at both candidates as they
themselves have expressed them.
' As in every political election,
it is almost impossible to see the
basic issues through the confusion.
Both candidates seem murderously
intent on obscuring the voters' vi-
sion with a cloud of insults, insinu-
ations and impossible recommenda-
tions.

Both Senator Goldwater and Pres-
ident Johnson have suggested subtly
and openly that election of the other
will bring immediate and inevitable
disaster. '

Each has painted pictures of un-
controllable violence, economic col-
lapse, complete annihilation of civ-
ilization and Social Security, and
wholesale misery.

Something Old, Nothing New

Actually, the Goldwater-Johnson
conflict is in many ways just a re-
hashing of issues that have been with
us for two decades and more.

States' rights vs. Federal control,
creeping socialism and excessive
centralization, automation and la-
bor, Sino-Russo-American rela-
tions, the alliance systems and world
defense, atomic control and domes-
tic and world economic stabilityare
all old issues.

Not even the unfortunate labeling
(or libeiing) of candidates into Con-
'servative and Liberal, Radical and
Moderate are new. Both men, as
adept professional politicians, know
the use and abuse oflabels. Because
of the expanse of a title like “Con-
servative," it can hide a greatdeal.

It can include isolationism, a
distrust of progress, rightist chau-
vinlsm, or simply distaste for reck-
lessness and extravagance in gov-
ernment.

The Dilloroncas
All this is not to say that the
choice in this election is non-exist-
ent or unimportant. Ignoring the
charges of "war-monger," “radi-
cal,” "phony," etc. some small

New Issues.

and criticized.

The question of control of nuclear
arms is still a major consideration.
Another difference between the two
platforms is the debate over the
Public Accommodations portion of
the 1964 Civil Rights Bill. The
wrangling over how much the 0.5.
should disarm sliouid concernevery
American.

- There are disturbing elements in
this election that should also be
recognized. First, the Republican
candidate has, willingly or unwill-
ingly, aligned himself with the Con-
servative Parties and their policy.

His stand on extremism has
changed repeatly in recent months
and is still uncertain.

He has taken a forceful and po-
litically dangerous stand against
ideas that have been long held sa-
cred, i.e. disarmament.

Further, Goldwater has been thus
far too much on the defensive. He
has been so busy convincing every-
one that he is not a ranting radical
that he has challenged Johnson’s
position in a relatively ineffective
way. As a result, he appears to be
“reaching” for issues.

The Democratic candidate, on the
other hand, has chosen to take the
comfortable road through the cam-
paign. He is taking advantage of his

position as President to influence
the decision of voters and has not
taken an active part in the cam:
palgn.

The Conventional Candidate

His stands on important issues
have been general and ‘safe.’ At
times he has limited answers to
legitimate Goldwater charges with
an attack on Goldwater's sanity
or sobriety.

Perhaps most disturbing, he is
consciously dramatizing his role
as successor to a slain president.

While Goldwater has hardly been
“Conservative” in his comments
about Johnson, the President in
turn, has chosen to misconstrue
and misrepresent Goldwater’s po-
sition on foreign affairs and world
peace.

The important tests of both Sen-
ator Goldwater and President John-
son will come in the month remain-
ing to the campaign. For most
Americans, the decision will be

Huckleberry Road

 

 

by Timothy Atwoll

After we got off the Thruway, Tommy and I (Tom-
my is my friend, and he comes first because he was
driving) circled the new campi in his Predatory Red
’57 Ford and kept bumping into eight-foot-high bar-
ricades.

I was greatly disturbed by this, because i had
expected to live on the other side of all that orange
iridescence, but Tommy took it all in stride and
said he didn‘t mind that I didn’t know what the heck
I was doing, we were still friends. Which was
comforting since, not five minutes previous, we
had fougiit over who pay the Thruway toll. Tommy
insisted I pay. I refused. We settled it by diuwlng
blood. I lost. (About half a pint) So we laughed and
laughed to think we were still friends, and then we
looked for a phone and I called Housing.

it seems that some of the letters informing those
who were to live at the new campus that they wouldn’t
be living there were sent out third-class mail. That
just may mean no stamp. Perhaps no address, I don’t
know. Anyway, I was off to the Country Squire Motel,
which, I was told, “is out on Western, toward Sche—
nectady." It is toward Schenectady. If you're coming
from Amsterdam.

But there’s no sense griping about it, so forth-
with a few tips on living way out there in Eckwelt.

1. Learn where the library is and stay there all
day until suppertime and then take a bus to the State
Offices Cafeteria, then back to the library and then
go home on the ten o’clock bus. I strictly forbid
anyone to try to do any sort of work at his respec-
tive motel, except those who feel a compulsion to
brush after every blasted meal, who are free to
do as they pretty well please.

2. Learn how to read the bus schedule.

3. Get a copy of “The Bus Schedule as Lethal
Weapon to be Used on Bus Drivers Whose Watches
Keep inaccurate Time" Available at any cab stam
lion.

Now some tips on how to maintain your self-
respect in the face of derisive laughter.

1. Act like you're happy that you're living in a
motel.

“Where you staying?"

“Motel, man.”

"0h, Godl Hal Hal For how long?"

Begin to walk away.

“Six weeks."

Turn the nearest corner as you say,

“Longer i hope.”

2. Make friends envious.

“Where you living?"

“Motel in Schenectady."

"How is it out there?”

"Great. Got everything — swimming pool....”

Don’t Say another word, beacuse there’s nothing‘
else to brag about, and besides, once he hears
"pool" he’ll get so shook up he’ll never notice that
certain other key words, like "laundry room,"
"supper," and “desk” didn’t follow.

Also try:

“Where the hell you livin?”

“Schenectady Motel."

Pause. Smile.

"Not a lamp-post within three miles 'of the place."

3. There’s always the economics angle.

“You living in i1 motel in Schenectady?"

“Yeah.”

“Cost any more?" ,

"No. Saving money all the time. Found a Bible in
the drawer. Need it for a course. Those things cost
a fortune you know, a good one. Lucky break."

4. Make the distance and traffic desirable.

"You living in Waterbury?"

“No. Motel in Schenectady. Great chance to really
run my Italian racing cycle. Eighteen speeds. Ninety
miles an hour. (Ever notice how it's always ninety
miles an hour?) Now I can practice up for the annual
Last Shopping Day Before Christmas Four-Man Shuttle
Race along Fifth Avenue from 34th to 59th. Lucky
break."

i keep getting the feeling that I’m going to be right
there when the pool freezes over. Somebody is busy
nurturing residence“ loyalty among motel inhabitants.

One of the' signal events in the
recent past was the opening of the
World’s Fair. This sdultplayground
has been criticized on many, often
just, counts.

But the motion pictures provided
at many of the exhibits show a
variety and ingenuity that far sur-
passes anything shown on the com-
mercial screens of the country.

"The Searching Eye" is one of
two films presented by Eastman
Kodak; it was made by Saul Bass,
known for his unusual designs for
the credits of a number of feature
films. We follow a young boy on a
beach, and see those things that
he sees. In addition, techniques
such as magnification and time-
lapse photography show much that
escapes the unaided eye.

Screen Expansion

The film starts with a fairly
small, square screen; when the
subject matter warrants, it expands
to a more substantial 70mm width.
At times, this large screen is sub-
divided into four or six sections,
each with a separate image.

Humorous, interesting and, above
all, beautifully photographed, this
picture represents some of the best
use to which a section of motion
picture film could be put. As such,
it is as fine a “commercial” as
Kodak could have provided.

“To the Moon and Beyond,”
sponsored by KLM Airlines, is al-
most as impressive, but instead
of small—screen beauty, this 860
degree Clnerama film emphasizes
size. The image is projected on an
overhead dome, and the audience
must tilt its many heads horizon-
tally for the picture to completely
fill the vision. Unfortunatelv. the

0, Brave New College

by Robert Judd

O, Brave New College

When things go from good to had,
almost everyone takes notice; but
when things go from bad to worse,
hardly anyone takes notice. Not
Very many people have noticed Al—
bany State’s direction. But recent
trends are only a forecast of the
hazards planned for future students.

To take one example (one over-
worked, bui obviously not over-
worked enough, example) student
initiative, or rather (for the nega-
tive is the rule, not the exception
at State) the lack of student initia-
tive. Apathy is rampant on campus,
and, if possible, it will get worse;
for the unique, the different, and
the indivniuai are encouraged little,
or not at all.

i had originally thought that stu-
dent aputhy was inherent Within the
students themselves, but this is not
so. if is the university system which
is attempting (and successfully, one
might add) to make the student body
muloi'm llliu a sheepisb, docile, and
pliant mass.

A Wol lore State

This hm; been most apparent re—
cently in the area of Dormitory
living. The student is being mode
to depend upon the college for his
residence. By revoking the right of
students to live in apartments or
Greek houses, the administration

has turned the college into a vir-
tual welfare state.

And when ine move to the new
campus is completed, the student
will depend upon ilie college not
only for his room and food, but also
for his entertainment, his social
life, his economic, medical and in-
tellectual needs. Students will buy
(and be bought) on the new campus.

Houses and apartments reﬂect
the personalities of their owners,
and I know of nothing more cold,
sterile, and heartless than a dor-
mitory. Student apartments and
Greek houses should not only be
allowad, but encourage, to flourish.
Or perhaps mandatory faculty and
administrative dorms should be
built.

Vegetables and Minds

But then, many, if not most, stu—
dents want this collegiate brave
new world. The security of a dorm
room easily overrides the stipula-
tion that you must live there. Dorm
counciloi's have evolved into "big-
bi'olhers.“ (A more suitable term
might be "siep-fathers.")

"Equality, Dependency, Commun-
ity" is the shout of the iabble of
the future. Students are being con-
ditioned to fawn upon the "adult"
world, while they should be being
taught how to live as adults.

One shot, a satellite descending,
into his lap, makes the viewer
squirm, and a number 'of other
scenes are almost as impressive.
But the best effects are obtained
when he camera looks in the same
directhn as the viewer - upward.

T. script suffers from stielnpb-
ing to cover most fields of science
in in minutes; it is at the very
least disordered. ‘Also, unfortunate-
ly, Lowell Thomas narrates.

Distractlng Voyage

The U. S. pavillton provides a
unique ride-cum-movie. This"Voy-
age through History" moves viewers
on bleachers, through anever-qulte-
dark-enough tunnel cluttered with
over 200 separate screens. Timed
with the narrator's voice, vario 5
pictures ﬂash on the screens ‘6
illustrate the pseudo-poetic nar-
ration by Ray Bradbury. Most of
the pictures are still, and some
even fail to fit their screens. '

Even without poor planning (often
the bleacher ahead can be seein
rounding a corner, with those il-
luminated screens providing an un-
expected preview .of things to come),
this sort of presentation seems im-
practical. Too many screens de-
mand attention, while too little time
is provided to indulge it.

“Parable” is a very professional
film at the Protestant and Orthodox
Paviliion which sets the story of
Christ in a stylized circus. While
its symbolism often requires much
background‘ to identify, it stimu-
lates discussion and is a very mQy

ing experience. y
Illustrated Sermon

Billy Graham presents a film in
Todd-A0. Called “Man in the
Fifth Dimension,” it features Mr.
Graham, and is really an illus-
trated sermon. In intent, it differs
considerably from "Parable," yet
each is well-made and in the long
run successful. "

There are many other films at
Flushing Meadows, but even this
sample shows that the major enl-
phasis is on radical and original
projection and filming techniques.

While the content and narration
are often weak, the films are still
recommended as an excitingiy un—
usual visual experience. Experi-
ments of this sort haven’t been
carried out in such quantity since
Hector was a pup.

Negatively conditioned and re-
stricted environments breed stunted
vegetables and minds. At Albany it
is difficult to separate the vegetables
from the minds.

Academically l have prospered a
great deal at Albany State. It is a
highly respected, very competent
school, and I have learned much in
its classrooms. But in a larger
sense, and in many ways a more
important sense, i have profited
from living in the city of Albany,
from shopping, socializing, and
learning outside of the closed col-
lege community. Students now and in
future years will not have the oppor-
tunities, the freedoms I had to grow
up and develop outside of college.
It seems strange to think that chil-
dren can turn into adults in the
second it takes to hand them a
diploma.

Albany is a fine school, and it
turns out brilliant students. Up-
foriunaleiy if fails to turn out bril-
liant people.
