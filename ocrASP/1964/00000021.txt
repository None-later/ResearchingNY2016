Opening «the season to- ~

"mor‘row against Brooklyn
Gallege 2 p.m. atWashing-
ton Park. the cross-coun-
try team has four return-
lllﬂ, Veterans plus six new

faces on the sﬁuad.

John Clark, Ken , irik, Tom Rob-
inson ind beards Tattle are the four
letterrnen who will term thenucleus
of the team. These four men were
members of last year's team which
was undefeated in dual meet compe-
tition.

One of the reasons for the Har-
riers success was Robinson. He won
every dual meet and set a new rec-
ord at the LeMoyne Invitational.
Coach Keith Munsey says that Rob-
inson is in as good as shape this
year and should continue to be the
Feds' number one man.

Newcomers Give Depth

Ken Darmer, Jake Johnville and
Bob Novack each ran on the trash
squad last year, and along with
Fred Barker and transfers Ed Brown
and Bob Flick will give the team
greater depth.

Coach Munsey rates Flick’s and
Darmer’s performances in practice
outstanding and both should be able
boost to the team.

In tomorrow’s meetthe Peds will
be without the services of Kirik who
is recuperating from an operation.
Coach Munsey calls Brooklyn one of
the strongest opponents the Feds
will face and the absence of Klrik
could be a decisive factor on the
outcome of the meet.

Team Much Improved

Coach Munsey said “this year's
team is much improved over last
year‘s and the first five men should
be stronger time wiso.”

The team this year has some
formidable opponents in New Haven
State, Montclair State and RH. Each
of these teams promise to give the
Pads strong competition in their
run for their second consecutive
undefeated season.

“This year’s frosh cross-country

as the key to this year’s team’s
strength.

Coach Munsey is especially op-
timistic about the prospects ofGrant
Downes, Frank Burg, Joe Kcniing,
Bob Mulvey, and Kevin Mogen. The
coach‘s optimism stems from the
fast times recorded by these five
in practice.

These five may comprise the

next Tuesday, September 29, against

new campus, are not yet open.
Therefore, the tennis club has been
forced to use the Washington Park
courts.

Despite the practicing difficulty
it has encountered, the Women's
Tennis Club is entering two singles
teams and one doubles team in the
Eastern intercollegiate Tennis
Tournament at Forest Hills, October

About 65 colleges from all parts
of the United States will participate

Starting Positions Undecided

“I'll choose Saturday’s starters

in the two exhibitions,” Garcia said.
The coach declined to predict the
team’s chances for the season, but
he did assert, “We definitely have
more possibilities team-wise than
we’ve had in years."

There are two main candidates
competing for the vital goalie posi-
tion; Ron Hamilton and Malcolm
Provost have both performed well
in practice. Provost played goalie

a senior, has never been out for

The lynne line on Sports

by Harold Lynne

Soccer is the nearest thing to u universal sport;
all over the world enthusiastic, often overﬂowing,
crowds attend professional, college, and oven grade-
school soccer games. However, this exciting, fast-
moving sport has never had great appeal to tho Amer—

ican public.

Being more specific, Albany State students have
never given its soccer team the support that it do-
servos. It certainly isn’t a result of apathy towards
athletics; State basketball and baseball games are
always attended by good crowds.

We feel that the reason for State students’ failure
to actively support their soccer team stcums from
their luck of understanding of the game. To people

unfamiliar with soccer,

the game appears to lack

unity, because the ball passes from one team in the

other without apparent

progress for either side.

If the spectator would look for offensive patterns,
such as the give-and-go, and defensive teamwork which
are so much a part of soccer, we are sure that n
greater appreciation of the game and an increase In

enthusiasm would result.

The soccer team opens its season tomorrow at
2 p.m. on Vet’s Field. Conch Garcia has indicated
that he would like to see his players more confident.
A large partisan home crowd woulddo much to bolster

the booters’ confidence.

Prognostication Dept.
We picked the Yankees to win the pennant in the
American League and they have taken a commanding
lead in the league standings; therefore we're pre~

dieting that another New

York team, the Giants, can

start winning and still capture the Eastern Division
Championship. Gary Wood will throw three touch
down passes to lead the Giants to victory over the

Washington Redskins.

Goldwater Gets, Support from Youth,
Dubious Praise from Rockefeller

A GROUP OF STATE'S "Belles for Barry'; leads a spirited
rendition of a Goldwater campaign song.

"Win. the youth, and you
win the nation” charac-
terized the rally, if not
the speech, of Republican
Presidential candidate
Barry M. Goldwater Fri--
day. Goldwater spoke
briefly from the steps of
the Alfred E. Smith bui1d~
ing at 12:30 p.m.

One of the obvious evidences of
the Goldwater campaign for youth
was the more than forty Goldwater
girls who circulated through the
crowd with campaign material and
led songs and cheers for the Sena-
tor. Thirteen Albany State women
were among the “Belles for Bar-
,.y_u

An estimated 5,000 people were
on hand to greet the Arlzonan, who
arrived about thirty minutes late.
Many in the crowd were state work-

Athletic Board Recommends Hiring
0f Phsicians for Home Games

0 A decision to recommend

the securing of doctors at
State home athletic con—
tests highlightcd the first
Athletic Advisory Board
meeting of the year last
Friday.

The Board voted unanimously to
recommend to Dr. Evan R. Collins,
President of Ihe University, that
the sum of $1200 be taken from
Reserve Funds to hire a pool of
doctors at all home soccer, buse-
ball, wrestling and basketball
games.

Moral Responsibility

in the words of Merlin Hathaway,

“Athletic Director at State, it was a

matter of meeting a “dofinilcmoral

responsibility rather than a strictly
legal one."

Hathaway pointed out that the

dangers of head injuries, especially

in the so—called contact sports,
warranted the hiring of this pool
of doctors.

Dr. John Glockner will head this
group of fully-licensed physicians.
The group will be paid on a game
basis, with a rate of approximatey
$10 an hour serving as the base.

New Chairman

Michael Governanti was chosen
to serve as Chairman of the Board
for the coming Academic year. Gov-
ernanii, a Junior, has been a mem-
ber of the Board since his fresh-
men year.

Marium Tashjlan will serve as
Secretary of the Board. She will be
responsible for maintaining tight
communications with President Col-
lins in all the Board‘s actions.

The Board also recommended that
$400 he removed from the Reserve
Funds for the purchase of two type-
writers for the Athletic Department.

Rockefeller to campaign

New York State Governor Nelson
A. Rockefeller made the introduc-
tory remarks. Relatively inactive
politically since his defeat by Gold-
water in the California primaries,
he is now starting a statewide carri-
paign in support of the GOP can-
didate.

"Although we have fundamental
differences on basic issues," he
said, “i can admire the Senator
for what he has done.” Rockefeller
commented on Goldwater's parser-
verance and determination in the
face of overwhelming odds and
laughed, “I should know.”

in "introducing" the crowd to
Goldwater, Rockefeller remarked,
“Confidentlaily, Albany is a demo-
cratic oasis in a Republican licori-
land," but added, “New York Is the
second most Republican state in
the nation."

Democratic Support

Goldwater addressed his firstre-
mark to the “Democratic oasis.”
"if I had to depend on Republicans
alone I’d never get anyplace," he
said, "It's the Democrats who are
unhappy that elect me.”

Goldwater spoke in strong sup-
port of Senator Kenneth B. Keating,
calling him “the best thing that has
happened to New York in the Senate
in many and many a year.” He re-
ferred to Keatlng’s opponent, Rob-
ert F. Kennedy, as "Lyndon’s rc-
ject" and said that lhe trend today
secured to be "Vote forthe stranger
of your choice."

Secret Government
The Senator’s primary concern,
however, was with the Democratic
administration.
He accused President Johnson of
“protecting” Bobby Baker and pre-
dir'tcd that the administration would

VOL. L. No.21

try to "whitewash" the new Baker
case. He received loud cheers from
the crowd as he asserted, “The
government of our country was not
meant to be a secret affair.”

He called a “shocking omission”
Johnson’s failure to mention Com-
munism in his acceptance speech.
“The only threat to peace is Corn-
munismi" said Goldwater.

Military Might at all Costs

He added that the United States
must maintain its military strength
and not be afraid to “remain strong
regardless of cost." '

He called for a return to the
states of power which he alleged
had been taken from them. He ac-
cused Johnson of assuming so much
power that “the Democrats don't
know whether to vote for him or
just plug him in.”

He also referred to Johnson'sllst
of fundamentals of American life:
prosperity, justice and peace,
charging, “He didn’t mention free-
dom. Without it all the others are
valueless."

Goldwater closed his speech with
a humorous reference to the rain
which blighted his appearance. Not-
ing that it broke adrought he laughed,
“Just remember, a Republican
brought it to you."

Mild Reaction

Although Goldwater signs and but-

tons were numerous, the crowd ex-
hibited only mild enthusiasm for the
Senator. it was a marked cdntrast
to the almost hysterical crowds
which greeted Robert Kennedy in
his appearance a little over a week
are.
E’l'cu members of the Albariychap-
tor of Core plrtketed the rally. James
Pryor, one of the marchers, ex—
plained that the purpose ofthe picket
was to “let Goldwater know thaiAl-
bany does not welcome a man to
whom personal property is more
important than human rights.”
