Victims of circumstance

If the University does not take immed-

. late steps to insure the safety of women

traveling to and from motels at night,

, the time will not be longbefore atragedy

occurs.

Already several incidents have oc-
curred on ill-lit street corners; fortun—
ately none of them have been serious;
Vulgar remarks by drunks and attempted
pick-ups by teenagers have been the ex-
tent of these occurrences.

However, the trend should be clear.
The sight of a few lonely girls is a
ready invitation for every psychopath,
pervert, and man on the make in Al—
bany.

We ventured out to the Great Albany
Desert (know colloquially as the new
campi) the other day to see how con-
struction was faring those great waste—
lands.

Basically, construction lsn’t faring too

 

 

Brasilian Student

Thanks Her Hosts

Editor’s Note: The following is an
open letter written to State Univer-
sity by Marly Rosa MacFarlane,
who_ studied at Albany last year
as a foreign exchange student. Her
expenses at this time were met
by the students of the University.

Deor Professors and Students:
Albany State is now just a happy

remembrance for me. It belongs

to my past; it means one of the

. happiest years of my life if not

the happiest.

Before leaving Albany [intended
to say good-bye to all my profes-
sors and friends;unfortunately when
I went to their offices, they were
out.

It may sound strange to say this,
but it’s the truth, it’s very hard to
say good-bye, perhaps forever, to
those people we like and admire.

I’m sure I wouldn’t be able to
control my tears as it happened
were I to say goodbye to,Dr. Car-
rino (Editor’s note: Dr. Carrino is
head of Inter-American Studiesat

' i also intended to write to you
just as soon as I arrived in Brazil.
I tried several times, but it was
all so hard to make words say what
I wished to say, to say what I feel.

I want to thank you for this great
and wonderful experience you gave
me the chance of having. Thank
you, thank you very much.

During the year I spent in Al-
bany I not ohly learned the sub-
jects I studied, but I also learned
about the country and people.

Now besides being a better
teacher, I can explain to my people
that America is not what we see in
the movies, that people are not all

cowboys, gangsters, divorced mov- ‘

ie-stars, or delinquents.

I can tell them how kind and nice
American people are and how beauti-
ful the country is.

My professors used to say I was
wordy; that’s a Latin American de-
fect, and that's what l'm doing now.
I know, but I had to express my
feelings, to tell you how grateful
I am. Once again, thank you.

Sincerely yours,
Murly Rosa Moclorland

 

It is only a matter of very short    

time, we feel, before something will
happen.

We ask the University to work out
some method to protect its students.
Even if guards must be hired for some
of the street corners, we feel it would
be a hideously false economy not to
take such steps.

The University is responsible for
the protection of its students, whether
they live in dormitories or motels. If
the expense be greater to provide pro-
tection for girls in motels, then so be
it.

The time to act is now.

. by David Childs

Brubacher Hall was unusually ac-
tive the first Saturday ofthe semes-
ter. One would have thought that all
students would have been away for
one of three reasons: freshmen

homesickness, culturists beginning

an active year at the folk festival,
or the veterans exhausting them-

selves at the dance halls. Yet, the

Union was teeming.

At ten thirty that evening a few
couples were dating under the guise
of scholarship. A blonde girl of no
mean attribute was astounding a

ﬂedgling freshman with her knowl-
edge of the physic’s "drop theory."
It is assumed he had the wrestling
drop theory in mind.

Beatlemania
The music accompanying the var-
ious stabs at study was hardly con-

ducive to learning, for a pianist was

running through her repertoire of

Beetle tunes with invigorating verve.
Au audience of a dozen seemed to
be carried away — by the music. I
threw my bag of jelly beans at her
as a sign of appreciation.

Pings, pangs, and subtle pops of
poolbails played a different back-
ground ln the sports arena, but

these noises drove out the hollow-
ness of the large room. All of the

tables were filled, and waiting lines d

and athletic enthusiasts sat in the
large uncomfortable seats — un-
comfortable because they were slip-
pery and large enough for King
Farouk's comfort only.

Pool 0 Spectator Sport
The ultimate in spectator sports
is p001, for there is not the move-

ment required by ping-pong, the
discomfort of cold from soccer, the
heat of baseball, and so on.

The gallery was eager in a dis-
interested way and although the na-
tional pool champions wercnotplay-

mg. each viewer could determine
excellence, employing relativity.

Two older students were playing
a friendly game to twenty-five. The
sandy huirod, n firm-jawed shark,
had nearly won until he became

passionately interested in lancing
a friend with a cue stick. The friend,
who would later compete, was a
duugaree clad girl.

The eventual victor wasugregar—
ious sport whose wedding ring sig-
nuilad the belief that ho was spend-
ing the night out. Willi the game tied
at twenty-four, the samly-imirodhad
the game in his pocket if he could
sink an easy corner allot. The allot

was missed; the married shut and
won.

The next competitor carried the
exhibition into the international

category. It was overheard that he
was from Indonesia. lie was Eastern
but appeared to be Japanese from

every angle. lie had the fine features
of Japan — silky, long black hair.

wide dark eyes, chiseled facial lines,
accurate movements.

Before the game was finished,
several people came through the
No Entrance door.

’l‘wo charming freshmen girls
came in and were immediately intro-

duced into pool hall society by the
sandy-haired.

The girls were homesick but were
bearing the loneliness. A soccer
player took a seat among many can-

versationaiisis, two basketball play-
ers dropped by and left saying they
would see some other men at

O’lieaney's after the men had fin—
ished their milkshakes.

Folk Show Praised
Dozens came by after the folk
show and praised lt. Four ping-

pongers played a half-hearted game,
but most unconsciously danced the
twist as the speaker was finally

turned on. Madness had found

another haven.

Not too easily did the Easterner
lspose of the late surge of Married.

However, he did win and uneasily
took up the battle with the Duugnrec

Dull (you will note how easily hust-
lers are tagged with colorful han-
dies.)

There was a similarity in their
games. Both bad sound judgment,

vivid concentration, gentle cue bund-
ling, and desire. Though both were
slender and handsome, they cou—

trasted in three ways: black against
blond hair, his right against her
left, be against she.

ills game suffered Somewhat from
occasional blasts and a definite pull
to the right on many allots.

Contest Bridges Gap
But the match was brilliant in
that two unique individuals were

meeting in silent contest. The boy
seemed to be thousands of fillies
from home.

The girl was breaking the male
barrier. By taking a chance on a

poor night, they had found relief
from what tilled them. They showed
themselves to the world and there-

by met muro civilized people than
had they spent a Week lighting
through countless bottles of lien-
drlck’s and rock iuuen (as i had.)
