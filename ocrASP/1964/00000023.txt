STATE RUN'NERS set to start 4-mile race against Brooklyn Col-

lege last Saturday.

Brooklyn College Beats
State Soccer Team 6-0

by Ray McCloat

Overpowered by a strong and well-balanced Brook-
lyn College team, the varsity soccer team took a 6-0
shellacking in its first game of the season, last
Saturday on University Field. Henry Spadaccini, with
three goals, and Alex Jormach, with a goal and an
assist, were the stars for the Brooklyn team which
has now shut out its first two opponents.

State’s booters couldn’t
cope with Brooklyn’s su-
perior offensive thrusts,
as Albany’s overworked
goalie, Ron Hamilton, was
time and again 'forced to
come up with key‘saves.

Fullbacks Len Bergen and Dick
Syzmanski, and halfbacks Fred
Rowe; Luis Ospina, andTom Flan-
agan formed atenacious defensethat
repeatedly thwarted Brooklyn’s of-
fensive drives, especially in the
second and third quarters.

Tsododa Leads Offense
States offense couldn’t get roll-
ing, sloppy ball handling and poor
passing curtailed many of the Fed’s
drives for points. Maurice Tsododo
was the mainstay for the offense
as his tricky footwork baffled the
opponents inlu committing many
mistakes.

Brooklyn’s hooters completely
dominated the first quarter, shoot-
ing twelve times, scoring twice.
Albany could only muster up two
shots in the initial period, neither

coming close to paydirt.

With only 11:48 gone by in the
game, Henry Spadaccini drove home
a penalty kick to put Brooklyn one
up. Albany then put together its
best attack of the game but the
blitz on the goal was foiled when
the ball was intercepted in transit.

Defense Takes Over

Brooklyn’s klcksters then pro-
ceeded to adroilly work the bail
deep into State territory, and, cap-
italizing on a defensive lapse by the
Feds, scored on 3 Larry Catello
boot, at 14:48.

Defense prevailed in the second
and third quarters. Both teams con-
tinually failed to take advantage of
fast breaks and defensive miscues.
However, ,with slightly over three
minutes left in the third quarter
Spadaccinl pulled a beautiful left-
footed boot into the net to make the
score 3-0.

Brooklyn scored three times in
the final quarter, one by Spadaccini,
and the other two by Frank Scalli,
and Alex Jormach. All three goals
came on heavy rushes at the goal,
with usually at least three Brook-
lyn men potential scorin 'threats.

ALBANY 3. NEW YORK

; Classes to Compete

ln Camus, Egg-loss

Centering around inter—
class athletic competitions
the first All—University
Field Day begins tomor-
row at 12 noon.

The Field Day is a brand new
event at State, designed to fill the
void left by the ending of the tra-
ditional series of Rivalry sports
events.

Unlike Rivalry, however, all four
classes will compete in tomorrow’s
series of contests.

The presidents of the three upper
classes will lead their respective

‘ groups. The Guardians of the Class
I of '68 plus MYSKANIA members will
lead the fresh.

The events are scheduled to take
place between 12 noon and 3 p.m.
on the University Playing Field.

Tugs of war, softball, volleyball,
and an egg toss are the four cate-
gories in which the classes will be
competing.

There will be both limited and
unlimited contests in the men’s and
women's tugs of war, with an elim-
ination tournament to determine the
winner. MYSKANIA will also com-
pete in a tug with the freshmen.

Only those persons who have com-
pleted or are now completing their
Physical Education requirements
are eligible to participate in the

.- All-University Field Day on Satur-
day, October 3, 1964.

Anyone who has a medical excuse
and wishes to play MUST present a
written clearance from the medical
office to the chairman of the event,
Bill Bale, on Saturday at the Uni-
verslty Field.

Student Demand Forces
Increased library Buying

Increased book borrowing,as well
as increased student enrollment , has
led the Universary to greatly en-
large its stock of books. The rapid
enlargement is also in anticipation
of 'the move to the New Campus.

According to Miss Alice Hastings,
college librarian, an average of 30
books per student were borrowed
in the 1961-62 school year, when this

year’s senior class entered as
freshmen. Last year, however, the
number of books borrowed per stu-
dent reached 45, an increase in 15
books per pupil over a three year
span.

Buying New Volumes

The library now has 100,000 vol-
umes and is rapidly buying new
books. Preparing to meet the even-
tual number of one million volumes
which will be shelved on the new
campus, the library has purchased
10,000 books since last June.

The new volumes are being
shelved in the carriage house and
in a building on Central Avenue.
These books are available for stu—
dent use and are listed in the card
catalogue. b1 order to acquire a
book shelved in either of these
buildings, a student must fill out a
book request slip.

A special machine, an electri-
cally run cart, is used to transport
the books. This unusual cart will
be used indoors at the new campus
since gas motors cannot be used
because of the toxic fumes.

The yellow cart, operated by stu—
dent assistants, makes two Irips
for books daily, at 11:30 a.m. and
2:30 p.m. It is necessary for stu-
dents to requcsl books at least one
day before they will need them.

Relerence Librar

Because students living at the
new campus next semester will find
it difficult to r-olnmute to the li-
hrary, a small reference library
will be provided for them. When
the main library moves out next
September, the small reference li-
brary will be transplanted to the
Old Campus.

"The students are being pro-
vided with the best service under
the circumstlmces,” said Miss
Hastings. She also pointed out “that
undergraduates are getting better
service as undergraduates because
of the expansion in graduate ma-
terial now available at the college."

Lost and Found

A white—gold Mormon wristwatch
with a black band was lost lust Fri-
day between the Faculty Dining Room
and the parking lot across Western.
A reward is offered for its return.

FRIDAY. OCTOBER 2. 1964

“ Senate to Require

VOL. L. NO. 21’

Registration

0i Political Groups on Campus

by Mike Fareneli

Three resolutions highlighted the
Student Senate meeting in the Bru-
bacher Dining Hall, Wednesday
night.

First of the three to be passed
was the resolution by Senator Joan
Clark concerning a revised election
procedure when a vacancy occurs
in the senate. The motion was
carried unanimously by all the sena-
tors present and voting.

The second concerned appoint»
ments to one committee andorgan-
lzation for a vacancy election. Sena-
tor Pat Greene was appointed chair-
man of the Solicitation Committee.

The Election Committee notified
the Senate that Replacement Elec-
tions would be held for the offices
of senator and vice president of the
Sophomore Class and senator from
the Junior Class.

Tobey vs. Sneddon

The last, most fiery resolution,
submitted by Senator Gene Tobey.
concerned the registration of par-
tisan political groups with Organ-
ization Recognition Committee,
headed by Senator Tobey. The reso-
lution obliged the political groups
on campus to regisler with the
committee and to abide by a code of
fair practices concerning slander
and libel.

Senator Tobey met with sharp
opposition from Senator Len Sned-
don. President Johnston intervened
in behalf of Senator Tobey when
Sneddon questioned who would de-
termine slander and libel.

In the final vote the resolution
was carried by a vote of 36-],
with Senator Sneddou casting the
lone dissenting vote. When asked
why he voted against the measure,
Sneddou replied, “i don't agree
with the slander and libel part of
the bill.”

Library for Motel Dwellees
President Johnston announced that
Alice Hastings, University Librar-
ian, wanted to meet with a student
group concerning extended hours
for the liawley Library befitting
those forced to exist in motels.
Barbara Leihman and Bruce. Dan-
iels were chosen by the Senate as
nominees for the Committee on Ar-
tists, Speakers, and Convocations.
President Johnston noted that he

would be available in the Student
Association office from the hours
of 6:30 p.m. until 9:00 p.m. on
Tuesday night and 6:30 p.m. until
7:20 p.m. on Wednesday night.
Senator Robert Gable also em-
phasized that all senators wishing
to submit resolutions must place
them in his student mailbox before
noon on any Tuesday for considera-
tion by the Ways and. Means Com-
mittee.
Senate finally decided on an alternate
date for the trip to Dipplkill. The
trip will take place October 25 and
possibly will utilize the autos of the
individual senators in an effort to
save money. After this vote the
meeting was adjourned.

Grants Available
For Study Abroad

American students who wish to
study in South America can apply
for scholarships in accordance with
Fulbright Hays Program. The pro-
gram seeks to promote better in-
ter-American relations.

Beginning graduate students and
graduating seniors can both benefit
from this program. Approximately
50 grants for the 1965—66 academic
year will be available to these stu-
dents through an associated program
supervised by the Board of Foreign
Scholarships and administered by
the Institute of International Educa-
tion.

The Fulbright-Hays Program
which began in 1963 sends students
to most of the undeveloped, emer-
ging republics in Latin America in
which the number of U. S. students
has traditionally been small.

Candidates for the awards must
be U. S. citizens and single, with
at least a bachelor’s degree by
the beginning date of the grant and
proficiency in the language of the
host couryry. in addition, candidates
must be aware of Latin America’s
culture and heritage.

Winners of scholarships will live

in university housing and will beex-
peeled to participate in the academic
and social student life ofihe assigned
country.
