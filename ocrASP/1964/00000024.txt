‘ Kennedy A Competent Man
Says incensed ASP Reader

To the Editor:

In a recent issue of the ASP_ the
readers were treated to an editorial
entitled “Waving Bloody Flag Poor
Tactics." It was hard to comprehend
how a newspaper which usually con-
tains editorial opinion of a higher
quality, could publish an article
which was so lacking in factual ma-
terial and so completely filled with
fallacious reasoning.

The author of the article chose
to pick out certain “traits” of Mr.
Kennedy and use them as an argu-
ment against his being elected to
represent New York State in the
U. S. Senate. However, arguments
that were presented against the elec-
tion of Mr. Kennedy were so lacking
in reason and good judgment on the
part of the author that the reader
became confused as to whether he
was reading the editorial page ofthe
ASP or a page in ahumor magazine.

Motel Salary Slump

This university has reached the epitome of bur-
eaucratic stupidity this semester. The current prob-
lem has been brought about by the occurrence. of
motels instead of New Campus dormitory housing.

When the original budgets were made up last year,
provision was made for office help and other salaried
positions in each of the new complexes. .

September arrived with incompleted housing sched-
ules and because there were no dormitory units, bud-
gets for their maintenance were discarded. In actual-
ity, there is no official recognition fiscally of the
four motels being used temporarily.

Six hundred students occupied the motels in Septem-
ber, but no paid office staff was included in the oc-
cupation.

It has been up to the Resident Assistants and House
directors so far to take care of office duty. With the
distances and time involved in transportation to and
from motels, it is difficult even for an Assistant to
serve for desk duty all afternoon.

As far as the budgets are concerned, the director
of at least one motel has been told that as a result
of the budget situation they are “fortunate” to be
drawing a salary.

To alleviate matters, some of the girls in the
motels have taken certain hours as desk duty. No
promises are ventured concerning when they will be
paid for their office services.

Still other girls are being told that they must sit
desk during prescribed hours or be served a campus
if they fail to do so.

The motel situation is an unwieldy one, but def-
initely demands adequate administrative attention.
Budgetary matters are important in any business or-
ganization. especially when the policy affects six
hundred students and the “dormitory” establishment
in which they live.

One point mentioned in the article
was that Robert Kennedy used his
voice to "give a perfect mimicry
of the late John Kennedy." This
seems an interesting point to make
since it seems to indicate that Rob-
ert Kennedy, aside from being ac-
tive in politics, also has certain
acting talents.

of course, the author conveniently
overlooked the fact thatRobertKen-
nedy is the brother of the late Pres-
ident and it is quite common for
brothers to sound alike.

Next the editorial presented bril-
liant statements concerning the
opinionated fact thati obert Kennedy
"could only be an infe 'tor replace-
ment for the man win so vigor and
dedication inspired the world” and
that Senator Keating hasa' ‘superior
knowledge of the issues.”

As far as Senator Keating having
a superior knowledge of the issues,
this may be true, but his 5 1/2
years as a Senator has not proved
to be a great indicator ofhis making
use of this alleged superior knowl-
edge. This bring us to the crux of
the situation.

Do the voters of the State of New
York (sometimes known as the Em-

an as Senator who is in a position

ful place among the leading states
of the nation.

Robert F. Kennedy is a man who
has the drive and personal courage
to accomplish this and his election
will also give the State representa-,
tion from both parties — something
which makes good political sense.

If the‘ author of the recent editorial
had chosen to attack Rabert F. Ken-
nedy’s stand on certain issues then
an article against him might have
some credibility and might be sym-
pathetically treated by readers.

However, all that the author of
this editorial had done is shown
his own inferiority in an under-
standing of politics and not that of
Mr. Kennedy.

intend to illustrate that while Gold-
water's policies are no more than
irrational answers to basic prob-
lems which he oversimpltfles, Lyn-
don Johnson's policies and those
programs he has supported are rea-
sonable and sound measures which'
have begun to move America toward
the "greater society" of which he
so often speaks.

Tile Civil Rights Act of 1964 has
become public law. We agree with
Barry Goldwater “...that a man in
business who advertises for custo-
mers to come to his store or place
of business and to make purchases
from hiln cannot deny that cus-
tomers, regardless of race, creed,
or color, the opportunity to pur—
l'chase in any department ofthat store
or business."

Votes Against Civil Rights Act

Yet Barry Goldwater voted against
the Civil Rights Act because he cori-
siders the Federal Government to bc
encroaching on states' rights in cer-
tain sections of the bill. He has said
that “States' rights are inseparable
from state rcsponsibiiities...", but
we hardly tilink that Mississippi or
Alabama will ever pass a law which.
allows Negroes to be placed on a
basls equal to Caucasians, or that
these states will eliminate tile"Jim
.Crow“ statutes which sanction the
subjugation of Negroes. In order for
the Negroes to gain equality, the
Federal Government mustintervene
‘fnr lnarly states are deaftolhecries
of a tortured minority.

National Police Force Necessary

Senator Goldwater has played upon
the fears of whites by promising to
make the streets safe and to end Vio-
fence by Negroes. For Goldwater,
as Chief Executive, to accomplish
this, he would have to inaugurate a
national police force with powers
that would obviously duplicate the
powers of existing state and munici-
pal agencies. Yet, Goldwater fears
the Civil Rights Act because "Such
a law could even open the door to a
police-state system of enforcement
that would eventually threaten the

I

i , 

James Reston, Associate Editor of
the “New York Times," says: "He,
Goldwater, condemns Johnson for
intervening too much in the lives
of individual cities and states, but
wants him to intervene even moreto
maintain order all over the country.

"He says he wants freedom and
equality for everyone, but he also
wants to leave the Negroes to the
tender mercies of the Governors of
Mississippi and Alabama."

Civil nghts and Poverty

The Civil Rights Act, whose pas—
sage was promoted by President
Johnson and Senator Hubert Humph-
rey, calls for the desegregation of
public accomodaiions and assists in
legally elevating the Negro to equal:-
ty with whites.

Acts such as this. coupled th
Johnson's “war on pverty,” should
greatly benefit slum areas where
Negroes are often ghettoed and othr-r
economically depressed areas. The
“war on poverty” will provide sorc-
iy needed improvements in C(llit'ii-
tionai and vocational training and
other measures designed in mm—
come economic stagnation and tho
resulting social stagnation.
