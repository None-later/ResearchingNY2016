'by Elisabeth Honnatt Wobre
It is almost an impossibility to
try to write anything really mean-
ingful about Japan in one page; it
is impossible for me to express in
such a short space the significance
and meaning of my experience in
Japan. There are too many things
to say and much the much of what
i saw and did is inexpressible in
any terms. The Japan of today is
a country oi contrarles, of ana-
chronisms, of romance and of pro-
citanal realities.
relating to you something mean-

ingful about Japan, I will try to let
Japan speak for itself. Necessarily
some of this will have to be com-
mentedr

I will introduce to you Japan as
I was introduced, by a letter from
a young college student.

"I felt relieved to know that you
wanted to know true Japan. In every-
thing it is difficult to know truth.
In present, Japan is misunderstood
by many people. Especially Euro-
pean people, many of them do not
know present Japan, but Japan oi
sixty years ago. From now on the
world will be smaller and smaller.
So it is very important for you to
know the true Japanese lives.”

And knowing truth proved more
difficult then is conceivable. We
were asked to visit many schools
to talk with the students. The stu-
dents proved painfully shy, and at
the same time unbearably eager to
talk to “Americans.” (That word
said with an awesome and wor-
shipping tone by students.) The first
question I was asked was, "Is Patty
Duke real life in America." (For
those uneducated in the realtns of
television Patty Duke is a situation
comedy, etc.) Never having seen
Pattie Duke, I could only assume
it to be comparable to the same
species of shows I knew, I asked
“Are the samurai (Japanese cow-
boy) really Japan." There was a
tremendous outburst of laughter,
and then some comprehending faces.

Please, Foreigners

Perhaps more than anywhere else
it is hard to really know what is
Japan. The Japanese are extremely
concerned with phasing foreigners
and this may result in completely
false conceptions on our part. Time
and again we faced the problem of
face-saving. For example the Jap—
anese never partake of liquid with
meals. One day in a restaurant
(where they served water) I drank
some with my meal, and my "father"
drank his water to the exact same
mark.

I envied his keen sense of

sight, and reminded myself to
brighten my sense of awareness.
This often became ridiculous, as
we would try to follow their order
in eating and they would wait for us
to begin. But somehow we managed
to learn by making friends with
Japanese of whom we could ask
confidential and forthright ques-
tions. Our only source of sure
knowledge was friends who usually
had had a great deal of contact
with Westerners or Had been to
America, and consequently were
our only source of sure knowledge.

PSYCiWiOgies Diflar

Japanese and America psychol-
gies are poles apart and one only
comes to realize this after discus-
sion. For ostensibly Japan is Wes-
ternized to a large extent. No,
Westernized is the wrong word,
industrialized is more correct. So
often we equated industrialized and
.modernized with Westernization.

Perhaps the Japanese language
could stand as a metaphor for the
whole of Japanese life. The lan-
guage is such that one cannot ask
a direct question. All things are too
subtle, illusive, and complicated
to be answered forthrightiy. There
are no direct answers. Yet Japan
is dealing now with things areant
that sixty, even thirty years ago.

The basics of the language, as
of the society, remain unchanged,
but they built adopt in toto foreign
elements. The young people still
prefer arranged marriages, but
there is an aura of the “romantic”
involved. The girls go to college,
but still prefer t

Madam Dramatic Century

There are modern street cars,
buses, subways, trains and these
provided a stage for one of the
most dramatic centuries we found.

The people in public Vehicles
shoved and pushed unconcernedly
and unmercifully; they were, b),
our standards extremely rude. Yet
in the homes we ex ienced un-
believable degrees ofthoughfulness,
politness and hospitality. The only
answers seemed to lie in the fact
that Japan has such a tradition
bound auburn. In the Japan of sixty
years ago there were no provisions
for conduct on public facilities,
hence anything goes today.

Yet somehow in spite of the sur-
face characteristics of Japanese
society, I came away feeling that
Japanese and Americans are es—
sentially alike. The Japanese are
experiencing tremendous cultural,
economic, and social changes; we
share many of Japan’s problems.

One of the things I learned in-
volved an incident in the bath. We
were told not put cold water in the
tub, because many people must suck
in the water. At the hot springs the
water circulates continually illiuiite
tub, but there are cold water spig-
ois. However, having been fore-
warned about the cold water, we
immersed ourselves into the boil
ing cauldron.

After dressing our first degree
burns, our always calm and some-
what cryptic Japanese co-lcader
quipped, “You try too hard.”

Pettit Returns After

by Debby i: rlodrnan

ALIANY “ﬂow

“It was the finest year of my life.” said Dr. Paul Bruce Pettit. chairman of
Speech and Dramatic Art, when looking back on the ’63—’64 academic year that

he Spent as producer-director of the Greek-
Cyprus and related travels in eastern Europe

Cypriot National Theatre in Nicosia,
and Western Asia.

Dr. Pettit departed for Cyprus in September, 1963 with his family to assume his
position which was received through the auspices of the Fulbright grant program at

the proposal of the United
States Department 'of State.
According to Dr. Pettit.
Nicosia is a true Renais—
.sance town. About 40,000
people reside there and almost half
of the population lives in the old
city which is one mile in diameter.
This area is surrounded by a fit-
teenth century Venetian wail.

"Match Maker" Presented

He spent the first few months in
Nicosia making plans for the first
production of the theatre. The play
selected was Thornton Wilder’s
“The Match Maker."

The problems encountered in pro-
ducing this play in Greek were
unique. The play opened on January
4, however hostilities between the
Greeks and the Turks broke out
December 20, 1963.

By December 24, the fighting
reached a peak. Christmas eve over

Qwo hundred people were killed one-
ialf mile from Dr. Pettit's apart—
ment.

On Christmas Day Turkish jets
buzzed the city while an invasion
ﬂeet was poised for action only
fourteen miles away.

"Heaven and Hall" Limbo

Amid this turmoil plans for “The
Match Maker" progressed and in
the midst of alimbo between “Heav-
en and Hell" the play opened in
January for a month's run at the
“Othak,” the Greek-Cypriot Na-
tional Theatre.

"The opening night. was one I'll
never forget,” said Dr. Pettit as
he recreated the spectacle. Over

all of the audience arrived carry—
ng machine guns in case of emer-
gency.

However, the first production was
well-received by the Cypriots. Dr.
Pettit said that the people seemed
to understand the American thought
in the play and were very cognizant
of American ideas.

lie said that the typical Mid—Eas-

ierner knows a great deal about the
United States.

Uprising Causes Evacuation

While in Cyprus, Dr. Pettit and
Archbishop Makarios began pre-
liminary work on the formation of
the first University in Cyprus. The
uprisings suspended these plans,
but there is a good chance that the
project will be revived.

In‘ the beginning of February, Dr.
Pettit, his wife and faintly were
hastily evacuated from Cyprus as
the question of personal safety
arose. _

When Dr. Pettit was forced to
leave Cyprus, the second production
of the Greek—Cypriot Theatre, Ar-
thur Miller’s "Death of a Sales-
man,” was ten days away from pre-
sentation. The play was never per-
formed.

Plans Suspended

This was a frustrating experience
for Dr. Pettit since so much time
and effort had gone into the planning
for this second production.

Plans for a summer festival there
had also been formulated. Lillian
Hellnian’s “Always the Lark” had
been selected as the first play.

Prior to his departure, Dr. Pettit
had a hair-raising experience in
Nicosia. Frotn the direction of the
old city, he heard a blast which
rocked Nicosia. Sensing the area
the explosion catne front, he said-
to his wife, "They just bombed the
American Embassy.”

The question was,
happen next?

what would

Cyprus Bombing

The bombing took place Feb. 4
and within two days almost every
American was evacuated frotn Cy-
prus. Dr. Pettit had the choice of
going to Athens, Greece or Beruit,
Lebanon. lie chose Athens since he
had lived there thirteen years be-
fore.

After a tnonihin Athens,he settled
down in an apartment and used the
city as a base of operations.

On the basis of his work in Cyprus,
Dr. Pettit received invitations to
work in Cairo, Egypt or Damascus.
He did most of his work in Damas-
cus and never returned to Cyprus.

Under a grant from the State
University of New York Research
Foundation, Dr. Pettit then under-
took a tour of National Theatre: in
eastern Europe and Western Asia.

Eastern European Tour

He visited national theatres in
Ankara, Istanbul, Warsaw, Prague,
Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Buch-
arest, and Sofia. Dr. Pettit spoke
to about 250 theatre artists and saw
about sixty productions. “in two
tnonths, I got about two hours’
sleep," he recalled.

Dr. Pettit was to go to Russia,
but ten hours before he was to
board the plane, he was denied a
visa with no reason given. What
he saw in other Iron Curtain coun-
tries is forming the base of a
report he is writing on Eastern
European theatre for the State De-
partment.

He emphasized the staggeringim-
age of the United States abroad.
Everything that happens here be—
comes important abroad. Much is
expected of us and “the world, in-
cluding the Iron Curtain countries,
expects leadership, guidance, and
moral strength from us."

American "Imago" Abroad

Dr. Pettit said “the terrifying
thing to me is that we see our low
image abroad written about, when
the opposite seems to be the case.”

He said he was shown tnuch af-
fection, even behind the Iron Cur-
filth and felt secure at all titnes.
There was no restriction to his
movement.

During the year, Dr. Pettit ob—
served the two things thai hurt our
tillage abroad lnost during the past
year to be the race riots and Ken-
nedy’s assassination. The general
reaction was how could that happen
in the U.S.

The people then reasoned that we
have no right to tell them how to
solve their problems when we have
ones such as these.

Though, in retrospect, the year
was a frustraiin ,' one for Dr. Pettit,
be accomplished much and has many
plans for the future.

He is looking into the possibility
of organizing an International Re-
search Center for Theatre here and
study centers in Athens or Beruit
for traveling State students.

Based on his travels, Dr. Pettit
said that his main wishis for Amer-
ican students to galnastrong under-
standing of history and master at
least one foreign language so that
they will be able to tmderstand the
world around them and appreciate
what they see.
