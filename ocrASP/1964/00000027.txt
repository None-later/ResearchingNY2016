- ElNISHING TWO HUNDRED YARDS ahead of his nearest o

record.

  

in Schielielin: New liosli coach

Two years ago Albany State lost
its Homecoming soccer game 2-0 to
'Bi'ockport. One of Brockport’s out-
standing players in that game was
Bill Sdliieffelin. This year the frosh
soccer, "Basketball, and baseball
teams will be coached by the same
Bill Schieffelln. '

After getting his 13.8. in physical
education, Coach Schieffelin at-
tended the University ofNorth Caro-

     

Dill Scbioflolln

llna to study for his Master's De-
gree. While at North Carolina, he
coached the freshman soccer team.
Eventually, he intends to extend his
education to the doctoral level.

Prior to attending Brockport,
Coach Schieffelin served a hitch in
the Marine Corps. He grew up in
Rochester, where he attended West
High School. At West High he par-
ticipated in swimming, smear, and
baseball.

Commenting on his first few weeks
at State, Coach Schieffelin said, “i
really enjoy working with the frosh
soccer team; they’re a fine group of
boys." He also noted that he has
found the other members of the
physical education department
pleasant men to work with.

"As far as physical facilities at
Albany are concerned, I’m much
more impressed with future per-
spective rather tnan present fa-
cilities," Coach Schieffelin said.

He is married and has one child,
a son who is eighteen months old.

Led by Tom Robinson’s

record breaking perform-

ance. the cross-country team topped Siena 20-39,
Tuesday. at Siena’s home course. Robinson. who has
now smashed the Siena course record for the third
consecutive year, was clocked at 17:01.6 for the 3.5
mile course. bettering his 1963 record by fourteen

seconds.

The victory was the sec-
ond straight for the Feds
this season. They defeated
Brooklyn College in their
first meet last Saturday.

Siena’s captain Chuck Connolly
placed second in the race. The one-
two finish of Robinson and Connolly
was nothing new; this pair has fin-
ished in this order for the last
three years in each Albany-Siena
meet.

Third, fourth, and fifth places in
the meet went to Albany’s Dennis
Tuttle, Bob Flick, and John Clark,

If Tom Robinson wins the LeMoyne Invitational
Meet tomorrow, he will have accomplished one of the
most outstanding athletic feats in this school’s history.
Robinson has won this fifteen-team meet the past two
years, setting a new record the first year and breaking
his own record last year.

It is very unusual for a cross-country meet such as
LeMoyne, which annually has many of the state’s finest
runners participating, tobe dominated by the same per-
son for more than one year. But. Tom Robinson is cer-
tainly not a usual runner.

Since cross-country's inception at State two years
ago, the team has competed in fourteen dual meets and
two triangular meets; Robinson has won every one of
these meets. Cross-country Coach Keith Munsey ex-
plains Robinson’s fantastic success in this way: “The
red-head is a very smart runner and he just doesn’t
like to lose."

Coach Munsey feels Robinson is the man that the.
other runners will have to beat on Saturday. “There
are a lot of very strong runners competing Saturday,
but Tom has won this race twice and they all realize
that they will have to run a whale of a race to finish
ahead of the red-head,” Coach Munsey said.

Led by Robinson’s first place last year at LeMoyne
and John Clark’s seventh place State finished third in
the overall team competition. This year, with Dennis
Tuttle, Bob Flick. Ed Brown. Ken Darmer, and Jake
Johnville. in addition to Robinson and Clark. the team
has a good chance to repeat its third place and an

outside chance to take first place honors.

touchdown early in the first
quarter on their second

forcing the Animals deep

KB took over possession on Water-

pass to John Gleason for ten yards,

Other outstanding players for KB

The Potter team, out to once

Robinson and Connolly pulled but
ahead early in the race, with Con-
nolly taking a slight lead. Their
pace was extremely fast for the
first mile. They completed the first
mile in five minutes. At that point
Robinson took over the lead and did
not relinquish it for the remainder
of the race.

Coach Keith Munsey was very
satisfied with Tuttle’s third place
finish. “I didn’t think that Tuttle
was in such good shape," Coach
Munsey said. He also pointed out
that Flick was hampered during the
race with severe pain in his stom-
ach.

Both Teams Improved

Munsey noted that both teams
were much improved since last
year. He offered as evidence of this
fact John Clark’s fifth place finish.
Clark, who finished fourth in this
meet last year, improved his time
by twenty seconds but dropped one
slot in the individual placing.

When the waiter refused to open the reg-

thief the receipts herself. She and the waiter
were then ordered to lie on the floor. while
the thief took Miss Spencer outside. As it
was raining heavily, she» was allowed to go
back inside, and the robber ran off.

The women described the thief to the po-
lice as of medium build, about 5 feet 7
inches tall, and having a swarthy complex—
ion. They described as his outstanding char-
acteristic a large shock of black hair. He
wore sunglasses.

The police arrived and questioned the

cars without special permission.

The women had reached Western Avenue,
in front of Waterbury Hall. when the second
incident occurred. They walked with their
heads bent against the rain when two men
.ran by, brushing harshly against Miss Burke.

Realizing that they had grabbed her purse,
she screamed, but although many students
were returning from dates. no one came to
her aid. The two men ran across University

Although a University guard is 'on duty
