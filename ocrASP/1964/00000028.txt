The only Indication that the United States isa nation
of free people comes once every four years or during
wars. When elections and wars coincide, the nation
becomes more servile and dependent than during
 Q normalcy years because men have little choice but
'i ' 5' to keep the ship afloat.

With no outstanding war present now, the nation
is out-performing itself with banner-waving. The
deafening artillery of press propaganda of twa battling
low-blow factions has made political discussion the
most active topic of everyday gossip.

Thus, when Barry (short for some unknown name)
Goldwater (a bitter softdrlnk) blew into town last
Friday, a surprisingly large audience greeted him.
But, to be sure, it was not a partisan crowd but a
conglomeratlon of curious school-skipping students,
time-off state employees, paid standard bearers,
radio, television, and newspaper commentators, a
handful of genuine conservatives, and a number of

‘ representative hecklers such as CORE.

5 No Sensationolism

Most expected to see an ogre surrounded by shock
troops or maybe see a slow drawling southerner
sporting a KKK outfit. They might have hoped to
hear him spout some outlandish accusation or prom-
ise to do some impossible task If elected. His well
wishers longed to hear Rocky make a firm approval
of Goldy. None of these sensations materialized.

For forty-five minutes before the candidates ar-
, a rival, the Al Smith Building scene was a dull com-
‘ bination of unmoving carnival attempts at exciting
I the masses and soft murmurings of wisecracks about
the man. Albany and this state are not expected to
r elect Aqu and thus those who favored him were
looked upon as fanatics.

Republican Drought-Breaker

‘ In the case of this rally, words spoke louder than
, cheers as signs abounded. One interesting warning
. was, "Goldwater - ’64, Bread and Water — ’65,
.' Water — ’66, No Water — ’67" and yet Barry spoke,
"i am happy to say that a Republican broughtan
1-,. end to the drought.” In fact that day produced the
ii first rain Albany had seen in a month. His enemies
= would have said that the drizzle was an omen of
bad weather in the future with the rainmaker.

The police were Well aware that Goldwater is a
figure surrounded by ambivalance. There are some
who hate or fear his ideas. Thus there were numer-
ous bulls in blue on the rally beat. Where these cops
came from is anyone's guess for most looked like
men lucky to find a day's work.

,_ Goldy line—ls — the Rain Daddy

by David Childs

Only a few had pistols and most were very un-
certain as to "what’s to be done." Also, the crowd ,
was infiltrated by a number of private dicks whose
brilliant and shifty eyes gave away their disguise.
There were trouble-shooters on top of adjacent
buildings.

One Man Against Many

No denying the fact that Barry is courageous as
he is bucking a complacent nation, an entire Re-
publican Party, and a strenuous itinerary, yet he
must have a slight fear that some psycopath might
unseat him before the election. Barry is rocking
the boat and the nation cannot figure for whose good.

No ovation greeted the well-tanned, handsome
stumper but he surely quelled a few doubts about
looking like a devil. The Governor, in his foolish
or intelligent political understanding, refrained from
endorsing Goldwater. Rocky is gambling. He does not
expect the elephants to stampede this year so he
reserved his judgment with hopes for his own nom-
ination in ’68. Rocky was at his ineloquent best as
he addressed the folks concerning Barry’s loyalty to
the party.

But the main speaker finally spoke for a few
minutes. The striking feature of his chat was that,
notwithstanding examples of his sarcastic slurs of
a shady administration, the man is great at the soft
sell. He did not shout, use base sympathy, nor blow
fire. His appearance was that of a stalwart of "free-
dom" (said the word humpteen times) in the Wash-
ington manner.

He had nothing new to say but be repeated his
message perfectly and with a minimal glance at
his script. He acted a true party chum by ﬂattering
Rocky and the State plus Keating. If Barry does
nothing more on his million mile march he will
have been a good party leader for praising every
Republican candidate in the nation.

No Return Compliment

The next day he somehow made it to Michigan
where he pushed for Romney but received no re-
turn compllment. As a syndicated columnist has
said, there are now three parties and if Barry
fails, Wallace of Alabama will play the third man
theme.

Though Barry knew he had no chance here, he
nonetheless won many votes from the befuddled
crowd. However, one wonders if some unknown
might not throw his hat in before the day and mir-
aculously pull off an unprecedented write-in victory.

We re rd the recent creation of the post of Pub-
lic Relat‘iZns Director as a highly worthwhile step
in fostering better communications within the Uni-
versity cOmmunity. I

This long, overdue move should go a long way
towards ending the confusions, lapses, and misunder-
standings that have marked the administration’s
rather, half-hearted attempts to make its purposes and
aims known to the student body in the past.

Accurate public relations, especially for institu-
tions the size of this University. are an accepted and
indeed a vital part in securing rapport between a
secure hierarchy and great numbers of individual
people. In the past our administration has too often
overlooked this simple method of maldng itself better

, Keri Dar-ands
Dennis Church, Joseph Holley

understood.

The problems that the University presently faces,
and will face for years to come, demand that a work-
able means of communications be in operation. Any
breakdown can only be to the University’s disadvan-

tags.

The new Public Relations Director, Mr. Van Dyck,

seems admirably well—qualified for his new position.

We wish him the best
useful and powerful force

of success. He can be a
in the development of the

University. If the administration takes full advantage
of the possibilities offered to it by this position,
much good can be done in furthering the development

of the University.

Chairman Sends Thanks
To Goldwater Volunteers

To the Editor:

We wish to express our sincere
appreciation to the young women
from State who helped to make the
rally for Senator Goldwater the
tremendous success that it was.

We were pleased with the large
number of college-age people who
took an active part in the rally
and provided the enthusiasm which
is necessary for a successful rally.

We believe that these young men
and women are characteristic ofthe
many thousands of young adults who
have rallied to the support of the
Republican nominee from the cam-
puses of more than 900 American
colleges and universities.

In the Capital District, many of-
the colleges already have Youth
for Goldwater-Miller clubs which
are taking an active part in the
campaign. They are demonstrating
the fact that American youth is
interested in responsible govern—
ment and in the preservation of
the American Way of Life.

We hope to see a Youth for
Goldwater-Miller organization es-
tablished at Albany State in the
near future.

Communications Process 0!
ASP Found inadequate

To the Editor:

What good is a newspaper if it
doesn’t serve as a means of com-
munication for all students but in-
stead functions as a gossip column?
I refer to almost half of page two
of last Tuesday's newspaper.

The week before last two notices
were submitted to responsible
people with sufficient time for pub-
lication. The result was that neither
was published, either in Friday's
or Tuesday's paper.

The notices pertained to tryouts
for the Advanced Dramatlcs class.
In order for the State University
Theatre to function as a creative
part of the school. the student body
should be Informed of opportunities
to gain theatrical experience.

Is it that the editors value Stu-
dent Union gosslp (p. 2) to notices
of productive and creative activi-
Mes?

Or perhaps it Is mandatory in
publications (as it seems to be at
this schoool) to leave one quarter
of an inch of space between every
two lines regardless of sentence
structure, emphasis in meaning,
or facility of reading and in so
doing, waste space because per-
haps they have lost a few articles
and need filler?

One wonders if the students run-
ning the newspaper realize their
responsibility to all of the students.

Robert Mullen

Editor's Note: The Co-Edltors and
the Arts Editor received no notice
tor the Friday issue, and the notice
for the Tuesday Issue was not re-
ceived In time to meet the deadline.

Solution to Kennedy
Problem Proves Difficult

To the Editor:

it seems that Bobby Kennedy has
stirred up much anguish in the
hearts of New Yori.ers. Many fear
that if elected he will not be able
to represent us adequately since
he has not been a resident in our
state very long.

Yet every four years we cnoose
a man from one state to represent
all fifty states and have few qualms
about his ability to do so.

Now two men from western and
southern states are running on our
National ticket, but we expect that
whoever is elected will represent
the North as well as the South and
West plus Alaska and Hawaii. Yet
Bobby Kennedy is running for an
office in a state which borders or.
his own.

Kennedy’s positionis aprecarious
one simply because he is not from
this state. He must be even better
informed about New York State af-
fairs than the other candidate be-
cause people will constantiy be ques-
tioning him about them.

Jean Wincowski
'Civil Rights' Editorial
Evoke: Serious Questions
To the Editor:

I was puzzled by your September
25 editorial entitled “Mission Ac-
complished?" In it, your editor as-
sorted that the three Mississippi
civil rights workers murdered this
summer had no business being there,
could accomplish nothing, and "ex-
posed themsleves recklessly on an
ill-conceived mission."

Perhaps so. But the editorial
led logically to two implications.
First, people In areas such as
Philadelphia (which abound in “ig-
norance, poverty, and race hatred"
according to your editor) ought to
be abandoned to the forces which
run these communities.

Second, efforts to bring such areas
back into the main-stream ofAmer-
ican life, to abolish their “ignor-
ance, poverty, and race haired,"
ought to be accompanied by greater
protection for the reformers.

What does your editor want, in-
dependence for the unreformabie
South or a new reconstruction un-
der the aegis of federal military
occupation? I find both these al-
ternatives uncomfortable to say the
least.

Milt“? Plans.  ll  " Class

J'l-‘or those who took part, it was
a success,"'ssid Bill Bate, chair-
man of the University Field Day
which was held on Saturday,0ctober

About two hundred students par-
ticipated in this, the first annual
University Field Day. All four
classes competed againsteach other
with the class of '66 emerging vic-
torious.

The event was part of the Failin-
duction Program for freshmen.

Competitions were held in men’s
volleyball, women’s volleyball, coed
volleyball, a balloon toos, men's
softball, women’s softball, women's
tug-of-war, and men’s tug-of—war.

There were fourteen points
awarded for each event — five for
first, four for second, three for
third, and two for fourth.

Several of the events resulted in
ties for one or more of the places.
Such ties occurred in all the volley-
ball matches. A mix-up in the bal-
loon toss resulted in points being
split equally among the classes
there also.

The softball games were easier
to tally, with the Class of ’66 taking
the women's championship, and the
Senior Class winning the men's
event.
