Albany State’s frosh soccer team copped a 3—1
decision in an away game against Cobleskills A 8: T

last Saturday. Plagued by a strong wind and a bright
spn the Peds pushed across three goals in the second

and third periods and maintained their lead to gain
the victory.

third consecutive year. Last year at LeMo

competition with a total score of 113 points.

Bill Ripple, LeMoyne
College, captured individ-
ual honors in twenty min-
utes, seven seconds (20:07)
six seconds slower than
the meet record set by Al-
bany’s Tom Robinson last

year.
Robinson Third

Robinson was third in 20:21; his
time was the fifth fastest rims re-
corded in the meet’s fourteen-year
history. Buffalo State’s Robert
Havok was runner-up with a time
of 21:14.

The race was a three-man battle
from the beginning with Robinson,
Ripple, and Havok running even for
three and one-half miles of 4.2 mile
course. As they approached the last
long hill ofthe rolling course, Ripple
burst into a fifteen—yard lead.

Havok was able to stay close to the
LeMoyne sophomore but Robinson
failed to close the gap. At the top
of the hill, Ripple, using his lead to
advantage, opened up and by the
time his two competitors reaced
the top, took a thirty yard lead which
he continued to increase to the finish
line.

Peds Barely Miss First

The team title was very much in

doubt as the next three Albany run-

 

The Peds looked quite
sloppy at the outset showing
poor passing and ball hand—
ling. The second quarter
was quite different, the
teamwork and coordination
much improved.

ners crossed the finish line within
fifteen seconds of each other. Dennis
Tuttle was ninth in 21:29, followed
by Bob Flick and John Clark in 21:43
and 21:44 respectively. Ken Darmer
finished thirty-fourth.

Coach Munsey was very happy
with the squad’s performance. He
said “we were seventh two years
ago, third last year and second
this year and today's race was, by
far, the toughest of the three.”
Munsey added, "the entire squad
extended themselves and did a won-
derful job.”

Frosh Competition Tough

State's freshman team was sixth
in the nine-team freshman compe-
tition. Buffalo State’s frosh won the
race and Hartwick College placed
second. Joe Keating of Albany was
eleventh in the 70-man field.

Munsey felt that the fresh entries
were better at this me'et than in
previous years. Other Albany frosh
positions were Grant Downs finish-

ing fifteenth, Bob Mulvey twenty-
fifth, and Burd, Parker, Pasko,
and Compeau, who finished fourty-
fourth, fourty-fifth, fifty-first,
and fifty-third respectively.
Evaluating the fresh squad’s per-
formance Munsey said, “they ran
well but they’ll have to learn to
extend themselves more during the
early phases of the race."

Next Meets Saturday

The varsity and fresh both have
their next meets on Saturday. The
varsity barriers will travel to New
Haven State College and the fresh
will compete in an away meet against
Coblesklll.

Albanian Joe LaRaau was excel-
lent all day in the nets. Coach Bill
Schifflin had this to say about Joe,
“I thought LaReau was tremendous.
He stopped five possible scores,
and three of them were penalty
kicks. What is unusual about Joe
is that he had never played soccer
until coming to State."

Coach Schleffelin was very satis-
fied with the hustle and aggressive-
ness displayed by Tim Jursak, Jerry
Leggieri, and Len Eggleston on of-
fense, and of Jim Kelpy, Gary Swar-
tout, and Getachew Habeth-Yiher on
offense.

For Cobleskili, it was “Caesar”
Stoddard who was thathornln State's
side. He was constantly breaking up
fast breaks and scored the Aggies'
lone goal.

Pe'ds Score Early

Afier a scoreless first period,
the Feds broke the scoring ice.
Aggie goalie Bob Cornell was man-
euvered out of position and [aunt-
ceta’s boot sailed true iorthe score.
A minute and ten seconds elapsed
between State’s first score and their
second with Jim Taylor booting home
the 2-0 lead. Innnicatn closed out
the scoring midway throughthe third

University Changes Bus Stops
For Students Traveling at Night

Changes in motel bus pick-up
points and the installation of a
walkie-iaikie system were among
the steps taken last week to insure
greater protection for students at
night.

Action came in response to coin-

‘ plaints by students that they had
been annoyed while waiting for
buses. The need for more efficient
protection was further emphasized
by the purse-snatrhing which oc-
curred in front of Waterbury liull
last Friday night.

in order to keep shutouts from
having to wall for buses in lll-
lighied spots far from buildings,
buses will now pick up students
from in front of Brubncher Hall
and in back of Draper llnll after
dark. During the day the regular
pick-up points will be maintained.

Same Guards

No new guards have been added
to the security staff. A! Diesel“ “19

, University employs two security
guards and one night wnlchmun.

At least one man is on duty at the
Residence Quadrangle WWW“ '7
p.m. and 3 a.m. every night. Extra

protection is provided for weekends.
iil addition, the uniformed security
guard who works at Draper is re-
quired to drive around the residence
halls making a check before he goes
off duty at ll p.m.

The walkie-ialkie system which
was put into effect Monday night,
provides a fast method of commun-
ication with the night waichnmn.
Since he does not adhere to a rigid
schedule, it is impossible to (later-
mine where he will be at a given
moment.

Central Point In Bru

Therefore, a walkis-tulkie has
been placed in the main office of
Brubncher Hall. in case of trouble,
n call to the Drubncher switchboard
will enable the person on duty to
summon the night watchman to the
spot immediately.

If, as is sometimes the case, the
switchboard is busy, a girl is to
be sent to the Ilrubacher office to
deliver the message.

The administration feels that
these new changes will allow guards
to be where they are needed most,
and thus will offer more adequate
protection to everyone.

p.m. at the President's Luncheon.
The Dean's and Department heads
will be present to welcome back
the Alumni. Following the luncheon,
the traditional parade will proceed
at l p.m. up Western Ave.

Floats from various clubs, or-
ganizations, sororities and fratern-
ities numbering over twenty will be
judged on originality, appearance
and appropriateness. The Queen's
float, followed by the attendants’,
will lead the parade.

They will line up on Thuriow
Terrace and when all is in readi-
ness, the entourage will proceed
down Western Avenue to Partridge
Street.

Soccer vs. Potsdam

Immediately following the parade
State challenges Potsdam at the
Homecoming Soccer Game, on Uni-
versity Field. During the game, the
winning ﬂoats will he announced.
The groups sponsoring the winning
ﬂoats will be presented wiiha 825
savings bond.

From 4 to 6 p.m. August mem-
bers of MYSKANIA from all points
in State’s history will assemble for
a reunion at the Lampost at the
corner of Western and Quail Sts.

Senate Gives. Approval
To Groups.’ Constitutions

Although twenty minutes late in starting. the Senate
Wednesday night approved the constitutions of two
organizations, set up several important committees
and accomplished other important business, yet was
able to adjourn in record time.

The constitutions under
consideration were those of
the State University Revue
and the University Free-
dom Council. The Freedom
Council is a new organiza-
tion formed under the aus-
pices of Campus Christian
Council.

Now operating alone, the group
seeks to stimulate interest in civil
rights, inform the University of
opportunities for individuals topar-
ticlpate in civic groups, and to fos-
ter student-faculty dialog on the
issues of freedom and equality.

Their constitution was approved
overwhelmingly, and they were given
funds of $55 from Emergency Spend-
ing. The Revue constitution was also
approved. According to its director,
Mr. Guy, it is to be opened to more
student participation.

Senate Rules

introduced, then tabled for the
mandatory period of three weeks,
were the Senate Rules. The three
page bill, introduced by Senator
Anne Digney, is the culmination
of more than a semester of debate
and revision. Senate presently is
operating under last year’s rules.

Several committees were estab-
lished to carry out various execu-
tive functions. Senate gave approval
to a Solicitations Commission with
Senator Pat Green as chairman.
This commission supervises all so-
licitation carried out by groups on
the campus.

Senator Richard Ten Eyck was
appointed chairman of the ad hoc
committee to consider the new rules.

The commission includes Bruce

Kaufman. Connie Noquist, Gretchen
Van Vleet, and Tom Vandermuellen.

Motel Girls Do

)

Senator Vera Komanowski was
appointed chairman of the "Who’s
Who” committee. This committee
nominates outstanding Seniors, who
they feel are worthy of membership
in the national Who's Who in Amer-
ican Colleges and Universities.

Nominees are later voted upon by
the entire student body, the top 33
receiving the honor.

Working with Miss Komanowski
on this committee will be Senators
Kenny, Friedman, Laundry, and
Kisel, as well as Al Smith, Barb
Townsend, Art Johnston, Mary Tem-
ple, Richard Crossett, Mary Lewis,
and John Sturtevant.

A second committee was formed
to work with Miss Hastings,Univer-
sity Librarian, on revising library
hours. The Library is nowopen until
10 p.m. on weekdays, and until 5p.m.
on Fridays and Saturdays.

Need for Facllitloe

There has been anincreasingneed
for the library to remain openlong-
er, however, to accommodate larger
numbers of students. Requests have
especially been made that library
facilities be available on weekend
nights and on Sundays.

Senator Coon will head the com-
mittee which will look lntotheprob-
lem. He will be assisted by Senators
Dibler, Schmoll, Blackman, Quatar-
are, Friedman, and Kurz.

The appointment of Gretchen
Briant to fill a vacancy in the Elec-
tion Commission was unanimously
confirmed by Senate. Action on a
vacancy existing in Athletic Ad-
visory Board was postponed until
next week, when President Johnston
will give his recommendation.

In closing the meeting, Johnston
stressed the responsibility of the
Senators to support Homecoming
events. ~
