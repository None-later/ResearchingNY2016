liirl tell by Rivalry linlilleri

We have now gone along far enough
with the new substitute-for-Rivalry -
schedule to evaluate its total worth for'
this university campus. We base our
decision on the events experienced thus
far; the Bonfire, University Field Day.
and the Convocation. Add to this the
general lack of any unifying spirit. and
the. picture becomes clear.

Last' spring when it was decided that
the “best thing" for this campus would
be the elimination of a traditional rival-
ry period and the implications such a
period produced. it 'was thought that
events for four classes would pull the
university together in spirit without
creating a class consciousness.

Various inevitable committees met

and planned this fall’s events. Without
a focal point for their new program.
the idea of a new approach to peaceful
coexistence fell flat.

Organization. publicity. and primarily
interest. top the list of incompleteness
and. virtual non-existence. So far, this
program of pseudo-rivalry has not met
previous expectations. . '

From the climate of opinion circulated
up to this point, especially by the fresh-
men members of this community, the
idea of a rivalry revival is not too un-
thinkable. If it enables one fourth of the
student body to make a smooth transition
into college life on this campus. then
maybe a return to the past is a valid
one.

lies Approach to Formals llerrlal

We think the time has come for Stu-
dent Association to take a long. hard
look at the concept of formal weekends
at State.

As presently organized these week-
ends are a tremencbus drain on the
pocketbooks of a student body that in
the main could not be less interested
in them.

The spectacular fiasco of Junior Week-
end iast year. and the imminent failure
of Homecoming are indicative that some-
thing is seriously wrong with State's
approach to formal weekends.

Last semester only 50 couples attended
the Junior Weekend formal: as of Wed-
nesday night only 200 tickets had been
sold for this Friday’s folk concert at
the Washington Armory.

We feel that this waste will be stopped
only when an effort is made to obtain

Spat: Shows More Action

e see that Senate has finally come
to the point where passage of Senate
Rules is likely. Even though this is over
a semester behind schedule, at least
Senate will not have to go through the
entire year operating under the rules
of its predecessor.

We understand that passage at this
time is due primarily to the fact that
the Senators held a special meeting to
iron out all their differences before thet
bill came onto the Senate floor.

if this had been done at the beginning
of last semester. a great deal of need-
less, time-consuming debate on the Sen-
ate floor would have been avoided. and
Senate would now be operating under
its own rules. .

“name performers” for the concert
portion of weekends. and when an effort
is made to make the formals far more
exclusive.

Judy Collins and the Modern Folk

uartet might be less expensive than
Peter, Paul and Mary. but where is the
saving when three-quarters of available
tickets go unsold?

As for the formals'. Universities this
size really have no need for high school
suit and tie type dances. A formal should
be just what its name implies. It should
be planned for relatively few students
(since it is only the few that attend
anyway) in mind.

Student Association must come to
face the realities of social life in the
University. and abandon an approach
has proved unworkable.

However. the fact that debate has so
far been carried out in special meetings
shows. we hope. an increasing maturity
on the part of Senators.

The meetings have also been short
and usually to the point this year. There
has been less of a tendency to quibble
over parliamentary technicalities. and
most of the questions and debate have
been relevant to the issue.

if this trend continues, it will be the
best thing that has happened to Senate
in a long time. When Senators forego
the personal glory of having their argu-
ments heard by the whole Senate. and
use the Senate meeting for final action
on bills rather than preliminary debate.
student government will stop marking
time and start moving ahead,

by Phyllis [lottery Psvrodino

James Pryor mad'e‘the following
statement in the September 29 edi-
tion of the ASP: "let Goldwater
know that Albany does not welcome.
a man to whom personal property
is more important than human
rights.” .

First, I believe Mr. Pryor is
referring to both real and personal
property, for certainly, Senator
Goldwater's efforts have been more
explicitly for the salvation of real
property than of personal property.

Secondly, what are property rights
if not human rights? — Animal
rights? Vegetable rights? We can
make no distinction between the
rights of property and human rights,
because the former is a subdivision
of the latter.

Maximum Freedom

Mr. Goldwater advocates, in the
"Conscience of 9. Conservative,
that his goal is to achieve "... the
maximum amount of freedom for
individuals that is consistent with
the maintenance of the social or-
der.”

All rights stem from the right to
be free. As Goldwater is for a free
nation, he will inevitably help the
Negro to be free; to gain his rights
In an American citizen.

He believes that the problem of
race relations, like all social and
cultural problems, is best handled
by the people directly concerned.

Social and cultural change, how-
ever desirable, should not be per-
formed by the engines of national
power. We should try to improve
faulty institutions through persua-
sion and education, but let us do so
in an orderly fashion with respect
the process of the law.

Property Rights Insecure

Any other course enthrones ty-
rants and dooms freedoms. We
should keep in mind that a society
where property rights are insecure
is a totalitarian society, and in such
a society no right is secure.

What seemstobother some groups
is that Goldwater refuses to cham-
pion the rights of any one group
overthe rights of any other. The
results may at times seem harsh,

but in the end are the most just for
all concerned. _

ls’it proper to deprive one person
of his human rights to satisfy
another? It would appear to me a
more equitable solution to accom-
plish the desired result through
love and understanding rather than
by hard and fast laws.

The Civil Rights Act calls for
desegregation of public accommo-
dations and assists in legally ele-
vating the Negro to equality with
whites. ls this all they want? I
think not. We must and prejudice,
and by this means alone can the
Negro ever hope for equality.

Legol Proludlce

Making it a legal offense for an
individual, in the conduct of his
own affairs, to decide for himself
the person with whom he chooses
to do business, irrespective of race,
color, or creed, is only going to
intensify prejudice.

By acknowledging realities; by op-
posing impetuous legislation and ar-
birsry judicial shortcuts; by effec-
tive measures against unemploy-
ment and restrive union practice;
by freeing the economy to expand
dynamically and thus offer new jobs,
the Negro can rise in our society
faster.

Not only faster, but more surely,
than by the tokenist advances pro-
moted by the Johnson administration
that hordon the deplorable antago-
nism between the races.

While Johnson supporters are pa-
rading at Goldwater rallies, trying
to demonstrate the Negro plight in
an undesirable manner, we of the
Goldwater camp are spending equal
time learning to know the Negro
and other minority groups. Through
this knowledge we learn to love our
fellow man. We reallze that you can-
not legislate lovei

Goldwater lor Rights

Let James Pryor and CORE know
that Mr. Goldwater is for human
rights, for property rights, and for
individual rights.

it is a great injusticethat any man
who has devoted his life to such high
ideals should be the object ofpickets
supposedly advocating those same
ideals — freedom for all!

Instructor Visits Child

In Present Day Czechoslovakia

“Everything you do in Czechoslov

by Cynth la Goodman

akia becomes a crisis," Mrs. Laszlo Palagyi

stated in describing the trip she took abroad this summer. A Speech and Drama

instructor at State
homeland.

Mr. Palagyi, a Hungarian,
sector of Hungary that was cede

Wllil an eloquent gesture, she
demonstrates: “Tire tears are al-
ways 5° Close", Tire way of life
there is so dlfferent,.Mrs. Palagyi
says somber‘ly, that no one can
understand without seeing.

Tire Comnrunist regime makes
itself felt everywhere. "Everything
is a mass advertisement for Com-
munlsrn and a condemnation of cap-
italism," Mrs. Palagyi asserted.

Every town is wired with loud-
speakers so that Pariy officials may
make announcements at any time
during the day or night.

The Big Dilleronce

There'ls no private enterprise
at all in Czechoslovakia as there
‘is in Hungary. Those who owned
their ot‘vn. businesses are now em-
ployees in their own shops, paid
by the State. The average salary
for the non-Communist laborer is
about $80.00 a month.

The Communists, who are gen-
erally the supervisors and mana-
gers of businesses, average about
$100.00 a month, but, Mr. Palagyi
asserts, every little bit helps.

From this salary, the worker
must buy everything. While neces-
sities like rent are relatively cheap
($8.00 month) luxuries like a tele-
vision set are large investments
for the average Czech. For a med-
ium-priced car, a Czech must work
about 20 years.

Initiative is so looking, says Mr.
Palngyl, that the only way to gain
a profit is to steal.

Mrs. P'alagyi described the state-
run churches in graphic terms.
First, the priests are considered
state employees and all money col-
lected in church is given to the state.
Masses and services are held on
Sunday nights and the memberships
are extremely low.

a . .:

University,

No Unemployment

Unemployment is non-existent be-
cause all workers are given work,
even though the salary must be cut.
lf 200 'workers are available, he
described further. and only 100 are
needed, the 200 will do half the work
for half the money. As a result, the
workers are becoming lazy.

The area of Kosice, the village
the Palagyis visited, is primarily
agricultural. This area is now com-
pletely co-operative and farm lands
are owned in common.

At one time, Kosice was a rich
wine-growing state. When the Com-
munists came in, they confiscated
the vineyards and distributed them
to Communists who knew nothing
about the art of making wine. Con-
sequently, the blighted land was
finally plowed under and given to
fodder.

Four Non-Co-Existence

Mrs. Palagyi commented at one
point that the Czechs both fear and
respect Goldwater. The Commun-
ist officials, in particular, fear
Goldwater’s determination not to
"co-exist" with the Communist re-
gimes.

An interesting story was told
about a Czech‘ girl who eventually
became a schoolteacher in Moscow.
As a girl of fourteen she had kept
a diary much like that of Anne
Frank, in which she recorded her
impressions of the initial Commun-
ist takeover.

When the Communists discovered
the diary. she was sentenced to a
concentration camp. Eight years
later, older and wiser, the mere
child had mended her ways and be-
come an instructor.

There had been bitterness in.

CHUHCHES ARE STATE operated, and priests are State em-
ployees. Consequently, church menrberships are very low.

she had accompanied her husband on a visit to his

had spent part of his childhood in Slovakia — the
d to the Czechs after World War I.

Czechoslovakia, but today, the Hun-
garian-Czechs had not lost the vigor
and warmth that characterize the
Msgyars.

When the summer was over, the
Palagyis returned, “WethankGod”
Mrs. Palagyi said, “that suchaplace
as the Free World exists.”

We met‘many wonderful people -
people who could laugh, joke, dance
v but-underneath, at least in most
cases, there is a despair —ahollow
memory of freedom. Among many
things, freedom is that thingyou feel
in the air when you return to the
Free World — hope."
