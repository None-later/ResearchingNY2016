Behind the glass doors near our
own Detroit Annex are located fa-
cilities for industrial shops, social
casework, a small store selling
hand-made goods, meeting rooms
for recreation and group work, and
offices which supervise distribution
of talking book machines, mobility
instruction, psychological guidance
and counseling, and a home visiting
service.

This is the Albany A'ssociatlonpf
the Blind at 301 Washington Avenue.
This organization serves me blind
and partially blind in the tri-city
area. What began as a social club
eventually evolved into a workshop,
and then into a service agency.

The emphasis at the Association
is that they are of the blind and
not in business for them.

Their charter specifies that 5 of
the ~21 people holding positions on
the Board of Directors must be
blind.

Legal Blindness

A person is considered legally
blind if he has 20/200 vision. lie
must be reported to the New York
State Commission for the Blind.
The figure signifies that he is only
capable of seeing at 20 feet, what
the normal person can see at 200
feet.

Referrals usually come to the
Agency from the medical field but
often individuals themselves seek
help. The staff of 22 very capable
people aid blind people“from cradle
to grave to adjust to normal living
patterns, communication problems,
mobility, education, recreation, and
rehabilitation problems" according
to Mr. Charles P. Jones, head of
social services.

Association Industries
Blind persons compete with
sighted people in certain industrial
areas. Properly trained employees
at industrial workshops in the Asso-
ciation are able to produce such
things as bakery trays, strainers
for boiling tar, educational toy

blocks. and handloomed rugs.

In addition, they maintainamono-
poly on chair-caning, which at one
time was thought to be the only job
blind people could handle. The work-
shop also has men employed on
machines doing beercase stitching
and stapling.

Both the machines used in these
operations and the sewing machines
in anotherdepartment have no spe-
cial gadgets to aid the blind people
working on them.

Partially blind men work on the
stitching machines to ensure safe-
ty. Women who are in most cases
totally blind operate the sewing
machines with a speed and accur-
acy that would amaze a sighted
person.

The Association not only gives
blind people hope in the field ofem-
ployment, but also keeps their rec-
reational organizations and facili-
ties moving at a fast pace.

Blind people bowl, play golf, swim,
play cards, and engage in most of
the other activities a sighted person
participates in. The only difference
is that the cards are marked in
braille, the reading language of the
blind, the bowling alleys have a
guide rail in line with the pins, or
the blind person is simply accom-
panied by a sighted person who acts
as his guide.

Blind "Read" Talking Books
The national and state govern-
ments have in some ways provided
for the recreation and education of
blind people. Ever since 1936 Con-
gress has appropriated money for
the distribution of talking books.

The Albany Association of the
Blind has distributed over 400 talk-
ing books and players in this area.

Reading “Gone With theWind” in
braille would entail pounds of litera-
ture since braille is printed on a
light cardboard. Talking books elim-
inate all the disadvantages of braille.
They consist of a series of records
made by professional readers, who
read a book or magazine from cover
to cover.

The Library of Congress will sup-
ply an individual with a record player
and his choice of over one million

books. Postage is paid by the gov-
ernment and mailing problems are
overcome by the use of acard which
tells the blind person that it is a
talking book.

Such literature as "Reader’s Di-
gest, "Holiday," “Times Review,"
and “Newsweek” are available. In
most cases the talking books are
only one edition behind. This allows
blind people to be well-informed on
current affairs.

Other concessions allowed blind
people include paying a single fare
for both the guide and the blind per-
son while traveling, and a double
deduction on income taxes.

Guldo Dogs Aid

Another aid to the blind is guide
dogs. A person may apply at aguide
dog school, such as the one at Peek-
skill, N.Y. and have about a one
month training session in how to
care for his dog, and how to cope
with the everyday problems he will
encounter in normal living proce-
dures.

The very old and very young are
not usually included in this pro-
gram because the elderly are not
usually capable of taking care of
their own dogs and the very young
are not ready to assumethe respon-
sibilities of owning a dog of their
wn.
Tuition of about $150 is charged
for the training session. No person

Student Protests letter
Written By Kennedy Foe

To the Editor: ~

Or should i say “To Mr. Dolly?”
Your letter concerning the journal-
istic assassination of Robert Ken-
nedy.

Sure, Robert Kennedy is good,
he’s real competent, but he is not
for New York. i cannot believe that
New Yorkers want a man repre-
senting them who lives in Virginia,
votes :in Massachusetts, and wishes
to be senator from New York.

As for his campaign - what has
been said against Keeling? Nothingl
Absolutely Nothing! Big deal — he
comes, out against Goldwater — any
Democrat can do that without en-
dangering his political position.

his objection to "Barry" that he has
conducted his campaign independ-
ently of the national ticket.

What has "Bobby" said in his
campaign speeches? What has he
promised? What can he do for New
York? The answer in all three cases
is NO a big fat N0 spelled N-O.
The only thing "Bobby" has talked
about is his late brother. Nothing
concerning the issues has been said.
How can a man like that win?

the Kennedy name. it's magnetic
believe me. Crowds storm him not
because they.want to hear what he's
saying but only to see a“Kennedy.”

In my opinion, Mr. Daily, the only
thing Robert Kennedy is aiming for
in this calnpaign is one big stepping
stone to a house on 1600 Pennsyl-
yanla Avenue. Sorry Mr. Dolly if
it shocks you.

is turned down because of financial
difficulties. Payments are arranged
with each student according to his
ability.

Certain organizations also aid
blind students to acquire a college
education. They will finance readers
for the student, and in some cases
even find him a home.

Services Not Complete

At present there are some gaps
in services for blind people. One
is in the field of recreation for
elderly people. Another is in the
homemnking area. A woman who
manages a home encounters many
hazards while performing house-
hold chores, especlully in the kit-
chen. These people must be properly
trained so that they can go about
their work safely.

Although blind people are handi-
capped. they are not lnvallds and
should not be treated as such.

Helen Keller pointedly claimed
once that “Not blindness, but the
attitude of the seeing to the blind
is the hardest burden to bear."

 

 

 

lay Tim Atwell

A bunch of the guys were whooping it upat the
W. T. last month. Such mirth few have seen the likes
of. Not since the golden days of Heorot had laughter
flowed so freely or guys felt so daring 'neath their
dermis.

The bravest and most hearty guy was Hans Bach-
mann — athlete, artist, Regents Scholarship winner.
Hails Is a German major, and Hans has it made be-
cause he’s bilingual. So Hans has a lot of time for
being jolly.

So Hans kept belting them down and singing, “O
Tannenbaum, 0 Tannenbaum...", for indeed was The
Spirit of an Old-Fashioned German Christmas nipping
the air. Hans Bachmann sat awash in aesthetic
jocundity, and it was only eight o'clock of a Friday
night.

Then up Jumped Sean Finnegan, bio major, to an-
nounce, “Mussa ick riden am bus su Hause vor tu
mock mein deutsch,” which loosely translated is, "I
must ride home on the bus to do my German.” Sean
is taking Ge-3 and he had to spend the entire weekend
looking up words in Langenscheidt’s.

The only free time he had was between five and
eight on Friday, and he spent it profitably at the T
with Hans Bachmann, Armstrong Robinson, and Eliot
Carabella, and their girlfriends.

Sean didn't have time for a girlfriend. He’d had a
girlfriend once, for about a week andahalf. Then Sara
(that was her name, Sara. Nice girl,Sara) said, “Sean,
it's either me or Langenscheldt's.” To which Sean
replied, "Was ken ick tu?" (“What can a good man
do?"), and went on his way, knowing it Would be at
least another year before he could have a meaningful
relationship with a member of the opposite sex.

50 Sean walked down to Partridge Strasse, and
caught a bus out to his dormotel (Door-muh-tell (ac-
cent on last syllable); neologism coined by a Mr.
Neil Webre, mathematician and physicist, and who am
i not to take the word of a mathematician and physi-
cist?)

Hans, Armstrong, and Eliot, and their girlfriends
just sat there for a good half hour after Sean left. The
Christmas spirit had been dispelled. llans said,
"Poor Sean. Two years of German, and he doesn't
know a thing. He’s not learning anything that way.
Poor Sean.” And everybody else said, “Poor Sean,"
also. It was unanimous. They ordered another round.

' Hahn-mam

 

And Hans spoke again. . ,  a

“it looks like l'm going to have to Start doing Sean's
homework for him.”

"Good idea," said Eliot. .

"Good idea," said everybody else. Except Arm-
strong Robinson. ‘ ‘ ’3'

“l've got this better idea," said Armstrong. “You
know Rheingold Pfennig?" (Indeed they did, for.it
was Rheingoid Pfennig who drank Harry "Fti‘pwate‘tli
MacFarland under the table at Yezzi's back in "63.)
"Well, I was talking to Rheingold the other day, and
he was telling me about how all the guys on his cor-
ridor keep asking him to translate their German
homework. They underline all these words they don't
understand and want Rheingold to write in the English
words between the lines.

"Now, Rheingold is getting a little ticked of! be-
cause he hardly has any time left to be jolly. So he
was thinking about charging these guys good money
for all this help he’s giving them. Well, Hans, if you
and Rheingold and Wolfgang Eckwelt and Kirkegaard
Montoya the half-breed got together, lbet you could
translate the whole Ge-3 reader in two weekends.
Pay some business majors to type up the stencils
and run them off, and then sell the translations at
twenty bucks a copy."

“You‘re thinking," said Hans.

And so it was done. And the supply ran out in one
hour and eleven minutes.

Hans, Rhelngold, Wolfgang, and Klrkegaard the
half-breed made two hundred dollars apiece and gave
Armstrong an equal share in the profits. Lucky Pierre
la Forge and Brigette du Bols teamed up to zeus
Larousse and make a cool fifteen hundred. Similar
rewards were reaped by the following: Moreili, di
Angelo, and Spezata; de Gama and Jaobim; Barcelona,
Morales and Ladonia Maria Elena Cantrill.

You will be happy to hear that Sean is passing Ge-3
and may even be learning something. Hans Bachmann
sings all the time. Armstrong Robinson made enough
to buy a rebuilt MG-TD. Eliot Carabella had no stake
in the goings on, but he’s happy to have a friend with
a rebuilt MG-TD.

On Fridays and Saturdays you can go to the 'l‘ or
O’Heaney’s or Yezzi’s and revel in the joy of modern
language majors and those fulfilling their language
requirements. And if you should bump into Sean Fin-
negan, say hello to his girlfriend Sara for me.

The world is a better place to live in now. And no
one was ever caught.

Candidates Agree on Basic Issues

When President Eisenhower re—
cently admitted that he could not
“define the issues” and was "con-
,fused” about this Presidential cum-
.paigu, he needn’t have felt alone or
embarrassed. He’s got a lot of
company.

Despite all
comes down to bare essentials.
there's little difference in the views
of the two candidates on the UN.
Both parties support the UN and
would press Russia for her back
dues.

UN Is Substitute
Goldwater goes one step beyond
Johnson, however, when he states

. . that the UN has not only abandoned

its original purposes, but further,
is becoming a substitute for
straight-forward American diplo-
macy.

In other words, Goldwater would
withdraw from the UN if to do so
would be in the best interests of
the U. S.

Since he 'feels the UN has fallen
victim to the Communist or allied
nations, Goldwater suggests a
weighted voting system according
to population.

The question of foreign aid, long
an issue between the two parties,
comes in for its share of the spot-
light.

Goldwater nssorts that aid was
originally designed to "bolster our
allies, not bribe our enemies." He

. challenges the administration's gifts
of wheat to satellite countries as
well as the USSR. Says Phyllis
Schlafy in her book “Choice Not An
Echo":

“While LBJ was turning out the
lights in the White House to save
a few dollars he was also turning
out the lights of freedom... by spand-
ing $44 million on wheat for the
Communist slavemasters."

But he does not stop here. lie
Proceeds to denounce the entire old
system as a fallacy.

asserts, are decided not by aid, but
by power.

The Democrats, who have tradi-
tionally supported high foreign aid

'progrmns, confine themselves to a

vague support of private enterprise,
and pledge to “help Asia, Africa,
(elc.) Innil:.ain conditions for free-
dom and lndependence....”

The question arises, when heur-
lng Goldwater’s arguments, as to
whether or not he would support the
UN specialized agencies which give
support lUlIlOSe“Sli-Cﬂlle(l neutral"
nations.

No Four to Negotiate

The Johnson Administration has
every appearance of continuing the
Kennedy attitudes on negotiation.
However, here Goldwater's argu-
ments get 21 little vague at best.

In his book "Why Not Victory?"
Goldwater states:

“They (summit meetings) must
fall for having achieved nothing, or
they must fall for having yielded to
the Communists."

lle, however, qualifies his remark
by saying later:

".... I emphasize my willing-

goals of peace and freedom are ad-
vunced.”

An interesting point of dissenslon
between the two candidates is over
appeasement.

Johnson stated upon receiving the
Distinguished Service Award from
the Capitol Press Club on May 18,
1963:

"i believe that half alonfis better
than none, but my acceptance is al-
ways conditioned upon the premise
that the half... is a step toward the
full loaf."

by J. Roger Lee

Those‘  rule our government '
under the present administration
are practicing a policy which
amounts " t‘o‘" calculated hypocracy.
The rhetoric of the Democratic
administration — theadministration
that: seekspowepvo'ver the state and
the individualig- proclaims the care
of the little man as'ita’g’oal. '

In practice, however, it is the
little man who is economically sac-
rificed in the headlong pursuit of
power to which the Democratic ad-
ministration is dedicated.

A progressive tax is a tax whose
rate is determined by a person's
ability to pay. Senator Goldwater
has rightly labeled this as a con-
flscatory tax, but both parties have
endorsed it as the desirable means
of securing government revenue.

Regressive Taxation

Not even Senator Goldwater has
suggested its repeal. The Demo-
crats, however, have reverted to
regressive taxation to finance their
gimmick programs. A regressive
tax is a tax levied as a straight
percentage of the money held by
an individual.

As is obvious, a poor man, with
little or no money above what is
required to keep his family’s life
and limb together, can ill afford to
lose say 10 percent of his wealth.

On the other hand, a'Johnson sup-
porter like Henry Ford, or even
Lyndon himself, could well afford
to part with 10 percent of his size-
able wealth and not notice the loss.

lnllatlon

This regressive capital tax and
the policy of imposing it on apeople
is the policy of inflation. It is pre-
cisely this policy that the Demo—
crats practice to pay for their pro-
gram of deficit financing.

A person's money is only as good
as the goods and services it can
purchase. The policy of inflation
is the policy of devaluatlng the
currency. ft is the consequent rise
in prices that represents the real
change in value.

dollars. The 10 dollars of lost pur-
chasing power did not cease tooxist,
it went to finance some scheme of
his government.

Power

The capital tax of the period from
1947-49 to present exceeds 55 per-
cent. That means the government
has confiscated 55 cents of every
person's dollar to finance its for-
eign and domestic programs. As
we have seen, this hurts the poor
more than the rich.

Here the process becomes es-
pecially pernicious. Each time the
government initiates a program to
“help the little man," it messes
more power for its bureaucracy,
power that once was reserved to
the people and the states.

By practicing a policy ofinflation,
the government creates serious eco-
nomic problems for the little man.
Then it amasses power to provide
relief.

Medicare

A perfect example of this hoax
is Social Security and Medicare.
The Social Security system was
initiated by the Democratic admin-
istration of_ Franklin Roosevelt so
that people, when they retired, would
have enough money to live comfort-
ably.

The inﬂationary policies of the
Roosevelt administration and those
that followed it, however, have
forced the price structure so high
that today. old people with their
Social Security holdings and other
assets reduced to 45percentoftheir
194749 value, cannot even afford to
pay their medical bills.

The consequence of this is that
Lyndon Johnson can ask for a Med-
icare bill which would extend gov-
ernment into the fields of medicine
and heallh insurance, in the name of
the little man.

Expanding Control
Today’s Democrats are not the
party of the little man. They are
the part of expanding government
control of all men.
Their rhetoric is contradicted by
their practice in which the little

If n person has a capital of 100
dollars, and the purchasing power
of the dollar drops 10 percent in a

effect is that the person has lost 10

man is just an economic pawn whose
welfare is to be sacrified toprOVlde
the statists with an excuse toamnss

pression of liberty.
