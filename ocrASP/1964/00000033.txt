Are audiences, as a group, and
the people who form them, indi-

vidually, really asinse‘nsitive,llardq -
‘ headed, and hard-hearted as they

seem? It very often seems so.
A case in 'l oint concerns “The

, Organiser." This excellent Italian

film concerns a rebellion of work-
ers in Turin against working 14
hours a day. They decide to strike,
and with the aid of a college pro-
‘fessor (The Organizer of the title)
do so.

The plot is sparse, but with many
vignettes and scenes that fill out
the story and give it life.

The picture is in direct line of
descent from the Italian nee-realist
films such as Rosseliini’s "Open
City" and de Sica's “The Bicycle
Thieves." Made in real places,
rather than studio sets, the films

I feature performers most of whom
‘ were non-professionals.

Sense of Reality

"The Organizer” has the sense
of reality that the best of these
films achieved. The recreaton of
turn-of-the-century Turin seams so
thorough and detailed, and the di-
rection is so sure of its material
and effects, that it often seems like
an extremely fine documentary..-

The main roles are taken by, pro-
fessionals, but they are so greatly
talented that they submerge the‘fr
recognizable personalities, and fit

justice. Bestr'ofr‘v'ally they are indi-
viduals, not they moulded, mass-
produced, idealized visages that
might be used To" 3 Hollywood film.

As the people are of lower class
and crude, there is a great deal of
earthly dialogue, much of it ex-
plicitly rendered in the subtitles.
There is also much — too.much —
bread, farcical humor.

When a horseshoe is thrown out
of a window for luck, it hits a
person standing below. This is in-
cluded just to keep audience inter-
est and to liven up the story.

Unnecessary Farce
But the story is already interest-
ing and alive, through the reality of
the characters and the exactitude
of the direction. Enough humor ger-

mane to the characters and situa-o

tions is used that such forced farce
is unnecessary and out of plee.

But the audiences eat it up. if
they enjoy it, let them; that is why
it’s there. They are also unable to
accept some of the expressions
used, without the laughter which,
apparently, results from their un-
easyness, at seeing in print what
is their common conversational
usage.

innards lWorse, viewers fail to dif-
ferentiate between comedy and
pathos.

The latter is "that quality of hu-.'

i

man experience which awakens feel-
"ings of pity and sympathy." True,
pathos is often inherent in comedy,
but it may also exist alone.

During afight between the strikers
and imported "scabs," the profes-
sor’s glasses are knocked off. Very
nearsighted, he can see very little
without them and so, in the midst
of the confusion, feels nervously
along the ground for them.

Frustratlng Moment
lt'is a frustrating moment, which
acutely “awakens feelings of pity
and sympathy.” It is definitely not
funny; nonetheless a large portion
of this Albany-opening-night aud-
ience guffawed condescendingiy.

Indeed, who do film-makers even
both to achieve depth of feeling
'When viewers will accept much less?
I‘v'Perhaps they are playing to aud-
Jences of sophisticated urbanites
and intelligent college students.

It could be, except that these
things occurred in Albany, which
should fill both requirements. No
doubt the audience left, having "en-
joyed" “The Organizer," but for
many it was like having read "The
Grapes of Wrath" for the sex and
smutty language alone.

AEIIIS 9n Stage

by Bruce Daniels'

"Twelfth Night" is generally

considered one of Shakespeare's
v most "delightful" plays. Last Fri-

day night's performance by the
Helen Hayes Repertory Company,
judging by the audience’s enthu-
siastic reception, certainly de-
lighted a great many in the Page
Hail auditorium.

Delight, however, is in the end
a personal response — and at the
risk of sounding like that kill-joy
Malvolio (who is the only discord-
ant element in the enchanged,har-
monious world of lllyria), [must
take exception.

if we must use the word, the
most “delightful” thing i have
seen in the past couple of years
is the French film “Jules and
Jim." in this film, the three prin-
cipal characters create a charm-
ing and seductive world that, for
all its lightness, is predicated on
the fullness of human experience
- including us ugliness and vio-
ience.

Illusion of Energy

"Jules and Jim" threatened at
any momem to become a somber
catalogue of human misery, but
dlrcclionul skill, superb acting
and the magnificentlilusionofvitnl
energy that pervaded the film,
triumphed over these dnrkor pos-
sibliilies.

it was just this element of lrl-
umph that Friday's plodlnlion of
"Twelfth Night" soron lacked.

Confused Dimenslons ‘

The characters that Shakespeare
created as one-dimensional (0r-
sino, Olivia and Sir Andrew Agne-
cheek) were played well; the char-
acters from whom we should ex-
pect more (Viola, Sir ’l‘oby Belch
and, especially, Feste)were played
one-dimensionally.

Richard Hamilton’s reading of
Feste was especially unsatisfying:
the Fool who is, in fact, the wisest
man and uncrowned king of lllyria
is played like George M. Cohan,
or some such song-and-dnnce man
whose sole function is to tickle
the masses.

Sir 'l‘oby’s affair with Maria
(and, indeed, much of tile comic
by-play) never quite came alive.
Jack Manning’s .Maivolio was a
polished performance but it, too,
appeared aimless.

The American Dream

 

 

by Robert Judd

"Time Magazine" reported re-
cently (August 21) that books by
Edgar Rice Burroughs account for
one-thirtieth of all U. S. paperback
book sales. The Burrough's rack
contains 24 Tarzan books and 10
Martian sagas, with combined sales
in the neighborhood of 10 million
copies annually.

The people who regulate the de-
mand for fiction today have become
so entangled in the reality which
they have helped to build, that es-
cape seems possible only through
mass-produced voyeurism. Litera-
ture has always provided an escape

idols were part of a folk process
which spontaneously generated tall
tales, demons, damsels, and heroes.
Today, the hero is mass produced
as well as mass consumed. No
'longer springing up from dragons'
teeth, the modern hero is created,
packaged, and sold to fulfill a need.
The surprising thing is that people
will buy it.

Building a Nightmare
Fantasy has become a craze in
tile twentieth century, similar to
the religious craze of the seven-
ieenth centllry. Man continues the
hypocrisy of craving a fantasy while
building a nightmare.

Mass education, an attempt to
Sophisticate tile intellect, cunnot
overcolne the desire of the moth
for the star, or of the mass for
tile star.

Elevated Idol

Rather than discover that the
idols of the primitive tribe had
feet of clay, we have merely put
shoes on tho idol and elevated him
to a now height.

li‘or man to create n hero is one
thing; it is another when a hero is
created for man. '

Fancy and fantasy are powerful
forces which should not be over-
lo ked even in a relatively sophis-

llélli'é'd Sooiuiy.‘ Bul'Thé"COnll'olled”

fantasy which today's people seek

runs counter to the fantasy of the
past.

Full Color Fantasy

Through literature, buteven more
through television and movies, fan-
tasy is sought. Television and
movies are even more popular than
books because no imagination is
needed for them. The fantasy world
is there, in hill color, with all the
details carefully given. We are only
asked to absorb, not to think.

The crowds which gathered at
court to hear aportion ofthe "Illiad"
read had to supply the visual part
of the story. Today that has been
done for us. (l would like to see
what Walt Disney would do with
“rosy fingered dawn" and "wine-
dllrk sea" to make it pnlntahle for
mass consumption.)

Dream Along with Freud

People are willing to lot (nay,
to pay) other people to dream for
them. This may have begun when
people discovered that Sigmund
Freud had more interesting dreams
than they themselves had.

Tarzan and the Beverly liillblllies
are, dubious forms even its outer-
tainment. When they become aneed,
however, a need which sends lliil-
lions of Americans on a quest for
escape, then we see that evolution
never transcended the ' ape-man
phase.

 

by Alex OoIItnl

In four short years Senator Barry
Goldwater has verbally bullied his
way into the limelight of American
politics. He has operated under the
assumption that the quickest and
surest way to gain public recognition
is to make a loud and belligerent
display of unorthodox beliefs.

The Goldwater "Blitzkrieg" was
initiated in 1960 with the publica-
tion of “The Conscience of a Con-
servative." In this slim volume of
dubious authorship two main issues
are discussed; first, the dangerous
expansion of the federal government
and second, the growing Communist
menace.

The author claims that the fed-
eral government has assumed far
more power than it was originally
intended to have by the founders
of the Republic. (That 180 years
have elapsed since the inception of
the Republic does not phase the

author).

Proposed Solutions
The proposed solutions to the un-
sanctloned growth of federal power
are as follows:
t a) Abolish the graduated income
ax

b) Abandon all farm subsidization

c) institute state “right to work"
laws

if) Relegate the problem ofschool
integration to the State legislatures
(Theo author claims that he is not
impressed that the Supreme Court
decision against public school seg-
regation is the law of the land.)

e) Abolish government welfare to
the needy (This is to be .the re-
sponsibility of private charity.)

The domestic policy being advo-
cated here has in large part been
absolute since the Civil War. The
author accuses the federal govern-
mellt of infringing on individual
freedom. This individual freedom
which is supposedly being thwarted

refers almost entirely to the prop-
erty rights of a few individuals.

Freedom from hunger, freedom
from racial discrimination and free-
dom from exploitation of one's is-
bor are not the concern of the
author. (They are of vital concern

to a majority of American citizens). -

Expandlng Communism

The second concern 'of the author
is the rapidly expanding Communist
menace. United States forelgnpolicy
is accused of being disorganized,
fainthearted and unrealistic in deal-
ing with the Communist world.

In order to effectively deal with
the enemy the U. S. must, first of
all, assume a policy designed to
achieve ' ‘total victory over the Com-
munists” (whatever that means).
It is proposed that the U. S. must
embark immediately upon the fol—
lowing policies:

a) Withdraw diplomatic regcogni-
tion from all Communist nations.

b) Declare ourselves opposed to
all disarmament agreements.

c) Seriously reconsider the wis- JUDY COLLINS m.

dom of remaining in the United Na-
tions.

d) Refuse to negotiate with all
Communist nations.

e) Give foreign aid to only those
nations that declare themselves
committed to our cause.

f) Do everything within our power
to encourage and aid “captive”
nations to revolt against their Com-
munist rulers. (Military interven-
tion is considered as a seriouspos-
siblity in accomplishing this end.)

Sketchy suggestion

The suggestions offered by the
author in "The Conscience of a
Conservative" are very sketchy.
In a later book, “Why NotVictory,"
Goldwater and his seventeen helpers
proceed to elaborate upon these
suggestions. Unfortunately, this ex-
panded explication of Goldwater's
foreign policy does not mitigate
the fact that ids views on world
affairs, if they are not patently ab-
surd, are at least extremely naive.
