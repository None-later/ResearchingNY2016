Frost Boaters lie Hudson Valley;
laiteau, Glaser Star in comeback

by Mike Forenell

Tony Glaser’s goal with
4:35 gone by in the final
overtime period enabled
State’s fresh to tie a strong
homestanding Hudson Val-
ley team 2-2, Wednesday.
in an away game.

Coach Scheffelin had a great deal
of praise for the entire team. Hud-
son Valley finished fourth in the
National Junior College soccer tour-
ney last year and the tie satisﬁed
Scheffelin.

Goalie Joe LaReau found himself
bombarded constantly during the
entire game as Hudson Valley at-
tempted 66 shots as compared to
State's six. LaReau picked off 30
shots and came up with 10 spec-
tacular and incredible saves.

Glaser had an extremely diffi-
cult task trying to cover the elusive
Manford Schuetze who had scored
Hudson Valley’s lead goal early in

the first overtime period.

With State trailing 2-1 going into
the last five minutes of the over-
time, the Peds went into action.
With a desperation press aiding,
Glaser found an unguarded net and
boomed home the tie score. Time
ran out before Hudson Valley could
mount an offense and the fresh had
a hard-earned tie.

The Feds take on the R.P.l. frosh
next Wednesday on University Field.

The lynno line on Sports

by Harold Lynne

Soccer Coach Joe Garcia has decided that the in-
clusion of modern dance steps in the calisthenics
drills of the soccer team will improve his booters
coordination and agility. Since coordination and agility

are very important aspects of soccer,

these drills

will probably prove worthwhile.

However, we feel that modern dancing is not the

answer to the soccer team’s problems. Two weeks ago,

in the Peds opening game

their greatest weakness w
an offensive attack. Slopp
of teamwork were the main

against Brooklyn College,
as an inability to sustain
y passing and the absence

reasons for the lopsided

defeat which the team suffered.
in the Brooklyn College game, the opposition was

able to dominate control of the
guided passing, whereas the State

ball through short,
hooters were kick—
losing the ball con~

tinually as a result of random passing. We hope to

see a decided improvement in

the soccer team’s

Rawe is presently playing his
fourth year of soccer at State.
This is his third year of varsity
ball. Fred made second team all-
state last year in only his third
year of competitive soccer. He did
not play soccer in high school,
choosing to run cross-country in-
stead.

Active in School Affairs

Even though he devotes many
hours a week to soccer, Fred still

fairs. lie served as freshman and
sophomore president, and is pres-
ently a member of MYSKANIA and
an officer in Sigma Lamba Sigma.

Fred’s favorite hobbies are skiing
and traveling, and working for his
fraternity. Fred is majoringin Eng-
lish, and balls from Alfred, New
York.

Ospina is strictly an Albany man,
living here and having attended Al-
bany lligh School. Luis is majoring
in French, and is also a member of
Sigma Lambs Sigma.

' Fourth Year of Soccer

Luis, now in his fourth year of
State soccer, did not play soccer
in high school, but played football
instead. in his two previous years
on varsity soccer, Lula has played

center forward and halfback, and is
now the team's right fullback.

Coach Garcia was very pleased
with Luis' performance in the
Brooklyn College game, especially
since the fullback is still inexper-
ienced in this position.

Luis' main interests lie in his
school work and in being active in
his fraternity. He was vice president
of SL8 last year.

Evaluating his co-captalns,Coach
Garcia said "Luis creates the bar-

Maurice ‘Tsododo booted a

Then, with slightly over seven
minutes having elapsed in the sec-

incredible indirect penalty kick.
Maurice lofted the ball over the
heads of Oneonta’s lined-up de-
fense, and past the vainly out-

For the next twenty-eight minutes
of action, defense prevailed. Both

For the next thirty minutes, both
teams pressed hard, trying to break
the long-standing tie.

As the tension molmted and play
became deliberate and cautious, the
climax was reached when State stole
the ball and headed for Oneonta’s
under-manned goal. After one shot
was blocked, Udo Guddat booted
home the winning goal with only
three minutes left to play.

State meets Potsdam tomorrow
at 2:00 in the annual Homecoming
game.

Peds Successful In

Past Homecomingsg

When the Reds play Potsdam to-
morrow afternoon, it will be the
12th annual Homecoming Game. The
first Homecoming Game was played
on October 31, 1953 when Albany
defeated Long Island University 5-0
and since that time the Homecoming
Soccer Game has become atradttton
at state.

The Feds have fared well in the
classic, posting a 6-4-1 record.
These games have always been wit-
nessed by huge enthusiastic State
crowds.

In 1959, a record crowd of one
thousand people saw the soccer
team trounce Plattsburgh 4-1. Two
years later, in a driving rain, the
boaters overwhelmed ‘Plattsburgh
7-0. Edwin Salmon led the offense
with three goals while goalie Gary
Penfield held Plattsburgh scoreless.

in 1955, Bridgeport gave State the
worst defeat in any Homecoming
game when they won 6-1. The
Bridgeport defense held the hooters
scoreless until late in the second
half when they yielded apenalty kick.

The game in 1960 against Oswego
ended in a 1-1 tie. The lone State
goal was scored by Karl Gersten-
berger, the only State player ever
to be named All-American.

The last two Homecoming Games
have been lost by a 2-0 score.

Following the formal portion of I

the program a reception and cdffee
hour will be held.

A panel discussion on the up-
coming British elections was spon-
sored by Forum of Politics last
Thursday night. Various aspects
of the elections, which will be held
October 15, were covered by Dr.
Lois Stone, Dr. Charles Ellinwood,
and Professor David Heal.

Professor Heal, a graduate of
Oxford University, England, dis-
cussed the issues in this election
from the British man's point of
view.

On the issue of foreign policy, he
said the Conservative Party is in
favor of a nuclear British deterrent
force which would give Britain the
right to attend nuclear disarmament
conferences. Labor supportsmixed
surface fleet plan.

The second issue concerns nation-
alism. Labor, which advocates a
planned society and limited Social-
ism, would like to reinstituie its old
nationalist programs.

Economy 0 Problem

The Conservative program, while
it supports free enterprise recog-
nized the need for a planned econ-
omy.

Wilson, a representative of the
intellectual wing of the Party, is
this year's leader of the Laborites.

Council Presents
llusic calendar

The Music Department ofthe State
University, in conjunction with the
Music Council will present its first
in a series of concerts on Friday,
October 16 at 1:25p.m. in Pagellall.

The entire concert program for
the year will include 12 concerts at
state.

Featured at the first program
will be Francis Foriier, a violinist.
Fortier graduated from Columbia
University and won a performance
diploma from the Juiliard School of
Music.

He is a student of Madame Irma
Zacharias, Roman Totenherg and
Joseph Fuchs.

The performance is open to all
State students and faculty without
charge.

When MacMillan fell ill this year,
the Conservative Party began squab-
bling and Lord Home emerged as the
Party leader. There seems to be
some feeling among the electorate
that some are “born to rule” and
others are “born to follow".

Heal speculated that unless the
situation changes radically before
the election, the Conservative Party
would win with a substantial ma-
jority.

Dr. Stone reviewed the Parties
involved in this election.

No Challenge

The .Labor party is disorganized
and has not offered a major chal-
lenge since it was ousted in 1951.

Dr. 'Ellinwood reviewed the his-
tory and nature of the Conservative
Party in Britain.

tion, the State University Revue will
hold its first meeting tonight at
8:30 p.m. in Brubacher Main Dining
Room.

Harry Guy, the Revue director,
has «emphasized that all interested
students should attend this meeting.
Many positions are open whichmust
be filled quickly. "Experience is
not necessary, only enthusiasm,”
he stated.

The Revue's main purpose is the
production of a full-scale musical
comedy in the spring. Pastprcduc-
tions have included "Kiss Me Kateﬁ‘
“Annie Get Your Gun," and “Once
Upon a Mattress.”

Three possible plays for this
year’s production will be submitted
for consideration at the meeting to-
night. Thc choices are "Fanny",
“Carnival”, and “lrma La Deuce."
Voting power is given to all those
who have worked on at least one en-
tire Revue.

Those not able to vote \villbe able
to participate in the discussion.

The new constitution of the Revue
was approved by Senate only last
Wednesday. However, there is still
no for mat election of officers.
Working with Harry Guy at present
are Cathy Farinon, Assistant Dirac-
tor. and Mary Setter, Musical Co-
ordinator.

in past years the llcvue was a
rather haphazard organization in
which a relatively few members
selected the musical, chose the
director, and filiedthe variousother
capacities involved in produotion.

new techniques in teaching langu-
ages in order to develop new theories
about the acquisition of language.

The lecture will include real hu-
man experiences Dr. Eson bed while
engaged in this study. Worthwhile
material pertaining to the recent
interest in reading skills and lan-
guage skills will be elaborated.

Ur. b’son, who came to Albany

the Orthogenic School of the Uni-
versity of Chicago, has had years
of study in the psychology of chil-
dren.

chologist at the Albany Child Guid~
ance Center and also asaconsultant

The Albany Chapter of the Amer-
ican Association of University Pro-
fessors is sponsoring this lecture.
Begun in 1959, the lectures are
presented by outstanding members
of the faculty.

The speaker is chosen by the
Faculty Lecture Committee which
consults with him in selecting a
topic for presentation. Dr. W. H.
Leue, president of the Albany Chap-
ter of A.A.U.P., notes that Dr,
