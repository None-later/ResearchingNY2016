.bespeaks to us that there are still Students in this
University capable of writing intelligently on what
they see about them. ‘
l The first issue was well thought out. It made lots
of sense and set a standard we hope will be main-
tained in weeks to come. It was a far cry from the
haphazard piece of pulp that died last February.
However, a bit of irresponsible editorship resulted,
we feel, in the insertion 0a a “poem” that was hardly
necessary. Does “suppression” think that it must
include such sentiment in order to be accepted by the
readership? Such a trite play of words offsets much
of the good that was presented by the revival.
When "suppression" went under, it left a void that
could not, despite the addition of an Arts Page, be
logically filled by student newspaper such as the ASP.
“Primer,” on the other hand, is far too narrow in
its scope to adequately handle the types of articles

 

 

‘_'l' guess we could have enieyed ourselves a little bit more it it wasn't such a "failure."

 The Mild-Ones on Wt

by David Childe

“First gear, it’s all right -
Second gear, lean right - Third
gear, hang en tight." This poetic
statement is easily recognizable as
a lyric from "Little Honda” de
Hondelles.

That popular-song is not only a stu-
pendous money maker but is also a
sociological breakthrough which has
helped to re-establlsh man's im-
pression of the two wheeled motor
vehicle. Thanks to Marlon Brando
and a post war generation of cycle
exhibitionists the United States fell
into a syndome of cycle hatred.

i am sorry to confess that my own
anti-deluvian parents threatened to
cast me from our castle if 1 pur-
chased a bike (jargon for motor-
cycle) this summer. Thus l,coward
that I am, must live in vicarious,
admiration of cyclists.

Blhoo Behind Draper

My idolizatlon drew me to the
faculty parking lot behind Draper
Hall where several dozen bikes are
parked each day. These were not
peddle pushers which the sensitive
sweethearts suffoc ate Skldmore
with. Not so, for i knew that atop
each brilliantly colored power pac-
kage must exist an individual of
incredible spirit and daring, a man
who was risking his life and social
reputation each time he launched
into the vicious Albany traffic scene.

To steady my devilish nerves 1
chatted with Officer Fischer, the
parking lot attendent. He reassured
me that all of my heroes were mere
human beings and that their only via-
lation was to occasionally block one
of the few parking areas.

Helmoted Director
My initial contact was with Fred
Beagle who directs a 1984 All State

Vespa. Though he stressedthe rock
stability of scooters, he nonetheless
admitted to wearing a helmet and to
having had three minor mishaps
since his purchase in May.

He rejected the idea of owning a
car by pointing out that his 3355.
machine gave him 'over one hundred
miles per gallon and cost him fifty-
one bllls for insurance. linothing
else, he said, it was the best lure
for catching dates as girls found
celestial release‘during flights on
bikes.

The next advocate of the two
wheel drive was Charlie Keese of
Cobleskill. He is said to have been
the only cyclist on campus last
year and this explains his having
the best cycle in the lot. His three
hundred-five cubic centimeter, 1962
Honda is a handsome blue stallion
of graceful strength.

Dike for Sale

His large stead delivers up to 110
mph, seventy mpg, but eats up two
hundred in hay insurance a year.
Now languishing with his companion
at his Country Squire estate,with an
attractive brunette at his elbow,
Charlie announces that he is willing
to part with the bike for four hundred
dollars. Success must have gone to
his head.

Another lucky dare-devil has
found a partner in his danger. Jim
Monte is now awaiting delivery of
his 1965 Lambretta-l50 with his
financier and co-pilot, Judy Gel-
burd. This instrument milks only
eighty-five dollars in insurance,
and JAF Motors, his agent, assures
Jim over one hundred miles per
gallon on his $439. purchase.

Next summer, Jim plansto return
the bike home, to Europe for a cul-

ltl Two:

ture tour. it appears that one vision
leads to another.
Exceeds Cor Economy

Louis Ospina fell into owning his
Honda - 90 when he was in Cape
Cod this summer as he picked it
up for 3 0'5. Though he would enjoy
a car, he finds the bike far more
economical - no parking problems,
only $120 for insurance, and the
camel thirst for fuel.

He will, nonetheless, part with it
for three hundred dollars or sug-
gests a Vespa-150 for $175, which
he knows is up for grabs.

Shirt Troilic Joins

The sport and speed of bikes is
obvious but their aid in huntingor as
a wage earning delivery cart throws
new insight into cycle advantages.
John claims to have no traffic wor-
ries as he can skirtstailedjams like
a fish in water.

Having a stable of bikes, he is pon-
dering buying Keese’s Honda and
selling his scooter - with a record
112 miles per gallon - for three-
hundred-twenty five dollars.

The greatest prophet of cycles
was John Rodd, a freshman from
Colonie. Since age thirteen he has
been tooling with bikes and now owns
a Lambretta-125 a '62 Yamaha,and
a '56 Harley Davidson. He has won
trophies at scrambles such as
Duanesburg, has raced on the ice of
Lake George, and has cleared a two
Hundred pound deer from the woods.

It may be a young man‘s yearning
to return to the saddle and range
or a blast at conforming civiliza-
tlon but the rise in bike riding here
on campus indicates their greater
incidence in the future. Yet there
still remains those callous blind,
like the coed i saw who walkedpasi
the bikes and said of a shriveled-up
rusty red M.G.,‘ “l'd luv to have one
of those."

that are “suppression’s” life-blood.

Free expression is the essence of University life.
“suppression” provides a means of free expression
for the individual student that is really without equal
in the University. A lack of editorial responsibility
seems to have been the main source of difficulties
with “suppression” in the past. Without such respon—
sibility, it is impossible to build up the student in-
terest in the publication that is needed for its sur-
vival. . ,

The new editors we hope will grasp this truth. As
they wrote, Friday, “suppression” exists only when
there are students who care enough for it to exist.

lgthnical liurlt Faulty

seems we were a bit premature in judging Home-
coming Weekend a failure. In spite of early slow
ticket sales, nine hundred people finally attended
the concert, and eight hundred, went to the formal.

Homecoming was not a complete success, however.
The performers at the concert were enjoyable, but
the handling of lights and technical equipment did
much to mar their appearances. The coronation of
the Homecoming Queen was also spoiled by bad
lighting.

This is not the first time that bad technical work
has ruined an otherwise good performance. At the
UCA All-University Concert at the beginning of the
year, trouble with the speakers ruined the first
performance and during the second, one of the per-
formers had to ask to have the lights changed. This
also occurred at the concert Saturday night.

We feel that there is no need for this type of
faulty work. If students are not capable of operating
equipment properly. then professionals should be
hired,.but guest artists, as well as students who pay
for these performances, deserve to have technical
conditions at their best.

forum (liters opportunity

The Forum of“ Politics reception for foreign stu-
dents tomorrow night offers a chance which should be
taken advantage of for becoming acquainted with these
students.

Foreign students are too often isolated within the
campus community and the tremendous opportunity
for learning about them and their countries is lost.

These students have taken the first step by con-
senting to tell of their countries at this reception.
It’s up to us to take the next.

This naturally means that some-

Seuate replacement elections al-
ways are followed by a few blasts
ilt Election Commission. Keeping
with the tradition, I now add this
one to posterity and the ‘round
file."

This protest centers on the bal-
lots themselves, rather than the
usual procedural targets.

The ballots were disorganized,
frequently sloppy and improperly

cut. On the ballot on which 1 voted,
the bottom of one list of candidates
was at the top.

it Was followed by the elections'
title, the directions, and the top

of another list of candidates. Two
names from the upper list were re-
peated on the lower.

ballot'(s) did not include these or
other names at all.

This was compotmded by the poor
typography. One candidate's name
was totally illegible. Another's
name was nearly so. Only a knowl-
edge of those running and logical
deduction allowed me to decide for
whom the blurs stood.

The se improprietles, although
they were undoubtedly accidental.
are despicable, unfair to the can-
didates, and undemocratic.

i request that they pelnveatlgated
and corrected, if not in thlaelection,

in future balloting.

I Changes in 'school colors and
traditions were proposed at last
Friday’s Athletic Advisory Board
meeting. Merlin Hathaway, head
of the Athletic Department, sug-
gested that the team be given an “an-
imal” name, thus establishing at the
same time a new school mascot.

Another proposal came from Dr.
' Ralph Tibbetts, a board member.
He suggested a Dutch name for the
team because of the Albany area's
background.

. . The discussion turned to the

Wednesday. The question was
whether high school or college

Hathaway pointed out the difference
between the two styles: high school

PAT FASANO, HOMECOMING Queen

class. The Queen's Fleot led
took place.

The crowning of Miss Pat Fasano
as Homecoming Queen 1964 began
the week-end festivities Friday
night. Miss Fasano was sponsored
by Kappa Beta, and reigned over
the week-end’s events.

Daralene Delio, Mary Margaret
Walker, Lana Everett, Barb Town-
send, Dottie Watson, and Nancy
Baumann became the Queen's at-
tendants. The Queen and her court
were voted upon in elections by the
entire'student body last week.

The crowning preceded a folk
concert at the Washington Armory.
The concert featured Judy Collins

and the Modern Folk Quartet. Miss
Collins appeared firstand presented
a variety of songs covering many
eras and sentiments.

Utilizing a style quite different
from the one used by Miss Collins,
the Quartet then provided apowerful
rendition of several folk songs,plus
recent songs of political satire.

in the Homecoming Parade Satur-
day, Beta Zeta took first prize with
lts float, "Drag ’Em Feds”. The
float depicted a Ped player in a fast
racing car pulling ahead of a Pots-
dam man on an old-fashioned bi-
cycle.

Thc answer to this and many morc

of the most urgent questions in
American life today
will be found in

a new non book by David Newman & Robcrt Benton,

designed by Milton Glaser

and fearlessly published by The Viking Press.
