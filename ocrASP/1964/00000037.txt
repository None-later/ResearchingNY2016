Harriers Trounce New
Haven, Robinson First

Placing six men in the first seven to finish, the
varsity cross country team scored a 17-47 victory
over New Haven State College last Saturday, on the

Connecticut school’s course.

Tom Robinson won in

sixteen minutes. twenty-three seconds (16:23) fol--
lowed by Dennis Tuttle (16:45) and Bob Flick (16:46)

who were two steps apart.

New Haven’s Bob Da-
inutz took fourth place win
16:52. Ken Darmer. John,
Clark. and Ken Kirik fin-
ished fifth, sixth, and sev-
enth respectively. Leahy
of New Haven was eighth
and Fed Jake Johnville
ninth.

Second Place Close

The second place position was
very closely contested: Damutz,
Tuttle, and Flick pressedeachother
throughout the race until a half
mile from the finish where, on a
steep hill, the Albany runners took
a commanding lead.

Bob Flick was Tabbed by Coach
Keith Munsey as State's "Runner of
the Meet" for a “fine, determined
race." Dennis Tuttle, who set a
steady pace throughout the race,
was highly praised as was Ken
Darmer who came in "a strong
fifth."

Coach Munsey singled out Ken
Klrik, who according to the coach,
"ran a very good race and is ap-
proaching a pro-season form after
an operation which kept him out of
action for over two weeks."

Tenth Straight Win
The varsity win was the third
this year and is the tenth dual
meet victory in a row for the Peds
over a two year period. Following
the meet Tuttle and Robinson were
voted co-captalns.

Tomorrow the barriers will com-
pete in a triangular meet with RP]
and Siena to be held on the Engineer's
4.7 mile course in Troy.’ This will
be the second year the three schools
have met. State won the 1963 meet
with 32 points followed by am with
41 and Siena 54.

The meet will also be scored as
two dual meets for each team and
on this basis the locals also won
last \year; the Feds defeated RPI
24-31 and Siena 23-35. The only
comparative score this year is the
20-39 Albany win over Siena two
weeks ago.

Frosh Loss to Cohleskill

Despite Joe Keating's first place
finish, the fresh were defeated
Cobleskill last Saturday in an away
meet. The Aggies team depth proved
to be the decisive factor in the
23-36 loss; Cobleskill placed five
men in the first eight runners.

Keating, a graduate of St. Mary's
of Glens Falls, took the lead at the
outset of the race and held it through-
out the 3.2 mile course to win 16:
23. This was the fastest time re-
corded over the Cobleskill course
this year.

Coach Munsey commented, “the
real damage was a sweep of second,
third, and fourth by Cobleskill run-
ners Jim Henderson, Ken Walther,
and Paul Wood." They were followed
by Doug Bellenger and John Tice who
captured sixth and seventh for the
Aggies.

Grant Downs was the second Al-
bany man to finish as he placed
fifth.

' r , '3 before a homecoming crowd of approximately athousand enthusiastic
ans, State’s. determined» Peds dropped a hard-fought and well-played 1-0 contest
to Potsdam College last Saturday. State’s defense was outstanding as host of the
action was forced into Potsdam’s half of the field. However. the booter's offense
couldn’t overcome Potsdam’s swift and rugged defense, as the winner’s goalie,
BarryMachlus. played a sensational-game to hold the Peds scoreless.
V  ' ~ v » "r s The game was-playedun-
' A der an overcast and omin-
ous sky with a drving wind
lacing the field and making
the bitter coldness even 0
more biting.

For most of the first half, the
.contest was scoreless as both of-
fenses seemed unable to conquer
the wind and coldness to put to—
gether many effective attacks on the
goal.

However, with just four minutes
remaining in the first half, Potsdam
was awarded a corner kick after an
Albany defensiveman deflected the
ball over the end line. As the kick
descended in front of the goal, Pots-
dam gained control,and forward Bill
Whitehouse booted in what proved to
be the only tally of the game.

The third quarter was a duplicate
of the first half, as both squads were
offensively inert and play settled
down around the midfield stripe.

The fourth session was dominated
by State. The offense was able to
sustain several strong attacks
toward Potsdam’s goal. But luck
wasn’t with the Feds as one shot
was barely too high, and another
booted directly at the goalie. Mach-
lus only made eleven saves, but at
least five of those were “sure”
scores.

Maurice Tsododo was again the
team’s offensive mainstay, despite
being double-teamed by the oppon-
ents. Tsododo did manage to get off
several shots at Potsdam’s goal,
but was unable to push any past
Machlus.

Fred Rawe, Len Bergen, and Lu-
is Ospina played standout defensive .
ball, allowing only fifteen shots tobe
taken at Albany’s goal. Goalie Ron
Hamilton made nine saves for the
Pods.

State now sports a 1-2 record and
faces R.P.I. tomorrow night under
the lights at Bieecker Stadium.

Students Speak of Native londs

At Forum of Politics

Topics ranging from government
to civil war were among the many
dlscussed by foreign student guest
speakers at the Forum of Politics
Reception Wednesday evenng.

The speakers were Mohammad
Yedegnrl from Iran, Cecilia Gui-
dote from the Philippines, Timothy
Wanjala from Kenya, and Maria
Georgiopoulos from Greece.

Mr. Yagadi talked on political
trends in his native Iran. He began'
wlth a brief discussion of Persian
history, pointing out the nation's
continued support of a monarchy
over the last 2500 years.

Today, however, through further
land reforms and increasing free
elections, the people, led by the
monarchy itself, are attempting to
strengthen their slx-year-old de-
Inocl‘acy.

lrnninns have tasted democracy
for short periods of little at the turn
of the century and again after World
War II, but each time it has been
supprcsed by ilnperiaiistic coun~
tries.

Presently, under the leadership
of the Shah, a revolution is under-
way to establish a government sim—
ilar to that of Great Britain, a con-
stituiional monarchy.

Cecilia Guidote, u Fulbright
scholar from the Philippines, also
spoke on her country‘s political
developments. ‘

She emphasized the similar gov-
ernments of the Philippines and of

the U. S. Both have a Senate, a
ilouse of Representatives, and two
political parties.

The proposed East African Fed-
eration was the subject of Mr. Wan-
]ala's talk. Uganda, Tanganyika, and
his native Kenya, which already
have one standard communication
system, one monetary system, and
interlocking heritages, are attempt-
ing to unite into one nation.

With one government rattler than
three, he believes the country will
run more smoothly economically as
well as politically.

Maria Georglopoulous of Greece
spoke of the (‘lVll war that went on
in her country immediately follow-
lng World War If. She mentioned
that the Allies were unconsciously
supporting the Communist rebels
when giving aid to repel the Axis
powers.

Her talk concluded the formal
part of the program, which was
followed by a coffee hour.

Senate Meets T inurday

Senate was forced to hold a
special metlng last night when
the regular meeting Wodnalday'
