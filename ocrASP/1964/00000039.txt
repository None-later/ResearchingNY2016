 ' The only path such apathy can lead to is an eventual

inturn, is reﬂected in the attitudes that .the student'

If the job requires of a senator goes beyond the
logical boundaries of his time and talents, then he
. should recognize the impossibility of his continuance
in his post and resign in favor of someone who might
be able to contribute more time and effort to Student
Association projects. There have been many such
cases of over extension in the past, and probably
,will be more in the future. If the discrepancy is
recognized and properly dealt with, then no loss
results.

When. however. inactivity is allowed to become
part of a senator’s schedule without rectification,
then the general lack of enthusiasm which follows
is a felony to be classified under moral negligence.

Hangings Apportionment Unfair

e program of Regents Scholarships has
helped many students to defray much of their college
expense the method of determining annual wards is,
in many cases, quite unfair to individuals.

The award is determined on the basis of parental
income, or, in other words, on the basis of how much
money the parent can reasonably be expected to con-
tribute to the cost of college. It does not take into
account how much the parent actually does contribute,
whether the money is reasonably available or not.

This has the effect of discriminating against the
very students who need the most aid — those who do
not receive financial support from, or who are in-
dependent of, their parents.

Even students who are married and have completely
left their parents’ household must base their award
on their parents’ earnings. However, many parents
feel, and rightly so, that when a husband and wife
establish their own home they should assume the
responsibility for their own finances.

Thus students who, for one reason or another,
have assumed the full burden of the cost of their
education. find themselves in effect penalized by
the very program set up to help them.

We trust that some more equitable way can be found
to distribute scholarship funds to those who really
need them.

Keating Called

'Small—time Politician'

To tho Editors:

Or sllould i say to the “01’
Shocker" - Mr. Farley Micllaelsou
— the "angry young man” whose
enlightening anti-Kennedy for Senate
comments appeared in lastFriday's
ASP.

To quote you, Mr. Mlchaelson -
“sure Robert Kennedy is good, he's
real colnpetent but he is not for
New York.” The remainder of the
paragraph from which thisquotation
is taken, clearly indicates your be-
lief that, in spite of Kennedy’s com-
petellce, he sllould not be elected
because he is a supposed carpet-
hugger.

I ask you: Now can such unaccu-
sation be justified when members of
the Kennedy family have been New
York State taxpayers for years and
have attended scllool here. in addi-
tion, it seems logical that a com-
petellt politician: Would he well-in-
formed album the political issues of
the state that borders his own.

As for his campaign speeches, the
reason Kennedy hasn’t said mllcll
against Keating is not because Keat-
lllg has such a flawless record, that
Kennedy is afraid to challenge him.

That is hardly the case, when
a national figure is running against
a small-time politician. Kennedy
has made it known that his present
interest is running for the office
— not against the man. 'l‘oease your

at such osprlslionl

mind, however. Kennedy and Keating
have tentatively agreed to engage in
a series of debates.

As for Keating coming out against
Goldwater, a fellow Republican, now
I say Big Deali I seriously doubt
that Keating ls endangeringhis"Po-
litical position” when some of the
party leaders have also criticized
Goldwater and much more positive-
1y.

lll reply to your questions which
were. in effect — Has Kennedy prom-
ised anything? Can he accomplish
anything? My answer, Mr. Michael-
son, is yes, a big fat Yes - spelled
Y-E-Sil

My reasons for making this state-
lnent are certainly not unfounded.
Kennedy promised ill a recent canl—
paign speech, which lwas privileged
enough to hear, that if elected, he
would make New York truly an
Empire State.

1 really think he can make his
prom'se materialize. Let’s face it;
he's a national figure and he’s got
political pull.

Granted, he is probably using the
office as a stepping stone, but this
is another reason why he will do a
good job. He must. lie is being
watched and tested as a possible
candidate for the highest office ill
the land. In this connection I do
not consider Kennedy’s running for
Senate an insult to the people of
New York, but an honor.

He is llotthe small-timepollticlan
who would do nothing but introduce
pork-barrel legislation around re—
election time. He is ambitious,
competent, powerful and to quote
you again, Mr. Mlchaelson, he has
"the Kennedy name. We magnetic,
believe me.”

Therefore, Mr. Mlchuelsoll, coll-
sidel' the issues. is pride or your
state more important?

For Enlightened Editorial

To the Editors!

We would like to commend the
editorial staff of the ASP for the
extremely perceptive editorial
which appeared iii the issue of
October fl, liliiil.

We found lilo views expressed
therein, particularly those which
pertained to the void left by illvnl-
l'y and to the llll'lllﬂiS, truly stimu-
lating. The decadent, pool'lyorgan-
txed University events to which you
refer ili‘e certainly ill need of a
grant deal of criticism.

Your constructive suggestions for
the hotlol'lllellt of these events are
indeed pl‘uisowortlly. However,
since your proposals south so oh-
vtous and realistic, it is difficult to
comprehend why no ono has ex-
pressed them before.

Certainly no one can dispute the
ameliorations which you have so
precisely outlined. Your clever -
and apparently original - theory
that immediate change is the ulti-
mate answer to the problems which

plague this community represents a
veritable Renaissance of tllought in
the tradition of the great thinkers of
the Enlightenment.

Your impeccable logic has ull-
doubtedly influenced any intelligent
reader to agree with your proposed
programs, and the rational yet im-
aginative proposals that you have
formulated impressed us.

Furthermore, we are certain that
your strong support of illese events,
despite their blatant weaknesses,

encouraged people to participate ill

the activities of the past weekend.
We hope that in the future you
will continue to point out to the stu-
dent body ways oi improving the
social welfare of this university
community.

Self Respect Vital
in Current Elections

To the Editor:

There has been much discussion
of the political issues involved ill
this year's presidentiui election.
Rehaslling these is something I will
leave to others.

There is a far lnore important
question to be considered than Social
Security or the Supreme Court -
the question of our self-respect as
American citizens.

This is not merely a contest be-
tween Johnson and Goldwater; it is
a far more vital struggle between
the fear of power and the power of
fear.

in the past years ollr country has
becoule trapped ill a maze of medl—
ocracy. Not only is our government
losing the respect of other nations,
but also and even worse- it islosing
the respect of Americans.

The tillle is here when we must
chose between security and super-
iority. We need ll strong man, ll
man not entrenched ill the subtle
philosophy of the sixties- the philos—
oplly of compromise.

We need a man who (‘ﬂll set
aside fear and help to rebuild ll
nation whose strength demllllds both
fear and respect from the notions
of the World.

And, in my opinion, this man is
Barry Goldwater. Dol recollllllclld
devastating war? Certainly not,
but neither do i want ll degrading
peace.
1 Our country is a great one, hllt
it can only remain so through ll
willingness to protect our ideals
and, if need he, fight for our ballots.

l’ln afraid our world is not built
all brotherly love, and we i'llllllill
afford to indulge lll ldoullstll: trust
ill the good will of other buttons.

This is ll fast-moving world ulld
we lllllst move fast if we are to
survive in it. For this we head
strength and this is what Goldwutcr
offers us. ill return, I'm willing to,
offer him my support.

'Dr.

Marlowe’s

Production of

‘F austus

Emphasizes ‘Theatreness"

by Dr. Jorko Burion

The use of a cathedral for
poses in the presentation of

phenomenon today, but

stage and auditorium pur-
a playisa relatively rare

in certain circumstances,
achieves a unique aptness.

T. S. Eliot’s “Murder in

the Cathedral” is a script that was specifically writ—

dimension and power when
staged in church surround-
ings. One such is “Dr.
Faustus.”

Its intensely spiritual
theme of the salvation and
damnation of the soul finds
obvious reinforcement in
church context.

Spiritual Issues Underlined

Moreover, at the same time that
the cathedral setting underlies the
spiritual issues of the destiny oftlle
soul, it ill no way detracts from the
equally universal, ever-contelllpor-
ary, but more secular theme relating
to the limits to be imposed on man’s
aspirations and materialistic
achievement.

A product of the Ellzahethlan
age, Faustus is a dynamic, vivid
play that allows for a variety of
interpretations and modes in stag-
ing; it has been produced ill the
past ill styles ranging from the most
realistic or llluslnnisric to the most
eccentric, unorthodox, and theatri-
cal.

The particular nature of much of
the action, involving as it does hu-
man, supernatural, and internal
characters, magical occurrences,
and a narrator-like chorus, pre-
sellts a distinct challenge to botll
director and designer, and all the
more when the play is to be pre-
sented in a cathedral.

Theatrical Emphasis

This particular production will
attempt to emphasize the theatri-
cal characteristics lllllerellt ill the
script by the use of such elements
as masks, suggestiveness rather
than detailed historical accuracy ill
costumes, frank acknowledgment of
the audience, primarily non-illu-
slonistic scenic effects, and a broad
and deliberately heightened style of
acting in botll vocal delivery and
movement.

Furthermore, both the physical
and intangible properties of the
immediate surroundings —- the
cathedral -— will be used when and
where dramatically or thematically
appropriate.

The emphasis will be on the main
line of the action and on the larger
thematic implications rather than
on the subtleties or refinements of
character; similarly, the staging
will emphasize the theatrclless of
tile performance by elllpluylllg ll
series of lluutl‘fli levels and plut-
forms that localize tholllselves by
the presence of a few props or
merely by the dialogue of the per-
lill‘lilel‘h‘.

Presentation in to to Audience
In Tradition of luuring lrnupes

by Debby Friedman

“The feeling of the Ben—
aissance rather than his-
torical accuracy willbe the
aim of the production of
Marlowe’s ‘Dr. Faustus’,”
said Mr. Jay Moore, who
is in charge of the play’s
set design.

This will he as a result of the
elnploylllellt of the technique of tile-
atrlcal presentation. Tile actors
will he the lnost important point
of emphasis willie the setting will
ie suggestive.

Dramatic Form

A nlore drumut c than realistic
form of production can make a play
like "Faustus" clearer. Therele
he an attempt made to have the
audience look into and he a part
of the play instead of looking at it.

in order to effect this more eas-
ily, the audience will be seated
ill a semi-circle.

The play’s audience will have
lll ore freedom' of interpretation
based on the ideas and symbols that
will be introduced.

However, to produce these sym-
bols in the Cathedral of All Saints,
several problems have been en-
countered by Moore. The actual
scenery to be elllployed is simple,
but to bring into use modern tech-
niques of theatre lighting in a cn-
tlledrul, structural prohiellls must
be overcome.

Lighting is the best tool of eul-
pllusis the theatre has, especially

for controlling moods.

Acoustical Problems

There is also a problem ofacous-
tics in the Cathedral of All Saints.
With the reverberation from the
high ceiling. words are hard to
understand.

This height can be an advantage
as well as a detriment; Height has
a tendency to place a play ina space
by itself. Tile structural set-up
adds to the dralnalics of the play.

Tile problem of scenery is being
overcome in part by flaring the
actors carry various sets on the
stage and erect them. This is
similar to the lnethods used in the
touring companies of Marlowe‘s
time.

Also a parallel tollle Renaissance
theatre character is llle use of the
cathedral itself. Touring compan-
ies of the are used cathedrals and
other open areas for performances.

Revelation of Changes
Tile idea of cathedral spacious-
lless and carrying scenery oul onto
the stage is to help the audience
accept the point of view of the
play. it is a revelation of changes
in tile play using no tricks.

it has been found Ill the theatre
that an audience will accept any
sryle of presentation as long as
it is consistent.

This production of “Dr. Faustus”
will tie in with the Renaissance

of tile theatre of that age. the
