Denny Phillips snared three and
Fred Cuibert, two.

. Potter took a quick two point
lead early in the first quarter when
Masaculo blocked a KB punt in the
end zone for a safety.

Early in the first half, Culbert
ran back an interception twenty
yards to paydirt. Potter's second
score came via a Wayne Smith to
Dave Sully play covering twenty-
five yards.

Just before the half ended, Cul-
bert picked off another misguided
pass and ran it back twenty yards
to the thirty yard line. This time
it was Ray Weeks on the receiving
end of a Smith scoring strike to
put Potter twenty points ahead at
the half.

Smith hit Weeks again in the
second half lor Potter’s final score,
the play covering forty-five yards.

Chuck Connolly also breaking the
old record with a time of 25:36.
RPl's ,Barry Stepp grabbed third
in equaling the old record.

The race for team honors was
even closer than that for first place
laurels, as a pair of upset stomachs
and a fall nearly cost State the meet.

Albany’s reliable Dennis Tuttle
ran into painful muscle cramps in
the last mlle—and-a-half, forcing
him to slow down and trip and fall
as he did so.

He was able to recover, however,
and nailed down fifth in the race.
Even though this was the lowest he
has placed in two years of competi-
tion, it was enough to clinch the
meet for State.

State lost Kenneth Kirik midway
through the race as he became
nauseous and was forced to drop
out. Kirik, who had run a fine race
against New Haven last Saturday,
had been counted on in the meet.

Robinson’s effort earned him the
team’s “Runner-of—the—Meet”
award from Coach Munsey, who
stated, “It was obvious that Tom
was running under'a real strain
during the race. He had to curtail
several practice sessionslast week,
and he was just great today.”

Scoring two goals late in the final
period, RPl gained a thrilling 4-2
victory over State's frosb soccer
Wednesday on University

Field.

The goals, scored by
Taik and Sid Abrahams, wiped out
a 2-2 tie which had been set up for
State by Garry Swartout‘s third-
period goals. The RPl two goals
were scored within two and a half
minutes of each other and left the
Feds little time to mount an offeri-
slve.

The game started off at quite a
slow pace; neither team scored dur-
ing the first half of” play. The action
shifted from one end of the field to
the other with neither team sus-
taining an offensive drive.

The third period was quite dif-
ferent; liPl started right off with
' a goal, but State's Swartout came
back With two scores. ills first
goal was scored on a penalty kick
with 12:49 gone by in the third
period. A minute later be scored

In the fourth period ltPi, pres-

RPI Nips Soccer Team
‘2-0 in Overtime Period

by Ray McClooi

Losing its momentum and drive in the two over-
time periods, State’s soccer team dropped a heart—
breaking 2-0 contest to rival R.P.I. last Wednesday
night at Bleecker Stadium. State overpowered R.P.I.
for the majority of the regulation time.

Albany’s offense took
thirty—one shots at the goal
but couldn’t push any past
R. P. L’s John Cassarino
who had nineteen saves in
the game.

During the early stages of the
game both teams were hindered by
the dusty playing field and cool
night air. RPI opened up with sev-
eral long shots that_were easily
handled by State’s goalie Anton Sa-
lecker.

iﬁildr

 

The Ped’s then began to move
offensively, getting off several shots
that narrowly missed being and es.
Maurice Tsododo came extremely

close to scoring when he and Cas-
sarino collided in front of the goal ,'
with the Engineer's goalie gaining
possession.

The half closed out with the Feds
shooting and missing two direct
kicks.

The second half was hard-fought
and injury ridden. Doing the seem-
ingly impossible, State hustled and
scrapped even harder than it did in
the first half. The Ped's defense
contained all of RPI’s thrusts as
the game closed out a scoreless tle.

With only 2:07 gone by in the first
overtime period, RPI scored the
first point of the game on a Jeff
Brown head—in off a fast break.
RPl again broke through the Feds
defense to score on Stavros Kur-
lol'l’s boot at 1:50 of the second
ovartime session.

 

The lynrto line

on Sports

by Harold Lynne

Nobody Asked M. 8...: '

APA deserves a lot of credit for its defeat of

Potter Club last week.

The officiating in some of the AMIA football
games last week was horrible.

Tom Robinson’s first place in last Saturday’s
cross-country meet against New Haven was a tre-
mendous accomplishment when one considers that
Tom was unable to practice during the preceding
week due to a virus.

Frosh cross-country stand-out Joe Keating could
develop into one of the finest runners in State history.

Goalie Ron Hamilton has been a pleasant surprise
for the hooters this year; Ron, with no prevtous
college soccer experience, has played well to date.

Ed Wolner is definitely the most improved soccer
player at State. Ed is dribbling better than last year,
his passing is more accurate and his shooting has
become more of a goal threat.

Sophomore Dick Szymanski compiled an extra-
ordinary academic-atheltic record last year. Dick
finished his freshman year with a cumulative aca—
demic average of 3.5. This achievement becomes
even more impressive when one considers that Dick
captained the fresh soccer team, played frosh bas-
ketball and received the Physical Education Depart-
ment's Freshman Athlete of the Year Award.

Senate Hears Plans, for Revisions

ln Form of

Plans for a substantial
change in student govern-
ment were introduced to
Senate as a whole in a
special closed session fol-
lowing the regular meet—
ing last Thursday night.

The plans, still in outline form,
were explained by SA President
Art Johnston. They call for the
abolishment of Senate and the SA
President and Vice President as
such. Government will take the form
of a system of councils which will
encompass all student organiza-
tions.

As Johnston outlined the ideas,
councils would be set up for pro-
gramming, communications, living
areas, academic interest, and re-
ligious interest.

Representatives to these councils
would come from the groups under
the jurisdiction of the councils.
For example, members ofthe Coun-
cil of Communications would come
from the staffs of WSUA, the ASP,
the Carillon, and the other publi-
cations.

MYSKANIA Remains
Two representatives from each
council would serve on the gov-
erniug Central Committee. This

committee may also may include
the members ofMYSKANlA. it would
have final jurisdiction in all areas,
but would grant a good deal of
autonomy to the individual councils.

Although many details remain to
be worked out, Johnston hopes that
the government will be put into op-
eration by February. He commented.
“the time is rigin. We’ve been
working on this for three years.

Condoioni Begins Work

Work first began under the ad-
ministration of SA President Steven
Condoiani. One of his first acts
upon taking office in February, 1962
was to appoint a Government lie—
organization Committee as a staiid-
ing committee of Senate.

The committee worked for two
years, and then in December, 1903,
in a report to Student Personnel
Council, recommended a “total re-
evaluation” of student government.

During Easter vacation last year,
32 students and 15 faculty members
attended a three-day Student Gov-
ernment Conference on campus.

Many Contribute
Since then Johnston has Worked
With a number of different people
in formulating the present plans.
Over the summer he worked with
