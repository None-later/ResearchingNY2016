look at life-to-come at the future home of our insti- r

Sample suites in Van RensselaerVI-iall, to be cc-
cupied later this week by men, were completely fur-

tin boards and stairway carpeting were not entirely
installed, but an overview of the living situation could
easily be gotten from the section which was displayed.

The total impression was certainly a good one,

are combined into what should be a successful ar-

fair sized bedrooms, lounge and bath. Facilities for
study are in abundant evidence, as are such small

boards or tacking notes.

COMMUNICATIONS

 

 

Student Believes Individualism
Needed to Combat Fear

To the Editors:

The letter in October 16 issue of
the ASP signed by "member Albany
Committee for Goldwater" gave me
cause for great consternation.

.The reason that the letter was so
upsetting was that the writer ob-
viously believes that he has been
thinking. The writer has been per-
ceptive enough to see the sad state
of affairs in America today.

He says we are afraid, and we
are afraid. We are afraid of bombs,
and forces beyond our individual
control; we are upset because of
what we interpret as a loss of
morals and concern. We are dis-
turbed because we feel powerless
in the face of complexities.

it is clear that the writer is a
person In fear, but he is also a
symptom of what is wrong with our
society.

Any person who really thinks
about all the problems we face to-
day as a country is bound to see
that the problem is not one of the
society or country alone as a whole
entity. The problem is one of the
people in the society.

For ultimately, the society is
composed of individuals, complex
and intrlducate individuals.

If the body is attacked by diseaaé
it will be cured only when each cell
fights the dread sickness. The road
to health is a long, complicated and
arduous one. There is nothing simple
about it, and the doctor, alone,
doesn't always cure nor understand
it.

Yet the people who support Barry
Goldwater are asking for a simple
cure. They claim we need a man to
lead us out of the abyss of fear.
They’re asking the doctor to cure,
when only the cells can.

Here two things occur to run.
One is the hope so many people
placed in President Kennedy. liven
now, i constantly hear people say,
“I! only he had lived i can’t help
feeling that things would have ini-
proved."

The memorial stamp said, "and
the glow from that lire can truly
light the world." People believed
and trusted in him.

But (here was about John Ken-
nedy an aura of quiet self-confiv
deuce in himself and in his follow
men. lie pcrccivcd the subtletio
and coinplcxi'ies oi individuals a.

by extension of our problems as a
society and as a society in the
world.

He inspired people to master
things as individuals. Phrase upon
phrse comes echoing back from his
presidential years. "ask not what
your country can do for you....”

Here the second thing occurs to
me. This is exactly what the Gold-
water people are asking. Goldwater
is asked to lead us out of fear, but
no one can lead us out of fear be—
cause fear is a personal thing.

As I see it, Goldwater is a man
who fears greatly and men in fear
do not tend to act rationally. Gold-
water cannot “set aside fear;" he
is too afraid. We can only lead
ourselves out of it by our own
convictions.

Granted, we may see by example
a way to convictions and answers,
and this is what President Kennedy
did, but Barry Goldwater does not
do.

The second really disturbingthing
about the ltter was the quote “I dr-
not want a degrading peace." Here
is the height of fear and irrational—
ity. The writer wants our political
system and beliefs to bc supreme.

lie wants peace — peace even at
the prices of war or fast mchs.
Agalii, things are too complex in
the world for fast moves.

Just what practically, the writer
thinks will bringthispeacelsbcyond
me — certainly not Barry Goldwater.
There is not a foreign country In
existence, (excepting Franco’s
Spain), that likes or wants Cold-
water.

i found this summer that the
Japanese people have a terrible
fear of Mr. Goldwater. All those
other students i talked with, that
went abroad reported the same ex-
pression of fear and dislike.

if we were to go in war to con-
quer and spread our ideologies and
superiority (in question to begin
with), just how securc would we be
then. Maybe we would be free of
the bomb-fear, but there Will he
more fears to replace it than can
be imagined. The whole thing is too
absurd to contemplate.

The sad thing is that obviously a
great number of people have not
contemplated or examined or
thought. The author closes unsigned
(from fear?) and says he is willing
in support the strengthofGoidwatcr.

Barry's strength needs support;
his strength is a hollow facade. liut
what we really need is an inner
lliillVl'IIliil strength.

ONE MONTH and two motels late, but we finally made it!

ill. Scores Willi TV

by David Child;

This college Is definitely looking
out for the best interests of its
students. On a Wednesday, I made
a strategic maneuver from Western

Avenue to Washington Avenue
through the Page Hall Alley on my
way to a friendly tavern where I
was to witness the first game of
the World Series.

While sneaking through the doors
1 halted, perked mine ears, and lo
if I did not perceive an announcer
describing the very same game.
Following my senses into a seat

I stared half-believineg at what
looked like the object of my de-
sires. There, in mammoth black,
.and white was the game from Busch
Stadium.

How had this scientific miracle
happened - as an angel meeting me
on my quest of a den of sin and
corruption? The next day, before
the second game, I learned.

T. D. Toleboom Proiocrar
The series was presented by
means of a telebeam projector
through the courtesy of the Tele-
vision Development (T.D.) depart-

ment of the college. lntheir studios
on the second floor of Richardson
Hall, this experimental department
can receive and transmit from any
station In the area.

This phase is but a minor pur-
pose of the group, headed by Mr.
Robert Rowe and assisted by Mr.

James Rice. its mison (I'ctre is
twofold: the teaching of college
students and the observation ofcdu-
cational psychology and methods.

T.D. works from two studios with
accompanying control rooms, andis
able to entertain one hundred-sev—
enty students during each of its four
hours of transmitting.

T. V. for Large Classes

The main studio 15 Room 278
and is called the teaching room.
Messeurs Haber (Business Accoun-
ting), Deule (Math), and Newton
(Remedial Reading) find that they
can instruct larger classes by
means of television with as much
effect as in the conventional class-
room.

From behind a long, narrow table
each “star” Is followed by three
movable cameras which flash their
view onto the three control room
ielevismns. The cameras and di-
recting are all under student guid-
ance.

The second studio is an actual
classroom in Room 270—B. Equipped

with twenty-five desks, two walls of:

green chalk boards, bookcases and
globes for decoration, a rug, and
an air conditioner, this room is seen
by one electronically remote pan and
tilt and two stationary eyes, and
heard by three ears.

Elementary classes are held in the
room each day and education big
brothers can spy on the conduct of
the children and methods of teachers
while being directed by their col-
lege instructors.

Chiol Schooled in Surgery
The equipment, mainly VIdicon,
is maintained by Mr. John Angus,
the technical chief. in his small
office next to Room 270-li there
are several steel cabinets of re-
sci've tubes and n library on Icic-

vlsion surgery. Along with the
ielebeam set is an Ampex video-
tape machine which takes movies
of Important shows produced in the
studios. These are kept in readi-
ness for future consumption.

There are no classes in tele—
vision, regretably, but each student
that is accepted as an employee
(there now being eight) Is instructed
ih techniques of the camera, direc-

ting, and maintenance. Each stu-
dent is also paid a salary but ilie
education received pays far higher
rewards.

For teachers interested in tele-
vision uses for future teaching Dr.
Henderson instructs individually. lie
also explains the operations as part
of lils Audio-Visual course.

New Campus Home

The horizon of television in teach-
ing is wide and deep. Here at
Albany, T.D. will remain through
1966 in an expanded Richardson
home. Classes and observations will
be sent out to the new campus next
year through coaxial cables strung
from telephone poles.

After this gestation period, T.D.
will move Its equipment into facili—
ties in the new, Education Building.
There will be two studios which will
transmit to five classrooms, and by
means of telebeam, will conduct
classes in a large lecture audi-
torium.

The cost of this advanced project
is secret lnii astronomical, yet it
will recoch much more support.
Though we may live to never see-
ing a live professor, millions more
of us will have the opportunity of
studying under T.D.

Dr. Morris Eson called for a
“careful evaluation of various areas
of language arts instruction from
primary reading to college foreign
language instruction" in concluding
the annual Faculty Lecture last
Thursday evening.

Speaking before an overﬂow aud—
ience in Draper 349, he recounted
observations made in his language
research studies with children. He
has conducted studies both with
children in the Bethlehem school
district, and with children in lsrael.

"Nominal Reollsm" Method

In the Israeli siduy, a control
group of children learned English
by the “nominal realism" method.
Thai is, they identified each word
with an object. The experimental
group learned object words throuin
speaking of them in complete sen-

Results showed that the experi-
mental group made exceptionalpro-
grass in their ability to think and
express themselves In thelanguage.
in contrast, the control group had
difficulty in using the new words.

Teach In Sentences

Dr. Eson remarked that language
instruction should take into con-
sideration the importance of teach-
Ing in expressive, meaningful sen-
tences.

The “one word-one object" ap-
proach is a major failing oftlie Dick
and Jane reader series, he pointed
out.

He felt that a re-evaluation was
necessary “so that the development
of ilie elementary cognitive functions
can be integrated fully into the con—
text of symbol use, and so that
language plays a more significant
role In eniiancing the quality and
effectiveness of thinking."

ican Association of University Pi‘o-
