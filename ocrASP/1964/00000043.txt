period outplaying their opponents

two of them barely missed pene-

Defense Excels

in the second period the accent
was on defense and as a result play
was concentrated in the center of
the field. Midway through the sec-

away from the pack on a fast break.
During the ensuing lamp up that fol-

llr. Andrews Starts
truss-country Race

When Albany State's undefeated
cross-country team lined up against
Montclair State Saturday afternoon
in Washington Park, the man who
fired the gun to start the race had
many memories of other cross-
country teams at State.

Dr. Luther Andrews, a consultant
for General Electric Company, and
head of the Physics Department at
State. fired the gun sendingthe teams
over the grueling 4.55-mile course.
Dr. Andrews coached the first har—
rier team at State in 1934. its was,
at the limo, ayouhgphysicsinstruc-
tor.

'. Andrews recalls how he used
to rim with his team at ilu.m., which
was their otily frectime. ’i‘hccoursc
started in Washington Park, nndox-
tended to Lincoln Park and buck.
Dr. Andrew; coached the sport only
for its first season; after four years
the sport was dropped. it was rc-‘-
organized ihreo years ago, under
the present conch, Keith Munsey.

An avid fan of the current cross-
couhtry team, Dr. Andrews ishoppy
over the team's fine showing over
the past throo yours.

Montclairs Ralph Vernacchia for fifth place in the Meet.

The meet was witnessed
by a large and enthusiastic
crowd, lncludingmany par-
ents of participating run-
ners as a result of Par-
ents’ Day at Albany State.

Coach Munsey singled out Clark
as having run “a good race." He
also praised Darmer who “continues
to have knee trouble but just won’t
quit."

Paul Russo New Runner .

A new face in the Perl ranks is
Paul Russo, from Amsterdam. Paul
has the potential to be a good run-
ner according to Coach Munsey who
said, "I’m glad he is out but sorry
he was not able to come out sooner."

Next Saturday the cross-country
team travels to Plattsburgh where
Coach Munsey anticipates a tough
battle with the Cardinals. He said,
l‘Even though they lost to us last
year (25—31), I understand they have
last no one and have added a couple
of new men. Also. they will be rgn-
iting over their own course, aii
added advantage."

The win over Montclair boosted
the Ped’s mark to 6-0, their thir-
teen straight over the past two
seasons.

Keatlng Wins, Fresh Lose

Depth problems continued t6
plague the Fed freshman squad as
they lost to a good Montclair team.
Joe Keating turned in a terrific
performance for the team as he
eclipsed the course record hynear-
iy a minute. lie Won the 3.2 mile
event in 17:35.7.

Keating was followed closely by
three Montclair runners who were

the long Madison Avenue stretch and
held it to the finish line.
