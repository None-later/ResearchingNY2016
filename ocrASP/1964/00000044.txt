' P sident Arthur Johnston

announced the closingout of i

the budget of “The Torch.”
the student yearbook, at
Wednesday’s Senate meet-
ing.

Johnston said he had taken this
executive action in response to the
changing of the yearbook's name
to "The Carillon,” by William Col-
gan, editor of the yearbook.

The yearbook has never had a
constitution and presently exists
as a de facto organization. The
only official record of its existence
is the yearly budget passed by

will be the Carillon Bell.Tower
in the center of the academic com- '
Carillon is a unique and dis-
tinctive title; many high schools,
on the other hand, use the name
Torch for their yearbooks.”

in a .related action a bill in- ‘
troduced by Senator Al Bader was
passed which provides that no Stu-
dent Association supported publica-
tion can change its name without
the approval of Senate.

The rest of the Senate meeting
was occupied mainly with reports
by committees, announcements of
future committee meetings, and the

its debut last week. Robert Bell,
Manager of the State University
Bookstore, had advertised in Coun-
terpoint despite its lack of official
recognition.

Johnston said that the ad had been
run with the understanding that the
editors of Counterpoint would pre-
sent a constitution within a few
weeks.

in other action, Senate approved
the appoint of James Economides,
a freshmen, as Parliamentarian by
a vote of 33-0-1. The resignations
of Robert Clark and Charles Moden
from Senate were also accepted.

take place within the next few days.
