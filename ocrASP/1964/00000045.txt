,_ ‘eWspapers’for Senator Kenneth B. Keating is.
we feel, a true cammendation for an able legislator.

.Even the daring young man from Massachusetts (and

irglnia) has refrained from making any major attacks

, ' political record‘that is hard to equal. ' For ex-
 .famplet' . f
‘ .In 1957, 1960 and 1964 Senator Keatingwas an active
Campaigner in the fight to pass the Civil Rights Bills.

His amendments to the Foreign Aid Bill drastically
reduced the assistance dictators and other tyrants
could reap, from it.

,, His, amendments to the Export Control Act squeezed
off more illegal exports of strategic materials to
the Soviet Bloc.

He supported the first Housing Act that provided

. low-cost housing for veterans. .

; Just one more thing: Itwas Senator Keating'who in—
formed the American public that Communist missile
bases were being erected in Cuba while the adminis-
tration denied their existence.

This is a man who has spent 18 years in Washington
helping his home state. Because he is a member of a
minority party in Congress, this has not been an easy
matter.

Despite his record, his abilities and his knowledge
of his state, Senator Keating will be fighting this year
to save his political career from the onslaught of an
ambitious young man who served exactly 3 years and
8 months as Attorney General of the United States, a
time fraught with civil strife and controversy. He
was rejected by the Democratic presidential candi-

‘ date as a running mate after years of personal con-
“flict with him and the question of how well these
_two political rivals can worktogether is a pressing
consideration.

In short, there is no real doubt as to which is the
better qualified for the office of Senator from New
York.

E
Tlrlh'tm'l'ed t‘drial entitled "Mis-

sion Accomplished?" in your Sep-
tember 25th issue you raise aques-
tion which deserves very serious
consideration: Granting the right-
ness of the civil rights cause, was.
it rational or moral to send inex-
perienced and unprotected youths in—
to such anextremelydangerous situ-
ation, when the violence and death
which actually occurred could have
been reckoned beforehand as a very
real possibility?

I confess I am not completely
certain it was, but I have some
reasons for thinking it was, which
I would like to try to indicate.
However, I want to~emphasize that
I think an easy-to-give answer one
way or the other is probably a
shallow answer; I can respect the
integrity of an opposite conclusion,
for l have felt its pull within my-
self. -

The question, as Dr. Birr and
Miss Metz have both pointed out
in their letters responding to your
editorial, is one that can only be
answered by considerng (1) what
the situation was, (2) what else
might have been done, and (a) what.
they did.

The situation was (as it still is)
that a moral revolution must come
to the South very, very soon or the
violence and bloodshed and other
human destruction that have al-
ready occurred may be but the be-
ginning.

The situation is that until amoral
revolution does come to the South
the struggle for human rights there
cannot be won. The situation is
that every delay in bringing it about
multiplies the human destouction.

No amount oi legislation and meet-
ing force with force are, by them-
selves, golng to bring it about; in
fact there comes a point - which

Student Association Illegal

The reasoning used by Senate in freezing the Year—
book’s budget because it changed its name is utterly
ridiculous. However, for the moment we will grant
Senate’s premise: an organization which changes its
name ceases to exist until is receives official recog-
nition from Senate.

Now we look at the Student Association Constitution

‘as printed in the 1964 edition ofCampus Viewpoint, the
official handbook of the State University of New York
at Albany. Since the Constitution contains amendments
passed as late as 1963, we can assume that the Con-
stitution is correct and up~to-date.

in looking at Article I, we read that “The Name oi
this organization shall be the Student Association of New
York Stole College for Teachers at Albany."

, \Vc remind Senate that for the past few years we
have been attending the State University of New York
at Albany.

Granted, the Student Association of New York State
College for Teachers at Albany still exists, since it
hasn’t changed Its name. But what Is the Student
Association of New York State College for Teachers
at Albany doing governing the students of the State
University of New York at Albany?

Perhaps we should freeze the funds of the entire
Student Association until we got the matterstraighten-

ed out.

Who ever killed Rivalry? It did 0 lot for us. Maybe
it took a little time but it was worth it.

sthreatens that
which their use to date has helped
to achieve. _ '

liuman rights for the Negro can-
not become significant'realities in
a South that remains an armed camp
seething'with hatred.

What can be done to break down
racial hatreds and cause to exist
in their place genuine moral aware-
ness of one human being of another?
I cannot think of any really effec-
tive way other than by individuals
exemplifying the attitudes they are
seeking to bring into_being; the only
finally effective toxin against racial
discrimination is moral awareness,
and the only practically effective
means of social action to spread
this innoculator is by the contagion
of example.

This basically, as lunderstand
it, is what the Mississippi Project
was all about. A variety of speci-
fic projects were undertaken, of
course, such as voter registration,
each with a value in itself, but
these were but the means of giving
embodiment to the underlying pur—
pose: the moral mission.

If anything does, it is this which
fundamentally justified puttingthose
specific individuals, with the speci-
fic kind of training they were given,
in Mississippi in the summer of
1964. All the evidence I have seen
indicates that they were well chosen
and given reasonably adequate trainv
ing to get done what they were sent
there to do.

I cannot think of apractical alter-
native or more realistic way of
seeking to meet the basic crisis
faced in the struggle for human
rights for the Negro in the South
this past summer.

I know that such talk can sound
hopelessly unconvincing to someone
who has felt deeply such a tragedy
as the deaths of the three young
civil rights workers and is bur-
dened with the question of whether
the whole scheme wasn’t the off-
spring of too much fine talk with-
out enough honest facing of what
the consequences could be for those
who got involved — whether the good
that could be achieved could pos-
sibly Justify the dreadful human cost
that might have to be paid for it.

i feel the need to make clearer
and more poignant why I have given
the kind of answer I have. [think
I can do this with an analogy.

But I must begin by indicating
-more specifically what I mean by
moral awareness, what lunderstand
to be its human significance, and
what I take to be the specific con-
sequences of its being manifested
by the civil rights workers in Mis-
sissippi this past summer.

One becomes a moral beingwhen,
or to the extent, he achieves the
capability of experiencing a human-
itarian concern — a sense ofrespect
for the worth of human per'sonality,
which, if it is genuine, necessarily
issues in a willingness to make
personal sacrifices that obstacles
to the spiritual development of fel-
low beings may be removed or
lessened.

a sense of dignity and integrity and v

humanitarian concern as a part of
a rich variety of ways the individual
has come to be able toexpress him-

ﬁel’l‘rlle more profound religious acts
are spiritual in this sense, though not
all spiritual acts are expressions of
a religious outlook. Of course, at
any time there are more persons
who act morally than there are
those have achieved genuine moral
being; one may act morally out of
a narrow self interest or simply
“right” habit. '

It is a mark of a genuine moral
commitment that it issues in a firm
adherence to an ideal of personal
integrity, Which influences the nature
and the spirit of all ofone’s actions.

There are justifiable bases of
judging people superior and inferi~
or, and none more significant than
a classification in terms of depth
of moral feeling and commitment.

Many of us see the civil rights
workers who risked their lives in
Mississippi this past summer seek-
ing to help the Southern Negro gain
a greater measure of freedom and
opportunity to live with dignity and
increase his capabilities for self-
fulfillmcnt, as among the moral
aristocrats of our age.

Even if their efforts to change
attitudes and laws had totally failed,
their actions would be something
we, as well as they, could look to
with pride and respect as marvelous
manifestations of that kind of hu-
manity, which gives a dimension of
nobility to human life.

But they did not fail. On October
6, the “Knickerbocker News” car-
ried a “New York Times” factual
report on changes already noticeable
since the summer’s activities,
changes for which the presence and
activities of the civil rights workers
are recognized as influential fac-
tors. These, state tlle article, are
some of the changes:

“The White Citizens Councils,
which at one time represented ef-
fective, almost total opposition to
compliance with federal integra-
tion decrees and policies, have lost
most of their influence.

“Moderates have begun to or-
ganize and as a result there has
been a lessening of demogoguery
on the race issue in some seas.

“As a result of work by the FBI,
the state has begun to purge mem-
bers of the Ku Klux Klan from the
State Highway Patrol.

“A number ofpublic officialshave
begun to speak out against violence.

“The states' investigative and
police forces have been brought Into
play against bands of terrorists who
have burned and bombed churches,
homes, and civil rights buildings."

Of course the activities of the
civil rights workers were not the
only forces working towards these
results,

There is the very tangible evi-
dence that sizable numbers of No-
groes were given the encouragement
they needed to register and to ac-
tively affiliate with groups working

Eighth Anniversary of Hungarian

Freedom Revolt Evohes

by George Nagy

Editor's Note:

Mr. Nagy Is a native oi Hungary
who has recently come to stay
permanently in the United States.

He was a member of the Hungar-
ian weight-lllting team at the
Weight Lifting Championships in
Sweden. He managed to leave the
team and went to West Germany,
lwhere he obtained political as-
um.

After receiving the necessary
papers he EnterEd the United
States three months ago. At the
present time he Is a member at
the class of I968.

The following article is written
from the personal experiences of

Mr. Nagy.

The outbreak of the Hungarian
Freedom Revolt lies eight years
back today and probably many of
us have only little idea of what
happened at that time in that tiny
Middle-European country. On this
anniversary we should not only re-
member. Let us try to look quite
deeply into a people’s aims, emo-
tions, and fate.

The savage Rakosi regime which
had been in power in Hungary Since
the end of the second World War
committed innumerable political,
ideological and economic failures.

The whole military and citizen

demonstrators, and after about one
week of hard figllting,afree govern-
ment came into existence.

TraitorstHung in Trees

Commuulsls’ bodies hung on the
autumn—trees of Stalin Street and
beside the bodies you could see
their party-book or the remarks
of the indignant revolutionists:
“Dirty Red", "communist dog" or
simply‘ “traitor”.

Notluug was more horrifying in
these days than taking a walk across
bloodndrenched Budapest.

Seeing the unstoppable successes
of the freedom-fighters. the Rus-
sian troops moved out of the city
and began to negotiate about their
complete withdrawal with the head
of the revolutionary government,
Imre Nagy.

In fact, they prepared for a counter
attack in the meantime,addiugahout
100,000 more men and modern mili-
tary equipment to their forces in
Hungary.

The real blood-shed began on'
the 4th of November 1956, when‘
wild Mongolian soldiers and rough,
uneducated Russian youngsters be-
gan to butcher the Hungarian people.

City Shelled by Cannon

They attacked the capital city
from all directions with more than
5,000 armed vehicles at 3 o’clock
in the morning. The land shook
under us, strong detonations broke
our windows, and the night turned
into daylight from the endless fire
of the Reds‘ cannons.

One of the smallest lands of
Europe fouqu its life-and-death
struggle against the second great-
est power of the world.

I don’t know how many times
the Budapest radio repeated the
Hungarian people's call for help
to the western allies in English
German and French, but I know that
none of these countries showed the
slightest willingness to give ef-
fective military support against the
Russian neo-colonlallsts.

How often did we look up to the
skies, waning for the American
paratroopers to arrive. and how
embittered we were to learn tilal
the Russian jet-fighter planes ap-
peared Instead!

You could read from the eyes
of every hungry, nnserably-drcssed
exhausted rovolutionist that he
blamed the West for turning its
back upon Hungary.
