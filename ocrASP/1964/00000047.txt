Wolner Scores Three

Wolner broke into the scoring
column for the first time this sea-
son, scoringat 2:50 and 21:41 ofthe
first quarter, and at 14:00 of the
second period.

The remaining Ped scores were
tallied by Udo Guddat at 14:40 of
the first quarter, Fred Rawe at
19:15 of the second quarter, Joe

Procoplo at 9:40 of the final period, ,

and Bill Haas at 14:55 of the last
quarter.

Isaac Baum accounted for Utica's
lone goal when he broke throuin
the Fed defenses for a score in the
second period. The goal came at
11:03 of the quarter.

The half-time score showed State
leading Utica by an eight to one
margin. The referees decided to
curtail the playing time of the third
and fourth quarters, cutting them
from twenty-two minutes to fifteen
minutes.

State's defense was simply fantas-
tic. Due to the overall offensive
strength of the Feds, coach Garcia
was able to go with a five man de-
fense instead of the usual six. Marty
Fallon, Nick Morris, Marty Miller,
Dick Syzmanski, and Len Bergen
formed an impenetrable defense that
allowed only four shots to be taken
at the goal.

Albany’s goalies, Ron Hamilton,
and Anton Salecker,alternated play-
ing tile position during the game.

State‘s offense was overpowering
as the Feds got offtllirty-three shots
at Utica's goal.

Albany's recordisnow 2-3-1. The
Feds travel to Plattsburgh tomor-
row. Last year the Cardinals beat
State 2—0 on Homecoming Weekend.
Coach Garcia anticipates a tough
battle with Plattsburgh, but hopes his
team’s new found confidence will
lead to a victory.

The lynse line on Sports

by Harold Lynne

Tomorrow the cross-country travels to Plattsburgh
in quest of its eighth straight dual meet victory this
year and its fourteenth straight over a two-yearperiod.
Regardless of what the team does in its last three
meets, we feel that it has already earned a trip to the
NCAA College Division Championships at Wheaten,

Illinois next month.

Last year the Athletic Department decided to send
the barriers to Wheaton: it was, to our knowledge, the
first time that an Albany State team had competed in
an NCAA championship. Runningngninsttwenty—scven
of the best college teams in the country, the cross~
country team finished fourteenth. Tom Robinson was
the first Pcd to come across the finishllnc: he finished

twenty-eighth.

This your the team is much improved. Obviously,
the barriers cannot better last year’s perfect record,
but, man for man, the runners are better than last

year.

The nucleus of last year’s squad. Robinson,

Dennis ’i‘uttlc. John Clark, and Ken Klrik, has re-

turned.

Also, the addition of transfer Bob Flick and

last year's freshman star Ken Dormer has strength-

cncd the barriers.

if the Athletic Department votes to allow the team
to go to Wheaten again. we are sure that the harriers
would turn in a much more impressive performance

than last year.

Robinson would have an excellent

chance to finish in the top fifteen, which would qualify
him for the University Division Championships held

into in November.

Tops Brutes 7-0

SLS maintained its undefeated
record this week by blanking Water-
bury 13-0, lastTuesday. Intheother
Ins-pound league game, this week
APA and KB played to an 0-0 tie
on Wednesday.

SLS was led by the quarterbacklng
of Charlie Hickey and the alert
pass defense of Glen Firestone and
Sandy Barman. In tile first half
Firestone intercepted a misguided
toss by Waterbury's quarterback
Keil Walker and ran it back deep
into Waterbury territory. Then
Hickey threw to Bob Ryan for a
touchdown.

The extra point came via a boot-
leg play by Hickey. Led by fierce
offensive blocking, lllckey swept
around left end for SLS’ seventh
point.

Another timely interception, this
one by Berman, set up a scoring
play ill the second half. Herman
also fail his interception back deep
into the Waterbury secondary.

Now is ills third year of varsity
cross-country, Dennis Tuttle has
known the frustration of being the
number two Ped barrier for each
of those years. He has had the mis-
fortune of running behind the Fed's
best cross-country runner of all
time, Tom Robinson.

Tuttle has only run cross-country

since his sophomore year at State,
as in high school he played soccer

in AMIA Play

Three plays later Hickey went over
for the touchdown.

Waterbury mountedastrongscor-
ing threat late iii the fourth quarter
when Walker threw four straight
completed passes.

In "pygmy" league action last
Tuesday, APA defeated Waterbury
Brutes ’7-0. The APA score came
on a (55-yard touchdown march which
was highlighted by strong offensive
blocking by the APA line. Water-
bury’s pass defense was rigid;
therefore APA had to take to the
ground. Quarterback Doug Morgan
scored the touchdown on a bootleg
play from three yards out.

instead. He also ran track in high
school and holds the school record
for the mile, 4:32. Dennis lettered
in track twice and soccer once.

Tuttle hails from Homer, New
York, and is majoring in History
here at Albany.

Last year Dennis broke two of
Robinson’s course records, at One-
onta and Siena, only to learn when
he crossed the finish linethat Robin-
son llad already set a new record
if] winning the race.

’l‘uttle’s biggest thrill in running
cross-country calne last year when
he placed fifty-fifth out of over
three—hundred barriers at the Na-
tional Meet for small universities
and colleges at Wheaton College in
Chicago.

Besides studying and running,
Dennis ilas found time to work in
the school library and serve as
the staff head of costumes for the
drama department. He also be-
longs to the Di-ainntlcs and Arts
Council.

It’s no easy lent to be the number
two man for three years oilacross-
country team such as ours. Dennis
Tuttle is no second rate runner,
bllt rather like Lou Gehrig was
behind Babe Ruthntrulyl‘iiie athlete.

of thought in the

He stressed the individualism found in the
quest for men’s identity.

Boas Compares Aspects
 Italian Renaissance

Using the premise that
“no matter how different
things are, they can be
shown to interrelate if only
by their differences,” Dr.
George Boas opened the
first session ofthe Renais-
sance Symposium Monday
night at Page Hall.

His speech was entitled, “Cross
Currents of the Italian Renais-
sance."

The only single trait, pointed out
Boas, which can unite the several
different aspects of the ltallan Ren-
Jssance, such as art, music, litera-
ture and politics, is that these as-
pects occurred in the salnc chrono-
logical period — from 1450-1550.

Renaissance Not Unique

Although many spectacularevents
took place between these dates, the
Renaissance is ilot so singular as
we llelll'VC, said Boas. Today, just
as illeil, progress is being made in
illl fields of thought. iiowever,
nothing on such a large scale and
happening within such a relatively
short time has been found since the
Reilaisszulcc.

As do many authorities, lions ob—
jected lo the name Renaissance as
inappropriate for the period, “Tile
age is ilol a rebirthofiulylbiilg,“but
an expansion and progression of
)lder idens and arts, he argued.

This span of yours was labeled
by lions as "ii century of strife.”
The struggle for authority between
the l’upacy and secular powers, the
antagonism of many ltalinn States,
the national huti'ed between France
and England, the religious contro-
versy of the Catholic and Protestant
Churches, and strife within the Cath-
olic Church between the Franciscan
and Dominican orders are major
examples of this strife.

Age of Individualism
Within the five ltullnn States were
many struggling actions, it situation
which resulted in disunliy and crea-
tive power. “Disunity”, continued

, was, "is more revealing of an age.
h

an unity because disunliy provides
for the freedom of thought and in-

f divtduality,“

"The Age of Individualism" was

 suggested by Boas as a name for
,3

this period. More great personali-
ties have come from this age than
from any other. DaVinci was such
21 individual personality. Through
the rejection of authority, DaVinci
was led to a new source of truth —
himself.

The overwhelming concept of
truth during this period as stated
by Boas, is that each man is his
own judge.

The Empirical method which had
been established under Aristotle’s
method of appealing to nature, was
enriched by thinkers of the Renais-
sance. Aristotle’s method failed
to answer one question, 1‘what should
we look for?”

The three steps of "Galileo" best
illustrated the improvement of the
empii'lcle method. ills steps are
to analyze the problem, see the
question, and then image real situ-
ations, which would illustrate the
problem.

In conclusion, Dr. Boas said that
the “ltaliail Renaissance lstlle most
striking example of diversified and
adventurous cultural progress."
