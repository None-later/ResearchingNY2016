I'elrllrst'loss Editor's Attend
Press («reference is Chicago

Editors of the Albany ' Student
Press and the Carillon traveled
to Chicago last weekend to attend
the fortieth annual conference of
the Associated Collegiate Press.

Held in the Conrad Hilton Hotel,
the conference brought together over
1100 student journalists from 324
colleges across the country. They
represented 516 newspapers, year-
books, and magazines.

Attending from Albany were Karen
Keefer, Edith Hardy and Judith Con-
ger of the Albany Student Press, and
William Colgan, Steven Curti, and
Eileen Manning from the Carillon.

Conference sessions covered ev-
ery aspect of college journalism
from the writing itself to photog-
raphy, layout, and typography. Also
included were sessions on business
and advertising, and on the philoso-
phy behind the student press.

Experienced Journalists Teach

Delegates had the chance to hear
sessions conducted by such experi-
enced Journalists as Professor Ed-
mund Arnold ofSyracuse University,
author of several books on typog-
raphy, Professor Melvin Mencher

of' the Columbia Graduate School of
Journalism, John A. McWethy,man-
aging editor for the mldwest edition
of the Wall Street Journal, and Casey
Banas of the Chicago Tribune.

Perhaps even more helpful than
the sessions themselves were the
chances to meet students from other
schools and to exchange ideas and
solutions «to mutual problems. In
addition the ACP provided displays
of award-winning newspapers and
yearbooks, which could béexamined
at leisure.

Shulmon Addresses Delegates

A highlight of the conference was
the address by Max Shulman, creator
of Dobie 611115, at the ACP Awards
Luncheon on Saturday. Speaking on
“How to be a Writer, or Oblivion
Made Simple," be displayed all the
humor that made his column for
Marlboro cigarettes a favorite with
college students for ten years.

Although Shulman’s column was
discontinued when- cigarette adver-
tisements were taken out of college
papers, Shulman: announced that he
will return in January with a new
sponsor.

BRAVE NEW WORLD REVISITED

for the New Campus Dwellers.

is a popular reading selection

Noise, Dust, Inconvenience
Prevail on New Campus

"it’s the only place in the world
where you can wake up to the sweet
sound of a GM cement truck letting
its air brakes off."

The remark by Gerry Terdiman,
one of the first 200 men on the new
campus, sums up the not unexpec-
ted student reaction to life and
study in the midst of the building
of a University.

Steam hammers, air compres—
.sors, bull dozers, dump trucks, and
hand saws outnumber the students
at the present time, encouraging
early risers and making study im-
possible during the day.

Moved Saturday

The 200 men, who had spent the
first six weeks of the semester
in the more remote if more quiet
'quarters of the Governor's and
Country Squire motels, moved into
the still incomplete Van Rensselaer
and Rywick dormitories last Satur-
day.

With construction being rushed
to completion onthe remaining three
units and center tower of the first
dormitory complex, noise, incon-
venience, and dust make life diffi—
cult on the new campus.

Ii study conditions areimpossible
during the day, they are excellent
at night. The system of individual
study rooms, and the isolation of

the students, combine toprovide ex-°
cellent conditions.

The dormitories are still several
weeks away from completion. Car-
peting, wall sockets, lounge furni-
ture, the recreation and laundry
rooms, still have to be added.

Sound Difficulties

Acoustics within the individual
suites is the main student com-
plaint. Any noise, such as the
shutting of a door, echoes and re-
echoes throughout the rooms. With—
out carpeting on the floors, as had
originally been planned, the problem
is aggrevated.

One student remarked, “Stone
(referring to the University archi-
tect, Edward Durell Stone) might bet)
a great artist,buthe’saiousy scien-

.tlst when it comes to understanding

sound . ’ ’

One aspect of the new dormi-
tories that has proved popular, how-
ever, is the presence of private
telephones in each of the suites.
Students are allowed to make an un-
limited number of free calls on these
phones.

The only drawback to the system
is a handful] of students who have
delighted in mat mg “crank” calls
to their dormitory males during all
hours of the night.

Ed. Note: The following article a -
cured in the "Greenville Dal
ellector," Greenville, N.C.
faculty member brought it to our
attention as an Interesting com-
ment on a much-discussed issue.

by Frank Adams

Since hearing a few weeks ago
a brief symposium on immorality
on college campuses we have been
speculating on this fascinating topic.
After all, we’ve worked on cam-
uses for most of the last thirty
years.)

Since the topic is a complex one,
we haven’t come' to any conclusions
about which we feel confident.

We have, though, settled on twoin-
troductory premises. One is that
what is usually thought of when im-
morality on the campus is men-
tioned, the relationship between
male and female students,..has ab-
solutely no relevance whatever to
the topic.

(If courting customs interest you,
studies. indicate that such intimacy
as does prevail in colleges is less
than that among people of the same
age who don’t go to college.)

I g _ Morality  'Mcot
’Relatively High Social Standards

The other premise we have ar-
rived at is that, since institutions of
higher learning are by their very na-
ture actuated by an extremely high
idealism, moral standards on cam-
pus are considerably higher than
those in the surrounding society.

Hence a consideration of campus
morality, to be comprehensible to
the outsider, would probabl y require
a good bit of explanation of what
campus moral standards are.

Plagiarism, for example, is the
basis for a good portion of the en-
tertainment world’s product. (Tele-
vision comedians even boast oftheir
plagiarism.) Yet on the campus,
plagiarism is probably the most im-
moral act which astudentor scholar
can commit.

For another example, starting
with a conclusion and then finding
facts to support it or twisting facts
to seem to support it, a description
of virtually all advertising, is inthe
academic world flatly immoral.

Or, for a third example, politics
is a matter of relentlessly hammer-
ing away on one side of a question.
For a teacher in a classroom know;
lngiy to slight any side of aquestion
is. again, totally immoral.

That there is immoralin on col-
lege campuses we do not deny. But
the hard truth is that the outsider is
unlikely to know what is and that his
attempts to deal with what he thinks
of as immorality in colleges are
likely to be ihemselvcs, by campus
definition, immoral.
