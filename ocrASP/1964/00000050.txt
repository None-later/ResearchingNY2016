United States _,’prosperity.
W. not everyone is quite so sure,

,. ‘ains that prosperitywill
' Early in July Johnson hadalready
inStructed hiscabinet to talk "pros-
parity, people and peace" during the
computed. He was quoted as saying:
“When'the people know how good
things are and are going to be,
they’ll stop worrying about who is
going to move‘ next door.”

1‘. Whatever Johnson’s motives for
discussing prosperity, it’ll be dif-
ficult for Goldwater to challenge
it'. However, as is characteristic
.of the man from Arizona, he's
going to try. '

Goldwater on Prosperity

The Senator first agrees with
Johnson’s plan to reduce taxes and
eliminate government waste. This
is about as close as he can get to '
an attack. He does imply that the
government is not protecting the
value of the dollar, however, and
calls for a reduction of "not less
than $5 billion in the present level
of government spending."

Failing here, Goldwater then
moves on to the Poverty campaign
of the Johnson administration. The
Republican platform pledges support
of “practical federal-state-local
programs which will effectiver
treat the needs of the poor, while
resisting . . . federal handouts...”

Aid to Education

Johnson has come out, albeit ob-
liquely, for Federal aid programsto
secondary and elementary schools.
Goldwater, on the other hand, feels
shch aid “unnecessary and unwise"
and advocates that any aid be avail-
able to all schools,public,parochiai
or private.

The Republican platform further
pledges support of school prayers
providing that they are “not pre-

Whom

pared or prescribed by the state
. . . and . . . participation is not
coerced.” , ,

Skipping from the schoolhouse
to the corn-fields, both Republican
and Democratic platforms advocate
the same basic programs. Both'
suggest parity payments to keep
farm prices stable.

Both parties support community
or farm-owned cooperatives. The
Democrats would continue the food
stamp program and other surplus
food‘ programs while the Republi-
cans would support“peyment in kind
out of government-owned sur-
pluses.”

The Campaign

Let no one underestimate the im-.
portance of big-money in thiselec-r
tion campaign. One of the behind-
the-scenes issues will be what eco-
nomic group will assume control.
Last July, the Republican conven-
tton was abattle between the Eastern
money-men led by Rockefeller and

Goldwater.

The campaign now is just as hot
in the business luncheon crowd asit
is in the open-square rally crowds.

‘ Both Johnson and Goldwater have
eagerly courted the bankers and fi-
nanciers so necessary to a President
and candidate. ,

Goldwater’s defeat in ’64 would
probably mean a victory of the
Rockefeller element of the party
backed by the Wall Street investors
that Phyllis Schlafly unkindly calls
the "kingmakers."

It would definitely mean a change
in the Republican Party power struc-
ture.

The Answers

In four days, the country will
know its President for the next
four years. Whoever is elected,
the changes will not be radical.
There will probably be the Bobby
Baker, Billy Sol Estes cases; there
will probably be more disputes with
the USSR; there will be more Viet-
nams.

Whoever is elected will still have
to govern the people of the United
States with their hopes, fears and
faith.

Humor Gives Refuge
Iii‘2llll 'Pioneers’

Student reaction to the inconveni-
ences presented by life and study on
the new campus have run the gamut
from stoicism, to understanding, to
self-directed humor, to cynicism.

Some of the 200 “pioneers” have
taken refuge in scholarly persuits.
Aldous Huxley's “Brave New
World,” revisited, in particular,
seems to be popular.

Others have retreated to_ more
humorous refuges.

A sign, complete with nebish,
dominates one room with the ad-
monition, “Don't pity us, we’re
not as sad as we look.”

One student contented himself with
remarking, "Today they drew in the

lines on the tennis courts; it’s a
pity we ran out of toilet paper."

Issue Transcend: Class Boundaries

by J. Roger Lee

Next Tuesday, some of us will go
to the polls and vote for either
Lyndon Johnson or Barry Goldwater.
There are many ways to look on un'
election. The marxists and their
kind see candidates as representa-
tives of class interests.

This writer thinks, however, that
there are issues that transcend
class lines or any other kind ofline.

PRESIDENT

on all men. Operatingonthisprein-
tse, it seems clear that it is in the
interest of all men to cast their
ballot for Barry Goldwater.

All responsible men today see man
as a goal-pursuing creature. It is
generally conceded that man should
act to attain his values. Even those
who see society as prior to the in-
dividual concede that if a society is
to overcome its problems, themem-
bers of a society have to act toward
that end.

Freedom Necessary

Yet what not all people admit
to is the truth that for man to act
toward his gents, it is necessary
for him to be free.

Freedom is a necessary condition
for human action - for human life.
All men need freedom. All men
should choose freedom and it is be-
cnuse of this that all men should
vote for Senator Goldwater next
Tuesday.

This nuttoii was the first state in
the history of man to be founded
on the premise that man should be
free. It is the nature ofourgovorn-
merit to safeguard our freedoms.
Of all today's politicians Senator
Goldwater is the most consistent
defender of this concept of govern-
mont.

freedom in the world today, The
first is internal. It is the attempt
to subvert our government — to re-
define its nature in illlbernl terms.
There are those who ask us to give
up our freedoms in return for so-
curity.

There are those who tell us to
give up our rights to our property
in return for welfare doles to meet
our needs.

Senator Goldwater is opposed to
this concept of govorniiieiit us a
“beneficient” and nil-ruling big
brother. Senator Goldwater is for
the concept of government as apro-
tcctur of our freedoms. All men who
are interested in securing their
freedoms should vote for Senator
Goldwater.

Victory

The second threat to our freedom
comes from abroad — from the world
communist movement. it we are to
remain a free people, the comm unist
iiiciinco must be halted.

We have tried to reason with ilio
Communists, biil thlshns repeatedly
lend to failure. We tried at Yultn,
and Potsdam, at Geneva undiiii'egu-
inr diplomatic i'ulntioiis.

The only llllloh' thnt communist
expansion has been checked have
icon the times that we stood firmly
against thorn. It is Senator Cold-
water who fiivors firm actions
against the communists.

it is PresidoutJohnsrni who favors
the diScreditod policy of "come let
us reason together" and who says,
“We will meet the Russians half-
way, and even further than halfway
if that is necessary."

All voters who urelnterestod
in freedom should vote for a win-
ning foreign policy - the Goldwater
policy. .

Barry Goldwater does not offer
money or pull to those who vote
for him. lie only offers freedom.
All men should accept freedom and
vote for Barry Goldwater.

7’77 OF THE WEEK

Who will be elected Miss Cninpus Chest?

 

 

' by Paul Jensen

A review of Herzog in "Co'unter-
point" mentioned the old conflict
between the quality of a “work of
art,” and its popular acceptance.

The essence of the problem is
that if a work has undoubted artis-
tic merit, and also appears on best-
seller lists, something is wrong.
It is inconsistent that a truly crea-
tive work can also have mass ap-

al.

This theory is, of course,debata-
blew It may be that the .general
public has achieved the insight
needed to appreciate the complexi-
ties of such a work.

'It may also be that another as-
pect — the plot, a concern with sex,
and so forth — appeals to the reader
on a purely superficial level.

Also, as the critic remarked,
the work may have been l'sold" to
the public as a “great” book, asthe
book that will be talked about, asthe
book that everyone should at‘ least
be familiar with.’

In other words, the book and
author have achieved the state of
being “in” - a state which appeals
to those in the know, to those who
would like to be in the know, and
even to the general public.

Far from limited to the field of
books, this phenomenon is common
to all creative efforts, not the least
of which is the area of Film.

General critical opinion on pic-
tures, directors, even styles of
filming tends to fluctuate‘a great
deal. What is critically acceptable
one month may be entirely out of
favor the next.

Participation in this game ofkeep-
ing up with the reputationsis almost
universal. As soon as a general
trend is spotted, it becomes prac-
tically irreversible - until an op-
posite trend starts some time later.

This is an extremely unfortunate
situation, for very often the selec-
tion of who is in and who is out has
nothing 'to do with the quality of
their work.

About six years ago, when Ingmar
Bergman won an Academy Award
for “The Virgin Spring”, his stock
was really stratospheric. The in-
evitable result was the gradual set—
ting in of a negative critical opinion.

Superficial Comment

This attitude has solidified to the
extent that his films are now casu-
ally dismissed with merely super-
ficial comment. Some have even
been universally panned “Winter
Light,” “All These Women.”

'Bergman is now out of Vogue.
Fortunately, the quality ofhis recent
work has not really suffered as a re-
sult. “The Silence,” while a much
more disillusioned film, is no less

Weekend Double Feature
Proves Half Satisfying

In this rational and skeptical age,
we are apt to belittle the power of
the Medium. Someone whose sensi-
tivity is attuned to the "spirits of
the dead” and who can skillfully
re-create the likeness of those spir-
its, we tend to dismiss out of hand
as a fake.

For doubters, Emlyn Williams’
reading of Charles Dickens last
Friday night should have been a
powerful education in the super-
natural. Williams played Medium
to the Spirit of Charles Dickens,
and the result was a magnificently
bewitching spell cast on the Page
Hall audience.

No Imitation

Unlike Hal liolbrook’s famous
portrayal of Mark Twain, Williams
made no overt attempt to convince
us of Charles Dickens‘ "actual"
presence on the stage. The Dic-
kehsiaii chin-whiskers, the Victori-
nn red-velvet, speaker's stand and
the heavy volumes that Williams
leafed through from time to time,
were less pieces of factual evi-
dence than stepping-stone into the
rich world of Dickens’ creation.

it was a two-man shownil the way:
the 19th Century Eiigiishwriter with
his marvelous sense of character,

 

 

 

 

caricature and the texture ofthe epic
of everyday life; the 20th Century
Welsh actor who with extraordinary
sensitivity and control, breathed new
life into character and caricature
alike and painted the landscape of
Dickens' vision before our eyes.

The ruthless but loving portrayal
of the Veneerings and the Podsnap-
pers (from “Our Mutual Friend")
and the delightful description of the
massive tastes (reflected intiie Pod-
snapper’s silver-set) of an insecure
but “upwardly mobile” faintly
“moving in society” could only have
been re-lold by a person of excep-
tional skill.

Beilevablo Portrayals
Williams had it, and, in my opin-
ion, even surpnssed some of Ruth
Draper’s finest “monologues” in
cronliug n whole gallery of charac-
tors and n thoroughly believable

setting out of his own person.

A "Tale of Two Cities" which by
now most of us feel we should be
out-growing, crime back at us with
unuxpeclcd force. Willinms’ read-
ing has n more powerful evocation

a work of art than “The Virgin
Spring.”

And do not any of the reviewers-

see that "All These Women," like
"The Devil’s Eye,” isjust Bergman
vacationing from the unrelieved de-
pression of his past three films?
Has anyone even tried to correlate
his ideas on art and critics, as
presented. here, with his other
works?

Not To them, Bergman is in
decline, and one need not be con-
cerned with him.

Reverse Process

This process also works in re-
verse, and a number of directors
now held in high esteem have failed
to turn out a good film for some
years. Notable among these is John
Ford, though his recently completed
"Cheyenne Autumn” holds some
promise.

It is just a question oftinie before
such pedestal directors are forced
to descend; indeed, Stanley Kubrick
is about due. After all, whatever
film he makes next will surely be a
letdown after "Strangelove."

Michelangelo Antonioni is already
on the downward curve. Not be-
cause lie has suddenly started mak—
ing poor films — he hasn't - but
because of the nature of fads.

Bandwagon Theory

The starting of these trends is
probably akin to the Bandwagon
Theory. “So-and-so has quite a
reputation; let’s attack him and
make one for ourselves.” “We’ve
got reputations ourselves; let’s at-
tack So-and-so, and see just how
strong our influence is.”

Or even, “His films are really
popular, but I thought he was an
intellectual director; There must
be something wrong with his pic-
tures."

The Bandwagon takes it from
there.

Ignorance is bliss, but to ignore
because others ignore is the height
of folly.

Artists’ Shows Prove Inconsistent

by M. Gilbert Williams

Reviewing the Twentieth annual
Albany Artists’ Group Show how at
the institute of History and Art
is a peculiar mixture of delight
and displeasure. Tire watercolors,
oils, drawings, and sculpture on
exhibit are those ofessentiallyparte
time artists. These are the kind
of people who have been referred
to as "Sunday pointers.”

Tire tradition of such artists is
an enduring port of American life,
and as our society becomes more
and more affluent and finds more
and more leisure time, the number
of such active amateur artists con—
tinues to grow.

What they lack inqunlity isgeiier-
nlly made up in quantity perfor-
mances. Thus it is that all over the
American landscape are landscape
artists. and it is a rnre town these
days which cannot boast of having
llll illitltlill outdoor or indoor “Art
Fair”. Whore the products of its“
townsfolk can be soon in over—
abundance.

Masterpieces to Mediocrity

Fortunately for Albany, and for
those who frequent the Institute
of ilinoi'y lilltl Art, the current
showiny of the AlbanyAi'tisls'Group
lures better than its counlei‘pui‘ts
which are hold in other New York
towns. lint for the few really fine
works shown, there is an over-
whelming number of mediocre
pieces which are truly nniuteurish.

Among the best now on display
is Niles Anderson's sculpture “The
Nun." it is n stylizntion inmetul
of u nun‘s bend and coil, the long
drawn face of which is full of pene-
trating coldness: unforgettable.

Another work, this ttine a water—
color by the talented Miss Gretchen
Weeber entitled “Wild Flowers,”
is n portrayal iii delicate colors
and gentle lacy lines of roadside
flora. Here soft greens and warm
browns create afestlval of harmoni-

ous forms, whose appeal to the eye
is unending.

Finer Points

Other works of excellence on ex—
iiibit include two felt pen drawings
by Robert E. Pearson: one of a
boat in drydock being repaired,
"Never too Old," and one called
“The Bridge to Somewhere.“ Both
are in a pale brown, a color ad—
mirably suited for his subjects. Al-
so worth attention are the two pieces
by Julius Gentaleii, and a simple
decorative oil by Adelina Bindle,
“September Leaves." But that about
finishes the show's finer points.

The other works of which I have
not spoken (and they are many), are
of little interest, even llioiigii seine
have taken prizes. They are a pot—
pourri of styles, ench giving off a
scent of a too familiar relative.
One oil reminds me of u lily pond
done I‘y Monet, only this artist
cluttered up his cativns too much.

Another oil reiuiiids me of one of
those all too sweet portraits by
Marie Lauroncin and would have
pleased mo more if the artist had

Diversity of Inspiration

Other works on display echo Miro,
the Kennes, and paintings from the
covers of "Field and Stream". They
show a diversity of inspiration, but
that does little to save them as
works of art, to be surel

i would not ask that people stop
producing such pieces, but only that
they put an end to such repetitive
public exhibition. For the few truly
fine works one is given the oppor-
tunity to view, the over nbuiidancy
oi mediocre work is annoying. I
might suggest that the show be field
lit-annually, when a greater choice
could be offered from whichaselec-
tion could be made for an exhibit.

I ask you to stop in at the Wash-
iiigion Avenue address of the Insti-
tute before November 15, and have
a little fun, unless you have already
been asked to do so by your art
appreciation professor.

it's riot as bud a showing as the
Albany Arlists' Group has had in
previous yours. but optimistically,
I think they crm produce a much
finer presentation next year.
