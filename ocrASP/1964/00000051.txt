By trusting SiS 26-0; Sniitli E'xcels

Assuring itself of at least a tie for first place,

powerful Potter Club led

by field general Wayne

Smith crushed previously undefeated SLS 26-0 last

Monday in AMIA action.

Quarterback Smith proved

to be unstopable as he engineered all ft. or of Potter's
touchdowns, passing for three and running fora score.

Denny Phillips played a
great game from his end
position, catching seven
passes including a touch-
~down and an extra point.
Dave Sully had a pair of
six-pointers for Potter.

Potter's mammoth “beef-trust"
on the offensive line time and again
opened up huge holes for Phillips
and Sully to burst through for long
ground gains. Potter employed
a three-man defensive line that al-
lowed the secondary extra men which
rendered SLS's passing attack inef-
fective.

Poulng Paces Potter

Potter scored nineteen points in
the first half on a thirty-yard pass
play from Smitlt-to-Sully, a fifteen
yard run by Smith, and Phillip’s
reception of a ten yard Smithstrike.
Late in the final quarter Sully scored
again to give Potter :1 twenty-six
point victory, the biggest margin in
any gamein AMIA actionthis season.

Kappa Beta topped Waterbury 6-0
in Tuesday's AMIA game. Riservato
intercepted a Waterbury aerial to
give K8 the ball at midfield. KB’s
quarterback, Danny Thomas, hit
Pierce with a pass to put the hall
on Waterbury’s seventeen yardline.
Thomas then hit ltiservato for the
games' only touchdown. The extra
point attempt failed.

Tony Riservato and Rick Pierce
played outstanding ball Iroin their
and slots.

Kappa Beta ended the year with a
2-2—1 slate while Waterbury claimed
no victories.

Animals Top Brutal

in "Pygmy" action this week,
the two Waterbury teams met with
Pep Pezzilld's Animals topping Sal
Gambino's Brutes, 12-6.

The Animals amassed their big-
gest point total of the season as
Tom, Palmer and John Wolner
teauiod up twice to account for the
team's two scores. Gena' Rybac-
zowski caught a Louie Lougenot
aerial for the Brutes' six points.

"but without these two, we will defin-

as he rapidly lost ground.

He then put on a determined ef—
fort and passed two Plattsburgh run-

effort Munsey citied him “Runner-

Peds Top New Paltz 3-2
Tsododo Boots 3 Goals

by Ray McCloot
Led by Maurice Tsododo’s three goals and stand-
out defensive play by goalie Ron Hamilton, State’s
inspired soccer team defeated a powerful New Paltz
College team 3-2, last Wednesday night at Bleecker.

Stadium. The Peds took

only nine shots at the

Hawk’s goal; the Hawk defense was led by two All-

American players.

Tsododo scored with only
eleven minutes gone by in
the game on an assist by
Udo Guddat. The Hawk’s
Gene Ventriglia tied the
score at 1:09 of the second
quarter.

With less than five minutes gone
by in the third session Tsododo
scored on a liead-in off a corner
kick by Ed Wolner. State increased
its lead to two goals early in the
final period when Tsododo booted
home a penalty kick.

New Paltz fought back gameiy but
Hamilton repeatedly halted the Hawk
drives with timely save. He had
seventeen saves in the game.

However, with only four andahaif
minutes left in the game Dee Winter
scored to put the Hawks within goal

of the Peds.

New Paliz then went into a ten—man
offensive attack hoping to boot home
the typing goal. But the Peds were
not to be deprived of a victory as
the booters again and again blocked"
Hawk shots. The game ended with
the two teams battling for the ball
in front of Stae’s goal.

Albany fullbacks Len Bergen and
Dick Syzmanski were outstanding,
especially during the late stages of
the game when the Hawks were wag-
ing an all-out attack on State’s goal.

The Feds new sport a 3-4-1
slate and will be seeking a win next
Saturday at Montclair College toput
them at the .500 mark.

Last Saturday the freshman squad
bowed to a strong and swift Col-
gate team, 5—0. Coigate's frosh
are undefeated and are considered
one of the best freshman teams in
the state.

The lynno line on Sports

by Harold Lynne

One story thatemerged from the recently completely
Olympic Games was that of Ranatunge J. Karunananda,
Ceylon’s entry in the 10,000 meter run. He finished
last in the race; Karunanonda was lapped four times,
but he still completed his race. He ran alone, knowing
that all the other runners had already finished the

six-mile run.

The 75,000 Japanese spectators on hand for the day’s
proceedings rewarded him with thunderous applause.

As one Japanese woman was

quoted, “I sawyou running

all alone andl couldn’t keep back my tears. IfeltI
was seeing for the first time the true Olympic spirit.”
This example of sport for sport’s sake is what we

consider the essence of the Olympics.
motto is “Citius, Altius, Fortius”
In the 1964 Olympics, although the com-

Stronger).

The Olympic
(Faster, Higher,

petiiors broke more than half the established Olympic
records, recognition of individqu excellence was sub—
ordinated to the unofficial team championship that
Russia and the United States fought for so vigorously.

The American press’

daily reports of the Tokyo

games was saturated with information about the number
of medals won by the two international powers. Billy
Mills, who scored the most surprising victory of the
Olympics. in the 10,000—meter race, received little
coverage for his outstanding performance because on
the same day the U. S. captured five other gold medals.

Besides playing up

the “team championship" the

American press also spoke of “American domination

of the Olympics."

This conclusion was reached be-

cause swimming and track and field were dominated

by the U. S. However,
ing. cycling,

in gymnastics, wrestling, box—
and weight lifting the scarcity of Ameri-

can medalists was embarassingly evident.

,Dllinistet Speaks
(in civil lliglits:
lliges Assistance

Reverend William Howard Melish,
author of ‘jThe‘ Southern Negro
Freedom Movement" and winner of
the 1955 International Peace Prize
spoke Sunday nigiii under the aus-
pices of the University Freedom
Council.

Having just returned from Mis-
sissippi, where his sonis stillwork-
ing, Meiisli recounted some of his
experiences. He spoke of church
bombings, arrests, harassments,
and hatred.

“We are in a police state,” he

\said, in referring to Mississippi.-

People live there in a continual fear
of the future. He called for help
frotn the outside, if something is to
be done to improve the Negro’s
condition there.

Federal Initiative Needed

The initiative has got to come
from the federal level, he stressed.

Melisli also traced the history of
the Negro civil rights movement in
America. Beginning with the under-
ground railroad and John Brown's
raid, he carried it up through the
foundings of the large civil rights
organizations of today, the NAACP,
CORE, SNCC, and the Southern
Student Organizing Committee.

\ He also traded the change in atti-
tude, rooted always in a desire for
freedom, but taking different forms
through the years.

Booker T. Washington, for ex-
ample, stressed equality of job op-
portunities, and urged Negroes not
to press for political equality.

During the war years, Negroes
found many doors open to them, but
with the return of peace, found dis-
crimination returning also.

Non-violent Resistance Increased
For the last 110 years the em-
phasis has been on changing laws
anti obtaining favorable court de-
cisions. Non-violent resistance has
increased greatly, and the partici-
‘ pation which comes front the “grass
roots" has also been significant,
he explained.

The results have not been astlra-
iiiaiic as the protests, however.
In spite of desegregation orders by
the courts in 1954, i'orexatnple,only
2% of Southern Negro children arc
in mixed clnssi'otniis.

Conant lectures on Keyboard;
Second of Renaissance Series

“One cannot approach music with
the same awe iliatone can use toward
the more plastic arts of painting or
literature," said Robert Conant,
speaking before a large crowd in
Page Hall on Thursday evening.

“With these other arts, we can
come close to the artist’s feel —
by reproducing them fairly accur-
ately by means ofinexpensiveprinis
on paperback editions that convey
his thought to us. With music we
cannot do this, because there is a
performer in the way whoniustper-
foriii lefore we can understand the
composer’s idea."

Dr. Conaiii, Professor of Music
and Curator of Musical Instruments
at Yale University, went oii to sup-
port his views liy giving a recital-
lecture on the “Emergence of the
Keyboard in the SixteentliCentury.”

Muslcol Misunderstonding

By lecturing UH(Zilllliliiillpl'HCtICGS
of the time, and by demonstrating
with examples from recorded litera-
ture, or by playing selections onthe
harpsichord himself, Dr. Conant
corrected several misunderstand-
lugs about Renaissance music and
iiiiptii'tctl new know-lodge iothc over—
ihiw crowd.

"First," said Dr. Conant, “we
should corrch tlic iiiiprcsston lllill

worked mm with vucul ioruis. Ac-
tually them “as n wealth of ill-
sti'uincntnl niusi its well. The role

[Hi this tour tloublc-i'ccd instru—
iiicnts, the composer oi the six—
teenih century could write for no

At this point, llr. Conant played
two selections from recordings in
ticiiionsirttte how the instruments
sounded, although he pointed out
that there are it great iinuiy riii'ii-
culttos in instrument rcconsti'iic-
thin that scholars lil'l‘ only now be-
gitining to solve.

lnstruniants' Influence
Dr. Conant proceeded to tell how
the. various instruments Iiientioneti
effected Ilie style of the keyboard

instruments, which were developing
at this time. Of particular impor-
tance in effecting this style were
the lute and the vial fatniiites. Dr.
Conant here played a recording of
a “Fantasia” by Dowiaitd to show
that that composer was attempting
a polyphony more suited to the key—
board instruments.

Wiili this, Dr. Conant went on to
play several selections to show how
keyboard style actually did develop
in the hiin Renaissance. Titus, a
simple song for virginai betrayed
its lute heritage, while selections
of Byrd and Bull showed the natural
exfoliation of a clear and indepen-
dent keyboard stylc.

Dr. Conant concluded iiislecttire-
recital wiili an encore suite by a
later German composer, ii‘rubergct‘.
