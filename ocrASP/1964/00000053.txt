Coach Munsey commented: “it’s
difficult to be a second runner like
him and to know that your chances
of surpassing your lead man are
pretty thin. However, “Tut” was
always there and was highly respec-
ted by his teammates and op-
ponents."

LeMoyne Offers Big Challenge

As for the meet, New Paltz is
considered the weaker of the three
teams, but LeMoyne will be very
tough. Even though State placed
higher in the LeMoyne Invitational
than LeMoyne, State will probably
be running without the services of
the team’s fifth man. Ken Darmer,
who has serious kneetrouble is a
doubtf ll entry in today’s meet.

Robinson has set a dozen meet
or course records, and still holds
five. He has won the LeMoyne
Invitational Meet twice and has come
in third once. He has never lost
a dual meet.

Robinson, Tuttle Team Leadors

Robinson's nchlvements are even
greater when one considers that he
ran without the benefit of winter (in—
door) track, or spring track, which
many other top runners had.

Dennis Turtle never ran cross-
country in his Homer, New York
high school. Yet bebecame the Peds'
steady and reliable number two
man and co-captain.

The interest of the meet will cen-
ter around the race for first be-
tween Robinson and LeMoyne's
Dill‘:Rippie. Ripple, a fiasin soph-
omore, took first place in the Le-
Moyne Invitational this year to end
Robinson’s skein.

who agrees to eternal damnation
in return for prolonged life, to
enable him to understand Ilie mys-
teries of the Universe.

Mephlstophilis is played by Dan-

terimtion of the devil, who is coil-
tlnuousiy trying to possesstho souls
of men willing to pay that price for
superhuman powers,

The Cathedral provides it good
background, in that it lendsusolnmn
and holy contrast to the basic plot.

VOL. L NO. 31

President Outlines Aims, Plans
for State University Development

The long-vacant offices
of the President of the
State University of New
York are now occupied by
Dr. Samuel B. Gould. The
ASP had the opportunity of
talking with Dr. Gould last
Monday.

inevitably the conversation began
with a reference to Albany’s New
Campus. Dr. Could said that he
was “very pleased” with the living
plans. He was especially impressed
by the elimination of long corridors
and other features of older dormi-
tories which tended to give them an
institutional atmosphere.

He explained that the delays in
construction were tied up with the
Dormitory Authority. Laughing, he
added, “for once the University
itself was not directly involved."

The University is directly in-
volved in a vast expansion pro-
gram, however. Construction is
going on at many units, and en-
rollment at many will double in the
next six years.

Dr. Gould indicated that after
1970 the growth spurt will level
off, and enrollment at most of the
smaller units will stabilize at about
5,000 students. After that, additional
space will probably be provided by
new units.

Definite Goals .

Although he has only been in
office for two months, Dr. Gould
has expressed a definite set of
gonlrs which he hopes to accom-
plisb.

These include strengthening his
staff organization, interpreting the
University to the public, and Illi-
provlng academic facilities. lie
plans to follow a plan of general
decentralization in respect to his
dealings with indivulnai units.

Students Strive to Defeat
Pro-Tuition Legislators

City University students fought
a hard but mainly unsuccessful battle
last weekend to keep pro-tuition
assemblymen from gninlngre-ciec-
tion.

According to an article in the
“New York Post,” November 1,
1064, students distributed leaflets,
drove soundtrucks, and followed the
candidates ovorywhere.

Their efforts were directed
against Assenihlymon Fred W. Prel-
ior John M. Burns, Paul Curran,
Robert F. Kelly, and Anthony P.
Snvuroso. All have voted against
restoring the free-tuition mandate
to the City University. All were re-
turned to the Legislature by the
voters on Tuesday.

Resistance
The students met with many kinds
of resistance to their tacllcs. in
Kelly's district, Jpel Cooper, vice
president of the student council,
reported that the soundtruck they
were driving met one of Kelly's.

We unswm-ed that we were stu-
dents of City University and were
both Democrats and Republicans and
wore hero as students to talk about

"We pulled up alongside their
soundtruck and started to explain
the issue. 'i’heir suuudiruck ans-v
wored buck by saying 'these pinkos
and leftists should go home and
leave Brooklyn ulonel’ "

the issue.

“The racket finally became too
much for the cops. They sent both
trucks away."

The police did not send nwny

another group of students Cillll-
,puignlng in Burns' urea. Again

Cooper gave a report on the 10

student "truth squad” that followed

llurns.

"lie got so annoyed with all this
he asked the police to stop us. They
said we were within our rights.

Discauragomont

Olhcr Assemblyman tried lo dis—
courage the students beforeihcy ho-
gan. l’l‘ollor warned, “You kids
think your going to get something
in my distrlcl, you're wrong. My
voters are going to shut the door
in your lili'ﬂ."

Clll‘l‘illl went further and sent
representatives to stull off the
,plnnned “invasion” of his district.
They tried to engage Cooper and
other lenders in debate, but Cooper
continued the campaign saying. "The
'tlme for debate is over."

CCNY sludents have been leaders
in the anti-tuition light since before
tuition was instituted ut the State
University units. The city SCIIUOIS
do not have tuition as yet, hm the
students are working for u hill
preventing tuition from ever being
imposed.

llis ultimate aim is. to transform
the university from a "loose fed-
eration” into an institution with
“unity of resolve and aspiration.”

Unity Through Autonomy

Although his goals of giving unity
to the university as a whole while
granting each unit a greater (le-
gree of autonomy seemed at first
glance to be in conflict, Dr. Gould
explained that the two goals would
be achieved in different areas.

"1 would like to see units shar-
ing faculty much more,” he said.
He went on to explain his hopes
for a university system where stu-
dents may take courses at differ-
ent S. U. campuses without going
throuin the red tape of transfer-
ring.

Unity of the system would allow
faculty members to teach at dif-‘
ferent campuses,thus allowing more
students to have the benefits of
exceptional knowledge in specialized
fields. Library facilities at each
unit Would be open to any member
.of the system.

"Something More"

Dr. Gould’s aim is to make it
tangibly evident to each student
that he belongs to something more
than a single campus."

EDITOR'S NOTE: The following
Interview was given exclusively
to the editors of the ASP by Dr.
Samuel Gould, president of the
State University of New York, in

the midst of a busy schedule.
He provided a unique insight
Into the broad outlines of new

University policy.

Such fluidity of movement within
the system would require a great
amount of cooperation, he pointed
out. Asked about the difficulties of
determining the acceptability of
grades and credits from unittounit,
he replied:

"i hope as time goes on, we'll
Worry less and less about grade
points, and more and more about
the competence of the student and
his ability to prove it."

He feels that competency tests
should he more widely-employed,
so that a student can receive credit
for a course if he can pass the final
exam, whether or not he has attended
the classes.

Concentration on Specialty
As to the autonomy of each unit,
Dr. Gould remarked, "Autonomy
comes as each unit develops itsown
