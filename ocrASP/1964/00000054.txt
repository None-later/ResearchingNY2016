Loch of Quorum.
Stops Senate

Once again there was no quorum
for the Senate meeting last Wed-
nesday evening. Absent without ex-
cuse were Senators Clark, Coon,
Dibler, Kisiel, and Tucker. Sena-
tors Friedman, Gable, Green, Dal--
mer, and Quartararo were excused.
When asked to comment on the quo-
rum-less Senate, President Johns-
ton said, “The situation is tending
toward the ludricrous; the degree
of responsibility seemingly exer-
cised by some people in this area
is appalling." Lack of quorum de-
layed the announcement by MYS-
KANIA of its decision on the re-
ferrals by William Colgan andSteve
Curti on behalf of the yearbook.

Dr. Randall, a professor at C0-
lumbia University and author of
“The Making of the Modern Mind,
is regarded in many quarters as
one of tits most distinguished of
American philosophers.

Current Series
The first ‘two lectures of the
series were delivered by Dr. George
Boas, emeritus professor of John
Hopkins University, and Robert Co-
nant, curator of the Yale Collection
of Musical Instruments.

Stressing the complexities that
must be dealt with in- analyzing an
intellectual movement, Dr. John
Harmon Randall gave the third lec-
ture of the current Re n at s s an c e
Symposium Monday night in Page
ii.

The , Symposium was organized
.by the Division of Humanities to
present to the University a unique
opportunity for exposure to the var-
ious aspects of Renaissance thought.

‘Interpretationito Period .

said Dr. Randall. .
The Renaissance period, being a

time of great intellectual upheaval,
was also characterized by Dr. Ran-
(tall as being marked by increased
individualism and increased im-
patience with inadequate political,
social, and economic institutions.

Reioctlon
Dr. Randall also arguedthat above
all the Renaissance saw a rejection
of the Aristotelian scientific inter-
ests for more worldly, artistic, and
religious interests. "These changes

Were realized in actions,
thoughts.”
From these changes developed

two great schools of thought. On
the one hand, said Dr. Randall, the
imaginative and religious human-
ists developed; on the other the
scientific humanists appeared.

Dr. Randall cited the authors he
considered to be most representa-
tive of this new synthesis: Murcello
Peccino, founder of the Peatonu
gospel, and Peiodelia Merandoia,
author of the Oration on the Dignity
of Man.

 

the essence of the " ‘ was
the re-discovery of the world and
man's nature have chosen a far
too easy definition.”

Shim Viral

Dr. Randall saw the Renaissance
as stemming from two great shifts
from the synthesis of beliefs and
values that characterized the Middle
Ages. The shifts involved a moral
rejection of the Middle Ages by
men who were not knowledgeable
of their times.

“Today we tend to notice con-
tinuities rather than the shifts,”

1930. For twenty-three consecutive
years they gave regular concerts

programs at the Kaufmann Concert
Hall in the same city have been
popular for the last twenty-five
years.

The Budapest is now Quartet in
Residence at the State University

M _ of New York, at Buffalo, where they
I, Uhave instituted an annual series of

fifteen concerts. The members also
teach their individual instruments,
and conduct classes in chamber
music as well.

Lectures to explain the changes in
