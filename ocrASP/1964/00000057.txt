Once again the annual Campus
I Chest Drive is taking place. it has

been a tradition at SUNYA since
1943 when fifty cents per person
was the goal of the week-longdrive.
Since then, Campus Chest has be-
come synonymous with a week of
fund-raising activities culminated
by a dance.

The purpose of Campus Chest is
to solicit contributions for the fur-
thering of college education through-
out the world. The funds are divided
among the World University Serv-
ice, the National Scholarship Serv-
ice and Fund for Negro Students,
and the Albany Community Chest.

Funds Big Improvements

The funds given to the third re—
cipient, the Albany Commhnity
Chest, are well used for local im—
provements on community ce'nters.

purpose behind the drive. Themes
such as "The World is Our Cam-
pus” in 1958, "Dollars for Diplo-
mas” in 1957, “Students Helping
Students” in 1956,, and “Hands
Across the Sea” in 1953 express
the goals of Campus Chest.

in the past, many diverse ac-
tivities have proven successful in
acquiring the funds for a worth-
while cause. There have been Chi-
nese auctions, dances, boosters in
class colors, films, skits,speeches,
raffles, and card parties, not to
mention many others.

m- recent years, fashion shows
proved to be successful fund raisers.
Students modeled the fashions of
several neighborhood stores, and
outfits were given to the gill and

Your “dump” concerning the Gamma Kap beer party was a little in-
accurate — like 100% wrong. We think this "holler than thou” attitude
has gone to you'r heads — well, why not? There's plenty of room up

there for filler.

SOME PEOPLE NEVER LEARN

Reports of recent Potter and friends activities in O’Heaney's makes
us wonder — when are people going to realize that they can’t keep
getting away with immature actions and last on this campus?

PARADISE LOSES

Utopia has finally been reached - unfortunately the sand, noise,
etc. leave quite a bit to be desired. Some day, maybe, the new campi
will be livable. Maybe those living in motels didn’t have it so bad

after all? :

ASWEGROWUP...

We would like to extend our congratulations to Senate on their appar-
ent rise immaturity. A more businesslike attitude on the floor coupled
with long needed revisions in many sreas,extendedlibrary hours. more

group working in the best interests of the student body and not them-

selves.

proceeds from the admission fee
were given to the Campus Chest
Fund.

Slave Sales
At the Chinese auctions, waiters
and waitresses for the various
houses were auctioned off, as well
as first place positions in regis-
tration lines.

Campus Chest committee mem-
bers canvassed the dorms, group
houses, and sorority and fraternity
houses in an effort to get a con- ‘
tribution from every student. Boos-
ters in class colors were available
for twenty—five cents at booths situ-
ated in Draper. ~

The proceeds from special show-
ings of movies were given to Cam-
pus Chest.

Skits. speeches, and other forms
of entertainment usually got the
drive off to a start in the beginning
of the week, while a dance over
the weekend provided the culmin-
ating attempt to secure funds. Ad-
mission was charged, and girls were
able to buy one half hour extended
hours for twenty-five cents.

Posters Plot Progress

Posters in the peristyles kept:
track of the growth of the funds.
One year a thermometer was used ~
to record the gains of Campus
Chest while in another year it was
a poster depicting student in cup
and gown holding a diploma. As
the contributions increased, the di-
ploma came nearer to his head,
signifying the completion of his
education.

in 1954 there was an All—State
Day, on which were held softball
games, auctions, a card party, and
a square dance.

;| .s’o'viei Hierarchy ’ Shifts

'\

by J. Roger Lee

Hall a month has elapsed since
the fall of Nikita Khrushchev, and
still it is possible only to speculate

. about the new status of various Rus-
’ eian leaders and 'of the USSR itself.

No “hard” analysis may yet be
drawn concerning the future of
either Russia or the world com-
munist movement. Some observa-
tions concerning the coup are in
order,‘however, since they provide
a basis for sane speculation.

First, it is noteworthy that the
abortive reight of Khrushchev
marked the first time that the lead-
ership of a major communist nation
was not in the hands ofa theoreti-
cian. Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Tse-
tung have all written on the philos-
ophy of dialeticai materiaism.

The foreign policies of these
three men have all been faithful
to the phllosophy’s comment to
spread the revolution. These items
become noteworthy in‘ light of the
fact that one of the key figures in
both the coup and in the subsequent
power struggle has been the Rus-
sian Communist Party theoretician,
Mikhail Suslov.

Stalinist:

Suslov has been a rallying figure
for the Stalinist factions of the
CPSU. It was he who delivered the
four hour indictment at the Central
Committee meeting which ousted
Khrushchev from his post of party
leadership.

Another interesting fact that was
slow to come to light was the in-
volvement of Marshal Rodion Malin-
ovsky in the October coup. MallnT
ovsky has often been one of the
more outspoken of the hard line
anti-Americans. In Khrushchev’s
time, it was usually Malinovsky’s
oratory that "rattled the rockets."

Molotov

The National Broadcasting Com-
pany. hearing that Khrushchev had
been seen alive on the streets of
Moscow, sent a camera crew to
get pictures of the deposed leader.

The cameraman patrolled the area
around the government and party
offices where Khrushchev would be
likely tobe found, but the ex-premier
was nowhere to be found. However,
they did see' and photograph a post-
coup returnee ,to Moscow named
Vyacheslav Molotov.

Molotov, Stalin’s foreign minis-
ter, is the old bolshevik who is
without doubt the most influential
Stalinist in the Soviet Union. Khru-
shchev had to defeat him in his
rise to pOWer after Stalin's death.

He later had him read out of the
party in 1957 but Molotov is back
in Moscow, and his presence adds
another portentous factor to the
struggle for power.

Mao

One of the unknown factors in
the communist movement is the in-
fluence' of Mao Tse-Tung. The wes-
tern press has not indicated any
involvement of the Chinese revolu-
tionary in the events of the last
month. And yet, it would be inane
to suppose that he has remained
inactive in the face of recent de-
veiopments.

Mao and Khrushchev had been
fighting for control of the appara-
tus -'- the world communist move-
ment. Khrushchev had fallen and
Mao would be foolish not to exploit
the weakness of the newly formed
Russian leadership. No sane ob—
has ever considered Mao
Tse-tung to be a fool.

server

It seems to this writer that if
Brezhnev and Kosygin are to re-
main in power, they will have to be

ideologically sound, which means,

that they will effect a degree of
re-stalinizatlon.

The figures behind the coup are
too powerful for them to act other-
wise. Failure to re-stalinlze would
put Kosygin and Brezhnev up against
a formidable power block led by
Molotov, Malinovsky and Suslov. The
probable outcome of such a con-
frontation would be the transfer of
leadership to Mikhail Suslov.

Xavier Pickets New Playboy Club

In a recent ramble down Huckle-
berry Road, we happened on this
piece from the “Xavier News."

Student Playboys

Seventeen students from Xavier
University, Cincinnati, Ohio, silent-
ly marched in front of the city’snew
Playboy Club for two hours, carry-
ing signs with such slogans as “l-iide
from Reality Here“ and “Do You
Want Your Daughter to be a Play-
mate?"

The leader of the group, Thomas
Conway, a sophomore from Cleve-
land, said the demonstrators ob-
jected to the presence of the key
club because of its connection with
“Playboy Magazine," which he de-
scribed as "pornographic trash.“

The “Xavier News,” a campus
newspaper, said one of the students

distributed a mlmeograpn sheet,

which rend as follows:

“In plcketiug Playboy Club, we
as university students wish to point
out flint the entire Playboy phil-
osophy not only opposes the basic
Judeo-Chrlstian principles of our
society buisopenly advocates their
overthrow. We decry Hugh Hefner's
“new morality." It is nothing but
plain old immorality.

Bunnies Bring Business

"It has been stated that the pres-
ence of a Playboy Club will bring
more business to Cincinnati. What
kind of business? Have we reached
such a ridiculous impasse that the
development of downtown Cincinnati
depends on overgrown "boys" ogling
"bunnies."

its daring pictures. A Playboy Club

Inote the “Playboy” magazine.

“Pornography, no matter how so-
phisticated it claims to be,is nothing
more than filth — a filth whose
stench is repulsive and whose ad-
vocates are corrupters.”

- Not Immoral
Arnold Morton, Vice President
‘-of Playboy Club International, told
reporters that "the presence of the
pickets was embarrassing to some
of our guests. We arenotimmoral."

He added: "The leader (Conway)
has never been inside a Playboy
Club. He reflects an uninformed
attitude of emotional blindness. He
is doing what he has been told to
do by adults.”

Subsequently,
student council voted, nine to four,
against officially sanctioning the
actions of any volunteer group of
Xavier students in such a protest.

But Conway and his band of vol-
unteers vowed to continue their
efforts. '

The Art Council, last year at
this time a dream, is now an in-
fant realityxA mere handful of
students and Mr. Edward Cowley,
chairman of the Art Department,
worked out plans for the estab-
lishment on SUNYA’s campus of
anindependent organization devoted
to the sponsorship of art lectures
and exhibitions.

Last semester a constitution for
the Council was successfully passed
through Senate, and a first year’s
budget was draWn up which (though
trimmed in budget hearings) allows
the council to bring four speakersto
SUNYA this year, and several loan
exhibits. In additidn the Council has
a small sum for the purchase of
original works of art‘which will be
housed as apermanentartcollection
in a separate operating gallery on
the new campus.

3 Functions

Thus it is that the Council has
three main functions: to sponsor
lectures on art subjects by prom-
inent artists, art critics, and art
historians; to provide a continuous
display of art on the third floor
area known as the “Draper Gal-
lery” for all students to view; and
to purchase original art creations
by both contemporary artists and
by those of the past.

The "Council has at present a
membership of about twenty stu-

who are mu members and inter-

(as stipulated by the Council’s- con-
stitution) the completion of one aca-
demic semes‘ter before they can
become fullﬂedged members. The
only other requirement for Council
membership, in addition to the one
academic semester clause, is that
the interested student has an un-
failing devotion to making art avail-
able to the entire student body.

At present the council is busy
working out next year’s budget, try-
ing to revise its constitution, and
making ready to purchase some
original works of art. All of this
work is being carried out via coin-
mittees.

History at Art Activities

it would be somewhat unfair if
i said that all of these programs
are completely new to thls'cam-
pus. For though such art activities
had not been previously sponsored
by an independent organization,
there is a history on this campus
of the activities now sponsored by
the Art Council.

For several years under the aus-
pices of the Dramatic and Arts
Council (now divided into the Art
Council and The University Dra-
matlcs Council), lectures and ex-

art had been carried 'on, though,
needless to say, to a much more
limited degree.
Pruning Need

Usually no more than two speak-
ers could come a year, only one
loan exhibition was a rental collec-
tion, and about one work of art was
purchased. it was because this pro-
gram was felt to be too limited for
a school the size oftheStateUniver-

sity at Albany, that several students.

and myself saw the pressing need
for a separate organization solely
devotedto art. \

It is the Council’s sincere desire l

to see all of State’s students par-
take ln the Council-sponsored
events, and that a good number of
you win wish to join the council
and keep this youngster growing
stronger year after passing year.

All of the Council’s members
realize the responsibility they have,
for they are spending monies given'
them through your student tax. Thus,
the Council seeks to please you,

and to stir you with the exciting.

worlds of art.
First Exhibition

It was only recently that the
first loan exhibition sponsored by
the Council opened. That show is,
of course, the fifty prints of Al-
brecht Durer. in the months to
come you will see in Draper Gal-
lery such shows as the Prints of
Leonard Baskin, an exhibit of Pop
Art applique banners, the linocuts
of Stanley Wyatt, and many other
exhibitions.

Of more immediate interest are
the two forthcoming lectures spon-
sored by the Council. On November
20, at 1:30 in Draper 349, author
and editor, Mr. Peter Blake, will
give an illustrated lecture on his
recently published book , “God's Own
Junkyard.”

On Monday evening, December ill,
Mr. Horst Jonson will give in lower
Brubacher lounge at 8:30, an illus-
trated lecture on the Renaissance
sculptor, Donatello.

We of the Council invite you to all
of our programs, and hope this ex-
panded organization meets your de-
mands for good art education coli-
tinually.

Daniels Challenges Jensen: ‘Herzog’

by Bruce Daniels

it is Just one of the ironies of
Soul Bellow's "Herzog" that it
seems to be a smashing success.
Not that we should fault Bellow for
his good fortune alone, but there is
something about the marriage ofthe
Culture Industry and a Good liepu-
tatiou that must make us uneasy.

And, further, the book itself is a
repudiation of the very people who
will gobble it up and bet it about at
cucktail parties.

One miqu have predicted some
weeks before the book appeared on
the stands that it would be a best-
seller. Bellow, belng a “name”
and thus a highly saleable com-
modity,’ might — if he wanted to —
publish his grocery list and keep
his reputation intact.

Even so, the full mechanism of
promotion was brought to hear on
"Herzog" and sections of the book
were sneak-previewed not only in
“Commentary” but in the "Satur-
day Evening Post!"

Guaranteed Success

To cap it all off, "Herzog" was
rapturously reviewed in the "N.Y.
Times Book Section" as its front-
page Great Book of the Week —
and followed in the same issue by
a disgusting little portrait of the
Genius in a Lighter Moment. How
could "Herzog" miss?

in an attempt to become the
"Lovejov of his generation," Her-

zog sets out to work on a second
study of Romanticism - a Grand
Synthesis which he abandons and
finds that. in his dawdling. he has
been scooped by another scholar.

From this he turns to writing
fitful fragmentary letters shot
through with petty spleen and flashes
of insight. By the end of the book
he has abandoned even this and
has the profound silence of ex—
hnustlon.

This disintegration of rationality
is interwoven with the story of
Herzog‘s failures in his animal
life: he is cheated sexually by his
wife Madeline and his best friend
and protege Valentine Gersbach.

Futile Attempts

He is unable to make connection
with his past and is cut off irrevo-
cably from his family. His various
attempts at eroticism fail because
llerzog is simply not built that way.

Even Ramona, whom we feel at
times is Herzog's only hope to re-
establish contact with the human
world, is transformed by iierzog's
own ironic intelligence into some
kind of exotic monster— at once
larger and less than life.

The characters of Madeline and
Gersbach are (besides Herzog's,
of course) the most superbly and
subtly rendered creations in the
book. Madeline, particularly, has
been singled out as lifeless-too
much a “type” and not enough 'a
fully—realized human being.

llr. teech’s lecture Cancelled

The Renaissance Symposium Committee announced

But we must remember that both
Madeline and Gersbach are crea-
tunes of Hei'zog‘s moral universe—
and in a moral universe (whether
we call them “daemons” or "hu-

mours”) types and perfectly at
home.
