WSUA is already looking toward
its future on the new campus. The

in construction will make this im-

The station itself will move to
the new campus in 196'? and will
present a full day’s schedule.

final game of the season against an always powerful C. W. Post College team.
The game will be played on Saturday afternoon at20'clock; the-pads W111 be

staying in a hotel on Long Island tonight. Last, year State hosted the game against

Post and was a 3-2 winner in a tense and exciting contest.

Post is an especially
tough team as it contains
several foreign born play—
ers. State has been plagued
by injuries and Luis Os—
pina and Udo Guddat have
been sidelined.

State will have to rebound alter
last week’s defeat io Monlclair,
5-1. The team’s defense was week
and forced goalie Ron Hamilton to
make thirty-two saves.

Guddat scored two goals for the
Peds in last year’s victory in which
State was offensively strong in the
first half but was forced to take to
defense by an aroused Post squad
in the second half.

This year has been a season of
frustration and.surprises for'the
Peds. Two of the team’s losses
came in overtime as did the one
tie. The hooters were soundly de—
feated by Brooklyn College (6—0)
and by Moniclair College (5-1);
they smashed Utica College 11-1
and trimmed New Paltz and Oneonta,
both by 3-2 scores.

The Utica victory came after the
Doctors had been held scoreless for
284 minutes of play. Maurice Tso—
dodo and Ed Wolner led the State
attack in that contest, scoring four
and three goals respectively.

Coach Garcia expects tomorrow’s
contest to be evenly matched, and he
feels that if the Peds passing game
can click, as it did against New
Paltz and Utica, State should be
able to win. The defense should be
solidified with the return of co-
captain Luis Qspina. Ospina, a full-
back, was lorced to sit out last
week’s Montclair game due to an
ankle injury.

WAA Hockey Team

Bows to Casileton

The hockey team played its first
Varsity game at Castleton State
Teacher’s College in Vermont on
Friday, October 30. The final scbre
was 2-1 in favor of Castleton. Barb
Russell scored State’s only- goal.

Karen Bock, Beth Boyd, and Pris-
cilla Gurney, under the supervision
of Mrs. Mann, comprised the first
women's physical education class
to use the facilities on the new
campus-Thursday, October 20. They
practiced on the new tennis courts
to prepare for the scheduled match
against Oneonta. However, due to
Oneonta’s lack of practice and In-
terest, the match was cancelled.

Recently, Sue Emhorsky, as
Slate’s representative, attended the
10th annual conference of the Stale
Athletic and Recreation Federation
of College Women at Upton Hall,
State University College at Buffalo.
.Along with representatives from
eleven other units of the Slate Uni-
yersily System, she spent the week-
end of October 23 discussing the
Importance of athletics and listen-
ing to lectures on leadership qual—
itles.

   

 

PILEUP AGAINST NEW PALTZ is typical of the action in the

I.

 

T964 soccer season. Peds sport 3-5-1 record going into tomor-

row's finale.

Joe Renting Sparks

Much of the credit for the suc-
cess of this year’s frosh cross-
country team must go to Joe Kent-
ing, a quiet-mannered runner from
Glens Falls. Joe, who graduated
from St. Mary’s Academy of Glens
Falls last June, won seven of the
eight Insets that he competed in this
season; the team compiled a 5-3
record.

Cross-country Coach ll. Keith
Munsey emphasized Keatlng’s abil-
ity to analyze his own strengths and
weaknesses as an important factor
in the freshman’s outstanding rec:

"He is quick to spot a critical
area In a race and he will generally
profit by mistakes,” Coach Munsey
said. Joe, while viewing films of
one of his races this season, spotted
an error in his stride. lie corrected
this flaw and since then he has been
able to maintain better rhythm in
his running, and thus improve his
speed.

Coach Munsey, looking ahead to
next year said, "i am positive that
Joe will be a great asset to the
varsity squad next fall. He has
strength and substantial amount of
speed, and this coupled wiihastrong
desire to win makes him a line
runner.”

Joe is majoring in biology. By
planning his time well he has been
able to do well in his studies while

excelling in cross-countrv.

«n ».

Until Tuesday’s meet against LeMOyne College and
New Paltz, in every dual meet that the cross-country
team had participated over the past two years Tom
Robinson‘had been the first man to cross the finish
line. On Tuesday afternoon, in Tom’s lastcollege dual
meet, his fantastic fifteen—meet wining streak was

' brought to a close by Bill Ripple, LeMoyne’s flashy

sophomore.

Ripple, whom cross-country coach Keith Munsey
termed “the best college distance runner that l have
ever seen” broke Tom’s Washington Park course
record by 30 seconds. However. State was still bite
to capture team honorsin the meet due to a sweep
of the second through fifth positions by Robinson,
Dennis Tuttle, Bob Flick, and John Clark respective-
ly.
The Peds actually garnered two dual meet victories'
as A lbany-LeMoyne and Albany-New Paltz were each
scored as dual meets.

Since cross—country meets are scored on the basis
of the first five finishers for each team, Ken Dar—
mer’s twelfth place was very important; Darmer was
a doubtful starter for the race because he had been
sidelined with a leg injury the previous week. If
Ken’s sore legs had not held up‘over-the grueling
4.55-mile course, the team’s undefeated record would
have ended a fifteen straight as Robinson’s did.

Immediately after the meet Coach Munseyinformed
the harriers that AA Board had voted to send them to
the NCAA College Division Championship Meet held
in Wheaten, lllinois November 14.

This opportunity to compete against the top college
teams in the country is certainly well deserved and
we are confident that the team will turn in a fine
showing. -
