Finishing their season undefeated. the cross-coun-
try tea‘m defeated LeMoyne and New Paltz in a
triangular meet held Tuesday in Washington Park.

The . Peds accumulated 26

points to LeMoyne’s 35

and New 'Paltz’s 66. 'Tom Robinson failed to win for
the first time in three years on the Washington Park

Course.

He was defeated by Le-
Moyne’s Bill Ripple who
finished the course in the
record—breaking time of
24:14.4, 30 seconds faster
than the old record set.

Robinson, Dennis Tuttle and Bob
Flick finished 55 seconds behind
Ripple to notch the 2nd, 3rd and
4th spots for Albany. John Clark

Potter Club Shoals for Tenth
Straight AMIA Title Tomorrow

Tomorrow at 2:00 on University Field the AMIA
play-off game for the league championship will be
played betWeen champion Potter Club and challenger
APA. The two clubs were thrown into a tie via APA’s
forfeit win over Trinity last week. Potter finished
the year with a 4-1 record, while APA went unde-

feated in a 3-0-2 record.
Potter Club has won the
championship for fourteen
years, the last nine in a
row. Potter lost the crown
in 1954 to a team of war

veterans called the Vets.
,APA defeated Potter back in the
second week of the league, 14-16,
and continued on to defeat Kappa
Beta and Trinity. lt tied Water-
bury and SLS. '

Potter is led by ﬂashy quarter-
back Wayne Smith, and ends Ray
Weeks and Denny Phillips. The com-
bination of Smith to Weeks and
Phillips provided Potter with the
most overwhelming majority of the
team’s scores and extra points.

Blocking backs Dave Sully and
Dick Moore were invaluable in
catching screen passes and picking
off blitzers before they could reach
the quarterback.

APA's offense is led by quarter-
back Don Prokup and ends Mike
Goldstein and Steve Zaharak. APA
uses a balanced attack with Zahur-
ak and Goldstein forlnlng the aerial
threat and backs Rick Genero and
John Hatallng the ground game.

APA's defense is tight and rugged
and should give Potter’s passing
game a good battle. Tile secondary
is led by John Buckholder and Bob
Baret.

The game should be a hard fought
and well-balanced, pitting Potter's
powerful offense against APA’sten-
nclous defense.

Maurice dribble a soccer ball or

Robinson Hurt

The race between Robinson and
Ripple'was close until about a mile
and a half to go when Robinson
suffered a stitch in his side. Ripple
then pulled ahead to stay. It seemed
doubtful that Robinson would be
able to finish until teammates Flick
and Tuttle caught up and gave him
the encouragement to continue.

Robinson had faced Rippleearlier
in the season at the LeMoye invi-
tational. in that meet Ripple was
running on his home course and

defeated Robinson by 14 seconds.

Dormer Cited

The big question before the meet
was "would Darmer’s knees hold
out?" He had been troubled most
of the season especially in recent
weeks. He went into the mee't after
having been out of practice for the
last eight days, but came through
to clinch the Harriers tenth con-
secutive dual meet victory of the
season.

anization Workshop

Previous government reorganiza—
tion work and conferences have
dealt with abstract principles and
basic forms of structure.

Structure to be Discussed

This workshop will deal withspe-
cities. Actual strln'lure, function,
and make—up of councils Will be
considered. Also considered will
be further structural implications
of the evolved thinking about gov-
ernnlenl purposes.

This will be accomplishedthrough
a consideration of how all presently
existing student organlzntions will
fit into the new pattern that is de—
veloping.

It is hoped that the session Will
give all organizations nn opportun-
fly to catch up with the growth of
student gol’el'mnenl philosophy as
il affects grollps’ tunrtlomng and
to dlsruss specific needs for rep»
resenlntion \vllhln a new studenl
government structure.

Members of the steering l'oln-
miltec that has been considering
government reorganization have ex-
pressed the need for all all-campus
dialogue for cumnllnlir'atinn, co-
operation and mutual advisement in
a workshop such as this as well us
within the governnlcm.

The Workshop will also attempt to
explore the ways that government
can be brought to a meaningful level
for llll campus organizations sotllnt
they may function for the benefit of
all students in the University.
