Potter to 19-0 win over APA.

sroav or THE GAME '- Wayne Smith passing and running

Potter tops Tenth Straight Title;
Smith Paces 19-0 Win over APA

Led by the passingand runningof quarterback Wayne
Smith, Potter Club rolled over APA 19-0 in the AMIA
championship playoff game Saturday on University

Field.

Smith, who was given tremendous protection

all afternoon by his offensive line, completed seven of
seventeen passes for a total of 126 yards and ran for

108 more.

With this victory Potter
maintained the AMIA foot-
ball championship which it
has held for the past ten
years. In the last sixteen
years the Club has won the

title fifteen times.

APA began the game as though it
was going to be their day. On the
first play from scrimmage Don
Prockup, the Alpha’s quarterback,
ran for 88 yards to the Potter
seventeen-yard line. However, Pot-
ter's defense stiffened and the Club
toolr over the ball on downs on the
eleven-yard stripe.

88-Yord Touchdown March

APA held Potter with a strong
defensive pass rush, but after re-
gaining the ball it could not sus-
tain an offensive thrust and was
forced to punt. Jim Wingage boomed
a beautiful thirty—yard punt which
rolled out of bounds on the-Potter
two-yard line.

  

to! 20-yd. gain.

POTTER END DENNY PHILLIPS grabbing pan from Smith

The Club then marched 88 yards
in eight plays for a touchdown (the
AMlA field is only 90 yards long).
With long passes to Dick Moore
and Denny Phillips, Smith moved
Rotter to the eleven-yardline where
he threw to Dave Sully for the touch-
down. Smith tossed to Moore for the
extra point.

Breaker-Potter Tallies Again

After the ballhadexchanged hands
twice, Phillips intercepted an APA
pass and ran it back to the Alpha’s
fourteen-yard line. Smith fired to
Len Sneddon for the touchdown. Pot-
ter was stifled in its extra point
attempt and the score at the half"
was 13-0.

The Club received the second
half kickoff and two plays later‘
had another score. The touchdown
was set up by Smith’s 25-yard
pass to Dick Moore which put tiie
bail on the APA nineteen. Smith

took the ball around left end and
went in for the score. The extra
point was missed and the score
stood at 19-0.

ALBANY 3. NEW YORK

.“boni to Participate 

In Notional Teacher Study

The State University at Albany’s School of Edu—
cation is one of four university units in the country
which will be studying teacher evaluation methods
under .a $266,000 grant from the United States Office
of Education. The project, which viill run for four
years in close cooperation with the New York State
Education Department, will include the University
of Wisconsin: Sacramento State College, California;
Northwestern University, Chicago, and SUNY at Al-

bany.
The project will field-
test a new methodof teach-

,Vg er certification. Certifi-

cation would be based on
judgments of student teach-
er competence in class-
room performance, rather
than on courses, grades,
and credits.

The design’for the ’program is
based on recommendations made
by James B. Conant, president em-
erlius, Harvard University, in his
,study on teacher education.

All participating units will co-L

operate with public school and State
education department personnel as
Well as with the other university
units.

H The first phase of the program
involves the selection, organization,
and training of observer judges,and
the establishment of observation
techniques.

The second phase includes obser-
vations of the selected senior teach-
ing candidates, in classroom per-
formance, in clinical pro-service
performance, and in academic per-
iforinance and personal traits.

Phase three of the study will fol-
low the certified candidates io iii-
servlce teaching to determine the
accuracy of the judgment made.
