 Thomson. . . .plcase.’ ”

Please tell me how you manage

to make me look so great on campus.
The only thing I can’t pass now

is a crowd of boys. Those vertical
stretch pants follow the

sleek line of most resistance.

And guarantee the least resistance

on ‘campus. Thcn, total recovery

(only the pants, Mr. Thomson, not the boys) .
The reﬂex action of your

proportioned stretch pants

is second only to the rcllcx action

of that Psych major I’ve had my eye on.
And the lit! Mr. Thomson, please,

how did you get them to fit so well?

I adore you, Mr. Thomson!
