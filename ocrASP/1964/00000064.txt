Though the key, element in the‘
motion picture industry is the film

 "product" itself, it is to the theatre

building's themselves that attention
at times must be paid. Conscioust
or not, theatres do bias a viewer.-

Albany boasts a total of six movie
theatres. "

Of. these, the one claiming to be
the "Capital District's‘Most Beau-
tiful Theatre" is the Hellman. Lo-
cated far out on Washington Ave-
nue, it' is currently the most in-
convenient for State students.

But with the transfer to our new
compile, 'it will become the most
accessible of all. _

This is actually unfortunate, due
to. its general policy. of 'showing
road show reserved-seat attrac-
tions such as "Cleopatra" and “My
Fair Lady." As a result, the films
become intrenched for a run of a
month or two.

This, combined with the extra-
high admission prices of such shows
(with the Hellman's prices always
rising on weekends) would tend to
eliminate the theatre from weekend
dater's consideration.

Even between long runs, when the -

Hellman shows normal, first-run
films, prices are steep.

I'er Design
In addition, the theatre was poorly
designed in a practical sense. The

seating area is so deep that anyone a

sitting near the back feels himself
to be a.mile from the action on the
screen. This unnatural length seems
intended to make up for the space
lost by having no balcony.

This depth would be less of a
problem if the screen were larger.
As it is, the front quarter of the
seats is really the only area com-
parable io a normal theatre.

This is especially a problem when
a film in Cinerama is shown. The
screen is so small, and the theatre
so long, that the only place where

“the peripheral vision inherent in

process can be felt is, again, in
the first few rows of seats.

Oddly enough, these best seats
in the house are nearly always
available, as most audiences clus-
ter protectively near the rear.

Though doors at the head of each
aisle isolate the theatre from the
lobby, they are so arranged that
when during a matinee anyone (and
there are always many)uses the door
the sunlight from outside projects
an outline of the door and the
image of the person onto a sub-
stantial portion of the screen. At
evening performances, the same is
true with auto headlights.

The Delaware is our local Art
theatre, and as a rule does a com-
mendable job. Though it steers clear
of the more "far out" films. such

 

as those of Jean-Lilo Goddll'd, it
provides .a supply'of generallygood-
foreign films. ' '
In recent years, it has also be-
come "mired in the "Carry On’;
British comedies, thus eliminating-
from consideration aweekthatcould
have been devoted to 'a worthwhile

film. This defect has shown no signs-

of rea‘ppearing this year.

Though playing to a generally
“select” audience of college stu-
dents and sophisticated Albanians,
the theatre also attracts a number
of .neighborhood high school stu-
dents who. go there because it is
the nearest theatre.

Leland Theatre
The Leland can be easily elim-
inated , although it occasionally hides
a good film as the lower half of a
double bill with the likes of "Blaze
Starr Goes Back to Nature."
"The Concrete Jungle," a five-

Emu!

 

[year-old film made by Joseph Lo-M

sey ("The Servant") and starring

.Staniey Baker (“Zulu”) was one of

these prizes that appear about once
a year. -

The Madison fills the need of re-
playing double features of'recent
worthwhile films. Unfortunately, it
tends to tamper with the prints of
the films. The entire pro-credits
opening sequence of "From Rus-
sia, With Love” was missing when
shown there.

The Strand and the Palace, our
two main first-run theatres, have
no great advantage". They are neat
(usually) and practically designed,
lacking the difficulties of the other
theatres.

They also have no substantial
disadvantages, and are similar both
in the movies they show and the
kind of building they show them in.
Thus, referring ‘to the physical
plant, these two are the best in the
city.

Point: 'Counterpoint’

by Robert Judd

To date there have been three
issues of “Counterpoint,” with a
fourth being prepared, and a fifth
being planned, as of this writing.
So far, "Counterpoint" has been
neither a total success, nor a total
failure.

The paper was conceived of a
month ago by William Morgan and
myself as a way to raise the cul-
tural level of our University, and
at the same time, as a way to make
money for a film-making project,
which the newspaper will sponsor.

We decided that a newspaper would
enable us to make enough money to
begin production o'f, the film by
Thanksgiving: and that a good news-
paper would make more money than
a bad one.

The format is quite simple: a
weekly interview (so far we have
been fortunate enough to interview
Judy Collins, folksinger, and Dr.
Eurian and Dr. Berger ofour Drama
and Education Departments respec-
tively) in addition to critical essays,
reviews, science, art, and music
articles, and similar materials.

We have tried to avoid editorial-
izing, explaining, and pleading —
hoping instead that the paper would
speak for itself.

' Positive Philosophy
Rather than degenerating into a
gripe sheet or announcement bulle-
tin, we have tried to maintain a
"positive" philosophy, coupled with
works of high calibre.

the State University Bookstore, and
others have given us a great deal
of advice and encouragement, which
we both need and want. ,

The student body, disturbingly
enough, has had rather negative
attitudes toward “Counterpoint,”
Many students accept a copy as they
might a blessing from a leper;
others, violently displaying their
individualism and fear, refuse to
even look at a copy.

Hostility

We expected a good deal of apathy
and aloofness from the students,but
not the outright hostility which has
been shown. We can only hope that
the demand will grow and that pre-
judices will be iessend as more
and more students learn of the paper.

"Counterpoint" is free, but we are
supported by donations, with any
profits used for expansion of the
paper, and the making of" films and
books of photographs. '

Written contributions maybe sub-
mitted to the editors through Stu-
dent Mail.

Future issues hopefully will con-
tain feature articles on special
schools in New York State, dormi-
tory living, visions, in addition to
interviews with people both on and
off the University campus.

GOPUhcleur 0.. Rights

by .l. Roger Lee

The October 18 edition of this
column bemoaned the fact that Sen-
ator Goldwater was not waging an.

ideological campaign. It was ob-

served that "Senator Goldwater may
lose many votes that are rightfully
his if he does not educate the
people of the country as to what he
is and what he stands for.”

The election of 1964 Was an ig-
nominious rout — Lyndon Johnson
by 'a sixty-one percent majority.
But this need not have been the
case. Senator Goldwater should have
won.

In fact, incredible as it may
seem, Goldwater should have car-
ried New York and California.

Proposition 14

In California, the people voted
the Goldwater ideology on Propo-
sition 14, but they did not vote for
Goldwater. The initiators of Prop-
osition 14 were concerned Cali-
fornia voters who decided to re-
assert their claim to property rights
in the face of the "civil rights"
offensive.

Their proposition would reaffirm
the individual’s right to control his
own property. it says, "Neither the
state nor any subdivision or agency
thereof shall deny, limit or abridge,
directly or indirectly, the right of
any person who is willingor desires
to sell, lease or rent any part or
all of his real property, to decline
to sell, lease or rent such property
to such person or persons as he in
his absolute discretion, chooses."

This emphasis on individual rights
is the key to the Goldwater position
on civil rights. And yet, because of
the fact that Senator Goldwater did
not make his ideological commit-

  

 

ment to individual rights clear to
the voters during the campaign, the
same people Who carried the state
for Proposition 14, failed to carry
it for Goldy/ator.

New York _

The same thing happened in New
York State on November 3.

Governor Rockefeller decries the
fact that Barry Goldwater is not in
the. "mainstream" of American
thought. That is, unlike most politi-
cians, he does not favor expanded

governmental assistance at the ex-.

pense of the individual’s right to help
himself.

Governor Rockefeller endorsed an
expansion of the New York State pub-
lic housing program. Amendment 1

and Proposition 1 on the Novembera ,

ballot would have enlarged that pro-
gram in the best tradition of the
Democratic-Moderate Republican
“mainstream” concensus of
thought.

The New York State voters, how-
ever, rejected Barry Goldwater, the
only alternative to this concensus,
on the same day sent the Rocke-
feller housing program down to de-
feat. Had New York voters voted
their ideology in the presidential
column, Barry Goldwater would have
carried New York State.

Ideology

if a representative of thephiloso-
phy of liberty is to win a national
election, he must run on that phil-
osophy. As it was Goldwater tried
to beat Johnson at his own game.

The Democrats and the Moderate
Republicans have had more than
thirty-two years to sell their ide-
ology to thepeopie. Barry Goldwater
had two months and he failed to use
them efficiently.

The relatiohship between art and

the library is, in American society,
a most unusual affair'._lt is anaffair
in American culture of some dura-
tion, and has fortunately tended to
enrich our landscape.
‘ In the nineteenth century, when
Americans *felt so terribly self-
conscious of their lack of culture,
Athenoums both public and private
were established with the purpose,
of fostering the love for the world's
literatures and arts.

Extensive collections were made.
in both fields.-,Paintings and sculp-
tures were as ardently sought for
as manuscripts and letters. Though
at first European arts were over-
whelmingly collected , libraries pur-
chased oriental works of art and
works by American artists.

Athenoum Movement
Of course it was only in larger
population centers, where wealthy

patronage existed, ‘that America's ‘

'Atheneum movement developed. In
:Hartford, Connecticut, site of the
Wadsworth Atheneum, and cities
like Boston and New York, museum-
like edifices were erected.

In the late 1800's, such wealthy
individuals as J. Pierpont Morgan
and Henry Huntington, formed pri-

. vate collections without equal on

the American continent, which have
in recent years been opened to thel
public and to serious scholars. '

Public Demand
During the time that such notable
collections were being established
public libraries were formed
throughout America. With the rise

'Doclor Fuustus’ f

by Bruce Daniela

it is a long way to travel be-
tween the Elizabethan Age and our
own; there is an even greater dis-
fence to cross between our ordi-
nary conception of the scientist
“challenging nature” and Christo-
pher Marlowe's vision of the hero-
vii-lim Dr. Faustus. The Univer-
sity Theatre's first major produc-
tion of the year, Marlowe’s "Faus-
tus," opened last Monday night at
All Saints Cathedral — and to the
handful of communicants in the open-

ing~night audience, came across
quite well.
Director Jnrkn Burian, when

asked aboul the relevance of Mar-
lowe’s play for our time, said in a
recent "Counterpoint" interview
that simply riding in an airplane can
provoke "in some smull way" in-
iimations oi the Faustino spirit.
Suspended, as it were, between
Heaven and Earth -- one might well
feel a simultaneous pride (in man's
mastery over nature) and terror
(the utter helplessness of knowing
that at any moment the laws of
God -- or Nature — mny (:npl'lc-
lously reverse themselves and
strike us down.)

Now. ordinarily, we don't feel
that way at all, A plane ride is a
plane ride. it is a passive Faust,
indeed, who unfastens his seat belt
and thinks he challenges God. 0r
who ran imagine an aviation de-
signer for Douglas Aircraft signing
a blood-par with Sutnn in order to
create a better DC-B?

With_Mnrlowe, we go back to a
time where Man, in order to es-
tablish his own dominion on Earth,
had to wrest control from a terrible
and powerful incumbent — God. To
pry into nature's secrets was at
once a noble and hellish not, pun-
ishable not only by death but eternal
damnation.

Great Stakes

Now we may ho-hum at the wages
of sin and all that —- but Marlowe’s
Faustus could not. He played at a
game with tremendous stakes —
by Renaissance standards anyway-
and lost.

Performing “Dr. Faustus” to a
Twentieth Century audience, then,
would seem to raise some impor—
tant problems of communication.
For most of us (rightly or wrongly)
the struggle between God and Man
for control of Nature is a dead
issue. Also, Marlowe's play is shot
through with contemporary Eliza-
bethan references, which may have
some attraction as delightfully mys-
tifying mumbo-jumbo but mostly‘
obscures our understanding.

By not resorting to a “modern-
dress" interpretation (which if
played at Page Hall without a fun-
damental re-writiug of the conflict,
would have been a major disaster),
Director Burian flew in the face of
the Twentieth Century and gave us
an iniepreiution which, in its very
remoteness, struck with consider-
able powel'.

itself, which is arranged in a string
of set-pieces — but the developing
relation of Faustus to Mephisto-
philis never quite came alive. Also
- a minor point - Miller's ges-
tures were at times to mechanical
and distracting.
lronlcally Right

As for Mephistophilis, I had ex-
pectdd a more urbane and witty
devil than Daniel Labeille's sur-
prising and effective portrayal of
a soft-spoken, grim -— and almost
pious - fallen angel. in fact, for
someone coming in late it may
have looked as though Fausius (with
his pride and lust for conquest)
were the Devil, which, in terms of
the performance, turned out to be
superbly nnd ironically right.

The whole supporting cast did 'a ,
magnificent job of stepping in and ‘
out of multiple roles, and, above:
all, making themselves at ease with'
difficult lines. The voices (par-
ticularly that of Lester.Greenberg'
as the Chorus) were appropriately
in character — though Lucifer might
have spoken with a bit more auth-
ority and dignity.

Inspired Setting
The Cathedral itself, quite apart
from any thematic relevance, was
an inspired setting. It provided just
