WAA Team Ends
Hockey Season

The girls’ hockey team journeyed
.to Oneonta on Oct. 31, in their sec-
iond game of the season. The forward
line produced three goals — two by
,Dottie Mancussi, one by Karen Hor-
rwitz. Oneonta was not to be outdone
and in a seesaw battle in which the
score changed hands six times,
Oneopta tied eta-3.

The hockey team ventured north-
ward to Skidmore on Nov. 7, in
their final game. Both teams played
exceptionally well but the Skidmore
goalie proved to be the difference;
and on two occasions she alone
blocked sure goals. Ginny Beattie,
Albany’s goalie, did a fine job and
blocked several shots at point blank
range. However, the Skldmore team
was too fast for Albany and Skid-
more won 3-0,

Coach Keith Munsey and
the five men selected to

yesterday afternoon from
Albany County Airport.
From there they ﬂew to
Kennedy International Air-
where they were
whisked by jet to Chicago.

The five barriers are Tom Rob-

John Clark, and Ken Dormer. Coach
Munsey and the team are optimistic
over the team’s chances to improve
on last year’s showing at Wheaton.

Team Improved

In the 1963 meet State’s failure
to finish higher than fourteenth was
due to the lack of team depth. The
first three men to finish for State,
Robinson, Tuttle, and Clark, will
all be returning to Wheaton.

girl's field hockey team and their”
coach have been attending prac-
tices of the Mohawk Field Hockey
Association. Last Sunday tryouts
were held for the formation of the
teams to participate in the North-
eastern Field Hockey Sectionals.
The sectionals will be held at Vas-
snr this weekend. Demetria Bene-
ares, a freshman, will start at right
halfback; Sue Emborsky and Miss
DeLamater will be substitutes.

   

Looking back at the recently completed AMIA foot-
ball season, we feel that several comments are in
order. Although Potter Club walked away with its
tenth straight championship, the league’s overall
strength was decidedlyimproved as compared with the
past few years. For the first time in several years
a playoff for the championship was necessary.

Potter placed seven men out of nine on the All-Star
team offense. We agree with virtually all the All-
Star selections, which were decided by a poll of the
team captains. However, certain men, in our opinion,
rate special mention for their outstanding perform-

811065.

The league's most valuable" player has to be Potter
quarterback Wayne Smith. “Smitty” passed, ran, an
punted with equal excellence to provide the impetus
for the Club’s powerful scoring punch. The lone defeat
that Potter suffered came when Potter played without

the services of Smith.

APA’s Jack Buchalter was the outstanding defensive
lineman. Buchaltcr consistently broke through the
opposition’s blocking to nab the quarterback or ball
carrier for a loss of yardage. KB's Lance Anderson
also deserves praise for his fierce line play.

All-Star ends Dick Crossett and Denny Phillips
were key men for SLS and Potter respectively. Mike
Schwartz, who also did a fine job as league com-
missioner. Gary Moore, and Dave Catone comprised
Potter’s “beef-trust" — the offensive line whichpro-
vided tremendous protection for quarterback Smith.

There are many other men who might have been
included in this column. However. we felt that those
individuals mentioned above deserve recognition be—

yond their being selected to the All-Star team.

skill, and Darmer were valuable
additions to the varsity this year.

Coach Munsey feels that with the
improvement of Robinson, Tuttle,
and Clark, and the added strength
provided by Flick and Dormer, the
barriers have an excellent chance
to finish in the top ten tomorrow.

Kansas State Favored

The leading contender for first
place honors will be defending cham-
pion Kansas State. John Camion,
Kansas State’s sub-four minute
miter, who placed first last year
is heavily favored to capture indi-
vidual honors again.

In reference to Albany’s Robin-
son, Munsey said, “On any given
day Tom could finish in the top
ten." If Robinson can place in the
top fifteen, he will qualify for the
NCAA University Division Cham-
pionships held in late November at
Easr Lansing, Michigan.

The Feds will leave Chicago on
a neon night Sunday. They will be
arriving at Albany County Airport
at 6:30 Sunday evening.

First Round Over
In UCA_ Tourney

The first week of the University
Center Association’s annual tour-
nament has ended with John Mure-

.ness leading in billiards and Tom

Slocum ahead in table tennis.

The winners of the six-week tour-
nament receive a free trip to the
state-wide intercollegiate cham-
pionships which will be held at the
State University of New York at
Buffalo in late January.

The UCA tourney is divided into
six distinct rounds; the winner of
each round receives four points
and the second man gets three
points. At the end of the six-week
period the individuals who have
amassed the greatest total of points
in each category are declared the
winners.

Slocum ‘and Gordie Hutchlns are
presently leading in men’s table
tennis doubles.

Campus Chest, the annual Charity Drive at State.
is gradually drawing its activities to a close. Backed
by the theme “Carry a Torch,” the drive included
week-long booster sales, Miss Campus Chest elec-

tions ,

Chinese Auctions in the Student Union and

Husted Cafeteria, an informal dance, and a College
Bow] featuring Greeks and Independents.

Much of this year’s cam-
pus Chest was based on
events held in past years.
The drive stands as the
one major fund-raising
project of the university
community for the year.

Campus Chest chairmen Marion
Kintisch and John Gleason have an-
nounced that the annual charitydrive
will be extended through tomorrow.

The extension has been found
necessary because the anticipated
goal of $3,000 is not being reached
at a reasonable pace.

Sigma Phi Sigma‘s entry for Miss
Campus Chest, Marcia Daerin,won
the election which was held in the
lower peristyles Tuesday through
Friday. The winner was determined
on the basis of how much money she
received by the students who voted.
The election was very successful in
raising money.

The Campus Chest dance held
Saturday in Brubacher Dining Room
also fulfilled itsmoney-makingpur-
pose. Students paid fifty cents ad-
mission and women were able to

 

obtain thirty minute late slips at
thirty cents apiece. The two hun-
dred people that attended the dance
were entertained by the "Invaders"
a newly-formed band from Water-.
bury Hall.

Chinese Auction Successful

‘ The Chinese Auction was one of

the most popular events of Campus

Chest Week and raised about sev-

enty-five dollars. The auctions were

held every night in the Student Union

from 9-10 p.m. and in the Husted.
cafeteria. Merchants and students

contributed the goods and services.
that were auctioned off.

The final event was the College
Bowl held Sunday night in Bru-
bacher lower lounge. Approximately
two hundred people paid a twenty-
flve cent admission to see two
teams match wits.

The team comprised of Ginger
Dupell, Maria Maniaci, Pat Potter,
Carolyn Schmoll, Al Delflni, Stu
Horn, Joe Kestner and Chuck Mo-
den won $2.50 gift certificates from
the Bookstore for their 370-345
victory over Fran Greenfield, Barb
Townsend, Laurie Meyer, Mary Ma-
quire, Joe Cambridge, John Deans,
Bob Judd and Gene Tobey.

Mr. Ralph Grimaldl served as
moderator for the contest. The ques-
tions used were contributed by fac-
ulty members and were picked at
random.

Faculty Contributes
Faculty members have also been
able to contribute to the fund-rais-
ing drive. Thus far, they have been
contributing slowly but those con-
tributions received were generous.

Students, who have not contri-
buted yet, can still buy boosters
which will be sold in the lower
peristyles today and tomorrow.
