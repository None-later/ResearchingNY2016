 sir—SKANIA has ﬂown: that: it considers itself
entitled to the ridlt of making 'in-decision which is
not based on precedent. "

The issue of the yearbook, whether it be "Torch"
or "Carillon," is the case in point. At last Wednes-
day’s Senate meetingrtwo referrals were read and
judged upon by MYSKANIA. The first, concerning
the absence of power of the S. A. President to elim-
inate funds of a publication by assuming power was
justifiably upheld by MYSKANIA- ' .

The second referral. however. evokes consterna-
tion. Nothing in the Student Association Constitution
concerns itself with the existence of anorganization
on a name basis only; 'Th'eyearbook. since its be-

 

 

 

ginnings.» existed-as ado factb organization.

We question the reasons for requiring the yearbook
to submit a bill to Senate for approval of their name
change before they can continue with publication.

Before MYSKANIA can enforce such a ruling, an
amendment should be made to the constitution. which
would require the affirmationof 3/4 of the student
body to the proposal.

Success Requires Ellen

Once again our traditional charity fund drive is
drawing to a close with tally sheets and last minute
attempts at reaching the original monetary goal.

Overall, the impression it -has left is two-fold.
On one hand it stands out as a noble and concerned
period in which the students and faculty of this uni-
versity community have merged to support three
chosen charity funds.

In contrast to this. we were disappointed in the
apparent loose organization that the week went through.
Possibly the numerous committees are bulky to
handle, but, in that case, more attempt at rapport
should be made by everyone involved.

Cone-Its Questions
Editing of Article-

To the Editors:

1n the November 10 issue of the
ASP you published an article en-
titled "Archeologist Discovers Lost
Cove" by David Childs. This letter is
not a reply to that article or to
David Childs. It is directed to you,‘
the editors.

The article stinks, but that for
now, is beside the point. lwill explain
why I think the articles stinks in
just a moment.

The ASP is the studentnewspaper
and should be a serious publication.
The writing should meet some stan-
dard of quality. As editors you are
failing miserably when you prim an
article such as the one mentioned
above in the form it was published.

As editors you should have read
the draft more closely before print-
ing it, you should have crossed out
numerous contradictions within the
article itself, you should have (all
'in conjunction with the author) have.
eliminated the numerous personal
insults Mr. Childs has bestowed on
many State students.

These are some contradictions
which can be noticed onaflrst read-
ing. Now here are some questions:
Why weren't these edited out? is
this the kind of sloppy material that
the student press is satisfied with
and will print?

Childs is guilty of poor critical
technique. A close examination of
the article will reveal thatitis little
more than a series of pointless de-
rogatory remarks and absurd gen-
.eralittes.

The fact that some of these re-
marks have been taken by many
students as personal insults and the
fact that Childs offers no explana-
tion for his attack makes me feel
that the article was not written in
the spirit of constructive criticism
or even as humorous mockery (there
is nothing funny about referring to
countless Albany State women as
“wench.")

The article has a tone of malt-
ciousnass that you, as editors,
should have recognized or antici-
Dated.

1 cannot believe that what mo-
tivated Childs to write the article
was genuine malevolence, but than
are some students who might not be
as understanding as l. 7

ago... some examples. Any of the
following remarks could easily be
taken as personal Insults by certain

students, myseli included. _

In the sixth paragraph Childs sug-
gests that “Suppression,” “Coun-
terpoint,” the thespians and WSUA
might be cliques, that is, groups of
people whose common bond.is a
common sinister purpose.

lt so happens that i am vaguely
associated with “Counterpoint” and
can testify that it’s intentions are
idealistic and optimistic to a point
of absurdity. One reason that these
remarks offend me so quickly is
that they simply aren’t true.

In the third paragraph Childs
implies that the Cave is not a re-
spectable place. Therefore, the
people who eat there are not re-
spectable. He describes people-who
take their coffee in the cave as not
being overly verile, as being men-
tally deranged, as beinr a little odd;

I should not have to comment on
the ridiculousness of each of these
generallzations.‘ In my opinion,
Childs' desperate attempt to be
clever has failed. In every case his-
wit has been obscured by his bad
taste.

You editors' should have been
tipped off that there was something
peculiar about the attitude taken in
this article by the fact that it was
almost invariably anti-intellectual.
Childs is constantly slighting an in-
terest in art of attempt by students
to talk seriously about serious
to

pics.

He implies that fraternity men'
are incapable of or, at least, not
interested in being serious. [have
attended several schools and have
many close friends who are mem.
bers of fraternities. These friends
can be just as serious as anyone

eh’l‘ehe frateriiity boys and the com-
muters are not a bunch of grinning
idiots as Childs (whether he is aware
of it or not) implies. Their minds
are not so sterile that all they can
omit is “stock language, greetings,
emotions."
; One last thing that you editors
have failed to notice is that Childs
makes incorrect statements con-
cerning topics he obviously knows
nothing about. In the eleventh psra-
graph he says: "if writing is not
discussed, srt may rise from the
blue clouds of smoke.”

it so happens that I am an am.
bitlous it not at all capable, writer.
To imply that writing is not an art
is to stretch my sense of humor a
little iam, , , .

I am sure that putting out a stu-
dent newspaper every week is not

‘m'u . y,»

 

Mill'bfs‘ not a toy, however, and

 

teria proved invaluable as fund raisers. This year
only one or two were held there. If Campus Chest
plans on extending its activities, ‘we hope they con-
sider the cafeteria for daily auctions.

To make anything successful takes more than just
concerted effort on the part of one group. Commit-
tees can be expanded to ad infinitum, but if there is
no response to their endeavors, their energy has been
wasted.

A charity drive with the scope of Campus Chest
relies on the student body for support. The basic idea
of a combined fund-raising project should be suffi—
cient to cause some stir on the student's part. This
year. for some reason, support was, and continues
to be, lacking for this worthwhile event.

Campus Chest stands as a chance for us to cause
a change in the lives of other college students. To
say that this end is worthy of support is beyond
question. We have a tendency to envison our aim as
ultimate service, ‘but seem to overlook the fact that
it must begin at a narrow level.

ter of New York University do-
iiverod the final lecture of the
Renaissance Symposium series last
Friday. His speech was entitled
"Michelangelo and the North."

Using a series of slides to com-
pare Mlcheelsngo's work with that
of srtieteﬁin both Northernand
Southernﬂilrppo, Dr. Eisler dem-
‘iratrsted the similarities between,

example, the iamous«"Piota"
at St. Peter's and statues which
Michaeisngolo had probably seen
in Venice and Bologna.

it. particularly made the point
that Michelango put a great deal
of emphasis on the pathos and feel;
ing in his works. This was an im-
portant aspect of the Gothic tra-
dition, but was almost completely
ignored in the- classical revival.

A second‘ work which Dr. Eisler
dealt with in some detail was a
statue of the Virgin Mary seated,
with the Christ child standing at
her knee. This pattern was common
to sculpture in the North, but was
quite unusual in the South.

l .

The bike is described as a blue
and white trimmed American Roll-
fast with a metal basket coupled to
the handlebars. The bike was chained
to a tree in front of the dorm,but the
thief cut through the chain.’l‘he time
of theft was set at pproximately 10

m.

The Albany Police were notified
of the incident and the victim gave
them a description of the stolen
article. Any useful information that
will aid in the return of the vehicle
should be turned into Sayles Hall.

All owners of bicycles are urged
to take precautionary measures to
insure safety from theft of their

both Mlchealngelo's work, and art
of the North are the "-Y’Vshepe
of the crucifixion, and the Annun-
ciation to Mary by an angel ap-
proaching from her back.

Dr. Eisler quoted Rodin as say-
ing, “ Michaelsngelo is the outgrowth
of all Gothic thought." Actually
Michaelmgelo worked in a variety
of styioa, said Eisler, but he re-
turned ofton to the Gothic tradition.

in the civil rights move-

Hall. Friday, NoVember 20,
at 1:25 p.m. at the invi-
tation of the University
Freedom Council. ,

Rustin has worked for the cause
of civil rights since 1941 when he
became Race Relations Secretary
of the Fellowship of Reconciliation.
He held this position until 1953.

Freedom Rider

.A participant in the first Free-
dom Ride in 1947, Rustin was ar-
rested in North Carolina and spent
30 days on a chain gang. His report
of this experience appeared in the
“New York Post" and prompted an
investigation which led to the aboli-
tion of the chain gang there.

In 1955 Rustin went to Montgomn
ery, Alabama, at the invitation of
Dr. Martin Luther King to assist
in the organization of the bus boy-
cott. The next year he drew up the
first plans for the founding of the
Southern Christian Leadership Con-
ference.
