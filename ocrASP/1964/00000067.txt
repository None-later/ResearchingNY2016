Tom Robinson, who in last year's
meet, was 28th was first for the
Paris as he placed 40th in twenty-one
minutes and thirty-four seconds
(21:34).

Coach Keith Munsey had hoped
Robinson would finish in the top
fifteen runners .but said he was
not disappointed with Robinson's
showing due to the virus which ahd
been hampering the Perl barrier for
the past two weeks. “Robinson
just did not have it," Munsey com-
mented.

Dennis Tuttle, who had consis-
tently finished the number two man
for Albany this year, was 59th. He
had a 21:54 time, two seconds off
his pace from last year. Bob Flick

He termed John Clark’s per-
formance very disappointing. Clark
_finished 75th last year but this time
was only able to take the 106th
position with a 22:43 clocking. Ken
Darmer ended the Fed’s scoring
when he crossed the line in 23:52
to capture 149th position. Munsey
thought that Darmer’s performance
was effected by nervousness.

The team compiled 319 points,
12 points better than last year’s
showing. Over 200 runners ente’red
this meet, which was run on the
4.2 mile Chicago Golf Club Course.

Munsey was optimistic before the

seventy to eighty points from last
year's total. “With slightly better
performance on each man's part,"
he said, “we could have finished
6th or 7th."

Monkato State Teachers College,
from Minnesota, which finished in a
tie for; fourteenth with State last
year, moved up to fifth this time.

"This was the worst race they
ran all year and was very disap-
pointing," Munsey said. He added,
“our poor showing could hurt us
in the future if we ask for appro-
priations to go to another national
meet."

Veterans Next Year

The cross-country team has not
lost a dual meet in two years. How-
.ever, with the graduation of Tom
Robinson and Dennis Tuttle who ran
in the number one and two positions
the past two years, Coach Keith
Munsey expects next year to be
the team’s roughest.

Juniors Bob Flick, John Clark
and Sophomore Ken Darmer, who
were the number three, four, and
five men respectively, along with
frosh standouts Joe Keating and
Grant Downs, appear to be the
probable first five for next year's
crossvcountry squad.

Coach Munsey also expects the
other returning members from this
year's team to bolster the har-
rier's chances. These men are Jake
Johnville, Paul Russo, Bob Novak,
and Ed Brown. The coach noted
that Russo, in particular, has great
potential.

“Paul came out for the team in
mid-season but, even with this
handicap, he was able to produce
some very good times," Munsey
said.

CIVIL RIGHTS DEMONSTRATORS gather on the steps of the

 

State Capitol Building singing freedom songs during a rally last
year. At upper left is Bayard Rustin, active Rights leader, who

will be speaking here today.

Rustin to Speak Today

On Future of

Bayard Rustin, called
jibe best civil rights or-
ganizer in the country,”
will speak today at 1:25
p.m. in Page Hall. Invited
by the University Freedom

Council, he will talk on
“The Future of Civil
Rights.”

The Freedom Council plans iouse
the topics which Rustin will discuss
as the basis for a panel discussmn
of the local and national civil rights
picture.

Rustin's organizing abilities have
been much in evidence in the twen-
ty-three years he has Worked for

ivil rights. His most publicized
ﬂfort was the New York City sghool
boycott on February 3 of this year.

He coordinated the thousands of
marchers who picketcd 300 schools.
The boycott swelled pupil absence
figures by 360,000. It was staged to
protest the integration policies of
the New York City school board.

Directs Thousands

Rustin was also Deputy Director
of the March on Washington of Aug-
ust 28‘, 1963 in which two hundred
thousand marchers came from all
over the country to demand immed-
iate civil rights legislation.

Rustin began his career in civil
rights in 1941 when he became a
youth organizer for A. Philip Ran-
dolph's March on Washington. From
1941 to 1053 he served as Race lie-
aiions Secretary of the Fellowship
_..' Reconciliation. in 1953 he be-
cnrnc executive secretary of the
War llesistcr’s League, u pacifist
organization.

For seven years Rustin was it
special assistant to Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King. During this time he or-
ganized and coordinated nuniorous
marches, and drew up the first plan
for the Southern Christian Leader-
ship Conference.

Demonstrations Out of Don

While the bulk of Rustln's work

has been in organizing pi'otesidem-
onstratit‘, the passage of the civil
rights biﬂthis summer has greatly
reduced the activity and the em-
phasis in this area.
“In an interview printed in the
aepteinber iii, 1904 issue of “New
America” Rustin indicated that he
iecognized the need for anew em-v
phasis.

"Poverty exists amidst plenty,"
said Rustin, “and the Negroes are

hardest hit but millions of whites
suffer from the obstacles in our
political and economic structure to
effective remedies.

“It is in this context that we must
carry out the protest which is in—
volved in getting decent jobs,
schools, housing, and the right to
vote. We must, therefore, address
ourselves to the broader perspec-
tive of building and strengthening a
political movement in this country
to solve these problems.

"It is in this light that we must
consider the new phases and the
next steps for the struggle."

Workshop

 

To Discuss Government Structure

Student Government re-
vision will be developed in
large part tomorrow at the
all—day Government Revi—
sion Workshop in Brribachn
er Hall. Representatives of
campus groups will be tak-
ing an active part in the
reshaping of Student Asso-
ciation.

Last April, at the Student Gov-
ernment Conference, the essential
concepts and principls of a re—
structured government were de-
veloped. University expansion has
necessitated a need for adifferent
structure than that of the present
Senate.

Art Johnston, President of Sin-
dent Assooiation, explained that the
students and faculty concerned with
the revision since last April have
proceeded as far as possible with
the development of "the structural
implications" of the concepts and
principles "involved in such a fun-
damental reconstruction."

Ducentrulllutlon

The principles involved in the
workshop are aimed at decentrali-
zing the government as a whole, to
allow the individual student groups
to use their knowledge of the mech-
anics of their own fields in formu-
latlng a workable governmental pol-
icy

Johnston stressed the fact that a
Student Government should actually
be "student involvement in areas of
student concern at every level."

Appropriation

For "(A Weekend Expenses

by Steve Curtl

The passage of an amended Uni-
versity Center Association Emer-
gency Dill marked the Wednesday
niqu Senate meeting. The bill, as
was originally introduced by Sena-
tor Robert Gairie,- called for an
emergency appropriation of $1435.

This money was to cover the out-
standing bills from Homecoming
and the upcoming expenses for the
Holiday Sing. Senator Al Buder clar-
ified the bill when he explained that
$367 would go to the Holiday Sing
and the rest would cover the out-
standing debts.

Closer Communication

Senator Joe Daly said, “it is ob-
vious that this money must he paid,
but has anything been done to pre-
vent a similar occurrence?" To
this Senator Bader explained that
closer communication with Mr.
Richard Locker in the Business
Office has been set up.

Mr. Locker would not honor no
voucher unless signed by Senator
finder, President ofUniversity Celi-
tei' Association, or Cathy Miller,
the treasurer. The situation of hon-
oring vouchers without this proper
approval caused the debts.

Rotor to Committee

Senator Harry Gardner moved to
refer this bill to Finance Commit-
tee. President Johnston ruled this
out of order because according to
rules on emergency bill must be
voted upon. Senator Friedman
pointed out that by voting upon the
referral, Senate would be voting on
the emergency bill.

President Johnston retracted his

objection and entertained the Sena-
tor's motion. in discussion of this
motion Senator Tobey asked why
this bill was considered an emer-
gency.

Senator Bader replied that there
would be no Senate meeting next

Blake calls himself a modern

The Government Revision Project
has been in operation for three
years, beginning with the formation
of the Government Reorganization
Committee in Senate.

Students and Faculty Attend

Tomorrow's workshop will be at-
tended by student representatives
from various groups, and faculty
members who have been involved
with student government in the past.

Essentially, the idea of restruc-
ture centers around a Central Board,
which in turn is broken down into
commissions represented by all stu-
dent groups. These commissions
will include a Commission for Liv—
ing Area Affairs, Communications
Commission, Commission for Aca-
demic Affairs, and a Commission
for Community Programming.

bean Neil Brown will begin the
‘rogram with a speech covering
the background and the idea of stu-
‘dent government revision.

Fiom llllS general information

period, representatives will move
into discussion groups which will
also include faculty members. These
groups aim at accomplishing the
largest part of the workshop’s pur-

pose. They will be concerned with,

the scope of student government as
related to the organizations in-
volved.

Lunch Served

Lunch will be served to the dele-
gates at 12:30, after whichthe work-
shop will resurne with a general
meeting.

At this time a feedback and resume
of the morning’s work will be given,
and a question and answer period
will be included.

Johnston hopes that the workshop
will stimulate enough intrrestamong
the organization to provoke further
independent discussion.

Student government of the future
will be in large part formulated at
tomorrow’s meeting.

Because of the large number of
delegates, and the discussion-group
nature of the workshop, attendance
will be limited to the delegates.

ASP Enlist: Student Aid
To Sponsor Foster Child

by Linda Handelsman

For the second year the ASP is urging all univer—
sity students to contribute money towards the adop»
tion of a little Colombia girl, Graciela Garcia, through

the Foster Parents’

Plan. She has been the foster

child of SUNYA since January 1964, and $180 is
needed for the university to continue as her foster

parent.

The drive for donations
will begin before Thanks-
giving and will resume af—
ter the recess in an attempt
to have the money by

Christmas.

Letters have been sent to all the
residences, and collections will take
place in the Peristyles. Contribu-
tions may be given to any News
Board member or brought to the
Publications Office, Room 5, Bru-
hacher.

Poor LIvlng Conditions

Graciela Garcia lives in a two-
l'oom flat in North Bogota, Colom-
bia with her seven brothers and
her parents. Her father earns eight
dollars a week. Rent is fifteen
dollars a month, and coal costs
$2.00 a month.

lielore her adoption, Graciela
couldn't attend School because her
family locked the money needed for
clothing and supplies. Now she is
attending primary school in Colom-
bill.

In her monthly letters she tells
of the religious holidays she and
tier family celebrate. She is very
grateful for the eighty pesos she
receives monthly from her foster
parents. The money is used for
clothing and other family needs.

it any extra money is collected
it will be used for Christmas gifts
for Graciela and her faintly.

International Plan
The Foster Parents’ Plan, inc.
is an organization with international
headquarters in New York City.'l‘he
program. functioning in Greece,

Italy, llong Kong, Korea, the Philip-
pines, Viet Nam, Colombia, and
Ecuador, differs from the conven—
tional form of charity because it is
more direct and personal.

The foster children and parents
are not merely numbers. After the
foster parent chooses a child ac-
cording to age, sex, and nationality,
he receives a photograph and dense
history of the child.

Luttcrs Exchangsd
Each month the parent and child
exchange letters through PLAN
headquarters. Here the letters are
translated, but both the original and
the translation are sent iotheparent

and child. Gracieln‘s letters are»

published in the ASP.

'l‘he foster child receives $15 a
month to cover the cost of medical
care, household cquipment',couusel-
ling, and guidance. Clothing is sent
at regular intervals.
