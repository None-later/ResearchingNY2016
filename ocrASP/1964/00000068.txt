rub-a Refugee

Discussing 'the problems of the
refugee camps in the Middle East,
Dr. Matthew. Elbow of the Social
Studies Department spoke before
a crowd of about one hundred
people Wednesday night in Bru-

-bacher Lower Lounge. The pro-

gram, entitled “Shalom Means War:
An Arab view of the israeli Dis-
pute," was presented by Forum of
Politics.

Elbow spent two years in the
Middle East and was able to meet

. people who had been displaced by

the Arab-israeli dispute and forced
to live in refugee camps. He said
their attitude toward Israel was one
of great fear stemming from the

population explosion and the doc- ,

trlne of Zionism, which preaches
that Israel is the home for all
Jews in the world.

Slides of Houses
During the program he showed
slides of the mud and stone houses
where the people lived five in a

week; that the bills must be paid,

and the functioning of the Holiday

Sing would be threatened if the bill

were not passed. .

Motion Debotod
Senator Tobey, speaking against
the motion, said that the University
Center Association cannot spend
more than the outstanding bills, and
they need the money for the Sing.
He urged the Senators to vote against
referral to Finance Committee.
Senator Gardner then withdrew his
motion so that the bill might be
amended. Senator Friedman then
provided the amendment.

Bill Amended

The bill now reads to provide
$367 for the University Center As-
sociation; this money would finance
the Holiday Sing. This was finally
passed 28-0-2.

President Johnston announced the
resignation of Leda Simone, Senate
Secretary, and appointed Donna Gi-
lard as Acting Secretary.

Senator Tobey moved passage of
the constitution of "Counterpoint."
After brief discussion the constitu-
tion was passed 24-1-5.

room. They are fed and educated
by the United Nations Relief and
Works Administration who parcel
out the food by rations of only the
basic foodstuffs. Children, Elbow
said, got supplementary rations be-
cause most of them are suffering
from mal-nutrltion.

Schools have been built by the
U. N. to, teach a trade to those
people who attend. The problem
these people face is that when they
get out of school they have no jobs
waiting for them. Only about twenty-
five hundred are able to attend these
schools at one time.

People Have No Futuro‘

Elbow said he found that the rest
of the people, who number over a
hundred thousand, had nothing todo.
The Egyptian government has tried
to organize them into a military
unit to reconquer Israel.

Elbow pointed out that if nothing
is done about this situation, it will
lead to a bloody war. He said the
U. N. has tried to use this vast
supply of labor to build factories
and other facilities, but because of
the indifference on the part of the
Arab governments, this has been
virtually impossible.

Elbow called the tragedy of these
million people “not the suffering
from no food, because the U. N
feeds them; not the suffering from
lack of education because the U.N.
educates them; the tragedy is the
people are suffering from lack of
future of anything to do.”

"Chuck's a swinger." says she. "His

426 cubic inch mill that will mock your
turtle at the strip or on the street. He's
got fooronthe-lloor, buckets, balls,
carpets, console. spinners. and a padded
dash. And he said that everything bul
the four-speed slick and the 426
