Two days from now will mark a full year from the
date of the assassination of President John F. Ken-
nedy. Much has happened in that one year.

Even in the shock of one President’s death the
American people turned to the new President, and
under his forward-moving leadership put into law
the fundamental principle of the nation.

Less than a month ago the people re-elected that
President as President in his own right. In doing so
they rejected a man and a philosophy which attracted
support based on fear, prejudice, and a narrow con-
cept of social responsibility. I

The Warren Commission has issued its report
naming Lee Harvey Oswald unquestionably as Mr.
Kennedy’s assassin. The evidence is all there, but
the answer to the question Why? remains unanswered.
and will forever.

The year began with a violence and senselessness
which shocked the world. Violence has prevented us
from ever gaining any insight into that first act.
Violence and bitter hatred have eruptedin the struggle
for civil rights.

Yet the struggle for civil rights will ultimately and
finally be won in the legislatures and the courtrooms.
Reason and intelligence will continue to make the
changes that violence and blind emotion can not pre-
vent or erase.

As members of the university community we are
dedicated to this reason and intelligence. It has never
been more important than it is now for us to be aware
of the need for this dedication.

Although we often feel isolated in our own university
society and cut off from the rest of the world, we
cannot divorce ourselves from responsibility for the
world we live in.

We were made painfully aware last year. We must
continue to be aware.

Friday, November

The speeches today of Bayard Rustin and Peter-
Blake demonstrate the problem of inadequate sched-
uling procedures. Both men are speaking at 1:25 p.m.,
both are speaking on topics of social significance, and
both speeches are open to the whole University.

At the present time there is no “central clearing-
house" for scheduling speeches. When-Page Hall was
the only place available for speeches, it was easy

to make sure that there

were no conflicts. Now,

however, speeches are scheduled for Page, Draper
349, and Brubacher, all by different offices.

We realize that as the University gets bigger it. 0

will be necessary to schedule conﬂicting speeches,
and that audience size will not suffer as a result.
But the University is not that big yet. It is hard
enough to fill Draper 349, let alone Page Hall when
only one speech is scheduled.

We feel that either the Student Personnel Office
or the Student Activities Office should take sole
responsibility for scheduling speeches and other
events of interest to the entire University. In this
way the broadest schedule of programs will be avail—

able to the student.

Student Suggests Need For
Publicizing ‘Counterpoint'

To the Editors: ‘

Instead of ranting and raving like
Goldwater, Mr. Judd should devote
more of his time and energy to
publicizing “Counterpoint,” to ex-
plaining its functions and purposes,
its operations, how and where it
is distributed, etc.

Just because "Counterpoint" is
a product of Robert Judd neither
means it is desirable to have, her
of good quality. Mr. Judd will not
shame me into getting a copy by
calling me “fearful” which means
nothing, or “individualistic.” It is
not the duty of the student body to
support “Counterpoint,” but the duty
of “Counterpoint” to support, in-
terest, and stimulate the student
body.

He speaks of the apathy and the
aloofness, no, of the “hostility” of
the student body to his publication,
this is an indication of either of
two things, or perhaps both:

1) extreme cgotism, and/or

2) a persecution complex com--n

to a paranoic.

The student body, in asense,does
Robert Judd a favor when it reads
"Counterpoint," mainly because it
has neither knowledge of the type of
films he plans to make, or their
purpose, nor whether or not these
films will benefit the student body
as a whole.

Perhaps if these facts had been
made known first, or were made
known, we might be inclined not
only to support “Counterpoint” by
charity, but by submitting contri-
butlons as students do in the case
of "suppression."

indeed, the tone of Mr. Judd’s
statements makes me wonder
whether he is more interested in
performing services for.the student

State looms as University
h Programs and Activities

To the Editors:

For the relatively few people who
have chosen to recognize it. State
has proven this semester that. it
can be a “university” in a real
sense.

In the programs and activities
that have been presented by var-
ious groups on campus, we have
seen some of that “excellence”
we hear so much about, and see
so little of.

The first encouraging sign was
the Renaissance Symposium. This
series of six lectures maintained a
continuity throughout with the re-
suit that the students were given
a Renaissance “study in depth."

What was particularly commend-
able was the carry-over of Ren-
aissance study into other areas.
Many professors in various de-
partments required at least some
of the lectures and continued dis-
cussions in class.

As part of the program, displays
of Durer prints and Renaissance
'books were set up in Draper Hall.

The printing of “Counterpoint”
was another step forward. Unlike
some of the other publications on
campus, "Counterpoint" refrained
from petty digs of campus organi-
zations and personalities, kept the
tone of its writing high and has
chosen refreshing and intelligent
subjects for its interviews.

One of the most promising addi-
tions to the campus is the Golden
Eye, ll makeshift coffeehouse ill the
basement of the Madison Avenue
Presbyterian Church. Non-sectar-
ian, the group has filled the press-
ing need for nuinformal atmosphere
for faculty-student discussions.

Its last program included a lec-
ture and discussion led by fl Jesuit
priosi. lis next program will feature
faculty readings fl'omSayre’s "Doc-
tor Fuustus."

The most recent achiuvemeni on
campus WIIS the State University
’I‘hcntre produoiion of “Doctor
Fuusius" at All-Saints Cnihedl'nl.
Originally designed as part of the
Symposium, this unforgettable pre—
sentzltlon proved the real climax
of ihe program.

The cllolce of Marlowe‘s drama
was in keeping with the consistently
high quality of theatre that Dr.
Burlan's group has offered the uni-
vei'slty.

Particularly notable were the per-
‘fcrmances given by Howard Miller
.in his role of the egotistical Doctor
and Daniel Labellie as the brooding
devil Mepbisiopiliiis. The latter did
a surprising jobofsieallugilia show.

However, the excellence ofoppor.
iuniiy has not provoked an excel-
lence of response. With thoposaibie

ocepton of “ Fauatus" none ofthou

activities has received the recogni’ .

tion it deserves.

One gets the distinci impression
that had not the Renaissance lec-
tures received such strong support
from the faculty in and out of class,
the audience would have been sub-
stantially reduced. Further, rela-
tively few students took advantage
of the question and answer periods
that followed.

“Counterpoint” editor, Robert
Judd has lamented the lack of re-
sponse his publication has received.
(The one possible justification here
might, be that for some reason,
copies of “Counterpoint” are very
hard to find.)

On the other hand, there is no

lint Returns from Middle East;
Taught History in lebunon, Turkey

by Harold Lynne

“It is possible to teach American
history or European history without
having traveled to these areas; how-
ever, ill order to be qualified to leach
Middle Eastern history, I feel that
one must visit the Middle East,”
commented Dr. Matthew H. Elbow,
who has just recently returned to
State's faculty after two years in
the Middle East:

Dr. Elbow explained, "Every
country's problms are so differ-
ent. It is very difficult to generalize
about anything between nations or
even within any particular nation.”

In 1962-63, his sabbatical year,
he was a Visiting'professor of his-
tory at the Beirut College for Wo-
men ln Lebanon. He arranged for
this teaching position through‘ the
United States Presbyterian Church,
to which the Beirut College for Wo-
men is related.

‘ In March 1963, while teaching at
the College for‘Women, Dr. Elbow
was notified that he had been awarded
a Fullbright grant to teach at Robert
College in Istanbul, Turkey.'"l had
originally planned to return home af-

- fer my year in Beirut; when I found

that with the Fulbright I would be
abie'to stay in the Middle East for
another year, I was elated,” Dr.
Elbow said.

Reader Questions Taste

Of 'suppression' .Editors

To the Editors:

known as "suppression" has been
circulated ill the Husied peristyles.
The editors of "suppression" have
siaied their intention of cleaning up

can institutions. Stratiger enough,
these schools Are chartered under
the Board of Regents of the State of
New York. It was necessary for
these American schools abroad to
be accredited by some educational
organization in the United States,
and New York was chosen to handle
the matter.

At these Middle Eastern colleges
virtually all the courses are taught
in English. For those students who
do not have a background'in English,
these institutions have set up pre—
paratory schools which administer
an intensive English program.

considerable criticism .of these
American colleges for being cul-
turally imperialistlc. Yet, there is
also a tremendous demand to gain
admission into these schools.

Religious Toleratlon

To further discuss his experi-
ences in Lebanon and Turkey, Dr.
Elbow noted, it is necessary to
handle each country separately.

There is toleration of many di-
vergent religious sects. Each church
supports its own schools; thus has

Dr. Matthew H. Elbow is a
professor of history at Albany
State. He received his B.A.,
MA. and Ph.D. from Columbia
University. He has done post-
doctoral work at the Sorbonne
and at the Geneva Graduate
Institute of International At-
loivs. In l954, he received a

arisen a complex system ofprivaie,
church—affiliated schools.

Lebanese public schools are con-
sidered among the best public
schools in the Middle East. As a
result of its line educational possi-
bl ties, Lebanon has over fifty per
cent literacy. With the exception of
Israel, this is the highest literacy
rate in the Middle East.

“I was very lucky to have been
able to secure a teaching position
at the Beirut College for Women
because that is an ideal Lebanese
school for one who wishes to fa-
miliarize himself with the variety
of religions ill Lebanon," Dr. Elbow
said. _

The religious composition of the
Beirut College for Women clearly
reflects ills overall religious di-
visions of Lebanon. The college,
as is Lebanon, is half Moslem and
half Christian.

The major Moslem subdivisions
are the Sunniie, the Shiite, and tile
Druze. The main Christian sect is
the Maroulie. The Maronlte Church
is associated with the Roman Caill-
olic Church; however, there are
certain salient deviations fronl Ro—
man Catholic doctrine. Services are
held ill Arabicfprlests can marry;
and the Pope, although he is recog-
nizedgis not considered as impor-
tant as file national patriarch. The
other significant Christian group is
the Greek Orthodox Church.

Policy Criticnsms

“Dr. Elbow said, “In my yeal
at the Beirut College for Wonlelll
was often confronted with iwonlajor
criticisms of United States policy-
[on much foreign aid to Nasser’s
Egypt and endorsement and support
of Israel.”

The Lebanese Christians with
whom Dr. Elbow came ill contact
tried to impress most upon him, as
a visiting American, how great the
fear of a United Arab state was to
them. In Lebanon neither the Mos-
lems nor the Christians dominate
politics because their religious
population is fairly even ill num-
bar.

If a united Arabsiaie were formed,
the Christians in Lebanon would be-

come a small minority. This they
are certain, would result in severe
religious persecution. Since Nasser
would be the key figure in a united
Arab siaieﬁhe Maronlies are very
displeased with the United States
for giving Egypt so much foreign

Another sore point in American-
Lebanese relations revolves around
the partition of Palestine in 1948.
Lebanon violently opposed the Uni-
ted Natious’ proposals for the par-
tition of Palestine and the estab-
lishment of the state of Israel. The
United States supported the plan for
partition and was the first nation
to officially recognize Israel.

This was a severe diplomatic,
blow to Lebanon (and the other Arab
nations) for which the United States
has ilever been forgiven.

In Defense of the USA

At Robert Collge in Isianbul,Tur-
key, Dr. Elbow found himself in a
position where, as he stated, “not
only did I have to teach, but I also
had to defend the United States.“
His tenure at Robert College began
immediately after the summer of
1963, when the civil rights issue in
America had reached a fever pitch.

"My students were always asking
about racial Strife in America. The
Turkish newspapers played it up;
Negro demonstrations were front
page material," Dr. Elbow said.

ills students could not understand
how a single state, sucllas Mississi-
ppi or Alabama, could claim ihatthe
federal government did not have the
right to enforce civil rights legisla-
lion. “I tried to explain the federal
system to them - that states had
the prerogative to challenge the
constitutionality of the federal gov—
ernment’s actions,” Dr. Elbow said.

Turkey has never had very friend-
ly relations with Russia. Dr. Elbow'
was aware of this, but he had not
expected the degree of anti-com-
munist sentiment which be dis-
covered exisis in Turkey. "Turkey
is on the border of Russia and, wilell-
ever something goes wrong, the
people’s first reactionisillaiiimust
be a communist plot.

When President Kennedy was as-
sassinated, Dr. Elbow’s students
immediately assumed that behind
such a horrendous event only the
communists could be.

Widespread llllterucy
During Ills year ill Turkey he
found that one of the greatest prob—
lems facing the Turkish govern-
ment is that of introducing wide-
spread educational refol'nls. More

than sixty per cent at the popula-
tion is illiterate.

“Even though the government has
passed a compulsory education law
the problem is far from solved," Dr.
Elbow asserted. He explained that
the masses oppose education for
women and only desire technical
training for men.

Four—fifths of the populationlives
in small villages wilere the condi-
tions are very poor. Transportation
facilities in most of Turkey con—
sists of mud tracts. Modern com-
munication facilities in iilese areas
is almost non-existent.

Teachers Unwllling

Teachers willing to go to these
villages are hard to find. Those who
are able to obtain lligller education
are generally the children of gov-
ernment officials or the wealthier
city inhabitants. "Only the very
dedicated teach in these villages.
Most university students are accus-
tomed to a relatively high standard
of living, and they do not wish to
teach ill ills backward villages,”
Dr. Elbow said.

He added, “I tried very hard to
instill in my students at Robert the
patriotism which would make them
go out and teach or serve as eligi-
neers in the rural communities
where they are so desperately
needed. Turkey has tremendous pos-
sibilities if the educated elite could
be convmced to work in the under-
developed areas.”

During his two yenrslnille Middle
East Dr. Elbow, by utilizing vaca-
tions to good advantage, was able to
visit almost every Middle Eastern

country. He traveled to Egypt,Syria,
Jordan, Turkey, Iran, and Iraq. The
only places that he did not travel to
were the Arabian peninsula and
Israel.

Frightening Experience

The most frightening experience
in his travels occurred inihe spring
of 1963 in Jordanian Jerusalem. He
was staying at a convent situated
on the Via Dolorosa, a road over
which Christ supposedly walked on
the way to Calvary.

Dr. Elbow recounts, “We had
heard that there were some mobs
of teenagers attempting a revolt
against the government. Suddenly
our fears were confirmed by the
sighting of about fifty teenagers
approaching the convent. We looked
ourselves in for what turned out to
be two days of confiemeni.

“At one point the mob tried to
break into the convent, but we were
able to keep them from geitlngln.
Soon the government sent in troops
to protect the convent.

“We later discovered that the mob
had tried to break into the convent
because it was believed illaia couple
of their friends were being held
there. I don’t know what would have
happened if they had broken in.

“I can't say whether the people
ill the convent would have been
harmed; however, I'm sure that ir-
reparable damge would have been
done to the convent. Tile convent
was built over Roman ruins and it
contains many remnants which date
back to the life of Christ.

“Besides this one incident,lmust
say that wherever we traveled in
the Middle East, the people were
very hospitable. I thoroughly enjoyed
the two years, as did my whole
family, and I hope to return to the
Middle East in the near future."
