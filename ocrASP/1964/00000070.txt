As I sat in my study, meditating
upon the question, "is the employ-
ment of Negroes in advertising ele-
vating the status of the Negro, or is
,it, rattler, elevating the status of
'the advertiser, or both, or neither?”
1 was interrupted by an almost in-
audible knack at the door to my
apartment.

"Whoever that is certainly sounds
frightened, exhausted, and guilt-
ridden," I said.

"Who’s that knocking at my
door?” I said.

There was no answer.

I opened the door and saw a
pathetic figure huddled against the
wall and kneeling on my welcome
mat. It turned around and looked
up. It was Polarity Ochone, girl
freshman. I knew her slightly.

“You’re‘the only one I can turn
to, Tim," she said.

“Who says?" I asked.

l‘Trudy, Tim Trudy. Trudy the
bat-girl sent me. Help me, please.
Can I come in?” ’

It was almost suppertime.

“Can you cook?” I asked.

“Yes, yes. Why all these ques-
tions?” she was becoming hyster-
ical. “Please, i have to talk to
somebody, and Trudy says you're
the only one who can...”

I tried to cheer her up.

“I haven’t got anything defrosted.
and it wouldn't be right to send you
out for a pizza, but I think you can
make do with what's here. You
know. Fond."

Maybe she smiled at that, maybe
she didn’t.

“If I make supper, do you prom-
ise to listen to me and give me
good advice, Tim?"

“Yeah,” I said. And then I asked
myself, "Is she just using me?"
, “All right, I’ll fix something,"
she said.

I helped her up and into the apart-
ment. She rested on the couch for a
minute to cry and catch her breath
and then went into the kitchen. I put
on a few Benny Goodman Sextet
"78's and was moved to compose the
following:

Ode to Swing

My mind aches, and a thick depres-
sion bounds

My senses (mind you, I've not drunk
cheap wine this week as yet)when
I hear certain nee-sounds

'As executed by the eight or nine

And heave a heavy sigh.

Ornelte says, "Here lam and what's,
it mean?"

And Bonny "Here I am and oin'tl
great!"

“All you have is a can of bacon
fat and some mossy cauliﬂower and
eleven packs of Itegai Crown Sour
Cherry gum drops, Tim."

"Cove." 1 said. "Cope." It was
for her own good.

“But I can't think of anything to
make out of this stuff, Tim."

we were getting no place last.

“Look under the sink, you missed

something.”

“0h. Marshmallows.”

“Marshmallows,” 'I said.

“What are we going to do with
marshmallows?"

“That’s a gas stove, Polarity.”

No response. I was getting im-

patient.

“What’s the matter?" I said.
“Haven’t you ever had toasted
marshmallows for supper? What are
you, upper-upper or something?
h?”

We sat in the living room eating
toasted marshmallows. The Benny
Goodman records were over, andl
had run out of things to say. It was
very quiet. Polarity began to cry
again.

“Can we talk now?" she said.

"oh, alright. Tell me every-
thing."

“You promise to take notes?"
she said.

Again I wondered, "Is she just
using me?” But I consented.

"Everybody wants me to join
something. Everybody keeps pres-
suring me. 'Join. join,’ They got on
my back the minute Igot here. All
these clubs and organizations and
worthy causes. Everybody’s on my
back. I can’t take it. I can’t stand
it another...”

"Polarity, please don’t talk with
your mouth full."

“There's the WASPS, of course.
They’re every place. And the ARCS,
the American Roman Catholics,and,
wall, I felt so obligated that I joined
up with both groups. Then somebody
asked me to join the CHURCH, the

The recently concluded

Renaissance Symposium
was thefirst attempt of the
State University of New
York at Albany to present
to the students speakers
known in-various fields of
the arts and sciences, un-

der a broad theme
Dr. Edith Wallace was chairman
of the committee that worked to'

- bring these speakers to the Uni-

versity. She is mainly responsible
for the successful presentation of
the program.

Student Committee Aida
The Division of Humanities co-
ordinated the series of lectures and
exhibits with the aid of a committee
oi students. The symposium coin-
cided with the four hundredth anni-
versar of the birth oi Marlowe.

Huckleberry Road

"How about a gum drop, Polar-
ily?"

"No, no.”

"0h, c'mon. They’re individually
wrapped." -

She continued to talk and cry, and
really, I -could hardly blame her.
Or help her. I felt very inadequate,
indeed.

“I have no time to myself ” she
went on. “i have no time to study.
I flunked nine-tenths of my mid-
sems. But that’s not all. I’m doing
research for PROFOUND, the
Photogenic Rhodesians Operating.
Frantically On Uprooted Native Dia-
lects. If they’d only leave me alone.
And next semester they’ll be pres-
suring me to join the JOINERS, the
Jugglers of Inferior Niceties Ever
Resorting to Semi-smiles.”

“Polarity, do you want some
moss?"

She went right on.

“...Then let fall
Your horrible pleasure.

I stand, your slave,

A poor, inform weak, and despised
old man.

But yet I call you servile ministers

That have with two pernicious daugh-
ters joined

Your high-engendered battles

’gainst a head
So old and white as this. Oh, ohi

'Tis foul i"

“Polarity, We’re all out ofmarsh-
mallows, and you obviously need to
eat something else. Now. yon don’t
want peanut butter, moss, or gum
drops, and the only thing left is
bacon fat. Do you want me to heat
up some bacon fat?”

“Oh, I tell you, Tim, I'm in
trouble," (which, Ipresume stands
for Those Relatively Obelsant Un-
dergraduates Being Lackadalsically
Exploited) “with a capital T and
that rhymes with p and stands for
pooped.” (Which, lpresume stands
for Proceeding Overloaded and
Overheated Past the End to Death).

“What should I do, Tim?" she
asked.

"What do you want to do?" lsaid.

Here

Marlowe’s . Faustus” was
produced by the Department oi
Speech and Dramatic Artsin con-
junction with the Symposium. The
play has been deemed one of the
classics of the Renaissance.

“Cross Currents oi the Italian
Renaissance" was the topic of the
lecture by George Boas, professor
emeritus of Johns. Hopkins Univer-
sity, who inaugurated the series on

October 26. A recital and talk on-

music of the Renaissance followed.

Robert Conant, who is curator of
the collection of musical instru-
ments at Yale, giave this presenta-
tion, which was highlighted by a
harpsichord concert.

Theme shifted

From music, the theme shifted
to “The Intellectual Development
of the Renaissance." Professor of
Philosophy at Columbia, J. H. Ran-
dall, Jr. delivered this lecture.

The last- two talks dealt with
more typical considerations in Ren-
aissance studies — science and art.
Bernard Cohen of Harvard gave the

former presentation and Colin Eis-
ler, Professor of Art at the Insti-,

tute of Fine Arts at New York Uni-
versity considered "Michaelangelo
and the North."

Clifford Leech’s lecture on
"Shakespeare: Elizabethan and Ja-
cobean" was cancelled.

The library featured an exhibit
of Renaissance books from the col-
lections of the New York State Ll-
brary and the State University Ll-
brary while the Draper Gallery dis-
played a collection of Durer prints.

“We were interested in people

a Gama-Sided

seeing the relationships between the
arts and sciences” said Dr. Wallace
about the purpose ofthe Symposium.
She was pleased as a whole with the
presentation, saying that the ,pro-
gram brought different fields into a
general framework.

Question PerlodderuitluI

Wallace also felt that the questiot
periods which were held the day
after each lecture were very fruit-
on for those who attended.

“The students asked very pene-
trating questions," she said.

Students who served on the com-
mittee also praised the overallpre-
sentation. Milton G. Williams, who
is president of the Art Council, felt
that the symposium challenged the
students to remold many thoughts.

Williams commented: "I can see
no reason why symposiums onother
broad subjects can't beoffered to the
student body in the ensuing years.
This year’s Renaissance Symposium
illustrates what can be done with
good planning to broaden the intel-
lectual activities on this campus."

Robert Nottke, another student
member of the committee, spoke of
the speakers themselves. He said,
“Perhaps the major and most fre-

quent criticism is that the lectures.
were too difficult for the novice to'

understand. For some this may be
grounds for saying that a symposium
is of no value....

“Every effort should be made to
continue the symposium for the
benefit of the University community,
because exposure to oral intellect
is the sine qua non for the under-
standing of it.”

by Art Ferrari and Gary Spiolman

"The 'Moving Finger writes; and having writ,
Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit

~NOT ENOUGH COINS IN THE FOUNTAIN

Yes, wake up toolsl If editorials are to be written about needs,
they should include the whole picture. Not only lack of interest in
"University affairs," but apathy towards the needy. Dances, beer
parties, and dates - yet Campus Chest had to be extended to try to
raise more money. Hmm—the mind shudders.

IT’S A GREAT IDEA, BUT. . . . .

Yes, more fraternities are needed. But are the Beta Rho Sigma
boys in search of security or really interested in improving the fra-
ternltv system? It’s time to make sure, before it’s too late.

TOMORROW WILL TELL OR WILL THE STARS BE OUT?

After Senate's recent epidemic of acute quorumitis we wonder if
tomorrow’s worksho s will have enough people to plan a new student
government. Transit n equals interest plus new ideas. The new ideas
will be there. will the interest? Could be that fear of not havinga
future position has dimmed the interest of some of the "stars."

critical Commentary

'hloiaihooire’

. Al'. IANY'STUDENT m» “

 

by Alex Dollinl

Lionel Abel’s “Metatheatre” at-
temps to do two things. Firstto
demonstrate why it is difficult, if
not impossible, for modern writers
to produce tragic drama, and sec-
ond, to outline the basic elements
of a comparable form of drama

.which he calls “metatheatre.”

The following discussion will fo-
cus on the first aspect of Abel’s
book, that is, his theory of tragedy.

According to Abel, tragedy oc—
curs when the protagonist, attains
“daemonic” or divine stature as a
consequence of his sufferingthrough
punishment and destruction.

The tragic hero is a man who
has been destroyed because he has
transgressed beyond the bounds of
the human. As Abel explains, the
tragic protagonist has the audacity
(hubris) to act as if he were divine.

In doing so, he is ultimately
struck down by the powers he has
violated, but, paradoxically, these
same powers grant him at the close
of the drama the-very stature or
divinity that he originally claimed.

Oedipus Rex
Abel cites Oedipus Rex as an
example of such a “daemonic” fig-
ure. Oedipus is destroyed because
he has the audacity to believe that

he can avoid his fate and can un-
cover the truth about himself in
spite of the warnings of the prophet
of the gods.

Oedipus in effect acts as if he
were invulnerable, or divine.

Although Oedipus is struck down
at the end of the play, in Sophocles’
second part of the trilogy, “Oedi-
pus at Colonus,” the fallen king
has been granted divinity by the
gods, and two states are vying for
his sacred body when he dies.

Weak Explanation
Abel’s explanation of the tragic
vision is very weak. First, henever

’offers an adequate explanation of

the term “daemonic.” One may
question whether the tragic pro-
tagonist becomes "daemonic" pure-
ly in the'mlnds of the spectators,
'01‘ whether he performs some act
or makes certain statements which
necessarily reveal his divinity. '

From the example of Oedipus
given above, it would seem that the
latter interpretation is more cor-
rect, but Abel also applies the con-
cept of divinity to the character of
Macbeth, and this must inevitably
involve a somewhat different use
of the term.

There is also a glaring fallacy
in Abel’s use of Oedipus as an
example of the daemonic charac-

ARTS IN THE "ROUND

Shakespeare, Strauss, and label
Highlight latest Record Releases

by Jim Schraler, ACP

Summer 1964 saw two anniver-
saries: the birth of Shakespeare
and Richard Strauss; and the emer-
gence of a new record label still
causing much excitement.

Why read Shakespeare when all
the dramas can be heard in unique
performances? John Gieig'ud's
“Broadway Hamlet" transforms
Richard Burton into a flesh and
blood man who tries to face his
problem, meiiows slightly. then
plunges into an overly mature so-
lution.

The success is not Burton's alone.
The work of Linda Marsh (Ophelia),
Alfred Drake (Claudius),Hume Cro-
nyn (Polonlus), and Eileen Heriie
(Gertrude) complement the entire
production; a situation necessary to
let Burton's character take hold.

Shakespeare" Plays

England’s Decca (our London)fin-
ished the projected "Works of
Shakespeare" this summer. The
productions, most of which are
available in stereo, feature the Mar-
lowe Society players under George
Rylands.

"Midsummer Night’s Dream”
(OAS 1321 Stereo) is especially on-
joyable. The incidents, however un-
believable, do take hold in this per-
formance, while Thurston Dart's
musical direction makes this light
atmosphere live.

In contrast, “King Lear" (OSA
1414 Stereo) obtains its effect
through the simplicity of voice.
The characters weave and counter-
weave as tragedy effectively melts

 

 

 

 

from within the drama.

Strousl Centennial
Deutsche Grammophon spotlights
the Richard Strauss centennial with
a unique recording. Even the genius
of Con Hofmannsthal couldn't help
Strauss' lesser moments from which
“Arabella” springs.

However, the text inspired a few
of Strauss’ more encouraging pages
and the combination of Lisa Della
Casa (Arabella) and Fischer-Dies-
kau (Mandryka) makes it difficult
for one to forget this fact.

This recording is the actual per-
formance produced by Rudolf Hart—
mann and presented at the Munich
National Theatre. The effect of the
live performance is enhanced by
the record itself, thanks to DGG's
spotless surfaces.

New Label
Nonesuch records is anoii-spl‘lng
of the famous Electra label. Here,
for $2.50, mono or stereo, is avail-
able an uncommon library of lien—
alssancc, Baroque, and modernmu—
sic.

The chansons of Claude LeJune
were impossible to get on records
until now. But here 14 selections
are presented from this neglected
French master.

The vivid stereo depicts the mul-
tl-voiced polyphony with brilliance.

Nonesuch's recording of Bach's
flaming "Magnificat” speaks well
of itself, even at this low price.
The second side contains an excel-
lent performance by Teresa Stich-
Randall of Cantata Number 51.

English Evening

ter. He ciaims'that Oedipus' di-
vinity is recognized in the second
drama, l'Oedipus at Colbnus.” But
“Oedipus Rex” and Oedipus at C0-
lonus” are two distinct dramas
and should be evaluated individ-
ually, not collectively, if one is
looking for the basic elements that
constitute tragic drama.

We do not want to read “Oedi-
pus at Colonus” to recognize the
tragedy in “Oedipus Rex.” Nor is
there any direct implication at the
close of "Oedipus the fallen king
has become a divine figure.

Necessary Exclusions

The whole notion that the tragic
hero is a divine figure is rather
objectionable. It necessarily exq
cludes much that has traditionally
been considered tragic drama, e.g.,
Lear, Hamlet, Othello, and many
17th century French dramas.

The second objection to Abel's
theory is that he has overlooked
the possibility of tragedy being not
so much the destruction of a man
who seeks to transcend the human,
but rather, the struggle of a human
to achieve all that he can (consistent
with his own values) in a universe
that is essentially opposed to those
values.

Thus Oedipus seeks to avoid a
fate which he finds morally repug—
nant. He brings about his 'downfail
by pushing to the limits the dictates
of his conscience, a conscience that
demands that the truth be known re-
gardless of the consequences.

Thus, the tragic hero, rather than
Ilecomlng more than human, be-
comes as ideally human as possible.
His nobility lies in his affirmation
of the human, the demand for con-
sistency, in opposition to an alien
cosmological scheme.

Graphic Art

by M. Gilbert Williams

Though the 327 Gallery may not
have had much luck selling original
graphics, last Friday‘s sale spon-
sored by the Art Council showed
that there is considerable interest
in them at Albany State, even if this
is primarily at present heavily ex-
pressed by the faculty.

Reading “Counterpoint’s” (Vol.1,
no. 4) interview with Mrs. Nancy
Liddle, who helped found the now-
eclipsed 327 Caller: , was of great
interest. She noted a fact not all so
apparent to me as it became at last
Friday's successful sale. “People
just don’t understand print-mak-
ing," she said.

Indeed they don't. It may be ex-
pected that few people really know
the masters of the print, but i feel
it a gross shame that far too few
know the diverse forms of print-
making. Because 1 saw the lack of
understanding Mrs. Liddle has wit-
nessed, I felt the need to devote
this column to a series of defini-
tions concerning the graphic arts,
and that I would point out some of
the significant graphic artists who
are well worth studying and col-
lecung' Graphlc Am

Graphic arts refer to those print-
ing forms known as engraving.otch-
ing, lithography, serigraphy, and
block printing from wood and lino-
leum. Other allied arts are con-
nected with graphics and such minor
forms as the aquatint and the mezzo-
tlnt may be studied, but i shall only
try to define the major forms above.

Before 1 continue I wish to note
that an original print is a work of
art specifically executed to meet the
challenges printing holds for the
artist. A print is usually set to a
specific limited number, editions

varying depending upon 'the method
employed. More prints can be made
from a stone used in lithography
than from a wood-block used for
woodcuts. First-run prints will
usually bear the signature of the

artist and the number of the print.
lari ication

Now let us clarify some terms.

An etching is a print from ametal
plate intaglio (incised cut) design.
The plate is covered with an acid
resistant ink. A drawing is made on
the surface of the ink. Acid bites at
only the drawing, down into the plate
below, creating the incised cuts into
the plate.

A lithograph is made from plates
of either metal, wood, or stone. It
is an invention of the late eighteenth
century. The design is drawn on
the plate's surface with a special
ink which will resist the ensuing
acid bath. The acid slightly lowers
all areas but the drawing,producing
a raised surface as opposed to the
intagiio surface of the etching. The
raised area is covered withprinting
ink and ready to produce many imv
pressions. “New”,

A Serlgmph is produced by forc-
ing ink through a screen or series
of screens or by using a series of
silhouettes for which the ink is
sprayed over the cut-out form.
The woodcut is fashioned with a
hand tool into a wood block, leav-
ing only the surfaces which are to
be printed, raised. The linocut is
similarly produced. It is only the
block worked upon which varies;
one being solid wood, the other a
block of plywood, surfaced with
linoleum. Though leaving a raised
surface for printing is the common
method, an easier method exten-
sively used since Henri Matisse,
has been to carve out only the

drawing in lntaglio fashion.
Outstanding Printmalcors

Outstanding printmakers of the
nineteenth century include such ar-
tists as: Antoine-Louis Barye, H.
Daumier, Jean Millet. James M.
Whistler,and many other artists.

in the twentieth century impor-
tant print-makers include: E.Noide,
B. Buffet, H._ Ernl, P. Picasso,_
