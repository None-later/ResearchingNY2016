 

"We beve,l‘some reall fine individual wrestlers who can pull us throu the
season with a winning zecord. However. we are definitely golngtobe hin red
. by a lack of depth and experience." This is how wrestling coach Joe Garcia eval-
' ; uates his 1964-1965. matmen who open their season this Saturday in an ootagmal

- meet in Hiram, Ohio. Garcia is grateful for the return’of last year's Most‘Val-

uable Wrestler nnd co-captain this year.

5' Last' year the team

 ' placed fourth in the Hiram ,
 ‘Mee't. competing with such
squads as Ohio University

and the University of
Miami. Bill Thomas was
an individual winner last

year.

Thomas who won the Hiram 117
pound title is getting a strong bid
for the starting position from soph-
omore Ronald Smith. Both wrestlers
are outstanding and should make
State extremely strongin this weight
class. _

The 123 pound class belongs to
Monaco, who has lost but one match
in his two years of v‘arsity wrest-
ling. Last year he placed third in the
Hiram meet.

In the 130 pound division Howie
Miriam should be the best State
man. He could only wrestle the
eecond semester of last year be-
cause he was a transfer student.

Co-captain Robert Verrigini was
last year’s Most improved Wrestler

and is State’s best man at 137
_pounds.

The 147-pound class is open and
will be filled by lighter or heavier
wrestlers from other divisions.

Sophomore Paul Hoffman will
wrestle at l57-pounds, even though
he has had no high school exper-
lence.

Tom Koenlg, who will be out of
the Hiram meet to make up exams,
will be State's 167-pound grappler.

Outstanding Frosh Athlete of last
year, Dick Syzmanskl played bas-
ketball last season and has had no
wrestling experience at all. How-
ever, he wrestles well enough to be
Albany’s l7’7-pound man.

Heavyweights Chet Krom and Dick
Robelotto will share the division’s
wrestling cores for State.

The matmen face a very hard
schedule, including such schools
as Oswego, Brockport, and Cortland

Snowshoes”-

BMW! Stats Emit llavis Fund llrive

In. an attempt to aid researchers
to lind a cure for the dreaded dis-
ease that took the life of Ernie
Davis, Brockport State College
has organized an Ernie Davis Leu-
kemia Fund Drive.

Ernie Davis was a star football
player for Syracuse University and
was an All-American for two years.
He always wanted to play profes-
sional football, especially for the
same team that his idol, Jimmy
Brown, played for, the Cleveland
Browns.

He became the number one draft
choice of the Browns and signed a
contract to play for them. He died
before the season started.

Leukemia has snuffed out the life
of a young and gentle man before

he could fulfill his one life am-
bltion.

Until more answers are found
leukemia will continue to take the
lives of other young and ambitious
men such as Ernie Davis.

Already more than 40 schools
have 'signified their intention of
giving to the fund. Albany State is
one of those schools, and the list
is growing every day.

The Cleveland Browns have ear-
marked the drive with a $15,000
donation for the Fund.

Here is how you can help re-
searchers find fhe cure to the dis-
ease whose name '.5 a death sen-
tence. Send your donations to the
Ernie Davis Fund, American Can-
cer Seclety, Box 6800, Cleveland,
Ohio.

F rosh Hoopstcrs Have
Height, Injury Problems

by Jim Boiiin

Confronted with one of its toughest schedules in
years, and hampered by lack of height andpre—season
injuries, the freshman basketball team will rely upon
speed and ﬂexibility to garner victories. The 12-man
team, ranging in height from 5’8” to 6’3”, opens its
schedule on December 2 against Syracuse.

The first game should
prove the hardest one on
the frosh schedule. The
Syracuse starting team
ranges in heightfrom 6'10”
to 6’3”

Coach Bill Schieffelin said he will
depend upon the rebounding of Laurie
Peckam and Tom Carey, and the
shooting of Dennis Elkin and Larry
Marcus to sustain an offensive
threat. He plans to use a shuffle
offense, from which any man can
play the pivot position.

With seven or eight strong play—
ers, Mr. Schieffelln feels he will
have a strong bench to back up his
starting five.

SUNY Faces Financial Difficulties
According to Report of Trustees

Rises in tuition costs and room and board charges throughout the State Univer-
sity were foreseen by the University trustees in the State University's Master Plan
which they have submitted to Governor Rockefeller and the Board of Regents. The

report was sent to the Capitol on Noyember

“Times Union” revealed

The Master Plan calls
for greatly expanded facil-
ities to accommodate
184,500 students by 1974.
Present enrollment is
about half that. The expan-
sion includes plans for a
number of new two and
four year colleges, as well
as additions to existing in-
stitutions.

The trustees have appealed to the
State to assume “the full operation
costs of the dormitories, land ac-
quisition costs, and the large cost
of constructing one or more med-
ical centers."

in addition the trustees stated
that “the rising costs of dormitory
construction will require some ad—
}ustment in the room rent."

Rent increase PossibIo
Dean Neil Brown, asked about
the possible rise of room and board
costs at Albany, replied that be-
cause of the new campus, an in—
crease might be necessary. A $10
increase went into effect this year,

Help Gracelia

The fund drive for the ASP fos-
ter f'illiLl, Graciela Garcia, is still

' So far, we have managed to raise

about half the needed amoum, but
the support of the entire School is
necessary if we are to successfully
complete our drive by Christmas.
Graciela, a small girl of ten living
in the slums of Bogota Colombia,
S. A., will be the happy recipient of
Christmas gifts this year if the
ASP meets the quota. Please con-
tribute to Graciela's happiness in
the peristyles, your dorm, or the

20. The next day a story in the Albany

many of the State University’s financial difficulties.

although most of the resident stu-
dents are still not in the new cam—
pus facilities.

Dean Brown pointed out that on
the new campus, three meals would
probably be provided instead oftwo.
The private telephones in each suite
will also contribute to increased
costs to the students.

As for the possible rise in tuition
costs, Dean Brown speculated that
if tuition did rise, the State would
set up a broader program of finan-
cial assistance.

Tile "Times Union”article stated
that the "only alternative to addi-
tional state funds appeared to be
a slowdown in construction." Tile
present delays in Albany’s new cam-
pus construction, however, are not
related to the state'spurse—strings.
It is due rather to a problem of
labor shortage, especially of elec-
tricians. In September, electricians
had to be brought in from as far
as Nova Scolia.

Any increases in costs will de-
pend heavily on the state's willing-
ness to finance the University's ex—
pansion plans. The state is required
by law to pay half of the costs.

Plan includes Spociiics

President Samuel B. Gould sub-
mitted the Master Plan on behalf
of the trustees. The Plan is en-
titled "Stature and Excellence: Fo-
cus for the Future." It includes 89
specific proposals, aimed at pro—
viding the means of achieving iden-

ﬁx "is

my, hniiy. and excellence through-
out the University.

Albany figured in several ofthese
proposals which included establish-
ing a school of social welfare atAl-
bany (such a school now exists but
is now for the first time a part of
the Master Plan), establishing a
school of Criminal Justice at Al-
bany, expanding the Graduate School
of Public Affairs at Albany, and es-
tablishing a graduate school of li-
brary science at one of the univer-
sity centers.

The majority of the proposals,
academic in nature, reflect many
of Dr. Gould’s ideas such as he
discussed in the ASP on November
6. They are related to "the task of
coordinating and unifying a univer-
sity with 58 separate units."

TV and the Press

They include plans for improved
and enlarged library facilities, co—
operative educational programs
among units. and provisions to fa-
cilitate transfer of students between
the units.

More study and research grants
will be given, and preparations will
be made toward the establishment
of a University Press. A Univer-
sity—wide television network is also
in the plans.

Several new facilities have been
proposed including the construction
of two 4—year colleges of arts and
sciences, at medical center at Stony
Brook, and 2-year community col-
loges in five to six locations.

DR. RICHARD WiLKiE takes a break in his oiiice as he pro-

pares ior tonight's Golden Eye program, "Jim Crow in Perspec-
. ..

tive

Golden Eye to View Jim Crow

Tonight. the Golden Eye Coffee
House. sponsored by the Campus
Christian Council,will present “Jim
Crow in Perspective."

Featured in the program will be
Dr. Richard Wilkfc, Associate Pro-
fessor of Speech at State, and Mr.
James Lockhari, a member of the
New York State Commission on liu-
mun liigius and a graduate of Al-
buny State.

“Jim Crow in Perspective” is
similar to "In White America,"
the award-winning off-Broadway
play which traces Negro history in
the United States and which is cur-
rently beginning a national tour.

The program will include original
documentary, poetry, prose, and folk

songs. Professor \Vilkie is locally
well—known for his folk-singing and
is a member of the CORE singers.

The Golden Eye. in the few weeks
of its existence, has proven to be
very provocative and entertaining
in HS dlSL'LInSlUllS, concerts. and
readings, for example Dorothy Say-
er’s Faust play, “The Devil to
pay." .

The coffee house is located at
820 Madison Avenue (in the base-
ment of the Madison Avenue Pres-
byterian Church) and is open every
Friday evening from 9-12 pm.

9:30 pan. All students and faculty
are welcome. There is no admis-
sion charge.
