- The Revised Senate Election Bill
was 'the key piece of legislation
passed. by Senate on Wednesday
evening. After Senator Al Seder
moved.the passage of the bill, there
was brief discussion. ‘ ’

During the discussion it was
pointed out that a male Junior would
be eligible to run for Junior Prom
Queen. The Senators took this in
stride and passed the bill 26-4-0.
Senator Harry Gardner moved the
passage of the WSUA appropriation.
This bill would provide money for a
technical supervisor. This bill was
passed with no discussion 29-0-1.

Appropriations

Senator Robert Gable, chairman
of the Ways and Means committee,
reported on two bills. The first was
a University Center Association line
transfer oi $1072 from the Income
line to the University Concert line.

Also discussed was a transfer of
$1362 from the Income line to the
Special Events line of their budget.
The second request was for, an
appropriation for the University
Center Association. The appropria-
tion request was for $876 from the
Emergency Spending line oi Sen-
ate's budget.

This money would be used to pay
for the Homecoming Debts. Presi-
dent Arthur Johnston led a discus-
sion with the Senators. During this
time they discussed the advisability
of electing or appointing new Sena-
tors to im the vacancies in theSen-
for, Junior and Sophomore classes.

The Senators seemed to feel that
elections would take too long, and
there is not much time remaining

for this Senate. However, many of
them felt. that appointments would
be‘feasible.

Appointments ‘

If the President were to appoint,
he would have had to do it at this
session because of the passage of
the Revised Election Bill which does
not give the President of Student
Association the power of appoint-
ment. . ‘

Senate moved into closed session I

to discuss these replacements.
While in closed session, the Senators
also discussed the path of the gov-
ernment revision. President Johns-
ton commented on the closed ses-
sion.

He said, "The closed sessionwas
designed to provide Senators with
the opportunity to discuss the path
of Student Government during their
terms of office and the problems in-
herent in recognizing, for the first
time, instead of ignoring the fact,
that our present system innately
lacks any reality of representative
government or effective powers."

projects in many areas of research
and writing.

Assistant Professor Warder Cad-
bury is serving on the staff oi the
Adirondack State Museum. In con-
nection with this position Cadbury
collects rare books, works oi art,
and historical letters. lie is cur-
rently concerned with professional
writing associated with the museum.

At the same time, Cadbury is
completing a doctoral dissertation
on the subject of ethics as a degree
candidate at Yale University.

Analysis of Religion

Assistant Professor John Riser
was the author of an article. “Phil-
osophical Analysis of Religious
Statements" published in a recent
issue of “The Monist.” An article
by Dr. Riser in the field of logic
has been accepted by the "Journal
of Symbolic Logic.”

William V. Grimes, assistant pro-
fessor, is working on a book in the
field of ethical theory. He has also,
presented papers to several profes-
sional societies on the topic, "Deo-
ntic Logic, the Logic ‘of impera-
tives." .

Grimes has presented public lec-
tures concerning his travels in
Greenland and Panama. Some of his
publications relating to Panama are
still on the classified information
lists in Washington.

recently contributed an article on
the philosophy of Alfred North
Whitehead to "Philosophy and Phe-
nomenological Research.” He is
currently a member of the Infor-
mation Service Committee of the
American Philosophical Associa-
tion.

Robert Creegan, Professor of
Philosophy and chairman of the De-
partment of Philosophy, has been
a steady contributor to journals of
philosophy and related fields.

Most recently, his reviews have
appeared in “Philosophy and Phen-
omenological Research” in June
and September, 1964. Last year Dr.
Creegan had a report published in
“School and Society" on visit to
this campus by the French exis-
tentialist Gabriel Marcel.

A report on the 1964 Renaissance
Symposium, recently concluded at
State, is now under editorial con-
sideration.

Speech on Logic

In recent years, Dr. Creegan has
done some independent research
in mathematical logic. His topic for
a speech delivered at the December
3rd meeting of the Faculty Research
Society of Albany was “The Logic
of Logic.”

Last August, while at the Uni-
versity of London, Dr. Creegan
found materials to use toward the
completion of a book he is writing
on current philosophies.

An earlier book of Dr. Creegan’s,
now out of print, was entitled, "The
Shock of Existence: 8 Philosophy of
Freedom.”

Over one hundred schooladminis-
trators from schools belonging to
the Capital Area School Develop-
ment Association met at SUNYA on
December 1. The purpose of the
meeting was to discuss plans for
the entire State University, with the
emphasis on the University at A1-
bany.

The principal speakers were Dr.
Samuel B. Gould, president of the
State University, and Dr. Evan R.
Collins, president of the University
at Albany.

Dr. Gould stressed the impor-
tance of a sense of identity and
unity throughout the entire State
University. Because of the geo-
graphic disbursement of the fifty-
elgbt units of the University, no
one unit could become so enlarged
as to lose the intimate academic
environment.

Growth Meets Manpower Needs

The president said that the tre-
mendous need for educated man-
power will be met by the growth
of the University. He mentioned
some of the plans summarized in

the revision of the 1904 Master
Plan of the State University.

Dr. Collins discussed the change
found at the State University at AL-
bany. From a single purpose teacli
er-preparation institution it has
grown into a university center.

He pointed out that the University
has contacts with the rest of the
world in its many international pro-
grams and with its faculty traveling
abroad each year on study and re-
search grants.

Non-Teoching Study
There are presently more than
one thousand students enrolled in
the liberal arts or general pro-
grams. Teacher candidates ure also
given opportunities to study lnother
areas should they decide not to teach.

New procedures will help expa ?
the concepts of the university.
