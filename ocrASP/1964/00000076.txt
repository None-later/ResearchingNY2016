“9 Programming Agency

I The International Center ia‘pri-
mariiy a programming organiza-
.tion. Leaders, specialists in every
field, educators, and technicians -
all of these people turn to the Cen-
ter for guidance in planninga worth-
while itinerary.

Many of the people whom the
- Center aids are referrals from the
State Department and are here as
'guests of the United States Govern-
ment. Some of them are here on
grants and scholarships. All ofthese
visitors will return to their respec-
tive countries and inﬂuence the opin-
ion of their fellow countrymen in re-
gard to the U.S.

\ Resources Available
. .éThe Center has the task of ac-
quiring the biographical data on its
guests, and then to make avail.
able all of the resources vdthin a
40 mile radius which would be of
interest to the guest.

‘Appointments are made by the
Center for its visitors and trans-
portation is provided to the point
of interest. In some cases the guests
stay at the International Center, but
due to a serious space shortage,
most of them must be referred to
hotels.

The Center sends a report ofeach
guest’s stay to theState Department.
Problems which are encountered
can be ironed out swiftly if other
groups are aware of them and are
prepared to cope with them in ad-
vance. It makes the guest's stay
more pleasant if his problems are
alleviated as soon as possible.

VI National Affiliation

‘ Organizations such as the Inter-
national Center are forming all
over the country. They stem from
a"concern by individuals in a com-
’niunity for foreigners not benefltting
'fr‘om all the area and its citizens
-’hrive to offer.

existing.

The National Council for Com-
munity Services to international
Viiitoi-s (cosaav) is the national
affiliation for the agencies across
the country which save the govern-
ment so much time and expense.

it is estimated that these groups
save the State Department about
$10 million in free programming
per y_ear. Albany's citizens feel, as
those in so many other American
communities do, that the expense
is nothing in comparison to the wide
services rendered by International
Centers across the U. S.

Other Services

The International Center attempts
to make Albany’s guests from for-
eign nations as comfortable as pos-
sible. Since they are often following
a rigorous schedule while in our
country, the Center punctuates their
visit in the tri-city area with a
dinner invitation from a local fam-
ily, relaxation at the Center itself
with its Friday night Open House
programs, and association with stu-
dents and doctors from all parts of
the world and local residents.

This informal atmosphere pro-
vides an opportunity to slowthe pace
and meet people of other cultures on
a casual social level.

Those having slides, pictures,
national costumes, and who are will-
ing to speak are encouraged to do 50.

'Rooms for lectures, discussions,
and group meetings are available for
use. French, German, and Spanish
clubs operate all year round. Anyone
speaking any of these languages with
moderate fluency is invited to par-
tlcipate.

Trips are organized to places of
interest with a minimum of cost and
a maximum of enjoyment.

Summer doesn’t bring a slowing
down of activities. Trips to Jacob's
Pillow and Williams College are
available to anyone desiring to go.

Nonprollt Organization

The international Center exists
through the generosity of the people
in the community. Its expenses are
met partially by the rental ofasmull
number of rooms to foreign guests.
An International Ball held in the
Spring also adds to the treasury.

This year for the first time the
Center co-sponsored with the Al-
bany League of Arts, Tyrone Guth-
rie's "H.M.S. Pinafore,"performed
by the Stratford Festival Company
from Ontario, Canada. The success
of the performance will determine
whether another such cultural pro-

duction will be sponsored by the

The government in no way sup-
ports the Center. It is grateful for
the services performed by the group
and to the community members who
make the existence of such aCenter
possible. Volunteers redecorated
the 100 year old building which acts
as the Center's home.

Employees

There are only two full time paid
employees: an Executive Director,
Miss Julia M. Graham, and anoffice
secretary. At the beginning of each
year they write to all the doctors and

Center Problems

Space is the biggest problem the
Center must cope with. On an aver-
age Friday night over 100 people
flock to the Center for its Open
House. The Center would like to
accommodate more, but it is vir-
tually impossible.

Rooms available for rental to
foreign guests are at a minimum
and the Center would like especially
to acquire more housing space so
that visitors wouldn't have to stay
in hotels. It would also aid the Center
in increasing its own finances.

The tri-city area receives a dis-
porportionate amount of foreign
visitors. This is due to the facilities
offered in the fields of medicine,
education, and government. All of
these are possible points ofinterest
to a visitor.

Making available itineraries,
transportation, and living facilities
becomes an enormous task. The
volunteers and employees deserve
much more than a pat on the back
for the excellent job they’re doing.

Reward

Their reward comes in the form
of a letter from a guest which reads
“Courtesy and a distant klndnessi
meet wherever I go in your coun-
try, l)ui the sweet hospitality and
delicate homeliness that I received
at your Center are unique. There
is an air of easy friendliness and a
genuine expression of warmth and
personal concerr for every new-
comer...the Center is a haven of
comfort and strength.”

HTS 11’ Art

I D 

68 Chapel Street was my destina-
tion. I told the cabby I was going to
the Galleria Miniature, but that
meant littlerto-hfm, and since it
was my first trip to thegallery I
couldn't describe the place exoept
for the gallery’s address. We passed
the Schine-Ten Eyck, and the driver
said I should soon be able to see
the gallery. Well, I didn’t exactly
see it, but I told him to let me out
and that I would walk a little.

I soon found the Galleria Minia-
ture, and it is aptly named. The
gallery is below street level and
is frightfuliy tiny. But it is attrac-
tive, and if you can see it as I did
when only two people were browsing
you’ll have a most pleasant time.

Currently on view, and hence the
reason for my trek, are recent
oils by Edward Cowley, Matt Lo
Russo, and Eugene Winters. In ad-
dition to the paintings are some
decorative plates by Mr. Winters.
The exhibit is on display until De-
cember 12, and can be viewed Tues-
day through Saturday from 11 a.m.
to 3 p.m. And if you plan on making
first acquaintances with the Gal-
lerie Miniature through the current
offering, you will find a selection
of works by three quite distinctive
and attractive talents.

Personal Statement

There is no doubt that the three
painters exhibiting are men who
have found a style of personal state-
ment which each can handle with
effectiveness and assurance. The
paintings of each artist show that
he has found a workable, and yet
personal, range of color. The crafts-
manship shows each artist can ably
handle his subject matter. Yet there
is one disturbing factor of the show,
which is an inevitable factor since
the works are all recent. The paint-

;Galleria(Miniature Trio Reveals 

Personal Statements

ings of each artist, though distinc-
tive from each other, taken painter
by painter give an evenness of at-
mosphere, of quality, and of ii-
nesse which takes some of" the
excitement away from the genu-
inely good quality of the paintings.

Let me clarify this by going
into some detail with each artist.

First let me take Edward Cow-
ley. His paintings of houses, of
store fronts, and of "The Busi-
ness World,”are, like the other
works, devoid of the human figure.
Cowley’s works in icy blues, soft
purples, or shining whites, with
small specks of brighter colorslike
yellow and red, are somberin mood.
His “Main Street House” is a turn—
of-the-century small town frame
building, partially covered with
snow. Like his other works, they
have sharply defined shadows which
remind the viewer of the excellent
paintings of Edward Hopper.

Whimsical Critic

Cowley’s designs are well con-
ceived, and somewhat whimsically
executed. He is partially social
critic with his "The Business
World,” where we see the ugly con-
fusion advertising signs are making
of the American landscape. But if
you haven’t had Mr. Cowley for
Art 3, you’ll never really under-
stand "Before Huckleberry Finn."
Unfortunately this painting is an in-
stance where the artist is too per-
sonal for his public.

Secondly I come to Matt LoRusso.
His is more realistic thanMr.Cow-
ley, in the sense that his brush
strokes are tightly drawn. Hisland-
scapes show a warmth for nature.
The paintings are done in bright
greens, autumnal hues of yellow,
orange, and brown. Skies are bril-
liantly blue. Works like “Country
Church" in winter show snowiighted
by the yellow beams of light pouring

Modern Dancer
To Demonstrate
Elements of Art

Pauline Koner, considered one of
the most important American mod-
ern dancers of all time, will appear
at Linton High School, Schenectady,
Saturday, December 5, at 8:30 pm.
Miss Koner's appearance is spon»
sored by the Capital Area Modern
Dance Council.

Her program, entitled “The Art
vi Performing," will explore the
basic elements that make a per-
formance a work of art. Miss Koner
will conclude with the dancing of
"The Farewell."

“The Farewell" is based on Gus-
tavo Mahler's famous composition,
"Das Lied von der Erde" (Song of
the Earth). Miss Koner has received
world—wide acclaim for her adapta-
tion of "The Farewell."

Miss Koner has recently been
awarded a Fulbright-Hays teaching
:rant in theatre arts and she will
ht departing for Japan in January.

Tickets for the December 5 perv
rormance are priced at $1.50 for
students, and can be obtained from
Miss JoAnne Baker in the Page
Hall Gym office. Miss Baker's of-
fice hours are Monday, Tuesda),
Wednesday, Thursday at 1:30-2:30;
monday and Wednesday at 3:30; and
Wednesday and Friday at ll:lﬁ-l:30.
There will he a bus at no extra
charge to trau'sporl students to the
Unhenectady performance. Those
who purchase tickets front Miss
Baker are eligible for this free
transportation.

from the windows. Lo Russo is a
naturalist with a somewhat broad
impressionist brush stroke. His
paintings in subject matter are akin
to both Childe Hassam and Luigi
Lucionfhboth painters of rural
America. In Russo manages suc-
cessfully to remain independent of
these artists in execution.
Abstract Slum

Lastly we have Eugene Winters.
His abstracted "Tenements" is his
best painting on display. It is a row
of city dwellings, set against ableak,
barren background. The latex rive-
lets which are mixed with the oils
create a dynamic excitement. The
dull green, earthen brown, ceramic-
like-tone of the work uniquely por-
trays the humbieness of the struc-
tures.

Yet for all of the excellence which
is on display, one Cowley varies
little from another, and the same is
true of the other paintings. The
works have, for each artist. a sty-
listic unity. This explains why the
first examples of each artist are
exciting, but a plateau of interest
is soon reached for each artist.

Strolling through the "Ancient
World” exhibit in the Albany Insti-
tute of History and Art basement,
it is easy to forget that the objects
are historical at all.

The jewelry, the water vases,
easily could be contemporary dec-
orators' items. A bronze bracelet
with tiny ducks might well make
Tiffany’s envious. Then you notice
the label: Persian, 000-700, B.C.

All summer, workers lowered
ceilings, installed cases and set
about labeling the exhibit, which
officially opened in September. Most
of the collection is on loan from the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, com-
piled under a six thousand dollar
grant from the New York State
Council on the Arts.

THE MARBLE HEAD at a we-
man dates trom the third century
B.C. It is probably a Roman
copy at a Greek work.

And how, women who think scarab
jewelry is the latest thing can learn
otherwise when they seea fist-sized
scarab, turquoise in color, bearing
the cartouche (the name written in
hieroglyphics) of Pharoah Ramses
II. The date: 1350-1085 B.C.

And for those who think linen
sheets are a modern luxury, the
Egyptians knew a thing or two about
that, too. A linen sheet — from
1580-1350 B.C. -— is on display with
a notation that only linen was used
to wrap mummies.

The viewer who enters a small
room between display cases is
suddenly aware that this is indeed
an exhibit of the past. He finds two
mummies, part of the Albany In-
stituie's permanent collection, and
clay urns used to house the ashes
of cremat d r ~ous.

eCotpgnz M00“!

There is also a mummified cat-
with X-rays of the inside. A label
notes that cats were a favorite
Egyptian household pot and an eco-
nomic asset as well — they ate
rodents which threatened Nile Val-
ley grain crops.

in addition, selected cats lived
in temples and at death were mum-
mified and placed in tombs with
mummified mice to serve as food
in the afterlife.

In the cases of Egyptian arti-
facts is proof that Cleopatra and
her cohorts helped their beauty
along. An Egyptian woman probably
once gazed into a hand mirror on
display -. and the same woman
might have mixed her cosmetics on
a fish-shaped palette, dated 3200
B.C.

For those viewers who prefer
the influences of Greece and home,
there is a mastoid cup from the
Greek period, assorted water jugs
and a Corinthian-style bronze hel-

met, dating from the third century
B.C.
Roman Bust ‘

The head of a classic beauty,
presumed to be a Roman copy of
a Greek work from the third cen-
tury B.C., stares placidly from the
Greek and Roman relics.

And there are fragments of carved

columns, one with acanthus leaves
thought to be from the House of the
Vestal Virgins. v
' Other cases feature items fro
China and Japan, a ceremonial coco-
nut grater from a Hindu templetin
lndia, and colorful ceramic dishes
from Persia.
