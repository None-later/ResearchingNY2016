As new Managing Editor and former Sports Editor
Harold Lynne justly stated, we do have the desire to
make the sports page of the ASP a reliable, efficient,
and responsible university news medium.

It is our belief that the sports page should provide
State fans not only with the facts and figures of by-
gone contests, but also previews of upcoming games
and matches. A sports story should give complete
coverage of an event, not just the skimpy details of
how one team won and the other lost.

One of the greatest attributes of athletic competi—
tion is the human element involved. Itis for the sports
writer to dig beneath the glory of victory and the
emptiness of defeat and give the readers the complete
story behind the event. '

Though a sports story can’t give the writer’sopinion
of a game. the weekly sports column should contain
compliments, questions, and, of course, constructive
criticism. This column will dealexclusively with State
athletics, and will leave the handling of national topics
to the big-time mass media.

If we of the sports department can provide ASP
readers with the qualities we deem necessary for
a successful sports coverage, we will be fulfillingour
ptzifrt in keeping you abreast of a vital part of campus

e.

Tomorrow night in the Armory Albany’s talented
basketball team will play rival Siena College in their
second game of the year. Siena—State games have al-
ways proved exciting duels. and the Feds are sure to
be fired-up to avenge last year’s loss to Siena.

This year’s basketball team could easily prove to
be State’s finest in recent years, and will surely pro-
vide Albany fans with many thrills and triumphs.
Will you be one of these fans?

Attendance at the Albany—Siena games is always
excellent. for everyone enjoys seeing a rivalry be-
tween two top teams battling for the prize of honor.
But what about the other dozen home games State’s
hoopsters will play? We hope that the Siena turnout
will not be an exception, but rather an example. in
exhibiting State_§pirit.

_ V. _ p cage season. THE GAME is on the agenda for this
Saturday {night in the Armory. This is the game where records are thrown out the
~ window and both" teams play with a clean slate. It can be compared to Army vs.
Navy or Southern Cal against Notre Dame, it is all or nothing. Regardless of what-
,er advantageous team may or may. not have over the other. the game can be ex-

Since the contest orig-
inated twenty-five years

' ago, the Siena games have

always been a high int
of the year for State. The
Indians lead in the classic
11 games to 4, with their
thrilling 36-32 win last
year.

Pods Field Veterans

Slate boasts an experienced team
as they head into the ’64-65 cam-
paign. “Doc” Sauers will probably
be going with Co-captain Dick Cros-
selt and Danny Zeh at the forward
posts, Bob Zeh, Ray Weeks, and
Jim O'Donovan holding down the
guard and center posts respectively.

Not to be outdone, rival Siena
College has its share of cagers who
could spell trouble for His Albany
crew. Opposing them, State will find
Rick Avella and Bob Milhizer at
forward, Jack Mulvey at center,

_ Ed Marakovllz, Frank Lichtenber-

ger, or Frank Cryan occupying the
guard slots.

Hoping to End Streak

If seems that this year's seniors
are pretty much in the same posi-
tion that West Point experienced
prior to last Saturday. State is sub-
merged in a six game losing streak
against their rivals, and hope to
break the drought before a large
partisan crowd.

Saturday’s tussle has the ear—
marks of a real thrilling and hard;
fought battle, and is THE GAME
that is a MUST for both team and
student body.

Wéiglltlifiing Started

Weightlifting and body building
have always been popular amonglhe
male students at State. Considering
the interest recently experienced,
it was decided to reestablish a
weightlifting club. This organization
is tentatively headed by George
Nagy, a resident at Waterbury ilall.

Mr. Nagy recently finished sec-
ond in the Eastern States Power
Lffl Championship held last month
in Boston. Lifting in the lightweight
division, Nagy lifted 299 pounds in
squat thrusts, 175 in benchpresses,
and 350 pounds in the dead lift soc-
lion. lie was sponsored by the Al-
bany YMCA.

Under club auspices, those inter—
esfed in this sport would have access
to a room reserved for weightlifting.
All that would be necessary would
be to procure the key from the main
office.

At present, a room in Waterbury
has been selected for this purpose.
and the club, approved by Mr. iialh-
away of the Alhlellc Department, is
expected to appear early in January.

All those interested in weight-
llfllug and body building should con-
tact Nagy through Student Mall.

J shall pay 1/3 of the tax.

1!. All students not paying the
full amount of the tax shall not re-
ceive a student lax card entitling
them to admission to events spon-
sored by Music Council and Dra-
malics Council. All students shall
receive a student lax card pro-
viding for all campus publications.
This includes publications for which
the card is usually punched.

111. Music Council and Dramatics
Council shall esiablish a student
rate of admission for those not ad-
mitted free by student tax.

IV. Par t — time undergraduates
and all graduates may receive tax

._. leges of full-time undergraduates
upon payment of the full student
tax.

There shall be two lax cards.
One shall list all those events which
require or have required the punch-
ing of the tax card. This card shall
be given to everyone paying the full

those events which require, or have
in the past required, punching ofthe
lax card with the exception of those
