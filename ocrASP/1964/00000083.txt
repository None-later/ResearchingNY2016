It began Friday evening with Siena’s blare—wagon
blandly predicting an Indian scalping of Albany’s
hoopsters, and ended Saturday night with 75-49 Ped
hard-court triumph. It had to be one of the most
athletically successful weekends in recent years at
State.

Albany’s mat victory over Brooklyn Polytech Sat—
urday afternoon was very satisfying to coach Joe Gar-
cia for numerous reasons Most of his wrestlers com-
peted in heavier divisions. yet the team won six of

' the nine matches, three by pins. Gene Monaco,_ in
particular, was outWeighed by 14 pounds but still
scored a shut-out win over his opponent. Dick Szy~
manski turned in a fine performance in his first
collegiate wrestling match, pinning his Brooklyn toe
in the first period.

The frosh grapplers displayed some of the potential
coach Bob Burlingame hopes will blossom into ability
before long. Tom Guilfoyle and Paul Rosenstein both
looked like they have the makings of being consistent
winners.

Coach Bill Schiefflin's freshman basketball team
produced the most exciting win of the day as the squad
exhibited clutch shooting and ball—handling in the
overtime period to nip Siena’s frosh. Larry Marcus.
and Laurie Peckham have been the team's leading
scorers and rebounders and are good, steady players.

The day’s “main event" turned into a rout early in
the first half, as "Doc" Sauers fired-up Peds com.-
pletely outplayed Siena’a demoralized quintent and
breezed to an unbelievably easy win. Siena learned the
hard way that double-teaming Dick Crossett won't
stop Albany with shooters like Ray Weeks, Danny Zeb.
and Jim O'Donovan on the court.

if. was a dark and empty Saturday night in Siena —
a night that justice was done —- the Pigs were killed.

Gene lives in Schenec-
tady and attended Mont
Pleasant High School where
he was an outstanding
wrestler. It was in high
school where Joe Garcia

became interested in Gene.‘

Garcia recruited Gene and saw
his efforts well rewarded when Mo-
naco became a top collegiate grap-
pler in his freshman year.

As a sophomore he went unde-
feated, chalking up a 10-0 slate. In
going unvanqulshed Gene became
the record holder for most wins in
a season, and his clean record was
only the second one in State mat
annals.

Gene entered in the Four 1 Tour-
nament in Ohio and finished fourth
among some of the top wrestlers in
the nation.

Heading into his junior year Gene
had the additional burden of being

the “man to beat." Gene was de-.

feated, but not before rolling up 15
consecutive wins, another record.
His record for that year was 10-1,
scoring 36 points.

Gene's two year record is 20-1.
The 20 wins is a record for a two
year man, and is only three wins

shy of being the record for three
year men.

Monaco is one pin away from be-
coming the record-holder in career
pins. Also within Gene’s reach is
the three-year record (23), the four-
year record (20), most wins in one
season (10), and most pins for one
year (8).

Gene is off to a fast start this
season, copping the Hiram Tourna-
ment 123-pound title, and winning
his first league match despite a
14-pound weight handicap.

If you’ve never seen a college
wrestling match, better get down
to Page Hall some Saturday and
watch a real champion at work.

Riding a two game win-
ning streak, the Ped hoop-

' sters travel tomorrow to

face an unbeaten squad.
The Sauersmen will try to
avenge the 62-54. 93-52
defeats of last year.

In the 91-52 defeat of a year ago,
the Feds played a game against
Brockport the night before and, as
a result, the team’s performance
was not up to par. This year the
team will have three days rest.

The Pod offense this year has
been powerful, averaging seventy-
five points a game. Dick Crossett
has been the leading scorer with
an average of twenty-six points a
game. Jim O'Donovan and Ray Weeks
have tallied thirteen and twelve
points a game, respectively.

Coach Sauers’ 2-1-2 defense
hopes to hold the Buffalo attack in
check. Buffalo will be determined
to sustain their three game win
streak to stay in contention for a
bid to the NCAA Small College
Division Championships. Norwood
Goodwin and John Thompson“ are
the leading scorers for Buffalo.

Thus far this season, the State
cagers have a 2-1 record, defeating
Siena 75-49 and Southern Connecti-
cut 78-76 and bowing to Montclair
’77—’71. '
