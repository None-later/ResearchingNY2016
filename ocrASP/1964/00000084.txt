Dickens on Christmas

Christmas time!

That man must be a misanthrope indeed in whose
breast something 1in a jovial feeling is not roused
in whose mind some pleasant associations are not
awakened- by the recurrence of Christmas.

'There are people who will tell you that each
succeeding Christmas is not to them what it used to
be: that each succeeding Christmas has found some
cherished hope, or happy prospect of the year before,
dimmed or passed away; that the present only serves
to remind them of reduced circumstances and
straightened incomes- of the feasts they once bestowed
on hollow friends, and of the cold looks that meet them
now in adversity and misfortune. Never heed s'uch dis-
mal reminiscences.

There are few men who have lived long enough in

' the world, who cannot call up such thoughts any day

in the year.

Then do not select the merriest day of the three
hundred and sixty-five for your doleful recollections.
but draw your chair nearer the blazing fire; fill the
glass. and send round the song; and if your room be
smaller than it was a dozen years ago, or if your
glass be filled with reeking punch instead of spark-
ling wine, put a good face on the matter, and empty
it off-hand, and fill another, and troll off the old ditty
you used to sing and thank God it’s no worse....

Reﬂect upon your present Blessings- of which
every man has many— not on your misfortunes- of
which all men have some.

Fill your glass again, with a merry face and con-
tented heart.

Our life on it, but your Christmas shall be merry,
and your New Year a happy one.

-Charles Dickens

glad to see that students feel strongly enough about

deal of trouble to have her remain.

What was unfortunate was that the students Cir—

A brief talk with President Collins would have re—
vealed that the faculty had’ already taken positive
and effective action. »

The petition automatically assumed that the faculty ‘I
did not share the students’ concern for retaining
Madame Wolkonsky. Such an assumption is repre-
sentative of an attitude which can devastate any mean—
ingful cooperation between faculty and students.

This “University” will not become a university in
the true sense until a dialog based on mutual respect
and trust is established between faculty and students.
Responsibility for establishing this dialogfalls heavily

on the students.

' Vliiitti Went for Christmas

by David Child:

Having lived in Albany and superficially knelt at
her idol of enlightenment for a bit over three months,
I have felt my senses grow enormously. Asa knuckle-
hcad in the wilds of Oneonta, where lspent four years
lighting off indians and nature, 1 had peasant pioneer
tastes. Previously in each of the four years at Christ-
mas I would write to SUNYO Claus asking him for a
warm pair of wool trousers, a new axe, good spring
planting weather, the arrival of the lost pony express
rider, reinforcements of cavalry, and for my mind a
copy of Poor Richard’s Almanac (we were unaware
that publication had ceased.)

But now, 1 have miraculously become urbanized,
worldly, bourgeois, ambitious and greedy. This new
life of society and intelligentsia has quickened the
pace of my life, awakened my latent tendency to envy
and covetousness. Though l have limited my exposure
microscopically to all that this burg offers, I cannot
bound my desires. These then are just a few of the
things that I would like in my stocking:

just his quick Swiftles.

' Department of Speech and

Dramatic Art will present “The

Tiger” and "The Typlsis” in Rich-
ardson Hall Studio Theatre on Jan-
uary 8-9 and 11-16. The two one-
act plays by Murray Schisgai, who
wrote the current Off-Broadway
success “Luv,” are under the di—
rection of Professor James Leon-

rd.
Produced successfully off-broad-
way a few years ago, these iwa
comedies ore said to have “the beat

. of the generation.” Both are comic

and yet serious examinations of
man’s hopes, aspirations, and de-
sires.
Bawdy and Offbeat

Both combine the rare mixture
of bawdy fun and off-beat humor
with a sometimes tragic, but al-
ways tongue-in-cheek, comment on
human frailties. The comedies have.
been described as being “repre-
sentative ‘of the new wave of Amer-
ican dramaturg'y at its vibrant best.”

“The Tiger” was first seen in
London in 1960 and was presented
a year later at the Edenburg Fes-
tival, where ‘t. was received en-
thusiast‘. lt is a wonderfully
funny 9) on oftlieman-woman
relationship m a comic reversal of
dominant characters. The two roles
are. played by Tim Atweil and Chris-
tine Smith.

Two Role Comedy

“The Typists” is also a two-role
comedy..Jon Barden and Diane Som-
ervllle star in thls‘intensive study
of - the comic cliches of roulinized
existence.

Mr. Leonard feels that the Studio
Theatre is most appropriate for
the staging of these two plays. The

intimate audience and actor re-~

latlonships should enhance the re-
sponse the plays demand. The Studio
Theatre seats 114. All seats are on
a reserved seat basis. Tickets are
available at the Richardson 279 box
office from 10:30 a.m. to 3 pm.
daily. Admission is by student tax
card or $1.50.

A GOOD TOAST in the true holiday spirit draws together people
from all walks at life in friendly camaraderie.

A three-member panel explored
"The Absurd‘ University” at the
Golden Eye ‘Coffee House Friday
night, by beginning with its l‘ab-
surd" motio, "Lei each become
what he is capable of being."

Dr. Kendall Bll‘l‘, Dr. William
Grimes, and Mr. John Reilly, the
panelists, agreed that this was not
the goal of the University or the
University’s students in practice.
As Dr. Blrr expressed it, there
is “a striking gap between the ideal
and the real.”

They felt that part of the problem ‘

lay in the motivation toward the
practical aspects of education, i.e.,

obtaining a degree in order to make -

a better living. With this attitude
many students go through college
taking the easiest courses they can
find, as long as requirements are
filled.

The panelists felt that there was
not enough recognition that educa-
tion is a process aimed at an un-
derstanding of oneself and one’s
life goals.

Holiday Season Toasts Bring Cheers
ToChristmas, NewYear’s Celebrations

Whether it’s skoal, salud or
cheers that's exclaimed. the toast
is the shot heard ’round the world.
It rings out wherever there'slaugh-
for, love and liquid.

Oddly enough, this happy custom
had a solemn start. The ancients
drank to their gods and their dead
during religious rites. It wasn’t
long, however, before some good-
time Greeks got the idea of drink-
ing to the here and now.

The Romans were even heartier.
They complimented their lady
friends by draining a cup for each
letter in the damsel's name. On-
doubtedly the hostess with 'the
mosies' syllables won the popular«
iiy poll.

Dr. Elliott Speaks to SEA oti ‘lssthha
Problem: is Middle testers Colleges

Dr. Matthew Elbow, professor of
Social Studies, spoke last Thursday
to the Student Education Association
on the problems of teaching Midle
Eastern students in American uni-
verslties abroad.

Dr. Elbow spent his first year
abroad at Beruii College for Women
in Lebanon, which is under the aus-
pices of the Presbyterian Church.
Tile college is noted for lisprepara-
tion of women for work in medicine,
social work and teaching.

Dr. Elbow said that ii is more
important to ‘educaie \vomen than
men in the Middle East for awuinan
will teacher her family and they,
hopefully, will teach future genera—
lions while a man’s education ends
with himself.

In Turkey, despite u compulsory
education law, parents are loathe to
Send their daughters to school, and
Dr. Elbow considers it tragic when
a woman, 'accustpmed to an intel-
lectual atmosphere in college, is
forced back into tradition by ar-
ranged marriage whlizh she does not
want.

The main pleasures that Dr. lil—
ltiiw found in teaching Arnbimn Wit-
men were their Iluspillllil). ihnir

FINKLE '

It wasn't until the 17th century
that people called a toast a toast.
The term derived from a quaint
English custom of ﬂoating a piece
of toast in the drink to improve its
flavor.

A Toast of Bathwoter

The legend goes that 3 lord once
visited a lady after her bath. The
gallant gent filled a wineglass with
the bathwater and announced that he
would drink to her health.

His sensible sidek-ck advised him
to pass up the drink and take lilo
toast instead — meaning the pretty
girl who had recently floated in that
particular "punch."

For a long lime after that, ladies
were called “toasts” and toasts
were drunk only to ladies. Britons
often toasted their true loves on
bended knee.

Scois' weré more athletic. Scots-
men claim that they have drunk to
auld lang syne for over 200 years
with one foot placed on the table,
the other on the chair. Try that
next time you say, “bottom upl"

Although American toasting pro—
cedure couldn’t lie simpler (just
stand, clink and drink), our toasts
are among the most colorful in the
World. Who hasn't heard or said,
“Here’s mud in your eye?"

The Last Round

The phrase was born in pioneer
days when a farmer, about to leave
town and head west, would stop at
the tavern for a last round ofdrinks
with the boys.

The thought on everyone's mind
was: would the new land he rocky
and hard to plow, or would the soil
be soft and rich. ilirowmg specks
of mud into the eye of the man be-
iiiiiil the plow? The master hoped
for the latter when he said, "llei'e's
lllllll Iii your eye.”

Since then, we’ie toasted love
and war, mother and "whey—we’ve
eieu [trusted the bunk. 'I'llel‘e are
tender tennis and diyly humorous
trues sur'ii us Mark Twain's Willi-

cism: “Let us toast the fuels --
but lUl‘ lllelll the reel of us could
not succeed."

Not itiu surprisingly, the ladies
rciimlh our liesi—Iiilihleil slllljel‘l.
"llei‘e’h iii the illi'illl‘uh (Ill my desk.
May llll.‘_\ l|e\‘(ii‘ inept.” lb the ml-

lege iiiuii’s dearest wish.

A Sallor’s Solute
’i‘lic b‘lllliil' raiser; his glues to
this mic: “llct'e's to the 5|”le of
our navy and [be indies (if tilil' lﬂllll,

May the first be well-rigged and
the latter well-manned.” Not to
be outdone, the Army man says:
“Here’s to the ’soldier and his
arms/Fall in, men, fall in. Here’s
to woman and her arms/Fall in,
men, fall in."

Other diversions receive their
due. The amateur fisherman isn
forgotten. “Here’s to our fisher-
man gold/llere’s to the fish lie
caught/ Here's to the one that got
away/ And here’s to the one he
bought." I

There’s even a toast for those
who rarely work. Hobos raise their
mugs ihusly: "Here’s to de holi—
daysl Bless de hull i’ree hundred
and sixty-five of 'eml"

And in an entirely different vein
is file toast offered by Tiny Tim
in that immortal Story of Christ-
mas good will, “AClirlsimas Carol:
Here’s to us all -.God bless us

everyone.”

sily is in faculty-student, relations.
Mr. Reilly pointed out» that f'ln a-
real Unlversiiy there is not a'spllt
manifested by segregation of fat:-
ull and students by custom, ira-
tliticn, or perhaps preference.” . 1
After discussing this matter with-’

in the panel, the question was opened ,
to the audience. Response indicated ;

that many students felt that there
was indeed a split, and that it was
often started, or at least encour-
aged, by the faculty.

Some blame was also put on ihe~
geographical features of the school,
as bus schedules and the spread-
oui nature of the‘ca’mpus made it
difficult for students and teachers
to get together to talk for any
length of time.

New Campus No,improvottient

The new campus was not seen as
an improvement, since plans at the
present call for offices separated

from classrooms and faculty eating ‘

facilities segregated from those of
students. 7

In summing up the formal part of
the evening, the panelists gave what
they considered the assumptions on
which a good university is based.
These included "the positive effort
to extend to all the possibility to
participate in a democratic edu-
cation," an “active rather than
passive attitude toward learning and
a sense of involvement, and “eder
and abiding concern for education."

Free on liisisilay

Giving a liberal viewofihe week’s
news, the newsletter, the "National
Guardian." will be distributed free
in the the lower peristyles’l‘hursday
and Friday. An issue of the paper
normally sells for twenty cents.

The purpose behind the fre'e dis-
irihulioh
publicity and increase circulation.

Gary Delaiu, a State student and
subjscriber to the newsletter says,
"aside from its strong Socialist
bias, I find the ‘National Guardian'
a valuable source of information
concerning current events not ade-
quately covered in the daily papers.
In the hands of an intelligent reader,
it can be a valuable supplementary
source of news."

Delaiu ‘ciied the example of the
student l'lUlS at Berkley University.
lie called the American press's
coverage of the riots “inadequate
and inaccurate" while the "Na-
tional" gave a full report.

A limited number of copies of the
November 12 issue of the “National
Guardian" were distributed last
week. The y contained a compre-
hensive report of the Berkley riots
up to that time. The issue to be
distributed this week will contain
