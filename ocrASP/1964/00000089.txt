Informal Group to
Discuss Religions

The second riieeting of a new
group, “Speak Out," Will be held
Thursday. February 20. The open
meeting will begin at ti p.m. at IN
North Allen Street. The topic will
be "What Religion Means To Me."

The first meeting of the group,
held February 0, was attended by
sixteen people —- a larger number
than expected, according to spokes-
man Michael Stewart ’00.

According to Stewart, those who
attend “Speak Out" “recognize the
various organized groups on campus
and adrriit their worth," but also
contend that “formal organization
can defeat the very purpose oi any
group,"

For the latter reason, meetings
are strictly informal Without the
intention that those in attendance
must agree Wltli one another.

But llrivo to Aid

Native Uni Students

Students at Albany State have been
asked to contribute books to the
Thai Polytechnic Institute.

The institute is a recently or-
ganized technical training unit for
the education of native Thai. One
of the greatest needs of the school
is a library.

David Simington ’04, Minister of
Culture and Religion, has organized
a book drive. Books in any language
on any subject and back issues of
high-standard magazines and major
newspapers are acceptable.

Next Wednesday and Thursday,
February 19 and 20, will he collec—
tion days. Collection stations will
be established throtigliout the urti-
versity buildings.

Stations for the faculty will be
established in all of the annexes.

tories may liliiVU their books be-
tween the hours oi 0:30 and 7:30

Tuition Brings Protest From NY?
Alumni Seek Mandate Free Tuition

The tuition question is again being
raised as the City College Alumni
Association seeks mandated free
tuition at this session of the New
York State Legislature. At present
the four senior colleges are not a
part of the State University unit
where tuition is already in effect.

The Association is iiitentonkeep-
ing the City colleges tuition-free,
although the Board of Regents would
like to see uniformity between the
City colleges and the State Univer-

mandate would insure no
charge of tuition at the City schools
and perhaps provide hope for a
lowering and/or obliteration of it
at the State schools.

Wagner Sympathizes

Robert Wagner. Mayor of New
York, has rejected the CU tuition
plan on the grounds that there is
‘nc justification.” He also ex-
pressed his sympathy for the State
University units where tuition is
already being charged.

In regard to the State University,
State Assembly Speaker Joseph Car—
lino stated that some $22,000,000
would be realized from tuition char-
ges.

An Alumni Association spokes-
man, however, declared that, "The

State will only receive $6,000,000
from tuition...less than three per-
cent of the annual expenditures for
the State University. The rest will
accrue to the State University as
grants from the State in the form
of Scholar Incentive and scholar-
ship aid.”

The spokestnan called the system
“back-door borrowing.”

Pro-tuition Board
The state Board of Regents feels
that tuition at City colleges would
not only bring uniformity to the
State University system, but aid
the City colleges in their own ex-
pansion and development.

The Board further stated that an
“anomaly” (inequality) exists at the
CU community colleges. since the)
are being charged tuition.

Dr. Gustave G. Rosenburg,chair-
man of the Board of Higher Educa-
tion retorted, “If uniformity is de—
sired, let that uniformity be the
free-tuition policy.

lie has challenged state leaders
to show iioii-partisanship in the
tuition matter. He fears that the
legislators will feel obligated to
display their support of Governor
Rockefeller by not allowingthe free-

Co-op To Be Sponsor
0f Collection Contest

The State University Co—op, in
cooperation with the Student Asso-
ciation, will sponsor the second
annual Book Collection Contest. It
will be open to all students of the
university and will be held from
February 17 to March 6.

The book collections may be eti—
lered in the Co-op between Feb—
ruary l7 and February 29.

inutii of teii books, based on a sub—
ject area. A display of lists of
sample collections will be shown
in the Co-op.

merit, in duplicate, depicting the
purpose and/or intent of his collec-
tion. Also, he must state in which
category he wishes his collection
to be placed.

tiioiis, March 4, 5, and 0, the col-
lections will be judged by a cori-
test committee .: .tiiprised of mem-
bers of the student body and the
faculty.

The quality, the knowledge of
books as revealed in each collec-
tion, its value as a nucleus for a
permanent and personal library,
and whether it meets the stated
purpose are the basis for adjudi-
cation.

Judges Decision

The final decision of the judges
will be announced on March 0.
First prize will be $50 in books,
with fifteen additional prizes of
$15 each iii books.

The contest may be entered by
