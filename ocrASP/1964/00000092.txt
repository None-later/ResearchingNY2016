According to the Associated Col-

A Hairy Problem

Ted Clark ofthe Corrnectictit Daily
Campus, the University ot‘Connecti-
cut, is sick of people who do not
like beards and insist upon saying
So. He puts it this way:

A young lady asked me, "Why do
you grow a beard?” “Do you think
it makes you look good?”

But if I went up to her, as she
did Willi just an introduction, anti
asked “Why did you have your ears
pierced? “Do yoti think it makes
you look good?" or “Why do you
always say stupid things?“ I Would
be rude and irnpertinent.

l"tll' sortie r'eason,my beard makes
the sort of an unusual typeof animal
with no feelings. The beard gives
people, by what Sort of licensei
don’t know, the privilege ol'telling
tire after just meeting me: “I
don’t like your heard.”

I Like a Beard!
I don’t want to be titrfeeling, but

The Beautiful Girl is
0 Popular Product
One of America’s most popular

products — although the Russians
claim to have invented it first -
is the beautiful girl, notes The
Collegian, l"t‘t‘.‘~ilio State College,
Fresno, California.

Due to the fresh air or balanced
diet or something, the United States
produces 3.2 more beautiful girls
per square mile than any other
country.

Naturally, with such a super-
abundance of loveliness, Americans
applied to girl—watching, the satire
standards of ingenuity and enthu—
siasm seen iii inissile—protltit:tion
and tax evasion.

In other words, they organized
girl—watching as they did saiidlot
basebal!l into a family sport —
the tibi uitious (look it up) Queen
Contest.

The Cinderella Aspect

Romantic yvomeii thrill to the
Cinderella aspect of a poor pickle
packer troiri l’ixley being crowned
Miss International Sour IJill. 'i‘he
pretty girls watch and dream of
the day when llrey will be National
Cardboard Carton Queen.

The rest of us (known as the
liorriely Set) delight in pointingout
the corrtestrmt’s flat feel, bad lower—
lelt molar and the tiny freckle be—
liiird her knee.

If a group is going to have a
symbol, it might as well be an
attractive one, l"or instance, why
should the dairy industry promote
its image with a purebred cow when
a girl raised on milk looks so rrrticlr
better iir an eyeiring gown?

: Slow Expansion Marks College’s Scene

Students Determine Activity Pattern
Indifference Meets Many Events

by Debby Friedman

. Many students complain of the poor social life at State. The social calendar
is highlighted by several major events, but a wave of discontent prevails in

many quarters.
State College News

The problem of social life here was summed up in 1925 in‘the
and is still true today.

“There seems to be a general complaint that there is not enough social life

at State.

What is meant by social life —— parties, dances, games? Taken for»

granted that by social life is meant such, there isageneral complaint that
throughout the colleges and schools of America there is too much social life.

Did not the president of

Our social life consists

but one which is on a higher scale,

the Echo and German Club plays,
JIlllltil' weekend, club dances and a
sorority weekend.

During the years immediately
preceding and following World War
1, many clubs were organized which
added considerably to social life.
However, Greek organizations still
provided most of the activities.

Daily Dances

Daily dancers were held for many
years iii the gym. 'I‘he gl'mwas what
we now know as the lower library.
The Jtiiiior Prom, Post Exam Jubi-
lee, imd irrost dances were held
there. iioys were usually invited
from local colleges to these social
get-togethers.

A major addition to the social life
here occurred in Jul! whentlre first
real Cdlllplls Day was held. A stir—

we now know as lloriiecoriiingWeek—

cial calendar was Inaugural Week—

ary after student body elections are
held. 'l‘lrotiglr the eyeirt is only six
years old it is well established.

l)til'lllllttl'_\ weekends are also of
recent beginnings. They promise to
be as successful in the future as
they time been Ill the past.

Basketball Dances

Basketball dances. iroyvsponsored
by the Student Organization ofServ—
ices, are drawing more .rttention
this year than ever before. the
event is not a new idea. for dances
followed every Saturday night bas-
ketball game during the lulu soa-

The Grand Design

But what is the purpose or these
social activities? ’l‘here is more
involved to it than haying ir good

line. The planning and carrying
otit of these social eyeirts deyelop
the leaders of tomorrow.

It can be said th.rt the rrrore or—
