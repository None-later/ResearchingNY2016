Blitzed for the first time this
season, the frosh grapplers were
completely overwhelmed by Cort-
land State’s frosh and lost their
match 88—0. The match which was
held February 8 at Cortland, fea-
tured five pins by the lteddevils.

The frosh squad like the varsity
was hampered by its lack of depth
and had to forfeit two weight classes.

New Face on Squad

In this match a new face was
seen on the squad iii the person
of Robert Clark. Bob wrestled in
the hundred and sixty-seven pound
weight class and it is hoped that
he Will give the team the estra
depth that it needs for its future
matches.

To A Sports Editor Dying Young

Tuesday night in the office, the deadline ten minutes
away;

Three pictures and a story are missing, you fall on
your knees and pray.

Colgan is cursing the headline machine, Galu is
yelling at all.

That is the way the office has been since the second
Week in the fall.

Somehow you manage to make, the Lord has pulled
you Through,

But you still make those blunders like picking NYU.

Friday, the finished product laysinthehallin a stack.

By twelve o’clock in the afternoon the coaches are on
your back,

i tell myself I can make it, and it’s really just a
breeze,

But, finals prove it otherwise and I lose my last
three B’s.

Sports fans are very fickle as Casey musthave found,

The day the Mudville citizens ran him out of town.

When the English Department reads this, I’m sure
that I’ll be Hng,

That’s the reason I call it, “To a Sports Editor
Dying Young.”

What Happened to the Scheduling?

Certain people in the athletics department are not
happy with the scheduling of the Greek’s rush parties
this weekend. They feel that the team has many, many
games away from home, but the weekend when they are
playing two home games everybody’s got to rush. Since
the athletic schedule is planned very early they feel
an injustice has been done. Where will you be Friday
and Saturday night?

Thanks to the Senate for the money that will enable
us to print; two issues a week later in the semester.
It will be a great advantage for this department; of the
paper in bringing the most recent sports events.

Cortland Ramps Grapplers
Trounces Staffers 29-3

by Joe Silverman

The Ped Grapplers traveled to Cortland State Feb-
ruary 8 to wrestle against a powerful Cortland squad.
Cortland, a physical education school, prides itself
on its teams and their wrestlers showed their class
by defeating State 29-3.

They won every match except for one and collected
four pins in the one-sided victory. Gene Monaco, the
Junior from Schenectady, has won his last fifteen
matches and was the only Fed to win his match. In the
match, he won the team’s three points by takinga
decision. The Feds had to forfeit a weight class be-
cause of their inability to fill the 137—11). class.

On January 18 the squad traveled to Plattsburgh
State for a match. John Bennett, John Robb and Larry
Thomas led the team to 27—5 victory by pinning their
opponents. They lost the five points because of another
forfeit of weight class.

A week before the Plattsburgh match, the Feds
played host to Oneonta State and defeated them 20-14
in a close match. John Robb and John Bennett again
pinned their opponents and Gene Monaco contributed
with a decision. The Feds were again handicapped
because of their lack of depth and had to forfeit points.

Gene Monaco has yet to be defeated this year and
has helped the team in compiling their impressive
four and one record. He has won four decisions and
pinned one opponent in his five nn‘ttches this season.

HOBART ARRIVES SATURDAY
State Holds 8-8 Record After Splitting last Weekend

Continuing their busy home schedule, Albany’s Five prepare to meet the men

from Montclair State tonight.
will meet the Hobart cagers.

Close on the heels of the boys from N. J. State
Montclair State is new to the Albany schedule and

according to reports they boast a good squad. Going into the contest with an
8-8 record the Feds will have their work cut out for them.
Last weekend the State squad split two games, beating Pace College 65-61

and losing to Central Conn. 77-63.

During the semester break, Albany State

dropped two of three games, to Potsdam State and Oneonta State, while salvaging
only one at the expense of Utica College. Potsdam the leading small college
team in the nation for defense pulled out a narrow victory margin of four points.
Oneonta State was probably the upset of the year as they topped the men from

F rosh Beat Alumni 75-65
Alums Delight The Crowd

Led by Jim Constantino and Mike Bloom the frosh
basketball team staged an overpowering second-half
comeback to defeat the alumni 75—65 , February 8, at
the Armory. Constantino and Bloom, with 24 and 23
points respectively, were the high scorers in the an—
nual contest. Behind 38—32 at halftime, the frosh out-
scored their opponents 43-27 in the second half.

The alumni were, sparked by Gary Holway and Don
Cohen. This certainly was quite predictable since
this pair, in their Luidergraduate years, were the
most prolific scorers in Albany—State’s history. Hol—
way ’59 and (‘ohen ’61 contributed 14 and 12 points
respectively.

time the two teams met

by close to twenty points.

Pace Defeated

Pace College of New York City
made a long trip to the north only
to find defeat at the hands of home
five, 65-61. The State cagersfought
off a late rally to hold their wmning
four point margin. Jim O’Donovan
and Dick Crossett provided that
winning touch as they have so many
times in the past.

O’Donovan, a demon on the back-
boards, ripped the nets with twenty
points and hitting agreat percentage
from the field. Crossett, just as big
on the boards hooped seventeen
points in the game. Crossett was
ejected front the game because of
a misnnderstanding, with three mill—
utes left in the game.

Marty Eppner, Albany’s answer
to Vin Ernst, was the key to suc—
cess, as he came up with some
clutch baskets and broke the Pace
press with some deft ball handling.

The Pace squad was led by Tony
Focazio and Gene Westmorland.
Pace coach, Finnerty was very un-
happy with the officiating and was
warned repeatedly for protesting
too loudly. State’s own Dr. Sauers
was not overly pleased Withthe offi—
cials either.

State Bows to C. Conn.

The undefeated Blue Devils from
(,‘onnecticut remained so at the ex—
pense of the Peds last Saturday
night. Albany was unable to contain
the C. Conn. offense that has been

State stars.
