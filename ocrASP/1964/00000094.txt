Films Become M

by Paul Jensen

With the end-of-tlie year ten—best
lists announced and forgotten, and
the Academy Award nominations yet
to come, this middle period seemsa

good time to combine the two and
publish our list of the year’s best
films, as well as various and sundry
‘awards.”

This writer has not
seen all the films
that played in Albany

all those released
that year, so the list
is based on general,
but selective, view-
ing. The films ell-
gible are those put
into general release in ’63 and/or

 

in 1963, much less.

 

 

    
 

from the wrong direction.

A GUIDE FOR THE GUIDERS

(hie of the lnost interesting academic theories advanced iii
many a long year has recently been all 'anccd by that interest-
ilig academic theorist, E. l’lliribus Ewbilnk, Hi. I). who holds
the chair of Interesting Academic Theories at the St. Louis
(‘ollege of Footwear and Edlicatiomll Philosophy. l)r. Ewbank
said in the last issue of the learned journal, the Mount Rushmorc
Guide to Scholastic :Itll‘ttllt‘t'llll‘lll iiuif I‘rcsirlculs' Ilcails, that we
might be approaching the whole problem of student guidance

l)r. Ewbalik, a highly respected pedagoglie alld a lifelongr
smoker ol' Marlboro (‘igarettes, (I mention Marlboros for two
reasons: ﬁrst, to indicate the scope of Dr. Ew'liillik's brainpower.
(hit of all the dozens of brands of cigarettes available today,
l)r. Ewbank has had the wit aild taste to pick the one with the
lnost flavorful ﬂavor, the most filtraciolis filter, the most soft
soft pack, the most flip top Flip Top box: l refer, of colirse, to
Marlboro. The second reason I mention Marlboro is that I get
paid to mention Marlboro ill this collillill, alld the laborer, you
will agree, is worthy of his hire.) '

lint I digress. To return to Dr. Ewbank's interesting theory,
he contends that most college guidance counselors are inclined
to take the easy way olit. That is to say, if a student's aptitude
tests show ii talent for, let lis say, math, the student is encour-

aged to major iii math. If" his tests show all aptitude for poetry,
he is directed toward poetry. And so forth.

given their first Albany showing dur—
ing that year.

Of necessity, this excludes films
seen on television or through the
International Film Group, excep-
tional thou'gh many of them may be.

Best Films

Keeping this ill mind, the ten
best films, followed by the direc-
tor’s name and country of origin,
are

The Condemned of Allono (Vit—
torio de Sica, It.)

The Eclipse (Michelangelo Ali-
Tonioni, It.)

Hud (Martin Rift, Alli.)

A Kind of Loving (John Schles-
inger, Br.)

The Leopard (Luchino Viscoiitl,
It.)

Lilies of the Field (Ralph Nelson,
Am.)

Long Day's Journey into Night,
(Sidney Lulnet. Am.)

This Sporting Life (Lindsay Ali-
dersoli, Br.)

Tom Jones (Tony Richardson, Br.)

The Trial (Orson Welles, Alli.)

An interesting sidelight is the
growing international character of
films, which makes it increasmgly
difficult to pinpoint a picture’s ori-
gin.

Altona, for instance, has a Ger—
man, an Italian, and two Americans
in major roles, is directed by an
Italian, written ill English by an
American from a French play, and
filmed in Germany on American and
Italian money. Leopard and Trial

have the same problem, as will
several productions now being
filmed.
Best Actors
Long Day's Journey, using

O’Nell’s play as its script, is as
full of drama arid fine acting as the
films of Tennessee Williaius’ plays
used to be. Jason Robai'ds. Jr. is
Best Actor of the year for his per—
formance as the alcohollceldersou.
lie just barer overshadows Ralph
Richardson, as his father iii the
same film, and Richard Harris, lll
Sporting Life.

Katherine llepbllrn, as the insane
mother in Long Doy's Journey gets
the vote for liesl Actress. A good
performer iii the thirties and for-
lies, Miss llepburn seems to gel
even better with age.

There is lilili- or no coinpelllion

0.3. Show Bright Spot

  

In Set of A-D Plays

by Sklp Schreiber

The problems ofpresentingaone-
act play often reduce the returns
so substantially that one wonders
why productions were ever at-

tempted. So be it with two of the
AD plays.
In “The Happy Journey from

Trenton to Camden,” the fault is in
the play, not in the production, al-
though that did llave a few strings
begging to be tied.

The work is a diluted Our Town,
with many good features rather in—
eptly removed. What purports to
show “mother” as the backbone of
American society turns out to be
little liiore than the daily soap
opera, complete with mother brush-
illg a tear away.

Judy Stone’s direction gave lnuch
support to a poor script, although
five people bouncing about olichairs
seemed lliore like first-gradersde-
sirlng to avail themselves of lhe
facilities, rather than a family on
a short trip. Jamie Littlefleld and
Gail Glancola deserve particular
credit for their portrayals of Ar~
lhar and Caroline.

Ibsen Out of Context

Taking a scene from a three—act
play and expecting five people to
provide the same depth and inten-
sity as if they had acted the entire
play is a bit foolish. When one
does a cut frolii all Ibsen play,
the result borders on me ludicrous.

Cheryl \Verbln and Stuart Solo-
mon. in lhe last scene from A
Doll's House, were stiff and seemed
to be bored and completely olil of
contact with the meaning of the
play. Moi'Eover. llle obscure pro-
gram nole probably helped them as
iiilich as it helped the audience.
Under the circumstances, Pat Per.-
zulo’s direction was adequate.

'Bertho' Dead from Start
’l‘enessee Willlailis secilis tohave

Early Pattern of

found a gold mine in the south and
has for years been mining it with
all sorts of doubtful, neurotic wu-
men. In “Hello froui Bertha,”
which is rattler dull and uninter-
esting, he presents lls with three
prostitutes, one of whom is dying.
Unfortunately, the play also is mori-
bund.

Poor Bertlia’s activities have f'i-
nally caught up with her; and all the
attention she gets is a gripe from
the proprietor that she is uneco-
nomlcally occupying a bed. Perhaps
the play has some deep meaning
for all America, but it is certainly
cleverly hidden and positively oh-
scared.

Amelia Weiss and Susan Meir.
were excellent as Bertha andGoldie,
but Moya Zubowich seemed bored
with the entire business. Nathan
Piickett’s direction was excellent,
and the results were obvious.

Show Best of Evening

Although Shaw is not particularly
noted for his shorter plays, “l’as—
sion, Position and l’elrifaction"
should be on everybody’s shelf. In
it, he combines amateur theulrlcs,
lime-worn. corny lilies and biting
satire on English aristocracy. llis
wit crackles throughout the play,
and the delight lingers on.

Bob Willower’s directions care-
fully considered and integrated the
facets of the play to produce a fine
theatrical gelii. Mary Setter, as
Lady Magneisa, was positively ile-
llghtful. and the rest ofihecastsup—
ported her role excellently. It was
one of those f'ewproduclioils in which
everything combines lo produce an
excellent performance.

The second set of Al) plays was.
lechnically superior to die first
set. Part of this lS undoubtedly
due to the platforms which re-
mained from USA, affording a var—
iety of singing and scenery llll—
possible Willi only one level.
