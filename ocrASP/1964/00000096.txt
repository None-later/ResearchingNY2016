Art Johnston...

Q. Do you think runningunopposed
will hinder the carrying out of your
program?

. No. I most definitely do not.
There are many drawbacks and dis-
advantages to a candidate running
unopposed within a democratic or
quasi-democratic system. The ex-
ecution of my program, however,
will not be effected by this fact.

, In regards to government re-
organization, do you favor stripping
MYSKANIA of its judicial power?

A. A meaningful examination of
all of student government by all in-
terested parties is long overdue.
Present knowledge indicates that a
further evaluation of MYSKANIA’s
role is justified.

I feel that this evaluation tnust
lead to either a wholly honorary or
a wholly judicial body.

. In regards to government re-
organization, do you think the pro—

is the list of candidates seeking
office in the general elections.
The numbers after the names in-
dicates the number of Senate meet~
ings each candidate has attended.
The asterisks indicate incumbents.
A total of sixteen people will be
elected from each class to Senate.
Thirteen will be elected to MYS-
KANIA, and five to the Alumni
Board. Only one vote may be cast

Due to the late date for filing

posal to have the SA Vice President
chair Senate meetings is agood one.

A. Neither Senate nor any Vice
President is ready for such a break
at this time.

A greater executive role for the
vice president iii administrating
over Senate is, however, imminent
as may be first seen iii the up-
coming constitutional amendments
which help put both the President
and the Vice President in their
proper executive positions.

Q. Would you favor a substantial
rise Ill Student Tax if you thought
the monies would enable additional
services for the student body?

. If I and the Senate were cer-
tain that the monies were justified,
such a rise would be tnore than
favorable.

Q. Do you think Student Associa-
tioti is subject to too muchpressure
and control by the administration?

, There is altogether too little
contact of any sort. “'I‘ he pressure
and control” which seems exerted
results from a lack of understand-

Q_ Would you favor the creation
of a judiciary body separate frotn
MYSKANIA?

. The proposal for a separate
judiciary seems now to be the best
solution to MYSKANIA’s present
ambivalence iti role. Changethrough
evolution should not be feared and
ignored rather expected and planned
for.

Q_ What do you think of the pro—
posal to base representation inSen-
ate on student activities rather than

A. It is a possibility I have ex-
amined through Government Reor-

because in its pure fortii, this group
ignores non-group affiliated mem-
bers of Student Association.
