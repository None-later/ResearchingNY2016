The Happiness of Pursuit

Conniving coeds have made use
of the Duquesne Library to plan
their schemes, and their main
source of fair face and foul deeds
is enclosed within the covers of an
1846 English Best seller, Hints on
Husband Catching.

The Duquesne Duke, Duquesne
University, Pittsburg, notes that
the anonymous author of the book
gives tried and true methods of
making a girl’s next round-up her

“If you have good teeth, display

whatever your temper may in fact
be, a constant smile is very apt to

“This same steretype smile may,
of course, be dispensed with after
marriage. which will give you op-
portunities of proving to the poor
devil that “all is not gold that glit-

There’s this warning, however:

“One of the greatest dangers in- on

risk of her own heart becoming so

zeal outruns discretion and she
loses the tempting fruit from too

When a student enters Northern

Role As Census Taker Exhausts Volunteer

(‘HIIIIIIIH’I/ i’om page

In the summer of 1962, I and another
Volunteer spent one month in the Southern
Province doing preliminary field work for
the 1963 National Census. This census, the
first of its kind in Sierra Leone, proved to
be the most difficult, the most frustrating,
the most time-consuming and exhausting
task of my entire Peace Corps tour.

Since the country was so bereft of quali—
fied people, many Peace Corpsmen were
asked to assist in the running ofthe census.
Three of us from Schlenker School (two
more Voliuiteers were added in the Fall of
1962) were on the job from the beginning of
February, 1963, to the end of May, during
which time we taught what classes we
could at the school, but for a good part of
that period the school was closed, for even
the students were being used as enumera—
tors.

The entire story of the Census, and our
part in it, would provide ample material
for a study in itself, and it is too involved
for more than a cursory description here.

The problems attendant upon using pri—
mary and secondary school children (‘as'
young as 11 years) as cnumerators, using
people as supervisors who were completely
incapable of handling the responsibility, of
getting the cor fidencc of, and eliciting iii—
formation from thousands of people — these
led to my working 12—14 hour days, seven—
day weeks, for two months, with only oc-
casional rcspites.

All things considered, if furncdouf i‘utlict‘
successfully, in my opinion. I, liowcvcr,
came out of it physically and emotionally
devastated. I don’t for a moment i'ogrcf
having taken part in the Census, but I
shudder at the thought of ovcr having to
do it, again.

Living Conditions Fair

In many respects, the living conditions
were much better than i, or anyone olso,
was given to expect.

[be original l’eiico (ioi'ps “image” (as

misconccivcd by many) was that of a
dauntless and spirited young man, alone
in the wilds of darkest Africa, living in
the squalor of a mud but, with no water
or electricity, wild beasts lurking behind
and in every tree, attempting to bring the
lamp of knowledge to some recalcitrant
and illiterate save clad only in a loincloth,
spear in hand and bone in nose — some-
thing straight out of Edgar Rice Burroughs
(who, incidentally, never did see Africa).

Nothing could be further from the truth.
Many parts ofA frica may be underdeveloped
but they are civilized.

The staff quarters on the compound were
made of stucco, had concrete floors and
corrugated metal roofs, being plainly and
austerer furnished. We had running cold
water, electricity, separate bedrooms and
baths (luxuries actually — some Volun~
tccrs were not as fortunate, sometimes
having no electricity and/or no plumbing.

Our water had to be boiled for at least
ten minutes and then filtered before it was
considered fit to drink. About two months
after we arrived the Peace Corps provided
us with a refrigerator — an unexpected but
more than welcome addition to the, housc—
hol'l.

by Pat and Don Jewell

Due to the widespread demand
for more intellectualism on cam-
pus, the ASP has decided to print,
from time to time, columns such
as the following, which will help
to intellectualize the students at
State. (Now that we have lost half
our readers...)

There are many and various the-
ories as to how language developed.
Seine people say the cave men at-
tempted to imitate the tweets of
birds and the grunts of animals,
and this later developed into the
somewhat more sophisticated Eng-
lish language (or whatever language
a group spoke.) But we may Wonder
how our complex vocabulary evolved
from these few simple grunts and
tweets.

Word Evolution

Perhaps some new light may be
llll'iini on the matter by tracing the
eyoiniion of a word. Imagine your—
self back in the Paleolithic era. It
is a bright morning. and the birds
arc iweeting iilltl the animals grunt—
ing in the forest as a dirty f'zHOlllliii
iiawls out of his hole and lifts his
{,iistl to scent the wind.

Suddenly fear comes iiitohis littlc
pig-like cy es, and they turn red with
fear .is he senses the much dreaded
sabcriooih tiger. 'l‘urning, he \t‘lll-

squealing :i warning to his family:
“I'bi! Ilbil”

One Word — Many Meanings
i.ci us stop here a moment and
examine the word —— “Uhi.” lip-
'.clopcd iii a moment of iieccssitj..
wunoui much deliberation or fore-
thougni, ii is a seemingly innocuous

little Word. Yet we see there is
a definite inner layer of meaning
when spoken aloud.

There is the sound of loneliness,
of probing, of searching, of fear.
But since yvords were scarce then,
it had to be used to expressaiarger
range of feeling.

At first the meanings were more
related: for example, the word is
used by a grubby little child, clad
only in soiled bearskin diapers.
looking for its mother, sniffingeach
adult feiiiaie in turn and uttering
piaintiveiy, “Ubi..ubi..” From a
squeal of warning, if has been
changed to a plaintive wail.

Yet, still more diverse meanings
needed to be expressed. and so the
word became further changed.

Examples of Change
When, for instance. it wife was
caJoimg her husband to fetch wntei',
she Would say —- in the most honied,
pleading. flattering tone, “L’bee'?
Ubee'?” and this could not fail to
bring a layoi‘abic rcspnisc from
ihe husband, unless. of course. he
was an ill~iempcred Stilt, in which
ruse he would clout her solidly
several times upon the bend wtth

a club shouting ‘L'bibi—ubi!”
'l‘lie childien. swinging from yine
to '. illt‘ illlll seeing one, of theircom-

paiiions falls, would choi'tle with
glee and point from theii pci'clics
in the trees at the friend lying

ignominously below. and cry taunt—
ingly . “Oobi, ()obii”

And when the tribe would assemble
for a least, upon seeing the food
they would cry in anticipatory de—
lli',lit. [‘l)()till',‘ iioliy'l"

Language Development
After this brief exemplary des—

ALBA N. -'

cription of a word as it was used
by the earliest people, we are ready
to proceed with our theories as to
how language developed. We see
there are many moods and feelings
to be expressed which necessitates
different methods of expression.

'l‘wo main solutions were found to
express the varieties of meaning —
both of which we see in use In our
examples. One was a difference in
inflection — the same Word is used,
but said in a different way. This is
found in the Chinese languagetoday,
where one word may have as many
as ten different meanings. depend—
ing on how it is said.

The other way is to time a coni-
pietely different sound, and if you
noticed, the sound of “UM” became
changed somewhat along with the
inflection. We liiid this today in
English where we have millions of
coiiiplctely' different syllables to
express ourselves.

Later Development of "Ubi"

liui, perhaps you are Wondering,
what became of that wonderful 0\-
pressive \voi'd“ubi.” Latinstudcnis
may already haw, recognized if as
being direcin taken over by ilie
ltomuns io mean where (“ubi”) and
indirectly in theexplanntion“lieu!”
(alas: it is silent.)

In German “Ach” is doi'iwd, no
doubt. from a \Lii‘lLilltilI of ubi, and
likewise the l- rench "on" ulill“:\li"
coming from lild —
meaning, like flllll of

And now. what should you haw

History of 'UBI’ Proves Fascinating

Sympathy For Sure losers Even
Appears For Perennial Also-Raps

by Joseph W. Galu

Modern America is in love with
the underdog. We sympathize with
the New York Mets who will never
win even one—third of their games.
We sympathize with Floyd Paterson
who Will never say die, until he’s
dead.

This sympathy for the sure loser
manifests itself in politics, espe-
cially on primary day. Several of
Kefauver’s primary victories were
written off due to the sympathy vote.
Yet Somehow this vote disappears
by election day.

It is this disappearance of sym-
pathy vote that creates the also-
ran and the perennial also-ran. The
most prominent also-runs are, of
course. Stevenson, Bryan, Dewey
and Stassen; but there are other
also-runs who have rim and lost
many more times than the big four.

From N. Y. C.

In New York City in the county of
Queens there are four congression-
al districts. Mark Siai r, 11 Liberal,
has run in three ofibcse four dis-
tricts. Once he receiyed as much
.is t;.ii5’,‘, of the total into.

In the Bronx Solomon (Iowan has
rim as a Liberal in tour elections
and receiyed us much as 15.1% of
the vote.

1944—1964

Not all :iiso—i'aiis are New York-
ci‘s. In Missouri. William McKinley
'l‘honias has Hill for the Republican
noiiiinaiion for United States Sena—
tor in men election since 1944.

He has ne\ei' men won the pri-
diary or the liftiilillllliliii let alone
Wiiiilllii.’ .in election. This year he
is traing .nuun only this time he
is opposing \etcruiiItcmociiii Stuart
Syniingion iii the lteiiiociatic pri—
m;iiy.

i.ar i)ltl\ has gained considciablc
fame by losingeiociionsaiid.ippear—
lug on the Jack I’aii Show in an
Uncle Sam snii. His most ictcni
venture was his uiteinpi io inn
against I*.'\e:'ctt McKinley l)iikseii.

Tradition Broken
In Nebraska, trunk is. Morrison
until 1900 had the wet, desciycd
reputation ofiic\ei losinr.ipi'iiiiai'y

and never winning an election. In
1960 he won the Governorship as
Kennedy polled less than 40% of the
vote. Both ran as Democrats.

In 1962, Morrison surprised al-
most everyone by winning reelec-
tion. Now he is running for a third
time and the Republicans are
searching for a candidate. Morrison
shows than an also-ran can make
good eventually.

Theodore Green, long time Sena—
tor from Rhode Island, did not win
an election until well into his six-
ties. From that point forward he
never lost. He retired from the
United States Senate in 1960 at the
age of 93.

It s not necessary for a candl-
date in New York State to run on a
minor party t.cket to do miserably.
lleiiry D. Dorfman ran as a Re-
publican for Congress in 1948, 1952,
1954. and 1956.

In 1956 he Scored his most im-
prcssive showing garnering fully
22.3% of the vote cast.

Good and Bud

Why is any of this important?
There are several reasons. The
inability of Worthless candidates to
win II primary or a nomination des-
pite their determination shows one
of the best sides of modern Amer—
ican politics.

The inability of a good candidate
to Will no matter how often he or
she runs shows the bad Side of our
system. A candidate virtually must
be from the dominant party in an
arca to be elected.

This shows up one of the worst
aspects of American politics — the
safe district. Extremely few dis—
iiicts present the possibility of a
