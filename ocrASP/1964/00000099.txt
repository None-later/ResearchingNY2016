Paul Sheehan: A Dedicated Atlilete

Father, worker, student and var-
sity basketball player, that is Paul
Sheehan. Herb Philbrick complained
that he led “three lives,” well, he
was just a piker compared to the
dynamo that captains our varsity
basketball team.

Paul is a graduate of Fort Edward
High School, north of Albany in the
Adirondack Mountains. It wasthere
that Paul showed his potential as a
basketball star. He led his team to
the league championship.

He was an all around athlete in
high school and excelled in football
and baseball, as well as basketball.
St. Bonaventure was first to utilize
his potential as a college player.
Dissatisfied with the Bonnles, Paul
packed his bags and headed for Al-
bany in 1960.

Basketball at State
Patti began playing ball for “Doc”
last year. He commuted almost
forty miles each day, but still found
time to play hoop. Considered a
short man in basketball, (he is
5’ 10”) Paul has had to master ball

THE INNER MAN

College is fun and frolic and fullﬁllment—except for one
melancholy omission: we don't get to enjoy Mom’s home
cooking. (In my own undergraduate days, curiously enough, I
did not undergo this deprivation; my mother, a noted cross-
country runner, was never home long enough to cook a meal
until her legs gave out last Arbor Day.)

But most of us arrive at college with fond gastric memories of
Mom’s nourishing delicacies, and we are inclined now and then
to heave great racking sighs as we contemplate the steam
tables in the campus cafeteria. Take, for an extreme example,

li‘inster, a freshman at one of our great Eastern universities
(Oregon State) came to college accustomed to home, cooking of
a kind and quantity enjoyed by very few.

HAMMING

IT UP

by Ron Hamilton

The United States, since the Modern Olympic games
were started, has always sent its teams via contribu—

tions of the American public.

Each fourth year the

Olympic Committee begins a campaign to raise the
money required to send the best athletes, as deter-
mined by competition, to the Games.

The reason this has been the policy for so many
years is that the Committee feels that such a team is
truly supported by the American people. Many nations

subsidize their teams with government funds.

So me

people in the world of sports think we should do the

same.

I think that these are the people that are not

interested in our teams, The real spirit of the Games
has been lost with people like this.

We all want to win as much 8 possible, but we must

also

realize that every athlete at the (Tamas is, re—

gardless of his origin, trying his best to win or his
country. Let us not drag the good will and friendship,
promoted by the Olympics, into the mud of the Cold
War. The Olympic Games pits the skill of individuals

against other

The greatest honor that can be, given to an

Each time the method of private contributions has

tice.

STATE OUTSOORES HOBART 80-75
O DONOVAN PAGES SAOERSMEN

Sweeping to a commanding first half lead, the varsity basketball team defeated
Hobart College, 80-75, Saturday, February 15, at the Armory. Led by Jim O’Don-
ovan and Dick Crossett the Peds moved to an early lead and held it throughout the
contest. The halftime score was 41-29 in favor of Albany. Although stumbling a
little in the second half the team was able to retain its lead.

Albany was sparked by an extremely well-balanced scoring attack. Jim O’Don—
ovan was the high scorer with 24 points. Dick Crossett chipped in with 18 points
and Dan Zeh, Paul Sheehan and Bob Zeh each had 10 points. Excellent foul shooting
was also a key factor in the team’s victory as the Feds sunk 26—31 from the foul
line. This victory brought the season’s won-dost record up to 9-9.

Lose to Montclair

The night before, Feb-
ruary 14, Albany lost to a
