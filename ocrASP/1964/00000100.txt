'Janes’ Deserves Critics’ Praise, Dylan Improves Style of
Concise, Witty, Imaginative Film

by Paul Jensen

A great deal of high praise has
been lavished on Tom Jones. In
fact, not only is the film being
universally enjoyed, it is also crit-
ically “in” to rave about it. The
surprise is that the picture de-
serves most of this praise.

It is a lusty, roar-
ing comedy — tre-
mendously cinemat-
ic, and excellently
acted. It proves that
good (imaginative
and actually funny)
comedies are not
things of the past,
and that Britain’s "angry young
men” do have a sense of humor.

 

Eighteenth Century Tale

Tom (Albert Finney) is a found-
ling who is irresitlbly attractive to,
and attracted by, females of all
sorts. The plot, typical of its 18th
Century source, is extremely coni-
plex, withimportant characters pop-
ping up, disappearing imtnediateiy,
only to reappear when one has
nearly forgotten them.

Very simply stated, it follows
Tom’s pursuit of the virtuous Sophie
Western (Susannah York), and his
various extra affairs along the way.
There are many sub-plots, how-
ever, including one about hisritother
that could have been utterly taste-
less but for the great good humor
of the film.

There are, iii fact. so many char-
acters and narrative threads tttat
it is amazing that the writer (John
Osborne) arid director (Tony ltich-
ardson) managed to pack it all into
a iiiere tWo hours.

Skilliul

They do it through a kind of cine-
matic shorthand, which wastes no
time and moves the plot at a break-
neck clip. Any means available are
and barbarlty of such scenes and
characters make the film much
more than Doris Day fluff lii period
costumes.

The acting is fine throughout the
cast, but Albert Finney is particu-
larly good as the roguishpicaresque
hero.

Grlltlth Exceptional

Hugh Griffith, though. steals the
show as Squire Western — a dis-
gustingly dirty arid vulgar man who
is iione-the—less utterly hilarious
Griffith definitely looks the part,
wallowing with pigs, sleeping among
his dogs, and constantly trying to
drag some wench itito the hay.

The film’s beginning is mislead-
ingly weak. The first scene, of the
baby Tom discovered iii Squire All-
worthy’s bed. is presented as a
silent film, with piano background
and title inserts. Though it is a
cute idea, there is really ‘llUtlllllg to
laugh at here.

A narration follows, bringing us
up—to—date on Tom's affairs; this is
confusingly presented, andshouidbe
clearer.

But once the characters are in-
troduced and the plot established,
there’s no holding back and, while
the humor inevitably flags at times,
it's generally an elaborate. bawdy,
and boisterous coitiedy With a fast
aitd funny presentation sittficteiit to
eliminate arty threat or poor taste.
The director’s citietrtatic imagina-
tiott, plus the social t't)llllll(‘lll pro-
vided, is enough to make Tom Jones

more than a very entertaining filin—
it is a tiiost important one.

The hunting sequence, however,
has not been praised enough. Ex-
ceptional photography is obtained
through various methods, including
the use of a camera mounted on one

of the horses. Rapid editing lil-
creases the realism and excite-
merit.

But it is not funny, and succeeds
iii giving this wiltl romantic comedy
another dirrteiision. Social criticism
is included, unobtrusively. iii this
scene as it great crowd ofhorseiiien
and dogs go poundingafteroiie small
deer.

The animal is finally caught arid
dispatched by the dogs. The realism

used, including Richardson’s usual
sharp ctits from the ittiportatit part
of one scene to another, without
fully ending the first.

Asides and gestures, “unob-
served” by the rest of the charac-
ters and made solely for arid to the
audience, are also used.

The Joy of it isthat these'dricks”
are not only utilitarian btit also
tremendously fttnity and cinematic.
Indeed. Richardson itiakcs the most
of his camera, never trying to hide
it arid occasionally bringing it into
the action. as when’l‘ottr coyly places
his cap over the lens to blot ottt ottr
\‘lSltill.

flirt with all its speed or exposi-
tion. the ftItti doesn’t hesitate to
pause arid dwell on certain scenes
that give the film more body. An
example is the eating scene Witlt
Tom and one of his loyes. It is
funny arid well played, but ototlj.
praised.

Lyric in New Release

by Stuart Salomon

Usually when a new column is
published iii a newspaper there is
some form of introduction included
which outlines the writer’s purpose
and his background in his particu-
lar area.

i will get around to that promise
task next week, there is something
far more titnely oti the folk scene
now. This is Bob Dylari’sriew album,
The Times They Are A-Chongin
(Columbia 2105).

Fans of Dylan will be jubilant,
even those who dislike his raw style
rust itiiglit find liitit irresistible this
time. Because on this new ctit Dy-
lan’s words are far tnore eloquent
arid his music far more melodic
than on ltis other two albums.

Writes Own Songs

On this release, till the songs
Dylan sings were written by hitti-
self. SUlllt‘. songs, of course, titt—
pressed the more than others did,
bttt I can say that there aretiosotigs
which I didn’t like at all.

My favorite was the title song
of the album, “The Times They
Arc A-Cliatigirt’.” Iii this nutriber,
Dylan’s energetic, rebellious phi-
losophy tells politicians. parents.
and writers that these arc times
of transition and that changes must
be made.

In the past year. .t \y'omanseryant
was killed because she was struck by
the tillle of a rich man. 'l‘hcro was
ito reason for his action and be was
mken to court andchtirged with riittr-
dot liecausc ot the influence of his
wealth he received a six—month
sentence. Dylan doscriltcs this lil-

cidetit in, “The Lonesome Death of
Hattie Carroll. ”

Uses Evers Case

Atiotlier murder, more notorious,
is related iii “Only a Pawn iii their
Game." The tragic death of civil
rights leader, Medgar Evers is ex-
plained by Dylan’s belief that the
actors in the tragedyoflastsummer
were victims of a situation over
which they had no control.

“Boots of Spanish Leather" is a
love song similiar to an earlier
Dylan recording, “Girl From the
Nortlt Country." The latest song
very successfullydepictstheparting
scene between a sensitive lover and
his riot—so-seiisitive mate.

The longest song on the album
(7:05), “With God on Our Side, "
is a poignant cotittiieritary on the
wars of the United Status and the
belief that God is with us.

Way With Guitar

Dylan’s skill as art iristt'iiiiiori—
talist is evident in the “llallad of
llollis Brown.” because as Dylan’s
yyor'ds tell of poverty and doath his
guitar criesot loneliness and monot-
otty.

The rctrtntntttg four songs illi'
good. ltlll .trtt morsliudowod ly the
power of the other six. The Dylan
enthusiast Will delight fit his new
poont Wlllr'li appears both on tho
hack of the album and in a special
insert.

My roar-tron to llttll Dylan botorn
hearing his tit-v. album was one of
cttstttil tolcration nowltceltarrnoio
enthusiastic about llllll. I tool heltus
a lot to sift.
