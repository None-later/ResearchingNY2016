lnconsideration? — Why is it so hard to find chaperones for social
functions? It seems that the same faces are seen at nearly every event.
Noteworthy — Congratulations to the Greeks on their pledge classes.
One question — does the end always justify the means?

Anticipation? — February 29 is at hand. Where have all the smiles gone?

Unimaginative - the method by which the Music Department chooses
choral groups. Possibly a selective basis might stimulate those with
true ability.

Grievances — it’s too bad that in recent weeks, the Senate floor has
become an airing place for personal feelings. A warning to new senators
—— you’re representing your class as well as your self.

Uncertainty - There seems to be a great deal of it as regarding the new
campus. Do you know where you are going to live next year?

Referendum — Was it valid or invalid? Do the students here really
know what their student government is doing?
Apathetic, arrogant, able, antagonistic -— What type of Senator were
you??

Theft — There seems to have been ati outbreak of stealing in the dorms-
and Co-op this year? Are we, as so-called college students that small?
interest, initiative — The past S. A. President tried to stimulate both.
It’s too bad he was met with such great opposition on the part of a few
senators.

Organization ~ Election Commission has finally achieved a satisfac-
tory voting procedure.

Nominations — The process for nominating candidates for office is on
a par of most grammar schools. We hope that the new administration
has something more valid in mind.

Baker, Kenna Expose Systems

by Jo'seph W. Golu

No one party ill America has man-
aged to obtain a monopoly on cor-
ruption. If this were not true, it
would be easy to vote out all corrupt
officials and their party.

The actual situation leaves the
voter in a more difficult position.
Two current examples point tip this
unhappy circumstance. The system
which creates the examples is, in
my opinion, more to blame than the
men involved.

In New York City the Republican
organization in Queens is the site
of the most shameful New York State
example. In the 1961 iiiayorality
campaign, the Republicans charged
Mayor Wagner (D-LOlwitli having a
scandal a week.

Few Civil Servant-

'l‘lie Democrats countered with the
satemetit that the people involved
were civil servants and not patroii—
age appointments. Also the number
of people in the scandals was very
small.

As the campaignprogressed, sev—
eral people. were exposed and forced
to resign. The Republican leader
in Queens resigned. This man,
ltobert Kenna, was the only “party
inan” involved iii any of the scan-
dais.

The resignation was reported in
all the papers and retracted the
next day. That Kenna will not seek
i‘e-eiection to his partv post was
the excuse. Last year he was for—
mally replaced by anaffablenobody.

Rule by the Disgraced
A few weeks ago the Republicans

met to choose their new district
leaders. (There is no direct pri-
mary election of GOP district lead
ers in NYC). Kenna, with no official
position, chaired the meeting and
dictated the slates of candidates.

Because the election is far away
all parties and the major newspapers
ignored the story. This example
gives a rather clear insight into the
attitude of both our parties and the
so-called reliable newspapers.

Iblame the system in this case
because there is no foriii of rep-
resentative base involved. The
people of the individual assembly
disti‘i.:‘. cio not choose their party
leaders. (This is the most basic
goal of the reform movement in the
Democratic partv.)

Baker's

On the nationa level, the Bobby
Baker "case" is providing lots of
headlines for newspapers which wal-
low iii sensationalisni. Baker,quite
clearly, has had extensive dealing
which may involve him in some
court cases.

The Republicans, largely iii the
person of Senator John J. Williams
(lb-Del), have been pressing the
case with all reckless abandon. The
results have been sotiie of the slow-
est, iiiost laborious trackingdownof
facts ever.

it is clear that the Democrats oii
the Senate rules committee hope to
drag otit the investigation ill the
hope that the public and its infor-
mants (radio, TV, and the press)
will tire of the case.

That Senator Siitatliers aiid the
late Senator Kerr were involved is

dii'iicuit to deny. Kerry was a
Democrat; Smathers is a Demo-
crat Republican John J. Byrnes

of Wisconsin was instrumeital in
getting the smiling wizz-kid started.

Byrnes’ tearful speech on the
House floor brought crocodile tears
from both sides of the political
aisles. It was a typical speech of
“My God, my God, what has this
awful, dirty man dotie to clean,
little ‘country, flag, and mother’
loving me?”

Symptom is Part of Disease

The guilty party in this case is
not a political party but a state of
mind. This state of mind is the Es-
tablishment of the llouse and the
Senate.

It is a group of willfttl little men
from hopelessly safe (for their party
and them) districts. They have no
fear of being defeated since they
often own the state organizations

The worst sin in the Senate is to
criticize the system. The system
is one of favors and deals. It stinks
from the corruption it has \viuked
at. ignored, helped, and created.

Bobby Baker was created by the
Congress. Congress is not going
tO‘WQSll its linen unless forced to
do so.

Until a very few \vorthwhilc men
like Democrat Pall] Douglas and
Republican Clifford Cass obtain
enough support to destroy the sys—
tetii, this syteiii will continue and
continue corrtipt and corrupting.

Student Serves as Military Advisor in Strife-Torn loos

by John Hunter

“When they hit us at Ban l’ndong,” began

,‘ State student Jack Savage, “we had 2000
,Meo troops and they came in with 3000
‘ Pathet Lao troops. We held out until they

brought in two 105 mm. howitzers. When
the 105’s were in range, we pulled out and
spent two days in the jungle until Choppers
came in and took us out.”

This was the start of none hour interview
with Sophomore Jnok Savage, a veteran of
over three. yours who was assigned to one
of the Army Spccial Forces units stationed
in Laos.

“l voltiiitcorcd forSpocinl Forcesbecause
it is the host outfit in the Army,” Jack
continued. “After basic training, I was
sent to Jump School at Fort Bragg, North
Carolina.

At this time, i was assigned to the 82nd
Airborne Division. Each man in a Special
Forces unit is a specialist, trained in one

field and cross—trained in all others.

A Special Forces team consists of two
medics, two demolitions men, two weapons
men, two radio men (commo men), one
intelligence sergeant, one team sergeant,
one executive officer, and the team leader
(00).”

“l was a radio man, and after radio
school, i was sent to Eglin Air Force Base,
Florida for Ranger Training. Next came
Jungle Warfare School in Panama. After
that came Cold Weather Survival School
in Utah. Next came language training.

The school for Laotian and Vietnamese
is at Fort Bragg. I wenttotlicono at Bragg.
Finally, my unit trained with the Navy UDT
(Underwater Demolitions Team) units iii
St. Thomas, Virginislands.”

“The primary mission of any Special
Forces unit, trained to infiltrate enemy
lines in war by land, sea, and air, is to
organize, train, and equip giierilla troops
in conjunction with the local g’tlcl‘illﬂ oom—

tﬁ, 

 

mander in the area. Once you are sent
into an area, you are in there for the
duration,” Savage continued.

“The big problem in Laos was the fact
hat there were only 350 Americans sta-
tioned there. The Lao Army consisted of
26,000 troops. Some of the officers were
French trained, and were good comman-
ders. Most officers, however, were inept.

Another problem was .re‘ligion — the
Buddhist religion. The Buddhist religion
prohibits killing and the Lao troops had to
be forced into combat. With only 350Amer-
loans, not enough pressure could be ap—
plied to make the Lao forces effective.

The exception to this unwillingness to
fight, however, were the Meo. The Meo
live in the mountains in northern Laos.
They were good fighters and were organ—
ized into a gucrilla force. The Mao force
was separate from the regular Lao Army
and quite effective because of extreme
anticommunist feelings.”

“Ban Padong was the Meo stronghold,”
Jack went on. “When the Pathet Lao hit
us, the regular Lao Army force with us
chickened out and left our right flank
open. Because of this, we lost a large
part of the Meo force.
