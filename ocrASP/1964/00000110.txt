Student Finance: Growing Comlexiit

Board of Finance Levies
First Student Tax in 1919

by Debby Friedman

The creation of the position of
Student Association treasurer and
a larger Finance Committee were
two proposals advanced in the recent
S. A. elections. It was hoped that
this would facilitate the handling of
student monies.

The complexity of student finan-
ces necessitates these changes now,
just as other changes were deemed
necessary in past years. Simplifi-
cation of procedures was the mo—
tivating force behind each modifi-
cation.

Student Board of Finance

In 1917 and 1918 finances were
at rather loose ends as there was
no definite source of revenue for
the growing number of student ac-
tivities. There was also no or-
ganization to supervise the budgets
of groups such as the newspaper
with revenues.

Thus the Student Board of F1-
nance was formed in 1919 to man-
age the financing of student—run
activities. To finance those en-
deavors the Board decided that each
student must pay a blanket tax.

Every student would benefit great—
ly from the tax. The first levy was
set at seven dollars. The budget
was a fraction of what it now is. It
was a relatively slrnple task to de-
cide on the amount of that first tax.

The difficult part was getting the
students to buy the tax ticket. Over
half of the students did not pay the
tax, and budgets always had to be
cut. In 1937 President Brubacher
made the tax compulsory.

Complex Duties

The duties of Finance Board were
complex. The eight student mem-
bers had to prepare budgets for
every organization financed by Stu-
dent Tax and submit them to the
Student Council for approval.

The final budgets were then sub-
mitted to the students for final ap-
proval at a compulsory weekly meet-
ing. Then, as now, appropriations
of under fifty dollars could be ap—
proved in committee.

The specific duties of the Board,
according to the Constitution that
preceded the document we now have
were many. It had to provide allor-
ganizations receiving money from
the S. A. treasury wrih uniform sets
of books anti instructions for their
use.

Statements Issued

A bi-rriorrthly statement  A. fl—
nances containing the current re-
ceipts and expenditures of each or-
gariizatron had to be published. The
members had to make sure that all
rrrorrey earned by any organization
Would be put into the S. A. treasury.

 

g‘ﬁb o

 

 

 

 

The board investigated and acted
upon requests for extra funds from
surplus and authorized line trans-
fers within already approved bud-
gets. Budgets oforganizations which
violated any procedures could be
frozen.

Class Board of Finance

Until 1957 there was also a Class
Board of Finance which consisted of
the vice president of the S. A. who
served as chairman, and the treas—
urer of each class. The treasurer
of the board was a faculty member
appointed by the president of the col-
lege.

The members had to publish abi-
monthly statement of the class fi-
nances containing current receipts
and expenditures of the classes. It
also had to collect class dues in
cooperation with the S. A. officers
who collected the Student Tax.

New Financial Policy
During the past year definite fi-
nancial policies have been set gov-
erning room rentals, travel by S.A.
members, and advertising revenues.

The 1963-64 Senate made several
recommendations to the new Senate
regarding financial policies. A
graded Student Tax is under con—
sideration. Each student would be
assessed according to the benefits
he derives from the fax.

According to the Student Evalua-
tion report, the budget procedure
passed by Senate makes the prep—
aration of the Student Association
budget an executive function.

Budget Reclassification
“This means the executive may
classify budgets as he wishes.” A
reclassification of budgets was rec-
ommended. There would be four
major divisions.

The communications section
would include the budgets of Carri—
pus Viewpoint, ASP, WSUA, Printer,
and Student Director.'Pi'ograniming
would include Dramatics and Arts
Council, Forum of Politics, Music
Council, Student Peace Group,
8.0.8., and Debate Council.

Camp Board, the Department of
Recreation, and the Fencing Society
would come under recreation, and
the budgets of MYSKANIA, Campus
Commrssron, Cabinet, and Senate
are classed as governmental.

The Board was supervised by a
charrrrian and .i treasurer that were
appointed by the president of the
college. When 'he new constitution
was passed In 107.7, the lioartl of
Finance as a separate entity was
dissolved. and a I'main-eCorriuiittee
Within the Student Assocratrt.itiSeiiate
was created.

Now, and iii the last decade of
the ffKI‘ﬂffllf't‘ of finance Board, the
collection of Student Tax has been
taken over ty the administration.
Budgets are ho longer submitted to
the ontiro student body for approval.

S. A. Treasurer

The new S. A. president writ pro-
babty appoint a treasurer for Stu—
dent Association, as a cabinet leycl
position. The nine member It‘inanco
(,‘oriirnitteo Will probany remain
the sumo site.

Another com.idoration iii the re»
cent elections was a change III the
time when a new budget Will be
passed. It the plan goes through,
the current Senate wrll pass two
budgets in this session, and suc-
ceeding budgets Would be passed
at the end of each Senate year.

'l‘hose are the rriuior changes in
finance through the years. As the
student enrollment grows, it is in»
eittnblc that more changes thI be
made in the future.

This shows just how much influence the
Pathet Lao had.”

Jack continued by saying that neither
the Vietnames nor the Laotians have any
understanding of democracy or comm—
unism. These people support the com-
munists because they would be shot if
they didn’t. Support for the guerrilla
movement comes from North Viet Nam
and Red China.

Someone estimated that four or five mil—
lion people in Viet Nam support the com-
munists and the rest don’t care.

“There has been a big build—up in
US. personnel in Viet Nam,” Jack went
on. “But of the approximately 13,000
troops stationed there, nearly 70% are
administrative personnel.

Mao Tse Tung, Red China leader, wrote
that “People in a country are to the guer-
rilla as water is to fish.” These people
are not nationalists. Their loyalties are
to the villages they live in. The problem
is in defending these people.”

Taking another drag on his cigarette,
Jack continued by saying that until re-
cently, the strategic hamlet, or defended
village, seemed to offer the best solution

to this problem of defense. By grouping
several villages into one compound, it
was reasoned that defense would be pos—
siblc.

Now, however, the Viet Cong nrosti'ong

these strategic hamlets and win, using

force can use conventional tactics and win,
the guerilla have the upper hand.

“You see, guerrilla warfare isthe same
all over,” Jack continued. “The Viet-
namese are extremely vicious and very
good fighters. They are about the best

guerrilla fighters in the world, and man—

Current Comment
____________.

by Joseph W. Colo

The New York State legislature is
often called the best state legislature
in the nation. Such comments cause

 me to mourn for the other 49 states.

If one forms a judgment of the two
branches according to their current
performances, one condemns our
state government.

The houses assemble each year

: for a period of three months. The
f 208 men and women are the highest
'.paid state legislators in America.

The voting procedures are such
that in committees everything is
secret and on the floor deals assure
unanimity on virtually all issues.
All committees are stacked so that
there is no IWo party conflict.

Few Dedicated Men

Neither party nominates its best
men for the legislature. Many
outstanding people have served;
most leave the bodies as soon as
possible. Except for the majority
leadership and a few committee
chairman. there are few outstand—
ing men.

The current session is faced with
many problems. Rockefeller isbusy

with extra-curricular activities
ericii keep him out of the state.
This is an election year and the

legislators desperately want to be
able to show the voters some ac-
Corriplishments.

The biggest problem is that of
the budget. For three years now,
the budget has been balanced due
only to gimmicks and one-shot non-
recur'ririg items such as advancing
collection dates [or various taxes,
recalling loans, etc.

Rockefeller Balancing Act
This year the budget must remain
balanced. The state constitution re-
quires the governor to submit a
balanced budget, but it does iiol
require ,the legislature to maintain
the balance.

Since Rockefeller" is basiriga large
part of his carripurgn on lllS bal-

legislature Ignores Needed Reforms;
Presidential Race Removes Executive

anced budgets, the budget will re-
main balarrced one way or another.

The legislators have backed away
from the reform legislation which
is needed — gun reform, court re-
form iri New York City, surrogate
reform. and prison reform not to
mention conflict of interest legis-
Iatiori.

The legislators seem willing to
bring home to the voters only a
record of expenditures for all the
usual things. Education is at the
top of the list, as always. There
is not enough money in the budget
to increase the amount of aid.

The result of this is agitation
for either the use of bonds author—
ized by the voters years ago or the
increase of the cigarette tax by one
more cent per pack. Neither is
considered offensive to the voters.

Both are offensive to Rockefeller.
This brings us to the crux of the
matter.

Needs and Frustrations

Tire legislature desperately wants
to do something, but it can do only
those firings coiiSisterrt with Rocke—
feller'in his philosophy and Rocke—
feller in his role as a presidential
aspirant.

The results so far has been a
distinct lack of leadership from
Schuyler Mansion. This is due to
the facts that Rockefeller is out of
the state very often and that Mal—
colrii Wilson is the Lieutentant Gov—
errror.

Wilson is far enough right tohave
a very small circle of friends —
Robert Welch, Edwin “Ted” Wal-
ker (the retired general), John Rous—
selot, Willlarri Buckley, and John
Tower. Wilson is too far right to
lead even the general conservative
upstate Republicans.

Virtually all major legislation is
bogged down in corrrrriittees where
lobbyists are getting their way and
the people of the state are getting
nothing. What little legislation is
progressing is being watered down
and made rriearrrrigless.

Government Intervention Inconsistent

by J. Roger Lee

Government intervention into the
Workings of our economy are gen-
erally arbitrary and violate the
spirit of objective law.

Even in regard to so basic apoint
as the purpose for which interven-
tions are made there appears to be
no basic definable principle on which
these government's actions are
predicated.

In late 1960, the federal govern-
ment took legal action against twan-
ty—riine major pro-
ducers of electrical
equipment. These
firms. among whom
were General Elec-
tric, Westinghouse,
and Allis-Clialrriers
were charged wrth
price fixing, that is,
entering into agree-
ment to set the prices of their
goods at a higher level than the
market Would bear in the absence
of such an agreement.

 

This was done
to the effecs on
firrris involved.

wrtlrout regard
the electrical

Executives lmprisioned
In this case‘s decision (which
sent seven corporate executives to
prison) if was held that this act of
price fixing was against the “public
interest,” since the agreement was
_1rr restraint of competition,

in this case, “public interest”
was held to be superior to botli the
economic Well beiirg of the indus-
tries involved and best servedby the
attainment of the low consumer
prices that come about as a conse—
quence of unfettered competition.

Recent Ruling

The Tariff Commission was pre—
sented with a case in which Austra-
lian cliroiiiic acid was being sold at
a comparatively low price incerrairi
sections of our country. The effect
of this was to cause the market
price of chromic acid to drop.

On February 26, 1964 the Tariff
Commission decided, “When
chrornic acid purchased frorii Aus-
tralia at less than fair value is sold
in the United States at a price Sig—
nificantly lower than all domestic
inar'rufacturers’ wholesale prices of
the like product in the United States,
thereby greatly disrupting and de-
pressing prices in a major United
States market for such product...
such sales of the importer product
are anticompetitive.”

The Tariff Commission placed a
duty on chroinic acid in order to
raise the price of the product to-
ward the level it had attained prior
to the entry of the Australian acid
into the market.

In one case, the government, in
order to provide the consumer with
low consumer prices, acted to keep
the price of consumer goods down
to the level at which competition
would have set them.

Dissimilarity
No single unifying principle of
government intervention can be dis-
cerned from the two examples given
above.

Jim

in the second case, however, the
government acted, not to keep the
prices of consumer goods down to
the level at which competition would
set them, but rather, acted to set
the prices of cliromic acid at a

.liigher level than the market would

hear in the absence of such an

action.

Still Price Fixing

This is nothing more than price
ﬁxing by edict instead of agreement.
In the first case, competition was
said 0 have been avoided by an
actroh which prevented the desir-
able altercation of prices in the
market place and the consequent
drop in consumer prices.

In the second case it was the
altercation itself and the price drop
it caused that were said to be anti-
competitive.

Since a rriorai code is a body of
principles by which an entity regu-
lates its actions, it follows that any
entity, be it an individual or a
government, which acts withoutpre-
dicting that action on a principle or
set of principles, is totallyimmoral.
