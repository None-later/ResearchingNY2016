HAMMING

IT UP

     

by Ron Hamilton 

.5.

The scene is the Cobleskill gym and the time is
Friday night, February 28. The gym is filled since
it is the last home game of the season. The game
highlights the Albany State Frosh against the home
town men. After the Aggies completed their warmups
the Peds still had not made an appearance. The Peds

were back in Albany raging.

It seems that when the game was scheduled Coach

Neil Williams understood

that the team was going

to play on the 29. The Cobleskill Coach understood
that the game was on Friday the 29. Unfortunately
Friday was not the 29. I wonder what the Cobleskill

fans thought.

Who Is “The GreatestH

To end all debates (it “Who was or is the greatest
athlete of all time?” we have searched the archives
and have unanimously decided on Commodus. He was
the son, illegitimate of course, of Marcus Aurelius and
was a fanatic when it came to sports. He did just about

everything and then some.

We couldn’t possibly go in

to some of his feats, but to give you some idea of his
prowess, he was undefeated in 734 gladitorial contests.

Apologies to the “manager” of Dick Crossett for

leaving her out of the story

in last week. Sorry

It is not that I have any thing against Wichita,

but i

am going to curse them any way by picking

them to win the NCAA Tournament.

ARMORY SCORING MARK SHATTERED

Led by Dan Zeli’s all-around play
in the second half, the varsity bas-
ketball team coiiipleteiy reversed
its sloppy first half form and went
on to tout Utica College, 85-50,
Monday, March 2, at the Armory.

The Peds, iti this, their finaJ
game of the year, produced a new
team scoringrecord for the Armory.
DOI) Gruel, playing in his last col-
lege basketball game. threw in the
record—breaking two points.

The early portion of the contest
was dominated by Utica as State

appeared to be feeling the effects
of their nine day layoff. The Peds’
play was marked by poor passing
and weak hall—handling. Utica
jumped to an early 20—13 lead.

Quick Comeback

Then Marty Eppner came off the
bench and combined withDickCros-
sail to spark Albany’s comeback.
Just before the end of the first lialf
the Peds produced a fifteen to two
spurt to move decisively into the
lead. The halftime score was 43-32.

Dan Zeh paced the second halfat—
tack with his scoring, rebounding,

bounding struggle.

Jim soon justified his coach’s

going into every match Wiili at

least three or four forfeits. This
has made it virtually impossible
for the team to compile a winning
