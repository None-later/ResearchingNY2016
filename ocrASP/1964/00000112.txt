‘Citizen Kane’ Genesis of Modern
Technique; 'Single Greatest Picture’

by Paul Jenson

This Saturday evening the inter-
national Film Group will present
Citizen Kane. This is an event of
particular importance, as the film
is one of the few that can definitely
be designated as a landmark in mo.-
tion picture history.

It’s been acciainted by many, in-
cluding Bosley Crowtlier of The
N.Y. Times, as the single greatest
picture ever made; it was so far
ahead of its time in technique and
content that it still stands, over
twenty years later. as a remark-
able achievement.

The picture will lie shown in
Draper 349, at the usual times of
7:00 and 9:15.

Welles a Prodigy
The major reason for the film’s
success is the character of its

creator, George Orson Welles. Born ‘

in 1915 in Kenosha, Wisconsin, he
was ati infant prodigy and received

not formal schooling until age ten.

In his early twenties he produced,
directed and usually starred iii var-
ious Broadway productions, includ-
ing Dr. Fruustus,an all-Negro Mac—
both and a modern-dress Julius
Ceaser.

At the same time he achieved
great popularity on radio. He was
the original Shadow (“What evii
lurks itt the hearts of men? Only
The Shadow knows for sure.”), and
presented both adaptations and orig-
inal plays on The Mercury Theatre
of the Air.

One of these adaptations occurred
on the evening of October 30, 1938,
and has since becotne a public
legend. This was his version of
The War of the Worlds, which cre-
ated quite a panic by convincing
many that we were, in reality,being
invaded by Martians.

Inevitably this “boy genius” was
brought to Hollywood. RKO-Radio
Pictures signed him, and assigned
itobert Wise then a film editor, to
acquaint the novice with tlte tech-
niques of film-making.

After two unrealized projects —
Too Much Johnson and Contrad’s
Heart of Darkness-- Welles began
work on the filth that was to be
Citilen Kane-

Welles acted as producer, direc—
tor, star and coewrtter (with Her—
man Mankiewicz). The imagina-
tive youth’s ignorance of film tech—
niques was ati advantage. for many
of the effects he conceived were
declared “impossible” hy Wise.
Welles, undaunted, attempted them
anyhow, and with the help of his
photographer Gregg Toiattd did much
that had never been tried before.

He also borrowed heavily from
other directors, such as Griffith anti
von Sirohelm, but ill his hands, and
combined With his innovations and
the techniques of sound he had
learned in radio. they seemed new.

Hearst the Target

IiKO had given llllll a free hand,
arid during shooting, rumots ap—
peared as to the controversial utt—
turo of the flliii. When finished, it
was a thinly-disguised story about
the newspapet king William ltan—
dolph Hearst. Hearst,loutrheddcep—

ly', threatened to wage war not only
against RKO, but also every other
studio.

Scared, the Studio heads pleaded
that the film be suppressed, or at
least modified, but Welles held his
ground and consented only to a few
cuts in the dialog.

This seemed to placate Hearst,
and the film was released. But
Hearst nonetheless permitted no

 

advertisements for the film to ap-
pear in his newspapers.

Achieving the Impossible

Kane was generale acclaimed as
revolutionary, attd so it was and is.

Although not the first to put ceil-
ings on his set, he was the first to
make them work to his advantage.
He was the first to use sound natur-
ally and to have voices in conver-
sation overlap ottto and interrupt
each other. The breakfast table se—
quence with Kane and his Wife is a
masterpiece of time condensation.

But tlte greatest aspect of Kane
is the purer visual quality winch
Welles has never lost. But although
he has Since used it With mostly
inferior material, he here has a
St'l‘llH of consequeni‘t'.

the quality of Kane.

In his recent The Trial, the story
once more fits his unusual visual

Book Review

 

 

 

 

The State University Theatre will conduct auditions

for

its fourth and final production of the season,

Raft of the Medusa, on March 10 and 11 in the Studio
Theatre (R 291) at 7:30 p.m. There will also be an

afternoon audition on March 11

at 1:30 pm. Those

involved in the State University Revue whose rehear—

sal schedule conflicts

with evening auditions

are

encouraged to attend the afternoon audition.

The cast will include fourteen characters; six boys
and six girls between the ages of nine and twelve,
and one younger child. Only one of the fourteen
will be portraying an adult. The age ofthese characters

will provide a

unique opportunity and stimulating

Challenge for the students of the University.

The play, by the controversial German playwright
George Kaiser, concerns a group of children marooned
for seven days on a small rrft. The play, a searing
comment on Christianity and the human condition, is
a stimulating experience for the technicians as well
as the actors because of the universal requirements of

the production.
Mr. James Leonard,

who

is directing the play,

is most anxious to have a large number of students

audition.

In case a student should wish to

become

more familiar with the play and the roles that are
to be filled, he has put copies of the play on reserve
in the library under his name.

He emphasizes the fact that no previous acting
experience is necessary. There is also a great need

for people who are

into rested

in technical work.

The staff hopes that through this production many

new persons

will be incorporated into the dramatic
activities of the University.
