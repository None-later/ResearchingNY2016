(continued from last week)

“The re were opportunities to make many
jumps and attack i’athet Lao units hut. we
couldn’t. talk the Royal Lao troops into doing
it.” Jack continued. “’l‘hesc people are
apathetic. There, is a parallel to this situa—
tion in Viet Nam.”

Jack went on hy saying that the apathy
comes from the fact that these people don’t
want to lose fare. iteeause there is a ehanee
of losing, there is a marked i‘eluetanee to
fight.

“There was eonstaiit troiihle with the Lao
officers,” .laek said. “\\e eould eontaet
l’atliet l.ao units, hut instead ot pushing the
advantage, and wiping out the whole group,
these people would settle for getting them
on the run. If the l’athet l.:io ran. it was :i
\‘ietory, and the laoti'iiis would settle for
killing it) or 13 instead ol'killingr the wholl-
group."

“it, was during these mortar duels that
things got hairy,” Jack continued. “A 4.2
mortar sounds like a freight train coming
down on top of you.”

Lighting another cigarette, Jack went on
to say that three men in his team were killed
in Laos. The team leader, Captain Moon.
and Sergeants Risehoff and Bitter. They
were killed in a village overrun ll_V the
l’athet Lao.

The full details were. never known hut
apparently ("aptain Moon was killed during
the attaek. ltilier and iiisehi’df were appar—
ently wounded and later liayoneti’wt heeause
they were not aide to mai‘eli.

Two more men were killed later in South

Confused Situation

laos was a e infusing situation. I‘ausing
to light another eigai'ette, .lat-k eontiniied.
“in late .\l:ireli or early ,\pril, lilttl, (‘ziptain

attempt tailed lttll there ‘.\'i'l'i‘ three or four

Vientiane and moved east and finally north
into the Plaine des Jarres that they con-
trolled.”

Stopping to take another sip of coffee Jack
continued by saying that Cong Lee seemed
like he wanted to do the right thing but didn’t
know how to do it. Eventually he was forced
into joining the Pathet Lao. After the coup
failed, the only sanctuary was the Pathet Lao.
Cong did initiate some movement against
Royal troops, but the attempt was half-
he a r to d.

(‘ong seemed unsure that he was doing the
right thing. At times, he was fightingagainst
both sides. (“ong lee commanded the elite
troops (airhorne). They were pretty good
fighters in eomparison to the other Lao
troops.

State Student

Jaek Savage, now a State sophomore, spent
a year with the Army Special Forces in Laos.
.laek also spent several months in South \’iet
Nani when the Diem regime was in control.

“.\nother lttg prohlem with the Lao troops
was that they didn’t eonsider that they were
in ill? army,” .laek went on. “They felt that
they were only work for the army. The
standard of living is so lowthat the Lao could
make more money in the ariiiv than anywhori
else.
