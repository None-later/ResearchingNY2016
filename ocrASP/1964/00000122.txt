Eliinwood Receives Gront-in-Aid:
Interest lies in English History

by Lorraine Bernackl

Editor's Note: This series of
articles attempts to give the Uni-
versity community an idea of the
research currently being under-
taken by our faculty. Recently,
several of the faculty received
grants tram The Research Founda-
tion of the State University of New
York.

DeWitt C. Eliinwood, Associate
Professor of History, was awarded
a grant-in-aid, one of two types of
awards given.

The other is a summer research
fellowship, which finances scholar-
ship being done in a given summer,
while the grant-in-aid can be used
to finance research expenses over
a two year period.

  

Dr. DeWitt Eliinwood

Eliinwood has long maintained an
interest irt England and, more par-
ticularly, her role as an itnperial
power. As a recipient of the grant-

in aid, he will make a “Study of tlte
Changing Concepts of Empire and
Commonwealth from 1905 to 1920.”

 

While working on his Ph. D. at
Washington University in St. Louis,
Missouri, Eliinwood became inter-
ested in the Round Table Move-
ment.

This political group had its be-
ginnings in 1909, during the recon—
struction of South Africa after the

Boer War. Consisting of young
Oxford graduates, it was known in
South Africa as the Closer Union
Movement.

A key idea of its political policy
was to apply the satne kind of unity
to the British Empire as a whole
while maintaining self-government
in each partlctilar community.

Seeking a true ParliamentofEm-
pire, they became known as the
Round Table Movement in their
stress upon the role of representa—
tive government.

Achieve Goals
While never a predominant factor
in, British political life, the Round
Table Movement did achieve sig-
nificant goals as it increased its
concern for other members of the
Commonwealth.

Though at first interestedin white
dominiorts, by 1915 it had begun
lookirtg toward India.

Several Round Table groups were
begun there; though not native, the
movement did have fairly extensive
contact with the Indians.

The Round Table Movement made
a significant gain iti 1919 with the
passage of the India Act, which ent-
bodies much of whatit had advocated

concerning self— government.

Papularize "Commonwealth"

Through the efforts of the Round
Table Movement, the term "corn-
monwealtit” was popularized. The
“father figure of the group,” ac-
cording to Ellinwaod, was Lord
Milrier, because he organized it in
South Africa.

Also notable was Lionel Curtis,
known as “The Prophet” for his
vociferous fight for Round Table
ideals.

Eliinwood itas been working on
tltis aspect of Commonwealth re-
lations for sortie time.

Despite a recertt tendency of his-
torical scholarship to overlook the
empire, he recognizes the signifi—
cartce of studylngBritain’s relation—
ship to non—European peoples, es-
pecially those of India.

Research in England
ilis studies took him to England
last summer, where he worked pri—
tnarily at the offices of The Round
Table quarterly review, a publica—
tiott still in existence.

There, EllinWood examined the
private papers of Lionel Curtis.
This cotiiirig summer, he is teach—
ing durittg the six-week session,
but plans to visit various Canadian
libraries lll search of material.

Eventually, much of Eilinvtood’s
research will find its way to pub—
lication, either as a number of
magazine articles, or possibly in
book form,

Students Attend
Examining ‘lensions in the City’

Clifford Rugg ’65 and Arthur Ferrari ’66 attended
Long Island University’s second Intercollegiate Con-
ference on Urban Affairs, “Tensions in the City,” on

March 6, 7, and 8.

 

llll Conference

The conference was held at the

Zeckendorf Campus in Brooklyn, New York.
The two students were invitedby Dr. Paul F. Wheeler,

Associate Professor ofSo-
ciology, to attend the con-
ference. They acted as
representatives of the So—
ciology Department. Funds
to send the students were
allocated by the University.

The conference consisted of a
walking tour of several institutions
in Brooklyn, speakers. and work-
shops.

Participating students considered
the role of the University iii solving
the problems that result froitt the
current massive trend of urbaniza-
tioti.

The University is suffering from
growing pains, btit State’s are not
nearly as severe as those in urban
areas. The people at the conference
felt that the universuy’s rolc irt
deciding the future of the urban ex-
perience had to be made obvious.

Role of University

The main question in pottii was,
does the university have a respon—
sibility in tirbun affairs? That is
to say, what, if any. is the role of
the university in meeting the prob—
lems of the contirmally changing
urban community'.’

The conference reached several
conclusions on the problem. First,
the university is both a partner
arid a neighbor to the urban colit-
munity.

It offers the unique opportunity
of developing a well-ordered sys-

tetn that will be helpftil iii anal—
yzing and solving sortie of the prob-
lettts peculiar to urban areas.

The university also trains the
people who will cope with the prob-
lems of urban conditions as they
arise. It will play a major role lll
providing research opportunities
necessary for the analysts of social
problems arid social change itsclf.

The stipposition is that research
prccedes action. The university pro—
vides a unique place for thedevelop—
triettt of ordered arid integrated
methods of coping \l‘llll urban prob—
lems. Before action can bc taketi,
research is needed, and this is the
task that falls on the shoulders of
the University.

Changing Problems

The problems to bc faccd are
numerous and they lll’l' Lll\‘.'lll\
changing.

The problems ofur‘bimexpci tcticc
arc political as well as social, er-o-
itotiiic as well as architectural, mid
administrative uswr-ll aspsycholog-
tcul. To solve those problems a
well-plumicd program on the titti-
y'ersity level is needed.

The basic poiiit to be mattc in
planning for the future of the uni-
vr-rsity lit urban affairs is the need
for a well-ordered, directed, arid
integrated program.

Since tlrbatt problems are always
changing, the nature of change must
be understood and adaptation to this
cliangc will help moot tbc ever—
prosent challenge.

To the Editor:

There has been a lot of talk re-
cently about the role of sororities
and fraternities on the new campus.
Coupled with this has been the ques—
tion of whether or not sororities and
fraternities will be allowed to func—
tion iii the future.

In the past year many new steps
have beert taken by the administra—
tion iii art attempt to evaluate these
organizations. Sororities and fra—
ternities are now requtr‘ed to hand

at‘adcmics, contributions to the
community, culturc. finances, and
functions.

Safe One-Party Districts
Weaken Political System

by Joseph W. Gnlu

That New York’s delegation to
Congress is dominated by men of
less exceptional ability is accepted
by ittost people who study politics.
The sarrte is trite with regard to
the men ill the legislature.

Very oftett the men nominated by
the party are tltose who offer the
least probability of defyiugthe party
bosses. Often they aremen wlto have
purchased the party nomination
either in cash or in past favors to a
boss.

The reason this is possible is the
greatest scourge of the American
political system—the safcone-party
district. When the Republican party
set up the new congrcsstonai dis-
tricts, they believed they nan drawn
225 safe Republican districts aitd lo‘
safe Deiriocratic districts.

Surprises

The 1962 clectioits showed that
the Republicans hurl undcr-csti—
mated the mic getting abilities of
Hugh Cart-y, Otis l’tkc, Sam Strat—
ton, and John Murphy. The lineup
iii the House dclcgatiou is 21 Re-
pulltcar to 20 Democrats despite
the gert .mandt-r ing.

The attempt to set tip all safe
districts is a deal botwecn the
bosses of the two parties. Neither
party iit New York appcarstodesirc
districts mwliichonly anexccptional
candidate could win.

()ill\' a good or (l‘xt‘t‘llilttll'tll candi—
date can wm in a district whcrt- thc
parties arc of neur equal strength,

If it werc possible foralldtstricts
to be Willltilll dominance by a siriglc
party, it Would create more interest
In politics, a btghcr leyel ofserytce
by the men elccted, and a better
political systcin.

The current split in the Republi—
can party between the. old stand-pat

group and the new liberals and the
new conservatives is creatingagood
deal of unrest irt litany districts.

Several old party-men are retir—
irtg. Their retirements have set off
lively primary fights lit several dis-
tricts. The most active arid most
bitter is for the seat held by Clar-
ence Killiurn. The cottrtties are
Franklin, St. Lawrence, Oswego,
Lewis, and Jefferson.

Both State Senators froin the area
are iii the running as well as at
least three other men. The result
is a Wide party split between on the
one hand men with long records of
service and on the other men with
ability and u desire to serye.

Situation Not Uncommon

A similar situation is shaping tip
lil western New York where (Jon-
grt-ssmun William Milleraimouuced
hc \vould rcttrc. Milli-r is froin
Niagara county. This nit-ans that it
is iirit- county’s tttrn to have the
congrcssmau. (Niagara will be re—
paid with a ptdgr- or something else
handy.)

So fur two Republicans on tho
iluffalo city council, four men front
Nortlt 'l‘onawunda, and twomen frotit
Niagara County are running. This
form of chaos together yvtthMiller’s
owryvlicliutng u. popularity has
thrown the race widt- open and en—
dangercd the Republican strangle-
hold on the district.

Similar sittmtionshuyc bcencr'op—
ping up 111 other congressional dis—
tricts. scycral senatorial districts,
and many assembly districts. The
\y'holc picturc taken together indi-
mics rather clcitrly that the Repub—
licun party is ill danger.

It is only a series of internal
splits such as are now appearing
and the very likely prospect of a
Democratic landslide in November,
that can topple the New York GOP’s
liking of mild coiitpc't-nts.

Concern for intellectuolistn Good

by Cynthi’a Goodman

“You just can’t make like a school that has an in-
tellectual atmosphere,” says Mr. Harry C. Staley,
A man of positive
ideas arid natural exuberance, lte leans forward to

emphasize his poittt.

In a sense, lie explains, each student creates his own
intellectual stimulus arid is responsible for tlie creation
of art intellectual atmosphere on a college campus. lie

ism’ means ‘sper:ialization‘.”

There is, he feels, not

enough importance placed on the old Greek concept of

‘paideia.’

The Greeks emphasized the need for an in-
dividual to understand and appreciate all the aspects
of ills own culture.

Staley, himself, has tried to avoid specialization.
Although currently doing his doctoral thesis on Joyce,

he has taught such varied subjects as Chaucer, phil-

ology, ntoderu

criticizes the students failure to take advantage of the

numerous cultural activities offered by the city of

Albany.

“The prevailing attitude,” he complains, “seems to
be that ‘there can’t be any art in Albany.’ ”

Mr. Staley, who has beeit teaching at this university
since 1956, has had aittpleopportunity toobserve cttltttral
activity on other campuses. liaving douehisttndergrad—
uate work at both the University oflirianchcster, England,
and St. John’s Coflegc ill Brooklyn, he obtained his
master’s degree at the University of Pennsylvania.
Before accepting a position at State, lie was teaching at

Loyola College.

In examining the complaints against the so—callcd
here, Mr.
sentiment “Wonderful” and feels that the fact that so
many students are concerned \vould indicate the ex-
istencc of some mlellcctualism on this campus.

toward specialization iii education. A firm believer iit

allow Rockwell to speak on campus
was speedily approved...”

Essentially, the university’s pol-
icy is to permit any speaker to ap—
pear if he is invited by a recognized
campus group unless it can be shown
that there is no educational value irt
allowing him to speak. The burden
of proof is upon those who oppose
the speaker.

editorial:

“This willingness to explore the
whole spectrum of political thought
iii no way implied, sympathy with
