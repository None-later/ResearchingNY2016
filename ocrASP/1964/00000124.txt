Surely there is no doubt that
Stanley Kubrick is one of today’s
most original film directors.

This originality lies not in his
competent but undistinguished visual
style, but in his ability to direct
actors and develop plots on several
levels.

His last film, Lolita. was adver-
tised as a tragic love story about a
pathetically warped human being,
and this is how the film appeared
on the surface.

But Kubrick managed, through
the actors. and his presentation of
the scenes, to make it also a satire
on literary and filinic cliches.

Dr. Strangelove

Now, his Dr. Strangelove: or How
I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love
the Bomb, is being presented as a
wildly hilarious satire on humanity
and government. This it is, but it
also may be the most serious pes—
sitnistic comedy yet tnade, for be-
hind it lie sotne fearful ideas.

The things it makes funny, such
as mental and physical cripples
and seif—annihiliation, are really
quite terrifying. The question may
arise whether these things should
be funny; nonetheless, in this case,
they unarguably are.

The satire so often passes into
burlesque that the film at times
becomes definitely farcical. It is
also quite a suspenseful thriller,
particularly in the later scenes
aboard Major King Kong’s bolnber.

There are three major scenes
of action - the bomber, Burpelson
Air Force Base, the Pentagon War
Room - and their details all seem
realistically reproduced.

The other scenes, linking these
three, are often awkward, and the
transitions between them are abrupt.
Indeed, the entire film seems to
have been hastily edited together.

The attack on the A. F. Base
presents an ironic sign (“Peace
is our Profession”) to the point
of redundancy, and a bobbing, weav-
ing hand-held camera is used ex-
cessively.

Slow Pace
The film’s pace is a bit slow in
developing, and most of .he scenes
in the bomber are sufficiently
straight that they contribute little
to the comedy, btlt much the sus—
pense.

Sliln Pickens as the Texas pilot,
a role that Peter Sellers was to
have played, is an average—sol...er-
type whose mind falls to grasp the
consequences of what is happen-
llig, and so assures his crew they’ll
all be ill line for promotion “after
this thing is over.”

At the base, Sterling ilayden
makes Gen. Jack D. Ripper’s theo-
ries on fluoridation and otlr natural
bodily fluid funny, by iiol portray-
ing him as an utter maniac. He
clearly believes in what he ltas
done — he has ordered a squadron
to attack Russia.

Peter Sellers plays Lionel Man—
drake, a nervous British officer

call code from the General.

War Room Tops

The scenes at the base are good,
but those in the War Rootn surpass
them. Hilarious are the clashes
between the inert President (Sellers)
and the childisiily irresponsible Gen.
“Buck” Turgidson (George C.
Scott).

By now the plans, put into opera—
tion through a failure of “the human
element” (Ripper), have become so
entangled in the safeguards built
into our nuclear deterrents that the
planes cannot be recalled.

Russia, too, is hopelessly en—
tangled in the barbed—Wire of safety
with its Doomsday Machine set to
explode automatically if the country
is bombed.

Also at the conference is Dr.
Strangelove (Sellers), a “coil—
verted” German scientist who calls
the President “Mein Feuhrer” and
is almost strangled by his own
mechanical hand.

Sellers Excellent

Pickens is adequate and Hayden
surprisingly good, and botll play
their roles fairly straight. Sellers
is cx'cellcnt iii three very different
characters, fol he is a genius at
piayitig a role straight willie re-
taining its coliiic aspects.

Except for Sellers‘ brilliantly,
chillingly, hilarious por'rait of
Strangeloye. however, George C.
Scott ‘Vlii have to be credited with
stealing the show. His style is
broad, and he is ill constant lilo-
tion, facialiy and/or bodily.

"Brilliant" Picture

it also nlay be thought that the
unusual mixture of suspense, pes-
simism and comedy weakens the
film. [it reality, it gives it tnore
stature by making it more than
just a “comedy.” Like Lolita,
it cannot be classified other than
in the uncertain category of“bril—
liant.”

Sclsam Book Excellent Introduction

To Marxist Philosophy, History

by Alex Delfini

Howard Selsam has two major
points to make in his Marxist ori—
ented book, What is Philosophy.
First, he claims that philosophy,
rather than being a disinterested
quest for truth, is usually, lll ef-
fect, a defense of tortuln social
and economic ideals of a specific
portion of a society. Second, Sei-
sam contends that Marxism lSllf’t‘S—
entiy the most advanced and walls--
tic expression of the aspirations of
the majoiity of mankind.

The first position taken by Selsulu
is that philosophy is ideology. Sel-
sam bellcyes that all philosophical
movements 1 an be traced to ccitaln

Salvatore Casein in Presentation
Shows Painter’s llistinnt Mnntls

by Karen Goldstein

I would greatly suggest the Salvatore Cascio show,
currently at the Albany Institute of History and Art,
to anyone wishing to examine what seems to be the work

of two distinct painters.

Upon reviewing the show, I felt my moods and im-
pressions rotate from muted, “mud-luscious,” almost

traditional water colors to
vibrant, striking, abstract

oils and back to the former.

The viewer must possess a sense
of visual schiyoplirenia in order
to draw any conclusions regarding
Casclo’s single style or lack of ally.

Traditional Subiect Matter
Most representative of the tra-
ditional subject-mutter water color
are “Maine Coast," “Province-
town," and “Maine liarbor.”

Cast-to appears to be preoccupied
Witii bits of John Marin’s broad
brush stroke technique, ills unfin—
ished canvas corners. and his ap-
petite for blues and browns. as
shown ill the aboye-tnentioned palnt-
ings.

Cascio’s approach to the popular
and sccllic New England coastline
is refreshing because he manages
to keep the viewer’s eyes shifting
over many centers of interest. iiis
dramatic rendering of “Province-
town” placed me inside the oil-
rushing storln cloitd. This intense
serenity before the storm was very
cleverly created with fierce blues
antl blacks.

Contrasts in Rhythm

’I‘Wo paintings, “Globe Theatre,"
and “ Piazza.” remained inmymind
as horrifying examples of poorly—
colored photographs front a Chain—
ber of Commerce circular. "Globe
Theatre” appears to be Times
Square as seen through the bleary
eyes of a veteran of its streets.
It lacks the rhythm and excitement
this area usually echoes.

If “Piazza” had a Santa Claus
driving a sled across its lnurky
sky, this Would yield a typical holi—
day-season greeting card.

 

 

“Kathleen's Bedroom” over—
powered the previous two without
much difficulty. Slightly remi-
niscent of Andrew Wyeth’s return
to reality paintings, “Kathleen’s
Bedroom” had a mystical stillness
abotll it. The soft rhythms of the
furniture and draperies fortned a
very pleastug effect. The open Win—
dow left the viewer desiring to seo
more of this type of painting.

Little Imagination

'l‘he blaring use of bright colors
and a poor interpretation of Kline’s
Japanese-miluenced black stroke
characterizes much of Cast-lo’s ub-
stl'acts. Outside of his very effi-
cient utilization of u shocking pal—
ette, Cast-lo has not been \ery
imaginative.

General disappointment was the
end result of y'iewmg some of his
abstracts and was confirmed after
seeing the overpriced and mor-
sized “Adirondack Region.”

The use of color to prodth in—
lercst is undoubtedly the highlight
of the painting, eyeu thoughtt seems
to toiiSisi of incollnccled sections.

“Sundial” was a welcome relief
after “Adirondack Region.” Its
soothing and ttttlted, bllt notlifelcss,
oranges anti browns, coupled With
the natural rhythm of tile sun’srays
yielded one of the best of the “ab-
stract Sal Cascto.”

The show cannot be judged in its
entirety because of the oppostng
natures of its content. Each side
of the two Cascios has some nia-
tei'ial that is well-rendered; lilese
paitttings could easily be filtered
otlt for exlnbitloll on a small wall
and still have enough space for a
window.

The show continues through April

To Discuss University Government

“New Perspective for the Future,” State’s recent

President, Dr. Evan R. Collins.

devoted to the discussion and analysis of the function

i and philosophy of Univer-
} sity student government.
' The assemblage of a1-
‘ most fifty students, faculty,
and administration, sacri-
flctqg four days of the spring recess,
cc vened Thursday, April 2, with

Thursday-Proparatlon

Thursday, following a banquet and
an initial address by the University
Dean of Students, Dr. David Hartley,
the conference delegates spent the
evening reading and preparing for
the two days of discussion ahead.

"Dialogue" Necessary

“Each of us,” he stated, “per-,
sottnei deans, faculty members, and
student leaders, must help our stu-
dents achieve an optimum balance
between authority on the one hand
and freedom on the other.”

He felt that in a growing Util-
versity there must be a decentral-
ization of authority to insure a
spreading of responsibility and de-
cision making. In later discussion
he again re-cmphasized that there
must be a constant “dialogue” be-
tween student, facility, and admin-
istration.

One and one-half days later, fol—
lowing several sessions of dis-
cussion, feedback, both ill small
groups and general assembly, the
delegates me‘ in a final session
to draw together all that had been
accomplished.

President Summarizes

Here they were addressed by
University President, Dr. Evan it.
Collins, Wllo delivered a suttilnal'y
statement, based upon what he had
observed during the three day as-
seinhly.

lie felt that the group had been
very well directed ill “clarifying
its present thinking before project-
lng too far into the future," and
emphasized three points.

“The University is indeed acum-
munity" implying a need for com-
munication and interdependency,
“the university has acomniongoal"
iii the search for knowledge and
truth through free inquiry, and that
this community is "unique and dis-
tinct."

ile concluded by urging that the
conference make definite plans for
the future development of the ideas
and ideals set down at this confer-
ence, and that students, faculty, and
administration strive to bring about
greater communication Within this
university community. .

 

APRIL 10. 1964

Arthur Ferrari ’66,

Commissioner of Finance,

announced Sunday radically
revised procedures for
compiling Student Associa—
tion’s 1964—65 budget.
These changes are in ac—
cordance with the Budget
Procedures Bill passed by

Senate last Semester.

Presidents and treasurers of all
budgetary organizations lnust meet
with the commissioners of Cabinet
tomorrow as the first step in im-
plementing the new procedures.

The meetings will begin at 1:00
p.m. in Brubacher Hall. At that
time a complete outline of the new
procedures will be presented to the
heads of the budgetary organiza—
tions.

All organizations will be required
to turn in tentative budgets to the
individual Cabinet Commissioners
next Saturday, April 18.

Legislative Function

Student Association's budget in
the past has always first gone
through Finance Committee in a
catch-can as catch-can manner.
This was in spite of the fact that the
SA Constitution charges the Execu-
tive with compiling and presentinga
budget to Senate every year.

In the words of SA President Ar-
thur Johnston, “These new proce-
dures should make budgeting a lot
smoother. It’s about timetheexecu-
tive branch followed the constitution
and presented a budget to Senate.
Having the budget compiled by F1-
nance Committee iii the past was
ridiculous.”

Classifications

executive through the arm of Cab-
inet.

All organizations have been di-
vided into one of the four classifi-
cation of Communications, Culture,
Recreation, and Government. The
Cabinet Commissioners iii each of
these four fields will be responsible
for initially compiling budgets of
organizations under their jurisdic-
tion.

Marilyn Brown ’66 is Commis-
sioner of Culture and William Bate
’66 is Commissioner of Recreation.
No appointments have beenmade for
Communications or Government.

At tomorrow’s meeting the Com-
missioners will outline thenewpro-
cedures. Next Saturday all organi-
zations will have to submitproposed
budgets to the Commissioners.

Tentative Ceilings

Tentative ceilings will be placed
Oil each of the classifications prior
to this meeting. These ceilings will
be based on an estimation of next
year’s Student Tax.

The tentative Student Tax figure
in turn will be based on projected
enrollment, on last year’s budget
(and additional appropriations), and
pr0jected figures for the coming
fiscal year.

These figures will be formulated
today in a meeting between Ferrari
and Dr. David Hartley, Dean of
Students.

At next Saturday’s meeting the
president and treasurer of each
group will supply copies of their
proposed budget totlie Cabinet Com-
tnissioner and the representatives
of the other organizations in the
classification.

Each budget Will be discussed
and voted oti separately. Each
person in attendance, including the
members of the individual groups,
will have one vote.

The total of the budgets will not

be allowed to exceed the tentative
ceiling for that classification.

Senate Approval

After passed on the Cabinet level,
the budgets will then be reviewed
by Ferrari, Johnston, and SA Vice
President Al Smith before being
presented for Senate’s considera-
tion.

Budget Comtnittee, a sub-com-
mittee of Finance Committee, will
begin conducting open hearings on
the budget by April 22. Hearings
will hopefully be completed in a
two week period so that the final
budget can be submitted for Senate’s
approval on either May 6 or 13.

Final vote in Senate will be by
budget classification. Defeat of one
classification will, in effect, defeat
the Whole budget. “It is strongly
