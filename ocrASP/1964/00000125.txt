to combat tbievary.

Lockers have recently been in-

College Bookstore in an effort to
reduce the small amount ofpilfering
which now occurs in the facility.

According to Robert Bell, Man-
ager of the Bookstore, about three
thousand dollars in merchandise
is stolen annually. This is approxi-

know what they are doing.

Mr. Bell said that the lockers
are better appearingthan the wooden
rack which was used for several
months.

Also, he said that he hopes the
