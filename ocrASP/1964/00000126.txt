University linin

“An opportunity for sharing ideas and ideals — A
New Perspective for the Futnre.” This statement
served as theme for the recently concluded Student
Government Conference here at State, and it may have
made a point of signiﬁcance to the entire University.

The result of much labor and excellent planningby
a student-faculty steering committee, the conference
focused its collective attention to the formulation of
a philosophy of student government — its function and
purpose. However, the ideas andattitudes which evolved
out of this three-day assemblage transcend student gov-
ernment and, in fact, are of vital import to the entire
University community.

The tone was set when Dr. Butler, Dean of Students
at Ohio University and guest authoritytothe conference,
stated in his keynote address that “there must be a
constant exchange of ideas and opinions, a dialogue,
among students, faculty, and administration; the whole
University community.”

This “dialogue” remained a integral part of the
conference, both in word and in practice, and after
three days of discussion were past, the 32 students and
15 faculty delegates seemed dedicated to its contin-
uance. Never, in recent years, had such a thing been
tried; never had so much been accomplished in the
realm of infra-university communication.

President Collins, in his summary address, pointed
out that we are indeed a “distinct and unique commun—
ity” dedicated to a common goal — “the search for
knowledge and truth through free inquiry;” an inquiry
that demands clear communication.

It seems, then, rather pointless that such a commun-
ity, where free’ channels for individual expression are
so vital, should build walls among its various constitu-
ent parts. We are seemingly a community divided against
itself. All are striving to attain the same peak via dif-
ferent sides of the mountain.

Why is there this lack of faith and cooperation?
Don’t the students realize that the faculty have also
been students, that they are sympathetic to student
causes, and that they are dedicated to our complete
education? Don’t the faculty remember their student
days when they demanded so strongly the right to be
heard and have a voice in what was to affect them?

Are we not missing a valuable source of knowledge
and information? Cannot the experience and know-how
of the faculty and administration help enrich the ac-
tivities of the student body, and cannot the students
offer a vital source of current opinion and thought to
those who are in the position to make decisions which
will effect the entire university?

Dr. Butler mentioned that the President of Ohio had
appointed 50 students to standinguniversity committees
and that each activity or group had at least two faculty
members who served as sources of information, ex-
perienced advisors, and helped provide “continuity in
a trailsin DOPUIatiOTb” It has proven itself to
be of great advantage.

The university community as a whole might well
direct itself to two stated assumptions of this recent
conference: “there must be a broadening of attitudes
as a part of a creative change,” and “each person
must strive to promote free communication among all
members of our university community.”

Housing Procedures lair

We commend the Student Personnel Office on the
procedure it has set up for choosing residence for the
next year. While we foresee the inevitable and inter-
minable lines, we feel that the method offers the fairest
possible chance to each student to live where and with
whom he desires.

The procedure also takes a great deal of work away
from the administrative offices and places the task
of making arrangements on the students. This is as it
should be in a University increasing as rapidly in
size as ours now is.

Under this method students will know immediately
what dorm, room, and roommates they will have for
the next semester. They will no longer have to ,wait for
weeks while the Housing Office sorts out and matches
up the preferences of some 2,000 students.

We are somewhat disturbed with the provisions gov-
erning off-campus housing. We had understood that
those persons now off-campus would be allowed to re-
main ofl‘—campus. However, the policy seems to imply
that a limited number of off-campus accommodations
will be given on the same number basis. We hope the
confusion will be cleared up in the near future. and we
trust that the University will hold to its original
promise.

staff, I have a definite interest in

program.

the pariies concerned, that the writ-
e: of ;. our editorial and Mr. Luczak
.'.a'-e been carrying on this personal
vendetta for quite some time. There-
fore we can dismiss your writer‘s
“ :norz’ " as an instance where
your writer not only wore lllS “im-
mailif‘ll} ...on ms sleeve,” but all

I have no iacuonal or fraternal

duty as a member oflhat community
to put Senate’s“dlrtylinen” through
the wringer.

This I shall continue to do; not-
withstanding, tbe outcries of those
who would have me stop. The only
“tripe” or god-head complexes in
this matter, I leave as the soul-
searciiing concern oflbose whotblnk
that Senate is above and beyond the
reach of the “little man.”

To the Editor:

It would seem to me that the
editors of the ASP ought to re-
train from accusing others of ir-
responsible editorialiring.

Nicholas Argyros
Station Manager, WSUA

To the Editor:

With regard to your editorial
of March 20, 1964 concerning Senate
Close-Up! (Thursdays; 10:30 p.m.):
the publicity was most appreciated —
the assininity of the remarks was
not.

Student Suggests Plan For

To the Editor:

Recently, after seeing the re-
sponse to the second annual book
contest sponsored by the State Co-
op, I thought of another contest
that could be sponsored by the
(Lo-op, or perhaps more appropri-
ately, by WSUA ortheMuslc Council
and the faculty of the Music depart-
ment. This contest Would be a‘ltec-
0le Collection’ contest.

I have discussed this williseveral
friends, and they have all agreed
With me that some organization

of the S.U.N.Y.A. Callile ill'l
sponsor such a contest

This is how I would ham 2' ::::.,

Special Schenectady School Trains

Retarded Children for Place in life

by Steve Curti

As part of their program
for this year, Kappa Delta
Epsilon gave a St. Patrick’s
Day party on March 21 for
students at a school forthe

mentally retarded.

Route seven in Schenectady is the
location of the school, which is
headed by Mr. Walter Schofield. Mr.
Schofield spoke at a meeting of
Kappa Delta Epsilon, the women’s
education Honorary, and told the
members about the purpose and work
for the retarded being carried on at
his school.

Fifty Pupils

Fifty pupils ranging in age from
five to ten years attend this school.
As they come to class each day,
everyone of them is required to drop
a slat with his name into a gaily
colored box.

This box is similar to a time
clock, for many of them may be

IhaAmeLicmLEamm

lucky enough to enter the everyday
world someday.

All these pupils are retarded and
will never be able to advance beyond
the mental age of seven years. In
the various classifications made for
the mentally retarded, these stu—
dents are listed as educables and
trainables. Most of them possess
I.Q.’s of 50 ‘and below.

Vital Function

Because the public school system
will not accept pupils with I.Q.’s
below 50, schools such as Mr.
Schofield’s must exist to provide
an opportunity for these children
to make some use of themselves
to society.

Mr. Sciiofiell gave an idea of
the size of ti.- school by saying
that there all: four teachers for

the four grade levels. The five to
ten year ol'ls go to school for half
a day. There is one class for 10-15
year olds, and two classes for stu-
dents who are over 16.

To accomplish their goals, the
teachers help the children to learn
simple necessities; to memorize

Brazil Revolt Benefits

Anti-Red Carlos Lacerda

by J. R. Lee

The recent change in the Brazilian
government has been especially
beneficial to Carlos Lacerda who is,
perhaps, the mosloutspoken Brazil-
Ian anti-communist.

Lacerda, the Governor of the
state of Guanabara and arch—foe of

' deposed President
Joao Goulart bashad
an interesting life
in Brazilian poll-
tics.
GOVel‘llOl‘ Lacerda,
the prodigious son
of a Socialist dep—
uty, began his car-
eer as a communist
journalist. In the late 1930’s he
made a name as a result of his at-
tacks on the regime of President
Getulio Vargas.
Vargas

In 1939 be broke Willi the C(llll-
munisl party which be has vigor-
ously opposed everslnce. In 1945,
the scum year that Elll‘lco Duli'a
was elected president of Brazil,
Lacerda entered politics and was
elected (tlly ('Ollllt'llUI' in lilo dc
Junelro and Ill 1948 be started his
own newspaper, "The Tribune of
the Press."

When, in 1051, Vargas. was re-
elected pl‘esuleul, Laccrdu slui'lml
an intensive newspaper and lulu—
Vltilml callipuig‘u against lllH admin—
lati'ullon. 'l‘lus attack was so (alloc—
llvc that :m zitieiupl was made on
l4ilt'el'llll‘5 life. Inucol'du was
wounded in lllu ullzu-k and his com—
panion was killed.

When one of Vargasl bmlyg‘uul'ds
confessed to the illihllh‘ﬁllltilltlll, and
when subsequent evulonco ol wido—
spruud governmental (‘Ul'l upllon was
presumed to Vargas, be called an
evening cabinet “looting, donouncml
his adjutanis, resigned his (illlcu,
and couuulilod suicide.

During the presidencyofJuscolmo
Kubltscliek, Laccnla served in the
Federal Congress as the leader of
his party, the National Democratic
Union. He became Governor of Guan-
abnra in 1060.

Quadros

In that same year, Jaulo Quadros
was elected President on a reform
ticket. Political peace reigned be—
tween Qllﬂtll’llb' and Lucerda until ll
became apparent that Quadi'os bad
no el’l‘ectlve program and was lllQl'tlly

 

aggrandizing power for himself.

Lacerda arranged for a meeting
with Quadros in the capital city of
Brazilia to see if there was any
basis for continuing the political
amin between them. Quadros re—
ceived him cordially but avoided
any meaningful discussion of po—
lillcal issues.

On an August 26, 1901 television
show, Lacerda told of his meeting
with Quadros and said, “The man
we elected doesn’t want to be Pres-
ident, he wants to be dictator.” On
August 27, 1961, Quudros resigned.
Lucei‘da’s relations with Quadros
successor, the Just deposed Pres-
ident Joao Goulari, were no less
stormy.

boulort

While only specific confrontations
between these two men, such as
the clashes over the recognition of
the U.S.S.lt. and the Cuban Solidar-
ity Conference have been mentioned
in the World press, these clashes
were only lllt‘ldelllal [manifestations

of a (‘illlllll'l that was general in
scope.
In lllh‘ struggle with Luccrdu,

Goului'l resorted lo an unsucrcssful
appeal lo the Cough-SS to declare
at “slate of siege” which, had con—
gress approved, Would have greatly
expanded Goulul'l’s powers zuulsus-

[)l‘UVtil ol the coup while if was still

marched Into ltlu.

Lacei'du, who already has the on-
doi'scmeui ol the National l)omo~
cratic Union as its presidential
candidate, is the best known of
Guulul'l's political opponents.

telephone numbers and street ad-
dresses, to lace and tie their shoes,
to respect authority, to recognize
names, and to follow directions.

Croft Actlvltles

Several activities aim at a desire
to improve hand and eye coordina-
tion, an essential part of learning
skills. Making clothes brushes, tote
bags, and rugs often help to pro-
mote thls coordination. Many of
these are sold at a profit to help
support the school.

Mr. Schofleld went on to say that
many of the children, especially
the older ones, realize that there
is something “different” about
them. As a result they try to act
more like “normal” people. These
children are often rejected at home
and seem to have almost an animal
instinct concerning the way aper-
son feels about them.

Music Appeals

Music seems to appeal to them
and is most successful in reaching
them. Nearly all of these students-—
even those that have no verbal
language at all ~ can pick out a
rhythm. It is very difficult to hold
their attention to anything besides
music for a long span of time.

Many teachers feel that the key
to the education of these children
is repetition. Working with these
“ageless” children is perhaps more
rewarding than with normal stu—
dents, said Mr. Schoi‘ield.

They are both loveable and chal-
lenging. When they learn something,
the teacher is afforded a real sense
of accomplishment.

Quallfled Teacher Rare
Not everyone would be qualified
to teach them, though. In Mr. Scho-
l’ield’s words, “being able to relate
to children, and these children in
particular is really a gift.”
