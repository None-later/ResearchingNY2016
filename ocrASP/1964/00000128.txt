llepciicai Prospects Seem llirnmer
In lIext fall’s State Elections

by Joseph W. Galu

The position of the New York
State Republican party in this No-
vember’s general election is not
a strong one.

Despite the fact that the GOP
controls both houses of the state
legislature, the congressional dele-
gation, the governorship, and both
federal senatorships, many indica-
tions show a rising tide in lawn
of the Democrats.

The Republicans are faced with
declining enrollment, the rise of
the Conservative party, the unpopu-
larity of Gov. Rockefeller's pro-
gram, and increased Democratic
strength on Long Island and in up-
state New York.

Margins Are Now Slim

While the Republicans control both
the State Senate and the Assembly,
their margins have been reduced
markedly. Democrats have picked
up seats in Erie County and the
boroughs of the Bronx and Queens.

Democrats also have picked up a
Senate seat in Schenectady and Scho-
harie counties and one assembly
seat in each of Oneida, Monroe, and
Cayuga counties.

The Conservative party is a ser-
ious threat to the Republican party.
It has been mistakenly dismiésed by
many people as being nothing more
than an expression of anti-Rocke-
feller feeling.

In the 1962 general elections the
Conservatives became a legal party
by obtaining 50,000 votes for their
gubernatorial candidate. Their can-
didate, Jaquith, easily exceeded the
requirement in polling more than
140,000 votes.

In 1963 the Conservatives ran
candidates in four of the five bor-
oughs of New York City. These
four candidates received a greater
vote than did Jaquith in the city,
despite a smaller turn out of voters.

The significance of this Conser-
vative vote has been ignored by
most politicians and most news-
papers.

Elections Sign of Party Loyalty
The elections have members of the
State Court of Appeals, the highest

court in the state, have indicated the
rising tide within the Democratic

party.

In 1962 the Democratic candidate
for the court was elected but only
by having the votes of both the
Democratic and Liberal parties. In
1963 the candidate put up by the
Democrats was endorsed by the
Republicans and the Liberals.

Thus Francis Bergen was elected
With the support of three major
parties.

Bergen polled more votes as a
Democrat than he did as a Repub-
lican. This means that Bergen ran
about 300,000 votes better than did
Kennedy when he ran in 1960.

Rocky's In‘lluence

Rockefeller will not be on the
Republican ticket this year, unless
he obtains the Presidental nomina-
tion. Rockefeller, while he has been
able to obtain the votes of many in-
dependently liberal Democrats in
New York City, is not popular in
upstate New York.

His divorce hurt him with many
voters; his remarriage hurt him
with many more. His willingness to
spend his time outside New York
State has not endeared him with the
voters who are generally dissatis-
fied.

Rockefeller's program has been
watered down in the last two years
due to the tightness of his budget.
He has attempted to increase tax
dollars by creating independent
agencies which borrow monies
which are not considered debts of
the state.

He has also attempted to maintain
his “pay-as—you-go” method by

abandoning many parts of his pro- I

gram.

He failed to obtain any effective
reform of the liquor laws, he let
die the proposal to repeal the state’s
antiquated full-crew law, and he
appears to be accepting large parts
of watered down conflict of interest
statute.

Faced with these problems and
the prospect of New York giving
President Johnson a 750,000 vote
plurality. the Republicans face more
difficulties than most press releases
admit.

When the move to the new cam-
pus is made, it is certain that
Minerva will not meet the same
fate as a weather-worn landmark

Lubbock, Texas. -

The Dally Toreador reports that
“students returned from Christmas
vacation to find the wings and nose
wheel were the only reminders of
the F-84 Thunder jet fighterbomber,
which had been on display outdoors
on campus since 1958.

“A scrap metal dealer bought
the remains for approximately $100.

No matter what you consider the
most unusual concert you've ever
heard, you’d have to go a long
way to find something to top this
one.

Axither and Concertina Serenade

“An out-of—tune zither and a
concertina were played at a night—
time serenade, according to dis-
patches reaching The Record, St.
John’s University, Collegeville,
Minnesota.

“However, some persons within
hearing range suggested the music
may have been provided by a sack-
butt, 3 dulclmer and a tuba.”

“A Benet Hall Freshman is
rumored to have bounced from bed
at the height of the harmony and
conducted his entire floor to the
shelter area in the basement,where
he sandbagged the door and kept
eVeryone until morning singing
“Tenting Tonight.”

Admirable Composure
“He was described as ‘main-
taining admirable composure the
whole time the attack was going
on.l H

According to the following report
from the Michigan State News,some
people hink stealing from libraries
is a snap.

“The University library has at-
tempted to eliminate, or at least

reduce, book thefts by students.
“Methods used to date have
failed.”

“Students can and do steal books.”

“We did it."

“Not only books, but magazines,
newspapers, microfilm and docu-
ments.”

books to enter’ the book contest
sponsored by the Co-op. It seemsto
me that those people who do not
collect records, have no way to
exhibit their collecting skills at the
present time, other than through
their friends. _

I also propose this contest because
today records are just as impor-
tantly reviewed as books have always
been. Record reviews are standard
features of The Saturday Review,
Hootenanny, The Times Union of
Albany, and The New York Times,
and have recently been featured
in the ASP.

Thus I present this idea to the
student body, Hoping someone or
some group will wish to carry
it out. I also think that it will
help to strengthen our cultural at—
mosphere that Toni Mester, Dr.
Adams, and most recently Cynthia
Goodman have paid so much kind
attention to.

Students Seelt Easy Wall
Toward Intellectual Ideal

To the Editor:

Permit us to say the final words
in the existing controversy which is
attempting to decide whether or not
the intellectual atmosphere at State
is satisfactory. The current and
most offensive complaint is that no,
or very few, intellectual benefits
are offered to students; while those
who oppose this view claim that stu-
dents, while thirstlng for such op-
portunities, have not the time be-
cause of academic pursuits to bene-
fit from those which are presented.

Each school of thought can be re—
duced to the primary complaint that
the student at State is not brought
into enough contact with the in-
tellectual element.

Intellectualism can he defined as
a collective of minds of intelligent
persons. By implication, this means
persons (in the case of students)
who are willing, indeed eager, to
pursue knowledge, to formulate
ideas, and to develop a concept
of existence and reality. For, the
intellectual student realizes that,
in shaping himself in school, he is
preparing himself for the future -
the future in which he will accept
leadership and face responsibility.

Necd we raise the question of
how the greater percentage of State
students compare with these stan-
dards? Examine each point. Pursue
Knowledge? The only knowledge pur-
sued is that critical “inside infor-
mation” of: which teachers are the
easiest, which assigntheleastwork,
winch give the easiest tests and the
highest grades. Next in importance:
is; which exams are on file, which
exams never change. “lld ‘Vhid‘
exams were given yesterday. The

only skill pursued is that of
"throwing a paper together” the
night before it is due. Last, but
not least, is the obscene practice
of securing outline guides which free
the student from ever reading as-
signments and guarantee at least
the almighty “C” in each course.
The goal' to which students dedicate
themselves is that of doing the
least amount of work. Such is the
eager pursuit of knowledge here
at State.

The general condition
student’s ideals vies for the gutter
position of his pursuit of knowl—
edge. Goals consist of avoiding work,
learning as many first names as
possible, and consuming the max—
imum quantity of beer that funds
allow. These “goals” formthebasis
upon which students formulate their
philosophies. their views ofreality-
the philosophies and views thateach
will carry to the world when his
education is completed.

Upon this foundation - the shrink-
ing from pursuit of knowledge, the
social and not intellectual goals,
the idea of doing aslittle aspossible
- the bare minimum - will he
hnilt the World ten years hence.

And yet, the very students who
further such degradations raise an-
dacious voices and cry that they
are not presented with enoughiniel-
lectual opportunities. These oppor—
tunities, 1f presented as infiriituui,
would still illicit no responsetin
the form of attendance from the
majority of State students. The
effort would go uuheeded, except
for the exclainauous arising to the
effect of “Oh yes, in addition to
the excellent grades I receive, 1
am an intellectual.”
