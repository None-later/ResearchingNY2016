Camus" literary Diary Revealing

by J. A. Gomez

weather. 7 The fine, transparent
sunshine yesterday. The bay trem-
bling with light like a moist lip...

Albert Camusﬁowbook, 1935.19.42, I am linked to the world by every-

Alfred Knopf, 224pp., $5.00

At the age of twenty-two, Albert
Camus began to write a type of
literary diary, which he continued
to keep until his untimely death in
1960. ,

Although Camus never originally
intended these diaries or notebooks
to be published, in 1954 he made a
corrected copy of the first seven
books. The first three ofthesebooks
appear in Notebooks l935-i942.

Recurring Themes

The major recurring themes oi
these youthful notebooks are drawn
mainly from Camus’ Algerian en-
vironment and his early attempts
at writing a novel.

The notebooks present an infor-
mative and interesting picture of
Camus, the writer. Although not
altogether missing, Camus, the man,
remains somewhat elusive.

The personal “I” is missing, and
all direct autobiographical incidents
are hidden within an “objective”
frame of expression.

Strong emotional feelings are not
completely devoid in these note—
books, but often they are submerged
deep within stylistic exercises.

Witness “Letter to a man in des—
pair.” In this answer to a hypo-
thetical letter, Camus seems to
express his own feelings about the
horrors of the war, the stupidity of
society, and the possible hope of a
compromise treaty in the early
years of World War II.

Lyrical Element

The early notebooks are espe—
cially effective in displaying a lyri-
cal side of the author's style and
his youthful attraction to an “in-

stinctive communion” with nature.

“A day of sunshine and clouds.
The cold spangled with yellow. I
ought to keep a diary of each day’s

Whale“!

thing I do, to men with all the
gratitude I feel ”

Philosophy and the Novel

Many entries contain the seed-
lings of philosophical ideas which
were to reach full bloom in later
novels and essays. The ideas of
the absurd and tragic awareness
of death which permeate his major
novels are pondered over in these
early notebooks.

For Camus, philosophical ideas
and the genre of the novel are in-
timately linked together. “A novel
is never anything but a philosophy
put into images. And inagood novel,
the whole of the philosophy has
passed into the images.”

Within the pages of the first two
notebooks, the events, ideas, and
characters of Camus’ proposed first
novel, La Mort Heureuse,are slowly
metamorphosed into the framework
of Camus’ actual first novel,
L'Etranger.

The somewhat unsatisfied and de-
liberate Patrice Mersault becomes
the indifferent Meursault. Charac-
ters and incidents are abandoned;
others are transformed into inci-
dents and characters of L'Etranger.
The “invincible summer” of the
Algerian setting, however, remains
roughly the same.

Conscious Stylist
In The Plague, the character

and extreme, but like his character,
Camus, in a less extreme manner,
is an especially conscious'stylist.
He wrote seven versions of The
Fall and numerous versions of his
other works.

The Notebooks provide the reader
with an opportunity to compare the
imagery and idea of many early
fragments with the final versions in
the early novels.

It must be noted, however, that
many of the short observations of
Algerian life and the recordings of
actual conversation are incorpor-
ated into the novels without any
significant change.

Contract to Pavese

It is interesting to contrast the
diaries of Cesare Pavese with the
Notebooks of Camus. Like Camus,
Pavese began writing his diary in
1935 and continued to keep a diary
until his death.

In many respects, both writers
have much in common. Both were
influenced by some of the same
writers; both had early, unhappy
love affairs, and both ﬂirted with
the Communist movement.

Whereas Camus' diary does not
even mention the two latter points,
Pavese’s journal is a deep pene-
tration into the black abyss of pro-
longed introspection.

In The Burning Brand: l935~l950,
Pavese, the tortured, tormented hu-
man being, painfully emerges from

The Milt Cavendish Trio—Fred
LeBrun, Alex Delfini, and Linda
Heifer — represented Albany State
at the Northeastern Folk Music
Conference held at Hamilton Col-
‘lege, March 13th and 14th. The
purpose of the conference was to
discuss the nature of folk music
and the phenomenon of its present
popularity.

Weak Script, Characterizations Mom...

Undermine ‘ilnce

by Roberta Trenknen

Despite the attempt at “sophis-
tication” and topical satire, Once
Upon a Mattress got off the ground
only in the song sequences. The
weak book is redeemed by Mary
Rodger’s lilting music, Marshall
Baker’s clever lyrics, colorful cos-
turning, and exceptionally fine acting
by several actors.

The play began in earnest when
Rosanne Ferrara first appeared de-
claring “I’m Shyl“ Each time Miss
Ferrara appeared, the whole stage
seemed to crackle with energy.
She belted out her songs with clarity,
ease, and charm.

Lobdell Versatile

Jim Lobdell, as the mute king,
expressed more without words than
did many of the characters with
vocal roles. Hls movements were
not limited to the broad gesturing
which made this role comic. He
expressed volumes with the quirk
01 an eyebrow or the shrug of a
shoulder.

Jack Tkatch and Bill Morgan.
as the Jester and Minstrel, made
a delightful trio accompanied sl—
lently by the king in “The Minstrel,
the Jester, and I" which they sang
in the hall of the palace.

Weak Setting

The hall was represented by a drop
depicting three arches. This drop'
was the weakest part of the set
both visually and physically because
it waved and crackled when anyone
touched it or hid behind it. Realism
was not the keynote of the play,
nor should it have been, but the
drop should have been reinforced
because it was a bit disturbing'
to see a stone wall that moved
with a will of its own.

Psi Foéino, playing the Queen,
steamoroliered through her lines.

 

Upon a Mattress’

She was funny, as she always is,
but first and foremost she was Pat
Fasano. Aggravain had no shading
or nuance of voice interpretation
to distlnguish her from any of the
other bossy women which Miss
Fasano has played.

Mary Setter, petite and pretty
as Lady Larkin, looked lovely and
helpless, but when she sang she
was straining her voice. Unfortu-
nately, no one had thought to lower
the key of the music, so Miss
Setten’s voice, which is sweet and
delicate when the notes are within
her range, was forced and weak.

by Paul M. Jansen

In filming the now-legendary
Cleopatra, director Joseph L. Man-
klewicz shot about l40 hours of
film. Eight different writers were
used at various points, and for some
time the script was being written
only tWenty~four hours beforelt was
filmed.

The final estimation of the cost
was about $40 million, but withover
$15 million taken in in advance of
its premiere it was already the
eighth highest grosser in the world.

The film opened in New York with
a length of 4 hours and 3 minutes,
but was immediately reduced by 22
minutes. it is this versron that is
now in general release, and it is in
this form that it must be Judged.

As it stands now, the first hour
and forty—five minutes, up to the
death of Caesar, is very good. The
dialogue is all that one would ex-
pect from Joseph L. Mankiewicz—
bright, witty, intelligent. And it
is delivered with Just the right

picture. Someone should have shown
the courtiers how to move in the
long gowns; they moved as if they
were in street clothes and lost
most of the effect which the flowing
gowns should have produced.

Prince Dauntless,played by Frank
Ryerson, came across as the weak
mama’s boy that he was supposed
to be. Art Putnam, as Sir Harry
could have been much stronger.

Bill Laundry as the Wizard was
sneaky and sly but not sneaky nor
sly enough. The role was not a
big one: however a great deal more
could have been done with it.

Weak Characterizations

Generally, the main problem with
the characters that fell short of

imposing Spectacle

As for the spectacle itself, the
entrance into Rome is exoellent,
with the concluding wink by Miss
Taylor a fine, human touch.

The presentation of Caesar's as-
sassinallon through the augury fires
of Cleopatra was, however, cheating
a bit by avuiding dialogue and ex-
pecting the viewer to assume that
such fires are possible. Also,thlngs
happen too soon and too fast once
Cleopatra arrives in Rome,perhaps
due to the cuts suffered by the film.

Once Upon a Mattress provided
a pleasant evening even with the
shortcomings which were inherent
in the musical itself. Miss Lee
Liss, the director, did a more than
adequate job, and, in spots a mem-
orable one, with a show which had
only the music and lyrics to rec-
ommend it.

Symposium and Workshops

A symposium was held Saturday
morning. Panel members were Dr.
Louis C. Jones, director of the
New York State Historical Associa-
tion, Edward D. lves, author,,col-
lector of northeastern folk music,
folk musician and professor at the
University of Mattie, John A. Scott,
former Professor of History at
Amherst College, and Charles L.
Todd, author and Professor of Rhe-
toric at Hamilton College. They
discussed the question, “What is
Folk Music?"

Among the speakers for the week-
end was Alan Lomax. Mr. Lornax is
among the foremost collectors of

But, on the whoi'e, this section is
very good, and could have beeneven
better had it been released by itself
as a two-and-a-quarter-hour film.
The same would probably be true if
the second half had been released
in a separate, expanded form.

In its present condition, the pic-
ture seems to fall apart after the
intermission. It may be that no one
was sure about Antony's part, but
then again it may only appear that
way because of the cutting and
elimination.

Although, except for an occasional
line, the wit disappears, this is
all right because four hours of wit
tends to get tedious. However, there
seems to have been nothing with
which to replace it.

Burton Boring

Burton wanders about, boozing
and expouudlng about very little of
consequence, As he ﬂirts Wllll Cleo
and ﬂuctuates back and forth between
liking her and not wanting to go
along with her, it gets, I’m afraid,
quite boring.

Tins felony is compounded by the
editing — the setting jumps from
home to Egypt to Athens (even!)
without warning and the only way
to tell where we are is to listen

we are in Rome.”

Poor Editing

Indeed, the main problem here
seems to be the editing, for there
are sortie good lines, some very ef-
fective directorial touches, some
very good shots and even some ex-
citing scenes tn this nonetheless
generally boring hour andaquarter.

Examples are Antony hiding in
the shadows as Octavian's men talk
to Cleopatra; the sea battle, which
does what Ben Hur's didn’t, thanks
to good director and real ships;
and Cleo standing alone on a large

Burton expounds, as if to cover
up the fact that no one really knows
what’s going on. His beautiful voice,
remarkable though it is, is not suf-
ficient to mask the vacuity of much
of the dialogue. This entire part of
the film is haphazard and uncertain.

The last forty-five minutes do
perk up, however, and give cause to
speculate on the quality itcould have
had it released on its own, with
more and lighter scenes.

As Antony finally takes himselfin
hand, discovers his soldiers are
gone, and rides out against Octa-
vian’s troops alone, some emotion,
feeling and eXCitement are once
again generated. And, despite some
jumpy continuity in the later death
scene. again due to cutting l sup-
pose, this last part is pretty good.

The photography is nice, the sets
are exceptionally grand and the di-
rection ls often good but, for a good
part of the picture, the drama has
ended up on the cutting room floor.
