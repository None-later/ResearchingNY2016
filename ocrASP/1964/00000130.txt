,Robert Burlingame, when asked
about the team’s prospects for the
forthcoming season. “We have only
one regular pitcher back from last
year, Ray Weeks."

Tennis Team Improved;

Number One Player Back

By Jim Wingote

On Saturday, April 18, the Albany
State varsity tennis team will open
the 1964 season withamatch against
the Plattsburgh squad. Leading this
year’s quest for victories will be
John Barthelmes. The number one
man last year, John hopes to improve
upon his fine record.

Another senior, John Sturtevant
the number two man last year is
back to add his talents to the veteran
squad. Ed Wolner and Keith Costello
are seasoned players and are ex-
pected to bolster the tearn’s worth.
Ed was fourth man and Keither was
number five.

Slocum Shows Promise

Tom Slocum, last year's frosh
ace is the most promising prospect
of the newcomers. Other spots on
the team are still open and will be
fought for by Sophomores Don Vig-
ars, Rick Axevsen and Bill Enser.

The veterans compose most of
the squad and are the reason Coach
Hathaway thinks that this year’s
team is much stronger.

The schedule is more difficult
with several tough competors being
added to the state! They are RPI,
New Haven and Oswego. Trouble
by the name of St. Peter’s is also
on the agenda. “No game is a
sure thing,” says the coach “and

to be the most formidable toe of the
new season. They were responsible

Maurer Back

Fred Maurcr, (Balls-ton Spa) re-
turns to the number one spot, but
he is sure of a battle from Mike
Bayts for this year's honors. Doug
Morgan is back for his third year
and adds depth to the squad.

With the three top veterans form-
ing the hard core the team adds
extra strength with returinngletter—
men Paul Bachorr. and John Vrtiak.
These men proved to be the decisive
factors many times last year.

Stan ltosen is the onlynon-ietter-
man to break into the powerful line-
up. Stan showed a great deal of
promise in the tall tryouts and
should add to the strength of the
squad.

Stove Walter will see action as
the seventh titan on the team. Steve
is up front the freshman team of
last year. Coach Sauers said that
"the team will lose one game at-

Gary chipped in with a .327 aver-

man, also captained the soccer team
this year. Coach Buriinganie is
hoping that Smith will be able to get
into shape in the limited time that
his student teaching allows.

The other returning .300 hitter is
Junior Don McGurrin. Don batted
.312 during the 1963 campaign. Mike
Putney, second baseman, is another
returning regular who Coach Bur-
lingame is counting on for a good

ear.

The infield is all set except for
third base which is a toss—up. The
outfield positions are also wide open.

‘iluddat to Head Budget Committee;

Senate to Form Camp Board Policy

Udo Guddat ’66 was appointed by Student Association
President Arthur Johnston ’65 to head the Senate Budget
Committee at last Wednesday’s meeting. Appropriations
were given to Statesmen and deniedto the Dramatics and
Arts Council. The Organizational Recognition Commit-
tee was given the authority to write down the policy of

Senate toward Camp Board.
The Inter Fraternity
Council-Inter Sorority
Council was given permis-
sion to solicit for an Ug—
0liest Man and Ugliest Wo-
man Contest.

Closed Session

In a closed session the speakers
for Moving Up Day were chosen.
The results of this part ofthe meet-
ing will not be known until Moving
Up Day, May 16.

The Budget Committee as pro-
posed by President Johnston is to
include chairman Guddat, William
Sinnhold ’66, Finance Committee
Chairman Harry Gardner ’65,Kath-
erine Brown ’67, and Nancy Shuba
’67.

Senate will vote on establishing

. the membership of this committee
“next week.

Senator David Bratt ’64 was ap-
pointed to fill one ofthe two Senate
vacancies on the Department of
Recreation. Senator William Sinn-
hold ’66 was appointed to Camp
Board.

Money Delayed, At Least
A request by Dramatics and Arts
Council for $250.00 was defeated
with 18 in favor, 14 against and
five abstentions. A majority of all
those present plus those absent
illegally is needed.

The money was to be used to
pay for a part of the bill for the
Council’s guest artists. In the
fall, D & A was under the impres-
sion it had $250 more than they
needed.

The money was volunteered to
the budget cutting group. It now has
been revealed that the group was
mistaken in thinking they did not
need the extra money.

The reasoning behind the defeat
of the proposal was based on the
alleged non-compliance by D & A
Council with Senate financial rules.
Senators and non-senators ex-
pressed the hope that the money
could come from the income of the
group.

statesmen Represents University

Statesmen, a non-credit course
composed of 26 male voices, re-
quested $200.00 for transportation.
This money was granted and will be
used for travel to and from the
World’s Fair. They will sing in the
New York State pavilion on Univer-
sity Day, May 9.

The discussion on this request
was highlighted by a brief statement
by Patricia Fasano ’65,amember of
MYSKANIA. She advocated passage
of the proposal on the ground that the
group will provide excellent repre-
sentation of the university.

Count Leo Tolstoy speak about her

ious phases of his liteary career.
To Count Leo Tolstoy, life was
always a striving, aimed at doing

Family Provided Characters

Probably the best known of'l‘ol—
stoy’s works is the masterful novel
War and Peace. In this, as in
Anna Karenina in his later novels
such as Resurrection, Tolstoy drew
his characters and principles from
his surroundings, many times using
the qualities to be found in members
of his own family.

in writing War and Peace, Tolstoy
studied the actual physical environ-
ment in which the Napoleonic Wars
involving Russia and France took
place.

While writing Anna Karenina T01—
stoy underwent a change in his phil-
osophy. His inteest in life became
sparked with a desire to fulfill the

$3 Tax Increase for Fiscal 64-65

Student Tax next year will jump
three dollars above its present total
to $46. This is due to a three
dollar increase iii Student Associa-
tion’s tax to $27.50 per student.

The Athletic Tax of $18.50 will
remain unchanged next year.

This Student Tax figure is based
)ll an estimated enrollment of 3100
full-time undergraduate, and 200
full—time graduate, students next
year.

The entire Student Association
Budget will be limited to a ceiling
of $91,000 next year. These figures
were announced by Arthur Ferrari
’66, Commissioner of Finance, at
the initial meeting of Cabinet Min—
isters and the heads of budgetary
organizations last Friday.

The Communications on campus
will be limited to a total of $39,700
in the 1964-65 budget. Culture re-
ceived a ceiling of $24,600.

Organizations under Recreation
and Government will be limited to
totals of $19,700 and $7,000 res-
pectively.

Commissioner Ferrari felt that
these figures are a satisfactory
solution to the problem of budget—
ing.

“0n the one hand, the organiza—
tions honestly want to grow. On
the other, we have to watch the
student's pocket books. I think these
figures draw the line pretty well."

The budgetary organizations in
each classification will be required
to stay within the ceilings set for
their classifications.

The heads of these organizations
will meet tomorrow to present their
proposed budgets to their respective
Cabinet Coimnisioners. This will
be the first step in obtaining final
Senate approval of next year’s pro-
posed budget.
