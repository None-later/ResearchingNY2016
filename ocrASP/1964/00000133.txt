fthe organization and development
of many of the musical organiza-
tione here. in his first six years

Droniotice Organised

Dramatics as an organized ac-
tivity began in 1919 With the guid-
ance of Miss Agnes i-‘utterer and
Miss Eunice Perirre.

Miss r'utter‘er retired in 1959
after forty—two years of servrce to
State. She started courses in play
production and taugirt classes ill
speech, English, drama and oral
interpretation. iier advanced dra—
rrratrcs classes put on several orie-
act plays as far back as 1917.

One of her outstanding achieve—
merits at State was the iourrdirrg oi
Dramatrcs and Arts Council. This
group immediately aroused much
interest ill its activities by bring-
ing many leading performing artists
it) State.

in 1926 she pi esented an organ to
the Alumni Association. it was tone
plat ed in the alumni residence hall.

The organ was presented to her

German Club plays. sorority playlets and musicals, a chorus singing class. and

a small orchestra.

A dramatics club was organized in 1910 to fill a “long felt need” for some
opportunity to discover and help any histrionic talents students possessed. Th:
members studied early plays, the writings of Longfellow, and the play, “Pandora.

The group presented one
play each year.

However. meetings were
not well attended and the
group did not ﬂourish.

The first organized musical group
was an orchestra that was started
in 1915 when a group of interested
students in an English 1 class began
the group. There was mucir initiative
on the part of the students during
the formative years of music and
drama.

Mandolin Club

To supplement the college or-
chestra which lasted as a student
run group until 1944 when Dr. Stokes
came and added his guidance, there
was a Music Club, a Sophomore or-
chestra, and a Mandolin Club, all of
which began in 1917.

There was a chorus singing class
in 1916. A newspaper article that
year appealed to “all those who sing
or think they can sing” to jam and
participate in the operetta that was
planned.

Miss Futterer’s drama class was
a part of the curriculum in 1918. it
was essentially a club where all
students could belong with the corr-
sent oi the instructor.

Operatic Society
liming the ill-10's there was air
Operatic Socier at State. The,

group lasted for about ten years.
Most of the yearly programs it
presented were Gilbert and Sullivan
operettas. Some of the things it
produced were “Iolanthe,” “Pi-
rates of Penzance,” “H.M.S. Pina-
fore,” “Patience,” and “The M1-
kado.”

Gradually the students involved
voiced the opinion that they would
like to give a production produced
and directed by students with no
faculty help.

This gave rise to the State Uni-
‘versity Revue which was initiated
in 1957.

When Dr. Candlyn left in the
spring of 1943, there were only
two mustc courses in existence on
music iiistory and appreciation.

Bond Initiated

Dr. Stokes came in 1944 and won-

credit for the students participating
in orchestra. He started a band and
marry ensembles.

Dr. Peterson of the music depart-
rnent came in 1949 and has taugtrt
several courses in voice. He has
developed nrany ciroruses and helped
iortn the Statesmen in the early
1950’s.

The department is now attire point
where the addition of a major in
rnusrc is under consideration. it is
hoped that rriore music faculty will
be added when the college moves to
the new campus.

ably Will be establishedandadegree

Areno Theatre

State has been a pioneer in the
field oi Arena Theatre in colleges
and holds Workshops in it during
the summer.

A Little Theatre was corrstrur-ted
rrr 1956 in Richardson iiali wrttr a
small capacity. it is used for play
rchear'sals and pr'otlUctions of Ad-
vanced Dramatics plays. At the
storm tiriie a music rehearsal roorri
was constructed.

All of these developrrienis have
made the music and drama programs
what they are today arrdmadepeople
aware that the students want more
opportunities in these fields. Tire
facilities at the new campus Will
give students litany Iiitil‘e tipptil‘-

e Updike Novel Presents

Conﬂict of Value System

by “00hr Melly
The Poorhoueo Foir, by John Updike

The Poorhouee Foir is not a book
that this reviewer recommends as
terrific.

Technically, the work is well
done, precisely done, economically
done. In a brief one hundred and
twenty-seven pages, Updike con-
structs the country poorhouse,
peoples it with two dominant, be-
cause antithetical, personalities,
end several minor characters. He
sets the old-fashioned values of the
world of the poorhouse in opposition
to the values of the world outside.
What results is a somber, despair-
ing criticism of contemporary
American culture.

Tension Between Values

The tension between the two value
systems, the“old American” values
of honesty and hard work and cur-
rent emphasis on getting something
for nothing and the easy life emerges
in the dialog between Conner, the
director of the county home, and
Hook, a 94-year old inmate.

Conner is the spokesman for the
world outside in the tight sphere of
the poorhouse. He is certainly not
the most vicious product of the new
and corrupted values. He is a pro-
fessional humanitarian. He willing-
ly devotes his life to nrakingtheiast
days of the initiates comfortable.

But the task for him rsthe way up,
the way to a better admirrr‘strativa
post in the welfare department. For
the present ire sees his jolt as the
comfort of his charges Since, ire
believes, in contrast to the inmate
themselves, that “this was their
final reward.”

Conner realizes steadily through-
out the novel that there is aterribie
vacuity to his life. He does not earn

the gratitude of the old people that t that

would rrrake his Job worthwhile. He
doesn't believe in God or in aytirlrrg
beyond the rraturai realm. “lie had
lost all sense of omen.”

Personal Voculty

Tire emptiness, the lack of mean-
ing of his existence — srrrce those
who are his concern offer iriirr no
thanks — is the gap he presents to
Hook to fill,

Hook is aware oi vacancy in
Conner and of the stra.n between
their systems of values. That he

is a retired reach seems fitting
in terms of his relationship to
Conner.

But he is a teacher with nothing
to teach that will make any im-
pression on the younger man. His
own faith in God and the value of
life, his ruminations on the neces-
sity of struggle and the meaning of
virtuous action are based on as-
sumptions and conception that are
utterly incomprehensible to Conner.

In the end the question is left un-
answered. The tension between the
struggle and the easy life is unre-
solved. There is no communication
between the spokesmen for the two
worlds.

Statements about the book seem to
divide into two levels: technique and
theme.

in terms of technical devices and
expression The Poorhouse Fair is
admirable. The unity of time and

The silent films have gained pop-
ularity amid both the faculty and
a growing segment of the student
body interested in the art the cinema
and/or the high entertainment value
of films such as those of Douglas
Fairbanks.

In an effort to expand this program
and to provide an even wider cross-
section of the history of films, the
l.F.G. intends next year to innau-
gurate it new series— featuring the
films of the thirties.

Once more, a wide variety of
motion pictures will be included,
from the “screwball comedy” of
Nothing Sacred to the power of
Edward G. Robinson’s Little Coeeer
from the eerie mood of Tod
Brownings Merit of the Vampire
to the emotional impact of Stein-
beck’s Of Mice and Men.

place is very tight:the actionoccurs
on one day in the County Hoirre.
Tire description of the setting and
the characters is careful and often
too detailed. There are passages
in which the language is so compact
and so concentrated that reading is
like chewing.

But for the reader who wishes
what is well said he Worth
thinking about, The Poorhouse Fair
is disappotrrting. Tire trarrsrrrutatiorr
of cultural values, significant as it
is, iras not been presented in aform
dramatic or memorable enough to
raise the theme above the level of
a cornrrronplace.

The statement “Things aren’t
what they used to be,” rernarns
rrrorc trite than important. Mr.
Updike has undoubted control of
his medium; it is unfortunate that
he hasn’t sorrrething more inter-
esting to say.

As part of its planned program
expansion, the international Film
Group will next year present a
total of four film series.

An impressive array of films,
thirty three in all, are planned
for the regular schedule of popular
and entertainment films. A wide
variety of types and titles have
been selected, ranging from mu-
sicals such as Iondwegen through
Hitchock'e impressive Psyche.

Drornoe Presented

In addition to comedies, including
The Notorious Londlody and Ash
Any Girl, a number of recent, well-
known dramas will be presented,
such as To Kill o Mockingbird and
This Sporting Life, as well as such
modern classics as On the Wotorh
front and The Innocents.

These films will, as is usual,
be shown on Friday evenings with
an occasional feature on Saturday.
Also presented on Saturday evenings
will be a newly inaugurated, sep-
arate set of foreign-language films.

These pictures have been care-
fully chosen to represent some of
-the best international film-making
of recent, and in two cases earlier,
years. in addition, they provide
an experience in practical listening
to a foreign language that is quite
different from the more controlled,
