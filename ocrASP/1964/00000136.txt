Slocum’s hustling and fine play which
resulted in his victory. '

Potts Bow to Shot in 12 things; ’
Weeks Boos little in 4-3 necision

by Harold Lynne

Capitalizing on a ragged performance by the Platts-

burgh Cardinals, the baseball team scored an easy
17-6 victory last Saturday on University Field. The
game was close for the first six innings, but in the
seventh the Peds exploded for six runs and in the
eighth they came through with four more runs.

Dick Kimball was cred-
ited with the win. Kim-
ball relieved starting
pitcher- Joe Mazzuruli in
the fifth inning with one
out and runners on first
and second, and the score
6-4 in favor of Albany.

One Run Scores

Third baseman Pep Pizziloo made
a good stop on a hard hitground ball
and forced a runner at second. With
men on first and third, Kimball
caught the runner off first, but be-
fore the runner could be tagged out
the man on third tried to score and
Putney’s throw was not in time.

Kimball retired the next batter to
end the Plattsburgh threat. In the
bottom of the inning State picked up
one run to increase its lead 7-5.

Early Lead

The Peds moved out to an early
lead in the first inning Pizillo led
off with a sharp single to left and
stole second base on the first pitch
to Mike Putney. Putney’s infield
out advanced Pizillo to third from
where he scored on a wild pitch.

In the third inning the team took
an imposing 6-0 lead. Two walks
and an infield hit loaded the bases.
Another wild pitch accounted for a
run. An infield out knocked in ano-
ther run. A walk to Gary Smith and
hits by Dick Odorizzi and Tony
Macaluso rounded out the scoring.

Plattsburgh came back with four
runs in the fourth inning. BobMun-
ley sparked the Cardinal scoring
with a three-run homer. The home

lomorrow, Coach
Garcia Optimistic

Starting their season tomorrow,
the frosh tennis team will face
the racqueteers of Albany Phar-
macy. Coach Garcia is optimistic
about the team’s prospects for the
coming season.

One of the main reasons for
his optimism is the high school
export» no of most of the men on
the team. Ken Zacharias and Dave
Gorey each have four years varsity
Malcolm Provost played ior three
years in high school and Stan Kerpol
for l.Wll.

liounding out the team is Dave
iiunier and Sam Cypresni who have
no high school experience.

Coach Garcia feels that the team
has greater depth this year titan in
the past and should better the losing
record of last year. lie has coin-
menled favorably about the enthu—
slasni of each man and the large
amount of Work they have done.

The number one and two men
respectively on the team are Zach-
artais and Corey. The remaining

run, a low line drive to right center
field, hit the top of the fence and
dropped over.

Six Run Seventh
In the big seventh inning the Peds
sent twelve men to the plate. Don
Mason got two hits in this inning.
With the aid of two errors and two
wild pitches State was able to score
six runs on only three hits.

Due to the Cardinals errant play
State was able to notch 17 runs with-
out even one extra base hit. Mixed
in with the team’s twelve singles
were thirteen bases on balls, eight
Plattsburgh errors, seven wild
pitches, and one balk.

Lose to Siena

in the season’s opener last Fri-
day the Peds lost a twelve inning
nip and tuck battle, 4-3, to the Siena
Indians at Siena. Ray Weeks pitched
the entire game for State, giving up
ten hits and only one walk. In the
contest Albany left sixteen men
stranded on base.

Siena took an early 2-0 lead. The
varsity nine came back with one run
in the sixth. They loaded the bases
with only one out but could only push
one run across the plate; that run
was forced in by a walk.

In the ninth inningthe Peds knotted
the score to send the game into ex—
tra innings. Weeks led off with a
single. Pizillo sacrified him to sec—
ond but the throw to first was wild.
Weeks went to third on the error
and Pizillo took second. A sacri-
fice fly by Putney tied the game.

State went ahead in the eleventh
inning. McGurrin was safe on an
error and Smith doubled him home.
However, Smith was stranded when
the next three men popped up. Siena
bounced back in the bottom of the
eleventh to tie up the game again.

The Indians put the game away
in the twelfth. The leadoi‘l man
singled and stole Second. Then next
man lashed a line drive between
third and short and McGurrin tent-
porarily saved the game with a

divmg stab. But the next man looped
a single to center field to knock in
the winning run.

Budget Formulation

The budgets which will be pre-
sented to Budget Committee in the
next ten days were formulated last
Saturday in meetings between Cab-
inet Commissioners and the Heads
of the individual budgetary organ-
izations.

These budgets in their present
form stand very little chance of
clearing Budget Committee without
substantial cutting in many areas.

Even Johnston has been quoted
as saying that he does not lend
his support to many of the items
in some budgets.

The heads of the budgetary or-
ganizations must be present atthese
open hearings to explain and defend
their requests.

Senators are urged to attend these
meetings to avoid time-wasting
questions and debate on the Senate
floor when the final budget as ap-
proved by Budget Committee comes
to a vote.

Final approval or defeat of the
budget will be made by Senate on
either May 6 or May 13.

Increased Scope

The first workshop of the re—
organization series was lield last
Saturday afternoon. The major por-
tion of the two and one-half hour
session was spent iii trying to de-
fine a philosophy of the organiza-
tion.

Among the ideas which came out
of Saturday's session was the pro-
posal to increase the scope of AWS
to include all women students of the
University. Ultimately AWS could
become a women’s government rep-
resenting University women in de-
veloping University policies which
affect women.

These policies, in addition to
regulation of hours, could include
a dress code and a general code of
conduct. Another possibility is for
AWS to take over the function of
planning and coordinating social
events of interest to all women.

Compilation
The real compilation of next
year’s Student Association budget
will take place during these meet-
ings. Tile vote on the Senate floor
is expecting to be only a rubber
stamp for the work done by the
committee.
All hearings are open
