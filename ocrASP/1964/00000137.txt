Colgan Elected Editor of ‘lorch’
Announces Croup Picture Policy

William Colgan ’65 was elected
editor of the student yearbook, The
Torch, this week. He succeeds
Evelyn Petrick ’64 as pilot of the
yearly publication.

For the past year Colgan has
served as Editor-in-Chief of the
Albany Student Press. He has
never worked on a yearbook either
in high school or college, but ex-
presses a keen desire to meet the
new challenges faced in putting out
The Torch.

“I think the fact that Iam com-
pletely inexperienced in yearbook
work underscores one of the main
weaknesses in The Torch ,“ said
Colgan.

"The staff of the yearbook has
always been ridiculously small for
the importance of the work in-
volved. I plan to build up a staff
and provide for some continuity
in the editorship of The Torch."

The Torch has always received
one of the largest yearly appro-
priations of all the organizations
within Student Association.

Colgan said, “With so much money
involved, The Torch should certainly
be better organized. I hope to make
students realize how important the

Colgan also announced that all
Senior pictures will be taken in
May. No pictures will be taken in
the fall. I

There will also be a change in
policy concerning the taking of pic-
tures for organizations.

William Colgan
...New Yearbook Editor
All organizations, not directly
supported by Student Association“
will be required to pay for their
pictures and page in the yearbook.
This policy would apply to groups
like religious clubs and honorartes.
In the past only the fraternities
and sororities were required to pay
for their sections in the book.
The fee which will be charged
these organizations will be an-
nounced in a few weeks.

Colgan said this policy was
adopted to increase the revenues
of The Torch which have been very
low in the past.

Faculty to Try Sartre j '  [Willem al 
During English Evening ' ' Inspires Illitersity Hedﬂl pmgmms of Annual S

The spring English Evening will be held this Sunday,
at 7:30 p.m. in Brubacher Lower Lounge. The program,
“Sartre on Trial.” will feature two State University
professors, Morris Berger of the Department of Educa-
tion and Gustave Dispas of the Department of Modern

Foreign Languages.
Professor Dispas will be
acting as “prosecutor” of
the French philosopher,
Jean Paul Sartre, while Dr.
Berger has undertaken his

defense.

Mr. Harry Staley of the Depart-
ment of English will be partici-
pating as moderator.

Sartre Today

Sartre, who lives in Paris at
the present, is one of the most
controversial of modern thinkers.
He is the acknowledged current
spokesman for the continental school
of thought traditionally called "Ex-
istentialism.”

Although the history of existential
thought dates back to Kierkegaard
(1813-1855), it is by no means a
narrowly defined philosophy.

Chem Students Cive
Papers at Symposium

Three State students, Paul Briggs
'65, Peter Froelich ’64 and Ronald
Kent ’64 presented papers at the
Ninth Annual Intercollegiate Chem-
istry Symposium held on April 18
at Russell Sage College in Troy.
The Symposium was sponsored by
the Eastern New York Section of the
American Chemical Society.

The papers described research
work that the students have been
doing in the Chemistry Department
Laboratories. Paul Briggs’ work
was entitled “The Lithium Alumi-
num Hydride Reduction of 4-Phe-
noxy, 4-Methoxy, and 4-Thlophe—
noxy Quinazoline."

Peter Froelich’s paper was en-
titled “The Attempted Preparation
of Substituted Butadienes.” Ronald
Kent’s paper was entitled “Lithium
Aluminum Hydride Reduction of
Chloro Substitute Quinazolines.”

Paul Briggs and Ronald Kent have
been working with Dr. Richard Smith
under a National Science Foundation
grant, while Peter Froelich has been
working with Dr. Olafsson on a
senior research project.

Gabriel Marcel, who appeared
at State last fall, is also con-
sidered an Existentialsit, but has
vehemently opposed much of‘Satre’s
writings.

The University Theatre selected
one of Sartre’s plays, The Flies,
’as this year’s long-run produrttion
in the Richardson Theatre.

Students and faculty members who
wish to become more familiar with
the work of Sartre might wish to
visit the CO-OP or the John Mistle-
toe Bookstore, both of which are
featuring special exhibits this week.

English Evening, seeking to pro-
mote the current Sartre dialogue
and answer some of the questions
raised by it, will attempt to define
and analyze some of his best known
concepts.

Sartre’s work covers a broad
range of forms, from his philo—
sophical Being and Nothingness, to
his famous novel Nausea and his
plays.

Some of his other books include
Philosophical Works, The Emotions,
Existential Psychoanalysis, Psy-
chology at Imagery, The Wall and
Other Stories, and the Roads of
Freedom. His latest work is an
apology for Jean Genet, St. Genet.

The English Evening discussion
will not focus on any one work,
but will be concerned with Sartre’s
overall philosophy.

An informal coffee hour will con-
clude the program, in the tradition
of English Evening.

Clemson University pioneered in
student health protection when it
successfully completed a special
program designed to immunize col-
lege students against common di-
seases. Its success has consequently
promoted the idea of similar pro-
grams on college campuses through-
out the country.

96% of Students

The program followed at Clemson
involved 96% of the more than 4,300
students enrolled there. They were
immunized against polio and in-
fluenza and given x-rays for tuber-
culosis detection.

By design of the Clemson Student
Health Association, the program
consisted of three separate medi-
cal sessions carried out over an
eight week period.

At the first, students were given
oral doses of polio vaccine, effec-
tive against all three types of polio,
and screened for tuberculosis with
the needle-free Tuberculosis Tine
Test.

New Penalty Fee Set
For Faulty Registration

There will be a one dollar serv-
ice charge for each adjustment a
student makes in his course sched-
ule after he has completed regis-
tration. There will be no charge
for any changes made before this
deadline.

Charges will be made for student
error in selecting courses or course
numbers, changes due to course
failure, or to suit student conven-
ience for part-time work or com-
mutation schedules.

The polio and influenza immuniza-
