 liti, Campus Viewpoint Budgets Need Scrutiny

The Student Senate is about to begin
the second stage of the annual ritual of
giving budgets to the various organiza-
tions on campus. There has, in the past,
been a rather complete lack of ques-
tioning of purpose during this process.

We of the ASP feel that Senate should
question the purpose of the organiza-
tions which are asking for money. There
is no justification for giving money to a
group which is not fulfilling a purpose.

Three groups stand out in this early
stage of the game. Although the reasons
for this standing out are near opposites.
they all demand the attention of all.

The Primer is the one group which
stands out because it is attempting to
more fully fulfill its purpose. It pro-
poses to have a volume each semester,
instead of each year as now.

Such a change will increase student
interest in the magazine and should
lead to a general improvement.

The Dramatics and Arts Council. on
the other band, should be the subject of
a thorough investigation. Last year and
this, the people in charge of spending
the monies which are alloted for the
major productions have been unable to
control expenditures in a proper way.

Both last year and this, the fourth
and last production has been run on a
miniscule budget. Admittedly last year
was worse than this year. but this does
not excuse this year’s situation.

While The Raft of the Medusa prom-
ises to be a good production. it is not
receiving anywhere near the $600.00
which was intended for each of the four
major productions.

If the entire affair were planned and
run and controlled by students, we could
excuse the situation as we excused the
situation of last year with the Revue.but
faculty members are in control of vir-
tually every step of the productions.

The Dramatics and Art Council was
given a line of $2400 for four major
productions. All three of the first three
productions exceeded their theoretical

$600 limit.
If this production can be done on a

budget of $350, why is it that D & A is
asking for $750 per play for next year?

Why, indeed, is D l A aslring for money for
plays at all? The Revue puts on a musical
production every year without Student Asso-
ciation support.

if the faculty in the Drama division
were willing to produce plays which
would command an audience, they would
be able to support their productions by
charging $1.00 per student, or evenless.

Dramatic productions are much
cheaper than musical productions. The

iievuc with no professional people faces

a more difficult task than the Drama

faculty.
If the students had to pay for each of the

[dramatic and other productions of a theatrical

nature, these productions would become more
than a cheap date. The play would have to be
by authors known by students or of a nature
of interest to the students.

We can see no reason for supporting
the dramatics system as it is now set
up. We hold to this view because

1. the plays are producedinefficiently

2. most of the plays are of little in-
terest to non-devotees of theatre

3. half the plays are produced in
R-290 where there would have to be
40 performances for all students and
faculty to view the play

4. there is no attempt to interest
students in productions

5. the productions are often little
more than workshops for credit

courses.
Until there is an attempt to finance the pro-

ductions in a more uniform and efficient meth-
od, until there is an attempt to interest non-
droma students in plays, until there is an at-
tempt to produce plays of more general inter-
est, we can see no justification for giving
away another budget to the Dramatics and Art
Council for maior productions.

A second group which has endangered
itself by irresponsibility is the Com-
pus Viewpoint. Since this handbook pub-
lication is involved in the same process
(printing) as the ASP, we are sure of
our conclusions.

This conclusion is that the Campus
Viewpoint does not deserve a budget.
The editor has made no effort to limit
let alone reduce the costs of the pub-
lication.

The ASP changed printers when we
learned of a more inexpensive printer.
When we learned of a less expensive
method of reproducting pictures, we
changed to this new method. The Cam-
pus Viewpoint has not checked with
even one printer other than the one
that messed up this year’s book.

The content of the handbook was
greatly improved this year, but the
quality of printing is near to negli—
gible. The printer has promised to
make improvements, but thisis one
of the most expensive printers in a
20 mile radius.

As things stand now. the budget of
the Campus Viewpoint proposes to be
needlessly expensive.

For the reasons we have indicated,
we feel each of the 45 remaining sena-
tors should question carefully both the
budget for the Campus Viewpoint and
the major productions line for D & A.

mick Registration iiuestioneri

The last month has been aperiodof general registra-
tion in many Southern States. After the recentpressures
exerted by the Federal government, many states are
making an all—out effort to increase the voter registra—
tion among those who had not been able to vote before

because of discrimination.

While in most areas the mission was done with most
honorable intentions, some of the aspects of the cam-
paign in one Southern city deserve to be reviewed.

The literacy test has been so restricted that it can
no longer serve as a weapon against future voters. In
this particular city, the decision of whether or not a
candidate for registration was literate was left to the
discretion of the registrar appointed by the City Coun—
cil. Some of the registrars “prompted” the candidate
over what was termed “the big words.” In some
cases, the prompting became considerable.

In at least one case, a candidate was only required
to recognize his name among several. The question
might well be raised: “How many of the newly regis-
tered voters were really eligible?”

The justification for this lightening of the require-
ments has been limited to a condemnation of the South—
ern school system followed by the query “What else
can we do to facilitate the desegregation and respon-
sible legislation in the South?”

It must be pointed out that giving the vote to those
citizens who are incapable of reading more than ele-
mentary material would hardly be the means toachieve
responsible legislation. The most cherished tool of a
democracy is the intelligent vote.

Because of the nature of the South, the Democratic
Party has managed to maintain a nearly one-Party
system. Here. too, the methods of registration might
be questioned. Occasionally, the candidate had not party
affiliation and was carefully told of the Civil Rights
platform of the Democrats with as little mention of
the Republicans as possible. In almost all of these in—
stances, the choice was the donkey rather than the
eagle.

It must be made perfectly clear again that these
practices might not be widespread. We have reports
from only one city in which this is the case. However,
the fact that it can exist in even one city spells poten-
tial trouble.

It is obvious to most people that more responsible
and universal registration is necessary in the South.
It is. however, as dangerous to give the right to vote
to those who are unqualified as to deny it to those who
are.

John Harwick’s Betting System, as devised by Rufus Perry in his book,
How to Play the Horscs and Win is based on a simple modified progres-
sion. The betting begins with $2.00, and with each succeeding bet, the
figure before is added. when a bet is won, the progression begins again,
otherwise it is continued from day to day.

“Just let your National Defense
Loan work for you", says John
“Hot Shot” liarwick, ’20, about his
new infallible system of betting.
In five days of casual betting, the
the calculating mathematician has
piled up a grand total of $98.00
in victory money.

“Hot-Shot” first devised the
system after reading the $1.00 book
How to Play the Horses and win,
by Rufus Perry. Although the book
offers many alternatives, this
system appealed to John because
of its simple logic.

All the bettor requires in stake
money is $120.00. Then, he must
review the daily scratch streets
for the selections of reliable sports
writers. John, for instance, chose
Gene Ward of the Daily News as
his base selector.

From the first place choices of
these selectors, the better then
proceeds to pick his winners.

The Bettor Must Beware

However, says “Hot-Shot” with
a knowing wink, here is where the
real pitfalls lie. In the words of
the great Rufus Perry, “horserac‘ing
is not only picking winners, but
avoiding the losers."

To assure minimum loses, John
has listed a number of basic rules.
The better must however, never play
a race in which:

1. Only two year olds are run-
ning.

2. Maidens are appearing.

3. The horses have not come
into money in their last three
attempts.

4. The horses lack backing.

It is also wise, says the champ,
to bet to place rather than to win.

Playing to Win is Hazardous

The highest that i-iarwick has
bet in a single race is $16.00;
the greatest he has won is $84.00,
in a single race. The figures, he
explained, might be double double
in the profit column had he laid
his money on a straight win ticket.

He felt, however, this betting was
“hazardous”.

Although the betting progression
does not exceed $16.00 bets in a

single race, John added that it was
possible to extend the progression
to higher figures. Of course, only
the extremely wealthy can afford
such heavy bets. John intends to
approach this big money betting next
spring when he has gained a little
more capital.

When the better has lost $40,00
in a single day, he is considered
wiped out, and must begin the pro-
gression again. If a bettor is
wiped out twice consecutively, John
has this piece of sage advice: “Try
another system — stay home."

John has never been wiped out,
and came close to it only once when
he bet $16.00 only to gain $84.00.
This, “Hot Shot" admits, was one of

his better days.

Now that his future seems almost,
assured, Harwick has made some”
revisions in his earlier plans. lie
is seriously considering withdraw-
ing from the University and with-
drawing to a leisurely life on the
track.

Champ is Generous

Far from being greedy and sel-
fish about his new-found bonanza,
John is making his system avail-
able to all who care to use it.
In fact, he adds, “Any girls who
wish to inquire further into my
techniques are invited to call me
at HO 2-32-2 or better yet, drop
in at my home. Boys are invited to
send self-addressed envelopes.”
