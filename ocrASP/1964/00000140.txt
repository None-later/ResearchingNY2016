shown here in an early phase of construction -
iust one example of the growth and change in
the University.

These "'rtigged individuals" forged a new era in

In contrast to the new facilities under construction is the 1884

Normal School Building on Willott Street.

by Debby Friedman and Dave Jonlts

In the Opening week of this academic year, the news-
paper initiated a series of articles dealingwith the rich
past and the moving present of our. university.

It called itself “State College in Transition,” aphrase
which at the time had significant meaning for the series.
But, in the brief span of only seven months, the term
“transition” has lostaits flavor. It has molded and staled
to the point where it leaves an apologetic taste in the
mouth of any who use it.

As we close our oft-thumbed-through book of State
College History we would like to search brieﬂy for
what this Word, this concept of “transition,” has meant
to our institution of higher education.

Basically, it has meant a move, a flux, from old to
new; from that of the past to that of the present and,
more significantly, of the future. This, however, has
not necessarily been a shift from bad to good, or poor
to better.

True, we see more facilities, an expanding curricu-
lum, a broadening of narrow minds, an increase in
staff, a more dynamic cultural program; yet, with all
this must come the increasing costs, the red tape and
administrative confusion, the initial lack of communi-
cation, the dissatisfaction and turmoil of a rigid, often
conservative, student body.

Transition has meant newness; it has brought con—
fusion and turmoil; it has, at times, lacked communi-
cation and planning; it has often meant despair and
discontent; it has at other times evoked a sense of <
pride and accomplishment, but above and beyond all
this it has meant a challenge — a challenge to change,
to take a firm grip on the experiences and opportuni-
ties of the future.

The school will always be in a constant state of

evolution, but the term “transition” will, in a few
years, have been left in the dust of the universities '

intellectual trail. Its many sided polygon of meaning
will remain only with those of us who have beena

part of this compelling challenge.

of the most popular features in

the ASP last semester. We had planned to continue to run gott-
isms this semester, but mysteriously novor'receivod any order
forms from the then CORT headquarters. Millsaps College, Mill-

saps, Mississippi.

Now the mystery has been solved, and we have GORT again.
The following is a copy of the official explanation for the tempo-

rary demise of GORT.

GORT’s a bit late in coming out this semester. We'
have, we believe, a splendid reason for our tardiness.

The astute observer will

cover that GORT has a new address.

note on our new brochure
Behind this

change lies a tale of intrigue and Machiavellian man-

euveurs.

It seems that certain subversive anti-CORT ele-
ments at our old address, Millsaps College, have
succeeded in usurping GORT’s mailbox. Also. certain
of the local citizens have seen fit to form what is
euphemistically entitled a “vigilance committee” and
suggest that GORT would be happier in other environs.

Escort

I At this point GORT would like to thank the Mississ-
ippi Highway -Patrol for their escort to the state line.

those police dogs might have been used more err-i
peditiously had they been directed toward the indignant
throng at our heels rather than at GORT.

But this is a point of little importance. The Patrol,
was most efficient in overturning that barrel of boiling.
tar and scattering those feathers to the wind. Kudosi'

Now you will ask,.“Will GORT take this infamous?
incident sans protest?” GORT replies, “No.” You ask,
“What can we, as conscientious, red-bloodedAmerlcan
students do to combat this intolerable infringement upon

the rights of CORT?”

Gort Answers
l—Indignant letters of protest should engulf the of-
fices of Millsaps. Samples: “A poxon you, Mill-
saps College.” or, “Tut, tut, Millsaps College.”
2—A massive “March on Millsaps” is now in- the
planning stage (Details to follow at a later date.)

Also FOR SALE—Cheap! Several thousandenvelopes,
statements, mailing labels and pieces of stationary on

Collect American

The upper floor showcase ofilaw-

called “Collect American!" start-
ing April 20. Theexhlbitls arranged
so the S.U.N.Y.A. students can get
ideas on what to collect for personal
collections. The emphasis will be on

things both American and old, and
samples of pressed glass, political
campaign buttons, shaving mugs, and
stereoptican slides will be shown.

The items of the exhibit with the
exception of the books, which will
come from the Hawley collections,
will be from the collections of Mile

history, the girls’ residence halls
have a lack of occupants, rather
than a long waiting list. .

“Dormitory life is like living
in a crowded fish bowl where the
food has been allowed to go stale,”
according to some new apartment
dwellers who moved out of the
dorms.

The quality of the food, or the
way it is prepared, is a major
complaint. One Sophomore said:
“I just got sick of seeing “mystery
meat” every night. I gave up try-
ing to figure out what it was." A
Junior said: "About the fourth
time I found hair in my food, I
just gave up and started eating
sandwiches in my room.”

Pressure in Dorms

Another complaint was the extra
pressures from such a large group.
A freshman in psychology st'ited:
“With so many people in one dor-
mitory, there are bound to be some
kids in your classes.

It's an extra pressure to see
someone else with whom you’re
competing in class studying if you
don’t feel like it at the moment.
When you live in a dorm, you’re
not coming home to a home, you’re
coming home to school.”

She added: “An apartment is
a home, a place where you can
come after a date and not have to
wade through necking couples to get
to the door, which can be very
embarrassing."

Said another Sophomore girl: “In
a dorm, the lack of responsibility
attributed to the girls is degrading.
'l‘he housemother and the rules and
regulations seem condescending. We

Of Holding Record Contest

fi "Communications" section of to-

day’s ASP. Upon readingM- Gillie”
William’s suggestion for a "Record
Collectlon Contest,” I too spoke 1“
a few of my friends.

Their reaction was the same as
mine. We all believe that such a
contest would benefit all music en—
thusiasts on campus in these ways:

1. It would enable all the col-
lectors on campus to find what
records they need to collect in
order to complete their collections,

2. It would instill an interest in
all types of music by making the
:10ka of various artists available,
lit

8. It would give us collectors a
chance to show of! what is usually
a ilfetlme's work of collecting.

l have, however, an addition to
make to Mr. Williams list of cute-

gories and that is, Jaw. This is
the field that l, for one, am most
interested in.

to be. I hope the idea catches on.

Student Voices Complaint
On locited Door Policy

To the Editor:

Last Saturday afternoon at ap-
proximately 4:00 p.m. I was down at
the main college buildings with the
purviose of getting a book out of my
locker. I had no reason to doubt
that the doors at the back of the
buildings facing Washington Avenue
Would be open.

Even though the library was open
at that time, the doors were locked,
and because of a pressing tlme
schedule I was prevented from get-
tlng my book.

All during the school year, stu«
dents are required to come back
to the main buildings at night. Most
students approach a front door of
any main building and expect to be
able to enter.

However, these entrances are
usually locked, and cause these
students the inconvenience and
sometimes the danger of exploring
the other entrances. May Iplease
request that those entrances be open
for use at appropriate tlmesi

aren’t treated like adults.”

A Junior who just left the hall
said: “I couldn't stand the com-
pulsory living as a ‘happy family.’
One must follow this tradition and
that tradition, and pretty soon there
isn’t time for anything else.”

Cleanliness was generally termed
good, but a Sophomore who just
moved out of Davidson Hall said:
“There was mold growing at the
bottom of our shower curtains. it
makes you mad because you can’t
do anything about it.”

Men Have Complaints

Although the problem of extra
space is not apparent in the mens’
halls, there was general discontent
among those who recently moved out.
One student said he liked to live on
his own schedule, and if he wanted
to sleep in, he would miss breakfast.

One advantage of an apartment he
said was that he could have parties.
In a hall he couldn’t bring a girl to
his room except during open houses.

A boy who recently left a rest-
dence hall complained that they are
run too much like a fraternity with
compulsory social rule, but they are
too big to act like a fraternity.

Out the Window

A large group of ultra-liberals
bastardlzed in two hours the very
ideals they have stood by through
their college lives..says University
Dolly Kansan, University ofKansas,
Lawrence.

Two conservatives came to ex-
press their views — to voice an
objection to the appearance ofMllan
Opocensky, the Czech theologian who
proposed at KU recently that the
church work within the communist
structure.

To summarize the attitude of the
two Blrchei's in one phrase: They
were narrow-mlndedness suddenly
stood up cm llS lilnd legs and talking.

But the crowd’s reaction was the
part of the forum which was most
appalling. ’I‘he ultra-liberals had a
perfect opportunity to illustrate
their objections. They had a chance
to expose them for what they are,

The most responsible of the far
left have worked on this for a long
time, and to the credit of those who
conducted themselves well. The
rest went berserk.

The ultra—liberals showed them-
selves to be completely intolerant
hecklers and boos who cannot lis-
ten to an opposition view without
loslngthelr heads. _

From now on, anyone from the
far right who speaks on campu; is
either crazy or is a brute for pun—
lshment.

A Loais at Another World

Nine hundred sweaty pounds of
barely clothed flesh slam together
in a smoke-filled auditorium. The
audience Screams lustily, violently,
for, what is dear to them is at stake.
Right and Wrong are locked incom-
bat. and Right usually wins says

Chicago, llllnl. University of Illinois.

The revelation that professional
wrestling matches are staged hasn’t
quieted the enthusiasm of the fans
that flock to see the exhibitions on
Saturday nights at Chicago's Mari-
gold Arena.

Movle audiences know the plights
on the screen are staged, yet the
tears flow. Wrestling fans also
acknowledge that their heroes are
engaged in a mock battle. But
few types of entertainment generate
the passionate excitement that fills
the 1,000 spectators who regularly
turn out.

Ceremonlous Start

A match begins almost ceremon-
iously. Billy is a Nice Kid. He
tousles the hair of his young ad-
mirers and teen-age girls in boots
and ski pants, begging for his auto-
graph. He comes from Texas, and
anyone can tell you he must be a
good Joe.

His opponent is a German, Max.
Max is so much bigger than Billy
and any mother knows her boy
shouldn’t have to fight a bully like
that. Naturally, Max spurns Billy’s
hand.

From the first, Billy lsln trouble.
Max sneers as he gauges eyes,
laughs when he crushes Billy in a
corner.

When Max wins by forcing Billy
to give up in the clutches of a bear
hug, he struts around the ring. The
audience responds by Screamlng
“Hell” and making mock Nazi sa-
lutes.

When Billy hobbies from the ring
everyone knows he would have won
if Max had fought fair. if he’d only
had a chance — if only life was
fair, if only there i'ere chances.

Women Wrestlers

Women wrestlers stir even more ‘
passionate reactions in audiences.
When the well-built red-head in.
leopard skin enters the ring, men!
whistle and women turn away. Her}
opponent, cloaked inarobe ofmodest '
velveteen, has little makeup on and
just a touch of grey in her mousy-
brown hair. .

Children rut to her and the women f
applaud her..

As expected, the red-head fights
dirty. ller beauty vanishes as she
screams and pulls hair. When
called on a foul, she nags the ref-1
area. When the hussy goes down ini
defeat a man can turn to his plain-
looking wife reassured.

Women wrestlers have yet another
attraction -- suspense. The men
cheer less now, they lean forward
slightly, tapping their feet inces-
santly. An accident could happen -
one hasin yet, but they’ve heard of -.
it, and they don’t want to be loolt- 1
ing away if it should happen, ;

After the show, a man was 5911- 5
ing neWSpapers at the door of the '
arena. The headlines spoke of Com- 3
munist advances, of hoodlums set ,
free, of Negroes turned away from '
church services. Few boughtpapers,

For now, at least, they could think ,
that right occasionally triumps,thet '
