Golf Team Wins Match,
Defeats Oneonta Squad

The golf team usually opens its
season by playing its first match
in rain, snow, sleet or hail. Mon-
day’s opening match againstOneonta
was no exception with play being
hampered by the cold, wet weather.
The meet proceeded very slowly
under Pinehaven’s towering coni-

fers.

The last foursome had to putt on
a green lighted by a car’s head-
lights. State’s Mike Bayus and Fred

Bachorz won their matches to give
Albany 11 1/2 points to Oneonta’s

dropped their opening matches. The
final score was much closer than

L Fresh from two consecutive victories, the Varsity Baseball team faces the men
from Potsdam State, today. It will be the last home game before the Feds take to
the road. The - team has been strong at home so far in the young season, and have
won both their games. The only loss was to Siena in Loudonville. Potsdam should
' be one of the stronger teams that the Albany squad will face this year. . n
