, rials presented.

While 'it can be admitted that the
money received frOm the University
budget was ignored as it was ignored
‘ in all reports presented to Senate, this
does not remove all grounds for cri-
ticis‘m.

In saying that-we of the ASP do not
believe the Student Association should
be paying for the major productions,
we are drawing upon much factual ma-
terial which has never found its way
into the news columns of the ASP.

Just last year, the policy on the sale
of tickets to the productions encour-
aged student attendance. This was the
policy of punching tax cards in the
peristyles. Now, all tickets are sold
and students tax cards are punched in
a room on the second floor of Richard—

son.

4 The publicity of the council has been
dominated by mis-management and
waste. At least two local printers which
have been employed this year by the
publicity director are annoyed by the
inability of the director to work either
efficiently or correctly.

One incident involving the ‘wasting of
a fairly large quantity of high gloss
paper dominates the mismanagement of
this year.

If the university'is interested in good
relations with the Albany community,
certainly any attempt to obtain local‘
interest in our drama productions would
be a step in the right direction.

The plays of this year can be con-
sidered typiéal of the work done by the
drama department in the past. '

The first play of this year was Good
Woman of Setzuan- This was produced
in Page and was fairly well attended.
It was by a well-known author, al-
though the translation into English is
considered to be one of the worst. The
other plays by Brecht have been trans-
lated into more stylistic English.

This play went well over its produc-
tion budget, but was a technical master-
piece. This was followed by two pro-
ductions in the Little Theatre in Rich-

ardson.
If the productions of the drama de-

partment were financed entirely out of
ticket sales, they would be forced to
make several reforms.

As we see them. these reforms would
be

1. to select plays as good as the ones
which have always been produced, only
by authors with names which are known

     

“In:

 
  

 

 

 

  

flotitaogo _
by non-drama faculty. '

2. to publicize the playsand to sell
their own organization in a more busi-
nesslike and more professional manner.

3. to end the morally devastating, if
occasiOnal, policy of pro-casting.

There has been and there continues to
be no criticism of the productions them-
selves; ‘they are of high quality. The
criticism comes when one considers the
number of students the plays appear to
interest,

We consider that the only possible
reasons for this lack of interest are

1. the plays are of too little interest
to allow a publicity program to meet
any success, '

2. the plays are improperly publi—
cized,

3. the plays are insufficiently pub-
licized.

We wonder what effect upon attend-
ance a few changes would make. These
changes are up to the D & A Council
and S.U.T. We hope that the names
and dates of the plays can be presented
with the tax cards by this September.
There is even a chance that titles and
dates could appear in place of the num-
bers on the cards.

We believe that the D & A Council
itself has been too slow to look at its
own peculiar financial situation.

According to policies of Senate as
they now read, the budgetary support
by SA appears to be groundless. Per—
haps if the Council were to present a
plan to create a form of fiscal inde-
pendence within the SA budget, then
the support could be defended.

It is clear that as the University
grows, Senate will not continue to con—
trol the budgets in the way it does now.
A system of allocations is considered
by many to be the most likely new sys-
tem. It is our hope that D & A will at-
tempt to get Senate moving inthis direc-
tion or give up the idea of SA support
for plays which fail to provide a uni—
versal service for a universal tax.

We also hope that the members of
the State University faculty will take
some steps to find out how this insti-
tution is being treated by the state in
comparison to other units of the State
University which have dramatic pro-
grams.

If the faculty involved feel that they
must produce non—conventional theatre
almost exclusively, perhaps the D & A
budget should concentrate on bringing
in more guest plays.

As for the Campus Viewpoint, we
insist that this is this year, not last
year.

It seems that all we State students worry about is virginity and

AWS Evaluation

Worthwhile

Re-evaluation on this campus has ‘come to connote
time-wasting committees which accomplish nothing.
This is unfortunate, for re-evaluations are vital to
having effective organizations in our expanding Uni-

versity.

The Association of Women Students is undergoin

g

a re-evaluation and re-organization at this time. Its
officers are attempting to expand it to the point where
it can become an effective government for women.

The first and most important step in this re-organi-
zation is to enlist the interest and cooperation of the
women in this University. The AWS has the potential to
become a powerful and influentialorganization,but, like
any group, it can only do as much as the individual will

support it in doing.

Much discontent has been expressed in the past over
women’s hours and other such regulations. There is a
great deal to be done in making these regulations

realistic and bringing them up—to—date.
The Association of Women Students is the organiza

tion to work through in accomplishing such reforms.
It is recognized by the administration as the repre-

sentative of women residents.

Now is the time for

those who are dissatisfied with present conditions to
air their criticisms, suggestions and requests.

Current Comment

 

Convention Forecast

by Joseph W. Colo

The Republican convention will
open its first session with the“Star
Spangled Banner” and three cho-
I‘uses of “Right, We’ll Always lie”
by Robert Weich.

The keynote address Will wander
through the miraculous achievement
of the Eisenhower administration.

The nominating speeches will pre-

sent to the assemblage the namesof

Goldwater, lienry Cabot
Lodge, George liomncy, William
Scranton, Margaret Chase Smith,
and Harold Stassen. Also favorite
sons such as John Byrnes, Nelson
Rockefeller, James ll. Rhodes, Mark
llutt'ield, Robert Smylie, John A.
Love, Walter Judd, ’l‘hruston Mor-
ion, and John Anderson Will be pre—
sented.

Barry

Platform

The second session will be dom-
inated by a discussion of the longest
and vaguest platform in the nation’s
history. The vote will be 137 in
favor, 122 against and several hun-
dred abstentions.

On the first ballot, Goldwater will
come within 42 votes of winning the
nomination. Charges of fraud and
Communist influence will be heard.
Margaret Chase Smith will mis—
read her withdrawal address and
yield in favor of Stussen.

On the second ballot Goldwater
will gain 93 votes from the several
favorite sons. Much to the delight
of the Smylio-Hatfield-Low: faction,
Goldwater will lose 91 Votes he had
on the first ballot.

The result will leave Goldwater
40 Votes from victory and Peggy
(Mrs. Goldwater) announces she is
pregnant. There is an immediate
rush of four delegates to the Cold-

water cause.
The third session begins after a

night of busy iii—fighting. The third.

and fourth ballots are held with
Barry coming within -12 and then
6 Votes of the nomination.

Right Wing Author

Peggy tells MargaretChase Smith
that she (Peggy)really expects twins
and that she is going to give all
delegates in copy of the complete
Works of Ayn Rand.

’l‘Wo more delegates change their
votes to Barry and Peggy. also
known as the Fun of the Republic.

On the fifth ballot the chairman
of the Arizona delegation, shilling
and holding a red rose, announces
that Arizona cast half its votes for
Governor Fannin and the others for
Stassen. Peggy admits that the whole
thing is u fraud.

Tie Creates Confusion
The balloting ends in a four way
tie, between George Aiken, Bernard
liaruch, Winthrop Rockefeller, and

1 exiliirpll’ill‘iiidtb Iblllltlllg'the motion
to recess carries. The next day,
on the 48rd ballot, Harold Stasseu
is nominated. The organ breaks
into "Happy Days are Here Again"
and an NBC camera focuses on a
tearful Margaret Chase Smith.

On the last day of the convention,
Stassen accepts the nomination,
Stassen thanks the party for the
nation's, first genuine draft, Stassen
endorses the idea of not nominating
a Vice President in the hope of
bolstering his economy campaign,
Goldwater announces his support for
Orval Faubus for Governor of Ar—
kansas, and the delegates walk slow-
ly and quietly out of the ball as the
organist plays TchaikoVsky's
“March of the Marloneties.“
