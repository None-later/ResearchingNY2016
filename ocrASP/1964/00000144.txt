Led by Pep ammo. the
baseball team scored a5-4
victory over Utica in an
away game. last Saturday.
The win was State’s fourth

straight.

The game was hip and tuck all
the way. In the first inning Piz-
zillo singled and stole second and
third. He scored on a ground out
by Gary Smith. In the third inning
the show was again all Pizzillo:
he singled, stole second and scored
on two infield outs.

Utica was able to touch starter
Joe Mazzurulli for single runs in
the third and fourth innings. The
score remained tied 2-2 until the
top of the sixth when the Peds came
up with three runs.

Big Inning

Pizzillo walked and stole second.
Mike Putney singled, but the runner
was thrown out at the plate. Next,
Gary Smith socked a run scoring
double, and Dick Kimball, who had
relieved Mazzurulli in the fifth,
brought in Smith with a single.
Kimball reached third on a wild
pitch and scored what proved to
be the winning run on Pizzillo’s
sacrifice fly.

Utica rallied in the bottom of
the eighth to score two runs, but
Don McGurrin came on to close
the door and preserve Kimball’s
third victory.

The day before, the varsity nine
defeated Potsdam 7-5 in a home
game. The contest started slowly
with neither team scoring for the
first three innings. Then, in the
bottom of the fourth Pizzillo came

uLast Men on Campus 

 

The tension mounts as Don Woodruff, Robert Reid, and David

 

Forman wait to see it they will be the last men on campus.

0 “I can’t believe I got the room,"
exulted Donald Woodruff ’67. Wood-
ruff and his two roommates of next
year, Robert Reid and David For-
man, also freshmen, had cause for
jubilation.

They had just been assigned the
last available living quarters for
men — D-30 in Waterbury Hall.
Drawing on Reid's low number of
168, they quickly filled out the re-
quired forms and secured their
places for next year.

“For once I’ve been lucky,” For-
man grinned. Men following the trio
were not so lucky. The University
has no more room at the present
for the left-over students.

Lest students envision being
camped on dorm field next Sep-
tember, however, Miss Norma Ed-
sall, Assistant Dean of Women,
pointed out that students usually
drop out over the summer and that
empty places will be filled with the
left-overs.

F rosh Guardians Serve

Patricia Fasano and Ed-
,fyard Wolner, Juniors, have
been chosen by MYSKANIA
as the guardians of the
Class of 1968.

The role they are assuming is
substantially different lI‘OlIl that
of previous years, for Rivalry, a
major part of freshmen orientation,
has been abolished.

Under the tentative outlines ofthe
new Frosh orientation Program,
the class guardians will be charged
with organizing the incoming fresh-
men into a class.

They will direct both freshmen
and transfer students through the
initial stages of orientation, will
attempt to interest the freshmen
in University activities, and will
help to develop capable leaders.

 

Patricia Fasono and Edward Welder are the newly selected

guardians ol’the Class of 1968.

State Students to Receive Expanded

Health insurance Plan Next Your

Arthur Kapner, insur-
ance representative for the
State University of New
York at Albany, has an-
nounced a change in in—
surance coverage for stu-
dents for ’64-’65 academic

year.

As a result of a change from the
American Casualty Company to the
Consolidated Mutual Insurance
Company, Kapner said that students
will receive increased benefits for
the same premium that was in ef-
fect in ’63-'64.

Premium Stable

These rates are $18.50 for the
school year and $26.00 for twelve
months. About fifty percent of the
students now hold policies for twelve
months.

Under the present accident cov—
erage, any bills up to five hundred
dollars are paid. In addition to
paying such bills in their entirety,
the new company will pay 80% of
all bills in excess of $500 up to
$3,500 for each illness.

Hospital room and board benefits
are to increase from twelve dollars
per day for a maximum of thirty
days to eighteen dollars per day
for a maximum of thirty days.

Miscellaneous expenses that are
incurred while not confined to a
hospital will still be covered to
fifteen dollars, but miscellaneous
expenses incurred while in the hos-
pital will be paid up to $150, com-
pared to the present $60.

New Role

The guardian program for next
fall may also develop a steering
committee, composed of freshmen,
to help in the organization process.

Another possibility is to estab-
lish an information booth to answer
questions and give advice to con-
fused students in the initial stages
of orientation.

Although many aspects of orien-
tation have been changed, some
of the traditions will be kept. These
include the Beanie Ball, Parents
Day, and Homecoming Weekend.

In other business, MYSKANIA
ruled that Senate was fulfilling its
constitutional requirements. The
ruling was made as the result of
a referral made last April 15.

Tobey's referral cited the section
of the Student Association Consti-
tution which states;

“The duties and the powers of
Senate shall be: (3) to provide
for all committees to carry out
its function."

MYSKANIA ruled that the infor-
mal assent of Senate to the exec-
utives decision did indeed constitute
a fulfillrneni of its constitutional
requirements.

Yearbook Photo
Deadline Today

Today will he the lost time
members of the Class of 1965
will be able to sign-up for scri-
ior photos in next year's Torch.

Sign-up sheets will be avoii'
able in the peristyles until 3:00
pm. today.

Anyone not signing up will
not have his photograph in the
senior section of the yearbook.

 

Surgical expenses will still be
covered to the maximum amount of
$225 as will private nurse benefits.
Twelve dollars per day for up to
thirty days will be paid for twenty-
four hour-a-day nursing care.

Also remaining the same is the
payment of $4.50 per doctor’s visit
up to twenty-five visits, either at
the student’s residence or at the
office.

Ambulance expense benefits have
been increased from fifteen dollars
to twenty dollars.

The maximum payment for con-
sultant’s expenses is remaining at
thirty dollars as is the coverage
for prescribed medication which is
sixty dollars.

Maximum Benefits Rise
The major change is the total
maximum benefits that a student
can receive for any illness. Under
the present plan a student can re-
ceive only $500 maximum for each'
sickness.

The new coverage will permit a
policy holder to receive the maxi-
mum for each line under the sick-
ness benefit for each illness.

Consolidated Mutual Insurance
Company has guaranteed in writing
that the present premium will be
in force for the next two complete
school years.

Option Remains
As in past years the students
will have the option of taking the
insurance for the school year or
the entire year, and if the student
is covered by a comparable policy,

he will not be required to purchase
the policy.

 

Arthur Kapner
...Wider - Health Coverage

Kapner said that next year he is
planning to have a twenty-four hour
service for the payment of all claims
at his office, rather than the present
system where he must submit all
claims to the Boston office of the
insurance company before any,
claimant can receive his payment

It is not definite at the present
time whether or not the insurance
money will be collected with other
fees that will be prepaid before the
student returns to school in Sep-
tember.

All students will receive complete
details of the new policy and all ex-
panded benefits either before they
finish the present term or during
the summer vacation according to
Kapner.

Judd, Daniels to Co-Edit Printer

  

next year's expanded Primer.

Bruce Daniels ’65 and Robert
Judd '65 will serve as co-editors
of next year’s Primer.

'l‘lie (to-editors announce that they
plan to publish two editions of the
literary journal next year. Tents.-
tive plans call for publication in late
fall of this year and the early spring
of 1965.

This will be the first time in four
years that Primer will attempt to
publish on a semi-yearly basis. The
plan for expanding Primer was first
formulated by this year’s editor,
Joseph Gomez '64, the recent win-
ner of a Woodrow Wilson Fellow-
ship.

The new oo-editors are extremely
anxious to get the student body ill-i
terested in Primer.

  

 

Robert Judd (l) and Bruce Daniels will serve as co-editors of

  

In regards to the need for con-
tributions, co-editor Daniels said, -
“Creative expression is the life
blood of a University."

The editors have not yet formu-
lated arty definite editorial policy.
However, they do hope to run more
material of an essay nature, rather
than relying mainly on short stories
as Primer has done in the pest.

Daniels said that there is a tents:-
tive plan to itold a program With
some of the area writers saute time
in May to encourage students to
write for Primer. Plans however
are not definite.

The editors urge students who
plan to contribute to Primer to
write their pieces over the sum-
mer.
