Committee Passes D&A,

Senate Budget Committee continued its open hearings
Tuesday with passage of the Torch, Dramatics and Arts
Council, and Forum of Politics budgets. Debate was
relatively brief on these budgets in comparison to
the lengthy discussions that had centered around the
ASP and WSUA budgets in previous meetings.

Only the Torch request
for an editor’s salary of
$400 caused discussion,
resulting in the proposed
salary being cut to $200.

The committee agreed unani-
mously to cut the request. The
Torch budget was then passed at
a total of $13,840.

William Colgan ’65, newly-elected
editor of the Torch, said that he
thought the work involved and the
responsibility of the position made
a salary justified.

Colgan did admit, however, that
in his opinion, the editorship of the
yearbook would not require as much
time as the editorship of the ASP
a position he presently holds.

Student Association President
Ar hur Johnston ’65 declared that
in his opinion "$400 was too much
for the yearbook editor, but that
perhaps $200 was to little.”

Lagging Behind

Due to the length of consideration
being given to budget requests, the
committee has been unable to meet
its original schedule.

A new schedule has been compiled
by Commissioner of Finance, Arthur
Ferrari '66. All meetings will be
held in the Private Dining Room.

Tomorrow at 1:00p.m. University
,Center Association will present
their budgets.

University Commuters Organi-
zation, Fencing Society, Department
of Recreation, and Camp Board
are scheduled at 8:00 p.m. Sunday
night.

MYSKANIA, Campus Commis-
sion, Cabinet and Senate, come be-
fore the Committee &:30 p.m. nexr
Tuesday, May 5. Hearings conclude
Thursday, May '7 with SEA, and
Debate Council.

Any groups who are not finished
at their originally scheduled meet-
ings will be re-scheduled for May 7.

D 8: A Passes

Dramatics and Arts Council and
Forum of Politics budgets were
aproved at Tuesday’s meetings with
little trouble.

Dramatics and Arts Council re-
ceived a total appropriation oi
$5717.50. This represents an in-
crease of less than one hundred
dollars over last year’s appropri-
ation.

Forum of Politics received its
requested $2590. The only major
change in the Forum budget was a
jump from $1250 to $1450 in the
speaker line so that the group can
bring four major speakers to the
campus next year.

Peace Corps Group to Present

ngrwrcAnsueerNm Week

Three members of a Peace Corps
team will be on campus from Wed-
nesday, May 6 through Friday, May
8. A Peace Corps Center will be
set up in the Placement Bureau in-
terview room located in the base-
ment of Richardson Hall.
