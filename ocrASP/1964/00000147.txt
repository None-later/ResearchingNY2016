Origins of the Peace Corps

 

 

It was just past midnight on a
chilly October morning in 1960
when the young Senator from
Massachusetts mounted the steps of
the Michigan Union in Ann Arbor
and asked a group of University
of Michigan students if they were
willing to go overseas to help their
country.

“There was a bush," one ob-
server said, “and the mood of the
crowd seemed to change."

That was the first time that
John F. Kennedy publicly men-
tioned the Peace Corps. He did so
again in a nationally televised
speech a month later at the Cow
Palace in San Francisco which
brought 30,000 letters of support
for the idea.

Where did the idea «ome from?
Since the Peace Corps is now so
successful, many people have
claimed credit for originating the
idea, and many can be given credit.

The first legislation in the area
was introduced by Congressman
Henry S. Reuss (D-Wis.) in Janu-
ary, 1960. Reuss says he got the
idea in 1957 during an inspection
of the United States foreign aid
effort in Cambodia.

Reuss brought the subject of an
overseas youth corps into a speech
at Cornell University. As he later
said, “The response there—and
wherever else I have discussed it—
was electric."

Reuss's legislation —— called the
Point Four Youth Program—was
,sponsored in the Senate by the late
Senator Richard Neuberger of Ore-
gon and was added to the Foreign
Aid Authorization Act. Eventually
$10,000 was allocated to make a
study of the plan and the Agency
for International Development took
the responsibility for getting the
study done.

AID had a difficult time ﬁnding
a group willing to take the con-
tract, but ﬁnally Colorado State
University's newly founded re-
search center agreed to do it.

On June 15, I960, after Reuss‘s
proposal and before the money had

been allocated for the study, Sena-
tor Humphrey proposed that a
youth corps be set up. His legisla-
tion was the ﬁrst calling for more
than a study of the feasibility of
the idea.

The Colorado group had just ac-
cepted the contract when Kennedy
mentioned the idea at San Fran-
cisco. After he was elected, he
established the Corps on a pilot
basis by an executive order on
March 1, 196]. Congress answered
his request to set up the Corps on
a permanent basis with a bill that
President Kennedy signed into law
on Sept. 22, 196].

By the time the group had the
report out, the Peace Corps had
been going more than six months,
and the ﬁrst Volunteers were over-
seas.

How did President Kennedy get
the idea? According to George
Sullivan, who is writing a book
on the Peace Corps and spent sev-
eral months researching the origins,
Kennedy's contact with the corps
idea came from several sources.
Reuss reports that he sent his in-
formation to Kennedy in August
or September of 1960.

Among those who inﬂuenced
Kennedy in the development of the
Peace Corps program besides Ruess,
Neuberger, and Humphrey, were
Chester Bowles, Archibald Cox,
Walter Reuther, Ted Sorenscn, and
Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson had
mentioned the idea in campaign
talks even before Kennedy. Bill

director of the Corps, was a mem-
ber of Johnson's staff at that time.

The early, derisive comments
about the “Kiddie Corps" and
“Disturbing-the-Peace Corps" have
been replaced by such universal
backing that the Peace Corps gets
94 to 96 percent of its annual ap-
propriation request, which is much
better than the average for other
agencies. Peace Corps matters are
usually passed by voice vote; a roll
call vote has never been necessary.

The success of the Peace Corps
has been attributed to two things:
the fact that it is apparently a good
force for peace in the world, and
the leadership of Peace Corps
Director R. Sargent Shriver. Every-
where in Washington, Shriver is
given credit for being the man who
made the Peace Corps work.

Senator Humphrey wrote in
I961, “The effect of Peace Corps
work will be invaluable. The citi-
zen of an underdeveloped country
may forget a case of American
supplies quickly consumed: he may
resent a load of American guns
turned over to his government. But
his memory of working with and
sharing the skills of an American
citizen will be strong and endur-
ing. . .

“America's best resource
people.”

Reuss was asked his opinion of
the implementing of his idea. and
if he had any suggestions for im-
provements in the Corps.

“I think it's as close to being
perfect as anything can be."

Cooperative Effort

The Peace Corps Volunteer is
usually pictured with dirt under
his ﬁngernails, digging in the mud
to help the lowly peon plant his
crops. Actually, a large percentage
of the Volunteers are involved in
initiating a cooperative effort be-
tween people in areas where work-
ing together was unheard of before.

Community development: as this
process is called, takes place in
both villages and urban areas. It
involves three steps.

First, the Volunteer must get to
know the people and be accepted
by them. This is described by Vol~
unteers as one of their toughest
problems because it is a relatively
inactive period and they are unable
to see any tangible results from
their efforts. They may get to know
the people by talking to them in
cafes, meeting with them on -the
street or helping them in small
chores.

The ‘second phase consists of
organizing the community to hold
meetings at which local problems
are presented. This stage is also
difficult. It may take many sessions
before the Volunteer can get an
orderly meeting.

In the third and ﬁnal stage, the
Volunteer starts mobilizing the
community to work on its de-
ﬁned problem. In many foreign
countries, people are articulate and
thorough planners, but sometimes
become bored by the things they
have planned. As one Volunteer
said. “Our greatest enemy is the
‘claborate plan.‘ The idea becomes
the substitute for the work and
sweat that is really needed. We in
the United States are a country of
doors—we avoid elaborate plan-
ning and speech-making and
quickly roll up our sleeves and go
to work. Our greatest efforts as
Volunteers are spent in getting the

 

sleeves tip."

The Volunteer must gct the pco-,
pic of the country to do the work
themselves. If the Volunteer does
it himself, his time is wasted. Many:
Volunteers arrive in tin iircii, and
the villagers ask shortly. "Where

are the bulldozers?“ The Volunteer
then might tell the villager to ap-
proach his own government about
supplying a bulldozer. Thepidea is
to get the people in the area to help
themselves.

One example of a rural commu-
nity development project was a
cooperative vegetable-growing en-
terprise in Chile. A Volunteer
talked 20 families into growing
three kinds of vegetables together
and marketing them together. By
cooperating, they were able to rent
a truck to take their harvest to
town instead of each having to use
his ox-cart. The proﬁts were split
among the families with a small
amount to the cooperative to keep
it going. _

Some of the farmers made as
much from one harvest as they
made in two years working on
the large, privately owned farms
where they were employed.

Another project by the same
Volunteer involved getting a bred
sow from CARE and splitting the
resulting litter among several fam-
ilies. The female pigs in the litter
were bred, thereby producing a
litter from each female. Of this
third generation, one pig was given
to CARE to repay the original
loan, and one was given to the
cooperative.

This has been criticized in some
areas as communistic, but it is
actually the highest form of free,
private enterprise. Under commu-
nism, the state owns and controls
everything. Under the cooperative
program, the farmer owns his pigs
and treats them as his own. The
whole cooperative movement de-
veloped by the Volunteers could
be described as it process of coop«
criitivc individualism.

Whether in urban or rural areas. ‘

the Volunteer is concerned primar—
ily with getting the people to work
together. He tries to develop the

.organization of the area so that

the people will carry on after he

‘ goes home.

Corps Aids
In Cities

There are no Peace Corps Vol-
unteers working in Paris but not
many of the 7,000 members are
living in grass huts either. Many
awaken in the morning to the
sound of street cars and truck
trafﬁc.

“One of the most popular myths
about the Peace Corps," said one
official, “is that everybody is living

from the nearest city."

Nigeria refutes this point, how-
ever. Peacc Corps projects are con-
centrated in the six major cities.
Volunteers there are teaching in
secondary schools and universities.

lbaden, in the western part of
Nigeria, is exotic enough to ﬁt the
usual conception of a Peace Corps
site—it is the largest all—Negro city
in the world. Some 30 Peace
Corpsmen are teaching there in
secondary schools and universities.
Another 25 Volunteers are work-
ing in Enugu, a city of 42,000 in
eastern Nigeria.

Five hundred miles away in
Liberia, 80 of the country's 300
Volunteers are working in one
city alone—the capital, Monrovia.
Members there are engaged in all
levels of teaching; some hold pub-
lic administration jobs in the gov-
ernment.

On the other side of the Atlantic,
in Peru, the Volunteer is again
found almost as often in the city
as in the “bush.” Nearly half of
the Volunteers in Peru are in ur-
ban areas—60 in Lima alone. Sig-
niﬁcant numbers of Volunteers are
also assigned to cities in Venezuela
and Chile.

In Bolivia, there are Peace Corps
Volunteers in villages, but a recent
project sent Volunteers to supple-
ment university teaching staffs in
La Paz, Santa Cruz and set/eral
other large towns.

In Turkey, a Volunteer can ex-
pect to be sent to anything from a
rural hamlet to a town of up to
50,000 population. Living condi-
tions in any case are "fairly nice,"
according to Volunteers.

In Lagos, Nigeria, things are so
lgood that drink'mg water need not
{even be boiled.

V Most of the people on city as-
isignments are teaching, but they
1 are not trained teachers. The Peace
v‘ (‘orps does not ask that Volunteers
ihavc experience—let tilone train-
i ing. Volunteers must have a bache-
i lor‘s degree with a major or minor
lin the ﬁeld which he will teach.
l One Peace Corps official ud-
niittcd that he prefers untrained
lpotcntitil teachers because they
were more likely to have a good
tkiiowlcdge of their field and "be
‘ithlc to do other things too—like
‘ glaze windows."

In east Africa only one-third of
lthe Volttnteer teachers have had

i l’cacc (‘orpsmen in secondary
