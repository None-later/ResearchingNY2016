I —To Be A Do ’er

. i
No one who knew him at the
University of California had any
doubts about Bob Stillwell’s future.
The groundwork seemed pretty well
laid out. A degree in political sci-
ence and a handful of applications
to law schools seemed to chart a
promising future. But that was a
year ago. Today the tall, blond
Californian is not reading law at
’Harvard or Yale—he's teaching
,English to children in Nepal.
g, Bob Stillwell sidestepped the
ssecurity of the so-called aﬁluent
society to serve as a Peace Corps
'Volunteer. Thousands of young,
- well-educated Americans have been
' motivated to go half way around
the world to exotic lands to teach
English, to develop local govern-
., mental units or to participate in
,. other Peace Corps projects.

Does the Peace Corps Volunteer
have the fervent, missionary zeal?
Is he a flag-waving patriot who
'wants to tell underdeveloped peo-
, ,, ples about America's virtues? Bob
V’ ‘ Still'well‘s interest in the Peace

, Corps characterizes motives which
have led thousands of college stu-
dents to temporarily postpone their
careers for voluntary service over-
seas.

Bob StiIIWelI is a composite of
thousands of young Americans
who want to do—to participate
rather than remain detached ob-
servers. There is no real Bob Still-
well, but there are hundreds of
Volunteers with similar back-
grounds and desires. He Wants to
help people in developing coun-
tries learn the skills that have made
the US. a powerful industrial
nation.

The Peace Corps can foster bet-
ter international relations. It is a
way to work for peace and to be an
intimate part of the progress of a
developing nation, the tall Califor-

' nian maintains.

Bob and his colleagues are not
caught up in any desire to Amer-
icanize others. His expressions of
patriotic feelings show a broad con-
cern for strengthening the United
States in its relations with other
countries. He’d like to improve the
US. image abroad.

There is something fresh and
genuine about the enthusiasm of
other Volunteers who trained with
Bob. They ranged from a student
of East Asian affairs who is writ-
ing his Ph.D. dissertation on the
economic development of Nepal
to an elderly grandmother who
wants her children to live in a
peaceful world.

He wants to apply his knowledge

‘ of English and inter-personal rela-
tions to another culture. He wants
to gain inter-cultural experience,
general knowledge and personal
satisfaction through Peace Corps
service.

Bob emphasizes a spirit of co-
operation. He has no desire to go

overseas to “help people" per se.
He says he wants to work with the
people, to motivate them to put
into practice some of the principles
which the Corps is pushing.

Service in the Peace Corps, Bob
believes, will be an attractive asset
on anyone’s credentials. You have
to have a certain amount of drive
and stamina in order to stand up
'under'the pressures which we face.
It is a real experiment in self-
knowledge.

Not all of Bob’s colleagues share
in the scope of his altruistic out-
look. Some Volunteers in Nepal
and elsewhere are not particularly
concerned with spreading democ-
racy or combatting communism,
but are more interested in travel-
ing abroad and applying their
knowledge. It is also an opportu-
nity, as one agricultural worker put
it, “to identify with something big-
ger than we are ourselves."

Bob has many of the qualities
of the most successful kind of
Peace.Corps Volunteer. He is no
wild-eyed idealist, neither is he a
resigned pragmatist. He is both
self-motivated and socio-mbtivated.
He has a strong belief in the Peace
Corps. He wants to build a better
world and to change the American
image. By the same token, he wants

The United States is not the only
country with a program to train
volunteers for work in the social
and economic development of
countries in Latin America, Africa,
and Asia.

The 13 national volunteer pro-
grams now underway vary in the
amount of government support they
receive, but all are characterized
by a goal of putting young people
into developing countries.

The Canadian University Serv-
ice Overseas, for instance, is a pri-
vately ﬁnanced organization which
has .placed 160 volunteers in some
30 countries. Most are secondary
school teachers, youth workers, ru-

ral development specialists and
medical personnel.
In South America, Argentina

has begun training a group of 50
teachers to be placed in neighbor-
ing countries through the Organi-
zation of American States. The Ar-
gentine program is being ﬁnanced
by the government.

The Scandinavian countries are
also involved in aiding the less
industrialized nations. Denmark's
program. called Dansk Ungdoms
U-Landsarvejde, sent its ﬁrst group
of eight volunteers to Tanganyika
last September and other volun~
teers are in traiping. Norway and
1Sweden are also in the early stages

The Volunteer ’s Motive

to work with people, to enjoy per-
son-to-person contact, to teach, to
apply his speciﬁc skills, to gain an
inter-cultural experience, to learn
and to further his own career.

Like most good Peace Corps
Volunteers, Bob is quite speciﬁc
about what contributions he hopes
to make and he is not at all shy
about what he expects in return.
He sees the Peace Corps as a
service organization with a pri-
mary function of helping the less
fortunate.

There are Bob Stillwells at every
college and university in the coun-
try. They all have similar motives
which allow them to make the tran-
sition from four years of books
and collegiate social life to aiding
people in a developing country.

They are endowed with a cer-
tain kind of enthusiasm, vigor and
verve. They live by strong personal
convictions: seeking to serve oth-
ers in the service of their country.
They have a desire to learn another
culture in depth. They want to
travel and to combine adventure
with education. They want to
broaden their perspectives in a
mature fashion. They want to chal-
lenge their strength and ingenuity.
And they were in the chorus that
answered President Kennedy.

 

Other Countries Begin
Peace Corps Program

of planning and training programs.

By the end of 1962, international
volunteer programs were consid-
ered important enough so that 43
nations gathered in Puerto Rico to
discuss the future of the idea. They
formed 'the International Peace
Corps Secretariat to increase the
supply of volunteer assistance avail-
able to the developing countries.

The Secretariat has ofﬁces in
Washington.

While the International Secre-
triat concentrates on developing
foreign service programs, it also
assists developing countries to form
their own national youth organiza-
tions for domestic work. Through
these efforts El Salvador now has
60 volunteers working beside U.S.
Peace Corps members in that coun-
try.

Other countries with volunteer
programs underway include Aus-
tralia, Belgium, France, Germany,
Netherlands, New Zealand, and
Great Britain.

Now Call For

Secretaries

The Peace Corps needs 100 ex-
perienced secretaries to serve as
Volunteers in overseas Peace (‘orps
‘oilices as chief secretaries and oilice
managers.

A director and subordinate staff
members are assigned to each of
the countries in which Volunteers
are working. They are responsible
for the activities of all Volunteer
programs. In their assignments, the
secretaries will have contact with

‘Over My Dead Body’

 

Pacifying Parents Poses
Recruiting Problem

“Over my dead body!"

That was the reaction of one
parent when his daughter expressed
a desire to join the Peace Corps.

Dispelling fears and misconcep-
tions of parents such as this is pro-
viding a new communications chal-
lenge for the Peace Corps staff.

The Peace Corps staff is giving
increased attention to the need to
keep parents informed of the Corps’
operations and objectives as well as
providing them with an awareness
of the speciﬁc conditions which
their sons and daughters can ex-
pect in the ﬁeld once they become
Volunteers.

“Objections from parents causes
some Volunteers considerable psy-
chological strain and in some cases
may even keep potentially good
Volunteers out of the Corps," ac-
cording to Dr. Joseph Colincn,
Peace Corps research director.

"Many parents," (‘olnien says,
“are not aware that the Peace
(‘orps can be a positive factor in
a person's total development. in
their minds, two years in the field
is an unnecessary interruption of'
the student's career,"

('olincn believes that there is an
element of anxiety about the tin-
known some parents don‘t quite
understand why their son or daugh-
ter Would want to spend two years
of his or her life in a developing
country. This kind of isolation pro—
vides an unhealthy environment for
both physical and mental health,
some parents believe.

Many parents' initial responses
to the Peace (‘orps spring from a
reservoir of inisinf'oriiiation which
inevitably includes the mud hut
image. As one Peace (‘orps oflicial

lput it, “the parent sees his young

 

daughter in some remote village,
ﬁghting exotic tropical diseases,
isolated from civilization, hungry,
tired and scared."

A special message to parents has
been prepared to dispel many of
the misconceptions about the Corps.

The message makes it clear:

0 That Volunteers are not placed
in work sites where the health haz-
ards are so great that real dangers
are posed;

0 That living conditions are
modest, but adequate, and not often
sub-standard slum-like conditions;

0 That Volunteers are never
more than a few hours from tele-
communications services;

0 That Volunteers are not
placed in any country where a rec-
ord of instability poses an apparent
danger, and that if the need should
arise an emergency evacuation is
available in every country;

0 That the Corps ofl'ers long
range intellectual development ad-
vantages and is an asset, not a
liability, to an individual's career

The concern for parents' aware-
ness in no way undermines recog-
nition ol' the Volunteer as n nurture
and independent individual. The
message to parents is given to each
potential Volunteer after he makes
the initial application. It is up to
the student whether he wants to
give it to his parents—die may just
use it to arichr questions and clear
up doubts in his parents‘ minds.

Men like Dr. (‘olinen and his
colleagues at the Peace ('orps be-
lieve that by providing iiill infor—
motion to parents a new spirit of
co-operation and understanding will
result among those involved both
directly and indirectly in the Peace
Corps

Elena Criticizes flock Wallaby NAACP, CORE leaders in Drive
For Negro Civil Rights, Equality

Editor’s Note: Reprinted below is
a clipping from the April 24 issue

of the Stone News, the student news-
paper of Sierra College. The editor
of the Slono News, Edward lien-

niger has some cutting remarks
about the ASP; cartoon series Rock
Wolloby Hunt and about the ASP';
supposed lack of responsibility in
printing the cartoon.

We like Rock Wallaby and have
every intention of continuingto print
this creation of Tim Atwell ’66.
We think Rock Wallaby levels some
much needed barbs at some in-
stitutions that have needed a little
gentle piercing for a long time.

Below the Siena clipping is the
latest of Rock Wolloby’s reflections
on the absurdity of the human animal.
We would appreciate hearing what
you think of this cartoon series.

 

ASP Cartoon Shows Poor Taste

The following cartoon appeared in the Albany Student Press
(March 20, I964 issue). newspaper of State University in Al-
bany. We did not think it very funny.

To Editor-in- Chief William S.
Colgan: Evidently, you have no' idea
whatsoever of what the duties of an

cult for a person of your obvious

by Karen Collison

America’s Negro today is taking
slow but positive strides toward
social and political equality with
his white neighbor.

This progress could have been
slower and more discouraging than
it seems at times, now, had he not
gained the active support of large
numbers of responsible Negro and
white citizens througii organizations
like NAACP and CORE.

Helping lead the civil rights move-
ment, these two groups stand high
in public esteem for the rational,
non-violent methods of protest they
have advocated and successfully
used.

Newcomers

Viewed in perspective ofthe whole
Negro protest against segregation,
which dates from colonial times,
NAACP and CORE have come late
in their development as effective
forces. Before 1900, progress was
negligible.

In fact, there was no organized
mass movement as such... only
sporadic individual attempts,
dwarfed in their influence against
a wall of Southern hostility, North-
ern indifference, and impotent fed-
eral laws.

Partial, token emancipation was
granted the Negroes in 1863, and
Union victory assured them of total
freedom, as followed in the 13th,
14th and 15th Amendements. Still,
Southern states found ways to evade
these laws, as with the “grand-
father clause.”

Only Half-Free

Reactionary Southern groups,
such as the Ku Klux Klan, nursed
along white hatred for the Negro.
The Negro found himself Worse off
than before the war. He was half-
slave and half-free.

The Supreme Court helped pro—
long the Negro’s separation from
the white when it sanctioned “sep-
erate but equal” public facilities
in 1896. Even the government and
the armed services remained seg-
regated.

Lynching, spurred on by growing
racist sentiment in the U. 8., reached
its peak between 1889 and 1899.
Some 187 lynchings ayear occurred,

the majority of them victimizing
the Negroes in the South.

NAACP Formed
An increasing realization by pro-
gressives like Julius Rosonwald of
the need for organized protest led

to the formation of the National As-,

sociation for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP) in 1909.

NAACP began with a crusade
against lynching, in 1910. Part of
its tactics included what Woodrow
Wilson later called “pitiless pub-
licity,” directed against the lynch-
ers. The results: in 1909, there
were 90 lynchings, 65 in 1920, 25
in 1930, 5 in 1940, and none in
1950, a tangible tribute to the ef-
forts of NAACP.

School Dosogrogotlon

Their next job was aimed at Negro
‘poinicai equality, including the right
to vote. NAACP achieved a great
deal of this through the Supreme
Court.

Between 1918 and 1948, for in-
stance, lt brought 27 cases involving
the rights of Negroes before the
Courts, and won 24 of them. Their
victories included overthrow of the
“grandfather clause" and the dis-
criminatory White Primary.

One of the more impressive
battles won by NAACP was its drive
for desegregation of public schools,
beginning in 1936 and culminating
in 1954 with the Supreme Court de-
cision in Brown vs. Board of Edu-
cation of Topeka. Here, the Court
ordered schools to integrate “with
all deliberate speed.”

However, NAACP’s battle was not
entirely won, for the deep South
condemned the decision and per-
sisted with segregation. Little Rock
was the climax of this resistance
in 1957.

Impressive Leadership
NAACP today is one of the rec-

ognized leaders in the civil rights‘

movement. While it started out with
and impressive white backing, in-
cluding Jane Addams, John Dewey,
Lincoln Stephens, Ray Stannard
Baker, and Lillian Wald, Negroes
have taken an increasingly prom—
inent part in NAACP.

Modeling its action on principles
of non-violence, NAACP believes in

fighting through the courts, the bol-
lots, and the boycott.

CORE Moro Militant

Also dedicated to non-violence,
yet believing in more direct action,
is the younger, more militant group,
Congress of Racial Equality (CORE).
Founded in 1942 by James Farmer,
CORE is credited with invention of
the sit-in and the freedom ride.

At its outset, CORE was aninter-
racial, urban movement restricted
largely to the North.

Today CORE is of a decisively
changed character. Its scope has
broadened into that of amass move-
ment, and it seems to be taking
over the leadership which NAACP
held for so long.

The more radical and faster-
moving of the two movements, it
appeals to a younger set of people
than NAACP. its membership is
almost totally Negro. CORE has
made the South its major area of
concern, as it dramatically dem-
onstrated in the 1961 Freedom
Rides.

Probably the most imaginative
of the civil rights groups, CORE
does not restrict all its activities
to direct action.

Opinion Surveys

They also include publicity
through novel press releases, let-
ter-writing campaigns to govern-
ment officials and business owners,
and petitions, as the one in Wash-
ington, D. C. protesting segregation
of the public parks.

CORE has also conducted opinion
surveys to discover whether cus-
tomers object to being served by
Negro sales clerks in department
stores.

To attribute all the Negro’s suc-
cess to date, or all his set-backs,
to the NAACP and CORE alone
would grossly oversimplify and dis-
tort the total picture. For the
gains which NAACP and CORE have
achieved were possible only with
the support of public opinion and
the government.

Other equally important civil
rights groups, such as the Urban
League and the Student Non-violent
Coordinating Committee (SNCC),
must share the credit.

From the campuses across the
nation comes these groans and grins:
Next?

Says the DePuulia, De Paul Uni-
versity, Chicago:

We don’t know whether anyone
else remembers, but a few years
ago, Sid Caesar did a spoof on
rock-and-riot music by forming a
group called “The Haircuts.”

His purpose was simply to amuse
people, but he jarred many into a
realization that his pompadoured,
hip-waving satire was not far from
the truth.

Today, Caesar’s parody would
almost seem tame. lie might even
be taken seriously.

The maelstrom which has in the
past few years spewed up such
favories as Elvis, Frankie Avalon,
Fabian and Chubby may have giVen
the last full measure of devotion
in producing the Beatles. Who or
what could possibly follow them?

Nature has refined the genus gui-
tai'ius inalodorous by careful se-
lection until only the Beatles re-
main. What greater travesty? The
great "teen" music boom must
certainly die with them.

Unless, of course, somewhere a
group of four young girls who play
the zitlier, mandolin, halalaika and
harp have shaved their heads.

Every day, letters arrive without
names, with pseudonyms or with
requests that names be withheld if
the letter is published, says the
Daily Orange, Syracuse University.

Recognizing that there are oc-
casional reasons for withholding
names, we publish the letters. But
a policy of not printing unsigned
letters must be maintained for the
greater part of the letters to the
editor.

Among the anonymous letters re-
ceived here was one from a person
not liking our sports coverage, since
his best friend was not mentioned in
the copy. One letter writer did not
like the food in university dormi-
tories but did not see the picket or
boycott as the answer.

One mother - again, anonymous
-— didn't approve of the Greek sys-v
tem and saw no reason for the uni-
versity to uphold such a decrepit
system.

And colorful comments have b’eep
received from “Disgusted Stu-
dents,” “Dislilusioned Greeks,”
“Socrates,” and “Johannes Cima-
cus."

There have been graduate stu—
dents who disagree with the teach—
ings of professors but failed to Sign
their names for fear of losing pos—
sible assistantships.

The failure of such writers to
Sign letters is not indicative of the
courage shown by many who do sign
letters and write good ones.
