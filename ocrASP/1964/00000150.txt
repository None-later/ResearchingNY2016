Albany State's baseballers
get another crack at arch
rival Siena. In the first
encounter this season the
' Indians came out on top in
a twelve inningthriller 4-3.
Ray Weeks will again be
the starting pitcher for
Albany; Ray wentthe entire
distance last time and in

.the process hurt his arm.
Weeks has. not been able to pitch

effectively since the opening game, .

although he has appeared as a pinch
hitter. Should Ray's arm falter,
Coach Burlingame Would call on
either Dick Kimball or Don Mc-
Gurrin.

Kimball 3-0

Kimball has won three games in
relief, while McGurrin pitched a
nice game against Oneonta to notch
the other victory.

Dick Odorizzi, last year’s MVP
is again leading the team hitting
with a healthy .400. Pep Pizzillo
is next in line knocking the apple
at a .318 clip. Plzzillo has been

a demon onthe basepaths and has
copped seven bases is seven at-
tempts. g

Co-Captain Gary Smith'has been
consistent in his hitting and is right
on the .300 mark. Hot hitting Don
Mason, who started the year on the
bench and has since broken into

the lineup, was hit on the elbow
by a pitched ball in- battingpractice.
He has responded to treatment and
is respected to, be ready for Fri-
day's encounter.

Mason Hitting .444
Mason has been used inﬁght-

field and as a pinch hitter this
year and is hitting .444 in part
time duties.

In the first Siena game State
left sixteen men on base. Today
they hope to use their explosive
hitting and fleet running to better
advantage.

HAMMING

IT UP

by Ion Hamilton

With the big game of the season scheduled to be
played today, the number of people that have passed
through the turnstyles is reaching an all~time high.
Not wanting to disagree with the all~knowing Common
Staters that claim the students are apathetic, it is
a definite fact that more students have watched the

baseball team in action in
before.

the first games than ever

It could be that our winning team is the reason for
the increase in attendance, but the Mets are drawing
some tremendous crowds and we need not discuss their
ability to win. The sight of blankets on the third base-
line and full bleachers are certainly pleasing to the

team.

The fans have been duly rewarded for their loyalty
by some rather colorful plays. Where else can you
find a ball player that has more bunt singles than
Mickey Mantle, or where can you find two infielders
that have become starting pitchers. How many out-
fielders are there that can gun in, out, to the left,
then right, dive for the ball and have it go over his
head by ten feet all in one play.

Color is the middle name of this team. Those of you
that have not had a chance to see this crew in action
have really missed something. They can play pretty

fair baseball, despite the

moments of comedy. It

would be worth your while to take in the show. Take
a little time out from TGIF and get your bods over to

the Siena vs. State game.

Question of the Week: Can Hamilton’s predictions

destroy organized gambling?

V State’s compulsion to steel is nipped by a good throw lrom the

catcher.

Today's Siena baseball game has
been designated as a fund raising
exibition game. The collection will
be taken from the fans present to
raise money to send ateam to Tokyo

This team will be made up of
college athletes and their purpose
will be to play exibition games
in Tokyo in the hope that it will
stimulate enough interest to have
baseball as an Olympic sport. To
date the team sport of baseball is
not part of Olympic competition.

Golfers Win, As

Albany State’s varsity
golf team fresh from a
victory over Plattsburgh
State, last Wednesday,
takes on Hamilton’s team
today. Hamilton was the
only team to hand the Peas
a loss last year and they
are considered to be just
as rough this year.

Coach Sauers felt that the team
has a chance to have a perfect
season if they can getpastlianillion.
Both teams have the same learns
back this year, with the eXizepiion
of Hamilton's number one man.
Sauers was quick to point out that
it was not the first man that gave
them the trouble last year, but the
number six man. He shot even par
in the match.

The weather man was uncoopera-
tive last year and the match was
played in a down pour. it could
make a difference either way if
the skies are clear. The team is
now 4-0.

Bayus Furs 69

Mike Bayus, State's number two
two man, caught fire at Pineiiaven
on the last nine holes and shot the
lowest round for State this year,
69. Touring the front nine in 38,
he roared home in 31 for his 69.

The team won the match 15 1/2—
5 1/2 with three players shooting
sub eighty rounds. Fred Maurer
and John Vriiak carded respectable
75’s and Doug Morgan chipped in
with a ’77. All four men won their
matches and liayus captured medr
allot honors.

on Bob Barrette doubled to left
center and the game was over.
Also in League I the Saris nipped
the KB team 5-4. This game was
won in the early innings and the
last few innings were mostly de-
fensive.

League ll

In. League II the Discussors
downed KB 18-6 in a wild game, in
which the winners completely con-
trolled the game. In another game
TXO hung on for a 19-18 victory
over APA as the losers had two
men on in the last of the seventh
but could not bring them home for the
victory. It was an exciting finish
as APA, behind by fifteen runs
stormed back with fourteen in the
last two innings to make it a close
finish.

In League III action, the One-
Eyes found their hitting eyes as
they trounced the Fneurds 17-2 in
a wild and wooiey game.

The First League with a few
close so far looks as if it will
be as close and tight as it was
last year. It seems as if SLS will
come out on top again as long as
Bob Hart stays healthy and as long
as the sun keeps shining.

Representatives of three
major religious groups in
the capital district have
met to discuss the possi-

Nébillty of constructing an
Inter—faith Center for the

new campus.

Since the Univerle has estab—
lished a policy prohibiting the use
of campus facilities lill' religions
worship services, the Albany Jew—
ish Community, Council, the Capitol
Area Council of Churches, and the
Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany
have decided that such a matter is
of urgent significance.

Land Sought

As teiiini.voiy considered, such
a “center” would be constructed
on land adjacent to the new cani—
pus and Would provide a place of
Worship for all religious groups,
and Would provide office space for
the liliiilb’lel‘ti, priests, rabbis, and
other clergy assigned to the college
community

It was also felt that ibis Inter—
faith 'iieiilal‘ might contain a student

lounge and a library.

The Board of College Work of the
Capitol Area Council of Churches
has ul present boon designated to
explore the possible sights avail-
able. The number of such locations
available is limited and while 2 or
3 have been considered, “nothing
definite has been decided upon."

While this committee is at pres—
ent under the auspices of the above

it is concerning itself with plans
for a center that would be used as

religious groups.

The Committee has been con~
Widening the Work of such well
known architects as lielluschi,Cor—

Need is Greater

"The need for such a center is
unquestionable," commented ltev-
ei'end Frank Snow," the new cam-

ences as the then Albany Normal
School from 1874-1882.

According to the terms of the
will the interest deriving from the
grant will be dispensed to deserving

miitee.

Dr. Evan R. Collins, President of
the University, Dr. Paul C. Lemon,
Chairman of the Department ofBio-
logy, Dr. Donald S. Allen, Chairman
of the Department of Chemistry,
and Dr. Charles L. Andrews, Chair-
man of the Department of Physics.

The will also stipulated that the
committee appoint a student or stu-
dents to receivé cash awards and
determine whether the same shall
be awarded annually or at more
frequent or less frequent intervals.

radius."

The nearest ltomun Catholic
church is more than a mile away.
The nearest Protestant church is
also more than a mile d slant and
both are oiily accessible via ii busy
highway with no sidewalks,

It was also pointed om that while
this possible center Would be used
for worship services, the various
religious organizations which are
now active on campus would con—
tinue working on campus.
