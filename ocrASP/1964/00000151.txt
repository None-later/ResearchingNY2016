VPiotcst Against Ticket Will“

We learn with much pleasure that the
crime rate in Albany during this past
year showed a marked decrease from
the totals chalked up in 1962.

Rapes in 1963 decreased from ten to
three from the precious year. No mur-

' ders, and only three manslaughter
charges were levied during the period.

Cases of grand theft decreased from
52 to 46, while the felonies dropped
to 714 from 732.

This is a compliment to the valient
police department of Albany and the
efficient way in which they go about
enforcing the laws of America’s second—
oldest continuously inhabited city.

While complimenting Albany’s finest,
however, we would also like to make
a few minor reservations - after all
even the FBI has its critics.

We would just like to know why the
cars of Albany State students seem to
have an unwritten “open season” placed
on them year round? Rare indeed is
the State car owner who has not felt
the wrath of Albany’s numerous versions
of Troody and Muldoon.

A fairly recent example sticks in our
mind. .

There are nice big no-parking signs
all over Washington Park which nobody
bothers to obey due to the traffic con-

gestion in the city during the late after-
noon hours. _

A whole line of cars was parked
along one of the Washington Park road-
ways, and a State student who should
have known better, joined the group
and parked along with the other cars.

He made the fatal blunder of having
a student parking lot ticket on his
rear bumper.

Needless to say when he returned he
was ticketed to the tune of five dollars,
while the other cars in the row remained
unscathed.

Other examples of these dual standards
for State students can be found every
day in the week.

Any student who is foolish enough
to obtain a parking sticker is taking
check-book in hand, so to speak, when—
ever he parks anyplace in Albany ex-
cept the safe confines across from
Draper Hall.

Albany’s finest have proven them—
selves reasonably adept at maintaining
law and order in the city (we will not
go into all the details as to how they
accomplish this).

We suppose this question is all rather
naive, but we ask anyway: “Why aren’t
the Albany police fair in dispensing
tickets.”

New Publicity ilevices Needed

Whenever an individual or organization
wishes to publicize any event, approval
must be sought from Campus Commis-
sion. Upon the granting of this approval,
a poster may then be hung on some wall
of either the main buildings or annexes.

Our University is constantly expand-
ing. It has neared the point now that
communication by poster is inadequate.
Many students spend the greater part
of their college career in the annexes,
for example, ,and one or two postered
displayed in the main college buildings
do very little good in bringing events
to their attention.

The new campus points out the need
for more efficient and expansive pub-
licity. It is clear that the poster system
in a large university does not fulfill
the communications needs of the various
active organizations.

Campus Commission is in need of a
revamping on this and other scores.
For example, it supposedly is on the
alert for parking violations in the student
parking lot. On this score the Commis-
sion needs to exercise greater powers
of surveillance.

going to
completed complexes scheduled for
occupancy in September.

We feel'that as our collegiate com-
munity is a necessity. Its primary func-
tion should be one of helpful guidance
and promotion of student activities.

Only with greater interest and atig’nt-
ening up in organizational policies can
an effective Commission ever be es-
tablished.

Suites Not Sweet

For months now, word has been cir-
culating concerning the luxurious living
to be found next year at the New Cam-
pus. Pictures of large, airy rooms,
study lounges and semi-private baths
have provided the impetus for new cam—

pus preference in housing.
.A close look was taken of the actual

progress thus far. It is true that only
estimations were possible because the
basic shell and plumbing of the first
few floors only, were visible. From
these observations, the rooms look a

good deal smaller than reported.

One thing for sure, Nirvana is not

Dems Chances Good
For Next State Elections ) o

by Joseph W. Galu

In 1954, the Democrats were of-
ferred their first real opportunity
to regain the governorship. Just
two years before, the Democrats
had not campaigned for Stevenson
and Eisenhower had carried the
state by a huge margin.

Also iii 1952, the Detnocrats ran
a Borough President front New York
City for the United States Senate.
This tttatt, Cashmere, was a drab
conservative. 'l‘his personality
matched his opponent, Irving M.
vas, and Ives won by tttore than a
tttillion Votes.

In 1953 Robert I“. Wagner defied
the party bosses iii New York City,
including Cashmere, and decided to
oppose their choice, Impelliteri.

Itt this year, the Democrats Won
the ittayorulty. Thus they regained
it frottt Itnpellitcri, who although a
Democrat ran oil the Experience
party ticket.

It was in this way that the Demo-
crats were optimistic about the
1.054 gubernatorial race. Dewey
announced he would not seek a
fourth term, attd the discussion
of candidates began.

The Democrats were faced with
active candidactcs for W, Averill

velt, Jr. Mayor Wagner was also
being considered.
