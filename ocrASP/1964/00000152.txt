by Mike Gilmartln

‘ clas itchin of John Botticelli. the Siena Indians topped the var-

Weeks was plagued by a porous defense that allowed six unearned runs to.be
scored. In the season’s opener Weeks had dropped an eleven inning 4-3 decisron
to Siena at Loudonvii-le. As is always the case when these two arch-rivals compete,

Meanwhile, Botticelli set down the
Peds in order in the first two inn- '

first hit in the third. However, he
was stranded on third as Botticelli
bore down to retire the side.

Siena went out in order in both

the batters hitting the ball in the
air for easy putouts. In the last

to reaching pay dirt. Co-captain
Dick Odorizzi led off with a single;

ing and the score stood l—O going

Facing arch-rival Hamilton College last Friday, the
varsity golf team pulled out a last minute 4 1/2-4 1/2

split decision. Paul Bachorz, the last man to finish,

was faced with the task of obtaining the tie for State.

Hamilton was the only team that was able to defeat

Albany’s linksmen last year.

With smooth-swinging Mike Bayus
playing in the number one position,
and long-hitting Fred Maurer at
number two, the State duffers took
the first three points of the match.
Bayus and Maurer defeated Hamil-
ton’s two top golfers, Leon Kantor
and Bill Tracy, by large margins.

The tide then seemed to be turn-
ing against the Peds as Doug Mor-
gan and John Vrtiak both lost close
decisions. With the match dead-
locked at 3-3, the contest was to
be decided in the last foursome
where Stan Rosen and Paul Bachorz
needed two out of three points for
State to win the match.

Rosen won his match to gain one
point. Bachorz was one stroke down
going to the eighteenth hole. He
won the eighteenth with a five foot
putt on the slippery Hamilton green.
With that putt Bachorz notched a
tie for the day’s proceedings.

Mike Bayus shot a 72 for medalist
honors while Fred Maurer fires a
73.

State had an easier time against
Marist College of Poughkeepsie on
Saturday. The entire team swept
18 points out of a possible 18.
Morgan and Rosen both had 72 to
share medalist honors.

State now has an unblemished
5-0-1 record. The team feels that

Rac’queteers Extend Win Streak

by Joe Silverman

By defeating St. Peter’s College
of New Jersey 5-1 last Friday, the
varsity tennis team extended their
undefeated record to 6—0. Since
the team won enough points iiisiiigle
competition to cliticlt the riiatcb,
the doubles were not played.

John Barthelmes won his first
set 6-2 but his opponent Greg Drum-
moiid battled back to win the match
2-6, 61-, 6-2. Tom Slocum’s steady
play defeated Warren Orlando 4-6,
6-3, 6-1. John Sturtevant won his
match against Frank Wirth by a
default.

Keith Costello captured a 6-4,
8-6 victory over John Wefrig in a
closely contested match. Bill En-
ser continued his winning ways by
downing Dennis Corbett 6-4, (3-3.
Enser has not been defeated in the
six matches he has played this
season. Ed Wolner coasted to a
6—3, 6—3 victory over Dave Gullu-
gher.

Earlier in the week the Peds
topped Siena 7-2 and Oneonta 6-3

tively. In singles contests eleven

bany but the racqueteers had diffi-
culty in doubles play as they lost

Announcement of the re—
sults of the recent replace-
ment elections was firston
the agenda of Wednesday
night’s Senate meeting. A
motion was
passed to consider the re-
sults which are automat—
ically valid.

The results of the freshman class
were unique. Never before has a
tie arisen in Senate elections. The
tie occurred betWeen Laur Kurz
and James Malloy. Right now there
is no provision in the Senate Voting
Procedure for deciding a tie.

President Johnston announced that
there will probably be a run off
election between the two leading
candidates.

Sophomore elections resulted in
the selection of Linda Etheridge
in the post of class Secretary.

Alex Delfini won the Senate seat
which was open in the Junior class.

Peace Corps Spokesmen

The regular meeting was sus—
pended for a time during which
three Peace Corps Volunteers spoke
of their experiences in the Corps.
One of the speakers was Betty
Duba, a graduate of State several
years ago. She served with the
Corps in Jamaica.

Mr. and Mrs. Bresee were the

other two speakers. They had both

served in Western Nigeria:
e
Firemen

The three related valuable in-
formation in the form of actual
experiences, etnotions, and reac-
tions that affected them in their
service.

They are part of a large group
of volunteers and Corps staff mem-
bers who are going to many cam-
puses across the nation to bring
more personal information to per-
spective volunteers.

Following this talk, which in-
cluded a question period, Senate
returned to the scheduled agenda.
Udo Guddat ’66, chairman of Bud-
get Committee began the Standing
Committee reports.

Budgets Passed

Senator Guddat reported that sev-
eral budgets including Primer, Mu-
sic Councii, Debate Council, Art
Council, UCO, MYSKANIA, Fencing
Socrety, Campus Commission, Cab-
inet, and Senate budgets have been
passed by the Committee with a
few minor changes in some.

Guddat announced that a salary
of $500 was authorized by Budget
Committee. A motion to create a
salary of $200 for the S. A. Vice
President was defeated.

IFG was given an amount which
constitutes the difference between
their income and expenditure for
the years 1957-1962. This money
had been re-absorbed by Surplus
at the end of each fiscal year.

It was announced by Senator Bob
Gable ’66 that there will be a
meeting of Government Reorgani-
zation and Senate Rules Commit-
tees jointly on Tuesday afternoon

at 4 p.m. This will provide an
opportunity for both committees to
straighten out any OVerlapping leg-
islation thus far created.

The joint revision of Senate Rules
will be presented on the Senate floor
next week.

WAA Constitution

Senator Gene Tobey ’65, chairman
of the Organizational Recognition
Committee presented the constitu-
tion of WAA. However, discussion
developed concerning legal form.
It was unknown whether the status of
WAA as part of the Department of
Recreation had any bearing on the
issue of a separate constitution of
WAA.

The Outing Club Budget was then
discussed. The club wishes to be
severed from the Department of
Recreation, and wants its own budget
to be considered. Final decision on
the budget was postponed until next
week.

The next meeting of Organiza-
tional Recognition will take place
on Friday evening at 7:30.

Dippikill Trip

Tobey related details concerning
a trip to Camp Dippikill by eight
members of the University to sur—
vey the camp for future facilities.

President Johnston submitted the
name of Sue Nichols '66 to fill the
now vacant post of University Song-
leader.

Johnston also presented names
for appointment of Election Com-
mission. These will be voted on at
the next meeting.

‘Battle’ Incinerator at Sayles

Albany Fire Department sends one of its finest engines in response to the alarm from Sayles.

Fire engines screamed iitto the
driveWay at Sayles late Sunday night
in response to the second “fire”
the women's residence has exper-
ienced iii the past month.

As with the first such occur-
rence, there was no cause for alarm,
but if. was half an hour before peace
returned to the residence quad-
rungle.

The trouble came just after the
dorm closed at 11:00 p.m. when a
pipe casing on the furnace appar-
ently blew oft, sending a shoWer of
sparks and soot up through the
chimney.

Miss Eleanor Smalley, director
and business manager of the doriit,
called the fire department as a
safety precaution. It was notdeenied
necessary to have the girls leave
the building.

Five or six of the firemen went
itito the dorm and up the three
flights of stairs to the roof. They
inspected the chimney and tirade
sure that the sparks had not ignited
the roof.

Mrs. Inez Aubrey, housetiiothei‘,
and the iiesulent Assistants re—
mained ill the trails urging the girls
to return to their rooms.

Comparative calm reigned in the
dorm, and several girls actually
slept through both the explosion and
the fire department.

Outside, however, it was a dif-
ferent story. Upoit hearing the fire
sirens, the men of nearby Water-
bury rushed onto the law and ex-
pressed their great concern be-
cause the girls were not being
evacuated.

Some disappointment was also to
be found in Sayles. One girl mourned,
“All Frosh Weekend they told us to
mingle. Now, when we get a chance,
they won't let us.”
