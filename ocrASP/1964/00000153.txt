Warld’s” Fair

Statesman travel to the Worlds Fair this weekend to perform of flu New State Pavilion.

The Statesman, SUNY at Albany’s
all-male singing group, will repre-
sent the University at the New York
World’s Fair tomorrow in a special
two performance concert.

The twenty-five man group will
present two half-hour performances
at 5:00 and 8:80 pm. in the New
York State Pavilion. They will be
directed by Karl Peterson of the
Music Department.

Open With Theme

The group will open their per-
formance with their theme song,
“Brothers Sing On” by Edvard
Grieg. They will then launch into a
varied program, including groups of
European folk songs, sea chantles,
American folk songs, and selections
from musical comedies.

According to one member of the

C .group, “This is the biggest thing

we’ve done all year. But we’ll be
singing outside, and depending on
the weather, it can go great or be
a complete bust.”

Random Program
Peterson plans to pick much of
the program out at random. He

said that he would like to feel the
audience out, and select songs in
accordance with the mood and tem-
per of the crowd.

Tomorrow has been designated
University Day at the Fair. Many
other university singing groups, in-
cluding the Columbia University

Kingsmen and the Sarah Lawrence
Traveling European Chorus, will
participate in the program with
State.

Senate appropriated $200 for the
group to travel to the Fair. The
members will have to pay for their
own meals.

1 Senate Budget Commit-
tee continued its open hear-
ings Tuesday night with the
passage, of the budgets of
MYSKANIA, University
Commuters Association,
S. U. A. Fencing Society,
Campus Commission, Cab-

.. inet, and Senate.

The MYSKANIA budget of $160
was quickly approved. A State Fair
appropriation of $25 was deleted
from the University Commuters Or-
ganization request, making that bud-
get $117. The S.U.A. Fencing So-
ciety budget of $369 was passed
after a brief dlscussldnofthe possi-
bility of Varsity fencing here.

The club’s representative said
.that the club likes its independence
and varsity fencing would eliminate
girls from participation.

Campus Commission, repre-
sented by Wayne Arthurlon ’64, had
its budget out $150, to $250 after
it was pointed out that next year is
the last year the Commons would
be maintained, so new chairs would
not have to be purchased.

Cabinet, the next budget under
scrutiny, was raised $25, to $275
after Kathy Brown '6'? moved to
add that amount for Inauguration
Day. It was pointed out that some

of the money in the transportation ‘

rural events. ,

Before the Senate budget of$5,560
was passed, four in the afflrmatlvq
and one abstention, a lengthy debate
ensued over the salary issue. The
submitted budget has a salary llne
for the S. A. president of $400.

The familiar question, “Is ltnec-
essary” was raised by Harry Gar-
dener ’65. Chairman Udo Guddat
’66 said that he agreed that the
S. A. president has more responsi-
bility than the editors of the news-
paper and should be more outstand-
ing with a salary differential.

He then moved to raise the sal-
ary of the S. A. president to $500.
Guddat felt that the president,
through his salary, should be dis-
tinguished from other people who
have received salaries.

President Johnston '65 said, “If
my salary has been the first one
reviewed, I would have asked for
it to be removed." A possible
criteria for salaries was suggested.

The amendment was passed un-
anlmously.

The possibility of a salary for
the S. A. vice president was raised
and Brown moved that a new line
of $200, salary for S. A. vice presi-
dent, be added. It was pointed out
that as the school grows, this per-
son's duties increase.

This amendment was defeated with
four abstenllons and one affirmative
vote.
