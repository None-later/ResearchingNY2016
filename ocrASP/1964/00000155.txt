A  They Sure Are Stacked at Sayles

 

 

 

 

By ‘Way (9) if the. Wire

 

 

With all the elephant and grape
jokes, snaigs are being ignored,
complains the Edgeclm, Our Lady
of Cincinnati College, Cincinnati,
Ohio.

You know “A snaig in the hand
is worth two in the bush” and “A
stitch in time saves snaigs.” No-
body knows exactly what a snaig
is, but several opinions are gain-
ing popularity: .

l. A snaig is a snom with wire
wheels. 2. A snaig is the father
of shaiglettes. 3. A snaig is what
a young man’s fancy turns to in
spring.

No matter. Just keep in mind
what the famous philosopher said
years ago: “Everything comes to
him who snaigs.”

Shadow Casting

Says the Drury Mirror,
College, Springfield, Mo.:

“Move a little out of my sun,”
we said last week.

“What a stupid thing to say. Who
is in your sun, anyway?” someone
wanted to know.

There is much that is standing
in our sun, and in your sun, too.
It casts a shadow over that which
should be bright.

At any college, the faculty casts
light. Sometimes it casts shadows
as well.

It is hard to generalize about a
faculty, because a faculty is agroup
of individuals. But together they cast
a shadow which is larger and darker
than any of its parts.

The shadows cast by the faculty
are these:

They fall to demand that students
seek out information and understand
current developments in their own
fields.

They fail to exhibit interest in the
world outside. “We're too busy,”
they say. “We have counselees to
counsel and meetings to meet. With
so many students we can't keep
up.” So they don’t keep up with the
world outside and it passes them
by.

Drury

They fall to demand that students
master the tools of understanding
and thinking — of the scientific
method, of skill in written and oral
communication and of development
of a sense of perception.

They fail to permit self-expres-
sion. They discourage controversy.
They avoid the use of dialogue; they
spout facts only to recollect them
later. ,They fail to permit, much
less encourage, curiosity to grow.

The greatest failing is that they
pay lip service to a goal which they
refuse to respect. They have a goal
to create men who know where to.
find information and how to eval-
uate and apply it to circumstances
which cannot be envisioned in this
decade.

They are resolved not merely to
provide a supply of facts by which
a person can perform a specific
task, yet they teach as though their
culture were static rather than dy—
‘namic.

The challenge facing education
is to prepare students for a world
which will be as different from
today as 1915 was from 1964.

What students need, our faculty
has asserted at faculty meetings
and retreats, is to develop a set
of criteria by which they can find
and evaluate new information. This
is difficult to teach in any sur-
roundings and even harder in large
classes.

Task Not Impossible

But it is not impossible. There
are a few teachers in every divi-
sion who succeed splendidly. There
needs to be a more generous ex—
change of thoughts and opinions on
academic matters, and a greater
concern about the quality of the
teaching job and the goals to which
it is directed.

It is easy for a teacher in a
school without research or orienta—
tion to become lazy and afraid of
new theories and new approaches,
as they relate to the subject matter
and to ways of presenting it.

We are simply suggesting that
the university cease its current
practices of minimizing the prob-
lems involved, of misrepresenting
the facts to its students, and of
turning its back on those students
who are going to be faced with a
very real spiritual dilemma: that
of not being able to worship God
in the manner they choose.

But wait. The administration isn‘t

entirely callous. They’re providing
scads and scads of parking places.
All students have to do is provide

Graciela lnes Garcia

give our enthusiastic endorsement
to the recent editorials in the ASP,
particularly insofar as they object
to the production of "non-conven-
tional” plays.

It is perfectly obvious that no
one is really interested in the windy,
avant-garde hysterics of writers
like Brecht, Sartre and Becket.

If anyone doubts this, let him
look around the theater the next
time he goes to one of these plays
and see if he can find any mem-
bers of the faculty and adminis-
tration.

We would therefore like to pro-
pose that for a stimulating season
of drama at this University next
year the D & A Council might con—
sider producing the following sug-
gested program of plays.

The season could be inaugurated
brilliantly, we feel, by a really
handsome mounting of Charley's
Aunt.

This will seem a little daring to
some, no doubt, so that it might be
appropriate to follow with some-
thing light: perhaps Mr. Barrie's
Peter Pan.

In the spring, of course, it is
somewhat difficult to maintain a
very high intellectual tone, so that
.theater lovers could perhaps be
permitted to relax at Show Boat,
and then, to provide an appropriate
climax to the season, why not a
Victor Herbert Festival?

Noted Critic

by Paul M. Jensen

The only films around this past
week that were of any consequence
were Tom Jones, and the I.F.G.’s
sparsely attended revival of A
Night to Remember. But with the
May Day parade as competition,
J. Arthur Rank's well made docu-
ment of the sinking of the Titanic
must have had no chance at all.

This fact provides an opportun-
ity to express some pressing re-
marks and trenchant comments re-
garding the awards, presented a
few weeks back, of the esteemed
Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences, and attempt to dis-
cern some faint logic in the nom-
inations and final choices.

Flick Picks Sick

Of those films chosen as Best
Picture (Cleopatra, How the West
Was Won ,Lilies of the Field, Amer-
ico, America, Tom Jones) only the
last twu had enough quality to even
appear on such a list. much less to
win the award.

Therefore, despite the only slight-
ly better than average overall qual-
ity ofCleo, and the wandering cliches
of that gr nd scale “grade B wes-
tern” (1) How The West Was Won,
these Fox and M-G-M films really
had to be included.

1963 was the year in which the
big studios were beginning to re-
cover from the continual inani-
iies involved in the filming of Cleo-
patra (20th Century Fox) and those
parallel, though perhaps less intri-
cate, problems ofM-G—M’s abortive
Mutiny on the Bounty.

The only reason for the inclusion
of Lilies is that it’s really a kind
of double-header achievement —-
not only was a Negro the main
character. but it a15o had Nuns in
it.

Director Nominations
The fact that only two films of
quality were nominated is admitted
by the category for Best Director.
Of the five “best” films, only the
directors of America, America (Elia
Kazan) and Jones (TonyRichardson)

were moniinated.

replace any of the first three best
pictures, and Ritt deservedthe nom-
ination, Cardinal was apreposter-
ous, ponderous melange of vacuity
that raised many controversial is-
sues, succeeded in endowing them
with the status of true cliches, and
immediately dropped them with a
resounding plosh.

Cardinal Wanders

Preminger’s no-style direction
had no direction, and the acting
was either of Tom Tryon’s rock-
quarry incompetence (he was so
much better in I Married a Mon-
ster from Outer Space), or else
it is wasted on short, less than
interesting, poorly written roles,
as in the cases of Burgess Mere-
dith and John Huston.

The sole glistening light in this
strongly lit and brightly colored
extravagance is a bald—headed Raf
Vallone as what else but aCardinal.

Even the Academy could not see
its way clear to awarding the Gov-
eted statuette to Cleo, despite all
the money it cost.

It did, however, win the award
for best special effects(which should
have been given to its more deserv-
ing sole competitor, The Birds; in
other departments. though, this
Hitchock film was nothing to crow
about), as well as those for cos-
tumes for a color art direction —
which were unarguably deserved.

Jones Deserving

The awards to Jones were def-
initely all deserved, for John Ad-
dison’s score contributed greatly
to the tone of the picture, John
Osborne’s admirably compressed
script achieved a near impossibil-
by of adaptation. Richardson’s di-
rection was bright and original, as
was the resulting film.

Each of the nominees for best
actor had something in his favor -
Finney did a (me Job and besides.
he was in Tom Jones; Richard liar-
ris should have won ii for This
Sporting Lite, a better picture than
any of those nominated; Rex Har-

Picks Sickest flies;

rison made a good Caesar and
gave'CIeopotro its one opportunity
to win a major award — legitimate-
ly; Paul Newman was excellent as
Hud; and Sidney Poitier had just
missed the award .for The Defiant
Ones some years ago.

Dark Horse Candidate

Definitely an outside candidate,
Poitier took the prize for Llllee,
a film that except for the fact that
its main character was a Negro
would have been merely cloying.
it was saved, and became merely
humorous and wholesome, by
Poitier’s personality, charm and
color.

During what was probably adead-
lock among such imposing names
as Caron, MacLaine and Wood, the
equally deserving Patricia Neal
managed to steal off with the statue.
Inevitabiy, a temporary Neal vogue
is currently sweeing the country.

The fact that three talented ia-
dies were nominated for support-
ing actress ill the same filinUones)
probably created another conflict,
during which old Margaret Ruth-
erford pulled her own coup. Lelia
Skala, of Lilies, can be disregarded
altogether.

Melvyn Douglas (Hod) and John
Huston (Cardinal) were sentimental
favorites, and Douglas was a sen-
timental winner. Hugh Griffith
(Jones) was the rightful winner.

West Hardly Best

The greatest phenomenon, how-
ever, of this phenomenal occasion
was the choice of How the West
Was Won for the Best Original
Story and Screenplay. This com-
pendium of cowboy cliches won
over 8 1/2 and America, America,
both superior in originality of ideas
and quality of writing.

While most of the other awards,
mad though they may seem, have
some visible method, this last Lill-
doubtedly is the Academy’s greatest
accomplishment, for it is utterly
lacking in even the slightest amount
of sense or logic.

(1) Quoted from a conversation
with William Colgan, local sage.

on stage

by Pat Fosono

Raft ol the Medusa,

by Georg Kaiser, promises to

be one of the finest productions ever to come from the
Sinic University Theatre, Directed by James Leonard,
the entire play tnch place aboard a raft adrift at sea
and contains thirteen children who escaped from avessel
which had been torpedoes during the War. The story,
which is a rc—cxnminzition of Christian principles, is a
deeply moving one which leaves the viewer with many

self doubts.

From the beginning one is aware of the

haunting; strains of children’s music and is drawn into
the mood of the play by slides portrayingchildrcn caught

up in the horrors of war.

The cast, headed by Mary Temple andJnck ’I‘kntch, is
faced with a great challenge in that they are college stu—'
dents porti'nyingchildi'cn rungingi‘rom ages nine through
twelve. Little Fox, tho smullcstofthe group is played by
Linda Doll's, From boginningioend, the entire cast is on
stage, and there is never a moment when one feels he
is not actually watching children in all their innocence,
in all their cruelty. But it is not only on children that;
the play comments; it is on all of humanity, and the
cast delivers its message well.

Technically, the production as usual, promises to be
superb. The set was designed by Mr. John J. Moore.
it consists of a huge raft which dominates Page stage
and there are times when one almost feels that it were
actually floating. Lighting, usedtastefully and effective-
1y, does a great deal to set the tone and texture of the
entire effort. The delightful sounds of children singing
and a f‘antic drum beat that reaches savage rhythms
create not only a dramatic impact, butatthe same time
point up the irony of the situation.

Raft ol the Medusa,

to be presented Friday and

Saturday nights, is well worth attending. and it prom-
ises to be an experience that will not soon be for~

gotten.
