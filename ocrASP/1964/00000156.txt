Tomorrow afternoon the Peds open a three game ho'mestand as they play host
to, New Paltz. After the three' games at home the Feds take the road for two
games to finish the 1964 season. In Saturday’s game. righthander Ray Weeks will
be on the mound. Ray is still seeking his first win of the season. His record now
 stands at 0-2. with both losses coming at the hands of Siena. In last week’s game.
a, _ Ray allowed only one earned run in the 7-4 loss.

‘ Weak fieldingby the State
nine allowed six unearned
runs to cross the plate
against Siena. Five errors,
four of them in the seventh 7’
inning proved to be the un—
doing of the team. ’ '

Dick Kimball has been the team’s
fireman this season and will be
available if he is needed to come
on in the late innings.

Coach Burlingame has been con—
cerned with the inability of the team
to hit with men on base. Pep
Pizzillo, Gary Smith and Dick Odor—
izzi, the team’s leading hitters,
will be looking for the clutch hits
.with runners on the sacks.

Improved fielding and more timely
hitting will be needed and is hoped
for by Coach Burlingame to give
the home fans a little to cheer
about in the final home stand.

Next Thursday night the Annual Athletics

   

.i.‘ v
Awards

Banquet will recognize the men that have performed
on the athletic field or court this past year. Other than
the shouts of the crowds and personal satisfaction, it
is the only reward these men receive for the hours of

practice each year.

Albany’s athletes do not receive scholarships, special
aid or any other help as do athletes in many other col—
leges. They must carry the same load academically
as the rest of us and they must maintain the same

average to stay in school.

We realize that many other

students participate in some form of activity but they
do not, with a few exceptions. spend twenty hours or
more working until they are about to fall from ex—

haustion.

This year the banquet is free to the athletes as well
it should be. Some of these men will be recognized
for outstanding achievement in their sport and others
will just receive a letter sweater. It is the men that
will not be getting the cheers that we would like to

talk about.

The man on the bench or the ninth man in the batting

order that make the difference between a winning'

season and a losing one. He is the man that the coach
must be able to rely on in the pinch. The superstars
are the point which the team is built around but its
the little guy that makes the whole thing go.

on the stingy side in giving up hits.

The win left the New Haven squad
15-3 on the season. The loss dropped
Albany to an even 4-4.

Williams Exhibltlon

Williams College won an exhibi-
tion game against Albany on Wed-
nesday 8-2.

Dick Odorizzl sustainedayannned
thumb in the game, but is expected
to be able to play tomorrow.

Gary Smith and Pep Pizzillo were
the only bright spots for Albany, as
they each got two hits.

As RPI Ramps to 7-2 Victory

The tennis team suffered their
first defeat of the season as RPI
hustled to a 7-2 romp. The only
victories for Albany were recorded
by John Barthelmes and Bill Enser.
The liPI team proved to be too
powerful in their doubles play and
swept all the doubles matches.

Toni Slocum was defeated for the
first time as a varsity tennis player.
Before the match Coach Hathaway

said that he felt that the Engineers
had a very strong team and would
be very tougii. “They play a tough
schedule,” were the coaches words
as if he almost foresaw the defeat.

The winning streak was ended at
seven, having previously beaten Os-
wego.

The varsity tennis team battled
to their seventh straight victory as
they downed the racqueteers of Os—
wego State, 6-3. The singles play
proved to be the deciding factor as
Albany won all but one of their six
matches.

Tom Slocum and JolmBarthelmes
proved too strong for their opposi-
tion and won their doubles match.
Ed Wolner, John Sturtevant, Keith
Costello and Bill Enser all lost in
the doubles play.

Coach Hathaway said that he was
surprised that the team managed as
well as they did, because the play
was quite ragged.

515, AM Keep Records Perfect

This week’s League Iaction was
very exciting wrth AI’A winning two
games and SLS winning their only
game. Al’A beat Waterbury 11-7
in air offensive game and then came
back to defeat the Sarfs 4—3 in a
defensive, pitching battle. The big
man for AI’A in both games was

Jim Wingate, who had two hits in
each game.
SLS romped over KB 19-0 with
Bot. I'lart throwing a one hitter and
boiling two home runs. Everyone
lll the SL8 line—up got a llll. llart
walked the first man up and then
did not let a hit until the seventh

 

Action a plenty as the hit run is executed in some fast moving

AMlA softball.

In other action the Infinites beat
the llullcheaters 22—3 in a game
which was actually Won in the first
three innings and after that the
game was just a runaway.

League ii
In League 11 action, the Discus—
sei's defeated APA 17-11 as Wel—
come had four hits and Carroll had
three hits to pace their attack.
Waterbury beat Kit 14—10 as Garner
had three hits. Good hitting by Bar-

nard, Willi four hits, and Pierce,
with tWo hits, was wasted in the
loss.

Also, TXO romped over Baggy's
Boys 19-7 in a wild and wooley
game which saw TXO jump into a
commanding lead and then coast
on to victory.

League III

In the only game in League III
saw the One-Eyes defeat KB 7—5
by scoring four runs in the fourth
inning to insure the victory.

Next Tuesday’s game between the
League I leaders APA and SLS will
definitely be a deciding factor in
finding out who will win the First
League Crown. It will probably be
Bob Hart’s pitching against. the fairly
strong hitting of APA.
