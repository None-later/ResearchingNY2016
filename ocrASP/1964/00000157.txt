erect Status Revietreil
For months now the Greek Organi-
zations on this campus have been in
trouble, or put in other words, in jeopardy
of forfeiting their very existence. Var-
‘ious committees have been formed,
boards have met, and new rules and
regulations have been put into effect.

Simultaneously with the manufacture _

of the entire Greek problem came the
era of self-introspection, and much
worse a frenzied attempt to produce
a very real and tangible reason forbeing.

All Hellenic groups became respons-
ible for drawing up new charters, and
re-examining their old constitutions to
unéév'er new scraps of evidence to iden-
tify themselves by.

There can exist some phases of a
social bond between the members of
a group which under ordinary circum-
stances cannot be readily identified.

The administration, however, refused
to leave anything at the door of the
mystical, and required the Greeks to
transcend the abstracts of friendship,
loyalty, and pride for the more con-
crete terms of service and community

aid.

MAY 12, 1964

Why must a group of students ave raging
an age of 20, and who sincerely enjoy
each others company, suddenly find a
“reason” for functioning as a group?

Why all of a sudden must everything
in a social vein be scheduled, or not

scheduled because “What will the Ad-

ministration say” becomes a paramount
objective on the agenda? l
The former question becomes apparent
when one takes into account that re-
cently bandages for the Red Cross are

being rolled, Volunteer work and YMCA

work is being assigned within the in-
dividual groups.

We would merely like to know if any—
one has ever really stopped to think
of the reasons behind a fraternity or
sorority. To the member his affiliation
usually means a great deal, For this
reason he is willing to devote his after—
noons doing hospital work.

But, we want to know, is this record
the only one that will be getting the
Greeks to the new Campus? Isn’t the
idea of these Friday service projects
a bit too absurd?

Faculty, Administration Get Free Ride

For many months now, we have been
wondering why the administration seizes
50 to 100 copies of the ASP, why the
faculty think they should receive every
publication free, why faculty think pub-
lications should be delivered free, why
students feel they should be able to take
as many copies of the paper as they
want, why secretaries and probably char-
women deserve copies of the paper, etc.,
etc., etc.

The publications occupy arather large
section of the Student Associationbudget,
yet there is little if any discussion of
who should be getting the results and
who should bare the burden of cost.

The administration not only seizes
copies in addition to the delivered copies,
but it indulges in a form of legal black—
mail.

Everyone has a folder in some dark
catacomb. The articles a person writes
for the paper and perhaps for the Primer
are clipped and put into the folder which
is supposedly not shown to anyone.

This “not shown to anyone” lie is one
of the most despicable handed to the
student body. One student was asked his
first question by an interviewer for a
job with a reference to an article he had
written two years previously.

It should be a source of immense joy
for the students to know that they are
paying for this blackmail.

If this continues the newspaper may
have to devise ways to make this more
expensive.

and free Primers?
faculty should receive them free just
as much as the students should. If the
students were not paying for them, then
faculty should not either. Since students
are paying for them, the professional
pikers should also.

The administration has received hun-

dreds of copies of this year’s handbook
known as the Campus Viewpoint. These
have been disguised as very few copies
by giving them away to prospective
freshmen and by putting a dozen or so
in many offices and some closets. The
cost is borne by the students.

Should faculty receive free newspapers
We feel that the

Should all members of the “Univer—

sity Community” be considered full and
equal members? This is absurd. The
secretaries, the janitors, the cleaning
women, the food service workers, etc.

are not members of the University Com-
munity to a degree at all like the faculty
and students and non-teaching faculty.

The ASP has reacted to the problem
of the files by havingthe editorialwriters
study each other’s favorite words,
phrases, and techniques. We imitate one
another.

And despite Dean Hartley’s statement
that we are not as anonymous as we
think, the filing has become more diffi-
cult and less accurate since we stopped
putting initials at the bottom of all
editorials.

P.D.Q.

ISC Terms Questioned
Similar Sororities Result

To the Editor:

1 am writing this in protest to
the idea of [SC setting up common
definitions of such terms as “in-
active,” “disassociate,” and"dts-
affiliate" for all the sororities to
accept and follow.

The original causes for starting
this “common” idea were the ap-
parent unfairness of the scliolarslup
cup award, and the problem of sor-
ority housmg on the new campus.

Why can't the administration just
say something to the effect of,
"All inactives will (or will not)
be counted when taking the accumu—
lative averages for the scholarship
cup," and let oath soimity suffer
or gain at cruding to their ‘v’ut j‘ own
definition?

This leave» can b soi'oi it”, With its

individual personality which it has
developed through the years and Is
extremely important to maintain.

Otherwise there will eventually
be no purpose to having separate
sororities. You just might as well
substitute one sorority for the eigtit
now present, and call that one ISC.

To get away from the scholarship
cup, 1 likewise see no reason
for having common definitions of
such terms for any purpose. For
example, as far as living on the
new campus, etc., the administration
just has to say, "All inactives will
(or will not) he allowed to live in
the sorority block.”

if the individual sorority does not
agree, they could just change their
own definition of inactivity to fit
the needs of their own members.

While 18C Is trying to formulate
these “definitions,” they are not
distinguishing betweeeii the causes

 

and effects of the definition and
the definition itself.

If they want to set up a definition
let them do so, btit not set up
rules that could cause a girl to
become inactive or disassoclated,
etc., or what happens to her aftpr
she is called inactive or disasse-
ciated, etc.

These causes are to be left to the
discretion of the sororities them—
selves.

’l‘iien one may ask, “How could
you have a definition without iii-
cludiiig causes and effects." My
solution Is: Don't bother with def—
Initioiis at alli Forget about this
idea of common definitions which
will eventually lead to common sor-
orities as a whole.

This University seems to have
the idea of snubbing out any aspect
of non-conformity and individuality.
Why?

Conservatives Line Up

by Joseph W. Colo

The Conservative Party has more
or less completed its slate of can-
didates for local and l district of-
fices. Its statewide slate will be de-
termined at convention time in Sep-
tembei‘.

The result of this completion
of tickets will not be clear until
election day. but there are many
forecasts involved.

The party has endorsed only 39
Republicans of the incumbent can-
didates for the State Assembly.

The Conservatives have offered
to endorse many of New York’s
17 Republican congressmen who are
seeking re-election. Very few of
these 1'7 have accepted the Con-
servative party nomination.

The. slate of candidates for the
State Senate reveals this same small
correlation between Republican and
Conservative.

In many cases, rather than not
have a candidate at all, the Con-
servatives have named opponents for
people they would liked to have run
as their own.

Counties Reject Third Parties

This hope by the Conservative
Party to nominate all the conser-
vative Republicans has been demol-
ished by the policy of many county
Republican organizations. Nassau
and Rockland, for examples, have
said that no candidate seeking a
Republican endorsement may accept
the endorsement of any other party.

The Conservative party will have
little if any effect in the staunchly
Republican districts. The effectwill
show whe re the Republicans can rely

on less than 60% of the electorate.

This is the case in almost half
of the legislative seats now held
by the GOP. This same problem
of marginal seats is faced by the
Republicans in congressional races.

Primary Involvement

To complicate the picture still
nore the Conservative Party has
taken a hand in disrupting several
primary races within the Republican
party. The Liberal party ordinarily
avoids this practice.

When a candidate is destgnated
by a party, he is successfully noni-
inated unless there is opposition
in the form of a primary. If there
is a primary contest, then there
is no nominee from the party lit-
volved in the primary until after
primary day.

In New York, primary elections
are held only in those cases where
there is an opposition to the or-
ganization choice. This is a method
of strenghtening party organ-
izations.

When the minor party designates
a primary contestant in a major
contest, this leads to charges that
the Liberals are the tail wagging
the Democrat dog or the Conser—
vatives are a tail wagging the Rep-
ublican dog.

This Immediately gives the person
disliked by the minor party a ("dill—
paign issue.

All in all, the small number
of Republicans running on the Con-
servative line has further reduced
the Republican chances of innin—
tainliig their control of the legis—
lature

Group to Aid

‘Freedom Projects’ in Mississippi

“Freedom Summer Project” in
Mississippi are presently being sup—
ported by a group of State students.
The main purpose of these projects
will be the creation of “freedom
schools," community centers, anti
voter registration teams in Misst-
sslppi, long considered the strong-
hold of segregation in the south.

There will be soliciting around
campus in the next few weeks to
raise funds for this project. In ad—
ditioti, a book drive is being organ—
Ized in order to acquire the means
with which to conduct the “freedom
schools."

Students interested in taking part
in the project should obtain appli—
cation blanks from Mrs. Gloria
DeSole of the English Department.

Dorm contacts for the project
are Beverley Callahan ’65, Bru;
Maxine Barman, ’66, Pierce; Char-
lotte Dintenfass ’66, Alden; and
Clotliilde Henry '67, Ontario House.

At the “freedom scliools’ citi-
zens will be instructed in basic
grammar, matheriiatics, and re»
medial reading. Seminars will be
conducted in political science, the
humanities, journalism, and cre—
ative writing.

 

The community centers will also
include remedial instruction, along
with adult Instruction in public
health, family relations, federal
service, and home improvement.

The voter registration teams,
consisting of four people each, will
attempt to secure inaxtiiiinii regis-
tration of Negroes on official county
books.

The Council of Federated Organ-
izations, which includes CORE,
NAACP, SNCC, SCLC, Is sponsor-
ing the project.
