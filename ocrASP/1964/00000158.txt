defeated New Paltz squad
5-4, in a home match last
Saturday, the tennis team
extended its season won-
lost record to eight wins
and one loss.

The key match of the day pitted
State’s Tom Slocum against Jerry
Ziering. This number two singles
contest was in the second set when
all the other singles matches had

been completed. A victory for Slo-
cum was vital because at that point

the match stood 3-2 in New Paltz'
favor.

A loss for Slocum would have put
Albany in a position where it needed
to win every doubles match in order
to win the match. He came through
with the victory; after dropping the
first set 2-6, Slocum fought back
to win the match 10~8, 6-2.

Barthelmes, Enser Win
In the other singles victories,

Varsity Iliamondmen Drop 14-")
Decision to New Peltz State Hawks

by Mike Gilmartin

The varsity nine lost a 14-10
slugfest to New Paltz in a game
played at home last Saturday af-
ternoon. Despite the final score,
the starting pitchers, Tom Clarke
of New Paltz and Ray Weeks of
Albany, were locked in a nifty pit-
chers’ duel for six innings.

The Feds scored in their first
at bat. Mike Putney was safe on an
error and advanced to second on
Don McGurrin’s sharp single to
left. Dick Odorrizzi walked and a
squib hit by Don Mason brought
the run in.

The Hawks of New Paltz tied the
game in the third and went ahead
2-1 in the top of the fifth. A tight
State Defense rescued Weeks from
a serious jam in this frame.

State Rallies
The varsity bounced backed with
two runs in the bottom of the fifth.
Pep Pizzillo lined a ground rule

double over the 340 foot markei
in left. Putney laid down a sacri-
fice bunt and Pizzillo scored when
Putney collided with the first base-
man. Then Gary Smith crashed a
drive along the right field foul
line. Smith made third as the ball
bounded through the right fielder.
Dick Odorrizzi then smashed a400-
foot shot that hit the fence in deep
center field on a fly.

The next batter grounded out to
end the inning.

In the sixth, New Paltz scored
twice to go ahead for good. They
broke the game Wide open in the
seventh. Four walks, two errors,
and three hits. including a home
rtin by Rich Mandia, enabled the
Hawks to plate seven runs. They
added three insurance runs in the
ninth to ice the game.

Albany, rallied to sicore two runs
in the seventh, {our hi the eighth
and one in the ninth, but New Paltz
had an insurmountable lead.

feated Corwin, Ziering 6-2, 2-6, 6-3.

to capture their match with a 6-3
second set conquest. Costello lost
a very close contest 1-6, 6-2, 6-8.

Coach Hathaway Pleased

Coach Hathaway was pleased with
the Win. “I wasn’t very confident
about this match since New Paltz
had been undefeated,” commented
Mr. Hathaway. “However, when we
play at New Paltz, May 23, it will
be even tougher for us since their
home courts are clay courts,” added
Mr. Hathaway.

Sue Hewes makes a smooth hand

all to Karole Neil in WAA track

meet last week. State girls, however, bowed to Oneonta.

The WAA team representing State
last Thursday defeated Oneonta in
softball, 15—8, and tennis, 5-3, but
bowed to Oucontu's girls in truck
last Thursday.

Albany's girls proved very strong
in the tennis match in whichllarriet
Gaillgan, Karen Bock, l’at Sparrow
and Michele Allard beat their op—

ponents in two sets. Donna lteynoids

lost her first set to Aim Kloc but
went on to win the remaining two
sets. The sixth Albany girl lost to
Jean Pierce of Oneoiita in a three
set match.

The girls did not fair as well to
the doubles as they lost both
matches. Karen flock, Angela Mag—
gio, Jane li'arr, Kathy Krautter were
the doubles playing for the WAA
team.

In Softball, Tennis; Loses Track 1..

Uneonta rallied to defeat Albany
in track. Oneonta took first place in
the three events, 50-yard dash,
75—yard dash and relay. State, how—
ever, was iiot completely shut out
since Sue liewes placed avery close
second in the 50-yard dash as Karole
Neil did in the 75-yard dash. The
relay team of Janet Smith, Katie
Lacey, Karole Neil and Sue Hewes
pushed Oneoiita all the way to a
very close finish.

The softball game was called be—
cause of darkness at the top of the
sixth inning with Albany leading 15-
8. State's lineup was pitcher Pat
MacDoweil; catcher. Katie Lacey;

Pat MacDoweil's excellent pitch-
ing proved to be the decisive factor
in the game.

Saratoga Spa’s 7090 yard golf
course was the scene of this three—
team competition. Six men from each
school competed and the four lowest
scores from each learn were totaled
to determine the winner, Albany’s
four-man score was 327 which just
nipped RPI’s 330 total. Hudson Val-
ley finished far behind with 361.

The golf team’s four best scores
were recorded by Fred Maurer.
Stan Rosen, Mike Bayus, and Paul
Bachorz. Maurer shared the day’s
medalist honors with RPl's Bob
Kowaiski as they both shot 79.
ltosen, Bayus, and Bachorz played
the eighteen holes in 80, 82, and 86
respectively.

Wind Hampers Ploy

Doug Morgan and John Vrtiak
were State’s other We representa-
tives in the tourney. All the golfers
were bothered by the strong gusts
of wind prevalent throughout the
afternoon.

Coach Sauers hopes to expand
succeeding tourneys toinclude more
of the local area’s colleges.

Frosh Raoqueteers
Nip Coiilesitill 5-4

State’s i'rosh tennis squad over-
came the elements at Cobleskill
Saturday to pull out a tough 5—4
victory over the two—year college.

itain and high winds, coupled with
the absence of State’s number three
man, made for a close match that
was not decided until the final
doubles contest.

The win upped the frosh rac-
quetecrs to a4-1 record. This week—

    Stateend they hope to continue their win—

ning ways when they face Adiron—

“To say that it was animalistic would be
@an insult to the animal kingdom,” wrote

Mrs. William H. Leue in reference to the

Phi Delta informal party held May 1 at

Fort Orange Club.
Mrs. Leue, wife of Dr. William H. Leue
of the Department of Philosophy, made her
attack on the behavior of the students attend-
ing the sorority’s informal party in a letter-
to-the-editor of the “ASP” ('see page 4).
Dr. and Mrs. Leue had attended the party
as chaperones.

Miss Lucy Parker ’64, president of Phi
Delta, declined an offer by the “ASP” to

:write a rebuttal to Mrs.

 

 

Miss Parker said that by writing such a
rebuttal she would in effect be admitting to
acts which never took place. She said she

In her letter Mrs. Leue alluded to the

Senate passed three of the four
major budget classifications Wed-
nesday night, but their action was
far from the expected rubber stamp
approval.

Vote on the fourth classification,
Culture, was postponed until the
May 20 meeting due to a proposed
change in the guest artist line of
Music Council.

The Council was able to sign only
four of the five artists they had con-
tacted, and aSenator moved to delete
the remaining from the line. Since
this would affect the estimated in-
come llne, the delay was voted to
give the Council time to submit al-
ternate figures for the lines.

Salaries Remain

As in the hearings which pre-
ceded the submission of the budgets,
salaries were again a matter of
much debate. Motions to delete first
the salaries of both the “ASP” and
the “Torch” editors and then to
delete the “Torch” editor’s salary
were defeated, however.

Many of the questions anti argu—
ments which were raised had al—
ready been thoroughly inVestigatcd
in the budget hearings. lint as L‘om—
miss'ioner of l‘inzmcc, Art Ferrari
’lit} pointed out, “ l’t'obuhly no nioi'c
than l'iyc, more likon onc or tWo”
Senators had bothered to attend the
heat mics.

Survey Defeated

Although thc appropriation rc—
unlined tht- same, Senate voted to
remove the stipulation that radio
station WSUA be roqturcd to take a
survey of its listening audience lll
order to continth i'ccoivtng money
for its Ul’l machine.

Senator Debby l“i'letllllllil ’07 who
made the motion, called the stipu—
tattoo “a threat to the very exisn
tence of WSUA.” Arguing lor the
stipulation Senator iiruce Werner
’67, observed that “WSUA is nice
anti all that," but that if it did not
have an adequate audience, it did
not warrant Student Association
funds.

The argument then turned to the
question of who would take the sur-
vey and exactly what it Wouldmcns-
ure. Finally President Art Johnston
'05 argued that “surveys Were not
imposed on any other group," and
the Senate voted 31—13 to remove
the requirement.

Plastic Tux Cords
'l‘Wo bills were passed, one of
which appropriates $1,000 for the

expenses ofproviding laminated stu-
dent identification cards for next
year. The cards will bear a picture
of the student and will be used for
all four years.

A validating card, similar to the
tax card in use this year, will also
be provided each semester for oh-
taining tickets and publications. Both
cards will have to be presented and
the validating card will be punched.

The second bill as an appropria-
tion to the University Center Asso-
ciation for the purpose of contract-
ing entertainment for the Ali—Uni-
versrty Concert to be held next Sep-
tember.

The concert is designed as apro—
gram to bring the entire University
together, as Rivalry, which had

served this function in the past
has been abolished.

Rules Proposed

Senator Anne Uigney ’65, chair-
man of the committee for the re-
vision of Senate rules, moved to
amend the rules for 1963-64 by
substituting the proposed rules for
1964-65. The motion was automat-
ically tabled.

Sue Nichols ’66 was appointed as
University Song Leader. Sopho-
mores Karen Beck and Marium
Tashjian and freshman George Moed
received appointments to Athletic
Advisory Board.

Senate also appointed Mary Mc
Nichols, Tony Riservato, Ellen Ja-
cobs, Juniors, and Diane Patricelli
’66 and Dan Bruce ’67 to Election
Commission.
