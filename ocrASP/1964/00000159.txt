STUDENT UNION

lo lain Support

Members of the “Freedom Sum-
mer" project staged a rally in 
Student Union last Sunday night m
an effort to win the interest and
support of the student body. They
are presently conducting fund and
book drives, and plan to send stu—
dents to Mississippi during the sum-
war.

The Union rally began about 9:00
p.m. with the singing of freedom
songs. Mrs. Gloria DeSole of the
English Department and the student
members of various committees
then spoke to the students about
the project’s goals and the way to
jaw.

The rally closed with the singing
of “We Shall Overcome.” It was
the first time that the Student Union
had been used for such a rally.

Problem Serious

As Miss Clothilde Henry '67 ex-
plained, “The purpose of presenting
it in this way was tojar the mem-
bers of this University into an
awareness of the seriousness of
the Mississippi problem, which is,
in actuality, 'a national problem.”

“Not enough people realize the
extent to which the civil rights
movement in Mississippi has been
limited," she went on, “and still
fewer care.”

Miss Henry was encouraged,how-
ever, by the enthusiasm displayed
by the students in the Union. Many
joined tr. the singing, but she ad-
mitted that she did not know if
they had joined the proyect.

Refuses Service
During the singing of the last
song, Robert Clark ’67, who was
working behind the counter, refused
to serve customers. When this came
to the attention of Frank Vetosky,

As Clark walked away to join the
singers, two other employees, Arno
Leuthardt and Terry Lyon, a1so
freshmen, joined him in sympathy.
They, too, were dismissed.

When asked her reaction to this
incident, Miss Henry replied. “I
think it was very noble of them to
commit themselves." She said that
she believed Clark had joined the
project, but could not say ll the
other two had.

Miss Henry expressed dlsappmm-

According to an article
which appeared in the
“Knickerbocker News” on
May 5, 1964. “Chancellor
Durward B. Varner
charged “irresponsible
journalism,” fired the edi-
tor of “The Oakland Ob-
server," suspended pub-
lication and ordered all
copies of the last issue
destroyed.”

The action, taken at Oakland Unl-

: . verslty in Rochester, Michigan, was

against 20-year old Wolf Metzger.
The issue centered on the results
of a survey on sex which Metzger
had intended to publish.

Mgtzger was following up on a

The Station with {the

project stated by aprovlous "0b-
server" editor. Thln editor had
distributed “a two-page question--
naire about sex to the 288 students
living in the university’s three dor-
mitories because he was alarmed
by rumors that pregnancy was in-
creasing on the campus.”

The quetlonnalre received a re-
sponse of about 80 per cent by the
students. Metzger had tabulated the
results and had them ready for
publication when “Mr. Varner or-
dered him to refrain from pub-
lishing the survey or face suspen-
sion from school.”

Metzger countered with an edi-
torial charging that Varner’s order
showed “embarrassment and hy-
pocricy and the desire to keep
‘0. U. Klds’ better informed about
standards at Harvard and Radcliffe
than at Oakland.

Var 1 th com an which

 

prints the paper and ordered all
copies destroyed. Later Motzger
received a letter stating, “Effec-
tive today, you are relieved of any
association with the “Oakland 0b-
server” and you are not to be a
part of any publication on this cam-
pus while you are a student here."

Metzger was editor of the “Oh-
server” for only one issue - the
one ordered destroyed.

Metzger had taken the position
that, “we are not acting as a pub-
lic relations medium for the uni-
versity and should be free to pub-
lis’h news, even if it is not always
in the university’s interest.”

Varner regarded him as “an ir-
responsible young man ln a re-
sponsible position who is more in-
terested in the sensational story than
in the interest of the university and
the students he is supposed to
