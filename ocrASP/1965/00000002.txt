European Study Pro‘gr'arn is
Veing offered by SUNY at Albany
‘,at the University of Nantes and the

. .Universlty of Wurzburg. The pro-

am is open to qualified graduate
nd undergraduate students and
teachers of French and German.
 In Wurzburg tile session will run

. ' from June 27 to September 4, with
 V acost of $951. This includes round-

trip air transportation, tuition and

tural sites. -

Post-Session Trip
Following the academic session a
two week field trip will be con--

 

A HARBOR Hal .1 ch. Uni-
versity of Nantes, one of the
summer study centers.

 

    

ducted through several parts oi
llaly, France and the Riviera. The
cost of the field trip is an extra
$250, which includes all expenses.

The study- program at the uni-
versity of Wurzburg includes
courses in composition, conyersa-
tion, language, literature and his-
tory.

In 'Nantes' the program will run
from June 24 to August 28, with a
cost of $1110. An additional $340
will be added for the optional post-‘
session tour. The cost for the basic
session includes ‘round-trip air
transportation, with a rate adjust-
ment if an alternate return route
is taken. I

In addition to the academic ses-
sion at Nantes, the participants

will spend a week studying in Paris
and will stay at Cite Universitaire.

Students will be housed in host
French families in Nantes. Several
weekend excursions into the sur-
rounding countryside will be in-
cluded in the cost.

Varied Nantes Program
The study program at the Uni-
versity of Nantes includes courses
in language, civilization and a sem-
inar offering eight hours of grad-
uate or undergraduate credit at
State.

Peace Corps Applicants
To Take Placement Test

The Peace Corps Placement Test
will be given tomorrow at 8:30 p.m.
in Room 334, Main Post Office in
Albany, and in the Main Post Of-
fice in Schenectady.

Peace Corps applicants must be
American citizens at least 18 years
old. Married couples are eligible if
they have no dependents under 18.
Applicants should . bring along a
completed questionnaire which may

be obtained at most post offices.

There are two parts to the Peace
Corps Placement Test, a general
aptitude test and a modern language
aptitude test — for which knowledge
of a foreign language is not neces-
sary.

Applicants should plan on spend-.
ing about one and a half hours at
the testing center, unless they wish
to take the Spanish or French
achievement test. This optional test
will require an additional hour.

No passing or failing marks are
given out, nor will the applicants
ever learn their scores. The re-
sults are used, with the character
references and questionnaires, to
estimate the applicant’s potential
for completing the intensive train-
ing program and their ability to
be effective volunteers.

Over 5,300 Volunteers are now
serving in 46 countries in Africa,
Latin America, and the Near and
Far East. They have a command of
more than 40 languages.

Must Volunteers are now con-
centrated in 17 Latin American
countries. The programs in 15Afri-
can countries also claim a large
share of the American workers.

Four thousand three hundred Vol-
unteers are presently beingtrained.

Club Plans Ski Outings

Fourleen members of the Albany
State Outing Club plan to spend this
weekend at the University’s Camp
Dipplkili. Several will leave early"
today to prepare the camp-site,
while a few others will go up to
camp tomorrow.

As the camp is seldom in use,
it takes some tllne to turn on the
light and water for the farmhouse.

David Valle will chaperono the
group, which plans to spend the
weekend skiing.

The Outing Club will sponsor
skiing trips throughout February,
as long as weather permits. A
special event on February 12-14

will be the annual “Sno-Skl" spoil-
sored by the Yale Oullng Club.
Skiing for the novice, intermediate,

Several faculty members of the
Physics Department at State are
currently undertaking researchpro-
grams in various areas of the Phy-
sics field.

In addition to the faculty projects,
four undergraduates have received
grants from the National Science
Foundation and are now working on
their own research projects.

Professor H. S. Story and his stu-
dents llave been conductingresearch
in nuclear magnetic and quadruple
resonance. Professor Story has re-
ceived grants for equipment and
summer research fellowships from
the Research Foundation of the State
University.

Nuclear quadruple resonance is an
effective tool for the elucidation of
the structure and structural changes
in certain organic crystals.

fects in semiconductors.

General Field Theory

Professor Jack H. Smith has been
working with problems connected
With the development of nuclear re-
actors. At present he is working in
general field theory as a continua-
tion of 1115 neutron studies.

Dr. Henry Chessin, a member of

President Evan R. Collins has
announced that the library at SUNY
at Albany has been designated as a
depository for Federalpublications.

Representing the 29th Congres-
sional district, the Honorable Leo
O'Brien chose State's library astlle
recipient for government publica-
tions covering subject mailer avail-
able fur research by university stu-
dents and area residents.

The plan to use llle library as a
depository was devised as a means
to augment the State Library, nor-
mally the source of all government
information for llle region.

As the graduate enrollments are
scheduled to expand from 1050 in
1964 to 2600 lnl9'10, atoial increase
ill enrollment from 4,700 to 10,000.

tioll invites all interested persons
to “try-out" for the 1965 Revue.
The musical comedy "Fanllyf', a
play in three acts, has been selected
for production.

Paris will be cast for a chorus,
dancers, and approximately fifteen
speaking roles.

Try-outs for the Revue will be
held Thursday and Friday, February
4 and 5 at 7:15 p.m. in Page Hall.
These two days will constitute the
only sessions for casting.

Tile Revue is scheduled for pre-
sentation on March 12 and 13, with
a special preview on Thursday,
March 11 for area high schools and

 colleges.

Another pressing need of the Re-
vue is that of accompanists. Anyone
interested in providing the musical
accompaniment for "Fanny" sllould
be prepared to begin rehearsals at
the beginning of second semester.
Interested persons should contact
Mary Setter at 482-4244.

rule of an adnlinistration so bogged

versity will lose one of its best
