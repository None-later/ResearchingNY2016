has been attempting to institute some

of these necessary changes.

Its most tangible accomplishment so
far has been the granting of upper-
classmen hours to second semester

freshmen.

The AWS can do much more if it can
gain the support of the women on cam-
pus. Every forty women have an elected
representative, and they should make
sure that she knows their requests and

is working for them.

Individual students are also welcome
at the weekly meetings, and may express
their ideas and views. The meetings are

held every Tuesday night.

We believe that Albany women deserve
to have a degree of social freedom and
responsibility equal to the academic
freedom and responsibility they are ex-

pected to accept.

We also believe that when they de-
mand this right, they will receive it.

Albany Session Dec. 14

The 1964 New York State Elec-
toral College held its sessions in
an almost empty Senate Chamber
at the Capitol building in Albany
on December 14.

The procedures of the session
held in Albany are prolably i-epre.
sentatlve of those lnihe other siates.

After a call to order and an lnvo.
cation, the names of the New York
electors were submitted to Governor
Rockefeller by Charles Palmer.

After a rollcallvoie which Silu'. t
that three electors were absent
among the forty-three, the vacancies
were filled.

It was evident that it was known
in advance that the three 'r'iti‘illll'les
would exist because three people
were standing by waning to be
nominated and elected to serve as
members of the Electoral College.

Temporary President Elccicd

The next order of iiUSlllPSS when
the session covened was to ~rjiepl
a temporary president and int-urem—
porary secretaries for file tiviii‘ge.

Mr. William McEweii who was
elected temporary pl'esillciii mode
a few re’marks after he was "es-
corted to the chair." He said ihat
the electoral college is "stooped
in tradition” and "has whim

nation that has long officially ac-
knowledged the equal status of the
sexes? Most psychologists agree
that women are usually more ina-
ture than men of the same age, so
the reason caiuioi be that men can
handle their freedom more respon-
sibly titan women.

There remains only one explana-
tloii for the inequality of the rights
of the sexes here on campus: the
physical manifestations of sexual
promisculty are far more serious
for the "fairer sex.” Thai is, wo-
men get pregnant and men do not.

The University. then, must feel
that separation of the women from
ihc men at one o’clock sharp will
eliminate such a consequence. II
this is a valid assumption, then

In short, I believe that curfew
for college women is an unjust
anachronism which should be quickly

‘John' lamenzo, who-was the Inn-
onoon host, spoke after the college
i nvened. i .
reclibmitnzo said of the forty-three
electoral votes being cast by New
York that the "people at the polls
spoke their chpice, but not until
you (the electors) have cast your
votes will New York’s votes be
official."

“Proceedings such as these are
taking place all over the country

first time.“

Falls at Electoral System

" menzo continued, “A major
hn‘nal poll showed that a sub-
stantial number of people favored
change. However, a New York Bar
Association poll shows a favoring
of keeping the present electoral
college system."
The college is often criticized
because there is the chance that
someone can be elected president
and not have a majority of the
popular vote. Lomenzo spoke in
favor of the college.
“Being man-made, the system is
not perfect, but it is one that works
effectively even in the space age,
reflecting the will of most of the
people.
“It is a culmination of the process
where Americans exercise their
free will to say who among them
shall be their leaders, though your
(ti. electors) roles are largely
ceremonial.”

Farley Permanent President

Next, a permanent president and
two permanent secretaries for the
college were elected. James Farley
was selected as president. He is
a former postmaster general of
the U. S. and served as a member
of the electoral college in 1932 and
1930 and In the New York Assembly
in 1922.
Farley briefly i-einlnisced of his
past experiences in office. Bill Dap-
pling of Albany, the oldest member
of the college, was called art to
speak. He has served as an elector
sash times since 1932.

"Green Ink”

He looked back on a “green ink”
episode where some ballots were
signed in green ink and faded. Far-
ley added that he had slgnei a large
