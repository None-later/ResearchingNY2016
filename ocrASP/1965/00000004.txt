Two students from Forum of Pol-

on Latin American Affairs, which
was held at the Inter-American

, University in San German, Puerto

Rico, December 18-23.
The theme of the seminar was
“The Political Ideology of the Dem-

, ocratic Left in Latin America."

It was sponsored by the Associa-
tion of International Relations Clubs.

Harold Lynne and Ed Silver were
among 180 students, representing
universities from all sections of the
United States, who attended the sem-
inar. The six-day conference was
built around a series of lectures
by experts in the field of Latin
American affairs.

Sevequ Notable Speakers

Notable speakers included Dr.
Ronald C. Bauer, President of In-
ter-American University, W. W.
Rostow, Chairman of the State De-
partment Policy Planning Commit-
tee, Luis Alberto Sanchez, Senator
of Peru, and Richard Schroeder,
Acting Coordinator of the Pan Amer-
ican Union Information Team on the
Alliance for Progress. _

Dr. Bauer, who delivered the key-
note speech of the seminar, dis-
cussed the importance of education
in the development of Latin America.
He stated that full—scale educational

place after a motion was made and
passed to proceed with the voting.

Farley as president of the col—
lege was given the honor of casting
the first of New York's electoral
Votes for President. James Henley
of Albany cast the first vote for
Vice President.

The ballots were pushed into a
pile and apparently without looking
at the ballots or counting them,
the tellers announced that forty-
three votes had been cast for Lyn—
don Johnson and Hubert Humphrey.

Among the electors were many
important Democratic leaders, as
William Luddy of westchester,
Peter Crotty ofErie County, Farley,
and Edwin Weisl, Sr., who is the
new national committeeman. David
Dubinsky, prominent in labor, was
also an elector. A few brief re-

marks on the "honor" involved in
serving as a member of the electoral
college ended the session.

On January 6, 1965,Congress met
in Washington, D. C. and coupled the
votes cast in the electoral college
sessions of December 14.

Educational Reforms Vital

Dr. Bauer said, “The profes-
sions - law, medicine, the church—
have been the only predominant
fields of education in Latin Amer-
ica, while the pure sciences and
the more practical fields of knowl-
edge for a technological age are
not being provided."

He also stressed that North Amer-
icans should become better educated
about Latin America. Without this,
he stated, “it is impossible for
North Americans to understand
Latin American problems withinthe
context of Latin America."

1965; Crucial Year
Rostow’s speech was entitled
"Latin America and the Alliance
for Progress."

'Rostow termed 1964 a relatively
successful year for the Alliance
for Progress as far as laying the
groundwork for “proper channeling
of economic aid in Latin America."
He expressed the opinion that 1965
will he the crucial year for Alliance
for Progress.

Senator Sanchez, who has just re-
cently returned to Peru after twenty-
two years of political exile,outlined
Latin American plans for improving
infra-hemispheric unity. Towards
this aim several South American

From this meetingemerged aplan
which Senator Sanchez feels could
be a major step in improving rela~
tions between Latin American coun:
tries. Under this plan a citizen of
any Latin American nation would
be regarded as a citizen of any other
Latin American nation that he
visited.

Economic Program Proposed

Schroeder lectured on the “Latin‘
American Heritage in a Changing
World." .In order to speed up the
economic development of Latin
America, Schroeder believes that
a two-fold program must be adopted.
“We must look inward and outward
simultaneously,” Schroeder said.
He explained, “the internal coun-
tryside must be modernized and ex-
ports must be diversified.”

Following each lecture, small dis-
cussion groups were formed; these
groups summarized and evaluated
what the speaker had said. The offi~
cars of the A.I.R.C. served as dis-
cussion leaders.

When asked to evaluate the sem
inar, Ed Silver said, "avast amount
of information about Latin American
affairs was gained from this confer-
ence. My one criticism is that it(
was this-titled -— there was not

even one discussion of the political
ideology of the democratic left in
Latin America.’!

\Fans were set up to create cur—

would delicately move; circus
clowns and acrobats fashioned in
twisted wire; and a gigantic stable
on the main floor. This was Alex-
ander Calder’s work, and it was
seen gloriously in wild profusion
at the Solomon R. Guggenheim mu-
seum.

The show will end shortly, butI
had an opportunity to see this event-

dents also saw Calder’s work in
New York.

The show proved the fantastic

one walks down, he more or less
comes upon newer and newer works.

Wide Variety

Most of us, I am sure, think of
Calder primarily as a sculptor,
and particularly, as the creator of
the mobile. Yet the Guggenheim
devoted its showing to the wide
variety of Calder creations.

Delightful pen and ink drawings
1 animals and men, similar to those
sed for that marvelous book of
Richard Wilbur’s “Bestiary"were
generously displayed.

Tapestries and a booked rug ex-
ecuted by others after Calder's de—

Itlons.

In addition, lithographs lnthe pri-

and designs vibrant in their gaiety.

(drier Show at Guggenheim Reveals
lusting Patterns, Vibrant Design

by Jim Schreler

Eurodisc, an important German
label now available in the United
States, offers a catalog that will
interest both musician and collec-
tor. ‘

A case in point: Weber’s neg-
lected “Oberon” (presented here
in two orchestral and light Vocal
selections — Eurodisc 70 828 KR)
demands a cast of virtuosi.

A live performance can be ham-
pered by staging, the drama by an
uneven mixture of music and dia-
logue. But Weber’s music is the
key to this midsummer night dream
adventure.

In a cast headed by the brilliant
Jess Thomas, lunch of the music
takes shape. While Erika Koth is
an amateurish “.\Ieerma(lchen,”In-
grid Bjonei"s liezla (-mnbines flexi-
bility with character solidification.

Montoux and Debussy
Piers Monteux, the beloved mous-
tache of music, died at all lastyenr.
This legendary conductor has given
us a warm album of Debussy that
combines the three “Images: and
Symphonir'

Fragments from the
"Martyrdom of Si. Sebastian.”
Monteux contrasts Debussy's

moods to studies in the sensuous
and the mystical (Philips PfiS 900-
058). Tile exotlr “Perfume de la
Nuite” and the crisp "Le Maiin
tl’uh Jour dc Fete” of “Ibera,”
are played against the warmth of
“Rondes do Printemps.”

Here lilcnteux smooths and
shapes with ease. And, at last, the
neglected “Le Martyrs de Saint Se-
bastian” stands in the awe and at-
mosphere wherein it properly be-
longs.

Better Stereo

llerhert von Karajen leads the
Berlin Philharmonic in a new Stra-

Eight," its massive black legs con-

about it, under it, staring at it,
wonder-struck.

Calder’s bent-wire creations

to the show suggested) drawings

"The Circus"

In everything I found galety, joy,
a glimpse of life or exploding pat-
tern. Calder’s large series ofsmall
figures called “The Clrcus”donein
the days of the depression, seemed
to characterize the entire Guggen-
heim display of Calder.

I have never gone to an exhibition
of any artist’s work which was as

casional lags, and it is not forevery
taste, but it is lively and original
and predominantly successful.

“That Man from Rio,” another
French film with Belmondo, is a
fast and furious spoof of adventure
films, which still provides — as
does the Bond film — a good deal
of its own excitement.

The characters, Belmondolnpar—
ticular, always seem to be running
somewhere, an effect which is in-
creased by having the camera close-
ly follow them. The acting and stunts
are very fine.

Fun Flicks Predominotc

Fun seems to be emphasized lhls
year, with "Rio," "Russia," and
“Woman,” but "Easy Life" reveals
the fulseness of such “fun” when
transferred to real life. “Seduced”
uses humor to comment on mores
which, while specifically Sicilian,
are more universal, and "Strange—
love" combines comedy withterror,
not alternately, as is rather com-
mon, but at the same time.

Other worthwhile films of the
year, which just barely missed the
list, are "A Hard Day’s Night,”
"The Organizer," “'l‘opkapl,"
“Becket,” “Nothing but the Best,"
and “The Luck of Ginger Coffee."

Overblown Reputation

The most overblown reputations
of the year are those of Blake Ed-
wards and “one Potato, Two Po-
tato." The latter, while doubtless
with the best of intentions, is an
artless film about intermarriage.
The cards have been so stacked for
the judge to make the "wrong" de-
cision that it makes no point, and
the film is, on top of this, a real
bore.

Edwards, touted as the new Mack
Sennatt. really seems completely
ignorant of how to time and prepare
for a joke. The humor of his two
big comedies of the yc-nz',“'l‘;u.- Pink
Panther" and "A Shot in the Dark,"

Excellent microphone placement
gains access to all the multi-voiced,
polytonal complexities of this fa-
miliar score. All around, this is a
good "Rite of Spring."

From “West Side Story” to his
third "Kaddish" Symphony, Leonard
Bernstein remains at the peak of

musical creation. The criticism to.

“West Side Story” has been posi-
tive, to the “Kaddlsh” negative.

“If man has faith in God, should not'

God have faith in man,” asks the
composer. To some, this isaheret-
lcal statement.

Literary Idea

Bernstein, like Mahler before
him, composes from a literary idea.
The “Kaddish” follows the com-
posel"s text, here read by Felicia
Montealegrc.

The music only supports and am-
plifies the text. Since Bernstein is
able to search out "an answer“
(unlike Mahler), religious leaders
have damned the work.

[is full potentialities are realized
in the Inst lines: “We are one,
after all, you (l.e., God) and I: To-
gether we suffer. together exist,
and forever will createeachother.“

Sellers.

The bigge‘st bomb of the year was
“The Visit.” Duerrenmai’splay was
miscast, and directed in a realistic
manner entirely opposed to the styl-
izaifon the story demands.

"Flight from Ashyia" was not
quite as had (only) because it didn’t
even have the potential of quality.
"Marnie" was an utter loss as
well, save for its opening.

Fine Acting Highlights Year

Some of the best acting came
from Gunnel Lindblom and Ingrid
Thulin (“Silence”), Paula Prentls
(“Henry Orient"), Deborah Kerr
("Iguana"), and Stefina Sandrelli
("Seduced").

On the male side,
Peter Sellers
