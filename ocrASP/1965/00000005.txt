A RayView of Sports

by Roy McCloat

 

As previously stated in this column, it is our inten-
tion to provide accurate and adequate sports coverage
of State athletic events. We are not, however, the only
source of sports information for interested, avid fans.

Besides ASP descriptions and write-ups, there is
the local city newspaper coverage, spearheaded by
the “Times Union’s” popular Mike Dyer, and Albany
State’s own radio broadcast over WSUA.

Now in its second year of broadcasting State basket-
ball games, WSUA has made such great strides that we
feel that it won’t be too long before the station carries
other Albany sports events as well.

The sports department is a new and welcome addition
to \VSUA this year. The department is comprised of
director Andy Mathias, who has a weekly sports show
on Sunday nights at 7:15 p.m., John Haluska, Pop
Pczzillo, and Ron Hamilton.

Although this hard—working crew has had no previous
experience at sports broadcasting, the job they do is
professional-like in every phase of the word. They
have broadcast every Fed home basketball game and
also the away contest with the University of Buffalo.

Hardest part of the job? identifying opposing p1ay~
ct's, naturally. “Also,” udn'iits broadcaster tialuslca,
“being impartial in our play—by—play descriptions.”

\VSUA will be broadcasting tonight’s game with
Cortland, tomorrow night’s game with Potsdam, and
Wednesday's meeting with Oneonta. So if you can’t
come out to see the games for yourself, tune in to
WSUA, 640 on the dial.

Congratulations to Ray Weeks and Danny Zeh for
making the first squad on tho All-Capital District
Tournament team. Zeh also was co~wimior with Siena’s
Jack Mulvcy as the tournament’s MostVaiuable Player.

How do you feel about the new rule not allowing the
coach to leave the bench during the course of the
game? The concensus here is that it deprives the fans
of one of the oldest, spectator thrills in the game. You
know. seeing how much abuse the referee would take
before slapping a technical foul on the team.

‘Tiger,’ 'Typists’ Run

Continues in Richardson

The current presentations of the Department of Speech
and Dramatic Art — “The Tiger” and“The Typists” —~
will continue tonight through Saturday evening. The two
plays by Murray Sohisgal are being produced in the
Richardson Hall Studio Theatre (Richardson 291). All
performances begin at 8:30 p.m., and all seats are re—

served.

Tickets for the remain-
ing performances can be
obtained at the box office
in Richardson 279. The box‘
office is open from 10:30
a.m. to 3:30 p.m. daily.

Admission is by Student Tax or
$1.50.

The two plays are under the di-
rection of Professor James Lecit-
ard. Both coiiiedtes were produced
successfully off-Broadway several
years ago. They are cotiiic, btit also
serious examinations of the hopes
and desires of man, and are said to
have “the! beat of the generation.”

'I‘im Atwell and Christine Smith
play the two roles in the "The T1-
ger." The play was first seen in
London in 1960.

it is a humorous-portrayal of
the male-female relationshipwlth
a reversal of the dominating per-
sonalitles.

"The Typists” is also a two role
play. It is an intensive study of
the cotnic cliches of a patterned
way of life. Jon Barden and Diane
Sonierville are cast in this pro-
duction.

Play Review l

by Bruce Daniel 5

Murray Schisgai's set of one-
act plays, "The Tiger” and “The
’I‘yplsts" (now appearing at 8:30
p.m. iii the Richardson Studio The-
atre through Saturday), is an amus-
ing exercise in Pop Drama.

The pinys’ connection with that
current rage in artistic fashion,
Pop Art, is telegraphed in the Jas-
per Johns-style program and pub-
licity (the insipldly attractive com-
ic-strip characters) and the mind-
less "incidental" inuslc.

Pop Art assumes that life, in our
crass over-organized culture, has
outLdlstanced art — that imitation
of vulgar artifacts (like giant plas-
ter-of-paris hot dogs) is a more
profoundly penetrating comment on
American culture than any artistic
moralizlng. ~

But Popplsm, ln obliterating dis-
tinctions between artandlife, moves
beyond satire, and wallows with
nostalgic delight in the banality it
aims to reflect.

New Campus Architect Views Work,
Stone Reacts F avorably to Buildings

by Harold Lynne

In interview with the ASP
Sunday afternoon, world-
renowned architectEdward
Durrell Stone expressed
great pride in the univer-
sity’s New Campus build-
ings, which he designed.

Stone and several associates made
an itttpubllcized inspection toiir ofthe
New Campus Sunday morning. Since
his tight schedule limitedthe amount
of time he had to spend in Albany,
Stone requested that no notice of
his visit be given to the local press.

Grants ASP Intorvlow

However, when approached by the
ASP, Stone graciously consented to
answer a few questions.

When asked about lllh reaction to
the structures that have beeuerected
thus far, Stone stint, “l cutne up
with my colleagues today to look
over the cttnipits and we're very
proud of the place."

Stone bod rot-unintended that each
suite be carpeted as an acoustical
iiieusuro, since t'urpoting absorbs
noise. "However, the State felt that
the cost Would be too great," he
said. ‘

Unique Opportunity
Stone poiitted out the uniqueness
of his architectural project. "i was

presented with the opportunity to

design one great forinul architec-
tural cotiipositlcn; it is unique when
it campus for 7500-pius students is
all built at one tithe," Stone said.

He added, “Harvard, which is
about the same size. took since

 

1030 to build; thus you have build-
ings of varied sizes and architec-
tural styles."

At this point, reference was made
to the symmetrical patterns of the
New Campus. Stone, who apparently
prides himself on the symmetry of
his architecture, smiled and said,
“this was otir aim — the fact that
the campus is very symmetrical
makes it a formal composition."

Compared with Versailles
lie commented that when all the
formal landsoaptng is completed,
be ex Meets the New Campus to be

cite of the showcases of the state.
Stone said, "When all of the won-
derful landscaping plans are ful-
filled, l think this campus willcom—
pare to Versailles where there is
also great formal architectural
composition.”

Edward Durroll Stone has earned
international fame for his architec-
tural endeavors. Sotne of his works
are the United States Mission to
the United Nations, United States
Embassy in lndlu, and, presently
under construction, the John F.
Kennedy Memorial Center in Wash-
ington, D. C.
