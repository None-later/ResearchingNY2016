.little to the total effect (difficult though it ‘may be to

greatly increases the printing costs. The poor taste
of this color is incongruous in a University Theatre
which prides itself on quality productions of superior

material.

Throwing money away on such trash does little to
improve the image of University Theatre or the Uni-

versity itself. Rumors are always rife concerning pro-
posed tours for various productions. and it seems that
money saved from such needless expense could easily
be applied to taking productions throughout the state.

and with the indications excellent
that this long delayed programvwill

to see increased activity by .those

A Fishy Tail

 

 

Once upon an ounce oi rye in an
errban clangdoom there leered
through a mist oi eighty-one ig-
nighted cigarettes twelve monkeyed
cads. Wowing and slurping, the jest
ters oi juice lestured to one another
as the made oi their noctural dream
wishes trapsed into their oval poor-
spectives. Drinking in the exotic feet
and flat back of dishy dame, each
swain consulted his neighing bore if
he might be the won oi Sinderella,
who, making the magic eighto'clock
curiae on this Freeday at her fever-
ite dunce hole. swiitly locomoted to
the soot table with her quart oithree
:‘heiles.

Sinderelia had turned down dates
with jabs from her pin, the one
Prince Charmable had secured her
with, but had released this statement
to the prosaid:

“Like doll, languish at yon ball
this eve.”

"What, tootsy, ou baby, ou?"
Quested the iouts.

She inoscentiy lafted, “Ya seez."

'1’, baby. Y." cried they.

So it was that Sindy tudiously tud-
died her text through a filth of tea
because she feared maiden iorm
would not squeeze into her box and
lables. Finished with her music
paper en Beethoven from a copy of
Prince Charmable's Syracuse As-
say, she deshyeded to roll over to
believe with the mops and Schiller-
vlced Zaqueries, hours oi horrors.
Dusting off her Lord dz Taylor logs
with their marks oi her lackademic
sluiiery, Sindy fished down to the
bottom of her laundry bag and
grabbed the must sweator shirtplus
a pair of yakee Leailys. Releasing
her mane over her shoulders and
blistering her mug ‘with powtar and

glibstick, Sindy shouted to her dame
mates.

Prancing and primmlng, the trox-
icoy repaired wit their leadore
whose beauty they alladmared. With
Sin, these prinsisses ielt seacurein
cacheing some onion or ripi mi-
grunt or justaplain oiled irusternity
mine with a fat hauot. lt wasn’tthat
they looked dun at their college but
they heard distant dreams. As they
exited rosey den hole, an old magic
halted their proyezeeon.

"0h hully st to furry cod mutt,"
said Sindy whose distaste was op-
tvious. I

"Again, slur Sindy, ye look like
a wench. But mother 1 am not to
thee, yet whorken - i will turn you
into a campus if you be late.”

"If i beladded, i marry my pin
mate. There so. i do what I know
and it likes me. Pox upon thee. Give
me libeerty or give me durth." The
four left in uproarious rancor and
slopped and walked to the cotillion.

Thus"we again are back at the
point oi debouchure. Noise peei-
sating primed the native tendencies
oi the, jivey beds. In a metamor-
iorces similar to Kaika’s horror
tail, edukated skolars twisted into
flying birds with no knowledge of
their transformation. Everyone was
doing it.

“What?”

“Why, the Jerk. Come on Sindy,”
encur, raged a hindsome load.

“I’ve never done it."

“You chicken." Shouted the dis-
mayed bull and charged off to his
pen.

v A.M.A. and Kerr-Mills

The "Detroit News” summed up
the Association’s position quite well
when it said: “As every faithful
follower oi the A.M.A. line knows,
any governmental move to aid the
plight oi the aged ill is socialism
and anybody who advocates it is an
enemy oi the Republic. Nor does
the A.M.A. come forth with any
'positive program of its own. it is
content to stick to its sterile line
oi being anti-everything."

The A.M.A. has reluctantly ia-
vored the Kerr-Mills program which

is presently on the .books and in_
limited operation. The difficulty with '

this weliare approach to the press-
ing problem oi the aged til is that it
requests state initiative in setting
up the program and also state iunds
to cover half the program's cost.

Kerr-Mills Inadequate

Lack oi state monies, however,
has limited the Kerr plan’s cov-
erage to only hali oi our fifty
states and has forced those that
are able to support the program to
establish rigid means test require-
ments.

In our own New York State for
example there is a means test limit
oi $500 on life insurance, a stipula-
tion that relatives oi the aged ill
must pay the cost oi their medical
care, and provides that the state
may seize the estate oi anyone re-
ceivin assistance u on their death.

To top this off, Kerr-Mills is
essentially a welfare program and
there is something inconsistentwith
the basic American character when
,a man who has worked hard during
his productive years must throw
himself on'the indignities of public
charity because what we lacked in
courage we made up for in ex.
pediency.

Contary to what may be thought,
the Medicare plan does not provide
for the payment oi doctor’s fees,but
only for hospital and nursing home
care. Although much has been made
of the “outlandish” cost oithispro-
gram, current estimates are that it
will involve only a 1/4 of 1% in.
crease- in the present Social Se-
curity tax rate.

Threat of Socialism Scored

Twenty years ago it was argued
that the Social Security Act would
be the iirst step to the complete
socialization oi the American way
oi life; yet our capitalistic system
is ﬂourishing more prosperousthan
ever. ii, indeed, that was the first
step, it has taken us twenty-eight
years before We have even con-
templated taking the second step.

Now, we may wait another thirty
years longer before taking the third
step toward this "complete sociali-
zation" of American society — and
maybe by'that time it will beneﬁcia—
sary, just as this step is necessary
if we are to ,make a smooth tran-
sition into the dynamic era we are
entering.

“Much too are you,” said she.

‘Graduate Student Protests,
Changing of School Colors

To the Editors:
1 read with dismay an article in
a recent issue oi the ASP.

The article was about a com-
mittee being formed to “initiate
the changing oi colors..."

Several years ago when the issue
of changing colors was discussed
openly and without instant com-
mittees, Senate voted the idea down
with nearly unanimous opinion being
expressed.

It became known from rumors
that the colors were going to be
changed. Senator William Leo ac-
cepted the idea oi the rumor as
did almost everyone.

Leo made a motion to change the
colors. This motion was carried
with no enthusiasm.

After extensive criticism, Sen-
ate’s chairman, the Sttident Asso-
ciation President, announced that
no move was planned by the admin-

istration and that no move would be
taken unless at the.exprcss wish
of the students. The expression of
student views was to he the vote of
the Senate.

With this acourate llliol'llllilloil
Senate reversed itself and voted to
retain the present colors of the
University.

The members of Senate and the
News Board oi the then State Col-
lege Newa were assured by a mem-
ber of the administration that no
action was to be taken with regard
to the colors oi the school.

Perhaps this assurance is just
one oi the many lies that lune Icon
handed to the students of this lilll-
versity. Perhaps it is not.

(pour les estudiantes (i’anglais)

i feel that this poetical endeavor is obviously typical of Mlllbrook.
i believe this because he has high emotion appeal and that he shows
a concern for colors and colored things. (See Monarch Review Notes
on this point.) Mr. Stalcy also told us that Wallace Stevens writes in
this style - lel‘Zfi rima with much emphasis on the terza. 0n the other
hand, when you consider his imagery, you are stunned. See Dunihleton

on this point.

The structure shows much art, but is highly arbitrary. Thesame
could be said for the rhyme and meter. Many poetical allusions are
made, and i do not feel that the poem is realistic, because it has no
reference to a deus est machina (the way this gender of poem usunlly

ends). See Mcllwuine on this point.

The philosophy of the poet is that many times things are seldom what

is but a dream. Many modern poets have this

problem. See Campbell on this point. Moreover, when you think that
this was “often thought but ne’er so well stated" (see Knotts on this
point), i am resplendent. Yet, “this.is the way the poem ends, etc."

Furthermore, I like this poem because it is not only, stimulating,
but also, exciting. it is arousing to the intelleci,howover.[learned
from this poem and also from How 'Does a Poem Mean? that often a
poet uses symbols which often symbolize colors and colored things but

which really aren't colors and colored thin s at all but reall danotate
