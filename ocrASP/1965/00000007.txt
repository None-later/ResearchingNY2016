This is a dorm closet. Color it full —
and messy - like the room. Color your
self late for class because you can't
find your brown shoes. Color the shoes
green.

Epitome of Excellence

in the cold, dark corners oiAibany’s
hallowed halls they sit with a
bottle in one hand and a pen and
paper in the other.

With only one thought in mind they
work: to try and stumptheirpoor,
lowly students!

They compete with each other to
see who can find the most pica-
yune questions that areirreveiant
to the course, ones for whichstu-
dents would never study. With
blood, sweat and tears theylabor,
so as to make it impossible for
their students to pass.

Those who succeed are held with
high esteem by their compatriots.

Not many reach this epitome, but
those who do are assured by the
administration oi a pay increase.

Some do not succeed in reachingthe
quota lrul the administration takes
care of them. They are never seen
again.

Oh! what cold creatures they are,
making three hour tests [or stu-
dents to do in two hours.

Tears will not sway them. for they
are heartless.

One poor student tried to tight thelr
tyranny alone, but he is now work-
ing as a ditch digger.

The only hope, fellow students, ls
to revolt, all you have to lose is
your E’s!

Color the scholarships “not in yet."
Color the student broke.

 

This is a final exam. Profs, color the
students unprepared and stupid. Students
color the prof stone hearted and narrow
minded. In either case, color the test
paper empty.

Got a second? Lend an ear. Dodge's all
lltl'W. hot new Coronet 500 has got an
awful lot gorng tor ll (hesrdes; your girl).
For instance: buckets and backup lights.
lull carpeting and a console. spinners
and a padded dash~all standard equip-
ment. More? Much! Like an engine
lineup that would make any car squeal
tor joy: 273, 318, 36l. 38.3 or 426 cubic

  

 

inches. Like a lean and hungry look. And
like a low, low price tag—Coronet costs
less than any fullsrze Dodge in years.
We can't hope to make you a believer
with an ad. so we‘d like to extend an in-
vitation—come and see the 1965 Coronet
500 at your nearest Dodge dealer's.
Bring your girl along . . . it makes for
a cheap date.
