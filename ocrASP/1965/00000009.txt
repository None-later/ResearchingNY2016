Peckham Leads Scoring Attack

Laurie Peckllam led a field of
six in double figures with 10 points.
He was followed by Larry Mar-
cus (17), Tom Doody (17), Tim
Jursak (15), Tom Carey (11), and
Gordie Sutherland (10).

Gary Nizik led the ACC scorers
with 24 markers and Tim Burns
canned 17. The ,Peds held the much-
haralded Damien Fantauzzi to eight
points.

As far as the Feds were con-
cerned, the smashing victory was
a top team achievement, with every
man hitting for at least one field
goal.

The team’s powerful scoring was
justly complemented by the squad’s
fine rebounding, especially from
Marcus, Peckham, and Denny Elkin.

Crowd Aware

As the second half wore on into
the later stages, the fans became
aware that the Feds were nearing
the century mark. Dave Roberts

free throws to break the Page flail

.' Combining an impene-

, trable defense and excel-

lent bali control. Albany

v State’s Peds scored their
' fifth and sixth victories of

the season. over Cortland
and Potsdam, on January
8 and 9.

Highly touted Potsdam entered
the game with an impressive 6-1
record_and a well-drilled ball club.
The team's great strength is in its
tight defense and bail-hawking, full-
court press.

Jim O'Donovan accounted for the
first two points in the contest with
a short jump shot and was immed-
iately matched by Potsdam’s Roland
Yarbourgh. Such was the story for
the first half, as botll teams con-
tinued to trade baskets.

With 10 minutes gone by in the
game, the score stood at lO-li in
favor of Albany, with O'Donovan
contributing five of State's points.

Crossett Foils Press

Potsdam resorted to its usually
effective press, but Ped Dick Cros-
sett brilliantly foiled the attempt
with smart dribbling.

The low scoring half ended with
Albay enjoying a 24-21 lead.

State opened its lead to 30-23
on scores by Bob and Dan Zeb,
and Crossett.

Now with a seven point margin
the State cagers played cautious
boll, taking only "good" shots. Al-
bany connected on a good percen-
tage of its foul shots to pull out a
00-50 victory.

Albany's defense was a box-and-
one, where four men played in a
zone and Dan Zeh played Potsdam’s
leading scorer, Dick Stopa, man-
to-man.

Dan zen tallied 16points, Crossett
had 14, and O'Donovan scored 13.
George Brown netted 14 to lead the
losers.

Tail Dragons invade

On Friday night, the Cortland lied
Dragons visited the Armory with an
abundance of tall forwards and
sharp-shooting guards.

Cortland jumped off to a quick
10-2 lead over the seemingly stale
Sisters. Albany continued on the
short end of n lop-sided score until
midway through the first half when
the offense begun clicking to close
out the half, trailing by only one
point, 37-80.

Albany’s Ray Weeks, who wound
up with 21 points in the contest,

called for a one-hall quorum, Sena-
tor Gene 'l‘obey, who had introduced
the original bill said he felt that a

least expected of the Senate,and that
a one-linifqllul'um would “only (be)

A bill proposing lilill $630.85 be
