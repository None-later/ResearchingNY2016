To Connect

President Gould has pre-
pared a program to imple-
ment the educational tele-
vision network with a pro-
posed UHF broadcast sta-
tion at the University at
Albany. ,

This pipn would be in conjunction
with a proposal in the 1964 Revision
of the State University Master Plan.
Establishment of open broadcast
stations were also proposed for the
other three university centers (Buf-
falo, Stony Brook, and Binghamton).

President Gould said that the ed-
ucational network could, "bring the
finest resources of the total Univer-
sity (its mostdistingulslied teachers
and scholars, notable visitors, on-
usual concerts, lectures, exhibits,

Ten Finalists Selected

At cathedral Tonight For Ambassador Program

The Golden Eye will present a
“Tribute to T. S. Eliot” at 9 p.m.
tonight in the Cathedral of AllSaints.
The program will feature a discus-
sion by Mrs. M. E. Grenarider,
Professor of English, and dramatic
readings by a student panel.

Mrs. Grenander will give the gen-
eral outline of what she conceives
to be the intellectual framework oi
Eliot’s poetry. She has attended
several seminars on Eliot and is
well qualified to discuss his works.

A student panelconslsting of flow-
ard Miller, Bruce Daniels and Susan
Murphy will supplement Mrs. Gre-
nander’s discussion with dramatic
interpretations of the “Wasteland”
and “Four Quartet." Eacti student
will portray a character from Eliot's
workand act out different scenes.

Last week a student panel includ-
ing Edith Hardy, Art Johnston, Toni
Master and liownrdMillerdiscussed
the "Absurd University, Part ll."
During the program they tried to de-
fine the purposes of a university and
a liberal arts education. They re-
lated this to Albany’s attempt to
fulfill these purposes.

The Golden Eye is a coffee house
for State students and faculty mem-
bers, and is conducted every Friday
night at 9 p.in.

State.”

The President also expressed the
hope that in the future the network
might be used by students in their
first two years of college to gain
part of their credits by taking tele-
vision courses in their own homes.
This would enable a larger amount
of students, some of whom might
have been deprived of a college
education, to receive one.

Plan Receives Endorsement

Governor Rockefeller and Dr.
James E. Allen, Jr., State Commis-
sloner of Education have endorsed
President Gould's proposal. The
Governor praised it saying, "This
plan is feasible and workable —
an exciting educational concept
ready for immediate consideration.

“This proposal can provide the
basic physical network and the con-
tinuity that is essential in any edu—
cational television system to utilize
to the fullest New York State’s vast
educational resources in the fieldof
higher education, elementary and
secondary education, and adult edu-
cation."

Under the proposed program Al-
bany would also be getting a mobile
unit to tape programs at all institu-
tions except the university centers.

Dr. Gould Pmposes  Network

University Centers

Programs could then originate at
any of the University‘s units. or
elsewhere in the State,and be Viewed
throughout the University and the
State when later broadcast over the
network.

An interconnection of the four
university centers by a two-nan
(duplex) microwave to form a "back—
bone" network is another proposal.

Six Phase Program

President Gould hopes to csnil.
lish the network in six phases in-
ginntng in 1965 and ending in 197i;

Phase 1 (1965): Link taxisillig .\l—
bany and Buffalo ETV stations by
Duplex (two-way) microwave fu—
clllties.

Phase H (1966): Build ETV station
at Binghamton and link by duplex
microwave with Albany and lsuffnlo,

Phase IV (1968): Link other Stole
University units to llilil'-Sltlllull
basic network by simplex (ono—nuy)
microwave.

Phase V (1969): Establish mobile
units (at Albany and Binghamion) to
film programs at other State Uni-
versity units for transmission il\l‘l'

Featuring ’ Traditional Realism

by M. Gilbert Willinms'

It seems to me somewhat of a
mistake to exhibit only academic
prints in an exhibition entiilted
"Twentieth Century Prints,” yet
the current offering of the Albany
Print Club being shown at the Al-
bay Institute of History and Art
does just that.

Of course, the Albany Print Club
has been, and probably always will
be, one of those conservative organ-
izations which though adnilttedlythe
sponsor of a good deal of fine
graphic art, tends to remain oriented
to those artists wliodepici their sub-
jects with traditional realism.

Yet this show of representational
pieces has a variety of artists quite
interesting, and certainly worth giv-
log your attention to. Several of the
printmakers are more \yidelyknown
for the paintings they executed than
for their prints, but that’s exactly
what makes this show of surprising
significance.

Impressionist Pointer

For instance, there are twoprints
by the American impressionist
painter, Childe Hassam. Mr. Has-
sam’s prints do not vary in subject
matter from his oils. In them, we
see delicatedly executed trees, and
New England churches.andhiseich—
ings might easily be overlooked by
most people.

They fail to show the shine de—
gree of impressionisrii that is life
distinr'liie essence of his oils, but
these iwoofchings.sodefilyskelchy,
give us :i him of 1115 for superior
0115. If you are not familiar" with
the oils, these two [Jl'llllS will serve
as a sample tensor of one of Amer-
ica’s best artists.

John Sloan is another American
artist whose paintings of the early
twentieth century one more widely
known than the [Jl‘lills ho \vasissuing
iii the same time. Slonn is repre-
sented by two etchings showing
(:umif: street Sl'GlleS of '.ll bunAmer—
ica.

Imaginative Work
His “The Lillie iii'ide” isn quaint,
comic work which portrays quite

handsome woman leave the steps of
a church after her marriage cere—

with a print showing a Venetian
scene. Quite as fine as the more
famous Venetian etchings of James
McNeill Whistler, Duveneck is an

Arts at the Movies

Kingston.  Sf ‘rdeinsky  9-
Highlight Netti Recorchngs ; f '

by Jim Schreler

it is interesting that Capitol should
name its three-volume Kingston
Trio anthology "The Folk Era.”
Why the implication that the folk
fad has ended?

Because the Kingston Trio was
Capitol‘s folk era and their expired
contract (the trio is now heard on
Decca) leaves Capitol without a
mass-drawing folk performer.

Nevertheless, thisplcture-packed
set speaks out in the past tense, and
I must agree the folk era has faded
on its lemon trees and hangingtrees.

. Sold and Rte-sold

This is riot to say that the Bob
Dylaiis will no longer produce. Only
that what folk music had to say has
been said. And in many cases re-
said. Even Joan Baez recorded a
complete Villa-Lobos work on her
latest album. That’s like Flatt and
SCl‘lll)l)S playing Duke Ellington.

While on the subject of folk inu-
sic, there‘s something new on Epic
called "The Back Porch Majority.”
The famous New Clll'lsly Minstrels
kept men in training for their group,
but the back porch group grew lin-
patieni and struck out on their own.

The result is negative. Besides
sounding like carbon copies of the
Minstrels, the group suflered from-
ilie same lack of imagination that
the latest Chrisiy releases abound
in. Their organizer. Randy Sparks,
is also on his own. The Chrisiy
Minstrels had been a prime folk
moving fort-e.

Stravinsky by Stravinsky

Jenn Cocteau and Peter Ustinov
('Uilllillli‘ with Igor Markevich in a
riiognificeni “L’llistoire rlu Soldai"
by Stravinsky. This 1918 creation
was meant to be read. played and
danced, and Philip’s siereoplionlc
recording leiives nothing bin the
visual effects out of the performi—
:incc.

Only one fault can be found in
the album-the Flanders-Black Eng-
liin version of Ramnz’ text. It can
not even claim authenticin as one
of its merits.

To get your Stravinsky with a
smile, Columbia’s “The Rake’s
Progress" fills the bill. Inspired

by Hogarth and written by W. H.

Auden and Chester Kallman, Stra-'

vinsky’s music is witty.

This set fills a vital ,part in
Columbia’s continuing "Stravinsky
Conducts Stravinsky” series. The
reason is an impressive JudithRas-
kin as Annie Trnelove. John Reardon
as Nick Sliawow, and Alexander
Young as our Tom Rakewell.

Heard are the Royal Philharmonic
and Sadlers \Velis Opera Chorus.
A handsome libretto plus notes by
Vera and Igor Stravinsky and Ches-
ter Kallman provide valuable in-
sight into the Opera’s creation and
brief life.

"Four Seasons"

Vivaldi’s “Four Seasons" has
gained a popularity that seldom
greets Baroque music. Decca col-
lected 14 Stradivarius string in—

struments to play this music in ‘

grand style.

The orchestra, containing sixvlo-
lins, two Violas and two cellos,
radiates a warm, controlled sound.
The big, foldoul album features

Vivaldi’s four sonnets, translations
and musical descriptions.

‘Goldfinger’ Fails to Measure Up

To High Standard Set By

by Paul Jonson

()ur hero is back, With more of
that "Bondbnsiing iii-lion.“ Unfor-
tunately, “Goldflngei'” lacks much
of that very quality of exciting iii--
tion \Vllll'll distinguished “From
Russia With Love.”

This is not to say that “Goldy”
is a poor film and iinenleriaining.
’l‘hc elaborate polish is there, as
is the enjoyment of seeing “old
friends.” As in a TV series,
whether the characters do anything
of consequence or not, we get to
see them again, another chapter
has been added to their lives, and
we are grateful.

The film is, however, more than
slightly disappointing offer the Iiiin
standard set by "Russia." Two
anor weaknesses cause this.

New Director

Guy llrunilton, ii director new to
the series, has given if:- u film
physically very much liketlicoihers
but which has been constructed Willi
‘ess skill. The Dlll'l,‘ here is gradual
- Iiol only at the beginning, but
throughout — and lhe events fail to
move at a rate which would keep
audiencos' attention from wander-
ing. This gliding along, riither lion
propelling the viewer through the
action, by no means ruins the film,
yet it causes it to seem at least
slow-moving.

This feeling is increased by a
lack of excitement. The plot pro-
ceeds lesurely, us though it were
enough just to see James and corri-
pany. Oh, there are action scaries—

but they are too often limited in
either conception or execution.

High- Excitement
Like a string of fireworks, the
hiin moments of excitement in
“Russia” explode in rapid succes-
sion, keeping the viewer alert and
the tension on a generally high
level. The lights in the gypsy camp

'aiid on the train, the boat chose,and

the helicopter affair follow one an-
other rapidly, with other, lesser
moments scattered in between.

Of flicse, only the gypsy episode
was played for less than its total
potential effect.

“Goldy” boosts three sequences
of substantial excitement. The pre-
crediis teaser has the speed, ac-
lion, and f'i.iirifioyiiiice that much of
the rest lacks.

lionri trying to escape in his
Aston—Martin is good film—making-
for—‘exclfonient (though an earlier
listing of the gadgets in the cur
removes all possibility of surprise
when they urn used, as the viewer
mentally checks off such, knowliig
which will follow).

The third scene that fulfills ex-
pcctoflons is Bond’s final encounter
with Oddjob.

No Grand Violence
There are other possibilities,
such ilti the laser-ray torture and
JB’s very limited but well-publi-
cized Judo bout with Miss Galore.

But none of these contain, eVen
potentially, the scope (or is it
"grandeur") of the violence in
"Russia."

Even so, they are passed off as

‘Russia’

"small stuff” which didn’t freed l3
be presented at full tension and

inherent in the plot. Bond — the
ilero — ls throughout the film sel-
dom if ever on top, or in control.
Thouin occasionally foolish (due
to females or booze), he should be

control of what he is about.

liired. lie is saved from lase; death

lie kills Oddjob by a repeat of in
earlier trick, opens the boriib but

how to strut it off. It is done for him
by a helpful scientist. -

Unable to stay free, and unable
to help himself when free, he is
rescued by a dens ox muchlna not
even he had expected. It is as much
ll surprise to him astothe audience,
to whom it seems unmotivated and
insufficiently prepared for.
_Despite these faults, “Gold-
finger" entertains -- the gloss and
side effects, such as Shirley Eaton
and the double-entendre/puns, are
pleasing enough to obscure the in-
adequacies. And there is always
“Thunderbolt” to anticipate.
