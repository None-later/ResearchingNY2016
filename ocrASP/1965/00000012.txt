The return to classes last week brought
with it the news‘of a$75increase in room
and board for next year. The increase
would be easier to accept were it not for
the gross hypocrisy of Governor Rocke—
feller’s claim to be champion of low—cost
education.

As recently as a month ago the Gover—
nor stated that,’ “One of my goals as
Governor has been that no young man
or young woman in this state with the
desire and capacity for a college educa-
tion shall be denied it for lack of per-
sonl financial means or adequate fa-
cilitie‘s.”

The fact is that during his adminis-
tration State University students have
been put under ever-increasingfinancial
burdens.

Until 1963 students could apply as
much as $350 from a Regents Scholar-
ship to the.cost of room and board.
With the imposition of tuition, this $350
had. to be made up by the student.

Now, because the State of New York-m

until this year governed by a Republican
Legislature — has not appropriated ade-

Pmposais ilo Solution

We have read the Proposed Amend—
ments to the Student Association Con-
stitution for an Interim Government
with much interest. These amendments
represent, in effect, the trend of the
ideas expressed at the Government Re-
vision Workshop, and a preview of ap—
proximately what to expect from the
final government when. it at last is
instituted.

Serving as part of the representation
to the Communications Commission for
the length of the Workshop, we were able
to see that the end of both Workshop
sessions no concrete plan of action had
been formulated. The theme of the vague
new government was a “dialogue” to be
fostered among the component parts of
the university community.

As evidenced by the unrelatedness of
the various committees meeting to de—
,vise the concept of commissions and
councils, and. for all intents and pur-
poses the absence of any dialogue among
them, we question the present action as
being the natural outgrowth of such
rough beginnings. True, compilations of
committee reports were produced, but
no follow-up was undertaken among the
various Workshop components which in—
volved any extensive numbers.

However, workshop plans have been
suspended for the present time, and a
go-between gOVernment is being at-
tempted.

ation

quate funds, the Board of Trustees of
the State University has had to raise
room rents by $65. '

Democratic Senators Jack Bronston
and Thomas Mackell have condemned
the increase as “tantamount to an in-
crease in tuition.” An increase in tuition
would have been preferable. At least
then some of our students would have
been covered by the Regents Scholarship.

As it is now, every resident student
in this school must bear the full burden
of the increase.

A government which is sincerely dedi—
cated to low-cost education is willing to
back its promises with adequate funds.
One day after the State University an-
nounced a rise in rent to pay for con-
struction, City College of New York re-
vealed a $40 million expansion program
of its own. City College charges no
tuition. It receives its money from New
York City appropriations.

We are extremely tired of hearing
about the Governor’s great intentions
for low-cost education. We want to see
positive results, not increased bills.

The idea of an interim government is
not a wholly bad one, indeed it might
possibly be the tool that could fashion
the final product to a generally work-
able stage. Rather, the institution of
another structure of Student Association
Government at this time is not feasible.
It would certainly not be the solution for
an organized and effectively-run Student
Government. ,

The present Senate is indifferent and
apathetic, preferring a good home bas-
ketball game to attendance at a weekly
Senate meeting. When a special session
was called by President Johnston last
Thursday for the sole purpose of dis-
cussing the proposed amendments and
possibly voting on them, the Senators
showed their interest by not mustering
a quorum, thereby effectively blocking
any action that might lead to their dis-
solution as a legislative body.

Would the formation of yet another
"group" of Council members combat
the obvious lack of interest now found
running rampant on this campus? We
think not.

if the details involved in making the
new revised government workable pre-
vent its implementation for a prolonged
period of time, then it is certainly worth
some delay and anticipation, if what we
get at the end is a solid, succinct Stu-
dent Government, rather than a hasty
make-shift and probably ineffective tem-
porary one.

. “Two years in Nigeria
left me aware that Ameri-
cans are very isolated and
narrowminded about the
rest of the world. They are
insulated from what is
around them.

“Now I’ll probably never be satis-
fied to stay in one place forever.
Being in Nigeria gave me wonder-
lust. I also overcame my fear of
doing anything strange and differ-
ent.

“I am now perhaps more con-
fused as to what i want to do in the
future, but 1 know that there are too
many interesting people to meet and
places to see to stay in one fixed
routine and vegetate," reflected
Buzz Walker.

Buzz has recently returned to the
United States after spending two
years with the Peace Corps in N1-
geria. He was accepted as a Peace
Corps Volunteer shortly after his
graduation from State in 1962.

Intensive Training

In the fall of 1962 he left for
three months of intensive training
at the University of California at
Los Angeles.

The lure of the idealism of the
Peace Corps was one of the factors
that interested Buzz in the Corps.
He also felt that here was an op-
portunity to travel and teach and
not be stagnated.

he felt that'he could be of more use
there. Africa was, for him, a relay.

interested in when he took aquarler

dealt wit \African history.

The climate of Africa also was
enticing (before he got there).

 

 
     

To Moldugurl

After his training Buzz flew back
to New York and then on to Nigeria.
He stayed in Lagos for a week and
then went on to Maiduguri in NOI'III-
ern Nigeria.

Moiduguri is a city of Gil-70,000
people, but is 400 miles away from
the next city .of oily size. This is
‘where he taught for the next two

years.

His first impressioll of the city
was that it was a Biblical Setting.
There were mud houses around
squares. The men wore flowing
robes and the women carried writer
jugs, called calabashes, on lhelr
‘heads.

There were two other Peace Corps
Volunteers in Maiduguri, but he
rarely got the opportunity lo lalk
to either of them. Buzz was the only
American teaching ill the leilL'llel'S’
training college there. The school
was Muslim.

He taught British English, Ari-i—
can history and African geography,
as well as being in charge of ille

basketball teams. He taught sixduys

The hardest thing for him to get

Railroad 1

While he was in, Malduguria new
railroad was opened to the city. The
“very important person” treatment
he received during the accompanying
celebration contrasted with the soli-
iaryness of other times. “i just
lildn’t know where l stood."

The Muslim school where he
taught reflected part of the culture.
it is the nature of these people to
be aloof and independent. They feel

that they have their own way of life .

and remain detached.

"At first teaching was afrighten-
ing experience,” recalled Buzz.
“The students were very courteous,
always saying ‘yes all” and ‘no slr,’
never ‘Mr. Walker.’ They tried to
be accommodating. Their entire cul-
ture is tied to a respect for age,
education, and superiors."

As do all teachers in Nigeria. he
lived in a government-owned house.
He had a cook whom he paid out of
his living allowance. “1 could not
have survived without a cook.” The
cook did the shopping in the open
air markets of the city; canned
foods to be had in Nigeria are
rather expensive.

The Peace Corps salary and living
allowance scale was lower than that
of other teachers. Consequently,
IBuzz was forced to walk, ride a
bicycle, a Honda, or use regular
Nigerian transportation systems.

The people told him that they
thought that all Americans were
rich and drove around in cars, so
they labelled him the "Poor Ameri-
can.”

A COMMON SIGHT in the streets and market places of Northern,
Nigeria is women in colorful costumes carrying colohoshu of1
water on their heads. Women in the market places and roads also

can be seen at times carrying various trinkets for sole.

One of the more noteworthy pho‘g

'. n'omona that this writer'has ob-
' served during his career at Albany ‘

State, has been a perennial debate
on the subject of the “intellectual
apathy“ on our campus. It has been
said that the student body is of such

' a substandard degree of intellectual

zeal, that the beleaguered,would-be
intellectual writing the column, or
addressing the group finds it next to
impossible to behave as anintcllec-
tual and still fit into the university
community. Dr. Boroff has chal-
lenged our position in the intellectual
world, and has gathered a noisy
following.

Folse Issue

This writer, however, thinks that
the whole issue is a' false one. In the
first place, the atmosphere on this
campus is not at all that antithch
to intellectuallsm. This writer has
had contact with institutions of "ed-
ucation” which have definitely been

Storyteller Relates the Sad Saga
Of ‘The Egg and Pork Eaters’

by Edmond Cutway

Once there was a young man who,
in his travels, saw many strange
sights and met many strange people.
Of his experiences and of the many
which he related to me, I have se-
lected one which stands out In my
memory.

I may have forgotten some of the
details but most of the story is
still fresh in my mind. Since he
himself referred to it as the story
of the “egg and pork eaters,"lhave
chosen that descriptive phrase to
entitle this account.

As the story goes, there is a
small American town named Sunya.
in this community there were three
important factions —tlle egg—eaters,
the pork—eaters, and avast majority
who ate both eggs and pork.

By virtue of the great American
tradition that what is good for many
or most is good for ali,ihe egg-and-
pork-eatillg majority were the ob-
jects of all beneficial legislatioll.

In fact, one day at the town council
meeting it was decided by a group

Only the dillnnablo situation on
the student parking lot of A'i'U (Al-
bully Transition University) could
prompt this presumptuous outburst.

The problem:

tween the number of parking places
and the number of parking stickers
issued.

2. The fact that cars without

It is hoped lliill some positive
action will he lilkull llllnlodlutoiy
to remedy this intolerable situation.

Nome; Withheld

of egg-alld—pork-eaiing officials,
that everyone must eat a diet of
both eggs and pork.

“After all,” they argued, “is it
not proven that both eggs and pork
have some very important nutrients?
Surely, then, we must require all
of our citizens to have a well-
rounded diet. For a restricted diet
may cause them to be undernour-
lslled, perhaps even unable to cope
with the world of today."

All Shall Eat

Great ulllforlnlty of nodding heads
encircled the conference able and
it was agreed, “that all shall eat of
both eggs and pork, as we have done,
so that they may retain citizenship
in the sovereign community of Sun-
ya_..

The council organized a commit-
tee to publish a handbook outlining
the minimum requirements of the
essential eggs and pork for each of
the citizens. it further stated that
if these requirements were not ful-
filled satisfactorily, the offending
citizen was subject to banishment.

Sickened Unto Dcoth

Shortly after the council's mag-
nanlmous decision, great numbers
of deathly sick people stumbled out
past lilo village limits. All of these
people were of the two minority
groups ~ the egg-eaters and the
pork—enters. The egg-and-pork-
eating majority, however, remained
healthy.

Tile failure of tile minorities to
exist under these conditions was
attributed, by the town council, to
individual weakness. and it showed

no remorse concerning its legisla-
tion. Basking in the glory of the
community strength and periodical-
ly ridding themselves of the"weak-
er” members, the citizens continued
ill this manner for a considerable
length of time.

Then one day a carrot-eater ap-
plied for citizenship in the com-
munity. After great consideration,
the council admitted the carrot-
eater.

Doom lmpondc

The new citizen at once saw the
situation and was appalled. At once
he began to develop symptoms of
the dread illness — for in order to
eat his beloved carrots. he found
that he must first eat the atrocious
eggs and pork.

Sensing impending doom and re-
alizing that many of the town's
most valuable citizens were con-
iracting the nutritional plague, the
carrot-eater spoke out.

"Let every man whose strength
lies in the eating of carrots, so eat;
and likewise with eggs; and, too,
with pork. Then our citizens will
have the food to strengthen them
and maintain them.

"Then all will be capable of
contributing to the community and
the plague will be lifted. For what
is the profit if each gains bits of
all and yet, too, loses everything?
Of what worth is he to the com-
munity then?”

Tile council listened but no change
came. it may never come. Mean-
while, the nutritional plague con-
tinues to take its ghastly toll.

sure, there are members or the

student body who see college, not so '

much as a personal educational pro-
ject but, rather, as' a four year chore
forced upon them by today's socio-
economic pressures.

lndeed, so long as the leaders of

’ our society try to realiz‘ethe utopicn

notion of universal college educ'c-i
tion, this devaluation of the univer-
sity community will continue.

At Albany .State, however, this
segment of the student body has not
imposed its ideology on the univer-
sity as a whole. The serious student

both can and does pursue his quest ' "

for knowledge. Furthermore, he
does it in concert with a sympathe-
tic portion of both the student body
and faculty, in an atmosphere of
academic freedom.

Expression

There is certainly no shortage of
attempted intellectual expression.
Tills paper carries efforts inpoliti-
cal. cultural, and aesthetic analysis
as well as its news content.

Mlmeograph papers such as “sup-

pression" and "Counterpoint" and
the more formal magazine, "Prim-
or" offer avenues for artistic ex-_
pression as well as general, criti-
cism. "Skandaion" and “The Ban-
ner” present ideological treatises
for the examination of the student
body.
Plans are under way for a new
literary magazine to be based on
this campus for distribution
throughout the state and one on-
terprising group of students is pub-
lishing a book of poetry.

Even the radio station, WSUA,
offers itself as a medium for in-
tellectual expression with such
shows as “Eye on Campus" and
this writer’s weekly discussion
series, “Tile American Forum."

it is possible that all of this ac-
tivity is pseudo-intellectuallsm,and
misdirected energy, but it is not
probable. In any event, the proper
word with which to symbolize the
intellectual state of affairs is hardly
‘apathy.’

Anxiety

This writer is at a loss to explain

the feelings of those who proclaim
that we live in an atmosphere of
intellectual apathy. Furthermore,f
have little sympathy with the writers
who have expressed these anxieties.
If there is someone who is dissatis-
fied with the state of affairs, he
should do something to rectify the
situation.

If a person is upset by the lack
of intellectual expression on cam-
pus, he should not burden the aca-
demic community with discourses
on his anguished state of mind but,
rather, should step ill to fill the gap
himself.
