encountering the same problems

“One looks in retrospect at the ,

‘first year and asks what arefeas-

’.,"It’s a hard lesson to learn. New
ReaceVCoi-ps volunteers think you
are stale whilethéy still see dreams.
The frightening thing about the sec-
ond year is that it is your last and
you may never return. '

"I soon realized that wo years
were too short, but wondered if I
would fit back into American so-
ciety when l returned. How much
do things change in two years?

 

ALMOST EVERY NORTHERN Nigerian city has walls around it.
This is a gate similar to the ones iound in Maiduguri where Bun

Wellier spent two years.

“I think I learned as much from
the non-Africans as from the Afri-
cans that were there." The first
year‘ was a period of testing. “1
found myself asking, ‘What am I
doing here?’ and ‘How did i ever
get myself into this?’ “It takes a
year to appreciate the situation.”

Traveling in Africa

During his first summer vacation
Buzz taught in a primary school
about a hundred miles south of the
Sahara. The conditions there were
extremely primitive. “Traveling in
Africa is an experience. if only be-
cause it is difficult. The people are
rather aggressive when you are
traveling and are overhelpful at
times.

“The second year was much bet-
ter. A routine was established and
I knew how far i could go academi-
cally. I knew the students - what
they wanted to learn and some of
the customs and taboos. There was
less fear.

Nigeria had become a home and i
felt sad leaving.

“All too often one only remembers
the very good and the very bad
events. I would go back tomorrow."

Touches of Modern Llie

Buzz said that the thing that sur-
prised him the most about Nigerian
people was that they were aware of
many lnslgnlflcant‘things which are
part of Twentieth Century culture

while living in primitive eurromid-'
lngs. One ,could find people in the
bush chewing gum, using bars of
soap,’ and listening to transistor
radios.

Seeing these touches of modern
life there made him realize how
little we know about Africa. He also
found that there was wildlife .in

Northern Nigeria, contrary to what

he was told during preliminary
training. 

He commented that the Peace
Corps volunteers that he metduring
his travels in Nigeria and nearby
countries were very well qualified
for the tasks that they had.

“Most of them adapt very well
to various unusual situations and
are quite flexible. They take almost
everything in stride.

Fishbowl Existence
"In igeria," Buzz observed, "i
felt like I lived in a fishbowl. I

- could not move without being watched
' — the people were curious. I could

never walk down a street without
being stopped. At times i wanted to
be anonymous.

"Yet lfelt the need for companion-
ship at other moments. More than
once I got the feeling that the walls
were crushing in on me."

There were several observations
that Buzz made about the Peace
Corps and his experiences willie

serving as a volunteer. .

He said that you learn how much
you can expect of yourself, what
your limits are and a deeper under-
standing of other people which one
could never acquire here in the
United States because almosteVery-
one here is basically the same.

“Few people here know how it
feels to be a member of a minority
group. It is hard to realize that

ones in this world." , ,
V“No causal visitor can get a true
understanding of the country. You
cannot be narrowminded if you are
going to be able to understand and
cope with the cultural shock that is
encountered in a foreign country.
It takes time to appreciate the cul—
ture that you see.

“The Peace Corps Volunteer does
not really set out to change things.
Any change within a country must
come from within, from the people.
You can show them the hows and
whys that accompany change, but the
people there arethe ones from whom
the ultimate decision to break with
tradition must come, if this is de-
sired."

emptied: ou luggage into four large
bureaus an one very small closet.

None-of us knew much more about

 

the State Universiton New York'at .

Albany than what we had read in the
little yellow- book‘. So we spent the
first day exchanging facts and fan-
cies about, our other colleges, CCEI
(Central City Business institute,
Syracuse), Fredonia, Cornell, and
the University of Minnesota, - and
speculating. One of the first ques-
tionswe asked about Albany was,
"Where to now?"

-Registration seemed to be con-
fused, unorganizedyand much too
long. But by Wednesday night, shuf-
fled and categorized, we had only
our classes to look forward to.

Information Please

We had been smiled at, cheer-
fully directed, and even invited to
the local hangout. But four days
and several classes later, we were
still asking questions: “How good
a prof. is ....?” "Should I have
taken  instead of ...?" “Where's
Detroit Annex?" And “Where can
one meet members of the opposite
sex around here?" We found satis-
factory anSWers to all of these but

intellectual Lift)...

(continued [rum page 7)

This idea is merely an extension
of the spirit of invention and pro-
ductivity. The genius of man is his
ability, when left free, to analyse a
situation which he finds distasteful,
abstract the principle of action nec-
essary to rectify the situation and
then to act on that principle to
alleviate his anxiety.

Action

if a man is concerned aboutalack
of food, than he should grow food
rather than claim that the world
owes him a living. If a student is
concerned about the fact that there
is no articulate exponent of his po-
litical view writing for the univer-
sity press, then he should articulate
Ills views instead of demanding that
the university community provide
him with a sympathetic columnist.

If a person is concerned about
intellectual apathy then he should
do something to contribute to cam—
pus intellectuaiism, rather than de-
mand that the university community
provide his ends for him.

Intellectual activity is an intensely
personal affair. There is no such
thing as a community mind or in—
tellect, there are only a number of
individual minds. Only if the indi-
viduals concerned with intellectual-
ism on campus live the intellectual
life will there be an intellectual
milieu.

To merely complain about a sit-
untion and call on others for rec-
tlilcatlon is not a constructive ac-
tion. if there are those who are
dissatisfied with the status quo then
they should join us in hectorng
the university community and attain
their ends through personal action.
