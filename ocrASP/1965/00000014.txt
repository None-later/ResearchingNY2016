with'drawal of.Arnerican ore... "1f
the United states accepts theneu-
trality of Vietnam, 1 think China
will also," he said.

“What if China were to seize
Vietnam?" he was‘asked. Dr. Vo
replied that, in that case, ‘fwe would'
ask for western help.” When asked
how much popular support the Viet
Cong has in South Vietnam, he
answered that "The Viet Cong‘force
of liberation’ is gaining more and
Inore support from the people.”

In reply to queries about the sit-
uations surrounding the Chinese
seizure of Tibet and attacks in in-
dla, he said that the portions seized
were legal possessions of China.

A former military advisor to
Vietnam rose to challenge Vo’s
assertions that the Vietnamese de-
sired American withdrawal. Vo re—
torted that he knew more about his
country than any American and that
the people fighting the Americans
were Vietnamese citiZens.

The basis for his knowledge, he
later stated, was extensive corres-
pondence and North and South Viet-
namese newspapers. lie confessed
this when confronted with the fact
that he had not visited his.country
in sixteen years.

Question: Did the United States
start the Korean War?

Answer: Perhaps yes,perhaps no.
"is the presence of Americantroops
the cause of the war in Vietnam,”
be was asked. “There would be no
war if it were not for the American
troops," he answered.
