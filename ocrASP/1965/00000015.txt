A RayView of Sports

by Roy McCloot

 

One of the most consoling and reassuring thoughts
passing through student’s minds when final exams are
in full havoc is the knowledge that intersession is just
around the corner. For approximately 40 students at
Albany, however, intersession represents nothing more
than a brief pause in between two semesters. These
are the members of the wrestling andbasketball teams.

Every year State’s winter sports teams have on their
schedules at least one contest with another school during
the intersession break. The men on these squads must
therefore remain on campus for the major duration of
this break.

These athletes, a majority of whom live in the dorm,
are limited in their activities and recreation, and more
importantly, are denied the benefits ofa restful vacation
at home.

The situation was even more frustrating this past
intersession for four frosh grapplers who never got to
wrestle in the meet, because their opponents forgot
to show up.

Possible Solution

Granted that this is all part of intercollegiate nth—
letics; we feel, however, that rescheduling these games
and matches, so that they fall either early or late in
the vacation, will allow these athletes adequate time
for an enjoyable intersession break.

Doing a really fine job for Coach Dick Sauers’cagers
is sophomore backcourtman Mike Bloom. Mike, who is
now starting in place of graduated Ray Weeks, looks
like he has finally gained confidence in his shooting and
ball-handling. In his first two games as a starter,
Mike has connected for 11 points, and has proven to be
a valuable defensive player from his guard position.

A pat on the book also goes to soph grappler Dick
Szymanski. Dick has really improved since his first
outing on the mat, even though he was victorious in
that match. In the Boston College meet Dick showed far
more speed and agility than in the Brooklyn Poly meet,
as he skillfully defeated his stronger, more experienced
BC opponent.

Possible Bid
There currently exists the possibility that Albany's
highly successful hoopsters just might receive a bid
to play in the NAIA post-season tournament. This would
be quite an achievement for a team that finished the
previous year with a mediocre 11~11 slate.

 Wednesday "night at Oneonta'the Albany State has-
ketball team tied the all-time Ped win streak of 9 in
a 57-54 triumph. The win puts State’s over-all record
at 12:3; the last time the Sauersmen lost was on De-
cember 18, when the' team, playing without leading
scorer and co-captain DickCrossett. bowed to Siena

50-48.

The record of nine wins
in a row was set in 196_1_,
when the team had such
players as Don Cohen, Jim
Oppedisano, and Dick
Crossett. '

In that year, the Feds won a total
of 21 games (a record) and set an
Armory record of 85 points in one
game. ‘

The game was an evenly played
contest, with the biggest lead en-
joyed by State being nine points.
Both teams traded baskets during

the first half, as State left the
floor at half-time with a 30-28
lead.

The game followed the same pat-
tern for the opening minutes of the
second half. Albany, however, ran
into a cold streak, and Oneonta
slowly caught up.

With 1:31 left to be played in the
game Dick Crossett fouled out.

Oneonta, which had been effec-
tively pressing the Feds, kept up
the defensive pressure until, with
a...minute to go, the score showed
Albany clinging to a one point lead.

With :05 remaining, big Jim

O’Donovan canned a field goal to
give State‘a 57-54 lead.

Oneonta failed to score again,and
the Feds hung onto the ball untilthe
final buzzer sounded.

Dick Crossett paced all scorers
with 17 points, and he was followed
in the State lineup by O'Donovan,

'wlih 16. Bob Myers was high man

for Oneonta with 16.

ents with a 20-18 effort from the
field, but they were burdened with
a cold shooting hand from the char-
ity stripe. A.B.C. meshed 21 of 23
attempts from the line for a blis-
tering 91%, while State could man-
age a 12 for 15 effort for 80%.

After trailing 28-24 at the half,
the Feds hit the comeback trail
with Sutherland and Tom Carey
leading the way. Marcus’ Jumper
moved the Pods within two.

to.kuot the score and Laurie Peck-
ham swished a fielder at 3:57 to

Senate Votes
New System

A new procedure has been estab-
lished by Senate for nominations to
elective office pending the approval
of the interim government by the
student body.

Nominations for election to Pro-
visional Council, class office, and
MYSKANIA will be made by appli-
cation on a for which is to be ap-
proved by Senate. The form will
probably include a description of
the requirements and responsibil-
ities of the position.

The form is also expected to
allow the applicant to state his
qualifications and to certify that
he has a 2.0 cumulative average.

According to S. A. President Art
Johnston, this procedure will greatly
facilitate the work of Election Com-
mission. Previously, each nom-
inee’s qualifications for office had
to be checked, and then along string
of resignations had to be sorted
through before the final list of can-
didates could be submitted to the
voters.

Having each candidate "in effect
apply" for nomination to the office
will also prevent the frequent oc-
currence in the past of students
being nominated and even elected
to office without their knowledge.

The nomination applications would
be available from February 19 to
February 23. They may be picked
up at the Student Activities Desk in
Brubacher, and at the Student l’er—
somth Office in Draper. These are
also the locations where the appli-
cations are to be turned in.

General student body elections
for the interim government will
be held Friday, February Zdtiirough
Thursday, March 4. Inauguration
Day will be Saturday, March 0.

All: Votes Tonight
(in 2 A. M. Curfew

A proposal calling for 2 p.m.
weekend curfew hours for upper-
class women will come to a final
vote at the Association of Women
Students meeting tonight at7:30p.m.

The proposal was submilted by
the women of Beverwyck hall, and
is in keeping with hours changes
made on other campuses. Tonight's
meeting is open to all interested
women.

FEBRUARY 16. 1966

Today is the final day' for voting
on the amendment to the Student
Association Constitution providing
for an interim student government.
Students may vote until 3:30 p.m.
at the Peristyle Desk.

Although voted on as one "omni-_
,bus” amendment, the proposal is
actually a series of amendments to
the Constitution. If approved by the
student body, a Provisional Council
of sixteen members wouldbeelectcd
to run student government until May

Editorial
Opinions on ilov’t Count

President Johnston’s proposal for an Interim Student
Government has been passed by Senate. With this initial
state of the process behind him, Johnston now brings
the Government Bill to the student body for its de-
cision, registered by a referendum vote.

Referendum voting facilities have been set up since
last Friday in the Lower Peristyles. Just as we ex-
pected, voting response was weak, to the point of in-
difference. This is an issue which has definite rele-
vance for the entire university community, especially
on the undergraduate level, and it is being ignored. We

-conclude that the student has taken little time to think
how effective his vote might be.

We have studied the idea of an Interim Government,
particularly for its workability andtimeliness, and have
come up with no strong case in its favor.

To institute a new government now, in view of the
final draft that will be put into effect in the near future,
seems, to us, to be a waste of time, energy and student
support.

The entire proposed structure will not produce any—
thing more effective than the present form of Senate
representation.

The time taken to set up a new government, and then
to defend it, is the time necessary to devote wholly
to the Government Plan drafted in the Workshop. Try-
ing to replace Senators with a Council often will do no
good. If a Provisional Council can be potentially effec-
tive, then Senate can also. To ram through legisation
and then foist it on the Campus does not result in con-
fidence or effectiveness.

expected to go into operation.

The Provisional Council would as-
sume the duties which Senate now
possesses, particularly in respect
to budgetary matters. The Provis’
lonal Council would make all appro-
priations for the 1965—66 academic
year.

Direct Planning

Added to these powers is Pro-
visional Council's responsibility to
“direct the course of government
planning toward the conclusion'that
a new and totally revised Student
Government shall come into exis-
tence...on or before May 1, 1965."

in discharging this duty, Provis-
ional Council would appoint an Ad-
visory Board of students who have
been active in the Government Re-
vision Project thus far.

It would also appoint ten addi—
tional members to represent the
areas which will eventually form
the Commissions of the new gov-
ernment. These areas are Aca-
demic interests (1), Communica-
tions (2), Community Programming
(3), Living Areas (3), and Religious
interests (1).

The ten appointed members would
have no vote on fiscal matters.

Lose Judicial Powers

The powers of MYSKANIA would
also change greatly if the amend--
ment is approved. It would retain
its judicial powers only until May 1,
and then would become more of a
participant in and advisor to the
new goverment. it would retain its
responsibility as “guardians of the
Freshmen Class and guardians of
tradition."

Unlike the Provisional Council,
MYSKANIA members would serve a
full year’s term.

tic or devastating and, or since
the theatre insists on tall effec-
tiveness, a more effective one
either."
