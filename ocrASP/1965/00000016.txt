‘   . toenail” February 16, I965

 
    

 

Our sincere "n at lotions and best wishes go to
our President, Dr. Evan'rB. Collins. ashe assumes the
presidency of the American Association of Colleges
for Teacher Education. ’ I

At the same time we view this news with some re-
gret, for it represents one more responsibility which
will take Dr. Collins even further away from direct in-
volvement with the students of this university,

We believe that one ofthe greatest benefits to be
derived from living in a university community is con_
tact with the ideas and opinions of its leaders. Unfor—
tunately. the man who is the leader of this partiCulm-
community is virtually unknom by the majority of its
members.

The orientation ceremonies at the beginning of the
college career, and the graduation ceremonies at the
end afford about the only opportunities for the average
undergraduate to hear Dr. Collins. Student leaders have
little more contact with him.

We are proud to know that our President is so highly

esteemed among his professional colleagues, and we

 

lmow that he is also very well received when he Speaks

Organizations Need Personnel

This university has been fortunate in
recent years in having the creative en-
deavors of its students materialize into
products of high quality. The more im-
portant of these products have taken the
form of a semi—weekly newspaper, a
closed circuit AM radio station, a lit—
erary magazine, theatrical productions,
and several independently published
mimeographed papers.

The success of these communications
and theatrical ventures has all too often
been contingent upon a small nucleus of
people who have been willing to devote
enormous amounts of time in order to
give the university somethingto be proud
of. Although the university’s population
has greatly increased, and the fields of
study widely expanded, the number of
students interested in participating in
creative activities has not grown.

The overburdening of editors, station
managers, and directors has been a
problem which the individuals involved
have always, somehow, been able to
cope with. However, in recent months,
it has become apparent that the prob—
lems created by lack of workers are
greatly hindering, and in some cases
endangering the continued existence of
the operations of such organizations as
the State University Revue, suppres-
sion, Primer. the ASP, and WSUA.

suppression, which was established as
an answer to Dr. David Boroff’s attack
upon the university’s intellectual posi-
tion, has, in the past year, served more
as a confirmation of Dr. Boroff’s criti-
cisms than as a rebuttal.

This mimeographed paper has suffered
from the lack of literary contributions
and the scarcity of people willing to put
it together. Worst of all, those fewpeopie

COMMUNICA TIONS 1

who have been willing to produce sup-
pression have not been qualified to ful-
fill the task.

Primer, which in the past has been
one of the most worthwhile Student Gov-
ernment-sponsored publications, was
supposed to come out twice this year;
the lack of literary contributions has
prevented this, and at the moment Primer
still does not have material to fill even
one issue.

The ASP and WSUA have notbeen quite
as seriously affected. Nonetheless, if
the size of their staffs was enlarged,
both of these organizations could make
considerable qualitative improvements.
With more people to take care of the
technical aspects, such as paste-ups,
typing, headline writing for the ASP or
equipment repair and news broadcast
production for WSUA, the university
would be rewarded with articles and
broadcasts of a superior quality.

The next few months will be an ex-
tremely crucial period in. the develop-
ment of the communications and the—
atrical media at this school. An in-
crease in personnel is all that is neces-
sary for a revitalization of these inte—
gral parts of the university community.

Of Experiment Programs

This past weekend laliended the
reunion of past Experimentors in
international Living. it wasastlmu-
lailng and exciting weekend.

For those of you who do not know
what the, Experiment is I will try
to explain briefly. it is an unin-
corporated organization that se-
Iects and sends your people abroad
to forty-one different counties to
live with a family for three to four
weeks and then to travel with their
brothers and sisters and their group
on an informal trip.

The Experiment receives incom-
ing Experiments from 09 different
countries. But what makes the Ex-
periment so special is nol simply
IiS exchange program but its spirit,
philosophy and intention.

Individual Basis

'l‘lie Experiment bclives that In-
ternational understanding and co-
operation can only come about on
an individual, person-lo-parson
basis.

Dr. Gordon lioycc, President of
the Experiment, gave a speech dur-
ing the weekend III which he irlod
to explain “why the Exporlmonl
is so special." ills main point was
because ii is ilnnginnilvc, lore-
sighted, and adventurous. 1 think

IF G Distributes Survey,

A mimeographed questionnaire is
now being distributed to students by
the International
campus. The [F6 hopes to use this
questionnaire in determining which
films to select for Ihecolning school
year.

Part of the form contains ques-
lions which, if answered, would in-
dicate how many people attend IFG
films, how often, and which types
they prefer.

Space is provided, also, for list-
ing specific films desired.

The [EC currently presents recent
popular films, foreign languagepro-
ducilons, Silents, and films of the
’30’s.

In planning its upcoming sched-
ule, the group will take into con-
sideration the desires of the student
body, as expressed In the question-
naire. The members, however,have
the final say in selection.

Recently the “’6 membership has

been substantially diminished. As a
result. this year’s widely varied
schedule will have to be substan-
tially reduced.

An increased number of main-
hers will allow for future film show:
lugs as substantial and varied as
those this year.

Members participate in the final
decisions on selection of the films,
as well as gaining valuable exper-
ience with the technical aspects of
projecting films.

Those interested should contact
Mike Nemschirk yin student mall,
or speak to any Il"G member. The
