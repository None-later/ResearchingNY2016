Senate Approves Appropriations ,
Recommends Graduated Student Tax

Senate was barely able to muster
a quorum Wednesday night but inan-
aged to accomplish a great deal of
business once the meeting started.
One of the first orders of business
was to suspend the quorum for the
night.

in a unanimous decision Senate
voted to recommend to the Admin-
istration that a graduated Student
Tax be charged. Under this recom-
mendation, only half of the regular
Student Tax would be charged to
part—time undergraduates, and no
charge would be made for graduate
students.

Under the present system, grad-
uates are forced to pay the regular

eligible to participate in many of
the activities which are supported
by the Tax.

Two appropriations were made,
$750 to the Torch and $425 to the
Freedom Council, which also had
its constitution approved at the
meeting.

Both proposals touched off a good
deal of debate. The Torch wanted
the money to purchase 300 extra
yearbooks. Many Senators felt that
the extra books were not necessary,
but William Colgan. Editor, pointed
out that the increase in enrollment
warranted the additional books.

Three thousand books had orig-
inally been ordered. but ihe present
undergraduate enrollment is 3500.

The constitution of the Freedom
Council received Senate approval
with little difficulty, but Senators
were much more reluctant toappro-
priute funds for the organization.
The main objection was that in
giving monetary support to a "far:-

political and social issues.

At the final vote, the majority of
Senate decided to give the group
the money, and take the chance of
