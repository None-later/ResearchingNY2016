’ Dr. Spenberg sent the letter first
to Richard Vogel, School Treas-"
urer,t with this comment‘in the
margin: ~ "1 know there is plenty
of bologna on‘this campus, but!
did not know they were doing sur-
veys onﬁit."

To which Mr. Vogel replied:
"This I believe is an academic
affair.” '

The letter' was then forwarded V

by Presldent~Sponberg to Dr. A.
F. Englebert, Dean of the College,
with the comment: "This project
seems to be in’yonr area-4 con-
tinuous ring of bologna. Please es-
tablish a course of study in this
_ meaty field.”

The dean sent the letter back to
the president with this notation:
"if this refers to link sausage, we
could make it a divisional course.
Get the pun?"

Dr. Sponberg then forwarded the
letter to Dean John Howe, head of
the law school with the question:
"Would the sausage course fit your
curriculum, since you are training
pork-barrel specialists?"

To which the law school dean
responded: "Would the course in
sausage stuffing count as a physi-
cal education substitute?”

And, at this point, the matter of
beginning a sausage-stuffing course
at WU was dropped, probably not
to any great dismay to either stu-
dents or administration.

"THIS SPORTING LIFE" stars Richard Harris and Rachel Rob-

iormonce. It is being shown tomorrow night by IFG in D 9.

'Requiem for a IIosvywelgIrt’ Opens
IFG Double Feature for Weekend

This weekend IFG will present
two fine films in Draper 349. Shows
will be at 7 p.m. and 9:15 p.m. and
the admission will be 35¢.

The first of these films, “Requiem
for a Heavyweight," which will be
shown tonight. was directed by David
Merrick and stars Anthony Quinn,
Jackie Gleason, Mickey Rooney,and
Julie Harris.

Quinn gives a moving portrayal
of an honest, if slow-witted fighter.
Gleason plays his manager, who in-
tentionally overmatches him and
tells the syndicate he will not last
four rounds.

Quinn, who has not been told,
shocks them all by taking a beating
for well over four rounds. In the
course of the fight Quinn almost
loses his left eye and he is told he
cannot fight again.

“This Sporting Hire,” a British
film, will be shown Saturday. The
film concerns a sensational young
rugby player whose talent is second
only to his ego. Unmindfulofothers,
he sets out to attain everything he
wants, including his landlady.

For his portrayal of the arrogant
sportsman, Richard Harris was
nominated for an academy award.
