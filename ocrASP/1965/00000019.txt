It's too bad the lines will be twice as long and the ticket supply hall as large on the New Campus.

Government Ilepenlls [in Support

We have been appalled by the total
lack of interest on the part of the stu—
dent body toward its government. We
can only guess that it is the result of
a complete unawareness of the impor-
tance of this government.

it cannot be denied that this year’s
Senate has ﬂagrantly violated the re-
sponsibility with which it was entrusted.
It has been a farce of representative
government - indeed of government at
all, but this does not exonerate the in-
dividual student from concerning him-
self with the government.

Regardless of how incompetent Senate
has been, it remains the body under which
all, student organizations and services on
this campus operate. Anyone who sees

Pete Seeger next weekend, attends apro- ’

duction of the University Theatre, or
reads this paper on Tuesdays and Fri-
days has a stake in student government.

Senate is also the means through which
students are chosen to serve on faculty-
student committees which help determine
University policies in many areas affec-
ting student life. If there is dissatisfac-
tion with these policies, or with the stu-

dent representatives in the committees,

Senate is the place to take the complaint.

It is true that -Senate is at fault in
not carrying out its obligations. But the
fact remains that a government is only
as good as the people it represents want
it to be.

lines Result From Poor Planning

Several days ago the line phenomena
appeared in the Peristyles again. Per-
iodically. whenever a really fine per-
forming artist is scheduled to arrive
on campus, the Peristyles are crammed
full of hopefuls waiting hours to obtain
a ticket.

Such was the case for two days earlier
this week. Pete Seeger, one of Folk
Music’s “greats” will be presenting a
concert in Page Hall next weekend. The
outcome of the ticket sales device for
this performance was staggering lines.
at times running to a width offour people
and stretching far and away down the
Peristyles to the neighborhood of the
Bookstore.

We can only question Music Council,
who is sponsoring the concert about the
logic employed in selecting Page Hall
to be the scene of Mr. Seeger’s per-
formance.

When the University Calendar was
planned last Spring. it was early enough

to reserve the Armory for this event.
Instead, it. was thought that Page Hall
would be adequate to handle the expected
crowds.

When Peter, Paul and Mary arrivedin
this area last year they performedinthe
Armory to a huge crowd. Their following
in folk music is certainly no greaterthan
is Seeger’s. For Homecoming, the Ar-
mory was again rented to present two
lesser-known Folk names. Then, when
the University is given a chance to hear
a truly outstanding Folk artist, enjoy-
ment is severely limited to the chosen
900, and they are rustled into lines and
crowded into Page on‘the night of the
performance.

The conditions of this concert are
beyond hope, but, in the future, better
planning and a fuller realization of
student tastes should be employed in.

formances.

Bogota, Columbia.

“Gracie,” as her name has been Anglicized,
lives in a slum section of Bogota, and she.
along with a sister and four brothers, dwells
in a tiny, run—down home with her mother and
father. Her father is a carpenter by trade,
and mmle the few pieces of furniture which

Deccmbrm, 1963. Through the Foster Parents
plan, «he receives food, clothing, and medical
care for both herself and her family. Because
of this, she has been able to attend school for
the pus-I year, and does quite well.

In spite of the help they receive, however,
the family is still a long way from having
everything they need. The continued support
of Sl‘NYA through the next year will do a
grant dual to relieve their burden of poverty.

Misquotes Forum Speaker

To the Editors:

An article appearing In your Is-
sue of February 12, regarding the
appearance on campus oi Dr. Vo-
l‘liaub-Minb, Vietnamese scholar,
quoted Dr. V0 as saylng, "’I‘hc Viet
Cong 'for‘ce of liberation’ is gaining
more and more support from the
people.“

This is a direct misquote, pos-
sibly arising from the difficulty
with which Dr. Vo was understood.
What Dr. Vu did say Ia quite dif-
fer'cul lr‘uln what appears in the
article to be merely n “propaganda
Ilnn" supporting the Vth Cong as
“W “liburators” of South Vietnam.
In far'l what was stated and re-
umphnslzed mme ilmcnlhatcvcnlng
was that the term “Viol Cong" in
a slang wurll,similar10"Curnmin,”
used by the Saigon Government to
slgnlfy the "National Liberation
Front," which Dr. Vu continually
referred in an lhe “Front of Lib-
eration." ’I‘hc NLIv‘ in a South Viet-
namese po 1 I l I c a 1 organization

it is unfortunate that the reporter
was so unfamiliar with the political
facts of South Vietnam that be into-
understood Dr. Vo'n statement and
did not rcwgnlzc his reference to

the Viet Cong as the “trout of

the phrase as the “force of lIlIl-lII-
