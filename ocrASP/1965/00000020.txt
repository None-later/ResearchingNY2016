Here’s his experienced reasoning:

li a person is always punctual, or
early, he obviously must have some
time on his hands in order to make
sure that he is on time.

if a person has extra time, and
uses it only to get somewhere punc-

The" depiction of the nude female
has become passe in the art world.

, Certainly it is still oi some inter-

est, and Well it should be, but the
portraying of the coinpletely nude
male n art has beeh‘limlted.

We are accustomed to seeing the
female nude portrayed in art. Such
realistic executions of the female
form as those of the Belgian ar-
tists Paul Delvaux and Rene Ma-
gritte fall to cause as much a stir
as does the representation oi the
male genitals in modern art.

it is for, this reason, primarily,
that artists even of our liberal age
of Genet and Rechy novels fall to
execute many. works containing the
male nude.

Extensive in Greek Art

Throughout the history oi art the
nude male figure has not been a
subject for the majority oi artists.
The use of the male nude was ex-
tensive in ancient Greek art. The
Greek vases, the sculpted Kourol,
and- such classical sculptures as
“Paseidon," bear witness to the
Greek interest in the subject of
the male nude.

Sculpture declined in Roman art
when the male genitals were given
fig leaves. The fully nude male form
did not emerge until the Renais-
sance. The closest to the male nude
executed during the Middle Ages
was the depiction oi Christ on the
Cross, where somehow a bare chest
does occasionally appearn

As the Renaissance developed in
ltaly, not only were male nudes
represented in many works but they
lacked the fig loaf motif given them
by the Romans.

in many instances such :15 P01-

Naked Men" and the works oi
Michelangelo, including his Sistine

Chapel paintings and the sculptures
“David” and "The Dying Slave"
realistic nudes were depicted.

Hide and Seek

Yet the genitals still managed to
play a hide-and-seek-game in such
works as “The Expulsion from
Paradise” of Masaccio, and the
more Medieval works of the North-
ern Renaissance sncli as the Adam
panel of the Ghent altarpleue by
Jan and Hubert Van Eyck, and the
Durer print “Adam and Eve."

In the interim between the Renais-
sauce and the present time, the
totally male nude has, of course,
been depicted. We see this in the
works of the sculptor Auguste Rodin,
the American painter Thomas Eak-
ins, the early works of Rockwell
Kent, the lanky sculptures of Wil-
helm Lehmbruck, the devised—wire
works oi Alexander Calder, and the

Not Complete, Attention  ,

No artl'st seems to have forgot-
ten the subject, butiew artists
have given the completely nude male-
iigure a great dmount of attention.
Certainly. sculptors have been forced
by the limitation oi their medium to
portray the male‘iigure more con-n
sistently than have painters or print-
makers who can veer from the male
subject and paint towns, still-lifes,
portraits, and other subject includ-
ing the nude female.

Today though, artistic prudery
cannot exist. Just as there exists
no unpoetlc word, so there exists
no unartistic subject. What perhaps
may be hard to accept is how the
figure is used. _ _

In a recent work of artist Greg
Curnoe which was reproduced in
a recent "Art international” we see
a depiction of a simplified phallus
descending upon a reclining female.
Though this work is contemporary
to our age, it is not unprecedented.

Da Vinci did some highly inter-
esting anatomical drawings of coitus
in notebooks. Curnoe’s paintings
may be highly provocative, but he
handles his two subjects with the.
direct and simplistic honestly ap-
propriate to modern expression.
Another modern artist, Kendall
Shaw, has depicted the total male
nude in silhouette lifesize.

Writers and Artists

Certainly writers have been given
extensive freedom with words. it is
only right that the artist, too, have
the freedom he has to a great extent
been unwilling and unable to use
completely for graphic expression.

It is time the depiction ofthe total
nude figure came off the walls of
the lavatorles of America and onto
the canvases and drawing papers of
American artists. It is a brave and
bold freedom which any artist has
the choice oi using.

Dr. Pettit stated.", an attempt to approach Ethan From
from the epic theatre point of “view,” v

Such a view stresses the people, landscape, and en-

with the aid of one hundred projections shown before ,
and during the» show. ,Such 'an approach as this takes V '
e beyond the confines of the stage to the New England
countryside. . ' ..

' Suicide -
Dr. Pettit does not, however, neglect the plot of
the story being presented. The play opens when Ethan,
a young man, is patiently enduring life with an embit-
tered wife, Zeena. His existence is lonely and desolate.
When Mattie, the maid hired by Zeena, enters the 'mee
household, complications arise. Although Ethan is now
an older man caring for a miserable crippled wife, he
cannot deny the love which has grown for the servant. '
The only end to such a situation seems to be suicide. and,
sharing a sled, they plunge head first down the side of
a mountain.

Brechtiun Devices

The simple plot becomes a much larger — almost
historical - statement under Dr. Pettit’s direction.
He has disregarded the realistic and made full use of
theatricaldevices and the stage to convey Ethan’s story
in an internalized presentation of a man’s life and
thoughts. In so doing, Dr. Pettit has utilized many
Brechtian devices and techniques of the theatre. The
sled scene has a “neutral” setting. Hence, attention
is directed to the mind of the character. Abstract
projections during the scene further emphasize the

complex processes of Ethan’s mind.

1964 Recordings Revive Many Operas
Cindy, Bedrooms, Boris Featured

by Jim Schrelor

The year 1964 presented numer-
ous operas, especially stereo rar-
files.

Take, for example. the first
"adult" opera (two bedroom scenes
in the first act), "L'lncoronazione dl
Poppen" by Monteverdi. Angel inan-
aged to slice the worklnallposslble
places to get it on two records, but
300 year-old Monteverdi loses none
of his vigor here.

Characterization takes hold be-
cause of a welding of two elements:
Originality in presentation and com-
petent singers. Monteverdi has yet
to reach full height in his current
rcnulssnnce.

Italian Cinderella

The ltallnu version of the Cin-
doi'elln story lost little when Rossini
decided it would puss as an opera.
Gone are the rats. mice and pump-
kin (replaced instead by a chorus),
and inserted as a scene in Prince
Cliui‘mlng's wine cellars.

Our Cinderella is Guillletta Sl—
mionulo. a supi‘ﬂllu of varying cap-
abilities, backed by Paolo Mouiar—
solo, Ugo Berelli and conductor
Olirlei’u dc l’ulu‘lills. Since you are
familiar with the Doublemiut coin-
mcrclul, you know well one of the
opura's melodic highlights.

Strauss Ccntannlol

The second Deutsclie Grammo-
plume offering for the Richard
Strauss Conlennlul is "Die Frau
olmo Shutlen" us I'L'CUl‘il0fl live at
the Munich National Theater. This
opurn, with fantastic singing coin-
plexlties unfolds symbolically.

The theme is Inunnn lui‘illlly.
An interpretation must be personal.
One cannot help being’ aware. how-
ever, of witnessing the Strauss and
Von llofl‘inunritliul operatic achieve-
mcul.

Social Studies
liorls Godunov is the only suc-
cessful social and psychological
study in romantic music. it is n
i‘uru example of when two diverse
elements such its social science and
art can combine to give fertile lll-

sights info lath.

Columbia's recording of Boris
is a satisfactory one. The superior
chorus plus a brilliant George Lon—
don offsels noisy surfaces and dull
stereo. Still this Bolshoi Theater
production must attract attention for
authenticity in most detall, includ-
ing ii clarification of Mussorgsky's
intentions.

Anli-liem and the

by Larry Epsioln

One of the genres Iliatlias evolved
from the philosophy of Existential-
ism is the novel in which the pro-
tagonist is :in anti—liero. An anti-
liei'o is an individual who does not
conform to the reader’s precon-
ceived nations as to what a hero
should be.

A hero, at least popularly, should
be virtuous, maintain a healthy, if
not overubumlant relationship with
the opposite sex, and, most of all,
be someone with whom it is worth-
while fur the render to identify.
’I‘lie anti-hero, by contrast, is run-
corous, rude, and disturbed. lie is
oul of step with the world.

The Ginger Man

For example, Sebastian Danger-
field, in J. P. Donlenvy's Joycean
novel “The Ginger Man," is a jolly
follow caught up in a world with
which he can't cope. llin numerous
shortcomings include u contempt
for Ihe feelings of his wife, his
affinity for liquor, his evasion of
debts, and his general adversity,
as exemplified by his unwilllugess
to study for his upcoming luw ex-
ninlnatlon.

Another contemporary example
of an unit-heron is Stern in the
novel of the some home by Bruce
Jay Friedman. Stern ls on the out-
side of the world looking in. Little
in life is meaningful to him. His
main source of frustration is a

star stereo production of “Rode-
llnda": Sllch-Randall, Maureen
Forrester, Helen Watts, Alexander
Young, lloessl-Majdau and John
Boyden.

The typical static lath Century
plot receives no relief from “an-
del's music. Actually, the whole
opera is a letdown from so many
of Handel’s similar oratories.

Brian Pi‘iestman leads the Vienna
Radio Orchestra in unknown music
that deserves to remain so. And no
performance can rise above such
a limitation.

Modern lion

neighbor who makes him feel
ashamed of his religion and whom,
he believes, has violated his
(Stern's) wife.

Why?

Why is the anti-hero genre so
popular? These novels express re-
pressed longings of the people who
read them. The anti—hero dares to
assert himself, to take the clamp
off his id.

Existentialism says that it is up
to the individual to mold his own
existence from the shattered pieces
he finds around him. Many people
can’t stretch their character into
the pattern that, according to the
Exisleiitiulists, they must, because
they are held back by certain rules
of society, such as the personality
that family and friends have already
assigned them. The anti-hero novel
lets them be what they feel they
ought to.

Solid philosophical impact is an-
other reason for the popularity of
this genre. The anti-hero novel
appeals to those members of so-
ciety, such as the adolescent, who
are seeking metaphysical truths,
searching for a meaning in life.
This search is a dominant theme -
in anti-hero novels.

The anti-hero genre will continue
to exist only as long as the pre-
dominant intellectual mood ls ex-
istential. Then it will join its an-
cestors in the annals of literary
history.
