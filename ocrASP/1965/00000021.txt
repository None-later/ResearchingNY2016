Zeh Brothers Give Peds
‘Talented Hardcourt Duo

by Dan Oppedisono

Bobby and Danny Zeh are two good reasons why the
Albany State basketball team is having one of its better
seasons in recent years. Bob,the playmaker of the team
and leader in assists. is currently average 6.0 points

a game. Dan is averaging
second in regounding.

Jefferson Central High
School, Jefferson, New
York, is the alma mater
of the two brothers. At
Jefferson theyboth lettered
in baseball, basketball, and
cross-country. _

Bobby, the older of the two, stands
6’ and weighs 170‘pounds. lletrans-
ferred from Cobleskill in order to
complete his business courses and
to pursue a teaching career. Bob
hopes to begin teaching in Septem-
ber.

Bobby’s major interest besides
basketball is swimming, and in the
summer he is a life guard at alocal
swimming pool. At State, Bob has
been on the basketball team for two
years and in the spring he plays
intramural softball.

Bob broke into the starting line-
up in the middle of last season,
and soon became a.favorite of the
fans because of his aggressiveness
on the caurt. When asked about his
biggest thrill, Bob stated that the
current win streak has been his

' biggest so far.

Danny, a strapping il' a" 185
pounder, has been a member of the
basketball team in each of his four
years at State.- When the math major

Danny feels that his biggest thrill
was the 75-40 win over Slena in
the beginning of the season. Dan
also scored 88 points in the Marist
game, setting :1 Capitol City Tour-
nament record. As a result of his
fine performance, lie was a co-
winner of the Most Valuable Player
award.

in reference to tile upcotningBuf-
faio game at the Armory tomorrow
night, Bobby was quoted as saying:
“I thillk we have a good chance to
win if we play it good game. We
have to play two good halves and
we're just about due for two good
ones."

Danny stated: "it will be a close
game and we'll have to play one of
our better games to beat them.

Sports ’

 

 

There are two types of fencing practiced by the

team: foil, where light equipment and weapons were
used. and sabre, where the weapons‘ are heavier and

the scoring is different.

Only men are allowed to

participate in sabre fencing.
The SUA team practices foil fencing in lower Pierce

Hall on Wednesdays, and

sabre fencing in the Bru—

bacher game room on Saturdays.

Because of the lack of fencing teams in the area, the
SUA team has to compete against various clubs that are
far more experienced than the three-year-old State

squad.

A call to arms has been proclaimedby the SUA Fenc—
ing Team. This merry band of kindly cut—throats is

_ open for increased membership, and is inviting male

and female alike to join their ranks in defending the

honor of Albany.

Unlike defenders of old, thee sleep-lovers never
do battle at dawn,‘choosing the more civilized hours

of 7—9 p.m. on Wednesdays
to ill one another.

and 9—12 a.m. on Saturdays

Sunday the fencers play host to North Adams, Mass,
at 2:00 p.m. in the Bru game room. Team capain Rob-
ert 'I‘amm is confident that once people realize the
mental and physical benefits and enjoyment derived
from competitive fencing, there will be a much larger

turnout of fenccrs at State.

Those who are interested in joining the team are
invited to attend the Wednesday meeting.

The mostysuccessful State representative at the
recent Buffalo tournament was freshman bowler Tom
Piotrowski from Schenectady.

Tom, an exhuberant redhead, rolled a 1681 six-
game set (187 norm) that qualified him for the in—
dividual finals, probably to ‘be held in Minneapolis,

Monitors Protest

Vietnam Intervention

A group of about twenty-
five people gathered ll’l
front of the State Capitol
last Saturday to protest
United States intervention
in Vietnam. They began
their march at 2 p.m. and
proceeded single file down
State Street to the Post

Office.

When they reached the Post Office
they paraded around carrying signs
calling for a cease fire in Vietnam
and a United Nations force to keep
the peace. After their picketingthey
returned to the Capitol and dis-
persed.

Many State students and profes-
sors took part in the demonstra-
tion. Dr. Richard Wilkie, of the
Speech Department, played songs
on his banjo.

State Student Organiler

Gary Delain, a student at State
and one of the organizers of the
march, give these reasons for his
part in the march. "We don't stand
a chalice of winning the war inViet-
naln. The longer we wait the better
chance the Communists have ofwin-
ning. We want a negotiated settle-
ment with a United Nations peace
force."

The march was part of a nation-
wide demonstration sponsored by
“Women’s international League for
Peace and Freedom." The League
furnished the marchers with two
pamphlets, "Some Facts About Viet-
ham," and “Memo on Vietnam,”
which were distributed to people on
the street.

The brochures gave the back-
ground and nature of the war. his-
torical alld political perspectives
and alternatives of the war.

Sicnu Students Protest

A group of Slena students were
also present, protesting the march.
’l‘hey followed the demonstrators
carrying their own signs. One of
their leaders said tiley were pro-
testing the march because they felt
that “if we withdrew from Vietnam
we would be conceding to the Com-
munists again.”

Two Slena students, who covered
the story for the Siena newspaper
alld radio station, have planned a
special program on the march. Gary
Delain and Philip Lord will repre-
sent the view of the picketers and
several Siena students will defend
their point of view affirming the
continuance of the war effort.
