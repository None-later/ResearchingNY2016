72-60 atArmory

by Mike Farenell

The State frosh cagers
couldn’t hold onto their 30-'
2t halftime lead and bowed
to Albany Pharmacy on Sat-
urday night, 72-60, in the
Armory.

Both teams swapped baskets early
in the first half, as Albany’s Larry
Marcus and Denny Elkln and Phar-
macy’s Rick Jansen were hot for the
two teams.

With the score knotted at 24-24,
Tom Carey, Laurie Peckham, and
Tom Doody each hit for baskets for
the Feds, putting the Sisters six
points up. Pharmacy came back
strong to pull within a point at the
half.

The two teams continued trading
baskets until 13:49 when Jansen hit
on a free throw to give the visitors
a 41-40 bulge.

From the midway point of the
second half, the Pods could connect

ALBANY. 3, NEW

YORK

Okay: Nomination. Form

Senate met for the last
time Wednesday night and
in a short session approved
unanimously the nomina—
tions form for class offi-
cers, the Interim Govern—
ment and MYSKANIA.

The forms for class officers and
Interim government were drawn up
by President Art Johnston and the
MYSKANIA sheet by the members
of MYSKANIA. They can be picked
up at the Student Personneli and
Student Activities Offices.

A student must return applica-
tions today in order to have his
name placed on the ballot.

Senate also approved a resolution
by Senator Al Bader for Alumni
Board Elections and nominations.
The resolution established the pro-
cedure for nominations, which is
the some for other offices, and the
time and place for elections.

WSUA Constitution

After the question of nominations
were completed, Senate turned to
the new constitutions for WSUA and
International Student’s Association.

Vice President Al Smith ques-
tioned the clause in \VSUA's consti—
tution which gave the station mana-
ger “dictatorial” powers.

Murray Schisgal’s one-
act play, “The Tiger,”
presented here earlier this
year, has been selected to
be performed at the ninth
annual Yale Festivalof Un—
dergraduate Drama. The
Festival will be held March
6—8.

Last fall Dr. l’ettlt, Chairman
of the Department of Drama and
Speech, was contacted by the Yale
Festival committee. The Univer—
sity was invited to submit a script
and general production Sl'liellle. The
invitation was accepted, and the
"The Tiger” selected on the basis
of its compact production unit; a
two-role company and small tech‘
nical crew.

The play is under the direction
of Professor James Leonard. Pro-
duced successfully off-Broadway
sovorni years ago, "The Tiger" is
a comic but also serious examina-
tion of lmmun aspirations and
foibles.

portrayal of the male-female rc-
lutlonship with n reversal of the
dominating personalities.

Lust your over four hundred stu-
donts from several Americnnrdaten
and Quebec participated in the
Drama Festival. The plays pm-
sontod are either one-act or cuts
from longer piuys.

' WSUA, defended the constitution by

pointing out that one person has to

have these powers to make "split-
second” decisions.

With the question answered, Sen-
ate proceeded to validate the Con-
stitution.

No discussion arose over the con-
stitution for the International Stu-
dent’s Association and the Senators
unanimously approved it.

President Johnston announced the
resignation of Senators liarry Gard-
ner and Carolyn Schmoll. Both sen-
ators resigned because of what they
called the farce Senate was be-
coming. At last week’s meeting,
they led the heated debate against
the method in which the new gov-
ernment was being passed.

Senator Gardner was chairman of
Finance Committee and was re-
placed by Senator Deborah Fried—
man.

Senator Friedman announced at
the meeting that the budges of Dra-
matics Council and the Department
of Recreations had been frozen by
Finance Committee.

ctercndom Passed

At the conclusion of the meeting
President Johnston announced the
results of the referendum. The final
tabulation showed 806 students had
voted with 728 for the Interim Gov—
ernment and 75 against with Sab-
stentions.
