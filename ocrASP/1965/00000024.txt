Tentative plans for aJunior Class
event were made at a class meeting
held Thursday, February 18. The
plans include a semi-formal dinner
and dance to be held at Herbert's,
Saturday, March 13.

Both floors of the restaurant are
to be rented! and a band will be pro-
vided. The dinner will consist of a
smorgasbord. -

The Arrangements Committee
headed by Pep Pizzillo is choosing
favors and programs for the event.
Lynn Kurth, Maria Tucci and Maria
Maniaccl are also members of the
committee.

Other committees working on
preparations are Publicity, chaired
by Karen Bock, and Tickets, under
Steve Curti.

The class event is replacing
Junior Weekend because of the poor
attendance and loss of money that
accompanied the previous Junior
Weekends.

It is hoped that by having this
one event expenses would be cur-
tailed and help save class money
for next year's senior event.

~ , A'student boycott'of Boss?

,ton Universityte bookstore

“ended (last week with no
immediate results. The
students were protesting
the profits made by'the
store on all educational
materials.

Before the leaders of the group

v decided to ,end the boycott, a rally

was staged in front of ,the Student
Union. Students carried signs read--
1113 "A Free University in a Free
Society.”

Boston newsmen and television
cameraman were on the scene to
hover the plcketing, giving the stu-
dent's efforts city wide coverage.

The boycott was organized by the
Ad Hoc Committee for University
Reform. The Committee's griev-
ances centered around the fact that
the bookstore makes a profit on
book sales. They called for a 10
percent discount, eventually to be
equal to the bookstore' 5 total profits.

Faculty-Student Committee
Included in the proposal was the
formation of an administrative-fac-
ulty-student committee to study the
problem.

The admfhistration yielded to the
group’s demands and formed such a
committee composed of members of

the student government and faculty. ,
