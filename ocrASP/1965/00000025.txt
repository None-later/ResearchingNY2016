Last week a new publication appeared
on campus, published by two individuals
using their own time money and energy.
The end product was a mimeographed

the entire student‘body in the Peristyles.

Almost immediately after the sheets’
appearance, these two individuals were

UFC President Explains
Aims of Organization

To the Editors:

At last Wednesday’s Senate meet-
ing (2-17-65), there was much dis-
cussion as to whether the Freedom
Council of' this university was in
actuality a “political faction.” Des-
pite the fact that our budget was
passed, it occurred to me that per-
haps other members of the student
body would feel the same way some
of our Senators feel.

Thus, i thought it my duty to ex-
plain to you all the aims, purposes,
principles, and policies of Albany
State’s Freedom Council.

When this group was formed, the
founders wished to establishagroup
that would inform this University
about the issues of Civil Rights.
This was to be done by means of
speakers, movies, lectures, and any
other media that could be used.

At the present time, these pur-
poses have not changed, nor will
they change. They have been broad-
ened to the extent that will enable
us to bring to this campus an ex-
ample of every aspect of the Civil
Rights question. This will entail all
views from Rev. Martin Luther
King to (the late) Malcom X; from
President Lyndon Johnson to ex-
Governor Ross Barnett.

We are in existence to inform
you that there is such a thing called
Civil Rights, that there is discrim-
ination in this country. that there
are such things as slums and ghettos.

But, we will not tell you what to
do about it. Your actions as indi-
viduals in this issue should be gov-
erned by your own thoughts, All we
can do and will do is tell you what
is happening.

If there are any questions that
you, as a member of the University
Community may have, talk to any
member of Freedom Council. l’m
sure they will answer any ques-
tions you could have.

Music Council Criticizes
ASP Editorial on Seeger

To the Editors:

Your editorial of February 19
shows the lack of research and back-
ground ihat generally appears onthe
editorial page each week. Music
Council never intended that "Page
Hall would be adequate to handle
the expected crowds.”

After investigating several pos-
sible auditoriums, Music Council
concluded that it would not be feas—
ible to use them for concert. First
of all, the expense would be out of
proportion to the artist’s fee.

This expense involves a) rental
of ball, b) rental of chairs (about
5,000) and the accompanying labor,
and c) hiring of guards and other
security procedures.

Secondly, an artist's contract is
dependent upon the location of the
concert; the fee will increase pro-
portionately with the size of the
hall and the audience. This would
in turn involve a great expense to
the student who would have to pay
upwards of $3 a ticket plus student
tax, instead of the usual fee of tax
card alone or an extra 50¢.

Also. an artist will not always
perform in an armory,or extremely

large hall due to the poor acoustics,
which the Armory definitely has.

Music Council was just as dis-
appointed to refuse students admis—
sion as those students were who
could not~obtaln tickets. To help
alleviate this situation, 150 chairs
were added to the pit and even the
stage, bringing the total number oi
tickets sold to 1100.

A conscientiously informed stu—
dent should realize that the inade-
quate facilities ofthe hall are beyond
our control and that we have done
everything in our power to make
the situation as bearable as possible.

Dr. Sauers Thanks Fans
For Enthusiasm at Game

To the Editors:

On behalf of the members of the
Varsity basketball team lwish to
thank the student body for their
extremely gratifying display ofpar-
tlsan enthusiasm exhibited during
the game with the University of
Buffalo Saturday night.

Such support has previously been
witnessed only at contests with our
"naiural" rival Slena.

l have always felt that the athletic
learns of an institution can do more
to unify the student body than any
other single force... to create a
price in the University... a school
spirit.

Saturday’s game was along stride
in this direction. Successful teams
and an abundance of loyal fans are
traits that complement each other.
A growing university should nourish
a supply of each.

ohoarsol Opportunities
Not only does it give each player
a chance to hear what his part
sounds like, but one can see how a
particular section of theband blends
with another for greater harmony.
Besides the differences in various
sections of the band, one can hear
the blending of the two, three or
four different parts of each section.
Having gone through the work with

careful attention to sectional detail, ‘

Mr. Hudson then leads the entire
hand through the piece. Even now,
however, the work is not completed
without several stops and much
repetition.

Flnol Palilh

The band is stopped where cer-
tain points of intonation or dynamics
need.special work. This is the final
polish that the whole band needs,
for if the dynamics are not paid
particular attention to, the per.
formance will be very nearly mean-
ingless. , ,,

Finally, after all of this rehear-
sal of and on particulars, Mr. Hud-
son puts the band to the test by con-
ducting the whole piece. This, just
as the concert performance, is the
end product in the process of a
creative art.

lnterweavlng of Ports

Just as every artist must start
with the basic steps of his par-
ticular art and work toward a fin-
ished product, so a band in its re-
hearsal works up from the indi-
vidual part to the complex inter-
weaving of parts that makes music
come alive.

The stuuents that make up the
band come from many and varied
backgrounds. Freshman instrumen-
talists are often surprised to find a
totally different situation here than
in their high schools. .

S. ll. Theatre

{In many ways, things are mord
casual, with no emphasis or inter-

,est in gaudy uniforms, majorettes,

or circus-type drill routines. Re-‘
hearsals are run, however, with
professional insistence on absolute

'quiet and attention.

_ High Calibre Music

Musical compositions are of the
highest calibre, and often are more
challenging than anything the fresh-
men have ever played before. Be-
ginning players from small rural-
high schools often findthat they are
in a different world.

An example of such a freshman
is Lee Lovallo, a trombone player,
who would probably be a music
major if one presently existed. His
studies in the music department
include courses in music theory,
which supplement his ability in com-
position.

During the first semester, he
submitted the manuscript score and
parts of tWO compositions for band,
which were played through and brief-
ly rehearsed. in addition,he teaches
trombone at Milne and studies pri-
vately with the first trombonist of
the Albany Symphony.

Concert Culminates Work
The end result of all of the work
by State’s amateur musicians is the
concert. The verdict of the re-
viewer is anticipated. A review of
a recent band and orchestra concert
here gave favorable observations.

The performance was said to be
“high calibre” showing “a fine
mastery of music” and "beautiful
resonance and tone quality.”

“It was an enjoyable and exhil-
arating musical experience” and
“for those in attendance, at least,
the apprehension of going to a lo-
cal performance doubtful of hearing
well-performed music has now been
dispelled.”

State Band Achieues Rapid Progress
Conductor Hudson Gratiﬁed at Result

The band of Albany State has pro-
gressed “even better than 1 ex-
pected," according to Mr. William
Hudson, conductor.

"We began the fall semester in
1963 with around thirty players, a
spotty instrumentation with many
crucial instruments missing, and a
concert scheduled for the first week
of December.

“The soul-searching decision was
whether to play that first concert

'Ethan Frome’

or not. I decided that it mustbe
done, since public performance is,
a necessary ingredient for vitality
and morale.

First Obligation
“Our first obligation is, after
all, to the participating students.
The concert generally was success-
ful and well received, and since
that time each concert has been

significantly better than the one

an Attempt

To Place Play in Framework of Epic Form of Brecht

by Debby Friedman

“The production of'Ethan Frome’
is an attempt to place a play written
in a fairly realistic form into an
epic," said Dr. Paul Bruce Pettit,
director of the production which will
be presented tonight and through
March 6. ,

"Ethan Frame” is a novel by
Edith Wharton and was adopted for
stage by Owen Davis and Donald
Davis. Though the book itself was
written in 1911, it was not presented
as a stage play until 1936.

Pettit is producing the play in the
manner of the epic theatre of Bert-
hold Brecht. The concept behind the
epic presentation is to place the
play in a larger historical frame-
work.

Stotemont of Life

"Ethan Frome” is an attempt to
make a statement about life in New
England. The cold atmosphere that
surrounds the characters that are
depicted in the play is to show how
the environment and life in New
England affect the family as agroup
and the life of one family in par-
tlcular.

The aim of the epic theatre is to
project the specific and unique to
a larger sphere; it is not a story of
one family.

The epic theatre uses projections
to try to show what the world is
like outside of the play’s scene.
Slides will be used in the beginning
of the play and throughout various
scenes.

The slides at the beginning will
be of the New England countryside.
[first the area will be shown as a
illCturesque rural landscape. Then
the scene will shift to lower social
strata and finally to the faces of the
People who make up the pupiace.

Tour at New England

The viewer will be taken on a
tour of New England that will begin
With the cuslomary vision of rural
life there and gradually shift to the
realistic and hard life that typifies
the Fromes’ area.

The Frome family here becomes
an example of New England instead

of being a unique unit. There is a
complex world outside of the hedge-
podge that is seen in the Frames.

Brecht calls this process “his-
torization." One point is turnedlnto
a view of the whole.

Slides are also being used to set
the stage. The original casthasbeen
cut from eleven to five as a result.
of the use of slides.

Suicide Scene

The suicide scene at the end of
the play is dramatized by the show-
ing of a rapid sequence of about fif-c
teen slides in ten seconds showing
a sled descending the hill and end-
ing in an unfocused crash.

In the epic theatre, there is a
definite attempt to make the aud-

ience aware that the theatre is an
artificial form.

The actors are seated on the
audience’s left and the Mill Caven-
dish trlo is on the right. Thus, the
play becomes a demonstration.

Two screens are utilized, a way
of borrowing from motion pictures.
The audience can be moved quickly
from one scene to another.

According to Pettit, “the pro-
duction of "Ethan Frome" givesme
an opportunity to use some of the
techniques that I observed in Europe
which I liked very much. I hope the
desired effect is a success.”

before, with the ratio of progress
increasing considerably each time.

"We now have over seventy play-
ers, a well-balanced instrumenta-
tion, and I am in the desirable
position of being able to audition
players fairly slectively.

“We plan to offer a Bachelor of
Arts and Bachelor of Fine Arts with
a major in music beginning in 1966,
and from that time on the nucleus
of the band and orchestra including
section leaders, will be made up
increasingly of music majors.

The band at present owns over
’15 instruments for use by students,
and is in the process of acquiring
a large number of new instruments
for the increased activity of the new
campus and the music major pro-
gram.

included will be unusual instru-
ments such as contra-bassoons,
contrabass Clarinets, and English
horns. Also included will be a num-
ber of stringed instruments, grand
pianos, and a harpslclmrd.

"It is also rewarding, however,
to prepare a really first-rate con-
cert with history and math and ed-
ucation majors, but the music
majors will of course make an
enormousdifference, to the group
as a whole and to the non-music
majors sitting next to them."

Obligations

“We have further obligations, I.
believe, as a University cultural
organization, and also as a serv-
ice group. This is why we march
in homecoming parades, send groups
to basketball games, and play con-
certs in local high schools.

“This latter activity will be in-
creasingly developed and expanded,
since it is well-known that touring
athletic and musical organizations
are among the most effective pub-
licity and recruiting devices that
schoiils have.

“i believe that as a University
we are beginning, finally, to get
over the awkward stage of growth
in which it has been more fashion-
able and "safe" to freely criticize
all school organizations while doing
nothing to help.

Portlclpatlon Needed

I think we all clearly recognize
that help and lmprovementls needed
in all areas, and the solution now is
more participation, with the accom-
panying spirit and stimulation that
would be felt in all areas of the
University.

“The band now has excellent mor-
ale, and the spirit of devotion‘of
its members is quite encouraging.

“i hope very much that Univer-
sity organizations can soon be in
such a promising stage of develop-
‘meni, and i think they can be, for
the solution now lies mainly in the
attitude of the students."
