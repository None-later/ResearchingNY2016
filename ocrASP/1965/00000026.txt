There is dinner music every night

choice of records and the actual
playing of them is the job of the
Student Food Committee. According
.to Mr. Corbiey, this group  "is
meeting regularly with me 'to open
lines oi communication between the
student body residing there to bring

about improvements for their mutual ‘

benefit.”

‘ Did the past fourteen days,

Our government has shown to the
world and , to some twenty-three
thousand servicemen in Vietnam
that it cares. In Presiddntdohn-
son's words, “We gone iar enough.
l've had enough of this.” .

Vietnam almost too clearly pars-
llels Korea in that it appears to be
a "war fought not to bewon." The
sting of Korea is still fresh in the
minds of many Americans.

Though the situation in Vietnam
is not as grave as that of fifteen
years ago, we cannot afford tovlew
it haphazardly. Prior to the re-
taliatory attacks, it certainly ap-
peared that we were taking things
lightly. .

it took the North Vietnamese fli-
teen months to provoke Mr. John-
son to, the point oi retaliations. A
P-T boat attack on U. S. destroyers,-
destruction of six 8-57 bombers at
Blenhoa Airport, the demolition of
Salgon's Brinks Hotel where U. S.
officers were quartered, and finally
a near-disastrous surprise attack
on Plelku airbase; all these except
the P-T attack went unanswered
until two weeks ago.

,About Time

A pamphlet in Detroit and Eng-
lish Annexes presents a series of
arguments proposing an end to the
war in Vietnam. According to the
pamphlet we are in Vietnam “to
prevent the spread oi Chinese Com-
munism." Former President Eisen- .
hower felt otherwise in 1954, “We
are pledged to maintain a strong
viable state capable of resisting
attempted subversion or aggression
by military means.’ ’

The pamphlet further urges us to
“declare an immediate cease-fire
and evacuate our troops, and call
a conference oi all the nations in-
volved in Vietnam, including Rus-
sia and Communist China.”

These proposals are ridiculously
absurd. if we should arrange a.
cease-fire, what guarantee have we
that the Cong would respect it? Dur-
ing the Korean war, the Chinese
Communists certainly “respected”
the cease-fire while the peace talks
were going on in Panmunlon.

if we ate going to remain in
Vietnam. — and that is fairly evi-
dent — we are going to have to show
the Cong that we are not easily
intimidated. The retaliatory raids
demonstrated just this.

No Appeasement with Force

To recall the words of General
MacArthur, “...if you practice ap-
peasement in the use of force, you
are doomed to disaster. I believe
that if you continue that way, you
are inviting the very thing you wish
to stop - the spread oi the conﬂict,"
would be appropriate for our new
policy.

Now that we are in this war to
say, it would be wise to follow
MacArthur’s credo —“lnwar,there
is no substitute for victory."

Start and Step

To aid motorists and hikers to
realize what it's all about, Prof.
Cowley plans to erect signs read-
ing “Art Start" and "Art Stop" at
the exhibit's extremities. in between
will be a kaleidoscopic collection
oi large plywood panels covered
with thrusting arrows, imperative
instructions in gibberish, baleful

orbs, luminescent loops,.and other

crazy contours.

"it might all look like pop art,”
says Prof. Cowley, “but it's really
variations on commercial and fine

’ art. Each panel is to reflect some

aspect of outdoor advertising. i
really don't know if my paintings
will be a spoof, or if outdoor ad-
vertising itself is a spoof."

Visual Tension

He emphasized that “Anything
not in harmony with nature tends
to create a visual tension. Artists
are people who should be noticed
because of their commitment to
art. Then, there are others, who
are only out to exploit. who really
affect the eye of the viewer."

He agreed that some advertising
and pop art smacks of"the lowest
possible level of taste or intellec-
ttual achievement. The pop artists
ask the question, ‘is this the kind
of world we want?’ "

Prof. Cowley is a Buffalo native
who has studied at Buffalo state.
Cornell University and Trinity Col-
lege in Dublin. He is a frequent
exhibitor. His serious canvasses
tend toward the realism of Ameri-
can Gothic bul are relieved by soft-
focus effects and gentle coloration.

Relentless Carlocoture

His current project, apparently
pursued more in sorrowful humor
than in anger, will relentlessly cari-
acature the American phenomenon
of outdoor advertising.

The artist is using “allthe colors
that artists don't use  fluorescent
colors favored by sign painters 
silver and gold, colors that sparkle.
It remains to be seen whether the
effect will be garish.

It also remains lobe seen whether
highway officials will take kindly to
roadside signs featuring emphatic
arrows and nonsense words. Pro-
fessor Cowley, a staunch landowner
as well as a militant al‘llst—wllh-a-
message, plans to cross that bridge
when he comes to it.

5 l by Larry“ Epstein  ~

a You can't keep a good book down.
This theoretical literary) law is,
unfortunately, often untrue. Happily,
one of a group of novels that has‘
,followed this law is “call u Sleep”
by Henry Roth.

The novel's history is curious
and exhilarating. “Call it Sleep"
was first published in 1934. Two

later the book vanished and the
publisher went out of business.

Most Neglected Books

By 1956 the novel was all but
forgotten. In that year the “Ameri-
can Scholar" magazine published
an article entitled “The Most Neg-
lected Books of the Past Twenty-
Flve Years.”ln this article “Call
it Sleep” was the only novel named
twice, by Alfred Kazin and Leslie
Fiedler.

Pageant Press reprintedthe novel
in 1960. But once again,despite some
critical acclaim (e.g. Dorothy Par-
ker), the novel was not publicly well

received.
H igh Proi so

in October 1964, Avon brought
out the book again, this time in

paperback. The “New York Times"

Sunday Book Review highly praised
the novel on page one, the first
time this influential space has been
devoted to a paperback.

Author Roth, who now tutors math-
ematics (be used to run a waterfowl
farm), is frankly scared of his suc-
cess. He is frightened that he will
"lose the identity it's taken..all this
time to rebuild. [f the sound oftrees

the novella convinced Albert is
not even his real father.

David’s mother, Genya, is warm.
tender, compassionate. She is
David's refuge from father,friends,
and the world.

Startingly Accurate

The book is poetic and startlngly
accurate. We see David in a variety
of very recognizable situations.

He relies upon his mother’s com-
forting voice to guide him past the
menacing ball and up the stairs.-

David, lost, is taken to a police
station by a grandmotheriy old wo-
man and is reunited with his mother.
Roth writes: "The screaming ofher
name was itself sheer, stark ec-
stasy, but all bliss was outplumbed
in the claspng of her neck."

“Call It Sleep" is very worth-
while readlng. A miracle may have
transformed a forgotten book into
what could become a classic.

Movies Carry Pop Art to Extreme;
Auteur Critic Reassess ‘Quickies’.

by Paul Jensen

The more serious exponents of
the current soup-can, pop-art fad
have, if nothing else, at least drawn
attention to the fact that art is not
necessarily limited to the Intell-
tloually “arty,” and that aesthetic
satisfaction may be found both in
objects designed soley for com-
merclal purposes and In elements
of popular culture hitherto cou-
slderetl beneath notice.

Of course, as ill most reactions
to the traditional, the idea has
been carried to lts illogical ex-
tremes. llut the basic germ, of
aesthetic pleasure provided by those
forms around us which had previous-
ly been taken for granted, still ex-
ists somewhere beneath it all.

Direct Connection

This concept, which began in
painting, has somewhat influenced
the related field of motion pictures.
A direct connection betwaeu the two
exists in the person ofAndy Warhol,
al'llst turned flluunaker. Dut War-
hol’s influence though newsworthy,
is cmmlarntively negligible.

Young Andrew‘s philosophy is a
glorification of mass taste and the
non-thought which usually dolor-
uunes it. lie liked "’l‘luy/illco."blp
did not understand it — not because
he was baffled but because ll would
have been a lot of Work and so he
didn't bolbol'.

Phlllsllno Foolishness
His favorite film last year was
"The Carpetbagger-s." that piece
of Phillsilue foolishness which,
though enjoyed by many, wasn't
even well-made foolishness.

No, Warhol's influence spreads
only within his own little under-
ground New York City universe.

There is, however, a much more
fur-reaching treml in film criti-
clsm which is parallel to, if not
connected with, the pop-art theory
ui recognizing the craftsmanship
and/or nl'tisiy of ulauyclearly com-
mercial objects/films.

Genres such ascrlmo films, Jerry
Lewis comedies and horror films

have gained in status abd or
sldot‘od more seriously. Sul'slythey

are not praised en masse, but it is
recognized that there are degrees
of quality in all types of films, and
that good film—making is not con-
fined to “serious” topics.

Highest Achievement
in fact, this reaction has even
gone so far as to speculate that
action films, such as westerns,
really are the highest achievement
in cinema as they emphasize mo-
tion, which is the key element in
film and the one which sets it apart

from other types of pictures.

lie this as it may, it is about
time that certain directors — such
as Don Siege! and Samuel Fuller —
who work in these bllberto unap-
preclated genres are finally get-
ting the praise and notice that they
deserve, Indeed, some rank quite
high in the estimation of certain

“auteur” critics.
New Molar Productions
This concern with previouslydls-
paraged genres has also resulted
in their being raised from B-quick-
lens to major productions.

Robert Mulligan's forthcoming
“The Marina Chronicles," Stanley
Kubrick's” Journey Beyond the
Stars, and Robert Aldricb's "Hush,
Hush. Sweet Charlotte” bring sci-
ence-fiction and thsterv inela-

Wbelber this rise will be advan-
tageous is uncertain -— it may be
that since more will be expected
from them than from the B pic-
tures, and they will more seriously
fall to meet the standards set for
them, they will be relegated back
to relative infamy. But speculation
is futile.
