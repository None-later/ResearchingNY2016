‘Frome’ Builds on Potentialities
To Achieve Stark, Cruel Reality

by Bruce Daniels'

"Ethan Frame,” now playing at
Richardson Studio Theatre through
Marcll 6, is a remarkable excur-
sion into the recent (lut psycllo-
logically ever-so-distant) past. Of
the three major productions this
year, it is by far the best.

With Peyton Place practially a

quaint and irrelevant as all antique

President Defends AWS
Curfew Hours Procedure

, To the Editoru 7

After reading last Tuesday's edi-
torial on the proposed hours change,
AWS and I felt ille need to fill in the
many inforlnation gaps. We did not
vote; but is there more to it than
that? Did you realize that the girls
who originally presented it werethe
ones to point out the major weak-
nesses? Did you try to find out why
we need more than just a flat state-
lnent like “Curfew hours for upper
class women all Friday and Satur-
day night will be 2 a.m.?”

Initially we lnust be able lojus-
tify any change to ourselves. We
need to interpret for present stu-
dents and educate future students.
Once we are convinced that our
reasoning is sound, logical, and
mature; than we are ready to sub-
mit our reasons in support of our
recommended change to the office

of the Dean of Women.

If a proposal is weak in any part,
it is generally in the reasons rather
than in the wording of the proposal

' itself. Such'was the case with the
hours change proposal. Did you ask
yourself why you favor an hours
change? If you Ilave reasons, you
neglected to mention them in the
editorial.

Did you ask whether having 2:00
hours is the best possible solution?
Our discussion Tuesday resulted ill
the suggestion of two alternate pro-
posals which will be presented along
with the original proposal at the
next meeting. Final voting will then
be after a lapse of a week allowing
time for AWS representatives to
get the general concensus of the
girls for whom tlley vote. Are we
alter a cllange for the sake of
change or are we after the best of
several alternatives?

l tlllllk the members of AWS
would be among the first to grant
that progress is slow. but the im-

All communicallons mull be addressed to the Editorv and should be signed,

words and on will-ct to editing. The Albany Stu Dnl'f’reu assume: no respon-
IIbIIIly Ior opinion: expressed In its columns or communIcalIone, as such u-

pllcatiolls of the changes we rec-
ommend are far reaching. They
affect not only the way we live now
but also will affect and influence
.tlle way future women of this uni:
versity will live. Such changes
should be broad enough to eliminate
repeated modifications. Tlley should
foster the assumption of individual
responsibility as well as meeting
present needs and desires.

For lne llle greatest suns of
progress thus far this thl have
not been ill the number of pro-
posals passed but rather (I) in the
increased interest women have
shown Ill taking part III the formu-
lation of their rules, (2) ill accept-
ing the responsibilities which ac-
company additional privileges, and
(3) in the increased awareness that
the above is possible and is a nlore
productive alternative than unchan-
neled criticism.

This may not satisfy those look-
ing for quantitative results; how-
ever, this basic change in attitude
will serve as a foundation for future
progress. I feel that this is the
most effective and constructive way
in which to proceed.

dailies promised — a tale of "fiery
passions in a chilly climate ” we
will surely be disappointed at this
raging tempest in an antiquated
teapot.

Half-Realized Adultery

The adultery of Ethan Frame and
Mattie Siver — such as it Is -
consists of half-realized, dilnly ar-
ticulated thoughts and culminates in
a single, agonizedand hopeless kiss.
it doesn't seem a very sophisticated
idea to build a play all, at all.

But “Ethan Frome” (adapted
from Edith Wharton's novel by Owen
and Donald Dav s) is something
quite different from conventional
soap-opera melodrama. It is, in
Eric Bentley’s phrase,“soap-opera
plus" - that is, it builds on the
melodramatic potentialities of the
well-worn "triangle" and becomes
a distressingly clear and cruel vis-
ion of realty.

The piay’s three acts tells of
Ethan's growing love for his wife’s
cousin Mattie and of the threat of
separation whicn drives them to
the point of suicide; a prologue alld
an epilogue, taking place twenty
years after the central action.drive
home ille futility and despair fol-
low llg Ethan’s and Mattie's naive
attempt to escape their condition.

Wife Represonts Reality

j Zeuobla l-‘rome is not solllucllihe
jealous wife as the malevolent
“reality—pl‘inclple" of the play —
an incarnation of Necessity. The
only break ill her relentless aus—
terity comes, churaclerisl ('ully
enough when she finds that afavor-
ite dish has been shattered and
(also characteristically) hidden by
Ethan. It is not so much jealousy
that moves her, as the fear'of dis-
order.

Mary Temple is magnificent as
Zenobia on or off tllc stage, her
eerie, icy presence is so strongly
felt that the slide-pro eclion of an
“all-seeing eye" (appearing when
Ethan and Mattie are alone to—
gelller) is allogether superfluous.

The heavy lnsistence on the broken

  

pickle-dish (ill another slide)is also
unnecessary in the light of Miss
Temple’s fine performance.

Alex Krakower as Ethan and Nor-
ma Gitter as Mattie gave less than
satisfactory performances. Krako—
wer’s voice and bearing weren‘t up
to the difficult demands of Ills role.
and Miss Gitter played Matlle \vuh
too much tilnldlty and not enough
spontaneity.

Jotl'lom a Perceptlve Site

Charles Heinelnall did 3 mar—
velously funny and perceptive Joy
in the smaller role ufJolhanl. illlll
John Fotla played Denis Eady \i'illl
competence.

Director Paul Petlit’s use of
“epic” materials (slide-prowl:-
tions live stage music. tape-rc-
corded voices) is a thoroughly 1m»
aginative and intelligent adlhuon of
an otherwise straightforward "un-
turalistic” psychological dranm.
With the exception of those already
mentioned (and a few dlsll'llvllngl:
familiar pllotos), the slides are sc-
lected and arranged exil'ellleh ucll

Tonight the IFG will present the
latest .in the series of outstanding
silent films when ltshowsthe"Pas-
sioll of Joan of Arc” at 7:30 p.m. in
D349.

After the showing, Dr. Theodore
Adams of the English department
will speak. ‘

Directed by Carl Thodore Dreyer,
this film from 1928 is one of the
last of the experimental silents.
Dreyer was a Danish mystic who
used cinematic effects and symbols
to clothe his idiosyncratic philo-
soplly.

ln ills “Valnpyr” (shown by the
lFG last year), for example,he used
the vampire-werewolf theme for
horror, but also garbed the idea
with such a multitude of strangely
beautiful symbols that the plot be-
came hard to follow.

“The. Passion of Joan of Arc"
is a film that does not exhibit many
of the tortuous complex ties of
“Vampyr,” yet deals with a so! -
feet that is close to Dreyer’smysti-
cal sense.

Dreyer takes the Joan story from
the time of the trial, and follows it
up until the time ofJoan’s anguished
death.

Dreyer had previously worked
only in Denmark and Germany, but
for “Passion " Ile went to France
ill order to capture, as he lloped,
the true spirit of the drama. The

Proficlt'oS‘peall After Movie ‘

crew was entirely French, as were
the actors.

“Static poetic, and intensely
moving." says film historian Iris
Barry about Dreyel"s imaginative
use of gigantic closeups that mir-
row every reaction of the actors.
Tile titles are in English, and the
filln, as are all of the services, is
free of charge.
