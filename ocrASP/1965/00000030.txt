. Professor Discusses
Business Systems

Dr. Donald Mulkerne, Professor
of Business at State, was the guest
speaker at the Phi Beta Lambda
meeting on Thursday, February 25.
Dr. Mulkerne spoke on “Office Sys-
tems and Office Administration."

in his speech, Dr. Mullgerne said
that the “greatest waste is aper-
son who does his duties without any
particular scheme."

Dr. Mulkerne recommended a
system in order to prevent this.

He warned that for a system to
be effective it must be dynamic in
every department of a company.
He commented that "the chief fault
of systems is stalling."

Dr. Mulkerne accounted for this
with the human element involved,

Stanford’s Dean of Wamen Accuses

English Professors of Coed Seducing

The social life on the campus of
Stanford University was at a low
recently due to on article appear-
ing in the student newspaper in
-which the Dean of Women, Lucille
Allen, called the English Profes-
sors ,“a pack of wolves who try

S.ll.li.l.i. Students
Discuss us. Policy
flier Siena Radio

On Thursday, February 25,Bruce
Form represented the "ASP" and
radio station WSUA at a group dis-
cussion of the United States Govern-
ment policy in Vietnam. Students
from both Albany State and Siena
College took'part in the discussion,
which was a follow-up to the pro-
test and counter-protest marches
by State and Siena students on State
Street recently.

Philip Lord of State presented his
views opposing the government
policy and explained the point of the
protest march down State Street.

William Figiozzi and Jon Rubach
of Siena then presented their views
advocating the government policy
and explained their counter-march
down State Street.

After this general presentation of
views and ideas, the different fac-
tions were questioned by Bruce
Ferm and lrving Stephens of the
"Siena News." In general, this dis-
cussion amounted to a presentation
of pro and con views on the govern-
ment policy with neither side mak-
ing a truly convincing presentation

to corrupt University co-eds.”

Allen characterized the profs in
the article as real life counter-
pah'ts of "Candy’s" Professor Me-
phisto. She charged them with“sex-
ually arousing the freshman both
within the classroom and without."

She cited as an example a pro-
fessor who stood on the steps of
one of the University's buildings
and urged the freshman to "make"
a girl within the week.

The newspaper asserted that the
Dean knew of several cases in
which professors had seduced stu-
dents. She said that one of the girls
involved” was now "no better than
a streetwalker."

Profs Having Grading Power

The article attributed to the Dean
this comment: "professors exer-
cise control over the girls by vir-
tue of their grading power; and they
intimidate a girl who will not com-
ply with their wishes." -

The story also accredited to Allen
the remarks that the course content
included “salacious materials which
freshman study in their courses.
The young professors arouse the
girls sexually.

“They concentrate deliberately
on the erotic aspects of literature,
in part because those who are un-
married use literature as their
sexual outlet, and in part to seduce
the girls in their classes."

Student Reaction Mixed
The student reaction Oil campus
was mixed, with some laughingover
the whole matter, others launching

bitter sarcasm at the Dean.
Jon ftoise, an editor of the“Stan-
ford Daily," called the English De-
partment a group of “very vibrant

“student-faculty relationship."
He added that the controversy

arose not because of whatever ex- ‘-

tracurricular activities may or may
not have occurred, but because the
Dean had attempted to control course
material.

The "San Francisco Chronicle"
interviewed several students on
campus to receive their viewpoint
on the issue. One sophomore said
that "the teacher emphasizes the
sexual aspect,. but many of them
teach with the Freudian point of
view."

Freshman Calls Manor "Silly"

A freshman girl called the mat‘
ter "silly." She commented that
“its just ballooning because its
racy. People ask me if my teacher
is like this - i don’t think so. She
is a lady."

Some English professors at-
tempted to make a farce over the
matter in their classroom, being
purposely gross.

The Dean replied to the article
disavowing all the statements, spe-
cifically those concerning the Eng-
listl Department.

Miss Bock stated that the committee feels that there
is a need to change the mascot and nickname because
"Pads" and "Podguin" do not apply to our changing
University and that the best way to find appropriate
new ones is to encourage suggestions from members
of the University community."

The committee was formed in December as the
result of a decision of the Athletic Advisory Board to
investigate changes in school tradition in athletics.
lt was originally, composed of members of senate and
the AA Board, but was altered to include members
from other organizations on campus.

Their first task was to research the history of the
Albany area and the University to find any possible
ideas for a new nickname or mascot. But because
their efforts did not prove fruitful, they decided to
bring the problem to the student hodv
