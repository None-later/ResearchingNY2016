Who do you think will get

lgo tinge. llo Solution

A topic much in the news this pastweek
has been the pressure on the New York
State Legislature to increase the legal
drinking age from the present 18 to 21
years. Governor Rockefeller has indi-
cated that he would sign such a measure

, if enacted by both Houses, but at the

same time commented “that such a law
would not' solve the serious problems
that concern all of us." ”

“But because so many people feel so
strongly and it is bound to have bene-
ficial effects — although I think some
people overestimate some of them —
I will sign it." '

We for once agree with the good Gov-
ernor. Changing the legal age would not
solve the “problem.”

To begin with, the aura surrounding
all alcoholic beverages createsanatural
attractiveness for their indulgence. To
raise the drinking age would only in—
crease further the allure of“the drink.”

To this would be added the further
appeal of defying authority. and. at the
same time, gaining membership to the
“in group."

From our point of view, the 18 year-
old is fully capable of wise conduct in
regard to alcohol. The lack of maturity
on the part of some individuals should
not color the case of the vast major-
ity. who do not become the “problems.”

One of the greatest reasons for the
move in New York State to increase the
legal age has been the pressure by
neighboring states, whose teenagers con—
tinually cross the border to obtain liquor.
These minors serve to spotlight a situa-
tion which is characteristically con-
cerned with the few rather than the many.

 

the other ll seats on MYSKANIA?

We do not feel that New York State
should be pressured into accepting such
an unreal “solution.”

Judging from the situation on this
campus. we can find no justification
for such a measure. Too much of a
college population that is now able to
adequately handle alcohol would be un-
fairly and. adversely afkcted by the pro-
posed age change.

We strongly recommend that NewYork
find ways of dealing with individual cases,
rather than penalizing the entire group.

.illo Big Pill Problem

The big PDA problem is againupon us.
By this we mean, of course, that roguish.
illicit pastime, Public Display of Affec-
tion. Long the bane of existence in the
lives of housemothers, resident assis-
tants, and deans, this scurrilous activity
has been repressed, but can never be
fully stamped out. v

The hot passions of youth will not be
smothered by the plethora of restric-
tions imposed by the cold unfeeling auth-
orities.

Even in the face of bright lights, large
signs, and glaring housemothers, true
love will always find “the way."

We believe that the blatant defiance of
authority exhibited in the. Lower Lounge
since the sign made its appearance can
only lead to a complete moral degenera-
tion.

We shudder to think of the image our
illustrious institution may acquire should
a visitor chance to wander into the
Lounge and see State students passion-
ately involved in holding hands.

We call upon every responsible mem-
ber of this university communitytomeet
and overcome this grave problem.

«Mon. l. batsman

- words” said Pete Seeger,
.when he was asked if- he
‘found that music crosses

language barriers; Seeger
was interviewed after his
concert here last weekby
several students. .
He gave his answers and opinions
on the numerous questions that were
posed by Gerry Terdiman who rep-
resented radlostation WFLY (92.3
on the FM dial) where he hosts

‘ "The World of Folk Music" from

4-5 p.m. on Saturdays, Tim Atwell,
and this writer.

Life "Machine Run"

One of the songs that Seeger sang
told that for “everything there is a
time," He ‘iater commented that
“so much of our life is now ma-
chine run — almost everything will
be done by mechanical devices. All
we have to do is pay.”

However, ‘fa healthy musical state
allows people to make their own
‘music, though you need professional
experts also."

Last year Seeger traveled around
the world and had an opportunity to
observe various cultures. He sang
of these varied cultures and said
“Viva la difference." In the world‘s
veritable melting pot of cultures,
he said “we are all cousins, but
everyone will always be somewhat
different. Thank the Lord for these
differences."

Controversy and College

During the concert he said, “If
I have said anything controversial
tonight, I hope it is." This seemed
to express part of his attitude to
stir people to think and emerge
from the complacency that is all
too prevalent in modern society.

‘it’s easier to keep our mouths
shut ... and mind our own business,”
sang Seeger.

   

e fro}

m... asked

 

what he thought or

~the'_‘:riots at'Berkeley and of the

.i'reeuspeech- movement. To this, he
responded that he probably knew
about as much as we did, but said
"in the last five years, more Search;
ing questions have been asked ofme
by college students."

"College is a place for contro-
versy. 'You can't have education
without 'it and the experience or
asking questions. “

Seeger “sang out the love” as
be emotionally sang "If I Had 'a
Hammer,” a song that he wrote
about-fifteen years ago. He pre.
raced his remarks on this song
by quoting Lincoln on freedom. “I!
I go to a wolf and say don’t eat my
sheep, I have inhibited the wolf’s
_freedom."

“Love, all love, oh careless love,
see what love has done to me," was
the .refrain of one oi his encores.

Many-Sided Truths
lie-spoke of the results that can
arise when labors of love are ap.
plied carelessly or unwiser ~ lhe
broken hearts and the “horror that
Einstein wouldexpcrlence if he could
see the bombs that have been made

as a result ofhis formula ofEequuls

me2 which was a labor of lova.“
“Moral truth is many-sided —
don't lump to conclusions. "

Then there were the questions
about folk music, trends, and im—
pressions. Seeger defined folk music
as that which is created by a pm-
cess where people are unconsciously
changing old songs.

He was asked how the rise 0!
commercialism has affected folk
music. To this he replied that, “i
am commercial — I make my living
singing. However, there is always
a tendency to lose sight of singing
for pleasure.”

Seeger cautioned not to fill k or
the current folk music revival as
something that is either on the hit

PETE SEEGER GIVES his opinions on a variety of topics in an
interview with State students following his concert last Friday.

parade or not. He said that noone
person is responsible for the cur-
rent folk song revival but the "Weav-
are (which he helped organize) and
the Kingston Trio have helped."
Folk Music and Identification
One of the things he was asked
was if the folk craze is a reflection
of an attempt to identify with the
country.'..now that young song wri-
ters like Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs
are writing so much protest music

which doesn’t go back to the grass

English Prof Congratulates
ASP's Reaching ’Big Time'
To the Editors: "

For some time now (ever since

the State College News became the
Albany Student Press)! have watched

'the development of your paper with

much interest. The new format, the
twice-weekly appearance, and the
greatly extended coverage indicate
the transition to a genuinely univer-
sity type of publication. As an un-
dergraduate at the University of
Chicago, I worked two and a half
years on the staff of "The Daily
Maroon," a paper which (at that
time, at least) had much in common
with the “ASP.” It, too, was not the
product of a School of Journalism,
and was solely in the hands of the
students, without faculty supervision
or control. This, i believe, is the
best type of supervision for a stu-
dent newspaper; it leads, some-
times, to embarrassments of one
type or the other, but in the long
run, it produces a better paper with
lovelier articles and the kind of
controversy which leads to thought-
ful analysis of complex issues. As
John Milton said, "Where there is
much desire to learn, there will of
necessity be much arguing, much
writing, many opinions; for opinion
in the good men is but knowledge
’in the making."

A case in point is the letter from
Music Council which appeared in the
“ASP” for February 20.Theediiors
deserve credit for printingthelelter
in full, even the opening sentence:

“Your editorial of February 10
shows the lack of research and back-
ground that generally appearson the
editorial page each week."

i happen to believe Music Council
was right on the Polo Sanger issue,
but i also feel that the editors of
"ASP" deserve commendation for
accepting such blunt criticism so
gracefully.

Your coverage of the arts is per-
ilcuiariy praiseworihy. The feature
articles, with photographs, of the

University Concert sand, the forth-
coming production of “Ethan
Frame," and' Professor Cowley’s
pop art exhibit; and the revxew or
“Call It Sleep” — all are fullyi'nm-
parable to the kind of thing we Used
to do in “The Daily Maroon.”

Another thing i have noticed is
the fact that your reporters seek
out interesting and timely subjects
to write about; viz., the new School
of Social Welfare and the food serv-
ice at the new campus.

This seems to be a fun lellel. I
suppose what I am really doing is
congratulating you on having mme
into the big time. Enough brickhuis
are buried at you; you desem- u
bouquet once in a while. Althoughl

do not agree with every article nl‘
every editorial you publish (who
does?) I am nevertheless proud in
be a member of a faculty whmc
students are capable of puilirg out
such a newspaper as this (llol'uff
to the contrary notwithstanding).

Dean Hartley Clarifies

ASP Editorial on ‘Banner'

To the Editorll

This letter is in response in 'hi-
recent editorial in the "ASP" w-
Eﬁl'dlng “Tile Dunner." 'l‘hl-ro .nr
several facts which hood in l'l‘
clarified.

l. The editorial slums: “llwni'

2. The editorial sluice:

tees, with the outcome ihni the
committee decided that ii would .il-
law these men to continue pnhlh-n-
tion." The Student Personnel (.‘Ulnl-

run“.

cil met, wrih President Art Johns-
ton and Chairman Baumann (of MYS-
KANIA), to discuss what constituted
an organization. It did-not decide to
“allow” these men to continue pub-
lication since this is clearly stated
as a function of Senate.

a. The editorial states: “An or-
ganization's constitution does no
more than merely file the group’s
name." It is clear that groups
seeking recognition from Senate in
the past have proposed a name for
their organization but have also
stated their objectives and defined.
how they intend to operate.

This University has long and ar-
dently asserted the right of any in-
dividual to circulate statements or
petitions with which he is willing to
be identified. It has also taken the
position that groups wishing to or-
ganize on campus and use the fa-
cilit.es will be recognized by Sen-
ate.

The rationale behind these posi-
tions is one of intellectual honesty

which says that the community he—
lieves in free and open expression

but that it also believes iliat persons‘
or groups will support what they say.

In this particular case,"l3anner"
carries a mast-head, a volumenum-
her and the designationofbotheditor
and publisher. if ulsoinvltes contri-
butions. But its editors maintainihai
ilhey were speaking as individuals.
.The major question then is what
constitutes an organization?

The constitution of Student Asso-
ciation lists the duties and powors
of tile Senate which shall be "To
charter and/or recognize budgetary

and non-budgetary organizations of-

iho Student Association.” it Would
seem to me that this wash matter
for decision by the Senate aniles-

KANlA (or their successors). Ulll-‘

"lately, they must decide, as the
duly elebted representatives of Stu-
dent Association, whether they will
“Tilt out their duties and powers
or no.

Also, does the urban folk singer
have a responsibility to sing about
urban conditions rather than tra-
ditional songs?

To this, Seeger said that the cur-
rent craze is an attempt to identify
with the country, but “every per-
son in the world has the duty to do
his best. Thank the Lord for dif-
ferences of opinions. People who
want to make music now may be
inspired by the old, but make new
music also."

“Each year there are different
singers and styles. People will real-
ize that they don’t have to like
them all.”

Collecting Process ’

The process of gathering and col-
lecting material for folk songs is a
» long procedure. Seeger said that he
does not collect folk music as such.

-"I learn from the people who do
collect such material. I often feel
like the seven blind men who were
asked to describe an elephant when
I ask about songs.

“I have been led astray by wrong
information on songs i like." He
said that no one person has in-
fluenced liim the most. He has de—
veloped his style after listening to
many singers and borrowing from
many writers.

Seeger replied to the question,
to what do you attribute your popu-
larity, by saving: “Ishoui and boiler
and get my audience to sing withme
(as was often done during his per-
formance at State) so they don’t
listen to me and drown me out.”

“And i like to hear them (the
audience) sing."

diction over several smaller com-
munities so that all legislation was
“all-inclusive.” There was a note
of sadness in his voice as he 'told
his-story. : ~ -
Mayor Stonehenge, ruler of the
entire community complex, had often
said that'he wished every citizen to
have the opportunity to reside in
the commlmiiy;‘and that no person
should be. denied the opportunity

for want of personal finances.

Proposals Acclaimed

His proposals were greeted with
loud acclaim. Great taxes might
.have inhibited the ability of the
citizens to remain in the commun-
ity. The fact that an honorable man
had promised a residency free of
taxes could only be the most won-

erful news. '

The citizens, happily partaking of
the bountlous benefits of the com-
munity, lived in tranquility for many
years.

Then, one day , catastrophe struck.
A utilities tax of outlandish propor-
tlons was imposed upon the com-
munity. Realizing the obvious burden
to current residents and especially
to prospective citizens, the populace
decried the ignominlous action.

They picketed City Hall; they
wrote angry letters to protest to
the municipal newspaper. But their
efforts were in vain. The tax re-
mained.

Vietnam Offers United States One Choice:
Protection of Freely Elected Government

by Evan Hadley

A week ago last Saturday,twenty-
five people out of a Capital District
population of over 400,000 marched
up State Street to protest the pres-
ence of U. S. troops in South Viet-
nam.

Obviously, people despite con-
gressional controversy over our
policy in Southeast Asia, are (10-
cally at least) either favorable or
apathetic to continuing the limited
war.

But how meaningful or knowl-
edgeable is this support? In the
light of recent developments, not
very.

Lippman
in 1955 Walter Lippman wrote:

“The rule, to which there are few
exceptions, is that at critical junc-
iurcs. the prevailing mass opinion
will impose what amounts to a veto
upon changing the course on which
the government is at that time pro-
ceedlng.”

stances, the public zenerally sup-

ports the status quo as long as it
isn’t extremely undesirable.

if Congress decides to ride the
crest of "public opinion” or (worse)
intensifies it by demagoguei'y, we
will smoothly slnk deeper into the
morass until something snaps.

Encouragingly, legislators, by and
large, haven’t done this, but neither
have they made any positive pro-
posals.

The dilemma, as viewed by Con-
gress, appears to be this: if we
stay in Vietnam, we may lose; if
we flee, we lose by default. While
this thinking is obviously correct,
the corollaries added to it by Con-
gress are not. For example:

A Victory Bad Propaganda

(1) "if we do win, we will stem
the tide of Communist aggression
in Asia." No. A victory iii Vietnam
would create bad propaganda for us
all over the world; we could easily
get involved in a dozen dirty wars,"
partially lroughi by our bad public
image, not only in Asia butperhaps,
even in Latin America.

And each one would be harder to
win than the last. Furthermore, our
victory wouldn't even bring stable
government to Vietnam - latent
hostility would remain and with the
existing army domination, an end-
less succession of Nguyen Klianlls
would shape.

The system of petty dictatorship
has always been unstable and would
merely pave the way for another
revolution.

(2) "A negotiated solution would
either bring a 'piuk’ government or
on unstable neutral one." By now,
it's practically a reflex for ad-
herents to this nilsoonception to
scream, "Look iii Lacs! whenever
anybody suggests neutralization.

Loos Not Noutrol
What those menial quick-draw
artists fall to realize however is
that Laos is not a neutral govern-
ment, it's a three faction govern-
ment with each factor having po-
litical or quasi-political power.

Obviously, such arreglmo is bound
to get into trouble. A really neutral
government would reflectacompro-

mise, not a household feud. Even a
government like Cambodia's which
is forced to vacillate between East
and West would be relatively pref-
arable.

(Sihanouk’s reginie is the only
stable non-Communist government
in lndo-China — a fact that the
U. S. seems unwilling to realize.

(I!) "A free election would bring,

the Viet Cong to power and thus
turn the country over to the Com-
munists." One of these days, the
American press is going to make
known the fact that the people we
are fighting aren't all Communist
or Communist dominated.

N. L. F. i/3 Communist
Tile most reliable sources indi-
cate that about a third of the Na-
tional Liberation Front (what we
call the Viei Cong) is Communist,
and it’s know that the head of the
front is not Communist.

And the people in Vietnam sym-
pathize with the N. L. F., not with
the Communists. If free elections
were held in Vietnam a moderately
leftist, lut democratic government
would result.

Of 'rourse the Communists would
try to stage a coup, but this time
they Wouldn't have popular support.
and a peace force (U.N., U.S. or"
other) would have a much easier
time maintaining order.

But without some such stabilizing
force, a coup is not probable, and this
is what makes Senator Morse's
catchy “pull out and let them settle
ii" proposal (as if a slug fest were
any rational solution to a political
problem) is ridiculous.

This, then, is our choice. Either
we defend the petty dictatorship and
fight against improbable odds, or
pull out and encourage an eventual
takeover by the Communists.

if we want the world to believe
that we are sincere in our defense
of democracy, neither of "rose si-
ternatives is feasible.

Only one practical and moral
thing remains — to allow free elec-
tions and make sure that the re-
sulting government is protected.
The real ideals of America and the
world demand that we do this.
