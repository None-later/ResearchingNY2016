clﬂc field in which he will study.
for the rest of his school career.

Oxford University , the alma mater
of Mr. Heal, and its 'sister’ Cam-
bridge operate on a system which
differs from that of other Univer-
sities. In addition to open lectures,
special tutors assign to each student
a weekly topic to be prepared from
independent readings, lectures and
research.

These papers, and all University
work, are concentrated only on one
major area of study.

Oxford, with a 6-1 predominance
of men is virtually free to those
students of ability thanks to national
scholarships based on need and
scholastic achievement.

However, the Oxford system, Heal
reluctantly admits, though admired
by Americans has met with some
"dissatisfaction" in England and a
new more liberal system is ap-
pearlng.

But if the State student has less
academic freedom than his British
counterpart, he has more social
freedom.

Heal smilineg recalls the re-
strictions which required students
to register all cars with city and
University police and assure auth-
orities that the vehicle was properly
equipped with a tell-tale green light
which was easily identifiable in local
traffic.

Although regulations concerning
guests of the opposite sex were
liberal by State standards (women
were allowed in men’s apartments
until 7:30 p.m. when they had to be
registered in a special roll-book),
male students as well as female
students faced curfews.

The Wall-Climbers

Occasionally. laughs Heal, a stu-
dent wouldn't quite make the curfew
and was forced to climb the wall
surrounding the campus in order to
get back to his apartment.

On one occasion when the Univer-
sity was expanding, the administra-
tion closed up a broken area of the
wall that had been used to “sneak”

home. Fearing the mass scandal of
stranded Romeos and reconciled
to the wall-climbing tradition of
Oxford, the administration oblig-
ingly broke down another portion
of the wall.

In addition to these difficulties,
Oxford students were confined to a
3 mile radius outside the school.
If the rule were enforced here,
Heal chuckles, New Campus men
would be barred from Yezzi’s.-

The first reaction that the visit-
ing Geographer had of the United
States was that it was “big.” Al-
though Englishmen know the coun-
try is large, they seldom realize
its full dimensions.

Since in England all parts of the
island are within ’70 m les of the
sea, and since Albany on the map
appears to be almost a coastal city,
the Heals innocently set off on a
weekend jaunt to New England to
see the'Atlantic.

With amazement Heal records
that his seaside excursion covered
:00 ml es of American coastal reg-
on.

The Land of Plenty

His second greatest surprise was
in seeing a poor white American for
the first time.

"One knows, of course, that not
all Americans are wealthy,” he ex-
plains; "and not all cities are like
Manhattan, but one just doesn't ex-
pect to see poverty or the slum
areas in an ordinary American
city.“

When asked how the Americanshe
has met have reacted to his “Brit-
ish-ness," Professor Heal smiling-
ly notes an absence of overt hos-
tility. but admits his surprise at
having been immediately placed on

a first-name basis with State fac-
ulty.

The initial experiment inspired a r
fruitful collaboration which led to .
the transition from flag to banner.
The original cartoon for the ban-
ner rendered by the artist can be

terial, color, and size are selected, -
the banners are executed by a ,

editions and are signed and num-
bered by the artist.

Heraldry oi 'Banners

Banners suggest heraldry or per-
haps tapestry or hand-woven hang-
ings; however, they are more re-
lated to collage as created by the
abstract-expressionist or the pop
artist. The machine-made multi-
plicity of the banner relates it also
to the graphic medium especially
as a solution to the contemporary
need for large-scale multiple works
of art which sell at a modest price.

feels, more casual than " _,“
and he finds the lnformallty- of
American collegiates indicative
more off American attitude than
youthful disrespect to faculty.

0n the subjects of State, Mr.
Heal's reactions throw some new
light on old problems.

The Old, Sad Rolrain

Regarding the current complaint
of “apathy in Albany," Heal recalls
that the theme was equally popular
at Oxford, although that University’s
age and close-knit campus offer
greater cultural opportunities.

Noticeably absent, however, Heal
notes was any real political activity
during the last American election.
Having observed his first American
presidential election last fall, Heal’s
greatest interest was in the bitter
debate over State’s rights. Coming
from a nation too small to make
divisions feasible, he was astonished
to hear that in the American system,
States had rights.

As an Englishman in America at
the time of Churchill’s death, Heal
expressed surprise and gratification
at the extent of American reaction,
particularly as evidenced by the
interest of major television net-
works.

After three semesters at State,
Professor Heal and his family are
uncertain of their future plans.
Loomingahea'd, however, is the ex-
citing prospect of seeing the rest
of “God’s own country."

. ,- LEE LlSS.....to direct Revue again.

At a recent meeting of the Revue Committee, the
plans for this year’s State University Revue, “Damn
Yankees,” were formalized. This year’s Revue will be
presented on May 21 and 22 in Page Hall. The Revue
is completely financed and operated by students with
the assistance of Student Association. ,

Auditions for the Revue will be held on March 30
and 31 and April 1 in Page Hall. Persons who have
previously auditioned are urged to attend the tryouts
again, and they will be contacted by letter in the near
future. ~

As in the past two years, the Revue will be directed
by Lee Lisa, ’65. Miss Lisa is remembered for her past
productions of “Annie Get Your Gun" and “Once Upon
A Mattress.” Both productions were excellently re-
ceived.

“With the rapidly expanding student population, we
know that this year’s Revue will be the finest ever,"
said Miss Liss recently. “Not only have more people

expressed interest in working on the Revue, but we
also have a potentially larger audience.”

Although some members of the Revue Committee have
been selected, there are still manypositionstobe filled
on the staff and crew. Persons interested in any phase
of the Revue should contact Miss Liss at 482—4244.

W
Tripartite Censorship Retard: learning;
Churches, Groups, Government Involved

by Larry Epstein

One distinguishing characteristic
of some of the members of our cul-
ture is that they wish to have the
power to determine just what read-
ing materials should be available
not just for themselves, but for the
other members of the society as
well. There are, of course, psycho-
logical motivations prompting the
censors, but this problem will be
attacked from a moral standpoint.

Our country was founded, and is
supposed to operate, on the basis
of individualism. Translated into
literary terms, this means that it
-is up to the individual to select
what he chooses to read.

Antithesls to Learning
Censorship is an antithesis to

   
 
  

   

     
 
  

 
 

   

  
 

   

  
 

the advancement of learning. To
borrow one of Milton’s ideas, cen-
sorship implies that a people need
no more truths (for truths may
be included in the censored ma-
terial).

There is also the problem of
rampant censorship. By this I mean
who will be the one responsible for
deciding where censorship stops
once it has gotten started? Par-
ticular books are worthwhile for
some people, worthless for others
and probably detrimental to some.
Do we then determine by probable
percentages which books should be
banned?

The popular sport of book-banning
as played by Mrs. Grundy and her
cohorts is carried on by people who
can he sub-divided intothree groups:

Kramer to lecture
lln Expressionism

Hilton Kramer, managingeditor of
“Arts Magazine" will speak at 8:30
p.m. in Brubacher Lower Lounge
on Thursday. March 11. His topic
will be “The Expressionist Tra-
dition in German and AustrianArt."

Mr. Kramer is a graduate ofSyr-
ar-use University. He has done addi-
tional work at Columbia University,
the New School for Social Research,
and Harvard University. His major
field of interest is European cul-
ture.

Kramer has written for many pull-
licalions, including "Partisan Ite—
view," "The New Republic," and
“Commentary.”

The lecture is being sponsored by
the Art Council. The Council was
formed last year in an attempt to
more specifically serve the art
interests of students and faculty.

Since that time Art Council has
sponsored many speakers and fur--
nlshed the formerly almost vacant
Draper Gallery with many exhibi-
lions.

announces Wallop

Month “selection, ' _‘"l‘he Year the
Yankees 'Lost‘thellennant," tells the ’
story ofapluinp and holding. middle-~
aged real-estate salesman in Wash-

ington, D. C. who is an avid fan of .

the Washington Senators.

In a rash moment he murmurs that
he'd "sell his soul to see the Wash- ‘
ington Senators win the pennant from

the damn Yankees."

Thd Devil

At this moment the Devil appears,
in the guise of a personable gentle-
man called Mr. Applegate, who of-
fers to make a pact with him: in re-
turn for his soul he will transform
him into a young and unbeatable
ballplayer.

The real estate agent agrees but
insists on an "escape clause”
whereby at a certain date he will be
restored to his former self to re-
join his wife and live out his years
normally. The Devil agrees.

The phenomenal young player, now
known as Joe Hardy, joins the Sena-
tors, and the team moves right up
to second place in the American
League.

But Applegate has other plans.
He is secretly on the side of the
Yankees and is plotting to whet
the hopes of the Senators and then
to wrest the victory away from
them at the final hour.

When young Hardy learns this,
he asks to exercise his option and
to be returned to his former status
at the side of his faithful wife.

Luscious Lola

But Applegate employs the serv-
ices of Lola, a ravishingly beauti-
ful witch, to tempt him into stay-
ing on the side of the Devil. How-
ever, Hardy remains true to the
wife left behind him.

Lola breaks her precedent by
falling in love with her victim and
aids him in defeating the Devil.
For her trouble she is converted
again into an ugly old crone. The
Washington ball club emerges vic-
torious, and the real estate agent
is restored to his wife.

church—affiliated censorship, non-
church-affiliated group censorship
and governmental (on all levels)
censorship.

Moral Restraint

As a church-going, religious per-
son, a reader has some choice. He
can follow the dictates of his church
or he can select his literary fare
as he chooses. In either case, the
choise is his; the only restraint is
a moral, not a physical one.

Non-church-aiiiiiated groups in-
clude particular groups organized
for a definite purpose, in this case
censorship of books. An example of
this type of organization is :1 “Stamp
Out the Smut“ club. There are also
groups who have general purposes,
such as a Communin Betterment
Society. One of these general pur-
poses is very often censorship.

These groups may try to pressure
local merchants into taking “offen-
sive” books of! the stands or, per-
haps, seek governmental legislation
to get rid of the “filth.”

Governmental censorship, which
is fairly liberal on a Federal level,
means the lawful removal of a book
from the reading public.

Undomocrutlc and lmmorol

it is my contention that these
latter twu categories, with the sole
exception of governmental censor-
ship of certain works, especially
seditious ones during wartime, are
undemocratic and immoral. Censor-
ship usurps the right of the individ-
ual to make his own choice.

Of course, it is a perfect right
of groups and government to inform
the citizenry of the value of a par-
ticular book, but this right should
not extend into the actual act of de-
priving people of reading materials
by outlawing the sales of these ma-
terials.
