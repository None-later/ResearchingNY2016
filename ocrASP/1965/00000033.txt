years the team was actually a

Golf Club and didn’t compete with
other schools on a varsity level
uptll 1961. Since then his teams

have compiled a 27-0-1 record and

Volleyball

In the final match.of the Thurs-
day volleyball league, Psi Gamma
defeated Sigma Alpha, 6-13, 11-4,
9-8, to finish undefeated and win
the championship of the league.

This was one of the best matches
in intramural competition this year
as both teams displayed excellent
teamwork. Linda Bergendahl, Joy
Swain, and Chris Massal sparked
Sigma Alpha in a great team ef-
fort, but Psi Gamma’s spiking by
Kathy Farnsworth and Bunny Whalen
proved to be the deciding factor of
the contest.

. Rayl’ieto of Sports I

It would not be proper to brush off the past basketball
season without officially congratulating the Feds on a
truly outstanding year. The cagers gave State fansa lot
to be proud of, and did it in an admirable way.

Before citing individual players, let’s look at the
season as a whole. The high point of the year was the
record-breaking winning streak, climaxed by an almost
unbelievable comeback win over powerful Plattsburgh.
The low point was the team’s losses to the University
of Buffalo and Ithaca College, thus eliminating the
Staters from any chance for a post-season tournament
bid.

The team averaged 68.5 points per game, and allowed
61.6 to the opposition. Coach Sauers called the 1964—
65 Peds “offensively, the best team I’ve ever had.”

The “six” starters — Dick Crossett, Dan and Bob
Zeh, Jim O’Donovan, Mike Bloom, and Ray Weeks —
are a talented and dedicated group of players who have,
collectively, given 17 years of basketball-playing to
State.

Dick Crossett led the team in scoring (17.8) and was
third in the nation among small colleges in shooting
percentage (.660). Coach Sauers called Crossett the
“best player I have ever coached.”

Dan Zeh led the team in rebounding (205) and aver-
aged 11.8 points per game. Dan set a Capital City
Tournament scoring record in a game with Marist
College, hitting for 38 points.

Jim O’Donovan was second on the team in rebounding
(201) and was also second in scoring (15.6). Jim was
the team's most consistent scorer throughout the sea-
son.

Bob Zeh and Ray Weeks teamed up in the first half
of the year to give State a formidable backcourt duo.
Weeks singlehandedly downed Cortland, hitting for 21
points in Albany’s 69—68 victory. Zeh was the Fed
playmaker, averaging only 6.1 per game, but con—
tributed many more with his timely assists.

Soph Mike Bloom took over Weeks' spot after in-
tersession, and has averaged better than seven points
per game thereafter. Mike, too, was a valuable asset
as a playmaker. '

To Coach Sauers and Peds -— our Sincere congratu-
lations.

quite a bit to come even close to
her accomplishments.

The people chosen with me for

She recognizes Israel as a new
nation with a developing national-

to understand these ideas." Last
year, the students in Israel worked
on a kibbutz, which is a small,

To Sue, her proposed summer in

to what last year'sexperimenters in
Israel have done. Although she lives
on a fruit farm near Niagara Falls,
a summer abroad is not a new ex-
perience for her.

In the summer of 1961, between
her Junior and Senior years in
Lewiston-Porter Senior High
School, Sue was the school's rep-
resentative to Norway for the
American Field Service Student Ex-
change Program, -Thls program is
similar to the Experiment, but on a
high school level.

Sue spent her summer in Norway
living with a Norwegian family.
Their home was on an island above
the Arctic Circle, and it provided
Sue with an experience which she
will never forget.

Sue is an English major and a
Library Science minor and hopes to
teach after graduation. She is cur-
rently the Junior ISC representative
for Psi Gamma as well as the Uni-
versity Songleader for this year.
She also participated in the '64
s. U. Revue.

While she knows no particulars
about the program at the present,
Sue hopes to learn more soon. She
is filling out personal information
forms now which will be used by
the Experiment to place Sue in a
family where she will be most at

ease.

Until arriving in Israel, Sue will
try to learn as much Hebrew as
possible. Just before she leaves
for Israel, she will have a group
orientation program. Then, she will
embark on what aha feels Promises
to be a "vary exciting and challeng-
ing summer."
