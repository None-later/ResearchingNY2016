News Takes Cooperation

The lack of consideration which has been shown to
us by various supposedly responsible people in the
past few days has registered one emotion — that of
disgust. '

In this case our complaint lies with Election Com-

mission and ex-S.A. President Art Johnston. We had
been promised the election results for ,Thursday
evening, and were not told until Saturday afternoon
that complete tabulations were being withheld. This
all resulted in a great deal of extra work and need-
less inconvenience for our staff.

This is unfortunately not an isolated instance, how-
ever. All too often we have had to almost drag stories
out of people which should have been brought into the
News Office as a matter of course. A case-in-point
here was the recent story on "The Tiger’s” being
selected to be presented at the Yale Drama Festival.

The Drama Department gave us no notification of
this significant achievement, and we came upon the
story almost entirely by chance.

The ASP exists to serve as a medium of commun-
ication for all facets of the University community. Un-
fortunately, we cannot infiltrate the entire campus with
reporters who can afford to “wait out” a story. We
need help in finding out where the current news is, and
what may make the headlines in the near future.

We attempt to cover the whole University situation,
but can only be truly successful when we are met with
cooperation.

y  Min
, The Unlvdreity Concert Band, un-
der the direction of William Hudson,
performed a concert in Psgeliellon
Friday that established its repute-
tion as one of the superior, music.
making groups in the area.

. The enthusiastic reception of the
concert by the smell crowd was
clearly the result of carotid plan-
ning and meticulous rehearsal. In
fact, the saddest aspect of the per-
formance was the fact that so few
people were there to appreciate it.

The band revealed a clarity of
texture but a warmth of tone that
was just right for the literature,
which included works by Moussor-
gsky, Vaughan Williams, Mennin,
and Sousa.

The first selections were per-
tions of Moussorgsky's "Pictures
at an Exhibition,” transcribed for
band by E. Leidzen. On suspects
that the transcription is taken from
the Ravel Orchestration rather than
from the original piano version be-
cause of similarities in the brass
writings in these transcriptions.

Varied Timhres

in any case, Mr. Hudson chose
‘three varied "Pictures," and the
band demonstrated- fine capabilities.
After the fine trumpet solo of the
"Promenade," the low brass of the
bandlumbered through the "Bydlo"
(Polish ox-cart) in just the right
manner.

“The Hut of Baba Yaga" featured
fine sharp attacks that were char-
acteristic of the playing throughout
the day, but were particularly fine
here. This piece could pose bal-
ance problems between the brass
and wood winds, but Mr. Hudson
kept all in good control.

The final selection of the ex-
cerpts was the “Great Gate of
Kiev," which was done with ap-
propriate grandeur and power,
leading to a fine climax.

Sharp Articulation
Next on the program was the
Vaughan Williams' “Folk Song
Suite."
Although a slighter work, the
band obviously enjoyed doing the
piece. Again the clear articula-

‘ tion and precise intonation was a

joy to hear.

in the first section particularly,
where a fast jig-time tune in the
clarinets is played over a tune In
the bass, did the band sound es-
pecially sharp. Mr. Hudson and the
section obviously worked very hard
on this.

The second section of the suite
is an intermezzo, scored for solo
wood winds and small groups of in-
struments. Here some of the play-
ing was a little ragged, but this
could very easily be attributed to
"performance jitters."

Kudos tor "Conzono"

Peter Mennin's “Canzona” Is a
work that somewhat belies its or-
igins. The inﬂuence of Schumnn,
Holst, and especially the piquancy
associated with Walton are in evi-
dence, but there is enough of Mell-
nin to make it exciting. The open-
ing bars were particularly fine.

The concert ended with a rous-
ing performance of Sousa's "El
Capitan“ mnrch. All in all, a su-
parlor concert, especially when you
recall that none of the players are
music majors, Mr. Hudson and the
band deserve highest praise.

Last S. A. President’s Address

It is traditional that by this point in the inaugural Ceremonies the for-
mer S. A. President is sitting in the audience, out there with you. He has
delivered his Farewell Address and the new President has delivered his
Inaugural and taken over the program as his first official act.

But there is no new Student Association President. There is no In-
augural Address, and what I have to say is not designed as 3 Farewell
Address per so.

It seems that I may be the last of the species, but I ask of you — let
us not mourn too long over his passing. You see, the species has been
really a “dead duck” since long before today. This fact has been painted
for many of us in vivid colors of black and blue. However, it is not
merely the species which has passed, it is the whole system which the
old bird represented that has passed with him. And the funeral — rather,
today’s celebration — has been held because one day some students stood
up full height for a change, looked into the red eyes of that old devil
Tradition and said, “DAMN YOU! YOU SHALL NO LONGER DAMN US!
WE REFUSE TO BE BOUND ANY LONGER TO AN OUTDATED SYSTEM
gUS’l‘ BECAUSE IT IS TRADITIONAL!" And on that day, and idea was

orn.

TRADITION MUST BE TESTED! Because the welfare of every mem-
ber of our community is concerned, we do not dare — you, the newly
elected officers and you out there, the foundation, you do not dare to
accept anything that is simply because it is and always has been. If it
doesn’t work anymore, if it has no rationale, GET RID OF‘ IT! bin in-
careful. Replace it with something meaningful, something with n ru-
tionale, something that works. And remember, we are all commnu-d
to being able to defend our purpose, our reasoning, our action at uni
time.

This process of meaningful change
is not an easy one. I’ll attest tothnt.

Now it is time to think hnrdnnd to
work hard. You, the Provisional
Council and you, the new MYSKANIA
have much to accomplish before May
1. You with your student body are in
a unique position in this endeavor
for you have at your fingertips the
promise of a government for your
community that is, withoutexaggcr-
uiion, unique in the world. There is
no other as deeply meaningful as
this one can be.

The commitment was ours;we are
gone. The commitment is now yours,
and I hope most sincerely, most
fervently that you can fulfill 1t.

THANK YOU ALI. l’OII A MOST
EXCITING YEAR!

This Friday eveninthhe Inter-
national Film Group.will present
“Touch of Evil," a film which is
one of the most effective blendings
of Orson Welles’ flamboyant style
with a suitable story.

Welles works best with plots of
a melodramatic or otherwise
"black" nature, such as the night-
marish “The Trial." Friday's film
deals with crime and corruption,
and is set in the depressing atmos-
phere of a small Mexican town.

Charlton Heston stars as “Mike”
Vargas, with Janet Leigh playing
his wife. These two become involved
with drug'smuggling and Hank Quin-
lan who, played by Welles himself,
is a crooked policeman, an ugly,
decaying mountain of flesh in acor-
rupi world he created.

Tile title paraphrases that "one
dram of evil," which Hamlet says
causes the infection and contam-
ination of the whole, however noble
in other ways it may be.

Suspended Melodrama

Welles has produced a fearful,
suspenseful melodrama, and yet has
also managed to make his own per-
sonal comments on society. In fact,
the two elements are really insep-
arable, for it is the dazzlingcraﬂs-
manship and manipulation of effects
which embodies the theme that
Welles wishes to present.

In "The Lady from Shanghai,"
Welles dramatized the corruption
of a lawyer, and in “Touch of Evil”
(made in 1958) he extends that par-
ticular world.

“Hank Quinlan is the incarnation
of everything I fight against politi-
cally and morally," Welles has
said. “ ‘Touch of Evil' is not
critical of plutocracy but of the
state, because the state is more
powerful than money."

Technically, this is one of Welles
most advanced films. All the inno-
vations and experiments of twaniy
years work reach a climax in this
picture.

Macabre Photography

The murder of Grandi (Akim Tain-
lruff) in the hotel room, with the
rapid cutting intensified by the on-
and-off blinking of the neon light,
is a terror triumph.

Tile macabre scenes at the motel
with the insance night watchman;
the sad decadence of the brothel
with its tinkling pianola and its
dreams of lost youth; the final
sequence up and over the huge
construction project; all establish
“Touch of Evil" as a masterpiece,
a Goya-like vision of on infected
universe.

in addition to liesinn, Leigh, and
Welles, the film also features Aklnl
Tamlrnff, liny Collins, Joseph Cul-
lein :uni Dennis \Veuvel’, with Max‘-
lene Dietrich :unl Zsu and [so Gubul‘
as “Guest Star's." The music is by
Henry Mancini. Showings will be in
Draper 349, at 7:00 and 9:15 p.m.
