To End Season at 5 - 4

In Friday’s match against Cobleskill College, the
Albany freshman wrestling team was defeated by a
score of 16-13. The match seemed to be an easy State
victory as the team won three of its first four bouts to
take an 11-3 lead. From then on, however, the Staters
were only able to score a tie.

As it does every year after the
final game, the State basketball team
selected an all-opponent all-Star

the team are Harvey Poe, Univer-
sity of Buffalo, Steve Halen, Ithaca
College, Tom Chapin, Plattsburgh
State, Ralph Buccini, Southern Con-
necticut University, Bob Gleason,
Montclair State, and Rich Kohier,
Oswego State.

Poe and Chapin were unanimous
selections. The choices were made
by the players immediately after
the Central Connecticut game from
a list .of players drawn up by coach
"Doc" Sauers.

' Council Appoints.

it New Members

The Provisional’Council, in its,

second official meeting Tuesday
night, appointed, 10 people, the bal-
ance of its membership.

As provided in the S. A. Consti-
tution, these appointees were chosen
as representatives of five areas of
university life.

. Those appointed to the Provisional

Council from living areas were Ed
Brovarski, Margery Pasko, and Judy
Riley. From community program-
ming Robert Peterson, Diane Som-
merville, and David Schenck were
appointed. Richard Thompson was
designated as the respresentatlve
for academic interests.

As representatives from com-
munications, Ronald Campisi and
Gary Spielmann were appointed. Fi-
nally, Eleanor Diener was appointed
as the delegate from religious in-
terests.

In its first meeting Sunday night,
the Provisional Council voted to
overrule err-President Arthur
Johnston’s decision to withhold the
results of last week’s school elec-
tions. At Tuesday's meeting, Elec-
tion Commissioner Roberta Joslin
explained why the tabulated results
have not been made public.

When it was pointed out to Miss
Joslin that the S. A. Constitution
gives the Council the power "to
provide for the election and tabu-
lation of all Student Association and
class elections," she replied that
she still refused to turn over the
tabulations to the Provisional Coun-
oil.

It was then moved and passed that
the Council refer this matter to
MYSKANIA.

In other business, Debby Fried-
man was appointed temporary chair-
man of finances, to handle the Feb-
ruary budget reports and to deal
with any emergency allocations (with
the Council’s approval) which might
be requested.

. Under this new program, groups

of 100-150 entering freshmen come
to Albany during the summer for
three days of testing, counseling,
and orientation.

Student assistants would live with
the freshmen in the residence halls,
each assistant being responsible for
about 20 freshmen. They would pro-
vide informal counseling, as well
as leading two formal group dis-
'cussions.

Bureaucratic Help

Among the other responsibilities
of the student assistants are to
help with various bureaucratic de-
tails, such as preparing packets,
assisting with registration, and
helping individual students to pre-
pare their fall schedules.

planned for the fresh, in which the
student assistants will be involved
to a great degree. informal dances,
volleyball games on the quad, and
a bus tour of the New Campus and
the city of Albany marked the pro-
gram last year.

Aside from their duties with the
prospective freshmen, the student
assistants will evaluate various as-
pects of the program, as well as
tabulnte the evaluations which the
fresh will provide. The evaluations
last year showed a high degree of
satisfaction with the program, and
proved quite valuable in planning
this summer's activities,

pected to attend a training session
from June 21-2". They will then
work at the conferences from June

Tower Burns

Fire swept the eighth story of the
dormitory lower of the second dor-
mitory complex on the New Campus
early Thursday morning. The fire
was preceded by explosions which
shook the area. Flames roared out
of control for hours, as firemen
were unable to reach the source of
the fire. No one was reported hurt.

The entire quadrangle is unoc-
cupied, and was not scheduled for
completion for another year. The
eighth floor had been poured on
Wednesday. Butane and kerosene
healers were being used to keep the
concrete warm as temperatures
went below the freezing point. The
heaters were blamed for tho explo-
sions and the fire which quickly,
spread through wooden forms and
covers.

The purpose of the discussion is
to increase understanding of the
various parts of the University re-
garding powers, rights, responsi-
bility and attitudes on the differ-
ent controversial issues confront-
ing the University.

The next program of the Golden
Eye will be Friday, April 2. The
program will feature members of
the IFG and professors who will
explore censorship of movies.

The panel will contain three mem-
bers of the IFG, Paul Jensen, Ar-
thur Loder, Ian Leet and Dave
Hughes, and three faculty mem-
bers, Mr. Harry Staley, Dr. Robert
Donovan and Dr. Arthur Lennlg.
Dr. Lennlg is a professor at Siena
College and founded IFG when he
was a student at State.
