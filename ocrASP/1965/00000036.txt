Philippe. Entremont, who saw his ‘

out triumphs whileetillin his

teens, has become in thepest decade ‘

an internationally-known artist. He
has 'been hailed on six continents
as dne of the major pianists now
performing, and at thirty, he is a
veteran of the concert stage.

There has‘ been a steady growth
in the career of Philippe Entremont,
which has been accompanied by a'
flow of Entremont praises in the
press. He has been acclaimed as a
“Titan of the piano" and a “master
of the keyboard." -

liis playing has been called “elec-
trifying” and a Paris newspaper
has termed him “le pianiste atom-
lque."

During the past few seasons, En-
tremont has appeared with the Phil-
adelphia Orchestra and the New York
Philharmonic, in conderts and in
recording sessions for Columbia
Records. His solo records of the
music of Debussy, Chopin, and Tch-
aikovsky have been among the best-
selling record albums.

Entremont made his first Ameri-
can television appearance in l963,
on the Bell Telephone Hour. During
the 1964 season, he performed in
New York City with the Vienna
Symphony, and appeared in three
concerts of piano-violin sonatas at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

In the coming year, Entremont
will give three recitals in the New
York City area; these concerts will
be in Carnegie Hall, at the Frick
Museum, and in Mineola, Long Is-

FRAT PLEDGING BEGINS in typical style with pledgeboolrs,

antics and the inevitable cafeteria pranks.

Frat Pledging Period Begins;

Adds Color to

That time of year has come again
for the five fraternities on campus
to start their pledging period for
second semester. This period in the
past has added color and humor to
life on campus, and rarely goes un-
noticed because of the “hell” that
is usually raised.

Though each fraternity has a dif-
ferent purpose in having a pledge
period, the main idea behind it cen-
ters around the assimilation of the
pledges into the group to meet the
brothers of the frat. The pledges
are also expected to learn the his-
tory and traditions of the organi-
zation and its purposes.

This encompasses different things

Casting auditions for the Univer-
sity Theatre’s production of “The
Misanthrope,” by Moliere, will be
held in Page Hall on Monday, Tues-
day, and Wednesday, March 15, 16
and 17 from 7:30-9:80 p.m. The
play, which will be directed by Pro-
fessor James Leonard, will be
staged in Page Hall on May 7, 8.

University Theatre productions
are presented by the Department of
Speech and Dramatic Art with the
cooperation of the Dramatics Coun-
cil. Participation in these produc-
tions are open to all students in-
terested in acting, stagecraft, or
design.

Script on Reserve

Anyone interested in researching
the roles of “The Misanthrope,”
may consult the play's soript,which
is on reserve in Hawley Library.
There are five major male roles,
two minor male roles, and three
major female roles.

Leonard noted that the lead char-
acter Aiceste. sets the tone of the

czar/m rm yams worm”

play. Alcesie is atragicomic figure,
a reformer of society who cannot
reform sooiety.

Alceste is mad at society; he is
proud, dogmatic, jealous, and pos-
sesses a sense of perfection. By
contrast, Celimene is agay, twenty-
year old widow, who is completely
at home in the superflciality of so-
ciety. Celimene is fickle and effer-
vescent.

Other Roles

The other major female roles are
Eliante and Arsinoe. Eliante is
warm, gentle, philosophical, and tol-
erant. Arsinoe is a prude and a
hypocrite, she is catty and dom-
ineering.

Other major male roles are
Oronte, Acaste, Phillnte, and Cli-
tandre. Oronte is a ' ‘would-be poet,”
a very ingratiating figure. Philante,
who along with Eliante, is the mod-
erating inﬂuence in the play, is the
person who is able to find ahapr
medium with the Alceste-Cellmene

extremes.

 

Campus life

in the various fraternities. In APA
work parties are organized to help
i iprove the bone. The pledges, as

in other irats, have to carry a
pledge book containing the names of
the brothers and the history, con-
stitution of the brotherhood.

Brother's Signature

At the end of the affiliation per—
iod they are expected to have had
all the brothers' signatures in the
book.

in Potter Club the pledges learn
the songs of the club and the history
of Edward Potter from whom the
frat got its name. The pledges also
help put out an Alumni Newsletter.

The brothers of SLS induct their
pledges to “perpetrate social life
on campus and fulfill objectives
stated in this charter and consti-
tution.” This is done through con-

‘structive tasks for the brothers.

Frat Meetings

TXO requires their pledges to
attend fraternity meetings in order
for them to learn how the club op-
erates. Some of their duties include
the clearing of tables in the cafe-
teria and improvements around the
school.

After their pledging period is
ended, they go through an initiation
night. Before a pledge can become
a brother most fraternities require
that he make a paddle which he
uses in inducting other pledges into
the organization.

After the initiation the members
are soon formally inducted into the
fraternity as a full brother.

Editorial autonomy was
strongly endorsed. The
government called for the
deletion of a clause from
the paper’s constitution.
The clause sanctions the prior
reading of paper's copy by the
President, Vice President for stu-
dent Affairs and/or the Editorial
Adviser. The President assured the
editor of "News" that the clause
would not be invoked as long as the
newspaper retained “a standard of
responsible journalism."

Paper Financed by Faculty

The school’s paper is financed
through the University and not by
the student body and, as a result,
the Administration has the right to
censor the publication.

The president had demanded that
a front-page statement by him be
primed and that an article dealing
with a committee appointed to study
the “News” be printed “in a prom-
inent position."

Werner Buncschuh, editor of the
paper, called the demand a step
towards censorship of the publi-
cation. The Student Congress backed
Buncschuh's statement, called the
proposal a direct Violation of the
students’ right to freedom of the
press, and urged its withdrawal.

Congress Proposes

The Congress proposed that the
editors of the paper remain on to
May with editorial freedom and that
Congress representatives, editors
and Case meet then to select a staff
for the following year and set a
policy to guide the publication.

The Congress also called for a
rally by the students to inform
them of the situation with the
“News.”

The story of the controversy ap-
peared in the Boston newspapers
and was broadcast over the city's
radio and television networks.

Case in an interview said that
his decision to censor the paper
precipitated by the paper’s distor-
tion of the news in recent months.

He also announced that a com-
mittee would be formed to “look
over” the University communica—
tions media. He expressed his hope

at a meeting with the newspaper’s editors.

that this committee would present
recommendations to resolve the
problem.

Student Petition

At the outset of the disagreement
a petition was circulated throughout
the student body. It called for the
reorganization of the paper giving
the Student Congress the sole right
to publish it. '

This would createlan independent
paper, owned and published by the
students. The budget of the paper
would be transferred to the student
government. If‘the majority of the
student body signs the petition, it
will be presented to Case.

The students hold that this is in
accordance with the Committee on
Faculty Responsibility for Academic
Freedom of Students which states
that the "academic community re-
quires freedom to exchange infor—
mation and ideas. The faculty should
promote and sustain institutional
policies which will provide students
the freedom to establish their own
publications and to conduct them
free of censorship or of adminis-
trative determination of content or
editorial policy.”

IFG to Present ‘Ivan the Terrible’

by G. P. Mintmus

“Ivan the Terrible,” Partl,which
the International Film Group will
present tomorrow night, is con-
sidered the culminating masterpiece
of the Russian Film genius Sergei

9‘ ‘ ‘ , ten “ ed the
“most influential film director who
ever lived.”

Indeed, Eisenstein’s work was so
important that only six feature films
of his were released in the twenty-
five years that he worked in the
medium, his inﬂuence was so per-
vasive that in the 1962 poll of 100
critics conducted by “Sight and
Sound” magazine, Eisenstein took
first place with 44 votes as "most
important director.”

Along with D. W. Griffith, Eisen-
stein is considered one of the found-
ing fathers of the cinema. Eisten-
Stein’s particular contribution lay
in the area of what one might call
the “Intellectual Cinema.“

“Monument

His early films all reflect a pre—
occupation with “montage,” a term
coined by Eisenstein and difficult to
define. Basically, it might be said
to be a method ofeditingto correlate
all the senses and symbols to achieve
a certain emotional and intellectual
effect.

When Eisenstein turned to the
sound medium, he was able to bring
another element of his filmtheories
into play. He strongly believed that

the film score and dialogue could
also be brought into correlation with
the visual montage.

In 1941, the Mosiiim studios de-
cided to produce an historic film on
Ivan the Terrible. Historical films
had proven popular, and because-
F‘ ‘ ‘ had had good luck with
“Alexander Nevsky,” (which the
IFG showed last year), he was chosen
to direct "lvan."

Eisenstein was fortunately given
a free hand in the writing of the
script, and in the shooting of“Ivan."
The result was a very strong, con-
trolled film with a unique editorial
and visual style even today.

“This is a story of a man —-
not a legend,“ reads the opening
title. It was clearly the director's
intention to show the anguish and
loneliness of his historical per-
sonality.

Stylization

Consequently, there is a lot of
operatic, stylized acting in the film.
Each gesture does not always look
natural, but always manages to con-
vey the emotion felt. The sets, too,
convey this natural feeling with on-
natural means. For example,thelow
arches in the castle add a claustro-
phobic effect that accentuate lvan’s
isolation.

Music is thoroughly integrated
into the movie. Serge Prokofiev had
worked harmoniously with Eisten-
stein on “Nevsky,” and created
perhaps a finer score here.
