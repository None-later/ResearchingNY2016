The ,poor clergyman, a Warden
of‘ New College, Oxford, made -so
many flubs of this’kind that his
name became a byword. A funny
phrase that results from the
scrambling of words or letters is
still known as a "spoonerism."

This type of word was not what
Martin Luther had in mind when
the Reformation leader said, "He
that. has but one word of God before
him, and out of that word cannot

,r'nalre a sermon, can never be a
preacher." ’

But some ministers have taken
the word of God and gone to as-
tounding lengths with it.

In February, 1955, Clinton Locy
of West Richland, Washington, set
a world's record - by delivering
a sermon that last 48 hours and 18
minutes and ranged through texts
from every book in the Bible!

' Sermon Marathon

During this marathon, Locy sus-
tained himself by sipping lemon
juice, eating vegetable — and wrap-
ping a wet towel around his head.

If anyone had sat through his
entire sermon,-he said, “they would
have heard as much Gospel as they
would get in a year at church."
Remarkably, eight people were on
hand for the close.

touched upon, Matthew and Luke,

1946 the Senate ratified the United
Nations’ Charter. ‘

The theme of the UN is to “save
future generations from the scourge
of war." Thus far, it has managed
to keep war from magnifying out of
proportion — as in Korea (1950),‘
Suez (1956), and the Congo (1960).

Blg Headache

The biggest drawback to U. N.
effectiveness is, without doubt, the
Security Council. Why is this true?
Unlimited veto by the “Big Five"
virtually hamstrings police action
and the discussion of “substantive”
questions. (The Russians have dem-
onstrated well the power of un-
limited veto.)

To date, they have exercised the
veto over a hundred times. In 1950,
however, the Russian “nyet” was
by-passed when the Soviet Union
boycotted the Security Council for
its refusal to admit mainland China.

Dues Causing Dissension

At present, the most vehement
“procedural” question before the
General Assembly is that of DUES.
Article 19 of the UN Charter states
this concerning the question of dues:
“A Member of the United Nations
which is in arrears in the payment
of its financial contributions...sball

have no vote in the Gene _
bly ii the amount of itséarrears
equals or exceeds the amount...due
from it for the preceding two full
years."

Russia and other soviet-bloc na-
tions have repeatedly refused to pay
their dues. During the Congo crisis,
the Russians failed to contribute
their portion forpeace-keeping ef-
forts. According to them, the as-
sessments were illegal.

U. S. Largest Contributor

As a result, the United States
has virtually kept the UN alive.
The U. 8. lead has been followed
by few other nations, but the Rus-
sians have still persisted in their
refusal.
' This refusal has prompted the
United States to call for the en-
forcement of Article 19, which calls
for the revocation of voting rights
in the Assembly. Thus far, the As-
sembly has avoided a vote on “pro-
cedural” matters, in order to avoid
a U. S.-Sovlet showdown.

Not Perfect_
It is clearly evident that the

-,Wo.r¢

United Nations. is not the perfect
organisation. ln_fact,,the' UN has
been accused of being a sounding
board for .U. S. andSoviet factions.

All is not lost for the organi-
zation. One big suggestion for.th
UN is the elimination of the vote.
It is felt that the United States has
nothing to hide and should not be.
upset if the veto departs.

As for the problem of dues, there
is no ready solution for this. What
will be gained to have the Russians
lose their assembly vote if they
still have their Security Council
veto? Until a workable solution is
found, this is something the U. S.
will have to accept.

Oblect - Universal Peoce

Despite its shortcomings, the Uni-
ted Nations is the only tangible at-
tempt to prevent war. The work-
ings of United Nations are summed
up in Article I, Secion 2: “To de-
velop friendly relations among na-
tions based on respect for the prin-
ciple of equal rights and sell-de-
termination of peoples, and to take
other appropriate measures to
strengthen universal peace."

.l litany: censors seem to feel that
it" is 'an adequate substitue for

any of-a variety of earthy, four-

. letter , Anglo-Saxon words.

_ [don't really understand the rea-
soning behindthis, but, to conjec-

= lure, it seems that if the reader is
h old enough to comprehend the mean-

ing of the original word, his imag-
ination is capable of tellinghim what
the missing word was.

The reader, specifically the
young, to whom the word would
meaning nothing is not introduced
to the vile word.

Pure Mind Maintained
In either case, the horrendous
four letters neVer find their way
into print and so the pure rﬁind is
supposed to maintain its likeness
to the driven snow.

This kind of reasoning is ill-r.

lacious. The replacement of the
four letters by asterisks, or sim-
ilar marks, hardly troublesthewitty
reader who digs into his repertoire
and finds that dozens of extremely
suitable words fit the contest.

The young, guilelese reader will

wonder why the asterisks were put '

there. With an aroused curiosity,
the youngster may find friends eager
to, help him in quest for knowledge.

Forbidden words are actually vei‘y
helpful to society. For one thing,
frustrated individuals can verbally
perform forbidden action. Anger is
sublimated into words, not physical
violence. Also the use of dirty words
gives a feeling of comradeship to
certain groups.

Alluring Question \
The question of how far is too *

 

by Anne Digney

It is not at all uncommon to hear freshmen speak
longineg of the Rivalry that they never had. It is, in-
deed, unfortunate that such an experience is no longer
possible.

However, it is even more unfortunate that these very
freshmen have neglected to replace this temporary in-
troduction to college life with the activities Rivalry had
been designed to foster.

Participation in theatre productions is an example of
such neglect. Faculty, work crews. and production staff
have long encouraged the student body to “participate.”
Those students who have realized the need for con-
structive extracurricular interests have opened for
themselves a new world — a world in which they not
only learn a great deal but meet people and form
friendships which give an individual reason to be in-
terested in this school and its activities.

Opportunities and Needed

The interested student will find that there is much
more to be offered than hammering nails and painting
sets. The great opportunities (and great needl) for
creative talent of all kinds are endless. In addition to
such opportunities, participation in theatre wouldprob-
ably lead to membership in Dramatics Council, which
has long proven itself to be one of the finest groups on
campus.

Dramatics Council, whose purpose it is to further in-
terest in theatre as well as to provide staff for the
State University Theatre productions, also playsa most
significant part in bringing to this University the fine
entertainment that we have all enjoyed. It was by de-
cision of Dramatics Council that we saw Mata and Hari,
Emlyn Williams, and the Herrick Marionnettes.

SUT Productions

Drumatics Council has also a voice in the selection
of State University Theatre productions. Membership
in Dramatics Council is achieved by acquiring eighty
“points,” awarded on the basis of participation in
theatre productions, S. U. Revue, etc.

Each show that is produced on this campus offers
us much opportunity for learning and “living” as the
Rivalry skits which we all look back on with such fond
memories. Perhaps the elimination of Rivalry has of-
fered a great challenge to personal initiative. it would
indeed be very disconcerting to think that thirty-five
hundred students cannot meet such a challenge, not
only in theatre, but in so many student activities.

Experience Not Necessary

 

 

alluring question which seem to, W
fascinate the literate public. The,

discussion of what should and should
not be allowed: provides sestful
topics of‘discuesion at dull parties.‘

The alert censor will now lump
up and say that if forbidden words
are helpful to society’s mental health
they obviously must remain dirty to

i

continue to serveutheir functions.

But if' they are to remain dirty,
then they must be labelled as such
by the courts. if the courts perform
such an action then the books must
be censored to reinforce the idea
that these words are not allowable.

Don’t worry, the censor is, once
again, incorrect. The words that
were dirty forty years ago are still
dirty today, even after appearing
myriad times in print. The reason
for this is that these words are
still not publicly accepted, that is,
it would not be considered proper
to .use any of these words in normal
social intercourse.

Naturally, as long as these words
are not publicly accepted, they re-
tain their usefulness as dirty words
and so, excepting aesthetic and
moral reasons, dirty words should
not be censored for merely being
dirty.

Aesthetics and Morality

Aesthetically it must be granted
that certain four-letter words are
not pleasing to the ear. But it must
also be granted that certain others
are very euphonious indeed. No
aesthete can say that every socially
acceptable word is harmonious.
Four-letter words just add more
members to both the pleasing and
the displeasing groups.

Many have argued that the use
of dirty words is morally wrong.
The four letters, per se, are mean-
ingless. it is the idea or action they
represent that makes them dirty.
Should these actions be considered
things to be written about using a
certain arrangement of letters (ac-
cepted clinical descriptions) but not
with another (namely, four-letter)
arrangement?
