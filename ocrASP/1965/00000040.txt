Student Offers Solution
To Problem in lounge

To the Editors:

As an interested observer, may I
comment brieﬂy on the PDA prob-
lem and offer a possible solution
solution which shouldn’t be too dif-
ficult to execute?

The PDA problem is especially
peculiar to a university community
and, as such, can only be solved by
the understanding and cooperation of
students, faculty, houseparents and
administrators alike.

The physical setup of a modern
university campus should include
an area in or near tiie main lounge
where collegiates could indulge in
their normal extracurricular ac-
tivities, i.e. “peticlpaiion” ( my
new term for smooching) safely
and decorously, without the dangers
inherent in a lover's lane, dark
city park, or hotel. Even our Puri-
tan forebears recognized the need
for the bundling device.

My suggestion is this. Section or
curtain off part of a lounge in some
way (to be worked out), call it the
“Bundling Room," “Mushroom,”
or any aesthetic equivalent thereof,
where students could peticipate, and
which room would be available at
designated times only.

if necessary (and probably, from
the viewpoint of parents and admitt-
istratioh alike, it would be), an
added “safeguard” might include
a chaperone who would unobtrusive-
ly "check" her "watch" through
her bifocais occasionally.

Why not give it a whirl, say at
Brubacher first. if it succeeds in
that currently stormy ai'on, extend
it to the other dorms, and, it the
plan works generally, other coi-
leges might profit from our success.

would like to add a complaint about
the behavior oi certain couples in
the main buildings of the campus.

More than once upon going to my
locker, I have been embarrassed
to find a necking session going on
next to it. And it seems that some
couples find it impossible to walk
in the corridors of Draper or on
Western Avenue between the cam-
pus and the English Annex without
exchanging a kiss atevery few steps.

The presence of the faculty is no
deterrent to such displays.

I could read the thoughts of the_
mother of a young girl who was ob-
viously here for an interview when
one of our devoted couples passed
through Draper. “What kind of a
place am i sending my daughter to
for four years?" was what she was
thinking.

Personally, i couldn’t care less
what these students do in private
(they seem, by the way, tube mostly
freshmen and sophomores), but I
do care about what goes on In pub-
lic.

it seems to the to be not only it
breach of taste bill also a sign of
gross immaturity to make one’s
affection for one's boyfriend or
girlfriend in public matter. It is “10
equivalent of saying, "We’ve grown
up now and have found out till uhoui
love and we want everybody to know
how grown—up we are."

A mature relationship between
two persons is it personal, private
thing and it should not be cheupchcd
as these couples are cbcapcniug
theirs.

Thank you for allowing me to

Dr. Augustine Zitelli, Associate

has been appointed a language in-

structor for the Peace CorpsTrain- '

ing Program. Dr. Zitelii’s will work
with Peace Corps trainees who are
bound for Brazil. He will instruct
them in in Portugese.

Dr. Zitelli was notified of his
appointment via a telephone call
from Washington, D. C. He had ap-
plied at the Peace Corps General
Headquarters on February 26.

The purpose of the Peace Corps
Training Program is to provide
volunteers with an extensive back-
ground in language and customs of
their particular country.

instructors, in addition to regu—
lar classroom teaching, will take
their meals with their language
groups; all conversation will be in
Portuguese. It is hoped that this
will facilitate language fluency.

After ten weeks of this intensive
training, the trainees will be sent
to Brazil, where they will begin
their eighteen months of active
Peace Corps service.

Emeritus of English at SUNY at
Albany was given conspicuous bill-

The review of Miss Futierer’s

Monodrama, according to J. M.

that has never been overcrowded.
“Now,” says Mr. Limbacher,
“comes a recording of Lady Win—

For spoken word collections, Mr.
Limbacher considers thispresentu-

containing dialogue andepigranis
which come throughin"goodsty1c."

Miss F'utterer’s recording is
available through the University
Book Store and the John Mistletoe
Book Shop in Albany. Mail orders
may be sent to Mary K. O’Donnell,

The first play will be "A Mor—
ality Play for the Leisured Class"
by John L. Baldei'ston, directed by
Paul Jensen. Appearing as the Soul

and ends on a surprising and “off-
beat” note.

“Lord Byron’s Love Letter" by
Tennessee Williams, directed by
Cindy Gale, concerns the reality
behind the genteel facade pre-
sented by two southern ladies.

Diane Soinerville and Paula Mi—
chaels play the Spinster and Old
Woman. Dennis Willard and Jane
Leipiiisel appear as the couple who
so crudely barge inonthcirsecludcd
home.

“A Dollar” by David l’iiiski, di-
rected by Sheila Brown saiii'izes
the materialistic desire for money.
This theme is presented by sym—
bolic characterization. The coin—
paiiy of traveling players includes
William Mayer us the Comedian,
William Gross us the 'i'i'agedian,
Dimitri Pci'dai'is us the Villain,
Maria Georgiopulos as the llci'o'iuc,
Diane Mohegan us thr- iiigenue, :ind

Speaking in Page Hall last Fri-
day afternoon Harry Schwartz, N.
Y. Times Editorialist and Specialist
on Soviet Affairs, discussed the
current political triangle existing
among the Soviet Union, the United
States, and China.

Vietnam, of course, was also
interwoven itito the lecture as a
present situation in which Schwartz
acknowledged that the United States
is indeed “taking risks."

Unexpected by U. S. observers
has been the recent development
in Moscow which served to drive
the Soviet and Chinese camps even
further apart both politically and
ideaiogicaily than they werea month
ago.

Cited Demonstrations

Schwartz cited the demonstration
in front of the U. S. Embassy in
Moscow by a group of Asian Cuban
and Russian studentsprotesting U.S.
action in Vietnam. The U.S. Em-
bassy incurred fair-sized damages,
for which the Russian government
offered to make amends.

At the same time, a note of pro-
test frotn Peking concerning Soviet
police brutality to Asian students,
brought a refusal on the part of
Moscow to accept the note, and
eventually lead to a flood of anti-
Soviet propaganda by the Chinese.

Peking adopted the viewthat holds
Russian-Chinese aims to be ex-
tremely diverse, in that the Chinese
consider U. S. - Soviet aims more
compatible with the possibility of
cooperation between the two powers
at any titiie.

Racist Propaganda

in the last few years the Sina-
Soviet dispute, according to
Schwartz, has assumed racisiover-
tones. China regards the world
through Marxist eyes to take the
form of an international class
struggle which has pitted the Afro-
Asian camp against lie Whites.

Nationalism was stressed as an
important motivating element by
Schwartz. lie asserted that the
world's ideological boundaries have
been replaced by those of national
self-interests, resulting in chaos
for Communist and non-Communist
countries. Significant for Americans
is the fact that this split provides
a “safer” climate for the U. S.
