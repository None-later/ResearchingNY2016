THE EXPANDED CENTRAL Council Committee concentrates on

dovision a compromise between the various viewpoints concerned

with the Council's ultimate role.

Council to

Coordinate

Intercollegiate Activities

A movement initiated by Siena College to form the
Capital Districtlntezfcollegiate Council for the seven

_. _.,.. _-,..._ _.. . ,. .

area colleges became a reality Sunday, March 21 when
representatives from the individual schools met to dis-
cuss the framework of the Council. Joseph Mahay and
Marjory Pasko. both members of the Provisional Coun—
cil, represented Albany at the conference.

Albany to organize

civil Rights loan
for Summer Work

Albany State has been asked to
send a team of workers to partici-
pate in the Summer Community Or-
ganization and Political Education
Project (SCOPE). SCOPE has re-
cently been organized under the
auspices of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference.

SCOPE's intention is to recruit
more than 500 persons from the
academic communities of America
to work for 10 weeks during the
summer in Bl rural and urban
southern counties.

The program consists of voter
registration in connection with the
work of local organizations and
political education under a system
of night classes for those of voting
age.

An open meeting of those inter-
ested in going this summer or help-
ing in the recruitment and organ-
ization of a team will be held Mon-
day, April 5, at 9 [mm in Bru.

Sue Boyd, one of the students at
the original meeting commented:

“Governor Wallace and Selma,
Alabama are just one expression of
the Negro situation in the Southern
United States. Willi that man and
that town in mind, just think of
what the Negro has lived with that
we have not heard about.

“it’s time for us to commit our-
SeiVes to the struggle between the
forces of justice and non-justice
in the South. it's time to get per-
sonally involved, mentally and phys-
icaliy, in a less spectacular way,
to give encouragement, energy, and
love to our Negro brothers in the
South."

Last year a similar project was
undertaken to send four State stu-
dents to North Carolina during Eas-
ter Recess for a voter registration
drive. ‘

 

They met with students
from Siena, RPI, Union,
Skidmore. Russell Sage.
and St. Rose.At the meet-
ing they discussed the con-
stitutional proposals that
were drawn up by Siena.

The “Siena News" stated that
the Council would act as “a forum
for the exchange of ideas, with
which to improve various aspects
of student government and student
life."

The Council would have no power,
but would only offer suggestions to
the member school.

Benefits Derived

Many benefits would be derived
from the Council by the various
schools involved. The Councilwould
coordinate publicity for concerts
and lectures taking place in the in-
dividual schools. Each college would
have a central ticket office which
would sell tickets for these events.

Skidmore College offered the sug-
gestion that schools co-sponsor
events. By this joint sponsorship,
activities could be held that would
be too expensive for an individual
school to undertake before.

The main problem that faces the
Council is the summer vacations
during which its support might die
out. Future plans for the confedera-
tion include expansion of its mem-
bership to include junior colleges
and professional schools.

or New idea

The idea for the formation of the
Council originated three years ago
by the Liberty Party on the Siena
Campus. it was met with little en-
thusiasm until recently when Tom
McCarthy, vice, president of Siena
Senate, hogan contacting leaders
from the various school’s student
government.

The first meeting of all the schools
except Albany was held Saturday,
March '7 at Union College. They set
the groundwork for the Council and
drew up proposals to be discussed
at the following meeting.

 

APRIL 2'. 1965,

by Harold Lynne
Provisional Council will
meet at 2 pm. in Bru-

/bacher, Sunday in an at-

tempt to reconcile opposing
viewpoints and approve an
initial draft for the new
Student Association consti-
tution. ‘

At last Sunday night's Provisional
Council meeting, the proposal sub-
mitted by the Central Council Com-
mittee met considerable opposition
from the majority of Council mem-
bers.

It was this committee’s task to
define the duties and powers of
Central Council, the legislative and
executive branch of the proposed
student government.

Expanded Committee

After a few hours of heated debate
on the Central Council proposal at
the meeting Sunday night, it was
decided that the problem could be
solved more readily by referring it
to an expanded Central Council Com-
mittee.

The new committee includes the
members of the original committee
as well as the chairman from each
commission area, several members
of the faculty, and two representa-
tives from MYSKANI-A; ' - r  ' "

This new committee heldits first
meeting Tuesday night. At thistime,
it was decided that much of the prob-
lem could be alleviated by drawing
up a preamble which clearly states
the basic philosophy of the govern-
ment revision project.

The expanded Central Council
Committee will meet again tomor-
row when lt is expected that a pre-
amble will be drafted on the basis
of a preamble subcommittee’s pro-
posal. Also, one or two items may
be changed in the list of powers
and responsibilities delegated to
the Central Council.

Government Structure
The proposed struoture for the
new student government if it is

Civil Rights leader
in Sneak in Page
[in Rule ot Still:

LaFayette Surney will speak today
at 1:25 p.m. in Page Hall on the
role of the Student Non-Violent Co-
ordinating Committee in the South.
Surney is sponsored by the Uni-
versity Freedom Council.

Originally John Lewis, the na-
tional chairman of SNCC, was sched-
uled to speak today but because of a
severe beating he received lnSelma
he had to cancel his engagement.

Surney has been active in SNCC
since 1001 when it first entered his
home county of Sunflower, Missis-
sippi. lie was project director of
the Mississippi Summer Project in
Clarksdale, Mississippi.

His recent activities have been
in Dallas County where he is trying
to get Negroes to register to vote.
Earlier in the year he was elected
to the Executive Connnittee ofSNCC.

Since his participation] in the Civil
Rights Movement, he has been ar-
rested six times while taking part
in a march.

Surney will also discuss the ro~
cent developments in the Civil Rights
movement emphasizing the recent
march from Selma to Montgomery
in which he took part.

Following the speech, there will
be a coffee hour where interested
students can ask Surney questions.

  

approved in a school-wide refer-
endum will entails system based
on five commission areas: living
areas, academic interests, com-
munications, community program-
ming, and religious interests.

Above these five commission
areas, which encompass all aspects
of student life, will be 3 Central
Council. This Council would func-
tion as the coordinating unit of Stu-
dent Association by having vested
in it legislative and executive pow-
ers.

Although the Central Council will
legislate on general Student Asso-
ciation policies, the commissions
will be granted a great latitude of
autonomy within their respective

areas of concern.

Vacation Conference

Most of the work on the Com-
mission constitution and the orig-
inal Central Council proposal was
done in a four-day conference held
March 25-28. The members ofPro-
visional Council returned to Albany
on Thursday, March 25, and spent
that night and the next two days
working intensively in small com-
mittees. »

Working with these committees
were six members of MYSKANIA,
several members of the adminis-
tration, and about ten special ad-
visers invited by the various com-
mission area committees.
