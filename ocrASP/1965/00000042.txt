Hall. This ‘stage presentation is
sponsored by the University Dra-
matlcs Council.

Appearing for the first time in
sixteen years of National Players
touring repertory, “Hamlet” was
an immediate sellout among tour-
ing sponsors, attesting to the time-
less‘;humanity of the play as well
as its enduring popularity.

A play of action, poetry and cm.

tional power, "Hamlet" is the most

personal and yet the most universal
of Shakespeare’s works.

University Theater Box Office,

$1.50 or Student Tax.

ampbs of dances will be demon-
strated. Commentary on the music

Each dancer is well known in her

Opportunities in buslness, indus-

In its annual report for 1963-64,
prepared by Dr. Clinton J. Roberts,

veals that 467, or 96%‘01 a total

Positions Increase

Dr. Roberts‘forecasts a sizeable
increase in the number of teaching

This weekend, the international

fine films. As in previous weeks,
the pictures will represent the best
of both American and foreign pro-
duction.

For the convenience ofthe student
body, however, a change has been
made in the scheduling. "On the
Waterfront” was originally to be
shown Friday evening, at 7and9:15,
with “The Rules of the Game" Sat-

L..in Concert Tomorrow

Pianist to Give
Page Concert

Music Council will sponsor its
last major concert of the season
tomorrow night when Philippe En-
tremont, world-renowned pianist,
will appear in concert in Page
Hall, at 8:15 p.m.

American T.V. audiences coast-
to-coast first met Entrelnont in
1063 on the Telephone Hour. Dur-
ing tlle 1064 season, Entremont
appeared in New York City witll the
Vienna Sylnphony and did three con-
certs of piano-violin sonatas at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.

In 1905 he will give three re-
citals in the New York City area;
his first in Carnegie Hall tilen at the
Frick Musewn and at Mineolu. He
first appeared in this country in
1964.

There has been a steady growth
in Entremont’s career. He has been
llaiied on six continents as one of
the malor pianists of our age, and,
at thirty, he is a veteran of the
concert stage.

A limited number of tickets will
be available at the Page Hall Box
Office for $3.00 or Student Tax.

now be seen both Friday and Sat-
urday at 7:00 each evening. “The
Rules of the Game" will also be
shown both evenings, at 9:15.

Thus, either film may be *en
either evening.

"On the Waterfront" is concerned
with today’s waterfront gangster-
ism. Filled with brutal violence, it
follows an inarticulate longshore-
man’s slow, reluctant transition
from an "I look out for me" phil-
osophy to the willingness to risk
his. life for what he believes to be
right. .'

Marian Brando stars, with Lee
J. Cobb as a corrupt union boss,
Eva Marie Saint as the sister of a
murdered iongshoreman, Karl Mal-
den as a waterfront priest, and
Rod Steiger as Brando’s brother.

Directed by Elia Kazan, from a
script by Budd Schulberg, the pic-
ture also features background music
by Leonard Bernstein.

in 1954, it received Academy
Awards for best film, best actor,
best supporting actress, best di-
rection, as well as four others.

French "Rules"

"The Rules of the Game” is ..
French film, with English subtitles,
written and directed by Jean Renoir
(nephew of the famous painter.)

Renoir also appears in the cast
of the picture, which only recently
became available in its original
full-length version.

Generally thought to be among
the towering masterpieces of the
cinema, it is the mordant sophis-
ticated, brilliantly funny tragedy
of a man of feeling in a society
which, on the even of World War
[1, had no use for it.

Praised by “Sight and Sound”
magazine as “one of the most re-
markable French films ever made,
its theme is much similar to many
very contemporary films about a
society out of touch with sensibili-
ties, such as “La Doice Vita" and
“L’Avventura.”

Both films will be presented ill
Draper 349; admission to “On the
Waterfront ,’ ' will be 36¢, and “Rules
of tile Game" will be 50‘}.

tatives have been coming to us
seeking future graduates and grad-

The bureau report states that
teaching salaries ranged from slow
of $4600 for an English teacher with
a B.A. and no experience to a high
of $6440 for a business teacher
with an M.S. degree and no teaching
exnerience.

Industry Seeks Grads

Science teachers and librarians
were in greatest demand in 1964.
The social studies field showed
evidence of an over-supply. During
the year 229 calls were received
for college instructiors and admin-
istrators, representing an increase
of 79 over 1963.

While the report reflects the
teacher preparation of many SUA
graduates, more than 50 represen-
tatives of business, industry, and
government visited the campus
either to interview those of the non-
teaching contingent of graduates or
to seek information about the uni-
versity's expanding program and
