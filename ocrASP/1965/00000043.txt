,Boycoti Proposal

The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
is probably the most important and in-
fluential person in the entire civil rights
movement. Since he became nationally

prominent as leader of a 381-day Negro
boycott of buses in Montgomery, Ala-
bama, in 1955 and 1956. which resulted
in a court desegregation order, Dr.
King has been a symbol of the peaceful,
but forceful and effective struggle for
Negro equality.

Dr. King. president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, was
-awarded the, Nobel Peace Prize a few
months ago: this constituted world-wide
recognition of his non-violent tactics.

It is because of the stature of the
man and the influence ‘of his opinion
that we are gravely concerned over
"Dr. - King’s, call fer a national boycott
of Alabama, believing that suchanaction
would be both inadvisable and imprac-
tical.

In an interview on “Meet the Press”
last Sunday, Dr. King stated, “I think
that it is' necessary for the nation to
rise up and engage in a massive eco-
nomic withdrawal program on the state
of» Alabama.”

This- boycott would have two major
goals: to commit Alabama to register
at least fifty percent of its Negroes of
voting age and to insure that the state
would take a vigorous stand against
police brutality.

Both of these goals must, and will be
reached; however, there are better
means than a boycott of Alabama. it
seems to us that Dr. King has neglected
one very important point in calling for
this action; a boycott would probably
harm the Alabama Negro more than any
other element of that state's economic
power structure.

 

Dr. King’s first goal. fifty percent
voting, will be achieved with the im-
plementation of the voting—rights bill.
which, almost undoubtedly. will be passed
in this Congress.

We feel that the boycott could not
bring about any sure guarantee of the
ending of police brutality. Last Monday’s
"New York Times” stated: “It (the
boycott) is also unwise because it in-
jects another element of bitterness and
violence into a situation that is already
impoverished by rancor and hostility."

Last December, Dr. King talked about
a boycott on Mississippi, but he has
never followed that up with any action;
we hope that this will be the case again

Commendahle Ilork

Although the final outcome of the Pro-
visional Council conference held last
week remains to be seen, we have been
most encouraged by the progress and
attitudes displayed so far.

The conference was not by any means
marked by agreement on major issues.
On the contrary there was much heated
debate, but the discussion centered on the
important points at issue, not on petty
differences.

The ability of the council members to
project into the needs of the future is
also highly commendable. This recog-.
nitlon that the University is in a con-
stant state of change, if translated into
a workable constitution, may provide the
student body with a government which
does not have to be completely revised
every seven years.

Finally. we have been greatly pleased
by the form which the government has
taken. Through the commission areas.
representing individual organizations as

' well as interest areas, agreater number
of people will be directly involved in
government than at any time since Albany

Dr: Richard Kendall. in-
structor of History; has a
lot to say about-Student
Association. As former
president and .vice presi-
dent of State’s senate

(1957-1958) he speaks with

insight and frankness about
the problems of student

' government.

In fact, chuckles Kendall, his
committee once wrote aconstitution
"to solve all of the problems of
Senate."

When he wasn't in Senate, Kendall
was serving as Sophomore class
president, member of MYSKANIA
(for two weeks until his own con-
stitution disqualiﬁed him from that
position), SLS brother, and political
columnist for the old “State College
News."

Radical Change Seen

Having seen tne University change
radically in the seven years since
his graduation, Dr. Kendall is
strongly aware of the need for
change in the structure and purpose
of Senate.

That some kind of student gov-
ernment is necessary is obvious,
he feels, but he also adds:

“Such organizations operate best
on a small campus. On larger cam-
puses there is a fragmentation of
energy and a lack of the stability
and homogeneity that lend them-
selves to politicking.

“Ideally, Senators and Sonata

short, you've got to h v .
some kind of system, but not who:
we had when l was here.

Doesn't See Apathy

Kendall denies that apathy exists
at the Albany Campus as far as
Senate is concerned for, he poinls
out, when people are worried about
apathy, apathy doesn’t really exist.
,He gives several reasons for the
seeming indifference of the student
body including:

"it has been said by one French
philosopher, 'The publicprefers to
sleep.’ In that sense, the attitude
here toward student politics is no
different than that of adult SOCleIV
toward politics on a bigger scale.

“The normal functions of a stu-
dent government just don’t affect
people significantly.”

In reaction to the Proviswnul
Council's proposal to include up
to five faculty members appointed
by the President of the University
on Central Council, Kendall felt
that the suggestion was “an inter-
esting idea” that should be “prag-
matically tested."

“I Can't Understand"

Upon learning 'of the Provisionul
Council’s proposal to strip Mis-
KANIA of Judicial power, Kendall
was much more vocal.

He. confessed that he could not
understand the basis for depriving
MYSKANIA of judiciary powers
while at the same- time permitting
it the right to screen candidates {or

eign Relations class.

at. judicial body. '

“In order for any student govern-
insnt to work, it has to have two
things in its favor. 'l-‘iret, peoplq‘
must react positively to it. Second,
it must do something meaningful."

"When i was a student, the thir-
teen Myskie's were by and large
the most outstanding Seniors whom
everyone admired. lf MYSKANIA
consists of 'good' people, it should
fulfill its duties effectively."

‘Ilf disenchantment with MYS-
KANIA is behind this move, per-
maps a more effective move would
be to revise election procedures,
but of course, i don't know the
motives of Provisional Council."

sisting of representatives of all tution as part of the overall Revised Student Government struc-

religious groups on campus rep-
resentation (and a vote) on the
Central Council, Kendall at first
declined to comment on the grounds
that views on religion were too often
misconstrued.

"First, as an Episcopalian, I
agree that religion has a place in
student life since, by definition,
religion has a place in life.

“Second, one must recognize as
a fact that it is oftentrue that the
idea of a university and of religion
are often in conﬂict. One searches
for truth; the other feels thdt the
truth is known.

Religious-Academic Conﬂict

“The degree to which a religious
sect emphasizes that truth is known
and therefore need not be sought is
the catalyst to most religious-aca-
demic conﬂict.

“A good example is the recent
event at Princeton University in
which a Newman Club chaplain and
the president came to odds when
the chaplain criticiwd the "God-
lessness” of the University. This
conflict exists potentially on every
campus.

“However, I think the basic plur-
alism of American society protects
us from real conflicts. In addition,
perhaps giving a voice to the re-
ligious groups will encourage com-
munication between academic and
religious elements.”

As a final comment on Student
Association's proposals, Kendall
upheld the provision raising the
minimum requirements for the Su-
preme Court judges (9 students with
whom the judicial power will be
vested) to a 2.5 accumulative aver-
age (from a 2.0). ,

“It's possible that there is a

young Oliver Wendell Holmes strug-

gling through college with a .8
average, but usually there Is pretty
good correlation between general
intellectual ability and the work
demonstrated in a classroom."

Student Denies Necessity

For Women's Regulations

To the tdltarll

in writing this letter of protest
i should like to refer to part of
President Collins' dialogue during
the debate at the Golden Eye on
March 12. President Collins re-
ferred several timestothesupposed
existence of mutual trust» and re-
spect between the administration
and the student body.

Ironically, his statements brought
to my mind the somewhat archaic
rules at State, requiring women
(girls?) to be in their dorms at
eleven on weekdays and one on
Fridays and Saturdays.

Many educational institutions for
woman allow much later hours, at
least one as late as 6 a.m., and I
would be curious to know whether
or not this has much affect on
student morality or heslth.

I think not, since it in camera
difficult to be immoral prior to
eleven or one than after. The health
problem probably handles itself. A
certain amount of sleep is neces-
sary, and un‘Imltad freedom will
limit itselleventuauy. Other BUIWOiB
seem to have found liso,etsny rate.

As absurd as they are, though,
these rules are only a minor har-
assing factor. A deleterious effect
on morale is caused by the punish-
ment handed down for minor in-
fractions of these, and other, rules
— in short, campusing.

From any reasonable point n!
View, the idea of telling a iwuni)
or twenty-one year-old female that
she must spend one or more cw—
nings in her room, speaking in nu
one but her roommate, and hnmng
only for sanitary sblutiohs, 15pm—
ently, and solidly, asinine. Mom in-
iollipent parents abandon like in ur-
tices very early.

1‘ these rules and iilIspunislnm-ni
are indicative of the trust and I'v-
spect our administrators hold {in
our female students, I find yet
another reason to thank whucvm
ordained that i be born ll Inulr.

Theatre Presents ‘F rome’
pogozever, he made two important   

by Bruce Daniels

Yale's Undergraduate Drama
Festival, conceived nine years ago
by a few enterprising students, has
developed into something like an
annual summit conference for col-
lege drama. Last weekend (March
26, 27 8: 28), twelve colleges —
including Albany -— took part in
this highly selective affair and pre-
sented one-acts 01’ cuttings from
longer plays.

Both the plays and the lively dis-
cussions that followed made the
whole weekend a tremendously en-
joyable and enlightening experience.
One could not help but leave the
Festival without knowing a little
more about one's self, a little more
about the other schools involved and
a lot more about drama.

other colleges participating, be-
sides Albany, were Barnard,Carle-
ton University, Hofstra, C. W. Post,
Queens, Rollins (from Winter Park,
Florida), Smith, Trinity, Wheaten,
Sir George Williams (from Mon-
treal) and Yale.

In addition, several schools sent
non-performinyguest delegations to
watch and comment on the various
productions. Mr. Peter Symcox, a
graduate of Old Vic and professional
judge of festival drama, led the dis-
cussions following each set of three
plays with an occasionally ruthless,
but always charming candor.

Electric Competition

Though no prizes were offered,
the atmosphere of the Festival bris-
iled with competition — but of the
healthy, electric kind that puts both
performance and appreciation on
edge and, hopefully anyway, brings
out the best in everyone.

Albany's entry, after a last-min-
ute shift from "The Tiger" (orig-
inally scheduled to be performed,
but cancelled because of a simul-
taneous commercial production in
New Haven), was "Ethan Frome,"
the University's most recent major
production.

"Ethan," a full-length play that
had to be mercilessly cut down to
size in order to fit the Festival's
time requirements, went off to Yale
without the two performers Iliad
stated in my review to be the
strongest (Mary Temple and Chuck
Heineman), with two-thirds of the
Milt Cavendish Trio, without John
Moore's remarkable set, a greatly
diminished technical crew and a
bare few minutes of chaotic re-
hearsal before performance.

sheed,€ve'.

The play was magnificenti The
audience and Mr. Symcox all agreed
that “Ethan Frome”was excellently
acted and extremely interesting
technically. It was, in my View, the
most ambitious experiment in dra-
matic technique of the whole fes-
tival — and entirely successful.

The stark austerity of the set-
less stage, punctuated only by ﬂash-
ing slides and musical accompani-
ment, is a difficult (but wholly
legitimate) dramatic device to use,
but used well - as it was here —
it is a brilliant and important addi-
tion to the language of the theatre.

Helpless Humanity

Alex Krakower and Norma Gitter
were excellent in their portrayals
of Ethan and Mattie. In the cold
abstract world of the stage and the
play itself, they infused their char-
acters with warm and helpless hu-
manity, seizing our sympathetic at-
tention and holding it throughout.

If this seems to be a reversal of
the negative verdict in "y original
review of "Ethan," ii is for several
important reasons: first, they had
a bad night when [saw the play for
the first time; second, “Ethan
Frome" — as Director Pettit con-
ceives it — is an extremely difficult
and demanding play, even for more

' experienced actors; and third (and

the Festival revealed this much to
me), the quality of acting at Albany
in general is quite a bit higher than
i had suspected.

I think we can expect good, and
possibly great, things from Mr.
Krakower particularly and Miss
Gitter (both first-year students) in
the future — and from State Unl-
versiiy drama as well.

Of course, we must assume that
each of the schools had the same,
or at least comparable, difficulties
in whipping its own play into shape.
The remarkable thing about the
Festival was that it ran so smoothly
and provided such a diverse and
enjoyable program.

Quality Not Unliorm

This is not to say that the plays
wore uniformly good; there was
a fair share of sloppy acting, in-
different direction and bad or in-
appropriate writing (three original
plsys were produced on Saturday
afternoon — of which one was ter-
rible, one good and one superlative-
ly good).

if i were forced to make a scaled
rating of the various plays, 1 should
say that Sir George Williams’ “Wisp

Provisional Comoil members re-
cessed for a shortened springvsce-
tion and resumed work on norm
evening of lest week on their basic
project of revising Student Govern-
ment. " ~

The first three days of the con-*
ference were spent concerned with
Commission areas, and their func-
tion in relation to the total scheme
of SUNY's new concept of student
Government. By Saturday. flight the
roles of the five commission areas
were well defined.

This left the Council with one final
and important step to make. It was
that of outlining the function of the
Central Council in the Government
that is to assume its identity on
May lsi.

Decision Came Sunday

Given the task of stating the duties
and powers of the Central Council,
the Committee on the Central Coun-
cil arrived at their decision by late
Sunday’ afternoon. Their concept was
brought before the entire Provi-
sional Council for are-hash sc. sion
Sunday night, and it was here that a
basic misunderstanding In view-
points became obvious.

It was evident during this meeting
that two essential viewpoints con-
cerning the role of Central Council
existed among the members of Pro-
visional Council.

Clearly defined, each group of—
fered its own Council philosophy,
hoping to bring these views together
to eventually clarify the function of‘
Central Council in its co-ordinating
role with the five commissionareas.

One View conceives of the Centr‘al
Council as a body existing at the
summit of the Government struc-
ture, loosely coordinating all com-
missions, similar to the manner in
which the commission areas co-
ordinate all their member organi-
zations.

Areas Autonomous
Within the framework of this view-
point, the commission areas would

The opposm in; viewpoint evaluates

sensing full powers of coordination
over the member commissions.
_ Provisional Council Chairman
Joseph Mahay interprets the purpose
of Central Council as tintof"efilec-
live coordination with legislation at
a meaningful level." ' "
The cbnfuslon lies in the fact that
by. arriving it the second viewpoint,
the Central Council was, ineffect,
implementing but not clearly stating
specific .powers in their proposal
for the formation of the Council.
Provisional Council's objection
centered around their basic concept
of the Central Council Committee’s
task, which in their opinion was to
incorporate the less powerful view
of Central Council into the total
structure as the philosophy of the
entire Provisional Council.

Strong Philosophy Needed

After the Sunday night meeting,
which occasioned much debate, one
over-riding opinion was evident.
This was the realization that to
carry out. the philosophy of the entire
Government Revision project, it was
necessary to have the stronger View
of the Council's role instituted. This,
along with an intimate incorporation
of Government Revision philosophy
should emerge as the final structure.

The basic Government Revision
viewpoint considers Central Council
to be a body existing to coordinate
the entire University community,
and to promote a successful dialogue
between commission areas.

To bring the opposing views into
line, a new committee has been set
up. It consists of the present Central
Council Committee plus all commis-
sion area chairmen. AI tomorrow's
all-day meeting, this committee will
be called upon to present the com-
bined and revised view of the Coun-
cil's role in Student Government af-
fairs.

Real Talent

These judgments are necessarily

subjective and arbitrary at present,

but I hope to describe my reactions
in further detail in next week's la-
sua of the ASP —- and at the same
time try to draw some inference
about the state of college drama
in the present day.

it is enouin to say, for now, that
Albany should stop wallowing in its
cultural inferiority complex and be-
gin to display and develop the very
real talent it showed us at last
