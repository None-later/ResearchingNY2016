Hoopsters Elect ’65- Captains

by Don Oppedisano

At the recent Winter Sports Ban.
quet held by the Athletic Association,
junior forward Warren Mannix and
sophomore guard Jim Constantino
were elected as co-captains for the
1965-1966 basketball season. Jimmy
is the first sophomore ever to be
elected as captain of one of "Doc"
Sauers’ basketball teams.

Warren, a math major and art
minor, is a resident of Cohoes,
N.Y., where at Cohoes High he
lettered in football and basketball.
When asked how he felt on being
elected as co-captain, Warren was
quoted as saying: “I was really
honored to be elected by my team-
mate’s to handle the many respon-
sibilities of the job of co-captain.
I will have to set 'an example of
overall conduct both on and off the

court."

Jim, a history major with a so-
cial studies minor, hails from Sche-
letterman at Mohonasen High School.
On being elected as co-captain, Jim-
my was quoted as saying: “It was a
great thrill for me to have the
players on the team feel confident
enough to elect me as co-captain."
When asked about next year’s team,
Jimmy said: “We're going to be
young and for the most part inex-
perienced, but we’re not going to
be an easy team to beat."

A RayView of Sports

by Roy McCloat

 

We heard a rumor recently concerning the planning
of two intramural track meets by the AMIA. We admit
,having been a little bit skeptical before spealcmg to
“ advisory consultant” Keith Munsey, cross-country and
frosh baseball coach at State. After all, we reasoned,
how many students would be willing to condition them-
selves for a couple of weeks just to compete in two
meets?

Coach Munsey pointed out, however, thatthe cross-
country team was created out of a similar setup,
whereby several men voluntarily gave up their time to
practice for an unofficial “scrimmage” with neighbor-
ing cross-country teams. The inexperienced barriers
whipped Siena College in their first practice meet,
and lo and behold a cross-country team was organized
at Albany. We would like very much to see a track

in a or also.
teaAs cgﬁh Munsey indicated, however, it is student
interest that creates teams at a college, and the step
taken by the AMIA is cprtainly in the right direction.

The dates have not been established for the runnlng
of the meets, as they are pending possible conflicts
with AMIA softball action (talk about slitting your own

throats! ). Awards will be presented to the winners of
the events which will include both track and field
events.

Competition can also be in club or group form with
the winning team receiving a prize to be awardecfon
a point basis. The team can also enter the numerous
relay events that will be run.

Heading the committee on organizing the track meet
is Gary Moore. He is being assisted by barriers Tom
Robinson and Ken Dormer, both of whom will lend
valuable experience in running the track meets.

The trouble with the whole setup is paintfully ob-
vious: its success depends on student support. As a
result, we cannot predict the achievements the meets
might accomplish - we can only hope.

OVER 500 MARCHERS assombl

girl the budget-cut protest. After this picture was taken large
groups of students continued to join in an orderly fashion.

Council Devises Action

Against Proposed Slice

Over five hundred stu-
dents marched in protest
to the Capitol yesterday
against the proposed budget
cut in the State University
budget. The demonstration
began as an independent
project and was later on—
dorsed by the Provisional
Council.

It began in front of Draper flail at
ll:45 a.m. andproceeded down Wes—
tern Avenue io tile Capitol where
the marchers circled the building
and marched back to the University
campus.

Tile march was a culmination of
events which began at anemergellcy
meeting of the Provisional Council
called by Chairman Joe Mallay
Thursday night. At the meeting a
committee was created to formu-
late action against the proposed 0.8
million cut.

Committee Members

The committee was composed of
llill'Dld Lynne, chairman, Joe Ma-
hay, Steve Curii, Marjory Pasko,
and Dick Thompson. Soon after their
formation they decided on the course
of action to be taken.

The committee decided that their
protests lo the legislature would not
be effective because most students
were not eligible to vote. They do-
cldcd instead that the student body
should call home illltl link their
legislator illlil voice their protest
llglllllsi the cut ill the budget.

To encourage the student body
to do this, (i500 information sheets
were distributed Friday. The sheets
oriented the students with the prob-
lom and explained the course of
action that was being taken by the
Council.

lll addition speeches were made
in “listed Cafeteria by Mnhuy. lie
told what areas the cut would effect
ill the University and how lilo filli-
dollt would be affected.

Newspaper Coverage

Lynne worked 'l‘hursday typing up
press releases for the newspaper
which he distributed to tile news-
papers, AP, and um at the Capitol
Friday morning.

in addition he and several other
members of the committee were
interviewed by the "Times Union."

  

 

APRIL ‘6. 1965

The State University of
New York at Albany faces a
budget cut of $221,000 if
the Legislature votes
through a reduced budget
for the fiscalyear 1965—66.
Albany’s cut is the resultof
a Legislative proposal to
cut the entire State Univer-
sity budget by $6.8 million.

it will be up to the officials of
Albany to determine where the sav-
ings Would have to be lnade if the
$221,000 is taken away.

President Evan R. Collins pointed
out that the places where savings
can be made are limited. Mainten-

 

Pholo by Scbmilzcr
ed in front of Draper Hall to be-

ample, are virtually fixed.

The most readily reducible cate-
gory would be that of faculty addi-
tions. If the entire saving was made
n this category, it would mean that
25-30 full-iillleinstruciors could not
be hired. These instructors would
be needed for the increased student
enrolllllellt next fall.

In the interview they stated their
reasons for the march and ex-
plained how the University was going
to be affected.

Besides reaching the local press,
stories appeared in newspapers
across the State.

No Dilution
Dr. Collins has stated that he
“will not permit the educational
effectiveness of the university to
be diluted by trying to serve larger

flclent faculty." This is also the
position taken by President Samuel
B. Gould in regard to the entire
State University.

If the savings cannot be made lll
other places, therefore, the only
alternative would be to reduce the

Lynne Appears on TV

After informing the newspapers of
the students’ action Lynne traveled
to the studios of WTEN. In a two
minute interview be appealed to the
public to pressure their Assembly—
lllen and Senators to vote down the
budget cut.

After the march Lynne appeared
on the floor of the Assembly ex-
plaining how the cut would cripple
Albany and the State University sys-
teln as a whole. (excerpts of his‘
speech can be found on page 2.)

Faculty reaction has been sym-
pathetic to the students’ protest.
Many members took part in yester-
day’s march and others allowed stu-
dents to cut their classes to attend
the protest.

Dr. Evan Collins, president ofthe
University, indicated in an interview
on WSUA Sunday night that he would
allow the faculty to decide if they
wanted to cancel their classes.

some freshmen who have already
received formal acceptance to the
University.

Scholarship Reduction

reduction will be directly fell by
the students is ill the State Univer-
sity Scholarships. These scholar-
ships provide up to $200 per yeai

Under the proposed Legislative

Dr. Kenneth T.~Doran, President
of the Alumni Assooiation, spoke
“on behalf 'of our more than 12,000
living alumni" stating that “without
these funds, the State University at
Albany may be forced to default on
its commitment to provide anoppor-
tunlty for post-secondary education
of hundreds of well-qualified young
men and women of this State.

in addition, a letter was sent to
each alumnus explaining the situa-
tion and urging each to contact his
representatives in the Legislature.

Truman D. Cameron, Cllalrman of
the University Council, urged
"strong support for restoration of
these critically needed funds. Any
such major reduction in financial
support is a denial of the long-ac-
cepted responsibility of our State to
provide for the higher education of

our most promising young men and

women."

Tile faculty and the student body
began to take action of their own on
Thursday. (See story this page.)
