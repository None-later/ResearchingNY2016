a number of pianistic qualities com-
monly associated with youth; ex-

uberance, fine technique, energy
and propulsiveness, and great
stamina.

But Entremont has also matured
a lot since the last time this reviewer
heard him. He seems to have learned
how to shape a phrase and how to
hold a piece together. Thus, while
the characteristics that Thad always
associated with him were clearly in
evidence, it was particularly satis-
fying to notice that it was the slow
movements of the program that were
"in most beautiful.

Student Lauds Action
Taken on Budget Cut

To the Editors:

The action taken by the student
government protesting the proposed
State Budget cut is highly commend-
able. The members of Provisional
and Central Councils and the mem-
bers of MYSKANIA are to be con-
gratulated on taking a stand against
such ridiculous measures.

The student body, by and large,
backs the decisions of student gov-
ernment. However, the students
themselves must provide the re-
sponse by carrying out the sug-
gested measures of contacting State
Senators and Assemblymen.

As with the present situation, it
is hoped that in the future, Student
government will initiate similar
proposals when deemed necessary.
It is only through a united effort of
the Student Association led by the
Student Government, that dozingpoi-
iticians may be awakened to the
aslninity of some oftheir legislation.

Rich Ten Eyck

The Bach "Partita No. l in IS-
Vlat” has the typical animation and
internal dynamism of Bach that made
it a good opener for the soloist.

The Mozart sonata in G, K. 283
provided some of the best moments

. of the evening. The second move-

ment was beautifully phrased and
wall thought out, while the last
movement with those dramatic oc-
tave leaps was breathtaking.

One would think that the music
of Schumann would be particularly
suited to Entremont's style, and
indeed the individual sections of
the “Etudes Symphonique” were
nicely done. But the overall im-
pression was that there was fun
much similarity as a whole. When
the performer gets a little more
subtlety into the dynamic markings
of these works, his performance of
them will be something to hear.

This did not prove to be the case
with the suite "Pour le Piano” by
Debussy. Entremont has had a rep-
utation as an interpreter of Debus-
sy, although one could wonder about
his loss limpid, more vibrant ap-
proaches to the music when l heard
it before.

For this music, however, the ap—
proach was just right, with the ser-
ond section providing the evening's
high spot. The rich inner SullOi‘ltlcs
Were brought out to besteffect here.

The Prokofiev Second sunatu is n
typical work of this composer --
technically demanding, phenol and
ironic in spots, yet well construr-md
and charming.

There might have been a litllu
more piquancy for this music, (-5-
pecially in the Scherzo—Trio, but iln-
overall drive at his cmnmzmd mqu
one marvel at the fact that he was
able to perform such a (lelililildllll',
piece after such a strenous program.

“in the south you can see the fear

Fayette Gurney, member of the Ex-
ecutive Committee of SNCC, speak-
ing to students in, Page Hall.

Mr. surney was the guest speaker
of the University Freedom Council.
The UFC donated $160 to the Student
Non-Violet Coordinating Committee
for the privilege of having Mr. sur-
nay as a speaker. He wasintroduced
to the audience by Lou Strong, Pres-

School Tournament

On the 19th and 20th of March,
the Speech Department and the De—
bate COuncil were host for the an—
nual Regional High School Forensic
Debate Tournament. Over 100 stu-
dents, representing 15 schools in
this area, competed in formal de-
bate, oral and dramatic interpreta-
tion. and extempgraneous speaking.

The winners of the tournament re-
turned to Albany thislast weekend to
compete in the state finals.

At the state finals, 487 high school
students competed for honors in-
cluding trophies and an opportunity
to participate in the National Debate
Contest at Omaha, Neb. this sum—
19F.

This was the last year that Al-
bany State hosted tournaments of
this kind until the new campus is
completed. Debates of this sort
afford students and teachers of this
campus ample opportunity to view
perfected high school public speak-
ers, but must be curtailed due to
lack of space.

Uther Debate Council activities
for the remainder of the academic
year include a demonstration debate
to be held at a local synagogue and
participation in the New York State
Intercollegiate Legislative Assem-
bly.

iii-tireless ,
.s TCiv’il'IliQIIts History

Mr. Surney’s speech dealtwlthths '

functions, of SNCC and his personal
observations as Negro living in the
South. He began his lecture with a
joke about Governor Wallace and
continued with a history of SNCC.

He told how SNCC began when in
Greensboro, N.C., on Feb. 1, 1900,
at 10 8.111. a Negro student was ar-
rested for sitting at a Woolworth
lunch-counter. By 2 p.m. over two-
liundred students had been put in
jail and the foundations for SNCC
has been formed.

He continued to explain the role
of SNCC in the voter registration
going on now in the South.

Political Power

“The civil rights struggle is now
a question of political power." lie
believes that the only way to achieve
this power is for the Negro to be
willing “to suffer for non-violence.”

Mr. Surney said that SNCC is
pleased with the good intentions of
the government in passing civil
rights legislation, but said that
"Bills do no good unless enforced.”
He felt that these civil rights bills
would not be necessary if the Four-
teenth Amendment were properly
enforced.

Personal anecdotes were a high-
light of Mr. Surney’s speech. He
told of the days when he was a
child in the South. “When I was
young and saw a white woman walk
down the street, I turned my head
in fear.”

Hate a Qualification

He also commented on the police-
force of Sheriff Clark in Selma.
"To be a policeman in the South,
especially during demonstration
time, all you have to know is how
to shoot a gun and hate niggers.”

Looking to the future Mr. Surney
predicted, “The right to vote will
determine whether the Negro lives
or dies.” He then urged students
to help the Negro obtain their rights
by, “making your College exper-
ience more than one uijst formal
learning.”

nglish Prof Publishes Donne Volume;
Second Study Done in Forty Years

Edward LeComie, Professor of
English, has recently joined the
small circle of State profs whohave
published a book thisyear. His book,
“Grace to a \Vltty Sinner,” is a
biography of the famed Engliin poet,
John Donne.

LeComfe discusses the earlier
phases of Donne's life: Donne’s
Roman Catholic heritage and up-
bringing and what effects on his
later life it had.

Donne was educated at the Uni-
Versiiies of Oxford and Cambridge.
He spent much of his time at the
Inns of Court, a law school, busi-
ness school and fashionable club
for sons of well-to-do families.

After his education he trai’eled
throughout Europe as secretary to
Sir Thomas Egerton, Lord Keeper
of England.

During these years he was de-
pendent on his family for income
to continue his travels and to write
of his experiences.

"Anniversaries"

In 1011 he published the long
“Anniversaries.” This wasaseries
of his meditations on corruption
and perfection, ignorance and knowl-
edge, death and immorality.

He was ordained in 1615 and soon
achieved fame as apowerful preach-
er, at Lincoln’s lnn, St. Paul’s and
at court.

The book was published by Walker

and Company and was released on
the market in January. Two days
later the New York Times Book Re-
view called LeComte’s work a
“highly colored story, with all its
outward contradictions and inward
consistency, is presented with un-
derstanding and skill.

First Biography in 40 Years

LeComte’s biography of Donne is
only the second one to be published
in the last forty years. He uses
Donne's public writings and letters
in presenting the life of the con-
troversial poet.

The Review calls says that “Le-
Comte does more than many semi-
biographers do to acquaint the read-
ers with the matter and manner, the
attitudes and ideas, of his subject.
These discussions of the poet and
divine are tactfully woven into the
narrative, and even readers intent
solely on “human interest” would
not find them dull.”
