to load supplies.

"They all disappeared, and when
it came time for the boat to leave.

recalls. “Then, down the road came

Her African trip did brings few

Dr. Stewart, dangerous snakes were
not as much oi a problem in the

were in the cleared areas around

"A. S. Neill founded Summerhiil
in 1921 in‘ Suifold, England. This
.unique school, and it really is unique,
is built on the principle of freedom,
with healthy portions of love and
Freud mixed in.

‘ in his book", “Summerhiil: A Rad:
ical Approach to Child Rearing,"
Neill describes the philosophy, set-

up and hopeful future of his edu--

cation'experiment.

To describe Summerhill’s sys-
tem is relatively easy but to decide
whether the merits outweigh the
faults is a complex problem. Neill
believes in the' inherent goodness of
the child. The ultimate goal of life,
and therefore education, is Happi-
ness. whether this is found in a

 

 

garden or a poolroom.

Classes at Summerhiil are offered. '

offered at Summerhiil because Neill
feels that religion would hamper
the freedom of the child. There are
no restrictions on social activities
at Summerhiil, in fact Neill almost
seems to encourage masturbation
as being helpful to the child’s sexual
adjustment.

Neill says that he has found that
students wishing to gain further ed-
ucation by entering the University
find it no burden to study for a year
and soon be able to pass the entrance
examinations. Despite the uncon-
ventional methods employed, Sum-
merhiil produces "solid" citizens.
Although Neill claims no genuises,
he does feel that Summerhiil grad-
uates are happy, satisfied people.

Stimulating and Frightening

it is disquieting for the reader to
have Neill scoff at many ofour basic
educational norms. Yes, the book is
thought-provoking, stimulating, but
it is also somewhat frightening to
see our educational systems knocked
so thoroughly.

One emerges from the book still
satisfied that prevalent educational
methods are superior to the anti-
intellectual education Neill ls offer-
ing.

. First Production

The first production will be a comedy-mystery en—
titled “Trap for a Lonely Man” by Robert Thomas. The
author, a Frenchman. has received two-fold recognition
for his talents: in 1961 the play won the annual award
given by the French Surete to the best mystery of the
year: soon after it was bought for the screen by that
master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock. The Spanish
version was prepared by Jose Luis Alonso, the dis—
tinguished director of Madrid’s NutionalTheatei‘“Tea-
tro Nacional Maria Guerrero.”

Star of “Trilp for a Lonely Man" (called in Spanish
“Trampa para un Hombre Solo”) is Maruja Mas, dy-
namic actress from Madrid. well-known in her native
Spain as well as in Puerto Rico.

Ticket Inlormation

Opening date was March 26. The play will be pre-
sented Tuesday through Sunday at 8:30, with matinee on
Saturdays and Sundays. There will be a uniform charge
of $2.50 for all seats. Tickets are obtainable by mail
from Pauline Despois, 1125 Lexington Avenue, New

Warren Show Al Albany Institute
Reveals Many Facets of Artist

by Robert Day, 77mm" I’M/on

Artist Betty Warren, in her new
exhibit at the Albany Institute off-lis-
tory and Art, is seen to be apaiuter
of many facets.

On the one hand, Miss Warren can
be viewed as a society portraitist,
represented in this show by por-
traits that are polished, profes-
sional, and even distingushed.
These portraits of prominent men
of affairs or of sleek and cooly corn-
posed young women are flatteringto
their subjecls. Not one of the un-
blemished personages seems to have
echoed Oliver Cromwell’s instruc-
tions to his portraitist, “Paint me
as I am, warts and all.”

On the other hand, Miss Warren
depicts the destitute with obvious
warmth and compassion.

Sympathy for Unlortunolc

ller sympathy for the unfortunate
among us is reflected, not only in
her tenderly wrought drawings for
“The Times-Union Needy Fund" lhe
past several Christmas seasons, but
also in numerous other studies of
women and children in sorrow or

also a remarkably voluptuous re-
clining nude, and several erect un-
clad sadies of somewhat less erotic

intelligent, her mouth firm. Her
hand holding the paintbrush is, on

 
  
 
  

 

 

demeanor.

The French influence is strong in
a brightly-colored and dappled study
of a mother and son, “0n the Beach.”
And Miss Warren harks back to the
Flemish masters in the Renaissance
with her thoughtful treatment of light
and shadow in such still lifes as
“Blue Bottle and Copper Pot." And
she is affectionate and even poignant
in her paintings of cheerful children
and adolescent girls.

The Artist Herscll
“Self-Portrait in Straw Hat“ tells
little of the artist liqrself. Miss
Warren appears as invincible, nus-
tere, and self-possessed as the
handsome subjects in her society
portraits. Her eyes are steady and

closer inspection, eminently. auth--
‘oritaiive.

Front Rank

Miss Warren has indeed attained
front rank amongCapltaland artists.

Looking over her new one-woman
show at the Institute, one is hardput
to categorize Betty Warren. Com-
plimentary society portraits vie for
attention with faces of human deso-
lation, of lush body-worship, of
innocent childhood, and of simple
mother love.

As we were permitted to quote
Oliver Cromwell earlier, perhaps
we can attempt to sum up Miss
Warren by quoting one of Crom-
well’s contemporaries, the poet John
Donne. lie spoke of being "involved
in mankind.“

Norrotlvo Fiction on Stage
Chamber Theatre is a technique
for presenting nnrrullve fiction on
the stage, taking full advantage of
the theatric devices offered by the
stage without sacrificing the nor-
rntive elements of lilernture.

The originator of Chamber Thea-
' ire is Dr. Robert Brien of North-
western University. ’l‘hisproduclion
will be direcled by Mr. Ross Stephen
of the Speech Department.

in fiction the narrative element
helps'guide the render to the point
of View. Chamber Theatre, however,
gives the narration aphysical em-
bodiment so that he, the narrator,

Narrative fiction and the drama
share, on the mostparl,plot, action,
and dialogue. There are, however,
two important differences? slmul-’
taneity (which drama has) and ex-.
plorotion of motivation at the mo-
ment of action (which narrative
fiction has).

The serial nature of language
denies simultanein on the printed
page; in drama we see, the action
and hear the language simultaneous-

Iv.

But unless the action ofthe drama
is suspended we cannot explore the
motivation for the action as it oc-
curs.

Motivation

Chamber Theatre is interested in
helping the narrative fiction achieve
.some elements of the drama such
as simultaneity, yet by means ofthe
narrative element, also showthe ex-
plorniion of motivation within the
characters' minds without always
the need for suspended action.

Chamber Theatre in its critical
interest dramatizes the style: by
means of a narrator it gives tile
style a body, a character.

English-Speech Evening is sponw
sored jointly by the Departments of
ﬁngiish and of Speech and Dramatic
