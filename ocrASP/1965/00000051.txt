A look into Sports History

by Ray McCloot

On April 8, 1927, a chess club
,was organized at Albany State under
the direction of Professor C. A.
Woodward, head of the biology'de-
partment.

On April 9, 1937, sharpshooters
John DeNeef and Vincent Quinn tied
for first place in a foul shooting
contest, sinking 18 of 25.

During this past week fifteen years
ago the women of MYSKANIA
clinched the WAA basketball cham-
pionship by defeating the hoopsters
of Phi Delta, 36-7.

On April 9, 1959, the tennis team

finally. made the grade as its sﬁt'us'

was changed from a club position
to varsity level.
Over the'Spring Recess of 1961

‘ if golf coach "Doc" Sauers is to

other leading candidates are top

The big matches this year will
be against ll.P.l., one point victor

who tied State in 1964.

Two Programs on Soviet Union

Two programs on the
Soviet Union will be pre-
sented by Forum of Pol-
itics tonight and Wednes-
day. April 28. The topics
of the programs are the
“Soviet Conception of the
United Nations,” and “Are
Soviet Technocrats Taking
over Russia?”

Cornelittoe Begins
Writilg Constitution

The final' report oi the Central
Council committee was approved
and sent to a drafting committee by
Provisional Council at its meeting
Saturday morning. Also 5th to the
drafting committee were the con-
stitutions of the five commission
areas.

The drafting committee will co-
ordinate the reports and write a
final constitution for tile government
to be instituted in May. This con-
stitution will have to be approved
by Provisional Council, and then will
be submitted to the student body for
ratification.

Tile Central Committee report
represented the result of on extoll-
sive amount of work in reconciling
the viewpoints of differellt members
of the Council. Strong objections
were raised to the first proposal for
Central Council because it contained
no provision for Commission areas
to appeal decisions oi the Council.

Under the final propoeai, tile com-
mission arens retain relative auto-
nomy in dealing with lllutters per-
taining directly to their urea of
interest. The Council retains the
power to reject lilo actions of any
cornlllisslon area, but the commis-
sions will be able to appeal deci-
sions to u Sunrelne Court.

Recognises SCOPE

Provisional Council also gave of-
ficial recognition to the SCOPE unit
which is now soliciting funds and
recruiting members for a voter
re istratlon drive in the South.

' No vote for recognition was pre-
ceded by a discussion of student
government's responsibilities inal-
iowing organizations representing a
specific political viewpoint to ad-
vocate their views on campus.

Louis Halasz, acorrespondent for
the United Nations, will discuss the

the United Nations tonight in Bru-
bacher, Room 5 at 8 p.m. He will
speak in view oi the Soviet Union's
recent failure to pay her UN dues.

Halasz is a native of Hungary,
where he received his doctorate in
economics.and law from the De-
brecen University in Budapest.
While living in Hungary,ho violently
opposed the extension of Comm’un-
ism to Hungary.

Forced to Flee

Because of his adamant stand he
was forced to flee ills homeland in
1946 to escape Soviet harassment.
In 1951, he came to the United
States and shortly afterward be-
came a reporter for Radio Free
Europe.

In 1955 he was assigned to cover,
the United Nations until 1960, when
he received a post in the Office of
Public Information of the United
Nations.

in 1962 he resigned and continued
his reporting of the United Nations
for tile international Feature Serv-
ice.

liis active role in covering the
United Nations had made him well-
quaiified to discuss the world or-
ganization and the different posi-
tions. hold by the West and the
East in world politics.

Gary Luczak, station manager of
WSUA, contended that the four or-

salaried, merited this because of
tile work involved and the unique-

Bader answered that be felt this
was not work as in tile category of
