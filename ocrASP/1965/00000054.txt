The Quebec-Washington-Guan-

'tanamo Walk for Peace was orig-

inally a call for better relations
between the United States and Cuba,

ondar'y issues came to dominate the
walk’s public imago. Among these
issues were those of peaceable pub-
lic assembly, free speech, police
excesses, and freedom oi travel.

Cattle Prods

in Albany; Georgia, the marchers
were beaten and shocked with elec-
tric cattle prods by police.

On October 2'1, 1964, after ex-
hausting every legal means oi ob.-
talning permission to sail to Cuba
from Miami, a group oi five walk-
ers started the trip in a small
boat, the "Spirit oi Freedom."

Within an hour the boat was seized
by the U. 5. Coast Guard. Action
filed by the government in Federal
District Court in Miami in legally
complete confiscation of the boat has
been officially titled the "United
States oi America Vs. the Spirit of
Freedom.”

title role, and features Mercedes
Mercambrldge, John Derek andJohn
lreland.

Crawford and Mercambridge both
won academy awards for their por-
trayals in this film, while dire‘ctor
Rossen, who later made "Lilith"
and “The Hustler," received an
award for best production.

“Throne oi Blood" is a samurai
drama directed by Akira Kurosawa,
the outstanding director who made
“The Magnificent Seven," “Yoltm-
be," and "High and Low."

“Throne oi Blood,” is an unusual
treatment of a familiar theme,being
directly wbased on Shakespeare's
“Macbeth.” in this modern drama,
Shakespeare's tortured villain is a
powerful warlord during Japan's
Senguchi civil wars.

Starring Toshiro Miiune, who also
starred in "The Magnificent Seven”
and “Yojimbo,” the film has been
widely praised not only as a most
successful realization of the Shakes-
pearian drama on the screen, but is
highly regarded as a fast moving
film of its own right.

Admission to this outstanding fea-
ture will be fifty cents, while the
admission charge for “All the King’s
Men” will be thirty-five cents.

The IFG regrets that “Psycho,”
which was to have been shown next
weekend, has been cancelled by the
distributors. We regret that we will
not be able to show this film next
Friday evening.

One of several proposals to add

these groups as well as from the
student body. SCOPE members at

tinue to solicit funds and distribute
information.

More SCOPE buttons, to be sold
at twenty-five cents each, have been
ordered.

 

Publish News Letter

In addition to these projects, the
SCOPE publicity committee intends
to publish a news letter which will
be paid for by advertising solicited
from local businessmen.

Anyone who is interestedin work-
ing on this news letter or any other
phase of the SCOPE project should
contact 3 SCOPE representative at
the SCOPE desk in the Peristyles.

The fund raising committee will
soon begin to solicit for additional
funds from faculty members.

Jenny Freyone, Chairman of the
Albany State SCOPE project com-
mittee, said that 3 SCOPE com-
mittee is now being organized at
Union College. The new committee
will work with the Albany State
group.
