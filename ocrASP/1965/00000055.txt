Honors convocation. Significant

- The Honors Convocation scheduled for

this ‘Sunday afternoon is, to our way of

thinking, one of the most significant
steps taken this year to help make Al-
bany truly a University.

Scholastic excellence is one of the
basic goals of a college education, yet
those who do achieve it have gone large-
ly unrecognized on this campus. Inau-
guration ceremonies for student govern-
ment officers, athletic awards banquets,
and until last year Moving Up Day cere-
monies have long been part of our tra-
ditions' honoring those who have made
significant Contributions to the school
in extra-curricular activities.

Those your have contributed to the
school in curricular activities deserve
just as great recognition and praise
from the student body. Their achieve—

ments not only bring honor upon them-
sevles, but also help to establish Al-‘
bany's reputation as an institution striv-
ing for academic excellence.

The Convocation has been planned for
several years, and this year is a reality
through the efforts of a hard-working
group of faculty and students. The pro-
gram has been well-planned, and should
afford an excellent opportunity for the
student body to see assembled the aca-
demic talent of which this University
can well boast.

The Convocation will also provide an
opportunity for the student body to dem-
onstrate that it is vitally interested in

having academic excellence recognized

and rewarded.
We hope to see Page Hall filled on
Sunday afternoon.

Proposed Government Promising

The proposed structure for the new
student government, explained on these
pages, is the result of almost three
years of - work and thought by a great
number of people. It represents the
analysis and combination of many phil-
osophies and many ideas, and it offers
a truly comprehensive plan for a work-
able and effective student government
at Albany.

Recognizing that most governmental
matters will deal with specific organi-
zations on campus, the government has
provided for having this legislation im-
plemented by commission areas, which
represent individual organizations hav-
ing common interests and common prob-
lems.

Through commission representation
on the Central Council,organizations for
the first time have a voice in matters
which affect them directly, particularly

in fiscal matters. At the same time,
provisions for a Supreme Court and for
directly elected representatives on the
Central Council safeguard against the
domination of the government by a special
interest group.

One of the most encouraging features
of the new government is the amount of

' people it can potentially involve in the
- government. With the University at its

top enrollment of 10,000, the Central
Council itself will have about 35 mem-
bers.

However, it is at the top of a struc-
ture which includes commissions and
further subdivisions into boards and
special courts. All of these structural
units will involve many students direct-
ly in the process of government. It will
be quite difficult for the complaint ever
again to arise that the government rests
in the hands of a few students.

Provisional Council Chairmen r

To, explain the diagram
at the‘right it is necessary
to explain the philosophy
and constitution involved
in the proposed new gov-

ernment.

The Central Council is a body
possessing supreme executive and
legislative povers. These powers,
as clearly stated 'in the preamble,
are to be delegated to five com-
mission areas. The commissions
deal with the problems peculiar to
living affairs, communications,
qommiulity programming, academic
affairs, and religious affairs.

Central Council in the last meas-
ure must have on call all legislative
and executive powers as a body
representative of all student inter-
ests, faculty, and the students them-
selves as opposed to the commis-
sion areas which represent only
special interests. .

Council Representation

The representatiori on Central
Council Is as such: five faculty
members appointed by the presi-
dent oi the University (this is the
first time faculty have participa
with voting powers in a student
government on this campus), rep-
resentatives from the commission
areas and from the general student
body in a ratio of three to five
respectively. This ratio is to the
nearest whole number making the.
first Central Council consist of
about eleven members elected at
large from certain areas of the
campus.

it is hoped that by requiring a
candidate to run from a certain
area such as a dorm that he will
have a closer relationship with the
people he represents. The repre-
sentation from the commission

 

orees'will always be equal for all
areas. The first Council will have
two representatives from each com.
mission. ‘

Council Officers

The Vofficers of Central Council
shall be elected from its member.
ship by a two-thirds vote. The of.
floors are a president and vice
president with a secretary-tress-
urer added from the outside. Im-
peachrnent of officers and members
may be‘ instituted by written petition
of one-fourth of their constituent
members.

Rules of impeachment shall not
apply to members of MYSKANIA.

The duties and powers of Central
Council are to enforce all laws in
the Constitution, and to make all
laws necessary for its operation.
Those are the legislative powers
of Central Council.

Establishes Policy

It is further empowered to de-
termine student tax, to establish
general financial policy, to allo-
cate funds, and to have ultimate
power of audit and control of stu-
dent finances. Central Council is
also responsible for students and
student conduct in and about the
university.

To effectively coordinate the com-
mission areas Central Council shall
have the power to review any and all
policies and procedures of subsid-
iary bodies; it shall have the power
to reject any policies or procedures
which it deems inconsistent with the
best interests of the student body.

To provide for adialogue among
the students, the faculty, and the
broader community as well the Cell-
tral shall have the power to provide
for effective means of communica-
tion.

To provide for expansion of the
government, Central Council shall
be empowered to grant organiza-
tional recognition in final appeal.

Finally, Central Council shall

 

have the. to provide for proper

Five Commissions ; 4
Under the Central Council in thi

structure its five commission
areas: Living Area, Communica-
tions, Community: Programming,
Academic~'Affsirs, and Religious
Affairs. ' ' .

Central Council, as stated in the
introduction to the statement of its
duties and Powers, will delegate its
legislative powers to the commis-
sion areas to allow them to operate
with ' avceriain autonomy in the
areas of their concern.

it is felt that, the commission
areas being composed of repre-
sentatives with a knowledge of their
area will be able to govern their
areas with the most ability. This
provides for the concept of legis-
lation at meaningful levels.

These commission areas will
handle the bulk of the legislative and
executive process of the new student
government. This will leave Central
Council free to concern itself with
business of general university con-
cern such as' student-faculty rela-

MYSKANIA Finds Rel-ew-Change Necessary,
Shifts from Judicial to Honorary Function

by Al Smith
Chairman of MYSKANIA

MYSKANIA, as well as the other
branches of the student association
government, is in an era of transition
and complete change. Again, as in
1921, 1946 and 1958, MYSKANIA
finds it necessary to change its role
in order to keep abreast of the con-
ditions and needs of the University
and in order to fulfill the basic pur-
poses for which it was established
on April 13. 1917.

These basic purposes fire 1. To
unite the student body, 2. To moti-
vate extra-curricular activities, 3.
To uphold college traditions, and 4.
To act as a medlary between the
faculty and the students.

Upon the passage of the proposed
constitution for a commission struc-
tured government, MYSKANIA will
relinquish its judicial powers and
assume the role as the highest non-
academic honorary recognizing
those members of the Junior class
who have made outstanding con-
tributions to the University.

Active Involvement

The duties and functions of MYS-
KANlA as an honorary actively iii-
voived in student life will be 1. To
act as guardians of traditions in
evaluating and providing for con-
tinuity of meaningful traditions and
traditional events on campus.

2

To act as guardians of the 

Freshman class.

3. To participate in the orienta-
tion of new students.

4. To act as screening agent for
the appointments to the Supreme
Court and to act in concert with
Central Council in providing for
Judiciary recall.

5'. To assist the Student Associa-
tion and the university iii formulating
the aims and objectives of the uni-
versity and to interpret these aims
and objectives to the studentvbody
until to the broader community as
we .

6. To assist the student assurin-
tion and the university in the evalu-
ation of rules and regulations pui-
taining to the students and to refer
suggestions regarding these rules
and regulations to the appropriate
bodies.

'7. To act in concert with the Slu-
dent Association and the UniVei-siiy
in contemplating the future needs of

the. student body and the Univarsny.

community.

8. To serve upon request in an
advisory capacity to groups, or-
ganizations and individual persons
on campus.

  

TﬂE 1965.66 MYSKANIA stand according to their seating arrangement.

Row: Pep Pesiilo, Maria Tucci.

don. Bock Row: Udo Gdddat. Bill Laundry, Vera Komonowsiil,

and Bill Bate.

9. To recognize leadership po-
tential. —.

The basic reason for MYSKANIA’s
change Is that each year under the
past and current governmental sys-
tems, the members of MYSKANlA,
who are considered to be the top
thirteen studelit leaders, are taken
from their respective sphere of in-
ﬂuence and are placed in a judicial
position serving as judges.

Judicial Position Limited
Although this positionis extreme-
ly important, it nevertheless limits
to a sat extent, by virtue of sep-

 
 

aration of powers, the potential cori-
trihutions and services of the mem-
bers of MYSKANIA to the Student
Association and to the broader com-
munity as well.

Under this newly expanded con-
cept, MYSKANIA Will have the free-
dom and opportunity to fulfill Its
Ideals. The membersofMYSKANlA,
as in the past, will be elected from
the second semester Junior class
by the Student Association and serve
in active membership for a period
of one year. All other traditional
aspects of MYSKANIA will remain
the same.

Students Support Salaries

For ‘Outer-Direcied'Media

To the Editors:

The Albany Student Press, WSUA,
and the Torch are outer-directed;
they represent the State University
of New York at Albany to the public.
These are also our mass media,
serving the student body in a time
in which communication within the
University plays a vital and in-
creasingly central role.

The nature of the effort required
to make these the best possible
media is one which demands more
energy and dedication than any other
activity on campus (with the possible
exception of heading Student Govern-
meni.)

it is not our Intention to state
that the quality of these communi-
cations depends upon iiic salaried
devotion of their directors. But
these few students must, by the very
nature of the job they are doing,
serve the whole University.

if we, as a body, can give them
an even greater Incentive illnn"lov-
ing the work,” Isn't this, ultimate-
ly, a service to ourselves?

There will, no doubt, always be a
newspaper editor, a yearbook editor,
mill soiiieune to bundle the radio
station. The student body must real-
Izc lliiil these are more than just
nnolhcr activity to join. These
media, and those students wilurnnlre
them possible, offer for more to us
than we ever could to them.

The idea of giving a salary to the
directors of these coiniilunlcatimis
is :1 result of the natureofihoiicilv-
Iiics themselves. Not all cmnpus
organizations serve the University
In such an obviously significant way;
just as obviously, other campus or—
ganizations merit no sniui'leii recog-
nition by the students of the whole
University.

Ilow many instances, for example,
have there been of club officers
demanding salaries for their Work?
Does the Finance Committee know
the reply to the hypothetical ques-
tion? 0r haven't they needed a re-
ply? Aciuaily, the question is itself

absurd because the principle that
"if one organization receives a
salary the other activities would
request one" is a complete fallacy.

If, as the editorial of April 13,
and the letter of Steve Curti report,
the minds of the committee were
closed, if there were pro-judg-
ments for some mystical, unknown
reason, we urge the members of
Finance Committee to consider the
impact of their decision. We urge
the Provisional Council to reverse
that decision.

For the four years that we have
attended this institution, student
government has constantly been in
the midst of crisis, change, and in-
decision. What has been the most
appalling feature is the distribution
of thousands of dollars resting In
the hands of a small minority of
students.

At tilts moment, that minority
consists of fIVe students. The bi‘ight
future of top-quality mass media
at this University is dimmed some-
what by tiie thought that no more
than a handful are making the de-
cisions.

if the committee believes that
it has student support let them
test the belief with a student ref-
erendum.

Honors Convocation Needs
Support of Student Body

To the Editors:

In lhc that analysis, a University
is judged by Its standards of schol-
arship and by the calibre of its
graduates. At this University we
have reason to be proud of both.
in the past perhaps one of the
reasons we have not been proud is
that there this been no recognition
of those who achieved honors.

There is no longer any reason
why students at this University
should maintain their self-iiiiposed
bridge of second-class citizenship
in the academic world.

On Sunday, April 25 at 3 p,ni.
the Faculty Conlmiiiee on Student
Awards and Siguum Loudisnre joint-

 

iy sponsoring the first Honors Con-
vocation at this University. i would
hope that this would bathe beginning
of a meaningful tradition.

It will, in any case, be a mo-
menious start. President Collins
will speak, awards will be given
to outstanding students in academic
areas and awards that have always
been left until graduation will be
given. There will also be an aca-
demic procession, an event rarely
seen by undergraduates.

i would like to think that we
could count on a large turnout from
the student body and the faculty to
honor our outstanding students, and
to confirm that we do, indeed, be-
long (and know we beioiigi) among
America’s first-rate Universities.
