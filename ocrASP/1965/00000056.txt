Committee Chairman '

Pet Libudziewski, a member of
this year's nominating committee
will be the committee chairman

will include setting up procedures
for nominations and elections of
officers for the next Assembly.

This is the second consecutive
year that a member from the SEA
chapter at Albany has held a State
office.

On Thursday, April 8, delegates
regietifred, took a tour of the- Al-
bright-Knox Art Gallery, attended
a reception and banquet and went
to Nisgara Fells. . ’

V The keynote speaker at the ban-
quet, Dr. Edward Sage, chairman
of the Department of Education at
we Buffalo, stated that "everyone
has a specific sphere of inﬂuence.”

“Example is not the main thing,
but the only thing in informing
others," quoted Dr. Sage from Al-
bert Schweitzer. "it is up to the
teacher to set a good, example,
showing that not all are lazy or
concerned with the dollar."

He hoped that, “through evolu-
tion and not revolution that we
could change today’s world."

sions and New Trends Workshops

_ “The Pumpkin Eater" is
about .a middle-aged wo-

man’s‘ marrihge to her,

third husband and her ob-
session with having chil-
dren as a jutification for

her marital sex life.

But L‘The Pumpkin Eater" is not
just a psychiatric documentary into
the emotional problems ofa married
woman; rather it is a portrait of a
woman who loves so deeply that
she often suffers injustice from
others, especially her husband who
loves her too, but is incapable of
reciprocating this deep feeling that
this woman has for him and for life
itself.

Obsession with Love
You- could say that she is obsessed

with love, but I suppose that that's‘

what love is all about in a real
sense, not in any idealistic terms
where there is no conflict of per-
‘sonalities.

Anne Bancroft plays this passion-
ate volatile personality with fervor,
s'incerlty, subtleness, and an in-
tensitv that few actors or actresses

 

 

can muster on the screen. '

The tension in her eyes and in
the workings of her: mouth showthia
woman's passion for life that is
concealed under her very attractive
appearance.

Peter Finch plays her devoted
third husband who becomes dis-

‘gusted with all his wife’s children

and the lack of privacy that de-
velops with every newborn baby.
Of course, he turns to other women
lpter, and eventually reluctantiyad-
mits it to his wife, but he does love
her greatly and comes back to her
in the end.

Finch a Shadow ,

As he is not the main concern oi
the movie, he plays his role a
shadow in back of MissBancroft’s,
his entire personality not being re-
vealed on the screen.

He is more of a backstop for his
wife and appears to react to her
moods rather than‘initiate- his own
independent actions himself. He
plays his role well although not in-
tensely (which is good in contrast
to his wife's role).

What makes this movie art rather
than melodrama is the taste with
which it is done, its attention to de-
.tails, the high quality of acting, and

the fact that it takes a marriage

situation and shows all sides of it,

,the bad, the in between,
and the delicate changeover from
one mood toanother.

“Slice of Lite"
Iri'a gro'ss' sense, it could be
called a “slice 9f life," as the
resolutions to the marriage prob-
lem areonly temporarily worked
out and there is no Hollywood happy

by Larry Epstein

Nearly every college student is

'abl'e to analogize between theiname

of the Marquis de Sade and moral~
portraston. Despite his lewd repu-

‘ tattoo, De Sade.,wae an able story-

teller, as can be seen in his three
short works collected under. the
title of "The‘Crimes of Love."

Writes Aldous Huxley in the in-
troductory note:

'“De Sade’s philosophy was the
philosophy of meaninglessnese car-
ried to its logical conclusion.

“Life was without significance.
Values were illusory and ideals
merely the inventions of cunning
priests and kings.

Animal Pleasures

"Sensations and animal pleasures
alone possessed reality and were
alone worth living for. There was
no reason why any one should have
the slightest consideration for any
one else. For those who found rape
and murder amusing, rape and mur-
der were fully legitimate activi—
ties.”

The first story, “Eugenie de
Franvai” has a very well-knit plot
about a man whoinstructs his daugh-
ter t obey him to the point of com-
plete dependence and then seeks to
mdrder his wife.

There are sadistic passages for
those who seek it, but for the most

I a“ m ,   :r ‘.
  Why of Sadistic Freedom

part the stories are well-written,
exciting and interesting.

“Miss Henrietta Straison" is a
lsieaduction story of the highest cali-

r. '
The third story "Florville and
Courval".is the worst of the trio,
but it too' has its merits.

De Sade’s purpose -in writing is
explained in the first few sentences
of “Eugenie de Franval":

Purpose
"To instruct man and correct
his morals: that is our o‘nlypurpose
in writing this story. We hope that
reading it will make one keenly

aware of the peril that always fol-.

lows the steps of those who stop at
nothing in satisfying their desires.

"May they come to realize that
a good upbringing, wealth, talents,
and gifts of nature are likely to
lead one astray unless they are
supported or made effective by self-
restraint, good conduct and mod-
esty.

“These are the truths we are
going to illustrate. We ask to be
forgiven for the monstrous details
of the abominable crime we shall
be forced to describe: it is not
possible to make others detest such
wrongdoing if one does not have the
courage to lay it bare."

The Marquis de Sade was a revo-
lutionary. Again, Huxley's comment
is perfect:

Mailer Views the American llream ’

by Larry Epstein

The American Dream that Nor-
,man Mailer is talking about in his
latest and second best novel “An
American Dream" is, not the New
World idea of achieving money and
fame by Vertical social mobility,
but rather a sex-laden way of think-
ing that all of us in America are
engaged in.

Story Comes of Age

by Gary Koplon

We are all in the great generation
of the short story, a generation of
tumult and speed. Our daily lives
are filled with various time-filling
activities which make the twenty-
four hour day not quite long enough.

As a result, the American reader
has turned to a literature that will
satisfy his impatience. This type
of literature is the short story.

Short stories are Just the right
length to hold any busy reader's
attention. They consist of every
conceivable plot and character, and
their content can be easily under-
stood by nearly every type of reader.

Maugham Comments
Somerset Maugham once said that:
"A good short story is a piece of
fiction, dealing with a single inci-
dent, matorlal or spiritual, that can
be read at a sitting: it ls original,
it must sparkle, excite or impress;
and it must have unity of effect or
impression; it should move in an
oven line from its exposition to its
close."

One such short story is "A Pas-
sion in the Desert" by iionor'e de
Balzac.

 

In “Desert,” Balzac uses the
time-worn incident of the heroic
‘soldier lost in the limitless desert.

Twist Contrived

However, he wittlly contrives a
twist in the incident by introducing
a tale of suspense-exotic and un-
usual. it is a story of nature-of the
encounter between man and beast,
both living together and involved
in the same predicament. The man
is a French Provencal soldier; the
beast is a blond female panther
and it just so happens that this
lioness is the soldier's formidable
hostess.

In this hostile environment
evolves a strange and unique re-
lationship between male and fe-
male, when natural passion controls
the actions of man and beast.

What happens from this point on
is what makes “Passion in the
Desert" a short story made to
order for our generation.

If one wanted‘to consider this
work as a moral tract, Mailer is
saying that the road to Heaven is
paved with bad intentions. There
is an inverse moral code involved.

Novel ls Paradox
But this novel is a, paradox. It
is also possible that Mailer has
just failed.
The reviews of the novel have
been expectedly varied.

Granville Hicks hopes the novel
was a “literary hoax" for if it
isn’t, he said, Mailer was liter-t
arily “kaput.”

John Aldridge in Life said "it
(the novel) may well represent the
first significant step the current
American novel has taken into fresn
territories of the imagination."

The novel itself is the story of
Stephen Richard Rojack, Congress-
man, professor of "existential psy-
chology,” writer, television per-
sonality, lover and murderer.

Rojack gets involved with a host
of people all of whom are despair-v
ingly flat.

Muller's Dream

Ther’c seems to be little doubt
that Mailer’s American Dream is
to be like Rojack. The character of.
Rojack at most times seems to be a
direct projection of Mailer in Mail-
er's daydreams.

Either Mailer is making fun of
sex or he has embraced it in a
fuller sense than he has done before.
