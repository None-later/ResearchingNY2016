Baseball Team ‘Vlallrsi
To Opener Triumph

by John Eloitman

With bad weather causing the cancellation of the
scheduled season opener, the Albany State varsity
baseball team met and defeated Quinnipiac Junior Col-
lege 9-3 in a home contest last Saturday. in its first
game of the year. The Peds were led by starting
pitcher Jim Nass, who hurled the first seven innings.

Nags allowed but three with a timely single. Albany again

runs in his stint, and he
received credit for the win.
it was a big fifth inning
rally that gave the Staters
the victory.

Quinnipiac scored twice in the
first inning and once in the second.
Albany scored once in the first,
and trailed 3-1 at the outset of the
fifth frame.

Left-hander Don Mason led off
the big inning for the Pads with a
safety on a Quinnipiac error. He
was moved to second on Don Mc-
Gurrin's walk. Nass' perfectly ex-
ecuted bunt then loaded the bases.

Mason was thrown out on an at-
tempt to score on a passed ball.
“Pep” Peziiio "re-loaded" the
bases with a walk.

Lefty Mike Putney, who went four
for five in the contest, drove in
State's first two runs of the inning

After Quinnipiac had removed its

ceived a walk to score another run.
A short fly-out by Bill lngino tem-
porarily halted the State onslaught.

Don Mason was awarded first base
on an interference call, with Dick

to McGurrin and Nass accounted
for two more Ped runs, the last
ones for the inning.

A RayView of Sports
by Roy m...

We had the opportunity last Wednesday to wath and
evaluate‘the frosh baseball and tennis teams, as both
squads saw action against Hudson Valley Community
College. Result of our observations: diamondmen over-
matched, netmen superb.

‘. The frosh baseballers were clobbered by a truly
outstanding HVCC team, 17-1. The Hudson Valley team
has beaten the Slena Varsity (9-3) a team the Ped var-
sity is anticipating trouble from. Our frosh just didn’t
have the pitching and hitting (due partly to lack of
enough pro-season practice) to cope with the offensive
and defensive power of the two-year school.

If this game can be of any value at all, it is to point
out how rough a season the fresh do face. Certain
players like Gordie Sutherland, Don Tarquini. Jim
Gradoni, and Joe Gorman displayed definite potential
that just might blossom into performance before the
end of the year. If the freshmen are to enjoy any suc-
cess this season at all, that potential will have to begin
blossoming soon.

On-the other hand we have the frosh netmen. The
six players who participated in the HVCC match — Tom
Walencik, Neil Rosen, Tony Glazer, Bob Dobrusin, Jim
Lucey, and Kevin Magin —-all turnedin creditable show-
ings that, if continued, will insure the racketment of a
highly successful year.

The talentof this sextetis clearly shown in the doubles
match results. State copped all three matches. lostonly
one set en route, and registered a pair of 6-0 sets.
And this was over a highly-touted HVCC squad.

It is unfortunate, indeed, that the frosh baseball team
faces such a predicament: and, contrastingiy, we are
fortunate in having such fine yearling netmen. One thing
both teams do have in common. however, is the prevalent
team spirit. Both teams have exhibited an exuberant
and determined spirit that is always healthy —— and

often missing at State.

Countil includes  , 
in Passing New Budgets

 

Sa

Provisional Council. voted Sunday night to include

 

VOL. LI NO. i6

 

salaries for five student organizational leaders in

the budgets which it passed for the 1965-66 fiscal‘

year. The five positions given salaries are the Co—
Editors of the Albany Student Press ($400 each). the
Editor of the Torch ($200). the General Manager of
WSUA ($400), and the Chief Engineer of WSUA ($200.)

All of the salaries had
been requested by the or—
ganizations. but had been
removed by Finance Com-
mittee at the initial budget
hearings.

The ASP and the Torch editors

had received salaries previously.

WSUA was making a salary request
for the first time. '

_ The salaries were granted only
after long discussion and debate
'which at times became quite pointed
and personally directed.

Arguments Valid

Several valid points were raised
on both sides of the question, how-
ever. They were almost identical
to the points brought out at the
budget hearing on April 11, when
the salary issue first came up.

Those supporting salaries main-
tained that the great degree of
training, time, and responsibility
involved in managing one .ofr-the
major communications media on
campus demanded a salary.

Those in opposition declared that
students receive compensation for
the' work they do in organizations
through the training they receive
and the opportunity to develop their

State Fair Financial Success;
SlS, ASP Earn Top Profits

Approximately six hundred students and faculty turned
out Saturday to make this year’s State Fair successful.
The various booths collected over seven hundred dollars
in the spring-like weather. The center of enthusiasm
was Sigma Lambda Sigma’s water balloon throwing
booth in which the brothers of the fraternity had the
balloons thrown at them. The attraction raised $71 and
earned the booth the distinction of being number one
money-raiser in the Fair.

The Alb a n y Student
Press's edition of “Kick
in the Asp” followed SLS’s
both in popularity as it
raised $57. The pizza stand
operated by the freshman.
junior. and senior classes
collected $52.

In addition to the money raised
Saturday, the faculty has donated
$00 and late permission slips for
women adcd $112. The permission
slips were sold Saturday night in
the women's dormitories for thirty
cents and allowed an extra thirty
minutes late permission.

Doris Young, co-chairmun of the
event, indicated that a final tabu-
lation of all the money raised could
not be issued because many resi-
dence halls, group houses, and
Greeks are planning to donate money
this week.

She called the Fair successful
and said that she hoped that when
the final donations are tabulated
the Fair will have reached the nine
hundred dollar mark. ’

other booths that were present
were the MYSKANlA water throw;
Brubacher Hall's fortune teller,Chi

argued that if one organization is
given a salary, salaries must be
given to all.

The vote of the ASP salaries, the
first to be considered, was 7 in
favor and 4 opposed, with l ab-
stention. Salaries for the other or-
ganizations passed with little dif-
ficulty and similar vote margins.

Contarences Reinstated

Provisional Council also voted
to reinstate the $700 Conference
lines of the ASP and the Torch.
These lines, to send two people
each to an Associated Collegiate
Press Conference in San Francisco
next fall, had been cut by Finance
Committee.

Finance Committee had wanted
to establish the policy‘that Student
