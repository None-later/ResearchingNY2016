Principle Established

We congratulate Provisional Council
for voting to reinstate salaries for the
heads of the ASP, Torch, and WSUA. We
believe that this sanction of salaries by
the representative body of Student Asso-
elation for the third year in a row has
firmly established the principle that
some jobs on campus deserve a salary
which should be and is paid by Student

Association.

At both the initial budget hearings,
and at the Council meeting Sunday night,
the pros and cons of salaries were
labriously considered. Such intensive
consideration of salaries for these three
organizations should not be necessary

in the future.

If and when other organizations feel
that they warrant salaries, we feel sure
that the student governing body will
analyze their request with equal care-

fulness. But

for the better
