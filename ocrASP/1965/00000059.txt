State Students In Welghiliﬂig Moot

Two Albany State students placed
very well in the recent Northern
New York State Weighiifting Cham-
pionship. -

George Nagy and Ed Cummings
represented their individual YMCA
weightlifting groups in this contest
held in Amsterdam, N.Y.

Nagy, competing in the feather-
weight division, won very handily.
Completing successfully all nine
of his lifts, Nagy pressed 155 pounds,
snatched 150, and clean and jerked
210; Nagy weighs 130.

Cummings copped second place
in the lightweight division. Weighing
in at 147 pounds, Cummings pressed
1'70, snatched 165, and clean and

ierked 205.

Nagy is president of Waterbury
Hall's weightlifting club, and he
claims that, with 20 men lifting
regularly and another 10 on and off,
the club should some day become
recognized by the University as an
authorized club and allow it to com-
pete in these meets as such.

Nagy is the weightlifting instruc-
tor tor the Albay YMCA and Cum-
mings operates out of the Schenec-
tady YMCA. Both men are keonly
interested in seeing Albany State
compete in those meets as a club,
and are optimistic about the chances
of the club becoming recognized if
the interest remains.

S.U. Theatre to Present
Misanthrope" May 7, 8

The “Misanthrope.” the
final State University The-
atre production of the year,
is to be presented in Page
Hall on May 7 and May 8.

Written by Moiiere in 1666, this
comment on the hypocrisy and false
society of his times, is one of the
few comedies which has survived
through the centuries.

Alceste, the "mlsanthrope," re-
bels against the false, flattering
manners which characterize his
society. Despite such protestations,
he cannot overcome his love for
Celimono, the coquetie, whose flir-
tatious ways have captivated the
entire court. ‘

Alceste is played by Dimitri Per-

President Gould, trend of the State
University system, has announced
that the Atmospheric Sciences Re-
search Center, the Graduate School
of Public Affairs, and the proposed
School of Criminal Justice have been
assigned to Albany and will be ad-
ministered as parts of the Univer-
sity Center.

President Gould said that this
action was taken us a result of Al-
bany’s continuing program of eval-
uation of administrative arrange-
ments, and has the approval of the
Board of Trustees.

The Atmospheric Center and the
Graduate School have operated under
the direct supervision of the presi-
dent, nnd were out parts of an
operating unit.

The transfer of‘lhc Center is ef-
fective immediately. President
Gould indicated that its University-
wide activities will be continued and
expanded.

A plan in also being developed to
provide for the orderly integration
of the Graduate School of Public Af-
fairs into SUNYA.

The School of Criminal Justice

will be planned from its outset as

Phliinte (Charles Bartlett) and
Eliante )Pamela Boden) are Mo-
liere’s depiction of sincerity which
has adopted to the environment —
an adaptation which Alceste has
failed to make.

Contemporary Application
it is the contemporary application
which director James Leonard

stresses in his interpretation of the

play. Although costumes and setting
reflect seventeenth century French
life, the force of the ideas pre-
sented transcends the limits of a
“period play" and extends Molierc's
comments to the superficialities of
twentieth century living.

Mr. Leonard has emphnsized the
modernity and universality of the
script by simplifying the lavish,
overdone quality associated with
the period.

The set, designed by John Moore,
has captured the blend of passing
centuries. Other characters in the
play are Orone, Arthur Putnam;
Arsinoc, Lillian Spnmpinato;
Acnste, Dennis Tuitle; Clltandre,
John Langion; Basque, PeterNicho-
ins; Dubols and a guard of the
Marshaisca, Walter Doher'ty.

council Discusses Comp Johnston 1

voting ends today on the referendum to approve the new constitution of the student
Association. Students may vote in the Peristyles until 2 p.m. They must present a
tax card in order to cast their ballot. If the referendum is approved. the new gov-
ernment will become active in May. A rejection of the constitution will continue

Provisional Council’s term of office until

by the student body.

Voting was also con-
ducted in the dormitories
last night, and in the Peri-
styles both Wednesday and
yesterday.

At its meeting Tuesday night,
Provisional Council approved nine
more of the 1965-66 organization
budgets. Those approved were Cen-
tral Council, International Students
Association, Art Council, Dramatics

Council, Music Council, University .~

Revue, Camp Board, Department of
Recreation, Outing Club.

in the budgets approved were

funds totaling $11,400 for guest ‘H‘

speakers or artists for international
Students Association, Art Council,
Dramatics Council, and Music Coun-
cil. The budgets passed without
question until that of Music Council
came up.

Guest Artists 1

A discussion then ensued on
whether Provisional Council had the
right to question the choices of in-
dividual groups for their guest ar-
tists. The budget was finallypassed.

An interesting sidellght occurred
during consideration of Department
of Recreation's budget. Finance
Committee Chairman Deborah
Friedman revealed that the budget
contained funds to pay taxes on a
piece of land known as Camp John-
ston.

This was described as “a piece
of land in the middle of a cow pas-
ture" which used to be used for
freshmen orientation. The land has
been up for sale for a number of
years, butthe only prospective buyer
has been the farmer who owns the
land around it.

Ownorahlp Vogue

Meanwhile the Student Association
continues to pay taxes on the land,
althoug it is not known if the land
actually belongs to S.A. or to the
Student-Faculty Association.

Freedom Council's budget was
under discussion, when the meeting
was adjourned ior lack of nquorum.
Freedom Council is asking for a
larger appropriation for guest
speakers as they want to bring Dr.
Martin Luther King as well as other
speakers to the campus.

DEAN HARTLEY OlSCUSSES with students the houarng problem

that has struck the University this past week.

The angered stu-

dents complained about the train impression that they received

trorn the housing questionnaire.

HousingQuestionnaireCouses
Upset in Student Personnel

Embittered student criticism was launched at the
Housing Office in the past week over the false im-
pression that was conveyed to the student in n housing
questionnaire. The questionnaire was uscdbyn Student-
Fuculty Housing Committee to receive an indication of
where students wanted to be housed the coming year.

The controversy arose
because the wording in the
question sheet led many
students to believe that it
would only be used as a
poll and not be binding on
the student.

But after the results were anni-
yzed and the housing committee
announced the policy for housing
next year, students began issuing
complaints to Dean lirown, Asso-
clnto Donn of Students, that they
were told that tho (presiionlmlro
was Just a survey.

Students Change Protoroncoa

Dorm lirown said that runny stu-
dents hurl rushed to his office to
change their preferences. lie was
able to ucconturoduio many students
but others rernnined dissatisfied.

Donn Brown and Dean Edsnll,As-
slsinnt Dean of Women, worked on
the problem Monday night and de-
cided to have nppointnmnis with
dissatisfied students next week to
try to alleviate the problem.

students who are interested in
changing residence hallassignrnents‘
or live off campus next semester
can make an appointment to dis-
cuss their problem with Dean Brown
or Dean Edsall, ‘

Appointmenta
Dean Brown‘said that he hoped

that through these appointments the
student will be able to live where
he wants. He expected that by the
and of next week all students will
be housed.

Dean Brown expressed his belief
that the problem arose because of
misinterpretation by the student
when be filled out the questionnaire
and because the residence hall di-
rector's indicated that the ques-
tionnaire would just he a survey of
student desires.

llc regretted that a problem de-
Volopctl, because he and the housing
counuitiot- tried “to dovelopnhous-
ing policy Io suit the needs of the
students."

Late Permission

Due to a misunderstanding be-
tween Dean Norma Edsail and mem-
bers of SCOPE, some dormitory
girls were prematurely notified that
SCOPE would be selling late per-
missions lo all girls on campus
this weekend. This will not occur.

The misunderstanding stemmed
from a misinterpretation concern-
ing the powers otSoiicltations Com-
mittee. Dean Edsail refused SCOPE
her final approval until the Corn-
lnltiee had voted on the matter. At-
tho Committee's meeting, however,
it was discovered that their con-
stitution had no provision covering
