SUN YA‘tO Give
Aptitude Tests

For Programmers

The Compuhr Programmers
Aptitude Test will be given at SUNYA
on Saturday, May 8, in Draper 349
from 10-12 a.m. An alternative date
for this test will be set up upon re-
quest.

This test is an aptitude test oi
logical ability, which requires no
previous knowledge or training, to
see if specializing is worthwhile
for the individual. The applicant
does not have to be a college grad-
uate; it is only the aptitude being
tested.

Further Training

Results of this test will be con-
fidential. if the test shows the in-
dividual has the required logical
ability, then further training will
be arranged according to the re-
quirements. ,

Academic departments and major
administrative offices will find that
the ability within the department to
write programs for the computer
will give the best results when the
person bridges the area or office
of specialization with the computer
directly.

Each major office and department
will want to inform the computer of
its specialized problems and this is
done best by having trained persons

on the staff learn the specialized ’

conversation of the computer.

Students will be able to find em-
ployment part-time in offices and
departments and in the new Com-
puter Center, and possibly careers
upon graduation, either in Civil
Service, industry or education.

Anyone interested in taking this
test or wanting more information
about the test should see Dean El-
mer Matthews in D-135, the Office
of the Administrative Dean, prior
to May A.

Lounge on the role SCOPE is playing in the South. He stressed '
that the Negro in the South had to be convinced he had rights In

the community.

80lin Speaker Emphasizes Need
To Awaken Negro to His Nights

Tony Scruton, a last minute re-
placement for George Shinholster,
flew from Washington to Albany on
Tuesday night to speak on voter
registration and political education
in the South.

Mr. Scruton is a graduate of
Washington University and has
worked on the SCOPE project for
the past seven months. While in
school, he studied political science.
He said that he had learned what he
had studied about in the south.

Mr. Scrutou’s main point was
that the Negro had to be convinced
that he has rights, that he is as
much a man as the white is. For
this reason, workers wear denim
jackets and work pants to convince
the Negro that he does not need to
wear a suit to vote.

He said that the Negro also must
be convinced that he can enter the
court house.

Court House

In most southern counties, the
Negro thinks of the court house as
white man’s domain. Everythingthat
has ever come out of the court
houses has been bad for him. He
associates segregation, bad schools,
poverty housing and corruption with
the court houses.

Mr. Scruton also said that the
Negro and the northern white must
realize the power of the vote; the
southern oolitican already knows it.

With the vote the"Negro can de-
mand issues such as housing, em-
ployment, and education; not segre-
gation. When the Negro demands
changes and has the votes, his
voice will be heard.

Governor Wallace

Mr. Scruton stressed that Gov-
ernor Wallace as much as any other
politician has a heirachy of values,
in which power and votes, not race,
are at the top.

Scruton said that the situation in
the south, is the responsibility of
the whole country since it was the
north that permitted this situation
to come about.

The north has been thoroughly
apathetic for' too long. Jim Crow
and segregation are products_ of
the twentieth century. With work
and dedication the ills of the south
can be corrected.

The situation is not hopeless.
Great advances have been made.
“Just wait until we get swinging.”
