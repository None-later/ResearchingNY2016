Ae-a political refugee from P0-
land who witnessed both Nazi and
Corniiuntst “discrimination,” Mrs.
1m feels a greater kinship with
the American Negro that with the
American white. _ -
She firsts the Negro leadership
closer to European “intelli-
-gentsia" with its greater aware-
ness of social responsibility."

As a professor at Atlanta, she
lived in a faculty dormitory along
with other white and nnn-‘white pro—
fessors. , ‘

In fact, she recalls, the Univer-
sity frequently enjoyed prominent
European artists and scholars who
altered to speak or entertain at the
campus partly out of concern for
the culturally isolated Negro and
' partly out of curiosity about the

school itself. ' ,

“To my amazement,”slierecalls,
“They told me ‘For heaven's sake

The Negro, according to Mrs.
Iwanska, is actively helping him-
self. She was particularly impressed
by the NAACP and its work. Even
more amazing, in her view, was
the immense patriotism the Ameri-
can Negro still has for his country.

"I thought surely that after such
persecution, they felt alienated from
society, but they are the most pa-
triotic Americans I.have met.

 ttiiti Dignity

This kind of resistance was most
impressive to Mrs. Iwanska. “They
would fight with dignity within the,
limits of the American constitu-
tion.”
' Mrs. Iwanska admits a differ-
ence between the education and non-
educated segments of the Negro
population.
‘ “There is also some discrim-
ination even between the Negro
middle and lower classes them-
selves," she confesses, "but it is
much less impressive than the
fighting spirit."

When asked whether' or not her
attitude on discrimination had
changed when she returned to New
York, Mrs. lwanska has some
pointed observations on Northern

“Most Americans are anti-Negro.
They are 'just a little less so here.
Even though it is not legalized
discrimination, it can be just as
hard to take."

Mrs. Iwanska has observed dis-
crimination between Mexicans and
Indians, peasants’ and urbanites in
Poland, and between the White and
Negro American. She has noticed
that the American Negro is handi-
capped in his light for freedom.
Unlike the Polish peasant, or Mex-
ican Indian, he cannot end dis-
crimination by education and ac-
culturation.

'~ ~ cor-No oneneeds to be told that

these numerals mean James Bond,
British secret service agent ex.
traordinaire.

Ian Fleming's untimely death
(necessarily coinciding with that of
Bond's) was, of course, a sad blow
to the literally millions of Bond
fans who “followed the books with a
passion. ' .

Bond, as an individual, is mostly
Machiavellian. The women and wine
lire there for his amusement to be
discarded at his. pleasure. There
are exceptions to this perhaps un-
fair characterization, the inaln one
being Tracy, La Comtesse Tiressa
de Vicenzo, to, whom Bond is mar-~
ried for a short time.

The normal Bond book is gen-
erally short and has for an evil
character a person who is ugly,
demented and quite often physically
misshapen (Goldfinger, Mr. Big,
Dr. No). It also has at least one
sultry siren for Bond to enjoy (Gala
Brand, Vesper Lynd), and lavish
descriptions of foods, wines, cars
and/or card games.

Punished Brutally
Often in these books, Bond is
captured by tormentors and punished
rather brutally (e.g. Goldflnger
commands Oddjob to break the pinkie
on Bond's left hand).

To kick a man when he’s down,
to assassinate, or to act according
to one's emotions rather than to

reason (however never trying to
break one of M.'s commands) all
seem to beresolved in James Bond’s
philosophy of staying alive.

I suppose very few people take
the James Bond adventures to be
anything close to reality. The secret
of the success of the books seems
to be, in addition to the sheer good
narrative style, their power as an
antidote to the emasculation of the
male that has taken place in thelast
fifteen years.

James Bond is Supermale, dis-
guised as a somewhat mild—inan-
nered employee of a fictitious con-
cern named Universal Export.

Drug-like
There is something drug-like
about James Bond; once you start
reading his adventures, you have to
keep at- it, even if you can’t justify
your reading habits.

The books are easy to read aim
for the most part, just as easy to
forget. What does stick are the
few parts in each book which allow
the reader to see Bond as a human
being and not as a fictional charac-
ter.

I

Many of the ideas in the pre-
ceding paragraphs can be found in'
a new book entitled: "GOV-James
Bond: A Report” by 0. F. Snelling.

This book is certainly recom-
mended for all inveterate Bond fans.

The book is divided into five
divisons, each of which deals with
some aspect of the myth of James
Bond: his predecessors, his image,
his women, his adversaries, and
his future.

No Metaphysics

There are no surprises found in
this book; no cryptic, hidden meta-
physical meanings to Bond’s adven-
tures are given. Instead, Snelliii
presents just what he intended to.

With wry humor, he, in very
complete detail, draws up the de-
finitive biography of contemporary
adventure-fiction’s leading man.
