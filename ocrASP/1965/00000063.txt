A Ray-View of Sports

by Roy MeCloot

3?.

Watched the AMIA track meet last Sunday. andto say
I was surprised-nay, amazed-k-would began unforgive-
able understatement. The meet was the best thing to
come out of the AMIA in recent years, and the biggest
thing to hit the sports department since the cross-
country team was organized four years ago.

The organization, running, spirit, and times of the
meet were excellent and, above all, encouraging. So
encouraging, in fact, that another meet in the near

‘ future is all ready in the making.

First of all, let’s examine the circumstances of the
meet. Held on short notice, on a Sunday afternoon, and
without much publicity, the meet attracted sixty-two
entrants. representing six teams and independents.Yes,
the interest is there.

The times and distances were outstanding, consider-
ing the condition of the field and runners. Bob Glywa’s
10.5 loo-yard dash and 22.9 220-yard dash were really
fine; Ken Darmer’s 39’6" triple-jump and Tom Robin-
son’s 4:50 mile and 2:05 half-mile were equally as fine.
Yes, the talent is there.

The spirit of the crowd was simply marvelous. In
what amounted to an inter-fraternity battle for the
team award, the crowds cheered enthusiastically and
appreciativer for all of the runners, The spirit of the
entrants was great, too, as several entered into events
for the first time, just to win points for their team.
Yes. the spirit is there.

Track is the greatest individual sport in all of
athletics, and nothing creates more spirit and enthu—
siasm in a school than atrack meetwith another school.
All the entrants agreed that they enjoyed competing in
the meet, and all expressed the desire for the formation
of a track club. Siena's recently formed track club has
issued a challenge to State's tracksters. and is anxious
to have an intra-club meet with us. Yes. the need is
there.

The sports department of the ASP sincerely hopes
that this meet serves as the foundation and cause for
the formation of a track club here at State. The inter-
act. the talent, the spirit, and the need are all present.
We know not where to turn to gain support for this
cause except to the student body — and turning there.
we rest our case.

The submitting of the results of the constitutional
referendum by Al Smith, chairman of MYSKANIA, was
the main order of business at Sunday night’s Provisional
Council meeting. The results were 787 affirmative
votes, 91 negative votes. and six nbstentions for a total

of 884 ballots cast.

Twenty-four percent of
the student body partici—
pated in the referendum:
twenty percent was needed
to validate the results. The
passage of the new con—
stitution necessitated the
formation of an election

President Gould Extends Appreciation     
To Students for Budget Cut Protest

Dr. Samuel B. Gould, State Uni-
versity President, has conveyed his
“deep appreciation of the co-opera-
tion of students on the Albany Cam-
pus" in the protest of the recent
budget cut.

In his weekly press conference
with representatives of the ASP and
WSUA, President Evan R. Collins
related that Dr. Gould had made
special mention of Albany's efforts
in his address to the heads of the
State University units.

In Dr. Collins words, the Albany
march had made Dr. Gould “thor-
oughly disliked by legislators, which
he takes to be a sign of its complete
success."

DIsprIlno Impressive

Dr. Collins commented further
that many people had been particu-
larly impressed by “the discipline,
order, and dignity of the march."
He noted that "it had a considerable
impact."

The second quadrangle construc-
tion is still way ahead of schedule,
said Dr. Collins. Although there may

These flags symbolize the 12 prov-

bany’s sister city.

Representing the Government of
the Netherlands will be Mr. J. Van

erlunda Information Service.

Receiving Mr. Van (lainBoguert

of the Dutch Quad, and officials
from the State, the City of Albany,
and the Town of Guildel'land.

vited to attend both the presenta-
tion ceremony and the reception

be a general labor strike in Albany
on or around May 1, he indicated
that “our present assumptions are
geared to the dorm opening on
schedule.”

Dr. Collins also commented on
the recent announcement that the
Atmospheric Sciences Research
Center and the Graduate School of
Public Affairs would come under the
administration of Albany State.

Scientists Available

"It involves the presence here of
a number of distinguished scientists
who would not otherwise be avail-
able," he said. These scientists
would be able to teach classes,
and professors and researchers
here will have a chance to use
facilities not previously available.

A final topic discussed was MYS-
KANIA’s request to Dr. Collins that
one class day be dropped at the end
of this semester to provide a read-
ing day between classes and final
exams.

Dr. Collins explained that he was
forced to deny the request because
the number of class days was al-
ready at the minimum. Normally
the University tries to schedule
75 class days per semester. This
semester there are only 73 1/2
class days due to the two vacations.

Printed below are the texts of
MYSKANIA'S letter to President
Collins, Dr. Collln's reply, and a
subsequent memo from James M.
Lewis, Assistant to the President.

Door President Collinsx

The members of MYSKANIA would
like you to consider lilo possibility
of cancelling classes on May 26,
1005.

It is the opinion of many students
at the University that one study day
prior to filial examinations is not
sufficient time for proper prepara-
tion. A cancellation of classes on
May 20 would help to alleviate this
pi‘ObIelll by providing an extra day
for such preparation.

We would appreciate any and all
consideration you could give to this
mater.

Allan R. Smith
Chairman, MYSKANIA

Dear Allan:

After receiving your request to
cancel classes on May 20,1revlewed
this with the deans. As l told you at

that time, the principal problém
would be the actual number of class
days held this semester.

We try to hold to the minimum of
75 days of actual classes. This se-
mester is already down to 73 1/2
and i don't think we can afford to
lose another day. However, we shall
schedule an extra reading day next
semester if at all possible.

Evan R. Collins

Door Mr. Smith:

President Collins thought you
would like to know that 2 reading
days have been scheduled for Fall
Semester, 1905, and 2 for Spring
Semester, 1900. The days so des-
ignated are January 10 and 11,
(Fall); May 31 and June 1 (Spring).

James M. Lewis
Assistant to the President

office for both Central Council and
Living Areas Affairs Commission
will take place in the residence halls
and Greek houses.

Commuters should present the
same statement on the days ap-
pointed in the Student Personnel
Office. A further schedule will ap-
pear in Friday's ASP.

Those interested in nominating
themselves should present their hall
or house present with a statement
of name quadrangle, and a brief
statement of qualifications and/or
interest.

llaii meetings will be held tonight
to explain the procedure and nom-
inations will begin tomorrow and
last till Sunday.

The elections for the offices will
be held Monday, May 10 with the
orientation ofihe newly—elected Liv-
ing Areas Commission officers on
Wednesday, May 12.

Commuters (apartment dwellers
and those working for mom and
board off campus are included) and
those unable to vote at the appointed
times may Vote in the peristyles
Monday, May 10.

Since elections are based on living
areas as of September.1065,ssniors
may not vote or run for office inthe
forthcoming elections.

MYSKANIA will organize Inaug-
uration Day ceremonies which will
be held May 15. .

Discussion limiting people to run-
ning for either a commission or at
large ensued, but no decision was
reached.

In other action, $200 was appro-
priated to Statesman to go to the
World's Fair in New York on May
15 to participate in the Day of Song.

The money was appropriated from
the S. A. Emergency Spending Line
to pay the traveling expenses of the
group.

Book of Poetry Now on Sale

A unique event in the history of
the University occurred last week,
when Harold Noakes, Jr. became
the first student ever to publish a
book. His book enlitled“YoungSun”
is a collection of poetry that he
has written in the past five years.

Noakes is a junior at State and,
is majoring in English. lie says
that throughout his life he has had
an overwhelming interest in lan-
guage and literature and a great
love for the “natural which is un-
talutsd by the trappings of mater-
ial progress.” ,

l 9 says that this feeling was ac-
quired in a youth spoilt running
semi-wild in the Adirondacks. ills
attributes a short eullstmonlln the
navy as the second greatest influence
on his poetry.

in the Navy he found “in an un-
restrained power and lnoxorabiiity
of the sea a spirit of wildness with
which he could identify." Recurrent
references to the aha in his poems
is an indication of the tremendous
influence the Navy played on his

mile considers his poetry like na-
ture because it is both organic and
ordered. To him, the poem is an
"organic, Verbalized extension of
an elwrgizing situation or exper-
ience." He writes while the orig-
inating stimuli is still acting on

him and the excitement of the mo-
ment can be transformed into an
ordered verbal form without losing
continuity with the experience.

The book will be reviewed by
Harry Staley of the English Da-
partmeni and will appear in Fri-
day's ASP. '

The book will be sold in the
Bookstore and Perlstyles today
-through Thursday for $1.00.
