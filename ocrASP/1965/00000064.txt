Courage oi Conoocation

To the Editors:

1 wish to thank you on behalf of
the Joint Committee on Honors Con-
vocation for the fine coverage given
the -University's first Honors Con-
vocation and particularly for the
editorial in last Friday's issue.

At the same time may [call at-
tention to the omission of the name
of Miss Miriam Ward, who was one
of the hard-working members of
Signum Laudis who made the day
so successful, and to the mis-
spelling of Miss Elezabeth Burger's
name. -

Advice to Freedom Council

To the Editors:

1 have been noticing with a great
deal of interest from outside of
the State University of New York
at Albany the spirited activities of
the Campus Freedom Council in
their efforts to raise funds to send
a team of students South to work
in the “Black Belt” this summer.
1 earnestly support this movement,
if, and only if, it is done right.

Unfortunately, there has been a
resurgence of the radical left in
many of our universities today.
Earnest, dedicated students are
lured into many organizations by
underground Communist-front
groups. it is done so that the stu-
dents who are inclined to be too
outspoken, who insist upon wearing
the clothes that mark them as social
rebels (in particular, dungarees,
old-faded colored shirts and sneak-
ers, not to mention the wearing of
not so well-kept beards) would be
chosen by various steering com-
mittees to go South. These students
by singing Civil [lights songs and in
their general attitudes being openly
antagonistic may integrate a few
restaurants and other public places,
but they also cause hard feelings
and dissention among the various
sections of the United States. Thus
many well-meaning students are
unwitting agitators who cause
trouble, hard feelings and general
animosity toward the North.

Here in Albany, there is astudeut
movement to educate and otherwise
help Negroes in the slum areas. i
believe that these students are soc-
cessful because they maintained a
somewhat quiet, determined, and
conservative attitude toward the
people whom they are helping. in
their own area, they are quite on-
Viously doing more for the Civil
Rights movement than all the beard
and dungaree-wearing, song singing
Civil [fighters who go South to “try
and make martyrs out of them-
selves."

Perhaps all that We said doesn't
cut any ice with the members of the
Freedom Council, but let us reason
a little bit as college students should

it you (were a person in your
forties and fifties and beyond, how

 

wou you as some person much
younger, clad in the garb of a so-
cial rebel, playing songs on aguitar
came into your area, and insolentiy
tried to change everything around
without any given reason beyond
“We Shall Overcome?" You and 1
both would be liars if we said that
we would welcome it. However,
wouldn’t we all be feeling more
kindly and tolerant, if a well-
dressed, soft-spoken, tactful, but
firm and resolute young person
came into our same area with good
reasoning to back up their actions.
These people would not cause trouble
and also they would serve to aid and
educate the same Negro neighbors
that we have been scorning for years.

The leftist movement today has
been infiltrating peaceful marches
and demonstrations and subverting
them into brawls, riots, and general
free-for-ails. It is no secret that
the riots of last summer inRoches-
ter and Harlem were started by a‘
number of busloads of agitators and
not the rank-and-file citizenry.
However, we can imagine that the
Negro residents are still bearing
the blame for these riots. This is
also happening in the South.

For the ultimate good of Civil
Rights, 1 am challenging the Free-
dom Council in the State Univer—
sity of New York at Albany to re—
vise thelr procedures and try to
lure the more conservative and
dedicated student into their group
and thus send South this summer
the type of student who does notneed
to sing freedom songs to bolster
their courage. This type of student
will shun the riots and the general
forms of agitation and go abouttheir
business quietly and resolutely.
They will be a part in helping the
Civil Rights movement and also in
discrediting the present leftist re-
surgence.

Before I close, 1 want to introduce
myself as Loren Harriman. I am a
working man in Albany, but [have
been South on my vacations as a
Civil Righter. i am an ardent lib-
eral, but I feel quite strongly that
Civil Rights movement must come
off right, or it must not come off
at all. So much can be done to hurt
the movement and thus set the Negro
back many, many years in his fight
for ultimate freedom and equality.
if it is done right, the Negro will
soon be able to live in peace and
equality with his fellow man, no
matter where he may be.

Coach Congratulates AMIA

On Successful Track Meet

in the Editors:

lieurtiest congratulations to each
and every student who helped make
last Sunday’s AMlA track meet the
great success it wusl The fine
sportsmanship, the large number of
competitors and the quality of the
performances were a sight indeed
to see.

To Gary Moore, President of
AMlA, Tom Robinson and Ken Dar-
mer a special vote of thanks for
their work in coordinating so many
of the details in suchameet.8pecial

acknowledgment, too, to Jake John-
ville, John Woiner, Dick Abrams,
Steve Ostrove, Bob Flick, fan Leet,
Ken Kirik, Don Woodruff, and Mr.
Joseph Silvey for their tireless and
somewhat thankless efforts in lining
and setting up the field and injudging
and timing the events.

Last but not least is the apprecia-
tion of the various fraternities, clubs
and individuals who participated.
Over sixty students took part and
had there not been severalimportant
conflicts with other events within the
university an even larger number
would have been represented.

The success of this truly fine
meet was crowned by a perfectly
thrilling team battle between two
strong and energetic fraternity
teams with the championship not
being decided until the final event.
It was a great day and a good time

was had by all.

Student Criticizes Havoc
Caused bu Housing Office

To the Editors:

Once again, we congratulate the
Housing Office on the success of its
annual Spring Housing Havoc.

Preparations for the long-antici-
pated event began early in the se-
mester when the housing officers
blithely distributed hundreds ’of
harmless little questionnairesladen
with such unassuming queries as:
"if it were possible for juniors to
live off campus, would you consider
taking an apartment?"

With much glee and astonishment,
they noted the overwhelming re-
sponse of students affirming their
avid desire to leave the University
residence and quotas were set up
to limit the flood of exuding upper-
classmen.

But what is this we hearTCries
of “Traitor 1" rise among the baffled
winners of the lucky apartments.
(What do you mean, we signed a
contract?) Can it be that the enthu-
siasm was merely theoretical?
clutching the little sheets of paper
which inform them of their prize,
the doomed flock to the Housing
Office with loud protests.

With never a quiver or moment
of doubt, however, the glorious band
of administrators rises to new
heights of glory and serenely bushes
the babbling crowd with promises of
possible action “next week.” To
those multitudes lackingany housing
whatever, they bravely assert the
need for calm in chaos and attempt
the impossible task of reassigning
quarters.

Never fear, however. All is not
lost. With its characteristic resi-
lience the University will weather
this new assault on its dignity.
Those "Wandering Pilgrims" willI
somehow, somewhere find a place
to live. (The Towns House is great
this than of year.) '

in the meantime, an old and poig-
nant question looms leet'llngly over-
head: Can't anybody here play this

air. half hour
, t the rate of

minute. This locally the latest in
the long history hours sales. the discovery of a
“good thing” having been made. ; I ',

This Saturday would have witnessed yet another bid
for the hundred or "so dollars that hours sales usually
pull in, except for a misunderstanding between the or—
ganization and DeanEdsall concerning the omission of
such hours provisions in the constitution of Solicitations
Committee. SCOPE is still attempting toobtnin the per—
mission necessary tobegin the wholesale merchandising
of half-hour late permissions in the Peristyles. Pro-
ceeds are to be directed toward this summer’s voter
registration project lathe South.

We take issue with the entire principle involved in
the sale of such-late permissions. By ﬂinging down the
thirty or thirty-five pieces of silver in return for a
sparse thirty minutes of continued liberty. the coed is
put in the position of having to pay for something that
should, by rights, be hers.

The University attempts to keep all those living in
University Housing under close surveillance by re-
quiring 1 a.m. weekend hours. and yet. when money
comes to be involved in the scheme of things, it is
found that trust, too, can be “extended.”

There are many good and reasonable arguments to
be used for the revision of women’s hours. reasons that
would serve to eliminate any further sales of such a
flexible principle. It is up to AWS to straighten out the
present abberation with the administration, and finally
to arrive at a workable solution for the question of
women’s hours.

A stipulation was added to the
original motion that the money was
to be allocated only on the condition
that the Faculty-student Association
refuses to grant said funds to the
group. The question was raised as
to why the University does not it-
nance such a trip.

Debate Council, and Forum of Poli-
tics were passed as submitted orig-
inally.

Student Activity Fee $28.50
The final act in the passage of
budgets was the recommendation of
a Student Activity Fee for 1965-1966
by Provisional Council. Chairman
Friedman moved that it be set at
$28.50. “

Budgets Passed

Thursday, April 29, another meet-
ing of Provisional Council was held.
Final action was taken on the re-
maining S.A. proposed budgets for
the 1965-66 fiscal year.

The budget of Freedom Council
was passed after the speakers line,
which was cut to $1,000 by Finance
Committee, was restored to the
original request of $1,600.

Finance Committee Chairman
Debby Friedman moved to increase
the Parents' Day line of the U.C.A.
proposed budget to $2,100, an in-
crease of $600. Parents' Day co-

It was explained that thislncrease
of one dollar was needed to balance
the total budget which was higher
than that originally submitted by
Finance Committee as a result of
Council actions reestablishing sal-
aries, conference lines, and other
miscellaneous additional appropria-
tions.

The total 1965-1066 budget for
Student Association is $115,515.82.
The 1964-65 S.A. budget was almost
$92,000.

 

chairman Lin White explained that
the additional funds were needed to
help finance a concert which would
be given in the eventing.

After lengthy debate on why the
money was needed for entertain-
ment which was provided last year
by the All University Reception, the
motion was passed.
