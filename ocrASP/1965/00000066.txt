Student-Faculty AA UP Panel

Questions Teacher Evaluation

Evaluation of teaching skills,
either by the student or established
criteria, presents an unpredictable
problem on the university level.

.Three faculty members of Yale
University debated this question with
two students last week, and arrived
at the conclusion that teacher eval-
uation has to include the professor
as well as course material and the
academic level of students.

John M. Blum, cilalrmanof the
Yale History Department; Gerald
K. Helielner, assistant professor
of economics; as Charles E. Rick-
art, chairman of Yale’s Mathemat-
ics Department took part in a panel
discussion with Howard Moffett,
chairman of the Yale Daily News,
and Richard Fabian. chairman ofa
committee to determine teacher
evaulation procedure.

anel

The panel discussion was spon-
sored by the American Association‘
of University Professors, and was
moderated by Arthur W. Galston,
professor of plant physiology. The
three members of the faculty ex-
pressed doubt that teaching skills
can be evaluated, while the students
argued for the validity of such a
procedure.

Moffett declared that evaluation
oi the teacher takes place every day
in the classroom, when the student
attempts to analyze his professor’s

approach to a problem, and his ulti-
mate solution.

Mr. Bium centended that the cri-
teria we care most about finding in
the teacher is the "quality of a
man's mind and his intellectual in-
tegrity.” He did not think that an
evaluation of skills could adequately
judge such inllerent qualities.

Evaluation Means Improvement

The argument was then advanced
that by admitting to the fact. that
teaching skills cannot be evaluated,
one lnust be satisfied to say that it
is something which cannot be im-
proved upon.

Fabian contended that even a lec-
ture lends the student the oppor-
tunity to gain insight into the teach-
er’s mllld, and determine what type
of a mind the professor actuallv has.

He tellded to state that the motl-
vation of each student Ill the class-
room will not be the same, and that
taking the graduate course and
teaching it on the undergrad level
will probably cause the instructor
to fall. He judged the success of
the course material on the basis
of the “happiness co-eft'iclent."

Mr. lielleiner concluded that the
incentive system is actually the lil-
stitution that needs revision. He
stressed the fact that the professor
will tend to devote time on what
they are most likely to get rewards

vestment, with low cost

Belmon‘do, Sebcrg Star

Tonight and tomorrow night,-lFG
will present “Breathless,” Jean-
Luc Godard's pathbre'aking film
which has provoked the entire gamut
of critical opinion from “Master-

‘ piece" to “Bilgel”

The‘ film stars Jean-Paul Bel-

mondo (last seen in "That Man

From Rio) and Jean Seberg, of

. “Lilith” fame. Ostensibiy the film

is about a young thief who is ac-
customed to having anything he wants
merely by grabbing. ‘

On one occasion, however, he gets
caught and winds up killing a cop.‘
He flees to his American girl friend.
He stays there for a time - until
she turns him in because she gets
mad at him.

The real importance of “Breath,-
less" is found in the internal struc-
ture and references, however. It 3
the first real success of the French
"la nouvelle vague."

in the late 19505, Godard, along
with Francois Truffaut (“The 400
Blows," “Shoot the Piano Player,”
“Jules and Jim") and Alain Res-
mais ("Night and Fog," “Hiro-
lshima Mon Amour") edited a con-
!roversiai French cinematicjournal
called “Calliers du Cinema."

These three men felt that the best
film makers were the ones who both
write and direct their own pictures,
thus making some kind of personal
statement about the hUman condition
by means of their absolute control.

This notion of control over all
facets of production, although it may
have been sound initially, has had
some rather strange results. Cer-
tain directors and stars have be-
come greatly admired no matter
what they have produced.

Particularly fascinating to the
“Colliers” people were American
gangster films, no matter their
