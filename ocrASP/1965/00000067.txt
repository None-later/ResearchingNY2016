Music Performers Deserve

large Concert Attendance
To the Editors: V

in the past we have noted a gen-
eral lack of student support in re-
spect to University activities. As
members of the University Concert
Band and Orchestra, looking forward
to our upcoming Spring Concert, we
:find it necessary to continue this
somewhat belabored issue.

This year these groups have de-
veloped notable reputations under
the competent direction of William
Hudson. Their concerts, although
meagerly attended, earned them
commendable reviews in the local
Albany papers as well as in the
Student Press. We feel that most
students have not been made aware
of the valuable opportunities which
these organizations now offer to
them. .

This striking improvement has
not developed of and by itself, but
rather it is the result of persistent
and conscientious efforts on the
parts of all those concerned. Hope-
fully, these efforts should be re-
warded by a substantial attendance
at concert time. However, we find
it most disappointing, after such
elaborate preparation, to be con-
fronted with the usual apathetic
turnout.

This is the time when we as
students should be taking advantage
of every possible cultural exper-
ience made available to us. Cer-
tainly our own groups should be

pus. Freedom Council'is'ﬁ indi-
pendent student organization on
campus, just like the Arts Council
or the Outing Club. Its purpose is
to inform the student body on both
sides of the Civil Rights issue and
to act as a focal point for Civil
Rights activities concerning State»
students. An example of the first
purpose would be any one of the
several programs that have been
held for the student body and fac-
ulty. An example of the second
would be the introduction of many
students into various worthwhile
private tutorial and social work
projects in Albany that are unre-
lated in the campus organization.

A second example of the latter
purpose would be Dean Hartley's
referral to Freedom Council two
months ago of a letter from the
Southern Christian Leadership
Council (SCLC-Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.'s Civil Rights organiza-
tion) asking for the creation of a
SCOPE chapter here on campus.
Freedom Council members passed
the idea on to interested non-mem-
bers and gave them its blessings
and moral support. The Alhany
SCOPE chapter was then set up
completely independent of Freedom
Council, the major correlation being
that myself and one other Freedom
Council member are now working for
SCOPE too.

So much for Mr. llarrimau's first
basic misconception. The second and
more important one ishisburboring
of the widespread belief that mostof
the recent flurry of activity in the

encouraged to develop the” cap" direction of equal rights has been

abilities to the utmost. A univer-
sity should take pride 'in its or-
ganizations. The concerts to he
presented in Page Hall on May 11
and 13 will reflect the continual
achievements of the Department of
Music. We feel that these perfor-
mances merit your whole-hearted

support.

as an Albany businessman inter-
ested in Civil Rights. ilo then pro-
ceeded to lambasi the Freedom

ber of very sound but tonlly unre-
lated topics. Although Mr. llarrl-
man seems to be a well-intentioued
individual, i am afraid that he is
almost completely ignorant of the
existing situation on campus. Per-
haps he was stirred into prema-
ture action by a rambling, largely
irresponsible article in a recent
"Saturday Evening Post” which
tried at length to prove that all young
Americans who are not active mem-
bers of Robert Welsh-sponsored
Boy and Girl Scout Troops are ac-
tively planning the violent Corn-
munisiic overthrow of the Federal
Government. Whatever his reasons,
however, i feel that it is necessary
to both reply to his fears and to
correct any distorted facts that he
may have put forth to the general

attest to the truth or falsity of this
statement on any national,» state, or
even city level, (although through
considerable contact with Civil
flights people in both New York City
and the South and through work in
some organizations and projects I
know this to be mostly false) but]
will just stick to the limited area
of Civil Rights on campus, specifi-
cally SCOPE.

The SCOPE project on the na-
tional scale is going to send over
1500 tenths of student volunteers
from' as many schools around the
,country into 120 blackbolt counties
of the Deep South for ion weeks this
summer. They are not going to be

five voluntnors to join them in their

extensively screened as to their

suming, their attitude, and their
motives for volunteering. They are
not permitted to apply if under 21
unless full parental approval is oh-
tallied.

0n campus they will be screened

dents headed by Mr. John Reilly of
the English Department. Those who
are accepted are then screened ona

officials before being completely

go through extensive training and

Most of the rest of us on the
SCOPE staff are anything but the
bushy haired Communists that Mr.
Harriman is frightened of Many of
us are working through the auspices
of campus Newman Club or Campus
Christian Council, both of which
officially support us, and neither of
which are reknowned for their radi-
cal tendencies. Most of the ‘beats’
that do exist on campus take no
more than occasional moral interest
in the support of Civil Rights, or
most anything else, and should not
in any way be connected with either
SCOPE or Freedom Cornell.
must thank Mr. iarrlman for
his interest in the future and suc-
cess of the Civil Rights Movement
as a whole, and I agree with him on
many of his points, but I must also
'ask him, next time that he feels the
'urge to take pen in hand, to know
at least a little about that which he
intends to fight and not to so thor-
oughly misinterpret and distort.
By doing so he is merely defeating
his own purposes and harming that
which he professes to extoll.

“Several students and faculty members have started a

local chapter of the Summer Community Organization
and Political Education project on campus. SCOPE is
a nationwide project to recruit students from colleges
throughout the country to go to the South to register
voters. , ‘

« Thus far, the project has shown a need for students
to collect money and do publicity work. But above all,
the drive needs money. Less than ahundred donors has
been collected from the student body in the past three
weeks. , '

problem that plagues the country.
Yet. a project attempting to alleviate this problem
cannot find adequate support on campus. it is not

enough to be for Civil Rights. You have to be actin-

We are not asking that all students show their

concern by registering to go South, though they should
if they can, but just contribute to the project with

us-ussn History of Conflict
Stems From World War II

lay Mike Farenell

wenty years ago this month, in
a little school house, Alfred Jodi,
commander-ln-chlef of the German
armies, surrendered to Dwight-
Elsenbower, supreme commander
-of the Allied nations. World War II
was over for Europe.

By some error of policy on the
part of Washington, General Eisen-
hower permitted the Soviet troops
to enter Berlin first. This was to
begin history of non-violent con-
flict between Soviet and American
ideology.

According to the agreement
reached by Allied leaders at the
Potsdam Conference, the United
States, Britain and France would
control the western sector of Ger-
many and of Berlin; the Russians
exercised their influence in the
eastern sector.

Also, according to the Potsdam
agreement, the Allies were supposed
to engineer free elections and even-
tualiy reunite the two Germanys.
of course, when time came for
these elections, the Russians balked
andvGermany remained disunited.
The Iron Curtain was dropped and
the United Sixties appeared to stand
by uninterested.

Berlin Airlift-i948

The Russians, however, were not
satisfied with their half, so they
embarked on a campaign to evict
the Western Powers from their
portion of Berlin. The first attempt
came in 1948 when the Russians
attempted to "choke off” supply
routes into the divided city.

The Allies (United States, Brit-
ain, and France) frustrated this

For the time being Berlin was sale.

No new attempts to evict the
West were initiated by the lids-
sians until 1961. At this time, tin-
Russians erected a “wall” to pro-
vent the escape of refugees to the
“promised land" of West Iicrllu.
Again the United States and her
"allies" stood idly by.

Albany’s annual Tulip Festival
will reach its high point tomorrow
in Washington Park when the city's
Tulip Queen will be coronated. Seven
of the eleven finalists are State
Co-eds.

These seven girls: Margaret
Dletz, Judith Jordan, Mary Komor-
ny, Ann 'l‘enbrook, Diane Floody,
Jocelynn Kole, and Bonnie Mason,
are all vielng for the honor of
ruling over the festival this year.

Originally, over 200 girls were
nominated for the honor and these
eleven finalists are left after pre-
liminary juding. A panel of three
out-of-towners will make the final
queen selection and the winner an-
nounced Saturday.

The Queen and her Court repre-
sent the city of Albany throughout
the year and therefore selection is
done with great care. The person-
ality, appearance, background ex-
perience and poise of each contestant
is rated during interviews by the
judges Albany’s Tulip Queen be-
comes ihe hometown ambassador
for the year. She also receives a
vacation trip to Miami. During her

Margaret Diet:

reign, the queen will be required
to appear at luncheons, store open-
ings and other city functions and
give brief speeches.

Contract Necessary

As part of the contest, the girls
are required to sign a contract
which stipulated, among other-
things, that they may not marry
during the year nor enter any other
contests.

The Tulip Festival is held every
May as a bond between the city of
Albany and Holland. It is to recog-
nition of the background of the city
‘and an exchange that occurred in
World War I.

On Saturday, the Queen finalists
will be escorted by Albany Academy
and Christian Brothers Academy
officers. Albany High School Band
will play and Maureen Glasheen,
1964 Tulip Queen, will crown her
successor. The new queen will re-
ceive the gold key to the city from
Mayor Corning and the ten remain-
ing finalists will serve as her court.

Saturday night the royalty are
whisked to the Tulip Ball at the

President Collins Explains Dilemma

In First Honors Convocation Address

Faculty, students, parents,
guests, especially those of you whose
names are in this first Convocation
program — you who are the hope
of the world. I say that without ir-
reverance, and without humor. I
mean it quite literally.

To you much has been given, and
from you, indeed, much will be ex-
pected.

You are a group selected for a
combination of brains, and the nio-
tivatlon to use them. You combine
certain very important character-
lstics. You honor intellect. You
honor rational processes. You be-
lieve in brains as an effective in-
sirument for the sollltiuli of prob-
lems.

In congratulating you we seek to
understand better ourselves; we de-
‘scrihe better our conception of a
University.

illuminate Understanding
It is this i shall attempt to do
this afternoon. in interpreting you
to yourselves, we illuminate ourowu
understmldlng about our University.
Less its functions than its essential

characteristics. Less its stated pur-

.poses than its purposeful gropings

toward its dreams and visions.

So I will point out that on behalf
of us all, you especially share the
ideals of the University. Because
you do, you partake of the dilemma
of the University, and acknowledge
the freedom of the University, and
therefore share inthe responsibility
of the University.

You share the ideas of the Uni-
versity in this why: Whenever we
describe the University we describe
an ideal. It goes back a long way.
Its origin in the Middle Ages is re-
ilectcd in the gaudy gowns that we
wear on this occasion, less useful
now than they were for keeping out
of the drafts of cold monasteries;
the hoods less useful ibuu they used
to be in keeping the l'illll off the
wearer's head, or for serving as
a basket for the bread ho begged
from door to dual".

nlfles to some extent the withdrawal
from the world that was the charac-
teristic of the academic community
of the Middle Ages.

To maintain the truth, to pre-
serve the truth, to preserve knowl-
edge, to shield it from the uncer-
tain world outside; Life within the
monastic community was indeed
very different from life in the world
around. ilut if was very similar to

life in similar communities all
over the world, communities of
scholars.

The scholar anywhere in the world
know others like him in Paris, or
Bologna, or London. National bottli-
darics were no barriers to minds;
language did not limit the scholar.
There were no obstacles of time.
Their writings once preserved, the
great dead of scholarship were not
silent, though the winds ofcenturles
bud blown across their graves.

There is much vitality in this
ideal still. Imagination is seized by
the concept of this great timeless
company that all can join, not by
virtue of birth or breeding, but by
virtue of brains and hard work, the
willingness to accept the require-
ments of the community as a way
of life and a way of study.

basic Condltians Unniterod

The basic conditions remain the
some; the search for truth still
requires the acceptance of clearly
defined procedures and commit-
ments, sacrifices of money and
time arc required, willingness to
accept the. limitations of the schol-
nrly method, the discipline of ru-
tiouul procedure.

The umderu shutout is the some,
even though dlffcroui. Some of the
host characteristics of the modern
student were described recently by
an anonymous ivy League assistant
proiossor talking about his owustu-
dents and saying, “They are eager
and col biaso.”

“'l‘hoy do not Wear their intel-
leciuulism as a market status, or
make of books and ideas an in-
struluont oi self-glorification or an
excuse for self-alienation."

No Longer Truth
The greatest change in the Uni-
versity over the ages probably has
been that We no longer feel that we
possess the truth; even those who

Glosheen’s Reign Ends

Crowning of the 1965 Tulip Queen,
marks the end of the year reign of
Maureen Glasheen, the present
queen, a sophomore at Albany State.
Highlights of her rule includean ap-
pearance at the Armed Forces Day
celebration at the Arsenal. She hos-
tessed the Mobile Economy Run in
Albany and rode in the St. Patrick’s
Day Parade.

Maureen also earned a ten day
vacation trip to Californialast June.

Queen Maureen feels her reign
most rewarding, the intangible un-
measureabie. She considers the
queenshlp, as a job, one of the
greatest challenges, testing one's
talents and capabilities. The "job"
demands much time and energy,
according to Maureen, and is only
one-tenth glamour and nine-tenths
hard work. ' ,

 

Washington '

"You...are the most distinguished among the distinctive, the
most successlui among the superior."

This is a heritage that is com-

stlll wear "Veritas" on their coat
of arms. instead we acknowledge
that we seek the truth.

The day is gone when the Uni-
versity felt it had the truth to safe-
guard aud protect. Now we know
that the best we can do is pursue
the truth; to establish the conditions
to expedite. this quest for truth; to
make sure that the scholars are in-
deed free to examine and test all-
facts, all ideas, including the un-
ploasani, the distasteful, those even
that seem dangerous, even, indeed,
those regarded by the majority of
the faculty as certainly erroneous.

The ideal of the University, then,
combines historically two elements:
a sense of withdrawal from the
world to some extent at least, in
order to be freer to solve the
world's problems, a sense even
today of being separated from some
of the world's requirements and
penalties in order to perform an
important function in the world.

Secondly, the sense of this free-
dom is maintained bytho acceptance
of the academic community’s own
principles, a common allegiance to
its ideals.

piicated by the fact that we no
longer feel that we hold the truth,
out that we seek it. This compli-
cation proves what 1 refer to as
the dilemma of the University. And
in this dilemma, of course, you
share.

Because we are forced to engage
in opposing activities. On the one
hand, we are busily teaching the
truths as we know it with all the
conviction we possess. At the same
time we are exploring and testing
and pushing back frontiers and dis-
covering new truths, even if it in-
validates the truth we just finished
teaching.

We teach with conviction the best
we know, even while we pursue with
vigor the truth that is yet unknown.

Similarly, in a related area, the
University has the responsibility of
preserving and transrnittiugthe val-
ues and beliefs of the society which
supports it, at the same time re-
examlning, refining, and reestab-
llshiug the values, beliefs, subject-
ing them to the most rigorous scru-
tiny.
