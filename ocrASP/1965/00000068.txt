Psychotherapist, Marriage Counselor
Sanctions ‘The Legitimate Pickup’

Dr. Albert Ellis, New York psy-
chotherapist and marriage coun-
selor, has given authoritative, ver-
bal sanction to something that co-
‘eds-and young ladies in general-
have 'been doing for some time:
“picking up" a likely looking man
as a potential date, companion, or
even husband.

it is time, says Dr. Ellis, that
the word “pickup” be furnished.
In an article in the May "Made-
moiselle," the therapist goes sev-
eral steps further, in fact, to cham-
pion what he calls “The Legitimate
Pickup."

His thesis is that it's perfectly
right and proper for the woman to
take some initiative in the matter
of boy meets girl.

Today, if one follows the wait-
to-berasked policy, the usual
sources for meeting men produc
relatively few likely young male
actuaintances. Many of Dr. Ellis's
patients have high standards for the
many! they hope to marry, whereas
the men they meet usually fall into
the ' categories of "creeps,"
"bores," "professional liomeos,"
and “married playboys."

There are numerous approaches
the girl can use: mistaken identity,
asking him for directions when she’s
"lost her way," commenting on a
picture in an art gallery, or asking
the name of a tune at a dance.

Pitfalls

There are some pitfalls in pur-
suing this technique of man hunting
that might end in mlsfires. Per-
haps the gentleman, once met, in-
correctly assumes that she is look-
ing for a sex playmate.

It won't take him long to find out
he was wrong.

What if the whole encounter falls
flat? Perhaps the girl was not per-
ceptive enough to notice-or find out-
that the man was” married. This can
be determined by subtle, indirect
questions rather than cooling right
out with the query.

Or perhaps the man sensed that
she was a young woman onthe make,
too frantically in search of a mate.

The main stumbling block, Dr.
Ellis found, is the girl's estimation
of herself based on a lifetime ul
indoctrination. When she says she
is afraid of “other people’s” opin-
ion of her, this usually means that

‘ she herself thinks the method is
"wrong" and "immoral," which
'Dr. Ellis interprets to mean that
she has a poor opinion of herseli.
if she believes that she's doing

nothing wrong and has a good opin-
ion oi herself, the opinions ofothers
aren't going to disturb her.

Dr. Ellis points out that if a girl
were looking for the "right" job,
she would Spend considerable time
checking out limitless 'job possi-
bilities, before settling upon the
one she wanted.

Premarital Auditioning
“it is only reasonable that the
search for a truly worthwhile man...
should require at least an equal
amount of time, concentration, and
care in the premarital auditioning
of partners.”

The advantage of the legitimate
pickup is that it offers a girl the
chance to be more selective in the
choosing of a friend, date, or hus-
band.

One solution, which may not yet
hold good for the rest of the country
but which is fast gaining ground in
New York, is the "friendly neigh-
borhood bar.”

(Emancipation has not yet gone
so far that a young woman can go
to a bar by herself without being
somewhat conspicuous; however,
two or three girls together are a
usual sight at these places.)

The bar has a relaxed, friendly,
cluhlike atmosphere where pitchers

of beer, a jukebox or group folk-
singing, informal clothes and in-
formal manners are the rule. in
these surroundings, any girl with
an ounce oi initiative should be able
to enginer a decorous pickup with
no trouble at all.

Ground Rules -

For the girl initiating her pro
gram, Dr. Ellis suggests a few
ground rules. No matter how charm-
ing or trustworthy he seems, she
should not immediately go to his
apartment or take him to hers. This
is carrying instant friendship too
far.

She should stick to somewhere
public and safe like a restaurant,
where she can sit and talk at leisure
as the two of them find out various
things about each other. if she still
feels that she’d like to see him
again, she can give him her tele-
phone number and address, so he
can take the initiative from then on.

Don't, he admonishes, chase him.
if she doesn’t want to see him again,
she can plead a previous engage-
ment when he suggests a date. And
if she has lnado an obvious mis-
take, she can give him a false phone
number and address.

and you have your own protection

are no longer sufficiently vigorous
to preserve the moral cohesion on

‘which the discipline oi free men

rests.

Although Dr. Gldeons was speak-
ing of the whole society, the point
has a very special pertinence for
that special society which we're
talking about — the University com-
munity. .

Precisely because our members
are intelligent, committed to the
use of intelligence and the exercise
of reason in the search for truth,
in the solution of problems, pre-
cisely for that reason we can_hope
reasonably to express our social
motivation in the improvement of
man's lot.

Responsibility of Choice

Precisely because we do 'share in
the unsettling dilemma oi the Uni-
versity we must describe its free-
dom andyour own in terms of‘ the
responsibility of’choice, the capa-
city ior self-control, the disoipline
of free men.

An early observer!” the Ameri-
can scene, DeTocqueville saw that
despotism may govern without faith,
but liberty can not. A free society,
and its opposite, cannot be distin-
guished by the absence oi authority
in one case, and its presence in the
other.

It is, rather, a question of inner
checks in the first case and ex-
ternal control in the other. This is
essentially a matter of moral com—
mitment on the part of the Univer-
sity and its members. A commit-
ment to the uses of intelligence in
the solution oi problems. A sense
of a common faith in the rational
process, a trust in each other
throughout our privileged commun-
ity; that we meet with this faith in
common, trusting, we can be free
with each other. ‘

Giving free access to the pursuit
of truth we can indeed be free. The
danger is every present because the
magic of the University community
is that it operates on the basis oi
mutual trust. It is fragile. it is very
easy indeed to destroy. Any fool can
shatter a crystal window and cry,
"See what powers I have I”

instrument, but adestructive one,
defeating its own intent. When the
methods of force, of physical mass,
of demagogary, of denial of the
rational process are employed in
the University, they will indeed
prevail, by destroying the essence
oi the University.

There is in every member of the
University community the capacity
for infinite sabotage through ignor-
ance or through intent they can
destroy.

Tragedy of Destruction

The tragedy oi the destruction
when it occurs is not primarily the
indignities on both sides of the con-
troversy whatever it may be. The
almost irreparable loss is the shat-
tering of the sense of the community
based on trust. The sense of faith
in each other, as men and women
dedicated to the fragile and enduring
ideals of the University. This is the
real- loss oi freedom — the denial oi
the opportunity for responsible
choice.

We too often think of the Univer-
sity only as a place of contemplation
and research and interpretation,
forgetting the impact of the support-
ing‘soclety upon the University, and
the University's impact upon” the
greater society.

Isolation

The Medieval University could in-
sulate and isolate itself from the
confused world around its walls.
Today's University cannot be sep-
arate from the society which sup-
ports it and which is shaped by it.

Indeed, the -members of the Uni-
versity, as I have indicated, are
those who have special motivation
as well as special talents for the
constructive attack upon the prob-
lelns of the larger community.

If the methods and the resources
of the University are indeed effec-
tive then the responsibility is clear:
to carry over the principle of ra-
tional analysis into an effective at-
tack upon the reai problems outside
the University's walls. When its
ideals are clear, when the Univer-
sity recognizes its own continuing
dilemma, when it is truly free, then
it can rise to the responsibility for
the attack upon these problems.

urday Review" is an essay adapted
from Saul Bellow’s speech accept-
ing the National Book Award for
his novel “Herzog.”

Bellow attacks the-critics who
attribute the p00r quality of con-
temporary fiction to the fact that
writers are' not alienated enough
from their society:

"The fact that there are so many
weak, poor, and boring stories and
novels written and published in
America has been ascribed by our
rebels to the horrible squareness
of our institutions, the idiocy of
power, the debasement of sexual
instincts, and the failure of writers
to be alienated.

Grlmy and Gritty

l"l‘he poems and novels of these
same rebellious spirits, and their
theoretical statements are grimy
and gritty and very boring too, be—
sides being nonsensical, and it is
evident now that polymorphous sex-
uality and vehement declarations of
alienation are not going to produce
great works of art either.”

Bellow's solution to the problem
is that the writer must think. While
alienation in the past has produced
some great works, it has outworn
its use to literature:

Novelist Must Think
“There is nothing left for us
novelists to do but think. For unless
we think, unless we make a clearer
estimate of our condition, we will
continue to write kid stuff, to fail
in our function: we will lack serious

 

CELIMENE,

in the April 3 issue of the "Set. '

vant. Here the critics must share
the blame. They 'too have failed to
describe the situation. Literature

source, its own province, has lived
upon its own traditions, and ac-

trangement from the common world.
This estrangement, though it pro-
duced some masterpieces, has by
now enfeebled literature.”

The trouble says Bellow is that
with the alienation comes the theory
of modern (decadent) civilization
which the artist cannot accept:

odcrri Civlllzotion

“The separatism of writers is
accompanied by the more or less
conscious acceptance of a theory
of modern civilization. This theory
says in effect that modern mossso-
ciety is frightful, brutal, hostile to
whatever is pure in the human spirit,
a waste land and a horror. To its
ugliness, its bureaucratic regi-
ments, its thefts, its lies, its wars,
and its cruelties, the artist can never
be reconciled.”

Artist's Duty

It is the artist’s duy, according
to Bellow, to think on his own, and
not necessarily subscribe to the
view held by his generation:

“This is one of the traditions on
which literature has lived uncrit-
lcally. But it is the task of artists
and critics in every generation to
look with their own eyes.

“Perhaps they will sec worse
evils, but they will at least be seeing

seemed to have the know-how which
was particularly noticeable in a
mmlc of this caliber.

Hollywood Sex Symbol

Finally, where she should be,
comes Carroll Baker. Hollywood's
newest schess?) symbol appears
on the screen as an indifferent ac-

In the entire film, Miss Baker
is not able to exude the sexual

necessary for an actress labeled

In Just. one scene Nancy Kovuck,
as a stripper interviewed by George
Maharls, is able to make Carroll

This is not the movie to bring
a ten-year old child to see, but on
