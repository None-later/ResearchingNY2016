‘Misanthrope’ Provides Poor Climax l'Ym Slur: Dab. Publishing Miami
To University’s Theatrical Season

by Bruce Daniels

The University Theatre's pro-
duction of Moiiere's ‘ 'Misanthrope"
seen last Friday and Saturday nights.
at PageJiali, was a fitting, iisome-
what flawed, farewell to Albany’s
current theatrical season.

Although Mollere seems to be
enjoying a "revival" of sorts (with
the New York production of “Tar-
tuiie” and a flurry of college pro-
ductions, including one at this year’s
Yale Drama Festival), "The Mis-
a'nthrope" rounds out a year of re-
markable variety in the University's
major presentations.

We have seen, in the space of a
few months, a striking demonstra-
tion of the possibilities of drama--
ranging rom the engrossing ritual-
play of "Dr. Faustus,"vthrough the
charming absurdities of "The Ti-
ger" and “The Typists" and the
highly successufl experimentallsm
of “Ethan Frome," back again to
an older, remoter form: the Classl-
cal French Comedy.

"Charley's Aunt?”

in the past,'Unlversity Theatre's
selection of plays has been criti-
cized on several counts —especial-
ly, that the plays are neither in-
teresting nor intelligible. The most
effective reply to this "criticism"
was made last year by the “Old
Piaygoers" who suggested, tongue-
in-cheek, that we ought to see more
oi things like "Charley's Aunt."
‘ The point, i hope, was well-taken:
that the most valuable service col-
legiate theatre can perform is to
expose us to new or unfamiliar
ways of looking at the world and at
ourselves through drama. it is cer-
tainly not to support us in our com-
fortable day-dreams or offer up a

“halo try .‘iuimltrcr

‘ lPilll..i'i‘l'l, FiillND OF the

'Missnthro e" Alceste, and

this reviewer with “graceful
cenidence.”

bland re-has of what passes, these
days, for entertainment. The fault,
dear playgoer, lies not in the plays
but in ourselves.

Excess oi Virtue

"The Mlsanthrope," it seems to
me, suffers from an excess of its
own virtue. Not content with merely
staging the play and simply giving
us the rare pportunlty to see it,
Wrector James Leonard seems to
have bent over backwards to avoid
making "The Misanthrope" a
“Charley's Aunt" type farce.

Called Moliere's most "serious"
comedy, “The Misantrhopat' shows
us a man raging against the hy-
pocrisy and back-biting of acorrupt
society. Alceste, the ,hero, is a man
too brutally frank to be tolerated by
the clever, superficial people around
him — but Mollere also takes great
care to show Alceste as an out-
rageous, grotesque figure. We are
ment to laught at him, but at the
same time feel the essential justice
of his ranting.

Alceste, then, is really two char-
acters: "Alceste One," the cham-
pion oi honesty, and"Alceste Two,"
who is something oi a monster,
someone to be ridiculed, a figure oi
'fun. it would take an actor of ex-
traordinary ability to mold the two
into one — as well as a director
who felt the audience was capable
oi swallowing more ambiguity oi
interpretation than Leonard has
given us.

Actions Speak Louder
Dimitri Perdnrls looked superbly
right as Alceste, moved and ges-
tured with professional assurance -
but whenever he opened his mouth,
he was not Alcoste; he sounded on-
tlrely too reasonable, too calla, too

dignified. At times, (the vehemencu
of Alceste’s language would ride
uncomfortably on top of l’ordnris’
confident manner. it seems that in
trying to capture “Alcosto One"
for the modern uudlonce, we lost
both.

As Celimonc, the delightfully un-
scrupulous coquotto loved by Al-
ceste, Anna Digncy was a little too
harsh and raucous to justify all
that attention paid her on the stage.
Celimeno could afford to be sweater
and more refined, but here again, it
seems that one aspect of character
was emphasized to the detriment of
the whole. .

Putnam's Periorinonco

’i‘ho liestlmrforlnalices were given
by Arthur Putnam (as Oronio, Al-
coute's fopplnh antagonist) and Lil-
lian Spamplnato (as Arsinuo, Coli-
mone's "friend" and rival). lioih,
of course, are caricatures, without
the depth of either Aiceato or Cell-
meno — but restful playing by Mr.
Putnam and Mills Spampinuto
:Jrou‘ght these cardboard characters
0 1

Charles liurtlett played Philinte
quite well, managing ()beitor than
anyone also, i thought to render
the heavily accented poetry ofiiit-h-
ard Wilbur's translation with grace-
ﬂtl confidence.

For much of the time, the actors
seemed to regard their lines with
vague distrust or cautious respect,
and, as a result, the rhythm and
rhyme of the verse-translation hung
over the performance like an un-
friendly outsider. Or else it drew
our attention from the play with n
distracting drone — a tedious exer-
cise in pure sound._

Ploy's Flow

The play as a whole suffered, i
think, from taking the current view
that “comedy is serious after all"
a bit too literally. By avoiding the
temptation to play Mollere for gags
alone, this production went too far
in the other direction — slowing.
down the pace and making "The
Misanthrope" a serious play with
extraneous touches of humor.

If we had only been allowed to
tear Alceste apart with laughter,
we would then have found our own
foibles unexpectedly exposed to crit-
icism. This is what comedy can do
for us at its best — and that is,
l'm afraid, what we missed.

Visually Mosteriul

Visually, “The Misanthrope" was
a masterful production. The cos-
tumes were a distinctasset,appeal-
ing to the eye and functioning well
in establishing the contrast in char-
acter (Celimene in the purest, most
ironic white; Alcesto in somber
uniasbionahlc black).

John Jay Moore's set was an elo-
gant but tastefully simple recreation
of French Neo-Classlc decor. More
than simply a realistic back drop, its
graceful, sweeping lines drew our
attention to the action and provided
the players with a perfect frame.

by Robert Judd and
Stuart Hem

The rapid decline in the popular-
ity of poetry, which has occasioned
much comment and concern in lit-
ersry circles and reviews through-
out the country, has apparently gone
unnoticed at State.

Harold NoakéETJr., in what must
be considered a daring publishing
adventure, has brought forth a book
of poems, “Young Sun," which
stands as a first step for Mr.Noskes
and perhaps as an inspiration for
other young posts.

The volume, slim by even poetic
standards, is handsomely printed
and is illustrated with pen and ink.
drawings by the author's brother.
Each illustration seems to echo a
dominant image pattern from apar-
ticular poem.

Romantic Themes

For the most part the poems are .

Romantic in theme and image, and
modern or semi-modern in diction
and prosody. When the combination
works successfully, the effect is
original and pleasing.

Many of the poems present a
Byronic face which often hampers
the real poetry which lies beneath.
Funeroal lyrics, they deal with the
traditional themes of the young:
fre'cdom, escape, death, death-in-
life, and the perennial pessimism
of the "human vomedy."

But the lack of human communi-
cation does not drive Noakes off
into the well-trod grounds of ex-
lstentialism, but turns him instead
to the well-trod grounds of R0-
manticism.

"Life can hold no more/ for my
heart" or "i, inwardly anguished,
scream at my chains/ and cry in
frustration" and “i will travel:/'
make myself drunk/ with seeing
foreign places" are modern echoes
of “Childe liul'old."

Grim Seriousness

vantage, but his grim seriousness
and lack of humor prevent the poems
from becoming more than personal
outburts.

When Noakes steps outside the
Romantic pass, his real talent can
be seen. I

His best poems, such as “Sonnet
on a Ship in the Mothball Fleet"'and
“Yes, Chaucer, Yes" are highly
struotured and unified by means of
rhyme, slant-rhyme, alliteration,
and repetition. RealizingthatNoakes
is capable of writing fine poetry,
one tends to ignore much of the
other spotty writing.

As poetry, the volume is a minor
success; as a publishing adventure,
we hope it is a. major success.

James Bond Fon i'lnds

Discrepancy in Article
To the Editors!

i believe i have found an error in
Mr. Epstein's article on James
Bond in the Friday, April 30 issue
of the ASP. He statd that Gold-
iinger instructed his hatchetman,
Oddjob, to break one of Bond’s
fingers. if one consults page 50 of
"Live and Let Die," it can be found
that the villain, Mr. Big, commanded
one of his cohorts,’l‘ec lies, to break
the pinkie of Bond's left hand.

Also, how does Mr. Epstein know
that Bond dies in Fleming's iinnl
James Bond mystery? Does he now
inside information? To the best of
my knowledge, the story is cur-
rently being published inthrcopnris
in "Playboy" magazine, only two
parts being on the market oi the
present time. Though 1 load totigi'cc
with this speculation, it is nothing
more than speculation — isn't it':)

i wholeheartedly agree with Mr.
Einstein's appraisal of 0. ii'. Hilul-
itng's “00'7 — James bond: A lin-
port." it is a must for all .hnnus
liond inns.

l nhnll look for a reply in n fuluro

“This is a day of happy recollec-
tion; the- University as a guardian
of tradition and a proclaimer of
heritage and exists for the future.
This building, room and ceremony
represent it,” said President Evan
it. Collins, during the flag cere-
mony held Friday at the new cam-
pus.

During the brief, simple cere-
mony, the ﬂags of the eleven Dutch
provinces and that of the city of
Nijmegen were presented to the
University. They will hang in the
Flag Room of the Dutch Quadrangle.

 

David Hartley, Dean of Students,
served as master of ceremonies.
He said that there is much signifi-
cance in the flag ceremony. As in-
dividual Americans, we are accused
of ignoring the past, but today we
are looking backward to the founders
of this area.”

"We are looking to a three hun-
dred your friendship that could have
been closer, except for late."

Maureen Giasheen, 1064 Tulip
Queen, also spoke briefly. She said,
“The flags are representative of
our Dutch past. They have double
