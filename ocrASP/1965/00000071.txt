SCOPE Recognition Withdrawal

MYSKANIA has l'ccolllnlended to
Central Council that recognition of
SCOPE be rescinded. The recom-
mendation was made Wednesday
night in response to a referral
made by Gary Lucznk, Frank Crow-
ley, Deborah i-‘riedlnull, Richard
Thompson, and Edward Bl'oval'ski.

The referral charged that SCOPE
had violated the provisions attached
to its initial recognition. Specifi-
cally, the provision cited was,“that
the activities ofille respresentatives
at this group shall not be con-
strued lll any manner as general

 

Editor Defends-Policy; 1
At MYSKANIA Hearing

MYSKANIA held an open hearing at 9 p.m. Monday

night in response to vcbonlcni student criticism of the 

1965 Torch. About 80 students attended the hearing to
voice thei ‘ approval or disapproval of the yearbook.
MOlldtly was the first day of official] distribution of the'
yearbook, and some 1100 copies had been given out.

Al Smith. who chaired
the meeting, explained that
its purpose was to allow
students to cxprcss their
views and to indicate
whether they felt that some
type of action against the
yearbook was \Vill“illllel.

Slnltll stated that MYSKANIA
would make some type of formal
l'eC’lillillelKlﬂllUllS to President Col-
lins if the bearing seemed to indi-
cate such a need. lie then opened

discussion to tile floor.
Individual comments on the book

.a .

g. . .. “cu, ' .
with “pictures un‘ihe point‘bf being '-

pornographic” to "reflects iile Un-
iversity more truly than any other
yearbook."

The dissatisfaction centered on
two or three major points. The first
and most discussed was the use of
the theme “A University on the
Make" and the “ovecolnlndullce”
of pictures of students “lllaking
out.” included if] this were com-
monts about captions used under
certain pictures, especially in the
Greek section, and about the
“double elltelldl'es” that allegedly
l'an throughout the copy.

Other students were displeased
with the choice of pictures and the
arrangement and amount of space
given to them. Several UlillSSlUilS of
activities or individuals were also
pointed to.

Reputation Damage

By far the most widely circulated
argument was that the yearbook
might damage the reputation of the
students or the school if used, as it
usually is, as n l‘Pifl'ulllllelll device
for prospective freshmen.

Other students, ill support of the
yearbook, claimed that its primary
purpose was not as :1 public rela-
tions tool, but us a recap of the
school’s people and activities.

William Colgnll, Editor-in-Chief
of the Torch, was present at the
hearing, and answered the charges.
llc defended his use of the (home
“A Universin on the Make" by
pointing out that the phrase has been
ill the AIllcl'icau vocabulary for many
years and was used by Woodrow
Wilson ill regard to the "middle-
class mun on the make" — trying
to rise in lhc world.

policy of the SUNYA, and further,
that representatives of this organ-
ization shall be representatives of
SCOPE only, and not of the SUNY
at Albany."

The group submitting the referral
also submitted two "exhibits." One
was a SCOPE flier which asked for
contributions to send students south
"to represent the SUNY at Albany,"
The other was aSCOPEbutton which
also has SUNYA printed on it.

MYSKANIA ruled that on the basis
of tllese exhibits, SCOPE could lll-
deed be “construed” to represent
State.

 

"Intellectual" Emphasized

'l‘lle yearbook theme, said Colgan'
attempts to portray “the University
trying to rise ill the world." lie
also answered charges that there
was too much of an emphasis on
studenls "making out" alld not
enough on the intellectual aspect of
the University by stating that by
actual number, only 3 out of more
than «100 cnlldids involved the for-
mer activity, willie there were many
plclurcs of students ill class and
studying on their own.

Finally, its stated that his pur-
pose ill editlng the yearbook was
“to portray the University as it is

and especially students asthe are."
or 

‘The discussion. was againppeued
to the ﬂoorfand while accusations
continued, several suggestions for
next year’s book were made. These
ranged from popular election of the
editor, to formulating definite guide-
lines nlld purposes for the editor to
conform to.

Slniill called the meeting to a
close at l0:30 p.1ll. Afterwards be
indicated that MYSKANIA would try
to take no immediate action of any
kind, but would continue to explore
the issue, and would discuss it with
President Collins.
