The weekend of May 8 and 9 was
witness to a triumph of Debate
Council. At that time the Council
managed to achieve two “Best
Speaker in Committee” awards at
the New York State Intercollegiate
Legislative Assembly.

This mock assembly is held in
Albany each year, and gives de-
baters from over twenty colleges
and universities in the state an op-
portunity to witnessthc accomplish-
ments of the New York State gov-
ernment.

Ira Rubtchinsky, a Senior and
past president of Debate Council,
and Harriet Tucker, :1 Junior and
present Vice President of theCoun-
oil were chosen by a secret bal-
loting oi the committee members
from twenty-four schools. “Best
Speaker” is based on a facilitation
to formulate and promote acceptance
of proposed legislation in commit-
tea.

The assembly, normally held at
the State Capitol, was moved to

- Chancellors Hall because of political

troubles in the State.

The topics of debate were Police
Rights vs. Suspect Rights;New York
Laws on Insanity; and New York
Laws on Censorship. Rubtchinsky
spoke on Police Rights and Censor-
ship, while Miss Tucker spoke on
New York Insanity Laws.

Albany will host the 1966 Legis-
lative Assembly. Miss Tucker will
chair the coordinating committee
for that event.

Faculty Members Express Views

Last Friday the Golden Eye Cof-
fee liouse held a discussion on civil
rights. Representing various views
on the problem were Mr. Reilly,
Dr. Wheeler, Miss lwanska, Miss
Shulz and Miss Newbold.

Miss Iwanska, Soeiology, com-
pared the denial of rights to Negros
to the Fascist rape of her homeland
and asked why there was no great
arousal of public sentiment. De-
scribing herself as a permanent
outsider, she questions whether so
many would stand idly by if rights
were being denied to a group of
White citizens.

Miss Newbold, History, described
past invastiuns of the Southby north—
erners and found that there was
adequate historical precedent to
point out that well meaning northern-
ers could accomplish adequate re-
sults in the deep south. She also
pointed out some of the negative
possibilities.

Northern Intervention
Miss Shulz, English, added that
northern intervention was one of
the few remaining means available
to attack the foundation of southern

power politics and political discrim-
ination.

During the open discussion which
followed the panel, it was pointed out
that the right to vote was the basic
right necessary if other needed rc-
fornrs in the field of equality are to
be brought about.

it was also pointed out that the
southern moderate has becntoolong
neglected and should, where pos-
sible, be brought into the struggle
for civil liberties.

SCOPE screening committee, rep-
resented the viewpoint ofthe SCOPE

Objections were made to Mr.

disruptive aspects such intervention
has on a community.

of fear of block voting by enfran-
