President in Position to View
Totality of Foreign Affairs

by Gary Luczcir

Woodrow Wilson once remarked
that the power of the President in
the realm of foreign affairs f'should
be absolute? The obvious rationale
behind this is simply that only the
President has complete access to the
findings of our world-wide intelli-
gence sources and to the advice and
concensus of expert advisers.

In short, only the Chief Executive
is in a position to see the totality of
a given situation and, with i do ex-
ception, he must be permitted to
take such actions as he shall deem
necessary for the protection oi
Ame ican interests. LyndonJohnson
has ertainly won ltls wings in this
realm.

New Foreign Policy Em

This column expressed confident
optimism upon the advent of the
“Great Society” that with few sot-
backs LBJ would fit all probability
get the major points in the Society's
program; but with regard to the
conduct of the country’s foreign re-
lations this optimism gave way to
uncertainty. At this writing, how-
ever, there is no doubt whatsoever
that Mr. Johnson has determined to
take the ball by the ltorns.

For such is the character of this
lie-nonsense gentleman that Amor-
ica's announced determination to
contain the Communist cholera and
squelch this monstrous threat to
mankind’s freedom is now proceed-
ing on a newly rocltaried course.

Dominican Action Justified

From the swift retaliation ordered
after the first Gulf ot‘Tottkln inci-
dent, thru the inauguration of daily
air-raids on tile Communist nupply
bastion in the North, to the recently
decisive action in Dullllillfifl, we are
witnessing the essential yot cautious
replacement of the Eisenhower-
Konnody hralul of wult-nnd-soopro-
priety with the LBJ mark of firm,

persistent initiative.

With regard to ’the recent action
in the Dominican Republic, there can
be little doubt, as the President in-
dicated 1at the-outset, that the land-
ing of U. S. Marines was designed
in fact to protect the thousands of
Americans and their property in a
territory where any basic semblance
of law and order had simply ceased
to operate. This is a legal right
guaranteed to all nations derived
from the bread-based precedent of
international law.

Prestlgo vs. Respect

However, as it became quite clear
that Connnunist elements had sig-
nificantly infiltrated the pro-Bosch
forces, the President relttforced
our garrison anti sought consulta-
tion with our American neighbors.
lly his speedy, no punches pulled
stand, Lyndon Johnson has ill all
probability fore-doomed tlto estab-
lishment of a second rad satellite
in our hemisphere and the possible
'rocurrencc of that ignotninlous
fiasco known as the "flay of Pigs."

Whenever one gets title it discus-
sion of United States foreign policy
nttd an analysis of the modus oper-
mtdl titeroof, someone invariably
raises the question of American
.“prostlge,” tlto nebulous facterthnt
figured so nobulously in the caut-
puign of 1960. Perhaps, though, we
are confusing "prestige" with "rc-
spoct." The Soviet Uitlott has the
world’s respect for its dedication
to its ideals ('2) nlid its strength;
and ttoi itecessni'ly in that order.

Subversion Is Aggression

Numerous Entries

  

‘With "the recommendation of the Athletic Advisory
Board and the endorsement of President Collins, the
Mascot-Nickname Committee announces the new mas-
cot of this University’s athletic teams: the Great Dane.

The .winning entry, was, submitted by Kathleen Earle,
a resident of Adams House.

The new mascot and the nickname, the “Danes,”
both representative of the grace, distinction, and
“strength” of the new university campus, were chosen
after careful consideration by two contest committees.

The first: committee, consisting of Mr. Burlingame,
Mr. Kirvo, Mrs. Moore, Mr. Bell, Stan Kerpel, Fred
Rawe, Bill Bate, Rick Genero, Udo Guddat. Joe Black-
man, Marium Tashjian, and Karen Bock. chairman,
disqualified itself because several of its members had

submitted entries.

They recommended that a second committee be
formed to survey the original entries. The second com~
mittee consisted of Maria Tucci. Vera Komanowski, Al
Smith, Bill Murphy, Bill Cleveland, Errol Fitzgerald,

Italian  mm as

‘ by Sue Yegcr, Times Union

Nothing gives me more pleasure
than to reverse an opinion I formed

two years back. At that time I

sadly reported that noted italian

soprano Renata Tabaldi's voice was
~ in serious decline. Her latest re-

cording reveals a total reversal:
the voice has regained former beauty
with a newly, attained richness and

V technical security. a

, Arias from Verdi

RENATA TEBALDI: Arias from
Verdi, Puccini, Ponchielli, Mascag-
hi and Cilea (London, in or 5, texts
included); With the velvet back in
her quality and ﬂexibility to make
the necessary quick adjustments in
such heavily dramatic arias as “Sul-
cidio’ ’ from Gioconda and “In Questa
Reggie” from Turandet, Miss Te-
baldi succeeds as few ever have in
wringing this music of its passion
and melodic splendor. Certainly she
again ranks at the top of today's
sopranes in "verisme" roles. (A
term used to describe italian op-
eras of a sensational, “Realistic”
type.)

Cheat Tones
Only occasionally does she drive
the top too hard and indulge a bit
too heavily in chest tones, the lat-
ter immensely effective despite
some impudent uses.

Digger O'Dolls

As if to show the bigger O’Dells,
of whom I was one, who said her
tone had become too weighty to sing
lyrically or attain top pitches, she
tosses off the lyrical “Segue di
.Doretta" from LARONDINE, taking
the high C's with surprising ease.

Perhaps, above all, it is the
honesty with which site interprets
that makes her voice so thrilling
and what site sings so meaningful
and satisfying.

April Release

With the April release of two
recordings by the lyric-coloratura
soprano Anna Moffo, the beautiful
young diva establishes herself as
an unubuaily versatile singer. Ex-
cepting Eileen 'Farrell, i know of
no other soprano so at ease in all
types of repertory (as evidenced
in her wide range of recordings
for RCA).

Lovely Musical Comedy

0n the first disc, Miss Moffo
sings a dozen lovely musical com-
edy favorites, many of which are
evocative of the Grace Moore and
Jeanette MacDonald repertory such
as “One Night of Love," “Italian
Street Song," “Kiss Me Again,”
“Stars in My Eyes," and “I’ll
See You Again.” All the songs are
given warm, romantic interpreta-
tions in her rich, hill-bodied voice
and occasionally she turns to seine
dazzling coloratura effects as in
“Love Is Where You Find It,“ pop-
ping off several high D’s. Her low
voice is surprisingly plush and se-
ductive. Henderson paces these un-
abashedly sentimental songs so as.
to give them new sparkle and no
one has ever sung them more beau-
tifully than Miss Moffo.

Rainer Godden Novel Turned into Movie;
Child Actors Make Result Warm, Tender

by Doug Rathgob

Delmar Daves' technicolor pro-
duction of “The Battle at the Villa
Flol‘iitn," adapted frolli the best-
sellhtg Rumor Goddcu novel, is a
fine movie, wnrtn, touching, and
funny. It was at tile Strand last week
as a sneak preview.

The flint, which stars Rossuno
llrnzzi, Maureen O’Hara, and three
delightful citlldrett, is about a wo-
man who leaves ltor husband attd
two early-teen children to run off
with a passionate italian musician
and live in his lush Italian villa.
Site has plans, you see, of happy
ever-altering with iter Romeo.

Children Follow Mother

The woman's ltushaud, played by
Riclutrd Todd, makes a feeble at-
tempt to make her stay with him,
but knowing he cannot keep her,
lets her go. The children, however,
are not so easily pushed out of her
life. They follow the lovers to the
little hideaway called the Villa Fl-
orltta, have seine humorous ex-
periences alou the way, pick up
a compatriot the musician’s own
daughter by his late wife) and pro-

ceed to raise hell in all effort to
get the mother hack to England
with dad, where she belongs. Hence
the "battle."

Scheme Follows! Scheme

it’s really a sort of heopelltan
“Parent Trap." Scheme follows
scheme, and it isn't too difficult to
figure out who's going to win front
the minttte the children decide to
do battle. The lovers find it's an
uphill battle all the way, and of
course, are doomed to lose frotn
the start..

Director Daves ("Pal‘i‘lsll,"
"Reine Adventure")hnndlestheiilnt
well with tile exception of the first
fifteen minutes or so. In trying to
find a proper way to start his tale,
and probably awed by the task of
transforming suclt a beautiful novel
oltto celluloid, Daves nearly ruins
the film trying to be "Arty." In
