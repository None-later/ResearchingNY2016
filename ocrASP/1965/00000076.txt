Statute Hampers

MYSKANIA has ruled “that SCOPE
has violated its organizational recog-
nition statute and has recommended
“that SCOPE's organizational recog-
nition be rescinded immediately.”

In so doing. MYSKANIA has not only
employed a ridiculously narrow inter-
,pretation of the statute, but has com-
pletely ignored the more important is-

sues involved here.

Under MYSKANIA’S interpretation,
SCOPE’s very existence on campus is
in violation of its recognition statute,
unless it avoids any attempt to identify
{itself as a unit operating on the SUNYA
campus. 1.; this case a much more ser-
ious error of improper identification

would be committed.

Council Action Called
Bad Policy Precedent

To the editors:

By .its refusal to take action
against the violations of Student
Association statutes by the repre-
sentatives of SCOPE on this cam-
pus, the Provisional Council has
set a precedent for the disregard
of laws and statutes of student gov-
ernment. _

The original statute of organiza-
tional recognition may nothave been
a good one. Perhaps SCOPE should
be allowed to use the name of the
University on its literature and but-
tons.

But the original stature was
passed and it is a law of Student
Association. SCOPE violated this
law by its use of buttons containing
the initials of the University. A
ruling by MYSKANIA stated that the
buttons were illegal.

Nonetheless, Provisional Council
refused to take action in the matter.
It has condoned a violation of law
by its inaction.

SCOPE has also been placed in a
difficult position by this failure to
set. It is now consciously, rather
than unconsciously, violating a
statute of S.A. SCOPE has no way
of knowing whether or not the new
Central Council will see fit to take
action against it.

To my mind, it would have been
better for all concered to with-
draw recognition from SCOPE so
that a new recognition statute could
be drawn up to correct the diffi-
culties which have been encountered.

I must take violent exception to
the remarks made by Mr. Mahay
condoning civil disobedience at the
Provisional Council meeting. Stu~
dents and citizens may have the
natural right and responsibility to
disobey laws which they consider
morally or practically wrong.

Governments, however, have an
even greater responsibility to en-
force the laws which they enact,
or to change these laws if they
prove unworkable. A society which
does not enforce its laws might as

well be an anarchy.

The examples he cited of civil
rights marches in the South are
more than invalid in that they ac-
tually suppost the opposite point of
view. Certainl, civil rights
marches have been held, but when
marchers have violated laws of
states or municipalities they have
been punished for it.

Some disuipllnary action should
be taken against SCOPE. it will be
up to Central Council to do this i
should also hope that the members
of Central Council will be wise
enough to change a law which has so
hampered the actions oi the former
government and SCOPE.

Senior Criticizes Yearbook
To the :dilors:

I would appreciate it if the fol-
lowing were printed. Your publica-
tion is the only means of redress
I see at present.

I am a member of the class of
1005, a senior. The annual year-
book, to a senior, should be a col-
lection of pleasant memories and
a record of what he or she has at-
tained during the four years at
State. According to this year’s edi»
tion of the Torch, Ido noteven exist.

My name and picture were left
out of the two honorarles to which
I belong, Signum Laudls and Kappa
Delta Epsilon. My other activity,
Draniatics Council, was left out en-
tirely, as was the entire speech
department.

My picture is in the senior sec-
tion but the wrong name is under
it, and i am IlOl listed in the senior
directory at the end.

Much will undoubtedly be said
by other parties of the general tone
and nature of this year's “Torch.”
I will content myself with saying
that it is apparent that Mr. Colgan
and his staff should have spent less
time preparing their smuity "0n
the Make" joke and more time in
their true function of preparing an
accurate record of university life.
Perhaps than I would have had some
memento of my university career.

Torch Cited For Realistic
Portrayal of University

To the Editors:

1 would like to speak out for the
1965 edition of the "Torch." i feel
that for the first time someone has
shown the courage to portray Albany
and Albany State just as it exists
for us all everyday.

The “Torch” shows the beauty
and splendor of Albany and of State
as well as their lowliness. It shows
all of us the reason we are here:
to gain an education and intellectual
enlightenment, so that we may climb
out of the filth and common-place-
ness that surrounds us here at Al-
bany.

Granted, the “Torch” is slanted
towards the seamy side of college
life, but is it not the way we live,‘
whether we admit it or not. i feel
that it portrays Albany as it is and
from where it must climb if we are
to attain our goals andobjectives for
which we came to Albany.

I think the reason why so many
people are upset by this publication
is that, for the first time, it brings
before us the stark realism of what
we have become, this generation of
hypo c r i t i c a l, pleasure-seeking
peoples.

The “Torch” has kicked out from
under us the "ivory Tower” that
our mediocrity has built for us.
The “Torch” has brought us face
to face with the facts with which we
must live, The way of life we fos~
ter and condoneJ Foster and condone
by our indifference, our apathy, and
our common-placeness.

look, fellow students, look hard
at yourselves. Hate it, detest it, but
above all learn and grow byii. Grow
and develop your bodies and minds,
in yourselves and YOUR University
a way of life for which you can be
proud, not a way of life that brings
cries of discontent and hatred when
you are put face to face with your-
selves.

My hat goes off to Bill Colgan
and the courage he has shown in
presenting this year's “Torch,”

'  Group ‘FreedOm

“We should allow free-
dom to students to organ-
ize for any legal purpose,
so long as they identify
themselves properly."
This was Dr. collins initial
comment in regard to the
issue of SCOPE recogni-
tion.

The question was raised as the
weekly press conference with ASP
and WSUA. Dr. Collins felt that
SCOPE was not in the wrong in
identifying itself as a unit at SUNYA
since “SCOPE has student built
into the title."

Discussion on the yearbook took
up a major portion of the 50 min-
ute conference. Dr. Collins judged
it "technically a fine job" but with
"outstanding photography marred
by bad taste." He indicated that the
yearbook “must represent the stan-
dards of the student body" and that
he did not feel that this has been
done.

Asked if he would take action
against the yearbook if MYSKANIA
or some other group made such a
recommendation, he stated, "lwould

effect to assure that SCOPE's policies prefer to have the students take
would not be attributed to the general
student body. The Council came close man anyone,”he continued. Hewent
to denying recognition completely.
There can be no half-way point be-

The matter of appropriating
money for the Statesman was dis-
cussed. Recently, Provisional Coun-
cii voted to appropriate money for
the Statesman to .appear at the
World's Fair. A similar appropria-
tion was made last year.

Student Association funds were
also used to purchase the States-
men's blazers. This year the point
was raised that the statesmen are
not part of Student Association, but
rather are organized asanon-cred-
it course under the department of
music.

statesmen Expenses

Council members questioned why
the University did not pay States-
men’s expenses. At the press con-
ference Dr. Collins explained that
the University had been approached
for the money the previous year,
and had promised it iistudent Asso-
ciation was unwilling to pay the ex-
penses.

This year ur. Peterson, who di-
rects the statesmen, came directly
to Provisional Council. ‘Council ap-
propriated the money this year with
the stipulation that it was to be used
only if the University refused to
assume the costs.

Bruce Daniels and Bob Judd, edi-
tors of "Primer," have announced
that Sam Cypressi and Bill Murdick

buted articles to "Counterpoint" and
worked for "Primer" this year.

Chairman Mahay Gives Address

Art Johnston claimed the distinction of being the last
of a species. If that is so, I guess I’m one ofa kind.

Art said “Damn Tradition,” and we sure did a good
job of it. We were a student government on the make,
and now we’re made.

Now that tradition is damned andstudent government
is made, it's time to lookvery seriously into the future,
to see what Provisional Council has given this student
body to work with. We have a Constitution, which will
allow the students, if they use a little initiative, to be—
come at least as liberal as the administration. This
Constitution is so constructed as to give the authority
for the legislative and executive powers to those who
best know how to use them, the members of the organ-
izations themselves.

This delegation of authority will allow Central Coun—
oil to concern itself with such things as Faculty-Student
relations, relations between the University community
and the World in which it exists, student freedoms.
and an opportunity for all students to express their
ideas and opinions and see them at work.

Now that we are in our 20th year of transition,i
feel that we have reached its high point in the area
of Student Government. Student Government is now
in new hands under a radically new system. The re-
sponsibility is yours now.

will pilot next year's issue.

After their appointment as co-
editors, Cypressi and Murdick out-
lined their plans for next year. They
said that they hoped to get an office
in Brubacher Hall.

They indicated that if they had
an office students would know where
to go to bring their articles. Now
the editors receive very few ar-
ticles from the outside because of
the magazine’s uncertain location.

With an office more articles would
be submitted enabling them to pub-
lish two issues a year and eventually
to publish quarterly.

Also included in their plans was
to do away with the magazine’s
photography and art and replace it
with faculty fiction. This they feel
should be part of a college literary
magazine.

Murdick explained that he had
looked through several college mag-
azines and compared them to
“Primer.” He said that he received
many ideas from these publications
and that in the future he is optimis—
tic about setting up a circulation
exchange department with colleges.

Both Murdick and Cypressi are
English majors. They both contri-

May had been invited to
speak here by the Free-
dom Council as a follow-

up to Miss Judy ,Wells, 8'

VISTA recruiter who spoke
to a group on campus about
two months ago.

At that time about six preliminary
applications had been submitted by
State students. May received several
more applications after his speech.

‘Poverty' Unknown

May related that only five years
ago when he had quit a well-paying
private welfare job to work for the
federal government’s War on Pov-
erty, the word ‘poverty', to desig-
nate the existing condition of al-
most 35 million Americans, was
all but unknown in the language.

Today, the problem is realized
and admitted by almost every man,
woman, and child in the countrv.

Today the American college stu-
dent, with the rest of the country,
has become aware of the problems
of the country around him.

'Ncw' Poor

VISTA, according to the speech,
is here to help the ‘new’ poor of
the 1960’s, instead of the old poor
of the 1930's. The poor man of the
1930’s was usually poor just because
of the dearth of employment due to
the Depreseion.

Today's poor are the uneducated,
the unknowing, who need outside help
because of lack of even basic skills
or knowledge. These include mem-
bers of minority groups, such as
Negroes, Mexican-Americans and
Indians, unskilled Americans, who
have been thrown out of work through
automation, school dropouts, and
lastly; the children of the poor, who
make up over 15 million ofthe stan-
dard figure of 35 million poor.

So far 18,000 young Americans
have volunteered for service in
VISTA. By the end of this summer
2000 of them will be in the field.
Mr. May mentioned that VISTA vol-
unteers are sent only to work on
projects where they have been in-
vited by local groups.

Expenses Pold

VISTA Volunteers are paid room
and board, travel and medical ex-
penses, and $2.50 per day for per-
sonal expenses. In addition, they
receive a lump sum of $600 dollars
at the end of the year of service.
Unlike the Peace Corps, VISTA
Voluntech serve only one year
terms. Anyone eighteen years old
or over is eligible.

Interested students can inquire
by sending a letter to: VISTA, Of-
[ice ofEcononiic Opportunity, Wash-
ington, D. C.

Notification takes two weeks from
application to acceptance illlll volun-
teers can still apply for work this
summer, as well as for any future
date.
