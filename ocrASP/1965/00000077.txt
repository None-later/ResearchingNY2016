i n lulique softball game held
on Saturday, May 15, on University
Field, the State team of Bob Hart,
Wayne Smith, Jim Loudis, and Dick
Griffo scored 14-6 win over a Stone
0-man team. ‘

Tile game was played before ap-
proximately 250 cheering and highly
partisan fans.

The Albany men positioned them-
selves as pitcher, catcher, and a
player between first and second
and a player between second and
third.

Bob Hart, SLS’s phenomenal pit-
cher during the AMIA softball sea-
son, hurled a fine game. Any hit
to the outfield by a Siena player
was, as a rllle, a home run.

The State team scored first in
the bottom of the second inning
when Hart walked, stole second,
and scored on a fly ball by Smith
that the Stone right-fielder caught
in foul territory.

Slena bounced back for three runs
in the top of the third, but the four-
man team evened the score with
the aid of a home run by Grille and
heads-up base running by Loudls.

Siena posted three more runs in
the fourth frame to take a seam-
ingly comfortable lead.

Smith hit a three-run home run
in the bottom half of the inning to
even the score, and added runs in
the filth, sixth, and seventh to win
the game.

Ill order to support these stu-

collected.

The rully will cup two months of
activity by the controversial organ-
ization. SCOPE hns been criticized
for “misrepresentlug” itself as
speaking for the entire University.

to portray llsolf us nl'epl'esontntive
