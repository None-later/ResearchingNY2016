We are glad to see the revival of a
fall orientation program for freshmen
which is currently being ’formulated
(see pg. 2). The degree of participation
by this year’s freshman class in student
activities has shown the obvious need

  

for such a program.

The Summer Planning Conference,
which has replaced Frosh Weekend as
the initial orientation device for fresh-
men is a decided improvement over the
old system. Yet some type of continuing
activity, planned especially for‘the needs
of incoming freshmen is needed in the

first few weeks of the fall.

Thus far the committee has rejected
the idea of a return to Rivalry on a
f man-sophomore competitive basis.

19 the Editors:

While it is not my purpose to
comment on ' ‘ ex-
pressed liy Mr. Gary Luczak in his
article in ioreign aiiairs (ASP, May
14, 1965, p. 6), I should like to
point out that some oi the facts
presented in regard to the crisis in
the Dominican Republic are erron-
eous and would appear to be based
on wishful thinking.

Contrary to what he writes, there
is a great deal oi doubt that the
landing oi U. S. troops was at any
time designed to protect American
citizens, the original excuse ior the
operation, which became shy-prod-
uct. .

In iact, the troops were landed
when the pro-Bosch elements were
on the verge oi victory, and, in the
words oi Captain James A. Dare,

1965, p. 10).

Since the U. S. had already decided
that the pro-Bosch elements were
"r. . . . . . ... (l mgmy
debatable issue), this meant that the
U. S. was backing the pro-military
dictatorship elements.

Neither has it been demonstrated
that "it is quite clear that Com-
munist elements had signiﬁcantly
iniiltrated the pro-Bosch iorces."
In tact, N. Y. Times, CBS, and Latin
American correspondents have
iound no evidence oi this being the
case to this day.

Similar conclusions have been ex-
pressed by Canada’s Prime Minister
Lester Pearson and by former Do-
minican Secret Police Chiei Es-

We hope that the committees in charge
of this program will give serious thought

which helped to foster class identity.

Whatever they come up with, we urge
the upperclassmen to give it .their en-
thusiastic support.

They hope to include the whole Univer—
sity. We would agree that some aspects
of the old Rivalry were undesirable and
should not be revived. .
The idea of a class competition should
not be completely rejected, however.
There is an interest, incentive, andfocus J

is hard to find when we are all working

abroad. I would like to know what
those "broad-based precedents"
are.

According to the well-knowntrea-
ties on International Law by L.
Oppenheim, ioreign nationals with-
out diplomatic status are not entitled
to special protection not given to the
general population.

They are only entitled to equa
treatment and their country oi origin
may make diplomatic representation
ii discrimination is charged. Let me
state that I am not opposed to
humanitarian rescue operations,
provided that such remains the sole
purpose oi the military action; but
international law does not lustiiy
them. Nor am I opposed to military
operations necessary to safeguard
U. S. security, but I do not think this
was the case here.
