tions.

It is- pointless to blame Cdm-
munist subversion for the revolt
'in the Dominican Republic. The re-
volt was born out of genuine dis-
content with both the oppressive
policy of the military junta and
frustration with the seemingly hope-
less socio-economic conditions of

the populace.

The Alliance for Progress has
thus far had very little progress in
this country, and if the United States.
continues to engage in armed inter.-
vention, the word "alliance" might

also be dropped.

If we and our allies “who count?"
know that our cause is just, is it
wise to demonstrate our convic-
tions on national sovereignty by
unilateral intervention? This policy

verges on the Machiavelian.

Monolithic Conspiracy?

Senator Fulbright oiArkansashas
warned against the fallaclous as-
sumption that the communist block
is a monolithic conspiracy. That
the United States is acting on this

erroneous belief has been proved
by its actions in the Dominican Re-
public.

lt is time to stop deluding our-
selves. All too often the Com-
munists have succeeded in iden-
tifying their cause with nationalism.
The United States, acting on the
basis of this false assumption, has
failed where the Communists have
succeeded.

Now it is time to take a hard
look at the consequences of Ameri-
can policy. If those who took part

in the revolt now turn to the Soviet _

Union, it will be because the Ameri-
can action has left them little, if
any, alternative.

The unjustifiable actions of the
United States will do little to fur-
ther the cause oi world peace. in-
stead, they will uniiy our enemies
and divide our allies. .

Before we “go all the way with
LBJ," let’s ask ourselves, where
are we going?

There is no question of prestige
involved in the intervention. There
is, however, a 'serious question oi m“
American words vs. American ac-

From Dissatisfied Student

To the Editors:

Despite the fact that so many of
our State students do not consider
our yearbook worth having, (one girl
told me that it could have signifi-
cance to about 15 people at most)l
have been unable to obtain one of
the thirty-three hundred copies
which were ordered this year. in
view oi this, 1 would like to make
a plea to the twenty-two some odd
hundred people who do not‘ wish to
keep their copies:

“Dear disillusioned students,
please, deny yourselves the drama
oi righteously tossing your copies
into the waste basket, tacking the
‘offensive' pictures on local bulle-
tin bosrds, purging the pages by
fire and the like. lwouid like to
obtain two copies. 1 would greatly
appreciate your sending your vio-
lently unwanted copies to the News
Office in Brubacher Hall.

Thank you for your time and

Student Cites Torch Furor

As Typical 'Babbitt' Reaction
To the Editor...’

The recent hysterial outburst over
the 1965 Torch and its alleged im-
morality and bad taste is just one
more tiresome example of what can
happen when our “leaders of to-
morrow” take themselves too ser-
'iously.

Every campus in the country must
be plagued with its share of
"wheels" who, if given at least the
nominal responsibility to govern,
will go to insane lengths to emulate
and please the elders.

The same psychology that oper-
ates with grade-school students cor-
recing each other’s papers (they will
tear each other to pieces, thinking
that this is what the teachers wants

to? see), prompted some good lad or

The image is too delicious: our
future Bebbltts drooling“ over each
"suggestive"_ line or picture, chuck-
ing and smirking with self-satis-
faction at each new purient possi-
bility. Our "nature leaders" have
their sick side, too, as well as
being honestly misdirected toward
"doing the right thing."

Our University, if it is to achieve
“greatness” (s laughable goal any-
way, for overnight) or at least a
solid and commendable identity,
must do much more than move out
of the old dorms and into the new.

A University. is not a public re-
lations picture oi gleaming white
buildings and 'vast expanses - but
a community attitude. An attitude
more open, honestly critical and
cosmopolitan than the “critics” of
the yearbook have shownHVe must
move out oi this narrow-minded-
ness and into the clear air oi a
University.

The recommendations oi MYS-

permanent board of censorship for

'llaring’ Records

by Jim Schrcler

Virgil Thompson, composer and
critic, wrote in a recent article
that America has "A very inei‘fl-
cient and retarded recording in-
dustry." Some items from recent
German and English catalogs, how-
ever, show European recordings
only more “daring” than the Amer-
ican counterparts.

“Carmina Burnnn" means Carl
Orii. Well, it did mean Carl Orff
until Teleilmken's Das Alte Werke
issued selections from the 13th
century anthology, now in Munich’s
Bavarian State Library. Extensive
German notes deal with related
literature, culture, the instruments
and the manuscript. While Orfftries

Last Sunday, Trinity Methodist
Church had a concertof choral
music, interpretative dance,,and
choric speech that proved to be a
worthy event spiritually as well as
culturally. » .

The first Trinity “Festival of
the Arts” continues all this week
with an art show, and a second

concert featuring music for brass,

and organ, which will be held next
Sunday.

The chorus, conducted by David
Tate, performed works of Bach,
Thompson, and Hovhaness. The
speech choir was directed by Dr.
Frances Colby of our English De-
partment, and resd‘selections from
T. S. Eliot’s "The Rock," while
the Dance Group swayed imagina-
tively on the altar.

Mrs. lda Gilman, the choreog-
rapher for the numbers,then danced
a solo while the speech chorus re-
cited a “Canticle of st. Francis."

The dance group and the chorus
combined to perform John Dlercks'
-motet “Clap Your Hands, All Ye
People."

Imaginative Festival

The people at the church deserve splring oils or water colors of '

a great deal of credit for the imag-
inativeness and the enthusiasm with
which the entire program was car-
ried, but beyond this, it was grat-
ifying to note that there were many
points that one could praise.

The liovhaness Motets which led
off the concert were done in a
stringent style that suited these
plain—chant sounding works quite
well.

Appropriate Cantata
The Chorus also did Bach's“Cnn-

fection on one side.

Unfortunately this does not do-

album SLPM 138-955.

National Trademarks

All English recordings are dis-
torted in the inner grooves. This is
their national tradesmnrk. "Les
Editions de L’Olsenu-Lyre" fea-
tures authentic performances, such
as the nee album of Victoria Motets
and Masses, including “0 Magnum

The most interesting
part of the program, however, I I
the, performance of the. readings
ii 'm the Eliot poem. The choreog
raphy of Mrs. Gilman was perhaps.
a bit obvious, but it was enthralling.
to see the girls raising from the
alter floor of the "Creation", sway-
ing back to back to symbolise the
union of the body and the soul,
raising their :arms and legs toward
the vaulted ceiling ofTrinity Church
to gather in the illumining "bright-
ness" of the spirit.

Art Show Disappointing
One wishes that the art show
were as successful as the concert;
however, with a few exceptions,
what we are given is the Warner
Sallman type of portrait of Christ,.
(complete with blue eyes onacouple
of occasions) and pretty but unin-

churches.

A couple of these are worthy,
however, as they seem to have an
appropriate my‘ tlcal sense behind
them. One such is 'a remarkable tem-
pera of the garden of Eden which
more resembles the bleakness of s
battle field.

Another is an interesting collage
crucifix made from glass, which in
addition to an incomplete figure-
(only head, hands, and feet), not
many Christian symbols integrated
into the piece.

Next Week's Concert
The Art show can be seen any
day this week between 2 and 4 p.m.,
or at night from 7 to 9 p.m. Next
Sunday, at 4 p.m., the concert of
music for brass and organ will be
performed. A number of late ren-
aissance works will be done which
are rarely heard in Albany, and if
they are performed with the same
reverence and feeling as were the
works on last Sunday's program,
it will be a program not to be

missed. ‘

Hopefully, other churches in the
area will be able topi'esentthis type
of program for the Albany com-
muulty. The public is, of course,
invited to the concert at Trinity,
and a voluntary offering will betaan
to help defray the costs of the
festival.

Machiavelli’s Views in ‘The Prince’

by Lar. y Epstein

the name Niccolo Machin-
velli and there is an automatic
montul equation made with “The
Prince." Few people, however, nro
able to oquute the play "The Mar
rirngolu" with Machiavelli.

The play is about u seduction. A
young mun, Cnllimnco, seeks Lu-
crezln, wife of that foolish wise
man, Mossur Nlclu.

Say

Tricks and Bribes

’l‘o ntiniu his goal, Calllmnco
drops nll pretense of bumun (io-
ccncy. Through the help of Ligurio,
it local lmuvc, Caliimnco, uses a
variety of tricks und bribes to on-
snnre the aid of Sostrntu, Lucre-
zlu's mother, Friar Timoteo, Lu-
cl'cziu's confessor, by fur the most
intcrnsting obnl'ncter of the piny,
mui Messor Nlcia.

’l‘no licentious plot mnkos inter-
esting reading, and serves as tho
illustrative example oiMnchinvelll-
on philosophy as it was manifested
in “The Prince" and greatly ex-
pended in "The Discourses." The
question the play ruises is, "Can
a virtuous girl remain virtuous?"
Machiavelli's answer is a hard,
stoney, resounding “No.”

lnilnlto Morality
Even the good in our world have
their price. Mnohiavsili throws-out
infinite Morality as being meaning-
less and out of place in our world.

Friar ’I'lmoioo is "The Prince"
in Monk's clothing. lie is cold,
realistic and not quite aware of
his shortcomings. lie embodies the
situation a human being faces. That
is, while there is a common will
which binds people together, there
are personal needs. 'l‘lmoleo looks
and sees what is needed, judges the
good against the bud, somewhat
reminiscent of Utillturinnism but
with much more cunning.

Ethics Suporiluous
Cullimucn finds himself in u sil-
untiun where he discovers some—
tblng that ho cunnol live without,
and proceeds to disrugnrd ellllcii,
which seem superfluous, to got what
he wants.

Mucltlnvulli wustcs no lines to
any what he wants and to provoke
laughter. Noplllluﬁuplty l5 expounded
in the pluyonihosm'fuco-nu solitary
figure snunlors to the middle of the
stage and announces: "the world
sinks. Do what's best for you and
disregard all thetenchings ofChris-
tiunity."

liui subtly throughout, Machiavelli
knows the human condition. No
honest man would dare call him a
liar. One cannot even any be was an
stlueist, although he did say no
divine grace tempers the cold reality
of everyday life, Machiavelli sees
the practicality oireligldn and would
not be above using it to good advan-
tage against an adversary.

Man is Bose

Machiavelli, in cwuiensed form,
then, felt (1) man is base and often
stupid. An intelligent man realizes
this and will take advantage by
manipulntion of [be stupid fools of
society to carry out his wishes and
(2) man does not change. lie is bad
and will always remain bad.

“The Mumlragoln" has received
its share of critical ntientlon. Many
critirs, wlnle noting the general
lnnnornillty of the play, cannot deny
the comic genius and the true ﬂair
for ulnu'uiel'lzntiml.

’l‘. li. Mucuuluy said “The Man-
drngoln" is superior to the best
of Goldoni and inferior only to the
bent of Molierc."

“What Men Do"

Francis Bacon said: “We are
beholden to Machiavelli and writers
of that kind who openly and un-
musked declare whut men do in
inct, and not what they ought todo.’[.

Stuart says “Of the cynical im-
morality oi these situations the
less said the better, but neverthe—
less these scenes strike a note
never board it l’lautus. They give
an opportunity for dramatic pro.
grossion. '

T. S. Eliot felt that “Mashh-
volli was no fanatic; he moral)
