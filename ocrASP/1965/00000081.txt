 RayView 'of Sports

‘ O
by Roy McCloot

Well. it’s all over but the shouting. As we bring
down the curtain on the last “RayView of Sports” of
the year. several important things remain to be done.
Before we do that, it’s time to dispense with this “we”
jazz and personalize this column. My staff has received
enough blame for thoughts expressed under “we” in
this space.

A very sincere “thank you" to my staff of writers,
photographers and paste-up gals for the wonderful
help you’ve given me in the past year. Without you,
while the. rest of the paper came out semi-weekly,
we'd have been publishing weekly!

Thanks also to the coaches and managers for all
the lines of copy you’ve given us; “never let it be said
at the State University of New York at Albany that
sports news was hard to come by.” (Joe Garcia. Bill
Schieffelin, “Doc” Sauers, Keith Munsey, B'ob Burling-
ame, Merlin Hathaway.et.al.,on numerous occasions).

Thank you, too, fans, for the sporadic, occasionally
enthusiastic support you gave our athletes during the
past season. (Oh. come on now. you all remember the
Buffalo game, don’t you? Without you, all this was still
possible.

And lastly, a most sincere thanks to the athletes of
the various sports. 1 must admit, though, that without
you my job would be a lot easier. but an awful lot
duller. Seriously. believe it or not, athletics do have
fa. fine tradition at State, and you fellows are the reason
or it.

it is customary at this point for the sports editor to
name his successor and claim that the new sports
editor has “more potential than the present one."
Sorry, you’re stuck with me for another year.

What’s in store for the sports department? Well, we
are starting to think of new headlines for the Danes.
How about, "The DANES ARE GREAT." Well, it's
better than "The PEDS ARE DEAD.”

Next year, when i’m out of the clutches of a phys.
ed. instructor, the pros (’2) and cons of physical ed-
ucation will be aired thoroughly. it is not a healthy
situation as it stands now, and almost everyone agrees
that something must be done about it. Let’s hope that
something is accomplished early next year.

That's it for a your, fans. it has been enjoyable.
