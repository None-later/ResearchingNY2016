Drs. F iser, Thorne Accept Positions
As University’s New Vice Presidents

The University enters
the 1965-66 academic
year buttressed by the
creation of two new vice
president positions.

Dr. Webb S. Fiser, recently a
professor of political science at
the University’s Graduate School
of Public Affairs, has been ap-
pointed vice president for aca-
demic affairs. Dr. Clifton C.
Thorne, who was appointed dean
of students on July 1, was elevated
to vice president for student af-
fairs.

Both appointments were made
by Dr. Evan R. Collins, president
of the University, following ap-
proval by the State University
Board of Trustees.

Expanded Roles

In his new position, Dr. Fiser
will coordinate all academic mat-
ters at the growing University

Center. Dr. Thorne will be re-
sponsible for all student living
affairs.

These newly-created positions
represent important revisions in
tiie University’s administrative
set-up. Both vicepresidencies will
bear more prestige and enipioy a
larger role than the positions of
Dean of Students and Dean of Acu-

Dr. Fiser
...Vice President of
Academic Aiiairs

of New York highlighted

v\institution.

 He began with a short
w‘elcome of the Class of
1969, and went on to call
the University’s New
Campus a symbol of
change which will move
the University “towards
becoming a major educa—
tional and research cen-
ter."

He then discussed the reason
for the university and its duty
towards the student.

University's Existence

Gould called the existence of
the university a “major bastion
against ignorance and the well-
spring of ideas by which civiliza-
tion progresses."

“In a democratic society we are
committed to the belief that a
university should be free and un-
trammeled in its explorations and
that the shadow of thought control
should never touch it.

"Adherence to this principle is
the best guarantee we have of the
preservation and nurture of our
democratic ideals."

He said that auniversity’s major
responsibility to the student is to
prepare him for the "sharing of
the passion and action of our time
and to place you (the student)
squarely in the midst of both even
while you are students.

Preparation for Life

“A university education is not
merely preparation for life; it is
life itself."

lie called the student the “se-
lected, and ultimately the educated,
core of our society and our hope
for leadership in all aspects of
life."

Gould said that it is the function
of the university to bring about an
awareness in the student. This is
done through the classroom, per-

President Samuel Gould of the State UniVersity

olurity

Tuesday’s All-University

Convocation with a keynote address entitled “The
Student and the University.” In the speech he dis-
cussed the intellectual life of the University and
how he hopes it will influence the student and the

sotinel interrelationships with
other students and teachers and
campus social events.

“If the rigiit right formulas
have been used which include suit—
able proportions ofencouragement
and pressure, the correct balance
between subject matter and judg-
ments, the proper amount of as-
sistance coupled with a judicious
amount of aloofness when the stu-
dent tends to become dependent,
the skill amalgamation of the con-
temporary and the constant —
given all this, a mature, inde-
pendent, individualized person
should emerge.”

Aware of Responsibility

This mature person is aware of
his responsibility and has “an un-
ending curiosity leading to serious
scholarship."

He is a person who knows the
value of' privacy: Gould said“that
the “real test of the educated man
is what he can find to do when he
is left to his own device with no
gadgets to help him."

Still another eleinentof maturity
