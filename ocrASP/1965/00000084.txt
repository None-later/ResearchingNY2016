with their academic adviser.

Rotate in Group Events

In the evening, and for the next
day, the freshmen were divided
into three groups, each partici-
pating in the three major events
of the Conference. The first event
vincluded individual appointments in
Draper Hall.

Each,freshman had anindividual
appointment with his academic ad-
vlsor, where he arranged his
courses for the fall semester and
talked with his adviser about aca-
demic problems. .

In addition, freshmen were able
to request appointments with the
housing office, financial aids, med-
ical office, and counselingservice.
Identification pictures and cards
were also processed at this time.

During the free time between
appointments the freshmen toured

Summer conference
Receives Praises
illillass of ’69

Change, challenge, and
confidence — these three
words, according to eval—
uations, spell for many
freshmen the meaning of
the Summer Planning
Conference,

nn m

At the end of each of the eight
sessions, the freshmen were given
the opportunity to rate every as-
pact of the Conference, from aca-
demic advisement to registration.

Additional space was provided
for written criticism on the mast
and least helpful aspects of the
Conference.

The purpose or such a detailed
evaluation was to gather freshman
criticism and comment of the suc-
cess and shortcomings of the con-
ference. These evaluations will be
used to further improve each suc-
ceeding conference.

The overall rating of the confer-
ence itself was high. Of the 1261
freshmen who completed the eval-
uation forms, 88.5% rated the con—
ference as “excellent” or “very
good."

Excess of Lectures

The next highest rating was re-
Celved by the individual academic
advisement appointments, which
87.7% of the freshmen thought were
excellent or very good.

Probably the most common crit-
lcism of the conference was that
there were “too many lectures."
The opening convocation, for ex-
ample, received the lowest per-
cent of excellent and very good
ratings (39.5%), but 43.7% of the
freshmen found it “satisfactory.”

Talks on the new student gov-
ernment and residence-hall liv-
ing were fairly well received.
« The ll‘OBh enjoyed the tour of
the new campus, but when (lis-
cuasing the campus itself, they
voiced mixed emotions. One “Red
DonI" complained that therewere
"too many trees" on the New
Campus.

Tuition Fees for Flowerpot!
Another had the following com-
ment to make: “Least helpful

_, was the new campus tour. While

It was very interesting, it showed
me that my tuition fee of $400
might possibly be used for a $316
flowerpot, which is indeed aggra-
vating and stupid."

Each evening the freshmen met
in small co-ed discussion groups.
The disCussiona were led by the

Recreation '
On the second evening, the fresh-
men participated in a social-rec-
reational period. Activities in-
cluded volleyball, football, bad-
minton, folk-singing, or just get-
ting acquainted.

The third morning was taken u
with the completion of question?
naires, registration forms, and an
evaluation of the SPC.

No matter what the_scheduled
,event, the main activity of the
Conference was talk. In meetings,
between meetings, at meals, in
the halls, with roommates and
with advisers, there was a con-
stant flow of questions, answers,
information and advice.

A third group was given a tour

GROUP DISCUSSIONS PROVIDED a prime opportunity for freshmen to ask questions and express

opinions. The rapid
know their fellow classmates.

S.P.C. Emphasiles Scholastic
Responsibilities, Freedoms

"Welcome to Albany’s
community of scholars.
No matter what you
thought of yourself be-
fore, here at Albany we
think and assume that you
are a person who is com-
ing to college to learn.”

With these words at the Opening
Convocation, Dr. Howard Maxwell,
Director of ‘ “ ‘ A: ‘ ‘,
set the tone for the Summer Plan-
ning Conference.

From the very beginning of the
conference, the freshmen were
treated as scholars. Each activity
was geared to acquaint them with
the freedoms and responsibilities
of a scholar in an academic com-
munity. " r 4 v

Individual Freedoms

"The freedoms that you will ex-
perience can be a misleading drug
and will prove to be your most
valuable lesson of the freshman
year,” continued Dr. Maxwell.
"The test of real maturity will be
the use of this freedom with re-
sponslbllity.

“The student remembers that
he is here in college to make of
himself all that he is capable of
becoming. He has an obligation to
his family, state, and nation, as
well as to himself, to take advan-
tage of the educational opportun-
ities that are available here at
the University."

Dr. Morris, who spoke to the
group earlier, outlined the re-
sponsibility which the University
felt in helping students to achieve
this feeling of community.

"The State University of New
York at Albany is committed to the
elimination of those causes which
tend to annihilate the feeling of
personal worth on the part of the
individual," he said.

“You will find that almost all
members of this faculty, adminis-
tration, student affairs staff, resi-
dence hall directors, and resident
assistants are ready, willing, and
able to discuss any matter of per-
sonal concern to you at any time."

University Extends Help

Dr. Maxwell also spoke of the
University's willingness to extend
aid, especially in regard to the
University College. "We are ex-
perienced in helping freshmen
through a year that will prove to
be exciting and at times difficult.
I think you will find that we can
be of great help to you, but you
must let us know when you do
need help."

This responsibility of the fresh-
man to take the initiative was
emphasized by Richard Thompson,
Chairman of Central Council, in
his explanation of the student gov-
ernment structure.

“Through the Central Council-
Commisslen form of government,
the causes of individual discontent
can hopefully be eliminated. But
it depends upon your support and

your involvement in the govern-
ment.

"Your primary concern is aca-
demic achievement. But there is
much to be gained from the many
activities and programs available
here. If you are to fully develop
your potential, I feel.it is neces-
sary that you seek out the avenue
which can best fulfill your needs."

The emphasis on individual re-
sponsibility carried throughout the
three-day program. It also formed
the of the -- ' " wre-
marks of Dr. Morris.

“You are to be congratulated on
your demonstrated intellectual
ability. Your records are of high
caliber — You have the ability to
do the work here — there is no
doubt about this fact.

“You will get out of your col-
legiate education as much as you
put into it. However, as many
phase of a person's life, you will
only get from your collegiate edu-
cation in proportion to that which
you give to it..”

Parents’ Brief Orientation Includes
Convocation, Reception, Campus Tour

Parents who brought
their childrentothe Sum-
mer Planning Conference
received their own orien-
tation to Albany State. A

convocation, reception,
and tour of the New Cam-
pus provided a brief but
important introduction of
what to expect in the next
four years.

  

At the convocation both Dr. Clif-
ton C. Thorne, Dean of Students,
and Dr. Robert B. Morris, Dean
of the University College, talked
with the parents. They explained
the purposes and activities of the
Summer Planning Conference and
introduced several of the academic
advisors and other administration.

The emphasis, however, was on
the changes which the student would
experience in both his social and
academic life, changes which the
parents should expect and be pre-
pared for.

"This is a time when students’
ideas change. This is normal,”
said Dr. Thorne. "It is a time
when the desire for independence
is strongest. This causes prob-
lems for you parents and for the
University, but this must happen
if these students are to grow."

Parents were urged to “cut the
umbilical cord new," to “let them
go, but encourage, support them."
They were reminded that in col-
lege students should have~respon-
sibility for their financial affairs
and social lives as well as their

academic work.

Dr. Morris talked with the par-
ents at length about probable
changes in ucademicperiormance.
"Parents have observed their
young people climb to the top of
the academic ladder and are proud
of the academic achievements ob-
tained by their children... But here
in the Class of 1969, there will be
many such prize scholars."

“You should not expect too much
of your son or daughter, particu-
larly during the freshman year.
The competition is going to be
keen and many students will learn
the meaning of study for the first
time."

No Report Cards

ilo emphasized the fact that the
University would not send grade
reports to the parents but urged
"that you maintain close contact
with your students.

“Some students will fall, of
course,” he said, "but it is the
Job of the University and the par-
ents to provide the support so that
