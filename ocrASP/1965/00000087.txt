line Party Government by neiault " t

In Albany as in the rest of New York
State, there are four recognized and
legal political parties: Republican, Dem-
ocrat, Liberal and Conservative. Unlike
most of the state, there is only one party
which is alive. This is the Democratic
party. .

The Albany party is often maligned
with statements of ingrained corruption,
police brutality, and blackmail. All three
are either believed or rejected by most
people. We are not in this category.

We feel that police brutality is an
occasional occurrence in Albany as it is
in any village, town or city. We have
never heard of any case where a police-
man has been convicted of brutality. We
feel this is due more to our definition of
what constitutes brutality than any at-
tempt by any policeman to brutalize
anyone.

We feel that in this case Albany is
certainly no worse than any other sig-
nificant center of population. Indeed,
the fact that the local police seem to
know a great number of the people they
deal with indicates that brutality would
be very unlikely.

if there are cases of actual brutality,
they would involve Albany’s growing
Negro minority, There have been period-
ic assertions by Negroes andcivil rights
advocates that brutality is a common
thing. Again it seems to be a matter of
definition.

We would like to see a tightening of
the definition of brutality. This does
not mean that a policeman should be
attacked or beaten before he can re—
taliate. it does mean that the best legal
defense (that of an attack) is not always
needed.

Blackmail is a hopeless charge. There
has never been a conviction of anyone
for political blackmail. The threat of a
rise in assessments seems to be largely
a thing of the past. The further back
in time assessment juggling gets, the
more extensive it seems to have been.

As for corruption, there seems to be
only one case worth any merit. This
would be the series of doubtful cir-
cumstances surrounding the purchasing
practises of the city and the county.

The opponents of the O’Connell ma—
chine have never been able to produce
substantive evidence of any widespread
or politically based corruption.

The people of Albany are pleased with
their government. No better evidence
could be hadthan the primary victory
of Senator Julian B. Erway over in-
surgent Joseph McCormack. The mar-
gin was many to one.

Despite all this, we continue to have
four parties in Albany. The Liberal

party is apparently Owned and operated
by the Democratic party. We can find
no instance when the Liberal nomina-
tion did not go to the Democrat.

The Conservative party offers no op-
portunity for change. The Conservatives
deem interested only in controlling the
Republicans. In Albany, the Republican
party does not seem worth controlling.

This brings us to the crucial issue:
the Republican party. There are candi-
dates, there is a party organization on
paper, and there is an occasional party
worker.

This is the extent of the Albany Re-
publican party. It offers no sincere or
genuine opposition. Every fourth year,
the Republicans come up with a can-
didate for Mayor.

The current Republican candidate is
a good example of Albany Republican-
ism. Jacob Olshansky, their candidate,
is well-known, respected man who ob—
viously has no desire to be mayor and
not intention of doing anything effective
to become mayor. There has been no
campaign to speak of. We have had a
slip-shod “whitepaper” on Albany’s
water supply.

in a year when Mayor Corning is not
seeking another term (he is after his
sixth term in November) there is no
visible Republican party.

The idea of a responsible opposition
seems to be totally foreign to the local
Republican party. The result of this is
that the people interested in change have
largely given up on the Republican party
and have applied their half—hearted ef-
fort to the Democrats,

Albany is one of the few places in the
state where a vote for the minority
party is a complete waste of time.

on the Map

The presence ofState University Pres—
ident Samuel B. Gould on campus last
week is indicative ofseveral good things.

First, we have a president who is
both willing and able to speak to his
own students. For two years we had no
president at all. This may contribute a
halo effect, but we are sure that what
we are seeing is real.

President Gould is an able and dy-
namic individual. lie has a flair for
solid ideas and precise thought. These
abilities, together with his policy of
being a visible president, have had the
effect of placing the State University
on the map.

For years the press treated the State
University as an accident of the 1948
legislature. This attitude has been de-
stroyed, largely thanks to Dr. Gould.

 

by Joseph VI. Golu '

One week ago today was primary
day. In Albany the Democrats had
contests for members of assembly,
state senator, alderman, and ward
supervisor. The Republicans had a
contest for member of assembly
and a'contest for state senator in
two Albany towns.

This writer was able to observe
the process of voting in Albany
last Tuesday. The situation of my
observance was the 14th ward,eiec-
tion districts five and six. .

These E.D.’s have their polling
place at the fire alarm building on
Delaware Avenue.

Atmosphere

The day was dominated by a
feeling of calm. The insurgents
had no poll watchers in either dis-
trict polling place. The regulars
sat around the table greeting their
friends and talking over who moved
and who was sick or recovered.

Nicholas Sacca, the ward leader,
wandered through all of his eight
election districts. Mrs. Sacca, who
has a memory that notices sVery-
thing and forgets nothing, remained
at the fifth E.D.

A5 each voter came in, he or she
was greeted by name by either one
of the election workers or Mrs.
Sacco. Unlimited instruction was
available before the ballot was given.

This instruction was needed since
the voting was on paper ballots.

The ballots were handled Indi-
vidually. First the identification
numbers were torn from the top of
the ballot. Then the ballot was
folded one last time as it was
placed in the ballot box. In no case
did any voter do any ofihese actions
himself.

In short everything was done as
required by the state's election law.

Counting
Once the balloting was over, the
counting began. Sacca and other
party regulars collected the figures
at their headquarters in the Eastern
Star Hall on Lark Street.

The phone rang and Sacca would
answer by announcing hlslast name.
The figures would come in and they
would he placed in the columns on
his tally sheet.

The percentage turned in for in-

cumbeul. Senator Julian Erway ran 3
as high as 07. The overall percen-

tage for the 14th ward was 92.27% .
for Erway. The ward contained one '
that was involved in the i
Lifsel-llarder race. 87% Voted for ‘

Once his figures were completed,

everyone said goodbye to those not
going to the party headquarters

downtown. Those leaving included
(ix-Assemblyman Jack Hayes, who,
feeling the cfibcts of age, missed
his first election night at head-
quarters in forty years.

The trip to headquarters is a
brief one since it is in the State
Bank of Albany building on the
ninth floor. -

Headquarters for the Democrats
is basically three rooms.. The lar-
gsst holds a television, two desks,
many chairs, and all those not tab-
ulating figures.

Mayor Corning, Assemblyman:
Frank Cox, Senator Erway, Assam-
blyman Harvey Lifset, ex-Senaior
Peter D'Alessandro, and several
others, including judges and other
ward chairmen, stood around watch-
ing Mayor Corning's televised news
conference.

The mood was mixed. Some were
jubilant over the percentages; others
were disappointed either at the small
turnout or the inability of ihelnsur-
gents to put up a good fight.

There were very few traces of
a political meeting. Most of the
ward leaders were too tired to do
much shouting.

Sacca summed. up the situation
when he said, “It’s all hard work.”
The results were clear — percen-
tages of 92 and 87.

Student Inducted

An Albany State student has suc-
cessfully completed the Peace CUl‘jis

New General Studies Program

To Serve Part-time Students

During this fall semester, the
University initiated a new program
designed to provide qualified men
and women, who are beyond the
normal college age or who are un-
able to attend college during the
day, with the opportunity to continue
or resume collegiate study leading
to a degree.

Credits earned in the "Program
in General Studies” can be trans-
ferred to the several schools or

‘Help’: Rousing Comedy

by Douglas Rolhgch

The gentleman known as John
Lennon, Paul McCartney, George
Harrison, and Richard Starkey...
er, Ringo Starr, known collectively
as The Beatles, are rapidly be-
coming Crown Princes (M.B.E.,
remember?) of that zany, frenetic
brand of comedy associated with
the Marx Brothers, to whom the
boys have so often been compared.

Their latest romp into the realm
of the absurd, appropriately en-
titled “Helpl” is surely one ofthe
most outrageous film farces in
recent memory. Even the antics
of British comic Peter Sellers
in "Pink Panther” and “Shot in
the Dark” mustbe considered mild
compared to what the Liverpool
four come up with.

In their first film success, “A
Hard Day's Night," all they had to
contend with were their mobs of
screeching fans. Now, in “lielpl”
things get a bit tougher because
Ringo happens to be wearing (for
a reason which is not explained)
the sacrificial ring of the great
Goddess Kalli, and therefore must
be sacrificed, according to the
custom of a way-out Far Eastern
religious cult.

High Priest

The members of this cull, led
by their High Priest (played by
Leo McKern), chase the Beatles
from London to the Swiss Alps,
to Salisbury Plain near Stone-
henge, and finally to the Bahamas,
in an effort to regain the huge,
red-stoned ring, and, of course,
to do in Ringo.

Though the Bontlos' first color
film Sports a low dull spots, and
though on a number of occasions
the boys" Liverpool dialects be-
come incomprehensible, most of
“llelp’s” ninety minutes are im-
aginative and wildly funny. [is in
"Hard Day’s Night" much of the
background music is provided by
the Beatles' laicsl hit songs, such
as “ilelpi”, l‘The Night Before,"
"I Need You," “You’ve Got to
Hide Your Love Away," “Another
Girl" and "You're Gonna Loss
That Girl," all written by Mo-
Cartney and Lennon.

Madcap Situations
Even if you don’t Iikethe Beatles
themselves, you'll find it verydif-
flcuit to keep from laughing at the
many madcap situations that arise

in the movie. A number of for-
instances: the boys, trying to find
a safe spot to hold a recording
session, and up on Britain’sSaiis-
bury Plain surrounded by a pro-
tective force of British Centurion
tanks.

But as they sing first "I Need
You," and then “The Night Be—
fore“ out there in the middle of
nowhere, the iligh Priest of Kalli
and his “army” meanwhile set off
:1 TNT charge under the ground
near them, overrun their pro-
tectors, and nearly finish off the
Beatles as the sound-track blasts
out the triumphant finals to the
“1812 Overture."

Alps and Field

On another occasion the boys
"fool around” in the snow—covered
Alps in a riotous scene reminis-
cent ol' that mad romp in the open
field in “Hard Day’s Night.”

“Help!” has pi'oven not only
that the Beatles are among the
best non-actors in the actinghusi-
ncss, but also, and more impor-
tantly, that they are not just a
“flash in the pan.” They are un-
doubtedly here to stay, like it or
not.

One of the reasons why they are
can be attributed to the efforts of
Richard Lester, who directed both
their films, as well as the recent
Rita Tushingham smash, "The
Knack...And How to Get It."

Lester's free-wheeling, imag-
inative, creative direction can be
thanked for a good deal of the
spontaneity, quickness, and with
that abounds in "ilelpl" Lester
somehow miraculously manages
to keep the film in a stale of con-
trolled confusion-methodical mad-
Hess, so to speak.

Fres-lor-AII

Under the control of a lesser
directorial talent, “llalpl” might
have come out as a garblodhodgo-
nudge oi slapstick and sight gags.
liut as it happens, it emerges a
beautifully controlled fi'ec-for-all
well-organized pandemonium.

Will Ringo end up on the God-
dess Kaili's sacrifice table? Will
the power-crazy mad scientists
win out in the and? Will John live
to sleep in his pit again? Will
Paul ever be reunited with his
electric organ? "lieipl" holds
the answers, and the fun.

colleges in the University.

The purpose of the program is to
bring the resources of the Univer-
sity to the special publics of the
region.

The curriculum is open to those
who wish to complete ageneral pro-
gram leading to a degree or those
who have no desire to secure a
degree but who want to improve
their occupational competency.

Students, who have been dismissed
from the University or another col-
lege because of academic reasons,
may be admitted to the program
after one calendar year has elapsed
since dismissal.

Mitchell Trio

The Mitchell Trio has made up-
pearances in such TV shows as the
“Ed Sullivan Show,” "Hullabaloo,"
“The Tonight Show,” and many
others.

Owing to their unique talent, the
Trio spent fifteen weeks touring
Latin America under the auspices
of the President’s special inter-
national program for cultural pres»
entaiicn, which is a project of the
United States State Department.

The boys, in collaboration with
famous musical director Milt Okun,
arrange their materials in a fresh,
distinctive way that has served to
make them a vital part of the folk
and popular music world in just a
few short years.

 

,Ind discussion of "Religion in
America" in Channlng Hall ended a
seven day long orientation program
for State’s 35 new foreign students.
The discussion was sponsored by

y‘tho Campus Ministry.

Miss Helen N. Mayo, foreign stu-
dent advisor at SUNYA arranged
the program beginning with a test
of English for all new foreign stu-
.dents.

The group was welcomed at a'

luncheon at the Dutch Quadrangle
by President Evan R. Collins. Dr.
DcWiti Clinton Ellinwood, profes-
sor of history, spoke on the topic,

- “ Freedom, Its Meaning." This was

followed by a tea for the students,
their guides, and faculty in Bru.

The students were given tours of
the present academic complex, the
new campus, downtown Alba y in-
cluding the State Office Building,
the State Education Building and the
State Capitol, and area sights in-
cluding Schuyler Mansion and the
Albany Institute of History and Art.

Theatre

which "everyone has a right to be
excited," according to Mr. Leonard.
The prestige which the University
has gained from the new ANTA
office, as well as the New York
State Community Theatre Associa-
tion headquarters, will contribute,
he feels, to a more stimulating and
worthwhile program here.

Leonard adds that "Of Mice and
Men," topically related as it is to
present questions of poverty and
mental reiardaiions, makes an ex-
cellent first production for the 1965-
1960 season.

NROTC

Applications are now available
for the Naval Reserve Officer Traln-
ing Corps qualification test. The
test will be given December 11,
1965, and is' open to all male high
school graduates between the ages
of 17 and 21.

The test, as well as personal in-
terviews and medical examinations,
will be used in selecting 1600 men
to become mldshipmen in NROTC
units. These men will be given col-
lege educations at 52 colleges and
universities throughout the country.
Registration for the test will close
November 19.

During his college training, the
candidate takes three summer
cruises with various naval units.
