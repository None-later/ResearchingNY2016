Six Areo Colleges
Sponsor Seminar
0n lotin America

at Albany, together with five other
area colleges, will sponsor a sem-
inar on Latin American relations
with the United States.

The seminar will begin Monday,
September 2'7. The program's eleven
meetings will be held on the Union
College Campus.

Besides Union and SUNYA the
sponsoring colleges include Stone,
the College of St. Rose, Russell
Sage, and Skidmore.

Specialists from different parts
of the United States who will speak
at the seminar include Dexter Per-
kins, an authority on the Monroe
Doctrine; Dana Munro, a specialist
on United States relations with the
Caribbean; and Arthur Whitaker,
author of a book on Argentina.

Also speaking will be llerbert
Matthews, Latin American special-
ist on the editorial board of the
New York Times; and Charles Brin-
ckerhoff, chairman oi the Anaconda
Company.

changes in Soviet industrial organi-
zation and management policies."

On accepting the scroll of honor
presented to him by Hideo Tone-
mura, President oi Japan’s S.A.M.
and Japanese Board Chairman for
Esso, Dr. Mossin gave a talk en-
titled "The Decline of Authoritar-
ian Organization and Management
in the Soviet Union."

Professor Mossin discussed the
transition from Marxist philoso-
phies pertaining to bureaucratic
ministers and managerial powers
which are causing Soviet mana-
gerial policies to become analageus
to the Free World.

He explained that the Soviet change
in policy was made inevitable by
the mid-century technological revo-
lution which caused the formation
of a more sophisticated technology,
economy, and work consumingpopu-
lation. This, plus the fact that ac-
cording io the Soviet Economist
Abel Aganbegyan, the economic
growth rate has fallen by two thirds
in the last six years, spurred the
change.

In 1959-Soviet Economics Profes-
sor Evsey Liberman first proposed
his ideas to vest capitalistic like
managerial autonomy to individual
enterprises and introduce a profit
incentive and indexes which would
measure enterprise oefftciency.

He felt that this would motivate
enterprise directors by greater
freedom of management and in profit

sharing. in 1962 rhe'Soviets imple-
mented two experimental enter-
prises along Liberman’s plan and
later two hundred more.

Dr. Mossin pointed out that the
pressure of economic demoraliza-
tion and industrial chaos plus the
fact that the Russian workers are
now more educated people looking
for realization of promise in their
industrial system will not be easily
suppressed by reactionaries push-
ing for perpetuation of discredited
Marxist policies.

Dr. Mossin concluded his talk by
explaining the real significance of
the Liberman proposals. One of
these is the fact that years of Soviet
Experimentation with a bureaucratic
method of management have been,in
effect, surpassed by the Free Mar-
ket System. The second being a re-
vealing of a ferment in the Soviet
power structure. A reappraisal of
the tyrannical dogma has probably
marked the turning point ofenchant-
merit with Marx. Finally, the Russian
people will have an opening for free
inquiry, humane economic progress,
and advancing personal security in
peaceful cooperation with other na-
tions of the same values.

Dr. Mossin is also a member of
the Hudson Valley Chapter of the
Society for the AdvancementofMan-
ligament and has Just returned from
a world trip, and he is interested
in starting a SAM in liong Kong.
