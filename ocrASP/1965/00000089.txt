Speech Department Announces
Change ill Course Requirement

Dr. Paul Bruce Pettit, Chairman
of the Department of Speech and
Dramatic Art, has announced the
adoption of an Alternate Placement
Program for the fulfilling of the
speech requirement.

The program which begins this
semester allows the student to ful-
fill his speech requirement by taking
one of the following courses:
Speech 1 (Fundamentals of Speech),
Speech 4 (Argumentation and De-
bate), Speech 9 (Public Speaking),or
Speech 16 (Group Discussion). Pre-
viously all students were required
to take Speech 1.

Students with unusual facility our:
experience in speech may be totally
exempted from the speech require-
ment. Students with serious diffi-
culties in speech may meet their
rlahuirement by consistent partici-
pation on the program of the Uni-
versity Speech Clinic.

The placement program permits
all freshmen and under-classmen
transfers to enroll ill a first or
second semester Speech 1 section.
Upperclassmen transfers with an
unfulfilled speech requirements are
assigned to first or second semester
Speech 9 section.

The instructor evaluates the stu-
dent's performance after three or
four sessions of the class. If it is
thought that the student would profit
from enrolling ill another course
ill the alternate placement group,
his name is submitted to the Alter-
nate Placement Committee.

Dr. Richard Wilkie is chairman
of this committee. The committee's
recommendations will be based on

the student’s educational and pro-
fessional objectives, as well as the
desires of the student.
Consent Required

No student is moved to another
course without his consent. The
Chairman of the department must
approve the committee’s recom-
mendations before registration with
various administrative offices can
take place.

Editor's Note: Ths’tollowlng Is
the complete tour of the speech
given by Prolldont Samuel D.
Gould ol State University ol New
York at tho All-University Con-
vocation on Soptomllor 14.

it is a great pleasure for me to
join in this colorful and impressive
occasion and to add my word of
welcome to those already offered
you.

The great new campus presently
emerging as the home for the State
University at Albany is far more
than a symbol of physical growth.
It represents in a much more im-
portant way tho change this institu-
tion is now undergoing as it moves
toward becoming amajor education-
al and research center for the Uni-
versity as a whole. Its undergraduate
concerns will now be more and
more augmented by graduate and
professional work. The splendid
record of this campus in the past
will stand it in good stead as it
now increases and expands its re-
sponsibility. T have every confi-
dence in the leadership of your
president, in the faculty, and in
the students as you all shoulder
your share of such responsibility.
1 wish you all well as the academic
year begins and pledge you my
complete and enthusiastic support.

Tonight I should like to talk about
something that reaches to the heart
of your reasons for being here. I
should like you to consider with me
the intellectual life of this campus
community and what we hope it will
bring about both for yourselves and
for the institution you cherish.

Of course, it is a dangerous un-
dertaking these days to discuss in-
tellectual life at all. As a nation
we show too many signs of placing
intellectualism and subversiveness
hand in hand. it seems impossible
to convince some people (all too
many people) that one can love his
country deeply, be proud of its his-
tory and achievements, be ready to
give his life for it, and still be
critical when it falls short of its
ideals or its promise. There seems
to be some mysterious comfort for
us to keep repeating to ourselves
like Candide that we are the great-

 

out of ll] possible bowl
beat of all possible worlds - v '

Yet in our heartswe know the ..

  
 

we must give our very life blood, 

if necessary, to protect the com-f

pleteness of the freedom by which
a university ﬂourishes and achieves
excellence. And we know, also, that
we must think carefully about the
elements of freedom and how we
use those elements, lest we find
ourselves guilty of equating free-
dom with' irresponsibility and thus
indulging ourselves and encouraging
others in license.

We cannot emphasize too often
these days the necessity for com-
plete and absolute academic free-
dom for the scholar and a similar
sense of freedom for the lay citi-
zen. We live in a time when the
clash of ideologies has shaken the
foundations of our constitutional be-
liefs insisted upon and defended so
fiercely by Jefferson and his con-
temporaries as well as by many
statesmen of modern times. Every
decade has brought forth crises that
challenge these beliefs, that tempt
us, perhaps in the interests of tem-
porary peace of mind, to relinguish
a small portion of our freedom to
believe or to discuss or to explore.
Ultra-liberals and arch-reaction-
aries, alike, representing opposite
poles of political and social philos-
ophy, steadily test our willingness
to adhere to the madamental prin-
ciples of the Bill of Rights. It does
not matter that some aspects of the
philosophies of these people may
be repugnant to us as individuals.
Under such circumstances we can-
not afford ‘to forget that the denial
of this freedom to any person ulti-
mately threatens the freedom of
all of us. If we believe in excel-
lence, we cannot and must lloi per-
mit any corrosion of the spirit of
inquiry as a value in the free world
and most particularly in America.

The fact that as students you are
faced now with the ever-present
danger of becoming intellectuals,
should cause us to take some no-
tice of why we bother to fight for
the continued existence of educa-
tional institutions in this country
in view of the sinister reputations
we are prone to acquit. It is to

simultaneously matures as anin-
titution. _

To put the matter simply and
frankly in regard to the first ques-
tion, we are concerned about the
existence of the university because
it.is.the malol' bastion against ig-
norance and the wellspring of ideas
by which civilization progresses.
In a democratic society we are
committed to the belief that a uni-
versity should be free and untram-
meled in its explorations and that
the shadow of thought control should
never touch it. Adherence to this
principle is the best guarantee we
have of the preservation and nurture
of our democratic ideals.

In its purposes and programs a
university is a combination of the
timeless and timely. The timeless

 

 

elements, deeply rooted in the lib- “1”” development >
You should remember that even
though students like yourselves in
colleges and universities of this
and through the ﬁrm “cannon a, land are counted in the millions,
you still represent little more than

oral arts and humanities, achieve
fruition through a dynamic perpet-
uation of the classical tradition

those aspects of learning that are
linked to the identification and
strengthening of humane values.Tho
timely elements reflect the impacts
of contemporary society and the
necessity for preparing youth to
meet the urgencies of human need,
both present and future, whether
philosophical, social, scientific, or
technological. They reflect also the
constant and ever-pressing demand
that man's knowledge be increased,
and, as i said a moment ago, that
freedom in the search for truth be
zealously guarded.

A university motivated to such
action and dedicated to such prin-
ciples is a priceless attribute of
our society. All of us should never
forget what a power for goodls here
represented, and therefore how es-
sential it is that we champion its
continuation enthusiastically. The
first lesson of a student is to learn
and learn well the nature of the in-
institutidn to which he belongs. He
cannot help thereafter but be proud
of his membership in the univer-
sity and eager to mature under its
