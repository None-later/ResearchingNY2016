OOPS!  Not Agoinl

Pnoi Planning

A time of transition is, in theory, a
time of planning. Unfortunately this is
not always the same. The library is an
example of good planning. The change
'over to the Library of Congress system
of cataloging books comes at a good
time. To wait until we are on the new
campus would be to compound the job
and the confusion;

The move of Financial Aids from
Draper to the Air Force ROTC is an
example of bungling.

The situation of their new offices is
remote from this campus and especially
remote from the people who need their
services the most. The average person
needing financial aid is less likely to
have a car than an average student.

The reason or reasons for the move
are, no doubt, the usual series of gen—
eralizations. We would like to hear an
excuse for the debacle from whoever
let this happen.

Sales Tax

If there is one issue that will domin-
ate the November election, it will be
the popularity of the new state sales tax.

This tax is obviously the result of a
deal between New York City's outgoing
mayor and New York's ever-smiling.
still blintz-eating. governor.

The sales tax is wildly inconsistent.
Text books. as we now know, are tax-
able: while magazines are not. No in-
dustry is satisfied with the definition of

taxable consumable supplies and the def-
inition of non-taxable construction or
improvement materials. There are many
other examples.

We feel the greatest injustice is being
done to the person collecting and billing
the tax. Every merchant dealing with
taxable goods is now a New York State
tax collector. Each must spend countless
hours working for Nelson A. Rockefeller
without the benefit of the minimum wage.

The State itself is unsure as to what it
means by taxable and non-taxable items.
The State Tax Department cannot answer
many of the questions it is being asked.
The ASP would like to know if we have
to bill our advertisers with the sales tax
included.

We were exempt from the federal ex-
cise tax because we were considered an
educational institution. Whether the state
will let us continue in this status is still
up in the air.

We’d like to find out. It may mean a
major change in our budget if we must
charge the tax. If we end up having to
pay the tax, things could change radically.

We are not the only organization which
is unsure of its status regarding the tax.
Business in Albany and the rest of the
state often find themselves in the posi»
tion we are in.

We feel that since the state has been
ur'iable to do a competent job of extend-
ing this tax the state should adopt a meth-
od of taxation which it can handle. with—
out drafting every merchant into a spe-
cial army of Rocky’s tax collectors.

land last semester. This property
will be used for recreational pur-
poses. The exact-use of this pro-
perty is largely, up to the students.

Several students have already
started working o'n this new land
to prepare it for future student use.
During this past summer a student
crew helped to change this meadow
and woodland into suitable land for
picnics, excursions, and some out-
door sports.

, Student Workers V

The students involved in the slun-
mer work were Edward Noonan,
Walt Decker, Daniel Burgess, Ray-
mond Allen, Joseph Mahay, John
Sturtevant, Richard Siscanass,
Charles Davis, and George Drew.

With the purpose in mind of using
this land for picnic and sports ac-
tivity the stulients cleared some
sections of the area. They bull
several stone fireplaces along the
lake shore and others in a cleared
woodland area.

Some woodland plots have

The students did not do any car-
pentry work on the farmhouse be--
cause carpenters were hired to do
this task. The carpenters are now
repairing the roof of the farmhouse.
Once this job is finished, the work
on the inside will begin.

Work Discontinued
Although much work has been done
this summer, the area will not be
open for student use until proper
facilities are installed. Activity has

Dippikill, Jehnston PrecedeNew Land

Recreational facilities have been
available to students at SUNYA for
some time. Camp Dippiklll was pur-
chased by the Faculty-Student Asso-
ciation, with the approval ofthe Stu-
dent Association and opened to the
students and faculty March 3, 1963.

The camp is located fourteen
miles north of Lake George, about
eighty miles from Albany. When it
was first opened, Dippiklll could

accommodate about thirty people.
Facilities Available

Because it is located in the Adir-
ondacks, Dippiklll provides an ex-
cellent area for winter sports. The
camp is also an exeellent “stopping
off point" for ski trips. For spring
and autumn recreation, Dippiklll has»
its own lake.

The title to the land is held by
the Faculty-Student Association,

THE OLD FARM house at Camp Dippiklll is situated in deep

woodland many miles from the nearest neighbor. The house is

situated in rough, uncultivated
the recently purchased Mohawk
ing meadows and thin woodland.

country, quite the opposite of
land. The new property is roll-

though the cost of the camp has
been replaced by the Student Asso-
ciation. Since the Student Associa-
tion has not been legally incor-
porated, the deed remains in the
hands of Strident-Faculty Associa-
lion.

At the close of the 1964-65 school
year, $62,055.40 was available in
the Student Association funds for
the development of Dippiklll. Within.
the next two years, major con-
struction should begin at the site.
Money will be allotted periodically
for upkeep of the camp.

Mr: Blodgett, Assistant Director
of Student Affairs, expressed hopes
that a committee. representing stu-
dents.and faculty will be formed to
consider the problems of the de-
velopment of Dippiklll, along with
the Mohawk site.

Further information about the
rules concerning the use of facilities
at Camp Dippiklll are available in
the Student Activities Office in A1-
den.

Comp Johnston
Another camp owned by the Fac-

ulty-Student Association was Camp

Ipen a girls' camp, and the one
building on the property was erected
in the 1030’s. Some mention of the
land's use for freshman orientation

Drive West on Washington
Ave. until the entrance to the
Northway. Head north on the
Northway for about fifteen
miles until the Town of Cres-
cent exit. Lcoving this exit
turn left onto Crescent Rood.
Go two blocks until Boyock
Road and turn left. Drive until
the end of Boyock Road and
turn right on River Rood. Di-
rectly across the road ls Mo-
hawk River Property.

 

 

 

Johnston was left to the Associa-
tion in a will, and the taxes had

been paid by the StudentAssrwlation.
Over the past summer it was sold

for $1,500, and after the taxes had
been paid, the balance was returned

to the Student Association fund.
Overall Plan
Consequently, the only site avail-

able to the University for trips of
a weekend nature is, at the present

time, Dippiklll. It is hoped that life
site will one day be developed to

accommodate larger groups seeking
recreational facilities in the Adir-

dacks.

Perhaps the site could be rented
to other groups for outings or con-
ferences, and in this way earn part
of the money needed for its upkebp.
At this time, Dippiklll is apart of
the University's plan for develop-
ment of the greatest possible rec-
rcational facilities.

MR. BLODGETT DESCRIBES the extent of the Mohawk
to an interested student.

Mohawk RiverProperty to Serve
As University Recreational Area

Many students traveling north.on Route 87, the Northwey. may have noticed a
large conspicuous Thruway Motor inn, Quality Courts sign on the left side of the
road about .2 of a mile after the Crescent Bridge. This billboard is constructed on
a piece of the seventy acres of land which the Faculty—Student Association, inc.
purchased last semester. Saturday morning Hollis Blodgett, assistant director of
student affairs, accompanied by this reporter and an ASP photograph left Brubacher

Hall to visit this future
recreational area. He got
on the Northway heading
toward Saratoga. After a
short ride of approximately

fifteen minutes, he turned off at
the Town of Crescent exit onto
Crescent Road. Turning right he
proceeded along Crescent Road to
the first crossroad in the Town of
Crescent and turned right again.

Continuing until the end of this
road he turned right onto River
Road, crossed over the Northway
and arrived at 1831 River Road,
the exact address of the new sight.

Our land borders on the North-
way for about a half of a mile. A
few acres are situated on the right
side of River Road, but the major
expanse of land is on the left.

The vibrating sounds of carpen-
ters at work were heard as the
entered the driveway. The workmen
under the supervision of Russell
Bedford, superintendent ofbuildlngs
and grounds, were busy replacing
sections of the farmhouse roof.

Once the work on the roof is
finished, interior work can begin.
According to Mr. Blodgett, the farm-
house will include a student lounge
and snack bar. The room proposed
as the student lounge has one brick
wall with a set-in fire place —
perfect for cold winter nights.

On the other side of the house is
the proposed sight of the snack bar.
The Faculty-Student Organization,
Food Service, will probably be in
charge of this. Behind the kitchen
is a large storage room which has
to he completely uverhaulcribecauso
most of the flooring and parts ofthe
walls are Worn and rotten.

Also leading off of the kitchen
is an outside patio bordered by a
petunia flower garden. Standiugout-
side on the patio and avoiding the
workmen, he was ablotolook across
the field towards the born, the
Thruway Motor inn billboard, and
the inlet of the Mohawk River.

This large field, formerly a hay
meadow, sloped down To the lake
or "lagoon" as Mr. lilodgeti named
ii. Stale students working at the
area this summer have cleared
away lhe hay and kept the field
looking like a lawn.

The banks along the water were
also cleared and several stone fire-
places were consti'urried. Many other
fireplaces were built in other loca-
tions within the seventy acres for
future use as picnic groves.

While Mr. Blodgett walked along
the shore he saw several kinds of

wildlife. A small flock of ducks
took off in flight after he acci-
dently discovered and roused them
from their resting place. Birds,
fish, and muskrats seemed in abun-
dance, too.

The 0th animal he actually came
in contact with was one frog who
luckiessly hopped in front of his
path. This reporter tried unsuc-
cessfully to catch it, so Mr. Blod-
geli did the honors. Carrying it
about for several minutes, Mr.
Blodgett finally decided to return it
to its natural habitat.

Before returning to the car to
drive to the other side of the pro—
perty, he stopped to admire the large
red barn and beautiful apple orchard
next to the house. Next, Mr. Blodgett
drove around to the entrance of the
inlet.

The old Barge Canal which passed
along this route makes an excellent
trail on this part of the land. Pos-
sible picnic areas were cleared out
along here this summer. Mr. Blod-
gett explained that in the seventy
aues there would be several picnic
sites joined by a trail.

The lake bordering the new land
is being cleared of watercress.
The State has been working on a
five year program to eradicate
watercress from the Mohawk River.
When the lake is clear, swimming,
boating and fishing could be pos-
sible. Also, once travel to the small
island. is possible, recreational fa-
cilities could he established there.

Other suggestions tossed around
for recreational use of the available
land were a golf range, beginners
ski slope, hiking or riding trails,
and a soft ball area. The opportun-
ity for extensive recreational fa-
cilities is equally balanced by the
possiblities for academic pro-
grams.

Tile proximity of the area offers
a large outdoor laboratory or field
trip area for many of the sciences.
While this acreage has unlimited
possibilities there still remains
much work to be completed.

Unfortunately, groups will not be
able to use the area until adequate
am proper sanitation facilitieshav
been installed. a
