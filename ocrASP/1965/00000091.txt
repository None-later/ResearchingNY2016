tion of the contemporary and the

ture, independent, individualised
person should emerge. .

But you may ask, and rightly,
what do we mean by ' a mature
person? What are the elements that
join together to form such a man
or woman? if we are willing even
for the moment to agree that the
development of mature people is a
function of the university, can we
agree on what makes them mature?
is it the subject matter they study
or the people they know or the or-
ganizations they join? is it the
sophistication of their social con-
tacts or the worldliness of their
a: perience? Does it demand physi-
cal stamina or spiritual tendencies,
together or separately? Does it ask
for callousness or sensitivity, for
gaiety or seriousness? Does it de-
mand that youthfulness be cast
aside? is it an attribute of social
consciousness or a religious frame
of mind or a power to face up to
material necessities? Is it all or
some or none of these?

These are all legitimate ques-
tions. I can best try to answer them
by sketchingvout what i believe tobe
the elements of maturity in our
society, elements that represent
what is left or what should be left
within your heart and mind alter
having been a member of this aca-
demic community for four years.
And let me say parenthetically that
these same elements relate not only
to the student but to the institution
itself.

1. The first of these elements is
an awareness of responsibility.

Many of you come to us at a point
in your experience when your every
step has been guarded lest you
stumble, and eager hands have sup-
ported you lest you should fall and
be bruised. Every rough spot has
been made easy, every falling has
been excused on the basis of your
youth, every crisis has been met
with the help oi someone, whether
parent, teacher, or other. But by
the time you leave here, all this
will have been changed. Responsi-
bilities that arise from day to day
or week to week will be yours to
shoulder alone or with your peers.
The world will not condone your
errors oi omission and commission
indefinitely without (arcing you to
pay a penalty. And if you insist
upon shirking your responsibilities,
you in turn will be forcing a penalty
upon the world, for you will be
shaping it in your own indecisive
image. After all, individually and
collectively you are tomorrow's
world. it is not too—eTErly for you to
begin to remember this fact regu-
lariy.

Thus the University should and,
I hope, will move steadily toward
making you independent and respon-
sible. It will urge you to look upon
your education as a broad pattern
and to take a major role in weaving
that pattern. It will expect you, as
the weeks and months pass, to make
decisions and to take the conse-
quences for them when they are
wrong. it will reply to many oi your
questions with still more questions
rather than with easy answers.This
is not to say that the University will
ignore you, but rather that it will
look to you to decide for yourselfon
the system oi study and living that
can afford you the fullest measure
of development. it will listen willing-
ly but not indefinitely and not al-

ways responsiver to your requests
that someone also tell you what to
do, for you are now moving toward
the age when you should and can
contributewmorev and more, to the

 

febut'

munity you share together. Life in ‘

combination oi preoccupation: with ’

your own opportunities and prob--
lime, and with those oi the com-
munity oi which you are a' part.

al‘ And if you wish, you can learn this

lesson during your university years.

All around you are the activities .

[that weld you into an identifiable
entity and give you your own charac-
ter as a campus. You can adopt
attitudes oi apathy and aloofness
toward these, should you so desire.
if you do, through force of habit
you will probably carry along with
you later the same attitudes to apply
to your citizenship responsibilities
in the community. Or, out of a
sense of belonging, you can give
part of yourself and your energies
to the task oi making campus life
more meaninng for everyone.
Whatever talents you have that lend
themselves to the general better-
ment are a gift to you and are meant
to be shared, not to be handled
to your citizenship responsibilities
in the community. 0r, out oi a
sense oi belonging, you can give
part of yourself and your energies
to the task of-making campus life
more meaningful for everyone.
Whatever talents you have that lend
themselves to the general better-
ment are a gift to you and are meant
to be shared, not to be handled
seifishiy. The time to learn the les-
son of generous participation and
constructive support is now.

in the awareness of responsi-
bility, therefore, we find a major
step forward to maturity. The
breadth with which we are able to
develop and measure our respon-
sibilities is a key to our later
effectiveness in strengthening a
democratic society.

2. The next element is an unend-
ing curiosity leading to serious
scholarship.

it is a well-worn adage, but a
valid one, that a university is ded-
icated to the search-for truth. 1 his
seems a simple and, in many ways,
obvious kind of statement with which
everyone can piously agree. But i
should warn you that in the straight-
forwardness of this belief lies a
power greater than all our man-
made nuclear weapons. The stub-
born insistence of the scholar that
he must take his stand on the search
for truth wherever it may lead him
is the underlying cause for all the
suspicion, mistrust, and calumny to
which he finds himself frequently
subjected. His quandary on the one
hand is that the world of reality
adjusts itself to the art of compro-
mise; that it can sometimes set
aside principle for expediency and
not reap the consequences for along
time; that it need not, if it chooses,
go to, extremes. 0n the other hand,
however, the scholar knows that the
truth never lies between right and
wrong and that halfway stations are
a delusion. He knows that he can all
too frequently make no predictions
as to where his search will lead
him or what the results will be. He
knows that he must admit to dis-
covering the unpalatable and the
meretriclous as well as the noble
and forthright. He knows the danger
of curiosity, and he knows also, as
Professor Edmund Morgan of Yale
says, that a university "is aplaco
where the world's hostility to cur-
iosity can be defied." And Profes-
sor Morgan goes on with what will
seem to some an outrageous state-
ment but which those of us who are
dedicated to academic life know is
the only possible point of View. He
says:

"The search for (truth) has
again and again overturned
institutions and beliefs of long
standing, in science, in re-
ligion, and in politics. it is
easy enough to see today
that these past revolutions
brought great benefits to
mankind. it was less easy to
see the benefits while the
revolutions were taking
place, especially if you hap-
pened to be quite satisfied
with the way things were be-
fore. Similarly it is not al-
ways easy today to see that
the satisfaction of ascholar’s
curiosity is worth the dis-
ruption of society that may
result from it.”

During these undergraduate years
and perhaps the graduate years to
.isz!!9w...vw extent rivewnrwnu

and the willingness on your part
to pursue the truth without equivo-
cation will determine whether or
not you belong in the ranks of
scholars. And even if you should
fall short and step aside, your uni-

versity experience should give you

the kind of mature judgment that
makes you realize as a citizen

how essential is this freedom of’

curiosity and freedom of search
on the part of your fellow citizens
who have chosen to be scholars.

3. Another vital element of ma-
turity is an awareness of the values
of privacy.

i come now to what may seem to
some an unimportant factor, but is
in reality one of the most difficult
attributes of maturity to capture.
This is because of the nature, the
demands, and the temptations of
our modern world.. it is a reveal-
ing circumstance that as we have
created more leisure-for ourselves
through modern inventions and so-
clnl changes, we also have de-
veloped other inventions and brought
about other changes that tend to de-
stroy our privacy or at least make
it seem unnecessary or undesirable
to us. Moreover, in whatever rho-
ments of privacy that remain, we
tend to become addicted to hours of
aimless occupation largely depend-
ent upon outward strmull that effec-
tively keep us from using our minds.

If a major purpose of education is
indeed to put us into the world of
thought, then as educated men and
women we should learn how impor-
tant are our hours of privacy and
how insistent we must be upon such
hours. it is during such solitary
timesthat the mature student comes
into his own. A very real test of the
educated man is what he can find to
do when he is left to his own devices
with no gadgets to help him. lfl
could have my way and could create
the Utopian university (a completely
impossible wish on my part), i
would urge that every student live
alone. This would guarantee that

after all his gregarious urges were

fulfilled, there would be a place to
which he could retire, shut the
door, and be alone with histhoughts,
his books, and his dreams. Out of
his reflective moments might come
creative and imaginative ideas with
some chance of their being pursued
without interruption.

The university cannot even come
close to providing Utopia in this
regard, but it can urge the student
to struggle mightily for whatever
privacy he can achieve. It can help
him by using more of the facilities
it has as places for quiet study.
There are still times and places
to be alone. The student or scholar
need not be antisocial, but he must
guard his meditative opportunities
or his intellectual development will
be arrested.

4. Still another elementofmatur-
ity is a pervading sense ofhumility.

The danger of our arrogance
grows ever greater in a world
where the pace of scientific and
technological discovery has accel-
erated by geometric proporations.
We probe into space, we search
the bottom of the sea, we change
men’s attitudes with drugs, we pre-
dict and accomplish breakthroughs
in area after area of knowledge
hitherto deemed fantastic. And in
the exhilarating flush of discovery
we can, if we are not careful, lose
our perspective and our sense of
Values.

There is a point, however, at
which we reach maturity as scl-
entists or researchers or scholars.
And that point can and should be
reached during one's university ex«
perience. Kierkegaard identified
this *so well when he said that ma-
turity consists in the discovery that
“there comes a critical moment
where everything is reversed, after
which the point becomes to under-
stand more and more that there is
something which cannot be under-

stood": Such an “awareness can only

make one humble and should lead
to a more comprehensive .vision
of the universe and the role we
play in it. in spite of all we have
learned and discovered, man's prob.
lems in his relationship to man re-
man :the same. This is a sobering
and deflating thought.

5. A fifth element of maturity is
a passion for participation in the
significant events of life.

The truly educated person sees
his relevance to the world in which
he lives. He understands that he
shares with others the responsibility
for its mistakes and its difficulties.
As his knowledge and wisdom grow,
so also should there grow within
him an increasing urge to be of
help. The mature individual cannot
stand by passively while the im-
portant and significant problems of
his community, his country, and his
world remain unsolved. He knows
that even though he himself may
not have contributed personally to
the creating of the difficulties, it
still devolves upon him to share in
their solution. Otherwise he even-
tually becomes no more than a
selfish clod.

The world may indeed be suffer-
ing from many ills, but this is an
exciting, even thrilling time in its
existence and therefore in ours.
We are about to make great political
decisions in our own country. Tre-
mendous struggles having social,
economic, and ideological overtones
are taking place in our hemisphere
and on other greatcontinents.Every
day seems to bring forth its own
new crisis. And every crisis will
be solved only by the active, dedi-
cated, even passionate assistance
of mature men and women of good
will everywhere.

Your educational experience with-
in the University should somehow
give you not only the realization
that these great movements are
taking place, but also the eagerness
to be involved actively with the
world's dramas, even though your
individual role is only a bit part.
One cannot stand aside from the
major currents of world change and
still be fully alive. One cannot even
ignore the lesser and undramatic
episodes that mark the complica-
tions and progress in the develop-
ment of the local community without
admitting that he is shirking his
democratic responsibilities and
squandering his democratic rights.

It is by no means too early for
you to be concerned over the social
and civic problems of your own
communities. It is not too early for
you to select those areas of par-
ticular interest to you and to begin
to determine how you will ultimately
participate. The eagerness and the
sense of belonging you develop now
can and will be a major factor in
how large will be the satisfactions
of life you find eventually. Sueh
satisfactions will grow in propor-
tion to how much you work for
others. Maturity encourages self-
lessness.

6. The final element of maturity
is that of a recognition of individ-
ual worth.

I suppose that in some ways your
awareness of and belief in the dig-
nity of the individual are the core
of your education and therefore the
true measure of your maturity as
a believer in democracy. Certainly
the Place and importance of the in-
dividual form the battleground where
we find ourselves in complete con-
flict with communist ideology. And
yet unless this becomes so much a
part of our education that it is
zzslntuallylpalrt !of our very selves,

easy a or
“more. us to forget or

The history of Western man re-
veals a steady succession of steps
by which the struggle for the inde-
pendence of the individual and for
the recognition of his warm has
gradually been won. There have
been occasional reverses in this
struggle, but the total movement

 

 

effort centers aromd the N gro ﬁnd

his bid for equality not only under '

the law but through acceptance in
the hearts of men. ~ ' _
To achieve a mature attitude to-.
ward these movements, one must
place them in the framework of
history, one must be cognizant of
causes and effects, and aboveall,
one must become inbued with the
compassion that makes us weep
inwardly when others starve or are
ill-treated. if our OWn souls are
precious to us, so too are the souls
of our brothers everywhere in the
world. if we yearn for our own
recognition and cherish our own
dignity, we can do no less for
those less fortunate than ourselves.
Education helps us towards this
attitude and makes us simultan-
eously world-conscious and indi-
vidual-conscious.

The philosophy the university
adopts in its relationship with in-
dividual students has great effect
upon whether or not they wtll ac-
cept and champion such an attitude.
When the university feels keenly
the need to consider the student as
an individual no matter how many
times he is multiplied, then the
latter feels that same concern for
those around him and elsewhere.
When the university uses rules and
regulations inflexibly and without
regard for the human equation, then
the student even with his occasional
rebellions against such edicts will
learn the selfsame habits of inflex-
ibility. lie will tend tothink in terms
of groups or conglomerations or
associations that can be classified
and categorized rather than of per-
sons, each with his individual pre-
rogatives and responsibilities, and,
most of all, each with a. dignity of
self that calls for preservation and
nurture. This is unimportant lesson
for the maturing student and the
maturing university to learn to-
gather.

The task of the university, there-
fore, is to bring about not merely
the whole man but what Woodrow
Wilson called the "wholly awakened
man.” It is to bring to you as stu-
dents a sense of the action and the
passion of the time and to give you
the maturity to turn such action and
passion toward positive and con-
structive ends. And the first part
of this task is to have you aware that
as of this moment you stand in
danger of being caught up in the
world of thought, the world where
we, think you ultimately belong, else
the University would not have chosen
to have you here. If you truly look
upon this as a danger or even as an
obstruction to your other reasons
for coming, then you should with-
draw and avoid what is bound to be
an unhappy experience. But if you
have even some slightrestless stir-
ring within you, some still uniden-
tifiable urge to learn, to think, to
act, and so to be helpful in this
world to the utmost ofyour capacity,
then there is no limit to your pc-
tentiality as a scholar and as a
humane being.

in the process of making avail-
able to you the elements of matur-
ity for yourselves, the intellectual
maturity of the 'campus has been
developing simultaneously. For, as
l have already hinted several times,
many of the same elements lhave
just described apply to the univer-
sity as well as to the individual.
The mature university has an aware-
ness of responsibility; it has a zeal
to discover, to be curious, to search
for the truth; it has a commitment
to freedom that transcends any ex-
pediency or compromise; it must
be able to explain itself articulaton
and it must pass on to the world
whatever it learns or discovers; it
is a part of life, not aloof from it;
it has deep concern for the dignity
and worth of the individual whether
0" "10 caml’us or anywhere in the
world. And just as the University
measures you in your development
you as students have the right it
measure the University as to the
degree of maturity it makes evident
by Its atmosphere and its actions.

In the motion picture world of to-
day, a' world of bedroom farce and
gmgpithrills, of James Bond, the
Beatles, and Doris Day, it is a rare

occasion indeed, when a film such'

as Ely Lendau's “The Pawnbroker"
graces the motion picture screen,
as' testament to the fact that to a
small, brave band of film makers,
the movie is not only an art form,
but ialso.an important media for
serious commentary on our time.

“The Pawnbroker” is a magni-
ficent example of this rare breed
of film — one that is meant not to
tickle the senses, but to numbthem;
not just to touch the nerves, but to
fray them. its plot is at once so
simple, and yet so very deep —
the story of a man who survives
one hell only to be caught in another
of his own making. '

Asphalt Jungle

The story concerns a Jewish
pawnbroker, survivor of a German
concentration camp, who makes his
place of business in a little cage
of a pawnshop in New York’s Spanish
Harlem, in the heart of the asphalt
jungle. The pawnbroker, played bril-
liantly by Rod Steiger, has suc-
ceeded, so he thinks, in casting all
feeling and emotion from his life.
Making money in his little pawnshop
is all he lives for. and. as he says

But though the man has erased
emotion from his life, he cannot
erase the memory of what befall
him twenty-five years before —
when he saw his young son suffo-
cate in a Nazi death train; when
he saw his sister’s husband caught
and filed by German hounds as he
tried to scale the barbed wire of
the concentration camp fence; and
when a German soldier thrust his
head through a window so he could
watch an officer strip off his wife's
clothing.

Now, on the twenty-fifth anni-
versary of that ordeal, the mem-
ories come back to haunt him, re-
fusing to let him isolate himself
from reality. 0n the surface,though,
he still puts up a good front to
those who know or meet him. To

‘University of Utopia’
Falls Short of Realism

(Editor's note: This is a review of
“The University of Utopia" by Rob-
ert Hutchings, The University of
Chicago Press (P,B.) $1.50)

by William Gross

Utopian writing has long been an
effective means of pointing out the
deficiences of the established order.
The genre forces the author to
place his university in the context
of an ideal society.

There can be no Utopian univer-
sity; there must be a Utopia which
has a university. Speculation cen-
ters on, if there were a Utopia,
what would its university he like?

Many of the university functions
would be dropped. Doctors of driver
education would not be needed in
California’s colleges. Florida State
would no longer teach circus per-
formers. Oklahoma would not need
to continue its college level courses

in beauty culture. While these are
necessary skills, is a university
the proper place to teach them?

Research Centers

Hutchins also condemns using uni-
versities as research centers. Com-
mon belief is that if a professor is
working in research, he will be
much closer to what is happening in

his field, and be, therefore, abette
teacher. Hutchins believes the re
verse is true.

If he spends all his time on
teaching and preparing lessons, how
can he be his best on his research?
If he does not, how can he be ade-
quately prepared to face a class?

other forms of specializedloarn-
ing are also attacked. Can journa-
lism, for example, be learned any
place but on a newspaper? Then

shouldn’t the university restrl

itself to the academic aspects of
journalism, assuming there is one,

rather than the practical?

in addition to some reasonably

sound logic, Professor llutchi
uses satire to make his point.

tlonE? it becomes an institution for

is n scientific and

the propagation and perpetuation of
the liberal arts.

Professor Hutchins does attempt
to establish the value of such a
university. instead of reiterating
the tired cliches (learning to think,
or teaching the whole man) which
were unable to meet the challenge
of "practical" vocational educa-
tion, and permitted the technological
society to become the new ortho-
doxy; Professor Hutchins tries to
laugh us into reform.

“l have no difficulty in imagining
a candidate appealing for votes on
the grounds that he is rougher and
tougher than his opponent and that
he does not have any big thoughts
or know any long words."

"New methods of wasting time
and new objects to waste it on are
being invented every day.The work-
er who previously had only a little
time to get drunk, beat his wife,
or go to a burlesque show, now has
much more time to get drunk, beat
his wife or watch television. No
wonder the liberal feels betrayed."

Hutchins book falls short of
being a true call to arms. Possibly
because it is not frighteningenough.
The university and the public which
supports it must be shocked out of
its complacency. Like so many other
rational men, Hutchins willcontinue
to be ignored.

Bond Novel
Lacks Zip

by ' Larry Epstein

A poor James Bond novel is about 

as subtle as the Jolly Green Giant
would be in Lilliput. “The Man With
the Golden Gun,” [an Fleming’siast
saga of the adventures of 007 is,
unfortunately, not a very good way
to remember Bond.

The action is picked up from the
preceding novel, "You Only Live
Twice” wherein Bond was left
amidst flame and destruction after
finally killing Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
in TMWTGG we learn that Bond was
presumed dead (his obituary ap-
peared in the Times and he was
considered a national hero) but is,
in reality, still indestructible.

Russian Ally

lie was picked upby some Russian
agents who transformed him into an
ally and packed him off to England
to eradicate M. His attempts fail
and, in order to regain his status,
is assigned to assassinate Scara-
manga, a gunman who has worked
for Fidel Castro. The deed is ac-
complished by the end of the book
but not before Fleming has put Bond
through the usual amount of close
aulls.

One of the major faults of the
book is that there is no island
(the setting is Jamaica) beauty to
soothe Bond over the rough spots
of his adventure. Mary Goodnight,
his old secretary. is the female
protagonist in the book but she is
not a James Bond girl, 1.43., She
is not an abnormal human being
who gets back in step with humanity
after encountering Bond.lnstend she
is an efficient secretary, a good
conversationalist, nwillinglistensr,
but not a suitable companion for the
likes of our hero.

Below the Murder
Francisco Scaramanga, the man
with the golden gun, is a good crea-
tion that doesn't come off, Scar-
amnnga, parenthetically, requires
wild sexual activity before com-
mitting murder. ,
There are hints of good writing
sprinkled through the novel, but
