possible lineups they can compete with tomorrow.

On Monday, September 27, the AMIA football season
is slated to begin. With cautious optimism and re-
served high hopes. we look forward to seeing the
league swing into what we believe can be its finest
season in a number of years. -

Eight teams are entered in the “big league” —
with the five Albany fraternities each entering a
team. There are two dormitory teams and one inde-
pendent squad. Early reports indicate that each team
has had a large turnout, and the enthusiasm felt in
conversations about the upcoming seasonis unparalled
in recent years.

Eight teams, all five fraternities. large turnouts.
unmatched enthusiasm-~almost too good to be truel
Seriously. the pre-season indications all point toward
a highly successful and very rewarding season for the
AMIA football league, and no organization deserves it
more. It is our sincere hope that the officers selected
in the AMIA election next Wednesday will take full
advantage of the participants’ exuberance, willingness,
and cooperation to effect an efficiently run and well
coordinated season. One such successful season could
lead to a successful year, which indeed would be an
asset to State’s athletic department.

Well, if you get a chance, stop by Vets Field on
Saturday and Monday; it'll be sort of like readinga

This year's squad, missing eight

successfully last year, is not quite
in as good shape as coach Keith
Munsey would like it to be, Co-captain (along with Flick) Ken
Kirik will be attempting a come-

man tomorrow.

The number one runner for the

Joe Keating. Keating from Glens

Impress Robinson

Robinson, State's all-time cross-

the time potential of his runners
from the trial run, as the lead five

the course considerably. Neverthe-
less, he is confident that the Dane

game.

The State hooters are
still suffering from lack of
veterans as coach Garcia
is frantically trying to es-
tablish a starting lineup.

in scrimmages with Williams and
Union during the past week, Garcia
constantly was substituting into the
lineup, giving all of the players a
chance to gain a position.

The team looked quite disjointed
at times during the scrimmages,
often due to lack of an organized
front. This could possibly be at-
tributed to the short time with
which the members have been play-
ing together. Only five lettermen
are back to lead this year’s cam-
paign.

Montclair is a perenially power-
ful cross-country school. in last
year's meet, won my Montclair, the
New Jerseyites placed runners in
the two through five positions, all
trailing State’s Joe Keating to the
wire.

Last year's soccer team posted
a 4-5-1 record, and this year’s
team will undoubtedly have a tough
time in matching it.

The fresh have several top-notch
high school performers. The top
two runners, Mike Atwell of Her-
klmer and Don Beevers of Cobles-
kill, placed high in the top 10 of
a state-wide cross-country run held
in Cobleskill last year.

Bill Mathews of Colonie is the
city mile champ with a 4:35 clock-
ing. Paul Breslin of Binghamtonhas
recorded a 4:33 mile and a 2:01
half mile.

Dave Leaf of Hudson Falls is the
half mile champion of his high
school conference. Carl Shepard and
Carl Spring are also possibilities
for the traveling squad.

Robinson added, “They could
catch on. They have a good attitude
and i wouldn't be surprised if they
could go up. it’s definitely a good
team."

as featured guest.

The students will serve
with faculty and adminis-
tration on committees
dealing with academic
standing, admissions pol-
icy. curriculum, and hon-
ors and independent study.

Thorne pointed out that this move
is part of a long range move which
has included students in more phases
of the University administration. lie
added that students will not partici-
pate in questions involving charges
against individuals or'ccnfidential
records.

University's Role

in answering a question on the
role of the University in taking care
of the student, he said that his office
is responsible for the“totnl welfare
of the student body."

The next question, asked by Mr.
John Reilly, English Faculty,
brought the response that Albany
encourngcs students to think for
themselves and to handle their own
affairs.

Theme for Your

Art Council's theme for this year
is "Revolutions in the Twentieth
Century." All the art shows to be
presented by the council and each
of the four speakers who have been
invited to deiivor lectures this year
will deal with some aspect of this
theme.

Allen Knprow, known best for his
controversial art Happenings, which
have been produced off-Broadway in
the Dust few years, will discuss the
psychology behind and the problems
encountered in directing a produc-
tion of happenings in art.

Kaprow is currently occupied in
writing a hook on his experiences
in the theatre with particular ref-
erence in his Happenings.

Pop Artist 5. Crime

A pop artist, William Accorsi,
will present a program of animated
sculpture in the form of a play. “is
“Steam George and the Dragon"
will be presented in March.

The apparent contradiction was
clenrcd by Thurne’s sluielnuni that
the University assumes the position
of the pnrcnt onlv in those sltlliilluns
when there is genuine necessity.

Bus Strike

He said that his office had pnr-
tit'iputed in the strike tnlks between
the bus drivers and United ’I‘rnction.
As of Sunday night, the union and
management had agreed to continue
service to the students during the
strike.

The Vice President asked for stu-
dents to understand that the checks
from state and federal loans are
delayed only by necessary paper
work. its added that most student

General Comments

He expressed doubt that the con-
ditions of housing and busing have
had any effect on students choosing
this college.

Thorne stated that his position
as Vice President is very different
from his former position as Dean
of Students. He summed up the dif-
ference by stating that a dean acts
"to" the President while u vice
president acts "for" the President.
