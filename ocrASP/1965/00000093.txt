, ,mpso said that hethpedithe Coun-
_ oi  have a produgtive year for-the '
“ ' school. 'His 's‘emiipessimistic attitude
"is well-founded as the history of student
government at the University reveals.
In ~past years, Student AssociatIOn
» Presidents have faced the task of keep-
am}; the enthusiasm'of governmentrep-
resentatives alive. Last year, the situ-
: ationbecame ridiculous as ArtJohnstbn.

‘ former SA President, found it increasf

ingly difficult to muster a quorum in

Senate! _ ‘ . . .
The problems faced by Johnston pro-
vided much-of the impetus behind, the
formation of ‘a new form of student
government.

We feel that this year will be different.
Our optimism is based on several fac-
tors.

One of these is the new government
itself. Under the new government struc-
ture. much of the unimportant work will
be handledby the commission and boards.

Thompson takes‘hi‘s job in the new
government seriously. He knows the
government’s strengths and weaknesses,
and the people in the government.

He is able to lead the, Council and is
ready to take the initiative when it be-
comes necessary. More important he
knows that student government cannot
be run successfully as a “one man
show,” one of the grievances cited
agains the government in the past.

This is evidenced in an interview with
the ASP when he said he hoped that he
could “delegate enough authority and
responsibility so that members of the
government do not become bored with
their area of study like. what happened
with Senate.” ,

With his leadership‘and-theexperience..
and enthusiasm of manyof the people
in the government, we feel that the stu-
dent body will finally have a productive
student government.

it is indeed gratifying that most of the
Greeks have taken steps to pay their
bills to the Torch. Sigma Alpha and
Kappa Beta had paid theirs. although
the Torch was not aware of Sig Alph’s
payment.

We are offended by the attitude of at
least one Greek in inferring that we are
willing to criticize the short coming of
the Greeks. If we had a policy of ignor-
ing praise-worthy Greek doings, this
attitude would have some justification.

Another Greek. in her zeal to defend
her group, revelas a slightly confused
interpretation of responsibility.

Somehow she is able to assert that
her group is showing wonderful respn-

The political system in Albany is coni-
posed basically of a strong 44 year old
machine and an ineffectual young reform
movement.

'This is true to such- an extent that the ‘
feeble efforts of the reformers or Harder
Democrats or CURE Democrats have had
no effect except to place the machine

more on its toes.
We do not mean to say either that re-

form is good and Godly or that reform
is evil and Godless. We do say that the
reformers have slated people with little
or no appeal and with less success. The
only exception would be Daniel Ganeles

of our facul .
do ngi deny any of the charges

against the machine. We say only that
if there is corruption it should be the
task of the reformers to obtain proof

and a conviction. We are tired of talk.
We reject the thought that the machine

can cover its errors through its control
of the local judiciary. Many of the charges
made by the reformers fall under the
jurisdiction of the state and not the city
or the county. Still we have heard only
talk and seen no legal action.

For years it has been fashionable to
criticize the music of young people. To-
‘day there seems to 'be a new mood.
Anyone listening to WPTR, WTRY or
our own WSUA lmows that several new
hits deal with our society and where its
headed. "Everyone’s Gone to the Moon”
is a brand new good example. The singer
asks us to evaluate our true goals. He
obviously prefers the problems on earth
to our space effort.

Donovan’s “ The Universal Soldier" is
another example. The young Scotsman
describes the armies of all ages. They
are composed by the bodies of the
world’s men from age 17 to 36, accord-
ing to him. He states that the orders
to fight now come from us. He states
that “this is not the way to put the end
to war.”

We like the idea that high school and
college people are buying music with
some thought in it. We do not necessarily
agree with any of the reasoning ina song
such as Donovan’s, but it is refreshing
to hear a song with meaning.

It's extremely Freudionl »

linen letter to Foreign Students

Speaking to you is your fellow foreign student who has had the chance
of continuous stay on this campus for over three years. Experience has
been my best teacher, so, a little tip from me might be valuable.

Please, get into your books immediately; and if you happen to be
taking a course or two which require term papers, start working on
your papers early enough, for writing term papers is our greatest
weakness. It is ironical, but true, to say that petty tests called quizzes
count heavily in the making of your final grade. So, please, take every
one of these quizzes seriously. Maybe it will suffice to add that a dis-
agreement or an argument with a lady professor may earn you an un-
desired grade. I only wish I was capable of advising myself In ’62.

Out of class you may also avoid such provocative political questions
as "What do you think of America's presence in Vietnam? What is
Kwame Nkruma doing with his political opponents? Isn't he a nut?"
Maybe my examples are extreme, but any question of that category is

I not impossible.

More interesting, however, are those social and friendly questions
which I am afraid are directed particularly to African students. During
my freshman days, such questions varied from “How many elephants
does your father own?” to “Are you a member of the ‘head hunter'
tribe?” I had my ways of answering those questions which made my
inquisitive friends chuckle; but you might be unlucky to encounter a
question about "Tarzan" which, of course, you don't know until you see
a couple of T.V. movies in this country.

Don't, however, misunderstand those who ask suoh questions for
they are earnestly interested to learn about Africa, but they cannot
keep space with the wind of change in the "Black Continent," and,
by the way, who can?" Your friend might understand that their ques-

. tions are antique if you play them a little game. Ask themgto take you

downtown to the Hudson Hitler to see for yourself the Indian tribesmen
barter beaver skins for Elizabethan gin!

In spite of everything I have attempted to say, this campus can be
very interesting if you only try to tolerate and understand these people.
It is a big campus now, but don't be surprised if a half of Waterbury

and Brubacher

Halls come to learn of your first date. Here news

spreads like a bush fire, but dies at the same rate. So friends, never
get discouraged, join in the fun and receive informal education as well.
The campus and perhaps the Capital City have a lot to offer you.
“Karibu.” Welcome and good luck. Let us meet at the next meeting
of International Student’s Association.

COMMUNICA TIONS

Thanks Publicly Expressed

To the Editors:

As president of the Art Council,
l’d like to publicly express my ap-
preciation to those individuals who
helped make our booth successful
at Activities Day.

First, I'd like to thank Roger
French who planned, built, and
manned the booth. lie was seconded
by Betsy Mickel, Linda Beaham,
Laurie Miller, and Brenda Miller.

Then, l'd like to thank Mr. Cowley
and Mr. Wilson of the University
Art Department who gave us sup-
port. We appreciate it.

And, ultimately, the credit for so
much thoughtful planning rests with
Debby Friedman and Gail Magaleff.
Both were more than helpful in their
efforts to assure us a successful day.

Editorial Refuted

This letter is in response to your
editorial of September 17, entitled
"Glass Houses." Phi Delta sorority
paid for their yearbook pictures in
the early Fall, 1964, for the 1965
yearbook, with a check made out to
"Torch."

Because of the inexperienced and
Irresponsible people in charge, the
$50 check was neither cashed nor
placed in the "Torch" account. It
remained in someone's (tumor and
was forgotten.

Maybe the "Torch" could atford
to forget about $60, but we don't
let the grave responsibility of our
treasury matters be given to an ir-

responsible person. I'm sure that

Phi Delta is not the only Greek that
this has happened to.

Next time you plan on belngcriti-

cal - look for the real source!

Anti—Greek

To the Editors:

If the editorial “Comments” in
your first edition are any indication
of future offerings, and I assume
they are, we are undoubtedly going
to be blessed with various and sull-
dry Anti-Greek comments. I un-
derstand that you need to find some-
thing to editorialize about, BUT . ..
May I quote you: “To avoid becom-
ing a tic-nothing member, Just sign
up for a fewrn'gahlzations. Be active
in only them and contribute as much
as you can. If you find you have rul-
riiilonnl time to contribute to other
activities than (lo so.”

i ask you now, to remember that
there are some of us who choose to
make Greeks our major nr'iiVlll’.
This decision comes after a great,
(tool of consideration of sociologi-
cnl, psychological, academic, and
financial iypes. Some of us are able
to contribute time :qu oifortio other
university activities. Some of us
Cannot...’l‘hc rest of us just don’t.
liui each one of us contributes to
the activity of theuniversitythrough
our group. Wheathcr .you cure to
admit It_ or not, our organizations
‘urc the strongest support of our,
active University and will continue
to be so unless by some miraculous
wuvo Of,,ii|8 hanri Greeks and every-
Ineniory of them vanish from the:

 Better  '

by "fifty Nuchois

The infant Bridge Club at SUNYA
will kick off with its first teaching
session Tuesday- at 7:15 in Bru-
bacher room 8.

This writer will be doing the
teaching chores for the most part,
but helping me out from time to
time will be Bob Leonard, a grad
student here at State.

Earlier this month, Leonard went
to New York and played in a game
with Miss Judy Elis, a former stu-
'dent here at State, whose father is
a fine bridge player and teacher.

Leonard and Miss Elis did this
writer a great favor by winning the
tournament and getting written up
in Alan Truscoit's column in the
Times. The hand which appears
here is one of the hands that they
played in the tourney.

 

The opening bid gave North, Leon. '

ard, a distinct problem. Leonard's
bid was one that he makes quite
often, but hates to make. South’s
cue bid was highly imaginative and
definitely forcing, hoping North
would bid a major.

North how repeated the cue bid
to get South to choose the suit, and
South compiled by bidding her ire
mendous spade suit. Unfortunately,
North had no fit in spades, and had
to force South to chooseasecondary
suit.

South's final bid placed the hand
in the optimum contract. After win-

 

ning the opening lead, Miss Eiis
lead the heart king which West al-
lowed to hold. She then cashed the
space king before leading a second
round of trump.

West won the queen of hearts
with the ace and continued trump
which South won in her hand. The
ace of spaces was cashed and a
spade ruffed in dummy, establish-
ing the spade suit.

Now the ace of diamonds and a
diamond ruff in the South hand put
South on lead to run spades for the
biance of the tricks. Leonard re-
ported that they had scored over a
71% game to win the tournament
with the help of this hand.

Student Finds Danger
In Birch Society Methods

by Jim Begiey

Last week I paid a visit to an
aunt and uncle of mine in Queens.
I had not seen them in over a year.
When I saw them last week they had
changed - metamorphosed.

The air was charged with tense
anxiety. In the basement playroom,
a large poster bore a picture of
Christ rapping on a window of the
Secretariat Building. The caption
read “NO ROOM FOR CHRIST IN
THE INN; NO ROOM FOR HIM IN
THE U.N.”

Cell
The once friendly rec room had
become a meeting place for a cell
of the local John Birch Society.
They were a simple people who
had never really studied or sar-
Iously participated in politics. Now
they had become involved in a fa-
natlc world akin to that. of Big

Brother’s followers in Orwell’s
“1984.”
They see the enemy in every

corner. They see themselves the
saviors of the American people.

And, perhaps worst of all, they
have worked their religious con-
victions into their political doings.
Dogmatlsts in religion, dogmatists
in politics. God is on their side.

They glared angrily at me for
expressing a "liberal" opinion.
They said I think too much. It’s
dangerous to think too much.

Tactics

They are not averse to book
burning and the use within their
membership of a gesiapo-type
thought police who report to the cell
leaders the “pink taint" of liberal-
ism nmong the members.

The whole thing spells danger:
danger to the intellectual growth of
their children who read only Birch
propaganda and danger to the free
society that tolerates thorn.

They have many good intentions

sage once said, “the road to Hell
is paved with good intentions.” And
hell on earth has been the’ end pro-

trines on others by denying them
their ri ht of conscience.

received a 8.5. degrre in Aeronartlical Engineering
[rum the University 0/ Oklahoma. In February
I962, he set world class Iime-Io-c/imb record: in a
1-38 let trainer.)

Is the YF-lZA the world's fastest manned aircraft?
It certainly is. On May 1 of this year the YF-lZA
(formerly known as the A-i l) reclaimed the world
absolute speed record from the USSR. It was
clocked at 2.062 mph over Edwards Air Force Base.

How big is the YF-IZA?

The exact dimensions of the YF-lZA have not been
released yet. But it’s approximately l00 feet long.
with about a 50-foot wingspan. That's half again
as big as our present interceptou!

Is the Air Force training many men
as pilots these days?
Yes. very deﬁnitely. In spite of all you hear about
unmanned vehicles. the human pilot is still very
much In the picture. As a matter of fact. the Air
Force pilot quota is on the Increase.

What other kinds of lofts does the Air Force offer?
Since It's one of the world's foremost technological
organizations, the Air Force has plenty of openings
for scientists and engineers. There are also many
challenging and varied administrative-managerial
positions.

Mr FMW

Air Force ofﬁcer. The new two-year Air Force
ROTC program makes this method available to
men who have already completed a year or two of
their college education. For college graduates. if
you did not take advantage of ROTC. you can
still get started through Air Force Ofﬁcer Training
School (0T8). a three-month course open to both
men and women.

Can I keep up my studies while
I'm In the Air Force?
The Air Force encourages its men and women to
continue their educations. For instance, you may
qualify to study for a graduate degree during off-
duty hours. with the Air Force paying a substantial
part of the tuition.

What kind of future do I have in the Air Force?

A bright one. As we move further into the Aero-

more important. And you can grow with it!
