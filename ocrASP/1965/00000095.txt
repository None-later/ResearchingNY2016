‘ ‘Dr Wright, who has recently
returned from his third trip to
, lndll vsponsored by' the Fulbright

Founddtion, is a specialist in the

 are! 'of the Muslim political mi-

nority in lndia. However, he indi-
cated his solid grasp of the lndian
situation in general. After mention-
ing that the present Chlnese-lndian
cease-fire was somewhat unstable,
he ‘gave 'his audience a general, but
interesting, appraisal of the history
.of the Sin-Indian dispute.

Although we. are accustomed to
speaking of India as a single po-
litical entity, Professor Wright
pointed out that through most of its
history it has been similar to Eu-
rope; it. actually consistedoi sev-
eral unfederated Indian "states, ana-
logous to the many unallied nations
oi Europe. Therefore, because the
confederated state which we know
as lndia has existed only since 1947,
it has no long history of national-
ism. China, on the other hand, has
been ardently nationalistic since
before the time of Jesus. Under the
various dynasties she would growto
her maximum, then lose some area
when a weak ruler came to power,
but would then regain the territory
with the advent of a new ruler or oi
a new dynasty.

The new nationalism oi lndia,
however, has been fighting the new

fore October 18. The exam will be
given on December 4, l965through-
out the country. Applications may be

ment of State, Washington. Specifi-
cation as to which agency the can-

minister an oral examination to
those individuals successful on the
written exam.

To enable State Department ap-
plicants to demonstrate competence
in their respective fields of inter-

foundation in economics, U. S. and

Freshman Class
Begins Work

On Activiti
es

The Class of 1969 has begun work
on its numerous fall activities with
two class meetings, at which frosh
volunteered for work on such com-
mittees as song writing, skit writ-
ing, newspaper and publicity.

A genuine feeling of enthusiasm
characterized both meetings and all
seemed more than willing to devote
time and talent to class activities.

Probably the most difficult prob-
lem has been that ofconnnunication.
A publicity committee has been
formed whose job it is to post all
freshmen meetings and events.

Freshmen are asked to check
dormitory bulletin boards daily for
such announcements.

The freshmen sklt will be pre-
sented on October l5, Parent's Day
weekend. The producer will be Jane
Mandel and a director has yet to be
chosen.

Auditions and casting will take
place on Sunday afternoon and all'
freslnnen are urged to tryout. Time
and place of the auditions will be
announced at the class meeting.

Original lyrics have been written
to several songs for the class sing.
Furxher progress on the slug will
be nnnouncwl at the next class meet-
inc.

Another activity of the fresh has
been to organize a feature for the
October 1:? issue of the Albany Stu-
dent Press.

The next class meeting will be
held today in Page llall an 1:20 p.m.
