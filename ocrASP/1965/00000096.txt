Golden .y.

The Golden Eye. beginning its new
program tonight, is one of the outstand—
ing activities of this University. While
it is sponsored by the Campus Christian
Council, it is by no means a narrow or
proselytizing program.

The Golden Eye is an answer to the
average student’s need for an intro-
duction to relatively deep, intellectual
curiosity. The program of last year
had excellent scope, variety, and con-
tent.

The past programs included.many
state professors. University President
Evan R. Collins, and clergymen in-
cluding two Jesuits.

The excellence of last year’s programs
set, a high standard for this year. To-
night's program, “The Function of Ex-
istentialism Today," indicates that that
standard will be equalled or surpassed.

State Responsibility

As long as the states fail to meet
their responsibility to their citizens,
the federal government will continue to
have a reason to continue its encroach-
ment on areas of government once re-
served to the states.

The above paraphrase of a statement
by the senior senator from Illinois,
Paul H. Douglas, applies to many of the
actions of federal authorities, the Con-
gress and the President.

we are outraged that the federal gov-

ernment has not revised its criminal
law code to prevent the perversions of
law currently occurring in Alabama.

A man was shot in the back while
getting out of his car in his own drive-

gave rides to civil rights workers.
Three young men were murdered be—

that the coroner examining his body
said he had trouble finding an unbroken
bone.

We are sickened by the wanton slaugh-
ter of Negroes and liberals throughout
most of the South. We cannot help but
see more comparisons than contrasts
in this wave of publicly condoned mur—
ders to Hitler’s more systematic
slaughter of his enemies.

We cannot help but say that the people

Perhaps what is needed is to give
federal judges the ability to remove
from a local court any case involving
a civil rights killing.

We somewhat despair for an Ameri—
can which seems to accept the tra—
vesties currently seen in the trials of
Collie Leroy Wilkins. Jr. and Thomas
L. Coleman.

Clearly Alabama, as well as other
states. is not fulfilling the function re-
quired by its own constitution. It is time
for a government willing to act impar-
tially to take jurisdiction in cases in—
volving murders.

They lived in the Residencio, or

The dormitory is ultra-modern.
This provides a curious mixture of
new and old buildings. The univer-

Increased Draft Call

As Associate Dean of Student Affairs

by William Grant
The Collegiate Press Service

WASHINGTON (CPS) — With the
October and November draft calls
the largest since the Korean War,
the, nation's draft boards are set to

' look at, requests fors‘tudent defer-
ments with a}moi~é‘;iiisde‘rnlng:eye. 

The Selective Service System has
no intention of abandoning defer-
ments for students in college and
universities but, under the lighter
policy, draft boards will be picking
up seine deferred students who are
not attending school full time or
who are not making satisfactory
progress in their classes.

On July 28 President Lyndon John-
son announced that a September call
of 27,000 men would be necessary
in order to meet ilieincreased com-
mitment in Vietnam.

Even of [hill time most state Se-
lective Service men were quoth as
saying they didn’t feel the neu flu—
ures would cause any change in the
draft status of most men iii-cause
“draft pools" were large enough to
take care of tho incrcaseddcnmlids.
in most states, draft officials were
quoted, some off the record, us any-
ing that married men with no other
dependents still need not fear for
the driifi. Under a 1003 order by
President Kennedy, married men
with no children were not to be
drafted as long as single men were
available.

But the Defense Department an-
nounced an October call of 33,000
and recently announced its Novem-
ber call of 36,450 - the two largest
calls since the end of the Korean
War. And in November, for the first
time since Korea, the draft will in-
‘clude men for the Marine Corps,
Some - states: began to backtrack
on their previous statements about
married men and many conccdi-d
that it would be necessary to tnkc
married men “sometime in thc
fail."

On August 20, President Johnson
dropped his weil-rememlwrcd
bombshell and announced he had rc-
voked President Kennedy's order
and that from now on lliﬂl‘l'lcd uicn
without children would be consid—
ered the same as single men as far
as the draft is concerned.

The facts remain that with the
increased draft calls, iocnl boni‘ds
are rapidly running out of .‘illiuli'
men between the ages of if) and 20—
ihe present induction limits -— and
the childless married men are thc
next to go.

As one Selective Service ol‘i'icuii
points out, “There is nothing unto—
mntic about a student hciug dc—
fei'red. Each case is considered irii
its own merits with the studcnt‘e
course of study, its importance to
the national interest, and the stu~
dent’s scholastic iibliity” bcinguscd
as measuring slicks.

150 boys. The school sponsors few
activities for the students.

There is no school paper. no
school yearbook. On the whole,there
is very little show of school spirit
except in Greek activities. The sor-
orities and faternities are the
strong social functions at the uni-
versity. The school theatre provides
cultural entertainment. The ex-
change students last year had the
opportunity to see Spanish dancers
and a Chilean ballet.

The students spent most of their
time at hotels and beaches. The
Puerto Ricans enjoys dancing and
head for the dance floors every
Friday and Saturday nights. The
biggest events of the year, how-
ever, are the National Elections
and the Inter-Collegiate Games.

National Elections
Three days before elections the

The rapid growth of the
University has necessitat-
ed-J the ‘ increase v in admin-
istrative personnel. One of
the new Associate Deans of
Students of the Organiza-
tion of Student Affairs is
Mrs. Lois Gregg.

As Associate Dean, Mrs. Gregg
is in direct line with the Vice
President of Student Affairs, Clif-
it)“ C. Thorne, and in his absence
will take charge of the Student Af-
fairs Office. Many of the responsi-
bilities of the Dean of Women are
now in the hands of Mrs. Gregg.

Mrs. Gregg is responsible for
the housing of students, Financial
Aids Office, and International Stu-
dents Advisement Office. She also
works along with Mr. Cheslu, Asso-
ciate Dean of Students, as “first-
line” adviser to commuters, serves
on several university committees,
and acts as liaison representative
to the American Association ofUni-
versiiy Women.

Education

This is Mrs. Greg'g’s first ex-
perience at a New York University.
She was employed since 1000 as
full-time administrator of liagunitu
Court on Stanford University. Mrs.
Gregg received her B.A. in eco-
nonile at U.C.L.A. and her M.A.
at Pacific School of lioligion at
Berkeley.

She also studied ni‘t nt Fresno
State College. Mrs. Gregg has tril-
voied in the U. 3., Canada; in 1955
she tourcd "Around the World with
a Paint Brush.” She has for many
vuni's (lime many paintings varying

in a show at San JonquinVulloy. “or

work are found in California, Now

Mrs. Gregg has also had an in-

Puerto Ricans get very emotional ‘

over the elections. They drive

around in cars all daylong yelling '

and shoutingthelr campaign slogans.

The three parties in Puerto Rico 4

follow similar ideals as do our
political parties. The largest party,
Popular, is best compared to the
Democratic Party; the Estadistas
is like the Republican party, and
the lndepentiste is the reform party.
Following the election there is street
dancing in every village and city.

The weekend before Easter, The
Inter-collegiate Games were held
at Hiram‘Bithorn Stadium near the
University. These games are called
“Justas.” The three other colleges
on the island participate in this
yearly event.

Dormitory living was rated as
good by the exchange students —
with the exception of food, that is.
The girls hours are much more
liberal for weekends. They have
until 3 a.m. on Friday and Satur-
day. On the other days they have
to be in at 10 pm.

 
 

Bod Food
The major complaint was against
the food served in the cafeteria.

'The Puerto Ricans diet is mostly

beans, rice, and bananas. They have
at least one of these staples at
every meal. The exchange students
were amazed at the many ways rice,
beans and bananas can be served.

Meat is seldom served, however,
when it is, it is pork or chicken.

THE UNIVERSITY OF Eureto Rico combines old Spanish architecture and modern on its unique

campus. Clockwise from upper right, the students spend most of their free time at the many beaches
around the campus; the new dormitories and the entrance (Iow'er left) illustrate the new and old;
the University Center has a Post ottice, barber shop, beauty salon and guest hotel.

Varied and Interesting to Students

much like and very much

Sight unseen, Mrs. Gregg moved
all tier furniture to this house.

Fortunately, everything fit in per-
fectly with the decor. Not only do

her furnishings add an authentic
touch to the house but several orig-
inal fixtures remain.

in the entrance way is a corner
china closet made out of the wood
from a wine vat. The overhead
chandelier in her livingroom is
constructed of an old iron wagon
wheel and iron bayoncts. The orig-
inal wooden beams are still present
as is the wooden stairway.

'i‘hc sluii'wny climbs up one wall
of the living room and the upstairs
hall is actually a balcony overlook-
ing the livingi'oom. Mrs. Gregg
fccis this house portrays the nt-
mospherc she likes.

The location is excellent for coni-
mutation to the Now Campus and the
only unticipnted problem is snow
removal during the winter months.

This is certainly one problem she
did not have to face while in Culi-
furnin.

When asked her reasons for com-
ing to Albany, Mrs. Gregg stated
that while she had a “fine expor-
ioncc at Stanford, it was time for
u change." She likes this geograph-
icnl area and felt that this Univer-
sity would “be going places," it's
in a state of “creative change."

 

The University of Puerto Rico
sponsors almost no extracurricu-
lar activities during the academic
year. Students there spend much
time engaged in social activity, but
primarily with their sororities and
fraternities.

The University sponsors only a
once a year track meet among the
four colleges on the island, the
Pablo Casals Festival, and a large
number of foreign films shown
throughout the year. its students
publish no yearbook, no paper, have
no football or soccer teams, and
lack almost all school spirit. This
spirit is transferred to the highly
select fraternities and sororities
which are very popular and very
active socially.

Greek Activities

These Greeks sponsor parties
almost weekly and often goin groups
to local beaches which are only
twenty minutes away by bus. in
Puerto Rico, the beach is not em-
phasized as a special place pri—
marily because it is so nearby and
available to the students.Surflng has
not yet become popular among the
Puerto Ricans, but one sees Ameri-
can students and military personnel
stationed at local bases occasionally
riding the waves.

Student spirit is evident at.only
two occasions during the year, the
track meet and during political elec-
tion campaigns. During these per-
iods, student frenzy reaches fever
pitch. At the time of the track meet
a large stadium on the island is se-
lected. The four competing schools
bring their best athletesto compete.

The banner waving crowds vigor-
ously support their universities at
this gathering.

During the political campaigns,
equal student partisanship becomes
evident as members of the Popular
Party (the largest and closest to the

Democratic Party in the (1.5.) com-‘.

pete against the Estadistas (State-
hood) Party and the lndependentista
Party for political office. Various
campaign caravans, similar to the
whistle-stop campaigns in the 0.5.,
tour the island for support. It is at
these times that student spirit rises
as candidates vie for office.

Organized Activities

Those other activities which are
school-organized include, in addi-
tion to the Casals festival and the
foreign movies, a theater group
which brings in such entertainers
as the Spanish Dancers and the
Chilean National Ballet.

The University does have a stu-
dent center which lnciudes a bank,
a post office, a barbershop, beauty
salon and guest hotel.

The actual social life of the stu-
dents, whether they are associated
with the Greeks or not, can be very
active. Many parties and get-to-
gethers are held on the beaches and
in local hotels. At these frequent
'gatherings the students dance the
merengue, a fast dance, and the
slower bolero, which is equivalent
to our two-step. They do notusually
dance our more popular dances.

American foods, such as ham-
burgers, cheeseburgers, milk-
shakes, and coke are becoming more
and more popular
