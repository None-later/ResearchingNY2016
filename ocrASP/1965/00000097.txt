Native Italian

Maria is well-qualified to com-
municate with the people and aid
foreign relations. She herself was
born ill ltaly. In addition to her
ability to speak ltaliall, shenllas
gained fluent control of the Spanish
language through her studies. She
also has a knowledge of French and
is beginning to study Portuguese.
Maria said that she loves languages
as displayed by her growing knowl-
edge of different tongues.

She considers the summer a bene-
ficial one. The discomfort and in-
convenience which she occasionally
encountered detracted little from
her total enjoyment of the exper-
lellce.

Family Revarance

Maria couldn't say enough‘about
the kindness and helpfulness of her
“family.” She referred to the par-
ents as "Mom" and "Dad" with the
same reverence and case with which
she speaks of her own parents. In
the short time she was there, Marla
acquired a deep sense of love and
respect for the Argentinians and
their country.

She also remarked that she found
Argentina a fascinating land with a
great deal of contrast. .

llnent’s philosophy which is 'by
introducing the people of one coun-
try to the people of another country
through the basic social structure
of the falllily — significant advance
toward world peace can be made
at the individual level.’ ”

Maria said that she would be happy
to talk with any one about the pro-
gram and will be giving lectures to
different organizations throughout
the semester.

Lifesaving Course

can Red Cross will open a senior
lifesaving course for girls at Hack-

added. She explained, however, that
there are some under-developed
areas which provide the contrast.

During the second month, travel-
ing included visits 'to major cities
such as Tucuman, Cordoba and Ro-
sario. This tour permitted Maria to
view the different parts of the coun-
try. In thia way she was better able
to understand several phases of
Argentinian life.

volunteer Construction Worlt

"The most valuable part of the
trip catne while working ill a volun-
tary work camp sponsored by Ar-
gentinian volunteers affiliated with
the United Nations," stated Maria.

The work entailed mixing cement,
carrying water and laying bricks.
These seem unlikely and difficult
chores for petite, attractive Maria,
but she didn’t seem to mind it.

"It was hard work, but it was
well worth itl At the same time we
played games with children and
taught them songs. The children
fascinated me with their eager de-
sire to learn the Englishlanguage."

This should prove good exper-
ience for Maria when she begins
teaching which is her ambition.
She is presently enrolled in the
teaching program with a major in
Spanish. '

the group had made any substantial

taro  _ ,

Today’s most popular sport among
’ the amateur critics of our foreign
policy seems to be a new version
of "Pin the Tall on the Donkey”
with the role of the target going
to the U.S.Staie Department.

The rules of the game are,
luckily for the participants, very
simple. The players first flip a
coin to decide who will act as the
proxy for the real thing, who is in
Washington and a notoriously poor
sport anyway. '

incidentally, it is unimportant who
wins the title role, since all the
players are well-qualified for it.

Luclty Defender
The function of the replacement
is to defend U. S. policy in a given
area, while the other players are
supposed to show him the obvious
mistakes in his argument.
Unfortunately,- it is often too one-
sided, since the lmpo'ster’s heart
really is not in his role. The game
is over when the inescapable logic
of the opposition has reduced the
hapless defender to whimpering lr-
relevancies about either national
honor or mass attrition, depending
on whether he is being attacked as
an imperialistic warlord or as a
card-carrying coward.

Logic

Any prospective players should
note that the key to the attack is
logic; facts are sometimes handy
but immaterial. Also, the game can
be easily altered so that the donkey
can substitute for other oganlzations
besides the State Department. The
rules are the same, only thejackass
is changed.

One of the latest products of this
vibrant English film scene is“Dar-
ling," a stunning new film produced
by' Joseph E. Levine, directed by
John Schlesinger, and starring
Laurence Harvey, Dick Bogarde and
Julie Christie.

“Darling” takes a penetrating
look at the modern day jet set —
tearing away the thin, paper-macho
veil that hides its true sordid face
and exposing it for all its hollow-
mass.

The world of “Darling” is a
wcrld of prefabricated pleasures,
of fast cars and fast people going
nowhere, of sex play that is as
meaningless as it is blatant. It is
a world where sense and nonsense
assume opposite values, where ir-

Arlin Science Institute
Attempts. Ari-Definition

4 by John Spross

“Whatever We Choose to callBeau-
tiful.....”

Art in Science, thepurrentexhibit
at the Albally lllstituteof History and
Art, is all exercise in the definition
of art itself; this striking exhibit
presents not only art-inspired-by-
Science, but also art-produced-by
science. The question “What is
art?" is posed (and then perhaps
answered) by a comparison of these
two sections of the exhibit.

in the first section, art of the
traditional media is displayed -—
ails, collages, sculpture. The var-
ious works in the grouping were
all inspired by lnodern science.
One sculptor has interpreted Cart-
esian graphics; another has styl-
ized a piece of modern machinery.
Area painters have contributed in-
terpretations of natural phenomena
such as the cell, solar energy, and
photosynthesis. Of special interest
was a work entitled “Primal Emer-
gence” by William Wilson of our
own art department. (This painting,
done ill Mr. Wilson's “musoled”
style, was awarded second prize
in the competition held in connec-
tion with the Art in Science exhibit.)
included in tilts traditional art-in-
spired-by-science grouping were
paintings by Mark Tobey and Was-
sily Kandinsky, and works of the
contemporary “0P” movement.

Unique Aesthetic Experience
‘However, it was the art-pro-

duced-by-science that made this
exhibition a unlqueheathetic ex-

perience. How often would a work
entitited "Oral Bacteria” he found
in Albany's Institute? And, though
titles such as "Dislocation Loops
ill Sodium Chloride Due to Electron
Irradiation" tend only to confuse
the scientific novice, hardly any one
could be unimpressed by the beauty
of the numerous photomicrograms
and scientific displays. What student
of art could have guessed that a
photograph of “Stacking Faults ill
Carbon” would look like a mono-
chrome lians Hoffman or that copper
casting freaks would resemblemuch
of modern sculpture? What artist
could have as deftly chosen the
colors in “Transparent Boron Ni-
tride" or have produced a gor-
geiously patterned work as “De-
tail of Beaver’s Tali?"

Overwhelming Beauty

It is tllls uncanny similarity to
moderll art and the overwhelming
beauty of these products of science
that make Art in Science memor-
able. By proving that both scientists
and artists are observers ill the
natural world, this exhibit implies
that scientists can act as artists
and artists as scientists alld that
the creation of beauty can never
be the claim of ally single group...

Flux and Flow

“WhateVer we choose to call the
beautiful in this new world, the
image is rooted in the flux and flow
of natural events.” This is how Dr.
David Barry, Chairman of SUNYA's
Atmospheric Science Department
and co-chairman of this exhibit, de-
fines art and perhaps answers the
question posed by Art in Science.

collection of short stories entitled
“Last Exit to Brooklyn."

Absurdity is Theme

Absurdity is the recurrent theme
as Selby howls against the impos-
sibility ofpurposeful existence. Such
a life of purpose simply does not
occur ill this book.

The language is, not to disappoint

Trapped Characters

Selby specializes in taking situa-
tions out of one of the days of his
trapped characters and recording
them for a posterity which wants
to forget about them or pretend
such things are the creation of a
demented writer who only had sales
on his nlind when he Wrote his
stories.

“Another Day Another Dollar" is
a story consisting of ten pages of
a discussion of cars ill the Greeks,
a section of Brooklyn. No plot, no
character development, no moral
(strictly speaking); just a few min-
utes worth of essentially meaning-
less conversation which sustains
the speaker's lives.

Ellectlvenass of Hell

When a writer sets out to pur-
posely thrust forth alieil, two things
may happen: either he will be ef-
fective — leaving the reader semi-
llauseus or he will be ineffective
alld the reader will leavehim barely
after they get inside the Gates.

Selby has tile questionable ability
to disgust a reader. The best story
ill the hook is “Traiala.” This is

a story of an adolescent girl/wo-
man who robs the men who pick her
up. Generally she tries to just get
them drunk and then take the money,
but she is not above batting them
over the head when they don't seem
to be cooperating.
Shocking and Brutal

Tile final scene of the story has
several illell abusing her. Here, the
descriptiotl, if that is the proper
word, is just overpowering. it is
by far the most shocking, the best-
written, the most brutal scene in
the whole book and one of the best
in contemporary naturalistic fiction.

This book fits into the category
of books you don't want to keep
reading but still do because the
scum that this Hell is made .of
won't let you go.

on stage

by Anne Digney

Among the groups which have recently struggled
for recognition on this campus is one which has
achieved special notice. Reader’s Club, which held
its first presentation in February of last year, has,
in a very few months. gained recognition not only on
this campus but in the Albany community and nearby
cities as well.

As a result of the inspiration of an exceptionally
enthusiastic teacher, Mrs. Olivia Donohue, several
students joined together and presenteda rather sketchy
reading program. Maureen Pearson, a junior at State,
followed through with her ambitious plans and working
with Mrs. Donahue organized several more programs
of gradually increasing merit. Within two months the
group has been invited to perform in Rome,New York
as well as in several surrounding schools. Theirpro-
grams included readings from Shakespeare, George
Bernard Shaw, James Thurber and Ernest Hemingway.

Cartoonists' Comment

The first reading of this year as presented last
Wednesday night. The performance. “Cartoonists’
Comment on Education, Politics, Humanities and
Warm Puppies," included readings from Jules Feif—
fer, Charles Schulz and Walt Kelly. Among the stu-
dents who read were Lynn Hewitt, Alex Krakower and
John Fotia. '

An interesting program has been planned for this
semester. The readings to be done here at State in-
clude Bohemian poetry with slides and music (Octo-
ber 13), Halloween montage (October 27), Heming-
way’s “Unmovable Feast (November 10). Sonnets
From Then and Now (December 1) and a Christmas
program on December 19.

Pocono Mountains
The group will appear in the Pocono Mountain Read-
er's Festival which will include colleges from all
along the eastern seaboard. Albany’s representative’s
will do readings from Eudora Welty’s “Lily Dow and
the Three Ladies."
