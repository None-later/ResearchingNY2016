Cross-country Coach Keith Munsey'felt that this
‘ year would definitely be a rebuilding year. He said
that the loss of eight of his top ten runners from last
year would be too much this year’s team to overcome
in the ’way of registering a good record. However, it
is apparent that Munsey errantly underestimated the
potential of his runners as several of them turned in
simply outstanding performances in the team’s three
wins this past week.

We do not expect the cross-country team to continue
its winning streak through the end of the season: how-
ever, we do feel that this “rebuilt” squad will prove
to be a credit to the fine tradition State cross—coun-
try teams have thus far established.

In all, the soccer games we have seen over the past
year, we have never seen a more determined, fired-
up, and inspired State team perform so well, for so
long, and for so little. For soccer Coach Joe Garcia,
the outcome of the game must have seemed an in-
justice to the performance of his team. The Dane
booters held their own against a fast and/ well-bal—
anced Quinnipiac squad, but the Staters lacked suffi-
cient depth to continually fight off the Indian drives,

As far as the AMIA is concerned — well, from what
we have seen thus far, it should be a dogfight among

five teams. Potter Club.

Kappa Beta, APA, Trinity,

and Waterbury all looked very impressive in the
league’s opening games, and it.isn’t too hard to
predict a close battle for the championship. The in-
terest among the players and spectators indicates
that AMIA football is as popular as ever at State,
and combined with the sterner competition in the
league this season, one can only conclude that foot-
ball will someday be “big-time” at Albany State.

Natyorganizes Weightlifting Cluh

Mr. George Nagy, head of last
year’s popular weightlifting club,
has recently announced that the
club is in a reorganization stage.
Here is a statement issued by Mr.
Nagy: ,

“Mr. Hathaway (Athletic Direc-
tor) iias repeatedly expressed his
wish that the club should continue
last year's successful operation.
He is willing to look for appropriate
aid and opportunity if there are
enough students to participate regu.
iariy, - ,

“We propose to get hours once
or twice a week at the YMCA; or,
we may open a room for the weight-

 

lifters and bodybuilders somewhere
on campus. We feel that the YMCA
would be better because it would
provide us with excellent facilities
and ideal health and work-out con—
ditlons.

“It would also enable me (Nagy)
to give instructions regularly and
try to set up a comprehensive team.

“Everybody who Is seriously
thinking of participating in the work
of the club should leave a message
in my student mail box indicating
whether he did weightlifting before,
his phone number, address, and
name. Immediate response is neces-
sary.”

Following Keeling to the tape were

Paul Durbln and Bob Flick. Durbin

in his first attempt at cross-coun-
try ran a fine race, and he was
named "Runner of the Meet" by
Coach Munsey.

Flick, who has been out with a
foot injury, returned to place seven
seconds behind Durbin, in 26:39.

The other Albany runners were
Bob Mulvey (fifth in 27:38), Ken
Kirik (eighth in 28:33),

,_ Garner (10th in 28:47).

The harriers now sport a 3-0

mark on the year.

Munsey was slightly disappointed
in the showing of Siena and Utica.
He was hoping the competition would
be a little keeper for his runners,
adding that he is afraid his team

might get a bit over-confident.

The fresh were paced by Don

Beevers, who was only 20 seconds
above the course record with a
17:55 timing over the 3.2 mile
course.

Beevers were Mike Atwell, who
paced the fresh in last week’s win
over Montclalr, Paul Breslin (4th)
and Bill Mathews (5th). The frosh
copped seven of the top ten posi-
tions.

OCTOBER 5. 1966

MYSKANIA ..im smog... pm,
To Revise Policy. for 1'66 Youth

Last spring, MYSKANIA made several recommendations concerning the“Torch” 
and its staff. Since then, some of these recommendations have been revised. These

 
 

_VOL. LI. 310.29»

revisions are no less strict than the original recommendations, but there are fewer
of them. They are as follows:
1) That the constitution of the “Torch” be reviewed immediately.
2) That a guarding philosophy, purposes, and procedures, prevmusly agreed upo
by Central Council, be added to said constitution.

Central Council, Recognizes SCOPE
Diousses Committee Reports

The regular meeting of Central Councu '"as called
to order by President Richard Thompson or. Thurs-
day, September 30. Two new members, Mrs. Egelston
and Dr. Rosenbach were welcomed, and sworn in by
MYSKANIA chairman Al Smith. With a quorum pres-
cut, the meeting proceeding with committee reports.

3) That Central Council
assume ultimate responsi-
bility for insuring adher-
ence to said philosophy,
purposes and procedures.

4) That if said philosophy, pur-
poses, and procedures are not fol-
lowed, Central Council take any
action necessary to ensure their
adherence.

5) That henceforth, all appoint-
ments to Student Association sal-
aried positions be approved by Cen-
tral Council.

These recommendations are un-
changed from last spring, however,
the recommendations. concerning
William Colgan’s position on the
staff, the circulation of the year-
book, and the "Torch" being en-
tered in competition have been com-
pletely omitted.

At the first meeting of Central
Council, these recommendations had
been referred to the Communica-
tions Commission. At that time, the
government was not organized to
any advanced operable degree, and
little action had been taken on these
ideas.

It is hoped by MYSKANIA that the
new government will take action on
these matters at once, for it “feels
that the scope of this situation ef-
fects not only the communication
media but also every student ma-
triculatng at this University...”

The recommendations to Presi-
dent Collins, and the Vice President
of Student Affairs have not been
changed. The major action in this
matter will be on the part of the
Student body, since Central Coun-
cil has been named as the group
responsible for ultimate evaluation.

Financial matters were
discussed by
Debbie Friedman. The first
problem discussed was that
of deciding who will have
the authority to sign vouch-
ers.
as yet, the, Finance Committee
has' not established a‘policy con-
cerning this problem, but ills hoped
the procedure will be defined within
the next week.

Miss Friedman introduced a mo-
tion which would provide for the
immediate appropriation of funds
($100) for each commission area.
This wouldd be for the cost of initial
operating expenses. At this point,
Dr. Knotts raised a question as to
constitutionality of the Religious
Affairs Commission.

In iils opinion, it is not within the
Constitutional right of the Central
Council to appropriate funds from
the general student tax (student
association funds) for the support
of a religious organization.

The American precedent in such
manners is quite contrary in that
it firmly believes in non-support of
religious organizations.

Discussion of this topic ended
with the appointment of acommlttee
to seek legal inforinatlon on the
subject.

SCOPE
Some controversy developed with-
in the Council concerningthe recog-
nition of SCOPE. Bill belie pre-

sented SCORE’sconstltutlon Recog; .

nitlon on the ‘part of Central Coun-
cil was deemed necessary, since
SCOPE had not been previously
placed under any of the present
commissions.

At present the organization can
operate only on a "limited basis."
In a dual purpose motion, Harold
Lynne proposed that Central Coun-
cil give the constitutionatemporary
approval “contingent upon"approv-
al of the Political Actions Commit-
tee.

New Publication

Ray Allen presented a plan for a
campus visual arts publication. He
stated that its purpose would be to
extend recognition to those students
and faculty members whose work
would not otherwise be made di-
really known to the campus.

Because this publication would in
essence be communicating these
works to the University, it was felt
that this was a inatter'wlthin the
concern of the Communications
Commission. At the Friday,0ctober
1, meeting of this commission, the
proposed publication will be dis-
cussed, and if approved, work on
it can be begun immediately.

Who's Who

Chairman Jack Kenny reported
that the activity sheets are ready,
and will soon be distributed to
Seniors. This will be done through
residence mail, and regular mail
to student teachers.

The deadline for returning these
sheets is October 18. The com-
mittee hopes to have a list of
nominees ready for approval by
October 21.

Grad Students

As was established at the Central
Council meeting of September 23,
Ed Brovarski and his committee
are presently taking a poll among
the graduate students in an attempt
to bring a report on the graduate
student's feelings about extra-cur-
ricular affairs on campus, and his
relationship to thorn.

This report, along with some
recommendations made by the grad
students will be presented on Octo-
begfgr'n Jones, co-chairman of Pen-
hellenic Council, stated that the
members of the body had been
elected.
