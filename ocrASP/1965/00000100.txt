pus during the late fall or early
winter to speak on the interrela-

civil rights legislation and has al-
ways been one of ilie body’s lead-
ing proponents of civil rights.

speaker committee, including,
among others, another evening of
freedom songs with the SNCC Free-

peat last year’s performance which

cessful programs. Tickets will be
sold for the Freedom Singers, but

programs will be open to the whole
university community and have no
