eta Professor of Education here
t'vState and ' a candidate for City

' tie man in last month’s Demo-.
 e "ti ~l?i"ini‘ary addressed the Free- _
 dom council during its weekly meet-

ng. this“ past yriev'ei'iing. Mr.

J. candles ran for Alderman of the .v

v Thirteenth {Ward (comprising all i
I, of Albany, past-of Main Avenue and

 from two :blocka‘ south of Clinton v

Avenue) along with the other Har- .
, der insurgentuDemocrats on an an- I
Eli-machine platform. This is only '

Ethe third time in the “year his-

serious Democr'atic opposition has
-. campaigned, and, of course, the
entire slate was defeated.

Mr. Ganeles, stated that he ex-
pected to See the machine exist in-
,tact for at least the next 15 years,
:but he was quite optimistic con-
cerning its gradual demise, es-
pecially starting in the 13th Ward
area. He said that he expects Mr.
Harder to defeat the machine in-
cumbent within several years for
the 112th=Assembly Distric't seat,
and that he, himself, although tern-

,porarlly defeated, certainly intends
fto continue campaigning and fighting
the machine.

in answer. ,to. aquestion concern-

”‘ing'Tthe ineffectiveness of insurgent

. campaigning in the recent primary,

’ a subject explored in a recent edi-
torial in'this paper, Ganeies said
that his group was hindered by lack
of both funds and of volunteer work-
ers. He said that over 505‘}. of his
workers were comprised of his
present and former siudentsin State
and at Milne. He asked for greater
support and stated that only by
constant year-round work and pub-

' licity can the Harder group succeed
against the firmly entrenched ma-
chine. Just the evening before his
speech, he had attended an organi-
zational meeting to begin work on
this very point.

Several people volunteered to
work for the insurgent group after
the presentation. Any other student
desiring to work for Mr. Ganeies
.can contact him through his office
' on the third floor of Milne.

F irebugs...

(confirmed [rom page i)
emphasis to this productién.

In a November 1964 review of
“Firebugs” Joen E. \‘adeboncoeur
wrote "The settings by Richard
Miller are so distinctive and beau-
tifully done in every respect that
theatregoers should study it for a
lesson in design."

Vadeboncoeur adde‘d “Hamilton’s
direction, following the line of ex-
treme theatricality, is highlighted
by stylized movement and tableau."

Another Syracuse critic, Seth
Shapiro, wrote that there “is great
symbolism in this dramatic work,
which“ is an allegory on Hitler’s
rise.... The two actors who Dor-
trayed the firebugs deserve special
credit... (They) make their roles
-credulous and play them with feel-
ing."

Town-Gown
The play Will be performed by
the Civic Company, aSyracuse com-
munity theatre group sponsored by
the Syracuse University Drama De-
partment. The organization uses
local talent and relies on the serv-
ices of professional directors from
Syracuse. David Hamilton is the

director for this play.

 ‘ meeting of the year Sunday at 1:30
.r in Brubacher'~Hali, Room 2.. The
i purpose of the mo‘eting is to solidify
' a working staff, to clear up any

"Primer'h will hold its first

doubts or questions about this year’s
"Printer," and to collect manu-

scripts. -
For many years, the literary mag-

' azine has come out once, at the and v

of the year. Sam Cypreesi and Bill
Murdick, co-edltor’s of "Primer,"
are hopeful that they will be able to
publish an issue each semester.

They feel that this change will

have to take place eventually as

g 

the University expands. They also
plop to provide space in the maga-
zine for faculty contributions.

“Primer” is dependent on stu-
dents for stories, essaysandpoems
for publication. Murdick and Cy-
pressi urge all students interested
in working on "Primer" to attend
the meeting. , .
