Associate Dean 5933 Lack of Image
As Major Problem of Transition

by Mark Cunningham

Mr. Sorrel] Chesin, the
new Associate Dean ofStu-
dents. believes that he has
detected a feeling on the
SUNYA campus that stu-
dents feel inferior, that
they belong to a second—
rate campus on the Amer-
ican collegiate scene.

This is a feeling with which he
does not agree. Chesin, who re-
places Dr. Robert B. Morris, be-
lieves that there are several ways
to correct this attitude. .

The new campus will tend to
serve as a great unifier. When the
entire student body is assembled
there and begins to work there
together, Chesin feels the unity
of the student body will grow and
foster better spirit.

The attitude of President Collins
towards the students will also be
instrumental in the correction of
the problem. President Collins, ac-
cording to Chesin, is most eager
to give students more involvement
in University planning aild guidance.

Other Institutions

Chesin States that “...at other
institutions, the only way a student
really gets involved is if he picks
up a sign and starts to march. I
haven't found that attitude here.”
Instead, Albany’s administration
views the student as capable of
helping and influencing the course
of the university.

Chesin believes that tile quality
of the faculty and the recruitment
of new faculty by the administra-
tion is becoming more aiid more
excellent yearly. According to him,
Albany is being publicized as having
an academic climate where the fac-
ulty can become involved in the
University Community with the stu-
dents.

Professors are also being at-
tracted by the opportunity to explore
their interests with academic free-
dom.

Cheslli hopes that all these fac-
tors will convince students that all

at work at his desk in Draper Hall, Room 108.

being spent here is not “...for sec-
ond class people...” As a result of
iiis_observations Chesin has been

impressed by the. “...quality and

caliber of the students.“

Areas at Work

Chesm’s position as Associate
Dean of Students involves lilm in
several areas of work. Among them
are internal research or the con-
ducting of surveys among the stu-
dents to determine the effectiveness
of university programs. His pri-
mary function involves him in the
orientation of‘llew students.

lie is largely responsible for the
total orientation program of the
University, undergraduate, foreign,
transfer, and graduate. ile also
coordinates the commuting student
advisement with Mrs. Gregg, the
new Associate Dean of Students.

Chesin serves as the Selective
Service registrar on the campus and
has cilarge ofdiscipiinary referrals.
Ills jurisdiction III this matter lies

mainly outside the residence halls.

Education

A graduate of SUNY at Geneseo,
Chesin attended New York Univer-
sity and the American Institute of
Banking. He received his M.A. from
Syracuse University where he was
on the Dean of Men's staff. He was
later Dean of Men’s Housing at
the University of Bridgeport, Con-
nectlcut.

He is working toward his Ph.D.
from Michigan State. He is inter-
ested in golf, basketball, handball
and soccer. His main hobby isbank-
log and finance, but he also enjoys
reading, particularly American lit-
erature of the 19th and 20th century,
and iii 20th Century American his-
ory.

Cilesin firmly believes that
. SUN‘l’A is on the brink of becoming

a great university. But the institu-
tion needs all image. “I think we’re
in the midst of changing the image

--- this is the interim."

‘ in. biology ci _
sored a fie'ldtrip last week-‘-

Aend to Rhode Island. The

trip was headed by Drs.
Stewart and Winn of the
Biology Department and
Dr. Baum of the Science
Department.

The purpose of the trip was to
study, gather, and classify marine
life, especially the animals and
plants found in tidepoois. The group
consisted of 32 students and eight
faculty members.

The group traveled by bus which
left at 2 p.m. on Friday, September
24 and returned to Albany 6 pm.
Sunday, September 24. They arrived
early Friday evening at the YMCA
camp in Wakefield, Rhode Island.

Down to the Share

Some members of Biology Club
decided to head for the beaches to
gather some specimens before
nightfall. Many students were just
anxious to get their first glimpse
of the ocean. The several places
visited during the weekend were
Scarborough Beach, Moonstone
Beach, Middle Bridge Salt Marsh,
Potter Pond Bridge and some lnud
flats.

Early Saturday morning, the group
Went to Middle Bridge Salt Marsh
to study the marine forms iii their
natural environment. The natural
environment for most of the ani-
mals studied was a tidepool exis-
tence. '

A tidepool is the water which re-
mains behind or is caught in rocks
when the tide goes out. During this
short period between high and low
tides, hundreds of plants and ani-
mals become active. Most of these
animals found in tidepoois are at
rest or inactive during high tide.

Animals Found

They become active during low
tide when they filter for food left
behind in the tidepoois. The most
common animals the students found
in the tidepoois were sea ,
sea urchin, scallops, sand dollars,
clams and mussels.

These animals survive on the tiny
organisms left behind in the tide-
pool. One of the most spectacular
sights was the illumination of the

entire shore by the millions of

microscopic bioluminescent organ-

isms... noctiluca and comb jellies.

While at Middle Bridge Illi qu_
denls found and studied horsesma
crabs, one of the most ancient
vertebrate alive today. The stu-
dents were also treated to the mag-
nificent sight of a flock of sea
herring taking off.

After gathering a snificielit
amount of specimen froin here, the
group moved on to Potter Pond
Bridge. While ilere, some students
went skindivingfor starfish, sponges
and different varieties of snails.

Starlish Numerous

Along the way to the beach, one
member of the group found a dead
muskrat which he proceeded to skin.
This was not added to the specimen
brought back for analysis by the
club members. However, the stu-
dents waded through tide swept wa-
ters removing dozens of starfish
which were clinging to barnacle
covered rocks.

The next stop of the day was at
the mud flats. Here the students

ciams. They gathered several
bundles of varied animals and plants,
especially kelps, to bring. back.

Sunday morning they left for Scar-

unique - the water, was a clear

beach was pure cream color with
no trace of sea sheil'particies.
Several types of star fish were
taken at tidepoois along this beach.
Among the common star fish were
many blood star, a starfish which
is bright red.

other species taken this day were

Building Better Bridge

by Harry Nuckals

This week at Bridge Club, thc
basics of No Trump play and rio-
fense were touched upon. AIS“,
practice hands were employed for
the first time. The hand which up—
pears this week is one taken from
that practice session.

The bidding sequence shown 15
imaginary, since bidding has not
yet been covered, but the illii'llilll
is sound and the filial contracl is
the optimum. The key to the [ﬁlm
of the hand is the diamond suit, and
the timing of the play must be per-
fect in order to fulfill the contract.

South should will the opening loud
in the dummy and start the din—
monds. If the suit is evenly dividl-Il,
he has no trouble, but when lanai
shows out on the second round, it
situation known as an internal him i.
develops.

If South is careless and l'llﬁlli"
a third high diamond, tln- lnulll.
round musl be won in the lllillll.l-.
and the South hand will null-r rc-
gnin the lead to cash lllt’USlilIlIl‘lliiHl
fifth diamond.

instead, after the first luu unn-
iiloiid leads, South should nidll
hearts. Assume West wins lhl- in -I
lead and returns a black sun. I‘lw

South hand is re-onlcrl-d um IIIt‘

Now, when South wills. lhi- hulll

hearts, he can unblock the diamond
suit by throwing away dummy’s last
diamond. In this manner, the two
low diamonds III the South hand are
cstablished.

If West holds up the ace of hearts,
South merer continues the suiluiitil
he has his needed three tricks, or
until West takes the ace. He must,
however, remember to sluff exactly
one diamond front dummy.

Thus, the South hand will win
two diamond tricks and three heart
iricks; while the North hand wins
the four top black cards.

Dr. Price Shows Concern,

Students traveling ill and about
Detroit Annex are accustomed to
seeing Dr. Harry Price, Jr. of the
Social Studies Department in alli-
mated couversation with students.
As most students realize, Dr. Price
is very interested ili each individual
student and finds time to know each
student while he also is an academic
advisor to undergraduate social
studies majors.

Dr. Price began teaching at Al-
baily in September, 1947. Among
the lnaiiy students who have been
fortunate to have had Dr. Price
are the present Vice President of
Studelit Affairs, Clifton C. Thorlie,
and one of Dr. Price’s own col-
leagues, Richard Kenall.

Former Students

Dr. Price described Mr. Kendall
as a typical A student, while Dr.
Thorlie was a B student. The first
office Dr. Price had in 1947 was in
Draper Hall‘where the old library
used to be. This office was a far
cry from the room he presentlyhas.

A native of Key West, Florida,
Dr. Price lived for several years
in New York City. He attended and
received his B.A. from Dartmouth
College. lie worked for the U. S.
Treasury Department for three
years while also studying at Colum-
bia University for his M.A. in his-
tory.

Dr. Price first taught high School
social studies in Charlotte, N.C.
and then iii lilverhead, L.I. Ills
