involve the Central Council in writing
thousands of policies and procedures
for everything from not placing pos-
tage stamps upside down to mandating
the hardness in the graphite in the
Torch’s pencils.

Central Council should take a sober
look at the, situation. They should con-
tact Colgan and especially Curti. These
are the people who will ultimately be the
source of whatever remedy is achieved.

Finally, the remedy must be achieved
through the proper channels, or the new
government will lose far more than it
could possibly gain by having a tightly
controlled yearbook. ,

A little background information is al-
ways a help in considering any major
question. In the case of the MYSKANIA
recommendations, there is a great deal
of information that can be studied.

The group’s second list of recom—
mendation does perhaps reveal some
measure of defendable thought: their
first list does not. .

This first list, issued late last year,
contained the virtual demand that Wil-
liam Colgan be removed from the staff
of the Tomb. The only way to remove
him would be by the process of im-
peachment.

It is this fact that impeachment is the
only method available which reveals the
extent of negligence of duty apparent in
most MYSKANIA rulings.

MYSKANIA had in effect ruled Colgan
to be guilty of unspecified high crimes
and misdemeanors. Yet it is this same
group of our intellectual and social elite

that claims that the Governor Alfred E.

on a page the number of which includes

'the numerals six and nine. We do not
accept the idea that the yearbook should
show pictures only of students and fa-
culty. '

The faults of the yearbook are clear.
It attempted to make a major‘change in
format in a short space of time. This
was bound to offend some members of
the University. The objection we raise
is to the poor taste in approximately four
captions.

MYSKANIA sits at the highest point
in this University. It is in theory the
cream of the senior class. Its recom-
mendation reflect fear and timidity.

The current MY SKANIA never asked
Bill Colgan or Steve Curti a single
question. Yet they presume to know what
is going through the minds of these in-
dividuals.

The current MYSKANIA attempts to
tell Central Council what to do about
the situation. They recommend that‘“a
guarding philosophy, purposes. and pro-
cedures, previously agreed upon by Cen—
tral Council, be added to” the constitu-
tion of the Torch.

Our biggest objection and the reason
we are most disturbed is MYSKANIA’s
apparent inability to fulfill its own role
responsibly.

As a judiciary, MYSKANIA’s greatest
obligation was to remain neutral during
any controversy that could result in any
legal question or any impeachment.

Even after this failure, MYSKANIA has
failed to act in a constructive manner.
It treats a proposal as a constitution.
If any group should know the difference
between a legal document and a piece of
paper, it is the judiciary.

MYSKANIA could have acted construc—
tively by seeking information directly
from the yearbook staff. Instead, they
acted in secret and without consulting
the staff or the editor. They even secured
their copy of the proposed constitution
without speaking either to Colgan or
Curti.

We hope MYSKANIA will withdraw its
proposals and admits its failure.

Pope Paul’s United States Visit

Enhances United

by Jim Begley

On Monday, October 4, Pope Paul
‘I paid an historic visit to the
United Nations headquarters in New
York. The object of his Visit was
"to bring hope and sustenance to
the yearning in the hearts of all
decent men and women — for
peace.”

The Papal visit is significant
since it has no historic precedent.
It is the first time a reigning pope
has visited either of the Americas.

But the Papal visit was not strict-
ly speaking, to the Americas. It
was to the 117 members of the Uni-
ted Nations.

At the tline of this writing, the
opinion is beliig expressed in dip-
lomatic circles that the greatest
significance of the Pope’s visit will
be (hopefully) to give a much needed
boost to the prestige of the U.N.

The occasion of his visit was
the twentieth anniversary of the
founding of the U. N.. As is usual,
the Pope's intent was drowned in a
deluge of advance publicity which
grossly exaggerated its importance.

Hi5 Opinion

The Pope himself anticlpated no
great return from his .visit. In a
press interview (another Papal
“first”) he told Alberto Cavallarl
of Milan’s Corriere Della Sera that
lie would just as soon have saved
the money that was spent on the
trip, but he could not pass up an
opportunity to speak to the “heads
of the world” as the representative
of Christ.

Although both the Pope and the
U.N. repeatedly stated that he was
not visiting as a head of state, the
Pope was received with most of the»
ceremony reserved only for heads
of state.

Likewise, reiterating the factthat
he was not coming as the head of a
major religious group, the Pope’s
message was colored by the doc-
trines of his Church.

Goals

In clear, Italian-accented French,
the Pope greeted the General As-
sembly and made an ardent plea
for brotherhood and world peace.
He asked men to put aside the
pride that inspires war and onmlty
among peoples.

Whllc hoping for total disarma-
ment, he acknowledged its imprac-
llcabillty as long as man’s "human
and sinful nature" remains what it

s.
The most obviously dncrlne-rol-

llalions Prestige

cred section of his address was his
assertion of the sanctity of life,
which included a plea to the world
leaders to stop pushing artificial
birth control.

Speaking before a group with widely
diversified religious opinions, the
latter statement was in dubious
taste. But we can excuse it and ad-
mire the Pope’s strength of con-
viction.

At the previously cited press in-
terview, when faced with a question
concerning the birth control issue,
His Holiness answered that this was
something on which he could not re-
main silent.

After the Pope's address there
was speculation as to the meaning
of his plea for “the brotherhood of
nations." Many interpret this as a
plea for the admission of Red China
to the U. N.

This writer would rather take
the stand that if the Pope had in-
tended to speak of Red China, he
would have referred to it by name
or at least in clearly identifiable
terms.

.
Temporal Has Been

Stripped of most of his secular
power and, in his own words, sov-
erlgn of a “Minlscule and, as it
were, symbolic temporal” state,
the Pope has become somewhat of
a living anachronlsm. But the power
he still wields over men’s minds
is again brought to evidence by his
address to the U. N.

With his late predecessor (whose
encyclicnl “Pacein in Terris” pro-
vided much raw material for his
address) Paul reflects a new trend
in Papal diplomacy. No longer com-
pletely couchiug his remarks in
centuries old diplomatic and re-
ligious cliches or isolated behind a
wall of palace spokesmen and offi-
cial newspapers, the Roman Pontlff
has publicly taken a stand on world
issues, welcomed the challenge of
the twentieth century and, clearly
outlining his policies, has offered
his cooperation to the leaders of
the world.

COMMUNICATIONS

With Tongue in Cheek

Dear Sirs: '

The land editorial lnlnsl Friday's
"ASP" said the Golden Eye, while
sponsored by Campus Christian
Council, “is by no means it narrow
or proselytlzliig program." This
was meant as fin endorsement, I’m
sure (Le. "Despite the label, it’s
safe to 30."), and perhaps even as
a compliment. However, I must
dissent. The Golden Eye is against

many things — intellectual sloth,
the moral cvnslous endemic to our
society. the ilognintisms of mass
culture, boorlslmoss and boredom,
Furthermore, it welcomes all who
share these prejudices.

So you see that which was. meant
as a compliment turns out to. be a
calumny. The Golden Eye lsproudly
narrow and in a world where choice-
souls are all too few, anoint actu'
vorts to its cause. .i i'

Last spring at the Cannes Film
.Fostlval, one of the major sur-
prises of the competition was the
awarding of the dualpr'izes for the
best actor and best actress to the
principals of the same film — the
winners were Terence Stamp and
Samantha Eggar, and the film was
William Wyler's "-The Collector."

Aside from the fact that this dual
award helped Great Britain sweep
four of the top five prizes at the
festival, (“The Knack” winning as
best picture and'"The Hill” for
best screenplay) it also represents
the first time in Cannes’ history
that the acting in one film has been
so dominant.

It is no mean feat to win at
Cannes. The competition is stiff;
the standards are high. Hence, the
performers that win there usually
have good cause to walk with their
noses in the air and their heads in
the clouds...usually.

‘ V > Honor to Wyler

’There are .times, however, when
the credit for a great performance
belongs to someone other than the
performer himself. In the case of
"The Collector,” the honor really
belongs to veteran American di-
rector William Wyler ("Ben-Hur,"
“The Children’s Hour.")

Inept Young Actress

When Wyler decided on Stamp and
Miss Eggar for thelead rolesin such
an important Columbia production as
"The Collector," much skpetlcism
arose, and rightly so. How, asked
the skeptics, could the boyish, in-
experienced, tilond-haired Stamp be

'recti'ng (in ‘The: ‘ Collector

passed off as Freddie Clogg, tne
brooding, demented kidnapper?

How could Wyler get Miss Eggar,
a notoriously inept young actress,
to project a faithful image of the
beautiful, sensitive Miranda? How
could he get her to project at all?
"The Collector" is strong testa-
ment to the fact that, in both in-
stances, Wyler did, and did amaz-
ineg well.

Odd Butterin Collector

,The plot, for those of you who
have never read the John Fowles
novel of the same name, concerns
an odd young butterfly collector
and bank clerk named Freddie Clegg,
who, after winning a fortune in a
racing pool, buys a secluded house
in the English countryside.

Into the dark, cold cellar of this
old house he brings a bed, furni-
ture, closets full of just-bought
women’s clothing, art supplies and
shelves of art books. Hls purpose
is to kidnap a lovely art student
named Miranda, bring her to this
place and keep her as his "guest."

Hates His Butterflies

After stalking tier through numer-
ous London back streets, he catches
her, cliloroforms tier and drives her
back to his hideaway in a covered
van, assured that they will get along
famously.

product of the “old” middle class‘,
and she, an imaginative, gregarious
soul, one of the “new people.” She
hates his butterflies and he despises

her "la-di-da” friends.

Mclonotliiin lecture on Art:

Change Is the Only Constant

by Gary Aldrich

Dr. Richard B. K. McLanathan
opened the new season of the Al-
bany Institute of History and Art
with a lecture on the topic "From
Pilgrim Days to Victorian:the Story
of Decorative Arts in America.”

McLanathan, who has traveled
extensively in Europe, used color
slides for the lecture. He began
by showing a portrait, by a Euro-
pean artist, of a forbidding-looking
woman named Ann Carter, who is
reputed to be the first Puritan to
set foot on the shores of the new
world.

The portrait represents her as

ing as harsh as the times and
conditions under which she and her
peers were forced to exist. The
most noticeable aspect ol‘Mrs.Car-
for was, however, that her features
were actually too harsh to be real.

Americans Point America

lie used this to make a point of
the fact that Europeans could not
paint Americans as they really were,
that only Aiiiorlcans could pnliit
America as it really was.

To illustrate filther, lie showed the
works of an Englishman, Blackburn,
and a portrait by Copley, nnAinerl-
can. Both portraits woreofihe same
people, bill Coploy’s was infinitely
more real. Americans tended to
point people in actual situations,
wlillo the English paintings were

can artists to become famous on

ington Ulster, ll Ronuiiitlclst who

till.

art for art's sake. The majority 0;
our artists try to imitate the Eur-
opean Schools.

For example, Thomas Jefferson
was not at all original in his de-
sign for the White House; it was to
represent a classic Greek temple.
At. that, Jefferson was considered
radical for his time.

Americans Portroy Noturo

Americans seemed to seek out
and portray nature. They grasped
the wonder of flowers, birds and
the untouched wilderness of the
West. ile demonstrated with the
real-life portrayals of Winslow
Homer and the idealistic Thomas
Cole, who added a classic and Gothic
touch to his visions of nature.

Maniiatban exhibited Sullle slides
taken from pictures painted by amu-
teur "do-li-yourself” artists. Al-
though this art was primitive and
quite comical, it seemed to have an
aura of surrealism about it. These
paintings, he pointed out, were also
true representations of the artist
and his imagination.

The art was "real American”
because it came from "the gut“ of
the artist and was not a fabrication
of some European style.

Breaking Victorian Tradition

The Victorian school, although it
was fought against by several Amer-
lcnu artists, remained almost lnos-
capable until the opening of the
twentieth century, when Arthur B.
Davis showed stark realism, not
only in his people, but iilso in their
environments, which ol'leii consisted
of tenements or dark illicys. This
came to be called lilo "Asli-Cnu
School," the study of life "on the
streets."

Unique, Frightening Vllloin
Under the skilled direction of
William Wyler, Terence Stamp's
Freddie emerges as one of the most
unique and frightening screen vil-
lains since the Norman Bates char’
actor in Hitchcock’s “Psycho.”
Samantha Eggar likewise turns
in a performance that is miles
yet one dreads what
might have happened had Wyler
not been there to browbeat her into
giving the performance that is now
safely recorded on film.
" Maybe Stamp and Miss Eggar
really did deserve the awards they
won at Cannes this year. After all,
they worked hard enough for them,
didn’t they? Besides, Wyler doesn’t
need another award that badly. His
mantle is so cluttered with stat-

hasn’t got room for another one

Its Responsibility

by William Gross
To the student familiar only with

Time, Life and Reader’s Digest,
The New York Review of Books is
a needed addition to his magazine
file.

The New York Review, published
weekly on ungliisscd paper, is n
journal of essays, criticism and
unrestricted drawings. It tends lo-
ward in radical viewpoint, contain-
ing articles on getting out of Viet
Nam, defending the Berkeley “re-
bels" and the Ililllillliy of "liber-
nilsm."

Responsible Attitude

Desplic its radicalism, ll innin-
talus a responsible altitude luck-
lng front most journals of the so-
culled radical press. Its contribu-
tors are usually iiieinliers of the

academic community.
Primarily, the articles are about
books and literature. For example,

a recent issue contained reviews
of "Viciorlaiit‘llles" by Asn llrlggs,

“Seeds of Liberation" edited by
Paul GOOflllli’lli mid "Cnsirolsni:
Theory and Practice" by Theodore
Drnper.

'l‘he lllllglilllll.‘ is made up nliiiosl
entirely of the contributions of

virtually has no staff other than the

editors and artist David Levine.
Frequent Contributor

Among its frequent contributors
are lions Morganlhau, critic of
American diplomacy; linul Good-
man, author of “Growing Up Ab-
suril;" Christopher Luscll, author
of "The New linilicallsm in Amor-
lcn" and Alfred Kazin, a noted
critic and journalist.

The New York lievlow is a good

by the popular press and are not
yet ready to use the learned jour-

One of the N most outstanding groups on campus this
year has been Dramatics Council. Unlike many of the
organizations. clubs and activities which profess to
want and need freshman participation, Dramatics Coun-
cil followed up their Activities Day introduction with
numerous letters and invitations to the freshmen.
A Dramatics Council reception was held to acquaint
freshmen with members of the council and the theatre
department faculty. Slides of past shows were shown
and refreshments were served.

Freshman Skit

In addition, members of Dramatics Council are co-
ordinating the freshman skit which is to be presented
on October 15.

At last, in one aspect at least, the aims of the tra-
ditional Rivalry activities are being fulfilled. Fresh-
men interested in theatre will have met and worked
with both students and staff of the department; they
will have received an informal initiation into “theatre
life” at State.

Wise Foresight
The department has indeed been wise in its foresight
of the problems which will exist in an expanding uni-
versity. No longer will a poster of two in the lower

peristyles attract more than a handful of interested'

students.

That this indicates a lack of initiative on the part
of the student body is an undeniable fact, but neither
can one ignore the myriad difficulties of an effective
communications system in ii “universitylntransition.”

To blame the student may be a valid accusation —
to trike initiative in building l1 department’s activities
may prove to be the only way to prepare a department
for its “new home.”
