, The committee, headed by John Haluska. News
Director of ,WSUA: Andy Mathias, Sports Director;
and. this writer have begun to formulate plans in this
direction. Our goal is to lay concrete foundations for
the'establishment, of football when the University is
finally settled out on the new campus. We know that
We mus begin now. .
it must be understood, however. that those students
presently enrolled in State will invariably never see

 

’ a State football game as an undergraduate. However.

what could bemore exciting than returning to a Home-
coming football game? ’ "
, No Club
The idea of club football was dismissed on the
grounds of insurance coverage and almost certain ad-

'ministration refusal of support. This must be NCAA

Intercollegiate football, beginning, perhaps. with a
fresh team in the fall of 1969 and backed up ‘with an

,administration-approved club fodtbali team for up-

perclassmen.

Then, in the fall of 1970. a Jayvee squad will be
formed. Later it will become a full-fledged varsity
team in the fall of ’71,

There are, of. course, several problems which
must be overcome and which further emphasize the
fact that this movement must be begun now. We have
for example, scheduling. Scheduling must be done at
least two years in advance. _

Coaching is a temporary problem, for when the
University expands to 10,000 full-time students, the
athletic department will undergo a tremendous ex-
pansion. Part of the expansion will be the addition of
many more instructors — very possibly phys. ed.
instructors with fOOtball backgrounds.

With most students'paying 31700 a year to attend
school here. a five dollar increase in the student tax
per year would scarcely be felt in the student's bud—
get. But this five dollar increase. based on an en—
rollment of 5,500 students. would give football a start
of $27,500.

Equipment Cheap

Equipment. which costs approximately 8150 per
man, would take up slightly more than a third of that
sum, leaving the balance for operational expenses
such as medical equipment. travel expenses. etc.

With unsubsidized footba11,as described above. State
would begin action with teams such as Oswego (which
will have a team in 1968), Union. RPI and Siena, and
later possibly entering into competition with Yankee
Conference schools under a subsidized football pro-
gram.

With the great interest and talent shown in this
year‘s AliIiA, Albany could field a fine squad that
would not take a back seat to anybody.

We could devote a whole column to the reasons why
Albany should have a football team, but we can sum—
marize it by saying thatii University of10,000 students
whose athletic program fails to bring the student body
together is failing in one of its major objectives of
maintaining such a program. Football possesses an
intangible quality that can unify a school like no
other sport can.

What Students Can Do

And now the all important question: what can the
individual student do? Alone—nothing: but united be-
hind this eommittee. he can show that there is an
immense interest in and need for the return ofnn
Albany State football team. This committee is truly
dedicated behind its goal. and it will not fold. it can
only full if the students so wish it to.

We have the support of members of MYSKANIA,
the student govornmenl. and the communications
media. Mint we need now is your support.

lndi 'ate in the ballot below if you want this com—
mittee to continue its work. lland it in at the desk
in the peristyles between 9:30 and 12:00 today.

1969 is a long way off. but we must begin today.

- The winning goal was
scored in the third period,

halfback Larre Nelson. He kicked
the ball past State goalie Paul llein-
ert at 10:30 of the first period.

The home team then increased its
lead to 2-0 over the Danes with a
score at 11:24 or the second quar-
ter. Engineer ,Jim Corbett accounted
for the score on a fine assist by
John Dunseford. .

State rebounded quickly, tying
the score within two minutes.

Dennis Jersey started the fresh
on their comeback surge with a
goal at 17:24 of the second quarter.
Craig Springer bolted home the
tying goal just ten seconds before
the gun sounded ending the half.

Corbett scored the winning goal
for Poly, his second of the game,
on a 2-foct bout at 8:17 of the
third quarter. ,

State goalie Reinert made 21 saves

APA. KB Share Lead
In AMIA Football Play

Alpha Pi Alpha and Kappa Beta remained tied for
first place as both teams recorded wins in the second
week of AMIA grid play. APA defeated Waterbury,
19-8, and KB overtook Adams House. 21-0. Potter
Club and Stuyvesant Tower also recorded wins, Pot-

ter taking TXO, 26-0. and the Tower men shutting out

TXO, 14-0.

Don Prockup’s passing
was again outstanding. as
he threw two long touch-
down passes of 50 and 55

' yards to his favorite target,

Steve Zahaurk.

APA's other touchdown came on
a spectacular 60 yard punt return
by safety Ray Cianfrani. Water-

. bury’s points came by way ofa 85

and a safety as a bad hike from the
APA center was recovered in the
end zone for 2 points.

KB's defense was again the story,
as they have yet to be scored upon
in league play. Tim Ambrosino, Jlin
Constantino, Rick Pierce and Bill
Gold played a fine defensive game,
preventing Adams ilouse from com-
ing close to its goal line.

KB’s scores came on 8 yard
passes from Dan Thomas to Buddy
Gates and Kirk Ellis, a 5 yard run
by Thomas, and a safety as John

Central Council Passes Bill '
For Organization Recognition

by Malcolm Provost
A new bill concerning
placement and recognition
of new organizations was
proposed andpassed during
the meeting of Central
Council Thursday.

The bill was sponsored by Richard
Thompson, President of Central
Council, proposed that a committee
would be set up to review the new
organization and decide where it
should be placed in the Student As-
sociation structure, and direct it to
begin writing its constitution.

This committee would be com-

~ posed of the Central Council presi-

dent and vice president and cabinet.
The bill takes effect immediately.

The second major action passed
by the council was to establish a
policy concerning who has authori-
zation to sign checks and vouchers
for groups under the commissions.

Signing Vouchers

The council approved the plan by
which the president and vice presi-
dent of Central Council, chairman
of Finance Committee, five com-
mission chairmen, and one other
member from each commission are
the only one eligible to sign the
vouchers. This plan will go into
effect October 14.

The Religious Affairs Commis-
  sion reported to the council that a

meeting with the counsel for the

Saturday Night

The Original Rag Quartet will
perform Saturday, October 16, in
Page Hall, The quartet is led by
pianist-singer Main Morath, dubbed
the ideal spokesman for ragtime by
"Variety" magazine.

After a highly successful opening
engagement at New York's famed
Village Vanguard in mid-1064, the
quartet moved into the college con-
cert field, where its unique and ex-
citing treatment of rag has cap-
tured folk and jazz partisans alike.

They have also appeared on net.-
work TV on the “Today Show" and
the "Bell Telephone liour." Also
they have had recording sessions for
"Epic."

Their show is kliit together with
a brand of humor and satire strictly
of the preseni, One critic of the
New York Post called them "sil-
pei'b” and their act “heart-stopping.
And it’s fun."

The program will conclude Par-
ent’s Day activities. The activities
will begin when the parents of the
freshmen class arrive at 11:80 a.m.

Tile parents will attend a luncheon
at noon and afterwards will be ad-
dressed by Dr. liohertMorris, Dean
of University College, and Dr. Clif-

She complained that today's news-

The director of the City Center

that Broadway was very alive, noting
that 27 plays are open or about to
