Judy Costanzo in the first half after
Hartwick had scored two goals.

In the second half with one minute
left, Connie Powers drove in the
second State goal. After the bully,
State drove down to the striking
circle, but because of the slippery
conditions of the field and a great
last second effort by the Hartwick
girls, Albany failed to score the
winning goal.

State’s team consisted of Kathy
Knapp, Betty Spinelli, Louise Bauer,
Linda Walker, Sue Emborsky, Caro—
lyn Pollack Dianna Bronson, Judy
Elliot, Sharmon Wazen, and Linda
Lindsenborg, captain.

a" by aggressive play and key injuries to both teams. '

period and Fred Gotham drove one
in at 10:04 of the same period.
