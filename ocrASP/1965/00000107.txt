- Enrollment Heavy
In New ? Program

Over 100 men and women have
taken advantage of a new program at
State University of New York at Al-
bany which offers advanced educa-
tion to residents of the capital area.

, The program in general studies
‘provides educational opportunities
for qualified men and womenbeyond
'ndrmal college age‘or for those
unable to attend college full-time
during the day. ' ,

In the group are tidy/omen and
58 men; .nine of' them are former

. students‘from the University. About
38 are graduate students.

Reasons for enrolling‘in the pro.-
gram vary. Most students want to
obtain a bachelor's degree while
others," many of them teachers, want
to gain more knowledge for their
present positions. Other-listed rea-
sons are personal department, con-
tinuation toward a master’s degree
or doctorate, interest in special
field or completion .of teacher cer-
tification requirements.

lrving Verschoor, head oi the
school of, library‘science, is acting
as administratioor of the new pro
gram and is assisted by Mrs. Jean
Boggs. ’ ,.

Under the program offerings of
the University are made available
to those not seeking academic cred-
it and to those non-matriculated
students who may wish'to earn aca-
demic credit in anticipation of ma-
triculatlon.

Football '
Football at Albany was the major

topic of discussion at Monday’s
meeting. Speculation that football
was being seriously considered had
been raised because of the appar-
ent reluctance of Merlin Hathaway_
'to discuss the topic in a WSUA in-
terview.

Dr. Collins stated that "nothing
is in the works, and if it were, it '
would not be in tin category of not
being discussed.” He went on to
Inpiliﬂ that me Athletic Advisory
Board has looked into the question
of having football for several years.
They have always run into theprob-
lem of inadequate facilities.

Now that the new campus offers
’the possibility of facilities for the
first time, Dr. Collins feels that
“we can really for the first time
look at the issue on its merits.”

‘A final decision to institute foot-
ball as an intercollegiate sport would
have to be made by theUniversity
Council upon recommendation by
Dr. Collins.

Budget Surplus

When the question of financing
football or any other new sport
was raised, Dr. Collins explained
that the Athletic Department usually
budgets a surplus fund which will
be used to increase the athletic
programs once the facilities on the
new campus are available.

The department already has a
surplus of at least $25,000. This
money had been set aside several
years ago to pay for brine pipes
under the tennis courts to convert
them to ice skating rinks.

Sue Nichols, Campus Ambassa-
dor, is available for speaking an;
gagements to any University group.
Miss Nichols spent this past sum-
mer living in lsrael as a member

Living. Her talk is accompanied

Nominations for the recently va-

systems to support” religious activitiesIDr. Knotts.’a
Central Council representative, first brOught the matter to the Counci

off;

He said it seemedaques- grew up, five arguments "for their
“on of constitutional heap ‘ efense. ’ it remains for the lawyers
My to support the Religious. to advise theRellgiousAffairsCom-

mission and Central Council on these
.Affairs Commission with arguments. They presented their
student tax funds.

case as follows: ‘
The student body is compelled to

pay the activities assessment, and
according to this line of reasoning,
they are therefore compelled to
support the Religious Affairs Com-
mission. In the case of an atheist
or an agnostic, Dr. Knotts ques-
tions why such a person should be
forced to support an organized re-
ligion’s activities.

Dolonse

l. Monies which are the respon-
sibility of the Commission on Re-
ligious Affairs, whether spent di-
rectly by the Commission or it
membership, shall at no time be
used for the propagation of an indi-
vidual faith or formal religious
group. The advisory board or cler-
gyman serves only as resource
people.

2. Two quotes from the Central
Council constitution show the neces-
sity of the Commission to have funds:
“The Central Council shall have the
power to determine student tax, to

‘ L" L general " ' ' policies,
to allocate funds, and to have ulti-
mate power of audit and control of
student finances."

“The Commission on Religious
Affairs shall be responsible for co-
ordinating, where possible, activi-
ties oi member organizations, and
assisting members oftbe University
Community in their search for faith
and spiritual understanding.”

3. Many other organizations which
do not claim full partlclpationon the
part of the student body receive fi-
nancial support from the Student
Association.

4. State University Colleges of
Fredonia, Cortland, and Jamestown
Community College have similar
student tax supported commissions.

5. The draft constitution of the
commission provides for admission
to the commission, any religious
group consisting of five active mem-
bers. In this sense, a group of five
atheists could join the commission.

Legal Question

It was mentioned that the Student
Body had passed the Central Council
Constitution which stated support of
this Commission as an inherent part.
This, however, was not "' uda
valid argument, for the article in the
constitution may be considered im-
proper and action could alsobetaken
on it.

To date, members of the Religious
Affairs Commission, members of
Central Council, and the Faculty-
Student Association lawyer, Mr.
Stein, have discussed the problem,
and Stein has taken the question to
the University lawyer, Mr. Crary.

Activities Halted

For the time being, the Commis-
sion cannot operate fully, due to the
shortage of money. Their constitu-
tion has not been duplicated for
Council consideration, because they
have no funds to duplicate it. Any
activity they wish to accomplish at
the commission level has come to
a halt.

This action stoppage is a neces-
sity, at present, for the legality of
the whole commission is now in
question. What started as aquestion
of student supporthas now developed
into a full scale investigation of the
Commission’s operation and pur-
pose.

For its meetings withthelawyers,
the Commission prepared a case
for the appropriation of funds. They
