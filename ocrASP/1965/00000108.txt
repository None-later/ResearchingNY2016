Freshmen Participate in

bers o/ the Class 0/ 1969 under
the supervision 0/ Pat Sip/o. It
contains a summary 0/ all (be
[resbrneri activities that have
occurred since the [rash entered
the University /our wee/es ago
and a [resbman's view of the
University.

On October 15, 1965 at 8:30 p.m.
the audience in Page Hall will wit-
ness one of the most fabulous events
of the year — the freshman skitl
it is entitled "Channel 69 Presents:
What Makes Freshmen Run or Stop
the Bus, 1 Want to Get Offl”

Written and directed by the fresh-
men themselves, it promises to be
a hilarious and exciting production.
The evening will be divided among
the sing, three short skits, com-
mercials and a news broadcast.

The first skit, "Fibber Macbeth
and Molly,” portrays acollege Eng-
lish professor, who wants to be-
come dean, and his nagging wife
Molly. Molly talks Macbeth into
murdering the dean, but Macbeth
still does not find happiness.

Man from SUNYA
- The go-go girls warn Macbeth to
beware of the man with the hairy
knuckles and Macbeth meets his
doom that night in the bar. "The
Man from S.U.N.Y.A.," under the
direction of Paul Bailey, is the
mysterious story of a missingclass
(Class of '09, of course).

Professor Psyco Path has prob-
lems when he finds his class stolen
by Miss men. The skit “Tipsy Side
Story“ is written and directed by
Ken Bernstein. it is a musical with

the words adapted to the songs from
"West Side Story” to fit the new plot.

The story will certainly be bene-
ficial to many statesmen who just
might identify themselves with the
main character. All students are
welcome to the free fun-filled eve-
ning. Sol Finn will be master of
ceremonies and narrator for the
production.

Jane Mandel is coordinating the
skit program and George Patter-
son is the technical director.

Freshman Sing

The Class of ’69 will present the
Freshman Sing in conjunction with
the skit tonight. The songs are par-
odies on popular songs describing
various aspects of our university.
“Them Quads," by Joanne Thayer
and Pat Carey, relates the story of
our new campus.

"Downtown," by Freda Scott,
sings of the “tales oftoiland misery
and strife there," and how “they go
Downtown, if they can get a bus.”
The frustration of the every day
grind is described in "it's a Hard
Day's Night," by Joanne Thayer and
Pat Carey.

One of our favorite is treated in
Ellis Kaufman's “We've Got the
Whole Meal on our Trays.” Un-
der the leadership of Chris Kaul
and Ellis Kaufman, the freshmen
have been working on this presen-
tation for three weeks. The Music
Council is aiding the freshmen with
this project.

Class Meeting

in frasliman class meetings, the
class of 1960 has been working to
revive those favorable aspects of
rivalry which had been discarded
completely. Under the leadership of
Anne Dignay and BillLaupdry,class
guardians, the trash have brought

Combination Minor

The combination minor is par-y
ticulariy ideal for students of Latin
American history and culture. For
those who wish—to teach languages
in the secondary schools, Mrs. Mon-
sour reveais*that Portuguese in
the high school curriculum is im-
minent. .

There is now a proposal before
the Board of Regents to introduce
the study of Brazilian Portuguese
in the high schools. This would
complement the new shift in em-
phasis in the social studies to Latin
America.

Mrs. Monsour is well-acquainted
with Latin America herself. She
lived for more than five years in
Mexico and lived for 15 weeks with
100 Brazilian and 10 American stu-
dents while on a Harvard scholar-
ship.

A Land of Ditierence

She describes the typical Brazil-
ian as “happy-go-lucky" and of
widely mixed background. It is this
difference of cultural diversity
which in some way accounts for the
modifications of Brazilian Portu-
guese when compared to its penin-
sula counterpart.

The South Portuguese accent even
varies from that of the North sec-
tions of Brazil since the language
has been altered by its close re-
lations with Argentina.

Brazil as a nation is now under-
going a tremendous drive to channel
its population out of the two centers
Sao Paula and Rio de Janiero. It is
for this reason that the new capital,
Brazilia, was created. Most of Bra-

Building Better Bridge

by Harry Nucltols

The situation was familiar. The
game was being played in the cafe-
teria. It was 12:05 and everyone had
12:20 classes. In order to finish the
rubber, a game had to be bid. This
explains the bidding sequence.

You see, N-S were actually play-
ing strong No Trumps. South over-
bid on his first and third bids, and
North under-bid on his second bid.
The double made South wish he had
considered his actions a little
longer.

The opening lead ruined any
chance for a cross-ruff so South
won East’s ten with the queen and
led a heart. West went up with the

zii’s interior remainsuntouched and» ace and returned the queen_ Dum-

undeveloped. The Brazilian govern-
ment is, according to Mrs. Mon-
sour, extremely anxious for Amer-
ican'asslstance.

However, when all is said and
done, one of the biggest attractions
Portuguese will have for students
at State will be the vivacious new
instructor from Tulane.

S mg, Skit
back the skit and sing. This program
will be presented to the University
on October 15, at Page Hall at 8:15.
The class meetings are usually held
on Fridays at l:30p.m.ln Page Hall.

At the past two meetings,Septem-
ber 24 and October 1, several groups
were formed to work on projects
such as the skit and sing. The
fresh have also voted to build the
float for the queen on Homecoming.
Committees for the float, publicity,
and a future class dance are com-
bining efforts to bring forth an ex-
citing freshman year.

my's king won the trick and a club
was led to South's queen and West
won the ace.

A club was returned and South
took account of the situation. Each
side had won two tricks. Seven
tricks could be won by winning the
club king and cross-rufftng clubs
and diamonds, but South needed
eight tricks.

If he put in the club ten and it
held, South would' make the rest
of the tricks by ruffing a club high
in his hand and drawing the remain-
ing trumps. The dummy would then
be high.

The trouble was that if the club
ten lost to the jack, a heart return
would be trumped by West and the
contract would be defeated. SoSouth
put up the king of clubs which held.

South now perceived that with a
3-3 club split, he could take the
rest of the tricks, and with a 4-2
split, he could win the balance it
spades broke 3-2. The hand pro-
ceeded.

 

A low club was led from the
dummy and ruffed by East with the
deuce. South over-ruffed with the
kingl Now a diamond was trumped
in the dummy and another club was
ruffed with the ace of spades, drop-
ping West's last club.

The spade seven was led to the
North hand and trumps were drawn.
Dummy's hearts and remaining club
were now good. Note that if South
fails to trump the clubs high, he has
no entry to the dummy to draw trump.
This line of play is known as a
dummy reversal.

While attending the University of
Wurzburg, the students lived with
German families. This gave them
an opportunity to learn more about
the people and also increased their
fluency in the German language.
The students found their families
very hospitable. During their stay,
the students were included in all
their families' social activities.

Patron Saint

Upon their arrival in the city,
theyparticipated in a festival hon-
oring Wurzburg’s patron saint. The
group from Albany State also at-
tended the University’s annual re-
ception, at which they were es-
pecially introduced.

Six'accredited courses were open
to our students. Among these were
included four courses in the German
language and two history courses.
Professors Barker, Kilchenmann,
and two native teachers instructed
the group from Albany.

courses.

was noted on his record. One of the
students commented that talking with
the German students at the Univer-
sity of Wurzburg was one of the best
parts of her visit.

The Mensa Cafeteria at tne Uni~
versity proved to be an excellent
place for socializing with class-
mates not only from Germany, but
from other countries and continents.

The students spent six weeks
studying at the University. While
they were there, three weekend ex-
cursions were available to them.
This gave them an opportunity to
observe more closely the cultural
and historical aspects of the coun-
try.

Fresh Reviews Experiences

by Connie Field

Being a first year college student
involves more than being called
“frosti.” Now that We are all offi-
cially freshmen, what comes next?

Tile first experience encountered
at SUNYA is dormitory life. The
various degrees of good and bad
which result depend upon different
sets of roommates. More than just
leaving home, community living is
a lesson in responsibility, common
sense and patience.

Dormitory directors and college
officials feel that dorm life is “an
integral part of college life." Next,
the main reason for most of us
coming here, is to learn. Unac-
customéd to college teachers and
the work involved, many fresh were
shocked the first day. Many are
still shocked.

Several "All Nighters"

Although they wore tempted to
leave after the first day, they are
still hero. The courses have not
become any easier, but the fresh-
men have suddenly become smarter.
By now, quiet hours are beginning
to pay off and many have already

pulled “all nighters.”

On September 18, all freshmen
were introduced to the campus or-
ganizations at the Activities Day
program in the Alumni Quad.'stu-
dents may have signed up for many
of them or none at all. The main
reason for these clubs is to benefit
SUNYS students.

The (-lubs are an outlet for the
students’ energy and expression, and
provide a place for them to enjoy
themselves by doing what interests
them. However, college organiza-
tions are not going lo come begging
for new members.

if a student really wants to reap
the benefits of any specific club he
must forget those freshman inhi-
bitions, and find out for himself
what is going on. It's up to the
freslnnan to become a part of the
university.

to cross into East Berlin via Check-
point Chariie. There an East Berlin
guide met them With a bus. The stu—
dents found the tour very interesting.
One of them noted that the guide took
particular care to show the group
only the more modern developments.

The courses at the University con-
cluded on August 14. At that time
several students took advantage ofa
field trip sponsored by the program.
The trip took them through Austria,
Italy, and France. In Austria they
visited the Mauthausen Concentra-
tion Camp.

Wine Festival

They arrived in Vienna to cele-
brate the annual opening of the new
wine. Another high point was a gon-
dola ride in Venice. Most of the
students agreed that the short time
they spent on the Italian and French
Rivieras was very enjoyable.

The trip ended with a nine day
visit to Paris. The group arrived
back in the U. S. on September 6.

Peace Corps Volunteers Offer
Facts, Information to Students

A Peace Corps display is new
setup in lower Draper hall. The
students in charge of the display
are ex-Albany State students. Any
student who has the slightest in-
terest in the Peace Corps should
stop by and pick up several of the
available pamphlets.

The pamphlets cover many areas
of the Corps work. One pamphlet
entitled Peace Corps Facts notes
the history, requirements, salary,
term of service, and general pol-
icies of the Corps. This leaﬂet
tries to answer most of the ques-
tions students are likely to have
concerning the organization.

Specialized Areas

Several pamphlets are designated
to appeal to specific groups. Of
particular interest are those ad-
dressed to teacher, college juniors,
and married couples. The leaﬂets
are even more specific. They offer
information on placement in spe—
cialized areas of study or interest.

Liberal arts students are encour-
aged io apply. The Peace Corps can
and will train these students to
function in a wide variety of areas.
Language majors or anyone inter-
ested in languages has the oppor-
tunity to learn one of forty—one
languages taught by the Peace Corps.

Mathematlc and science students
are strongly urged to join the Peace
Corps. Most underdeveloped coun-
tries are lacking in these areas and
these are extremely important in
building up the economic stability.

Praiesslonuls Needed
Earth science and geology are
the most significant contributors
in the Peace Corps. Latin Amer-
ica, Africa and Asia are contin-
uously requesting professional help

in those areas. Educational and in-
dustrial progress are not the only

areas where the Peace Corp comes

in.

Many countries lack community

Trio Reveals Toast Technique
Tells Better Buffering Way

by Amos, Andy and Clyde

The mystery of how to get also
to melt on Food Service toast has
been solved. The ASP has been in-
vestigating this situation for years
and has arrived at a consensus.

The process is a bit complicated.
We therefore suggest that the stu-
dent attempting this feat cut this
article out and rehearse carefully
before attempting the actual thing.
(Even one failure has proven fatal

to an insecure R.A.).

Process

The first thing to do is to get a
tray. if you can find a dry one,
this is miracle, but no help. Pick
up two bread and butter plates.

government. This work carries over
into many of the other areas as ed-
ucation, health, industrial and so—

cial services.

Students interested in specific
rather than
duties should pick up the leaflets
on the major areas where the Corps
is working. These include pamphlets
on Africa, the Far East, Asia and
Latin America. The Peace Corps
representatives will gladly answer

geographical areas

any student’s questions.

Place them in separate areas on
the tray.

Get your cold bread and napkins
in the usual fashion. Get three or
four patties of oleo and immed-
iately remove the paper tops. This
will allow a few calories of heat
to enter the oleo.

When you get to the bin where
the toast is thrown, have some ex-
cuse to wait around ready. This is
so you can get toast right out of
the machine.

Furious Pace

Once this happens the real action
begins. You thrown one piece of
toast on one plate. You immediately
throw all the patties of oleo on this
one piece of toast. This base piece
is then covered with another piece
of toast and with the extra bread
and butter plate.

You get black coffee, because it
is hotter than that diluted with cold
half and half. You leave the saucer
under the cup and place the toast
holding plates over the coffee.

Willi any luck, your toast will
have melted oleo. It will be a little
soggy, but that's the price ofluxury.

If, however, you are not willing to
pay the price it is advisable to go
to the nearest coffeehouse and pur-
chase a cup of coffee and order of
toast.

This does not guarantee a better
quality but at least you have the
choide of continuing your patronage.

 

Chess

0f the various openings of the
king pawn the Ruy Lopez is prob-
ably the most effective and widely
played. The general object of open-
ing is to win material through ex-
changes and gain control of the

the four squares in the middle of
the board.

Both players must be apprehen-
sive of the traps provided by tho
