, frurlite Freshmen

Each year there is a new freshman
This is such a truism that it

This year the freshman are already

disappearing into the rest of the stu—
dent body. There are no ugly beanies
to attempt to point them out. The lost
look which usually characterizes frosh
has been replaced by an at-home look
in the eyes of most of the fresh.

If it were not for gym suits and a few

standard frosh texts, we would be unable
to spot freshmen at all. This is notice-
able to us as newspaper editors since

.we usually attempt to watch the pro-
gress of the new class.

This year this progress has been so

rapid that we can already conclude that
the fresh are an integral part of the
University.

This new class had several things in

its favor in accomplishing in four weeks
what usually takes a semester. To begin
win people are leaving high schools with
little of the naivete which charaterized
high school graduates as recently as
just three or four years ago.

The attitude of the fresh is another

plus. They are interested in most facets
of college life. They do not seem to share
the traditional frosh fears that no amount
of work will obtain passing grades. Here
again we find the frosh realistic.

The frosh orientation program cer-

tainly seems to have played a major
role in helping the frosh integrate them-
selves into the student body.

conferences are obvious in ways now
that they could not have been a few
weeks ago.

We are delighted to see the frosh in
the position they are now in. It bodes
well for the students themselves. the
University and the organized activites
of the University.

[in the Right Track

The committee report of the Com-
munications Commission’s ad hoc com-
mittee reveals the common sense and
constructive attitude we have been hoping
for. 0

The committee does not make a fas—
cistic demand for censorship.

The committee does not treat the
Torch staff as immoral incompetents.

The committee does not attempt to
convict anybody without a trial.

The committee does make positive
proposals. They recommend things which
have already been done by Editor Curtl
and his staff, but they are proposals
which could well be made a permanent
part of the Torch procedure for setting
up its book.

We feel that the ad hoc committee has
made good use of Curti’s proposals as
expressed on these pages last Tuesday.
We hope MYSKANIA will accept their
defeat gracefully.

The proposals made by MYSKANIA
were based on types of reasoning we
cannot admire. The ad hoc committee’s
report was based on the logic that the
Torch staff puts out the Torch. What
could be more logical than that?

We wholeheartedly congratulate the
Communications Commission for ac-
cepting the report of its ad hoc group.
We hope we are at an end to this con-
troversy.

V ‘lry D. Cordon Uphom

The ever-expending war in South
Vietnam has produced many myths
and distortions of the actual events
and of the circumstances which
make us fight a war in which we
have committed over.ldo,000 men
and have spent large amounts of
money.

It is popularly believed that the
men we are fighting against are
soldiers who are part of the North
Vietnamese Army.

This is not true and has never
been substantiated. The Adminis-
tration has claimed that elements
of the 325th Division of the Army

 

V of North Vietnam are present in

Binhdinh province.~ ,

It would be sneer folly for North
Vietnam to send part of its army
into South Vietnam. The war has
been decidedly favorable to the guer-
illas, and North Vietnamese in-,
volvemsnt would only serve to ex-
cuso our bombings of North Viet-
nam.

Who Are the Viet Cong?

The White Paper issued by the
state Department after the expan-
sion of the war to North Vietnam
maintains that a large number of
men have crossed into South Viet-
nam from North Vietnam who were
natives of the North. Yet it can
substantiate only six cases of na-
tives from North Vietnam being
present in the South.

Out of the total number of cap-
tured Viet Cong, this is an absurd
fraction. None of these were mem-
bers of the regular army.

 
 

 
 
 
     

it "  llot‘  Com-

munists. They are mostly‘pesssnts
who are willing to fight for land
reform, million freedom, and an
end to Sslgon's tyranny. They view
themselves as patriots fighting for
control of their country. ‘

  

 

North Vietnamese Aid

The White Psper referred to above
tried to rationalize the bombing of
North Vietnam. It states that "in-
controvertible evidence of Hanoi’s
elaborate program to supply its
forces in the South with weapons,
ammunition and other supplies has
accumulated over the years." The
figures released by the Pentagon
seemed to deny this, however.

From 1962 to 1964 we captured
15,100 weapons from the guerilias
and they captured 27,400 weapons
from U. S. and South Vietnamese
forces. in an eighteen monthperiod
we captured about 7500 weapons
from the guerillas, but of these
only 179 were not made in the
United States or South Vietnam.

Of these 179 weapons, only two
were made in North Vietnam and
24 were French weapons which had
been “modified” in North Viet-
nam, according to Pentagon figures.
ls this “incontrovertible evidence
of Hanoi's elaborate program?"

Note: The New York Times on
October 13 gives the results of a
trap which was supposed to crush
the 325th Division: “But the North
Vietnamese 325th Division, the tar-
get of the assault was nowhere to
be seen.”

 

 

Article Distorts Facts

To the Editors:

We would like to clear up any mis-
conceptions which may have been
conveyed in the article of October 1
about us as exchange studepts in
Ruerto Rico.

We feel that the negative aspect
of our experience was over-em-
phasized and that the affirmative
was neglected.

The tone of the article was in
complete contrast to the impression
we had hoped to give of our year.

In light of our wonderful exper-
iences and happy memories of Puer-
to Rico, we find it easy to overlook
such trivialities as food not famil-
iar to our tastes.

Besides increasing our knowledge
of Spanish, we profited by partici-
pating in the Puerto Rican way of
life. We were fortunate enoughto
be received in several Puerto Rican
homes and to travel over the entire
island.

The fact that student activities are
not as numerous as in American
universities is compensated for by
cultural school activities and close
family life.

We regret that any readers may
have received a mistaken impres-
sion. We sincerely hope that any
misconceptions have been cleared
up by this letter.

Sportsmanship Counts
To the Editors:

ln watching last Saturday's soc-
cer game between State and Mont-
clalr, i witnessed a hard played
game by both teams. However, the
Montclair team played, in my es-
timation, an extremely unsports-
mallllke game. Numerous penalties
were called upon the Montcialr team,
and three of their men were elected
from the game, including their
goalie, who had the audacity to throw
the ball and "charge" after one of
the referees after a disputed call.
i feel, however, that the State play-
ers throughout the game conducted
themselves like true sportsmen.
Not once did they let the “dirty”
play 0‘ Montclalr get the best of
them, and when the goalie attacked
the referee, they did not start a
wild melee with the other team,
but calmly organised themselves.
As for the Montclsir goalie, lfeel
he should not be able to ever again
participate in intercollegiate athv
latics because of his most outrag-
eons actions. _

i must pay special tribute to

sportsmanship on the part of the
State team. lfeel that sportsmanship
is developed by the coach and re-
ﬂected by the players on the field.
State may not have the finest soccer
team in the country, but it can be
quite proud of having some very
fine citizens on and off the playing
field.

Soph Party lacks Beer

To the Editor‘s:

Sophomore beer party? What beer
party? We were at Hunter Ski Lodge,
in the Catskills, on Saturday. We
saw the mountains (a beautiful view),
rode the chair lift, admired the
lodge, listened to the band in the
evening - but we saw no beer party.
Some people did, and their condi-
tion on the way home testified to
the fact. But they were the ones who
had the money to buy beer from the
management, or who had transpor-
tation to go elsewhere and get beer
at more reasonable prices (this, of
course, was not condoned by the
proprietors). We, personally, had
spent what money we had on food
for lunch and supper — so we did
without beer. No one had told us
we would have to pay for beer in
addition to the tickets; in fact, we
have never before seen or heard
of such a beer party. Where did
that ticket money go? For the at-
mosphere and for the busses (in-
cluding an eleven o'clock return
trip which was cancelled at 10:45).
We would have cheerfully settled
for our beer and some place near
enough to Albany for girls to have
been sure of being back by 3 a.m.

We got a pretty lousy deal. Neither
of us appreciated ll.

Waterbury 'Boys’?

To the Editors:

It is now 3 o'clock a.m. Sunday
morning. About an hour ago, i went
to sleep but have since been
awakened by a few boys, not men
but boys, who were singing “Let it
Snow, let it Snow." Of course, one
has to have fun in collge, but not at
the cost of bothering others. This
is not the first of these incidents.
They have occurred every single
Friday and Saturday night since I
have arrived here. The worst of it
was last Friday night. A group song
at the top of their lungs, “Gee Offl-
cor Krupke."

Most of these boys are residents
of Waterbury. I'm sure that some
of the families on Western Avenue
are bothered by this problem too.

 weasel.- Rothgeb

A'few years ago, when Harry
Ssltzman and Albert Broccoli re-
leased the first James Bond flick,
“Dr. No," audiences thrilled to it.
"From Russia With Love” was a
similar success and “Goldfinger”
was a box-office blockbuster.
“Thunder-ball," soon to be released,
should provide still further proof
that the Bond formula is the sound-
est one going in the movies today.

The formula is so potent, indeed,
that a good many other producers
have found its exploitation not to be
unprofitable.

As a result, the movie and tele-
vision screens have lately been
flooded with offshoots of the Bond
prototype. Such characters as Na-
poleon Solo, lllya Kuryakin, Harry
Palmer and Maxwell Smart are now
almost as familiar as the legendary
Mr. Bond himself.

Net a Professional

Nicholas Whistler may not sound
much like a spy’s name, but Nicholas
Whistler, too, is a spy — well, sort
of a spy, anyway. His code name
is “Agent 8 3/4," and although that
may sound very professional, Nicho-
las Whistler is anything but profes-
sidnal.

Actually, he’s an unemployed
writer who takes the job of envoy
for a British glass company under

the naive impression that he is
being sent to Prague, behind the
lron,Curiain, as an innocent trade
delegate.

Yet, he is told by his employer
that the negotiations must be ultra-
secret, and he is even given apass-
word (“it’s hot enough for June”)
by which he is to contact the other
delegate. The glass company is
really a front for the British Secret
Service, and his employer is really
a top British agent, sort of an over-
stuffed "M." But Nicholas Whistler
doesn’t catch on, and so goes mer-
rily off to Commie-land thinking
himself totally legitimate.

No Prize Winner

As a spy. even as a spy that
doesn't know he’s a spy, Whistler is
no prize winner. He calls up his
“employer” via a telephone line
that is supposed to be top-secret,
and he overanxiously givestllepass-
word to practically everyone he
meets, including a washroom atten-
dant.

But it turns out that the washroom
attendant is his contact and is, in
truth, a secret agent. The agent slips
the but information to Whistler who
has only at that moment discovered
that he is a spy.

Loves Daughter
As would be expected, he falls in
love with the daughter of the Chief
of Secret Police, and winds up being

'The firebugs’

Comments on Nazi Beosiiuliiy

by Bruce Daniels

The University's theatrical sea-
son opened last Friday night with
what might have been a mordant
spectacle of bourgeois self-decep-
tion but was, instead, a tired, tooth-
less “comment” on the Nazi Beast.

Besides threatening to break out
at any moment into a musical com-
edy, Syracuse University’s produc-
tion of “The Firebugs” seemed to
transport a genuinely disturbing
drama into the benign moral uni-
verse of Stanley Kramer.

No Volkswagens for Thinkers

My guess is that all right-think-
ing individuals ill the audience ran
out immediately after the perfor-
mance and did not buy a Volks-
wagen. And what‘s—more, felt good
about ill

Part of this moral and dramatic
flabbiness is culture-bound, but a
piece of the responsibility belongs
to the director, David Hamilton, and
his narrow interpretation of the
playtvrighi's text.

Self-Congratulation

Culturally, we have apparently
reached the point where sllnpie
awareness that the Nazis existed
is cause for self-congratulatiml.

We linger over the arcane, fos-
silized symbolism of the historical
Nazis to avoid the distressing pos-
sibility that somewhere, deep inside
us or just beneath the surface,
there is a living beast.

The director contributes to this
cultural defense—lllecllalllsm by
fleshing out the allegory of “The
Firebugs" with some highly visible
swastikas, all SA-typc bl‘ownsllil't
and (just ill case we missed the
point) slide—pictures of Hitler.

Max Friscll, the Sales author of
“The Flrebugs," seems not to have
intended a specific condelllnatloll of
the Nazis, but rather a more gen-
eral study of the middle class and
its failure of nerve. Thus the play
opens ill an unspecified community
recently plagued with a number of
unexplained cases of lift-it‘ll.

Gotlliell Bledel'lllalm, a prosper-
ous but morally bankrupt r:iilr.en(i:c
has just fired all old loyal assistant
for no apparent reason and indirect-
ly caused ills deaill)alluwsaslrang—
or to wheedle and bully all "invita-
tion" to Bledel'lnaml’s house.

Notions of Propriety
The stranger makes himself at
home, dropping enough hints 10 make
Bledsrmann and the audience feel
uneasy and suspicious. Bledermnlul,
however, will not or cannot act on
his silsplcion --- owing to his fear

and superficial notions ofproprleiy.

A second stranger soon appears
bringing barrels of gasoline with
him, leaving no doubt in the aud-
ience’s mind that these are the
firebugs. Biedermann still refuses
to act and resorts to still wilder
rationalizations for his impotence.

Biedermann, insisting all iheiime
that he is in control of events, is
forced to recognize that he is the
servant of the firebugs (in a scene
at the dinner-table which neatly
sums up all the prior action).

Even confronted with the truth,
Biedermann further seeks ills ut-
terly avoidable “fate” by handing
over the matches to light the last
and greatest conflagraiion of all.

The final, towering irony comes
with the epilogue. After perisiling
in the great fire, all the charac-
ters find themselves in Hell. Re-
fusing to believe that they deserved
such torment (or rather such no-
toriety), the citizens busy them-
selves with reconsiructing an exact
replica of the peaceful, prosperous
town we saw all the start of the play.

The guilty nightmare of wader-
malm is thus transformed into a
comfortable, but far more horrify-
ing, daydream of a society without
a past, without a sense of guilt.

All this was played in a comic
manner, as a kind olmock-murallty
play, against the background of a
cleverly designed Expressionist set
(which was dismantled and recon-
structed ill a slick but occasionally
mechanical parallel to the action).

The characters of Biedermann
and his maid, Anna, were played in
the broad manner of a high-school
music-ale --- though it. is only fair
to say that Biedel‘mqlln (David Fen-
drick) was lllore justified in his
overaciing than Anna (Gail Drynes).

As Elsenrillg (the second firebug),
Richard Nathan did the most cred-
itable acting job Ill the play, cre-
ating a sinister charm and a mo-
ment or two of genuine terror.

Keystone Kops

The best moments, illuugh, came
from the interplay of the "chorus"
lulu lliedermaml. Composed of fire-
mcll resembling the Keystone Kops
and ordinary townspeople, the
"chorus" pcl'celves the danger long
before Bledermanu, tries to warn
lllln, but In the long Hill is as
foolish, inept and guilty as the
"hero" himself.

Again, the llluseum-piece mur-
alin of slide projections asa shori-
llalld way of telling us what the
play was "about" might have been
rejected in favor of sharpening the
direction and ions of the drama
proper. As it was, “The Fil'obugs”
mlsfired.

of disguises that range from s
wslter's coat and tails to a milk-
man's uniform.

Eventually, of course, all works

out well, and- he "not only gets

asylum in the British Embassy and
passage back to England, but wins
the Chief of Police’s daughter as
well.

Inadequate as Spoof

“Agent 8 3/4" is not exactly the
best spy picture every made, nor is
it the most exciting. As an espion-
age movie lt is good, and as a
comedy it is only fair. And although
its title may suggest a rousing ss-
tlre on 007, it turns out, in fact,
to be most inadequate as a spoof.
Strangely enough, the scenes where-
in Whistler is being hounded by the
police are more entertaining than
most of the satire.

This is not to say that "Agent
8 3/4” is a complete flop. On the
contrary, most of the time it is
quite entertaining, and should prove
disappointing only to those who ex-
pect too much from it.

The cast, headed by the indestruc-
tible Dirk Bogarde, and featuring
Robert Morley, Sylvia Koscina and
Leo McKern, is the picture’s big-
gest asset, and the film's technical
aspects are likewise good.

Although the possibility exists,
it is not likely that anybody will be
pr'oducing a sequel to “Agent 8 8/4."
Nicholas Whistler never could be
much of a match for 007, and it would
hence be wise for Nicholas to get out
while the getting is good.

Nureer Performs

“Le Vaise" composed by Maurice
liael was the first excerpt, and it
starred the entire company. The
setting was a grand ballroom and
the artists depicted the movements
of the carefree dancers quite well.
Opening with clouds of smoke ob-
scuring the dancers from View,
the dancers started with slow mo-
tions which picked up, to a more
rapid pace as the smoke cleared.

Poor Sclcctlon

This was the poorest of the se-
tills reviewer’s esti-

lecllons ill

the ﬂuidity of the dancers motions.

The Chopin and Hall arrangement

of “Les Sylleplles,“ featuring Fon-
teyn and Nurcyev, was excellently
done. Once again the fantastic learn
of Fonteyn and Nureyev proved in-
comparable. Tllc slow, graceful
movements of Fonieyn were beau-
tifully executed. lier toe rises were
particularly masterful in this ss-
leciion.

Nureycv proved once again that
he is the master of the lnuslc. lie

floor to capture the applause of the
audience. It was indeed different to
watch an audience applaud a film of

“Le Corsaire," the third selec-
tion, was both the shortest and most
magnificent display by the Nureyev-
Fouleyn duo. Nureyev's Tartar blood
seemed to swell within him as the
music became lnore rapid and in-
tense. Necdless to say, he exeellcd

to say that he held the audience

Erich Fromm’s 'loving’. I

Challenges Every Man '

by Larry Epstein

“The Art of Loving," by Erich
Fromm, is a guidebook, in the psy-
chological sense, to a more satis-
fying way of life. Love requires
knowledge and effort; it is not
merely a series of pleasurable sen-
sations (being loved), but. also a
capacity to love.

Modern man has a muddled re-
laiionship with God. "Just asbroth-
erly love has been replaced by 
fairness, God has been transformed
into a remote General Director of
Universe, inc.; you know that he is
there... you follow his leadership
while you are ‘doing your part‘."

Solution Is Love
The solution is love. Nola Freu—
dian brand, where sexuality was the
basis of love, but rather a love in
which the partners shares the dif-
flcullles and joys of existence.

By the end of the book, Fromm
is ready to lay down ground rules.
The first important requisite is
discipline—not only ill the particular
art of loving, but also in one's ell-
tlre life.

Diffused and Unconccntrotcd

Concentration is the next condi-
tion. Contemporary culture, with-
out parallel, Ilas a way of life that
is diffused and unconcentrated. We
should be able to sit, doing abso-
lutely nothing - no talking, smok-
lllg, reading or drinking.

Third comes patience. “If one

is after quick results, one never
learns an art.” Modern industry
fosters "quickness."

Practise of Faith
Thus far the requisites for the
art. of loving could be applied to
any art. Specifically for the art of
loving are these: (i) the overcom-
ing of one’s narcissism, (2) the
practise of faith.

“Rational faith is not primarily
belief in something, but the quality
of certainty and firmness which our
convictions have. Faith is a char-
acter trait pervading the whole per-
sonality, rather than a specific be-
lief."

Courage and Activity
included in faith is courage and
(3) activity. "...by activity is not
meant ‘dolng something' but an inner
activity is the productive use of
one’s powers.

Honest Book
Fromm has written an honest
book about an undeniable problem.
He may be an optimist, but he
offers a personal and social ethic
that would very possibly lead to

greater understanding and enjoy- '

meni of the human situation.

On the other hand, Fromm is
too optimistic. Unfortunately for
the history of the human race there
are always people ready to take
advantage of men with universal
concern. Total commitment to life
is an act beyond the will or power
of far too many human beings.
