bany. Hence. 'it shall. This» week several meetings

 enthusiasm continues. . '

. The Albany State cross-country teams suffered set-
backs at thefeet of Holy Cross last Saturday, snapping
' the varSity’s skein at 20 and the fresh at five. Perhaps
this is the best time for the sports staff to publicly
commend Coach Munsey on his efforts.
No Disgrace ,

Holy Cross is a New England conference powerhouse,
and yet the Dane barriers were defeated by only 10
points. Bowing to a school of Holy Cross’s caliber is
‘certainly no disgrace. and we have a feeling'the State
runners will rebound tohave a fine season.

Coach Munsey has tremendous pride in his team, and
the way and degree in which he instills it in his run-
ners is unbelievable. and inspiring.

Another coach up for commendation is soccer mentor
Joe Garcia. Garcia’s boaters displayed superb sports-
manship in restraining from indulging in the dirty and
highly unsportsmanlike conduct of Montclair State. In
defeating Montclair, the Dane booters not only scored
a fine upset, but they gave the fans a working example
of what athletics is all about.

Fine Showing

The players showed exceptional poise (coming from
behind twice), extreme determination and unprecedented
sportsmanship. Coach Garcia has done an excellent job
in teaching the players the ideals he so values.

In AMIA football action, it looks as if it is now only
a two team race. Kappa Beta and APA each sport un-
defeated records and are four points ahead of their
nearest rivals. Defending champ Potter was virtually
eliminated by the Tower, and Trinity is not living up
to pre-season expectations.

The sports staff is anxiously awaiting the game be-
tween these two teams, slated for next week. We shall
give the game all the coverage it merits.

V
'lished by the “New York Times
Magazine” earlier this year.

In- ibe first of these articles
he asserts that the reason behind
campus protests is the students’
conviction that they are being
short-changed.

Main Factors

The main factors deterring an
improvement of our colleges are
the expanding student body and
bureaucracy. He states that the
majority of our college students
are seeking a degree'for financial
and social reasons.

Dr. Hacker says that the root
of the trouble lies in the tendency
to compare American colleges with
those of earlier generations, when
the classes were not so large and
anonymous.

He concludes that iargecoileges
are one of the consequences of a
democracy.
