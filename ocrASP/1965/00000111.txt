Absentee Ballots

',‘Those students over 21 who have ap-
plied for absentee ballots for this No-
vember’s election should be receiving
these ballots now. If you are over 21
and have not applied for your ballot,
do so now by writing to your local

provide an active example for the stu~
dents to follow. Many of the student
members are new to government. They
have.more reason to be reserved than
the faculty. When both the inexper-
ienced students and the faculty sitback,
the process of government falls to very
few students. This is wrong.

Perhaps the answer to the situation
is for President Thompson to try to
anticipate the topics of discussion and
arrange for particular motions to be
made when situations call for them.
Perhaps this will end the periods of
silence at the meetings of Central
Council.

(iced Signs

The difficulties of student govern-
ment are many. The ability to function
effectively is the goal of each member
of the government. This was clear at
last week’s meeting of the Central
Council.

President Richard Thompson is
handling his job with rare skill.

Student government is always plagued
by the presence of sincere people who
have no ability to understand govern-
ment procedures. While this problem
remains, most members of Central
Council seem to have some grasp of
government procedures.

'l‘hompson, by arriving at compro-
mises-before meetings, has been able
to keep meetings from bogging down
in questions of wording. The Council
also seems willing to take a recess
and battle things out informally when
a bind develops. ,

These signs -— the general absence
of people who do not understand gov—
ernment. Thompson’s own abilities.
and the use of the recess — indicates
that the Council will have a productive
year.

apportionment. ,

The importance of this election is
clear; so is the responsibility of each
person eligible to vote.

Faculty Reluctance

There are now faculty members in-
"volved in the workings of the Central
Council. Our firstimpressionsofthese
faculty members leads us to three con-
clusions. ‘

The faculty members are interested
in 'the government. They understand
boththe setup of the government and
problems facing the government. They
are generally unwilling to initiate
action.

We realize that the faculty are hesi-
tant and perhaps fearful of charges
that they are trying to dominate things.
We hope that the faculty members will
be more active than they have been so
far. if they begin to dominate the pro—
ceedings they will realize it and rec-
tify the situation themselves.

We would rather see the faculty

Consistency inciting
To theEditors: ' . -
in your issue of October 1, 1965,
we read n'note soytngthot you need
Writers. After having read the or-
ticlos about the University of Puer-
to Rico, published in the some is-
suo, we belieVe that you really do.

These articles stand out because
of their lack of consistency. Ob-
viously the authors failed in the
task of organizing the material of-
fectively and properly. This,
among other things, presents an
extremely ambiguous, incomplete
and confused picture of what the
University of Puerto Rico and its
students really are like. Since the
three girls who were interviewed
were concerned enough about the
articles to personally apologize to
our fellow Puerto Rican exchange
students, it is evidentthat the mis-
representation of our school could
not have been on their part.

The confusion is such that, on
many occasions, the universityiife
is wrongly identified with the life
of the Puerto Ricans. The best in-
stance of this is clearly illustrated
by the foliowingexcerpt:“The ma-
jor complaint was against the food
served in the cafeteria. The Puerto
Rican's diet is mostly beans, rice
Meat is seldom
served."

Evidently, the authors proceed,
in a mistaken induction, from the
food served in the cafeteria to be
Puerto Rican diet; as lithe univer-
sity affairs could be identified with
the real and essential life of a
whole country.

Yet, we agree that the food of the
cafeteria is not the best. In what
state university is the food good?
However, we would like to refute
the statement that "meatis seldom
served." As a matter of fact, the
Slater Company, an American food
service that is responsible for the
food served in the cafeteria, pro-
vides meat every day of the week.
If this meat is not the best, that
does not mean that it is excluded
from the diet almost wholly.

Another point that was exces-
sively pointed out, is the supposed
lack of "school spirit" in the stu-
dents of the Ui’ii. “...There is a
very little show of school spirit.”
The students “transfer” it “to
their highly select fraternities and
sororities” and “spend most of
their time at hotels and beaches."

What picture of a Ul’it student is
this? There is no mention of the
students’ cultural initiation, no
mention of the high quality oftheir
publications, no recognition of the
great number of them who gave
themselves to the task of intellec-
tual development. it presents the
University life as one almost
strictly social. The Ui’lt student
appears indifferent and almost 11'-
responsible toward his duties.

This picture is very much mis-
taken. As in every college, at tile
Ui’it soelai life is important; that
is also part of our character for-
mation. liut, contrary to what is
suggested by the articles, social

, LITTLE MAN

 

life' is not the most importont func-
tion of the unworsity of.Puerto
Rico; our cultural octivites out-
number the social ones. There is no
justification in applying the be-
havior of some groups to the whole
student body. At an institution of
20,000 students, a generalization
of this nature is very daring.

Urges Attendance

To the Editors:

On October 19, 1965, a lecture
by Professor Andrew Hacker,
"The Future of American Fed-
eralism,” will open the Univer-
sity’s symposium, “America at
Mid-Century."

Professor Hacker will be fol-
lowed by a series of distinguished
lecturers who will explore the
political, social, and intellectual
climate of the United States today.

This is the second year that the
Albany faculty has planned and
sponsored a lecture program of
this magnitude and depth. Last year
Dr. Edith 0. Wallace set the pre-
cedent when she headed a com-
mittee who‘ scheduled a series of
speakers and exhibitions in com-
memoration of the four hundredth
anniversary of the Renaissance.

Encouraged by the enthusiastic
reception of the initial symposium,
faculty members immediately
came forward to sponsor a second
one. They were joined in their ef-
forts by individuai students and
student organizations, some of
which had been included in the
preparations for the Renaissance
symposium.

The Commission for Academic
Affairs has been priviiedged to
play a small part in the student
contribution toward the success of
this symposium.

The Board for the College of
Arts and Sciences, Pi Gamma Mn,
and the Board for the school of
education have coordinated the
participation of the commission
area.

Frankly, from what we have ob-
served, we are impressed with
the potential meaningfulness ofthis
symposium for the entire Univer-
sity community. Its relevance has
been clearly evidence.

Therefore, at a meeting of the
connnlssion on October 0, 1965,
we unanimously determined to
demonstrate our support of the
symposium by attending in a body,
the lecture by Victor Persciietti,
on November 111, 1005.

We urge each member of the
student body to personally assure
the largest possible audience for
“America at Mid-Century."

.‘Intellectu‘al Agitation

"Berkley--the Issues.” and their implications for
Albany State, were explored by a student-
panel at the Golden Eye last Friday night.
panelists William Gross and Harold Lynne both

seemed to see the problem which led to the explo-
sions at Berkley as essentially a conﬂict between

the expectations of students for a liberal education 

and the pressures and demands of society.

Lynne pointed to the
"military industrial
complex” which is pres-
suring unlvers.’ ties to
train students in certain
ways.

Gross cited the demands of the
Berkley community that students
not be allowed to initiate political
demonstrations.

Dr.- Ciifton C. Thorne, vice pres-
ident of student affairs, began his
View with an analysis of the Berk-

the Council.

L General Business
The Constitutions of two com-

missmns were passed _ those of it with Albany. He cited Berkley’s

Communications Commission, and
Community Programming Com-
mission.

Three committees were formed-
a committee to study chaperoning
procedures, one to investigate the
necessity of salaried positions for
Student Association offices, and
an Ad Hoc committee to investi-
gate and formulate financial pol-
icy.

The Who's Who coma ittee will
meet on Monday, October 18, to
prepare its list of nominations.
Central Council will meet to con-
sider this list on October 19.
Elections for Who’s Who will be
held on Wednesday and Thursday,
October 20 and 21. The completed
list of the candidates will then be
sent to the national headquarters.

The policy for the treatment of
political action groups, and their
activities was approved by the
Council. The groups may form and
operate as they see fit, and must
comply with University regulations
concerning naming. (This is based
on the controversy created by
SCOPE last year.)

Newsbourd Elects Members,

Accepts Two

Klaus Sclmitzer and Gary Woods
were elected to Newsboard posi-
tions on the ASIJ at the first meet-
ing of Newsboard, Thursday, Octe-
her 7.

Schnitzer was elected Photo-
graphy Editor. lie replaces Doug-

las Upham who had been Photo- .
graphy Editor since first semes- '

tor of the 1903-64 school year.
Schniizer has been on Newsboard
as Associate Photography Editor
since January, 1964.

Woods was elected to fill the
position vacated by Sclmitzei‘. lie

has worked with photography on U

the paper for over a year.
The meeting also saw the resig-
nation of Judy Conger from her

position of Technical Supervisor. .

She had served in this capacity for
two and one-half years. Her posi-
tion remains unfilled.

In accepting Upham's resigna-

 

ley student body. He noted its size
(28,000 students), great range of
academic ability, and “wide var-
iety of attitudes and orientations.”

"Berkley is not an academic
community, it can't be," he said.
"This may well have something to
say about the quality of the aca-
demic relationship between the
student and faculty member."

No Chance More

Dr. Morris Berger, 3 member
of the education department fac-
ulty, disagreed. "One of the major
dangers of an intellectual com-
munity is the danger of rebellion.
The major reason we won't have
a rebellion here is because we
don't have an intellection commun-
ity.”

Berger did post-graduate stud-
ies at Berkley, and he compared

excellent bookstores, always-open
coffee houses, and large number
of graduates, "free souls," and
educational hangers-on who “keep
the professors worried" as major
r: axons why Berkley is in fact an
intellectual community.

At Albany he sees little of this
intellectual ferment, although he
pointed to the International Film
Group, "suppression," and the
new political action groups as
encouraging signs.

Student Policy-Makers

The question of student parti-
cipation in University policy de-
cisions brought diverse sugges-
tions. Gross suggested that stu-
dents have no voice on matters of
educational policy, but that they
be allowed to run the dormitories,
hiring their own counselors and
arranging for their own food serv-
ice.
Dr. Thorne felt that “faculty
must still be the guardians ofaca-
demic disciplines, but studentpar-
tlcipation should be takenintocon-
slderation.”

Resignation:

lIIFllIEIIZA VACCINE

The following announcement has been released from the Univer-
sity Health Service

"Due to the fact that influenza vaccine is in short supply and
probably will not be available until the first week in November, a
limited program is being undertaken which will provide for all
residence directors and residence assistants who would be key
personnel in case of an epidemic.

"Students who know their records here indicate the presence of a
significant health problem such as heart trouble, rheumatic fever,
diabetes, kidney disease, etc. should also obtain the vaccine. Preg-
nancy is another indication of need for the vaccine.

“Vaccine will be given in the Medical Office, Draper 011, on dates
to be announced as soon as the vaccine arrives. It will probably cost
less than fifty cents for each injection.

“The series is one injection followed by a second in one month.
individuals not obtaining the vacgine in this program are urged to
check with their private physician for a first injection at Thanks-
giving followed by a second injection at Christmas time.

"it is impossible to predict with certainty, but influenza in this
area usually comes late in winter or early spring according to
Public Health records.

“Faculty and staff who feel they want or need inﬂuenza vaccine
should check with their private physicians.

“The dates and times when the shots will be administered will
be announced as soon as the material arrives."

In exclusive” interv
WSUA's Sunday current". affairs

. program, "Comment," ,Dr. Edith
‘ Cobano and Mr. Morliniinthoway

discussed the problems of physi-
cal education It Albany State. _. '

Mr. Hathaway felt the problems
are due to the lock of facilities.
As he said, "We have atwo your

physical education requirement;

but facilities limit this to only
one year of instruction.” . _ ,

Both Mr. Hathaway and Dr. Co-
bane expressed a need for indi-
vidual instruction and evaluation
as well as the development 'of a
proper image of one's own phy'si-
cal abilities.‘

Dr. Cobane felt the program
should try to develop, "abilities
which may be used for each 'wo-
man's recreation as well as for
the recreation of her future mm-
ily." She also felt it is a preva-
lent misconception here at State
that exercise creates an unattrac-
tive muscle bound woman. ,

Dr. Cobane summed up thegonl
of the physical education depart-
ment by saying, “We are trying
to develop individuals who per-
ceive movement as a means to
learning other things."

Mr. Hathaway said, "Our first
obligation is to the undergrad-
uate." However, he hopes toeven-
tuaily see a physical education
major and graduate school develop
here.

Both Dr. Corbane and Mr. Hath-
away feei that many of the prob-
lems will be solved when the new
campus facilities are completed.
