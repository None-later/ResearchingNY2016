Over APA

In what has to be one

of the most exciting AMIA

football games ever played at State. Kappa Beta, on
the passing of Dan Thomas and the catching of Kirk
Ellis, defeated Alpha Pi Alpha. 25—7. to virtually

wrap up its first AMIA

championship. Both teams

had entered the game undefeated. with KB’s goal line
yet to be penetrated in five previous games.

But that didn’t last for

long, as on the third play
of the game. Don Prockup
hit Steve Zahurk with a
spectacular 58 yard
touchdown pass. Prockup
then passed to Mike Gil-
martin for the extra point.

That was all the scoring APA
could muster, as the rest of the
game was KB’s. in the second
quarter, Rick Pierce intercepted
a Prookup pass at the APA 2".
Twu plays later, Thomas hit Ellis
with a 15 yard pass for a TD. KB
missed the extra poiiii and APA
still led, 7-13.

A few minutes later, APA had

plays later, Thomas found Ellis

by a speciactular 40 yard run by

John Gleason, and Don Woodrufl,
for stopping the high-poweredAPA

Experts Analyze Issues

Of National Debate Topic ‘

On Friday, O‘ctOber 15, members of the Debate
Council traveled to Utica College to attend a work-

shop on the national topic

. This year’s topic involves

the granting of greater freedom to law enforcement
agencies in detecting and prosecuting crime. Major
issues are “electronic eavesdropping,” self-incrim-

ination, “the third de-
degree,” search and sei-
zure policies, and civil

. , \
liberties.

The general purpose of the work-
shop was to provide experts in all
these fields to provide information
on these topics, and answer ques-
tions of the debaters. The workshop
brought the issues to a personal
basis, which would intensin the
debater’s interest in his topic.

On Saturday, Mr. AryehNeier,
representative of the Civil Lib-
erties Union of New York, gave the
opinions of this agency. Individual
liberties guaranteed by the Con-
stitution, are violated by such
things as wire-tapping, and the
third degree.

Viewpoints of the police force
were presented by Mr. Joseph
Piccola, prominent law enforce-
ment officer froth the Utlca area.
He stated that the third degree is
not a practice of the police. Wire-
tapping and greater use of search
warrants would help a great deal,
and would not be that great an
invasion of privacy when consid-
ering the fact that crltne is an
insult to society.

These three men also particl-
pated in a panel discussion and
informal debate on the topic. At
that time, students were allowed
to ask questions.

On Friday eveiiiitg (October 22),
two members of the Cambridge

A lawyer. educator and professor of social science at Harvard since 1958,

pected as a matter of course, as
it is today. He stressed, however,
the extreme importance of educa-
tion to the earlier generation.

Role of College

He states that, since college is
so much a matter of course today,
the students have become ex-
tremely blase in their attitudes
concerning it. They are, first and
foremost, bodies — in athletics,
food, sex and comfort.Mind enters
somewhat later.

The college women of today are
caught in the wave of decision the
older "colonial" views of their
roles, or the new superior role
that seems to be showing itself
these days.

Riesman says that there is a
lot to be said for both sides that
career-marriage-minded women
do not necessarily have to wan
the upper hand. ‘

Series Continues

The future speakers in the sym-
posium include James Q. Wilson,
director of the joining center for,
