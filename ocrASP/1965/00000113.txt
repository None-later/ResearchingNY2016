There are two primary justiit-
cations ior the system at Feder-
alism: that the states exist as
experimental laboratories in which
laws can be tested and that the
states should he allowed to make
its own laws since certain situa-
tions are difierent in the states,
thereiore a federal law would be

impractical.
Rejects Both

Hacker rejected both of these

justiﬁcations, saying that the num-

ber oi cases oi those states that
really experiment productively is
negligible andthatthebest example
oi tlwse states which have laws

selves is Mississippi which re-

Hacker's concluding statement

is probably the best summation oi

his lecture: There is no mture to
American Federalism.

Hacker spoke in Page Hall last
Tuesday night to large and recep-
tive audience. His thoughts andhis
disarming manner of speech
evoked favorable reactions from
most oi the people at the lecture.
