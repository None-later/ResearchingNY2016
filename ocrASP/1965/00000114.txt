Ba e_i c Set

The basic underpinnings of the

different levels, some of which
are raked, covered in rough bur-
lap. The unlocaliasd nature of the
set solves one of the major pro-
duction problems: how to present
four separate scenes on a stage
as limited as Page.

it is a problem Donneiiy has
solved admirably with the use of
a sky cyclorama, two movable
wooden platforms mounted on slid-
ing frames, and some "bul-
rushes",

Several Purposes

The platforms, uniocaiized as
they are, not only lend themselves
to beingdressed as different areas,
but also, bedause of their varying

' heights, serve as boundaries for

, .‘scenes played in smaller areas.

I For example, the first and final
scenes take place in a glad near a

used as a playing area. Banks, in
table, and chairs replaces the
rashes, and, instead of a sky
cyclorama, a ceiling-beam piece
appears overhead.

Designed to give a broken-down
atmoaphere to the bunkhouse, it
is suspended, or "flown" from
wires backstage, and can be
lowered or raised to meet the
scene requirements.

Launto & Loft

Two shorter scenes are played
on a partial stage, one at each
side. A crude wooden framework
set on a sliding platform appears
in a pool of light at stage right
and is used for the scene of Len-
nie’s visit to Crooks' lean-to.

The same technique is used to
convert the down-stage left area
into a barn left. A gate-like ap-
paratus, on casters, provides the
backdrop against which Lennie and
Curley's wife enact the doom of
both.

Adoption to Set

molecules with the set have
been few and have usually hinged
around theolow progress of adapt-
ing to the angle of (rake of the
three main platforms.

Early rehearsals were con-
ducted on a floor marked out in

areas, but obviously of one level
only. Once on the platforms, sev-
eral scenes required alteration,
notably a fight which takes place
in the bunkhouse.

 

.‘LD h“-
 a

The nature of the set, with a
considerable amount left to the
audience's imagination, makes it
possible for the actors to play
more fully unhampered by speci-
ftcs.

Designed to underscore the
play's sculptural values, it also
emphasizes the universality of the

play’s theme through its own sim-
Diicity.

Migrants

Couchod in the rhythmical, il—
baid and raucous speech of Hit“
ranch hand, the story i‘o\'ol\t-~»
around Lonnie and George, who
forever travel the path of tho mi-

scene, the play is more than a story
of these ten people at this specific
lime.

Rather, it Is the story ofevery
individual who seeks his place in
the universe. it is marked by a
strong sense of the juxtaposition
of tragic and comic, good and evil,
played against the background of
the external enigma of man’s iii-
tontions and the results.

Method Acting

Assisted by Christine Smith,
Leonard has set a rigorious pace
since rehearsals began Sept. 2’7.
Certain of Stanislavski's methods
- among thorn the "if" principle
whereby an actor imagines himself

have been applied.

Another iiigiiiy successful device
has been improvisation, where the
nctors were forced to carry on the
action of the scene at hand without
benefit of scripts or memorized
lines -— a practice which leads to
ll degree of truth, immediacy, and
directness perhaps unsurpassed
i-ven by the script itself.

challenge. Handled, like the con-
sll'uction of the set, mainly by an
all-girl stagecraft class, details
of makeup, costumlng, props and
lighting are being coordinated un-
der both Donnein and Leonard.

Lighting, as vet in the planning
stages pending completion of all
other phases, will have the task
of creating the atmosphere of four
separate locales, indoors as well
as out.

Wardrobe mistress Sue Raynor,
another new addition to the theatre
staff, has competently handled the
myriad questions connected with
costmniiig. The question of what
to put on the actors was more
complex than might be supposed.

Problems

It was agreed that Leiinle should
wear overalls — but should they
have a bib or suspenders? Plaid
shirts were a possibility for the
ranch hands — but what colors?
Once decided upon, the costumes
had to be located — and no fewer
than three trips to rummage sales,
to find clothes of the necessary
age, were the result.

Although the play has few char .

acter parts requiring costume
changes in the actors’ appear-
ances, some sort of makeup is
essential to prevent “washout”

of features under the bright lights.
Straight Make-Up

The majority of the make-up is
straight — that is, designed to
emphasize, rather than change,
the facial features.

Some characters, however, no-
tably Candy, require makeup to
create the appearance of full old
age, and several sessions have
been entirely given over to the
intricacies of the art.

A great deal of the action in
“Of Mice and Men" hinges on the
use of stage properties,the search
for which has at times approxi-

mated a scavenger hunt. A dead
mouse, army blankets, and gen-
uine firearms were but a few of
the more challenging props.

flow the prop committee solved
the probicin of having two live
dogs on stage, however, has be-
come something of a professional
secret, to be revealed only on
opening night.
