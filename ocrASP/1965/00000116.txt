The city has offered to move the University’s

Action by the city's legislative body, Common
Council, and the stage legislature will be required

The audit said that the three
faculty student associations in-
Vestigaied were incorporated as
non-profit entities with the top

the board of directors, but none
of the three examined, had stu-
dent representation.

The auditors emphasized that
the rapid growth of the State Un-
iversities had thrown the entire
pricing structure out of shape.
The gross income at this Uni-
versity was $697,072 with a net
profit of $146.704.

Book stores were the biggest
profitmakers. The bookstores at
Buffalo and Albany sold their text-
books at list price and at New

Erastus Corning to “use his good offices to get the ‘ " "

The 27-acl'e site, which is located on Washington

The auditors also criticized the

Albany's association was criti-
cized for beinglax.They attributed
this to poor purchasing practices.
They said that the faculty student
association paid $39,885 against a
state price of $31,727.

Administration Rebuttal

The Administration said that
the auditors neglected to noie that

that in watching over the affairs

student associations used lax pro-

The topic will be “Tile Philo-
soplly of Ayn Rand." Miss Rand is
well-known for her novels “Atlas
Shrugged” and "The Fountain-
head” and is considered the
founder of a philosophy known as
Objectivlsm.

The, panel will include two fac-
'ulty members and two students.
Dr. Mark Berger, the Philosophy-
Education Departments; Mr. Wil-
liam Grimes, Philosophy Depart-

columnist and commentator for
WSUA; Lester Greenberg, editor
of Banner.

The Objectivisi philosophy is
based on what Miss Rand calls
“rational self-interest." Called

. "Fascist" by many of her early

readers who did notunderstand the
philosophy, she is radically op-
posed to Socialism in government.

After the publication of her first

’ major novel “Tile Fountainhead”
‘ln 1943, Objectivism became one

of the most controversial philo-
sophies of the post-war period.
To meet the interest in her idea,
Miss Rand helped organize the
Nathaniel Branden Lectures in ma-
jor American cities and the Ob-
jectivisi Newsletter.
