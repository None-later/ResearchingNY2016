Union. spoke in B‘rubacher Private Dining Room on

‘Wednesday. October 28 at

discussion was John Lindsay, the Republican-Lib- ‘

8:00 p.m. The topic of his

era! candidate for Mayor of New York City. ..

“Button told of the way
in which he met Lindsay
and of the way in which
his book came to be .pub—
lished. His next point of
discussion was on the
technical aspects of the
book, » practically chap-
ter by chapter.

Lindsay’s public image was de-
fended by Button, to such an ex-
tent that the only other person
who could have done a better job
would have been Lindsay himself.

Campaign Manager

Button also discussed at length
Robert Price, Lindsay’s campaign
manager. This Was the same man
who swung the Oregon primary
for Nelson A. Rockefeller in the
summer of 1964. Button had al-
most as much praise for Price
as he had for Lindsay.

John V. Lindsay is the Repub-
lican Representative from the 17th
district of New York State.ln 1964,
Lindsay carried this district by
80,000 votes, while President
Johnson carried it by 75,000.

His record in Congress shows
Lindsay voted for most of the

Dr. Audrey Kouvel, professor of
Romance languages and literatures
and comparative literature at the
University, delivered the second in
a series of lectures commemor-
ating the Dante anniversary, yes-
terday in Brubacher Hall.

ysis of the Paolo and Francesca

ciety of America and Emeritus

Lindsay's Poslrlons

Fiscally, Lindsay isaconserva-
tfve. However, he has favored
civil rights legislation, studies on
urban problems with an emphasis
on the housing problems. Con-
cerning the Viet Nam crisis Lind-
say would like to have a national
debate for Lindsay questions the
exactness of Johnson’s policy in
South East Asia. ‘

Using this method of campaign-
ing he could cayer a large apart-
ment building in fifteen minutes.
The last few minutes of the 'dis-
cussion were devoted to Button’s
personal comments on Lindsay.

Odds Against Lindsay

He told of the mathematical
odds which Lindsay must over-

come,
three Democrats to every one
Republican. Button noted that

among the Republicans there is a
feeling of “professional pessi-
mism” while among Lindsay’s
personal followers there is an
"upbeat optimism."

Button feels that Lindsay will
be able to carry New York City.

Mr. Ra‘sman pointed out that. The greatest enemy of the now

victorious academic is the col-
,h legiate. This includes sororities,
fraternities, or the “ fun and games
culture” as Mr. Reisman pointed
-out. Although at present the aca-

potential of offering competition

Questions? ,
During the question period which
followed, Mr. Heisman was asked
for a frank evaluation ofwhfch type
of climate seemed to prevail at
our own SUNYA.

Mr. Reisman showed clearly that
he had taken the time and energy
to acquaint himself with repre-
sentative communication organi-
zations such as "Primer," the
“ASP”. and the "Torch." SUNYA,
as a university college was eval-
uated as being tops by Mr. Reis-
man.

We have the elements of the
academic, non and anti-academic
in healthy and valuable interaction.
Mr. Relsman considered the con-
troversial statement of last year's
"Torch" that we were a university
“on the make" as very apt.

 

politics culturally ‘ ‘ men ‘
are admired and demanded as an
integral part of their organiza-

Mr. Reisman cited the growthof
right wing groups on campuses as
another example of academic in-
filtration. Students attempt to

  
    
   
   
    

backgrounds throught these right
wing groups, but in the final anal-
ysis, retain their old philosophies.
