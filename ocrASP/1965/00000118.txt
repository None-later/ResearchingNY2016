by George Nagy
Editors Natal The following story,
commemorating the anniversary 0
the Hungarian revolution, is writ-
ten by a' Hungarian refugee who
gives aﬂrat hand account 'of the
revolution. ‘

There are moments of grinding
pain and unspeakable happiness in
a man's life that he remembers

, with the vividness of the actual

experience throughout many years.
The thought of the 1956 unparalled
freedom flight of the Hungarian
people brings such vivid and im-
mortal memories to my mind.

I remember the first seconds of
freedom when my parents and some
of the neighbors were standing in
our room listening to the sounds
of the Anthem which has so long
been misused by traitors and for-
eign occupants. The tears in our
eyes were proof that atremendous
wave of emotions overcame us.

National Pride
We knew: “Hungary was ready
(0 die standing rather than live
kneeling.” The speeches made at

   

large mass demonstrations radi-
ated‘ national "pride and free-
hearted enthusiasm. The red-
white-green colored Hungarian
flags flew over every building in
Budapest and over the Parliament
with hope never before promised
to the Hungarian people.

The citylwas upheld by true
patriots. Behind the guns stood
factory workers, draftsmen, and
students. Their faces were tired,
but their goals were healthy and
honest, free oi Nazism and anti-
semitism. Yet, the time of victory
and glory lasted only eleven days.

The Russian invasion that fol-
lowed on the 5th ofNovember 1958,
decreased our hopes hour by hour.
The embittered fighting caused
both sides heavy casualties. The
Red Army lost five tanks, two
trucks and about 200 men in a
matter of minutes two hundred
yards from my house where we
built barricades to stop the tanks.

in the next moment the Russians
destroyed four apartment houses
and a movie house from where
they thought the sniper fire came.

I Building Better Bridge

by Hony‘Nuchols

The first tournament of this
semester was held on Oct. 10.
Two newcomers to State, Marty
Bergen and Al Tepperberg, were
the winners, with Betty Van Wick-
len and Brook Wolkoff placing
second.

The hand» which appears this
week is one the winners played
against this writer and his part-
ner. Bergen is sitting South. The
opening bid is characteristic of
third hand openings at duplicate
bridge.

South’s overcsll was routine.
North’s jump raise is excellent,
promising near an opening bid and
good support. South naturally con-
tinued to game.

This writer, sitting West, opened
the nine of spades, and a slnall
card was played from the dummy,
allowing East to make his king.
The spade return was won in the
South hand and a low trump was
won in the dummy with the king,
felling East's queen.

The spade ace provided a park-
ing place for South’s losing dia-
mond. The South hand was re-
entered with the diamond ace.
South now led a low club, a wise
decision, If he had drawn three
round of trump at this point, good
defense would have defeated the
contract.

\Vest discarded a spade (it does

no good to trump), and the dummy
won the ace of clubs. The club ten
was led from dummy, covered with
the jack and king and trumped in
the West hand.

The diamond return was ruffed
in the South hand, and South then
drew trumps and conceded a club
to East. One more top for the win-
ners. And yes, sharples, a dis-
mond lead defeats the contract.

For the tournament as a whole,
the turnout was disappointing. No
faculty members were there and
fewer students than expected par-
ticipated. The next game will be
Oct. 31. Hopefully, more players
will be there to challenge the
champs.

Chess corner J

by Bob Merritt

The queen is the strength and
might of the chess arsenal and
as such should be used with cau-
tion. Beginners, especially, al-
lured by her power, are in great
haste to develop the queen In the
opening moves.

This practice ls fundamentally
erroneous and frequently lethal.
As a general rule, propitious np-
portunitles for the queen arise
between the eighth and fifteenth
moves, and then oftentimes to
anchor a strategic piece.

The best way to profit 1! your
opponent develops an "early"
quecn is immediate harassment.
The knight serves this purpose
excellently. Developing your
pieces while simultaneously forc-
ing the queen to move gives you an
overwhelming tempo.

Russian casualties which have
never been officially announced,
have been estimated to exceed
15,000 men. Official reports indi-
cate that 32,000 Hungarians died
in the fighting, but the actual num-
ber is probably much higher.

Destruction in Budapest was
everywhere. The cith had not wit-
nessed such torture since the'end
of World War 1!. Two hundred
thousand persons, 2% of the popu-
lation escaped to the West through

invasion.

The Russians sent their wildest
and most uninformed soldiers to
Budapest. Some of them thought
they “were in Egypt and looked for
crocodiles in the Danube; others
were told ‘they had to fight against
German Nazis.

Russia!" Trade Side!

A number of Russians fed up
with Communism, took up the Hun-
garian flag and turned againsttheir
fellow countrymen. Even in a few
isolated .areas the Reds traded
their vehicles for bread and other
kinds of food, because their supply
lines had been out by small revo-
lutionary groups.

It is difficult to describe the
exasperation that ruled our actions
in the months of terror that fol-
lowed the uprising. Ten million
people, the whole population, was
on strike for about four months.
The schools reopened in February
1957, but even then scattered
shooting was reported in some
areas of the capitol.

While people cried joy on Octo-

tears a month later realizing that
all the blood, sacrifice, and suf-

fering was in vain. Yet, 1956 gave p

me something valuable to learn. I

Farmhouse

Dippikill has seen many
improvements since it
was first purchased by
Student Association in
January, 1956. Most of
these have been connected
with the farmhouse on
the property.

When first acquired, the farm-
house had only a kitchen, dining
room, and three upstairs bed-
rooms. \Vork parties of students
added a large, uninsulated living
room with a fireplace and an
equipment building.

additions have been bunk-beds,
