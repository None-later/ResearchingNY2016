Concert
Ian and Sylvia are well known
among folk music lovers through
their appearances on Hootenanny
and the Bell Telephone Hour. Their
repertoire includes English and

American ' classic ball ads, moun-

days, is a favorite at supper clubs

as “clearly designed to make a stir.” He ex-
plained that state auditors had frequently looked at
the FSA books in the past. and that these investi-
gations had proved to be helpful.

However, he said,
“This was an audit of a
different kind. On this oc-
casion the intention was
not to help us, but to find
things that looked bad.”

He implied that some of the mo-

tivation behind the report was po-
litical, and cited the releasing of

The report also criticized that

we observed that the FSA’s paid
more for food than is paid by the
State under State contracts.” Dr.
Collins acknowledged this as true,

State University officials did
not receive the report until late

The third program of
the current symposium,
“America at Mid-Cen—
tury," will be held Mon-
day, November 8, inPage
Hall.

Dr. James Q. Wilson will speak
on “The Metropolis iu Transl-
tion." Dr. Wilson is Associate
Professor of Government at Har-
vard University and Director ofthe
Joint Center for Urban Studies of

nology and Harvard University.

Danileld, of "City Politics." He
has also written numerous arti-
cles for professional and schol-
arly journals.

In “Negro Politics," Dr. Wilson
writes that the problems of the
Negro will not be solved by grant-
ing him even the fullest civil
rights. For, he continues, it is
Negro's fundamental social and

one. Dr. Wilson asserts that Ne-
groes are making more gains in
areas where they are a minority,
rattler than in the Black Beltcoun-
ies.

In the Black Belt areas, police
abuse and administrative discrim-
ination have ceased. llowever, in
areas where Negroes are In the
minority, they have gained inte-
gration turd public worksprograms
to improve Negrolivlng conditions.

This, Dr. Wilson says, Is be-
cause of a well-organized white
political structure with which bar-
gains can be struck, and a large
and self-sufficient Negro leader-
ship class. These conditions make
it easier to translate votes into
substantive gains.

ln summarizing, Dr. Wilson
writes that Negro politics will ac-
complish only limited objectives,
due to the structure of American
politics and the nature ofthe Negro
community. This does not mean
that the Negro will be content with
lhnited accomplishments.

Dr. Wilson concludes by raising I
