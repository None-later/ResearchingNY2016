Tommy Dorsey Orchestra
To Give Concert at RPI

The Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra
will perform at the RP! Field House
Friday, November 12 at 8:30 p.m.
concert will feature Lee
Castle, “Prince of the Trumpet"
and musical conductor of the group.

In the early thirties, Jimmy Dor-
sey and his brother, Tommy Dor-
sey, won nationwide acclaim with
the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra.
Then Jimmy struck out on his
own and the result was an orches-
tra that ranked as one of the
greatest during the dance band era
of the late 1930's and the early
1940’s.

The Dorsey brothers split up in
1936, each with the idea of build-
ing an orchestra around his own
conception of music. For nearly
seventeen years the Dorsey broth-
ers carried on a friendly feud which
ended at the Hollywood Palladium
where Jimmy was playing an en-
gagement and Tommy was the next
attraction.

Both bands performed together
on stage and drew tremendous ap-
plause. Thereafter, they decided
to pool their resources and form

the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra with
Castle as the musical conductor.

Beverly Wright will also per-
form with the or'chestra. Wright is
an actress, song writer and gui-
tarist.

Tickets for the concert can be
purchased at the Field House and
reservations can be made by call-
lng Ashley 4-0900.

University f to

The Henry Hudson Planetarium
in Albany moved a step nearer to
reality today with the announce-
ment that the State University at
Albany has ordered a projector
to be installed at its new campus
site and appointed a director.

A recent agreement between the
State University Trustees and the
Albany County Hudsonthamplain
Committee, under which the com-
mittee would present over $50,000
raised during the 1959 Year of
History to the“ State, has permitted
the State to shelve plans for a
smaller planetarium which would
have served instructional purposes
primarily.

The Albany University now plans
to operate a larger unit which will
serve curriculum needs as well
as beng available to area school
children and the public onasched-
uled basis.

Permanent Memorial

The planetarium project is an
outgrowth of a movement to de-
velop such a facility in Albany
as a permanent memorial during
the Year of History. At the time
He Albany County Hudson-Cham-
Plain Committee raised funds to
support the establishment of a
planetarium, to be named for Hen-
ry Hudson, which would be located
on the grounds of the Dudley Ob-
servatory. When the Observatory's
plans were changed because of the
Albany Medical Center’s interest
in their property the planetarium
project was postponed.

7 The Committee's fund, repre-
senting gifts and pledges made in
l959 during the 2501b anniversary

of Hudson’s arrival in Albany,wasv

raised by a cﬁmmittee under James
A. Stiles, chairman. Once the
planetarium is opened it is ex-
pected to be the only permanent
memorial resulting from the
State's 1959 Year of History.

The idea for a planetarium was
bratlon committee under David H.
Beetle, chairman, and Joseerzzi,
vice chairman.

, Plans Underway
While specific building plans for
the planetarium are not complete
plans for its use are well underway

according to Professor Harry E.‘

Crull, who recently joined the Uni-
versity staff as planetarium direc-
tor. The building will be located
on the new campus and is expected
to seat approximately 300 under a
65 foot dome.

The program being planned for
the planetarium calls for instruc-
tion in astronomy for university
students, program opportunities
for area school children and public
viewing on a limited basis. The

Control Over Finances

The report also suggested that
the FSAs take more control over
student finances. Dr. Collins ex-
plained that this would be in direct
contradiction to the established
policy of the Albany Faculty-Stu-
dent Association.

He read the motion to this effect

which was made and passed in an
FSA meeting on September 20,
1950. The motion states: “This
corporation has no intention of
assuming any control, expressed
or implied, over the student asso-
ciation, and this corporation re-
affirms that the principle of corn-
plete autonomy of the student as-
sociallon.”

The FSA position toward student
funds is thus that student associa-
tion vouchers, properly made out
and signed, will be honored without
question.

Positive Aspects
Dr. Collins did cite severalpos-
itlve aspects of the report. It will
