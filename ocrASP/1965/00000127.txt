Why Student lax?

Thexdisclosure that student tax is a voluntary fee,
can have devastating ramifications on the workings
of Student Association; all activities on campus
might be forced to cease.

This is because student tax is the lifeblood of
campfis activities; without it there can be no news-
paper, no yearbook, no Pete Seeger, no Bayard
Rustin. no Directory, no Campus Viewpoint, no
plays, no special events such as Parents Weekend,
and Homecoming Weekend.

This does not have to happen if Student Associa-
tion gets full student support. Student support is
going to mean more than moral support or interest
in Student Association activities.

It means that every student voluntarily pays his
tax assessment each semester. -

Some people will probably feel that this assess-
‘ment is worthless. But when they examine the bene-
fits they derive from the tax, they cannot help but
realize what a tremendous return they get on their
investment.

A University cannot exist without these activities.
Its .intellectual and social life will be nil and its
students ivory-towered bunglers.

Therefore, we wholeheartedly support the present
student tax and encourage every student to pay this
all important assessment.

Also, we urge all students to support Richard
Thompson, president of Central Council, and the
efforts he will make to work out a solution to this
problem which effects this University and the fifty-
six other units in the state university system.

Editorial Cgmplamt

As Ican not hope to read your
mind, I have no way of knowing
your purpose in writing an edi-
torial. If your purpose is to be
inciteful (sic) then you succeed
many' times and I commend your
success.

Frequently you succeed in in-
citingme because of the obscurity
'of some ofcyour statements. If,
however, you are attempting to
cogently express a view with the
aim of convincing others of its
validity I, with reservations, have
to feel that you are often less than

' effective. '

This is brought out most re-
cently in your editorial of Novem-
ber 2, 1965 concerning FSA prac-
tices and in the opinions expressed
on two occasions concerning the
mascot question.

The FSA editorial seems to be
based upon implied facts and sta-
tistics which are never referred
to expliclty. The questions this
editorial raises in my mind could
partially be listed as follows:

1. What facts show that student
help is more expensive than full
time help?

2. Are resident room and board
bills increased by the expense of

»'student~?<‘em'ployers or is the ex-
pense absorbed? Is the effect only
on a decreased profit margin?

3. Would scholarships that are
available aid the broad academic
base which is helped by the dor-
mitory jobs? .

4. Why does Financial Aldshave
unfilled jobs? What are thesejobs?
Is the lack in student interest or
some of these jobs more a hard-
ship than a help?

5. Can you show that the jobs
held presently aren’t “desperately
needed?” If dormitory jobs and
Bookstore jobs were eliminated,
what would happen to the student
job demand? ,

6. What effect does the Book-
store profit have on the student?
15 he somehow deprived if the
profit is small? The state is con-
cerned about large Bookstore prof-
its in the State University system,
how does this reﬂect upon our
Bookstore and its policies?

7. Is the time involved in Dor-
mttory jobs enough to constitute
a full time job?

An editorial, by its nature, is

.mainly an expression of opinion.
But if these are issues you wish
the student body to become aware
of, you must give the student body
more information.

An editorial of opinion without
having the facts presented else-
where is not effective. A study
which brings out the facts on which
you base your view would be re-
sponsible reporting and could be
converted into a feature series of
real student interest.

IMUNICATIONS

The heading of the insert lll
which you list your staff states
that the ASP is published “by the
student body of the State Univer-
sity of New York at, Albany.’f

Yet, the editorial by the Sports
editor and the one of November 2,
1965 indicate in no way the gen-
eral student feeling on the mascot
question. This is also an unan-
swered question. .

If the ASP is published by the
student body, do you have a re-
sponsibility to discover what the
student body feels on this matter?

If the student body agrees with,
the ASP, then you could perform a“
service to the mascot committee.
by polling this interest and re-
porting it. As these editorials stand
they can be taken as only the pri-
vate opinion of two or three indi-
viduals, evidence to the contrary
lacking, and so lose the force they
would have If they were shown’to
be expressions of more widespread
feeling, if not in the editorial then
elsewhere.

With the hope that lhave not
sounded sarcastic.

Resents Letter

To the Editor:

As an avid Republican, and a
member of YAF, I resent Kath-
leen Earle's remarks in Novem-
ber 2nd issue of the ASP. Miss
Earle, feeling hurt by Ray Mc-
Cloat’s critical remarks concern-
ing the Great Danes as our mas-
cot, felt she should“do unto others
as they did unto her.”

However, she got carried away
by this. Not only does she call the
Republicans and YAF retrogres-
sive, but she also insulted Catholi-
cism.

Even 'to a non-Catholic this
seems entirely unnecessary. Just
what any of these three subjects
has to do with the controversy as
to whether a Great Dane or a
Penguin should be our mascot, Is
beyond me.

1 think that Miss Earle, in the
fervor of her defense, forgot what
she was discussing and “inad-
vertently” Inclosed some obvious
political and religious biases.

In a legitimate defense of her
position, this is not necessary.

Should this controversy remain
undecided, I would like to suggest
that Ray McCloat formulate ano-
ther opinion poll to determine
feelings of the student body.

Cnttctsm Unwarranted
To the Editor:

In your editorial entitled " F.S.A.
Practices,” you severely criti-
cized the Food Service policy of
employing student help and by so
doing increasing the expenses of
our Student-Faculty Assoc.

i find this criticism entirely
unwarranted and indeed evenonthe
verge of being ludicrous. ,_

Let me explain. Your maih‘point
appears to be that the employment
of full-time student help would
result in a great savings ofmoney.

You may say that this “is clear
to everyone." Well, it is not clear
to me. You infer that thesekitchen
positions are akin to scholarships.
They are not. Student helpers are
being paid for services rendered
and i might add, necessary serv-
ices. '

Furthermore thesejobs are open
to any student desiring the posi-
tion, regardless of cumulative
average or financial need. And
even with no restrictions there is
usually a shortage of help for few
students are willing to take the
job. I

How much are we being paid?
Up until this semester the rate
was $1. per hr. This year this has
been raised to a scale of $1.10 -
$1.25 per hr. ‘

The scale is not low because we
are free from board charges. in-
deed we “suh'sldi'zei‘ ox wselves by
paying the -‘normal University
charge if living in a dormand have

. an equivalent sum withheld from

our pav if living in an apartment,
v if, on a given day, a student
helper works both breakfast and

7

supper he works between three and
four hours. If a man was hired full
time to replace the student, the
man would spend four hours of
his working day doing nothing; and
do you think he would receive only
$1.25 maximum for his services?

If you feel that a full-time worker
could replace several students you
are again in err. One man can do
only one job at a time.

It is at mealtimes that the num-
ber of jobs which be done inultl-
plies. The few chefs arepreparing
the food but other men are required
to serve 'it, give you coffee, wash
the trays, dishes, glasses, silver-
ware, etc. '

For each job which is now done
by a student one “full-time!" man
would be required. Would this re-
sult in saving money?

I therefore conclude that, con-
trary to your opinion, student help
should be maintained, the result
being a considerable savingrather
than an added expense to the student
body.

Defends Music Council

- To the Editor:

in response to the article on the
“classical stand" of Music Coun—
cil (Tuesday, November 2), l, as
vice president of Music Council,
would like to make a few ideas
clear.

In the first place. the members
(students) of Music Council, with-
out pressure from facility, plan
the program for the upcoming year.
Secondly, the program does meet
the musical desires of the faculty,
administration and student body of
this university. Concerts sponsored
by Music Council are both well-re-
ceived and well-attended. Thirdly,
Music Council’s traditional function
has been to bring to this campus the
finest artists, not the best enter-
tainers, in the musical field. With
the prospect of establishing a music
major at this university and with the
Increased interest in the type of
program sponsored by Music Coun-
cil, this tradition of presenting the
finest is justified by both a heritage
of time past and a future of new Lie-
velopments.

The program of Music Council.
like the University itself, efiects
a tradition of excellence. Members
of the Council feel that the A50 would
be more in keeping with this tra-
dition if it refrained from such un-
ethical practices as quoting (in a
front page story) a causal conver-
sation when the person involved
(Cheryl Flis) had no notion of its
journalistic intentions.

In conclusion, let me define the
rather nebulous term “classical
stand." Music Council considers
“classical” music as that music
which by its deeply universal appeal
will endure through time, certainly
not the music of unemotlve dryness
with which some people associate
the word classical. Classical mush-
is further enhanced by the artists
who perform the music and give to
the music that added creative insight
of sensitive masterfulperformance.
Therefore, the classical stand of
Music Council, astand which will not
be modified by externa pressure.

Louise Myers

Editor's reply:

Miss Myers is mistaken whenst
states that Music Counclleventsnrv
well attended. The opposite is both
true and obvious.

The statement that Music CUUllf'li
has not been dominated by Dr.
Stokes is a similar falsehood. He
refused to consider the Smothch
Brothers stating that they are not
productive of music.

The reason the ASP ran the pre-
vious article is the statement before
the old Student Senate by a past
president of Music Council that the
program would be well-rounded and
not restricted to the classical field.
Current policy makes this a he
also,

Mimic Council asked for and was
given an additional $5000 when it
Promised to present a program of
classical, folk, jazz and popuiul‘
music. We do not know if their re-
quest was based on deliberate lies
0r acctdentai ones,
