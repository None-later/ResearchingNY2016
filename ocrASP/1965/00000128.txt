Harriers Bow In Finale,
Fail at Record Attempt

An undefeated St. Peter’s cross-country squad
snapped the Dane’s seven meet winning streak at
Washington Park last Saturday, topping State, 27—
31. St. Peter’s preserved a three-year 17 meet
win streak with this victory which prevented the
Danes from registering a new win record of eleven.

Joe Keating, still
plagued with a muscle
injury. won individual

honors over Ed Marino,
St. Peter’s captain, after
a dogfight. Keating won in
25: 23.8 over the 4.55 mile
course.

Marina tried to lose Keating all
throughout the race, but the Glens
Falls sophomore held on to win by
over seventy yards.

Paul Durbln captured third in the
meet in 25:56. Bob Flick led four
Peacock runners to the tape in
placing fifth. He was timed in 26:06.

St. Peter’s won the meet on the
strength of the four runners coming
in sixth through ninth.

Dane Doug Garner tried valiantly
to break up the quartet, but he was
unable to despire the fact that he
clipped 6'] seconds off his previous
best effort in trying to.

Bob Muivey, still hampered by a
virus infection, rounded out Al-
bany’s scoring with a twelfth place
finish.

Coach Munsey lauded Keating and
Garner for their efforts. He wenton
to add that “Mulvey’s illness was a

a"

rap om: HARRIER Joo Kooting a.

big factor. He usually runs with or
ahead of Garner, and had he been
fully recovered from his coldlthink
we might have turned the trick.”

Munsey then stated that “I am
very proud of the effort my lads
showed, not only today, but all
through the season. They are the
scrapplest bunch of barriers I have
ever had.”

crowd of over 2,500 exuberant fans. the Al-

bany State varsity soccer team crushed a demoralized and weak C. W. Post
College squad, 5-0. on Vets Field last Saturday. The Great Danes completely
dominated the game, but it was not until the second half when the hooters
finally tallied. Post’s inability to mount an offense left the Danes free to move

the ball amost constantly deep into the laser’s territory.

Goalie Joe LaReau, who =
could have spent the game
in O'Heany's for all the
trouble he encountered.
was forced to come up
with only six saves in the
entire contest.

The first Dane score came at
2:13 of the third quarter on open-
alty kick by Maurice Tsododo. Tso-
dodo had missed a penalty kick in
the opening moments ofthe game, so
he was happy to vindicate himself
on this one.

Brian McMahon drove in a fine
hoot at 10:43 of the same quarter
off an assist by Tsododo.

Tsododo added another goal at
16:27 oi the third; this time he was
assisted by Getachew Habeth-Yim-
er.

Subs Strong
At the outset of the final session,
Dane Coach Joe Garcia began sub-
stituting freely. However, the State
hooters kept up a powerful attack.

Bill Haas booted home a score at
10:09 of the fourth, with an assist
from Gary Swartout.

Playing in his last college soccer
game, captain Udo Guddat closed out
his career in fine style with a goal
at 16:00 of the final period.

Moore's Lost Gomo
It was also the last game for
senior Jay Moore, who played a
fine game from his forward slot.

This was the last game for State’s
hooters. The team closed out the
season with a 4-6 record.

Interesting statistic on the game:
State took 46 shots at Post’s goal,
while Post managed only seven at
Albny's net.

into a colorful and rapidly growing
scholastic and club sport. Although
the game has been relatively
“civilized,” it has, nonetheless,
retained its basic element of vio-
lence.

Called the “fastest game on two
feet," lacrosse utilizes both indi-
vidual and team play, and because
of its wide open play and relatively
simple rules, it is both interesting
and understandable to the spectator.

There are ten players to a team
in lacrosse. Their objective is
simply to put the ball into the op-
ponent’s goal while preventing their
opponents from doing the same. The
rules, which are devised to protect
the player and speed up the game,
do little to otherwise interfere with
this objective.

A list of possible games include
games with the following teams:
RPI, Union, Siena, Williams, Am—
herst, Cortland, Hofstra and Post
frosh squads; and with the Syracuse
and New York lacrosse clubs.

A motion to further the scope of
salaried pooitions was defeated
three to two after an Open hearing
of the finance committee of Central
Council. The meeting was held on
Monday, November 8, and was open
to all areas covered by salaried
positions and those considering the
need for salaried members.

Members of the, newspaper,
WSUA, yearbook and Central Coun-
cil were present to give arguments
supporting and against the extension
of salaried positions. Funds for
these salaries would come from
the Student Association funds.

Technical Knowledge Noodod

Supporting statements were given
by WSUA staff members Bob'l‘amm,
Tad Parks, and Bill Alexander.
Their main points were based on
the expenditure of time and the
need for experienced and reliable
personnel.

Some members of the radio staff
spend from twenty to thirty hours
per week in the office. -It would be
impossible for these people to work
such hours without compensation.

Members of the Albany Student
Press, Joseph Galu and Edith Har-
dy, agreed with those members of
WSUA and Miss Hardy further stated
that salaries added a vote of con-
fidence on the part of the Student
Association.

She said that the subsidy given
to the paper is definitely a vote of
confidence, but to the organization,
not the people who worked for it.

Idealism

Dick Thompson, President ofStu-
dent Association stated that the re-
ward of a job well done would be
the reward for many people. Per-
sonal satisfaction should be the re-
ward fer a student's efforts,but this
he admitted, is an idealistic feeling.

Later in the discussion, Thomp-
son agreed that in many cases the
work load was too, great and perhaps
certain organizations needed paid
help in the form of secretaries.
Refutations to this suggestion were
many.

Douglas Upham said that it would
be impossible for the newspaper
to have a secretary to type things
in the form of articles, since many
articles are composed as they are
typed.

Mundane vs. Demanding

Sue Wade asked that if the Student
Assooiation would be willing to pay
outside help to do the “mundane”
duties, why not pay a student who'
is doing for more important work?

One of the basic factors involved
in extending salaries to more stu-
dents would be the obvious need to
draw lines somewhere.

In Open letter to Student Body

Student Association Richard Thompson has reacted
to the revelation that membership in‘S. A'.,is ‘v’olun-‘
tary with a letter addressed to the entire student body.
Thompson feels that the effects of the voluntary status
of the student tax will be slight if the student realizes
the purposes served by the tax.

The letter. written by
Thompson. is reproduced
in its entirety below.

“Since its inception in 1917, the
Student Association of this Uni-
versity has established a program
of great vpriety for members of

the Student Body.

“The information: that registra-
tion at the University is not con-
tingent upon payment of the Student
Activities fee, has raised the ques-
tion of whether or not students will
continue to support the Association’s
program by paying this fee.

“A drop in the Student Association
income would mean two things to
each student at the University.

"First of all, the programs ofthe
Student Association would have tube
drastically curtailed. Theorganiza-
tions that gain funds from the Asso-
ciation to finance their programs
would not be able to continue.

“The publications would not have
the money they need to work, and
then students would not be able to
pick them up free of charge.

“The second aspect to consider
is that only those students who pay
the student activities would be per-
mitted to join an organization of
the Student Association, vote in any
election, or hold any office.

“He would be depriving himself
the opportunity to iearn-by-doing
and also deprive his fellow students
of learning from him.

“But if each student would think
of the benefits he obtains from this
payment, and what he will not re-
ceive if he does not pay, I am con-
fident that the Student Association
will continue to have the whole-
hearted support of the Student Body.

“This University has progressed
in many areas in thepasi five years.
One of the most signiﬁcant has been
the degree of responsibility placed
with the Student Association.

“A drastic out back in income
will force the Student Association
to curtail its program. I urge each
student at the University to support

 

the Student Association. Without
your help, it cannot succeed."

V Eleanor Diener and Mike
Purdy are kicking off their
drive to raise funds for
Campus Chest tonight with
the annual Campus Chest
dance.

During next week, each student
will have the opportunity to buy
boosters in the peristyles. Sue Chap-
nick and Ross Stonefleid are in
charge of selling the boosters. Help
support your class and buyabooster
of your class color. A tally will be
kept in the peristyies to determine
which class has supported Campus
Chest the most.

Also in the peristyles during the
next week will bethe pictures of the
sorority and fraternity choices for
Miss Big Feet and Mr. Hair Do. To
vote for your favoriteﬁcandldate or
unfavorite candidate just put money

'in the can with that persons name
on it. A new campaign was started
last Monday to try to get professors
to run in an ugliest professor con-
test but nothing has been heard from
Ken Dormer or Steve Ostrove as
of yet about this.

It is also hoped that the members
of the faculty will contribute gen-
erously to the campaign when they
are contacted during the next week.
The funds collected from the faculty
as in the past will not go to the Al-
bany Community Chest as it is ex-
pected they are already contributing
locally.

Dance

The dance will be held from 8-12
p.m. in Walden dining hall. Admis-
sion will be $.50 and music will be

bany Community Chest.

Speakers

Last night, speakers from both
the World University Service and
the National Scholarship Serviceand
Fund for Negro students spoke to a
group of solicitors representing all
the dorms on the two campuses. It
is hoped that each student in his
own dorm will be in contact with
the solicitor in his dorm and will
give generously to this worthy cause.

Sunday night at 8:00 at the new
Campus dining room, Campus Chest
will hold another college bowl. Sue
Morris and Dennis Martin are co-
chairmen of this event. The parti-
cipants in this college bowl are
members from each sorority and
fraternity, and three independents.
Admission to this event is $3.5.
