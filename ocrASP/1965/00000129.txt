has not been compulsory since 1948,
'most students had been under the
impression that they could not reg-

Dr. Collins suggested that the

sanction compulsory student fees,
but admitted ‘that it would be on

Morel Obligation ,
"‘When students vote ices upon
themselves," said’ Collins, l‘they
incur a moral obligation to support
the activities of the group." r
While he acknowledged the iact,
'that‘neither the university nor the
Student Association could compel a
student to pay the tax, he empha-
sized that that student had an ob-
ligation to refrain from taking ad-
vantage oiany oi the opportunities
oiiered by Student-Association. 

The question oi'athletic tax was
raised. Currently, students pay an
annual assessment of $17.50-for
athletics. This fee is established
by President Collins upon rec‘om-
mendation oi the Athletic Advisory
Board, a student group.»

Then-student activity assessment

.oi $24.50 annually is. levied by
Central Council oi Student Asso-
ciation. Both the athletic tax and
the student activity assessment are
grouped together as student tax.

AthletIc-Activlty Tex

Dr. Collins was asked if mem-
bership in Student Association could
be made contingent upon payment at
the athletic tax as well as the stu-
dent activity assessment. He re-
plied that “the intent is still that
athletic tax be a part of student
tax.”

He was also asked that ii Stu-
dent Association makes payment oi
the athletic tax a requirement of
membership, should it not then have
control over how the money is
spent?

He replied that "intercollegiate
athletics involves the whole insti-
tution," and that one oi the bases
for membership in most athletic
associations is “that control oi
athletics be in the educational 'lead-
ership of the institution."

Bus’ Crowding Due to Impatience

.The average loads ior these times
were 75, 74 and 12 respectively.

Buses leave Draper every ten
minutes starting at 4:20. Many oi
these are nearly empty, while
others are overcrowded.

Dr. Thorne pointed out that it
is expected that some students
will have to stand. There is no
ability to obtain a seat for every
students. But he added that the
University’s agreement with the
United Traction Company allows
increases and decreases in serv-
ice at any time.

The crowding of the buses taking
students to and from the new cam-
pus was a topic oidiscussionat the
last two press conferences.held
with University President Collins.

Vice President Thorne and Miss
Edsall provided information that
shows that the-crowding is due to
hurry to get back to the new cam-
pus and the attempts to avoid the
University owned buses.

Miss Edsaii provided the, ASP
with figures compiled a week or

The program on disadvantaged
youth needs college students major-
ing in any subject to work as volun-
teer tutors for junior and senior
high school students. Most of these
students have college potential but
because of various environmental
problems are not performing up to
their ability.

Tutor ng sessions can be arranged
to suit ndividual convenience. Even
if a college student can only tutor
once every two months he is needed.

Transportation is provided free
