stars, the State squad is

But this has been-a rebuilding year at Albany, and
both the soccer. and cross-country teams did re-
markably well as “rebuilt” squads“

Before dismissing the past season, we should like
to quickly analyze the two varsity teams and see if
we can pinpoint the reasons for their success.

, The cross-country team compiled a 10-2 record.
The main reason is the coach — R. Keith Munsey.
Our analysis should stop here, for. as we pointed,
out last week. it is virtually impossible to rationalize

the man’s knack for winning.

/

Munsey did get some “help” from such stars as
Joe Keating, who had an outstanding year. and rookie
Paul Durbin, who had never before ran cross-country

, until this year. If Munsey were writing this article,
we’re sure he wouldinclude every member of the team.
We would too, if space permitted. Having losteight out
ten men from last year’s team, Munsey performed a

minor miracle.

For soccer coach Joe Garcia. this past season must
have been one of the most frustrating he has ever
endured. The team’s mark was only 4-6, yet that
included two one-point losses and upset wins over
Montclair and Brooklyn College. And then there was
that Homecoming win. With only three seniors on the-
team, Coach Garcia can hope, with some assurance.
of a more rewarding year next fall.

ALBANY STATE'S VARSITY CROSS-COUNTRY TEAM poses
with its proud coach, R. Keith Munsey. The Dane Harriers corn-
piled a line l0-2 record in this, a rebuilding year. The horriers

(tront row) Joe Keating, Mike.Parker, Ken Klrilr, Jim Malloy,
Bob Flick. With only three seniors leaving the team, and with
a strong trosh squad coming up, Coach Munsey's smile should

grow even bigger next year.

Season Successful

The Albany State Varsity Cross-
Country team finished its "worst"
season in three years, by posting
a ten win two loss record. Tile bar-
riers were led all season by sen-
sational sophomore runner Joe
Keatlng, who won all except three
of the dual meets that he ran in.

State’s first loss came at the
bands of a powerful iioly Cross
squad by the score of 84-24. This

,_ loss snapped the barriers‘ dual
* meet win streak of twenty, covering
a three year period.

The other loss came in the last
meet of the season to St. Peter's,
who had won seventeen in a row,
27-30. The sickness of number four
runner Bob Mulvey made the dif-

ference between winning and losing.

The barriers' other leading run-
ners besides Keating and Mulvey
were co-captains Bob Flick and
Ken Kirik, transfer Paul Durbin,
and Junior Doug Garner.

The Albany STate freshman cross-country team
finished its finest season in the three year history of
the team. The yearlings, paced all season by Don

were sixth in twelve teams at the Le Moyne Invita-

Beavers and Atweli vied for first place hono’rs in

The State frosb soccer team could do no better
than a 1-2-6 record this past season under the guid-
ance of Coach Bill Schleffelin. The record does not,
however, indicate the caliber of the yearling's play,
as the,team dropped five contests by one point.

The team started off the year with a come-from-
behind 4-3 win over Coblesklli A&T. in that contest,
Dane Yutulo Silio accounted for all of State's scores
in one of the finest one man shows we have witnessed
at Albany.

The team also vied with five Junior college teams,
and yet the Danes did hold their own.

Outstanding for the freshman hooters was, of course,
Silio, who Was the driving force behind the team’s of-
fense. Others worthy of praise include Paul Reinert,
the goalie; Craig Springer, who alternated line and
backfield positions; iiaroid Toretczsky, Dennis Jer-
sey and John Namowitz, outstanding as bali’backs;
and Pete Nakos, the team’s center fullback.

Coach Scbieffelln was impressed with the team's
hustle and desire, and was especially pleased attimes
with the squad's passwork.

RICHARD THOMPSON, PRESIDENT ol Cen-

tral Council discusses the various aspects ot

Activity Assessment, Attitude Toward

the new student government over WSUA Sunday.

Activities Discussed by Thompson

Bob Tamm of WSUA and
Dick Thompson. President
of Student Association dis-
cussed varied aspects of
student life on Comment,
November 14.

Many questions arose over the
recent discussion of student ac-
tivity assessment and the students'
feelings toward activities and aca-
demic life.

Thompson clarified his position
on the so-culled “idealistic ap-
proach" by stating that he feels the
student’s reward through witness-

lu Deliver Address
it faculty Service

President Evan it. Collins will do-
liver the main address at the
Thanksgiving service for faculty and
students ofall faiths Sunday, Novem-
ber 2i at 7:30 p.1n. at the First
Lutheran Church, 181 Western Ave.

The event will be highlighted by
the theme of unity in worship and
our American heritage. The hour-
long service will begin with n pray-
er emphasizing thanksgiving.

Presideut Collins will base his
address on a scripture selection.

The service will also include a
responsive reading and a reading
of a poem or some other creative
piece on thanksgiving by a faculty
member.

The ceremony is sponsored by
Canterbury, Campus Christian
Council, Lutheran Student Asso-
cintion, NewnmnAssoclution, llillel,
TRYADS, Christian Science, Chan-
ning Club and inter Varsity Chris-
tian Fellowship.

The American theme will be
brought out by a reading of Presi-
dent Johnsou's Thanksgiving Day
Preciamution. The congregation will
sing traditional American hymns
such as "We Gather Together" and
“Come Ye Thankful People."

The old colonial Lutheran Church
is an appropriate setting for the
service silica this church has the
oldest, continuous Lutheran con-
gregation in America.

Twelve students are working on
the program along with several
Faculty members who are helping
in the planning of the service.

v vows-oeuv- .

ing the results of a "job well done"
is not idealistic, but realistic. The
students in his estimation do not
wish to have each position a paid
one; they do the work for the en-
joyment, the experience or the ac-
complishment.

Student participation has tradi-
tionally been a voluntary thing. in
this manner, the student would not
expect to have his time monetarliy
reimbursed. Also, the main moti-
vation in joining in any activity
should not be the payment of a
salary.

in Thompson’s opinion, the gen-
eral student body does not want to
see their funds used to pay certain
individuals a salary for a job they
have taken voluntarily. These funds
are paid for the promotion of the
activities of the general program of
activities.

Politics has been discussed by
probably everyone, practically ni-
wnys, and the general trend ofopin-
ion toward politics is that ii is a
“dirty game." Thompson disagrees
with this position, and feels that the
university level is the place toerase
such feeling and replace it with a
more healthy attitude.

To do this job, the student gov-
ernment must create a wholesome
workshop for developingrespotisible
citizens. This would be the place
and time to learn to deal with the
people who are attempting to for-
mulate student legislation.

The job of reasoning with people
and explaining what you feel would
be a worthy piece of legislation is
often the best and usually the only
method of seeing your ideas he-
come reality.

One of the biggest potential prob-
lems seen by Thompson is the pos-
sible relationship between the com-
missions and the Central Council.
The idea of the new governinth is
that of having much of iheprogram-
ming done at the commission level.
This is where the legislation should
originate.

This then must he the duty of the
commission areas: to initiate logis-
lation and to carry out these enact-
rneuts without having the decision
handed down to them by the Council.
if this is not done, the end product
of the new government will be noth-
ing more than a “bigger Senate."

Film (titles to" Debate;
During English EVening

The English Evening Committee will present a
verbal battle between Pauline Kael and Andrew Sar-

ris.

two noted film critics who hold conﬂicting

theories of cinema criticism on Thursday, Novem-
ber 18. The topic for the discussion, based on their
main point of disagreement is “Is there a Religion of

Film?”

Dr. Joan Schulz, chair-
man of the committee, will
be in charge of the evening
in the lower lounge of Bru-
bacher Hall. Dr. Schulz
emphasized that all would
be welcomed.

Are movies really a serious art
form? Or, are the movies the one
serious art form of the mid-twen-
tieth century? These are some of
the questions that will underlie the
discussion between Miss Kael and
Sarrls.

The battle between Andrew Sar-
rls and Pauline Kael is a long-
standing one. it first got significant
public notice in the spring of1963
when in the spring issue of “Film
Quarterly" Vol 16, Miss Keel pub-
lished her article "Circles and

uarss.”

in this article, Kael took a neg-
ative View of the politique des au-
teres, an idea of criticism to which
Sarris vigorously adheres. The
poiithue des auteres is a "policy of
focusing cinemacritlcism primarily
upon directors, and specifically upon
certain chosen directors Whose in-
dividuality of style qualified them
as auteurs — creators in the per-
sonal sense we accept for other
arts." '

Miss Kael contends that Sarris
bases his pro-autere argument on
"not only aesthetics but on a rather
odd pragmatic statement: Thus to

argue against the autere theory in
America is to assume that we have
anyone of Bazin's (French Critic)
sensibility and dedication to pro-
vide an alternative, and we don't."

Miss Kael hoped that “Sarris’
humility does not camouﬂage his
double-edged argument." The first
autere premise which Kael attacks
is that the technical competence of
the director as a criterion of value.

Kael retorted that “in works of
lesser rank, technical competence
can help to redeem the weaknesses
of the material." The second of
Sarris’ arguments attacked is the
distinguishable personality of the
director as a criterion of value.

To this, Miss Kael succinctly
stated, “The smell of a skunk is
more distinguishable than the per-
fume of a rose, does that make it
better?"

Kael answered Sarris by pointing
out that interior meaning equals
meaning. That Sarris' idea goes
against the conventional grain of
criticism is pointed to by Keal.
The material does not count for
Santa; only what the director does
what it counts.

Sarris answered Miss Kaei’s at-
tack, and the verbal fight has con-
tinued.
