Several years ago, a course guide

enumerating student ' evaluation of
courses and professors at the Univer-
sity was published. But because of lack
of student assistance it folded.

This guide can be a valuable asset to
the student especially when he is making
out his schedule. It‘ can let him 'know
“what he is getting himself in for” when
he signs up for a course.

This guide has become even more'

important as the University’sfaculty has
grown in size and it becomes difficult

for a student to know the professo'rlfivhose '

course he wants to take.

We would welcome another attempt by
an organization on campus to publish
such a guide. We feel that this guide
will fast become a necessity to the
student body. . ' -‘.> ‘ ‘

Maya Man B'e'tliiistiaii‘!

The action taken by Albany Catholic
Diocese in silencing Father Bonaven-
ture O’Brien is as corrupt a step as
could be taken by a church.

Father Bonaventure's actions in no
way contradict any Church teaching. In
fact, his actions seem to be necessary
inasmuch as it is the Christian’sobli-
gation “seek Christ in the betterment
of man."

Moderate and liberal Catholic lay
people and clergymen are aghast at the
action taken rather obviously at the re—
quest of some local politicans.

We are aghast to find such a strong
action taken by a hidden man in the
time of sickness of the bishop and the
absence of the auxiliary bishop. Cer-

 

 

 

tainly the actions of this 'one man dis-
grace upon all Catholics in the diocese.

It hardly seems possible that when
the Church is taking steps toward giving
lay people a greater role in the Church
and' when the Popes issue statements
'like' “Mother and Teacher" that a local
politician-clergyman can be out of the
main stream of his own religion and
still be allowed to act for hundreds of
thousands of Catholics.

We praise the actions of the South
Enders and of the students of Siena.
We abhor the action of the Church in
bowing to the political wishes on men
with no interest in the future.

Perhaps the signs welcoming people
to Albany should include signs put up
by the local Catholic Church stating
“Welcome to Albany where Catholics
are not allowed to be Christian.”

Needs Support

Two weeks ago S‘Thursday.’.’ amimeo- .

graphed literary weekly. made its debut
on campus and joined the ever growing
list of mimeographed publications.

We are heartened to see these pub-
lications on campus and feel that they
enhance the University’s intellectual at-
mosphere. They have great potential in
arousing discussion and intereston cam—
pus.

One of the weaknesses of these “half—
shod" publications is that they have not
always been able to receive student sup-
port in form of articles or financial
contributions.

Without this support they cannot pub-
lish. We hope that this does not happen
and urge students to back these publi-
cations by contributing articles and
money.

The ASP continuesfibepécome increasingly dis-

turbed by the attitude-“towardthe students taken by
the residence hall‘directors‘of this university.

It is not bad enough that not one of the residence
directors had even the flimsiest excuse for creating

, the impression'that dorm dues are mandatory. We now

face the situation where; at least one director had
been dictating how the money collected is to be used.

This money was taken from the students under an
insulting guISe. It seems that the attitude of directors
in saying that half the money is for the small units-
within the new dorms and the other half is for the hall
as a whole is again wildly presumptuous.

We do not like being placed in the position where it
is necessary to view the actidns of, these residence
halls directors with suspicion. Such is now the case.
We will not have the residents of these buildings
treated as if they are docile fools. Such seems to be
the opinion of several dorm directors.

We abhore the attitude and the mind that can call a
freshman diabetic " a burdenon everyone around her."
We expect a level of professionality that is totally
abset in the personalities of several current direc-

tors.

We urge the students who are being mistreated and
slandered by these directors to take their problems
to the Deans of Students. The director of aj residence
is not the final authority in much of anything. If you.
feel you have been campused or evenreprimanded

unfairly or unreasonably,
someone responsible.

GOLDEN EYE

This Friday’s discussion
at the Golden Eye, a cof-
feehouse sponsored by the
Campus Christian Council,
will be "The Great Si-
lence.” The discussion is
expected to concern itself

with the silenCing of Fa—
ther Bonaventure O’Brien
and the relationship be-
tween the local pelitical
leaders and the local Cath-
olic Church.

Criticizes Audience
To the Editon

Friday night’s performance of
"Of Mice and Men" was executed
by a fine group of young actors who
were perhaps not the most brilliant,
but certainly fresh and rather unl-
que. i give credit totheséextremely
talented students and especially to
Charles Bartlett who portrayed Len-

However, I was dismayed that one
element of this play was lacking in
'good taste (i believe manners would
be a better word) and that element
was the audience. Those who at-
tended Frlday’s performance will
undoubtedly agree that the audience
reactions were at times uncalled for
and definitely showed a lack of per-
ception on their part.

Naturally the play had its humor-
ous segments. But, dramatic effect
was greatly reduced when, for ex-
ample, the audience felt that Len-
nie’s admission of doing something
wrong (strangling Curly’s wife) was
humorous.

The play, 1 felt, was meant to be
moving and to evoke an emotional
response. The filial scene left many
unable to applaud for several min-
utes. Was this the affect Steinbeck
and the State University was striv-
ing toward?

Perhaps we should re-exomlne a
most vital part of play production
— that is, our role as the audience.

Actions Unreasonable
To the Editor:

In regard to the article “Thorns
Praises Students' Actions During
Massive Power Failure,” therewas
no mention made of orders given to
dormitory directors in regard to
keeping students confined in cite
area for the duration of the black-
out.

In Pierce liall, all students were
required to remain eilher in the
dining room or the lngle Ronni,
and were not allowed to return to
their respective room unless ac-
companied, to and from, by Mrs.
Rand.

Since we feel that this action
was unreasonable, we would like
to know whether or not the same
policy was followed in other dor-
mitories; and if so, on what auth-
oriiy.

George’l-la’rder’s allega-
tion that Daniel P. O’Con-
nell was behind the silen-
cing of Father Bonaven-
ture O’Brien provided the
main highlight of last Fri-
day night’s Golden Eye.

Harder, an insurgent Democrat, -

spoke along with the Rev. Val Men-
des, the editor of The Albany Mir-
ror: The Voice of Poverty, and Ed
Rock, the unsuccessful Republican
candidate in the newly created 112m
district.

Each man presented is short talk
on the political and social conditions
in Albany. Harder's speech pro-
vided the interesting points that the
Republican poll watchers allow the
Democratic machine to get away with-
hundreds of election law violations.

0.. Albany Political ’Ctmditions;

Harder criticized the attitude that
equates good government with anew
traffic light delivered just before
primary day. He referred in par-
ticular to a high ranking localCath-
olic churchman who praised the
machine Just before primary day for
the new light-at St. James Place and
Delaware.

lie also noted the same form of
praise was given when a water line
was extended to a seminary. These
are examples of what a government
should do, but they ai'enotlndlcative
of a well run government.

Harder criticized the View that
“Uncle Dan” (county chairman
O’Connell) is a charitable and lov-
liig man. Harder asked about where
Uncle Dan gets all the money he
supposedly gives away.

Contract
. He said that charity Is a contract
when ii is given by O'Connell.
Rook proclaimed the Republican
party as being a logical organ for

 

 awn.

changing Albany. ' .

in the questions which foilowed
their addresses, Rook insisted that
Albany county Republican leader
Conway has always done all he could
to promote the fortunes of the Re-
publican candidates.

Fear of Revolt
Mr. Mendes stated his bellef that
the Albany Democratic machine

fears President Johnson’s proverty r

program because it would place
money directly into the hands of the
poor. This money would provide the
poor with some power.

This power would make the poor
less dependent on the O'Connell
machine.

Rook asked for the Republicans
to change their policy and conduct
active political campaigns for all
judgeshlps, except where a re-
spected jurist ls running for re-
election.

He also complained ihat the lie-
publicans are “psychologically
dominated" by the Democrats.
