Coach Garcia thinks he has some
very fine prospects out for the team

with wrestling experience out for the

that five “ real good prospects” did
not come out for the team due to per-
sonal reasons.

The team opens up its season on
December 4 with a quadrangular
meet with Williams, Hartwick and
Hunter here in Albany.

Garcia said "This is the first
quadrangular meet ever held in the
tri-cities. There will be a trophy
for the first place team as well as
for the individual winners.”
