Salishury to Speak
On Mars Botany

Noted plant biologist Dr.‘ Frank
Salisbury will speak on plantbiology
with respect to life on Mars, Mon-
day afternoon, November 22. The
talk is sponsored by the Biology
Club and the biology department.

The author of two books, “The

Flowering Process" and “Truth
by Reason and Revelation” (science
and religion), Dr. Salisbury is a
professor of plant physiology at
Colorado State University. He re-
ceived his B.S. and iii.A. from the
University of Utah and his Ph.D.
from California Institute of Tech-
nology.
In 1962 and 1068, Dr. Salisbury
spent time in Germany and Austria
as a National Science Foundation
Fellow. At that time, he toured all
the maJor plant laboratories in Eu-
rope and in Moscow.

Presently, his research concerns
the physiology of flowering and space
biology (response of plants to high
intensity light, life on Mars), under
the National Science Foundation,the
National Institute of lieaith, and the
Nationai Aeronautical and Space Ad-
ministration.

Father Bonave

If the Church backs down, it could
mean the end of the so-rallcd deal
between Daniel l1. O’Connell, the
Albany County chairman of the Dem-
ocratic party, and the local bishop,
currently Bishop Scuiiy, aman wide-
ly regarded as being senile and too
Sltfl’. to take care of” his duties.

The background for the story in-
cludes the 44 year dominance of the
local Democratic organization and
the extremely conservative Catholic
Church of the Albany Diocese.

The newspaper of the local dio-
cese, "The Evangelist,“ is con-
sidered to be one of the most con-
servative Catholic papersin Amor-
ica. A recent proof of this was the
complete absence of coverage ofthe
theological-social discussions at
Catholic University in Washington.

The local Catholic Church

porters of both the index and the

visor and as s mend." He said that
he was "amazed that the Diocese oi
Albany and the Holy Name Province
of the Franciscan Order have seen
fit to limit his activities."

Basis of Change

Father O’Brien,
Martin, "has realized that social
progress means institutional
change, and he has worked for this
change.” ‘

Martin concluded his statement
with the statement: “I have only
the greatest respect and love for
the Catholic Church and its teach-
ings. Yet in this case it seems to
me that the Church has openly con-
tradicted its own teachings.”

This statement was applauded
longer and more loudly than any of
the other statements made. Many
of the students who were seated in
the “stands rose to applaud him.

The student leaders who spoke
emphasized the points that their
objection was to the Church's atti-
tude, that it was the Church action
which is culpable, and that the stu-
dent roie is to enforce the protests
and desires of the South Enders.

Unmeunlngful Method

To do otherwise, they concluded,
would be to be labelled irrespon-
sible demonstrators.

in the question period which fol-
lowed, several students raised the
question of whether supporting the
south Enders snowed sufficientsup—
port for Father O’Brien.

The vast majority seemed to sup-
port the reply that a demonstration
of students would be dismissed as
meaningless

Common Market
Subject of Speech

on Monday, November 15,Dr.Cohen

sidelights of the Common Market.

Dr. Cohen's speech included a
history of the attempts to unin

pointed out possible political ino-

economic community, and that the
 is not merely a customs
union but an entire economic sys-

The Common Market and Its ex—

Profile of Freshmen Class
Reveals Well-Rounded .Class

by Nancy Felts

The Director of Admissions re-
cently released an annual summary
of our freshman class. ills report,
entitled “Profile of a Class -- Sep-
tember 1965,” strongly indicates
that the freshman class is bigger
and better than ever before.

The number of applications re-
ceived totaled 6670. SUNYA accepted
3307 of those candidates, turning
away 425 well-qualified freshman
applicants “whom we would have
liked to serve."

This year's freshman class is
more academically well-rounded
than any previous one. The Direc-
tor’s report included many iinpres-
sive statistics. These include the
number of units that the average
freshman has taken in high school.

According to the report,the aver-
age freshman has taken 4.1 units
of English, 3.8 units of social sci-
ence, 3.8 units of language, 3.7
units of math and 3.5 units of sci-

 

ence.

The freshman class is almost
entirely composed of students who
were in the top fifth of their classes
in high school. 6.3% of the class
were valedlotorians or salutatorians
of their graduating highschool clas-

es.

Recipients of regents scholar;
ships compose 40.6% of the class,
16.891 of the class are the recipi-
ents of other scholarships.

The report included personal data,
'some of which is very interesting.
As in past years, the percentage
of female students (546015 slightly
larger than that of male students
(469;). The average ireshman’s age
upon admission was 17.8 years.

Due to the large number of ap-
plications, the Office of Admissions
has reinstated its Early Decision
Program. Acceptances will be
mailed out as early as December 1.
It Is expected that these appoint-
meiits will constitute mostly A and
B-plus quality applicants.

The “black out” that

'dsrkened Albany and most

of the Northeast last week
has been attributed to a
broken relay at a Canadian
power plant on the N iagara
River.

The break in the relay was caused
by excessive overloading of the six
power lines going into the Sir Adam
Deck plant number 2 in Queenston,
Ontario. Over 1.6 million ilowatts
were being pumped into this plant
at one time, and its capacity was
not great enough to meet such a
demand.

As the relay broke, the 1.6 mil-
lion kilowatts were transferred to
U. S. distributing facilities, causing
a rapid increase of frequency and
a massive surge of power that
could not he handled.

Safely equipment chain reaction
that had been set up to guard against
situations such as the one that fol-
lowed failed to operate, and the re-
result was the complete collapse
of the services of most New Eng-
land and Southern New York State
power systems.

The problem of starting up again
was enormous. Any generator that
began supplying current Would be
linn’icdiately overloaded by the vast
network of systems that were stand-
ing by, just waiting for power. In
this case the generator would be

safety device — the rircmtln-eaker.

area had in be isolated and the ill-
dividual generators brought intoliiie

The situation would have war-
ranted the declaration of a state of
national emergency, but it was afraid
that such a step would cause too
much panic. Most (:lllZellS accepted

New York City was perhaps the

standed in rush-hour subways, and

Albany students were praised by
