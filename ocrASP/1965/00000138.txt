In this situation the picture is com-

The men of Siena are correct in
centering their attention on the Church’s
error. The action of the Church was ap-
parently at. the request of the city.,The
city deserves to be criticized to the
extent of its role. The Church's attitude
is not only inhumane, it is unjust and un-
Christian.

Fraternity Influence ,

A fraternity can exist on many levels.
One of these levels is that on which the
group has an effect on an individual out-
side the group.

The Edward Eldred Potter Club, better
known as Potter, has been working onan
individual who is not even technically a
member of the University community.

There is a man who has been seen and
continues to be seen around the campus
with many of the men in Potter. He is,

At least partially through the influence
of several members of Potter, he is now
back in high school.

We do not believe that this is any
heroic action either by Potter or by the
individual. We recognize its importance
for the individual. We congratulate the
men who exercised what influence they

There has been'no control of the stu-

The posters, once regulated, approved,
thung and taken down bythe Campus Com-
mission, are now placed everywhere and
are now worded and designed in manners
varying from artistic to offensive:

The ghost writer poster on a bulletin
board intended for publicizingUniversity
events is a symbol of the present lack
of control of posters.

The Solicitations Commission has is-
sued a notice telling those people who
violate their rules to admit their guilt
and remove their illegal posters.

This is not the way to achieve a
controlled situation. We do not consider
it necessarily to be the job of the So-
licitations Commission to police the
walls of the campus.

A determination should be made and
made soon as to who should do this
needed job. '

In any case someone should be su-
pervising the walls and the student mail
much more closely than has been the
case so far this year.

POLITICAL FORUM

Negotiations Willi

Vietnam. Begin

Witirout Preconditions to Peace

by D. Gordon Upham

A great many people mistakingly
believe that the United States will
begin imconditionel negotiations with
the antagonistic parties involved in
South Vietnam. This only partly true.

President Johnson has repeatedly
maintained that no conditions exist.
But upon further examination, one
discovers that he really means that
the United States will negotiate with-
out preconditions for a peace.

Preconditions are different from
conditions. By preconditions, it is
meant that no concessions be made
prior to negotiating. The NorthViet-
namsse have stated preconditions
as prerequisites to negotiating.

The United States, on the other
hand, agrees to negotiate if certain
objectives will be reached by the
negotiations. In other words, the
United States will discuss the war
with North Vietnam and/or the Viet
Cong only if the agreement which
is made embodies the demands made
by the United States.

Similarity of Positions

The North Vietnamese position
requires the United States to make
concessions prior to a peace stin-
ference. The most important of
these concessions is that the Uni-
ted States withdraw its troops from
South Vietnam and that South Viet-
nam be free from foreign domina-
tion.

The United States also requires
that any solution must allow South
Vietnam to be free from foreign

domination.

The North Vietnamese would gain
from the withdrawal of U'. S.;troops
as a precondition. The reason ,for
this is clear. Not long after the
withdrawal, the government of South
Vietnam would be overthrown by
native South Vietnamese Commu-
nists and other members of the
National Liberation Front. This
would be without any foreign inter-
ference.

If the conditions proposed by the
United States were accepted by North
Vietnam, the United States would be
able to remain in South Vietnam
until elections could be held which
would be free from foreign (Com-
munist) inﬂuence.

Power Positions Changing

At present both sides have re-
fused to compromise the principles
which they have stated. North Viet-
nam in the past was in the better
position and was not willing to com-
promise because of the successes
of the Viet Cong. North Vietnam is
now beginning to realize that the
United States is improving its posi-
tion in South Vietnam, and this may

cause North Vietnam to reevaluate
'lts stance.

The United States is gradually
changing the positions of power in
Vietnam. The repeated bombings of
.North Vietnam, which are gradually
destroying the basis of the indus-
trial economy, and the increasingly
superior military advantagefn South
Vietnam are guaranteeing that any
settlement will be largely on terms
decided by the United States.

I COMMUNICA TIONS I

Questions Sriencmg
To tne Editors:

The ‘silencing’ of Father Bona-
venture of Siena College raises some
interesting points which the Catholic
Church, or at least its representa-
tives in the Albany diocese, is going
to have to consider and answer.

1) Since Father Bonaventure’s
actions were the application of the
Christian ethic, are we to assume
that the Church maintains a dual
nature: a Catholic ethic and aChris-
tian responsibility?

If therp is no distinction between
the two; then obviously the party
responsible for ‘cailing-off' the
priest has abandoned hisproper duty
as a cleric in reaction to outside
pressures.

2) In vlhe current Ecumenical
movement, the Church is making
4 " efforts to more ac-

tively relate itself to a contemporary
environment, to take a more ener-
getic role in alleviating ihepnrticu-
far problems of this generation.

is the Albany diocese so for re»

moved from the Ecumenical spirit
that it can negate its social obli-
gations, or is this, after all, the
true depth of the Ecumenical move-
ment itself?

3) Finally, what value does Caih~
olicism, or its Albany represents-
tives, place upon individual cons-

cience if it can so arbitrarily refute
and stifle the moral efforts of a
rational man?

Does the Church of Rome com-
pletely invalidate the possibility of
morality and rationality on any level
but that of official dogma?

The most tragic result of this
action is that questions like these
must arise at all.lfthis action were,
as it now appears to be, simply a
desire to avoid political involvement
as a rebult of Father Bonaventure’s
outspoken participation in contro-
versial issues, it was a poorly cal-
culated risk.

Political neutrality in this in-
stance could only be purchased at
the price of moral neutrality. As
it is now, the 'censoring’ of Slena's
theologian rnusi provoke serious and
sobering thoughts on the Church's
role in the community and the extent
of its commitment to a social gospel.

it is to be hoped that the answers
will reflect the convictions ofAsaph
who charged the Christian to:‘

'Give Justice to the weak and
the fatherloss; maintain the
right of the afflicted and
the destitute.

Rescue the weak and the needy”
deliver them from the hand
of the wicked."

- Building Better Bridge

by Harry Nuckols

John Mureness, a part-time sin-
1 here at State, has been this
riter's frequent partner in many

plicate games in this area. He

5 been playing bridge for only a-
ery short time, but has already
cqufred many of the skills of a
ne player.

This week’s hand was played by
iureness a short time ago in a
sine in town. North’s first hid
bowed a real club suit and about
11 opening bid. South’s bid of five
patles was excellent. It was really
. sacrifice attempt, his hand is bad
or defense.

Mur‘eness won the opening lead
n the durnmy and played the king
and ace of trump, exhausting the
pponeuts. lie then led a low club
from his hand. West rose with the
ace and returned another diamond.

This" almost has to be the correct
)loy. if South has a singleton club,
he must have five cards in the red

V, Stills, and must give up either a

diamond trick and one or more
hearts, or he must lose two heart
tricks eventually.

The diamond return was trumped
in the South hand and the pressure
on West was applied by playing out
all the remaining trump from the

 South hand. West can afford to pitch

us diamond and one card in eat-h
l the other suits, but when the lust
rump is played, he’s dead.

before the last trump is played,
he dummy is down to one heart
md four clubs. if West discards. u

are all good.

If, as was the ease, West throws
the heart queen, South can still dis-
card a heart from the dummy and
lead his ten of clubs. If \Vest cov-

If he doesn’t (he didn't), aheari

probably guessed, is called a
squeeze play. It is one of the most
difficult plays to recognize, and it
is also a lot of fun to make.

by Marie Cunningham

Mademoiselle Madeleine Bour-,
set is .one of four French re-
search-observers —on this campus;
this year. As “agregees,” she and
the other students are in the pro-
cess of researching for their doc-
toral theses and are on scholar-
ships co-sponsored by the French
and United ,States Governments

which allow them to study in the '3
. United States.

Mlle. Bourset is studying for
her Ph.D. in history. One of the
others is in the English depart-
ment. There are, altogether, 190
students in the United States this
year. .
October Application

Last October, Mlle. Bourset, a
graduate of the Sorbonne and a
Fullhrlghi Scholar, applied for the

PANEL 'STUDIES ECONOMIC, political and social context at
Ayn Rand's works at discussion moderated by Cynthia Goodman.

' thesis,
thie United stateafrom‘the Amer;

gram to arch on he ,
"French immigration in

lean, Revolution to the Present."
thn‘ 'she was offered a position
in ’the History Department here,"
she accepted. -

Mlle. 3011th will do her re-
search on this campus, in the New
York Libraries, and in the National
Archives in Washington. She an-
ticipates that it will take her six
or eight years to ,complete it.

Her stay will include the aca-
demic year and while she is here
she is an observer in the History
3A class under Drs. DeWitl Ellin-
wood, Clara Tucker, and Mr. War-
ren Roberts.

V Sarbonne Large

Mlle. Bourset‘said that the Sor-
bonrre is much larger than Albany,
with 40,000 students, and that be-
cause of overcrowding, classes are
handled primarily on a lecture
basis. Located on the Left Bank
in the famed Latin Quarter, she
said that the Sor'bonne has several
annexes, but only for foreign lan-
guages.

Founded in the lath century by
Robert de Sorbon, chaplain of St.
Louis, it was first a dormitory
system for the University ofParfs,
There are almost no extra-curric-
ular activities on the campus.

Asked to comment aboutAlbany,
Mlle. Bourset replied that she
found the city quite small, andthat
she missed the theater but she
plans to attend an American Broad-
way plny and a concert at the Lin-
coln Center sometime during the.
year.
Although she prefers classical
music, Mlle. Boursei is also in-
ter‘ested in American folk singing.

Panel Discusses Works of Ayn Rand
Raises Question of Social Welfare

by Cynth io Goodman

One of the must f'nsrinatlng as-
pects of the Ayn ltuml panel held
November (in! was llul r'mrlr‘ust be-
tween what was discussed, and what
the panel had intended to discuss.

Despite the valiant efforts of the
panel, the disrussirm inexorably
moved from a phllnsopbicnl muni-
fruition uf ()luer‘tivism, m a study of
Ayu’s economic, political antisocial
context.

llr. Mark lier'gci' precipitated the
move whor. be injected info the mu-
versulrnu the question of social wei-
f’m'e,

“Winn frustrates me is that we

One of Homer’s primary reasons

vrdual in be sufficient i'liillll on the
rights or possessions of number.

"Rational Sell-internist"

One of the key phrases. uqu in
the course of the evening was “ru-
irunul self-interest,” uphr'ase which
Misr- ltuuri uses to describe her
beliefs.

As Lester Gl‘otlllllel'g outlined his
posilirm (which be emphasized was
his interpretation of Objoclfvfsm
and in no way u ‘conrrnftmeni' of
MISS Rand), the most compelling
reasons for ‘chur'liy' would He not
so much in the inrllvfdual's need,

but rather. in the individual himself

and the situation.

Roger quoted Miss liaml as say-
ing in answer to a similar ques-
tion that she would help :1 beggar...
if (i) I could afford it, and (2)1f'l
know rmthlug evil about the mun.’

The question of the iruiiyiriual’s
‘Oilllgufimr’ to society, was one of
the major points of t'orrterulou dur-
ing the evening.

Mr. Grimes made an important
Clarification when he asserted that
he hurl no objection to helping the
individual bot-rune pr‘utluciiyu and
agreed ihuf murmured 'lrnrrd-uul’us-
sistarrr'u was not the l\lllil of wellur‘e
did he would approve.

Another rumor inure uf t-mrrcutiuu
was uvr-r' ‘larsnex—fmre' capitalism.
This pur'liwulm issue was in turn
stressed by the audience in the
quesirrmlul; period that followed.

Roger Lee had asserted that it
would be lumi'uhlu in him in return
to ‘luizrl lruxxuz—fuir'c r‘upitalrsui’
and although be qualified his stale-
mem to the effect that the U. S. had
never sewn tour] lumber-fairs, m-
dr'r'afevl ilurt the 111th century U.S.
was 'uu Uli‘tliiui'll.’

The Lois-.ez-loirc Ideal

In answer to a question by Dr.
liel'gur', Huger explained that his
‘idcal' ul theluisscr-f'uii'e(:apiiallsl

,aliyurru, J, J. Hill, who, Roger us-
ser'ted, was not, like Rockefeller,

'rm-uurse lil fruit-ml aid‘ (if the 100
other illnulcicr's and industrialists.

Dr. Kendall, although not a mum-
bur' of the panel, rundc his [tl'GSGllt'U

answer session lolluwfng the dis—
Cilssiuir. lie repeatedly returned lu
the filth century version of luisscz-
fairs, and challenged its use as an
‘ideul' in any sense,

Some of the less controversial but
nonetheless significant issues
brought forward during the discus-
Slull involved politics and even a
little philosophy,

Early in the panel, Mr. Grimes
had pointed out the apparent para-
dox in the fact that businessmen
whom one would expect to be sup-
porters of Ayn Rand, rejected her
views as not a 'sound statement of
Conservative phllusophy.’ Mr.

Grimes also pointed out that Miss
Hand’s 'new intellectualfsm’ was
coolly received in academic circles.

Tire poliiir'al aspects were im-
mediately picked up by Roger Lee
who stated that Conservatism was
'foo concerned with the innate de-
pravity of man.’ ile also pointed out
that many businessmen would not
approve her philosophy because of
her attacks on what she calls ‘luot-
er‘s.’

linsleuirig to add [but he was not
making accusations against the ill-
r'emul' .'\lr‘. Grimes quoted, he gave
‘subsitly r‘lrzlser’s‘ as an oxnruplc of
the ‘luotcrs' to whom Miss Rand
referred.

Luster added that the 'i‘lght wing’
was source of the most bitter ai~
tar-ks on Ayn liauti because their
religious orientation was in direct
cunl'llr'i With the program she pre-
souls.

Mr. Grimes clarified his inter-
ests were not in her position on the
left or right, but rather lulier'lsland’
in terms of a philosophy of govern-
mental action.

Back in Philosophy

Philosophy had been the starting
point of the panel discussion al-
though it was rapidly obscured.
ltugor' initially responded to the
question of wiry Oleecllvisni was
popular by saying that lie andmhcr's.
were ‘dlssntisffcrl' with the doc-
ir'incs that were put forth in the
past.

The trend of philosophy, he felt,
was toward an assertion lhul ‘muu
could know nothing through l'efiﬁull,
yet reason was the only means
rfrmrlfled enough for man folulluw.”

Ulijci’llillslll, however, he us-
SGI‘IL‘il, was if ‘i'eirrslrllmeui of the
essential dignity of rnan.’

llir'. Grimes indicated throughout
the discussion that his objections
and those of Dr. Berger, were not
in a philosophy that concer'uodltscif
with man's self-fulfillment, rather
at the program that Ayn liaud pro-
souls as a meansio self-fulfillment,

It is highly doubtful that the panel
changed any views on thephiiusuphy
of Objectivism. Perhaps it stimu-
lated some serious thought. The
final Judgment remains iothc future.
