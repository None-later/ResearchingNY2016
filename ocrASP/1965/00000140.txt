' o thletic'sgla t Wednesdaynight that‘We feel'should
' be of interest-to everyjsiaorts fan. The experience.'We ‘
e' ’ refs E "ng‘to is the seasonal sports banquetfof the

_ _ At this "banquet we saw State sports at theirbest.

‘ I This may sound :funny because. who thinks of a‘ban-
duet asbeing an intrinsic attribute of athletics? We
now do; ,We saw the sincerity and pride of coaches
praising their athletes, the humility of the athletes
receiving their-awards. and the exuberance with which
the members of ‘the different teamsnpplauded'their
peers. What more can athletics teach an individual? ~ ,. a ‘

'OVer and over again 'the coaches told of‘the hard 5-9 J-t  m r " a
work, patience and desire, their players put forth

_ during the year. And yet we never grew tired of it.

We felt proud to be associated with a group of indi-
viduals who know what it is to work for something
other than the highly inadequate coverage of a college

"newspaper or for the appreciation of fellow students.

We never kidded ourselves into believing this was
ever their moment. -

Emotion Filled

We saw an emotional and tear—filled Joe Garcia bid
a fond farewall to a player whom he had coached for
three years. We felt a lump in our throat, too.

We watched an intense Tom Robinson extolhisfrosh
runners. using the same terms that coaches used to
describe him with when he was Albany’s greatesthar-
rier only ayear ago. I

We saw Bill Schieffelin convey his deep frustration
during the past frosh soccer season. He showed im-
mense pride in his players, and from the skills and
attitudes we know the freshman learned from him
during the season, we can easily call to mind an old
adage: “Achievement is not the primary function of
athletics.”

“Spud” Kruzan and Keith Munsey provided the en—
tertainment for the evening, epitomizing the buoyancy
of the affair.

To the award winners -— Udo Guddat. soccer; Paul
Durbin, cross-country; Mike Atwell and Don Beevers.
frosh cross-country; and Harold Toretszky. frosh
soccer - our most sincere congratulations.

Dislike Selections

The sports department should like to voice its dis—
satisfaction with the AMIA football all-star selections
as made by the team captains last week.

Since it was the captains doing the choosing, we
cannot see how they arrived at some of the choices
they did. There are certain players on the team we
feel don’t belong there; discretion rules out naming
these players. However, it is our opinion that such
players as Trinity’s Charlie Hickey, Tower’s Sal Vil—
la, and Potter’s Len Haybrook were among the out-
standing players in the league and yet overlooked in
the balloting.

Trinity, in particular, was hard hit; APA, which
was tied by Trinity for second place, had eight men
on the starting team — Trinity had none.

Central Council Resolution Supports

Siena’s Father Bonaventure-nﬂiBrien 

Shortly after election
day, the news of Father
Bonaventure O’Brien’s or-
ders to remain on campus
at Siena College became
public. Three colleges in
the Albany area have joined
together in support of
Father Bonaventure.

The College of Saint Rose made
a statement through its StudentSen-
ate favoring the work of Father
Bonaventure and praising the efforts
of the Siena Student Senate in behalf
of their instructor. lnthe statement,
the Senate urged the students of St.
Rose to examine the situation, and
urged the faculty to “continue to
provide Christian leadership.”

The students of Siena initiated the
action and requested support for
their proposed plans. They had hoped
to organize demonstrations, and had
published a leaflet stating their po-
sition and feelings toward the action
of the diocesan biearchy.

At the Central Council meeting of
November ll), the question of sup-
port of the actions of Siena students
and the manner in which we might
extend support was debated. Presi-
dent Thompson stated that he had
been to Siena and had discussed the
situation.

Princip'e

Dr. Rosenbach suggested that the
Council extend support of the prin-
ciples behind the action taken, but
not necessarily support the action
itself. Then the question of a public
institution interfering in the internal
affairs of a religious organization
was debated.

it is not necessarily the right of
this institution to question actions
taken by the Catholic Church Ad-
ministrallon in this or any other
question. At lbo same time the stu-
dents and faculty members of Con-
tral Council felt some statement
should be made on this matter.

The students of Siena had stated

in their leaﬂet that “a man should
not be removed from social action
since the principles are Christian
in nature. Council agreed on this
point, but disagreed on what the
nature of its statement should be.

Statement

Several suggestions were sub-
mitted for the Council's approval.
Finally the suggestion of Dean Brown
was accepted as the best possible
wording for our sentiments. The
resolution said both that it approved
of the action of Father O’Brien and
that it supported the spirit of Si-
ena’s actions.

The statement submitted for pub-
lication is as follows: "The mem-

bers of the Central Council of the
State University of New York at
Albany accord respect and admira-
tion for the spirit and maturity with
which the Siena Student Senate has
stated its convictions toward hu-
manitarian concerns.

“We support the contention that
each man must be free within self
imposed limitations to fulfill his
personal commitment to others in
a manner consistent with his beliefs.

The following night, interested
students gathered at the “Golden
Eye” to hear people speak on the
topic of Father Bonaventure's or-
ders. Representatives for the three
colleges were present.

«VOL. LI, NO. 41

   

Madame Catherine Wolkonsky of Albany State’s De-
partment of Slavic Languages has been offered an addi-
tional one year extension of her tenure. Madame Wol-
konsky will be 72 before the end of this year. The policy
of the State University ordinarily precludedpersons over
70 from full time teaching assignments.

Late last year, the local.

University Council votedto
allow Madame Wolkonsky
to remain a full time teach-

er for this year.

Madame Wolkonsky, a native of
Russia, is a world famous authority
on the Russian language. She joined
this faculty in 1963.

Book on Roots

She is co-author ofabook entitled
"A Dictionary of Russian Roots."
This work is widely considered tobe
a definitive study of the structure of
the Russian language.

Madame Wolkonsky has been ac-
tive in assisting the research of
many scholars of the Russian lan-
guage. A graduate student currently
studying here claims that he cannot
find a recent book whichdoes not in-
clude a lengthy acknowledgment of
thanks to Madame Wolkonsky.

Drive to Support Foster Child to Begin

For the third year, the ASP is
asking University students to con-
tribute to the support of its Colum-
bian foster child, Graciala Garcia.
The drive will commence Monday
and will continue until Christmas

 

Graciela Gorcla
 ASP Foster Child

recess.

Graciala Garcia has been the fos-
ter child of the ASP since January
1964. The ASP is supporting Gra-
clala under the Foster Parents Plan.
This is an organization with inter-
national headquarters in New York
City.

Plan Moro Direct

The plan differs from the con-
ventional form of charity because
it is more direct and personal. Each
month the sponsor and the child
exchange letters through PLAN
headquarters. Here the letters are
translated, but both the original and
the translation are sent to the spon-
sor and the child. Graciala'sleiiers
are published in the ASP. Her father
is a carpenter who earns $30 a
month. This barely insets the cost
of the family's necessities. The
foster child receives $15 a month
to cover the cost of medical care,
household equipment, counseling,
and guidance. Clothing is sent at
regular intervals.

Since adoption by the ASP, Gra-
clala has grown from an under-
nourished to a healthy child. The

contributions of the Foster Parents

Plan have not only improved the
living conditions of the family, but
have also enabled Graciela to re-
ceive an education. In her monthly
letters, Graciela is very enthusias-
tic about school.

Collections for the foster child
will take place in the Peristyies
from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Also, can-
tribulions may be given to any News
Board member or brought to the
Publications Office, Room 5, Bru-
bacher.

GOLDEN EYE

One of Albany State's rare mod-
ern jazz coucerls will take place at
the Golden Eye lonighi. The Greg
l’rucuplu Quintet will perform. The
quintet consists of Procopio on the
flute and tenor sax, his brother,
Joe Procopio on the alto, John Rit-
chie on piano, Bob Verdgeline on
drums, and Jack LaGalta on bass
and guitar.

The tunes they will play include
“A Night in Tunisia,” “Summer-
time,” “Bug's Groove," “Moan-
in’," and "Autumn Leaves."

There will be a 255’ admission
charge tonight.

working on the development of the
program in Russian. When she or-
rived here, there were only three
courses in Russian.

There is now a minor andamajor
in Russian. By the end of the year
the Masters’ degree program lsex-
pected to be completed. Two addi-
tional professors will be added to
teach Russian in the department.

Madame Wolkonsky teaches Rus-
sian 139 A and B in the Comparative
Literature department. This course
covers the works of Tolstoy and
Dostoevsky. Last semester many
students, thinking that it would be
her last semester teaching, signed
up for the course. The largest room
of the Modern Language Annex had.
students standing and sitting on
window sills.
