no the Viet, iianiest Want (in Victory-

The"views expressed inthepublic and

Nam situation indicate the stupidity to“:
wards the Soviet Union that often takes
the place of elementary understandings.

The actions of the Chinese in evacua-
ting several cities in southern China
have indicated to us that the Chinese be-
lieve that America is determined in its
South Viet Nam policy.

The American scene has been filled
with students and non-students protesting
our presence in South Viet Nam. The
same streets have been filled with the
members of Hell’s Angels andother true
patriots, like Richard Nixon,,who want us
to bomb every city. they think would be
better if it were in ruins.

The Chinese and the Soviets have known
for many years that their efforts to sub-
vert America haye been and continue to
bit ovcsi‘wvlzié‘xal‘néiful'iulcc. Tl}: laukul‘
sd'ccess: of rCommuni‘st».moiIements in
America has been Startling.

Still we have the members of the right
wing who, failing to find actual Com-
munists, seek what to them is the next
best thing: thinkers, people seeking
change, and fluoridaters of water.

The efforts of the neo-genius super-
patriotiwho tells Lyndon Johnson and the
other experts in foreign policy that they
do not know how to conduct a war should
remain fruitless. The only effects these
misguided efforts has had is to prepare
the Chinese for attacks that do not seem
to be in the cards.

The position of America in Viet Nam
is tenuous. There is no government to
speak of. What government there is has

virtually no support Irom the people of

professioniil‘ press regarding ,thevy‘iet‘jYiet Nam. Congressmhas notnldeclared a

bias, yet men are dying. . .

There are clear indications that ninety
percent of all Viet Cong weapons have
been captured from Americans and South
Viet Namese. There is not sufficientevi-
dence to assume that the average Viet
Cong trooper is a Communist. The lead-
are certainly appear to be Communists,
but our policy has left the people seeking
change no. place to go except to the Viet
Cong side.

The U.S. has created a situation. The
government of. South Viet Nam is not in-
terested in the reforms that the people
have been after since the 1940's. Our
support of this government only continues
to delay the reforms that could win the
support of the people.

This does not mean that we oppose
supporting thej troops presently in Viet
Nam} This does mean that we will oppose
the eventual further increase of troops
there.

We do say that we have created a some-
what incredible situation in which the
purposes and aspirations of the South Viet
Namese people cannot be met by the
achievement of our goals.

We feel that the policy being followed
is full of errors, but that this policy is
better than a retreat.

Perhaps we could be enthusiastic if
there were any indication that what’s-
his-name, our premiere over there,
is interested in land or tax reform, or
if there is any real break through in
guerilla warfare, or if there is any way
to know which natives are with us and
which are paying lip service,

‘Chandaiier'

To the Editors:

In regards to the new "chande-
lier" in the Flag Room of the Dutch
Quadrangle- Before we go any fur-
ther, it is of absolute necessity to
apologize for usingthe term chande-
lier so loosely. We hope that we
have not offended the manufacturers
of real chandeliers or the proud

' owners of anique ones.

A year ago the University gave us
sand dunes but neglected to give us
camels to travel across them. We
were al'so«g'lven a lake which was
put off limits..

Now we’ve been given a jungle,
suspended between ceiling and floor
amidst the flags. Our non functional
jungle is truly a modernistic one,
for it has aspotllght shiningbrightly
amidst the weeds.

We would like to ask what the
University will give us next. We’d
like to suggest a range of mountains
and some waterfalls. They'd be as
functional as lakes and jungles and
they would look nicer.

Defends Directors

To the Editor; M

This letter is in response to your
editorial of November 16, entitled
“Role of Director, Students."

l have no authority to comment on
specifics concerning dorm dues
themselves. However, in regard to
the stated situation, I believe that
it is unfair to sterotype all our
residence hall directors as “dicta-
tors” solely on the basis of the
actions of one in particular.

In your article, reference was
also made to the attitude of the per-
son who regarded the freshman dia-
betic as a “burden on everyone
around her." Of course this attitude
is wrong; however, I cannot believe
that this attitude is taken by any
residence director.

The statement itself was probably
taken out of context, and, standing
alone, has no real meaning.

Furthermore, you state that a
level of professionallty should be
expected in the personalities of our
directors. This fact is .i'eintlveiy
true, but might load the following:
One should not be so professional
that he or she cannot also under-
stand a student's situation or prob-
lem, whatever that may be. The
ideal director serves a dual role
as an adviser, and even more im-
portant, as a friend.

The directors that l have met and
known personally have possessed
these fine qualities which make them
such valuable assets to our college
soalety. They should be commended
for their williiigiiassiowork withus.

When you say that residents are
“treated as though they are docile

fools," upon what do you base your
case? Perhaps the director does not
always have the last word, but his
word is good, and should not go un-
heeded.

Students who feel mistreated must
realize that the director‘s concern
lies with promoting the general good
for everycine. You say to bring our
complaints to someone responsible.
Where can you find someone more
responsible and knowledgeable of
this situation?

If a student disagrees with a
warning or reprimand given by his
director, it is up to him to sit down
and talk over the situation with his
respective director.

Very little good will be accom-
plished .by taking the matter else-
where to someone, who is unfamiliar
with it.

To summarize, let me say that I
think you are wrong in your attitude,
and that you have made some de-
grading statements without any
grounds for doing so.

Hasty Generalization

To the Editor:

We have become increasingly dis-
turbed by the attitude taken by the
editors of the ASP toward the Resi-
dence Hall‘Dlrectors of the Univer-
sity. Anyone Who has taken acourse
in freshmen Logic would recognize
your editorial as an example of a
hasty generalization.

There are eleven Residence Hall
Directors associated with the Uni-
verslty, two of whom have been
cited as exemplifying irresponsi-
bility towards their residents. It is
unfortunate that the remaining nine
will also bear the brunt of your
lnsinuatlons.

Residence Hall Directors are in-
dividuals. The actions of several of
these have been used to maliciously
influence the attitudes of residents
of all the halls.

Directors have the responsibility
for the safety and well belngofthcir
residents. Their authority has been
refuted. The respect they deserve
has been negated. Your editorial has
placed the directors on the defen-
sive. We do not feel allihe directors
should be placed in this position.

Furthermore, we do not agree
with the editors of the ASP Hun
students are "docile fools.” I! the
students have n legitimate rom-
plant they will know enough to con—
sull their directors.

v 1 Th Christianhos noth-‘
ing tolose and everything
to. gain by replacing lrrel-'
cranes” and hostility with
man snd'encounter."

This clings to the 20th century
Christian: ksynotod the final speech
of the “histories at Mid-Century"
Symposium Monday night. Dr. Yar-
lslsv Pelican, Professor of Ec-
clesiastical History at Yale Unl-
verslty, spoke before a wall-filled
Page Hall on “The Religious Up-
heavsl."  ' 

Although Dr. Pellkan warned that
"dialog" was becoming an ex-
tremely cliched word," it was the
key to many of the changes taking
place in today's religious areas. it.
is tied in closely with “a new con-
corn for ecumenical encounter."

Dr. Pelikan cited three different
types ofudlalog which arehavlng
their effect on the church today.
The first Was "dialog with the
world.” In the past, the church has
been characterized not by “free,
creative, and'courageous love," but
by withdrawal, irrelevance and an.
lipsthy toward the world.

(smell Professor
To lecture Today

Dr. Lamont ’Cole, Chalrman of
the Section on Ecology and Syste-
matics 'of the Division of Biological
Sciences at Cornell University, will
discuss "Man's Ecosystem" today
in Draper 349.

It is the study of man's history
in a functional way both during pre-
historic times as well as more re-
cent epochs in which civilization
and complex social organizations
arise. The physical effects of the
policies and practices of present
man are also examined,

Dr. Cole received his B.S. in
physics at the University of Chi-
cago, his M.S. in Biology at Uni-
versity of Utah and his Ph.D. in
zoology at the University of Chicago.

In 1948 he joined the faculty at
Cornell University as an assistant
professor of zoology. in 1964 he
was made chalrman of the Depart-
ment of Zoology.

Dr. Cole has published over sev-
enty papers in the field of ecology.

He is also a member of thirteen
national honorary societies includ-
ing Sigma Xi, Phi Sigma and the
American Society of Zoologists.

The result of the concentration -‘-‘

of the church upon itself has been
paralysis and slug-nation. Dr. Pell-
ksn emphasized that if the church
is to continue to be a potent force,
it must become relevant to the life
of the world.

“The most creative periodsoftho
church’s intellectual life came in
listening to the voice of the world."

The second kind of dialog is
"dialog within Christendom." This
is immensely important, he said,
because "relevance to the world
without unity of the church is a
travesty." -

As the churches work together
in relating to the world, the ele-
ments of distinction become more
and more unimportant. The prin-
ciple sources of this ecumenical
spirit are young churches in the
mission fields, students, and the
social and political crises of the

20th century which point up the

crying need. for social service and
action.

Dr. Pellkan stressed that dialog
must resume not only among Chris-
tlansand Jews, but amongall mono-
thclstic religions. I

The flnal kind of dialog which he
cltad was "dialog with the past."
Thishs saw as a "rediscovery of
the variety and richness of the in-
tellectual and liturgical past of the
church." "'

A serious study of the history and
writings of the.church and its early
theologians would give new meaning
to present day studies of theology.

Dr. Pellkan expressed the fear,
however, that all this dialog might
be "too little and too late." The
church has missed many valuable
opportunities in the recent past,
opportunities which will not come
again.

"But," he concluded, "if we take
the dialog seriously, we have nothing
to lose but our chains."

Atheism

Several questions were raised at
the close of Dr. Pelikan's speech.
One asked for his evaluation of the
recent wave of atheism and “God
is dead, but that’s all right" the-
ology.

He answered that it was "more

Christian Scientist to Speak

"Awakening to Nowness of Life"
is the title of a‘publlc lecture to be
held today. The lecture ’is being
sponsored by The Christian Science
Organization.

Florence C. Southwell, C.S.B., a
recognized teacher and practitioner
of Christian Science from Orlando;
Florida, will be the speaker. Mrs.
Southwell was formerly assistant
manager of a Florida business firm,

significant as a symptom than as 1
a phenomenon." He attributed it to i

a loss of meaning and bewilderment
within the individual. He felt that
most of the anti-church sentiments
come from a group “not engaged in
disciplined study that would entitle
them to make these claims."

He added that “most of the valid
points” of today’s theology are made
by men who study.

students to help. Presently, there
are eight or nine University men
, attending these Wednesday night
sessions. But because of the large
‘ number of children partaking in the
project, more help is needed. I
Two groups on campus have taken
an active part in lhls projecl.Theso
groups are Adams House consisting
of Mike Castle, Joe Colles, Jim
Crego, Dave leaf, John Kellller,
Mike Bligh and Paul Butter-field
and Theta Xi Omega with John Rod-

and Ken thtle. ‘
Dick Donovan and Jack Duffyhsve
contributed their time and efforts
in the program. However, more
University men are needed to work
with small groups of children in the
various activities of the project.
Joseph Silvey and Nail Brown
have asked that those men inter-
ested in joining Project Helpmste
