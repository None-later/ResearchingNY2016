team.

Disrupt Ottenso Patterns
Commenting further, “Doc”
stated that, "We will have to disrupt
the opponents’ offensive patterns.
We won’t be getting too many l'e-
bounds so we’ll have to capitalize
on their mistakes and try to fast

than we did."

Not Yet Consistent
As for how the team has looked
so far, Sauol's added: "We're at
almost 100% efficiency — closest to
1009i than any other team at this
time. But we're not yet consistent
for we haven’t played together much.
It \vilibe extl'eillelydltficult to match

last year's Iii-U record."
The first gallle for the cagel‘s is
tomorrow night with Siena at home.
All home games are played at the

of the Goobers in a match before
the vacation.

Potter topped the previously un-
beaten Goobers by 108 pins, with
games of 890, 903, 889. Goobers
had 868, 857, 854.
