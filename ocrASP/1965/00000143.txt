University Offers
Computer Course
Next Semester

An introductory course in com-
puter science will he offered for
the first time at the Universitydur-
ins the spring....semsslent..i3t Dz
,Reilly, Jr‘.’,‘associate ‘professortand
director .oftthe Computer center,
will be the instructor.

Reilly and his staff have been de-
veloping 'a sequence of courses in
-computer scienceuvhlch will_bg_in-
.cluded seen cadmiumst

the future the finstitutlon will offer

a minoriieldelh the subject, to be
‘ followed with a major field offering.

The introductory course will be
taught at the University’stemporary
gcomputer center located in the Air
Force Reserve Center on North
Main Avenue in Albany. Plans for
the new campustnclude development
-of a large computing center to be
‘ ready in 1007.

Stressed in the course outline is
the view that a student does not
need exceptional mathematical tal-
ent; rather, he should have strong
logical reasoning ability. The role
of the computer as a giant calcu-
lator will be subordinated to its
power as a facile manipulator of
information.

Student homework problems will
be processed at the center.

Announcement of the course has
met with an enthusiastic response
frotn students. Almost every field
of study at the University is repre-
sented by students already enrolled
in the three-credit course open to
all umlergraduatas.
