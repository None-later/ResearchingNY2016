Tickets for the production, ac-
cording to Ross Stephen, adapter-
director, are available on a reserved
‘basis from the State University
Theatre box office, Richardson 280,
for $1.50 or student tax.

The show, which constitutes the
second major production in the State
University Theatre's 1965-1966
season, is a chamber theatre pres-
entation: that is, the Work tobe per-
formed is not a play, but a piece of
narrative fiction, in this case, a
novel.

Chamber Theatre

Stephen who is assisted on the
“Scandal” by Diane Somerville,
first introduced chamber theatre
to Albany at the spring English
eventing with the presentation of two
short stories. The adaptation from
the highly acclaimed novel which is
being used in the present production
was done by Stephen himself; as with
all chamber theatre, the most strik-
ing innovation is that ofthe narrator
who serves the function of the erst-
while reader.

His continual presence on stage
represents the ongoing stream of
the author’s commentary, providing
the necessary background informa-
tion as well as transition and sense
of unity. The technique alloWs full
advantage to be taken of all avail-
able theatrical devices without sac-
rificing the narrative elements, thus
combining, in essence, the best of
both worlds.

A Family
The novel itself deals witii'~the

Wap‘shots, considered by many to

be among the first families of Amer-

ican literature. The truth, however,

is that the Wapshot family, in a

The cast, owing to the range and
scope of the work to be treated, is
perforce quite large: in all, ninety- »

two personages appear on stage,
ranging in magnitude from six-line
- or even mute — cameos to the
narrator himself, whose lines ac-
count for approximately one-half
of the entire script. The actors
number nine, as do their i‘eminln‘e
counterparts, and multiple casting,
an absolute necessity, has given
some as many as nine rob-s,

Ninc Roles

She leads the rest n: ‘ . last in

sheer number of roles played: they

singer, through a blind woman,toan
~ old lady who knits socks for astro-'

mots. Ch‘ariea Helneman, witheight
roles, runs her a close second; his
portrayals include the late Leander
Wapshot and an absent-minded but
brilliant scientist. _

" Bruce Tiffany, who handles seven

'roles himself, appears with Miss

Greene as Mr. and Mrs. Cranston,
who with Coverly and Betsey are
the guests of Mr. and Mrs. Brinkley,
played by Ellis Kaufman and Diane
Somervllie. Mr. Kaufman completes
his repertoire as an equerry and
Norman Johnson, lionora’s attorney.
Miss Somerville, in addition, does
duty as a barmaid and a cleaning
woman.

Perhaps more than any othercast
member, veteran Charles Bartlett
manages to parlay several incon-
sequential appearances — six, to be
exact — into some superb acting.
His performance as Joe Burner, :1
passenger on a plane which also
carries Coverly, a cab driver, and
a suave and oily jewelry-store clerk,
fall just short of walking away with
the show.

Other Roies
Ronald Brew, who portrays Me-
lissa’s lover, also enacts her doctor
and a blind man. Early in the show
Coverly (otherwise known as Peter
Brooks) is drowned as Mr. Spof-

ford, and still later sold as Ivan.

 

Betsey’s face likewise is seer;-

severai times as Florence Kaern
portrays the Shakespearean actress
Lottie Beecham and Mrs, Williams,
while her brother-in-ilw, Moses,
appears (through Bill Mayer) under
the guise of the aged Mr. Sturgis
and an Italian named Paolo.

Janice Newmark turns in her per-
formances as the orlon-happy Mrs.
Sheffield, a stewardess, and Laura
Hilllston, a vicious Proxmire Manor
socialite, while Alexandra Sadori
(Melissa) is seen as a blind woman
and Mrs. Bretaigne.

Jane Mandel draws with consum-
mate artistry a somewhat eerie por-
trait of the manners and mores of
the Deep South as Betsey'sdivorcee
sister, Caroline, filling also a con-
siderably different role as the dis-
solute Widow \Viliston. Dahlia Low-
enstein sees duty as Maggie, lion-
ora's maid, and Emiie's widowed
mother, Mrs. Cranmer.

Rehearsals for the show began in

mid-October and were conducted _

along traditional lines. One of the
problems which arose- anti often
does in the Studio Theatre — lay
in nrcustoming the actors to havle
the audience \‘ll‘lllt’illy “on their
laps.” This difficulty, along with
several others, have been sur-
mounted, and all aspects of thep o-
duction have been integrated into a
cohesive whole for tomorrow night’s
premiere.

SLIDES CONTRAST BLACK-WHITE GRAY UNLOCALIZED SET

A set of black velours hung with
four white frames will set the stage
tomorrow night for the premiere of
John Cheever’s “The \VapshotScan-
dal.” Before them stand several
angular, black-and-white platforms,
cantilevered to give the appearance
of floating in mid-air, and a mush-
room-like table and three stools —
all in the same somber colors -
complete the scene.

Designed by Mr. Robert J. Don-

'eily, technical director of the State

University Theatre, the set is pur-
posely unlocalized in order that it
may be dressed to represent a
variety of locales. The simplicity

.of» the set, added to its cold and

stark colors, lend themselves well
to the principles of space staging
which Donnelly has . sed, and serve
to emphasize the universality of the
story which unfolds upon it.

Set

The platforms, which include a
triangle, four stairs and a long,
runway-type platform, are done
completely in gray, white anti black;
they are complimented by two large
white screens, hung on either side
of the proscenium arch.

On these will be shown a series
of slides illustrating int-ale anti the
like. Numbering seventy-two, the
slides, together with set- and hand-
props, provide all the localization
in the show.

Costumes, under Sue Raynor,
graduate assistant in costuming,
have been planned according to the
same principles as the set. Aided
by ilarbara Smith, Miss Raynor has
amassed a set oi costumes done en-
tirely in the omnipresent white and
black.

than emphasize the inuinres.
because of the simplicity of the
set, a great nnmy bond and set-
props are used in the play. A
Properties list numbering just short
3f one hundred has been a major
source of headaches for Florence
Kaem and Diane Somerville (who
are both, in addition, cast mom-
bors) as they tracked down articles

as diverse as a curling iron, an
antique mandolin and a sack of
live kittens.

Sound likewise is of the utmost
importance to the action, and Vic-
toria Frances and Betty Jane Wil-
cox, under the supervision of Jay
Deanahan, have undertaken the re-
cording of Voices, trains and thun-
der.

Lighting
Another cast member serving on
the technical crew is Jim Lobdeli,

chief electrician. Aided by Blanche
Mironer and Donna Little, his was
the task. of hanging, focusing, and
gelling all, the lighting instruments
to be used in such a way‘ as to take
fullest advantage of the intimacy -
and, sometimes, limited ficilities -
of the Studio Theatre. Several spe-
cial effects, including asiihouette of
several actors, was achieved with-
practice. .

In keeping with the unconventional
nature of the work itself (for itcan-

not properly be referred to as a
play), unorthodox use has been made
of several of the physical aspects
of the theatre: one such use con-
cerns the aforementioned screens.
Another lies in exits and entrances
made by several of the actors.

Set Construction
One of the most remarkable things
about the set and the technical work
which went into its construction,
and will continue, throughout the
run, to go on backstage, according

to one bystander (male) was that it
had been done mainly by “a bunch
of girls!"

such is indeed the case, since
the stagecraft class, Speech 18,
which carries compulsory work on
all productions of the State Unl-
verslty Theatre, is composed en-
tirely of girls — nine in all - who
have received their baptism of
greasepaint and glue both on the
current production and the recent
performances of "Of Mice and

Men.”
