Forum of Politics to Sponsor

Model U.N. Security Council

Forum of Politics will hold its
tenth annual Model United Nations
Security Council for area high
schools today in Bruhacher Lower
Lounge. The high schools will each
represent a country Oil the Secur-
ity Council and will represent the
views of that country on the issues
raised during the session.

Each school sends a delegation
of four to eight members, one of
whom is designated as the country's
representative, while the others try
to negotiate and confer with the other
delegations in order to achieve de-
feat or passage of a resolution.

Resolutions
This year the resolutions will be
on the Dominican Republic and Rho-
deals. The Dominican Republic
resolution was introduced originally
iii, “mu” be sun by Uruguay and states that United
Nations' members should refrain

from force against the political lll-
dependence of any state.

Tile Rhodesian resolution was dis-
cussed in the United Nations before
Rhodesia declared itself inde-
pendent. It requested that the Uni-
ted Kingdom not allow the minority
government to be declared.

Due to recent developments this
resolution will probably be radically
amended during the conference.

Schools Represented

The schools attending the confer-
ence and the country they will rcp-
ressnt are Milne-France; Albany
High-United Kingdom; PhllipSchuy-
ler-U r u g u a y; Gullderlund-USSR;

pating are Barbara ’l‘nnde, Secretary
General; Ken Fuclismnn, president
of the Security Council; Jim Econo-
mides, parliamentarian; and Harold
Lynne, critic. Also, Kathy Geratz,
llownrd Stein, Ami Thoungton, Don-
nn Gavel and Linda Cannova will
advise the delegations.

Fuchsmnn, president of Forum of
Politics, said that thepurpose ofthls
conference Is “to familiarize the
students with the processes and
functions of the United Nations and
by representing individual countries
to see the role of the United Nations
in world politics.“ .
