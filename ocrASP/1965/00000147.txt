Basis for “Representation
With the issue of voluntary student tax
looming large over student «government,
the question of who.,ishould',be"repre-
sented in student government hasarisen.
Should students who do" not-pay} student
tax be able to vote..in STALelections.
We feel that the answer to this ques-
tion is obvious, onlystudents who pay
student tax shouldubegnfranchised.
Anyone who does ,elong to an or—
ganization should not time a voice in it.
This is true in every IStudent Associa-
tion organization, why should it-not be
true for the Student Association itself?
One argument for having these non—
paying students eligible to vote'is that
student government sets policy that af—
fects the whole student body. '
This argument can easily be refute
with the example of the United States

 

 

‘ government. The ‘government makes laws

that affect its population but only the
citizens vote .for its representatives.

Student Association is the government
of the student body and, in a sense.
those students who pay student tax are
its citizens.

Another problem involving represen—
tation is in the organization of Student
Associations. Mostpeople agree thatonly
members of SA should be allowed to par—
ticipate in campus activities.

However, what about the sororities and
fraternities on campus? Should they make
it mandatory for their members to pay
student tax? The ad hoc committee
studying the problem ‘of student tax feel
they should and have asked the Greeks
to enforce this rule.

We agree with their action. Since

lioperaiion Needed

At a press conference of several
weeks ago, Colonel Walter Tisdale, as—
sistant to the President for plant plan-
ning, reported some interesting infor—
mation.

Tisdale debunked the commonly ac~
cepted view that the top' soil of the Al-
bany Country Club was plowed under
when the place was levelled. The top
soil was scrapped off and placed in a
“bank.”

A more important and more immed-
iate point was made regarding the land—
scaping of the areas around the Dutch
quad.

The first attempt at growing grass
was a total failure. The landscaping, for
this reason, was not accepted. The con~
tractor has now tried a second time. if
this try is not a success, the University
has a legal right to require a third try.

Tisdale stated that the University is
losing its moral right to ask for a third
try and is losing its legal right to ask
for this additional attempt.

The reason for this state of affairs
is the treatment of the grounds by the
students. if the regulations regarding
not walking on the grass and not-yet—
grass are not observed, the University
will be in a poor position if the Univer—
sity attempts to get the contractor to
try yet again. A little cooperation is in
order.

This is a good reason for having an FSA. But at the

the operations of this FSA as an evasion of their

The Albany State FSA has been a success in evading
‘ the limitations the State has attempted to set down by
the state’s constant refusal of money for cerinin,

specific budget requests.

The unfortunate part of the FSA is that it has been
the brainchild of the administration. It has for too limp,~
been considered a sacred fief, operated by loyal

seneschals.

This attitude has caused the people in charge of ihe
FSA to react against any and all questions or Criticisms

regarding FSA.

No one has the right to say that any one thing should

be above question.

The students of this campus and the faculty and shit
provide every cent of the income of the FSA. The only
possible exception is any interest accrued by tho

accounts of the FSA.

These same students, faculty and staff have a fairly
good reason to expect that the management of the i"\‘.\
is based on more than a few deans and the business

manager of the college.

The addition of a few students who can have no my

Many FSA have students who vote if they :iri- ‘31.

Solution to Winning Vietnam War

by D. GordonUpham

Many critics of the administra—
tion have concentrated their attacks
upon the methods used to fight the
Viei Cong in South Vietnam. Not all
of their plans are as absurd as
Goldwater's plan to use atomic wea-
pons to defoilaie the jungles hiding
the trails used by North Vietna-
mese infiltrators.

Some cities have advocated the
bombing of Communist China, as-
peciniiy the infant atomic facilities.
This would have little relevance to
the outcome of the war in South
Vietnam, since China gives very
little, if any, direct aid to the Viet
Cong.

’l‘he nld which goes from China
to Norili Vietnam is rarely sent
down to South Vietnam. Only re-
cently have weapons produced in
China been used by the North Vici-
Iinincse in South Vietnam 'l‘o bomb
Clilnn because of these few weapons
would be fully. Adhering to this line
of reasoning would require the Uni-
tori States to bomb Russia, Czecho-
slovakia, and other satellite coun-
tries.

Bombing Hanoi Unllkoiy

Another frequent suggestion is to
heavily bomb the mnjor cities, in-
dustries, ports, and dams in North

this is unlikely. I

REHEARSALS FOR "The Wopshet Scandal" continued right up
the last minute as players awaited the opening night, Wednesday,
December 8.

Acting Group Defines
Organisation Purpose

The following is a statement by the Ars Antiqua So—
ciety describing the organization.

“We of the Ars Antiqua Society are one of many per—
forming arts groups dedicated to offering the public
representatives of the rich store of man’s cultural en-
deavor. We are proud that in a small way Ars Antiqua
can offer employment in their chosen field to artists
in a broad variety of arts—dancers, singers, writers,
instrumentalists and actors.

Expanded Schedule

“We are proud, too, of our expanded, statewide
schedule of performances with the magnificent support
of the New York State Council on the Arts under its
Touring Program. Finally, we are proud that we have
been endorsed by The Council to bring versions of our
productions to the schools.

“It is the Arts Council’s hope to foster in youth that
broader view, that finer judgment, and that graceful
balance which alone a working familiarity with the arts
and humanities can give to every man. Ars Antiqua
shares this hope. Our presentations seek, in addition,
to offer pleasure, entertainment — a sense of the humor
and wit as well as of the profound thought the arts pro-
voke.

Combined Arts

“To this end. Ars Antiqua has labored to conceive
a new form of theatre, based in fact upon one of the
very oldest forms of theatre — the combining of many
arts in one dramatic—concert production.

“We strive to illustrate a period of history, or an
abiding philosophical idea, or a major artistic figure —
drawn from our chosen period of interest —- the
Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque. We feel this period
offers the modern audience a rich source ofinspirntion,
instruction, and delight.

Peier, Paul, Mary’s Natural Beauty
Displayed In 'lnmnrinvi’ Album

by Pete Nicholas 8- Gary Prouil

From the great interest in folk
music shown by Albany State stu-
dents, we think folk music has a
permanent place in the A.S.P., but
the co-authors pretend to beneitber
representatives nor authorities on
folk music. In ibis weekly column
we shall attempt, with no small
share of editorial connneni, to de-
scribe “what’s happening in the
world of folk music.”

We should like to explore folk
music in blues, ballads, gospel,
guitar, bluegrass, and popular
groups. We should especially like
to report on the sort of popular mu-
sic cnlled “folk rock." We plan to
bring you reviews and interview of
folk performers appearing on cam-
pus iind locally.

Current Folk

Occasionally, as in this edition,
we should like to present current
folk recordings. We invite sugges-
tions and comments from folk inu-
sic enthusiasts on our weekly re-

marks.

l’d like now to review the new
album of Peter, Paul and Mary,
entitled “See What Tomorrow

Brings." “if I Were Free" and
“Because All Men Are Brothers"
are “protest” songs, with iheiaiter
being unusual in the fact. that the
music is taken iroin one of Bach’s
works with the song also being

. , . .
su‘yglglllil Dggdgiulcslund (With You in
My Dreams) injects a bit of humor,
sounding like the music of ilie’zo’s.
Some of the Bouiie's cuts are more
"foiky" than this one. “liangnmn”
is a fairly standard commercial folk
iuno. Although the song, (the siory
of a boy whose family comes to
watch hlin die and who is finally
saved by his sweetheart) is a little
non-sonsicul, this arrangement
makes it. llsiennble.

"Juno, June” is kliid of gospels
type music, but last and good. “The
Rising of the Moon“ is an lrishbal-
ind of their revolution; blues are
g'opresenicd in “Brother, Can You
Spare u Dime" and in “’l‘ryln' to
Win," with the laiier being a more
jovial and .iiunioraus iype of blues:

best cuts on the album. “Betty and

quarrei’bbit, nothing special. "The
Last Thing on My Mind," written by
Tom Paxton (whose new album I
will review in part next week) is a
nice love song, but can’t compare
with “The First Time Ever I Saw
Your Face," which, in my opinion,
is the best song on the album.

Peter, Paul and Mary’s style,
plus the natural beauty of the song,
make it outstanding. The album is

The race issue, which would un- '
doubtedly have confused much ofthu

ferred with the main business ofihe’
has wisely been kept out.

Martin Busnm, as the ship’s
doctor newly returned tot'acilve duty
who finds that his services are not
appreciated, has a few silly lines
early in the film, but on the whole
he is extremely effective,especlally
when he argues with Wldmark over
a sick radar operator.

Eric Portman is effective as the
old U-boat captain who is now an
emotionally detached N.A.T.O. ob-
server and James MacArthur is;
appropriately unobtrusive as the
young officer.

Toy Ship

“The Bedford Incident" is a good
film, well-plotted and well-acted,
but hardly-flawless. 1t suffers con-
siderably in the technical end, es-
pecially when the ship is shown
cruising through the water. Ifever
a toy boat could be picked out

some sea movte, it can be picked
out in this one. And the icebergs
look even phonler than the little
motorized model of the Bedlord.

Fortunately, such scenes are kept
to a respectable minimum, and the
attention stays riveted on the de-
stroyer-sub conﬂict.

    

School of Psychotherapy
Stresses Meaningful life

by Lorry Epstein

Freud and Adler developed the
first two Viennese schools of psy-
ciiotherapy.

Since the end of the Second World
War, a third, developed by Viktor
l-‘rankl, has been established and
most successfully espoused in
Frankl’s book "Man’s Search for
Meaning."

Logothorapy
This third school, culled Logo-
therupy, stresses the importance of
man’s search for a reason for life.

“Man’s search for meaning is a-

prluim'y force in his life and not a
“secondary rationalization" of iii-
silnctuul-di'ives."

’i‘wontleih-oeniury man is a vic-
ilin of an "existential vacuum."
At the beginning of human history,
man lost some of the basic animal
instincts in which an animal’s be—
havior is embedded and by which it
is secured. Such security, like Para-
dise, is closed to man forever;
man has to make choices.

Traditions

"In addition to ibis, however, man
has suffered another loss in his most
recent development: the trndiiions
that had buttressed his behavior are
now rapidly diminishing.

"No instinct tells him what he has
to do, and no iradiiionteilshlm what
he ought to do; such he will notknow

he will be governed by what others
want him to do, thus increasingly,
falling prey to conformism."

Broaden Spectrum

’I‘ba iogotherapist does not attempt
to create a new being out of his
patient, but rather to iielp broaden
the spectrum of meaningful exis-
tence for the patient.

"The role played by a logo-thera-
pist is rather that of aneye special-
ist than that of a painter."

The theory was developed by
Frunkl during his three years at
various Nazi concentration camps
where be viewed the suffering, the
apathy and the hopelessness of this
extreme example of a life without
a goal.

Separated From Families

Men and women were separated
from iheir families and friends,
all their possessions were takch
away and they were forced to work
under deplorable conditions with
small amounts of food to nourish
them. Each one asked himself: “Why
um i suffering?"

There are three main ways of
discovering a mean to life. These
are (i) be performing a dead, (2) by
experiencing a value and (a) by
suffering.

“Suffering ceases tome suffer-
ing in some way at the moment it
finds a meaning, such as the mean-
ing of a sacrifice."
