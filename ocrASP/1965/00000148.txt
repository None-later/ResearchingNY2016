APA initiates Blood 1[locations

The brothers of Alpha Pi Alpha
are sponsoring a program which
will allow university students to do-
nate blood for the servicemen in
Viet Nam. Donations for the Blood
for G.i.'s Program will be accepted
during the week of February 14.

Other Campuses

The idea for this program was
fostered by similar efforts which
have been successful on many cam-
puses across the nation. of the uni-
versities in the surrounding areas,
Hudson Valley and Rensselaer Poly-
technic Institute are presently work-

ing on similar programs.

APA will enlist the support and
cooperation of the other fraternities
on campus. They also hope to gain
full support ofthe faculty and student
body.

Permission Blanks

Since the law requires persons
under twenty one years to obtain
parental consent in order to donate
blood, the ASP will publish special
permission forms for this purpose
in next Friday’s paper. The exact
time and place of the blood donation
will also be published.

Pr

win Mayor thisr ,sr,~, _
plan for our new government .was
accepted by the general student body,
by virtue of the favorable referen-
dum on the Constitution of the Gen-
tral Council. This constitution pro-
vides thebasis for all levels of
government.

' Each areaof government is broken
down into various levels, in order
to provide the maximum representa-
tion. The purpose, of this in ‘ ’

is to initiate legislation at the most
basic level; in that way the people
who are most closely concerned will
be the most qualified to form these
"laws" and the "laWs"willbemore
effective. ,

Since May, the bulk of the legis-
lation and organization has been done
at the Commission and Central
Council level. This is due to the
timing of elections and general dis-
organization caused by housing
changes, group changes, and lack
of time.

The main problems have been
constitutional questions, budget
rules, general rules for the Coun-
cil, and approval of member consti-
tutions. For this reasonthe hoped
for process of legislational organi-
zation has been operating in reverse.

It is hoped that when the govern-
ment has finally established itself
and has its committees and commis-
sions under control, that the original
plan of operation will take effect.
When that time comes, legislation
will proceed somewhat as follows:

As an example, let us say Art
Council wishes to have a show. This
would be discussed within the group
and the idea in motion form would
be passed. The piall would then go
to the Arts Board. If this body ap-
proved the show, it might be dis-
cussed at the Commission level,
which would be Community Pro-
gramming.

Considering the magnitude of the
program, the Commission might
want Central Council’s approval for
the expenditure of funds. This would
be the final step necessary to ap-
roval of the art show. It must bi

All clubs, organizations and re
de‘nce units have representation
all levels of this legislative set-up.
Certain areas have board levels,
due to their complexity or range of
representstion. other areas have
only the Commission, plus a possible
two board breakdown.

For ",thef‘ ‘ ‘ on
Religious Affairs has no breakdown
other than the various clubs in-
volved, while Living Area Affairs
starts With the dorms, then the
Quad Boards, and then to the Com-
mission level.

Executive Branch

The executive branch of the gov-
ernment structure is based mainly
on the president and vice president
of Central Council and the"cabinet”
which is composed of the various
commission chairmen and chairmen
of standing committees. This group
plans most of the organizational
moves of the units of Student Asso-
ciation.

Financial powers rest mainly with
this group, and with the approval of
the Central Council, which also rep-
resents all areas of concern. ’These
are the people who sign vouchers
and plan for long range policies.

The “executive office" of Student
Association is room Bin Brubacher.
In this room, are two large file's
and four desks, belonging to the
president, vice president, chairman
of Finance Committee, and fulltime
Student Association secretary.

Mailboxes for main bodies of
government and communications are
also located in this office. All mail
is sorted and placed in these boxes
for the various organization heads to
collect and handle. Many government
meetings are held in this room, and
all reports and minutes'are kept on
file there.

by Harry Nuchols

Bridge Club's third tournament of
the semester was held Sunday, No-
vember 14. Jack Taylor and Marty
Bergen were the winners with last
time’s winners, John Zobel and
Steve Kliman, placing second. The
hand which appears here is one of
the reasons for the 78% game the
winners accumulated.

It is very tempting to open the
South hand with a forcing bid, but
South wisely overcame the temp-
tation. It is a point shy for a two
no trump opening and the distri-
bution is wrong. A strong suitopen-
ing would also be wrong, for the
hand contains too many losers.

North’s four spade bid is perfect.
It describes a hand with less than
nine high card points, at least five
trump, and distributional values —
a singleton or a void.

South’s tlve diamond bid was a
slam try. It asked North if he had
a maximum with help in diamonds.
Nother had exactly that and dutifully

see you there to challenge the cur-
rent champions.

"Experiment in International

Panel Discusses
Program To Improve

leather Education

Richmond Va. (CPS) — A two-year
internship, close screening, and
early exposure to class situations
were recommended by a three-man
panel as steps to upgrade and pro-
fessionalize teacher education. The
panel was presented at a meeting of
the Southern Council on Teacher Ed-
ucation last week.

The major difficulty in putting
through such recommendations
would be in finding school systems
that could handle such a project.
Several proposals were made, in-
cluding that professional certifica-
tion should be granted only after
completion of atwo-yearinternpro-
gram and a master's degree, that a
screening program for prospective
teachers and continued interviews
with education students throughout
their college careers be set up.

It was also recommended that
would-be teachers be exposed to

spent two weeks in Putney,Vermont
at the School of international Train-

which included as topics the various
sectors of the American economy
and culture, particularly in its re-
lation to the developing countries.
