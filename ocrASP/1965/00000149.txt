*ordinatOr of the Summer Planning Conference has an-
nounced that there are openings for approximately 10
~ qualified undergraduates.Application forms are avail-
‘able ‘in the Office for Student~Affairs, Draper. 110.

The Summer Planning
Conference'is the program
which was instituted two
years ago to replace the
Fresh Weekend method of

‘ freshmen orientation.

Under the SPC program, groups
of 150-200 entering freshmen come
to Albany during the summer for
three days' of testing, counseling,
and orientation.

Student assistants would live with
the freshmen in the residence halls,
each assistant being responsible
for about 25 freshmen. They would
provide informal counseling as well
as leading two formal groupdiscusé
sions. The SPC this summer will

.probably be held on the new campus.

Administrative Help
Among the other responsibilities
of the student assistants are to help

with various administrative details,
such as preparing packets, assist-
ing with registration, and helping
individual students to prepare their
fall schedules.

Aside fromtheir duties with the
prospective freshmen, the student
assistants will evaluate various as-
pects of the program and will tabu-
late the evaluations which the trash
will provide. The evaluations last
year showed a high degree of satis-
faction with the program.

The students selected will be ex-
pected to attend a training seesion
in the latter part of June. They will
then work at each of the three-day
conferences which will run until the
middle of.August.~

Room 8: Board
All assistants receive room and
board. In addition, students working
for the first year will be paid $350
while students returning for the

d g r will receive $400.

"Technical Talent Search," a
program designed to help college
students from the Upper Hudson
Region obtain jobs at home follow-
ing graduation, was announced by
Schenectady General Electric.

The program is for students grad-
uating in 1966 and 1967 with degrees
in engineering, mathematics and the
physical sciences. Also eligible to
attend are candidates for advanced
degrees in these fields as well as
college graduates who will be re-
leased from active military serv-
ice, or those who have been re-
cently released and have notstarted
their careers.

in announcing this program, H.J.
Parker, manager of Schenectady
Relations and Utilities, said the
“area has long been known for its
highly competent young people who
attend college and we want the first
opportunity to discuss with them
their future plans."

The program will be held on
Tuesday, December 28, at the Gen-
eral Electric Research and Develop-
ment Center starting at 11:30 a.m.

Parker said that the program was
scheduled purposely during the

 Christmas because most students

are at home. Features of the day’s
program will include an orientation
to the General Electric Company
and the opportunity to discuss job
openings with people in the company
directly responsible for hiring in
the technical fields in Schenectady,
Hudson Falls, Fort Edward and
Waterford. . .,

Changes Name
To Colloquium

The Research Society of SUNYA
has recently decided to rename
itself the University Colloquium.
Along with the name-change, it has
initiated a change in format which it
hopes will stimulate interest in the
organization and bolster a lagging
attendance at its meetings.

The Society was organized in the
late 1050’s with the purpose ofin-
teresting the general faculty in the
specialized researches of particular
disciplines. The papers which were
presented at the meetings became
so specialized, however, that mem-
bers of the faculty not ill that dis-
cipline were unable to understand
them.

This year the Society, now the
Colloquium, has changed its format
to one of discussion and interdis-
ciplinary encounter. While papers
will still be read at the lnontllly
meetings, they will he prepared
with the idea of interestlng a gen-
eral audience. Informal discussion
between the author and the audience
will then be encouraged.

This year the Colloquium is un-
der the direction of a three member
committee. The committee includes
Benjamin E. Chi of the Physics De-
partment, Richard H. Kendall of the
History Department, and Mrs. Aud-
rey Kouvel of the Romance Lan-
guages Department.

Phi Beta Lambda Debate

The November 30 program meet-
ing of Phi Beta Lambda was fligh-
lighted by a discussion between
abor and management on the sub-
ject of automation.

Gregory Reilly, Secretary of the
Labor Council of Albany, viewed the
topic from the standpoint of the
worker, tracing automation back to
the industrial Revolution. Accord.
ing to Mr. Reilly, the AFL-CIO’s
idea of a solution to the “per-
ceived” problem is to shorten the
work week.

Robert Kurkendall, the Director
of Industrial Relations at the Huyck
Felt Company, opposed Mr. Reilly
by representing management in the
dlswssion. In his talk, a history of
the company was given with specific
references to incidents when auto-

matlon played a role in the de-
velopment of the company.

Dr. Irving Sabghir, Professor of
Business at S.U.N.Y.A., was mod-
erator for both the discussion and
the question and answer period that
followed.

Before the meeting, Mr. Reilly
and Mr. Kurkendall were guests of
Phi Beta Lambda for dlnner’and
were taken on a tour of the new
campus.

Earlier in the meeting, pins were
presented to two faculty members of
the Business department

Volume of Poetry

State University senior Martin
Lewis has written a volume ofpoetry
entitled “Mynt Green’s The Disor-
dered Spring.”

Mr. Lewis is a native of Albany
and a former U. S. Army weather
observer. During his service at
White Sands Missile Range in New
Mexico, and Fort Churchill, Canada,
he began writing poetry.

Poetry, for Mr. Lewis, is an es-
cape out of the everyday world. The
poet rebels against "realistic"
trends ill verse and the magazine
trend toward keeping poetry "short,
crisp and illuminating.”

Publication date is Monday, De-
cember thl. The book will be on sale
at the State University Bookstore as
well as at many 'l‘ri-Clty bookstores.

Albanla'ns this week heard alead-
ing Catholic layman accuse his
church of preferring obedience and

,order to honesty. At 'an all-night

“Teach-in" held Tuesday at Iron-
workers’ Hall, a tense, dedicated
crowd of over four hundred con-
sidered the possibilities of "Cath-
olic Action in the Modern World."

A squad of speakers headed by
John Leo, edito'rof“Commonweal,"
a Roman Catholic weekly review
highly-esteeemed by American in-
tellectuals, and including James
Mancuso, Professor of Psychology

‘at SUNYA, talked and led discussion

for eight hours. Most of those pres-
ent were Siena, St. Rose and Albany
State students,
sprinkling of liberal lay leaders
from the Albany community, and at
least three Roman Catholic priests.

The key idea of the evening was
freedom of conscience and the pri-
macy of the laity. John Le attacked
those church leaders who foster “a
church of comfort and consolation—
a woman’s church,” and maintained
that the "primary way of being
Christian in today’s world is being
political.”
church stresses the wrong virtues
for our particular society: obedience
and order. These virtues tend to
support the status quo, and "it’s
precisely the status quo thathas to
go."

On the other hand, according to
Leo, the church has sacrified hon-
esty in order to emphasize ana-
chronistic virtues. Hypocrisy and
lies are the anathema of our so-
ciety, but not of the modern church.
“Ninety percent of the church ac-
tivities in this country,” said Leo
have been decoted to manias about
sex and communism. ...Not one
Catholic bishop or one priest spoke
out against the vast horror of the
atom bomb at Hiroshima. Presum-
ably if they’d dropped contracep-
tives instead of bombs there’d have
been an uproar."

Speakers from the floor, earnest,
dedicated, questioning, asked if col-
lege students had to commit them-
selves to social action, if priests
should. But there seemed no ques-
tion that the crowd at Ironworkers
Hall was there precisely because
they set the virtue of honesty above
obedience.

«nas- ANTIQUA, ’a mu-
sical-dramatic company
will present Dantte’s "Di-
vineComedy” Monday, De-
cember 13 at 8:30 p.m. in
Page Hall. The presenta-
tion will be in celebration
of Dante’s 700th Anniver-
sary.

The fourteen members of the tour-
ing company, all of whom are veter-
an professional performers, are
making their first appearance at the
University. The company is under
the direction ofDorothy Amarandos,
who founded ARS ANTIQUA elgilt
years ago.

. ‘Mosterwork
0f the dozen masterwol'ks that
mark western history from the "il-
fad," none held more importance
for its contemporaries or for fol-
lowing ages than Dante’s “Divine
.Comedy.” Complex, poetic and
secular, it remains as the climactic
gesture of the creative mind of the
medieval scholar.
in bringing such a work to its
stage, ARS ANTIQUA seeks to re-
create its values rather tllan its
point for point details, in an ex-
citing performance that blends mu-
sic of the period, dance, and the
human voice in poetry and song.
in The result is a unique modern

function at ‘Divinc comely

interpretation of the “Divine Com-
edy” in a form that remains true
to its medieval roots.

Scripts .

The script for thisproduction was
written expressly for ARS ANTIQUA
by script writer and producer Sig
Moglen of C.B.S. Television's Cam-
era Three. No stranger to Dante.
Moglen produced Dante’s “Inferno”
on Camera Three.

The production is being staged
and choreographed bthoda Levine.
Miss Levine has choreographed for
many opera companies including
The Metropolitan Opera’s National
Company, Festival of Two Worlds
at Spoleto, italy and the N.B.C.
Opera.

The demanding role of Dante will
be created for the ARS ANTIQUA
stage by well known classical actor
of films, television, and Broadway,
Leonard Hicks.

Production

The production is fully staged with
costumes and scenery and a fourteen
member company. The cast is di-
vided in this manner: three singers,
three dancers, three actors alld four
musicians. The company is under the
artistic direction of Dorothy Amar-
andos who founded the company some
eight years ago.

All cast members are vetel'allsof
the classic and Broadway stage.
