height, and experience together. We' erlo‘okedperhaps
the most important‘qualityuﬂie.teampossesses that was
the largest single factoitgin the Sienawwin — desire.

We had sized the team up on statisticsalone. and we
made some hasty conclusionsfrom therp'MBut what we
saw Saturday night must go under an unlisted statistic —
“intangibles.”

Last season “Doc’s” highly successful cag'ers were
a well-rounded outfit. possessing alllthe ingredients of
a winning team. They played deliberate ball, relying on
"sure". shots and powerful rebounding to insure them-
selves of many points. On defense the Feds of old could
afford to give up a number of shots, confident that the
big battlers under the boards would get the ball for
State. '

This year’s team can't afford themselves that lux-
ury. They must play aggressive defense. constantly
pressuring the opponent into a bad or forced shot.
This is exactly what the Dane hoopsters did Saturday
night. They were the most aggressive team we’ve seen
in a number of years. and without adoubt they we re the
best conditioned squad we’ve ever seen.

“Doc” worked his men hard from the first weeks of
conditioning practice. Those strenuous hours oftraining
paid off in chips Saturday night, as the Siena hoopsters,
obviously tired from the harrying of State defenders,
got sloppy and committed many personal fouls. which
cost them theu'game. We only wish the Danes could have
put a few more free throws In to open the game up a
little. ,

We feel something should be said about the crowd,
While it was a large and exceedingly charged-upcrowd,
it was also a well—behaved one. Considering the size of
the turnout and the rivalry between the two schools,
the crowd was a very well behaved one. We deplore the
action of the referee In stopping play to ask over the
PA system for pollcement 0 watch over the Siena
rooters. And does a certain area sports writer feel
that the throwing of a piece of paper on the courts is
akin to “two near riots?” These two people were the
only ones out of order.

Tonight the Danes host Montclair College, and to-
morrow night they battle the University of Buffalo.
These are two big games for the State hoopsters, and
we feel that if the team can wlnjeither onelof them they
stand a good chance for a winningseason. We don’t
hope for a dual wIn because of,,the strain of two tough
games back-to~baek on such a small squad.

But l'd better stop there, remembering those "in—
tan Ibles.“ ,

' Danes Face Tough Pair

Fresh off an inspiring
two-point win over Siena
College, the Great Dane
basketball team faces a
hard weekend in the Ar-
mory, vying with Montclair
State tonight and the Uni-
versity of Buffalo tomor-
row night.

The outcome of these two contests
will go a long way in forecasting the
hardcourt season for the Danes, as
both teams are highly-touted hoop
squads.

Last year the Pads dropped the
season opener to Montclair State,
bowing 77-71 despite a herculean
effort by Dick Crossett, who tallied
35 points. Montclair' was paced by
two talented stars. Bob Gleason

22 points in that game, and Jack

Buffalo

In the University of Buffalo game,
the Statesman bowed 69-58 In an
away contest and by seven points in
a later home game.

Between the two teams, they ac-
counted for half of State's six losses
last year, in an otherwise fabulous
season.

The Buffalo losses virtuallyelim-
