in retaining a policy of extending» salar—
ies tothOp _SA positions is anenbouraging
action. '

The opposition to salaries comes from
people who deal more in the idealistic
realm than in the_rea1istlc realm. We
agree" that editors and station manager
should be able to take on their jobs
from altruistic motivations.

Unfortunately these and other posi-
tions have overwhelming responsibili-
ties. They preclude holding other jobs.
The economic sacrifices, made by a
holder of a position currently salaried
are too great to justify not providing
salaries when the money is available.

The need for salaries has been dem-
onstrated over a period of years. It is
about time the opponents to salaries
realized that they are a minority. have

the time of the majority;

ilress Code Ignored

We always regret a situation where a
man in a position of responsibility uses
his position to impose his own parochial
views on others.

The dress code is a case in point.
Very few of the faculty bother with this
assinine code.

Who cares if a woman wears boots, if
a nian doesn’t shelve, if a man doesn't
wear socks, or if awoman wears slacks?

This is the 1960’s. Perhaps someone
should take a sabbatical and find out

is unfortunate. At a time when the
ASP is seeking to serve in new ways
such as publishing the book list and
the course list, we are unable to serve
in the old and standard ways.

The lateness of the schedule is not
due to the people who are doing the
work. They are working as fast as any-
one can expect them to.

The problem is that, like Topsy, our
exam schedule “just growed.” It istime
that we moved directly to a permanent
exam schedule with which students and
faculty would know ‘Wheh‘”’the exams
would be when they sign up for the
course.

ICOMMUNI
Criticizes Newspaper

To the Editor: ‘

‘ Eor nearly twelve Weeks l"havé '
beeh among the large number of
students who are, to say the least,
disappointed with our newspaper.
The disappointment is even greater
considering what we remember as
last year’s ASP.

The former editors-in-chief had
an Ilmpartial sense of the propor- '
tionate' importance of‘h’otrs‘iisms, I"
a better-than-avsrage- command of I
the? English language (ii:was stated”
in the Sept. it that Mr. Galu is a
graduate student in English — or
was that another of the newspaper's
mistakes?), and a non-biased view-
point. Lest there be any misunder-
standing on the part of certain im-
perceptive members of the staff,
let me elaborate. .

The most noticeable and offensive
mistakes are those resulting from
carelessness; witness the issue of
Nov. 5, 1965, in which the names
and photographs of two professors
were interchanged, and likewise,
the phoiod and captains of Al Bad-
er’s pie-in-ihe-face, and Cynthia
Goodman's moderating the Ayn Rand
panel were reversed.

in addition, another photo. was up-
side down. Secondly, it seems tov
me that the quality of the writing
of too many articles is that of a
high school student plodding through
a composition assignment in which
he has absolutely no interest. The
use ci‘ epithets, repetition of the
full titles of the subject discussed
(whether person, play, orprogram),
is nothing but unecessary padding.

it makes for extremely boring
reading. Next to this point i must
place the editorials; besides their
very opinionated and condescending
nature, they are insipid. On what
level can be the mind which pro,
duces such drivoling trivia‘ which
socrnsaio have been written fifteen
minutes before the printing.of the.
paper?

liqw can the editors expect'read-
era girl, respect them :or their edi-rzz
torisisI- as was the case laatyaar.

Lastly, in commenting of the lack
of proportion and coverage given to
voting news items, i refer to the .
edit 'lol of Nov. 5, 1065, in which
the filters state, “mine Univer-
sity. In grown so big that it is dif-
ficu or us to know what is going
on o campus."

for this citizenz‘ ignorance of the

law provides not excuse.

“ What‘ makes this more deplorable
is that it' is the duty of the news-
paper to knowiiof and publish all
events for the benefit ofthe students,
who have a legitimate reason in the
size of the University to be unaware
of them. I

I know personally of a particular
news item which has been in the
hands of the staff since Nov, 28
and promised, frIOnt page coverage
using. . full'.artl'cle submitted;
the its as "published, onIpage 3,
Dec."'7"‘CUt"'to 'the""bare essen-
tials." ‘ “

This, and other similar instances
concerning various groups, is not
journalism. The general attitude of
the entire newspaper this year
seems to be, “Yes, we’ll publish a
paper — when we have .1 few min-
utes to write an editorial or an
article, or plan a layout, 01' set
up type — but "first things first."

After thirty minutes of limited
debate, the bill was to put to a vote
and passed 13-5-5 with no other
amendments added to the bill.

After the passage of the financial
policy; the j matting; turned to I the

chairman df thea'd 'hochdmmittee
on student tax, introduced a state-
ment of policy on student tax. '

The bill said that membership
in SA and the right to receive the
benefits and services rendered un-
der SA is contingent upon the pay-
ment of student tax. Also member-
ship in any activity financed by SA
shall be contingent upon the payment
of the tax.

The bill recommended that Pan-
helienic Council and the various
Greek bodies make membership
contingent upon payment of student
tax.

Other provisions of the bill asked
that all communications niedla con-
duct editorial campaigns in behalf
of student tax and a Standing Corri-
mittee on Student Tax shall be as-
tabiished by Central Council.
