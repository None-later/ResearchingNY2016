Pi Alpha will sponsor a
Blood for G.I.’s Program,
tentatively the week of Feb-
ruary 14, 1966.

The brothers, like many State

J's one means through which such
concern catt be expressed.

If any principle is involved, it is
not one of endorsement or disap-

it is centered upon the fact that
U. S. men are dying.

Whole blood is used in opera-
tions to combat shock due to severe
burns or wounds. No bloodis wasted.
If not used for transfusions within
21 days, it is made into blood
derivatives, which are used as pre-
ventative medicines.

People hesitate to donate, blood

This fear can be allayed if po-

precaution is taken for the safety
