Members of Debate Council who
have been active in organizing the

F rachtenberg also extends credit to
the speech department for their help
in recruiting students and for help
in the topic area.

they might gain greater capability
in handling a wider range of topic
types. They also might learn to

-handle different forms of debate.

The debate coach also feels that
the present form offers a great deal
of training for any student. It teaches
reasoning, research techniques, and
effective self-expression.

In areas more related to the area
of speech and discussion, it teaches
outlining, analyzation techniques,
effective handling of types of evi-
dence, persuasive argument, and the
difference between assertion and
fact.

Mr. Frachtenberg also said that
he would like to see the Albany
debaters work with the Parliamen-
tary form of debate used by the de-
bate teams of England. He also
mentioned a form of debate termed
dialectical disputation.

This particular form of debate
was used by the medieval scholas-
tics. Some forln of cross exam-
ination is used in this type of de-
bate which does not take place in
the debate form presently used.

In the Varsity division it has been
relatively inactive as debaters this
year, due to the various other func-
tions, have been unable to perform.
Key members qualifying this area
have been working on the legisla-
tive assembly.

They also have been planning to
help the debate team of Albany
High School to plan for the high
school debate run-offs inthe spring.
The last week in March will usth-
in the state high school finals, and
it is expected that Albany will help
the students with this also.

e Newman Association
at_.,SUNYA has been “up-
dating a_ d‘ren‘ewing" itself
in the past two years, along
with " the entire National
Newman, Movement in the
spirit of reform generated
by tho_recently-closed Vati-
can Council 11.

The National Newman Associa-
tion, now called the Newman Aposto--
late, has updated .its concept of the
religious organization on the secu-
lar campus. This has been accom-
plished in accordance. with the ideal
of its patron, Cardinal Newman, that
the Christian Community on asecu-
iar campus should be "cultivated as
a wonderful vineyard of God."

As ‘a Roman Catholic Apostolate
it strives to find Christ embodied
in the Christian laymen..

Here at SUNYA, Newman has tried
to achieve this goal by revampingits
concept of a Newman Association.
It is no longer a “club” but an ac-
tual Parish which is comprised of
and designed for students. As :1
Parish all students are welcome to
attend its functions, its services,
or to drop in at the Center at 148
Western Avenue.

Service Prolects

To carry out its Apostolate, the
Newman Parish sponsors many ac-
tivities and programs. It is cur-
rently involved in organizing and
coordinating social action in the
south-end of Albany in an attempt to
continue the work of Father Bona-
venture O’Brien. It hopes to arrange
for students to go to the poverty
stricken areas of the city to help
the poor to help themselves.

In the field of social action New-
man has also sponsored a tutoring
service in the south-end for the
past year. Under this program,
SUNYA students tutor individual
needy children in whatever courses
they require extra work in. Rides
are provided to Father Young’s Par-
ish where the tutoring is conducted.

SocIul Programs
Newman also sponsors aprogram
of speakers jointly with Campus
Christian Council. The last speaker,
Paul Chapman, spoke December 9
on “The Secular Man." On Friday’s
5 facult members come to

the center to speak and discuss

various topics of interest. These

sessions are open to all state fac-

ulty and students. Informal discus-

tseion is given much time at the cen-
I‘.

Begun last Sunday evening, and
continuing Sundays from now on,
suppers are served at 5:30 for the
dorm residents and all interested
people. The price is 50¢. Every
other Tuesday evening and on
special occasions, a covered-dish
supper is served.

Speakers attend, supper is served,
and discussion ensues for the rest
the evening. The most recent and
most successful covered-dish sup-
pers have been "welcome" and
"good-bye” suppers for the Jesuit
priests from Auriesville who come
each month.

Liturgical Worship

Perhaps the most important of
the Newman services offered on
this campus is that of the Liturgy.
On Sunday, morning and evening
masses are conducted at LaSalle
Chapel, across the street from Wa-
terbury Hall on Patridge Street.
These masses conform to all the
renovations in the Mass as outlined
by the Ecumenical Council. In addi-
tion, three masses are said daily
at. the Newman Center, at 9:05,
11:15 and at 4:30 (Thursday at
3:30).

Several courses in theology, de-
signed i'or the college student, are
also conducted: “Life in Christ"
and “Maturity and Morality,”which
is conducted by the Jesuits. The
current Newman Jesuit is Father
Thomas King, a theology expert.
Jesuits are available for speaking
engagements, interviews, and dis-
cussions in the center or at the
dorms.

Activities Coordinated

The Center is currently develop-
ing a library. It consists of many
excellent books on religion and re-
lated subjects and alinostevcry ma-
jor Catholic periodical. Anyone can
borrow any book any time he wishes.
There is a full time chaplain, Father
Paul Smith, who is always available
for interviews, discussion, or for
any . problems which may arise.

All these activities are coordi-
nated by a slate of officers and an
executive board of directors. The
president of Newman is Sue Boyd
of Delmar. Her board consists of
the other officers; Jim Stuwart,
vice president; Beth Boyd, secre-
tary; and Anne Strnsser, treasurer;
plus committee cmlrmen fres m n

Building Better Bridge

, by Harry Nuckols
Contract bridge is a game of
generalities. For instance, it is
Benerally true that a hand with a
suitable fit will play at least one

trick better in a suit than in No '

Trump. Many conventions have been
devised to exploit this generality.

Perhaps the most used of these
is the Stayman convention which is
used with a No Trump opening bid.
In response to the normal strong
one No Trump opening, a bid of two
clubs is forcing on the opener for
one round and asks him to bid a
four card major.

The two club bidder promise seven
or more high card points and at
least one major suit of four or
more cards.

In today's hand, South knew from
North's rabid that he had fourhearts
and seven-nine high card points.
Since he was ‘on a maximum, he put
the hand in game.

The play of the hand presents an
interesting problem in timing. South
must take the spade finesse and
trump two spades in the dummy
before he tries to draw trump.
Otherwise, he will fall one trick
short of his contract,

The king of clubs is won in the
dummy and the queen of spades is
finessed. The best West can do is
return a trump. East will win and
continue trump, the dummy hand
winning. Now a spade to the ace,
"1“ s allude, a club to the queen,

'* ~Wm-u—w—w. w....,.m.....-...“_....w

ruff the last spade.

Only now can the South hand be
entered to draw the last trump. A
diamond is then conceded to the
ace and the balance of the tricks
claimed.

A heart lend originally will de-'
foot the contract if East ducks the
trick. Now when West gets in with
tho spade king, a trump to the ace
and a trump return sinks the con-
tract.

P.S. I hope to see you Sunday
afternoon for the tournament.

Student Interest important

The future of Newman depends
largely on the interest of the stu-
dents. Participation in Newman af-
fairs is solicited. When the new
campus is ready, it is hoped that
Newman will, at least temporarily,
be able to obtain a house near the
new campus to continue its work.

According to Miss Boyd, the goal
of Newman is to “show a witness
to Christian ethics, ideals, and com-
mitment, not just through the
speakers or the liturgy on Sunday,
but through the examples of the
student-Christian. Newman can be
a part of the University Commun-
ity, both collectively and individ-
ually.

We see a duty to make a contri-
bution to the fulfillment of the true
universitv communltv.”

Chess Corner

by Bob Merritt

It is generally acknowledged that
a successful attack cannot be gen-
erated without control of the center.
The very purpose of opening strategy
is to command the vital center,
while the plethora of openings are
different approaches to this goal.

The Queen's gambit is indorsed
as one of the soundest and most
effective openings. The successful
variations follow the same general
lines. The Q Pawn and QB Pawn
are aggressively posted on the fourth
rank with the K Pawn anchoring the
Q Pawn on K2.

This pawn structure gives White
a solid footing in the center, and
does not hinder the K Bishop on
strategic Q3. Tile early advance of
the QB Pawn gives white tempo with
62-132 as the Queen magnifies the
attack against a cactled king and
bolsters the Queen side iurces.

White further dominates the con-
tor with R-Bl nddlngdouble strength
to an open file. if Black fails to
neutralize the pressure he will be
in serious trouble.
