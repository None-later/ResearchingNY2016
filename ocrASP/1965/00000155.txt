Howaver, I would like to disagree

with some of the conclusions drawn '1

by Mr. Provost and with some of
the inferenceshe has made.

In my last column and those pre-
ceding it, I have attempted to make
few value judgments concerning our
involvement in the conflict .in-Viel-
nnm. I have attempted toobiectively"

analyze the situation andtopresent ‘-

what I think is he- viewpoint of that
administration.

I believe that MruProvut-is in»
correct in his definitiow either na-
tional interest. The nationaiinterest-

3' the national

civilian population'b‘ecomee'a‘ target -‘
in the same'rway that soldiers-and

'~munition plants become targets.

' World Wat‘ II illustrates this prin-

ciple, as 'I, pointed out ‘in mylast
column. Germany, England, and the" - ‘

United states each attempted'to car‘- 
taii the enemy, population's contrt-'
bution to' the war effort by destroy-
ing the enemy population; ' "

The bombings of London, Ham- -

follow this principle. All were de-‘ "

signed to decrease the power of the

enemy. (other factOrs also entered‘
. into some of these bombings)“   '

which .we follow throughout the “play.” I"‘use the word
“play,” realizing its incorrectncss, to save space.
The play, is .a series of many scenes, each from one

andu’accordingl .,. each scene was a complete episode

shotsZ on their humorous decline. We follow the varied
character-s,- “the'ju'Ioman with her supposed insatiable
soulﬁl’héﬁiés; Vine socially unsatisfied. the lonely, the

hauntedwandi the ~many others.

   , Novel as Drama

The play failed in presenting the novel in a dra—
matic 'form. The facts, the events, the humor, and the
wordﬁcwetje all there. but many of the paper charac-
terizatlbhs and the entire meaning was not: and therein
lies the failure. The book was more than humor; it
was emotional, strong; it was meaningful. Throughout
lirdeeper, than the comedy, ,was a constant feeling of
loneliness. Ché'eve'r' wrote of the sadness accompanying
theeloneliness. With this. be depicted the failure to
achieve satisfaction, and its sadness. Disappointly,
the play lost this.

-. Emilels insatiable hunger; Betsey’s dissatisfaction
with life, Melissa’s unsatisfied lust and desires; the
“Toll Man’s’ﬁ loneliness; the death of Mr. Spofford and
his kittens, neither ofwhich would be missed; and on and
0n: all of these were treated analytically instead of
abstractly. and the emotion was lost.

' 'Emation makes way for acting. and this, for the most
Part. Was well done. In the case of George McDermott,
the narrator,  if George had failed, the play would
have failed; this is not to imply that if George had
SROQGéi-‘led‘ the play would follow, because George did
Succeed. [magnificently and the play did not. He didn’t
merely say words, he used them: he felt them, he
molded them. Outstanding! .

Hopefully. we will see more of Bruce Tiffany and
Diane Somerville, Both though in smaller roles, were
more alive and more realistically expressive than
nearly all the cast.

Overacting and underplaylng. in the cases of Florence
Kaem and Alexandra Sadori respuctively, greatly weak-
ened the ovorall acting performance of the cast. Flo-
rence portrayed unrealistically an overly angry and sar-
saroastlo Betsey, who in the nole was angry out of a
stronger feeling of discontent. Alexandra was perhaps
900 embarassed to properly develop Melissa a sexually
insatiable mman. and portrayed merely Melissa's
boredom whichrubbed off onto the audience.

how crestfalien wa' -person.pan-be-

Such was,the case regarding Ars _

Antiqua’s Monday night production
of 'D'ante’s' '“Divine' Comedy." The

hopes? .The hopes were-mine, and ,

a finefirst created them‘.

Beautiful Music
The music, which was primarily
a mood initiator, was beautiful. It
was almost perfectly formed by the
smooth coordination of a soprano
voice, Nancy Foster; a mezzo so-

prano, Marjorie Rivingston; and an -

unfortunately weak tenor, Martin:
Lies.

These three were often appro-
priately intertwined with a lute,
recorders, a tenor v-lol, an organ,
and a viola. This mixture had the
musty air of an imagined Middle

Ages and the attitude was near per-n

fact.

The dancers, Patty Hoines, Skip
Boxall, and Jerry Scott, were on the
whole, superb. The impressions in
Hell of Agony and futility were
nearly always clearly conveyed. The
moods (if-Purgatory and Paradise
were wanker, but also consistently
clealz. - .'
Fault oi Actors

The: disappointment came pri-
marily us a fault of the actors.
Michael Miller, as incuamned Latin
poet, Virgll, was weak throughout.
One cannot conceive such abrilltant
poet as being dull; however, Miller
was dull in Iioll, dull in Purgatory,
and dull at the entrance of Para-
dise (thank goodness they wouldn't
let him in there).

Lloyd lJuttista was unquestionably
brilliant as the "souls and spirits.”
At one time in the Inferno, as one
of the tortured souls, Battista com-
pletely captivated the audience and
dropped them into total silence with
a flawless sollloquy. Ballistn canbe
criticized in one respect only. Try
as he could, he was unable to re-
move an aura of the modern world
which pervaded his voice, his style,
and his comparatively uncontrol-
lable appearance.

One Act

Of the play had only one act,
Leonard Hicks as Dante. and the

play would.have succeeded. Hicks
was eloquent and emotionally
charged, too 'highly charged for the
first .act.; Hicks began-too strongly, '
reached his climax late in the first
act, and when he entered Paradise,
where his climax of joy and emotion
should have taken place; he col-
lapsed. . ‘ ‘

tCons‘idcring the power of the first.
act, it was inevitable that the play
,would fallfdurlng the second.

It was during the second act that "
I realized there were no lovers of
Dante's writing in the audience,
because I saw no rivers of tears
flow through the aisles. The play
created a feeling of indifference in
Purgatory, and about as much joy
‘in Paradise as there is in a funeral
dirge. '

Hicks performed in Paradise with
the some arrogance that he dis-
played ln the remainder of the pro-
duction, seemingly without the reali-
zation that the real Dante would;,-_
probably have felt humility and awe
in the presnece of Divinity.

I should have left at the inter-
mission.
