meant he was giving up basketball for good.

on. ‘ 'r

One incredulous reporter, recalling that ,UCLA,
Michigan, Ohio State, and a number of other big-time
basketball schools had offered Leyvrbdmboard, tui-
tion, spending money, and numerousi‘o‘ther benefits

w-to play ball for them. asked the powerhouse what
Albany had offered him.
Generous Otters

“Well,” Lew began, “they told me I had the rare
opportunity, of being accepted‘ihtqﬁlbany just-vonfthe
basis of my marks: that is, if Lotti?E ,Fenoughlithimy
Regents Scholarship exam. Well, i" llwon a. Regents
Scholarship, and if I went to any of those othérksghools
I would have to forfeit it. Also, I? badge chanceiffor a

When asked what else in the way "Off finfanciaLaid
Albany had promised him, Lew answered, '-‘I was'of-
fered a job of guarding the school’s equipment shack.
I am told that with a gas lantern, I"c'an geta lot of
studying done there. My pay? Oh, $1.10 an hour.”

Lew went on to say that he intencied to major in
Physics, citing the fine academic facilities at Albany
as another reason for his decision to attend there.

, “Getting back to basketball.” one reporter stated,
“What kind of athletic facilities does the schoolhave?”

"The Washington Avenue Armory, where State plays
its home games, is the latest in basketball ingenuity.
No other school has offered me a playing court that
was sufficiently soft enough - the Reserves march on
the floor every week - so that I would not be injured
in a fall. After all, when you fall from where I am,
you’ve got to be careful. Also, after I get fitted for my
glasses the coach told me I’d have a field day on the
Armory rims.”

Growing tired of answering the seemingly endless
line of questions. Lew said, “Gentlemen, I think an

“overall statement on why I chose Albany would save us
both a lot of wasted time.”

“What i liked most about Albany recruit techniques
was their honesty. They came out and told me they had
nothing to offer me’, and, by golly, they meant it.

“But Albany offered far more than financial aid.
They offered me a chance to grow with the school,”
explained the 7-foot giant, “a chance to be a large part
of their transitional movement."

As the reporters shufﬂed out of the press conference
amid an air of disbelief. a conversation between two of
the more outspoken scibes went something like this:

“I guess it doesn’t pay to offer athletes anything."

Education School

Accorded Money
For Program Addition

The School oi Education at the
State University of New York at Al-
bany has received a $20,000 grant
from the United States Office of Ed-
ucation to support the establishment
of a series of programs in special
education designed to train presently
certified teachers to teach emo-
tionally disturbed children in special
classrooms, individual therapy, and
in special groups in regular class-
rooms.

ln announcing the proposed mas-
ters degree program, Randolph
Gardner, dealt of the School of Edu-
cation, said the program should take
slightly more than one year of grad-
u-tie work. ,

The new program will be offered
through the Department of Educa-
tional Psychology, but will form a
nucleus of more comprehensive spe-
cial education work to be developed
subsequently.

Course and clinical work will be
taken with members of the Univer-
sity faculty working in conjunction
with members of the faculty of the
Albany Medical College and the
Study Center for Learning Disabili-
ties. It will deal with physical and
emotional problems, as well as
basic education in the field.

Fur-ilty Being Sought

Several new rill anu part-time
faculty members” are being sought
to work in this program. *

Dean Gardner said, "the Univer-
sity anticipates the development of
a department of special education
with the School of Education. It will
start with the emotionally handi-
capped because of the need reflected
3y the Legislature’s recent pro-
vision for such children.

“Research, as well as training
will be stressed.”

The School of Education has also
announced that it will sponsor an
institute on College instruction in
conjunction with the State Univer-
sity Agricultural and Technical Col-
lege at Delhi for the faculty at
Delhi.

The institute will run until May
1. It consists of a ten-meeting ser-
ies of lectures and discussions of
the two year college.
