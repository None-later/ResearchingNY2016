under the direction of Dr. Vincent
Schaefer. .

Park authorities feel that the new
geyser is more of'scientific inter-
est than tourist because of the long
intervals between eruptions.

The expedition to the park is an
annual event and was first organized
by Dr. Schaefer in 1981.

During the trip various experi-
ments were conducted relating to
the ecology of the area, the study of
atmospheric aerosis, and natural
patterns particular to' the area' are
conducted.‘

Dr. Schaefer said that "one ofthe
most stimulating experiences on‘
these expeditions is the getting to
gether of scientists. in various fields

 

world, who work with each other in
small groups."

other University personnel par-
ticipating in the expedition are Aus-
