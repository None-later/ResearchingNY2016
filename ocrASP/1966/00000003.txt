THIS UNUSUAL CIRCULAR architectural mosaic by Mr. Clark
is a collection at wood and metal pieces. A child's head is
imbedded in the circle oil tram the center at 4:00. The use of
metal and wood objects dominates the space of the work, but
the use at letters and commercial symbols draws the attention
of the viewer away irom the larger circles. The use of the soil-
boats and the repetition oi the word "Awake" provide contrast.

President Evan R. Col—
lins has organized the Art
Co-ordination Committee
for the New Campus. The
committee has already ar-
ranged for the hanging of
nine works of art in the-
U-lounge.

The committee is responsible for
studying the need for works of art
on the new campus. Their hope is
to include paintings, Sculpture and
morals.

Chairman Gregg

lieaded by Mrs. Lois ll. Gregg,
associate dean of students, the com-
mittee has already begun work on
the problem of finances. Tile state’s
budget to the State University has
never included appropriations for
decoration or athletics.

Dr. Clifton C. Thorne,Vice Pres-
ldellt for Student Affairs, is allleln-
ber of the committee. He has beell
working with organizations and
alumni to increase their support of
the University. Mrs. Helen Relillan
is the committee’s representative
from the Alumni Assoriation.

In its initial effort, the conlulit-
tee contacted Edward Cowley, A.
William Clark and Thom O’Connor
of the SUNYA artdepartlnent. These
faculty members have loaned three
works each. Seven of the worksllave
been hung in the U-lounge ill the
Dutch Quadrangle. Two prints by
Mr. O’Connor are being framed.

If the reaction to the works is
favorable, steps will be taken to
purchase these items.

Artists

Cowley. the cllalrlllan of the art
department, has degrees inart from
the Albright School of Art, SUNY
College at Buffalo, and Columbia
University. lie has also studied at
Cornell and the National College of
Art ill Dublin.

He has paintings in the perma-
nent collections at the Albany ln-
stitute of History and Art, Sche-
nectady Museum, Slnltll College Mu-
seum, Munson-Proctor Institute,

Colgate University Gallery and
Berkshire Museum.

O’Connor has degrees from Flor-
ida State University and Cranbrook
Academy of Art. lie has specialized
ill prints, although he has all oil
painting hanging in the U-lounge.
His latest show was at the Silvall
Silnoue Gallery in L05 Angeles.0ne
of his prints has been purchased
recently by the Museum of Modern
Art ill New York City.

Clark is a graduate of Alfred
University and holds a degree ill
industrial ceramic design. He has
won prizes lll ceramic exhibitions,
recently first prize ill mosaics at
a Wichita, Kansas exhibition.

Goals and Ideas

The committee has held meetings
to plan the scope of its overall

goals. Many lounges, formal andlll-
formal, and many layers lllust be
decorated to break up the neutral
colors of the walls, ceilings and
floors.

Mrs. Gregg has said that she
hopes all students and faculty ill-
terested ill art should contribute
their ideas to any committee mem-
ber. These ideas may be resources
of art or money, different types of
art that lnlgllt be included, etc.

The teaching faculty members of
the committee are Mr. Peter Bene-
dict, Mrs. Vlolet Laruey and Mr.
John C. Overbeck.

Tlle students on the committee
are Roger French and Elizabeth
Mickel. Col. Walter Tisdale, As-
sistant to the President for Plan.
ning and Development is also on
the committee.

Ideas

The size of the new campus is
such that millions .of dollars could
be spent if it were to be thoroughly

. decorated. The problem of ploneyis
a constant one, DllL'\Ml‘§.  also
stated that there 15‘ ills‘problem that
the art works could beallodge pudge
without atther unity or overall
beauty.

The style of decorating the U-
loullge will probably prevail
throughout the campus -- large
spaces will be broken up with art,
but the walls will not be crowded

Building Better Bridge ‘

by Harry Nuckols

This Sunday, Feb. 13, a portloll of
the Intercollegiate Par-Point Bridge
Championship will be held ill Uru-
bacller. All over the country, thou-
sands of college students, from ex-
pert to back, will be playing a setof
hands made up for them by the na-
tional directors of the game.

A par-point game presents an
opportunity for a partnership totest
its skill and to learn a great deal ill
the process. Today‘s hand, taken
from a pl‘eVlUllS game, is typical of
par hands.

Prescribed Contract

The filial contract is sound. Any
slam colltracl must be played by
South ill order to protect the club
holding. The opening lead is pre-
scribed by the tournamentdirectors
in order to keep this variable call-
stant (the contract is also prescribed
regardless of what contract is ac-
tually bid.)

As you can see, if West leads the
club ace, sin no trump is a piece of
cake, and any other club will allow
South to make seven. So West is
directed to lead the diamond ten.

From this point on, Southis on his
own. He wins the lead and plays the
king of hearts and a high spade.’l‘he
majors are not going to split, But
this means that East started with
only three cards in the minors.

Ploy horn Weak Hand
80 South now plays his remain-
ing diamonds, and East must throw
his club to protect his holding in
the majors. New South should cash
the heart queen and play the heart

eight. East must now part with one
of his high hearts so that South can
not take a double finesse.

South should win the heart ill his
hand and cash his remaining spade
winners. This should leave the
dummy with a small spade and the
two clubs, East with the ten-six of
hearts and the high spade, and South
with the jack-seven of hearts and
the club king.

All South has to do now is to lead
the dumlny’s last spade alld discard
his club. East now has the lead and
must give South the last two tricks
in hearts. Easy enough when you see
it, bllt tough at the table.
