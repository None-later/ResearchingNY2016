first :g'ive; a firsthand count of oneiof the high points

  

of every basketball schedule. the annual alumni game._

, Former State University News sports andheadeditor
Bill Cohanyvatcheti the grade do battle with the frosh
at the Armory on Saturday. February 5. in a “contest”
preceding the Brooklyn College encounter. Here is what
Bill had to say: ’

“Dick Crossett didn’t look exactly eaten up by old
age, and in fact he looked almost better than ever. The
combo of Crossett and (Dan) Zeh is still one of the most
potent forces to be seen on local basketball courts.

“The alumni team sprang no surprise by starting
last year’s varsity squad en toto; the alumni won easily.
' "Because the game took place during intersession,
'the usually large crowd was held to aminimum. Only
about 300 fans attended this game and the ensuing game
with Brooklyn College. 1

“Funny things happen in alumni-type games. Assis-
tant frosh coach Marty Eppner found himself playing
against his own charges. Eppner teaches well. On one
play, a frosh batted the coach’s attempt at a lay-up
back down and almost knocked Eppner’s head off.

“Most of the alums played for fun, but one, Don Co—
hen, seemed to be taking the proceedings pretty ser-
iously. He seemed irked at his teammate’s sloppy play
in the closing minutes .of the game, and at the final
buzzer he walked off the court without looking back.

“The alumni game can put your mind through sharp
changes. Who would have thought that the PA would
ever announce ‘Mert Sutherland (frosh coach two years
ago and player even longer ago) in for Dick Crossett.
Almost as stirring as the scheduling of the game
itself.”

. Why the poor scheduling? Athletic Director Merlin

,, "Hathaway explained it as follows:

‘bYW‘The sports schedule is made up at least one year,
sometimes two. in advance. Last year this year’s
schedule was made up before the school’s social cal—
endar was changed to accommodate for the anticipated
move from the old to the new campus. It was easier
to honor the contracts than to try and weasel out. We‘
are very sorry for the development, especially with
the games having to be played during exams.”

Well, it’s been that kind of year. What next?

After the passage of the
bill, the bill was found to be
unconstitutional because
the bill directs 'MYSKANIA

ltaiiter than postpone the elec-
'lllills, an amendment was proposed
and brought to the student body for
passage yesterday. This amendment
will not affect the dates of appli-
cation, election oi‘ inauguration, un-
less it is not passed.

Student Tax

At the beginning of the ilieeiing,
Richard Thompson, Central Council
President, announced that 8692 of

German Club, Fencing Club, For-

When asked for his reaction to
the student body response to the
tax, Richard Thompson said, “I
am very pleased with the turnout
and l thliik it is indicative, of two
things: 1) the quality of the pro-
gram and 2) it demonstrates the
general student body’s desire to see
the activity of the University con-
tinued and progress."

   
 
 

Student Tait-Paid"By~-
"Activities Not Affected

The statistics on the
number of people who have
paid their student tax this
semester indicate that the
financial loss will not be
great enough to prevent
absorption by the budget
this year.

86 per cent of the student body,
including graduate students, has paid
the fees.

Approximately $40-50,000 have
been collected. Richard Thompson,
Central Council President, saidtliat
the affect on Student Association
activities will be negligible. He
expressed the hope that organiza-
_« .. 2 tlons realize that the Association is
working with decreased revenues.

The groups, therefore, should ex-
ercise prudence when plaiiningtheir
expenditures. It is also necessary
that all organizations offer total
cooperation in preventing non-SA
members from participating in ac-
tlvlties.

Central Council is considering
certain legislative measures which
will assist the organizationsinlheir
regulation of non-SA members,

Being considered is ilie associated
Student Association membership
which will cover students who did not
pay the tax but participate in non-
aciivities. It will put those who
are not concerned with SA activities
under the Jurisdiction of SA rogu-
laiiniis.

The reasons for so many students

grain. The program itself demon-
strates its worth through its obvious
functions.

The cooperation of the various
offices also aided the popularity of
the program. The Student Associa-
tion Office, the Business Office and
the Financial Aids Office made it
easy for students, who might find
it difficult, to pay.
