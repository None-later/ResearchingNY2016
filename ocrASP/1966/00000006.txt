looking and leaping

The first major “goof” of Central
Council took place at its meeting Thurs-
day when an election bill was passed and
then found to be unconstitutional. it
seems that preparations were made for
the MYSKANIA elections and inaugura-
tion.

However, it was found that the Student
Association constitution states that
MYSKANIA elections must take place in
March. In order to remedy this situation
it was proposed that a special referen-
dum be held to make it constitutional to
hold MYSKANIA electionsin February.

There is no excuse for this mistake.
Election commission should have
"looked before they leaped.” This meth-
od of ramroding through a constitutional
amendment without, giving the student
body prior notice is not the way to run-
a student government.

Nevertheless, we feel that in order
to avoid causing more confusion, the.
student body should vote in the affirma-
tive in this referendum.

Critical lest to Come

With the final tabulations almost in,
it appears that about 85 per cent of the
student body has paid the student tax.
This relatively high figure means that
the activities of Student Association will
be able to function at near capacity.

The reason for so many students pay-

ing their tax, we feel, can be attributed
to the job done by certain members of
Central Council who worked on the pro-
ject of orienting the student body on the
advantages of student tax and convincing
them to pay it.

However, even with these results we
are apprehensive about the results for
next semester. After a summer recess
student memories are short and many
might forget what student tax pays for.

Since many students pay their fees
over the summer or within the first
days of the semester they will not be
subjected to the enormous publicity pro-
gram which Was carried on the latter
part of last semester.

We feel that this time will be the
critical 'test of student support for Stu-
dent Association. We hope that the rev-
enue from student tax will not decrease
but we feel that if the case should arise.
new sources of revenue should be sought.

Necessary Action

At the Central Council meetingThurs-
day a motion was passed changing the
method of paying salaries to students.
Under this new system salaries will be
paid in two week installments as opposed
to a lump sum paid at the beginning of
the semester.

Reluctantly we have to agree with this
action because we feel it is a necessary
safeguard against someone drawing a
salary at the beginning of the semester
and then quitting his position before the
semester is over.

Compliments Analysis

To the Editor:

For some time i have wanted to
,state my appreciation to your edi-
torial staff for ihe‘insights and the
analysis which were offered on the
Art-in-Science exhibit when it
opened at the Albany institute of
liistory, and Arbi'n October.

As Co-Chalrman of tire Exhibit
and as the person responsible for
collecting most of the material I
was,vei'y grateful for your review
when it was printed bebause it
recognized the'exhibit'as an ex-

periment in liberal education, in- '

volving the relationships between
the so-called two cultures.

More importantly, however, was
the fact that you saw in the exhibit
the meaning which we intended,
namely, that both the scientist and
the artist have a sense of beauty
and work with it in their dailyllves,
despite the fact that the origins of
the beauty are to some degree dif-
fercrit.

Your statement was one of the
pioneer statements. You should be
pleased to know that it has been
since endorsed by Robert Coates,
the art critic for the New Yorker
magazine, Alfred lr'rankenstein, the
art critic on the West coast for the
San Francisco Chronicle, the Sci-
ence editor for the San Francisco
Chronicle, by the runny thousands of
people that have slur-e viewed the
exhibit and perhaps most significant
new by the fact that the Smithsonian
institution has taken over the Arl-
iii-Science exhibit and plans to cir-
culate it as a national travelling show,
available to colleges, universities
and other public institutions across
the country during the heir several
years.

At this time, i have l'ofllintéis from
liarvurri University, iron. :E... lint-
varrl Medical School, the iiosiun Li-
brary, the Union Carbide Caryn,

logcs of lite State University of

igan, the University of iown, the

it is very easy to offer a compil-
ment after the fact. In your case,
I recognize the originality of the
analysis which you made and com-
pliment you on the soundness oi
the analysis of the meaning of the
