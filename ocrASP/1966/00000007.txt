University

MARIANNA A. POLTORATZKY, a leading Russian scholar,

 

  
 
 
  

 

 

will join the Albany faculty in September, I966, to inaugurate
the new Master's program in Russian.

M.A. Degree in Russian

Offered By

by Mal Provost

A master of arts degree
in Russian, the first to be
given in the SUNY system,
will be offered by the Uni-
versity Russian depart—
ment in September, 1966.

For the degree a minimum of 18
hours of Russian is required and
appi'oxiniaiely 12 hours of support-
ing courses are ativised.Tuliion will
be $000 for the academic year.

To complete the graduate level
program five new. courses will be
available next year. These include
advanced syntax, Russian literary
history in 1800, Pushkin, a sem-
inar mid a masters thesis in Rus-
slan.

Courses Presently Taught

i-‘onr cuni'sos presently being
taught are available to seniors for
advanced standing. All courses lead-
ing to the masters degree will be
taught in Russian, consequently a
working knowledge of the language
is necessary for advanced work.

Research facilities to supplement
the program are expected to be rcttdy
in time for the first classes. The
library has purchased over two
thousand items including all the
Russian classics, twnencyclopedias
and il dictionary oi ancient Russian.

Presently ten students are ex-
pected to be enrolled this Septem-
ber. it is hoped that the growing
demand for Illiﬁnliill scholars and
teachers will ill‘lIW students from
the entire country.

Loading Russian Scholar

To compensate for the additional
touching lilll‘illlii of a masters pru-
griim, Murinnnu .-\. Poltoraizky has
accepted a position on the Univer-
sity's inculty.

Professor l’olinriitzky, one of the
loading Russian scholars and edu-

University

cators of the academic world, is
presently teaching at Vassar Col-
lege and is chairman of the Rus-
sian department. She will begin
teaching at Albany in September.

Poltoratzky received Ph.D.’s
it‘om the State University of Lenin-
grad iii 1936 and from the State
University of Graz, Austria in 1946.
In addition to this she has studied
at Columbia, Vassar and the Uni-
versity of California at Salt Jose.

Taught in Russia
She taught in Russia and Austria
until she came to the United States
in 1951. She has written 20 books
and numerous magazine articles.

 

FEBRUARY 18, I966

Consideration of the
problems created by avol~
untary student tax marked
the first meeting of the
Student Tax Committee on
Tuesday night.

The committee’s only official ac-
tion was to exempt the Albany Stu-
dent Press from checking that stu-
dents have paid their student tax
before allowing them to take a copy
of the paper.

Under official student tax policy
passed by Central Council, “Stu-
dent membership, participation, or
holding office in any group or ac-
tivity financed in whole or in part
by Student Association shall be con-
tingent upon payment ofStudetit tax.”

Thus, theoretically, a student
would have to show his tax card
before taking advantage of any ac-
tivity, program, publication, or
service provided by Student Asso-
ciatlon.

Policy Unenforceable

As in the case of the newspaper,
however, this policy would beiiiglily
difficult to enforce in some iii-
stances. Special events and some of
the programs ‘xfinanced by Student
Association, for example are tra-
ditionally open without charge to all
members of the university and even
to members of the outside commun-

.-.

1'.

While this practice was feasible
when all students paid the tax, it
would now violate the tax policy.
Special exemptions such as the ASP
received would have to be given by
the committee.

Non-Budgetary Groups
The committee also considered
the status of religious groups, aca-
demic honornries, department
clubs, and Greeks. All of hiese

groups participate in the govern-
ment but do not receive budgetary
funds.

The suggestion was made that
members of these groups be re-
quired to pay student tax in order
for the group to participate in gov-
ernment.

The idea was considered unleas-
ible since many religious groups
contain constitutional provisions
that all members of that faith are
automatically members of the or-
ganlzailoii.

The‘ Academic Affairs Commis-
sion has passed aresolution to make
payment of student tax it require-
ment for membership in its organi-
zations. It is hoped that other com-
missions and organizations will in-
clude this provision.

The committee plans to send a
letter to each organization head
which will explain the provisions of
the tax and contain suggestions on
how each organization can cooper-
ate iii getting full paymentoi‘thetax.

Athletic Assessment

The relation of the Athletic As-
sessment to the student tax was
another problem mentioned. Four
alternatives were offered for. con-
sideration:

1. putting athletics entirely un-
der student finance and control.

2. putting athletics entirely Ull-
der State finance and control.

3. retaining the present sysrein
of combining student tax and atiiletic
assessment with student finance and
control by President Collins.

4. retaining control by President
Collins but assessing students sep-
arately for student tax and for ath-
letics.

There has been little discussion as
yet on this issue. Other matters dis-
cussed included the possibility of
paying the tax later inthe semester.
This would allow a student to par-
ticipate in an activity he had not
previously intended to join. The tax
for graduates will also be analyzed.
