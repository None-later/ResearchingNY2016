_ Giaen Accreditation

_ The School of Library Science of
State University of New York at Al-
bany was granted accreditation by
the American Library Association
.at its mid-winter meeting in Chi-
cago. The ALA based its decision
'on a favorable report filed byateam
representing ' the ' Association’s
Committee on Accreditation which
.had visited the school last Novem-
-ber. - .

The three-man group, composed
of Dr. Leon Carnovsky, University
of Chicago; Dr. Andrew Osborn,
?UnivTeT"s'it,_‘gf_ Pittsburgh; and H.
Gordon Behanan, Harvard Univer-
sity, was particularly concerned
with how the School of Library Sci-
ence had'adapted tothe change in en-
vironment, from that of State Col-
lege for Teachers to State Univer-
slty.

The two major changes in the
School of Library Scrence that are
expected as a result of national
accreditation are an increase in the
number of full-time students, and
an increase in the number of ap-
plications from outside New York
State.

Mixed Marriage

To Be Discussed
By Studentsﬁlﬂﬂ

An'informal discussionon "Mixed
Marriage” and other topicsofinter-
est to the college student will be
held this Saturday afternoon from
3:00 pan. to 4:00 p.m. and Satur-
day afternoons thereafter, in either
the Commons or in the Faculty Din-
ing Room. "

The informal discussions, open
roythe entire University, are the re-
sult ‘of a need to discuss problems
related to the cbliege student which
has been detected by a group of
seniors. 

Topics to follow will include
“Birth Control" and “Education and
Marriage.” Saturday discussions
will be led by students who have
investigated the problems of mixed
marriage and may be followed up
by a discussion of the same topics
by a priest, a minister and a rabbi.

If the discussions are successful,
it is hoped that students will con-
tribute their own topics for disaus-
sions.

Exchange Student
Author 0i Novel

Many students and faculty know
that we have Foreign Students on
our campus -— sixty-seven to be
exact, but few realize that among
these are some outstanding per-
sonalitles.

One of our visitors, Mohammad
Yadegari, is an author who has
published a book in his home coun-
try, irau. A physics major here,
Yadegarl wrote the novel “Delirium
of n Melanchollt' Man" when he was
almost eighteen.

in describing the book, he said,
"I followed the style of Gogol lll his
"Memories of to Crazy Man” and
the thoughts of Nietzrh‘e in his
“'l‘luis Spoke Zarathustra."

Most ill the published copicswerc
t'tl‘Cllltlteil among the students at the
University of Tehran who revolved
it with mixed reactions.

According to Yadegarl, "Sumo
called it atlleisttr, some rnllcd it
anti-religious, some called it ab-
surd, and sonnet-oiled” 'tbe facts'."
Told in the first person by a young
mun suffering from disilluslomuent
and anger, the book is a general
criticism oi the daily life of Pet'-
sians, their beliefs and rustoms.

lie has wrulcn several other books
which hate not yet been published

divided into quarters each year with
a summer session at the end of the
first year.

in the first year, the student con-
centrates on thebasic sciences while
being introduced to the professional
courses: Principles and Practices of
Physical Therapy, Theory and Tech-
nique of Physical Therapy, Tests and
Measurements, and Introduction to
and Participation in Clinical Skills.

The Journal Club and Seminar
further demonstrate, through pro-
fessional journals, publications,and
discussion, the role of the profes-
sion. In Organization and Adminis-
tration the student learns about the
operation and function of the pro-
fession in various settings through
which the patient is served.

During the second year, the stu-
dent concentrates on developing
knowledge and skill in Clinical Ana-
tomy, Theory and Technique of
Physical Therapy, and Tests and
Measurements. lie also learns about
personality changes that affect pa-
tient and family, his function in the
community and how to cope with
these circumstances.

An attempt is made to stimulate
inquiry and creativity as well as
giving the student an fippOi‘iUlliij' to
develop a basic knowledge in the
techniques of expression. The total
curriculum objectives and achieve-
ments are then applied as he prac-
tires the learned techniques in the
appropriate environment.

During this cllmrul experience
he is being etaluated by the faculty
and staff lll order in identlly and
strengthen any weaknesses and im-
prove hts effectiveness. The prur-
tlcal experience will also pl‘m'lrle
