I 'We have foun‘ 'itfincr‘ea’singly burdensome to try and
adequately caver,_S_tate sports with semi-weekly reg-
ularity. And now that the winter sports seasonis nearly
over, a long lull occurs until the spring season gets
underway. Also. with the threat of rain-outs omni-
3 present in the springtime, coming out with a Tuesday
issue as well as a Friday one wouldbe most distasteful
and highly precarious. ..

x , And so we say a not-so-fond adieu to Tuesday’s
sports-page with one final request: will those of you
who have thought of writing sports for the ASP please
direct'your thoughts toward more academic pursuits,
Afterallrthatfswhat we’re here for, isn’t it?

In Wednesday afternoon’s wrestling match with RPI,
Coach Joe Garcia’s wrestling team showed what it was
made of — pure hustle and desire. We watched in awe
as talented» Warren Crow exhibited his enormous skills
in easily pinning his 130 pound foe in a minute and a
halfyﬁiiere is one wrestler really worth giving up a
Wéékday afternoon to watch perform.

‘ We saw Mike Poplaski dominate his 137 pound match,
\ finishing it with an injured eye. Randy Palmer really
had his: work cut out for him as he squeaked out a 2-0
win in' a very evenly matched contest. And there was
Mike Goldych. wrestling a class above his own weight
andhgrappling with a fine RPI wrestler, valiantly stave
off being. pinned; realizing that such an occurrence
would mean defeat for the Danes.

,_ Art Recesso looked very impressive in scoring a pin
at 4:29. Art has been a steady performer for the team
all year, and we saw why Wednesday. Finally there was
Dick Szymanslci, all 177 pounds of him, fighting off a
tribuntain of an RPI man. 250 pounds of muscle, in the
heavyweight division to earn State a tie in the match.

 , Ploilsburgh Tops Danes

Capers to Vie With “3

Powerful Plattsburgh State, utilizing its height ad—
vantage and successful fast-breaks, overwhelmed the
Great Danes of Albany State, 79—54. Tuesday night,
before a capacity crowd at the Washington Avenue Ar-
mory. Next game for the hoopsters is tomorrow night,
when the face the Buffalo Bulls in an away contest.

Tom Chapin, a six-foot,
five-inch Little All-Amer-
ica, and All-ECAC the last
four weeks, .was the big
thorn in the State attack,
as he scored 23 points and
collected 19 rebounds.

The Cardinals led 23-12 in the
first half when the Danes suddenly
caught fire and outscored Piatts-
burgh 15-2 to take the lead 27-25.
But this was the only lead the
Sauersmen had in the entire game,
as the visitors took 35-29 lead, and
went into the locker room with a
37-32 advantage.

At the start of the second liaif,

 Cards ripped all nine straight
poniis to take a commanding 46-32
edge, and for all intents and pur-
poses, that was it.

Bloom Loads Scaring
Mike Bloom led the State scoring

with 15 points. Other double-figure
scorers were Mike Crocco wiili 14
and Larry Marcus with 12. Lonnie
Morrison had six, Jim Constantino,
Tom Doody, and Marty O;Donnel two
each and Tim Jursak one to end the
scoring for the cagers.

Besides Chapin’s 23, Bill Rankin
hit for 12, and John Harrison and
Tom Gebo 10 each, to pace the 13-3
Cardinals.

State is now 10-7 on the year and
has one home game remaining, which
is this Wednesday night againsiNew
Paliz.

Frosh Boot LaSolcttc
The State irosh evened their rec-
ord at 0-6 with a thrilling 74-08
victory over LaSalette Seminary.
The game was tied at 64-h]! when
Rich Mai'gison scored a field goal
and Vic Conn, Gary Torture, and Bill
Moon free throws in the last minute

to put the game out of reach.

T 2: Seek liYSKANIA, 
Six Named Outstanding!“-

Central Council and MY SKANIA resolved their differ-,-

dances Saturday when they met in special joint session

to approve a revised list of twenty-one candidates for. '

fourteen members.

The committee met Fri-
day after Central Council
and MY SKANIA had failed
to approve concurrentlythe
original list of nominees
submitted as specified by
the election bill. '

MYSKANIA

Traditionally, MYSKANIA recom-
mends outstanding candidates to the
student body. This selection is based
on the criteria listed in the MYS-
KANlA constitution: leadership, re-
liability, good judgment, contribu-
tions to the university, initiative
and scholarship. ’

Approve list After Controversy

Nominations for MYS-
KANIA was the major issue
presented at the Central
Council meeting Thursday
night. William Cleveland

the 19 nominees.

This list has been reduced from
81 to 10 names by the screening
committee. it had been established
that the complete list must be ap-
proved hy both Central Council and
MYSKANIA before being presented
to the student body.

At the Central Councilmeetingihe
list was unanimously approved.
However, at a MYSKANIA meeting
Thursday night, the list was re-
jected with questions raised.

Reasons Explained

The reasons for this rejection
were explained by MYSKANIA chair-
man Al Smith. “First of all, MYS-
KANlA felt that there was a great
deal of discrepancy between those
nominated and those deleted from
the list.”

“It felt that some of the people
left off the list did meet the stand-
ards set by the committee. MYS-
KANlA also thought that the com-
mittee was, too severe in several
instance in its evaluation. Perhaps
more of the final decision should be
left to the voters," said Al Smith.

As a result the list was returned
to the screening committee and re-
vised. lt was expanded from 10 to
21 names. When it was submitted
to a joint session of Central Coun-
cil and MYSKANIA Saturday, it was
passed 20--4--4.

Smith also said, "I fii‘mlybollove
that a screening committee for MYS-
KANIA nominations is a stop in the
right direction. Although i do not
believe that it is the complete answer
to the question, in all fairness to
future candidates the procedure
must be re-evaiuaied.”

“As the candidates for MYSKANIA
become more select, MYSKANIIA as
a body cannot help but make lasting
and worthwhile contributions to the
University."

The 2.5 semester average pre-
sently required for the Supreme
Court Justices was also discussed
at the Central Council meeting
Thursday night. Robert Petersen
read a statement prepared by the
Commission for Academic Affairs
that supported the maintenance of
a 2.5 average.

The statement pointed out that
the aim of MYSKANIA and Central
Council is to provide the best pos-
sible judicial system. Governmental
rather than academic purposes were
cited as the reasons for this over-
age, and it would be illogical to
tolerate less than this.

According to the statement, this
average should be an “unquestioned
necessity." It continued in its sup-

port of the existing ruling as it
stated that membership standards
should not be less than those re-
quired for entrance into that or-
ganization.

The Living Area Affairs Commis-
sion reported that the Key System
had been proposed for experimenta-
tion on the Dutch Quad. This system
would allow girls to sign out the key
to the dorm in the early eveningand
return it by 6:00 a.m.

A committee was formed to fur-
ther discuss this system. After a
plan is formulated, it will be pre-
sented to a higher body for approval.

Richard Thompson announced the
resignations from Central Council
by two members. Mrs. Martha Egal-
sion will be replaced by Mr,Richard
Haussr while Lynn Kurth's place will
be taken by Judy Harjung.
