CﬂthlSM‘ Challenged
To the Editor:' 1

I would like- to correct Miss Som-
mervllle's attack on' Batman and de-
fine some of the terms which she
obviously misunderstood.

Before I progress let me give you
two definitions of “camp.” “Camp”
is a third stream of taste, entirely
apart from good or bad taste. (Par-

‘ tisan Review).

“Camp” is anything pleasantly
ostentatious (Eric Partridge). Bat-
man isdeflnltely not high camp.
'High camp can only be applied to
those things which were not meant
to be camp such as Virginia Woolf's
"Orlando" or Marlene Dietrich as
in “The Devil Is a Woman.”

Batman is intentional camp that
which Is meant to be camp. Just as
Miss Barbra Streisand became a
sensation, partly due to her Inten-
tional camp actions, likewise Bat-
man is a success.

(I lmply no similarity between
Batman and the "Funny Girl")

Granted Batman Is not serious.
But how can anyorl: say that the
Dynamic Duo offers no comedy.
It’s just about the funniest show
in years.

I believe, along with quite a few
others who lune In the same Bat-
tlme and the same Bat station, 15
one of the funniest shows on the.
“Boob tube” and the disappearance
oi such shows as “Dick Van Dyke”
and " Honey West”would make room
for “Wonder Woman” and “Green
Hornet.”

Art Choices Dull

To the Editor:

A notice has been posted on bulle-
tin boards at the new quad to call
student attention to the art coordi-
nating committee for the new cam-
pus and Its fIrsI project, the lower
lounge at the Dutch Quad.

I think that the aim of this board
Is noble, although I would definitely
question its Judgment. ’I‘he reliefs
that have been hung are superb,
the palnlIngs undistlnguishcd. The
council has evidently decided to limit
itself to works of a contemporary
and abstract vein.

They say that the architecture
more or less dictates the typo of.
work to be displayed. Obviously,
they have no darlng or sense of
adventure. Their approach In that
of the dreary little housewife whose
house 15 of the colonial period, and
who consequently does all her decor-
atlng on a colonial motif ad nauseum.

It would be Infinitely more exciting
to see a few good museum prints In
older European styles darineg

    

framed (a baroque frame here or
there would break the monotony of
those walls) and hung side by side
with contemporary works.

. At the moment, I cannot think of
anything duller than a whole campus

they complement and enhance each
others beauty.

John Mormile, student'chairman
of the event and vice president of
the fraternity expects to, collect 400
pints of blood‘ from the University
community. and hopes sufficient. ad-
vance registrations will accumulate
by next week, to avoid seeking out-
side help to meet the quota.

of the approximately 100 com-
mitments so far, only four are
faculty members. All blood given
will be used by the Defense De-
partment, either In Vietnam or other
areas needing supply.

  

 

Members of the University com-i
munity are urged to/apply for up:-
polntments soon so that scheduling
for the 400 needed can be completed.

Registration

Registration Is to be completed
by March 1 with students 18-21
needing permission slips signed by
their parents. Details and applica-
tions are available from Mormlle.

The fraternity Is sponsoring the
blood drive to show their concern
for the fact that soldiers are dying
In Vietnam. The program is one
means through which such concern
can be expressed.

If any principle Is involved, the
brothers feel, It Is not one of en-
dorsement or disapproval of the
Ideology involved, but It Is centered
upon the fact that United States men
are dying.
