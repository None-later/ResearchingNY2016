Musical Biography
To Be Presented-
April 28-30 In Page

"Gypsy," the tenth annual State
University Revue, will be presented
this year on April 28-30, 1966, 'at
6:30 p.m. in Page Hall, according
to director John Fotia. Tickets, at
$1.75 apiece, will go on sale April
18 at the State University box office.

Fotia added that "Gypsy," the
musical biography of Gypsy Rose
Lee, requires a cast of about fifty.
The leads will be played by Carol
Rosenthal as Mama Rose, stage
mother par excellence, Carla Pi-
nelli, the “talentless’ Louise who
eventually attains stardom, and Joe
Nicastrl as Herbie, the agent who
loves Rose but cannot live with her
methods.

Three other essential roles filled
by a trio of sophomores. Judy Reil-
ly (as Tessie Tura),
(as Mazeppa), and Adele Preziosi
(as Electra) portray the three hard-
bitten strippers who start Louise
on her career as Gypsy Rose Lee.

The cast is unusual, he noted,
for the variety lt encompasses. It
includes Veterans of several re-
vues, as Well as those who will be
making their stage debut with this
show; their fields run the gamut
from music and theatre to math
and chemistry.

Joe Nicastri, who will play Her-
bie, is a newcomer to State stages;
the opposite is true of Carol Ro-
senthal, who plays his leading lady.
She had appeared in two reception
shows, and was also seen in last
year's “Damn Yankees.” Carla Pi-
nelll, who plays Louise, is cur-
rently belttg seen as Evie in “Stop
the World.”

John Fotia, the show's director,
is himself a seasoned veteran. His
first appearance at Albany was as
a freshman, when he was seen in
People, tlte ’64 Reception Show; it
was followed by roles in SUT pro-
ductions of “Ethan Frome" and
“Dr. Fant'us." lie was assistant
director to l.ee Liss for the ’65
revue, and, .rlth Helen Stoll, co-
chaired Pro-View '65.

He is assisted by Alexander Kra-
kower, also familiar to State aud-
iences, primarily for his work in
“Ethan Frome.” As technical di-
rector for Pre-View '65 and other
shows, he is also amply qualified
for the job.

In expanding the traditional two-
nlgltt run to three, Fotla has set
a new precdent, but one which he
feels is warranted not only by in-
creasing audiences, hut also by the
type of show being presented this
year.
