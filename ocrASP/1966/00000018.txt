Tomorrow night the Supreme Court
will sit in judgment ofthe constitutional-
ity of the MYSKANIA“ screening com-
mittee. We hope that the justices will
exercise maturity in making their de—
cision.

By maturity we mean they will not let
their personal bias or jealousies inter~
fere or influence their final decision. We
have already stated that two of the jus—
tices should disqualify themselves be-
cause they have a conflict of interest
but it appears that they will not adhere
to this.

However, it is the other justices that
we are apprehensive about. Several
members appear to have made up their
mind about the case without hearing the
evidence presented.

People with this attitude do not real-
; ize their responsibility and do notbelong
’ on the Court. They should not be blinded

 liours Proposal Sensible

We are very happy to see the proposal

\ for the change in women’s hours which

is now being considered. The plan is

one which will allow a much greater de-

gree of flexibility and freedom for the

residents. it will also give more re—
sponsibility to the residents.

The plan is now being given careful
consideration in committee. and from
all appearances, it is generating a great
amount of enthusiasm. The women of
Beverwyck and Schuyler are especially
enthusiastic. andare determiner] to prove
the plan’s worth.

by their own value judgments of those
nominees selected or those people who
were rejected by the Screening Com—
mittee.

Their only purpose is to review the
constitutionality of the Screening Com-
mittee.

The effectiveness ofthe Supreme Court
depends entirely on the justices who sit
on the bench. if they are not respected
the Court will not be respected.

Too often courts of the student body
become a farce because its members
are not objective in their position. We
would hate to see this happen to the
Court.

This will be the first case the Court
will hear and its actions and behavior
will set a precedent for the future and
determine the fate and usefulness of
the Court to the student body.

They, of course, will be the ones to
make the final decision as to whether or
not the plan will continue and extend to
all the dorms on campus.

The major obstacle at present seems
to be the number and variety of differ-
ent groups which must approve the pro-
posal before it can go into effect.

Therefore we urge those interested
to attend the meetings of the committee
where the proposal is now being care-
fully and extensively considered. This
will eliminate needless time wasting in
the future.

unieaiers rennin Alliance,

And It’s 'lill for

by Jane Schneider

Possibly you already have an in-
side on the way it is in this capital
city. Perhaps, on the other hand,
you are new to Albany.

Have you been confused by the
rumors about the city's ailing gov-
ernment? Are you shocked by such
symptoms as the condition of her
streets, the lack of city planning,
the horrifying slum problems, and
certain opportunity gaps?

In Albany, city government is
synonymous with two names, O'Con-
nell and Corning. For several rea-
sons, neither is overly plagued by
the symptoms of (city-living enu-
merated above. Each has decided
to reside ullttiifle the city-limits,
Dan O'Connell up in the Helder-
berg litOIllltﬂ'fiS and Erastus Corn-
ing, on Corning Hill in Glenmont.
It was not always so.

The name of Corning has long
been paid liar-or in Albany. Family
herilooins are on exhibit in the
Ten l)l'i)FCIi Mansion, located in the
heart of what is now alargely Negro
area called Arbor Hill. Mayor Corn-
lng’s father was arecognlzed,-lnflu-
ential figure in New York State pol-
itics and 'liltl various positions on
Capito' hill. Erastus' grandfather
hall a ilIlICt,‘ of Lieutenant Gov.
erim vi ire ntnte.

Liwid in South End

(iraiidfaiber Corning lived in what
was then a fashionable part of town,
the South End. Often he would stroll
down Smith Pearl Street and passthe
“the of day withainnn named O'Con-
ncil, the owner of a certain empor-
ium \‘.tvil’ll liquid refreshment was
sold.

v'-. warm, abiding friendship ex-
lsicd between the men. Several bonds
fostered ii. For one tiiiiig, they both
cared about their city and were op-
posed to the wretched Barnes nia-
chuie. Also, each of them had a
son; O’Connell's boy was just four
years younger than Corning's. That
son grew to become widely-known
as Uncle Dan.

As he was acquiring age and
knowledge, Dainty won Grandfather
(.‘ornliig’s admiration. Therefore,
when it came time for young Dan's
bid for a position of prominence in
the city's government, he was given
considerable backing by the older
gentleman.

Today the machine Dan O’Connell
hoisted into a longevity of over
forty years is suaver and also
partially guided by the grandson of
his primary backer, seven-time-
elocted mayor of Albany, Erastus
Corning.

Division of Powers

There is obviously a division of
powers and a well-defined line bo-
tweeti each man's domain.

Traditionally, city bosses get and
keep their titles through the intri-
cate entanglements of the patronage
system. The boss appoints henchmen
in each ward to receive callers---
conto-a-hcggln’.

In testimony to this, Albany has
the longest dole-roll known arty-
wliero for a city of this size. In
miniature the results look like this:

love of lllliany’

four men on a job, picking up snow
or leaves or grass; it's a ward
leader’s street most likely; one
shovels; two stand observing the
sky, and the fourth warms the sent
in the truck's cab.

Mayor's Role

A mayor’s role consists ingreet-
ing the more dignified scroliiigcrs,
as well as disinterested parties and,
liberally enough, even critics. In
the case of Mayor Corning, as Uni-ir-
Dan’s boys from his generation ago
along with him, the silver in their
hair puts slivers in their work output.

More and more, the mayor must
cover for Llilli with his well—norm
word, “No comment." Increasingly
he must straighten things out, sac
more and more critics, and illilt'iilr'
splits between departments as pa-
tience wears thin.

The mayor is an absolute polnb
cian. Many who know his capabil-
ities wonder his remaining in .ii-
bony with the numei‘ous Openings In
politics. Maybe the story of his
association with the big bosses has
‘sufficiently precluded him. (tr,
rather, might there have been a
family oath, a swearing in blood, a
pact of forefathers — all for a love
of Albany.

hopelessly idealistic, and of the
“communist - under - every -bod"
type of literature, perhaps more
aptly suited to tho wronged right-

(Ono might notice that the edi-
torial was released iii the Wash-
ington's birthday issue of the ASP).

The article makes Lanna dis-
play of statement, but wherein he

a few pertinent questions -- then
tell me social psychology can be
applied to the upheavors of water
fountains, and to the peoplc'who

know, but say nothing.

 

As for behavioral psychology when
dealing with an irrational and il-
logical and unfair procedures musi
be taken often in the form of it right
hand to the law or a kick to the
buttocks.

If, however, the person i'iitipuu-
slble is not apprehended, no punish-
ment other than that of group du-
privation can be incurred.

Building Better Bridge

by Harry Nuckols

Competitive bidding is a very ini-
portant and very often neglected
facet of the game of bride. Matty
players simply do not know what to
do when the opponents open the
bidding, or, for that matter, when
their side has opened the hand and
there has been an overcnll.

Take today's hand. East's bid is
obviously a “psychic.” Souihmakcs
a routine take-out double. West
makes a simple raise in his part-
nar’s suit (given a (iuubleton some-
where, West should probably bid
three hearts).

North now makes a cue bid. "But
where is his first round control?"
you ask. The answer is that North
doesn't used first round control in
hearts to make Ills cue bid. lie
doesn't need any control. All he
is saying is, "Partner, I have an
opening bid."

South is, of course, forced to
bid. So he nanies his best suit,
and silica North also has this suit,
he gladly bids the game.

The play is no problem. Since
the club finesse works, the defense
can collect only their two heart
tricks.

A good rule to follow when part-
nor makes a take-out doubts and
the next player passes: with 0-8
points, bid your best suit, with 9-
12 Points, jump in your best suit,

and with 13 or more points, cuc-
bld the opponent's suit.

fessor, said there are several rea-
sons: the siiow is camp, fire plot
is completely unpredictable and the
program venerates the irrational
and the absurd."

"Camp" is something nostalgic
or so ugly that it is ‘in’," McNall
said. “Batman fits the criterion in
that it calls forth visions of old
gangster movies, comic books and
a little bit of everyone’s childhood,
a childhood in which one wished
iiiiriself into the role of Superman,
Tarzan or any large-muscled hero
so that he could either fly away
from his parents, escape boredom,
win the love of the girl down the
block by performing fantastic deeds
or beat up the big kid who had been
picking on him.”

Trend In Society

Waller Gerson, assistant sociol-
ogy professor, who made a study of
the American comic book, reports
that there is “a trend in our su-
clety to the super-hero." He pre-
dicted the show should at least firi-
