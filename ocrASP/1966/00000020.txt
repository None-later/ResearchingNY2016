larger theatre Needed

An injustice will be performedfwhen only a limited
number of people will be able to see the State Univer-
sity Theatre’s production of “Stop the World, I Want to
Get Off."

This is due to the limited seating capacity of Rich-
ardson 290 where the play is to be performed.

This has been the case of many of the theatre’s
productions in the past. The most disheartening part
about this is that many of the people who attend these
performances are not members of the University.

Instead they are usually avid theatre goers from
the Albany area. We do not have a grievance against
allowing these people to attend the plays. This adds
to closer relationship between the University and the
outside community.

However, we do feel that since Student Association
money helps finance these productions. a large block
of tickets should be reserved for the student body. As
we have said, this has not been the casein the past.

This is especially necessary now that student tax is
a voluntary fee. The student body feels that they should
have priority in any activity which is financed with
their money.

Many times all the tickets are sold out before the
student body learns about the performance and as a
result students are not able to attend them.

We feel that the people connected with these pro-
ductions should cater more to the University com—
munity and not the Albany area.

A solution to this problem where everybody could
be satisfied would be to extend the run of the play or
hold the performance in a larger theatre.

.  ’ Theatre To A Present

Scene at Yale Drama Festival

The State University Theatre at
State University of New York at Al-

Attending the three-day event will
be students and faculty from drama
departments of United States and
Canadian colleges. They will meet
at New Haven to View each other's
work, discuss theatre, and her
distinguished speakers in the field.

"Of Mice and Men" wasthsopen-
ing play of the dramatic season at
SUNYA. it was directed by James
Leonard, assistant professor in the
Department of Speech and Dramatic

Art. The scenic design was by Rob-
ert Donnelly of the Department of
Speech and Dramatic Art.

Opening Production

The major roles,Georgeand Len-
nie, will be played by students,
James lobdell and Charles Bartlett,
respectively. At the Yale Drama
Festival, the first bill of plays, on
Friday evening, March 26, will in-
clude "Of Mice and Men," Barnard
College's production of Pirandello's
“Tonight We lmprovise," and the
University of Chicago’s scene from
Synge's “Riders to the Sea."

In the remaining three bills of

plays, the following schools will be
represented: Bucknell, Smith, Mid-
dlebury, C. W. Post, Ohio Univer-
sity, Emerson, Rutgers, Skidmore,
and Sir George Williams College of
Canada.
Moderating the discussion after
each bill of plays will be Robert
Corrigan and Theodore Hoffman,
both of the New York University
Department of Dramatics.

Necessary Operations Outlined
To Combat Guerilla Warfare

by D. Gordon Upham

There are two tasks which are
necessary to be carried out in any
successful countergueriila warfare.
The first of these is the military
defeat of the forces of the guerilla.
The second of these is the estab-
lishment of government authority
and the development of a viable so-
cial order.

It is necessary that both of these
tasks be carried outstmuitaneously.
if they are not, there lsilttle chance
of winning the war. This column
will focus its attention on the mili-
tary defeat of the guerillas.

The first military operation which
must be carried out isthe construc-
tion of adequate forces for defense
against the guerilla. The general
procedure is to set up combat zones
in which strong militia units guard
certain villages or strategic cen-
ters.

These regulars must be strong
enough to repel any surprise at-
tacks of guerliia forces.

Mobile Forces

The second military operation is
the development of a strong, mobile
force which is able to strikequickly
at guerilla concentrations and is
able to relieve the defensive forces
when they are attacked.

These mobile forces should be
centered in each combat zone with
a' cans of rapid transportation
available to them. These techni-
ques have been used in South Korea,
the Philippines, and Malaya with
successful results.

The mobile forces must be, in a
sense, irregular. That is, they do
not have a normal line of commun-
cations or supply. They are sup-

COMMUNICATIONS

Reasons for Apathy

To the Editor:

Once again as I pick up a copy of
the ASP, i find the perennial cry
of student "apathy." flow can stu-
dents be alive if they are as apathe-
tic as one iiilgiit be led to believe by
articles in high school and collage
newspapers?

The problem of motivating qual-
ified individuals to contribute their
talents and skills to formal college
organizations is not unique to this
university nor to this particular
time.

The question arises in speaking
of apathy, apathy towards what? it
is very possible that belonging to
formal group activities do not facil-
itate personal growth in an indi-
vidual.

Furthermore, in a university such
as ours, characterized by high levels
of academic interest, the stage of
development, of most formal orcanl.
zations' here lags behind this aca-
demlcclimate and may therefore
result in an interest the more in-
tellectual activities found more in
informal groups with the possible
exception of the Golden Eye activi-
ties which arnn't strictly speaking

 

a formal group.

The apathy of which the editors of
ASP speak, then, is apathy towards
specific organized activities. I new
sonsliy feel that when the activities
sponsored by the University help
satisfy the needs and events of the
new type of student coming to the
University, participation and qual-
ity will increase in all organiza-
tions.

The editors hypothesized conse-
quences of the current apathy to-
wards existing formal groups is
highly unwarranted.

As academically inclined a». the
students are here, they would lit!
the first to admit that they havu it
long way to go before they become
iiull “ivory towered bunglers."

In conclusion, 1 would like to sub-
mil the belief that as soon as the
formal activities here at the Uni-
verslty increase in intellectual up-
peal, participation will increase.

This is assuming, of course, that
the new academically inclined stu-
dents are able to find fulfillment
of their intellectual and social needs
in formal groups.

The University chapter of the
Summer Community Organization
and Political Education project will

It
with a meeting Tuesday, March 8.

SCOPE is similar to the Mis-
sissippi Summer Project of three
years 'ago. Many of the civil rights
groups involved in that endeavor
sponsor the SCOPE project.

SCOPE was created as an im-
provement on the method of the
older project by training its volun-
teers on campus and orienting them

This way the groups can spend less
time on learning to work together
and more on the job at hand because
of their original greater unity.

Needs Officers, Workers

This year's SCOPE unit will need
officers, committee workers and
applicants for this summer. The
main officers are chairman, a pro-
gram director, a secretary, treas-
urer and chairmen of various com-
mittees.

The first set of spring semester
A. D. plays will be presented on
March 29 and 30. Auditions for
these plays will be held on Monday
and Tuesday, March 7 and 8 at
7:30 p.m. in Richardson 278.

The directors, Mary Temple, John

the plays to be presented.

Of Programs on Sundays

Special Events Board will present
a series of student entertainment
programs on Sunday afternoons in
March. Each program will be at
3:80 p.m. in the Lower Lounge in
Brubacher Hall.

This Sunday's program will be
composed entirely of student enter-
tainment groups and of individuals.
Many of performers will be those
who performed in Preview '65. Two
definite acts for the program on
March 0 are Carol Roseiithol and
Ed Silver.

in future programs the Statesman
will sing and the Modern Dance
Group will perform.

Tuesday

The plays require at least eight
men and four women. All three di-
rectors agree that ons need not
have a great deal of theatre ex-.
perience to act in these plays. They
encourage everyone who has any
interest in “the stage" to try out.

The A.D. (Advanced Dramatic)
plays have long been an integral
part of the theatre activity of the
dramatic department at Albany. For
many students who are not directly
associated with such activities, how-
ever, the term remains unfamiliar.

The A.D. plays are one-act plays
produced and directed by students.
These students have the experience
and knowledge afforded them by
previous courses, and have, there-
fore, been admitted to the directing
course.

Any student, who is interested in
acting, may perform lil these plays
and is welcome to audition. The
rehearsal schedule is limited to the
three week period immediately pre-
ceding the production.
