Performs Various Bach Works

The Bach Aria Group, composed
of nine world-famous instrumental
and vocal soloists, will present a
concert in Page Hall at SUNYA,
Saturday, March 12, at 8:15 p.m.
The internationally renowned group
presents a unique program, in which
it places instrumental and vocal
soloists on equal footing.

The Group, in the past years,
has delighted large audiences in
New York and on concert tours in
all the ninior centers of the United

violin, and Paul Ulanowsky, piano.

William ll. Scheide, founder and
director of the Bach Aria Group,
is one of the foremost Bach auth-
orities in the world today. He formed
the Group in 1046 to present the solo
vocal-instrumental music of Johann
Sebastian Bach.

kind in the United States. Mr. Schoide
had discovered, in working through
the full edition of Bach's works,

constitutional.

The Court said that it "finds
that part of a statute is valid and
part is invalid. In such a case, if
the invalid part is so clearly sep-
arable from the rest that when it
is deleted there still remains a
complete and self-executing statute
which the legislature might reason-
ably wish to have left in operation
then the Court will isolate and hold
void only the invalid sections.

"But if the void portion is so in-
terwoven with the valid parts that
it cannot be struck out without
leaving an incomplete and more or
less mangled remainder, then the
Court will hold the entire aci void."

The Court based this decision on
Carter v. Carter Coal Company 298
U. S. 238. Using this as a precedent
the Court decided lhai each section
that was questioned of the election
bill would be ruled on separately.

Section 1

Section 1 of the electionbill which
states that a candidate shall"main-
tain an overall accumulative average
of 2.0." This provision was found
valid on the grounds of Article 1,
section 3 of the Student Assooiaiion
constitution: "The Central Council
shall provide for proper and just
Student Association elections and
tabulation of the results thereof."

liability, goori judgment and initia-

tively, were found constitutional on

The Court said that this violated
the constitution because the “proper
and just" clause of the constitution
which allows any member "of the
Student Association has an inherent
right to vote for those officials who
represent him."

Council Sets Elections,

Approves Budget Bill '

Acting on the Supreme Court's
ruling of the Constitutionality of
the Election Bill, Central Coun-
cil, in a special session on Fri-
day, March 4, established dates for
Class and MYSKANIA elections.
Voting has been set for Wednesday,
March 0 through Friday, March ll,
from 0-2 p.m.

Voting will be in the Perisiyles.
inauguration Day will be Sunday,
March 13. The ceremony will take
place in Page flail at 2 p.m.

Meeting on Thursday, March 8,
Council members also unanimously
approved the 1000-07 Budget Pro-
cedure Bill, introduced by Debbie
Friedman, lludgoi Commission
Chairman. According to the bill,
each organization requesting a hud-
get for the coming fiscal year must

amendment to replace the words
“student body" in Article 1, sec-
tions 2 and 3 of the Constitution
with the words “Student Associa-
tion." Upham pointed out that the
revision is .now necessary to in-
sure that only Student Association
members have a voice in Central
Council and MYSKANIA elections,
which these sections concern.

The measure was approved. Cen-
tral Council's power or need to de-
fine the term “Student Association
member," should it be questioned
was discussed.

Appointments
Several appointments were made
at the meeting. Chief Justice James
Ward of the Supreme Court swore
