expressed in our editorial of February
22. We feel that MYSKANIA can play an
important function in student government
by assuming a similar rele to an omni-
bus committee.

This new role would make MYSKANIA
a grievance committee for the student
body. It would investigate these griev-
ances and, if it found it valid, it could
make a recommendation and channel it
to the proper authority where it could
be corrected.

Since we first made public this idea,
many people have endorsed it. We hope

However, since there is only a small

The idea of a screening committee is
in accord with the new philosophy of the
student government. That is, only qual-
ified and deserving people who are will-
ing to work or who have shown their
desire to work should be on student
government.

It will eliminate one of'the problems
that has threatened student governments
here and at other Universities. It elim-
inates much of the popularity contest
which is involved in running for office
where not always the best candidate
wins.

We hope that elections in the future
will move in this direction. If it does
we feel that student government and the
student body__ will benefit greatly.

 . lil- n

by Jane Schneider

~Albsnyi is a city rich in history'

   

and poor in image

has been a settlement since 1614,
and possesses numbers of famous
land marks, events and honored
sons. ,

Albany retains, however, a living
memorial as well. it is described
in "The Deadlock of Democracy"

as follows: the Democrch organi-

zation in Albany ‘is so well pre-
served thst it should be put into
the Smithsonian before we forget
what a political machine looks like.

As to image, newcomers to Al-
bany shake their heads saying, "For
I capital city, ...." >

What makes this town the way it
is? To understand the- alleged im-
age, it might help to look at the
anachronistic machine.

. Loses Power '

In 1920 an ineffective leader. of
the Democratic city and county com-
mittees' lost power. Twenty years
previous he had gained it by a
compromise with the Republican
boss, Barnes. In the mayorality
election of 1899, Barnes accepted
Second Ward Democrat, Patty Mc-
cabe's, offer of support for four
years of patronage in return.

Through this gain in power, Mc-
Csbe increased his hold over his
fellow Democrats and took control
of the City Democratic Committee,
then the County Democratic Com-
mittee.

For twenty years this concession
to the Republicans -~wrang the
strength from the Democratic or-
ganization.

By mm the rampant and rigid
control of the city by Barnes had
aggrieved Democrats who were not
of the same disposition as Patty
McCabe had been a score of years
before. They fought for and won
the first significant office in the
county to be held by a Democrat

‘ in twenty years.

First County Otticer

It was also Dan O'Connell's first
county office, that of assessor. And
he had campaigned against a pro-
hibitionlst, in his recently retired
sailor suit. By 1920, Dan, along
with his brother, Ed and Edwin
Corning, had taken over both the
city and county Democratic com-
mittees.

These table-turning tyros worked
from a well-developed platform as
represented in the ALBANY TIMES
UNION of October 4, 1917.

First and foremost in the line of
complaints was the one against the.
Department of Assessment and Tax-

On the historic side, Fort Orange

elitieel lleeliiue

stion. As Dan O’Connell would have
explained it, the Republican asses-
sor would place an extravagant fax
» assessment on a resident.
The citizen in turn would find
himself in the compromising po-
Isition of visiting the Republican
ward leader in order to have the
valuation reduced substantially.The
payment understood might have been
some consideration at the time, but
was always taken for granted to be
the citizen'smemembrance on elec-
tion day. I, ‘

Finally, Dsn' deplored the politics
in mammals, the expected finan-
cial kickbacks from the police of-
ficers and firemen and city labor-
ers.

Campalgn Promises

Campaign promises rarely come
true, but Dan O'Connell kept one of
his. He lowered the tax rate. His
other three promises of that time
seem to have been forgotten in the
new-found power of fulfilling the
first. Those promises were to as-
sess property at its fair value; to
keep politics out of the Board of
Assessors; and to assess corpora-
tions’ property value Without regard
to political influence.

Actually, ‘since the tax rate is
likable, rather a malleable scale, n
was again the firsiand foremost tool
of the machine-on-the-rise. So that
even today, theenlightened and en-
rolled skip lighted over a lowered
tax bar, while the "others" lllilSl
either come to terms or be bled.

Looking back on the evolution of
the present machine, not much has
changed since the days of Patti
McCsbe’s tie in with the Republi-
cans. Then the one party system
and all its ramifications was Vli'-
tually sanctioned by the opposnion
Democrats. As it is run or run-
ning, this truly unique and anthuc
system runs over the city like a
juggernaut.

Despite the change in the name
of the party, the tactics or vices
have remained the same.

Also the same is the total vote
of Albany citizenry; In 1920 ap—
proximately fifty-one ihousnnd
voted. in 1965, the number was about
fifty-six thousand.

Surprisingly, or perhaps not sur-
prisingly, the population figures ex-
plain this by an anachronism in
demography. The 1920 census
counted one hundred thirteen thous—
and; the 1960 census, one hundred
twenty-three thousand.

But then, how many people Would
choose to move into a town \l'lili
this kind of government? No mow
no doubt that had chosen to pui up
with it at its inception over flit}.
years ago.

 

COMMUNICATIONS 

Criticizes Audience

To the Editor:

Tuesday night lsawthe final dress
rehearsal of "Stop the World." it
was a beautiful performance almost
ruined by an uneducated audience.

After the the first musical num-
ber 'the audience applauded. l was
appalled. Is Albany so culture
starved that people don't know bet-
ter than to do this?

The proper time to applaud is at
the end of an act and only then.
Applause during the act ruined some
of the most beautiful moods created
by the performers. i hope the rest
of the audiences ofi'Siop the World"
know their etiquette better than
Tuesday night’s audience did.

Biessmg in Disguise
To the Editor:

Anybody for an election? This
business about a foul-up in the
election schedule and all the bulls-
balou might just be a blessing in
disguise.

The school has been steeped in
apathy for the last decade and it
seems that nothing can be done to
increase the student participation
in school affairs.

We might be able to do something
with more dynamic administrators
and class officials but this does not

Most students in this unlvcrsnx
seem to be in arut so whatis ncedud
is to get them out of this rut nnd

5, was... been, .

The extended length of
the campaign for freshmen
and sophomore class offi-
cers due to the Election
Bill controversy only added
to the already lively and
spirited campaigning.

Most of the nominees have been
talking to any one who will listen
about their platforms, promises and
pledges. This has been especially
true of the freshman class as each
candidate tries to out-do the other in
promising to make his class the
best ever.

In order to help the candidates
for freshman and sophomore class
office further publicize their mes-
sages, most have been contacted
and turned'in statements.

Candidate Cleveland

William Cleveland, candidate for
president of the Class of ’68, states
"During the’pasi year, [have gained
a great deal of knowledge in the
workings of our class. ihave seen
what our class can do, and have be-
come aware Vof what could be done
to improve the quality of projects
and increase the number of these
activities."

Cleveland continued, “in the next
year, the potential of the Class of
1968 will become evident to the Uni-
versity, and this is the year in which
we will need capable and experienced
leadership.”

Igor Koruluk, vice presidential
running-mate of Cleveland, also
made a statement. “The position of
vice president of the Class of 1968
requires a combination of respon-
sibility and insight as to the needs
of the Class. As present vice presi-
dent of the class, i feel i have
gained the knowledge necessary to
understand the needs and capabil-
ities of the class."

Koruluk Comments

Igor also said, "Communication
is the essence for coordination of
the Class of 1968, and the aim of
my campaign is to insure the best
possible communication to all areas
of the Class."

John Kuhn, another presidential
candidate for the class of ’68, com-
mented, "i feel that there are two
major issues in this campaign. The
first issue is whether the Class
desires a part-time president such
as the incumbent or a full-time
president such as i would be, if
elected."

Kuhn said, "The second issue is
whether or not the members of the
Class should be consulted on inat-
ters which affect the Class. [think
that the Class should be consulted
and I propose an elected advisory
board and a monthly class meet-
ing and newsletter.”

Vice Presidential Hopeful

Ken Walker, vice presidential
hopeful for the class of ’68, stated,
"I believe that a vice president
should never be content to be a fig-
urehead. I would never allowmyself
to sit idly by in the office of vice
president.

Ken continued, "It is the duty of
the vice president to aid the presi-
dent in carrying out the desires of
the class. This I would do!"

Lynn ilewltt, secretarial nom-
ihec, Said, "I don't feel that the
class is well enough informed about
meetings and vnrious class activi-
lies and, as a result, we are not us
unified as we could be. If i am
910mm 1 will post the minutes of
Class meetings for all the members
of our class.”

Another candidate for the score-
hh‘y of the class of '68, Rosemary
Gerizaila said, "Contrary to many
people's opinions, i feel that our
class is not apathetic. I think we
have many students who would be
Willing to do much for their class
and. could be very enthusiastic lo

lloward Wechsler, candidate for
treasurer of the class of '68, com-
mented, “I plan on, improving the
communication problem betwecnthe
officers and the members of the
“ASS by letting them knowhowiheir
money is being spent and where."

 

  

Gadzaiia continued, “As class
secretary, i would attempt to im-

prove one of the key factors in or-

ganization, the problem of com-
munication between the leaders of
the class and its members."

John Howland, presidential can-
didate for the class of '69, com-
mented, “The postponement ofelec-
tions was unfortunate and ill-timed.
But I sill feel that it is important,
now more than ever, that every
freshman vote. The class of ’69 can
now show that our interest and spirit
is lasting, that it can endure any
postponement.”

Alan Babcock, vice presidential
candidate, stated, ::John and I, if
elected, will lead a government that
is interesting, effective and unified.
By personal contact and newsletter,
we have outlined concrete sugges-
tlons designed to create a freshman
government for freshmen."

Finn Speaks

Sol Finn, presidential nominee for
the class of '69, said, “We don't
claim credit for discovering the
unity. problem on campus, yet we
feel we have found the solution toit.
We have planned an extensive social
program, leading into valuable con-
tacts and class awareness.

Dan Lego, vice presidential can-
didate, commented, "We feel that
the answer to the issue of his cam-
paign: apathy; is good hard work.
‘We’re eager to lead you and to work
with you to bring about a little ex-
citement on this campus. We'll be
where you can find us, meet us
and work with us.”

Leslie Rose, secretarial nominee
for the class of ’69, said, “Unity
within a class is very important
and the only way if can be achieved
is if every freshman is willing to
participate in activities that the
newly elected officers hope to in-
itiate."

Communication Problem

Nancy Broderick, also a candi-
date for secretary of the class of
'69, commented, “I propose several
plans that may put. us all on the road
to solving the problem of communi-
cation here. Posting of class min-
utes in academic complexes and
dormitories will keep us informed
on policies, legislation and upcom-
ing events discussed at class meet-
ings.”

Mady Mixson, candidate for trees-
urer, stated, “Under the present
policy of our school government,
you are not allowed to vote for class
offices if you did not pay your stu-
dent tax. This is only one issue
which I hope to resolve if i am
elected.”

Gary Maitson, also a nominee for
treasurer of the class of '69, said,
“I feel certain functions should be
made by the class; among these
are regular class meetings and a
financial newsletter to inform the
class on important matters. AisoI
hope to see a weekend and a schol-
arship fund.”

Apathy Problem

Another candidate for treasurer,
Richard Longshore said, "Through-
oui the campaign, apathy has been
decried as the primary flaw of the
class of ’69. i feel that this is due
more to a lack of knowledge about
campus events than anything else.
if elected, I should propose that
liaisons be set up between the class
and the dorms, organizations and
administration.”

 s for-,lll-lass~ Ofﬁces “co
Catnpaign statements

In. new course, Russian 5, of-
fered next fall at SUNYA, persons
interested in Soviet Russia's sci-
entific and industrial advances. or
Russian geography and economics
will be able to study Russian pub-
lications. The course will be taught
by Professor Valerian F. Kolesoff.

The course will be open to anyone
who has had at least one year of
college Russian or three years of
Russian in high school and some
preparation in the sciences.

To insure each student of being
able to pursue his own special field
of interest, the class will bedivided
into: small groups. The course has
been designed to leach specialized
terminology in various fields.

These fields include mathematics,
physics, chemistry. geology, biolo-
gy, geography, economics, and en-
gineering.

Professor Kolesoff, a specialist
in the field of Slavic studies, feels
the problem in reading Russian
scientific sources lies with students
who are not well-trained in the
specialized terminology.

Consequently students are often
misled in their research by think-
ing that the literal translation of a
Russian word provides its correct
scientific interpretation. In this
manner the existingdiciionaries are
inadequate if the translation is done
by an inexperienced person.

Professor Kolesoff, a former en-
gineer and agroblologist, is also a
specialist in Russian linguistics,
literature, and Sovietology. He stud-
ied engineering, agrobiology, and
related sciences at Prague Tech-
nical University, Czechsiovakia.

He also holds a B. S. in Agra-
biology from Rutgers University,
and an AM. in Russian from Middle-
bury College. He also studied at San
Jose College.

Before joining the faculty of
SUNYA, Professor Kolesoff suc-
cessfully taught his course as an
intercollegiate course for students
at Smith College, Amherst College,

Phi Beta lambda Meeting

Phi Beta Lambda will have a
business meeting on Thursday,
March 10 at 7:30 p.m.in Brubacher,
Room 2. Topics for discussion will
be “The National and State Conven-
tions, Elections, Constitution and

Building Better Bridge

by Harry Nuchels

Most average bridge players know
that plays like the squeeze and the
coup exist. They also think that the
“expert's” ability to make these
plays is the reason he is called an
expert.

in actuality, these plays come up
so seldom that this ability is only a
very small advantage. The expert
makes his bread and butter by mak-
ing very few mistakes.

Take today’s hand, for instance.
The bidding is routine. South's re-
bld says he lias'lQ-ZO points and
North can add up to 331, so he bids
the slam.

South wins the opening lead in his
band and plays the diamond king.
He then plays a small diamond,
and when West plays low, he finesses
the ten. South now wins five dia-
momls, three hearts, three spades,
and the ace of clubs to bring home
his slam.

Easy. Any idiot could do it. But
consider the second trick. South
can count twelve tricks inany situa-
tion except if one of the opponents
has four diamonds. Then he will
have to take a finesse. But which
opponent should he guess for the
diamonds?

The answer is easy. Both of

them. Notice that if South leads a
diamond toward the Ace at trick
two, he will go down if West has
all the diamonds. But, ifhe plays a
high diamond from his hand first,
he guards against either opponent
holding four diamonds.

With a high diamond remaining
in both hands, he can still tske a
finesse against either cpponent.The
next time you play a contract that
looks "cold," take a look at the
hand before you play it and see if
anything might be wrong.
