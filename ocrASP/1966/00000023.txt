all the meaning and depth of its

Ambitious Executive

At the start, we find Jim Lobdell
playing Littlechap, an extremely
ambitious (in a Caeserian sense)
junior executive. After proclaim-

~' ing this ambition sharply and cliply

in the song, “i Wanna Be Rich,"
Littlechap proceeds to .prenantlze
(meaning to make pregnant) the
"Typically English” virgin (?),
Evie, the ,boss’_ daughter, played by
Carla Pinelii. This clever stunt does
nothing more than drop 01’ Ramb-
ling Rose Littlechap into the sa-
cred (?) bonds of matrimony (oh
yes, and-it also produces a child).

we follow [little
and his ever-V creasingrfimily up
ttie'i‘adder of success, andhim down
the ladder of morality; as we travel
fromvsludgepool to Moscow, toGer-

 

many, to NOVI'YOI‘K, and to the re-

 
   
   

tirement tOWn of‘Sitnvale. Through-
‘out his life, Littlechap seems un-
failingly prone (no pun intended) to
fall horizontally into the beds of
assorted mistresses and occasion-
ally his wife’s (all these_are played
by Miss Pineili which, you’ll have
to agree, is quite a trick‘).

After egocentric Littlechap ac-
cumulates manifold awards, wealth,
and fame; his wife dies. Looking

‘ back on an empty life, he is finally

struck with the realization of its
emptiness, and is almost forced to
bitterly ask himself — FOR WHAT?!
He is now aware that he has lived
with concern and care for none but
himself, and therein lies the me‘an-
ing of the show and the moving
song, “What Kind of Fool am 1?"

Jim Lobdell did a fine job in the
role of Littlechap as was expected
from his past successes. His
"Lumbered" tune was enjoyany
humorous, and "What Kind of Fool
Am I?" was exquisite. Unfortun-
ately, Mr. Lobdell's singing voice
is not strong enough for this show
as was evident in "Gonna Build a
Mountain," and. "Once in a L'lfe-
time” dragged. Mr. Lobdellhandled
pantomime and emotion wonderfully,
and he did well with facial expres-
sion although he was hampered
greatly by wild make-up.

Pinelli Magnificent

Carla Pinelli was magnificent. If
she’s a neWcomer, I hope she be-
comes a solid veteran of the stage.
She handled the fantastically wide
range of emotion, character, voice,
accent, and spirit marvelously. Miss
Pinelll was four different charac-
ters, and she was superb as each.
If one was to compare the four, one
could not say that any one of her
roles was worse than another, but
that one was better than another,
, for her performance "can only be

 

regarded positively. ‘

Oscar Time In Hollywood Closes "
‘Zhivago,’ Julie-Andrews Head List

by Douglas Rathgeb

It is getting close to Oscar time
again, that time when every critic
and his brother climb out on the
proverbial limb and make predic-
tions about who is going to win what.

Although the Academy Awards
ceremony is always an exciting af-
fair, this should beone of the closest
races in many years. No single
film dominates as did “My Fair
Lady” last year and “Lawrence of
Arabia” in 1062. This makes things
considerably more difficult than
usual for the critics,who are always
on the lookout for "safe" choices.

Strangely enough, the three films
which garnered the most nomina-
tions did not enjoy universal ap-
proval from the nation’s critics.
David Lean’s massive “Dr.
Zhivago," which received ten nom-
inations, was called an elaborate
soap opera by many; “The Sound of
Music" was said to be overly senti-
mental and badly acted. It received
ten nominations. Stnaley Kramer’s
"Ship of Fools," recipient of eight
nominations, also had its share of
the critics’ barbs.

The' entire Oscar race hinges on
these three films, although "Zhi-
vago" and "Music" are really the
hottest contenders. As many a past
awards ceremony has proven, once
a major contender starts winning,
it usually keeps winning. The clas-
sic example is the 1959 production
of "Ben-Hur," which won eleven
Oscars out of twelve nominations.

Hence, if "Zhivago" starts towin
the cinematography, editing, color
costume design and set direction
awards, it is quite likely that it
will go on to win as best picture.
As things stand, "Zhivago" looks
to do just that. It should win at
least five of the gold statuettes.

The nominees for acting honors
are all exoellent this year,_and with
the eXCeption of the award for best
actress, which Julie Andrews
("Sound of Music”) should win
easily, the race looks to be very
close.

Osk‘ar Werner will probably be
voted best actor, for his role in
“Ship of Fools,” although he will
have stiff competition from Richard
Burton (“The Spy Who Came In
From the Cold”) and Rod Stelger
(“The Pawnbroker"). '

The Oscar for best supporting
actor may have to be cut into five
pieces and distributed among the
nominees, for there is no real
"favorite" in this category. A very

good possibility for the award,how-
ever, is Frank Finlay for “Othello.”

The best supporting actress
should be Ruth Gordon for “Inside
Daisy Clover," although Peggy Wood
cannot be ruled out for her role in
"The Sound of Music."

The best foreign language film will
either be the Czech "Shop On Main
Street” or Italy’s “Marriage, Ital-
ian Style.” The Czechfilm should
win, however. Fellini’s "Juliet of
the Spirits" was not among the
nominees.

Among this year's nominees for
best director is Hiroshi Tashiga—
bare, the first Oriental, to be hon-
ored by the academy. He directed
“Woman in the Dunes." But unless
a miracle occurs, David Lean should
win for his work on "Zhivago."

The award for best screenplay
based on material from another
medium will most likely be given
to Abbny Mann for “Ship of Fools”
and 'the award 'for best original
screenplay should go to “Darling.”

In the “best special visual ef-
fects" category, James Bond should
continue to hold amonopoly. “Thun-
derball” looks to be a easy winner
over its only competition, “The
Greatest Story Ever Told."

The best feature-lengthdocumen-
tary film will be either “To Die in
Madrid" or “The Eleanor Roose-
velt Story.

More Financial Aid Available

Under Higher

Donald A. Whitluck, Director of
Financial Aid, announces that Uni—
versity students may expect con-
siLlcrably increased financial as-
slstunce under the Higher Education
Act of 1905.

Unmarried undergraduates whose
families have been unable to con-
tribute to their education may expect
assistance under the new Educa-
tional Opportunity Grant program.
The amount of grant, awarded, rang-
ing from $200 to $800 per academic
year, will have to be matched by
scholarships and loans from fed-
eral, state (insrituiiuuai) and local
sources.

After the 1960—07 academic year
students receiving grants and re-
maining in the upper 50% of their
respective classes may expect an
additional $200 which will not have
to be matched by other assistance.
These grants will decrease some
of the heavy borrowing forced upon
many University students.

Work-Study

College Work-Study Pro-
gram, which formerly functioned
under rigid eligibility guidelines,
has prcently been opened up to
permit employment of most stu—
dents requiring general financial
assistance. A total of 205 full—time
positions will be available for the
summer session; students may apply
for these positions after March 16
in the Financial Aida Office.

gram will he maintained at the level
required to meet the needs of State

dents have been granted National
Defense Loans this year.

Student Loan Program has de-
creased the grace period before
repayment from one year to nine
months. Also, students going on to
teach in schools catering In the
“culturer underprivileged" maybe
granted 15% forgiveness of the total
loan per year for each year of
teaching up to the full amount of
the loan.

Guaranteed Loans

Under the Higher Education Act
of 1965, the Federal Government
is presently implementing a guar-
anteed loan program which will
function through existing loan agen-
cies. Loans in the amount of$1000,00
per year for undergraduates and
$1500.00 per year for graduate stu-
dents will be available.

Students coming from families
whose "adjusted gross" incomes
do not exceed $15,000.00 will not
begin repayment of loans entil they
have terminated their education;
repayment will be made at the rate
of 3% on the declining balance.
