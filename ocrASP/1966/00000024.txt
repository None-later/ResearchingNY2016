r _ Selective Schedule

Ahout the Selective Service policy
of asking for the grades of students
to judge'their draftrstatus, Presi-

V ‘dent Collins said that the grades

would be released only upon the re-
quest or with the knowledge'of the

student.

 The 'exam which will be given is
.an'attempt to equalize the standards
'by which students will be judged.
The definition of a successful stu-

' dent varies with each institution

and the exam will provide a basis
of ability, President Collins ex-
plained. '

it will be set up as a test of gen-
eral ability and not on one specific

' field such as math or science. Al-

though some universities have pro-
posed the plan of having no grades
at all because of the pressure, Dr.
Collins commented that this was
avoiding the issue.

He was not in sympathy with this

Flutist of Group

Sam Baron, flutist of the Bach

claim for his solos and ensemble

performances. He is one of the

'luremost American flutists today,
and in addition to his work with the
Isach Aria Group, is a member of

')rmer with the New York Cham-
er Soloists. '

Robert Bloom isone ofthe world’s

mances, his solo appearances with

been acclaimed throughout the coun-
try.

Bernard Greenhouse is acknowl-
edged as one of the most remark-

activities have been marked by tri-
umphs in Europe, South America,
and the United States.

Key Syit'etn
When the key system "was men-,g

thinks, however, that this is too
big a step at this time.

    
   
  
  
 
  
  

. MYSKANIA

7 If MYSKANIA were to expand its
role and: become a grievance com-
mittee, Dr; Collins stated, that he,
would work with it in that capacity.
Dr. Collins wodld welcome MYS-
KANIA .as a reasonable avenue of
communication.

He also said that no reduction in
either room and board rates or
bookstore prices is planned. The
overall report on the FSA was
based on figures form three dif-
ferent units within the State Uni-
versity of New York System.

General Statements

The report made general state-
ments, and what was wrong at one
was not at the other. 'Dr. Collins
pointed out that here the bookstore
was criticized for not making enough
profit which would not be a reason
to reduce prices.

Founder of Group
William H. Scheide, founder and
director of the Bach Aria Group,
is one of the foremost Bach auth-

the Group in 1946 to present the
solo-vocal-instrumental music of
Bach. Mr. Scheide had discovered,
in working through the full edition
of Bach’s works, that there was an
infinite variety of arias and duets

for voices and instrumamc

Typical Examples
Typical examples of press re-
views of the Bach Aria Group’s
concerts include: “Music without
equal or any near. parallel,” "Per-
formance such as it is seldom
one's pleasure to hear," and “All
were extraordinary. All deserved
the mightiest of mention."

The boys spent much oftheirtime

of their great rewards was in getting

History of Segregation
Ken Fuchsman, a member last

Reconstruction ended in the South.
Up until 1890,Negroes enjoyed many

IFG to Feature 'The Naked Nighi’

Tonight the International Film
Group will present “The Naked
Night," one of Ingmar Bergman's
darkest and loneliest films. The
film is in Swedish with English'
subtitles. '

Ingmar Berman is one ofthe
most eminent of contemporary Eur-
opean film directors. Internationally
acclaimed for his “The Seventh
Seal” and “The Virgin Spring," he
has come to be known as one of the
most uncompromising yet subtle of
modern film artists.

shat at. night, adding to the hate-
ness and dessication of the setting.

Builds Up Atmosphere

Bergman attempts build up of a
dark and sinister atmosphere
through the use of the dim, and
angular lighting, the decor is sparse
too, thus heightening the loneliness
'of the owner, and standing in ironi-
cal contrast to the voluptuous sen-
sual beauty of the equestrienne.

The pity and truth of the film are
also heightened by Bergman’s skill-

Bergman’s thought is p.
with a search for good and evil,
and a thorough investigation of the
human peronality. In “The Naked
Night" (also known as “Sawdust-
and Tinsel”), he is primarily con-
cerned with the dark side of this
personality.

Captures Irony

in “The Naked Night,” Bergman
attempts to capture the irony of
the circus life that has fascinated
so many artists. The middle-aged
circus owner has fallen in love
with a young and passionate eques-
trienne.

The equestrienne, after she has
persuaded the owner to forsake his
family for her, is in turn seduced
by a young actor. The owner,plung-
ing into despair begins to take to the
bottle.

After an argument with the actor,
and a fight in which he is beaten,
the owner attempts to commit sui-
cide. After this, the owner and the
equestrienne begin to realize the
depths of their despair and move on
with the circus into “The Naked
Night."

Acclaimed for its content, the
film is no less admirable for its
technique. Most of the film was
