Anytime we take a jet up, there are almost

alWays leftover seats.

So it occurred to us that we might be able

to fill a few of them, if we gave the young
people a break on the fare, and a chance to
see the country.

The American Youth Plan"

We call the idea the American Youth Plan,

and what it means is this:
» American will pay half the jet coach fare
for anybody 12 through 21.

It’s that simple.
All you have to do is prove your age (a birth

certiﬁcate or any other legal document will do)
and buy a $3 identiﬁcation card.

We date and stamp the card, and this en-

titles yon to a hall-fare ticket at any American
Airlines counter.

The only catch is that you might have to

wait before you get aboard; the fare is on a
standby basis.

“Standby” simply means that the pas-

sengers with reservations and the servicemen
get on before-yon do.

"Then the plane‘s yours.

As I was on my way home from a
hard day of classes and meetings,
I made the awesome misfakeof
passing the office of the ASP. All
of a sudden, a soft sultry voice
said to me, “How would you like
to work for me?" Needless to say,
I was flabbergasted by this out-
and-out offer of employment.

50, innocent that I am, i walked
through the door and said, “Sure,

what the hell?” And again, the sul- -

try voice _spoke and said, “Create
for me a masterpiece, a gem, a
work of art. Write a column for the
glory and honor of the great and
glorious ASP." So, here I am,
obeying the sultry voice and writing
a column.

The topic of this article is cre-
ative self-expression, I am a trum-
pet pla er of sorts and I am con-
sidere to be somehwat of a nut on
Jazz. I will try to give you, through
these two media of rnlne, an idea
of what it’s like to create a dif-
ferent masterpiece each time I pick
up that "ax" of mine.

When a Jazz musician is really
“swinging” on a particular riff, he
has a feeling the like of which only
a god could experience. He has been
given his handful of clay - asong—
and is given the task of turning it
into another Adam. I myself have
felt as if my brain and my horn are
no longer a part of the mundane
world that is my body.

My brhin is acting like the brain

' of God and the horn is the tool he

is using to make his world. lpick
up the instrument, the pianist starts
the song and my own moment of
greatness starts along with him.
I feel as if the angels are at my
beck and call. The three valves are
like three angels carrying the notes
of my song to earth as if they were
the seeds of trees and flowers.

After the first statement of the
theme, I start to improvise on the
original melody. it's as if, unsatis-
fied with just trees and ﬂowers,
God had to create whole forests and
rivers and quiet glens oftranquility.
He, too, improvised on his original
theme and what did he end up with?
A worldl

Thus do I. My world is as full of
trees as His. It’s as full of rivers
and glens of tranquility. There's
Just one thing wrong with it. My
world disappears every time I stop
playing. And for a moment, I'm
like a fallen angel wondering which
way to turn. And then God smiles
and says to me, “Play another
one.’ Slowly, the world begins
anew and again l'm a god.acreator.

This, avid readers, is what it‘s
like to create a work ofart,whether
it be a piece of music ofaseventeen
syllable poem. For one brief mo-
ment, you are a god. You are a
creator of something new that could
not have had lifeifyouhad not picked
up an instrument or a pen or a
paintbrush. This thing depends on
you for life.

"How would you like to work for
me?"

by Roger Burkin

I was in a nostalgic mood the
other night so [decided to play my
,old Kingston Trio albums. 1 call
.ythem old because I mean the orig-
vinal three singers — Nick Reynolds,
. Bob Shane, and Dave Guard.

Although there were many folk
‘stngersﬁ before the Trio such as
Pete Seeger and Woodie Guthrie,
it seems that folk, singing really
gained popularity when the~King-
ston Trio emerged on the scene.

I Worshlpped them.

If it were not for their inspira-
tion, I probably would never have
taken an interest in guitar. It seemed
everyone was trying to imitate their
"ivy" style, including the striped
shirts, white socks, and loafers.
Eventially, the Trio’s agenda ca-
tered more to the audiences’ in-
terests than to performing in ethnic
style.

Minerva’s Many Talents Merit;
HerPlace at New Campus,

by Ed Longc

After accounting for many folds
of draping clothes which she would
not remove, her vital statistics
were approximated by measurement
to be 44-29-41. Not bad I’d say for
a woman who is at least, but will
admit historically to no more than
'78 years of age. She has other dis-
advantages; for instance, she's 6’6”
and she’s plastered.

Seriously though, Minerva may
not have the best figure of any wo-
man at State, but her long tradi-
tion gives her an honored place
among them. Aftergall, the simple
fact that she has been standing in
Draper's foyer since 1909 should
give her some distinction.

Torrid Contlagratlon ‘

It is presumed that she was paid
for by the “dollar fee" that students
once had to pay to take make-up ex-
ams. She first started standing in
State’s former Willett Street Build-
ing, but when a torrid conflagration
reduced that to ashes around her
feet, she was moved to Draper and
has been there ever since.

About her being plastered, I am
not using that term in the common
sense, however she is astatue made

of a hollow plaster cast and done in
an ancient Roman revival style. If
you examine her closely, you will
find that she has withstood the blow
of her years quite well, though not
ﬂawlessly.

l'ler right side lras particularly
suffered from the battle against
time. Her right arm has been broken
at the elbow, her right index finger
has been broken and replaced poor-
ly, and (though I‘m not sure, I
think) her spear’s shaft is not only
not the original, but it's wooden.
Affectionately, however, I feel that
these imperfections only make her
more human and attractive.

Aside from the study ofherphysi-
cally and historically, in the myth-
ological aspect, just who is Minerva
and why should we have a statue of
her?

Intimate Expose

An intimate expose discovers her
to be the Roman Goddess of Wisdom.
The original spelling of her name
is Menerva, which is derived from
Latin-mans (mind) and meminisse
(remember). She is a virgin deity
worshipped mainly by those whode-
sired success in the various arts,
teaching and medicine.

So why the spear and helmet you

‘crnssroatls’ Promotes African lies

by Ann Byrnos

Modern college students areoften
characterized as being “pragmatic
ldealists." There is one organized
group which ranks among these ac-
tive idealists and that is the mem-
bers ofOperatlons Crossroads Afri-
ca.

Crossroads is as easy to explain
as friendship, for Crossroads is
precisely that...“ is a work camp
seminar friendstrlp program. To es-
tablish understanding and friend-
ship between Cnnada, the United
States, and Africa is the alrn of
the two hundred or so Canadian
and American university students.

Studont "Counterparts"

This past summer was Cross-
roads seventh in Africa with 24
different Crossroads groups in 19
countries. The program is arranged
by Dr. James Robinson, a Negro
minister from New York City and
founder of Crossroads, and thoAfri-
can Crossroads Committee to pro-
vide for African “counterparts,”
usually students, for the Ameri-
can and Canadian students.

With a work project as a vehicle
for communication, Crossroaders
attempt to establish bonds of un-
derstanding and friendship with their
African counterparts. Through sein-
irrars, recreation, and informal con-
versations, the Crossroads become
unofficial ambassadors of friend-
ship.

Work as a Vehicle
Even though the construction of
a clinic or church or road, for ex-
ample, is beneficial to that par-
ticular African county, it serves

only as a vehicle and is secondary
to the purpose of substituting the
misconceptions of both Africans and
Americans with positive friendship
and understanding.

Crossroaders are Canadian and
American university students who
are able to enrich their particular
African country, their own country
and themselves. They are not Peace
Corps Volunteers in that they have
no technical skill or specialized
service to offer.

Friendship Forco

They are not the organizers or
the directors of the project. They
are sincere people who are second-
arily a labor force, but primarily
a friendship force.

Crossroads is a non-profit or-
ganization, and has the approval of
the federal government as in the
words of the late President John
F. Kennedy:

"This group and this effort really
were the progenitors of the Peace
Corps and what this organization
has been doing for a number of
years led to the establishment of
what I considered to be the most
encouraging indication 'of the dc-
sire for service not only in this
country but all around the world
that we have seen in recent years."

Because Crossroads is a private
contribution sponsored organiza-
tion, a selected participant, upon
private study of his assigned Afri-
can country and the submission of
a required term paper, must as.
sumo one-half of the total expense
of the program.

ask? Good question. She also works
part-time as a patroness of war-
riors who win victory through cun-
ning, prudence, courage, persever-
ance, or cheating (only kidding on
that last).

Don't forget to plan a little time
for the celebration of Quinquartus.
That’s Minerva's festival which be-
gins on the fifth day after the Ides
of March and lasts for five days.

Attectlonato Tradition

There she stands, the only well-
known bit of sentimentality and af-
fectionate tradition we have. Which
brings me to the point of this type-
writer leftover. Let’s bring her
with us —' to the new campus that
is.

Minerva, rendezvous for thous-
ands of students over the years,
she'll be a fond remembrance of
"Education by Annex" and good ol'
dingy Draper. Who cares if she’ll
stick out like the proverbial sore
thumb;ivy won'tgrow onthose walls,
we’ve got to have somethingl What
is a university without tradition?

When we do bring her with us,
(PLEASE!) let's not put her in any
glass case. I have a strange feeling
that someday, someone will say,
"What is that statue doing here?"
And in response, some nutty writer
from the ASP will tap on her and
find out she‘s hollow, and measure
her just for some information that's
different.

But that can only happen if we
bring herl I

I guess I'll never forget how much .

est in another folk group. It'wu
not very hard finding one because
the old Kingston three started a
movement that is still continuing-

As_ soon as folk singing caughts
on, groups like the Brothers'Four‘
began to appear on college campusesI
everywhere and people like Peter,
Paul and Mary came out of the
coffee houses onto stages through-'
out the nation. Folk music became.
so popular that the Newport Folk?
Festival was nearly part of Ameri-
can tradition. ,

Due to this Festival, several of‘
our folk leaders came intothelime-I

Baez and Bob Dylan, currently shows
its effect on college campuses.Even
more recently, Dylan broke from his
straight ethnic line to produce folk-
rock.

Mode Music Diversified

Scorned by some and cheered by
others, he made folk music more
diversified than ever before. To
me, folk singing is entertainment.
If a person or a group has a good
sound,‘I go for it. [am not neces-
sarily interested in the message
hidden in the song. It is unfortun-
ate that most folk songs today de-
pend on the words rather than the
music.

It seems American is at one ex-
treme or the other. Rock 'n roll
depends strictly on the beat if I
may take the liberty to assume that
the words have virtually no mean-.
ing at all, while much of the “new”
folk music is crying out for a
catchy tune.

Maybe that is what they are weep-
ing about. I may be wrong, but it
seems to me that this change in
format has cost folk singing much
of its popularity. I cannot be thank-
ful enough for my old Kingston Trio
albums.

I thought I would pass along some
folk medicine since this is the flu
season. What to do when you have ' ‘
the chills: Rap a blanket tightly
around your bod. Now, run up and
down your corridor three times,
charge into your room and slide
under your bed. In this way, the
chills will go sailing into your bed.

Blackwood is the first conventlor.
the beginning bridge player usually
learns, and from that time on, it is
also the one that is most often used
wrongly.

In today's hand, Southls definitely
interested in slam when his partner
announces his strength, but the South
hand is not suited for Blackwood. If
he had bid four no trump and then
tive na'trump, he would have to

stop at six.

But look how nicely the use of cue ,
bids works out. Southlras first round
control of clubs. North has first
round control oi'diamonds. South has
first round'control of hearts. North
now bids his second round controlof
clubs. South shows second round
control of diamonds. ,_ ,

Now when North shows his second a
round control of hearts, South can
gladly bid the grand slam. Notice
that South doesn't care if the sec-
ond round controls in the dummy
are kings or singletons (one of
them almost has to be a king for
North's first bid).

The hand plays like a charm.
Trump are drawn and four rounds
of clubs allow South to discard a
heart. Now the two red aces and a
heart ruff in the-dummy reduce the
South hand to trump for the balance
of the tricks.

it is a good idea when you are
thinking about slam to look at your
hand and decide whether it is suited
for Blackwood before you go barging
to four no trump. If the hand con-
tains solid suit combinations like
king, queen, jack or perhaps king, '"
small, then Blackwood is for you.

But with broken honor sequencea
or unsupported aces and kings, try
another method. In the first case,
cue bids usually work best, and in
the second case, your partner should
be the one to bid the Blackwood.
