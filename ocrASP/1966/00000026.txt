One of the most pressing problems
student government will face in the next

few weeks is budgets, and how much,

money each organization should be al-
lotted. - v

This is particularly acute because
of the voluntary nature of student tax
and the uncertainty of the amount of
money student government will be able
to work with.

The percentage of the student body
who paid their student tax was sur-
prisingly high this semester but, as we
statedKin an earlier editorial, the real
test will come next semester.

At his press conference Monday,
President Collins announced that con-
struction on the new campus is going
well and, barring any labor strikes,
we will move to the academic complex
this summer and classes will be held
their next semester. '

The structure and atmosphere of
the new complex is indicative of the
new horizons of the University. It is big
and impersonal and does not impress
one as a campus that welcomes its stu-
dents to its halls of learning.

When the University moves there, it.

will lose all of its vestiges of tradition
and evolve into a large state university.

There is nothing that can be done
about this; the ever burgeoning number

fl t against guerllla forces should
no:h alien'ite the-native population.-
This is an absolute requirement if

  

under the firm control ofthe govern-
ment: l ,

As was demonstrated by the
French in their were in Southeast
Asia, alienation of the population
leads to the eventual defeat of the
force which uses terroristic meas-
ures to. excess. ,.

If the United States and South
Vietnam were to allow a large
measure of brutality and unneces-
sary force, they would be givingwthe
Viet Cong another reason to over-
throw the government forces. The
Viet Cong would also benefit from
the confusion caused by wholesale
slaughter. I

The Viet Cong have used terror-
lstic methods, but they have used
these methods to their advantage.
By assassinatlng selected persons
who have remained loyal to the
government, they have eliminated
the opposition, and, at the same
time, they have shown the popula-
tion the impraticality of siding with
the government.

Terrorism in War

Throughout history, war has con-
tinued to be lmminently unpleasant.
It has repeatedly involved the kill-
ing of people; enough so that one
can generalize that war involves
the killing of human beings.

However, there has arisen a gen-
eral concept of what is fair in war
and what is not. In ther words,
it is felt by most people that war
should not have as its object the
desire to kill every person on the
enemy side.

The decision as to whom should
be kllled is generally decided upon
4by the leaders at the upper level
of government. Unfortunately, this
decision is often transmitted im-
perfectly or incomprehensibly to
the soldier in the field.

Also, the soldier in the field may
be moved by fear or anger todecide
for himself which person or persons
should be killed. This is inevitable.

The United States and South'Viet-
namese troops have been repeatedly
criticized for their acts of brutality
against the peasants of South Viet-
nam. Although some of these reports
are exaggerated and some are about
totally accidental events, enough of
them could have been corrected.

Since the goals of antisgueriua

~, warfare have been defined as being

mainly political, it is necessary
that the troops in the field be im-
pressed with the fact that they mus‘
not cause unnecessary damage tr.

peasant prbperties, especially life.-

The destruction of entire peasant
villages by burning or bombing aids
only the Viet Cong. This unnecessary
destruction is unwarranted for both
political and humanitarian reasons.

One possible solution to this prob-
lem would be the enforcement of
existing regulations against bru-
tality and the creation of new regu-
lations to cover this irregular type
of warfare. But regulations must be
.coupled with education of the troops.

Step Forward ._

A modified version ofthe fortified
hamlet system, which was not too
successful, has now been started in
South Vietnam. A small task force
of South Vietnamese and Americans
will be sent into villages which are
under the inﬂuence of the Viet Cong.

Thege teams will attempt to per-
suade‘the villagers that the govern-
ment does care and is willing to aid
them in creating better conditions
for themselves. The learn will at-
tempt to have the villagers set up
their own defense system.

,These teams will concentrate on

both political and military problems.

as the Viet Cong have been doing
for years. It is generally agreed
that only by havingthe villagers take
part in their own political and mil-
itary problems can we expect to win
their loyalty to the government.
If the guerllla forces can be sep-
arated from the villages, the Viet
Cong will lose a prime source of
their manpower and ability to hide
among the villagers. Once they are
isolated in this manner, they can be
more easily defeated militarily.

Viet Cong Premises

One of the basic appeals of the
Viet Cong has been their promise of
a better life in the future.They have
pointed to the corrupt and some-
times brutal treatment the peasants
have been receiving to supporttheir
claims.

The government, on the other
hand, has not effectively promised
anything and has continued its pol-
icies toward the peasants. Only by
demonstrating that the government
has something to offer without un-
necessary brutallty is their any
chance of winning the people in
South Vietnam.

Paton Feels Power of love
South Africa’s Only Solution

by Mrs. Marianne Kennedy

SOUTH AFRICAN 'I'li’.-I(jlf/)l’: 'I'Iu! Lifi' uru/ 'I'imr'a 11/ Jun llufnu'yr. By
Alan Pawn. Scribnl'r's. 11/5 pp. $10.00. Yon Fir/inn.

“It is my own belief,” Alan Paton has written, "that the only power
which can resist the power of fear is the power of love. It’s a weak
thing and a tender thing; men despise and deride it, but I look for the
day when in South Africa we shall realize that the only lasting and
worthwhile solution of our grave and profound problems lies not in
the use of power, but in that understanding and compassion without
which human life is an intolerable bondage, condemning us all to an
existence of violence, misery and fear.”

This is his cry in “Cry, the Beloved Country" of twenty years ago.
It is his cry in “South African Tragedy.” In the introduction to the
earlier work, dedicated in the South African edition to Jan Hofmeyr,
Lewis Gannet anticipated that one day Alan Paton would "engage in

Just such an effort to recall South Africa to the vision" of this great
liberal native Dutch African or Afrikaner statesman, who in 1939 was
Deputy Prime Minister under General Smuts.

An important part of the South African tragedy, in Mr. Paton’s View,
is that brilliant Rhodes scholar, Jan Hofmeyr, whose Christianity for-
mulated and governed his political liberalism, died in 1948, the year
of General Smuts’ astonishing defeat. Because of this, Mr. Paton
maintains, the old Afrikaner policy of “survival and separation"
grew stronger until, under the aegis of Dr. Hendrik Verwoerd, the
beautiful Afrikaans language seems to the world to be limited to ugly
words synonymous with white supremacy, such as “apartheid,”
(a-part-hate) and "baaskaap," (bahz-lrop) words which suggest their
denotations, and which in their connotations define economic and
political problems for the hundreds of thousands of Bantu, "coloureds,"
and "Asians," (fndlan immigrants), which dwarf our own racial prob-
lems by comparison.

Ironically, the tragedy seems to center more around the ruling
Afrikaners who are failing to see their own enslavsment to an unjust,
unworkable, and therefore, doomed policy. George Orwell in an essay
about imperialism, “Shooting an Elephant," says “i perceive that when
the white man turns tyrant It is his own freedom which he destroys.”
This is the South African tragedy.

It is characteristic of Alan Paton, who gave up a career teaching
children of the rich to become the leading authority on penal reform in
his country, and whose generous nature is further revealed lnhls
writing, that he would offer so much more than biography in this book.
There is a course in the geography of a rich and beautiful country with
the "fairest caps in the whole circumference of the earth." There is
a study in political science; in ethnology, presented in the kind of
creative writing which has enough of the feelot poetry to be enthralling.
There is, finally, in the overall consideration, the servicehe has ren-
dered his beloved country in presenting this tragedy. Perhaps the re-
sulting catharsis will hasten the inevitable, Perhaps the tradition the
Proud Afrikaners Justly wish to preserve will emerge as indestructible
as their diamonds and as pure as their gold, when the dross of political

tyranny is consumed.

is long list of. successes in the
Bethlehem Central High School aud-
itorium. Both the Latham commun-
ity Players and Schenectady Civic
Theatre have had the distinction of
producing quality shows in those
relatively distant areas. Lastly, The
Galaxy Players, a splinter group of
the Schene’ctady Theatre, and a rela-
tive newcomer, has already been
responsible for some fine shows.
Their production of “A Resounding
Tinkle" was recently praised highly
in this column. "

All of these groups are open for
membership, and are recommended
for those with experience and for
those who would like to learn about
the'theatre. Most of their produc~
tions are of the finest quality, and
i suggest you avail yourself to the
opportunity of seeing as many of
them as possible.

“Primer” is well put together and
varied.

“For Esther," by “A Profane
Ascetic” is technically unified, but
a little confusing. The main idea is
expressed by the use of a simlle
which has been carried too far.
Because of this the piece loses its
dramatic effect.

Other-Development Reversed

The problem of over-development
in the above selection is reversed
in “Moods of A Go Go Girl" by
Lana Noury. The emotions of the
girl are expressed easily and
smoothly. However, none of these
are developed to any extent.

“The Super Sifter," by Jo Lynn
Wein, and “Ashes From A Long
Dead Fire," by Kathleen Niles,
deal with the emotions of children.
Miss Wein's piece, told in the first

child’s reactions to other children.
The story is quite thought-provok-
ing.

Eddy Interesting

\“The Rape of Proserpine" by
James F. Eddy is very challenging.
The story is interesting and Mr.
Eddy’s use of words is noteworthy.

"flow I Lost My Blanket," by
Yale Sussman, is a bit stilted in
narration. The story is complex,
perhaps too complex for its size.

‘ Promise

“Soon It’s Gonna Rain,” by Sam
Cypressi, is a very well written
story which shows promise of even
better work from Mr. Cypressi in
the future.

This year’s "Primer" is a good
