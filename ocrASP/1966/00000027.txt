 majority Of you felt like i did When the'team’s official

roster 'camerout-ithe Danes were in fora rough season.

Wi ‘ {steam almost completely-devoid oi‘ 6-footers

bunch" of .cagers that; had never played together

be ﬁre. "Doc" Sauer‘s wrought a miracle. Hecoached,
exhorted.’»and terrifiedvhis team to a veryrespectable

13-9 slate. while we fans-could do no more than shake

our heads in amazement. « ' “ I

It was a team of clutch performers - as seen in the
squad's four one-point wins and two-point champion-
ship win over Siena — and it was a team of dedicated

workers. The Danes went through a long four month
season with only eight .players. It‘was a season that

__ ran through Christmas vacation, ex‘am period, and in’-
tersession, and yet the hoops'ters finished strong, cop-
ping three out of their final four games. _

‘ To the entire team — Jim Constantino, Mike Bloom,
Mike Crocco, Lonnie Morrison. Larry Marcus, Marty
O'Donnell, Tom Doody, and TimJursak—e andespecially
to Coach Saue'rs — our most sincere and heartiest con-
gratulations on a truly remarkable season. On occasion
you fellows may have been out-classed and out—scored,
but you were never out-fought.

I was misunderstood last week by several people who
thought I was degrading our cheerleaders. I-was by no
means doing that, and, in fact, I hold the girls in very
high esteem. I respect anyone who tries time and again
[to elicit support for a team fromabunch of dead—heads.
Since our school doesn’t support its cheerleaders, why
have them at all? I’m sure these gals get tired of
hearing only their voices echo throughout the Washing-
ton Avenue Armory.

Us a spectacle I’m tired of seeing, especially when
a school likn New Paltz and its cheerleaders come all
the way up to Albany and drown out our cheers. I feel
it's nt.—tier .ml "to have them at all and let the other

schools inst imagine why.

 by Lonnie Morrison’s shooting. rebounding, and play-making. the Albany
State Great Dane basketball team ended its season on a happynote by winning its
last two games of the season. The vidtories, came in a thrilling 72-71 overtime

victory over Hobart on March 2 in an away contest and an 80-62 decision over
UticaCollege in an andther away game last Saturday night.‘ The hoopsters finishe

the season with a 13-9 record with no seniors on the. team.

In ’the Hobarte contest,
Morrison stele the ball with
only 19 seconds left, was
fouled. and made a free
throw with 8 seconds re-
maining to give the Danes
the victory.

The home team led at the half;
37-35, but with 3 minutes leit, Mike
Crocco's basket put State ahead 63-
61. Hobart’s Andy Rhoades tied the
score with a few seconds remain-
ing to send the game into overtime.

In the extra period Hobart went
out in trout, but a bucket by State's
Larry Marcus tied the score at 71-
all. Hobart then went into a treeze
at 1:45 to wait for the last shot, but
Morrison’s clutch steal spoiled
everything for the 6-13 statesmen.

Bloom High With 20

For Albany, Mike Bloom was high
scorer with 20 points, followed by
Crocco who had 19. Marcus chipped
in with 10, Morrison 7, Marty O’Don-
nell and Jim Constantino 6 each,
and Tim Jursak 4.

For the home squad, Rhoades was
high with 23, with John Sparkes
adding 17 and Dan Grift‘en 11.

Saturday night’s victory over
Utica was relatively easy as the
cagers led throughout the whole
game except for the opening basket.

versity Friday, utter eleven and a
halt years of service. Bolllolnedthe
University on September 1, 1054,
and since that tithe, has managed the

    

the bookstore.

When asked why he has decided
to leave the University, he stated that
any move would naturally have to he
to one's beneiit. For him, the new
position will “be less at a chore,"
in the respect that there will be
“no more nights and Saturdays" in
the store.

Bell said the bookstore at the
new campus will be “more than
adqunte.” It should therefore serve
the student body well.

Concerning the job with the Uni-
vorsity, Boll commented mainly on
his work with the students: Pri-
marily, utter eleven and a halt
yours, this has been a vary on-
‘Joyuhle position and aplousunt ox-
porionce. it has been tun working
