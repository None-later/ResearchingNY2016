' Salary for President

When the new government was formed
last May, it was decided that‘the presi-
céive a salary.

One of the many reasons for this de-
cision was the expectation of having a
secretary for Student Association who
would perform most of the paper work
and eliminate many ,of the hours the
president would put in. '

This expectation came true in part
when Central Council hired a full time
secretary to do the paper work for the
Student Association.

However, even with the acquisition of
a secretary the number of hours in-
volved with the position of president has
not decreased depreciably.

There is very little need toljustify a

‘salary'fonthe office. The number of
hours and the tremendous responsi-

bility that goes with the position merits
a salary.

One of the arguments, always brought
up when salaries for a student are dis—
cussed. is that someone might take a
salaried position just for the money.
But this arguement is ridiculous when
one stops to think of the hourly wage.

No one in his right mind would take
a job with so many headaches and a
wage less than fifty cents an hour.

Efforts commented

We would like to congratulate the
men of Alpha Pi Alpha fraternity on
their efforts to conduct a blood drive

Now we will observe a typical Albany Grammar School

 

   
 

for the soldiers in Vietnam. ,

The brothers worked hard in setting"
up the program, which was held in Bru-
bacher Lower Lounge last Wednesday
and Thursday, and were able tofattain

-lblood'-‘donations from over 300 students

and faculty members.

The idea behind the drive was not one
of endorsement of the ideology involved
in the war, but was to show concern
for the fact that many U. S. soldiers
in Vietnam are' dying.

Their efforts are a fine example of
some of the outstanding activities the
Greeks on campus have been involved
in this year.

Need for Newsletters

In recent weeks there has been much
discussion about the. communication
problem on campus. Many candidates for
class office said that they would try to
get a newsletter published to, inform the
members of their class of recent and
upcoming events.

A proposal was also brought up at the
Central Council meeting to have a similar
instrument of communication to inform
the student body of policy decisions,etc.
of student government,

These proposals we feel are asslnine..
There exists on campus several medias
of communication which can publicize
news and events. There is no need for
a waste of money on new media.

These people with vast amounts of
energy to waste should stop by one of
the communications now on campus.
We are sure there will be something
for them to do.

City Interests Served

Thus the implication'is that the
interests of the people of this city
have been served at the expense‘of
the county as a whole'for a long
enough time to spoil any breed of
folks.

However, Albany only further en-
trenched herself with the coming of
larger blocks of immigrants, the
Italians and the Irish, during the
latter half of the 19th century and
into the early part of the 20th.

One effect of the advent of poor
foreigners is the political machine’s
opportunity for .greuter headway
through smoothing their adjustment
to a new setting and a new country.

The plot thickens as we see one _
party with its highly effective ma- 3
chine move in and take over the
only other two cities in the county,
Cohoes and Watervliet. The upshot,
of course, was the domination of
the county by one city and its party.

Shift the Burden
in more concrete terms, this one
city and its machine have been able
to shift many hundred thousands of
dollars of their responsibility for the
tax burden to the county at large.
Perhaps the whole county is being
hoodwinked. More likely is the hy-

Finally, we have a substantial
area of the city inequitably repre-
sented, and thereforeythe super-
vision of the city falls to whom-
ever it is, who does not reside in
those two largest sections of the
upper middle class in Albany.

The people of Albany are living
our one long, hypocritical lie. They
live in the number one city and take
the shabbiet way out. It would seem
that this would continue as long as
it is worth it to them.

Yet, the symptons of the sloveuly

the county may still continue to
degenerate; '  "

To file Editor:

As a member of thc oust of “Stop

upon a letter llpponl'lngin'l‘uesllny's
issue.

For the unification of nil those
unknowing or pscullo-scphisllcntoli
hoopla, i would like to announce that
it is by all lllollllH proper and highly
(liisil'itlllo that all lunllonco upplnull

Anyone who has BVill‘ ntleulloli u
lil'ornlwny musical will know that this
llllppuns all the time. This summer
l attended the Itiilh’li‘lll “Funny Gill,"
and tile lllllllottltu stopped the show
for nearly five minutes with rlppluuso
after one number.

Theatre is u colnlnuulcuiing cilu
put’ltlllilo, lillli there is no greater
achievement for an actor than to
create ll i‘llitilnl‘l between the spec-
tutor and tile litll‘litl‘illitl'.

Audience pur‘tivinnlloll should be
spontaneous: if one feels llkoluugil-
lug, lullgili if one fools llkenllpluuli-
lug, cpllluulll

This is lilo only way an audience
can let the people on tho slugs
know their approval and enjoyment.

it is extremely difficult to give an
enthusiastic performance to attenti-
pan audience.

CArronsl

Furthermore, l! the audience feels
it is necessary to restrain their
enthusiasm, they will also enjoy the
show less.

Thus, on behalf ofltllpcl'fcl-lnol-s,
I say please applaud, relax, and let
go. This Is the only way that cvol'y-
one concerned can get tile must but
of tile experience of theatre.

To the Editor,

l question very seriously tho lol-

It is very definitely the custom,

‘ Central Council meeting Thursday
night was th'e proposed key system.’ '
’ Eleanor ' Diener, member of the.

Living Area Affairs Commission,
introduced the resolution to, the
Council. .

' The key system has been disr
cussed and developed lﬂ'l com-
mittee headed by Lynn Merella.
she was present at the meeting to
answer any questions which the
members might have.

As the discussion began most
questions were concerned with the
reason the girl must have the key
in by 6 a.m. if the hours were ex-
tended that much anyway. The ex-
planation was that it was merely a
way of placing some control on the
return of the key.

Ovemlghts Unchanged

If the girl were to stay out later
than 6 a.m., it would be an over-
night. The restrictions on overnighis
are not being changed. Also, it was
explained the key system would not
apply to first semester. freshmen.
They would maintain the same cur-~
few that is new enforced.
