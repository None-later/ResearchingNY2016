Sitye-level' AMIA CriticiSm

At the beginning of first semester, AMIA partici-
pants elected four officers to run the AMIA program

for the year. And yet we found it increasingly difficult

to get statistics and standings for publication in the
,ASP. Finally, through a direct appeal to the various
commissioners of the AMIA sports, we were able to
get a small amount of information. |
For instance, last week we ran the standings of the
five AMIA basketball leagues for the first time all
year, and then they were still amost two weeks behind
schedule. And if it were not for commissioner Kirk
Ellis’ efforts, we would not have had them at all.
One would think that at least one of the four officers
elected last fall would have as his responsibility the
releasing of AMIA statistics. .Or is that asking too
much? We do not feel that it is up to the individual
commissioners to relay the information to us — their
job is to keep the league running. ~ .
Also, two weeks ago I was to have attended one of
the AMIA’s scheduled weekly meetings to explain how

'  ASP would handle AMIA sports. I say I"was to

have attended” a meeting because only two commis-
sioners and myself showed up. And this, I am told, is a
regular happening.

If the,elected AMIA officials accepted their jobs to

have something to put down on applications, question-

naires, etc., then all I have to say is — you’ve got a
lot of gall, an awful lot. a ‘

grappier was

scoringa 19-12 win in the semi-finals of the NCAA

cellege divisioii' Wrestling Championships last. Satur-
day, Rummy'Macias, president of the National coaches
Association told Dane Coach Joe'Garcia “that was the

most beautiful exhibition
coaChing.” ’ f
And so it was with Crow.
as he became the first
wrestler in State history
to become anational cham-
pion, winning decisivelyall
four of his 123. pound
matches at Marketo. Minn.

Crow is a transfer student from
Cornell University. He graduated
from Linton High ‘School where he
was the Outstanding Wrestler in
the sectionals in both his junior
and senior years. In his senior
year, Crow was undefeated in 25
matches, scoring 20 pins. ,

He earned three varsity letters
at Linton, serving as captain his
senior year.

Crow finished second in tiie Eas-
tern Sectional championshipsin both
his freshman and sophomore years
at Cornell, earning .the school’s
Most Valuable wrestler award as
a soph.

He was also picked by the coach
to the Coaches All-America team in
" Wrestling News," a popular wrest-
ling magazine.

Unhappy at Cornell

Crow was unhappy with the pres-
sures he was subjected to at Cornell,
so he transferred to Albany. He
had already been good friends with
Garcia from his high school days.

In his first half-season at State,
Crow was undefeated in six outings,
including one tie.

Perhaps the most amazing thing
about the 123 pounders NCAA win
is the men he beat. Here they are
in order:

Preliminary: Leslie Kempf, met-
ropolitan Chamoion,v1965-66. Third
in the Coast Guard tournament, 1965;
11-1-0 dual record this year. Crow
won an 8-2 decision.’

Quarterfinal: Davis Johnson; All-
Lutheran Conference Champ, junior
and senior years; four year dual
mark of 32-0-0; 1965-66 mark of
15-3. Crow pinned him, 3:18.

Semi-finals: Rick Sanders; Port-
land State; 1965 NAIA National
champion, Most Valuable Wrestler
in that tourney; Oregon 123 pound

 

I’ve seen in .16 years of
champion; member of United states
AAU team that toured in Bulgaria;
1‘6-0-0 record for the year. Crow
won, 19-12.

College; runner-upein .NCAA last
year; Illinois conference champion;
undefeated in four years in dual
meets. Crow pinned .him at 0:42
of overtime. -

v Olympic Trial:

In 1964, Crow finished fourth in
the Olympic trials, narrowly failing
to make the team.

The 21-year old Crow is a Math
maior, physics minor; he hopes to
teach someday. .

Coach Garcia says that Crow is
always being asked for help from
younger grapplers, eager to learn
his conditioning habits and wrest-
ling techniques; “he is always will-
ing to help them out."

M YSKANIA Chairman

Discusses New Role

MY SKANIA elected Ray
Cianfrinl chairman, Jim
Constantino, vice chair-
man, Susan Wade secre-
tary and Eleanor Dienor
treasurer at its first meet-
ing Wednesday night.

When asked about the purpose of
the 1966-67 MYSKANIA, Cianfrinl
replied, “First, I want to stress

pose, since it is not defined, We
would like it to become an overseer,
for the University. We should be
able to look upon any group or indi-
vidual within Student Association and
be able to help it with any prob-
Isms.”

Place tor Aid
"This is a new university with a
new government; therefore, many
groups may need help. We expect
to be the place to come for this
ll

that it will not be a strictly non- am

academic honorary. We expect to
become involved with all aspects of
university life."

Special Events Board has
announced that the New York trip
will not attend the Philharmonic or
the ballot at Lincoln Center as

Also the trip to the Shakespeare
Theatre in Sti‘ntford, Connecticut
has been rescheduled for May 20.
The production that will be shown
on Saturday evening will be “Ful-

Aside from the production there
is ii museum at the theatre which
contains one of the largest collec-
tions of Shakespearean costumes in
the United States. Many photographs
from productions of previous yours

the theatre ticket is $' .50.

The New York City trip is still
planned for April 23, find the Gug-
genheim is still included in the trip,
Further information concerning
what will replace the Lincoln Cen-
ter performance and what the cost
will be is forthcoming. The burs will
still be $2.20 for those who have
paid student fax and $4.25 for others.

Cianfrini added, “A big concern
of mine 15 school unity. As guard-
ians of the freshman class, MYS-
KANIA should draw the classes to-
gether as closely as possible. I
think one way of doing this is to
evolve a system similar to Rival-
ry'rr

“MYSKANIA should be able to
investigate any area that could lin-
prove school unity. The best way
to draw students and administra-
tion closer together is to have MYS-
KANIA work with the administration
in formulating ideas on how to bring

both class tics and ties between
students and administration to-
gather."

Active In Functions
“Another thing,” said Cianfrini,
"I would like to see MYSKANIA do
is take an active part in university
life. Members of MYSKANIA have
all been involved in Various func-
tions and have diverse interests.”

"MYSKANIA members will be
going to any organization meeting
that they fuel necessary so that they
know what is going on. By doingthis
we could become informed and could
make suggestions to help them out."

He also said, “MYSKANIA us a
whole hasn‘t mot forinnllyto discuss
what our purpose and role will be
but once we do define our role I
hope first it will be u guideline for
other MYSKANIA’s to follow in the
future."

Finally Cinnfrini concluded, "The
main point I want to stress is that
MYSKANIA should not be put aside
as a non-academic honorary now
that it is no longer :1 Judicial body.”

Requests Exceed Revenue
Budget requests to date total
33,000. Conservative estimates of
student tax revenue are for only
$100,000. Consequently, almost all
organizations are being asked to
voluntarily cut their budget re-
uesis.

If sufficient reductions cannot be
made voluntarily by the groups,
Central Council will be forced to
make the cuts itself, or to raise
student tax. All efforts are being
made, however, to make unneces-
sary to raise student tax for the
