Budgets and Needed Revenue

Approving the budgets of the various Student Asso-
ciation organizations seems to be a greater problem
than anyone anticipated. Most of the organizations
have submitted budgets equal to or surpassing the
amount they asked for last year.

The repercussions of this are obvious. The budget
committee will have no choice but to out many items
from budgets even if they are ncessary.

The reason for these actions is obvious. The uncer-
tain future of student tax necessitates the curbing of
expenditures by organizations.

The obvious solution to this problem would be to make
student tax compulsory. This would allow StudentAsso-
ciation to know how much revenue itwould have to work
with. ‘

Steps are now being taken by members of Centra
Council to do this; however, it is uncertain what the
chances of them succeeding or when student tax would
become compulsory.

What is needed is other sources of revenue for Stu

dent Association. '
eeeooeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeoeeeeeoa

For the past few years athletic tax, which is levied
along with student tax, has produced a surplus of over
$50,000. One hypothesis that can be drawn from this
surplus is that the money awarded towards athletics
is not used entirely.

We would like to see an investigation of these books.
If this hypothesis is found true, we would like to see
Central Council attempt to persuade the proper auth-
ority of the need StudentAssociationhas forthis money.

President Collins has already indicated that he feels
Student Association is of vital necessity to the Univer-
sity. Since he does hold this opinion, we feel that a

. transfer of money from the athletic surplus to Student
Association is not unreasonable.

TOWN TWEED

‘ “Kn experimental projectivill be
tried“ Camp Dippikill on April
22-324. Students and faculty will get
together in a most informal atmos-

phere to consider the topic for dis- ‘

cussion, “The Crisis in Communi-
cation."

The purpose of the weekend is
to allow for a more personal and
informal approach to academic mat-
ter. All too often the impersonal
settingof the University sterilizes
the more exciting aspects of the
learning experience. The Dippikiii
weekend hopes to revive some of
that excitement.

To this end, a well integrated
program has been arranged, a pro-
gram that will allow for both lec-
tures and volleyball, for discus-
sion groups and hikes in the Adir-
ondacks.

Dr. John Resenbach of the Edu-
cation department has agreed to
deliver the keynote address on the
first night. Also, Dr. Thomson
Littleflold and Dr. Theodore Adams

_ of the'Eninsh department as well as.

ment have agreed to lead discussion
groups. it Is hoped that several more
faculty members will attend.

The group will leave the school
Friday the 22nd and return on the
following Sunday afternoon. six
meals will be served starting with
Friday supper and ending with abox
lunch on Sunday. Three discussion
groups are planned.

Facilities at Dipplikill are ade-
quate. Cooking will be done by the
group itself. Water, heat and elec-
tricity are provided. Dormitory-
type beds_ are at the farmhouse;
sleeping bags are recommended.
Due to thesize of the farmhouse,
only 30 students will be able to
attend.

The cost of the weekend (to cover
food and transportation) shall be
five dollars. If you are interested In
participating in this idea, contact
either Stu Salomon or Bill Gross
at 463-7768. They will provide a
simple, but necessary application
form.

Bad Aspects :OfLIAlbany Remain
With Preservation Of Good Points

by Jane Schneider

From the Broadway hit of 1950,
and Hollywood production of 1955,
“Guys and Dolls" comes the song
“The Oldest Established Perma-
nent Floating Crap Game in New
York." In it is the immortal line
“We’ve gotta have a game or we’ll
die of shame." The stage is set in
blacks, blues and purples, signify-
lng the underworld. , '

At one time in Albany there was
such a shameful game that the U.S.
District Attorney made an investi-
gation of the situation in this town.
The year was 1929, and Dan O’Con-
nell was implicated as the ringleader
of “the, baseball pool,” as it was

' known throughout the Middle Atlantic

states and New England.

Convicted

He was convicted as the director
of the " Dummy Player Operation."
When he had a chance to appeal,
he passed it up and instead served
:1 three months sentence.

Tile way the “Dummy Player
Operation" worked was this.

A person would buy a ticket from
a salesman. The ticket would have
five names of baseball teams on it.
At the end of the week the ticket
with the teams which had scored the
most runs would Win. New say John
Doe won $500.

The boys who paid off would tell
him there was another winner and
that he would have to split the
money. The second winner did not
exist, hence the dummy player.
Dan O’Connell not only sanctioned
the pool; It was the Democratic
organization’s pool.

JOSEPH S. SILVERMAN
Edvior-In-Chiel

Somehow the idea of pleasesome
activities held under the auspices

.of 'the'inachine is an old, old as-

tablishment in Albany. It reaches
not only back into history, but across
class and career lines.
1 One' radical reform politician once
said of the city of Albany that Its
businessmen were “commercial
whores" and that “the old man'
was really the “old madame.” This
makes Albany something other than
a town,‘ somethingless than ahome.
And so- the sun always seems to
be rising in Albany, as far as the
people and their keeper are con-
cerned.

Other Aspects of Pleasure

But what other aspects of pleas-
ure arev'available besides the goug-
ing of county taxes, the seduction
of loyal citizens, and dandling of
Dan?‘ - I

Certainly there is no fun like
arriving at Union Station, or attend-
ing any large show at the Armory,
or attempting to find a place to
skate in winter, or to play tennis
in the spring or to swim in the
summer.

In the fall, one could risk one’s
life skateboarding over cracked
sidewalks or around the pothole-
abysses in the streets.

Then there is the intricate parlor
game, unique to Albanians, of
camouflagtng trash and passing it
off as garbage so that the city will
take it away free.

Oh, there are some unfunny op-
portunities around Albany as well.
If one were a resident of the South
Mall area a year or two years ago,
one might have been evicted and

forced to play “musical houses.”

Lived Elsewhere

Or, if one lived elsewhere in the
city at the time, one might have
taken on the great guessing game
of "Mali plans, Mali plans, who’s
got the Mall plans?”

Actually, the whole town is one
gigantic fun house.

But let’s be fair.

There does exist the Albany Sym-
phony and it does an excellent job;
witness the concert, March 14.

Also, within a half hour’s drive
or ‘a bit farther if one is Lake
George bound, are numerous lakes
to which Albanians flee come sum-
mer.

There is a beautiful bus terminal
equipped with both bar and kitchen
to serve one as he takes in the View
of a splendid-specimen of Flem-
isii architecture.

One can’t overlook the many cozy
taverns, well appointed, especially
now that Hedrick’s brewery is
closed.

Well-kept Washington park draws
people from every walk of life who
enjoy its natural beauty and rustic
ﬂavor. And the Park brings to mind
the marvelous tulip beds and the
famous Tulip Pageant.

Finally, the purity and quality of
Albany water has long been a corri-
mon source of joy to the residents.

Now one question. These good
points of Albany are old-fashioned
and traditional. Somehow they have
persevered or been preserved.

But the cold, hard reality ofbeing
a modern city with citizens proudof
having their homes here remains.

What of the future, Dandies?

The purpose of the Model Gen-
eral Assembly was to reflect the
procedures and operations of its
counterpart In the UN. Delegates
therefore make themselves some-
what expert on the role played by
the nation they are representmg in
the General Assembly. I

800 Students Attend
Attending this conference were
eight hundred students from 105
colleges and universities.

On Thursday afternoon the dele-
gates received a two hour briefing
on the Ukrainian position. This
briefing was held at the Soviet Em-
bassy in N.Y.C.

They were told that the only prob-
lem that the Soviet Union faces
today is in agriculture; and that
there is only one real China even
though it is somewhat misinformed
at present.

The delegates were informed that
anyone in the Soviet Union may speak
out and dissent as long as they are
not dissenting against the state,
because subversion is not and cannot
be allowed.

An example of this policy lies in
the conviction of two writers on the
grounds of subversion, smuggling,
and income tax evasion. One of the
writers lost his citizenship due to
his “Fascist Remarks against the
motherland.”

General Opinion
The general opinion of young
people in the U.S.S.R. is that re-
ligion is unnecessary although any-
one wishing to practice his religion
is free to do so.

Delegates reported that their ad-
visor sldestepped a query asking
whether peaceful coexistence meant
an eventual Communist takeover of
the world. He stated that you cannot
export a revolution and only when

sion of Red China to the UNwas
defeated. A motion to censor South
Africa, Rhodesia, and other coun-
tries, that trade with them was also
defeated. _ ‘

Representative Jonathan Bingham
spoke, affirming Congressional sup-
port for the goals and operations of
the UN. ’

Main Address

The main address Was given by.
Dr. Soelaiman Tajibnapls, an offi-
cer of the UN Political and Security
Affairs Dept. He stressed the im-
portance of regional treaty organi-
zations such as OAS in the field of
maintaining world security.

He also traced the development
and aims of the UN Peace Missions
and stated that they have no mili-
tary objectives.

He stated that these missions are
only stationed in a country request-
ing them and are composed of troops
from non-committed nations.

All students who participated in
the Assembly were members oftthe
Forum of Politics. Telegrams were
received from President Johnson,
Robert Kennedy, and Mayor Lind-
sey wishing the Assembly success.
