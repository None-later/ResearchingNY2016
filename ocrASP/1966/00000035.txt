touring and publicizing its merits.

Throughlfthese' three years, Mr.
William Hudson, .Jthe band's direc-
tor, 'has 'unfaiteringly pushed for
unity and maturity,.,in the Band.
Through Mr. _ ,’
and efforts, the Band'has f‘grown

' up" from afifty-piece,disorganized

group of students who, met once a
week, to an ei'ghty piece, organized
group of maturing musicians, who
regularly attend the two weekly re-
hearsals.

’ Rgcent Development of Band
The results of a musical organi.
zation are dependent upon two fac-
tors, the conductor and the players.
The attitudes and interests thathave
developed along a positive channel in
the last three years have helped to
place the band in the position of es-
teem it is in now. 
'If alumni of the Band were to
attend a concert of this year's Band,
they wouldbedelightfully surprised]
Those of you, presently here, who
have the opportunity to be in the
vicinity of Richardson, third floor,
late Monday and Thursday afternoons
(whene the band rehearses) would
also be quite pleased at the musi-
cal proficiency this organization is
developing. . .
Moturing Program ‘ '
Therefore, as the Band is ma-
turing, its programming is also
maturing. Last year, the Band
started playing to audiences outside
the University by playing 'At high
schools. 1. a“. 3

This year, after a' successful ‘

University Concert in December,
and an extremely fine concert for
Milne High School, as well as for
the University in February, the
Band has "takenla, giant step." lt
has begun its touring concerts... . '

This first step came about by
playing a concert at the State Uni-
versity College at Oneonta on March
11. This event proved to be a great
milestone for the Band as its aud-z
lence was quite sufficiently satis-
fied, thereby expanding the general
audience of the Band.

Pro|octed Plans
What do all these progressing
steps mean? in essence, they basi-
cally mean that the University Band
is ready, willing, and able to dis-
card its "old reputation" and to

niversity in September, 1966;" ~

Certainly, pride has grown among

members of the organization, and

.pride in taking' part in the function‘-

ings of the Band can also be seen
on the part of Mr. Hudson. Surely
this feeling has been aided along by
remarks from various musicians of
this area. _

Bond Progress Commended

For example, aprominent choir
director and organist in this area
has been quoted [as citing what a
remarkable improvement was made
by the Band in the interim of the
December and February concerts.
He went on to say that such pro-
gress is quite amazing.

Another comment has been stated
by a prominent cellist of the acne.
nectady Symphony. His commend-
able statement centeréd around the
idea that this Band is better than
many 6A graded bands of the area.
He foresees that in the near future
this Band will be the "showpiece
of the area."

Concert Here in May
Tile Band will be able to show its
“new face" at the May 19 concert.
At this time, two of the selections

.of the Band will be the "Testament
.of Freedom" by Randall Thompson.

This will be done in connection with
the Statesmen.

‘- Also performed will be the
"Trombone Concerto,” in which
Wayne Sheley of the Eastman School
of Music will be the soloist. Future
plans of the Band include to continue
expanding ofits selections, its musi-
cal._~competence, ,and its audience.

If Winter comes, can Springbe farbehind? P. B. Shelley

Spring is a state of mind.

When the seasons shift and the drifts pass into beads

of sweat: when the park laughs with the echoes of

dreaming students and sweltering apartment dwellers;
when the coats are shorts and the boots are sandals
the mind takes a turn toward delight and imagination.

Spring comes to Albany with a suddcnnoss which
salutes the newly bare and always dirty streets with a
clear and refreshing view of our reality — leaving us
with an awareness that spring, though it has been be-
fore, will never be the same again.

Perhaps it to only the awakening of the conscious

after a cold and dismal sleep that creates this impres-
sion--pcrhnps it is more than we really care to dis-
cuss, and perhaps it is only for us. Somehow it is no
important that we should know why—it is only relevant
to realize that each of us is unique—and for each of us
Spring must always be an experience of the mind.
unique unto itself.

Often times an expression on campus is that the
University is going through a period of transition.
This transition is taking place through physical and
academic growth in the University. as well as growth
in scope and maturity of activities.

Members Pleased

At 2:00 p.m. on March ii, the
University Band started oh its way
to Oneonta. Two luxurious buses
were provided for this trip. (l sup-
pose the buses were to be so com-
fortable and relaxing so as to com-
fort and relax the nerves of the
players).

We were lucky that the weather
was pleasant, making the ride to
Oneonta quite delightful. Each bus
hadan flutourist" guide (defini-

tion: .person from Oneonta area) to-

provide a first-hand description of
the sights leadihg to and in Oneonta.

Arrival at Oneonta

When we arrived in Oneonta, we
had a brief tour of the city and the
two campuses of the College. We
finally disembarked from the buses
at "Old Main," the auditorium where
we were to perform that night.

Following a musicians “lot” we
realized that we should have a
warm-up period as a Band to be-

Four University Students Chosen

ilh
come acquainted with this new audi-
torium. Under Mr. Hudson’s direc-
tion we proceeded to do so.

Then, we ate a "dorm" meal at
the Oneonta College cafeteria. The
cafeteria set-up and meal was sim-
ilar to that of the Dutch Quad cafe-
teria. One exception, however, is
that the cafeteria at Oneonta does
not seat as many people as ours
does.

As we enjoyed our meal, we were
able to_meet, with, some students
from Oneonta,‘and' so therefore, we
learned of some of the aspects of
that College.

Tour of Campus

The Band members then had some
free time to tour the campus taking
particular note of the new library
facilities, new dorm complexes,and
delightful Views of the town iron!
the hill of the campus.

Concert time was 8:15. At this
time, we presented to the people of
Oneonta a very satisfactory concert.

Experience

As we left the concert hall, many
of us heard very favorable com-
ments of the concert. I believe that

The selections presented included
“Oh Freedomi” by Joe Chadabe of
the faculty here at SUNrYA. This is
a collection of civillrlghts songs
arranged in a modern, medium. Vin-
cent Persichetti’s "Psalm for
Band" and Bilik's "American Civil
War Fantasy" were parts of the
program.

Satisfaction and Prospects

The excitement and tension on
the part of the members of the Band
came to a lull as we proceeded to
mount the relaxfui buses for Albany.
'We felt that we had done a “good
job." '

The band knew also that this trip
had opened a new door, a door that
would lead to more touring trips
where we would be able to provide
an enjoyable musical evening for

our new audiences. (/

To Submit Biological Papers

by Mark Cunningham

Four students, representing the
Biology Club and SUNYA, have been
selected to give papers on their
biological research at the Eastern
College Science Conference in
Washington, D.C. from March Ill-
Apl‘ll 3.

These four are part of eleven
students representing State and its
science departments at the Con-
ference. The District of Columbia
Teachers' College in Washington
is host for the Conference.

Original Research

The papers are a result of at
least a semester’s research done by
the students themselves. They will
be presented in twenty mlullic lcc-
tures and followed by ll toll lnllluto
discussion period. The students
were selected by tho sciuncodoprlri-
mom hero.

’I‘hcll' papers dorll wiihsuclr topics
as "'l‘he Ecological Implications lio-
luiillg to tile Effects of DDT on tho
Morplloloby and Physiology of Phy-
tcnrasiigophurlans.” Students rep-
resenting l'ilo Club include John
Jauicb, Flo Club President; Nnncy
liurdlck; Rosemary Spolen; ‘Jnno
Kristoff.

’l‘he Bio Club, since iis‘l'rrol'~
gulllzution in 1008, has ntiolnptud
to "promote a greater interest in
the pursuit of biological science"
through social and scientific ac-
tivltles.

lt sponsors many field trips to
such places as 'Camp' Dippikili and
to lthode island, where the mem-
bers studied marine biology. At
these outings “everybody sticks his
nose into nature” to gain a common
sense insight into the life around
them.

Various Activities 4

The Bio Club also sponsors lec-
tures with faculty, undergraduates,
and grad students as lecturers on
topics oforiglnal research done here
at Albany. Tile Club has participated

.‘ ‘u

with the Biology departments of St.
ltose and Union in various activities.
Among these was attendance at an
operation ll't'Albany Medical Center
and a lecture by Sister Clarence or.
St. Rose on her work with cancer
research.

in these activities, which enable
a person interested in biology to
find out more about the “common
sense" side of nature and of bio-
logy, the Biology Club hopes to be
of service to the student, the Uni-
versity, and the realm of science.

V by Lola Strong

First off, I was lying. 1 could not
possibly explain my emotions as a

musician and a creator to you, the .

unschooled. It can't be done. Sowhat
follows that? PM have to teach you,
right?

Well,.v.‘how does one go about
teaching creativity? Is this a pos-

sibility? Again, the ‘answer is no. ~

But What I can do is try and show
you "all soniethlng about jazz and
thus show you-something about cre-
ativity. This .means that lam going
to teachl MLEli This goes against
every ‘one of Lou’s Laws. Feel
honored, Unschooled People, you are
about to become the pupils of zlou
Strong ("Big Deal," said the soft
sultry voice).

Jazz is a Very difficult topic to
try and teach due to the fact that
it’s _ unteachable. Jazz is feeling
more than form. Now, we all know
that it is impossible to teacll feel-
ings so I guess I’m stopped before
i even start. Guess again! I'm going
to try my best and do ltanyway (fool
that I am).

What is jazz? It’s the desire of
a musician to express his own ideas
and teelings on a piece of lnusic
which very possibly he didn’t write.
He is intrigued by a melody and
wants to express his feelings on it.
So, rather than playing it the way
it is'written, he improvises on the
original theme. Many people have
said that this is a distortion of the
original, but is this necessarily so?
Do you have to be held to some-
one else‘s representation ofan idea?

it Let’s take an example. Take a
song like “Witchcraft.” Now, off-
hand, I- don't know just who the
original composer was, but there
have beell'somany variations on this
themea'of a woman's successful se-
duction of a man, that it would take
ten issues of this column to name
all of them. Are they all distor-
tions? I think not. I rather consider
each and every one of them a dif-
ferent interpretation of the original.
I don't think that any one of these
versions of the song are sung or
played the exact way that the com-
poser wished.

They al‘e each just ideas and em-
bellishments on the original ... the
same song but embellished and, in
a sense, rewritten. ls tilts a distor-
tion? Or is this actually the same
song with tile same mood but played
a different way? isn’t this just a
man's way of saying, “Hey, mister,
your song hit me tilts way?”

“How would you like to work for
me?”

Student Reaction Solicited ‘

To Improvements of Dippikili

Camp Board has drawn up a developmental proposal
for Camp Dippikill which. within the next few days, will
be submitted to the Student Association for approval.

The Board will also solicit

the help of the student body

through a questionnaire designed to compile data to
assist Student Association in making an intelligent de-
cision concerning Camp Board.

Students in the past few years have supported the

concept of development at Camp Dippikill by setting

aside funds in a capital construction fund. It is now
time for the present student body to make this plan a
reality. Students are requested to complete their ques-

tionnaires and return them

Although the Camp Dippikili prob-
leln has not been completely settled,
definite plans for student facilities
have been proposed. These pro-
posals are more complete and def-
inite than any plans which have been
previously drawn up and presented
to the student body.

‘ increased Use Possible.

Plans have been and are being
aimed at making Dippikili more
beautiful for student use. Aims are
such that the facilities will be as
favorable as possible ill such a
camp.

One of the drawbacks of many
State students in taking advantage of
our camp has been the lack of facil-
ities and organization. However, if
tentative plans become a reality,
Dippikili will have mucll more to
offer than it has already.

Appearance of the camp will cer-
tainly be a feature which will bene-
fit it, and make trips there even
more enjoyable than they are at the
present time.

Music Council

Unfortunately l canhot say the
same for the Music Council. if my
memory serves me correctly, it is
the Council's policy to present only
classical work. Accordingly, they
offered the Bach Aria Group.

Although i was unable to enjoy
the concert because of a bother-
some cold, there was no doubt in
my, mind that the artists were su-
purb.

Nevertheless, I feel this type of
culture, depending on whether you
felt entertained or cultured, is in-
sufficient by itself for producing
well rounded, liberally educated,
thoroughly cultured students.

Varied Music Needed
I certainly hope the Music Coun-
cil does not compare the students
with Samson: without his “long
hair," he was "nothing."

Actually, there was a good deal of
diversity last semester. Students
had the opportunity to see The Mit-
chell Tria, Ian and Sylvia and the

that i never heard of him. . '

However, i was able to obtain some
information about him. He recorded“
two albums and gave several con-.
certs along the Mohawk Valley in
cities such as Amsterdam and Glov-
ersville. r

Constantine also performed atthe
Cafe Lena. As lunderstand it, he has
a style of his own, which includes a
good voice. He should prove to be
entertaining and perhaps inspiring
to talented students in the area.

A Welcome Change

- At any rate, he should be awel-

to the local pubs by our many as-

plving is that there is too little
student support at many of the
school functions.

Anyone who disagrees with my
article about the new Kingston Trio
should go down to the co-op where
he can find one of their Capital re-
cordings in Stereo for $2.98. See if
you can find any of the old group’s
albums.

To Provide Modern Conveniences

‘ After completion, it is possible i ayailablefor lodging and enjoying

The primary and fore-
most project of Camp
Board is the completion of
the proposed lodge. It will
be supported by concrete
pillars rising from two to

to install accordion doors to divide .
the room into smaller conferencej
rooms. The lounge area may alsobe 1
used as a discussion area.

At each sideof the structure is a.
porch, which will be enclosed in

four feet off the ground, glass and screening. The porch on.
The building was con_' the southwest side of the building; winter months the building may

structed with the square as
the basic formation. This
is the more economical
way.

Lodge is Inltloi Structure

Because the lodge will be theonly
structure on the Dippikili Pond sight
for some time, it will be necessary
to house and feed the guests in this
building. Divided illto,four rooms,
the sleeping quarters will accom-
modate sixteen men and sixteen wo-
men.

Each of the two main sleeping
areas are to be divided so thatthose
wishing to retire early may do so
without being disturbed by the
others.

A modern kitchen, seventeen by
twenty-one feet, is planned so that
the guests will have plenty of nour-
ishing and well prepared food.Time
saving conveniences will be installed
so that feedingelghty or lnoropoople
will be easier.

Dining Area Versatile
The dining area may be converted
illio a multipurpose rooln. Besides
being used as a dining area, the
room may be converted illto a rec-
reatioll hall for parties, movies and
dancing.
