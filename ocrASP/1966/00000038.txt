Award Needs Changes

A bill to establish a service award, which would be
given to a student who has rendered service to the Uni-
versity or Student Association, displayedleadership and
initiative and contributed to the particular activities in
which the student has participated, was introduced at the
Central Council meeting Thursday.

 

It is necessary to have such an award because too
A often a student's achievements in the-non-academic
fields are not recognized.

However, we feel that the nature of award, as stated
in the bill, and the machinery set up to determine the
recipient should be changed. As the bill states now, a

1 student nominates himself, a faculty-adminstration
5 committee selects the winner who receives $100 and a

 

 

fﬁ certificate.
I,  In all likelihdod. the student who will be chosen,~-will
"j  be someone who has held the top position in one of the

1  more important organizations or activities on campus,
, i.e. Student Association president, ASP editor, WSUA
; station manager, etc.

This student will have been recognized already for
a his achievements. We feel that the other students in an
organization, who are not well-known but have contri-
buted to various activities, should be recognized.

There are many students on campus who merit such
an award. Therefore, we‘feel that there shouldbe more
than one award, possibly seVeral awards each of dif-
ferent stature. Money does not have to be part of the
award since the honor of receiving it should be enough.

Commissions should nominate students for this award

5 and a student-administration, committee. selected by

Central Council, should judge the candidates and select
those who deserve the award.

Dan O’Connell Plans "Redistricting
Called Gerrymande‘r By Opponents

by Jane Schneider

lil this column over the last sev-
eral weeks accusations concerning
the present situation in Albany have
been researched and found to have
roots in the past.

Some readers have asked, “Why
drag up all that old filth? \Vllat pur-
pose does it serve?”

Unfortunately, there are bitter
lessons buried in all histories.Sad-
ly or justly, no entity can escape
its history.

Those facts of Albay’s past with
regard to its machine, its leaders,
its "sold-out" citizens are more
than germane to an understanding
of the present. ,

Today, March 29, on Capitol Hill
in Albany, legally prepared objec-
tions are being filed against what
has been called the mostoutrageous
gerrymander in New York State this
century. At issue is the redistrict-
illg of Albany County, especially with
regard to the new assembly dis-
tricts.

Wilen questioned, sources con-
versant with political events on the
Hill, ilnpuled the gerrymander di-
rectly to "dummy player" Dan
O’Connell. The two assemblymen
from Albany city at present are both
Dan's "boys." One, the tool Frank
Cox, is known as a crude, rude,
absolute void. The other, Harvey
Lifset on the contrary isthird rank-

ing assemblyman as chairmali of
the inﬂuential Ways and Means com-
mittee, and yet is no less Dan's boy.

The redistricting appears to those
who are protesting it to the Court
ofAAppeals' fiveginember commis-
§ion’s plah a's' gbl'rymander to make
these two seats safe for tile re-
election of Cox and Lifset.

All communications mull be nddiuud to the editors and should be siw'ied. Communicationl should be limited to 300 words

Among those who 'drew up the
objections are the Senate Majority
Leader, Earl Brydges; Assembly
"Minority Leader Durea; Assembly
whip Bartlett and Chairman 'of Al-
bany County’s Republican party, Ed
Conway. Also, two .Bronx .reform
Democrats who rose toltheir pres-
ent positions by opposingthe O'Con-
nell twin, Buckley. The means for
tilts has been the emasculation of
any political strength and its in-
fluence on Albany other than O’Con-
nell Democrats, be lit reform or
independent or Republican.

Five municipal corporations (Co-
hoes, Colonie, Guildei‘land, Bethle-
hem and New Scotland) were sep-
arated five different ways and tied
either to overwhelmingly O'Connell
Democratic districts or to those
districts external to the domain and
out of the hair of its boss.

In explaining how this “Congress
of Vienna" plan came into being,
one source said that “such deci-
sions are not made in a‘vacudm.
Dan O'Connell is now as 'he has
always been very strong' III the
state‘s political arena. Hiscounsei

is continually sought.”

By this redistricting the people
of Albany loses not only three of
the present ’7 senators and four of
the present twelve assemblymen by
way of "delousing." By the trun-
cation those very five parts of Al-
bany, the people of Albany lose the
most vibrant, hopeful parts of their
own corporate county.

When a map of the county is con-
sulted, it shows these five entities
surround the city of Albany on the
north, south and west, while the
Hudson placidly runs by on the east.

The new redistricting fragments
Albany county lllto five new dis-
tricts. As a result, the people of
Albany County as we know it must
write to no less than five different
assemblymen Ill addition to one
senator in order to express them-
selves on anytllingof concern to them
before the legislature.

Therefore, from the death grip
of old, once reached out for by the
people of Albany we can now see
just how much of the interest of
these people, the Vice-holder has
at heart.

Defends Music council

To the Editors:

. It was with mild irritation and
not a little fury that i read your
recsnt editorial on “the purpose"
of Music Council. The View that
musical offerings should be "well
rounded" in order to “cater to the
tastes of the student hotlyj” re-
flects the unfortunately widespread
willingness of our students to shut
out and reject all but familiar arid
previoust established interests.

Music Council’s programs are
designed to bring to this campus
what may best be called "serious"
mtlsn --illllSlC based on a long tra-
dilluu of forms and theories. Such
music demands an understanding on
the part of the listener or, at the
least, ll willingness to learn.

Assuming that a liberal education
ClIIIuIHIS of meeting and evaluating
new experiences, Music Council
presents programs capable ofstim-
ulatiiig all intellectual appreciation
us well as providing that i'lllllul‘
mindless enjoymoni willch we ull
find in pattern of sound.

Music Council does not suck to
impose its tastes on others, hilt it
does serve the useful function of
selecting and offering musical ox-
DCl‘iBllCeﬁ to further the cultural
education of the individual. No one
is forced to attend .or to tinfoil; lilo
dissatisfied folk or jazz inn is frui-
to find others who will sliui'o his
interest and cooperate, us frater-
nities and clubs do at other uiilvor-
allies, to bring the popular slyluslo
the students,

The iiiagliauilnous lumping tu-
geihei' of many styles of illuslc,
suggested in your editorial, would
not be likely to cater to the tastes
of anyone, for a serious interest ili
one tips of music cannot be uiiu-
quaicly served by one or own two

concerts a year-—the maximum pos—
sible under the system you propose.

Call it musical snobbery or what
you will; the fact remains that Mu-
sic Council is not attempting to do
everything, but only to fill one
specific need.ltsmambers, familiar
with the large repertory of serious
music, are seeking to present a
meaningful part of it to those who
are interested ill expanding rattler
that roasserthig their oyvp lattes.

Music Council has made a choice
and, hopefully, will continue to act
Oil that choice, sponsoringexaniples
of musical excellence for those who
welcome the opportunity to partl-
clpatc.

Irrational immaturity

_With ' the announcement of the
spring pledges for the sororities,
the pledges began a traditional per-
iod of initiation. This period is
characterized by various duties;
including lleIl Week.

Usually each girl has an unknown
hell mother who will oversee the
behavior of the "lowly" pledge dur-.
ing this time. Therefore, the degree.
of each girl’s hell duties may de-'
pend upon the whim of the hell
mother.

Each pledge is sent a letter con-
taining instructions as to the various
hell duties she is to perform.
Usually included among LIIGSeL lties
is the compilation of a pledge book
which is supposed to be signed by
each sister.

Hell Duties

A lack of signatures could result
Ill a harder penalty on Hell Night,
which is the culmination of the
pledge period. Because of these hell
duties, it is not unusual to see the
pledges running around Ill madras
shirts delightfully matched with a
plaid skirt.

One pledge from Gamma Kappa
Phi spent twenty inlnutes riding the
children's mechanical horse ill front
of Woolworth's on Central Aveilub in
the presence of two Kappa Beta
brothers.

Laundry services were required
of many pledges, usually for the
boyfriend of a godmother or one of
the hell mother’s closer friends.

Girls ilave been seen skateboard-
ing to class, carrying raw eggs
(which often break) to be sigllcd by
various people, aild bussillg boys in
tile Greek cafeteria. However, the
pledges liilal reward comes with
official sister status inhpr sorority.
