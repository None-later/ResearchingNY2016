COMITTEE HEARING: Student Tait Committee conducts its

lirst hearing on the workings of athletic tax.”

Committee Hears Athletic Director
As Student lax Hearings Continue

The Athletic Department surplus
and the relationship of the Athletic
tax to student tax were discussed
at Tuesday’s meeting of the Student
Tax Committee. The committee was
directed by a special resolution of
Central Council to discuss Athletic
Department finances.

Merlin Hathaway, Director of
Athletics and Executive secretary
of Athletic Advisory Board, ex-
plained the rule of Athletic Advisory
Board. He pointed out that the basic
duty of the Board was to determine
and supervise athletic policy and
finances, but that it only was an ad-
visory board and could only recom-
mend policy.

All decisions on policy and fl-
nances must be approved by Dr.
Thorns, Vice President of Student
Affairs.

Mr. Hathaway also explained that
budgets are drawn up by the coaches
of each team and are sent to him
for approval before they are ap-
proved by Athletic Advisory Board.

The surplus, according to Mr.
Hathaway, has been accumulated

over several years. it will he used
to cover the initial costs ofcreating
new sports when the transition is
made to the new campus. The sur-
plus, now at $100,000, will be used
to establish track, swimming, or
other sports.

The committee also sought Mr.
Hathaway’s opinion as to the pos-
sible effects of a separation of
Athletic Tax from the Student Asso-
clation Assessment on the bill in
September. Mr. Hathaway felt the
possible separation would cause no
substantial difficulties.

The committee discussed the pos—
sible separation and the increase of
student involvement in the decistons
of Athletic Department.

a stiff bow and stood there fumbling
before the Senate with his inaugural
speech.”

The book concerns the transfor-
mation of the presidency from the
early days of the republic to today's

by saturating the Washington scene

the paraphernalia of the press. To.

the natural drama ofthe President's

tlon of how may presidential powers
be restrained in this age where the
president may overcome the con-
certed opposition of other branches
of government by directly appealing
to the people.

book on the United States Senate in
the late 1800’s.
