an Academy award for her'portrayal

I of Pilar. .

The story is a product of Hern-
tngway's “political commitment"

period--the same period that gen.

erated his play, “The Filth Col-
umn." Hemingway was emotionally
involved in the Spanish Civil war,
viewing it as one of the central
conﬂicts of his time; his support
of the loyalists was one of the few
political stands he ever took.

Typical Hemingway

The story is typical Hemingway:
adventure, heroism, comradeshlp,
and love set against the background
of the war. Robert Jordan has left
his homeland to fight for the Span-
ish Loyalist cause. He joins agroup
of partisans led by the greedy bandit
Pablo; their mission is to blow up a
key supply bridge.

Falls in Love

in' the course of their efforts,
Jordan falls in love ‘with Maria, a
partisan who has been tortured and
raped by the Fascists. Comrade-
ship within the group grows as to-
gether they fight for the cause they
believe in. The story builds to a
tense climax, culminating in apolg-
nant final scene.

Sam Wood, who also directed
“Kings Row" and “Pride of the
Yankees,” draws exeellent perfor-
mances from Cooper and particu-
larly Bergman. His use of realistic
dialogue and settings create acred-
ible and exciting story that follows
the novel faithfully.

The film will be shown in Draper
349 at 7:00 and 9:15.
