that the first sure sign of spring is'th'e appearance of

everyone greets spring with renewed alacrity, we
'sports fans can only greet the Great Dane baseball
team with greatly tempered enthusiasm.

The diamondmen begin~ the year with 14 men on the
squad. Twelve men is far more adequate for a basket-
ball team that has to fill only five positions. A baseball
team should have at least three extra pitchers. a re-
serve» catcher. a- fewutility» infielders,aendra couple of
outfielders Who can fill in other spots as well. With a
few injuries, coach Burlingame willbe scanning the
bleachers for help.

We are totally sympathetic toward the baseball team

the team achieves is indeed a credit to the desire of
the diamondmen.

But over a season with twenty games crowded into
eight weeks, a team with only three reserves on hand
is in deep trouble right off the bat. Pinch-hitting will
be non-existent, and can you imagine the poor pitcher
who is being clobbered around the park, fully aware of
the fact that he is the last remaining pitcher the coach
can use? Holy earned-run-average! i

This year’s team is comprised of several talented
regulars that form a small, yet solid, nucleus for the
Danes. Pep Pizzillo, Jay Moore, Andy Christian, Bill
Ingino, and Jim Nass were important parts of last
year’s team that enjoyed a mildly successful season.
Coupled with certain standout members of last year’s
frosh team. the Danes do have a fine starting team
going for them. But that’s all.

With over thirty men out for coach Keith Munsey’s
frosh team, we do not expect this lack of depth to con-
tinue for too long. But that’s at least a season away.

This afternoon’s game with Oswego and tomorrow’s
contest with Potsdam will be a good indication of how
sorely the team’s lack of depth will hurt the Danes.
Stop by the field today or tomorrow and see if we’re
not right in being so pessimistic. We’ll be there.

Play Oswego, Potsdam at Home

by Mike Connelly

Still looking for its first win of the season, Albany State’s Great Dane baseball

team opens at home today against Oswego State (3:00 p.m.) and hosts Potsdam

State tomorrow (2:00 p.m.). Despite its current record of 0-4, Coach Burlingame’s
nine shows great promise for the coming year. The four losses came against Mont-
clair State (6-2), Maritime Academy (22-8), Farleigh Dickinson U. (5-0), and C.W.

Post, all strong teams.

The four game at was
the team’s first chance to
play on an outside diamond.
After several Scrimmages
this past week, the team
should be ready for today’s
opener.

In the C. W. Post contest Dane
pitcher Jim Nass looked impressive
in a 5 1/8 inning stint, but control
difficulties and errors put him in
trouble as Post scored two runs in
both the second ahd fourth innings.
A triple and an infield out brought
across another in the fifth. In the
sixth inning, with one out Dane

pitcher Toni Piotrowski took over,
allowing only one hit and no runs in
a strong relief performance. The
Statesman could manage only two
hits off Post’s pitcher Frank Picar-
lilo, a single by Jay Moore and a
double by Bill lngino, who was play-
ing in his first game of the season.

The Dana nine went down to defeat
in its third game at the hands of an
unbeaten Farleigh-Dickinson team
by a score of 5-0, despite a fine
route-going job by State’s’l‘om Egel-
stun.

FDU scored an unearned run in
the fourth on an error,apassed ball,
a hit batter and a sacrifice. They

scored again in the fifth on a double”

and a single and threetirnes morein
the eighth as Egelston tired, yielding
two singles, a double, ahlt batter,
and an error. '

The Great Danes were held to
three hits off two FDU pitchers,
singles by first baseman Andy
Christian, catcher Frank Kankolen-
ski, and right fielder i-lollis Toma-
selll.

Konkolenski Homers

In a marathon three hour and
twenty minute game plagued by cold
and strong winds, Maritime Acad-
emy battered the Great Danes, scor-
ing twenty-:wo runs on fifteen hits
to State’s eight runs on twelve hits.
The only bright spot of the day was

the team’s hitting as Dom Martino, J n
I

Tomaselli, Kankoienski, Moore,and
Mike Goldych each had two hits.

Catcher Kankolenski clouted a
three-run homer in the sixth inning
in addition to a single, two walks,
and a sacrifice. Pitcher Piotrowski
and third sacker Moore had the only
other extra base hits, both doubles,
and first baseman Christian con-

tributed a single to round out the
Dane’s scoring attack.

Opener at Montclolr

In the opening game of the year
against Montcialr State, the Great
Danes staged a comeback attempt
in the ninth inning with the score
6-0, but the rally fell short as the
team suffered a 6-2 loss. Montclair
managed only six hits off the serv-
ings of Egelston and Nass, but three
were for extra bases.

Coupled with six Dane miscues,
the Montclarians used themrto hand
State its first loss. The statesmen
were held to one hit by Montclair’s
Ed Jerauld until the eighth inning.
in the ninth, an error and singles by
Christian and Martino accounted
for State's lone tallies.

In the opener today, Tom Egel-
ston is the scheduled starter. A
large turnout is expected and once
again, one of State's most ardent
baseball fans, Mrs. Lester Egelston
will be on hand to throw out the
first ball.

James Farmer to Discuss”,

ClVll Rights

Freedom Council will
sponsor a lecture by James
Farmer on the Civil Rights
Revolution in America to-
morrow night at 8:00 p.m.
in Page Hall. '

Farmer is the former national
director of the Congress for Racial
Equality and a noted authority on
the Civil Rights movement.

He is internationally known as an
articulate spokesman in the struggle
for racial equality among all men.
in many of the emerging nations
throughout the world today, he is
one of the best-known Americans
and his writings and comments are
influencing men everywhere.

Led Freedom Ride

Farmer led CORE members in
the first Freedom Ride, spending
40 days in a Mississippi Jail as a
result.

In 1963, Farmer, who believes
that a leader must do more than
just plan, was arrested following a
civil rights demonstration in Louis-
iana.

He again made world headlines in
1964 when CORE and its supporters
picketed the New York World's Fair,
protesting racial discrimination and
segregation practiced by many of
the states exhibiting at the fair.

Organized CORE
Farmer helped form the first

chapter of CORE atthe University of
Chicago in 1942. These pioneers in-
tended, Farmer states, “to substi-
tute bodies for exhortations," and
to apply to the struggle for racial
equality in America the techniques

,, of non-violence and passive resist-

ance that Ghandi used so success-
fully in India.

Since that time, Farmer has been
involved directly with the social,
economic and cultural problems of
America’s Negro population.

CORE’s militancy has captured
the imagination of countless thou-
sands of young Negroes and they
have willingly participated in sit-
ins, stand-ins, sleep—ins, even jail-
ins.

Approval of the 1966-67
Student Association Budget
was the major business of
Central Council at the
meeting Thursday night.
All the budgets had pre-
viously been approved by
each commission.

The total was lower than last
year's because it is not possible
to estimate exactly how much in-
come will be obtained from student
tax. Central Council voted on each
commission budget rather than in-
dividual budgets.

The budget for the Commission for
Religious Affairs of $200 was
adopted with little discussion. The
amount approved for the Commis-
sion of Academic Affairs was $1959.

Living Allah's Commission
During the discussion on the bud-
ior Living Area Affairs Com-
mission Eieanor Dianer requested
that $150 be added for a news-
letter. She stated that a lack of
communication in the living areas
made such I newsletter necessary.
It would contain informational who
the representatives were and also
used to contact commuters. The
addition was approved.

There was also discussion on the
allocation of funds to the quads for
special events. The argument was
that it was not needed because
there had never been such an allot-
ment to the quads before. This
money, however, remained in the
budget and the total Living Area
budget came to $1832.

Discussion on the budget for Com-
munications Commission included
the fact that fewer Campus View-
points will be published next year.
They will be distributed only to
freshmen, campus leaders and
transfer students. The total ap-
proved for communications was
$43,462.

the budget for the Commission for
Community Programming, it was
