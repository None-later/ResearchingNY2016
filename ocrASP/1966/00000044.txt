Tbejollouing is.a guest editorial by Douglas Upham, represean
feline to Central Council Irom Communications Commtssron.. and

[oscpb~.lldsay. representative to Certiravaouncil- from commuters!

We congratulate Central! council for' disposing of
$103,950’I50inbudgets in-one three-hour meeting. In
the past, passage of budgets has taken several meet-
ings with much consideration devoted to the relative
merits of each request and the approximate interest or
«helm for the activity among Student Association. This
year Central Council has dispensed with such careful
but time-consuming considerations. ‘

For example, in the consideration -of the twenty
Community Programming budgets totaling $46,977.50,
which could be used as a model of efficiency, discus-
sion was limited to forty-five minutes. When it became
apparent that only Music Council’s budget ($.696.50), of
these twenty, would be discussed within this time limit,
Central Council was still able to maintain its pinnacle
of. efficiency v by passing all of the other budgets in
Community Brogramming without discussing each sep-
arately. ‘ .

Also under Community Programming Commission
is Debate Council. Its budget_line-for trips, $2400. is
not restricted. However, Biology Club must inform
Finance Committee as to how it plans to spend its
moeny for trips, $200.

Out of a total budget of $1590 for Living Area Af-
fairs Commission. $1205 was devoted to beer parties
and similar contributions to dorm living. Commuters
only received $242, although they comprise about one-
third of the total school population and are given
special emphasis in the Living Area Affairs Constitu-
.tion.

In a year in which frugality is of utmost importance
because of voluntary student tax, we feel that Central
Council ,lshould have considered each budget more
carefully to insure proper distribution to needy ac-
tivities. “W ~.

in addition to the marvelous se-

also been widely cited fas an ex-

The keynotes “individualization”

Then came the-idea to sell these
next-to-new articles of clothing at
a nominal fee and use the proceeds
for the tutees in some way.

Finally the thought that the money
should go to the children in an or-
ganized and enduring way, that is
through the Summer Community 0r-
ganization for Recreation and Ed-
ucation, SCORE '66. The Commun-
ity Organizations of the newly-

Camp's Expectations

This project for ’66 will approx-
imate, but surpass the one of sim-
ilar dimensions held last summer.
The different is that the 1965 Read-
ing Tutorial made use of the camp
site belonging to Trinity Institute
only one day a week; SCORE '66
will be located on the camp grounds
in Clarksville.

As last year, the children will
receive a minimum of 60 hours of
instruction plus the recreation time.

gram ts to insure the proper read-

 direction can overshadow
this tremendous feat.

Lately, however, Kracauer's
opinion has come under criticism
by scholars who feel that the glory
of the 'athlete is all Rolfenstahl at-
tempted to capturing.

Athletes Competing
They attribute the presence ofthe
German athletes to the fact that the
Germans, after all, were the win-
ning‘ nation that year and so would
have more athletes competing in the
final events. I ‘. ,

 These scholars also insist that
other athletes are shown in their
moments of glory, such as the
British rowing teams and the Amer-
ican divers. _

Raifenstahl employed many elab.
orate devices to make the films,
such as electric underwater boats
and slow motion techniques. Some-
one has said that there were more
cameraman than athletes at the
gamssl‘

ing skill for, the grade level of the
child, since many ofthem fall behind
in their reading as much as two
grades or more. Arithmetic will
receive the second strongest em-
phasis.

It is intended to be fully coordl-
nated with ‘a physical-social-cul-
tural skills development.

Criticizes Review

To the Editor:

in the March 29 ASP Robert Cutty
reviewed Steve Allen’s latest book,
"Letter to a Conservative.” i have
not yet read it myself, though I am
familiar with Allen's political views
and activities. The observations
which I wish to make pertain not to
the content of this publication, but
rather to Mr. Cutty's manner of
reviewing it.

(1) Though Mr. Cutty's unmiti~
gated contempt for this book was
obvious, l was unable to unearthone
clearly expressed criticism of it.
When i though i had an inkling of
what Mr. Cutty was trying to say, I
looked in vain for an example from
Allen's work to elucidate the re.-
viewer's objections. Last I begullty
of the same sort of negligence, I
submit as an example oer.Cutty's
prose the following: “While Allen
uses semantics, logic, and common
sense to support Liberal thesis, he
pioust insists that even Liberalism
is such a broad category that itmay
contain within its gates enough luna-
tlcs with which to confront the radi-
cal right and this his ownphllosophy
of Moderate Liberalism...is truly a

political Valhalla.”

(2) Rather than rational analysis
and specific criticisms of what Allen
has to say, Mr. Cutty gives us such
statements as “What absurd trash 1"
"What ridiculous rubbish!" “What
utter Iunkl" and devotes several
lines to letting us know how llitleho
thinks of the author's personality.
As he does this, Mr. Cutty indicates
that he has some special Insight into
the mind of Steve Allen. Allen, “o
are informed, “thinks he has learned
anough;" he is a “self-important
man," whose years of political ac—
tivity have been nothing but “ago
building."

' (3) in the third paragraph of his
article, Mr. Cutty complains that
Allen is “constantly shootinz “‘5
month off" on TV. Aside from the
bad taste and worst diction which n
shares with the rest of the review.
this paragraph is patently irrele-
vant. 
The above examples ought to give
the flavor of Mr. Cutty‘s discourse
to anyone who missed the orlglnul.
it seems superﬂuous to add that If
Mr. Cutty cannot express himself In
tasteful} relevant, and intelligible
English, he should leave book re-
viewing to someone who can.

the Rate University of New York,
has announced that a new program
of grants, which will significantly
oxpand‘ opportunities for research
and scholarly activity by State Uni-
versityfaculty members, is under
development. , ,

The grants will be called "Dis-
tinguished Research Fellowships"
andwill provide a semester's sal-
ary for faculty members who pro-
pose outstanding projects which can
not be adequately carried out within

   
  
 

progr_a_m formats. ' , ,
Considerationis also being given
to a-provision which would permit

combining the grant with a sabbatical .

leave, thereby providing a full year's
salary for faculty members who
meet qualification in both areas.

details of the program are being

THE AUCTION
NORTH EAST SOUTH WEST

BNT Pass Pass Pass

OPENING LEAD: 4 of mades

The auction was routine. The
opening bid was minimum, but the
North hand has all the requirements
of a good openingbid. The South hand
has stoppers intheunbld suits and 13
points, so he can bid two no trump.
N'orthn then signed off at three no
trump.

0n the opening lead, South played
the five from the dummy, and East
played the six! Of course, now
South's contract is doomed. South.
did the best he could by letting East
hold the trick, but East continued
with the spade nine.

South won, finessed the ten of
clubs, 'and ran the rest of the suit,

I ' but West won the first diamond and

led a spade to East’s king. East put
his partner back in with aheart, and
the defense took‘two more spades
to defeat the contract two tricks.
How did East know to put in the
six of spades at the first trick?
Well, first of all, he knew that South
‘ had to have a spade stopper for his
I bid. But what really toldthe tale was
a little trick known as the “Rule of
Eleven.” ; j
Here's how it works. When you
, think your partner's lead isa"fourth
'best" lead, subtract from‘eleventhe

, Vulnerablez‘ﬂdth. :pipof his car'd. That will give you r

the number of cards in the dummy
hand, your hand, and the declarer’s
hand combined that are-higher than
the card your partner has led.

But since you can see the dummy
and your own hand, you can figure
out how many cards the declarer
has that are higher than your part-
ner's lead.

In today's hand, East subtracted
the pip ofWe'st's lead - four - from
eleven and knew there were seven
cards higher than the four in either'
the dummy, his own hand, on the
declarer’s hand. He could see three
in the dummy and three in ills hand,-
so the declarer had only one spade
higher than the four.

Since he had to have a spade
stopper, South could only have the
ace. So from this analysis, East
made the killing play. Note that if
East woodenly plays third handhigh,‘
South makes his contract‘b'ecbu'se‘
he now has two spade stoppers.

(“Wha'l7,”_ said the voice). .

many of America's social elite, the
"high society" crowd, felt that jazz

it could never be heard on the ser-

Gershwin, madman that he was,
decided that someone ought to do
something about this false attitude
of America. The consequence of
tilts was “Rhapsody in Blue," “An
