"The Sound of Trumpets," a re-
cent prize-winning Italian film, will
be the main feature presented by
the International Film Group Satur-
day at 7:00 p.m. and 0:l5 p.m. in
Draper Hall 349.

The picture has been interna-
tionally acclaimed for itspathos and
insight. The story concerns a young
man who comes to Milan to take an
examination for a clerical job. He
meets a girl who is also trying for
the job, and out of the relationship
between them arises a sensitive and
moving story.

The film’s approach is that of
Neorealism, an Italian cinema
movement that grew up shortly after
World War Ii. Neolreaiism empho-
sizes the actual--the use 0! real
settings, non-professional actors
for most of the roles, and natural-
istic dialogue and'piot.

 

Dispense with Artificiolity

The idea is todispense with studio
artificiality, to let the camera act
as an unseen observer of the daily
life of ordinary people.

“The Sound of Trumpets" is an
excellent example of
technique. The main characters are

, . symbolic Victories
Sadly noting that "the victories

I achieved by the civil rights move-

ment have so far been symbolic and
dramatic, Farmer looked-forward
to the day when these would be-con-
verted to tangible assets for the
Negro people: education, jobs, op-
portunity, equality.

Farmer brought out three reasons

for the emergence of the Civil Rights _

Movement. First he cited that Ne-
groes fought along with others to
defeat the "master race" theory in
WW II, and wondered about the
“master race” situation‘back home.
Second is the increasing education
given to all American youth, in-
cluding Negroes, and third a ten-
dency to stop repudiatingthelr Afri-
can heritage as the African Nations
emerge and join the community of
respectable nations.

Summer Trouble
"Frankly, I am worried about
this summer." With this statement
Farmer evoked vivid memories of
Harlem, Watts and Rochester, and
explained his reasons for concern.
He cited figures that indicated in-

creasing segregation in the North, '

and increasing financial problems
for the Negro. But he added: “I
do not predict riots, ldeplore them.”
He stated the need to move fast
and that contrary to belief, most
Negroes are not non-violent. '

Farmer stated his opinion that
the civil rights movement is now
entering a new phase, a phase less
dramatic than the first, concerned
with reaching the ghetto commun-

non-actors and they blend in per-
fectly with the grimy streets and
chilly offices that are their natural
surroundings.

I Thcme

The theme is the way that modern
mechanized civilization forces men
into inhuman shapes. The minor
characters -- office workers, la.-
borers, street urchins -- are all
realized as individuals, and Oimi
uses them skillfully to illustrate
the tragic implications ofhistheme.

According to the report issued
