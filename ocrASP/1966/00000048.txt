With the; increasing disappearance of
traditions On campus, one tradition con-
tinues to remain: registration and all the

confusion it entails.

For the past few years, the registrar
has made the systemof registeringmore
interesting for the student by trying out

new methods each semester. The pur-
pose of each system is to try to alleviate
some of the chaos of the registration

period.

The procedure, for this semester is L

unique in'that it will promote more con-
fusion by having two weeks of advise-

ment before cards can be

acquisition of these men will
greatly enhance the prestige and repu-
tation of the University and its various
schools. It is evidence of the tremen-
dous growth that the University is un-
dergoing and the belief that these new
people have in ,the University by leaving
their positions to join our faculty.
Their presence at the University will
' mean more courses of greater quality
for the students. .
However, as expressed by Dr. James
ewis, Assistant to the President, at
the president’s pressconference Mon-
day, his too bad that few students real—
ize how distinguished these men are.

The Administration has indicated that
nothing can be done about the situation
since the only area that could be used

not allow the area to be used.

It is hoped that by next year with

not use their cars as frequently. Also,

Social, Political llelormlleedetl

Io lleleal Viet Cong Guerillas

by D. Gordon Uphom

“South Vietnam is able to govern
itself as well as many of the emer-
ging nations of Africa," according
to General Maxwell D. Taylor. It
is hard for anyone to disagree with
this statement.

As with many emerging nations,
South Vietnam has not had any de-
gree of native political heritage.
When the French withdrew in 1954,
there was no group with political
experience which was willing and
able to govern the country. There
was no real alternative to the rule
of a dictator.

The successive military regimes
which have held power since the
overthrow of President Diem have
illustrated the problems faced by
many new governments. Military
regimes tend to be conservative in
their political views, usually caus-
ing no change in the social struc-
ture of the country.

The situation in South Vietnam
is worsened by the desire of the
government to concentrate on win-
ning the war against Viet Cong.
As in the United States, concentra-
tion on military goals has ‘caused
the government to devote less at-
tention to social problems.

Social Change Necessary

However, for the government of
South Vietnam to defeat the gueril-
has, it must emphasize political
and social grievances, the govern-
ment must undercut these griev-
ances with its own reforms.

In the areas under the control of
the government, the government
must offer some program of land
reform which gives land to the
peasants. Also, efforts must be
made to reduce the ﬂagrant cor-
ruption which exists in the Saigon
regime.

The above reforms are difficult
under peaceful conditions, but the
government has to try to institute
them during the present conflict if
it expects to win the population.

Political Reforms
It Is also obvious that the govern-
ment must make politlcpl reforms.
The various factions within the coun-
try must have their political desires
satisfied. In the case of South Viet-

nam, there will probably have to be
some form of representative gov-
ernment. ’

In many emerging countries, a
strong dictator is able to satisfy
the political desires of the various
factions. In Egypt, President Nas-
ser has been able to stay in power
by satisfying the various groups.

President Sukarno in Indonesia
was able to retain power for a long
time through a combination of pol-
itics and a personalcharisma. How-
ever, South Vietnam's President
Diem had little popular appeal or
ability to satisfy the various fac-
lions.

It is doubtful that any one person
will be able to become a strong
leader in South Vietnam, since there
exists no leader with the respect of
all groups.

Viet Government

The future government of South
Vietnam will have to permit repre-
sentation of the various factions if
it is to succeed. it does not need to
be as democratic as most of the
governments of the West,butit must
satisfy the demands of the religious
groups, the social classes, and mili-
tary.

It is important from apsychologi-
cal viewpoint that the people of the
country believe that the government
is working for their interests. A
representative government willholp
to create this belief.

A representative government also
allows the population to express
dissatisfaction with the government
through acceptable, peaceful means.

One of the problems of the Diem
regime was that the opposition had
no recourse but to fight against the
government by allying with the Viet
Cong. Any new government must
allow dissension without the repres-
sion practiced by the Diem regime.

The Honolulu Conference, In which
General Ky promised to carry out
various social and political reforms,
must be the blueprint for future ac-
tion in South Vietnam.

These reforms are difficult to
carry out in time of conflict, but
there is no alternative. The conflict
in South Vietnam cannot be won
solely by military measures. With-
out social and political reforms
‘there can be no victory in South
Vietnam,

l COMMUNICA TIONSl

Discussion Adequate

To the Editor:

In reference to the editorial of
Mr. Uphnm and Mr. Mahay, some
considerations might be made.

Each separate budget was sub-
mittod by an organization, reviewed
by the appropriate Board and Corn-
mlsslon, and sent to the Budget
Committee. If the question lies with
the procedure, this procedure could
have been questioned when It was
presented. Since it was passed as
the official procedure for the treat-
ment of the various budget requests,
the Council was obviously agree-
able.

Several copies of the various bud-
gels were presented to the Commis-
sions and to tho Budsot Committee
and hearings were held. If there
wars questions, they too could have
been cmisldereu at that'timo.

It is not necessary for the entire
Contra] Council to dissecienchbiul-
got. If the money is needed or
deemed needed by an organization,
screening at the'Boar'd, Commis-
sion, and Budget Committee level,
plus filial npprovai of the Council,
is actually Screening of a greater
degree than was accomplished by
the old method. In addition, the
screening is now in the hands of
those people best qualified to aval-
uate the budgets.

Indeed, the coming your might
be one of frugality, but the past
year and a half has been a time of
careful,considaration of all phases
of government. In the forming of
the new government, "level ofbnsic
concern" was keynote. Are we to
assume now that In the operation of
the new government that these words
are nicoties to be ignored?

to nude M

by Gary Koplon

 

Of tha'recent 1966 film releases,
the motion picture that definitely

1' - came gout at the ‘~wrong time is

a

,

d .
'1';

 

 

“The Oscar,” a film which atteinpts
to torpedo the myth that all that
goes on behind the Academy Award

- nominations is fair and commend-

able. “The Oscar," in short, is the
story of the quick rise and fall of
lactor Frank Fans, at nogoodnik who
-uses both. friends and enemies as
doormats in order to attain power
andsuccess in the motion picture
industry.

On another level, the film is an
over-exaggerated, inflated account
of the people who are a part of this
industry-the phony actors and ac-
tresses; the conniving, sometimes
blackmaillng agents; and their weak-
mlnded, unethical associates.

Many Stars
Some of the film's many stars are
Stephen Boyd, Elke Sommer, Tony
Bennett, Milton Berle, Eleanor Par-
ker. and Jill St. John. “Cameo
roles” are filled by such people as

' Edith Head, Bob Hope, Frank Sina-

tra, and the late liedda Hopper.
,As one can see, “The Oscar"
is one huge panorama of stars and
conglomeration of events that are
unsuccessfully pushed into a film
length of approximately twoliours.
However, the biggest flaw of the
film is its ridiculous, crude and
trite dialogue which destroys any
attempts by the actors and actresses
to do anything effective with their
roles. The characterizations, as a
result, are shallow and superficial.
The stars become human faucets
spouting forth a dialogue that con—
sists of nothing less than banal,
over-worked cliches.

Poor Stcphcn
In this case, the actor I feltsori'y
for the most was Stephen Boyd, who
plays the part of the boisterous
Frank Fans. This unfortunate man,
who is in no uncertain terms a good

il-lv?

  

color, becomes unmerclfully'stm!
and hampered by his script. Mr.
Boyd is given the burdensome task
of being In practically every single
scene offhe picture, all the time
acting like the cad, heel, or what-
evs'r you call him whom hols forced
to constantly depict.

Because he? role also lacksdspth,
Elke Sommor becomes awoman who
appears irrational and capricious.
The audience, inmy opinion, is
never given a reasonable explana-
tion for her chameleonlike actions.

 

 

 

Talent in Son Francisco

The "actor" whom Ifeltno mercy
for at all was Tony Bennett, who in
his acting debut portrays Frank
Fane's weak-minded, hip-talking
friend called Hyrnie Kelly, a man
who later in the film rebels against
his plight as Fane’s cohort. The
only explanation for Mr. Bennett's
terrible characterization, it seems,
is that he not only left his heart in
San Francisco, but his acting ability
as well.

Those actors and actresses who
make up for this deficiency by giving
half-way decent performances are
Milton Berle, Edie Adams, Ernest
Borgnine, and Eleanor Parker.

Typical Ordinary

Director Russell Rouse could have
made a classic motion picture, but
instead he chose his picture to be-
come nothing more than one of
those typical Hollywood ordinaries-
-basically on accountofthe already-
mentioned absurd dialogue.

“The Oscar” is, by all means, a
must for those movie-goers who
are curious to see how faulty dia-
logue and miscastlng ofactor's (such
as Mr. Bennett) can utterly ruin a
motion picture.

GOLDEN EYE

“The Art of the Guitar" is the
topic of the Golden Eye to be pre-
sented tonight. Participants in the
program will he Ken Murdick, An-
drew Binder, William Smilh and
Richard Schaefer.

by LorryluEp I ‘ n ‘
One of the few enjoyable moments
at the Oscar show'pressnted last
Monday night occurred'whsn Julie
(Sugar Lips) Andrewstdld' not win

the Academy Award for bestsctress. -

If ever the award is given for best
singsrln a children’s movie,*Miss
Andrews is sure to be deserving.

The most startling (from thepoint
of View of quality) results were
these: -

Best Picture-The “Sound of Mn-
sic” (starring Miss Andrew and
the Nazis). Transplanted from her
equally sophisticated role as chic
Mary Poppins, Miss Andrews
romped through the Alpines. Surely
a movie such as this contains the
strength of “Dr. Zhivago" or the
off-beat comic mastery of “A Thou-
sand Clowns.” With thinking like
this, it is not above the Oscar
people to bestow honors on Annette
next year.

Bast Acton-Rod Steigei' gave one
of the finest performances ever of
an actor when he tore the insides
of the audience out in his role in
“The Pawnbroker." Oscar_ Werner
made everyone aware, as he had be-
come, of how precarious the world
is in “Ship of Fools." Lee Marvin
was funny in an essentially minor
role in "Cat Ballou." Winner: Lee
Marvin.

Best DirectoruAnoiher accolade
that "Sound of Music" equally de-
served along with best picture was
best director (Robert Wise). John
Schlesinger's ability to get inside
Julie Christie went unrewardsd;
William Wyler"s most fantastic
achievement to date, forcing Sa-
mantha Eggar to act, went unnoticed.

It is beyond me why the industry r
insists that It is not quality that ,
brings an award but merely being ‘
sick (as was Elizabeth Taylor), or 
appearing to be wronged (the An- .
drews-Hepburn-Doolittle Affair) at. '
the right moment. " '
