V‘Withgonly ’=a week and a hall’s notice. last year’s
' first AMIA track meet attracted sixty-two entrants
' “ representing-“sixgteams. The meet was-witnessed by a
urge crowd of enthusiastic spectators who supplied

plenty of’encouragement for the participants.

7 z-lThe' times and distances were truly remarkable con-
sidering the short notice of the meet and the condition
of the field. As you all know. one way or another, Vets
Field is better suited for woodchuck hunting than it is
for ai track meet. The loo-yard dash was won in a fine
10.5 and the 220-1n a snappy 22.9 The mile was cap-
tured in‘ a 4:50 (later improved to a 4:32 in the second
meet) and the half-mile in 2:05. And the other statistics
were equally as good.

One can only imagine what the results might have
been had the runners had ample time to condition them-
selves for the meet and had they run on a cinder track.

' For weeks now many. of the runners have been prac-
ticing on their own for this meet. With all the frater—
nities expected to enter teams and several independent
squads as well, we can only feel highly optimistic
about the meet.

It is our sincere desire that Albany develop a track
team in the immediate future. Track is the greatest of
‘all individual sports, and all of you can remember the
spirit and enthusiasm created by track meets in your
high school days. Also, varsity cross-country coach
R. Keith Munsey, who we are sure would pilot such a
team, would have the additional recruit attraction of a
track team to interest prospective runners.

Once again we are appealingvto the student body for
support of this program. This track meet presents the
unique situation of affording sports fans the opportunity
to take a short, yet positive. step toward theformation
of a much-needed and desired new team. '

If you don't want to participate and are still inter-
ested in showing your support of such aprogram, attend
the meet, cheer the runners, tell athletic director Mer-
lin Hathaway (who will most assuredly be there _-—-
measuring the turnout, spirit, talent, etc. - and weighing
the merits and possibilities of a Dane track team) that
you are in favor of starting a track team.

The meet will start at 2:00 p.m. By 5:00 p.m. the
fate of an Albany track team will have been decided.
What's your decision?

Martino, and Hollis Tomaselli each
had one apiece.

In the Potsdam game, the North-

three singles. A perfect throw to
the plate by Moore cut off another
Potsdam run.

Potsdam scored the winning run
in the sixth on an infield hit and a
long triple. Pitcher Piotrowakl was
the batting hero for the Danes with
two singles and the triple. Despite
several good scoring chances, the
Statesman could not put across the
tying run, as Staab scattered their
nine hits.

Oswego Spells Opener

In the home opener on Friday,
Oswego handed the Danes their fifth
straight defeat. The Statesmen led
2-1 after three innings as Pizillo
sln'gled, stole second,and went home
on Christian’s single.

Ingino walked and left-fielder
Martino singled Christian home. In
the second, Pizillo made a diving

tab of a grounder at second to save

at least one run.

The Statesman's lead did not hold
up however, as Oswego came right
back in the fourth with three runs,
and two more in the sixth, to take a
6-2 lead.

The Danesmen rallied in the ninth

.to score a run on singles by Ingino,

Martino, Kankolenskl and Cianfrinl,
but it was not enough to offset the
three run lead.

In the last meeting of

.Council voted to rescind

the act of the. rider
passed at the April 14'
meeting concerning final;

.approval of Music COuii-‘

011’ s budget.

The ridef was passed in response
to student criticism over Music
Council's policy of presenting only
classical music. .

Discussion arose over Line 1 of

‘ Music Council’s constitution which

states that Music Council will only
present music of the highest caliber

‘ to the University.

The rider would have held up any
spending or contracting of money to
Music Council until Central Council
had approved a breakdown of the
proposed artists.

Special Events

Following a discussion centering
around the fact that money has al-
ready been appropriated to Special
Events Board for popular concerts
next year, the rider was rescinded
in 21-0-3 vote. It was also pointed
out that it isn't Central Council’s
place to act ascensor to Music
Council.

Stoll near the end of the meeting
proposed to appropriate $700 from
