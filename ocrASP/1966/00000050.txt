en the year began last September.
many .people were dubious about the
new government. Its uniqueness festered
many fears that it would not work.

Central Council and its various com-
ponent parts entered the year‘ with the
legacy of the quoremless Senatewhich.
was haunting the history of-‘student gov--
ernment atrthe University for the past
severai‘years. ‘

HoweVer. these uncertainties were
soon dispelled as Central Council went
to work. It faced many crises during
the year (Torch controversy. student
tax problem, MYSKANIA elections. etc.)
and handled each one adeptly.

.The lesser and routine work of gov-
ernment were also handled efficiently
without loss of interest by its members
(there was always a quorem) and the
student body. .‘

The'crowning achievement of the year
was when they were able to convince
86% of the student body to pay student
tax for this semester.

We would like to congratulate Central
Council and its commissions on a year
well-done.

We feel that much of the credit for
the success of the new government can
be attributed to the effective leadership

of Central Council.

When he entered office, he faced the
problem that student government had
lost much of its effectiveness and pres—

‘tige on campus. It had become subject

to mockery by many students.

Now that his term of office has e‘ndedp‘
student government has regained its
prominence: we“ feel that"this change

 can be attributed in large part to the

dynamic leadership of its. president dur-
ing the year.

He added new vigor to student g0vern-
ment andﬁthough we have occasionally"
disagreed with his idealism, new ideas
about government.

He was the perfect man to head the
new government and it will be difficult
to find someone to fill his shoes.

theistate-Universit-y -

Studies Program at the University of"Wurzbur‘g.

The program is designed
for. upper classmen and
graduate students in the
teaching and liberal arts
fields. - a

it is intended to fit into the general

scheme of oversees study currently
being developed under the auspices

‘ of the sure University’s Center for

international Education and World
Affairs at Planting Fields, Oyster
Day, Long Island.

Thirty Students Admitted
A total of approximately thirty
specially qualified students will be
admitted. It is expected that they
will come from Albany and Oneonta,
but applications from other branches
of, the State University are wel-

‘ corned. '

The participants will be assisted
by two resident faculty directors
throughout the year, with the sup-
plementary services of a third
American professor during the
orientation period in Wurzburg.
Housing and meals will be with
German families or in-dormitories
with Germah students. V

Eligibility

The program is open to students
of greater academic potential be-
cause of the difficulties of studying
in a foreign environment. However,
the means of selection will be kept
relatively ﬂexible, and various fac-
tors will be considered in balance.

Provisional acceptance will de-
pend upon the following criteria:
foreign language aptitude test, a
review of the‘ student's high school
and college academic record, three
letters of recommendation, a per-
sonal interview by the director,
consultation with the student's pre-
sent curricular adviser and a bio-
graphical sketch.

Costs

The ultimate cost of the program
should be no greater than the ex-
pense of attending a State Univer-
sity unit for the equivalent period
of time.

Freshmen Activities
Planned hv llliicers

Tentative plans for freshman
class activities were made at an
executive meeting of the class offi-
cers April 13. Among these are plans
for participation in State Fair.

The class will sponsor a pizza
booth in cooperation with the Class
of ’68, and will also present a skit.

Tentative plans have been made
for a freshman-sophomore beer
party for the Saturday night of the
fair. The two classes will also spon-
sor a faculty tea May 16.

Fall acti'vitles scheduled include
a picnic and beer party onOctober
28; and a sophomore weekend which
will be held April 7-9.

Anyone interested in working on
these projects would be greatly
appreciated and should contact a
class officer.

' Sociology Club

Formed on Campus

Logos Popularii, a newly-formed
organization on campus intended to
provide a context within which people
interested can operate, will sponsor
a panel discussion on the recent
Eastern Sooiological Association
Conference which will be held
Thursday, April 28 at 7:30 pm.
at the Central Arms Tavern.

The club is planning other projects
such as speakers on a variety of

-‘l‘h‘e hoidéup play is a very handy

In today's hand, South won the
openini'l'e’n'd with the ace, led a
diamond tOLthe dummy, and finessed
the jack of spades. West grabbed
the kind of spades, and since his
partner had played a, high heart on
the first trick, he continued with
the jack of hearts.

Now, East was. smart. Holding
three diamonds, he figured thatdia-
monds would run and that his side
hadbetter get their tricks while they
could. Soho overtook his partner's
heart and led the queen of clubs.

Ofxcourse, the defense now col-
lected two club tricks in addition to
the heart and the spade. Down one.
“Too bad, partner,” said South,
“Everything was wrong.” North told
him that he should have made it

Watch what happens if South lets

Th‘e’déféliée is helpless. 'East can
never gain the lead to give his side

If West continues hearts, the ace
will win the second trick and now
when the spade finesse loses, West
can not make a, good lead. South can
now throw two clubs on the longdia-

Yes, fans, South can make an

contract was four spades, not six.

OPENING LEAD: Q of Hearts

- Malcolm X ,

When asked what he thought the
impact of such men as Malcolm X
was, Farmer thought it was a "tre-
mendous impact," and believed that
Mr. X was “moving towards the
mainstream of the Civil Rights
Movement at the time of his un-
timely death.” '

Farmer saw the problems of the

future as extensions of those that
exist today. “More public works,
more professional and semi-pro-
fessional jobs can be created and
must be. .

They represent the flags of our

taining 50 stars.

America.

2. The Pilgrims of the Mayﬂower
took the Cross of St. George and
superimposed it on the flag of St.
Andrew and created the “Kings
Colors.”

3. In 1707 the “Kings Colors”
were placed on a field of red, and
this was called the “British Red
Ensign" or the “Cromwell Flag.”

Anyone who feels that they fulfill _

these requirements should contact
Martin Schwartz at 462-5206 or
