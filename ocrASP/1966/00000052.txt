'- ' Reaction ﬁlo. the‘ v 1966
‘Torah has been quiet as
compare
By that; rupted last year, in
reaction towthe yearbook.
‘ There were. many strong and vs. -
'ied opinionsiarnong those students
who were» asked about this year's
yearbook. Most senior‘s, interviewed
by the ASP. were proud of the book.
.‘One senior commented that
“overall, itii's oneof-the better
yearbooks produced by the Univer-

sity'in the last few years. "But,"
she‘ added, “it' does not show the
careful preparation and craftsmen-
ship evidenced by the 1965 Torch.
Its main fault is a lack of continuity."

Another senior expressed the
same criticism, “last year's book
was better, there was more life.
'This year's needed a little more
narrative between pictures to tie
the yearbook together."

 

Too Formal

This senior also felt'that the
1966 Torch’is much too formal.
There were too many formal pic-
tures of boards and commissions,
and not enough coverage of infor-
mal student activities, such as
sings."

One senior remarked “i didn't
think the book was bad at all, ex-
cept_ for‘ some misspellings. l’m
proud of it as my senior yearbook.”

A sophomore commented that
"this year’s Torch-was much more
tasteful than last year’s. it was a
much better representation of the
University than last year’s.

"However, the misspelling of
names was really bad, because the
yearbook is supposed to be arecord
of what you’ve done."

Excellent Portrayal
"The Torch is an excellent por-
trayal of University life here at
Albany,” said a graduate student.
“It is a conservative yearbook for
a conservative campus."

Another senior Said “it was a
letdown. It went from one extreme
to the other. it was faculty oriented
this year. There was not enough
candid shots. There was definitely
too much on the Greeks and the new
campus. There was no theme."

Awards Announced

The Annual Chemistry Evening
of the Department of Chemistry
at the University was held in Bru-

-' Many stunt. remarked  ‘
there was more coverage ofrOreeh
activities than ‘ in‘ the 1965 Torch;
Whether or not they considered this
desirable depended on whether or
not they were Greeks. _ r
Regarding the pictures of the new
campus, one. outspokeniunior stated
"‘it was terrible. It was an abortion.

' “With 4,000 undergraduates, it
might be worthwhile to have a few
of them in the candid shots. Most
people look and do different things.
Most cranes look and act alike."

Photography Beautiful

A freshman expressedanopposite -
opinion. ."The photography Was x
beautiful. The pictures of the new
campus reflected the University. As
for last year's book with all those
"candid shots,” if you want some-
thing like “Playboy,” you could go

Mrs. Cook hoped that students not
become alarmed. She said that all
cards will not be drawn within the
first few days so there should be no
rush. She does not anticipate a long
line since students have classes to
attend.

"It was notentirely my decision,"
asserted Mrs. Cook. If this proced-
ure of beginning class card pulling
after 1,700 students have completed
advisement does not work out, it
will be revised in future semesters.

Although this column is usually
devdted to campus events, the in-
terests of most college students
extend beyond the realm of the
University. For this reason, this
week’s column goes off campus to
.an item that might be of interest
to the many students who are resi-
dents of New York City.

Last weekend, i witnessed the
stabbing of a teen-age boy by a
would-be thief in New York’s up-
per west side. I was amazed at the
action, or lack of it, by New York's
police force.

New York has a special phone
number for emergency police serv-
ice. One is repeatedly told that by
dialing this number, or by dialing
the operator and asking for the
police, fast service is assured.

After dialing this number three
times and receiving no answer, and
after calling the operator three
times with the same results, 1 was
finally able to get through to the
station.

It took the police nineteen min-
utes, from the time they were called,
to arrive on the scene, and another.

five minutes to get the victim into
an ambulance. By this time, the
boyd had lost an estimated two to
three pints oi.blood.

Aside from the emergency med-
ical needs of the boy, the incident
directly involved a Negro and a
Puerto Rican, definitely explosive
elements in an area located one
block from the Harlem border.

Any large city depends upon its
police force for protective, pre-
ventive, and emergency service
when it is needed. What kind of
protection is there when on this
corner, as on others, attacks occur
on the average of once a month?

What kind of emergency aid is
there when it takes policemen
twenty-five minutes to get to the
scene of a crime and load the vic-
tim into an ambulance?

Perhaps this kind of incident is
a hang-over from the Wagner reign,
or perhaps it isjustacharacteristlc
of any urban government.

in any case, I hope that the city's
new administration can change the
pattern of inefficiency, and provide
some degree of security for the
city's seven million residents.

PE Department -

Offers New Courses

A course in recreation leadership
will be offered to undergraduate men
and women next fall. The course,
P.E. 103, is designed to prepare
students for leadership in extra-
curricular activities of schools and
in community recreational activi-
ties. .

Topics included are the worthy
use of leisure; the nature and value
of play; recreation organizations
and activities; program planning;
leadership for clubs, playgrounds
and community centers; and the
organization of competitive activi-
ties.

The course will be an elective
and will be taught by the staff of
the Department of Physical Educa-
tion and Safety Education. '

Another new course being offered
is for potential driver and safety
educators. This course has been
resumed on a full time basis for
the fall semester because of two
factors: the interest expressed by
school administrators to have teach-
ers who ,are approved to teach
driver and traffic safety education
in addition to their major secondary
certification area.
