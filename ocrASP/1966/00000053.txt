group living at Camp Dippikill planned by Stu Salomon.

SCOPE to Sponsor
Golden Eye Program

The Golden Eye, a cotiee house
for students and faculty will be the
scene tonight ior a panel discussion
on Civil Rights. Sponsored by the
University chapter of the Summer
Community Planning Organization
and Political Education Project
(SCOPE), the program will be high-
lighted by three faculty speakers.

“in White America” will be in-
terpreted from an historian’s ap-
proach by Dr. Catherine Newbold,
who will discuss the history of the
Negro Rights Movement in North
America.

Dr. Henry Minion oi the psychol-
ogy department will speak on the
psychological aspects oi segrega-
tion, while Dr. William Rowley will
comment on the rights inevement
and its progress in Albany.

Student moderator for the evening
is Ken Fuchsman. Open comments,
questions, and general discussion
will conclude the program.

SCOPE Prolacta

in conjunction with the Golden
Eye, SCOPE is sponsoring the dis-
cussion in an attempt to focus at-
tention 'on the civil rights movement
and publicize its own projects for
the coming summer.

Created to train and send volun-
teers to aid in voter registration and
community organization in the Deep
South. SCOPE members will soon

begin a drive to solicit contributions

for its summer plan's.

Last year two students were sent
from the University to Allendale,
North Carolina. They aided in reg-
istering voters there, and also par-
ticipated in political projects.

Through this project and similar
ones, Negro registration in the South
has increased significantly. This
year’s plans sending representa-
tives to Southern counties, with an
emphasis on tasks concerning edu-
cation and political organization.

University Support Solicitod

SCOPE representatives are sup-
ported by contributions irom the
students, faculty, community, and
neighboring colleges. Last year’s
drive netted $400, with 'a compara-
tively small sum coming irom State
students.

Through their projected financial
campaign, SCOPE members this
year hope to increase the support
given by the University by appealing
to the hononaries, Greek organiza-
tions, and directly to the students.

Volunteers Needed
Applicants for the summer pro-
ject are now belngsought.lnierested
students are requested to contact
Toby. Walkoff (472-6783) or Marcy
Posner (472-6431) in Alden Hall.

Constantine Pleasing, Monotunuus,
Ian & Sylvia’s itlhuni ‘lnviguraiing’

by Roger Bﬂvkin

Several weeks ago Rob Constan-
tine gave a performance in Page
Hall. Although iolk singing is not
us popular as it used to be on col-
lege campuses, he still drew a
fairly large crowd, most of whom
i am sure were satisfied. I found
him very enjoyable.

However, i felt that his concert
was too long and had too many of
the same type of songs. lie has an
excellent voice, but he did not have
enough variety in his agenda. As
a result, 1 became tired of hear-
ing the same thing.

There were a few humorous tunes
and two last ones. The others were
slow. With an excellent Villt‘t- and

Last iail i saw ion ‘t Sylvia in
concert. 1 was only' slightly im-
pressed. ﬂoyvever, i received one
oi their albums last wait. Now i
am oi quite a diluent opinion.
it seems many at their songs are

about Canada, whether it be the cold
or the' leading people. ’

Their music is a cross between
country and western and folk, some-
times called Western folk. Most oi
their melodies are very rhythmic,
often relating the tale of a person
who is down and out.

Although Ian writes most oi the
material, what is probably the most
popular song from the album was
written by Gordon Lighifooi. As a
matter oi fact, this tune is the title
of the album, “Early Morning Rain."
Ian and Sylvia produce an invigor-
ating effect with their harmony and

timing.

Accompanying the nearly thirty
students, who ranged from fresh-
men to graduates, were faculty
members Dr. Adams (and family),
Dr. Rosenbach, and Mr. Abrams.

Psychological Communication

Comments by Dr. Rosenbach on

on the agenda ior Friday evening.
An eduoational psychologist,Rosen-
bach approached the problems oi

communication and understanding ‘

from a psychological viewpoint on
varying levels, both among groups
and between individuals. , v

Today’s Enlnr
Celebrates IO

by Sara Kl‘tts’ley

David Borofi, in an article on
Albany State appearing in the "Sat-
urday Review” in 1961, stated that
while Albany’s students are “better
prepared, in a systematic way,”
they are “terribly uncreative. You
have to tell them exactly what to
do I!

It was in reaction to this, and
other comments on the intellectual
level oi the State students, that
“suppression” was begun by Bob
Baker and Andrew Nlederman. This
week marks the publication ’oi the
hundredth issue oi "suppression"
since its advent in the second so-
mester oi the 1961-62 academit
your.

Financial ' " ,. ‘

“suppression,” presently edited
by William Leue, is financially in-
dependent oi the Student Associa-
tion, relying on student contribu-
tions for its continuation. It is pub-
lished by a small group oi students
but will accept any suitable ma-
terial from other students.

in its first year the staif of
"suppression" paid a vtsitto Mayor
Corning in order to complain about
the state oi Albany's streets. How-
ever, this caused some dissension
over whether the students had been
out of place and MYSKANIA went to
apologize.

Leue stated that as far as quantity
of material is concerned the first
two years of publication were the
most prolific, especially during the
second year with‘ Fred Thumhart
and Bob Judd as co-edttors.

Liberal Policy
“suppression’s” policy has never
been set in a formal (rmnework, but

Current Role

A trend toward criticism, both
literary and political, became ap-
parent under the editorshlps of Bill
Gross and Stuart Salomon.

in an informal interview Editor
Laue commented on the role cur-
rently played on campus by “sup-
pression.” lie feels that because of
its previous years views "sup-
pression" has often been accepted as
part oi the "loyal opposition."

He feels there is often hostility
to “suppression.” However, this has
abated in feeling from earlier years.
