Butiwhatgiaboutainrrcompetitive golf? cheaters; not

as unthinkable as'it seems.

, .

' Bill Kane, who has been Albany’s number, one man

over the team’s first three matches, is the squad’s
self-proclaimed “ExpertCheater.” He claims this
art takes not only skill and technique, but genius as -
well.

When cheating in competitive golf, the object is to

win at all costs. be it through “aiding” your own game
:or destroying your opponent’s. Here are some of Bill’s
favorite employments: '

At the start of a match, explain to your opponent that

you will give. him two strokes handicap if he will give
you two “friks.” If he has never heard of this deal be-
fore and accepts your offer, the match is as good as
over. After your opponent has hit his tee shot and is

about to hit his second shot, you call out, at the top

of his backswing, “FRlKl " This will undoubtedly ruin
his shot. Now you politely remindhim thatyou still have
one left, to be used at your discretion. Get the picture?

Always wear pants with a hole in one pocket to golf

matches. Many a stroke has been saved by the fortunate
golfer who, after‘searching the woods for several min-
utes for, a lost ball, suddenly discovers it right at his
feet.

But always be friendly to your opponent--comment on

his fine form. For instance, tell him how pretty and
effective that delay at the top of his backswing is. After
all, you noticed it. why shouldn’t he? And don’t let him
feel bad about poor shots. In fact, always‘tell him
“nice shot” after a shanked wedge and "that’s your
best drive of the day" on one that barely reaches the
ladie’s tee. 

But cheating does have its embarrassing moments.

One time Bill had just‘finished marking his ball on the
green and was waiting for another player to putt. After
the putt. Bill wanted to make sure of his line, so he
' remarked the ball, somewhat closer to the hole.

After the next player potted, Bill did the same thing.

behavior, finally spoke up: “Mark it once more Bill and

I trust all of you realize that this article was pure
jest. All but the latest incident, that is. But accept this
word of warning: don’t accept any “friks” from stran-
gers, and stick to miniature golf — it’s a lot less frus-

trating - believe me.

Danes Bow to Plattsburgh

The Albany State Great Dane ten-
nis team dropped its second match
in three outings when they dropped
a match against Plattsburgh State,
6-3, last Saturday at the New Cam-
pus tennis courts.

The key to Plattsburgh's triumph
was in their defeating State in five
of the six singles matches. Tom
Slocum was the lone Dane victor in
singles play as he edged Mike lior-
ling, 12-10, 12-10, in a fiercely
contested match.

Zacharias Beaten
Ken Zacharias, again playing
number one man, was defeated by
Don McManus, 6-3, 6-0, and third
man Tom Walencik lost to the visi-
tors Ray Asner, 6-1, 0-1. Number

five man Bob Dobrusin and sixth
man Tony Glaser also dropped their
matches to the visiting Cardinals.

'i'ne doubles matches saw the not-

men take two of the three contests.

' Zacharias-Slocum defeated McMan-
ills-Asher 6-4, 6-3, and Dobrusln-
Glaser topped Westiall-Garrow, ti-
3, 6-4. “crane-Spring accounted for
Plattsburgh’s only doubles victory
on a windy day by heating Walenclk-
Nicosia 0-0, 8-3.

The netmen, 1-2 on the season,

face RPl today in an away match.

The fresh tennis team, coached
by Joe Garcia, has started its 1966
season by winning its first two
matches, 5-4, over Hudson Valley

. Community College, and a 9-Oshut-
out over Cobleskiil. Ron McDermott
and Martin Bergen playing numbers
one and two men respectively paced
the yearlings in both matches.

Inauguration Reveals
New Central Council

by Debby Friedman

Richard The mp o n.
president of Central Coun—
cil 1965-1966. began the
second inauguration cere—
mony of Central Council
last Sunday with the remark
that it was an event which
many people thought would
not occur.

“Speaking in ‘Bruhacher bower
Lounge, Thompson summed up the
direction that the new government
is heading, the problems of the past
year, and areas of future concern
to Central Council, before the re-
sults of the elections wororevealed.

Challenges

lie continued that, “any new gov-
ernment structure causes ('oilli'u—
versy, but it also offers a challenge
and a great feeling of satisfaction
when it manages to survin its first
year of existence. During the past
year we suffered growing pains,
these pains will continue into the
near future."

But, Thompson added, “the sever-
ity will lessen. Our Student Associa-
tiun government structure is still
new, but we are in good company.

The main problems of the past
year's Central Council as outlined
included changing policies to fit the
new structure and the student tax
dilemma. "The idea of faculty as
full voting members on uleglslativc
bully was new,"

"An area which needs consider-
able expansion is jiubllt‘ relations,"
said 'l‘humpson. He said that “per-
haps the biggest challenge for the
Council to meet next year concerns
student welfare." [Jul the most im-
portant thing for the momhcrsofthe
Council is to listen to the voters.

Living Allalrs Winners

The results of the elections were
then announced. Eleanor Diener,
chairman of the Living Affairs Com-
mission for 1965-66 revealed that

mission from the Alumni Quad.

James Krustangel and Tom Merlo
were chosen.

Student Science loumal

In Be Distributed
Today m Annexes

The Student Science Journal, a
collection of science research or-
ticles and abstracts, will be dis-
tributed today in the science and
math departments in Detroit Annex,
llusted Hall and Central Axuiex.

The purpose at the journal is to
encourage writing of papers and
serve as an outlet for papers writ-
ten by math and science students,
Ronald Kujawsld, editor, said that
the journal "gives people exper-
ience in writing papers and toprac-
flee their scientific literary form."

Also it serves as a medium by
which people who are doing work
can be recognized for their re—
search in science,

Many of the papers presented
were given at the Eastern College
Science Conference held March 31
Ithrough April 2.

The journal is 38 pages and be-
cause of this limited space, papers
were limited one per department.

Though the articles are geared
to the math and science student,
any student may obtain a copy of
the Journal.

The department editors of the
publication are Dot McLean, Sue
Thompson, Fred Albrecht, Allan
Jones, Sue Ootken, Charlie Keane
and Betty Walter.
