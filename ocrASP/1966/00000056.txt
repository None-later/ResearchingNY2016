Opening Lead: 3 of hearts

Bidding is employed by bridge
players in order to reach the con-
tract which will achieve the great-
est number of points for their side
on any one hand. This conversation,

_however, is open. The opponents

are listening.

In today's hand, taken from this
year’s intercollegiate par point
championship, East was able to de-
test the contract by taking a clue
from the auction. After cashing two
heart tricks, East led a spade into
the teeth of dummy’s holding!

The play, of course,is completely
logical. South figured to have five
diamonds and five clubs from the
bidding. Since he has already shown
up with two hearts, he can have no
more than one spade.

The setting trick is available in
trump as long as South cannot fi-
nesse East out of his lack. So un-
less South holds a hundred honors
in trumps and has E.S.P., he will

Villnerablem'w not find out about East’s trump

trick until too late.
South, of course, won the spade

EAST in the dummy and led a trump to

his hand. When West showed out on
the second club, there was no way
South could enter the dummy intake
a trump finesse, so he had to go
down.

Watch what happens if East leads
back anything but a spade. South
wins In his hand and plays two rounds
of trump, discovering tllai West is
out. He now leads a spade to dum-
my’s ace and plays the last club
from the dummy. East’s jack is
pickled.

To the Editor:

Having just finished reading the
1966 Torch, i wish to commend
cc-aditors Tomenga and Budd on a
job well-done.

1 would, however, like to bringthe
following fact to the attention of the
cu-edltors. There was not ill the
entirety of the Torch any mention
of the varsity tennis team. except
for the statement which appeared
in the photo essay section that the
team enjoyed a “highly successful
season."

While it is true that the team did
enjoy a highly successful season
(lo-2) it Is a gross error that a
team as outstanding as this one
should not have at least been men-
tioned in the sports section of the
yearbook.

(CPS) Despite the noisy eruptions
of the Peace Rights Organizing Com-
mittee (paoc), political activity
on the Berkeley campus has sim-

mered down to its usual pace this

spring. .

The reason for this is that most
people view the new campus rules
as not bad enough to get angry over.

it is becoming more and more
apparent that most student activists
have tacitly accepted Chancellor
Roger Heyn“ "provisional" rules
on political activity. '

At the same'tline, it has become
obvious that Heyns feels strongly
enough about his rules to carry
them out to the full extent, which
has in the past few weeks meant the
dismissal of three students.

Rules More Restrictive

M the time of the Free Speech
Movement last year, Berkeley’spo-
liticai activity rules were in fact
more restrictive than those in use
throughout the statewide system of
the University of California. The
statewide. rules, commonly called
the Kerr directives, allows for spe-
cific rule‘s at the local level, but
almost all of the campusesfh'ad more
liberal rules than thoseachrkeley.

With the acceptance by the lie-
gents of a new set of statéwide rules
last summer, many of the gripes ‘of
the studehts were alloyed: money
could he collected on campus, litera-
ture could be distributed, members
could be signed up, and all organi-
zations were thrown into the simple
designation of "registered student
organization" if they had achieved
university recognition.

Su biect oi Controversy

The one restriction in the new.

rules that has become the subject of
controversy at Berkeley, and the
main emphasis of PROC's attack
on the rules, is the clause stating
that officers and voting members of
organizations must be students or,
that university facilities cannot be
used by the group. ’  ' '
PROC is clear in its thinking about

Only Activist Groups Complain, _' 

the regulation: "We think'the unl-
versity regulations are ridiculous...
when Chrysler, the Peace Corps,
and the Marine Corps can recruit
on campus and we can't."
PROC‘spokesman go on to accuse
the Berkeley administration ofusing
these regulations to weaken or stifle
anti-war protests. , ,
PROC made its appearance sev-
eral months ago as the Vietnam Day
Committee seemed to be 'wlthering
away. Some observers said that a
split had taken place in the VDC
and that it was actually part of the
V VDC that organized RROC.
it can also be noted that part of
the PROCJeadership is connected
with the Progressive Labor Party,

of the Free Speech Movement or the'
VDC. ~

But In the past few months PRQQ
has been unable to assume the mantle _~
of the VDC_or the FSM and become all
powerful force on the campus. it ‘
rallies have not been well attended

 

and no real protest of a broad-based]

nature occurred when two PRO
members were dismissed for il-‘“
