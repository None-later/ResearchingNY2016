The constitution was the work of

would be able to adapt to a rapidly
changing University.

Meaningtul Government
These motions servie to point out
one of the reasons why the new gov-
ernment has done so well. There
have been a number of people who
have worked unceasingly to bring to
reality a government that was out-

_ lined on paper only a year ago.

One of the popular rationales
heard last year in favor of the
Commission form of government
was that it would provide "govern-
ment at a meaningful level.” It
seemed like a most idealistic phrase
that meant almost nothing.

However, the direction that the
government is heading has brought
meaning to this objective. By in-
volving virtually all campus organ-
izations in some way on one of the
levels of the government, communi-

Professor Publishes Book
(in us. Foreign Policy

Dr. Arthur A. Ekrich, Professor
of History‘ at the University, has
recently had his sixth book, “Ideas,
Ideal, and American Diplomacy"
published by Appleton, Century and
Crofts.

The 220 page work covers Amer-
ican diplomacy, and "describes how
the ideas have influenced foreign
policy, .and how foreign policy has

lights of Bahlria’,
'llake Mine Mink’

"Nights of Cabiria," a film by
the renowned Italian director Fed-
erico Fellini, will be the feature
presented by the International Film
Group Saturday night.

The film's star is Giuletta Ma-
sina, Fellini's wife, who won world-

, wide acclaim for her performances
in "La Strada" and more recently
l‘Juliet of the Spirits."

Fellini is probably the most-
discussed director of our time. All
of his films--“l Viteiloni," “La
Strada," "La Dolce Vita," “8 1/2,"
and now "Juliet" -- have become
centers of controversy. Fellini films
are hizarrelyimaginative, even sur-
realistic; but at the same time they
are intensely and unabashedly emo-
tional. Fellini loves his characters,
even the most villainous and de-
praved, for as he has said, "We
are all creatures of God."

The story is typical Fellini ma-
terial. It centers around a naive
prostitute who does not realize the
degradation, of the world around
her, and thus is drawn into several
brutal and shocking experiences.
Her innocence and trust attracts
men who use her for their own
ends. At the and, a mild-looking
man who says he wants to marry
her, has her sell everything she
owns and takes all her money,
leaving her utteriyalone. What would
he an otherwise depressing tale
ends in a spirit of affirmation as
Cahlria decides to go on living.

liighiy praised at several film
festivals, “Nights ofCabiria" shows
in the words of one critic that
“Fellini just cannot make a film
that is boring or dead.”

influenced ideas.

The book covers theentire course
of American history, from the Revo-
lutionary War and the Isolationist
Tradition, to world leadership and
the cold war policy of containment.

Dr. Ekrich stresses the ideologi-
cal background of American foreign
policy, but also warns that ideas
must not be divorced from reality.
The book should be of great use and
interest to students of American
Diplomacy, as well as to the gen-
era] public.

A graduate of Dartmouth who re-
ceived his Ph.D. from Columbia in
1948, Dr. Ekrich is currently work-
ing on his next book which will
cover the New Deal from an in-
tellectual viewpoint. Although he
has not yet begun to write, Dr.
Ekrich is researching the book in
the Roosevelt Library at Hyde Park.

A good-example of this is the re-
cent handling of budgets hearings
for proposed 1966-1967 monetary
requests. Most of the detailed ques-
tioning was carried on at the corri-
mission , level since these were
people who ostensibly knew some-'
thing about the organizations.

Another area where the commis-
sions are currently acting is in the
orientation program for next fall.

In line with the feelings expressed
by the administration for students to
take a more active role in orienta-
tion, Central Council has delegated
to the commissions the task of de-
veloping orientation programs in
areas of concern to each individual
commission.

Policy Making Character

This past year's Central Council
has helped promote the growth of
a number of new organizations and
has also turned out to be a group
of a policy-making character, in
areas related to student life. This
productivity can be seen by a re-
view of some of the signifith bills
considered and acted upon.

It was last spring and during the
summer that members of Central
Council took part in a committee to
contract for linen services. Last

VD'Program
To Be on TV

The State Medical Society will
present an outspoken educational
program on the subject of venereal.
disease May 14 at 5:00 p.m. on
Channel 10.

The film is in conjunction with a
nationwide campaign to halt the re-
surgence of venereal disease. It is
part of a TV series entitled "Doc-
tors at Work."

Widespread ignorance regarding
venereal disease is greatly respon-
sible for its present prevalence.
"Though recent statistics are
alarming, VD can be wiped out,"
says Dr. James ,Blake, president
of the Medical Society of New York.

Instructive literature on VD cure
and prevention furnished by the
New York Department of Health,
will be offered to viewers on writ-
ten request to the TV stations.

rug that time there was uncertainty
if student tax monies could be given
,-to this group. Subsequent investiga-
tions on this inatter led to the
revelation that rocked the staid foun-

dations of studentAssociationuStu- ‘

dent Tax was not mandatory.

However, through the Student Tax
Committee, policies weredeveloped
to deal with the problem and pub-y
licity programs were evolved to

suit was that 86% of the student body
paid the assessment. ,

steps were begrm to try to have
the tart made mandatory, but it does
not appear that this will be done in
time for next year. So this remains
as a problem for the new Central
Council when it undertakes finan-
cing activities.

New Undertakings

Central Council then resumed its
activity in the fall when it again
supervised the selection of seniors
to Who's Who. The body also ac-
cepted responsibility for the Stu-i
dent Ambassador program, and sub-
sequently subsidized part of the
program.

In October, a new publication,
"Observation," was created. It will
be an annual visual arts magazine.
At the same time, a new policy was
developed for the recognition ofnew.
organizations and their placement
in the government structure.

Two major policy statements were
also passed. A Solicitations Com-
mittee was established and criteria
set down for the granting of per-
mission to private individuals to
solicit on campus.

The other policy was relating to
Political Action groups on campus.
In part, the statement read, “that
not only should such groups be al-
lowed to form, but that they should

be encourandto form."
Election Bill

A seemingly uncontroversial
election bill was passed that led,
in February, to the postponement of
elections for class officers and
MYSKANIA. The challenge of the
bill seemed to centeraround the
constitutionality of the screening
committee for MYSKANIA nomi-
nees.

The first Supreme Court was or-
ganized in the fall. This was the
start of a “new look” in the hand-
ling of judicial business for Student
Association. ‘

requests to Central Council, a re-

One of the major additions to the
policy was the first statement on
salaried positions in Student Asso-
ciation. A basic criteria was set

During the second semester, or-
ganisation was fairly complete.
Work was begun on budgets for the
following year, in face of an un-
known expected income. Atotai bud.
get of' $103,960.50 was finally
passed, allocating money to a record
forty organizations.

Central Council officially joined
the Capital District Intercollegiate
Council, to provide more oppor-
tunities for State's students in the
area.

Chaperene Policy

A recommendation to the admin-
istration for a more liberal chaper-
one policy was defeated, amidst dis-
cussion that it was too liberal or not
liberal enough. However, another
policy recommendation was passed
at the last meeting of the 1965-
1066 Central Council.

This resolution called for action
to be taken to "modify the current
policy concerning the use of alco-
hol in buildings and on grounds
under the jurisdiction of the Uni-
versity, so as to permit consump-
tion of alcohol, with authorized su-
pervision, in the Campus Center, in
other designated locations, and at
special events.”

The volume of business consid-
ered by the council and its commit-
tees was imposing. When one adds
the business of the commissions to
this, it can be seen that the repre-
sentatives participating in all levels
of the government were scarcely
inactive or apathetic.

Central Council 1965-1966 ex-
tended its areas of concern to vir-
tually every facet of student life.
In face of the pessimism that such
a massive structure would never
work, it has succeeded.

The second Central Council is
now in office and it, too, faces a
year of challenges. The basic or-
ganizational work is done, but there
will continue to be a refining of its
workings for greater efficiency.

The challenge of the coming year
will, in a different way, be as de-
manding as the task which the first
council faced.
