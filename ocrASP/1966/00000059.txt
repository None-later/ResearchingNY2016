SEEN FMM ABOVE: Throughout the day the stairwella held
waiting students. A glance down revealed the line stretching
from the second floor down to the first and, at one point, back
up again. '

ALMOST THERE: After many hours the moment that students
have been waiting for has almost arrived. Some begin to wander
if it were worth it and if the courses they want are still open.

IEVERENDING LlN E: the length of the registration line stretched from well to wall u

on the second floor of Draper where
class cards were being pulled. This
scene characterized the building all

. day Monday. .

The monstrous line actually began
to form at about 1:00 a.m. when ap-
proximately six students begantheir
all night vigil on the back steps of
Draper. They appeared. to sleep
soundly in spite of the biting cold.

The security guard kept watch
over them throughout the night. He
commented that someone had gone
by and reported some dead bodies
on the steps of the building. He
grinned paternally and said, “They
were dead all right, dead to the
world."

Students Rewarded

These students were rewarded for
their efforts. They entered Draper
about 5:30 to be the first in line.
At 6:00 a.m. girls appeared on the
scene as quickly as they could rush
from the dorms. One group arrived
in a taxi at 6:10 to become numbers
80-85 in line.

Before the card-pulling began at
8:30, students slept on the floor

their spot in line. Everything was

fine until the buses arrived at 8:00
and swarms of uncontrollable line-
breakers invaded the peaceful scene.
Until this time students had little
trouble maintaining their places.

Line-cutters irritated the honest
standees throughout the trying day.
One girl _who had been standing in
line since 6:00 am. spoke bitterly
of another girl who had had the
nerve to cut in at 8:00 a.m. and
then complain about the length of
time she had to stand.

Spirit High

During the whole period, spirit
was high. Most students laughed
and made jokes about their aches
and pains. All were willing to offer
their opinion about the system which
was apparent to everyone.

“This is the best example of Uni-
versity spirit I’ve ever seen," com-
mented one girl. "There’s no apathy
when it comes to this." Students
cooperated with one another as one
would hold the place in line while
another would go for coffee or sand-
wiches.

Friendships developed as students
shared this commonexperlence.with
amenable camaraderie. “How
ironic," said one veteran of the
line," here we are fighting to get
into classes." Every so often a
burst of laughter could be heard or
an announcement of misplaced books
or clothing was made.

"If they want to' increase the
number of students who vote, they
should hold voting along with regis-
tration since the students are here

with their tax cards," commented
one conscientious student. _ ,

While freshmen, sophomores and
juniors stood in line, class periods
~c'am'e and went but few paid~any
attention. Most felt that the sacri-
fice'of one day of classes was worth
it to get the courses they wanted
next semester. Some 8 and9o’ciock
classes were cancelled because of
a lack or students.

At ‘11 am. psychology students
began asking revealing questions for
experiments. Students admitted that
they were cutting classes and in-
tended to cut more. They stood in
line on an average of three hours.
Some juniors remembered when they
had had to stand in line for eight
hours when they. were freshman.

.As the humor of the situation
began to wear thin and the serious-
ness'of the problem became ap-
parent, students asked why it had
happened and what was to be done
about it in future days and future
semesters. Administrators sur-
veyed the line and realized that
something had to be done.

By 2:00 pm. a 'new plan was
formulated for the succeeding days.
The letters "La" were chosen at
random and the schedule accord-
ing to last name continued from
there.’At 4:30 the registrar and
her staff were finishing a hard days
work and Draper was once again
merely a quiet building with few
signs of a hectic happening. The
day of the big line was finally ended.

EVERYONE'S GOAL: Students sat behind tables on the second
floor of Draper selecting cards for students who stood as many
as five hour's waiting for their turn.

FACIAL EXPRESSIONS: The upturned faces of weary students
express a variety of thoughts. Some laugh at their plight while
others merely look puzzled as they wonder what happened to
cause such an assemblage of people to form.

BROTHERS IN ACTION: The blur is the bathtub as Up Phi Sig

Upsilon Phi Sigma Members
oonsor First Service Project

A bathtub thrown out of a second
floor window, the back porch of a
house wrenched off by twenty col-
lege boys -- this is the first com-
munity project sponsored by the
University’s newest fraternity, Up-
silon Phi Sigma.

"Constructive wrecking" is the
term applied to the phenomena by
the brothers of Upsilon Phi Sigma,
and Pastor Craig 0! the Madison
Avenue Presbyterian Church would
agree.

The brothers are aiding in tearing
down sections of a house which has
been purchased by the United Coun-
cil of Churches in the Albany area.

The first of several fraternity
sponsored community services
planned by Up Phi Sig, the project
was initiated by John Howiand, who
was contacted by Pastor Craig.

The boys volunteered their help
immediately, and the result has been
a project which has actively in-
voiyed twenty of the twenty-six
brothers.

After renovation, the buildingwill
be utilized for offices for the district
Counciiand will also house a recrea-

Foreign Student
Friendly, lackin

“Basically I am here in Amer -
ca to meet Americans.” Two years
at the State University at Albany
have given Maria Georgiopolis, a
foreign student from Athens,
Greece, an opportunity to observe
and experience American life, and
have left her with well-expressed
opinions on many facets of it.

Beginning her stay as a freshman
in September 1964, Maria came here
through a Fulbright Scholarship,
and was also aided by the funds
raised during the annual State Fai
Weekend. ‘

Now in her sophomore year, she
is an English major, and plans to
complete her undergraduate work
here.

~ Lived in Rhodesia

Maria spent the first ten years
of her life in Northern Rhodesia,
now Zambia, in Africa. She has
traveled extensively on that conti-
ent, as well as in Southern France
and ltaly.

in Athens, Maria attended an
American Field Service School,
learning much about this country
from her classmates, who were of-
ten children of Americans stationed
at the U. S. Army base near the city.

After applying to Fulbright and
enduring screening processes, ex-
aminations, and “millions and mil-
lions” of forms, she was notified
by the Institute of International Ed-
ucation that she had received a
grant to study here.

tion room for neighboring young-
sters.

Henry Muller, president of UPS;
commented, "we feel that although
Upsilon Phi Sigma is primarily a
social fraternity, both campus and
community projects such as these
are an integral part of the Greek
experience.

“Besides, where else can we
tear a house down?"

Sigma Alpha

The ASP afich its apologies to
Sigma Alpha Sorority for its failure
to print the names of the girls in
the Spring Pledge Class.

The following girls have been
initiated as sisters: Joan Bowers,
Marianne DiNapoli, Barb Elliot,
Carol Greene, Judy Haupin, Linda
Jarboe, Marjorie Miele, Carol Mow-
ers, Judy Mysliborski, Martha
Proulx, Ronnie Sharp, Pat Shoe-
maker, Marie Zazersky, Barb Bur-
dick, Mary Coffey, Brenda Dohnalek,
Jeanne Dross, Carol Jenny, Anna-'
belle Slack, Phyllis Tencza, Margie

Finds Americans
in Individuality

"Certain people, philosophy, mu-
sic, and art” are Maria’s major
interests. Her love of reading lead
her into a job at the John Mistletoe
Bookstore, which she finds enjoy-
able and stimulating. r

Commenting on the university,
Maria finds the students “friendly”
and has found many close friends
here. She praised the academic
standing, and finds the English de-
partment particularly good.

She confesses, though, that she
finds an attitude among the students
which she finds disturbing. “What
i find lacking is that most people
don’t live their education. They
leave it in the classroom.”

Classroom Discussron Ends

Maria stated, “We came to the
University to pursue learning," but
she finds that when classroom dis-
cussion ends, consideration of
classroom topics also ends, and is
seldom carried on outside of school.

"In general there seems to be no
one willing to agree, discuss, or
debate, on serious issues once out
of the classroom."

Contrasting Americans with
Europeans, Maria finds a kind of
national apathy also. More Ameri-
cans say or do things because their

ieighhors or friends do, and not
oecausc they have thought about
(hem.
(I lack of individuality is more
apparent here -- no one ever chal-
lenges what you sav."

fiftieth anniversary Saturday, April
30, with dining and dancing at the
DeWitt Clinton Hotel. The celebra-
tion was heightened by the return
of over one hundred alums, includ-
ing two of the original founders.

The alumnae and sisters met over
cocktails and the Alumnae Luncheon
from noon to 3:00 p.m., and then
attended the Annual Alumnae Meet-
ing.
Mrs. Ethel Rooney Hall, Class of
1929 and one of the members of
Beta Zeta's first pledge class, was

' the alumnae speaker. in an informal

speech Mrs.‘ Hall recalled the days
when Beta Zeta was founded as a
secret society by six members of
the Class of 1918.

Na Dormitories

At that time “State College," as
it was called then, had no dormi-
tories. Students who were not com-
muters boarded in housing approved
by the college.

It was from a boarding house of
this sort, located on South Lake
Street, in a back bedroom, that Beta
Zeta was founded.

Mrs. Rooney spoke of the differ-
ences between needs satisfied by
sororities then and today. Although
she felt that they were just as
helpful today, she spoke of them
originating in a more basic effort

to unite anyone under- the conditions'

then existing.

State College at that time con-
sisted of Draper, Husted and the
Chapel. (The Milne High School oc-
cupied the top floor of Draper.)

No Union
There was no cafeteria, no Union,

=-and no Campus life to speak of.

And, as college girls of the 1920's
weren't supposed to drink, there
was no Yezzi's.

She commented on what a heart-
warming feeling it was, at that
time, to have something to belong
to. of the six original sisters, all
are still in touch with each other.

h by. Janet snua ’
be, the Senior weaker, President
Vera Komanowski handed out awards
and gifts to the alums, including
an award for the BZ married longest
to a Potter Man.

Original Fina

The gift of two of the original
BZ pins was another" high point of
the meeting. The pin, the very first
pin of Hz, which in 1910 cost $2.50
will become part of the Sophomore
Award given to the sophomore who
has done the most for the sorority.

This year's Sophomore Award
was given to Colette Lundy, who
‘win keep the pin until the next
year when it will be handed down
to the next recipient of the award.

Sharyn O’Reiliy, recipient of the
Junior Award, will receive a pin
which one of the original BZ's
still wears today. Her pin, too,
will be handed down. '

Dinner Dance

The Alumnae Association also
sponsored a cocktail hour and din-
ner Saturday evening also at the

The general feeling among the
sisters was that it was wonderful

to view the spirit shown by the
urns.

CLEANLIN ESS: Cleaning up is as important as tearing up, as
these Up Phi Sig brothers found out.
