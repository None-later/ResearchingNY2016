further Removal Unnecessary

Not many more words of reproval can be said con-
‘cerning the registration fiasco which resulted in a
gigantic line in Draper on Monday. Those who were at
fault realize the mistakes they made. It was no one
persons fault so no one-person can get the blame.
Even if the plan had not called for this delay in card
pulling, it was impossible to have the cards ready
before they were. .

The move to the new campus next year was partly
the cause. It was impossible to schedule the classes
until the availability of the rooms was determined.
This held up the final preparation of the cards. Aca-
demic advisement could not be delayed because it
takes a full six weeks to complete freshman advise-
ment.

The annoyed looks on the faces of the students is
enough of a reprimand. Let’s hope this “new” and
“improved” plan is completely destroyed and another
one devised in future semesters.

New council Shows Promise

The .1966-67 Central Council will have a hard time
. maintaining the record of accomplishment which the
t; first Central Council has established durings its year

  
 
 

 

 olf.action. A mere glance at a summary of its activi-
.,. t1es shows only a portion of the picture. The hours
I: which the members put in and the results which they
1; achieved cannot be measured or described on paper.
* The fact that it was the first explains why it would
be a more difficult job than if it were a long-established
governing body which had precedents to fall back on.
The individuals on this first council played a great part
in its.success.

The new president, William Cleveland, will be one
of the determining factors in the success of this new
council. So far he has shown himself capable of the
tasks he has undertaken. He. along with the new mem-
bers. present a promising outlook for next year’s
government which makes many decisions important
to every student.

 

. ' lay Lobr Kursw

 Kimono: the as.“ student sov-

ernment can. point with pride to its
many achievements, ~there is one
area which this, and other student
governments in the past, have great--
ly neglected.

The constitutions of almost every
organization under Student Associa-
tion contain attendance require-
ments for their members, inappli-
cable only in the cases _of student
teaching, illness, death in the family,
or through excuse by the chairman
of the respective organization.

, Most ofthese constitutions furthur
state that failure to meet the atten-
dance requirement will result in
removal of the member from office.

Although there are many examples
of violations of this requirement,
no organization has taken action to
discipline its members. The fault
lies not only with the irresponsible
and hypocritical attendance delin-
quents, but also with the executive
officers of the various organiza-

 
   

. bl iii".

tions, hose responsibility’it is‘to
enforce the provisions of their-con-
stitutione. ‘ __
Perhaps the problem also results
from the awkward procedures which-
have been set up to implement the
attendance policy.

lnany case, the new government
might well keep in mind the history
of Senate, ,with its constant lack of
quorums and ultimate collapse, and
demand that the attendance policy
be enforced by the executive, by
whatever procedure they may
choose.

St. Rose to Present

Color Bias Pervades Whole Culture,
Roots Found in White Man Himself

by Dr. Richard Wilkie

For about two years now, James
Lockhart and I have been doing a
program called "Jim Crow in Per-
speciive.” The program, which
combines dramatic reading and folk
music, is designed for the middle
class white audience--designed, that
is, to show the white audience how
they look to black America, and
how the black man in America really
feels about the “system” created
by the white man.

The formal part of the program
lasts just 35 minutes, and then Jim
and l carry on a dialogue with our
audience... often for two hours or
more. From these dialogues we have
learned something about white
America.

Suffers From Racism

I think the “effective majority"
of white America suffers from a
kind of emotional pathology called
“racism”  a pathology very much
like other kinds of personal mental
illness, except that racism has ser-
ious social symptoms while other
kinds of mental illness may not
necessarily have such.

It may surprise you that I draw a
parallel between racism and emo-
tional illness or pathology, but cer-
tain things are then explainable that
are simply not so otherwise. Take
a look, for example,at three aspects
of white racism: INDIFFERENCE,
GUILT PROJECTION, and aIRRA-
TIONALITY.

Many of the white people in our
audiences say that they do notknow,
that they have never heard of the
injustice, brutality, and ostracism
practiced by the white power struc-
ture against the Negro.

They are also characteristically
unaware of the emotional havoc this
treatment leaves behind in the Negro
community. And I ask why? How
come? How about a mother and
father, perhaps like your parents,
who do not, or did not know that
you were miserable and unhappy?

How about the parents who"didn't
know" until toolate thattheir daugh-
ter was in trouble, or that their son
was about to flunk out of school, or
hooked on dope, or otherwise in-
volved in destructive behavior?

How about that kind of “indiffer-
ence?” Now, most any family psy-
chologist or practicing psychothera-
pist would tell you that the parents
are in emotional trouble too, and
that their “indifference” or "un-
knowingness" is a defense.

I have learned from years of
teaching that a bored, indifferent
student is often a hostile or fright-
ened one, and that his “cool” is a
shield. And if you think I’m putting
down students, let me add that col-
lege professors have their fears,
hostilities, and their defenses too.

Racial Indifference

How about racial indifference,
then, how about the white man who
remains indifferent toward the bru-
talities through which he daily walks,
or carefully avoids seeing, and for
which his system is largely respon-
sible?

Feelings of guilt are hard to live
with, hard to face up to.Mostpeople
try to pass off these feelings, or
blame someone or something else.
During our audience dialogues, Jim
and I often get the response: "...
but Negroes are prejudiced too...
they discriminate against their own,
so what’s the big deal 1”

The painful situation is clear: it
is very difficult for the white man
to face the) grim fact that ostracism
based on ‘ degree of darkness" is a
central value in this culture-- his
culture, in which the money, the
political power, and the institutions
are controlled by white people.

Bios Pervodes Culture

is it any wonder that a “color
bias" pervades the whole culture
when it is a leading force in the
centers of power? And isn't it in-
teresting that most polite, white
southerners would like everyone to
believe that the Klan. and the Klan

l COMMUNICATIONS

To the Editor:

At this time I am greatly pleased
that Mr. William Cleveland has be.
come the student Association Presi-
dent. He has demonstrated the re-
sponsibility necessary to guide a

i still unsettled government in the

years to colour

Yet, it has been brought to my
attention that this paper has made
an error. One of the recommended
candidates for the position of Con.
tral Council, although he may have
the qualifications, lacked the re-

alone, is responsible for racism in
the South.

Is it not well understood, as well,
that irrationality is a hallmark of
mental illness. If the honor student
who dives out of a 5th floor dorm
window because he feels himself a
failure can be called irrational, then
why not also the white man who
cannot really believe in and accept
the reality ofthe black man as simply
a human being, no more or no less,
even when the "evidence" for such
a belief is all about him?

Roots in White Man

White racism, then, like all emo-
tional pathology, finds its roots, not
in external reality,notinthe “Negro
problem," but in the white man him-
self. lnjustice and brutality exist,
in reality, as operating principles of
our society, but they pass unnoticed
by all too many white people.

From within the white man him-
self comes the urge to blame every-
one and everything else, and to re-
main essentially irrational in his
attitude toward the black man, no
matter the evidence, nor persuasion
to the contrary.

Scientists to Hold
Int Conference,

The Sixth International Confer-
ence on Condensation Nuclei wih be
held at the University and Pennsyl-
vania State University May 9-12

Atmospheric scientists from 12
countries will gather here for the
first four sessions after which the
group will go to University Park,
Pennsylvania for the second half of
the conference. .

While in Albany, the meetings will
be held in the Health Department
building to take advantage of the
special facilities available. One ses-
sion will be held at the research
laboratory of the General Electric
Company in Schenectady.

During their visit the scientists
will be greeted by Governor Rocke-
feller at their opening session Mon-
day morning and will be the guests
of the University at a dinner on the
new campus Tuesday evening.
Vincent Schaefer, director of re-
search at the University’s Atmos-
pheric Science Research Center,
will chair one session and deliver
a a or

       

sponsibtlity on a lower level of
student government.

He was dismissed as a repre-
sentctive from his position on Dorm
Council due to non-attendance.

1 hope in the near future the ASP
will give greater time and consid.
eration to its recommendations.
These recommendations should not
be haphazard choices without thor-
ough deliberation on the responsi-
bility of each candidate.

Any critique of the State Univer-
sity Revue production of "Gypsy"
must be prefaced by the statement
that it is very obvious to anyone
in the audience that a great deal of
time, money and effort went into
the production.

There were great spots and ter-
rible spots; the acting, singing and
dancing ranged from the profession-
al to the amateur and thus it be-
comes difficult to decide whether
the show was, ultimately, a suc-
cess or not.

Carol Rosenthal is a metaphor
for the whole production. At cer-
tain moments (e.g. “Small World)
everyone was captivated by her
performance or during “Rose’s
Turn” the silence of the viewers
showed that Miss Rosenthal had
captured the necessary poignancy
for her role.

Big Mouth
However the role of Mama Rose
requires someone with a “big
mouth" someone raucous and bois-

terous. While Miss Rosenthal__was

Hegyi Named llew
Conductor oi Albany
Symphony orchestra

by Morclo Smith

. With the beginning of the Mem—
bership Drive and Ticket Sales Cam-
paign at the May 2 Concert, the
Albany Symphony Orchestra an-
nounces its guest artists and dates
for the five concert series of its
thirty-sixth season, with Julius Heg-
yi as conductor.

Mr. Hegyi was the former con-
ductor of the Chattanooga Symphony
Orchestra for ten years and is
presently the conductor of the Berk-
shire Symphony and visiting lec—
turer in chamber music at Williams
College.

Directional Ability

His directional ability won him
and the Chattanooga Symphony the
Alice M. Ditson Memorial Award
in 1962 for outstanding service to
contemporary music. In 1959 he
received a national Conductor Rec-
ognition Award from the American
Symphony Orchestra League, and he
also has been a prize winner in the
Liverpool, England Conductor’s
Competition.

Berkshire Symphony

Since taking over these posts at
Williamstown, Mr. Hegyi has ap-
peared as violinist with the Berk-
shire Symphony playing his own
fine Stradivarius; he has directed
several Music in the Round pro-
grams; and this past August was
on the performing staff ofthe Twen-
tieth Bennington Composer's Con-
ierence.

The opening concert of the Albany
Symphony's thirty-sixth season is
especially designed to exhiin the
talents and virtuosity of its prin-
cipal musicians and new conductor,
and to demonstrate to the Capital
District its appreciation for their
continued support.

 or: in

packed with energy she lacked the

projection necessary to be fully

 

convincing. Also she sometimes
overdid her gestures, such as in
“Some People." ‘

Carla Pinelli’s voice speaks (or
rather sings) for itself. Yet her role
in this production seemed subdued
and her talents were not exploited
except for her duo with Coleen
Hanna, "If Momma Was Married.”

Fociol Gestures

Joe Nicastri, as Herbie, has no
singing voice so it is a good thing
that he is a superb actor. His hand
and facial gestures as well as his
ability to load the audience where-
ever he walked made him a stand-
out.

Art Johnston, unfortunately, had
the zest but not the musical quali-
ties essential for his part. "All I
Need Is The Girl” was not one of
the high points in the show. Coleen
Hanna was competent, especially
during "If Momma Was Married."

There were several very striking
minor roles. Ellis Kaufman as Yon-
kers seems right at home on the
stage, especially in high hat and
cane. Frank Petrone, as Mr. Gold-
stone (also as Cigar) was an ex-

ample of pei‘fedﬁ‘chtlnnglda Kra-
Rover, as Pop and P'setey showed his
ability to really climb inside sro'le.

 

Judy Jawltz, as melmls really r ;

a standout. Her voice contained the
very sound of a jazzy trumpet.

Demanding Director ‘

Several things can be said about
John Foils. He is ambitious, imag-
inative and, no doubt, demanding.
While some of his touches failed,
there were enough Fotia innova-
tions for an audience to note the
guiding hand of a director with orig-
inality. One example of this was the
passing of time when Miss Pinelii
first made her appearance.

The orchestra for the main part
was highly satisfactory, although
there were a few lapses.

There are a lot of shows which
would have been far less costly,
and much less technically difficult,
to produce. It is a credit to Join
Fotin, Carol Rosenthal and the wholi
supporting cast that such a tre~~
mendous undertaking came off as
well-as it did.
