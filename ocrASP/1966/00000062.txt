excellent choices.

Review of La Batarde by Violette Leduc (New Yarltr Farrar, Straus &
Giroux): I965 .

' This long coalessionds s strange mixture 01 unsdornsd sincerity and
poetic monologue. The story at the author’s ﬁrst torty years was not only
a succes de scandsle early in 1963, but was acclaimed by many as s most
striking book of imaginative literature. Violette Leduc’s totally uninhibited
description at her Leiden loves doubtlessly contributes tothe book's erotic
content, but, selnsllher other books to date, these descriptions are neither
gratuitous nor, deliberately sensations; . . ‘ '

Her mother, abandoned by Violetie's {allur'bstore they were married,
saw. to it that Violette was aware that she was EEMMMELO‘ e'condemned
sex, threatened by all males. When Isabelle, One ’0! her'clse’smstes at
school, introduced her to sensual pleasure, _ she was shattered by the
transilgurstion at her body into a garden of delights. Doomed to what is
called abnormal love, she became its champion. For her, eroticism Is

- the master key to the world and in order to speak of it she has lorged tor
_ V ‘hersell a language devoid oi sentimentality and Vullll‘ity. -

Violette would tell into irequent crisssuoi 'ileprfoeuiqnjollowmg her’
passionate attraction to Other girls or, more rarely, to males, either
homosexual or those longing tor sn amorous and intellectual irisndship
rather than a physical union. One of these men was Maurice Sachs who
was probably the-most important male in Violetts’s lite, and whose un-
Ideslised portth iills the unallnction oi the book. Sachs, who encouraged
her to write, was intrigued by Violette, whose ﬁsshisn tastes'heist once
sensed. She readily realised thsi he was a homcsexuel.'se.chs ‘was llrosdy
known in France and abroad as the author ole brilliant autobiograpshy,

'"WItches' Sabbath." They were ins‘spa‘rablgﬂugngjhe, esrlyyosrs o]

'is perhaps Jean (‘mnt who in 1945 was among the ioudept to acclaim her

at the occasion at her first published writing,- “L’Asphyxle,” which the
late Albert‘Cemue had. accepted tor his Espoir series. Simone de Beau-

This closeness- to the Existentialist group is hét sill-prisingconsiderlng

merevgestures into responsible actions and thereby become an 'iauihen-

is ended is the‘bsstard who, because at her Inability to relate to others,
has” achieved that privileged form of communication: a workoi art.
