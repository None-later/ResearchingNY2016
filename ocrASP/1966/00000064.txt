TRADITION: ‘They Laughed When We Sat Down at the World’

At 2 am. on October 14, 1960,
on the steps of the University, of
Michigan‘s Student Union Building
in Ann Arbor, history's lightning
struck sparks that were to become
visible around the world.

Today an engraved plaque on a
front wall of the building calls atten-
tion to the fact that at that time
and place John F. Kennedy ﬁrst
publicly mentioned the idea of a
Peace Corps and deﬁned its aims.

Kennedy. then nearing the end of
his successful candidacy for Presi-
dent, had just fiown into Michigan
from New York. As his motorcade
made its way from the airport to
Ann Arbor, it became evident that
a large crowd of students had waited
up to see and hear him. The caravan
was greeted at the university by an
audience estimated at 10,000.

Speaking extemporaneously from
the steps of- the Student Union,
Kennedy asked:

“How many of you are willing to
spend 10 years in Africa or Latin
America or Asia working for the
0.5. and working for freedom? How
many of you (who) are going to be
doctors are willing to spend your
days in Ghana? . . . On your willing-
ness to do that, not merely to serve
one or two years in the service. but
on your willingness to contribute
part of your life to this country. I

think, will depend the answer
whether we as a free society can
compete "

national, secular organization of
volunteers devoted to overseas serv-
ice camc from several quarters.

Vice President Hubert H. Humph-
rey. then a senator from Minnesota,
had given the idea on early boost
by submitting a Peace Corps bill in
the summer of 1960. But it was not
until a speech in San Francisco dur-
ing the waning days of the presiden-
tial campaign - November 2. I960
— that John F. Kennedy sounded
the note that reverberated through
the American mind.

Kennedy‘s campaign pledge to
send “the best Americans we can
get to speak for our country abroad"
caused an instantaneous stir across
the nation. Mail cascaded into
Washington. One of the ﬁrst things

the new President Kennedy did after
taking office was to direct his
brother-in-Iaw Sargent Shriver to
determine whether foreign govern-
ments were interested in receiving
Volunteers.

Organizational work went ahead
quickly after reports came back
from Asia and Africa that Volun-
teers, in surprisingly large numbers.
would be welcome. The Peace Corps
Wu established by Executive Order
on March l, 1961.

he idea was not without its
critics. As one agency executive puts
it. “They laughed when we sat down
at the world to play . . ." And like
the famed advertising slogan about
the man who stirpriscd one and all
with his new-found talent at the
piano. some of the Peace Corps'
most vocal critics became avid
boosters.

Final legislation providing for a
permanent organization was signed
by President Kennedy on September
22, I961.

The legislation appropriated $32
million to run the agency in its ﬁrst
full ﬁscal year—July 1. I961. through
June 30. 1962 (the budget is now
$115 million). At the same time
Congress added to the basic Peace
Corps Act these three goals:

I. To help the people of develop-
ing nations meet their needs for
trained manpower.

2. To help promote a better un-
derstanding of other peoples on the
part of the American people.

EDUCATION: How to Melt

What we found wrong with a lot
of early Peace Corps training. based
on reports from returned Volun-
teers. was that it contained
many lectures. too much 'onc-way
instruction and too little direct
experience."

That statement by Harris Wof-
ford, Peace Corps Associate Di-
rector for Planning. Evaluation and
Research. marks the main thrust of
a new Education Task Force.

Its purpose: to make Peace Corps
training more like the overseas real-
ity and less like a mere extension
of classroom education.

"Freedom and responsibility are
what Volunteers generally ﬁnd over-
seas." notes Wofford, who heads the
Task Force. “But for some of the
moat unstructured jobs in the world
we have put together some of the
most structured training programs."

He says Freud‘s description of
child-rearing has applied to much
of Peace Corps training: "We train
them for the tropics and send them
to the polar Ice cap."

The Education Task Force is de-
signing new 1966 programs that
will concentrate on starting proc-

“too ‘

csscs of learning that will con-
tinue overseas. instead of trying
to cram facts into Volunteers‘ heads
during stateside classroom sessions.

The Task Force has recommended
that even more of the training take

place outside the college campus. in
radically unfamiliar environments:
slums or rural areas or Job Corps
camps. on in other ctilttircs such as
Puerto Rico. or in the foreign coun-
tries themselves.

3. To help promote a better un-
derstanding of the American people
on the part of the peoples served.

ln mid-I961 Lyndon B. Johnson,
then Vice President, was named the
ﬁrst chairman of the Peace Corps
National Advisory Council, which is
made up of outstanding Americans
who meet twice a year to review
Peace Corps programs and policies.
He held the post until January 26,
1965, when he named Vice Presi-
dent Humphrcy as his successor on
the council, assuring continued Ad-
ministration support of the Peace
Corps.

On August 30. 1961, the ﬁrst

group of Volunteers to go abroad
arrived in Ghana. At the end of

Junior Year Program Enlarged for ’66

The I’eace Corps is expanding its
training program for college juniors.
Jules Paguno, Peace Corps training
operations director. has announced
that 1,000 juniors will begin the
Advance Training Program this
summer.

The program enables future Vol-
unteers to integrate Peace Corps
training and their senior year of
college. with beneﬁtson both sides.
“It gives us 15 months to prepare
the Volunteer for his assignment In-
stead of the normal three." Pagano
said.

The ATP was begun in the sum-
mer of 1964. when 200 college
juniors entered training for assign-

ments that began in Scptcmbcr 1965.
They trained the ﬁrst summer at
United States universities, continued
their preparation independently dur-
ing their senior year of school and
completed training in special field
programs the summer of 1965.

The Peace Corp: has a loan fund
for ATP enrollces to help cover the
loss of income otherwise gained
from summer employment. Trainees
may borrow up to $600 at low
interest rates to pay expenses during
their final year in school.

ATP was developed as a solution
to the increasing difficulty of pre-
paring Volunleera for certain assign-
ments. Some Peace Corps Volun-

teers must learn two languages to
trundle their work cllcclivcly. such
as teachers bound for French-speak-
ing Africa where various Africun
languages are spoken us well us the
olliciul French.

Some ATI’ cnrollecs trained for
West Africa at Dartmouth College
in the summer of I964. The next
summer they trained in Quebec
Province. Canada. where they lived
with French-speaking families and
practice-taught French-speaking stu-
dents.

Juniors qualified to enter ATP
next summer will train for assign-
ments in 16 countries.

I961 there were 614 Volunteers in
13 countries.

In some nations, the arriving Vol.
untcers were greeted with shouts of
“Go home, Yankees." Such taunts
usually have been replaced by the
request, "Send us some more I’cacc
Corps Volunteers."

In nations long cynical about the
motives of the great world Which,
the Peace Corps approach was re-
freshing.

By June 1962. more than IIIIII)
Volunteers were at work in 15 mun-
trics. and nearly 3.000 were ill 11.1m-
ing. Agreements for Voluntch had
been reached with 37 countrics.

By Jttne 30, 1963. there were
about 4,000 Volunteers ovcrscus In
more than 40 countries. \I‘llll :rn-

 MAKING OF A Pcv

Fla/0’ Experience Supplements Classroom Tram/77g

Joining the Peace Corps today
can be both easier and harder than
ever before. but it's deﬁnitely
quicker.

The key to the continuing high
quality of Peace Corps Volunteers
(PCVs) is the selection process
where a staff headed by the psy-
chologist who helped choose the
ﬁrst U. S. Astronauts weighs the
background and indicated abilities
of each applicant against the list of
available assignments.

It‘s a little easier to become a
Volunteer today simply because
there are many more jobs available.
This year the Peace Corps will at-
tempt to ﬁll the largest batch of
requests ever—7,000 Volunteers to
work in nearly 300 job categories in
46 host countries.

0n the other hand it's also more
difficult to join today‘s Peace Corps
because the selection process gives
greater recognition to job compe-
tence, requiring more sophistication
in some categories and placing more
emphasis on ﬁnding exactly the
right person for a speciﬁc assign-
ment.

Faster Acceptance

The selection system has been
constantly re-examined and reﬁned
in the five years since applicant 001
ﬁlled out his Questionnaire. After
sifting more than 160,000 applica-
tions. the selectors have a fair idea
of what makes a potentially good
PCV, and today the typical appli-
cant can expect to know within six
weeks from the time the Peace
Corps receives his application
whether he will be invited to serve.

IMPACT: Can You

W t y t. 1!

Does the Peace Corps have a
measurable effect on a country?

The ﬁrst attempt at answering
that difﬁcult question has been made
by a team of anthropologists from
Cornell University who have just
turned in the ﬁrst scientiﬁc study of
the impact of Volunteers assigned to
communities in the Peruvian Andes.

The results of this scientiﬁc study
fill a 329-pagc report which details
two years of on-the-spot research in
15 communities where Volunteers
were active in community develop-
ment work. using as a control ﬁve
other villages where no Volunteers
had been assigned.

General conclusion of the study:
Peace Corpsmcn do make a differ-
cncc. Among the ﬁndings is that
Peace Corps communities progressed
at a rate some 2.8 times faster than
those communities without Volun-
tcers.

Peace Corps Director Sargent
Shriver views the report as being of
"great practical and historical sig-
niﬁcancc."

“For the first time we have ob-
jective, scientiﬁc validation of the
successes Volunteers are registering
in the ﬁeld of community develop-
ment. It is hard, demanding work in
isolated areas under sometimes diffi-
cult und frustrating conditions, btit
the report shows that the Volunteers
have been successful even beyond
our initial hopes."

Self-Help Program

He said that about one third of
all Volunteers and more than half
of the 4,000 now in Latin America,
are engaged in community develop
ment work, i.e., teaching democracy
on a community level. encouraging
people to work together to solve
their own problems.

The subjects were 50 Peace
Corpsmen. the first Volunteers in
the Andes. They operated in com-
munities located in spectacular
mountain country at extreme alti-
tudes (some as high as 13.000 feet).
Inhabited by the Indian descend-

If a Peace Corps applicant makes
it through the preliminary selec-
tion process. he is invited to a 13-
week training program at one of
more than 100 American tiniversities
or colleges where his special Peace
Corps curriculum will include:

I Language training—total “im-
mersion" in an intensive program of
tip to 300 hours that leads to early
conversational ability. Previous
knowledge of the languzige is not
a requirement.

I Technical studies — skills needed
for the type of work he will per-
form.

I Area studies—background in the
culture in which he will work.

I American studies — refresher
courses in U. S. history, geography.
institutions.

I World affairs —- background in
current events.

I Health -—— training in which the
Volunteer learns to protect himself
and also acquires cdticational tech-
niques to improve health conditions
in the host country.

Volunteers whose assignments
overseas call for strenuous physical
conditioning are given additional
training for outdoor living which
may include hiking. rock-climbing,
swimming and map reading. Pro-
ﬁciency in these activities. however,
is not required. While such train-
ing was recommended for future
community development workers in
the mountains of Chile, for example,

 

 

‘ it would- not necessarily be required

for someone planning to teach Eng-
lish in an urban setting.
Rated By Peers

The selection process continues
throughout training. Each trainee
receives a thorough medical check-
up, a psychiatric screening and a
full background investigation. He is
judged.by each of his instructors
and rated by his peers.

0n the basis of all available in-
formation. the overall suitability of
each trainee is continually evaluated
during training and at’the end of the
training period. About three out
of four trainees are sworn in as
Peace Corps Volunteers.

“In the beginning. training was
preparation for Peace Corps service;
now it is a part of Peace Corps
service," says Jules l’aguno. acting
director of the Division of Univer-
sity Relations and Training.
“Learned Through Experience"

“We used to try to cram people
with as much information as pos-
sible. plus all the language and
physical training we could manage.
and hope the exposure would pre-
pare them for their service overseas.
We learned through experience that
this was not enough. The transi-
tion between preparation and actual
doing was not adequate—some-
times not even relevant.

“As a result. we have tried to
integrate all the components of the
training program into real-life ex-
periences in the ﬁeld. based on the
needs of speciﬁc projects and coun-
tries," Pagano explained. “The
training period has been expanded
to 13 weeks with at least three

FIELD WORN—Physical conditioning is only one aspect of Peace Corps

training. While candidates such as these who are bound for mountain

destined for urban teaching and community development assignments
may train in New York or Puerto Rico slums or teaching on an Indian

reservation.

of those weeks devoted to actual
ﬁeld assignments such as work-
ing in the slums of New York
or Puerto Rico, practice teaching
on Indian reservations or doing
community development in thc Vir-
gin Islands."

Another change in the training
program is greater concern with the
total learning process. he said.

“We are trying to make every-
thing in the program relevant to
the Peace Corps experience," he
pointed out. "Training is now more
generally educational, rather than
just 'how to.‘ More attention is
being paid to attitudes and sensi-
tivities in preparing trainees for
their cross-cultural experiences."

Dr. Henry F. Dobyns, one of the
Cornell research team leaders. dc-
scribing the report's ﬁndings. said
that in the field of community de-
velopment “results are normally
computed over the course of dec-
ades . . . these Volunteers produced
measurable results In two years.
Some would consider this progress
incredible."

Titles of Two Villages
The study. however, is a human

as well as a scientiﬁc document. and
it reports candidly on the Peace
Corps' failures as well as its stic-
ccsses.

The authors (Dr. Dnbyns. Dr.
Allan R. Holmbcrg. chairman of the
Cornell anthropology department
and Dr. Part! L. Doughty. now on
the Indiana University faculty) tell
the story of how Peace Corpsmen
were expelled from the village of
VIcos by a vote of its Indian inhabi-
tants. and how some of the Volun-
teers were then speciﬁcally asked to
return to the village.

Also related is the story of the

community of Chijnuya where one
Volunteer successfully transplanted
ill’l entire Indian community whose
homes had been lost to floods.

Peace Corps Institutes Changes

Research such as the Cornell/
Peru report is not an exercise
in vanity as far as the Peace Corps
is concerned. Frank Mankiewicz.
Latin American regional director of
the Corps. said the Cornell team's
observations and recommendations
resulted in immediate changes in the
Peace Corps‘ operations in Latin
America even before their ﬁnal re-
port was completed.

  

As the training programs become
less academic, colleges and universi-
ties are cooperating enthusiastically
in providing the kind of preparation
the Peace Corps needs. Pagano said.
"To do this we are using off-campus
fiicilitics related to expected country
experience." Dartmouth training
programs for French-speaking Af-
rica. for example, now go on to
Quebec for practical ﬁeld experi-
ence.“ (See story on Junior Year
Program. page 2.)

As might be expected, this tran-
sition in training procedures also
has jumped the cost of Peace Corps
training from $2,400 per Volunteer
to $2.700. Pagano said, but he be-
lieves the results will be’ worth it.

Measure PC Effect?

Preliminary reports led to a mark-
ed increase in language training. im-
proved relations between the Vol-
unteers and Peruvian institutions
with which they worked. and modi-
fications of the Peace Corps' train-
ing and overseas operations.

Coniritunlty Development Pioneers

Mankicwicz, who describes the
study as a "landmark" in community
development research. points out
that the 50 Volunteers who were
the principal subjects of the study
were among the ﬁrst Peace Corps
community development workers.
"'l'hcy operated almost without prec-
edent or textbook in a difﬁcult cul-
ture among people to whom cvcn
Spunish was an acquired lunguugc.

"That they did so well is rcmnrk-
able; but. as importantly, we have
been able to beneﬁt from their mis-
takes.“

Mankicwicz said he believes one
of the most important contributions
Pcucc Corps Volunteers such as the
Peruvian group make is their role
as “witnesses to the condition of the
poor among whom they live.
prompting the community at large to
plt)’ attention to the needs of the
poor."

sions of the Cornell report:
