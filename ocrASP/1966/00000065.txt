Comm unity De ve/opment: its Name Ma yBe Mud

By Willhm Krohlsy
Recife, Brazil

Sooner or later someone is certain
to puzzle out Informal deﬁnition
of urban community development.
Out of his garret and into the sun
he'll come handying his sheet of
convoluted prose only to be greeted

- with a recent erasure In Webster‘s

New Collegiate. Exactlywhn he'll
find where urban community devel-
opment once stood is hard to say —
perhaps something like “better burg
breeding" or “coached community
commotion" or any one of a thou-
sand possible locutions which would
shed an aura of respectability on an
undertaking whose very nature sug-
sleight-of-hand
presence.

in short, to‘deﬁne I phrase which
expresses the workings of an idea
in the hands of hundreds or per-
haps thousands of people is to lg-
nore one'of its most salient features
—mysterious happenings — and

Brasilia Tsimosa is I barrio of
Recife in the northeast of Brazil
with a population of about 10.000.

One of its perennial problems is
the ruin of its roads during the
four-month rainy season. During
this. period from May is August
the rain becomes a way or life, often
falling continuously for several days.
Fishing becomes sporadic. and all
but indoor workers are forced to
sit and do little but watch the steady
downpour turn the sand and dirt
roads into rivers of mud which set-
tie in
into black muck by traffic.

.lim Lail (Lexington, Ky.) and I
talked with many of the local
citizens about the roads and found
a real desire to get something done.
Several informal meetings were held

to discuss the problem, and it was .

decided to see what a group of
residents could do working in con-
junction with the city government.
The people were willing to perform
necessary labor if the government
would supply the equipment needed.

The planning took shout six
weeks, and what started as a small
group of 10 men turned into a
nebulous affair involving suddenly

First: drain the mud before the
arrival of the bulldozer. There was
one family which had a front yard
large enough to dig a drainage pit
in. The dona do casa (woman of
the house) thought it would be all
right.

The hole was dug along with a
trench to the mud: the trench was

There were. of course, a number

maybe we could borrow a bulldozer

and thus the logic of urban—com-

The project proceeded and was

AFRICAN PROBLEM: THE GENERALIST

Undefined Person Meets An Undefined Project

By Louis Rapoport
Masingbe. Sierra Leone

During my childhood, the thought
occurred to me that i didn't know
how to do anything. But some-
how, my shoelaces always got tied.
my bed got made, and l survived
in this practical world.

Then i went to the uniVersity,
where I took subjects like Scandi-
navian literature, history of his-
torians, modern Slavic literature.
and philosophy of literature. '

When I joined the Peace Corps.
l was classiﬁed as a "generalist."
As a man who could do absolutely
nothing of a practical nature, 1 was
slightly amazed when i met my fel-
low trainees for the Peace Corps
"R.C.A." program in Sierra Leone
(I honestly thought that I would be
working with computers or televi-
sion sets before I learned the initials
meant “rural community action")—
carpenters, masons. geologists. un
architect—people you read about in
books. unreal people. people who
can (shudder) do things.

i tried to fake my way by drop-
ping words like "hammer," “cc-
mcnt," and "wrench." But somehow,
my clever plan failed, and I feared
and trembled on Selection Eve. But
I look like l'm a very sincere Friend

East and West, and it makes me

to bridge it with a smile and a

"Our original excitement and en-
thusiasm have been somewhat temp-
ered by a year here. We have come
to realize that change/comes so
slowly that progress, if it comes at
all. seems imperceptible. The eager-
ness is replaced by colder ways of
looking at the world. and the youth-
ful vigor and idealism become hard-
ened with a day-to-day job. We
can never again become the peo-
ple we were before we came to
Africa. But then, we would not
want to."

——Hayward Allen, University of Col-
orado, 1960, Ethiopia

"What we need is a philosophy ——
not of high adventure 3 la Conrad
or St. Exupery—but of dullness;
a philosophy which will satisfy our
craving for accomplishment and a
certain nobility while we are faced
with tedium, fatigue and the desire
to sit down and dream."

“i do not wish to imply that we
‘won them over'; indeed, i think
they won us over in the ﬁnal an-
alysis. it's just that the intransigence
of our preconceptions of ourselves
and others generally dissolved into
a kind of affectionate confusion."

—Davltl Schickele. Swasthrnore,

"This is probably the most beau-
tiful place on earth . . . But after
you've been here a while you find
something much more beautiful than
rice paddies and groves of rubber
trees . . . it is a very basic joy with
life that i wish I could take back
and inject into America."

ment program patted me on the
back (after feeding me) and told
me to go out and develop a chief-
dom. It's easy to see why i was
chosen for this mission: no one
really knows what community de-
velopment entails, and who is bet-
ter qualiﬁed for an undeﬁned proj-
ect than an undeﬁned person?

i packed my bags and moved to
.Masingbe. I town of about- 2300
people and headquarters of Kunike
Chiefdom. immediately after my
arrival, i went to the highest point
in the town to survey my new home:
the huts of mud, wattle, and bttr-
lsp; the fragrance of lilac. frangi-
pani, and purple-tassled flowers fill-
ing the heavy air — ah. sweet life.
While I was gone my house was
robbed.

In the weeks that followed I
worked hard. dropping new words
such as "co-operative," "social 'cen-
ter." “adult education," “dispensary.”
and so on. i even pretended to know
the Temne equivalents: kaw aparteh.
nreth no ltawol, karart ka na bakl,
nserit nim atui . . .

The number of projects .I have
going is ridiculous, and i would
have to he a Renaissance Man to
handle them all. But i have started
my way; and my ingenious word-
dropping scheme has convinced at
least some people that i am pos-
sessed of virtue, that i am a true
"generalist" (that is to say, generally
good in everything). And just as
my shoelacea got tied, my projects,
somehow, will he completed.
