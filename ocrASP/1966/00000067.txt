permit him to live at the same level

"as those with whom he will work.

Each Volunteer also gets a read-

month (before taxes) which is given
to him at the end of service.

CHANGING DIRECTIONS

Most Volunteers Alter Career Plans While Overseas

The Peace Corps has a “pro-
found effect" on the career choice
of Volunteers. says Robert Cal-
vert. director of the organization's
Career Information Service.

Studies of the first 5100 returned
Volunteers show that more than
half of them changed their voca-
tional plans while in the Peace
Corps. Two out of three of the
Volunteers who entered the Peace
Corps with no long-range vocational
goals decided on one while overseas,
according to the studies.

Particularly signiﬁcant. Calvert
says, hu be'en the shift toward inter-
national careers. Only 8% of the
5.000 Volunteers were interested in
long-range careers overseas when
they entered the Peace Corps. But

almost one-third had this aim when

they completed service, he says.
Statistically, the activities of the

5.000 returned Volunteers are

broken down this way:

I 39% have continued their educa-

tion.

I 15% work for the Federal. state

or local government.

I IS% teach either in the United

States or abroad.

I 8% work with a social service

agency (more than 100 returned

Volunteers are now taking part in

the Ofﬁce of Economic Opportun'

ity's War on Poverty; more than

l0% of these are serving as VISTA

Volunteers).

I II% are in business and industry.

either in this country or abroad.

The remaining 12% includes
many who are traveling before start-
ing their caleers. Some older re-
turned Volunteers have retired. A
number of the women surveyed have
married and forsaken career goals
for the role of housewife.

A separate study of more than
2,000 returned Volunteers indicates
that nearly one-third were interested
in teaching at all levels. The same
study shows that the number inter-
ested in careers in government had
doubled —- to 20% — since they
entered the Peace Corps.

More than 6,000 persons have
successfully completed service as
Peace Corps Volunteers. It is esti-
mated that at least $0,000 will have
completed service by I970.

 

PEACE CORPS A T A GLANCE

On January I. 1966. the Peace Corps comprised
more than l2,000 Volunteers. The total includes
more than [0,000 working in 46 nations of Africa.
Asia and Latin America and 2.000 training for

service overseas.

’\

I More than I00< colleges and universities are
training Peace Corps Volunteers.

I The largest concentration of Volunteers is in
Latin America — nearly 4,000.

I 41% of all Peace Corps Volunteers are women.

I There are 580 married couples serving in the
Peace Corps. Since the Peace Corps began there
have been 274 marriages involving Volunteers.

I 77 children, including one set of twins, have
been born to Peace Corps couples abroad.

97 Peace Corps Volunteers are between 50 and
60 years old, .100 are older than 60.

85% of all Volunteers have college degrees, and

6'/&% have graduate degrees.

I 0f nearly 5,000 Volunteers to complete two

years of service and return to the U. S., 39% are

continuing their education.
More than 60 colleges and universities have

established some 300 special scholarships and

fellowships for returning Volunteers.

About 55% of all Volunteers abroad are working
in education— primary, secondary. university,
physical. adult and vocational.

DRAFT: DEFERMENT
BUT NO EXEMPTIONS

Peace Corps service does not
fulﬁll military obligations. al-
though Volunteers are deferred.
during their term of service.

While service in the Peace
Corps has been determined by
the Selective Service System to
be in the national interest. a
Volunteer must obtain a defer-
ment from his local draft board
just as a student does. immed-
iater after accepting an invi-
tation to join the Peace Corps,
the prospective Volunteer will
receive forms to send to his
draft board.

A Peace Corps deferment does
not exempt a Volunteer from
future draft requirements. Nor
does it mean that he cannot
qualify for further dcfermcnts
after completion of service.

Members of armed forces re-
serve units must have com-
plcted their active duty before
applying to the Peace Corps.
Any remaining weekly drill or
summer camp obligations after
active duty are postponed while
a member of the reserve is
overseas.

o. m In the “alde-
at-l-la for Peace Car-pa service?

A. The basic qualiﬁcations are
brief: you must be an American citi-
zen, at least ll years old. without
dependents under 18, and available
for a two-year term of service. You
need not know a language. Most
people. for instance. don't know
Urdu. which we teach you if you're
headed for West Pakistan. The
standards are quite high. More than
l50.000 people have applied for the
Peace Corps and only about 18.000
have been sent abroad. ‘

New Christy Minstrels Performance
To Highlight State Fair Weekend

Two concerts by the New
Christy Minstrels. the
well-known folk group, will
highlight Campus Carnival
weekend. scheduled for
May 20-22.

The seven men and two women
who are the New Christy Minstrels
have brought their trained voices,
skilled musicianship. sense of fun,
comedy, and bouncy expansive beat
to all points of the globe.

They played at the White House In
1964 at the Invitation of President
Johnson. They “brought down the
house" at the San Remo Festival
and won the first and second prizes
there.

The New Christy Minstrels be-

Regularly Scheduled Programs

Honors Program Rules
.Set By Committee

VOL. LII, NO. 23',

Proposals setting guidelines for honors program at
the University were Passed Monday by the Undergrad-
uate Committee on Honors and Independent Study. Any
department establishing an honors program next Sep-
tember must conform to these rules.

Among the proposals now
in effect is one requiring
no specific minimum
grades as on admission re-
quirement in the junior
year.

However, an applicant’s grades
will be taken Into account, along
with such other evidence as the
letter of application or interview.
To continue in the program after
the junior year, a student must
meet standards 1 and 2 below; to
graduate with an honors diploma,
he must meet all the rest.

Requirements

1) An all-over grade average not
lower than 8.0 during the junior
and senior year.

2) A grade average within the
major field well above 3.0 during
the junior and senlor year?”

3) Satisfactory performance that
comprehenslve examlt xtlon at the
end of the senior year. ’

4) A senior thesis or comparable
project approved by the depart-
mental committee.

5) Recommendation for the de-
gree with honors submitted by a
departmental committee of at least
three members.

Initiating Honors

Departments wishing to initiate
an honors program were given the
following principles to guide them:

1) Departments have the power
to walve all special requirements.
such as pro—requisites for honor
students;

2) Departments have the power
to determine the number of credit
hours to be given for Independent
work.

3) Departments have the power
to waive all courses required of an
honors students in the major and
second field during the junior and
senior year.

4) Departments offering honors
programs may establish honors
seminars on a departmental or In-
let‘dlscipllnary basis.

Committee Members

Dr. Morris Berger was chairman
of the committee with Dr. Jack
Deerlnger, Dr. Robert Donovan, Dr.
Alfred Flnklesteln, Dr. Arnold Fos-
ter, Dr. Alice Hastings, Dr. Curtis
Hemenway, Dr. Frank Kolmin, Dr.
Audrey Kouvel, Dr. David Martin,
Dr. Robert Morris, Dr. Hans Pohl-
sander, Dr. Paul Schaefer and Dr.
Clifton Thorne as the other mem-
bers.

Dr. Berger, of the Education De-
partment, expressed the belief that
one needs more than just good grades
to graduate with honors. He also
stated that the standardization ofthe
honors programs would assure that
no department had an easier pro-
gram than the others.

Dr. Berger also hopes the new
proposals “will be the impetus for
the starting of new programs."

‘Eye’ Presents
Polish War Film

A Polish film entitled “Kanal”
to Polish and translated as “Sew-
ers," will be presented at the Gol-
den Eye tonight. The film, directed
by Andrzel Wajda, is described as
a "grisly film portrayal of the war
ls hell theme."

Although the film was produced
in 1956 and won the Grand Prix at
Cannes In that year, it was not
shown much in America because its
commercial value was judged too
low to be worth showing to Ameri-
can audiences.

There wtll be Polish dialogues
but English subtitles are provided.
There will be a 25¢ admission
charge.
