presented by the French Department Tuesday night in Draper

Christy

For the first time in the Festi-
val's history, the Minstrels became
one of the few performers ever to
be asked to perform two numbers.

Both of their songs were the fes-
tival winners, and the New Christy
Minstrels became the first Ameri-
can artists to ever win.

The Minstrels’ renditions of “Se
Piangi, Se Ridi” (If You Cry, You
Laugh) and "Le Colline Sono in
Flore” (The Hills Are FullofFlow-
ers) finished first and second, and
within four days became the num-
ber one hits throughout Italy.

Reach Top ol Hit Parade

This was also the first time that
American artists have reached the
top of the Italian hit parade,

The New Christy Minstrels were
organized in 1061 and have patterned
their own contemporary singing
style after a company of pre-Civil‘
\Var entertainers created by Edwin
"Pops" Christy.

The original group traveled
through the country with cornball
Jokes, slapstick and folk songs and
are credited with introducing
Stephen Foster’s greatest songs.

Gain Experience
As the New Cllrlsty Minstrels
gained experience, they stl'onlll-
lined their act and perfected their
original style.

The ,Minstrels perform "ell
masse," and each individual of the
group has his or her own specially
which call be periornied us it solo.

They accompany illelllsolres on
banjos, guitars and bass, and its

Minstrels Concerts...‘

con/inner] [mm [mgr 1
“Variety” put it: “the wide assort-
ment of instruments and voices give
it (the group) all a full-blown force
with a captivating drive."

Any replacements needed are
made after grueling hours of audi-
tioning hundreds of young hopefuls
until that performeris found who
will harmonize, blend and add to
the group in all ways.

Neither a good voice, a hand-
some face, nor an instrumental
talent or pleasing personality are
in themselves enough to make a
Minstrel.

Tickets
Tickets for the concert are being
sold in the Peristyles from 9:00
a.ln. to 2:00 pm. at $3.00 for non-
Student Association members and
50¢ donations are being asked from
SA members.

vening of the New York state Inter-
collegiate Logi'slative Assembly
May 5, 6 and "i. Sponsored‘this year
by SUNY at Albany with Harriet
Tucker, president of Debate Coun-
cil, the assembly proved itself to

be a worthwhile and fascinating ex- q
.-porlnece

for those' politically
oriented participants.
Political maneuvering was more
evident than in the past years be-
cause a two party system, the Amer-
ican and National Parties, was ini-
tiated in the hope of destroying the
school blocs which had been de-
_veloped at previous assemblies.

Not Entirely Succeulul
The system was not entirely suc-

' , cessful since many of the old hands

continued to use blocs to achieve
their ends. During the nominating
assembly the bloc advocates were
out in force, with party members
disregarding their affiliations and
voting by schools despite the rous-
ing rhetoric of the party whips.

Speaking of rhetoric, it is un-
fortunate that the nominating
speeches were not recorded. At
first rather staid, boring, and nor-
‘mal, they proceeded to become ris-
quely ambiguous, scintillating, and
debatable as far as veracity is
concerned.

A nominee could be sure of elec-
tion if he revealed the fact that he
had a 2.2 cum, that being the much
vaunted status symbol of the evening.
Machiavellian-type machinations
were employed at all-night caucuses
in order to line up votes for the

v Delegates from 23 New York State
Colleges assembled at the recon-

b' Lorraine Balan
bill which was pending.

The results of these strategems
were seen as the (our committees,
divorce, family planning, narcotics,
and air and water pollution, con-
vened on Friday morning. The ma-
jority bills that came out of these
committees maintained the status

no.

The minority bills were not rad-
ical, but interesting stimulants for
debate, and controversy; they pre-
sented changes too extreme for the
conservative majority. Partisans of
the minority bills, which included
plans for sweeping alterations inthe
rehabilitation of drug addicts, legal-
ization of abortion,'and the addition
of artificial insemination withoutthe

. husband's consent to be included as

grounds for divorce, forlnedathird,
coalitio‘n party Friday evening.

Passage Fought ,

They decided to fight for the
passage of their bills, and each
member of the new party pledged
to support the other. Saturday
dawned, and the assembly began--
late. Activity on the floor was fre-
netic with delegates trying to elicit
last minute support from the fence-
sitters.

As an aside to all future assem-
blymen: Know your parliamentary
procedure. Those who were cog-
nizant of all its sneaky, practical
exegeses could prolong or prevent
'debate on crucial issues, introduce
amendments which shouldn’t be in-
troduced, fluster their opponent,
and otherwise disrupt the conven-
tion.

all the devioushess, prevarication

to mention irretrievable slumber.
Passed were acts to provide: for

Other Acts

bill legalizing abortion failed to ac-
quire the needed majority, although
ironically enough it received the

'award for best bill); for controls

on air and water pollution, and fl.
nally a bill commending the divorce
bill passed recently in the legis-
iature.

The air and water pollution hill
included provision for controlling
pollution caused by everything lllll
cigarette smoke, so to remedy this
oversight the honorable delegate
from R.l.T. proposed an ainelld-.
ment which stated that all cigar-
ettes lnust have after-burners.

It was defeated on the grounds
that if passed it would make :1
mockery of the assembly. The hon-
orable delegate retorted that the
ominous bill did likewise. With an
outburst of oratory against anlotion
to censor, the assembly concluded,
and the ligllts dilnlned on tomorrow’s
legislators.

The movie will be shown by IFG tonight at 7:00 p.m. and 9:15 pm. in Draper 349.

Council for Contemporary Music Formed

The Council for Contemporary
Music was recently formed by a
group of students, led by James
Kahn, Gerald Rice, and John Bran-
cato, who desired more popular
musical concerts at the University.

Tile Council was not forlned ill
opposition to Music Council, but
rather to supplement Music Coun-
cil in bringing the more popular
fields of music to campus.

Letters have been sent to the
agents of thirty popularentertalners
ill the fields of rock, i'olk, jazz and
pop music.

The immediate aim of the Coun-
cil for Contemporary Music is to
have three concerts, with repre-
sentatives of these three fields of
music, ill the l000-100’7 school.

The members of the Council feel
that the students of the University
deserve, at the minimum, as inucll
as Union and ll.l’.l. students, alld

they intend to see that students get
what they want and deserve.
Tickets to all concerts held by
the Council will be onlsale solely
tg students and staff for two days
so that the students get to see tlle

concerts.

The members of the Council for
Contemporary Music are "trying
to do a good job alld hope that they
will have the support of the student
body.”

’* interim. l

Various methods of registering
students were discussed at a press
conference with Dr. Clifton Thorne,
vice president of Student Affairs,
since President ' Collins was not
available on Monday.

Dr. Thorne said that having the
department heads or representa-
tives ili one area to sign up students
for courses had already been tried.

The disadvantages of the computer
system are also apparent.’l‘heprob-
lem is to have the computer’s effi-
ciency but still treat students as ill-
dividuais.

There would be two major goals
iii planning computer programming.
The first is to eliminate the lines
and the second would be to find an
equitable way to provide for indi-
vidual needs.

Committee Formed

A committee is being formed to
explore the different aspects of lllis
alld other interim methods of reg-
istration. A system of preferences
will have to be devised since all
students cannot be accommodated
ill all ways at one time. Different
groups such as seniors could not
be definitely given first choice in
card-pulling or advisement because
each group presents its own indi-
vidual problems which must be coli-
sia‘ered.

Dr. Thorne volunteered his own
personal reaction to last week's

.lines. lie said, "There is no ques-

 
 
  
 

tion. T l V, I

pointed out, however, mottllo ,
here are still not  at
some institutions. Also mdny f‘thor

lines here have been eliminated. . '

  

Dr. Thorne cited bill-paying loan
example. i ‘
My System Dllcuuod ‘

Another topic discussed at the
conference was the key system pro-
posal. Dr. Tharne said that he was
contacted formally for the ' first
time last week when students repre-
senting the proposal met with him.
He said that he was in favor of
further liberalization of hours, but
he didn’t like the use of keys.

students, however, need security
at nlgllt. They should not have to
sleep at night with the doors of the
dorm open either. The plan that
Dr. Thorne suggested instead of the
use of keys was that of having a
security guard on each quad avail-
able to open the doors of the dorms
as girls came in throughout the
night.

Final Approval

in order for the proposal to re-
ceive filial approval for use it must
be passed by the University Coun-
cil for the University. Before reach-
ing this body it will leave any stu-
dent groups iu which it is discussed .
and move to the Student Affairs
Council.
