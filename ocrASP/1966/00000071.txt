Does the University have the obligation or responsi-
bility to see to the physical fitness of its'enrollees?

This, to me, poses an inforesting question. I am
calling for nothing in the way of phys. ed. changes
here at State, optimistically believing that the future
will cure all. ' ‘

Personally I think .it's useless. bordering, occas-
ionally, on the inane. Why does a school feel it must
see to the physicalfitness _of its students? The most
readily given and shallow answer is that it is because
of a mandate of the State University system, that’s why.
But surely if the schools decided individually and acted
collectively to do so, phys. ed. could be abolished as a
requirement for all State U. pupils.

No. somewhere along the line, someone has decreed
that 60 minutes of stimulating exercise twice a week
(well, bowling is supposedly wonderful for the waistline)
is GOOD for us. And certainly we can’t object to any-
thing that is good for us.

Now take Spud’s Duds for instance—you remember,
the guys who didn’t quite measure up to the Univer—
sity’s standards of physical excellence during the
summer planning conference testing program. This
was benignly abandoned after a one year run.

Those poor guys were literally tortured an hour at
a time, twice a week, in various and sundry forms--
and for what? Add to their life’s longevity? Inspire
them to continue on and keep themselves in condition?
Or perhaps to forsake their lives of complacency and
indifference for a more ambitious and energetic ex—
istence? Oh come now!

in all fairness to Spud and the athletic department
we must admit that the job they did was in all proba-
bility most acceptable within the expectations of the
higher-ups. But we again must reiterate our stand
that it should not be up to the University to make these
people condition themselves.

Make.phys. ed. an elective and count the‘acquired
credit toward the person’s accumulative average. Or
just supply the facilities and necessary arrangements
and let the students decide for themselves if or how
they will condition themselves.

But required phys. ed. — whose one semester credit
can keep someone off the Dean’s List and yet is not
counted in the person’s final average — serves no
other purpose than to force students into engaging in
unwanted and undesired activities.

It’s time the University realizes that its goal of
producing the well—rounded person should not include
forced and enforced physical education.

‘ ’  Mike Connelly,

Albany State’s Diamondmen stranded a total of twenty-nine baserunners this past

week, losing a heartbreaker

The Danesmen, who have yet to win

for an away contest and to
men by injuries and sore
about his team’s chances.

The Great Danes have
been hurting all season for
players, and injuries to
Bill Ingino and Frank Kan-
kolenski this past week
have further hurt the team.

Lefty Tom Piotrowski gave up
only seven hits to Utica but they
were used to score but four runs off
the Sophomores pitcher. State bowed
them for its seventh loss of ‘the
season.

The Dane’s offense managed to
leave fourteen men on base in this
contest, helped along by five hits,
nine walks, and some tight Utica
fielding, which committed only one
error.

Ray Cianfrini drove in State’s
only run in the seventh as scoring
threats in almost every inning
fizzled out. Andy Christian helped
the cause, chipping in with two of
the five hits.

One Hitter

Tom Egelston pitchedaone-hitter
for five innings against RPI's En-
gineers, trying to make a 2-0 State
lead stand up. In the sixth inning,
RPI put two hits, a walk and an
error together to tie the score.
State came back with three runs in
the seventh frame, but the Engineers
scored six runs in their half of the
frame, five of them unearned, to
take the lead.

Piotrowski came in for Egelsion
in the eighth and finished up, but
the Danesmen, who have yet to beat
RP! under Coach Burlingame, could
not wipe out the lead.

Two Hits
Pep Pizzillo, Andy Christian, Dom
Martino, and Jay Moore had two hits

but the lack of scoring punch with
men on cost the team victory.

flares Beat New Paltz
Journey in liPl

Albany State’s Great Dane golf
team won their second match of the
season Wednesday, when they
downed New Paltz, 7-2, in a home
match at Pinehaven Country Club.

Number one man Bill Kane, who
defeated his opponent 0-5, was med-
alist with a par '71. A bogey on the
last hole cost Kane asub-par round.
Second man Fred Nelson shot an 84
and lost a heartbreaker, 2-1.

Mike Bloom, playing third man
for the first time shot a very fine
76 to outdistance his rival, 6-5.13ill

Pendergast, playing in the fourth
position won 3-2 while shooting an
87.

Fifth man Ray McCloat shot a
respectiable 84 and downed his op-
ponent, 6-5. Sixth man Dave Ellen-
bogen shot a 92 and was defeated by
the score of 5-4.

The linksmen are now 2-4 on
the year and travel to Utica College
yesterday for their seventh match
of the season. Albany's next match
is Monday against the Engineers of
RF! in an away contest.

'Congress and Vietnam’

delivered
Sunday.
p.m.

Senator Morse, the most out-
spoken Congressional critic of Ad-
ministration policy in Vietnam, has
been in the news a great deal re-
cently as a result of his participa-
tion in the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee's hearings on Vietnam.

He recently stated, "...in my
judgment the President of the Uni-
ted States is already losing the
people of this country by the mil-
lions in connection with this war."

Public Opinion Will Turn

Morse, in the past few months,
has consistently maintained that "as
the people get the fects"publil: opin-
ion will turn against administration
policy,

"The grass roots are aflarne,"
he argues. “i received 20,000 letters
a week before and during the debate,
and 97 percent of them supported
my position.”

On several occasions, the Demo-
cratic senator has stated: ”. am
perfectly willing to face the ballot
box on the Vietnam issue. I am
perfectly willing to be judged by
my people.”

Longtime Critic

As far back as September 1963,
Morse has vehemently opposed
American actions in Vietnam. in
May of last year, he commented,
“it is making enemies and frightened
neutrals out of people who once re-
spected us."

After the lecture, there will be a
question and answer period, which

dent of forum, and coordinator of

ture; it will be open to the public, '
