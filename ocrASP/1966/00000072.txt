attracted to the University. This is es-
pecially true because of the new vice—
president, Earl Droessler. who has made
contacts with many people in many fields.

These new people will greatly enhance
the faculty of the various departments.

Also, the University could become the
recipient of more grants, fellowships.
etc. for research by its members, which
could also lead to bigger and better fa-
cilities.‘

We welcome this new addition to the
University’s role.

The appointment of a new vice—presi—
dent for research at the University is a
sign of the new outlook for SUNYA. We
will no longer be an institution engaged
solely in the process of educating its
students in the classrooms.

Students will now be exposed to schol-
ars from all fields during research for
the sake of learning (something that will
be new to some people).

With this increased emphasis on re-
search more prestigious people will be

Naming of New Academic Buildings

see is the naming of the academic build-
ings. As you can see from the diagrams
below each. building is identified by the
subject matter to be taught there.

If the Administration is interested in
personalizing the new campus, as‘they
say they are. we would like to see them
start with the academic buildings by
assigning them names.

With the opening of the new academic
buildings next September and the moving
of the University to the newlcampus,
there has been much discussion about the
impersonal nature of 'the new campus.

The Administration has tried to dispel
these feelings by adding personal touches
to the buildings.

One of these touches we would like to

i'COMMUNICA TIONS

Sorority Disillusioneci

To the Editor:

As students at the State Univer-
sity of New York at Albany, we have
always thought of the annual Tulip
Queen contest as a wholesome and
well respected city event, and we
have always been eager to partici-
pate and give our support. We real-
ize now that it is just part of the
famed political workings of Albany.

This year we were proud to have
our sorority sister, Kathy Phalan,
selected as one of the eleven final-
lsts. Kathy spent a lot of time at
intervieWS and fittings and became
thoroughly eager and excited about
the contest. She was announced a
semi-finalist and then a finalist,
after which she attended a press
conference and a television inter-
view, and was given all of the offi-
cial information on the festival and
was presented with an official tulip
pin. After all of these events, after
having her hopes built up so high,
she was told that she was disqual-
ifiod.

The rules for the contest require
that the contestants reside in Al-
bany. Although Kathy's home is near
Buffalo, as a student she is con-
sidered a legal resident of Albany.
However, she was still found in-
eligible. She, like many girls who
attend school at Albany, had been
encouraged to participate in the
contest.

It is understandable that the com-
mittee feels that the Tulip Queen
should be an Albany resident. There-
fore, it was up to the committee to
screen all applicants before the
Interviews began, to eliminate the
risk of hurting a girl in the last
stages of the competition, as it
has been done. The committee ob-
viously did not do its job. Kathy’s
participation from the beginning in-
dlcules that it was overlooking the
rules. Wily, than, at the end of the
contest, did the committee decide
to follow the rule? There is no
reason why Kathy's feelings and
the committee’s dignity couldn't
have been saved by allowing her to
remain on the court. The correc-
tion should have been made next
year, from the beginning of the con-
test. The reason that the committee
was compelled to disqualify Kathy
they told her, was that they had rc-
colved many calls and complaints
from Albany citizens who objected
to her being it ﬁnalist. Does the

committee have any standard prin-
ciples of its own, or does it stoop
to obeying every call of publicopin-
ion? It is unforgivable that Kathy is
being punished for a mistake made
by the committee. Itis disappointing
to discover that the Tulip Queen
contest should be marred by such
an unjust incident and that the com-
mittee is merely a tool of politics.

The Council for Contemporary
Music, blanket permission for week-
ends and elections for Living Area
Affairs Commission were some of
the topics explored by Central Coun-
cil Thursday night.

After a lengthy discussion about
the Council for Contemporary Mu-
sic, the motion to appropriate funds
for this council was tabled. The
constitution for this newly organ-
ized council had previously been
approved by the Commission for
Community Programming.

Since the discussion centered
around the costs, which were not
available at the meeting, of popular
groups, it was decided that more
could be resolved after an idea of
costs had been obtained. Some of
the names mentioned by the council
were the Four Seasons, Bob Dylan,
Jay and the Americans, the Mitchell
Trio and Peter, Paul and Mary.

Council Requests $2275

The Council wanted $2275tobring _

two conerts during the year. One of
the arguments against the Council
was the fact that Special Events is
already planningto bringthree simi-
lar popular groups next year. No
need was seen by some members of
the Council for this additional money
to be appropriated for the same pur-
pose.

Another suggestion was made con-
cerning the funds for this new coun-
ci It was suggested that the council

Sophomores form

14 independents and 4 commuters.
The 4 class officers will also be
members of this council to be
chaired by the president ofthe class.

The 14 independents are Nancy

The four commuters are Ed Cun-
iff, Bob Noveu, Christine Root and
Tom Costello.

This council will make decisions
on weekends and activities planned
for next year,

The freshmen and sophomore
classes are sponsoring two events
the following two weeks: faculty re-
ception and an informal.

Tile reception will be held Sunday,
May 15 at 3:00 pm. in Brubacher
Lower Lounge. Over 500 faculty and
staff members have been invited to
the reception.

The Informal will take place Sat-
urday, May 21 at the Riviera in
Troy. Tickets will cost $2 a couple
which includes transportation.

  

start with a group which was not too
expensive, publicize it and attempt
to earn enough money to make a
profit to be used for a more well-
known group the second time.

In this way more popular groups
could be obtained in each follow-
ing presentation.

A decision concerning this coun-
cil will be made after more definite
costs are presented to the Central

Council. w n . I

for Sindenislxpeeted

The Director of Financial Aids,
Donald A. Whitlock, has announced
that students may expect a great
increase in work opportunities dur-
ing the coming summer and aca-
demic year as a result of expan-
sion in the College Work-Study Pro-
gram.

Over 200 full and part-time jobs
have opened for the summer, and
more than 400 for the coming aca-
demic year. This is a 50% increase
in CWSP positions over this year.

Primary Consideration

Students with the greatest need
for employment will be given pri-
lnary consideration. All those in-
terested in securing jobs are re-
quested to make appointments to
discuss their needs with Miss Mona
Norman, Employment and Loans
Officer, Stuyvesant Tower.

$115,000 in aid will be available
to students through the Educational
Opportunity Gram Program. This
new grant program will reduce the
borrowing level done by many stu-
dents; however, only half of the
program’s funds were appropriated
by Congress. As a result, grants to
University students will have to be
reduced accordingly. All applica-
lions are to be made to the Finan-
cial Aids office.

Parents Statement

All undergraduate students are
required to file a Parent’s Confl-
dentlal Financial Statement for as-
slstance requested for the coming
year. This is necessary to insure
that the University will be able to
adequately meet the needs of each
individual.

Tile National Defer ".6 Student Loan
Program, which the federal govern-
ment threatened to abolish earlier
fills year, has been restored to its
originally intended level of service,
190 million dollars for the nation.

While the University has not re-
ceived Its allocation of fundsio sup-
port this program, it Is assumed
that enough money will be provided
to meet the needs of University
students for the coming year.

Final Date June 15

All applications for financial as-
sistance must be filed with the Fi-
nancial Aids Office by Julie 15, 1966.
Students must file Parents Confi-
dential Financial Statements with
the College Scholarship Service,
Princeton, NJ.

Students filling loan applications
at the end of the summer may not
expect to have these requests pro-
cessed in time for fall semester
unless extenuating circumstances
have forced late filing.

Michael Ginsberg

at tile University, was elected pros-
ident of the state chapter of Phi
Botn Lambda at the stain convention
held April 22-23.

sional businessmen.

I art's Weekend
Delays” Action on New Music Group";

as they were~

unto gripes? res



Support for the proposal concern-
n‘ing women student's over-nights
was voted by the Central Council.
This would allow women to spend
weekends away ‘irom the dorms
without permission each time from
the parents.

Freshman would have to present
a statement from the parents at the
beginning of the semester stating
they could leave on weekends.

The rationale for this proposal
asserts that the university should
not have to act as an intermediary
In communication between student
and parents. The proposal would
allow more freedom of movement
as is found in the home. The plan
must formally be approved by the
University Council to be put in ef-
ect.

LAAC Elections

Elections will be held for the
vacant seats on Living Area Affairs
Commission. All the places were
not filled during the last election.
Nominations are open from the Dutch
Quad, the Alumni Quad and Com-
muiers.

Nomination forms are available
in Draper 10l, Student Activities
Desk in Bru, and Room 201 in
Stuyvesant Tower. Nominations
close Wednesday, May 18. Elec-
tions will be May 19 and 20 in the
Commons.

Central Council voted to become
a member of Associated Student
Governments. This organization,
composed of colleges and univer-
sites in the northeastern part of the
country, was organized to help
schools exchange information and
solutions on problems which they
may have in common.

Also, during the meeting, Wil-
liam Cleveland, president, an-
nounced the appointment of James
Ward as parliamentarian for the
1960-67 Central Council. Cleveland
explained that even though Ward will
be a graduate student next year, he
wishes to remain active in student
government.

Nicastd Electedti Head, "
To Define Goals, Purposes

Elections for the inter-Fraternity
Council were held Wednesday with
Joe Nicastri (Kappa Beta) elected
chairman, Vince Mauriello (Potter
Club) elected treasurer, and Doug
Hall (Kappa Beta)elected secretary.
Joseph Silvey, Assistant Director of
Student Activities, will act as ad-
visor for the Council.

Commenting on the new IFC, Ni-
castri said that “lFC has finally
realized that many of the non-ira-
ternal organizations on campus are
providing much of the same activi-
ties as would any fraternity, with-
out having to pay dues - and We in-
tend to do something about it.

“One of the main functions of
the fraternity system is to aid in
the University’s endeavor to mold
the competent individual. The aca-

demic University alone cannot sup-
ply an atmosphere for the develop-
ment of diverse skills, including
leadership and responsibility in a
democratic environment.

"The fraternity system has the
potential to provide and enhance such
basic needs. Our proposal is to de-
fine our goals and purposesinorder
to accommodate this objective."

Nicastri said that off-campus
housing for fraternities “would of
course help to induce infra-frater-
nity unity and spirit, but frat houses
aren't going to do ‘us one iota of
good unless we have a strong and
well-developed fraternal organiza-
tion.

"When we have this, only then,
1 think, fraternity houses could be
used to their proper advantage."
