.One'of the last things the average

moviegoer is likely to notice when '
' going to see a film is the way in

which the names cf.the stars are
arranged on‘ the theatre marquee--

' ‘which name is first, which has the

bigger letters; or in the newspaper

, radvertisementsnwhich name is in
‘the larger type, the bolder print.

The fact is, however, that the
question of billing is an important

' one in the.me business and is not

a thing to be taken lightly byvthe
studio involved in the making of a
feature film.

Top Billing

The question of who gets top billing
in a film not being an easy one,
billing squabbles can often become
quite entangled--they can lead to
costly delays, bitterness on the set
among principals; they can even re-
suit in the permanent shutdown of a

' film’s production.

A recent article in “Variety,”
the top show business newspaper,
illustrates the tenacity with which
stars truggle to attain top billing:
“Marlon Brando," the article
states, “has won a billing squabble
,with Sophia Loren in connection
with the tentatively titled "The
Countess’ ’ (the title is now “The
Countess from ilong Kong"), Uni-
versal film to bedlrected by Charles
Chaplin.

Resisting Agents
Miss Loren originally sought first

' billing alongside Brando, but thesp

(Brando) and his agents resisted
demand, the settlement was made
finally with Brando to receive first
star billing, Miss Loren second star
billing. Brando’s agents refused to
budge an inch and yield to the ac-
tress’ demands.”

The differences between first and
second star billings as shown on a
marquee is very slight. it means
merely that the. names Would read,
from left to right, “Marion Bran-
do and Sophia Loren.” Yet so im-
portant is this arrangement (the
billing stipulation is always speci-
fied in the actor’s contract) that a
reversal of the names, or the plac-
ing of the second-billed star on a
line higher than the first—billed,
could lead to a law suit against the
film company.

Improper Billing

Such was nearly the case when
Italian actress Sandra Milo com-
plained about the way her name was
improperly billed for “Juliet of the
Spirits.” To soothe Miss Milo the
Embassy Theatre in New York City,
which was exhibiting the film, was
compelled to adjust the marquee
accordingly.

Probably one of the most bizarre
billing battles was fought over the
1903 Twentieth Century-Fox spot -
taclc “Cleopatra.” As if the film
hadn’t had enough troubles during
its three tortured youis oi'pruduc-
tion, co-star Rex ilarrlsun further
complicated the mess with his own
squabble.

‘ The controversyra‘ged about a

 

huge billboard on, the Seventh Ave-
nue (back) side of the RiyoiiTheatre
in New York, an ad' display which
pictured Elizabeth Taylor as Cleo-
patra“ and Richard Burton as Marc
Antony lounging on a couch in the
midst of their heralded on-screen
lovemaking.

No Lettering

There was no lettering on the
board itself, but the ads gave Mis's
Taylor top billing on a line by her
self, followed by Mr. Harrison and
Mr. Burton on a lower line.

When Mr. Harrison realized that
the huge billboard showed only Miss

 5r V Eirf reiss-

that he should be. up there as well
by the simple factthat he was billed
to the left of (and therefore billed
above) Burton in the ads. Twentieth
Century-Fox pleaded with Harrison
to withdraw his demand, stating that
the insertion of his picture would
make the poster look rather absurd.
And indeed it would. for in the film
Antony was not to get "involved"

with the Egyptian queen until after .

Caesar’s assassination.
But Harrison insisted, and not
very long afterward, there was Cae-

sar standing over the two great ,

lovers on that billboard high above
Seventh Avenue.

Advanced Dramatic:

To Present Ploy:
In Richardson

The final set of one-act A. D.
plays will be presented on Wed-
nesday and Thursday evenings, May
25 and 26 at 7:30 p.m. in Richard-
son Studio Theatre. There will be
three plays directed by student di-
rectors Joyce Davis, Mary Temple
and Anne Digney.

The first play, “l’m Dreaming
But Am 1?” written by Luigi Pir-
andelio and directed by Joyce Davis
is a dramatic depiction of the fine
line between reality and illusion in
the style of Pirandello.

Stylistic Techniques

Miss Davis’ interpretation im-
plements stylistic techniques which
heighten the impressions of adream
world which might so easily be the
real one. The cast includes Christine
Smith, Charles Bartlett and William
Mayer.

“Manny” written by Walter Vail
and directed by Mary Temple por-
trays a man who, upon entering the
world of the stage, is forced to see
the events of his past life through
the very transparent mask of the
“actor.” As Manny assumes the
various roles to which the actor
subjects him, the pain of self-
awareness becomes pitifully real.
Manny is played by Alex Krakhower
and John Fotia plays the part of the
actor.

Anne Digney is directing Eugene
Ionesco’s play “The Bald Soprano.
Pure comedy rings true as the lives
of two suburban couples undergo
the devastating exposure of an un-
relentlessly probing theatre frame-
work.

Comic Exaggerotion

Through comic exaggeration
Ionesco depicts the absurdity of a
life filled with trite and meaningless
words which substitute for, rather
than express, the human thought
process. The cast includes Joyce
Levy, William Laundry, Carla
Smith, Robert Clayton, Carole Co-
senza and Al Smith.

There are no reserved‘seats; all
seats will be open to general ad-
mission.

Temporary Carillon

Playing Selections

An abbreviated version of the University's carillon
has recently been installed on top ofStuyvesant Tower
in the Dutch Quadrangle. it is to serve temporarily
until the complete version can be installed in its final
location in the carillon tower. During the trial period
officials are trying to discover the proper amplifica-

tion and programming.

The final decision for amplification and selections
rests with the Student Affairs Commission which is
now discussing the matter. Currently the chimes are
being played quite softly in deference to the men on

the 215i floor of the tower.

Unlimited Selections
Once completed, the Carillon will be able to play an
unlimited number of selections. Currently one one tape
with five selections is in use, but up to 50 tapes can

be used. The five selections now

“The Alma Mater," "Where are the Verdant Fresh-
men?” “Life Can Be Beautiful,”“HalielujahChorus,”

and "God, Our Help in Ages Past."

in addition there will be aprofessional carillonist
to play any selection next year on an instrument
similar to an organ. Col. Walter Tisdale, assistant
to the President says that the University has re-
ceived many complimentary calls from both campus,

residents, and the people Wing in
areas.

Gltt oi Alumnae

The chimes, which are well protected from the
weather, are a gift of the Alumnae. Col. Ttsdale

called them the "most spectacular

have ever donated." When complete, the carillon
will cost about $24,000. The date for installation is

the Alumnae day this June.
