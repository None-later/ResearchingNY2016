Mohawk Property

As the first project sponsored by
re-formed Inter-Fraternity Coun-
cil, last Saturday an all-Greek
cleanup crew descended on the MO-
hawk Property. Fifty fraternity men,
representing Alpha Pi Alpha, Kappa
Beta, Potter Club, Theta Xi Omega,
and Upsilon Phi Sigma, worked
throughout much of the morning and
afternoon.

When the job was finished those
who had any energy left began a
softball game. Several work gangs
set out clearning picnic areas, blaz—
ing trails, mowing lawns, and work-
ing in landfill areas in preparation
for this Sundy’sAll University Pic-
nic, sponsored by State Fair.

A lunch of hamburgers and soda
was provided by Student Activities
Office and gratefully devoured by
the fraternity brothers. The pulled
muscles and sun-burned backs tes-
tin to the work accomplished.

'I‘V‘Vatiety' of Topics. 

With Collins at Confer/onto“

Discussion at' the press confer-
ence with President Collins in-
cluded a variety of topics ranging
from the naming of the new aca-
demic buildings to the physical ed-
ucation requirement for a degree.

Collins said that the local board
of trustees for the University has
the power to name the buildings at
the new campus. Thus far, no de-
cision has been reached on the
names for the buildings.

He said that possibly by next
September the board will have de-
cided on the buildings’ names.

Physical Education

The question of who determines
the physical education requirement
for graduation was posed to the
President. He said that the decision
rests with the, individual unit since
the State Education Department
gives authorization for each insti-

tution to grant a degree with‘the
only stipulation being the number of
hours needed.

At present, there is a two year

physical education requirement-for

graduation; however, this has been

waived to only one year because of ,

the lack of facilities.

Lake at New Campus

The question was also raised at
the conference of whether or not the
lake at the new campus would be
operable for students. Collins said
that plans are being made with a
contractor to provide a beach area
and better lighting for pedestrian
paths. ‘

Course Guide

The idea of a course guide at the
University was also discussed. The
guide would include studentcritcism
of teachers and courses taught at
the University. Collins said that the
Administration would welcome such
a publication but felt it was worth-
less unless the job was done well.

Exam Schedule

The various methods at arriving
at an exam schedule were considered
by Collins. He said that at present
the schedule is based on the num-
ber of students per class. He said
that another method would beafixed
schedule. That is, the schedule would
be fixed at the beginning ofasemes-
ter when a student registers for
classes.

He said that he prefers the pro-
cedure we are using now but feels
that with the increasing number of
courses the fixed schedule will have
to be used.

Application Received

The President announced during
the conference that there has been
a 20 per cent increase In the num-
ber of applications for admissions
received by the University.

With this increase he feels that
the University will increase in total
enrollment 1000 students a year for
the next four years.
