_ next two ‘ months to help deter-
mine student deferments from the

, .draft.

A 15-member student-faculty

' group demanded that SUNYAB Pres-

ident Clifford C. Furnas either re-
fuse to provide university facilities
or' issue a disclaimer of university
support for the exam. From there
the scenario reads as follows:

Early last week President Furnas
told the group in a private session
that he would not do anything re-
garding the exam and would not speak
at a public meeting concerning the
issue. ‘

Began Sit-In

At this point the student-faculty
group, already burgeoning in spite
of the-fact that final examinations
begin at SUNYAB this week, began
their 44-hour sit-in outside of Pres-
ident Furnas’ office -- 20-70 stu-
dents were ln front of his door at
all times, although they did not ob-
struct entrance or exit.

In the middle of the sit-in the-
faculty executive committee of the
College of Arts and Sciences pro-
vided indirect support for the pro-
test (now named "The Movement")

Five Students Attend
Conference, Discuss
Education Problems

Five students from the University
attended the Tenth Annual Delegate
Assembly 'of 'the Student Education
Association of New York State, held
in Kingston, New York April 28-30.

The students representing the Un-
iversity were Patricia Wagner, Rob-
ert Gibson, Rita Schmilowitz, Gall
Fowler and Brenda Sweet.

The theme of the Aesembly was,
“From the Ivory Tower into Real-
ity” and included an address by the
Northeast Regional Director of the
Office of Economic Opportunity, Dr.
Samuel Proctor. In the speech, Dr.
Proctor urged teachers to leave
their ivory towers of ideals in ed-
ucation and work for realities.

The students attended workshops
on Various problems of education:
what role does the professor play
in setting teacher education stand-
ards; financial, political and pro-
fessional implications of't‘Opera-
tion Headstart;” role of classroom
teachers and the school board in
developing school policies, etc.

Two merit awards were given to
Miss Wagner and Gibson for the
time, effort, and work they put in
revising the nomination and elec-
tion procedures for state officers.

member  later. protested“ they
weren’t informed of the session) at
which they supported both the Arts
and Sciences'faculty and ‘f’l'heMov'e-
ment."  ’-’

The student senate also entered
the picture, again requesting the
president to attend a' public meet-
ing -- theirs. He sent two aids in-
stead, one of whom declared-that
the holding of the draft test was
“a closed matter."

“The Movement” "stood up" the
next morning, leaving the presi-
dent's office with a call for a public
forum that night, and again request-
ing President Furnas to appear.

 

Attracts I000 People

The forum attracted BOO-1,000
people. The president wasn’t among
them, but he did issue a statement
saying that the draft test was being
given as a service to students.

“The Movement" threwupapick-
at of 200-300 students in frontof the
administration building the next day,
calling for another mass meeting
that night.

Enter soc-1,000 people again, who
this time decide that the draft is‘not
as important an issue as 'the nature
of the decision-making process at
SUNYAB. The ad hoc group de-
clared: l) ultimate power to deter-
mine university policy should be
vested in the faculty senate; 2) the
student senate should have the right
to make proposals concerning the
campus which would take effect un-
less vetoed by a 2/3 vote of the
faculty senate; and 3) “Since co-
operation with the Selective Service
is generally regarded as a major
policy decision, we request that all
cooperation with Selective Service
be suspended until a policy is de-
termined as called for in our pro-
posal."

Moots With Students

This meeting occurred on Fri-
day night, but the weekend did not
bring peace. Instead, President Fur-
nas reversed a trip he had just de-
parted on, coming back to campus
to meet with representatives of the
faculty senate, student association
and' graduate student association.

This latest in the proliferation
of committees: 1) called for the
formation of a lo-lnember, faculty-
student-administration committee
to consider problems and make
proposals with respect to “opening
and maintaining apontinual dialo e

"The Movement" reconvened at
7 am. Monday to consider the latest
developments. After three hours of
debate ("all sorts of people accused

all sorts of other people of selling .

out," one observer explained), the
group agreed to end its protest if
the administration (again repre-
sented by aides as the president had
left for San Franciseo) agreed to:

l) the election of both faculty and
student members to the special com-
mittee set up over the weekend; and
2) the designation of all authority for
making a decision on the Selective
Service exam to the faculty senate
executive committee (whose chair-
man, unknown to the students, hap-
pens to be President Furnas).Pend-‘
ing an administration response,
"The Movement" set.up another
picket line.

Administration Capitulctee _
All ended happily on noon Monday
when the administration capitulated.
Students returned to the business of
final exams (which began the next
day) singing “We Shall Overcome."

For President Furnas, theulti
mate irony of SUNYAB’s sagaisthat
this was not only his last week ,of
classes for this term,th forever.
He will be retiring as oi‘thie slun-
mer. _
A number of schools have said
that they will not make a student’s
grades available to his draft board
unless they have the student’s per-
mission. Others have said they will
make the grades available unless
the student asks that they be with-
held.‘ .

 

Detrlmentol to Students

However, both university offi-
cials and Selective Service spokes-
men have said that it might be
detrimental to the student to have
his grades withheld. A Selective
Service spokesman in Washington
said that grades would be used as
“only one indication” of a stu-
dent’s eligibility for a deferment
and without the grades the local
board "will have less to go on."

The spokesman denied that local
board would draft students in re-
tailiation if they asked that their
grades be withheld.

The Selective Service office also
announced last week that a student
taking the draft test will not have
to be flngerprinted if he doesn’t
want to be.

The announcement said that other
positive identification would be ac-
cepted to prove the student's iden-
tity, but it did no give examples.

A spokesman for the Selective
Service said the change in policy

was. due to l'num'erous complaints

Meanwhile, delegates to the first
National Service Conference'in New
York suggested that youths be al.
lowed the option of service in the
anti-poverty: program or in the
Peace Corps‘ as an alternative to
being drafted.

iii-Page auditorium. A limited number of tickets are
still available and will be sold at the door.

The Fair will be held from 1:00 to 4:00 p.m. on Sat-
urday, and in the event of rain will move to the down-
stairs of Brilbmher . Many of the University’s organ-
ization will sponsor a variety of carnival and food

THE NEW CHRISTY MINSTRELS will provide entertainment tonight in two perlormances at Page
Hall. Their concert will olliciolly open the first Campus Carnival Weekend.

Expansion of State Fair Involves

'   Variety of Events Planned'forcarnivai

    

SISTERS 0F CHI SIGMA THETA observe the ellects of their
contribution to Campus Carnival Weekend. Their mock prison
will be one of nearly thirty books at Saturday's State Fair.

Fair Booths Reflect
Carnival Atmosphere

A collage of colorful booths and circus activities will transform the
parking lot area of the Dutch Quadrangle into a carnival setting as the
annual State Fair opens on Saturday, May 21, at l:00 p.m. Approximately
thirty organizations will sponsor booths, encompassing themes ranging
from a mouse race at the Kappa Beta booth to a raffle for a stuffed ani-
mal dressed with money planned by Commuters' Club. The stands will be
built on Saturdav morning. when the Fair area traditionally comes alive
with the sound of hammering and last-minute preparation as the my-:
rlad Structures take Shape. Four dormitories have submitted plans for
Saturday's event. Aiden Hall will sponsor a dime- throwmg game
with cl arettes as 'a prize.

VB eeker Hall members will

add a touch of myst'lt'iue nwith a
fortune-telling booth, voodoo doll
sale, and raffle for a basket of
mystery foods. Johnson Hall offers
winners of a dart game a chance to
smear the face of some well-known
campus personality with whipped
cream. Morris Hall residents will
sell fortune candy.

Greeks Contribute

The Greeks will be well-repre-
sented at the Fair, with every sor-
ority and fraternity sponsoring a
booth. Sigma Lambda Sigma is sac-
rificing its brothers to a damp af-
ternoon by offering a chance to hurl
softballs at water buckets poised
over the heads of its volunteers.
Chi Sigma Theta’s contribution will
be a “jail,” with sisters making
arbitrary arrests and requiring
prisoners to pay a fine for their
release.

Phi Delta and Beta Zeta are
sponsoring slave auctions; the high-
est bidder at the Phi Deit booth rc-
ceives the services of a sister for
the afternoon, while visitors at BZ
can win the favors ofa member of
that sorority by puncturing num-
bered balloons which correspond to

“With the expansion of the Uni-
versity, we felt that our program
must be enlarged to keep pace."
Mr. Edward Greismer of the Stu-
dent Activities Office thus explained
one of the reasons for the expansion
of the annual State Fairintoathree-
day weekend.

The change in the concept of the
Fair was initiated also “to provide
and combine a time period and a
variety of'activlties which can in-
volve many people from the Uni-
versity.”

Many usually unrelated factors of
the University indeed already have
had a part in making the weekend
possible. Faculty members are
serving on committees to select the
three best booths at Saturday's Fair,
and are working with student repre-
sentatives on a committee to select
the foreign student who will receive
the scholarship provided by the
carnival's earnings.

Special Events Board is respon-
sible for obtaining the services of
the New Christy Minstrels on Fri-
day night.

Music Council has offered its co-
operation by overseeing ticket sales
 technical eui ment for the
Weill. The audio-v suai department
has assisted by sending staff mem-
bers to assure proper operation of
sound equipment during the per-
formance. ' -

Perhaps because of the large num-
ber of campus groups who have
played a part in the Carnivals or-
ganization, Mr. Greismer has found

since February.

tin-chairmen Set
Goal of $2000

Madeline Stein and Michael Gins-
burg, co-chairmen of State Fair and
key figures in its expansion this
year, have announced a goal of
$2,000 to be earned by the week-
end's events.

The amount, which is double that
which has been set for other years.
will be used to provide a scholar-
ship for a foreign student to study
at the University for one year.

Mady and Mike were appointed to
organize the weekend by Special
Events Board, to which they appliedj
for the position.

Plans for the carnival began just
after intercession, and have involved”
a wealth of meetings, details and
arrangements.

Mady and Mike are also repre-
sented on arcommlttee to select the
foreign student who will receive
the scholarship. alpervlsed by Miss
Helen Moye of the department, the
committee is responsible for view-
ing the applications and qualifica-
tions of those eligible for the grant.

The co-chairmen have extended
their thanks to 059 who have
worked on the p cnic, booths, fair
and concert. .

Mike commented that “we'd like

especially to thank Joseph Benedict,
a student intern in Waterbury Hall-
who worked closely with us,
