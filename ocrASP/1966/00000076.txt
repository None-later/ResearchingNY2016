"larger Auditorium Needed

Over 950 people will attend the Wayne
Morse lecture this Sunday. This is an
example of the interest that can be
generated by a speaker of Morse’s
stature.

In the future several organizations
on campus plan to bring to campus
many prominent men. However, with
the inadequate facilities planned for the
new campus, only a small number of
people will be able to take advantage of
these programs.

The reason for this is that the largest
auditorium that can be used is a lecture
hall that will house only 500 people.

The explanation that we have been given
for-this small hall is that the Albany
Fathers told the University that the city

In Search of a Function

“What is MYSKANIA?” was a ques-
tion posed to several students recently
by a_“New York Times” reporter who
was interviewing students on campus.

The answer he was given was that
MYSKANIA is the highest non—academic
honorary on campus and is composed
-of students elected by the student body.
The reporter was also told of MYS-
KANIA’S long history and service to
the school.

Intrigued by this story he asked what
function MYSKANIA serves now. The
best answer that could be given was that
MYSKANIA was in search of a function.

This answer may have satisfied the
reporter but we feel that the student
body deserves a better justification. We

was planning to build a large auditorium
and that it would be unnecessary for the
University to construct a building of
comparable size.

The City Fathers have been building
this hall for the last two decades and
we think it was rather naive of the Ad-
ministration to believe this hollowprom—
lse.

It is probably too late for the con-
tractors to alter the plans for the lee-
ture hall. We would like to see the Ad—
ministration arrange fcr the use of a
larger hall for organizations to use.

We hope that in the future the Ad-
ministration will be more realistic and
plan for the future. not for the present.

\

are told that the role of MYSKANIA will
include investigations of various activi-
ties on campus and the pronouncement
of moral judgments when crises arise.

We agreed with MYSKANIA’s role as
an investigatory body but we find it
ridiculous for MYSKANIA tomake moral
judgments.

We do not feel that a group of students,
which is elected by a popular vote of
the student body, is qualified to pro-
nounce moral judgments. They are
elected on the basis of service to the
school, intelligence and popularity.

As the situation stands now, MYS~
KANIA has become an object of ridicule
by many students. If they do begin pro-
nouncing moral judgments their esteem
will be lowered even more.

by. Joe Nteostrlk

The Pan-Hellenic Council hasjust
had Its first meeting with Its newly-
elected members. In the past, the
representatives from Pan-Hell to
the Central Council would also func-‘
tlon as co-chairmen for the Greek
organizations, but Ruth Silverman
and Carl Dipple felt that up to six
meetings a week would be too much
work for any student and under-
standably 50.

Because of this, We decided that
the chairman of I.S.C. and I.F.C.
would also assume the role of co-
chairman of Pan-Hell. Pat Swilzer
(Chi Sig) will, along with myself,
act in this capacity.

Greek Board Proposed

Among the order of business
before Pan-llell, It was proposed
that a Greek Board be added to the
Living Area Affairs Commission,
tentatively to be composed of the
junior I.F.C. members from sor-
orities and fraternities. Hopefully
they will become an intrinsic part
of the student government and the
fraternal system.

Last Saturday, during the clean-
up project at the Mohawk Property,
I had the opportunity to speak to
Mr. Hollis Blodgett, who is co-
ordinating all activities for the
Property, about having a Pan-Hel-
lenic room at the house there.

He reacted to the suggestion fav-
orably, but did say that further dis-
cussion of the idea would be neces-
‘sary. The suggestion was that each
Greek organization submit a plaque
representing Its shield and colors,
to be placed on the walls of one of
the rooms. As for now, we’ll have
to wait for a next meeting before
any more information will be avail-
able. '

New Sorority

According to I.S.C. a new sor-
ority is now being considered. The
interested girls attended the last
I.S.C. meeting and were Invited to
a coffee hour afterwards. All in-
dications were that it seemed to be
a profitable experience for allthcse
who attended. Any Interested girls

should contact 'Mary Mencer In
Schuyler Hall. .

A good turn out is expected for
State Fair Weekend. Among others,
each sorority will have their own
booths containing some interesting
talent. The men will also have their
own booths: in a section set aside
for I.F.C., and share in all the fun
and games.

As for the“l.F.C. itself, the steer-
ing committee Is finally getting un-
derway. Most prominent in its order
of business for this year and next
will be a workshop to be held one
week before the beginning of the
Fall Semester.

Attending this meeting will be the
presidents, senior, junior and soph-
omore I.F.C. representatives from
each fraternity, along with Mr. Sll-
vey, and hopefully a few more ad-
ministrators and faculty advisers.

Workshop Purpose

The purpose of this workshop
will be primarily to construct a
completely new constitution for
I.F.C. Secondly, it hopes to devise
a strong set of rush rules and a
plan to set them in motion for the
following semester.

The importance of this workshop
is stressed and all those involved
are urged to attend. It will involve
a good deal of work and time, but it
should be as profitable for I.F.C. as
it will be_an experience for every-
one there.

UFS should be congratulated for
the work they are doing for the
Madison Avenue Presbyterian
Church. They are helping to reno-
vate a building for offices for the
United Council of Churches. Hank
Mueller, president, plans to send 8
to 10 UFS brothers every Saturday
to do more work.

Letter to Freshmen

I.F.C. intends to sent out a letter
to all incoming freshmen next year.
Itshould be In the mail by July 4.
The lettdr will include a short note
about the fraternity system and high-
lights in each of the fraternities.
» The name and address of one mem-
ber from each group for possible
correspondence will be included.

Public Apology

To the Editor:

I have found myself guilty of the
practice of "projection" in trans-
ferring the traditions ofacommuter
college to those of Albany State. A
series of recent confrontations have
enlightened me to my error.

At Fairleigh Dickinson University

In New Jersey, which had mainly
commuters and few dormitories, the
common practice was for males to
spontaneously strike up a conver-
sation with coeds in the Student
Union. This was the accepted prac-
tice. Introductions were the exoep-
lion rather than the rule.

I attended FDU from 1959 to 1963
and did a year of graduate work at
New York University, 1963-64. The
informality of approach at NYU,
also largely something of a com-
muter school, was very much the

same.

For the first several months last
autumn, I attempted this same ap-
proach at Albany State,’ since I
currently am at the Graduate Schoui
of Public Affairs here In Albany
where females are scarce. In the
majority of Instances, apparently,
directness was not appreciated.

Introductions, through a mutual
friend, seem to be the customary
rule-uf—thumb. As a result, the
"image" development of me as bold
and arrogant has taken place. With-
ing the dormitory set-up, bad news
travels fast.

To those who mistook my inten-
tions of seeking to meet newpeople,
as an educational as wellasapurely
social experience, I ask a re-eval-
nation. Not attending classes at
Albany State, It is rather difficult
to meet new people other than in the
Studlent Union. In bringingthe values
of my alma mater_ to the current
eiivlronment, perhaps I was dog-
matlcally clinging to the past.

Whomever I may have uninten-
tionally offended, to them I wish to

apologize. Censure Is a simple act,
but understanding goes a bit deeper.

Morse Ticket
Distribution Explained

To the editor:

It has come to my attention that
many students feel that they were
not given a fair chance to obtain
tickets for the Wayne Morse lec-
ture.

Many students criticized Forum
of Politics for selling tickets to the
general public when there was such
a great deman for tickets from the
student body.

Therefore, I feel obliged to explain
the difficult circumstances that Cen-
tral Council imposed upon Forum of
Politics.

Last week Forum, whose budget
was almost exhaused, went to Can-
tral Council and asked for an addi-
tional $200 appropriationp this
money was necessary to cover the
various costs of the lecture.

Central Council granted Forum's
request, but the Council stipulated
that Forum, through ticket sales,
had to return thlslmoney to student
government.

Thus Forum was forced Into the
ambivalent position of trying to
raise $200 through ticket sales and
at the same thne trying to to allow
as many students as possible to
obtain tickets for the lecture.

I felt that the fairest method of
handling this problem was to dis-
tribute 741 tickets free to students
(Page Hall seats 941) and to place
200 tickets on sale to the faculty
and to the general public.

It Is unfortunate that every stu-
dent who wanted to attend the lee-
ture was not able to get tickets,
but I honestly feel that Forum's
method of distributing tickets was
the best solution under the cir-
cumstances.

Albany Symphony to Expand

Music Education to Children

After the concert hall
becomes silent, one of the
most challenging contribu—
tions that our orchestra can
make to the community is
in its endeavors with mu—
sic education.

Children of all ages re—
spond to music, especially
when it is not presented as
a chore but as an integral
part of their every day ex—
istence.

Many Concerts
The Albany Symphony
Orchestra has been playing
concerts in the area
schools during the past

years, and the possibilities
are now being explorcd to
play more concerts, cov—
school

ering more area

children. as well as tiny
tots!

Ticket costs for students
who attend the regular con-
cert series have been kept
to a minimum and area
young people are invited to
attend the dress rehear—
sals.

Planning Committee

A survey of music pro—
grams in the elementary
and secondary schools of
the Capital District was
undertaken recently by the
Orchestra’s Planning
Committee.

Local music educators
felt that it would be a great
asset to our students if the
following programs were
available in the schools,

Significant Theatrical Billing

Presents Problems to Admen

by Douglas Rothgeb

The publicity departments of the
major studios'often are faced with
nearly insurmountable problems be-
cause of billing squabbles. On many
an occasion the very fate ofa film
may he decided (namely, whether It
gets made or not) by the work of
the ail-men.

Curtis-Lewis

A classic example of this sort of
thing is the case of Paramount Pic-
tures’ “Boeing-Boeing” starring
Tony Curtis and Jerry Lewis. Or
was it Jerry Lewis and Tony Curtis?

Unique Problem

The unique problem went to the
publicity department: how to give
the two stars first billing without
putting one person’s name In a
higher position on the posters and
In the news ads.

The final solution was an Ingen-
ious one, and it saved the studio :1
good deal of bickering and wasted
time and money.

No Problem

At first no real problems had
arisen in connection with the film,
which was to be adapted front the
smash hit Long play of the same
name.

No problems, that Is, until the
company began casting. The two
)erfecl stars for the picture, it
was agreed, were Lewis and Curtis
(or Curtis and Lewis), but a grave
problem arose, because neither was
willing to accept second billing to
the other.

Crossed Each Other
hi the ads the names of Jerry

Lewis and Tony Curtis crossed
each other, forming an “X” shape,
so that, although Mr. Lewis’ first
halite value below Mr. Curtis's,
Mr. Lewis' last name wound up

So In the end both stars were
satisfied and the film was made
and shown without further compli-
cations.

Not Always Static

Movie billings are not always
static. They can change and often
do. For Instance, a second or third-
billed performed at the originaldaie
of II film's release may a few years
later reach such prominence that
when the film Is re-Issued thatper-
former may be given top billing
over the stars who were orlglnally
billed over him. Two prime ex-
amples come to mind.

When the youngllayley Mills made
her debut In the English thriller
"Tiger Day" In 1959 she was third-
billed behind llorst Buchholz and
her father John Mills. However,
after she achieved stardom, “Tiger
Bay” was re-issued in 1961 and her
name was billed first.

Popular Acclaim

Julie Christie was likewisethlrd-
billed to Laurence Ilarvey and Dirk
Bogardc when the film was released
In England last year. But due to the
immense popular acclaim and the
winning nfthree major actingawards
her name shorin appeared first on
the marquees.

Lure Audiences

l-‘llin studios, at least the major
ones, can use billings deceptively
to lure audiences to expect what a
film will not give them. Sophia
Loren, for example, who is a box-
office favorite, got top billing in
"Operation Crossbow,” an exciting
World War II yarn. She was billed
above George Peppard and Trevor
Iloward, no slouches themselves.

Walk-0n

YetTvllss Loren’s part in the film
was little more than a walk-on.
She played a ten-minute scene with
Peppard, then was conveniently
murdered and never again seen In
the film. If she had been a minor
star or starlet, of course, her
name would have been buried in
the myriad of supporting players.

Smart Supporting

Probably the most fascinatingand
also least common (I know of but
one case) sidellght to the billing
question is the fact that billing can
even affect the awarding of acad-
emy awards. In 1954 Dorothy Malone
was originally star-billed inf‘ert-
ten on the Wind." However when the
time came for Academy nomina-
tions to be made, Miss Malone de-
cided to, and did, change tier billing
status to supporting actress. What-
ever the reason for her decision, it
resulted in her winningthe Academy
Award for Best Supporting Actress
in that year.

Money to Studio

The way the stars are billed up
there on the marquee, then, is any-
thing but insignificant to the film
Industry. Billing can cost a studio
money or make it some on the sly.
In a way it defines stardom and Is
a concrete symbol of the towering
ego structure of .the film world.
As long as there are stars there
will be movie billing, and when the
billing merry-go-round' stops, the
star system is surely dead.
