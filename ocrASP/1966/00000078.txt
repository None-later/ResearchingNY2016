lllw Pav Student lax

The [allowing is a guest editorial by the Stu-
dent Tax Committee.

When a student enters college, he
rarely expects to spend all of his four
years locked in the library or in a
classroom. On the contrary, most stu-
dents expect that the University will
provide‘him with the ability to further
‘his own social life and his own extra-
curricular activities.

Unless these activities are provided,
few people will find their college life
a satisfactory one. .

The State of New York supplies only
the bare necessities for an education -
classrooms, dormitories, andteachers.
The university community must provide
the other necessities of college life.

Since the students desire these neces-
sary activities, they must absorb the
cost of them. Student publications. sports
events, theatre productions, guest speak-

tontrol of Athletic Tax

The recent action by Central Council
to make the Athletic Advisory Board a
committee of Central Council is another
step toward involving students in de-
cisions in all matters which affect them.

For years the Athletic Advisory Board
has worked in the limbo ofsemi-secrecy
because of its separation from the major
portion of student government. This sep-
aration could not be rationalized. A. A.
Board handled over $150,000 last year
(including surplus), all of it student
money.

The new structure makes all financial

are, social clubs, etc. all require money
to carry on their operations effectively.

The Student Association was formedto
provide these activities andto promote
the formation of new groups which will
provide new, worthwhile activities. The
Student Association levies a student tax
each semester to finance the activities
and operations of student groups.

The Student Association depends on
each student to pay his student tax to
support these activities. Each student
will benefit from these activities only
if he pays this tax. Last semester the
student body showed its overwhelming
support for the present programs fi-
nanced by Student Association.

If the student body wishes to maintain
its support of these necessary activities
and maintain a worthwhile University
Community, each student must pay his
student tax.

matters subject to review by Central
Council. This procedure will allow the
student body to involve itself in the de-
cisions concerning how and were its
money will be spent. The previous sys—
tem of taxation without adequate repre—
sentation has been ended.

Dr. Thore, Vice-President for Stu-
dent Affairs, should be commended for
the encouragement and advice which he
gave to the Student Tax Committee and
for his assistance in drawing up the
legislation'making A. A. Board a com-
mittee of Central Council.

interfaith Center Needed

To the Editor:

in response to the “Open Letter"
in last Friday's ASP, I feel that
ideally religious facilities shouldbe
located on campus in the "main-
stream" of university life.

Sheer distance eliminates the use
of existing off-campus facilities.
The nearest Roman Catholic church,
for example, is just under two miles
from the Colonial Quadrangle. The
nearest temple is not much closer.
To get to these places of worship,
students would have to cross unpro-
tected busy highways. Winierweaili-
or would make walking even more
prohibitive. Clearly the use ofpres-
out facilities 15 not the answer to
the problem.

As a student 1 wish to worship
with other students and faculty in
the university community. This is
the situation which is most rele-
vsnl to me for 1 study, work and
play with these people six days a
week. Why should i on the seventh
day be "alienated" from the uni-
vorslty community incense i wish
to worship? Is this not In infringe-
ment on my constitutional right to

be free to practice my religion as
I wish?

I am well aware of the New York
State Constitutional prohibition on
the use of state property for relig-
ious services. 1 would suggest that
we students together with our par-
ants and faculty, both teaching and
administrative, join in petitioning
the up-coming State Constitutional
Convention for an amendment that
would permit the building at private
expense of religious facilities on the
State University campus.

Because such anamendmenttoilw
State Constitution is at best in tho
distant iuturo, I think that the rum
structlon of an interfaith Center
near the campus ls thobostremuln-
Int; alternative. Iiere students and
faculty would be able to worship
together no part of the university
connnunily. However, II In; lilllm—
iuuulc that it must in: physical];-
Bﬂparaia from the residence hulls
and academic complex. A religious

nomlnational', is a little “off con-
Wl‘" when it Is not an integral part

ToIIoIiove Tense Vietnam Situation

"We are not' going to maintain
peace in the world by exporting
American'military aid. We are going
to maintain peace by exporting breed -
and brains."

Senator Wayne Morse, outspoken
critic of the Johnson administration
foreign policy in Vietnam offered
this alternative to the war effort
in his speech Sunday night In Page
Hall.

Speaking before a large and highly
responsive audience, Senator Morse

expounded many aspects of “Amer-
ican Foreign Policy-4906."

No Agroomsnt

He prefaced his remarks by em-
phasizing that he did not expect
agreement with his views, but rattler
urged critical thinking as the basis
of public opinion.

Although he acknowled that he had
often opposed the policies and posi-
tions of President Johnson in regard
to foreign policy, he emphasized
the President’s competence and sin-
cerity.

“i do not question his sincerity
and his desire for peace," said
Morse. “i believe he has suffered
from many lapses of good judg-
ment....Those of us who disagree
with him may In the long run prove
to be his best friends.”

War Escalation

Morse’s basic area of disagree- 9°

meni concerns the escalation of war
in Vietnam. He Is firmly opposed to
America's presence there, but
pointed out that Congress has failed
to use any of the checks available
to It to curb the President’s activi-
es.

“You the people now have the
only check that Is left," he continued.
“The only way you can stop John-
son's bullets In Vietnam ls with
your ballots here at home starting
with the next election."

He urged the people to think long
and seriously about American's role
In the Vietnam war and to question
the policies closely.

n
c-

More Than Propaganda
He maintains, “Americans are
going to demand better answers than
the propaganda of the Pentagon and
the State Department are going to
give them."

Morse fears that the Escalation
of the war in Vietnam can only lead
ultimately to war with Red China.
In such a case there can be no win-
ner. Morse also believes that should
American push itself Into such a
war, it would .be fighting alone.

Morse’s solution to this problem
is to bring the United Nations into
Vietnam. Through the Security
Council, or if that falls, through the
General Assembly, on international
peace force could be sent into the
country to keep the combatants apart
and arrange for negotiations.

. Best For A”

As to such an action's effect on
American Interests, Morse con-
cluded, “The best thing that could
happen to us would be to be moved
out of a negotiating position in
Vietnam. And it would be the best
thing that ever happened to world
ace."
