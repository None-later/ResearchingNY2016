.  V the academic year to re- '
‘ View tlt'e'mahifold types of fine art

which, has been produced and ob-
served by the students and faculty
of this university. .

in retrospect, we find- that the
1965-66 year has been both qual-
itatively and quantitatively produc-
tive. Audiences in auditoriums,
churches, lounges, and galleries
have been treated to fine examples

' of drama, music, painting, read-
-, ings,,and sculpture.

t'Of Mice and Men" began the
Universityv’l‘heatre’s excellent sea-
son. The pleased audience left Page,

 and proceeded to Richardson Hall
- where it pleasantly viewed both

"Wapshot Scandal," and the show
which was probably the best of the
season, “Stop the World, I Want to
Get Off." The year closed with
MacLiesh’s poetic “LB.”

' Guest Artllts

Several fine guest artists pro-
duced‘ shows of differing topics and
quality levels. Included were “The
Firebus," “The Divine Comedy,"
the Triad Dance Company, and “The
Trojan Women." Not to be forgot-
ten, but in its own category, was
the riotous Revue, “Gypsy.”

Fine musical programs were pro-
ducted by the University’s Band,0r-
chestra, statesmen, and other chor-
al groups. The Christmas Singcom-
petition was the scene of some of
the finest choral singing of the
year, Theta Xi Omega heading the
pack of quality.

Many Muslcai Performances

Obviously, the many times the
musical organizations performed
cannot be enumerated here, but suf-
flce it to say, that when they did,
they provided a vital part of the
year’s arts program. It would how-
ever not be a very comprehensive
arts overview if one were not to
reconsider a few of the more out-
standing guest musicians.

The Bach Aria‘ Group was prob-
ably the flnest guest production.
The Brass Quintet however was
also notably exceptional.

In purely visual art, one had
only to visit the third floor of Draper
at any time during the year, or
several of the lounges across cam-
pus to view some fine student and
faculty art. The exciting new visual
arts magazine, "Observation," cer-
tainly earned a place in this arts
review.

As this year closes, we can look
to next years art with great expec-
tations.
