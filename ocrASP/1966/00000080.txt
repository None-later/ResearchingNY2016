Program to

Explain

Student Government

During the Summer Planning Con-
ference plans for a program of
orientation to government activities
were formed. At the time of the
conference, Student Association
president William Cleveland stated
that there was a definite need for
a program which would lieip new
students become aware of the many
duties of the student government.

Acquaintance with the operations
is to be brought about through ac-
tual participation in the various
areas. It is hoped that the new stu-
dents will take advantage of the
program for several reasons.

Duties at Government

Firstly, they will see the duties
oi the various government areas
and will learn the procedure of
operations.

Secondly, they will become ac-
quainted ~witii the people who are
active in the various areas.

'l‘hirdly, they will have the op-
portunity to gain practical knowl-
edge and to demonstrate their own

capabilities. All this would give‘
the student a better working knowl-
edge of the government activities
and a greater perspective at elec-
tion time.

Students interested would become
a non-voting member of the area of
their choice, and would change areas
each month. They would be expected
to act as a regular member would
with the exception of the voting
privilege.

VOL. Lli, NO. 28

For Bookstore Chaos

by Sort: Kittsley

The uproar among the students
over the new University Bookstore
resulted from the fact that there
was no booklist available to aid
students in buying books, and that
students were forced to stand in
line for hours before beingadinitted
to the bookstore.

Most students realized that incon-
veiileiices were bound to arise with
the mass transfer to the New Cam-
pus; however they felt that iii some
matters they had legitimate gripes.

University students Barry God-
frey, Class 60, and Richard Porter
Class ’08, botii felt, as did many
other students, that the Bookstore
should have been run on a non-stop
basis.

Booklist Available

On the inconvenience caused by
the lack of a hookiist,which resulted
from a computer breakdown, God-
frey commented that if better or-
ganization had been taken perhpas it
would have been possible to have at
least a partial Fall booklist avail-
able iii the Spring.

Porter stated that it “should be
better next year—we shouldn’t be too
harsh on the whole situation."

However he felt that if more at-
tention had been given to marketing
procedure some oftiie resulting con-
fusion could have been alleviated.

Porter cited an example oftlie fact
that the Bookstorehad trouble locat-
ing adequate outlets for the cash
registers thus decreasing the num-
ber of booklines which could have
been available.

The Main Dispute
The one point disputed by most
students was that iroiii Monday, Sep-
tember l‘J-\\'ednesday, September
21, the bookstore was closed dur-
ing mealtimes.

Iil Davey, present manager oi the
State University llooksiore, com-
mented on the situation in answer
to the widespread criticism.

lle explained that the manage-
ment had based its decision toclose
at mealtimes on two factors; the
problem of restacking the depleted
shelves, and the' fact that the em-
ployees had to have a time to eat.

With the Student Center, in which
the Bookstore was to be housed,
not completed, problems aroseover
where to pub the bookstore. The
library donated the space; however
the bookstore management ‘didn’t
know where they were going until
three weeks before the semester
opened.

Trollic Problems
The space was liiconvenient in
handling the large number of stu-
dents, and it was impossible to re-
stack shelves with the crowds.

Davey explained that by keeping
the shelves restacked they originally
hoped to make it possible for stu-
dents to have to come to the book-
store only once.

Also the m'anagement only had
three weeks to more into new ac-
commodations; these are the weeks
in which ilnal bookwork is usually
done. It was necessary topractically
drop bookwork during moving, thus
creating more confusion.

Other problems added to the

New Univergity Policy
Demands Discretion
In.Pnstiiig otNotices

This semester a precedent has
been set in University policy in the
posting of notices; for the firsttlme
individuals and groups will be
allowed the unrestricted posting of
notices at their desired location.

Already, however, the Adminis-
tration has become concerned by
the widespread deiaceinent oiwails,
doors, and glass, by tiie promiscuous
posting of placards of all types.

Walter M. Tisdale, Assistant to
the President on Planning and De-
velopment, expressed growing con-
cern ovei this matter and offered
a few suggestions.

Trullic Flow

It is understood that many of
these notices were necessary, even
before the advent of the fall semes-
ter, lll order to insure a reasonable
flow of traffic amongtheelghtthous-
and unoi'iented members of the Uni-
versui.

However, as great care was taken
in the planning of the campus to
provide a highly satisfactory teach-
ing environment, action has been
taken to provide for permanent signs
to deal with necessary traffic infor-
mation and for numerous bulletin
boards to contain individual notices
thus alleviating this problem.

As a matter of this proportion
would be impossible to police, the
Administration has asked that stu-
dents and faculty exhibit the proper
diacretion in dealing with posting of
notices, so as not to break with the
aesthetics of the campus.

Proper Locations
Persons desiring to obtain infor-
mation concerning proper locations
for the posting of such notices are
asked to contact persons in charge
of Student Activities.
