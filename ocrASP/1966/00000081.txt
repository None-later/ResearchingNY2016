Patti Switzer and I held sort of
an informal meeting last Thursday
night and began constructing our
lag-program for the coming year.
Of course, as I mentioned last is-
sue, “Greek Week" was the prime
topic of discussion. We’ve come up
with a tentative agenda which will
be presented to you for your judg-
ments and opinions in the coming
weeks. We're counting on your sup-
port to make this Greek Week the
highlighting function during the Uni-
versity year.

Office Space

We are doing all that we can to
get office space so that we will have
a central, efficient, and easily ac-
cessible coordinating body.

In two weeks, again as was men-
tioned last issue, we are going to
have an inter—fraternal meeting
hopefully with guest speakers who

will help us start off the year to
the best advantage. More news will
be coming about that.

We wish to express our sincere
hopes for many successful years
to Upsilon Phi Sigma who will be-
come a chartered fraternity this
year. 150 is hoping to see the birth
of a new sorority very shortly.
Anyone interested in forming a new
Greek group is welcome to seek
our help and support.

As a note of business, next Wed-
nesday there will be an ISC-IF‘C
meeting at 7:30. Immediately after-
wards there will be a Pan-Hellenic
meeting. Dress will be jackets and
ties for the gents and similarly'
appropriate dress for the ladies.
Thursday there will be a meeting
of all sororities and fraternities at
7:30.

Again we would like to express
our desire for a strong Fall Rush
and an eventful year.‘

Building Better Bridge

by Harry Nuckols

Duplicate bridge - match points -
differs from rubber bridge in many
subtle ways. Today’s hand illus-
trates the way a match point player
views the scoring of a hand.

The bidding is pretty normal ex-
cept for West's raise to two spades.
This is a duplicate bid paving the
way for a possible sacrifice. South
is willing to settle for seven clubs
since any grand slam is likely to
produce a good score at duplicate.

Then East decides to sacrifice at
seven spaces and South must pause
to consider. Most pairs will pro-
bably be in some slam with the
N-Scards. A small slam, even in
clubs, vulnerable, is worth more
than 1300 points, and the grand slam
more than 2100.

So in order to make enough by
doubling E-W, they must be set
eight tricks; or, to make up for the
grand slam, twelve tricks. And with
South’s distribution, that is moslun-
likely. Notice that 13- will be set
only five at seven spades.

Therefore, South decides that he
must bid seven no-trump. 'l‘he rub-
ber bridge player would most likely
settle for the sure set instead of
gambling on his partner having a
good diamond suit.

As you can see, the play is simple -
there are fourteen available tricks.
Ali’s well that ends well.

Bookstore Plagued
By Many Problems

failed to turn their orders in on
time; of the orders turned in on
time twenty percent were returned
as “out of stock,” or“ouiofprint."

Thursday, September 22, the
bookstore ran nonstop by stagger-
ing the eating times of employees,
and restacking the shelves as quick-
ly as possible in view of the traffic.

Coffee and Doughrnurs

On Thursday and Friday coffee
and doughnuts were also provided
for students who waited in the driz-
sle.

George Brewer, Director of the
Ancillary Service, commented that
there have always been lines with
the first rush. However, the fact
that this year’s lines had no place
as the peristyles, to queue up made
lines more uncomfortable.

:A bulletin prepared by the Ancil—
lary Service was seniio all members
of the faculty explaining that the stu-
dents did have legitimate reasons
for not obtaining books.

Davey feels that by Tuesday the
rush should be over and that the
Bookstore can begin to offer better
service to the students.

However Frank Endloveri, a grad
student summed up one unanswer-
able question when he said “Did the
bookstore coordinate with the Ad-
ministration?

"If they had looked at the space,

President Expresses
Thanks to ill leaders

in Their Assistance

Slate Uni-varsity at Albany Pres-
ident Evan R. Collins Today ac-
knowledged with appreciation the
cooperation of 15 New York State
government leaders who have ac-
cepted invitations to serve on a
special committee for the School of
Public Affairs at the university.

Dr. Collins said the newly-formed
Advisory Committee on Govern-
mental Services would meei per-
iodically to review the sciiool’s
programs in public administration,
executive training, and research
as they relate to the needs of state
government.

Gould Comments

_ In commenting on the appoint-
ments, President Samuel B. Gould
of State University of New York
said: “The School of Public Af-
fairs, now one of six graduate
schools of our University Center
in Albany, plays a significant role
in offering classes and degree pro-
grams for personnel in stale serv-
ice.

We are indeed fortunate, there
that the committee members are.
willing to give of their valuable time
and broad executive experience to
assist us in our planning. The com-
mittee, 1 am sure, will prove itself
of great value not only to the school
and the Albany institution but to the
State University as a whole."

President Gould pointed out that
New York State agencies have em-
ployed more than ’75 per cent of
the public administration graduates
of the School of Public Affairs.

Most of the school’s research is
directed to problems of slate and
local government with special em—
phasis on the government of New
York State. The school's Local Gov-
ernment Studies Center serves as
a clearinghouse for information on
metropolitan and urban develop-
ments which are reported in the
bi-monthly publication, “Metropoli-
tan Digest."
