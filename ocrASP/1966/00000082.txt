Before I begin the intended drivel which will be
incorporated into the text of this column, I shall
begin with a slight bit of maudlin writing involving
beauty which SUPPOSEDLY is artistic or aesthetic.

  

Isn’t the new campus beautiful? No? Well, I think
it is, especially at night. Before the minor deluge we
had, (which kind _of grunged things up) I noticed that
Mr. E. D. Stone has designed a campus for us which
is far more spectacular than Draper ever was(which,
by the way always seemed to be in a state of constant
grunginess). Not that I have anything against Draper
you understand; I will as probably many of you will
always feel rather sentimentally. in love with the old
place. However, my feeling begins and ends with
sentimentality.

      
 
 
 
   
  
 
  
    
  
   
  
 

 

Overgrown Ice Cube Troy

Admittedly, the new campus does have the look of
and overgrown ice cube tray or perhaps a monastic
Cloister. But you must admit (please) that it does
look also like an academic institution (whatever they
look like). Beauty, beauty, I almost forgot. The design
of the lighting in the library resembles a brilliant
poinsetta? Zinnia? Oh well. it is a very pretty ex—
ample of radial symmetry. At night the lighting from
all of those vertical windows (which are really not
fortress gun slits for Indian attacks as someone
mentioned) cast a golden glow over the proportionate
combination of straight and curved lines.

I think it's .pretty: if you don’t, ...ah. go look at
a sunset or something.

  

 

A Plug from Arts
Welcome Freshmen, how’s that for overly used
j trivia? Pretty good huh? Now that you have heard
plugs from every other organization on campus,
and you are now on the last page of the ASP, it is
time for a plug from Arts. Join Arts. There that is
it. Seriously, you have come to a school which is
rather proudly active in the field of Arts. The Drama
department produces four major shows a year plus
, many smaller productions, all of which are open to
i all students. The University Revue is a yearly. stu-
Y dent-produced musical which is also open to all.
This year'we are producing “Carnival.” Any of you
: newly-arrived actors, technicians, set constructors,
l and scene painters should make yourself know and
active.

Musically, State can use. happily, any singers and
musicians in Statesmen, Orchestra andotheraffiliated
groups. Several performances are planned for the
coming year and your talents will be greatly appre—
ciated by the entire University community.

Opportunities tor Exhibition

In visual arts, there are manifold opportunities for
exhibition of sculpture and painting. Youhavcprobably
seen some of the fine work done by the faculty which
is already on exhibit. Hopefully, “Observation.” a
magazine of the visual arts will again be published
by students of this University as it was for the first
time last year.

    
   
   
  
  

Thus, some of the artistic endeavors which are
available on campus are shown to be waiting for the
talent which you have brought with you, and hopefully
you will answer the call of “UNcle Sam wants YOU! "

laylor, Burton Score in ‘Wooli’

It can be taken for granted that
Edward Albee will never become a
marriage counselor. He has a de-
cidedly prejudiced view of the mat-
ter.
In the motion picture version of
his play “Who’s Afraid oi Virginia
Woolf?” Albee has two sadomaso-
chists married to each other. Thus
evenly matched both parties hate
their marriage and ironically hate
the thought of separation even more.

Both husband and wife are caught
up in a World of meaninglessness

Thooiro Auditions
For lysislroio

by Jay Deonehon

A university is like a great bear;
it exists In alternating periods of
activity and hibernation. For the
bear, as bright summer days wax
into the autumn chill, the time for
rest draws near. For a university,
after its summer slumber, this is
a time for new life. One of the sure
signs of the yearly intellectual and
cultural rebirth here at State is the
activity of the University Theatre.

With a heavy schedule planned for
this year, work is already under way
on the first production of the 1966-
1967 season, "Lysistraia," by Aris-
tophanes. Dr. Paul Bruce Pettit,
Director of the production, has an-
nounced that auditions for parts in
this classic Greek comedy are to be
held at 8 p.m. on Sept. 26-2711:
Page Hall. Dr. Pettit is particularly
interested in drawing new talent Into
the University Theatre and all in-
terested students are welcome to
attend. The performance date oi
"Lysistrala" is scheduled for early
November.

All phases of the production are
open to student participation. Those
interested in doing technical work
should contact Mr. Robert Donnelly
in flu-380.

and psychological destruction exist-
ing by means of bitter, exhausting
arguments.

Elizabeth Taylor, as Martha,
turns in a good performance, but
that Is probably due more to the
part than Mrs. Burton's histrion-
Martha, a liquor-drinking,
dirty-talking coquette rants con-
stantly about her husband's inade-
quacies while freely admitting that
she needs him.

George, her professor husband,
(played to the hilt by Richard Bur—
ton) likes to play the game of mar-
riage with his wife. He threatens
her with a phony shotgun and ulti-
mately destroys her mostimportant
playthlng, their totally intimate il-
lusion of having a young son.

George Segal, as Nick, is the real
acting surprise of the show. He is
competing with three people ofhlgh-
ly developed abilities, yet he very
well manages to remain in his cor-
ner of the spotlight.

Nick is a biologyprofessor, young
and on the way up. He knows that
Martha, as the college president’s
daughter, can bolster his career.
50 he throws over his wife (who's
busy throwing up) for a little while
to take advantage of Martha. It is
Nick who first comes to understand
George and Martha’s illusion.

Whatever its shortcomings thisls
a powerful motion picture. Despite
the tendency to go home and take a
cold shower after seeing it, no
prospective viewer should be afraid
of “Virginia Woolf."

Commissory Fire

Cousosllo Damage

by Ken Bernstein

Damage was minor as the New
Campus Commissary experienced
trouble with one of Its large com-
pressor motors shortly after mid-
night Tuesday morning. As Richard
li‘inke of the Commissary explained,
"a piston (of the compressor) let
go, and the luck of compression
caused the_ oil to back up."

The smoke seen coming from the
commissary was due to the backed-
up oil hitting the overheated motor
of the compressor which operates a
freez. r, and could better be called
a fog. This explanation erased all
the rumors of a hill-scale fire or
a possible freon gas look In the
Commissary.

Albany Fire Department

Units from the Albany and Mc-
kownville fire departments arrived
swiflly, as did Ii‘lnkc and others
com-erned. ’l‘hc McKownlelc units
utilized :1 blower to rid the build-
ing of smoke and prevented nny nd-
dIIIonaI damage.

There was no harm done in any
of the loud in the buildlng, and the
total amount of damage was limited
to dirt and grime resulting from
the burning oII.

Fortunate Colncldunco

Fluke explained lbat furihordam-
age was prevented by u vary for-
tunate coincidence. "One of tho

who put the refrigerators in, and
knew exactly what to do, cut-offs
and the like."

ASP to Publish Supplement,
Marks SOIh Anniversary

Celebrating its 50th an-
niversary this Tue sday, the
Albany Student Press will
publish a specialeightpage
supplement to the normally
four-page Tuesday issue.

The supplement will trace the
history of the newspaper since its
publication as the State College
News on October 4, 1916.

The idea of having aweekly news-
paper on campus was first intro-
duced through a skit presented by
the class of 1918 on Moving Up Day
In the spring of 1916. The idea
soon received the blessing of Pres-
ident Brubacher and a committee of
twelve was formed to work on the
newspaper.

Newspaper's Purpose

In Its first editorial the com-
mittee stated that the purpose of
the newspaper was “to make each
faction of our student organization
know and appreciate all others, to
uphold the maintenance of fraternal
regard ‘llld friendly rivalry among
all, to work for cooperation between
all sections and for the solidification

    

of the now separany wasted ener-
gies in the promotion of a real,
distinct, and enthusiastic spirit of
loyalty to State College.“

"In its columns,” the editorial
said, "you will feel the pulse beat
of the student body. It will be as
a mirror standing at an angle into
which a body peering will not see
his own, but rather the image of
another,"

Throughout its fifty year history
the newspaper has remained a stu-
dent newspaper under the students
control and completely financed by
the students.

Undorgono Many Changes

Since the first issue the news-
paper has changed from a weekly
four column tabloid to a bI-weekly
live column tabloid.

It has changed its name three
times in Its history from the State
College News to the State Univer-
sity News (1963) to the Albany Stu-
dent Press (1964).

A banquet is being planned as
part of the commemoration of the
golden anniversary. It will be held
in December and will feature the
return of ex-editors.
