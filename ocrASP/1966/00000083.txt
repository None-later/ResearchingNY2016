Army lieutenant accused of slay-
ing his wife’s attacker. Ben Gaz-

Focus on 

Dr. Iagadish

Member Of Research'eroup. -,

Its facilities and the promise of
a. new challenge prompted Dr.Jitga-
dish Garg to take the position of
professor of physics at the Uni-
versity this fall.

A prominent nuclear physicist,
Garg received his M.A. from the
University of Lucknow in India and
his doctorate from the University
of Paris in France. While at the
University, Garg will teach ad-
vanced nuclear physics and work
with the department’s high-current
ion and electron accelerator.

He is known nationally and inter-
nationally for important contribu-
tions to the study of neutron inter-
actions. Fast neutron measure-
ments, the physicist’s specialty,
will be one of the principal topics
to be investigated at the new ac-
celerator facility.

The Dynamitron particle accel-
erator, operating on direct cur-
rent, is capable of handling a max-
imum of four million volts of elec-
tricity. His work includes the study
of the structure of the nucleus and
the interaction of the nucleus to
the cell.

Dr. Garg feels that the Univer-

Oarg.  '

 

city is in I tr‘in‘iitory stage an
striving to develop research, which,
says Garg, "Is important for ex-
cellence in education." He hopes
this will attract other professors
from here and abroad.

Garg, who has written over a
dozen reviews for different sci-
entific journals, is looking forward
to student participation in his re-
search. Garg's work has led to the
development of new circuits and
electronic systems which will aid
in the future design of atomic re-
actors. -

Garg, who comes from Kenpor,
India, is a Fellow of the American
Physical Society and The Institute
of Physics and the Physical So-
ciety of the United Kingdom and is
a Membre Titulaire of the Societe
Francoise de Physique.

Garg has worked and studied with
Turner and Newell, The Physical
Laboratories, The University,Man-
chester, England; the Laboratory
of Atomic and Molecular Physics,-
College of France, Paris; and the
Indian Atomic Energy Establish-
ment.
