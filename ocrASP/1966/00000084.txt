Recently, there has been a con-
troversy over the implications of
the lyrics of some of our more
popular songs. Probably the most
prominent figure in this situation
is Bob Dylan. Some critics believe

that his “poetics” are narratives

of trips on LSD. A
However it is our feeling that 0
the interpretation of Dylan is highly  $4M lineage

to extract the meaning which lies '
beneath a symbolic muddle ofmeta-
phors, allusions and images.

 

Dylan's Music
Dylan’s music has gone through
a metamorphosis from protest folk
to “folk-rock" to hard rock. In
his latest album, Blonde Oil Blonde
(Columbia C2141), his arrangements

classrooms have been planned pur-

clocks.

Designed to focus the student's
attention on his professor, the
change has left the student popula-
tion with mixed feelings on its suc-
cess.

Clock Watching

Some students, for instance, have
replaced clock-watching with an
equally distracting hobby: specula-
tion on the amount of time left in
the class period. “About midway
through," explains Gerry Fraser,
class of 1970, “i start to estimate
just how many minutes more the
class will last. When it gets really
ady, I count"

Norman Early, a junior, sees no
rationalization for the change. “The

Last Tuesday's hand illustrated
why one might bid differently at
match points from the way one
would hid at rubber bridge. Today’s
hand shows how the importance of
overtrlcks allowed East to pull off
a nice swindle.

Tile bidding was normal. South's
jump to two no-trump showed a
balanced 19-20 points with the unbid

three no-trump, seeing that llislland
would produce six tricks if his
partner had the king of diamonds.

West led his fourth best spade
and East put up the jack, which i
South allowed to hold. East con-
tinued with the spade queen, won
by South’s ace. South was thinking
that if East held the king of din-t
monds, he would either have n05
more spades to lead or if he had i
another space, only two inoretricks
could be taken in the suit.

At trick three, South led the dia-
mond jack. West played the deuce,
dummy the three, and East the

The rubber bridge player, as
South would now see five clubs,
one spade, one heart, and two dia-
monds. He had contractor! for nine
tricks and he had them, so he
would take them. But at match
points, an over-trick is sometimes
worth more than making the con-
tract, and wouldn't South look silly
making only three when six was
cold.

So South finessed the queen of

 

diamonds at trick four. East now
