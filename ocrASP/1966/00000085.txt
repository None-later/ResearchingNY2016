Parking Problem

A choice between having to park a car
driven to the new campus or takingabus
might be difficult to make in view. of the
parking situation.

The large parking lot in front of the
Dutch Quadrangle is now almost always
filled to capacity. If an individual parks
his car in one of the distant rows, he
must walk some distance to reach either
the Dutch Quad or the Academic Podium.

If a resident of the Colonial Quad
parks there, it is an even longer walk
to his dormitory. Obviously the parking
lot in front of the Gym is even farther
from the Colonial Quad which is where
these residents are supposed to park.

There is temporary parking in a
wooded area across the university road—
way from the Colonial Quad. This, how-
ever, is still some distance from the
Academic Podium.

Cars have been parked directly in
front of the Colonial Quad on the area
soon to be landscaped. This plot of land
might be more useful as a parking lot
than decorative shrubbery.

Although the campus is purposely de-
signed to provide an atmosphere con-
ducive to study by preventing vehicular
traffic. this mode of transportation con-
tinues to be popular and shouldbe catered
to for the convenience of all involved.

Tradition llestmyed

It appears that MYSKANIA has at-
tempted to abolish one more tradition
on campus. That is the freshman skit.
The two guardians of the Class of 1970
informed the individual who was to be
in charge that they were not organizing
the skit.

Well, anyway, it was a big bonfire.

The freshman skit will hopefully still
be presented, but only because of the
perseverance of a few conscientious
students who recognize its worth.

This skit helps to organize the fresh-
men as well as to introduce them to
their fellow class members. There is
no better way to meet people and make
friends than in an extra-curricular ac-
tivity such as this.

The freshman skit has been a worth-
while tradition at the University, but
it is not being given approval by MYS-
KANIA, guardians of tradition.

Stall Increases

Any large group of individuals neces—
sitates appointing those who are more
authoritative than others. So it is with
a large university.

Criticisms and defenses have been
made concerning the disadvantage of
the huge community of SUNY atAlbany.
The hiring of a sufficient number of
new faculty members to maintain a
proper faculty-student ration has been
accomplished.

There are, however, so many person-

nel that no one is quite sure where to
turn for even the most simple task.
‘ Only the most persevering individual
succeeds in reaching his goal, even if
it is something as uncomplicated as
making an appointment with his own
residence hall director.

The accomplishments of a univer—
sity may be impressive, but an oppres—
sive bureaucracy can hinder and even
destroy the most important sector of
a university—- the people who attend
and teach at the university.

Traffic Safety Education Course
To Be Offered by University

Students are invited to take a
personal interest in the terrible
traffic accident problem that con-
fronts New York State today by
taking the first step toward approval
to teach high school and adultdriver
and traffic safety education.

The university is pleased to an-
nounce that the professional pre-
paration of potential driver and
traffic safety educators is being
resumed on a full time basis this
fall semester, and expanded to in-
clude the four phase program of
classroom, in-car, simulation, and
multiple car instruction.

Two factors have significantly
influenced the decision. The first
is the interest expressed by school
administrators to have an approval
to teach driver and traffic safety
education in addition to their major
secondary certification area.

Upgraded Requirements

The second is the recently an-
nounced upgraded teacher require-
ments by the State Education De-
partment to six semester hours of
credit to teach driver and traffic
safety education.

There are openings ill ille two

last time as such and in the future
will probably be a six week offer-
ing.

Parking Problem

To the Edllol‘:

As it now stands, the faculty
plans to turn the faculty, commuter
parking field into a weekend park-
illg arrangement only. Parking dur-
ing the week would be limited to 30
minutes.

Since the student population label
a minority, we feel we are getting
the short end.

With little effort the Colonial
Quad's “Wooded Parking Loi”could
be made to handle 150 cars full
time. This would require a mini-
mum maintenance.

We are not asking for a paved

... ~umyml‘iw‘lnm 

lol, only a flat surface. A student
must pay, and pay plenty, to earn
tilt: privilege of having a car.

The purpose of having a car is
to eliminate the inconvenience of
following bus schedules. As it now
stands, the University seems to be
doing its utmost to defeat this pur-
pose.

There ls available parking space
that is being wasted by not being
used.

The only conclusion to be drawn
is that when the administration
planned this $100 million plus com-
plex, they forgot the student.

New Theatre Building
Great Improvement

by Ed Longe

, ‘ 'Al‘lflirVSruocttr Pills:

  

In contrast to many articles which are found in
papers these days which concern themselves with
retrospect, I find that there is one subject which can-
not be treated in this manner. The subject. to which I
am referring is the new theatre building or rather
presently, the construction of it.

 
     

Recently, l was exposed to both side and top views
of aforementioned building, and was very much im-
pressed and excited. Though the new building willseat
fewer people than does Page Hall, only 550, there will
be no poor seats inthe theatre. This is due to a change
in the style of seating arrangements, and the elimina—
tion of the balcony. The style of seating is known as
Continental, which I learned is unbroken by any center
aisles, and utilizes only side aisles. There is also 1967
more leg room between the rows of seats. '

Exceptional Lighting System

Another improvement which Page Hall lacks is an
exceptional lighting system. Presently in Page, light—
ing instruments are mounted on the front edge of the
balcony, with the lighting technicians backstage. In
the new building, there will be lighting positions in
the ceiling, with the technicians in a lighting and con—
trol booth which is located in rear of the house. This
offers a much needed improved view of the stage by
the people who run the technical aspects ofthe shows.

This summer Tile Sal‘atoga Per-
forming Aris Center at Saratoga
Springs staged a triumphant and
successful premiere. Tile
$3,610,000 amphitheatre that took
300 men and 415 days to complete
opened on July 8 wlihaperforlnance
by The New York City lialiel.

The stage itself has been enlarged, and can be
further mechanically enlarged by an orchestra pit
floor which is able to be elevated to the level of the
stage. There is an improved system of raising and
lowering scenery planned, and a complex intercom
system among the control booth, the dressing rooms,
and the actor’s ready room.

Ballet Direction

The Ballet, under the direction
of George Ballallcllllle and Lincoln
Klrsieill, launched the Arts Center’s
first season with a performance of
"A Midsummer Night’s Dream,”
which received three showings. Nllle
other ballet sequences were per-
formed throughout July.

Decreased Seating Capacity

In regard to decreasing the seating capacity, it has
been observed that this is beneficial for a number of
reasons. First, to accommodate the university
community ill a smaller theatre, the number of pro-
ductions will probably be increased, thus giving stu—
dents more opportunity to work, perform, and thus
learn. Second, a play depends on a circular response
between audience and actors; a smaller theatre will
be more intimate, and thus each audience member
receives a more personal performance, and his
response is improved. Third, simply because the
size of the theatre is decreased, the audience will
be able to hear and see better.

One such sequence on July 14
consisted of Tschalkovsky's “Swan

Lake,” Camille Saint-Sachs “Irish

Soars to Hila

It seems as though the success
of Charles M. Schulz, creator and
writer of "Peanuts," and other
tl‘iilutal'ial cartoons, has become
deeply ellgl'allled lll Alllel‘lcall so-
ciety. This conclusion was reached
following the reception alld reading
of Siziluiz’ latest cartoon epic, Snoopy
and the lied Baron.

Thus, we of this university should all be anxiously
awaiting the proposed September 1967 completion
date of the new-theatre and its affiliated building,
and we undoubtedly will be.

‘Snoopy and the Red Baron’

rious Success

The reason for this conclusion
lies solely ill regard of the length
ill proportion to price. The hard-
cover edition of fills sixty page
volume is listed al two dollars.
An attractive feature of the book
is the alternation of the green and
yellow heavy grade paper.

Schulz Typically Humorous

Admittedly, Schulz was his typi-
cally very humorous self. As was
implied previously, the only com-
plllllli this reviewer illll-i with the
Work, is illal there is not enough
of the happy humor.

Snoopy and the lied Baron is de-
clared by the publisher, ilull, llille-
Illli‘l. and Winston, lnc., as being
Schulz’s first full length novel, and
“This is the Will' lIOVellSi'S wal'
novel.”
