, ,partgof last year we came out with
ptlmidtic reports, about possible success
,, we fall sports. We felt "that theaddition of an
outstanding fresh squad to the varsitycros's-country
team'would make the 1966 harriers a powerful run-
ning machinezonce again. The results of last week's
Mentclair meet verify our optimism. But turning to
the soccer field, we. find the situation a little differ-

ent. '

When a coach gomes out and says that “If we win
four games, the season will be a success,” well.
how can .we‘ be expected to maintain our high hopes?

But we are still at a less to explain the team’s
ineffective play to date. The squad suffered the‘ loss
of only a handful of seniors last year (4-6) and
yet this year’s team looks like they just learned to
play the game this summer.

Coach Joe Garcia claims the team is full of “de-
ficiencies-Jack of game experience. poor defensive
setups, lack of transition from defense to offense
and vice-versa, no poise, poor passing, ad infinitum,
including lack of depth.” And the coach still says that
his players are “coachable.”

The Danes have 13 lettermen— exactly one-half the
entire squad. The hooters also have four of the top
players from last year’s fresh squad, which enjoyed
only a mediocre record but played outstanding ball
on many occasions (five losses by one point). At
least seven of the returning lettermen have been
playing soccer together since their freshmen year.

What about the schedule? This seems to be the
team’s only feasible excuse for being in such a
miserable state. The team has yet to play three
more teams (not counting Quinnipiac) who entered
some form of national playoffs in 1965. How isa
team that has managed only a single goal in four
scrimmages and a regular game (23 goals against)
going to fare against these well—drilled squads?

* naval-n token. , Invitational: M

It looks like another outstanding year for Albany State’s Munseymen this falls, as
the the barriers looked very impressive in their 21-40 drubbing of Montclair State
last Saturday in a new campus meet. The Dane’s personable coach. R. Keith Mun-

sey, calls his 1966 squad “potentially, the finest we’ve ever had. The spirit is tre-
mendous." And these are the words of a coach whose teams have compiled a 32-3
overall record since the sports inception in 1962.

Junior Joe Keating
copped individual honors
with incredible final burst,
nipping Mentelair’s Jim
Harris in the final 200
yards, winning in 28:49.2
(5 miles).

Following Keating to the tape for
the Danes were Mike Atweil
(29:13.5), Don Beavers (29:14.5),
George Rolling (30:09) and BobMul-
vey (30:32.5).

Capped Top Positions

The Munseymen copped first,
third, fourth, sixth and seventh po-
sitions in the meet.

Jim Keating, Joe’s younger broth-
er, finished first for the yearling
harriers in the team's first time
trial. He was followed by Paul Roy
and Bob Holmes.

 

Tomorrow the barriers will travel
to LeMoyne College in Syracuse for
that school's annual Invitational run.

The LeMoyne Invitational attracts
some oi thé topcross-country teams,
in the state, including such power-
houses as Buffalo State (last year’s
frosh winner), LeMoyne (with indi-.
vidual winner of '64-’65 BillRipple)
and Hartwick. '

The runners entered in this meet
from State are the top '7 finishers
from last Saturday's Montclair en-
counter. .

Ripple, who holds the meet and
course records with a 19:35 clock-
ing over the 4.2 mile hilly LeMoyne
course, and Pat Glover, a Hartwick
Junior, are the pre-meet favorites.

Keating placed a respectable 10th
in last year’s meet, in which he
Ipaced the Danes to a sixth place
finish. The best the team has ever
done was a second place finish in
1964, when Tom Robinson, the fresh
coach, was the team’s top runner.

 

NOTICE

Recreation equipment will be
available upon presentation of a tax
card at the new campus tennis

Armed with these facts, we feel justified in calling
for one of two measures: either State really apply
itself and build a team worthy of this competition or
withdraw from it. We’re tired of prayingfor miracles.

Soccermen Hope To Rebound
After Quinnipiac Trouncing

by Dunc Nixon

The Albany State Great Dane soc-
cer team opened its 1960 season
Saturday suffering a 6-1 defeat at
the hands of Quinnipiac. Albany’s
.lone goal was made by high scoring
center forward Maurice Tsododo
with an assist by Yutulo Silio coming
at 6:06 of the fourth quarter.

The booters will play Bridgeport
in their first home game of the
season this Saturday at 2:00. The
game will be played on the new
soccer field located on the new
campus just below the athletic build-
ing.

Quinnipiac Scores lst
Quinnipiac was led by Bill Fuchs,
lion Ayers, and Fritz l'labermas.
Fuchs opened the scoring with a
goal at 0:57 of the first period.
Ayers than scored

twice in the

second quarter, and Fuchs and Ha-
bermas each scored in third per-

iod. Bob Hale rounded out the scor-
ing for the home team with a goal
Just before the final gun.

Coach Garcia Pleased

Despite the score Coach Garcia
was pleased with a number of indi-
vidual performances. The movement
of co-captain Tim Jursak from full-
back to center halfback late in the
third quarter sparked the team con-
siderably.

Coach Garcia was also pleased
with the performances of Getachew
flabteh-Yimer and Hendrick Sadi at
the other halfback spots. Both
started the game on the front line
and were then switched to the half-
back spots. Jerry Leggieri was also
impressive in the goal, as be made
many fine saves.

, Food Service Faces Problems

In Late Breakfast, Top Service

"As soon as student and regular
help jobs are filled, Food Service
plans to have a coffee hour immed-
iately following the regular break-
fast---and as soon as possible af-
ter that the reinstitution of conti-
nental breakfast."

Mal Corbley, Director of the Un-
iversity’s Food Service thus ex-
pressed the desire ef Food Serv-
ice to offer quicker, more adequate
service to the students.

lie explained that Food Service
itself is not presently satisfied with
the quality of service they are of-
fering; however, better service is
new dependent upon the alleviation
of several problems Food Service
now faces.

Kitchen Overload

Corbley listed the difficulties as
resulting from the overload of both
kitchens and dining room facilities,
and the luck of adequate help in the
kitchen.

The lack of a full work crew in
the kitchen stems from both u very
tight labor market in the Albany
area, and u lack of strident response
to :lvuilnhlc openings in the kitchen.

There is presently sixty upen-
ings in the kitchen available to stu-
dents which hnve not hconfiilod,nn(l
this contributes lo the problem of
overload.

Corbley stated that the kitchen
facilities were only designed to pre-
pare two meals a day for the 1,200
students on each quad. However, it
has been necessary for the kitchens
to prepare food for three meals a
day with the some amount of equip-
meni.

Lunch Rush

They are also fucod with serving
lunch to the five to six thousand
people who find it necessary to out
in the cafeterias daily, in a space
designed for about 2,500.

This overload should be allevi.

ated with the completion of the new
Student Center which will provide
additional space in handling the
lunch rush.

Therefore Corbley felt that con-
tinental breakfast may be discon-
tinued until the completion of the
Student Center and a new cafeteria.

The coffee hour would provide at
least a space for students to buy
coffee before the opening of the
cash line.

Along with William McKinnen,
assistant director of residence and
Corbley, Peter Haley, Colonial
Quadrangle dining supervisor of
Food Service expressed the deep
concern over the forced discon-
tinuation of continental breakfast.

Continental breakfast was begun

Co-chairmen Announce Events

two years ago and was the brain
child of Food Service itself. It was
designed to provide better service
for those students not wishing to
get up for early breakfast.
lnturiates Students

It is this lack of continental break-
fast, aleng with the problems of
lilies, which has infuriated most
students.

Corbiey explained that there are
always lines during the first couple
of weeks of school. This is duepar-
tially to a slow movement of the
lines themselves until new students
are able to orient themselves to
finding necessary items.

However, in the last week break-
fnst‘lines have been reduced ten
to fifteen minutes a day.

For Homecoming Weekend

Co-chulrnlau oi Homecoming ’00,
Frank Potrunc and Kileen Tracy
hnve announced the times and lo-
cntinns of thc m'unl for the Home-
coming Weekend, October Hand 10.

ing, and two concerts by Stan Gotz.

ness affairs, Milton Olson, is the

Student Tax Committee re-
ported on the number of
students receiving tax
cards without paying stu-
dent tax, and explained
that the committee is pre-
sently compiling a list of
the students in an attempt
to redeem the cards.

Parking Regulations

The Council also considered sev-
eral aspects of parking regulations.
Klaus Schnitzer explained that be-
cause the county llne runs through
the campus the payment of traffic
tickets falls under different de-
partments.

Students receiving tickets while
parked in the Albany area will pay
tickets to the City of Albany; stu-
dents parked on the other side of
the county line will be payingtickets
to Guilderland County, and tickets
incurred on parking lots belonging
to the State of New York will be
paid at the registrar’s office.

The question of parking lots was
also discussed, especially in re-
gard to the distance of the resi-
dent’s parking lot from residences.

Special Guest
Special guest of the Council-was
Al Davey, Director of Merchan-
dising Service at the University,
and present manager of the State
University Bookstore.
Davey discussed various aims of

Merchandising Service, many which
are connected with the completion
of the new Campus Center. Among
these are a large bookstore, with
completely new stock and the'insti-
tution ofIa tobacco and news stand
which would eliminate the need to
patronize the bookstore for small
purchases.

Also planned are a bicycle rental
shop, billiard room, barber shop,
and bowling allies.
