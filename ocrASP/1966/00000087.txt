Fresh Slut ..

To the Editor: ' ' ' . l

The 50th anniversary of the ASP
was celebrated in a way which up-
set me a great deal. I feel the edi-
torial on the supposed “death” of
the freshmen skit did MYSKANIA
and the class guardians a ‘great
injustice.

For the ASP’s information there
will be a skit, not instituted by a
member of the Sophomore Class
(sic), who decided to work inde-
pendently of the class guardians,
but by the Freshmen Class (sic)
itself.

The Executive Board of the Class
of 1970 made the decision to have
a skit. They have asked Ellis Kauf-
man to serve as‘advisor to them in
regard to this project. My personal
feelings on the concept of class
skits are not relevant.

What is important is thatthe mem-
bers of the Class of 1970 decided
to have one!

In the past, the, class guardians
have done all the planning and de-
cision making for freshmen ev'ents.
This year a system has been de-
veloped by Laur Kurz and myself
which will put freshmen inposltlons
of authority.

What particularly upset me was
the fact the editor of the ASP made
no effort to contact me to hear my
side of the story before writing the
editorial. Apparently you werelook-
ing for something to use to criticize
MYSKANIA.

Your choice of a topic was a poor
one. In the future when you are seek-
ing a topic for an editorial, lhope
you will not let your opinions pro-
hibit you from finding out all the
facts.

You seem all too pro-occupied
with the maintaining ofa tradition,
such as the freshmen skit. What I
am more concerned with as one of

is to 'do what I can to assist this
yegrts freshmen .adapt'to college
life andth help them become a part
of thisuniverslty community.

Lockers Needed

To the Editor:

Like most students, I am greatly
impressed by the academic podium,
and also, a little dismayed that so
much is uncompleted. The construc-
tion creates many problems which
we all hope will be alleviated when
the campus is completed.

However, there is one problem
which exists now, and will continue
to exist when all remnants of con-
struction have disappeared.Nolock-
erhs have been provided on,or near,
the academic podium for those stu-
dents not living on the new campus.

It is unreasonable to expect these
students to carry all the materials
with them which they need for one
day of classes. In addition to books,
students must port gym uniforms
made up of gym suits, sneakers,
socks, sweat pants and sweatshirts;
coats, umbrellas, and boots.

Can you picture one of these stu-
dents with a lunch tray? They will
be forced to leave their belongings
in various places around the cam-
pus, resulting in an increased num-
ber of lost and stolen articles.

Most students here are on tight
budgets, and cannot afford lost
possessions.

There were lockers on the old
campus, and surely there is some-
place on the new campus where
lockers could be installed at anom-
inal cost. Granted, the student body
was smaller on the old campus,
but even a three to one student-
locker ratio would be better than
the present situation.

Lack of Spirit

To the Editor:
Every September, when Albany’s
students reunite and discuss the

school's problems and prospects,‘

one subject invariably comes to
the fore- the enigma of school
spirit, or to use that fatal word,
apathy.

And each year the prospects for
extracurricular vigor look prom-
ising; after all a new and spirited
freshman class will arrive and ano-
ther portion of the new campus will
be completed, a source of school
pride.

However, as the year progresses,
the freshmen eventually get swal-
lowed up in the apathetic rut ot‘ the
upperclassmen. Why?

Some trace the, meager spirit to
the 'lack of- a’football team or a
divided campus or some other school
handicap. A better explanation for
our inanimate campus is the in-
doctrination freshmen receive upon
entering this University.

Every corner of this school is
inhabited with griplngstudents. Fri-
day’s Suppression (sic) leaves very
few aspects of the college uncriti-
cized. And the "in" word is apathy.
No wonder Albany’s freshmen are
so easily absorbed into the student
body-they don't have to do anythingi

It’s so very easy to bewail our
deficiencies, anyone can do that.
But where are all the gripers when
suggestions for improvement are
needed? Almost every student wants
a football team, yet only a handful
are working to achieve this goal.

If the cycle continues, another
freshmen class with great potential
will sink into oblivion. And once
again the upperclassmen will com-
plain about the apathetic campus.
This can only be described as path-
etic.

as celebrated by, college

newspapers are unique. Half-century, anniversaries
.should properly be the provincet‘of the old. yet col-
legepapers' are the work of the young. p ~

The Albany Student Press is fifty years oldioday.
’Its most experienced editors have been associated

' with the paper for only five years: 'the majority of its
staff has served less than two years. Editors past are
unknown to us except through" the recordthey have
left behind, and each generation has shaped the paper
according to its talents and interests.

The question arises then of the validity of the
present staff marking the paper’s anniversary in so
spectacular a manner. We admit that no lumps form
in our throats as we reﬂect upon the paper’s past.
Our circumscribed contacts with the ASP preclude

great emotion on this day.

Yet in the measure of the ASP’s fifty years we
see the measure of ourselves and the University. As
present staffers we can recognize, sympathize, and
draw consolation from the problems and triumphs of
our predecessors. Knowledge of the newspaper’s past
is knowledge of ourselves and knowledge that we do
not stand alone in our experience.

More importantly the newspaper serves as the great
link through which we may touch the University’s past.
As the only continuing chronicler of Albany’s life since
1916, the newspaper traced the aspirations, frustra-
tions, and daily events of our dynamic institution. In
performing this service the ASP has done the Univer—
sity well, and on this day this service should be recog-

nized.

_For us and the University it is a day of pride.

 

 

‘ Pan-Hell Report

by Joe Nicastri

From the questions i’ve been
asked and from what I’ve heard, the
slogan “Let’s Have a Successful
Greek Week" is on its way to be-
coming the impetus for a whole new
and wonderful Greek outlook on
campus. '

Although “Greek Week" won’t
be here until the first week of sec-
ond semester, our work started
about two weeks before school, and
now nearly all the committees have
been set up and the Greeks are
beginning to pick up momentum.

Guest Speakers

Some of the committees most di-
rectly involved are Open House
Communications, Guest Speakers,
and Quadrangle Co-ordinators.

Two other committees, the Fund-
Ralsing Committee, chaired by Lynn
Greene and Mike Gerber, and the
Evaluation Committee, chaired by
Flo Rlegelhaupt and Dick Clarke,
ISC and IFC Vice-Presidents, are
going to need your help and cooper-
ation throughout the semester.

I wish to extend a sincere vote
of appreciation to the fine job Jane
McElroy has already done as our
corresponding secretary. Next is
issue, I'll be able to publish a list
of all committee chairmen and mem—
bers of each of these committees so
that if you have any ideas or
criticisms, you will knowwith whom
to get in touch.

Open House

A few of the events tentatively
scheduled for “Greek Week" are
six open houses, two hours a day,
Monday through Thursday (three
houses will be open toindependents,
and three will be opened to the re-
maining Greeks, but closed to the
independents.)

The next day, six other fraterni-
ties and sororities will have open
houses, and this will continue on a
rotation type basis until Thursday.

t the Academic Podium, books
providing informative articles and
Greeks ready to answor questions
about our past, present, and future
will be set up at each one of the
class buildings.

Every evening at the home quad-
rangles, the sororities will all sing
their songs. Entertainment through-
out the week, such as art shows,
controversial speakers, happenings,
films, etc. will be provided by Dan
Hellenic Council.

At the conclusion of the week, at
least one bignnmo group and another
fine local group will play before a

 

Pan Hellenic beer party.

Now, I'm sure you’ve askedyour~
selves and others, and me and Patti
Switzer, "Where are we going to
get the money for all this?"

My answer is that, as I have al-
ready mentioned, we have a Fund-
Raising Committee, which will pro-
vide Various events such as con-
certs, a small beer party, a Greek
Talent Show, which will be open to
the entire University.

But, alld this is about the biggest
“but” you’ve ever seen, we’ll need
about seven hundred dollars to start
off with. IFC and ISC will contribute
a small part of this, and the rest
will have to come from you, the
Greek.

Dynotlons Asked

Pan-Hellenic Council has asked
each one of the sororities and fra-
ternities to donate at least a min-
imum of one dollar per member
to the drive to attain the necessary
funds to "have a successful Greek
Week."

We all have some small idea of
a united Greek system's abilities
and potentials. If you double or even
triple your own idea, then you will
be closer to the truth. A trophy will
be given to the fraternity or soror-
ity which raises the most money
within its group as recognition of
its achievements.

So when you see posters, and
there will be many of them, that
say "Support Pan-Hellenic Coun-
cil" and “Support Greek We ek," be
secure in the knowledge tiat your
group has supported us and is con-
tinuing to do so. ‘

Uniiiod Organization

The philosophies and purposes
of “Greek Week" are to promote
something we rarely see on cam-
pus: A UNIFIED GREEK ORGAN-
IZATION. Through this we’llio able
to become a strong and necessary
part of the University system.

We'll no longer function as one
or two individuals who have achieved
a high degree of responsibility, but
rather as an organization which will
unquestionably demand the respect
of the entire student body.

Any sorority or fraternity which
desires to make public any of its
activities, please send me n note to
thal effect at least one week in ad-
vance so that it will be included in
this column.

Meetings October 5
Wednesday night at 7:30 pm. in
rooms 128 and mm the Humanities
Building there will be the WC and
[SC meetings.lmmedlately following
these in the same rooms there will
be the Pan-tlolicntc meeting.
