Humor F reshens Campus Outlook

Humor is an integral part
of any interesting campus.
College students are quick
to laugh, but they are usual-
ly reluctant to do so about
themselves.

Albany’s student newspaper has
long served as a vehicle for pro-
viding its students with funny and
interesting jokes and stories. its

humor has been gentle in the main,
and sometimes a barb has been

Ad Come-Ons Support Paper Through Wit, Fads

The Story of Advertising
in connection with the State
College News traces back
to the very firstissue pub-
lished on October 4, 1916.
In the third and fourth coi—
umns of the sixth page the re
appeared an ad for Donnelly
and Hanna Druggists,

Along with this ad came five

others mentioning school supplies

Printers, men's shops, and a
tailor, along with three pharmacies
claiming to be "the college phar-
macy,” advertised in those early
days. The general effect of those
first attempts were generally uni-
form, complete with stock phrases
and sameness of approach.

Illustrated Ads

The first illustrated ads were
submitted by Schneibles Pharmacy
(advertising 3 Parker Pen) and
Spaiding Bros. asking the students
to "defy Jack Frost" and wear
their sweater, able to covertlie ears
when the weather turned cold, or

 

 

was putting in a conscientiously
conservative ad, as was Steet'el
Bros. and the Strand Theater, which
was able to proclaim Clara Bow in
all her glory.

Meanwhile, other promoters were
claiming great things for arch sup-
port shoes, and the telephone com-
pany was reminding men to call the
girl they left behind. Services of
national advertising agencies, hav—
ing been employed for a longtime
by other college publications, were
also used by State at iliis time.

These national agencies provide
so much space and income for the
newspaper by distributing ads from

doing their part" in the general
run of things.

One of the most ingenious ads
appeared in late ’37, when a novelty
shop advertised a new Bridge Des-
sert-individual servings of ice
cream sculptured into “striking
replicas of playing cards.”

War Bond Appoul

1943 brought with it urgent appeals
for the purchase of War Bonds,
usually putting it in words like,
“let your purse do the fighting."
That, and Coca Cola, appealing to

millions through their servicemen-
making - foreign - friends - ap-
proach, plus a few local well-wish-
ers, comprised wartime advertis-

ing.

Since that time, State has been
advertising the wares of the Co-op,
local merchants and national ads,
in a style that tends to be easy and
informative. Cigarettes, even Max
Schulman, have been struck off the
appropriatedist, but the ASP con-
tinues to retain good community re-
lations through the voice it allows
the merchants to use on its pages.
