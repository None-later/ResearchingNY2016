ASP Comes Alive From Chaos
As Staffers’ Toil Pays Off

In the living room of the
Van Rensselaer Hall the
ASP staff labors Sunday
through Thursday night in
order to meet its twice
weekly deadlines.

it is in the noise and confusion
of the newspaper office that each
issue is conceived and goes to
“he” ever) Sunday and Wednesday
night.

The first step in the production
of tiie paper is laying out each
page and assigning stories to no
written. The iniorniation for the
stories are procured irom news
releases or through interviews.

After the story is written it is
sent to a compositor who types the
copy. This copy is pated on lay-
out sheets which are photographed
by the printer who makes plates
to print the newspaper.

This method oi printing is called
photo oiiset as opposed to the letter
press method used by most news-
papers. It requires more work on
the part of the stall since people
are needed to do pasteups.

The writing oi” headlines is done
by members of the staiil. Each
story is assigned a separate heati-
line style which has its own litie
counts. \\'l1en ilie headline is writ-
ten it is run oii‘ on a headline
machine which operates onlhe same
principle as photography.

The finished headline, like the
copy, is pasted tip on the layout
Sheet.

Another phase in producing the
newspaper is photograph). ’l‘he ASP
has its own photo SCI'YU'P which is
sent out to take pit-titres oi various
happenings on campus.

'l‘hei develop their own ﬁlms
and print the pit-titres which are
used in the newspaper.

Advertising

Part oi the expense oi publishing
the newspaper is deterred by rev-
enue raised through adtertisemcnts
in the newspaper. A separate stall
is in charge oi” HUIICIlliii' .nis.

l’roiltn-ing the ASP inn-e :1 week
involves many long hours and niin-h
hard work, lllli the satisitn-tion oi
witnessing the irtiits oi Ineii Iahor
l\l'ii'(,' a week is the reward it-atped
by the ASP stall.

There are still 75 shopping days
until Christmas, but the brothers
of Alpha Pl Alpha have launched a
.progra’tn called "‘Operatlcn Shop

day season a little brighter for
servicemen in South Vietnam.

The American National Red Cross
has asked APA’s assistance in fill-

' lug "Ditty bags” for an expected

360,000 of our soldiers in thatarea.

The brothers hope to set up large
Christmas Packages in the Flag
Rooms of each quadrangle, Bru-

Academic Podium. It is hoped
that students will donate a number
of these small, inexpensive items
for this worthy cause. ,

October 15 all of the articles
will be collected and packed by the
brothers for direct shipment to
South Vietnam.

The following items are suggested
as fillers: ballpoint pen, packages
