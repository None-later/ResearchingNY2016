Booters, [hop 2nd Straight:
'vn With, New 'Paltz Tomorrow

by Dunc Nixon

With both teams slipping, sliding. and falling on a
swampy field, the Great Darle booters of Albany
dropped their second straight contest. of the season to
a powerful Bridgeport squad- by the score of 4-0. The
soccermen will try to break-into the win column to-
morrow when they face New Paltz in a home game at

4:00.

The Bridgeport Knights
jumped into an early lead
when Alex Popovitch tallied
at 3:30 of the first period.
Paul Diekman’s score at
1:45 later upped the count
to 2-0.

State mounted a brief threat later
in the quarter, but they were stymied
when Maurice Tsododo’s shot
caromed off the crossbar.

In the second quarter Bridgeport
cont! ‘lled to control the ball, but it
became increasingly difficult for
them to do anything with it.

Their only goal came on apenalty
kick. Bridgeport All-American John
Verfaille rocketed the ball into the
upper left-hand corner, but one of
his teammates was offside. The
referees nullified the goal, but then
reversed themselves and gave Ver-

lfallle a second shot. He duplicated
his first effort, and Bridgeport lead
3-0.

Great Danes Tighten

The Albany defenses tightened
considerably in the third period.
Fullbacks Mike Hampton and Tony
Glaser played inspired ball, while
co-captain Dick Szymanski did an
outstanding job at the center full-
back position.

Bridgeport got its final goal at
20:17 of the fourth quarter when
Alex Popovltch registered his sec-
ond goal.

Although the Knights dominated
throughout, with a 30-4 advantage
in shots taken, Albany goalies Joe
LaReau and Jerry Leggieri were
extremely stingy. Each had eight
saves and very few of them were
of the easy variety.

Frosll Drop Opener

The fresh soccer yerlings dropped
their opening game to RPI irosh
Saturday by the score of 5-1. Bart
Koehler’s sharp drive past the RPI
goalie with 27 seconds remaining
accounted for frosh's only tally.

Remainder of the 1066 varsity
soccer and cross—country sched-
ules.

Expands Activities
lo Investigating

by Ken Bernstein

Logos Popularii, the sociology
club of the University, has decided
to remove its study of sociology
from discussions and lectures and
put it on a more practical level by
becoming all unofficial investigating
body for the campus.

The new course of the club was
announced at its first meeting Tues-
day evening. The first target of in-
vestigation will be the University
bookstore. After an admittedlyllasty
and ill-prepared poll, the executive
members of the club found that
certain mysteries of the bookstore
were bothering the student body.

Vindicativc Attitude

Throughout the meeting, Presi-
dent Proulx reminded lnembersthat
the club must first of all find con-
crete facts and even after that, it
could only make them available to
the student body. The club itself,
he reminded members, has noauth-
ority whatsoever to make demands
on any body investigated and would
try to avoid a vindicative attitude.

Club members posed seven or
eight specific topics about the book-
store to be studied, which were then
placed under one oftwo committees.

Possible Co-Op

One committee will do a com-
parison of prices with other area
college bookstores, while another
will concern itself With the pros
and cons of the true co-op set-up
for the University.

Throughout the year, the club
will conduct polls on just what is
troubling the student body and then
proceed to get the facts.

For the benefit of new students
and others unaware of tile bookstore
code, the three letters above the
price you paid for the book stand
for the price the bookstore paid.
The code is: STAN FORDEL, with
S standing for 1, T for 2 and so
on. Therefore NFL would be $4.50
and DTI“ would be $8.25.

Speaker To Discuss
Poverty In Albany

“Anti—Poverty ill Albany" will be
the topic of a speech delivered in
Brubachel' Hall by George Bunch
on Monday at 8:30 p.m.

Bunch is the chairman of SEN-
CAP (South End Neighborhood Com-
mullity Action Project), an organ-
ization which has recently been
active ill local anti-paverty action.

The purpose of SENCAP, ac‘cord-
lllg to Bunch, is to "mobilize the
resources of the Albany community
to benefit the residents of the South
End.” In purslllllgtllis goal, SENCAP
works closely with neighborhood
organizations like the Catherine St.
Civic Organization, and has occas-
ionally joined With such groups ill
demonstrations against specific in—
justices.

In his talk, Bunch will discuss
the problems SENCAP has had to
face, the methods it has used to
meet them, and the Albany com-
munity's reaction to its efforts.

[lunch will be the first ill aseries
of speakers to he presented by this
year’s Freedom Council, a campus
civil rights group which feels that
it is going to be increasingly im-
portant lit the University.

"Civil rights is IUU bignlltssue,"
says the Council’s president, Rich-
ard Evans, “to continue evading
our vision. Students everywhereare
looking at the issues and becoming
involved. Albany State will be no
exception."

Collins Holds First Conference
With Student Press Media

Enrollment figures was the first
topic of discussion at tile first
press conference with President
Evan R. Collins Monday. There are
now 7,250 students compared to
0,000 last year. 5,000 are under-
graduates and 2,250 are graduates.

President Collins, however, re-
iterated the i'act that as the student

population increases so does the
faculty. Last year the faculty-
studelzt ratio was 15.2 to l and

 

PRESIDENT COLLINS hold a press conference Monday to dis-

cuss some of tho questlons that

have been voiced on campus.

this year it is 13.2 to 1.

Pattern Set

There are approximately the same
number of freshmen this year as
last which will be the pattern for
the next few years since most ex-
pansion of the University will occur
on the upperclass and graduatelevel.

Tile next topic discussed was
women's hours. Last spring the
proposal concerning a change in
women's hours was passed in sev-
eral student committees, Living
Area Affairs Commission and a
Committee on Residences.

lt will be considered shortly by
the Commission on Residences of
Student Affairs Council. After that
committee it should be presented
to the University Council. Thispro-
cedure should occur tilts semester.

Concerning the bus schedule which
has caused some consternation on
the part of many students, the Pres-
ident stated that steps are being
taken to alleviate some of the prob-
lems. More buses are being added
at the peak hours and additional
buses which were not previously
scheduled.

Bus Stop Shelters

ltain the first week pointed up
the need for shelters which will be
constructed in the near future at
the bus stops.

Since several students have ex-
pressed collcern over the Selective
Service form 100, President Collins
commented that the forms were
sent out last week for all students
who wished to have them sent.

A delay in the mail which has
been experienced by students at the
new campus should be corrected
this week.
