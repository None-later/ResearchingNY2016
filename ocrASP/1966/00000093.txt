T0 Present‘New Views

“For this size campus,

we weren’t too satisfied

with the kind of articles being written: there was just
not enough variety.” Having this view. Bob Fullem
and Jim Stewart have reorganized “Counterpoint,”
a paper that was first published during the 1963-64
academic year but then lapsed into a period of in-

activity.

The original editors, Bob
Judd and Bill Morgan, had
wanted a fresh approach in
college journalism, and
“Counterpoint’s” new edi—
tors have somewhat re-
echoed this goal.

In their hope that the paper will
act as a“tinifying force on campus,"
Fullem and Stewart will attempt to
gain an audience among all major
fields, including math and science,
as well as the liberal and fille arts.

Responsible Articles

They want responsible articles
that are worth reading, and so they
have enlisted the talents of “people
who know their fields.”

Jitn MacVean, a graduate of Al-
ban), whose hobby is tile cinema,
will write the movies and book re-
new column; junior John Spross,
actiye on the Music ahd the Arts
Councils, heads the arts column;
senior liay Auerbach, who ltad the
Des! overall record on the chess
team last year, will be the chess
columnist; and [)1ch Taylor is the
new itiath and science editor.

"Counterpoint," which will collie
out every two or three weeks, will
focus on quality, tioi quantity. in
addition to regular articles, each
issue will investigate a particular
topic in depth.

Proposed Features
Such proposed features include a
study on students abroad, which will
intervtew foreign students, Ameri-

 

can students who have studied
abroad, or faculty members who
have taught in both the United States
and iii other countries.

Another feature story under con-
sideration is "Religion on a Secu-
lar Campus."

Students Give Friars
Standing Ovation

Last Saturday’s folk concert spon-
sored by the Newman Association
ended with a standing ovation by the
near 200 strong audience for "Sing-
lng Friars.” The reason for their
soaring popularity was apparent to
anyone who heard this vibrant,
swinging group.

Where did this group originate?
Well, Halloween is a night of weird
happenings] And so it was when the
"Singing Friars” (yes, they are
really friars) first appeared last
year at St. Anthotiy’s-on-tlie-liud-
son at Relisselaer. Thereafter, they
worked with the poor in connection
with Trinity Institute.

Because of the demand for the
group, they decided to cut a pilot
record for an album. The record
will be coming out soon and will
include four originals: “The Time
and Just a Friend,” "Green
Stamps," “The Sentry," and “No
Place to Go."

For those who missed the con-
cert, keep posted in the ASP or

ning of Albany State University, Dr.

tunity to assist in seeing things are
done in alt efficient way, while recog-
nizing faculty: and students as indi-
vidiials.

Among his many and varied duties,
Dr. Olson must see that 'Manage-
ment conditions are such that they
are conducive to learning.’ He must
"determine the number of students
we are to have" alld make adequate
plans for their accommodation.
Moots Demands

Getting faculty appointments, that!
and telephone facilities, along with
the electricians and carpenters iti-
cluding a staff of over 300 em-
ployees are all under his jurisdic-
tion. ills problems, thougll many,
do not include those of the book-
store, however, since ills interest
lies in ‘keeping the University
going,’ be is aware of the problem.
lie must deal witli‘lmmedlate prob-
lems while changing systems’ to
meet new demands.

Having been with the University

   

  
all races Challenge In New

son is familiar With its facilities
and must see that they ‘operate‘to
the advantage of the students and

come better people,' better edu'-
caied; to help them find a place
for themselves. A person must be
prepared to work and also be an
intellectual consumer of goods and
services to live a better life.’
