SENIOR‘AILEEN SCHLEP interned in Washington, D.C. This

summer in the office of Senator

Robert Kennedy. She was spon-

sered by a grant from the University.

‘ Farmer Sees Need

For United America

by Aileen Schlef

“The Negro is people; the pain
which he suffers is the pain of a
human being." In this manner,
James Meredith began his talk with
two thousand people who jammed
into three lecture balls at the Col-
lege of St. Rose in Albany, Monday
night. There Meredith touched on
the many topics relevant to the
present status of Negro-white re-
lations in the United States.

The 38-year-old Meredith was
born and raised on a 84-acre farm
in Mississippi with nine brothers
and sisters. He gained national
prominence as the first Negro to
enroll at “Ole Miss,” the Univer-
sity of Mississippi.

Negroes as individuals

Meredith expressed the desire
that Negroes be viewed as individ-
uals who are inherently different
in their views. "Would you expect
Robert Kennedy to sound like James
Eastland (Miss. Senator)?” he ques-
tioned. Then it would follow that two
Negroes in differentsocial positions
or different sections of the country
would not share the same ideas.”

Meredith stated that he greatly
feared the Northern and Western
urbanites who had not yet made a
decision as to which course they

wanted Negro-white relations to fol-
low. The recent demonstrations in
Chicago showed that the majority
of white people were not ready to
accept Negroes as neighbors.

Freedomto lec

To Meredith, Civil Rights means
freedom to live where one wants.
If that be Harlem, then Harlem
should be a nice place to live. A
white person should be able to
walk within the environs called Har-
lem.

What can the Negro do? Fore-
most, Meredith feels, he must
parallel his family structure to the
patriarchal family of the West. Pre-
sently the Negro woman serves as
head of the family. For everyNegro
male in college, there are seven
Negro women. In more than one
third of the families where the
mother is under thirty-five there
is no father present. Meredith en-
visons a new focus on the Negro
malemand his needs.

Should there be another World
War, Meredith believes thatitwould
have to be faced by a truly United
America. He cautioned that “we
must learn to live together lest we
find ourselves serving tea to our
Eastern neighbors."

' Senior“ in D.C."

_ As Assistant to RF-ll v

Senior Aileen Schlef this sum-
mer became the first student from

the State University at Albany to.

participate‘ in the student intern
program in Washington, D.C. Aided
by a grant from the University's
Faculty Student Association, Aileen
secured a job in the office of Sena-
tor Robert Kennedy of New York.

Aileen's project to work for Ken-
nedy began in 1984 when as Pub-
licity Director for the Albany County
Young Democrats she worked on
the Senator's campaign.

in 1965, she gained further ex-
perience in her Congressmen Ten-
zer's office.

Interviewed for Job

In February 1966, Aileen had her
first interview with Kennedy’s of-
fice. After a second with the Sena-
tor's administrative assistant, for-
mer Deputy Assistant Attorney Gen-
eral of the United States, Joseph
Dolan, she was informed that she
preference would be given to those
students whose schools award them
financial assistance.

The intern program is only par-
tially financed by the government.
Each Congressional office receives
a weekly stipend of $75 for the pro-
gram which suffices smaller offices.
It remains for Senators like Ken-
nedy, who hire as many as 15 in

D.C. to pay student workers from“

their salaries.
.Awarcled Necessary Grant

Through the efforts of Dr. Webb
Fiser, vice-president of academic
affairs, Aileen obtained the neces-
sary grant, and started what she
hopes wil become a continuing pro-
gram at State.

She noted that, to her knowledge,
no state university had ever been
represented before in the intern
program. ‘

"Kennedy," Aileen comments,
“shows a real belief in youngpeopie.
The staff assistants are all young
women under the age of 26. The
entire personality of the office was
youthful."

30,000 Letters 0 Month

Aileen reports the Senator's mall
volume to be 30,0001etters received
each month, concerning matters
which ranged from “national impor-
tance to personal problems.”

She worked primarily in military
casework, handling letters regard-
ing veterans administration, pen-
sions, serviceman’s problems, and
selective service. “The Senator
makes inquiries on behalf of these
people," she explained, “we
assist."

With Kennedy's emphasis on
youth, it was “only natural” that
the staff follow in the Senator'slove
of athletics. Aileen and her co-
workers spent many evenings and
weekends playing touch football, ten-
nis, or swimming at the Kennedy

Estate.

The summer in Washington was
climaxed by a party for N.Y. in-
terns at the estate.Aileen describes
Kennedy’s home as beautiful but the
least ostentatious on the lane--very
much the home of nine active chil-

dren."
commenting on the Intern Pro-

gram, Aileen summarized her feel-
ings: “The experience and insight
that I gained is invaluable. The op-
portunity is there; the only thing
preventing people from seekingjobs
in Washington is their own lack of
initiative."

He served in Washington with the

served in southern India for two

During this period, Dr. Birn de-
livered lectures at the universities
of Madras, Annmalai, Madurai, Sri-
Venkateshra, and Kerala. He also
supervised productions in Tamil,
an Indian language which he studied
for six months, for the Voice of
America.

“Indian students are very active
in student politics," Dr. Birn said.
"An example is the student riots
that broke out in protest against a
decision to impose Hindu as the one
important language and neglect the
others."
