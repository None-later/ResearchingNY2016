But eftendri, the University is designed so. that no man may reach town.

tan Serve Vital Purpose

President Collins traveled to Ryck-
man Hall last Monday to hold the first
press conference of the year with stu-
dents. It seems odd that with all the
talk on campus about the red tape and
big bureaucracy that the president of
the University is the most accessible
person in the Administration.

The press conference can serve a
greater purpose in improving the com-
munication between the Administration
and the student body this year than in
any previous years.

It can serve as a sounding board for
those people who have complaints. It is
a shame that only we were present at the
first conference.

The student body is lucky that the
president has a genuine concern for
keeping in touch with his students. He
has extended an invitation time and again
to students to come to the conference.

We hope that all the complainers on
campus will start taking advantage of
this vehicle for communication. The
conference is held every Monday at
2:30 p.m. in the director’s suite of
Ryokman Hall. '

organization Possible

Compliments must go to the Univer—
sity Bookstore and Student Activities
Office for the calendar of events which
they recently produced. itis embellished
with pictures as well as the listing of
campus activities.

It is now possible to View five months
at a glance. Students may plan weekends

and term paper assignments in an at-
tempt to organize the entire semester.

The squares indicating the days of the
month permit enough room, as in the
former calendars, to write down notes
and reminders.

Events of all organizations are listed
combining social events, sports activi-
ties and academic deadlines such as
mid—term dates and the last day to add
or drop a course.

Better organization is a needed qual—
ity at this university and this could be
a step in the right direction.

Publications Encouraged

Other publications on campus are not
to be scorned. Realizing that we are not
the best (nor the worst) publication,
another chronicle can add to recorded
facts and develop opinions which the
ASP is not always able to do because of
its nature.

suppression appeared last Friday in
its customary caustic form. It empha—
sized some things that had already been
said and put into words some ideas that
had only been thought or whispered.

fCounterpoint” made its recent debut,
recreated after a length absence. on
Tuesday. With an increased studentbody
there are bound to be a variety of per—
sonalities. One publication cannot cater
to them all.

Competition is healthy in all en—
deavors, even journalism. We, there—
fore, welcome these currentpublications
and encourage any others in spite of the
controversies that may develop between
us.

in: knows

by Sherman Richards

Good evening, ladies andgontle-
men, welcome to the Mock'Expres-
sionlst's Theater for the Promotion
of Better Human Understanding. I
will be your host for an evening of
mock entertainment. Since I' can
sense your anxiety, let us begin.

Act One

In the center of the stage we- have
Mrs. Johnson hugging her five year
old son. She is kissing him because
he looks so cute in his little army
uniform. She is telling him how
handsome he looks.

He pulls away from her grasp, puts
his little gun on his little shoulder,
and starts marching around her. She
throWs her hands up in the air sur-
rendering and exclaiming if he were
in the war, those bad men would
surely 1658.

Act Two

Just off center stage to the left,
again we have Mrs. Johnson hugging
her son who is now fifteen .years
old. The reason she is kissing him
is to make up for her yellingat him.
Just a few minutes before while
going through his drawers, she had
found a pamphlet on opportunities
in the air force. She was quite dis-
turbed.

 

 

" i e r'r\ t'e‘i i's‘s‘r'
' ‘ ‘ 's‘» :3 l's' N ’4'
'. ‘lz'Jll'a" Ilv' ' '

 

Now she is telling him how proud
she is that he soon will be going to
college. She isn't telling himaboui
her' fear that the world conﬂict will
soon become a world war and that
her little boy will be called upon
to serve.

Act Three .

0n the far left side of the stage,
we have Mrs. Johnson standing
alone; she is crying. She has just
finished hugging and kissing her son
good-bye. Only a few weeks ago her
son (now twenty-five) had been work-
ing on his doctorate thesis which
was entitled "The Preservation. of
the Human Race or How to Stop War
Forever.” Then one dayanuncarlng
draft pulled her son into war.

She is still crying as though she
has lost her son forever.

Afterward

We now have a very happy Mrs.
Johnson standing on the right side
of the stage hugging and kissing
her son. He has just returned home
from two years of action, he has
been greatly decorated for bravery,
and soon he will be released.

Mrs. Johnson is telling him how
handsome he looks in his uniform
and how proud she is of his efforts
to keep a weak people out of the
hands of those bad men. She should
be proud of her son; maybe some
day he will become President.

Building Better Bridge

by Harry Nuckois

The hold-up play is a technique
in every good declarer’s bag of
tricks. It should also be in a de-
fender’s. In today’s hand, East got
the rare opportunity to use it twice
(with some invaluable help from his
partner.)

East was able to read his part-
ner’s lead as “top of nothing,” and
therefore placed South with the
missing spade honors. Also seeing
that the spade king would probably
be needed as an entry to dummy,
East didn’t woodenly play the ace
and return his partner’s lead, he
played the five. Hold-up number one.

South won the ten of spades and
led a small club. West play-thetwo,
dummy the king and East now held
up again. South now led dummy’s
two of diamonds and finessed his
jack. A club to the board was taken
by East and he returned a heart,
South playing the queen and West
the king.

West exited with a spade, and
South was stranded in his hand as
East played the jack. There was one
more chance, but diamonds didn’t
split, 50 South ended up one trick
short.

But how did East know to take
the second round of clubs and not
wait until he was sure South was
out? West told him. West played
first the two and then the seven
of clubs. This says, “Partner, I
have an odd number of clubs in
my hand." Since East can count,
that South has exactlv

two clubs.

If West had an even number of
clubs, he would have played high-
low. Now notice how many mis-
takes East could have made. At
trick one, he could have taken the
ace. At trick two he could have
taken the other ace. At trick four,
he could have failed to take the
ace. At trick five, he could have
led a card other than a heart. And
at trick six, he could again have
taken the spade ace. Any of these
mistakes would have allowed the
declarer to make the hand.

Defense is tough.

by Ed Longe

It seems as though there is always somethingparenr
thetical to preface this column. Thankfully, itis nearly
always in regard to the Arts. In today’s case. the piece
of procrastination is a poem which has to do with the
love of life and Art. The reason it is being printed is
because I have thus far futiler sought for its author.
It has finally reached the point when I must go to this
column’s readers for the answer.

I strived with none,

for none was worth the strife.

Nature I loved,
and next to Nature, Art.

I warmed both hands over the fire of life.

It sinks,

and I am ready to depart.
If any reader is sure of the author, please contact

me through this newspaper.

Lysistrata Cast
Now that Lysistrata has been cast, the listing to be
found in this paper, an interesting facthas been noted.
If there has been any question regarding the possibil—
ity or the probability of a freshman’s being cast in a
lead role, Lysistrata proved that it is quite possible.
I am speaking of the young woman who has been

cast in the title role.

Miss Barbara Untracht has

shown a great deal of acting talent and potential.

This clearly shows (to any skeptics) that the lead
roles in University Theatre productions are not held
exclusively to upperclassmen. The statement of this
fact should also be of encouragement to othertalented
freshmen who could possibly have been reluctant to
try out because they felt that the better roles would

be held for upperclassmen.

Furthermore, this is not a recent development.
Freshmen, according to Dr. Paul Bruce Pettit, have
often secured lead roles in University productions.
Another example occurred just last year, with Scott

Regan obtaining a lead role

production, “J.B.”

New Business,
Added To Spee

by Jay Denehcn

The subject of the momenihere at
State seems to be that of change and
expansion. With an eye to the future
the University Theatre is also un-
dergoing many such changes. While,
for the present, actual productions
will remain at the theatre in Page
Hall, offices and classes have been
brought to rooms in the Humanities
building.

Among the new faces found within
the University Theatre staff, under
the direction of Dr. Paul B. Petiii,
are William Frankonis and Ted
Glazei'. To these two young and
graciously articulate gentlemen

Publicity Men

clr, Drama Dept

the business office and publicity of
the University Theatre.

This burdensome task was for-
merly under the supervision of Ed-
ward Mendus, who remains direc-
tor of the regional offices of the
New York State Community Theatre
Association and A.N.T.A.

Fronkonis Handles Business

Frankonis handles all of the busi-
ness aspects oflhe University Thea-
tre as well as doing graduate work
towards his M.A. in theatre. His
college career interrupted by alour
in the Army, Frankonis graduated
from State in 1963. lie was, briefly,
an editor of the ASP and a regular
contributor to “suppression.” With
this background he is well chosen
for his job.

Glazei', whose wife is a State
Student, is a graduate of Pratt lust.
and holds a lll-‘A degree in adver-
tising design and Visual (‘lrillilliilll-
cations. it is his Job to design in
collaboration with each lill'elJlUl',
all of the graphic art Work for each
production ()i the University Theatre
Season.

Glaxei', already with a great deal
of experience working within the
field of graphic ul'is, is very inter-
ested in doing further work in the

field of therapeutic art for emo-
tionally disturbed children. lie
worked in this area for the Kings

County Hospital before coming here
in State.

Positions important

The importance of the positions
that these two gentlemen hold, busi-
ness—publicity and graphic arts, is
not to be underestimated. It is the
goal of the University Theatre, es-
pecially since it is part of an edu-
cational theatre program, to do as
good a job in all areas of the arts
as possible.

This is a responsibility iliaitliea-
fl'cs have to lheii' audiences. \Vlth
ihc illlilliluli of these two talented
men ill the theatre staff we will
be able, hopefully, to achieve a
greater degree of professionalism
and artistry in [he final pl‘UilUi‘l
that you use an audience will see.
It is only ill this sense that the
term "professionallan has any
meaning in the theatre.

Good Publicity Mon

Like the good publicity man that
he is, l'l‘ﬂllkullls was careful to
inniniun that sale of tickets for the
forihi-uming production of "Lysis-
trata" will be available beginning
Oct. 19. While there will be no
season tickets this year, reserva-
tions for each performance can be
gotten 10 days before the produc-
tion at the box office, telephone
457-8592, The new location of the
box office is room 130, which, for
some reason, is locatediiisidc room
llu-l40.

“Where did you go?" on
“Whet did you do?"
These responses could accurately
sum up many weekend nights at
Istste. Since we've comeback this
semester we've come in contact
with many people, upperclassmen

 

so well as freshmen, who have de- ’
’ scribed their weekends in this do-

feetod tone which reﬂects the
apathetic attitude toward the dead
straightness of State.

Being a part of this college com-
munity, we'd like to pry open some
sleeping eyes to the sights and
sounds of the spontaneous band
world, which is a needed contrast
to the cold concrete slabs of this
institution.

Series of Articles

We hope, through this series of
band articles, to give you an oppor-
tunity to vent your emotions, and
to have, in turn, an opportunity to
express ours.

The first set-up takes us to the
University Twist Palace, 109 North-
ern Boulevard (don't panic, we
haven't seen any knives around there
lately), where the Sundowners-
“Tony Dee on drums, Eddie Burton
on rhythm guitar, Mike Daniels on
lead, and yours truly, Don Burton”-

are playing this weekend. Fame ‘

came to these mop heads over a
year ago at Spagma’s in Lake
George.

Since then, this extremely tal-
ented band has been to California
and back, playing with such per-
formers as the Rolling Stones, the
Dave Clark Five, and the Righteous
Brothers. They are presently on
tour after the filming of M.G.M.'s
“Don’t Make Waves" and the rel
cording on Filmways Records of
"When the Sun Goes Down" b/w
“Ring Out Wild Bells.”

Rongi: at Performances

The range of their performances
is as great as the distance they’ve
covered in the past year. Whether
they are beating out the popular
Beatles and Stones numbers or are
soulfullzing to James Brown and
Sam Cooke numbers, the Sundowners
give to their audiences sounds alive
that can be felt and enjoyed.

On drums Tony Dee is nothing
short of phenomenal. With an innate
talent, his performances are almost
hypnotic. We found him as fascinat-
ing to talk to as he is to watch. As
for future plans, he informed us
that the Sundowners will be releasing
an album in November.

What does the immediate future
hold in store for these four fan-
iasiics’? We asked Tony where they
were going after the U.T. iiis re-
sponse? “To bed, i hope."

NOTICE
