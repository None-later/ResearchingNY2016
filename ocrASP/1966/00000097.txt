Maybe people realize their part in the
development of the new campus since spirit

ing degrees both the definite and
tentative plans lfor our activities
and every Greek feels just a little
bit more than he or she has before
about their particular sorority or
fraternity.

More than this, 1 for one, really
feel that i no longer belong to a
fraternity but I am as much aGreek
as I am a fraternity member. I can
see this same feeling slowly pone.
trating most of the Greek body.

There were some fine things that
yesterday’s Greek accomplished,
but today’s Greek will outdo what
has been done a thousand fold if
we continue to work with the same
efficiency 'that has keynoted the
semester to date, and if we now

have established a committee to

Mail Service Criticized

To the Editor:

Last year living on a new cam-
pus presented its problems, but
receiving mail wasn’t one of them.
Mail arrived in two or three days
at the most after it waspostmarked.
This year this is not the case. So
far, of thetletters lhave received,
the earliest that :has arrived was
five days after it was postmarked.

Talking with various students,
one told me he had received a reg-
istered letter four days after it was
postmarked and another student said
he received a special delivery letter

_ five days after it was postmarked.

This should not be the case.

I talked with Dean Mathews’ sec-
retary and was told that thistrouble
existed because the mail for 7,000
students and the staff was all sent
to the same address. The situation
.was being taken care of because all
the necessary help had been hired.

My next stop was the second floor
of Stuyvesant Tower. Here lwas
told that seven student assistants
had been hired to help with the
mail and that one out of four per-
manent positions to help sort the
mail had been filled. The other
three positions were unfilled be-
cause to fill this. position a person
must take a slate civil service
exam.

This exam was given last June
and the results still have not come
in. Why aren't more student assis-
tants hired? l was told that no more
money can be alloted to pay any
more students.

1 finally checked the mail-room,
a room not much larger than ndorm
room. This is so cluttered with
shelves, machines, and full mail
bags that a person can't move with-
out tripping over something.

The question i ask is why can't
the Administration allot more money
to pay, more students until full time
help can be hired? My second ques-
tion is why can't the mail be moved

to a larger room where the workers
will be able to have space so that
some of the congrestion can be
cleared up?

Sincerely,

Ralph Lewis

Purposes Amplified
To the Editor:

As members of the executive
board of Logos Popularil, we would
like to amplify somewhat our pur-
poses and objectives-so as to clear
up some of the misconceptions about
our organization which might have
been obtained from the October 7,
1966 article in the ASP about our
activities.

First of all, for lack ofa better
categorization, we are the Sociology
and Anthropology Club on campus.

We further find ourselves in the
unique position among campus or-
ganizations, owing to the nature of
the academic discipline with which
we are concerned, of presenting
ourselves to the student body as
an organ of concern for student
problems, both transitional and
otherwise. Sociology and anthro-
Pology have often been concerned
with the individual's place in the
community and with his culture.
Thus, the student's place on cam-
pus, and the problems arising from
that communion, are vital and auth-
entic fields for our study. Through
the media of sociological inquiry
and the scientific method, we aim
to not only supplement and compli-
ment the fine work that the ASP
and other student publications have
done in recognizing sutdeni prob-
lems by investigating them, but also
to train our members in the fine
art and methodology of scientific
inquiry into the saclnl world.

Thus we aim to benefit the nu-
tire student body if possibletlu'ough
the eventual publication of our ch-
iective findings in addition to the
increased knowledge and skill we
hope -to attain for ourselves.

Thank you very much.
Martin Schwartz
