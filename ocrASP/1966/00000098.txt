games, heads the rest of
the field of League I. as
AMIA action swings into
its second week of play.

APA, who was idle overthe week-
end, is just a half game behind EEP
as of' October 9. They are 1-0 and
are followed in the standings by the
Saris, 1-1, Stuyvesant Tower, 0-1,
and KB, 0-2.

In Thursday’s game, Potter’s of-,
fuss finally clicked and the defense
remained stubborn. After a score-
less first half in which the Tower
team seemed as equally tough as
the EEP in nine, Potter exploded
for 21 points in the final sixteen
minutes to clinch the second vic-
tory.

1n the third quarter with a de-
fensive duel in the making, Potter’s
Mike Drexel intercepted aJeffZim-
or pass, setting the stage for EEP's
decisive score. Potter's quarter-
back, Jim Curley, unable to find
an open receiver, ran through the

Tower defense for the touchdown. '

The Black and White added padding
to their lead with two more scores
in the final period.

In Saturday’s contest, an inter-
ception by Serf John Holuske and
the ensuing extra point proved to
be the key plays in the Sarfs’ 7-6

team unable to sustain an offensive

A mere three minutes later Sililo

er' Albany Dominates Game

The first period ended with Al-
bany leading 2-0 and controlling the
game. This pattern never changed.
Albany continued to dominate, even
through the fourth quarter when
Coach Garcia substitued very free-
1 .
y1n the second quarter State main-
tained control as halfbacks Tim
Jursak and Tony Glaser controlled
the middle of the field,and fullbacks
Dick Szymanski and Mike “Doggie”
Hampton broke up Brooklyn attacks
before they could even get started.

The Great Danes’ continued pres-
sure on the Brooklyn goal finally
resulted in a foul by a Brooklyn
fullback at 19:30. Maurice Tsododo
made good on the ensuing.‘ penalty
kick. .

Brooklyn Rallies Briefly

Brooklyn rallied early in thethird
period as Steve Newman scored on
a fast break goal. However, Albany
quickly regained the initiative when
at 12:50 Tsododo slipped by the
Brooklyn fullbacks to score on a
pass from Sililo. The goal was
Tsododo’s fourth of the season and
twenty-fourth of his career.

Much of State’s predominance
throughout the game was.due to the
fine ball control of the front line,
especially Sililo, Tsododo, and Get-
achew Habteh-Yimer. The State full-
backs also played a fine game re-
lieving much of the pressure on
the State goalies.

A statistical evidence of the dif-
ference between the teams’ play
is given by the fact that Albany led
in shots 37-14.

The State frosh dropped their
second game of the season to Sul-
livan C.C. by a '7-2 count.

Drop Isl Meet

In 18-431“: At Holy Cross

by Jim Winslow
The Great Dane varsity barriers experienced the
unusual phenomena --of defeat, as they were solidly

trounced by a rugged Holy

Cross squad, 18-43, Sat-

urday, October 8. in Worcester. Mass. Albany man-
aged to take‘only third (Joe Keating) and seventh (Bob
Mulvey) placesout of the first ten finishers.

The Munseymen hadonly
lost three dual meets in
their five year history be-
fore the fatal meeting With
the Crusaders. “It was the
poorest job,‘ teamwise.”
said Munsey.

Co-captains Keating and Mulvey
had times of 22:59 .and 23:33, re-
spectively, for the Great Danes.
Winning in fine style was Quinn of
Holy Cross with a time of 22:20
over the hilly, 4.9 mile course.

Following Keating and Mulvey for
State were Soph George Rolling in
eleventh place (24:12), Don Beevers
in the twelfth position (24:17), and
Grant Downs finished thirteenth
(24:30).

Mulvey Named

Bob Mulvey was also designated
Albany's "Runner of the Meet" by
Coach R. K. Munsey for his vast
improvement since the LeMoyne
Invitational. One reason for the
poor showing of State was the fact
that No. 2 man, Mike Atwell, was
hampered by a pulled leg muscle
and could only manage a fifteenth
place finish.

In the yearling race, the Great
Danes of the future fared no better

than 'xthe parent team, losing to a
superior Crusader team, 18-44. Art
DuLong, last year's fastest Ameri-
can schoolboy two-miler, finished
first for the Holy Cross fresh with
a clocking of 15:21 over the 3.4
mile course.

Jim Keating finished fourth for
the Albany fresh and was followed
by Paul Roy (6th), Bob Holmes
(am), Jim Czeblniak (12th), and
Charles Hart (13th).

“Poor Showing"

In commenting on the meet, Coach
Munsey said, “Without the sur-
prisingly poor showing of several
key men, the meet could have been
decided, either way, by a few
points.”

The varsity will travel to Rens-
selaer Polytechnic institute this
Wednesday for a triangular meet
with RP! and Siena College.

"They slaughtered us (Holy
Cross) but the body’s still warm
and we will definitely be ready for
our Wednesday meet with RPI and
Siena,” sald’Coach Munsey when
asked to comment. “We will still
have a successful season despite
his temporary setback," he added.

The Dane barriers are now even
for the year, having defeated Mont-
clalr College in a new campus meet
September 24.

ALBANY, NEW YORK
Collins Comments

On In: Shelters,
Parking Regulations

At the President’s Press Confer-
ence Monday, October 10, Dr. Evan
R. Collins announced that the Com-
mittee on Safety is presently work-
ing on several new parking regula-
tions.

  

As soon as possible residents of
the Alumni Quad will be considered
as commuters to the New Campus
and will be allowed to park in the
Cnmmuter’s parking lot.

The committee is also working on
a system to allow students to park
in the Faculty Parking Lot during
the weeknights as well as the week-
ends.

Bus Shelters
Collins also commented on the
construction of bus shelters, say-
ing they would be built as soon as
possible, if he and Clifton Thorne,
Vice-President of Student Affairs,
had to build them themselves.

Collins also commented on the
fact that no single large auditorium
was constructed on the New Cam-
pus. He explained that an accom-
modation of this size is usually
largely waste space during most
of the time, and that it was felt
this space could be put to better
use.

Ten Lecture Areas
There will be at least ten small
lecture areas provided in various
buildings which will equal or super-
cede the capacity of Draper 349.

He also commented on the fact
that there are two buses which run
on Sundy morning, andthat students
wishing to be in time for the R0-
man Catholic Masses should plan
on catching the first bus.

The Press Conference was at-
tended by only five members of the
student body, and only one of the
communications media on campus
was represented.

Besides two representatives from
the ASP, attending were two in-
terested .students from Central
Council, and one student from For-
um of Politics.

   
     
  
        
 
    
     
    
             
      
   

PRESIDENT COLLINS Spoke to sorority and fraternity members
Monday night about their role in the University.

Collins States Approval
Of Stronger Greek Effort

President Evan R. Collins as-
sured the University's Greeks that
the Administration is definitely in
favor of the Greeks on campus at
the Greek Reception held Monday,
October 10 at 8:30 p.m., in the
Dutch Quad Dining Room.

President Collins encouraged the
formation of a strong Greek or-
ganization among the Greeks, who
compose what President Collins felt
should be a “critical four to five
percent" of the Student Body.

He also remarked on the Greek
efforts to strengthen themselves,

and remarked that he hoped the'

Greeks knew what they were trying
to accomplish in this effort.

Choice of Interests

Although the Administration is in
favor of the Greeks, President Coi-
lins made it clear that if it ever
came to a choice of interests be-
tween the Greeks and the Student
Body that he would place the in-
terests of the entire Student Body
first.

Clifton Thorne, Vice-President
of Student Affairs, also addressed
the Greeks in an explanation of
the Greek progress since the first
sororities were formed in 1900.

He also dealt extensively with
the question of allowing Greeks to
maintain their own houses, stress-
ing the fact that houses were dis-
continued iii 1903 when the com-
munity, “in all regards began to
have difficulty seeing positive bene-
fits of the Greeks on this campus."

Housing Costs
Thorne also theorized on the cost
of building new sorority and fra-
ternity houses. He estimated that
each house constructed to house
fifty students would cost about a
million dollars, counting costs of
land, housing and finance.
lie stressed the idea that the
Greeks could, and should earn a
significant role in campus life by
exerting proper decorum and re-
sponsibillty in their actions.

Peggy Wood Joins Drama Staff
Actress Sees Role As Advisor

by Mark Cunningham

Miss Peggy Woodiscur-
rently teaching a Class in
“Styles of Dramatic Act—
ing” on Wednesday even—
ings at this institution.

Miss Wood, who received an Acad-
emy Award llollllllfllllill for her role
as the Mother Superior in "The
Sound of Music," was appointed to
the SUNYA Faculty after giving a
lecture last March under the aus-
pices of the Agnes lu‘. Fullercr
Chair of Drumatic Art.

"DIScusslng and Advising"

She does not consider herself to
be teaching so much as "discussing
and advising." She noted that when
she was making her career, it was
normal for a student to pursue in-
dividual study with one great mentor
for many years and to learn by or—
porlence in the trade. Now she
feels that classes are confronted

with the new problem of individual
study by students withthoir masters
while ill the some time maintaining
the class as a group progressing
towards similar goals.

Miss Wood feels that horprlmnry
goal here is to help students to
work “...to enjoy, to Work toliroad-
on, to work towards lilting their
whole fuelling of the great culture
that we have in the English Lan-
guage. The English Language is
rich in words and In style and it
must not he lost, as it is now being
lost so seriously. I don’t mean lhut
we should try to eliminate regional
speech or regional clocution, be-
cause they give flavor to speech,
but we must learn not tobo so sioven
and so disrespectful of this extra-
ordinarily bountiful language."

Lost Language
She went on to say that “...tha
English Language is being lost he-
causc people don't pronounce It
properly. They don’t say vowols
or consontants, they slur things to-
gether or drop the end of the sen-

tence so you don’t know whatthey'i'e
saying or else they use a lot of
boinbast.

ment in the general speech of the

Language, which is sorlchin words,
to express the exact degree of

whatever that you want, and it is
your business to find that word,"

Commenting on the new campus
Miss Wood said that she was "...
overcome by the new campus. This
is like being in Athens while it
was being built. it’s so glorious,
I think people will be coming from
all over the world to see it."

universiinets Telethon

For Mental

Health

A titanic plan for an all-University produced tele-
thon to raise funds for the NewYork State Association
for Mental Health has recently beeninitiabed. Although
the plan is still extremely tentative, everyone who has
been approached has been helpful and optimistic. The

foundation has been laid,

The basic simple idea
was suggested by John Fo—
tia, almost in jest, but it
was immediately taken
seriously by Jeff Mishkin
and Ed Lange.

Since the initiating of the idea,
about two weeks ago, the afore-
mentioned three students have been
planning, and approaching people
who hold influential positions.

Feasible Prospect

The plan has now grown into an
exciting and extremely feasible
prospect. A basic steering com-
mittee has been established, with
five students: Ed Lange, John
Foila, Jeff Mishkin, Bill Cleve-
land, and Ray Clanfrini; there are
also five faculty members on the
committee whose names are being
withheld until the first formal meet-
ing of the ten.

Last Monday, four members of
the committee held an hour long
meeting with Mr. Claude Price,
Executive Director of the New York
State Association for Mental Health.
Mr. Price made it clear that before
any further work could be done, he
would have to secure the official
sanction of the Association’s Ex-
ecutive Board. This Is a relative
formality.

Mr. Price seemed very pleased
with the plan, and offered what will
undoubtedly prove to be invaluable
that an honorary sponsoring com-
mittee of famous persons from gov-
ernment, show business, and com-
munications for reasons of influ-
ence.

Steering Committee
Through his organization, he feels
that he will be able to give the
steering committee much assistance
in obtaining these people. The se-
curing of a professional advisory
committee was also suggested by

and planning has begun.
Mr. Price. The purpose of this
group will he to aid in the aspects
of production.

The basic plan of organization
consists of those two honorary com-
mittees; the head and controlling
steering committee, and a produc-
tion committee, a business com-
mittee, and a publicity committee.
These undercommittees, and their
subcommittees will each be re-
sponsible to the steering committee.

The steering committee will both
daily contact with Mr. Price until
next week when the entire committee
will meet with him and begin formal
concrete planning.

Complete Support

Complete University support,
from both students and faculty will
be needed for the successful plan-
ning and production of the'telethon
which is tentatively slated for Spring
1967. Performing talent, technical
work, business, and publicity will
be nearly completely handled by
members of the University com-
munity.

All fraternal groups, clubs, and
other organizations should contact
members of the steering committee
to offer assistance.
