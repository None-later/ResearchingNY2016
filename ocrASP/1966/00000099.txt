EVELAND AND ABRAMO attended a leadership con
stkthe State University College at Brockport last week.

Cleveland, Abromo Attend
SUNY leadership Council

by Sue Sommartana

A student leadership conference,
held at the State University College
at Brockport on October 5 to 8,
was attended by representatives
from Albany State.

Participating along with the dele-
gates from each of the State Uni-
versity’s other units, were Clifton
Thorne, Vice-President of Student
Affairs; Dr. Clam Tucker, who will
sit on Central Council this year as
a faculty member; William Clevel-
land, and Vincent Abramo, Presi-
dent and Vice-President, respec-
tively, of the Albany Student Asso-
ciation. ,

The aim of the conference, as ex-
pressed by Samuel B. Gould, Pres-
ident of the State University of New
York, was the formation ofa state
organization that would act as a
"sounding board" for student opin-
ion.

Difficulty Arose

He felt that a communications
center serving all of the State Units
was necessary. However, aproblem
arose as many of the students pres-
ent apparently misinterpreted Dr.
Gould’s proposal.

They believed that by urging a
new state organization he meant to
downgrade the importance of the
existing state associations; namely,
the Conference of Student Govern-
ment formed by the four year coi-
leges, and ClSGA which serves the
two year schools.

Bill Cleveland commented that the
direction of the conference was lost
as the main topic of discussion be-
came confusing and vague.

New Organiration
lie realized that Dr. Gould didnot
favor disbandlng the present state-
wldc student organizations. instead,

he merely wished to explore the
possibility of a new association to
serve as a focal point in bettering
intro-state communications.

The bright side of the conference
was the realization of the need for
an organization for the State Uni-
versity Centers at Buffalo, liar-
pur, Stonybrook, and Albany.

Bill Cleveland favors suchamove
as it would join members of the
State System that faced similar
problems; notably, the building of
new campuses and the ever-increas-
ing student bodies.

Group Association

Bill is also in favor of the for-
mation of separate associations for
the State Community Colleges, the
four year colleges, and the various
each unit of the State University
would belong to a group that had its
particular problems in mind.

The acclaimed film “Jules and
Jim" is this week's presentation
of the International Film Group.

One of the most popular prod-
ucts of the French “New Wave,"
it has been called by Pauline Kael,
“one of the most beautiful films
ever made, and the greatest motion
picture of recent years."

The film captures the peculiar

as individuals,
Greek groups are more than active
in all facets of student government.

He felt there are five goals which
.the Greeks should work toward in
Order to achieve greater inter-
Greekunity.

He listed these goals as: increased
Greek activity as a whole, a new
system of Pledge Education, getting
more Greeks into the subordinate
levels of student government, in-
creased support of IFC, lSC, and
Pan Hellenic Council, and holding a
more complete fall rush.

Joe Nicastri, President of IFC
and Chairman of Pan Hellenic Coun-
cil, wound up the reception with a
review of the aims of Greek Week.

Selective Service Schedules
Draft Exam Nov. 18,19

The Selective Service Student
Draft Deferment Examinations will
be administered once again on Fri-
day, November 18, and Saturday,
the 19, on Campus locations.

Friday’s test will be given in the
morning at Draper Hall in Room
349, while the second day’s testing
will be held on the New Campus in
Lecture Room #2.

The exact times are yet to be
announced. If there is a large turn-
out, the overflow will be sent on
Saturday to Hackett Jr. High in Al-
bany.

Application Form 5

Application forms for the test
may be obtained at the Registrar’s
Office, the Counseling Service in
Paine Hall, and at Dean Chessin’s
office.

These forms should be mailed
by the applicants to the Selective
Service Board, who will in turn,

send them all the necessary infor-
mation. There has been no deadline
announced as of yet, but it will be
posted in the ASP as soon as it is
available.

As to whether or not one should
apply for the test is determined by
each male student’s rank in class,
and the requirements of his local
Draft Board.

Standards

The stand which is generally ac-
cepted as to who should take the
test is if the student is in the lower
half of the Freshmen Class, the
lower third of the Sophomore Class,
and the bottom quarter of the Junior
Class.

Age has an influence when con-
sidering the test, but this again de-
pends on the local board.

A special note shows that grad-
uate students are expected to score
substantially higher than the under-
graduates.

ALBANY srt‘ib'e‘rt‘r‘  ifs;

by Ken Bernstein

Several State students forsook
personal pleasure on a beautiful
warm Sunday afternoon to demon-
strate on behalf of a man who was
spending the weekend in the Albany
County Jail with no bail set.

The imprisoned man was George
Bunch, a‘professor of Sociology at
Russell Sage College and a social
worker at the Trinity Institute.

Mr. Bunch was arrested on Fri-
day, Oct. 7 for a incident that oc-
curred on Oct. 4, when Mr. Bunch,
working at the institute, went to
investigate the cause of some noise.

Upon investigation, Mr. Bunch
found some young children, one of
whom called him "Blackie." Mr.
Bunch slapped the girl, but later
that evening visited her parents.
He founder her parents understand-
ing and helpful, but a few days later
they swore out a warrant for his

so was George Bunch.

George Bunch delivered a lecture
on behalf of the Freedom Council
in Brubacher Hall Monday evening
after being released earlier that
day. In the event he was still in
jail, Leon Van Dyke, a founder of
"The Brothers" was to speak.

The demonstration itself, held
on the steps of the State Court of
Appeals Building was well organ-
ized and peaceful. After a rela-

tively brief march back and forth
in front of the courthouse, the crowd
of about 150 persons sang the well-
known songs of the civil rights
movement. Following that, a num-

ber of speakers, including some of
the students from State, gave brief
speeches. '

There were two Albany Police-
men on the scene, but they were not
needed at any time.

Student Guidelines
Qescribes Regulations

The first shipment of “Student
Guidelines" has been received, and
is now being distributed. However,
due to lack of copies, they probably
will initially be distributed on a one
to a room basis.

This pamphlet is designed to fa-
miliarize the student with the rules
and regulations of the University.

As additional copies are received,
they will be made available to all
students. '

Copies of “Memo from Minnie”
have also been received. This hand-
book for women students is being
handed out to all womens' residen-
ces.

Those women living off campus
may obtain their copies in the off-
campus housing office, in Ryckman
llall.

The purpose of this publication is
to inform all women students of
housing regulations pertaining to
them.
