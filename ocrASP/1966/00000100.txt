Co-Cliairman Term Weekend
'Bigger And Better’ior ’66

Homecoming ’66 Co—
Chairmen Kileen Tracy and
Frank Petrone have com—
.bined efforts this year to
promote and expand the
concept of the annual
Homecoming events.

Six months of planning and pre-
paration have resulted in several
major changes in the procedures
and schedule which the weekend
involves.

Evening entertainment in the form
of a jazz concert by Stan Getz is a
sharp contrast to last year’s Ian
and Sylvia performance which was
held in the afternoon on Sunday as
the final event of the weekend.

An increase in the number of
ﬂoats entered in the traditional
Saturday afternoon parade has been
a tangible sign of the expansion of
Homecoming ’66. Last year’s en-
tries numbered eloven; this year
the parade will include over 20.

Groups submitting entries iiicludo
the 14 Greek organizations on cam-
pus, the freshmen and sophomore
classes, the Alumni Quadrangle,
the Dutch and Colonial Quadrangles
and the Commuters Club.

Faculty Float Planned

A float sponsored and operated
by the facility has also been tenta-
tively planned.

A new procedure for the selection
of Homecoming Queen also has been
put into effect. In previous years,
the selection was made by a panel
representing the faculty and student
members of the University.

This year's co-clialrmen felt that
the panel selection overemphusized
the qualities of speech, poise, and
maturity undervalulng attributes
such as personal appearance and

physical beauty.

This year's procedure involves

both panel judging and direct elec-
tion by all Student Association mem-
bers. A panel of seven judges se-
lected 12 candidates from over 40
as semi-finalists. -

The finalists, including the queen

and five' court members, were then
chosen by popular vote of the stu-
dent body. “The combination of
these two procedures," stated Miss
Tracy, "insures the selection oia
candidate equally competent in all
categories."

Court's Membership Increased

The number of members in the
queen’s court has been increased
from four to five because of the
formation of an added fraternity on
campus. Traditionally, the court
members are escorted by the Uni-
versity’s fraternity presidents.

Perhaps the most essential change
in Homecoming has been its relo-
cation at the new campus. This was
a natural result of the university-
wide transition and will allow a
larger segment of the student body
to be directly involved.

    

   
   

 
    

   

raﬂier well. The parade and soccer
game will be better because they
are more centralized. This is be-
cause they are on the newcampus.”

Jeanne Maurer, Malborough,N.Y.
Major: French. "it's wonderful!
It’s blossomed out to quite an event
for the university." About student
support she commented, “There
must be or we couldn't do so much."

Stephanie DeSimone, Glovers-
ville, N.Y. Major: English. “This
is the first year i've had anything
to do with it. i’ve been home or
.away. It seems they’re making of-
forts to improve it; to make better.
There is still a lack of support
towards the dance. They're notsup-
porting this the way they might
support some other event."

Mickey Noble, Seneca Falls, N.Y.
Major: Math. "1 think that the
concert along with the dance will
be an enjoyable weekend. I think
the students feel that they have a

bigger part. There is more inter-
est, but i don’t know why.”

Flo Riegelliaupt, Suffern, N.Y.
Major: French, Spanish: i feel the
selection of the Homecoming Queen
and tier court for 1966-67 is agreat
improvement over last years. A
Homecoming Queen should be the
choice of the majority of students."

Sue Wade, Sidney, N.Y. Major:
History. “Homecoming, and espe-
cially the selection of the queen, is
drawing more interestfrom the gen-
eral student body as more people be-
come directly involved. All students
have a direct voice in choosingtheir
representatives.
