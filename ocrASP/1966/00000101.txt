Last Monday night a large delegation
of Greeks turned out to hear President
Collins and Vice-President Thorne ad-
dress them on the position, history, and
future of fraternities and sororities on
thiscampus.

What they returned with was a vague
notion that somehow the administration
was really behind them and that to build
a frat house for 50 men would take noth-
ing less than a million dollars. It was
a disappointing affair, to say the least.

To the best of our knowledge. this is
the first time the Greek student body was
ever addressed by the top officials in
the administration. What everyone ex-
pected was for President Collins or
Vice-President Thorne to constructively
criticize the Greek activity on campus
and then lend their full-fledged support
to this organization which sorely needs
help.

Instead, they received statistical in-
formation about the trouble Greeks have
experienced in the past, their problems
of the present, and a sharp reminder
that Greeks could have been done away
with long ago if the notion ever so struck
our president.

The Greeks know that they’re not a
strong group, they know that they have a
lot of work to do if they ever want to
become a really powerful force in this
University, they know they need help.
Thus the administration was called in
to give them some concrete ideas.

Instead of getting the direction they
were looking for. the Greeks found them—

selves referred to as “neatly decorated
packages” -- with the administration
concerned with what’s inside.

This meeting was the time for the ad-
ministration to tell the Greeks what they
are looking for in this package.-It was
an opportinity wasted.

‘Memos’ Needs Revision

An article in suppression last week

concerning the regulations in Memos
From Minnie about women in men’s
apartments received widespread com-
ment. Even the administration admits
that the rule is “ridiculous and unen-
forceable . ”

Memos From Minnie contains many

such old-fashioned rules that are a
vestige of former times. There is a
movement to reform women’s hours and
weekend permissions which should be
further encouraged to speed the process.

There are, however, other reforms

which should be made. Although the ad—
ministration realizes that changes must
be made, they are not going to initiate
the action. The administration

and how reforms should be provided.

F?

by Joe Nicoetrl

Well, ladies and gentlemen of the,
Greek Organization, the word is
"Gel" This year, for the first time,
you have heard from the adminis-
tration, you have heard from Cen-

small extent, neglected. Part oiwhat
is bothering me is that, I am as
guilty as any one else of my own
accusation.

Work on Project-

I have been hoping that as we all'

tral Council, and, although you have start to' work together on each of
been hearing from me, you have our projects, that a single idea
heard us all at a single'meeting of would be evolved. l have hoped that

all the members of Pan-Hellenic.

Dr. Thorne said We at one time
had a package of goods for sale,
but through our own negligence we
have let the package slip from our
hands, fall, and nearly become
trampled under the onslaughts of
new, and perhaps more attractive
ideas and activities provided by
the new University.

Social Sell-Pity

President Collins said that we
have finally decided, after along
period of inertia and social self-
pity, to present the new University
with a spanking-new package and
beautiful red ribbon of ideas; but
“What,” he asked, “is in this pack]-
age?” Bill Cleveland, as the prime
representative of Central Council
and Student Government, said that
this council, composed of both in-
dependents and Greeks is morethan
ready to help and to work with Pan-
Helienic in its endeavor to become
not only an independent part of the
new University in our ideals, but
an intrinsic part of it in our labors;
and I said that now since we know
that we are independent in ideals,
since we know, basically, what we
want to do, and since we know that
the necessary encouragement and
help is available, “Let’s Gol"

Diverse Activities

What has been bothering me very
much lately, however, is that al-
though we are on the move, that
we have planned and are in the
process of executing such diverse
activities as talent shows, Greek
Olympic Day, discussions by notable
guest speakers, committees to plan

more exciting and informativech

Smokers, to work in conjunction with
Freshman Executive Board, to raise

funds, to aid in the establishment of
new sororities, etc., and of course,
committees to plan Pan-Hellenic

beer parties (the first of which will
be an All-University Party on Dec.
9 with Wilma and The Dukes pro-

viding the entertainment), a real

set. of philosophies and purposes
behind those affairs have been to no

work and time put in together as
one Greek group would be self-
evident in that such an effort would

produce an unbreakable and irre-
vocable strength and unit among

the Greeks and within the achieve-l
ment of goals.

Please forgive my naivete. I have
neglected to realize that work alone
cannot produce an ideal, and that a
single idea cannot call for work.

What I now realize, and have ac-
cepted, is that the building of an
ideal must stem from a strong de-
sire within the individual to achieve
it, and that this individual must make
more ﬂuid his convictions and allow
them to flow into and beassimilated
by the various other members ofhis
group. Each chairman of each com-
mittee must deliberately seek the
purpose of his group and the philo-
sophy behind it. Once one has real-
ized this, he must then commute it
to the members of his group.

Cautions Synthesis

Once each person knows the
“why” of his work, then the "what"
will be more easily attainable and
will turn out better. As each effort
is achieved and as each "why" be-
comes a permanent “because,” then
a cautious synthesis of our accom-
plishments will, perhaps, present
to us "whys" nearly as tangible
as our “Whats.”

The' raffle has been passed by
Central Council and we await the
ﬁnd] “go ahead” from the Uni-
versity Attorney. The choice of
items to be raffled will be a Honda
50 or a luggage set of comparable
value.

The talent show, open to the en-
tire University, is tentatively sched-
uled for Dec. 10. Each sorority and
fraternity is required to provide at
least one act for a limit of 10
minutes. These acts will be judged
by a panel composed ofindependents
and faculty members and the win-
ner will receive a very unique prize.

I The STATEment

by Sherman Richards

In this tale, we have three little
pigs who lived in the land of the
great while towers.’l‘hey were fairly
normal pigs, going to school most of
the week and relaxing on the week-
ends. Each pig, though, was very
different in her opinion about boy
pigs. Molly liked just aboutanyihlng
in punts; Millie wasn’t interested in
the opposite sex yet; and Elllcdidn’t
cure one way or the other about
pigs in pants.

The Proclamation

One day the noble and lofty king
of the land of the great white towers
proclaimed that he was going to
give a massive ball in honor of
his son’s return, it sort of home
coming. As could be expected the
three pigs reacted to this very
differently.

Molly got very excited about the
ball and immediately started think-
ing about which pig she was going
to get to ask her.

Millie would have liked to go to
the bail because of all its splendor,
but she knew of no boy pig who
would ask her.

Ellie was indifferent to the whole
situation. She said to tho othersthni
she didn't care if anyone asked her
to theboil or if she accepted or not.

The event was magnificent, areal
ball. Everyone was dressed so fine-
ly. The guys were their best dark
mud suits, while the girls woi'elioof
length gowns. It was truly beautiful.

As it turned out, Molly went to
the ball, but she couldn't really
enjoy it. The pig who took her
wasn't first on her list, but she
went with him because he was first
to ask her. The pig who was first
on her list was there with some
blond pig she had never seen before
and this ruined her evening.

Millie stayed home that night.
She tried doing something construc-
tive, but she couldn't gather mind
off of the ball. She cried until the
other pigs came home.

Ellis was invited to the hull and
she accepted. The thought of going
didn't excite her nor did the pig
who asked her, but she was going
to go anyway. An hour after he was
supposed to pick her up, he called
and made the excuse that he was
involved in a car accident and he
had broken his two legs. This didn’t
face her much. She just took off
her gown and ended up watching
TV all night.

Epilogue
Unlike olher tales, it must be
said that neither Molly, Millie, or
Ellie lived happily ever after, but
only one of them didn’t care.

Possible v-lﬁluestions

Rise Front Telethon
I by Ed Longe

Because of the rather blunt nature of the announce-
mentjconcerning the somewhat fantastic plan of the
University’s producing a telethon, some clarification
is felt to be needed. The simplestway to remove some
of understanding—blocking haze is to present a few
questions which have arisen, and answer them in as
far as, present situations and progress allow.

HOW SURE CAN ONE BE THAT THE TELETHON
WILL BE PRODUCED? Though everything regarding
the production is still in the planning stage,.everyone
who has been contacted has shown enthusiasm and
a willingness to help. Both faculty and students are
eager, and several Greeks have offered any and all
assistance. Judging from this and from the positive
attitude of the Mental Health Association, which holds
much influence, one can be reasonably sure of the
successful completion of the plan.

WHAT TELEVISION STATION WILL CARRY THE
PRODUCTION? This is not as yet known. The Steer-
ing Committee is confident that after a famous-name
sponsoring Committee is established; that this work—
ing in conjunction with the Mental Health Association
and the University, enough influence will be had to

secure a station.

WILL ANY MEMBER OF THE UNIVERSITY BE

ABLE TO ASSIST?

Adamantly, yes!

To succeed

in producing such a momentous undertaking, the en—
tire University must be in full support. This does
not mean a simple apathetic verbal support either;
the plan requires active support. Furthermore, though
the plan is still tentative and the hoped for date of
production is not until spring, assistance is needed
now. The work is now in its weakest stage when too
much opposing pressure could cause its failure. Con—
tact members of the Steering Committee now to offer
your help and your organization’s.

ASSUMING THE PLAN DOES SUCCEED, WHERE

WILL THE TALENT COME FROM?

As in all other

phases of production, business, publicity, organiza-
tion, legality, and operation, the bulk of the workers,
in this case, performers, will come from the Uni—
versity itself; that is it will come from both students

AND faculty.

Galaxy Player’s ‘Tartuiie’ Foils,

   

nus“ Short 0i Expectations

by Joy Deonehon

“Works of art are of infinite lon-
liness and with nothing to be so
little reached as with criticism.
Only love can grasp and hold and
fairly judge them.” This is the
spirit I try to maintain whenever
I go to the theatre. I go to enjoy
myself, to be entertained and en-
riched. If it is a play that I have
seen or read before I am willing
to accept new interpretations. They
could even turn Dr. l-‘ausius into a
Christ and 1 would be willing to
accept it- so long as it was an
holiest interpretation of the script
and good theatre.

I cannot, however, accept as good
theatre the performance by the Ga-
laxy Players that claimed to be
Moliei'e’s “'l‘artuffe.” I shall not,
for those of you who were fortunate

Viking Impressive

An impressive Viking head and
sculpture entitled "Flight To Vul-
hallu" was submitted by Niles An-
derson. Valhalla, according to
Norse legend, was the hull of Odin
where the souls of Viking llui‘oes

of the piece and assures us that he

Without the redeeming exhibits
presented by the jurors, the show
would have been another in a long
line of traditional fare. Perhaps
the new ('ullipus will help to create
an environmenl where someone will
attempt the difference and have a
plnre to display it.

In illllllllUll lo the Albany Artists
Group Show, the Institute also has
on display some very intricately
carved Japanese Netsukes. These
miniature ivories were worn on
the bells and around the neck and
were used to supplemcnl the dress
of the Japanese. They are approxi-
mately two to three inches high

the amazing and without ﬂilfllllll funk

Recent 'Curousel’ Rehearsal
Promises Professionalism

by Ellis

On Sunday, l attended the first
general mceiing and rehearsal of
Carousel 'UG--ilie All University
Recepiion which will he held Octo-
ber 21 and 22 in glamorous Page
llall. Considering all the produc-
ions in which I have been involved,
I have never seen such a wealth of
anthuslasm, talent, excitement, and
Jrofesslonalism.

The theme of the production this
rear is a magical carousel which
vlll dominate the entire air of the
show. Co-dlrectors John Webb, of
the Statesman, and Diane E.Somer-
ville, of Di'amatlcs Council and

Kauilnon

numerous other organizations, have
put together a show which will long
be remembered in minds of those
who witness it.

The talent this year will range
from the rock and roll to folk
music, from old favorites of the
twenties to current Broadway hits,
from light comedy to grand opera.

A chorus has been added this

year which will do three large pro-
duction numbers. At the first re-
hearsal there was an unbelievable
amount ofeuthusiasm for these num-
bers. The chorus wanted to dothese
songs over and over again.

enough to have missed this per-
formance, go into a full description
of the play or the lumbering way
it was presented.

Responsible to Audience

Rather, I will say again that any-
one, iio matter who it is, flint gives
a performance with the intention of
calling it theatre has a responsi-
biliiy to his audience. This is a
responsibility to do the best he can
to make his efforts art, and art
will never come, It must be achieved.

It is very difficult to say where
a production loses its spark of life,
its vitality. Most often a mediocre
performance results from a com-
bination of many things which, each
in their own way, pull the play into
drudgery.

The performance Friday was not
without its lighter moments. There
is something about Moliei'e lhal
even a bad performance cannot kill.
For the most part, however, the
comic brilliance of the situation and
dialogues was (lulled ill a ('lithl of
uncertainty. The prmluciion showed
a lack oipreparationaml lheindlvid-
ual performers reflected this as
well as, in some cases, a basic
lack of talent.

The interpretation seemed to be
[but of a slapsiirk melotlrmnn as it
might be played by an aging Vaude-
villinu who was forced to more in
slow motion. ()nr- spectuhn' was
positive that they were doing some—
thing by liuiipnies- perhaps "ille-
flea.”

The intent of the setting was sini-
pliciiy, but the effect of the gold

distraction that was not especially

Ed Dahlstedt as the hypocritical
'I‘_a_rtuffe, Alan Jakeman’ as the _naive
husband, and Louise Heinmiller as
Oregon’s wife were not bad really.
They might even have given excel-’
lent characterizations to their roles
with longer tutelage under their tal-
ented director, Samuel Morrell. On
Friday, however, they were not
ready for a performance. This was
especially disappointing becauseGa-
laxy’s bill-of-fare is normally ex-
celleni.

We are a generation“ who were
brought up on an entertaihmfnt diet
of Ed Sullivan, "1 Love Lucy," and
Soupy Sales. We found a heritage of
Milton Berle and Pinky Lee already
in existence. While these criter-
tainers are good in their own right
and, though I have my doubts, may
be acceptable for television, I do
not think poor imitations of their
styles by those who call themselves
actors can pass for Moliere.

There is a flourish, a truly ex-
citing style that is required to carry
off ibis fast paced satire and I
found it lacking.
