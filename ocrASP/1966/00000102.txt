ity 'to ask

. ,swersv left us' with a feeling of great optimism.
',_ He told us‘that the procedure for the establishment
of football would involve his appointing a committee
to make a thorough study of the question, with that

’ committee, in turn, making recommendations in a

report back to the President. President Collins would I

then make his recommendations to the University
Council, the highest local governing body to this
University, and they would make the final decision on

when and how a
this campus.

football team would be formed on

The committee, the President informed us, would
take two or three months to make its investigation
and publish its findings. The best part about this news
is that President Collins said that he is very hopeful
of appointing this committee within this academic year.

If the President does take this step by the earlier
part of next semester, we hope thathe and the Council
will act swiftly on the committee’s recommendations
and make football a reality at State, the, sooner the

better.

The committee. by the way, is to be comprised of ~
a cross-section of the student body along with fac—
ulty and administration officials. ‘

As previously stated on numerous occasions, the
stumbling block has always been facilities. Now that
obstacle has been removed, we see no reason for any
further delay in bringing this program here. We sin-
cerely hope that President Collins treats this matter
with all the urgency we think it is due.

But while we wait for football to arrive, soccer is
still our Homecoming attraction. And based on the
play of our soccer team of late, we are confident that
the returning grads and undergrads will see a fired-
up and confident Dane team on the field against Pots-
dam. Potsdam is a perennial soccer powerhouse, and
many State fans can remember the 1-0 contest our
deposed Peds dropped to Potsdam in the 1964 Home-

coming game.

The Danes looked really sharp in last Saturday’s
win over Brooklyn College, with both the offense
and defense clicking together for the first time this
year. And in what had to be one of the greatest one-
man shows we’ve seen in a good many years, Maurice
Tsododo seemed to have regained his sophomore—
year touch in his three-goal barrage against Oneonta

last Wednesday.

The Danes are fast approaching their peak of per—
formance, and a good Homecoming win over Potsdam
could give them the momentum to register a fine

season after all.

Potter Club Paces AMIA Football

by Glen Sopiv

The two top teams in League I
AMIA football increased their leads
over the rest of the field‘ with
roughly contested victories. APA
extended its shutout streak with a
13-0 victory over winless Tower
and Potter Club brought its win
streak to three games in a 13-7
squeaker over the independent Saris.

ln League 2 action, Kappa Beta
thoroughly trounced the GDI's, 30-0,
and APA played to a 6-6 tie with
SLS.

The League I tilt between APA
and Tower was marked by extremely
rough play. Both teams played slop-
py bail and were unable to mount
an offense strong enough to dom-
inate control of the ball.

APA finally broke the scoring ice
when quarterback Ray Cianfrlni hit
on a fifty yard bomb to one of his
top targets, lilch Margison.

Defense Rugged

With only a six point deficit going
into the last quarter ofpiay, Tower’s
defense continued to play a rough
brand of ball, highlighted by sev-
eral interceptions of ADA passes.
Despite the tough Tower defense,
Clanfrini was able to find Gary
Torino in the open for another six
points and Mike Gilmartin grabbed
a Cianfrini pass for the final point
in the hard fought 13—0 victory. The
APA defense has now held its op-
ponents scoreless in two games.

The Surfs, hopeful of beating the
undefeated EEP's, went out to an
early six point lead when the bust-

ling Independent’s defense blocked
an attempted Dick \Vitkc punt and
fully capitalized with a touchdown.
John Haluska threw a 10-yard strike
to Mike Popiaski for the score.
John Klinger was on the receiving
end of the successful PAT.

Run by Curloy

A long run by Potter QB Jim
Curley early in the second quarter
put the league leaders in scoring
position. A 25-yard pass from Cur-
ley to Denny Wyckoff gave Potter
its first score, with the ensuing
PAT added on a pass to Mike Con-
way.

Near the end of the third quarter
Potter blocked a Saris punt and
wound up on the defender’s 30 yard
line.

After the teams changed sides
for the start of the final quarter,
EEP quarterback Ray McCloat, who
substituted for the injured Curley,
connected with end Dan Crippen to
put Potter in the lead, 13-7. The
PAT failed.

Potter meets ADA Monday in a
battle of the nndeieaieds.

Kappa Beta, fully utilizing eight
interceptions by Jack Jones and
Eric Evansburg, rolled to a 30-0
triumph over the hapless GDI’S in
League II action.

Les Kelln‘cl‘ and Roger Ferendo
both tallied twice for KB.

Both Undefeated
APA and SLS battled to a (5-6
tie, with neither team willing to
risk its undefeated record.
APA registered seven intercep-
tions, but could manage onlyaslngio
touchdown all afternoon.

its first victory as the Aggies handed
the young Danes their third straight
defeat, 4-1.

Coach Bill Schieffelin’s freshmen
scored first as Al Van Dyck put
Albany ahead — for a little while
in the first period. The Danes man-
aged to threaten in each period, but
just could not get past the Aggie
goalie again.

The team sparkled defensively
but Cobleskill managed to take ad-

twice in the second period and once
in the third and fourth periods to
put the game away.

“The team is better than the
record shows,” says Coach Schief-

council Session
Sees Full Agenda
ill Activity, Votes

by Ken Bernstein

The second meeting of Central
Council this semester held several
decisions and votes that could have
great effect on the student body.

Vince Abramo announced that a
list of all students illegally pos-
sessing student tax cards will be
composed next week, and those cards
will be invalidated. Mike Ginsburg
listed organizations who have been
granted permission to solicit, and
informed the council that forms for
solicitations may be obtained in the
Student Activities office.

Sollcltotlons Committee

All solicitations in the future will
be limited to Humanities 140. So-
licitations committee is prepared
to ask suppression to move its
operations into Hu. 140.

Who’s Who committee will meet
on Oct. 1"? to screen candidates.
Chairman Kathy Brown stated_that
she was disappointed with the amount
of applications, and did not feel that
the quota of thirty-five members
necessarily had to be filled.

Leadership Conference

Central Council's newest mem-
ber, Dr. Tucker, gave a brief re-
port on the recent leadership con-
ference in Brockport. At that con-
ference, Dr. Gould, president of the
State University system told of his
hopes of a state-wide student asso-
ciation.

Connie Valis, chairman of the
Student Ambassador Committee in-
formed the Council that former stu-
dent ambassadors will hold a panel
discussion open to all interested
parties on Nov. 6, and distribute
pamphlets and application forms for
a week thereafter.

Klaus Schnitzar announced that
starting soon students on the Alumni
Quad will be considered commuters
and be eligible to park in the com-
muters lot instead of the student
parking lot.

Art Kapner’s news was less pleas-
ant for the entire student body. Due
to circumstances beyond his control,
the University's insurance rate has
gone up from $28 to $84 for the en-
tire year. The rise in price is due
to the ,New York State Insurance
Department. Along with the in-
creased plemium come substan-
tially increased benefits, however,
and after a long discussion, Council
voted to back up the Solicitations
committee approval of theincraase.

Already Puld

Students have already paid $14
for the first semester, and will be
charged $20 for the second semes-
ter.

The new Torch policy, designed
to increase the number of ads and
the revenue from them, was ap-
proved by Council. Any person who
sells an ad for the Torch and com-
plies with a few other stipulations
can receive a ten percent commis-
sion.

The Internal Political Parties Bill
was the cause of a parliamentary
debate. The bill, which would auth-
orize MYSKANIA to investigate the
possibility of political parties for
campus elections found the Council
evenly divided. After adiscussion,
in which sponsor- Henry Made]
claimed that if nothing else, "it
will give MYSKANI‘A something to

Miss Suzanne Wade, a senior
nominated by Gamma Kappa Phi sor-
ority, was crowned Homecoming
Queen at the semi-formal dance

urday night. The six finalistsjoined
former queen, Miss Harriet Tuck-
er, to be viewed by those attending
the dance while Miss Klleen Tracy,
weekend co-cliairman, announced
the new queen.

After being presented with an
engraved silver cup, the purple
robe and the crown, Miss Wade
commented that she was “very sur-
prised" by the selection, but her
escort Joseph Mahay added, "I
wasn't."

Memorable nght

Miss Wade has won several con-
tests before since she was a mem-
ber of Central Council last year
and is currently a member of MYS-

Faculty Lecture To Feature
Dr. Burian 0n ‘Europe 1965’

The ninth Annual Faculty
Lecture will feature Dr.
Jarka Burian as the prin—
cipal speaker.

The lecture is on Tuesday, Oct.
18, at 8:80 p.m., in the Dutch Quad
dining hall.

The topic for Dr. Burian's lec-
ture focuses on “Europe 1965:
Theatre West and Theatre East."

and experiences acquired when in
Europe in 1965. While there, Dr.
Burian was exposed to the public
and academic theaters in Western
and Eastern Europe.

After the crowning, Miss Wade
appeared tired from the excitement
and stated that the suspense had
been building up for three weeks
ever since she was nominated. She
was happy but glad it was over.

Her sorority made the event very
meaningfull because of the moral
support and confidence which they
showed in her. The afternoon of the
coronation, the sisters of Gamma
Kappa Phi presented Miss Wade
with a dozen roses.

Method of Election

About the method of election of
the queen as opposed to last years
selection by judges, Miss Wade
thought the method employed this
year better because it allowed more
students to participate and caused
them to be more interesting in home-
coming weekend.

She had never dreamed of re-
ceiving an honor such as homecom-
ing queen, but she said she had al-
ways been excited for other people
who won similar contests.

Insurancollates w 
.With Benefit Increase _   

Student insurance rates
will be higher next semes-
ter due to an increase de-
manded by the New York
State Insurance Depart-
ment.

For the past several years the
rate has been $26 per year. Bills
for this fall semester, however,
quoted the rate of $14 per semester
which would be $28 per year. '

Insurance for the second semes-
ter will cost students $20 with a
refund of $8.00 for students who
do not want summer coverage. This
is to supplement the increase of
student rates to $34 for both se-
mesters.

Rota Approved

This rate was approved by the
New York State Insurance Depart-
ment with increased benefits under
the surgicalschedule over prior
coverage. No.1nsurance may be
written in the State of New York
without approval. of both policy and
rate by the Insurance Department.

The Massachusetts Casualty In-
surance had originally'offered this
coverage to the University at a
premium of $28 per year, subject
to Insurance Department approval.

When notified last May by the
school that their proposal had been
accepted, the Company, in accord-
ance with normal procedure, im-
mediately filed both the policy and
rate schedule with the Insurance
Department.

Approval of the Policy was given
promptly; however, final approval
was withheld pending examination
of all information relative to past
claims experience, loss ratio and
premium structure.

Considerable Delay

After a considerable delay in the
examination, the comprny handling
the insurance for this campus was
notified that the rate of $28 would
not be approved. The Insurance De-
partment ruled on the basis of its
examination, that this coverage may
not be written for less than $34 per
year.

In View of this situation, it has
been decided bv Central Council,

VOL. Ln, no.2?
To Riso-

the Solicitation Committee and Uni-
versity authorities that the follow- "
ing procedures will be adopted this
year.

The annual premium of $34 rep-
resents $26 for coverage during the
academic year and $8. for summer .
coverage. The University Business
Office will bill $14 for the first
semester and $20 for the second
semester with a refund of $8 to
those students who do not wish -
summer coverage.

Mr. Art Kapner is currently the
insurance agent for the University.
He has held this position for 20
years and explained the increase
as the inability of insurance com-
panies to absorb the loss rate which
has been steadily rising. .
