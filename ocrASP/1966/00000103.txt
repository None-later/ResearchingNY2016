This is STATE?

Insurance Increase

n increase in the student insurance
rates will take effect with the paying
of bills for second semester. Mr. Art
Kapner. insurance agent for the Uni-
versity, is not at fault. He merely rep-
resents the insurance company.

Of course, students don’t want to pay
more than they have to, but this insur—
ance benefits those who have it and an
increase in rates can’t be helped. Mr.
Kapner has represented a number of
companies who have provided the uni-
versity with insurance.

These companies have lost money be—
cause their rates were not high enough
to cover expenses. He commented that
last year the company paid back to stu-
dents through their claiins, 90% of what
had been paid to the company.

This 10% remainder does not leave
much for the cost of the paper work and
salries. of the company. The New York
State Insurance Department refused to
permit the rate of $28 to protect the
companies involved.

Students are being offered increased
benefits and still will be able to obtain
an $8 refund if coverage is not wanted
for the summer. They should realize
that this increase is necessary and pay
it with an idea of concern of the in-
surance company involved.

Administrative Snirit

Amongst the excitement, parading,
cheering, and festiveness of last Week—
end’s Homecoming celebration one thing
was sorely missing--our president’s
presence.

While this may seem a picayune cri-
ticism, we feel that any all—university
activity as big as Homecoming cannot
become as popular and as unifying as
intended if the school’s top official, or
his representative, is missing.

Perhaps President Collins does not
enjoy soccer. All the more reason for
football to be brought back to State. Or
perhaps he does not enjoy sports at all.
Certainly some administration official
could act in his place, then, and give
the game the “official” support it de-
serves.

Homecoming is the perfect time for a
university to proudly display itself to
alumni and the outside community as
a truly vital force in society. It is the
perfect time for a university to show
its internal strength via a spirited parade
and a well-attended soccer game.

_ Without the president, it can hardly
be so. The school leader must be there
to show that strength.

Bookstore Contest

The State University Bookstore is of-
fering $50 for the best caricature of the
Great Dane that is drawn for them. The
Bookstore has had little response from
students although it seems many should
want $50 for merely drawing.

There must be many students who have
a little artistic talent and could draw
this mascot with no trouble. The book-
store is trying to help out the students
with the contest but students are not
helping the bookstore.

More enthusiasm Could be shown, if
not for the cause of spirit, then for the
$50.

 

by Joe Nicastri

The Greeks have taken a long
time in realizing one thing. We've

,realized that we were lost. It was

only with this discovery that we've
been able to find our way.

I don’t mean to'say that each
group has been standing in one
place, nor do! mean that we haven't
succeeded in gaining some of our

goals.
What 1 do mean to say is that
each group had semi-defined its own

,‘direction by a particularly vague.

goal and, when we approached some-
thing resembling it, we were fooled-
by our lack of objectivity into think-
ing we‘had achieved it.

Diverse Alma

Now these directions and half-
achievements were so diverse that
we placed ourselves in a maze of
intersecting, but unconnected di-
rections, and in a conglomeration
of partially-achieved, but uncom-
mon goals. Thus inertia.

Again I repeat: we realized that
this was our situation; we realized
that we were ﬂoundering; we real-
ized that we had better find a way
out, together.

I know we’ve done this, but I also
know that, although we are moving
in a single direction and, with this
security, we are able to reach out
and become a real part of many
aspects of the University which
we’ve before only dared to dream,
we remain unsure of our final goals.
But, and I consider what I am about
to'say a very fortunate paradox, I
wouldn't rather see us at this time
in any other position.

ggj'. , oily, October is, m.

   Pan-Hell Ration '

This time is Fall Rush. We are
all looking forWard to either filling
our quotas or gaining a formidable

pledge class. And of course, we're

all looking forward to a lot of fun.

But along with looking toward the
day when bids are accepted, we are
looking very carefully into whom-
ever we think merits a bid.

For this year, it is not so much
what ,thg group can do for the
rushee, but what the rushee can do

~ for the group. Thisw is why I feel

that we are exceedingly fortunate
in our position.

Period of Change

Each rushes knows that we are
in a period of change, and each
knows that he or she is going to
have a big job ahead of him once
he receives his bid.

We know, more than they realize
that although we’re moving together
toward tomorrow, we're taking a
lot of yesterdays along with us and
we need the people who only know
the tomorrow, because, although
they can see our yesterdays, and
see them objectively, they cannot
become a part of them.

New Material
The rusiiee will provide us with
new and strong materials to Coll-
struci our new Greek: he will pro-
vide new ideas, new concepts, new
philosophies, and enough new energy
to rejuvenate the old and carry the
whole system into a modern tomor-
row.
There will be no 15C or Pan-
Hellenic meetings this week. The

IFC will meet as usual.

A newly formed governmental
body, the Freshman Class Execu-
tive Board, is composed of ten
freshman who are interested in the
workings of class government.

At the first Freshman Class lifest-
irig, all freshmen were given the
opportunity to submit their names
to be chosen at random for mem-
bership on the Board.

Board Rotates

The present members ofihe Board
will be replaced at the end of this
month by icnotheriniercsied fresh-
men. Each month, until February,
when class officers are elected,
the Board will function as the gov-
erning body of the Freshman Class.

With the aid of the class guard-
ians, Laur Kurz and Jack Kenny,
the Board has laid the foundation
for many class activities.

The Beanie Beer Blast will be
held December 2 at the Polish
Community Center. The Class is

still searching for a band for this
event. Tentative plans are also being
made for a dance-party on Nov. 19.

Questions Urge
The Board feels that freshmen
may have questions about certain
groups and activities on campus.
Most freshmen do not Iiave an exact
idea of what Greek life is all about.

The Freshman Executive Board,
with the cooperation of the Pan—
Helleiiic Council, would like to in-
for'm freshmen about Greek lunc-
ticns and social life on campus.

In order to have a successful
presentation about Greek life, spe-
cific questions should be ralsml.
Freshmen with questions please cull

Aristophanes’

‘Lysistrata’-

To Begin November 2 "

The forthcoming State University
production of Aristophanes’ "Lysis-
iratra” promies to have a pointed
appeal to modern audiences, accord-
ing to the piay's director, Paul
Bruce Peitit. In rehearsal now for
performances from Wednesday,No-

vember 2, through Saturday, Novem- -

bar 5, “Lysistraia” is an antii-war
play which points up ihe futility of
war and demonstrates the author’s
solution for war.

The equality of women and their
role in war is also treated in the
play, but since this is a foregone
fact in modern society, says the
director, such matter becomes an
"archaic aspect" of the play.

War is Absurd
The play’s primary importance
continues Mr. Petiit, lies in its
statement that war is absurd in the
light of man’s ability to compromise.
Although "Lysistraia" is played in
a farcial, burlesque manner which

Upsilon Phi Sigma was given uri-
official fraternity status by Inter-’I
fraternity Council at its last meet—

raised Up Phi Sig from a Greek
“colony to a fraternity with full
voting privileges in the IFC.

President of Up Phi Sig, liank
Mueller, stated that they now have
all the advantages of belonging to
IFC, even though they only have
unofficial status. Official status will
be attained when they are granted
a charter.

IFC, however, cannot grant them
a charter until IFC itself, is recog-
nized by the Central Council.

would seem to lessen the play's
impact, these elements serve mere-
ly as vehicles for the author’s mes-
sage.

In spite of the play’s antiquity,
“Lyslstratra's” director feels that
no conflict arises in doing a mod-
ern production. in fact the complete
break which occurs by moving the
play from an amphitheatre to a
prosecenium stage frees the play
physically since the production is
not tied by precedent in design or
interpretation.

Avonr-Gordc

Consequently, while classic mo-
tifs will still be used in design, they
will be radically adjusted to modern
staging. In like manner costuming,
while not completely abandoning the
classical idea, will be updated al-
most to the poliit of being avant-
garde.

Tickets for “Lysistraia” will go
on sale ten weekdays prior to per-
formance at the box office in Hu-
manities 139. Seats for the Page

'Homecoming attracted a large
“number of alumni this" year, and
the main reason for such a large
turnout, was due, according to the
alumni interviewed, mainly to the
opening of the new Academic Pod-
ium.

Most of the alumni were over-
whelmed by the .new campus, and
used nearly every adjective avail-
able in what seemed to be sincere
praise of the evolution of Albany
from a small teachers’ college to
a full scale university.

Cecile (Pockross) Plait, from the
Class of ’40 called the new campus
“a vision.” She was amazed at the
change which transformed Albany
from “a tiny, little, homey, col-

Very Impressive

‘1 A representative from the Class
of ’51, Robert Umholtz, said“ove_r-
all, it's very impressive, but the
parking facilities leai'e a little to

be desired.” '
Comparing the University with
the Albany of thirty-six years ago,
Mrs. Florence (Maxx) Brody of '30
was deeply impressed with the works
of art and the planters in the U-
lounge. She made the comparison of
the campus as she knew it with the
new, “as a peanut on a pumpkin.”

Anthony Dlrocco, Class of '64,
has watched Albany progress
throughout the years, and now he
"looks forward to the day when Al-
bany ranks with any major univer-
sity in the country." He called the
design, tastefully symmetrical, and
he "hopes that the new campus will
create a greater alumni spirit."

Speechless
Al Smith ('65) simply called the
new complex “big” and was left
