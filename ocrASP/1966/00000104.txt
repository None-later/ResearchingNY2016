Harriers Decision Plol'lsliurgll;
Vie Willi New Poll: Tomorrow

byJim Winslow

Albany State's harriers continued
their winning ways as they swamped
a weak Plattsburgh team, 18-43,
this past Saturday at the laser’s
school. Joe Keating took first place
honors. .

Following Keating, whose time
was 24’21.8", for Stgte were Bob
Mulvey (24.25.5’) in second place,
Don Beevers (24'43”) in third place,
and George Railings (25’08") in
seventh place. Plattsburgh's Pete
Purdy was the only man able to
break into the top five for the up-
staters.

Coach Munsey described the meet
as a "letdown" from the RPI meat
of the previous week. "There were
several good efforts but no outstand-
ing performances," said Munsey.
The State barriers ran bunched and
with the breaks on for most of the

race because of the confusing 4.6
mile course and only let out in the
lastieg of the race.

The thinclads are now 3-1 for the
season with eight contests left to be
played. They will entertain New.
Paltz State on Tuesday at the new
campus course at 3 p.m. This will
be the fourth meeting'between the
two state schools in which Albany
leads 2-1. New Paltz inflicted Al-
bany's first loss in cross country
back in 1962. Since then, State has
compiled an impressive record of
35 wins and 4 losses.

The Munseymen will travel to
.New York City this Friday and will
participate in a quadrangular meet
on the following day at the famous
Van Cortlandt Park course. Their
opponents will be Adelphl, Rider
College, and St. Francis, which is
the host school. The Frosh runners
will be at Cobleskillxon Thursday.

nter forward Maurice Tsododo,

sophomore inside Yutulo Sililo and goalie Jerry Leggieri gained a thrilling. 2-0 vic-
to‘ry'over a previously unbeaten Potsdam‘eleven. The Great Danes were really up

 for the‘ game. and urged on by a tremeiido
‘finest game of the each, as they displaye

The first half was a well
played. evenly matched de-
fensive battle. Scoring op-

. portunities were few and

‘ v far between as both squads

displayed ‘stout defenses.
‘ Albany's best scoring opportunity
came in the first minute when a Pots-
dam fullback knocked down a ball
with his hand. However, the Potsdam
goalie thwarted Tsododo’s ensuing
penalty kick, and from then on the
defenses dominated. ‘

In the second half, howeven, the
Albany's potent duo of Tsododo and
Sililo started to click. At 12:06 of
the third period Tsododo took alead
pass from Sililo in full stride. He
dribbled to within point blank range,
faked the goalie left and fired the
,ball into the right hand corner.

Danes Increase Lead
- Then at 5:44 of the fourth quarter
Sililo worked open on the left side
where he took a pass from Tsododo
and deftly slid the ball past the
goalie to give the Great Dane a
commanding 2-0 lead.

For the remainder of the period
the State hooters dropped back and
played defense, and their play was
outstanding. Senior co-captain Dick
Szyvmanski played inspired ball at
center fullback, and Tom Egleston
did an excellent job of clearing the
ball from his left fullback position.

Leggiari Outstanding
However, the top defensive stand-
out was gcalle Jerry Leggieri.Jerry
accumulated twelve clutch saves,on
his way to an impressive shutout.
He showed both fine judgment in

determining when and when not to
dome’out of the nets, and excellent
agility in making several diving
saves. ‘

Another factor in this win was
Albny's ability to determine play
by controlling the ball,,Halfbacks

achew Habteh-Ylmer id an out-
standing job in this phase of the
game.

Sililo and Tsododo Lead Team

Once the bail got upfleld Sililo
and Tsododc were truly amazing.
Both dribbled as if the ball-were
tied to their feet, and it usualiytook
three fullbacks to take the hallaway
from them. Sililo especially seemed
to be all over the field making nu-
merous tackles, superb passes and
clever dribbles. ,

The State booters really-came
into their own in this game as all
phases of their game looked fluent.
The win was their third in a row
and evened their record at 3-3.
On Saturday they travel to Platts-
burgh in search of win number four.

Unfortunately, the frosb soccer
team could not join its upperclass-
men with a homecoming victory, as
the junior hooters dropped another
one - this time a 3-0 decision to
Mohawk Valley.

Good Mohakaalley defense com-
bined with State's rather disappoint-
ing inability to pass the ball effec-
tively resulted in the Danes fourth
straight loss. Mohawk Valley scored
twice in the second period and once
in the third to wrap it up.

The few times Albany managed
to maneuver near ‘MVCC's goal
area, poor passing precluded any
scoring possibilities.

Undefeated APA increased its
flawless record to three straight
wins in a run away game "with KB
last Thursday. The blue and white
showed no mercy as it handed KB
its third and worst defeat to date,
39-0. APA has yet to be scored upon
in 3 games.

APA captain and quarterback, Ray
Clnafrini, was in great inform as he
moved his team into position for
four touchdowns. Two came on
passes :to’ his great spilt end. Rich
Margison, another to tight end Mike
Gilmartin, and the fourth on a one
yard plunge by Cinfrini himself.

The other two touchdowns came
via the interception route. Gary
Torino picked off a Buddy Gates’
pass at the end of the let half and
went the distance on a spectacular
65 yard run. The other was scored
when Cianfrini jolted for 30 yards
with the pigskin.

KB, on the other hand, was faced
with problems throughout the entire
game. Their starting quarterback,

‘Playboy’ Conspicuously Absent
From University Library Shelves

by Sim Surnrn artono

There are many students wnobuvo
wondorod why “Playboy” is so con-
splcuonnly missing from the Uni-
versity's library shelves.

When questioned about this unique
situation, Miss Alicoliuslings, lioad
blbruriun, sold it is definitely not a
curse of censorship. The reason is
simply ihui the library has only it
'limltod amount of money to spend on
periodicals.

So, only those magazines that are

thought to help student research the

most are provided.
For tliosa who feel that " Playboy"
does go,hand in hand with class-

room studies, however, there seem:
little hope that it will become nvnil-
nblo.

Unless sonioono cores to donate
a subscription (which library sour-
ces say would be greatly appro-
ciutod) students here will continue
to be short changed in their cultural
pursuits.

The nude opinion on campus con-
cerning this oversight ranges from
indifference to disbelief that the
library does not spend money on
student relaxation as well as study.

interestingly enough, Miss llast-
lugs is in favor of ilugb Hefner's
creation. She said “i wouldn't mind
reading it myself."

Grad Students criticize

Dormitory Conditions

Several graduate students living
'in Sayles and Pierce Halls attended
the press conference with President
Collins Monday to complain about
their living conditions. Graduate
students live on the third floor of
these buildings while graduate

.school offices occupy the first two'

floors.

The main complaint the grad-
uates had about the condition of the
dorms was the filth. They stated
that the rooms had been dirty when
they arrived and still received a
minimum amount of cleaning. The
physical condition of the building
itself was also criticized. They
felt it needed paint and general
maintenance.

They admitted the problem pro-
bably stemmed from the fact that
graduate students had never before
fore lived on campus. They were
concerned, however, because the
grads realized that the University

is attempting to attract more grad-'

uate students, and they said a bad
impression is being made and they
would not be able to recommend
the school because of the way they
felt slighted.

Not only were the dorms dirty,
but there was no place for these
students to study or entertain guests
since lounges had been taken from
them. The fact that the graduate
students didn’t know where to turn
for help with their problems lead
to the fact that they have no gov-
erning body of their own and no

representative in Student Associa-
tion, but they must live under their
jurisdiction.

President Evan R. Collins and
Dr. Clifton Thorne, vice-president
for student affairs were both amazed
at these revelations and were anx-l
‘lous to quickly rectify the condition
of the dorms.

Albany State in lifts
BA liursin , Program
By Septem er’

A School of Nursing will be es-
tablished at the University by Sep-
tember 1007. The State University’s
board of trustees approved the pro-
gram to prepare candidates for
teaching, supervisory and admin-
istrative positions.

The Universitv will become the
third State institution to offer a BA"
program in nursing. it is hoped by
University officials that degrees
in nursing beyond the MA level will
be offered here.

The courses to be offered will be
in medical-surgical, maternity-
chlld care, psychiatric and public
health. The basic course work will
be held at the new campus. Ar-
rangements will be made to provide
area clinical facilities for the nec-
essary practical experience.

Tentatively, a student of nursing
will have to complete 120 to 185
semester hours in order to earn
a BS degree.

Burian Discusses European Theater
At Annual Faculty Lecture Tuesday

by Thomas Myles

“Europe 190.): Theatre East and
Theatre West" was the topic ofdis-
cusslon at the Ninth Annual Faculty
Lecture, held Tuesday evoninglnthe
main dining room ofthc Dutch Quad-
runglc.

Professor Jnrka M. Uurlan, of
the Department of Speech and Dra-
matic Arts delivcd an impressive
account of European Theatre to an
audience of over 150 faculty and
students.

The l-‘acurty Lecture has become
a tradition at the University since
the event’s inception nine years
ago. A member of the facility is
chosen to lecture on the basis of
mastery of his particular special-
izniion and his ability to impart his
knowledge upon a general audience.

Loavo cl Absence

Professor Llurlun was granted a
leave of ubsenco in won in order
to undertake a lecture tour through-
out Europe, with n lililjtli‘ concou-
lrniion of directing and lcrturing
of Prague, Czechoslovukla.

in his travels, he visited and
observed the lhontres of Poland,
idnglund, East and West Germany,
and Czecliosluvnklu. During histour
he witnessed more than one hun-
drod and fifty productions in us
many different ihouli'os.

The impressive factor of theatre
in Poland was the background pro-
vided by the counth itself. in a
country, where the animal drawn
vehicles outnumber the motorized,
and the national sport scours to
he illicit black market operations,
theatre flourishes.

Oliored College
English theatre-goers are offered
a collage ranging from the slick,
commercial, to the rich old standby
of Shakespeare. English productions

are similar in range of materials
to their American counterparts.

A long history of good theatre
leaves the Gerinanles with no pear
in modern theatrlcs, according to
Burian. "’I‘utonlc thoroughness" is
the key which enables the Germans
to hold the edge. Although Brecht
is very popular, a trend towards
the semi-documentary is per-
celvable.

In the tiny country of Czechoslo-
vakia, (pop. 14,000,000) fifty-one
ensembles produce over ’700 new
productions ouch your, 'i‘llcthcntres
play to over 75% capacity, but the
advent of television as a mass med-
ium of communication will cut the

attendance to a degree.

Paid by State

All actors are paid by the State,
the annual wage being an average
of almost 2,000 crowns, or $3,300.
This wage is only slightly above
workers in other fields. The theo—
tre is almost 80% financed by the
State.

Dr. Burton's lecture was fol-
lowed by a short question and uns-
wer period, and a reception. The
basic philosophy behind the Fac-
ulty Lecture Series is to "provide
additionnl intellectual stimulation
to members of the academic com-
munity."

JARKA BURIAN DELIVERS on account oi European Theatre to a
