Two unusual French films are

films, notably Fellini’s “8'1/2.”

“L’Atalante” tells the story of

the wife of a steamer captain who”

longs for the busy life of Paris.

An unruly crowd of about 200
youngsters waited impatiently out-
side Glffen Memorial Grammar

ing to pass time before the doors
opened. Inside the doors among
others, were seven Albany State

nvoy Program

Being Started

The Student Ambassador Program
is functioning this year. In hopes of
sending ambassadors from the uni-
verslty to countries in Europe sev-
eral projects have been started.

.-\pplications will be available to
any sophomore or junior who wishes
to become a student ambassador.
All applicants must iiiaintaln a de-
sirable average and he iii good
health. From those who apply the
selection Committee will select the
"ambassadors" for next year.

The ambassador committee will
collect European travel information.
it is hoped such a library will be
useful to any student planning to
spend some time in Europe.

It has been pointed otit by Miss

‘The Bouglaieu’ Music Group Offers
F renetic, Highly Captivating Music

by Germaine Caroselll

liave you heard of The Bouglaleu?
The Bougalleu is both a dance and
a band, but today’s article is con-
cerned only with the hand, a group
of thoroughly confusmg individuals
whose enthusiasm and eitcitement
gives their music a frenetic and
highly captivating life.

Parker Kennedy [Ii Is the lead
singer for the group. liis stage
personality is electric and inspir-
ing, sometimes ellicititig tears as
with his rendition of “Rising Sun,"
and other times provoking his auti-
ience to near hysterical laughter
as he does with his back-up vocal
on "Wild Thin."

Varied Llfo
Starting front North Carolina, his
varied life has led him across the

continent and back, dumphlng him
finally in Albany where he met
Michael Roihman, guitar-player.

Mike, a reformed folk-guitarist
and long-time reSident of Yonkers,
the home of P.O.I.P., can now be
seen plating lead guitar for The
Bougaiien every Thursday night at
the New Stadium Restaurant a Grill
on Clinton Avenue. ills guitar-play-
Ing lies completely in a blues vein,
but is elastic enough to stretch from
a rough and almost savage feedback
break, as in "flatter Man'l‘fiani,”to
a percussive “What Now My Love,"
and then further to a bitter-sweet,
soul-searing tenderness as in "Co-
rina, Corina."

Attending Juiilor College of Al-
bany and working with The Bongo-
lieu are Mike’s main projects now;
he's finally settling down after see.

Island born student at Albany Col-

ist, he started with The l’iougnliou

run 'by Stone students. However,
"Project Holpmate” is a long way
from being a complete success.
There were just for too many young-
sters wishing to participate to be
effectively handled by the' number
of instructors.

Activities In Gym

George Wallace, Tony Melee,
Steve Kliman and Joe McAndrew and
Mr. Saltreli helped out with the ac-
tivities in the gymnasium, while
Teresa Piegat and Janet Goodrich
organized some games in a game-
room. There were ‘other people
present, notany Mr. Robert Brew
of ABC and Giffen's Vice Principal,
Mr. Siepfien Deals, but all efforts
to get the youngsters organized
failed due to numbers.

Mr. Brew is of the opinion that a
school of Albany’s size should be
able to provide at least 50 men for
the project, and with that number of
fielpers, more activities having bet-
ter organization could he initiated.

From University '

Brew believes that college stu-
dents, even as young as they are,
represent sort of a “father image"
to the youngsters, and that this is
vital in many cases.

Just one ,look at the youngsters
would convince any skeptic of the
ravages of poverty. Some young-
sters come in with notes from their
parents explaining that they cannot
afford sneakers and asking them to
admit, the youngster to the gym
anyway.

Road to Success

Two weeks ago, about 250 kids
were supervised by only four people,
This week, about 200 kids partici-
pated, supervised by about 15 people,
so Project Helpmate is on the road
to success and fulfillment, but more
volunteers are desperately needed.

No recreational skills are neces-
sary to be a big help to these young-
sters, only some patience and a lot
of understanding.

as well as those of a student of
ancient cuneiform languages and of
Near Eastern tongues.

Study in Scloncos

The Albany professor eartied his
bachelor’s degree in clieiiilstry at
Temple in 1934 and went on to
graduate study in physics, physi-

By American College life

by Ed Kaz

Joe College of Stuyvesant Tower,
a major in Yozzi's and owner of
several, still virgin textbooks, won’t
believe it but--“The students inAl-
bany State, they study so much!”

This, sometimes not too appar-
ent, aspect of State students was
among several surprising observa-
tloiis of SUNYA made by Syrian
movie and television star and pre-
sently State student, Tijin Bla Nou,
or as Syrians know her--Taj Batok.

“Oh, you do study so, and every

Biology Outing Held In Rbude Is.
For Observation ill Marine life

The joliitly sponsored annual Bio-
logy outing was lield from Septem-
ber 30 through October in Rhode
Island. The venture, jointly spon-
sored by the Biology Cltib and the
Biology Department find as its pur-
pose the observation of flora and
fauna of marine and fresh water
communities to provide practical
experience for students.

The outing, headed by Dr. Mar-
garet Stewart, included loineinbers
of the faculty and 44 students. The
party left Albany Friday,Sep'lember
30, and stayed at Camp Fuller, a
YMCA camp in lthode Island. The
members spent Saturday exploring
the ocean front around Potter Pond
Bridge, Mlddlobridge and PolntJud-

ith Pond.

It observed many kinds of fish,
seaweeds, and marine life includ-
ing crabs, oyster and mussel shells,
starflsli, sea anemones, and a sea
cucumber.

Saturday evenlngwas spent around
a fire and a Hootennany was held.
Sunday, before beginning the return
trip, a pair of mute swans and a
curfew were spotted by the group.
lfhode Island was chosen for tile trip
because of its more southern loca-
tion and warmer waters, good for
observing seallfe this time of the
year.

The outing, on annual affair, is
open to all students in the Univer-
sity.

Another Comparison

Before rushing out for a trans-
fer application, read on as Tijln
makes another comparison between
State and her native school, The
University of Syria at Damascus,
where she manored in plillosophy.

“The boy and girl students, they
are together so much fiere, and even
after the classes. And on the week-
ends, even very new friends are to-
gether.” In Syria it is different.
Everytfiing is so much more for-
mal. We study together, but dating
is just not done.”

How about Friday and Saturday
nights? “Oh, the students study on
the weekends or go out to dinner
with their families. Syrian boys
and girls do not go together until
engaged.

Student Relationships

While you’re tearing up those
transfers-weed on. Even though
accustomed to very formal co-ed-
ucatlonal student relationships, the
actress-student admits she likes
the American way of college life
and guesses her Syrian school-
mates would prefer it too.

tress played the lead role in the
motion plctiire “The Dream’s Pal-
ace" which was presented at the
International Film Festival at
Cannes, France.

Legal ?
Against

by Victor Cohen

The Constitution of the United

' States (Article In, Section 3) states,

"Treason against the United States
shall consist only in levying war
against them, or in adheringto their
enemies, giving them aid and com-
fo'rt." . '
That the Vietcong is the enemy

' of the United States has. been at-

tested to many times by President
Johnson, Secretary of State Rusk,
and other high officials l_n the gov-
ernment. The Soutthetnameae gov-
ernment has asked for our assis-
tance in driving the lnvadeas from
the North out of their country.

Vietcong Sponsored

These invaders are the Ho Chi
Minh sponsored Vietcong. They are
not men from South Vietnam rising
in revolt against the government;
they are Communist-supported Ill-
flltraters whose sole purpose is to
place the South Vietnamese under
Communist control.0ur government
has decided to help the South Viet-
namese defend themselves against
the encroachment of their country,
by the Communist-inspired Viet-
cong.

Anyone who gives “aid and com-
fort" to the Vietcong is committing
treason. Sending blood to the Viet-
cong is an act of aid comfort to the
enemy; and it is therefore treason.
That the people responsible for this
have not been prosecuted is acrlmo
in itself. They should be tries and
found guilty of treason and receive
the penalty prescribed by law.

Better Penalty
A better penalty might be to send
them all to North Vietnam where
they could find out foi‘ themselves
how bad Communism really is. The
government there wouldn't stand
for their trying to send blood to the

enemy, norwouldthoy _ V _ j _

one, but also a moral one. By help-

serting their nongaupport of the
United States government. A can-
tradiction exists here - in I Com-
munist country one cannot speak
out against the government; here he '
can. v . .

By denouncing the United States
and getting away with it, he is ac-
tually asserting one of our greatest

Opening Lead: ’7 of Spades

This past weekend, Albany played
host to the Upper New York State
Regional, a gigantic tournament
sanctioned by the American Con-
tract Bridge League.

This writer partlclpated in many
of the events, including the open
pairs, but the most interesting hand
came from a small, one-session
side game. The West player was
also a student at tlils University,
but, for reasons of his own, wishes
to be known only as “West.”

From South's poliit of View, it
would seem that someone had put
a piiioclile deck into tfie board by
mistake. For the first round of
blddliig to occur, there should have
been some extra aces and kings
in the deck.

South bid three hearts at his
second turn, hoping North would
identify a spade stopper if he had
one, but West's bid prevented him
from doing so. South decided.to
trust his partner to take otit to four
clubs if he lacked the spade stop-
per and bid threo no trump anyway.

The opening spade lead was ducked
around to South's queen, and South
paused to consider. He could count
eight tricks, and a ninth was avail-

] in diamonds, if he had the tlino

and the entries to develop it. That.
was unlikely, so he decided to try
to get West to lead diamonds for
him.

The top clubs were run, West
discarding two diamonds, a heart,
and a spade, dummy 9. diamond, and
East a spade and a diamond. Then
a spade was led to dummy's ace
and a spade returned to West’s
king, Soutfi discarding a heart.

New West was on lead with the
ace-queen of diamonds and three
hearts. He made the best possible
return of a low heart, but South
took East's king with the ace and
fed back the jack. West was in
again and cashed his other heart,
but eventually had to lead from
his ace-queen to South‘s king-eight.
