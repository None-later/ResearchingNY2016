carousel ride, the themesong is
"My Carousel” performed at the
beginning of the show by co-chair-
men Diane Somervilie and John
Webb. The set will consist primarily
of a large carousel roof painted in
orange, black and white. ‘

1 Reception Promises
lbony Has To Offer .

0n the production and} of this
year’s Reception are many people
including Joyce Levy, stage mana-
ger, Anya Deinitzen, choreographer,
and Diane Somervilie and John Webb,
co-chairmen.

After three weeks of rehearsals
and an even longer period of plan-
ning, Carousel '66 looks like it will
be a long-remembered show.

To prepare the audience for the
show, the following note has been
printed in the program:

“We ask you this evening to sus-
pend your common sense and come
with us for a magical ride on our
carousel.

NowldoosAdopted,
Malia Talent Show
More Cohesive Unit

The All-Unlversity'Reception is
a long-standing tradition at Albany.
In the past it was an informal,
hastily prepared presentation of the
talents of the student body to the
incoming freshman class.

This year there have been some
changes made by the show’s cu-
chairmen Diane Somervilie and John
Webb. They have introduced new
ideas in both the kinds of acts pre-
sented and the format of the slit)“
to make it more than a simple
talent show.

As Diane put it, “We want the
reception to be a cohesive unit with
one theme throughout. The chorus
will provide the link.” Among the
new ideas are a chorus, which will
be doing two big production num-
bers, and three accompanists -
two pianists and a drummer.

In previous shows the acts were
arranged in type order, that is,
all the classical music together,
all the jazz together, and so on.
This year Diane and John have
mixed it- all in together in a way
that they feel makes for a more
smoothly-flowing show and which
they feel will better hold the, at-
tention of the audience.

In general Diane and John feel
very confident and excited about
the show. They feel it is the “best
organized and most talent-filled”
All-University Reception in many
years.

AT PRESENT Dudley Observatory occupies a worn and much-used looking building. In the future it

will move to a new structure on the University campus.

Dudley Observatory To Be Located
0n State University Campus

.In a few years Albany’s famous
Dudley Observatory will be located
on the University’s campus. Dr.
Curtis L. Hemenway, head of the
observatory has announced that the
relocation will be made as soon as
the ncessary funds have been ob-
tained.

For the first time in the history
of the University astronomy is being
offered as a major field of study.
Hemenway is the chairman of the
new Department of Astron'omy and
Space Sciences.

World Famous

The Dudley Observatory is known
throughout the world for the work
of Hemenway and his predecessors;

Dr. Lewrs Boss and his son Dr.
Benjamin Boss. While under the
Boss' direction the staff of the ob-
servatory spent forty year‘s tracing
the paths of 33,000 stars.

Today, Dudley is known for the
work of llemenway and his staff on
micrometeorites. Micrometeorites
are microscopic dust particles that
enter the earth’s atmosphere from
outer space. These particles are
collected by balloons, rockets and
the manned space capsules.

There is a theory that life came
to the earth via micrometeorites.
All the micrometeorites studied by
Hemenway’s team have been found
to support no life. These particles

are c0mp0sed of the same elements
We have on earth.

Electron Microscopes

" . by ,lpor Iforlult

The title, " 'Bout Changes Gr

Things" (Vanguard VHS-9200), ex-
presses quite weii the variety of
content found in Eric Andersen's
latest album.
, A singer-songwriter in the pure,
non-protest vein of folk music, An-
dersen remains relatively unknown.
His tunes and lyrics treat such
topics as love and freedom in a
pleasant or wistful, but never bitter
fashion. '

Straight Forward Style

His stylefis straight forward,
without any gimmicks. The only
innovation he has added in the two
years he has recorded for Van-
guard is the use of an electric
bass background in two songs on
this album.

The album begins with “Violets
of Dawn," a kind of free-wheeling
nonsense love ballad. This song has
been recorded by many artists,
including the Blues Project and
Judy Collins.

"Thirsty Boots,” another of his
tunes done by Judy Collins, isatrib-
ute to the civil rights workers in
the South.

“The Blind Fiddler" is a song of
pathos speaking out at the inhu-
manity found in the coal mining
industry of Appalachia. “You Been
Cheatin',” done in a lighthearted
fashion, is reminiscent of the style
of the late Buddy Holly.

In order to study these particles A

the observatory has two powerful
electron microscopes and a special
weighing device. it was at first a
problem to find the weights of these
microscopic dust particles. To re-
move this inadequacy the Dudley
researchers have developed a bal-
ance that has a sensitivity of
.000000001 gram.

The team of researchersincludes
graduate and undergraduate students
"from. the University and Union Col-
lege in Schenectady, N.Y.

Original Blue:

Elvis Presley fans will recognize
“That’s Alright Mama" as one of
his original blues recordings. A
patriotic ballad in the Woodie Guth-
rie tradition is “My Land is a
Good Land.” Also worth listening
to are “The Hustler," "i shall Go
Unbounded," and “Close the Door
Lightly When You Go."

Andersen’s voice and songs are
just beginning to mature. He has
borrowed ideas and styles freely
from others and woven them into

detached from Bill .

Is life on the new Albany campus
too confined? Is the new campus too
detached from the city, too complete,
perhaps?

Most students ‘shared the opinion
that the school is isolated, but
agreed that this insularity has both
good and bad points. Freshmen
Charlotte Vizzi and Iris Alson
pointed out that there is nochanceto-
see what is happening in the city‘
and elsewhere.

They add, however, that its iso-
lation is conducive to study."There
is nothing else to do," says Iris.
Desalise nearly everything the stu-
dent needs is on campus, Charlotte
points out, the student doesn't have
to waste time waiting for buses.

Remembers Lost Your

Junior Barb Psyck, who remem-
bers last year's buses and annexes,
likes this year's set-up better.
Nevertheless, she admits she mis-
ses the spread out campus ofchurch
basements and warehouses.

Another veteran of last year’s.
confusion, senior Liz Mulvey says
there is no reason to think of thee
campus as apart. If the student
really wants to do something, he
will. The student’s mobility, she
adds, depends not on the college
but on the individual.

On this point, Miss Tansky, aca-
demic 'advisor, agrees with Liz.
She says the school is not respon-
sible for providing the students with
community ties. 0n the other hand,
if the city provides the opportuni-
ties, th_e school should try to promote
them.
