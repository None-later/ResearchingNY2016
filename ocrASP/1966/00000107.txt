efends Language
To the Editor:

Mark Cunningham’s interview
with Miss Peggy Wood must not go
unchallenged.

Mr. Cunningham" do you mean
for us to believe she actually said
that’the English language was being
LOST (sic) because people don’t
pronounce it the way she thinks they
should?

That she charged 180,000,000
people with slovenliness because
they don’t say their vowels and con-
sonants to her satisfaction? That
she doesn’t know that no language
has ever asked or accepted advice
from scholars or would-be refor-
mars?

The statements you have attri-
buted to her are almost a Syllabus
of Vulgar Errors about Language.
If you know of one cliche, one “er-
ror of pronunciation," one mumbled
ending that has ever been changed
or removed from the daily language
of any people anywhere by school-
masters, please illform me.

That just isn’t how it works.

And while you’re up-- tell me
what is supposed to be the differ-
ence between the “regional speech”
which giveth flavor to "this extra-
ordinarily beautiful language” and
the udisrespecti‘ulness" you say she
wants us to shun? Is there any,
other than whim?

It is at best debatable whether a
standard stage language ilas any-
thfng to recommend it, but to speak
of “improving” the general speech
of America (like the Widow Douglas
“siviling Huck Firm") is pure silli-
ness.

7 Besides, who is going to reform
whom here? I find no difficulty in
understanding the people I meet,
thank you very much. if by speech
that has a choice oi words you
mean that ioathsomeiy gushy de-
scription of the campus: "It’s so
glorious."

I'll do without it. Speaking oi
choice of words-- if our (adjective,
adjective) English language has

words to give the exact degree of
emotion or color or what-not that
we want to express (and I don't
doubt it) -- then why was “bom-
bast" shoehorned into place as a
pronunciation error?

Check your dictionaryu-are you
sure she said that? Or are you, too,
"overcome" by the new campus?

Old Norse, .Geatish"and Anglo-
Saxon translations of the above will
be made available to purists at a
moderate price.

Frozen Fitness

To the Editor:

The unfamiliarity of arriving at
college and becoming adjusted to a
new way of life is a difficulty which
every freshman must face.

There are bound to be new rules
and routines which will surprise,
frustrate, or just plain infuriate
him. But in time he becomes ac-
customed to them, accepts them,
and forgets what life was like be-
fore them.

But one thing X as an individual
will never get used to is turning
into an icicle during gym class.

It’s hard enough to be physi-
cally active for a straight hour
when you’re used to a high school
gym class whose red tape cut the
time down to 20 or 30 minutes, but
having the freezing wind bite into
.you so early in the year is un-
pleasant and dangerous.

I know the reply--there is no
gymnasium and we, “just have to
make the best oi it.” But is it fair
for us to be penalized because there
is no gym?

No doubt we would go inside on
colder days if there were indoor
facilities available, but as it stands
now, we are scheduled to be out-
side until Thanksgiving.'Will the
voluminous costume of gym out-
fit, sweatshirt, sweatpants, scarf,
and gloves be enough?

I recognize physical fitness is
an asset for anyone, but it seems
to lne that there is a better meth-

 

The STATEment

A look From Above l

by Sherman Richards

"Step back boy, behind that white
line. You’re getting too close to the
edge......What’s that, you can’t see.
Well, you come back ill a few years
when you’re a little taller. Don't
worry, they’ll still be there when
you get back.

"Ladies and gentlemen, please
try and remember while looking at
these primitive creatures that they
must be thought of as and things.
They have none of the benefits that
our culture afford us. They live
communilly in what lnight be called
a state.

“This particular state was formed
in the year 7654 urbytheir calendar
in 1844. The animals living there
stay only for a short time.

The State

“Our investigators have told us-

that these animals are given fairly
rigorous schedules.Eachrlay at cer-
tain times they are given lessons to
memorize. Their feeding times are
somewhat regular. Abouttwice aday

they line up and wait for their turn
to feed.

"They are quite protective with
their females giving them a certain
time by which they must return to
their living quarters or they'll be
locked out. Not only that, but they
require their females to tell where
they are going, if they leave their
quarters at night.

“They give their males pretty
much a lot more TF68d0lll.'W9 aren’t
sure if that's because they care
less about the males, or they feel
males are more mature.

Humane Trootmont

"Now people, we shouldn't laugh
at these animals for even they have
feelings to some degree. We wouldn't
want to hurt their feelings or make
them conscious of their primitive
culture. If they seem crude com-
pared with us, it is only because
we've had more time to develop.
We estimate they will eventually
achieve a higher standard of being.

ASP Anti-Greek
To the Edltm:

Concerning the October 18, 1966
issue of the Albany Student Press,
1 am forced 'to bring to your atten-
tion the inaccuracies and deficien-
cies of your coverage on the 1966
Homecoming.

In my estimation, you have over-
emphasized some of the events while
misprinting and even omitting
others. First of all, the captain
under the prize-winning float pic-
tured on page three contained two
errors.

The fraternity on this campus is
Sigma Lambda Sigma, not Sigma
Lambda. Also, the name of the
sorority which tied for second place
in the competition is Kappa Delta,
not Phi Delta.

Secondly, the awarding of the
scholarship cups to the sorority and
fraternity with the highestacademic
average was not so much as men-
tioned in your coverage of last
week’s news events.

Presuming that this is an aca-
demic institution, 1 would imagine
that this awarding, which is cer-
tainly somewhat of an honor to
those concerned, would be deemed
"quality" enough news to beprinted
in your paper.

Perhaps, as you say, you are
anti-Greek, but news such as this
should be given proper coverage.
Without the Greeks you would be
lacking in many of your articles
and reports throughout the school

ear.

Without the Greeks, Homecoming
would not have half the enthusiasm
and support it has had.

I think it is your duty as editor
of the official school newspaper to
report such news which is in the
interest of a substantial portion of
students at SUNYA.

famine: flours?" ‘

Since last semester. there has been much discus-~

concerning the. revolutionary, pro-
s hours on campus. The

liberalizing of hours has, met with great enthusiasm

' by the student body.

\

The administration has indicated that it supports
this change and that the various proposalsare care-
fully being cOnsidered by numerous committees and .
councils whose ratification is necessary before the
revision in hours can be implemented.

We are sick of hearing this story from the ad-
ministration. This excuse seems to be a delaying
tactic used by those Victorians who have the power

event the reformin 0 hours.
to The administration isgnaive if they think the student
body’s memory is so short that they will forget all
about the proposal for hours revision.

lip Phi Sig Receives Recognition
Formal Rush Begins Today for Men

by Joe Nicastri

A week ago last Wednesday, a
motion at the IFC meeting stated:
"Upsilon Phi Sigma would receive
full fraternity status with equal
representation under the Inter-Fra-
ternity Council Steering Committee
to the full extent of its invested
powers.” The motion was seconded
and duly passed. It was the general
opinion of the five fraternities that
since UFS would be involved in all
inter-fraternity and' Pan-Hellenic
activities this year, and since they
had already served the prescribed
year as a colony to the fraternity
system,‘ they should vote on all
issues.

Unotliciolly Recognized

iFC' also felt that here is no rea-
son why UFS should not be recog-
nized as a fraternity, at least un-
officially. Technically, Council has
no more power to say that they are
not a fraternity as they might have
in saying that they are one, for as
long as IFC remains without a
constitution and unchartered, they
have no real powers other than those
invested in them by the fraternities.

Soon IFC will have a charter, as
Dick Clark and other fine workers
along with an advisory committee
from ISC are doing all possible to
provide us with this necessity. As
soon as we .have this, then, of
course, Upsilon Phi Sigma will re-
ceive full official fraternity status.

They have done more than their
share of work and all IFC can do
right now is thank them for their
fine efforts and patience while [EC
is in the process of re-establish-
ing itself.

Committee Chairman

Last Tuesday night there was a
meeting of all chairmen of Greek
Week. The Committee chair-menare
Open Houses, Lori Post and George
Leibowitz;'Publicity, George Schmit
Linda Klein, and Kathy Wilkers;
Communications, Brenda Dohnlek,
and Jeff Wesson; Refreshments,
Lynn Michaelson and Diane Kara-

denes; Guest Speakers, Janet Aro-
now and Jim Casteline; Quad Co-

ordinators, Susan Pincus, and Jim -

Malloy; Fund Raising, Lynn Greene,
and Mike Gerber; Evaluations, Flo
Riegelhaupt, and Dick Clark.

If you have any questions about
any particular aspect or any ideas
please contact the people most di-
rectly involved.

To the Rushee

Formal rush for the men starts
today. The character of formal rush
has now changed from interest of a
rushee in a group or groups to in-
terest of the group in the rushee.
Now, rushees will attend fraternity
functions by invitation only.

If an invitation is received from
more than one group, it would pro-
bably be advantageous to split time
accordingly. It is up to the individ-
ual to decide which one to attend
and how long to stay.

Because the rushee has not at-
tended a specific function to which
he has been invited, it does not
mean that he can no longer receive
or accept a bid from that fraternity.
By now each individual has a strong
idea of what rushing entails, and
he has formed opinions regarding
the six individual groups. The time
of formal rush (until October 30
when bids come out) will be spent
getting to know the groups where
there exists a mutual interest. And
then when the rushee decides to
accept a bid, he will be secure
and without any doubt in his de-
cision.

Sorority Rush

Sorority rush is presently in full
swing. lSC sincerely hopes that all
rushees will make the most of this
fine opportunity to meetthe greatest
possible number of sorority women.
Because a rushee accepts a bid
from one particular group, she does
not necessarily forsake all other
frieships which she may have cul-
tivated at this time.

Bids will be distributed shortly
and pledging begins the evening of
October 25.

‘R’orvela Super-Heroes" -'
Makes Debut OnTV

Something new in television ani-
mation has arrived. “Marvel Super-
iieroes,” a syndicated program
based on the exploits of five charac-
ters in Marvel Comics, is themed
with Broadway-style music, has
meaningful and dramatic dialogue
and uses unusual artwork--fhe same
kind of qualities that have made
Marvel Comics popular reading on
hundreds of college campuses.

Produced via a new technique by
the Hollywood firm of Grantray-
Lawrence Animation, lnc., "Marvel
Super-Heroes” is expected to at-
tract aduit viewers as well as the
youngsters who generally follow the
antics of comic book heroes.

Oldur Audience

Marvel’s built-in older audience
(documented by Esquire Magazine’s
current recommendation that if
you’re in college this fall, "you’re
smart enough to read :1 Marvel”)
is the reason for the special anima-
tion technique, according to Execu-
tive Producer Robert L. Lawrence.

“Marvel’s artwork is famous,”
Lawrence says. “Jack Kirby's work
on Captain America, for instance,
has been admired for over ZOyears.
If our artists were to re-draw his
panels for animation we’d lose one
of the great advantages of the ser-
ies -- the dynamic coil in of the
original art.

"Instead, we have takenthe comic
book’s basic principle of arrested
motion, and literally made it move.
The comic book creates the illusion
of action very successfully. Marvel,
after all, has over 60,000,000 read-
ers annually. Through a refinement
of the process knownasxerography,
we have brought Marrel’s panels to
life."

‘Morgan’ Successful
In American Viewing

by Douglas Rathgcb

No matter hov: dismal and disap—
pointing a lnuvie season turns out
to be, one can always count on the
British to send over some real
gems of' film-making to brighten
up the home scene.

This year, as almost always,
British film comedy has again
scored heavily. “Tile Wrong Box”
and “Alfie” are two sllining ex-
amples, as is Karel Reisz’ way-out
romp "Morgan!"

Mr. Reisz, having proven him-
self as a director with the spec-
tacularly successful "Saturday
Night and Sunday Morning,” has
now shown that he can handle off
beat comedy as well as serious
social drama.

Morgan Imaginative

Ills “Morgan!” comes across
as a topical, imaginative and sensi-
tive serIo—comic study of a young
Englishman cracking under the
straing of modern life wllile trying
to find his place in the world.

Morgan is indeed a lrlost unusual
fellow. Marxist-bent and bohemian
to the hilt, he conducts a campaign
to keep his young socialite wife
from rcmarrylllg, in the hope that
she will take him back.

But when his ex-wifc refuses to
return to their old recklessly un-
conventional relationship and vows
to marry a London businessman,
Morgan declares all-out war on the
bourgois suitor.

The fury and determination with
which he conducts his campaign il-
lustrates not Ills strength, but his
weakness. Ile desperately lleeds his
wife, for she Is the only one who,
until now, understood him and put
up with his outlandish behavior.
Without her he is but a helpless
child whose only real world is the
world of his fantasies.

He begins to fancy himself a
gorilla; he keeps ai‘uli-sizod stuffed
replica of one in the attic and imi-
tates the movements of the monkeys
in the zoo, just to keep lll practice.

Lost at ﬁclsheviks
Other times he imagines himself

“In most animation work," Law-
rence points out, -“the music and
sound effects are caricatures, to
match the art. But our art is too
realistic for that. We had to rule
out pops, whistles and pings. in
their place' we Ilave a carefully
executed score with the kind of
music you might Ilear in a Broad-
way show. And the sound effects
are on a par with the best science-
fiction films.”

Quality control has been a hall-
mark of the Grantray-Lawrence op-
eration throughout its 13-year'his-
tory. A longtime producer of tele-
vision commercials and industrial
films, the firm has also served as
sub-contractor for several leading
animation companies.
