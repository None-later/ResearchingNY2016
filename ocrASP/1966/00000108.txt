second round. and we expect to play the same ag—
gre'sive game that led us to four victories in the first
man .” ' v

Mike Goldych, Potter Club, 3-0: “In the toughest
League Ii’ve seen in three years. our problems cer-
tainly aren’t any less in meeting each team twice. We
were able to win our first three games even while
playing inconsistently, but I think we finally put our
game together last Monday against APA. We controlled .
the ball well and never needed to punt. It took three
great individual plays to beat us. If we can continue
to control the ball to compensate for our lack of size'
and depth, we’ll be tough.”

Bill Shriftman, Tower, 1-2: “The men of the Tower
started the season off slowly due to a number of in-
juries and because our offense failed to click. Then
in the fourth quarter of the KB game the offense
exploded for three touchdowns. We expect to improve
greatly on our 1—2 record in the second part of the
season.”

Wayne Smith, Sarfs, 1-2: “Reviewing the current
season, I find the caliber of football the same as in
bygone years, but the main difference ‘is in the offi-
ciating, or lack of it. One call by an official may
determine the outcome of the season. I won’t be
specific, but every team can give legitimate gripes
as to the officiating. As you said, the present system
of officiating isarchaic. I hate to harp on the subject,
but this has made the difference in our season thus
far. Not only does ,the officiating cause bad feelings,
but it also detracts from the interest and incentive
inthe game.” ,

Gene Rybaczewski, Kappa Beta, 0-4: “Our firsttwo
games against EEP and the Saris were close ones.
our offensive and defensive lines proving themselves
strong. But as of late we have been having trouble
in our defensive secondary, due to the fact that many
of our men cannot make the games.”

We feel that the first half of the year enjoyed a
great deal of success due largely to the fine spirit
of both the teams and spectators. If the second half
continues along the same line, and if the race tightens
as we expect, this could be the strongest AMIA pro—
gram in a good many'years.

That is, of course, if injuries don’t wipe out the
entire league. Things get tough out there. I know.

An overpowering team effort

 by LJlleilislow

by the Albany State barriers enabled them to defeat

. the New »Paltz’z‘varsi cross country squad, 17-46. Tuesday, at the new campus ~
course. Highlighting title victory were the simultaneous finishes of co-captains Joe

Keatin and Bob Mulve , each setting a course record. The tvqo juniors crossed the
tape, hfnd in hand, postl’ng times of 27’54.7”. which eclipsed the old mark by almost

a minute.

The Great Dane runners
managed to take seven of
the first nine places in
their best showing to date.
“It was a good contest
with ourselves for the
most part,” said Munsey.

Coach R. K. Munsey gave special
credit to Don Beavers in what the
barrier mentor called, “his best
performance to data.” Also lauded
was the fine record setting pace of
Keating and Mulvey. Keating held
the previous course record of
28'49.2"

“We seem to have found four solid
runns to back up Keating, Mulvey,
and Beavers,” continued the coach,
referring to the showings of Downs,
Rolling, Paul Breslin, and Walter
Ruelig. Also placing high in the
meet was junior transfer student
Joe McAndrews, who finished ninth.

The Albany State barriers leave
for New York City tonight to par-
ticipate in a quadrangular meet
with Adelphi, Rider College, and
St. Francis at Van Corilandt Park
tomorrow afternoon.

The long New York course is,
noted for its treacherous under-
footing and dirt paths. "If we can
get up for this one psychologically,
we will literally go to town," Coach
Munsey stressed.

APA Over EEP 19-18
In Battle Of Unbea‘tcns

by Glenn Suplr and Joe Cordomone

In the battle of the unbeatens,

' APA emerged on top in one of the

most exciting games ever played
on an AMIA football field. In other
play, Tower blanked KB 25-0.

A charged up EEP defense in

opening play gave early indication
' of how physically and mentally pre-
pared its team was. Denny Elkin
of APA showed the several fans who
jammed the sidelines that the Apa-
gogues were ready also when he
snatched an early Potter pass.

At the start of the second stanza,
EEP quarterback Jim Curley after
along scramble connected on along
pass to Ray McCloat. An interfer-
ence call and a sneak by Curiey
gave Potter the first score against
APA this season. The first of three
unsuccessful extra points attempts
by the EEPs followed. APA wasted
no time in evening the score as
Gary Torino took the pigskin all
the way on the ensuing kickoff. The
PAT was missed and the score was
knotted at the end of the half.

After Potter took a big six point
lead on a third quarter pass to
Den Wykoff, Ray Cianfrlnl hurled
long (45 yards) to Snake Zehurak
for the knoitcr and go ahead PAT.
Another long run to paydlrt by
Cianfrini proved ibo clincher as
Potter again scorcd with two min-
utes remaining. The game deciding
PAT was blocked by standout Elkin
to give APA the 19-18 victory.

KB and Tower clashed last Tues-
day in a game that remained some-
what stagnuni'untll the fourth quar-
ier. The fourth proved fatal for
KB, 25-0.

Jeff Zimar, the Tower quarter-
back, storied the action with n 13

yard pass lo Steve'Patchett at 8:07.
The point after was secured by
Dave Goldstein with the help of
Zimar’s pass. Moments later Bob
Eckeri recovered a KB fumble and
ran 10 yards for a TD. With KB
still reeking under this twist of
fate; Zimar tagged Phil Fortin with
a 27 hard pass at 2:10. -

The Tower's Sal Vllla,last year’s
League I leader in interceptions,
pulled a K13 pass out of the air and
set his team up for their final
touchdown. The final blow to KB
came with only 11 seconds left in
the game via a Zlmar to Patcbett
pass.

In League 11 play on Tuesday, the
Nads womped the GDl's, 33-0.

ALBANY, NEW YORK

Auditor’s Report
Discussed By ISA
At Annual Meeting

The Faculty-Student Association
of SUNYA held its annual meeting
October 18, according to a report
made at Thursday's meeting of the
Central Council.

Faculty-Student Association
(FSA) is the corporation which op-
erates Food Service, the dormi-
tories, the State University Book-
store, and several other student
services. it also provides houses
for new faculty and other faculty
services.

The preliminary auditor’s report 4

for thé 1905-00 fiscal year was
released. Some of the important
items are

Food Service showed a profit of
$275,803.73, the dorms showed a.
loss of $47,388.13, and the book-
store showed a in‘oiit of $30,250.21.
Miscellaneous income amounted to
$51,179.70.

After deductions for indirect ex-
penses, the net income of FSA
amounted to $53,146.00. As of June
30, FSAbad abalance of $234,462.13.

The FSA voted to purchase an
apartment house for newfaculty at
a cost of $117,000.00. These facil-
ities are suppoed to return as much
money annually as it costs to run
them.

Another motion was passed to
acquire an additional $5000.00 for
new art work for the new campus,
in spite of opposition from the two
student representatives, Vince
Abramo and Doug Upham, who main-
tained that the dormitories would
probably want to contribute dorm
funds for art in their dorms.

Also passed was an appropria-
tion for $3500.00 for uniforms for
the Albany State Band.

Control dcouncil Urges

Hours Proposal Action

by Ken Bernstein

The October 27 session

of Central Council ended

with two proposals that could mean action on the
long—delayed Women’s Hours Proposal, and a re-
appraisal of Memos from Minnie. Joe Mahay offered
the two resolutions. both encouraging student com-
mittees to hurry along their respective legislation
and to keep Central Council notified of progress.

The University’s in-
creasing numbers of grad
students feel that they de-
serve some form of repre—
sentation, and have started
organization on the dorm
level. Two members of
Central Council were as-
signed to coordinate efforts
for organization on a higher
level.

Who's Who

Election Commissioner Kilecn
Tracy announced that the list of
winners from the Who’s Who contest
have been forwarded to a national
screening committee in’l‘uscaloosa,
Alabama. The winners will be pub-
licly announced after the committee
verifies the selections.

The Living Area Affairs Commis-
sion has been given 105 paintings
to distribute among the dorms. The
Commission devised a system that
will give each dorm one painting
for each Quad Board Representative
it has.

Forms for chartered buses for
Thanksgiving will be available at
the next Solicitatons Committee
meeting.

Grad Government

Mr. Brown pointed out that the
University now has plans for grad
students to compose 40% of the
total school population. Initial con-
tacts with grad leaders indicate that
they wish a government separate
from that of the undergraduates.

A bill authorizing the formation
of a Student 'l‘rafflc (.ourl was
passed by the council. Tile court
would be empowered to review park-

ing violations only. The member-
ship of the court would consist of
two students each from the fresh-
man, sophomore and juniorclasses,
and one senior.

The highlight of the session came
in an announcement from the Aca-
demic Affairs Commission. The
University has received and ac-
cepted an invitation to appear on
the General Electric College Bowl.
A team of students from the Uni-
versin will appear on Jan. 20,
1967.

Wilson lo Exhibit
Paintings, Sculpture

An exhibit of painting and sculp-
ture by William Wilson, associate
professor of art at State University
of New York at Albany, will open
Tuesday evening, Nov. 1, in the
Humanities Building faculty lounge
at the University’s uptown campus.

Following the opening, set for ‘6
lo 10 o’clock, the exhibit may be
viewed through Nov. 22. Most of the
works to be shown were executed
in Mexico during the past year.

Mr. Wilson worked there during
a sabbatical leave and through a
summer grant from the Research
Foundation of the State University
of New York. The artist preceded
the current exhibits of his Mexican
work with a one-man show al. An-
tonia Souza gallery in Mexico City.
One exhibition will be his painting,
“in One Gulp,” which was a prize-
wlnner in the recent Berkshire Art
Association Exhibition at Piiisfleld,
Mass.

Research Methods

Dr. Levcy is primarily conccl'ncd

wiIb research lhni will create new

ideas, not in copyingprcvrous ideas.

To achieve this goal he uses the
Ul'lglllill sources of ancient tablets
and literature.

Some of his original sources in-
clude the Sumerian Pharmacological
’l‘nhlci, the earliest pleccofmcdical
lusiory dnicd cn. 2100 li.C. lie has
also studied the Dislellniion Vessel
found ill 'l‘epc Gaivrn, duicd ca.
3500 LLC.

licnding over 30 languages and
dialects, he uses this nblliiy as a
"Iool" lll understanding the Sri-
cutlfic writings of Ancient and Mad-
iovnl civilizullons.

Social Forces

in learning the methodical and
structure of these Sciences his re—
search is orientated around all the
social forces that have influenced
the sciences of the Near East,

Much of his research lakes him
to the numerous Arabic libraries
where he finds the ancient writings
of the Arabs.

Each year he goes abroad to
these libraries and delivers a ser-
ies of lectures throughout the coun-
tries bs visits.
