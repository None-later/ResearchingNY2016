Playing in near gale force winds the Albany State
booters played to a 1-1 tie with Montclair on Saturday.
The wind was a big factor in this game. as domination
of play was determined by who had the ball at their
backs. Both teams massed their forces on the front
line when they'had the wind, and then dropped back
to play defense iii/hen the wind was against them.

EEP Tops Tower 19-12

However. even with the
wind both teams had diffi-
culty scoring, as no one
could judge its force and
numerous lead passes out—
ran their intended receiv-

BI‘S.

Montclair scored first when at
6 :42 of the second period their
center forward Avi Saar took an
Albany miss-kick in full stride and
fired a beautiful shot into the cor-
ner of the nets. Montciair continued
to dominate throughout the period as
the Great Dane fullbacks found itex-
ceedingly difficult to clear the ball
against the wind.

Grant Danes Gain Control

In the third quarter Albany had
the wind, and threatened frequently.
However, their thrusts were con-
sistently thwarted by the stout Mont-
clair defense and by their own mis-
judgment of the. wind.

As the fourth quarter started
Montclalr had the wind at their
back and it seemed the game in
the bag, but the Great Danes fought
through the wind for one good scor-
ing opportunity, which tiiey made
the best of.

Albany Ties Game

Maurice Tsodud took a fast break
pass into the right corner, dribbied
past a fullback, and made a beauti-
‘ful cross. And Yuiulo Sililo was
waiting to deflect the ball past the
onrushing goalie and into tiie riots.
The goal gives Sliilo 5 goals and

3 assists on the season, while Tso-
dodo has 9 goals and 3 assists.

Legglori and Jursok Shine

Sililo's goal was the axiom of the
scoring for the fourth quarter, and
the two five minute overtirnespussed
quickly with neither team able to
muster much of an attack.

Once again the Danes got fine
performances from goalie Jerry
Leggieri and center hull ’l‘un Jur-
sak. Leggleri made 10 saves one of

To Highlight

by Glen Sapir and Joe Cardamone

Both Potter and the Saris pro-
duced hard earned victories in AMIA
League 1 action. Potter behind a
nineteen point first half perfor-‘
mance defeated the Tower, 19-12
in a surprisingly close game. In
other action, the third place Saris
utilized a strong defensive effort to
ask out an 8-0 squeaker over the
last place KB ballciub.

Potter Club, now 4-1 on the year,
utilized foot, arm, and toe in their
wlii over the independent Tower
team. Curley onthe second play from
scrimmage gilded through the three
man defensive line and broke out-
side, outrunnlng all pursuing defen-
ders for a 60-yard touchdown run.

Touchdown catches by Danny
Crippen and Al Babcock as well as
Babcock's successful PAT boot gave
the EEP’s all the points it needed
despite a strong second halfperfor-

again seemed to doimnnie tin- can. v

for of field and control tho play
despite the adverse conditions.

Wind Hamparad Play

The wind was uuioriunaiehccuusc
it greatly detracted from what could
have been an exoellcnt giunohetween
two apparently evenly matched
teams. A good indication of the
strength of the wind is the fact that
four goalie punts went over the op-
posite and line untouched.

The State hooters will travel to
C. W. Post this Saturday for their
final encounter of the year. The
Great Danes Will be out to register
their fifth win against four losses
and a tie, while C. W. Post will he

The KB, Sarf game, last Satur-
day, was an uninspired game until
the fourth quarter when the Saris
were spirited to a 8-0 win.

Howie Wecksler, the KB quar-
terback, led his team into scoring
position throughout the game, but
due to bat: luck and a few mistakes,
they were denied the touchdowns.

The Saris, on the other hand,
were eventually able to break the
deadlock and hand KB another defeat.
Their first score came in the form
of a safety, as the KB team was
bowled over and their quarterback,
Andy Mathias, was tagged in the end
zone by John iialuska at 1:00.

With 55 seconds left in the game
Wayne Smith, the Sari quarterback,
directed a 30 yd. pass into John
Haluska for six more points.

University Counc'l Approves Al
The policy regarding alcohol on cam—
pus has been modified by the University
Council. This new policy will permit
possession and consumption of alco-
holic beverages on University-regulated
property in accordance with regulations
approved by President Evan R. Collins.
This information was released at the
weekly press conference with President
Collins Monday. The President explained
that although the University Council has
approved the modification. the details of
the policy and specific regulations must
be developed by‘ responsible students and

AFI-ee

Lniversity

the Student Affairs Staff.

Some of the problems which will be
considered in forming the policy will be:
the serving of beer as well as non-
alcoholic beverages in the Campus Cen-
ter, the serving of alcoholic beverages
with meals in the formal dining room
of the Campus Center. and the serving
of alcoholic beverages at University
functions on campus.

President Collins stressed the fact
that this is an example of aproposal that
has gone through the proper channels
for revision of general policy and is a

 

“good illustration of the way such prob-

lems can be worked out.” ~I

Students are the ones to be most
affected and the Student Affairs Staff
will have the responsibility of enforcing
the policy.‘ These detailsmust provide
for the upholding of all civil laws such
as the proof-of-age provisions.

After the policy has been devised by

the committee of students and staff, the
plan must then be approved by Central
Council, Student Affairs Council and then
submitted to President Collins.
