Cultural Exchange to Offer
Archeological Work in England

The Association'for Cultural liv-
change, a British non-profit organ-
ization, is seeking volunteers for
a program of archeologicai re-
search in England in the summer
of 1967. Fifty college students will
be selected to aid in the “digs.”

Volunteers first join in a three-
week seminar for trainlngin British
archeology and excavation techni-
ques at Westminster College, Ox-
ford. They will then split up into
small groups for three or more
weeks of “digging” on an archeo-
logical site.

Accommodations at the site may
be rough and, in a few cases, un—
der canvas. "Diggers" should he
prepared to forego some of their
usual luxuries and comforts. Ex-
cavation requires concentration and

most of the work can he done as
well by women as by men.

American students willoften work
beside British and other European
students and the opportunity for
the development of many interna-
tional friendships is great.

Total cost of the program is
$685, includinground-tripairtrans-
portation frotn New York. Part
scholarships are available to suit-
able students with a 'B’ average.
Participants must also join the As-
sociation for Cultural Exchange.

Further details may be obtained
from the United States Representa-
tive: Association for Cultural Ex-
change, 539 West 112th Street, New
York, New York 10025. Closing
date for applications is expected to
he the beginning of January 1967.

(Both Galantay’s ar-
ticle, reprinted from the

‘Nation’ and ‘New Yorker"

magazines, and Cowley’s
response were printed in
a recent edition of the
Knickerbocker News.)

Self-Conscious Campus

A major point in Galantay's ar-
ticle was the self-conscious image
the campus projects. “it is hostile
to imagination and invites confor-
mity of thought and behavior." lie
contrasts Albany to the “proto-
typical English collegiate towns,"
where self-governing colleges vary
and have individual identity. Galah-
tay holds these institutions up as
ideal.

To refute this criticism Cowley
states that Edward Stone simply was
not given the rootn to construct an
English collegiate town. But going
further than just giving a factual
reason for Stone’s plan, Cowley
says, “Constructing a University is
a big operation, we’re not a small
family. We have n comniitlnent in
terms of numbers.”

Comtnentlng on Galantay’s ideal
colleges which have individual iden—
tity, Cowley says that "other uni-
versities had no choice-they grew
in an unplanned way.” Ontheir style
he simply says, “It’s to their ad-
vantage they are covered with ivy."

To criticize Albany because it is
not in the traditional style is ration-
alization. According to Cowley, “It's
wrong to be nostalgic about the old.
Don’t 'stop with the prototypical.”

by Aileen Kroetz

In response to Galantay's criti-
cism of the symmetry of the archi-
tecture, Mr. Cowley says in his
article that he finds it “imaginative
and exciting.” Quoting a fellow fac-
ulty member he says that'the sym-
metry encourages individual thought
because it does not serve as a dis-
traction.

An important feature in Stone’s
work which Cowley finds “unfor-
tunately drained from most of the
work of this century” is the sun
and shadow patterns. "The neutral
white background lets the sun man-
euver on the surface creating a
vast sculptural‘sense."

No one, Cowley feels, should be
intimidated ,by the symmetry or
rigidity of the architecture. “It
is refreshing to be involved in
architecture which does not fall in
line with the current fetish for ir-
regular and unpainted plllboxes.”

Parking Problems

Another point Gaiantay criticizes
is the distance of the parking lot
from the podium. In Cowley's opin-
ion, "cars are entirely too empha—
sized.” The only solution he could
come up with for the parking prob-
lem was a chaufferingsel'vlce;how-
ever, he had to dismiss it as im-
practical. lle finds the disadvantage
of no cars far more important than
the “inconvenience” of walking.

Cowley terms as supercllious and
locations Galantay's remarks about
the "potent looking tower” and the
“intraverted low-rise unit.” The
Columbia professor suggests that
the purin of the quadrangle system

to live in three-story units.
\

Dislike Popular

“it is popular to dislike Stone,”
Cowley concludes. “He tries to
make things beautiful, whereas the
new architecture is brutal.” As an
example, the columns are practical
and functional, butare also beauti-
ful, being “gently shaped and finely
out.”

“Stone,” he adds, “is not revolti-
tionary. lie is asuave, sophisticated
architect with some hold ideas and
a deep commitment." Any architect
endowed with these two gifts will
create buildings with strong identity.

Top Bidders Buy Witches,
Demand Tasks As Servitude

On Sunday, October 30, Phi Beta
Lambda had their "witch sale.” It
turned out well for all concerned,
with all “witches” being sold and
all top bidders getting their hour
and a half of servitude.

Three girls, Estelle Ingeles,Jane
Hoffman, and Terry Hoffman, were
sold to a group of six boys. They
were required to carryalarge plas-
tic ivory soap bottle about 5 feet in
height around campus and collect
money to buy their freedom.

This freedom was the price of
the total auction price for them of
$11.60. The girls completed the task
by going around to all the dorms.
Later that night each girl received
a pizza pie.

Washed Cars

Three other girls, Sue Goldsteln,
Sharon Toback, and Mary Etch,
were sold to 2 boys with an ancient
car, which needed washing. In 40
degree weather they ended up wash-
ing a car, which attracted many cur-
ious looks.

Veronica Knapick, president of
Phi Beta Lambda, was sold to Mike
Ginsburg, past president ofthe club.
She spent the afternoon typing a
paper.

Peggy Cogswell was made to do
some very interesting jobs. She had
to sharpen a jackknlfe, take ajacket
and ('lelUl it. She first used a brush
and then Scotch tape. Then, she had
to stack three ashtrays on top of
each other.

Carry Pumpkin

Peggy also had to skip to the
Colonial Quad and would have had
to do push-ups, only she couldn’t.
Joan Bavoso was made to clean up
after the slave saleand carry around
a pumpkin for the afternoon while
wearing crepe paper streamers.
She was also used as a model Ior
pictures.

Jacki, Edna Gnnderman, Linda
Sherry, and Diane Nagel were also

on the organization anti operation
of our present criminal justice sys-
tem as a system, its general areas
