Production Adaptations

Paul Bruce Pettit, the Director of “Lysistrata,”
and Robert Donnelly, the Technical Director—Designer,
both believe that Lysistrata is one of the biggest
faculty-directed‘productions to be presented at Page

LY‘SISTRATA is the spokesman for the women in their sex-strike against the men. Here, the women,
even the old women who are not fully behind Lysistrata, ruIIy to support her.

Technical Problems Play Major Part
In ‘Lysistrata’ Production Staging

Few people are aware of the
amount of time and energy which
goes into a production such as
“Lysistrata.” One of the persons
who is very much aware of the
technical problems '15 Joyce Davis,
the grad assistant who works for
Mr. Doneiiy, the designer, and Mr.
Haniey, chief, technician.

Since Joyce is in charge of lights
and is the student tech coordinator,
she has been up to her neck in
difficulties. In an interview, Joyce
was asked to expound on these prob-
lems, with the result that some sur-
prising facts were learned.

First, it seems that Page Hall is
not the great theater that many stu-
dents thought, at least not in the
technical aspect. There is a def-
inite lack of room backstage, both
to the sides and upwards (Joyce
called it a lack of fly space; at any
rate, things are cramped.)

Second, Lysistrata poses many
problems unusual to most produc-
tions currently being done. For one
thing, the forty members of the cast
had to be costumed, wigs included.
Also, since Miss Davis had the re-
sponsibility of finding most of the
props, she can verify how hard it'is
to fliid many of the diverse items
called for in this play (such as eight
kazoos. slightly out of time.)

Another problem which all pro-
ductions are going to be faced with
for the next two years is the inex—
cesstbiiity of Page Hall. Since most
of the student body livers on the new
campus, the four-mile bus ride to
Page makes it necessary that most
of the technical work be done in
the evening.

Many students have noticed that
Lysistrata was supposed to have
been done last semester on the front
steps of Draper or Page. It was
not done at that time because of
a shortage of student help, time,
and funds. (The production of JB
had worn most of the dramatics
department to a fi'azzle.) Since the
instruments of the University thea-
ter are not waterproof, an outdoor
production was almost impossible,
anyway.

It seems unbelievable that a stu-
dent could possibly spend almost
one hundred hours per week on a
play, but for the past two weeks,
this is the amount of time which
Joyce and many others have been
spending on Lysistraira. Even this
does not include the extra time
spent shopping for props and run-
ning all over Albany for a thousand
other reasons. No surprise then
that so few drama majors graduate
with honors.

vinco them that they alone can and the war.

Chances are that the audience will
now be aware of the problems which
Joyce has pointed out. As she said,
the technical aspect of a play is a
lot like the car rental company with
the philosophy that “Quality is in
not being noticed.” Soifthe audience
doesn’t notice any difficulties with
Lysistrata, someone has been very
successful.

hall. There are about 31

people in the cast itself

and 25 to 30 people have been working on the scenery

backstage.

According to Donnelly,
since all of the available
space will be used includ-
ing the Balcony and part
of the seating area, the
audience should be drawn
into the action of the play.

Pettlt commented that since the
reference frame of the modern aud-
ience is different from that of the
audience for which it was written
and first presented some 2300 years
ago, so the Classical Greek settings
has been dropped in favor of ab-
stract scenery.

Purpose of Panel:

The purpose ofthe 20panels, some
of which are “pop art” and others
which are Grecian is to give the
audience a sampling of both modern
and Greek elements.

The costumes will be an “adaption
of the present environment” andthe
actors will wear different colored

“long underwear” under the cos-
tumes and in scenes where they are
supposed to be nude.

The reason for the switch from
the traditional tights is to add to
the humorous effect of the play.
Through the panels and the cos-

Barbara Untraclit Plays 'lysistrata’
Lysistrata, “she who disbands the armies.” in the
famous play by Aristophanes, now being presented by
the State University Theatre. is played by Barbara
Untracht, a member of the class of 1970.
Although a novice to university stage productions,
Barbara has had a sound background in the histrionic

arts, and is not at allunfamiliar with demanding roles.
She has performed before-the audiences in the plays,
“My Fair Lady,” “Trial by Jury,” and “You Can’t
Take-It With You,” taking the lead role in the latter
two; not to mention portraying Helen Keller in the
famous drama. “The Miracle Worker.”

Barbara believes that acting in these plays creates

a wonderful

opportunity to meet people. Because

of the frequent productions the University provides

tumes the director hopes that the
audience will be affected in the
same joyful, 'but meaningful man-
ner as the original Greek audiences
were.

Universal Concepts

Since this play was written during
the war between Athens and Sparta
and is based on universal concepts,
it is meaningful to modern society
in that we to seine extent face the
same problems as Aristopliane and
his contemporaries. In the play
Aristophane is pleading for sanity
and an end to war, because no one
really wins a war.

Play FeaturesHumor,
Appeals For Peace

“Lysistrata” was first produced
in 411 B.C. as the city of Athens
was on the verge of another revo-
lution. Its author, Aristophanes,
wrote the play to make a last appeal
for peace.

The plot of the play is simple.
Lysistrata, an Athenian woman,
leads the women of Greece on a sex—
strlke to force their husbands to
make peace and end war.

Despite the hesitation of some or
the women and the supposed frallity
of them all, the plan succeeds re-
markably well and has the desired
effect upon the men. In a scene that
leaves little to the imagination, the
people iiappily rejoice and the play
ends.

Althouin Athens still went to war,
the Greek people enjoyed the play’s
comedy. The humor of it should be
enjoyed even today.

‘  Computer Succeed:

in Matching Effort .1
For Saturday Dante

At the computer dance
held last Saturday night, a,
poll was taken to deter—
mine the success of the
dance. Couples, chosen at
random, were asked, “Do
you think you were well
matched?”

Mike Greco and Jane Siegal gave
a typical reply: “We feel we’ve got
a lot in common, so far."

Steve Zippin: “I don’t know. Yes,
it’s great.” Barbara Castiglione:
“Yes, he’s really a great guy.”

Steve Thomson: “You put me on
the spot." Helen Eisenberg: "it’s
kind of hard to decide.”

Don Lago: “Better than i thought.
I’m having a great time.” Jane
Hoffman: “Even though most of our
answers were different, we’re hav-
ing a good time.”

Mark Drucker: “She wanted a
sophomore, and I’m a freshman. A
lot of things didn’t match. I wanted
blond hair,” he added looking at its
dark haired companion. “But i at
doesn’t really matter.” His name-
less date said: “It’s a dance--lt's
fun.”

\Varren Hull: “I wanted a blond
with blue eyes and I got a brunette
with brown eyes.” Chris Zawlsza:
“No, I wanted a social science
major and I gotachemistry major.”

Bob Jermy: "Yes, very much.”
Debbi Geiger: “Yes, the computer
knows what it is doing.”

Tom Giaqulnto: “I think we were
matched pretty good.” Adell Aik-
man: “He should be taller."

Gary Oberlander, the IBM pro-
grammer summed it all up with:
“Considering the amount of people
we had and the choice of questions,
the computer seemed to inatclithem
very well. The people don’t seem
to be matched by a computer. It
seems like an ordinary dance.”

Myddle Class Moves Up
Mod Band Scores With Hit

by Germaine Carosclli and
Nancy Szobo

“Don’t Let Me Sleep Too Long,”
a current lift on the rock and roll
scene, was recorded by The Myddle
Class which is definitely an upper
class band. This band composed of
five nineteen year olds, who look
like a combination of cowboys, cave-
men, and English mod-rockers bring
their raw magnetic power to the
stage of the Excelsior House in
Snyder’s Lake every weekend.

Typlfying this raw magnetic power
is their lead vocalist Dave Palmer.
With each neurotic movement of his
body and intense contortion of his
face, he lives the soul of the music.
The other individuals in the band,
Rick Philip on guitar, Myke Rosa
on drums, Charlie Larkey on bass
and Danny Mensolino on the organ,
complete the potent image that ex-
emplifies The Myddle Class.

Class has an original technique of
combining visual effects with sound
in their manipulation of lights to
parallel the sounds of their songs.
This two fold sensation produces
a type of psychedelic experience as
the iii-crowds of New York City at
the Rolling Stone, Cafe A Go Go,
and the Village Gate can testify to.

While they can produce apscho-
tic reaction, The Myddle Class can
also attain an extreme sensitivity
as in their performance of “Sum-
mertime.” Ending this number the
organ player, Danny, has five min-
ute 5010 which would silence the
wildest discotheque crowd.

Give Their Utmost

Each member of The Myddle Class
gives his utmost to an unusual ver-
sion of the rock and roll stand-by
“Satisfaction.” In this fifteen min-
ute arrangement the stage action of
the band is paramount.

They give so much of themselves
that one as an observer becomes

both emotionally and physically ex- .

liausted. After a night of reviewing
The Myddle Class the viewer is
completely turned on.

Under Scholarship

lard

I by Pete Goldberg

'A Turkish student. Ufuk Ozbudak, has just been
awarded a foreign student scholarship. The award,
of three 'hundred dollars for the current academic
_ year. was granted to her by the Business and Pro-
fessional Women’s Clubs of District #3.

Miss Ozbudak, ’a junior. will be at Albany for the
next two years. She is continuing her undergraduate

work, after having com-
pleted two years of study
at the Middle East Tech-
nical University in Turkey.
Her major is psychology
and she will be minoring
in sociology.

For the last two years she worked
as an interpreter-typist in the Min-
istry of Foreign Affairs in Turkey.
This past summer she came to lids
country with 102 representatives
from eight countries. Their main
purpose was to help form interna-
tional understanding. Upon seeing
S.U.N.Y.A., Miss Ozbudak decided
to stay and complete her education
here.

Concerning the new campus, Miss
Ozbudak said that it is a verypretty
site, but the construction mars its
beauty. She also finds the people
here friendly and her fellow stu-
dents always eager to help.

Miss Ozbudak says her me here
at S.U.N.Y.A. has been“very busy."
She finds that she mustdevoteagood
deal of her time here to studying,
but also she says that the content of
the work here is good. Although she
has studied English for some eight
years, Ufuk still finds language a
barrier.

in addition to winningthe sdholar-
slitp from the Business and Profes-
sional Women’s Clubs, the Univer-
any has waived Miss Ozbudak'stul-

on.

When asked what her reaction was
when Helena Grimm, chairman of the
Club’s foreign student committee,
informed her that she won, Miss
Ozbudak had a one word answer:
