Article Different

To the Editor:

I cannot take tile blamo "or the
completely irresponsible article
that appeared Oct. 28th eiltitled
“Katzenbach Discusses CivilRights
Progress." I simply did not write

t.

The article I wrote had as its
goal the portrayal of Attorney Gen-
eral Katzenbach as the brilliant and
interesting person we were privi-
leged to meet. I also hoped to ex-
plicate the vast complexity of the
Department of Justice. Whilelreal-
ize that my article was quite lengthy,
I also am led to believe that all
coherency does not have to be sacri-
fied when an article is cut. '

To begin with, we did not speak
primarily on Negro civil rights.
Nor did Attorney General call Lu-
reen Wallace's campaign “theequi-
valent of Bobby Kennedy running
his wife Ethel.“ Then too, anyone
with any association with Sen. Ken-
nedy other than faintly referstohlm
as Tile Senator and ilot "Bobby."

The modernization of prisons was
not discussed iil connection with the
South. We were discusslngproblems
ill the United States. The Attorney
General hoped to see modernization
within our present system.

The paragraph on the duties ofthe
Attorney General does not even give
insight in the fantastic job that he
must ext-cute. Nor does it give the
render any idea of the role of the
[lop-.n‘tiiient of Justice as a part of
fllt' U. S. Cabinet.

Finally, the little paragraph on
the background of Mr. Katzenbach
is fantastic. So “he went back to
Princeton and graduated." Quite a
profound statement. It was deleted
that he finished two years ofcollege
in six weeks -- after having read
over 200 books while a prisoner of
war. He graduated cum laude from
Princeton and then received his
LL.B. cum laude from Yale. Before
entering government service, Mr.

Katzenliach was for many years a
professor of law at botll Yale and
the Univ. of Chicago.

l let the “little” error one of
the ASP editor’s title referring to
James Meredith as a”Farmer” go
by. But the errors contained in the
Katzenbacll article were too mag-
nlflcent. A newspaper: owes more
to its readers than to just fill space
with words that have no meaning,
no significance. I believe thatallttle
revision of policy is necessary.

Aileen Schlef
(Editor's Note: Among the many prob-
lems an editor has in putting out two is-
sues ot a newspaper each week is the
problem of the person who ignores every
instruction. Such, unfortunately, was the
case with Miss Schlel. Not only was her
article too long but also, instead of
writing an interview article, she wrote
a syrupy history of a man. When a re
write was required especially since she
left without even typing her handwritten
text, the article concentrated on those
few points that were based on the inter-
view. The error oi the misquote about
Ethel Kennedy is entirely the fault of
MISS Schlei as it was taken verbatim
from the original.

Column Criticrzed
To the Editor:

The ASP, while usually at least
competent in reporting the Univer-
sity affairs, has demonstrated its
inability to comment liltelligently
on current affairs. 1 am referring
to Victor Cohen's article in the
October 21 issue.

I am not arguing with Mr. Co-
hen's statement that “sending blood
to the Vietcong is an act of aid and
comfort to the enemy; and it is
therefore treason.” One’s judgment
ill this matter would depend upon
who is meant by “the enemy" and
the application of the Constitution.

However, l strongly object to ills
til-founded premises.

 
   

    

 

COMM UNICA TI 0N8 -—

Mr. Cohen calls Ho Chi Minli and
the Vietcong "invaders from the
North" and “infiltraters.” The di-
vision of the country into "North"
and “South” Vietnam was a tem-
porary, artificial demarcation
drawn up to facilitate the French
withdrawal of troops.

“The invaders” are just as much
Vietnamese as the “South” Viet-
namese. Thus, there can be no
"encroachment of their (the South
Vietnameses) country; it is as much
brother against brother as our own
Civil war (were the Union forces
“invaders from the North?”)

“Tile sole purpose," Mr. Cohen
states, of the Vietcong “is to place
the South Vietnamese under Com-
munist control.” Their sole pur-
pose, as with their fight against the
French, is to place Vietnam under
Vietnamese control.

Ho Chi Minll is a Communist, as-
suredly. That is his social and po-
litical ideology. Does this mean he
is necessarily a puppet of either
Peking or Moscow? From a certalrl
point of view Ky is a puppet of the
U.S.; the trick works botll ways.

Finally-- and I'm overlooking his
unsupported generalization “how
bad Communism really is" Mr.
Cohen claims "in a Communist
country one cannot speak outagainst
the government.” It may very well
be true that in many or even all the
existing “Communist” countries
one cannot speak publicly or too
forcibly against the government. But
no serious student of political sci-
ence would claim that this lsabasic
tenet of Communism.

in point of fact, where are the
truly Communist countries? The
Russian people, true to the basic
Marxist Leniilnist ideology are still
waiting for Communism.

Asserting the right of freedom of
speech as Victor Cohen does, [hope
this letter or similar answers to
Mr. Cohen’s article will fiild space
in the pages of the ASP.

than just; the fact that we willbe able to drink on cam-
pus. At the press conference, the administration
placed a great deal of stress on the fact that this was
an example of the action which results when the'pro-
per channels are employed by students wishing a

change in' policy.

I
The President emphasized his point through a dis-

cussion of leadership. He

stated that it was easy to

display leadership outside the correct channels with
“have placard, will protest,” but he expressed more
appreciation for those leaders that rationally organ-
ize and employ the established student government
and administrative channels.

It seems that the administration is trying to tell
us something and is enforcing it by the actual liberal-

ization of a policy towards

which we have been moving

“for fifty years.” Perhaps students should therefore
take the hint and join the ranks of “those who employ

the proper channels.”

This is based on the premise that the “proper
channels” worked once effectively and they 'will again.
Let’s hope so. There are several other proposals

pending that would benefit

students if such favorable

results could again be attained.

We hope this emphasis

on the use of proper chan-

nels is more than an excuse to avoid change. We hope
it is an endorsement of the student government use of
commissions dealing with specific areas.

Elections Same Old Story,
Oller Voter No Real Choice

by Peter Pol lok

For most college students ill the
U. S. next Tuesday will probably be
an ordinary day. The majority are
not old enough to participate in that
great democratic process, which
we have been told since grade one,
is the reason everything turns out
all right in America.

So we can only view the election
returns with awe, wondering how
millions of people come to select
the best candidate for each office.
But when most people have voted
once or twice, the novelty begins
to wear off.

First, they question the necessity
of voting since one vote more or
less does ilot change the results of
an election. Then, many people won-
der if it does not make very mucll
difference which candidate is
chosen.

Trust System

Some may just trust the parties
and the electoral system to elect
honest, capable, moral citizens.
Others take a more cynical view of
the purposes or politics.

They may decide that the system
is actually hypocritcal, and men run
for office just to improve or main-
tain their own material wealth.

I suspect a major source of cyni-

cism is due to the state of the two’

major parties. For example, cam-
paign speeches and other party func-
tions are mostly for the loyal party
members aild are ilot an attempt to
enlist new support.

Many candidates seem to be oper-
ating on the principle of saytilg as
little controversial as possible.
Therefore, when Lester Maddox,
the segregationlst Democratic can-
didate for governor ofGeorgia,car-
rics the some party label as liobert
Kennedy, party affiliation becomes
a little absurd.

Arc Parties in Hindronco?

The question is do political pur-
tles actually hinder solving today's
problems? Are politics evilzunl had?
Perhaps we can see some hope in
the ways Ill which the party system
has worked through major problems
in tile past.

Traditionally iii the U. S. when a
significant minority becomes highly
dissatisfied with the prevailing atti-
tudes, a third party is formed.

The affect of the third party is
usually to force the two major par-
ties to take sides Oil the issues.
Either the third party succeeds in
capturing one of the original par-
ties, as the Republicans captured
the Whigs prior to the Civil War,

or the third party’s platform is ab-
sorbed iilto one of the major par-
ties, as the Democrats absorbed
the Populists in 1896.

Today there are efforts on either
side of the Democrat-Republican
consensus to bring up and deal with
“significant issues.”

The conservative movement sees
the balanced budget and local control
as the solution to domestic prob-
lems, racial discrimination and pov-
erty included; and they would meet
foreign crises with a tough military
establishment, which theoretically
would keep foreign dictators and
anarchists in llile, allowing the U.S.
.to benefit at home from its superior
society.

Problems of New Left

The New Left movement is strug-
gling with the dilemma whether to
support members of the inajur par-
ties to get results now or to build
up lndependeilt movements which
will carry over after the election.

The New Left’s major platforms
are stopping the war in Vietnam and
supporting Stokely Carinichael's
"Black Power" theory.

Although tllese slogans teild to
alienate liberal Democrats and lie-
publlcans, they present an appeal
to the electorate for working out
new, meanlilgful policies.

In any case, many of the New Left
leadership are partisans ofpolitical
involvement. They see their role as
that of educating the public about
the issues arid collecting voters for
future elections.

Four Absorption

Most of them fear absorption into
local liberal Democratic organiza-
tions, as evidenced by the majority
decision of California left-wing and
oivll rigllis groups in a“Conl‘erence
on Power and Politics” not to sup-
port Goverhor llrowu for rte-elec-
lion.

The polarization of voters on the
key economic, domestic, and foreign
issues has already had the effect of
upsetting the leadership of botll
Republican and Democratic Parties.

There has been a large increase
in conservative nud independent
peace candidates lil this fall's elec-
tion; and smile elections will be
swayed by votes won by these par-
ties.

llowevor, losing a few seals pro-
bably will not penetrate the com-
placency of the party regulars. It
will take an issue large enough to
reach the complacency of the voters
themselves. Whether an issue ex-
ists Ill the war in Vietnam only
time will tell.

With Deviations Fro-Tradition

by John G. Deonehon

The University Theatre opened its new season with a delightful production of the
ancient Greek comedy, “Lysistrata” by Aristophanes. One might expect. when all
educational institution chooses a 2300 year old Greek play, to see a result that
is supposed to be a comedy. Happily this is not the case with “Lysistrata.” The
director, Paul Bruce Petti, has taken many imaginative deviations from’the tra-'

ditional methods of pre-
senting Classical Greek
drama.

The interpretation lets
the basic theme remain
intact, but uses modern
devices to bring it across
to the audence.

Simply, the plot revolves around
the efforts of the women of ball)
Athens alld Sparta to end the war
between their two states. Led -by
Lysistrata they hand logetlior,sleze
the Acropolis, and go Oil 21 sex
strike. By denying this pleasure to
the men they force them to stop the

Spring Primer Poetry Applauded,
Writers Employ Effective Images

by Robert B. Cutty

As the short stories in the spring
“Primer,” the poems ranged from
peaks of quality to depths of im—
maturity. Several of the more pro-
fessional pieces have been reviewed,
as space permitted.

In “Write Me A Little,” Jerri
Ketchanl pleads gently but force-
fully i'or better communication be—
tween people: "write me a little
poem please/before l sneeze lily
soul/to the devil/bless you/sing me
a ii:tlc/...before i told my lent/
and creep away/...bless you”

Miss Ketcllm, always somewhat
evocative of William Carlos \Vil-
items and E. ii. Cummings, is di-
rect and appealing in her final,
definitive lilies: “read me a little/
word of love/ \\'orrlswiirthdoes quite

Dr. Jnrka M. liurtun, also of the
Drama faculty here at State, will

duced. The other plays to be. pre-

work by a drama professor at liens-
selaer Polytechnic Institute.

Quality at Naturalism
Two naturalistic poems of simi-
lar quality are Kathleen A. Earle’s
“Tile lilm” and Steve Curtl’s “The

'Roiltl.“ Miss liarle’s poem simply

and quietly describes the ‘slaugh-
ter’ of a tree.

ller opening lilies, “There’s a
hole in the sk)./ You...lielil the

a free flowing weekend which can
only be attributed to the excellent
collaboration of the director and
scenic designer and his crews.

fighting.

Tile flavor of -the- classic ele-
ments has been maintained, but the
wllole idea of the play is giveilcomic
immediacy by the addition ofpopart-
like pallets and a form of acting which
often bordered on force and bur-
lesquc.

At the beginning of the play the
stage is bare except for a few plat-
forms. To a lighthearted Greek folk
dance scenic elements such as
“\VOW," “Visit Greece," 3 pair of
reclining nudes- female oil top, and
“Home Sweet Home" written ill
Greek were lowered. Thus the back-
ground of the action becameucolor—
fui mass of separate scenic units,
each with .lbiting comic message yet
maintaining the true Greek spirit and
love for lilo.

By the symbolic setting of the
gates of the Acropolis the audience
is allowed to see the events which
take place inside. Tile effects of
the strike are as difficult for the
women to bear as it is for the men,
yet they have to be stronger. It is
only the strength of Lysistrata that
keeps the women from giving ill first.

Superb in Port

Barbara Untracllt, playing Lysis-
train as her first role 111 this thea-
tre, is superb in this part. She is
sure lil ller liiles and movements.

Music- In Review

She is the image of a strength that
almost belied the fact she is a
woman. Her voice has a quality and
a body that fits the character.

Tile serious consistency of Lysis-
trata is more than balanced by the
conlic antics of tile rest of the cast.
The struggle between the sexes is
symbolized by tile ineetlng of the
choruses of old men, led by Ed
Lange, and old women, led by Flo-
Fence Knein. Tile comic struggle
begins with a shouting match, but
soon turns iilto outriglll combat
after they strip for action.

High Point

lit a play where there are few
individual performances, tile high
point of the show is the scene be-
tween Joyce Levy aild Charles Bart-
lett. He tries, as her husband, to
lure her from tlle Acropolis, and
slle tries to make him promise
to stop tile war. He does not, she
will not, and she retreats back
into cllaste safety while he bemoons
his tragic fate.

While some' great moments are
seen froin others such as Janice
Newmark, Bonnie Cook, John Fotla,
Robert Clayton and Jay Kuperman,
tile interplay between the many
members of the cast is what really
makes this a play worth waiting to
see.
