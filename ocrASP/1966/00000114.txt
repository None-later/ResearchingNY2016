one of the more apparent problems confronting our
V athletic department is the inconsistencies that plague
every season. Our school seems unable to go through
, an entire season without‘ at least one problem, that
more often than not could have been avoided, throwing

a damper on previous successes. A case in point is .

the AMIA program and Dane cross-country team.
g Every year in the fall an event takes place that

- l seems to annoy everyone. We go back on standard

time, which makes’lt get dark earlier among other
things. Evidently. the commissioners of AMIA choose
to approach this annoyance with ostrich-like bravado
--they ignore it. Hence, every year for at least the
past three (and many more before that, I’m sure)
many. AMIA football games are played in near total
darkness.

The injury potential should be enough to open some
eyes, but we certainly hope that they don’t wait for
someone to get hurt before acting upon this. Another
, reason for action is the great inconvenience caused
i contending teams in trying to agree upon a mutually
' acceptable date for important games.

‘. All this could have been avoided had someone had
" the foresight to schedule all games to be played after
the clock change to Friday afternoons or weekends.

Or perhaps Albany could stay on Daylight Savings.

Another inconsistency is the cross-country team.
The season that the Dane barriers are enjoying far
outdoes even our most optimistic predictions—-a most
welcome phenomenon.

The team has lost only a single meet, and that one
to a scholarship school, Holy Cross. The team has
beaten such schools as LeMoyne, Oneonta, and New
Paltz and a good many others by overwhelming mar-
gins. I

What’s it all point to? A trip to Wheaton, Illinois,
we hope, for the NCAA small-college Invitational Run
held there annually. This is what coach Munsey calls
his finest team ever, and that is including some
powerful squads. It would be criminal to deprive this
team of an opportunity to display itself before the
nation’s best runners.

APA, EEP Clash Again

came on like a'storm in the second
half, scoring the first two times it
had five ball. The second score ofthe
game came on the same combination
of Curley to Crippen. Soon after-
wards, Ray McCloat, with one ofhls
four interceptions, set the stage for
a Curley two—yard plunge to paydirt
to conclude the scoring.

APA once more was victorious as
it thumped the Tower 12-61astMon-
day. The teams played the second
half under a blanket of darkness.
With visibility difficult, the teams
exchanged disputed scores in the
half.

Ray Cianfrinl, the APA quarter-
back started the scoring in .the sec-
ond half after a scoreless first half
when he hit Steve Zahurak for a
touchdown pass. in the fourth quar-
ter, Jeff Zimar, countered with an
aerial bomb to Phll Fortin to tie
the score at 6-6.

finished first in the var-
sity run, covering the five
mile course in the record
time of 26:43.9; followed
by Joe Keating (27:34), and

Following Mulvey (whose time was
27:37) for State were Grant Downs
(28:23) in fifth place, Don Beavers
(28:36.5) in sixth and Patti Breslln
(28:47.5) in eighth place.

"This has got to be the best team
we’ve ever had," commented Coach
R. Keith Munsey. “The team was
confident and they murdered them,”
he continued.

Reversed Result

The victory over LeMoyne took
on added significance as the same
squad had beaten State badly in the
LeMoyne Invitational at Syracuse
on October 1, when Albany had fin-
ished fourth and LeMoyne third.

"This was the first meet in which
we had an opportunity to run six of

healthy condition and our vastly
improved performance over Le-
Moyne shows how really well we can
do," added Munsey.

In the freshman meet, Jim Keat-

line simultaneously, each posting
times of 18:58.7 over the 3.4 mile
frosh course.

Following Keating and Roy to the

Possibility of Alcohol On Campus ,
Hos Students Asking Many. Questions

There was a considerable amount
of confusion and a large number of
questions among students asked for
their thoughts on the alcohol on
campus issue. Each student had his
own reservations about what should
be served, and where.

Junior William Pasko said that
he was “very much in favor" of
allowing beer in the dorms at all
times. However, he added that it
"shouldn’t be served at meals, but
students should be able to bring it
with them to meals." Pasko thought
only beer should be offered, “so
students will know when they are
getting high."

Doubts Expressed

Joan Salmon, a sophomore, ex-
pressed some doubts. She asked:
“Where is the alcohol going to
come from? Will it be supplied
by ourselves, or by the University?
I can’t see them (the University)
making cocktails before dinner.”

Vince Abramo, the Vice-Presi-
dent of Central Council offered his
opinions which might also appear
in ‘he Central Council discussion
of rue matter. Vince thought that
“beer is sufficient until there is
a restaurant set~up."

GermanJournalist To Lecture
0n Relations With Communism

Alfred Wolfmann will deliver a
lecture on "Coexistence with Com-
munism in Germany since 1945" on
Thursday, Nov. 9. The lecture, part
of the series of“Forum of Politics"
will take place in Lecture Room #2
at 7:30 p.m.

Wolfmann, a journalist by trade,
was born in. Berlin in 1923. He had
to leave high school in 1938 in the
face of Nazi persecution.

From 1943 to 1946, Wolfmann was
a civilian employee of the British
military forces in Jerusalem. In
1946, he returned to Berlin, and
accepted a position as the foreign
news editor an East Berlin Com-
munist radio station.

However in 1951, Wolfmann be-
came disillusioned with Communism

Bookstore Chooses
Caricature Winner

Lorraine Seidel, a junior, is the
winner of the Great Dane Caricature
Contest sponsored by the State Uni-
versity Bookstore. ller winning an-
try was not the only one which she
submitted. She entered three others.

The idea for the winning drawing
came to Miss Seidel late one night
after she had been up late studying
for an exam. She had been encour-
aged to enter the contest by her
friends who knew of her artistic
ability and her liking for sketching.

Although She Is not an art major,
she has taken art courses but has
never before entered a contest. Her
response to the news that she had
won was one loud yell of surprise.

She commented that she thought
this dog a worthy mascot because
they are very powerful.

The awards for the contest will
be presented at the Central Council
meeting Thursday night. The sec-
ond place winner is Walter Doherty.
The five third places winners are

and fled to the West.
The following year, he was ap-

pointed a special reporter by the
West German radio station in Col-
ogne. His assignment was to cover
the restitution negotiations between
Germany and Israel, in The Hague.

In 1961, Wolfmann was sent as a
special correspondent of the Ger-
man Trade Union to the Eichmann
trial in Jerusalem. His reports of
the trial were eventually published
as a book.

Wolfmann conducted a lecture tour
in the United States in 1964. This
tour included several radioandtele-
Vision appearances. Some of the
topics that Mr. Wolfmann lectured
on during this tour included: “The
German Soviet Zone - Constitution
and Reality,” “Soviet Influence in
the Near East," and “The Wall
and Partitioning of Berlin."

However, he opposed allowing
beer in the dorms, while he desired
that it be available at all times in
the student union. Vince also hinted
that allowing beer at functions on
the Mohawk property might be a
first step.

Many others wouldn’t be content
with just beer sold allowed only in
certain places. Tony Caputo, class
of ’69,»sald that "you can't just
go halfway with something. You're
going to have to allow all kinds of
alochol on the entire campus, in-
cluding dorms."

Grad Student Comments

A grad student said: "1 think if
the University is going to buy the
concept, they should go across the
board.” Gary Proulx, an R.A. in
Stuyvesant Tower took the liberal
view also.

“I’m an R.A. and Iknow the resi-
dents have liquor and it will make it
easier on them. In one way the
University is recognizing something
that is happening in fact, in every
dorm on campus. Proulx also favors
hard liquor and alcohol at meals.

Others looked at more practical
applications of alcohol on campus.
Chuck Brady commented: “Because
the University is so isolated, it
would be good for the students and
the liquor industry. Chuck was one
of the few who was in favor of
merely allowing alcohol on cam-
pus, not selling it.

Steve Williams asked: “What’s
the difference whether you get drunk
off campus, or on campus, and the
come on campus? Steve thought that
beer should be offered with dinner.

Senior Ed Hancock said that "a

student shouldn't have to drive five
or ten miles back from abeer party.
It would be safer in many ways to
have them on campus.”

A Look Beyond

Floyd liurst looked beyond the
alcohol on campus issue when he
commented: "This University won’t
grow up until we have liquor on
campus, Open Hours in the dorms,
and no hours for girls.”

Central Council member Sy

Zachar favored hard liquor in the
union, "at least on an experimental
basis.”
' Very few voices were raised in
protest against the possibility of
alcohol on campus. Sophomore Mel-~
ante Long was “extremely upset”
over the possibility, because she
was “afraid that it will cause more
students to start drinking and those
who do so now to drink more, and
eventually lead to the destruction of
more lives."

The question appears not to be
whether or not there should be
alcohol on campus, but rather, what‘
regulations should be placed upon
It, if any.

Student opinion seems to polarize
around beer versus beer and hard
liquor, and alcohol in dorms versus
assigned areas. .

In addition, many students were
undecided whether or not alcohol
should be sold, or just allowed
on campus, and if it should be
served at meals. There were even
some fears expressed that the beer
sold might be 3:2 beer.

These are among the questions
facing the student-faculty commit-
tee.

Policylin Selective Service Clarified,

Registrar Sends

by Ken Bernstein

A University policy of concern to
all male students was a topic ofdls-
cusslon at arecentpress conference
with President Collins. Harold
Lynne tasked President Collins just
what was' the University policy con-

 

submittod by Lorraine Soidol, who once owned one of those dogs
and thinks they are on appropriate mascot.

 

Overall Average

cernlng the forward of a student’s
average to his draft board.

The University, with a student’s
permission, may send a record of
that student’s average to his draft
board. However, a question arises
over which average is to be sent;
the all-over accumulative average,
last year’s accumulative average,
or' just last semester’s average?
Furthermore, does the student have
any choice which average is sent?

“No”

The answer to the last questionis
“no,” according to Colonel Brakow
of the State Operations Office of the
Selective Service.

Colonel Brakow said that there is
no state-wide policy governing which
average is to be forwarded, but each
school is allowed to send any aver-
age it chooses, preferably an accu-
mulative average to gel abetter pic-
ture of the student.

Beneficial to Student
When asked if a school could send
both a semester average and an ac-
cumulative average lf it mlghthe
beneficial to the student, Colonial
Brakovv replied that to ask for both
would put a burden on a school.

Colonel Brakow reasserted that a
school may use any averaged wish-
es, as long as it uses the same cri-
teria for all students. It is the
policy of our University to forward
a student’s all-over accumulative
average.
