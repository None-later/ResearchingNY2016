‘ V' Maurice opened the scoring at
b ‘utifu'l pass from inside Yutulo Sililo and bea
came back strongly and tied the game at 13.
‘ {The GreatDanes quickly

regained the initiative by
mounting a sustained as-
sault on the Post goal, and
at 14: 19 of the second per-
iod their efforts were fi-
nally rewarded.

Once again State’s diminutive
duo of Sililo and Tsododo clicked
for. a goal. Sililo fed Tsododo again
and Albany left the field at half
time with a 2-1 lead.

The third period opened on an
even keel, but a Post fullback was
called for pushing and at 14:25
Tsododo’s penalty kick upped the
score to 3-1. The Pioneers quick-
ly recovered, however, and a mere
50 secondsdater Doug Baylis scored

-on a perfectly placed free kick.

Tsododo Scores Fourth. Goal
' C. W. Post played an aggressive
fourth quarter in an attempt to get
the tying goal, but at 15:15 Maurice

took a lead pass from Gary Swart-
o‘ut, dribbled between two fullbacks,
and iced the game with a beautiful
shot into the upper right hand cor-
ner. r

Once again the play of Albany
half backs Tim Jursak and Tony
Glaser was a determining factor.
They, wish the help of Getto Hab-
Teh-Yimer, controlled the center
of the field and thus allowed the
Great Danes to dominate the game.

Danes Hod Successful Season

Thus the Great Danes came on
strong, after 3 opening losses, to
win 5 of their last '7 games and
record their first winning season
in four years. Offensiveiy the Great
Danes were led by Tsododo with 13
goals and 3 assists,,and by Sililo
with 5 goals and 5 assists.

Jursak, Glaser, and ilabteh-
Yimer stood out at the fullback
spots, while Dick Szymanski led the
full-back line, and Jerry Leggieri
made some outstanding contribu-
tions as goal keeper.

APA, 'I'ower Score
AMIA Victories

by Joseph Cardomone

APA held its undefeated
record last Thursday, as
it unmercifully downed KB
16-0. It was a lively game
from start to finish; with
both sides ceming on

strong.

Ray Cianfrini, the APA quarter-
back, started the string of scores
in the let quarter as he connected
with Gary Torrino for the touch-
down at 3:50. The PAT was a
Cianfrini, Duke Hotaling combina-
tion.

In the 2nd quarter Howie Weck-
star, the KB quarterback, was caught
in the end zone by Lenny Portuondol
for the safety at 5:00. Shortly after
this Cianfrini again threw a touch-
down'pass, this time to Rich Mar-
gison at :45. The PAT was picked
up by ‘l‘orrino.

in the third quarter KB put Tom
Palmer in for Howie Wecksley, but
they were too far behind to do any
good.

Saturday, Stuyvesant Tower,
scoring at will, romped over the
Sarfs by the score of 34-0. Tower
quarterback Bill Shriftman put on a
dazzling display of passing and run-
ring as he threw three touchdown
passes, two to Steve Patchett, and
the other to Phil Fortin.

The other Tower TF’s came on a
15 yard Shriftman run and a recov-
ery of a blocked punt by Patchett in
the end zone. Anpther Shriftman
score was called back with 2 sec-
onds remaining in the game when he
intercepted a Nick Pawienko pass
for 50 yard gallop. But the referees
ruled he was out oi bounds when he
caught the ball.

Coming off a perfect 15-50 victory over St. Peter’s
of New Jersey, Albany State’s varsity cross~country
team under the direction of Coach R. Keith Munsny,
will fly to Wheaten, Ill this Friday to compete in the

as Joe Keating. Bob Mul-
vey, and Grant Downs fin-
ished in a triple dead heat
for‘ first place with a time
of 26:22.0 over the 5.1 mile
course.

According to St. Peters’ coach
Bob Short, the time was the fastest
ever. He had expected acloser meet
but was stunned by the strength and
fitness of the Dane runners. Last
year St. Peter’s inflicted one of
four losses suffered by the Harriers
in the five year history of the sport
by the score of 27-31.

Forum To Present ‘China!’ Today,

Film Depicts Life Of People

Felix Greene’s docu-
mentary film. “China! “.
on life in Communist China
will be shown today at 1:25
p.m. in Lecture Room 3
under the auspices of For-
um of Politics. .

The documentary consists of ex-
cerpts from 12 hours of uncensored
colored film taken by Greene dur-
ing a trip to China for a British
television network which commis-
sioned him to make a film report
of the day-to-day life of the Chinese
people.

He traveled over 15,000 miles by
plane, train, jeep and even camel
for four months in order to produce
a film which represents what Greene
calls “the most complete documen-
tation of life in China today that is
available anywhere in the West."

Relatively Free
Greene says that he was able to
make up his 0wa itinerary and to
photograph what be pleased (with
the exception of military places).
lie says "the Chinese didn't ap-
pear anxious to hide anything from

me- one can wander around in the
city with a camera quite alone
wherever one wants to go. That’s
not the problem.

"The main difficulty is that the
Chinese tend to be rather shy about
having their photographs taken un-
less it's by a member of their own
family or a close friend."

Greene says that his film was
not censored at all by the Chinese
authorities. He took most of the
footage by himself with the oc-
casional aid of “very competent
young Chinese cameraman."

Influences on Film

“I know very well,” says Greene,
"how personal feelings can influence
any kind of reporting- whether it’s
in newspapers or on film. I realize
that other reporters might come
back from China with a different
set of impressions.

“So you will see China as I saw
it - and from the time that [first
went there, i discovered a country
quite different from the one I had
expected..."

Greene says that people will find
the film of quite exceptional inter-
est.

President Collins
Cited For leadershii

President Evan R. Collins was
recently cited by the local News-
paper Guild of Albany #34 at the
union's annual “Page One Ball."
The guild presented the award for
service during not only theprevious
year, as it had in the past, but for
a long duration of service.

Collins received a block of type
with his picture and the reason for
the citation inscribed. The citation
was as follows: “in recognition of
the twelve years service as presi-
dent during which he directed the
transition of State University of
New York at Albany from a small
college for teachers to a Univer-
sity Center, whose faculty and cur-
riculum match the sweep of its
magnificent architecture."

Along with Collins three other
men received citations for their
contributions to the people. Dr.
Ewen Cameron M.D. received a
reward for his work on the, so-
called, memory pills.

Also cited was the Hon. Charles
S. Desmond for his service to the
public as Chief Justice of the Court
of Appeals. The fourth person cited
was Leo E.Jandreau, business agent
of union local #301 of the Schenec-
tady General Electric.

The newspaper guild will now be
looking for other people who will
be qualified to receive this award.

has been said by Doc Rivette
of the local guild that it will be
“tough to top these men's records
next year."

Blazing 'liomlo Cane’
in light lip lift

The controversial documentary
“Mondo Cane" is this week’s show-
ing of the International Film Group.

This ltalian film has received
more critical comment than any
film of recent years. it has been
called everything from “a travesty"
(Film Quarterly) to "an extraordi-
narily candid, factual film" (New
York Times).

Using scenes of is deliberately
grotesque and shocking nature,
MONDO CANE juxtaposes the cruel
and the silly, the weird and the
typical to create a bizarre picture
of modern man's behavior.

its range is as wide as nature
and the world, and its message is
that people are basically bestiai.
it shocks and it repels, but it also
fascinates.

MONDO CANE is in color and is
replacing the scheduled LA DOLCE
VITA, which has been withdrawn
from circulation. \

MONDO CANE will be shown at
7:00 and 0:30 this Friday in Draper
340. Admission is 60? with student
tax and 76¢ without. BIlsea leave
the New Campus at 6:80 and 9:00.
