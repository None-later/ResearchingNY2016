For Pop Concert

Jay and The Americans will ap-
pear here Nov. 19 in Page Hall at
,7:30 and 9:30 pm. Tickets are now
on sale in HU 140. Prices will be
$1.50 plus Student Tax or $3.00.

Jay, Howie, Marty, Kenny, and
Sandy grew up in the same section
of Brooklyn. Through this friend-
ship and a mutual interest in ma-
sic, they came together as a sing-
ing group. This was late 1961.

Prompted by the immediate .suc-
cess of their first record, "She
Cried," the boys went out on the
road but it was only after many
unsuccessful personal appearances
that Jay and The Americans, with
the help of a manager, worked out
a plan for really developing their
talents.

With singing, dancing and acting
lessons every week, as well as daily
rehearsals, the group began to come
into Its own.

During the following 2 years,
while preserving their youthful ex-
uberance and their sound for the
60’s, Jay and The Americans broad-
ened their scope and began adding
show tunes, standards, and quite a
bit of comedy to their act. This led
to college concerts plus night club
and TV appearances.

By combining a beautiful big-
voiced vocal performance by Jay
some harmonies by The Americans
and a vibrant rock beat, Jay and
The Americans have come up with
some of the impact records of the
last few years: “Only in America,”
“Cara Mia," “Come a Little Bit
Closer," “Some Enchanted Eve-l
ning,” “Think of the Good Times,”
and "Let’s Lock the Door."
