(CPS)--Whlle controversies over
handing out contraceptives divide
many administrations and doctors
continue to speak on the subject--
welcome or not--some students have
taken their own initiative in the
area:

In Salem, Oregon, a Williamette
College senior bought a motel, of-
fered special student rates, and
renamed it the No-Tell Motel.

Student owner Robert Ladum
started out collecting coins for a
merit badge in the Boy Scouts. He
eventually opened a mail-order coin
company and bought the No-Tell
with the profits.

To the dismay of Williamette’s
trustees, Ladurn advertised in the
Williamette "Collegian," and dom-
inated his ad with a "No-Tell Motel
or Bust” headline. The ad revealed
that the No-Tell sports a “passion-
ate red” decor and is dominated by
the highest neon sign in town.

Offers Discount

An attached coupon offered a
twenty per cent discount for student
patrons.
.The administration had advised
the "Collegian" that the ad was in
poor taste. Oregon State Police have
also shown interest in the estab-
lishment.

At Knox College in Gaiesburg,_

Ill, students work through SENSU,
for an Era of New Sexual Under-
standing. It was formed three years
ago after students given a sample
test showed a serious lack of basic
biological knowledge.

SENSU has recently expanded its
programs and will write articles
for the college paper and sponsor
speakers to “stimulate interest and
discussion about sex and to deal
creatively with biological, ethical,
or social problems concerning sex,"
according to SENSU chairman John
Bodwell.

Questionnaires Distributed

Some students at Amherst Col-
lege wanted to deal with the matter
in a more straight-forward man-
ner. The student newspaper at the
all-male school distributed ques-
tionnaires at nearby women's col-
leges, Smith and Mt. Holyoke. The
survey focused on dispersion of
birth control devices and informa-
tion.

At both the women’s colleges the
questionnaires were confiscated by
the administration, ostensibly be-
cause they had not been cleared by
the school before distribution. The
Smith college newspaper editors
took up the idea and wrote their own
poll. They await administration ap-
proval.

Several Students Arrested

For Picketing

Several Albany State students
were arrested and released Tues-
day niglit for picketlng atthe polling
place for District 5 of Ward 6 on
Clinton Avenue to protest the alleged
practice of selling votes for $5 in
Albany.

The students involved were Wal-
ter Clark, Leonard Rhine, Gregory
Kiersz, Robert Fish, Beth Sabo-
wltz, Susan Policof, and Richard
Evans. These students participated
in order to support the Brothers,
an Albany civil rights group, who
organized the protest.

Carried Signs

Each protester carried a sign
reading "Don't sell your soul for
$5.” They were marching outside
the radius in which political ac-
tivity is prohibited.

The first student to be arrested
was Walter Clark who was picket-
lng with five of the Brothers. They
were taken away singing “We Shall
Overcome." This occurred at ap-
proximately 5 p.m.

Within an hour five State students
had replaced them. They also were
arrested. Richard Evans, 5 sop
arrested. Richard Evans, a soph-
omore, repOrted that he asked one
of the five arresting officers to
read the law which they were ac-
cused of violating.

The officer produced a million.
graphed copy of the law and read
it. The law prohibits intimidation,
coercion or obstruction of voting.

At Polls '

Evans told the officers that the
picketers didn’t feel they were vio-
lating this law.

Group Detained

This group was detained for three
hours in one of the police stations.
Evans described the cells lll which
they were detained as "filthy."

During this time, the arrested
plcketers occupied themselves by
singing freedom songs such as “We
Shall Overcome" and “We Are Not
Afraid," as well as other songs in-
cluding “The Battle Hymn of the
Republic“ and the "Star Spangled
Banner."

Finally they were taken from
their cells, hand-cuffed in pairs,
loaded into the paddy wagon and
driven to the court house. Everyone
arrested consulted individually with
a lawyer and agreed to sign a
paper, releasing the City and County
of Albany and the arresting officers
from any legal responsibility for
false arrest.

Charges Dropped

In his lecture Judge Segal said,
"i understand what your feelings
and desires are, striving for civil
rights and to help the underprivi-
leged, but you are going about it
the wrong way. When people do what
you did, you frightened others from
exercising ‘ their rights of tran-
chise.", ‘

At Mt. Holyoke, however, reac-
tion was more negative. A student
editorial blamed the Amherst men
for constructing a poor survey and
for falling to use proper channels
in its distribution. The editors said
that the survey should have noted
that Massachusetts law 'whlch al-
lows dissemination of birth control
information only to married couples.

The survey should have been fo-
cused, they said, on the morality of
the law rather than a policy deter-
mined by that.

The Amherst editor accused the
Mt. Holyoke girls of avoiding open
discussion of sex and morality.

Travelled to China Four Times

Greene, a British citizen, has
travelled to China four times and
has written two books on that coun-
try, "Awakened China" and "A
Curtain of ignorance.”

He first became interested in
China in 1957 when a business trip
took him to Hong Kong. Since he was
that close, he decided that he might
try to get inside the Chinese main-
land. Thus he did, traveling thous-
ands of miles visiting small towns.

Greene was formerly a senior of-
ficial of the British Broadcasting
Company and in recent years had
been the tread of the BBC bureau in
New York City.

In 1962, he was awarded an hon-
orary doctorate for his work in fur-
thering the understanding of Asia
in the United States.

Greene now resides in the United
States as is a broadcaster of news
commentaries on the West Coast.
To keep abreast of world events,
he travels constantly and makes at
least two trips to Europe each year.

The Campus Center
which is now under con—
struction will, when it is
opened. be “everybody’s
center,” reports Neil
Brown, director of the
Campus Center.

The building will be “partially
occupied in February, when students
return from the inter-semester
break," and hopes are that all the
Center's facilities will be available
by next fall. '

Flexibility

Up to this point, Mr. Brown said,
“certain decisions have been made,
but a great deal of ﬂexibility is
still left in developing additional
services, activities, decor, and
guidelines for the Center’s use.”
This is why student opinion can now
help make the Center the place they
want it to be. Mr. Brown’s office
welcomes all student opinion.

As the director, Mr. Brown
“bears direct responsibility for the
total operation and management of
the Center.” To assist him in co-
ordinating the functions when the
center opens and the planning at this
point, he has “invited the Commis-
sion of Community Programming to
be the advisory board for the oper-
ation and management of the build-
mg}:

Accept Enthusiastically

The commission under chairman
Sharon Teves accepted enthusiasti-
cally and are meeting with Mr.
Brown and his staff “to review
floor plans of the center and to
develop guidelines for the center.”

“Responsible student opinion will,
to a very great degree he used in
determining the ultimate uses of
the Campus Center,” said Brown,
“for as we open the center the
number of rules and regulations for
operating the center will be mini-
mal. '

One goal that is hoped to be
achieved is that the center will re-
main open for an average ofeightecn
or more hours a day.

The center will offer a large array

.of facilities which will provide both

dent-faculty population.

One aspect of the center which is

spire an atmosphere similar to a

ing, weather permitting.

it is viewed as a facility that will
"enhance the spirit of the com-
munity" and establish “a feeling
of commonality among the sub-parts
of the University, students, faculty
and staff."

Recreation
The center will house reading,
television, and game rooms.

There will be several study
lounges with the main one being of
a duplex design with the upper for-
mal lounge furnished with typical
living room furniture and boasting
a large fireplace withai'iyinghearth
overlooking an informal lounge de-
signed for studying and table games.

A large two story ballroom that
can be utilized for anything from a
formal concert to a movie had
draped windows from floor to ceiling
in three sides. Music will be heard
from a six thousand dollar organ
or a grand piano which will both be
part of the furnishings.

The assembly hall is alarge room
with a parkayed wooden floor that
utilizes a portable stage and can be
used for anything the students can
think of.

The center will provide 18 meet-

ing rooms of various sizes and of-
fices for student organizations such
as the student association, the ASP,
the Torch, Photo Service, and many
others.

A final aspect of the Center Is the
fountain in front of the center. it
will change various colors and
heights and be a majestic addition
to the center.

College Center Called

‘LIVing' Roam

When the new College Center
opens in the near future, it will,
according to Dr. Clifton Thorne,
vice-president for student affairs,
serve many purposes. He referred
to it as the “living room of the
campus.”

Dr. Thorne expressed hope that it
will become the focal point on cam-
pus for student communications and
“a meeting and mixing place for
students and faculty." Additionally,
he sees the center as a place for
the conducting of a variety of pro-
grams including lectures, dances
and art and music shows. .

Center Will Benefit All
Not only will the on-campus res-
idents benefit, but the commuters
and those living on the downtown
