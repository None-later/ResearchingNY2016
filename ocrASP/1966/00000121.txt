The present system of choosing stu-
dent representatives for the various
faculty-student committees and other
positions seems to be a poor one. When
students are needed, the president of
Student Association or a cabinet mem-
ber thinks up a likely candidate. Central
Council approves the choice without de-
bate.

What is needed is a system whereby
interested students are asked to volun-
teer for these positions. From a list of
students, Central Council could choose
the one it prefers or it could have the
election committee choose the one it
prefers.

it Board fin-operative

Shortly before the end of last semes-
...____.Jnss..CAn£no.L DAummps-aniwill which
made the Athletic Advisory Boarda sub-
committee of Central Council. This ac-
tion was taken to insure a greater dis-
semination of the actions taken by the
board and to allow the representative
body of student government to have a
voice in the financial matters of athletics.
In the past, A.A. Board functioned in-
dependently of Student Association. it
was so independent that the framers of
the new student government under which
we are now operating forgot to include
it in the new government structure.
However, it seems that an independent

A. A. Board would be an anomaly in the
present structure. Over a third of stu—
dent tax money is administered by this
board which advises the Vice President
for Student Affairs on how it is to be
spent.

The representatives of the student

 

Fred \sszks ' l

body on Central Council must be in-
formed as to how student money is
being spent. They must also have their
right to at least give A. A‘. Board their
opinion.

The new Director of Athletics, Dr.
Werner, and A. A. Board have appar-
ently agreed to these broad principles,
although the board ,wishes to meet with
representatives of Central Council to
revise the original bill.

The cooperative attitude of A. A.
Board and Dr. Werner are to be com-
mended. With the assistance of Central
Council, a workable agreement can be
constructed which will satisfy the de—
sires of Central Council, yet allow A.A.
Board to function effectively as they
have done in the past.

Researchers Needed

scientific research is an integral part
of any multiuniversity. On this campus,
there are professors doing research in
all areas of the natural sciences.

This afternoon Gemini 12 will bring
back to earth samples of micrometeor—
ites that were collected in boxes de-
signed at Dudley Observatory.

But research is not restricted to fac-
ulty members or people with doctorates.
Students have been doing a limited amount
of independent research on this campus
for many years. Harvey Patashnick’s
invetion is a good example of student
research.

Professor Hemenway has encouraged
many students to pursue experiments of
interest to them. The students’ work
completely on their own and receive full
credit for their achievements.

Presently there is a need for students
who wish to do theirown research.

Pun -Hell Report.

Coordination Encouraged
By Student Activities

by Joe Nicostrl

At a meeting held last Wednesday
evening of Pan Hellenic Council,
Mr. Neil Brown, director of student
activities, Miss Rose, Miss Burk-
hart and Mr. Silvey, all also from
the Student Activities Staff me with
the group to discuss the function
and form which Pan Hellenic should
assume on Campus.

—With all the council members in
attendance, Mr. Brown led the dis-
cussion which centered around
Greek participation in housing,
scholarship, academics, social ac-
tivities and University rules and
regulations. He spoke of Pan-Hell
as being an overall coordinating
commission, as a respresentative
group which would meet on occas-
ions ln which the Greeks must act
as a single body to deal with any

questions which might arise.

He stressed his interest and the-
interest of his staff in seeing that
the Greeks gain and maintain a.
voice in the University System. Mr.
Brown indicated his willingness to
work with the Pan-Hellenic Council
in establishing acentrally organized
body.

At this meeting also the two
chairmen of Greek Week were
elected. They are Debbie Walton and
Lynn Hewitt. All committee chair-
men are encouraged to remain in
close contact with them and to co-
operate in every possible way.

Steve Jensen from “Operation
Good Will" asked for a joint Greek
effort to help the soldiers in Viet
Nam by providing Christmas gifts
for them.

I COMMUNICA TIONS

Marchers Commended

To the Editor:

Careful readers of Friday's ASP
will know that seven State students
were among a group arrested on
Election Day for demonstrating
against Albany's infamous $5.00
vote. What they .will not know from
your story, however, is just how
scandalous the action of the auth-
orities was. To be specific:

1) Those protesting had checked
with lawyers as to the legality of
their action and were assured they
were within their rights. Further-
more, various people not otherwise
involved have testified they con-
ducted themselves with extraordi-
nary restraint throughout the day.

2) The men in the group were
handcuffed, locked in cells and
otherwise treated as dangerous
criminals. This may strike some as
a minor matter but as free citizens
and proud men, it appalls us. (It
should be noted the policemen in-
volved acted fairly and this is not
a criticism of them individually.)

3) Several in the group asked for
permission to phone lawyers but
were repeatedly refused. All did
see lawyers before appearing in
court to be sure but this was as
much as four hours after being
arrested.

4) To climax the fiasco, Judge
Harold Segai proceeded to berate
the group after he had dismissed
the case against them and secured
their agreement not to sue the City
for false arrest.

To those of us who heard him,
it was an incredible performance.
First he said they were not to be
prosecuted (obviously because they
had committed no crime). Never-
theless, he then declared them
guilty, without benefit of trial, so
violating their basic rights as Amer-
icans and demeaning their good
names. (For the record, several
community leaders, including Dr.
Vladimir Hartman, Executive Di-
rector of the Capital Area Council
of Churches, protested his action
to his face immediately afterwards.)

We regret the ASP did not carry
this as a front page story, since it
was among the week's most impor-
tant events, or deal with it cdlior-
ially, since these seven (together
with other students involved but not
arrested) acted in accordance with
the best traditions of the Univer-
slty.

It is not too late, however, and
perhaps the ASP, to say nothing of
the Student Association, the Faculty
and the Administration, will find
appropriate ways to defend their
reputations (and, indeed, the repu-

tations of all arrested who, thoug
not students, deserve the support
of students and University people)
against the innuendos of supposedly
"objective" newspaper reports. And
beyond this, it may be ways can be
found to commend them for their
actions in behalf ofhonest elections
and public morality.
‘ "Respectfully,
The Rev. Frank Snow and
The Rev. William Small,

open Lette'gampus Ministers

Judge Segai:

Last Tuesday, 23 people spenttlie
evening in jail for picketing against
bribery. You are the judge who re-
leased them, dismissed the charges
against them, and lectured to them.
I, on the other hand, am one of the
twenty-three people.

The‘ purpose of this letter is to
reply to your lecture. In the first
place, you implied throughout your
lecture that we were guilty of the
very charges you had just dis—
missed. This raised questions, at
least for me, about your feeling
for the responsibilities involved in
being a judge.

But, beyond that, I think you be-
trayed what could generously be
interpreted as ignorance regarding
the political realities 'which are pe-
culiar to Albany County and which
underlie the meaning of what we
did and why we did it.

When you spoke of intimidating
voters, for example, 1 was struck
by the feeling that you were speak-
ing to the wrong people. Wednesday
night's “Knickerbocker News" re-
ported that a car displaying a large
“Connors for Congress” sign re—
mained directly in front of the poll-
ing place while those of us who
pi’ckcted just 200 feet away against
the practice of selling votes were
arrested.

You said that we were going about
things in “the wrong way," that we
were frightening voters from the
polls. While it may be true that u
few iitnid souls are afraid of men
who walk in circles and curry signs,
I doubt that every much such people
would actually be deterred from
voting.

On the contrary, i would suppose
that the cxurnplc of men' who dare
‘0 Slim“ up in public against im-
morality would be an inspiration
to many people who had previously
lived in fear of what they thought
"the muchina" could do to them.

What we were working for, ac-
luaul’. was an and to intimidation
and the birth of free and com.
Petiiiva politics. No lecture could
GVGI' be stern enough to make us
ashamed of that,

University Offers Two Courses

Via Television For Spring

“Eye on the Universe" is an un-
dergraduate course in descriptive
astronomy. The course consists of
43 half-hour television lessons and
is taught by Dr. Harry Crull.

The course develops a general
description of the celestial uni-
verse-a thorough account of the
solar system, the nature of stars,
the Milky Way, the gaiazies, and
unanswered problems of modern
astronomy.

The student who carefully com—
pletes each lesson will develop an
understanding of the universe in
which he lives. He will appreciate

the relative sizes of celestial bod—
ies, their mathematically predict-
able motions, and the wealth of
known facts about their individual
natures.

"Eye on the Universe" offers
three credit hours to everyone who
successfully completes the course.
A lab is also available which, if
taken, will fulfill the lab require-
ment and raise the credit hours to
four.

Another television course for
credit that will be offered next se-
mester is “The History of Latin
America II.” 1t traces the political,

Professor Publishes Work

On Controversial Painter

Professor Mojmir Frinta of the
art department at the State Univer-
sity of New York at Albany is the
author of “The Genius of Robert
Campin,” published recently by

lirantsllow Available
For Foreign iirad Study

The East-West Center, an ex-
periment in international education
involving students from the United
States, Asia, and the Pacific is of-
fering 70 scholarships to Ameri-
cans for the 1967-68 academic year.

Initially awarded for one year,
these scholarships are for grad-
uate work in Asia-Pacific area stud-
ies and languages at the University
of Hawaii.

Some qualified students may have
their grants extended in order to
complete their degree programs and
are generally given an opportunity
for study and research in Asian or
Pacific countries as well as in
Hawaii.

Common Goals

A common goal of all Center ac-
tivity is the creation of a climate
conducive of international under-
standing and good will. Study, in-
formal discussions and intercul-
tural activities all combineto create
this atmosphere.

Students interested in working
toward an advanced degree while
taking part in this dialogue among
cultures should contact the dean of
their college for additional infor-
mation, or write to the Director of
Student Selection, East-West Cen-
ter, 1777 East—West Road, lionolu-
lu, Hawaii, 0082.

Aston Outlook

The University of Hawaii hasluug
had an academic outlook toward
Asia and the Pacific, a natural re-
sult of the multicultural heritage
of the 50th State.

The East-West Center was es-
tablished six years ago by the Uni-
ted States Congress in cooperation
with the University. In addition to
providing educational opportunities
for graduate degree candidates, the
Center sponsors non-degree aca-
demic and technical training pro-
grams.

Still another program brings lead-
ing scholars of many countries to
the Center as specialists-indest-
dance.

Mouton Co., The Hague.

Robert Campin, also known as the
Master of Flemalle, painted during
the first half of the 15th Century.
Campin has long been a subject of
controversy among art scholars be-
cause experts have attributed the
artist’s works to the Flemish mas-
ter, Roger van der Weyden.

Work Establishes

Dr. Frinta’s work further estab-
lishes Campin’s separate artistic
identity one distinct from, but con-
nected closely with, van der Wey-
den. in speaking of his work, the
author says, "I have tried to ex-
amine all of the paintings in ques-
tion in the light of facts and to
avoid subjective interpretations."

Professor Frinta’s study is based
on observations and research in
Europe and at the Metropolitan Mu-
seum in New York. lie utilized x-ray
and infra-red photographs as re-
search tools and they accompany
standard black and white prints of
the works under discussion.

The writing of “The Genius of
Robert Campin" is a culmination
of Dr. Frinta’s long-standing in-
terest in painting of the late middle
ages. He says that his interest is
due in part to the fact that, “there
is so little known about the artists
of this period....there are prac-
tically no signatures.”

ucatlan

The author received his under.
graduate education at the Univer-
sity of Prague. lie received both
his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from
the University of Michigan. Before
cotnlng to Albany, he served as
senior resiorcr and conservator at
the Metropolitan Museum.
