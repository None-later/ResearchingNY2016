Richard "Doc" Sauers began his
12th season as head basketball coach
at the State University of New York
at Albany as the 1966-67 edition of
the Great Dane cagers opened prac-
tice sessions last week.

Sauers hasn’t had a losing season
at Albany and this doesn’t figure
to be his first. Since taking the
rains in the 1956-157 campaign,
Sauers has compiled an outstand-
ing record of 1'12 wins and 87 de-
feats. His best club was the 1960-
61 contingent which finished 22-6,
while the low mark was acreditable
11-11 slate ill 1963-64.

Last year’s club surprised every-
one by postlng a 13-9 record with a
young, small squad. High scorer
Mike Greece is missing from that
group, but seven other lettermen
are back to provide a solid nucleus.

Four starters from last year

Practice

head the returnees. Mike Bloom,
a 6-0 senior froln Albany, was sec-
ond to Crocco in scoring last year
with a 15.6 average and is a key
man in the season's plans. ~

Two other seniors, 5-10 Jim Con-
stantino from Schenectady and 5-10
Lonnie Morrison from New York,
plus junior Larry Marcus, 6-lfrom
Kingston, are the other returning
starters.

Two sophomores, a transfer stu-
dent and three of last year's re-
serves round out the 10-man ros-
ter. The sophs are Rich Margison
and Jack Duffy, who averaged 17.5
and 10.0 points respectively on last
season’s Albany frosh club.

Robert “Scott” ,Price is the trans-
fer and is eligible this year after
sitting out a season following his
arrival from Butler University.

LEAPING LONNIE Morrison goes high into the air to score two
points in last year's 73-71 squeaker against Slena. Morrison, who
with six other returning lettermen, will form the nucleus of this

year's :iub.

Women’s Field Hockey
Finish Season 2—3

Albany State’s women made the
headlines this week in the local
sporting news as the field hockey
squad completed their season this
week with a well-earned 2-1 win
over visiting ilartwick College. The
Tuesday contest left the local gals
with a 2-3 record for the season.

Two Players Singled Out

Coach Lee Rhenish singled out
two players for praise after the
game. Deanna Bronson, a junior
from Chenango Falls, was cited
for her outstanding defensive work
in the game and throughout the
year. Freshman Cindy Lueckoff
from Huntington Station, Lond is-
land, was praised for her scoring
ability. Cindy pushed across both
goals in the win over llartwick.

Miss Rhenish stated that this
squad was much improved over the
1965 one which was unable to will
a sillgle game.

All Girls Return

“All our girls return next year,”
she said, “and we expect to be
much improved. We look for usevcn
game schedule which will make it
more attractive for all members.
"Actually," llddcd Miss llhcnish,
"what we need most is more com-
petitive game experience and the
larger schedule will do this.”

Albany’s other win was a 3-2
affair o'vcr Castletinc State of Ver-
mom.

On the third play from scrim-
mage, APA’s middle linebacker,
Lenny Portuondo, intercepted Pot-
ter quarterback Jim Curley’s mis-
directed pass. Ray McCIoat, safety-
man for Potter, soon countered as
he grabbed a pass thrown by APA
quarterback Ray Cianfrinl. Neither

P g 8, handing the Blue and White their first though as the my quarter ended

in an exchange of goose eggs.

Bill Moon, another APA defender,
started the second stanza by steal-
ing a pass thrown by Curley. For
the day, APA was to interceptdive
passes while the MIPS were to
grab four APA passes. APA was
unable to mount a drive following
Moon’s interception, and Moose
Wingate's punt gave Potter the pig-
skin. A pass up the middle to Mc-
Cloat and two ensuing long yardage
penalties gave Potter good field
position. A short run by Curley set
up another pass, an aerial bomb
to end McCloat for the only score
of the half.

The second half showedindicatlon

that}: would be a reproduction of
the first when EEP Alan Babcock
snatched a Cianfrinl pass on the
third play from scrimmage. Next,
it was APA’s turn to mount their
first drive of the game. A pass to
Rich Margison, another first down
pass to the same receiver and
passes to John Hotaling and Tony
Caputo brought the APAgogues near
pay dirt but a stiff Potter pass
defense halted the drive. Soon to
follow, however, was another in-
terception by Tom Doody, giving
APA the ball once more deep in
Potter territory. Again, the Potter
defense stiffened and gave their of-
fense the ball.

With the APA offense unable to
put the ball across the goal line,
the defense took over as Denny
Richardson and Steve Zahurak tag-
ged Curley in the end zone for the

safety, two points, and possession '

of the ball. The offense suddenly
came to life and scored on a pass
to Mike Gilmartin for a temporary
8-6 lead. However, in the final
stanza the EEPs were not to be
denied. A holding penalty gave Pot-
ter new life and Curely followed
with a touchdown pass to Don Crip-
pen for all the points the EEPs
needed to force a playoff this week-
end to decide the champ. An extra
point by Babcock and a scoring run
by Curley gave Potter frosting on
the cake'to win the game 19-8.

however, which brought his swift-
est acclaim.

Critics praised him for hisimag-
ination and talented use of common
American idiom lll his work and for
his use of simple everyday situa-
tions in the American scene as his
subject matter.

"Elegie Americaine," for ex-
ample, one of the poems on Miss
Wood's program, poignantly shows
us a girl in a soda fountain la-
menting the loss of her fiancee and
wishing she had taken the diamond
he offered her as a gift.

Strong View

Carefully molding such common
matter, John Weaver presents to
us a strong, feeling view of Amer-
ica and its people. In choosing ills
work as the material for her pro-
gram, Miss Wood says, "The woods
are full of Shakespeare readings,
but this Wood will stick to Weaver."

Accordir~ to Edward A. Morris,
a San Francisco attorney and chair-
man of the American Bar Associa-
tion Subcommittee on Weather Mod-
ification, Dr. Schaefer's discovery
could have far reaching legal and
political ramifications.

Said Mr. Morris, "11' our atmos-
phere is now found to be contam-
inated by lead to such an extent
that uncontrolled cloud seeding is
occurring almost everywhere, then
it would seem that Congress should
immediately increase its efforts to
half further air pollution from auto-
mobiles."

Legal Aspects

According to Mr. Morris, who
has been working with the legal
aspects of weather modification for
eight years, Dr. Schaefer's discov-
ery is of sufficient importance to
warrant an immediate sampling of
the atmosphere at all altitudes and

3...

throughout Canada and the United
States in order to give the legis-
lators ample factual material sothet
they may visualize the magnitude of
the problem and the possible in-
fluence it Is having on the climate.

Since the automobile engine is
probably the largest source of lead
particles in most urban smog, spot
or continuous monitoring could in-
dicate the contribution made to the
total mass of particles and whether
control methods are being effec-
tive. Also, there is now a possi-
bility that experiments could be
devised that would utilize the re-
action to assess the effect of the
hitherto undetectable particles on
respiratory ingestion.

Address

Dr. Schaefer, whose address was
entitled, "Challenging Problems in
the Atmospheric Sciences," said
that the recent findings could change
research activities and present
methods of weather odlfication.

The method of producing ice crystal
nuclei in concenter In high In
a million per liter in the free at-
mosphere where automobiles have
been operating depends on the for-
mation of less than a monomolecular
layer of iodine on the surface of
submtcroscopic lead oxideparticles
emitted in large numbers from auto
exhaust as a result of ,the nearly
universal use of tetraethyl lead in
gasoline as an anti-knock material.

In a typical experiment, a five-
second collection of the exhaust
from an idling automobile engine
(about 80 liters) produces more than
100 million ice crystals inalrnatnr-
ated with water at 15degrees Centi-
grade. The sample is caught in I
plastic bag placed over the utmost
pipe and is then expelled into a

‘ loo-liter cold chamber having air

temperature of -20 degrees Cen-
tigrade.
