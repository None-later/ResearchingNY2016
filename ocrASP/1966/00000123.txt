'Marlon/Brando and an under-
ground “documentary” share this
week’s program of the International
Film Group. ’

"The Wild One” has become a
classicvof sorts: one of the first
films on the motorcycle cult and a
vehicle for one of Brando's most
popular roles. As the leader of a
cycle gang terrorizing asmall town,
he projects a mixture of cynicism
and cool and angry rebellionrAlso
starring is Lee Marvin as the lead-
er of a rival gang.

It is impossible to describe
"Scorpio Rising" in a few words.
Subtitled "The Myth of the American
Motorcyclist," it utilizes.a rock
soundtrack by Presley, the Angels,
Ray Charles, and others. It tells
the story of a motorycycle gang

lead iodide, which then serves as
nucleation center for ice crystal
formation, is so sensitive that it is
difficult to visualize its effective-

SpeechA nd Drama Department
Initiate Television Course

Next semester the/Department of
Speech and Dramatic Art will offer
a course in the fundamentals of
radio and television. The content
of the course will be an analysis
and appreciation of techniques and
will be a pre-requisite for future
courses.

More courses will be added in the
following semesters until there are

‘ ” hours ofcourses, sufficient
for a minor field of study.

As of now, it appears that the
television studios will not be moved
out to the New Campus before the
spring 011908.

The television department has
some interesting tasks to perform
in the near future. It lnust produce
a one minute film about the Uni-
verslty to be shown on the General
Electric College Bowl, and revise
the freshman orientation film. In
addition, the department is con-
structing a similation of the condi-
tions members of the GE College
Bowl team will face, including glar-
ing lights.

Telethon

Perhaps the most complicated
task it faces is televising the All
University Mental Health Telethon,
sometime in the spring.

The instructor for the course in
fundamentals, Sh 6, will be John
Martin Gunn, who Joined the fac-
ulty this semester. Gunn has spent
his entire career in communications
work. After earning his D.A. at
Harvard in 1034, he beame a pro-
ducer for Decca records.

Afterwards, he became a free-
lance producer of radio and tele-
vision commercials in the early days
of television. From 1052 until 1002,
Gunn produced radio and television
programs for the National Council

For three years after that, he
was a senior producer for WNDT,.
an educational television station in
New York City. Last year, Gunn
attended Teachers College, Colum-
bia University, to earn his mas-
ters in teaching.

Gunn assumed that eventually the
University would offer a major in
the field, but as of now, only fresh-
men and sophomores will be able
to consider it as a minor due to

' Dr. :schaefer, who becamedirec-
tor of The Atmospheric Sciences
Research Center at Albany'earlier
this year, is known internationally
for his invention of a cloud seeding
technique which “triggered” rain
and snow from supercooled clouds.
His professional career in science
began in 1931 when he was selected
by Dr. Irving Langmuir to be lab-
oratory assistant at General Elec-
tric Research Laboratory.

Research Associate

Within a few years he became a
research associate working with
Dr. Langmuir on basic studies on
surface chemistry.

It was 20 years ago this month
that Dr. Schaefer’s paper, “The
Production of Ice Crystals in a
Cloud of Super Cooled Water Drop-
lets,” appeared in "Science," the
weekly journal published by the
American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science. Dr. Schaefer
stated that the most recent discov-
ery, made while working at the
National Sciences Institute ASRC
Field Station at Flagstaff, Arizona,
is an outgrowth of work carried on

Dramatics Council of the State
University of New York at Albany
will present the Galaxy Players'
production of "Royal Gambit," De—
cember 2 and 3, 1900, in Page Hall
at 8:30 p.m. A German play written
by llermnnn Gressieker, “Royal
Gambit” was first produced in Ger-
many in 1954, and since then it has
been staged in every major theatre
in that country and in Austria.

in 10548 the play, which centers
around King Henry the Eighth as a
'symbol of modern man, received
the Gerhart l'lauptmann Award. The
Galaxy Players of Schenectady is
an acting group which was formed
with the intention of furthering
repertory playing.

Under the direction of Sam Mor-
rell, the group has played exten-
sively throughout the area. “Royal
Gambit” is the first of two pro-
ductions the Galaxy Players will
present under the sponsorship of'
of Dramatics Council.

The second production, Chekhov's
“Uncle Vanya," will be given in
April. Tickets for “Royal Gambit"
are now on sale. Seats may be re- .

served by calling the State Univer-

Direct Application

Specifically, this work has direct
application to almost every field of
scientific investigation -- precipita-
tion mechanisms in cloud physics,
plant growth in biology, trace ele-
ment effects in chemistry, weather
forecasting in meteorology, testing
and standardization procedures in
engineering, human behavior. in the
social sciences and a variety of
implications in the legal profes-
sion.

“You might say that Dr. Schaefer
has ‘done it again.’ In 1946 he came
foth with a discovery that has kept
us all busy for the past 20 years.
Now he had demonstrated another
phenomenon so beautifully funda-
mental, yet so stimulating to even
the dullest imagination, that we will
all be busy another 20 years attempt-
ing to unravel the total implications
from his latest 'bombshell'.”

take book orders now. Allow six
weeks for delivery.

 

AL DAVEY spoke of o Logos Popularii meeting to answer ques-

tions concerning the bookstore.

Davey Defends Profits

Discusses Future Uses

by Sue Sammartano

Students have been wondering if
the Bookstore has been making a
sizable profit, and, if so, what is
being done with the money? Mr.
Davey, director of merchandising,
was asked this question by mem-
bers of Logos Popularii Tuesday
night.

in reply, he stated that the Book-
store is a profit-making organiza-
tion for several reasons. To begin
with, he said that in order to run
efficiently and to be able to expand
in the future the Bookstore must do
better than break even.

Mr. Davey went on to say that the
profits the Bookstore has been mak-
ing will be used to support various

the past because the Bookstore has
not been able to turn over its in-
ventory properly.

Mr. Davey did not try to justify
what the Bookstore has done in the
past. He said that the Bookstore is
and will continue improving, but that
it could not be done overnight.

The Bookstore is now gearing its
efforts towards offering a 10% dis-
count on textbooks during one week
of next semester. Paperbacks would
then be sold at apermanent discount.

However, this is not positive yet;
it is only being worked on.

Mr. Davey also mentioned that
efforts are being made to open a
secondhand bookstore by next fall.

With this line in a scientifically "

created language which no one can
understand, begins "The Memoran-
dum,” the State University Thea-
tre’s second production of the ‘sea-

son. -

The play is directed by Dr. Jerks
M. Burton and will be presented
December 6-l0, 13-17 in Richard-
son Studio Theatre, Room 291.

V In “TheMemorandum,”adeposed
“office director seeks to regain his
position but is unable to do so until
he has a message translated from
the newly-created office language,
ptydepe. A translation is impos-
sible, however, until he has his
message translated, and he cannot
have his message translated until
he has his message translated.

And so he moves through a funny
tangle of events.

Played in Czechoslovakia and Berlin
Played previously in Czechoslo-
vakia and West Berlin, “The Mem-
orandum” is the latest product of
co nte in pa r ar y Czechoslovakian
playwright, Vaclav Havel.

Havel has done one other full-
length play and is closely related
to avant-garde theatre in Prague.
This latest play, a satiric farce,
shows the result ofallowingamech-
anlstic regime to make people into
mere “creatures of function."

Jarka M. Burian, director of "The
Memorandum,” says the author re-
lates his theme by depicting an of-
fice which operates as a “compli-
cated machine with a slipped screw.
The machine operates but not as it
was intended.”

The nature of the play, since it
criticizes any bureaucratic regime,
indicates a certain degree of free-
dam in Czechoslovakia, conﬁrm.-
the director, but it also shows the

inginuity sut: r
«avoid unsprshlp. v

 

one scene a tactic of the scien-
tificallyacrested language expels'the
single remaining studentin’ths class
so the rest of the class will not be ‘
held back. ‘ ’ '

Still, the director feels the-play
would not be classified as Theatre
of the Absurd; instead, there are
absurd aspects in arealistic frame-
work. The disturbing aspects of the
play, on the other hand, create ser-'
ious undertones.

The artificial, scientific language
created in the play could just as
easily be the "officialeae” of pro.
sent day bureaucracy.

Burian first became familiar with
"The Memorandum," while teaching
in Czechoslovakia last year, when
he saw the play produced and met

the author. He describes Havel as \

being a "young, American football
type in appearance" who holds the
position of dramaturg for the Thea-
tre at the Balustrade, a repertory
theatre in Prague.
