FSA To Sign 8th Contract
To Receive Fonnai'Recognition

When the University’s Faculty Student Association signs a pending contract with
the New York State University System, the Faculty Student Association, or FSA,
will receive formal recognition as a legally recognized corporation which exists
within the State System while remaining financially independent of the State.

The contract, which will be signed within the next few weeks, will legally define
and reinforce the basic principles FSA adopted when it was begun sixteen years

ago. These principles are to exist as a

self-supporting organization which will

provide certain services necessary, and beneficial to the University. It is essen-
tially a “non—profit educational and benevolent corporation" (Article I, Section II,

FSA By-Laws).

It presently has the status of a membership cor-
poration and is composed of twenty members which
are representative of the University Community. The
Association is presently composed of six student
members, six faculty members, and eight adminis—
trative members. A majority is needed to provide a
quorum for any transactions of the Association.

The entire Association meets at
least once a year in an annual
meeting which receives the annual
reports of officers, directors, and
-commltiees, and for the transaction
of other business.

Each member of the Association
carries one vote, and a member may
vote by proxy executed in writing.

Special meetings of the Associa-
tion may be called by the President
or the Board of Directors at any
time, or may be called by any five
members of the Association wxih
written request sulnnitiod to the
President.

Nine of these members scl'Vc as
members of a Board of Directors
which meets at regular six week
intervals. The Board is composed
of ex-oiiicio members of the Uni-
versity Community and is headed
by the President of the University.

Board of Directors

The otlicr members of the Board
are Vice President for Student AI-
fairs, Vice President of Academic
Affairs, Chairman of the Faculty
Council, the Undergraduate Dean,
Dean of the School of Business, the
Business Manager of the Univer-
sity, the President of the Student
Association, and one female mem-
ber of the Student Affairs Office.

All FSA policies result from de-
liberations ofthe Association and/or
the Board of Directors. The Board

'essary employees,

of Directors shall have the power
to appoint committees, employ nec-
authorize ex-
penditures, and take such measures
a. may be necessary or proper to
carry out the purposes of the Asso—
ciation.

Extensive Investigation

The approval by the State of an
independent business organizations
such as FSA is the result of exten-
sive investigation by an outside
consulting firm hired by the State.

This investigation also covered
the similar organizations which pro-
scntly exist In other branches of the
SONY system.

The contract will containthcprin-
ciples under which FSA was orig-
inally set up, especially the idea
that all business transactions will
be entered into with connection to
service oi the University.

it also retains exclusive rights
to run a food service, a bookstore,
student laundry, insurance pro-
grams, and the right to purchase
real estate for further expansion,

Under the contract FSA retains
the legal right to act as custodian
for various university branches, ad-
ministering scholarship funds. Pro-
vide a student loan fund. set up
faculty housing and other short
terming housing programs, and or-
range for dormitory damage de-
posits. .

invalid-um

The signature of the Association
of the Faculty Student Association,
or FSA, on a contract with the New
York state University System will
give formal recognition to FSA. it
may thus exist as a business or-
ganization which is allowed to exist
in the State University System and
still remain financially independent
of that system.

This decision to bestow this for-
mal recognition will be preceded
by, an extensive investigation by an
outside investigating firm employed
by the State University System.

‘ The contract will reinforce the
FSA policy that it exists primarily
to render service, or to “do good”
for the University, and is legally
allowed to make a profit which will
provide them with funds instru-
mental in this type of expansion.

To insure adherence to this poi—
lcy, and to provide a legal state-
ment regarding the expenditure of
FSA funds, a large auditor’s report
is compiled annually by Peat, Mar-
wick, Mitchell and Co.

This report exists in document
form and copies are made available
to all Board members, and in an
abbreviated form to all members
oi the Association.

The two main money making op-
erations encompassed by FSA are
the Bookstore and Food Service.
According to the June 30, 1966 re-
port compiled by Peat, Marwick
and Mitchell Co., Food Service
' showed a gross income before other
indirect expenses of $275,000 (to
nearest whole dollar).

The Bookstore showed aNet Sales
of $560,000, with a Net Income of
$30,250. Whereas the Net Loss be-
fore other indirect expenses for
dormitories was $47,388.

Therefore the Net Income of tho
FSA before other indirect expenses
was $258,665.

Indirect expenses amounted to
$181,698 (payrolls,dcpreciation, oi-
fiCe supplies), plus a $75,000 pay-
ment for the pension plan set up in
1965.

Other incomes (vending commis-
sions, sale of old properties etc.)
amounted to $53, 145; therefore leav-
ing FSA with a General Fund Net
Income of $53,146, on which to un-
dertake new services for the Uni-
versity.

FSA Grew With University

Prime Goals

The Faculty Student As-
sociation, inc. was formed
in 1950 by five members of
the administration and the
faculty, including Presi—
dent Evan R. Collins, Dean
of the School of Business
Milton C. Olson, and Ben—
jamin J. Comi, Director of
Business Affairs.

FSA was formed tomake
available to the president
of the then Stale Teachers
College a device to run a
food service and a book-
store. At that time, the
cafeteria in Hosted and a
co-op store were already
in existence.

These ventures had
proved unprofitable for
private partnerships, and
were taken over by FSA.

Dorms soon became an
obvious necessity. The
Alumni Association had
built Pierce and Saylcs
Halls. but these two facil—
ities were inade'quate for
the growing student body.

Books, Food

FSA began to buy old
houses in the general
neighborhood of the old
campus to use for student
housing. In afew cases FSA
rented houses to sororities
and fraternities.

As FSA accumulated
money in excess of costs,
it started to branchoutinto
other areas of service to
the college community.
These include check cash—
ing service, short—term
lending, and accounting
services for organizations
on campus and for special
funds and gifts.

For the most part the
work of FSA was done.
without pay and after their
regular jobs, by the various
faculty and administration
members. Only recently
were permanent, salaried
employees hired when the
work of FSA became so
complex as to require this
change.

in a few weeks, by con:
tract with the State Uni-
versity of New York, the
Faculty .Student Associa-,-
tion will be officially rec-
ognized as an integral part
of the State University Sys-
tom.

Originally conceived as a self.
sufficient corporation to raise funds
for the good of the University it will
be allowed by the state to continue
to render the services that it has in
the past.

Outside of the Food Service and
the Bookstore few students realize
the scope of FSA activities. Among
the lesser known programs of the
Association are those provided for
the Faculty. Together with faculty
housing, the FSA furnishes emer-
gency loans to new faculty members
and funds for faculty research.

In addition, this new phase in its
deifelopment coincides with a variety
of new services to be offered with
the opening of the University Cen-
ter.

With the opening of the University

Center the Association will add a

Store. and Bowling Lanes.

art work for the campus, and var-
ious student affairs activities such
as conferenCes and lunches. '

Food Service Tries Hard

According to Malcolm Corbiey,
Manager of Food Service, Food
Service tries to do all it can to
benefit the University. Recently,
when several officials from Wash-
ington came to the University on
business concerning a grant of
$2,000,000, Food Service provided
coffee and a luncheon during the
two days they were here.

They did this in addition to pro-
viding the regular cash lines. .

Concerning the fact that the Food
Service had a profit of $775,000
last year, Corbiey said tha. ,

FSA Institutes» Pension Plan
For All Regular Employees

The Faculty Student Association
made effective October 1, 1065 a
pension plan which will benefit all the
regular employees of FSA. Less
than a year later, in July 1966,
FSA voluntarily entered upon apro-
gram of unemployuwnt insurance.

FSA inaugurated those plans for
the reason that it is impossible to
secure long term employees unless
it offers a benefit plan comparablc
to the plans offered by other em-
ployers.

This plan was set up with special
consideration for elnployecsoiFood
Service who had not been covered by
any similar type oi insurance pre-
vious to this.

Molar Expense

Theso employee benefit plans con-
stitute one of the major expenses
of the FSA budget, This money is
paid out of the gross amount of
assets taken in by all organs.

By spring '66 FSA had paid $75,000
of an initial post service liability
of $150,000 to the Connecticut Gen-
eral Life insurance Company for

the pension plan.

FSA bad also'paid $17,486 into
the unemployment insurance during
the course of the last academic
year.

The pension plan provides cov-
erage for any employee who has
completed at least 15 years of
service previous to the normal re—
quirement date.

Retlroment Benefits

Yearly retirement benefits them-
sevels will amount to 20% of the
first $4,800 of final earnings (the
highest average rate of earnings
on any five consecutive October 1's
during the last ten years before
retirement benefits).

The employee will also receive
50% of the excess of these earnings.

The retirement income may be
paid to the payee in level amounts
throughout the year, or may be cor-
related to Social Security benefits
or to a contingent nnnuitant option.

FSA offers other employee bene-

salarics and some of it has to be
kept in reserve for any contingen-
cies that may arise.

The rest of the money goes to
improving the service and benefiting
the University.

Complete Budget:

The manager mentioned the fact
that the budgets the Faculty Student
Association send him are very com-
plete and reliable. He knows in ad-
vance the number of students he
must feed and the number of meals
he has in the year. He must make

sure that the‘mone'y dues not run out‘ '

be'fore the year's end necessitating
economy meals.

Corbiey estimated that 58 to 60
per cent of his budget goes for food,
30 to 32 per cent for labor and the
rest for laundry, reiacement,
maintenance, and other similar ex-
penses.

An average of $1.30 is budgeted
for each student for each day. Break-
fasts average 46 to 48¢ and dinners
80 to 95¢.

Grade A Quality

Corbiey said that the Food Serv-
ice uses only grade 8 quality food
for its meals, but that since it
wants to keep the cost of room and
board down it cannot serve expen-
sive foods most of the time. Food
Service also saves by making its
own pastry and butchering some of
its own meat.

The manager feels that the meals
Food Service provides are good for
the price the student pays. lie ad-
mits that some cases of the food
tasting bad can be traced to mis-
takes in cooking and splcing the
food.

However, in many cases it is just
that Food Service does things dif-
ferently from what students are ac-
customed.

Al Davey, director of merchant-

dising services of the Faculty Stu-

dent Association, has high hopes

for the bookstore at the new Uni-
versity Center.

_ bookstore was" originally
formed by the faculty and students
on a non-profit basis to serve the
needs of both groups. Even afterthe
Faculty-Student Association was
formed, the bookstore worked fairly
autonomously, reporting mainly to
a Board of Managers who deter-
mined bookstore policy.

The former method of running
the bookstore was found to be un-
successful because there was no
profll and sometimes a loss of
money. The cashing of checks was
part of the bookstore function in
which expenses incurred did not
match the amount of money made.

Insufficient Funds

Because the bookstore did not
have enough money it could not ex-
pand as much as its managers
would have liked and until October
of 1964 when Mr. Brewer took over
as director, Dr. Collins headed
the coordination of the FSA.

The bookstore continued to be
semi-autonomous until last spring
when the need for organization in
the merchandising area became im-
perative.

When Bob Bell, former Bookstore
Manager, resigned Davey took over
as operational manager of thebook-
store. There followed a period of
organization in which inventories
were compiled and completed, after
which a period of planning ensued.

' " New Miidlondlse

Late in August, close to $300,000
worth of merchandise was moved
out to the New Campus.

The bookstore has made a con-
certed effort to supply the student
with needed goods (textbooks,school
materials and personal items).

This year's caricature contest
was held to initiate new ideas for
University products such as sweat-
shirts and penants.

The bookstore area of the Uni-
versity center will containamil
line of cosmetics for the girls plus
an expansion of the soft goods area. _
lt;will now include socks, blouses,
underwear and perhaps slacks'br
men and women. A more complete
film service and an enlarged an
counter, separate from jewelry will
. be included. «

Short ierm loan Plan fillers'
Emergency Fund for Students Use

The Faculty Student Association has established a

short—term, non-interest

loan service for students

with need of emergency funds. Any student enrolled
at the University in regular or summer session is
eligible. The basic purpose of this service is to pro-
vide money in an emergency situation to students who
are awaiting other forms of financial assistance, such
as National Defense Loans or scholarship checks.
The student may borrow up to 60 per cent of the ex-

pected funds.

Students who do not have
this guaranteed receipt of
money, may borrow up to
fifty dollars. In either case
the duration of the loan may

it should be emphasized that this
loan service is dependent on a re-
volving fund. The same money is
lent out over and over as it is ap-
plied for. If a student does not repay
the loan at the agreed time, another
student in desperate need may be
forced to wait.

Service is RnrltY

This service is a rarity at other
institutions. FSA-SUNYA, inc. has
recognized the need of many stu—
dents for emergency assistance in
financial matters. This is in addi-
tion to the involved and very lib-
eral deferment system which the
University administration has al-
relady provided for the payment of
bl is.
