' Incomprehensible

To the Editor:

The situation involved in the pre-
sentation of the so-called “Thanks-
giving Festival" is completely in-
comprehensible to me. The confu-
sion centers around the exact con-
traditions in University and New
York State policy on religious meet-
ings and services conducted on
State-owned property.

For this Thanksgiving Festival

Official Best Wishes

To the Editor:

It has come to our attention that
certain students at the State Uni-
versity of New York at‘ Albany were
involved in a slight "fracas”during
Tuesday’s general elections.

We, at Adirondack Community
College, feel that the plight of these
students affect all of us In some
manner or another.

We would like to officially- ex-
tend our best wishes to these stu-
dents who have seen fit, at personal
risk, to underscore a serious wrong
in our society.

year mostwere clamoring for more money.

If not enough students had paid toprovide the money

planned for,

budgets would have to have ben out even

more. This would have limited the activities available
to all students. Evidently the brochures sent out im—
pressed upon students the importance of this payment.

Perhaps students do not realize the significance and
worth of these- S.A. sponsored groups. They must be
benefiting from their organization. The spring semes-

ter. however, will be the crucial one. In order to ful-

fill the budgetary requirements. the tax for next se-
mester must be paid by hopefully an even greater

number of students.

Student tax allows many organizations to function
so let’s hope students continue to pay the tax and

support these groups.

 

The STATEment

lfhe Annual Stock Meeting

by Sherman Richard:

The meeting was set for the small
hours of the morning; secrecy was
of the uppermost importance. The
motel room swelled with people;
all were anxious to get started.

The chairman stood up. The room
turned its attention on him. “If a
count has been taken and everyone
is here, I’ll begin. I take it that
everyone is here. Very well.”

A hand raised from the populus.
The chairman recognized it. An old
familiar voice started, “I think we
all should make a concerted effort
to make this the best year ever.
We've all had a couple of good ones,
but let’s make this one top them
all."

The Chairman oi the Board

“Yes, we must do our best." The
chairman could always rely on that
old man to give some encouraging
words. “Our first order of business
will be racial-economic grouping.
I hope all of you read the new bulle-
tin; there have been several changes
since last year.

“Alright, now who wants to be in
group A?” Wait a minute now. There
obviously are too many people with
their hands up. Group "A" isavery
exclusive group. There is only room
for one percent of you.lguess in or-
der to cut down the size of this
group I’ll have to make the rule that
only those who were in group "A"
last year, or are the children ofone
of last year's group "A" members
can have that status this year.

"I see a lot of disappointed faces.
Is there anyone who objects to my
ruling? Well, then, it stands. We
might as well get the other extreme
done now. We always seem to have
troubles with the extremes.

“Will those who are willing to be
in group “L” please stand up. This
year I have enacted an increased
welfare benefit for those in group
"L." Come on people; why aren’t
you cooperating? I guess you’re
forcing me to do this. All those who
were in group "L" or were born to
a member of last year’s group "L"
will be in group ‘tL” this year.

“People, you had your choice, but
if you refuse to make it, I'll have to
make it for you.”

Obiectlon Overruled
At this point another hand raised
from the back of the populus. The
chairman recognized it. Anew voice
started, “Ever since I’ve been com-

.ing to these meetings, and that's been

ever since I was born,you’ve always
been chairman. How come we can't
elect a new chairman. it seems to
me only....."

The chairman broke in, "Nowyou
listen to me. I own this room and the
one above it. If you're living in my
universe, you live by my rules. If
you don’t like the rules, you can
get out, but you won’t be allowed to
take any of your possessions with
you. So either like it, or die.”

The new voice was silenced. The
chairman went on with the meeting.

An excellent display of painting
and sculpture by William Wilson
of the' art department can be seen
in the third floor lounge of the Hu-
manities Building. Wilson's work
was done during and shortly after
his trip to Mexico in the early part
of this year. ‘

Color Arrangements Striking

The arrangement of colors in the
paintings is very striking and Wilson
achieves a wide variety of moods
within a framework of tenseness
and motlonlessness and there is an
energy about them which comes from
the images of organic life.

The image can be that of a land-
scape, such as "Waterfall"or more
suggestive of the earthy Vitality con-
tained in a writhing body as in
"Tensions From Within." The tense
motion makes the picture seem as
if it wants to pull itself apart, destroy
itself, yet like so much that we know,
its turbulence is confined to an out
of frame.

“Fire Dance” is a mass oiseeth-
ing red liquid that seems to be
thrown at the viewer, coming right
out of the picture. The dark blue
and green background lends an om-
inous tone to mood.

Sculpture Exhibited

In addition to the paintings, sev-
eral pieces of sculpture are included
in the show. The sculpture is of
faces and is done in stone.

The natural shape has been altered
as little as possible and the faces of
the people blend into their origins,
stones of the earth.

MEMORANDUM REHEARSALS ARE now in full swing for the Da-

cember performance. Both full cost and individual rehearsals are

going well.

Christmas Day" will once again be
sung, this time however, with a
brass ensemble accompaniment.
Another number with a brass group
is Michael Praetorius’ "in Dulci
Jubllo" from "Musae Sioniae, Part
II." This piece will be done in the
original Latin and German text.

Another traditional number is
“Alleluia” by Heinrich Schultz.
Written to glorify God, this song
consists of a single word. A varia-
tion on “Alleluia” is seen in “Sing
liollylon” from Richard Hulsler’s
Christmas play “The llallowed
Time.” The unusual intervals and
harmony lend a unique atmosphere
to this beautiful song.

Folk Corals Add Vorloty

Contrastng with the classical and
contemporary numbers are the tra-
ditional foil: carols. "The Manger
Carol.“ a gently rocking Austrian
Yule Iiymu, sings of the r-ulm peace
which surrounded Jesus in thomun-
gar. ,

in direct ('oml‘ost to the mood set
by this li'liilliinll.rl lullaby is the
English Cnrol “Landlord Fill the
Flowing Bowl.” This is a vel‘ylive-
ly song curling with the maxim “For
tonight we’ll merry, merry lie/To—
morrou' we’ll be sober."

New Pieces Included

Another innovation is the lilting
“lliuiukkah Madrigal,” "Mi Y’Mai-
lei,” to be sung by the chorus in
the original Hebrew text. Cheryl
Hickman will he the soloist.

The three accompanisis are Julia
Creighton, a piano major, Louise
Kracke; and Jolm Spross, who is
entering his third year as chorus
accompanist. The conductor of this
group is Professor of Music, Karl
A. E. Peterson, who also directs
the smaller men’s group, "The
statesmen.”

Art Depi.Announces
December Exhibit

The Art Department at the State
University of New York at Albany
announces that its December ex-
hllzltiun will feature the paintings
of John llosson, instructor of Art.

The opening reception for the
artist will he held on December 1,
from 8—]0p.m. in the Faculty Lounge
of the Humanities liuilding.

Mr. iiosson, a new member of
the Art Department Faculty, ro-
ceiveri his undergraduate education
at the Cooper Union in New York.
He was the recipieniofthe Fulbright
grant to study at the University of
Paris in 1963-4 and completed his
M.I“,A. at Cornell University in
1966.

The artist’s work has been in-
cluded In exhibitions at the Aspen
Gallery, Aspen, Colorado, the Mun-
son Williams Proctor Gallery, Utica
and the Everson Museum in Syra-
cuse. The exhibit here at Albany
State will be his third one-man
show.

The Bosson Exhibit will be open
from eight to five daily during De-
cember, 1066,

Never, I think. in the last ten years has alpicture ,.
of such limited merit as Paramount's “Alfie” been
received so enthusiastically ,by public and critics
alike. From coast to coast, and even ocean to ocean.
the Michael Caine (“Ipcress File,” “The Wrong
Box”) starrer has been adored by slobbering critic ‘

until their pens have run dry of superlatives.
This is a great film, they '

tell us. There are mes-
sages here of such dra-
matic and sociological im-
port that they cannot be
denied or ignored.

The Cockney anti-hero‘s asides
to the audience are to be, or rather
must be, taken as precious morsels
of wisdom, as the golden words of
some unwilling sage who scarcely
realizes the Great Truths he is
voicing.

Few Words oi Truth

Some of this may indeed be right
to a point. Somewhere among the
tons of verbage spilled over this
film there may be a few words of
truth. For there Is mess'age in
“Alfie;” but it is so absurdly ob-
vious and superficial as to be al-
most unworthy of mention.

Maybe you have heard the story
before. A lower-class Casanova
goes through a procession of wo-
men, loving them, hurting them,
leaving them. He has a fine time
Ilecause he is so busy looking out
for himself that he is never aware
of the pain he is inflicting on others.

"Becomes Involved"

Then one day he “becomes in-
volved" with one of them, sees what
an awful beast he has become. l-le
realizes that his life has been a
sham, that he has been a heartless
fool. And then, after reaching this
momentous pinnacle of self-real-

'lzation, he decides to amend his

life and become one of society’s
Good People.
Surely this must be one of film’s

it is one that has been with its long.
before the cinema even developed
as an art form. 1, ‘

And yet "Alfie" does not even
seem to fulfill this simple formula.
For at the end of the film, after
all his “birds,” after all the people
he has hurt or degraded, even after
the shock' of the unborn child he has
helped to kill, one still is left with
annoying question--has he changed
at all?

Change Momentary

Granted, there is a momentary
change, a shock, a moment of pro-
found and genuine anguish. But all
too soon it has worn off and Alfie
again talks about the whole episode
as he would about a traffic ticket
or a bad tooth. .

Alfie, then, does not grow in
stature because of his recognition
of the consequences of his behavior.
.Before that moment he could 'be
pitied, could be excused, for his
actions on the assumption that he
did not know any better. And in that
respect, he could be looked upon as
an impish, mischievous rogue, a sort
of modern-day Tom Jones.

Crucial Moment

But after that supposedly crucial
moment in his life,‘ after he‘ has
realized but not amended, seen the
writing on the wall and Ignored it,
he becomes not impish but vulgar,
not amusing but appalling. He he-
comes a small man, a pitiless man.

Whether this was the way play-
wright Blll Naughton wanted it to
he is not important. The film Is as
it is, and all the superlatives in the
dictionary cannot'change that fact.
It is a small film about every small
man.

 

most basic plot formulas; indeed,

on stage

.

When Barbara Harris does a new
show, that's news. And when Mike
Nichols directs it, that’s more news.
So it Is not suprislng that “The
Apple Tree," now playing at the
Schubert Theatre, has gotten so
much publicity; it boats horh big
names, plus the added boost of Alan
Alrln and Larry Blyden.

Though It opened to mixed re-
views, “The Apple Tree” - a trio
of musical one-acts - has much to
commend it. First, of course, there
is Miss llarris, whose pertness and
voice can fill any stage adequately.
Then there are the shows themselves
which range from ho-hum to WOW.

Probably the weakest of the three
is the middle offering, :1 nothing-
new—Io-say rendition of “The Lady
and the Tiger.” No amount of navel
display can conceal the fact that
there is very little to he said for
the tale.

The same is not true of the Jules
l-‘elffer piece, “Passionella,” the
girl with the loo-inch bust (at least
between the hours of Huntley-Brink-
lay and the Late, Late Show), but
here the most noteworthy aspect
(despite some wonderful clowning
by Miss Harris) are the on-stage
film techniques.

Somehow or other .it seems too
much 0 a concession to the other
side to suggest that the live ac-
tors are not enough. However, the
first piece is excuse enough for all
the others. '

“The Diary of Adam and Eve"
has not been too popular with the
critics. They say it is too senti-
mental, but therein lies its appeal.
In a theatre devoted to alienation,
how wonderful to find a play we can
feel with, that reminds us that we,
too, know humor, grief, and most
important, love.

IN ADDITION TO the very Iucceuiul poster display in November,
the Art Coordination Committee have placed on weriu on diapie
In CoIonIoi Quad. They suggest that groups study paintings and

contribute to help the committee.
