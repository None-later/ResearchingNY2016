< Our school does not support its wrestling team to ’
any appreciable degree. Last year some matches
.Were moderately attended largely because certain fans
were willing to delay returning to the dorms after
school to watch the team perform. We have our doubts
about any self-sacrifice being exhibited this year.

The Dane wrestling team has an abundance of talent
this year and should register a very successful sea-
son. It is a pity that so few people will avail them-
selves to see the squad in action.

We are not calling for anyone topush aside his self-
ish ways and actively support these men. we are
merely expressing our respect for these dedicated
athletes and pledging our utmost support toward their

efforts.

A. A. Board has just announced that it will provide
bus service to and from Hudson Valley Community
College for all 10 of State’s home basketball games.
The Board will decide today as to the number of
busses to be made available and the schedule of ar-
rival and departure. The schedule will be posted after

Thanksgiving. .

We are confident right now that no one will be com-
pletely pleased with the decisions made on this mat-
ter. We just hope that the Board considers the most
good for the largest number in decidingon this matter.

Sunday’s playoff game between Potter Club and

Alpha Pi Alpha fraternities for the AMA League I
championship has all the makings of being one of the
greatest games ever played in the league. In their
previous two encounters. the two teams split closely
contested games. APA is eager to score its first
championship triumph while Potter is out to regain

its title. lost last season.

The game will begin at 2 p.m. down on the athletic
field. This one’s for all the marbles, and don’tyou

think both teams don’t know it.

MATMAN ART RECESSO, the team's l67-pounder, ll caught mong-

defeated the GDI's by the score of
7-0. By winning the championship
the filters became the'first inde-
pendent team to win afoothali crown

second quarter, when tiller quarter-
back Jim Naibie hit spl-t and Rich
Patrol with an aerial that the lanky
sophomore grabbed on the 10 yard
line and then ran it in the rest of
the way. The extra point came via

 

a run around and by blocking back
John liowlund.

()nco ugnin the winners defense
was again outstanding. Time and
time again, the front four tagged
GDI quarterbacks Dave Deal) and
Pete DiGlocoino for big losses;
When the GDI quarterbacks did get
the passes off the defensive back-
field anchored by Jim Winslow had
the receivers covered like ablunkot
so that many passes were broken
up and fell incomplete.

In winning the championship, the
69ers ended the season with a 0-1
record. The only loss was to Water-
bury, 12-7, on a 70 yard combina-
tion pass-run play with seven sec-

Birth Control is the subject of
the first of a series of "Insight"
programs sponsored by Psi Gam-
ma Sorority. “An Insight into Birth
Control" will be presented on Sun-
day, December 11, at 7:30 p.m. in

Lecture Room 3 and is open to the
University.

Mrs. Crawford Campbell, wife of
a noted gynecologist and pediatrician
and a past national secretary of
Planned Parenthood Association,
will present an introductory film,
"A Fair Chance" and a discussion
of the philosophy of intelligent fam-
ily planning and the methods ofbirth
control.

She maintains that, "All intelli-
gent young people should have access
to blrih control information and use
it as they see fit."

Mrs. Campbell has traveled ex-
tensively and lectured abroad as
well as in the United States. she
first became interested in family
planning after living in South Chi-
cago and meeting face-to-face “the
tragedy of unwanted children." She
has since been active in the local,
state, and national agencies of
Planned Parenthood.

, Also on hand to answer questions
will be Father Paul Smith, the Rev-
erends Frank Snow and William
Small, Dr. Ethel Cermak of the
University Infirmary, and Dr. John
Tucker of the Counseling Service.

In presenting the "Insight" ser-
ies Psi Gamma hopes to contribute

to the intellectual and cultural as-
pects of the University Community.

Future programs are being planned
and their success depends on Uni-
versity support.

Quota 0f NDEA Fellowships

Increased For

The quota of National Defense Ed-
ucation Act Fellowships, which are
alloted to the University to award
for individual work on the graduate
level, has been increased substan-
tially for the '67-'08 academic year.

President Collins, announced at
Monday’s President’s Conference
that the University will receive
thirty-two grants to be awarded
next year as opposed to the six
grunts awarded to the University
this year.

The fellowships are designed to
increase the number of scholars in
certain approved graduate fields,
in order to ultimately provide an
increase in the number of touch-
ers at the college level.

The program is also designed to
support new graduate programs in
that the department receives a sit-
pend for each fellowship awarded
to an individual which allows for
growth in that area.

Three Year Basis

The fellowships are awarded on
a three year basis and should enable
the holder to complete the academic
credits necessary for obtaining a
doctorate.

The University is approved for
study in 12 fields, whereas the State
University at Buffalo is approved in
20 fields, Stoney Brook in (l, and
iiurpur in 3.

President Collins also discussed
a Faculty conference which was held
in order to provide the faculty with
a chance to discuss various ques-
tions with the President.

University

Around 150 members of the fac-
ulty were present and among the
main topics discussed was the Uni-
versity policy on the releasing of
organization lists to the llouseCom-
mlitee on Un-American Activities.

Discussion Arose

Discussion arose over whether
the University would release the
names of students who were meni-
bers of organizations which the
House Committee considered pos-
sibly tin-American in policy on sub-
poena as was the case at Berkeley
and other universities.

Collins stated that under ourcon-
stitution providing for Student or-
ganizations no sueh membership
lists are requisite for ihe Univer-
sity file, and in such case the Uni-
versity simply Would not have any
lists to release.

Student Arrest!

Another topic of discussion was
whether the arrest of a student in
any way affected the standing of a
student in the University. Collins
stated that a student arrest does
not in any way affect the students
University standing.

In such a case of student arrests
no evidence of arrest is put on his
University record.

The names of those faculty and
administrative members serving on
the committee for the formulation of
a liquor policy chaired by Neil
Brown of Student Activities were
also released.

Child Buyer."

Grannell's activity in summer
theatres has included acting inRob-
ert Sherwood’s “The Petrified For-
est," and winters he has performed
at the Erie and Pittsburgh Play-
houses. According to "Royal Gam-
bit's" director, Samuel B. Morrell,
the Galaxy Players are delighted
with Grannell’s performance in
early rehearsals where he has
proven to be “an intelligent, re-
sponsive actor.”

Along with Mr. Grannell, the reg-
ular players of the Galaxy troupe
will be featured in "Royal Gambit."
The cast includes: Pamela Morrell
as Katerina of Aragon; Dorice Nel-
son as Anne Boleyn; Jinx Linden-
nuer as Jane Seymour; Mary Han-
non as Anna of Cloves; Marion Fos-

matlcs Council of the State Univer-
sity of New York at Albany, will be

ment of the Madison Avenue Presby-
terian Church, 820 Madison Avenue.

In the 1964 Down Beat Critic’s
poll Woods placed number three on
alto saxophone, ahead of such ar-
tists as Cannonball Adderley and
Paul Desmond. In the same poll he
placed sixth on clarinet ahead of
Benny Goodman. In the most recent
poll be has slipped to no. 5' on alto,
but had risen to fifth on clarinet.

Critics have lavished Woods with
much praise. Leonard Feather,
author of the “Encyclopedia of
Jazz,” says Woods "plays with soul,
fire, melodic ingenuity and complete
command."

The Associate Editor of "Down
Beat," Dan Morgenstern, remarks
that “all his solos are remarkably
well-structured statements, played
with the assurance and control of a
master instrumentalist, yet retain-
ing the fire and conviction of his
earlier work."

Woods most recent venture has
been playing lead alto in the score
far the movie "Alfie." Michael
Zwerin, jazz columnist of the “Vil-
lage Voice," in reviewing the score
said "Phil Woods lead alto is im-
peccable."

He has had musical instruction at
the Juliiard School, the Manhattan

School of Music, plus private in-
struction from Lennie Tristano, an
early proponent of modern jazz.

lie has played with such greats
as Dizzy Gillespie, Buddy Rich and
Quincey Jones. Woods was an inti-
mate friend of Charlie Parker, the
father of modern jazz; and is stop-
father to the late Parker's young
son.

Presently the thirty-five year old
Woods resides in his native Spring- '
field, Massachusetts.

Tickets for the concert ﬁre still
available in Humanities 140 for
$1.25. At the door the price will be
$1.50.

Intestinal Viral Infection
Strikes Waterbury Hail

The confusion and questions re-
sulting from the disease which
struck residents of the Downtown
Campus were dispelled by President
Collins at the Monday press confer-
ence when he stated the cause of
illness had been identified as viral
intestinal infection.

The "plague" that struck Water-
bury Hall on the morning of Nov. 22
turned out to be a viral disease.
However, it was serious enough to
force the hall to be closed.

At 4:30 am. of that morning, all
the residents of Waterbury received
notices informing them Dr. Janet
Iiomi, director ofhealth service, had

 

 

 

 

ordered the hall closed. This notice
also contained instructions froni Dr.
Hood, telling students who had not
yet become sick to leave as soon as
possible.

Warn Drivers

The doctor also warned them that
if going by car, they should have
more than one driver since the virus
strikes suddenly, leaving one too ill
to drive.

0n the same day, health officials
came to inspect the kitchen. As far
as Waterbury Hall Director James
llayes knows, nothing was found
wrong with the food, thereby elim-
inating the possibilities of food
poisoning.

Of all the residents of Waterbury,
Hayes estimates about 100 students
alone were sick by early Tuesday
morning. In addition, seine students
contracted the disease after they
left, bringing the total to over 100.

Among the residents who caught
the "plague" was Herb Hersch, who
complained there were not enough
people to care for those who were
sick. lie was also wondering what
would have happened if it had beena
serious disease.

Longer Vacation

liis roommate Gary Welnbergei'
could only say "The results of this
virus were like those of a beer
party, only there was none that
Monday night." Those students who
did not get sick received an extra
day and a hall of vacation.

One such student, Mike Egleston,
said that because of the virus he
gained an extra two days for drink-
ing back home in Amsterdam. When
everyone returned on Sunday, the
"plague" was the major topic of
conversation. Seine still insisted it
was caused by the food.
