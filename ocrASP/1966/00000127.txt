IF G Weekend Program
To Feature Crime Movie,

"Touch of Evil," an unusual crime
thriller, is this week's presentation
of the International Film Group.

Starring Orson Welles, Charlton
Heston, and Janet Leigh, the film
tells a story of greed and corrup-
tion. Welles plays Hank Quinlan, a
cynical detective in a Mexican bor-
der town, whose habit is to plant
evidence on suspects to gain an
easy conviction.

A narcotics investigator (Charl-
ton Heston) vacationing in the town
becomes suspicious of Quinlan's
methods, and the rest of the film is
a tense duel between them.

The film was also directed by
Welles, and “Touch of Evil” is full
of characteristic moments -- bar-
oque lighting, bravura camerawork,
and incisive dialogue.

Student ProliIonis
To Be Explored
By Questionnaire

Student problems is the main,
the only, interest of a recently or-
ganized group. Mark Zeek and
John Fieitman, students, have joined
Christos Apostle of the sociology
department to attempt to solve or
alleviate problems which may be
plaguing students.

A clinic and a questionnaire will
be the major means of solution. Any
student with a problem may obtain
a questionnaire beginning Tuesday
from Mark Zeek at 472-8744, Fleit-
man at 472-5255 in Waterbury Hall,
or Apostle in SS 3'74.

After filling out the questionnaire,
students may obtain personal guid-
ance from the group or an imper-
sonal response depending upon the
individual’s wish. There will be a
$1.00 fee for the solution of the

These arrests were made despite
the fact that the Office of tilestnte’s
Attorney General had'informed the
pickets that their action, inasmuch
as it did not constitute partisan po-
litical behavior, was unquestionably
legal provided access to the polls
was in no way obstructed (as it was
not).

The seventeen men in this group
were subjected to the indignity of
handcuffing and to hours of detention
in jail cells, some extremely dirty.
All twenty were then brought before
Judge Segal who, although the
charges had been withdrawn by the
Police, took it upon himself to re-
prove them in severe language.

We can discover no justification
whatever either for the initial arrest
or for Judge Segal's subsequent as-
sumption of the guilt of the twenty.

illegal way intimidating the voters

appears to be totally without founda-

We feel, therefore, that the auth-
orities responsible for these actions
have a definite obligation to the
community to explain why they oc-
curred, and, if no reasonable justi-
fication can be offered (and we cannot
conceive of what this could be), then
to make public apiogy for this repre-
hensible violation of civil liberties.

Furthermore, we feel that every
trace of this unjust arrest must be
expunged from the records of the
twenty. it would be unforgiveable if
any member of the group at any
time failed to get a job or suffered
some other ill—effect because this
absurd arrest was on his record.
