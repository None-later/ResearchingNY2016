Acting, Directing Present Problems
Hard Work, Nightly Rehearsals

by Ed Lunge

A play is a collage, that is. it is an
eclectic assortment of many dramatic
factors, both glamorous and for the
most part, unglamorous. Acting and di-
recting are probably most often con-
sidered as the glamorous aspects. As
right or incorrect as this may be, hard

and long 3work is 'not unknown to theU

people working these areas.

If reading, rereading and rereading a
script is considered glamorous. then the
most elementary aspects of directing are
just that. If the hours which are spent
planning blocking, casting, andhammer—
ing out details with technical personnel
are considered glamorous then the basic

foundations of direction are just that.
If hours of nightly rehearsal for sev~

eral weeks. and studying a script in
"spare" time, and building a character
are considered glamorous, then acting
and directing are glamorous.

If, after weeks of hard work, two
minutes of applause is considered glam—
orous, and is supposed to make all that
has past worth the work, then acting and
directing are glamorous. Is it glamor-
ous? No, but some people love it anyway,
and an example of these people are the

director and cast of THE MEMORAN-

 MEMORANDUM is a play strongly
dependent on characterization for much
of its humor. Herein lies one of the prob-
lems encountered'by the cast and direc—

» tor of the show. Often. a play’s humoris
more inherent in the lines and action

then, it is in MEMORANDUM; however:
in this play much of the humor comes
from the audience’s enjoyment of the
humorous types of characters: the jet
set, the mod, the former phys. ed. ma-
jor and others.

MEMORANDUM also introduces ano-
ther problem to both actor and director.
The play is concerned with an artificial
language which had to be learned so that
when actors eonversed in it, it would
seem natural and not stilted. This was a
primary factor since the play’s main
theme is concerned with this language.

Rehearsals also presented a problem
since several members of the cast of
MEMORANDUM were also actors in the
University’s last show, LYSISTRATRA,
and both plays were in rehearsal at the
same time. This forced afternoon re-
hearsals. and double time work on the
part of actors.

It is hoped that on the
appointed night our theatre
goer will arrive, be
amused, and be drawn into
the magical existence that
only the live theatre can
offer.

Much has been done, just in the
technical aspects of the production
of this English language premiere,
to make this evening at. the theatre
rewarding and highly entertaining.
Planning for anything as complex
as the running of “The Memoran-
dum," even though it is considered
a fairly simple show technically, had
to begin months ago.

Design Concept

First began the design concept
planning with Ted Closet of theatre
graphics and the technical director,
Robert Donnelly both conferring with
Jarka M. Burian, the director of
the' production. The overall color
scheme of blue-grey was chosen
and the publicity and program for-
mat was designed and printed.

While this was being completed
Donnelly worked out the set design
and drafted the many sets of plans
necessary for its construction.
Again there were conferences with
both the director and with Jerome
Henley, the lighting director.
Henley, like Donnelly, came toState
from Dartmouth.

Building, Painting
After planning came the actual
building and painting of the set.
Since the play is about the pitfalls
of bureaucracy and takes place in
an office, the design idea was to give

the office an “institutional” look.‘

The result is something that is very
much like early Montgomery Ward.
The problem of finding the insti-
tutional looking furniture was sihiply
resolved by a quick look around the
old campus. Anything that could not
be found had to be built, and manin
the pieces that were availablehadto
be repaired before they were serv-
iceable for use on the stage.

Space Problem
The problem of space has been a
bother, as always, in the Richard-
son Studio Theatre.There is solittle
room to the sides and behind the
acting area that set changing plans
remind one of a sliding square block

“The Memorandum”

is being presented.

pozzle. The limited space above the
stage is a factor that thelightingde-
signer must work around also.

The lighting design follows the
“institutional look" idea with bright
overhead lighting to reinforce the
six white overhead lamp globes
which are hung inanoffice-like man-
ner above the stage. In order to
properly light the Richardson Studio
Theatre it is necessary to mount
instruments above the audience.

While not a problem, the fact that
the audience can see these light
sources detracts from the effective-
ness of the theatre in many plays.
In any case it cannot be avoided,
Once the lights are set and are
plugged into the control panel the
stage is ready.

Technical Weekend
Now the problem at hand is the
“technical weekend”. All the fin-
ishing touches to the set must be
completed and the technical run-
through and dress rehearsals fol-
low. Next the performance.

Time as well as planning is re-
quired to carry out all of these in-
volved tasks. The directors and
assistants work as much as 60 to
100 hours a week before a perfor-
mance. The Stagecraft crew and the
volunteers are to be commended for
their fine work also.

' lltttarsals _ Indicate '

Pdittei'i'oriormrnoe
in opening ‘ lliglil

by Jill Paan‘lh

- Chuck Bartlett, Robert Cutty, and
Mort Hess are the leading actors
in the Czechoslovakian play “The
Memorandum” which is in its final
week of rehearsals. All consider
the progress made in rehearsal to
indicate a polished performance.

Chuck Bartlett feels that it is a
fascinating play and "a profitable
experience for anyone to see.” The

‘ magnitude of his part makes it the

most difficult role he has ever
played. Paradox and contradiction
appear in the Character Gross that
Chuck portrays.

Chuck is a drama major and has
acted in "Of Mice and Men," “Le
Misanthrope," “Lysistrata” and
several other plays.

Robert Cutty, who has had exper-
ience in the Freshman Skit and .13
says the play is cominglnto sharper
focus now. He plays the part of the
classic professor, the “perfect ped-
agogue” who enlilessly talks about
Ptydepe-a new language. Hie cos-
tume appears respectable yet has a
threadbare quality to it.

Mort Hess, a graduate of Albany
State, is happy to be working with
Dr. Barton again. He feels that the
play is interesting and calls for
depth and maturity on the part of
the audience.

His is the role of the "heavy;”
the character he portrays “tends to
dramatize himself." Mort is a mem-
ber of the Albany Civic Theatre and
has acted in The Arena.“'l‘he play,"
he says, "will be in good shape for
opening night and he is looking for-
ward to its run."

New Ofﬁcial Language Adopted

To Improve Communications

by Jacqueline Berger

“Abagan fajfor?” “La-
gorax Nagypl ” “Gun snoj-
vep?” “Snojvep yjl ”

No. it’s not Pig Latin.
nor is it a Zwaheli dialect.
and it certainly isn’t the
latest teenybop fad.

it is, however, a new of-
ficial language that the ad-
ministration is introducing
into our University on Dec.
6. Its purpose is to make
official communication
more exact and technical.

Keeping up with the
times? Well. we are living
in the age of computers
and considering that we
have recently experienced
an electronic concert spon-
sored by the Music De-
partment. it is rather com-
plimentary that the drama-
tics department is intro-
ducing a scientific lan-
guage.

Just exactly who knows
Ptydepe? Only the cast of
“Memorandum” and Dr.
Burian, its director. And
just what is their opinion
of Ptydepe?

According to Professor
Fisher (played by Robert

. new»

,,

Cutty), the esteemed Doc—
tor of Ptydepe: “t is cer-
tainly frnygko jefr dabux
altep dy savarub goz tex-
eresl "

And how are its students
reacting to it?

Prof. Fisher: Why don’t
we ask Tensil, my Ptydepe
Protige. Tensil?

Tensil: I am very proud
to be one of the first stu-
dents to master the lan-
guage.

Unfortunately. everyone
does not have so favorable
an opinion of Ptydepe as do
Dr. Fisher and Tensil,

Mr. Gross (played by
Chuck Bartlett). as man-
aging director would you
care to make a statement
concerning the introduction
of this new official lan-
guage.

Mr. Gross: I am a hu-
manist and as a humanist
I am opposed to the intro-
duction of any artificial
tongue. What do I think of
Ptydepe? What do I think
of Ptydepe?  Gotrech!

I beg your pardon!

"The Memorandum," by Vaclav Havel, is a repre- ‘
sentative of a new source of dramatic writing for the
American theatre. The English language premiere.
performance by the University Theatre brings the
drama of Communist'Czechoslovakia to an American
audience which has had little past experience with

plays from this area.

In the past the drama of
Slovakian Europe, with the
exception of Russia. has
been of little interesttothe
West. But today a new and
exciting dramatic form has
replaced the communist in-
spired Social Realism of
the 1950’s.

This is a drama of social com-
ment and reform through anology by
satire. "The Memorandum” is of
this school of drama and, according
to Jarka M. Burian, the play'sdirec-
tor, one of the best of the new
Czechoslovakian plays of last
season.

The play speaks out against the
tendency of a very highly bureau-
cratic organization to allow the de-
humanizatlon of its members. in-
directly the author shows how the
very structure of the organization
allows its members to accept the
fact that a few, perhaps the wrong
few, are able to gain its control.

The Communist hold over dra-
matic literature in Czechoslovakia
has lessened, but not yet so much
that such criticisms could be so
openly stated. Thus the analogy of
the office is used.

Drone Praised
A: latest Product
Of Czech Writer

Played previously in Czechoslo-
vakia and West Berlin, “The Mem-
orandum" is the latest product of
contemporary Czechoslovakian
playwright. Vaclav Havel. .

Havel has done one other full-
length play and is closely related
to avant-gnrde theatre in Prague.
This latest play, a satiric farce,
shows the result ofallowingamech-
anlstic regime to make people into
mere "creatures of function."

The nature of the play, since it
criticizes any bureaucratic regime,
indicates a certain degree of free-
dom in Czechoslovakia, but it also
shows the ingenuity an author must
use to avoid censorship.

Dr. Jarka M. Burian, thedirector
first became familiar with "The
Memorandum," while teaching in
Czechoslovakia last year, when he
saw the play produced and met the
author. He describes Havel asbeing
a "young, American football t e in
appearance" who holds the position
of drmaturg for the Theatre of the
Balustrade, a repertory theatre in
Prague.

THE BUILDING OF I! set requires skills very different from
those at the actor. Much carpentry work must be done belore

a production can be staged.

Costumes Show

Conservatism

Styling Mostly Contemporary

Costuming, it seems, is either
done on a grand and showy scale
or obtains little or no recognition.
If this is true, then the costumes
for, “Memorandum” would go com-
pletely unnoticed for they repre-
sent contemporary styling and, ex-
cept for one or two cases, can-
servatism.

In order to coordinate the cos—
tume with the characterization Miss
Patrizia von Brandenstein, a pro-
iessiohal designer has been re-
tained. After considering all facets
of the production she decides what
clothing and accessories are to be
used.

Costume Parade
After costumes have been chosen
and contributed, bought or made,
time is set aside for a “costume
parade" at which the cast try on

.their dramatic dress for the first

time.

Often one or two scenes are
played to allow the actors and ac-
tresses to become used to working
in their costumes and to discover
how they look under stage lighting.

During, the “costume parade,"

the designer, Miss Von Branden-
stein and the director, Dr. Jarka
M. Burian confer and remedy any
problems which occur in the actual
placing of the costumes into the set.
Sizes are also checked and altera—
tions made. All costuming sessions
after this "parade" are merely to
sew buttons and ripped hams.

Stage Dress

In fitting the stage dress to the
character, several interesting out-
fits have been eveioped. The “eager
beaver" who is characterized as
being “poor but very neat" wears
a iln'oadbare but wellupressed suit.
His shoes are rundown but polished
and his impeccably starched collar
is worn.

The Doctor of Ptydepe, the young
“latest thing" of the business world,
is costumed in a mod-outfit com-
plete with hip-buggers and a wild
lie. The secretary wears a simple
office dress, as befits a simple
girl: skirt, blouse and sweater.

Colors tend to greys and blues
and the clothes were also chosen
with consideration to the age of the
character portrayed.
