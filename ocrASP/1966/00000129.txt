WHO IS COOL:

We find a great controversy among
college students today over who is
or is not cool, gear, gr00vy, hip,tn,
camp, neat, ad nauseum. For t
sole purpose of adding to the con-
fusion and displaying our muddled
cognitions, we present our 1966 of

back) is cool for having a 10 inch
Nick Dame fur living room rug.

a skin tight uniform. Fernanda Walt-
mtller is cool because we love her.

Jennifer Brain, I9, of Worcester-

SEVERAL MORE RUMORS WE
HAVE HEARD:

Psi Gam is still on campus.

Due to the courageous action of
Erotiers and several Albany State

able to start the performances on
time. Not only did the first perfor-
mance not start on time, but we
were not able to open the doors
until amost 8:00 p.m. for the 7:30
concert. I realize it was quite cold
outside and would like to thank
everybody who had to stand outside,

for their patience. Even after the
concert got underway, we still had
trouble with the sound. The problem

on

was the size of the speakers.
seems that last semester a new
sound system was put into Page Hall
and this semester the new, and
smaller, speakers were put in place.

For the second performance an
additional speaker was added which

was a slight improvement. Part of
the problem was that S.U.N.Y.A.
has never had a group like Jay and
the Americans with their loud elec-
tric guitars, and to be quite frank

we were caught off guard.The prob-
lems We experienced will be cor-
rected for all of our subsequent
concerts this year in Page Hall.

The amplifier for the electric gui-
tar, brought by Jay and the Amer-
icans, was turned down as low as
it would go, and our sound system
was turned up as loud as it would

trying conditions.

ISTA'I‘I'I‘I'O

by Sherman Richards

There is a mad genius who walks
among us. His posture is bent as
though he carries a heavy load-on
his book. His clothes are old and
baggy. His face is filled with lines.

His voice is soft; he rarely yells.
He spoke to me yesterday. “I am
disappointed with you.”

I was surprised thathewas speak-
ing to me, but I asked him why he
was disappointed. He answered,
“Because you write a column, but
do mining."

I didn't know what to reactto first,
the fact that he was criticizing me,
or the fact that I had never met him
before and he seemed to know me.

I asked how he knew that I wrote
a column. "That," he said, “Is
quite obvious. You just look like you
do. ’

Then I wanted to know how he
could make the statement that i do
nothing. He replied, "Well you
do anything?"

I tried to fight the feeling, but!
felt insulted. I came back with,
“Well what do you do?"

My question didn’t bother him
as I had hoped it would. He just
answered, “I work for PROGRESS."

I asked him who or what is pro-
gress. “Oh, it’s a little group I
started myself. I picked the name

"I try to give them ideas as to

they need help with the use of

toward doing what was done before.
It's like betting today on yester-
day's winners. You bet on them
because you're sure beyond any
doubt that they are winners.

“I try to wake them up to today's
race; if you know what I mean. i
usually stand off in the corner and
tell them my ideas. Most of the
time, though, they don't hear me.
I try, but they just don't listen."

'For a second I thought I could
detect a little futility in his voice,
but suddenly he looked me in the
eye and said, “Well, i've got to be

and I’ve got a new idea.”

I wanted to ask him what his
new idea was, but he had already
moved away. We will eventually

'Analysis: Riots And Rioters

Campus indilumllints Compared

by Peter Pailak

In the academic community ofthis
country there are many who accept
student riots as a product of spring
fever and youthful naivete, while at
the same time they condemn the
riots in the slums and support the
Congressional slow down on civil
rights legislation.

However, rioting on campus and
rioting in the ghetto have many
parallel characteristics worth ex-
amlnlng.

Two prevalent attitudes taken by
public critiques towards rioting are
that they are the result of minor
grievances and that they are a way
of letting out tensions. Some minor
grievances attributed to students
are college housing and hours regu-
lations, food, and lack of recrea-
tional facilities.

On the grievances in the ghettos,
some people mention the summer
heat without adequate recreational
areas for the slum youth.

Letting Out Tensions

That riots are a way of letting out
tensions has a great deal of validity
in either case. However, those who
bring up this point often have an un-
realistic view of the nature of the
rioting.

Letting out tensions by taking a
long walk, playing football, or having
a few beers is quite different from
the violent, uncontrollable attack on
property and human life that takes
place in a riot.

The distinquishing factor in nrlot
is the desperation of the rioter - the
abandon of reason and concern.Stu-
dent and slum rioters showindtffer-
ence to property and human life and
they riot in disobedience of police
and administrators, alike.

Explode Against Demands

Both groups often explode against
some absurd demand by the local
power structure. Student riots often
Occur during the tithe when an ab-
surd importance is placed on final
exams.

And ghetto riots often explode
against the absurd injunction of a
mayor telling the people to use nor-
mal procedures to protest tlrepollco
shooting of a car thief suspect.

Other common characteristics
can be drawn between the ribters
and the power structure they seem
to be rioting against. Students are
often chided by deans and professors
for apathy towards the values that
are supposed to play an important
part in their future life, such as
learning, religion, cleanliness, and
even athletics.

A similar attitude of apathy is
reported about the poor by their
social workers, teachers, and min-
isters. The only two areas about
which students and the poor are not
always apathetic are their social life
and a chance for financial gain.

Outside Groups

Another characteristic of the so-
ciety of rioters is the outside com-
mitment of small groups which are
attracted to or form organizations
highly critical of the power struc-
ture. These few often have an al-
most religious commitment to an
ethical, selfless way of life in re-
bellion to the values of the society.
In the civil rights marches several
summers ago, the two groups ac-
tually collesced in their demand for
true brotherhood.

The parallels between rioting in
Chicago’s South Side and rioting at
Michigan State or Berkeley point out
the weakness of the attempt to dis-
miss either as spring (or summer)
fever.

Instead they both indicateamean-
lngless experience for a large num-
ber of people in either environment.
They indicate a loss of identity with
the goals and methods of the society
whose rules they must obey.

And the riots indicate the desper-
ation of the individual in trying to
find a personal expression of his
situation.

Riots Handled Ditierontly

Unfortunately the main differ-
ences in the riots is the manner in
which they are handled. College ad-
ministrations only bringin the police
when absolutely necessary, and than
water hoses and threats of suspen-
sions are used'to quell the students.

in the slums, police armed with
clubs, tear gas, and dogs arrive on
the scene within minutes with armed
national gunrdsmen - on the way -
and the rioters are beaten into sub-
mission.

Thore is also a difference in the
aftermath of the riot. On Campus
the students are given new oppor-
tunities to express their complaints
to the faculty and administration.

Few Rocoivo Punishment!

Usually because of the large num-
ber of offenders, very few receive
punishments. In the slum the rioters
are eliminated from old from pov-
erty programs. They are given po-
lice records with the resultthatlhey
cannot get jobs. They are denied
channels to the local white estab-
lishment to correct slum conditions
and they are driven further into
desperation.

‘ by Douglas Rathgeb

Never have so many earnest fillmmakers tried so :

hard. yet failed in so many ways as those who have »
attempted to bring the life of. Christ to the screen.
Even if you exempt the filmmakers of the silent cinema,
the list of contemporaries who have attempted and :
failed is still a sizeable one. And “,5 people a", pm“ and un-

 
 
 
  
  
  

 

The reasons that their
films failed are the same
that have caused the decline
of Hollywood as the cinema
capital of the world--the
“star system," gross
commercialism, Super-
technirama 70 and the like.

And you can add to that the Amer-
ican fairy-tale attitude toward the
“Greatest Story,” one which re-
duces all the characters to hopeless
stereotypes and the dialogue to
cliches and moronic stock phrases.

Classic Examples oi Failure
The 1961 "King of Kings" and
1905 “Greatest Story Ever Told"
are classic examples of domestic
attempts which have dismally failed
to break the mold, fllrns which have
succumbed to every pitfall that their

glamorous. The Virgin Mary is any-
thing hut attractive, and Joseph has
the look of a coarse and ignorant
man.

Interpretation Unique

Pasollnl’s interpretation of the
man Christ is unique in concept.
Pasolint sees him as less the mild
philosopher and wise man, and more
the rebel, the angry young prophet
whose ardor sometimes verges on
fanatacism. ilis Christ is a moody,
alienated youth who scorns the
people for their contempt of him
and berates them for their wicked-
ness.

Pasolini’s failures, however, rest
not in his nterpretation, but with
his technique. liis direction quite
often is annoyingly amateurish. The
film lacks continuity, is poorly
edited and chlldlshly photographed.

Locks Directing Skills

genre is subject to.Artlsticallythey He seems to 130k the most b14510

of Kings” has the adrieddublous dls- drive, no strong movement, to the
tinclion of being a financial flop as film. It is merely a succession of
well. scenes from beginning to end.

 

 

It is of course a greal credit to
Pier Paolo Pasollni that his "The
Gospel According to St. Matthew”
does not stumble into any of the
Hollywood—created slnkholes.

But Mr. Pasolini has no need of
Hollywood’s boo boos-—bo creates
enough of his own.

I'Gospol" Best to Date

it must be stated before any harsh
judgments are made, however, that
“Gospel” is niost certainly the best
film to (into on the life of Christ.
If you have seen the rest of the lot,
you realize flint that is not saying
much. But the tenuous distinction,
for the moment, stands proudly.

Most significant of the film’s
achievements must be l’asollnl's
unique approach in the Christ story.

There are no glorious pnpcr-
mnclle temples in this film, no
gorgeous rrmidcns, no buxom bclly
dancer's. l’asulinl’s lietblehom and
Jerusalem are filthy, unglamurous
cities, filled with provety, stench,
ugliness and disease.

Pasolint’s camera is overactive
as well, moving when it need not,
photographing the inessential, the
superfluous.

Another major fault stems from
Pasollni’s choice of actors and his
method of working with them. The
cast is entirely non-professional--
Christ is played by young Spanish
college student, Joseph by a Roman
truck driver.

Mechanized Statues

As the characters appear on the
screen, they are more like mech-
anized statues than people, more
moullrpleccs used for the sole pur-
pose of exponmllug scripture and
philosophy. There is no life, no
depth to them.

And so the problem remains. As
slrwcro as the attempt was, and as
unique its interpretation, Pier Paolo
Pasulinl has failed like the rest,
leaving a challenge to those that
will iolluw and that maybe, some-
day, someone will accept and
triumph over.
