Last night our name... opened their 1966-7 cam- , 

patgn with an away contest with Central Connecticut
College. Although the results were notavailable at
publication time, usingour brand new crystal ball
(the soccer season saw the demise of our old one.) we
see the Danes in bad shape for this game, in particu-
lar. and far the entire season as well.

And it’s a real shame, a damn shame. Last year’s
squad rogistered what we called a “miracle season."
winning 13 games against 9 setbacks with a team of
veritable pygmies and ‘inexperienced players. This
year we looked forward to the addition of several key
sophs from last year’s fresh team to an experienced
and far stronger state squad with an outstanding sea-
son in the offing. Needless to say. we’re disappointed
at the turnabout of affairs.

This year’s team boasts the addition of only two
sophs from last year’s yearlings, only one transfer
student. who just became eligible. and that’s it. The
squad, at full strength. has only 9 members. and over
a 21 game schedule. that’s just not enough. Injuries
have beset the team already, and asitis with injuries,
they usually multiply as the season progresses. We
suggest that “Doc” Sauers wear playing shorts under
his suit pants.

The Dane hoopsters are without last year’s leading
scorer. Just recently they found out they would have
to do without the team’s best playmaker and clutch
shooter. Only two fresh chose to play varsityball this
season. The rationalization of this dilemma lsbasic--
in fact, it’s academic. Our athletes are simply find-
ing it too hard--or. tragically, too costly--to play
intercollegiate sports. We say sports because the
same is true in virtually everyother sporton campus.

What’s the solution? We certainly don’t lmow, but
if we did. we’d hold out for the highest bid from
coaches around the country. It’s an old story with a
new twist. Instead of having the good-looking football
player with a minus IQ, we’re finding men capable of
doing college work incapable of fitting sports into their
academic life. Or. even sadder, those who unsuccess-
fully try to.

We are fully certain college academic standards
are not going to slacken. We are equally sure sports
do have a place in college. So all we can really do is
lament the situation, probe for a solution, and keep
our fingers crossed. And one thing more.

We can even better appreciate those gifted few
athletes who have succeeded in incorporating a sport
with their academic studies. We can better realize
how much sacrifice and hard work these men exhibit
in doing this. We can laud even louder the efforts of
our modern day athlete-scholar. What else can we

opened its 1966-7 season
last night against Central
Connecticut in an away con-

test. '
The team is not in top physical
shape and will not be as strong as
when the early prospects were fore-
cast. Coach Sauers will have six
lettermen returning from last year’s
13-0 squad but will be minus two of
his top key players--high scoring
Mike Crocco who withdrew from
school, and Lonnie Morrison who
just recently left the team because
of academic reasons.

Top letterman returning is Mike
Bloom, a 6-0 senior guard from Al-
bany, who averaged 15.0 points a
game and is a key man in this sea-
son’s plans.

other returning starters are Jim
Constantino, a 5'11' guard from Mo-
honasen High in Schenectady and
6'1" forward Larry Marcus from
Kingston High. Constantino, a son-
ior, averaged nine points a game
last year, and is the only person
ever to captain the team for two
consecutive seasons. Junior Marcus

, averaged 11.8 points a game last
year and was the team’s leading
rebounder. As of the moment hehas
a bad leg and may only see limited
action in the Pratt game.

But the two leading prospects on
the team are not lettermen. They
are Scott Price, a 6'3" 200 pound
transfer from Butler who won ten
letters at Clifton Springs High, and
sophomore Rich Margison, asmooth
and graceful 6'!" forward from
Cortland High, who last year led
the fresh in scoring and rebounding.

Potter Playoff Triumph
11th In Last 12 Years

by Glenn Sapir

Potter Club ran away with the
AMlA league 1 football champion-
ship when it soundly defeated Alpha
Pi Alpha, 19-6, on Nov. 20. The
win for Potter clinched its eleventh
title in twelve years.

Both Potter and APA went into the
game with identical ’7-1 records,
their only losses coming at each
others hands. Potter's victory the
week before forced the extra game
to decide the champion.

The first big break of the game
went to Potter when Mike Shoinvold
recovered an APA fumble on the
opening kickoff. Potter took quick
advantage of the fumble recovery
when quarterback Jim Curley ran
around and for the touchdown gallop.
The point after attempt was unsuc-
cessful, thus Potter held a six point
lead. APA's first drive took them

all the way to the Potter three-inch
line where the tough EEP defense
dug in and prevented any further
advancement. The APA defense
proved just as tough as Potter was
forced to punt from deep in their
own territory.

With APA in possession of the
ball again, their second drive took
them all the way in for the score.
The touchdown came when allstar
quarterback Ray Cianfrtnl hit John
Hotaiing for APA's only score of
the game. The tie was short lived
as the EEPs sustained a fifty yard
scoring drive, climaxed by Curiey's
touchdown pass to Bob Savicki, to
give Potter a six point lead at the

Potter put the game on ice when
ailstar flankerback Ray McCioat
grabbed a fifty yard scoring bomb
and Al Babccck made good on the
extra point to clinch the win.

Fund iiiivo lo'iiaise
Money To Support
iSP Foster Child

For the fourth consecu-
tive year, the ASP is asking
University students tocon-
tribute to the support of its
Columbian foster child,
Graciala Garcia.

The drive will commence Mon-
day and will continue until Christ-
mas recess. Money willbe collected
on the dinner lines and in Humani-
ties 130 or in the newspaper office
in Van Ransselaer Hail.

Graciela Garcia has been the
foster child of the ASP since Janu-
ary 1964. The ASP is supporting
Giaciaia under the Foster Parents
Plan, an organization with inter-
actions] headquarters in New York

y.

The plan differs from the con-
ventional form of charity because
it is more direct and personal. Each
month the sponsor and the child ex-
change letters through Pian head-
quarters. Here the letters are trans-
lated, but both the original and the
translation are sent to the sponsor
and the child.

Craciala’s father is a carpenter
who earns $30 a month. This barely
meets the cost of the family's ne-
stligslties. The foster child receives
manhunt, d8u§8i8iuiiiildiﬂﬂtni
counseling, and guidance- Chm“
is 'sent at regular intervals.

Since adoption by “'9 A51"
Graciela has grown from an under-
nourished tc a healthy Child- The
contributions of the Foster Parents
Plan have not only improved the
living conditions of the family. but
have also enabled Gracialn to re-
ceive an education.

Here is Graciala's most recent
letter:

Dear Foster Parents:

This has the purpose of telling
you that two distinguished visitnnts
came to our country, Columbin.The
president of Venezuela and the pres-
ident of Chile came to follow closely
friendship relations between the
latin (sic) countries.

Also, we, my brother and i feel
better because of the' medical treat-
ment that we have been receiving
at the Plan. 1 received the donation
of US. $8.00, a pot and a large spun.
Thanks for all.

0n Residence Evaluation

by Greg Kicru

Last Thursday, the
Club met to discuss the adequacy,
validation, and use of the Residence
Hall Evaluation Form (printed at
left). At the end of the academic
year, each Resident Assistant is
required to fill out this form on
students in dorm residence.

The Resident Assistant then re-
views the evaluation form with the
Residence Director; checks placed
in either "above" or “below” are
questioned and after agreement has
been reached by both, the form is
placed in the student's permanent
residence file.

The forms are used primarily to
aid the University Placement Serv-
ice in writing recommendations to

Ceramicsion Formed
For Alcohol Policy

The first actions towards for-
mulating an Alcohol Policy on cam-
pus will be taken next Wednesday.
Mr. Neil Brown of Central Council
made this announcement as well as
naming the five faculty members of
the Alcohol Policy Board at Tues-
day’s meeting.

Dr. Theodore Standing, Dr. Thom-
son Liitlsfield, Miss Norma Edsall,
Mr. Joseph Silvey and Brown will
be on the board along with the five
students named a few weeks ago.
Brown hopes to meet twice a week
and eventually hold open meetings.

posal is currently in a special com-
mittee of Student Affairs Council

it, "it will go on to some other
mysterious body."

There was a lengthy discussion
in Central Council over the bussing

munity College for .home basketball

visory Board announced that there
would be ten buses going to HVCC

conceit tin Friday

The faculty of the Music Depart-

stated that when the placement of-

negative qualities of the students
are glossed over and the positive

in the majority of cases, the stu-
dent never sces the completed form,
and is denied access to the form
once it is filed.

The greatest volume of discus-
sion concerned the form’s validity,
and whether R.A.'s have enough
training in personality and psychol-
ogy to make a valid evaluation, and
whether they are qualified to deter-
mine a student’s emotional balance,
maturity, and sense of responsi-
bility.

with, and from this group will come
the five members of the team.

Gunn was pleased with the num-
ber of students volunteering, but
mentioned that members of Aca-
demic Affairs Commission have
been asking department heads for
recommendations of other students.

Within the next few days, Gunn
plans to visit the coaches of the
Russell Sage and RPl College Bowl
teams, to get some ideas for the
preparation of the team. He feels
that it is impossible to stuff a head
with knowledge, so the coaches will
concentrate instead on bringing the
knowledge out.

The studio to be used for drills
is now in preparation, and Gunn
hopes to have everything ready by
the middle of the month. This will
give him about four weeks in which
to prepare, including Christmas va-
cation and exam week. Gunn will
leave it up to the team whether or
not to practice over Christmas.

Gunn does not intend to use the
relative short preparation time as
a potential alibi, because he be-
lieves that there is a huge element
of luck involved with the type of
questions asked on a particular
night.

y Club Holds Discussion

Form

The discussion group agreed that
the present form is ambiguous and
inadequate. Five alternate sugges-
tions were proposed:

1. Abolish the form entirely.

2. linve any type of evaluation
optional to the student.

3- lluVo the RA. write an essay
on each student in place of' the
check sheet.

4. Have both R.A. and student fill
out duplicate forms independently
of one another. _

5. liavo the R.A. and the student
fill out the form jointly.
