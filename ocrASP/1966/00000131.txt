‘lleEviiIuaiion Necessary ‘

 At the Dec..1 meeting of the Psychology Club the-
validity of the Residence Hall Evaluation Form pre-
sently filled by each Resident Assistant on each stu—
" dent under his jurisdiction was questioned.

we feel that as the form now exists it is highly
subjective in its evaluation, that thevtopics under
which students are evaluated arehighly‘nebulous,
and that the form should therefore be re—evaluated.

For example, exactly how qualified is a Resident
Assistant to evaluate a student’s “Emotional Bal—
ance and Maturity?” Even more than this how qual-
ified are they to categorize the student’s balance
and maturity as “above” or “below” that of the
“average” student?

The form seems to contain obvious flaws in logic,
and we wonder exactly how a student’s “reaction to

 

 

criticism” is used we balance in deciding his
“independence.”
. It is hard to believe that an R.A. can obtain an

adequate picture of a student’s overall study habits.
especially in view of the fact that suite living is
much more isolatory than the old form of corridor

Thanks To ASP.

To‘the Editor:

As co-chairman of the Chinese
Auctions for Campus Chest this
year, I would like to express my
gratitude to the ASP for the fine
publicity they gave for our fund-
raising drive. Because the total re-
sults are not available as of this
date 1 cannot specifically say how
rewarding this coverage should be;
I can say the results that wehave
now show a marked improvement
over last year's. ' '

Unfortunately my gratitude toward
the press does not equal my disap-
pointment in the student body as
well as the faculty. Chinese Auctions
this year showed a total profit of
$635.00. This was considerably
higher than last year’s profit, but
for a university of this size It is
shameful. The items auctioned off

of Albany students, as well as fac-
ulty members, in mind. At most of
the auctions there was a poor rep-
resentation of the student body and
an even poorer representation of
the faculty. of the students who did
show up, only a few participated; of
the faculty virtually none partici-
pated.

Is this university spirit? Albany
State ls more than classes and books
and papers. it is a livingcommunlty

gether. If there is no spirit, there
is no university in the true sense
of the word.

A Modest Proposal
To the Editor:

As one views the State University
of New York at Albany as a whole,
one glaring contradiction is bound
to appear. This contradiction Is the
fact that Albany seems in all ways
to be a growing and increasingly
dynamic Universith with a great
future in all fields, all but' sports
that is.

One need only imagine the situa-
tion ten years from now when
“State” will have an enrollment of
well over 10,000. There will finally
be a football team, maybe, and it
will be about as successful asR.P.l.

has been in recent. ears. T c.500-

miliating defeats at the hands of
Quinnipiac. the basketball team will
still be taking on powers like Pratt
and Merrimack, and the baseball
team will still be losing.

And why will this deplorable situ-
ation exist? The answer is simple.
Colleges and universities under the

State University system do not give

athletic scholarships. Thus, al-
though tuition is low, few top athletes
with the requisite academic qualifi-
cations can be induced to attend a
school where they will have to pay
tuition and room and board, when
other institutions of similar caliber
are offering them four years free
education.

But why you may ask should the

living. With suite living the student, tucked away into
his self—sufficient suite, has a reduced exposure to
his R.A. who is also tucked away somewhere.

In our opinion, this reduced contam. does not lend
itself to particularly thorough evaluations of a stu-
dent’s ability to “lead others,” or in his “sense of
responsibility.”

Besides a re-evaluation of the form, preferably
with the opinion of a student committee, we feel two
other improvements could be made upon this system.

First, in view of the fact that the Evaluation Sheet
is a highly arbitrary evaluation made by one or two
individuals, each student should be able to view this
evaluation upon request, especially as this evaluation
is kept in the permanent residence file.

We feel this is an extremely poor system at best
and would like to see it abolished entirely.

Problems Can Be Solved

A problem solving service is being offered to stu—
dents through the newly formed Getting Through Col—
lege Clinic. This service could be beneficial with the

presence of .the_ correct attitude. of both those with
the problem and the problem solvers.

The present plan of the group necessitate the filling
out of a questionnaire to explain the problem. The
solution may then be presented in the form of a' per-
sonal contact or an impersonal reply. A group dis—
cussion of a specific problem may eventually result
when a prevalent nature is found among problems.

The organizers of the Clinic are still formulating
theories and we hope their plans remain flexible. Our
idea is that a problem solving clinic would be useful
if open meetings were held in which students could
air their problems.

A problem might not seem serious enough to war—
rant the filing of a questionnaire and just realizing

athletes and ignore others who have
similar contributions to make in
other fields? The question is indeed
a good one, and the best answer is
that athletes should not be given top
billing, but rather they should bein-
cluded in a program that provides
numerous “activities scholar-
ships.”

For what better way is there for
the State University system to es-
tablish and insure the highest stand-
ards in all fields than to offer
scholarships to those high school
seniors who, besides meeting aca-
demic requirementsof the school,
have also displayed outstanding tal-
ents in student government, com-
munications, music, art, athletics
or any of a number of other similar
fields.

The complications implied by such
a proposal are many, but withoutits
implementation, our sports will re-
main second rate, and although we

To me Editor:

Two dozen SUNYA students stood
in 28 degree weather Monday morn-
ing waiting for the University library
to open at 8:00 a.m.

Would it not be possible to allow
students in the heated area between
the outer and inner doors of the
library, during this cold period?

A guard maintained by the Uni-
versity is on duty at this time who
would be able to see that students
remained in the lobby until the li-
brary staff was ready to open.

November 28‘ and 29. The finalists
are Robert Fulmer, Gerald Gaes,
Susan Handler, Robert Katz, Gerald

As in the past, the Student Am-

solely on voluntary gifts for its fi-

able to expand the program so that
the University fully financed one am-

This year it is hoped that 2 ain—

program featuring three represene
Iatives from the United States De-
partment of State Monday, Nov. 28.
They were Arthur Olson,,Assistant
Secretary for EurOpean Affairs;
Macdonald Saulter,’ Public Admin-
istration Advisor to the Government
of South Vietnam; and James Boren,
Director of the Alliance for Pro-v
gress. Each man gave a short talk
and then answered questions from
the floor.

Olson presented an outline of the
present United States Foreign pol-
icy. ile said it was a result of the
country’s position at the end of
World War II; the United States was
the most powerful nation, with a
serious challenge from the Soviet
Union. '

 

U. 5. Containment Policy

Our foreign policy became one of
containment of Communism. Olson
also stated that Communist China
poses a serious threat, more so
than the Soviet Union.

Olson offered the opinion that the
world is experiencing a “revolu-
tion of rising expectation" from
the nations of Asia, Africa, and
Latin America. They want the mate-
rial successes that the United States
and Western Europe have obtained.

Boren gave an explanation ofwhat
the Alliance for Progress is doing.
Past programs, he said, trained
the people of Latin American in

and health, but did not develop the
countries’ own institutions to carry
on the work.

The Alliance, however, assists
the country in producing its own
institutions, while encouraging the
countries to collect its own taxes.
Boren also stated that there is a
private program in the Alliance,
one in which a state in the United
States becomes a partner with a
