SDS Presents Film Today
“On Child Development Plan

Students for a Democratic So-
ciety (SDS) will sponsor “A chance
for Change," today at 1:25 in Lec-
ture Room 3. This is a film on the
Child Development Group of Missis-
sippi, a program which began in the
summer of 1965 and has provided
pre-school training for over 12,000
children in121 centers.

CDGM has alsoenabled interested
poor people to obtain on-the-job
teacher training. The Office for
Economic Opportunity said this was
the most effective program in the
country for pre-school children, in
the state ranking lowest in educa-

nal status and op rtunity.

During its existence CDGM be-
came the second largest employer
in Mississippi and has involved the
underprivileged more than any other
project using Federal funds. Unfor-
tunately, funds were cut off October
15, 1966 because of political pres-
sure from within Mississippi.CDGM
is presently operatingwithout funds,
although many employees from the
communities have been forced to
return to their former menial jobs.

The film was chosen for presen-
tation by a Civil Rights convention
at Bennington College. Admission
is free; all are welcome.

It is a story of the Civil War
and the following Reconstruction
period, and contains scenes of
"spectacular" quality, as well as
dealing with intense human relation-

Considered as Griffith’s master-
piece, "The Birth of a Nation"con-
tains many then-revolutionary cine-
matic techniques which are cur-

such as cross-cutting, simultaneous
action, and the use of these tech-
niques to create tension and sus-

The treatment of the subject mat-

Faculty Adopts Statement

Conce ming Student A rrests

The faculty Senate, newly formed
last Spring, met Tuesday and voted
to adopt the following statement pre-
pared and submitted by Dr. Joseph
Norton of the School of Education,
concerning the arrest of seven Uni-
versity students on Election Day.

“On Election Day, seven Univer-
sity students along with 13 other
people were arrested by Albany
police while picketing in downtown
Albany.

“The pickets had been advised
by the Office of the State's Attor-
ney General that their action was
unquestionably legal provided ac-
cess to the polls was in no way ob-
structed (as it was not). ,

for explanation or justification of
the arrest and of this reprehensible
treatment of the citizens involved,
but none has been given.

"Therefore the faculty Senate of
the State University of New York at
Albany expresses its indignation at
the infringement of the civil liber-
ties of its students and others."

The Senate meets at least once
a month and is composed of twelve
faculty members atlarge, 30 elected
by the separate schools, 9appointed
by the President and four vice pres-
idents of the University and the Li-
brarian.

"The males in the group were Leukemia Drive

handcuffed, and were detained in

l Building Better Bridge I

by Richard Bet: and Marty Bergen

The double squeeze is one of the
most exciting plays in bridge. While
being extremely hard to set up, it
will almost always guarantee atop
score. In the following band, played
in the mixed pair eventat lastyear’s
Albany sectional, North opened with
one club. South's response should be
one diamond but derhaps he had little
faith in his puriner’splayofthe hand
so be bid one no-trump, hoping to
eventually play the hand himself.
South was surprised when he was
raised to three no-trump and even
more surprised when he saw the
dummy.

After the opening lead of spade
six, South played the ten of spades
from dummy which held the trick,
and returned a club which was won
by East's king. East returned a
diamond to dummy's stiff ac . De-
clarer led another club, \;n by
East’s ace and again played :1 dia-
mond. South, playing for down one
disdained the finesse and put up
the diamond king which dropped the
'queon. Declnror pitched a heart from
dummy. He now led the spade five
and West played the ace. This play
set up the double squeeze. West ex-
ited with a club and doclnror cashed
his two club tricks endinginhis hand
with the jack. 0n the club tricks,
West pitched a spade and East two
diamonds.

South now led thejuck oidluinonds
and West was squeezed. its either
had to ungunrti his heart stopper or
his spade stopper. lie finally pitched
a hoart us did declnror from dum-
my. East followed suit with a diu-
mond.

Declarer led a heart to dummy’s

cashed the king of spades and East
was squeezed. If he pitched a dia-
mond, South would play a heart to
his ace and his low diamond would
provide the tenth trick. IfEastthrew
away a heart, South's ace and three
of hearts would be good. West can
break up the double squeeze by hold-
ing up on the ace of spades when
South leads a spade to dummy, but
it is not an easy play to make.Need-
less to say, South's fine play gained
a top score.

Initial try-outs for the General
Electric College Bowl team were
held last Tuesday and Wednesday
night in the Humanities building.
Those students who appeared were
asked seventy questions that were
once used on College Bowl, and
given only three or four seconds to
answer most of them. "

The team's head coach, Mr. John
M. Gunn, was disappointed in the
turnout of only nineteen students for
the two try-outs, and will have to
continue looking for more possi-
bilities while working withhthose he
has already.

After he analyzed the results of
the Tuesday night tests, Mr. Gunn
discovered that he needs a student
well versed in literature and one
in science.

Four Specialists
When he composes the final team,
Gunn hopes to have one specialist
in .each of four areas, and each
person will hopefully be knowledge-
able in one or two other areas.

Gunn still does no have all four
of his line coaches, but is not at all

college '* ll!

perturbed. After viewing  results

 

of the tryouts, he has  his

concepts of what he needs aadkwants'
in a line coach. . 1

Early next week, the first group
of students selected will face each
other in a similated contest to be
held in a mock-studio. Gunn will
juggle the teams until he findi the
best combination. Those students
selected in the second group will
be integrated as soon as they are
Selected.

Scrimmages

Gunn is looking for "acrim-
mages” with other teams as well.
He hopes to scrimmage a team
from the Milne School which ap-
peared on "The Little Red School-
house," which is the high school
equivalent of College Bowl. The
contest with Milne will center on
current events and will beprlmerily
a test of reﬂexes. I

in addition, the team will probably
face a faculty team, and perhaps a
team from Smith College, which is
due to make an appearance on the
College Bowl soon.
