Radio Station Programing Purposes
Include Entertainment, Education

The purpose of WSUA program-
ming is two-fold, accordingtoliich-
ard Stevens, program director of
the university radio station. The
first purpose is, to entertain the
listener and the second is to serve
as part of his education here at the
University.

Although entertainment can be
drawn from any of the sundy shows.
only a few are designed solely for
entertainment. "The Top 40 Rock
Shows" and the} "Prankiine" are
examples of the pure entertainment
program.

‘ Educational Show

One of the most educational shows
is Lou Strong's “Jazz Anthology.”
The idea for this show was con-
ceived by Lou Strong, who isanoted
jazz musician about this campus.
“Jazz Anthology” is considered no
good that it is sent all over the coun-
try by the intercollegiate radio sys-
tem. This Sunday evening show has
been programed to appeal to the
general audience as well as theiazz
lover.

Education by music has also been
programed onto the WSUA network
through several other shows. These
shows include “Big Bands,"
"Broadway Music," "Folk" and
many others.

Stevens also pointed out the edu-
cational value of the extra long
Saturday talk sho Ir, “Comment,”
during which views on student prob-
lems are aired by leading person-
alities oi the University Community.

The programming of WSUA also
includes newscasts of the local, na-
tional and international levels for
the students' beneiit.The University
station has also taken the action to
announce activity meetings, the ar-

rival of busses for students on
Alumni Quad and the list of cancel-
led classes.

Main Concern _

The main concern of the WSUA
staff is presenting a series of pro-
grams during the day that will be
listened to by the student. To in-
sure that this principle ls being
carried out the program depart-
ment of WSUA will conduct a stu-
dent opinion survey.

The survey will begin tomorrow
and will continue for several weeks.
About half a dozen people from
WSUA will go from door to door in
the dorms on Alumni Quad asking
opinions 0n the radio station.

The survey will include such on . .—
tions as: Who is your favorite DJ?
What is your favorite program?
How good is the reception? Which
type of music is your favorite?
How is WSUA as compared to the
area stations? Do you have any
complaints or ideas for the im-
provement of the radio station?

Survey?

From this survey Stevens and his
colleagues hope to shape the WSUA
program for next semester. They
have already thought of some ideas
that may be tried during the spring
semester. One of the most impor-
tant ideas is the beginning oi the
WSUA day at '7 a.m. with a morn-
ing rock show. This is two hours
enriior than the radio station goes
on the air now.

The programming department of
WSUA has also been thinking of
having two DJs for one show so
dialogue can be added to some of
the musical programs. At the Na-

tlonal intercollegiate Broadcasters
conference held recently it was
brought out that college students buy
more albums than any other group.
With this fact in mind WSUA will
be trying to procure more albums
for use on their programs.

Stevens announced that two things
that were done last year will be
done this winter also. With the aid
of Dr. Sauers the team strategy will
be broadcasted during the basket-
ball games. Also to be used again
this year ‘will be solid sound, a
continuous flow of music to study
by during exam week.

WSUA Has Grown From An Idea
To A Successful Radio Station

.by Robert Bradbury

in 1949 Radio Council became the
first group at State to try to pro-
mote lnterest in a college radio sta-
tion. The administration in control
at that time, however, appears to
have been against such a new idea
as a student operated radio station
supervised by college officials. As
a result the council achieved only a
few slow gains.

In the 50’s there was a resur-
gence of interest and in 1952 and
53 the radio station was approved by
various offices. The radio station
didn't go beyond the idea stage and
so interest died out.

In 1962 the College Radio Station
Committee under Bill Alexander
'64 succeeded in gaining support for
the radio station until in March of
that year the Senate approved $2.000.

First Manager

Finally on February 22, I963
WSUA went on the air under' its
first manager Bill Alexander from
its cramped studio near the dining
room and of Brubacber. In the late
fall of that year WSUA contracted
with UPI for news service.

Under the next two managers,
D'on Allen and Nick Argyros (May
1063 to April 1964), WSUA con-
tinued in its original studio. How-
ever, in April 1904 WSUA moved
to its much bigger and improved
present studio off from the Bru-
bacher game room.

Duane White, the manager from

Inna. i

April, 1964 to November, 1964, and
Ron Campisi decided to mark the
move by increasing the amount of
rock and roll played by the station
and by playing it later at night.
Increased Efficiency

Gary Luczak, the manager until
April, 1965 increased administra-
tive efficiency and rewrote the ra-
dio’s constitution to its present
form. In January of 1965 WSUA
became affiliated with ABC, and so
began using ABC materials and
straws.

Last year under David Hughes,
the manager until November, and
TM Parks, the manager until June,
1965 WSUA tightened up its organ-
ization, set up an official policy,
and experimenti-d with advertising.

Under the present director, Jim
Grinnell, WSUA has gone all out
for advertising. Tad Parks, the
technical director, says that WSUA
still isn’t certain where it willeven-
tually broadcast from the new cam-

pus.

Originally, it was planned that
WSUA set up a studio in a small
area in the Academic Podium, but
this area is smaller than the pre-
sent studios. The Student Center

was ruled out because of the diffi-
culty of sound-proofing presented
by the curved ceilings.

 

According to Tad Parks, tread of
WSUA's engineeringdepartment, the
station's equipment is set up so as
to provide flexibility and backup in
producing and broadcasting the sig-
nals. In the event of a failure in the
first control room, the technicians
on duty can switch to the second
control room in 10 seconds.

WSUA has three control rooms.
Control room A is generally used
for rock and roll; control room B
for “easy listening” music and for
interviews and discussions; and C
for pretaped programs and “re—
motes” or in other words, pro-
grams originating outside of the
station.

Remote Board .

The complete remote board in
control room C cost about $600
and greatly simplifies the tech-
nicians’ work. Also, there are two
large tape decks in control room C.

The only major way that WSUA
differs from regular commercial
stations is that WSUA feeds the
signals into the electrical systems
of the dorms using them as antennae,l
instead of using an aerial tower as
an antenna. The signal is carried
to the dorms on the old campus by
underground cables and to the new
campus on telephone' lines (radio

loops).

One disadvantage of WSUA's sys-
tem is that whenever electrical apc"
pliances are turned on and entire
transmitter no longer matches the
electrical system. Also, any changes
in the wiring of the dorms also up.-
sets the system. Stuyvesant Tower
presents a special problem; when-
ever any of its elevators are used
they upset the matching of the two
systems.

Engineering

The engineering department un-
der Parks is building one large ,
transmitter for the Colonial Quad.
Parks believes that it will soon be
done and Colonial will be able to
receive WSUA. One of the reasons
for the delay is that there exists
a copper shortage and it is diffi-
cult to obtain the wire they need.

Parks says that the reasons WSUA
is going on to Colonial Quad and the
building another big transmitter at
Dutch.

The reason WSUA is building it
instead of purchasing is that all
commercial transmitters that would
work are far too expensive. The
head engineer also feels that they
will get better transmitters by build-
ing them themselves, unlike the
Dutch Quad’s which were purchased.
