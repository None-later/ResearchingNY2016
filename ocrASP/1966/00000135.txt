'The Parable’

To the Editor:

“The Parable," a unique avant-
garde film, will be presented on
Sunday, Dec. 11, 2:30 p.m. in ice-
ture room 3. It wiu be followed by
an experimental format, including
discussion and refreshments.

Acclaimed as the finest motion
picture at the 1964 World’s, Fair,
this modern parable has a definite
impact--dlsturbing to some, inspir-
ing to others.

A pilot project for a new pre-
sentation and discussion series on
the relevance of Christianity today,
the showing is the result of the
meeting of an until now anonymous
group of students.

As a “life unexarnined is not
worth living,” we believe that Chris-
tianity unexamined is not worth
keeping!

We wonder if there is not a need
for a forum to concentrate on the
meaning and relevance (if any?)
of Christianity in the' twentieth cen-
tury and in university life?

Whether this forum continues next

semester depends on the turnout and
reaction of students and facility on
Sunday. What topics presented and
discussedalso depend on your sug-
gestions.

All students and faculty are wei-
comei Come on in (to the center
of the campus, lecture room Sunder
the library) and join us in this ex-
periment on Sunday at 2:30 p.m.li

Poor Attendance

To the Editor:

It was with much chagrin that I
attended last Monday's recital by
the renowned pianist, Charles Ro-~
sen. Page Hall was less than half
full. This condition is not only em-
barassing to the guest artist, it is
a shameful reflection onState’s stu-
dent body. Only one half of this
meager audience were State stu-
dents.

It is puzzling to try to account for
this mass non-turnout. Other pian-

in look it The Pumpkin People |

by Sherman Richards

Pumpkins are a special type of
people. They are special because
they’re always happy. They lie out
in the fields all day basking in the
sun. it is obvious that they are a
healthy breed from their vivid color-
ing.
Pat and Peter (Pumpkin) were in
love with each other. They did vir-
tually everything together. Their po-
sition on the field gave them aiovely
View of the road which passed by the
field and led to the big city.

Pat and Peter were young, but
they had spent a great deal of time
together. They had many happy days
together; than, one day it happened.

The Idea

it was early morning. Pat was
already awake; Peter was still
asleep. Pat was watchingafast mov-
ing wagon pass her on the road.
For the first time in Pat’s life, a
new thought entered her mind. In a
matter of minutes, her thoughts fo-
cused and she realized her desire
of hopping on a passing wagon which
take her to the big city.

In her entire life, she had never
gone past the limits of the pumpkin
field. Now she felt determined to
see the big City. She knew that if
she told Peter of her new desire that
he would never understand because

- his thoughts were as limited as hers

once were.

She wrote him a note explaining
where she was going and that she'd
be all right. it was only a short wait

before she found a boy who was'

willing to give her a ride on his
wagon. All the while Peter slept.

When Peter awoke, he couldn't
understand where Pat had gone. Af-
ter reading her note, he still couldn't
understand. He felt, though, that he
had to follow her. He knew that she
ﬂuid bo helpless in the big city.

By the time Peter reached the
city, it was late afternoon (It had
been harder for him to get a ride).
He searched and searched for his,
love, Pat. After a very short time,
he felt completely lost. To him the
:ity was complex and extremely un-
familiar. The clty was strange and
he felt like a stranger.

With the coming of night, he was
completely in the dark. He was near
the outskirts on the other side of
the city when he thought he saw a
familiar form. As he walked to-
wards the object, a light from the
sky allowed him to see his love who
was only a short distance away.

As they ran towards each other
he passed a number of mice. Put
had her arms outstretched towards
Peter and was just about to reach
him, when suddenly Peter was turned
into a royal coach. No amount of
pleading by Pat could get the coach
to turn back into her love, Peter.

While Pat was still in her frenzy,
the coach, now pulled by four white
stallions, started moving. One wheel
narrowly missed going through Pat.
Tears streamed from her eyes as
she watched the coach vanish over
the horizon.

Pat waited for what seemed to
her to be an endless time, but the
coach never returned. Her heart
sunken, her mind flossed over with
disbelief and pain, she started back
to her pumpkin field.

The next day Pat and Peter (Pump-
kin) were together ngain. (Peterhad
returned that morning after a limited
engagement as a coach in some fairy
tale.) Absence had truly made their
hearts grow louder. They still oc-
cupied the same spot in the field,
but this time, by common agree—
ment, they turned their backs to
the road leading to the big city.

Moral
The moral of this story is leave
the big city to us watermelons.

The pathetic student audience is
easily dismissed as a lack of pub-
licity which could be attributed to a
lack of communication between or
within the sponsoring agent (Music
Council) and the publicizing agents
(especially the ASP). But in fact,
who are these agents? Students, just
as we all are. Thus the ultimate re-
sponsibility must rest with each and
every member of an apparently
apathetic student body.

If our University is to continue to
experience dynamic growth and ex-
pansion, every student must accept
the challenge and contribute to, par-
ticipate in, and hence, partake of
this growth. Only when the individ-
ual upholds both his academic and
cultural responsibilities to himself
will our University fulfill its prom-
ise. Just because our population is
expanding, we, the students, must
not become an amorphous mass of
non-entitites.

An Apology

To the Editor:

We would like to apologize for
the inconvenience to the riders who
returned via the Hempstead Bus
Charter after Thanksgiving Vaca-
tion.

After speaking to the bus com-
pany representatives, we were in-
formed that the delay and substi-
tute equipment were due to traffic
conditions and administrative mis-
understandings between the Albany
and New York offices. The situation
has since been rectified and assur-
ance has been given that the said
problem will not recur 1n the future.

Both of us are confident that fu-
ture operations will be as smooth
as they have been in the past years.
We sincerely hope that we may be
of service to you again.

Sunday night in Lecture Room 3 of the Library, Psi ’ "

Gamma .will present the first of its "Insigit" pro-

‘ grams- Those who attend this lecture will hopefully
be given an "Insight into Birth Control.” From ad-
vance noticies, it is quite obvious a good deal of
planning has gone into this event.

By having on hand a past national secretary of
Planned Parenthood Association. representatives of
various faiths. the University Infirmary. and the
Counseling Service, we are assured of having a
lively, informative program with several sides of
the issue to insure comprehensive treatment.

We feel birth control is a subject in which every-
one has an obligation to become education. In a so-
ciety to which all of us are increasingly exposed, it
is now more necessary that we learn something of

planned parenthood.

A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, and
it is unfortunate that most of us have obtained our
little knowledge from unreliable sources. We are
fortunate to have the opportunity to absorb some
of the philosophy of family planning and methods of

birth control.

Of course, once we have availed ourselves of the
opportunity to obtain this information, it is up to
individuals to use it as they see fit.

‘Wrung Box’ Scores Hit

With Mild, Captivating Satire

by Douglas
I do not believe I know

of another director at the

present time who has made so many different types
of films and managed to succeed so well with each of
them as Englishman Bryan Forbes.

Forbes is a brand-new

face in directing. He has

highest praise.

His firstpicture. “Whis-
tle Down The Wind,” with
Hayley Mills, was a charm-
ing and sensitive story
about the unwavering faith
of children.

._ .3 Concert Review

Virtuoso Receives
Mixed Comments
On Performance

by Linda King

Charles, Rosen’s virtuosity and
excellence in the six selections
played won him a great deal of
applause in his concert perfor-
mance in Page Hall Monday evening.

The “Sonata in D," the first
piece, expertly expressed the beauty
and tenderness of Mozart’s melod-
ies. The second movement,
“Adagio,” best of the three, dis-
played the pianist’s outstanding ex-
pressive delicacy.

The other two movements, al-
though light and quick, were treated
too romantically for a classical
composer such as Mozart by over-
peddling, and at times the piece
lacked clarity of rhythm and tone.

Broke With Tradition

"Sonata" by Beethoven not only
broke the traditional form of the
sonata, but also displayed the calmer
more tender parts of Beethoven
which few people associate with
him. Again Rosen concentrated on
the slower, romantic elements of
the music, in the performance of
which he excelled. Though the other
sections were played deliberately,
one could not find the dramatic ef-
fects which Beethoven intended.

Mr. Rosen seemed undisturbed by
the difficulties of Elliot Carter's
"Sonata," a contemporary piece.
The changing meters and odd rise
of harmonies are characteristic of
the composer. Often keys an octave
higher than the ones played are held
down and thus they are forced to vi-
brate with the tones that are struck.

Exceptional Command

Rosen was at ease with the veiled,
impressionistic “Preludes' of De-
bussy. He had such exceptional com-
mand of the flowing passage, that the
notes melted into each other. The
third prelude contrasted with the
turbulence, excitement and anger.

Mr. Rosen performed two on-
cores; the standard “Nocturn in
Flt” by Chopin and "Fantasy on
Themes by Johann Strauss" by Bo-
senthnl, which delighted the aud-
ience with its light, humorous air.

tinct in style and approach, and each deserving of

"Seance on a Wet Afternoon,"
with Kim Stanley and Richard Atten-
borough, came next, and eerie psy-
chological study concerning a kid-
napping. Then in 1965 came “King
Rat,” an incisive study of brutality
and animalism among the POW’s of
a Japanese prison camp in World
War II.

Changes Paco Again
Forbes has again changed pace
completely with his fourth and latest
attraction, and he has once again
succeeded in fine style.

His “The Wrong Box" isacharm-
ing periodpiece, awhimslcal, mildly
satiric exercise in Victorian tom-
foolery that never ceases to amuse
and captivate.

Here is a film blessed with the
very best of everythingna mar-
velously enthusiastic cast, superb
photography, imaginative direction,
and a witty, intelligent script that
would have brought a smile to the
lips of an Oscar Wilde.

Trust Fund

The film’s antics revolve around
a trust fund set up for a group of
children in the early 1800's in Eng-
land. The fund would be allowed to
mature as the children grew to man-
hood, then awarded to thelast sur-
viving member of the group.

As the film opens, only two of the
original group remain, the last ones
in contention for the prize of over
one hundred thousand pounds.

They are two old geezers, broth-
ers as well, played broadly and
with great skill by John Mills and
Sir Ralph Richardson. And it just
so happens that these two oldsters
have kin who are, to say the least,
interested in the final outcome of
this lifelong contest.

Hairs are Rivals

Richardson's two nephews, broad-
ly played by Peter Cook and Dudley
Moore, indulge in some degree of
chicanery to see that the money
comes their way, while Mills' son,
played by Michael Caine, pursues
the affection of Richardson's niece,
beautiful Nanette Newman.

It would be criminal to give away
what goes on from this point. it is
sufficient enough to say that Forbes
keeps this merry-go-round spinning
at a delicious pace, poking fun at
everything from “Victorian Sexual
Response" to the Salvation Army.

How nice it is to see a film that
is truly worth the high price of ad-
mission.

audiences all this week and next in the Richardson Hall Studio Theatre. Direc‘bd

There is a pervasive
quality about it; it follows
the spectator out of the
theatre, goes home with
him and refuses tobe gone.
Words and phrases hang
on, reminders of the frus-
tration the play itself im-

Maior Effort

The experience of sitting through
l‘The Memorandum" is in itself
enough to try the patience of Job;
not because it is overly long (which
it is), not because it is poorly
played (which it is not), but simply
because it involves a major effort
not getting on stage with these un-
believable people and shaking them,
screaming at them, slapping them.

'If, however, the characters de-
serve a shake, the actors assuredly
deserve a hearty handshake. The
strength of the reaction they elicited
is a testimonial to their skill.

It is hard to decide whether top
honors should go to Mort Hess as
Ayler or to the trio of Lange,Terry
and Prete as Stutz, Crump and
Helen. Absent from SU'I‘ stages for
several years, Mr. Hess has once
again come to the fore ,as an ex-
tremely skilled actor. As for the
aforementioned trio, it is debatable
whether they can be separated, since

The only disappointment of the
evening was Chuck Bartlett as
Gross. Notwithstanding his horren-
dous makeup, his style often better

performance was satisfactory.

“The Memorandum" undeniably
provides an exercise in technical
excellence; the question remains,
Is the script really worth it?

This might seem to come by way
of praise of the script; such is not
the case, for although the cast
fought valiantly for the most part,
it was a losing battle. “The Mem-

doubles back on itself and reduces
its own sum to zero in a way that

‘Royal Gambit’s Mixed Review
Typifies Players’ Performance

by Diane Somerville
Program notes are notoriously misleading, and
those provided by the Galaxy Players to accompany
their recent production of Hermann Gressieker’s
“Royal Gambit” was a classic example. The play
enjoyed a two-night run December 2 and 3 in Page

Hall.

The Galaxy company, a
repertory troupe now resi-
dent in Schenectady. estab-
lished a mixed reputation
for itself: what is good is
very good; but what is bad
is bad indeed. “Royal Gam—
bit” followed the pattern
faithfully.

Ostensibly the play deals with the
life of Henry the Eighth of England
and his wives. The piece ofdoggerel
immediately comes to mind:

King Henry the Eighth,

Six wives he wedded:

Two died, the two divorced,
One survived,

One beheaded.

Play Not Dialogue

It is, however, more than that;
the program refers to it as a “San-
tyanan dialogue between the Flesh
and the Spirit," which shows how
much most program-noters know.
The play cannot truly be called a
dialogue at all, since we never really
hear anyone else's sidebut Henry's.

It cannot be denied, however, that
his side is well and adequately rep-
resented. William Granneil, who
portrayed the monarch from youth
through age, must be highly com-
mended for his role.

Henry Well Played

Every aspect of the man - his
voracious sexual appetites, his in-
corrigible selfishness, his wlliness,
his shameless flattery and double-
dealing - had an undeniable auth-
enticity. it was impossible, if not to
love the man, at least to remain
indifferent to him.

Some of his six wives were his
match; some were not. Highest
praise must go to Pamela Morrell,
who played Katerina of Aragon, the
first and lawful wife, whose dignity
and sincerity were always evident.

She was matched by the low-pitched
sensuality and control of Dorice
Nelson (Anne Boleyn); and it is cer-
tainly a great pity that Marion Mc-
Kendree was not seen more fre-
quently as Kate Parr.

Audiences Small

Audiences were disappointingly
small for both performances, and
often bored (one man audibly so in
his slumber) at the excessive length
of the show.

Technical aspects of the play
bordered on unacceptable. Not only
was the staging unimaginative, the
makeup unsubtle (Anna of Cieves'
appearance matched her perfor-
mance) but props absent, but the
crew was also poorly organized.
It is a pity that some aspects of the
Galaxy Players cannot come up to
others.

' by Jarka Burian, the Vaclav Havel play is as depressing a piece of dramaturgyas
theSUT boards have seen in a longwhile; yet in some measure - but not completely ~
- it does succeed: perhaps because, perhaps in spite of. this ve

rlysu liness.
not even the most a ur tradition-
- where its author places it -.could
condone.

The pretense at the absurd might
have been carried off were it not for
the painfully obvious final speeches
Gross must deliver. His own state-
ment that he is in an absurd condi-
tion goes far toward negating all
that has gone before.

Theme

The theme of the play is sup-
posedly anti-bureaucracy, and per-
haps this accounts for thedisagree-
able atmosphere it creates. If’
Havel's intention was to strike a
blow against the bureaucrat by pre-
senting him as a thoroughly hateful
person, then he has certainly suc-
ceeded.

Music Review
Pianist Displays
Musical Sensitivity
it lioniiay concert

Those who attended Monday's Mu-
sic Council event were treated to a
rare and expanding musical exper-
ience. Charles Rosen, concertpian-
ist and recording artist for Columbia
and Epic, presented his audience
with a varied program which dis-
played his musical sensitivity and
dazzling virtuosity. '

The concert opened with aMozart
sonata. Mr. Rosen gave the melodies
of this werk the lucidity they de-
serve, but the middle Adagio move-
ment seemed more brittle than it
need have been. Next came'one of
the Beethoven sonatas (no. 30), in
which the concluding set of varia-
tions was most interesting.

For many, the highlight of the
program was the Elliott Carter
work. A wildly powerful piece, set
in the modernidiom and wrought with
polytonal dissonances, this sonata
conclusively demonstrated Mr. Ro-
sen’s incredible virtuosity. For this
listener, the intricacies of the work
were next to unfathomable, sub-
merged within a complete pyrotech-
nical display.

At the opposite extreme of ex-
pression were three preludes of
Debussy, executed with sublime sen-
sitivity. The etherial idiom of Im-
pressionism, with its use of modes
and chromaticism, transformed the
piano into a seemingly different in-
strument than that employed in the
Carter work. (Debussy’s Etudesare
recorded on Epic by Mr. Rosen.)

As encores, Mr. Rosen played a
Fantasy on themes ofJohannStrauss
as arranged by Rosenthal -- ade-

lightful potpourri of familiar
melodies, not so familiarly
treated -- and Chopin’s popular

Nocturne in Fit Major.

All in all, it was an enriching
evening; a pity more persons were
not there to enjoy it.
