 admse over the

as year a co

scheduling of concert events for the
weekend of April 7. 1967. The conflict
was between the scheduling of Page Hall
for a concert to be held in conjunction
with the Sophomore Weekend, and the
newly formed Council for Contemporary
Music. who had wanted to schedule a big
name concert at the Washington Avenue
Armory on the same weekend.

As Student Affairs prohibits the sched-
uling of two such concerts on the same
weekend, it was decided that the Con-
temporary Music Council would sponsor
a Righteous Brothers Concert in con—
junction with the sophomore class.

However, it appears that the Wash-
ington Avenue Armory will not be avail-
able for concerts at that time. Conse-
quently it was agreed upon that the
Council should look into the possibili-
ties of sponsoring such a concert at the
RPI Field House.

At present the Council has not taken
any definite steps in this direction, but
has decided to present a Clancey Broth-
ers concert in Page instead. Therefore
unless the sophomores want to co-spon-
sor this concert, or schedule one of their
own, they have to relinquish Page Hall
to Music Council.

The Council justified this move on the
grounds that to sponsor a concert pre-
sented at the Field House wuld notqual—
ify it as a University event.

The idea that a concert not held on the
University grounds is not a University
event is ludicrous, especially in view of
the fact that we do not have the space
necessary to support a concert of this

wouldn’t be able to afford (Le. con-

ilur Position

In two separate statements the faculty
of this University has expressed their
indignation at the “infringement of the
civil liberties” of the students who were
arrested for picketing near an Albany
polling place on Election Day.

We feel thagthe legal technicality of
this matter is not the most important
issue. These students were upholding
their moral obligation to protest what
they felt was not right.

We not only commend them for this
action, but also the faculty for their
definite position.

double Standard

In a statement released on Decmeber
7, 1966, Mayor Corning noted the con—
cern of Acting Police Court Judge Segal
with the futures of the students who were
among the arrested pickets. Judge Segal,
Mr. Corning says, investigated “the
possibility of dropping the charges be—
cause many of the individuals couldhave
been misinformed.”

The concern was for the possible
jeopardy of job opportunity for the in-
volved. One is left to wonder what would
have happened if only members of The
Brothers had been arrested. Would the
same convictions that might have af-
fected their futures also. have roused
the same concern within Judge Segal?
Does Section 772-a of the Penal Law
read differently for local members of
a Negro organization and for white
middle-class students at a large state-
owned university?

We think not.

When elections are finally held,

I don't know whether to plead for
student interest and reform, merely
ask for "someone" to explain to

l COMMUNICATIONS l

Med. Office Praised ’

To the Editor:

1 would like to update an old im-
age that may still linger in the
minds of the upperclassmen at
"State." I can recall that last year
as a transfer student, when I asked
where the Medical Office was,
everyone here just laughed and said
forget it.

I went down to them in Draper
Hall just once. It was as hilarious
as a Bob Hope Special. Well, the
administration has started some-
thing worthwhile this year. The new
Health Center is an amazing im-
provement over the Medical Office
in both equipment and personnel.

As a patient for 5 days, I re-
ceived as good medical attention as
if I were in a hospital. They have a
total of 8 doctors and a full-time
staff‘of the. greatest professional
nurses and nurse's aides.

They are having some difficul-
ties, bui they will be straightened
out with time. The purpose of the
Health Center was to establish hos-
pital facilities for Albany State stu-
dents so that the burden of the city
hospitals could be tightened.

Don’t be foolish, students, if you
are sick, go to the Health Center;
the old image is dead and buried.
Remember paying that insurance
premium on your term bill - you
can get your money’s worth from
the Health Center.

Again, I would like to extend my
thanks to the people at the Health
Center for the treatment I re-
ceived.

Clinic Explained

To the Editor:
We would like to thank the ASP
for the intelligent coverage and

contribution to GETTING THROUGH
COLLEGE CLINIC's establishment.
Unfortunately, a question has arisen
concerning the relationship of one
dollar to the CLINIC's services.

We, and particularly Professor
Apostle, are concerned with lndecies
of social problems in the area of
collegiate survival. This has led to
developing an experimental model,
the CLINIC, to find out ifpeople will
come to such a clinic, to determine
the type of problems which exist,
and to consider how they may be
remedied.

A survey of professors and stu-
dents on campuses of the Tri-Cities
area indicated a need for just such
an entity which has little if any as-
sociation with college administra-
tions. Therefore, the CLINIC exists
outside the domain of universities
and hopes to become, perhaps, the
"Ann Landers" of student problems.

It is felt that a small charge of
one dollar to cover some of the
operating costs would serve to bene-
fit the clients and the CLINIC. By
paing this small amount and having
a vested interest in the clinic, stu-
dents are likely to give more oftheir
cooperation to ensure the success
of that interest. Needless to say,
this ensures the success of the en-
tire CLINIC.

Further clarification may be ob-
tained by speaking with the CO
Directors and/or Professor ApostleT

Alpha Lambda Chi Joins
Frats A3 Active Colony

Albany State's newest fraternity,
Alpha Lambda Chi, celebrated one
month of existence last week. The
fraternity was formed on Nov. 9,
1966, and received colony status
from l.F.C. soon after. Presently
there are twenty-one members,
most of them sophomores.

In the past month, ALC has se-
lected its officers, written a con-
stitution, and given service to the
university. The officers are presi-
dent, Gregory Ellstrom; vice-pres-
ident, Lawrence Kaye; secretary,
Gerald Calvario; treasurer, Michael
Rosenbers.

Lewis Saperstein and Arthur
Cronson are the I.F.C. representa-

tives for the fraternity. Last Satur-
day members of ALC were up at
the Mohawk Property sawing fire-
wood and gathering stones for a
proposed fireplace.

This Saturday night ALC will join
with the other Jraternitles at the
basketball game and collect money
for the Leukemia hind.

ALC has entered two basketball
teams in the AMIA leagues, and one
bowling team.

The fraternity has selected the
colors of black and gold, is currently
planning to take in a pledge class
next semester and is attempting to
get a section in a dormitory.

Alcohol on campus is a point of
discussion in many universities and
colleges across the country. More
and more centers of‘learning are
ending their long stand on prohibiu
tion.

' 9n the arrival of the news that
Albany was going to allow alcohol
on campus the SUC at Oswego pushed
harder to reach their goal of legal-
ization of alcohol. Since Albany has

joined the ranks of the “wet” uni-
versities and colleges, Oswego
seems to be asking, why can’t we?

The Oswego Senate gave a vote
of confidence (7-2) to the President
of their Student Association, Thom-
as Fencil, in regards to his actions
to liberalize their existing alcohol
codes.

Senator Dennis Doell gave as a
reason for approval his feeling that
if drinking was allowed off campus,
it seems reasonable that it should be
allowed on campus. Miss Audrey

Bradford, also on the senate, ap-
proved this measure because in her
opinion the student ateswego should
be adult enough to have this re-
sponslbllity.

These reasons should sound is-
miliar to the Albany University stu-
dent. Basically the same reasons
were expressed on this campus in
previous years. These ideas are not
unique to Albany and Oswego, but
are common to any “dry” campus
that has the desire to drink.

They reasoned that a University
should not become a foster parent,
but recognize the maturity and re-
sponsibility of the students.

Bucknell University of Lewis-
burg, Pennsylvania is a campus
without alcohol. A recent editorial
in "The Bucknellian" put forth,
again, some familiar arguments.
The Bucknellians realize that the

end of prohibition would place a

greater responsibility on the student
body and suggest the judicial board
punish the misusers’ of alcohol.

if these institutions of learning, ,

Oswego and Bucknell, are allowed
the use of alcohol then they too
will face the decisions Albany must
make within the next few months.
The University at Albany may have
taken the lead for Oswego in end-
ing prohibition, but it remains to be
seen if it retains this lead in form-
ing alcoholic policy.
