'HenVyweight Decides

by Dunc Nixon

The Albany State grapplers fell to a strong Far—

leigh—Dickinson

squad, Saturday, by a close 19—14

cdunt. The match was in doubt all the way, as the
score was tiled 14-14 going into the final match, and

unfortunately for the State

squad. Joe Kutiniewski of

F.D.U. came ,up with a clutch performance as he
pinned Chet Krom in 15 seconds of the third period.

F.D.U. jumped into an
early lead when Ed Chris-
tiansen outpointed Bill
Russell 11-3 in the 123
pound class. Russell Who
won the Quadrangular at
115 just did not have enough
size.

Albany quickly evened the score
as Warren Crow completely dom-
inated his man, but was unable to
register a pin. He won by an amaz-
ing 20-1 count. In the next two
weight classes F.D.U. had Metro-
politan champions and both proved
to be too much for their Albany
counterparts.

Roger Locks decisioned State’s
Mike Poplaski 5-2 and AI Ferrari
turned back Quadranguiar champion
Randy Palmer by a 7-2 margin.
Ferrari's win put F.D.U. out in
front 0-3 but the State grapplers
got hot.

Sprlnger and Barry Score

Craig Springer took the mat for
Albany at 152 and easily disposed
of his man by a decision 13-5 Score.
Frank Berry, another Quadrangular
champ, also won easily, as he reg-
istered a 6-0 victory to tie the
match score at 9-9.

Captain Art Recesso followed
Berry, and he made short work ofhis
opponent, as herregistered a pin at
1:01 of the second period. This pin
gave Albany a 14-0 lead with two
matches to go. However, coach Ga-
cia still had reason to worry.

His regular 17'? pounder, Roger
Gorham had an infected foot, so
coach Garcia was forced to go with
Tony Caputo, a complete novice.
Caputo, who hashad approximately
three weeks wrestling experience,
showed promises, but the exper-
ience of the Fairleigh-Dickinson
wrestler proved to be too much.
F.D.U.'s pin at 1'77 tied the match
at 14-14 and set the stage for the
ill-fated heavyweight encounter.

The grapplers will be out to even
their record this Thursday when
they host Plattsburgh at 7:30 pm.

Frosh Drop Opaner

The Fairleigh Dickinson frosh
team forfeited four matches to the
Albany frosh wrestling team to give
us a 20 point starting score. The
visitors then went on defeat the
trash in the remaining 5 matches
for a 21-20 win. The forfeits went
to George Hawrylchak at 123, Pete
Klara at 145, Rod Stancil at 167
and John Jenks the heavy weight of
the team.

Three of these grapplers fought
exhibition matches to keep in prac-
tice, but had no bearing on the team
score. Hawrylchak was defeated by
Fairleigh Dickinson's Ted Levine,
Klara was pinned in the third period
by Pat Nobilio and Jenks was de-
feated in one of the few close
matches. ~

The first competitive match was
between Alex Domkowski for Albany
and Fairleigh Dickinson's Doug Cun-
ningham. The 130 weight class match
ended in a pin at 2:54Intothe second
period.

Impressive Against Cardinals

The Plattsburgh contest was a
tight battle after the start of the
second half. It was nip and tuck all
the way until Marcus putit away with
his two foul shots and the Dane de-
fense held on to give State their sec-
ond win of the year. The Sauersmen
held a slim four-point lead at the
half, 33-28, coming from behind 28-
19 to drop in 14 points while holding
the Cardinals scoreless.

Scott Price, a 6’2" junior from

Dane scoring with 1’7 markers, with
Mike Bloom hitting for 14 points
and Rich Margison for 13. Marcus,
the team’s’ leading scorer at the
start of the game was held to 10

Women To Compete
In First Sports Day

by Iris Alson

The Albany State Women’s Inter-
collegiate Basketball Team will open
its 1966-67 season Feb. 18 with a
Sports Day at New Paltz. Our girls
will have a very trying day, repre-
senting us against 5 different
schools. ‘

Practices at Page Gym

The girls have been practicing
since Nov. 15 every Tues. and Thurs.
night from 6 to 7:30. They start with
15 minutes of rigorous conditioning
which really seems to have paid off.
Part of the conditioning includes 12
laps around the gym.

The conditioning is followed by
work on passing techniques and de-
fensive tactics. The girls have been
practicing zone and man-to-mandc-
fenses. There is then practice in
lay-ups and foul shooting with spa.
cial emphasis on rebounding. Sev-
eral plays have been et up and the
possibility of a fast break has been
stressed.

Rules Changed

The rules have been changed again
for this year’s games. From the LI
dribble limit of last your there is
now unlimited dribbling permitted.
There Is still its 3 foot rule for
passes from outuof-bounds. Free
throws must be made within lOSec-
onds.

Miss Ronnish, the town's adviser,
has really been working the girls
hard, and It seems to be getting ru—
sults. She’s working on the schedule
now and is trying to fit in as many
games as possible. This year’s team
will be playing several schools State
hasn’t played in intercollegiate com-
petition before.

The fresh and upperclassmen are
showing great enthusiasm and must
really be devoted to gotln'oughtheir
rough practices.

Graduate Students
To Ctr-Sponsor
Informal Gathering

An International Holiday Festival
will be co-sponsored by the inter-
national Students Association and the
Circle Twenty Club on Monday eve-
ning, Dec. 19. The Festival will be
held in the Sayles Hall lounge be-
ginning at 8 p.m.

An informal gathering is planned
featuring musical entertainment
with an international flavor. Re-
freshments will be served. The event
will offer an opportunity for infor-
mal contact between all international
students and graduate students. All
students, especially undergraduate
foreign students, language students,
graduate students, and their guests
are cordially invited.

This Is the first function of the
recently organized Circle Twenty
Club. The Club was conceived after
the recent outing, sponsored for
Grad Students, held at the Mohawk
Campus. At that time, a group of
students felt the need to continue to
sponsor social and cultural events
of particular interest to the Grad-
uuie Students of Albany State.

The International Holiday is the
first of a series of events to be held
for Grad students. it is hoped that
this function will add to the impetus
of the inauguration of a Graduate
Student Assooiation. The growing
graduate student population will then
have the means for meetings Its
special needs. This association
would provide a separate govern-
mental structure for graduate stu-
dents which would parallei the func-
tion of the Undergraduate Student
Association.

SUNY At Binghamton Passes

New Campus

The Council of the State Uni-
versity of New York at Binghamton
has laid down new policy under
which‘ beer, along with other re-
freshments, may be served to stu-
dents during a limited number of
on-campus social events.

The new policy applies at present
only to “all-campus" social events,
the principal ones being Winter
Weekend and Spring Weekend. Beer
may be served only to students 18
and older and only under the spon-
sorship of a recognized student or-
ganization. When served it must be
available to all students oflegal age,
and soft drinks must also be avail-
able at the same time.

Because of these limitations, it is
expected that the Student Center
Board, which sponsors the two ma-
jor weekends and is the only student
organization with budget for all-
campus social events andrefresh-
ments, will be the sole organization
at whose functions beer will be
served. Student Center Board is
supported by student fees, and has
no state money at its disposal.

College regulations continue to
prohibit both the possession and
consumption of alcoholic beverages
on the campus, except as specified
in the new policy for "all-campus"
social events.

President Dearing and Dean licl-
niak pointed out that the Council, a
body appointed by the Governor, has
general responsibility for student
discipline, and that the Council at
each State University unit has auto-
nomy concerning the serving of al-
coholic beverages on campus.

Liqttor Policy

The autonomy of the councils on
the question of beverages was clar-
ified hy the State University last
year.

President Dearing said the ad-
ministrative staff and the Council
deliberated carefully on a recent
request from the United States gov-
ernment that beer be permitted as
a free refreshment at specified
events.

The U.S.G. said that the chief
reason for the request was the in-
creasing difficulty, with growth of
the student body, in renting ade-
quate off-campus halls for student
dances on major social weekends.

The Council recognizedthis prob-
lem, President Dearing said, and
studied it in the context of bever-
ages practices at other institutions.
Service of beer at major on-campus
social events accords with the prac-
tice of many other public and pri-
vate colleges and university in the
Northeast, he said.

Folksinger To Perform
At Golden -Eye Tonight

Folksinger Pat Webb will sing at
The Golden Eye tonight at 9 pm.
Webb has earned a considerable
amount of praise from the journals
and critics of the folk-music world.

The Folk Music Yearbook 01 Al'-
tists in 1964 called him “The
World’s finest blues guitarist, his
skill with the instrument must be
seen to be believed.” Bill-Board
Magazine gave one of his records
a Special Merit Award.

White Gultorlst

B.M.0.C. said "his knowledge of
the instrument is phenomenal, it
must be seen to be believed.” Blues
critic Pete Welding said: "One is
in fact tempted to call him the fi-
nest white guitarist playing in the
blues style, and let it go at that.
Yet not only does his playing possess
the stinging urgency and infectious
rhythmic drive of the blues guitar-
ist, it is also playing of extraordi-
narily acute sensibility and deli-
cacy.”

Mr. Webb also has played at the
Bitter End, and the Gaslight Cafe
In New York City, the Showboat
Lounge in Washington, D.C., and the
Ashgrove in Los Angeles. He has
also made enumerable appearances
at universities, and on TV and radio.

For this evening alone, admission
will be 30¢ at the door.

Announcements at the President’s
Conference Monday included the fact
that the contract between Faculty
Student Association and the State had
been signed. Further financial ar-
rangements in the form of budgets
will be approved at a later date.

Also the Undergraduate Academic
Council will be reviewing programs
for undergraduate degrees.

information concerning the exam
schedule was presented at the Con-
ference. Since the Examination
Team had a choice of 19 conflicts in
9 days or 1 conflict in 10 days, they
chose the latter extending the exam
period to Jan. 27 instead of the
original date of Jan. 26.

A special bus schedule wil be in
effect during exams.

Students with conﬂicts should re-
port to Dr. David Donley or Mr.
Robert Luippold in El. 232 at 457-
8277 and to their instructor.

According to President Collins,
at the time of the Conference Alan
Fossa, who had been found on the
ground outside Waterbury Sunday,
Dec. 4, was still in the hospital
but showing signs of recovery.

After these announcements a dis-
cussion concerning the playing of
Christmas carols in the carillon
followed. A Jewish student com-
plained about the religious nature
of the carols. The student remarked
that since l-iillel was not alloWed to
hold Hanukah services on campus,
why should the carols be played.

President Collins stated that there
was a distinction between a form of
worship and the carols. He said
legal counsel would be obtained on
the matter.
