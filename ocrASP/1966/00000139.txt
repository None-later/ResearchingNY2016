"THE MALTESE FALCON" with Humphrey Bogart will be pre-

sented by the I.F.G. tonight.

Bogartlorre IIeall Ilast In Film.
To Be Presented By lFtl Tonight

Humphrey Bogart as a hard-
boiled, cynical detective is featured
in this Friday’s IFG film, “The
Maltese Falcon."

Called by James Agee “the best
private eye melodrama ever made,”
the film tells of the search for a
valuable jade statuette of a falcon.
Bogart, as Sam Spade, sets out to
avenge the murder of his partner
and finds himself involved with a
psychopathic hoodlum (Peter Lor-
re), a double-dealing woman (Mary
Astor), and a mysterious million-
aire (Sydney Greenstreet)---- all
hunting for the jade bird.

“The Maltese Falcon” was the
first film to be directed by John
Huston, whose career included the
making of “Treasure of the Sierra
Madre," “The African Queen,”
"Moby Dick,” “The List of Adrian
Messenger,” and currently “The

Torurn 0f Politics
Presents Model

Forum of Politics will sponsor its
annual Model United Nations Secur-
ity Council tomorrow, December 17,
in Brubacher Lower Lounge. Par-
ticipating will be 15 area high
schools, involving 60 students and
their advisors.

The object of this event is to ac-
quaint the students with the manner
in which the United Nations oper-
ates, and with the role of a diplo-
mat. Each school takes the position
of the country of the Security Coun-
cil it represents on the resolutions
before the body; not the students’
personal opinion. A prize is awarded
to the school that does the best job,
as well as to the best individual
speaker.

This year's program is different
than in the past; for the first time,
hypothetical issues will be debated,
instead of actual United Nations
resolutions. The first issue, follow-
ing Forum President Harold Lynne's
welcoming speech, concerns Niger-
ia. According to the situation pre-
sented to the delegates, the Eastern
section, called Umanna, has with-
drawn from the country and allied
itself with the Cameroons.

The second issue will follow a
speech by Dr. Lois Stone, associate
professor of political science at
State. it assumes that the United
Nations has effected a temporary
cease fire in Vietnam, and has a
police force stationed in that coun-
try. The problem is to make this
a permanent cease fire, and a fi-
nal end to the conflict.

Members of Forum of Politics
will assume the roles of the United
Nations officials, and help the
schools on their positions. Howard
Stein is President of the Security
Council and Barbara Lande is Sec-
rotary-General. The delegation ad-
visors are Judy Bank, Donna Gavel,
Harry Goldberg, Herman Green and
Bob Obenshain.

The first issue will be discussed
from 10:00 to 11:30 a.m., the niece.
and from 1:00 to 3:30 p.m. The talk
by Dr. Stone will begin at 12:30
p.m. Everyone is welcome to view
the event.

Bible." Many critics feel he never
surpassed the intensity and sordid
realism of his first picture.

"The Maltese Falcon” is the last
IFG film of the semester and will
be shown at 7:00 and 9:15 in Draper
349. Admission is 35¢ with student
tax, 50¢ without.

Schedules for next semester’s
lFG programs (to include “The
Knack,” "The Seventh Seal,” “Yo-
limbo," “On the Waterfront,“ and
"Psycho”) will be available in late
January or early February.

Practice To Begin

Mr. John Martin Gunn, faculty
coach (of the University’s G.E. Col-
lege Bowl Team, has announced the
ten semi-finalists from which the
final five for the team will bechosen. r
In alphabetical order, they are Frank
Burd, Fred Childs, Lawrence Ep-
stein, William Gross, Thomas
Myles, John Shea, Lynn Scheinman,
John Spross, Barbara Weinstein,
and Allan Zucker. '

     
    
   

The ten semi-finalists held their
first drill Monday evening. The next
one is schedules for this afternoon
in Richardson Hall. This will be the »
first chance for the team to use the
mock studio with the individual buz-
zers and glaring lights.

At the first drill, the team did
best in literature, but still was weak
in some areas. Mr. Gunn has de-
cided not to search for any more
candidates, and to concentrate on
plugging up holes.

Gunn was still undecided about
the desirability of any drills over
the Christmas vacation. He would
very much like to have no drills
over the vacation for obvious rea-
sons, yet he admitted that time is
short and that he feels “the noose
around my neck a little bit."

In the event the team does have
a practice over the vacation, ar-
rangements are being made for the
team members to stay in their
dorms.

Arrested Students
Release Statement

We, the students who were ar-
rested on Election Day, feel com-
pelled to make a statement in our
own behalf. inasmuch as the Mayor
has expressed concern that we might
be “misinformed,” we think it is
important that the public be aware
of what we think and how we feel
about the whole issue.

First, we would like to commend
the Mayor’s research on the origin
of the word picket. We feel it would
do justice to any high school student
in reference to the Hay Market riot
oi the 1880’s, however, he uses non
sequitor logic in attempting to apply
this to Nov. 8, 1966.

"Picketing is always accompanied
by peace—disturbing activities and
there necessarily follow (sic) alarm
and interference and some degree of
intimidation...” The Mayor again
uses faulty logic when he states,
"it would appear that picketing of a
polling place on Election Day must,
by its nature, interfere in some
manner with the free exercise of the
voting privilege.”

We do not feel that the voters
were in any way intimidated, and
when Mayor Corning was asked if
any complaints were made, he said
that to his knowledge there were
none.

The second point we wish to bring
up concerns the legality of the is-
sue. lf the picketers Were breaking
section ‘7'72-A of the Penal Law;
first, why were the twenty-five stu-
dents, ciergymen and Brothers who
picketed after B p.m. not arrested?

Second, why were the charges
dropped and the picketers released;
and last, why did the Attorney Gen-
eral's office tell two of the picketers
prior to arrest that they were within
their rights.

The Mayor seems to feel that the
charges were dropped because
"many of the individuals could have
been misinformed," whereas Albany
attorney Victor Lord feels the

charges were dropped because “the

district attorney and the police...
didn't have a leg to stand on.
We think that Mr. Lord's explan—

ation is more tenable and we frankly
resent the Mayor's. We were hilly

aware of what we were doing.

In conclusion we would like to

thank the Albany clergyman who is-

sued their supporting statement as'
well as the AAUF and Faculty Sen-

ate at Albany State and all other
groups who have taken similar ac-
tion.

-l'nl Theta lived together in the some
dorm. This year they were separated
and are living with independents.
The dorms are divided into two
sides: one side for the sorority, the
other for the independents. Accord-
ing to both sorority presidents, Miss
Kathleen Brown (Chi Sigma Theta)
and Miss Karel Huffman (Beta Zeta),
the members of the sororities at
first did not like the idea of separ-
ating, but soon found they were com-
patible with independents.

The women living with Beta Zeta
are mainly upperclassmen. These
independents are allowed Into the
sorority’s living quarters and the
two groups m’ingle freely, according
to Miss Huffman. Many of the in-
dependents have acquired the char-
acteristic indifference of upper-
classmen. Because of the friend-
ship and the indifference the inde-
pendents tend to be easy goingdorm
partners for Beta Zeta.

Miss Brown's sorority shares its
dorm with a majority of freshmen.
Although a sorority member can
Visit a freshman the visit cannot be
returned since freshmen are not
allowed in sorority corridor until
the spring rush. This may be a
disadvantage but it is balanced by
the freshmen’s interest in doom
activities. Chi Sigma Theta has,

turn gave the sorority a greater
outlook on campus life.

Hours For Women

, The State University of New York
at Buffalo abolished hours for upper-
ciass women on Monday, Dec. 5.
The proposal to eliminate curfews
for sophomore, junior and senior
women was passed by the Commit-
tee on Student Affairs of the Uni-
versity Faculty Senate.
The new plan was to take effect
on or after Dec. 8. The date is to
be decided by each residence hall
council. The basic proposal was
first introduced In September of this
year. At that time, the inter-Resi-
dence Judiciary Curfew Committee
drew up a proposal based on the
honor system.
All extended curfews, blanket per-
missions and weekend signout pro-
cedures are now eliminated. Resi-
dents planning to return late will
leave the phone number and address
: of their destination in a sealed en-
_ velope. Only failure to check in an
’ hour after expected.return would

necessitate opening the envelope.

Dean of Women Jeanette Scudder
stated "The University believes that
