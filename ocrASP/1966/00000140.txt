Debate leam
Places Fourth
In Invitational

Last Saturday the University's
Varsity Debate team placed fourth
out of 22 schools competing in the
RPI Invitation Tournament, winning
3 out oi 12 debates.

University debaters Douglas Aus-
ter, Gerry Gees, Marc Miringoff,
and StrattonRawson debated on the

is concerned with the U. S. Foreign
Policy.

The topic in question is specifi-
cally resolved that "That the United
States should substantially reduce
its Foreign Policy Commitments."

Auster and Miringoff, who repre-
sented the alflrmative side of the
team, won five out of six debates
and finished second to the U. S.
Military Academy in the aiiirma-
tive category.

Other schools represented were
the United States Military Acad-
emy, Yale University,Vassar,NYU,
and SUNY at Binghamton, and this
marked the eighth tournament in
which Albany has participated.

“What I want to do is to
start a new literary mag-
azine — and a literary
magazine whichis notb'eing
written by one esoteric
group of writers.

“It does not have to be
Albany State’s version of
the "New Yorker." and
those students .who have
never submitted anything
for publication should not
be afraid to submit ma—
terial.”

These are the primary goals of
Rhoda Goldberg, '08, in taking steps
to secure support for the publication
of a new campus literary magazine
which would appear three times a
semester.

as the prospective editor, Miss
Goldberg, along with Mrs. Patricia
Osterrelch and Louise Meyers,
would prefer to see the magazine
printed, bound and covered, rather
than mimeoed or dittoed, and is
therefore seeking to receive finan-
cial aid from the Student Associa-
tion.

Hopefully she would like to be
able to begin regular publication
next semester, and therefore is al-
ready seeking contributors in all
literary fields for the first issue.

“Thursday” first conceived

         
  

Hollies left the University,.t
with him most of_ the noses ’
equipment for the continuance of
“Thursday.”

The new magazine would be on
the order of "Thursday," and would
be oriented in the ﬁelds in Hu-
manities but she hopes it will be
more encompassing in coverageand
contributors than the former
"Thursday," or “Primer.”

ideally the new magazine will
encompass poetry and all types of
short fiction, as well as contain-
ing essays, modern criticism and
reviews. _

She would like to cover all fields
of modern thought with the excep-
tion of politics and religion, as she
feels these are adequately covered
by "suppression" and “strandalon.”

One point she is most emphatic
about is that she wants to operate
under a system whereby all con-
tributors receive acceptance and'
rejection notices, a system not pro-
sently used by any other campus
publications.

Her ideas were summed up in her
statement that she wants a maga-
zine that will “swing” and will be-
come “a true reﬂection of the way
students are thinking and writing
not only on this campus, but even-
tually on other campuses too."
