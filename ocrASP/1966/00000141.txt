Edward Durable Superstone, Obliteroting Ugliness —

Bireclory Commended

In the last weeks the resultsof much
student effort has made itself evident
in improvements which we feel are es-
pecially noteworthy. Two of these. the

remainder of ‘our community; until we
are somewhat self-sufficient.

Most of the problems are self—cre-
ating. It is clear that neither Col. Tis—
dale nor the Administration are at fault.
There are, however. certain situations
with could stand rectification.

’66 Student Directory, and Christmas

Sing ’66 show definite initiative taken
by’ those in charge of organizing them;
two of these, the new Traffic Appeals
Court, and the Birth Control Series are

new innovations.

Although some comment was made

about the delayed arrival

Rare, indeed. is the opportunity to
drive between the Service Building and
the Colonial Quad without getting stuck
behind a stopped bus. Many students be-
lieve that since they are school buses,
they must stop and wait forthem. Others

the wait. Editor Mary Jane Elia (un-

Consider the narrow (2 lane) roadways,

named in the directory) has edited a
directory which shows an unprecedented
degree of professionalism and conven-
ience. The new Director has, beside the
institution of a smaller type face which
makes location of numbers, also added
yellow pages.

Bus-fling community

Owing to the nature of the site our
University is built upon. namely isola-
tion, bussing has become a temporary
part of our lives. This situation will
continue until we have completed the

the practice of campus police and “offi-
cial” cars of stopping wherever it is
.most convenient. the usual percentage of
poor and thoughtless drivers among our
students, staff and faculty, and the heavy
traffic at times, and you have a danger-
ous situation. Let’s not wait for a few
deaths before we do something.

Either the bus stops should be in-
dented from the roadway. to allow the

free flow of traffic. or the bus stops
should be moved to alleviate the danger.

South got back to his hand by

club and Soutil played a ileart back

by Richard Bets and Marty Bergen

Most of the time it is easy to
play a contract when all four hands
are in view. Take today's hand
which was played at a recent dup-
licate game. South opened two no-
trump on twenty-three points and
was raised to six no-trump by his
partner.

Six no trump is a slight overbid
but maybe North had supreme con-
fidence in his partner's play of the
hand. It is easy to make six no-
trump seeing all four hands.

All that is needed is a right
guess in the club suit and declarer
can make twelve tricks: five clubs,
two diamonds, two hearts, and tilree
spades. However, the problem is
to make all thirteen tricks which
is hard enough with all four hands
exposed but taking note that de-
clarer did it seeing only his hand
and dummy's.

Declarer was fortunately pre-
sented with a favorable lead of a
low spade. The low spade lead is
probably the worst lead in the West
hand, a heart or diamond lead being
definitely superior. Declarer played
the ten of spades from dummy hoping
the queen was in the East hand and
that East would cover.

however, this was not the case

"Times" Critic Summarizes

John Corbin, "The Times" thea-
tre critic sums up the story in the
following manner: "There is the
eager young clerk in a country
store to whom the movies are the
summed up beauty of the universe.
...he believes everything he reads
about the screen, the interviews in
fan magazines, the glowing state-
ments of press agents. Illusions?
He has them all.

“And then he goes to Hollywood.
He has graduated from a corres-
pondence school of acting- he has
his diploma and everything- and he
makes his pilgrimage to his mecca
to act....and to worship Beaulah
Baxter.

“And his illusions? Well.Sigmund

used a double she would feel that she
was not keeping faith with her pub-
lic.

“Merton ls shattered. But only
for a time. lie still warships the
screen and will give it the best that
is in him... and (finally) Merton bo—
conles a great actor.“

"Merton" To Be Produced

“Merton oi the Movies” will he
produced here in the middle of
March. Auditions will be held on
Doc. 19 alld 20 ill Page llall.

James Leonard, who directedlasi
year’s entry into the Yale Drama
Festival, “Of Mice and Men” will
direct “Merton.” Leonard spoke of
the play as a longing for innocence.
Merton is blinded by idealism, but
we love him and long to be as in-
nocent as he is.

The idea of doing a 1:122 comedy
is all part of the old movies fad
fad and nostalgia which speaks to a
contemporary impulse and coils-
ciousnoss. It is part of the whole
movement in the new arts revival
which can be exemplified in the

song hit, “Winchester Cathedral."

pulse, a regaining of a lost national
interest, and ill effecl the pitting
for a lost virginity.

‘Iexas Across The River’ Iiresome
Called 'BatI-Batl’ Movie By Critic

by Douglas Rothgeb

A man by the name of Norman Holland oncewrote
an intriguing little essay on what he called the “good
bad movie," as opposed to the “bad bad movie.” He
described the former as a movie which is unpreten—
iiously bad, one which does not claim to be more than
it is and which seeks only to entertain.

“Texas Across Tile River“ will

His paintings are rele-
vant as suggestions of fem-
inine form. but his work is
e s senti ally decorative.
This is because he does not
want one to become in-
volved only with the indi-
vidual figure itself.

Rather, the painter wants one to
gather the emotional response from
the composite of a series of these
undulating forms. Thus, the paint-
ings are fragmented and tend to ap-
pear as problems of design.

The connotation of ‘aesrgn' in-
stead of ‘art’ does not dissatisfy
Bosson since the paintings are or-
ganized intrinsically and are,tilere-
fore, unified. Art criticism is in-
dividual and, since the works are
valid compositionaliy the interpre-
tation can, therefore, remain per-
sonal. ,

Bosson is able, after securing
attention to his unique style through
the use of contrasting colors,
involve you in ills satirization of
ills masculine i'rlcaiization of the
female image. lie believes that man
tends to view the woman idealisti-
ctllly as a composite of many por-
icnr forms.

r‘layiuliy Satirlc

Bosson is playfully satiric be-
cause, by decomposing thc telltale
form, Ile shows us that women are
actually more than these segments.
They are complex human beings who
are incapable of severe and rigid
sub-divisions.

Simple forms are used to create
these complex situations as the ar-
tisi sees the need for personal in-
terpretation of his paintings. By
presenting the fragments of the
nude instead of the entire figure, he
allows each person to discover the
satire as it is related to tile Indi-
vidual experience. The truth of real-
ity is thus made palatable by splay-
fui presentatinn.

Use of Color

The artist's use of color is per-
sonally symbolic but does not he-
cessarily conform to the conven-
tional color interpretations. His
reds, blues, and greens are used
lil an attempt to communicate the
activity of life through an emo-
tional response.

Although the color is flat and free
from textural quality, a visual ii-

8

is nevertheless confined by the
limits of its environment.

Approach Direct

As previously stated, there is
a playful quality to Jack Bosson’s
paintings. This, however, does not
suggest that his work is insincere.
His statement and his approach are
direct so that the paintings are valid.

His art is honest because, to him,
it is a truthful expression of his
present attitudes about people and
about life. To the artist, his paint-
ings fulfill the function of art,which
is the expression of the individual.
That one may View his ideas in Hu-.
manities 354 until January 6, 1967
is an invaluable experience to view
playful reality which should not be
bypassed.

Faculty Concert

Overall Success,
Individuals Praised

by Deborah Kirsch

In typically Baroque style, Pur-
celi’s "Sonata" in D Major which
opened the faculty concert program
iii Page last Friday, followed the
fast-slow-fnst form for the move-
ment. Dr. James Morris was fea-
tured on trumpet, accompanied by
Findlay Cockrell on piano.

The style of the first movements
of this piece has great rhythmic
vitality, which Morris was able to
emphasize. The second movement
was unusual in that it featured only
the piano ill a slow, solemn, ex-
pressive theme in a minor key.

Small Sulto

"Mnrcllcnerzahlungen" are four
character pieces forming a small
suite by Schumann. They are musi-
cal fairy tales, for clarinet, viola.
and piano.

In this trio, William Hudson was
featured on clarinet, Dr. Charles
Stokes, played viola and Findlay
Cockrell performed on piano. The
blending of the mellow haromoniesv
of the viola and clarinet was ap-
parent.

volume of the pane seemed to
overshadow the other two Instru-

Unusual Piece

Wltllout question, the most un-
usual place on the program was
"Rorl Veiocitaiem" by Richmond
Browne for any three instruments.
“lieri Velocliatem" consists offivc
pnges of "music" which are played
ill order, each performer starting,
however, with a different page, so
that ll movement is a partly ran-
dom superimposition ofthraepuges.

The three instruments used were
once (played by Patricia Grignet),
trumpet (Morris), and French horn
(Nllnetz). The extreme ranges ofall
the instruments were used, lil con-
trast and opposition to eacll other,
creating a pointililstic affect.

Tile Beethoven “Quintet” was the
higil point of the program. Scored
for piano, obcu, clarinet, French
horn and bassoon (played by Miss
Juno l’llrich, Albany Symphony Or-
chestra performer), it represented
one of Beethoven's earlier works.

This quintet contrasts the instru-
ments in pairs, three against two,
or, often, the piano in opposition
to the winds. Throughout some or
the first movement, the piano again
seemed to overwhelm the winds.

The winds, again, blended well,
although the bassoon, at times,
seemed to become lost in the maze
ofsound.
