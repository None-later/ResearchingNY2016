A SP sports section experience and enthusiasm it hasn't
known in a good longWhile. Glen Sapir will take over as
associate sports editor. Both men have outstanding
staffs, and I’m sure this page will improve consid-
erably during the next few months.

I am now confronted with a situation I have not
known for five semesters, and that is to be able to
write a column without fear of offending someone and
subsequently eliminating a source of information. It’s
a once in a lifeteime opportunity unfortunately, and
I’m sorry I didn’t have this freedom while still sports
editor.

This column has always been a proponent of keep—
ing our athletic system apace with the university’s
sudden and vast growth. In the past three years it is
my opinion that such has not at all been the case. In
fact, the reverse comes closer to being true. Bluntly,
athletics have been forced into such a backseat ar-
rangement that it will be years—a good many years—
behind the rest of the school’s growth. even to the
point where it may never catch up. People expect
bigger and better things from a University than from
a Teacher’s College—including athletics. And can we
say that we have ,been moving in such a forward di-
rection?

New athletic director Dr. Werner is a step in the
right direction. He has the desire and experience to
effect a solid athletic program here at Albany. The
coaching staff expands and improves annually. But
these factOrs are negligible when not given full uni-
versity and student body support, and that support is
not being given.

Not until this school encourages athletics in some
form other than a seasonal banquet, not until facilities
are provided for adequate intercollegiate and intra—
mural activities, not until athletics regain the respect
they have lost will we have a University sports-wise.

was the thriller anticipated
as Dane fans watched a 12
point halftime lead dwindle
to one, then saw the game
put out of reach in the fi-
nal 58 seconds.

The Bears jumped off to a quick
7-0 lead before Larry Marcus put
the Danes into the scoring with a
shot from the corner. After that
both teams traded baskets, as the
Potsdam men clung to a slim lead.
Then with 3:22 left in the half, State
started to click. Tom Doody hit
from the outside, Scott Price on a
foul shot, Jim Constantino from
center, and Rich Margison put the
Danes ahead at 2:06 with a jump
shot from the center 33-32.

Constantino dropped in another
two as the half was ending and State
put the lid on the Bears taking a
44-32 halftime lead.

Convert 26 Foul Shots

The second lialf was a foul shot
contest, won by Potsdam, as the
Bears converted a total of 26 free
throws in the game, most in the
last half. Glenn Murray made two
to make the score 67-66 at 4:27
as Potsdam whittled State’s lead.
A minute later it was 69-68 as
Murray and Price each hit for two.
Margison hit from under and on a
foul at 2:59 to make it 72-68. With
:49 left it was 76-74, then Larry
Marcus put it on ice from under-
neath and Constantino sunk one as
the clock ran out to give the Danes
the victory, 80-74.

himself disgusted with the earlier
man and has trouble understanding
the early tapes.

Samuel Beckett’s
“Krapp’s Last Tape,” a

one act play featuring one
character, will be pre-
sented at the Golden Eye
tonight at 9 p.m.

The play is an examination of
what is meaningful and lasting in
man's existence. Beckett comes to
the conclusion that existence lacks
meaning.

The story concerns Krapp, played
by Paul Villani, who makes a tape
recording on what he has done and
what his future will be once a year
for thirty years. Over the years he
rejects personal involvement and
becomes more concerned with the
intellectual aspects of life.

Plays Tape Back
When he reaches the age of 69,
he plays all ids topo- hocli. liotlrxis

Krapp comes to the conclusion
that what has gone past can no
longer be.

Villani graduated from the State
University of New York at Albany
in 1962. Soon after graduation he
moved to New York City where he
studied at the Circle in the Square.
He appeared in their production of
Eugene O'Neil's “Desire Under the
Elms.”

SUNYA Graduate Director

“Krapp’s Last Tape" will be di-
rected by John Velie who graduated
from SUNAY in 1962. in 1964 he
won the A. M. Drummond Studio
Award for Direction at Cornell. His
original play, "The East Room,"
was produced at the 1964 Yale Drama
Festival.

After the performance Velie and
Villani will discuss their produc-
tion. There will be no admission
charge for the program.

A form of music free from the
.conscious intent of the composer,
‘poems composed from aworld with-

out attempting to use it as a “sub-
ject,” are only two of the topics
to be presented by leaders in var-
ious fields of the modern arts at
the State University at Albany,
Tues., February 14 at 8:00 p.m.,
in the Campus Center Ballroom.

A team of seven men will give a
unique presentation of topics in the
fields of music, poetry, painting,
photography and sculpturing at this

board.

this New Theatre movement include

‘ ‘Wollionsliy To Teach Extra Year
Granted Third Extended Tenure

Madame Catherine Wolkonsky, professor of Rus-
sian language and literature at SUNYA, has been
granted a one year extension of waiver of mandatory
retirement by the Board of Trustees of the State Uni—
versity Of New York. This At Albany she has charge of the

expressionism; however, his paint-
ings in the area of landscape and
sea indicate variations from this
'style. His most recent works havo
depicted a ﬂat and diagrammatic
disposition of line.

In the field of scuplturing, Len
Lye, born and educated inNew Zeal-
and, bgt now an American citizen,
first exhibited his “tangible” mo-
tion sculpturing in 1961.

His most impressive work to date
consists of a five-fooi-high blade of
polished steel which is electron-
ically choreographed to go into con-
vulsive motions upon a revolving
base. He feels that each individual
will receive from his sculpture a
similar degree of empathetic re-
action.

"Alouforic" Music

Greek Week

Paine, and Dick Foley, who were
brothers in the same fraternity at
the University of Washington. They
had already started singing together,
but it was strictly for laughs.

Then one day, as a result of a
joke which a friend had pulled on
them, they auditioned for the mana-
ger of a popular night spotln Seattle.
They were hired, of course, and if
up until then they neglected to take
themselves seriously as singers,
The Brothers Four suddenly began
to think of terms of a professional
career.

Not long after that, they weredis-
covered by their manager, Mort
Lewis, and were winging their way
to fame and fortune with their first
recording, "Greenfieids," which
sold more than a million copies.
The Brothers Four have piled one
successful venture upon another with
monotonous regularity.

The meteroic rise of The Brothers
Four and their continuingpopularity
makes it look all too easy. So they
give a word of advice to young,
would-be folk-singers: Don't try the
same formula. It "works" only if
you happen to be blessed with talent
to spare, and that, in anutsheil, is
the secret behind the amazing suc-
cess of The Brothers Four.
