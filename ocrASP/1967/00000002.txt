Progress’ 7
v V l L _ I h by Ken Bernstein .
I ,The final Central Council Meeting of the first se-



 

mester Was highligited by two progress reports given

.by faculty members of the ocuncil. Mr: Neil Brown
7 reported substantial progress by the Alcohol-on-Cam-
‘ pus committee. However, a report of "no progress"

on the women's hours proposal by Dr. Clara Tucker

led to a lengthy discussion
of the methods andproced-
urea used in passingapro-
posal.‘

Dr. Tucker reported that her
sub-committee of the Student Af-
fairs Council had not yet made a
report to the Council. She claimed
that some of the proposals discussed
were "not really satisfactory" and
were not shown to be representative
of student opinion.

Wrong Aspect

Furthermore, Dr. Tucker sug-
gested that the committee has so
far been concentrating on the wrong
aspect of the problem; the adminis-
tration of the rules. She believed
that new concepts of the problem
should be explored, even to the point
of abolishing all limitations on wo-
men.

At this point, council’s newest
member, Dr. Richard Kendall com-
plained about the amount of time
the women's hours proposal had
been under discussion, and called
for quicker action on all proposals
of importance to the student body.
Kendall also criticized the sub-
committee for a lack of courage.

Kendall then pointed out that the
student body changed completely
every four years, and asked if a
new consensus would have to be
reached. He suggested that there
be some administrative leadership
instead.

Brown's report Was more de-
tailed. Brown reported that his com-
mittee had thirty-seven consideral»

   
  

’omon’s , Hours

tions to discuss, and had completed
eleven of them. The committee's
latest meeting dealt mainly with the
uses of the campus Center, which
should open very soon after the
second semester beans. The com-
mittee has decided to propose that
there be no “one beverage" policy
that is followed at other schools
Brown believes that the beverag’
served should be in accord with
the type of event taking place.

Track Club

Council approved an appropriation
of $2,771.00 for a track club that
will participate in running events
only. The club will try to schedule
six meets for this spring, and if it
proves satisfactory, it would be
advanced to varsity status in 1968.

Former Architect in Supervise

University’s New Art Gallery

Donald Mochon, a prominentTroy
professor, will be director of the
large art gallery now under con-
struction on the University's new
campus.

Mochon, who will assume his new
post next September, has served for
20 years in faculty and administra-
tive positions withRensselaer Poly-
technic lnstitute's School of Archi-
tecture.

On his new position with the Uni-
versity Gallery Mochon stated that
“The new art gallery at the State

ASP F aster Child Drive
Fails To Meet Intended Goal

A total of $91 towards an $180
goal has been collected by the Al-
bany Student Press in their annual
fund drive to raise money for the
ASP foster child Graciela.

A sum of $71 was collected in
individual pro-Christmas student
donations and an additional $20 was
collected from donations by Beta
Zeta, Kappa Delta, and Sigma Alpha
sororities.

A special appreciation is deliv-
ered to all students who contributed
to the drive, and also to.those sor-
orities who made donations in re-
sponse to letters of request.

The ASP Staff presently has an
additional $10.00 in the foster child
line, however, an additional $79.00
is still necessary to meet the goal.
It is hopeful that those fraternities
and sororities who did not contri-
bute will reconsider.

Progress Report
In the latest progress report re-
ceived by the Staff from the Foster
Parents Plan, Inc., it was stated
that Graciela is "now a smart and
sociable child and she likes to
study.”

The report went on to describe
family conditions. ller father earns
$30.00 a year and the family's main
expense is the rent, including light
and water, of $12.50 a year. They
added that “Thanks to the Plan's
help they have been able to buy
clothing and shoes for the family
and their food is better now... your
help and understanding is not only
an economic help but a moral sup-
port for the family."

The latest letter from Graciela
states:

Dear foster parents,

I don’t go out for vacations yet,
we have to do the final exams and
we will go out on December 9 that
will the closing act. I have been
very happy and I studied hard to
pass the year and to be promoted
to 4th grade, then I wish to continue
with the high school.

During vacation time I will be at
home. I will play and have little
trips with my friends from school.
I wish you every happy Christmas
and a prosperous New Year.

I received the donation of $8.00
and a wool sweater. Many thanks.

Teller, Noted Scientist
Talks On The Moon

by Gary Restlfo

Dr. Edward Teller, Professor-
. At-Large of physics at the Univer-
sity of California at Berkeley was
introduced by Dr. Earl Droesler,
Vice President of Research and De-
velopment at the University, to a
capacity crowd Wed. evening, Feb.
8, in the Dutch Cafeteria.

Teller spoke on the topic "After
The Moon, What Next?" in the third
in a series of symposium lectures
on science and the future of man
sponsored by the College ofthe Arts
and Sciences.

Teller expressed his ideas as to
how a moon landing will enhance our
knowledge of our planet and open
new chemical experiments because
of the changing surface of the moon.

He also pointed out thatit wouldn’t
actually matter who won the race
to the moon; the key factor lies it
what is done after this goal 5
achieved. The knowledge.tralned by
being able to study the moon is the

real measure of successinthe moon
race.

He is confident we shall reach the
moon by 1970," and the space pro-
gram, in spite of the disaster of
losing three “brave men," is not
going to be changed.

“To reach father than man has
done ever before, some must risk
their lives. We knew this all along.
Now we know it in a different way.”
Teller also stated he would like to
see the “exploration and proper
exploitation of space," and he can
see a scientific colony on the moon
for the best study of lunar proper-
ties.

With the help of a nuclear reac-
tor placed on the moon, a colony
could be somewhat self-sufficient
and pave the way for a refueling
station for a ﬂight to Mars.

Teller's address was taped by
educational TV, Channel 17, for
broadcast and distribution to other
stations throughout the country.

'l‘wo atmospheric scientists have
been added to the University faculty,
Dr. Abdul Jabber Abdullah and Dr.
Bernard Vonnegut. '

' Vonnegut comes to the University

‘ after a long affiliation with the Ar-

thur D. Little, Inc., Cambridge,
lass; and Abdullah comes to the

I University from the National Cen-

ter for Atmospheric Research at

1 Boulder, Colorado, where he was

a visiting scientist.

Abdullah’s main interest lies in
the hydrcnamlcs of the atmosphere,
and Vonnegut is particularly con-
cerned with atmospheric electrical
research.

Both scientists have a mutual in-
terest in determining the mechanics
of severe storms. In the past Von-
negut has quoted from reports of
theoretical studies of the subject
made by Abdullah; the pair first
met on an earlier occasion when
Abdullah lectured at the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology.

Electrical Origins

Vonnegut first proposed the idea
that thunderstorm electricity may
originate from the transport of space
chirge in the updrafts and doWn-
drafts of thunderstorms, and that
the action of thunderstorm elec-
tricity may possibly be important
in the formation of precipitation and
in tornadoes.

While in Cambridge, Vonnegut,
working in association with Cha. 4:
Moore, devoted a major portion
his activities to research into at-
mospheric electricity and cloud phy-
sics.

Vonnegut 'will teach a graduate
course in atmospheric electricity
in the University's Department of
Eath and Atmospheric Sciences of
which Dr. Nayaran R. Gokhale is
chairman, beginning in Fall ’67.

Dynamic Meteorology
Abdullah will teach a course in
dynamic meteorology, also begin-
ning in Fall ’67; both scientists will
conduct research under Dr. Vince
Shaefer, a former colleague ofVon-
negut, who is the director of the

He is also the author of six buds
and numerous articles appearing'in‘: ‘
various~ publications, and was for
five years the editor-in-chief of

Vonnegut, a native oflndianapolis,
Ind., studied at M.I.T. where he re-
ceived a BS in chemistry in 1936,
and a PhD in physical chemistry
in 1939.

From 1941 to 1945 Vonnegut
worked in various capacities as a
research associate at M.I.T., and
in 1945 he joined the General Elec-
tric Research Laboratory in Sche-
nectady, where he did research on
the super-cooling of metals, and
later in conjunction with Irving
Langmuir and Shafer on cloud seed-
ing.

Cloud Transformation

During this period be devised
several techniques for transform-
ing clouds of supercooled water
droplets into snow crystals by de-
vising techniques of silver nitrate
seeding both from the ground and
from the air.

Vonnegut, formerly of Weston,
Mass., will be joined by his wife
and four of their five sons in his
