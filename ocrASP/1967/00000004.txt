An audience composed mainly of
Albany students‘watched the tense
game of wits which St. Mary's Col-
lege won 200 to 185 at the G. E.
College bowl Jan. 29. The last few
seconds in the game caused the

Albany fans to regain hope that the ,

team might win as the points began
to add up.

St. Mary’s captured the action
in the beginning of the match as
Mary Lou Gallagher answered the
first two toss-up questions before
M.C. Robert Earle could finish the
question. The third question gave
Albany a chance to score when St.
Mary’s buzzed but missed.

Childs Answers

Fred Childs answered "Iceland"
to the question asking for the coun-
try of those named not extending
into the Arctic Circle. The Albany
team gained 20 points on the bonus
question concerning adjectives de-
rived from certain geographical
areas.

Barbara Weinstein answered the
next toss-up and gave Albany the
right to try the bonus. If this tricky
20 pt. bonus had been answered cor-
rectly, the score might have been
just enough different in the end to
give Albany the lead.

This bonus was a brain-teaser

Chosen, trained

n 'The student body of the University
first learned about the invitation to
compete- on the G. E. College Bowl
0 'fr‘om-‘ithe October 27th meeting of
 ‘Central Council. Soon after the an-
nouncement, a series of appoint-
ments, try-outs, and eliminations
occurred that finally led to the

,,;,|,vteam’s appearance on January 29th.

President Collins confirmed the
acceptance of the invitation at his
next news conference, and expressed
confidence in the success of the
team. Mr. John Martin Gunn, pro-
fessor of Television and Dramatic
Arts was chosen as the head coach
of the team. Mr. Gunn was well-
qualified with extensive experience
with television.

No Alibi:

Gunn recruited two line coaches
in early December: Mr. William
Kraus and Mr. Earl Droessler. As
he was making plans to select a
team, Gunn visited area schools
that had participated on the College
Bowl to get some ideas for pre-
paring the team. Gunn stated that

The team did not practice during
the Christmas vacation and concen-
trated on practice sessions to de-
termine the final team. On' Jan. 12,
the four students who were to repre-
sent the team on television played
a team comprised of faculty mem-
bers.

were chosen as alternates.

which showed three squares-that
the team was supposed to divide
into four equal parts. For 30 sec-
onds the Albany four scribbled and
pondered and finally said they didn't
know.

St. Mary’s grabbed the next two
toss-ups but the last question of the
first half was answered by Captain
Childs. lie identified smog as the
result of a temperature inversion.

Holt-Time Score

The score at half-time was 95-
"lo in favor of St. Mary’s. During
the break Childs read a description
of the University while films of the
campus were shown to the TN
audience.

The second half of the game began
with a question concerning the Ten
Commandments which St. Mary’s
quickly answered. St.Mary’s buzzed
and guessed incorrectly at the sec-
ond question which'gave them a
point penalty and gave Albany a
chance at the question.

The Albany team, however, did not
get the chance to answer on the
grounds that there had been con-
sultation which is not allowed on

a toss-up.

bany then answered 5 out of ﬁns
of a bonus question concerning num-

events such as rowing, confusion,
the jazz age, handball, coffee breaks,
lines of latitude and dressing.

Another two toss-ups went to St.
Mary’s. The third question was ans-
wered correctly by Childs after a
wrong guessbv the St.Maru’steam.

Childs quickly grabbed the next
oss-up and the 20 point bonus was
added to the score with the answer
“Isotope.” Childs answared the
third question in a row and the team
won 20 points in the bonus question.

Albany had quickly been adding
points in the last few minutes of the
game. There were about 10 seconds
left in the game and the score was
185-190 in favor of St. Mary’s.
There was just time for a toss-up
which would decide the winner. Al-
bany could answer the question for
ten points to come from behind to
win the game.

There was hope and the audience
went wild, but the question was asked
and Gallagher got to the buzzer first
to give the right answer and win the
game for St. Mary's. The final score '
was 200-186.

Gunn Holds Pro-Game Sessions
During Team’s New York Stay

by Lawrence Epstein

Like pieces of metal attracted to
a magnet, members of the College
Bowl team arrived at their meet-
ing point, the Warwick Hotel on
Saturday. We met in coach John
Gunn’s room at four for a brief
question and answer session. The
answering was pretty brisk and we
were ready to go out and give it
the old college, oops, university,
try.

After a smorgasbord dinner at
the Stockholm restaurant, we went
to the Majestic theatre to see Marat

' de Sade.

The morning of the show we all
got up and went down to breakfast.
We watched the girls of St. Mary’s,
whom we recognized from their
previous appearance on the show,
come and sit at a table opposite
us.

As we sat there sipping our cof—
fee and giving the girls furtive
glances, they gradually surmised
that we were their opponents. Their

 
   

he». .

/

coach came over and introduced
himself, wishing us good luck.

We arrived at the NCB studios at
noon. First there was a meeting
with Robert Earle, the moderator
of the program. lie came attired in
a brown velour shirt and dark cor-
duroy pants. He remained in this
outfit until about twenty minutes
before air time.

We sat around a conference table
going over the rules of the game
and some practice questions. At
one o’clock we went downstairs to
lunch in the cafeteria which is ad-
jacent to the skating rink at Rocke-
feller Center.

The teams intermingled and con-
versation started. Talks went
quickly from subject to subject with
names like Tom Altizer, Bob Dy-
lan and Moondog fleeting in and out
of sentences.

After lunch we went to the studio
for practice and more practice,
make-up and final warm-ups. ‘

ho bonus that they didn't come

   
  
   

At about 4:45 we left the studio,
stood outside and waited until about
5:25 when we walked to our seats

and waited. Then the music... wetn-
troduced ourselves...the commer-
cial was over.

We sat there as three-questions
brushed by and the girls jumped off
to an early lead. As Earle later
said this must be the fastest half
hour on television. The most frus-
trating thing was hitting that button
and nothing happening because
someone had gotten there before
you.

The excitement and tenseness
which we knew would be inevitable
culminated in the final three minutes
when from impossible depths we
rose, thanks mostly to captain Fred
Childs to almost a tie. Suddenly
there was a half minute left. Then,
with exactly eight seconds left, Earle
asked the last question and...they
got it.

It was over now, the weeks of
waiting and pressing buzzers. But
we tried. It was a good, exciting
game with keen competition and little
jealousy.

It was close, almost as close as
it could possibly be and if it was
in the stars (or rather the questions)
that we would be defeated, then this
was the best way to lose.

Representing Albany on the Col-
lege Bowl Team were Fred Childs,
captain; Larry Epstein, Frank Burd
and Barbara Weinstein.

Childs and Burd are both in their
junior year and history majors.
After graduation, they both plan to
do graduate work in preparation for
college level teaching. Epstein is
an English major in his senior year
who also plans to teach on the col-
lege level. Weinslein, a sophomore,

* is an English major.

Practice Session
In addition to the practice ses-
sions held between the members of
the team and the faculty on campus,
the two teams that were present on

I ' the show practiced a game identical

to the actual show (except for the
questions). Of the two practice ses-
sions held, State won one of these
by seventy-five points and lost the
other by ten points.

Each member of the team thought
that these practice sessions held in
the studio were beneficial in pre-
paring for the actual broadcast of
the show.

Preparation

All the team members felt that
preparation for subject matter asked
on the show could not be studied in
any effective manner. Childs felt
that it was "silly to cram." In-
stead, he felt that the type ofknowl-
edge needed was a general knowledge
applicable to many fields.Weinstein
in addition stressed that luck was
a major factor.

A great deal of concentration was
needed for the game according to
Childs. Most of the members did
have private question and answer
periods among friends.

Questions Easy

After the game both Childs and
Burd felt that the questions asked
were much easier than they had
expected. Burd felt that they might
have had a better chance if the
questions were harder. He ex-
plained that this was primarily due
to their weakness in the time re-
quired to answer the questions by
the team.

The main difficulty experienced
by Epstein was not speed in ans-
wering questions but the subject
matter. A stronger emphasis was
placed on subject matter in the
classical era instead of the modern
era which he judged as the better
of the two.

Experience the Best Reward
The real reward to each of the
players was the invaluable exper-

such as the College Bowl. Epstein» *
“appreciated it because of the lm- -

iqueness of the experience."

Interested in films and the gen-
eral art of production, it provided
him with a small insight into the
areas of' make-up, camera set-up
and lighting techniques.

Childs expressedthe entire ex-
perience as "a lot of fun." Like
the' other team members he felt
that it was unfortunate that tele-
vision vlewers placed such an em-
phasis on the performance of the
team as an accurate picture of the
entire college.

Collegian lllIizliids

0n CE College Bowl

by Ken Bernstein

The line outside the NBC studio
in Rockefeller Center was similar
to the lines students suffer through
at Albany State. It was long, dis-
orderly, and the doors were late in
opening. When the line finally did
move, those in the line who reside
In one of the towers saw to their
horror that a ride on an elevator
was the next step.

Yet most people in thelinethought
the wait worthwhile as they were
enjoying a once-in-a—lifetime op-
portunity to cheer for their school
on the G.E. College Bowl. Indeed,
most of those in line believed it was
a once-in-a-llfetlme chance because
pessimism about the teams chances
was prevalent.

Despite the pessimism, almost
everyone was set to enjoy the con-
test, no matter what the result
might be. One student tried to cheer
up some despondent friends by phil-
osophizing: "Even if we lose we
come in second place, and what’s
so bad about that?” '

Once inside the studio, the parti-
sans of Albany State, mostly from
the New York area, but some from
Upstate, showed school spirit to a
degree that has been unknown for
some time. The spirit sagg‘ed some-
what as the opposing team from St.
Mary’s of Indiana began to pull
away, and the "I told you so’s”
were whispered from person to
person.

The thrilling finish is now a thing
of the past, but it enabled Albany
State rooters to leave the studio
proudly, if disappointed. The team
was a credit to the school even in
defeat and its valiant effort left its
rooters commenting such things as,
“We may be No. 2, but we tried
harder."
