Clark Constructs Wall Relief
In Centers Assembly Room

Perhaps one of the most exciting
features of the Campus Center is
what the artist, and creator, A.
William Clark terms an “archi-
tectural wall relief" which he has
constructed on the front wall of
the Assembly Room located on the
second floor of the Center.

Clark, who was commissioned by
the Art Coordinating Committee to
construct the relief after submitting
a general design, is reluctant to
overwork this term, but feels it is
actually the best description of what
he wished to accomplish.

His main objective was to create
as effective a wall reliefas possible
in the time available (one week),
consisting of “visual organiza-
tions," with an emphasis on rich-
ness of surface and texture.

"Hooked" on Surfaces

, Clark stated he was “hooked on

, surfaces - nothing goes in unless it
has a texture." He also feels that
it should provide a background for,
and be an integral part of the room.
He stated that there are no eso-
teric meanings in his choice of ob-
locts which make up the collage of
objects which constitutes the relief.
Rather he selects objects in rela-
tion to their surfaces and interest.
Cloris, for instance, likes to work
with lettofi‘itlliich he feels are “ex.
:lttngj" , ' 3 likes to work with
ioetry, will u lains his selection
from an e. .cummings poem which
is written in ,woooen letters on the
collage. However, he feels that the
selection itself, “human one mor-
tally/ immortally i can/ turn im-
mense all times/ because to why",

 

is one ofintrlnsic educational mean-
in .
g Completed in a Week

Clark, who completed the relief
in one week in order to have it
ready for the Center‘s opening,
originally working from the rough
preliminary drawing he had sub-
mitted to the Art Coordinating Corn-
mittee, didn't feel he was hindered
by the time element, rather, it may
have aided him.

He said he “really started out to
make just a relief," but through the
use of various objects the relief
“involved itself in becoming aroom
in itself."

Clark composed the relief of a
collage made mostly from “found
objects" after first building a base
of plywood which be fastened to
furrlng strips on the wall. He began
working roughly from his sketch
and doing the “drawing” on the
wall with old barn planking.

General DoaIan

After setting up the general de-
sign he worked by intuition, adding
objects according to textural con-
trast, etc.

At a glance the relief contains
such objects as an old door, old
table legs, a television set, a back
of a chair, etc. After Clark had
constructed the relief he sprayed
it white, and later worked with
stain to emphasize various tex-
tures.

Clark stated that on the whole
he is “very happy with it." He
added that “although l'm sure there
are some people who will object
to it, there are those who would
object to a portrait in Lincoln.”

Staff Works 18. Hour Days
For Campus - Center Opening"

With the opening of the new Cam-
pus Center this week, many students
may wonder exactly how much ofthe

‘ center is finished, and wonder when

these unfinished portions will be
completed. ,

Neil Brown, who as Director of
Student Affairs is in charge of all
the facilities contained in the Cam-
pus Center, explained that since the
Center was turned over to the Uni-
versity System three weeks ago,
he and his staff have been working
18 hour days in order to get the
Center ready in time for its open-
ing' Basement Lovol

At present the basement ﬂoor has
not been turned over to the Univer-
sity, and Brown explained that the
day set for the University acceptance
of all basement area is February 15;
however, Brown is hopeful that most
basement facilities will beavailable
in a matter of four or five weeks.

The basement houses the cafeteria
and snack bar; Brown stated that the
first facility opened willbe the cafe-
teria which will be run onan is hour

basis, and provide. meals Presently

all the equipment for the cafeteria
kitchen has been installed, and all
the furniture for the dining room
has arrived.

in orienting himself to finding the
present attractions of the Center it
is easiest to enter the Center at
the main entrance of the building
which opens onto the interior court
of the podium .

On entering the center from this
entrance the student will find him-
self in a balconied area; reached
by the central staircase and planned
as a small gallery.

Main Desk

The main information desk has
five phones with the numbers 457--
6923 through 457-6927. Tickets for
University events will be obtained
here.

Past the information desk are
the offices of the Student Activities
Staff; Room 137 houses all Student
Activities advisors, and Room 128
houses Brown’s offices as well as
that of Joseph Silvey, Assistant
Director of Student Affairs, and
Mrs. Barbara Burkhart Garcia.

On the second floor, directly above
the main entrance is the main ball-
room which Brown hopes will be a
very ﬂexible and frequently used
meeting place. The Ballroom fea-

. tures parqueted oak floors, recessed

colored lighting, and a new grand
piano and organ.
I Fireplace Lounge

To the right is the fireplace
lounge, and adjoining tilts is the As-
sembly Hall which features a wall
mural of mixed media designed by
the University’s A. William Clark.

0n the third floor the student will
find the music department which
will probably be housed here until
Spring ’68. It is this floor which
is designed primarily for organi-
zations, however, until the space
occupied by the music department
is made available only a few student
organizations will have their centers
here.

The new office for the Student
Association is in 361, and the new
office of the Albany Student Press
is located in 364.

Regarding hours, Brown said at
first the Center will be open weekly
from 7 am. to 12 midnight; it will
be open later on weekends; hopefully
until three o'clock, when appropriate
schedules can be worked out.

The fourth concert of the music

0. faculty series will be presented in

Page Hall on Tuesday, Feb. 21, at
8:15 p.m. The soloists will he \Vii-
liam Hudson, clarinet, and James
Morris, trumpet, with Findlay Cock-
rell, piano, and guest artist Arthur
Catricai, cello.

The program will include the
Beethoven Trio in Db major, opus
11; Brahms Sonata No. 2 in lib
major, opus 120, for clarinet and
piano; Telemann Concerto in D ma-
jor for trumpet,- Sonata for trumpet
and piano by liaisey Stevens, and
Sinfonia for piano, clarinet, trumpet
and cello by Alfred Casella.

Hudson was formerly first clar-
Ihetist of the Connecticut Symphony,
the New Haven Symphony, and for
two years, he toured Europe as first
clarinetlst with the U. S. Army
Symphony Orchestra. He joined the
faculty here in 1063andis conductor
0f the University Symphony Orches-
tra and University Concert Band.

Morris who recently completed
his doctorate at the University of
Southern California has performed
as a professional trumpet player
with numerous Hchestr‘as in the

before the panel of judges and were
seen in three different outfits. One
was school clothes, the other ap-
propriate date dress and the last
was formal attire (long gown or
regular length.)

Two finalists were picked from
the eight. 'i‘hree photographs of each
girl were sentto Glamour Magazine,
along with the entry form.

Lynn remembers that the pro-
ceedings were “veryhectic.” Semi-
finals were held on a Sunday and the
two finalists were chosen the fol-
lowing Wednesday.

Formerly Lynn wanted to be a
French teacher. Sheis stilla French
major, however, she would now like
a job with an airline, preferably a
French airline, as a stewardess or
a related job requiring that she
travel.

Aside from modeling summer
clothes in her home town of New
Rochelle, she has had no previous
fashion experience.

The contest last year was held at
Bruba‘cher with Miss Burkhart, Miss
Torres, two male fresh and three
other students acting as judges.

This year the contest will be held
at the newly opened Campus Center
on Sunday, February 19.

Four Soloist Are Featured
In Next Faculty Concert

Angeies l’hiiharmmiir and the San
Francisco Ballet and Opera orches-
trns. in addition to his teaching
duties at the University, Dr. Mor-
ris ls solo trumpet with the Albany
Symphony Orchestra.

Although representative of all
earlier, less complex style, the Trio
in Db major, opus ll, of iieethoven
contains traces ofinncvailve devices
with which Beethoven was to become
identified.

The two Clarinet Sonatas, opus
120, were written during the last
years of Brahms’ life, and they
represent his most mature style.
Throughout, the music gives the
piano powerful passages in which it
expresses heroic ideas, demanding
from the performer the highest ex-
pressiveness.

Although Telemann has not been
accorded the wide popular acclaim
of two ofhis contemporaries, Handel
and Bach, he enjoyed considerable
fame during his lifetime. The Con-
certo is D major for trumpet is
typical not only of ’I‘eiemann’s
lyrical qualities but also ofhis abil-
ity to write characteristically for

Greek Week To Establish Rupport-
Between Greeks,

by Sue Archey

Greek Week, Feb. 7-11, is more
than just a series of social events
sponsored by the Greek groups on
campus. Nor is this event meant for
only the Greeks. It is an effort on
the part of the Greeks to improve
communication between themselves
and the other segments of the Uni-
versity community, the indepemient
students and the faculty and admin-
istration.

Lynn Hewitt, of Psi Gamma, and
Debby Walton, of Chi Sigma Theta,
co-chairmen of Greek Week,
summed up the purposes of these
events in this way, "We Greeks
want to improve the prestige of the
Greeks on this l-alilpus, to establish
a better rapport with the adminis-
tration, to improve the contact he-
tweeh Greeks and nun-Greeks on
this campus, and to introduce the
Greeks and some aspects of their

We}; .».\~s.m”__

  

To accomplish these goals, the
events have been planned to em-
phasize informal interaction be-
tween the Greeks and other mem-
bers of the University. Each night
this week there were open houses
at the Greek dormitory sections.

Following the Open Houses, on
Tues. and \Ved. evenings, there
were talks by Sorrell Chesln, As-
sociate Dean of Students, and
Lauren Kurz, former Student Am-
bassador. Dean Chesln spoke on
the apparent tack on the part of the
average college student, of involve-
ment with bother other students and
with faculty.

Coming Events

This afternoon the Greek groups
will compete in Olympic Day. The
events will include snowshoe races
3 Iug-of-war, an inter-sorority
football game, and chariot race. A
snow sculpture contest which was
to he held has been cancelled be-
cause the snow is too dry to pack
