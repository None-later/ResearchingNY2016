“Teamwork Highlights. in Streak

{Facing the toughest week of their schedule. the Albany State “TEAM” came
through, in fine style, winning all three contests and extending their w1nning streak
to six games. After defeating Utica College. 102-85. last Tuesday, the Great Danes
also handed setbacks to Oswego State. 77-60, and rugged Ithaca College, 91—82,
on Thursday andSaturday nights at the Hudson Valley Community College Court.

Both games were mon-
uments to the teamwork of

Albany State and concur-

rently to the fine coaching
and regimentation of his
players by Coach Richard
“Doc” Sauers.

State’s victory over Oswego was
spearheaded by senior Mike Bloom
who picked up the scoring slack of
Rich Margison who was held to 11
points. Bloom hit for 21 markers.
Margison, however, did yoeman
service off the back boards for State
with 16.

Scott Price, Albany’s usual big
man under the boards was in early
foul trouble and played less than
half the game, but still managed to
pour 10 points through the hoop.

Turning in a commendable job
Tim Jursak, Price's replacement,
had several key shots and rebounds.
Jim Constantino turned in a fine
job on defense and hit in double
figures,

Ithaca, four times a victor over

State, came to the Hudson Valley
court with a mediocre 7-8 record-but
were favored to edge the much
smaller Danes. “

After trailing early in the first
half, Doc Sauers charges tied the
score and after a see-saw battle,
held the lead, 41-39, at halftime.

Early in the second half the Danes
broke the close contest wide open,
surging ahead by as many as 17
points. .

Leading the way for the Danes
was Rich Margison who poured a
career high of 27 points through
the net. Mike Bloom added 21, Scott
Price had 17 markers as well as
14 rebounds, and Jim Constantino
had 12 points.

Next Friday and Saturday nights
the Albany State cagers will face
Rochester Institute and Buffalo U.
and will return to meet Oneonta
State at home on Wednesday, Feb-
ruary 22.

lnol Action

Final action was taken on the
proposal on Feb. 6, when the Stu-
dent Affairs Council, a standing
committee of the Faculty Senate,
presented the proposal to the Fac-
ulty Senate, and on Feb. 8 when it
was formally accepted by the Uni-
versity Counsel.

The proposal sets up outside visit-
ation limits of 12 noon to 11 p.m.

- each dorm may set their own hours

within these limits if they wish, and

MYSKANIA first became a part
of the University in 1917. Eleven
people were first chosen by the
facility. It was decided the council
would consist of from ten to twelve
members. In 1916, the first editor
of the State College News proposed
‘hai the members of the outgoing

council should “tap” the new mem-
bers as they sat in the audience.
The proposal was adopted.

The first change in selection ofthe
members tpok place in the 1920's
when the students were permitted
to elect two members. Since the
early 20's, the faculty has had no
further say in the selection ofMYS-
KANIA members.

The first purpose of MYSKANIA
was to supervise as well as moti-
vate extra-curricular activities to
act as the student government, and
as a mediary between the faculty
and students, It was also respon.
'sibie for innovating as well as up.
holding the college's traditions.

In 1068 the first MYSKANIA un-
der the new Student Association
Constitution was tapped in a
shortened and simplified ceremony,
Every MYSKANIA since then has
been tapped on Inauguration Day in
February. This year's MYSKANIA
will be tapped on Sunday, March 5,

l’onel To Discuss I
Bunch’sbismissol
At Eye Tonight

George Bunch will be the main
speaker at a Golden Eye presen-
tation tonight at 9:00.

Bunch was recently fired from
his position as a sociologist teach-
er at Junior College of Albany.
Bunch will offer his beliefs on why
he was dismissed.

Bunch feels that his political ac-
tivities motivated the dismissal.
It is commonly suspected that he
was fired as a result of his “prom-
inent activities in Civil Rights in
the Albany area.”

Lewis Froman, President ofRus-
sell Sage College, of which JCA is
a subdivision, said Bunch was dis-
missed as a result of a directhe
from the State Department of Edu-
cation advising Forman that the
college's sociology department
should have a sociologist with bet-
ter credentials than Bunch has.

Richard Evans, chairman of a
new group called the Tri-City Stu-V
dent Alliance, will moderate the
panel which will also include Peter
Larrick, a member of Albany State's
English Department. Last year he
taught at Junior College of Albany.

in addition, a student from the
college will speak on this subject.

The forum will be held at the
Presbyterian Church, 820 Madison
Avenue tonight at 0:00.
