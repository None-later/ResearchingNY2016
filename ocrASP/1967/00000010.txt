Summer Planning Conference 1967, expected to
serve as the primary orientation to the University
for over 2,000 new students. will be highlighted by
the initiation of a full program for transfers and in- .
creased benefits for the student assistants who com-

prise the conference staff.

The’ current expansions
in the program reflect the
steady growth which has
characterized SPC since
its inception in July, 1964.

There will be a general meeting
for all students interested in apply-
ing for positions as conference as-
sistants in the third floor faculty
lounge of the humanities building
on Tuesday, Feb. 21 at 7 p.m.

The first of its kind among col-
legiate orientation systems in the
northeast, the conference has tra-
ditionally focused on incoming
freshmen. A variety of activities,
including academic advisement ses-
sions and recreational and social
events are scheduled.

This year's planning conference
will involve not only '7 three-day
sessions for freshmen, but 5 over-
night programs for transfers. In
contrast to previous years, when
transfers attended brief, half-day
meetings with the focus on ace-
demlc advisement, a full program
will be offered to the 800 students
who are expected.

The Summer Planning Conference
is run jointly by the faculty, ad-
ministration, and students. Sorreli
E. Chesin, Associate Dean of Stu-
dents at the University, is official
coordinator of the Conference. Much
of the responsibility for its suc-
cess, however, is in the hands of
the students who are selected an-
n'ually to be conference assistants.

Keeping pace with other facets of
SPC, the staff this year will be ex-
panded to 12, an increase from 9 in‘
1965 and 11 in the past year. Six

to seven women and five to six men
will be chosen.

Any interested student at the Uni-
versity is eligible to apply for a
position as a conference assistant.
Discussing the qualifications for the
job, which he termed a challenging
experience, Dean Chesin stated that
a candidate should “feel positively
about the University."

While a 2.5 cum is generally used
as a guideline, consideration will be
given to anyone in good academic
standing. Experience in residence
commuting, or both, in government
or other student activities is help-
ful, as well as outside work exper-
ience, which might be relative.

Remuneration for the conference
assistants has been increased by
about 15% and now totals $400. In
addition, assistants receive room
and board during the 8 weeks of tin:
conference. Selection is made on
the'hasis of interviews and recom-
mendations by both professional
planning conference members and
the student staff of the 1966 pro-
gram.

Applications for positions will h‘
available in EC 264, the student af-
fairs office, and should be returner]
no later than March 1. Applicants
will then be summoned for a pre-
liminary interview, after which the
final selection group will he chosen.

Final interviews and recommen-
dations will be followed by the an-
nouncement of the 1967 conference
assistants and alternates prior to
Easter vacation.

Dean Chesin stressed the impor-
tance of the conference assistants
in the program. Previous staffs,
he commented, have been ‘exr'el-
lent,’ contributing to the fantustlr
response that SPC receives Iron.
its attendants.
