Epistle To llippy

Affectionately referred to by many as
“the Great White Elephantin the North,”
Camp Dippikill has been a festering
sore in the side of Student Association
for many years. It was purchased in
1956 with $10,000 of’Student Association
funds, although the Faculty-Student
Association holds the deed. Being unin—
corporated, Student Association cannot
own property.

At present, Dippikill is run by SA-
chartered Camp Board, which consists
of 5 elected faculty members, an FSA
member who has no vote, and 8 student
members who are elected by present
members. A

Although the Camp originally cost
$10,000, Student Association has pumped
over $10,000 more into upkeep. taxes,
repairs, equipment and other expenses
of maintaining the status quo. In addi-
tion, $4 to $6,000 a year has been added
to a fund now totaling over $60,000 to
be used in the future for development.

Despite all of this money, Dippikill
has remained as remote and useless to
the overwhelming majority of students

University.

as it was in 1956. “Roughing it” is
about the only activity feasible with the
present facilities.

What is needed is a fully developed
facility capable of serving the wants and
needs of more than a small group of
students. To do this we need a lodge,
a ski slope, power lines, roads, a dam
for the lake, and facilities for recrea~
tional activities.

With a good amount less money than
Dippikill has, the Office of Student Ac-
tivities has been making steady pro—
gress in building up Camp Mohawk. If
Central Council finds itself incapable
of formulating a» specific plan to de-
velop Dippikill for the eleventh con-
secutive year, perhaps responsibility
could be turned over to Student Ac-
tivities where perhaps something can
be done.

We are tired of seeing $60,000 held
up while SA maintains a desolate for-
est. Richard Jankowski, Chairman of
Camp Board, estimates that $40,000
more is needed so that everything may
be built at once.

We urge SA to find some money,
start building, or get rid of Dippikill
and find a better use for our money.

Where’s MYSKANIA?

Applications are now available for self-nomination
to MYSKANIA, as well as Central Council replace-
ment, LAAC and Class office elections. In previous
years there was little question about the importance
of the MYSKANIA elections. This year, however,

there may be a question.

Last year we wrote editorials about finding a pur—

COMM UNI CA TI 0N8

Blasts Schwartz

To the Editor:

Public opinion is valuable when
the opinion is based on facts and
awareness of situations. However,
when a complete misrepresentation
of facts occurs, the result can be
quite injurious.

In “Over The Counter Intelli-
gence" on Feb. 14, 1967, Mr. Mar-
tin Schwartz appears to believe that
the student government’s achieve-
ments are quite scant. I believe,
however, that he has not consid-
ered the large responsibility and
time spent on changing university
policy to conform to student’s needs.
Mr. Schwartz states that he has
“heard nothing about liquor since
last October" and that the commit-
tee has been "slow." What he has
overlooked is that a policy cannot
merely state that Albany is a wet
campus. A careful resolution must
accompany that concept, The le-
galities of licenses and state laws
must also be upheld. Therefore, a
hasty policy would not be a sound
policy. A detailed siep-by-step plan
has to be worked out,

in reference to the women'shours
proposal for a fantastically long
time, perhaps he is not aware that
not only did LAAC conduct regular
meeting but also held special offi-
cers' meeting with faculty assis.
tance, working strictly on the re-
vision of hours.

After intensive studies and re-
JPt'iloli of the key proposal and a
f. a,ln. curfew proposal, the final
ilulli’)’ was drafted. if a policy is
to he formed, ample time must be

one for students.

Perhaps it appears to the typical
bystander that nothing has been
done. Unfortunately, the bystander
has not taken part in student gov-
ernment or take. the initiative to
comprehend the works of the gov-
ernment. \

A person such as this cannot
pretend to understand policy-mak-
ing. Criticism is easy when the
speaker sees only what he wants
to see.

Judy Osdoby

Schwartz Blasts

To the Editor:

I would like the opportunity to
answer the criticism leveled at my
column and, more important, my
personality in the above letter. Miss
Osdoby can have no knowledge of
the effort or "initiative" taken in
researching the column she speaks
o .

She seems guilty of the same
anti-lniellectualism and lack of var-
islmilitude of which she accuses me'.
No effort was made to determine
the extent of my knowledge before
an absolute statement of my ignor-
ance was made.

Although the University Council
approved the "wet campus” prin-
ciple on October 28, 1966, a com-
mittee did not begin to mean to
consider policy until December '7.
1966. The concept that the com-
mittee is working with is to present
at once an all-encompassing policy
to hopefully cover all aspects
the issue.

it is feasible, however, that a
proposal allowing perhaps, on-

been passed long ago, and by now
enacted, while the committee con-
tinues to deal with such ideas as a
rathskeller in the Student Center
and the question of liquor in the
living quarters.

Miss Osdoby neglects to mention
in her letter, also, that the sentence
she quotes continues by mentioning
that the committee is moving stead-
ily toward a finished proposal, un-
like many other groups on this
campus.

Miss Osdoby has restricted her
criticism of my treatment of the
women’s hours proposal to my com-
plaint of slowness. She neglests to
comment on my complaint that the
LAAC jumped right into the pro-
posal without bothering to decide
first if they were a representative
group, or finding out exactly what
powers they were given to work
with.

This is the reason that “ample
time“ was needed to formulate a
proposal. I have no complaint with
the time it took to check with the
quad boards and students to find
out what they wanted. My complaint
is that this could have been done
long ago instead of finding out that
they were unrepresentative after
such a long time,

To quote Miss Osdoby: "when a
complete misrepresentation of the
facts occurs, the result can be
quite iniurious...the bystander has
...not taken the initiative to "com-
prehend" what went into the writing
of such o‘colunin.

"Criticism is easy when the
speaker sees only what he wants to
see."

pose for this for this former judicial body. At least
there was some mentionof MYSKANIA. Duringthe past
year it seems that MYSKANIA has been pushed even
further into the background.

There have been few purpose proposaps and little
accomplished by this body this year. Many people have
made good suggestions concerning a role for MYS—
KANIA. One should serve its purpose.

Those people who will be applying for the thirteen
honored seats this year are the last ones who will
have any recollection for their former glory. Next
year’s applicants will have known nothing but con-
fusion surrounding MYSKANIA’s role. In order to
make the election significant and worthwhile, this
position of this group should be made apparent by
the new MYSKANIA.

It is even more important that a purpose be found
this year than last. It is the duty of the current ap—
plicants to determine the future of MYSKANIA. Those
who want to see this long—standing tradition continue
must support its existence.

Last year we were looking for a purpose for MYS—
KANIA. This year we’re looking for MYSKANIA.

Fall Primer 'Momentarily Diverting’
Poetry Termed ‘More Worth-y’Than Prose

Prefaces are notoriously misleading,

what follows,

by Darlene Downing

whether one expects them to be a digest of
the rules for understanding it, or whatever,

and it is the unusual pub-

qj-,lication which follows the tenor established in the preface. The obvious exception.
however, 18 the fall 1966 Primer. The preface is a mass of non sequiture, gener-
alities, and tritenesses; it is not, however, misleading,



be - said of the body of the

Probably the first thing
the reader notices is the
name James F. Eddy. This
is scarcely remarkable.
for Mr. Eddy is not only
the editor, he has also un-
dertaken to be the chief
contributor.

Editing

Apparently Mr. Eddy has never
heard of what is known as profes—
sionalism in editing, or has chosen
to ignore it; at any rate, the situa-
tion would not be quite so deplor-
able had he chosen to write in any
vein other than “pop.” As it is,
most of his selections are vapid
and pointless.

Even in those (few?) selections
which were not written by him,
Mr, Eddy’s hand is visible in the
type of material selected. A case
in point is "AU144," by Ellen C.
Rogers. The piece is momentarily
diverting, but that is about the most
that can be said for it.

Lawrence Epstein has fallen into
the same trap, although we wonder
if in his case it isn’t simply poor
representation. In any event, both
"The Helper" and "The Last Judg-
ment" descend so far into their own
petals that they become incompre-
hensible, if not downright bad.

Poetry Section
On the whole, the poetry section
was a great deal more worthy than
the prose offerings. The notable ex-
ceptions are Ted G. Nash's “To

(l Harry from Stanley," and Maureen

Travers’ “Tile Creation‘." Mr.Nash
captures beautifully the feelings at
the end of a friendship, while Miss
Travers' infallible sense of the
ironic produces a finely honed satire
on man.

As for the drama selection pre-
sented, the less said the better.
Gross reproduces all the opacity
Of Albee with none of his depth.

Mr. Nash again comes to the fore
with his "Song of a Sleepy Student.”
Unlike most of the selections in

,l; the volume, his associations are

meaningful, not only to him, but

 

 

publication.
also to the reader.

Authenticity
While not one of the best, it can-
not be denied that Lou Strong’s
reminiscences on New York, ‘his’
city, have an uiideniable‘authentlcity
and a real evocaiory power.

Highest laurels - in any form -
must go to Ev Warren and William
Noihdurft. “The Silent Night’s” im-
agery, especially in the last few
lines, is exquisite, while “Dawn
Through a Smoky Window" has a
pervading suggestion of T. S. Eliot
throughout.

Probably the most unusual selec-
tion for an anthology which obviously
tries to be so pretentious and self-
iniportani is the delightful contribu-
tion by Anonymous entitled “Attempt
at Regular Verse by a Student of
Creative Writing,"

Music Council Sees
Artist Selection
As Main Purpose

by Louise Myers

The selection and sponsoring of
guest artist performers for musi-
cal concerts is the main purpose
of the Music Council. In its selec-
tion of artists, the Council attempts
to achieve variety in its programs
on many levels, such as the type
of instruments played, the period
of music performed, and the size
of the group.

The role of the Music Council,
for several reasons, is seen as one
of ever-increasing expansion. Be-
cause this ls an age of “cultural
explosion," the performing arts to-
day are receiving more attention
than ever before.

Within technical and financial
limits, Music Council selects the
most representative and outstand-
ing artists available. As the Uni-
versity expands the Muaic Council
feels an increasing responsibility
to present nationally and interna-
tionally known artists who present
the many diverse expressions of
musical thought.

Will) the addition of a music ma-
jor to the undergraduate curricu-
lum, comes ll need for the presen-
tation of performances that aspire
to perfection, and that presentation
ideally should be “live” and not
confined to the stereo world of
discoiheque.

By increasing its concert and
lecture series in the future, Music
Council hopes to augment the stu-
dent's realm of musical background
and experiences,

Hopefully, the development of Mn-
sic Council will parallel the recent
development in arts toward the total
effect of music, dance, film, andthe

We do not mean to suggesr that
there is nothing to commend in the
Fall 1966 Primer, for such is not
the case. What is true is that under
no set of standards can the current
issue measure up to past publica-

tion be attributable to its editor.
Unfortunately, most readers, like
Mr. Eddy, "are not amused."

Cunningham, and Wilhelm Kluver many comments

were offered? They ranged

from “fascinating perfor-

mance” and “very informative discussion" to “half
boring” and “totally confused and unrelated.”

Several interesting ideas
were presented during the
performance which demon-
strated the changes that
are going on in the world
of the performing arts.

Discuss 'Vuriotlon 5'

In one discussionJohn Cage, com-
poser, Merce Cunningham, choreo-
grapher and Wilhelm'Kluver, elec-
tronic technician explained the con-
struction of their piece 'Variation 5'.
It is a contemporary innovation
which makes full use of the element
of chance.

Dancers dance through electronic
beams, setting off musical tapes
for a certain length of time. Thus,
the music is related to the dance
through the element of chance. The
tapes set off in this way are re-
cordings made during a poker game
of 48 hours of the dripping of faulty
plumbing.

lndictingullhable Explanation

Among the varied opinions offered
about the performance were those
concerning Robert Creeley. After
listening to him mumble an almost
indistinguishable explanation of the
relation of form to poetry, three
people left, later commenting that
they did not think much ofhis views.
All three were campus poets them-
selves.

His iheory seemed to center_ on
an, idea central in the festival, that
art is a process and not an object.
He further explains that the sense
of form, related to the view of

‘Blow Up’ Magnificent

Seen As Film Classic

by Doug Ruthgeb

The trouble with Michaelangelo Antonioni’s first
English—language film, “Blow Up,” is that there is
entirely too much to say about it, especially ina
column as abbreviated as this one. There is just too
much good, solid, meaningful and beautiful stuff in
this film, which makes it at once a thrill anda
nightmare for the critic confined to a'few columns

in a newspaper.

I will therefore not even
attempt. to cover all that
this marvelous film holds
for the viewer, but simply
say all I can to convince
him to see it.

The basic story concerns a young
fashion photographer in today's Lon-
don, a city symbolic as any of the
modern world. The photographer
(played superbly bynewcomer David
liemmings) lives a daya-to-day ex-
istence, finding pleasure where he
may, his whole life revolving about
his work.

Suriounued, or better, engulfed
in a world of frivolous, aimless
people leading empty and meaning-
less lives, he finds himself one of
them and doesn’t mind it a bit. At
least, he doesn’t know that he minds

...
so

Then one morning, while photo-
graphing a pair of lovers in a quiet
park, a fragment of meaning is sud-l
denly, by accident, injected into his
life, and he suddenly finds himself
“involved.”

For, when he arrives back at his
studio and develops the film, he
discovers that all the while his
camera was clicking away the in-
nocent scene, it was also record-
ing a murder,

Slowly, meticulously, driven by
his curiosity (if not his humanity),
he tries to fit the pieces together,
blowing up each picture, then blow-
ing up each blowup, until he has the
entire sequence of events before
him, like some grotesque art gal-
lery.

The question now is, should he
pursue the matter? Should he al-
low himself to become involved,
should he conduct a search for

irmh-_tn.fimi fnr__himsol£.nrhn,mns Lf nfnmnluiputu..nni.lm...

 

killed, who was the killer, and the
why of it all? Should he look for
meaning or, like the society around
him, drop the matter and admit that
nothing, even death, has any mean-
ing?

But the real. answer to "Blow-
Up" is not to be found through.plot
alone. If anything, the: plot for An-
tonioni is the meanest and least
significant component, next to char.
acterization.

The true meaning of the film is
to be found in the total viewing ex-
perience--the whole mood and at-
mosphere, even the most seemingly
inconsequential acts of the charac-
ters and movements of the camera.

ONLY A SMALL PORTION of the

poetry as an object, will appeal to
"minds obsessed by convention."
Dance ‘Abctrectlon'

Merce Cunningham, in hisdiaeue-
sion, explained that the sophistica-
tion in dance will be a mature lux-
iaposiiioning of elements, not an
"abstraction" of man’s movement.
Although a gesture may not have
a conventional interpretation it is
false to immediately label it “ab-
stract” because actually the word
"abstract" has little meaning in
terms of movement.

Jack Tworkov commented that
through the medium the message
evolves. He feels therefore that
medium and message are inex-
tricably one.

Art Display (lentils
lnteresi'u textures,

contrasting Colors

by Harvey Violins

The second floor of the Campus
Center has a student art show that'
displays several interesting tex-
tured works in addition to the paint-
ings. Also on display are a number
of pieces of pottery. and colleges.

One artist has taken several dif-
ferent size pieces ofcork and placed
them within a frame. The effect re-
sembles a stone wall, but the various
shades and shapes create a senseof
depth and forms unusual patterns.

Another unusual texture appears
to be made up of small sticks of
dark wood put together to form
patterns and the whole thing is cov-
ered with a dust-like material, then
covered with a hard paint. The ef-
fect is a rough white-on-biack tex-
ure.

An exceptionally fine sketch hangs
on the east wall of the exhibit. It is
a face done in a silver-gray on a
black background. The face is made
up of separate small patches ofgray
while the spaces in between form the
shadows and character of the face.
There is a haunting quality of dark-
ness about it.

The paintings on exhibit are
mostly figures done in bright and
sharply contrasting colors. They
are generally figures ofwomendone
impressionistically, with large
bodies and plain faces. The ab-
stracts in the show are mostly
bright in color with one color blend-
ing into another, forming several
high and low spots on the canvas.

The abstracts generally maintaln
their mood with the various colors
and a projected essence is evident.
