eight previous putings.

The true test of the cagers will be in how they fare
in these two games. We feel that the success of the
season, no matter how the team does in its other re—
maining games, will lie in how they perform in these
back-to-back contests against highly rated opponents
away from the confines of a home court and somewhat

of a home crowd.

If the Sauers ‘five’ produce two victories, which is
highly unlikely, then we can justly say that the sea-
son will be one of the most rewarding and gratifying
that the Albany mentor has had in 12 seasons that he

V has been head coaéh. On the other hand, if the squad
drops both, we cannot term the season a success,
even though the Danes will finish the year over .500.
We will be traveling with the squad and praying along
with it that itwill return home with at least one victory

to its credit.

But there is one thing that the hoopsters can look
forward too. And that is playing before a crowd. It IS
a real shame that virtually only the teams, coaches,
trainers, reporters, and ushers are the only ones
who are in attendance at the spacious Hudson Valley
Community College gymnasium where the Danes play

their home games.

We realize that it is an inconvenience for many to
take the time and effort to attend a basketball game,
seven miles away. But in the last five contests,
Sauer’s crew has played exceptionally well, winning
every game easily. The least we could do is to try
to make it a point to attend one of the three remain-
ing'home games and show some respect for a team
that plays hard-nosed precision basketball. with the
final score much more often than not in itslfavor.

.Two of these games promise to be dillys. The first
will be the grudge game against Siena, a week from
tomorrow, at 8:30 at the Washington Ave. Armory. The
cagers will be out to seek revenge againsta team that
defeated them in the finals of the Capital City Tourney.
The other will be a return engagement with UB on
March 4 at the LaSalle Institute in Troy. It would be
a fine compliment to a fine team if we could insure
capacity crowds to give added incentive to a team
that is capable of playing some of the best basketball

Art Recesso:

by Hank Rabinowit!

Art Recesso has had an
outstanding record as a
wrestler at Gloversville
High School, Cobleskill
Tech., and presently as the
captain of this year’s‘
wrestling team.

Art, who stands 5’ IO" competes.
in the 167 pound class. in his senior
year at Cobleskill A 81 T he com-
.plled a 12-0 slate, with seven of
those victories coming via pins.

Last season, in his first year of
varsity competition at Albany he
finished with an 8-2-1 recompile-
tably, he scored the most points,
and earned the MVP award. This
year he is well on the way to equal-
'ing tin: number oi successes he
achieved during the past campaign.

Wrestling has not been the only
sport in ch Art has participated.
While in igh school he was amem-'
bar of the football and track teams,
In addition, he has played amateur
football, and has represented his

.rMCA in boxing. '

Many people feel that wrestling
is solely an individual's sport. liow-‘
~vor, as Art explained, the idea of
no team is very much a part of
his sport. For example, the coach

that most of his moves were taught

"Previously, I learned many oi

his strength, his style has become

Albany Faces Hobart,

Seeks Winning Season

by Dunc Nixon

The Albany State grap—
plers will be in action to-
morrow at 3 p.m. when
they will host the'Hobart
statesmen. Hobart will
bring their most success—
ful team ever.

The statesmen will be out to
avenge last years 24-15 loss to
the Great Danes in Geneva. How-
ever, their line-up may be some-
what depleted, in that two of their
top wrestlers Jim Polus and Hunt
llendrickson have suffered injuries
in recent matches and both must
be considered doubtful.

Despite these injuries the Hobart
squad has parieyed a solid nucleus
of returning veterans with a "bum-

per crop" of sophomores, to pro-
duce their winningest season ever.
Coach Garcia's Great Danes, who
lead the Hobart series by a 5-1-1
count, were 2-3-1 in dual meets at
the time of this writing.

The Albany matmen started the
season off with a bang by register-
ing a decisive victory in the Quad-
rangular tourney, taking '7 of I]
first places. They opened their reg-
ular season though against a rough
Fairleigh Dickenson team and the
loss of Roger Gorham, the prom-
ising 177 pounder, to a leg injury
was more than the Great Danes
could compensate for.

After the Christmas lay-off, the
Danes traveled to Oneonta and once
again ran into stiff competition,
losing 20-13. Potsdam was next
and the grapplers toughened to de-
molish them by a 24-8 count. '

«Fear Factor

A panel of four discussed the
possibilities of political implica-
tions in the recent dismissal of
George Bunch, former instructor of
sociology, from the Albany Junior
College, at Friday night's Golden
Eye.

     
      
   
   

  
   
 

Discussion also centered around
the possibilities of a “climative
fear" existing in the Tri-Cities Area
. in regard to freedom of expression,

. especially by administrations fear-

ing student involvement in politics.

A general consensus of the panel

in opinion made up of Bunch, two area

professors, and a JCA co-ed, indi

cated that they felt such a fear ex-
isted, although not totally.

Pickcts At JCA, Sage
Protest Bunch Ouster

The demonstrations called for
last Friday by the Tri-City Student
Alliance took place as scheduled.

Approximately twenty-five students
plcketed for some time at the Junior
College of Albany and the same
number marched in front of the
home of Russell Sage President
Lewis Froman in Troy.

Picketers carried signs read-
ing "Bring Back Bunch," "I Be-
lieve in Academic Freedom,” and
"Keep Albany Politics Off the Col-
lege Campus." The picketing in
Troy lasted from noon to threep.m.
with a coffee break at about two
o'clock.

Panel Discusses Bunch,"

In Issue

Bunch felt this fear was preva-
lent in all’levels, but that it is "all
pervasive" among administrations.
He felt it was this fear which led
tauntsdismlssal, which he argues
is than direct antithesis of the
principle of academic freedom.

The panel also felt that this fear
was a factor in the dismissal. Panel
member Peter Larrick, an instruc-
tor of English at the University, felt
that it was "evident" that this was
a factor, because Bunch had involved
students in controversy and urged
them repeatedly to action; this cre-
ated in wave of discomfort among
the administration, and led to the
decision that JCA would be better
without Bunch.

 

A large group of Russell Sage
girls witnessed the demonstration
from across the street but did not
participate. At one point, however,
the teacher of freshman history
class invited Richard Evans, one
of the picketers, to speak about the
issues in front of her class.

Evans told the ASP that he felt
this opportunity was valuable “even
though the teacher and some of the
class plainly disagreed with me.
After all the purpose of our action
was the promotion of academic free~
dom on the campus and the direct
confrontation of opposing ideas is
a essential ingredient of such free-
dom."

Evans also said that there seemed
to be widespread misunderstanding
of the what the pickets were saying
and that many Sage students re-
sented the ASP editorial of last
week. “They kept repeating that
the dismissal was legal," he said,
and seemed to think that settled
the issue.

Moral Issue

“From our point of view," he
went on, “it was a moral rather
than a legal issue, and we were
concerned with the effect that
Bunch’s dismissal would have on
other non-conformists at Sage."

Evans also said that some of the
girls seemed sympathetic but that
none of them joined the picket-
line at Sage. Meanwhile, the dem-
onstration at the Junior College was
attracting considerably less atten-
tion.

Since it was farther from the
center of campus life than its
counterpart in Troy, fewer students
come to watch it. Late in the after-
noon some of the pickets In Albany
left for Troy to reinforce what was
left of the demonstration there.

In evaluationg the demonstrations
later, Evans said that he consid-
ered it a real achievement to unite
students throughout the area in a
cooperative effort. He also felt that

progress had been made in stimu-
lating debate on the Russell Sage
and J.C.A. campuses.

lmpact Bluntod
"Unfortunately," he stated, "our

impact was blunted by a number of
more or less peripheral issues, such
as the firing of Robert Arey, which
kept creeping into the public dis-
cussions of our position,"

in its first meeting, Saturday, Feb.
18, considered questions of juris-
dictional rulings in the cases which
will come before it for action.

Cases originating in the Quad
Judicial Board, rather than in Hall
Court (original Jurisdiction) were
generally described. Reports in-
volving damage done to Colonial
Quad property are to be handled
directly by the Judicial Board.

Anything that occurs involving
two people from different dorms on
the Colonial Quad, occurring on the
Quad will go directly to the Judicial
Board.

Cases concerning residents of the
Colonial Quad and another Quad, or
infractions on property other than
the Colonial Quad will be handled by
Living Area Affairs, unless referred
to the Quad Judicial Board.

Appeals may be made by any real.
dent of any hall. They are to be
written within two weeks after the
original decision is given. They are
to include the reason for appeal.

The Colonial Quad Judicial Board
may refuse to accept any case if
it feels the decision of the lower
court (hall court) is valid. If this
happens the appeal may not go to
a higher court.

The Judiciary also holds the power
of judicial review and may declare
