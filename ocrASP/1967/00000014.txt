Last week we printed an editorial
questioning. whether, 91: not, academic
freedom was denied to several instruc-
tors, including George Bunch, who were
fired from the Junior College of Albany,
a division of Russell Sage College.

Included in that editorial was an appeal
to Irene Wood. the Russell Sage chapter
president of the AmericanAssociationof
University Professors. asking her to
"change her mind and decide to bringup
this matter at her next meeting.”

Thursday we received a phone call
from Wood, notifying us that she had
scheduled a meeting for Tuesday. While
on the phone she took the opportunity to
question our standards, responsibility,
intelligence. maturity, and ability to
mind our own business.

She also took the opportunity to call
Bunch an unqualified“liar." andto insist
that every one of our facts without ex-
ception was "untrue." In addition, she
stated that she was holding the AAUP
meeting simply to satisfy Bunch’s for-
mal complaint although she considered
the whole affair as a “joke.” Everyone
on the Sage AAUP considered the affair
perfectly beyond reprehension: they had
prejudged the situation.

We asked Wood a few questions to
check her knowledge of the issue. She
was unaware that faculty at the Junior
College have written agreement as to
their employment for the academic year.
She also had no knowledge of President
froman's statement that he had a writ-

en communicative from the Department
of Education. Her main complaint with the

ASP, repeated at least 8 times, was that

anything that Froman or Sage does is

none of our “blankety-blank business.”

Notonly did she deny that a student

from any school or a facultylmember at"
'anOther University ‘has’thev right 'to be

concerned over the possible infringe-

ment of the academic freedom of other

faculty, but she defended Froman’s right
to fire someone if he doesn’t like “the

way he combs his hair."

Wood stated further that the firing of

a faculty member for having'his hair
out of place or for trying to assert his
right to academic freedom was"legally.
morally. and ethically correct.”

The opportunity was not lost to insult
our intelligence. Anyone' who canbelieve
Bunch. Ayres and Delonas. the other fired
instructors, and the New York State De-
partment of Education in the face of a
total absence of refuting facts and a
refusal by Russell Sage to attemptto dis-
pute the issue. must be an “idiot,” and
“stupid.” according to Wood.

We fail to be concerned over a com—
plaint of our inaccuracy by a woman who
not only could not present any logical
or factual argument to refute our facts
or opinions beyond “it is none of
(our)... blankety-blank business,” but
who admits to having prejudged an issue
about which she has serious deficiencies
in her comprehension. ,

We must agree with Isadore Traschem.
Professor of Literature at R.P.I.. who
says that “to think as Mrs. Wood does
is to miss the whole point of being in
this profession."

 

Building Better Bridge

ship, both South and East mad effec-
tive falsecards which fooled each
other. East’s third hand bid of one
heart was made for lead-directing
purposes, in case North-South
bought the contract.

The opening lead of the nine of
hearts was won by East’s ten, and
then he shifted to the diamond six.
West’s king won, and he returned
his other diamond in the nine, ten,
and ace. South exited with his last
diamond, and East won as West
discarded the eight of clubs.

Essl led the club six, and South
falsecarded with the queen and west
won the ace. He led his last heart,
and after East won his jack and the
ace, this was the position:

The art of false carding is a deb: J a a l 3 0
lcste one which not many players '
understand. The majority of bridge
players will false card indiscrim-
inately. and usually only succeed in
deceiving their partner.

cent trials to determine the Ameri- "-
can team for the World's Chemsien- .. . 3

The contract is already beaten,
and the only thing left is to see if
South is down one or two. The king
of clubs lead will obviously put the
contract down two, but East had
been fooled by South's club queen
earlier, and led the queen of hearts.

South discarded his last club as
West ruffed. West led the ten of
clubs and North played low and East
had his chance for revenge as he
went up with the king to create the
impression that it was the only one
he had. South ruffed isnd counted
East for his known four hearts, and
five diamonds, as well as his “sup-
posed" two clubs, which left him
two spades.

He then played to drop the five
outstanding spades, and led to the
queen, then back to his king, but
had to lose a spade trick when it
was revealed that west had started
with five of them.

Players who falsecsrd automati-
cally soon get a reputation for doing
so, and they are never believed.
Therefore, pick the right spots for
your deceptive play, and your op.
ponents will be forced to respect
you. Above all, try to be a reliable
partner and a deceptive opponent.

"f  " ii‘vtrlllt Steamer Infilligence

by MonieSchwerts

Simply with an advertisement in
the current issue promising scon-
troversial lead article next month, .V
Ramparts Magazine has exploded a.

bomb that has had its effects felt “campaign-cups today to criticize .

from coast to coast.

1 am speaking, of course, of the
revelation that the Central intel-
ligence Agency (CIA) gave amounts
approximating $200,000 ayear since
1952 to the National Student Asso-
ciation (NSA).

Assuming Ramparts facts are
correct and that some students have
been used to gather information
about student leaders in other coun-
tries, these students have performed
a patriotic act. in allowing our gov-
ernment to keep pace with current
developments in the "cold war,"
and thus perhaps helping our gov-
ernment to formulate its policy.

Based on current information,

 

It is interesting thatvit has only
been ten years orbso since the
McCarthy era of fanatical opposition
against. anything antieArnerican, i.e.
Communism. How {we can see
anotherzin'stence of the readiness

anything American.

There {was absolutely nothihg
wron‘g in the CIA’s motives. The only
complaint might be that the money
should have been given "over the
counter.”

I, for one, willbeanxiously await-
ing a full view of how Ramparts
will be overworking this issue. This
magazine has degenerated from an
unread repudsble Catholic monthly
to a widely read sensationalist mid-
dle ‘class version of'the National
Enquirerer. it seems like too ob-
vious ,a case of strawvclutching in
search of sensationalism to take to
beating a dead horse. After all,NSA
stopped taking money from the CIA
some time ago.

COMMUNICA TIONS

Review Criticized

To the Editors:

Trying to maintain some degree
of sophistication and intelligence in
attempting to react to the recent
ASP review of Primer 1966-67 is
comparable to trying to wallow in
stagnant water without inhaling the
fumes.

if the tone of this letter is some-
what cryptic, brutal and juvenile,
then it is because the fumes of that
review have been inhaled.

The personal attack on the editor
is unjustifiable, irrational and
totally in keeping with the review
as a whole--inane. Could one of the
reasons that Mr. Eddy's name ap-
pears frequently in this Primer be
the same reason for so' much of his
work having appeared in last se-
mester's Primer (l.e. quality) and
for his work having been selected
by a committee from the English
department to receive the Loven-
helm Award, 1966 (Le. quality)?

Because this letter will be mis-
construed and misunderstood as
was Primer, I, feel it necessary to
state that this is neither an "I love
Primer, 1900-67 letter" nor an
"I love James F. Eddy letter.” 1
love neither.

in fact, i did not find Primer
"amusing" or even in good taste

(witness Primer, Spring 1966) or
lack thereof (witness review of
Primer, Spring‘1966‘) and while I

respect and‘adniire Mr. Eddy for
what I feel to be the excellence of
his writing and the courage to edit
a magazine with controversial over-
tones (something ! lacked), I do not
make a habit of flag-waving.

But, (neither do i feel that a per-
sonal attackshould be made on an

individual under the guise of a,

"review" which is neither thorough
nor even semi-professional and
which lacks both the opacity and
depth of a Shirley Temple movie.

l"sincereiy believe that both Mr.
Eddy and Primer deserve another

review. Whether or not the issue.

appeals to one's particular taste, it
certainly warrants more than the
flip and cross collection of words
which allowed one "reviewer".

whose name does not appear in the,

dlrectory--anonymity could be the
only justifable part of the review)
to get off, as it were, rather easily.

It is obvious that the reviewer
could easily be attacked on many
of the same grounds that were used
to "substantiate" the attack on Mr.
Eddy, but unfortunately self-control
and wit would be necessary to do
this effectively and, at this junc-
ture, I have neither. Suffice to say,
I am not amused, period.
