On Friday night, Albany held a
slim 2 point lead at the half, 40-38.
Bloom was mainly for the margin
as he hit on 7 of 9 field goal at-
tempts and one free throw for 15
points.

In the second half, the hoopsters
quickly stretched their lead to 15
points with Bloom again leading the
way. With 14 minutes remaining in
the game, RIT's Tigers started to
press and within 6 minutes the lead
was cut down to one. But baskets by
Lonnie Morrison, Mary O'Donnell,
and Bloom finally put the game out
of reach.

was defeated in both its games. The

scores of the games were 39-8 and 3

In the first game there was out-
standing playing by Pat Carney, who
scored 6 of the 8 points. In the sec-
ond game the playing of Karen Mil-

standing. Karen scored 6 points and
Judy scored _5.

The efforts of these girls, as well
as the rest of the team, were over-

ALBANY, NEW YORK

Committee formed
In End Vietnam liar
lo fleet lga'n

._ The Student-Faculty
'Committee to end the War
in Vietnam will holds its
second meeting today at
1:25 pm. in Social Sci-

ences 131.

The main business of the meeting
will be to organize various commit-
tees and begin work on the first-
edition of the Committee’s news.-
letter which will be distributed Mon-
day, February 27 at various loca-
tions on campus.

The purpose of the newsletter is
‘0 enlighten the student body as to

hat is happening in Vietnam. it
will include a synopsis of articles
that have appeared in newspapers,
magazines, etc. Also it will contain
articles by members of the com-
mittee.

First Meeting

The first meeting of. the Commit-
tee was held last Friday. Dr. Leroy
Pelton of the Psychology Depart-
ment organized the anti-war body
and presided over the first meeting.

Approximately 60 students and
faculty members heard Pelton de-
scribe what he thought the purposes
of the Committee should be.

ti) He said that he hoped the Com-
mittee would stimulate discussion
on campus especially towards world
affairs. lie felt that discussion of
world affairs on campus last se-
mester was virtually non-existent
as compared to other campuses.

The Committee, he said, should
gather what information there is
about the war in Vietnam and dis-
seminate it on campus and in the
neighboring Albany area. After al-
lowing people to examine the pros
and cons of United States policy,
the Committee should try to con-

..Jvince people to its viewpoint.
Effectiveness of Committee

Pelton felt optimistic about the
Committee’s effectiveness as he
pointed to the mobilization by many
groups in recent weeks to end the
bombing of North Vietnam. He ex-
plained how he felt this movement
was changing the opinions of some
important politicians.

The Committee chose five mem-
bers to head its coordinating com-
mittee which will act as the govern-
ing body of the group. The members
of this committee are David Chllds,
llarold Lynne, William Leue, Peter

twonak, and Mr. Hurry Stuley of
the English Department.

The coordinating committee hopes
to attract ‘lllellthI‘S interested in

ROUIDING OUT PLANS for the televisotion of the Mental
Health Telethon March 10-11, are co-chairmen Jeff Mishkin
and John Fotio.

Preparations For Telethon
Near A Bright Completion

by Ken Bernstein

All but the last-minute details
have beencompleted for the Mental
Health Telethon which will be pro-
duced in two weeks. Almost all the
talent has been rounded up, and ar-
rangements for televising the talent
are set.

The communications department
of the University will provide the
equipment for televised coverage
within the student center. Extra
television sets will be placed in the
various lounges throughout the cen-
ter. In addition, there is room for
800 to watch the telethon live in
the ballroom.

Executive Committee

The executive committee of the
Telethon, Jeff Mlshkin, Ed Kramer,
William Cleveland, Ray Clanfrlnl,
John Fotia, Dr. Paul Bruce Petlt,
'Dr. Clifton Thorne and Neil Drown
found that the cost of transmitting
to the dorms was prohibitive and
abandoned the idea.

The cafeteria of the Student Cen-
ter will be at least partially opened
for the telethon, and will serve re-
freshments.

The key to the success of the
telethon is cooperation, according
to Mishkin, the co-chalrman, and
Kramer, the publicity director. The
committee has received excellent
support and cooperation wherever
it has asked.

'I‘horne has agreed to suspend all
women’s hours the night of the tele-
thon, with the purchase of a ticket.

Address by Collins

President Collins will open the
telethon with an address. Mr. Find-
ley Coukrell and Mr. Brown will
perform during the course of the
telethon, as will the Statesman.
I.F.C. has gone so far as to change
the date of bid distribution so it
would not conflict with the telethon.

in the end, however, the real suc-
cess of the telethon will depend on
the reaction of the student body.
Tickets for the production are $1.50
with student tax, $2.00 without it.
Contributions can also be made
once inside the student center.

The executive committee is up-
timistic about the chances for suc-
cess, if there is student support.

Mishkin said: “Ten people have“

carried this for seven months, but
we can’t sit in the audience and
applaud. We need the student sup-
port.

Kramer saw the telethon as a
unique chance for the University to
make a name for itself. He expects
good news coverage, perhaps na-
tional network coverage, since this
is the first time this has been at-
tempted by a University. Kramer
commented that “This could put us
on the map."

Mishkin wished to thank Dr.
Thorne, Mr. Brown and Mr. Van
Dyke, who have been indispensable
in getting the arrangements this
far. He concluded that the student
body would rise to support the tele-
thon because, “everyone we have
asked to help has done so. This
project will work if we make it
work."

IFG To Present
Fellini Production,
111 Strode’ Tonight

Federico Fellln’s acclaimed "La
Strada" is this week’s presentation
of the International Film Group.

Gluletta Masina (who played the
title role in “Juliet of the Spirits")
and Anthony Quinn star in what some
critics feel to be Fellini's finest film
effort. The story is that of a naive
girl taken from home by Zampano,
a circus strongman, to perform in
his traveling act. The relationship
between them is affected byaclever
traveling clown who constantly goods
the brutish Zampano. Tragedy res-
sults, and only then does Zampano
realize that he is now utterly alone.

Fellini, director of “Nights of
Cablria,” (shown by the IFG last
year), “8 1/2,” and the controver-
sial “La Dolce Vita," displays in
this film the love of simple people
and the Italian countryside have dis-
tinguished his other films. Critics
have found it a unique blend of
subtle poetry and graphic realism.

“La Strada" will be shown tonight
in Draper 349 at 7:00 and 9:15. Ad-
mission is 35¢ with student in.
