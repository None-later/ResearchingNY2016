Monday night in the Ballroom.

Area Doctors Resent

Unpaid Medical Bills

’Complaints from local doctors
concerning student payment of bills
was the main topic of discussion at
the President’s Conference Monday.
Dr. Clifton Thorne, vice-president
for student affairs, mentioned the
complaints because the number was
“above normal.” i

The doctors have been concerned
because the University students have
not been paying their bills. Payment
should be made through the Student
Insurance after the student has sent
the doctor’s bill to the insurance
company and received the payment.

Evidently, however, the money
has not been reaching the doctor.
There are several problems created
by this lack of payment. First, the
student gets a bad credit rating
himself. Secondly, the University
receives a bad name, and thirdly,
students in the future will have a
difficult time being treated by a

doctor who is reluctant to handle

U
"ShilltlhtXSStl'ge'lhsé problem were

discussed at- the Conference, but
the group present was generally not
in favor of direct University inter-
vention. A suggestion was made that
Student Association handle the for-
mulation of a policy since they are
the lines responsible for setting up
the policy.

No penalty system was presented,
but Dr. Thorne pointed out, unpaid
bills could leopardize future deal-
ings with the medical profession in
the community.

The possibility of meal tickets
which could be used for meals in
more than one quad or the Campus
Center facilities when open was
also discussed. President Evan R.
Collins reported that serious con-
sideration was being given this issue
but it would not be put into effect
before next semester.

’r‘il’iiii'irsm :
0n Woman With British Team

by Jill Poinik

Mark Miringoff, the Senior mem-
ber of the American Team began by

M" Dav“ Hum an“ Miss Pamela stating that "voices representing

logs from Great Britain and Mr.
Mark Miringoff and Stratton Rawson
from the University debated on their

views concerning Vietnam Monday

night.

The British team presented argu-
ments affirming our position -in
Vietnam. Mr. Hunt based his 're-
marks on three major points.

His first reason for our remain-
ing in Vietnam concerned the de-
fense against aggression. it is not
,a civil war, rather, it was in-
stigated by North Vietnam which
received moral and material sup:
port from Russia and Red China.

As support Mr. Hunt cited the
numerous killings of village chiefs
in the south by guerillas. By the
end of 1965 20,00 minor officials
had been murdered.

Our goal in Vietnam is to pur-
sue the Truman Doctrine, to protect
against aggression and the massacre
of innocents.

Mr. Hunts second major point was
that this was an enlightened war in
which we are trying to develop the
agriculture of the country, in addi-
tion to the industrial output. Im-
provements are also taking place in
the fields of education, housing and
public health.

The fight against Communism
comprised Mr. Hunt's third point.
We are fighting in Viet Nam, “not
only to help the South Vietnamese
but also to sustain independence and
freedom in South East Asia.

Hunt used the Munich appease-
ment as analogous to what would hap-
pen in Viet Nam if we followed the
same policy.

Southeast Asia’s strategic signi-
ficance was then brought to light by
Hunt who cited its position in ref-
erence. to the East-West air and
sea lanes that cross Vietnam. Also,
Australia, New Zealand and the
Phillipines are located in the im-
mediate area, although Vietnam is
the main gateway between the Pacific

many and varied points of view urge
a deescalation end to military oper-
ation, and a beginning to negotia-
tion.”

Miringoff, in opposition to Hunt's
Dominoe theory quoted U Thant as
saying, "I do not believe that the
Domino theory is valid, nor that
Viet Nam is strategic to Western
defense."

As for foreign aid to the Viet
Cong, Miringoff quoted a statment
made in the “New York World Tele-
gram" in January of 1965: "There
is not one shred of evidence that
the weapons used by the Viet Cong
originate in the North." The wea-
pons were homemade at first and
then captured from the "the inept
defenders of South Viet Nam.”

"The primary presupposition on
which our involvement is based,
that the North had aggressed against
the South, is grossly inaccurate.
The point is clear, we have made a

mistake, and to fight on in View
this, as the Affirmative would hall’sf
us do, would be to recognize our
error, and to take direct steps to-
ward negotiations based on politi
realities, is our only course." '
After each member of both teams
gave their ten-minute speeches stat-
ing their views, each gave a five
minute speech refuting what the op-
position had st..'.ed, following which,

directed at both teams.

Also directed to the British team
was the question, "Did American
intensification of the war spur the
Chinese on to’aid the Viet Cong?"
The answer was that, "Mao re-
gards certain provinces as having
to be suppressed or overcome," it
they oppose his pursuits.

When asked how the war couhm
justified when Eisenhower stated in
his recent book that if free and open
elections had been held in certain
provinces the North Vietnamese
would have won, Hunt replied that the
voters still would have been coerced
because the Viet Cong controlled
those provinces.

Schaefer Announces

 Results ill’Surrcy,

Exhausts Pollutc Air

The results of an atmospherical
survey have recently been announced
by Dr. Vincent R. Schaefer, director
of the Atmospheric Sciences Re-
..erch Center. Schaefer reported
that the air'over the continental
United States has been polluted by
the anti-knock compounds in the ex-
haust from autos.

The lead from this gasoline was
found by Schaefer andhis associates
in a continuous smog-filled blanket
of air from the Pacific to the Atlantic
Coasts. This extensive mass of pol-
lution is worrisome and emphasizes
the dangers ahead if pollution isn’t
reduced at‘its sourco.

wi‘he researches made an extensive
satiny of the air in New York State in
this survey during the Thanksgiving
Season. Concentrations of polluted
particles as high as 500,000 per
cubic centimeter were found at the
edge of the smog over New York
City. The cleanest air encountered
during the survey was found over
the Adirondack Mountains.

However, measurements showed
in general that serious levels of
pollution are not limited only to
centers of high population. Schaefer

lnted out that when there is not
gosh country air to flush out the
built-up pollution in the urban area,
a massive weather change from the
northern part of the continent is
needed to afford relief.

Reasoning the importance of the
entire survey to New York State
Schaefer said, “The reason we go
out of state to make such measure-
ments is that the air over the M15-
sissippi Valley in the evening is
often over New York State the next
day.” The ﬂight covered a total
distance of 6,300 miles during which
time 266 sets of in-flight measure-
.ents were secured.

Grant Awarded

For Research

Dr. Narayan R. Gokhale, chair-
man of the department of earth and
atmospheric sciences at State Uni-
versity of New York at Albany, has
received an additional $10,800 grant
from the National Science Founda-
tion to continue his research work
on "Ice Formation by Contact Nu-
cleation.”

I The investigation seeks further
understanding of the formation of
ice crystals and pellets in coni-
paratively warm regions uicumulus
clouds (temperatures not colder than
minus 6 degrees centigrade) and at
the edges of such clouds. Dr. Gok-
holes total award [1 mn NSl" amounts
to $32,000 for a iwu—year period.

bring Eric Andersen in folk concert
to Gibbons Hall at Siena College,
Londonville, at 8:00 pm. on March‘
11. The public and area colleges
are invited to attend.

The New York World Telegram
wrote of Eric Andersen: “He is a
young singer-composer with avoice
to savor. He sings all his own tunes,
and they are, without exception, ex-
cellent, the melodies simple yet
different, the lyrics unpretentious.

Whether Andersen is doing apro-
test song, love ballad,’ or a chil-
dren’s song about a bumblebee, he
demonstrates talent as a writer and
skill as a performer."

Andersen’s songs have been re-
corded by Judy Collins, Pete Seeger,
Joan Baez, The Brothers Four,

Johnny Cash, and the Mitchell Trio.
His albums include “New Folks, Vol.
II," “Today is the Highway," and
