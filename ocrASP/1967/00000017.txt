leadership Training Workshop
Educational, Social Success

A group of thirty-five students
and ten members of the Student
Activities staff and faculty spent
last weekend at the overnight Stu-
dent Leadership Training Workshop
at Camp Dippikill.

I .

The ultimate goal of the session
was to develop leadership qualities,
although it was found difficult to de-
fine these specific characteristics.
Among other things, the agenda pro-
vided for small group discussions
which attempted to explore group
dynamics and the group process in
order to help the members analyze
and understand their own behavior,
in groups.

A further objective is to extend
these experiences to all leaders on
campus by the distribution of a
booklet which will include the final
reports of the ten areas discussed.

Brown Key Speaker

Mr. Neil Brown oi the Student
Activities staff was the keynote
speaker. His address opened the
conference by stating some of the
problems of group decision-mak-
ing, and by setting the tone for
the informality of the conference
which was to prevail during the en-
tire weekend.

Following through on this atmos-
phere of informality, an eager staff
of Student Activities people and a
well-prepared staff of student as-
sistants led the small group work.

The students included the Work-
shop co-chairmen Bill Cleveland
and Laurel Avin, and their assis-
tants Howie Chesin, Jim Hargraves,
Ray Cianfrlni, and Steve Chermiske.

An evaluation was made by the
participants at the conclusion of
the program. It was nearly unan-
imously agreed that the weekend
was a stimulating experience both
educationally and socially. As a

result of this enthusiastic response,
it was decided that the Workshop
will become an annual institution
for leadership development at Al-
bany. _

The University delegation to the
Cornell Conference on Vietnam, held
at Cornell University last weekend,
sat out the vote on two of the three
resolutions to come out of the con-
ference. A negative vote was cast
on a third resolution.

Although a mix-up occurred when
the delegates, Henry Madej and Sey-
mour Zachar, were mistaken as
being part of a group of delegates
who walked out on the conference,
Madej stated “We stayed on to go on
record as not voting on the resolu-
tion, and thus our feeling that the
conference was not properly rep-
res‘entatlve."' .

Confusion on this matter was in-
tensified because the other Univer-
sity delegates, William Cleveland
and Jet! Mishkln, had left the con-
ference early due to previous com-
mittments to the Leadership Confer-
ence held at Dippikill.

Sat Out Resolution

The delegates sat out the vote on
a resolution passed Sunday which
called for “prompt cessation” of
all bombing in Vietnam, and an im-
mediate cease flre. it also stated
the U. S. had the major responsibility
for terminating the war.

The delegation lost a negative vote
to a resolution to abolish the draft
on the grounds "it was ambiguous
and offered oniy_criticism, without
setting forth any alternative.”

hey also sat out a resolution
condemning American involvement
in Thailand on the grounds it might
lead to another Vietnam situation.
Both of the latter resolutions were
defeated.

The delegates explained they felt
true representation of entire student
bodies of the schools attending was
not even strived for, and cited cases
of at least 12 schools whose dele-
gations were practically autonomous
of their student bodies.

Consensus Needed

They said they felt in order to
pass any resolutions representing

Polo-Shirts

 

a national consensus of student opin-
ion, representation must be as in-
dicative as possible of the body it
represents.

In the case of the University dele-
gation, who volunteered from Cen-
tral Council, the delegation was
authorized to sign any resolutions
only as a representative body from
the Central Council of the Univer-
sity, Madej said.

Signature of any resolution in the

Goldberg Edits

name of the student body would first
have to be considered by Central
Council, and possibly sent before
the student body in referendum, ac-
cording to Made].

The delegation also said they leg
at no time were they offered any
intelligent discussion on Vietnam;
rather the conference was, from the
onset, only a question of how strin—
gently to condemn the administra—
tion.

a Business Fraternity

F armed By Students

Last April a group of business
students and faculty formed a local
business fraternity. The purpose
of the group is to promote profes-
sionallty among its members who
plan to pursue careers in the world
of business.

In line with this purpose, our
program stresses professional ac-
tivities such as outside speakers.

All-Quad Range
Planned by WSUA

Sometime this semester allquads
will be able to hear radio station
WSUA. This news was revealed at a
conference of WSUA radio engi-
neers.

The conlerence, held on Saturday
morning, Feb. 18, heard reports
from two of its engineers, Wayne
Gearing and Marty Mcindoe.

Gearing’s report consisted of an
outlook for the future. His main
theme was the expansion of the sta-
tions transmitting power. Gearing
said that sometime this semester
reception at the Dutch Quad would
be improved and reception at the
Colonial Quad and the Campus Cen-
ter would be introduced.

He explained that the delays were
caused by a shortage of personnel
and funds, and a lack of coopera-
tion from the construction workers
on the uptown campus.

The other major improvement
planned for this semester is the
installation of a “beeper phone."
Gearing explained that this will al-
low listeners to express themselves
directly over the radio on such
shows as “Frank Line” and “Ex-
pose 6’1."

Mcindoe's report was a summary
of the accomplishments of last se-
mester by WSUA.

business tours, forums, and busi—
ness projects, while acting within
the structure of a Greek organiza-
tion. In addition, it sponsors a so-
cial program similar to that found
in “social” fraternities.

National Alliliation

Upon formation, the local group
tentatively took the name, Alpha
Sigma Upsilon. It was decided that
our goal of professionality in busi-
ness could be made more readily
achieved if we were affiliated with
a national fraternity.

As a result, our efforts since
formation have been directed to-
ward affiliation with Delta Sigma
Pi, the largest international busi-
nessfraternity, which has 145 chap-
ters in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.

Our efforts thus far have been
fruitful, and our goal of national af-
filiation as near attainment. On
Jan. 3, the local brothers of A.S.U.
were inducted as pledges to Delta
Sigma Pi.

lo Appearln April,
Concert At Armory

The Council for Contemporary
Music has announced plans for its
third big concert of the year/Fol-
lowing up two most successful con-
certs by Jay anddhe Americans and
the Brothers Four, the Lovln’ Spoon-
ful will appear at the Armory on
Friday, April 14.

The four member folk-rock group
is comprised of John Sebastian, a
former sail maker and jug band
member born and raised in the Vil-
lage playing guitar and harmonica,
and Zal Yanuvsky, a folk singing
high school dropout from Toronto
on lead guitar.

Rounding out the group are Steve
Boone, who took up guitar while in
traction after an accident, on bass,
and Joe Butler, a Long Island native
who claims he was picked up by the
group solely because he was the
only person in the Village who
didn’t play guitar.

Fired from their first job at the
Night Owl Cafe, the group retired
to the basement of the Albert Hotel
and spent two months developing a
sound of their own.

Rehlred by the duly impressed
owner of the Night Owl, they were
an immediate success.

Tickets for the 8:30 performance
will be sold at three, four, and five
dollars, and a half price reduction
will be given to student tax card
