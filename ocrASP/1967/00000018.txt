Any attempt to recommend students for
elective positions available at this time
is an impossible task. First of all, the
candidates have not yet been checked by
any sort of committee. The result of
this is that there are two people who
think they are running for a seat on
Central Council from the Dutch Quad-
rangle. The problem is that this posi-
tion does not exist.

There are other names in the list of
candidates, of course, but for all we
know these people don’t even exist. In
addition there is someont living on one
quad but running for a set from another
quad.

When one of these people running for
the wrong position, at the wrong time
was questioned, complete ignorance was
exhibited. We would think that people
desiring a seat on the governmentalbody
representing all students would do at
least a slight bit of investigation.

We cannot expect the average student
to know everything about student govern-
ment, but student government, specifi-
cally Election Commission, should know
something about students. They should
know enough to check the applications
before releasing the names to the
“press.”

As far as class office elections, we
had never intended to make recommen-
dations.

We hope the MYSKANIA nominations
will better lend themselves to recom-
mendation. After being screened byga
committee of responsible people and
approved by Central Council. the MYS-

   
   
 
  
      
   

 

 

No matter how exhonibont thecost - we'll be there!

KANIA nominees should reﬂect more
organization and. We hope. more thought
than these other indications of a demo-
cratic student government.

Revision Needed

Monday President Collins raised the
question of how much, if any. responsi—
bility or jurisdiction the University
should assume over those students cov-
ered by student insurance who are lax.
in paying their medical bills. This pre-
sents a problem vital'to the University
because other members of the Univer-
sity Community may suffer innocently
by the action of these students because
of professional hesitation to give special
service to notoriously bad business
risks.

Under present policy students are able
to receive direct reimbursement from
the insurance company, without proof of
payment of the original bill. The prob-
lem lies, of course, with those students
who are receiving reimbursements while
neglecting to pay the initial medicalbill.

We feel that the first step should be
taken by the Student Association (who
contracts the company providing student
insurance) in clearing up what seems to
be a sloppy policy. Much confusion (and
fraud) could be eliminated by returning
to the old policy of issuing insurance
checks made payable only to the physi—
clan. If a student wishes to pay cash the
medical office concerned could simply
dispatch a form stating they had re-
ceived payment from the student and
ask the insurance company to dispatch
a reimbursement check to the student.

Defends Albee

To the Editor:

1 do not mean to defend the l’rimer
or its contributors from the ire of
the ASP’s redoubtahle critic, Miss
Downing. Nor do 1 menu to defend
myself, forpiaywrights, like critics,
are certainly often guilty of Opacity
and lack of depth. i write instead in
order to defend Edwar Albee from
the‘ruinous sort oi profess contained
in Miss Downing’s re lew. ldo not

by my defense intend to imply that

praise from a reviewer with tastes
such as those of Miss Dm‘nlng's is
necessarily ruinous. l merely mean
to state that to call Mr. Albee's
work opaque and deep is, ifnotaro-
mark of a person not sufficiently
learned in the background of the
modern theater, then at least mis-
leading.

To call plays such as "The Zoo
Story," or "Who's Afraid of Vir-
ginia Wolf," opaque is, l believe,
silly. These plays yield readily to
critical analysis. Anyone equipped
with the rudiments of literary criti-
cism would certainly be able to
at v on the

 
 

matlc technique of these plays. But
perhaps Miss Downing had "’i‘iny
Alice" in mind when she wrote of
Albco’s opacity. "'l‘lny Alice" is,
in some ways, more difficult than,
for example, "The Zoo Story." liut
again themes, characterization, and
technique are by no means obscure.

Perhaps Miss Downing has fallen
into the trap of trying to superim-
pose symbolic logic on the theater.
The play certainly will not yield to
any attempt to try to forceAiooqual
B, and this is to Albee's credit.

But the praise of Albee contained
in Miss Downlng's review that
troubles me most is her accusation
of Albee as being "deep," whatever
that means. Miss Downing has ap-
peared to have equated "deep" with
"good," (i do not mean toilnply that
Miss Downing is.tho possessor of an
“A equals B" mentality.)

Albee's world is a surface world
in which people are incapable of
subtlety or deep feeling. Because
his characters are surface people,
communication breaks down along
with the dichotomy between illusion
and reality. While these ideas about
pelagic well taken and valid, and.

w

 

iui manner, they are evidence of
neither deep nor original thought.
These ideas have been present in
English theater since the time of
licnumont nnd lv‘lutr-her, lien John-
son and John Webster.

Mr. Albee ought to be praised for
what he hits accomplished, the
powerful dramatization of relevant
ideas, not the WI ting of deep and
obscure plays.

Student Trust?

To the Editor:

l'm flattered by the way SUNYA
students are trusted. Every time
we leave our grand and comfortable
library, we got to wait in a line
and then have our books examined,
or our hriefcases opened and in-
spectod. This is not only it waste
of time and of library personnel,
but also a royal pain in the seat.
Worst of all, such inspections are.
taclless lnsinuatlons that every stu-
dent in crooked. Besides, if i felt
like stealing books, l'd put them in
my own bookiackets, stuff them in-
side my coat, or (trap them out the

u in".

 

by Igor Koreluh *

The folk scene is all but the!
anymore. Don’t get me wrong, there
is still good straight folk and straight
folk interpreters, like Tom,Paxton
and Eric Anderson, but folk artists
are progressing with new and orig-
inal methods and materials. It's been
a long evolutionary process since
the days We were hung-on "Froggy
Went.‘A’Courtln,” and this reviewer

is the» first to applaud the movement.

The 'Paul Buttorfield Blues Band
was part of the spearhead of this
movement. Folk was still P, Pam
and “Tom Dooley" when they first
introduced "electronified blues."
Things are different now, but the
Paul Butterfield group is stillhang-
ing-in.

Their latest release East-West
(EKL-315) is a combination of the
old (electronified blues)with a sharp
look at the future experiments of
Paul Butterfleld.

If you have heard their first al-
bum you may at first feel disap-
pointed. But as the record pro-
gresses the innovations become evi-
dent and you know that that was
$4.79 you didn’t waste.

Most of the first side is in the
"traditional" blues style of the
group, much like their first album.
Butterfield does just about every-
thing possible and much which seems
impossible on his harmonica.

"These songs include “Working
Blues," “1 Got A Mind To Give Up
Living,” and "All These Blues."
“Get Out of My Life, Woman" itas
elements of modern soul with a fine
example of blues piano by Naftalin.

My nomination for best song’ on
this side is “Work Song," with
Mike Bloomfield and Elvin Bishop
sharing lead guitar duties, Paul
Butterfield in a low, moaning har-
monica solo, and Mark Naftalin on
the organ. The tune displays the

. "snag, February)! 1967

wide range of ingenuity this group
has in developing on a basic blues
melody.

The second side starts with
"Mary, Mary” and is by far the
best interpretation of the song I've
heard. Paul Butt‘erfield excels in
his pleading, almost sensual vocal-
izations and playing. “Two Trains
Running" is a classic example of
the Butterfield style.

In "Never Say No" Elvin Bishop
takes over on the vocal and outdoes
the singing accomplishment’s of
Paul Butterfield's “Mary, Mary,"
by presenting the bluest blues.

Finally, a fitting and to the album
is the original instrumental "East-
West." In this number the entire
band is put to‘ the test of both tech-
nique and interpretation. Elvin
Bishop is superb on his solo which
encompasses almost seven minutes
of this 13:10 composition. He, along
with Mike Bloomfield, achieve many
most sitar-like soundstoward the
first climax ending the Eastern in-
terpretation of these blues.
Throughout Butterfleid is magnifi-
cent with his interspacod harmonica
solos. Mike Bloomfield then takes
us through the Western interpreta-
tion and to the final climax when
both sounds are combined lnadeler-
ious instrumentalization for a wild
and magnificent finish.

The only thing i missed was the
gruff voice and insistent rhythms
of Sam Lay whose drums have been
taken over since the first record-
ing, technically, butnot emotionally,
by Billy Davenport.

These notes need no conclusion,
for it is found in the closing number
of the album, and in leaving one is
satisfied. But for conclusion's sake
f’ll note that the Paul Butterfield
Blues Band may be seen tonight at
10:00 on the ABC special"The Song-
makers" on Channel 13.

Forum Commended

During the past few years many students have be-
come interested in the United Statics foreign policy.
One of the ways in Which students’ desire for knowl-
edge in this area has been satiated has been through

Forum of Politics.

Forum's program attempts to be informative as
well as provacative. Students may hear views on im-
portant matters other than their own or fellow stu—
dents. The speakers that are chosen for a presenta-
tion for Forum have all been carefully selected.

The speaker is judged on both his ability to speak
as well as his knowledge of his subject matter. It is
true that in the past Forum has presented some
speakers who have not had big names. They have
nevertheless been worthwile.

Barrett McGurn. John Stoessinger and David Keith
Hardy are such worthwhile speakers presented by
Forum of Politics in the past. The response to these
speakers was good, but stucients are ‘still reluctant.
to attend an evening lecture by one of these individuals

whom they don’t know.

On today’s front page we have a story about Con-
gressman Jonathan Bingham who will speak here
Monday. His background is impressive andproves him
qualified for his topic. Forum planned this series
with similar qualified people with different views on
various topics. Their research and planning shouldbe
rewarded with favorable attendance.

'Vilallaret'llaltes llit

lln illd Broadway,
Sad,- 98erious Show

Ellie Kaufman.

"Cabaret" is a great big, enor.
mous musical hit new on the boards
in New York. This play depicts the
coming of the Nazis to Berlin in
1929-30 in a manner which has
never been applied to this earth-
shaking event.

"Cabaret" achieves this ina very
quiet way, never once mentioning
the word "Nazi." The show begins
with .1991 Grey playing a harliqutn-
esque master of ceremonies in the
Kit Kat Klub which is dominated by
a four piece female band.

He strides on stage singing"Wil-
kommen," a very pleasant song
which welcomes the audience in
three languages to "Cabaret" and
invites them to “leave your troubles
outside. So life is disappointing?
Forget it. in here life is beautiful,
even the orchestra is beautiful."

Joel Grey, as the nightclub mas-
ter of ceremonies, is the best thing
to hit Broadway in years. He has
fantastic stage presence, a wonder-
ful way with the audience, a very
different voice, and all the qualities
which went into a Jolson or a Can-
tor.

His best moment comes when he
dances with a black gorilla in a
pink tutu singing "If I Could See
Her in My Eyes."

"Cabaret" is old Broadway,filled
with songs, dances, and fantastic
scenery. But this show is different;
it is serious. While we are all sing-
ing and dancing at the Cabaret, the
Nazis are slowly infiltrating the
German world. It is all very sad,
but it is achieved in asortofbeauti-
ful way.

If you can get a ticket, you will
fully enjoy "Cabaret" and will agree
that it is definitely the best musical
ever to hit New York.

Statesman Plan Big Season,
To Perform At Expo ’67

by Mark Zach

The statesmen, in keeping with
the aspect of change affecting the
entire University, have contracted
this year what is perhaps the big-
gest and best of their fifteen sea-
sons to date. This musical group
is made up of thirty men selected
in competitive tryouts under the
directorship of Karl A. E. Peterson.

Their biggest appearance planned
for this season is a performance at
the World's Fair, Expo '67, in Sep-
tember. For this engagement the
group sent several tapes of their

Successful Film,

Misrepresented in Advertising

by Dougla s Roihgeb

There are two very unpardonable things wrong with
Ross Hunter's "The Pad” that almost, but not quite,
make you forget what a good little film it is. And the
disconcerting thing is that both unpardonables are not
to be found in the film itself, but rather in the adver-

tising campaign.

Never has a film been so
grossly misrepresented by
its advertising as this one.
On the surface. it seems
to be a comedy. Well. it is
and it isn’t.

Secondly, it seems to be an out-
rageous copy of Richard Lester's
superb face "The Knack...And How
To Get it,” copying not only the
lettering of "The Knack" posters

combination succeeds most admir-
ably.

Not Total Success

This is not to say, however, that
"The Pad" is a total success. it is
more commercially oriented than
"The Knack" was and sports a few
lapses of interest here and there.

But aside from the flaws, the
film gives good cause to hope that
Hollywood might try a few more
like it. Maybe the success of "The
Pad," with its realistic and mean-

but the hill title as well (“The Pad.’ “'5‘” Wm" might 9mm“ “her

And How To Use it").

Telethon Performance

On March 10 and ll they will be
heard in the Mental Health Tele-
thon in the Ballroom of the Campus
Center. The statesmen have also
planned to compete in the Intercol-
legiate Choral Festival in Burling-
ton, Vermont in May.

In addition to these performances
the group will appear at the West
Point Officers Dinner Dance and at
Fenimore House in Cooperstown as
part of the February "Sunday Ser-
ies" sponsored by the nationally
known New York State Historical
Association.

The Siatesmen's repertoire is
large and varied, including classi-
cal, sacred, semi-popuiar, and tra-
ditional works. One of these selec-
tions is Randall Thompson's "The

of four passages from the writings
of Thomas Jefferson.

One of a series of Faculty Concerts was performed '_
on Tuesday night before a sizable audience in Page ’

James Morris. Trumpet; Findlay Cockrell. Piano. 
assisted by Arthur Catricala. Violonocello. The con-
cert was opened with Beethoven’s Trio inB ﬂat Major

was performed quite adequately.

volume and phrasing.
For Next Production

Cockrell also turned in an excel-

lent performance. But the Violin-
cello was definitely a distraction.
The player’s cuff links were con- 51 Din“ smewm'
tinually tapping the instrument caus-
ir 5 a noise, his tone lacked clarity,
and his playing was sloppy through-
out. The only time they were together
was in the Allegretto.

“ My tooski My toosk 1 She touched
my tooskl Oooooohhhhhl"

"Of course, my best role was
Barbara of Seville...”

These may - indeed, are - highly
unusual utterances to be made on
stage; yet that is exactly where they
are made, as the eleventh annual
State University Revue rehearsals
each night in the ballroom of the
Campus Center.

It would be unfair to reveal at
this point‘ which characters make
these statements, but suffice it to
say that they are by far the most
winning characters to be seen on
any stage since Kukia,. Fran and
Ollie.

Brahms’ Sonata

Brahms' Sonata in E flat Major,
opus 120, no. 2 was performed’ex-
cellently. it was one of Hudson’s
best performances. Cockrell was
also at his finest - a marvelous
duetl

Morris's performance of Tele-
mann’s Concerto in D Major for
Trumpet was lacking. His upper
register seemed very strained,des-
plte his clear tone, and there were
many mistakes. This performance
missed the bright yet stark charac-
ter which is so much a part of
Baroque music.

Without the fine accompaniment
of Cockrell and Catricala, which
provided the needed base, this num-
ber would have failed.

Choice is "Carnival"

And in that, they are typical of
the show as a whole; "Carnival,"
the choice of this year's Revue
triumvirate (composed of director
John Fotla, producer Ellis Kauf-
man and stage manager Joyce Levy),
is probably the most delightful show
ever’ produced, bar none.

It is a show which somehow brings
out the child in each spectator,until,
willing or not, he is drawn into the
proceedings as much as any of the
people romping on stage.

That the Revue is in such an ad-
vanced stage of preparation with
performance dates still two months
in advance is a tribute to the organ-
lzatlonal ability of its director.

Morris Comeback

Morris made a terrific comeback
to make ills performance of Halsey
Stevens’ Sonata the highlight of the
evening. This was a very delightful
and moving tonal work reminiscent
of Aaron Copland, particularly in
Allegro moderate. Cockrell and
Morris both did an excellent job.

The most disheartening part of
the evening was the ignorance dis-
played by the audience in applaud-

 

in this performance will be the Uni-
versity Band.

Another of the selections which
they will be performing, this one
at the World’s Fair is a series of
songs adapted and arranged by Aaron
Copland. These songs of Americana
include a lullaby, is nonsense song
and an old hymn.

Others of their stand-bye are
“Brothers Sing On” which has been
adopted as their theme song, “Vis-
ions,” a Swedish folk song, an old
sea chanty called "Old Man Noah"
and "Gaudeamus" which is a well
known glee club standard and aud-
ience favorite.

Fotlo Changes

in the two years since he has as-
sumed its leadership, Fotla has
changed the Revue from a some-
time thing cast early in April and
produced late the same month (and
enjoyed mostly by those on the stage,
rather than those observing) to a
professionally run, organized oper-
often.

As any veteran of past Revues
knows, the task is gargantuan; and
anyone who doubts that it is being
accomplished need only stop in at
rehearsals some night, listen to the

 

 

whistle and watch proceedings. He
