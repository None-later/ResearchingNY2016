lllilllllli Recommendations

Although MYSKANIA recommended
three juniors for next year's MYSKAN-
IA, we feel that onename. at least, is
sorely missing from thatlist. This is
the name of William-Cleveland, Student
Association President". \; - 7‘

We are aware of the controversy sur-
rounding the jobs he has held‘this year,
but do not think that the negative name
calling which hasbeen going on should
keep him from MYSKANIA. v

Personal feelings" have also entered
this contest. Instead of keeping the cri-
teria for judgment to “leadership. re-
liability, good judgment', contributions
to the University. initiative, and schol-
arship,” MYSKANIA has probably relied
on its misguided personal bias.

Of course, there will undoubtedly be
much controversy. over who should be
on MYSKANIA and who shouldn’t, There
always is.

This year, however, the matter is

llore Election Problems

Certain aspects of the campaign for
class offices this week are annoying.
There is one set of candidates who have
decided to contact every member of their
class by telephone. It is quite upsetting
to receive six phone calls in one suite
saying vote for so-and-so.

Campaign posters are another source
of criticism. They have blossomed all
over the campus in unexpected places.
We know there is a restricted area for
these posters. but there doesn’t seem to
be any committee or commission to
regulate the placing of these posters.

We saw one student who was obviously
annoyed _when he went to get a drink of
water and saw a poster above him. He
immediately ripped the poster down and
threw it away. We asked him if he ob—
jected to one of the candidates, but he
replied he hadn’t even read it. He just

complicated by the fact that income knows
why_these people should be chosen. No
one knows what they will be called on to
do. What is the purpose of this group?

This confusion has resulted in every
individual judging the MYSKANIA candi-
date in his own way, for whatever pur—
pose he wants. The confusion is only
getting worse. MYSKANIA's position
should be clarified soon.

We know our recommendations will not
please everyone any more than MYSKAN-
IA’s pleased ‘us. but here they are

didn't like seeing the poster there.

A limited amount of poster space has
caused many candidates to turn to the
ASP for advertising space. Students don’t
seem to realize that there is not much
space in the paper for extenive ads for
every candidate.

Candidates are annoyed when they dis-
cover it is “first come first served” or
that their opponent is also advertising
in the same issue. Next the ASP is be—
selged with questions about opponent’s
campaign tactics.

The ASP has become a political battle
ground. In future years and campaigns
we may have to allow no ads at all from
candidates to alleviate this battle. We
don’t need this kind of trouble. We have
enough.

Forlorn Counter intelligence

by Martin Salmon:

Last week I discussed my feelings
about the current ClA-NSA contro-
versy. The feedback from this col-
umn‘shows that a further clarifica-
tion of my position is necessary.

No defense of the CIA was in-
tended. I do admit to a lack of overt
concern with the dealings of the
CIA, and to a bewilderment at the
current widespread suspicion of
anything pro-American. For this I
have been denounced as a traitor
since I am leftist enough to be a
registered member of the Liberal
Party. ,

A major theme last week was that
if I not approve of the basic motives
behind NSA’s use of government
money, then I don’t deplore it. The
only wrong that I find with the func-
tion of the NSA is my disagreement
with some of their political pro-
nouncements; many of which have
been anti-CIA, incidently.

The problem, to me, could be
that the money came from the CIA.
Perhaps the money should have come
from the State Department through
the USIS. But Senator Russell,
watchdog of CIA expenditures, tells
us that a public announcement of the
grant would have defeated its pur-
pose.

Secrecy in the CIA is necessary
to the national security. The major

purpose of the organization is to be
a fact finding agency for the highest
levels of government. What would
be the purpose of the agency if it
acted publicly, allowing the whole
world to observe it? We know that
foreign counterparts of the CIA (1.9.
GRU-Russian 4 Chief Intelligence
Agency) road American publications
carefully as an important source of
intelligence.

What is interesting is if Ram-
pans is so fascinated with the im-
portance of who supports whom,
why have they steadfastly-refused
to disclose their backers?Recently,
the editors refused to do same on
the Barry Gray Show on WMCA in
New York City.

Most important of all, however,
is the outcome of the controversy.

What did Ramparts, The New York.

Times, Russell Baker, et. al, ac-
complislx’ First of all, my predic-
tions of last week are beginning to
come true. Skidmore, for one, has
voted to pull out of NSA. Left wing
radicals are hoarse from Scream-
ing, "subversion."

Will the CIA suffer from this
screaming? Or will a worthwlle,
hardworking, responsible student
grOup be the one to suffer. is it
worth it?

Commission Defended

To the Editors:

On behalf of the Commission on
Academic Affairs, I would like to
respond to the comments made by
Mr. Schwartz, regarding the "stag-
nant' student government on tilts
campus in the Feb. 14 ASP.

The following were the activities
entered into last semester by the
Commission:

1. Members of the Commission,
in conjunction with Associate Dean
Sorreli Chesin, were instrumental
in the coordination of the summer
and fall orientation program.

2. The Commission has taken ac-
tion to stimulate interest and in-
volvement in student government
among student organizations.

a. Representatives of the Com-
mission have been attending meet-
ings of Central Council so that the
operation of the two operations may
be optimally coordinated.

4. Steps were taken toward the
preparation of a course guide to
familiarize new students with spe-
cial requirements and nuances of
particular courses.

5. The Commission took charge
of arrangements for the appearance
of our team on the College Bowl, as
well as securing Mr. Gunn as coach,
selecting the learn, and making cer-
tain necessary arrangements.

6. The Commission nominated, at
the request of Dr. Morris and Dr.
Kendall, twelve students, six of
whom were to be chosen to be a
member of a special University
Seminar on Undergraduate Educa-
tion, whose purpose will be to con-
sider and discuss, during the pre-
sent scmester, certain recommen-
dations with respect to revision of
the University’s curricula.

It should be mentioned that at
least two entries in the list above,
entries 1 and 5, were self-evident
to any interested party, and that
information concerningths third, the
action regarding the University
Seminar, was submitted to the ASP
at least one week prior to the ap-
pearance of Mr. Schwartz's article.

In short, the accusation of con-
tributing to the "stagnancy" of the
University seems strangely mis-
placed when applied to an organi-
zation whose elected (NOT AP-
POINTED) members mot ton times
in the sixteen weeks of last semes-
ter. Academic Affairs Commission
is presently made up of nine indi-
viduals and its soopo therefore is
necessarily limited if.it does not
receive suggestions and suport
from faculty members, and, espe-
cially, fellow students. Any charges
of laxity on tile part of such an or-
ganization should be carefully re-
searched and substantiated, and if

found cogent, should be made di—
rectly to the organization involved
and accompanied by positive sug-
gestions. Anyone can accuse, but
responsibility and constructive cri-
ticism requires considerably more
time and effort.

Commission on Academic Affairs

Explain

To the Editors:

The '68-'69 campaign conducted
by our respective slates has been
called everything from presumpv
tuous to courageous. To all those
who would evaluate us, we would
explain our purposes in running.

We advertised slogans like “Boss
Cleveland and the STD Ring" to get
the student body thinking. We wanted
them to discern what prompted us
to pose that joke title, to analyze
an increasingly evident tendency in
our student government structure -
an extreme concentration of power,
and to ask themselves - is this
good?

First there was the question of a
single person hold many offices:
William Cleveland: SA president,
class president, STE president, etc.
We did not question Bill’s fitness to
fill any single political office, for
his leadership abilities are obvious
to all.

What we were questioning waslris
ability to do justice to a multitude
of offices. With our “Boss Cleve-
land" taunts we tried to draw Bill
out to defend his position; our efforts
were in vain.

Then there was the question of
many individuals associated with
Mr. Cleveland holding or seeking
office-particularly fraternity broth-
ers. Such an association will lncvll-
ablly constitute a power consolida—
tion, and such consolidations are
inherently detrimental to the minor-
ity in government.

These preceding questions are, we
feel, compelling. in running, we
serve the political purpose of prov
viding opposition to William Clova-
land and Jeffrey Mlshkin. It will he
the slectorate's decision as to
whether or not we are acceptable
opposition.

in summation, we should note that
our candidacles, though conceived on
negative notes, have taken on posi—
tive aspects. in our literature We
have outlined our policies, and if
elected we will serve our respec-
tive classes accordingly with as
much fervor as (if not more than)
our monems' John Canileld
