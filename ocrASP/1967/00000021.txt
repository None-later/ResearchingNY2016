by Dunc Nikon

Heavyweight Chet Krom utilized
a half-nelson and arm-‘bar to turn
his man to his back and pin him in
1:31. The pin gave the Albany State
grappiers their first shutout ever
as they blanked Brooklyn Poly 41—0.
Coach Garcia also got pins from
Warren Crow, Randy Palmer,Craig
Springer, and Art Recesso.~

The matmen, who are now 5-3-1
on the year, won 123 by forfeit, and
Crow then established the tone for
the match when he stacked his man
at 2:25.

Mike Poplaski was next onthe mat
for Albany, and a reversal and two
minutes riding time were enough
for a 4-1 decision, which upped the
match score to 13-0.

Palmer then scored his eighth
consecutive victory as he put his
many away 32 seconds into the sec-
ond period, after gaining a 5-0 lead
in the opening period. Springer fol-
lowed and he too pinned early in
the second period. Ahalf-nelson and
chicken wing put the Brooklyn Poly
Blue Jay on his back, and the pin
came at 2:46.

Frank Berry then gained an easy
5-0 victory in the'160 pound class
to up his record to 4-2 and the
Great Danes’ lead to adevastating
26-0.

Recesso continued the rout as
he underhooked his man and simply
powered his shoulders to the mat
for a 3:13 fall. Recesso has now
won three in a row, with pins in his
last two; he is now 6-3 for the
season.

Roger Gorham then won by for-
felt at 177, to make the match
score Albany 30 Brooklyn Poly 0,
and set the stage for Krom's dra-
matic pin. Chet scored a takedown
and a near pin before finally put-

1:31 mark, thus recording the only
first period pin of the day.

Our grapplers will meet Central
Connecticut today in an away match
and vie with Cortland State at home
onFriday.

won him the Pulitzer Prize for ex-
cellence in foreign reporting was
based upon 5 years as Moscow cor-
respondent for tho "Times"and ex-
tensive travel to Soviet Central Asia.

A sixth trip to llussla, made in
1901-1902, resulted in his book, “A

look at the Soviet challenge and
another appraisal of Russian relu-
tionships with Red China.

in the summer of 1900 Mr. Salis-
bury made a complete orbit around
China, traveling through Southeast
Asia on a trip that included Laos,
Burma and the lilmalayan-indian
border, up to Mongolia and Siberia.

With the approval of the U. S.

Dec. 1000 and Jan. 1007 in North
Vietnam, the reports of his trip

Education Program

Dean of the College of Arts and Sci-
ences.

The rest of this Seminar Group to
the Special Committee on Under-
graduate Education is composed of
four more faculty members and
seven students. Faculty are Dr.
Frank Kolmin, Dr. Eugene McLaren,
Dr. Alfred Finkelstein, Dr. Audrey
Kouvel.

The students are Frank Keyser,
Victoria Swigert, Deena Gold, Susan
Emborsky, Fred Chllds, Michael
Goidstein.

Dr. Fiser listed a number of topics
which the committee will consider in
making recommendations to the
Faculty Senate. The general objec-
tive of the group is “to create the
most exciting and interesting way of
education."

Some of the areas to be considered
are the lecture system, independent
or directed study and differentkinds .
of material in courses. The group
could decide to set up one or more
experimental colleges, or a faculty
evaluation.

This committee may also try to
consider the implications of students
learning from each other or the
educational implications of the Vaca-
tion periods. An application of the

‘Krapp’s Last Tape’
At Eye Tonight

"Krapp’s Last Tape" will again
be presented at the Golden Eye at
0 p.m. tonight. The play is per-
formed in one act and involves only
one character.

The story concerns Krupp, played
by Paul Villnni, who records a tape
of what he has done and what his
future will be every birthday for
thirty years. When he reaches the
age of 60, he plays all his tapas
back and finds himself disgusted
with the earlier man and has trouble
understanding his onrlior tapes.

Villa.” graduated from the State
University of New York at Albany in
1902 and since has studied with the
Circle in the Square players. John
Velie will direct play.

After the performance Velie and
Villani will discuss their production.

 

student involvement with the out-
side world could be explored.

The fact that many students are
now continuing their education di-
rectly to M.A. degrees could cause
consideration of a direct two year
and three year sequence instead of
the current two and two year under-
graduate process.

Another matter for the commit-
tee’s consideration is the system of
grading. It could be "pass or fail,"
or “pass, fail and honors.”

This committee expects to make
a report to the Academic Council
early next fall. Most changes that
might be favored by the committee
could be enacted by the Faculty
Senate.

The committee has already been
meeting once a week since January.
Later it plans to develop a method
of involving more students in its
considerations.

Key To Success

Bl Health Telethon

Everything possible is
being done by those con-
cerned with the Univer-
sity’s upcoming Mental
Health Telethon on March
10-11 to make itasuccess.
Plans are nearing com-
pletion.

 
  
   
  
 
 
 

Cooperation has been a keynote
throughout the past hectic weeks of
preparation. Televisions provided
by the communications department
will be set up in all Student Center

    
 

lounges in addition to the 800 per-
sons who can be seated within the
ballroom itself. Refreshments are
to be served in'the Student Center
cafeteria.

It has become necessary to de-
viate from the original plans to run
the telethon from 7 p.m. Friday to
7 Saturday evening, due to aprior
commitment of the television de-
partment. An abbreviated 22 hour
seven to five schedule has been
adopted by the telethon's executive
committee.

WSUA is planning a special this
Sunday evening from eight to nine
using time normally alloted to Ex-
pose 67, to publicize the telethon.

Announcers John Fleitman and
Terry Laconis will host co-chair-
men John Fotia and Jeff Mishkin,
who will discuss plans for, and the
purpose behind the Telethon. They
will also answer questions and com-
ments phoned in by students.

It remains for the student body to
make or break the Telethon.Tickets
will be sold at $1.50 to holders of
student tax cards, and at a cost of
$2.00 without.

Special note should be taken by
those students planning to attend
of Dr. Thorne’s announcement that

women's hours have been suspended
for the entire eveniiz'r, with the pur-
chase of a ticket.
