‘ The present members of the SDS
feel that there was no adequate way
.for interested persons to find out
about the war either on campus or
in the city of Albany so they have
reprints of pertinent
articles for 5? to 25¢.

Several free fact sheets on the

Movies on 3 by 5 Cards

He predicted that in the 21st cen-
tury full length motion pictures in
color and stereo would be available
on 3 by 5 cards which could easily
be inserted like time cards into a
machine.

Another amazing prediction for
the future will be the reduction of
a' 29,000 page encyclopedia into a
single 8 x 10 portrait.

In order to increase the imagina-
tion and creativeness oi the play-
wright drugs will be used. He also
predicted that by 1983 they would
have drugs that would change per-
sonalities. By 2012 drugs will be
used to raise intelligence levels.

Another innovation which will help
the motion picture industry will be
the extensive use of computers.
Flory indicated that the computers
will "prove to be a producer’s best
friend.”

They will enable the producer to
synetliize many scenes through the
computer while sound, sequences
and lip movement willautomatically
be attained.

Aside from its purpose as a social
function, which members felt was
"delightful and enjoyable," the eve-

sion of the semester plans.

Presently slated is a Spring din-
ner for members and faculty to be
held in April, and a possible trip
during the Spring recess.

The group is presently consider-
ing visiting Washington, D.C., Phil-
adelphia, or Williamsburg and final
decision will await the result of a
referendum. However, general con-
sensus seems to favor Washington,

The program offered by the WC
this week spotlights the earlier
phases of Chaplin’s development into
the most gifted and universally loved
actor of the silent period. “Tillie’s
Punctured Romance" (1914) was
Chaplin's first feature-length film
and indeed, the first feature-length
film comedy.

With the four other films on the

REP. JONATHAN B. BlNGHAM (Dem-Bronx) spoke to students

Negotiations With North Vietnam
Seen By Bingham As Best Solution

Congressman Jonathan B. Bing-
ham (Dem.-Bronx) supported seek-
ing negotiation with North Viet-
nam, ,as the best solution to the

)Vietnam situation, Monday night in
a lecture in the Ballroom entitled
"Vietnam Report."

The lecture was co-sponsored by
the University's Forum of Politics
and the Albany World Affairs Coun-
cil, and is the first in a series of
lectures on Vietnam planned by For-
um.

Bingham, who was elected to Con-
gress in 1964, said although he did
not consider himself an expert on
Vietnam, he could see “no simple
answers" to the situation. Bingham
offers a great deal of interest and
reading, a large background in pol-
itics, and experience with the State

apartment, the U.N., and the For-
eign Service, as criteria.

Finances Trip

Last year Bingham financed a
trip to South Vietnam in order to
become better acquainted with the
situation. He stated he had "no
difficulties” and received “fullem-
bassy cooperation.”

Bingham felt he has “tried hard
to learn as much as he could," and
said he was sure the warhawks are
almost completely wrong; however
he could not see a purely military
solution to the situation.

The opinions of the Doves, on the
other hand, are not feasible either.
Bingham stressed the idea that "we
cannot just quit."

U. N. Problem

He said taking the problem to the
U.N. is impractical because the U.N.
is not prepared to handle such a
conflict by the very fact that it was
not designed to handle situations
where the West is in conflict with
the East.

The question has already been

submitted to the Security Council
and is still hiding time on the agen-
da; farthermore when the problem
finally arises for consideration, the
chances of reaching any conclusion
because of the Soviet Union veto.

Bingham stated he is not in com-
plete accordance with the Adminis-
tration. Contrary to stated policy he
does not feel the U.S. is in Vietnam
simply because of SEATO commit-
ments, and is not in complete agree-
ment with the domino theory. He
cited the example of Thailand and
said he felt a parallel did not exist
at the present time; however, the
entire area will continue to be a
danger zone.

No Full Sympathy

Although Bingham is not in com-
plete sympathy with the reasons for
the U. S. intervention, he stated that
it is an irrevocable fact that “we
are there; we are committed; we
cannot simply withdraw.”
He presented two alternative sit-
uations: negotiation and success in
South Vietnam. Bingham stated that
success in the south would have to
be spread over many years, and is
therefore not as feasible.
Negotiation could end the situation
in the relatively near future. it

would involve asking the 17 non-
aligned nations to mediate a nega-
tiary conference in the Summer of
1965, to mediate another confer-
ence.

Assume Responsibility
These 17 non-aligned nations
would assume responsibility to in-
vite the National Liberation Front.

The U. 8., he stated, would thus
regain some of her world stature
by upholding what we supposedly
stand for.

Bingham was optimistic about
North Vietnam's reaction to such a
conference, especially if it were to
be proceeded by a six week cease
fire.
