Recent Graduate School Growth

Presents Problems illiorernment

by Roger Van Horn

With the tremendous growth ofthe
graduate school at SUNY Albany in
recent years, it has become more
and more evident that some form of
government-wholly separate from
that of the undergraduate division
of the University-is necessary to
serve the unique wants and needs
of the graduates.

Many of them join the academic
community for two and three year
periods. Studying as intensively as
they must, it becomes desirable
both for social and academic rea-
sons, that they have some sort of
out of class stimulation.

Two Problems

Two basic problems have ham-
pered past attempts to organize such
a government; first that it seems
both Ulogical and unfair thatagroup
of graduate students wishingto form
a government should have to pass
, through undergraduate channels of
recognition to do so, and secondly,
difficulties have arisen in getting a
large enough percentage of grad-
uates interested to form an effec-
tive organization.

To try and alleviate this situa-
tion, the Student Affairs Council of
Faculty Senate formed a sub-com-

Participants In CIA-NSA Clash
Rationalize Questioned Actions

by Bob Ewogen
The College Press Service

Well, scratch one dream.

The United States National Student
Assodation, the leading voice of
American Youth in the postwar era,
has officially admitted that it has
been supported for adecade by funds
of the Central Intelligence Agency.

As in most pacts of dishonor, it
was easy for both participants to
rationalize their actions. In the early
50’s USNSA was desperately short
of money, especially to carry on
their vital international program.
These programs included NSA's
membership in the international Stu-
dent Conference, scholarships to
such foreign nations as Algeria,
exchange programs and other vital
projects.

CIA Enters Picture

it is at this point that the CIA
entered the picture. USNSA has a
liberal image in Americ'. But in
the context of world student opin-
ion it emerged as a conservative
one. USNSA’s progressive ideals
and pragmatic Americanism were
probably America’s best image to
a world student body which blinks
at the jingoistlc term, “UnAmeri-
can" and fails to unrtrvrstand our
holy crusade against the forms of
socialism which many of their coun-
tries practice.

Furthermore, USNSA was the
most influential member, both fl.
nancially and spiritually, oi the in-
ternational Student Conference
(150). 150, composed mainly of
Western and neutralist nations, was
the only force blocking the rival
international Union of Students (lUS)
from dominating world student or-
zanizattons.

Headquarters In Prague
The lUB, headquartered in Prague,
Czechoslavakia, was and is dom-

mittee on student government and
organization under the chairman-
ship of Dr. Edith Cobane, and
charged it specifically with doing
something to help interested grad-
uate students in organizing.

Anxious to Help

As yet no major headway hasbeen
made by this group. Neil Brown,
executive secretary of the sub-
committee, commented that a prob-
lem exists in that they are so anx-
ious to assist the graduates that
any group, no matter how small a
segment of the grad student body it
represents, will be recognized.

Theoretically it is possible for
three or four of these splinter gov-
ernments to coexist, none fully ef-
fective due to a lack of majority
support. Two such bodies are pre-
sently, in existence, the Circle 20
Club and the Pierce Hall Asso-
ciation.

Most of the faculty and students
concerned agree that were an oper-
ative all-graduate student body to
be formed, it could coexist without
difficulty with the undergraduate’s
Central Council. it remains only for
a concerted effort to be made on
the part of the grad students them-
selves.

inated by Communist Youth Organ-
izations. Thus, the corrupt bargain
hence, this may be our greatest
diplomatic catastrophe of the post
war period.

We cannot excuse those in USNSA
who yielded principle in duress.
We cannot forgive those in govern-
ment who cynically exploited their
opportunity. But, in the final analy-
sis, we ourselves must share the
blame. We allowed USNSA to drift
into financial and spiritual crisis
by not providing it with a strong
base of support.

Outlived Usolulness
There are those who will say the
present scandal has demonstrated
that USNSA has outlived its useful-
ness. We disagree. if the associa-
tion is allowed to disintegrate, ano-
ther, weaker organization will no
doubt spring up to take its place,
one which is equally if not more
vulnerable to political entrapment.
The best safeguard the American
student community has against the
danger of becoming a pawn in the
cold war is a strong, broad-based,
vigorously-supported national union
of students. This USNSA can become

-- if we give it our support.

To this end, we propose that the
University of Colorado take immed-
iate steps to rejoin the National
Student Association and strongly
urge our sister schools in Colorado
to do the same.

As students and as Americans we
must begin anew. We must rebuild
USNSA from the ground up.

We must work doubly hard to re.
pair the incalculable damage to the
pride and, yes, the decency of our
friends abroad.

We must strengthen USNSA so
that it never again falls prey to
base and foolish men, who could
pervert it to their own ends,

"Keep the Fifth, Baby” westward
quite often from the man who popu-
‘ iorlzed the term by four university
students who slept on ther‘beaches
of Bimini over intercession.

Peter NIkos,’Dick WitkopJoe La-
,' man and Ed Rosenberg tort acarto
Florida and from there ferried
across to North Bimini, an island in
the Bahamas where the lowest re-
corded temperature is 40 degrees.

During the week they stayed at
Bimini the weather never went below
55 degrees and atnight only blankets
were necessary. The boys brought
no supplies with them and the only
thing Nakos had in the way ofequip-
ment was a knife.

There are a number of bars and
pool halls which thepeople frequent.
it is in one of these bars that the
boys first met Adam Clayton Powell
who came over and asked if they
were the boys living on the beach.

“The natives idolize him, mimic
him." When he walks downthestreet
there is always a group around him
and if he says something the na-
tives repeat it. Nakos found Powell
very congenial and witty.

lie came down to the beach to visit
the boys once and hegot alongeasily
with them. Whentheboys told Powell
what school they were from, he said
he thought the school was “spec-
tacular.” lie is a graduate of Col-
gate.

Jokes and small talk comprised
the major part of the conversation.
They did not discuss politics. Nakos
thought it might have been because
they came from New York that Pow-
ell paid extra attention to them, al-
though he feit completely at home
with him. _

Powell "seemed very confident
and jovial." He helda “carefree
attitude, as if he had no worries."

His- record is found in all the
juke boxes. It tells the people to
get educated because whites respect
only money and the vote.

One afternoon the boys met him
in the street around lunchtime. When
they told Powell they had no money,

was struck-—by USNSA out of ap-
parent necessity, by CIA out of cal-
lous opportunism.

For awhile the bargain worked.
USNSA built a strong financial base.
Last year they were strong enough
to give up CIA money entirely rather
than continue to compromise prin-
ciple. ClA had an effective American
voice in the councils of world stu-
dent opinion. But the fruits of the
poisoned tree cannot long endure
when the baseness of their genesis
is known.

For a generation of student lead-
ers USNSA was the mainspring of
their actions and the fountainhead
of their idealism. Now that source
is tainted.

In terms of the ideals of our
greatest organization, in terms of
the seriousness of our goals, in
terms of the very sanctity of human
idealism itself, we are the Betrayed
Generation. Long accustomed to dis-

trusting the establishment, we are
now dazed to find that we have been
but kept radicals, allowed to bray
nobly while chewing for fodder of
those who haVe cynically herded us
for their own ends. USNSA will be
a long time recovering.

To Pay Hoovlly
For its part the CIA will pay
heavily too. We have handicapped
ourselves with a permanent plateau

of distrust through world Youth. it
will be a long time before an Asian,
African or Latin American student
listens to an American visitor with-
out wonderiug if he has been sub-
sidized or screened to parrot words
not of his own chooaing. With the
new generation of stwent leaders,
who will be facing us across no.
gotiating tables a brief generation

 

he treated them to two pounds ofhot
dogs, a can of beans and a loafof
bread.

Nakos described, Bimini as being
a lazy place where “none of the
people-seem to work. They‘raise
pigs and collect couches with fish
nets and sell these items in Nas-
sau." Fishing is also a major part
of the economy. ‘

The tourist business also brings
in some money, altiwugh most visi-
tors take only one-day excursions
from Florida. Straw Hats made in
Bimini are popular souvenirs.

Food is expensive and the natives
make very little money. Milk sells
for sixty cents a quart and cakes
and breads are twice as much as in
the states. Fresh water is fifteen
cents a quart.

There are a handful of native
whites on the island although there
is little mingling between whites
and Negros. The dark natives can-
not be compared to the American

.‘ 'f ' '

Negros as many people think, They
do not resent whitepeople.Some say
hello as you walk down the street
even though they don’t know you.
The lazy ways of the people of
Bimini help to create “a restful
atmosphere" in which you may “hide:
away from everything."

Often, a player will find himself
in a three no-trump contract where
‘here is a lack of transportation

*etween his own hand and .dummy’s.
One method ofovercomingthis enig-
ma is to let your opponents help
you with the transportation.

The bidding deserves some com-
mentary. One club showed 17 or
more points in the Schenker sys-
tem, which North and South played.
it is an artificial bid and forcing.
East made a weak jump overcall of
two diamonds. However, he should
have had six diamonds to make this
bid,“ but East was a player with a
reputation for fudging his bids.

South could not double-two dia-

Dmonds because in the Schenker sys-
tem, he would have shown nine points
and said nothing about diamonds as
the double is also an artificial bid.
Therefore, he had to make awaiting
pass. West's two hearts was natural,
as was North’s two spades,

South now bid two no-trump, show-
inr,r 7 or 8 points and stoppers, in
both his opponent’s suits. North
rightly carried on to three no-trump.

The heart five went to East'sklng
and a small spade was returned.

South played the jack, West the

queen, and North the king. Declarer
led a club to his king, unblockingthe
suit. He then led his small spade,
intending to finesse the eight. But
West showed up with the ten which
was taken by North’s ace. He then
cashed the nine of spades, West
pitching a heart.

Declarer must not casll the eight
of spades as it sets up a trick for
East’s seven spot. lie now led a
diamond and when East played low,
finessed the seven as West showed
out, pitching a club.

South led the queen of hearts which
West took with the ace, East pitching
a spade. West should hold up with
the ace, however, as it puts South in
a bind. He must either lead hearts
into West’s ten or lead diamonds into
East.

After taking the ace of hearts,
West led a small club and declarer
finessed dummy's jack, leaving the
following position:

8- 8

Declarer cashed the eight of

spades, and threw a diamond from
his hand, West pitching a heart. lie
now played the ace and another club,
putting West in with the queen of
clubs and West now had to lead from
his 10-8 of hearts into South’s J-9,
giving declarer ten tricks.

Notice that if \Vest pitches the
ten of clubs on the eight of spades,
leaving his queen to fall underdum-
my’s ace, declarer will make an
extra trick in clubs, but West will
not be endpiayed and declarer will
have to lead the K—4 of diamonds
into East’s A-Q, holding himself
to 9 tricks.

On the television screen appears
a young woman singing and strum-
ming a guitar;

“This is Judy Collins, the song
‘Mr. Tarnborine Man,’ the composer
Bob Dylan," in tones the announcer,
beginning ABC News' “The Song-
makers" last Friday night.

The program dealt with contem-
porary writers, performers, and
their evolvement in the scope of
today's popular music. From the
folk and folk-rock world Judy Col-
lins, Tom Paxton, Simon and Gar-
funkle, the Paul Butterfield Blues
Band, The Blues Project, and var-
ious little known blues artists ap-
peared briefly.

Such groups as the Birds and The
Mammas and the Pappns, who seen
to defy pigeon-holing into the cur-
rent musical categories were seen.

Also appearing were Dione War»
wick, Smokey Robinson, and the
Miracles, representing the more
mid-stream aspects of today's mu-
sic.

Basic Ideas

The basic idea of the program
seemed to be to justify and ration-
alize what might seem to the older
generations to be onlyinharmonious
cacaphonous amalgamations of rhy-
thms, melodies, and incomprehen-
sible lyrics.

The show, aimed at this group,
used more familiar song—writers
as Henry Mancini and Johnny Mer-
cer to act as mediators, discussing
their own thoughts on the current
trends in sound.

A highlight of the program was

the discussion of the evolution of
"Chicago Blites,". starting with the
displaced negro blues and gospel
singers from the South, and br

up-to-date by groups like The Paul
Butterfleid Blues Band, (reviewed
last week), and the Blues Project.

An interesting point which was
discussed was the many facets of
blues. They can be sad, happy, or
a variety of other moods, because
to the blues, the music must ex-
press a deep-felt emotion.

For-Rooclling Evolution

To illustrate how far reaching
this evolution of blues has gone,
the show closed with The Blues
Project, performing a number en-
titled "Flute Thing." This song,
off their latest LP “Projectives,”
makes use of an electronified flute,
hooked up to an amplifier so that
the instruments range is broadened.

Some of the sounds emitted are
unbelievable and at times border on
the fields of electronic music, which
is currently being developed by many
of the more serious composers. in
this number, which would more
properly be labeled jazz rather than
folk blues, the rest oi the group
plays in a studied understatement
which includes a toned down drum
solo played with muted mallets.

Mommas and Pappos
Also interesting was the portion
on the Mammas and the Pappas in
which they are seen developing a
song entitled "Boys and Girls"
from the raw product to the finished

Examining produce in an open-air marketplace in Lisbon is one way to broaden one's knowl-
edge of the ways of the Portuguese people. These girls found exploring the markets of cities around
