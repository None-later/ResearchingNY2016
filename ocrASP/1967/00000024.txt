l Ileclaration

The following may be taken as The
Declaration of Independence of the Al-
bany Student Press. The ASP has al-
ways tried to serve the student body to
the best of its ability; this tradition is
being upheld this year. despite the ef-
forts of a small minorityof our students.

As stated in the last issue. we have
no desire to become abattleground for
the low grade political commotion that
is beginning to characterize this cam-
pus. As far as we are concerned, too
much of Tuesday’s issue was devoted to
the elections.

The listing of the complete “qualifi-
cations” of 21 MYSKANIA candidates
would have been unbearable.

Despite the importance of the elec-
tions other events are occurringon cam—
pus. Traditionally, no more than 10—15%
of this campus votes in any election.
and the number of those who vote upon
the basis of qualification rather than
personal bias like Greek affiliation does
not merit the amount of space needed to
list qualifications.

The fact of precedent does not bind
us to policy. The informal motto of this
University is “a campus in transition”
which means that any outmoded tra-
~ dition of a small high schoolish teach-

that without

the manner

STONES' CAVERNS-Now Campus Tourist Attraction
er’s college is to be discarded.

 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

 
  
  
 
 
 

In addition. no-one. including the do
nothing group that makes up this year’s
MYSKANIA, has any idea of the duties
of the body, besides such nebulous pow—
ers as' “to provide for the continuity of
meaningful tradition.” What good are
qualifications if we don’t know exactly
what we are electing these people to?

These lists of “qualifications” are in
reality a list of the clubs a person tells
Election Commission that he has be-
longed to. They really tell very little.
and no attempt is made to check on their
accuracy. Perhaps if MY SKANIA took it
upon themselves to distribute these lists,
instead of relying upon election commis-
sion and the ASP. they could create for
themselves at least one positive purpose
for their organization.

We always welcome constructive criti-
cism from any source, and we realize

the cooperation from the

entire University we could never gather
the information necessary to be an in—
formative newspaper. We welcome sug-
gestions for stories, and news tips of
upcoming events. but we reserve the
right to evalauate this information in
the manner we see fit, to present it in

which will best serve the

University’s needs.

We, the undersigned, candidates
for the body of MYSKANIA, feel that
an injustice has been done, not only
to each one of us as individuals,
but also to the entire student body,
by the position taken by theedltorial
staff of the Albany Student Press in
regard to the current elections.

in past years a precedent of pub-‘

lishing the activities and cumulative
averages (if so desired) of all MYS-
KANIA applicants has been estab-
lished by the ASP. it is a precedent

, which the current staff has chosen

to ignore, and in so doing has failed

in its duty to the student body.

As a publicly supported news

medium, the ASP has a responsi-

bility to provide all available in-

formation which might possibly lead

to more informed, intelligent voting.

That a need for such information

exists is amply demonstrated by the

fact that not even all of the candi-

dates are aware of each other’s

qualifications; what, then, might be

the case among those less familiar
with the University community?

. We therefore protest the editor-

ial decision not to publish informa-

tion provided by the candidates on

their applications as a gross failure

of public duty and abuse of general

welfare.

Love?

To the Editors:

Love is wonderful. Like a sacra-
ment, sex is an “outward and vis-
ible sign of an inward and spiritual
grace."

Public displays of affection (PDA)
are definitely outward and visible.
To those of you who are guilty of
this, i can only say that you are the
main attraction and object of scorn
to many of your fellow students.

‘ Kissing your date good night is as

old as Adam and Eve; coming just
short of copulation in the FlagRoom
while waiting for the dinner line to
open is not.

Ann Landers defines necking as
“an exchange of kisses and hugs,
keeping the feet on the floor, and all
hands on deck." While Anne Lenders
is not exactly the standard for col-
lege students, her advice in this
instance should be applied. I do not
think that any student at State is
prudlsh enough to object to necking
as Miss Landers defines it.

However, public petting is a dif-
ferent story. We are all aware that
one fraternity on campus has a

l‘rldoy,

even they cannot be accused ofdoing
what one student does from time to
time in the Colonial Flag Room.
Miss Lenders defines petting as
“kissing and hugging, plus wander-
ing hands, with one or both parties
reclining, and getting altogether too
comfortable for anyone’s good."

The parties may be comfortable,
but those who witness displays are
not. What a couple does in private
is their own'business; what they do
in public is everyone's.

We are supposed to be adults.
Why then doesn't someone work up
thecourage to censor the public
petters before the University does?

intervention Attacked

To the Editor:

In this world there are many '

misinformed or downright ignorant
people. Friday afternoon we Rus-
sell Sage students witnessedasmail
representative assemblage of these
people on our campus.

These people were not Russell
Sage students but members of a
citizens’ committee and students of
various colleges.

During the past week there had
been rumors about a demonstra-
tion on the Russell-Sage campus
for academic freedom and in pro-
test of the “firing” of the instruc-
tors, Mr. Bunch, Mr. Delonas, Mr.
Larrick, and Mr. Arey.

It was stated that Russell Sage
needed "help" and “Lewis” had
done a “bad Thing.” Such nonsense
is really a laughing matter. Russell
Sage does not need “help;" we have
a perfectly competent administra-
tion, faculty, student government,
and student body to take care of our
problems when and if they should
arise. Sage does have academic
freedom. When an agreement is
not upheld by both parties involved,
there is no reason for a contract

  

JICOMMUNI’CA TIONS’ " °

‘ somewhat dubious reputation. But,

to be renewed. This was the case 0

with the above mentioned instruc-
tors.

Most college presidents want the
members of their faculty to be pro-
perly qualified to teach their cour-
ses; if they are not, it is the pre-
rogative of the president not to re-
new their contracts in hopes of find-
ing the kind of instructors he wishes.

This is not a loss of anyone’s
academic freedom, but rather‘an
attempt to uphold academic excel-
lence. Such a period of probation
always precedes the honor of tenure.

if there had been a reason for a
demonstration, Sage is responsible
enough to take care of itself without
help.

A suggestion for those who par-
ticipated in the "demonstration:"
before you come to Sage again, wait
until you're invited, or at least find
out the facts and the truth of the
matter.

Thanks for the show. '

The Swiss inn Is presently featur-
ing two bands, The Nomads and The
Pawns. it is very apparent, however,
that quantity, in this case, does not
make up for quality.

The Nomads, definitely the better
of the two, have been together for
four years touring upstate New York.
Playing hard rock and roll, they feel,
as the drummer Peter Howard
pointed out, that their main line is
rhythm and blues; meaning (by their
definition) Wilson Pickett and James
Brown numbers.

The Nomads' talent could be rated
as average. One factor of the No-
mads effectiveness at the Swiss inn
is their playing to various stage
lights. The vibrant shadows which
are cast- on the ceiling and walls,
are attention getters if the band
itself is not.

When questioned as to the impor-
tance of Showmanship vs. talent,
the drummer replied: “Both, you
can’t have one without the other if
you want a successful band." Iron-
ically The Nomads are lacking in
the Showmanship ingredient of their
success formula.

if The Nomads were lacking in
showmanship, The Pawns were
lacking in both assets necessary
for a successful band. Their pitiful
renderings of their “hit parade
songs" may be partially accounted
for because they have been together
only eight months. Hopefully their
crude, choppy verions of Monkees
hits and their inharmonious attempts
at the McCoy's "Hang on Sloopy"
will improve with experience.

These two bands’ versions of
"popular" songs (1950’s “Shake a
Hand" and "Yeah, yeah Rock and
Roll") may be adequate to satisfy
the groupies of the Swiss inn, but
these songs and the bands' abilities
in general can hardly classify them
as popular bands of 1967.

‘Funeral In Berlin’ Seen

As Slick Spy Film

by Douglas Rathgeb

That super—sexy,

super-crafty,

super-insolent

Cockney secret agent with the dark-rimmed glasses
is at it again. Harry Palmer. or rather the inde-
structible Michael Caine. is once again up to his ears
in murder. intrigue, espionage, double—crosses and
love-making (not necessarily in that order) in Harry

Saltzman’ s production
“Funeral in Berlin" adap-
ted from the Len Deighton
best-seller. And, needless
to say, everything comes
off in grand style.

Latest Escapade

And certainly this latest escapade
is no less intelligent, no less suc-
cessful and no lesa entertaining.

Beautifully paved, expertly plotted
packed with excitement of the most
subtle variety and handsomely
mounted‘ In color, “Funeral” is as
slick a spy film as one could hope
for.

Like “lpcress,” it is more blood-
and-guts than tongue-in-cheek. llap-
plly, it has none of the foolish, and
at times annoying, bravado of the
Bond films, none of the lapses of
creditihillty, none of the hokum. it
is straight, solid, crisp espionage,
for those that really like it that way.

Jigsaw-Puzzle Plot

A jigsaw-puzzle plot concerninga
plan to smuggle an East German who
desires to escape to the West over
the Berlin Wall is more than enough
to keep your mind occupied for the
course of the film.

The direction, by Guy Hamilton,
is well up to par with that of “1p-
cress File," which was nothingless
than superb.

But perhaps the film’s greatest
asset is Britain’s Michael Cains,
looking very much at home as the
Harry Palmer character he created
In “lpcress.”

Of all the parts Calnc has played
to date, including Alfie, this is still
the one he is best at. lie is the per-
fect poor man's spy, the reluctant
secret agent who relies on his wits
to keep him alive In adii'iy business.

Classy But Not Outlondish
He has a way of looking classy,
but not outlandish, sexy, but not
decadent. China is presently work-
ing on the third film in the Harry
Palmer series, Len Deighton's very

popular "Billion Dollar Brain."
And unless something Goes des-

 

 

perately wrong with the formula that
has produced both "The lpcress
File" and “Funeral in Berlin,”
simply refer back to this review
when you’re deciding if you want
to see it or not.

Note: Also playing with “Funer-
al” in many theatres was “Red
Tomahawk," and A. C. Lyles wes-
tern. if you want to see one of the
most unintentionally funny fiascos
ever recorded on film, you simply
have to see this mess.

in anticipation of the last}?

propriate concert decorum. and then never mention
the problem of behavior again. Audience reaction to
several concerts earlier this year seemed to indicate.

that the days of applaudin

,The- natural

which is always felt be-
tween the movements of a
composition was properly
being focused on the music
yet to come, rather thanon
the fearful questions “will
they applaud?” or“why did

they?”

A true concert atmosphere was
descending on Page Hall and being
absorbed by the audience; it was
a healthy and most welcome pre-
sence. But the mass-insecurity, no-
toriously demonstrated by past Page
audiences again made itself unfor-
tunately audible during the perfor-
mance.

Modern Listeners

it sometimes seems phy’slcally
impossible for modern listeners,
weaned on the brief musical offer-
ings of Lawrence Welk and high
school concert bands, to remain
mute while the brief seconds be-
tween movements elapse. The aud-
ience is embarassed by silence; it
feels It must reassure the perfor-
mer, reassert that it is, Indeed,
still there and still listening.

That the audience is “stillthere”
has never been doubted by those
on stage; that it is “still listening"
remains a question to be answered.
it will, undoubtedly, be argued that
insistance on this formality of re-
straint is a bit priggish, and that
spontaneous appreciation is, itself,
to be cheered.

CARNIVAL, IT"! '67 University Revue is
for their April 20-22 performances.

g between movements were

tension an attempt to kowtow to social pro-

priety, such an argument is surely
reasonable. But the break between
movements is a silence full of just-
experienced sounds, as well asex-
pectations about those sounds still
to be heard.

Such a silence should be a mean-

ingful contribution to the total musi-
cal experience. The tension set up
by a silence between movements is
harmonically important and should,
correspondingly, be preserved as
an aesthetic necessity.

in spite of the musical sophistica-
tion which had been developing, and
in spite of forthright sdmonitions de-
livered to many students who would
be present, last week's audience
succumbed to the old ways.

Reasons for Capitulation
The reasons for this capituiation
are not, however, completely un-
justifiable. The substantial pause,
taken by the performers after the
opening movement on every pro-

gram to allow late comers to enter,
brings up the question of applause,
especially when the performerlooks
out over the audience as liexpecting
a response.

Although he probably seeks only
to recapture the listeners' attention,
the gaze too often elicits the un-
wanted response. it ls,unspeakably
difficult to refrain from partici-
pating once the racket has begun.
One is, to be sure, eager to respond
and to approve.

Audience Misinterpretatlan
To this, If such considerations
matter, is added the thought that
others in the audience will misin-
terpret this stoic restraint as an
unfavorable comment on the quality
of the performance. But there is no
permanent stigma attached to being
a late clapper, and, if the silence is
long enough, the performers will
surely make it clear to the aud-

ience when they have finished.

More explicit program notes, per-
haps even translations of the tempo
indications for each movement,and,
what Is primarily essential, and at-
tentive awareness on the part of
each listener will help to create the
conditions for an emotionally suc-
cessful concert experience. Let us
hope that such an awareness will
not be long in coming to our aud-
fences.
