Budgau
All organization: presidents can
pick up a copy of the Central Coun-
cil Budget Procedure Bill in Student.
Mail Boxes in the campus center.

The bill explains the required pro-
cedure to request a budget from
student association for 1067-68. All
budgets must be turned in to Com-
mission head under which the or-
ganization is instituted by March 10.

by Martin Sch Worn

Quite a few people around the
campus have become annoyed at my
vouts'poken claim that student gov-
ernment here is a stagnant, pig-
headed group as a whole. Unfor-
tunately, some people have inter-
preted this to mean that every single
person or group in any way con-
nected with Student Association is
‘ a do-nothing group. Obviously this
is not the case.

Central Council, however, proved
that it still can pass a major bill

 

'so, the blame for a lack of new faces
' in appointed pOsitions is now shifted

should continue to be the case.
' Bravol

A Real on Laurels

The question now centers on
whether or not Student Association
should rest on its laurels for the
next year, or whether two major
bills can be passed in the same
year. This year we have passed
from the old Senate tradition oflotal
apathy and meticulous nit-picklngto
a highly active and hard working
Student Association chasing its own
tail. ‘

Still being, as we are, inastate of
transition, it is the place ofour stu-
dent government to begin our new
traditions by taking positive steps.
Some disposition of MYSKANIA,
either to define it or discard it,
must be madeimmedialelereaiize
that Camp Board is working on Dip-
pikill plans, but this work is in its
eleventh year. Some decision as to
its disposition shouldbe made before
June.

An Interesting Note
It is interesting to note that with
1/60th the amount of money that
Student Association has put away
for Dippikiil about $20,000 has been
spent. What do we have for $80,000?
A damn white elephant forest] This

I' liver In counter Intelligence 1

A! one issue we can’t keep avoiding.

We can't afford a football team,
but student Association has enough
money stored away with Athletic
Board to sign Steve Spurrier for
three years. Perhaps some of this
money could be used instead of cut-
ting everyone's budget as happened
this year.

Anoilicr Suggestion

With no bulletin board space and
no room in the ASP there is no
possible way that students can vote
for anyone on any basis but his
smile and Greek affiliation, we need
an outlet for campaigning, such as
running on tickets or public forums.
We are no longer Albany Normal,
where most students know the 300-
400 others in his class.

Despite being informed that Vice-
President Thorne had serious doubts
about the future of the LAAC pro-
posal for more liberal regulations
on women when it reached his Stu-
dent Affairs Committee, unless it
had Central Council approval, that
August body decided to do nothing:
ironically, they were probably un-
animously in favor of the proposal.
Let's hope for the best.

Siudent'government here reminds
me of an old Mack Sennett Chase
scene. The actors would run in place
as fast as they could while the
scenery rolled by. The illusion,
though, was that the opposite was
taking place. .

Central Council and some of the
Commissions are workinglike crazy
to keep from sliding backward. it is
time that we went forward a little.

in anticipation, it is entirely fai-
acious to assume that only those
connected with student government
can appreciate its workings.lnslead
of spending so much energy trying
to defend a system that encourages
nit-picking and stagnancy, and a
group of students who rarely can run
forward without Dr. Tucker or Dr.
Kendall goading them on, perhaps
we can see Central Council begin to
attack a few of the problems they
have been avoiding for so long.

I COMMUNICA TIONS

.
Cooperation Urged
To the Editor:

Although the various campuses in
the area are geographically close,
they are sadly segregated.Hecently,
a group of students from Albany
State, the Junior College in Albany,
RP], and Russell Sage, have formed
into the Trl-Clty Student Alliance.

This is an organization which
hopes to provide the much needed
link for contact and cooperation
among the colleges in the area.
Our organization was initially
sparked by the dismissal of George
Bunch, a sociology instructor at
the Junior College of Albany and
former faculty member at Russell
Sage.

At an organizational meeting last
week, a constitution was drafted
which will serve as a guideline for
the necessary coordination of indi-
vidual campus activities. We hope
to be the organ through which ALL
can come to exchange ideas, voice
and compare problems, and perhaps
resolve solutions.

The alliance hopes to sponsor
debates, forums, and tench-ins on
current issues whether they be 10-
cal, state or national. Our speakers
will be local leaders, clergy, legis-

lators, professors as well as stu-
dents, since we wish to promote
increased interaction among stu-
dents, faculty and community.

To fill the existing communica-
tion vacuum among the colleges, a
Tri-City Newsletter will be circu-
lated. This will inform all the cam-

'puses of various films, speakers and
other activities taking place in the
Tri-Clties.

The alliance also hopes toiniiiale
a tutorial program for children in

deprived areas by cooperating with
existing programs of this sort.

Our next meeting, which is open,
will be held onMarchilat 669 Myrtle
Avenue, near the State Campus at
7:30 p.m. if you desire to become
more aware of the intellectual and
cultural opportunities available to
you in this area, and are anxious
to meet and discuss with your fel-
low students, come to our next
meeting.

For further information, direc-
tions or transportation contact Len
Rein at 489-1240.

ied for two years at the American

Academy To Show Film
With Unwanted Child Theme

Tonight’s feature of the American
Film Academy is a French film,
"400 Blows,” which will be shown
at 7:30 p.m. in Draper 349.

The film, the sixth in the Acad-
emy’s Spring schedule, will be pre-
ceded by a short, and is a product
of the New Wave French director
Francois Truffaut.

“400 Blows" is an unusually-
executed film on the theme of the
unwanted child. in reaction to the
world’s indifference, if not hostil-
ity, the boy behaves badly and even—
tually justifies the actions of those
who would like to be rid of him.

The actors’ Woes are

naturalistic, and the boy is played
by Jean-PierrerLeaud. Claire Maur-
ier is convincing, as the boy’s
mo.her - torn between maternal af-
fection and a vague regret that he
exists.

Trauffaut has maintained natural-
ism by filming street scenes with
concealed cameras so that the ac-
tors are surrounded by real “ex-
tras.”

Aesthetic limitations such as
these are the hallmark of this young
French director. It is often sug-
gested that his films are merely
cinematic reﬂections of the am-
biguity of the real world.
