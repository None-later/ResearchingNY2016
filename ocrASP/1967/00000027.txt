Sextet Goes Down,
long Season Ends

The Albany State women's basket-
ball team ended iis winless season
last week with three losses to the
female hoopsters from Castleton
College and Oneonta State.

In Wednesday’s game, the Albany
women fell by ascore oi45-37. Puc-
ing the losers wereifaren Miller and
Jean Herrick, who both chipped in
with fourteen points.

Women Conclude Season
At Oneonta on Friday, the results
were much the same. Again, Albany
was on the losing end, this time on
the bottom of a 52-10 score. The
end of a disappointing season finally
arrived when the Albany women
struggled through a 30-28 loss to
the Oneonta females. The high
scorer once again was mainstay
‘ Miller, who chipped in with eleven
points. Miss Miller finished the sea-
son as the team's high scorer with
a steady eight point average per
game,

Swari, who captained the women's

department who piloted the team.

a 7-4-2 overall slate.

Springer’s loss was followed by a
fluke pin by the Red Dragon's John
Muledo over Frank Berry at 4:30.
For all. intents and purposes the
match was over. Berry, also a
sophomore, was 7-4 on the season.

Senior captain Art Recesso was
then decisioned 10-5 by Cortland's
Mike Tully, making Art’s record a
very respectiable 9-4. Roger Gor-
ham also fell by decision to make
his overall record 8-4, and Chat
Krom was pinned in 4:05 in the
heavyweight division to bring about
the final score of 27-8.

Elﬁn Winning Wrestlers

The Albany matmen finished‘the
season with seven wrestlers who
had overall records of .500 or bet-
ter. Crow finished with a 13-0 mark
and 8 pints, and Palmer, Recesso,
Gotham, Springer, and Berry are
jointed by Bill Russell who was 6-4.

Three of these will be leaving for
the NCAA college division cham-
pionships on Thursday. Crowwillbe
going as defending champion at 123,
and it is hoped that he will be able
to repeat there and go on to the Uni-
versity division. Palmer, another
senior, will probably be wrestling
at 137, and Springer, a sophomore,
who has been wrestling above his
normal weight class all season will
be going at 145.

The CAMFs virtually clinched the League I cham-
pionship by nipping the men from APA Thursday night
in a 51-50 cliffhanger. With a two game lead over
second place APA and only two games remaining, the
CAMFs can do no worse than a tie, needing only a
victory over KB or the Save to take full claim to the
title.

APA jumped off to an early 6-2
lead, but the CAMFs soon caught
up and led throughout the rest of
the game until a twisting lay-up
by APA's Ken Zacharias knotted
the score at 50 all with less than a

Hours Proposal IIOVi
Awaiting Approval . ,
0i University Counsel.

0 The long awaited wo-
men’s hours proposal is
presently awaiting action
on the last approval nec-
essary before the proposal
becomes University policy.

The Proposal was given
to President Collins Mon-
day afternoon after receiv-
ing the unanimous approval
3f the Faculty Senate.

The proposal, which was pre-
Canted to the Senate for viewing
before the meeting, was passed
without discussion in a vote which
took only a few minutes.

The proposal must now receive
approval from the University Coun—
sel, the University’s legal adviser,
and President Collins will present
it to the Counsel at the next meet-
ing which will be held in April.

In the meantime the Administra-
tion will be working on the mechan-
ics of putting the system into ef-
fect.

According to Dr. Clifton Thorns,
vice president for Student Affairs,
there is no reason why the proposal

.annot be put into effect later in the
semester providing the mechanics
of the system can be worked out ef-
fectlvely.

Written by LAAC

The proposal, which was written

up by the Living Area Affairs Com-

mission, was presented to the Stu-
dent Affairs Council after being

presented to Central Council Feb. 9

and was accepted almost in toto by

the Student Affairs Council; the only
changes being to further liberalize
the LAAC proposal.

The liberalizations which the
.Councll recommended were re-
ferred back to LAAC who approved
them.

The original proposal, which
called for compulsory sign-out in
a sealed envelope, which was to be
opened only in case of emergency,
has been changed to allow girls the
option of filing a sealed envelope or
to sign out in the usual way.

Another change was suggested
in the need for written permission
of parents for a freshman to sign
out for the weekend. The new change
makes all written weekend permis-
sions unnecessary.

. Further Liberolizations

The Council also suggested fur—
ther liberalization of the fresh wo-
men's hours, which would move
sign in tithes from 11 p.m. week-
days, and 2 a.m. on Fridays and
Saturdays, to 12 midnight on week-
days, and 3 a.m. on Fri. and Sat.

Committee To End War To Offer
Workshops 0n Vietnam History.

The Student—Faculty committee to end the war in Vietnam-will offer workshops
concerning the history of the Vietnam, beginning this Monday, March 13. The intro-
ductory workshop will be offered six times during the first week in order to give

interested students a choice of times in which to attend.

The workshops will be conducted by teams of students who have done a consid-
erable amount of research on the war. The committee stated the workshops will

not try to present one point
of view. but will try to
center discussion around
some of the relevant ques—
tions relating to the war.

nized as a supreme directorial ef-
fort. It appears consistently on crit-
ics’ lists of “ten best" films, and
some feel it to be the finest film
of all time.

In this picture Eisenstein largely
abandoned the shock-ruiting mun-
tage style which made him famous,
for a more lheatl‘lcul but no less
intense manner of cinematic pre-
sentation.

in this style, the acting is forced
to carry :1 large burden of signifi-
cance, and Eisenstein caused much
furor by placing incredibledemands
on the actors--partlculariy Nikolai:
Cherkaasov, who after playing Ivan,
had to be hospitalized for several
months.

The result is a stunning and pow-
erful film. not "realistic" in the
narrow sense but operatic and ex-
pansiver magnificent, the effect

heightened by some of the most

beautiful cinematography ever seen.

“Ivan the Terrible" was made in
two parts, both of which will be shown
by the IFG. Due to the great length
involved, it will be presented both
Friday and Saturday, complete each

After the first week of workshops
reading will be encouraged on spe-
cific topics. Students will be able to
purchase an anthology of documents
on the war from which readings may
be assigned; they will also receive a
bibliography of books, newspaper
stories, and magazine articles,
which can be found in the University
Library.

Committee Encourages

The committee encourages those
who wish to defend a certain View
of the war to attend. However, they
expressed hope that students who
have not yet formed an opinion or
who are open to further investiga-
tion of the issues, would be attracted
by the workshops.

The workshops will continue to
meet weekly after the introductory
sessions under the guidance of their
discussion leaders. Students are en-
couraged to attend the same ses-
sion each week so that the continuity
of investigation can be maintained.

The committee also expressed
hope that these workshops will en-
courage students to take a more
active interest in the course of the
war. In particular, they can lead
to an active debate on campus, pre-
ceding the student government ref-
erendum on the war.

Workshop Schedule

The schedule for the workshops
is Monday 7:00--iiumaniiies 110,
Tuesday 3:45-Studeni Center 367,
Wednesday 7:00--liumanlties 112,
Thursday 3:45 —- llumanlties 128,
Saturday 3:45 -- Humanities 129,
Sunday 7:00 -- Humanities 123.

The workshops are only one as-
pect of the activities planned by the
committee. Others are mentioned in
the rationale presented to the stu-
dent body by the committee in a
newsletter last Monday. The ration-
ale states:

A committee to end the war in
Vietnam has been formed byagroup
of students and faculty of the uni-
versliy in order to make the uni-
versity community aware of the war
and its disastrous effects upon all
of us.

The committee hopes to promote

 

discussion, controversy, and thought
about current world affairs, par-
ticularly about United States in-
volvement in Southeast Asia, with-
in all segments of the university
community.

‘ Since we feel that our govern-
ment and the mass media have
limited and distorted the news about
the war, we find it all the more
cruoial that information about the
war be made available to the Amer-
ican people in general, and to this
university in particular.

‘ To this end, we intend to offer
information on the war through
workshops, through this newsletter,
and through a program of speakers
and films which will encompass all
sides of the debate on Vietnam.

Definite Stand
“This committee is committed to
a definite stand. It believes that
American participation in the war
is unjustified, immoral, and crim-
inal. However, we feel that the cause
of truth is best served by free dis-
cussion which considers all points
of view.
“Therefore, we hope that our ac-
tivities will stimulate members of
the university community, hereto-
fore silent, to express their views
on the war in Vietnam."
