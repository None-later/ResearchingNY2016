Atmospheric Science Dept. Receives
$15,000 In G.E. Foundation Grants

11 r

The n-‘ ‘ it Re-
search Center at State University
of New York at Albany has received
grants totaling $15,000 from the
General Electric Foundation andthe
General Electric Company.

The grants will be used to sup-
port the ASRC in its fundamental
studies of atmospheric physics re-
lating to nucleation, precipitation,
and air and water pollution.

Presentation of the awards was
made by Dr. Arthur M. Bueche,
GE vice president in charge of the
company's research and develop-
ment center in Schenectady, and
Donald E. Craig, vice president and
gene al manager of the power gen-
erat on division. Accepting the
grants in behalf of the University
was Dr. Earl G. Droessler, vice-
president for research.

Headed by Shooter
ASRC is headed by Dr. Vincent
J. Schaefer, who has been involved
in atmospheric research since the
1940’s. Working with Dr. Irving

I ‘ , the Nobel Laureate, at
the General Electric Research Lab-
oratory, Dr. Schaefer created the
first man-made snowstorm by seed-
ing clouds with dry ice in 1946.

Associated with Dr. Schaefer at
ASRC are Dr. Bernard Vonnegut and
Ray Falconer, both of whom are
former GE Research Laboratory
employees. Shortly after Dr. Schae-
fer successfully seeded a cloud with
dry ice, Dr. Vonnegut demonstrated
that silver iodide was an effective
chemical for cloud-seeding experi-
ments. Both Dr. Vonnegut and Mr.
Falconer were present at the awards
presentation.

. Various Grants

The grants included $5,000 from
the GE foundation and $10,000 from
the company. The foundation, an in-
dependent trust established by the
company in 1952, supported ASRC's
work in 1966 when it arranged to
have transferred to the center two
unique mobile laboratories for air
particle studies.

Guuld Invites Student leaders
in form lnter-llnit Cabinet

Samuel B. Gould, Chancellor of
the State University of New York,
delivered an address at the meet-
ing of Student Government presi-
dents in Albany, Feb. 27. Through-
out the speech he listed areas of
action to be taken by the University
and then proposed that a cabinet be
established to investigate his pro-
posed plans.

After the speech a cabinet was
formed. it is composed of 6 presi-
dents of student governments. Rep-
resentatives are from State Univer-
sity College at New Paltz, State
University College at Plattsburgh,
Morrisville Agricultural and Tech-
nical' Institute, Dutchess County
Community College and State Unl-
verslty College at Buffalo.

Representing the University cen- ‘

ters is William Cleveland, SUNYA
Student Association President. This
cabinet or steering committee was
formed for the purpose of serving
as a sounding board for student
opinion within the State University
of New York.

Since the steering committee was
formed it has met March 3 to dis-
cuss some of the ideas presented in
Gould's speech. One of the most
important matters according to
Cleveland in that of University Fel-
lows.

During the month of July, 12 stu-
dents from the State University of
New York wiiiparticipata in drafting
plans for a new university to be as-
tahlished in Old Westbury, Long is-
iand. These fellowships to be
awarded to undergraduates will con.
stat of $500 in addition to expenses.

The students to participate iuthls
program will be required to submit

a paper describing the physical plans
of the new university, the curricu-
lum and other specific areas.

The cabinet is still setting up the
details of the method of selection but
the paper will be one of the major
ways of judging the candidate.

Any students who may be inter-
ested in this program should contact
William Cleveland in the Student
Association Office, room 361,Cam-
pus Center.

'ident Collins and Dr. ll. Toigo of

sics may be used in support of re-
search on atmospheric aerosols re-
lated to air and water pollution.

Also in attendance at the presen-
tation of the grants were Dr. John
K. Wolfe, consultant to GE’s educa-
tional relations; Dr. Eugene H. Mc-
Laren, chairman of the University's
division of science and mathematics;
and Dr. D. Kenneth Baker, manager
of professional personnel and Uni-
versity relations for GE's R & D
center.

‘v 0n Summer loos Abroad

Due to the fact that many students,
in their investigation of literature
about travel abroad have come
across agencies who profess to find
overseas jobs, the Student Ambassa-
dor Committee has presented some
considerations -as to what to look
for when investigating work oppor-
tunities abroad. 4

The Committee is well aware
that working overseas offersamore
meaningful experience than the usual
tourist approach to travel. it pro-
vides an opportunity to work side
by side with nationals ofapartlcular
country and thereby to learn much
more about the people. The oppor-
tunity for intensive practice andim-
provement of one’s forelgnlanguage
skills is another appealing advan-
tage.

However, the Student Ambassador
Committee feels that many other
considerations must be taken into
'ccount. Dear to any student’s heart

5 the matter of money. Since most
rgencies assisting in employment
nave requirements of fees or de-
posits, how do these compare with
other agencies offering similar
services?

Under what conditions will fees
or deposits be refunded? Do they
offer advantages for low-cost
travel. How do the wages and work-
ing conditions compare with the cost.
of living for a given location?

in addition, information regarding
the types of jobs available shouldbe
thoroughly investigated. What are
the working hours and probable
time-off? is the agency primarily
concerned with student employment
or is it more concerned with sched-
uling tours before, during or after
the work periods?

Also, are the tours optional or
is participation required? Does the
agency conduct orientation sessions
to give you a well-informed back-
ground as to the working conditions
in your specific location? Will they
provide names or students from

your campus who have participated
in order that you may get first-
hand information.

The' Student Ambassador Com-
mittee views foreign travel as an
investment, as do most students.
As such, it should be planned f
maximum return of learning al’
experience for the amount of money
and time spent. 1 .

The Committee, with the cooper-
ation of Mr. Peter Betz of the Li-
brary Staff, has arranged to have a
bibliography of work, study and
travel abroad data available at the
information Desk of the University
Library. Students and faculty are
welcome to use the resources.

'Why Not Ilropout?’
Tonight’s Eye lupin e

Tonight’s Golden Eye Program
will be “The Student Today-Why Not
Drop Out?", and will feature discus-
sion of a student panel with Dr.
Harry Staley acting as moderator.

Members of the panel willinclude
Fred Childs, John Fleitman, Nancy
Papish, and James Stewart, all stu-
dents presently enrolled ln the Uni-
versity.

Staley will open the program with
a discussion on the various aspects
of the university throughout history,
and will speak on the ideas of arm -
versity as propounded by John He
ry Newman and Paul Goodman.

Stewart will enlarge on the
changing roles of the student and
the university with a special con-
centration on the loco parentis con-
cept.

Miss Papish will present views
on' student identity and how it is
affected by increased specialization.

Childs will talk on the concept of
the intellectual elite as contrasted
between American and other so-
cieties, especially German.

Intro-Stoioﬁnoy
j lists Classics Courses

“New York State Programs in
Classics," a ﬁll-page survey of
classics programs offered _at the
undergraduate level by colleges and
universities in New York State, has
been published by the University.
The booklet was preparedby the
research committee of The Classi-
cal Association of the Empire State
with the support of the University.

Mrs. Harriet S; Norton,assoclate
professor of education and chairman
of Latin education in the university's
school of education, is chairman of
the committee.- Other committee
members are James B. Colton,
chairman of the language department
at Albany Academy for Boys, and
Dr. Hans A. Pohlsander, and Rich-
ard Gascoyne, both of the faculty
at the university.

Dr. Pohisander is associate pro-
fessor of classical and comparative
.iterature, and Mr. Gascoyne is
assistant professor of classics.

The booklet, reportedly the first
of its kind to have been published,
lists nearly '70 institutions of higher
learning in the state which offer
undergraduate programs in the clas-
sics. Copies are bei..g sent by the
Guidance Bureau of the New York
State Education Department to guid-
ance offices of every school in the
state.

Additionally, the research com-
mittee of CAES Associationis mail-
ing a copy to each member of the

.tssociatlon.

(ollirrs Receives
Policy On Alcohol

President Collins announced that
the alcohol policy which was sub-
mitted to Central Council Thurs.,
March 2, by the Committee to Draft
the University Alcohol Policy was

..lOW in his hands for approval, at
the President’s Conference, Mon-

day.

He stated the policy, which was
approved by the Student Affairs
Council after receiving Central
Council approvalThursday, was ac-
cepted in toto and that he felt it was
"very well thought out" and there
should be “no real difficulty" in
having the final handed down.

He stated he was considering a
few “minor points" in interpreta-
tion but no major changes to the
policy.

. Any future hold-up in actual avail-
ability of liquor on the campus will
probably arise in procuring a New
York State Liquor License for the
University.

This is often a long involved pro-
cess, and one which is further com-
plicated by determination ofthe type
of license which it is necessary to
obtain.

Clifton Thorpe, vice president for
Student Affairs, stated he would be
“surprised” to see the license ob-
tained in time for the opening of
the Fall '67 semester due to the
red tape involved in getting a li-

Icense.

Fourth Time Around 

by Igor Korololt

Eric Andersen, one of the best
romantic folksingers of the new-
wave composers, will be appearing
tomorrow at 8:00 p.m. at Gibbons
Hall, Siena College. In anticipation
of his concert, i believe a few brief
notes might be fitting.

Andersen is a New York State boy
hailing from suburban Buffalo. After
doing a brief stint _at Hobart College.
Geneva, he took the road of many of
our legendary folksinger-songwri-
ters and bummed to the West Coast
and back in order to do some "--
learning about music and about life.”

Early Breakthroughs

In the early winter of 1964 he
found a notable patron in Tom Pax-
ton after making the Village scene.
This gained him at the age oftwenty
engagements in some of the more
well-known coffee houses and a re-
cording contract with Vanguard.

To date he has released two al-
bums, "Today is the Highway" and
“ ‘Bout Changes and Things," which
was reviewad in last semester's
ASP. Of the multitude of songs he
has written his best known are pro-
bably “Violets of Dawn" and "Thir-
sty Boots" which have been recorded
by various artists ranging from Judy
Collins to The Blues Project.

Critics Acclalm
About Andersen’s songs Stacey

a world view--these are the ele-
ments that make Eric Andersen an
important new voice." -

According to Robert Shelton's re-
view in the "New York Times:

"his voice is a beautiful, vibrato-
thick light baritone that echoes the
styles of Tom Paxton and Bob Dy-
lan, and is occasionally reminiscent
of the softer side of Elvis Presley.
..." This is most evident on "To-
day is the Highway” but with the
release of " ‘Bout Changes and
Things” we find that he has me.-
tured, making known that although
he has borrowed, the resultingstyle
can only be Eric Andersen.

Tickets

As a free plug for the girls of
St. Rose, who are sponsoring the
concert, the tickets are $2.00 for'
general admission and $3.00 for re-
served seats. They can be obtained
at the St. Rose bookstore which is
open until noon tomorrow. if you've
got the money and are looking for
an enjoyable time, buy up a ticket
and l’m sure your evening won't
be wasted.

On March 10 representatives from
