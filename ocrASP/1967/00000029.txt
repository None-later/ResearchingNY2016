college .leletlnn in Be A First,
Hope To Receive National Coverage

“No University has ever at-
tempted to put on a teiethon before.
It is an experiment."

John Fotia first thought up this
"experiment." He approached Jeff
Mishkin, who originally thought the
idea was crazy. After discussing ii
to awhile, the plans became more
f asible, and Mlshkln said he’d-be
glad to help.

The next step was to have the idea
approved by Central Council. On
Oct. 27 the firstbiil to Central Coun-
cil was presented requesting ap-
proval and support of the teiethon.
After the bill was passed, an execu-
tive committee was formed.

Among the memberr. of the ex-
ecutive committee are John l’otia,
Jeff Mlshkin, Ray Cianfrinl, Bill
Cleveland, Dr. Clifton Thorne, Neil
Brown, Dr. Penn and Ed Lang.
Claude Price, Executive Director
of the New York State Association
for Mental llealth, also aided the
Board tremendously in its endeavor.

Ptoluct Real

John believes that while many
people in the University community
do a lot of talking, this project is
real, not talk. lie wants something
big to come out of the University,
to give it a bigger, better, and more
widespread name.

While speaking with Fotla,'Mlsh-
kin, and Ed Kramer, publicity man-

lRA MILLER, drummer in Lou Strong’s bend, sets up the

agar for the teiethon, about the

teiethon, John said it is "our idea,
but the University's project." He
wants everyone to be a part of the
project, help it and enjoy'it.

Everyone agrees that there is a
great educational value in working
on a project. John terms it as a
“Lesson in Life, not just studying.”
it is the type of experience, they
believe, which aids in assuming
adulthood.

Obvious Need

The need for something big to
come to Albany was evident. its
size and objectives require unifi-
cation, including student support,
rather than jusi one segment of
the campus community. The ex—
ecutive committee reports that any-
one they’ve asked has done some-
thing for the teiethon.

It is hoped that with the success
of this teiethon, future endeavors
will be easier to undertake and sup-
port wiil be more readily given. it
is possible that in the future greater
coverage, perhaps even nationwide
television, would be given to tele-
thons of this type.

The committee further hopes that

this type of project will spread to
other universities.

Strong and other participantr in the teiethon look on.

10-11 from 7 p.m. Friday to 5
Saturday evening. The event will
take place in the Campus Center
Ballroom.

Tickets for the Telethon be sold
at each Quad duringthedinner hours.
They will also be on sale in liu-
manitles 140 until Friday afternoon.
They will cost $1.50 to holders of
student tax cards, and at a cost of
$2.00 without.

Anyone buying a ticket will be
able to leave and comeback through-
out the entire 22—hour program.

Women's Hours Suspended

Miss Norma J. Edsall, Director
of Residence, has announced that
women's hours will be suspended
for the evening of March 10, Fri-
day, with the purchase of a ticket
for the Mental Health Telethon. The
Telethon will be presented from 7
p.m. Friday to 5 p.m. Saturday.

Miss Edsali announced that the
normal procedures for sign out will
be followed. These include the regu-
lar sign out, the closing of the rest-
dence unit at 1 a.m.and two students
on duty from 1 to 3 a.m. However,

Co-chairmen John Fotla and Jeff
Mlshkin emphasized that the Tele-
thon will be the “biggest experi-
ment the University has ever done.”
According to Fotia and Mishle the
Telethon will achieve a dual end:

to provide needed funds for New

York State’s number one health
problem-Mental Health and to dem-
onstrate to the surrounding com-
munity that the University is cap-
able of undertaking such a large
project and, hopefully, with suc-
cess.

Student Efforts
Called Gratilying
By State Director

The following is a letter written
by Claude Price, executive director
of the New York State Assomation
for Mental Health, Inc.

it is extremely gratifying to wit-
ness the growing concern of our
youth toward the social problems
facing today’s community. It ispar-
ticularly gratifying to see the unique
interest and understanding shown by
our students at the University to-
ward the needs aud problems facing
the mentally ill today.

With their upcoming Mental Health
Telethon, our students are demon-
strating to the community the value
of a highly creative and intelligent
youth program, which to my knowl-
edge, is the first student—faculty
mental health production ofthis kind
in the country.

Mental illness is the Nation's No.
1 health problem. Emotional and
intellectual stress is an ever-pre-
sent concern ln every locality, in
every community, and on every
college campus.

We therefore pledge, that the re-
sults of your efforts will be di-
rectly used for increasing the pro-
gram omphusis of fighting mental
illness on a community level, spe-
cifically in terms of research, pub-
lic education and information, with
a particular emphasis on the needs
of our youth on all levels.

a Telethon such as this. He felt
that the success of the Telethon
will depend primarily on the at-
tendance of students throughout the
22-hour period.

If the Telethbn proves to be h
success, Ed Krammer, director oi
publicity, felt that it could receive
recognition on the National \Vll‘t
Service and coverage by local tell“—
vision stations.

Closed Circuit Being Used

Television: units will be piano
throughout the Campus Center o
the lounges and in the cafeteria,
However, it will be a closed rir-
cuit unit. Co-c:hairmen Mishin
said outside television COVef'ilw-
“has been thoroughly explored” will-
the result that it would not be avail-
able this year. He felt that if this.
year's teiethon is a success the
hope of television coverage for next
year’s Telethon will improve tre-
mendously.

THE TELEVISION CREW has had to set

other rooms in the Campus Center.

Work Called Educational
As Students Learn Skills

The Telethon being presented to-
night has proven to be very educa-
tional to students in the fields of
communications, administra-
tive planning and various other skills
connected with the production of a
program such as the Telethon.

Jeff Mishkin and John Fotia, co-
chairmen of the Telethon, both ex-
pressed thai the whole experiment
was "Very educational.” They es-
pecially emphasized the benefits of
experience in research and serving
the community.

Television in lniancy

Mishkln felt that the use of tele-
vision on campus is still in its in-
fancy. But the presentation of this
Telethon has helped it to grow both
in improved methods of using it
and improved personnel in pre-
senting it. Through the combined
efforts of the engineers of WSUA
and interested students in the field
the growth of audio-video presenta-
tion to the University has been aided
by the Telethon.

Community Relations

Ed Krammer, director of pub-
licity, pointed out that the teiethon
has enablod students to work di-
rectly with the outside community
and to view the workings of the Uni-
versity administrative structure. He
felt “Just to get u teiethon set up
is a success."

Although most of the support has
come from students, a great deal
of the mechanical work,such as tags
for participants in the program and
the addressing of envelopes, has
been provided by the New York State
Mental Health Association.

"If the students get to see this
Telethon," according to Krammer,
“they will see the reward involved
and the good it has produced."

Cornin To Make
Guest ppearance

in addition to President Collins
who is opening the Mental Health
Telethon Friday evening, Mayor

desire to speak at the Telethon.

time the Mayor expressed his in-
terest in the project.
