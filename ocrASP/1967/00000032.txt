'Hiroshima Mon Amour’
Tonight’s Am. Film Feature

“Hiroshima, Mon Amour,” a
prize-winning French film, will be
presented at 7:30 p.m. tonight in
Draper 349. -

“Hiroshima, Mon Amour"is gen-
erally credited with opening up the
American film market to foreign
cinema in the late 1950’s. The pic-
ture won the international Critics'
Prize and the Belgian Critics’ Prize.

The film will be shown with Eng-
llsh subtitles and prplaced with a
short subject. Admission will be 750.

“Hiroshima, Mon Amour” tells
of the chance meeting between a
French actress and a Japanese ar-
chitect. Their love affair takes place
in post-war Hiroshima and director
Alain Resnais contrasts the enor-
mous, fantastic side of Hiroshima
with the tiny story of the woman’s
past and present loves.

The filln was first shown iIi 1058
to a private audience in Paris. The
shock of “Hiroshima, Mon Amour”
was intense; no one was able to

summarize its colltent in a few
ideas.
The film mixes individual and

collective themes in u space-tune
where past, present, iuturu, real-
ities, symbols, and contradictions
come together and produce coils—
ciuusness.

The role of memory dominates

William Butler Yeats’son spoke
Wednesday evening in the Colonial
Quad dining room on “Music and
Poetry; the works of William But-
ler Yeats."

Michael B. Yeats, a graduate of
Dublin, is a
member of the Irish Senate. “is
Speech covered his father’s views
on the relationship between/music
and poetry and his views on Irish
folk songs.

The inﬂuence of irish folk lore on
Yeats may be shown by hislnc'lusion
of folk songs in his early plays. He
was also influenced by the Gallic
culture and language. Later in life,
Yeats wrote ballads.

Yeats was preoccupied with writ-
ing popular poetry. He wanted his
poetry to appeal to and interest the
common people, "not only the edu-
cated few.” He said that, “Moore
was never a poet of the people. He
lived in his drawing room.” When
he began to write poems in ballad
form he did so hoping they might
spread among the people.

After meeting Lady Gregory,
Yeats became steeped in country
ballads. She took him from cottage
to cottage collecting folk songs from
peasants, some of whom had trans-
lated the songs themselves.

"Yeats’ sources were many and
various."

"He rarely gave information as
to where lie got his material, and
when he did it was usually “mis-
leading.”

"The spoken word,“ Yeats be-
lieved, "should always be para-
mount, for there is no word so great
that cannot be made greater,” by
being spoken. As part,of the young
lreland society, had a great desire
to be understood. He wrote "poems
and ballads of Young lreland," how-
ever, “his early ballads were not
intended to be sung.”

Yeats began looking a folk songs
in a different way as a means of
solving the problem of the relation-
ship between'words aiid music. He
had a great fear that the meaning
of words would be lost when set to
music.

If a song is brought into a play it
duos not matter from what school

are articulate. Words cannot, Yeats
believed, he subordinated to music.
“What would the word love be with
four beats in the middle?"

"Music is the most impersonator

all things and words the most pain.

sonal.” Singers cloud words. "Sing-
ers cannot sing poetry.”

Yeats carried his quest tor a
working relationship between Words
and music throughout his life. lie
was anxious to' unite the two but
never with words taking a subordi-
nate position to music. “Muslcmusi
take dictation from words.” ’l‘lw
Gallic singers delight in words.

Senator Yeats stated that it was
only with the spread of the English
language that ballads came iniopop-
ular use in lreland.

Yeats claimed that he remem-
bered only three lilies of a poem he

had heard sung by an old woman in.

Ballisodore. Yet there are many and
varied versions such as the one sung
by Miss O’Hagerty on the tape that
Senator Yeats played. This record-
ing had even more material in than
Yeats used.

Some of Yeats’ poems, Said his
son, are difficult and obscure com-
pared with folk ballads. This is
an illustration of a “complex mun
striving toward simplicity.”

DIPPIKILL PROPERTY has at

     

  

torcled relaxing facilities for o

few members of the University community. Comp Board is pre-
sently considering in what ways, and in what manner, they can
increase its facilities so that more students will he benefitted.

CampBoard HopesTo Enlarge
Use Of Dippikill Facilities

Since the University acquired
Camp Dippikill in 1958, it has been
used sparingly. This is primarily
because the facilities areinadequate
for large groups.

The goal of Camp Board is to de-
velop Camp Dippikiil’s potential so
the majority of the students may
use it for their benefit.

Richard Jankowski, Chairman of
Camp Board, would like to know
what activities the students would
prefer. He believes Dippikill can
provide any type of facility from
skiing to sailboating.

However, action cannot be taken
until student opinion is voiced. This
survey will help determine Dippi-
kill’s future.

Camp Board is proposing awide
range of activities for Dippikill.
They would like to have a modern
lodge built for student use.

They also would like to provide
swimming and fishing at the lake.
Hoped for in the future is a ski-
siope and lift.

Camp Board estimates its need
at $60,000 to $100,000. These funds
would be provided by The Faculty
Student Association.

Eventually, Camp Board would
like to see Dippikill used every
weekend for a variety of recrea-
tional and cultural purposes.

if the money is granted in the
near future, building can begin this
summer. in that case, the project
will be ready for next fall. Free
bus service will also be included.

The members of Camp Board
want to see Dippikill’s potential
used to the fullest. They want the
student body to be aware of the pos-
sibilities for enjoying the beautiful
country at Dippikill.
