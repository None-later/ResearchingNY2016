Many realistic settings are used
and the action must shift from scene
to scene almost as quickly as a
"dissolve on" the “silver screen."

Staging Problem
This represents quite a problem

between the scenes.

Contract Pointed Out
The weather-worn, rustic, gin-
gerbread-ornamented beams of
Gashwiier’s General Store in Sims-
bury are a world apart from the

1920 modern, chrome-plated gla- -

mour of the Hollywood Holden Pic-
ture Lot. These contrasts have been
painstakingly pointed out in design,
color and texture of materials.

Many, many long hard hours of.
careful work have gone into changing
canvas, plywood, pine and paint

mixed with imagination into Holly-I

wood and Simsbury.

Fun and Frolic
The play is set in the 19z0's, so
all of the fun and frolic of this flap-

. ping era can be expected in some

Leonard sees “Merton” as a satire on an idealism
which pursues “flimsy, hollow goals.” We see the
title character in a kind of love-affair with illusion,
and no amount of disillusionment turns Merton from
the path to his goals.

The renewed national interest in the “Twenties”
also helps to keep “Merton” from being a dated play.
It has a- real theatrical life ofits own, and our remote-
ness from the time of the play seems only to add
to the humor of it.

We laugh and enjoy the ingenuousness of that day,
yet our very interest in the time indicates we are
excited about the innocence expressed by the pat
solutions and happy endings of that age.

The chaos of our times has fostered a longing for
innocence which is demonstrated in part by our in-
terest in old advertisements, the flamboyant clothing
our day which is reminiscent of the clothes of the
“Twenties,” and even by the Pop Art movement
which recalls the innocence of the comic strips.

Cast in Rehearsal

With the cast in rehearsal for next week’s opening,
the director is seeking to develop characters who
will possess a quality of stereotype. Through gesture
and tone he intends to achieve characterization that
illustrates a social, rather than a psychological.
view of. a particular type.

For example, Sigmund Rosenblatt, a silent movie
director in the play. will demonstrate the “worst
excesses of Hollywood phoniness." The familiar
megaphone and leather puttees may well be among
his trappings. The rest of the large cast (twenty-
three, plus a comic violinist for mood music) is
similarly developing touches that will recall the si-
lent movie age and retain the pungenoy and humor
of the original "Merton."

‘Me mm’ Plot
In Real-Life

involvement in the “Merton” plot
is getting to be quite ahabit for Rob-
eri Clayton who plays the general
Storekeeper, Amos Gashwiler in the
University Theatre’s revival of the
play.

Role in "The Graduate"
Recently, he saw an article in the
"New York Times,” which men-

find someone to play the lead role
of a twenty—two year old male in his
new movie, “The Graduate."

Here the parallel begins. Just as
Merton Gill leaves Simsbury, ill. to
seek his fortune in Hollywood, so
Bob too decided to seek the lead
role in the new film. Writing to
Nichols, he described himself, his
capabilities and asked for an inter-
view.

After mailing the letter, he forgot
about it to concentrate on his rolein
the University staging.

Small Town Boy

Like the Merton oi theplay,Clay-
ion is a small town boy. ills home
is in Waverly, New York and he one
to Albany in 1965. Bob says he first
became interested inthetheaire asa
child, and he has been active in high
school, service and community tilea-
ire.

Clayton was in rehearsal for his
role in "Marion" for only a short
time when a reply to his letter ur-
rived from the casting director for
the movie. Just as Merton takes his
portfolio of hometown stills to Holly-
wood for submission to directors,so
Bob was asked to submit photographs
if he wished to be considered fertile
part.

Photographs Tali-n

it took him awhile togetthephoto-
graphs taken in his home town, but
he finally managed. and sent them all
to Nichols. Little remains for the
parallel to be complete.
