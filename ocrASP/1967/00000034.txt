‘ Sunday evening Harrison Salis-

A - bur'y. gave his "ReportvFrom Han-
oi" to about 800 people, many of
~ whom were either listening only
to what they wanted to hear, or
wore half-asleep. .

Much to the dismay of quite a
'aw of those sitting around me, at
least, he rarely gotemotional,didn’t
call for the impeachment oi Earl
Warren even once, and didn’t even
~ » accuse Lyndon Johnson of plotting
’ the death of John F. Kennedy.

Fortunately for the image of the
University, most of these people

 

 

.were gray haired women who looked
as if they missed their white sneak-
ers. The more I see these poeple,
the more I can appreciate the ar-
guments of the opponents of women

true story of Ray McCloat, and his
moustachioed picture which appeared
at the top of his column, the “Bay View
of Sports,” for quite a few issues last
semester. Those who know Ray know he

has never sported a moustache in real

life. :

However, all of a sudden one Friday
Ray to his surprise was seen in the

upper lefthand corner of the

with a moustache. Ithappened one Thurs-
day morning, when, as usual,
for the Friday paper were spread out all
over the office. A student, the notorious
Klaus Schnitzer of Torch fame, walked in
with a picture for a Torch ad and, being
artistically inclined, drew a moustache

.on Ray’s picture.
We erased the moustache

picture to the printer. Little did we know
the erasure was ineffective, and that from
then on Ray would wear a moustachioed
grin at the top of his column.

In the following weeks we sent other
pictures of Ray to the printer. but evi—
dently he had taken a liking to Ray with
a moustache, for every week the mou-
stache appeared. However, Ray never
became angry. In fact, we seldom heard
Ray ever bcomes angry or annoyed at
all.- He handled his job as sports editor
of the ASP for four semesters, calmly
(which is most difficult at times), ade—
quately, and was always a pleasure to

have in the office.

. Telethon Congratulations

The spirit of both the crew and the
audience at the telethon was high through—
out the whole 22 heurs.
were up all night and even members of
the audience supported all the acts with
their clapping.

The time and energy which went into
this production is both amazing and ad—
mirable. Almost everyone put more into
their part in the telethon than had been
expected of them.

Often during the night a performer
could be seen catching a moment of
sleep curled up on a_couch in one of
the lounges or on the floor in the hall.

At the. end of the whole telethon at
5 p.m. Saturday people poured out of
the ballroom exclaiming, “Great” and
“impressive.’_’

telethon had succeeded as well as it did.
There had always been a few, however,
who knew it would succeed. It was there
hope that convinced others and made it
a success. Contributors, especially the
“little people,” and crew alike are to
be congratulated for their contributions
to a worthy cause.

It is becoming increasingly rare
that the rational opponents of pre-
sent U. 5. foreign policy areexposed
to the public eye.

This, of course, is unfair. There
are many students who realize that
there is more to this war than a
few bleeding children, or an oc-
casionally bombed hospital. Salis-
bury made this clear at the lecture
to anyone willing to listen.

Although their opinions are some-

 

what opposed to my own and those
of manyothers on this campus,
there is now, for the first time, a
group on this campus willing to put
intellectual commentary into the
ill ht.

spg‘heg Faculty-Student Committee
is sponsoring a series ofworkshops
centering on the Vietnam issue. At
these workshops, it is the object
to present a rational intellectual
discussion based upon"free discus-
sion which considers all points of
view.”

This may be the first time for
many of us to be exposed to the kind
of atmosphere which one would ex-
pect from a college community.Now
that we have proved, via the tele-
thon, that we are capable of spirit,
we finally have a chance to prove
that we are capable of intelligence.

These workshops not only are
open to people of all political per-
suasion, but, to my mind, depend
for their full success upon the active
attendance of all of these people.
The only thing that I hope for is that
these activities continue on the high
level that they promise. We allhave
enough access to all of the moronic
gutteral on the war that any logical
person can stand.

 

 

Expensive Kiss

To the Editor:

To the residents of Colonial Quad-
rangle

As many of you already know, our
quadrangle made a resounding suc-
cess of its post-deadline telethon
finale. For those of you who haven’t
heard, and those of you who don’t
live on Colonial Quad, here is what
happened:

The telethon was drawing to a
close, when Joe Zanca (auctioneer
of Chinese Auction fame) and I
made arrangements to take Tele-
thon collections during the dinner
hour at both of the new quads. Joe’s
idea of auctioning kisses, provided
by volunteers from the audience
here on the Colonial Quad, proved
to be a great money-maker. At the
completion of this event, notaspeck
of doubt can remain abouiour school
spirit.

The total take from kiss sales
was approximately $160.00, $150.00
of the total coming from the sale of
two kisses. Who is the lovely lady
whose favors brought such returns?
Miss Mady Land a Beta Zetapledge.

Thanks to the spirited bidding by
the members of Potter Club, the
members of IFO (from Johnson
Hall), and associated independents,
Joe was able to get $75.00 for each
of Mady’s two kisses.

All that i can say is many thanks

indicates that certain students who
suppOrt the U. S. Government policy
in Vietnam “cannot bother to waste
the time to refute the senseless ar-
guments of those who support the

In this context, it is gratifying to
learn that Mr. Devoretz and pos-
sibly others are now willing to give
of their precious time in order to
refute our position. The death and
destruction of war is noiusignificant

We of the Committee certainly do
not believe that our arguments are
“senseless” and stand willing and
prepared to present them and the
evidence upon which they are
founded. ‘

The Student-Faculty to End the
War in Vietnam hereby challenges
Mr. Devorsets, and all other stu-
dents and faculty members of sim-
ilar inclination, to an opendebate on
the issue of the War in Vietnam.
Such a debate might prove to be
enlightening to them or us, or both,
and also to the entire student and
faculty body of this University.

Mr. Fractenberg, director of the
University's debate program and
member of the Speech Department,
has offered to arrange an Oxford
style debate for us in the Campus
Center Ballroom.

Anyone wishingto debate us should
contact llaroid Lynne or myself. We
look forward to a speedy acceptance
of our challenge.

To Choose Bests '
From Broadway Hits

by Robert B. Cutty

'Thls year’s Tony Awards pre-
sentation will surely be one of the
most exciting awards programs in
years. Tile hour-long show to be
televised by ABC at 0:30 p.m.
March 26, is the annual highlight of
therbroadway season.

Broadway’s version of Holly-
wood’s Oscars and TV’s Emmys is
sponsored by the American Theatre
\Ving’s 500 members.

The program this year is being
produced by Broadway’s major non-
musical enierpreneur Alexander H.
Cohen, the Harold Prince of drama.
Helping to feed suspense into the
show is the quality of the nomina-

, tions in all- categories.

Vying for Best Play

Edward Albee's controversial “A
Delicate Balance," Peter Shaffer’s
slapstick “Black Comedy,” Harold
Pinter’s much-discussed “The
Homecoming" and Frank Marcus’s
"The Killing of Sister George” are
vying for best play.

Nominated for Best Dramatic Star
are actors Hume Cronyn for “Dell-
cate Balance,” Donald Madden for
"Black Comedy," Donald Moffat of
APA Repertory Company and Paul
R oge r ’ s for “Homecoming”
matched with acresses Eileen Mer-
chant arid Beryl Reid for "Killing
of Sister George,” Vivien Merchant
in “Homecoming” and Rosemary
Murphy in “Delicate Balance.“

Best Actor and Actress

This columnist suspects Pinter
will take the Best Play, though pro-
ducer Cohen could also win for Shu-
fer’s serio-comedy. The Best Dra-
matic Actor Award should go to
Cronyn through “iiiuck (.‘omcdy"
could bring Madden tho ll\\ill'd.

Probably no one familiar with the abilities of those
in charge were ever in doubt as to the success of the
enterprise as a whole; but even so. the degree of
response made to the weekend’s mental health tele—
thon is both astonishing and gratifying.

Anyone who put. in even a few minutes at the ball-
room Friday or Saturday couldn’t miss seeing the
faces of the two chairmen of the telethon, John Fotia
and Jeffrey Mishkin. and couldn’t miss either seeing
the amount of devotion each displayed for his job.
Fotia, especially. was a constant bundle of ncrvous(?)
energy, on stage the major part of the time and gen-
orally never standing still.

Then, of course, there were the otheremcces. Per-
haps it were better not to mention Sorrel! Chesin
and his incessant clowning, but it’s undeniable that
he and his nephew provided some of the more comic
moments of the twenty-two hour period.

As for Marty Mann. his big moment came with
his belly dance, which, incidentally, drew more con—
tributions than any other act. High points of the indi4
vidual acts had to be Gary Aldrich, Dennis Buck, the
hour—long Broadway medley performed by Kaufman.
Fotia, Pineili and Untraoht.

But if a star were to be named, it would have to be
the student body itself. who. despite the legendary
poverty 'of collegians, contributed over $5400 to sup—
rt mental health.
