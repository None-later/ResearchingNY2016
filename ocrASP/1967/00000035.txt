aionchamplonship Saturday as he scored a close 7—6 decision over Glen Younger
of v Western State, in the final ‘round .of the 123 pound division. The match was
probably Warren’s toughest this year, as the outcome was in doubt right to the

f end. The win upped Warren’s record to an. amazing 17-0.

In his first matchCrow
gained a 6-3 decision over
Melvin Smith of Fort
Lewis, Colorado, who had
a 9-2 overall record going
' into the match.

This win moved Warren into the
quarter-finals where he registered
an impressive 7-0 shutout over

James Burch of Ashland College
(Ohio). Burch had amassed a 10-2-2
during the season.

Another Shutout for Crow

in the semi-finals, Crow scored
 a second shutout as he decisioned
‘ ' . Mike Howe of Mankato State (Minn.),
an excellent wrestler with an ll-l
record, by a 6-0 count. Thus the
stage was set for his dual with
Younger who had accumulated 15
wins against 2 losses.

WARREN CROW, 123 pound wrestling champion, defended his

crown successfully to retain his NCAA title. Warren's next goal
is the University division crown.

The AMIA League I bowling lead became a shared
commodity Saturday, when previous leader Potter
Club lost five of a possible seven points to the Chop-
pers. The Justice League grabbed part of the lead as
it took five points in its match with third place Bad
News Five. Potter and Justice League both sport
identical 26-9 records. ms, while Don McManus led the

Springer, Palmer Have It Rough

Besides Crow’s fine performance
Coach Garcia also had praise for
Craig Springer mleandy Palmer
who wrestled well against very tough

competition. Palmer lost his first
match to Jerry Bond of State Col-
lege of laws who was 15-3-1 on the
season. Springer was decisioned
7-3 by Jim Knutso (10-3) of Augus-
tana College. Palmer got to wrestle

again when Bond got into the finals,
and this time he lost a very close
match to Paul Stehman of Northwest
Missouri State.

in a very respectable 14th place
with a total of 70 schools competing.

Crow Goes to University Dlvlalon

Crow, whose victory made him one
of two repeating champsions, will
now begin preparation from
N.C.A.A. University division cham-
pionships to be held March 23-25
at Kent state University -(Ohlo).

Last year, wrestling at 123 War-
ren placed fourth in spite of the ef-
fects of a heavy cold and a painful
knee injury. Thisyear Warren hopes
to compete at 115, where he would

V be likely to meet Portland State's

Rick Sanders. Sanders won the col-
lege championship at 115 and is the

sity division, but Crow beat hlmlast

LALBANY, NEW YORK
Evans Presents
Petition To Barr,
Ilraos Jory Action

A petition signed by over 2000

'1 Albanians and University students

was almost presented to Governor

Nelson Rockefeller Wednesday af- '

ternoon by representatives of seven
local organizations.

The petition called for the Gov-
ernor to intervene in the present
Grand Jury investigation of voting
irregularities in Albany County.
Specifically the inviestigatlon cen-
ters on the alleged $5 vote in Al-
bony.

The petition was prepared and
presented by The Albany County
Committee to investigate Votingand
Elections, which includes Richard
Evans, an Albany State student who
is chairman of the Tri-Cities Stu-
dent Alliance.

The group was unable to meet
with Rockefeller because ofasched-
uie mixup, but did present the peti-
tion to Daniel Barr, the Governor’s
assistant Press Secretary, who
promised to present the petition to
the Governor.

Evans said "1 recommend student
interest in this affair. If you want
to have influence into what goes on
write or phone your assemblyman
or senator to express your opinion
to them and to urge them to ask
the governor to take action."

a? “Further,” Evans stated, "All

people in the state should take an
interest in seeing the state's laws
upheld. Students could write home
to have friends and relatives con-
tact their representatives also.”

This action would not be without
precedent. As early as 1938 Gover-
nor Herbert Lehman found cases
of “vote fraud" in Albany and ob-
tained 174 convictions.

Governor Thomas E. Dewey’sad-
ministration saw another investiga-
tion into Albany politics and found
evidence of voting irregularities,
but the Grand Jury refused to in-
dict anyone.

Currently, the Grand Jury now
meeting for several hours every
other week has drawn heavy cri-
ticism for its lack of progress.
Another grounds for criticism is
that the current Grand Jury re-
quires witnesses to waive immun-
ity from future prosecution in the
face of District Attorney John T.
Garry’s public declaration that he
will prosecute both the giver and
taker in a vote buying situation.

The Albany independent Move-
ment (AIM) has charged that of the

‘ 22 Jurors on the Grand Jury, 19 are

'registered Democrats, while none
of the others are Republicans. in
addition, 20 of them are serving for
the second time in two yeas on a
jury that State law requires be se-
lected randomly from throughout
the county.

Wednesday's petition stems from
a letter to the Governor on February
8, 1907, which urged the Governor
to intervene in the investigation.
The letter was signed by 14 area
ministers, including Frank Snow,
Albany State Campus Minister.

‘ Schedule Conﬂict

HaltsKennedy Visit

Senator Robert F. Kennedy's visit
scheduled for tomorrow, has been
cancelled. According to Aileen
Schlef, a Kennedy aide called to
report a conflict in the Senator's
schedule.

The plans had included a ques-

. tion and answer period in the ball—

room of the Campus Center Bulld-
ing. Miss Schlef is confident that
the Senator will visit the campus

sometime later in tho semester.

War- Workshops This Weekend
Designed To Inform Students

Throughout this week theStudent-
Faculty Committee to end the War
in Vietnam is conducting six intro-
ductory workshops on the war. The
two remaining discussions will be
at 3:45 tomorrow in Humanities 129
and at 7:00 Sunday in Humanities
123. The purpose of these informal
discussions according to Douglas
Auster, one of the group leaders,
is to inform the students of the
different aspects of the war in
Vietnam and to bring the students
out of their niche of apathy.

Two topics mentioned during most
of the workshops this week were
concerned with the reasons why the
United States is in Vietnam and why
the American people 'fear com-
munism as much as they do. Luring
the Tuesday meeting the theory was

Neorealistic Film
'ihe_ Bicycle lhiei’
laugh it liii

The most highly acclaimed of
italian neoreallstlc films, “The Bi-
cycle Thlef," is this week's pre-
sentation of the international Film
Group.

Shot entirely with a cast of non-
professlonals, the film's story is
that of a man and his son search-
ing through the streets of Rome
for the stolen bicycle needed for a
long-sought Job. The director, Vit-
torio Do Slca, won worldwide hon-
ors for this picture--followed by
later triumphs such as "Umberto
D," l‘Two Wooten,” “Yesterday,
Today, and Tomorrow," and "Mar-
riage ltalian Style."

in a brief article it is impossible
to summarize the impact this simple
and incredibly moving film had on
the cinema world. Many critics
called it the best film since the
coming of sound, and it appears
consistently on critics’ list of the
"Ten Best Films Ever Made." it
won numerous prizes at every ma-
ior film' festival and an Academy
Award for the “best foreign film
of the year."

Contrary to the WC schedule,
“The Bicycle Thief" will be shown
Friday,.NOT Saturday. in Draper
349, at 7:00 and Bali. Admission is
50¢ with student tax, 75¢ without.

vantage of this fear when they asked
for our aid in Vietnam in 1950.

Differentiation of Communism

At the Monday group discussion
it was pointed out that the fear the
United States had against commun-
ism was against all forms of com-
munism. Now, however, according
to the theories, our government is
learning to differentiate among the
various types of communism and
fears some forms less than others.
Since each group has a different
discussion leader and different
people participating, the topics at
each meeting are not limited to some
certain questions, but to anything
the group wishes to speak about.

The Monday discussion group
talked to some length on the eco-
nomic aspects of the war. The
economic reasons discussed were
mainly based on the advantages of
the war to American business,

Dr. Wilfred imrich, who attended
Monday explained how an American
business was able to invest in his
native Austria after the war and
squeeze out any possible competi-
tion. imrich the surmised that
American busin as may be doing
the same thing in South Vietnam.

plus for the war and others felt

it a reason why the war was evil.
Small Audience

Since there has been an audience
of no more titan fifteen people at
these meetings, the informality of
the discussions is assured. The
participants at these meetings were
asked, though, to keep the discus-
sion at an acceptable scholarly level.
This level was maintained by all
those who took part. The discussion
leaders attempted to play down the
emotional aspects of the war and
emphaslzed the objective issues
concerned with Vietnam.

There was a decided difference
between the members of the anti-
war committee and the members of
the rest of the University commun-
ity who attended these group dis-
cussions. The members of the anti-
war committee were well-versed in
the war and the many factors re-
lating to it while the students, for
the most part, were not.

Collins initiates
Final Acceptance
iii llcoltl‘ Polity

President Collins an-
nounced his final signature
of the alcohol policy‘at the
P re side n t’s Conference
Monday. This means the
policy can go into effect as
soon as “details of opera-
tion” have been workedout.

"Details of operation" refer
mainly to obtaining a New York
State Liquor License. At present
no definite time has been set for
the amount of time it will take to
obtain the license. However, the
President will be meetingwithliquor
authorities this week to try and
determine the time it will take to
obtain a license. -

The policy is the same as the one
handed down by the Committee to
Draft the University Alcohol Policy,
except it clarifies the two areas
which were not covered specifically
in the policy.

The clarifications deal with the
legality of liquor in the residence
halls And residence courtyards, and
prohibit liquor in both of these
areas.

Collins also noted that the pre-
sent Committee on Alcohol Policy
will be maintained to help put the
policy into effect; however, new
members may be added to theCom-
mittee from the Community Pro-
gramming Committee and LAAC.

He also announced the appoint-
ment ofa new President's committee
to discuss all the aspects of inter-
collegiate athletic policy.

The committee, which will be
composed of five faculty, two stu-
dents, one member of AlumniAsso-
elation, one member of the Univer-
sity Council, will be headed by
Dr. Clifton Thorne, vice president
for student affairs.

Collins explained that the selec-
tion of this committee is designed
to create as wide a range of people
as possible, especially those who
will represent groups vital to the
adoption of any athletic policies.

it is designed to be an all Uni-
versity to coordinate University pol-
icy on intercollegiate athletics, to
develop a rationale for inter-col-
legiate athletics, and finally to rec-
ommend a broad athletic policy to
the University Council.
