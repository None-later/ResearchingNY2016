Tuesday night at 7:30 p.m. in Draper

Banned in its native land, "Viri-
dlana" relates the story of a young
novltiate’s awakening to the world.
Her attempts to practice the charity
of her faith lead to disaster.

The film was produced in Spain
in 1960 by Luis Bunuel. Described
by one critic as "madly blasphe-
mous," the pictures anti-religious
stance lead the Spanish government
to attempt its suppression. Bunuel
left the country with the film before
it could be destroyed.

Upon release, the picture met
with critical acclaim everywhere
but the country of its origin, where
today it still cannot be shown. The

“Saturday Review" commented that
