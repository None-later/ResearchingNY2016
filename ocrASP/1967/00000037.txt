Attack = Panels 'Stuil'yin‘gr [trait

Washington, o.c., March 6 (ops),
Proponents of voluntary; national,

service have attacked the reports
of two government panels studying
tile draft for their failure to con-
sider voluntary work as an alter-
nate to conscription. -, '

Eighteen leaders. of student or-
ganizations have informed the Pres-
ident by telegram that they are
“appalled that the two advisory
groups make no provision in their
recommendations fora move toward
voluntary national service."

;The youth group leaders, repre-
senting political andreligious or-
ganizations, had called for abolition
of the draft at a February meeting
sponsored by MODERATOR Maga-
zine.

Students Comment

In their statement to the Presi-
dent, the students commented, “It
seems incredible to us that (the
two investigating bodies) fail to
propose any realistic programs for
significantly extending voluntary
service in either the armed forces
or in non-military, humanitarian
programs."

Heavy criticism was directed at
the report of the President’s Na-
tional Advisory Commission on Se-
lective Service, headed by former
Assistant Attorney General Burke
Marshall. The students charged that
the Marshall Commission's recom-
mendations “are agrab-bag ofstop-
gap measures designed to alleviate
certain inequities at the cost oi fur-
ther entrenching and exacerbating
the impact oi conscription."

Stated the student leaders, "The
Commission recommendations, if
implemented, mean the perpetuation
of a system which debases human
dignity and deprives young Amer-
icans of their freedom."

Signers
Signers of the statement included
officers of the College Young Dem-
ocrats, the Young Republican Na-
tional Federation, the Y.M.C.A. Stu-
dent Council, nnd the University
Christian Movement.

One of the recommendations of
the Marshall Commission was the
abolition of student deferments. in
a statement to Congress released
today, the President announced that
he was partially implementing that
suggestion.

An executive order to be issued
in the near future will abolish ile-
fermenis for graduate students, un-
less those students are attending
medical or dental school. The Pros-
ident stated that “student defer-
ments have resulted in inequities
because many of those deferments
have pyramlded into exemptions
from military service."

Motor Points
Other major points in the Pros.-

ldent's message include the induc-
tion of men beginning at age 19,
“reversing . the, present order of
calling the oldest first, so that un-
certainties now. generated in the
lives of yoiuig, men will be reduced;"
uniform rules for determining non-
student .deferments; and the estab-
lishment of a lottery system of
“fair and impartial random" (FAIR)
to determine the order'of call for
eligible men.

Additionally, the President called
for immediate improvement of the
Selective-Service System "to as-
sure better service to the registrant
both in counseling and appeals, bet-
ter information to the public regard-
ing the System’s operation and
broader representation ‘on local
boards of the communities they
serve.”

Johnson's recommendations also
include the continuation of the Mar-
shall Commission for another year,
"to provide a continuing review of
the system that touches the lives of
so many young Americans and their
families."

Message on Draft

In his message on the draft, the
President also suggested that “en-
listment procedures for our Na-
tional Guard and Reserve units be
strengthened to remove inequities
and to ensure a high state of readi-
ness for those units."

The President praised the work
of young Americans, who, through
service in such programs as VISTA
and the Peace Corps, “have touched,
and perhaps even changed, the life
of our country and our world.”

But he said that both the Mar-
shall Commission report and the
statement of a special panel re-
porting to the House Armed Serv-
ices Committee found that the Uni-
ted States cannot “establish, through
these programs and others like
them, a practical system of non-
military alternatives to the draft
without harming our national so-
curity."

Johnson Hopes

Johnson said, however, that he
hopes “the spirit oi voluntary serv-
ice in socially useful enterprises
will .., continue to grow until that
good day when all service will be
Voluntary, when all young people
can and will choose the kind of
service best fitted to their own
needs and their nation's."

The President stated that “be-
cause of the conditions of the world
we live in now, we ust continue to
ask one form of service our military
duty -- of our young men. We would
be an irresponsible nation it we did
not -- and perhaps even an extinct
one."

He said he believes the proposals
he has sent to Congress will ‘lelp
create the fairest system that can
be devised for choosing who shall
serve in the military.

Last year i began writing a jazz
column for the illustrious ASP and
had to give”it up'because of com-
mitments to our other fantastic
communications media on the cam-

‘ pus. Now that l have seenflt to ter-

mins’te my association with them,
[can return to my one true love,
the prihted word (wha7). r -

There are going to be many things
happening in the Jazz Scene in and
around Albany during the next few
months. This column will be used
to make you aware of what’s really
happening and to urge you to go
see it. '

I will also be telling you about
various jazz recordings and artists.
But there will be ‘a difference in
my “reporting.” 1 don't intend to
spend much' time covering well-

' known artists because they have had

more than their shar'e of jiizzglory
and really don't need any more.
So, I'll be'spending' my time'vnth
such people asJeremy Steig, the

Thad Jones Band, Kenny Harrell,
and many other lessor known jazz
artists. For these are the men who

are pushing jazz and struggling to.

make a‘ living at it. '

Let's start out this issue with
one of my favorite sounds in the
realm ,of jazz: Jeremy Staig. With-
out a doubt, Jeremy'is the perfect
example of the unknown jazz ar-
tist: out of work, underrated, and
very good. Tovdate, i have heard
Jeremy on only two albums. The
best is the album he has put out
on the Columbia label- called "Flute
Fever" (CL 2136). WithDenny Zeit-,
lin, Ben Tucher, and Ben Reilly,
Jeremy has hit on a combination of
musicians that added more than their

t.   

own share to the excitement that is
his album. I

Jeremy has a rather interesting
background. He. has been playing
flute since he was eight years old
and 'has been playing jazz since he
was fifteen. The typical thing for a
budding jazz musician is the one-
night stand. Jeremy has and is still

' doing more thanhie share of them.

Approximately five years ago,
Jeremy had a motorcycle accident
and paralyzed his face. Since he
couldn't play, he started working in
the vein that his entire family has
fingers in: painting. Despite the fact
that he is rather good at this, he
still wasn't satisfied.’Another oper-
ation left his face partially paralyzed
and Jeremy decided to' play again.
Fashioning a special mouthpiece,
he started back and has made more

 

' Marsh 17, 1967

 

than an impression on the jazz aud-
iences that have heard him.

Now, I realize that the first com.
ment is that there are at least two
other fine flutists in the business
that have made it. This is all true
and I wish them well. The thing is
that Jeremy Steig has more on the

ball than the better-known of the
two and could actually play rings
around him. His sound is exciting,
agitating, and many other adjectives
that i don't have the room to print.
So, in a word, let's just say that
Jeremy Steig is great.

Next week, I'll be telling you a
little bit more about the realm of
jazz. in ever get one of my albums
back from one certain jazz an-
nouncer i know, I will talk about
Lee Morgan.

Student Volunteers
To Tutor Children
Requested'liy Trinity

. The following was not written by

a little girl from the Albany slums,
but its author believes it could have
been. Many students from elemen-
tary through high school need tu-
tors in almost any subject. Anyone
wishing to tutor at Clinton Square
Neighborhood House or at Trinity
Institute, please call Melanie Long
at 489-6647 (please call before
10:30). Tutoring is for one hour a
week, with a few extra activities
if desired. Transportation or not
knowing the material well enough
don't present problems.

“I am a girl in grade 5 and I
ain’t so good in school. My step-

.Inother works all day so she don't

find much time to help us kids with
our homework. I don't know where
my father is. My two big brothers
and two big sisters ain't much good
to help either. One brother don‘t go
to school no more.

I think he was in grade 10 when
he quit. My teacher nln't too bad
but there is lots of bad boys in my
class so she never can help me.’
All us kids do our work In the
kitchen. But Its nwiul noisy.

My mother is so tired when she
comes home from work we have to
get Slipper and watch the babies.
i don’t hate school but my big
brothers hate it. I think i will hate
it when I get older because my
work is awful bard. Sometime I
don't think nobody cares if I do
good in school. But my friend told
me about this person who is her
tutor. lier tutor helps her with her
homework and says she wants her
to do good. I wish I had a tutor. if
my big brother had a tutor maybe
he stays in school and not quit like
the other one. Like he says he’s
gonna. if i had a tutor i could help
my sister with her work too. Won’t
you be my tutor."

'During World War II, Babbitt’s
work was mainly in mathematics,
in Washington and at Princeton.
Immediately after the war, how-,

system, published an analytical
study of the Bartok quartets, and
composed his first works to employ
methods that later became knownas
