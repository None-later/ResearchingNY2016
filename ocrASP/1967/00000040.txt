from the supplementary

sently being requested by Governor
Rockefeller outward, but it seems to us
that in some cases this is done at undue
expense to the student welfare.

The most blatant example of this is
presently staring into the faces of those
students who are filling out their hous-
ing packets, knowing that all doubles
will be tripled, all quadruples will be
quintupled. ad infinitum. The rule ap-
pears to be: take the number of people
planned for the accommodation and add

one .

In all seriousness, however. we recog-
nize the motivating philosophy behind
the growth which causes this overcrowd-

ing. It has become one

‘ motivating philosophies of the State Uni-
versity System in its recent growth:
that the State University System should
endeavor to provide the best education
for as many students as possible.

But we, as students being tripled, do
not think the question is all that moral
or all that fair. Theoretically you are
jeopardizing four students living in a
four-man suite when you add a fifth per—

son. True, those sharing

rooms do receive a lower housing bill,
but I doubt if anyone of them think it
was worth their peace of mind.

it seems to us the opinions of the
students might be valuable here; per-

COMM UNI CA TIONS

Defends Faculty

To the Editors:

in letters printed in the March
17th issue of the ASP, Lauren Kurz
and Dottie Mancusi found it difficult
to “understand the absence of sup-
port by most of the university fac-
ulty" for the Mental Health Tele-
thon. While i can speak only for
myself, i think that some of my
views are shared by my colleagues,
and perhaps they will cast some
light on reasons for this lack of
support.

First, if we assume that theprin-
cipal purpose of the Telethon was
to raise money for mental health,
then it should be pointed out that
faculty members participate as a
group in only one annual fund-
raising activity. the local Com-
munity Chest-Red Cross solicita-
tion.

Nonetheless, many of us are,
through local community ties, in-
volved in the apparently endless
solicitations for the various health
funds. Given these numerous an-
nual pressures, it is difficult to get
a majority of the faculty very en-
thusiastic about any particular
health fund.

Second, if, as Miss Kurz sup.
gelled, the purpose of the Telethon
was to "increase dialogue and com-
munication between students and

faculty," faculty members like my-
self would say that this is a poor
way to do it.

i'm afraid that in my estima-
tion Mental Health Telethous rank
with intercollegiate football and
class or dormitory ions as methods
of improving faculty-student com-
munication and ofdevelopingascnse
of a University community.

Many of us feel sadly harassed
in a University riding, like Stephen
Leacock's heroine, of! in all direc-
tions at once. it is no denigration
of the motives or efforts of the
sponsors of the Telethon to say
that many faculty members felt
they could use their time more
profitably than by participating in
the Mental Health Telethon.

No Telegrams

To the Editorl

in reference to an article in the
paper a few weeks ago concerning
students who do not pay their med-
ical bills to Albany oreaphynicians,
i should like to relay the following
information which is pertinent to
this situation.

Today i tried to send a telegram
from my suite phone. When i was
asked for my address, 1 was told
that since i was calling from a

University phone that l was not
allowed to put telegram charges on
that phone.

1 spoke to the manager of the
telegram office who told me that
there have been so many unpaid
bills in the past that there were to
be no more charges to University
students’ phones. He added that he
did not know when this measure
would be rescinded.

From what i understand, the Uni-
versity pays all phone bills after
the students bring or send payment
to the business office. if the busi-
ness office is not paying the tele-
gram company on time, why should
the students have to put up with
this nonsense? -

Another problem which i am sure
exists is that students are not pay-
ing their phone bills on time, thus
delaying the University payments.

if students continue to be bad
credit risks. it will be very hard
in the future to purchase anything
on credit in the area. There are
some stores that will not issue
credit to University students under
any conditions. This situation must
be alleviated.

if this situation continues, it is
almost inevitable that 467 and 473
will be only inter-university num-
bers and will not be for outside use.

A HANDICAP TO D.A.'S?.

Too much attention has been paid
'ln recent“ months to the fun and
games antics of John T. Garry ll,
Albany District Attorney, to the
total exclusion of M.Andrew Dwyer,
Rensseiaer's comedian.

Despite his recent setback in his
continuing attempt to deny the exist-
ence of the United-States Constitu-
tion and the free speech provisions
Dwyer has not given up.

His last defeat came when he
tried to bring charges against Peter
Jennings, ABC, and Channel 13 in
Albany for producing and showing
the documentary on today's chang-
ing mores (norms).

Now the charging white warrior
and protector of America's morals
has once again tried to ignore the
right of freedom of speech. The
object this time is Dr. Timothy
Leary, self-styled leader of the
tune-in, turp-on movement.

Leary is scheduled to speak on
the R.P.I. campus on April 8th in
a debate on LSD with a recognized
New York State Narcotics expert.
The world must be kept safe, ac-
cording to Dwyer, from being ex-
posed to such a “wild-eyed fanatic.’ ’

He implied that the public at
large who elected him to his office
was not smart enough to listen to
both sides of an argument, as would
be the case in this debate. Facts
are not important to this District

Attorney, such as the one that this
debate has been repeated on several

other campuses with no resultant
trouble.

Another problem with Dwyer's
lack of‘faith with the public is that
the some public who cannot listen
to both sides of an argument and
intelligently make up their minds

is the same public who elected .

Dwyer to office as the result of a
political campaign. "

The worst part of this contro-
versy is that this erstwhile public
servant had enough success to limit
the program to R.P.I. students only.

It would not be so bad if this
man was another clown like Jim
Garrison, but Dwyer is dead serious.
it is enough to scare a person.

it is amazing how much childish-
ness is being demonstrated by
Greeks and would-be Greeks onthis
campus. inter-Fraternity Council
denied full status to any of the
colonies for the wildest reasons
ever conjured.

i agree that an example must be
made that dirty rushing cannot be
tolerated, but was this the real
reason or was it personality clashes
and the wearing of black jackets.

If IFC wants irate as badly as
they claim, perhaps they should
spend more time helping the col-
onies by explaining the rules to
them and offering advice.

The colonies too, should actively
seek this advice. This bit with
little boys paying with their toys
has got to stop if the Greeks are
to start holding their own.

 

I THE nzz

by Lou Strong

When last I spoke to you i said
that i would spend this column
speaking of many of the new men
in jazz, the musicians that were
making all the good things happen.
Now i find that there is something
happening in this area thatdeserves
all the plugs it can get. Albany is
about to have its own JAZZ FES-
TIVALI

After begging, borrowing, steal-
ing, and a few other “ings” that!
won't mention here, Dennis Dono-
hue, Linda Lizik, and i have it-
nally been given the go-ahead to
start publicity and booking for what
will be the most fantastic musical
event on this campus. As a matter
of fact, the SUNYA Jazz Festival
will be among the five top festivals
in the country, both qualitatively
and quantitatively.

Among those to be here for the
May (3-7 weekend will be the Mei
Lewis-Tired Jones band, thought by
many to be the hottest band in the
jazz world today. At the present
time, they are working out of New
York City and will make the trip
to Albany for a concert on Satur-
day night. This band alone is worth
the price that you will pay for the
two concerts on Saturday.

Also on Saturday's program will
be the Jeremy Steig Quintet. This
group will definitely appeal to any
type of listener. We have planned
a Happening with Jeremy's group
for Saturday afternoon that is guar-

REVIEW

anteed to put the “fear of the Lord"
into the entire Saturday afternoon
audience.

I give you fair warning, however,
if you have a weak heart, DON’T
come to the happening. it will be
quite a shattering experience. New,
have I got your curiosity up? Goodi

The festival will encompass two
full days, May 6th and 7th with
concerts in the afternoons and eve-
nings of both days. Tickets will be
available to students 'and non-stu-
dents, with you wonderful student
tax payers getting first grabs. But
if you don’t buy them, we have more
than enough people who will. So
don’t wait for the last minute. Get
your tickets as soon as they go on
sale. People at State now have the
opportunity to hear some of the
best jazz that will ever hit the col-
lege scene, or the Albany scene.
Don't let it slip through your fin-
gers.

i’li be spending the next few
weeks telling you about the various
people that will be here for the
festival. People such as Herbie
Hancock (composer of“Watermel-
on Man”), Tony Williams (Miles
Davis' drummer), Don Friedman,
Nick Brignnia, Booker Erwin, and
many others will be at the Campus
Center for your enjoyment. Will
you be there?

The way it looks now i doubt if
there will be an empty sent in the
house. So, don’t delay for a minute.
The second you see tickets on sale,
BUYil See you at the Jazz Festival.

State Education Department which

m also has begun distribution of the

a much wider demand is already
developing for it.

Dr. Rienow recently was the fea-
tured speaker at the annual dinner
of the New York State Council for
the Social Studies gathered in con-
vention at Rochester. There he ad-
dressed some 600 teachers and ad-
ministrators on “New Outlooks on

F rinfa Lectures
0n Panel Painting

The use of decorations on Med—
ieval panel paintings to identify the
genuine works of the old master’s
was the main topic of Dr. Mojrnir
S. Frinta’s lecture last week. Frin-
ta, professor of art at the Univer-
sity, has received several research
grants to study mediean panel paint-
ings around the world. These paint-
ings were done in Italy and the sur-
rounding nrea of Europe during the
13th and Mill centuries.

The decorations were formed by
using punches made from ivory and
cast metal. According to Frinta,
these punches were handmade and
such master had his own. Silica the
master and his associates used only
their own punches the decorations
on the paintings are important clues
in identifying who is responsible
for what paintings now in art mu-
seums.

ir‘rmtn noted that since cnchpunch
was unique it is impossible for a
perfect forgery to be made. Frintn
also stated that in his research ire
has found seine paintings claimed
to he works of lhe mnstors by mu-
seums that he suspects to be either
imitations or forgeries.

The University has received I
$49,707 grant under the federal
Equal Educational Opportunities
Program in support of the project
for education of the disadvantaged
as part of the curriculum and in-
struction division of the Univer-
sity’s School of Education.

The institute, under the direction
of Dr. John A. Ether and Daniel
Ganeles, as associate director,pro-
vides a program for 25 teachers in
service and 30 college seniors who
are in teacher-preparation courses.
Receipt of the grant marks the third
year of support of the University
program under Title IV of the Civil
Rights Act of p964.

While there are approximately 30
other similar institutes throughout
the United States, the Albany Uni-
versity’s program is unique be-
cause pre-service preparation is
provided. The in-servics training
participants are being drawn from
the same school district as a pre-
condition of their employment.

A two-week summer live-in sem-
inar, in a controlled environment
setting, will be held for all partici-
pants, and a student-teaching pro-
gram will be offered to pro-service
participants during the senior year
which requires teaching experience
in a mixed racial school in the pro-
cess of integrating students and
curriculum.

Student teaching is followed up
one month for the remainder of the
academic year for continuing ex-
perience and support. The seminar
is designed to improve the ability
of teachers to deal effectively with
special educational problems oc-
casioned by school desegregation.

instructional costs are paid by

supposed layer. The lever insists
that they had an affair last year,
“perhaps at Marienbad," but the
woman has no recollection of the
man. His persistence finally con-
vinces her that an affair must have
taken place, and she leaves with
him.

Director Reenais employed un-
usual techniques in filming this
story. Photographed in black and
white, each scene was a magni-
ficently composed picture in itself.
Actors were employed in construct-
ing the scenes as much as the con-
ventional elements of scenery.

The enigmatic quality of the photo-
graphy serves to emphasize to un-
derlying mystery of the play. Asked
if the young woman actually had an
affair with the young man, author
Alain Robbe-Griilet said no. Di-
rector Resnais said es.
