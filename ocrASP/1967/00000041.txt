At that banquet Warren was

the main topics of dis-
cussion at Monday’ a Presi-
dent’s Conference.

Dr. Clifton i‘norne, vice Presi-
dent for Student Affairs, announced
that the Student Affairs Personnel
have presently ironed out all the
mechanical difficulties involved in
uniting the proposal into effect, and
hat the system can go into effect
is soon as a question posed recently
by the Student Affairs Council has
been worked out.

The consideration of the question
posed by the Student Affairs Council
may present an unexpected holdup
in the institution of the proposal.

The question raised concerns the
mom] obligation of the University
to parents of girls attending the
University in making a ruling con-
cerning their welfare effective in
the middle of a semester when the
parents are in effect powerless.

Thorno said he did not know ex-
actly how big the problem is, or
how long it would hold up the enact-
ment of the policy; however he felt
it would be at least a week. He is
presently talking with those people

who raised the questions.

composed of Richard Taylor, Lewis
Fischer, and Stratton Rawson, mem-
bers of the Committee to Win the
War. The negative constructive
speeches centered on the argument
that America's “present policy"
is one of negotiation.

The affirmative argument focused
on three points. Carmichael gave
support for the theory that Ameri-
cans are mistaken in believing that
the National Liberation Front is
controlled by CommUnists. Gaes
attempted to prove the Domino
theory invalid and Miringoff asked
for proof that the North Vietnamese
are actually the aggressors. '

Oi Fossil Beds

Study and discovery of about fifty
new fossil localities on the rocks
of the Columbia County region was
done by Dr. John H. Bird, associate
professor of geology at the Univer-
sity, in association with Dr. Franco
Itasetti, professor of nuclear phy-
sics at Johns Hopkins University.

The work, currently being pub-
iished in several scientific jour-
nals, was supported by the Geologi-
cal~ Society of America and the
American Philosophical Society.

The fossils, belongingtoth'e Cam-
brian Period of geologic time, range
from appoximatoly 000 to 600 mil-
lion years in ago.

Most of the fossils found are re-
mains of trilobites, marine animals
that became extinct about 225 mil-
lion years ago. Some of the trilo-
bites are the first of their kind to
be found anywhere in the world.

Although a lethal the newly dis-
covered fossii localities ooritnln
trilobites long known to be present
on the rocks east of the lludm
Valley, from the Vermont border
to around Rensseiaer and Columbia
counties, most of the fossils foam
had not been known previouly to
occur anywhere in New York Eda
or New England.

The newly discovered fossllahnvn
proved to be extremely valuable to
geologists in that they reveal the
age of various kinds of rocks of tin
region.

Also, the fossils enable geologists
to correlate geologic evonts otthe

parts of New England, and of the

After the alternate constructive
speeches by the members of both
sides the floor was given to mem-
bers of the audience for pro and

morality of the war and ofthe bomb-
ing was brought up by a number of
speakers.

Taylor answered by asking for
the difference between a bomb de-

and one delivered by a delivery boy
in South Viet Nam.

Speakers from the floor also asked
if we were supplying the Vietnamese
with an “acceptable alternative" to
