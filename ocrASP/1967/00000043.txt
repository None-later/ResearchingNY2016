‘ ing on Alumni Quad the Council will
be faced with a problem of how to
represent them. Cleveland hypothe-
sized that the freshmen will hold
their own elections in October or
November of next semester. The
Council has not yet decided how or
when the freshmen will be admitted
though.

Central Council is the most-pow-
erful atlllent organization on the
campus of this University. The stu-
dents who sit on the Council have
control over most of the major so-
cial, economic and political aspects
of student life. All the chairs of
the students who represent the resi-
dents and commuters. will be up for
election this May.

Central Council is the apex of the
hierarchical pyramid of the Student
Association. Subject to the Council
are the commissions,'the Greeks,
and all Student Association funds.
Each commission is allowed to elect
two oi its members to Central Coun-
cil. in theory, each commission rep-
resentative is to represent the body
he was elected by.

These commission representa-
tives usually work their way up the
ladder in the commissions. There-
fore the student who sits on the
Council representing Religious Af-

fairs Commission is also active in
the religious activities on_and off
the campus. For this reason, the
commission members on the Coun-
cil have double the amount of work
to do. They must fulfill their re-
sponsibilities to Central Council
and the organizations within their
commission.

Central Council also includes five
representatives from the faculty
and administration. These people
do not sit on the Council as ad-
visors but as voting members. From
these members, the Council is able
to communicate with the faculty and
administration with greater ease

work together each year in forming
the Supreme Court. People nom-
inating themselves for Supreme
Court willhave their applications
screened by MYSKANlA. From these
nominees MYSKANlA will r‘ecom-
mend to Central Council the Su-

preme Court Justices for the comm

ing year. It is then up to Central
Council to approve these nominees
or to reject them as a group. if
the group is rejected then the
screening begins again. in order
for a justice to be recalled, three-
iourths of the membership oi Cen-
tral Council and MYSKANIA must
vote for the recall oi the justice.

Council MembersAnticipate
More Efficiency In Future

by Jill Poznik

Most members of Central Council feel that the Stu,-
dent Government is working effectively now, how-
ever, its effectiveness they feel will increase as the
number of students attendingthe University increases.

' The present council was designed with the future

The Pan-Hellenic Council, the

group representing both the sor-
orities and fraternities, is repre-
sented by two students. Like mem--
bers oi the Council from the com-
missions these two representatives
are involved in work of the group
they represent.
' The rationale behind the theory
tha. these twelve members of Cen-
tral Council should come from the
commissions and the Greeks is that
this method would insure a good
representation of the many interests
on campus. it can also be seen that
there is a good chancethat the mem-
bers who rise to the Councilthrough
the hierarchy will also be “work-
ers" on Central Council.

According to William Cleveland,
Central Council President, there
will be about eleven representatives
to be popularly elected later this
month. The eleven will, as plans
for the election have not yetcrystal-
ized, probably conEIst oi three each
from Dutch Quad, Colonial Quad and
the commuters as well as two from
State Quid.

Within three weeks, students will
know in what quadrangle they will
be living in. if a student wishes to
run for Central Council, he must
content for a seat determined by his
residence. If he will live off cam-

pus, he must run as a commuter.
if he lives on a quadrangle, he must
run from the quadrangle in which he
will live.

it has not yet reached its
prime but is becoming
more effective as the Uni—
versity expands.

Last year the Central Council
was concerned with its organiza-
tion; this year it has started to
govern and increase its efficiency.
Because'the government was new
last year, in the opinion of William
Cleveland, chairman of Central
Council, more interest was taken in
it, and now that the government has
settled down to function properly,
the interest has subsided.

Interested Members

Doug Upham believes that the
same proposals would have been
introduced and passed more effi-
ciently with only the interested
members of Central Council were
on it, however he realizes that if
the government was run by only
interested people studentbody would
be wary of its representation.

Joe Mahay feels that “the gov-
ernments operates as a bureauc-
racy," however, the general idea
of decentralization into boards and
committees is good.

"one of the reasons why student
government doesn’t give more force
to its decisions," believes Mahay
"is because the administration is
quite liberal." It seems that the
administration has not blocked many
major Central Council proposals.
Therefore, “there is no overwhelm-
ing need for more force."

Mahay approves of the Council's
new interest and expression in the
field of politics, both local and na-
tional.

More Referendum:

Mahay feels that more referenu
dums concerning political issues
would make the political concerns
of the University known locally and
nationally. lie would like, as he has
said before, SUNYA at Albany to be
more in the news as Berkeley is
now. Now there is a referendum in
the making concerning Viet Nam.
"Hopefully," says Mahay, “it will
create some thought.”

When asked if Central Council
planned any major proposals or
changes, Mahay said that the type
of student at this University “is
not one who wants chan80.Thatcon-
alder the University as their ticket
to a good job and this is all the
student wants."

For the future Mahay would like
to see a “revision of the under—
graduate program." A Seminar of
the Undergraduate Curriculum has

increase in the student body in mind. For this reason

hay feels they are working well.
Religious Affairs, after having some
problems, has straightened itself
out; Communications Commission
never had any problems and
L.A.A.S. is doing all right.

Never Lacks Quorum

Now the Central Council, as op-
posed to the former Senate, “Never
lacks a quorum.” Major policy is
discussed at each meeting, owing
to the fact that by the time a bill
comes to the Council it has been
worked over enough so that it is
presented in an organized form
and discussion on the substance of
the bill may immediately proceed.

The de-emphasis of boards of the
Commissions in the recent past will,
it seems, continue in the future.
Academic Affairs Commission has,
suspended its boards because, says
Debbie Friedman, the people in
honoraries are not interested
enough. Therefore, rather than have
the boards elect their representa-
tives, they will be directly elected
from each academic organization.

Cleveland would like to see a bill
passed in the future allowing the
chairman of Central Council to vote
only in case of a tie. As it now
stands, the chairman isafull-votlng
member. '

Cleveland started out as co-chalr-
man of Parents Day and was placed
on Special Events Board for which
he became representative to Com-
munity Programming Commission.
From here he was elected as rep-
resentative to CentralCouncll where
he now holds the position of chair—
man. lie is still a member of all
these committees and must be in

Cleveland would like to see the
necessity of maintaining all former
positions abolished so that greater
time and effort can be given to the
higher levels. A student referendum
would take place in reference in ab-

solvlng the chairman's full vote and ‘

the holding of his former positions.

Elected at Large

in order for the student body to
be more fully represented on the
Council in the future, Vincent
Abramo suggests increasing the
number of members on the Council
by having eight 0 ton students
elected at large by if e studentbody.
“They would circulate around cam-
pus and give their information and
opinion at each Central Council
meeting." They would also partici-
pate in the committees.

Another suggestion by Abrnmo is
that the Presithnt and Vice Presi-
dent of Student Association be pop.
ularly elected. ‘= '

feel they cannot glve ade-

so they could devote more

Speaking for L.A.A.C., Robert
Mulvey feels "the problems that
L.A.A.C. has had, have not been
with Central Council at all.” He
says that though both L.A.A.C. and
Central Council pass legislation,
they do not do so in the same areas,
and Central Council has not tried
to move into the area over which
L.A.A.C. legislates.

Central Council Developed From Weak Senate
To Govern Rapidly Growing University Community

Central Council will be completing
two years of work next month. The
need for establishing a new govern-
ment became obvious to the students
in the old governing body, Student
Senate, by Spring of 1964. The
evolution of Student SenateintoCen-
trai Council took place within that
your and a half.

Under the old form ofgovernmcnt
each class elected a set number of
its students to the Student Senate.
Deborah Friedman, who wnsolcctcd
to that last Seunte, stated that about
fifty freshmen ran for the sixteen
positions that were open tothc class
of ’07. Each class was given equal
representation on the now defunct
senate.

The Student Senate was, in the
words of Michael Purdy, "a social
club, a place to show off new
clothes, passing notes and finding
out who was going out with who."
Needless to say, many of the mem-
bers of the Senate were socialitos

twho were not, according to Fried-

man, interestad in the government.

Need for Change

Friedman gave much of the credit
for the impetus of change to theln-
creasing size of the University.
Realizing this factor, the students
interested in government met in the
spring of 1964i todiscuss what should
be the goals and rasponsibllltiea of

 

an effective governing body. This
meeting included representatives
from the faculty and administration,
who were interested In the formation
of a new and effective gtmq-mnoni.

The results of thin ('miici'cncv
became evident in the full, 'l‘horo
was an almost unanimous fur-ling
among the students on the Senate.
in February of 1965 Arthur Julius-
lou, president of the last Sonniu,
announced the results of :1 student
referendum on the question of it
new government.

Interim Government

The interim governinoni bocnmo
known as Provisional Council and
Joseph Mainly, presently 41 senior
and a member of Control Counr-ii,
was chosen as chairman. in addi—
tion to being responsible for curry-
lllii on the regular business I'l'tt-
vlsionnl Council had to who :1 non
constitution.

Friedman stated that the Pro—
visionul Council did a phonomonnl
amount of work that spring. it had
l0 prepare a constitution that wzu
acceptable to everyone. There was
a conflict for a time on whether the
unicarmeral or the blcarmorni typi-
of government should be used. A
decision on this matter and many
others had to he reached by lilo
members of the Provisional Coun—

, Provisional Council completed the

new constitution for the inspection
by the student body in late April
of that very same spring. On April
30 the members of the Student
.Association voted to accept the new
constitution. Campaigning for the
new positions began immediately.
The campaigns reached their climax
just before the elections on May 10

Richard Thompson was elected
the first president of Central Coun-
cil by his fellow members. It be-
came the job of this first Central
Council to put the new constitution
into practice that next September
Central Council finally became a
reality.

    

picture

sentatlve of L.A.A.C., believes the
government is working as efficiently
as it can with the amount of people
it works with. “Perhaps it would
work more efficiently with less
people, however, it would be less

 

 

representative."

She says it is the same people in
all organizations that are doing all
the work.

Dan Dubin, former chairman of
Religious Affairs Commission, be-
lieves that Central Council is mov-
ing in the right direction, butsome-
times they run too much. He thinks
the new interest in taking apolitical
position is good.

The government, he says, has not
yet reached its prime and will work
more effectively as the University
grows. “in five years the govern-
ment should be functioning effec-
tively." He suggested that a fresh
outlook must be constantly renewed
by changing officers.

No Awareness

Sue Budd, chairman of Communi-
cations Commission agrees with
Cleveland’s proposal to pass a bill
relating to the numerous groups to
which one must belong in order to
retain his position on Central Coun-
cil, “Representatives to the Council
are not fully aware of what each of
their groups is doing. They must
deal with too many groups. They
cannot do a good job with each group
and to Central Council." "This
doesn't end up in good leadership,"

Commission Heads Suggest 
To Improve Student GoVernmentl‘

In the opinion of the heads of the Commissions ‘represented on Central Council.
the present government is working efficiently, however, there are a number of
problems that must still be solved. It was suggested that its efficiency might be
increased if there were fewer people on the Council, who held a greater interest
in reference to their respective Commissions. It was also proposed that the mem-
bers of the Council be changed regularly in order for a fresh outlook to continue.

although Budd believes the present
government to be much more effec-
tive than the former Senate."

"The structure is good for a co-
ordinating system; it just needs
time and effort."

Sharyn Teves, former chairman
of Community Programming Com-
mission, belleves that "Central
Council is not hilly aware of what
committees are doing and vice
versa. The Cabinet meetings are
pretty effective and do help.

  

COUNCIL MEMBERS listen attentively to important matters at
meetings as opposed to disorder
at the former Senate meetings.

One idea she suggests is that "it
may possibly be beneficial for invi-
tations to be extended to members
and subservient organizations, and
you boards, outside the regular rep-
resentatives within each commis-
sion, to the meetings of the Council.

Mildred Poisenki, present chair-
man of the Commission, found that
when they’ve asked for aid or ad-
vice, or sent things to the Council,

they have been handled quickly and '

efficiently.
