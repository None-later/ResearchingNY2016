COMMUNICA TIONS

Hall Commended

To the Editors:
I Wish to congratulate the men of
. Johnson Hall on their decision to
lend moral and financial support
for the establishment of a Johnson
Hall Chamber Music Society.
Certainly this indicates something
which was commonly supposed tobe
lacking at our University -astudent
initiated encouragement of the fine
arts. Johnson Hall’s exemplary ac-
tion is both extraordinary and com-
mendablo.

To the Editors:

One gets the impression that
among our symmetrical colonnades
it almost enhances'one’s prestige
‘to be in favor of equal educational
facilities, economic opportunities,
and political power for black Amer-
icans. Yet, many of the same stu-
dents and professors who espouse
these lofty ideals turn their backs
and silently assent to a bloody and
’systematlc program in Southeast
Asia.

With their silence, they advocate
genocidal murder by and for Amer-
icans as a means of implementing
America's foreign policy. Last week
a series of workshops were con-
ducted on this campus. The facts

about our holy war in Viet Nam
were discussed. As history was re-
told, the ways in.whlch each of us
can add our voices to the growing

chorus of dissent were reviewed.,

Only a tiny handful of my fellow
students and teachers were inter-
ested enough to appear. Last week
I read in the paper the name of a
man I knew more than a decade
ago in Central Texas. He was a
fighter pilot, and I helped to teach
him his trade. He died in a ﬂaming
jumble of junk aluminum in the
Mekong Delta.

Before his death he flew a num-
ber of missions, and on those mis-
sions he burned to death, withiellied
gasoline, a number of men, women,
and children. No one knows for sure
how many. Ihelped to make him one
of the most effective mass mur-
derers in the history of 'humanity.

Each of my fellow students and
teachers who knew that his acts of
war were wrong and yet did not
raise their voices inprotest allowed
him to practice his trade. Each of
them is responsible with me.

Sometimes it is hard toknow what
one can do to protest the atrocities
against mankind that are beingcom-
mitted in our names. Saturday, April
fifteenth is not one of those times.
A peace convocation is going to be
held that day in Central Park, New
York City.

 

Fourth Time Around

by Igor Koroiuk

After seeing Eric Anderson at
Siena about three weeks ago, I
realized I'm going to have to eat
my words. I. don't mean he wasn’t
good, he was excellent as a matter
of fact. In a previous column l
wrote on how Eric has remained
pure in the face of “folk-rock,”
but on Saturday, March ll, he ap-
peared backed up by drums, piano,
and electric bass.

Since I went to the concert ex-
pecting a great deal, being Ander-
son is one of my personal favor-
ites, I was shocked but not disap-
pointed. A great deal of work had
gone into arranging his songs for
the groups. Generally they came
through very well, without really
becoming "rock." '

‘ Hidtllghts of Concsrt

Highlights of the concert, which
was made do of about half old tunes
and half new material, were some
of his new works. lwas especially
impressed with his blues solo

from Dave Von Rock.

Both his voice and very fine

suitor playing excelled in their poise.

arranged ballad with the piano,bass
and Andersen's guitar combining for
a melody background reminiscent of
the Lovin' Spoonful's "Butchie's
Tune." During a musical interlude
in the tune Debbie Green on piano
took over with a Jazz arrangement
which to my untrained sense of
rhythm sounded like five/four time,
an accomplishment of no little merit
especially in a folk tune.

On the Light Side

The sad thing about the concert
was the undeniable presence of

Rose, ever awe-struck by the ar-
tists' presence. it was unfortunate
to have such an audience especially
when the devilish, boyish charm of
Eric Anderson was so easy to iden-
tify with. Also, the volume of An-
dersen's microphone could have
been higher. Those not familiar with
the lyrics of his songs would have

Another snag'may halt the women’s hours proposal

disputes the fact that it is an issue to be considered. ‘
This issue is whether or not the parents should be
informed of the change before it is enacted.

« sidered before this .point when we are again so close.
The question arose during the past two weeks and the
administrators have been considering it. They could
think about it some more. They could decide to write
informative letters to all or some of the parents or

Why didn’t some one raise this moral issue before?

Why didn’t we?

Still another reasoh why we might still be able to
enact the proposal if the University Council approves
it is as an experiment. Perhaps if the change in our-
few were tried and then letters were sent, some par-
ents might be more receptive after they knew how the
proposal worked rather than immediate rejection of
a proposal that exists on paper.

Broadway’s Tonys Viewed By Critic
As Excellent, Exciting Performance

by Ellis Kaufman

Broadway’s most coveted hon-
ors--the Tony Awards for the best
shows and performances of the sea-
son were awarded on nationwide
television on Easter Sunday for the
first time in their history.

Mary Martin and Robert Preston,
stars of "I Do, 1 Del” co-hosted
the live color .telecast which orig-
inated from the Schubert Theatre
where the musical “The Apple
Tree" is playing currentlv.

Reporter Arrives

When I got to Eighth Avenue and
44th Street for the Tony presenta-
tion, I looked up the street and was
astonished to see the entire street
red carpeted.

As I walked up the street, a band
was playing songs from "Mame,
a searchlight was probing the skies,
and thousands of interested on-
lookers watched from behind police
barricades.

When I arrived, no one, absolutely

no one, was being admitted to the .

theatre. Cadillacs were arriving by
the dozens dropping off such people
as Harry Belafonte, Richard Cham-
berland, Barbra Streisand, the en-
tire cast of “Cabaret,” Gwen Ver-
don and many others. They all had
to wait outside with everyone else.

There was a very informal at-
mosphere inside the theatre cul-
minating in Alexander Cohen's (the
producer) calling of the role to see
if all the nominees were inside.

Prior to the telecast, two awards
were presented, both going to my
favorite show-- "Cabaret." These
were best costume designer and best
scenic designer. The best composer
and lyricist award wentto the people
responsible for "Cabaret" and the
best director of a dramatic play
award to Peter Hall for "’I‘heilome-
coming.”

The telecast began with the “Wil-
kommen" number from “Cabaret”
featuring Joel Gray. After seeing
“Cabaret” twice I was more than
happy to see tilts marvelous number
again. Later, Mr. Grey won the
award for the best supporting actor
in a musical.

Desi supporting awards in the field
of dramatic plays went to ion lloiln

Yale Band To Give

. Sunday Performance

Tile Yale University Band under
the direction of Keith \vtlson will
perform at the invitation of the
Music Council on Sunday, April 9
at 4 p.m. in Page llnll.

Considered axle of the best of its
kind in the country, the Yale Band

nition on three highly successful
European tours.

in “The Homecoming” and to Mar-
ian Seldes in “A Delicate Balance.”

Excellent Performance

Following the presentation of the
above awards by John Forsythe and
Lee Remick, Barbara Harris per-
formed the “Movie Star-Gorgeous"
number from "The Apple Tree."
There are no words to explain how
good she was and ii is no wonder
that she received the Best Actress
in a musical play award for her
performance.

Lauren Bacall, star of “Cactus
Flower," presented the award for
the Best Actor in a Dramatic Play
to Paul Rogers of "The Home-
coming." Kirk Douglas presented
the same award for an actress to
Beryl Reid for her performance in
“The Killing of Sister George."

Before David Merrick presented
the award for the best dramatic
play to Harold Pinter for his play
"The Homecoming," Mary Martin
and Robert Preston performed the
"Nobody's Perfect” number from
their vehicle, "I Dol I Doi" Miss
Martin has improved marvelously
since her last time on Broadway
as “Jenny.” Mr. Preston, the"Mu-
sic Man" is as good if not better
than his past performances.

Supporting Actress Surprise

1 was very surprised when Peg
Murray won the best supporting ac-
tress award for her performance
as the whore, in "Cabaret". When
she accepted she seemed as surl—
prised as I was.

Harry Belafonte presented the
Tony to Ronald Field who did the
choreography for "Cabaret," fol-
lowed by the “Walking Happy” num-
her from the show of the same name.
Norman Wisdon was very fulmy but
the number was sloppy and was hurt
by such minor catastrophes on stage
as a falling cart.

Carol Burnett gave the Tony to
Harold Prince for his direction of
"Cabaret", Zero Mostol presented
the Tony to Barbara Harris for “The
Apple Tree," and dear sweet Mame

If anyone ever tells you that the

job of assistant director-stage man- '

agar of the State University Revue
.is an easy and relaxingiob, tell them
they're crazy. You suddeniybecome
warden, den mother, adviser, pc-
liceman, and pal to a family of 30.
It's really not so bad, considering
that the family of 30 includes some
of the .most loyal, talented, fun-
loving kooks on campus.

Entire Production in Student Hands
The thing that really makes CAR-
NIVAL exciting to be a part of, is
the proud fact that ever aspect of
the show is student designed, di-
rected, and executed. Instead of ob-
taining sets and costumes from New
York, we are fortunate enough to en-
list the services of Paula Michaels
and John Deanehan.

Miss Michaels, an undergraduate
assistant to Mr. Robert Donnelly,
has designed and is in the process
of executing all of the costumes;
Mr. Deanehan, also an undergrad-
uate assistant, has designed all the
CARNIVAL sets and is in charge
of all the crew work.

Newcomers to the Revue are John
Webb and Kathleen O’Neil. Mr.
Webb, the musical conductor, is a
member of the statesmen and a
member of the CARNIVAL chorus
as well. Miss O’Neil is a talented
freshman dancer who is taking the
chores of choreography. She had
the enormous task of creating the
“CARNIVAL BALLET."

Yale Hosts Drama Festival
Potential Not Fully Realized

by Rina Sussmon

The Eleventh Annual Yale Festival of Drama held
yearly to promote communication of theatre ideas
among college students active in this medium, took
place March 21-23 at the Yale University Campus in
New Haven. This year’s participants included college
groups from Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts. Mary—
land, New Jersey. New York. Ohio, and Canada.

Guest lecturers are in-
vited in an attempt to cor-
relate developments in
commercial and education—
al theatre with whatunder-
graduates themselves are
doing.

This year the keynote speaker
was actor William Redfield and the
main critic was the noted John Si-
mon. Michael Smith, editor of the
“Village Voice," and Kenneth
Brown, author of the play “The
Brig,” participated in some of the
discussion-evaluation groups which
followed each bill of plays.

Well-Known Scripts

Aside from the production of well-
kncwn scripts, the Festival encour-
ages the production and discussion
of original plays by student play-
wrights. These works offer per-
haps the best insight into all as-
pects of undergraduate theatrical
experience.

The potential of the Festival is
iillmeusurahie. Unfortunately it was
not fully realized this year. The
productions, the acting, and the
original scripts failed to stir 'en-
thusiastic responses. The number
of successes, such as "Home Free"
by Syracuse University, was sorely
missing.

It is surprising and disappointing
that the new concept of total theatre
us being total experience was not
explored. In only two cases, "Don-
nor" by Emerson College, and “oh,
What A Lovely Warl” by Rollins
College, was an attempt made to
combine media, as both used film
strips in the productions, As a first
step, this is an admirable attempt.

No Coherent Unity
Unfortunately the effort failed
completely in the latter because
there was no coherent unity estab-
iished between the medium of the

play and the medium of the film.

It was disconcerting to find that
the established works were not me-
turely understood. Specifically,
“The Brig" by Kenneth Brown was
interpreted and played as a comical
farce. The interpretation would be
excusable and perhaps commend-
able and valid had the dialogue been
ambiguous and suggestive of sundry
connotations.

However, the power and mean-
ingfulness of this play lies in the
militaristic pattern of life which
the script demands and which here
was haphazardly and carelessly ex-
ecuted by the Ohio State Players.

like vacation,
ams, CARNIVAL's clos
rehearsals promise to be very'.try-
ing, hectic, and exciting ones.'~

The' show is beautifully written, .
the. songs are lilting, and the cast
and crews are the best ever. Every-
one who still belleves in carnivals,
clrcuses, and spring fever should

come to CARNIVAL; if you don't "

believe, come anyway, you may
change.

Critic Predicts'
No Real Upsets
In Oscar Race

by Douglas Rating-b

it is at Oscar time, I am sure,
that the film critics gets the big-
gest chance to make a whoppingfool
of himself. But whatever the reason,
be it masochism, paranoia, or any.
number of assorted reasons, once
a year each and every critic takes
the ignoble plunge and comes out
with his list of predicted Oscar
winners.

This year’s Oscars, however, give
cause for optimism. For seldom has
the Os ar race been less of a race
than th 5 year.

The picture of the year, to nearly
everybody’s mind, is Fred Zinne-
man’s “A Man For All Season's,"
and as usual, that film should walk
away with most of the honors. The
only other contender, and not a
flimsy one by any means, is War-
ner’s "Who’s Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?"

“A Man For All Season's," be-
side winning as best picture, should
also bring home the glory for di-
rector Zinneman, screen-writer
Robert Bolt, for color cinematog-
raphy and color costume.

The acting categories provide a
good deal more excitement, for the
competition is stiff. Still, Elizabeth
Taylor should win easily for
"Woolf," and Paul Schofield for
"Seasons." Supporting actor and
actress should go, respectively, to
Walter Matthau (Fortune Cookie),
and Jocelyne LaGarde (Hawaii).

Best foreign language film should
be the immensely popular "A Man
and A Woman," and the best orig-
inal screenplay should be for An-
tonioni's "Blow-Up."

Fox’s "Fantastic Voyage” should
sweep the special effects field, al-
though the award for best sound
should go to Frankenhelmer’s
"Grand Prix.”

The best original musical score
will probably be “Born Free" by
the phenomenal composer John Bar-
ry. The best original song, however,
should be “Alfie,” although "Born
Free" has a very good chance.
And to that you can add “Georgy
Girl" as a very dark horse.
