 none of theVUmverpity’s coaches. We made

stolen on the basis of who has done the most to

we’re sure, a surprise to no f one — Joe Garcia.

Now in. his 17th year at Albany, Coach Garcia is
responsible 'for‘ instituting both-wrestling and soccer
at the University. He cOached the first varsity soccer
team in 1950 and organized a wrestling program sev—
eral years later. -

V ‘ A native of St. Louis, Garcia receivedhis Bachelor’s

degree from the University of Illinois audparticipated
in four national collegiate tournaments with the III-
inois wrestling teams. After graduation, he became ~
assistant coach at Ohio State before coming to Albany
where he assumed his new post and received his
Master’s degree. 

Garcia has to be singled out as the most hardest
working of all the coaches. He is the only one on the
staff to coach a sport in each season--varsity soccer,
_in the fall, varsity wrestling in the winter, and frosh
tennis in the spring; This much activity requires an
undue amount of stress and strain besides patience
and integrity which the likeable coach has endured
every year. And there seems no signs in the future
of his shying away from any of these most important
responsibilities.

Besides coaching three sports, Garcia is coordi-
nator of varsity athletics for the University, Chair-
man of the NCAA Soccer Development and Clinics
Committee, a member of the NCAA, Honor Award
Committee, and Section 2 area chairman for the
New York State Wrestler. A man of only Garcia’s
caliber has enough energy and devotion to work ef-
fectively and efficiently for all these activities.

While coaching his athletes, Mr. Garcia takes a
very active part in his work. He not only explains
what the individual"is doing wrong but demonstrates
what he is doing, why it is wrong, and how it should
be corrected.

In soccer, he always participates in intra—squad
scrimmages occasionally stopping practice tocorrect
individual weaknesses or to point out where better
teamwork could have been used.

We personally have come to respect Mr. Garcia’s
integrity through his recent hard work that he has put

into the 1967—68 athletic budget which is currently
being debated by the Athletic Advisory Board. In
every way, Coach Garcia represents a symbol of the
University which every present and future athlete
should look up to. '

Albany Nine Hopeful;
Pitching Depth Is Key

    

The Albany State base—.
ball nine will open their
season Thursday against
Utica, with a greatly ex-
panded pitching staff and
hopes for ahighly success—
ful sea'son.

Coach Burlingame who was re-
stricted to a mere two pitchers most
of last season, now finds himself
with six strong mound candidates.
Torn Egelslon, a powerful righiy,
and Tom Piotrowski, a southpaw
knickleballer are both returning.
These two will be assisted this year
by a return to action of senior Jim
Nass, who sat out last year with a
sore arm.

Joining these three lettermen will
be transfer Cass Galka, a mainstay
at Hudson Valley for the last two
years; big George Webb, last year’s
outstanding freshmen; and soph Rich
Patrol, who showed promise in the
summer league last year.

The hurlers will be supported on
the left side by veterans Andy Chris-

tian at third and Denny Elkin at
short. First and second are still up
for grabs, with Paul Leonetti and
Hal Toretzsky in contention at sec-
ond. First will go to Jack Sinnott or
Webb when he is not on the mound.

The outfield is also unsettled.
Jim Murley, a transfer from Hud-
son Valley, Gordon Johnson, also a
reserve catcher, Bob Lowell, cen-
ter fielder on the frosh last year,
and Webb are all candidates.

Catching duties will be handled
by another sophomore,Gary Torino.
Coach Burlingame cites defense and
a lack of depth as potential weak-
nesses. However Christian, Elkln,
Sinnott and Webb have all been look-
ing good at the plate, and their hit-
ting coupled with the strengthened
pitching staff assure a much better
season than last year.

Coach Burlingame citing the fact
that Nass and Christian are the
only seniors is even looking for-
ward to possible district contention
for the College division World Ser-
ies that will be instituted next year.

Tennis Captain Zacharias
Sixteen Wins In Two Years

by Glen Sapir

Ken Zacharias picked up
a tennis racket for the first
time when he was in the
eighth grade in South Glens
Falls, and he hasn’t done
much except win with it
since.

The twenty-two year old senior

first tried his hand at competitive
tennis the next year, his first of
four seasons of varsity play at
South High. ,
During ills high school varsity
career, “Zack,” as he is called
by his friends, collected many hon-
ors because of his skill on both the
basketball and tennis courts.

Ken's junior year was his most
rewarding season at South High.
That year, zack won his conference
tennis championship and finished as
high as runnerup in the Section 2
Tournament. In his sophomore and
senior years, Zack finished second
to his teammate, Larry Miller.

Miller, who now plays as num-
ber one man Oswogo, lost to
Zacharias in their collegiate clash
last season. At south High, the two
combined for ducanfercnca doubles
championship, for two years. The
high school has never lost a con-
ference match in seventy three coa—

As a sophomore, Zack played the consists or Arm, a squad that will

The junior season was split between
the number i and 2 position. The
only two losses of Zack's varsity
career came when he was playing
the number one position, that is
while he was playing the best the
opposition had to offer.

When asked what he thought of
this year's team, the varsity cap-
tain replied, "This looks to be the
best team since i have been here.
This year’s squad has lots ofdepth."

When Ken speaks of, his own so-
complishments, he is quick to ack-
nowledge that “Through the efforts
of my high school tennis coach,
Stuart Bterns, who is a formic pro,
1 had an excellent opportunity to be
exposed to all the'facels of the
game.”

All play and no work is the ex-
ception for most college students,
and Ken is certainiyho exception.
As a biology major, Ken is kept
busy with a heavy schedule. Fur-
thermore, as a member of Alpha Pi
Alpha fraternity, Zack is kept busy
in his executive office.

Bowen was named on all nine

, ballots and little wonder. The back-

court dead-eye peppered the nets

. for 33 points in a 79-64 Montclair

victory over visiting Albany early
in the season. His output was by far
the most markers scored by an

individual against State this year. Q)

Palinski and Eberle each re-
ceived six votes from the State
cagers. Mark, who established a
number of scoring records at Siena
this season, tallied 28 points as his
lndians split two games with the
Great Danes. He garnered just four
in Siena's 73-67 victory in the Cap-
ital District Tourney final, sitting
out much of the game with foul
trouble. He netted 24 in the '76-'75
overtime win later in the year and
played a strong all-around game.

Eberle burned the Danes for 43
points in UB’s two triumphs over
Albany.

Relying on the shooting of Dave
Goldslein and Larry Meyers and
the rebounding of Jerry Saperstone,
the lrondequoit lndlans defeated EE P
11, 48-45, in overtime Tuesday night
for the championship in the Com-
missioner’s Tournament held at
Page Gym. .3

Goldstein poured in 15 of his
team's 24 points in the first half as
the iron l's led 24-20. Goldstein’s
points came on deadly outside shots
and hard-driving lay-ups. He fin-
ished with a game high of 23 points.

Meyers who ended up with 15
markers hit 6 foul shots in a row
at the end of the game and in the
overtime period. The score was
tied 41-41 at the end of regulation
time.

Saperstone pulled down 18 re-
bounds in controlling both the of-
fensive and defensive boards. He
scored 6 points.

Paced by Joe LaReau and Mike
Conway, Potter stormed from an
8 point deficit to cut the lead to
one and eventually knot the score.
But Meyer’s foul shooting proved
too much for the twice beaten EEP’s
had got into the finals by upsetting
APA I, 59-58.

Conway finished with 15 points,
as Owen Coffer added 12 and LaReau
10.

The champs finished with a 14-3
record with a strong bench headed
by Robert Rodway being a strong
factor throughout the season.

“Drop-out -— Turn-on
——Tune-in -— Drop-out ——
Turn—on -- Turn-in,” re—

peated Dr. Timothy Leary
during his meeting with
narcotics expert, Dr. Don-
ald Louria at the R.P.I.
Field House Saturday night.

Leary's 45 minute presentation
which he gave while sitting cross-
legged on the floor in front of a
lighted cancle, centered around a
comparison between life and a tele-
vision studio. Leary stated that the
central news room of a T.V. studio
is located inside olle’s body.

Leary said that using LSD is the
key to opening up one’s insides and
"finding out what’s going on."Thls,
he explained, is not wanted by the
“directors of the T. V. studio."

Leary warned that no one should
“take the trip” who was "not pre-
pared" for the changes that would
take place after his “return.”

Leary ended his presentation by
chanting, "make it better, don’t be
afraid, keep it going, you’re divinity,
you’re God.” He never listed the
dangers of LSD or any of the other
thing which he claims the drug ac-
complishes.

Dr, Donald Louria, President of
the New York State Councillor Drug
Addition, began his presentation with
some straight forward facts on the
medical uses of LSD.

Louria also mentioned the five
claims that the advocates of LSD
make. He listed 1) creativity 2)
mystical experiences 3) loveable-
ness 4) insight and 5) potent aphro-
disiac effect. Louria stated that
these claims either weren't true
or could not be proven.

Louria discussed the dangers of
LSD including the recent evidence
discovered by Dr. Cohen in Buffalo
that LSD causes chromosomal
breaks.

Louria stated that individuals
should move ill and attack problems
to make the world of tomorrow :1
better place than the world of today
instead of "dropping-out.”

The world around Giuliana is fall—

Purpose of the committee will be
to provide for independent faculty

melllods used to obtain informed
consent, and the risks and potential
medical benefits of the investiga-
tions.

Dr. Collins stated that the com-
mittee will be guided ill its work
by the campus position regarding
investigations involving human sub-
jects.

Dr. Collins has advised that rec-
