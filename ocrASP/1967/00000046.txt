leery iii teary

Several of the local authorities in-
cluding the District Attorney M. Andrew
Dwyer spent a lot of time worrying
about the effect Dr.,Timothy Leary
would have on “young. impressionable”
college students. The event has come

and gone without incident.

Everyone in the audience listened to
both sides of the question, clapped. or
laughed in the right places. _We doubt
also that too many students are going
out to try LSD on the basis of what

Leary said.

If the authorities had been afraid
that the mere suggestion wouldbe enough
to persuade students then the publicity
of the objections would be even more
persuasive. Those that heard the threats
and publicity but didn’t hear the pre-
sentations are more likely to want to

try LSD.

Debate Footnote

To the Editors:

Last Wednesday evening a debate
was held on the resolution: “That
this House should condemn present
American policy in Vietnam.” After
suffering through the presentation
of the negative team's arguments,
i feel that several comments are in
order.,

As a debate, the program failed
because there was no direct clash
on the issues. The afflrmativeteam,
consisting oi John Carmichael,Jer-
ry Gaes, and Marc eringoff, chose
to offer a three-count indictment of
present American policy.

Briefly, they argued that (1) the
National Liberation Front (the Viet
Cong), and not communist-con-
trolled or North Vietnamese-con-
trolled; (2) the domino theory is
invalid; and (3) the United States,
rather than North Vietnam, was the
initial aggressor.

i agree with these three argu-
ments and believe that there are
several other counts on which U.S.
policy can be condemned. However,
whatever the meriots ofthe affirma-
tive arguments, they were neatly
dismissed by all three negative de-
baters because l‘they are irrelevant
to a debate on present policy."

The negative team, composed of
Richard Taylor, Lewis Fischer, and
Stratton Rawson, centered their de-
fense of American policy on the con-
tention that the “present policy is
negotiation."

The basic problem with the nega-
tive team's argument was that it
disregarded the tragic fact that
present American policy also in-
cludes the continued bombing of

North and South Vietnam, the con-
tinued destruction of civilian vii.
iages, and, most importantly, the
continued killing and manning of
the Vietnamese people.

It is true, as the negative team
contended, that the U, S, currently
appears to be seeking negotiations.
Conceding that the U. 15. now seeks
negotiations to end its military in.
voivement in Vietnam, It must be
remembered that this military com-

mitment was founded (or at least
justified by) certain assumptions;
the three points discussed by the
affirmative team were among those
assumptions. If these basic assump-
tions were incorrect, and the U.S.
has no right to beinvolved in the
internal affairs of Vietnam, is it
not only logical to expect that the
terms of negotiation should be rad—
ically different?

Since the present policy is the
outgrowth of a military involve-
ment which was predicated on cer-
tain past assumptions, I submit
that it was bsut‘d for the negative
team to contend that the affirmative
team's three-count indictment was
irrelevant.

The problem with the negative
team’s position reflects one of the
basic deficiencies in the arguments
of many defenders of American
policy: they have allowed themselves
to sidestep the crucial questions
relevant to American involvement
in Vietnam. These people are only
concerned that the U.S. is thch
and, for a variety of reasons, they
argue that the U.S. must remain.

If a person is going to offer a ra-
tional endorsement ofAmerican pol-
icy, he must be willing (and able) to
discuss certain issues.

Along with the issues raised by
the affirmative theam, there are
serious questions which must be
asked about U.S. military aid to
the French colonialists, about the
U, S. role in setting up and sup-
porting the Diem regime, about the
U.S. role in preventing the 1956
Vietnamese national election which
was stipulated in the Geneva agree-
ments, about the formation of the
NLF, about the role oi American
advisers in Vietnam in the early
1000's, about the overthrow of Diem
and the U. s. role in setting up and
supporting the government of Gen-
eral Ky, and finally, there are sor-
ious questions about the self-right.-
eoua, almost messianic, character
of America's anti-communist for.
eign policy.

On this campus, we are not really

 

confronting the basic issues in the
controversy over Vietnam simply
because not enough people lune been
asking the right questions.

While several thousand people
are killed or injured every week,
possibly we should be begin im-
mediately.

Telegrams Again

To the Editor:

As a followup to my letter of
April 4 “No Telegrams," i would
like to present the following infor-
mation relevant to the situation.
Upon my return from classes the
day that my letter was published,
I was greeted by a note which asked
me to call a Mr. Wyld at the tele-
phone company.

When 1 spoke to Mr. \Vyld, he told
me that he was contacted by Mr.
liob Stccrcr of the business office
at school and told about the situa-
tion. Mr. Wyld asked me to tell him
the entire story oi my telegram in-
cident and told me that the Univer-
sity pays its bills to the phone com-
pany and the telegram company in-
cident was not the University's or
the telephone company's mistake.

Mr. Wyld is presently trying to
locate the source of trouble and will
be getting back to me as soon as
finds out what it is.

Congratulations to the Business
Office, and especially toMr.Steerer
who initiated this inquiry. l apologize
to the Business Office for suggesting
that they didn’t pay their bills on
time.

i hope that in the near future 1
shall be able to announce to the
University community that telegram
charges will be allowed on our
phones.

The most important part of this
incident is the immediate interest
which was shown by the adminis-
tration. i think that once again the
administration has shown its power
in helping students.

liter. The Counter'lnielligence

 

by Martin Schwartz

“There are three kinds of lies:
Lies, Damned lies, and Statistics.”
Benjamin Disraeli

At the amigo! this week, we all
will have thegzopp‘opmnity to vote
inwhat is taught gly referedto as

 

 
 
 

 

The present referendum suffers
from the a semantic problem. What
IS the prose US policy in the war?
is it escalation, negotiation, or a
combination of the two?

The major problem is that the

referendum tries to include two sys-
tems of thought into one frame of
reference. While the a and c choices
in the ballot (see bottom of page one)
talk of the US military commitment,
the b choice refers to the "POLICY"
behind the commitment. There is
no possible response for the per-
son who, in general, does not sup-
port the present US policy in the
war.
- Another vehement objection. that
I have to the referendum is that
choice c does not differentiate be-
tween "doves" and “owls.” An owl
is one who basically is opposed to
the war but whois definitely opposed
to immediate withdrawal of troops.
He, instead, is in favor of negotia-
tion.

The owl stand may be radically
different from the pacifist or dove
who _demands an immediate end to
the war, yet, on this ballot,he would
show up the salne.

Again, it may not .even be pos-
sible to test for opinions on the
military commitment and present
US policy in the same ballot. One
may support negotiation (c) while
at the same time either supporting
or rejecting present Us policy.

The attitude that one takes into
peace talks can make an important
difference in the outcome of such
talks. This referendum does not
allow this difference to show.

Perhaps there should be two ques—
tions on the referendum; one dealing
with support for the military com-
mitment and another with the sup-
port for present US policy. if so,
there should be some way to dif—
ferentiate between those for negotia—
tion and those for withdrawal.

One thing IS certain. For their
six weeks of work Central Council
and the Political and Social Affairs
Committee have managed to come
up with a referendum ballot which
is next to worthless, if not com—
pletely worthless for testing student
opinion.

Possibly the only way to save this
referendum is for any of us with
more specific attitudes than those
tested to ‘write on the ballot their
Views, i.e. withdrawal, negotiation,
etc.

We can only hope that next time
an issue such as this comes up,
Central Council will find out what
the hell they are doing instead of
bumbling along as usual.

 

Building Better Bridge

by Rich Bet: and Marty Bergen

The decision of whether or not to
sacrifice is a bid which you do not
expect to make, but you believe that
you will lose fewer points in your
contract than your opponents would

have gained for making their con-,

tract. Sacrifice bidding is especially
important in duplicate bridge, when
it can be better to go down as many
as eleven tricks, if your opponents
can make a grand slam with favor-
able vulnerability.

Today’s hand features good bid-
ding by both sides, climaxed by
West’s good decision to take a
sacrifice.

Accident: Affairs
Wllll Convocation

At its weekly meeting held last
Tuesday, MYSKANIA met with Dick
Jankowski, head of Camp Board. Af-
ter a short discussion, it was de-
cided that MYSKANIA can best help
the group by aiding in publicity

Qnatters and attempting to interest
new members in joining.

Anyone who wishes to work on
Camp Board is urged to contact
Jankowskl as soon as possible. New
people are especially needed in the
latter months of this school year.

MYSKANIA also made plans to
organize a day at the Mohawk, most
likely on April 16. Details will be
announced in Friday's paper.

The group also decided to act in
conjunction with the Commission on
Academic Affairs in sponsoring an
Honors Convocation, presently
listed on the University calendar

‘ r April 23. Sue Budd was named
0 head MYSKANIA'S committee for
the Convocation.

A discussion was also held to for-
mulate a policy statement regarding
the vacant seat presently existing
on MYSKANIA. A statement will be
released in the near future.

Chairman Ray McCloat was dele-
gated to attend a meeting of the Fes-
tival of Religion in the Arts, which
has asked MYSKANIA to take an
active role in the formation of such
a festival.

As a last order of business, it
was decided upon that the Class

[liuardians for next year's freshman
class would be chosen at this week's
meeting.

Happening To Feature
Action, Excitement
In Several Areas

There will be a meeting tonight
for anyone interested in working with
“Landings,” a happening which is
scheduled for May 10, at 0:00 p.m.
in the Assembly Room.

Student work on “Leniiings,” in—
‘fluding a scavenger hunt, has al—
ready begun under the direction of
Dr. Thomas thtlefield of the Uni-
versity’s English Department.

The title “Landings” is taken
from a quote in Shakespeare’s "King
Lear" which protests the “lend—
lngs” the environment thrusts upon
human experience.

Littlefield explained the idea of
n happening as working with the
notion that experience occurs
through interactions of people and
their environment, and what people
do within this environment. In a

opening an environment is created
which can itself be used as asource
of action.

The environment of “Landings”
will center around the 'lendings’
thrust upon the student by the Uni-
versity, and will contain several
areas of unrelated action.

Littlofield explained that the use
of several areas of action whichnre
related only through “random spon-
taneity" comes from the P. T. Bar-
num Method of staging it happening
where excitement is maintained by
the several centers of action.

HLandings" will differ from many
Isitter types of happenings in that it

ill involVe student action rather
than being a spectator sport; some
happenings operate under the phil-
osophy that the actors, in acting
their parts, become that part,
whereas in "Landings" the actors,
acting under a series of directions,
will become themseivos.
