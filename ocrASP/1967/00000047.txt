of this program contact Spud Kruzan,
our varsity trainer, in Draper Oil

Forlleeliemi Progra-

Tomorrow night the International
Film Group will present an alt-
comedy program--“Duck Soup"end
“The Cage of the Mukkinese Battle
Horn."

"Duck Soup" stars the Marx
Brothers and is in its OWn way one
of the most subversive comedies to
come out of Hollywood. Its satiric
target is nothing less than interne-
tlonal diplomacy, patriotism, em
war.

its techniques range from step-
stick to verbal barrages and subtle
parody. The gifted pantomime of
Harpo, the incredible punnlng of
Chloe, and Groucho’s inexhaustible
genius for the devastating, put-
down wisecrack--all are given full
rein in a film which is eatse Sltlllilltﬂ
subject with an almost surrealistic
inanlty..

Spike Milllgan and Terry-Thomas
also star in this totally insance story
of the theft of a valuable Mukkinese
battle-horn from the British Mu-
seum; Sellers portrays a Scotland
Yard Inspector called in to inves-
tigate. The characteristic English
humor of "The Case of the Mukki-
nese Battle Horn" had a large in-
fluence on such recent directors
as Richard Lester and Bryan
Forbes.

The two films will be shown Sat-
urday at 7:00 and 9:15 in Draper
349. Admission is 35¢ with student
tax, 50¢ without.

Also at this program, tickets for
the April 29 show of "Psycho"
will be available. Tickets will go
on sale March 25, location to be
announced. "Psyche" will be the
last paid lFG show of the semes-
ter, the three programs in May

all being free of charge.

thus marred by the ability of this

The need for dissent.
the lack of communication
and an erosion of confi-
dence in our nation were a
few of the topics discussed
by Carey McWilliams,edi-
tor of “The Nation.”

McWilliams, speakingln the Cani-
pus Center Ballroom Tuesday eve-
ning, lectured on the need for dis-
eent within our society, citing this
as a challenging problem within this
country.

Due to the distortion ofdissenslon
McWilliams exemplified one area of
foreiin policy where conformity is
present. He cited the “absence of
policy toward China and Vietnam."
We have created a policy which
has advocated an encouratement of
instilling fear in the Chinese people
against our geverninent, McWilliam
stated.

ln concluding McWilltains
'tressed that “we must have all
Pressures for Conformity

McWilliams stressed three areas
that are presently pressure centers
for conformity. He mentioned first
the last twenty years of external
peril that has caused a rigidpattern
of thought and a built—in limitations

to the freedom of dissent.
Congress, accordlnv tm McWil-
llnms, has made dissent difficult
through its use of anti-subversive

comiiilttees.

A new fraternity on the univer-
sity campus will gain official status
tomorrow, when the Zeta Psi chap-
ter is inducted into the international
Organlm'ion Rwo'u'ion i.iteiiiity of Delta Sigma Pi.

A second pressure area for con-
formity has been the organization
revolution occurring within our so-
ciety. With large organizationspre-
sent the aspirations of individuals
to climb the "greasy" status lad-
der obligates these people to satisfy
those above them. The end result of
this process has been the inclina-
tion of these people to suppress
their true opinion.

The largest professional business
administration fraternity, Delta Sig-
nia Pl numbers some 145 chapters
in the U.S., Canada and Mexico and
has more than 58,000 alumni, many
of them prominent business and
education loaders. Students major-
ing in business or economics are
eligible for membership.

Student and Faculty Organlzers

interested students and faculty at
Albany hogan organizing a business
fraternity early last year for the
purpose of promoting profession-
allty among its members whointeiid
to pursue careers in the business
world. Guest speakers, tours, for-
ums and business organizations are
intricate parts of such a fraternity,
in addition to the usual social as-
pects.

Science and lechnology

During the last three decades,
according to McWilllains, a sciati-
tific and technological explosion has
resulted in a form of parnoin of
change by the older generation. its
stated this was another important
step leading to a conformity ofopln-
ion.

An additional pressure for con-
formity has been in the area of
mass media, especially In news
coverage. The editor of “The Na-
tion" revealed that 60% of the adult
population rely primarily upontele-
vision for their news.

The local group temporarily as-
sumed the name of Alpha Sigma Up-
silon, but decided its goal could
best be achieved by affiliation with
a national organisation. Delta Big-
me Pi was chosen because it offered

thin.” The failure to do this is
creating a feeling of powerlessness
among our people.
