Telegrams, Pauling Topics
Dismissed At eminence

Telegrams that are charged to
phone bills was one oi the items
discussed at- the President’s Con-
ference Monday. President Conins
asserted that telephone.bills are
not in the same category as the un-
paid medical bills. mentioned
earlier.

Within two weeks 95% of the stu-
dents pay their phone bills to the
business office which in turn pays
the telephone company. if the stu-
dent does not pay the business of-
fice within 30 days then the busi-
ness office pays the phone com-
pany and later gets the money from
the students.

Concerning the fact that one stu-
dent could not have a telegram
charged to his phone, President
Collins stated that this was a reg-
ional policy of Western Union and
not a result of students' unpaid

.tern,‘ Union had formed this ollc .'

but Collins indicated that he op

their general policy would change.

Regarding the question of whether
or not a letter should be written to
parents about the women's hours
proposal, President Collins said he
thought the oniatter should be left to
Living Area Afiairs Commission. A
representative of LAAC said he per-
sonally thought the matter should
be left to the administration.

No matter who writes the letter,
the policy will not be held up until

.responses to the letter are received.
Also at the Conference was a-

lengthy discussion of the parking
regulations and any new matters
that may come up during the year.
President Collins said that there
is a committee working now on
parking issues that have recently
come up.

Ph.D. in physiology and apology from
the University of California, Berke-
lay, in l927, after having spent
1918-1919 in France with the ex,-
peditionary forces. He taught at the

University of Oregon from 1927 to

1926, and at Harvard Medical School
1928-1930.
Taught at Berkeley ,

. He returned to Berkley in 1930,
teaching there in the Department of
Physiology until 1938. Professor
Blum's work with the National Can-
cer institute began in 1938.

He was principal biophysist with
the Naval Medical Research insti-
tute in 1943-1946, returning to the
National Cancer Institute in 1947.
in 1936, 1946, and 1953 he held
Guggenheim Fellowships and ‘in
1957-58, a U. '8. Public Health
Special Research Fellowship.

 

  

The volume, a standard work in the
field, was reprinted in 1964 with
only minor revisions.

Another of Blum's Interests

Another of Professor Blum’s in-
terests has been in mechanisms of
evolution. In 1951 he published
"Time’s Arm and Evolution,” re-
portedly one o the most inﬂuential
books in the field.
' in 1959 in “Carcinogenesis by
Ultraviolet Light," Professor Blum
tied together a large body of results
of experiments by himself and
others. He is universally regarded
‘as an authority in the field.

in recent years Professor Blum's
interest in organic evolution has
led him into serious consideration
of factors in the evolution of human

Professor Blum hashadgcareer‘ culture. Some of his most recent

long interest in the effect of light
on molecules, cells and organisms,
which led to the publication in 1941
of a book “Photodynamlc Action

publications deal with that subject.

Professor Blum will join the de-
partment of biological sciences in
September.

Under the guidance of
Mrs. Barbara Rotundo of
the E n gli sh Department,
the English Evening Com-
mittee, after sessions of
brainstorming decided to
present for its Spring pro-
duction an Evening with
Shakespeare.

This theme is not as dull as it
may seem. instead, it met with an
erlhusiastlc respone not only with
students but with the English fac-
ulty.
After the committee agreed upon
the theme they began to look around
for someone to produce English
Evening. As a result the committee
chose three producers: James Lob-
dell, Paul Downes, and Kathleen
Sturtevant.

Nights Dream" directed by Alex
Krakower. Robert Donovan and his

The Yale University Band Concert on Sunday.

April 9. began with an atrocious display of filing in, on
the part of the band members. Thereupon. followed a‘
divided concert —'- the first part lying the realm of
mediocrity, and the second'part (after the intermis— .
slon) displaying a superbness rarely found in college

bands. ,

At 4:08. "Keith Wilson
took the conductor’s stand
with a lack of assurance
as to what the outcome of
the concert would be. per-'
haps because of the stage
limitations and lack of or-
chestral room.

Unfortunately the "Royal Fire-
works Music" by Handel proved to
be a poor opener for it lacked the
majestic flowing qualities so typi-
cal of Handel. The movement, Alla
Sicilians, was too harsh and the
Menuetto, too staccato.

The excellent playing byMr. Bor-
ror in the Eccles number which
followed showed lack of coordina-
tion between band and trombone.
The clarinet section reeked with
squeaks and intermittent laughter
by two members.

As for “The Symphony tor Band"
by Persichettl, one could only wish
that Mr. Wilson wmud have dis-
played cleaner attacks, especially
in the woodwind instruments. Also.
the constant clocking of cufflinks and
the persistent talking and shuffling
in the band did not lend itself to
the diatonic melodic structure por-

there is still an interestlntheworldi lrayed in Persichetti.

of Shakespeare.

When the format has been defi-
nitely decided upon, the participants
in this year’s English Evening pro-
duction can look forward to rehear-
sals which will culminate May 4,
when the English Evening Committee

presents an evening with Shakesm

pea're.
