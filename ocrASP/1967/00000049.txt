OREAT MUSICAL IINFOLOS-
PAINTON F ROSTED GLASS

The first thing considered when writing aboutaplay
more-often than not, is its plot and characterization
and such seems to be the case with “Carnival.” But.
especially with a musical comedy, this may notbe the

most important aspect of

production. In following

“Carnival” from its conception last year to its open-
ing night climax, the many other crucial factors be—

come evident.

The first real evidence
of a production on its way
were the posters which

have appeared all over the

campus in the last weeks.

The diiierent shades of yellow,
blue and green produce a startling
visual eiiect which is easily identi-
fiable with the show. The long nar-
row design contrasts with the usual
poster size and shape, and the
placing oi the lettering accents the
length of the poster.

With this part 0! the publicity
well in hand, attention shifted to
other typically “Carnival” ideas
such as the use oi “Come See
‘Carnival’ " buttons and the recent
addition at balloons in typical “Car-
nival” colors.

Coming into the rehearsal area
even beiore you can see what is
going on, you know that this is"that
Musical" advertised lor April 21,
22.

The songs, perhaps with the ex-
ception of "Love Makes the World
Go 'Round," are not what you would
call memorable, but they are de-
lightful and entertaining and iii
tightly into the plot. This makes them
very diiiicult to periorm.

During the first weeks oi produc-
tion, numbers are rehearsed in
small groups at! stage with many
hours spent in getting everything
down, especially the mood to be ex-
pressed, just right. Then the selec-
tions are staged  and everything
seems to [all apart.

But eventually, with additional
long hours 0! work, coaching, start-
ing and stopping, dwelling on de-
tails - hectic days oi coordination
by the director and assistant direc-
tor, last minute changes which be-
come obviously necessary when re-
hearsals move to the stage - the
show begins to take shape.

sight is noiaseuyasltlooks,”

it is the in hours at work sped in

coed in giving it the W

When the publicity has completed
its task, the music, choreography,
costumes, and sets integrated, the
props added, and the audience com-
fortably seated, the stage will come
alive with what has been called by
critics “a perfect musical,” “a
painting on a frosted glass, done by
a hand that cares."

OF ILLUSION, REALITY

“Carnival” is all that makes the theatre live and
breathe and Lili is its spokesman. It is an imginary
world of illusion and make-believe hauntingly juxta-
posed with reality. It is between these two forces —
illusion as personified by Marco-the-Magnificent
and reality as presented by Paul, the Puppeteer,
that Lili is torn.

Lili lives in a cardboard world. Having left the
security of the town of her childhood. she seeks to
recapture the security in the tinsel and magic world
of the carnival. This world is seen by Lili as like the
beautiful. sensitive, polyanna scene of her home town
where they had the “greenest trees” and hills as
bright as “flame.”

World of the Carnival
But the world of the carnival is very different from
the childish concept which Lili has and when she
meets Paul, she is faced with reality. She sees that

_ Marco, whose ability to grasp a carnation out of the

air has attracted her, is a fraud.

“Carnival” is not a ‘play representing a harsh
reality triumph over the world of illusion. however.
The message of the play is this: There is atime
and a place four make-believe. Lili, at the end of
the play. comes to a self-realization; dreams are
not bad to have. but all dreams must come to an end.

Lili learns to say, “This is over, now ontothe
next thing.” She learns to accept reality, not reluc-
tantly but with a realization that she has passed from
a little girl’s dream—world into a mature, real world.

The Realization
This realization does not fully take place until the
end of the play when she is holding the limp puppet in
her hand and Paul’s words are ringing in her ears.

In any play there is a tendency to overplay the sub-
ordinate elements to the point that the core. the heart
of the story. becomes lost in externals. ln“Carnlval”
this danger is especially great. The other elements of
the play. Marco and Rosalie in particular, can easily
dominate the show if allowed to.

But the relationship between Lili and Paul. the
conflict between illusion and reality, is the soul of
the play and this element correctly presented,emphs~
sized and arranged in such a way that the subordinated
elements take on their proper proportion makes the
play a powerful piece of dramatic art.
