‘ varsity’s intercollegiate program which has expanded

. rapidly and which has become such an important'pa‘rt

iii-athletics on this campus, that we feel we should
devote at least one column to it. And this may come
as a surprise to everyone--women's intercollegiate

athletics. .
‘ The expansion in

woinen's- sports is reflected by

a comparison of this year’s and the proposed next
year’s budgets. Approximately $3.000, Or one. twen-
tieth of the entire intercollegiate athletic budget was
devoted to women's intercollegiate athletics for the
1966-67 season. The proposed expenditure for the
1967-68 year calls for over $12,000. one eighth of
the intercollegiate athletic program.

Reasons for the increase are many. Primarily. for
the first time'our women's teams will be provided with
appropriate uniforms for each sport. Women partici-

pants will be allowed to

attend the end-of—the-year

banquet, and a system of awards will be given to
those who merit them. The awards would involve items
especially appropriate for women: for example, brace-

let charms or sports pins.

Secondly, there will be an increase in the number of

scheduled contests. For

outdoor sports, there is a

6 to 8 game schedule and 10 to 12 games for approved
indoor sports. In the last few years, women have
participated in only four or five contests for each of
their four activities, field hockey, basketball. softball
and tennis. Thirdly. competitive swimming will be
initiated in the winter of 1967-68.

With the increased facilities of this University.wo-
men team members will be able to practice regularly
and vigorously. increase their skills, and earn the
right to participate as representatives of their Uni-

‘ versity. We also feel that they should play under con-

ditions that reﬂect the University’s appreciation of

their talent and effort.

The women’s physical

education staff at SUNY.‘

Albany, has spent considerable time discussing what
we believe to be desirable conditions for women's
intercollegiates on this campus. We- appreciate the
work that these women have done and support the
women’s sports program wholeheartedly. We feel
that continued and expanding support will permit the
kind of program that the entire University community
and particularly the women students, can view with

pride.

It is our hope that the program for the highly skilled
women can continue to improve. both in the quality of
experiences offered and in the number of women stu-

dents involved.

Spud said college lenders who
have shown academic ability or
distinguished themselves ill extru-
curriculur leadership have been ill-
vitod to the one day event. invita-
tions have already been issued to
the leaders on this campus accord-
ing to Longshoi'o.

“This is a talent search and an
effort to encourage New York State
college students to play a part in
shaping the course and direction of
our state and national life by anter-
liig u field related to public affairs
and by assuming an active role in
the partisan process," Mr. Spao
said.

Tile program is part of a nation-
wide ialent search initiated by lie-
publican National Committee Chair-
man hay Bliss in conjunction with

State Committees and College Young ,

Republican Clubs.

Thomas explained that the great
turning pollii in his life was the
ndvelii of World Will” i. Before the
war this country was in a state of
“singular stability" and the people
were very optimistic about the fu-
lure. Lint the war changed this out-
look.

Tile economics of this country
have changed considerably over the
past fifty years, accordingioThom-
as. One used to speak of socialism
versus free enterprise. We don’t
have "so lliucli free enierprise as
you think." We need certain controls
on business.

Thomas tlien wenl on to make ills
plea against war. “Man is the most
aggressive and cruel of animals,”
but that “does not mean we have to
go to war... We are not damned by
God or genes.

We fought two World Wars and
“failed to solve the problem of
War.” With the money that the
modern world spends on war we
could “control pollution, pro
could “control pollution, poverty,
population, and disease."

Concerning Victnnlll, 'l‘liolllns sold
“our fears are groundless." There
is no hood [or us in be there. We
iii‘t‘ simply "destroying a nation’s
mind, body, and soul." if we say
that we are fighting for democracy
than we are practicing "liypocl'acy
in the cxu'cme“ because iiinl coun-
try doesn't know wind it is.

’l‘llolnus’ solution called for an
end to the bombing, a promise to
cause fire unless fired upon, and a
recolivoiiing of the Geneva Califor-
encc of. nations. He then called for
universal disarmament with policing
and ii considerable strengthening of
the United Nations as the "alterna-
tive war" that is necessary in to-
day's society.

A question and answer period
followed the lecture. When asked
to comment on the Domino Theory
Ml'. Thermos said he thought it was
a very poor theory that so far has
not been working at all in Southeast

sia.

Thomas felt that the protest move-
ment in this country was not a gen.
erai protest against war but was
against a particular war. However,
he suggested that those who wish
to protest should press their Con-
gressmen and should support the
anti-draft movement.

New Widget Increased

Tax Fee To

Be Same

Central Council, last Thugsday night, approved a

total budget of $148,179.00

for the 1967-1968 fiscal

year. The CounCll also decided to retain the present

fee for Student Association

membership at $28.50 for

full time students. Deborah Friedman, chairman of
the Central Council Budget Committee, explained

that the budget was
because an unwieldy sur—
plus of funds had to be
reduced. The surplus came
about because more stu-
dents than was anticipated
paid their student tax last

year.

This has been the first time that
Central Council has approved each
budget individually silice its estab-
lishment two years ago. in the past
the Council approved the budgets of
each commission together in one
lump.

The method followed this year ell-‘-
abled the members of the council to
scrutinize each individual budget
and to argue over any one budget
without jeopardizing all the budgets
in a commission. After the review
of the budgets Thursday Central
Coulicil odded\$4,000.00 to the total
budget proposed by the Central
Council Budget committee.

The members of Central Council
decided to add to the budget a four
hundred dollar salary for the Stu-
dent Association President next
year over the protests of President
William Cleveland. Cleveland, ajun-
for, stated, "I myself don’t wantcre
(a provision for a salarv." '

The election of Carol liosentlial
to MYSKANlA for the coming year
was declared null and void by the
Standing Comlniitee on Student Tax
of the Student Association.The main
reason for this declaration is that
the Student Tax Policy dictates that
membership in the Student Asso-
ciation is necessary for participa-
tion in any group financed in whole
or in part by Student Association.
