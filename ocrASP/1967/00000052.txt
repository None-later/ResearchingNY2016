Henry Madej is chairman of Political

met several times to write the referen-

with ours so we are presenting his auth—
ority instead of quoting him on the actual
cause and effect of the referendum.

confirmed by the fact that a majority of

and with the inevitable controversy over
the wording of the statements. Though
many complaints are no doubt the result
of honest inability to identify with one of
them, a larger number are more the
product of less meaningful ex post facto

criticisms.

The Referendum was held as a direct
result of the refusal of our delegates to
the Vietnam conference at Cornell to
vote for a strong denunciation of the war
as unreflective of our student body and
the desire of Central Council to confirm

or disprove this.

The statements, no doubt imperfect
in "totem, were the result of the com~
bined efforts of the P.S.R. committee
and Central Council to write statements
reflective of the major schools of thought
on the war and yet simple enough to be
readily understood and easily publicized.

opinion has'been ignored or “excluded”
the blame for this must lie at least
equally with that group. Notices, indeed

Critical Criticism

To the Editors:

Much criticism has been leveled
at Dr. Martin Luther King and other
leaders of the American Civil rights
movement for his criticism of
American military involvement ill
Vietnam because it is felt that an
espousement of an unpopular and
controversial opinion lnight detract
from his primary concern,the real-
ization of full social, economic, and
political maturity of the American
Negro.

However, the question comes to
mind, what is Dr. King to do to ex-
press a supposedly deeply felt'con-
victlon on possibly the mostsignlti-
cant issue confronting the American
people today. is Dr. King to suppress
his personal convictions of the war
because some white "liberals,"
“Uncle Tom's," or the establish-

! Ut mlgllt be offended or allen~
ated?

Well. Mr. Jones, if you were in
Dr. King's shoes (don't worry,
you're not) would you communicate
your ideas solely with God and let

the rest of the world go by or
would you rather (and here's the
rub) publicly and irrevocably com-
mit yourself?

This involves another more funda-
mental questionofthe moral charac-
ter of Americans. Can we accept
opinions from any quarter andjudge
them on their individual merits or
do we judge ideas by the sole cri-
terion of who sponsors what?

Wheeling Deals

To the Editors:

it came as a surprise to find out
that bicycles being made available
to students in the bookstore will
not, as i had assumed, be loaned
simply on a tax card basis as a
service of the Student Association
but rattler are beillg rented to the
students by the bookstore itself.

This raises the questions of:

1. Why the old policy of tax card
loaning of bicycles was abolished.

2. Why the bookstore has as-
sumed contlol of a service (which
under the present setup is no long.
or a service) which was previously
Student Aasooiation domain.

 

 

With the student activities fee
remaining the same, why should the
Faculty Student Association simul-
taneously reduce services available
to students and provide for itself
yet one more source of income?

To my‘knowledge no explanation
has been offered regarding this ac-
tion.

I have to assume then, that the

" by Martin Schwartz

On the front page of today's paper
you can find the results of the re-
cent referendum on Viet Nam. Sev-
eral interesting interpretations are
possible, but not enough. ,

The most important fact is that
almost 25% of the student body voted
in this referendum. This is really
impressive when one considers that
only 16% voted in the recent class
and MYSKANIA elections. Rarely
does an election in this school ever
reach such lofty heights as around
the 15% mark.

A little quick, possibly faulty,
arithmetic reveals the following fig-
ures: 28.3% voted to increase mili-
tary commitment; 24.6% supported
present policy; 43.5% wanted a de-
crease in military commitment;
2.5% had no opinion; and 1.1%volded
their ballots by voting for two opin-
ions, voting row F, etc.

One way of interpretation is to
see how many people support the
present U. S. commitment. If we
group together all those who sup-
port present pollcy and those who
support our position but want an
increase —in commitment, we get
62.9% of those voting.

The above figure is opposed to
43.5% of those Voting who supported
a decrease in commitment. Using
this interpretation, a majority of
the student body can be said to sup-
port the war in general.

Looking at the figures as they
stand, however, we can see that
the greatest number of students
favor position C. Unfortunately,
there is no way of knowing how
many of these are in favor of with-
drawal as opposed to negotiation.

Poaslbly the most amazing thing
about this referendum is the sur-
prisingly low number of people that
supported present policy. 71.8% of
those voting were in favor of some
change in present policy, whether
for escalation or for die-escalation.

Another surprising result is 97.5%
had an opinion of some sort to ex-
press, a phenomenon unknown to
Gallup and Harris. What is more
likely is that the over 75% of the
student body who didn't vote were
the ones with no opinion.

When the figures are broken up
into voting areas, another inter-
esting fact shows up. The ratio of
those who voted for positions A and
B against position C was Dutch Quad
9'? to 58; Colonial Quad 134 to 114;
Alumni Quad 290 to 200. However
in the Campus Center the ratio was
111 to 147.

What is interested is the inter-
pretation of this finding. Perhaps
the majority of peace dissenters
live off campus. Does living on
cémpus promote pro-establishmen-
tism? Are those for die-escalation
bearded stereotypes who live in
apartments?

Perhaps it is something simpler
like both those who dissent and
those who live in apartments are
older. What is more probable is
that the more intelligent people
are too smart to eat in the dorms
and were over the Campus Center
voting instead.

Seriously, some lnterestingthings
came out of the referendum, but I
don’t think that anything of any value
can be said about student opinion
here until something a little better
is undertaken.

 

Building Better Bridge l

by Rich Bet: and Marty Bergen

Because the minor suits, clubs
and diamonds are only worth twenty
points apiece for each trick, the
duplicate bridge player hates to
play ill a contract of five diamonds
or five clubs, if there is any chance
at all of making three no trump.
For example, biddingthree notrump
and making four is worth more than
bidding five clubs and making six.
Also, there' are many hands which
can take nine tricks, but don’t stand
a prayer of taking eleven. There-
fore, bidding auctions may arise
which look very strange, but in fact
the players are usually exploring
for a three no trump contract. In
today's hand, North-South bids to a
very fine three no trump contract,
despite having only seven cards
between them in the major suits.

South opened the bidding with one
,diamond, and West overcalled with
one spade. North had a very power-
ful hand in support of diamonds,
and made the bid of two clubs. East
showed his spade support and South
his club support and West passed.
North now made the key bid oftllree
spades. He knew his side has “mil-
lions” of diamonds and clubs, but
felt that three no trump might score
better if partner had "staff" ill the
major suits. His bid of three spades
showed a partial stopper in spades,
and asked his partner to bid tllree no
trump if he had apartial spade stop-
per also. South certainly did have a
partial stopper ill spades and bid
three no trump in a flash. Everyone
passed and West led the five of
spades.
South took ills twelve tricks for
a top score, since everyone else
was in five diamonds or clubs,
making fch or six. Notice that even
if West leads lils two aces, which
is very unlikely, South will still
make eleven tricks for a top score.
When you are playing duplicate
bridge, make every attempt to ex—
plore for a three no trump contract
in preference to a galneln the minor

Fifty From University

in New York

Actively present at last Saturday's
peace demonstration were 50 stu-
dents and faculty members from
the State University of New York
at Albany. The demonstration began
with a rally at Central Park where
pro and antl- war buttons were dis-
tributed; it ended at Dag Hammer-
skold Plaza after a long and slow
march. Among the speakers at the
United Nations were Dr. Martin
.iiher King, Stokcly Carmichael,
Floyd McKissick, and Dr. Benjamin
Spock.

Dy ll e.ln. Central Park was
filled with marchers, most of whom
were college students. Other col-
leges that were represented include
Columbia, llarvard, ltadcllff,
M.I.T., New York University, and
many of the State schools. There
were a large number of non—college
participants also, including a large
number of middle and old age dem—
’strators and sylnpathizers.

Once the march began it was
slowed by cross town traffic.Groups
of policemen stopped the march
to wave two or three cars through.
it was orderly and peaceful, some
groups sange while others chanted
"Peace Nowl"

The parade route was lined with
both pro and anti-war sympatllizers.
Some of the posters on display in-
clude: “Make Love not War,“ “Vic-
.ry then Peace," "Forced Dem-
ocracy is Hypocracy," and one sug-
gested that the college students go
home and smoke their pot.

The American Film Academy will

“To Die in Madrid” recounts the

several foreign nations were drawn
into the strife.

“To Die in Madrid" documents
this perplexing conflict as lucldly

ails Biological Field station at the

‘ State University College at Oswego

will offer a side variety of oppor-
tunities for field studies during its
first summer session, July 3 to
August 10. r

The new field laboratory was
completed in late 1966 and is pre-
sently being supplied with the most
modern teaching and .research
equipment. '

"One of the primary purposes of
the field laboratory is to enable the
student to study organisms in their
natural environment which supple-
.Inents the usual textbook treatment
of organisms," Dr. George Max-
well, director ofthe Biological Field
Station, explained.

Concern Over Environment

The broad environmental ap-
proach to the study of biology has
taken on new meaning with man’s
"concern over misuse of his en-
vironment.

“Thus field courses and inde-
pendent studies offer exciting op-
portunities for those interested in
gaining a good background in un-
dergraduate biology and for high
school teachers of biology to gain
graduate credit toward a Master’s
degree in biological education.”

The program consists of a choice
of four courses and independent
study with a full load comprising
two courses, each with three hours
credit, or one course and three
hours of independent study.

Courses offered include Biolog-
ical Conservation, Ornithology,

tField Botany, and Animal Ecology.

As much work as is possible will
be completed in the field. Full days
will be devoted to the courses of-
fered providing sufficient time to
develop an understanding of the
concepts studied.

Location of Field Station
The field station is located two
miles southwest of the main cam—
pus off Thompson Road in the Town
of Oswego. It consists of 125 acres
of woodlands, including a 26:a_cre

  
   
    

_ pond newly created to provide op-
portunities for aquatic-study.

The new one-story laboratory
building contains I lecture-labor-
atory, a research room and a seal-
mar-lecture room which overlooks
Rice Pond. '1

A brochure depicting the' field
station facilities and listing infor-
mation on costs, housing and reg-
istration is available from Dr. 0.

lege at Oswego, or from the col-

The Campus Center Gallery at
the University will be the scene of
a one-man exhibition of photographs
by Joe Alper beginning tomorrow.

The exhibition is built around
the theme of "Water." it includes
such diverse subject matter as a
tricycle abandoned in the rain and?
study of dishes soakingin the kitchen
sink. Nature and figure studies make
up a major part of the exhibit.

Mr. Alper's work is well-known
in the Albany area, through various,
one-man shows and through his free
lance work for the Albany, Troy,.
and Schenectady newspapers. His
photographs have been published in
the “New York Times" and the
“Herald Tribune.”

One of the artist's specialties
is photographing the personages and
environment of the jazz and folk
music worlds. He has made record
cover photographs for various musi-
cians as well as covers for the
magazines, “Down Beat” and
"Jazz."

Skldmore College recently spon-
sored an exhibition of photographs
of Victorian architecture by Mr.
Alper. The works in the show will
be incorporated in a book to be
published this summer by the New
