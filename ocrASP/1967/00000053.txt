a single loss to Utico College and a double loss to Oswego.

.  The Albany baseball nine ran into some tough pitching this week,'as they fell
to Utic‘a 2-1.0n Thursday and then dropped‘both ends of a double-header to Oswego

on. Saturday. In the Utica encounter, Albany’s Cas Galka‘ﬁ‘nd Utica’s John Smith
hooked up in quite a dual. After eight innings the score was 0-0 With a mere one
hit apiece. ,Galka had registered 11 strikeouts while Smith had 7 Ks. The stage

was set for a climactic
ninth. v '

The‘~ Great Danes broke ‘

the ice in their half when
Paul Leonetti was hit by
a pitch; he moved to sec-
ond on Jim Murley’s sac-
rifice, and scoredon Denny
Elkin’s single to right.‘
Utica was not to be denied, how-
ever, as they opened the bottom of
the ninth with back to back singles
off a tiring Galka. Rich Patrei re-
lieved Gaika, and walked the only
batter he faced, with the tying run

Iota Phi Sigma,

Beta Phi Sigma, who actually won
top position last week, is now offl-
cially League ll Champion in AMIA
bowling. Paced throughout the year
by the two top bowlers inthe league,
Steve Furdyn and Paul Smolynski,
they ended the season powerfully,
leaving their nearest rival, APA,
far behind.

The last week of bowling was a

scoring on a wild pitch.

Tom Piotrowski then relieved Pa-
trei, and his wal loaded the bases,
and brought up Brian Williams, 'who
lofted a sacrifice fly to center for
the winning run.

On Saturday the Great Danes tra-
veled to Oswego for a pair oi seven
inning ball games. Oswego drew
first blood in the opener when Al-
bany hurler Tom Egelston yielded
two doubles in the third.

Albany came back to tie in the
top of the fourth Jack Sinnctt led off
with a single, Elkin walked, George
Webb was hit by a pitch, and Gary

.Torino‘ walked forcing in the tying

run. Oswego went ahead to stay in
the fifth on a single and athree base
error, and they added their final
tally in the sixth on a triple and a
sacrifice fly.

Egleston Pitched Well
Egelston went the rout for Coach
Burlingame, yielding six hits and
two earned runs, while striking out
three._T_no Great Dane batsmen also
s

had six hits, but Oswego’s Rich
Furmak was tough in the clutch.

Albany jumped into a quick 2-0
lead in the second game as Leon-
etti led off with a single and Scored
on Elkln's booming triple. Elkin
then came across on Andy Chris-
tian’s single.

Oswego, however, came back for
four in the bottom of the inning.
Two walks and a hit batsman loaded
the bases, a sacrifice fly scored
one, another hit batsman filled the
bases, a single scored two morO
and fourth run came in on an error.

Webb and Piotrowski Good in Rellet

Two more runs came across in
the second on a walk, a single, a
walk, hit batsman and a fielders
choice. At this point Coach Bur-
lingame called on George "Spider"
Webb, who shut off the rally and
then pitched hitless bail for the
third and fourth. Tom Pioirowski
came on in the fifth and pitched
shutout ball the rest of the way,
but Oswego's Tozar was equally
tough as he yielded only one b“
after the first.
