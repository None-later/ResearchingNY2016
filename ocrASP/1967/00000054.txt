Thorns stated that he had received ,

H ‘3' several letters from theconmcm"

' I about students walking 'on seeded
areas.

The letters stated that informal
athletic activities were tearing up ,
the sod and lawn which had not yet
been turned over the University.
Thorne suggested that students
wishing to play ball in an open area
use the fields southeast of the gym.

Bicycles

Thorne was asked about the fact
that bicycles were being rented in-
stead of given to students who just
showed tax cards as had been done
.before at the shack on the old cam-
'pus. Thorne explained that it was
an entirely different operation and
the students were probably still
being offered the tax card bicycles.
He suggested that the students be
approached about it.

Someone asked what the policy
was on locking doors in the build-
ings on the academic podium. Thorne
said that one door to a building was
always unlocked but he didn't say
which one.

Thorne was also asked about the
possibility oi having the library
open later than 10 p.m. He said that
Library Council was working on it

" but getting the staff was the biggest
-problem.

Litter on Campus
The problem of keeping the cam-
pus looking nice was also discussed.
Areas that have already suffered
from student use are the floors in
the . humanities building and the ball-
room of the campus center.

Thorne stated that the University
was still working on getting aliquor
license and that there are many
problems involved. He again said
he would be surprised to see F.S.A.
get the license before next Septem-
ber. The dinner dance for senior
week, however, will be an exception
and have alcohol served at it.

Children who hear tone as noise
in short signals are likely to be
slow in learning language. Adults
with the same problem have diffi-
culty following one conversation
through a background. of interfering
noise.

Work Reported .
The three men reported on their
current work in two papers yester-
day, at the 73rd Convention of the

Acoustical Society of America atthe~

Statier-Hllton Hotel in New York
City. The papers are “Belation'be-
tween cerebral blood flow and time
required for tonal sensation in con-
ditioned rhesus monkeys," and "Im-
pairment and recovery in time re-
quired for tonal sensation in 57 pa-
tients selected for vertebral artery
surgery.”

Authors of Test

The authors are Warren Creel,
experimental surgery laboratory,
Albany Medical College, and Dr.
Boomsiiter, who together devised
the test, and Dr. Samuel R.Powers,
Jr., professor of surgery, Albany
Medical College, who uses the test
in suspected disorders of blood
supply to the brain.

The three-member team reported
that there is a time limit on tonal
sensation for everybody. If a regu-
lar musical note is sounded for a
very short time, less than a hun-
dredth of a second, it will be heard
not as a short whistle, but as just
a clock, without tonal quality, even
by normal listeners.

The tonal organizing process in

the nerve centers of hearing re-
quires a certain amount of time.

"it should prove to be quite a per-

Both are controversial figures

Terry Lickona, the other host of

New University Business F

Installed By International Group

The business fraternity at the Uni-
versity was installed last Saturday
as the Zeta Psi Chapter of the In-
ternational Fraternity of Delta Sig-
ma Pi. Brothers of the Delta Sigma
Pi Fraternity came from all over
the country to Albanyto install the
members of the new chapter. Greet-
ings were sent to the Albany Chap-
ter from the other chapters in the
international fraternity.

The highlight of the day was the
installation banquet which was a
four course steak dinner organized
by Daniel Dubin. After the dinner
Zeta Psi Chapter President Jeffrey
Warner cut a cake which bore the
inscription, "installation of Zeta
Pei Chapter of the International
Fraternity of Delta Sigma Pi April
iii, 196'],

Organization

The membersof Zeta Psi Chapter
organized about a year ago into
their own independent fraternity
which was named Alpha Sigma Up-
silon. Randolph Kundmueller, his"-
orian of the former Alpha Sigma
Upsilon Fraternity, said that the
members of the old fraternity strive
“to form a fraternity that was pro-
fessional in character.” The mem-
bers of Alpha Sigma Upsilon decided
after investigating the international
business fraternities that Delta Sig-
ma P1 was the fraternity they wanted
join. Dr. Milton C. Olsen, Dean
of the School of Business atthe Uni-
versity, was expressing the feeling
of the local chapter when he said,
“We are happy we can share with
the other dynamic organizations in.

this fraternity.

Initiation

Alpha Sigma Upsilon became Delta
Sigma Pi; Zeta Psi Chapter when
the business fraternity wasinitiated
into the international fraternity. At
the banquet Fred B. Wander, Vice
President of the former fraternity,
called the transition of Alpha Sig-
ma Upsilon to Delta Sigma Pi “a
further step of growth forthe School
of Business at the State University

of New York at Albany.”

M. John Markoof Rutgers Uni-
versity, Grand President of the in-
ternational fraternity, addressed the
members of Zeta Psi Chapter and
presented them with their charter.
Marko charged the members of the
new chapter to maintain their high

ideals, continue to develop their
characters, remember 
sponsibiiities, pursue their use]; '
ariy endeavors, and share theiproq
fessional interests of thefraternity.
He, at one part in his speech,statod
"The success of any one chin to
the concern of all.” ‘ "

Brown To Leave April ,26
To Study Criminal Justice

Dr. William P. Brown, a profes-
sor in the School of Criminal Jus-
tice at the University, leaves on
April 2’7 for Europe on the first part
of his 1967 research tour financed
by the National Institute of Mental
Health.

The work in its entirety is a
three-year study aimed at improv-
ing the police and general social
response to the problem of sexual
criminality.

Professor Brown has just com-
pleted a major study on police and
corruption which was requested by
the President's Commission on Law
Enforcement and the Administra-
tion of Justice, familiarly called
the National Crime Commission.

National Report Preparation

He participated in the prepara-
tion of the national report issued
in January and his study on cor-
ruption will be published by the
commission as one of its supportive
documents.

The Albany professor’s upcoming
trip will include visits at Amster-
dam, Hamburg, Copenhagen, and
Stockholm, where, in athree-week
period, he will be seeing some of
the most prominent European schol-
ars in the field of research in sex
crime. At Copenhagen he will lec-
ture before the psychiatric depart-
ment of the University Clinic.

In addition to consulting with those
involved in research, Professor
Brown will be seeing police person-

nel who have to deal with the prob-
lem of sexual criminality. Later on
in the summer he will return to
Europe to visit centers in ltaly and
France.

Program In Human Resources

While in the Graduate School of
Public Affairs at the University,
Professor Brown earlier directed
a program in human resources ad-
ministration designed to meet the
needs of those who anticipate ca-
reers in the government service
with agencies having program re-
sponsibilities to handle problems of
crime and other types of social
pathology. ,
