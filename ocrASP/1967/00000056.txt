Hail to the ASP for reliving old
nemories again and again and again.
How long must the student body be

igain on the sports page. How many
lears has the picture of a (name-
less) student rolling a bowiingbail

i recall seeing it at least twice in
:he ASP and once in the yearbook.

Although I didn't get a chance to
see Albany playing Plattsburgh last
year, it wasn’t necessary to relive
old memories by putting a picture
of that game in the paper alongside
an article on the Utica game.(These
are just two examples.)

Perhaps I'm being a little unfair
but even if the ASP is short-handed
it doesn't take any longer to take a
“new” picture at an athletic con-
test than to take one of someone
sliding on a mudiaden field or of
some pickets parading around in
N—Y-C (3 hours away from Albany
by traveling time).

I will agree it takes longer to
take a fresh photo than to go to
the file where perhaps the photos

would be rectified. But it seems
that the editors change but the
pictures remain the same. With
the great support the ASP has shown
to our expanding athletic program
it's a shame that they do not honor
our athletes with some recent photo-
graphs. In the future I hope the pic-

get a little mixed up.

Art Work Stolen

To the Editors:

It is time to bring to the attention
of the entire college community a
deplorable situation which exists on
this campus concerning art‘and art
exhibitions. The problem is twofold,
with one aspect much more serious
than the other. First, artwork is
being taken-stolen-from a number
of places. During the previous school
year two photographs by Joseph Al-
per were stolen from an exhibit in
the Draper gallery. As was an-
nounced in the student press some
time ago, a lithograph by Tom
O'Connor was stolen from the lounge
of the Colonial Quad. A Print by

Jack Bosson was taken at about the
same time. Now a sculpture byRob-
ert Tortorici, an art exhibit which
was held in Campus Center in March.

To complete the list of thefts, four
sculpture projects are gene from
the storage area in the library base-
ment, where sculpture classes are
being held. ‘

The other part of this situation is
that students and visitors have de-
veloped the habit of picking at and
handling art work around the cam-
pus. One of my own works, owned
by the Art Coordinating Committee,
has had three objects removed from
the surface. A number of projects
in the library basement have had
parts removed. My wall in the As-
sembly Hall of the Campus Center
is slowly being caressed down to its
original color before the final coat
of paint was applied.

I can offer no solution to all of
this except to appeal to the students
of this college to exhibit anew found
maturity about the art whichis being
exhibited and done around the cam-
pus. No amount of name-calling can
contribute to this maturity, nor can
suggestion that is being done by a
minute part of the student body, by
visitors, or by the faculty. It is
being done, and it is a threat to the

_ vitality of a number of programs.

Muddy Waters

"Muddy Waters is the man who
actually set the down home style
and made the beat both obvious
and throbbing.

“He was born McKinley Waters
in Rolling Fork, Miss. about a hun-
dred miles south of Clarksdale. He
began to play guitar when he was
seventeen, learning from such mas-
ters of bottleneck style as Son
House and Robert Johnson, upon
whom Muddy patterned his style.

In 1941 Alan Mmax recorded
him for the Library of Congress;

Muddy was working as a field hand, .

playing for dances and suppers on
weekends for fifty cents a night,
just to get a chance to sing. He
played a little harmonics and the
next summer joined a tent show
from New Orleans, when it came
through Clarksdale. Muddy played
the harmonica to accumpany blues
singers in the show, and occas-
ionally sang himself. The show
dropped him after a few weeks,
and Muddy went back to Clerks-
dale. He stayed there for a few
months and then left for Chicago.
lie was twenty-eight years old."
it was in 1945 and 1946 that
Muddy'a sound finally started to
catch on. With such song hits as
"Gypsy Woman," "Little Anna
Mae," and "I Feel Like Going
Home," the road was starting to
become a little smoother.

to be one of the most imitated bands
of its type in the country, espe-
cially in the International Pop Mu-

the band back to its rightful place.

The Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Jazz
Orchestra

"On a steaming July night in De-
troit in 1955 during a so-called
Battle of the Bands, adrummer with
Stan Kenton and a sideman with
Count Basie met and communicated.
'it was then that the idea for ‘Thad
Jones-Mel Lewis and The Jazz 0r-
chestra' was born.”

Thad Jones-Mel Lewis and “The
Jazz Orchestra" are now very much
in existence. They have their own
distinctive sound. It is music of
today, tomorrow and yesterday all
grouped into one tidy packageubig
band style. it is jazz at its finest.

The response to this band has
been nothing short of electric. The
word-of-moutb has spread as far
as Eastern Europe, and their ap-
audiencea wherever they have
played. They were honored by being
selected to play at the 1006Newport
Jazz Festival, where they shared
billing with Count Basie, Duke El-
lington and Woody Herman.

Thad Jones-Mel Lewis and “The
Jazz Orchestrd are the talk of the
jazz world and the biggest thing to
hit in many seasons.

These are but two of the groups
that will be at the festival. The
two-day affair has been fought for,
argued about, cried over and al-
most died for. But it's finally here
and if simply to see what all the
trouble has been for, you should
come. Tickets are available at the
Campus Contdr between 9 a.m. and
a p.m. i guarantee that they are well
worth the moiwa yqu,.will.,eoend.

Another Theft

To the Editors:

Our new campus has provided the
space and facilities for advantageous
activities for the student body. One
of these is the gallery area in the
campus center. For the first time
it is possible to display large art
exhibits.

This semester the first student
art show was presented displaying
paintings, sculpture of varying med-
ia, and ceramic works.Unfortunata-
ly, because of the lack of guards,
or police of any kind and the pre-
supposition ol the student integrity,
one of the works shown is missing.

A marble sculpture about ten
inches high by Robert Tortoricl is
the missing work. His pending job
is dependent upon a viewing of this
sculpture. Information or the sculp-
ture may be given anonymously to
Miss Susan Rose, Student Activi-
ties Office, Campus Center.

This incident does not only affect
Mr. Tortorici, but everyone in the
campus community. If the students
cannot be trusted to appreciate the
artistic and personal value of the
objects shown, there can be no show-
ings, no paintings, no posters
nothing to stimulate or reﬂect aes-

thetic interest.

So the women’s hours have finally becomes reality:
women may sign out for the next day.or the next seven
days as they‘wish. 'It appears there is only one big
crux of the matter-finding a plausible place for which
to sign out. It’s difficultio sign out for the library
overnight since it’s not open past 10:00 p.m.. and it’s

not open past 12:00 midnight.
It is against ‘Memos From Minnie’

to\sign out for

any apartmentor hotel in the Albany-Schenectady-Troy

Area.

Presently the Committee on Student Residences has
undertaken a revision of “Memos” and “Student
Guidelines.” At present they have presented sugges-
tions for revision to LAAC for consideration. and after
LAAC gives its recommendations it will return to

Student Residences.

It is hopeful that the new revision will accommodate
a legal way for a sign out; at present RAs may find
themselves in rather ‘a tight situation, because ob-
viously some students aren’t going to be signed out
for correct destinations. This creates the problem of
,an ability to get in touch with a girl in the case of an

actual emergency.

By the way. what happened to the sealed envelopes
which would be opened only in case of emergency?

Unless this situationis completely rectified to
allow free and honest signing out, without fear of
University infringement on where you can go, the
whole purpose of women’s hours will be defeated.
Instead of encouraging freedom it will create a situ-
ation in which a lot of people will have to look the
other way (did you ever sign out all night for
“movie”?), and the University women will remain
the proverbial girls after all.

LITTLE BOYS: An interesting
footnote to IFC's game session oc-
curred this week. After vigorously
denying that PBS would fail to gain
fraternity status if they changed
their name, IFC then refused this
status to them after they changed
their name.

Some people seem to think that
one needs a few years experience
to wear jackets, live~ together, and
throw parties. They also think that
you need so many members that
true brotherhood is unrealistic, to
be a fraternity.

On most campuses {rats have
about 30 members. We are the ex-
ception, not the rule. ignoring these
groups won't make them go away,
kiddies. You can grow up even if
your jackets are black, red, or
light blue. Do it.

CONGRATS: to Soph class,et.al.
for a fine weekend. If we could got
four weekends a year like this plus
a few Council For Contemporary
Music offerings, we would be on
the right track.

MUMBLINGS: Is it really better
to have a bunch of reckless idiots
tearing around walkways on bikes
than licensed drivers in cars?

WATCH YOUR STEP: Are those
ditches all over campus to be filled
in with trees or have seeds been
planted? This place looks like a

cross between the moon's surface
and God’s pegboard.

BOOKSTORE: It may be good busi-
ness sense to liquidate your stock
of paperbacks, etc. before moving,
but a booxstore should also serve a
service function to students unable
to walk to Coionie Center. Some
students do read books that are not
required.

Does it make a hell of a lot of sense

ful holes in it so that you can't help

last year. Who ever said that SUNYA

there any truth to the rumor that

Production-A

’ by'ems kaurmun

"Carnival" the 1967 State Uni-

night and tomorrow night in Page

' Hall beginning at '8 o'clock each

evening. Tickets are still available

. for these performances and may be

secured at the information desk at

The "Carnival" story began last
June when Director John Folia chose
the show during a phone conversa-
tion with me. We had read many
different scripts and it was a gen-
eral consensus that "Carnival"
should be done. Because of the
show’s simplicity it seemed to be
perfect for SUNYA.

The simplicity of "Carnival" has
turned out to be one of the largest
undertakings ever to be accom-
plished by students at this Univer-
sity. Every phase of production

British Comedy ‘Too Good’
‘Goorgy Girl" Bursts With Life

by Douglas Rothgeb

After many, many years of watchingBritish com-
edies and comparing them incessantly with the typical
American product, I am convinced beyond all doubt
that the British are simply too good for us. The best

we seem to be able to do

is to copy them. and even

then we usually make a mess of things.

I suppose I would have
felt this same way whether
I had seen “Georgy Girl”
or not; but having seen and
enjoyed it immensely is
just to hammer the final
nail into the Hollywood
comedy coffin.

"Georgy Girl,” like the whole
flock of recent English comedy suc-
cesses -- “The Knack," “Rotten
to the Core," “A Hard Day’sNight”
"Morgan" and “The Wrong Box"--
is virtually bursting at the seems
with vitality, seething with life and
movement and merrily unaware of
itself.

No Drippy Sentiment
Without the least bit of drippy
sentiment it tells an essentially
sappy story of a modern Ugly Duck-
ling, her ups, downs, and ups.
Georgy (Lynn Redgrave) is a sad
thing indeed. With a face like a

T Fourth Time Around

by Igor Koroluk

When I left the Blues Project
Concert Sunday afternoon I couldn’t
help from feeling terribly disap—
pointed. Disappointed in ihat,ldidn't

) get tickets for both shows and in

that I probably would never appre-
ciate their recordingsagain. They
were in fact the classic group, one
that had to be seen to be believed.

The emotions, sights, and sounds
affected by the Project can only be
fully appreciated in person. To hear
them is like being in an all on-
veloping womb of experience. Their
music appeals to all the senses
especially when viewed under the
adept handling ofiightingofSunday's
performance.

From the beginning with "i Can’t
Keep From Crying" to their spec-
tacular fifteen minute plus finale,
"Wake Me-Shake Me," i found my-
self completely engrossed, enam-
ored, and overwhelmed with the
versatility and sheer power the
group displayed.

The Blues Project is definitely
a group of outstanding, accomplished
and imaginative musicians; last Sun-
day they made use ofall their ability
to bring the academic podium to a
spirited height it will probably never
realise again.

It's no wonder this group is great
with such outstanding personalities
as Al Kooper and Denny Kalb, both

    
  

who have backed up many of the big
names in folk. Al Kooper is famous
for his overdubbing experiments in
which he not only sang but also
played every instrument. Denny Kalb
is considered one of the finest

guitarists in folk music and has
worked with Bob Dylan, among
others.

Highlight of the program wastheir
extended and improvised version of
“Flute Thing.” With this place they
made total use of their own innova-
tion the electric flute. As my date
noted this number follows the pat-
tern of classical music with the
statement. of a theme, followed by
extension and development on this
theme, ending with 'a restatement
of the thematic melody.

Their versatility lnarrangements
ran the gammet from Jimmy Reed’s
hard blues "Caress Me Baby” tothe
poetic, mystical strains of "Steve’s
Song." Also worth noting is the
newly released single "No Time is
the Right Time," their first attempt
at making the “lift” market after
two successful albums.

The Blues Project just might have
been the biggest and best thing to
hit this campus in as long a time
as I can remember. Those who
didn't see the concert can still buy
their albums and think they're the
greatest. We who saw the concert
are not as fortunate; we found out
you can't capture the Blues Project
on record.

friendly hippo and a body like a
truck driver, she is the ultimate in
walli'iowers. Dwarfed by the mod
beauty of her roommate (Charlotte
Rampllng), who every night becomes
further and further removed from
virginity by her hyper-throldic lo-
thario (Alan Bates), Georgy sits
in the shadows, so concerned for the
happiness of others that she neg-
lects herself.

Pursued by a well—past middle-
aged suitor (James Mason) who
wants to make Georgy his mistress,
Georgy gradually begins to work her
way out of her cocoon until finally
she herself finds the happiness that
she thought she would never find.

Sounds Treucly

If that description sounds treacly,
the film is anything but. The film
moves so quickly that if there is
any sentimentality ﬂoating about,
it never gets a chance to settle and
spoil everything.

The credit for the success of this
marvelous little film belongs to an
astute director and three marvelous
actors. Silvio Narizzuno keeps
everything moving beautifully, but
the talented threesome of Redgrave,
Bates and Mason really seem to
need no direction at all.

Redgrave Magnificent

Lynn Redgrave, to spare a whole
list of well-deserved superlatives,
is just magnificent, and IknowI
shall hear considerable disagree-
mont when I say that Alan Bates
steals the show. Anyway, they take
turns at it. Bates is an inspired
madcap; there was barely amoment
when he wasn't getting howls of
laughter from the audience.

James Mason, as we have come
to expect, gives a performance that
is just plain classy. Professional is
written all over him.

I don't know when the next British
comedy is due over here in the
Comedy Wasteland, but if it is
anywhere near as hip and hyster-
ically funny as “Georgy Girl" it
is worth waiting years for.

In addition to the cast's chores on
stage, on which they have worked
very hard, they have contributed an
amazing amount of work in the shop
and costume room and have spent
many overnight hours in Page to
make sure that “Carnival” is a big

have worked on this production.
There have been so many faces
around the rehearsal area that I
could not possibly know all their'

William Schaeffer was very val-

I must say a very humble “thank

all the support and help that she
has given to “Carnival.”

"Carnival" is a beautiful produc-

the show, volunteers will be invited
to come to the main tent anaa to
participate in a magic act."Magic”
is one of the words that goes syn-
onymous with "Carnival." There
are magical songs, magical per-
formers, and a magical story.
