gineers in the homeopener 'oi‘ the season. On'hand,

as usual, will be Albany’s most avid fanyMrs. Martha
Egleston of the History Department to throw out the

first ball. Mrs. Egleston has had the honor-for over
10 years now, and each year the pre-game ceremony

' is one to watch with pride and excitement. '
Unfortunately, we cannot say the same of what will
follow, namely the contest itself. Mrs. E gleston’s

son, Tom, will be hurling

for the Danes. and we’re

sure he’ll give a fine account of himself. After all,
he handcuffed the Engineers easily lastyearinbeating
them 5—1, for the first taste of victory that Coach Bob
Burlingame has enjoyed over the visitorsme across
the Hudson since he came to Albany eight years ago.
In"this game, the Danes really showed their muscle
at the plate. getting at least a dozen hits. with the big
blow a booming 425 foot last over the center field
fence by the then first baseman, Denny Elkin. Since
-that game, Egleston has improved considerably. As
Tom, himself put it: “All my pitches are working so'
far this year. I have used my fast ball, Curve ball,
and screw ball successfully. Defensively, it shou.d
be a case of using the right pitch at the right time.”
Although the team’s pitching has improved greatly,
its hitting has not. In their three losses, the Danes
have accumulated a grand total of 12 hits. two of
which have been for extra bases, which goes to show

that the boys haven’t been

exactly ripping the cover

off the old apple. This lack of hittingis what makes us
pessimistic about the team’s chances against RPI today
and the SienaVIndians tomorrow, a contest which the
diamondmen will face in Mike Flynn the best hurler

in the area.

A striking fact is that in the three games played
so far, the Danes have accumulated more hits than
the opposition. Actually. it is not so striken when
one considers that our squad is blessed with ex—
ceptional pitching; but the few hits that the opponents
did get combined with a couple of walks and some
errors produced the 2 or 3 runs which 'were enough
for victory. It all goes to show that you can have
the best pitching in the world, but if you can’t score,
you can’t win. The Dodges found this out last fall.

This all points to the fact that the Danes will be on
the defensive most of the time, scratching. scramb—
ling, or poking away to try to score a runor two.
This could have disasterous effects over the season

on a team that has 17 members,

7 of which are

pitches. As Egleston put it: “We could break out any

time and have a big inning."

That “could” looms

large and we hope that that “big inning” comes to-
day. It could be mighty tense.

Varsity Linksman McCloat

Sports Editor

by Hank Rubinewitz

Relatively new to the
game of golf, junior Ray
McCloat has made remark-
able progress. With the
season just underway, Ray
has been selected the num—
ber one man.

In the summer of his sophomore
year in high school, McCloat played
his first game of golf. For the next
two years the sport held a casual
interest for him. Early inthe spring.
of his freshman year at Albany, the
golf team was short of players; Ray
decided to Join. Since then he has
shown marked improvement. Last
year he played in the third and
fourth position. This year he is
number one, with a six handicap.

Golf is not the only sport Ray
has participated in. in high school
he was an eight letter man, com-
peting in cross country, basketball

. and track. In AMlA sports he has
represented Potter Club in football,
basketball, and bowling, with all-
star nominations in football and
basketball.

Headers being an active partici-
pant in sports, liay has held a
number of positions in campus or-
ganizations. lie was our sports edi-
tor for four semester. This year
he is chairman of MYSKANIA and

‘ Face Stone Saturday

The Great Danes ,will also be in
action tomorrow when they will host
the Siena indians again at 3 p.m.
Coach Burlingame will choose his
starting hurler from a list that in-
cludes: Cas Galka, who pitched a
fine game against Utica but may not
be ready to go again by Saturday,
Tom Piotrowski, who threw well
in relief against Oswego, and George
Webb, who also looked good against
Oswego.

The prospective starting lineup
for this weekend's game includes:
Captain Andy Christian at third,

Denny Elkin at short, Paul Leonetti »

at second, Webb or Jack Sinnott at
first, and Jim Murley, Bob Lode
and Art Stein or Sinnott patroilng
the outfield.

Sleno Will Be Tough

Albany, now 0-3, will probably
face stiff competition from Siena
who are presently 3-0 and will most
likely be going with their ace hurler,
Bob Flynn. The two squads split
their games last year and here too
the Danes will be looking for their
second consecutive win in an arm
rivalry.

Coach Burlingame has been
pleased by the Great Danes hurling
thus far, however, their hitting still
has not jelled, perhaps due to the
lack of outside practice, thanks to
the inclement weather. The coach
has also cited the rapid adaptations
which Stein and Elkin have made in
the field. Stein, who is playing the
outfield this year for the first time
and Elkin, a converted first base-
man who is now at short, have both
made some fine plays in the field.

Hathaway Expresses Hope

As Coach Merlin Hatha-

of Fairleigh Dickinson and
Adelphi and the boys need

The varsity tennis mentor grac-

and provide the substance for this
article.

"This year we have one of our
more promising squads but most
of the colleges we are to play have
improved immensely," he offered.

Utica, a team which had been
practicing inside for some time
was an easy mark. Osweog, who
beat State badly last year, was con-
sidered stronger by the coach. They

Council. last
Thursday night, approved
a proposed Constitutional
Amendment that would, if
it is ratified by the Stu-
dent Association, limit the
voting power of the Cen-
tral Council President.

if it is ratified by the Student
Association, the members of Stu-

approve or reject the amendment
on a referendum which will be held

elections during April 25 to April

Presently the Student Association
Prsident has the right to vote in
Central Council since he must rep-
resent his contituency. If the amend-
ment is passed, the element that
elected the person who becomes
President would elect another per-
son to represent them on Central
Council. The amendment also states
that the President shall not act as
a representative of the body that
elected him to Central Council.

The president would be allowed

under the proposed amendment.’l‘he
new addition to the Constitution de-
fines the office of president of Cen-

Student Association. Nowhere in the
Student Association Constitution is
there a definition of who is the
President of the Association.

Central Council also approved a
new constitution for the Commis-
sion for Academic Affairs. The
constitution has abolished the com-
mission boards. It was felt by the

the boards had proven unworkable

to indicate how well informed the
people at State are regarding par-
lit'ulm‘s for the creation of a foot-
ball team.

Although 32.50% of those polled
indicated that there were no funds

ity there are presently sufficient
funds to create and maintain a
sixty 1mm squad.

According to Dr. Werner the ini-

cated that 111.51% were willing to
have over $50,000 used for initiating
a team. Only 5.81% indicated the
proper price range.

When asked how much of a raise
