Football If...

The results of the football poll con-
ducted by Beta Phi Sigma indicate that
86% of the undergraduates, graduates
and faculty favor football here. We en-
dorse this opinion under one condition.

The condition is that money is not
alloted from Athletic Advisory board
or any other Student tax funded organ-
ization to be used to attract athletes
here. There was a proposal recently
presented to A.A. Board which re-
quested that funds to be used to en-
tertain prospective athletic type stu-
dents for a weekend to convince them
to attend this school. i

This proposal has now been referred
to the President’s Committee on Inter~
collegiate Athletics. We were opposed
to having football on campus until we
discovered that football scholarships
could not be given out. Now this too is
being considered.

We are afraid that once money is
alloted to bring “top” athletic stars
here, any chance for fame for aca—
demics will be decreased. We tend to
think that once athletics gain impor—
tance, academics suffer.

Scholarship aid to athletes isn’t fair
to sudents who don't have athletic
ability or anyone with talents in other
areas, like studying.

Maybe if we gave scholarships to
athletes we should give them to drama
majors to aid the State University Thea-
tre in acquiring a big name or we could
give the money to the Council for Con—
temporary Music to draw a big name
like Zal Yanovsky as a student here.

We were under the impression that
a football team would be established

to provide entertainment for football
fans, not to become the sole reason
for the existence of the school.

Sports fans will probably insist that
the team will be a failure if we can’t
have money to attract “stars” but most
people who took part in the football poll
indicated that they didn’t expect the
team to be a winning team immed-
iately. Can’t athletes be trained or do
they have to be bought?

lie Honors This Year

Now that we have mentioned athletics,
we must mention the fact that there is
no Honors Convocation this year. We
couldn’t find out exactly why. but it
seems there was a lack of support by
people who should have worked on it.

It seems to us that last year’s 'con—
vocation was hailed as a step in the
right direction of recognizing academic
achievement. Yet this year it doesn’t
exist.

Perhaps the Honors Convocation is
another case of misplaced responsi—
bility. By the time Signum Laudis de-
cided not to do it and the task was as—
signed to Academic Affairs Commis—
sion which was to plan it with MYS-
KANIA, it was too late for it this year
anyway.

It doesn’t matter much that it was
too late because the Faculty Committee
on Honors and Awards which decides
the people to receive some ofthe awards
given, hasn’t been active this year.

Maybe there will be a Honors Con-
vocation next year, if everyone doesn’t
just dismiss the whole thing with the
thought “What Honors Convocation?”
it was a nice thought to honor academic
achievement while it lasted.

To the Editors:

The cartoon of the Faculty-Stu-

reﬂects the all-encompassing and
monopolistic operations of this or-

most unreasonable form of this or-
ganization is the fact that Food
Service is compulsory for resident
students.

Though the proponents of Food
service will gladly cite the increase
in fringe services (ice cream,etc.),
they neglect the central issue of
whether the quality and/or nutri-
tional value oi the food has im-
proved. ice cream odds calories

Photographers Needed

To the Readers:

in Friday's ASP, there appeared
a legitimate complaint concerning
the photographs which appear on the
sports page. A criticism was made
to the fact that a photo of a last
season ball game appeared in con-
junction with this season's article.
This isindaedunfortunato. However,
considering the fact that the State
baseball team had not playodahomo

that page, certainly it can be un-
derstood why a more recent photo
could not appear.

Other excuses could be offered
in an attempt to pardon myself and
the other members of the sports
staff. Excuses are helpless, how-
ever, ln trying to find a soluiion
to the obvious problem.

The answer is, of course, more
ASP photographers. Readers who
have an interest in photography and
are interested in seeing the quality
of the sports photography improved
are indeed welcome to iointhe sin".

As the situation is now, the read-
ers cannot expect a handful of, men
to cover all the events going on in
the campus scene, both home and
away.

The answer to the problem boils
down to the basic axiom: quantity

makes uaiiiy.
q Glelui Saplr
Associate Sports Editor

 

by Martin Schwartz

In the past several months, sev-
eral members ofthe administration,
led by Vice-President Thorne, have
expressed doubt as to the general
atmosphere on this campus toward
the setting up of a football team.

Recently, President Collins began
to set up a committee to advise him
on intercollegiate athletics, includ-
ing football. The catch is that athle-
tics on this campus are financed by

’student funds, through Athletic Ad-
visory Board.

To find out exactly what the stu-
dents want on this campus, Beta
Phi Sigma, one of the colony fra-
ternities hero, undertook a well-
done survey to test student knowl-
edge and opinion. The results may
be found elsewhere in the paper.

What is most important is that
80.12% ofthe undergraduates, grads,
and faculty stated that they wanted
a football team started here at Al-
bany. This figure is based on 2,240
people who answered the question-
naire.

This finding is exciting as it is
the greatest consensus ever to be
found here since students were asked
if they wanted bathrooms on campus.
It is obvious that once and for all
the question has been decided as to
whether football is wanted.

The next important step is the
acquisition of money. This is not
really important as AA Board has
over $150,000 in its possession al-
ready, ready to be used for football.

In addition, almost one-third of the
respondanis said that they would
tolerate a $1.00 admission charge
to all games.

If mor'e money is needed, which
is highly unlikely unless we gold-
piate the field, 03.7% said that they
would suppori a $1 to $5 raise in
student inx, while ll.02‘}t would
support a tax hike of over $5.

Next problem. As most students
realized, there are no plans for a
siadium to be built, and the besi
that we could hope for would be
bicacher seating. Luckily, 88.20 of
tho rcspondanis (including faculty)
said that they were willing in go
along with this.

"ARM" i hear you say. What
happens lo the suppori when the
team sturis losing? Well, the sup-

iiver The Counterintelligence l

port that the questio raire presents
was obtained while only 26.34% had
high hopes for a winning team in
the beginning.

Very few people here were un-
realistic. Only 15% in both cases
(probably the same 15%) either ex-
pected us to have Big Ten or lvy
League style play.

Another interesting finding was
that 77.17% were willing to see
more spent on football per year
than actual estimates say will be
spent. Many more of the remaining
22.83% were willing to spend the
estimated figure.

For some reason, as it was ex-
plained by President Collins, al—
though the students have the money
and the facilities to start a new
sport, only the administration can
take such a step.

The President has set up a com-
mittee to advise him as to whether
he should take this step, as l men-
tioned before. This committee has
not met, so they will have theoppor—
tunity at their first meeting to have
facts at their disposal when they
discuss football.

some action should be taken on
this issue immediately. Games could
probably be scheduled now for nexi
fall with such clubs (not teams) as
Siena, Marisi, N.Y.U. and Fordham.
These clubs are all student run and
coached. The experience in playing
a few games would be valuable for
those students who would be playing
under better conditions the following
year.

A team could be chosen now from
the fine talent shown in A.M.T.A.
play, that could begin pl‘m'llce, get
in shape on their own over the
summer, and perhaps come upeni‘ly
in September to begin work.

Tilers is no reason to spend a
year debating the merits of a foot-
bnii icum. A content analysis of
the ASP morgue will show that
these debates have been going on
for over ten years.

We have the money, talent, spare,
community support (see Tom Cun-
ningham of the Albany Times-
Uulon), and the school support to
start and maintain a football team
immediately. All [but we are lack-
ing is support from the Adminis—
trution.

I hope that ii is forthcoming us
soon as possible, if not sooner.

For Extended Women’s Hours

Special from Union Concordlensis
by Barry Newman

ALSkidmore College in Saratoga
Springs, seniors have won exten-
sions of daily and weekend curfews,
and students are hoping for eventual
relaxation across all class levels,
The weekday limit for remaining
away from the dormitory was raised
to 12:30 a.m. for seniors and to
“:30 p.m. for all other women.
Seniors may now return as late as
2 a.m. Friday and Saturday nights,
while a 1 am. curb is retained for
undcrclassmen.

students at Russell Sage College
are also asking for liberalizations.
A proposal to stretch the current
weekday curfew io 11 p.m. for sen-
iors and lo p.m. for the balance of
the all women’s school is under
consideration by the Common Coun-
cil, a student-faculty group.

A student at all male Union who
frequents Albany State was relieved.
The new rules eliminate “the mad
dash to the door" just before cur-
few, he sald, and on dates that are
not quite successful “girls won’t
feel obligated any longer to use up
all their time."

At Skldmore, a student committee
called SWAT (Skidmore Women As-
sert Themselves) worked with the
Dean of Students to formulate its
proposal, passed last month by the
Common Council, a Strident-Faculty
legislature with the power to im-
plement changes.

The student body president, Janet
Reder, does not expect drastic re-
form oi Skidmore's hours until a
new means is found for communi-
cation wlih all students. Announce-
ments
are certain to reach everyone.

The administration, according to
Miss Reder, is concerned primarily
with the students’ safety, while stu-
dents generally "want to make up
their own minds.”

MlSS Reder doubts that women’s
rooms will ever be opened to male
visitors because “the dorms are
not set-up for it."

At a number of women’s colleges,
including Bennlngton in Vermont,
curfews are minimal and men are
permitted in the women’s rooms.

The only problem one could see
with Robert Clayton is that hewas
not on stage long enough--hc had
a true comic presentation and in
his role as Dr. Glass, well, a gem
of an actor.

Perhaps the weakest link in this
production was lighting--it did not
lend itself to the tender moments
of the play, and there was definitely
too little of it on the puppets.

Stage Crowded

The stage appeared crowded, but
yet lended itself to every scene.
The settings by Deanehan were much
like the original Broadway showing,
and the costumes by Michaels were
gay and lively. The make-up by
Wilcox, while good on the leads,
lacked on all supportingcharaciers,
