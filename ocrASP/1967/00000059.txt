Albany State began a new page in
its sports history Saturday when
the freshmen members of the Al-
bany State track club traveled to
Cobleskiil to take part in the Coble-

And amazingly enough, in their
first meet ever, competing against
16 other schools, the Great Danes
came up with a first place finisher.

Albany State opened its 1067 golf
season on Thursday, April 2'7 with
a 4 1/2-4 1/2 tie against Utlca at
the McGregor Golf Club in Saratoga
Springs. Although the match was
scheduled to be played at the Nor-

Returning leitermsn Fred Nelson,
a Junior from Amsterdam, shot an
impressive 84 and won an individ-

Brian Hill defeated his opponent
and shot an 83, the best sore this
year for the Albany linksmen.

Bill Pendergast, a junior from
Troy tied ills opponent in the match,
and also tied for an individual point.
Hill also tied in his match.

Last year's outstanding frosh,
Peter Ferguson, won his match

turning lettcrman, sr'Ol‘ed a 00 on
the course, and Craig Luther, a
transfer from Delhi Tech and this
year's number one man, lost his
match.

Last year, Utica beat the Danes
twice, so the tie this year is some
improvement. The team's next
match is on Wed., April 26, against
Hamilton, and it will be played at
home at the Normanside Country
Club at 2:00. Albany has never
defeated ilamllton.

On Thursday, April 2'7, is another
important match against LeMoyne.
Play will be held in Syracuse. Round-
ing out the week willbean encounter
with New Paltz and will be played
at the \Vyltwyck Course in Kingston.

An important date to rememberis
May 3 when the linkers will partici-
pate in the Capital City Invitational
Tournament. This key match willbe
held at the McGregor Golf Course.
RPI and Stone are entered in the
contest.

Basil Morgan, after capping two
preliminaries. sped to a 9.9 win in
the 100 yard dash.

Morgan Impressive in 220
Morgan also made the finals in
the 220 as he won his semi—final
heat in 24.0, but he pulled a muscle
in doing so and had to withdraw.
Other runners who looked good to
Coach Munsey were Terry Mathias

who reached the semi-finals in both 1

the 100 and the 220, Paul Roy who
run a good half—mile in the medley
relay, and Charley Hart who looks
like a promising middle distunce
runner.

The froslnncn will be in action
again tomorrow when they will travel
to Utica for the Mohawk Valley C.C.
relays. Couch Munsey also plans to
take sophomore Mike Attwell along
to compete in the open mile.

Varsity Goes To LoMoyna
The varsity who were rained out
at Williams earlier, will get their
first real test on Monday, May 1
when they will compete in the Le-
Moyne Relays.

As is normally the case with a
club team Coach Munsey intends
that this should be a building year.
Neither the freshmen nor the var-
sity, who will be running together
in dual matches during the year,
has any field entries, as Coach
Munsey is concentrating on the track
events in orderio build a solid nu-
cieus for next year, when track is
expected to take its rightful place
alongside the other seven varsity
sports.

IFG To Present Thriller,
Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho

Alfred Hitchcock's demonic
“Psycho” is tomorrow night's se-
lectlon to be shown by the Inter-
national Film Group.

An instant commercial success,
"Psycho" was also praised by dis-
cerning critics as an enormously
effective work of cinema ari."Sighi
(a Sound" wrote "Its virtues of
tension, surprise, virtuosity, and
control are all major ones."

John Russell Taylor declared,
" 'Psycho' is the most thrilling of
thrillers; even Hitchcock himself
has never bettered some of its
shock effects... It is also the most
savagely amusing of black comed—
ies, balancing us, even at its most
horrifying, on the knife-edge where
there is almost no distinction be-
tween a laugh and a scream."
