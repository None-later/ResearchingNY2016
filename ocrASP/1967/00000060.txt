COMM UNI CA TIONS

Photographers Speak

To the Editors:

Recently there have been letters
appearing in this column concern-
ing the sports photos which appear
in the ASP. Everyone has had their
say but the people who are respon-
sible for these photographs. So we
would like to express our feelings.

As for the first letter concerning
the repetition of various photo-
graphs, we are and have been trying
to remedy this situation. May we
remind you that when aphotographer
spends eight hours traveling with a
team to take one new picture for
the paper, his work is stilinot done.
He does not take the film to the
drugstore to be processed. Chances
are the picture is needed for the
next paper. The photographer must
develop, wash, and print the film
himself, a process which takes at
least an hour and a half. And since
that will not be the only picture in
the paper, the whole process must
be repeated. The photographer
usually spends four hours in the
darkroom before a paper isprinted.

There are actually no ASP photo-
graphers as such. in fact, aliphoto-
graphy that is done for the ASP is
done by PHOTO SERVICE, an or-
ganisation involved with many other
publications besides the newspaper.
We have already pointed out the
vast amount of time that goes into
the taking and printing ofapicture
for the newspaper, Yet consider the

fact that photo service not only not

takes pictures for the ASP, but also
pictures for Campus Viewpoint, the
1..

Torch, the Summer Planning Con-
ference bulletin, Observation, Bus-
iness fraternities, Young Republi-
cans, young lovers and Aunt Matilda.
We are not complaining. We are
merely pointing out some of the
reasons why once in awhile apic-
tui‘e may have to be repeated. Be-
sides, how many different ways
are there to throw a bowling ball?

State Of Confusion

To the Editors:

Apropos your article oi April 21
regarding the Vietnam Referendum
and one on April 25 concerning the
results of a football poll: there
seems to be a state of confusion
concerning the relative importance
of two issues that were set before.
the student body for a vote. in the
April 25 issue of the ASP, a mini-
‘scule headline was given to what is
perhaps the most burning contem-
porary issue. The coverage of the
Vietnam Referendum was not at all
indicniwe of the significance of the
issue.

Upon first examining the article
on the war referendum, one might
assume that this is the type of cov-
erage the ASP gives to all refer-
endums. However, upon noting the
size and extensive detail of the
article on the football poll, it is
to obvious that this assumption
is invalid. Are we to suppose that
the formation of a football team at

SUNYA is more important than a
war in which people are beingkilled,
maimed and wounded.

It is not only appalling that this
tremendous error in values exists,
but, that the student body allows it
to exist and, in fact, by their ap-
parent apathy encourages this indi-
rect form of editorializlng, We, two
of many concerned members of the
student body, wish to make our opin-
ion known with the hope that future
issues of the ASP will not display
this type of mediocrity.

The Jazz

by Lou Strong

_..‘1

As many of you know, show busi-
ness can be a very fickle and funny
thing. As well as being fickle, it
can be very dangerous. Things that
click in New York will never make
it in Texas. Many times, all an
artist or production needs is some
exposure to gain the poise that is
necessary to makeitinternationally.

These same ideas hold true with
music. But, another idea that is
twice as important in music and
especially so with jazz, is that
many artists, disgusted with Amer-
ican audiences and commercialism,
will travel to Europe in the hope
of the. recognition they deserve. In»
many instances, this had led to
their acceptance in this country.
For others, it has led to happiness
in Europe and discontent with Amer-
lca.- Examples of both cases can be
seen in the many European tours
made by Art Farmer, Chet Baker,
and Ted Curson.

Ted Curson is one individual who
is at home in botii environments.
Ted has been called one of the best
up and coming jazz stars in the
business right now. After doing a
long stint with Charles Mingus’
group, he started out on his own
and proceeded to make quite a
name for himself. "Downbeat" mag-
azine, in its International Jazz Crit-
ics’ Poll, gave Ted a berth in its
"New Stars—Talent Deservlng Wider

years straight. “Jazz Podium," the

Review I

awarded Ted its “New Jazz Artist
of 1902" prize.

As well as these awards, Ted
has worked in such well-known clubs
as "Birdland," N.Y.C., the “Village
Vanguard," “Minton’s Playhouse,”
Montreal’s "The Penthouse,” Oslo,
Norway’s “Metropol,” and Paris’
“Blue Note.” He has played in some
of the country's better known festi—
vals, among them the famous Mon-
terrey Jazz Festival, and the Tlvoli
Gardens Festival in Copenhagen.
And now, he comes to State.

Along with Ted Curson and llic
quartet will be one of the little—
heard-of legends in jazz: Walter
Bishop Jr. This is a man who re-
ceives nothing but pleasure in doing
what he does so well, playing some
of the most beautiful piano this sun-
of Nirvana. Bishop has been in you
since the “early days" of bop ni
Minton’s place in New York. He has
played with the greats and with thr-
greatest: Charles Parker, who 1:.
considered by us all to be the Gut!
of Modern Jazz.

There really isn’t that murh lIiiil
can be said about Waiter Bishop
save that he is a very beautiful
pianist and has had more exper-
ience with more great jazz musi—
cians than State has pillars! Sim-c
1955, he has led his own trio and
is doing many beautiful things with
it.

Walter Bishop and Ted Clil‘SUii
are but two of the artists that will
be on hand for Festival Weekcn'l.
See you at the Festival.

 

‘Carniual' Praised

To the Editors:

This past weekend, the State Uni-
versity witnessed another memor-
able moment in its history - the
State University Revue's newest
production, "Carnival." .

The show, composed in its en-
tirety by a cast and production staff
of Albany State students, shown in
every aspect, and was enjoyed by a
full house of applauding audience.

The play carried smoothly and
kept everyone's interest throughout
the two and one half hour perfor-
mance, and I myself join the ap-
plause and congratulationp which are
in order to John Foils for an excel-
ent job in directing, as well as tr:
the whole production staff and per-
forming cast. They are a true asset
to this institution and we are all
very proud of them.

student affairs, againurged students The Rabinowitz lectures are given
to try and avoid walking on newly bi-weekly Monday and Thursday at

seeded lawns and playing fields
Monday at the President’s Confer-
once.

The problem was first brought up
at the Apr. 18 Conference, when the
Administration reported receipt of
several letters from contractors
complaining of this situation.

Thorne announced that a three
step plan has been instituted to
alert students to this problem, and
to the areas in question (see map
above).

Thorne has enlisted support of
the Student Association, the living
areas, and the news media in car-
rying out this campaign.

One problem is that many of these
areas are still technically not the
University's property; the Univer-
sity acquires finished areas from
the contractors in question after the
construction has been completed and
accepted by the University.

President Collins commented one
question of why the lights on the ten-
nis courts go out at 10 p.m. nightly.

Collins explained that the Physi-
cal Education Department stated that
at present the student assistantem-
played by the Physical Education
Department until 10 p.m. nightly
asks a member of the Security
Force to turn out the lights upon
leaving.

The Physical Education Depart-
ment said that presently there has
been no need to keep the lights on
past 10 p.m., but that the lights can
be left on until 11:00 p.m. if there
is a need or request.

Collins also urged students to
