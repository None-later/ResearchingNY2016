. I 'i‘roj. day, May 2, 1967

The results of Sunday’s elections for officers of the
1967268 Central Council ieftus infuriated and deflated.
' bout a chance of healthy opposition
Cleveland and Mishkin grabbed up the top two offices
of the Student Association to. add to a string of others

presently held by‘ each.
Both Cleveland and Mishkin are members of MT:

which has come to
machine on campus. There are now seven members of
STB on Central Council, as well asacouple of “loyal”
voters whose sympathies are publicly STB. Add to
this the votes of tw0 possibly ineligible faculty, and
subtract a vote which may have been anti—Cleveland,
a Kappa Beta who couldn’t make his first meeting,
and you have what suddenly becomes not only a (lis—
gustingly closed political front, but also a travesty at"
student interest.

'STB now represents 25% of the Council but \Ve’rr-
sure that their opinions do not represent 25% of the
student body. Unfortunately they were elected by tin-
students, most of whom had no idea they were helping

 

 

Musical llote

At one time early in the academic year
we expressed our personal appreciation
for the carillon. At the time it seemed a
warm touch to what many considered a

'cold. cold, campus.

Today the opposite is true; when you
hear the chimes it becomes all too ob-
vious that the chimes are something
that nobody cares about enoughtochange
the inappropriate tapes.

It seems obvious to us, hearing the
6:00 a.m. chimes chiming “Away in a
Manger’ at 6:20 p.m. on April 27, that
no one in any position has bothered to
even think about them. Consequently
they become annoying, ratherthan pleas-
in .

imusingly enough the same old tapes
we have been hearing for the last four
months must be some sort of demon-
strator models of occasional songs. Not
only must we test for tones of the tapes,
but apparently for their longevity. also.

Frankly we’re sick of‘Auld Lang Syne’.
'Away in a Manger,’ and “When Irish
Eyes Are Smiling’—-~it’s May, spring
cleaning should have been done in April.
Get the bats out of the belfry.

logged out

Everybody’s tagged out. The esprit de
corps of the campus seems to be ex—
haustion. There’s so much to do but
there’s no energy to do it. We wanted
to see ‘Brecht on Brecht’ but we had

papers to do. We plannedtodo the papers
but the sun was shining. Oh the warm
bask of somnolence.

Everyone echoes these cries; every-

one has headaches for their joie de

vivre. It seems no one has had a chance
to redeem themselves from the first
half of the semester. As a matter of
fact many kids are still redeeming them-
selves from mid-semesters which their
professors didn’t get around to giving
until now.

This happens every year, but this
year it’s worse, and the whole villain
and scapegoat is the sting! Easter vaca—
tion. Actually it wasof an Easter recess.
Nine out of ten sociological studies have
proved that students pace themselves
far beyond capacity before vacations,ex-
pecting to recoup over the break.

The problem seems to be that this
University deems it necessary to have
a longer academic year than any other
school going. Apparently everyone thinks
having a load of exhausted uninterested
students in class for an extra week is
better than the privilege of a week of
free time (for independent study natur-
ally).

We would like to see the Committee
on Undergraduate Education (which will
be working throughout the summer and
will hopefully be working on some radi—
cally needed changes in the undergrad-
uate education format) seriously con-
sider this problem. And believe us it is
a problem, ask the student next to you—
if he’s not asleep!

 

 

\ liver lhe counter Intelligence

STB to run the school. It may partly be the fault of
students who were uninformed, or partly the fault of
those who were uninformed but did not vote. But. he
is the case in most full scale power drives it is hard
to pinpoint exactly what went wrong. and where.

For the time being we have STB. and we are not
happy. Some will juxtapose the argument that if tin-y
weren’t the best people they wouldn’t be elected. l‘n—
fortunately this doesn’t hold true; it is not law. We
can offer that we, as individuals and an organization
do not have the unswerving faith in the character and
competence of STB. Others are just as competent

For the time being we have STB. Irrevocable for
now, but not forever. We would like to see a concen-
trated student effort to see the forces of STB lessened;
we do not want, nor do we sanction a 25% power con-
centration. Begin now. We hope by this time next you r
to see a judicial distribution of power. A large pa rt of
it depends on student interest and determination and
we hope to see it. Get with it.

be the most effective political ’

duos, such as Ivan and Sylvia, have
come Jim and Jean. Unlike their
predecessors they depend on a broad
and varied electronic backup.

Jim and Jean have been together
for quite awhile. They went to Ohio
State for three years where Jim
roomed with Phil Ochs. All three
quit and headed to the Village where
they remained together until Jim
and Jean were married. Ochs moved
out and proceeded to become one of
the most popular singer-writers in
contemporary folk music.

The influence of Phil Ochsls very
evident on their first album for
Verve/Folkways entitled “Jim and
Jean Changes” (ftsuSOol). Ochs is
present from his liner notes to his
songs “Changes,” “Flower Lady,”
and "Crucificnilon," which 'stand
out as the best numbers of the
record.

"Changes" is the tune I liked
immediately. The harmony of Jim

here the credit goes to Ochs, al-
though the interpretation by these
two singers is nothing short of 132-.—

Both sing solo, andhere Jim’s
'lower range voice comes through ill
the poignant love ballad “Grand
Hotel”. Jean’s soprano does Ind
fare as well on “One Sane Thing."
Her voice lacks power and needs
a richer background or another
voice accompaniment in order in
make contrast.

They also include an Eric An—
derson tune, "Tonight INeed Your

“1 can resist everything
but temptation.”
---American Proverb

Little by little, through a corn-
blnation of apathy, ineptness, and
ignorance, one of the most impor-
tant institutions in student govern-
ment has decayed into almost non-
exisrence.

i am speaking of what is laugh-
ingly now called Election Commis-
slun. “In the old days" this group
consisted of a group of non-politi-
cally aligned but trusted people
who took charge of every election
to insure honesty.

lit present, we have only an Elec-
tion Commissioner, a member of
Central Council, who every now and
then may have a 115! of who is run-
ning. The ballots are in the hands
of the Student Association secre-
tary, who also oversees much of
the actual voting.

Before and during voting, thebai-
lois remain on the table in the Stu-
dent Association office, not exactly

elections. However, the contrary
is true. In last week’s elections,
four people on the ballot did not
have the 2.0 requisite to running for
public office, and one other was not
even a memler of Student Associa-
tion.

Although these names were
crossed off some of the ballots, it
was admitted at Thursday's Central
Council meeting that many people
voted wuh these names on the bal-
lot. Also brought out at the meeting
was that the people handlingthe bal-
lots were members ofCentral Couli-
cil, again not exactlypoiitically non-
aligned.

Under any rational set of rules
these elections would have been in-
validated, It is to the shame of this
school that they were not. I wonder
what New York Democrats would
have said if Governor Rockefeller
was in charge of voting in last No-
vember's election?

I am not suggesting thatthere was
dishonesty involved in last week's
elections. I am saying that this
school has not seen an election in

what [would call politically neutral over a year that would nor have

grounds. Anyone to

no can can a key been disallowed for one reason or

to the office or anyone who has a another by a working Election Com-

-icey to the office, I
abonl 50 or more people, the
myself, may obtain access to

 
   
  

lots.
Probably there would not be as’l‘his

It

 

young as the Vietnam referendum.
These suspicions erroneously arose
because the votes were counted by
someone with a strong stand on the
War.

A working Election Commission
which would eliminate erroneous
ballots which SllOULD invalidate
an election as we witnessed last
week. This election STILL should
be disallowed, but I doubt that Cen-
tral Council will disallow their own
election. However, it should not hap-
pen again.

Contrary to what has gone on in
the past three years, we need neu-
tral Election Commissioner who is
not on Central Council, with a staff
who also are not on Central Coun-
cil, who will assure that voilngtukes
place in a neutral place, and that
there is not the slightest chance of
tampering with the ballots, he also
would not endorse candidates ashus
been done by some Commissioners.

Again 1 question, would you like
to see Lyndon Johnson count the
voles in the 1068 Presidential elec- .
lions? Why do we allow Student
Association Office to take care of
our ballots?

it is the responsibility of the new
Central Council to immediately set
up a newprocedure for voting. There
is no more important duty awaiting
them. i, and i hope many others
will be watching their actions care
fully. i hope that they are worthy 0
"9,0: renew.”

Conclusion on Jim and Jean” l

and Jean's very fine voices excels
and the musical background is as
lively and catchy ns Ochs’ lyrics.
“Flower Lady” has to be the most
appealing number on the record;
melodic, flowing and filled \v.rh ro-
mantic sentiment. "Crucification,"
on the other hand, grows on you
and eventually comes out as their
best selection. The background is

think I'll leave it to Phil (H'lm
