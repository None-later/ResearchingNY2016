Charles Haden, "the man with
the beautiful hands,” will be
accompanying the avant-garde
groups both Saturday and Sun-
day. Very little can be said
about Charlie. What could be
said was said by “Newsweek”
in its February iazz column.

 

The highlight of the entire festival will be the two sets of the
Thai Jones-Mel Lewis Orchestra. The band is, the best that
New York's "Village Vanguard" has to offer right now.

 

Nick Brignola will be the tri-
clties representative to the
festival. Nick has played with
Woody Herman and has been
fronting his own groups for
many years now. He is consid-
ered to be one of the best bari-
tone saxophone players ln the
country today.

Pepper Adams as well as playing with the Thad Jones—Mel
Lewis Orchestra, will be playing a baritone sax duet with
Nick Brignolo. This duet is guaranteed to be most interesting
music. The idea of combining two baritones for a |au combo
is a completely new concept.

What can be said of Muddy Waters? He is absolutely beauti-
ful and will be playing at each one of the four concerts. P.5.
He loves audiences.

Without a doubt. Kenn Iurreil is one of the top three less
guitarists in the worl today. The things he did with Billy
Gillespie at Newport ’66 will long be remembered. Now he
comes to the University...without Diary.

“The Jon Artist at I962," Ted.Curson will be playing with
Niall Brignola and Dick Berk, doing his best to add his knowl-
edge of loss to the education you will be getting on Festival
