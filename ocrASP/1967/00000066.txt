[endings in ilauneli Fri. 'iiuun,
iipstatt’s First Major Happenin

“Lendings.” which will
happen Friday at noon, has
been described by the Con-.
temporary Council On the
Arts as “the first major
happening to be staged in
northern New York.”

The brainchild of Dr. Thompson
Littlefield of the University's Eng-
lish department, Landings is pre- V
sently being worked on by around
one hundred students and faculty.

Littiefield received a call from
the Contemporary Council on the
Arts offering to secure CBS cov-
erage of the happening last week.
Littlefield, however, turned down
the offer because he didn’t want to
impose "that kind of atmosphere
on Landings.”

Although portions of Landings has
been planned in advance and already
‘have students working on them,
Littlefield stressed that anyone may

.partlclpate in Landings.

Unique Happening

This makes Lendings unique
among the happenings which will
happen on campus this weekend,
because Landings will involve ac-
tive, rather than passive, student
action and will in no way be simply
a spectator sport.

The purpose of student partici-
pation in Landings is that through
action, the actors, in acting apart
become themselves; this is opposed
to other happenings in which the
actors become the part they are

1322 Festival To Encamna‘SS

1', Jazz, Art ‘

By now most students at the Uni-.

varsity are aware of the fact that
two happenings will be presented
during this year’s "Spring Jazz
Festival.”
' It seems only a very few of the
students know, or even have any
idea of what the happenings are-
about, due to the fact that most of
the Festival’s publicity has neces-
sarily emphasized the purely mus-
ical performances.

The happenings, including a jazz
happening Saturday afternoon and an
art projection happening Sun. night,
will be part of the festival in the
hope that the audience, while being
entertained, will also be able to
reach a greater rapport with the
musicians on stage.

In other words, the happenings
should help both audience and must-
cians to communicate more easily
with each other.

Ultimate Goal

While communication is the ulti-
mate goai of every jazz musician,
empathy with an audience does not
always occur with his audience.
When this rapport does not exist,
it may be because the musicians.
and audience aren’t reacting to the
same emotion. For example, when
a novice listens to jazz, he may
be interested in watching the musi-
cian’s facial expression, he may
. become involved with the opaque,

Happening Compared

The Rev. Herb Hodgson, chaplain
at RPI, who is coordinating the
event, compared a feature 'of Pi-
casso’s “Guernica” to a happening.
Suppose one were to study a small
segment of this enormous mural
while 96% of the canvas was cov-
ered by a curtain; the observer’s
attention would probably be focused
upon the exposed portion of the
painting, yet think of the tremen-
dous effect the painting would have
if suddenly the curtain was drawn
back and the observer was con-
fronted with the entire work.

The result would be similar to
the effect of the happening. Because
of the complexity of the experience,.
the audiences will be possessed.

The Sunday evening "projection
art" happening will be more specific
in its content. Former professional
artist turned flutist, Jeremy Steig
and his quintet will provide a must-
cal backgrouiid while, with the aid
of an overhead projector, Jeremy
does a painting which inspired and
was inspired by the music. Jeremy
Steig, who incidently, plays an elec-
tric flute similar to the one used in

Gentle ThursdayTo Declare
Nothing’s Wrong. With Fun-

The PAPER, 9. weekly underground newspaper at

(where a Gentle Thursday

was held last month), called Gentle Thursday, “The
celebration of our belief that there is nothing wrong

Ll HINDI” “Itchy. It you

with fun.” In a recent edi—
torial PAPER editors said.
“We would like to be able
to call a one-day morator-
ium on the Vietnam war
and automobile accidents

and business transactions and heart
attacks and boring classes, but we
simply do not have the power to do
so. We can therefore only act as
though we did."

They asked, “What would you do
if such a moratorium were called?"

Gentle Time Out
We second the question. Gentle
Thursday will give everyone a
chance to answer in his own per-
sonal way. We can offer some sug-

' gestions: Smile, hand out daffodils,

fly a kite, siin on the grass, read,
even write some poetry, hum to-

Play the Mamas and Papas out

mate's bed. Decorate your walls.
Take a walk by the lake. Have a
picnic on the quad. Dance on the
academic podium. Say hello to a
stranger.

Give and accept and don’t won-
der why.

The first Gentle Thursday was
celebrated in Austin, Texas. Another
underground newspaper, the RAG,

proposed the idea there. The edl—.

tors wrote, “if this Gentle Thurs-
day is successful, maybe we will
have another Gentle Thursday, and
then a whole week of Gentle Thurs-
days, and then awhole year ofGentle
Thursdays. AND THAT'S Tl-lE REV-
OLUTION."

A Peaceful Revolution

A revolution of love and happi-
ness and sunshine. A peaceful, gentle
revolution that will enable people
to celebrate people-ness.

No specific group or organization
is sponsoring Gentle Thursday.
Which leaves it open to universal

sponsorship. It‘s everybody’s day. .

Gentle Thursday letters have been
sent to local newspapers anti radio
stations. Gary Woods, from WTRY,
said he will come (“I will wear my
shoes, however.”) and bring his
tape recorder. From all indications
there will be plenty for him to re-
port.

Although most of the Gentle
Thursday action is expected to be
spontaneous, a few bands have of-
fered to plug in their instruments
anywhere there is electricity, and
join in the celebration.

Play A Kozoo

We suspect there will he dozens
of miscellaneous kazoos and guitars
and tambourinas, and who knows,
maybe ovon some homemade drums
and musical combs. Why not?

We can only give suggestions about
what to do to celebrate Gentle Thurs-

“New York's happiest musical,”
the publicity calls it, and in all
probability it is. It’s certainly the
longest-running show the Big City
has ever seen, a fact many people
are unaware of, since it is housed
in the Sullivan Street Theatre, an
off-Broadway house. But the show
itself is undeniably one of America’s
most successsful shows, both cri-
tically and popularly. The show?
“The Fantasticks," by Tom Jones
and Harvey Schmidt.

First produced in 1961 by Lore
Noto, "The Fantasticks" met with
immediate success - and the rea-
sons why are obvious to even the
casual observer. No other contem-
porary theatre piece is so frankly,
sentimental or falry-tae-ish, - or
can afford to be. No other formula
would have allowed the authors to
put across thei message in quite
so meaningful a manner. The frank
use made of emotion in the play is
to some appallineg maudlin and
basically deplorable; but to the mind
not ashamed of things like love, "The
Fantasticks" emerges as arestate-
ment of the more worthwhile and
essential elements in life.

The plot line is simple: boy meets
girl, boy loves girls. Fathers de-
sire to further marriage, pretend
opposition, arrange an abduction for
the boy to foil. Happiness - which
then begins to wear thin.

The songs are some of the most
memorable in show business, and
are hiin on the list of all-time unl-
varsal favorites. “Soon It's Gonna
Rain’,’ and "Try To Remember"
need no comment from anyone. Other
of the show’s songs which are less
well-known but equally monng are
“They Were You” and "Soliloquy".
And then there are the hilarious
songs of the fathers - “Plant a
Radish," and "Never Say No."

Those who have never seen this
delight are in luck; the SI" noctady

‘Ulysses’ Not To Be Missed,

Opens Cinema

by Lucius Barre

Whether or not you have read
James Joyce's "Ulysses," you are
in for a distinct treat in seeing the
Joseph Strlck film interpretation
opening tonight at the Strand Thea-
tre for a limited three day engage-
maul.

"Ulysses," as a novel first pub-
lished in 1014, was a great issue
in the development of twentiethcen.
tury literature. Now, on film, Mr.
Strick's direction has set a mile-
stone iu the growth of the motion
picture industry.

Following the original text to the
letter, the action in cinematography
brings forth all of the emotion and
imagery that was Joyce. Opening
new thresholds of realism in the
cinema, the novelty of word usage
and candid action is often stunning.

However, in the mood created,
the rowdy college barroom songs,

the trip through the street ofbroth- .

Thresholds

cis, and the closing scene of Molly
describing her first love are not
distastefully vulgar but rather tact-
fully authentic. A masterful film of
tremendous scope and insight,
“Ulysses” is not to be missed.

Campus Center

Civic Theatre is presenting it all
this week. What would be even more
ideal would be the success of a
movement now afoot among the SUT
student personnel to make “The
Fantasticks" one of SUT’s four
major productions of the 1907-68
season. That the show is ideal for
university theatre is obvious; all
that remains now is for the thea-
tre’s artistic directors to take ac-
tion.

will open tonight with the perfor-
mance at 8 p.m. Tickets are avail-
able at the theatre and there will be
no reserve seats. "

"Clearing" is the story of a
woman who returns to the place of
her childhood and is accosted by
three girls, one nine or ten years
old, the second about seventeen,
and the third twenty-five.,All cry
to her to “take care of us.” ..

in the succeeding action the girls
played by Nancy Fries, Jacqueline
Berger, and Anne Murray respec-
tively, parody scenes from Vir-
ginia’s (Paula Michaels) life, both
past and present. By this, they hope
to remind and show her what she
has become.

But she refuses to accept her-
seii‘ or anyone else because all
are the “ordinary” which she can-
not love. For her it must be per-
fection or nothing.

Barney (Edward Schwartz), Vir-
ginia’s father, provides color as the
alcoholic golfer, and in dialogue
with Virginia also points up her
intolerance of the humanness in
people. “You only ask for help to
show my inadequacy," he cries.

But the girls will not give up and
leave her alone; she WILL betaught
to accept, even to love. “Driven
half-mad," she tries to push them
away but they reply, “YOU are
nothing without us.”

When, in desperate defiance, she
throws away the pills which the
girls have given her to destroy
herself, they deem her ready to

leluuche Film lie-eds iiu Praises,

lias Received Numerous Awards

by Douglas Rothgoh

One would be inclined to think that Claue Lelouche’s
“A Man and a Woman” would have no need of critics
to sing its praises. The winner of the Grand Prix at
Cannes. winner of the Golden Globe Award and two
Oscars (for what they are worth), its laurels would
seem to speak well enough for it.

But as with most critics,
and this one, the tempta-
tion to spill out superla-
tives on a film as lovely
as this is at times over—
whelming; .and certainly,
in a case like this, no
praise could be too ex—
travagant.

The French seem to have a way
with color camera that few others
can even hope to match (The obvious
exception is the Italian, Antonloni,
whose command of the nuances of
color are beyond reproach in "Red
Desert" and "Blow-Up").

Color Used

In Jacques Demy‘s “The Um-
brellas of Cherbourg” and now in
Lelouche's film, color is used to
the fullest, and with startling ef-
fect. Indeed, Lelouch even goes a
step farther, combining in the same
film color, sepia and him-k and white
photography.

In each case he uses the appro-
priate kind of film to fit the mood
he wishes to uchleve—~beautiful soft-
focus color for idyllic scenes byihe
docks and white beach; sharp color
for daylight scenes of racing-cars;
sepia or black and white for night
shots.

Whether or not the technique is
original with Lelouche, i am not
sure. But whether it is or not, he
makes use of it brilliantly, in many
places rivalling the poetic beauty
of Antonionl. I

Story-Simple Tale
The story itself, a simple tale of
a widowed racing car driver and
widowed script-girl coming together
out of loneliness and mutual need,
is well handled and beautifully “ﬂu.

and Anouk Aimee.

means rather than dialogue -- ,a
pleasant change of pace from those
long-winded apics-of-the-lntellect
that talk themselves to death.

A good deal of the film’s beauty
is in its naturalness, in the almost
candid-camera quality of the inti-
mate scenas between the lovers and
in the realistic, documentary qual-
ity of the racing sequences.

As we have come to expect from
the Albany cinemas, “A Man and a
Woman" is not now and may never
be, in this cultural “red desert.”
But inasmuch as the film is simply
too good to miss, you would do well
to go out and look for it.

Alien To Perform

Concert Friday

Dr. Robert D. Allen, chairman of
the Biology Department and cellist,
will perform this Friday, 1:30 in
the Ballroom of the Campus Center.
Accompanying him will be Patricia
Grignet, obolst and Findlay Cock-
reil, pianist, members of the Music

Sonata in E Minor for cello and
piano. Allen has studied cello at
Tanglewood with the Boston Sym-
phony’s first cellist and has re-
cently performed a concerto with

Cockreil commented that "Dr.
Allen is a real ‘find’ and we hope
to perform with him often." The
