Referendum Important

To the Editor:

in their editorial ‘State of Con-
fusion' (April 28), the ASP answers
a criticism of their coverage of the
Vietnam referendum by criticizing
the wording of the referendum itself.
The referendum, they say, was so
"poorly worded so as to cause con-
fusion in interpretation,” and there'-
fore, limiting the size of the story
accompanying the referendum re-
suits.”

But does this answer the senti-
ment of the letter of Misses Pres-
cott and Trifilio? The ASP actually
did minimize the results of avitally
important issue by treating it as
something only minimally related
to the student body.

At other universities, similar ref-
erendums have been a focal point on
the Vietnam issue. One role of the
student paper has been to arouse

~ opinion, which has resulted not only
in a greater participation in the

. voting, but also national press cov-
erage of the results.

if a student'newspaper is to at-
tain a significant place in a college
community, it must do more than
report news as received. The paper
has a responsibility to clarify issues
and to take stands on issues that
basically affect the lives of the stu-
dent body.

The editorial asks, "What effect
will the results of the poorly worded
misrepresented Vietnam referen-
dum have on the war?" lfone SUNYA
student dies in Vietnam next year,
some might feel that the Vietnam
referendum was of infinite more
importance than the number of foot-
ball victories SUNYA could achieve
in a century.

'Run With lt'

To the Editor:

In the editorial of April 28, en-
titled 'State of Confusion’, you ask
the following questions: “What ef-
fect will the results of the poorly
worded misrepresented Vietnam
referendum have on the War? What
effect should the football poll have
on influencing the initiation of foot-
ball of this campus?" Then you note
that "the answers to these questions
should indicate someting (sic)'about
their ‘value’."

What do you think about the pos-
sibility of a detailed analysis of
stiuient opinion on the issue of
American involvement in Vietnam?
in your opinion, what inﬂuence
should a comprehensive referendum
on Vietnam have on our policy-malt-
ers in Washington? in the mortal
words of Knots Rockne: “it’s your
ball, baby. run with iti"

David Fractenberg
Department of Speech

and detailed referendum, and that it
should have a positiVe effect on the
legislators’ actions.

However, we felt, and still do
feel, that this referendum did not
meet this criteria. It was designed
to back up the action of the Univer-
sity delegates to the Cornell Con-
ference, and not as a detailed state-
ment of student opinion at the Uni-
versity designed to influence legis-
lators.

The idea seems to bethat because
we did not support a specific side
of- the referendum in an editorial
comment that we have no feelings
on the matter. In fact we deplore
war and slaughter and feel the im-
pact of the war on the lives of
American citizens everywhere.

The statement was in no means

flippant attempt ‘to equate the
Vietnam War with the introduction
on football on tilts campus, nor was
it an attempt to make the relative
merits of a poll of public opinion
on policy makers.

Job Deplored , _ '

To the Editors:

Your editorial of April 25 con-
cerning the lack' of an honors con-
vocation this year was all right as
far as it went. l do~feel, however,
that the editorial was not lair to
Signum Laudis.

The implication in the article is
that Signum Laudis carried the ma-
jor responsibility for the decision
not to hold an Honors Convocation.
As i mentioned to you on the tele-
phone mnday, April 23, the final
decision was made by President
Collins on recommendation from
Dean Deeringer.

The time involved was definitely
a factor because of the necessity
of printing a program’pand secur-
ing facilities and a' speaker, but,
as you were made aware, the non-
activation by the faculty of the Fac-
ulty Committee on Honors and
Awards was also a great factor.

1 suggested on Sunday that you
contact Dean Derringer, as he is

that was presented to us earlier
this semester, except to comment
that we foretold the events that oc-
curred last week.

i also have been disgusted and
frustrated with the continuance of
extreme apathy and acquiescence
pertaining to the way our student
government is functioning. The
harsh truth is that we are all to
blame: the student is so worried
about that “make” for next Satur-
day night and falls to vote; the stu-
dent leader who was originally en-
thusiastic, but now, is caught up
with personality conflicts that lead
to frustration and despair; and the
news media in its absence to pro-
test or inform when most needed.

These combinations of anomalies
are what give impetus to the for-
mation of power cliques in politics.
in essence the representative is as
responsible as the people whom he
represents.

.After our abortive attempt to
shock the people from their shelter
of apathy an old friend of mine
commented in a publication that we
were ‘fools’ for even considering
such a project. He believed that our
campaign then, “was so bathed in
its own self-righteousness that its
zealots failed to perceive the am-
bivalences around them.” Now i
feel this is also true. ~.

Maybe there are some positive
alternatives to alleviate this con-
dition. One sure cure is to have an
impartial election commission to
observe all aspects of the election
without fear of covert pressure by
any group. This proved successful
three years ago. But the real prob-
lem lies in the studentsthemselves.

Only when the attitude of students
change will the government change.
When apathy remains supreme, the
government will remain impersonal
and unresponsive to their desires.

my opening quote, who can we put
the blame on as to who set up the
situation as it exists?

Well, once upon a time, when
things were still a little straight,
an Election Commissioner was ap-
pointed who was the first one ever
to endorse candidates. Who? Wil-
liam Cleveland.

Later on, another Commissioner
was appointed who did a fairly good
job of running things. She quit,
however, and someone appointed
another Commissioner named Tom
Merlo. '

Who was it who appointed this
man and allowed him to retain of—
fice? William Cleveland.

We have had enough, Mr. Presi-
dent. We want election reform now,
not when we force you to nominate
someone worthwhile as Commis—
sioner. We were willing to work
alongwith you, but when you refused
to treat us its honorably as we
treated you, by lying to our faces
when you knew we could check up,
you deserve no better than you get.

But, that, is unimportant. We are
submitting this referral to Supreme
Court. We hope that they act a little
better than last year's group did
and take immediate action. We want
election reform and a complete in-
vestigation right away. We'll lx'
watching.

Former Pres. 0f Costa Rica
Speaks On Economic Aid

Dr. Jose Figueres, former pres-
ident of Costa Rica, stated in a
lecture given this past week at the
University that the rich countries
of the world must work together and
help to close the economic gap be-
tween them and the poor countries.

Figueres called Latin America
the least difficult continent to de-
velop today. To support this state-
ment he pointed to similarities of
North American and European cul-
tures to the culture of South Amer-

Although Figueres recognized the
internal problems of Latin America
he devoted the major part of his
lecture to the area's external prob-
lems. That is, the relation of the
rich countries of the .world,to the
poor countries of Latin America.

The former president advocated
a plan put forth by the World Con-
ference on Trade. This plan calls

for the pooling of 2% of all rich .

countries’ GNP to be used to aid
underdeveloped nations.

Two percent of the United States'
GNP, according to Figueres is
about fourteen billion dollars. ’The
Costa Rican statesmanfurther noted
that the United States spends about
three billion dollars on foreign aid
and seventy-five billion on arma-
ments this year.

it was pointed out by Figueres
that the advances of the rich na-
tions hinders the advancement of
‘the poorer nations. mghly de_
veloped advertising has caused the
desire of the Latins to consume
more than they can pay for. To pay
for these luxuries the Latin Amer-
icans sell more coffee. When he
sells more coffee he increases the
volume on the market and conse—
quently the price goes down. When
the price decreases he must pro-
duce more coffee and begin the
cycle again.

the main issue of discussion at the
President’s: Confprence Manley.

v Boy Adell, ﬁcently elected to LAAC

from the Colonial mad, presenteda
letter to the President and the Al-
bany’ Rodent Press which hadalso

‘ been sent-to Alice Hastings of the

library. ‘ »

The letter follows: .
Dear Miss Hastings,

i feel that,there is a definite need
for keeping the doors of the library

topen to the student body for a

longer period of time than is pre-
sently in effect. The reasons are as
follows: (1) within the month new
women's hours will be initiated;
(2) study spaces presently provided
by the dorm study halls and cafe-
terias are inadequate and (3) the
immense space in the library that
is so conducive to studying is being
wasted.

i appreciate the problems you have
to face concerning this matter, but
would hope that you give due con-
sideration to the following proposals
to alleviate some of the more ob-
vious conflicts: .

l) The library shall remain open
from it a.m. to 12 a.m. Sunday
through Thursday. Hours for Fri-
day and Saturday shall remain as
they stand at present.

2) Books shall not be checked out
after the usual hour of 10 p.m. All
other extra services (for example:
reference librarians, music rooms,
and etc.) shall also close at the hour
of to p.m.

3) Cleaning and maintenance shall
maintain their usual work hoursand
duties. Jobs involving noise (for ex-
ample: vacuuming) shallproceed at
the student's inconvenience.

4) One campus security and one
student worker shall be all that is
needed to maintain security for the
library and shall be stationed at the
exist. No student workers will be
needed to function at the information
centers since this canbeconsidered
an extra function or extra service.

Thank you very much for your
