season so far. have won three out theirlast'fo'ur and.
 to have finally gained momentum that they
lacked "in the beginning of‘ the season. Their I-hittingf
has come around and are playing good bail in the
field besides getting some fine pitching. especially
from Gas Galka and Tom Egelston. _

At the time of this writing, Coach BobBurlingame’s
nine have eight games remaining. We feel that they
can take five of these games to wind up .500 for the
year, which is excellent for a team that has only one
senior and a handful of juniors. ' -

There isn’t enough that we can say about the tennis
squad. The netmen have won four of their first five,
all of which were away matches. Wednesday they
faced RPI in the first of four straight home contests
with the other three coming against Central Con-
necticut, Oneonta, and New Paltz, the last being and
8 pm. contest under the lights on May 17. We feel
that in these 'and in the last match at Farleigh-
Dickinson, the netmen should certainly win at least
four of the five with a possible outside chance for a
sweep of a 11.

The linkers have not been playing up to their
abilities. In their first four matches. they have won
one. lost two, and tied one. Scores have not been up
to par, and two or three of the members are hardly
shooting as well as they should be. We admit that the
bad weather has hampered the team’s practicing
somewhat, but now that this is an unplausible excuse,
scores should be going down. We hope that this factor
in addition to a little harder work on the part of a
couple of others can produce a .500 season. It will
be interesting to watch the results.

AMIA softball has progressed smoothly through the
first half of the season. Except for rescheduled
rained out games, Commissioner Jim Wingate has
encountered no problems with regard to umpires.
players, or teams. We feel that the great deal of
success is due largely to the fine spirit of both the
teams and spectators.

In League I, APA has still yet to be beaten and
will be tough in its remaining games. Tomorrow at
2:00 they face the Hooper Athletic Club, who suffered
their only loss of the season to the men from Clinton
Hall, 5-4. The Hoopers will be out to seek revenge
and the game promises to be one of the finest of the
year.

The Chuck Schaffer captained Comets look like the
team to beat in League II. They haven’tcome close to

losing and should have no trouble winning their divi—.

sion.

Well folks. that’s the way things shape up as the
spring sports scene heads into the last three weeks
of play. Any comments?

Softball action around the AMIA
circuits finally seems to be in full
swing after mother nature did her
best in making a complete. mess
out of the tentative schedules. The
way things look now if Leagues ii
and iii are to complete their sea-
sons all players should begin now
in registering for SUNYA’s Sum-
mer Session.

League Ill has three undefeated
teams: the Flying Jabones (of 64-11
fame), APA which made its season
‘debut Wednesday with a slick-field-
ing 13-4 victory over Hamilton Hall
and TXO, which hasn’t played yet.

League II (A) has defending
champs, the Comets leading the
pack with a 3-0 record. BPS has
won its only start. Over in the B
division a strong Potter team is
on top with a 3-0 mark.

Games last week in League i
saw STB fall by the wayside to
two of the top teams, Potter (A)
and APA.

Potter A took advantage of wild-
ness by the STD pitcher on their
way to a 17-3 romp. The Potter
hitting attack was highlighted by
home runs by two ifiis lesser known
sticks. Jim Curley, better known
for his quarterback scampers,
scampered around the bases for a
four-bagger as did Tony Glozer,
sit-varsity netman. Dan Crippen was
once agaih very strong in hurling
for the EEPs. He gave up oniythree
hits, one of them being a home run
by Bob Delena. A significant note
about this game is that the llooper
Athletic Club failed to provide an

Soccer, Baseball Star

by Hank Rabinowiiz

Last June Albany’s var-
sity baseball teambeat RPI
for the first time. This
past Friday we gained our
second victory. In each

contest, Tom Egelston was '

the winning pitcher.

Tom is a junior graduated from
Albany Academy. During his high
school career he was an eight iet-'
terman, competing in swimming,
baseball, and soccer. Notably, he
was an All-Albany selection in soc-
cer twice.

Undaieaiud His Senior Year
Up until the eighth grade, Tom had
only pitched a total of two innings.
However, during the next few years
pitching gradually became his rogu-
lar position. Asasenior be compiled
an outstanding record in varsity and

American Legion action, with a 6-0
slate on each team. Duringthe sum-
mer he played inthe Twilight League
under Coach Burlingame. .3
Since coming to Albany, Tom ha‘
been a member of two varsity teams.
For the last three years he has
played fullback for the soccer team,
and pitched for our baseball squad.

. Adds A Fastball and Curve

Before this year Egelsion was
primarily a screwballpitcher. How-
ever, this year he has been able to
employ his fastball and curve with
good results. lie believes that if he
has his control, it's just a matter of
throwing the "right pitch at the right
time."

in his last outing against RPl, he
had good control, striking out m)
batters. Ho pointed out that a con-
tributing factor in the team’s vic-
tory was the excellent support he
received from the players. The club
fielded woll, making a high number
of good pinys.

Central council
lines Nothing,

Per lisuai State

Central Council decided to repri-
mand the administration and faculty
of the University after the refusal
of the new proposed dormitory policy
by President Tom Collins. The plan
presented by the students called for
the end of sex discrimination in
student housing.

Student Association President
Boss Humpland declared that the
University President was acting in
a senile Victorian fashion and should
be replaced by someone young,deb-
onair and handsome like himself.
In reply to this statement Sue Vali-
hop, leader of the women's rights
movement on the campus, demanded
that only women be asked to take
over Collin's job and not man.

To force the administration to
comply to their wishes Central
Council decided to withdraw their
money and membership from the
Faculty-Student Association. Davis
Goings noted that this measure may
put a minor crimp in the vast fi-
nances of the administrations runned

SA.

Ted Toolman protested against
the extreme actions taken by the
council. Toolman was banned from
the rest of the meeting. The Politi-
cal and Social Positions Committee
(PSP) was asked to organize mass
demonstrations opposing the re-
fusal of the new dorm policy.

Humpland stated that as far as
he was concerned the students could
live in dorms without discrimina-
tion of the sexes. The council broke
into politely horrid displays of af-
fection. Members from Religious
Affairs and Pan Hellianic Council
walked out, one in protest, the
other in complete accord.

Humpland further announced that
if anyone was locked out of the
dormitory of his choice he could
use the undiscriminating pond area
and a blanket for a refuge at night.

Willie Cummore brilliantly ex-
pressed the general feeling of Cen-
tral Council when he said, "i feel
that the student at Albany is mature
enough to act like a responsible
citizen, and there should be no fear
of the student mishandling this new
privilege.”

Now Security Hood
Announced Today

The appointment was announced
today of Martin Borinann as the
new head of the Campus Security
Force. Bormann has long been
recognized as one of the leading
experts in his field.

Although believed missing for
twenty-two years, since the end of
World War [1, it seems that Bor-
mann has been residing inNew York
State for moat of this time. lie has
been working under assumed names
as Dorm Directors in various units
of the State University system.

liormaun achieved most of his
fame as the Number 3 man of Ger-
many's Third Reich under Adolph
llitler. Often he was referred to
as liltlor’s “right hand man."

In exclusive interview with the
ASP, Bormann slated, "i feel that
my extensive experience with run-
ning the SS forces in Germany dur-
ing the War will enable me to con-
tinue on in the tradition that the
Security Force has established,”

“My further experience with 'en-
amiss of the stale' will help me to
solve the current problem of what
to do with the parking violators on
this campus."

“Mainly, however, my experience
as a master of harassment and an-

noyance will prove the Administra-V
tion right in choosing me "as the"

in

best man for this job," ‘ J ‘

Administration Considers

Brainwashin'gilf Students

Grass was the major topic dis-
cussed by President Collins at the
President’s Press Conference on
Monday. Ostensibly, he was refer-
ring to a current campaign being
waged by Vice-President Thorne
and Miss Edsall to keep students
from trampling the newly seeded
areas of the campus.

Collins went into great detail
about a plan that was going into
effect at the insistence of the "con-
tractor." The main purpose of the
campaiin was to instill in the stu-
dents a built-in resistance to grass
by constant exposure to the phrase,
“Keep Off Grass.”

The skepticism to this program
was aptly expressed by one of the
ASP’s representatives, Marty
Smart, who remarked to Collins,
“Ah, come off it, Vanl"

Since the conference, the ASP’s
secret dirt digger upper has been
investigating this situation and we
are ready to announce the results.

We were intrigued by several
aspects of this case. Collins has
been very adamant in his insistence
all year that Vice-President Olsen
was in charge of anything to do with
the physical plant and the grounds.

Why, then, is this program being
run by the Vice-President for Stu-
dent Affairs and the Director of
Residences? It seems that the sub-
ject matter under consideration is
really Grass, not grassi Poi, man,
canibis, the S’l‘Ult‘Fi

 

l ,

By deviously sneaking into the
President’s files, we discovered
that this whole problem is being
sponsored by the CIA and the FBI,
who believe that the indoctrination
and brainwashing campaign now
.being undertaken by the administra-
tion to keep us off grass will some-
how generalize (in traditional Pav-
lovian psychology) to Grass.

Luckily for the student body,Cen-
trai Council has decided to table
discussion on the Keep off Grass
campaign until next week. The en-
tire meeting this week will be taken
up with the conference with Phi
Beta Lambda, the Business Club
which advises Central Council in
financial matters.

At the meeting Central Council
will decide whether to invest the
surplus budget in Zig Zag Cigar-
ette Paper Company, as has been
tradition in recent years.

Graciela Garcia
Writes A Letter

Graciela Garcia, the ASP foster
child, has written another letter to
inform her foster parents of her
progress.

My dear Foster Parents:

I am a big girl now that you can
see from the picture with this.
White dress is wedding gown. Stupid
peace Corp worker tell me that he
teach us all new game. i like this
game for long time.

No longer I, am the skinny girl

you remember from old picture:
i spend your $8.00 of donationllo
buy pretty white dress. American
say that he buy flowers.
' My faintly is well, exoept me. I
am very sick in morning how, but
doctor say that go away soon. My
teacher at the school is telling me
about weddings and the church named
"Virgen de Guadalupe" is where it
will be.

We celebrate wedding when we
find American. Meanwhile i go to
school with my brother and we are
very happy. My father is very happy
also. lie talk all day about one less
mouth to feed. [do not understand,

Graciela Garcia

The farm will be operated for the sole purpose of
raising as many rabbits as possible. As of last Wed-
nesday, over 500 rabbits were being housed.

The farm is located on
the eastern corner of the
Infirmary building, where
easy access is available to
the laboratory facilities.

Living Area Affairs Commission
Farm, as it has been readily nick-
named, was started as an economic
measure soon after University
Council approved the new women’s
hours proposal. “The need was so
drastic," Dr. LLR maintained, “that
the local suppliers could not keep
up with our demand."

“The cost of importing these
rabbits was higher than the ex-
pense of raising our own," Dr.
LLR explained. Dr. LLR went on
to tell us how these rabbits were
used in certain laboratory exper-
ifnenis, bemoanlng the high mor-
tality rate among them.

Type at Experiment

When asked as to the type of ex-
periment the rabbits were used in,
the good doctor‘ giggled a little,
blushed, and offered us a bottle of
cepacol.

The current problem now is that
the rabits do not breed fast enough
for the lnfirmary's purposes. To
alleviate this strain an arrange-
ment has been worked out with the
Biology Department to give the
nurses first dibs on the frogs.

Asked what other measures were
being taken to meet the current
situation, Dr. LLR showed us the
huge supply of penicillin the Infir-
mary has stockpiled to head off
another anticipated crisis.

Early Problem

One of the early problems that
arose was the financial backing of
the Infirmary projects. President
Tom Collins just announced that
the 1950 budget was recently worked
out and Dr. Little Red Riding felt
that she could not wait for the 1067
budget.

This problem was alleviated by a
joint effort of the Tom Sawyer Mo-

tel, the Travelodge and the Thru-
way Moior inn, who felt that they
"owed a vote of thanks to the Uni-
versity."

We asked President Tom Collins
for his opinion of this new develop-
ment. He told us of the Committee
on Rabbits, of the Committee on
Pregnancies, of the Committee on
intercourse, of the Committee on
Residences, of the Student Affairs
Council of Faculty Senate.

' Recommendations

“I have asked Central Council
and Faculty Senate for recommen-
dations for appointment to this com-
mittee, which, when selected, will
work out a proposal as to what my
opinion should be," said Collins.

'Collins continued, “As soon as
the proposal passes all ofthe afore-
mentioned groups it mustberatified
by Central Council, LAAC, all dorm
governments, inter-Fraternity
Council, the Sociology Department,
the Committee to End the War in
Vietnam, Forum of Politics, Com-
munications Council, the Security
Force, Freedom Council, my mother
and the Education Building jani-
tors."

"When this is accomplished, it
will be submitted to the University
Council, and, if approved, 1 will
appeal to the gods, who, through
Minerva, the goddess of wisdom,
will also pass judgment. Assuming
the proposal is still active, a letter
will be sent to all students, parents
and alumni stating my intention to
form an opinion."

Keep Reading

"If, after a three months waiting
period, no more than two protests
are lodged, the proposal will then
become my official opinion. Check
back with me in lo years.”

Faculty-Student Association an-
nounced also that they will start
their own farm where they will
raise sheep for the purpose of ob-
taining lamb skin.
