To the Editor:

1 want to write in and tell youjust
what i think of your lousy rag of a
a. newspaper. First of all you never
 get your stinking pictures with the
if right captions, and even if you do
'1 they are the some pictures that you
ran the week before.

There is absolutely no imagina-
tion in your story writing. All that
you are is an annotated Campus
Clipboard. As if to make it worse,
the stories defy all rules of jour-
nalistic tradition and bear no re-
semblance to the correct usage of
the English language.

The editorials are always inane
and poorly written and are only out;
done in mediocrity by the editorial
cartoons. Dan't you ever make any
effort to get columnists that have
anything to say, or does anyone who
submits something get it printed on
the editorial page?

The sports page is unreadable
while, the Arts page shows all of
the sophistication of a fifth grade
education. in addition, there has not

I been a worthwhile feature spread
since September.
in conclusion, about the only good
thing that we can any aboutthe paper
is that it is not printed during the

origination of the editors and an

of authority that Spring really is here.

THE TRUTH ABOUT

Smarty is a guy you hear a lot
from, but most of you know very
little about him. Now for the first

story of the REAL Marty Smarty.

He has an evil mind but he’s

He once had a car which he called
the Mayﬂower. The name, he says,
is because of all the girls whocame
across in it, That’s closel

On the walls of his apartment he
has large posters of Allen Ginsburg
and the Marx brothers. These re-
place ones oi Batman and Alfred E.
Newman. That should give, you an
idea of his tastes.

He reads Marvel comic books
while he eats every meal (even
breakfast).

His favorite meal is a bowl of

On Referendum

To the Editors:

i am just writing in to say i was
surely pleased to hear how about
well the students there at the State
University of New York unit at Al-
bany reacted to the Vietnam refer-
endum. It certainly does thyself,
and all my buddies down at the
Pentagon a world of good to realize
that somewhere a campus is can
be duped by us." Yesssiree.

it doesn’t matter that the referen-
dum was deceptively written so that
although a student mightnot approve
of the present action in Vietnam
(both North and South of course) he
could still indirectly support it by
voting not to condemn the U.B. for-
mal policy.

Because obviously our formal pol.
icy is not expected to have any
correlation with the actual action
taken. Thus, the student may be
tricked into voting a Dl‘O'l‘lltllal‘

President has asked me to secure
the names of the committee which
drafted the referendum for future
recruitment of Pentagon stain.» .

you printed yesterday. Personally,

meant that referendums of major
political crises were useless as
such, except that this referendum
was not detailed or designed to be
sent to the "policy makersin Wash-
ington." Ilowever, all your readers
seem to have misinterpreted you,
and the whole thing makes you come
out sounding like you are in favor
on a shut-up and do-nothing policy
which frankly suits me and the
Pentagon fine.

Flease place us on your mailing

Council Invalidates Elections

by John Crom in

Central Council suspended its op- a

oration on Gentle Thursday by de-
claring the popular election of its
members and of the members 0
Living Area Affairs Commission in-
valid. This declaration concerns
only the elections of April 24-28,
1967.

The main reason for the invalid-
ation of the elections is that the
elections were not conducted in a
"just and proper” manner as called
in the Student Association Constitu-

tion. The alleged irregularities in
the election were mainly results of
poorly organized method of
screening applicants and of running
the election itself.

Dr. Richard Kendall presented the

1 current opinion when he stated that

“the information presented to him
made him doubt that the” elections
were proper."

There was no time allotted for
the self-nominations to be screened
before the ballots were made up.
When it was found that some of the
persons running were not qualified
the word was sent out to cross their

Cleveland Presents Letter
To Student Association

A letter similar to this was pre-
sented to Central Council members
Thursday night from William Cleve-
land.

Fellow Students,

During the March elections for
class officers and MYSKANlA,1was
studying in the Student Association
office. in the same office in the
closets were the ballots and ballot
boxes for those elections. For a
moment, temptation overtook me
and I found myself at my desk with
a pile of ballots. i started through
the pile marking the ballots for '58
class officers and MYSKANl/i; for-
tunately, as I wrote, the realization
of what I was actually doing came
to me.

i clearly recognized the mistake
which i was about to make and
placed the marked and unmarked
ballots in my desk drawer. In this
action 1 made a value judgment
which i felt at the time and continue
to feel was best for myself and
Student Association--the elections
were never tampered with.

Later that night after i left the
office, Vincen Abramo, the Vice-
President of Central Council, was
looking for some tapc.lnhis search,
he came upon the ballots in mydesk.
The following people were then
alerted that the ballots had been
found: Vice-President Tliorne, Mr.
Brown, Kileen Tracy, and Margaret
dunlap.

Sim-e it was obviously a student
affair, the students had to make the
decision. They decided that since
no Infraction had actually beencom-
milied, that it was in the best inter-
(£911 of Student Association that the
incident be forgotten.

Weeks later, knowledge of the
incident went beyond the original
students. A group of these students
to whom the information spread
have now decided that the incident
should be publicly aired along with
other deficiencies in the election
procedure. Today's ASP carries the
entire siory and requests election
reform. Further, ithas been brought
to my attention that a referral has
been prepared for presentation to
Supreme Court requesting the in-
validation of the Class, MYSKANIA,
and Central Council elections.

i feel quite strongly that asmem-
bars of the student Association, you
deserve to be alerted to the entire
situation. i ran for the presidency
of Central Council because I feel
that my contributions to this Student
Association justified my re-ulec-
tion; I would hope this is increased

1 was elected. The iwgmontnf'myddww, a.

actions is now yours; I hope i have
your support.

i would close with one point---
if toying with temptation is a crime
and justifies the voiding of the
election, then I am guilty and the
elections are void. But, if people
are to be judged on their thought
then l have done nothing wrong and
the elections are valid.

names off the ballots. Some ofthe

people in charge of the elections in

the quads were not informed of the

changes. Consequently some people

were deprived of their vote and

the election was not properly run.’
,.// I.

Also involved in the rationale be-
hind the council's action is the fact
that all the ballots of the election
were not kept in a central and se-
cure place.

Although it was brought uppthe
Council decided not to invalidate
the class elections and MYSKANlA
elections. The main reasons for
this action was that the Council
had no power to act upon this meas-
ure according to the laws ofthe Stu-
dent Association. lt was stated by
Andy Mathias that the moral issues
concerning a person should be left
out of the discussion.

The elections, by act of the Coun-
cil, will be open only to those stu-
dents who nominated themselves
previously and are qualified to run.
The election will not be under the
supervision of Election Committee
but of MYSKANIA of 66-67. Voting
will take place on May to, 11 and 12
from 9 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. in the
Coat Check Room of the Campus
Center. '

Student Leaders To Attend

Lecture 0n Communications

Dr. Donald Donley will lecture
on the area of communications as
it affects group interaction Thurs.,
May 11, at 8:00 p.m. in the Cam-
pus Center Assembly Hall.

sion to the "highly successful"

The purpose of the original work-
shop was to foster leadership
through understanding and to "en-
courage interaction among those
student leaders who attended."

A questionnaire was later sent
out to determine the success of the
workshop and also to determine
areas of interest in preparation for

 

a follow-up session.

Thursday's program he been de-
signed as a result of this question-
naire in order to present aprogram
on communications open to all
newly-elected and experienced cam-
pus leaders.

Donley is a professor in Educa-
tional Administration and executive
director of the Capital Area School
Development Association under the
University's Center for Research
and Field Services.

audience participation and will be
followed by a coffee hour and, In-
