The fact is that the elections are being

Constructive Image

To the Ediiors:
i could not help but take notice
of a public relations release about
Carnival Week which appeared in
the suburban weekly, The Turnpike
Record (and perhaps elsewhere as
well). The release purported to ad-
viso tho communin of this “am.
bitinus" undertaking by the clinical
body.
“Most of the news about college
students these days,” said the Pub-
licity Chairman for Carnival Woek,
“emphasizes sit-ins, protests and
various demonstrations. We want to
prove we can achich constructive
ends, too."

i take cacophon to this and find
tho comparison hotwoon sit-ins and
Carnival Wool: ludicrous. lot it he
said that tho involvumont of the
academic cornmunity in civil rights

non-white community.

Said involvement rcdounds lo the
credit of the academic community
and justifies the existence of the
educational institution as a Vehicle
of truth. i believe it a soriouscrror
to convey to the community (espe-
cially in the suburban captivity,
isolated as it is from the truth of
the Ghetto) such "constructive" im-
ages—4! constructive ls hero con-
strued and even distorted to moan
non-involvement in daily social is-
sues.

Grades Worthless

To lilo Editors:

Perhaps congratulations are in
order for the members of Della
Sigma Pi and the other such people
who made possible the raffling of
an “A” grade. I think we have
come a long way as “educators”
and the "educated" when we so
freely admit the true worlhlsssnoss
of letter grades. This raffle was
just another way to play the game--
the only difference being that it
you more highly selective.

M
Killeen Tracy, Election Commis-

sioner; Vincent Abramo, Vice-
President of Student Association,
and, of course, Cleveland.

Of these, Tracy resigned her of-
fice months ago. Abramo's term
expired andis now out of office.
Now it turns out that Dunlap is
rsigning at the end of the year as
the ASP editor. The only one to
come out of the "incident" un-
scathed is Cleveland, who retains
his post as Student Association
President next year. interesting.

Another interesting anti-climax
to the whole incident was the let-
ters (two actually) which Mr.Cleve-
land has been distributing around
campus. A few of the points in the
letter deserve comment.

Actually, they don’t deserve com-
ment; they deserve answers.

One question that has never been
answered is who was the one who
spent six or seven hours running
off 6000 ballots on the mimeograph
machine so that this “moment of
temptation" could overcome Cleve-
land when he saw them on the table.

if he spent seven hours rilnning
them off himself and then several
hours marking ballots in different
inks and polls, i fall to find the
phrase “moment” adequate to dis-
cuss the period that he was over-
come with temptation.

Another point is that the letter
says that Abramo found lilo ballots
"later that night," giving the im-

presslon that it was before Cleve-
land had a chance to dispose of the
ballots.

However, the ballots were on
Monday night while Mr. Brown tells
us that Cleveland’s original confes-
sion two months ago said that he
marked the ballots Sunday after-
noon. This leavoa a period of over
24 hours until the ballots were dis-
covered, an adequate period of time
for the ballots to be destroyed.

Another question i have Cleveland
is the comment be made in a letter
to Central Council Thursday night.

in it he says that Central Council
members deserve to know of the
situation. before reading it in the
ASP Friday. i wonder why he did
not feel this urgency to tell of his
actions before Central Council
elected their 1967-68 President, as
he promised that he would do?

All of those facts are irrelevant
in the light of the action taken,haw-
over. Cleveland's action was but one
of several infractions we brought
before public scrutiny. i say infrac-
tion because several of us feel that
the possession of ballots by a can-
’diate in an election is an illegal act
in itself, whether or not the boxes
were stuffed.

At any rate , the major purpose be-
hind the publicity was ioobtaln elec-
tion reform, a campaign we were
working on before the facts ofClevc-
land's transgression became kllown
to us. in our referral, the mention
of his action was but one often
items of reasonable doubt thatelec—
tions were "just and proper" as
the SA Constitution says they must
be.

As l’m sure that you know, this
end was achieved with the passage
of our election bill last Thursday
by Central Council, calling for a
new Election Commission. Any fur—
ther action will have to be taken up
by someone with other goals than
my own.

A new tradition was established
last week with the presentation of
the State University Theatre's fi-

productfon out-of-doors on the
s ore of the campus take. "A
Clearing in the Woods,’ at play by
Arthur laurcnts, had a six-night
run - almost; it was, unfortunately,
rahled out on two separate eve-
nings. The setting of the play is a
toy house, and the outdoor scene
lent itself perfectly to the action.

“A Clearing in the Woods" is a
psychological drama concerning the
life of Virginia, an unhappy middle-
agod woman who was portrayed with
her customary elegance and skillby
Paula Michaela. Lanrenis" mes-

ge concerning Virginia's emo-

bnal stresses was brought forth
by three younger girls who repre—
sented different ages in Virginia’s
life.

Nancy Fries as the youngest girl,
.ligee, was cute and appealing, but

accent - and the absence of a bet-
ter understanding of the character -

were distracting. Nora, represen-
tative of the 18-year-old Virginia
was convincingly done by Jackie
Berger as the unpleasant part of
the older woman's make-up. Miss
Berger was completely submerged
in her character and at times was
irrepressibly humorous.

Probably highest praise shouldgo
to Anne Murray, who has come a
long way since Penny. Shedisplayed
a beauty, charm and grace in her
role that were inspiring to see. At
times wicked, at times lovely, she
always combined the two success-
fully.

Ed Schwartz, as Virginia's father,
generally left much to be desired;
he was unable to carry off the rat
he was unable to carry off the age
required of his role. He was aided
neither by his lack of acting abil-
ity nor his horrendous makeup.

and pleasant as a Mad Ave. man,
while both Bill Schaefer and Dave
Golden were adequate.

be Paul Villanl, who was right at
home in the outdoor setting. He

serves much praise. Miss Michaels

fortless realism.

One wishes that more could be
said of the direction of Marty Mann.
While there is a school which holds
that direction which is undetectable
is best, but the feeling is always
present, as with previous Mann
shows, that the play succeeds, not
because of , but rather in spite of
him.

One of the most noteworthy as-
pects of the production was the
technical one. The challenge of out-
door staging must have been great,
but tech director Donnelly carried
it all off, especially the lighting,
with the usual professionalism. Aud-
iences were disappointing - but than,
as a whole, so was the “Clearing.”
