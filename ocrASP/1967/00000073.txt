Sverre Petterssen,

_ Noted Meteorologist

llametilo New Post

Dr. Sverre Petterssen.
a meteorologist from Lon-
don, has been appointed to
the newly created post of
International Professor of
Earth and Atmospheric
Sciences at the University.

Petterssen, who lectured at the

University Jan.
chairman and professor of meteor-
ology at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and at the University of
Chicago. "
He is the former president of the
American Meteorological Society
and former chairman of the Com-
mittee on International Programs
in Atmospheric Sciences of the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences.

Petterssen was a member of the
prominent group of meteorologists
who advised postponement of the
Allies “Operation Overload” lib-
eration of Europe from June 5 to
June 6, 1944, a decision which
later proved vital to the success
of the strategy.

Eisenhower, Supreme Allied
Commander later wrote to Petter-
ssen “This service on your part
merits very special commendation
as an outstanding contribution to the
success of the Allied invasion."

A native of Norway, Petterssen
was naturalized as a United States
Citizen in 1955. He holds his 8.8.
degree, B.A., and Ph.D. from Oslo
University.

He is the author of a number of
books on meteorology, the latest
“Weather Observations Analysis
and Forecasting” was published in
1957.

Dr. Eugene McLai-en, chairman
of the Division of Science and Math-
ematics at the University, revealed
that Petterssen's duties will be in-
ternational in scope.

He also stated that during this
time Petterssen will be traveling
in Europe in order to help “tie
together the knowledge in this field,"
in addition to the course he will
teach at the University.

MAJOR ANDERSON Spain in support of the United States mili-
tary policy and urged members of the audience to face the real-
istic facts and not iust be moved by emotions.

Anderson Urges Look Back,

Use Facts, Not Emotion

by Jill Pomik

“Now is the time for unity, cour-
age and determination." This was
the attitude upheld in a speech given
Wednesday night by Major Anderson
of the U. S. Marines.

He urged the members of the
"loyal opposition” to look into the
past, at the statement “Peace in
Our Time," a slogan that led to the
appeasement policy of Nazi Ger-
many. He also hoped the members
of the opposition would not base
their views on emotions, but on
realistic facts.

Major Anderson cited, in support
of U. S. forces in South Vietnam,
a statement made by the president
of Singapore “U. S. forces in South

Beckett’s ‘Waiting For Godot’
To Run Weds. Through Sat.

The first Master's Thesis Pro-
duction ever presented by the De-
partment of Speech and Dramatic
Art at the State University of New
York at Albany will be Samuel
Beckett’s WAITING FOR GODOT.
Directed by Bonnee Scott, the play
will run Wednesday through Satur-
day, May 17-20, in the Richardson
Studio Theatre on the Old Campus
at 8:30 pm. The production will
be open to the public.

One of the best-known examples
of the Theatre of the Absurd, WAIT-
lNG li‘Oli GODOT had its premiere
at the Theatre dc Uabylone in Paris
dtiring the 1052-53 season. Follow-
ing the premiere cznne productions
in London, Dublin, Frankfurt, Rome
and Helsinki, and its first American
production was lnNew Yorkin April,
1956.

Now considered as atheatre clas-
sic, GODOT has been called “gro-
tesquely beautiful and utterly ab-
sorbing" as well as "one of the
must noble and moving plays."

Miss Scott, the director of GO-
DOT, is a 1962 graduate of the
State University at Albany. After
teaching for three years at North
Syracuse High School, she returned
to the University in 1966 to study
theatre as a Graduate Assistant in

technical theatre.

Miss Scott chose GODOT as her
thesis production because she feels
the play is a true test of both actor
and director. She expressed the
opinion that the play, since it is
virtually plotless, demands total
interaction of all theatrical ele-
ments if the play is going to com-
municate at all.

Since neither words, story, scen-
ery, nor lights can carry the show
alone, all must be more carefully
developed and coordinated than in
a play outside the Absurd tradition.
The theatre of the Absurd forces
the director to be a kind of iuggler
who must keep everything in line
and in mind at all times or else
everything collapses.

GODOT, Miss Scott, believes
communicates a series of images
of modern man's condition by using
all manner of comedy from slap-
stick farce to English music hall
patter and routines, Vet from these
comic techniques emerges a ser-
ious picture of man.

Tickets will be unnecessary for
this production of GODOT, and seat-
ing will be on space available basis
each evening. There will be no re-
served seals for any performance.
Inquiries regarding the perfor-
mances should be directed to the
State University Theatre.

Vietnam have'been a tremendously
stabilizing influence."

In reference to dissenters, Ander-
son said he felt that for "people
whose only alternative is to get out,
quit, history is passing them by
unheard and unseen.”

He realized that the students who
do not offer dissent are the thinking
students. Those who do not think
"are vegetables.” If the dissenters
want to show their concern they could
“help clothe the naked, feed the
hungry and aid the wounded, rather
than put down our efforts."

Anderson stated that “never be-
fore in the history of the armed
forces have the men been so highly
qualified” in reference to physical
ability, intelligence and determina-
tion. They have compassion for the
South Vietnamese shown by their
helping to rebuild houses and schools
in villages that have been destroyed
by Viet Cong.

Another slide illustrated the'
patchwork agricultural fields in
South Vietnam. Anderson com-
mented that there is a problem in
Vietnam of balancing agriculture
and industry. When most of the
people work in factories tilere is a
deficiency of food.

In reference to tactics used by
the Viet Cong, Anderson said the
same pattern is constantly repeated.
First they come in and clear out
all males over 14 to use them as
porters. Along the Village, holes
are dug in which rifles are sta-
tioned. Houses are fortified.

One of the jobs it is necessary
for the South Vietnamese to do is
search the river traffic. A slide
shoch one boat that was stopped
for a search revealing 60 rounds of
mortar ammunition attached to its
underside,

mander of the Marine Corps Wal-
lace M. Greene, Jr., be stated that

three major things in our favor.
One is the spirit and idealism of
our fighting men.

Another is the flexibility the heli-
copiers have offered, and the con~
viction of two principles: the de-
struction of the enemy and the res-
toration of a peaceful life for the
people of South Vietnam.

Following the film report Major
Anderson entertained questions
from the audience.

VOLUME Lm, NO. 24 :

Voting For Councilmen

Pending Court Decision]:

The decision of wheth. r or not the 1966-67 MYS-,
KANIA will administer tin. Central Council elections
on Monday through Wedne iday is presently pending
announcement of a decision on a referral submitted
to the Supreme Court by MYSKANIA.

The decision to submit
the referral was made by
the ’66-’67 MY SKANIA at
a meeting Monday which
was held in order to dis—
cuss certain technicalities
concerning election pro—
cedure.

Discussion centered around three
technical questions on the legality
of this election, Raymond Cianfrini,
chairman of the ’66-’67 MYSKANIA
announced Wednesday night.

The first question they asked the
Supreme Court to consider was the
legality of having students who are
presently seniors voting for repre-
sentatives to LAAC when they would
not be affected by their elections
next year.

A second question concerned the
manner in which students would
prove living area for the next year,
thus insuring legal voting.

MYSKANIA also questioned the

The following statement was is-

on Wednesday:

“We, the Commission for Aca—

area would like to comment on the
recent hoax raffling of 'an A in any

taste to put in question the integrity
of a mark. Many students were duped
into b lievingthatthe administration

“We would like to state now that
only the individual professor can

grade to be given. Delta Sigma Pi

Cianfrinl presented the fact that
MYSKANIA had only been asked to
administer elections and is not a
legislative body as a rationale for
the measure.

ile also stated MYSKANIA’s re-
sponsibility to run a “just and

Supreme Court met Wednesday but
declined comment on their decision
until being able to present a public

In the event that elections are
