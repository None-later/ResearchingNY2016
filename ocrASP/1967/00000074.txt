new State University College at
Nassau. .

Both students applied for the grant
by writing an essay on how they
would plan a new State University.
They were awarded the grants on
the merits of their ideas.

In his essay, Rosenberg advo-
cated tightening admissions re-
quirements while admitting “more
creative students rather than 90
average grinds." He believes that
this school is getting better in ad-
mitting more inventive students.

Kind of Student
Rosenberg would like to see a
different kind of student admitted
so that, for instance, more students
would vote in a Vietnam referendum
(2052) rather than 80% in a football

ll.

.“There should not be any form of
geographic discrimination against
New Yorkers. They make the place
(University) good." We should, Ro-
senberg believes, "open up the gates
to all New Yorkers who are dual-4
ified."

Another aspect of his composition
dealt with student elections. The
school leaders, he says, “dump on
the students especially during cam-
pus election, because the leaders
say the students are apathetic.”

Rosenberg believes “it is an ar-
ticle of faith not to vote in student

the wrong kind of learning. The
basic problem is a tendency to
reinforce and reward the values at
a materialistic society.” A certain
attitude toward curiosity and inquiry
that will last throughout our lives
should be instilled in the student.

She advocates a plan whereby the
student will be notified as to what
information he is responsible for
and what information he will be
tested on. The student should then
be free to find this information
through any means he wishes. He
should be notified oflecture courses
covering required information; be
may attend them or not.

Students, she says, should ho
stimulated by the greater knowledge
of their teachers while teachers are
in turn, stimulated by the student,
who gets his information from out-
side sources.

Weinstein also advocates greater
freedom in reference to dormitory
rules. “The university is not in
any way responsible for the private
life of the student. If the college
still wanted to make money on
housing facilities they could hate
University sponsored apartments.

"Students could have a roommate
if they wanted to pay less, howevel ,
they should be able to live alone.
Food should be made optional. The
student would retain the freedom
to come and go as he chose."

Her essay also included t’r.ejmz.ts
that students, faculty and adilll'ls-
tration should all work tcge ez’,
each should be able to express mt...
opinions on innovations ll‘. all .in-

pects of the Universuy community.
“If this is a community. exerjwlle
living in it should be entitlted to

elections because the candidates do
not bring out and discuss the issues
in question.” He would like to see
the issues fully exposed and dis-
cussed.

In her essay, Barbara Weinstein
said that “Universities should be a
place where the student acquires
knowledge for knowledge's sake;
where learning is respected.

MESSERLI spoth In the Assembly Hall Wednesday nigltf about

Horace Mann.

Messerli Speaks On Mann
Stresses False Stereotype

Dr. Jonathan Messerll, Professor
of History and Education at Teach-
er’s College, New York, spoke at
the Campus Center in the Assembly
Room Wednesday at 8:00 p.m.

The lecture, entitled “The Edu-
cation of an Educator," focused on
the childhood of Horace Mann. Dr.
Messerli stressed that the present
stereotype of Mann needed some
clarification. He cited that the com-
mon belief of Mann's family living
in “privation and suffering” was
not proven by his researchofMann's
early childhood.

Changing Community

He stated that Mann grew up in a
changing socio-economic commun-
ity which Mann himself perceived
as shifting. This awareness of
changing institutions was incorpor-
ated into the philosophy of Mann's
education, according to Dr. Men'-
serli. '

Based on his research, Dr. Mes-
serlf indicated three spheres of in-
terest ln Mann's life: the influence
of the home, the meeting house and
the school.

The stress throughout the lecture
was on the practical education that
Mann got in his chlldhood from his

The greatest Influence was that of
the local
the strigent tones of the religious
sentiment of the late 17th Century
and early 18th Century.

Religious Tone

It was the effects of this religious
tone, according to Dr. Messex‘ll,
that cemented Mann’s personality
with bitterness and desparlty.

Mann's ability to perceive in-
stitutlonal changes within his com-
munity, while others failed to do
so, insplred him with a feeling of
creating an educational system in-
corporating room for change. It
was here that Dr. Messerli felt
his greatest contribution lie.

Perhaps more important  be'

sponsoring a workshop on the Mo- the academic use: of the comm

hawk Campus this Sunday, May 14.
The purpose of the workshop will
be to draw up a plan to develop in
the next few years more uses for
the campus bordering the Mohawk
River. All the immediate plans
which were set up several years
ago have been realized, and there
is a need for new ideas and pro-
grams for Mohawk.

People participating in the work-
shop will come from the adminis-
tration, faculty and student body.
Mr. Gary Jones, student Activities
Advisor and coordinator of the Mo-
hawk Campus, expressed his hope
that this conference will produce
new and useful ideas, which are
desired by the University Com-
munity. The workshop will be held
on the Mohawk Property.

Some of the concepts Jones hopes
to be talked over will be increasing
the recreation facilities of the cam-
pus. Some ideas of this type are
the construction of forest lean-tbs,
tent platforms, a golf course or a
swimming pool. The members ofthe
workshop will also be discussing
the use of the buildings on the cam-
pus. This toptc most likely will in-
clude the question of the completion
of the barn and house or the pos-
sibility of building a new student

 The Jazz

by Lou Strong

IT’S ALL OVERIH It finally hap-
pened and this reporter lsjust about
the happiest and most relieved per-
son on the face of Stonehenge. But,
in front of me right now is one of
the most difficult tasks ever to
face any man: I have to be objective
about the thing I love. It’s adifficult
task and I doubt if l'm up for any-
thing right now, but that’s beside the
point -but I’ll try my best.

Before I go any further, there are
some very important people that de-
serve public and private recognltlon
for a job very well done. First and
most important, Linda and Denny,
you have shown yourselves to be
two of the hardest working people
ever to grace this campus.

And now to the festival. From my
objective (sic) viewpoint, the festival
was a musical, aesthetic and edu-
catloual success. Otherwise, it
failed. We were trying to show the
student body what is happening in
jazz. WHERE WERE YOU?? At times
I feel that some of you were really
happy to be completely ignorant of
anything that you know nothing about.
I was told that this is the way that it
usually is with a beginning activity,
and I hope that this is true.

For, next year’s festival plans to
be even bigger and more interesting
than this year. But what can the co-
chairman do when the people they
are working for refuse to support
their efforts?

Nick Brlgnola, the righthand of
this festival showed me that Al-
bany's jazz musicians have quite
a bit on the ball. Nick took some
solos that were absolute works of
art. He shows maturity, technical
proficiency, and mastery over one
of the most difficult Instruments in
the repertoire, baritone saxophone.

Dick Berk and Reggie Johnson, our
workhorse house rhythm section,
have got to be one of the most ex-
citing duos going. In Reggie, I found
the ultimate in coolness and peace
that any musician can have with his
instrument. Reggie loves his jazz
and it shows in his playing. He was
constantly pushing it and himself
to the ultimate, making more notes
and runs come through with less
and less difficulty.

What can be said of Elvin Jones?
lie has added so many new things to
the entire concept ofjazz drumming,
that we could easily call this“Elvin
Age." His 50105 are besutlous things
that demand the listener listen. He
speaks beautiful subleties and sear-
ing tirades that can elevate you to
a pitch of frenzy. When he played
with Lee Konltz (alto), Charlie Harlan

' (boss), and Don Friedman (piano),
you could notice a rapport and in-
terrelatloushlp with the four. The
fact that they had played together as
a group before gives great teeth»

To finance these projects-Cork;

to develop the campus. it in *

It is developed.  y

This workshop will,also he used '
to inform the University Community
of what has been done at Mohawk
and what is at its disposal. The '
participants of the conference will
be reporting back to their own
groups what they observed and did.
The reason ‘why this workshop was
established as Jones stated, 'We
don't want to start projects which
people won't be using.’

The campus, which was boughttwo
years ago, has been greatly im-
proved. The house contalns a snack
bar and lounge. The other rooms
of the house have not yet been pre-
pared for student use.

The lagoon or lake is connected
to the old Erie Canal which is con-
nected to the Mohawk River. Con-
sequently the lagoon is polluted.
The lagoon is healthy for boatlngand
canoelng but not for swimming. It
is hoped by the members of Student
Affairs that this problem can be
corrected in the future.

Review

fence. They were able to relate to
each other's ideas, comment on
them and pass them on to the aud-
ience in the true manner of the
movement. This was

in Charlie Haden and Don Fried-
man, we have an interesting facet
of today’s jazz musicians. Don and
Charlie are both accomplished lead-
ers in the "New Thing," but I was
able to realize that they both still
have a firm anchor in the main-
stream of jazz. When they per-
formed with Pepper Adams-Nick
Brignola and with Reese Marke-
wich-Jerome Richardson, the main-
stream ln both of them showed
through. Perhaps this dlsproves the
theory that Lerol Jones and Archie
Schepp have been propagating that
the New Thing is completely new.
It is really just another step in the
evolutionary process that jazz has
been experiencing since its very
beginning.

Muddy Waters and his sextette did
something to the festival audience
that was more titan we could take.
They shook us upll Besides this,
they described the parent of Rock
’n Roll as well as funky jazz.

Jeremy Stelg's Quintet was a
slight disappointment to me.Jeremy
seems to have lost much of the old
feeling that he had for ills flute. Per-
haps it's because of this nw thing
he has going with the new quintet.
It's like nothing he has done before.
There were some patrons that felt
that the group did not belong at a
jazz festival.

As has been the case wherever
they have performed, the Thad
Jones-Mel Lewis band blew the roof
aWAy from the ballroom. They were
one of the many performers that
received a standing ovation from
the audience. I hope to see them.
again at Newport. and watch this
roof-blowing process in action
again.

Walter Bishop Jr. was one of the
highest highlights the festival had.
His piano work was so well re-
ceived that many people wonder
why it is that he is relatively un-
known.

Kenny Burrell did for Sunday
night the some thing that the band
did for Saturday night. With Don
Friedman, Charlie linden. sndElvln
Jones, he played a set that did so
much to the crowd thathewu called
back for more. His moving and un-
usual version oft'Poople" reminded
me of the things 1 hand him do in
Newport ’66. His technique for guitar
as well as his speed on the instru-
ment leave little doubt in my mind
as to who the first guitarist lniqu
