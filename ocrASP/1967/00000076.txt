Mental Cruelty.

To the Editors:

As a self-appointed representa-
tive for the S.P,C.S. (Society for
the Perpetration of Cruelty to Stu-
dents), I must vehemently protest
one aspect of the cartoon of Dan
.Lago, or could it be lago, in the
May 5 ASP. Our members, who
include 90% of the SUNYA faculty,
when. taking their oath of cruelty
are sworn to maintain direct con-
frontation when torturing students.

Any attempt at anonymity such as.
hiding behind hoods, as portrayed
by Lago in his cartoon, can result.
in the Perpetrator being drummed
out of the Society (this is a very
impressive ceremony, by the way).
The reason for this rigid rule is
that the members of the Society
firmly believe in mental ﬂagella-
tion, mainly because it feels so
good. when it stops; since it does
stop for most students at least by
the day they graduate, this gives
them something to look forward to.

For those that continue to under-
go mental fiagellation after gradu-
ation, they may then find that their
tormentors do seek the anonymity
of hoods in the real, non-academic
world. Our Society cannot be held
responsible for non-members, how-
ever.

Sigma Pi's A

To the Editor:

On Saturday, May 6, the Delta
Sigma Pi Fraternity rattled off an
.“A” in any course of the winner's
choosing. It specifically stated on
a sign next to the booth that Dean
Deeringer had consented to such
a rafﬂe. Now that the rafﬂe is
over it has come to my attention
that the entire affair was just a
hoax to entice the student body to
spend its money on a worthless
raffle. it also appears that this
fraternity has made use of the
ASP to publish their “hogwasb.”
Like a “shyster” the fraternity has
screwed the student body of money
which could have been spent on
more worthwhile booths at the State
Fair.

IV Till CLASS 0' "la

It should be noted- that Delta Sig-
m,a__Pi Fraternity booth received a
trophy for collecting the most
money. I believe that this trophy
should be rescinded by the tra-
ternity and given to the booth which
placed second in money collecting.
I also believe that this business
fraternity should apologize to the
student body for its unscrupulous
action. The booth certainly achieved
its purposes by making money, but
as any honest and intelligent per-
son knows, the means do not al-
ways justify the end. These future
businessmen of America lack ethics
and values which any good business-
man should possess.

Ashley Again
To the Editors:

Last week Iwrote, objecting to
your shotgun method of reporting
and editorializing on the Central
Council elections and the roles of
Bill Cleveland and STD in them.
Although the information that has
finally been released tends tojustiiy
your righteous indignation, I still
find the way you manifested that
indignation repulsive.

By making vague and originally
unsupported statements which ap-
peared nearly slanderous to Mr.
Cleveland and STB, you destroyed
any possible trust in your abilities
as reasoned editors. In a time re-
quiring sound reasoning you blow
your cool and lost a marvelous
opportunity to be a constructive
force on this campus.

Temptation

To the Editor:

lie: Mr. Cleveland’s dilemma. The
question oi temptation is not rele-
vant. Mr. Cleveland was not honest
with himself or his fellow students.
The key is personal responsibility.

Prankiine

To the Editors:

Friday night I listened for the
first time, to the "Prankline" on
WSUA. The show is on between mid-
night and l a.m. and i imagine that
is why so few people seem to know
about it. The show is supposed to
be a take-off on "Candid Camera.”

A student calls the station and
requests that someone be called;
the prankster can request the na-
ture oi the prank. The emcee (Rich
Stevens) then calls the victim and

 

In the past several weeks. we have been severely
criticized for stories that we have left out of the
paper. such as the concert given by the band. lists
of fraternity officers, political ads. etc. We made a
statement on this several months ago that we would
like to reiterate.

We do not exist as an extension of the Campus.
Clipboard. A list of events happening is compiled by
the Student Activities Office. In only twelve pages
of the ASP a week, four of which are reserved for
editorial comment and sports, only so much can be
covered. Some decision must be made as to the
relative importance of each issue.

What this newspaper is missing is commentary
on political and social life, the thing which really
affects us all. not front page stories on concerts and
installation banquets. This is going to be remedied
at the expense of uninteresting news stories catering
to small closed groups as this paper has been in
the practice of doing.

. To our minds, activities participated in by thou-
sands each, such as Gentle Thursday, The Happening,
and the Jazz Festival and the panty raids are “what’s
happening.”

l Under Ihe counter Intelligence

the student body was compounded
by their failure to live up to their
promise to Dr. Deeringer that they
would publicize the fact that it was

talks to the person over the radio.

Although I find little that is hu-
morous in waking students out oi a
sound sleep (which occurs frequent-
ly) and then making their gullibility
an abject of derision, I do not object
to University students pulling their
pranks upon one another.

However, I do object, and violent-
ly, to playing these pranks upon
people who are in no way connected
with the campus or the University
community. On Friday, there were
at least three such people involved.

One was an elderly woman who
had placed an ad for miniature dogs
in the paper (she was called at
around 12:15 pm. and kept on the
phone for a long five minutes),
another was connected with the Little
Bavaria which wants to hire a bar-
tender, and the third was the neigh-
bor of a woman who placed an ad
for a mother’s helper.

Certainly all oi these people were
inconvenienced. Yet, in addition,
they were never told why. Univer-
sity student victims were told after
a short period that they were the
object of a WSUA prank (that is
unless they slammed the phone down
as one sleepy guy did),howevor NOT
ONE OUTSIDER WAS so INFORMED
even alter long minutes ofexposure.

THE RING IS TOO TIGHT: Inter-
esting how all of those people who
made themselves obnoxious after
the MYSKANIA elections lastMarch
yelling at me “The ring has rung"
are all of a sudden very sensitive
to mention oi political rings. It is
amazing how perturbed these people
can become at the mention oi a ru-
mor that they started themselves.

HIP HIP HOORAYI: Congratula-
tions to all oi the participants in
the recent panty raid on the Colon-
ial Quad. It turned out to be one oi
the best behaved crowds that l have
ever seen. 1 still, however, fail to
understand the drive behind freez-
ing and fighting for hours over a
stained panty or a half of a stock-
ing with a run in it.

DELTA SIGMA PHOEEI: Our
local international business frater-
nity (sic) seems to be doing a good
job ofpreparingthemselves for their
future places in the American busi-
ness world. We all know that one oi
the basic requirements for a mod-
ern businessman is the ability to
break trusts and a sincere two-
iacedness.

DSP fulfilled both of these re-
quirements last week with their
booth at State Fair. The fact that
they were perpetratlng a hoax on

i do not feel that this is the way
our University should be repre-
sented. We do live in a larger com-

a hoax. They did not even let the
co-chairmen oi State Fair in on the
gag. Sure glad that everyone is
honest in this school.

However, see above quote.

FRISKIE MYSKIES: That iniamous
group oi highly overworked campus
leaders has done it again. After
notifying the ASP of the dates for
the new elections, the 1966-67 MYS-
KANIA has decided secretly to can-
cel their plans. It seems that th
don't know how to carry out a "just
and proper” election and they are
referring the matter to Supreme
Court.

However, due to a shortage of
members, there is no Supreme Court'
so nix for elections this year. The
only people who can appoint new
members oi the Supreme Court are
Central Council, oi which there is
none. 
If the elections are held off until
next year it really becomes a prob-
lem. The Central Council Bill 1987»
68 2 calls for the 1966-67 MYSlg-ANI.
to run the elections. Nextyear these
people won't be around, and the only
people who can amend the bill are
Central Council. Ahai There is no

ernment here again. Three years ago
i vowed that when I go this school

advertently this claim is coming
true.

I The first concert of last week—

iid’s Spring Jazz Festival strolled
off to u start with the walking blues
of Muddy Waters. A professional,

captured the audience, and then
i gave the spotlight to Luther "Geor—
giu Boy” Johnson. Luther sang in a
raw powerful voice that wus Chicago
in style, ycthad Luther's own stump,
or rather stomp, on it.

Perhaps the highlight of this con-
cert was the moody “llound Mid-
” night" given by the members of tho

Ted Curson Quartet, Nick Drignolu,
Reggie Johnson, and Dick Bork.
Curson used his crystal tone to
complement his stark yet coherent

also a highlight. The group played

Miss Wood then portrayed the fear-

A comical touch was provided by
a Scene from “Henry V" in which
Miss Colt as Princess Katherine
enlists the aid of Alice, Miss Wood,
to teach her some "instant English”

The 1967 A. D. Torch is a very
interesting attempt to reflect the
minds of students as Well as their
world as it exists at the University.
It is the more interesting because
in most respects the attempt suc-
ceeds.

There are the inevitable tech-
nical problems such as the failure
to maintain a consistent style of
writing and of technical reproduc-
tion.

The table of contents and the
forward reproduced poorly. Many
of the names were not centered.
but these are minor concerns.

The yearbook succeeds as an
essay in photography. No major
aspect of student life is ignored.
The photography itself ranges from
good to outstanding.

The pictures of the campus build-
ings themselves show both the de-
humanization ofﬂa concrete campus
and the ability of students to make
themselves a home.

The example of graffiti on page
22 is unfortunately alone as an ex-
ample of student opinion. A knowl-
edgeable statement about the city
by a student would have been more

ﬂ°°lsstudent um

 
  
 
   

fitting than the sour grapes of a
local minister. '

Perhaps the myopic element on
the campus has matured enough to
accept the affection shots on page
37. Feet can be obscene. you know.

The photos from the late Bernard
Kolenberg are outstanding. They fit
well into any student book in this
year of concern for the people of
Vietnam as well as for our men
there.

There are hundreds of photos de-
serving of applause, but there can
never be room enough.

The editors are to be commended
for drawing together the endless
facets of human (student) life in a
meaningful, well-balanced book.

Even the laborious task of pic-
turing the seniors is broken up
sufficiently to remain interesting.

The various groups on campus
are all recognized without the usual
boring people in standing and sitting
in rows pictures.

The old was remembered with the
new. Old faithful Minerva was in-
cluded. The alumni will be happy.

Perhaps the feature that will be
appreciate the most is the good
taste of the commentary. The
notes give needed information with-
out descending into trivia.

On the whole, the book must be
deemed a suecess and a tremen-
dous accomplishment both for edi-
tors and staff and for the Univer-
sity.

Chaplin’s 'Countoss’A Failure.
Sadly Marks Fading Genius

Douglas Rathgeb

b
There is nothilig more

agonizing for a critic than

to report the passing of great genius. it is bad enough
having to pounce on a slacking Tony Richardson (“Mad-
moiselie,” “A Sailor From Gibraltar”), a misdirected

Roman Polanski (“Cul De

Sac”) or a cinematically

sloppy Alfred Hitchcock (“Marnig”).

But to have to condemn
a figure as monumental in
the art as Charlie Chaplin.
to any that he seemstohave
reached the endofhis rope,
is a task which no critic
(unless he be a hopeless

misanthrope) would savor.

But if Chaplin's new film, (the
first in nine years) “A Countless
from liong Kong" is any indication
at all of wiiai we can expect from
the aging master, then there is
pitifully little hope, for Chaplin, and

rm- ti .
Onel‘gé‘t'la‘uilllll‘QGeimg title] only a

few moments that it has all been
done before, in a whole flock of
films from the forties and early
fifties. The titles may momentarily
slip your mind, but that plot is un-
misinkable. Watching Chaplin’s film
is like looking at a medley of bed-
room farces from the Late Late
Show. At any monith you expect a
walk-on by Spencer Tracey and
Katherine Hepburn.

At times you hope that one of the
walls of that studio-sot ship's cabin
will crack down and turn the whole
mess into a kind of Richard Lester
superfarce. liut the walls stay up,
amt you sink deeper into your sent.
Your uyclids begin to feel heavy.

Further into the film you begin
to realize that Sophia Loren and
Marlon Brando somehow just don't
appear to be aware of what it is
they're supposed tobe doing. Brando
stunds there with timt Rock of Gi-
braltar expression; Loren just looks
ravishing, which in any of her other
films might be quite enough. Sidney
Chaplin looks as if he has his lilies
scrawled on his palm, and is having
trouble reading them. ’l‘lppl liedrcn
is so stiff that you fear if she fell
over she'd shatter into a million
pieces.

Close to the end that doorbell
buzzer becomes distinctly annoying.
Chaplin seems to use it for lack of
anything better to do. At about this
some time you stop listening to the
dialogue and notice those hoardes of
obvious technical errors that you
might expect from an Andy Warhol
but never the master that produc

"such clsssics as “The Gold Rush"

and “The Great Dictator."
To see "A Countess from Hong

   

Kong" is to see Chaplin lit a de-
cidedly unfamiliar pose. But while
it may not add to his glory as one
of the greatest names in the history
of film, it cannot really detract
either. it is the honest mistake of
a sincere and talented artist who
has simply lost the pulse of his
media, perhaps neVer to find it
with.
