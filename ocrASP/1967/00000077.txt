waiting for! The‘good news that you have been waiting
-for since the beginning of the semester has finally
arrived. This-is the last "ASPect On Sports.”

the sports staff next year. Dunc Nixon will be taking
over as Associate Sports Editor. Both men will have
outstanding sports staffs as we were fortunate ,_to have
this semester, and we’re sure this page will improve
against the old ASP tradition.

What kind of a year has it been?

As the final week of Albany State’s athletics comes
to an end next week, we can justifiably look back upon
a highly successful year. Most of the varsity teams
enjoyed winning seasons, and those that probably
won’t have this satisfaction (baseball and golf) have
only one senior among them,'so it looks like another
banner year in Albany athletics. We hope this will
coincide with the opening of the new physical edu—
cation building in September. If the building is ready
and the teams are at full strength as it looks now, it
could. be the biggest year in the history of intercol-
legiate athletics at this University. All we need is
football tomake it a complete program.

The soccer team, with only three seniors and a
handful of sophomores registered a 5—4—1 record
after losing its first three games. Highlight of the
season was a thrilling 2—0 Homecoming victory over
previously undefeated Potsdam. If Coach Joe Garcia
can find replacements for all—time scoring champion
Maurice Tsododo and fullback Dick Szymanski, the
Danes will most certainly improve on their 1966
mark.

The cross—country team will be invincible next
year. With no one graduating from last year’s 11-1
team, and with the elimination of Holy Cross from
the schedule, the harriers will have a strong chance
to do undefeated, something to which they are ac—
customed.

“Doc” Sauers’ hoopsters will be as tough as
usual. The graduation of Mike Bloom, Jim Con-
stantino, Lonnie Morrison, and Marty O’Donnell
will deplete the ranks of the 10 man squad some—
what, in fact a lot. But the Dane mentor has his
two best players returning for two more seasons,
namely Rich Margison and Scott Price, The re—
turn of Larry Marcus, the addition of two or three
players, the eligibility of transfer students, Dave
Riegel, Vern Lanier, and Phil Caverly, and for the
first time a full-size home court add up to one hell
of a season. We will be looking forward to a pos—
sible NCAA bid.

That’s it for the year, Besides Glen and Dunc,
I want to thank my writers Jim Winslow, Hank
Rabinowitz, Bill Ryan, Ev 'Colman, and Iris Alson
and photographers Gary Gold, Larry DeYoung, and
Steve Fishkin for their thoughtful contributions

throughout the year.

Great Danes Draw With Utica

Will Host Adej

Dunc Nixon

ohi Todav At 3

The Albany Great Danes played Utica College to a 9-9 draw Wednesday in a
marathon 3 hour and 45 minute encounter. Walks and errors were numerous as
neither the pitchers nor the fielders seemed to be able to get warmed up, which
was perhaps due in part to the numbing wind that swept the field throughout the

game.

The Great Danes opened the scoring with 2 in the first, as Jim Murley

reached on an error, stole second, and scored on Denny Elkins single. Elkin moved
up on an error and scored on Andy Christian’s one bagger.

Utica got one back in the
second, but Albany added
two more in the third, when
Murley walked and Elkin
tagged one deep to left for .
a 2 run homer, and a 4—1
lead.

APA Gains Victory Number8

Tom Egelston, who had been hav-
ing control trouble throughout, ran
into difficulty in the fifth. A single,
3 walk, another single, and a pair
of bloop singles produced three
runs. .

Coach Bui‘lingame then called on
Rich Pati'ei, who yielded a perfect
squeeze hunt and a walk, before

' No New Elections A

According To Court

There will be no re-election of
the members of Central Council and
Living Area Affairs Commission.
Last Thursday night Supreme Court
decided that Central Council had no
right to declare elections void. MYS-
KANIA, following the decision ofthe

. court, decided not to hold re-elec-

tions, since there were no vacant
seats to be filled on the council or
commission.

The only section of the bill passed
by Central Council not invalidated

': by Supreme Court are the onespro-

viding for different election proced-
ores and a different type of election
commission.

The three questions presented by
Ray Cianfrinl, chairman of MYS-
KANIA, to Supreme Court are as

l. follows: .

"Shall this election follow the
same procedures as those concern-
ing regular Central Council and
Living Area Affairs Commission
elections as described by their re-
spective election laws?

“Can second semester seniors
elect representatives to Central
Council and Livliig Area Affairs
Commission, and if so, are they to
be permitted To elect representa-
tives according To their pi‘esentai‘ea
of residence?

"To cons‘itute a valid election,
what evidence shall be required of
area of residence?"

"Regarding Question ill:

A. The election sliailfollowpro-
cedures of the Election Bill (5560-
13. According to The procedures in
section 1, part 1, letter C, part 2
'General Student Association elec-
tions are to be held within Two
weeks after the nominations are
opened.’ Therefore, the pasT bill
enacted by Central Council on May
4, 1907 providing for an election
without re-nomiiiaiions is uncon-
stitutional. The only new election
which would be constitutional would
be one including new nominations.

B, li'uriliei' The Court finds them
section ll, paragraph 11, letter A,
part 4 of Election Lilli (5506-13 is
unconstitutional. When dealing with
The validity of an election, the ulti-
mate decision rcsts with The Judi-
cial Branch of tiieVStudeni Associa-

tion, the body of the Judicial branch
vested with the judicial power within
which comes the question of consti-’
tuiionalliy is the Supreme Court.
Therefore, section if, paragraph ll,
letter A, part 4 is unconstitutional
because it is outside the legislative
and executive power of the Central
Council as provided by the Student
Association Constitution to decide
constitutionality.

“Any undergraduate Student
Association member can unequivo-
cably participate in all The respon-
sibilities and privileges of the Stu-
dent Association. This includes the
privilege of challenging the consti-
Tuiionaliiy of all ‘cases of law and
equity, arising under the constitu-
tion, The laws of Student Associa-
tion, and enactments inade,or which
will be made, under their author-
ity.’ (Article IV, Student Associa-
Tion Constitution). An election is
an enactment of Central Council
under Article I, section [I], part g
which states that Central Council
"shall provide for proper and just
Student Association elections and
tabulations of ilie results thereof."

“Therefore, Election Bill 6566-
13 section II, paragraph TI, letter
A, part 4 is unconstitutional be-
cause ii is outside the legislative
and executive power'of Central C
Council and it is, as stated, an
infringement upon the individual
righis of the members of the Stu-
dent Association."

‘Waiting For Godot’ To Open Tomorrow,
First University Master’s Thesis Show

"Waiting for Godot” will open
tomorrow as the first Master's
Thesis Production ever presented
by the Dcpai‘imeni of Speech and
Dramatic Art at The University.

Directed by lloimee Scott, the
play will run Tomorrow through Sai-
urday, May 20, in ilie Richardson
Studio Theatre on the Old Campus
at lizilO p.m. The production will be
open to The public.

One of the best-known examples
of the Theatre ofthe Absurd, "Wait-
liig i'ol‘ Godoi” had its premiere at
the Theatre do Unbyione in Paris
during the 1952-1053 season.

Following the premiere came pro-
ductions in London, Dublin, Frank-
furt, Rome and lielsinki, and its
first American production was in
New York in April, 1056. Now con-
sidered as atiieoti'o classic, GODOT
was presented as an example of
new theatre in the 1956 Arena Thea-
ti'e.
Since he initial production. GO-
DOT has been called “grotesquely
beautiful and utterly absorbing" as
well as “one ofthe most noble and
mvofng plays."

Written by Beckett

The author of WAITING FOR 60.

DOT, Trish-born Samuel Beckett,

has also written ENDGAME.
KRAPP’S LAST TAPE, and HAPPY
DAYS, all of which have proven to

be as controversial and provocative ~

drama as GODOT.

Beckett, who lives in Paris, holds
the unique position of being his own
Translator. lie writes originally in
French then prepares The English
translations of his work. In addition
to being a playwright, Beckett has
distinguished himself with novels
such as MALLOY, MALONE DIES,
and MUlTPliY.

Miss Scott, The director of GO-
DOT, is a 1962 graduate of the
University. After teaching for three
years at North Syracuse High School,
she returned to the University in
1000 to study theatre as a Graduate
Assistant in technical theatre.

ller previous directing exper-
ience includes an undergraduate
production of Albee's THE SAND-
BOX and a production each year
when she taught high school. Aside
from directing she has gained theo-
ti'ical experience both as an ac-
tress and technician in productions
which include LYSISTRATA, THE
TCEMAN COMET“, and K185 ME
KATE.

Miss Scott chose GODOT as her

thesis production because she feels
the play is a true test of both actor
and director.

Tickets will be unnecessary for
this production of GODOT,and seat-
ing will he on a space available
basis each evening. There will be
no reserved seats for any perfor-
mance.

FLASH!

As of 'Monday afternoon,
Supreme Court is planning
to issue oldlrective in~
structing MYSKANIA to
hold re-elections this so-
mester because of a ques~
tion being presented by
Martin Schwartz concerning
the erroneous interpretation
Of MYSKANIA '67's of the
