Personal: Attach
To the Editors:

i was greatly upset to read the
review of "Clearing in the Woods"
by Mr. Clurman in your May 9
issue. Actually, I do not consider
the review valid in any sense, as
it merely sank to the level of a
personal attack on Mr. Martin Mann.

, To criticize is to analyze something.

rationally, and then judge it fairly.

How does Mr. Clurmau presume
to judge the production as a whole,
much less the effects of the direc-
tion upon the whole, when his entire
review consists solely of individual
evaluations of the different roles, a
few plaudits for the technical as-
pects, and an asinine generalization
about the director’s relation (or
should I say non-relation) to the
production.

ilen Editor’s 0ullonll

College newspapers vary in quality
from year to year according to the per—
sonnel of the staff. One year’s political
columnist may be replaced by someone
else who has similar insights but a con-
siderably less potent prose style. The
arts section may emerge quite differ—
ently under the direction of a drama-
music major as opposed to a history-

psychology major.
And, of course,

news. -

Other college papers have not been as
excellent in their general coverage, but
they have developed traditions of contro-
versial, provocative, treatment of cam-
pus news. The Spectrum, at the Univer-
sity of Buffalo. is an example of this
type. Finally. there are papers such as
the Queen's College, Phoenix, which ex-
cel in their coverage of the arts, while
offering only fair reporting in other
areas. Then there is the Albany Student

Press.

Over the past few years. the journa—
listic quality of the ASP has varied: the
ASP has continued to look out at the

as editors come and
go, the editorials, the biases, the whole
tone of the newspaper, may vary radi-
cally. However,“even allowing for staff-
related variations, college newspapers
tend to fit into certain grooves. The
Yale Daily News, the Columbia Spec—
tator, The B. U. News, and the Cornell
Sun, have developed an excellent tra-
dition in their reporting and interpreting
of college, national, and international

0ver The counter Intelligence

by Martin Schwartz

"0 Captain; My Captalnl our fear-
full trip is done,

The Ship has weathered every rack,
the prize we sought is won.”

Much to the satisfaction and re-
lief of many, 1 would like to an-
nounce that this is my final column
for the ASP. Over the year, it has
become more and more obvious to
me how much this school is in need
of a troublemaker of sorts.

Over the year i have had two ma-
jor campaigns acted upon. The first
is the inequities of committee ap-
pointments, and, secondly, the un-
believably sloppy way in which elec-
tions have been run. Major steps
toward reformation have been taken
with the passage of two blllsthrough
Central Council.

There are, however, many more
things that need an eagle eye to
watch over. The last few weeks
have pointed up several inadequacies
in the Student Association Constitu-
tion. This document, for instance,
is ambiguous as to whether or not
seniors may vote in the elections.

Again, Central Council has passed
many poor and silly hills which
could use amendment. Misuse of
funds has occurred from

 

Boards to State University Revue.
No one is quite sure who has the
$5,000 the telethon raised; all we
know for sure is that Albany County
Mental Health Unit has not received
a penny of the over $2,000 allotted
to them.

There has been no attempt to
penalize students who do not pay
student tax. Many of them are in
high posts which are financed by
Student Association funds, a viola-
tion of Student Association rules.

Organizations suoh as Delta Sig-
ma Pi are able to cheat, lie, and
break trusts as a group with no
attempt by Student Association at
denunciation.

l’m sure that all of you can add
to this list. If Student Association
is to be anything besides the Board
of Appeals after Finance Committee
that they are now, a great deal of
work and maturity must be made
manifest.

What I suggest is the appointment
of a graduate student or a senior
to watch over the campus for in-
adequacies but with not power ex-
cept to make recommendations or
perhaps a vote on Central Council.
if he can he taught Roberts Rules
of Order, something no one has
done this year, perhaps Mr. Cleve-

 

land's reign can see the return of
a parliamentarian.

This concept is not far from that
of the Scandinavian Ombudsman,
which has been highly successful
as a “complaint window" for the
population at large. My only sug-
gestlon is that this person be old
enough to know what is going on
on this campus, intelligent enough
to understand rational thinking, and
mature enough to withstand the rant-
ings and ravings of the childrenwho
know that they stand to lose by the
introduction of Justice and propriety.

i doubt that there are many cap-
able people on campus willing to
double as parliamentarian and pin-
budsman. Anyone who has attended
a Central Council meeting lately or
read this year's minutes KNOWS
that a parliamentarian is necessary
AS SOON AS Central Council re-
convenes. One semester is long
enough without one.

l hope that l have made an ade-
quate case for an ombudsman within
these space limitations. I'm leav-
ing, kids. It's your. show as to
whether or not you want a good gov—
ernment, an honest government, a
well-run government, and anethicai
goverrunent. i hope that you are up
to it. ‘

Direction cannot be separated
from the production as an isolated
aspect. The sum is only equal to
its components. Everything which
takes place upon the stage is a
result of a specified plan of action
by that one man at the controls.

For this reason, to talk of the
actors as isolated individuals, and
ignore their all important inter-
action as guided by the director,
not to mention practically every
other element on stage, and then
have the unmitigated gall to say
that this complex construction can
succeed in spite ofthe man in charge,
is positively one of the most hor-
rendous examples of criticism (7)
every printed by this most eminent
tabloid.

I won't even both to go into the
disgusting generalization made
about all of Mr. Mann's previous
shows (summed up in one sentence).
I suggest that if you wish to main-
tain any kind of an intelligent stand-
ard of journalism, you read what
you print, before you print it. I
also suggest that you seriously con-
sider whom you call upon to. do
your future reviews.

ASP High Standards

To the Editors:

1 must congratulate you for once
again adhergng to high literacy and
cultural standards. I am speaking
about the refusal of some of the
editors to include any stories, pic-
tures, or announcement whatsoever
about the series of upcoming Music
Department Spring Concerts.

Tuesday's paper managed to have

. a six-inch square space on the front
page, devoted to such an“important
event” as the panty raids. It seems
you might have been able to make
room for anotice aboutthe concerts,
a topic at least as newsworthy.

This is just part of the general
reluctance encountered, at times,to
print any feature articles of im-
portant musical events this year.
The ASP is snubbing the major---
the ONLY---large musical ensem-
ble on campus.

Before i go any further, 1 must
make an acknowledgment to the Arts
Editor, who HAS been as coopera-
tive as possible, but llmagine she
only ilas a certain amount of free-
dom.

An article and pictures, compiled
by Mr. William Hudson, director of
the band, were brought over to the
ASP office on four occasions, before
there was even someone there to
look at them. The last time was
Friday morning, solknow Tuesday’s
paper had not already gone to press.

We hope that in the future, the

Kaufman To Direct ‘F antasfiks’

Pan-Hell Council
New Reorganized

Pan-Hellenic Council has reor-
organized and elected officers un-
der a new constitution. This con-
stitutional change makes Pan-Hell
an “issues and concerns” body
separate from ti-isc, which will
function as a voice of the Gross
on campus.

lts basic purpose is to foster
opportunities for individual Greek-
Faculty-Adminlstration interaction
at all levels of University activity.
Its new membership is comprised
of one member from each fraterity
and sorority, two representatives
from the Student Activities Staff,
one member from the teaching fac-
ﬂty, and one residence staff mem-

r.

Pan-Hellenic Council is a Board-
Level organization with a Commis-
sion-type status in the student gov-
ernment and, as such, its policy
statements will be reported to Can-
tral Council, Student Affairs Coun-
cil, and the University community
at large.
