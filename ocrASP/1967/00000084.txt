Janis Inn in Concert Tonite
With Buffalo Springfield

by Janie Samuels

Janis Ian and The Buffalo
Springfield will be in concert to-
nite, Friday, September 29 inihe
Campus Center Ballroom. The
event is being sponsored ,by the
Senior Class and the Special
Events Board.

Janis ion, a sixteen-year-old
high school student who hails
from Metropolitan New York
City, is best known for her re-
lease, t'Society's Child."

However, this controversial
record dealing with the tragic
love affair between a white girl
and her negro boyfriend was not
played .at first on, the top forty
radio stations because of its
racial content.

it was not until Leonard Bern-
stein issued a statement com-
mending Janie fan for the musical
talent displayed on her record -
that the stigma was lifted. Mr.
Bernstein's confidence in her as
one of the brightest up and coming
young recordw sin“ lmlpedpro-

mote Miss lan's rise to fame.

KRLA, Pasadena, California
was the first radio station to have
the courage and initiative to issue
a public apology for not playing
“Society’s Child.” The other top
forty stations soon followed suit.

Miss lan's other releases in-
clude “YoungGeneration Blues,"
and "Janey's Blues."

The Buffalo Springfield first
made their impact on the pop
market in the early spring of
1967 with their release, “For
What it's Worth" which soon
reached the top ten on a national
survey.

Before this they came out with
the song, "Nowaday's Ciancey
Can't Even Sing" in late 1960.

The group consists offive men.
Their main writer is a man nam-
ed Steven Stills who wrote “For
What it's Worth" and also “Bit
Down 1 Think i Love You" for
another group called the M010
Men.

hours.
Administration Hones

In applying for the license, the
administration originally asked
that liquor be allowed in the
lounges of the dorms and those
in the academic buildings.

in addition to this, President
Collins approved of the idea that
liquor be served in the patio
areas surrounding the Campus
Center, and in other locations
for special events.

State Dictates

However, in order to do this,
“ the State Liquor Authority would
have to give a special license
which would take six months or
more" to formulate. “This was
told to President Collins who
said we should get something as
soon as possible."

The license We now have has
a stipulation "that no service of
alcoholic beverages be made in
the patio area of this complex
and that the sale and service of
alcoholic beverages is to be con-
fined within the Campus Center
building:" ,

Mr. Neil C. Brown, director
of Student Affairs, feels that the
new license will allow ant'ampli-
fication of living in an adult
manner." When asked if he felt
that the students could handle
this amplification, Brown stated
that he “has faith in the Uni.
versity student. The University
years are a time for growth and
learning of all kinds. It's more
than books."

Must Follow Civil Law

He said, however, that “the
legal provisions of the license
must be strictly adhered to. We
must follow Civil law and pro-
visions to the full measure be-
cause of obligations and because
we believe in it."

"We're all responsible for
keeping the license. It would be
the worst possible thing if we
lost it, especially after havuu
waited so long. A lot depends on
communications with students.
Students have to know what the
regulations are."

“Student leaders will have an
opportunity to hear from Brown
.and his staff in reference to

Special Events Boardwillagain
sponsor student Activities Day
this year on Saturday, September
80 between 10 AM and 2 PM. Un-
likerearlier years, the program
will be held on both the uptown
and downtown campuses in order
to make it more convenient for
the Freshmen and transfer stu-
dents to attend.

Rosemary Cania and Frances
Lite, along with the other mem-
bers of the Board are hopingthat
this year's event will be success-
on in "creating new interest" in
the various activities oncampus.

All of the major organizations
are to be represented this yearat
both locations and the number of
booths is expected to reach 30 or
35. Each organization will have
members on handtoanswerques-
tions as well as pamphlets de-
scribing their activities. Prof-
erence cards will be available for
the students to fill out and the
clubs will contact potential mem-
bers.

The wide range of organiza-
tions represented should include
a field of interest for everyone

who attends. Religious and ser-

vice organizations as well as the
more widely known literary and
dramatic organizations will have
booths to explain their activities.
Political, scholastic and social
organizations will also hips to
recruit new members.

Some of the clubs have arrang-
ed for special programs inorder
to help generate interest. The
Psychology club will put on a
psycho-drama, and the Associa-
tion of Computer Machines hqees
to be able to give students a look
at the University's new computer.
Refreshments will be supplied
by thech and the ISO.

WSUA, as in the past, will
broadth from Student Activities
Day downtown, and win provides
special program of “pick-and-
play" on the new~campus. Guides
will be available throughout the
day to answeranyquestions about
the school or activities that may
arise.

Uptown the event will be held
in front of the Campus Center,

and since the area is protected
the site will remain the same
in case of rain. Downtown, Stu-
dent Activities Day will be held
in the Quad. Brubacher’s lower
loung will be the site if weather
demands. ‘

Student Activites Day has be-
come a tradition oncampusandit
is hoped by those involved that it
may generate an interest in
campus activities on the part of
old and new students alike. In the
past the activity has been con-
sidered a tremendous success
with more than a thousand pre-
ference cards returned. The co-
chairmen are striving for even
greater success ‘his yeaf.
