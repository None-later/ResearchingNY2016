Film Tonight

Tonight the international Film
Group- will present the Marx
Brothers in one of their best-
known films, "Monkey Busi-
ness."

Once out of fashion in cine-
ma circles, the filmsofGroucho,
Harp and Chico are now gradual-
ly being appreciated for their
verbal inventiveness and side-
spiitting sight gags. The subtle
and surrealistic elements in
their comedy do not date: un-
like most films of the 1930s,
these pictures seem fresh and
spontaneous. (One need only
glance at the films of Richard
Lester to see how viable this
free-form, knookabout style is.)

‘fMonkey Business" has a typ-
ically convoluted plot. The broth-
ers, stowaways on an ocean lin-
er, hire themselves out as rival
bodyguards to two feuding gang-
sters. But as usual the plot is
not too important, and the trio

feel free to improvise dialogue ‘

and scenea'when the spirit moves
them. Each has a chance to dis!
play his own comedic specialty:
Harpo's frantic miming, Chico’s
elaborate plotting and panning,
and Groucho'a tours de force
of repartee,.the goal (1 which
is to make absolutely certain
no conversation I 1s anywhere.

“Monkey Business" will be
shown at 7:00 and 9:16 in Drap-
er M0 on the Old Campus. Ad-
mission ia 8.25 with student tax,
$.40 without.

Pcrlmutter Discusses
AcademicRegulatwns

An informal interview with Dr.
0. William Pearlmutter, Dean of
the College of Arts andSciences,
disclosed some oi the topics
considered by the Committee on
Undergraduate Education which

has been working since last Jan-v '

“NY.

The purpose of thepcommittee
was to consider and re-evaluate
all aspects of undergraduate ed-
ucation in all areas from new
ways of obtaining Master's De-
gree to grading systems.

The committee will not pre-
sent its formal report until
early in October after which it
will be slated for further dis-
cussions.

Webb Flser, vice president for
Academic Affairs, headed the
committee and worked in close
coordination with other facul‘
ty members.

Pearlmutter stressed the fact
that undergraduate education
must be, in effect, re-deiined to
eliminate the idea that it must

'only aPPly to students some-

évhere between the ages of iti-
2.

He said the committee also
favored strongly getting away

Tryout ,Datcsf
Gantry Kendall?

"Elmer Gantry," the ar
novel by Sinclair Lewis, has been
selected for the opening fall pro-
gram of the Readers Club.

This program is scheduled for
Oct. 20 and 2!, according to Mr.
Robert Fish, director.

Try-outs for bewis' powerful
novel should prove particularly
interesting as Fish selects these
best suited to portray the way-
out characters, including the re-
doubtable Reverend Gantry.

Fish pointed out that the no-
vel demands many male charac-
ters and because ofthis,he hopes
for a large male turnout.

Try-outs will begin at 7:30 p.m.
in Humanities 39 on Tuesday.
Anyone unable to attend the Tues-
day’s try-out should contact Fish

from the idea that it must be a
four year process; it should be
as easy as possible for students
to drop in or out of school when
financial or other matters make
it necessary. '

They talked heavily of revamp-
ing the requirements and meth-
ods oi obtaining the undergrad-
uate education and hope to pre-
sent five alternate routes a stu-
dent may take in order to com-
plete this work.

One idea considered would
take the first two years for
a general program and combine
the last three years into a unit
which would allow the student to
obtain an mA within this time.

Highly specialiseddepartment-
al programs were alsoreviewed,
even to the point ofconsidering
a University of small highly spe-
cialized colleges on the order of
Oxford and Cambridge.

Although this small college
idea was discussed heavily,
Pearlmutter said the general
consensus of the committee ran
to the feeling that it would be
a retreat into the nineteenth cen-
tury rather than a step forward.

I Syrett's speech was the most
_' ezsmplory Convocation speech

we have board; We are also
pleased to' note that we have
heard ‘ Syrett's speech un-
equioooally praised from all
sides.- by Jill Pazmk
. ’Sto/I Reporter
The main address it the 124th
traditional Convocatial ' and

’ Candlelight Ceremony was the

focal point of the’ evening.

The address, delivered by Dr.
Harold C. Syrett, Vice Chancel-
lor oi the state Universityofihw
York, dwelt on the consequence

. (1 academic folklore.

Syrett pointed out that "knowl-
edge is not statis; it changes
and increases." if teachers sim-
ply relate facis they have read
they are not doing their part in
the educational process.

He discussed “Sponge Uni-
versities,” which are places of
higher education where the teach-
ers act as “wet sponges" and
become‘ soaked dry by student
“dry sponges" until the end of

horses Academic" Folklore

syrett divided teachers into
three categories: “absolute
bums" at the bottom level, "il-
luminating and inspiring minds"
on. the highest . level and the
majority of teachers in the mid-
dle "gray" category.

.The, most significant role of
the teacher, according to Syrett,
is to actasa stimulant and trouble
maker to goad the student into
learning, and yet not take the
pleasure and enjoyment out of
learning. Syrett referred to this
as "To 'disillusion without dis-
enchanting."

He also stressed that students
may have two attitudes when they
come to college. One is to be
taught, the other is to learn.
The former puts the student in
passive role while the actual
burden rests with the teacher.
The latter will take place “al-
most in spite of the teacher."

President Evan R. Collins,
speaking on behalf of the stu-
dents, governing board and fac-
ulty, expressed a sense of pride
in the University community. He
spoke of fire as an old symbol

the year when the students are ' used against fear and as a tool

soaked dry by finals. The end
result is that nothing is learn:
ed. Syrett felt that Albany was
not this type of university.

Mantovani In
Concert In Troy

Tomorrow

Mantovani and his 45-plece or-
chestra will return to the Tri-
cities area on his tenth tour
tomorrow night at the R.P.I.
Field House in Troy, at 8:30
p.m.

it has been said Mantovani
"knows the kind of sounds he
wants to hear and he know how
to transcribe notes on paper,
so that musicians can produce
these sounds."

The sounds oi the Mantovani
Orchestra are largely compos-
ed oi string sounds, and Man-
tovani has written a large num-i
ber of his own compositions.

He wrote many oi them when
he couldn't find something which
already existed to suit the need
oi his 46-plece orchestra. Man-
tovanl's composition “Toyshop
Ballet” gained him the ivor No-
vello Award in 1957.

The English Department will
sponsor a series of lectures this
year of general appeal to auni-
versity audience. The lecture
series will involve four speakers
and one post. ,

The series will begin on
October 26 when George Ford,

noted author, will speak on
"Dickens and the Eternal
Moment."

The members oithe committee
are sure that since the selected
speakers will speak on topics of
general interest the lectures will
be worthwhile for non-English
majors.

This lecture series has been
made possible by the work of a
committee headed by Dr. Town-
send Rich and includes Mr. Hugh
Maclean, Mr. Donaldstauiferand
Mr. Thomas Smith, all oi the
English Department.

The program will be continued
on November 28 with Stanley
Hyman, one of America's most
eminent literary critics, discuss-
ing “Iago; Some Approaches to
Motivation."

In February, the literary
scholar and author of the off-
Broadway success, "Hogan’s
Goat,” William Alfred, will speak
on the "Tragic Concentration in
Beckett's Waiting for Gogot."

Then, in March, Claude T.
Bissel, president oi the Uni-
versity oi Toronto, will speak on
"The Humorist As Social Critic:
Leacock and Twain." He will be
followed by Robert Wallace, an
exciting young figure among
American poets, whowill present
a poetry reading.

Facade of State
Quad Dismays

Arriving Frosh

Dust, dirt, noise and state
Quad were there to greet the
freshmen to the New Campus
this year. There to help the in-
coming class were the "71 vol-
unteers oi the State Quad, the
R.A.'s and dorm directors.

On the whole, the Fresh took
their luck graciously. Some rt.»
marked upon entering their un-
tiled rooms, “Well, here we
arei" Another stock phrase used
by the Freshmen as they looked
at their uncompleted rooms was
“Well this is it."

The scene was a hectic one:
Parents looking as befuddled as
their children. Somewere helping
to unpack the trunks in the lobby
and carrying the contents up three
ﬂights of stairs.. Others wen
taking armfuls of blankets, lamps
and other necessities to the
rooms they were paying for.

The workmen tried their best
to continue their work despite the
presence of several hundred peo-
ple. in Steinmetz Hall a grinder
was filling half the lobby full of
sparks. Carpenters were building
the main desk at Tappan Hall. in
all the completed dorms the stu-
dents checked into the completed
rooms at the main desk. instead
of R.A.’s at Tappan they had car-
penters.

The checking in procedurewas

conducted out of doors for allthe
dorms. This unexpected inform-
ality helped to create the overall
picture of a carnival preparing
for its first show. Peeple were
hurryingi Dresses, yellow,
green, white and red, were being
carried around. Workman were
building around the hustle. There
was talk everywhere about every-
thing.
The quad isn't totally com-
posed of Freshman. There are
quite a few upperclassmen who
are enduring the newly opened
dorms with the Fresh. All these
Sisters must look longineg at the
green grass on the other side of
the campus.
