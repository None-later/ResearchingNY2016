THE sums of the Mohawk Barn after the fire

   
  
 

    

   
   

which destroyed it this summer. The building
contained the area known as the club room.

MohakaarnDestroyed

Plagued By Two Fires

During the past summer the
Mohawk property was hit by two
separate fires. The barncontain-
ing the recently remodeled room
was burnt to the grotmd by a
fire of undetermined origin.

The other fire was caused by
a kiln which proved too hot for
the roof of its building.

The barn fire destroyedevery-
thing in the great room which was
to house the large parties and
gatherings. The building,had Just
received a new coat of paint, and
the remodeling of a second room
was in progress. It also destroy-
ed the garage near the barn.
Many machines and large tools
were rescued from the flames.

A new building will be built
to take the place «1 the old barn.
This building, now lnthe planning
stage, will not have the antiquity
of the barn but will be construct-
ed especially for the use of stu-
dent and faculty groups.

Presently the house on the
property will accommodate 40
to 60 people. All other facilities
at Mohawk are in operation and
have been improved during the
summer. The permanent stafihas
been increased from one tothree
employees.

Damage caused by the kiln
fire only razed the roof as the
concrete walls and kiln were fire
proof. The damage was slight,
and will easily be repaired.

'87 Conference Assistant ~.

"if this conference has no
impact on you," been Sorrel!
Chesin asserted, “if you leave
here Friday feeling nothing —
that the three days had been
wasted — then you better do
some serious thinking when you
get home about why you’re com-
ing to college and why you’re
coming to Albany in particular."

So began each of the‘seven
freshmen summer planning can-
ferences — with Associate Dean
1! Students Chesin demanding that
each freshman feel “all theemo-

tions" - anxiety, excitement,‘

happiness, fear — during his
three-day summer stay that is
a veritable cram session in stu-
dent emotions.

Yet in spite of the numerous
tensions that accompany sucha
visit to a totally new environ-
nent, a vast malorltv of the
students left the SUNYA cam-
pus sharlng acommon feeling
— a marked eagerness about
returning in the fall.

During the conferences, the
staff was continually impressed
by the maturity level ofthe fresh-
men and by the contagious en~
thusiasm exhibited by the class.
This high-spiritedness was par-
ticularly evident in the rugged
volleyball games and Thursday
night songfests. In fact, members
of one conference decided upon a
re-union during the following
week at Nathan's in Ocean-
side, L.l.

There were fire modified plan-
ning conferences for transfer
students that dealt primarily with
credit transfer and pre-registra-
tion. The transfers arrived
around noon on Monday and left
at various times on Tuesday
afternoon.,

Such events as meetings with
counseling service, group and in-
dividual academic advisement,

talks on student extra-curricular
activities, tours of the campus
center and the downtown campus,
and slides and a movie showing
off-campus properties and vari-
ous academic facilities filled the
bulk of these programs.

More informal orientation in-
cluded a volleyball game, hooten-
army (with ‘a newly organized
group known as the Coderence +
l, comprised of Andy Nagel,John
Birchler 8: Bill Northdruft pro-
viding professional entertain-
ment), a mixer, and eveningsmall
group bull-sessions.

Members of the SPC staff in-
cluded' Miss Leila Moore (con-

, ierence coordinator), Mr. Jim

Hayes, assistant co-ordinator in
charge of residences; conference
assistants Tony Casale, Maggie
Dietz, Mike Ginsburg. Betty Gus-
so, Pat Lewis, Ray McCloat,
Jest Mishkin, Judy Mysllborski,
Mary Margaret Seymour, Bebe
Skutnik, Rich Stevens and Connie
