A bit of Finland has

transported to Dippikill, the Uni-
versity property whose purpose,
ass in questionlastpyear. A
team bath has been constructed

 

 

' by Dr. Thomson Littlefield and a

  

number of University. students.
Dr. Littleileid was impressed
by the idea of building a Sauna ,

  
  
 
  

\‘l, after he spent a year in Finland

on Sabbatical leave from the

University. in Finland Sauna

baths are very popular. People

have them in their homes aswell

v as for the public.
Work begun

Last spring during senior Week
students began work on the pro-
tect which took all summer.
Those who went to Dippikill the
first week included Littlefield
and his daughter Lydia, Judith
Mills, Marcia Lemke, Nancy
Papish and John Woytowish.

That first week progress was
made as the foundation was dug,
the cement poured and three
sides were fabricated. The walls
were first put together out of
plywood and then put up. Things
didn't go smoothly for the group
all summer. Equipment was
stolen and had to be replaced
and windows were broken.

Another problemwas the trans-
portation of equipment. The Sauna
is located across the lake from
the farmhouse and no main road
reaches the Sauna site. All ma-
terials had to he carried on a
canoe across the lake.

_The gggup laughed over the
fact that originally Littlefield had
expected the whole Sauna to be
completed In one week but it
wasn't heated untilSeptemberle.

The first ones to try the Sauna
were Littlefield, Miss Papish
and Frank Snow, campus

 

  

minister. The procedure is to sit
in the heated Sauna for about 15
minutes and then dive into the
lake and back into the Sauna
several times. Members of the
group wore bathing suits for
the experience.

A member of the first group
described the Sauna as very re-
‘reshing and cleansing since it
opens up the pores of the skin.
The group had to become re-
freshed and ready for the mile
trek back to the farmhouse where
they staved.

, Building design

The building itself was design-
ed by Peter Parsons, an Albany
architect who was asked for help
by Miss Mary Raddant of the Art
Department. He also was at the
site almost everyweekend to help
with the construction and to make
any last minute changes in the
plans. The dimensions are based
on Le Corbusier's theory "the
Modular" which involves human
proportions and the “GoldenSec-
tion." The building is eight feet
high, eight feet wide and 12 feet
long.

Those who visited Dippikill
during the summer to offer their
labor or moral support included
both students and facultyand no
one was paid. The only cost will
be that of building materials and
equipment.

Some of the Sauna tans expect
to be enjoying this new activity
all winter, perhaps with a roll in
the snow instead of a dive in the
lake so this may become the new
winter sport for the University
and finally a new purpose for
Dippikill may be found after ques-
tioning its development and use
since its purchase in 1956.

VISTA Field Representatives

Visit Campus for Recruitin

—VISTA News Special

Volunteers in Service to
America is a long name for a
group with a direct purpose: to
make tangible contributions to
the 40 million impoverished peo-
ple in the United States.

VISTA is continually on the
lookout for persons with the de
sire to not just talk about help-
ing, but who are willing to make
a commitment to act.

A field representative from
VISTA will be looking for this
kind of person when he visits
the State University of New York
at Albany on October 9-11. His
information center will be located

library basement.

Also scheduled is the showing
of a VISTA documentary film.
it will be shown daily (location
and time to announced) during
the recruiting drive. The show-
ings are free and open to the
public.

VISTAs are willing to serve
in any of the United States and
its territories where invited by
a local agency to help fight pov-
erty while living in the community
they serve. They live in urban
and rural areas, in migrant
camps, on indian Reservations,
in Job Corps training centers,
and work in the field of com-
munity and mental health.

Their period of service is

one year plus six weeks of train-
ing. The minimum age is 18.
Volunteers are given allowances
for food, housing personal ex-
penses, plus a stipend of $50
for each month served.

Currently 4200 Volunteers are
serving on the front lines of the
War on Poverty; there are re-
quests for over 18,000 ViSTAs.

Maybe when they write about
these times we're living in, it
will turn out that one important
thing we did was to try to do
something about poverty. Not Just
hand out some charity to the
poor, but that we gave our time
and energy to really do some-
thltng about the reasons for pov-
er y.

Autobiography: A Recapitulation

married at age 22 and soon discovered that it

by Thomas Costello

in 1959, John Freeman of the B.B.C, asked
Bertrand Russell if he had written an auto-
blosrnphy. The Earl replied that he had, but
that it would not be published until his death.
But here it is 1967; Russell is still very much
alive and as controversial as ever on both
sides of the Atlantic; and his autobiography
Is in the bookstores. Why the change of heart?
The answer appears to lie in the fact that only
the first volume of the autobiography is avail-
able, and It deals only with the earlier aspects
of Russell's life: his family background educa-
tion, his ideas on love, and the formulation of

his theories of logic.

Russell accepts the cliche that the acorn
doesn't fall far from the tree, and attributes
to each side of his family certain of his In-
herited characteristics. Born of an aristocratic

had been a mistake. His extra-marital affairs
are explicitly set forth without the vanity or
the shame in which autobiographers generally
cloak themselves when writing for posterity.
Such honesty is typical of the man.

Perhaps the most important parts of the book
are the collections of letters inserted through-
out. The lotters vary in historical importance
with notable signatures such as those of William
James, Alfred North Whitehead, the Webbs and
Joseph Conrad, Interspersed among those of
his wife, grandmother and family friends. The
candor of Russell in his replies indicates a
relationship with those greats which was more
one of close personal friendship than of pro-
fessional acquaintance.

It is in the letters to his family, however,
that we begin to see the changes in Russell's
