Three Plays Planned
For Theatre Evening

Three community theatre
groups at the New York State
Community Theatre Association
Conference here at the Univer-
sity will be presenting plays in
Page Hell, Friday, October 6
starting at 6:60 p.m.

The triple-barrelled evening
will include Tennessee Williams'
“The Gnadiges Fraulein,” pre-
sented by the Newburgh Civic
Theatre; the Rome Community
Theatre’s production of Joseph
Golden’s "The Contract" and
Gian Carlo Monotti's "Amshl
and the Night Visitors," present-
ed by the Pleasantville Music
Theatre. This ambitious program
of theatre is open to the public
and tickets may be purchased or
reserved at the Campus Center.

The first play on the triple-
bill, “The Gnadiges Fraulein,"
was originally presented in 1966
at the Longacre Theatre in New
York City. Tennessee Williams
describes ‘Cnadigos Fraulein"
as a "short fantastic work whose
content . ie a dislocated and wide-
ly idiomatic sort of tragedy."

in production the play becomes
a "fantastic allegoryonthetragi-
comic subject ottoman existence
on this risky planet." He sees
the play as “kin to vaudeville,
burlesque, and slapsth with a
dash of pop art thrown in. The
time of the play is the present;
the setting is the southern-most
key of the most southern state
of the Union. The cast of charac-
‘tora includes Polly, the gossip
columnist and society editor of
a local newspaper; and Molly,
who runs a bear house whose
patrons are mostly wines and
vipers (users of marijuana).

The “G iges Fraulein" is
also a resident d Molly's “Big
Dormitory." She is a former
European theatrical star. ladies

Joseph Golden, the author of
the second play on the program,
“The Contract,” is currentlth
Executive Director of the Per-

forming Arts Facility Commit-

tee of Syracuse and Onandaga
County. "The Contract" con-
cerns an aging "it" girl of the
i620s, one of filmdom’s bright-
est stars. Alone, poor, eccen-
tric, she is confronted with an
agreement made years before
with her studio: to give them
her life whenever they wanted
it. The studio, represented by
a super organization man, has a
tough time collecting, and both
characters find themselves
caught in the contract.

“Amahl and the Night Visit-
ors,” the third production of the
evening, is the well-known work
of Glen Carlo Menotti which has
become traditional Christmas
fare on national television.

pher. ills photos in the display
are of people, places and things
and are quite good.

This is because of Scimitzer's

r uncanny ability at framing his

subject. There is a pictured
a narrow street in Genoa: the
street itself is bright and alive
with light, but the photo was so
taken that shadows — black she-
dows — of buildings frame the
sides and. bottom of the scene.

. This natural black frame gives
added emphasis to the street
scene. Another photo shows a

across the top it the picture
can be seen the sludow cfSchnit-
zer's finger. This blacks out a

great deal of useless and dis-

tracting sky, andemphasizosthe
tower in the picture's center.

There are also several pic-
tures of docks and warves which,
while good, are rather reminis-
cent of the photographic display
of Joseph Alper's last year —
even so, these are still good.

Some of Schnitzer's best pho-
tos, however, are his portraits.
The ones of the girls are par-
ticularly notable for the emo-
tional qualities brought out by
the qualities of the lighting and
the highlighting. it gives a qual-

and 8938011.

For two summers the center has been the
home of the New York City Ballet and the
Philadelphia Orchestra, as well as.host to
numerous guest artists such as Van,C1iburn,
the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Rudolf Serkin,
Joan Baez and the Tijuana Brass to mention

only a few.

it has been my pleasure to have attended
several performances there during the past
two seasons, and i wish to impart to you some
of the enthusiasm and immeasurable respect
which i hold for this vestiture of fine art.

Architecturally and acoustically it is truly
a masterpiece. The 5,100 seat amphiteater is
located in a very rustic settling among trees
and surrounded by lawns on which one can
sit for a very minimal cost and enjoy a con-
cert under the stars. it is a brown steel struc-
ture open on three sides through which the
soothing evening breezes can blow providing

natural airconditioning.

The Spectator
A View of tbe Am

by Robert B. Cutty

The Drama Department has al-
ready chosen the plays it will
present for the 1967-66 season,
and I am rather surprised to

note that the productions are

all somewhat serious minded.
The first play, for which an-

V ditions have already been com-

pleted, will be presented in No-
vember. it is Brecht’s "Private
Life of the Master Race" and will
be staged by Mr. James Leonard.
Leonard's previous productions
include "Of Mice and Men,” his
very successful Fall, 1965 sea-
son opener.

l have noticed, as a personal
observation, that leopard is fair-
ly humanistic. His Steinbeck play
was handled with subtlety and
warmth, mingled with a light
sense of humor at certain points
and a constant understanding of
the poignant nature of human

. relationships.

Last Spring, Leonard’s pro-
duction was a Kaufman-Connelly
comedy of the 1620s, "Merton of
the Movies.” Here Leonard found
it truly difficult to surmount the
corny sentimentality that flowed
like thick syrup through all three
sets of 'Merton.’ But he succeed-
ed in salvaging a fairly pleas-
ant comedy, anyway.

Erechl’s play will surely be
a challenge. it is laced with a
strong streak of savage wit that
touches every dirty corner of
life. Brecht's fierce, biting com-
mentary on human relations, a
prime feature of all his works,
makes this play a tough, dark,
exciting drama.

l'm wishing Leonard the best

Now that l have commented on the tech-

to turn to the performances. it is my inten-
tion here to deal with the Philadelphia 0r-
chestra. One adjective reigns supreme when
describing the superb group which has me-
tured and trained under the skilled baton of
its director, Eugene Ormandy, and this is

“ Perfection."

Ormandy has been with the orchestra since
1936 when he assumed the position held by
Stokowskl, and has held this position for 61
years (unequalled by any other conductor).
During this time he has molded and shaped
the orchestra, creating that smooth and ex-
pressive “ Philadelphia Sound."

The Jazz

Revrew

by Lu

This past summer has been
very good to me. Though iwasn’t
able to attend any of the festi-
Vals that were held this summer,
I was able to get some very
good inside information on jazz
issues. But, that's neither here
nor there. The basic objective
of this column is to give you
students some insight on jazz
happenings throughout the world.
So, we start . . .

A very interesting thing has
happened to the two major jazz
magazines of this country. As
of July, both "Dowzbeat" and
"Jazz" magazines have broad-
ened their scope to include Pop
or Rock 'n Roll. This could be
a very interesting innovation and
the implications are fantastic.

First of all, realize that it
was only a few short years ago
that jazz was considered the un-
cultured music. We were lucky
if any major "Establishment"
organization paid any attention
to us at all. Now, jazz is esta-
blished and it seems that our jour-
nalistic organs have been fit to
give status to Rock. Shades of
the Upper-Class!

Now, i don't want anyone to
get the opinion that i am against
this innovation. 0n the contrary,
l wholeheartedly support it.
There is too much good stuff
going on in itook today for it not
to be seen and discussed in the
' 'legitimate," as opposed the typ-
ical Rock and Teen magazines we

9 stands

Downbeat and Jazz (now called
Jazz a Pop) have implied that

ed, the ideas that have come out

are good, innovational and musi-
cal.

I will also grant that many of
the things we hear on radio by
Rock groups is better than some
of the mediocre jazz and "seri-
ous" music on the market today.
But, does anyone in their right
mind think that Rock is an art
form?

There is no way that we can
define or determine what con-
stitutes an art form. in the eyes
of many, some of the most dis-
gusting aspects of the so—cailed
art world are truly works of art.
The American institution that is
called the Art Critic has praised
to the skies some absolutely
nauseating paintings and music
pieces. So, who is to say what
is good and what is bad?

The only criteria that we have
for determining the artistic worth
of anything is by looking at past
history and at the work itself.
Now, is the past history of Rock
that meritorious? No, but this
alone is not enough to downgrade
what is happening now.

Perhaps what is really occur-
ring here is that i am letting my
own prejudices show through.
if so, i apologize. But, loannot
help but question the way that
Pop has been "legitimized"sirn-
ply because the young market that
used to buy and support jazz has
now “turned on" to Rock and the
many young musicians that used
to be drawn to jazz are nowplay-
ing Rock. Whose fault is this?

The answer to this question
and to the question of “Artistic
Rock" must not and cannot be
answered by me. The only peo-
pic that can give the true pic-

.ture of this problem are you,‘

 the tutor. Panic

The orchestra has several outstanding tech-

niques which they employ frequently. one is "

the beautiful and floating pianlssimo, and anoth-
er is the gradual, very smooth and majestic
cresendo and decresendo usedso dramatical-
ly and done unlike any orchestra in the world.

A guest artist appearing with the Philadel-
phia must be on guard or he will hoover-
shadowed by the orchestra and its greatness.
One of the best examples was van Cliburn's
adequate performance a Rechmaninofl’s Piano
Concerto No. 2 on August a.

The orchestra's performance of Sibelius’
Symphony No. 2 pitifully outdid Ciiburn, and
their “Variations on a Theme by Handel" over-
powered the Mormon Choir's well done perfor-
mance of Brahsms' Requiem on Argust 26.
What i am driving at here is the Inequailed
finesse and perfection of this orchestra above
anything i have ever heard or expect to for
some time.

Rachmaninoff speaks

Rachmaninoff realized this when he brought
some of his later works to this country to be
premiered by Ormandy’s orchestra. At this
time he made a statement which Mr. Ormandy

i idolized Chaiiapin.

"He was my ideal, and when i thought of
composition i thought of song and of Chaiiapin.
Now he is gone. Today when Mhink d compos-
ing my thoughts turn to you, the greatest or-
chestra in the world. For this reason i dedi-
cate this, my newest composition to the mem-
bers of the Philadelphia orchestra, and to
your conductor, Eugene Ormandy.”

Rachmaninoif's words will ring true to you
as well when you attend a performance at Sara-
toga. Perfection is the word of the day, and
you will be seating yourself to an experience
which you will never forget. Make Saratoga one
of your "musts" next summer.

Don't forget that there are three highlights
in the performing arts this week. Peter, Paul
and Mary are at the Armory on Friday and
Mantovani is at the RPI Field House on Sat-
urday. Tickets available at VanCurier Music
store downtown. Above all, however, is State’s
