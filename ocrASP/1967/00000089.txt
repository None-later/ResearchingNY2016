Cleveland, president of the Student As-
sociation, is considering placing his
resignation before Central Council suits
us fine. However we would rather have
seen this action taken last spring when
controversy first arose, after disclosure
of certain issues caused many to doubt
his responsibility for the position.

Great contention also arose over
certain irregularities and illegalities
apparent in all elections held since
March. It was found that procedures
for self nomination. voting, and the
drawing up, and storing of ballots
were negligent; in some cases regula-
tions had been blatantly abused due
to the lack of an efficient Election Com-
mission. Bitterness followedr’

These irregularities were formally
presented in an election referral drawn
up by students Schwartz, Schnitzer, and
Upham on May 3, 1967. it demanded
invalidation of the 1967 MYSKANlA, class
officer, Central Council and Living Area
Affairs Commission elections, as well
as the election of Jeffrey Mishkin as
vice president of the Student Associa-
tion.

also advocated immediate re-elections
held under the auspices of a non-parti-
san organization. The ’66-'67 MYSKANIA
was then asked to restage certain (LAAC
It Popular Central Council) 'electlons;

in order to 'maintain strict legality/

'66-'67 MYSKANlA presented another
referral to the Supreme Court on some
voting technicalities. The Court handed
down a formal statement, stating,,among
other things, that the elections could not
be reheld unless the nominations pro-
cedures were also repeated. The follow-
ing day the_y refused to review their de-
cision which left matters up in the
air. Elections were never reheld.

elections cited remain technically in-

not withstand the set back. Therefore
we will honor the elections as such.

We urge Central Council to take im-
mediate steps to set up the non-parti-
san Election Commission demanded last /
year to help insure the validity of
elections. We would also like to see
the possibilities of using a voting ma-
chine investigated.

There will be no excuse for these
conditions to arise again this year,

Table Trouble

We were shocked to hear reports
from the SDS (Students for A Demo-
cratic Society)'people that they were
having trouble setting up their regu-
lar literature table in the campus cen-
ter this year. it seems they were in-
formed that because so many students
organizations were requesting table
space that table space was to be doled
out in two week time segments.

We feel this literature table is one
of the most vital things SDS can do to
make itself effective. The table is a
service to anyone who wants to obtain
'inexpensive literature of this nature.

Furthermore we think of the Campus
Center as such. It should be a center
for student organizations, and all the
card tables which can be accommo-
dated shouid be regardless of whe-
ther or not they enhance the interior.

    
   

  

It is our hope to see the SDS Litera-
ture Table installed in the lobby of the
Campus Center permanently, soon, and
to see an end to this type of foolish-
ness forever.

What happened in Albany this

ions or criminals.

What did happen on July as

and 27 was that two to three- 4“

hmdrsd black people in Albany
said "no" to snopprsssive de-
humanizing system personified
by white skinned people and in
particular by white Albany police-

men.

The incident tint set at the
two day rebellion was like thou-
sands d incidents that take
place in this country daily. A
Black American, ln things},
aeyoung woman, was bullied by
a police dflcer.

But instead (I getting away
with this treatment 'on this day,
the policeman was suddenly sur-
rounded by s crowd of black
youths who had witnessed the in-
cident. 0n the previous week
in the same area a black youth
had been struck by a policeman
during an argument about the
policeman’s lack of courtesy
towards a woman.

Again the police immediately
sought to use violence to es-
tablish their authority. The young
woman was taken away tobebook-
ed for disorderly cmduct and four
policemen tried to break up the
crowd by brandishing their clubs
and using them on the legs of
those who were slow in getting
out of the way.

The news of the trouble was
relayed to the office of'I‘he Broth-
ers, a black power group which
has existed in Albany for about
one year. By the time they reach-
ed the scene, The Brothers found

In: rem Pollal,'Edt'tor, AzBA/vy LIBERA 7'0}?

ipprosimately 20 patrol car-
losds of police facing a crowd
(I arolmd 100 persons made up
mostly d, teen-nus.

As it was later described by

one of The Brothers, their so-

tials were instinctive. They saw
the kids with bricks and bottles
and the police with their guns

wn.
By joining hands and getting
in between the police and the
youths, The Brothers were able
to push the crowd back and pre-
vent the inevitable slaughter. Lat-
er they held a meeting and drew
up a list of demands which they
intended to present the next day.

This was Wednesday night. On
Thursday The Brothers with
some area clergy visited the
acting police chief to present
their demands. The conces-
sions granted were minor —
the youths would have to come to
the chief's dfice; he would not go
listen to them. The mayor, nor
any other city official made any
attempt to find out what was need-
ed or even listen to the young
people.

That night with no sign that
justice was available in Albany,
the youths, now joined by some
older men, kept the police up
all night protecting store win-
dows and motorists in the down-
town ares of the city. .

The police arrested some 40
persons, but morning brought an
end to the rebellion. The police
did not re-estahlish “law and
order;" becauav may do not stand
for law and order, but for vio-
lence and oppression. in Albany,
as in those 50 or 60 other cities,
the long, hot summer is over — ‘
but the struggle for freedom is
not over — it has just begun.

 

 

COMMENT

by William M. Leue

 

 

At the end of last year, a mild
controversy arose concerning
voting irregularities and other
shenanignas during the elections
for Central Council. The most
colorful incident was a coulom-
plated (but not realized) essay
into ballot-box stuffing by the
then Chairman of Central Coun-
cil.

Although this somewhat roman-
tic escapade titilated the fancies '
of many campus residents, the
serious observers of student poll-
tics were rather more concerned
with the whole atmosphere of
neglect and careless indifference
which permeated the whole elec-
tion process.

Unfortunately, the general stu-
dent body expressed anutter lack
of interest in the affair. Even
when the Albany Student Press
examined in detail the whole
comedy of errors, including also;
tlons supervised only by the can-
didates on the ballots, and the
incredible number of offices se-
cured by the members and fellow-
travelers of a single campus
fraternity, the public reaction
was a deafening sigh of indif-
ference. .

Why this massive dishitarest
in the way Student Association
is run? Does the difficulty lie in
the general student body, or in
the way Student Association is
constituted and run, or both?

The answer, i think, is some-
what complicated. lt is not true
that Central Council's duties and
powers are insignifigant. The
student Tax monies are measur-
ed ln tens of thousands ofdollars
annually, and go tosupport awide
variety of services; the news-
paper, athletlcs, entertainment,
lectures, and so on.

Obviously, students should be

First, Central Council is far
too much a creature of special
interests: the campus news

The constitution is written so as
to give these interests enigma.

portionate voice in the Council,
and far too much of theCouncil’s
time is taken up with adminis-
trative detail concerning the bud-
geting of funds for these various
campus activities.

To be sure, this work must be
done, but it should not be the
Council's major job. Central
Council could, and should be a
major center of innovation and
creative conflict on campus.

Central Council itself should
be initiating the questions, the
complaints. issues like the Draft,
University housing policies, stu.
dent conduct rules, academic re-
quirements, and Albany politics
are of concern to S.U.N.Y.A.
students, whether they know it

Schlesinger's book also

liilsman is a political scientist,
And, like Schlesinger, he was
drawn from the academic com-
munity into the administration.
His first job was as Director of
the Bureau oflntelligence and Re-
search in the State Department;
later he became Assistant Sec~
reiary of State for Far Eastern
Affairs.

Hilsman had an inside view of
many decisions, and his second
position involved him with the
early decisions made in Viet-
nam. He was much more closely
involved than Schlesinger in the
day-lo-day workings of the
government.

As the title states, Hilsman
concerns himself with the way in
which policy is decided. His
central thesis is that policy de-

clsions are often a struggle both
within the government and in the
general public to have a certain
viewpoint adopted as policy.

This struggle works in many
ways. important issues are de-
bated ln the press, and public
opinion must be heeded by Con-
gress and the President. Various
factions exist in Congress using
their influence over legislative
and budgetary matters to have
their viewpoints heeded.

Powerful lobbies and special
interest groups try to stir up
approval or rejections of specific
policy alternatives. And within
the government itself, certain
factions try tohave their opinions
turned into policy.

An interesting activity upon
which Hilsman places great em-
phasis is the process of "leak-
ing" inside information to the
press as a way of forcing a
certain course of action to be
developed or squelched. Often
the information is distorted or
presented in an unfavorable
manner to embarass certain
officials.

als “who were convinced that we
were losing the war and that it
would get worse if we continued

berstam, Browne, or Sheehan.
Those who felt we were winning,
or had a stake in feeling wewere
winning, and wanted to go on sup-
porting Diem leaked to Mar-
guerite Higgins on her visits, or
to Alsop, or to one of the Hearst
reporters.”

All rights and power belong to a

Howard officials expelled 16
students and five faculty mem-

apparently because of their
political involvement last year.
The US. Court of Appeals has
ordered Howard to ro-admit four

Mirror/Valuable Than Schlesinger

One of the minor tragedies inﬂicted upon this nation by John F.'1(ennedy's death
is the loss of the person who would best be able to write the history of his ad-
ministration. Several members of his administration and staff
written their remembrances of the period.

Arthur Schlesinger's account, “A Thousand Days,” focused mainly on foreign
affairs, With only brief sections devoted to domestic politics. Schlesinger’s

have already

sources of these leaks. He points
out that most of the people in-
volved in the process sincerely
believed that their position was
correct. They were merely pres-
suring the government into the
proper decision.

Hilsman also analyzes the
structure and workings of the
State Department and the per-
sonalities involved at the higher
echelons of policy-making. He
shows how Kennedy struggled
to make the State Department
work more efficiently and quick-

ly. .

Hilsman focuses his attention
on only a few areas where major
policy decisions were taken to
show the struggle in the govern-
ment and the pressures lhatwere
placed upon it. He gives a good
historical background for each
area, then describes the crisis
and the policy decisions affect-
ing it.

Avoiding bias is not always
easy, but Hilsman presents the
facts of a crisis in an objective
manner, showing the reasons for
disagreement. He deals with
Laos, Cuba, the Congo, China,
Indonesia, and Vietnam and
analyzes the reasons for conﬂict.

The longest treatment is given
to Vietnam in an attempt to ex-
plain the reasons for getting in-
volved in the first place and why
we are still stuck there. His
account is the most objective
view of administration policies
that l have encountered.

No understanding of Vietnam
especially, or foreign policy. in
general, can be complete without
reading Hllsman’s book.
