This year, for the first time swimming will be added
to the intercollegiate athletic program. The schedule, de-
signed for both men and women, will be carried out on a
club basis. in charge of the men’s swimming program is
Mr'. Brian V. Kelly who did his doctoral work at lndiana
University, the school generally recognized as the col-
legiate swimming power of’tb’e nation. The pool will be
located in the new.gym, scheduled tobeready October 15.
Some of the other features of the new gym which might be
considered “progress” when compared to Page which
reminded one of an armpit'more than a gymnasium are a
three court length. basketball floor, a swimming pool, a
large wrestling room, and for the ladies, a mirror lined
modern dance room. These are, just a few of the several
modern improvements the gym has to offer. Convenience
being another point worth mentioning - Whether you
consider the gym to be in Albany, Guilderland, or
Colonie, the fact remains it's only minutes from the new
quads. -

Thanks to the new gym, tournaments will be coming to
our own front door..The formal dedication of the gym will
be highlighted by consecutive basketball doubleheaders on
December 1' and 2. The teams involved are new to the
SUNYA» hoop schedule and no doubt provide big time com-
petition. The annual four team Capital City Basketball
Tournament will be played in the new gym, taking the
tournament away from its previous site, Siena's Gibbons
Hall. That in itself is a moral victory.

As is swimming, track will go intercollegiate one club
basis this year. R.Keith Munsey, alegend in his own time
at Albany, will be handling track while another coach will
be handling only the field events. Whereas the track club
did perform last year, it is the maiden season for the

' field competitors. Since both swimming and track are
being run on a club basis, freshman and transfers are
eligible to compete.

The Great Danes were
first on the scoreboard
in the Brooklyn encoun-
ter, scoring when. at 7:35
of the first period, Hab-
teh-Yimer took a pass
from Kahn and drove it
off the goalie’s hands and
into the nets.

Swartout upped the
count to 2-0, when at 17:55
of the second riod he
took a pass from teh-Ylmer
and fired the ball past the goalie.

Coach Garcia started to sub-
stitute in the second half, and
latein the third period Brook-
lyn scored to close the gap to
2-1, but the Great Danes tight-
ened their defense, and a score-
less fourth quarter resulted in
the win.

Jerry Leggieri's 12 saves and
the excellent play of the whole
fullback line of Jursak, La Reau,
John Compeau and Roger Saul
were the game's most promis-
ing developments.

The Great Danes opened their
home schedule on Wednesday
when they hosted the Red Drag-
ons of Oneonta in agame which
unfortunately came just after
our deadline and thus can not be
reported here.

Tomorrow the hooters travel
to Bridgeport for a return en-
gagement with this East Coast
soccer power. Last year the
Great Danes fell to them by a
4-0 count. "

Coast Guard “Wins X -Country,
Albany’s Roy Finishes First

by Tom Nixon

NEW LONDON — The Albany State Cross Country team, coached by R.l(.
Munsey, suffered its first loss Saturday as they were edged by the Coast Guard
Academy, 25-32. This. loss was the first time that the barriers have ever lost
their first meet of the year. Despite the setback, however, Munsey was not die-
couraged as he received outstanding performances from sophomore Paul Roy of
Fulton and Mike Attwell a junior from Herkimer as they placed first and second
respectively. in addition to these two, senior Joe Keatlng and Junior Paul Breslin
and Don Beevers all turned in performances which portend a strong potential
regardless of their relatively low finish in this particular meet. Bob Mulvey,
last year's most improved runner, didn't finish in the top five, but Munsey
expects him and Jim Keating, one of last year's best freshmen, both to be
challenging for top spots in future meets.

Siudeni Gov.

To Be Form ed
By Grads

During the past summer the
graduate students of the Uni-
versity began to organize a gov-

. ernment of their own.

This government will be form-
ed parallel io the undergradu-
ate Central Council. Graduate

' Students will still be members
of Student Association.

The movement beganeariy last
year with the Circle Twenty Club.
This organization was composed
of a few graduate students who
wished to gather for social func-
tions.

With the encouragement of the
deans of students and other mem-
bers of the University Commu-

9 nity these few graduates decided
to explore the possibilities of
their own government.

Keyed iinq, leader of the grad-
uate students, stated at the week-
ly President’s Conference with
Students Monday that it is plan-
ned to have the graduate gov-
ernment divided along the lines
of the different schools.

Each school would have its
own commission type of govern-
ment and send representatives
to a graduate student council.

The council is planned to be
. composed of representatives of

Marijuana Discussed
At Pres. Conference

Formal University policy on
Student narcotics usage was a
main topic of discussion at Mon-
day's President’s Coni'erenccfor
Students.

Students queried us to the Uni—
versity’s actions when u stu-
dent is a known user of drugs,
and whether being arrested on
n narcotics charge would affect
their status in the University.
Others were concerned over poli—
cy on allowing narcotics agents
to infiltrate student body 5e
cretly.

President Evan ll. Collins an-
swered that there is no hard
and fast policy, and this policy
applies to all offenders of local,
state, or federal law. Each case
must be considered as an entity
in itself.

The University will consider

problems": the individual is the
first concern.

it is also brought into con-
sideration which services of the
University, especially in legal
matters, can be brought to bear
to help such cases.

Students are judged as to
whether a certain offence would
necessarily lead to a discontinu-
ance of studies, and if the stu-
dent health or welfare will be
endangered.

Finally the formal policy states
that they must uphold the exist-
ing laws, however, consider!»
tion of the other stipulations most
often lead to decisions in favor
of the student.

The Administration does not
condone, or allow any secret
agents to infiltrate the student
body.

Members Review

Myskania’s Role

The 67-68 MYSKANIA, in its
first meeting, Oct. 1, disoussed
its objectives in the light of
its past history and the posi-
tion it now holds in the Univer-
sity.
MYSKANLA'S constitutional
roles are (l) a screening com-
mittee for the nominees for
Supreme Court, (2) guardian of
tradition and (3) guardian of the
freshman class. She also has the
power "to assist Central Council
and the University in formulating
aims and objectives of the Uni-
versity and to aid in interpret-
ing these aims and objectives to
the student body and toihe broad-
er community as a whole."

it was this later House on
which the discussion centered.
MYSKANIA considered that
there is a need on campus to
bring issues of major concern
from small group discussion to
the University as in whole.

in‘ this way they full that ut-
icntion would be focused on such
issues so that University-wide
discussion and action would re-
sult.

VOL. LIV. N0. 2

ClevelandPredicted

by John Cromie

Tonight Central Council is ex-
pecting to hear the resignation
of William T. Cleveland as Pres
ident of Central Council. it was
announced by Jeffery Mishkin,
vice president of Student Asso-
cliation, at last week's meeting
that Cleveland had not yet time
to write his resignation, but
that he will present it before
the next meeting.

If the resignation is madc- out,
it will be up to Central Council
to act upon it. Cleveland will
be the first president of Central
council to leave office in this
manner, if he does resign.

In the absence of Cleveland,
Mlshkin presided in the chair-
man's seat last meeting. Under
the rules of Central Council Misfi-
kin would become president im-
mediately at the acceptance of
the resignation.

The resignation has been ru-
mored since the beginning of
school. At first the rumor
stated that the resignation would
be announced at the Convocation
ceremonies. When that rumor
didn't materalize another popped
up. The second rumor was to
the effect that the resignation
would be presented at the next
Central Council meeting. it Was
at this meeting that Mishkln made
the announcement.

If Cleveland does leave his
post as President of Central
Council he does not have toleave
his seat on the council. Cleve-
land ls one of the two members
of council from Community Pro-
gramming Commission the other
representative is James Win—
slow.

if Mlshkin does ascend to the
presidency the chair of vice
president will be left vacant.
Presumably an election will be
held for the vice presidency as
soon as it is vacated, if it is
vacated.

The council consists of 26
members at the present. Aside
from Cleveland only Mishkln and
Mr. Niel Brown, director of Stu-
dent Activities have had at least
a year of experience on the coun-
cil. A handful of others have
been council members for asem-

To ResignTonight

ester. The majority of members
are sitting on Central Council
for the first time.

At the present time the
members are in a"state oilimbo.‘
They are not sure who will lead
council and conduct the business
of the Student Association.

According to James Kahn,
council member, Cleveland is
causing problems because he
isn’t acting as president and he
hasn’t resigned as of yet. The
constitution states that the vice
president can take over the duties
of the president at the top execu-
tive’s request.

In hopes of eliminating the
problems caused by past elec-
tions Central council passed a
new election bill last year. Ap-
pointed to be chairman of Elec-
tion Committee was Douglas Up
ham. Upham, presently a gradu-
ate student, was arepresentative
on Central Council from Com-
munications Commission during
the last two years.

The Central Council meeting
is open to' the public. If any
student or other person wish-

es he may come to the meet-
ing tonight. The session is to
be called to order at 7:30 in
Humanities 123. it has been hop-
ed by members of Central Coun-
cil that the student body will
take a greater interest in the af-
fairs of the government.

 

WILLIAM ’l‘. CLEVELAND

Representatives Removed:

Unfulfilled Residence

Two members were removed
from their seats on Central
Council last Thursday night be—
cause they no longer fulfill the
residence requirements. Reps.
Victor Loopei‘ and Craig T.
Springer were elected to rep”
resent State Quad last spring.
Loopcr lives at Dutch Quad, and
Springer is an Alumni Quad.

Looper was moved by the Uni.
versity from State Quad to his
president residence in Stuyvesant
Tower. Springer look if Residence
Assistance at Alumni Quud. Both
students thought that they would
be living ill State when they run
for the office lust May.

The rational behind the ex-
pulsion is sluied In Article 2
section :3 c of the Constitution
of the Student Association of the
State University of New York
at Albany. The section states:

‘Studont Association shall elect
members to Central Council in
the ruiio of four hundred to one,
or the nearest whole thereof.
The basis of representation shall
be living areas, including both
on - and off - campus gi'onpings.’

During the Last Meeting at bill

 

was made to create two special
ab-large seats on the council.
One for Looper and the other
for Springer. Alter extended dis-
cussion the comicil defeated the
measure.

The council also approved an
expenditure of $250 to pay for
a sculpture that was stolen last
year. The sculpture was part
of an exhibit held in the Campus
Center by the Arts Board. The
value of the piece was placed
by Robert Totorlcl, sculpture.

Central Council also approved
the expenditure of $3,000 for
lniermedia '68, Festival for New
York State. This festival, spon~
sored by Community Pro-
gramming Commission, will in
cludc 12 artists (or groups).
These people will present
examples of their own section of
the arts. They hope to reach
an audience who has not exper-
ienced the aspects of the arts.

The council postponed its in-
vestigation of the summer ASP,
until tonight. As that time lini'old
Lynn, editor-ln-chici' of the '67
Summer ASP will be present to
answer questions.
