Wedow Exhibit
On Display Now
At Albany Inst.

The Albany Institute oinstory
and Art is honoring the memory
oi the late Clinton, New York
sculptor, Rudy Wedow, by a re-
trospective exhibition which
opens on Tuesday, October 3.

Born in Buffalo, Wedow studied
at the Albright Art GalierySchooi
of Fine Arts, the BerkshireSum-
mer School, Syracuse University,
and with numerous artists such
as Emmy Zweybruck of Vienna
and John Tatschl of New Mexico.

The exhibit consists of about
40 sculptures spanning the 30
years prior to his death at the
age of 52 in 1965.

Two directions or styles seem
to characterize the artist’swork:
a fascination with plants, seeds,
and pods leadingto strongly deco-
rative metal interpretations of
these forms worked inweldedand
brazed steel, bronze, and copper.

Some are small enough for
table display while others are out-
door pieces suitable for gardens
or backyards. in this direction.
the metal bugs are actualiewelry
frequently worn on coats and
sweaters.

Wedow also collected metal
scraps and salvaged parts from
junk yards. Thesewere fashioned
into sculptures sometimes ab-
stract but usually based on
recognizable subjects.

Albanians lending to the ex-
hibit include Mrs. John Cogge-
shall, Mr. and Mrs. Hyman Nov-
lotzky, Mrs. David E.
Williamson.

Marion Bellamy Wedow, the
sculptor's widow has made the
bulk of the collection availableto
the Albany institute. Museums
lending include Bennington and

Albany Bus Strike
First Since 1946

by Ellis Pearson

Albany's striking bus drivers
and mechanics are concerned
with the most basic labor-
management issue there is: they
want more money.

Strikers on the picket line at
the United Traction Company's
Quail Street Garage did not feel
any animosity towards the com-
pany; they pointed out that the
union had not called a strike
since 1946. They felt, however,
that $2.50 per hour wage they had
received before the strike was
not sufficient; one striker pointed
down the street toward Frei-
hofer’s Bakery, and said “girls
there get as much as $3.00 an
hour, and they don't have to pilot
a bus around."

The pickets, members of divi-
sion 1321, Amalgamated ransit
Employees Association, claimed
to be "100 per cent behind the
union," and said that they would
accept the union’s decision on a
settlement. Strikers will receive
about $25 a week, starting to-
morrow, from the union's strike
fund. Members are falling back

on their savings; one picket said,
"it's tough to get an outside lob;
nobody will hire you when they
known you'll quit and go back to
the bus company when the strike
is over."

The workers don't anticipate
a long strike, but are unwilling to
estimate its probable length.

' Several drivers expressed hope

that the wage issue might be
resolved —— and that they might
be back behind the wheel -— after
the October 2 meeting between the
union and management.

During the strike the Uni-
versity has managed to continue
to transport students even though
United Traction Company buses
are used. The University has four
buses of its own which began the
route earlier in the hour and
were spread out.

independent buses have also
been rented by the University
temporarily. Food Service and
other aspects of the University
affected by the strike have co-
operated to try to make thirus
as easy as possible during its
transportation problem.

At Gol den'Eye

Tomorrow at9 a.m., the Golden
Eye opens a new season of 5 cent
donuts and contemporary involv-
ment. The Eye, a Friday night
coffee house dedicated to bring-
ing programs of discussion, in-
formation and entertainment to
the Albany State community, has
been operating every week for
several seasons.

This year's first program will
be an evening of folk music as
performed by several 1 students
and groups from State and sur-
rounding schools. The perform-
ers include Ed Silver singing
some blues and some original,
Tim Atwell, singing his own ma~
terial, Stu Soloman and Neil Lin-
don playing old fashion bluegrass,
Andy Negal singing original and
folk, and several others.

The program, and all future
programs are back in the same
old place as in previous years,
the basement of the Madison
Avenue Presbyterian Church at
820 Madison Ave. This is between
Ontario and Quail Streets, five
minutes from the Alumnai Quad
and half a block from Yezzl's.

Golden Eye programs in the
past have ranged from panel dis-
cussions on civil rights, politics,
the role of the university, and
various literary trends, to the
staging of one act plays, folk
music and jazz nights. to the

,Dra‘ma Council

For Frosh Skit

A Freshmen Drama Council
was formulated by the Freshmen
Drama Council for the direction
and production of a Freshmen
Play. The group is working on a
musical sketch of one or two
acts.

Jay Hershkowitz, the new pre-
sident of the Council, will be the
producer, and David Wood will
handle direction. Steve Hersh
and Dave are uniting their re-
sources to compose the play hook
and an appropriate musical
score.

Rehearsals for 70 interested
Freshmen will begin on Oct. 18
in Brubacher Lower Lounge.
Tenative plans have scheduled
two performances on the con-
secutive days before Thangsgiv-
ing Recess with specific times
to be announced at a later date.

showing of movies of more than
common interest.

.The programs are selected by
a steering committee ofinterest.
ed students. The Eye is one of
the few independent student
organizations on campus, accepI-.
ing neither funds nor direction
from student government. its pro-

' grams are. normally free and are

always open to all interested
persons.

Future plans for the coming
year include a possible staging
of the controversial play Mac~
Bird, and more expensive donuts.

The members of the Eye steer-
ing committee expressed a wish
that any additional students wish-
ing to perform tomorrow bring
their instruments along.

Council
Investigates
Lynne Tonight

Tonight Central Council will
investigate the miscarriage of the
1967 Summer ASP. Harold Lynne,
who was elected editor-in-chlef
for the summer, is scheduled to
appear before the council this
evening. The investigation was
prompted by the fact that no ASP
did not appear last summer.

Issuance of the newspaperd
ing the summer was to have-been
mainly on an experimental basis.
Lynne hoped to try several
different techniques in printing
the paper. With this experience,
Lynne was to begin as co-edltor
in chief of the fall ASP using the
best methods found during the
summer experiment.

Although all expenditures have
been accounted for there is a
question as to if the expendi-
tures are "justified."

Lynne is not presently enroll-
ed as a student of theUnIverslty.
He was elected as co-editor-ln-
chief since it was. expected i?

would enroll in the graduu.
school.

“If love does make it (the
sexual set) right, then, does it
follow that love is all one needs?"
Reverend William Small believes
more than love is needed to
make pre-muritai relutiohs all
right.

lie has been in love "about
126 times" and may be, in the
future, in love many moreiimes.

“One needs a commitment,
whether you call it marriage or
not; a conimiiinent, heart und
soul, to another human being."

Reverend Small admits that
women view sex differently than
men do. “For the woman the sex
act is u symbol of a relation-
ship." The question was asked
if that relationship, however, be
bigger and deeper in the future?

To clarify his point, the Rev-
erend mentioned u popular song
Illustrating this “Will You Still
Love Me Tomorrow," altitude.

“Yes,” Reverend Small said,
“love does make it right, but
first make sure ii is love. The
commiiiiieut, body and soul and
all; in deep genuine and lasting
relationship — thui's what makes
it right."

Dr. Litilefieid feels there are
differeni kinds of commitments;
that the New Morality has re-
sulth from the changes in phys-

Discussed, Questioned

iologicai facts and new contra-
ceptive methods. 1 .

"llunian relationships involve
the need for openness. if we
think something will last for-
ever, we will be brought to
realize that nothing does last
forever, that feelings always
change. i don't think one can pre-
dict what he is going to feel in
40 years, 20 yours or 20i'20nths,
from now."

Morality in reference to a sex-
ual act is no different from oth-
er ncts. Moral nets in all fields,
feels Dr. Litilefieid, involves a
"recognition of responsibility."

"in shaking hands you must
be responsible for your gestures
whether you feel them or not."
So it is with ihe sex act.

in agreemeni with Reverend
Small, Liltlefield said that "Sex
must grow into a deep and gen-
uine relationship and it will not
last unless it keeps growing and
changing. it is important for peo-
ple to feel free to nccepi the re-
sponsibility for this kind of rela-
tionship and take the consequen-
ces" should it not work out.

in the question and answer
period Littlefleld reiterated his
idea that “no feeling lasts for-
ever in reference in love."This,

 

however, is not to say that love
can't last, but that the snme feel-
ingsican't lest. "Feelings are
mobile."

Reverend Small, rather in op-
position to Dr. Litilefieid, said
that, "a refusal to make a com-
mitment is tantamount to anul-
ling ihe deep relationship’ ' he had
talked about previously. The high
rate of divorce, he pointed out,
however, illustrates that peo-
ple do grow apart and feelings
do change. Divorces come about,
believes the Reverend, where
people thought they were.in love
and really weren't.

“it is easy for young people
to be disturbed about statistics"
having to do with divorce rates.
“But there are the rich mar-
riages of very many people."

Littlefleld admitted that "it
is very hard for the coed now.
The pressure is on to put-out.
The pill and all kinds of tech-
nology makes it easier to put-
out. But there is damage done
(to herself) when she does, ex-
cept when she has that kind of
relationship" involving a deep
and genuine-love.

Father Paul Smith summed up
the lecture by saying that the
friendships we make here at the
University will be brought into
our future relationships and en-
hance them.
