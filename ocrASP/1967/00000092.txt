We are extremely concerned over one
aspect of a growing narcotics problem
both on the campus and in the nation,
specificale the problem of the marijuana
user. By concerned we do not mean con-
cern over an alleged increase in the num-
ber of users, but concern for any mari-
juana users who get 'busted.’

'Busted,’ the ugly word with the big
‘8’. Although marijuana (a non-narcotic
member of the hemp family) is not ac-
tually s~narcotic it is defined as such
by the Federal Uniform Narcotics Act,
and'subsequentiy in New York and other
state laws. The law as such fails to make
a differation between marijuana, and the
addictive or ‘hard’ narcotics such as opi-
ates or barbituates.

Therefore, anyone in possession of,
or trafficking in marijuana is in viola-
tion of the State and Federal governments.
Even a one-time or occasional user is
subject to these rulings. People elect-
ing to use marijuana are subject to
harassment from all sides of the law.
A great worry to users is the Federal
Narcotics Agent infiltrating their midst.

Most' medical defense of marijuana
is now common knowledge. it is non-
addictive and does not lead to physical
dependence, it also has a very low toler-
ation level, (bodily need (if greater amounts
of a substance to produce a greater ef-
fect). Medical reports consider it less
dangerous and habit forming than alco-
hol or smoking tobacco.

We feel that marijuana should be leg-
alized on the grounds of the known med-
ical evidence and for the rights 'of an
individual as a citizen. It could be dis-
tributed through certain agencies under
regulation and be made available only to
certain age groups.

it is not enough simply to take mari-
juana out of classification as a narcot-
ic, where it has no right to be in the
first place. There would still be law
offenders, and busts, and lots of flak,
although a revision of this classifica-
tion and an adjustment of punishment
are a must if it is not legalized.

Many people say ‘Legalize pot, legal-
ize heroin.’ They fear the effect of wide-
spread use of marijuana, and picture a so-
ciety something like the 'Lotus Eaters.’
They feel it is not ethical to campaign
for another source of escape "detri-
mental to the good of society."

We realize that a greater availability
of marijuana would probably lead to a
greater number of users,.hut because
of, the nature of the animal we do not
feti marijuana users are any worse than

people who drink. People argue that it
may become a psychological crutch for
some, but then so are the more danger-
ous alcohol, cigarettes and tranquilizers.

We feel that if someone elects to smoke
marijuana either occasionally or habitual-
ly it should be within their legal right to
do so. The peace of mind and future of
too many people are being endangered
under the present laws. To us' it is a
matter of individual libert .

 

Joint Power

 

Although students at the University com-
plain about the lack of protest and ac-
tion in truly "liberal" veins, there seems
to be a pitiful lack of awareness of how
liberal some of our standards are with
respect to other universities.

A ’Joint Statement on Rights and Free-
doms of Students’ unanimously passed
this summer at the National Student As-
sociation (NSA) Congress called for stu-
dent control of chartering and financing
of student organizations and activities;
the right to establish dormitory. social
and housing rules, and “Authority over
disciplinary actions resulting from vio-
lations of student regulations."

Anyone informed about our policies
will realize that all these demands are
already part of students rights in our
University policy. We already have a
great deal of what other schools must
now resolve and fight to have.

The second area of the resolution deals
with joint control of students with the ad-
ministration and faculty. The NSA resolu-
tion favored joint control in areas of
admission, course requirements, and
grading policies; in the hiring and firing
of the faculty; and in determining col-
lege services.

At present we do not have these things
at the Univsrsity, and these are going to
be the issues for an aware student to
fight for. The whole concept of joint con-
trol requires a radical change in Uni-
versity thinking.

in mid-October we are expecting to
hear the formal report of the Univer-
sity's Committee on Undergraduate Edu-
cation. At this time many matters of
policy will be open to change, and discus-
sion.

A University of this size, and with
this much to- work with, should be a
leader for really revolutionary con-
cepts, such as joint power. in the Uni-
versity. '

Now is the perfect opportunity for
student mobilization; all students should
acquaint themselves with joint power and
then start c m n “for 'whatv'they'
want. 4. it till nit"

an event, its historyrbecomesr
more and more established, un-

version of what place. if
there is any evidsaeetochallenge

the official version, it must come '
,from the event itself, no matter

when it is discovered. a
in the history of the Newark

'and Detroit riots, the official

and accepted version is that Na.
tional Guardsmen were brought
into these cities not merely to
prevent looting and burning, but
to combat “snipers” and "open
rebellion.”

On this pretext the death toll
in Newark went from 5 to 23
after the Guard entered the city.
in Detroit, the death toll jumped
from 19 to 43.

Tom Hayden, a SDS community
organizer in Newark, told the
incredible tale of “The Occu-
pation of Newark" in the August
24 “New York"Rsview of Books.
Hayden states:

ll‘An evaluation of the deaths
so far reported suggests that the
military forces killed people for
the purposes of terror and in-
timidation. Nearly all the dead
were killed by police, troopers,
and Guardsmen. The 'crimes
of the victims were petty, vague,
or unproven. None were accused
by police of being snipers;only
one so far is alleged to have
been carrying a gun."

Did the threat of snipers and
rebellion justify such a display
of violence? How dangerous ac-
tually were the snipers?
According to Hayden:

"’l‘here were 3000 National
Guardsmen, 1400 Newark police,
500 state troopers, and several
hundred firemen who were stand-

' ing and riding in the open during

til one day, there is an official ,

the lot. They were .eiqlosed, it
w claimed, to a 'withering
sniper fire.’ With a pistol, and
certainly with arier anamateur
sniper could» have killedsa‘verai
soldiers;- But only, one policeman
and one fireman were killed. . .
Both were described as sniper

  

' victims, 'although .they were

caught in the middle of police
fire, and no one knew even the
direction from which the snipers
were shooting." I

if one accepts Hayden’s account
of the behavior of the guard in
Newark (and the accounts of the
Detroit Free Press on the un-
necessary deaths in Detroit), the
use of the Guard in these situa.
tions can be seen as little more
than a further incitement to vio-
lence. Nevertheless, National
Guard units all over the country
are receiving special riot train-

huge

Whether as a response to a
gang of teenagers breaking into
or burning stores or as a re-
sponse to a small unorganized
number of snipers (whose role
at one point in the Newark riot
was to divert police from the
looters by firing into the air),
the uncontrolled, inhuman vio-
lence of the National Guard was
inexcusable.

If one realizes that the amount
of armed resistance that oc-
curred this summer was minute
and totally unorganized, the
future looks gium.

The danger is that the re-
sponse to training the Guard may
be the arming and training of
black people to defend them--
selves. Ghetto residents who feel
that this country's repo'nse to
their desperate situation is more
repression have no other re-
course than resistance.

 

 

 

COMMUNICATIONS

 

 

To the Editor:

The first issue of the "new"
ASP was impressive in several
ways. As a long-time managing
editor and a former co-editor-
ill-chief of Albany State's student
paper, l want to congratulate the
editor and her staff.

The new printer and the new
arrangements are obviously an
improvement. The new banner
with the gray background is im-
pressive.

The move from twice a week
is hopefully a temporary change.

The amount of solid news and
the good use of both features and
editorials was very interesting.

While the emphasis was main-
tained on the Students, news of
the faculty and news from outside
the University which has impact
on its community was included—
very good.

The arts page is again astand-
out. The inclusion of a calendar
is useful. -

One last compliment—the
white on black headlines on the
editorials are a success in as
much as they help make that
page appear different from the

other pages. Distinctive pages
and sections—a distinctive and
good paper.

l hope the supply of money does
not run out for the ASP, as
the arrangements whereby st .-
dents are no longer doing paste-
ups is the way it should have
been all along.

Again, if it has not been clear
so far, you're off to a good start,
keep up the good work. You,
your staff and the University
are bound to benefit from your

Plans Now U

nder Way

For Anti-War March

by Ed Silver

On Saturday, Oct. 21, Wash-
ington, D.C. will become the
- seas of what may prove to be

' be largest peace demonstration
in this country's history.

All Americans [desiring a
change in President Johnson's
Vietnam policy are being asked
to mobilize in the Capital on this
day to voice en masse their re-
pudiation of an “unjustified and
futile war."

At the University campus, or-
ganization for the March has been
proceeding since late this past
summer. The Student Mobiliza-
tion Committee to End the War
was contacted in Manhattan by
several students and has supplied

.posters, handouts and informa-
tion for use on campus.

information Desk

All information desk has been
organized in the lobby of the Stu-
dent Center by university stu-
dents. All students expecting to
attend the march are being ask-
ed to register with this desk.
Anyone interested in bus trans-
portation to and from Washing-
ton at reduced charter rates
($ll.50 round trip) are asked
to inquire at the desk, as well

.as those interested in establish-
ing cat- pools, either as drivers
or as passengers.

The desk is being operated
under the sponsorship of two in-
dependent campus organizations:
Freedom Council and the Tri-
City Student Alliance. These
groups are composed ofinterest-
ed SUNYA students and have no
outside affiliations.

The Student Mobilization Com-
mittee, supplying their lit-
erature, is a national student
coalition organized last April
to help coordinate student par-
ticipation in the April Mobiliza-
tions in New York and aroundthe

’country.

Last March

Last Spring, a bus of Univer-
sity students and numerous car-
loads carried an Albany State
contingent to the April lath
March. Participants have esti-
mated the Albany representation

at between 150-200.

This October's Mobilization is
in many ways similar to the April
March, but it also goes further
in its aims. The Mobilization will
I include a major march andrally.

The March will originate at
two points: the Washington Monu-
ment and the Lincoln Memorial.
They will being tomarchtowards
the Pentagon at 11 a.m., and
shall converge by 2:30 p.m. in
the Pentagon South parking lot.
A rally will follow.

Unlike the April 15 March, how-
ever, the protest shall not end
with this rally, but shall con-
tinue as an estimated 10,000 di-
rect action marchers shall then
attempt to disrupt the Pentagon
war machine by blocking entran-
ces and exits to the building, and
by entering and sitting down in
building rooms and corridors.

Further Demonstrations

On Sunday, October 22nd, fur-
ther demonstrations shall con-
tinue before the Pentagon. These
continue into Monday as direct
action people continue to attempt
disruption techniques.

Prof. Sidney Peck, Co-Chalr-
man of the National Mobilization
Committee which is planning the
march writes as follows in
answer to why it is felt that di-
rect action techniques are neces-
sary at this‘time:

"Because marches, vigiis,let-
ter writing and electoral activi-
ties have not been enough. John-
son and Co. have been escalat-
ing their barbarous war and they
are now bombing in the center of
Hanoi and Haiphong. Many Ameri-
cans feel that more has to be
done. if the U.S. military will
not get out of Vietnam, then
many people with their own bod-
ies will disrupt the war ma-
chine." (Vol. 2 - No. 2 Mobiliz-
er Mag. of the National Mobil-
ization Comm.)

The Albany contingent has sev-
eral volunteers who shall risk
certain arrest by joining the
blockade of the Pentagon. The
rest 'of the March rally will be
held far enough away from the
building to differenciate between
marchers and direct action peo-
ple.

 

 

A Piece Of The Sheet

 

 

Wednesday, Sept. 27, a resolu-
tion to change the established
rush procedure was introduced
and discussed. The mainchanges
in procedure would be the slim-
ination of fall and informal rush-
es; upperclassmen would rush
from the first day of the fall
semester until bids came out in
the spring; and Freshmen could
not rush until the spring semes-
for.

The advocates of this proposal
believe that it would be a better
system, and would save the fra-
ternities money by eliminating
the fall rush. They also believe
that it would help transfers to
become better acquainted with
all fraternities before they are
forced to make their final de-

. ciston, and would place all the

fraternities on a more equal
basis during rush periods.

if the rush were to continue
for the greater part of two se-
mesters, it only stands to rea-
son lhat the fraternities would
become more competitive.
Rush parties and Open houses
would become something like an
arms race, with each fraternity
trying to impress prospective
members. The larger fraterni-

. ties would be am to overshadow

the smaller fr '.rtplilrwhrmzll

Al the first meeting of the larger, and the smaller fraterni-
lnierfraternity Council (lFC), ties would become smaller.

Those in favor of the pro-
posal also believe that the trans-
fer student should have a longer
time to make a decision. What
of the second semester freshman,
however? lie is stilllimitedtotlle
same four-week period to make
his choice. If rushing has been
conducted according to the [FC
Constitution, the freshmen
should know little or nothing
about the fraternities. Rather
than wait a full year to decide on
which fraternity would be best
for him, the rushes would prob-
ably choose the fraternity which
he was most sure of receiving
a bid from. This is the point
which i feel that i am almost
qualified to make. Rather than
rush, i felt it would be more
worthwhile to wait a semester
to decide between fraternities.
Had i thought lhat i would have
had to wait a full year, however,
i probably would have rushed
merely to avoid the long wait.

it does not seem fair to me
that the transfer student, who is
only here for two years should
be favored over the freshman. Al-
though the present system may
possibly need revision, i believe
that this newly proposed system
seams to fall far short of being
an improvement. it seems to me
that it would. be ouster lo re~

A college planned by students:
that Was the goal of Chancellor
Samuel Gould of the State Uni-
versity of New York when he
authorized five - hundred dollar
grants for twelve undergraduates
in the state University system for
spending three weeks in June at
the new State University College
at Old Westbury, Long island.
After submitting essays on our
ideas for a new college, Bar-
bara Weinstein and l were chos-
en by the staff at Old Westbury
to represent SUNY Albany inthis
undertaking.

Draw on Experience

From the very beginning we
were told that we were here to
givs the Old Westbury staff an
idea of what a modern day col-
lege should be like; that we were
only to draw on our own unfor-
tunate experiences at our home
schools. Being from Albany, Bar-
bara and i had a lot to go on.

i was on the informal group
that was involved with forming
a viable student government for
this college that is not to open
until September 1968. From the
beginning l held to the idea that
Old Westbury should not have any
form of student government at
all unless it can be very differ-
ent and more in keeping withthis
generation than the type of gov-
ernments we are used to. The
idea of the kind ofnon-governmsnt
we have here (as the Old West-
bury staﬂ had been reading the
ASP they knew my tales of 10
per cent voter turnouts and cor-
ruption in high places were sub-
stantially true) thrilled everyone.
We came to very fewconclusions
on the all-important question of
student government but in oth-
er areas things were differ-
ent . . .

Westbury President Prominent

The President of the college
at Old Westbury, Harris Woff-
ord, was President Kennedy's
civil rights assistant and later
in 1961-4 was director of the
Peace Corps along with Sargent
Shriver and Bill Moyers. i
couldn't overestimate the liber-
alism and openmindedness of
Harris.

He listened seriously and with
consideration to even our most
unrealistic suggestions. Most of
our discussion eventually turned
to the “problems” of sex, drugs
and Viet Nam. We were all against

University Rep. to Wmtbury

the war which prompted the re-
porter from NEWSDAY to com-
ment that we wouith't have much
dialogue at Old Westbury if all
the students were as "left" as
we supposedly were. As regards
drugs, we were pretty muchunit-
ed in favor of Old Westbury adopt-
ing some sort of liberal policy
towards the problem.

Each of the twelve of us had
our own area to investigate and
to recommend proposals on.
For the three weeks we went
through a crash program high-
lighted by open seminars run by
various educators and other
knowledgeable persons of a par-
ticular field.

We wanted to learn about drugs
and LSD so Harris had Alan
Watts come down. To talk about
politics and the role of the stu-
dent, we had Bill Moyers, pub
lisher of NEWSDAY and Pres-
ident Johnson's former press
secretary sit on the floor with
us and we unsuccessfully tried
to convince him to tell us what
Lyndon is really like.

No Requirements

We had to end the type of col-
lege education where one requir-
ed step follows another until
graduation. We were quite cer-
tain that we don't want any re-
requirements at Old Westbury;
but did we want any form of
structured courses?

One thing we did decide was
that the Old Westbury student
would be advised to spend a
semester or a year working for
credit in VlSTA, or with the
poor in New York's ghetto or
on a kibbutz in lsrael. in this
way the student would be able
to relate his college learning
to the real world.

“There probably will not be any
semblance of the traditional grad-
ing system at Old Westbury. The
grade a student receives will
probably be decided by the stu-
dent himself in a talk with the
professor. There may he no
grades at all. There will be stu-
dent-faculty committees for the
hiring of new professors, to con-
trol the FSA and regulate the
curriculum.

Initiates Social Action

The role that we sm- Inr ma
Westbury is as an initiator of
social action. it is expected that
Old Westbury will be recognised
as the most progressive college

Jay Rosenberg

in the United States.

On the last day of the "work-
shop" Clnncellor Gould new
down from Albany to see what
we had accomplished. We sat
him down in a conference room
and played a tape for him that
we had been preparing since the
night before. The tape consisted
of Dylan, the Beatles and lots of
us talking about the way we saw
things. It ended with Dylan sing-
ing: “Something is happening
here but you don't know what it
is, do you Mr. Jones."

Gould did not seem too im-
pressed or as one girl put it:
“i felt he sat there wonder-
ing -- is this how i spent $6,-
500."

The "Westbury Experiment"
has just begun. The school will
open with 150 students next Sep-
tember; eventually it will have
an enrollment of five thousand.
The summer workshop will con-
vene in December. it will be in-
teresting to see what we shall
all say after another semester
at our home schools.

our New Campus

What shall i say? I 
them some more about
campus and the quality of some
of our faculty. Even Gould in
talking about his State Univer-
sity refers to Binghamton's es-
tablished excellence, Stony Brook
as a new MIT, UB as the east’s
Berkeley, and Albany's superb
campus.

We hear loisoftalkthatSUNYA
is a top rated university and I
am sure it is. The problem here
is not the administration and it
is not the faculty. Our trouble
is that the administration of Al-
bany State is more liberal than
the student body.

And the student leaders seem
anxious only to be elected and
then completely cop out. Out-Stu-
dent Association, Myskanis and
Central Council are run by the
kind of individual who would fit
in rather well as well-paid lack-
eys in the Albany Democratic
Machine. The bookstore is run
like a company store; we have no
alternative but to shop there.

Things must change here. After
my experience at Old Westbury
l am convinced that the student
can make a difference. That is
the relevance of Old Westbury's
texperiment — we must begin to
ry.

Over the next few weeks, Bos-

become one of the most admired
-—and maligned — figures in the
American legal profession.

And Oteri -- a legal rational-
ist of the old school, who even
looks a bit like Darrow - is
simply "doing his thing." in his
own words: “Five years ago, i
began defending kids accused of
various marijuana violations.
I've been singularly impressed
with these people - decent kids,
not criminals, not violent, full
of life and peace.

"Each one told me the same
story —- marijuana is not addic-
tive, not harmful, a relatively
innocuous substance. i started
checking into it and decided that
the next time we got a case
we would challenge the law.

The defendants' motion con-
tends that the Massachusetts sta-
into is "arbitrary and irration-
al and not suited to achieve any

fails to properly distinguish be-
tween marijuana and socalled
'hard narcotics,’ such as co-
caine, opium and morphine, and
it imposes harsh penalties upon

juana is kept, without showing
that use of this substance pre-
seats a threat to the public

the future leaders of this coun-
try, branding them as "drug ad-
diets."

"We are not advocating ie-
galization of marijuana," he
stressed, "but we say that it
could be regulated, with pro-
hibitions on age groups that can
get it, and so forth," he says.

"The claims of grave danger
are contradicted by the weight
of scientific evidence, which evi-
dence is being ignored by the
government, and hence the sta-
tute under which defendant is
prosecuted, and the entire stalli-
tory scheme, violates the due
process of law guaranty of the

The motion further argueathat

the statute “goes beyondthe valid
exercise of police power of the
Commonwealth in that it seeks
to control activity which has not
