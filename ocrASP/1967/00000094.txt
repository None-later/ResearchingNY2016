Second Time A round

by Igor lloroluk

When this colurnnwas originat-
ed, it dealt basicaﬂy with folk
music. Just as the term “folk”
has been broadened and applied
to many varied phases ofpopuiar
music, so has this column evolv-
ed to review a wider range of
music. In the coming year, I
will try to deal with what is

penlng on the concert music
scene with the intention of apply-
ing it to folk-oriented fields.

Questions on Planning

Last weekend's BuffaloSpring-
field, Janice Ian concert brought
up many questionsonthe planning
of our University Concerts. I
think most people who saw the
Buffalo Springfield Friday night
left the Ballroom disappointed,
through no fault of the group.
Much of this disappointment was
due to the two hours' delay of
the performance.

The group was forced to play
without being able to adjust their
equipment to the acoustic condi-
tions of the ballroom. These
cmditions are quite different
from what the group is used to.
Another pet gripe of mine is that
the audience shouldn't be forced
to sit In jackets and ties through
a rock concert.

Spontanelty Out

This cuts out any spontaneity
and stifles the audience's re-
sponse, an integral part of any
pop event. The graip seemed
stiited, like a good recording,
but not as though they were per-
forming a live concert. How-
ever, the same thing could be
said for the audience.

Even so, the group managed a
couple of highlights in their
second show, the flrstbelng their
biggest hit, FOR WHAT IT'S
WORTH, which I believe they'll
never equal with any future re-
cording. The song has every-
thing, tremendous lyrics, and a
good, catchy, but not overly com-
mercial sound.

it was a sure thing when it
came out last year. Buffalo
Springfield finished with their
second single, BLUEBIRD. This
song made it regionally,but not
in this area. in this am, an
extended version showing off
their instrumental abilities in,
as they put it. “West Coast
freakout music."

High for Evening

They hit a high for the even-
ing, which again pointed to the
lack of reopens. Whattheyneed-
ed in czder to impress our
audience was an Avaim. «1 Hi.
more indroormnoohsix i'maky
looking  “u!”

t .

merslon we would have dug them.

Janis lan, on the other hand,
was unbelieveabiy impressive.
She was announced, and out she
came, a long-haired, sixteen-
year-old, who, as soon as she
opened her mouth captivated the
audience with her poise,
assurance, and bitterness.

She's intelligent beyond her
years, and some of her jokesand
songs went over the heads of our
so-caiied sophisticated audience.
At this, she laughed even louder
than we did. Physically, Janis
Ian is still a girl, but musically
and lyrically, she is a full grown
woman.

Recurring Theme

it's frightening because her
recurring theme is youth grow-
ing up too fast, not by their own
will, but by that of their grown-
ups. Her songs cover prostitu-
tion, adultery, marijuana, ciga-
retts, parents, and the Great
Society; all harshly, ironically,
and sarcastically. Her musical
ability is tremendous. She sings
well, but plays guitar and piano
even better. Janis lan, “Sooiety's
Child," is one of the ﬁnest young
talents around. Sometimes i
wonder, though, who's been push-
ing her, andl feel sad.

Primer
Celebrates25lh
Anniversary

This year "Primer," Albany's
oldest student literary magazine,
celebrates its 25th year on
campus. “Primer” serves as an
outlet for creative th0ught and
offers Its contributors a chance
for constructive criticism and
literary recognition.

The success and continuation
of the "Primer" tradition de-
pends on student Interest and
student contributions.

Since Hm, "Primer" has in-
cluded mainly short fiction, poe~
try, and drama. This year we
hope to receive more essay and
non-fiction works; more quality
work in all fields will be needed
to make this 25th anniversary
issue an outstanding publication.

All Interested students are web
ed t-r submit their writ s stthe
 Hominy be

junk of which the usual comment
is "I throwithat stuff away."
But Clark has taken nuts and
bolts, scraps of wood and metal,
chimney flues, bottle caps, re-
versible steel spindles, hinges,
broken chair legs, old license
plates, toy guns and cars, pliers,
etc., etc., and by some magic of
creative genius, has combined
them all into artistically gratify-
ing pieces.

These reliefs are the kinds of
things you can sit and look at for
hours, constantly making new
discoveries within the four bound-
aries (usually) of the frame. He
likes to work "the larger the
better" but finds difficulty in
getting his larger works through
doors; thus he has had to limit
himself to an extent.

Mr. Clark’s main fascination
is in the female form. "College
girls keep you young," he says.
"They keep you from getting too
serious about life." He draws
healthy, buxom females, adorning
them with bikini-type cover-ups
(1 various materials from
Yiddish and Japanese news-
papers to pink tissue paper, which
he pastes down, dampens, and
partially rips up, to achieve a
uniquely textured effect, and " Im-
prove the quality of the images
in relief."

‘Torso and Objects'

One relief, which he has arbit-
rarily titled "Torso and
Objects," will be exhibited later
this month in the faculty show

7 which will run concurrently with

the Neisal A. Rockefeller Coil’ec-
tion in the Art Gallery of the
Fine Arts Building.

This relief is about 3% x 41/2
feet, one of the larger ones in the
show, and displays a plaster cast

of a female figure from chest to .

hip, coated thickly with gray
paint, and heavily covered with
polyester to give It a hard finish.
Some distance above the body is
a plaster face mask, the upper
portion of which is covered with
a pair of goggles.

Surrounding the torso are the
objects — a lady's high-heeled
shoe at hip level, a license plate
on the bottom, pot covers, a
variety of bottles andbcttle caps,
all bearing some word or design
in relief, such as "liqueur,"
“cointreau,” and “insert screw-

Weedy Material

Some kind of woody, hairy
material floats about the head.
Yet all of these objects are
neatly ordered, dawn tothe heart-
adorned belt-buckle on the navel.
The gray paint gives a metallic,
blended look to the work, unify-
ing the conglomerate objects into

Auditions Planned
For TwoMore Plays

Following hard on the heels of
the selection of the cast forHThe
Private Life ofthe Master Race,"
the State University Theater's
first production of the year, audi-
tions for two more productions
have been scheduled for the next
two weeks. The first of the two
auditions will be for the Thesis
Laboratory Production of the
original one-act play, "A Piece
of Cake” (subtitled: "The Sound
of Deagle Domen inYour Ears").

The second auditions will be
for the state University Theatre
production of Elmer Rice's ex-
pressionistlc drama, "The Add-
ing Machine," which will be di-
rected by Martin Mann who has
directed past University Theatre
productions of “Stop the World,l
Want to Get Off” and"AClearing
in the Woods."

'A Piece of Cake'

"A Piece of Cake" will be di-
rected by William A. Frankonis
who is also the author ofthe play.
Frankonis is directing the play as
part of his thesis requirements
in the graduate program of the
Department ofSpeech and Drama-
tic Art.

The play, which the director-
author describes broadly as an
experiment in audience involve-
ment, requires only one male
and one female for its casc.“Both
roles are good, strenuous ones,"
the director says, “so casting the
parts will bedlfficuit unless there
is a good turnout at auditions."

The tryouts for Frankonis' play
will be held Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday, October 9, 10, and
ii, at 7:80 p.m. In Richardson
29]. Examination scripts of the
play are available from Frank-
onis In ilumsnities 368. The try-
outs are open to all students.

Him”

17, and 18, at 7:30 p.m. in Rio-
hardson 291, Martin Mann will
hold auditions for the University
Theatre production of "The Add-
ing Machine."

“By not limiting our auditions
to drama students," Mann com-
mented, "we have found some
excellent actors and actresses —
freshmen through graduate stu-
dents — who are not drama
students.” To this he added the
special reminder that the audi-
tions were definitely open to all.

Of "The Adding Machine"
it has been said that Elmer Rice
exposed “the starved and bitter
llttieness and the huge universal-
ity of the Zero type, the slave
type, that from eternity to
eternity expresses the futility
and the tragedy of the mediocre
spirit." The slaves are "white-
collar slaves," willing victims
of a world of repression and
inhibition.

Copies of the script have been
placed on reserve in the Uni-
versity library for thosewhowish
to read it before the auditions.
Mann also announced that those
who wish to audition but cannot
do so at the specified times
should see him personally in his
office, Humanities 316, to make
other arrangements.

a meaningfui (if obscurer 50)
whole.

In "Orange and Gray Torso,"
his design is somewhat less
obvious, for one is hard not to
find a semblance of abody among
the Elmer's GIue-All’d objects.
But the texture and color of this
relief are most appealing.

Basically black, the surface '

has been unevenly sprayed In
spots with rust-colored paint,
which gives a realistically rust.-
ed appearance to the metal and
wood. The surface had agrainy
texture, as if it were covered
with sawdust or sand, and Clark
has occasionally highlighted the
little bumps withwhlte to augment
the tactile quality. There is a
round object at the top of the
relief, possibly the head, that
looks like the Iron framework
of a miniature rose window.
'Touch Mei'

Only one college In the entire
exhibit is covered with glass.
The rest of the relief collages
seem to jump out at you with
their variegated surface textures
and say "Touch me!" One place
looks like a door and you want
to go through it.

His colors are for the most
part earthy tones'which embrace
rather than put off the observer.
Clark works with a driving force
of creative impulse. He says,
“I do it because I can't not do
it," and this feeling of almost
explosive creativity is communi-
cated to the viewer in a way
which would be impossible on
twodimensionai canvas.

The Clark exhibit will be vi-
brating in the Campus Center Art
Gallery for just a short time
longer. Experience ltl

Drama Council
To Discuss Plays

On Monday evenhlg, Oct. 9,
the Dramatics Council will hold
the first of a series of sessions
designed to promote divergent
dramatic activity throughout the
university. During this first ses-
sion we plan to discuss the selec-
tion and presentation of an
original play.

We welcome anyone who would
like to submit his script or is
interested in the practical
aspects of such a project. The
session will be held in the Campus
Center at 8 p.m. The room will be
posted on the "Campus Center
Directory."

FINDLAY COCKRELL turned in an excellent performance
both in technique and expression in his plane concert last

Friday night.

I. The Spectator

 

by Robert B. Cutty

l
. if The Broadway season opened
again as usual with a failure.
Simultaneously, the off-Broadway
season also opened again na-
turally with a critical and, with
lack, popular success.

1 can't answer the question of
why every new season tends to
begin in this manner, for even
the New York critics have been
foiled in the search for an an-
swer. In general, these devout
students of the modern theatre
have summed up their collective
result with a sardonic shrug and
a disillusioned smile.

-‘ . Intriguing—
! ; Particularly intriguing wasthe
’ . nature of these two opening pro-
ductions. The Broadway produc-
tion was lra Levin’s "Dr.Cook’s
Garden." Levin is the critical-
ly approved author of the best-
selling novei about a modern
witch, "Rosemary's Baby,"
presently being filmed In New
York.

The off-Broadway enterprise
was a far more ambitious piece
than Levin’s “modern” melo-
drama. Adapted by Hugh Leon-
ard from James Joyce's "The
Portrait of an Artist as a Young
Man" and “Stephen Hero,"
"Stephen D" is an attempt to
capture Joyce’s birth as an in-
tellectual in a series of drama-
tic incidents and monologues.

Wrong With '(iurden'

What was wrong with 'uarden'?
Clive Barnes of The New York
Times, in his first review for
that paper, felt that Levin's so-
called moral theme reduced the
play from high dranm to low
farce.

The theme concerns Dr. Cook's
insane belief that he hasthe right
to kill off all the "evil" people
in his home town. The discovery
by a younger doctor of Cook's
capers leads to all sorts of
dreadfully suspenseful events
which, according to Barnes, were
absurdly comical.

Not having seen the play i
am unable to describe how and
why the melodrama was never
able to rise above the level of
a laugh-provoking fiasco. How-
over, just a description of the
climax, in which the younger
doctor" "cleverly" outwits Dr.
Cook by causing the latter to
accidentally poison himself,
reads, in Barne’s prose, like a
masterpiece of comedy invention.

Sympathy With Struggle

in contrast, Barnes writes with
areal sympathy of Leonard’s
struggle to give theatrical mean-
ing and excitement to Joyce's
throbbing, rhythmic prose.
Though Barnes felt that the play
licked Joyce's sense of the sig-
nificance of certain events in
lite over other actions, he was,
nonetheless, impressed with
be ard's effort.

due to the predictable opening
of this season.

i hope that the rest of the
year will make up forthe unspec-
tacular beginning and that the
1967-1968 season, both on Broad-
way and off. will end In a blaze

‘ ' 2...... .. .2.-  .... -‘ "

 

by John Webb

, Findlay Cockreil, one‘ of the University’s
real musical artists, providedns in his con-

cert on Friday, with.,a perfectly delightful '

‘and exciting evening. His program was en-
titled, “The Romantics,"
by Chopin, Schumann, Liszt, Brahms and end-
ing'. with an encore by “The one romantic
.that was left out," Mendelssohn.

Mr. Cockreil opened his program with "Car-

' naval, Scenes mignonnes sur quatre notes" ‘

by Schumann. Each section of "Carnavai,"
of which there are 21, beginning with'the
"Preambule" and ending with the “Marche
des lDnvidsbundler' contre les Phllistlns,"
is given a name, most of these being Biblical
terms or names of people, etc, 0ne,he chose
to call "Chopin," so in this section he In-
serts a distinctive Chopin theme while in-
termingllng his own style.

Dynamic Ending

in the section "Paganini" the final bars
build up to a very dynamic ending, but the
final chords are very very soft, an effect
which Cockreil gained by laying his fingers
lightly on the keys 'so only the overtones
could be heard. This entire number was of
tremendous difficulty requiring extreme ver-
satility and perfect technique, all of which
were beautifully exhibited. At times, perhaps
two fingers of a hand were sustaining a steady,
pulsating chord, while the other three were
playing the moving notes.

He then turned to the beautiful, soft and mel-
odic “Consolationrln D flat" by Liszt, requir-
ing the height of lntérpretatiom it was ex-
tremely interesting to watch the way be ap-
proached each phrase. One could see his mind
and eyes working very intensely so that When
he brought his hands down, the resulting touch
would produce the proper effect. He always
succeeded — the same being true later in
the Chopin numbers.

The first half of the program was closed
with Liszt's frantic and extremely difficult
“Mephisto Waltz." At times the music reach-
ed such dynamic dimensions that Cockrell’s
entire body — every muscle — came alive
in response. The number was beautifully
executed.

Brahms’ ‘Variaiions'

The second half opened with Brahms’ "Vari-
aliens and Fugue on a Theme by Handel."

featuring. works I -

My one reaction to u... workout! is that Brah ’ '

[certalniy‘had a ball with Handel, and at time

during its performance, i simply had to chuck! .
This number, has unfortunately beentranscribed
for orchestra by Edmund Hubbra. It loses pra‘

: tlca‘iiy"e"verything,' and cannot be compar

to his very beautiful 'Warlations" on my
which‘is performed primarily by orchestra.
‘This, was also ,very difficult but well done.

Polonaise - Fantasy by Chopin (not to you.
coldused with the famous Polonaise so popu-
larly performed by iturbe) was similar in
many respects to the Brahms number, and.
was by far the low point in the evening. Al-
though, again, the performance was brilliant
in every respect right down to the fast thrills
— so fast that his fingers were a blur — the.
heat, and rather boring number began to have
its effect on the audience. It is my opinion'
that a slightly varied number could have been
chosen for this spot.

Chopin's very exciting “Ballade in G Mi-
nor," closed the performance. Conditions for
the concert were absolutely deplorable. The .
humidity was unbelievable, as well as the
heat, obviously making the keys wet and sticky.
Quite frequently Mr. Cockreil was forced to
stop and wipe the keys, and during the sec-.
end portion of the concert had to dispense
with his glasses. .

Student Attendance Poor

My over-ail reaction to this concert, as is
rarely my case, is one of complete praise.
Cockreli's technique and expression are
both excellent. One becomes enraptured by
the effect which he produces as well as by
watching him manipulate. I saw only one dis-
appointing feature, and this was the attendance
on the part of the student body — it was
damn poor. We are supposed to be a univer-
sity which is growing culturally, primarily
in music and theater. The concert on Friday
certainly did not show it when the majority
of the fairly sizeable audience was from the
outside. If students can come all the way
from Union for this, why can’t State show
up. It’s about time a lot of students here
woke up.

i fully expect to see Findlay Cockreil's
name on the marquis of Carnegie Hall in
the future, and my one and only comment
in response to his performance on Friday
is — "Mr. Cockreil, it certainly is an honor
to have you on our faculty."

 

 

The Jazz Review

 

With the present state of flux_by Paul iiorn’s ensemble,

that jazz is going through in this
country, we are In grave danger
of losing sight of some very im-
portant filings that are happen-
ing now. All that l have been
hearing and reading these past
few months has been about the
new movement and the new ris.
ing stars.

Needless. to say, this is a
wonderful thing. i only wish that
more new artists could get the
publicity, coverage, and reviews
that Charles Lloyd, Sun Its, Ar-
chie Sllepp, Gerald Wilson and
the myriad of others who are
now in the Jazz limelight have
been awarded.

‘OId-timcru

But! Let us not forget the work
that is still being done by the
"old-timers." You see, jazz
is one of the few srtforms where
the old bruins still come up
with some very new and excit-
iug ideas. Composers like the
Duke, Lalo Schifriu (who was
playing, arranging and compos-
ing for Dizzy in the 405), Ella
Miles, and the everlasting Diz-
zy are still working, writing
and ever-creating ideas and
compositions that nrejustas cur-
rent and exciting us anything
done by the "young bloods."
Let me cite some examples.

Duke Ellington has composed
and is now performing a rail-
gious work that, according to
the national critics, staggers the
mind. it is amazing that any
one human being can continue

to spew forth beauty the way
that Duke and his band have been
doing since before we were born.

Lalo Schifl‘iu's “Jazz Suite
on the Moss Texts" is quite
frankly, beyond description. but
then, his work always has boon,

ing the Springfield performance,

 

 

 

orchestra and chorus. in this
work, asin“Gillespiana,"Schlf-
rin makes use of the “concerto
grosso" technique where a group
of soloists are backed up by a
larger orchestral ensemble. in
the suite however, he goes fur-
ther than ever before with such
orchestral combinations as bells,
bass, snare drum and alto flute.

in this one particular Inter-
lude, Horn is simultaneously vo-
calizlng the same pitches he is
playing on the alto flute, thus
creating a very haunting effect
that is heightened by the. chorus
singing "Lamb of God . . ."
in a pianissimo. To make the
total sound even more mystic
and diaphunous, this entire se-
quence was recorded with an
echo chamber.

As for Ella, Miles and Dizzy,
i don't think anything need be
said. Ella's voice seems to im-
prove every time she sings. Silo
has the only voice in the world
that is really a complete orches-
tra. Miles has been delving into
the New Tiling with some very
surprising and delightful results.

Most Unusual Lines

"ESP" has some new compo-
sitions and "Four d: More" pre-
sents some of the most unusual
lines ever to be heard by any
trumpeter including those used
by Bill Dixon. As for Dizzy,
well, Dizzy is Dizzy.

The main point that needs em-
phasizing is that there must be
a concerted effort on the part of
the public to maintain equilib-
rium. The new things and new
artists are just that: new things
and new artists. They have vi-
tality, beauty and a spirit of
"more to come." But those so-
called "old-timers" havo been
giving us the more that came
for many years new. '

The surprising thing is that
THE"? current "more" is as

satifui, and vital and alive as

arrangers. The suite is‘cpluyedu.’ tlyb youngsters they trained and

present work just a bit better
than that of the youngsters. it is
better because if is laced with
that certain finesse and sophis-
tication that only comes with
years of experience.

But, don't worry, aspirants.
Those years of experience are
something we all gain sooner or
later. I can wait. ‘

What you are about to read
is simply an addition to the or-
iginal column i had written for
this week. I feel this addition to
be necessary after witnessing
the spectacle that took place at
the Campus Center this past
Friday.

Janis Ian and the Buffalo
Springfield appeared In Concert
in the Ballroom that night, thus
adding to the amazing list ofstar
performers who have graced our
stages in the past years. To say
the least, both were in rare form
and gave me an experience i
will never forget.

Unfortunately, the audience at
the first performance seemed
filled with people who have never

 

part of the audience evidently
thought very little of the group
and started to walk out. i can't
begin to say how much this be-
havior rankled me, the rest of
the audience, and the perform-
ers. When are you people going
to learn?

Needless to say, it is your
right to express your distaste
at a performance. But, don’t
you think that manners enter in
under these circumstances?
Couldn't you have been a little
quieter when leaving? Better
still, couldn't you have stuck
it out? Don't you think they de-
served that little courtesy?

I realize thnt the first per-
formance of the Springfield was
extremely rough in spots. But
realize the conditions they were
working under (the ballroom isn't
exactly famous for its acous-
tics). Give them the righttoblun-
der (if they blundered) and make

corrections.
For once In your lives, start

using some of the "cool" you
claim you have.
