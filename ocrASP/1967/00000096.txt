lntetmural- football .is about to .take a share of the

interest in 'Albany. State's autumn sports. Soccer-and

‘ creswountw are the two big fall sports in which there
is' intercollegiate competition. Football, however, as play-
ed st'SUNYA contains enough skill and action‘to provide
the modest sports fans with 'an ample amount of enjoy-
ment. The avid sports fan, however, ifforced to settle for
intermurai football, should be treated to the best played
and best officiated game possible. Yet, the AMIA, with
its annual changes, still continuesto make little progress,
and often puts itself in a weaker position than in the
previous years.

For instance, last year for the first time, goal posts
were installed in the end zones of the League 1 field.
Excellent move, yet even though injuries in the league
were at an all-time high last year, and more safety pre-
cautions were taken this year, it was not until last week
that a student suggested that perhaps a good move would
be to pad the goal posts. The head of' the league, a faculty
member, first had the reaction, "in the old days they
didn't pad them.” One basic difference between the old
college days and the present AMIA days is equipment -—
shoulder pads, helmets, and other protective equipment.
However, it was finally promised that the idea of padded
goal posts would be looked into.

A rule has been added which will enable the AMIA to
lose out on quality ball players. The Phys Ed staff has
agreed that it would be best'to bar any former letterman
at SUNYA from playing in the AMIA in that particular
sport. In this way, it is hoped more players will be
encouraged to go out for varsity sports. This would
counteract any pressure a fraternity might put on one of
its brothers to play intermurals rather than varsity. The
reaction to this rule is that it’sfor the birds.

One last point. Did you ever play in a baseball game
where the umpire called time out so he could find the
contact lens that just dropped out of his eye during the
last pitch? Did you ever play in a football game in which
the official didn't know which side of the whistle to blow
to make sound come out? Or did you ever run in a track
meet in which the starting judge was too afraid to pull the
trigger of the starting gun? This is AMIA officiating at its
best. With the funds AMIA has at its disposal, a qualified
official should be supplied for each Leaguel football game.
He should be aided by officials hired by the league and be
paid more than a dollar a game.

The Albany State barriers gained their first victory of the season with an impressive
15-50 win over Plattsburgh. Plattsburgh was completely out-classed in the meet as the
Great Danes captured the first ten positions of the meet. This victory for the harriers
was the, first time that they have ever recorded a shutout against their opponents. Coach
Munsey was extremely happy with the race, yet he expressed some disappointment that

, his runners could not have bettered their winning times.

Paul» Roy, who finished first in the meet against the Coast Guard Academy, again
finished first with a winning time of 27:57. Mike Attweil, who followed Roy across the
wire against the Coast Guard, duplicated the feat with a time of 27:58. The strong finish-
es of these two point to a strong one-two punch for Albany in future meets. Paul Breslin,
who finished third with a time of 28é5l, was voted the Runner of the Meet award as he
turned in his best run since his freshman year.

Following the first three across the finish line was Don Beevers with a time of 29:02.

Beevers was followed
closely by George Rolling
who completed the course
in 29:07 thus giving the
first five finishers a
spread of only ‘10 seconds.

Joe Keating. still not
fully recovered from a leg
injury came in sixth,
followed by Bob Mulvey
and Jim Keating who
crossed the line holding
hands.

Coach Munsey express-
ed extreme happiness at
how well his runners
bounced back from their

disappointing loss to the
Coast Guard and commented that
they would have done even better
if they had raced Plattsburgh in
the later part of the season.
Munsey explained that some of
his runners were still not in top
condition and stated that his team
would be even tougherwhen these
runners returned to their pre-
vious form.

Of the top ten finishers for
Albany, only two, Joe Keating
and Bob Mulvey (the co-captains)
are seniors, thus indicating that
the team will be strong not only
this year, but in years to come.

Freshmen impressive

To further this idea is the fact
that in the iludson Valley in-
vitational, the freshmen finished
three medalists and four runners
in the top twenty-five.

Great Dane Booters Drop 2.
Will Meet Adelphi Tomorrow

by Walt Doherty

BRIDGE PORT - All-American Alex Popovitch scored in each of the first three
periods Saturday, as he led a powerful Bridgeport squad to a 6-0 win over the
Albany State soccer team. The Albany hooters, up against a real soccer power
that went to the quarter finals of the NCAA soccer tournament last year, looked
better than the score would indicate to the casual observer. The team played

reasonably well, but Bridgeport just had too much talent.

Coach Garcia com-
mented that he felt that
the Bridgeport team was
much improved over last
year, and he felt that the
Great Danes probably
played better than they
did on Wednesday when
they fell to Oneonta by
a 3-1 count.

Albany switched from a
four man to a three man
line for the encounter, a
strategy that was hamper-

been making considerable im-
provement ever since. Kahn who
was switched to halfback for the
game played a solid hustling

game throughout.

in last Wednesday‘s game the
Red Dragons from Oneontajump-
ed into a 2-0 lead with two goals
late in the first period. Albany
got one back in the second when
Phil Kahn fed the ball to Gary
Swart0ut for a loft fwted shot
that sailed over the outstretched
arms of the goalie. Oneonta came
back for a goal at l8:00 of the
third quarter, and that sealed
the game.

tral council Meeting last Thurs. Mishkin became President of
Student Association and Downes was elected vice-president.

VOL. LIV. N0. 3

Mishkin, S.A. President

Downes, Vice President

Jeffrey Mishkin became Presi-
dent of student Association upon
acceptance of the resignation of
William T. Cleveland by Cen-
tral Council Thursday. To fill
the office of vice president left
vacant by Mishkin, the council
elected Paul Downes.

Central Council, by an unof-
ficial count, accepted Cleveland’s
resignation with a 19-0-2 vote.
Although Cleveland_gave up the
Chairman’s seat, he will still on
council as a representative from
Community Programming Com-
mission. This ls the first presi-
dential resignation to be tender-
ed to an accepted by Central
Council.

Mishkin, being 19, is one of
the youngest presidents to head
Student Association. He receiv-
ed his seat on council by being
)opularly elected from Colonial
Quad. Last yearMishkinaiso ran
for the presidency of the class
of ’69. He was elected tosucceed
John l-lowland, who did 'not run.

Part Of Independent Study

An “Experimental Seminar,"
presently underway at the Uni-
versity, will set up a model
Free University as "an experi-
ment in education for educa-
tion's sake."

The ‘Ssminar,’ which is be-
ing directed by University stu-
dent Louis Strong as part of
a sociological independent study
in cooperation with the Univer-
sity’s Sociology Department, will
consist of a series of lectures
and discussions to be held from
Oct. 24 - Dec. 1.

Strong explained that in set-
ting up the ‘Semlnar,’ which will
be open to all interested stu-
dents and faculty, he and his
staff in "actuality have a dual
purpose in this project. My staff
and i are fully intent on promot-
ing the Free University concept

on this campus.
Step forward

“i feel this is one of the
greatest steps that American
Education has taken in the past
century."

The 'frse unlvsrsity' concept,
or that of education on an entire-
ly free non-credit, non-restrict-
ed basis, may be found in work-
ing model at the University of
Chicago, and is similar to the
free curriculum idea at Bear
nington College.

Although educationally it is a
step forward, Strong explained
that it is also “a reversion to
the past, for the schools of today
developed from the open air lec-
tures of the Greeks, which had no
degree program."

Seminar lectures will be con-
ducted in the manner of these

ject of "Professionalism in Pol-
itics" at the Holiday innat 8 p.m.

Miss Reagan graduated from
Marymount College in Arlington,
Va., and has been active in poll-
tics since 1060 whensho served
as a volunteer worker in the
Nixon-Lodge campaign.

As Director of Field Services
for Constitutional Alliance lnc.,

WSUA To Hold
Contest Tonight

Tonight WSUA Radio will hold
the Baseball Examination for
their current contest. it is to be
a one-hour short-answer exam
to last all areasofbasebailknow-
ledge.

The exam will be given at 7:30
p.m. in 137. The person who re-
ceives the highest grade in the
exam will win 20 brand new
record albums.

The person who obtains the
second highest score will win

booklet for their sports library.

open air lectures. Strong is work-
ing to assure that classes he
held in areas which will be op-
timal for free discussion.

The lectures will be by people
who have functional and working
knowledge in the field they will
be discussing; some of them are
non-degree people, but Strong
says "they do have the practical
experience, an element sorely
lacking in some of the people
now teaching in American edu-
cational institutions.”

Second purpose

The second purpose of the in-
dependent study will be the collec-
tion of data by Strong and his
staff.

For this reason those who
participate in the Seminar will
be asked to fill out question-
naires which will be kept strict-
ly confidential.

However, Strong emphasized
that he didn't want the people
who take part in the Seminar
to think "they are being used
as guinea pigs."

"The experimental Seminar is
a very real thing with a very
real purpose. The study, while
not a secondary issue, is of no
more importance than the Sam-
inar itself; Both are equally im-
portani."

The six week Seminar will be
divided into three twweek ser-
ies which will delve intolhe three
following areas: The total Inter-
action of Modern Art; Academic
Power in National and interna-
tional Politics; and The Puritan
Ethic Versus Brotherly Love:

The first topic of the series
will investigate how the music,
painting, dance, films, and the
theater etc. of today can be,
and are utilized to bring about
the total interaction of the arts.

The second series willdlscuss
the nature (1 pressure groups
on Campus; both their present
and potential power.

The third series will view
afﬂuent modern America where
the “total love of self and ma-
terial things is in constant com-
petition with love of fellow, and
self respect."

Any interested parties can get
in touch with strong, by letter
in care of the ASP.

(Jo-chairman

One of the greatest accomp-
lishments of Mlshkinwss his co-
chairmanship of the 22 hour tele-
thon last year..'viishkin and Co-
Chairman John Foils co-ordinat-
ed this varieiy show which rais-
ed over $5,000 for mental health.

One of Mishkin’s objectives as
Student Association President is
to revise and update the chaper-
one policy. To achieve this and,
Mishkin appointed Nancy LePoro,
member of council, chairman of
an ad hoc committee concern-
ing chapsrone policy. At the pres-
ent time two chaperones, a man
and a woman, are required for
every 50 students.

When asked if the STD
"Ring" myth would plague him
as it did his predecessor, Mis-
kln expressed his belief that it
become an issue under his ad-
ministration. Mishkin, an STD
brother, supported this statement
by pointing to the fact that the
STD members on Central Coun-
cil don't act as a block.

Downes elected

Downes was elected as Vice
President of Central Council by
a unanimous vote. He received
his seat as a representativefrom
Religious Affairs Commission.
The second representative from
that commission is Waller Do-
herty. Downes is also Presi-
dent of Alphi Phi Gamma, the
journalism honorary.

tral Council when he was afresh-
man. Because (1 a bout with

resent Reiigious Affairs at Cen-
tral Council. He has held that
seat ever since. Previous to his

Association, Downes will assume
the duties of Chairman of the
Student Tax Committee. A son-
ior, Downes has served as busi-
ness manager of "Campus View-
point" and “Primer.”

Image suffered
Mishkin and Downes admit that
the image d Central Council

has suffered during the past so-
mester and must be improved.
if is Mishkin's hope that the mam-
bers of the council will be able
to become more involved in pol-
icy debato rather than be bogged
down in procedural discussion.

Downes stated that he is look-
ing forward to working with Jeff
and that he is sure they can both
work together to restore ihefaith
in Student Association. As Stu-
dent Tax Committee Chairman,
Downes is planning to revise the '
Tax policy.

Cleveland effective

While speaking of Clevelgpd,
Mishkin stated, "Bill, for the
year he was president, was eit-
tre mely effective in getting things
done; i hope i could be as ef-
fectlvs."

dent Association, wouldnormally
serve on the Board of Directors
of F.S.A. Since he is not 21,
