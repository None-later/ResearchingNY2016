The Joint Committee on Non-
Western studies has sponsored
year-long joint faculty seminars
each of the past three years.

The 1964-65 seminar on Far
Eastern Art and Culture was
conducted at Skidmore College;
the 1965-66 meetings on Latin
America, at Union College; and
the 1986-67 sessions on Islamic
Studies, at SUNYA.

The 1967-68 seminar on Af-
rica will be held at Siena Col-
lege.
Additionally, the committee
has sponsored the appearance of
scholars in non-Western stud-
ies on individual campuses as
lecturers-in-residence for brief
periods.

A study in the areas of sex
education, drugs and related
health matters, entitled "Work-
shop on Sex Education and
Drugs," is being made under 
initiation of the student Affairs
staff. other departments within
the campus in the areasofllealth
service, Counseling. Service,
Residences, Student Activities
and Physical Education are also
participating in the workshop.

The "Workshop on Sex Educa-

- tion and Drugs" deals with all

health problems that students
may encounter. Dean Lois Gregg,
Associate Dean of Students, felt
the faculty would benefit from
such a program in realizing the
problems and offering solutions
to them.

The workshop, started during
the past summer, initially con-
sisted d forty~five faculty mem-
bers. At the present more facul-
ty members are participating. it
is their purpose to get together
and exchange ideas on the prob-
lems of sex education, drugs and
related health problems.

Dean Gregg felt this was a
big step in forming acommuni-

Bio. Club Takes
Trip to RI.

“Hey, there goes a lesser
yellow legsl" "This crab is preg-
nantl” Enthusiasm pervaded the
atmosphere the other day as fac-
ulty and students of the Biology
Department traveled to Rhoda
island on their annual field trip.

Designed towards a study of
marine organisms in their na-
tural environments, the trip was
of special interest to students
of ecology, invertebrate biology,
and plant morphology.

A great deal of the success of
the excursion was due to the
presence of several members
of the Biology faculty: Dr. M.
Stewart, Drs. Lemon and S.
Brown and Dr. R. D. Allen,
G. Lish, H. Winn and 8. Mac-
hanon.

cation link between faculty'and
students in an important area
of student problems. The groups
are not structured, as the goal
of the workshop is to have a
free and. informal session in
order to discuss and possibly
find solutions to these prob-
lems.

Dr. Janet Hood, Director of
Student Health Services, felt the
objective of the workshop was to
"review together better ways to

- communicate with students on any

subject and try to help students
when they come' to them." In
addition she felt that it can also
present medical facts with a
medical background of drugs:
a respect for drugs in general
and an understanding of their
effects while remaining as

' scientific as possible.

Both Dean Greg and Dr. llood
felt that each student problem
is individual although the prob-
lem may be part of a broader
and more general problem such
as the use of marijuana.

The problem of narcotic usage
is treated like any other health
problem, according to Dr. Hood.
"it is’ a medical, not a legal
problem.” '

Dean Gregg also said that the
workshop will be openfor student
leaders shortly.

' Transmitting To

Colonial Quad

As of last Saturday, residents
of the Colonial Quad shouldbe
able to receive transmittingfrom
WSUA, the University radio sta-
tion. The fact that WSUA could

‘not reach the Colonial Quad at.

the beginning of this year was

due to the fact that the tunnel sys- v
toms to that Quad were incom- /

pleted at that time.

in order for WSUA to be able ‘

to reachthe quadsonthe new cam-
pus it is necessary for cables
,to be run through the tunnels;
however, until the tunnels were
completed and formally sign-
ed over to the University, they
were the property of the con-
structors and not open for cables.

The cable WSUA was able to,

install in the tunnels Saturday
is a temporary broadcast trans-
mitter system d 30 watts. This
cable \is to be replaced by a sys-
tem comparable in power to that

. used for the Dutch Quad (250

watts) as soon as possible.
WSUA «engineers expressed a
wish that “the people of Colon-
ial Quad bear with us — we are
working as fast -as we can to
bring a good signal to you."
WSUA, with its studio present-
ly located in lower Brubacher
Hall on the Alumni Quad, pres-
ently broadcasts with a 25 watt
transmitter. They estimate that
this transmitter enables them to
reach at least the 1,400 stu-
dents on Alumni Quad clearly.

Q They are presently in the pro-

cess of building a 100 watttrans-
mitter, to replace the 25 watt
model now in operation, so that
the WSUA signal will be “the
stronges and best sounding” on
the Alumni Quad radio dials.

Eater WSUA has been exper-
iencing some hum and distortion
due to this telephone line, and
has on order a new telephone line
to replace the old one, in order
to correct these difficulties.

University Debaters

Two University debaters will
argue with a touring Britishteam
Wednesday, October 18 at 7:30
in the ballroom of the Campus
Center. The proposition is Re-

IFG to Present
'Ihat Man irom Rio'

Tomorrow night the interna-
tional Film Group will present
Jean-Paul Belmondo in one ofhis
funniest roles, in ' ‘That Man from
Rio." ,

since Godard's “Breathless”
(to be shown by the lFG next se-
mester), Belmondo’s fame has
been steadily rising, until he is
now recognized as one of the
finest contemporary screen ac-
tors.

“That Man from Rio” is a
comic blend of slapstick and
adventure thriller. Belmondo’s
role has been called a "combin-
ation of Humphrey Bogart and
Harold Lloyd." The headlong
pace of the action never lets up
- a frenetic chase using cars,
boats, planes, skyscrapers acro-
batics, and incredible derring-do
by Belmondo.

"That Man from Rio" will
be shown at 7:00 and 9:15 in
349. Since it is an unusually
expensive film for the lFG to
rent, admission will be $.35 with
student tax and $.50 without.

tics is no” pursuit at all.

The British team is compos-
ed of a graduate of Cambridge
and a graduate of Dublin. Both
men have won high honors in
English competition.

This tour is sponsored and
arranged by the Speech Assoc-
iation of America and the Com-
mittee on lnternational Debate
and Discussion. The program is
sponsored locally by Debate
Council and the Department of
Speech and Dramatic Art. V ’

Dean 0. W. Perlmutter ofthe
College of Arts and Sciences will
host the debate and moderate dur-
ing the presentation. One of the
University debaters willbestrat-
ton Rawson, a junior history maj-
or with two years of varsity de-
bate experience.

Jeff Mishkln. a member of De-
bate Council and president of
Student Association, will be the
other University debater.

 

 "expectations,"
.tngs " and "standards",asfound,

:. lem of the University dress code
’ was largely a matter, of inter-

tion; such words as “code,”
"understand-

in , "Student emotion," were
interpreted to mean manyt'nings.

There are some students who
feels dress code is unduly re-
strioting. Some feel it is too
conservative. other shidents
consider it illogical to state stan-
dards of dress which should be
left to the individual rather than
trying to specify what is, and
what is not appropriate.

Last year there were various
interpretations on the rest-
dence quadrangles. Towards the
end of last year, Waterbury Hall
on the Alumni Quad, voted down

’ the accepted school dress code.

The rationale for this move
was that many of the men par-
ticipating in sports or studying
in more comfortable attire be-
fore dinner objected to chang-
ing back into school clothing.

Last year Phil Franchini of
Waterbury felt that maintaining
the school dress code should

. be "up to the individual.”

Brubacher Hall, also on the
Alumni Quad, upheld the code
until February when the‘ code
was slightly relaxed. it was found
that due to the extremely cold
weather, female students were
wearing slacks to classes.

Because of the skirt regula-
tion in the dining room, women
would have to change to slacks
after breakfast. Rather than take
the chance a missing the bus,
many would skip breakfast alto-
gether. At that time, the Bru-
bacher hall government voted to
allow slacks to all breakfasts.

On the Dutch Quad last year
the accepted dress code was
largely upheld. it was slightly
relaxed on weekends and during
exam time but overall, Dutch
Squad was found to be more
strict in its interpretation of
the dress code than the other
quads.

On the Colonial Squad for the
first time last year, the dress
code was interpreted as a stan-
dard rather than as a rule or
regulation. Whereas rules and
regulations can be enforced by

fication'and explanation  -

many colonial  '
were under the impressicndthst. I
the dresarcodewaa'no longer -.

the attitude that they were not
breakingrulas but just‘not “liv-.
ing up to University em-
tattoos."

The clarification has been

toward the school dress code.
Living Area Affairs Commissitm
(LAAC) will try to achieve this
unity among the Quads. ,

As its chairman, Bob Mulvey
said, "LAAC's contribution to a
uniform dress code rests with the
¢expectations written up in “stu-

en Gu . ‘

The res 53.3% staff,whiohsup-
ports student government, now V
feels that the dress code should
be interpreted as an expectation
rather than as a regulation; how-
ever, it appears the residence
staff and student government will
continue to encourage studentsto
adhere to the dress code as it
appears in “Student Guidelines."

Maria Johnson

Frosh President

Maria Johnson was elected
president of the class of ’71 by
virtue of a run-off election held
by the previously selected Fresh-
men Council members on Mon-
day, Oct. 2. Andy Trudeau as-
sumed the office of vice presi-
dent.

A spacial Frosh Council vote
was necessary after Trudeau
and Miss Johnson tied for the
presidency in the Freshmen class
elections.

Jay Hershkowitz, on the fol-
lowing Friday, delivered a plea
for financial backing for the
Fresh Drama Council and secur-
ed funds amounting to $200 from
the Freshmen treasury. The
theme for the Homecoming Day
float was discussed and result-
ed in a decision to pay tribute
to the Green Gremlin nickname
of the Freshmen class.
