’ly about is the problem of'paid govern-
‘ment agents infiltrating E University com-
munity in order to win the confidence of,
and then piece in jeopardy the members
of this community.

Probably the most famous examples
of these infiltrators are the agents of the
CIA and the Federal Narcotics Bureau.
The CIA agents come to campus'to sniff
around for any subversive goings on, and
then report their findings. Often the agent
ferrets out the names of individuals con-
nected with 'questionable' organizations
and submits lists of these people to the
Government. . .

lt is known, as demonstrated by a case
in Brockport last Spring, that these inform-
ers appear not only in student ranks but
also on the professional level.

We believe the whole idea of infiltra-
tion is immoral. it not only denies the
founding philosophy of a university
community, the right of both individual
and institution to dedicate themselves to
free inquiry, but it also walks over the
rights and security of an‘individual as
a citizen.

it is immoral because under this sys-
tem individuals are placed under jeopardy
by secretly obtained information which
the victim may know nothing about. it
gives unwritten approval of keeping se-
cret files on the ‘questionable' ones;
it gives us Big Brother.

Can we condone government use of
these individuals today? We think not.
The, only place we could possibly con-
done it is in a case pertinent to the
maintainance of National Security. We
seriously doubt that the work of 505 or
NSA chapters warrant classification as
such.

But National Security is a thing many
people get really uptight about. There
still seems to be a strong trace of Mc-
Carthyism in the American mind. it fears
the great plots that will arise from with-
in if the government doesn't know what's
going on in situations. They get caught
in the trail of hysteria; they may not be-
long to, but cannot push the beliefs of
the ‘Minutemen’ and the John Birchers
from their minds.

We do not feel drug traffic is a mat-
ter of this caliber either. Much of the
information collected which deals with
marijuana traffic, would not he need-
.“ if it were legalized. Trafficing in
other state and local narcotics should
be handled by the police. We do not
feel the American people should be scar-

dress code (Page 2) in case anyone should
misinterpret our feelings, we thought we
should run a parallel editorial.

The most happy thought we have on the
dress code is that we can speak of it
once and forever hold our peace; not for
us the woes of LAAC and the residence
staff who fall heir to the hassle of run-
ning around all year trying to persuade
students to maintain the archaic ruling
as an "expectation." '

We feel that, enough "expectations"
are presently being placed on the Uni-
versity student (or on anyone else for
that matter), and doubt anyone serious-
ly believes they need this grief.

instead of watching the residence staff
“encourage students to adhere to the
dress code as it appears in ‘Student
Guidelines,‘ we would prefer to see them
encourage students that it should NOT
appear in "Student Guidelines."

Finally, and this makes everything right

' because it is a moral question, we feel the
dress code strikes true creativity. in
effect it sets a normative behavioral
standard of dressing on, but not off,

tive cut conscientious student a real hang

March Immoral
To the Editor:

1 am greatly disturbed by a.
notice in the Oct. 0 issue ofthe
ASP (page 0) ofsproposed anti-
war protest which is intanded to
dier operations of the Pants-
gon by "direct action." It is
difficult to comprehend how
thoughtful persons can partici-
pate in such an srrogantandself-
destructive procedure. I would
be the first person to speak up
for the right of protest if this
right appeared to be threaten-
ed, but freedom of expression
does not extend to the right of
sabotage (no poiiter word will
do). Here we have a minority
of our people (iuow large a min-
ority and how well intentioned
is irrelevent) who suppose to
usurp for themselves the oper-
ation of our Department of De-
fense. They mean to physically
impose on some 200,000,000
Americans their own ideas of
international morality; they are
going to ram it down our throats.

What could be more arrogant
and ssnctimonious? Their phil-
osophy seems to be: “We know
we are in the right; therefore
whatevar we do to carry out our
purpose is good and right." Can

flee the means? They are so
confident of their moral super.
iority, so positive that only they
and their fellows have the right
answer, tilt they are ready to
impose their will on the rest of
us by force. if this is not im-
morality, then wlust can qualify
as such?

in practical terms the short-v
sightedness of this group is al-
most beyond belief. By coerciug
others and preventing them from
going about their business they
will destroy the foundation ofour
own liberty. in the future any
group can claim the right to co-
erce others as it sees fit on the
grounds that its cause is just
—and this demonstration will
be the precedent cited. When
freedom of action under the law
is denied to one group (in this
case the United States military
establishment) there can be no
guarantee of this freedom for
snyhod . Wiust will be the basis
of sue a guarantee?

anti-war protesters have denied
to others the right of free ex.

it is a well known fact that'
the Russians have developed the
most efficient method of elimin-
ating enemies of the state. First,
the secret police infiltrate the
suspects, then, having gathered
evidence, the secret police turn
these offenders over to the regu-
lar authorities. Of course, such
practices are not condoned intho
United States of America; or are
they?

College cooperation

Many colleges throughout this
country cooperate with nar-
cotics bureaus by allowing in-
formers to operate among their
student bodies. President Col-
lins has formally stated that our
administration does not condone
the operation of agents on this
campus. These informers are
either incognito narcotics agents
or students who have agreed to
aid the authorities. The duty
which these informers perform
is to gather information which
may lead to the conviction of
narcotics users. My objection
is not to the law forbidding the
illegal use of drugs, but to the
use of such agents in obtaining
incriminating evidence. I do not
believe that such informers

should be allowed to operate on
a college campus. ‘
stifling influence

Personally, i feel that fear (1
such informers is a stifling in-
fluence upon free speech. A per-
son who is heard expressing his
views on the topic (1 drugs could
easily be suspectsddpossessing
such drugs if he were to speak
in favor of their use. it seems
that an informer is in a position
to cast undue suspicion on any-
one who has an opinion on the
subject. No one likes to feel that
his personal rights are being in-
fringed upon. to the case ofthe
presence of agents, fear of im-
plication can override aperson’s
desire to express an opinion.

Major voice

The college campus has always
been looked upon as the major
voice in arguments on political,
social; and moral ferment. The
existence of a type of secret
police organization on the col-
lege campus cannot helpbutstifle
somewhat the individual's free-
dom of expression. Freedom of
expression, on any subject, is
probably the most important pro-
requisite for any truly demo-
cratic society.

up in front of his face. Tad's
been busted and i can't help but
feeling sad and angry because I
know him and i knew it would
happen sooner or later. But never
to someone i know. It never does.
But tonight it was Tad. And the
whole thing is sad because i
know nobody's really going to
bother to find out anything about
Tad and that the cops are prob-
ably happy to get rid of these
long haired kids who use drugs.

But I know Tad and i know
that he's a good guy and iknow
his parents are hurt and his girl
too and all of us who know him
are hurt and sad for him. Be-

around by a lot of adults who
all of a sudden wanted to break
him like they would any other
adult.

But i know Tad and i know how
hard it is to talk to him and i
know he’s got problems and things
that worry him just like anyone
else. And if for a while he as-
capes with a smoke it's all right
because Ted's got problems. And
you can sit with your can of

things were.

Peace Corps
Degree Program

The Peace Corps and the State
University College at Brockport
have announced completion of
arrangements to extend and ex-
pand a unique Peace Corps-Col-
lege Degree training project
launched this summer.

A "highly favorable reaction
to this summer's pioneer venture
sparked the decision to enlarge
the program for 1968." This pro-
gram is ths first to make Peace
Corps training and service an
integral part of curricula lead-
ing to Bachelor's and Master's
degrees.

Candidates will be selected
from the rank of students in good
standing at an accredited college
who are completing their sopho-
more or junior year by June,
1068. Those selected will be able
to earn an A.B. or 8.5. degree
and be eligible for a Peace Corps
assignment in one academic year
flanked by two summers of fully
subsidized and integrated aca-
demic courses and Peace Corps
training.

All candidates will be expect-
ed to major in mathematics or
the sciences; those who have com-
pleted their junior year prior to
entrance into the program will
how the opportunity for double-
major.

At the and of the second sum-

mer armed with the degree, a
teaching lisanse, in-depth cross
cultural preparation and fluency
in Spanish, the graduates as
Peace Corps volunteers will be
off on their Latin American as-
slgnmsnt.

As members of the staffs of
teacher training institutions and-
or consultants to secondary
teachers of mathematics or sci-
ence, they will serve mainly as
participants in the educational
development efforts of their
host countries.

During their two year sojourn
they will have the opportunity
to earn up to twelve semester
hours graduate credit.

“This integrated program is
based on our two-fold conviction:
(1) to combine the collage and
Peace Corps experiences is to
make both \more relevant and
meaningful and the personal pro-
duct more valuable (2) to provide.
muchvneedad skilled specialists
-- mathematics and science
teachers - as Peace Corps vol-
unteers in Latin America is to
make a significant contribution

dent Albert Warren Brown, of

What kind of liberalism is it
that refusu to allow the oppo-

is right and necessary, but only
for those who agree with us."
Free speech, like freedom of
action, cannot be guaranteed to
anybody unless it is guaranteed
to all; and those who complain
that the government is trying
to silence them (as if it had tint
power) are themselves often guil-
ty of denying free speech totheir
opponents.

on Washington represent the
guardians of our freedom, mor-
ality and peace, then Cod help

soon be on a very steep and
slippery road to Hell. That this
road is paved with well-known
"good intentions" will only make
it more slippery.

Rosenberg Criticism]

To the Editor:

in an article describing his
summer college planning exper.
fence in last week's ASP, Mr.
Michael Jay Rosenberg right-
fully points out the need for a
strong and liberal student govern.
ment here at SUNYA.

However, i must vehemently
oppose his statement that ours is
a form of"non-government,"and
I raise the cry of irresponsible
journalism when he flatly states
that "Our Student Association,
Mysksnia (sic), andCentrleoun-
oil are run by the kind of in.
dividual (sic) who would fit in
rather well as welhpaid lackeys
in the Albany Democratic Ma.
chine."

i cannot see how Mr. Roach.
berg can say that a government
which has over the last year
effected such major policy
changes as a lifting of the ban
on the use of alcoholic bever-
ages on campus and a complete
overhauling of women's hours
is a nonfunctional entity.

And in the same progressive
manner, the inauguration andim-
plementation of s Mental Health
Telethon — the first of its kiusi
on any college clmpus. Surely
this event would never have
occurred without the support of
our "non-government."

But the thing that annoyed me
the most was Mr. Rosenberg's
attitude in a telephone conversa.
tion we had the evening after
the article appeared. ‘

l objected to his reference
to individuals as being "lackey-
like" when he admits to having
no personal contact with any of
the individuals he was daridiog.
Mr. Rosenberg feels that when
he reads in newspapers and hears
in bathooms is sufficient evi.
dance for his name-calling.

With the argument that the
article was his own personal
opinion and that he is just a typi-
cal student expressing his views,
Mr. Rosenberg felt that he was
pet fectly justified in his deroga.
tory comments. He said that if
things change to make him change
his mind, then he'll write another
article in a different light.

i must question Mr. Rosan-
berg's moral character — not
to mention his journalistic "in-
tegrity" —- if he feels that the
newspaper is a proper place for
expressing his personal preju-
dices and drifting character in-
sights.

With his blatant intolerance
of our student government and
student leaders, may i recom-
mend a college of the future for
Mr. Rosenberg —- perhaps one
at Westbury l..l., -- where Ros-
enberg - sly e Utopia (or Euuphor.
is) may pr‘vail.

Mary'uana Hassle

To the Editor: .

it is clear to me that your
editorial of October 5 on legal-
izing pot was written without any
deep thought or research. You
argue that since oursociety unar-
kets alcohol andcigarettes, which
are psychological crutches, why
not add another? After all, two
wrongs make a right, don't they?
(i am not an ultra - conserva-
tive wishing to see the reestab-
lishment of prohibition, for l in-
dulge quite frequently. However,
I disfavor the psychological de-
pendency that cigarettes and
sometimes alcohol produce).

A superficial examination (1
this problem would indicate that
marijuana should be legalized;
for the process involved in con-
sumption is identical tocigarette
smoking but not harmful, and the
effect is similar toa "good high"
from alcohol, without its con-
comitant hangover. However,this
is where your probe ended.

Doesn’t it make you wonder
why a commodity which adopts
the "good aspects" oftwo ac'cept-
ed and legal practices while be-
ing devoid of its bad aspects
should be illegal? Perhaps marl-
juana is illegal not only because of
its effect but also because of the
motivation of its user.

lndulgers in not desire to “put
on a head." This is the sole rea-
son for its use. The vast major-
ity of alcohol consumers indulge
for the sheer enjoyment of its
taste and only a small minority
drink beyond the saturation point.
The volume of beer sold at pro-
fessional baseball games is enor-
mous, yet one finds few drunks
in the park.

The next obvious question is,
"So what's so terrible about a
good high?" in an articlein “The
New York Times" on Septem-
ber 26, 1967 (“Marijuana Held
A Public Hazard,"), Dr. Henry
Brill, a psychiatrist who is cur-
rently the director of Pllgram
State Hospital on Longlsland,de-
scribed marijuana as a "harm-
ful and dangerous substance" that
should be prohibited as a "has-
ard to public health." He elab-
orated that "the unrestricted
use of marijuana type substan-
ces produces a significant amount
of vagsbondage, dependency and
psychiatric disability. it tends
to remove a significant number
of producing people from society
and make them dependent." Dr.
Brill stated that while marijuana
smokers normally experience eu-

P , and great self-satisfac-
tion; re are sometimes other,
undesirable reactions which

occur. Dr. Brill cited the follow-
ing reactions: ‘

1. Severe bouts of anxiety.

2. Psychiatric disorders, such
as sudden psychotic changes in
persons using large doses for
a long time.

3. Possible clouding of mem.
cry.

4. Loss of desire "to do."

Now if marijuana could be
purchased as a box or a carton
of cigarettes, it seems obvious
that many people, particularly
pressured college students,
would seek escape into this state
of euphoria “1”. While the first
three reactions cited by Dr. Brill
are sufficiently harmful, the
fourth would probably be most
detrimental to society, especial-
ly to the college student, for the
college years should be those
most characteristic of lntellec.
tuai and physical vigor.

While i see nothing wrong with
an occasional indulgence in marl.
juana, i cannot imagine its leg-
sliration without widespreadcon-
sumption and the reactions just
discussed. While you propose
that it could be distributed
through agencies under regu-
lation, etc., i fail to see what
good this would accomplishother
than possibly acquitting previous
users who were busted. Exposing
marijuana to the public or to
part of it is only provoking trou-
ble, for it will arouse many conu-
sumers who would not now suc-
cumb to its influence. it is so.

Editorial Note.- It appears to
us it is Mr. Gross who he
been thoughtless concerning
the ediforiol.Anyone giving
anything more ihon'o casual
perusal to it wouldreolise
that the point we are most
concerned about is not the
relative merits o/ the mori-
juana us. the alcohol cop out;
nor are we basing our argu-
ment on the relative morality
o/ legalizing another means
[or the same and. What we
are concerned about is the
[random 0/ the individual to
'li/c, liberty and due pursuit
of happiness.‘ We feel this
is ﬁle moral question involu-
ed.

We repeal: "We feel that
if someone elects to smoke
marijuana either occasion-
ally or habitually it should
be within their legal right to
do so. The peace of mind
and/azure 0/ too many people
are buzing rndongomd un-
der the prosan law. To us it
is_o matter 0/ individual
liberty."

May we also add that Mr.
Gross, in the article cited
from the Sept. 26 'New York
Times“ ncglnclod to read the
ortu'cln for enough down to
tho place where, Dr. Brill,
under cross examination,
was [brood to concede that
"long term pay/colic breaks
due to marijuana have not
been Monti/it'd in this
country."

Grad Stu. Needs

To the Editor:

In regard to your article in
the October 5th issue of the
ASP, 1 would like to thank you
for the information presented
to the undergraduate students.

However, i would like to clar-
ify the major points conce
the foundation cf a Graduate stu-
dent Council. lt is natural for
the graduate students to expect
a kind of social 'and intellectual
program in a growing University
Center. This need was discussed
last year by many graduate stu-
dents and a graduate student or-
ganization named Circle 20 was
established for this purpose. Due
to this organization's interaction
with many graduate students and
the university administration, the
need was felt for a university-
wide graduate student organiza-
tion.

A Steering Committee was sat
up including four graduate stu-
dents elected by Circle 20 and
four faculty members to suggest
a plan for a university graduate
student organization. This Steer-
ing Committee is expected to
articulate its suggestions and
to present them to the graduate
student body for more discussion
and approval.

The content of tile drafted con-
stitution will be communicated
to all the graduate students be-
fore the end of this semester
and more details could be pub-
lished later.

in a university center with
3,000 graduate students, it is
expected that this human wealth
will contribute to the growth
and the happiness of this schol-
astic community.

Finally, i would like to say.
what was done or what may be
accomplished is a collective and

cooperative effort of all the grad-
uate students and the Graduate
student Committee . . . and so,
i will and with my last remark.
. . . that there was no individ-
ual leadersz as the ASP edi-
tion stated in the same issue.
