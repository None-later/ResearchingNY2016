ECS Service Aids Students

A new service for students
seeking financial aid to attend
college has been announced by
North American Educational
Computer Services (ECS), lnc.,
of Princeton, New Jersey.

According to David Christman,
President of ECS, the service will
employ a computer to match an
individual student’s qualificap
tions to the requirements of over
700,000 items of nation scholar-
ships, grants, loans, and other
forms; of assistance contained in
the computer's memory bank.

The ECS service, which was
demonstrated at the National Edu-
cational Association Convention
in Minneapolis, on July 6, 1967,
is smajorbreakthroughinfinanc-
ing college education. Until the
advent oi computer technology,
the task of locating financial
assistance for which he qualiﬁed
was nearly a physically impos-
sible task for a student, Mr.
Christmas noted.

“The sources for all the
scholarship information, if they
were available in one place -—
and they’re not — would fill
over 000 feet of book shelves,"
he said. “in fact." Mr. Christ-
man added, “last year, edueap
tionel authorities estimate
over $80 million dollars in
available scholastic aid went up:

The ECS computer has been
programmed with over "00 mil-
lion in scholarships, grants-in-
aid, and followehips available
from colleges, universities,
fwndatioas, professional. bus-
iness, social, civic, trade and

labor organizations, corpora-
tions, religious organizations,
and federal, state, and local gov-
ernments all over the country.
Not all items are dependent on
high scholastic standing or on
financial need, but upon various
other qualifications established
by the donors.

dents should call Mr. J.T. Mc-
Grath at (201) 775-6661.

.‘centered around two mementos

of interest. First, if a student is
a known user of narcotics and
then arrested on a, narcotic
charge, whether this would effect
their status in the University.

President Evan R. Collins at
last Monday’s President's Con-
ference for students stated there
is nohardandfsstpolicylnthis
area. He felt that "the individual
is the first coucern."lnaddltion,
there is a consideration by the
University which services, es-
pecially legal matters, can be
used to side the individual on a
narcotic charge.

students are lurked as to
whether‘a certain offence would
lead' to a discontinuance of
studies, and if the student health
or welfare will be endangered.
However, the University must up
hold the existing laws although
considerations of the other sti-
pulations dten lead to decisions
in favor of the student.

students were also concerned
over policy on allowing narcotic
agents to infiltrate the student.
body secretly. President Collins
stated absolutely that the admin-
istration does not condone, or
allow any secret agents to in-
filtrate the student body.

Durilw the t summer, the
NAS, National Association ofStu-
dents, drew-up two resolutions
on the subject of drugs and its
usage. One resolution dealt with
universities'and drugs specifical-
ly while the other was directed
at society at general.

The first resolution was
“Guidelines for Campus Drug.
Policy." in brief this states the
following. First, that the student
cmvlcted of drug usage or expos-
ed as a drug user not be alienat-
ed by the university.

Second, that educational in-
stitutions refuse the entrance of
undercover agents or any other
type of law enforcement agency
with the purpose of exposing and

    

  

  

convicting am, users. A t

government and ‘other campus
groups provide legal assistance
for any student accused oflusing

‘A final resolution was the es-

the need for the establishment

proposal advocated that student"

ad of three major parts. First,
that narcotics use ba treatedasa
health problem .not- a criminal
offense. Second," that the sale of
Cannabis be permitted and regu-
latedrather than prohibited.

Finally, these imprisoned for
the possession of Cannabis on
groimds that they were using it,
present in the same area with
Cannabis or for-possession of
Cannabis have their sentences
commuted.

Also, advocated was the estab-
lishment 0f psychedelic centers
in which persons desiring to use
psychedelic substances may do
so under safe and controlled
ccnditlais.

Collins Discusses

Dr. Evan R. Collins, Presi-
dentoof the University, defined
the University’s policy concern-

,ing students facing civil or

criminal charges. This topic re-
sulted from a question concern-
ing the University's non-involve-
ment in the recent arrest of five
University students.

Collins stated that the Uni;
versity is willing to help any
student if it is asked. if ashident
calls from the police station the
adminstration would be williruto
finds lawyer, inform theparents
or arrange for bond to be posted.

The President pointed out that
the University will not pay for
lawyer’s or any other fees. He
also stated that if the University
is not asked to help it will not
meddle in the student’s affairs.

Collins said that the University
will no longer stand between the
student and the person who
charges him of a crime. in the
particular case of a recent
‘bust' which the president was
.questioned about, the University
was not asked for aid.

When asked if the University
will do anything about the stu-
dents involved in the bust last
week, Collins replied that it will
depend whether or not the Uni-
versity is asked for aid. As of

Student Arrest Policy

yet, the administration Inflows
only what they have read in the
papers or heard on television.

The president stressed the fact
that. the University will always
treat eacbstudentasanindlvidual
andnotasavictirnoiahard and
fast group policy.

in reference to a statement
made by Rep. Joe Pool, D.-Tex.,
Collins discussed freedom of
speech in a University. Pool said
in a news conference that uni-
versities which permit Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS)
on their campuses should not
receive federal mnds.

Collins replied that people can-
not be “blackjacked” into super-
ficial patriotism and that dissent
cannot be equated with dis-
loyalty. He added that you cannot
stop dissent by dollars.

in regards to Pool's threat,
Collins said that it was not
serious and that the University
receives very little federal
money. Most federal money is
given to the University in the
form of research grants.

The President's Conference
with Students is open to anyone
in the University Community. It
is held every Monday afternoon at
2:15 in the Patroon Room Lounge
in the Campus Center.

The American string Trio, artists in residence at the University. performed well in

concert in Page Ilall Monday night.

 

 

Profile: in tiePerfominy Arts

by John Webb

 

 

For those who were in the mood for chamber
music, if one ever is, Monday evening's per-
formance by the American String Trio would
probably have satisfied their longing. The mem-
bers of this performing ensemble are artists
in residence here at the University. They are
Marvin Morgenstern, violin; Karen Tuttle, viola;
and John Goberman. cello.

Marjory Fuller, our department's voice in-
structor, assisted the trio in its William Schu-
man number along with Helen Miles and Car-
men Pane, "New York artists" (whatever that
connotes). The concert was performed for a
sizable audience, still terribly deficient of stu-
dents. .

To open the evening, the trio performed Franz
Schubert’s "Trio in B flat major. It was by far
the weakest .part of the evening. The Allegro

' moderator distinctly lacked a. sense of unity

giving it a very choppy and unsteady quality
particularly in the smooth ﬂowing phrases. l
was given the impression that they were fight-
ing each other.

Second movement

This worked itself out much better in the
second movement which featured a viola solo
which was very precisely played with a light
and delightfully mellow quality. The fourth move-
ment was the best, having finally the necessary
unity particularly on the very interesting mov-
ing parts. The cello, however, reigned supreme in
this number, opening with a very light mellow
tone, and developing into a strong reverberat-
ing tone at the end. Unfortunately the violin
stood out in many respects. He was too loud,
lacked the preciseness and interpretation possess-
ed by the others, and slid rather sloppily from
phrase to phrase. In addition, his up and down, and
backward and forward movement was a bit too
much!

The second work performed, and without doubt
the best of the evening, was William Schuman's
terribly difficult “Amaryllls,” a very contempo-
rary piece composed in 1964. This hadan extreme-
ly impressive opening with the viola and cello
playing the same theme in unison. Both moved
with excellent intonation and unity as well as
generating very stimulating feeling.

Poor Upstaglng

The violin entered with very soft, smooth,

ﬂowing notes, but unfortunately forgot himself

again and proceeded to poorly upstage the other
two players. There were times when I knew
that the cello and viola were doing a beautiful
job of interpretation and I just wished that the
violin would tone down or be quiet all together.

Entrances, although very difficult, were beau-
tifully executed, and the plucking of the strings,
sometimes at odd intervals, was very good and
efficiently done. They were assisted in this num-
ber by the three singers who came on the stage
for the last movement, forming a trio of female
voices. Our Miss Fuller was the only one who could
produce a tone without seeming to have some
sort of internal difficulty.

The result was, however, quite adequate. Des-
pite my rather severe criticism, the work was,
as a whole, very well played, particularly in
view of its obvious difficulty. Miss Tuttle reso-
lutely kept the beat with her foot and signaled
the other two with her how, and all went well.

Following intermission, Beethoven’s "Serenade
in D major” closed the performance. This was
very well performed, demonstrating excellent blend
of tonal quality and uniformness of interpretation.
In the Adagios, the viola and cello had the lead
and were again outstanding, the violin was still
up to his old tricks.

Well Performed

The Menuetto Allegretto was a well perform-
ed movement, particularly characterized by the
sfortzando entrances which were very clear-cut
and concise. Throughout this number, the melodic
blend was delightful. After the Andante quasi
Allegretto, the Marcia Allegro brought the
Beethoven number to a very well played ending.
The crescendos were particularly good, and the
sense of unity and blend were perhaps the strong-
est here of any time during the concert.

it is very easy to criticize such work, but when
doing so, and when judging the comparative capa-
bility of each artist, we have to keep in mind the
fact that a chamber group is not a symphony or-
chestra. No mistakes or shortcomings are hid-
den in music such as that performed Monday.

These performers have to learn to live, think,
and breathe together what they are playing or
trouble will begin immediately. Without doubt this
trio did just that quite adequately, and although
there were many weak points as l have pointed
out, the concert, as a whole, was quite well per-
formed.

The paintings and sculpture
from the Nelson Rockefeller

_ Collection, currently apps

aring

in the new Art Galleryinthe Fine
Arts Building, presents a striking
noun, strong enuigh to compete
with the awesome hall and turn
it into a vibrating, lively ex-
perience in art and architecture.
Especially, 'on the second level,

' where the expense ofwhite wall

above the hanging area is so

1 great, it takes a large or power-
ful piece of art to achieve any
significance. The Rockefeller
works achieve this.

There are 58 paintings in the
exhibit, only six of which date
from before World War ll. There
are works of the known, thelittle
known and the unknown, from
Picasso and Braoue to Oslo and
Hinman.

lidon Varied styles

Their styles arewidely varied,
including cubism, neoplastlcism,
semi-abstract and abstract im-
pressionlsm. The only example
of pop art is the eight foot square
painting and college by William

. Roberts called “Use Ford New
York, ldaho Up.”

This was done in 1965 as aplatp
form decoration: for the podium
upon which Rockefeller spoke in
his visit to ldaho in that year.
The Governor liked it so much
that he bought it for his collec-
tion. The design intertwines the
shapes of ldaho and New York
State, with a large photograph
of Rocky extendim from Potsdam
to Poughkeepsie, and is profuse
with stars and stripes.

stimulating Textures

As you walk into the gallery,
the first thing you bump into
(sometimes literally) is a large
wooden scultpure entitled
"Galaxy" by Frederick Keisler.
This work was originally part of
the scenery for a ballet at the
J uilliard School called "Le Pau-
vre Matelot,” or "the Poor Sail-
or," and indeed, the forms and
texture of the sculpture are very
reminiscent of the sea.

The sculpture is made of sea-
like lumber, the spikes of sea
urchins reaching up from its
sloping bases; originally the
spikes on the top were draped
with sea weed. The tall, extend-
ing forms look like fishes sup-
porting the horizontal beams in
their mouths. And, as they reach
up, they draw the eye to the
upper level of the gallery.

The painting "Navigo" by Rio-
hard Lytle (who, incidentally, is
no relation to the associate di-
rector of the gallery, Mrs. Chari-
les Liddle. as was reported in
one of the local papers) is clos-
er in its ties to the l'Old Art”
than any other work lathe collec-
tion. But for the abstraction of
the forms, the color and move:
ment might, at a glance, be taken
for a late Reubens or a Fra-
gonard.

The warm pinks and greens
and blues of the canvas are pure
Baroque, with all the excitement
and frenzied emotion of that
period.

Named after locomotive

The Franz Kline is one of the
artist’s later works, a painting
named, as most of his are, after
a locomotive. The title, "Corin-
thian ll" is merely a means of
identification, rather than pro-
viding a clue to meaning. Kline
did his successful paintings ex-
clusively black and white, his
violent black brush strokes
jutting across the large can-
vasses, the, very essence ofab-
stract impressionism.

lt is interesting and rather
sad to note the hushed atmosphere
which prevails in the gallery.
This gallery is for the students,
and should be an integral part of
campus life and the widening ex-
perience with which this campus
is providing us.

Every student should come to
know and feel at home in our
gallery, which will be presenting
many exhibits throughout the
coming year. We hope you will
come and enjoy it — out loud.
