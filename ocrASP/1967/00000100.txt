That the Boulting Brothers'
The Family Way(Delaware Thea-

be attributed to a quality. rare in
cinema these days: strong char-
acter writing. Bill Naughton,
whose screenplay for Alfie was
that film's biggest asset, has
here composed a mellow piece
about the family tensions that
surround a young couple’s initia-
tion into love, sex, and marriage.

Naughton’s dialogue captures
affectionately. both the com munity
warmth and the hard edge of
gossip that arises when the couple
are unable to consummate their
marriage. _

My one objection is that the
denouement strains plausibility
a bit. Naughton introduces acrude

to the real iseue of the film; the
final scene, asimple and touching

‘The Hunt' ‘

A note on "The Hunt," recent-
ly at the Troy Cinema Art: This
is a nasty little Spanish film of
great technical virtuosity and
tension about four men who set
out to hunt rabbits and end up
hunting each other. '

The cinematography, music,
and acting are all highly com-
petent, and reinforce the
brutality and sadism ofihe film's
allegory: ferrets prey onrabbits,
strong men prey on weaker men.

viewer saw the last performance

I 'Ilds show'

Henry is a kids show just as
"Birdie" was. Although Don
Ameche and Carol Bruce head the
cast, the show beings to three
young girls. They are Robin Wil-
son, Neva Small, and Alice Play-
ten. Miss Wilson is the real star
of the show. Despite the fact that
this is her first professional eo-

‘ gagement, she projects a stage

presence unequalled in childper-
formers. And Alice Playten, a
veteran of "Gypsy" and "Hello

of the theatre. Her first act

The story line, as with most
musicals, is sketchy but who

young girls who find in Henry

via a blood pact, to follow him »

wherever he goes. This part of
the action reaches its apex atthe
end of the first act when the girls
have followed him to his apart-
ment and have accidentally
brought with them the New York

TryOuts
Announced For
‘AddingMachine’

Auditions for “The Adding
Machine" will be held Oct. 16,
17, 18 at 7:30, Richardson 291.
Martin Mann, who has done“5t0p
the World" and "Clearing in the
Woods," will direct this Univer-
sity Theatre producttm. The play
needs a fairly large cast and all
are invited to try out.

Of “The Adding Machine" it
has been said that. Elmer Rice
exposed "the starved and bitter
littleness and the huge universal-
ity of the Zero type, the slave
type. that from eternity to
eternity expresses the futility and
the tragedy of the mediocre
spirit." The slaves are “white-
collar slaves," willilu victims of
a world of repression and inhibi-
tion.

Copies (1 the script have been
placed on reserve in the Univer-
sity library for those who wish
to read it before the auditions.
Mann also announced that those
who wish to audition but cannot
do so at the specified times should
see him personally to his office,
Humanities 816, to make other
arrangements.

throughout America and England,
mounting exhibitions or original
prints of a range and quality
usually seen only in major
galleries.

The exhibition includes every
form of printmaking from hand-
printed manuscript pages and
music sheets, 18th and 19th cen-
tury prints from Europe, and a
comprehensive selection of 20th
century artists.

Selections include such artists
as Renoir, Degas, Manet, Tou-
louse-Lautrec, Picasso, Chagall,
Vasarely and Giacometti, and, in
addition, the equally important
masters of printmaking. Rou-
ault's “Miserare,” Picasso’s
"Vollard Suite" and Chagall's
“Daphnis and Chloe" are all
represented.

Finally, there is a selection
of colorful work by young con-
temporaries. The prices range
from $10 to several thousand
for the rarer examples.

The current boom in prints
has aroused enormous interest
both in the art world and the
press, and many artists today
are turning to printmaking, both
to reach a wider audience and to
answer the challenge of afresh
medium in which many new
techniques have recently been
developed.

For the discriminating col-
lector, who aspires to something
better than a reproduction, there
are sound aesthetic and com-
mercial reasons for buying
original prints. it is possible
to acquire a good example of the
graphic work of major artists
such as Picasso or Chagall for
a fraction of the price charged
for their paintings.

ords l have heard in a long time.
it has, of course, their hit song
"Light My Fire” which made it
big on the charts this summer.

“Light My Fire" is especially
good, not only because a lot of
people seem to think so, but also
because of its marvelous instru-
mental interiude in the middle
of the song. Although this makes
the song almost six minuteslong,
the time is worth it. The rigid-
ness of the rock beat plus the
free-wheeling melodic line make
the interlude one of the most re-
markable things done in rock and
roll in along time. The organ,
which carries the melodic line
in the interlude, is played in a
way that make this instrumental
very close to less.

“Alabama Song" ("Whiskey
Bar") has a good arrangement.
You get the impression that
you're on a psychedelic Merry-
go-round. You feel as though the
carrousei were on a tilt and that
the world is turning shut the
ride rather than the other way
around. The lyrics also con-
tribute to the mood along with
a mandolin-like sound to give
a carnival atmosphere to the
song. The rhythm, the words,
the instrumental make this a
really marvelous smug.

Another song on the album,aad
one which is probably most typi-
cal of “The Doors" and their
"sound," is “Twentieth Con-
tury Fox."

The problem with the album
is that, first, many «the usage

ly, the lead vocal is not one of
the best contemporary and third-

an eleven minute imitation of
"Light My Fire" which falls
to come off. Despite this the
album is worth buying because
of the group's fantastic organ-
ist and a good background sound.

by Robert B. Cutty

Since the customary period
of grace has now ended, it is
time i undertook an honest apv
praisal oi the Fall, 1967 tele-
vision season. This will be un-
dertaken in a series (1 weekly
articles, each of which will deal
with the idea that this new sea-
son is, without doubt, the worst
in American history.

My personal favorites among
the new shows are always the
comedies, so i will concern my-
self this week with the six new
situation comedies that made
their TV debuts about a month

0.
as ‘Good Morning World'

CBS' "Good Morning World"
is an obvious attempt to repeat
the success of “The Dick Van
Dyke Show." its hero is a young
comic disc jockey who makes
fun of his young, pretty, kooky
wife during his show. (Van Dyke
was a TV comedy writer who
wrote gags for his series in
which he kidded wife Mary Ty-

from a truly unique problem:
trite, sentimentality. The hus-
band-wife team of Richard Ben-
jamin and Paula Prentiss are
marvelously funny as yet anoth-
er variation (1 the Van-Dyke-
Moore combination, and Broad-
way’s Jack Cassidy is uproar-
ious as a conceited fairy.

What this show tends towards,
though, is a well-soaked handker-
chief. The audience, however,
is not expected to laugh itself
into tears over the jokes but,
rather, over the implausible dra-
matic situations that will crop up
each week.

ABC's "The Flying Nun” is one
of TV-land’s biggest disasters,
and a stunning insult to modern
Catholicism as well. The unfunny
premise is that a young nun in
Puerto Rico gains the miracu-

lous power (1 free flight.
Miracle to Frighten

Every week, our heroine uses
this miracle to frighten someone
into converting and helping or
giving something to the Church.
This says little for the mental-
ity of modern Catholics, iorl

' doubt that the binding faith of

Catholicism is fear, fraudulent,
hypocritical belief in a phony
"miracle" of little spiritual sin-
cerity. Catholic faith is founded
on something far more substan-
tial than a sham 'flying nun.’

NBC’s "The Mothers-in-Law"
stars Eve Arden and Keys Bal-
lard, either one of whom will
provoke wild laughter, while to-
gether they inspire outright hys-
teria. Unfortunately they have
few comedy gems with which to
work.

ler Moore in various ‘ ‘ “

But, the new-found stars of
'Worid’ are not Van Dykes or
Moores. Billy de Wolfe as the
harassed station manager tries
to convey some sincerity, but
he never seems to take his role
seriously and, in the end, the
entire show seems flat.

What 'World' needs, besides
good acting, is talented comedy
writing and strong comedy direc-
tion, clearly lacking in ABC's
"The Second Hundred Years"
as well. This one concerns a
prospector who, after a long
period of frozen incarceration
in a glacier, revives and finds
himself living with his somewhat
elderly son in a rather bewilder-
ing twentieth century.

Monte Markham, doubled as the
prospector and his look-alike
grandson, is the show's worst
offendor. He loads each punch-
line with weighted witlessness,
then mumbles it in a dreadfully
corny Midwest accent that is
supposed to make up for his bad
acting.

THE
WORD

Is now accepting contributions
for its second Issue. The “rat
Issue has been completed and
will appear soon.

 

 

 

Early this year the word came
from across the sea that a new
English supergroup was being
formed. Eric Clapton, one of
England's finest guitarists. who
had, along with John Mayall,
brought the Yardbirds and the
Bluesbreakers into the pop spot-
light, was the figurehead of the
group.

Ginger Baker, former drum-
mer of the Graham Bond Or-
ganization among others, was in
on it as was Jack Bruce whoused
to be the bassist for Manfred
Mann. The group was tobeknown
as the Cream because they were
England's finest.

‘F‘resh Cream'

Their first album "Fresh
Cream" proved to be one of the
biggest disappointments of the
year for me. Here were three
of the greatest musicians in pop
circles gathered on one record,
and the result-nothing. l was
expecting something new, fantas-
tic, even revolutionary, but all
I got was some very poorly
written songs, mediocre lyrics,
and good instrumentation.

The Cream relies heavily
on the Blues traditions, but un-
like many of our own blues'
groups, such as Paul Butter-field,
their music doesn’t touch the
spectrum of emotional levels.
Joy is replaced by happy, de-
pression by sad, and sensuality
by heat. Their original material
is uninspired and void of any-
thing that could be called new.

The best tunes on the album
aren't even their own. These in-
clude the traditional number
“Cat’s Squirrel," "Muddy We»
tors," and "Rollin' and Tumb—
1111.”

America's Blues Heritage

It is a pity that Great Britain,
whose groups had reintroduced
America’s blues heritage to the
realm of popular music,now can-
not show us a higher culmination
of this musical form. Perhaps
the Cream is another one of those
groups which can't come through
on a recording but has to beseen
live to be appreciated; in any
case it‘appears the the "Fresh
Cream" has soured in its Atlan-
tic crossing.

Sldenote: Thanks to some ASP
typlst, 'Blood, Sweat and Tears,’
the new group formed by Al
Kooper and Steve Katz, became
a rising record. Both Kooper
and Kata were members of the
now defunct Blues Project.

“The Project'

In a recent interview Al Koop
or was asked why the Project,
which was one of the hottest
groups in the country, decided to
split. Basically, he said that
the original idea of the group
was commercial and so far they
had been the only commercial
group on the current scene which
had not had one single that be-
came a hit. Everyone in the
group had new ideas, but they
were all different so they de-
cided to break with each mem-
ber going off to do his own
thing.

Concerning the kind of music
the new group he and Steve Kata
were forming, Kooper only said

'that it will be a new type of

non-r & b soul sound. Hope-
fully, the new group with such
greatness of Kooper and Kata
will be nothing short of spec-
tacular, so keep an ear tuned
for Blood, Sweat, and Tears.

Now that he is home, he was
immediately booked into the Per-
sian Room with Ted Curson for
October 16 and 17. The Persian

the Menands Shopping Center out-
side of Albany.

i heartily recommend these
dates to any true jazz fan. You
have the opportunity to hear some
of the best jazz that the Tri-
Cities has to offer. However, if
you miss that date, you may
catch the group at Shelly's Mann
Hole on the coast. But, i would
think that the area performance
would be more in line with your
pocketbooks.
