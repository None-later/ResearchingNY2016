One editor of Marshall McLu-
han's “Understanding Media”
noted tint "seven‘ ‘ ty-five per cent

 of his book Is new. A succeuhll

book cannot‘ventureto be more
than ten per cent new." A good
'deal of the confusion and skep-
ticism over-‘v Prdessor Mc-
Luhan's ideas are, perhaps, er-

noun.- in terma or their or-

iginality. .llis short, explosive
sentences, his communications
lingo andst generalities make
it easy for some to neglect his
work as unfounded theatrical non-
sense. One man in the audience
at McLuhan’s talk in the State
Health Department on Oct.

stood during the question“ and
answer period, shrugged

h“,
shoulders and said: "When I get

home ’tonight my wife will ask
me what he said." Laughter en-
sued. McLuhan looked as if he
had seen that very same bald
head everywhere he had spoken,
and heard the same laughter.-
Littlernan

i ask this: Where was the lit-
tle man when McLuhan was speak-
ing? His message to the audience
that night was terrifying. Pro-
fessor McLuhan predicted that
in the next ten ‘years we will
undergo a large scale depres-
sion, certame as bad as that of

the 30s. And the grounds for his'

prediction were to my mind quite
solid. in ten years the members
of our generation shall have
entered the’ work force, the work-
a-day world. If the values of this
world are repulsive toour gener-
ation it will be rejected obvious-
ly. It has indeed begun.
TV generation
We are the TV generation. As

members of the TV generation '

we are involved in depth, Mc-
Luhan says; and going rapidly
to the East (to Buddha if you
will have it). Like little Fuller
domes we want to be involved
in a total environment, total art.

Literate man

Literate man, says Prdessor
McLuhan, is fragmented and spe-
cialized. He views the world
usually from his one window. It
would seem that we are getting
away from an age I! specialize-
tion and fragmentation. This gen-
eration and succeeding ones will
want a total involvement with
their environments, while, at the
same time they will want to in-

equ in a more meditative n-

ward world.

The Greatest

ALBANY, STUDEN assess?

Mr. Brian V. Kelly never had the opportunity to swim competitively because, the
schools he attended never had a swimming pool. As the University of Albany's new
swimming coach he awaits the completion of our first pool. Scheduled to be ready some
time. in Decembet. he is anxious to put his optimistic plane into operation for the coming

year.

Coach Kelly hopes that
by the fall 1968 season we
will have an intercollegi-
ate team. This year the
swimming y team will
operate on a club basis.

Meets Dr. Counsilman

Born in Oshkosh, Wisconsin
in 1930, Mr. Kelly was origin-
ally a Personnel Management
major, receiving his B.B.A. from

the University of Wisconsin.
After achieving a as. in
Secondary Education Mr. Kelly
made a fateful decision. He de-
cided to enroll in physical educap
tlon program at Indiana univer-
sity where he met the famous
Olympic swimming coach Dr.
Councilman. It was through his
guidance that Coach Kelly de-
veloped as an instructor.

Large Student Turnout
Mr. Kelly expressed delight

Golf Team In ECAC;

' Women Tennis Compete

The SUNYA golf team participated in the autumn
ECAC Tournament last weekend. The tournament, held
in Syracuse, consisted of such Eastern universities
and colleges as Buffalo, Canieiue, Colgate, Hamilton,

and Niagara.

Arising to the top ofthis
big-time competition was
Colgate with a team score
of 302. SUNYA made its
best showing ever in this
tournament with a four-
teenth place finish.

Craig Luther led all SUNYA
linksters with a fine 79. Luther
was followed by his teammates
Gary Turton, 80, and Bill Fender-
gast, 84. Ray McCioat, hampered
by a sore thumb, chipped in with
an 86.

Chris Rich of Colgate Univer-
sity led all individuals with an
outstanding 73. Rich's perfor-

‘lthaca, Syracuse, St. Bonaventure, Syracuse, Clarkson

mance aided in Colgate's record
breaking team total. The runner-
up, Canisius, was a distant eleven
strokes behind with a team total
of 313.

The tournament was the second
in two weeks for the Great Dane
golfers, who are playing a heavier
fall golf schedule than ever be-
fore.

The intercollegiate women's
tennis team has not remained
idle either. Entered in the
Eastern Collegiate Women’s
Tennis Tournament at Forest
Hills last Friday, Chris Robin-
son defeated her Fairleigh Dick-
inson opponent.

at the fact that 30 students turned
out for the first meeting of the
swimming club. He hopes tohave
about five meets this season
beginning in January.

Besides utilising the pool for
swimming lessons and for Red
Cross, Mr. Kelly believes in the
feasibility of using our lake to
teach canoeing and possibly sail-
ing. In addition, he wants to in-
clude a water polo club and scuba
training in the near future.

Brockport who finished with 87.

On Monday the trash hooters
spotted Sullivan to a 2-0 first half
lead and then outhusiled the
opposition for the final 44 minutes
only to fall short by a 2-1 count.
Tony Salvo accounted for the Al-
bany goal when, at 21:43 of the
