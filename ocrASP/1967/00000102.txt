against the AMIA. Dr. Werner, who I feel has done an
outstanding job at this university, took offense at what
1 wrote. Before a class of students, the Doctor proceeded
to tear apart my column. Although when I heard about
this, I wasn't completely overjoyed, certainly none of
our rules were broken because of the dissection. But the
Doctor did indeed break the rules. While presenting what
he felt was valid evidence as to why the better official
can not be procured for AMlA, and while he presented-
other facts "disproving" me, he failed to mention my
point concerning the rule disallowing varsity lettermen
from later competing in,that sport on the intermurai
level. The only defense for that rule is obvious but

- whether it is justifiable or not is in question.

There are three complaints against this rule:
1) The administration shouldn’t infringe on student

rights .

2) Fraternities get more prestige for SUNYA rather
than AMlA stars. Don’t worry about fraternity pressure.

3) If a student wants to study and play a less time con-
suming intermurai sport, let him.

"SWarthout Steals w

by Dunc Nixon

With senior forward Gary Swartout leading the way the Albany State booters evened

periods.

‘ their record on Saturday with an impressive 3-2_win over Adelphl. Swartout put on quite
as show as he accounted for all three Albany goals, scoring in each of the first three

_At 15220 of the first period Gary took span from Getachew Habteh-Yimer on the left

side and drove the ball pastthe goalie for the score. Adelphi’s ’l‘om Caranicholas evened
the score with a goal early in the second qharter, but Swartout put the Danes back on top
as he hit a looping header into the upper left hand corner. The shot, which came off a

corner kick by outsidevright Phil Kahn, gave the Great Danes the edge, until Caranicholas
drilled the ball into the left corner of the nets, a mere 1:30'before the half time gun. But
the Great Danes opened the second half with an early score, and then simply wore the
Adelphi hooters down to a walk. '

At 4:06 of the third period Albany scored on a beautifully executed play. Habteh-Yimer

crossed the ball from the
right side all the way
across the goal mouth to
Craig Springer, who then
headed it back toward the
middle, to Swartout who
scored easily from close
range.

The Danes didn’t just
fall back and play defense
thereafter, but rather
they kept steady pres-
sure on the Adelphl goal,
thus making it easier for
the fullbacks to stave
off the infrequent Adelphi
thrusts.

The squad played well
together Saturday, and the of-
fense seems to be coming around
quite well. The front line of
Kahn, Swartout, Habteh-Yimer,
and Dennis Jersey consistently
outraced the Adelphl fullbacks,
while the Albany fullbacks John
Compeau, Joe LaReau, Roger
Saul, and Tim Jursak kept Adel-
phl from pressuring goalkeeper
Jerry Leggieri.

However, there is still some
stiff competition coming up on
the schedule. This Saturday the
Great Danes travel to Potsdam,
where they will face a rugged
team that will be out to avenge
the 2-0 upset beating that State
inflicted upon them in last years
Homecoming encounter.

2nd In LeMoyne Invitational,
Attwell Leads The Charge

The Albany State Cross-Country team registered its second win of the year Wednesday
as they defeated Montclair 23-38. This victory brought their record to two wins and one
loss for the year and increased their overall record to an amazing forty-five wins and
only five losses, an outstanding record for Albany and coach R.K. Munsey. Albany again
dominated the top positions in the race as seven of the first nine finishers were Albany

runners. t

The Albany barriers
were again led by Mike
Attwell and Paul Roy, as
Attwell finished the
course in 25:51 behind '
Jim Harris of Montclair
and Roy followed Attwell
across the line at 26:21.

by Greg Kicrs'l.

Saturday morning approxi-
mately 250 people, filling dozens
of cars and two buses, will leave
Albany for Washington to confront
the "warmakers" and to demand
an end to the war in Vietnam.
The Albany contingent will join a
projected 50 400,000 Americans
in a mass rally and a march to
the Pentagon.
Three chartered buses havebeen
secured by a group of University
students who have co-ordinated
themselves with the Student
Mobilization Committee in New
York City. The buses will leave
Colonial Quadrangle and the
corner of Partridge and Western
at 5 cm. Saturday.

One bus will return Saturday
evening and the other will stay
the night in Washington andleave

TwoRadio Directors Alleged

WSUA Victim of Censorship

Two members of the WSUA
staff reported an alleged attempt
at censoring of WSUA, the radio
station, in regards to reporting
of the pantry raid held on the
Alumni Quad Wednesday, Oct. 21.

The students, WSUA's Pro-
gram Director Rich Stevens, and
Music Director Skip Fisher re-
ported that Thomas W. Wilhelm,
a new member of the Student
Activities Staff, threatened to do
everything in his power to see
that WSUA would "be off the
air tomorrow" if they carried
out plans to broadcast up to the
minute news of the raid.

Wilhelm stressed that news of
the panty raid not be put on the
air at that time, because liwould
influence too many other stu-

dents to attend, especially those
who might be tempted to come
down from the new campusto add
to the confusion.

At a meeting between Wilhelm
and WSUA staff members held
Friday Wilhelm denied that he
had said anything In the form ofa
threat, and was merely present-
ing a suggestion which was back-
ed by other members of the
Students Activities Staff in the
interest of the students.

Stevens and Fisher, who were
the only staff members present
at the time, still maintain that
Wilhelm lodged a "direct, and
emotional threat" against them.

Fisher also noted that they have
been having trouble with Wilhelm
over what he considers to be

a criticism

"obsoenities" broadcasted by
WSUA.

At the time of Wilhelm's visit
it was decided by Stevens that
perhaps it would be best not to
broadcast in view of Wilhelm's
rationale.

At the time however, both re-
ported anger at Wilhelm's in-
trusion, but felt that in this case
they would give theStudent Activi-
ties the benefit of the doubt, and
retain what they until then had
considered harmless informa-
tion.

Any attempt by Wilhelm to
coerce WSUA staff members
would have been in directopposi-
tion to the University's policy on
not censoring any student com-
munications.

Any censorship offered by the
University consists of defacto
directed at the
organization in error. Technical-
ly the only way force would be

Active Resistance

Six months ago the march in
New York City was one of pro-
test; Saturday, the march will
move towards resistance. Thou-
sands of Draft age men will
march under a banner "Hell
N0 —— We Won’t Go.”

April 15th encompassed no
plans for civil disobedience;
Saturday, hundreds of peoplewill
participate in “non-violent civil
disobedience" by blocking the
five entrances to the Pentagon
in an attempt to "disrupt the
core of the war-machine.”

On Oct. ’7, a representative
of the General Services Admin-
istration, the police, and
Pentagon authorities, announced
that "under no circumstances
would the government allow
picketing of the Pentagon."

The statement added that per-
mits for the Oct. 21 march and
rally would not be issued unless
the Student Mobilization Com-
mittee (SMC) publicly renounced
its intention for some persons to
engage in peaceful direct-action
at the Pentagon. At that time the
SMC unanimously rejected this
ultimatum.

However, Sunday the govern-
ment retracted its ultimatum,
and issued a march permit; there-
fore those msrching, but not
participating in the sit-in at the
Pentagon, will be within the law.

Permit Granted

The government's original re-

fusal to issue a permit forced

the Committee to change rally
points and March time. Two rally
points were planned but have
been reduced to one mass kick-
off rally at 12 p.m. at the Lin-
coln Memorial.

The March to the Pentagon
will begin at 2 p.m. and activi-
ties at the Pentagon will begin

Political Action
Probe to Sponsor

March onSaturday

The members of the Political
Action Committee and Probe will
sponsor a march in Oneonta
Saturday to coincide with the
mobilization being held in Wash-
ington, D.C.

Because Oneonta is " centrally
located in New York State, the
march will enable those unable
to attend Washington and New
York to participate in this move-
ment."

The Oneonta march, which has
obtained a permit to mobilize,
will start at noon. All participat-
ors will meet in front of Old
Main, on East street in Oneonta.

From there the march will
proceed through the center of
town and will end in a mass rally
in Wilber Park. All events will be
over at approximately 6 p.m.

lf lodgings for the march are
necessary, contact either Geoffe
David or Skip Crumb at area
code 607-432-3763.

Display of Graphic Arts
At Campus Center Today

A quality exhibition of original
graphic art comprising etchings,
lithographs, woodcuts and silk-
screens of important and out-
standing artists will be on view

and for sale Oct. 19, Main
Lounge, Fine Arts Bldg.
For over a year, London

Graphics Arts has been visiting
universities and colleges
throughout America and England,
mounting exhibitions or original
prints of a range and quality
usually seen only in major
galleries.

The exhibition includes every
form of printmaking from hand-
printed manuscript pages and

music sheets, 18th and 19th cen- ‘

tury prints from Europe, and a
comprehensive selection of 20th
century artists.

Selections include such artists
as Renoir, Degas, Manet, Tou-
louselmutrec, Picasso, Chagall,
Vasarely and Giacometii, and, in
addition, the equally important
masters of printmaking. Rou-
uult's “Miserere,” Picasso's
“Vollard Suite" and Chagali’s
“Dauphhls and Chloe" are all
represented.

Finally. there is a selection
of colorful work by young con»
temporaries. The prices range
from $10 to several thousand
for the rarer examples.

The current boom in prints
has aroused enormous interest
both in the art world and the
press, and many artists today
are turning to printmaking, both

to reach a wider audience and to
answer the challenge of a fresh
medium in which many new
techniques have recently been
developed.

For the discriminating col-
lector, who aspires to something
better than a reproduction, there
are sound aesthetic and com-
mercial reasons for buying
original prints. It is possible

to acquire a good example of the
graphic work of major artists
such as Picasso or Chagall for
a frzcihn of the price charged
for their paintings.
