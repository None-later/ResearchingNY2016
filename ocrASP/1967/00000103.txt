LAAC ToRunPoll

Central Council directed Liv-
ing Area Affairs Commission
(LAAC) to conduct a poll to stu-
dent opinion concerning the pay-
ment of room and board.

The representative sampling

will deal with the separation of
payments for Iroom and board
and the desirability of a third
meal.
The fact that the general stu-
dent body has been grumbling
about the present system has
been known for a long time.
This is the first action Central
Council has taken to resolve the
problem.

The separation of the pay-
ments is one of the major pro-
grams of Jeffrey Mishkin, pres-
ident of Central Council. Once
the poll is taken, LAAC is to
present the results to Central
Council.

ries," and most recently “Per-
sona"—-all have testified to his
great fertility .of imagination.

"The 81101100,” perhaps his
most difficult work, deals with
two sisters who, in the course
of the stay in a small foreign
town, draw farther and farther
apart until all communication
ceases.

The matter is thrown into even
sharper focus by one sister’s
young son, his nightmarish en-
counters with a group of dwarfs,
a lecherous waiter in their hotel,
and some of the most erotic
scenes ever put on film.

Bergman’s brilliant techni-
que is buttressed by his content:
he is one of the few directors
today who genuinely have some-
thing to say, and say it in a
profound work of art.

“The Silence" will be shown
at 7 and 9:15 in Draper 349.
Admission is $.25 with student
tax, $.40 without.
