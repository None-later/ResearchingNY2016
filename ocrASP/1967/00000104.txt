It lshhopsd by theSMC that
civil disobedience will continue
well into Monday, when there will
be a huge workshiit, and dis-
ruption can be most eiiective.

The SMC is organizing and
currently training 2 - 4,000 Mar-
shals to maximize eiiectiveness
and to minimize corihlsion and
violence. Wednesday, Mr. Robert
Baty, a representative item the
New England Committee ior Non-
Violent Action, spoke to Albany
march participants. Albany will
be sending several Marshals (all
oi whom will be wearing identiti-

cation armbands) to the march.

This march is expected to rank
with .the largest civil dis-
diedience actions in American
History. The risk exists that
the demonstration will end in
major violence.

Provocation or violence with
marchers are suspected to come
largely from two sources: Right-
wingers who may deliberately
instigate coniusion, and police
or armed iorces who through
tear or contusion may attack
demonstrators — especially
those engaging in civil-dis.
obedience.

The SMC thereiore has issued
a statement that thoseparticipat-
ing in the march oiier outside
groups "neither the opportunity
nor the satisiactionoiagitation."

. ALBANY Sworn nﬁéis‘ “

by Barbara Bernstein

The book, "Politics and Re-
iorm in New York," by Univer-
sity proiessor Dr. Robert Wes-
ser, is part oi the result oi an
ambitious research project
undertaken by a member oi the
isculty at Albany State.

Doing his undergraduate work
at the University oi Buiialo (be-
fore it became part oi the state
University oi New York), Was-
aer did his graduate work and
took his Ph.D. in American his-
tory at the University oi Roches-

er.

His chiei interest was 20th
century political history and
he minored in American litera-
ture.

Second Year

Now in his second year at the
University, Wasser has been
teaching and developing the
American Studies program. One
oi his courses, Problems in
American Civilization, is mod-
eled aiter the iamous one at
Amherst College.

American Studies courses
leading to a B.A. degree are be-
ing developed. Wasser has al-
so iaught History 100, Colloqui-
um in American Ideas, and re-
search seminars ior under-
graduate and graduate students.

Politics and Reiorm in New
York is a study oi the period
1905 to 1910 during which Char-
les Evans Hughes was the gov-

Security Police Understaffed

Still Preteet, Assist Students

by Tim Keeley

“Our purpose is to protect
and assist students and college
personnel in making our campus
a safe place," siatedChieiJames
Connolly, head oi the campus Se-
curity Department.

Currently there are twenty-
ilve oiilcers in the security de-
part ment. This includes the chiei,
three sargeants, and twenty—one
patrolman. 0! these, only seven
are pence oiiicers; that is they
have attended the state police
institute in I-‘armingdale, and
have taken courses in police
science.

Chiei Connolly remarked, " As
a rule our oiilcers play no major
part in making arrests. However
we do assist the local and state
police in apprehending ielons."

Power to Arm!!!

Only the seven peace oiiicers
are legally capable at making
arrests. The remaining oiiicers
may apprehend a ielon, but must
call upon local authorities to
make the arrest. These cases
are turned over to the local
courts.

ii a minor violation is com-
mitted, the security police take
no action other than reporting
the incident to DeansorrellChes-
ln. These cases are handled

through his oiilce.

The campus iorce is also sup-
plemented by members at the
Burns Protective Agency. Cur-
rently there are live such men
on the University campus.

During special events the iorce
is bolstered by additional Burns
oiiicers. At present two oiiicers
are guarding the Rockeieller Art
Exhibit. They protect the works
oi art from vandals and thieves
by taking a complete inventory
at the objects at a regular in-
larval.

Other Duties

The duties at a security pat-
rolman go beyond that etc "cop."
The patrolman are also concern-
ed with iire saiety. The security
department is in charge at build-
ing inspections, ilre drills, and
ilreviighting equipment. As an
added precaution, many oi the
patrolman have also completed
courses in ilrst aid.

At present two obstacles seem
to be hampering the security

department. Not only is the iorce
undermanned, but the question oi
jurisdiction enters many cases.

The security department oper-
ates on three eight—hour shiits.
This means that each shiit is
manned by only eight oiiicers.
These men must patrol not only
the uptown campus, but the down-
town campus as weli. They are
aided by iour nightwatchmen.

Because part at the uptown
campus is outside oi the Albany
city limits, the security depart-
ment may have to call inthe State
Police. Thereiore they must do-
cide under whose jurisdiction 3.
crime is being committed be-
iore calling in either the local
police or the State Police.

Centering around Hughes, the
book represents an eitort to re-

Charles Evans Hughes was a
prominent iigure during the rec

the book also deals with Pres-

Wesser's book is in the term
oi a monograph; a scholarly stu-
dy oi a given subject or theme
in which a situation is analyzed.
Because oi its highly special-
ized nature, it would appeal to
proiessional historians, those in-
terested in New York State his-
tory, and researchers in this
particular iield.

panded it to cover the entire
Progressive Movement irorn
1905 to 1910?

However, seeing the impor-
tance oi Hughes as a reiorm and
political iigure, and the amount
at material, Wasser decided to
write it as a two - volume study.

Second Book

He now has most oi the re-
search done tor a second book
and is planning a third. Eventu-
ally his project wili span the
years 1905 to 1928.

According to Wasaer, his ma-
jor problem he encountered in
writing his book was the loca-
tion oi research materials and
the travel to use them since they
could not be borrowed.

He wrote to many historical
societies and traveled to a great
number of libraries. He is grate-
iul ior the generous iinancial
support irom the Research Foun-
dation oi the State University
oi New York.

The classiiied research issue
rocked the Minnesotacampus last

The Minnesota Daily has

The Air Force subsequently
cancelled the project. The rea-
son given was a “lack oi iunds"

In other action related to the
secret research project, the local
chapter oi the American Associsr

started a iull inquiry into secret

relates to academic ireedom.

Also, the Minnesota Student

urging the administration to "un-

A resolution directed to the re-
