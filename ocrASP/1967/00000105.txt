permit to march for Saturday’s peace
mobilization in Washington seems like a
belated action in view of the thousands
slated to demonstrate. Originally the de-
cision to withhold a permit was made in
hopes of discouraging an action holding
up the “mechanizations of the war ma-
chine" by cramming the Pentagon; how-
ever even now there is "0 question of
the legality in the Pentagon action; it is
a case of civil disobedience.

If they thought withholding a permit
from the march would discourage par-
ticipants they obviously underestimated
the will of the people,. as the government
seems to underestimate the whole move-
ment against the war.

We do not feel this weekend's march-
ing actions to be immoral; we feel that
a large mass of people who believe as
strongly as this about something as cru-
cial as this has no right to remain si-
lent. The fact that repeated peaceful dem-
onstrations have produced no cogent ef-
fects on the Administration has opened
the door for a newer, bigger, better su-
per-march such as this; the fact that the
Administration has repeatedly been ob-
livious to peaceful demonstrations has
also opened the door for a new innova-
tion to the peace march, the switch
from 'peaceful demonstration’ to an at-
tempt to 'disrupt' the mechanisms of the
government.

Critics of the march accuse the dem-
onstrators of gross arrogance in daring
to oppose the interests of the majority
by such an action. it has been called
sabotage by many. We doubt it will be
sabotage; it is not planned to destroy
the State Department, but rather to slow
it down a little bit and make it aware
of a very real presence.

it is doubtful that the Pentagon, which
runs wars so well, will not be able
to withstand the force of fellow Amer-
icans, especially with a few months ad-
vance notice oi the attack. in other words,
we doubt the Pentagon will suffer much.

Actually it does not appear to us that
a matter of this caliber, involving this
many morally committed Americans
can be denied the right of civil disobe-
dience (granted civil disobedience is not
a Constitutionally ,provided right); the
right of people to do everything including
breaking the law. to achieve an end which
may at least bring recognition of their
demand. Nothing revolutionary is ever
legal; however, in retrospect, people
learn to respect what people broke the
law to achieve (i.e. the American Revo-

 

 

lution).

Also the people who critize this minor-
ity most strongly for trying to impose
their will on others seem to forget that
these people, many of them draft age
men, are constantly having their will
imposed upon.

Our one feeling of regret is that it
does not. appear to be a wise action
although we uphold the moral commit-
ment involved, we do not feel the dis-
obedience will do much good. The Ad-
ministration will not change; probably
all that will happen is that much public
disdain will be incurred, and less co-
operation will emanate from the Ad-
ministration.

Censorship Blunder

last week an unfortunate breach of
University censorship policy was made
when an apparently uninformed newcom-
er to the Student Activities staff blun-
dered his way into WSUA broadcast stu-
dios, and demanded they withhold broad-
cast of the panty raid which was then in
session.

The issue which concerns us here is
the fact that a member of the Student
Activities staff should be so in error as
to his influence in determining the infor-
mation released by WSUA. Apparently
he thought he was justified; in fact he
was mistaken.

The University's censorship policy is
one of the most remarkable things of
the University. For all practical purpos-
es we can state that there is NO censor-
ship. No one higher than the student in
charge of a communications media need
ever see the material to be published,
or broadcast, for censorship.

There are none of the archaic faculty
advisors which'are the thorn in the foot
of many other student publications on
other campuses. For instance when an
ASP goes to press no one other than
the staff knows what will be printed.
The editorials, etc. are as much of a
surprise to the Administration as to
anyone else. All responsibility lies with
the students involved.

The only type of censorship which
would ever be offered is a de facto cri-
ticism. Theoretically only the Student
Association would, formally callan organ-
ization to task. The S.A. could vote to
suspend the operations of an organiza-
tion which was acting irresponsibly by
freezing its budget, but this would only
occur where irresponsibility had already
been demonstrated. '

The freedom of expression for com-
munications media here is mountainous.

Alternativu for 1968 is a fsv-,
' orits topic in the political, aca-_
demic and, intellectual circles
of our society. But it's not worth
‘the trouble — there are no al-

to vss.
‘ “it is not only that we on the
"now left" disagree with Lyn-
do‘n's foreign policy; it is that
we disagree with the present po-
litical framework it the Ameri-
can society. We wouldn't vote for
Lyndon against Nixon or for
Percy or for Join Kenneth Gal-
braith, and most of us wouldn’t
vote for Martin Luther King, Jr.

Why? Because those men, even
King, are so beholden to the sys-
tem that made them what they
are that they lack a perspective
on the problems that confront the
country today.

Liberal politics has failed to
recognize the seriousness of the
plight of black Americans, of-

 

!— fsring ideals of brotherhood-on

a picket line and then returning
to suburbia at night never to
know what it's like to have roach-
es in the cupboards and rats chas-
ing children.

Then as a response to the sud-
den awareness that 20-25 per
cent of the nation was living in
substandard conditions, liberal
politics initiated the poverty pro-
gram. Under the rhetoric of
"equal opportunity," fighting
poverty became the liberal solu-
tion to the poor — getting them
out of the cities into job corps
camps, giving teen-agers money
for cutting lawns under the Neigh-
borhood Youth Corps, teaching
the poor how to dress, look, and
talk middle class. The poverty
program seeks to up the poverty
while never really trying to learn
why there is poverty in America
and what kinds of changes are
needed to eliminate it. -

The mere fact that the poverty
porgram and its workers could
not support or engage in po-
litical activities points out the
lack of perspectivs in the liber-
al rhetoric. By excluding the

poor from the process by which
liberals believe. reform is pos-
sible, the poverty program sold
out the rhetoric of equality and
coupted the civil rights move-

ment.

it is liberal rhetoric that sends
the brother of the man who sought
the“ creation ofapoverty program
to the slums of Harlea to listen
to the poor. Yet listening is the
extent of Bobby's liberalism. He
fails to see the connection be-
tween his immense wealth, stat-
us and political power and the
jungle-like life of poverty, vio-
lence, and human degradation
(1 the ghetto. .

This is not to say that we
have all the answers; but we
are willing to act on what we
believe is right and wrong, while
Kennedy, Galbraith, Schlesinger
and company act on experiences
while feigning a pose of social
conscience.

It is perhaps because these
men are so successful in the
American system that they can-
not see its imperfections and
cannot take criticism and dis-
sent seriously. .

Perhaps because change will
jeopardize their success, they
try to hold off the forces of
change by throwing the dissent-
ers small portions ofthe big piece

of pie.

But liberalism has always been
wrong about the poor and the
masses. it has always been as-
sumed that it is because the peas-
ants are starving that they follow
those who call for land reform
and never consider that the peas-
ants, being human themselves,
like to be lord and master over
their own lives.

it is the servitude of man to
landlords, institutions, and gov-
ernments that brings about the
call for change. Until liberals
see that they are merely benevo-
lent despots, they are really no
alternative to the psychotic bull
in the world china shop we have
for a President today.

This weekend, University stu-
dents, slong with students from
across the nation, will partici-
pate in a peace demonstration
scheduled to take place in Wash-

gton. The outcome of such a
large demonstration occurring
in this nation’s capitol remains
to be seen.

Judging by the opinions ofthose
who are not avid followers of the
peace - through - protest move-

.ment, the resultant reaction to

such a gigantic demonstration can
only be poor to say the least. in
order to support this stand, I
feel that certain major points,
as stated in the letter written
by Doctor John, C. overbeck
which was published in last
week’s ASP, should be review ad.

The overall idea of the protest
movement centers on the supposi-
tion by a minority that its be-
liefs are arbitrarily correct.As-
suming these beliefs to be true,
the minority then attempts to im-
press its will on the majority of
the populace. Possibly the most
detrimental aspect of this typsof
movement is that the protesters,
in essence, a minority, will stop
at nothing to get their points
across to the public. in the name
of their so-called “right and just
premises," these protesters en-
gage in legal and illegal public

demonstrations.

Fr'ss expression and the right
to hear both sides of an argu-
ment fall to the wayside as the
demonstrators first present their
views, then stifle others who
would attempt to refute those
views. To quote Doctor Over-

’ back, “if the organizers of this ~

march on Washington represent
the guardians of our freedom,
morality, and peace, then God
help us indeed, for this nation
will soon be on a very steep and
slippery road to hell."

if you have considered at-
tending this forthcoming march,
please stop and analyze the over-
all impact of such a demonstra-
tion. Don't just go to the march
to have a good time; think first.
Then if you really believe that
any good can come of ademon-
stration which will be illegal,
go'and express yourself. Try
to consider all of the conse-
quences.

The power of the student is
probably the greatest force
affecting our country, and the be-
liefs of the majority of people
today will determine the laws
of tomorrow. As is aptly de-
picted in this week's cartoon,
uninformed protesters can do
nothing but make the overall
cause seem almost meaningless.

Supports M arch
To the editor:

According to his letter in the
last ASP, Professor John C.
Overbeck feels that war protest-
ors who attempt to "sabotage"
the war effort are immoral.

He feels, specifically, that it
is wrong to disrupt the opera-
tions of the Pentagon or to other-
wise inhibit the "freedom of ac-
tion" of those who are directing
the fighting.

Perhaps the professor is right;
we should not pretend in such
a morally ambiguous siluation to
know for certain whether he is or
isn't.

lla deludes himself, however,
if he thinks he has clarified
the issues. Nothing said in his
latter would be of any help at
all to a potential direct activist
who was trying to make a de-
cision.

Some of his arguments are
irrelevant and those which re-
main are inadequate to support
his conclusions.

When he says that there is
no "right to sabotage," he is
almost certainly correct. Obvi-
ously, no government can grant
people the legal right to resist
its own authority or to arbi-
trarily obstruct its activity.

But this is not the point at
issue; for after we have decid-
ed that a given action is illegal,
or even that it should be illegal,
we are still left with the whole
question of whether it is moral.

Even if we admit that the gov-
ernment's policies are made by
"the people" and that ioohatruct
them is therefore "arrogant,
we are left with the possibility
that to acquiesce in them may he
immoral.

People who feel that this is
the can now may be "arrogant,"
but that adjective is a far from
exhaustive description of their
position. Professor Overbeck
might have at least mentioned

the fact that they are willing
to go to jail.

Professor Overbeck is shocked
because the protesters seem
to think that "the end justifies
the means." i submit, however,
that sometimes the and does
justify the means; that both Pro-
fessor Overbeck and the Pentagon
realize this; and that the only real
question is about which ends
justify which means.

This can be seen readily if
we realize that both the Penta-
gon's crimes in Vietnam and
Professor Overbeck‘s acquies-
cence in them stand in need of
at least as much justification as
the actions of those whoars risk-
ing prison to stop them.

The Pentagon’s purpose is to
contain China. The professor's
is to be a law-abiding citizen.
if either of them is really wor-
ried about ends and means, let
them weigh these "ends" against
"moans" like napalm or frag-
mentation bombs.

Perhaps the former justify the
latter, although i doubt it, but
the fact that the question can be
raised at all demonstrates the
implicit assumption on all sides
that some ends justify some
means.

Professor Overbeck's final
comments about free speech are
quite accurate. Certainly free
speech means nothing if it does
not at least imply freedom from
heckiers.

But even if we are obliged
to recognize Mr. MoNamara's
freedom of speech, it does not
follow that we should permit him
total "freedom ofaction" at the
expense of the Vietnamese peo-

Die
Professor Ovarbeck's letter is
in general, a cogent statement
about what we have no legal right
to do, but does not help us do-
oide what we may have a moral
duty to do.

it seems like things could not
possibly be worse than they are
now. We are bogged down in an
endless war in Asia. Our great
cities are in turmoil. The White
House is occupied by a man few
can trust or even respect. So
we are upset and unhappy and are
filled with a sense of futility.
This, we think, is a terrible time
in which to be living. Wefeelthat
this generation is hearing a bur-
den unliks that borne by any
other.

Have we forgotten our history
so soon? Remember the hell the
last generation put up with. Bread
lines at home, rampant unemploy-
ment, millions of young people on
the road hitching anywhere tofind
work, and then waking up every
Sunday morning to hear liitler
addressing his mindless hordes
on the radio. A frightening hope-
lessness and despondency per-
vaded the American people.
Things got worse and our best
and most idealistic youth joined
left wing movements; thousands
were attracted by the Commu-
nist party. They let the govern-
munt know that they were not
going to put up with the system
much longer. And out of all the

yelling a program was born. An
American president felt com
pelled to yield to these kids and
slowly things changed. A pres-
ident had thousands of young peo-
ple come to his House and tell
him and his wife that it was
like and what they wanted. And
things got better . . .

An idealistic view of history.
Perhaps. But the fact is that
there is a lesson in this. The
late nineteen sixties is no time
to cop out. So .u of the very
best of our generation are tak-
ing the route of defeatism. They
are saying that they cannot worry
about the War and the crisis in
American civilization because
they are powerless and it all
hurts them too deeply. Now is
no time to quit. if our aestheies
and our idealists are going the
way of the hippy, then we shall be
left with the Philistines to de-
termine our destiny. At this point
in our history and our lives we
are sorely challenged. Any sem-
blance of faith in what America
could be (and once was) demands
that we try to effect a change.
As Shaw said: "Come my friends,
tls not too late to seek a better
world."

Wants.Jttdicial Capacity V

Edited by my McClost
Chairman 0/ MYSIMNI/l
MYSKANlA 67-88, in its third
meeting of the year last Thurs-
day night, passed a resolution
“to take' as its immediate goal
the assumption of the judiciary
function of the Student Associa-
tion and to review and rewrite
the judiciary section of the S.
A. constitution which would be
presented to Central Council and
in turn to the student body in the
form of a Constitutional referen-
dum."

This decision was hastened
by a clause in the S.A. consti-
tution which has prevented MYS-
KANIA from filling vacancies on
Supreme Court. Because ofthsse
vacancies Supreme Court has
been unable to function.

in trying to solve this dilemma
MYSKANlA observed many weak-
nesses in the judicial structure
of Student Association. These
weaknesses were manifest in last
spring’s handling of the election
bill referral. Also, as one MYS-

KANiA member pointed out,

"even after a $8,000 govern-

ment workshop Supreme Court

was still ineffective as a judicial
I!

YSKANlA realizes that "the
difficulties encountered by the Su-
preme Court are not the fault at
the individual justices, but rath-
er a result of the inherent flaws
in the present judicial set-up."

One problem MYSKANIA en-
countered lsat May in screening
applicants for Supreme Court was
that there was a shortage of
applicants." Therefore MYSKAN-
[A was unable to appoint the nine
justices in accordance with the
Constitution.

MYSKANlA feels that "the rea-
son for the lack of response is in
part due to Article lV, Section 5a
of the S.A. Constitution that re-
stricts Supreme Court Justices
from participation in student gov-
ernment activities on the board
level or above.”

This clause in conjunction with
Article IV, Section 3b, that re-

quires tint the justices be chos-
an from the Sophomore, Junior
and Senior classes, severely ra-
stricts upperclassmen from par-
ticipating in other activities and
is probably most responsible for
the lack of response fol-Supreme
Court positions.

Another restrictive factor is
the qualification requiring that
a Supreme Court Justice have
and maintain a 2.5 quality point
average. in addition, there is no
replacement clause in the judic-
ial section of the Constitutiu
thereby hampering the Court in
the event of a Justice's resigna-
tion or dismissal from the Court.

MYSKANIA will act as a com-
mittee of the whole in formulat-
ing a new judician structure for
the student Association. MYS-
KANlA invites suggestions and
comments from the student body
which should be addressed eith-
cr to MYSKANlA or _Ray McCloat
and placed in the Student Mail-
box located inthe Campus Center.

01w Salvation

This is an open letter to all
the non - liberal students who
grace the SUNYA campus. You
may be silent, but you are not
alone.

I want to raise my voice in
utter disgust over the so-called
"liberal" views that are given
a platform via the pages of our
student newspaper. in the latest
issue of the ASP dated October
5, 1967, article after article is
devoted to:

l) legalizing marijuana

2) a discussion of penalties
incurred by students who defy
the law by filling narcotics

3) an open panel discussion on
pro-marital sex

4) an editorial urging more
radical student participation in
administrative affairs of the Uni-
varsity

5) a call for volunteers for a
planned anti-Vietnam war march

0) a befuddled description of a
dream-like progressive college

’7) a report on the "crimes"
of the police and National Guard
during this summer's Newark
and Detroit riots.

indeed it would seem as if
someone’s prediction that
SUNYA will become the Berk-
ley of the East — (read into this
the pejorative meaning) —— is
about to come true but for the
one indsmnifying sentence which
i discovered on page 5:

"Our trouble is that the ad-
ministration of Albany State is
more liberal than the student
body."

This trouble will be our sal-
vation. Our strength lies with
the student body at large, and
i do not for one moment believe
that the people who write these
"liberal" articles and editorials
speak for the majority of the stu-
dents, nor do they speak for me.
We have other things to do here
on campus.

Fewer people have better de-
fined the task faced by university
students than the great Russian
writer, F.M. Dostoyevsky. in his
“Brothers Karamazov," referr-
ing to the 10th century breed of
radical, nihilistio students, he
writes: (in my humble transla-
tion) —

"But unfortunately these
youths often do not understand
that giving one’s life is perhaps
the easiest of all sacrifices in a
great many such motances; that
to sacrifice, for example five or
six years of one’s life, at a time
when it is boilingovar with youth,
to arduous and demanding stud-
ies, to science, it only for the
purpose of increasing ton-
fold one's own strength to serve
that same truth and that same
chosen purpose to which one has
dedicated himself, — that kindof
sacrifice many of them, very of-

ten, are almost entirely incap-
able of making."
Nadja Jernakoff

Rosenberg Again
To the Editor:

1 read that the Chairman of
Myskania has risen to righteous
indignation over an article writ-
ten by me on the experimental
new college at Old Westbury.
He takes offense at my refer-
ence to what I consider to be
SUNYA's form of "non-govern-
ment," and especially to my
comment comparing the leaders
of our student government to the
"lacksys" in the Albany County
Democratic Machine.

After speaking with the Chair-
man of Myskania for forty-five
minutes the other day, i find
myself even more certain that
the opinion i ventured is rea-
sonable. i shall not bother to
answer every one of the Chair-
man's specious allegations;
though false, they bear little
relevance to the situation. ltoo
remember my phone conversa-
tion with the Chairman. He was,
it seems to me, unnecessarily
upset that my reference to the
sloth of our student leaders
should be interpreted as a di-
rect attack on his person. He
needn’t have worried. A quick
survey on the Colonial Quad in-
dicated that less than one stu-
dent in every fifteen knows who
the chairman of Myskania is.
The most common answer as to
his identity was: "isn't it Bill
Cleveland or something." So the
Chairman should not feel threat-
ened. liis anotlomity is a sturdy
enough defense.

1 am hardly surprised that
the Chairman should be so un-
known. Myskania itself, as the
Chairman pointed out to me is
concerned almost exclusively
with "tradition." That seems to
be Myskanis's biggest problem.
it seems to exist merely to pre-
serve a tradition that is not whol-
ly worthy of preservation.

in the opinion of most State
students, Albany State’s "tra-
dition" began with the death of
Albany State Teacher's College
and the creation of the State
University at Albany. Does Mys-
kania realize that to over fifty
per cent of our students, the
words "Detroit Annex” comets
nothing? There are some five
thousand students here to whom
"Draper" is only the last stop
on the school bus route. We have
been plagued with the Teachers
College image for far too long.
it is time that Myskania realiz-
ed that most students here an-
rolled at a prestige State Univ
varsity not at an ivy covered
stats normal school. NYSCT is
dead and it seems to me that
Myskania is only a vaatiga of
that nonexistent institution. if
Myskania wishes to continue in

inierpeting its role as the mere
prasarvsr of tradition, than it
should either be abolished or
have all its present functions
placed in the hands of one per-
son; it would not take up much
of his time. i am sad to con-
clude that Myskania would not
be missed. its demise would
hardly be noticed except by a
few alumni from the class
of ’33.

But let me say that i am not
completely without hope as re-
gards SUNYA’s government. In
the past few days various and
sundry Myskania members have
assured me that at their last
meeting they heatedly discussed
the bookstore, the drug problem
and that column i wrote. Maybe
things will be getting better. And
one more thing: as regards my
anology between the lacksys in
Albany and our campus lead-
ers, the Chairman of Myskania
(for your future reference a cer-
tain Mr. Raymond McCloat) is
not alone in his anguish. l have
heard from a reliable sourcethat
a few of those lacksys in the
Albany Democratic Machine are
up in arms; they are angry and
disturbed at being compared to
Myskania members.

Marijuana Ago: It
To the Editor:

The ASP editorials of the past
have usually been concerned with
issues and policies of the univer-
sity, and hence did not nced much
substantiation, for an editorial
is merely an opinion. However,
when you advocate revision of a
national law or a moral, you
must present significantly more
information than you did when
you wrote on legalizing pot.

The problem you raised was

the imposition made onihe "free-
dom of the individual to life, lib-
arty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness." However, not every fed-
eral law is designed merely to
restrain the freedom of the in-
dividual; many laws rather are
designed for the protection of
the individual. This is why there
is an age restriction on drinking
and smoking. Perhaps this is why
you mentioned a possible age re-
striction for marijuana. l mere-
ly carried this one step further
because [believe that marijuana
can produce some deleterious
iongtsrm effects. if this is the
case, i further believe that the
government not only has the right
but the responsibility to protect
its people. (While l admittedly
stacked the cards in the article
i cited, it if nothing else, indicat-
ed the vast dissent within the
medical profession on the affects
of marijuana. Your “known
medical evidence" as an argu-
ment for its legalization is just
a little too flimsy for me.)
