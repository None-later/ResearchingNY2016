Thirteen Groups _

Last year's festival had
thirteen different groups per-
forming thus putting the State
Festival on the same level as
Newport, Monterrey, and New
York. An event of this magnitude
takes literally months to pre-
pare. Last year, we had exactly
three months to bring offthat
show. The worst thing about it
was that we had no precedent to
work with. -

We had'to start from scratch
and pretty near killed ourselves
in doing it. This is why. Linda
Llsik, Dennis Donahue, and my-
self know that more time is
needed. it just can’t be done in
three months, wheny'ou areworb-
ing with (and sometimes, against)
a system that is as bureaucratic
as ours is.

More important than the sys-
tem are the artists that are tobe
contracted for the festival. How
can anyone expect to hire the
better groups a any area of
music with just two month notice?
Many music groups have their
itineraries planned two years in
advance. And yet we try to book
them just two months inadvance.
Has the state University become
that much of a drawing card? Do

you know of any artist that is
clamoring to perform here? if
so, let Special Events Board
know about it.

‘ Other Events

i realize that there are other
events that take up time at board
meetings. But, when it comes to
selecting chairmen, just how long
can it take to pass out the appli-
cations and screen the candidates
for an event like the festival?
Are there really that many people
on this campus that are interested
in jazz, that knew jazz artists?
1! so, where were they when
tickets were being sold last year?
i certainly couldn't find them.

All i am asking is that the '68
chairmen don't have toput upwith
the many headaches t 1twe had
to cope with last year. Give the
chairmen a chance to give this
university the best possible in
a jazz festival.

in the Assembly Hall this weekend in a dramatic read-
ing version by the University Readers‘ Club. The cut-
ting. of thenovel for oral interpretation was done by
the club’s adviser, .Mr..Robert Fish. . j

The 1927 satire on organized fundamentalist re-
ligion was a controversial best - seller, praised by
the atheist columnists led by H.L. Mencken, damned
on every pulpit in the land. The majority of the lit-
erary critics of the time objected to the inhuman por-
trait of Gantry as comically unrealistic. in the modern
day of the’antihero, the novel has gained a new follow-
ing and is howof Lewis' most popular widely-read
Socks. '

Cast in the lead as Elmer Gantry is Evan Wilson.
This play marks Wilson's first association with drama
at the University. He is a junior and business adminis-
tration major and comes from nearby Guilderland
Center.

Alex Krakower, president ’of the Readers’ Club,
is the narrator. A senior English major, Krakower
has vast dramatic experience. He has previously per-
formed in the Readers' Club Christmas and Spring
shows, as well as several State University Theatre pro-
ductions, among them “Ethan Frome," “Dr. Faustus,"
and "Merton of the Movies." ‘

Robert Clayton, a senidr drama major, will play
the part of Judson Roberts, an evangelist preacher
modeled on the great "hellfire and damnation” preacher
of the 19203, Billy Sunday. A forerunner of today’s
Billy Graham, Sunday was a former Chicago White Sox
baseball player. Clayton has worked with the Coopers-
town Summer Theatre and has been seen in “Lysis-
trots," 'Merton,‘ and "Carnival,"

Stratton Rawson, a junior history major active in
Readers’ Club activities and another former cast mem-
ber of ‘Merton,’ will enact the role of Dr. Quarles,
a college president. Transfer student Andy LaPatra,
a senior public address major, will be seen'as college
student Jim Lefferts.

Admission to the performances is free. The show
will last no longer than 50 minutes and will begin prompt-
ly at 8 p.m.' The Friday and’Saturday night perform-
ances, Oct. 20 and 21, will both be presented in the
Assembly Hall of the Campus Center.

Rice's expressionist drama
is still a bone of contention for
literary critics.

The lead character of Zero
is a primary source of confusion
in interpreting the drama, Zero
is a pathetic human being for
whom one ,w0uld like to feel
sincere pity; but instead, one
despises Zero for being the hap-
less ctpherhe is, a reject from

,the factory mold, a broken cog

in the eternally running engine.

Here is the difficulty: if we
sneer at Zero’s historically in-
evitable predicament, are «we
to assume the play is a comedy?
Or, does the fact that we feel
a remote sense of clucldng sor-
row ior Zero’s weak,stupid help-
lessness make the play a tra-
gedy'l

The AMlA League ,1 football season got off to its start this week with all five of the
teams seeing action. The season‘opener saw defending champion Potter Club thump
the Node, 27-12, in a game not as lop-sided as the score might indicate. Next, Kappa
Beta, with an abundance of new talent, white-washed Theta Xi Omega by a convincing
36-0 score. Monday, Potter Club and Alpha Pi Alpha struggled througha defensive

0-0 duel.

One 'other game saw
the Node make their first
victory a sloppy 12-0 vic—
tory over TXO in which
all the scoring was done

in the second half of play.

Touchdown passes to Denny
Wykoff, Ray McCloat, and Jim
Waibel gave Potter Club all the
points it needed to nullify the
Nads two touchdown bombs to
Jim Gutowskl and Bob Veeck.
.llm Curley, besides being on
the firing end of Potter‘s scor-
ing plays, reached paydirt him-
self as he took a Nad punt all
the way for the score. Jack
Burrington unvealed his prolific
foot as he made good on three
of four extra point attempts.

Potter did not find the going
as easy, however, in its next
outing as Curley could not move
his offense all the way against
the AP-A defense. Likewise,quar-
terback Gary Torino could not
take his APA offense to psydirt.
EEP's three main drives were
all stalled two by Torino inter-
ceptions and one by an onerous
clipping penalty. The game, how-
ever, was not decided until the
final play of the game which left
Potter Club deep in AP.A terri-
tory.

KB, in an attempt this year to
regain the league title, started
off its campaign with a convinc-
ing victory. Rifle passes by Blue
and Gold quarterback Dave Gold-
stein took his team to victory.
0n the receiving end of the ser-
ial bombs were ailstar Phil For-
tin and Rich Patrol. The KB de-
fense was outstandinginpreserv-
ing the shutout.

F rosh Harriers Edged
Soccer men Also Fall

The Albany State freshmen did
not fare too well this weekend
as both went down to defeat at
the hands of two-year schools.

The baby harriers put up a
tremendous fight against Coble-
skill A&T on Monday only to fail
by a close 26-31 margin. The
Great Danes ran very well, but
Cobleskill, now 7-0 was simply
too deep in talent.

chleskill’s Jeff Green came
home first in a record breaking
time of 18:25.7. Albany's Larry
Frederick was close behind at
18:42, also ahead of the pre-
vious course record of 18:47.4
for 3.5 miles.

Albany’s Pat Gepfert was
fourth, sandwiched between two
Cobleskill runners, while Don
Myers, and Jay Kaplan finished

sixth and seventh respectively.
Kapian» ran especially well, as
his sudden burst at the finish
carried him past a pack of four
Cobleskill runners.

The fresh hooters traveled to
Mohawk Valley on Saturday. The
team seemed to suffer a letdown
after their fine opening perfor-
mance last week. Mohawk scored
once in the second period and
then twice in the fourth for a 3-0
win. Fullbacks Larry Bopp and
Alan Rosenberg played well but
the team just failed to jell in
this one.

The fresh hooters hosted RPI
on Wednesday, and willbetravel-
ing to Oneonta on Saturday, while
the frosh barriers will return to
action onMonday when theytravel
to Adirondack C.C.

The Albany Siatebaseball team
opened its fall schedule Satur-
My with a double - header at
the University of Massachusetts.
The Great Danes and the
UConns split the twin bill, as
Albany took the opener 2-1
while Massachusetts came back
2 cop the second by a 7-0 mar-

n.

George Webb worked the first
4 innings of the opener to get
credit for the win. Rich Bar-
deschewski mopped up with three
innings of hitless ball, while
Jack sinnott provided all the
scoring punch that was needed
when be powered a two run,

375 foot homer to deep right
centertield.

The Great Danes did not fare
so well in the second game, how-
ever, as they were effectively
shut down on one hit, a hunt sin-
gle by Paul Leonetti in the first.
Rich Patrei and John Lamendola
split the hurling chores for
Albany.

This is the first year that the
Albany baseball squad has par-
ticipated in fall baseball, and
the Bob Burlingame nine will be
opening its home schedule Satur-
ay with a double-header against
Springfield beginning at 12:30

p.m.
