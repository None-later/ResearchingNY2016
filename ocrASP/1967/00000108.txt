. . R: l(. Munsey‘s Great Dane Harriers showed their strength once again as they soundly
3 defeated the cross-country team from Rochester institute of Technology, last Saturday.
The. victory was the fifth for .the Munseymen against one defeat. That defeat came
against the Coast Guard Academy in SUNYA’s opening meet of the year. Since then the

Albany harriers have recorded five straight victories including a sweep over Platte-—
burgh and a triangular victory over R.P.l. and Siena. ’
