on Dutch Quad and the recent
repetition of Oct. id'on Colonial
ouad created mitefthsn a big

, More i” ' _ ,_ ,
‘ . iected by? occurrences are
‘ asking why it happened and what
is being, done to prevent another,
such'outbreak. ' .

'Ofcourse immediate blame is .

placed on Food Servicewhenever _
such an outbreak occurs, and
seems to be the direct target
oi all attacks by the people in-
volved. ~.

’ For example, oiapproxlmate-
ly 1,100 students eating dinner
Oct. 4, those who claimed that
. ‘American chop suey' (a. con-
glomeration oi macaroni, tome.-
toes and ground meat) was the
cause of their distress compris-
ed a 104 name petition on Dutch
Quad. All signers claimed they
became sick as a result at that
meal, and demanded immediate
action.

Another incident, on Colonial
Quad, when, pork chops were
served Oct. to, resulted in an
outbreak onaconsiderably small-
er scale. Reportedly 19 people
were aiiected at that time.

Mr. Malcolm Coebiey, head oi
Food Service, replied to a query
concerning the intensive State
and County Health Board investi-
gations, that the iinal report con-
tained "Cause: Unknown."

Since samples from every meal
are required to be taken, the
samples from both meals inques-
tion were available, but yielded
no conclusive iniormation re-
garding the cause oi the out-
breaks.

ltegarding the possibility oi
excessive germs on silver, glass-
ware or dishes, Mr. Corbiey
pointed to the iact that sterilis-
ing them at 190-200 degrees F.
would rule out such a possibility.

When the customary six-week
“watch” oi the State and County
Health Board is over, it is ex-
pected as a result of negative
test data so iar, that Food Ser-
vice will be cleared oi all blame.

Marijuana Lecture Sun.

Considers Legal Pot

by Jill Pasnilr

“A drug is something that
eiiects the structure and func-
tion at the human organism."

" Marijuana is one oithe oldest
drugs used in the world," said
Dr. Helen H. Nowles, director oi
the National Association oi Stu-
dent Personnel Administrators
Drug Education Project for 1968-
67, at Phi Delta's Sorority's
lecture "Why Are Drugs illegal"
held Sunday night.

Dr. Henry Brill, director oi
Pilgrim state Hospital on Long
island and present Vice Chair-
man oi the New YorkState Addic-
tion Commission, stated that
drugs "have existed in the Far‘
East and Middle East ior thou-
sands oi years."

He continued that the drug
marijuana appeared in the United
States late in the 1920s. First
records oi its appearance here
come from New Orleans and in-
dicate that it came irom Mexico
and the Carribean.

Considerable concern was
aroused when young children
were found us the drugs. Ex-
aggerated newspaper stories re-
sulted in the passage oi laws
governing marijuana. These laws
were evidently passed without
much research into the problem.

Dr. Brill believes that " there

89 Fresh Women
MoveTo StateQua

by Eli sobeth Hellman

Chivalry revived at the Uni-
versity on the night oi October
16 when yonng "knights" helped
89 irosh women in distress c'arry
trunks and suitcas e as Whitman
Hall residents fin ly moved into
their new dorm on State Quad.

The iive dorms already estab-
lished on State Quad welcomed
the girls by sponsoring amixer.
Held on the Anthony-Whitman cor-
ner oi State Quad, the mixer
leatured the Exclusives, an Al-
bany band.

After nearly a month oi wait-
ing, the girls have mixed re-
actions to being on the
campus. When asked ii they like
it here, the typical reaction is,
“Like what - the dirt?" Many
girls ieel that Alden Hall, where
they had been staying, was
“homier.” So iar they have found
living in suites socially restric-
tive, and miss the constant'ibopv
ping downthehall" toseeiriends.

'i‘he Whitman girls now have to
get used to various incon-
veniences that the veteran State
residents have (almost) come to
take for granted - incomplete
lobbies and lounges, long walks
to breakiaet, and dirt.

Many girls areedjustingquickn
ly to their new home, though.
They enjoy. being able to go back
to the deem to rest in between
classes, they also find their new
dorm quieter for study. Many
think that the loud tastes better
at the campus center.

is no such thing as a harmless
drug. There are diiierent degrees
oi harm. A physician is reluctant
to use a drug that has not been
thoroughly explored."

He brought up the point that
LSD was considered harmless
and there was a move in 1950
to make it ireely available. At
that time not as much was known
about the drug.

Dr. Nowles dealt more with the
social aspects oi the drug mari-
juana. its potency varies accord-
ing to its use and the amount oi
time it is stored.

its eiiects also "vary accord-
ing to its potency and pattern of
use." The result iluctuates with
the general psychological state
oi the person using it, and with
his state at the moment that he
does use it.

"What this all adds up to is
that drugs are not magic potions
that do something predictable to
all individuals. We have adopted
this magical potion point oi view
and have ignored completely the

individual."

Nowles also stated that “the
marijuana laws are harsh and
unjust. However, lcannot there-
iore say that we should legalize
marijuana and make it as avail-
able as cigarettes. We just don't
know enough."

Dr. Brill explained that the
drug had not been researched
before this time because “the
establishment has somehow seen
to keep it away irom research."
Yet, Dr. Brill iurther explained
that it would be a mistake to
underestimate its eiiects.

Excessive and intensive use
or the drug, it was iound, "leads
to chronic vagahondage" and e.
decrease in the ability to produce.

Dr. Brill summarised the issue
by saying, "one cannot give this
drug a clean bill at health. it
this is given to society it is sure
‘to fall into abuse. it is up to the
society to decide whether or not
it should be legal but the choice
must be made with facts."

Union Gripe Causes

Construction Halt
by Vic Looper

The work stoppage on the
academic podium which lasted
irom Monday, October 9 until
Wednesday, October lawascaus-
ed by a disagreement between
the Electrician Union and General
Electric Laboratories (GEL).

G.E.L. has been working on a
language lab installation in the
Humanities Building since the
middle oi September.

The University's original con-
tract with G.E.L. stated that they
neither had to hire area elec-
tricians nor union electricians,
but in order to avoid uniair labor
competition they must pay the
same wage that area electricians
receive.

At that time the union did not
have any contract agreement with
the University becauso that build-
ing is not under construction and
is oiiicially owned by the Uni-
versity. The union objected to
this agreement and threatened to
walk oil the job if G.E. L. was
allowed to hire non-union men to
work on the lab.

The opening of the Fine Arts
Building was set ior October 5.
The union electricians threaten-
ed work stoppage to prevent the
opening, therefore the University
laid oii G.E.L. men to appease
the union. Aiter the building was
opened G.E.l.. was called back
to iith the job.

The union again objected and
put up an "informational picket
line" around university en-
trances. They stated that they
were neither on strike nor en-
gaged in a secondary boycott;
they were just not working, and
the other unions did not have to
abide by their picket line.
