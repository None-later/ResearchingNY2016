VIS TA Experiences;

by Carl Llndamon

This past summer 1 was as-
signed, as part of my advanced
Peace Corps training. to a Job
Corps Conservation Center lo-
cated in Townsend, Tennessee
" ‘ Mame “:“3‘3';
tag which a an
orientation at the University of
Oklahoma lasted ior nine months.

A Job Corps ConservationCen-
ter is built around the principle
of attaining employment for youth
between the ages of lo and 21.
The Corpsman, those youth who
volunteer to enter the JobCorps,
live on the center and receive
education! and vocational train-
ing on the center.

As a VISTA Associate llearn-
ed oi the many misconceptions
people have about VISTA serv-
ice and the povertyprogram in
general. The first misconception
involves the “idea of helpiu."
Sure i went in with the idea of
mum but i believe that the
“8000! - soodr" will not find
VISTA rewarding. There’s aper-
sonal interest oi traveling and
understanding how another type
oi culture live.

By another type oi culture!
mean not Just a visit or staying
a week but living day by by
with these people so that you

ent values they stress and you
don't. One of the greatest

a different type oi environment
and thought.

But to see these values alone
is not enough. You must tinder-

response to your actions. it is
analogous to memorizing one set
of figures in one uiar
mathematical problem. Bu
then when you come to a differ-
ent mathematical problem with
different ~iigures you find you
cannot do it. You must know the
principles, why they exist and
then apply it to a completely
different set oi circumstances.

While working at the JobCorps
Center my activities centered
around three main areas. First,
as an Assith Residence Work-
er. This involved the stpervision
oi 50 Corpsman in the Dormitor-
ies for an eight hour shift. Be-
tween horseplsylng and countless
problems itproved tobeahectic,
but an enioyable, eight hours.

I also substituted fortwoweeks
at the end oi my training aean
instructor in the morning hours,
while doing residence work at
night. instruction was centered
in elementary mathematics and
reading.

A third function was recrea.
tion and "unofficial counseling."
This overlapped into the two
above mentions often. "Unoffic-
ial counseling" involved the mil.
lions of conversations lhad with
Corpsman ranging Virom prob-
lems in pro-martial sex relations

i believe the greatest reward
I received was the ability to re.

such a totally different life the

to 250,000 Americans had ioined
the March route.

March On The Pants on

The first lines reac ed the
north parking lot at about 1:15
p.m. A rally was set up at the
northeast corner oi the lot away
from the building by the National
Mobilization, sponsors oi the
March, but most marchers moved
along to the line oi metal fence
that blocked the west edge of
the lot, the side facing the build-
ing. A line of troops with guns

stretched across the south end

of the lot.

By 1:30 p.m., according to
Richard Bamberger, a SUNYA
student who arrived with the first
oi the Marchers, the fence was
trampled and breached. Thou-
sands poured through the gaps, up
an incline and onto the thousand-
foot lawn that ends at the very
edge of the building.

Troops with bayonets fixed
waited at the foot of the two
ramps that lead to the top of the
podium, on which that side of
the vast building rests. Bam-
berger was with the demonstrat-
ors who approached the east
ramp. JonathanLanger,aSUNYA
freshman was with the contingent
to the west.

By now it was about 2:00 p.m.
At 2:15p.m.,twoseparate actions
commenced onthe lawn at either
end at the crowd.

On the east by the parking lot,
about 250-300 marchers, mostly
members of YAWF (Youth
Against War a. Fascism), and
the Puerto Rico Independence
Movement approached the left
ramp after surging through-para-

The troopers repelled rather
than arrested this group and fell

advanced on the 300 unruly dem-
onstrators. Fighting broke out
several times withsome arrests.

Mass arrests did not begin until
about 4:00 p.m., at whichtime
the YAWF group reformed, and
began to move towards the
M.P.'s. Bayonets were fixed.
When several oi the YAWF’s
were wounded by bayonets in the
hands oi Marine M.P.s, what was
left oi the 300 surged forward
right over them and up the left

ramp' Quakers Beaten

0n the west, marines were

massed three deep at about 2:30
p. m. with fixed bayonets. At
3:00 p.m. six Quaker families
attempted to peacefully cross the
troop lines there. Paratroopers
let them through. 0.5. Marshalls
and Marine M.P.s set upon them
at that point, however, violently
beating men, women and children
and dragging all off to vans.
Langer, a witness to this stated
that they did not resist, yet were
beaten with clubs, boots and rifle
butts.
The Marshall: were mostly re-
sponsable for the violent beat-
ings received by hundreds of
Marchers, usually without pro-
vocation. This was in direct
opposition to most of the para-
troopers, many oi them draftees,
who often attempted to remove
demonstrators with little physi-
cal violence.

Until about 4:00 p. m. , the group
on the west was quite. Flowers
were thrown at the MP. lines.
At four, as the YAWF group from
New York was storming the east
ramp, the group to the west was
standing quietly,

Tear gas was used to halt the
east ramp stormers. As they
withdrew tear gas was shot gen-
erally into the crowd on the east,
which now numbered many thou-
sands and oi which all but the
few at front were standing peace-
fully. Bamborger, among that
group, was teargassed.

Teargas was then fired at the
vast group by the west ramp also.
Ann_ Arbor YAWF's were then
rushed by Marines in gas masks.
Longer, among others, was
beaten in the crowd. They fought
back and repulsed the M.P.'s
who retreated rapidly up the
ramp. The teargas on the east
ramp soon dissipated and it was
again stormed by the New York
YAWF's and Puerto Rico inde-
pendence people. They reached
the top of this ramp followed by
thousands oi members of the
crowd. .

The two groups oispproximate-
ly 600 people who took part in the
tow incidents stormed tOgether
up the steps, across the court
yard and to the very doors of
the Pentagon. Some were able
to get in for several minutes.
Marine enforcements at this point
drove the demonstrators back.
A line was formed 70 feet in
front of the stairs at about 4:30
P.m. This line was maintained
with little change until the last

‘demonstrators were arrested,

Sunday night.

These two incidents on the
ramps were the only evidence-oi
violence on the oithedemon-
strators. At the gr test extent,
about 000 of the 36,000 to 37,000
demonstrators gathered at the



They r

Pentagon from Saturday to Mon-
day took- part. That the inci-
dents were over-played by
a biased and blood thirsty press
obvious to any oi the thousands

who witnessed it. u

Troopers Told To Shoot

According to one paratrooper
on the lines, wholspoke to, allthe
troops carried loaded rifles and
were ordered to shoot if charged
by demonstrators: That not a shot
was fired isproofofthe generally
passive mood d the crowd. The
aims oi all but a small majority
of the demonstrators at the Penta-
gon were passive resistance at
all costs. Most of the violently
inclined were restrained by the
demonstrators themselves from
any violent actions against the
troops.

Demonstrators Dig In

By 5'p.m., the whole demon-
stration had settled down. About
three thousand people were
sitting in on top of the podium
stamps.

The sit-in people set peaceful-
ly at the top in an area about
seventy feet wide and four hun-
dred feet long. To their left
was another contingent of sit-ins
who were in the area above the
ramps. They were cut off from
the stairway people byalow wall.
Many had reached their positions
by scaling ropes thrown down by
the first people to reach the top.

As dusk fell, large bonfires
were started at ahalf dozen spots
on the lawn. More appeared on
the ramps and among the sit-ins.
The twenty foot podium walls
were soon covered with peace
slogans. Army searchlights oc-
casionally illuminated the build-
ing and the demonstrators. The
scene was more oi what one would
expect to have seen before the
Bastille in 1789, than before the
Pentagon in 196'].

The paratrooper M. P.s manned
the lines before the steps. They
we'l'e armed with rifles and billy-
sticks. U.S. Marshalls moved
just behind the first line.

Ordinance was rapidly or-.

ganized by the sit-ins. Bull-
horns announcing changes in the
military situation and anything
else of interest was operating
from 5:00 p.m. on. Food and
water was soon distributed.

Morale was very high and it
appeared that we would be able
to stay all night. There was
singing, conversation, and much
talking to the troops,telling them
why we were here, and why we
were against the war. The troops
were not per mitted to answer, but
by their expressions, only a
minority remained actively
hostile. Several were removed
from the lines, probably for look-
ing too friendly.

‘Troops Brutality

About 8:00 p.m., new troops
appeared on the lines, obviously
under new orders. Theybeganto
inch up on the people sitting
quietly there. They kicked and
poked the people directly before
them.

About every ten minutes, they
would pull one from the line,
beat him and hand him to the
Marshalls. The Marshalls beat
a number of people very badly
on the way to the paddy wagons.
I witnessed all these arrests and
beatings from a point thatshrank
from seventy to about fifteen feet
from the M..T. line, as the lint

An Open Lotion
To University " '

by Richard Evans

Like almost everything in the
modern world, the march on
Washington last weekend _was
ambiguous: an event which point-
ed simultaneousiy to the poten-
tial for good and the

' ior evil which lies beneath the

placid surface of our society.

Part of what reopened was
terrifying. At those times we
and the soldiers feared and hat-
ed each other; violence erupted
between us; and many of us were
beaten, kicked, or gassed.

Much of the demonstration,
however, was a genuinely beauti-
ful encounter between human be-
ings, and represented a triumph
of nonviolence and love over the
dehumanizing effects ofhatred
and enmity.

On Sunday night, for example;
hundreds oi us awaited our ar-
rests peacefully and sang "Sol.
diers Are Our Brothers" to the
tune of "We Shall overcome"
while MP’s stood nervously in
front of us and some of them
were obviously fighting tears.

i think i can best communi-
cate my understanding of what
happened by recalling step by
step, the activity 1 was involv-

n.

On Saturday at l p.m. the
Albany demonstrators arriv-
ed at the Lincoln Memorial to
Join the tens of thousands of peo-
ple who were waiting to march
for peace.

We stood and sat around for
hours while our “leaders” tried
to organize us well enough to
start the procession.

Almost everyone wore a dia-
mond shaped card saying "We
don't want violence."

The next stage of the demon-
stration was supposed to in.
volve nonviolent civil disobed-
ience and peaceful submission
to arrest. The plan was for
those who wished to commitcivil
disobedience to cross a clearly
marked line beyond which all
demonstrating would be illegal.

i found when larrived at the
Pentagon at 8:30 that a large
crowd had gathered on the steps
and settled down for a sit-in
vigil. Everyone was tense and
no one seemed to know whether
it was legal to be there or not.

If the government had announc.
ed that the sit-in was illegal, I
am sure that we would have sub-
mitted nonviolently to arrest.
Indeed, many of us proved our
willingness to do so on the fol.
lowing night.

On Saturday, however, we
were offered no such option.
instead, we faced a solid line
of MP's who were backed up by
federal marshals. Every ten min-
utes or so, one or the marshals
would come forward to either
push an MP into kicking a dem-
onstrator or to crack his own
billy club over the skull of a
sit-inner.

We soon saw that the purpose
of these tactics was to let the
MP's move slowly forward un»
til they had reocoupied the area.
Little by little they formed a
wedge which could drive into our
crowd and disperse us.

Tension mounted for a long
time as the beatings became
more and more frequent. Those
of us who were sitting-in lock-
ed arms and presented a show
of nonviolent solidarity.

All of us began to sing peace
songs.

Before the tension haduchance
to really disappear, however,the
MP's began to move forward
in unison, Molding their rifle
butts like clubs and splitlng the
heads of several demonstrators
of both sexes.

Because all of us bad link.
ad arms, it proved very difficult
to getaway. Somo people manag-
ed to break and run, others tried

us simply went limp. l was kick.
