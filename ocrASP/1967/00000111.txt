Peace Mobilization

We realize that many may raise the
objection that this issue is overly con-
cerned with comment on the Peace Mo-
bilization, but as Vietnam is one of the
most vital conflicts now confronting the
'Great American Mind' we feel that there
can not be too much serious considera-
tion on 'its implication's'or its relative
successes or failures. 1 .

The implications of Saturday's march
are frightening; a great mood of disil-
lusionment with the whole thing has
set in for many, including us. However
our disillusionment, and our fear, rests
mainly with the governmental reactions
to the whole movement.

The total withholding of governmental
response is simply an outrage, (mean-

while the President states that the dem- ,

onstration, of course, will not influence
policy, and McNamara still reports to
work at 8 a.m.). The active government
recognition of thewhole movement con-
sisted oi the MP9 chartered for the oc-
casion. Why the MPs and nocomment, or
no effort to establish any equilibrium
which may have made the MPs unneces-
sary?

We find it frightening tosee the gov-
ernment ignore so completely the moral
commitment not only of 35,000 active
demonstrators, but of the other 165,-
000 non-violent marchers. Certainly we
did not expect, nor call for, the govern-
ment to allow the marchers to storm
the building en masse, but why this per-
sistent blockbeadedness?

For example it seems some of this
could have been avoided if McNamara
ind offered to allow a small delegation
of demonstrators influential in organiz-
ing the mobilization to enter the Pen-.
tagon and present a petition. With any
show of concern by the government
perhaps the civilly disobedient would

have reconsidered their actions.
it seems the country has reached

a sad state when the government refuses
to hear the voice of such a large body
of peopngt was because oi this long
continuing silence that this demonstra-
tion was conceived, and it was in view
of this silence that we felt civil disobed-
ience was warranted. ,

But there was tear gas, and clubs,
and the whole scene. The violence has
incurred public disgust. and the media
label most of the protectors as being
"hippies." in view of all this has any-
thi been ined?

We feel Ithe peaceful arrests of the
few hundred marchers who chose towait

it out at the Pentagon alone makes the
demonstration worthwhile. At least it
may prove to skeptics the dedication of
these people; it also may force the gov-
ernment to think about the whole non-
violent scene, and realize that we may
have reached an end of the line in peace-
ful demonstrations. Dedicated people
have lost faith in the peaceful system,
and are advocating out and out violence.
If the government does not make at
least a half-hearted attempt to work
with these people violence will erupt.

Council Goes To Pot

in view of our editorial position in
favor of the legalization of marijuana
we are disappointed in the bill passed
by Central Council last week. Besides
being poorly written and illustrating
a definite need for some to research
the topics of LSD and marijuana, the
bill was very weak.

Central Council really took a nothing
stand. The members and onlookers got
bogged down in picayune wording and
ended up watering down an already
watered-down statement.

Even the support of an investiga-
tion resulted in a hassle. When the
second part was first presented with
the Council standing in opposition to
the severity of present penalties. op-
position became vehement. it was ac-
cepted only after the Council took the
position of "questioning" the sever-
ity of the penalties.

Information about marijuana and LSD
and STP might helpsome membersbe
more sure .of themselves but there will
surely be an even bigger argument when
a more definite stand is presented for
a vote. Someone even brought up the
question of why the Council should even
concern itself with such matters.

The answer was that when the govern-
ment was reorganized three years ago,
much technical business was supposedly
moved into the commissions and lesser
organizations in the hope that Council
could take a stand on issues of impor-
tance to the student body. This issue is
important and it's time to take a stand.

We know where we stam but the Coun-
cil evidently isn't assure yet. After
this investigation which is being hear-
tily ‘endorsed by all let's see a bold
statement by our “liberal” governing
body. Avoidance of the issue or nebu-
lous wording won't make this problem
disappear or diminish in importance.

brutality. Thetwo,paratrocpers,

and riﬂes and walked over to join
the demonstrators. The action
took place so dickly that they
made it to the eafty of the crowd,

among thousands. An announce-
ment was made to the people on
the stairs by bullhorn. Cheer-‘
ing and chants of "Join us, join
us" quickly spread among the
whole of the tens of thousands
left both around the Psntagonand
on the parking lot.

About 9:45, a thrld M.P. at-
tempted to desert to the peace
demonstrators, but was stopped
and led off under guard. About
11:00-11:30, a thrid successful
desertlon took place. l per-
sonally witnessed these last two
incidsnts, although they were
denied officially to the press by
Pentagon officials.

As the night were on, tension
began to increase amongthe mili-
tary, as the sit-ins remained
strong, unmoved, and with very
high morale. Arrests of
marchers and brutal measures
became worse. The wedge of
troops in the middle of the lines
drove deeper into the crowd.

More soldiers were moved
from the lines for wavering in
the face of brutal and unjustified
orders. At no point did the mili-
tary make any announcement of
intentions to the sit-ins, although
slt-ln leaders requested state-
ments time and time again.

A, program of singing, appeals
to the troops, and information
was continued without break by
sit-in leaders, mostly from SDS
and the New York Draft Re-
sistance, a New York City group

Strong Again

Attention Mr. Strong.

Attending a lecture at SUNY
last night i picked up a copy of
the ASP -- in which lwas very
interested to read of your forth-
coming “ExperimentalSeminar”
and Free University concept.

if it's possible, both my bus-
band (a Biology prof at Union
College) and myself(a philosophy
instructor at Albany Junior Col-
lege) would be interested to attend
some of these seminars. All
three taplcs that were listed are
particularly interesting to us.

Having tried something similar
myself, l wonder if you are going

to try to encourage, even within a
"Seminar" situation, expression
of onsls ideas through “com-
munication media" other than
words, i.e. dance (not contrived
or forced, but usable if it’s
actually more congenial to the
participants way of expressing
himself), sketching, etc.

At any rate, i wish you much
success in this endeavor and
would surely appreciate any in-
formation concerning it.

i look forward to hearing from

ally. However, after attending
last weekend's peace march in
Washington, even if oniyasan ob-
esrvor, i don’t feel tint any stand
1 could take would be that of the
detached bystander. Although my
opinions luvs not been altered, i
feel much more justified in stat-
ing them.

Arriving in Washington early
Saturthy morning, i viewed the
area from the top of the Wash-
ington Monument. The Lincoln
Memorial was overﬂowing with
people. The magnitude of the
crowd was overwhelming. From
my vantage point, lcould not make
out the details of the crowd, 1‘
could only judge the number of
people who were present. When
the speeches began, i moved
closer in order to hear the views
of the leaders of this assemblage.
At this point, i could see tint
the crowd was composed of war
Veterans, clergy, businessmen,
but, in the majority were “hip-
pies.” The speeches were radi-
cal and rabble-rousing. As the
crowd became more eager to get
the march under way, i moved to
a point which would overlook
the entire march as it passed.

When the people began to file
past me, i was awed by their
numbers. They went by, 35
abreast, for two and shelf hours.
Up until that point, i was sympa-
thetic with the cause, and believ-
ed that these marchers would be
able to meet the situation with
orderliness, sincerity, and or-
ganization. Up until then, this
had been the case.

When the marchers reached
the Pentagon,allhsll broke loose.
No one seemed to be really sure

I '. of what they were trying to ac-

complish at the Pentagon. it
seemed that no one had toldthsm
how to conduct themselves while
they were at the Pentagon. First,
there was a short incident be-
tween the members and thecoun-
tar marchers. Then, the march-
ere seemed to become kamikaze
pilots, flying into the resistance
line only to be beaten to the
ground. Some of those who lad
to be carried into ambulances
sustained serious injuries. Time
after time lwatched as a demon-
strator lunged at tho militarypo-
lice, only to be beaten back.
This unswlainsble violence
seemed to be more of what is to

  

    

be expected in a war sons rather
than at a peace march. Eventin-
ly, the marchers settled down on
the steps and began their long
vigil. When ileft, at 11:00 p.m.,
the Pentagon was illuminated by
searchligitts; marchers were
huddled around bonfires (which
were being fed with their draft
cards; the entire scene was simi-
lar to a completely tall-cal night-
mare.

Later tint night, as lhsard
the radio reports describing the
march, i realized how little this
massive struggle lad accom-
plished. if, as those marchers
i talked to had told me, the
march had been successhll, why
had radio stations played down
the march's most violent as-
pects? Why 1nd more air time
been devoted to the counter pro-
test march in New York which
was only one tenth as large as
Washington's? Why had Presi.
dent Johnson not publicly
acknowledged the presence of
the demonstrators who were only
blocks away from the white
House? The only conclusion at
which i could arrive was that
the march had been deemed as
an insignificant achievement.

What actually was proven by
the march? One thing that was
proven was tlatt there is no lack
of participation when the issue
of withdrawing from Viet Nam
is involved. it was also proven
that a huge crowd of demonstrat~
ors is incapable of keeping it-
self within the law during such
a mass gathering. it has also
proven the irresponsibility of
the type of individuals who take
part in such a demonstration.

What i believe to be the most
mr reaching aspect ofthis march
is the reflection upon the legiti-
mate objector to the war. lfac-
iions like these continue to oc-
cur, anyone who doss not believe
in this country's objectives in
the war will be branded by the
resentment which will follow such
assininc exhibitions as last
weekend's. When the basic
concept of a peaceful demon-
stration has been lost, when vio-
lence is used to obtain peace,
when the President of the Unit-
ed States can sit and ignore a
peace rally which is taking place
in front of his door, then i do
not see how this rally can be
deemed successful. 1 person-
ally believe that last weekend's
march lals fallen so far short of
its intended goal, tint it has be-
come detrimental to the cause
which it was intended to pro-
mote.

CHAPTER TWO: lN WHICH
WE FIND THAT "SUNY"
DOES NOT SPELL “THE BE
ALL AND END ALL"

I used to think that the term
provincial meant that you lived
in Gansevoort, New York (popu-
latton ? cows, 16 humans). Butl
have since found that it can be
applied equally well to students
here at State.

i went home last week just to
see if things were getting along
in my absence (they were) andas
soon as i got on tho Thruway l
was amazed to find that there is
indeed a world outside the boun-
daries of the perimeter road
which is for all accounts and
purposes “the border of our
lives" here at state. i meanl
had heard rumors to the effect

there was something else
out there but i never sctually
believed them. Well, maybe it
was the brilliantly colored fall
leaves that shocked me back into
an awareness of reality (living
in these solid cement dorms and
walking around on that solid
fitment podium i am never really
“tallest of the comings in and

. will" out offall) or perhaps it

was the sight of all of those nice
blue and white (or Is it green
and white?) exit signs bearingthe
names of all of those exotic
sounding places like Catskill Re-
gion, Hudson, Kingston and New
Paltz that told me that the rest
of the world was still there
awaiting the traveler and adven-
turer bold enough to sample her
delights.

it's fine for the Administration
to call this school a"Community
of Scholars" but isn't it kind of
dangerous when we do in fact
start thinking of ourselves as a
community and start forgetting
that there is, a world of living,
loving, working and multiplying
people out there in the great
void beyond the Dutch, Colonial
and state Quads?

er University etudents and we
bund refuge in a hippie com-
mune for the night. We 'he'ard
on Sunday that a mass rally at
the Lincoln Memorial had decided
to join them for another sit'in,
this one at the bottom of~ the
steps. Permission had been
secured to remain there until,
midnight.

-.it was this final demonstra-
tion which impressed me as the
most beautiful part of the week-
end. There was a kind of soli-
darity among the demonstrators
which consisted paradoxically
with a strong sense of individ-
uality and diversity among us.

There was free discussion all
afternoon of the pros and cons
of remaining after midnight tobe
arrested. The only consensus
reached wastlnt eachofus should
make up his own mind and "do
his own thing."

We also wantedtocommunicate
with the MP's and convince them
that violence would be unneces-
sary when midnight came.

We attempted, in speeches
made by anyone who asked for
the microphone, to tell them why
we were there and why we're in
“The movement.”

We talked about the injustice
and brutality of war, about the
suffering of the Vietnamese peo-
ple, and about our own treatment
the night before.

The guard clunged every sixty
minutes. in every case, the hos.
tility in their expressions would
disappear before the next clunge
of guard and some of them seem.
ed to be crying when they left.

When it was almost twelve,
we maintained a moment of sl-
lcncs in which each of us could
pray to his God for peace.

Finally we began to sing softn
ly and were quietly arrested.

Outraged
To the Editor:

A transition has been made.
Beyond all doubt the ASP should
now be considered to be a liber-
ally slanted newspaper. October
fifth's edition, which was not un-
like the provious one, contained
at least eleven contributions that
may easily be labeled as oriented
to the left, while there were none
to the right. Of these eleven, two
were noted as editorials. The
others were liberal articles, lib-
eral columns, a liberal feature,
and two liberal ads. We are being
called by our paper to support
pot, fight against the war, get
power, and just plainly and simply
be more lefty. Students should,
of course, "acquaint themselves
with joint power and then start
campaigning for what they want."
What they want, however, is not
necessarily what the ASP wants
and what it wants the students
to want.

It is unfortunate that this
school, diverse and wonderful as
it is, offers so little obvious
opposition to anything our more
liberal friends want to pass off.
in one of its labeled editorials,
the ASP did help to increase the
awareness of how liberal BUNYA
really is, just before calling for
more of the same. it also may
have closedthe credibility gspfor
some who didn't believe that
drugs really are usedoncampus.
(These include several others be-
sides pot, for those of you who
don't walk on the grass). When
the average student bears an
ASP echo of a resolution com-
ing from the National Student“-
socistion, he should wince a bit
and think twice, since an coca-
sional beam (1 light which is di-
rected at that nondescript sound-
ing organization called NBA very
often comes back with more than
a faintly pink hue.

Council Datodles

_To the Editor

Well, it seems Central Council
is at it again. Last Thursday's
meeting wo' amazing in the fact
that so much was discussed about
what was not being considered.
The matter under consideration
was i) that the Central Council
support investigations into the
problem of drugs, and 2) that
they question the severity of the
marijuana laws. Now, before you
lose your temper, let me say that
this is not what l'm complaining
about; in fact, 1 voted for the
motions. What concerns meabout
Council is the fact that the dis-
cussion centered on thedefinition
of hallucinogenic drugs, as It was
expressed in the bill, and the
inclusion of marijuana under this
term. .What the discussionshouki
have been on was whether or not
the Central Council should pass
this bill. Central Council has no
power (or reason, really) to de-
fine what specificallyahallucino-
genic drug is; this has already
been done by the government.
The fact is that these drugs
should be investigated, and Cen-
tral Council did seem to agree
on this since the bill was pass-
ed, although due to a parliap
mentary oversight it nearly didn't
go into effect.

The waste of time in unneces-
sary discussion is almost un-
believable. Tho second part of
the bill (to question the severity
of the laws concerning marijuana)
was obviosuly favored since a
good deal of time was spentques-
tioning the severity of the marl-
juana laws.

This wasting of time is one of
the most serious problems the
officers of the Council have to
face. No wonder members get
bored and the Councu's image
suffers. Let's hope that some-
thing can be done about this. A
little more parliamentary order
(such as keeping to the subject
and-or finishing the business at
band) would help considerably.

At that point, the 800 or so peo-

left, according to Greg Kiersr,
an Albany student arrested at
that time. All the rest were
carried off, now without vio-

center.

About '15 of the 250 people at
