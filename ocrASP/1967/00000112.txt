' is 'an interesting reminder of a period of ter- .

are of tremendous importance in the modern

theatre. By utilizing the “epic theatre" tech-’

niques of Plscator and Brecht, the production
should be of great educational value to those

According to Leonard, Brecht, in this drama,
attacked tint segment of the German populap
tion who, in the 1930s, preferred peace and
anonymity to opposing the totalitarian infringe-
ments on their freedoms tint chily increased

, in number.‘

in this play, Brecht housed on a point, but
never stated tilt point. However, Brecbt's im-
plication is quite strong: tint excessive abuses
by the state of its legitimate powers were toler-
ated for too long until such abuses became
common and sec bie.

Brecht intended only to denwnstrate vari-
ous social attitudes and actions so tilt the and-
ience could fudge them for themselves. Each
act is presented for judgment entirely inde-
pendent of the Mahala" of the character
performing tilt act. '

Brecht never even considered the psycholog-
ical or eocioaoonomicel reasons tint might
impel bis characters to act in the way they do.
He simply presents these social acts and their
resultant effects without emuses or Justifica-
tions of any kind.

Thus, the drama is tempered with a sense

- both of realism end e'spreseionism; tint is,

sterooat ' characters, move in a realistic
m.“ pl". M is best described as
e semi-documentary, concerned with the'rise,
of Nazism in the historical period from 1933
to the Austrian plebiscite of 1938. .

Sixteen episodes make, in the play, each
a self-contained, one-act drama. There is, no
inrrative. only thematic, continuity between
these scenes. Twenty performers will assume
the enormous number of roles.

The-actors will wear basic costumes; at
the begiming of the production, they will enter
on stage wearing masks that will suggest an
atmosphere of superficial complacency and
security end mass uniformity, disguising the
powerful presence of autocratic fear.

actors Mil change into simple cos-
tume edornments from costume pegs at a
side of.the stage. Also on stage will bethe
props table from which the actors will gath-
er their props before each scene.

in addition, the lighting board will be in
full view of the audience, with a tape re-
corder-playing German and Nani songs, and
two screens on which slides of contempo-
rary magasine and newmeper clippings end
photographs, documentary film snippings, and
the Nazi swastika, itself, will be displayed.

Hanging above the “platform for demonstra-
don” will be a huge collage-mobile, an "icon,"
combining the German eagle, Prussian sym-
bol of supreme authority, the swastika, living
symbol of Nazi totalitarianism, and e Panzer

nk, dominant symbol of German Nazi po-
litical power.

Sets have been designed by,Mr. Robert
Domer, with lighting coordimted by Mr. Jer-
ome Henley. Costumes and make-up will be
designed by Miss Arlene DuMond. Graphics
have been the creation of Mr. Theodore Glaser.

in one scene of Claude Le-
louch's “A Man and a Woman"
(Madison Theatre), the man tells
an anecdote about the sculptor
Giaccmetti, a cat, and a Hem-
brandt painting; in case we don't
get it, the man explains, “Be-
tween Art and Life, I choose
Life." Not a bad point except
that it is the only point ofvalue
in an otherwise uninteresting

film.

It is hard to summarize the
plot, so thin and vacuous is the
dramatic interest. The Man
(Jean-Louis Trintignant) is a
widower with a you son; the
Woman (Anouk Aimee isawidow
with a young daughter. The Man
has more or less forgotten his
wife; what drama there is in the
film arises from the Woman's

A. inability to forget her husband-—

an oafish stuntman whom, we are
told, "went wild over peeple,
ideas, countries," but whom we
see in ﬂashbacks merely smok-
ing cheroots and mindlessly
crowning bossa novas.

Naturally the Man and the W0-
men meet and become fond of one
another. When the Man places in
the Monte Carlo race, the Woman
sends him a cable: “1 love you."
He rushes back to her, they go
to bed (in one of the most tedious
bedroom scones ever put on film),
but her dead husband's memory
interposes; in a line memorable
for its crushing banality, "He's
not dead for me yet." But she
suddenly, capriciously, changes
her mind and the film closes on
passionate embrace.

The Man and the Woman are
Jet Set people. He races cars,
reads Time, eats Finnish salmon,
drives a Mustang, and goes boat-
ing. She is a script girl, lives in
Montmarte, and might have step-
ped out of Vogue. But we are
never told any more about them
than this; it never occurs to
Lelouch that we might be more
interested in them as characters
than consumers.

Lelouch camouflages the
essential emptiness of the drama
with tedious, irrelevant byplay.
How does he tell us the Man is
a racer? Why, he shows him get-
ting into a car and racing around
and around the track; afterawhile
he stops the car. End of scene.
Even worse are those intermin-
able shots of the Man driving in
the rain.

Or take the rostaurant scene
with the Man, the Woman, and the
Kids: in nine minutes (a lot of
time, on the screen) Lelouch
minus!) to tell us that the little
boy wants to be a fireman and
doesn't like shrimp, that movies
are good. and that is and 1'1
are unlucky numbers in racing.
it seems impossible that a di-
rector could show people can-
versing for one-tenth of his film
Without even accidentally reveal-

' “ll something significant, but

Lelouch manages to do it.
Lelouoh has swiped his style

from the New Wave and tele-
vision commercials, but here
it is empty technique, never illu-
minating theme or meaning. (he
was the cameraman as well as
the director and apparently
just couldn't restrain himself.)

The film is notatotal disaster.
There are traces of humor, most-
ly unintentional (like that boopy-
doop soundtrack), some in-
dividual shots are impressive,
and the color is stunning. But
ask what the movie tells us about
human life and you realize that
it is, for all the arty preten-
sions, a Hollywood film through
and through.

There may be hope in sight for the deteriorat-
ing Broadway theater district in New York. We
theater goers are well aware of the problem
which is so prevalent at the present time. Since
1942, Broadway has lost thirteen theaters, and
is destined to lose more as the land'sites on
which these theaters, whose financial situation
may be quite dubious, are sold, destroyed and
cleared for new office building . '

The prospects are not too bright. The Urie
_Bulldings Corporation is planning on replacing
Loew's Capitol with an office building, and the
City investing Company is seriously consideng
selling the sites on which the Moroscoendilelen
Hayes theaters are located. This would bedcing
away with three more theaters. ,

The plans devised by Dalaid Elliott, chairman
of the City Planning Commission and supported
by Mayor Lindsay would provide not for the
salvaging of the old theaters, but the construc-
tion of new ones. A company planning to con-
struct a new office building in this area would
be allowed by the Commission to build extra
rentable floor space if it included a theater in
the structure. This would be to the advantage of
the builder because he could erect a taller
building in areas where they are forbidden by the
zonlng laws, thus providing more income from
ren .

Such is the case with the site of the old
Astor Hotel which can, according to zoning
laws, only be replaced with e 47 story building.
If a theater were to be included inthis struc-
ture, they would be granted three extra floors.
The same is true for the Loew's Capitol site.

This is truly a good plan, but it has its prob-
lems. First of all, the cost of construction is a
major stumbling block. in order to build an
adequate theater, one has to plan on spending
approximately $3 million, and will these com-
panies be willing to go that far? Another prob-
lem, will they be willing to take the chance on
renting a theater, considering the fact that it is
really quite a risk? Theaters are not always in
use unless they are running a hit show; they,
therefore, stand dark a good deal of the time.
This is a loss, and will it be possible to over-
come such a situation?

Still another problem are the already existing
theaters. Many times even those that remain
are dark for long periods. Thereforeifnew ones
are created, the old ones will be forced to fold.

The Spectator

by Robert B. Cutty

The Warner Bros. 70MM
screen version of "Camelot"
opened with a "gala premiere”
celebration in New York last
night. i hope to see this techni-
color, panavision musical be-
fore the Academy nominations
are released early next year.
However, having seen "Came-
lot" on the stage several years
ago, I have my doubts as to the
quality of the movie.

Moss Hart staged theBroadway
production, his last theatrical
effort of any kind at all, for the
work involved in giving the play
life was to take his own. The
musical was adapted from the
late ’l‘.ll. White’s "The Once
and Future King" by lyrics-
writer Alan Jay Lerner, with
music by Frederick Loewe.

Lerner and Loewe were the
team that had created the music-
al masterpiece 4My Fair Lady'
from Shaw's “Pygmalion,” with
this experience behind them sug-
gested that "Camelot" would be
anything other than a smash suc-
cess.

Adapter Lerner mustbe charg-
ed with the full responsibility for
the eventual failure of "Camo-
lot." True, it was no easy task
to transform a collection of old
English myths into a modern,
romantic musical.

But, easy or not, the work was
assigned to Lerner and he came
up with a lifeless, trite drama,
loaded with laughably implausible
characters and plot situations.
"Camelot" on stage reduced the
noble Arthurian legend to a
middle-class soap opera with
songs.

But such songs. Frederick
Loowe's score is, if anything,
almost better than the one he
composed for ‘Ledy.’ Ills music
is richly romantic at various
points; the songs “lF Ever l
should Leave You," ubeforel
Gaze at You Again," “The Saint-
ly Joys of Maidenhood," “l Loy-
ed You Once in Silence," and
"How to Handle a Woman" attest
to this lovely quality.

At times Lerner and Loewe

write with a rousing, robust,
Rabelaisian streak of humor, as
in "I Wonder What the King is
Doing Tonight?," “The Lusty
Month of May," “C'est Moi,"
“What do the Simple F‘olk D07,"
and “Fie on Goodness."

The score is not perfect. One
dreadfully romantic bit of utter
triviality is "Follow Me," sung
by a nymph who places Merlin
the Magician under a spell near
the beginning of the play. This
is the weakest spot in the first
act and hopefully the song has
been cut from the movie.

Ono terrible place of supposed
cleverness is “The Seven Dead-
ly Sins," sung by Mordred in the
flimsy second act. Mordred is
,the son of Arthur by a witch
who had seduced the present
king of England when he was but
a boy. This plot situation is
ridiculous enough, but Lerner
adds to it.

Mordred is given, by Lerner,
the task of persuading the Knights

primarily because many of them are financially
:mtebie ale ittrisilPerhaps site owners ofthese

ousee w s ong y oppose enew proposition.
it is really a risk because themlytimesthat w,‘
the Broadway theater is really booming are in _. r
the fall seasons when actors, writerannenciera,
etc. rush to New York to take advantage of the]
openings. After that there are plentyottheatere.‘ .
it only remains to be observed, however, that if
this is the case, why has so much theater moved
uptown?

This will be a very interesting situation to
watch. There is no doubt that some actionneeds
to be taken because we need new intimate theaters
for experimental productions, and because the
old ones are beginning to look rather shabby. if
you doubt my word, go into the imperial or the
St. James. They are very definitely in need of
uplifting.

Broadwa is truly the capital of the theater
world,and t does seem a shame that the lack of
sufficient theater space should become a detri-
ment to its reputation. i think that the proposed
plan is a good one. Hotels, restaurants, and
night clubs are supporting this move becguse
they depend on the theater crowd coming to the
city' for business. New theaters would perhaps
stimulate and offer greater opportunities for
more playwrights and actors, and would really
put what is beginning to look like a sick Broad-
way solidly back on its two feet.

Shows are beginning to appear very rapidly
on Broadway (some have disappeared just as
rapidly), but here areafewofthepleys that have
opened, or are scheduled to open soon:

Broadway's longest running play, "Life With
Father" (10 years) is having a revival at City
Center; "The Birthday Party," a success, is
at the Booth; “How to be a Jewish Mother,”
a musical with Molly Picon is scheduled at
the Hudson on December 21; "The Happy
Times" with Robert Goulet, on December 20;
"What did we do Wrong," a comedy with
fabulous Paul Ford is now previewing at the
Helen Hayes; "Henry, Sweet Henry" with,Don
Ameche at the Palace on October 23; and “o-
Neill's More Stately Mansions" with inng
Bergman opened at the Broathn'st on October
31. If you want tickets for this show, you had
bettle hurry because Bergman leaves on Febru-
ary .

then returns to Camelot, the
seat of English government, to
rescue Guinevere. Then, war he-
gins between ‘France and Eng-
land.

All of this confused action
occurs in the second act. Though
it may appear exciting anddrama-
tic in prose rendering, it came
across quite poorly onstage. For
instance, when Mordrod breaks
in upon the illicit rendez-vous
of Lancelot and Guinevere, the
bold Frenchman holds off his
captors a la Errol Flynn.

When Lancelot rescues Guine-
vere from Camelot, a choir de-
scribes the action in thunderous,

Arthur urges Goulet on-

"The Seekers," who will
appear in concert hero on Satur-
day are essentially a folk group
who have reached success with
only a little of the "folk-rock"
influence which has so affected
the New Christy Minstrels. The
Seekers have managed to make
an album which is basically folk
and contains only enough "rock"
to improve their sound.

A good example of this is
“Georgy Girl” from the album
of the same name. More or less
a simple tune, it is done simply.
The Seekers make their own back-
ground music with their own
instruments (which is somewhat
unusual these days when so many
singers have an elaborate back,-
ground added to their vocal).

“Georgy Girl" achieved its
effect by its simplicity, the
clarity of its words (so the
“message” comes thrOugh), and

the e Seekers artistry. Their
voices in just the right combina-
tion and their musical arrange-
ments literally make the song.

One of the herd "folk" tunes

is "Louisiana Man." This has a
rhythmical melody sounding like
a Mississippi River tune, and to
probably the only “real” folk
song on the album.

V The Seekers make it with
"California Dreamint." The pre-
sentation is straight-forward and
clear, which in this case works
but which easily could have turn-
ed sour if the Seekers were less
musically talented then they are,
since the words whichlack mean-
ing are clearly understood.

"Turn, Turn, Turn,” “island
of Dream," and "Red Rubber
Ball," on the LP are also well
handled. In "Well, Well, Well"
however, the Seekers add nothing
to the song. . '
