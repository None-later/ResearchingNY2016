Decker Works Exhibit

by Gail R. Soticn

The water colors currently
on exhibit in the Campus Center
Art Gallery are by Mrs. Joyce
Decker, an artist from Cam.

dge, N.Y., who is the head
of the Art Department in the
Mechanicville School System.

The paintingsasawhole exhibit
a fine sense of form and color,
and the warmth and freedom tilt
is characteristic of water colors.
Mrs. Decker used to paint in
oils, but found that she couidbet-
ter express herself in this more
fluid medium. She uses negative
space In a way which is not feas-
ible in oils. '

Most of the paintings are done
on kochi, an imported Japanese
paper of rough texture and deck-
led edge. This roughness works
especially well in one landscape,
"Black and White." Thelinepro-
duced by the water color on the
kochi paper is fuzzy and con-
tributed to the woodsinese of
the forest scene portrayed. The
shading of the trees is especially
well done, end the raw dsckled
edges of the paper give thepaint.
ing almost the quality ofa Rob-
ert Frost poem.

“Cathedral” is Mrs. Decker's
abstract work. The colors used
in the forms of the design have
all the vibrancy of a stained
glass window, but tend to be
rather meaningless as a whole.

In “Cape cod,” the artist uses
her sense of negative spacequite
well, the color being applied
sparinsly. almost likehighlights.

“West Side" is a more power-
ful painting tien most of the oth-
ers. The artist here has used

Fourth Time
Around

by Igor Korelulr

The events of the past couple
of months have pointed out the
effort in futility in running such
events as Homecoming or any
other pop concert. Spencer Da-
vis, "The Byrds," and finally
the “Magnificent Men,” and you
wonder if it stops now or should
you wait until Sat. night to find
out who, really is going to per-
form.

For the third time this year
a pop group has cancelled oul
on a concert at this University.
First it was “The Buckinginmr”
for the Senior Weekend, then
both Spencer Davis and "The
Byrds,” for Homecoming.

The unfortunate thing is that
this is only a sampling in the
trend being tollowed by rock
groups all over. it seems that
the number oi cancellations are
surpassing the number of m
actually

Me

In essence, this is a slap in
the face of the people who have
supported and even made these
groups. it is no wonder that peo-
ple are confronted with difficul-
ty when they try to find financial
backing tor a pop concert. The
sad thing is this does not hurt
the offender but rather the new
groups who are still struggling
for recognition.

i:th for gripes, there are
still better things to talk about.
I do not know how the Homecom-
ing Committee has been ableto
do it, but they managed to get
one of the hottest rising groups
in the country, "The Magnificent
Men,” to replace "The Eyrde."
Everyone ins been raving about
the “blue-eyed soul brothers"
from Philadelphia. -

From their live concert sl-
bum on Capital, it is easy to
see why they are considered a
big thing. Their rendition of Joe
Tss's “Show Me" is fantastic.
as is their "Sweet Soul Musch
medley with imitations of some
of the soul greats.

As i said, there were many
surprises that night. The room
itself is not exactly the best i
luvs been in. The stage or wint
passes as a stage is no more
than a ledge protruding from
the wall. Imagine then, a full
set of "traps," a full-sieedbass,
a baritone and trumpet on a
ledge. Wint makes this entire
thing even more untastic is the
music that filled the room.

When the Spring Jena Festi-
val roared through this campus
and the Ted Cur-son Quartet play-
ed, 1 called them one of the
swingingest things toiappen. The
reviews tint the grow received
in Europe corroborated this fact.
But what i heard Monday night
set this group on an even higher
plateau. For, Ihave never heard
any jazz group improve so much
in so short a period of time.

Ted for one, has achieved a
degree of maturity that few men
his age ever come near. His

Ronnie Boykins is a new' sound

He is one of those bassists that

by Francine Hols

To the twang of the country
music oi Flatt and Scrugges and
the forth nervous appearance of
Mr. Fish from behind the As-
sembly Hall’s Wilson college
a siseable audience assembled
for the Readers' Club's first
presentation of the year-selec-
tions from the Sinclair Lewlsno-
vel "Elmer Gantry."

Presented both October 20 and
21 at t p.m., the reading was
humorous, lively, .weli received
by the university audience, and
on the whole a commendable pro-

explained, the selections illus-
trated the early years of the in-
famous minister's 11st. his

The audience met his atheis-
tic roommate, .lim Letterts, who
tried to de Elmer towardthe
higher things in life like "can-
ned miracles in chemistry." But

Roberts, the helliire and brim.

stone preacher and national pres-
ident oi the YMCA, and the uni.
versity's president, Dr.Quarles,
Elmer is led to-his true calling.

Krakower, as narrator, did an
excellent lob oi advancing the
story and his natural stage-pres-
ence gave ease and professional-
ism to the whole. Both Stratton
Rnwsen as Queries and Robert
C layton as Roberts gave excellent
presentations, much in the line
oi the characters they have por-
trayed so well in the past. Raw-
een with his comic gestures and
facial expression was easily
the hit oi the show.

Unfortunately, Evan Wilson as
Elmer Gentry and Andy LaPatra
as his roommate,Jim (Id notlive
up to the fine stanrlard of the
rest of the readers. Wilson never
achieved the passion which is
Elmer Gantry.

One never felt his last, physi-
cal strength, or desire for power
which is Elmer’s ultimate reason
for icining the ministry. Eventhe
early Elmer, the football hero,
did not come off. Although enla-

mations like "swell" and “you
ole polecat" are antique today?
they were real for Elmer and
Wilson failed to say them with
enough conviction to convince
even himself. This inability to
assume character is the central
weakness oi the presentation.

Elmer does not appear as the.
“heilcat” around whom the less-

or characters exist; he is, in .

fact, subordinate to them. La-
Petra, as Leggeris, lacked ges-
tures and visual contact and gave
the feeling that he was perform-
ing in a vacuum.

An attempt to underscore cer-
tain scenes with gospel music was
made throughout. Unfortunately,
the idea would have been more
effective if the music had not
been quite so loud as to drowned
out the readers. On the whole,
however, these weaknesses did
not destroy the excellent quality
of Lewiees' material which had
enough life, humor, and appeal
to envolve each audience member
in an enjoyable and delightful
evening.

Potter Club and Alpha Pl A1-
pha bounced back into the win
column. Potter rolled over TKO,
17-0 and APA defeated Kappa
Beta, 7-0, in a defensive battle.

Potter's offense, which never
got roiling until late in thefourth
quarter, was harried continually
by the gamey deibnsive Imit of
mo. The pame's first score
came when Mike Dreael recover-
ed a TKO fumble offa bad snap
from center in the end zone for
a safety. Another safety was
added in the 4th quarter when
on a punt attempt the ball was
centered completely through the
end zone.

Bad snaps were to plague TKO
all game, for late in the 3rd
quarter a bad snap caused a
fumble which was recovered by
Potter on the TKO 2 yard line.
Wasting no time Jim Curley then
hit Ray McCloai with the touch-
down strike. The final score of
the game came late in the fourth
quarter with the Potter Club of.

Curley completed five passes in

Alpin Pi Alpha in its victory
over Kappa Beta scored early
with a touchdonl peg from Gary

ino then hit Jack Fairbanks with
a pass for the extra point. Kappa
