I ’f'There’wlll be a lot  the way of sports
‘this‘lveekendi and it is hopedﬁthat’ you SUNYA stu-_

"dents (7), fansf?) will turnout to a few ofthe events.»-

'  cour‘ae‘there'a the annual soccer game. This year
"Utica College “will supply "oppositiOn." Without

trying' to psyche out the SUNYA hooters, itsh'ould

' "be understood that Utica was scheduled because of
” its, suitability as a homecoming opponent, that is,

traditionally bad talent. Nothing makes alumni hap-
pier or more proud than a» sound Albany victory.
if! were coming back to my Aimer Mater several
years after my graduation (pray ltl), i would be
more inclined ‘to send donations to my sports-pow-
ered alma mater rather than to a school at which
both players and fans showed little of the stuff that

makes winners.

Alumni would like nothing better than a football
team, and by the tone of the rumors ﬂying around
school, a SUNYA football club could become a real-
ity by next fall. Another rumor is that this school
will soon be training Phys. Ed. majors and that could
only mean football is just around the corner. Remem-
ber though: Don't put too much faith in rumors. Why,
I once heard a rumor that we were only going to have
three days for intercession. it’s silly to think any-
thing like that could happen in this day and age.

Another thing which might' please the alumni is
the fulfillment of' Coach Munsey’s long-time dream,
The Albany Cross-Country lnvatational. You wouldn't
be wasting a half of an hour if you went out to see

this

meet which will include Springfield College,

a high-finisher in the NCAA meet at Wheaton last
year. This team, in spite of all the competition,
might make a joke of the final score.

One thing dampens this attempt at a big-time sports
event. Where are the athletes going to change and show-
er. At the‘ time of this writing, teams were going to
be using sections of dorms as locker rooms. Eight
showers on two floors will serve the athletes assign-
ed to that dorm. ‘One question: What about the open
houses scheduled at the same time as this impromptu
locker room atmosphere is to be created in the dorms.
i could make some quip here, but if "Jock Scraps”
shakes up the administration, 1 best remain silent.

Albany course. Attwell ran the course in 27:29.
in registering their second shutout ofthe year.

ALBANY HARRIERS

  
 
  

Cross-Country Inv., ‘

Springﬁeld. Strong

Something new will be on the
October 28 Homecoming agenda
of Albany State University this
fall. in addition to a 3:00 soccer
tilt with Utica College anda10:00
a.m. morning contest in field
hockey between girls from Al-
bany and Potsdam State, the Uni-
versity will stage its own cross-
country invitational run. The

‘ event is planned as the first of
and annual affair and at thiswrit-
ing some 25 schools represent-
ing over 30 teams have indicated
their intention to participate! if
all teams show up this could be
one of the largest college level
harrier invitationals in the east.

The meet will actually consist
of three separate races, one after
the other! Junior college teams
line up at 12:30 p.m. followed
by the freshman contingents at
1:00 and the varsity runners at
1:30. The races will be run over
the new campus course which is
five miles long for varsity run-
ners and 3.5 miles for frosh
and junior colleges.

The varsity division boasts of
perennially strong and pro-meet
favorite Springfield College. . .
seventh in the nation last year
at the national meet in Wheaton,
lllinois. Also, the University of
Massachusetts, Royal Military
College of Canada, R.P.i., Ro-
chester institute, Oneonta State,
Plattsburgh State, Potsdam State,
Harpur, Stonybrook, Stone and
host Albany. Other possibilities
include Upsala College, Boston
State and Marist.

Among the iunior colleges are
Hudson Valley, Fulton-Montgom-
ery, Ulster C.C., Dutchess C.C.,
Dean Junior College (Mass.),
Canton A&T, Greenfield(Mass),
C.C., La Salette Seminary, Adir-
ondack C.C., and possibly Coble-
skill A:T, Brooms Technical
institute, and Paul Smiths Col-
lege.

Freshman squads will hail
from Rochester institute, R. P.l.,
Springfield, University of Massa-
chusetts, Oneonta, Siena, Marlst,
C.W. Post, Albany State and hope-
fully, Beaten State, last year’s
fresh invitational winner.

The favorite's role among var-
sity teams goes to the two Bay
State respresentatives, Spring-
fiied and University of Massa-
chusetts. R. P.l., Albany State
and Oneonta are expected to be
strong contenders for one of the
three prizes. Springfield is un-

n defeated at this writing, in two

ears-plus seasons. R.P.l. will
ave Bill Pollock and 8d) Whit-

l

by while Oneonta's Jim Devers
and Albany's Paul Roy and Mike
Atwell could prove surprises.

Auburn Community College and
Hudson Valley loom as the twoto
beat in the junior college division.

Hudson Valley’s Rick Spurling
is indoubtedly the area's top per-
former to date. The Coxsackie
boy is undefeated in two years of
running andsets records almost
every time he runs. He won the
Viking invitational Meet two
weeks ago.

Albany’s frosh contingent are
rated as certainly one of the
teams to beat out in the yearling
run, along with Springfield, C.W.
Post and Massachusetts. The
Great Dane yearlings romped to
the teamtitle in the LeMayne
Run a week ago, placed third in
the lz-team Viking invitational
in Troy a week earlier and have
shown a consistency to do well
in big meets. Larry Frederick,
Pat Gepfert and Don Myers are
the leaders of the"iittle" Danes.
Frederick won the LeMoyne Run
with Gepfert and Myers third
and fourth respectively.

Awards will go to the first
three teams in each division.
individual trqihies will be given
to the first fifteen runners in the
varsity race and to the first ten
in the fresh and Junior college
events. '

 

the Great Danes had seven men cross

the finish line before any-
one from Adelphi could fin-
ish the course. The second
place finisher behind
Attwell was Paul Roy who
finished a full minute he-
hind him. Roy was followed by
Paul Breslin and Joe Keeling
who finished only five seconds
apart. Don Beevera then cross-
ed the line only seven seconds
behind Keeling thus providing

close competition among the
anus .
Bearers was followed by

George Rolling and Jim Keating.
Jim Keating ovortook the first
finisher for Adelphi in the last
100 yards and thereby enabled
Albany to gain its shutout. The
first finisher for Adelphi finish-
ed the course better than two
minutes after Attwell had cross-
ed the line.
Attwell in Control

Whereas before this race, Roy
and Attwell had been slurlng
the honors for Albany, Mike com-
pletely took command of the race
although Roy did not run apoor
race either.

Since their openingioss to the
Coast Guard Academy, the Har-
riers have looked progressively
stronger as the runners who
were still out of shape at the
time of tint race have come on
strong to further bolster the
team's strength.

invitational Sat.

The team will have a chance
this weekend to show how strong
they are as Albany is hosting an
invitational Meet as part of their
Homecoming in which such
schools as Springfield will offer
some very tough competition to
the runners.

The subject of Mr. Lewis’ lec-

arisen in modern theatre because
of the misintrepretation of the

Folkainger Borden
To Star At “Eye”

Foiksinger James Borden will
be at the “Golden Eye" this Fri-
day in a program of largely
traditional folk music, including
English, lrish and Scottish
ballads and Yiddish and Hebrew
songs, as well as American
splrituals and blues. Borden
plays the autoharp, dulcimer,
mandolin and lute as well as the
guitar. For part of the program,
Borden will be assisted by
his wife, Jane, and young sons,
Erich and Scott.

Pastor of the Church of the
Convenant, Averill Park, New
York, Borden is a graduate
of Cornell University where he
was a member of Sage Chapel
Choir, A Cappella Choir, and
Cornell Glee Club and served
as a tenor soloist.

At Yale University Divinity
School he directed the Choir for
three years, during which period
the group made a recording under
his direction. Borden has
available an LP in hi fidelity
recording of folk songs and
Christmas carols.

Also appearing at the "Eye"

renowned "Stanislavski System"
of acting.

There will be no admission
charge for the lecture, but tickets
of admission must be obtained.
Tickets are available from the
State University Theatre box
office which is located in the
Campus Center at the Univer-
sity’s Uptown Campus.

Modern Dilemma

According to Mr. Lewis, the
dilemma of modern theatre has
arisen from confusion about the
interpretation of the system a
acting developed by the Russian
actor, Konstantin Stanislavski.

The StanlslavskiSystem, which
has almost lnfamously become
known as "the method,” has
drawn adherents to one or the
other of its two main parts and
seldom to both together asstanis-
lavski intended. Lewis feels that
as a result, most modern actors
either emphasize the external
techniques of acting or the in-
ternal aspects; so that on one
hand there is a group of memblers
who feel their wayihroughapart,
and on the other hand, a group
that considers motivation a dirty
word.

“Third Farce"

Lewis asserts that from the
two extremes must come a "third
force," a synthesis of the
external and internal which will
give us whatStanislavski intended
in the first place. The develop-
ment of such a synthesis is neces-
sary, Lewis feels, if American
theatre hopes to compete with the
wave of British theatre that dom-
lnates our own stages presently.

The Agnes E. Futterer
Lectureship at the University is
a position established by the
Theatre Alumni Association to
honor Miss Futterer, Professor
Emeritus at the university, As

RAY, NVEBEVR 3,.157'

A bill which attempted to in-
vnlidate the elections, held last
week, was introduced at the Can-
tral Council meeting last Thurs-
day night while the elections in
question were still being held.
Part l of the bill introduced by
Patricia Matteson proposed that
Central Council repeal the elec-
tion bill which had set up the
mechanics (1 the election.

The original bill, later amend-
ed also stated that ‘ ‘Central Coun-
cil strenously objects to and sets
aside the voting procedure of the-
current Student Association Elec-
tion."

Irregularities Listed

Certain election irregularities
were listed in the rationale pre-
sented with the bill. The first
irregularity was that student tax
cards were not being checked
against the student identification
cards. Another complaint was
that ballots were allowed to leave
the election area.

To support this complaint
James Winslow, representative
from Community Programming
Commission held up eight ballots
which had been allowed to leave
the election area and which he
had taken. He pointed out that he
could have mimeoed a thousand
of them and stuffed the ballot
boxes.

RevenueReceived

From Student ‘
Tax Falls Notably

Only 3,413 students have paid
Student Tax this semester, as
of Sept. 30, according to the
report given by StudentTax Com.
mittee Chairman Paul A. Downes
at the Central Council meeting
last Thursday. 0f these,5l were
graduate students.

The revenue on the official
listing totals $77,944.85, how-
ever, only approxlmately $48,000
of this amount goes into the Stu-
dent Association treasury. The
reason for this is that both the
student activities fee of $14 and
the athletic fee of $9 are in-
corporated under the general
heading of Student Tax.

Downes believes that the offi-
cial Student Tax listing figures
are somewhat in error, because
of certain irregularities such as
the inclusion of insurance fees,
class dues and other extraneous
listings in the final computa-
tion.

The figure of 3,413 paying re-
presents somewhere inthe neigh-
borhood of 50 per cent of the
undergraduate StudentBody. This
is in comparison to a figure of
91 per cent for the first sem-
ester last year and 80 per cent
for second semester:

Because of the $48,000 pro-
Jected revenue for this semester
represents only one third of the
annual budget of Student Asso-
ciation, a new Student Tax pro-
cedure has been instituted. i.D.
cards will nowbe checked against '
Student Tax cards when present-
ed to obtain admission to acti-
vities financed in whole or in
part be Student Auoclationfunds.

A new Student Tax policy is
in the process of being for-

I

 

After presentation of the bill,
the irregularities were discussed
until Victor Looper, an es-mem-
bar 11 Central Council, asked if
this bill were constitutimi con-
sidering the fact that last year
the Supreme Court ruled that
invalidation d electims did not
fall under the jurisdiction of the
Council but that of the judiciary

y No Suneme Cullt
At that time, however, it was
noted that there is no functimlng
Supreme Court. But if Central
Council invzlidated the elections,
the invalidation would still boun-
constitutional, even though no
functioning higher court exists.
There is noiunctioningSupreme
Court because there are onlyfour
appointed members and five are
needed for a quorum. There is
no constitutional provision for
appointing a member ofthe Court
except during the regular appoint-
ments in May nor for replace-
ments of a Justice who resigned.
There can be nofunctloningcourt
therefore until an amendment to
the Student Association Constitu-
tion is made either allowing for
replacement of a missing mem-
ber of the Supreme Court or re-
placing of the Supreme Court in
its entirety.
instead of passing an uncon-
stitutional bill, Central Council
amended the bill to say that
Council “expresses its disatis-
faction with some aspects”ofthe
election. in the bill, as amended,
it was also requested that the
Election Commission study the
election procedures and dissatis-
factory aspects, and also revise
the policy to prevent any such
problems in the future.

The bill, as amended, was
finally passed by the Council.
Did Not Know

Another point made during the
discussion was that the twoCoun-
all members who had observed
the irregularities should have
contacted the election Commis-‘
sion headed by Douglas Upham.

Both members involved stated

.that they did not know who to

One of the caniidates in the
Central Council replacement
election from the State Quad,
Jay Silvorman, was present at
the meeting to air his complaints
about the State Quad election
which was not held last week.

The election was held up be-
cause one candidate had loat his

were to begin. There was no
prod then that this person had
or had not paid student tax.

Most of Silver-man's points
were cleared by the Election
Commission. .

At the end (1 the council meet-
ing Klaus Schnltur readUpham’s
resignation as Election Commis-
sioner. Upham could not be pre-
sent at the meetim due to illness
but the Council refused to accept
his resignation, requesting that
Upham reconsider.

Another bill presented at last
Thursday's Central Council
meeting appropriated $2,180.38
to WSUA from Central Council’s
emergency spending line. The
money is to finance the improve-
ments in the static: made during
last summer. This ran the Can-
tral Council emergency spending
line into the red, but will be
covered by surplus funds.

Election Results

Two new members to Central '

Council were elected last week.
The new representatives, from
the Alumni Quad are Alan Cohen
and James O'Sullivan.

Positions on Living Area Af-
fairs Commission (LAAC) were,
also filled for three quads.

Those elected are Vic Looper
from Dutch; Wendi Feldman, Su-
san Filipelli, Kenneth Turow,
and Christian .l. Walters from
the Alumni Quad; and Mary Ann
