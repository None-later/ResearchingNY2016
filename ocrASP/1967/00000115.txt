BlackEyeResumed

Stuyvesant Tower will host the
third of a series oi discussions
entitled "The Black Eye"Thurs-
day at 9 in their lower lounge.

The purpose of "The Black
Eye" is to “unite students and
faculty members, as well as to
improve the intellectual climate
of the campus." Thirty-six pro-
fessors and members of the ad-
ministration have been invited to
participate in the program this
semester.

“The Black Eye" is intended
to give the students and faculty
members an opportunity to freely
share their views on sex, war,
education, and other current
lulles.

According to the organizers of
“The Black Eye" such a dis-
cussion enables the students to

' bonus waned with each of

the where. The pro-
fessors will not comment only
on matters concerning their own
fields.

if any student wishes to air

his own Opinions or listen to

those of others, then he is in-
vited to the lower lounge of
Stuyvesant Tower every Thurs-
day night at 9 p.m. Tonight the
topic will be "Drugs: Break-
through or Breakdown.”

Continuation of "The Black
Eye” depends on the success
this semester.

'. The University's Faculty-Stu-
dent Association (FSA) is a nut-
profit corporation designed to

‘, ‘provide services to the Univer-

sity as defined by theilwsofNew
‘York State; FSA lsrunbyaBoard

 of Directors composed ofeight
_, .tm University officials and one
Ustudent member, Ray McCloat.

.

Last week, FSA had a di-
rectors meeting to receive the
annual financial report as com-
piled by‘ the auditors Peat, Mar-
wick, Mitchell is Co.

The FSA fiscal year begins
at July 1 and ends on June 60.
During the fiscal year ofJuly l,
1966 to June 30, 1967, FSA made
a total profit of $25,674.16 as
compared to the 1966 sum of
$63,146.09. This represents
about 1 per cent profit.

The bookstore lost 33,652.80
last year] as compared to a '66
profit of $21,616.66. The major
reason for the big difference is
cited as the increase in the
number of staff; hence the
salaries of the bookstore em-
ployees has increased from $67,-
996.94 to $102,966.97.

Mr. Richard Locker, FSA trea-
surer explained that the staff
increase was necessary due to
the fact that the bookstore, is
larger, is open longer than be-
fore, and is operating a branch
office opened at Brubacher.

The barber shop was also a
losing enterprise since they lost
$3,746.77. Locker explained that

one of the reasons it lost money'

was because, it opened in the
middle of the year and most stu-
dents and faculty had establish-
ed barbers in the community;
therefore barbers' salaries were
paid but very few people were
getting haircuts.

The bicycle shop lost $2,562.67
for many of the same reasons.
There were salaries being paid,
very little business and the initial
cost of the bikes ‘was included in
the loss.

The faculty housing provisions
under the FSA umbrella provid-
ing short term housing used by
the faculty ended up with a $36,-
389.45 loss _as compared to last
years $47,396.13 loss.

The largest money maker was _

Food Service, which showed a
$306,164.41 profit compared to
last years profit of $276,803.76

offset the losses of the dorms,
bookstore etc.

Th! reason the FSA profit
wasn't larger was because of
greater increase to the indirect
expenses (e.g. office payroll $82,-
119.96; pension plan $35,600.00;
college activities supported $40,-
436.10 which included special
Universities functions; $16,.
667.90, student activities; $2,-
654.96 etc.); hence the amount
of clear profit after these ex-
penses amounts to $25,674.16.

The FSA report also revealed
these figures; the Student Asst-
clatlal spent $104,000.30 and has
a fund balance (surplus) of $32,-
796.46, and that the Athletic
teams have accumulated a sur-
plus to the tune of $154,522.40,
this compared totheirlast years'
surplus of $134,621.90.

College Offers
Info to Students

"information in the Disci-
plines" is a new program start-
ed this year by the academic
advisers of the University Col-
lege, with the cooperation of the
faculty, as an effort to acquaint
freshmen and sophomore stu-
dents with the educational oppor-
tunities available to them at the
University.

The next discussion" Adminis-
trative Services" will be held
from 3-5 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov.
7. in the near future the depart-
ments of Chemistry, Romance
Languages and Political Science
will be represented.

Meeting of “information in the
Disciplines" will continue to be
held in the Assembly Room ofthe
Campus Center throughout this
and next semester.

Prior to each meetiiu its sub-
ject and time will be posted
throughout the campus.

By‘ allowing the students and
faculty to meet together in an
informal atmosphere, the Uni.
versity College hopes that many
of the questions students have,
about a particular course of study
will be answered.

Meetings will vary in their
organization since each depart-
ment arranges its own presenta-
tion; the number of people attend-
ing has varied from as few as
13 to as many as 150. All meet-
ings are informal and refresh-
ments are served afterwards.

SchaeferDescribes Problems
Of A rtificial ‘Snow making’

by John Wanzer
Dr. Vincent J. Schaeier,direc-
tor of the University’s Atmos-
pheric Sciences Research Cen-
ter have a lecture on "Control-
ling the Weather" at 11 a.m.
Saturday in the Assembly Room.
Schaeier spoke mainly on the
process and problems of cloud-
seedlng and wound up his lecture
with a short movie whichhe made
showing the effects ofcloud seed-
ing, both in a cloud cinmber and
under natural conditions.
Schaeier pointed out that in
fact he is not a "Rainmaker,"
but a "Snowmaker." By the in-
troduction of foreign substances
into the atmosphere, such as dry
ice, one is able to bring about
a super-cooled condition caus-
ing moisture particles to come
together in clumps, forming
snow ﬂakes, which, if they hap-
pen to melt, form rain.
However, one of the problems
of cloud seeding is that the at-
mosphere must be recep-

Freedom Group

Young Americans for Freedom
has formed a chapter on the Uni-
versity campus, under the chair-
manship of Bert Devorsetz. The
organizational meeting Wed.,
Oct. 25 attracted apprordmately
35 people.

The organizers of the Univer--
slty chapter of YAF saw the
need for an organization of the
tenor of YAF on this campus,
with a philosbphy "which con—
cisely restates authentic Consti-
tutional principles" (according
to its definitive Sharon State.
ment).

Among its plans for the com.
ing year on this campus, YAF
will work toward bringing not-_
ed Conservative speakers to the

er.

live. Certain atmospheric condi-
tions must eidst for the cloud
seeder to be able to predict the
results which will occur.

One of the goals is to be able
to more reliably predict the
changes in atmospheric condi-
tions which will occur when a
foreign substance is introduc-
ed into the atmosphere.

For this reason experimen-
tation is now being carried on
in sparsely habitated areas such
as Yellowstone Park.

One of the greatest concerns
of atmospheric science is the
problem of air pollution, which

introduces many foreign par-
ticles into the atmosphere.
Sclnefer point out that this is
in fact not a problem of sci-
ence, but a social problem.

Cloud seeding is also being
used for purposes other tlnn
producing rain or snow. Atmos-
pheric scientists have actually
built storms, are working on
preventing hall in Kenya, which
ruins a great deal of the tea
produced there, and are also
working on preventing lightening
during the dry seasons when it
is a fire hazard.

Friars To Sing

A number of Folk songs will
be performed by The singing Fri-
ars tomorrow night in the Cam.
pus Center Ballroom at 6 p.m.

The nine member singing group
was organized two years ago for
the enjoyment of those seminar-
ians participating "and to pro-
vide relaxed entertainment for
their listeners.” Steve Torkel-
son, a member of the group,
said that "the stereotyped im-
age of the priest is broken down
once they appear on stage."

They sing folk songs and spir-
ltuals written and sung by pop.-
ular artists such as Peter, Paul
and Mary and The Kingston Trio.
They also compose and present
their own original tunes.

50th Anniversary

This year the sisters of Sig-
ma Phi Sigma Sorority will cele-
brate their 50th anniversary on
the Univsrsity campus. Sigma Phi
Sigma's history began in 1917
with the formation of the Eta
chapter of the national soror-
ity, Alpha Epsilon Phi.

When, in 1954, all nations!
sororities on this campus wele
asked to disband, Sigma Phi Sig-
ma, as it exists today, was
formed.

The Golden Amliversary theme
was reflected in the float that
Sigma Phi entered in the Home.
coming Parade. The ﬂoat de-
picted the 50 years of transi-
tion.

Following the Homecoming
Game, the sisters of Sig Phi
held an informal buffet for their
