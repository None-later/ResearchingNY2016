with these words, Dioklankow-
a. nudent at the University
' v V also chairman‘s! Camp

Board,. characterized a ,move-

‘ment to "humanize the snack bar,
the movement will include such
things as painting abstracts for
the snack bar walls,'making a
place to dance, aild rearranging
the furniture. ‘

Jankowsky’s plans however are
in contrast to the ideas of the 1
Community Planting Commis-
sion who are toaetasabodyto
provide for decorating the
Campus Center.

To meet demands made by
Jankowsky the Planning Com-
mittee therefore passedaresolu-
tion that they "as the student
advisory board for the Campus
Center, wish to invite all in-
terested. students to place their
art work in the snack bar area
of' Campus Center until Nov. 8.”

At that time the Commission
is to meet tolrevtew all work
placed there to provide for a
temporary coueoticn until such
time as a permanent decor is
decided upon and implemented
in the snaclt bar area.

Confusion arose over this new
policy when posters were put up
prior to the final signature dthe
resolution by Neil Brown, di-
rector of the Campus Center,
by Jankowsky and other students
who were catching on to the idea.

At that time Mildred Poisen-
sky, chairman a thaCommunity
Planning Committee, removed
the posters ullil Brown had given
approval to the resolution; after
Brown's approval the posters
were replaced.

Later in the week, under Jan-
kowsky’s auspices, the first
"paint-in" was staged in the
campus center, resulting in an
addition of a number it abstract
posters to the walls.

On the other aspects ofJankow-
sky's plan the Community Plan-
ning Commissim has withheld
decision at the moment; however
one member stated that if Com-
mtliity Programming Commis-
sion is needed for nothing more
than a rubber stamp they may as
well disband; at present they are
“re-revaluating ourselves.”

At present they are also con-
tinuing the formulating of plans
which were begun last year to
provide permanent redecoratlon
for the snack bar and other areas
of the Center.

Quad Establishes

New Traditions

The Colonial Quad Board,
tllrough a committee headed by
Marcia Cruz, sponsored several
events as part of Homecoming
’67

Thursday evening an auction
served as the quad’s welcome to
the weekend. At the acution, held
in the quad’s dining room, a
subscription to "Playboy" and
a Polaroid Swinger were sold.

on Saturday a Banner Contest
was sponsored, and all of the
dorms in the quad were invited
to construct banners with the
basic theme “Tradition oi Old
and New."

Eleven entries were judged
by two residents oi the Alumni
and the State Quads. First prize,
two kegs oi beer or thirty dollars
went to Delaney Hall, Morris
Hall won second prize, a keg
of beer or fifteen dollars. Paine
Hall received an honorable mell-
tion.

Because many ofﬂine
and students were an w
the idea, it is hoped by Quad
Board that the Banner Contest
will become a tradition within
the entire university with all of
the dormitories competing'for
large scale prizes.

New Nursing School
To Integrate Program

by Barbara Bernstein x
The organi' nation and deve op-
ment of a School of Nursing at
the University is presently under-
way; the school admitted its first
freshman class this September.

The philosophy of the nursing
program is that of an integrated
curriculum. Throughout their

four undergraduate years at the
University, nursing students will
continue to take a wide range of
liberal arts courses along with
gradual increase of specializa-
tion in nursing. 1

Dean Dorothy Major has been
instrumental ill setting up the
nursing program here. She is the
author of the West Virginia Nurs-
ing Plan, a program which offers
clinical subjects at'increasing
depth throughout the undergradu-
ate years.

Presently she is inthe process
of setting up a program with this
outlook here.

Pro ressivc Plan

The nursing program at the
University will be progressive.
It is hoped that receiving ex-
perience in each clinical field
will add “depth and breadth"
to a student’s knowledge.

The development (1 the Nursing
School at the University will pro-
gress along with the career of
this year's freshman class. Each
year courses will be"phasedin"
and freshman nursing students
now will receive their bacca-
laureate degrees in nursing when
they graduate in 1971. In that
year, total curriculum offerings
will be available.

The developers of the Schoolof
Nursing are in the progress of
selecting faculty. Next summer
will be devoted to developing
nursing courses for sophomores
and the preliminary planning of
courses for juniors and seniors.

Summer Planning

Each of the followingsummers
will be devoted to organizing
nursing courses at the junior and

senior level.

Each course in the nursing
major will include not only lec-
tures and; demonstrations but
clinical experience in hospitals
and public health agencies.

Enrollment in the current
freshman class is limited due to
the fact the the school was approv-
ed late in 1966. However, stu-
dents enrolled in other programs
and interested in nursing are on-
couraged to investigate the

possibility is transferring as
sophomores into the program.

About 20 places in this class
can be filled by persons wishing
to transfer into nursing from
other curricula.

At this time, hospitals and
other health agencies to be used
in the teachingofnursingcourses
are being selected. All orienta-
tion course is being conducted
for students already enrolled ill
{.11 ; nrsing program.

 the next month or so
the school uniform will be de-
signed. Arrangements for re-
sources are being made both in-
side and outside of the Univer-
sity, and the program developers
are meeting with high school stu-
dents and their parents interest-
ed in laaming more about the
nursing program.

Dean Major earned her
bachelor and master degrees at
the University of Maryland and
her~doctorate in education at
ladiana university. She is a mem-
ber of Sigma Theta Tau,anatlon-
al nursing honorary, and Pi
Lambda Theta, a national educa-
tion honorary.

She is also a consultant to
World Health Organization
(WHO), and has served as a con-
sultant to the University of Chile
for the preparation of teachers
in many health fields. She has
been a consultant to the Univer~
sity of Cordoba in the develop-
ment of its nursing school. Dean
Major also enjoys antiques and
finds time to paint.

Parade Honors
At Homecoming .

The winner of this year’s
Homecoming Float Trophy was
STB. The Colony’s float depicted
the transition of the consumption
of liquid refreshments from the
old campus to the new University
complex.

The prize-winning float had a
baby’s milk bottle symbolizing
-the habits of the old campus, and
a dummy waving a beer mug to
symbolize those of the new quads.

The brothers ofSTB provided
the man power needed to pull
their entry in the parade. The
float was assembled on top of a
car.

The second place f'oat among
the 22 entries w. . ' “

sisters used the theme “New
Campus Tradition: Gentle Thurs-
day." Their fleet depicted the
antics of the faculty and students
during the Gentle Thursday held
here last spring.

The girls of VanCortlandtHail
took third place with their "in-
creased Occupancy” float. With
the words, "as the prices go up,
up, up” on the side, the ﬂoat
carried multi-tiered bunk beds.

Honorable mention was won by
Beta Zeta Sorority. Their float
pictured afoot preparing to kick

a soccer ball. The theme was
"Sock it to 'em Danes.“

The theme of the Homecoming
Parade was "Traditions Old and
New.”

Alexis is a second semester
Junior who hails from Spring

" Valley, New York. she trans-

ferred from Harcum Junior Coi-
iege in Pennsylvania where she

~-received,an A.S. in Fashion Mer-

chandising. At Harcum the new
Queen gained experience in the
field of fashion and modeling. in
her freshman and sophomore
years she helped produce the
spring fashion shows and pre-
pared the commentaries for these
fashion presentations. During
these years, Alexis also worked
for Bonwit Teller in "Philly"
as part of Harcum’s Retailing
Work Experience Program.

Alexis has never had any form-
ai modeling training but feels
that a "positive attitude” and a
confidence in yourself are
essentials.

However, the fashion work of
her years atHarcum have nothing
to do with Alexis' plans for the
future. She is a Business Educa-
tion major and a Distributive
Education minor here at Albany.

She intends to combine the
positions of teacher and per-
sonnel director. in the latter
capacity she would work in a
retailing program with students
helping them to get jobs in the
stores of their neighboring com-
munities.

Summing up her feeling about
her new title, Alexis is “sin-
cerely honored and very happy
about the whole thing."

The Queen's attendants, chosen
by the panel, were Lynn Green,
from Beta Zeta; Ann Tenbrook,
sponsored by Psi Gamma and
Sue Chambers, who tranferred
from Syracuse University. Fran
Prelsner was chosen as the first
Freshman Princess of the Uni-
versity.

sion of MP at the Washington War Mobilization held two weeks
ago. Leaders at the Anti-War movement have predicted an end
to the non-violent means of protest.

0 End The WarAdvocates

CallForActiveResistance

Collegiate Press Service

The peace movement in this
country is not only attracting
more people from all segments
of society, but the emphasis is
changing from passive to active
resistance to the war and draft.

This change of direction, evi-
dent this last week in numerous
anti - war process across the
country, was also reflected in
the speeches and actions ofthose
attending the massive peace rally
between the Lincoln Memorial
and the Washington Monument
Saturday. '

Speakers at the rally who urg-
ed active reslstance to theAmer-
ican military machine received
an enthusiastic response from
the more than 100,000 persons
who came here from all parts
of the country to show their dis-
approval of the war in Vietnam.

Dave Deilinger, national chair-
man of the National Mobilization
Committee to‘ End the War in
Vietnam, the group which organ-
ized the demonstration, said at
the rally, "This is the beginning
of a new day in the American
Peace movement. We have now
become a movement of activo re.
sistance."

Yale University Chaplain Wil-
liam S. Coffin, who has been a
leader in the anti-draft move-
ments, indicated that the past
week was just the beginning of
resistance activities. He noted
that Justice Department offic-

ials refused to accept about 1,. '

000 Selective Service cards which
he and others had attempted to
turn in Friday, and said, "if the
government will not confront us
in a dignified way, then the gov-
ernment must bear the burden
of responsibility for a lot of oth-
er acts which are going to take
place all over the country."
Loudest applause

Perhaps the loudest applause
came when Lincoln Lynch, an
associate director of the Con-
grass of Racial Equality, called
on Negroes fighting in Vietnam
to put down their arms and come
home. “Our fight is not in Viet-
nam, but in the streets of Wash-
ington. Our fight is not in Viet-
nam, but in the cotton fields of
Mississippi.”

Thousands of students at the
rally heard Linda Morse, head
of the Student Mobilization Com-
mittee, encourage students to
organize student strikes and
peace rallies on their cam-
puses March 19, the first-an-
niversary of the first student
uprising in South Vietnam.

Miss Morse, who said stu-
dents from more than 600 col.
leges and universities attend-
ed the rally, received heavy ap-
plause when she protested the
use of college campuses for gov-
ernment research in chemical
warfare and for other secret
research sponsored by the gov.
ernment. "We‘want the govern-
ment to keep its creepy fingers
off out campuses, she said. "A
society which has turned univer-
sities into finding new and beta
fg‘ri- "ways of killing is perver.

There was only one incident
at the rally. Two members of
the American Nazi Party tried
to disrupt the whole thing when
they ran onto the platform and
knocked one of the speakers and
the microphone to the ground.
However, the speaker, Clyde Jen-
kins, general secretary of the
British Trade Union, was quick-
ly on his feet again andcontinued
his speech while the two Nazis
were chased from the stage.

the proposed new Constittdion,
adopted bytheConstitutionleon-
ventlon, and the Resolution sub-
mitting the same, be approved?"

New York voters will deter-
mine whether-the work ‘from
April A through Sept. 26 of 166
delegates of the Constitution!
Convention, costing the State $10
million, has produced a con-
stitution which they want their
state government to operate un-

er.

The proposed Constitution con-

sists of 15 articles which deter-
mine how the state is to be gov.
erned; the limits of legislative,
executive and judicial power:
and the liberties of its citizens
as expressed in the first or-
ticle of the proposed constitu-
tion.
When the convention met in
April of 1966 they were con-
fronted with the third largest
consiitution in the United States
—46,000 words and 19 articles
—belng amended at the rate of
six times a year_ for the last
six years. it also contained repe-
titions and several weak sec-
tions.

With such a formiihble task
in front of it the Convention
created fifteen standing com.
mittees, twelve of which dealt
with matters of substance while
the other three dealt with pro-
cedural matters.

One modiﬁcation of the pres-
ent constitution resulting from
the Con Con is the exclusion of
the existing prohibition’agalnst
direct or indirect aid to denom-
inational schools' or commonly
known as the “Blaine Amend-
ment." But this aid is also sub-
jected to the restrictions ofthe
first amendment of the United
States Constitution which is in-
corporated in Article 1 of the
proposed constitution.

This provision has created the
greatest center of controversy,
with the exception of the “Take.
it or leave-it" presentation of
the constitution to the voter,
concerning the proposed consti-
tution.

Opposing its passage many do-
clare that this is endangering
the "American concept of sep-
aration of Church and State.”
Others declare that the repeal
of the Blaine Amendment in the
new proposedconstitutionls real-
ly meaningless.

The first in a special
series 0/ articles designed to
cover the latest reports and
investigations on marijuana
and drug usage. (Compiled
from New York Times, mac/c
0/ Oct. 22.)

Dr. James L. Goddard, com-
missioner of the United States
Food and Drug Administration,
recently stated, "Whether or not
marijuana is a more dangerous
drug than alcohol is debatable -—
1 don't happen to think it is."

However, police Commission.
or Howard Leary believes that
narcotics-related crime is the
chief police problem in New
York City. Leary said that "the
police are concerned about stop-
ping teen-agers and young adults
from smoking marijuanaandaiso
with catching narcotic pushers."

A high-ranking police official
said that the Narcotics Bureau
was concentrating on “the deal--i
era, pushers, sellers, the high.
er-ups.” Also, "the only way
you can tell if they were smok-
ing marijuana was to take it to
the laboratory." This statement
was in reply to complaints that
marijuana was being sold and
smoked openly while police look.
ed on.

"Under Commissioner Leary

the Narcotics Bureau has doubl-
ed in size — it numbers about
260 men — until it has become
the largest narcotics enforce-
ment agency in the world.”

The size of the department
does not quell the fears of Dr.
Mitchell Balter, a research pay.
choiogist with the National insti-
tute of Mental Health, who be-
lieves that organized crime
might begin producing and mar.
keting synthetic- marijuana.

Balter said that reports in-
dicated that much the same re-
action is evoked from synthetic
marijuana as from the natural
substance and that small amounts
are now on the street. He pre-
dicts “a very big potential mar-
ket for synthetic marijuana."

At a conference organized by
the New York State Narcotic
Addiction Control Commission,
the college drugs scene was re-
viewed with the conclusions that:
"Approldmatety 5 per cent ofthe
nation's urban college students
have used LSD at least one time
and perhaps 16 per cent have
used marijuana.

“An increasing number of col-
lege students are experimenting
with marijuana but LSD use has
stabilized.

“The age at which persons
begin using marijuana and LSD
seems to be dropping.”

Another modification was the
. Judiciary. Among other concepts
Article V - Judiciary - declares:
(l) the state to assume the cost
of operating a unified statewide
court system over a lo-ycar
period. (2) remodels the state-
wide court system consisting of
a court of appeals, the supreme
court and its appellate divisions,
the court on the judiciary, the
court of claims, the surrogate’s
court, the family court, the civil
and criminal courts of the city
of New York and the district
court. The Court of Appeals,
the highest court in the State,
is granted authority to adminis-
ter the court system.

mission to the county voter the

Court shall be established. (4)
Required 5 but not more tlnn

of the existing 4. (6) The retire-
ment age of most judges is set

The Judiciary sectionhas come
under attack of being to verbose,
as has the whole constitution
been accused. This is countered
by those who feel that this final-
ly achieves the much needed
modernization of our state's
Court system.

other major changes or addi-
tions in the proposed constituion
are briefly as follows:

Article 1 (Bin of Rights): (1)
The legislature is to provide

introduction to a

and meanings of education
todai .
by Fredde .laffe
From the earliest age, almost
from the moment of conception,
society's most promising victims
are conditioned to view college
as a magic key to all delectable
goals. And then the arrival
as bewildered, impressionable
freshmen, only to find that the
carefully constructed dreamsare
a mirage; or to put it bluntly, a
total sham. Bertrand Russell cap-
tured this spirit in his statement:
"We are faced with the paradox
that education has become one
of the chief obstacles of intelli-
gence and freedom of thought. ."
Dr. Samuel Gould, chancellor
of the state University System,
spoke recently at Stony Brook
of the increasing power of the
student and the far-reaching in-
fluence of the university in so»
ciety. He emphasized the idea
that institutions of higher learn.
ing are becoming so potent as
to eventually outdistance the auth-
ority of church and state.

Unfortunately, the university

has become grotesquely distort-
ed into a public utility serving
society's purely techidcal needs.
in ell-chancellor of the Berkely
campus Clark Rerr's words,
“it is a factory for the produc-
tion of knowledge and mechan-
ics to service an endless amount
of bureaucracies."

The mainconcernoftheuniver-
sity should not rest in campaign.

tion and cost of local welmre

lo-year period,

Article in (Local Govern-
ments); Requires local re-
districting after each federal cen-
sus and "writes equal popula-
tion districts."

Briefly these are the high-
lights of the proposed constitu-
tion. Many pursue the argument
of presenting the constitution in
one package denies the voter the
possibility of voting down cer-
tain sections whileapprovingoth-

are.

This is denied by others who
feel that presenting the consti-
tution by sections would require
fifteen contingencies dependent
on whether the voter approved
one or rejected the other, or
any combination of rejection and
acceptance.

The forward to the booklet
now being presented as an aide
to the voter by the Constitution-
al Convention declares tilt “the
proposed new Constitution is now
in the hands of you the voters
—the 187th delegation.”

wealthy, producing bombs and
deadly molecular strains, or as
a model of architectural incom-
petence. it should not lunctiouto
preserve the morality ofthe mid-
dle class, or of the “Great So-
ciety," or of the white man.
it should not exist primarily
as a home-away-fmm-home, nor
as the breeding grounds of eroti-
cism, group minds, or masshys-
teria.

From the turmoil of the stu-
dent revolt at Berkeley originat-
ed this moving commentary:

"Tho university is not an ad.
ucational center, but a highly ef-
ficient industry. it produces
bombs, a few token peaceful ma.
chines, and enormous numbers
of safe, highly skilled, and re-
spectable automatons to meet
the immediate needs of business
and government.

As a human being seeking to
enrich himself, the student has
no place in the university. in-
stead, he becomes a mercen.
ary, paid off in grades, status
and degrees, all of which can
eventually be cashed in for hard
currency on the job market. Hie
education is not valued for its
enlightenment and the freedom

it should enable him to enjoy,
but for the amount of money it
will enable him to make."

Today education is valued with
a fervor which once was devot-
ed to religion or political ideol.
ogy. Youthful idealism need not
be burdened with impracticali-
ties. Before we succeed in shap-
ing the society soon to become
our pawn, we need to resolve the
doubt and bafflement about its
validity as mirrored on campus.
