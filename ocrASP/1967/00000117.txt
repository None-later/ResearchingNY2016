ing, in a burst of self-destructive energy,
a small faction of Council members pre-
sented a bill which would invalidate the
Who’s Who, Central Council and LAAC

elections which were then being held '
under the auspices of Election Commis-'

sion. The grounds for the charges were
alleged irregularities in the voting pro-
cedure.

This action was self-destructive be-
cause it was an open attempt by some
Council members to undermine their
own election commission. Furthermore,
it further disconsolidates the Council's
dubious ability to function as a cohesive
unit, capable of putting the general gopd
above pettyism.

' The members who went to the trouble
to extract the irregularities (and ex-
tract they did) could not, it seems, go
to the trouble to contact the Election
Commissioner Douglas Upham to inform
him of the irregularities. The reason
said members did not contact Upham is
that they did not know how to contact
him (or anyone else on Elections Com-
mission?).

instead they saved up little morsels of
injustice so they could feed them into a
big bill designed to shake the foundations
of Elections Commission, and ultimately,
the Council itself.

As far as injustice is concerned we do
not feel this was superior in the minds of
the members preparing this bill.Not only
was this bill an unofficial vote of no-con-
fidence in Upham and the rest of the Com-
mission, but it was also a travesty ofthe
ideals the bill was supposed to stand for.

Obviously the members interest in
justice did not extend further than in
throwing it into the Council's face;
obviously true concern should have lead
to a concerted effort to have the irregu-
larities corrected before any more were
assimilated.

JudICIary Needed

. When the bill to invalidate the elections
being held last week was presented to
Central Council, the question was raised
as ,to the legality of Council invalidating
its own elections; this question was simi-
lar to the questions raised in deciding
the validity- of the Spring ’67 elections.
At that time the Supreme Court passed
down an informal statement that Council
did not have the constitutional right to
invalidate its own elections.

Last year's Supreme Court action was
ambiguous, but at least it was there. This

there is no Supreme COurt. There is no

Court because, according to the Student
Association Constitution, there is only
provision for Supreme Court Justices to
be appointed in May. Last May only five
of the nine Court chairs were filled; how-
ever, those five chairs made the neces-
sary quorom. Later, one person resigned
leaving the Court with no quorum and no
power.

it is amazing that this situation was
not made public before this, and that im-
mediate action was not taken to amend
the Constitution to provide a clause for
alternate appointments for the Justices.
However, Jeffery Mishkin, president of
the Student Association, stated that he
doubted that he would be able to get the
20 per cent of voters necessary to amend
the Constitution in an election, and that
MYSKANIA was presently working on a
plan whereby they would assume the func-
tion of a judicial body. Therefore, nothing
had as yet been done to correct the
situation. '

There seems to be only two flaws in
this logic: first, the constitution clearly
states. through intent, that the Student
Association should have a functioning
Judiciary at all times; and second, that
even though MYSKANIA (which in-
cidentally, seems to have bogged down
under its high hopes) is still meeting at
a lesiurely pace of once a week to make
the supreme move, this change would still
require a 20 per cent vote of Student
Association membership to make the
MYSKANlA-to-Judiclary move constitu-

tional.
Last night a bill was presented to

amend the S.A. Constitution to make
appointment to Supreme Court more
accessible. it contains provision for
the emergency appointment of Justices
in order that, in a similar situation,
the Court can continue to function.

it also has a provision which would
reduce the cumulative average require-
ment from 2.5 to 2.0. We feel this is
definitely a good move because marks do
not necessarily correlate with intelli-
gence and capability, and because, under
the present requirements, we are not
filling all nine seats on the Court to be-
gin with. Therefore, it seems a new

measure would be in order.
it is necessary that the Supreme Court

regain its own power as soon as possible,
since the present situation goes against
the intent of the Constitution. it
MYSKANIA wants to plod along and
formulate a better plan, it can be con-
sidered when presented. Unitl then there
is no excuse for not; ’ I _ g ; every effort
to stabilize the ludiciari ‘ ‘ have now.

TIT: is part of the Noam
of thePelcOCorpl,butthemotive
behind this broad acceptance l»
licy points out why so many Vol-
unteers have a hard time stick-
ing out the two years, and Why
so many come home hating the
people in the coth Where they
have worked. .

The Peace Corps is an every-
man’s CIA—it is ansgency which
informs hundreds of Americans
about the countries of the world.
It gives volunteers first hand
experience in the problems of a
particular country. an ex-
perience which the us. govern-
ment hopes to use in determin-
ing our foreign policy there.

The Peace Corps also serves
to commit this wide variety of
Americans to the particular role
the 0.8. is playing in the country
they visit. Critics of us. policy
in Vietnam, for example, are
asked to defend the ‘American
way in Columbia and Kenya. They
are asked to help see that another
Vietnam doesn't happen in these
countries.

The US. government hopes to
accomplish this through several
specific tactics:

l. by obtaining information
about the activities at anti-Ameri-
can citizens, student leaders, of-
ficials, etc. (The Peace Corps
officials in Washington will deny
this and they are correct theoreti-
cally because they do not gather
information directly. However,
the CIA does make contacts on
individual bases — sometimes
just by inviting a volunteer out
to dinner, the agent can get the
info he needs without the volun-
teer being aware he is giving it).

2.,,_by placing volunteers in
those" programs and activities
which are chosen and acceptable
to Washington. (One volunteer
was told by an AID official that
their goal was to keep the stu-
dents in the classroom and out
of the streets where they were

demonstrating. This is why U.S.

rested‘ the programs, the volun-
teers might be working in areas
which would be against certain
American political or business
interests. The effect of this is
that the volunteers are working
to impose American values on
the people — by paying students
to study political science, for
example, instead of helping them
become effective in actual
political activities).

Yet the volunteers are hard
pressed to fuilfill these aims.
Most of them share the same ar-
rogance the directors of
as. policy have — claiming to
know what is best for Peruvians
or Nigerians, claiming that the
American way is superior to
their own.

In return the volunteers re
celve the hostility of the people
they are supposed to be helping.
They, as individuals, cannot di-
vorce themselves from the over-
all U.s. foreign policy in their
country. it does not help to say
that you are against the us.
policy in Vietnam, or that you
think U.S. corporations should
keep their hands off the natural
resources of other countries.
You're an American, and the
actions of your country all over
the world have spoken for them-
selves.

The naiveta of those who enter
the Peace Corps makes the has
tility that greets them a sad
thing. It is like trying to ex-
plain to a 20 year old black in
Harlem that you’re sorry that
you come from a_ nice middle
class home with two cars and
that you have a college defer-
ment, while he was raised in
a rat infested tenement and lost
a brother in Vietnam last week.

But the purpose of the Peace
Corps is not that hard to see.
The us. since World War Two
has assumed the responsibility
for the lives of people in coun-
tries all over the world. The
0.8. is bent on spreading the
American way of life over the
face of the earth. The Peace
Corps is meant to help them carry
out that responsibility by
committing hundreds of Ameri-
cans to the fight.

 

 

Even those who take our pre-
sent Student Government serious-
ly must admit that Central Coun-
cil has recently had a hard time
maintaining a minimum of
decorum and responsibility. The
latest farce involves the elec-
tions for Living Area Affairs
Commission and Who's Who. One
of the more egregious cliques
in Council was apparently out to
"get" the Elections Commission,
and sent out several agents pro-
vocateur to dig up violations of
the elections law. instead of in-
forming ths Commission of the
violations so that it might correct
its procedures, the vigilantss
chose to print up a list ofaccusa-
lions, and to generally make as
big a stink as possible.

The only tangible result ofthis
sneaky little play is that Doug
Upham, the head of Elections
Commission and one of the few
experienced Council members,
has tendered his resignation from
the Commission. This affair is
not likely to bolster Central
Council's shaky reputation.

As I have mentioned before,
i do not believe that these up-
seemly scuffle are merely the
product at personal jealousies
or immaturity. They are caused,
in part, by the low morals which
is as much a part of Central
Council as it was of its prede-
cessors. Central Council is not
primarily a legislative body, its
members are not the demosratic
representatives of an informal
and active electorate, and they
do not have - clear-c , ea

 

  

that extends up to the University
Board of Trustees. its major
area a; concern consists of the
care and feeding of various spe-
cial interest groups within the
student body. in any important
decisions regarding rules that
have a real impact on student
life, Central Council ranks very
low on a very tall totem pole.

Before Central Council can
possibly become a real power
center on campus, it must
disentangle itself as much as
possible from theidsa ofservice:
it must not be abody primarily
dedicated to"helping” the admin-
istration, or “coordinating” the
varied demands of the student
clubs and organizations. A leg-
islativo body exists to execute
the collective will of its con-
stituents and to exert leader-
ship consistent with its respon-
sibility to those constituents.
This means, in plain terms, that
Central Council members should
be elected on a one man, one
vote basis, that Central Council
as a whole should endeavor to
keep in touch with the wishes of
the student body, and especially
that Central Council elections
should be conducted on the basis
of issues pertinent to student
life. it is up to the candidates
themselves to thus elevate the
layel of campus politics, rather
than exploiting the political
naivete of students by campaign-
ing on the basis of personal
cliques. Likewise, it is up to
the present Council to offer con-
stitutional amendments restoring
the balance of voting pchr
between the general student body
