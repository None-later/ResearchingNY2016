Young Americans for Freedom
(YAF) is the newest addition to
the student political groups on
campus “Despite the grow-

America's steady retreat in the
face of communistdetermination
to dominete the world; and a
denim. in patrioturn and moral
standards, "use young people"
(meaning members of the YAF)
“have rediscovered C(mstitu-
tionai principles of government
and the actual rights of man.
They are privileged to beAmeri-
cans and are willing to defend
American freedom againstallon-
siaughts — domestic and for-
sign.”

Until 1 attended last week’s
meeting of the YAF, I did not
realize how misconstrued my
thinking on government policies
had been. i was not aware that
centralization of power in the
forms oi social security and
medical care for the aged were
such significant threats to the
freedom oi the individual. i was
actually under the misconception
that to provide financial aid for
those over 65, in sickness or
in health, was beneficial to our
social well being.

I was also under the miscon-
ception that our stands on the
Cuban Missie Crisis and the Viet-
namese War were defiances of
Communist aggression rather
than concessions. However, after
reading the above quoted poster
and attending the meeting, it is
hard for me to visualize my old
beliefs through the dazzling
visions of the freckled-face girl
next door, Mom's apple pie, the
U.S. Marine corps band playing
the Star Spangled banner, and of
Old Glory flapping in the breeze.

The one thing which impressed

by Den Gennett

   
  

  
  

me most with the philosopw of
the YAF was the stirring speech
delivered at the meeting by Mr.
Bert Devoreatz, chairman of
VAT. Before the speech, we were
requested to pledge allegiance to
the flag. This in itself did not
strike me as unusual. However,
the absence of a flag in that
particular room did. Duringhis
speech, Mr. Devoreetz refsmil-
iarimd his members with the
past actions and stands of the
organization. He reminded them
of YAF’s endorsement of Barry
Goldwater, its endorsement of
the proposals to repeal income
taxes, social security, medicaid,
and in re-establishing religion in
public schools. Never let it be
said that YAF doesn't know how
to pick the winners.

He also announced that the
immediate goal of YAF‘ is to
establish themselves on this
‘campus by obtaining a share of
power. Mr. Devorsetz would like
to see his members on Central
Council and the ASP, as these
two establishments, in his esti-
mation are fully controlled by
by the "new left.” However, the
most heated discussion at the
meeting when it was proposed
that YAF‘ obtain a table in the
lobby of the student center. Al-
though this resolution was poss-
ed, one radical member of the
group was held in contempt by
more sensible members when he
proposed that YAF spray the SDS
literature table with deodorant.
The other members contended
that such an action would be rash.

it seems that the YAF is like-
ly to become one of the more
influential groups on campus;
if not only through the appeal
of its political foundations, then
through the personal goals of
its well informed, fore-thinking
members.

Brieﬂy the United States Students

funds were disguised from allbut

Nation of four or five small
foundations which purported to
distribute them.

The purposes to which they
were put were partly legitimate
and laudable, which further con-
fused the consciences of the ini-
tiated student staffers who re-
ceived them. However, some of
the less laudable purposes in-
volved international student re-
lations. For example, trusted
students were sent atgovernment
expense to international student
conferences where they were ex-
pected to represent a stated
government line, unlike delegates
from other Western countries.
Furthermore international staff-
ers were paid to attempt tobring
the student organizations of other
countries into the International

i just don’t know what we can
do now. We had our day in
Washington- there were a quart-
er of a million people there and
they were peaceful and they were
committed to a cause. The war
in Vietnam is so absurd and so
vicious that i am disappointed
that we only had that many. But
one can take some comfort from
the fact that we who oppose the
war are no longer asmail minor-
ity; the better part of the Senate
and according to the Gallup poll
forty-six per cent of the Ameri-
can people stand with us. in
1008 we may even elect a Presi-
dent- in fact the hawks are on
the defensive now. But that is not
the point.

The war still goes on and
Lyndon Johnson seems hardly
about to change course. i am now
certain that his arrogance and
his paranoia. far outweigh his de-
sire for consensus and “res.-
sonin' together." This is John-
son’s War and it continues. i
suppose the March has accom-
plished nothing. Personally, we
each feel a little better at hav-
inil done something. So when our
kids ask what we did to end
that war, we can say with a
smile that we went to Washing-
ton on a balmy October day and
tried to do something. That pro-
bably is its only value. it didn't
help the young Gl from Brook-
lyn who is getting shot at Con
Tien and it did not help the
Hanoi family hiding in a dirty
bomb shelter. It made us feel
a little better. We went to Wash-

ington and we were betrayed by
the media. Any effect we might
have had was diluted by the
press and our three networks.
They said that we were asmail
crowd consisting of hippies, Com-
munists and a smattering of well-
intentioned though thoroughly
misled do-gooders. They knew
better. They had their helicopters
and their reporters at every
vantage point. Anyone who walked
back from the Pentagon knew
that this crowd was the biggest
thing Washington ever had to cope
with.

i am not sure that we can
do anything to make the TIMES
and ABC honest. if they feel
that it is in the national inter-
est to give the Peace March
negligible coverage and the Bat-
tery Park War vigil detailed
analysis, than we stand helpless.
We'll have to get to Johnson and
his warmakers some other way.
A number of my friends sug-
gest we utilize every form of
resistance to "muck up” the
system. i don't buy that. I still,
despite Johnson, have this faith
in the American system. i still
feel that if we elect Kennedy
President with a new Congress
things will begin to get better.
But the futility that so many of
my generation feel does indicate
that so many have lost faith in
the "democratic process." l sup-
pose that this is all to be ex-
pected in the only country in
the world in which the phrase
“pancanik” could possibly be
coined as a dirty word.

This is an open letter to all
the non-liberal students who have

pretending to be merely anti-

couraging non a involvement

New Left

To the Editor:

Isn’t the ASP part of the stu-
dent Association which repre-
sents all the students-at SUNYA?
Shouldn't it then represent their
views rather than those of a
staff with a very limited scope
of vision? in want to read about
the war, I can turn to well in-
formed writers appearing in,
newspapers and journals every
week. Where do i turn for in-
formation on student life? leave
the issue of the war to student
discussions, journals, profes-
sional newspapers, and even the
underground press. The student
press should be an informational
press for notices on university
activities and reflections on uni-
versity life, not an expository
for your almost New Left senti-
ments.

Speaking of missing the point,
"A Man And A Woman" seems
to have gone completely over
the head of Mr. Bordwell. He
says the characters were not
developed properly. We are not
told enough about them. This is
a love story, a beautiful love
story. it is necessary to know
the biographies of two lovers
to know what they have is won-
derful? Does there have to be a
moral at the end of the story?
Hasn't the reviewer fallen into
the Hollywood trap of wanting
a POINT at the end of every
movie? Movies should be re-
flected of real life. Everything
we do doesn't have to have a
point. Claude Lelouch has
shown us a beautiful slice of
life. Let's not ask him what
the moral is, there is none.
Let’s thank him for not being
"Hollywood."

Webb C riticised

Many music students, including
music majors like myself, have
been disturbed by the recent re-
views of John Webb, and feel the
need to question his qualifications
as a music critic. His comments,
the favorable as well as the un-
favorable, seem to have little to
do with reality. After readinghis
review of the American Str
Trio, l wondered if lhad attended
the same concert.

 

 

  

As" e.writer fer ,
ebbvhes a re

 the students end,tbeperar '
 artists to writewith

sion, but it is rather a question
of fairness to the performer and
honest reporting to the student.

Since music is difficult to
judge, it is essential that the
reviewer have extensive knowl-
edge of the subject, musical ex-
perience, and familiarity with
musical standards. ironically, it
is those who do not perform out
least do not perform well who
usually feel the most confident.

if one is reviewing a violinist,
one must befamiliar with the var-
ied styles of the top six or seven
concert violinists. is Mr. Webb
familiar with these violinists,
with their "schools" of playing,
with their repertoire, so that he
can compare them with another
violinist? i feel confident in stat-
ing he is not. '

His ignorance in the field of
music was exemplified in his re-
view of the American String Trio,
when he stated that William Schu-
mann's “Ameryllis” is "a very
contemporary piece.” Schumann
is no-more contemporary than
high-button shoes. Stylewise, this
piece (1964) compares to the
first String Quartets of Bartoim

Along with his lack of knowl-
edge, John Webb has cluttered
his reviews with frreveiant and
ridiculous comments. The body
movements of a violinist may
fascinate Mr. Webb, and lam
certain the internal organs of
vocalists, Miss Miles and Miss
Pane, are of great concern to
him, yet Hail to see what rel-
evance these have to the quality
of a performance.

To irrationally express one's
prejudices in a review, is not only
bad journalism, but also shows a
lack of maturity. It isnot my con-
cern whether or not 'John Webb
likes chamber music, but tobase
a review upon one's prejudices
and then to assume that everyone
feels similarly, clearly demon-
strates a definite lack of musical
integrity and fairness.

Whom is John Webb writing
for, if those in music find him
incompetent? is be attempting to
impress us with his severe
critical standards, or simply
amusing himself? Whatever his
intentions, he is not fulfilling his
responsibilities to the performer
or the students, and has suc-
ceeded only in demonstrating his
lack of ability and competency.

have vital interests.

“An open panel discussion on
pro-martial sex” or "a befud-
dled description of a dream-like
progressive college" can hardly
turn SUNYA into a “Berkeley
of the East." Even such “liber-
al” subjects as marijuana and
Vietnam are not particular to
schools like Berkeley; free dis-
cussion of subjects of this ilk
are common to virtually every
top-grade college in the world.

The statement that “We have
other things to do here on
campus" (things other than in-
volvement in issues that are the
most critical current issues fac-
ing the individual and his society)
is defensive of the practice of
withdrawing from campus life
into the introversion of only the
formal part of education. Ao-
tually, the student who gets the
most out of college will almost
invariably have received amajor
wt of III education outside
of the classroom, through free
