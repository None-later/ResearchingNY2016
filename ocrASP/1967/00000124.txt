The Specio for-
A View of the Arts
by Robert B. Cutty
One could say or the nowWest- point I would prefer to make It

on series on TV air this sea-
son that they are all "acciden-
tal comedies," but none of them
are truly amusing and few are
interesting. The only smiles re-
sulting from the contents ofthese
shows would be sarcach snick-
ers.

ABC has given us adultorated
history in "Custer." But as this
series (and its dreadfully mis-
caet lead, Wayne Mamder) is
due soon for a quick funeral I
say nothing more about it. I
will mention only tint its, sym-
pathetic treatment of the insane
a warme appreciated gesture.

Council Holds
Casting Tryouts

The Dramatics Council will
hold tryouts for casting in the
first series of original produc-
tions to be produced this semes-
ter, Tuesday, Nov. 7, 8:00 p.m.
in the Humanities Building.

All these productions will be
written and produced by students,
in order tint the student can ex-
periment with writing, actiw,
directing, and teciutical work in
an atmosphere where he will not
have to worry about pleasing a
large audience with a finished
performance.

After each production there
will be a workshop atmosphere
where students can question the
author, director. actors andtech-
nical people after the perform-
ance about anyan pertaining
to the play. it is hoped that this
will clarify any questionable
points for those concerned.

The first plays which will be
done are "Seek" or "Confusion
Minus Childhood," and "Images"
by Paul Struli. The first oi these
is to be directed by William
Schaeffer and the second by Paul

rull. Two other plays by Wil-
liam Gross are "Through Mid-
dle Darkness Barrie" and "City
of Brass." The first is to be
directed by John Ratio and the
second by Harvey Vlahos. The
try-outs are open "to anyone
interested in a truly theatrical
experience."

 

tint the people and events making
up the contents of this show are
(realistic enough to usully seem
believable.-

Series regular Stuart Whitman,
portraying the typical Western
sheriff legend, bears prime re-
sponsibility for this air ofauthen-
ticity. His performance is rich
with humor and hardiness and
the vulgarity and depth of ex-
pression that constitute the first
two qualities.

Shaw's atmosphere

Whitman is not totally respon-
sible for the show's atmosphere
of genuine excitement. The pro-
ducer has involved a talented
crew of directors, writers, edit-
ors and photographers with
“Cimarron Strip" and their tal-
ents are quite in evidence.

ABC's "Honda" stars another
perfectly-cast actor. In the title
role is Ralph Taeger, convinc-
ing and forceful as the movie
superman transferred to the tele-
vision screen. His performance,
however, is all "Honda" has to
offer.

Honda has been asked to scout
for the US. Cavalry because his
late wife was the daughter oi the
Indian chief presently suspected
by the government of plotting
a new, mass Indian uprising.
(This, by the way, is lifted
straight from the movie).

Indian slaughter 4

Every week, hundreds of In-
dians will be slaughtered in one
bottle after another. Naturally,
only the Indians will be the ag-
gressors, while the sympathetic
Army looks on with pity as its
soldiers (or troopers) dis-
paesionately kill off endless num-
bers of tribes.

ABC is also offering “The
Guns of Will Sonnett" and the
slaughter is just as regular as
in "Honda." Each week, Walter
.Brennan and his series grand-
son kill someone or several per-
sons as they search for gunman,
Will Sonnett, Brennan's son.
"Hondo" and 'Sonnett' both re-
ject suspense for calculated ob-
viousness and built-in boredom.

But NBC's only new Western
iswundoubtedly the worst in TV
history. Each week, the hero,
played with unbelievably awful
stoicism by Leif Ericson, will
exterminate countless bands of
Apchaes, Mexicans and outlaws,
all in the name oi progress and
historical necessity, God and
family, civilization and country.
Entertainment, right?

if the kind of violence evi-
dent in this series, "The High
Chaparral," is any indication
of what is next out of Hollywood,
1 can only shudder and pray.
For now we will all be treated
to the rare sight of total TV
immaturity.

The major goal of the editors
seems to have been to present

' a variety of literary genres, and

they have done so quite adeqlxite-
ly. "The Word" has everything
from short essays and poetry to
an attempt at writing a cartoon.
However, the publication seems
to have a deficiency where the
short stories are concerned.
Poetry Surpasses

The quality of the poetry seems
to surpass any of the other gen-
res. A poem that immediately
catches the.eye« is d. i. stim-
merman’s "Meditations from
The Hermitage." it lies in the
centerfold and the artistic back-
ground of the page reflects the
mood and tone of the poem.

Of even greater signiﬁcance
is the poem that lies on thepage.
Silmmerman’s poem is gently
lyrical and leads the reader
through the thoughts and emer-
iences of the narrator. A short
break in the flow of the speak-
er’s observations commands our
attention. He quite ironically de-
scribes the sea gulis as they
strut high in the dumps man
created and then points out that
the people at the beach are
searching for these creatures.

Resln's ‘Giri'

Another poem that should not
be missed is Lee Regan’s "Girl
on the Staircase." It definitely
surpasses the author’s former
poem on the same topic.Thepoein
exploits poetic techniques, such
as alliteration and word grouping,
to communicate the agony of two
former lovers who are both pull-
ing toward and away from each
other. These techniques show a
great deal of sophistication in
the poem and this sophistication
seems to be ctnrecteristic of

m ms in this publication.

Exam“ Face" by Sara Kitte-
ley is also well worth noting.
The point: is quite intriguing
and the language is often superb
for .the ideas the poet wants to
convey. The tone of the poem
is very emotional, as seen
through the turretor's desire to
escape the ugly sound oi a
screeching beetle. ,

The narrator runs "to catch
the mask" in order to hide wint
seems to be her fears and emo-
tions, and paradoxically the mask
of her salvation is also the mask
of her.destruction. It seems that
until the last four lines of the
poem the narrator has been hid-
ing "backstage" in order tocon-
ceal her true emotions.

However, at the close of the
poem the narrator seems to say
she has no emotions at all. The
emotional pltchofthe poem coupl-
ed with the personna's reaction to
the beetle do not seem to coin-
cide with the last four lines of
the poem.

End Muddlcd

The poems by Sylvia Barnard
begin well, but seem to get very
muddled in the last stanzas. The
poet seems to add a few lines
like “sex is a film of pubic
hairs" in order to sound neat,
rather than to add to the mean-
ing of her poem.

The freshmen show a great
deal of promise in their contribu-
tions although the poetry is shit
too didactic.

the end of the publication, is a

er pleasure, becauseofthe beauty
of the idea expressed.

"Road Blues" by Harold
Noakes has a very Dylan like
quality to it and yet it does not
lack imagination. The poem is a
beautiful expressio’n of the lone-
ly traveler and the blues he
sings of.

inality in the imagery the author
uses, and "The Kraken" by Col.-

Peter Watkins’ "The War
Game" (Cinema Art Theatre)
is a "documentary" about a rec-
ognizably contemporary England
under nuclear attack. it opens
with a panicky government try-
ing to cope with a Chinese inva-
sion of Vietnam and a NATO
nuclear attack on a Soviet-seal-
ed-off Berlin.

Swiftiy we are drawn into the
chaos of World War III through
the eyes of decent, ordinary,
uninformed citizens like our-
selves. Evacuations rationings,
Civil Defense, provide an omin-
ous ground base for the terrors
to come. A man grimly shows us
the shotgun with which he intends
to defend his bomb shelter.

Suddenly, the attack begins:
a child is blinded by the flash,
explosions flatten homes, fire-
storms swirl and spew flaming
bodies, victims are herded into
medical shelters. And bit by
bit, with a minimum of physi-
cal grisliness, the horror grows
until we are involved in paralyz-
ingly real events. Bobbies are
killed, looting erupts. At the end
we see people facing a world
with an unbearable present and
no future.

This story is projected with
maximum convincingness; it is
like watching a newsreel of the
future. The rough textures and
lightning, the landheid cam-
era, so reminiscent of TV docu.
mentary, provide an utterly
plausible visual framework. in
on-the-street interviews peo-
ple stare out at us and give
their ironically unIIuormed, unin-
tentionaliy revealing opinions -—

And such a flurry of imagina-
iive details Watkins gives us!
A policeman looks for his lost
family. The charred flesh quiv-
ers on a boy's arm. An explo-
sion, and we see crockery shat-
tering. A wounded man's hands,
trembling, lift a soup spoon to
his month.

One of the film's triumphs,

I think, is its fine sense of
society and social facts. We see
ordinary, convincing people re-
acting piausibly to a situation
for which they are completely
unprepared. The human detail
is Watkins' aim throughout. Even

say on "Podium Parchesi and

ing. There is an essay on jazz
by Lou Strong, and a short story
"The Redemption" is fair though
not very original thematically or
stylistically. A song lyric by
M. Romeling is difficult to com-l

music but the message makes
for interesting reading.

As i said before, "The Word"
is quite impressive, and any
comments that criticize the in.-

that I am sure you will receive
after reading it.

Noted Flutists

To Perform

Jean-Pierre Ramle and no-
bert Veyron-Lacroix, widely ac-

Sure For ‘Si‘deshow’

by E.B. Kaufman

Co-chairmen Carol Rosenthal
and Ellis Kaufman predict com-
plete success for this year's
All - University, Talent Show,
SIDESHOW scheduled for Nov.
to and ll. There will be talents
in all fields. In addition to the
usual number of singers, there
will be three different dance acts,
six folk acts, several comedy
routines, and a burlesque num-
ber.

Broadway seems’to be the big-
gest attraction in SIDESHOW.
There will be numbers from
"Name," “Sweet Charity,"
"Golden Boy," "Oliver," "Por-
gy and Bess" and "Funny Girl."
In the folk sections variety is
of the essence: there will be two
original folk songs, a Portu-
guese ballad, a Civil War song,

‘ and an instrumental played by

Neil Linden.

The opening number — "it’s
Today” from "Name," is a rebel-
rousing song and will set the
stage for the variedacts to follow.
This number as well as the
closing number will be done by
a chorus made up mostly oft‘car-
nival" chorus members and sing.
.e‘rss who appeared in "Carousel"

The chorus is under the super-
vision of John Webb who was
musical director for “C amivai."

In the field of dance, smE.
SHOW will present three differ-
ent acts. Kathy Kelly, a mem-
ber of the modern dance club,
will open the section with a
demo to “Ev'ry NightAtSeven."
Joy Couchman, who teaches danc-
ing to children, will perform a
modern dance to "Life Goes On"
from "Zorba the Greek." Kathi
O’Neil, will be dancing to com-
puter music in a sequence call'
ed "Computer In Love."

Dennis Buck, who has played
the piano for various other shows
and will be accompanying many
performers during smEsnow,
as well as playing his own ar-
rangement of Judy Garland songs
in what he calls "A Salute to
Judy Garland."

Although there is no specific
theme for the show, Beetle mus-
ic will surround the entire show
climaxing in "A Day in the Life"
which will close Act One.

The second act will bo high-
“Khted by a Golden Oldies sec-
tion featuring four performers
who have appeared in the show
for three years or more. These

Performers will be doing those
numbers which have “brought
down the house" in past years.
Completing this section will be
the team of Somerville and R05-
enthal in a satirical number from
"Mame" — "Bostom Buddies."

Comedy will be seen in apres-
tntation of two of Tom Lehrer's
more Popular numbers: "Smut"
alid "Pollution." Also in thecom-
9d! vein, will be the burlesque
5 “D which may be remembered
from last year's siww. In addi-

 

tion a comedy rendition of
"Grandma's Lye Soap"and“Lit-
tie Bo Peep," two numbers which
have been so successful that they
are being repeated for the third
year, are on the agenda.

All choreography for the show
is being designed by Kathy O'Neil
who did the choreography for—
"Carnival" last year. The tech-
nical arrangements are being
worked out by Sharon Westfall in
the capacity ofstage manager and
Eileen Deming as the lighting
designer.

Miss Wesifall has supervised
building and painting crews thus
far and will be managing the en.
tire backstage area during per-
formance. Miss Deming has
designed the intricate lighting
and is being assisted by Mark
Zack and Michael Walsh. Phyllis
Larsen will be at the sound
controls, and Alice Spencer will
be taking care of the properties.

Tickets for SIDESHOW, the
All-University Talent Show will
be on sale today at the Cam-
pus Center from 11 a.m. to 2
p.m. Tickets will be 50 cents
plus student tax or $1.00 with-
out tax card. One tax card will
be valid for two tickets.

Triple Bill
Planned
At

"the Celebration' by Anton
Chekov, ‘Deathwatch’ by Jean
Genet and 'The Dumb Waiter’
by Harold are the three one-
act plays to being presented
Thurs., Fri. and Sat., Nov. 2,
3 and 4, 8:30 p.m. at Union
College's Nott Memorial Thea-
tre. Tile box office is open daily
l-5 and 7-9 p.m., phone 340-
4098. Admission is $1.50. All
seats are reserved.

Written in 1004 three years
before the famous pluywrlght’s
death, the ‘Colobration' exploits
for comic purposes Checkllov’s
dramatic device of people com-
pletely unable to see the world
in objective rorms. The result
is a set of characters who cannot
communicate with ouch other in
any way.

The second play, first per-
formed in 1949, continues to
mystify and amaze audiences as
the vehicle for Genet’s grotes-
que vision of the world.

ilarold Pintor's most recent
play is currently enjoying a suc-
cessful and controversial run in
New York. ‘The Dumb Waiter,’
first presented in London inl060,
forcefully evokes, like all of
Pintsr's plays, the terror hidden
and inherent in our complex, if

There has been much dis-
cussion these past three years
about jazz musicians compromis-
ing their art.for the sake of
money. it seems that many of
our greats supposedly have bad
to lower themselves to playing
"Popular" music and Rock 'n’
Roll in
starving. What makes it worse
is that for each of these “stray
lambs," there are a myriad of
purist critics that hold their
{aggressions over their heads.

3'

When Wes Montgomery came
out with a series of pop albums
that were very far away from the
so-called jazz idiom, the critics
were shocked. Some of Jimmy
Smith’s latest albums have earn-

him the same rancor, as has
Cannonball Adderley's “Mercy,
Mercy, Mercy." According to
our learned friends in front of
the typewriter (sic), “These men
have strayed away from their
milieu and-have forced some very
mediocre music onto their fans."
Really?

New Albums

Freddie Hubbard has just
released an album called "Back-
lash." Buddy Rich and his band
have an album out called "Big
Swing Face” that is mostly Rock
(or is it?) Count Basie has an
album of James Bond songs on
the market and Lou Rawls is
singing more soul than blues
(or is he?) Comments such as
these have been used with a.
disdain that at one time was
reserved for jazz by the “long
hairs" (that is,the old longhairs,
not today’s). Now, it seems that
we who were once on the bottom
looking up and have now made
it. are now looki down our

order to keep from

noses at a lesser musicvform.
Why? r '

There are two things thatth
be thought about in this light:
First of all, are we to condemn
a good musician for playing a
type of music that we don't like?
In the case of Wes Montgomery,
is he vtovbe berated for using
strings and an easy listening
sound instead of his regular-hard
bop approach? Was anything said
to Carlie Parker when he re-
corded with a string accompani-
ment?

Jazz Experimenting

Since when has jazz been
against experimenting andnovcl-
ty?‘ For that matter, if Wes and
the boys are to be criticized
for experimenting, why no criti-
cize the "New Thing" or the
same reason, or is that going‘
too far?

The other point is a rather
sticky one. We have been hear-
ing for the past decade about
how hard it is for jazz musicians
to find work intheir own medium.
But the second the jazz musician
steps out of his medium to earn
money, well, may the gods pro-
tect him from the ire of the
critics.

The entire issue lies with this
fact alone. If a man loves and
works for his art, we respect
him. But, man must also eat.
So we don't respect him any-
more? Methinks that some of
our jazz critics ought to start
re-readlng the very books they
have written on the "concept
of jazz: the search for the new."

Composing Jazz

down to compose a piece of music,

tion to work with. tie can work
