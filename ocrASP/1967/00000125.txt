Fourth Time Around

A cowle of weeks ago 1 came
to a very late discovery. 1 was
at a party, making the usual
small talk, when lsuddenly hai-
ed on to the record which was
playing. I had‘heard it many
time before, but I obviously nev-
er really listened. “This is
great," i thought and it was.

The album, The Left Banks,
(Smash Records)- has been
around for a long time. It in-
cludes both of their hits “Walk
Away Renee" and "Pretty Bal-
lerina," but this was not why I
thought they were tremendous.
i realised that they were ahead
of the times, and even though
popular they never really caught
on because of this.

They are influenced by the
Baroque period of classical mu-
sic, exemplified by the use of
harpsichord, string quartet, end
contraptnital (adding a related
but independent melody to a be-
sic melody pattern) harmonisa-
ing. 0! course, this is a com-
mon style today used by the
Beatles, first in "Yesterthy"
among others, but when this al-
bum was recorded it was a new,
refreshing and completely over-
looked addition to current music.

The musical arrangements of
Mike Brown, who plays Harpsi-
chord and piano and wrote eight
of the songs on the album be-
sides helping on the other three,
are an innovation to popular mu-
s c. .
The reason is that piano and
guitar are still relatively incom-
patible instruments —- the use
of one subverts the other, but
Brown has managed to pick the
piano out of its rhythm keeping
capacity and raise it to a lead
instrument. Eventually this will
become a common thing because
it opens up even more dimensions
to music, but even todayalmosta
year after the album was made,
it is a rarely used technique.

As far as highlights of the
album, well frankly it's one of
those very few records which
is solidly good all around. The
first side of the album is excel.
lent (i say this because the only
tune I don’t like "What Do You
Know" - a kind of bluegrassy

' type thing, is on the second side).

Their vocals are tremendous,
especially those of lead singer
stsVe Martin. It is possible to
see the influence of the Beatles
on their larmony (listen to "Let
Go of You Girl").

The sound of the “Left Banks"
is unique and still vital. ltstande
aloof, both beautiful and haunt-
ing. l'd, like to see them to-
day, hear what they are doing

now: and hope tint even though
their popularity has declined
they’re still making a go of it.
From the album The Left Deidre
it is obvious that the group has
been slumefully neglected.

Another group that was shame-
fully neglected was "The Magi-
nlficent Men” at the Homecom-
ing Concert Friday night. lreal-
ize it was late and people had
to catch buses and other things,
but when they finished there were
only about 50 people around. Al-
though the band was disappoint-
ed, they put out even more for
those few loyal and loving soul
the who remained and it was
tbuose who left earlier who lost
0 .

“The Magnificent Men" are
tremendous, full of talent and
showmsnahip and they will be
big nationwide before a year’s
time is up — so if you were one
of those who got scared because
you saw a sax and trumpet (and
thought what kind of rock band
is this?) and then left — tough
luck, baby.

gees, asks quickly, "We won't

A salesman hlandly states his
price list for sandbags —"extra

And, when the interviewer asks
a group of ragged, vacant-eyed

to the camera — to us — "1
don't want to be nothing when i
grow up."

This is ready-made, emotional
material, but Watkins has avoid-
ed maudlin sensationalism. The
argument is starchin presented,
and the restraint makes it all
the more gripping. At times it
testers on the edge of preachi-
uess, but it almost always
recsovers.

This film must of necessity
be an individual sisterience; so
the fact tint i wept does not
really hear on your response.
But i would screen this film

Golden Eye may get it; it may
even come to Albany theatres.

 

I

 

i am beginning to think that perhaps the name
Philadelphia casts some kind of magic spell over
. orchestras, because 1 have now aaentwo “Phila-

delphia” Orchestras which need certainly im- .

pressed and thriued ms to no and. The second of
these is the Chamber Symphony d Philadelphia

’ under the baton of Anshel Brusilow. Do not con-
fuse this group with the Philadelphia Orchestra
of Eugene Ormandy, even though Mr. Brusiiow
was once concertmaster d the group. .

This thirty-six piece orchestra wasformed as
recently as 1900, and certainly has achieved, in
such a short time, a very fine sound and very
closely knit rapport with its conductor. OnMon-
day night, this orchestra presented a very de-
lightful concert including: "ll Signor Brushino
Overture” by Rossini, "Don Quixote Suite” by
Telemann, Haydn's ' ‘Symphony No. so in D
Major," - andumian’s “Cantus Anlmae et
Cordis," and "Symphony No. 2 i113 Flat Major"
by Schubert.

The Rossini Overture was a terribly clever
opening number, and i might add, a marvelous
place to put Rossini, because of his light and

‘rapidly moving phrases. Even the producers of
“The Lone Ranger" realised this when they made
the main theme of his famous “William Tell
Overture" the theme song. The first thing to
strike me was the marvelous violin section with
its delightftu light, ﬂoating and melodic tone

quality. They shone again and again throughout ‘

the concert, coming to their most impressive

dimensions in the Schubert Symphoriy.‘Clever

little "hits" such as the tapping d the bows

against the violins, and the surprise tapping of

feet at the and made this a trulyexciting number.
Don Quixote suite

The “Don Quixote Suite” was composed of

several parts: the overture, Don Quixots's

‘ awakening, the attack upon the windmills, the
love-sigh for the princess Aline, hails-scarred
Sancho Panza, Rosinate gallop, the gallop of
Sancho Panza's donkey, and Don Quixote's rest.
The number was very amusing, and seemed to end
so fast the I thought they had left part of it out.
One of the orchestra's most outstanding techni-
ques was used at the end of this piece, and that
was the dccresendo into nothing, despite moving
tones. it was really very etfective.

Mr. Brusilow commented on the Haydn Sym-
phony, saying that it was a comic symphony, and
should be enjoyed that way. it is written in the
style of an “absent-minded professor" who

writes things and then forgets what he is doing.

Finally, after trailing iii, he comes back to his
senses. This sort it thing happens throughout
the number when the orchestra sdtens and then
surges back to repeat what it has justplaysd. in
the last movement the violins play some rattler
dissonant church which bring orchestra. mem-
bers to their feet, and men from the wings. it
was a verydelightfullynovel piece sndescsllent-
ly performed. ~

The Yardumian Cantus was a contemporary
composition, and although not at all outstanding,
was well performed. Perhaps the most dynamic
and surging movements were exhibited in this
work, and were very well done. Again, the end-
ing — the fade into nothingrless — brought
this number to a most impressive close.

Final Number

For its final number, the orchestra chose'
the light and enjoyable Schubert “Symphony
No. 2." One outstanding aspect was the playing
of the extremely fast-moving parts by the cellos
and basses. it seems much more awkward and
difficult to execute such moves on these instru-
ments than on the viloins.lmust alsoleave room
to comment’ most favorably on the excellent
brass section which, although very small, play-
ed smoothly and perfectly. Their entrances were
clean and smooth, creating no abrupt contrasts.

The well-deserved applause brought the con-
ductor back three times, and, 1 guess, made him
decide to play as an encore the absolutely
beautqu "Air from the 3rd Suite" by Bach.
This piece proved the ability of the orchestra
to generate the sentimental feeling in this very
melodic little number.

Mr. Brusilow, as a conductor, is very rc-
freshing to watch. He has a wonderful style
which, without superfluous flourishes, gener-
ates the music through his hands and arms. A
staunch fan of Eugene Ormandy, suchas myself,
cannot help but wonder if his style, his sound,
and his product couldn't perhaps show a hint of
Ormandy influence.

This excellent concert was only one in a

' series of excellent performances to be given

here at State under the auspices of Music Coun-
cil. l must say that it is good to finally see such
fine, name guest artists appearing here. Try not
to miss Jean Pierre Rampal— flute, and Veyron
LaCroix —— Harpsichord on Tuesday, Nov. 7, and
of course, the famous Eastman Wind Ensemble
on Sunday, Nov. 19. Watch for ticket sales, be-
cause you won't want to miss these per-
formances.

For Lasting Success

A new magazine has appeared
which seems to he destined for
success. it is CHEETAH and is
published by the Twenty First
Century Publishing Co., inc.
which has something to do with
the discotheque in Fun City.

The entire cover price of fifty
cents is well worth it because
on the inside cover foldout, there
is found a full color pinup of
Mama Cass Elliot lying on a bed
of flowers. it seems as though

Cass has Indicated every
woman's desire to be a pinup

This week in League lPotter
Club continued its drive for the
championship by rolling over
Kappa Beta 26-0, while the Nada
played spoiler, upsettinga strong
Alpha Pi Alpln team 7-6.

The passing combination of
Jim Curlsy to Dan Crippen con-
tinued to be successful withCrip.

strikes in Potter's one sided win
over Kappa Beta. ,

Potter struck early as Curley
hit Crippen for two touchdowns
in the first half, with Curley
adding the first extra point on
a run behind fine blocking and
the second on another pass to
Crippen.

Kappa Beta then received the
opening kickoff of the second half
only to be stopped once more by

, the fins Potter defense led by
Jim McVey and Jim Waihel. Pot-
ter then seemed to be stalled by
a rallying KB defensive unit as
a third down and long yardage
situation came up. However Cur-
ley wasn't to be denied as he roll-
ed out and hit Ray McCloat with
his third touchdown pass of the
day. The point after try failed,
but it didn't really matter as Pot-

were either off the mark or stop-

shot at a vacant goal when the

day with Curley throwing once
more to Crippen for another
touchdown. Once more the extra
point failed, making the final
score Potter 26, KB 0.

Then the Nads capitalizing on
a blocked punt by A1 Setil scor-
ed early in the second quarter of
their game with a seeming-
ly stronger APA team. After the
block the Nads quarterback Bill
Shiftman tried 3 straight square
outs to his left end, George Webb
with the final one being caught
for the touchdown. Shiftman then
hit Webb again for the extra
point making the score Node 7,

APA then tried to battle back
and get on the scoreboard, but
each attempt was stalled as How-
ie Dobbs and Jack Bird picked
off 3 passes in the first half.
in the third period they once
more failed to score as a block-
ed punt gave them fine field po.

it off with a touchdown pass to
Lance Borofsky. However the

eleven minute mark, Andy Ytur-
raspe fed Joel Volinski beautiful-
ly in front of the Dutchess net
for Albany's first score. With
only two minutes gone by in
the second half, Terry Jordan,
normally second string goalie,
now converted right wing, played
his position perfectly and scored
off a pass from Volinski to put
the no-so-Great Danes ahead 2-0.
The only score for Dutc hess came
at the 2:30 mark of the final

The Fresh have now recorded
first, second and third place
finishes in lnvitationals, and are
3-1 in dual meets. This is one of
Albany’s finest freshmen teams
ever, and next year they should
be able to move up to the varsity
and fill the holes that will be
created by graduation. Thus
coach Munsey should once again
be provided with the nucleus of
a fine squad.

The fresh still have two meets
remaining. On Saturday they will

meet will be Tuesday when they
travel to Syracuse to take on the

hany State University basketball season may be long‘off, I»
but for coach Richard Sauers, it has already begun. Players have participated in outdoor I

conditioning since. the beginning of the season with formal workouts. having started
‘ October 16 at Cardinal McCloskey High School where the first 'games of the season will
be played until the opening of the new gym sometime in January or February.

cinity, the two gyms will
constitute his fith and sixth
. "home" courts since he be-
gan his basketball coach-
ing career here in 1955.

"Doc," as he is known by
his colleagues, friends and
players, comes to Albany
via lrwin, Pa. where he attended
Penn Joint High School. in 1951,
he received his 8.8. from Slip-
pery Rock, accumulating four
basketball letters and one base-
ball and tennis letter. After a
stint in the navy, the Albany
mentor entered Penn state in
1954, receiving his Masters in
June, 1955, and his Doctorate
in 1961.

in addition to his basketball
duties, Dr. Sauers has been var-
sity golf coach since 1959. His
teams have luvs only two los-
ing seasons and his 1964 squad
went to the small-college NCAA
iguzrpey, placing ninth in a field

Sauers is also one of the best
handball and golf players in the
area. He has captured the dis-
trict handball championship
twice, finishing second in 1967
and fourth in the state. He has
been number one man at the Al-
bany YMCA the last seven years.

A two handicappsr in golf,
"Doc" has been runner-up twice
(1964 and 1986) in the ENYGA.
He and his wife, the former
Elaine Sykes, who is an excel-
lent goifer in her own right,
live at 22 DeLee Ave., West-
mere. They have a two-year-old
daughter and a seven-month-old
son.

As a member of the NAIA
Sauers coached five tournament
teams from district 31. Now a
member of the NCAA, the A1-
bany teams in the past have
been considered for regional
bids, but never received the
coveted invitation. With the looks
of a talented team and an emf.

this may be the year.
