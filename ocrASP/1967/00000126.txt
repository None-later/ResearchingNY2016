1 hate tormake this column into a feature where

i write‘something one week and apologize for. it the
next, butldc feelan apology is in order. After the
columnar 'lsst'week'was in print,.l learned that the
Utica College game 'was not scheduled for homecom-
ing originally, but instead was forced into that slot
,when homecoming was pushed back a week.-l apolo-
' gize to Dr. Werner and Coach Garcia for the lack of
information on my part, but i should add'that my
guess is that neither of these two men lost any hair
‘when they learned that Utica would be the new home-
,coming'opponent. What i did mean, however, is that
Utica was indeed a suitable homecoming "opponent," .
as anybody who saw the game could testify. When
one local soccer player iremarked, "A high school
team in this area could have beaten them," an indi-
cation ,of the talent on the visiting team could be
grasped. Apparently the-Great Dane team read the
banner hanging from Livingston Tower which beamed,

"Put Utica's Club on tap."

Congratulations should go

out to Ceach Garcia who took advantage of the weak
opposition by giving all players a little bit of game
experience, a feature Garcia teams have often lack-

ed in the past. '

Congratulations go out to Coach Munsey for the
fine Albany Cross-Country invitational he provided
the Albany fans this past Saturday. The old sports
cliche that good teams attract fans became obvious
as 400 people packed the sidelines to view the spec-

tacle.

Springfield College provided the'fans with two
qualities admirable to the cross-country sport as

five Springfield runners

crossed the finish line

hand in hand, thus, no runner took individual honors.
All five of the runners, however, share the course
record which they established, destroying the old
record by 35 seconds. The fine exhibition of excellent
running and true team spirit speak very admirably
for the Springfield club. Certainly, SUNYA fans should
be proud of their own Great Dane barriers, who fin-
ished in third place behind the two pre-meet favor-
ites, Springfield and Boston State.

3-0,

Swartout Nets 2

by Dunc Nixon

With inside left Gary
Swartout leading the way
the Albany State soccer
team romped to an easy 3-0
Homecoming win over
'Utica on Saturday. The win
gives the Great Danes a 3-6
record with two games remain-
M- 
Albany easily outclassed the
titles squad and the score miglt
have been considerably higher
if coach Garcia had not substi-
tuted so freely.

The Great Danes got on the
scoreboard midway through the
first period when Swartout took
a cross from halfback Tony Glas-
er snd pushed it into an open
goal.

The same combination clicked
again late in the third period
and the Great Danes led 2-0.
This time Swartout headed it
past the goalie and into the cor-
ner.

Sheer Scores t'tiincher'

Jim Sheer came through with

I the clinching goal in the fourth

quarter when he took space from
Basil Morgan and scored from
close range. A good indication of
how thoroughly Albany dominated
the game is given by the faetthat
Jerry Leggieri was called upon
for, only 4 serves and reserve
goalie Lew Kahler played the
whole fourth quarter without hav-
ing to make a single save.
Besidea Swartout and Glaser
standout performances were also
turned in by fullbacks John Com-
esu and Roger Saul, and by cen-
er half Tim Jursek. However,
the win was somewhat rimmed
by injuries to lineman l'hil Kenn
and fullback Joe LaReau.

On Wednesthy the Great Danes
traveled to RPl where they suf-
fered a discouraging 3-0 loss,
with the Engineers gettiw an
three goals in the second period.
The Great Danes were not that
badly outclast but defensive
lapses and the offense's inability
to beat RPl's fine goaltender
resulted in the loss.

Albany traveled to New Pelt:
yesterrhy, and on Saturday they
win return home to host stony

Five Win Hand-ily

Top

The first Annual Invitational Cross-Country meet was run this Saturday before a crowd
of approximately four hundred people. Springfield College, with an overpowering team,
placed the first five finishers in the race. The first five of Craig Bennet, R01 Cormier,
Ken Cletka, Russ Pate and Bill Tramposch crossed the finish line holding hands and set

a course record of 26:51, breaking the old record by a full 35 seconds.

Of the eleven schools competing, Albany State finished third behind Boston State as

well as Springfield". The

final score was Springfield

15, Boston 71 and Al-

bany 79. '
Attwell First

Mike Attwell, who nearly
e the course record in his

last race, was the first finish-
er for Albany and eleventh in
the meet. Attwell recorded a
time of 27:34. Co-captain Bob
Mulvey, who was running in his
last home meet was the second
finisher for the Great Danes
as be crossed the finish line in
16th place. Mulvey ran an out-
standing race as he outran oth-
er members of the team who
had been beating him an year.
Paul Roy, who has been com.
peting with Attweil for top-
honors for Albany was the next
to finish as he placed 17th. The
other two finishers for Albany
who figured in the scoring were
Joe Keating who finished 23rd
and Paul Breslin who finished
26th. Keating, the team's other
co-captain, also ran well to gain
his niece.

Springfield Ovemowering

airingfield's five runners
opened the race with a quick
pace which they held through-
out the race. One of Boston's

runners was able to keep up with
them until just after the two mile
mark when the pack pulled away.
The Springfield men showed fine
team spirit as they grouped to.
gather just before the finish rath-
er than crossing separately.

    

Coach Munsey, commenting on
how the meet was handled said
that he was pleased to see every-
thing move smoothly and was
vary impressed ' ‘v the fine fan
support and the ' reofthecrowd.
He also remarked that he is look-
ing forward to next year's invita-
tional and some more sharp com-
petition among the schools.

meets are both awayasthey trav-

Central Council tabled a pro-

Thursday night. Council also re-
ferred to Election Commission
a bill providing for new elec-
tion proceedures and passed a
third bill to improve the com-

of student government.

The bill to amend the Student
Association Constitution allowed
for the replacement of Supreme
Court Justices when vacancies
occur and made other changes in
the Judiciary and was tabled until
the next business meeting on the
Thursday following an evalua-

Democrat Regulars

by Ed Silver

Election Day, this past Tues-
day, Nov. 7, saw for the 44th
consecutive year all Albany Coun-

ty and City wide offices and

majorities of the different coun-
cils went to the regular Demo-
crats by large margins.

in the City of Albany elec-
tions were held for the several
city judges and for the 19 City
Aldermen; in Albany County for
Clerk, Sheriff, Coroner and
County Legislators,

‘A Piece Of

To Premier

An original one-act play, "A
Piece of Cake," will be present-
ed by the State University Thea-
tre Nov. 15 - 18 in Richard-
son 201,

Part of the Thesis Laboratory
Production, the play was written,
directed by Wiliam A. Frank-
onis, a graduate student in the
Department ofSpeech and Drama-
tic Art at the University,

Because of scheduling difficul-
ties, the normal 8:30 p.m. curtain
had to be abandoned for opening
night. Therefore, although the
Wednesday performance will be-
gin, at 10:17 p.m., the remain-
ing performances, Thursday
through Saturday nights, will
start at the regular time,
8:30 p.m.

Frankonis describes his play
as an experiment in audience
involvement, and part of involv-
ing the audience, he feels, neces-
sitates changing the usual pattern
of theatre-going.

Thus, Frankonis sees nothing
terribly upsetting about having
his opening night curtain later
than the opening time. He states,
"Those who show up that night
will be there because they really
want to be at a theatre. it won't
be a routine pattern but a con-
scious effort."

The director-author adds that
the entire reduction of his play
is devote to breaking many

, acceptedtheatre practices. The,

tions were challenged by reform
candidates running under the sus-
pices of either the Republican,
Liberals or AIM.
Votc Challenged
All these reform and opposi-
tion candidates were defeated
according to first tallies. in two
cases, reform candidates lost
by negligible margins. The Re-
publicans challenged the election
of John Bartlett, opposing Rena
Posner, the A1 M-Republican can-
didate for County Clerk. A County
Legislative race within city
limits was also contested.

audience will find itself sitting
in a manner atypical ofmostper-
formances, so they willbe forced
to observe tie play differently.

Frankonis says he is interest-
ed in discovering just what can
occur when theatre concentrates
almost solely on the relationship
between the actor and the spec-
tator. His cast, Jay Kupormnn
and Beth Snbowitz, will empha-
size this relationship in their
attitude and response tothe spec-
tutor.

"A Piece of Cake" is the
second Thesis Laboratory Pro-
duction atthe University, the first
having been “Waiting for Godot,"
shown at Richardson 201 last
spring. Frankonis' laboratory
production partially fulfills the
requirements for his Master's
thesis in Dramatic Art.

Frankonis, who taught in high
school for three years before
commencing graduate study,
currently holds a graduate assis-
tantship with the State Univer-
sity Theatre. His thesis, in addi-
tion to the original script and
production, will include ananaly-
sis of audience involvement.

There is no charge for tickets
for "A Piece of Cake." Butsinco
there can only be fifty people in
the audience each night, tickets
of admission must be obtained
in advance. Tickets are present-
ly available at the State Univer-
sity Theatre Box Office at the

beginning doctoral study in pro-
paration for college teaching;

ed doctorai study in arts, science,

to be appointed without regard
to their class year. Under the
present system, Sophomores,
three Juniors and four Seniors
must be appointed.

Also amended in the preposed
bill is the restriction onJustices
prohibiting them from holding any
office in any Student Association
organization or any position
board level or above. The only
restriction which would remain
is that no Justice may be amem-
ber of MYSKANIA or Central
Council.

The motion for tabling the bill
was made in order that the mea-
sure could be discussed at the
closed session held this week to
evaluate the operation of the
government and because, report-
edly, MYSKANlA is considering
proposing a bill which would con-
vert MYSKANIA itself into the
supreme judiciary of Student
Association.

,The' election bill referred to
Election Commission was pre-
sented by Terry Mathias, as an
answer to a measure passed by
Central Council the week before
which called for revision in the
election procedure. On a motion
by James Kahn, one of the mem-

bers of the ElectionCommission,
the bill was referred to the Else,
tion Commission. .

Kahn felt this should be done
in order that the commission
could study the bill in depth.
When making the motion, Kahn
noted some of the unclear por-
tions of the bill and other parts
which were not written in enough
depth. .

The Cabinet of the Student
Association presented a bill to
Central Council designed "toim-
prove the communications within
the student organization." The
bill, which would have required
the ASP to print certain notices,
was amended and passed by the
Council. .

The amendment was so stated
as to exclude all requirements
made which would have forced
the ASP to print all policy state-
ments and notices which Central
Council or any Commission
thought would be of essential
interest to the student body.

The bill, passed as amended
provided for the exchange of
minutes between all commis-
sions and Central Council. These
minutes will also be posted in
each residence area.
