Faculty, Students

Discuss Issues
,At Black Eye

For the purpose of self-ex-
pression, the men ofstuyveeant
Tower each week host "Black
Eye" discussions.

It was originated so that the
student body would have achance
to share their views on a va-
riety of subjects with members
of the faculty.

Future discussions will take
place on such topics as "What
is a university?” (Nov. 16) and
"Hippies: Revolutionary or Rs-
volting?" (Dec. 7).

Last“week's discussion was:

' "Drugs: Breakthrough or Break-

down?" A number of major points
were brought up by both students
and faculty.

How often does marijuana lead
to heroin? is marijuana destruc-
tive mentally or physically in it-
self? what are the penalties for
the use and possession of the
drug? Will making marijuana il-
legal after study have an ef-
fect on its use? Is it addicting
or habit forming?

These questions were brought
up and discussed by students
who have experienced the drug
and by those who have not taken
the drug but question its use.

The group meets in the low-
er lounge of Stuyvesant Tower
Thursday evenings at 9:00 p.m.

Disciplines Talk

“information In the Disci-
plines" will present a program
in Romance Languages and one
in Political Science next week.

gram will be held on Monday,

in Humanities 35-1. Discussion

lowship opportunities, cursor and
graduate information and for-
eign study programs.

Political Science, Tuesday, No-
vember 14, 1067 at 3:00 p.m. In

of the political science major,
related graduate education (pub-
lic administration, law, and po-
litical science), and related pro-
fessional and vocational oppor-
tunities.

IF G Film to be Shown
Tonight atDrapcrHall

The third film in Satajlt Ray’s
acclaimed “Apu” Trilogy, “The
World of Apu,” in tonight's ln-
ternational Film Group presen-
tation.

The film is one of the few
from india ( the most cinemat-
ically prolific country in the
world) that has been “ ed

gizes for the abortive affair of
"81/2" last weekend. It was not
the group's fault, however; the
distributor accidentally cancel-
led the film and rented it else-
where. Nevertheless the iF‘G is
sorry for the inconvenience which
may have been caused.

by Jane lt’lchlin
An unprecedented number a
University students did not pay
student tax this year. The S,-
413 students who did pay student
Tax as of Sept. 30, and those
who have paid since then, com-
prise just over 50 per cent of

all University students. ‘
0f prime concern to student

' Association officers is the mark-

ed gsp between the projected bud-
get for the 1987-08 year, and the
revenue from the students pay-
ing tax.

Paul Downes, vice president
of student Association, feels that
there is a real need for a "thor-
ough" tax policy, to counteract
this trend.

"A 'thorough' tax policy, in
my opinion must explain the pew-
ers of the Student Tax Commit-
tee, and delineate the procedures
for organizations to follow when
distributing materials or serv-
ices financed in whole or in part
by Student Association,” Downes
explained. .

The problems of student gov-
ernments with Student Tax
throughout the State University
System was examined Friday,
Oct. 27, in a meeting of Chan-
cellor Gould and all student As-
sociation Presidents.

Gould stated that the individual
student governments within the
system were prohibited from
mandating Student Tax. Further-
more, the move to make the tax
compulsory would be infeasible
for the State University of New
York Trustees as well. If the

latter measure was taken, the

money would have to be placed

 

_a masterpiece.

The story tells of the young
writer of Apu's Bohemian days
in Calcutta, his surprise mar-
riage, the tribulations of parent-
hood and his struggles with his
art.

l'One of the great human monu-
ments of the cinema," was one
critic's reaction to this extra-
ordinary film.

“The World of Ann" will be
shown Friday in Draper 349 at
7:00 and 9:15. Admission is $.25
with student tax, $.40 without.

Dissent Panel

The Golden Eye will present
a discussion on the dissenters

entitled “How Far Protest?" The
discussion will be focused on the
proper and moral plan of actions

The panel will be composed of
members favoring the protests
of the doves and those denying
the desirability and validity of
the antiwar protests. Professor
Johnson of the Education Depart-
ment and Richard Evans, who
attended the Washington March,
will be sympathetic to the pro-
testors. Dr. Overbeck of the
