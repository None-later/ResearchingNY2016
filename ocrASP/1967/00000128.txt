At his Weekly eminence with
students held Monday, President
Evan R. Collins ruined his posi-
tion on the right of dissent for
all. members cl the University
community.

. He spoke specifically of the
dissent. exhibited by students
who protested the masses d

' a CIA recruiter on campus last

Thursday.

1n general Collins felt that
the way. a University community
handles its methods of dissent is
a measure (I the maturity d
the community itself.

Collins praised the method 11
dissent employed by the stu-
dents who handed out leaflets
stating their case against the
CIA during the morning, but ex-
pressed disappolntment, at the
lack d maturity exhibited at
a demonstration later in the day.

Of the morning action Collins
stated that although he did not
completely agree with the opin-
ions expressad in the leaﬂets
which were drawn up by the Com-
mittee to End the War and sns,
be upheld absolutely the demon-
strators' rights to distribute
them since they at no time via-

all? r:1ao stated that he felt
the leaﬂets to be lucid, clear
and resealable in Presenting
their ideas.

Because 11 “:13‘ dignity .vtr‘ltlh
which the m min -
tion was carried out Collinsstat-
ed that "It was with genuine
pride, and a pleasure that my
couldence In the, student body
was Justified."

However Collins condemned
the later demonstration actions
of the day because the students
participating were trying toforce
their own edicts by denying the
right of free expression to oth-
ers. '

The action occurred when stu-
dents forced their way into the
CIA recruiting room where
the interviews were being held.
The demonstrators sat down and
held up interviewing.

Collins stated that "Dissen-
ters, than, have aspecial respon-
sibllity that they preserve for
others the same freedom they

Care Center

For Welfare Families

me 'Albang Liberator’

The Brothers hope to initiate
Albany’s first day care center for
Welfare families later this year.
Negotiations are underway for
the use of the facilities of an
Albany church which would al-
low as many as 40 children be-
tween the ages of 3 and 8 to

1' receive head - start instruction

while their mothers attend lob
training and - orvocatfonal train-
ing courses.

The day care center would have
two main purposes. It would allow
women to receive training which
would then give them the chance
to find a job and become self-

At the present time under New

York State law the Welfare De-
partment offers 815 a‘week per
child to a mother for day care
expenses. There are no day care
centers in Albany that take care
:1 children for that amount a
money.

The second purpose would be
to precondition the children for
schooling. Working with several
experts in the education field,
including Mr. Jack Ether of the
New York state University, the
Brothers hope to provide an edu-
cational program that will break
down what Leon Van Dyke calls
"the disadVantagc d the slum
children."

Van, Dyke says that most ghetto
children enter school from V2
to a year behind and by the time
they reach high school they are
three or four years behind.

The day care center would be
open to any Welfare recipients,
black or white, and would fol-
low the state guidelines for such
centers such as providing hot
lunches, an afternoon nap and
"trained or experienced" sup-
ervisors. -

The Brothers hope that wel-

fare mothers. will themselves
help run the day care center,
includlng having representation
on the bond of directors of
the center. The basis for the
center comes from the Wel-
fare Union of Albany which has
worked on behalf of welfare re-
clplents and handled complaints
and problems for its members.
A person need only be on wel-
fare to Join the union — there
is no fee, norobligatfons. Women
who would like to work in the day
care center will receive training.
But any woman who has chil-
dren at least three years old
would be able to have her chil-
dren cared for while she attends
classes for a high school equiva-
lency degree or for a particular
job training program as run by
the Manpower Training Center,
the New York State Urban Cen-
ter, or the Board of Education.
Women interested in this pro-
gram may contact Loon Van Dyke
at the Brothers' office, 170 North
Pearl St., or call 485-8347. it
is now known at the present time
when the center will start, but
further information will be ap-
pearing 1n the Liberator.

verslty more than 1,000 per-

To Have New Site

The large Victorian structure
which houses Dudley Observatory
will be coming down. The ob-
servatory on South Lake Street
in Albany will be razed to make
way for a mental hospital.

Dudley Observatory, Albany
Law School, Albany Pharmacy,
Albany Medch School and Union
College are all independent
branches of Union University.
These institutions are loosely
bound to each other in the uni-
verslty. The Presldent of Union
College also serves as President
of Union University.

The property Dudley ls pre-
sently situated on was sold last
year to Albany Medical Center.
The medical center then sold the
property to the State of New
York. Dudley is planning to
move to a building at 100 Fuller
Road to set up their operatlons.

At the present time 100 Fuller
Road also houses the Univer-
sity's Astronomy and Atmo-
spheric Science Departments. In
effect then Dudley will have al-
campus later
this year.

President Evan R. Colllns stat-
ed at a recent conference with
students that the University is
willing to offer Dudley a per-
manent site on campus on which
it may build a new observatory.

The selection of such a site,
whether the site be on the campus
or not, will be made by the board
of trustees of Dudley Observa-
tory. Since Dudley is a part of
Union University the President
of Union College is a member of
the Board of Trustees. Collins
also sits on the board since
both universltles cooperate in
the operation of Dudley.

A "unique situation” would

result if Dudley is permanently

moved to the Universlty's camp- /

us. In effect a part of one uni.-
versity would be housed on
another's campus. .

lt is felt' that such a situation
would not prove awkward since
the scientists at Dudley hold
professional positions at both
the University and UnlonCollege.
Dr. Curtls Hsmcnway, director
of Dudley, is also the head of
the University's Astronomy De-
partment.

Dudley Observatory was con-
ceived in 1854 when the first
structure was built in Dudley
Park. The observatory, was fi-
nanced by a bequest of a nine-
teenth century Albany politician.

During the first half of Dud-
ley's history the mom task ofthe
astronomers was to trace the
path of the stars. Today the
scientists at Dudley are noted
for their work with dust particles
from outer space.

Dudley has become famous
throughout the world for Its work
with these micrometeorites. The
observatory is working in this
field in conjunction with
scientists from NASA as well
as from foreign countrles.

Dudley has been cooperating
with the space program in the
collection of the dust particles.
The space capsules, rockets, and
balloons whlch have been sent
up to outerspace have carried
devices for collecting the
particles.

Dudley has several very high
powered electron microscopes at
its disposal to study these part-
icles. To weight the micrometeo-
rites Harvey Patashnick, agradu-
ate student, has invented aextra-
sensitive scale.

DUDLEY OBSERVATORY ls soon to move to a new site from Its downtown location.

FACADE 1‘0 DUDLEY where research ls presently being

done on space particles.

Patashnick, Physics Student

Achieves Science Acclaim

by Ed witnstck

Harvey Patashnlck,a first year
graduate student in the Univer-
slty’s Physics Department is cur-
rently continuing research on a
micro-balance which he devel-
oped last year. This scale, soon
to be called Patashnlck-Hem-
enway Scale, enables tiny cosmic
particles of dust to be weighed.

Patashnlck, 21 years old, on-
tered the University as a fresh-
man in 1968 and began working
at the Dudley Observatory as
a laboratory assistant.

His first major research Was
with a group working to develop
a means by which meteors could
be counted through use of radio
wavos.

By his junior your Putnshnlck
was offered a National Science
Foundation Grant to do research
in the field of Physics. Potash-
nick accepted the grant, and to-
gether with funds from the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration and advice from Dr.
Curtls llemenway, the director of
the Dudley ObsorVatory, he de-
veloped the micro balance.

In 1886 when "Fireball" pass-
ed over North America,Patash-
nick and Charles Bowman, a
fellow student, were sent totrack

down.

This gained much publicity for
those two students of science who
were first to determine the
atmospheric path of "Fireball."
They later appeared on the Hunt-
ley-Brlnklay News and explain-
ed the meteorite and its path.

Patashnlck's micro-balance has
also brought him and the Univer-
alty wldo acclaim. In July of
1988 Pataahntckprosested a paper -

to the American National Aero-
nautical Society at Cornell, and
in November of 1988 he submit-
ted another to "16 American
Meteorltical Society 2. . lheSmith-
sonoan institute.

Currently Patashnlcl. is working
to make his scale more sensi-
tive. However, NASA is al-
ready adapting the scale for use
in their space program since
it is one of the few instruments
whlch can measure mlnute cos-
mic dust. The slcale can also
measure magnetic properties of
small particles.

Patashnlck said the balance will
be of even greater assistance to
Biologists and Chemists who need
it to weigh cells and other struc-
tures.

New Accelerator
Tool of Research
On Low Energy

by sandy Porter

An accelerator, one ofthe first
of its kind in the United states,
will be housed in the basementof
the University's new Plan 1-
um. This Dynamltron, sch ed
for installation in 1989, will be
among the University's special
instrumentation for research in
low energy nuclear physics.

The accelerator based on ade-
sign by Radiation Dynamttrons
Inc. is capable of producinghlgh-
er currents than the Vandergraffv
accelerator. It can exert energies
up to four million volts, making
possible the study of certain nu-
clear phemomcna unable to be
studled before.

The accelerator will be used
to study the fundamental pro-
perties of nucleilby investigating
the nuclear structureofthe atom.
In, attempting to understand the
properties of matter, the physic-
ists will try to grasp the basic
laws governing the atom and the
forces binding them together.

The accelerator will be used
for purely fundamental research
by faculty and graduate students
under the directlon of Dr. Jags.-
dlsh Garg. The faculty working
with the accelerator will include
Drs. Garg, Raymond E. Banan-
son, Richard I. Brown, Bento-
mln E. Chl, Bruce B, March
and Jack H. Smith.

lnterest in interdisciplinary
areas opens the research to bio-
logists, blochemfsts, biophysic-
lsts and others who can profit
from the use ofsuch an apparatus
as the accelerator.

Research may be made intothc
radation damages,
damages in metals and other
areas in whlch the knowledge
and understanding of the nuclear
structure ls basic.

Both on-campus and off-campus
computer facilities will be used
for data analysis and theoretical
studies. The research with the
accelerator will make extensive
use of the Computlng Science
Department of the University.

The Physics department
through its graduate programs
hopes to attract at least a dozen
students within the next five years
who are interested in programs
catering to an understanding of
the fundamental structure of
matter. Collaboration from
neighboring institutions in the
Trl-City area is anticipated.

At present the accelerator and
research will be supwrtadby the
University. however, it is hoped
federal and private support may
eventually be obtained from 1n-
stltutlons such as the Atomic

Enerry Commission and the Nu. ..  ».
