Master Plan Guide
To Future U. Growth

by Carl Lindeman

The future State University’s
pr0posed 1968 Master Plan'and
the annual' Progress Reports
were subjects discussed at last
Monday's Press Conference by
President Evan R. Collins.

The revised 1964 Master Plan
and the Progress report are de-
signed by the Trustees of the
state University of New York
with the purpose of recommend-
ing modifications in the State
University's Master Plan and
providing a guide for future grow-

, th within the State University

system.

The Master Plan and the Pro-
gress report are derived through
a series of reports given by the
President of each university. In
formulating this report he re-
ceives information regarding his
respective university from his
subordinates and other peeple
connected with university life.

His report, along with the re-
ports of all other State Univer-
sity institutes, is sent to Samuel
B. Gould, Chancellor oi the State
University oi New York.

Gould will then examine each
report and compile the Master
Plan and the Progress Report,
which is sent to Governor Nelson
A. Rockefeller and to the Board
oi Regents oi the State of New
York. In addition to these reports
Chancellor Gould also includes
those reports submitted by all
other universities and colleges
within the State.

Another report on the future
growth of the University system
is also compiled by the Board of

Free University
To Consider
Political Groups

The next open discussion inthe
free university model " Experi-
mental Seminar" under the di-
rection of University student Lou
Strong will take place Wednesday
at 7:30 p.m. in the alcoves above
the cafeteria in the Campus Cen-

ter.

Discussion will center Specifi-
cally on "A View into Polticial
Pressure Groups in other Counn
tires" and comparison oiAmeri-
can Student pressure groups with
those in foreign countries.

Several of the University's
foreign students will comment
and discuss this situation as it
applies to their particular counu
tries.

Regents. The ’68 plan goes into
effect next year with the projec-
tion of its scope up to 1972. How-
ever, each year the Master plan
is revised.

A major proposal was the ex-
pansion of the entire University
library service. Included in the
recommendation was the pro-
vision to facilitate "the planning
of facilities and acquisitions as
follows: University Centers:
2,000,000 holdings; University
College: 500,000 holdings; Agri-
cultural and Technical Colleges:
150,000 holdings; Community
Colleges: 100,000 holdings;
Others: To be determined."

Also included in the proposal
was the establishment of a central
library service facility and a
state-wide library communica.
tions network.

In the field of dramatics itwas
proposed that the University
"select performing artists in
theater, dance and music to affili-
ate with the University. . .”

The revised plan also set forth
projected physical growth for the
University system. it recom-.
mended in accordance with the
recom mendation of the Governor.
that the University system estab-
lish Urban Centers of vocational
training located in Buffalo, the
Capitol District, Syracuse, Utica,
New York City, Rochester and
Yonkers.

included within the scape of
physical growth is the establish-
ment of a new college stressing
sciences and technology in the
Herkimer - Rome - Utica area.
Other major proposals were as
follows: (1) University Centers
join University Colleges in pro-
viding advanced technical occupa-
tional curricula (2) The conver-
sion from teacher training in-
stitutions to colleges of arts and
sciences be continued (3) That
college-level courses be offered
to the people of the State via
educational television. The name
of this program will be called
the “University of the Air.’ (4)
The establishment oi easy transi-
tion from Baccalaureate and
Master's degree work at the col-
leges to doctoral programs at the
University centers.

The entire scope of the Master
Plans is best expressed in the
words of the Forward to the Re-
vised 1964 plan:

it. . . the Trustees repeatedly
have stressed their conviction
that the University can attain
excellence only if it imbued with
a sense of identity and unity."

A cursory survey was enough
to assure me oi a tremendous
amount at misinformation"rear-

.ing its ugly head" in our academic

community. Over a mucousy
attempt at sunny-stumps pourle
petit dejeuner, i committed the.
tragic mistake of probilg my
peers concerning the nature, a
the Free University. The re-
sponses ranged from: “Isn't
that some new bill they're trying
to put through Congress so we
won't have to pay for “the best
years of our lives?" toi'Oh, wow,
you mean like in the liar-rad
Experiment?"

And so i will bring it upon
myseli to enlighten the "heath-
ens" in a subject diormidable
(it not downright tremendous)
dimensions. The Free University
is just about the most exciting
thing that's happenedtoeducation
since Guttenburg’s invention. it
is a kind of be-in adaption of the
Hippie's ideals, and even
criticism of the movement can-
not delete its constructive critic-
ism oi current shortcomings.

Developed within the confines
of an already existing institution,
the Free University eases the
tensions and frustrations which
are inescapable on the ever-ex-
panding campus. Many students
complain that their undergradu-
ate learning process is better
enriched by symposiums, semi-
nars, and colloquiums thanbyihe
actual classroom experience.

The unrestrained and brutal
use oi police to disperse campus
demonstration may be the cause
of the most serious crisis higher
education has faced in this cen-
tury, according to Ed Schwartz,
president of the National Student
Association.

Schwartz predicted this week
that at least 25 major protests
will be held this year on college
campuses across the country, and
he warned college administrators
against calling the cops.

NSA will "support and assist
student strikes growing out of
the unwarranted use of police to
bludgeon student demonstrat-
ors," Schwartz said.

His remarks came in the wake
of major student strikes at the,
University of Wisconsin and
Brooklyn College. In both cases,
the strikes were called after
police were ordered onto the
campuses to break up student
demonstrators. Police alsobroke
up a demonstration at Princeton
University this week.

The initial demonstrations at
Wisconsin and Brooklyn which
brought in the police were again-
st unpopular campus recruiters.
"lniormation we have received
during the past few days indicates
protests against campus recruit;
ers will not end with Brooklyn
and Wisconsin — they will
spread," Schwartz said.

"The reckless use of police
on campuses last weekhas mere-
ly highlighted the lack ofconcern
that administrators feel toward
students and has lent new urgency
for our drive to encourage student

ower on campuses," he added.

He predicted that a confronta-
tion between Central Intelligence
Agency recruiters and demon-
strators may occur at Brandis
between now and mid-November.
He also mentioned Fordham, Chl-
cago, Columbia, Michigan, Wayne
State, the City College of New
York, and Oberlin as institutions
where major student protests
may take place.

Schwartz announced NSA is
sending a list of guidelines to
student governments across the
country to be used when con-

they have hum tor those who
may object to that phrase on the
grmnda that it is discarded at

Emerging from the Berkeley
Revolt, the Civil Rights "Free-
dom Schools," and the Vietnam
"Teach-ins," experimental col-
leges originated in the tenor of
the New Left, and were basically
cwnter-university.' They have
evolved into a desire by both
students and faculty _to learn and
instruct in a free atmosphere.
The beauty of the idea is that it
excludes none: entrance require-
ments have been discarded, and
the most successhrl ventures to
date have united students, ad-
ministrators, and townspeople.
A new catalogue from Dartmouth
opens with the inspiring words:
"innovation will be the rule;
free give and take will be the
method; a provooative education-
al experience will be the goal.”

Not only have the Free Univer-
sity experiments created a new
learning environment in which
students can no longer act as
passive members, echoing re-
frains oi "Here I am, teach me,
and make it fun," but they also
focusing on more relevent topics.
Courses range from "Analogues
to the LSD Experience" and"The
Philosophical Ramificationa of
Modern Drama” to “Electric
Ecstasy Laboratory." Student-
iaculty relationships have grown
from inadequate to excellent.

campuses. Demonstrations reach
serious proportions “because
student government leaders fre-
quently fail to play a creative
role before the incidents occur,"
he said. He emphasized that NSA
does not support attempts to
block students from attending
job interviews, ior example, but
" this does not mean that student
leaders should sit on their hands
until a group of students is beaten
by police.

NSA will assist student govern-
ments to insure that they obtain
a voice over policies affecting
recruiters and that they exercise
a constructive role during the
demonstrations themselves, Sch-
wartz said.

He announced that NSA will
sponsor a national student con-

The end product of thisrevoiu-

not only to recognise problems,
but to deal with them in anavant-

the college campus in 1967, and
finished onarather damning note:
“. . . most of them goquietly
about the job of advancing their
education, while the minority of
rebels, deviants, and Moon-
tents in their midst get the head-
lines." I believe that this valu-
able minority composes the core
of that which is essential in an
otherwise stagnant situation.
What is needed is a sincere ges-
ture to wipe off a complacent
grin and replace it with a fresh,
daring outlook.

will be a planning session for
direct campus action.

The guidelines being sent to
student governments were .' .

bers. The guidelines "are not
policy decisions and are not man-
datory; they are just advice on
tactics, Schwartz said.

Although Schwartz spoke main-
ly of campus demonstrations
against recruiters, he said the
same policies about police inva-
sion of campuses would apply to
protests against classified re-
search. "We are not concerning
ourselves to much with what the
demonstrations are for or
