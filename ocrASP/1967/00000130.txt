, inet,

 

Last week Central Council tabled a
proposed amendment to the Student As-
sociation Constitution providing for im-
mediate action to be taken in amending
the Student Association Constitution to
allow reappointment of Supreme Court
Justices.

However. the Council, which had oth-
er ideas about the importance of rein-
stating the Supreme Court to its Consti-
tutional position by immediate action,
voted to consider for two more weeks
what should be done and tabled the mo-
tion. ‘

The supposed reasoning behind this
move was that they might as well hold
off action pending an evaluation ses-
sion which was to. be held last night.

The evaluation session, which was
to consist of Central Council, the Cab-
and MYSKANIA would evaluate,
among other things, the whole ques-
tion of the Supreme Court and the pos-
sibilities of MYSKANIA assuming judi-
cial capacities.

Whether or not anthing concrete can
come of the meeting remains to be
seen, but if nothing does we still will
not have any judiciary for the next
few weeks.

Frankly we doubt anything will come
of it; we haven't been too Impressed
with MYSKANIA's progress so far.After
five weeks MYSKANIA is still meeting
once a week; no rough draft has been
presented and it appears some mem-
bers are having second thoughts on the
matter.

In the event MYSKANIA really tal-
lies with a concrete statement and a
rationale for the move; we still could
not support the immediate assumption
of judicial capacities by the ’67
MYSKANIA, because they were not
elected to serve in judiciary capacity.
Even if a plan is formulated and a ref-
erendum held to leaglize it we must
still wait for the ’68 MYSKANIA be.
fore legally instituting the policy. In
the meantime where is a judiciary?

it appears the Council doesn't have
enough respect for its Constitution to
uphold it; the Constitution states by
intent that there be a judiciary body.

Courting Disaster

  

By the way Supreme Court, you may
be powerless but you could still lobby
‘for your cause. Enough said.

Big Deal

st Thursday s demonstration in pro-
test of the arrival of the CIA on campus
raises the question of what was accom-
plished by this mildly disruptive act.

   
   

By forcefully obstructing the peaceful
and legal interviewing process by stag-
ing a sit-in in the interviewer's office
all that was accomplished was a viola-
tion of the right to freedom of expression
which should be granted to any agency.
It also encroached upon the rights of a
student wishing to obtain information
about any group which he desires to
support.

The demonstrators' apparent mo-
tives were to convey their mistrust
of the CIA both to the rest of the Uni-
versity community and to the CIA them-
selves. They seemed to think that by
scaring the CIA man away from his of-
fice they could make the CIA disappear
or something.

However, by their mode of operation
they contradicted their own supposed
beliefs. While condemning the oppres-
sive methods of the CIA which over-
rides their rights, they saw fit to over-
ride the rights of others. in effect
they became the oppressors of the rights
they claim to uphold.

We never were able to get too excit-
ed about the forceful obstruction of
recruiting tables in this manner a la
Berkeley. To our mind a recruiting
table is an unforceful thing, and no one
has to go, they seldom corrupt the un-
wary.

It seems the students were really as.
serting a wish to determine policy on
who may be allowed to recruit on cam-
pus. As far as we are concerned there
is no issue. There would be an issue
only if selection were being used by the
placement service (who books the re-
cruiters here) to selectively eliminate,
recruiters they felt were an inimicable
force on students.

li students want control over recruit-
ing procedure it should be only to in-
sure complete freedom for all who wish
to recruit.

 

Let me illustrate. Consider
two hypothetical : one
is a fraternity member living
on campus and workiu for the
ASP and the other is an inde-
pendent living off campus and

We have heard And seen many
complaints concerning the ASP
in its present form. The general
consensus of opinion seems tabs
that the ASP has become a trite
paper run by a group of hippies
who publish many articles which
are offensive to the University
community as a whole.

As for myself, I too have found
certain aspects of this paper to
be unsatisfactory in that its
general views differ from my
own. Many times I find myself to
be the only staff writer to dis-
agree on prominent issues. This,
however, I do not deem to be a
significant reason to condemn
the ASP in general.

in past years, the ASP and
its predecessor, the College
News, have been primarily con-
cerned with events which occur
on the campus itself. Although
these reports are a necessary
part of any college newspaper, it
would seem that there may be
some things in the outside world
which could pertain tothe college
student.

As it has fanned out, though,
the new system is justu prone
to orgies of trivia as the old.
Because the election districts
on campus are physically com.

to be elected on the basis of
their local popularity or their
position in a local pecking or.

It is true that the ASP has
become much more controversial
than in the past, but is con-
troversy so undesirable that We
should reject another person's

condemn the editorial staff ofthe
ASP for printing their beliefs.
Because their thinking may be
more radical than my own does
not give me an apt reason to
completely reject anything which
they might say. Those who man-
age the ASP should be commend-
ed for their faith in what they
print, even if their views arouse
much controversy. I believe the
ASP, in its present form, to be a
vast improvement over its pre-
decessors. Even though its views
and policies may not be accept-
ed by all, they are read by all.
Whether we like the material
printed in the ASP, or we detest
it, we must admit that the ASP
is promoting thinking among
minds which could otherwise be-

nuns got I thus hot for the
CIA recruiter last Wednesday.
in fact, you might say the re-

' - cruiter blew his cool.

The day started outssifonly
a milk reception hadbeen organi-
ised for the veteran of a battle
last Sprhg at Columbia Univer-
sity and‘a skirmish last month
at Williams College.

Students going to their morn-
ing classes were greeted with
leaflets criticizing the activities
and the very nature of the
organisation.

The leaﬂets cited several,
activities in which the CIA has
been involved and then raised
the question whether these actile
ties and their methods couldbe
reconciled with the ideasndtradi-
tions of a "free society."

While classes were insession,
the students sat inside the educa-
tion building on the 3rd floor out-

- side the door of the interviewer.

When a student would leave the

interview room, the interviewer, ’

a short man with glasses, would
stand in the‘doorway with a cold,
stern look on his face.

The protesters handed him a
leaﬂet. He later said he had no
comments on it.

Several students who were in-
terested in asking questions about
the CIA's activities signed up for
interviews. Usually they were
asked to leave when they didn't
ask the right questions.

By noon the recruiter was be-
hind schedule. Students in the
corridor talked to those going
to and from interviews. When
the interviewer came out of the
room at noon and hurried down
the hall, there was a spontaneous
burst of laughter and applause.

The protectors reassembled
on the third floor early in the
afternoon. All during the entire
day faculty and other people com-
mented on the signs, asked for

'_ 2"j'lyi’alnriicip‘ants 1'

copies of the handout sheets, or

a made remarks as they passed by

the protesters. M supported
what the students ﬁe doing and
they said so. Only a few seemed
to feel that sitting in a corridor
was illegitimate.

'Around 1:45 the group decided
at someone's suggestion to con-
front the CIA with questions.
They knocked on the door.

“You're not going to force

your way in here," the CIA man .

said when he opened the door.
"You can't come in here. This
is my room."

"This is our school,” the stu-
dents answered.

One boy politely asked if they
could ask questions. The CIA
man tried to shut the door, but
20 students were already in the
room. ,

The recruiter then rushed over
to his briefcase, slammed it shut
and ran out of the room. The
students did not attempt to stop
him, but they went down to the
first floor and met him as he
came out of the elevator.

The CIA man hurried into the
placement office. The students
continued their protest, sitting
down in the corridor outside.

Two campus security police
stood guard on each side of the
door to the placement office. The
two guards paced the corridor
nervously. One of them said,
" This make me look bad." Later
the recruiter was escorted off
to interviews at the Graduate
School of Public Affairs.

Later one of the protesters
was asked if the group had not
interferred with the freedom of
the recruiter. “The CIA stands
for subversion, for the use of any
and all methods to accomplish
their goals," he replied. "How
can you say we interferred with
their freedom," the protesters
asked his questioner, "when the
CIA has compromised ours."

Drug addiction knows no boun-
daries. "Not a single neighbor-
hood (today) ls devoid of addic-
tion although incidence may
vary," said Dr. Efren Ramirez,
coordinator of New York City's
narcotics addiction programs.

At least loo areas in the city
have serious addiction problems,
he said, even though many be-
lieve it is limited to certain
areas like Greenwich Village or
Needle Park.

"Practically every citizen is
affected by drugs in this city."
People in general are involved
because they know addicts (rela-
tives, friends) or have seen the
effects of the use of drugs.

With 40,000 known users of
heroin and perhaps 100,000 more,
the problem cannot be attributed
to one cause. Few users are psy-
chotlcs, said Ramirez, but all
of them have personality distur-
bances. “They all have one thing
in common: "theytend to alienate
themselves."

Many persons in New Yorkllve
in slngle-room-occupancy build-
ings, "and because they are iso-
lated they turn to drugs."

Solutions?

Hospital programs were found
to be unsuccessful because
“those trying to kick the habit
use has itals as revolving
doors." Many enter a hospital
voluntarily but only to reduce
the amount —- of the drug — they
are used to taking; upon leaving
the hospital they resume drug
taking at a lower monetary rate
and re-work their way up to
higher, more expansive doses.)

A program whereby addicts
may be aided by former drus
addicts might be successful.

Another idea is double-occupancy

rooms for addicts which would
facilitate discussion of their
problems. v
Long Island

On Long Island sixteen persons
were arraigned on felony charges
of selling narcotics In Suffolk
County diners, gas stations and
other hangouts.

These heroin users and sup-
pliers were getting "top dollar"
by supplying perhaps 100 other
addicts in the area. Police, look-
ing for other suspects, identified
the source of the drugs as New
York City (contacts).

"Small amounts of heroin,
marijuana and ampheiimlnewore
reported confiscated from the
suspects who allegedly dealtalso
in LSD.’l

Connecticut

In Connecticut an investigation
of a high school narcotics scandal
resulted in the arrest of three
persons on narcotics charges.
One had supplied methedrine
sugar cubes on the school parking
lot. The others were arrested
for the sale and possession of
marijuana.

This was the first time speed
is known to have been used in
Westport. Glue sniffing and mari-
juana cases had come up before,
said Lieutenant Marks.

Penn T. Kimball, a Columbia
University journalism professor
running as a candidate for the
Wostport school board said,
“drug taking by toen-agers has
nothing to do with character. It's
a symptom of malaise, asadness
sweeping the country.”

The present drug scene is be-
ginning to hit many parents
literally at home. They are start-
ing to realize the necessity of
educating themselves in order to
be of constructive help to their
children who have gone on LSD
trips, who are addicted toheroin, .
and who escape to New York
slums in an effort to assert their
independence and fulfill their
curiosity.

junior in 1960 and spent my
term working with Mexican-
American in Eaton, New Mexico,
a small town in the southern
Rockies just south of the Colo-
rado border. The work I did was
varied: I helped organize a com-
munity association; ltutored kids
in typing; i drove a school bus
for our Headstart project and I
did construction work on aneigh-

the year's work enjoyable.
Whether I accomplished some-
thing is another story. I really
can't say.

We been asked several times
(by students here) if I thought
VISTA was worthwhile. l have
told them yes, but have qualified
myself. VISTA, as an idea, is
quite a worthy thing. How it
works out in practice is the real
test; every VISTA project is in-
dividual and has to he judgedthat
way. VISTA is to the particular
project what University Study is
to one's particular schedule. So
much depends onwhere the volun-

run by conservative high school
principle types, and as you may
expect, these projects are
generally Mickey Mouse wastes

projects with sharp, interested

LIB/L‘IM TION News Service

The gala Pentagon Confronts:-
tion, long billed as a move from
"protest to resistance," was a
dramatic and intense political
event. Many had been dubious;
few can now deny that a new
stage is upon us.

Many feel that the now left
has become relevant to the black
movement. At apress conference
for the establishment media, John
Wilson, associate national chair-
man of SNCC, said:"This demon-
stration proved one thing towhlte
Americans — that this govern-
ment will whip you, too. During
this anti-draft week, at Oakland,
at Madison, at Brooklyn, at Wash-
ington — Black America has
gained new respect for the white
left. There are going to be drama.-
tlc changes in the movement.”

Certainly the most significant
aspect of the confrontation at
Washington was the spontaneous
way in which the demonstrators
began to relate to the soldiers.
And the remarkable occurrence
of two, possme thraeGI'sthrow-
ing down their weapons and da-
fecting to the side of the demon-
strators.

The confrontation itself creat-
ed a dynamic spirit of commun-
ity. The actual storming of the
Pentagon was something few had
really expected. So there was
no pro-established structure to
deal with the situation; people
had to use their heads and work
together.

The confrontation went throngh
two distinct phases. The first
was a period of strength and
vitality. Paoplewsre on the move.
They related to each other in
very real ways. Therewcrethou-
sands of peoplejammed together,

The second phase ofthedamon-
stration was pretty much a bad
scene. And I'm not sure why.
For one thing, they kept changing
the troops. Whenever we'd start
really talking to guys, they'd
move them out. Maybe they finally
brought in their "crack" troops.
Lots of people left. It got darksnd

CHAPTER THREE: IN WHICH SERGEANT FRIDAY BE-
COMES SERGEANT PEPPER

l was walking back from class
the other day, whenl happened
to espy one of our campus gum-
shoes (rent-a-cop) in the pur-
suance of his duty. He had a
little pad of yellow tickets and
what he was doing was pretty
obvious, but my innate curiosity
drove me on.

“What're doing?" Idumbques-
timed him.

"Well, l'm doin’ my thing, man,"
he answered.

“what?”

"My thing, you know."

I had a pretty good idea, but
the same force that, makes you
touch an already. sore cold sore
forced me to make further in
quirles.

" Well, lust what is your thing,"
I wanted to know.

" Well, its's like this man. This
cat's been parking his car in this
here place where it's not
supposed to be at. And he's gettln'
me all up tight with this ticket

writing thing. Like it's not really
my bag this ticket thing."

"Your bmu

"Yeah, man. Like I'm strictly
one of those night stick twirlcrs
and whistle blowers."

l was secretly wondering how
one of SUNYA's finest could have
come to such a sorry pass, but

Badge 00000 seemed to be onto
me already.

“Hey, I'm gettin’ these good
vibrations from you man, and
l’m goin’ to let you in on a little
secret."

"Whatever can it be?" I want-
ed to blurt out; but he was too
quick for me.

“Hey.” he said for the second
time, "what do you thinkbappens
to any stuff the cops cstpure in'
a Bust?” The thought never
crossed my mind andl told him
so. "Well," he began, and then
looked around to check if anyone
was listening, "what we do is.."
here he stopped short and drew
himself up to his full height,
raised his night stick meanacing-
ly, and said "Are on anarco?
I've half a mind,” and I'm sure
that's all it was) “to turn you
over to SDS."

1 assured him I was not.

“Well, after a Bust, the cops
have a party, you know. We
smoke." 'He giggled with an ill
concealed glee. I nodded know-

ingly.

"I gotta get back on the job,"
he said. "It's a drag and one day
l'm gonna freak out in the Dutch
Quad parking" lot, but right now
it keeps me in Zlg-Zags."

It’s enough to make a strong
man cry.
