interesting songs, good arrange-
ments, and some cleverly written
times which show not only writ-
ing talent but also a sensitivity
with lyrics.

"Wasn't it a Bit like Now
(Parallel '23)" is humorous be-
' cause it shows a closer relation-
ship between mini-skirts oitoday
and styles oi the 1920's than
several people would like to
admit. This relationship is em-
phasised by the middle part oi
the sou which shiits irom a
“Twentyish” rock style toahard
zoo: modern sound and then
so

“On a Quiet Night" has a
sensitivity in its images which
makes it more than crock-ami-
roll tune. The background suits
the words, and sets a quieter
mood than you would expectirom
the rock sound, and it contributes
to the ieeling oi a_quiet night.

"Windy," oi course, is one of
the best tunes We come across.
The one thing wrong with it
is a technical recording prob-
lem: it was recorded at a dit-
ierent sound level, 1.6. if you
want to turn your volume con-
trol up. Since this comes irom
Warner Bros. (Which, the last
time i heard, was not a small
company), this shouldn't have
happened.

"Never My Love” has almost
as nice a melody as “Windy,”
but in a quieter way, and “Re-
quiem tor the Masses" has a
sound that's really appropriate;
the drum roll and morntul trum-
pet at the end hits home.

This background is one at the
deiiaite pluses oi the aim; it
seems as though it always tits
soit when necessary loud and
swinging when u should be. This,
and the tact that the singers
can sing, makes the album worth

 

Based on the rise at Nazi
Germany, the play consisted d
numerous unrelated scenes which
illustrated the sheets at this
phenomena and condede it.
in an short to make this not
only a work is historical and
artistic interest but at current
concern as well, the play’s di-
rector, Mr. James M. Leonard,
incorporated the use at mass
media by ﬂashing slides on the
procenium walls at Page Audi-
torium.

Bombardment

Thus the audience was bom-
barded with photos oi cmcentra-
tion camps, Nuremberg, Nari sol-
diers and also Hell’s Angels,
American lnterarmco, the re-
cent march on Washington, and
Superman. The poild: there are
phenomena equally wrong, unrea-
soned, ianatic andpotentially dan-
gerous in America today as once
existed in Germany.

Mr. Robert Donnelly's ex-
cellent set also endeavored to
combine this 1907 theme with
Brechtian technique. The set uti-
lised the bare roar brick wall
at the stage, a riser in the shape
oi a swastika, and a Panzar
made at an American eagle,
treads and swastikas flown above
the stage. -

Harsh Set

This harsh set, the presence
at the sound and light panels
and operators on the stage, and
the similar costumes at the act-
ors all contributed to the Brecht
theory at estrangement.

The scenes taken in themselves
were oi unequal quality. Special
notice is deserved by Barbara
Devio as the Jewish Wile, Judith
Wiesen as the Old Woman, and
Gary Aldrich as the Teacher.
other scenes, and in particular
the opening, did little more than
present actors taking up space
on the stage. The narration or
"Voice" was also excellently
done by William Snyder.

Eliorts to Comment

Althongh the eilort to com-
ment upon Modern America was
potentially very poweriul, it was
not, perhaps, as pointed as it
might have been. The T'viggy
masks carried by the actors
might better have been someone
of real import.

Somehow this seems a compro-
mise with the earlier endeavor
to make this meaningiul.And yet,
it would seem that the majority
oi viewers did leave the play with
the knowledge that something
meaningtul had been said. Thus,
taken as a whole this reviewer
would consider this a most or-
citing production.

ered her reputation to nill.
Toby, alter an appropriate length or time,
and with Vietnam and other more dramatic

oi weeks ago). Tinnks to the late modes,
and perhaps her marvelous role in “The Yellow
Rolls Royce," even the younger generation has

anticipated this return with great respect and '

enthusiasm. it seems quite obvious since it
was almost impossible to get tickets to this
production even beiore the opening.

ing-rid Bergman is 52 years old, "smokes
and drinks, and laughs a great deal and does
not worry.” And when asked it she should
do it over again (reierring to the past iew
years) she says, yes. I

Barbara Gelb, the co-author oi "O'Neill,"
has called "More Stately Mansions" the "child
O'Neill tore up," and this is exactly what he
did, and somewhat dramatically at that. Dur-
ing his ten-year illness beiore hisdeath,0'Neill
spent a great deal oi time dealing with his
workspboth iinished and unfinished. in 1953,
inthe Boston hotel room where he died, he
tore up what he thought to be the only exist-
ing manuscript or "More Stately Mansions"
and expressed his wish that no one should

ever have the opportunity to finish it. With '

this act, he considered it dead.
There existed, however, a second manu-

cctmtry. The play w h presently play-
ing in New York is that at its director Jon
Quintero who the play

, cut and
for this presentation. it was origimlly seven
hours long, but Mr. Guintero has cut it down
to three.

Joining Miss Bergman in New York are
Barry Macollum, Colleen Dewhurst, and Ar-
thur llill. The setshavobeendesignodby
Ben Edwards, costumes by Jane Greenwood,
and lighting by John Harvey.

i must say that line was looking rorward
to this great return, hoping that it would per-
haps be someth outstanding. I have seen’
Miss Bergman in several movies, and have
come to remect her for her dramatic tal-
ents, and so it was with considerable chag-
rin that i read Clive Barnes' review oi open-
ing night. lie was leit very unimpressed both
with the play itseli, and Miss Bergman's per-
iormanco.

This is so often the case with such hope-
in and illustrious openings, but it really is
a shine. Great periormers in their return
alter considerable time at absence are so
oiten careless in their selection at a suitable
play, and in the end, their reputation is mar-
red as a residt oi the hasty choice. The same
was true or Mary Martin who hastened back
alter her success in "The Sound oi Music,"
to open in the disastrous "Jenny," and even
now is starring in only a somewhat popu~
in show.

Despite wint critics say, however, . . .
'Mansions' is going to be popular ior awhile
—even_ it Just as a spectacle. Miss Bergman
leaves in February, so the rush is on to
get tickets to see her, it not ior her line
role, then for curiosity's sake. And the thea-
ter managers are banking on it because tick-
ets are expensive.

i wasn't too impressed with
the over-all qmlity oi the eight
new dramatic series that arriv-
ed on the national air waves
two months ago. in general, only
three oi these shows were even
slightly plausible in their basic
plot iormats and, as hasbeona
recent TV trend, all three were
"thrillers."

ABC, which this year gave us
the worst comedy and western,

is completely unbelievable.

in this one, several convicts
are sent into Germany pro-D-
Day with orders to commit sabo-

mayhem everywhue.
The resemblance toMGM'swide-
screen moneymaker, "The Dirty
Dozen,” couldn't be more
obvious.

But 'Dosen' had taste and
genuine excitement; 'Gorillas'
has neither, though the convicts
lave miraculously managed to
stay alive with the whole oi Ger-
many trying to and them, while

ABC, however, has been able

cop-and-criminals saga that gains
irom spirited, well-paced direc-
tion and dialogue, but mainly irom
the performances oi series leads
Jack Warden, Frank Converse
and Robert Hooks.

ABC's "Judd," though, is an
almost total disaster. its phony
attempt to be cool and tough is
iurther strengthened by the
cheap, hokey melodramas that
the show's writers and directors
grind out each week. Carl Betz,
in the title role as the ilashy,
moralistic Texas attorney, does
what he can to save the series,
but his talents are utterly wasted.

CBS has made a genuinely
worthless contribution to the
"art" or TV sentimentality with

Alpha so is a computer that
controls a technological trtopia;
its only demand is that logical
order be obeyed. in Alphaville
love equals sex, yes equals no,
and the only crume is to be-
have illoucally. The buildings
that house Alpha 60 glow like
monuments to technology. it is
iorbidden to ever ask "why?"
and even with the help oi Abba-
ville's Bible -- the dictionary
—-no one can ilnd outthemeen-
ing at the word "conscience."

This is the terrain of Jean-
Luc Gothrd's “Alphaville"(Cin-
ema Art Theatre), a brillialt
cinematic rendering oi a Brave
New World society. in this Mc-
Cluhanist landscape, Goths-d
places Lemmy Caution (Eddie
Constantine); a hard-boiled pri-
vate eye whose mission is to
destroy Alpha 60.

He succeeds, with the aid-oi
Pascal, poetry, Raymond Champ
ler, tricky gtmplay, and ids love
for Natasha von Braun (Am
Karim). The plot is comicbook
stuii, studded with parodies add
side-jokes, but the visual style
creates an Alphaville uncom-
iortably close to our society
today.

Cinematically, "Alphaville"
is the most satisfying Gothrd
