To App war
In RPI Concert

Woody Allen and the Lovin-
Spoonfui are scheduled to ap-
pear in concert at the R.P.1.

Field House today at 0:30 p.rn. ‘

as part it the '.t.P.I. Milita
Weekend. r

The Lovin' :ponful, atur-
fna. John Sebastian, Steve Boone,
Joe Butler and Jerry Yester,
is considered one of the top
American pop groups.

John Sebastian plays guitar,
harmonica, and auto-harp. He
began on the harmonica as a
child and guitar at the age a
12. After spending five years
in Italy and a year as a guitar-
malters' apprentice, Sebastian
worked on hlsownasastudio
harmonica player,’ playing with
jazz bands and some cf'the young
City-Country blues musicians.

Steve Boone eta on rhy-
thm guitar at 17 after an acci-
dent which lad him In tractiai
for two months. He plays elec-
tric bass for the group.

Joe Butler beganplayingdrums
early, accompanying an
accordion player when he was
13. During his college career,
he played and sang in a twist
band In several (1 the Chic Clubs
on Long Island.

Jerry Yester spectliros in the
guitar, banjo and mandolin and
has just recently joined the
group replacing Zal Yamovsky,
the original lead guitarist.

Woody Allen, considered one
of the leading comedians of the
day, who appeared inthe escep
tionally successful film, "What’s
New Pussycat7,” began his ca-
reer in the midst of a con-
spicuously undistinguished role
as a high school student. Turn-
ing out quips at the rate d 50
a day, Allen began writing for
Bid Caesar, Art Carney, Kay
Ballard, Carol Chanting, Gary
Moore and Buddy Hackett.

On stage, Woody Allen is an
ill fitting young man - slight,
fragile, decidedly defenseless.
He is not quite large enough
for his tweed sports coat. Hie
head is fashioned too small for
the thick. black-rimmed glasses
that frame large, vulnerable
brown eyes. Haberdashers have
not yet made a necktie in hie
sin. "I was classified 4-1’ by
the draft board. In the event d
war, I'm a hostage."

Broadway seems» to be, the
biggest attractialinleEBHOW.
There will be. timbers from
“Maine " “Sweet Charity,"
f‘Golden Boy," "0 r," "Por-
gy and Bess” and “ unny Girl."
In the folk sections variety is
ofthe essence; there are two
original folk songs, a Portu-
guese ballad, a Civil War song,
and an instrumental played by
Neil Linden.

The opening number — “It's
Today" from "Mame," is a rab-
ble-rousing song. and sets the
stage for the Varied acts to
follow. This number as well as
the closing number is done by
a chorus made up mostly of
"Carnival" chorus members and
who appeared in
"Carousel 86.” .

In the field (1 dance, SIDE-
SHOW presents three different
acts. Kathy Kelly, a member
of the modern dance club, will
open the section with a tap dance
to "Ev’ry Night at Seven." Joy
Couchman, who teaches dancing

.- to children, performs a modern

dance to "Life Goes On" from
"Zorba the Greek." Kathi 0'-
Neil dances to computer music
in a sequence called "Comput-
er ln Love."

Dennis Buck. who has slaved

the piano for various other shows
_ and accompanies many perform-

: «‘0 during sweet-low, plays his

own arrangement ofJudyGarIand
songs in what he calls “A Sa-
lute to Judy Garland," as well.

The second act is highlighted
by a Golden Oldies section fea-
turing four performers who have
apperead in the show for three
years or more. These perform-
ers are doing those numbers
which have "brought down the
house” in past years. Complet-
ing this section is the team of
Somerville and Rosenthal in a
satirical number from "Mame,"
— “Bosom Buddies."

Comedy is seen in a presen-
tation a two of Tom Ishrer’s
more popular numbers: "Smut"
and "Pollution." Also In the
comedy vein is the burlesque
strip which may be remember-
ed from last year’s show. In

. addition a comedy rendition of

"Grandma's Lye Soap" and "Lit-
tle Bo Peep," twonumbers which
have been so successful that they
are being repeated for the third
year, are on the agenda.

All choreography for the
show was designed by Kathy 0’-
Neil who did the choreography
for "Carnival" last year. The
technical arrangements were
worked out by Sharon Westfall
in the capacity (1 stage manager
and Eileen Deming as the light-
ing designer. Miss Deming is
assisted by Mark Zeek and Mich
aeI Walsh. Phyllis Larsen is at
the sound controls, and Alice
Spencer is taking care of the
properties.

"This year's team will be short on experience,"., declared “may 5.... man,“

Potter Quarterback Jim Curley led his club to a 7-0 win

over APA Saturday.

Curl
Puts

To McCloat
otter On Toe

In a tough defensive game, last Sunday, Potter
Club squeaked by Alpha Pl Alpha 7-0. Thus almost
assuring them of the league I championship for yet
another season. Defense highlighted the entire game
with each offense being stalled time and again after

trying to rally a drive.

In the entire first half
neither team obtained more
than one first down on a
drive as the defenses held
consistently.

Then in the third quar-
ter the Potter,offense finally
found the groove as Jim Curly
hit Ray McCIoat for along gain-
er carrying the bali into APA
territory. A short pass to Bob
Savicki followed as Potter pick-
ed up another first down. Then
after an incomplete pass in the
end zone, Curly hit Dan Crip-
pen on the twoyard line. APA
then dug in only to have Curly
roll out and throw a touchdown
strike to Ray McCloat in the end
zone. Wasting no time Curly
put the ball in the air once again
and hit Bob savicki for the ex-
tra point.

APA then tried to bounce back
and battle their way to a score
only to be denied each time as
the Potter defense held. Final
hope faded as McCIoat picked
off his second APA pass of the
day on the goal line with 40 sec-
onds to play. Potter than ran
out the clock winning 7-0.

Elsewhere In League I, TXO
went down to defeat at the hands
of the Nads and KB, 32-0 and
23-0 respectively.

In League II there is a close
race shaping up for the title.
At the halfway point STB leads
with a record of 4-0-1 with Tan-
pan Hall close on their heels
at 4-1. Followed in turn by Wa-
terbury and ALC at 3-2.

STB has looked sharp on of-
fense with both a passing and
running game, supported by good
defense, Tappan though has main-
ly relied upon a ground attack
set up with good field position
supplied by their rugged defend-
ers. Thus the season finale be-

tween these two clubs may shape
up to be an exciting title game.

F rosh Boaters
Lose One,
Tie One

by-Joel vollnski
The freshmen suffered their
worst week of the season since
their first two games when they
lost a well played game to New
Paltz, 3-2 and played a useless
0-0 tie with Rockland.

Coach Schiefflien called the
freshmens’ game against New
Paltz their finest effort of the
season. New Paltz was probably
the toughest and most skilled op-
ponent the frosh have played all
year. However, the freshmen led
2-1 entering the last quarter,
only to blow their cool and even-
tually lose their lead and the
ﬂame.

Anny Yturraspe put Albany
ahead after six minutes of the
game, when he booted his third
goal of the year over the head
of the short New Paltz goalie.
The lead didn’t last for long as
New Paltz tied the game with
their first goal with three min-
utes remaining in the first quar-
ter. In the second period the
fresh scored again, this time
when Ron Spratt headed in a lob
pass from Volinski.

As has been their problem all
year, the freshmen did not know
how to protect or build their
lead. They tended to play strict-
ly defense, and In spite of the
brilliant play of goalie Rich Ranc-
kin (24 saves) Albany could not
prevent the fabulous front line of
New Paltz from scoringtwo more
times in the final period.

Undefeated Season Ended

by sally Hayes

The Women's Field Hockey
Team ended Its undefeated sea-
son with a loss to Potsdam, 1-0.
Connie Carpenter, Freshman
center halfback, played an out-
standing game, as she managed
to hold back a strong offensive
line put forth by Potsdam team.

On a happier note, Albany shut
out Oneonta 3-0 on November 1.
Scoring for Albany were Connie
Carpenter with a hard drive in
the first half and Pat Tavltian
with two goals in the last half

the game. 8110 Sutton contin-
ued to do outstanding goal work
as she has 'since the season
first began.

The Women's Field Hockey
Team dropped its second game
to Plattsburgh last Saturday by
the score of 4-0. The girls play-
ed a hard game, though plagued
by rainy weather and poor field
conditions. The last game of the
season will be against llartwick
at their field.

Several members of the
w.A.A. will attend the NYAIIFCW
Conference at Corning, New York
this Saturday.

The athletic conference, which
has as its theme, “Are We Serv-
ing Our Purpose" has been or-
ganist by Albany State, and will
feature a series of interesting
and informative discussions and
speeches.

basketball mentor Dick Sauers whose teams have compiled 0105.94 record overthe

last 12 years, "But 1 think we have more talent and depth than last year’s-squad. We’ve
‘ won a lot of ball games over the last two years because I've had smart men in Bloom
(Mike) and Constantino (Jim) who were able to control the game under pressure. If
we can develop these players. we should do all-right." ~ .' ,

The above quotation
can aptly describe the
makeup of this year' a team .
While returning Iettermen
will form the nucleus of'
the squad, Albany fans will
be watching seven new

faces on the hardcourt
throughout the year.

Jim Cavcrly, a8'0"180-pound-
er, will probably see most ac-
tion as a guard. Jim,a junior

transfer from Brooms Tech maj- .

oring In business education, at-
tended Aquinas Institute in R0-
chester. Averaging 13 points per
game, he was all N.Y.S.J.C. last
year.

Vern Lannier, 0'1" and 180
lbs. and a transfer from Iona
College is a- native d Schenec-
tady where he attended Bishop
Gibbons. Vern was Little Dioce-
san All-American his last year
at Gibbons. Aforward, he'll add
much needed rebounding
strength.

Bob Wood, via Troy High and
JCA will play a lot (1 guard. A
6', l75-pounder, Wood averaged
24.0 (or JCA and received all
N.C.C. honors. He possesses a
quick, deadly outside shot.

Dave Riegel, who stands 6’4"
and weighs 205 lbs., comes to
Albany from Brockport State.
A business administration major
from Batavia, Rlegel will either
play center relieving Scott Price
or play a deep forward posi-
lion.

Jack Adams, a sophomore,
moves up to the varsity after lead-
ing last year's fresh In scoring
(18.9 pts. per game) In addition
to being Its MVP. Only 5’9"
and weighing 105, Adams com-
bines quickness and accuracy
from the outside that make him
difficult to defend against.

Ed Arseneau, 6’0", 185 lbs.
is a junior transfer from Mohawk
Valley C.C. 'Has fully re-
covered frcm a broken leg which
sidelined him all last year.

Stefan Smigiei, a junior trans-
fer from st. Francis, won't be
eligible until second semester.

Albany Freshmen Hunters take their mark for the start of

another successful race.

Fresh Guinea New Poll:

Larry Frederick shattered the
freshmen course recordsaturday
as the Albany frosh deVastated
the New Paltz fresh by a 17-42
count.

Frederick covered the New
Paitz course in stlme of 15:11,
20 seconds better than the pre-
vious record. Don Myers ofAI-
bsny was right behind as he fin-
ished In 15:17, also breaking the
previous record.

The next man to finish was
Pat Gepfert, another Albany run-
ner. Tom Goldpaugh «New Paltz
then broke up the stream of
Albany finishers. He was prompt-
Iy followed by Albany's Jim Mas-
tromarchi and Jay Kaplan, thus
the baby Great Danes grabbed
five of the first six places, for
another decisive victory.

Besides the fine races turned
in by Frederick and Myers,Mas-

tromarcni’s performance should
also be noted, as he has been de-
veloping steadily, with his fifth
place finish representing an ex-
cellent Improvement.

The fresh finished their sea-
son Tuesday with a trip to Le-
Moyne.
