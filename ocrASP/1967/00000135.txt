by Tim Keeley

At the recent China Seminar,
Dr. Nai-Ruenn Chen, assistant
professor oi econOmics at
Cornell University, spoke on
"The Economic Development of
China."

Dr. Chen began by saying that
“the overpopulation oi China is
the most important factor in de-
termining its economic develop
ment." He went on to back his

 

 

 

 

statement with nonunion sit
tistics.
Since 1957 the Communists

have not released any popula-
tion statistics. But consider-
ing the rate oi increase at about
2.2 per cent per year, this would
put the population at about 750
million.

About 80 per cent oi this popu-
lotion is supported by agri-
culture. Thus Dr. Chen declared,
"'l‘tre Chinese economic growth
depends upon agriculture."
lie continued that however in
1952, when the Cpmmunist
Chinese initiated their first five

Their strategy also failed to
take over-population into account.
Although one million new Jobs
were created, the number of eli-
gible workers increased by eight

lem oi unemployment.

By 1960 the lag in agriculture
was causing a bottleneck to in-

Dr. Chen concluded with the
remark that little is really known
about what is presently being
done to remedy these situations.

Following the main lecture,
several guest discussantsadded
briei comments. They were Dr.
Lawrence Abbott oi Union Col-
lege, Young Chin Kim of Siena

of Skidmore College.

They pointed out the parrallel-
ism between Taiwan and China
and also posed several questions.

Dr. Chen was a research eco-
nomist at the University oi Chi-
cago and taught at Berkley for
four years before coming to Cor-
nell. in addition, he has written
two books, The Economy on Main-

Mr. Max Schactman, editor of
the Daily Worker, founder of
Young Communists, expelled
from the Communist party and
currently a devout socialist,
spoke Sunday night on “The Rust-
sian Revolution: Fifty Years,
Promise and Reality."

Beginning his lecture with an
explanation: "Emulsions are an
honored tradition oi any radical
movement," Schactmsn briefly
traced the Bolshovik Revolution
as a triumphant and enduringfac-
tor in world events.

He stressed that Russia was
the first country to establish
a socialist "power," and not a

Renoir’s ‘Illusion’

IFG Film Tonight

Jean Renoir’s "The Grand 11-
lusion" is tonight’s presentation
of the International Film Group.

This classic film tells of a
group of French soldiers taken
prisoner during World War 1
and oi their desperate attempts
to escape.

The crux of the film is the
idea of a “gentleman’s war" an
idea tested and disproved by
the new mechanized means of
warfare.

Renoir is perhaps the most
famous of French film-makers,
known for "Rules of the Game'
“The Golden Coach," and “The
River."

"Grand illusion” is general.
1y regarded as his masterpiece,
and has been called, "the most
telling shaft which the cinema
has ever directed against the in-
stitution of war.”

“The Grand Illusion" stars
Jean anin and Erich von Stroe-
helm. it will be shown in Drop.
or 349 at 7:00 and 9:15. Ad.
mission is $.25 with student tax.

o On Russian Revolution

socialist “society.” in order to
arrive at their original aims,
the Revolutionaries regarded
world revolution as imminent.
However, the movement that was
to save socialism from doom
was never realized.

The goal of officials subject
to rotation so that "ovary char.
woman would have her hand" in
state matters was never reached.

Due to the fact that a modern
society cannot be built upon
a backward base, the Regime
was driven up a “blind alley."
Under Stalin, the working class
in Russia became an obstacle to
the rapid process which was re.
quired for mass industrializa-
tion.

A paradox arose: the social.
ist idea became dependent upon
the exploitation of labor.

Under Stalin's direction more
Communists were imprisoned
and killed than by the Hitler and
Mussolini regimes combined. An
entire population was reduced to
abject terror. A new class oi oi.
ficials, maintaining a monopoly
on the social, economic and politi-
cal facets oi the society, slam.
med the door on socialism.

Schactman ended his discus-
sion with the idea that man was
not created solely to “rule and
be ruled," and that "socialism
remains a powerful and promis-
ing suggestion to the Russian
population, whose revolution
marked a long but not enduring
attempt of man to raise him.

Board Institutes
Winter Weekend:

Scheduled For Dec.

Special Events Board will be
sponsoring a new event this so-
mester, a Winter Weekend from
Dec. 15 to 1’7. The festival is
to include a gymnastic exhibi-
tion, a formal dinner-dance and
the traditional Holiday Sing.

The gymnastic team will be
coming from Denmark and per-
forming on Friday night. The
place of this exhibition has not
yet been selected.

A dinner-dance on Saturday
night will revive the 30-year-
old tradition of “Winterluds.”
To be held in the ballroom,
the dance will be one of the few
events where liquor will be serv-
ed this season.

The weekend will be capped off
by the Holiday Sing on Sunday.
The co-chairmen of this event
are Joe McCullough and Linda
Bosco.

 



Special gm. Board is pr...

_ ently planning to conduct a poll

later.this month to determine the
amountoi student interest and
support oi the ledtJastestival.
' The results of the poll will
indicate to‘the Board whether
enough interest in_ the Festival
currently exists to war-rent
spending the allocated $10,000

dget.
Present: tentative plans for the

Festival include a concert by"

Louis Armstrong as the main
festival concert. This decision
was made by Special Events
Board as a whole in the hopes
of creating interest in the Festi-
val.

Armstrong, who will cost $6,-
000 will be hired as a result oi a
consensus of opinion by the en-
tire events board rather than by
the co-chairmen who have not yet
been selected.

The Board felt that a perform-
er such as Armstrong would not
only draw a Jazz crowd but would
also draw those not deeply in-
tsrested in jazz.

They also felt the remaining
$4,000 would be sufficient to it-
nance the minor concerts.

Nicholas Dugo, chairman of
Special Events Board comment-
ed on the situation at the Festi-
val after a meeting held Tues-
day, stating that although co-
chairmen have not been select-
ed, the Festival is still schedul-
ed. It is to be held on the same
weekend as state Fair and’Par-
ents' Weekend, however, these
budgets will in no way be com-
bined.

Each event will retain its own
chairmen and its own budget,
and each event will be respon-
sible for its own publicity.

The reason they are being
scheduled together is only in the
interest of creating support for
all three; it is hoped that by
scheduling all three in the same
weekend they will complement
each other.

Dugo commented that the rea-

Stronger Hook-Up
From WSUA Radio

WSUA Radio is now broad-
casting with increased power to
the Dutch Quadrangle due to a
new audio line which was in-
stalled this past week by the tele-
phone company.

Presently all dorms on the
Dutch Quadrangle should be able
to receive WSUA as well as any
of the area commercial stations.
Also, due to the new audio line,
transmission to the Colonial
Quadrangle should also be slight.-
ly improved.
