University Gets Grants
For BiolOgical Study

Two awards totaling $82, 791
have been received by the Uni-
versity to support biological re-
search proJects being directed
by Dr. Yash P. Myer, assistant
professor of chemistry at the
university.

One grant is for $50,000 from

‘ tlle National Science Foundation

for research entitled“Conforma~
tion of Cytochromes." The other
award is for $32,761 from the
American Cancer Society to sup
port Myer's research entitled,
"Conformation and Function oi
Ribonuclease.”

The NSF grant, for a two year
period, is concerned with the
significance oi the enzymes in-
volved in the mechanism oi the
utilization of energy in the body.

The basic goal of the proJect
is to investigate the relation
ships between conformation and
the biological activity oi the
enzymes involved in the electron
transport system.

in the research supported by
the ACS for two years, Myer is
concerned with further study of
ribonuciease, an enzyme which
breaks down ribonucleic acid.
He stated that the orders
of ribonulcease in governing its
properties may develop know-
ledge oi the control mechanism
of cell growth.

Myer was born in indie and
received his basic education in
that country. lie holds bachelor's

and master's degrees from Pan-
Jah University in lndia. In that
country, from 1953 through 1957,
he conducted investigations re-
lated to surface absorption and
capillary condensation.

The scientist came to the
United States in 1957 when he
began graduate work at the Uni-
versity oi Minnesota.

He completed his doctorate at
the University of Oregon in 1961
and that same year he Joined
the staff of Yale University where
he was in the department oi

biochemistry until 1966 when he
came to this University.

Students Review
Informative Films

Concerning LSD,VD

LSD and venereal disease were
the subJecis oi two films re-
viewed by a group oi students,
faculty and residence staff mem-
bers Wednesday, Nov. 1.

The showing last week was
introduced by Miss Minnie Mee-
gan of the Health Service to
consider films oi potential value
available to the student body.
The reviewers were to discuss
the informative quality oi the
films and their appeal to the
college level audience.

"LSD—insight or insanity"
explored the world of LSD, the
effects the user experiences and
the unpredictable long range ef-
fects of excessive or prolonged
use. The film also gave atten-
tion to the lack oi researched
knowledge about the workings
of LSD in the body.

Syphilis and gonorrhea, ven-
ereal diseases most common in
teen-agers, were explained in the
film "A Quarter Million Teen-
agers." How the diseases are
transmitted, symptoms, treat-
ment and effects ware covered
in depth.

 Trustees
Form New Policy
For Student Tax

The State University Trustees
have formed a policy on student
assessments within the units in
the University system, President
Evan R. Collins announced Mon-

- day at his weekly conferencewith
students.

Collins stated that this policy

is to endorse the policy oi allov-
lng the students to levy a tax on
themselves, while not making this
tax in any way a state tax.

The State University policy
sanctioning student - imposed
assessments (or such' student
activity and educational pro
grams as the State- operated
campuses may wish to conduct
was approved by the State Uni-
versity Trustees on Nov, 9. The
policy is subject to the following
general guidelines:

"1. Student assessments may
continue to be collected on a
voluntary basis to support student
approved programs. Students who
do not elect to pay such assess-
ments may be denied privileges
of these programs.

“2. With the approval oflthe
campus president, duly elected
student governments may deter-
mine the amouni oi the student
assessment on the basis oi de-
monstrated need and prudent con-
sideration. No arbitrary ceiling
is imposed by the Trustees.

“3. Students in the State Uni-
versity, at both the undergraduate
and graduate level, are encourag-
ed to be a part of the campus
community by electing to partici-
pate voluntarily in payment of
these locally determined assess-
ments and in the program they
support.

"4. Student government and
University administration on the
campuses are charged with the
responsibility of identifying and
strengthening procedures where-
by appropriate review and evalua-
tion of programs financed through
student assessments are made
periodically."

The Trustees also stipulated
that the Chancellor oi the State
University shall, from time to
time, cause to be reviewed with
the campuses the various activi-
ties supported by voluntary stu-
dent assessments to determine
whether any should more appro-
priately be supported by State
or other funds.

University Prof
To Conduct Poﬂ

by Vic Looper

Dr. Romolo Tiogo has announc-
ed that a Sociological survey is
being taken tofind out the opinions
of college students on student
protest groups and organizations.

The survey is being taken by
the students in the experimental
Survey Resaarch Course. This
course is a combination of intro-
duction to Research Methods and,
Survey Design and Analogy.

To Dr. Tiogo's knowledge this
is the first time that an in depth
study has been taken to find out
student opinion of protest groups.

The survey is a pro-coded
structured questionnaire based
on a flow chart form which offers

a series of alternatives. The.

survey leads all with background
questions e.g. what is your major,
class year, martial status etc.

This format is then followed
by questions that nskwhatls your
definition of a protest group;
what organizations do you con-
sider protest groups; do you be-
long to any or not etc. ’l‘llenames
of those that participate and their
answers will be completely con-
fldential.

The people, all University stu~
dents, picked for this survey were
selected by random sampling,
and represent a broad cross sec-
tion of the student body, both
undergraduate nn'd graduate. The
people participating have already
been selected.

The survey has been protested
and takes about 20 minutes to
complete. The survey resultswill
not be known until at least the
end 0! the semester.

Dr. Tlogo has expressed his
hope that the survey takers will
be given complete cooperation
by those students that have been
selected to participate.

Over Three Million Dollars
Given In Financial Aid

At his weekly conference with

- students Monday, President Evan

R. Collins announced that stu-

dents at the University are re-

ceiving about $3,964,000 in fi-
nancial aid.

This aid includes all loans,
grants, scholarships and work-
study programs finances by state
and federal agencies as well as
by the University. The money 15
available to students through
eleven different programs.

The three federal programs,
administered by the University,
total $1,201,880. These financial
aid measures affect 1,872 stu-
dents. Two of the programs are

financed in part by the Unlver-.

slty.

2,000 University student are
receiving Regents Scholarships
totaling to about $700,000. Over
double the number of students
(4,900) are being given an esti-
mated $820,000 through the
scholar incentive program.

State University Scholarships
have been given out to 750 stu-
dents. $l50,000 has been com-
mitted to these students.

Bud and Miners
In Recent Poll

Mildred Polsenski, chairman
of the Community Programming
Commission announced that Bud-
weiser and Millers were the
winners of the Beer Pool spon-
sored last week by the Com-
mission.

The purpose of the poll was
to determine student preference
over what beer should be afferv
ed in the rathskellar which is
scheduled to open soon.

She also commented that the
Commission if presently formu-
lating the final plans for the re-
decoratlon of the "cage" section
of the snack bar which will later
become the rathskellar.

Because the Commission faces
working with a limited budget
Miss Polsenski stated they must
try and plan inexpensive and
easy to install changes.

Presently the Commission has
hopes to install old barn planking
on the walls, to secure shutters
for the windows, and to change
the lighting system in some way.

The old wooden tables from
the "CAVE" in Draper cafeteria
have already been secured by the
Commission and presently they
are looking for some different
chairs.

The Commission will later de-
signate the responsibility at the
carrying out of this policy to a
newly formed sub-committee oi
the Commission. the Campus
Center Governing Board.

out through its own programs
$1,092,000 to students this year.
There are programs for gradu-
ates as well as undergraduates.
These financial aids include short
term‘ loans, scholarships, and
student employment. Over 2,000
students are involved in these
programs.

The president also read a
statement from the trustees of
the State University concerning
athletics. The statement indorsed
physical education, recreation
and otner athletic programs. The
trustees deemed this activity an
"integral part of the university
program."

President Collins reported that
the Department of Classics has
received an allocation from the
Smithsonian institute. The grant
will finance an archeological
search around the ancient city
of Yavniel. Now called Yavne.
the city is located north of Tel
Aviv in israel.

During the question period the
president was asked about the
University's policy on open
houses. President Collins stated
that the University Council does
not engage ln“guardhouseloiter-
ing" but only in deciding the
basic values which should be ad-
hered to. He went further to say
that the particular open house
rules are drawn up by LAAC
and the dorm governments.

WASHINGTON (CPS) — The
Teacher Corps has received'such
a severe financ ‘ial blow that it
may not be able to recruit a
new group of interns forihesum-
mer and fall of 1908.

The blow came this week when
I and sent to
President Joinson the approprla»
tions bill for the Departments of
Labor and Health, Education,
Welfare. The bill‘lncluded only
010.5 million for the Teacher
Corps, far less than the $09
million requested by President
Johnson and Teacher Corps of-
iicials. -

“This is certainly not expans-
sion money. It isn't even hold-
even money," a Teacher Corps
official said. I

The source said the bill will
not finance the Corps post next
June 30. "There will benomoney
for us to go beyond the 1,900
Corpsmen we now have, and we
will lose 900 of tilose at the and
of this school year."

The Teacher Corps, which
sends college students working on
their master's degree to teach
in slum schools, is Just one of
many Federal agencies which
have suffered because of pros-
sures on Congress to reduce
spending.

Congress extended the contro-
versial Corps for three years
this past summer, but now has
not supplied it with the funds to
meet the needs of urban and
rural slums.

Even though the Corps can be
saved by a supplemental appro-
priation next year, much of the
damage to the program already
has been dorie. Colleges and uni.-
versities will be unable to plan
their training programs, and lo-
cal school systems will not be
able to count onasupply of corps-

   
 
  

Corps  '
men for their sehools. ‘ -

Mos local school systems be-
gin ring teachers around the
ilrst of the ' of the next sehooi’ ’
year. _ I 'r ,-

ln addition, the shortage; of
funds probably will keep poten-
tial corpemen from applying. 

. The .6 m  ‘
:Ilas recommended by a Senate-_ ~

  

no funds for the Corps. The
compromise was accepted byboih
Houses with little clients.

The Corps' appropriation is
included in the $3.26 billion bill
which Congress passed for the
Departments of Laborand Health,
Education, and Welfare_. .

The bill contains $2.56 bil-
lion for HEW, an amountof $141.2
million below the Administra-
tion’s request, but 0249.3 mil--
lion above the HEW approprie;
tion for Fiscal 1967. For the
U.S. Office of Education, the
bill appropriates $1.96 billion, a
decrease of $63.6 million from
the budget request for the new
fiscal year, and a decrease of
$9.1 million from 1967 appro-
prietions.

Congress again allowed no
funds to support the international
Educational Act. Authorised in
1965, the program has never
been funded. It would pro-
vide grants for graduate pro-
grams in international studies
'and research andimprovements
in undergraduate curricula in ill-
ternational affairs.

The Act also provides for the
establishment of the National
Advisory Committee on Inter-
national studies. President John-
son hnd requested $56.5 million
for the program.

Plans For Indian Quad
Nearing Completion

by Janis Samuels

The working drawings for the
lndian Quad are nearing comple-
tion, and it is anticipated that
construction will begin this
spring. This fourth quad iohouse
1300 students will show no out-
ward signs of change. However,
it will show a "grand depart.
ure from suite living."

Mr. Walter Tisdale, Assistant
to the President for Planning
and Development, feels the III-
dian Quad will offer the student
choice as to his living accom-
modations since for many the
suite is too public and too dis.
turbing.

Though the four and six man
suites that exist now will be
available, the predominate set-up
will be the two bedroom arrange-
ment. Four students will share a
common entrance called a vesti-
bule which will lead into two larg-
er bedrooms that the present
suites now offer. There will be no
common study or private bath-
room.

There will also be more single
rooms either Joined as the third
bedroom oi the present suite
arrangement or as a completely
separate unit. Thus the low.

risers will offer everythingfrom
single to four, five or six per-
son occupancy.

ln the Tower, there will be no
suites; everything will be the
two bedroom arrangement. There
will be more expansive lounges
for each floor that will provide
kitchenettes and storerooms.
The podium level of the Tower
will house the mailroom and
boxes for the entire quad.

innovations are also planned
for the U-shaped lounge such as
individual dining units and areas
with moving partitions to pro-
vide privacy for such things as
committee and sorority and ira-
ternity meetings. There wiilalso
be for small lounges off the
flag room, more recreational
facilities and TV in the base-
ment.

The dining room will be set-up
differently in order to speed up
the annoying wait in line. A
“scramble arrangement" willbe
instituted for lunch and dinner
meals. There will be individual
stands for cold foods, but foods,
desserts, and beverages to en-
able students to go and pick up
what they want and so avoid
unnecessary tie-ups.
