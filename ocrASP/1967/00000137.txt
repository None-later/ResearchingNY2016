Our "Free University" is
servings dual purpose: it has
been undertaken by Lou Strongas
his project for the Individual
Study Program in Sociology, as
well as an experiment in the edu-
cations] process. The idea first
came to him in the guise of an
article in Playboy ("Youtli, The
Oppressed Majority") and it has
been formulating ever since. His
plan centers around the discon-
tentment with the present state

rsity's Free University Lou Strong takes a

break at last week's discussion on campus political groups and their inﬂuence.

University Academic Plans
Have Two-FoldFunction

by Carl Lindeman

The first of a three-part ser-
ies dealing with the projected
growth of the State University
system appeared in last Friday's
issue. The second article oi this
three-part series will deal with
Campus Academic Planning for
two periods.

The first of these periods will
cover 1967 through 1975. The
second period from 1975 through
1980 and beyond.

The function of the Campus
Academic Plan is two-fold. First,
the State University Centers
Presidents are invited to com-
ment on projected growth within
the university, stressing “the
ends of higher education, the
composite goals of the institu-
tion and concerns which trans-
cend the disciplines and organi-
zational units."

A second function of the Cam-
pus Academic Plan is to strive
for some prediction of the chang-
es that may occur within society
which will effect the obligations
of the University during the per-
iod from 1975 through 1980 and
beyond.

The preparation of the plan is
submitted by Samuel B. Gould,
Chanceer of the State Univerv
sity oi New York to all Univer-
sity and Community College in«
etitutions within the State Uni-
versity system. The preparation
of the Campus Academic Plan
for was emphasizes the use of
questions in discovering campus
responses tothe obligations ofthe
University by functions. .

nder the function of curricu-
lum several important questions
, are considered. In the area of
relationships between programs,
the report asks "what are the
relationships between the arts
and sciences and the profession-
al programs" and "what are the
relationships between the pro-

fessional and technical
grams?” '

In linking educational goals
and physical education programs;
"what is the existing relation-
ship between the physical edu-
cation program and the education-
al objectives of the campus?”

The contribution, quality and
the characteristics of the faculty
is a second major concern of the
report. The degree of satisfac-
tion or dissatisfication of pres-
ent faculty members and the
problems oi recruitment are two
important concepts in planning
future growth for the university
system.

The amount oi involvement by
faculty “in the affairs oi the
campus other thandirectlnstruo-
tion and research" are consid-
ered vital in this aspect oi the
university. Accompanying are
"what changes in degree or kind
are expected to take placein such
involvement in campus affairs
between 1967-75?"

Another important point oi the
plan examines the characteris.
tics oi the Campus Student body.
A series of questions are con-
structed with the purpose of de-
fining “campus climate" in
terms oi the attitudes of stu-
dents.

HWhat is the present orien-
tation of the students toward the
purpose of their college experi-
ence?” “What criteria would be
used to indicate the homogeneity
of the shutouts and those which
would be used to indicate their
heterogeneity?” v

Student involvement in cum-
pua policies and programs, along
with the main iunctions oistudent
government, are also questioned
in this area.

A final major point in receiv«
ing opinions on University growth
between 1907.76 is the expected
development of campus activity

pro

in community service willow.

these activities are related to
the academic programs of the
campus.

As a second function of the
plan, questions are asked about
the "speculations and prediction
concerning the very long range
future of society and its impli-
cation for changes in University
obligations."

Beyong 1975 the field ofeducar
tion will probably see the devel-
opment oi translation machines
which will eliminate language
barriers, computerized teaching
machines, the substitution of new
synethtic materials for ultralight
construction, to mention only a
few of the possible changes.

The necessity oi entering col-
lege will be felt to a far greater
degree than it is presently. "The
admissions tests and achieve-
ment tests may become obsolete
if the computer can tell both stu-
dent and instructor how well the
student is proceeding academic-
ally at any given moment.”

The ability to predict the fu-
ture is obviously limited but the
purpose oi the plan after 1975
and beyond is to act as a stim-
ulating agent. Will higher educa-
tion guard against boredom in a
society where physical labor will
decrease, where a shorter work
week exists and a society in
mhlgh leisure will be incrensv

8

Will the institute of the uni-
versity disappear as' more ef-
fective methods of learning de-
velop? Or will the University
assume new roles that business
or government are unable to ad-
ministrate?

Past history has shown that
the university has acted as an
important stimulus, often as a
depressant also, within society.
The importance of examining the
future of this institution is cru-
cisliogeraiore, in understanding

.gxperlrnen V seminar, the die—
tinotion being that our 
are; chosen mainly by our organ-
isers, while a Free University
allows its participants free reign
in the decision oi topics. The lat-
ter is a more convenient title,
because it may be recognised by
a wider variety of people.

The three main topics under
review this semester are: “The
Total Interaction of Modern Art,"
"the Iiritan Ethic .111. Brother-
ly Love," and “Academic Power
and National and International
Politics." The idea has been to
integrate many ideas under one
general heading. For instance,
last Wednesday night the sub-
jects ﬂuctuated from "What Stu-
dent Pressure Groups Accomp-
lish" to war, black power, Nu-
remburg, and the morality of
dissent.

Attendance has been extreme-
ly poor. Lou felt that either the
more established groups on cam-
pus were distracting students,
holding meetings on similar eve-
nings, or a much more logical
explanation: people on this carn-
pns refuse to attempt newevents.

The relatively small turnout
has not detracted from the suc-
cess of the program but has
created a small, open, intimate
atmosphere conducive to learn-
ing. Lou emphasized that as a
result oi these seminars, people
“may learn how to put their
brains to use. which is a raritv.
especially on this campus." He
hopes that his graduation in Jars
uary will not bring the experi-
ment to a standstill, but that it
may extend into second semes-
ter.

One need not spend more than
a few hours in our dormitories,
classrooms, or student center
in order to perceive an under-
current oi discontent, am, un-
fortunately, resignation. Why
have we, myself inclutled, allow-

!” fungi the “amt u “4 that has become increasingly

"I‘terndtlv

.4

e

ed ourselves to become so in-
adequate as to be completely un-
a’wsre oi glaring ‘iaults and in-
sensitive to solutions? A recent
article by PaulGoodman explains
this:

The structure oi society

dominant in our country is dis-
astrous to the growth oi excel-
lance and manliness. The sys-
tem buys up as much intelli-
gence as it‘can and muffles
voices oi dissent; and then ir-
refutably procldms that itself
is the only possible society—
nothing else is thinkable. we
seem' to have lost our genius
ior inventing changes to' satisfy
cyringneeds."

There is the possibility that
in our shallow attempts to “play
it cool" we are freezing our ini-
tiative and warming up tonothlng
short oi cynicism. There are
numerous alternatives open to
those who have become disen—
chanted with apathy and criti-
cism. The Free University is a
perfect example; We are offered
so many other opportunities.

When we become trapped into
thinking there is nothing we can
do, we may as well submit to
the "guillotine" of not thinking
at all.

on campus. Ramparts nee call-
ed MSU a “service station" uni-
versity, and this event is one of
the best examples oiMSU's serv-
ice to both government and in-
dustry. However, the career
carnival hasgain'edasignificance
which it sponsore' undoubtedly
did not anticipate — it has he-
come a focal point for campus
radicals. What better opportunity
to confront the military-indus-
trial complex ihan when it is
actively recruiting in your own
student union?

What self-respectingsns mem-
ber could sit idly by while the
National Security Agency,
General Motors, the FBI, Dow
Chemical Co., The Federal
Bureau of Narcotics, Chrysler
Corp., the Michigan State Police,
General Electric, A.T. a T., The
Peace Corps, the Marine Corps,
the Army, TheAir Force, I.B.M.,
and dozens of others have
literally “set up shop” on
campus? MSU - SDS did not sit
by.

This year the career carnival,
titled "Careers '67," was on
Monday, Oct. 9 and Tuesday,
Oct. lo. Nothing out of the ordin-
ary happened Monday; there was
leaf-letting throughout the day
(the leaflet pointing out, among
other things,- that " the Selective
Service Systems 'manpower
channeling’ program. . . is the
key to understanding a greatdeal
of what is happening at Careers
'67.") without incident.

Later, a major portion of the
patrons of the career carnival
had been attracted and the game
continued before a considerable
of many) and its career carnival.

Each year MSU runs a"career
carnival" to which many major

players are invited. Boothe are

set up by the employers and the
recruitment usually attracts over
half of the 38,000-plus students
audience. During the game, also.
other sne'm had been walking
through the exhibit withalslmber
of signs and posters: "The Only
Show in Town;" "Dow—Better
Living Through Better Chemis-
try"; "ALL of America is Play-
ing Monopoly"; "Who owns the
Monopoly Board"; and "Ameri-
can Know-liow Did This" (widi
the picture from a Ramparts-
article on the children of Viet-
mm).

In not too lam a time cops
appeared, in fact quite a number
of them. Not wanting to really
go to jail, the Monopoly players
suddenly picked up their board
and as a group disappeared from
the career carnival.

They came back —- without
Monopoly Board and huddled on
the same spot where the game
had been played. While the cops
were waiting for the “worst,”
signals were given from the
huddle, and on the word “Go!”
the group suddenly split into
two's and three’s, and heading
in every which way, made for
the booths and exhibits. And that’s
all there was to it. But then
again, there really was more.
The rest of the eveningwas spent
talking individually or in small
groups to the representatives
in the different booths. Dow
Chemical had to talk to radicals.
The Marines were visany sick
of talking to radicals. The FBI
denied they harassed radicals.
The state Police tried to ignore
radicals. Everyone talked to
radicals.

As someone once said, "those
kids sure be troublemakers."

Among the staff members in-

much of the classified work ac-
quired by the university in the
postwar years. He was booed
when he declared his pride lathe

About thirty faculty members.

whole thing were found in Ohio,
