Differcnice

  

e controversy w c has been build-
ing up over the 1968 Jazz Festival can
finally be waded through. The red tape
is unwound, and all .that- remains is _a
basic difference in philosophy between
the Special Events Board and the pro-
ponents of a festival for the sake of jazz.

This is indicated by the fact that Spe-
cial Events Board as a whole has decid-
ed to appropriate $6,000 of the $10,000
Festival budget to secure Louis Armstrong
as the main concert artist for the Fes-
tival. This is all being done before the
selection of the co-chairmen for the event.

The rationale behind this move is that
they should begin building up the concept
of the Festival—giving it a big name by
contracting someone who is famous. Later
will be the time to concentrate on the jazz
angle, when they have a bigger budget
and a bigger name.

This philosophy does not fit with the
whole idea of having a jazz festival;
the $6,000 presently being spent on Arm-
strong might be better spent on improv-
ing the range and variety of the jazz ar-
tists.

The Special Events Board voices its
concern with spending the student tax
money wisely. Because they have receiv-

Back

After listening to the gab returns,
and reading the reports on the closed
evaluation session held last Thursday
among the top student leaders we now
know two things. First, we now know
that the non-existent Supreme Court does
exist, and second we know that there is
a communications problem on campus.

Actually the existence of the first proves
the second. Apparently somewhere some-
one dropped a card saying, "The sky is
falling, there is no Supreme Court.” The
tragedy of course results when every-
one believes it.

Through all the controversy and ranting
and raving about justice (largely on our
part, fools that we are) no one really
knew there was a Court. No one in
government had double checked the re-
port, and the Supreme Court Chief-Jus-
tice didn‘t either. In fact the Supreme
Court deserves the Chicken Licken Award
for their commendable pacific reaction.

The rest of the evaluation session
centered around the communications prob
lem on campus. That thegreatest evi~
dedce 'of" it"was before" their ideas ‘di'd‘

ed only one report on the ’67 Festival
which did not contain sufficient financial -
figures, they are now, after all this time,
going to throw it up to student vote on
whether or not it is worth the expense.

Our feeling is this: the money has al-
ready been appropriated for the Festival.
Rather than quibble over it, the money,
all of it, should be given to competent
chairmen as soon as possible. These
chairmen should then be. allowed to try
to build a reputation for the Festival.

We hope that this is not the doom of
the Festival; it is one of the truly un-
usual and forward-looking things pres-
ently being done at the University. If
the Special Events Board is so concern-
ed over how fairly it is allocating student
funds, it should have decided to run a
poll on everything, because, frankly, (al-
though we do not mean to knock tradi-
tion) we think most students would rather
vote out such events as the Bonfire Mix-
er, the newly formed Parents' Weekend,
and Campus Chest.

We advocate the continuation of the
Jazz Festival and we hope that the stu-
dent body will seriously consider the
question involved in discontinuing such
a dynamic event.

[would like to move that there be a com-
munications problem to enforce this hy-
pothesis.

The problem should center around the
fact that the ASP does not publish enough
notices, and that Communications Com-
mission, which has never received sug-
gestions for any action, also be one of
the major causes.

That the top governmental brass can-
not communicate within themselves is of
no concern; in fact, it makes govern-
ment more interesting — what with all
the surprises. v

Additionally, we make a plea that all
commissions continue to war within them-
selves over who receives the least co-
operation and who does the most to co-
operate. We feel that if commissions
start realizing their full potential to be
Ito-cooperative truly forward advances
could be made.

We further suggest that all branches
begin by denying all attempts to get to
the nitty~gritty of an issue and con-

Visiting Scholar Explains

Parking Rationale
by Peter Clvordi

The true rationale for the park-
ing procedure on this campus
was discovered this week by a
visiting scholar from another
branch of the State University
System. The scholar put the park-
ing regulations into such a clear
perspective that only a fool could
fail to realize the humanitarian
interests which have motivated
this University.

He has been kind enough to
put the rationale in layman's
terms:

“A parking registration fee
of forty cents is collected from
each student, faculty, and em-
ploye who desires to park on
campus. After the fee is paid a
parking permit is issued that
allows people connected with the
university to park in a space
which is calculated to reﬂect
their importance. This bothers
the majority of university peo-
ple. The faculty feels their posi-
tion Iustifles an exemption from
such a fee. Employee feel that
it is the employers responsibility
to provide parking space for
them free of charge. The stu-
dents. who are in the technical
position of employer, feel that
Albany State is their campus
and that an owner should not be
put in the confusing position of
renting space which he ultimater
owns.

Faculty, students. and em-
ployee should stop complaining
and realize that everyone must
do his fair share for humanity
grind. the economy of the United

a as.

That forty cent fee creates
,lobs for-the school personnel who

. are sent out tothe parkiuiotsv-

to see that everyone has paid
his forty cent fee. Those who
have not paid the required fee,

or have parked in a space deem-
ed inappropriate to their station,
are ticketed. Ticketing then
creates more employment for
those little old ladies In the
Business Office who are employ-
ed to deal. almost exclusively
with parking violations.

The increased employment
thus generated creates an in-
crease in demand for consumer
products throughout the country.
The increased demand for con-
sumer products again increases
employment through the econo-
mic phenomena of the “multi-
plier effect." In fact, thegovern-
ing body regulating traffic pro-
cedure on campus has a signifi-
cant stabilizing effsct on the
entire economy by helping it
reach its goals of full employ-
ment and potential Gross National
Product.

Sonow it becomes clear that
the traffic regulations are not
so arbitrary as they would seem.
0n the contrary, Albany State
15 (10108 more than its fair Show
for your country.

Some cynica, such as those
of the "new economics” school
will dispute this proosdure. They
feel that economic stability
should be had through automatic
stabilizers in the federalgovorn-
ment such as taxes, farm sun-
sidies, personal and corporate
savings, etc., and through dis-
cretionary fiscal policy. The
Ol'ncis are irresponsible. Why
should an economic goal as im-
portant as stability be left to

ment when Albany State can in-

lSRAELlS, mass
0 AND” THE REST or us

&

eading "The New York
Times” can beavery dishearten-
ing experience. For the past
week, that stalwart journal has
reported on young King Hussein's
worldwide whistlestop tour and it
has breathlessly informed the
waiting world that the King has
made the startling confession that
Israel does exist and might even
continue to do so (at Arab suf-
ferenace of course). It seems like
a good part of the international
community is at Israel's throat
.for daring to assert that she, as
the victor in a war she did not
want and struggled to prevent,
might have some say in the mak-

ing of the terms for peace.

One can only be astounded at
the audacity of the rest of the
world in calling for unconditional
Israeli withdrawal from any of
the territory she captured during
those six days last June. This
seems to be part of a recurrent
pattern In recent Jewish history.
The "civilized" world relaxed
and allowed the liquidation of six
million Jews less than thirty

.years ago. The "heroes" of the
last generation, Churchill and
Roosevelt, were strongly silent
and were seamineg little offend-
ed nt Ilitler's handling of the
Jewish question. One must
suppose that the restoration of
the Jewish question in Palestine
was a product of German har-
barism and Western shame. But
in any case, the British and their
camel-backed cohorts did aIIthoy
could to destory the fledgling
Jewish state but Israel fought
along, as she always has, and

.she won. But she did not win her
security. She has had to endure
incessant Arab attack for the
mist twonty years. She quietly
out up with the constant Arab
forays across her border; the
“Will and vicious attacks upon
frontier kibbutzim was a part of
Israeli national life since the
l"Winning. Israel has been balanc-
lns precariousiy on the razor's
“die of existence.

Nasser has said time and again
that the "Arab national aim is

, .iho elimination of Israeli." This

Year Nasaol' tightened the noose,

closed internationalswaters to-

Israeli shipping and for a few
sickening days swaggeringly en-
joyed the victory he had won by
default. The world saw the Arabs
Iusiily wave their swords at the
idea of destroying Tel-Aviv' and
driving the Jews into the sea.
But the world quickly forgot Auch-
witz and Dachau and there was
only silence. Then came the war
and in a few hours two and a half
million sons and daughters ofths
concentration camp held back one
hundred million causoless Arabs.
England and America breathed a
sigh of relief. Their silence was
now called“diplomacy" and their
spinelessness was called "pre-
serving world peace."

Now these same governments
are no longer silent. They call for
Israel to withdraw from those
deserts formerly Arab held. They
call for the internationalization
of Jerusalem; a city that now for
the first time Is open to men of
every faith. The Arabs ofJeru-
salem were granted citizenship
and as anyone knows 151 soil

ties afar higher standard of living
than he could hope to have in any
Arab state save Kuwait. One sees
the Israelis in victory and can
only shudder at the thought of what
the Arabs planned to do had they
won the war and occupied Israel.

Israel's attitude towards
negotiation is more magnanimous
than anyone had a right to expect.
She rightfully scoffs at any de-
mands for unconditional with-
drawal. The Arabs began the war
and lost, and now they insist that
Israel withdraw to the Armistice
lines they tried to obliterate.
Typical Arab logic, but this time
it won". work. Israel can now
negotiate from a position of
strength. And she can do itulone.
And long last she knows that a
Jewish nation can expect no help
from any quarter, leastawaysthe
United States under Johnson's
stewardship. She did not fight
that war only to go back to the
intolerable situation that existed
prior to June sixth. She shall

ALBANY STUDENT cars

by Stuart Solomon

While working as s VISTA in
New Mexico, I became aware of
two distinct approaches for help-
iw people get out ofpovorty.'l'ho
first is what I call the positive
approach —- this has been Martin
Luther King's method as well as
the guiditg philosophy for OEO.

‘ The principle here is to assume

that the powers-to-be are oner
side and that they will do their
share when they understand the
problems at hand. It may take per-
suasion and at times coersion,
but with enough patience the
power structure will eventually
come around. In Eaton, we found
this to be a workable philosophy
—- people were friendly, although
naive.

A big advantage of the positive
approach is that the VISTA, or
any organizer, stands in sym-
pathy with the low-income people
he is helping as well as with the
power structure that has the
funds, services and organization
to do the helping. If the VISTA
is able to stay on good footingwith
both sides his success will be
seen in how much closer the two
classes come to understanding

AAUP Denounces
Hershey Statement

WASHINGTON (CPS) — The
American Association of Univer-
sity Professors hasstronglypro-
tested a directive by Selective
Service Director Lewis B, Her-
shey that persons involvedln dis-
ruptive antiwar protests should
be drafted first.

AAUP president Clark Byse,
a professor at the Harvard Uni-
versity Law School, and Dr. Ber-
tram H, Davis, AAUP's general
secretary, sent a telegram to
Hershey protesting the directive
as it may affect college and
university teachers and students.

Hershey’s statement regard-
ing the protestors was made in
a letter sent to all members
of the Selective Service Sys-
tem. The letter referred to per-
sons who protest the war and
the draft by disrupting army in-
duction centers or keeping mili-
tary recruiters from conducting
interviews.

The AAUP said Hershey has
set forth a standard which would
permit local boards to induct
persons for exercising their
constitutionally guaranteedfree~
doms of speech and assembly.
"The more existence of this un-
defined power to use the draft
as a punitive instrument must
therefore have a chilling effect
upon academic freedom and
free speech and assembly as
guaranteed by the First Amend-
ment."

The telegram also said the
conduct of some members of the
academic community may be pun-
ishable under existing legal or
institutional procedures and that
the further use of the Selective
Service as a punishment vio-
lates traditional American due
process guarantees and is ini-
micai to the national interest.

"We do not believe that your
letter serves the national inter-

est, and we urge that it be
promptly rescinded," the tele-
gram said.

 

COMMUNICATIONS
COMMISSION

Communications Commis-
sion is presently seeking in-
formation from anyone in the
University Community who
has information they feel por-
tineni to a manual presently
under compiliation.

This manual is designed to
help make known necessary
procedures In securing the
services now available in the
University.

Information of this sort
would include places at which
to leave material to be pub-
licized, and information on
how the student could obtain
such available materials as

most often power structures that
are either actively indifferent or
overtly hostile to the needs of the
low-income community. The city

of this. in situations like these,
the VISTA would be foolish totry

to act as a liason; here he must '

devote his efforts to organizing
and teaching the poor the reality
of militant resistance. This is the
logic of Black Power. A certain
number of Negroes is tired of
looking for friends; they rather
turn to organizing their own oom-
munItiss in the hope of producing
political power blocs that have to
be dealt with.

Negative organizing is always
accompanied by a literature of
paranoia and persecution. It has

depends onthepsrticularcircum-
stances. The organiser must
choose which approach will
facilitate the goals of the com-
munity he is working in. Many
people have criticized VISTA and
0130 for being too partial to the
positive approach, but what other
position can they take. Imagine
the uproar if the Federal govern-
ment funded SNCC or evenCORE?
The trouble with each approach
is that in positive organizing the
VISTA has to sacrifice certain
goals in order to stay unfriendly
terms with the power structure,
while in negative organizing the
VISTA has to realize that he may
sacrifice the middle-class con-
cessions (like Headstart funding)
for the sake of solidarity. Prob-
ably the criterion in choosing an
approach is whether the organiz-
er is content in achieving actual,
immediate gains or rather hopes
to achieve greater change some-
where in the future.

   

 

 
 

 
   
    
  

M yskania Abandons Plans
To Become Judicial Body

'by Roy McCloot
Chairman pl Myskonia

After several weeks of deli-
beration and debate, MYSKANIA
has decided that its future role
shall be that of a student sound-
ing body that shall at all times
keep itself and the university
aware of "future needs" and
problems of the student body.

MYSKANIA had previously an-
nounced that it was considering
assuming the judicial role of the
student government, but after
learning that a fallacy existed
about Supreme Court being in-
operative, MYSKANIA recon-
sidered its previous decision.

Although no formal statement
has been issued as yet,
MYSKANIA chairman Ray Mc-
Cloat expounded MYSKANIA's
views at a special session of
Central Council, Supreme court,
and MYSKANIA on Thursday,
Nov. 9.

He said that MYSKANIA has
for a long time been concerned
with its role on campus, as the
honorary hass been severely
affected by the transition and
rapid growth of Albany. In trying

find a role suitable to the
background and composition of
M YSKANIA, it was decidedthat by
fully devoting its efforts toward
a meaningful interpretation of

Article V, section, 2, letter c of
the SA constitution, MYSKANIA
could best serve a broad and
responsible role on campus.
That section of the constitution
reads under the the duties of
MYSKANIA: "To act in concert
with the Central Council and the
University in contemplating
future needs ofthe student body."
McCloat also said, “By becom-
ing a responsible student sound-
board, MYSKANIA hopes to
act as a resprssentatlve body that
will be concerned with and react
to the needs of the student com-
munity.'«,
“In this capacity," he added,
"we hope to fully utilize the ex-
perience and university involve-

ment that MYSKANIA members"

represent in providing the school
with a body dedicated to keeping
university policies and student
opinions in view.

 

 

The ASP will begin soon to
raise money for
its foster child.
