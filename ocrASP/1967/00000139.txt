primarily in the political "news"

of distortion — this time through

But most of all, it is an insult
to the ASP's readers.

My intentions in writing this
letter were to let those who have
not had a chance to "keep an
eye on the ASP” as long asl
have know my opinions. The ASP
is not a bible or guiding light
to a majority of State students;
it is not representative of stu-
dent opinions, and its "news"
articles should be read skeptical-
ly and with a critical mind.

Thank you for the soapbox.

A n I nsul!

To the Editor:

While I would be among the
first to admit that the ASP has
made a definite change for the
better since last year, I fail
to understand why an arts sec-
tion that is “an insult to the
readers intelligence" has been
retained. This portion of the
paper constitutes a clutter of
trivia, gossip, and conjecture.
True there are many worthwhile
artic es concerning campus
events, but the arts section's
usefulness ends there. It is when
certain contributors attempt to
rival the New York Times in na-
tional arts coverage, that I ob-
ject as a reader.

To mention a few cases in
point, let us begin with Mr,
Cuity's TV roviews.Whetherthie
is art or not, remains a person-

The “Directory” is an improve-
ment over last year‘s in many
wa s.

The omission‘ of commuter
telephone numbers is less than
desirable, but according to the
"Directory" a large percentage
of com muting students do not even
attend this University. This is
an even more difficult problem
to solve.

How does a person find the
right Smith in a city directory
if they don't even have an ad-
dress to help? It is my hope,
also, that future "Directories"
will correct these oversights.

Rosemary Thomson

I ndid ment

To the Editor: ,

I have been reading your paper
avidly this year and am greatly
impressed by the ASP’s new role
as a real newspaper.

One thing l have found
particularly disturbing, however,
is the fact that each week the
paper reads like an indictment:
“How can you do nothing when
people are starving in India, liv-
ing poverty in Appalachia and
Harlem, being asked to fight for
a war they don't believe in, etc?
Why are you so selfish?"

I would like to take my stand
for selfishness; for selfishness
which recognizes the self as the
only thing which the individual
ever really possesses, as the
essence of the individual, the
sacrifice of which(selfsucrifico,
selfishness) imples a form of
suicide.

What is wrongwith doing things
for others because one really de-
rives a selfish pleasure, a satis-
faction of self, from doing them
rather then constantly consider.
ing them as socially obligatory
(or ideologically obligatory)?

What is so terrible about the
man who, through quiet intro-
spection, seeks to achieve a union
with a greater, unusual self; a
man who views the processes of
life and death in an individual as
of primarily individual concern?

When the battle troops return
from the wars where they have
been "doing their hit for man-
kind" and the protesters have re-
turned from the Pentagons after

. "doing their. hit humankind."
and the activists hays returned

Now, concerning my review
of the American String Trio —
I was not pleased with the con-

- cert. Whether or not the String

Trio has reached "the top of/"

their profession” is Miss King’s
opinion, which is no more valid
than mine. Now as far as bodily
movements are conceri "HI feel
that this is a very important
part of the performance. It is
very unnecessary to bend and
move all over the place for the
production of good tone and inter-
pretation. It is unnecessary, hin~
dering, distracting and all in all
damn poor Showmanship. lap-
ply this to the violin and the
two singers who bent and mov-
ed excessively (this is what I
meant by their seeming to have
internal difficulty). If Miss King
is a music major, she should
realize this herself, and if she
is interested in the "school"
here - it's French.

My interest is in reporting
what I feel, according to my
standards of performance, which
have been developed by some
highly competent music men-
tors (probably as distinguished
as she has encountered). I am
not interested in slamming any—
one or any department, so there-
fore I ask for her respect and
consideration of what I have to
say in the future. Undoubtedlyl
deserve and should have criti-
cism, but not nasty, cutting crit—
icism such as she had to offer.
I assure her that I am working
to Improve what I say and the
way I may say it, but I have
my basic tenets which I hold
strongly, and they are not the
result of "ignorance."

Two New Exhibits Planned
For Fine Arts Gallery

by Gail Sailon

The Art Gallery in the Fine
Arts Building will reopen De-
cember 7 with two new exhibits:
Australian Paintings, and a se-
lection of oils and serigraphs by
Jack Bosson, of the University
Art Department faculty.

The Australian exhibit will In-
clude 75 contemporary Artists
from "Down Under" from the
Maria Collection, entitled THE
AUSTRALIAN PAINTERS: 1904-
1966. Sponsored by the Mertz
Art Fund, Port Washington, N.Y.,
the exhibition is being circulat-
ed throughoui the United States
under the auspices of The Amer-
ican Federation of Arts.

program which Included Tell.»

J.S. Bach suite in C minor, all
for flute and harpslcord; there
were also Poulenc and Bartok
pieces arranged for flute and pi—

to piano added textural variety
to the program and Veyron-l.u~

keyboard as the composer had
originally intended.

The Mozart sonatas were per-

of the gallant style. (Mozart was

this piece). As in the Telemann

annual student-talent, musical-

name each year.

Friday and Saturday nights, under
the joint direction of two very

people, Carol Rosenthaiand Ellis
Kaufman.

the entire show. Isn’t it amaZing
how some people can be so
foolishly, absurdly, stupidly in-
correct? ‘

Thoroughly Entertainod

For, in fact, [was thoroughly
entertained by Sideshow and will
pursue a policy in the remainder
of this column of trying to re-
strain myself from bursting into
wildly over-enthusiastic raves.

There was asurprisinglylarge
total of four dancers in the show,
and all were quite competent.
Joy Couchman danced lnthe style
of modern dance to "Life Goes
Cu" from the motion picture
score of “Zorba the Greek."

It was wonderfully executed
and Miss Couchman was very
moving, dancing with a quiet,
gentle dignity that summed up
so well the meaning inherent in
the words “life goes on."

Kathy Kelly, cooly precise in
a lap dance choreographed to the
song "Ev'ry Night at Seven,”
was slightly awkward Friday
night but much more polished on
Saturday. Kathy O’Neil’s talents
were displayed inHComputer in
Love,” a joyoust synchronized
number that was both delightfully
amusing and insinuatingly sexual.

Diana De Rosa, performing
what was billed as a "Dance and
Twirl," made professional use
of the baton in her dance. Trooper

  tertaining By

 

that she was, when she dropped
her baton once each night during
a terribly difficult baton twirl,
she picked it up immediately and
continued her. dance with double
her former amount of energy.
Female Vocalists

There were three female vocal-
ist (excluding the folk-singing
group). Lia Petkanas possesses
a rich, deep voice which, on Fri-
day night, was lost in the high-
note region. But, on Saturday,
she performed with much strong-
er vocal control.

Theresa Mercurio brought
tears to my eyes (figuratively
speaking, of course, and please
forgive the cliche) with her soul-
ful, mourning rendition of "To
Sir, With Love." Iler throbbing,
sexy voice added warmth and
color to Dennis Buck's admir-
able, but difficult arrangement
of the popular film song.

Linda Sherry's magnificent
rendition of "As Long As He
Needs Me” from "Oliver" sent
shivers up the collective spine
of a greatly thrilled and pleased
audience. It was a brilliant tour-
de-force, rising to a greatly excit-
ing peak of emotion.

The folk-singers were avaried
lot. Andy Sells and Bob Pate per-
formed an original song by the
former, “Bells of Constant
Time." Though I felt the song
itself was badly written, I was

impressed with both Sells
singing voice and musical
arrangement.

Barbara Dayer, singing “Ate'
Amanha," has a lovely voice
with a lilting, lyrical quality,
but at both performances her
singing was marred by frighten-
ingly obvious stage. fright.

Neil Linden can do to a guitar
what Dennis Buck does to a
piano: Linden, a virtuoso guitar-
ist, was a delight to listen to in
his humorous, twanging version
of "Windv and Warm."

song at’ell. Miss Seaman has a
beautiful voice, but not until
Saturday did she accompany her
song with either dramatic intensi-
ty or emotional projection.

One. main virtue of John- P.’

Harrison III is that he is such a
talented folk-song writer. His
vast degree ofpersoaalinvolve-
ment in his material makes his
act almost totally impervious to
critical disapproval; \his per-
formance could only be describ-
ed as perfect.

Judi Ann Wiesen’s rendition of
“I'm the Greatest Star" from
the musical "Funny Girl" was
one of the funniest comedy num-
bers I have ever been treated
to. A versatile personality, Miss
Wiesen’s singing and acting was
so forceful and vigorous that the
resultant cheers of applause had
to be choked off by the announce-
ment of the next performer.

Gary Aldrich was properly
masculine in his handling of
"Summertime," "It's Ain't
Necessarily So," and "I Got
Plenty of Nothin' " from "Porgy
and Bess." His strong, dominat-
ing voice was, however, at
several points during his per-
formance, accompanied by point-
less over-gesturing, which was

terribly distracting from his
songs.
‘Golden Oldies'

In the "Golden Oldies" section
Diane Somerville and John Webb,
the co-directors of last year's
All - University Reception,
CAROUSEL '66, performed their
show-stoppers from last year's
production. Miss Somerville exe-
cuted an outrageoust funny strip-
tease that had the audience
screamina for more.

Webb, however, brought down
the house, especially on Satur-
day, with his surprisingly suc-
cessful comedy interpretations
of "Tiptoe Thru the Tulips" and
"Grandma's Lye Soap." The
tears that gushed from the eyes
of those who witnessed this act
were tears not of sentimental
joy but, rather, of exhausted
appreciation.

Webb also doubled as musical
director for SIDESHOW and he
performed quite handsomely in
this function. Dennis Buck also
held a dual capacity; musical

This picture also captures some

One thing that disappointed me
about the exhibit is its small-
ness (aside from the fact that
three of the pictures have been
stolen). When I first went to see
the photos, I wasn't sure that it
was up yet since it's on only two
of these white panels on theright
side of the doorway to the upper
lounge. The last exhibit was at
least twice as large.

less noteworthy: the one of draft
