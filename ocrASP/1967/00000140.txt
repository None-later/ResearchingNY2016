"Once upon a time there was
born a man who had no illusions
about anything." Withsimplieity,
gentle wit, and an air of table,
this openim narration of John
Korty’s “Crazy Quilt" (Cinema
Art Theatre) sets the tone for
the entire film. The idea is
from a story called "The ll-
lusionless Man and thsVisiomry
Maid,” which really tells the
what: ﬂung.

Korty sums it up clnematical-
ly in one striking shot: Lora.-
belle skipping along the top of
a wall, a windmill in the dis-
tance, with Henry plodding stiff-
ly along on the ground below. But
the issue of the film is complex:
although Korty likes the ideal-
istic Lorabelle, he sides with
Henry in viewing life as a ser-
ies of bleak disappointments and
discouragements. As much as a
Lorabelle can brighten life mo-
mentarily, one must cling to
dreams only because there is
nothing else.

Interest In People

Paradoxically, Korty has suf.
fused this despairtn outline in
delicate imagery t t reson-
ates with an interest in people.
He has a gift for creating im-
ages of fragile charm: a tonsi-
ed bed in the sunlight, a porch
swing, a cake shaped like a ter-
mite. Korty's camera works mag-
ic with air and light, showing
us the textures and slants of
everyday objects in fresh ways.

The comparison of this film
with "A Man and a Woman" is
unavoidable. “Crazy Quilt" is
as modest and light on its feet
as "A Man and a Woman" is
pretentious and plodding. Korty
wastes not a second: every in.
stant he is startling, showing,
urging us into a work in which
word andimage chimewitha love-
ly economy Lelouch never ap-
proaches.

Not for Korty the soap-opera
banaliti‘es of Lelouch's dialogue;
his writing has bite, his charac-
ters are surprising in convinc-
ing ways. His people inhabit a
world recognizably our own; Le-
louch's characters move in (a
never-never land of postcard
prettlness and Pepsi-Generation
fantasy. Korty's scenes are rich,
packed with auusion; Lelouch's
rarely get beyond stagy prelim.
inaries. in short. i think, it
comes down to.thls: Korty has a
unique personal vision of life,
Le'louch only the cliches of won.

fiction.
Net Without Faults

Not tlat the aim is wittmd
faults. At times Burgess Mers-
dtth's usually crackling narra-
tion verges on the cute, and Pet-
er Shiekele's eclectic score does
not a him which tends
toward t episodic. Also. lbs-
came a little tired othersbelle's
succession of lovers! it seem-
ed that, for all their richness
.as vignettes these characters
intruded a litlle.

 

But better a surplus of inven-
tion tlun a shortage. The movie
brims with moments of drench-
ing beauty — not merely a bean-
ty of landscapes and sunsets, but
one infused with a wonder at the
mysteries of human nature, so
that the ending takes you by sure
prise, just quietly closing on a
note oi ‘ suppressed sadness.
"Crazy Quilt" is an outstand-
ing film; it deserves much wider
distribution.

EastmanEnsemble
To Give Concert
Sunday In Page

Music Council will present The
“Eastman Wind Ensemble" in a
special concert Sunday afternoon,
November 19, at 3:30 p.m. in
Page Hall.

The “Eastman Wind Ensemble,
under the direction of Donald
Hunsberger, was the first sym-
phonic wind ensemble to be es-
tablished in the United States.
Formed in 1953 under a totally
new concept, they stress orches-
tral style in performance, utter
faithfulness to the composer's
wishes, and emphasis on the in-
dividual performer both in his
own right and as part of the whole.

Not a band in the traditional
sense of the word, the Ensemble
is a concert organization whose
programs are based on original
music for the winds instead of
transcripuons of orchestral
music.

By providing the composer with .
a concert medium as distinctive
as that oi the string orchestra,
the Ensemble has stimulated the
composition oi several substan.
tial works by leading composers
in the United States and else-
where. A new series oi publica-
tions for wind ensemble has also
grown out oi the "Eastman Wind
Ensemble's" activities.

With a group oi 50 superb
musicians, the "Eastman Wind
Ensemble" repertory ranges
from works for small groups
by Mozart and the Gabrielle, to
the symphonies oi Hindemith,
Hovaness and Perschetti.

Their concert Sunday will in.
clude Robert Washburn's "Sym-
phony for Wind Band,” Kabalev-
sky's "Overture to Coins Broug-
non," "An Original Suite" by
Gordon Jacob, and a group of-
internationsl marshes.

Fourth Time/l round

by Igor Koroluk

Much of the West Coast music
we have been hearing lately is
on some nebulous quality scale
between goodand mediocre. Since
L.A. and San Francisco have be-
come the new music centers of
the country, just about any group
can get enough push to get a
record on the charts. .

Generally, the groups aren't
bad, in fact each one seems to
have anew idea oi how to approach
rock with a fresh sound.

The trouble is that they are re-‘

cording too early before they
have developed enough profes-
sionalism to get a good tight
sound.

On the other hand, there is a

Seeger To Play,
Sing In Concert
At Glens Falls

Pete Seeger, famed folkstnger,
will give a concert at the Glens
Falls High School Auditorium, on
November 21, at 8 p.m., sponsor-
ed by the Hudson River Sloop
Restoration, Inc., in association
with the Hudson Valley Singers.

Pete Seeger has just returned
from a concert tour of Japan and
in September appeared on The
Smothers Brothers CBSJI‘V pro-
gram.

Jack Gould of the New York
Times recently wrote that Pete
Seeger is a "giant oi the modern
cultural scene," "a supreme ar-
tist," “a composer oi distinc-
tion, and the real father of the
folk music movement.”

in the 1960's, Seeger organized
a singing group called The Weav-
ers that broke the trail for such
folk groups as the Kingston Trio
and Peter, Paul, and Mary. They
sold over, 4,000,000 records be-
fore Pete left the group in 1957.

Pete Seeger also is the author
or coauthor of such hits as "Turn,
Turn, Turn " “Kisses Sweeter
Than Wine," "Where Have All
the Flowers Gone?" and "iii
had a Hammer." He presently
records for Columbia Records
and his latest album is “Waist
Deep in the Big Muddy and other
Love Songs."

Since Pete Seeger concerts are
usually sold-out in advance, it is
suggested that tickets be pur-
chased onrly. Tickets for the
concert are available at the Van
Curler Music Store in Albany,
Triad Music Center in Glens
Falls, Blue Jack Music Store
in Glens Falls, M usic tn
Ballston Spa, Cafe in Sar-
MORI and the Vic ct Bar-
ber shop in Granville; ew York.

The price is $2.50. Mail orders

group from San Francisco which
has all these good qualities, in-
cluding originality with a good
tight sound, but has not drawn
the popular appeal which the
lesser organizations have.
"Country Joe and the Fish" is
its name and album (Vanguard).

“Not So Sweet Martha Lor-
raine," the first single by the
group, Was released this sum-
mer. It never did fly high,
mainly due to its non-commer-
cial sound. This song takes its-
tening, a quality the 45 rpm
buying leeny-boppin' crowd is
not noted to possess. With no
catching tune, repetitive lyrics,
or "Dit-di-dit-dit," it sank away
in about a week, Albany time.

Frankly, it's a good thing they
did not catch on because of their
music would have been wasted.
They are an album group and
they belong with people who take
the time and have the intelli.
gence to listen, feel and under-
s .

The group centers about Joe
McDonald, their prolific song-
writer (music and lyrics) and
vocalist (also guitar, bells, and
tambprine). Hts tunes range from
the bittingsatireof “Super bird":
"Look up yonder in the skyl
What is that I pray?
it's a bird, it’s a plane.
it's a man insane!
it's my President LBJ.”
through the pleading sensuality
of “Love” to the haunting beauty
of “Bass Strings."

Unlike too many groups, the
burden does not fail on McDonald
to carry the group because all
the members are excellent and
imaginative instruwaamllsts, es—
pecially David Col- se lead
guitar and organ can easily chal-
lenge any WestCoaster. His play-
ing is characterized by amelodic
quality with long drawn out lines
instead of the common rythmic
sound, forming a constant under-
current to the immediate music
pattern.

Like Cohen, Chicken Hirsh
seems to be carryingn melodic
pattern on his drums. Finding
the beat unessential, he, instead,
helps creatively to find the tune.
in actuality every member of
the group, which also includes
Barry Melton (vocals, guitar)
and Bruce Barthel Glass, har-
monica), seems to have some-
thing special to give to enhance
the total song.‘

The group has not given up
in the money market yet and is
releasing another single,
“Janis " and an album, “i Feel
Like i m Fixin' To Die," later
this month. if “Janis” ever
reaches the local radio area
(try WBZ ln Boston first) give
a listen—a close one—if their
previous works are any indies,
tion of what to expect. You may
be pleasantly surprised by the
sounds of what i consider the
best of the West Coast and one
of the best and most creative
rock groups anywhere.

it will be up to you, my
readers, to decide on the final
outcome. .

First of all l'm glad that Nicho-
las and Ida agreeononethtngr
that the students of this univer-
sity deserve the best they can
get. The fact that he was able
to make that statement leads me
to believe that he does realize
that many of the activities now
on the books are virtually worth-
less to the university community.
I'm also glad that he recognizes
the existence of journalistic re-
liability. Realize that this re-
liability also applies to my source
of information. But since he
deems himself such an expert
on "channels of' information,"
my realiability has come into
question.

Info On Board

1 was able to get my infor-
mation on Special Events Board
and its proposals from one who
is on the board at the present
time. i consider this to be per-
fectly ethical since the workings
of our government are open to
all scrutiny by the students.

As far as the report of the
co-chalrmen is concerned, well
why not air all sides? As Nicho-
las said, i did tell him that 1
would get the report to him
soon. i also asked him when
the report was needed. His ans—
wer to this statement was,“Don't
worry about it, Lou. We won't
need it until September or Oct-
ober." lreemphastzed the need

the Board something to work

ed, ! feel we will find‘the answer

the popularity of Parent's Week.

This issue has reached the
extremes of sarcasm and imma-
turity. 1 fully apologize to my
readers for having to be exposed
to it. My point is that there have
been too many implications and
counter-implications to let this
matter go any further without
full exploitation. i do promise
that this column will never again
be used for the purposes of re-

bear with me.

Cz' mom [I

by Roy Stormon

 

 

in this rather saccharine ver-
sion of “Blackboard Jungle,"
Sidney Poitier plays an African-
English teacher assigned to a
slum high school in London. His
students, ill-mannered, semi-
illiterate, and dressed in typi-
cally “mod” and hippie styles

are taught all about the facts-

of life instead of the usual high
school curriculum. . .Poitier ul-
timately turns them all into good
citizens and decides to continue
on as father figure at London’s
Harrison High. .

The entire film is one long
sentimental outburst about young
[)euyie who are led out of the
darkness and into the light by
a strict but understanding
teacher. Mostly because of its
sentimentality, the film lac
any proximity to reality, and its
Poitlor's unorthodox teaching
methods are to contrived to
be believed. in fact, even with
a few racial threats whispered
here and there with other talk
of inter-marriage between Pol-
tler and one of his more attrac-
tive female students, the film
is still so bland and pleasing
that no genuine issues of race,
education, or sex are anywhere
seriously discussed.

Poitier himself emerges as a
good-guy who has no real life
except his teaching duties which
only further exaggerates his
stereotype image. He does with
the role what he can, and his
genuine noting talents m
to come through despite the trite-

ness of the script. Poitier as
a character in the plot of the
film is so elevated that he is
faultless and appears as a cart-
cature of the perfect high school
teacher. As a Negro actor, his
portrayal may make for better
race relations, but such a com.
mertcal and pollyanna picture

makes only for bad art.

In spots, some of the camera
work is good. A class trip to
a London museum provides a.
good background for a sequence
of quick motion shots showinga
student sitting on a stone lion
and then switching immediately
to another shot of a group of
students mugging with an Egyp.
tian statue and then switching
again to other scenes. This.
Beatlesque clowning is cute up
to a point, but the Beatles them-
selves -or the Marx Brothers
could have made it much more
effective.

i don't like to sound preteni
tious, but Poitier is one of the
more “important” actors in
American films today, am, asan
actor and artist, he would con-
tribute more to movies in gen-
eral if he would stay away from
doing trite and worthless drivel
such as this film.

tunity to demonstrate his com-
mand over the entire range of
the flute, both the rich tones of
the lower register and the more
difficult high notes. His supreme
tongulng of the fast passage and
lightly tossed off phrases added
to the gaiety of Poulenc's sonata.

The Bartok suite was originally
written for violin and piano and
seemed little fitting for a flute
and piano duo.

realize that Mr. Kshn knows no
more about the intricacies of
jazz and jazz performers than
1 know of the intricacies of nu-
clear physics.

Despite the fact that he was'
at one time the chairman of
Contemporary Music Council.
nevertheless, he hasnever shown
himself toka anything, about
any music, let alone jazz. He
proved ittome whenheslso
'moved that Louis Armstrongbe
contracted to play at thefestival.
Now, for the present, let's dis-
regard the fact that it's louie
that we are talking about. Rather
let's look at the other points.

Over Telephone

First of all both of these mo-
tions were pul to the board and
approved over the telephone.Sec-
ondly, the chairmen of the festi-
val have not yet been picked
(the sore spot again). Thirdly,
presuming that the people chosen
to chair the festival are know-
ledgeable (Heaven help me if
they aren't), imagine the hind-
rances they will have to put
up with by being subject to a
person who knows nothing of
the music, and what is even
worse, is pushing his own event
the very same weekend.

Truly, we are bordering on
the insane if for a minute we
can imagine that either of the
events will be a success. We
have just gone through one ex-
perience resulting from this type
of zeal. Do we have to travel
the same path twice?

Then there is the point of
contracting Satchmo. He is go-
ing to cost the student body
$6,000. This will leave the Jazz
Festival with $4,000 in its bud-
get (that's right, this is coming
out of the J.F. budget and the
chairmen. . .). What other per-
formers can the chairmen pos-
sibly hire with the remaining
money that would even come
near the quantity and the amaz-
ing quality that last year's fes-
tival had? (Remember that each
guest artist at last year's fes-
tival was a winner of a Critic's
Poll.) Louie may have been con-
sidered the best in his time,
but there are many who are
better now. if they could hire
him and still have as much as
there was last year, then i
could see it. But for $0,000?

Final Point

This leads us to the final
point of this article. Page three
contains a. story concerning this
entire fiasco. The gist of the
story is that Special Events Board
is going to conduct a poll “this
month" to gauge student opin-
ions on jazz. Evidently, this
will determine whether the stu-
dents really want a jazz festival
or not. Well, l'd like to take
this further. Also on page three,
there is an ASP Student Acti-
vities Poll that is gauging stu-
dent opinion on all campus events,
not just jazz. Maybe we can do
away with much of the unneces-
sary events that now clutter up
the calendar, like Parents' Week.
and. l urge you all to answer
the questions on the poll and re-
turn tt to the ASP through Cam-
pus Mail (it's free), or drop it
in the ASP notice has at the
information desk in the campus
Center. this will be one of the
few chances you will have to de-
termine what type of entertain
meat you will have on our cunpus.
The results of the poll will be
published in the ASP. Let's just
hope that the government we
elected will listen to What its
employers have to say.
