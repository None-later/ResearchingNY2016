Shustak To Lecture
0n Phowgraphy

Larence N. shustak, instructor
in photography at the Staten is-
land institute of and
Sciences, will speak and show
parts oi _his neitest though un-
finished film, Monday, November
20,, 8 p.m., Fine Arts Building
Gallery Lounge. This lecture,

cred by the Arts council,
will also include a showing of
some of Shustak's still photo-
graphic works.

Shustak has had his work ex-
hibited at the George Eastman
House and in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in-New York City
among other places. The Eastman
House ' and the University of
Minnesota Art Gallery own
collections of his work and he
received a Certificate of Ex-
cellence from the American in-
stitute of Graphic Arts.

Shustak sees photography as a
means ofpersonal expressionand
has been making photography
such for the last 11 years. One
of his projects has been to make
available to individuals small
portfolios of original prints at
reasonable prices.

At present he indicated that he
is "concerned with new visual
realities arising out oi familiar
situations and sights, as a con-
tinuing series of graffiti." To
him, moreover, all subject
matter is equal.

He lists as photographers who
have inﬂuenced him most,
Eugene Atget, Alfred Stieglitz
and Bill Brandt. He feels that

Cafe Lena Program
To Feature Webb

by John Liptnon
The Cafe Lena in Saratoga is

one of the better places to escape »

to on Friday, Saturday or Sunday
evening and leave all your
thoughts of Albany behind.

The easiest way to get there
is to take the Northway to Exit
GP and then ask for Philia Street
and or the Cafe Lena.

Shows at the Cafe start at
8:30 or 9 p.m. depending on the
popularity of the performer and
go 'til 10 or 1, with two breaks.
This weekend Pat. Webb is the
feature performer.

in appearance, the Lena lslike
all other coffee houses; it’s kind
of dark and dim, but putting all
that aside, it's a nice place to
visit. Fred and Dennis (no last
names available as we go to
press) run the leather shop in
the adjacent room.

Lena, who looks a little like
an old indian sauaw, has been
running the cafe for seven years
now. Lena's is not strictly a folk
music safe, but the entertainment
is basically folk oriented.

Lens has had Ario Guthrie,
the Green Brier Boys and Niel
Linden, Michael Cooney, Lewis
Killen, Rosalie Sorrells, Bar-
bara Karns, the Penny Whistlers
and other various and sundry
performers. if you can make it
up there, it’s a good place to go.

voted to breaking the pattern of accepted theatre practices.

By changing even the typical seating arrangement,
Frankonis feels'that the audience will be farced to ob-
serve the play differently than it would a standard per-
formance. His cgst, Beth Sabowitz and Jay Kuperman, will
emphasize this aspect by their attitude and response to
the spectator. .

Buck's Number

The thunderous applause that
greeted Buck’s number each night
is clear proof of a simple fact:
for the second year in a row,
Dennis Buck’s piano virtuosity
was the act that stopped the show
cold and dwarfed every number
that both preceded and followed

And, at last, i turn to the
directors of SlDESHOW, First,
1 will comment on various tech-
nical points of the show: light-
ing and sound effects were ex-
cellent (thanks to Phyllis Lar-
sen), costumes were generally
good, the choreography was cour-

. ageous (under Kathi O’Neil's di-

rection), graphics were beauti-
fully designed by Marc Cunning-
ham, the chorus was very able,
and stage manager Sharon West-
iall ran the show smoothly.

in the “Golden Oldies" sec-
tion both Miss Rosenthal and

former pulsating, rich with life,
and rife with passion in “I Think

latter easy, mellow, and with a
sure understanding of dramatic
stress in " Anyplace i Hang My

in the opening number, “it's

rection proved to be disastrous
Friday night, but was skilled and
professional on Saturday. The
closing number, "if My Friends

Rosenthal Pleasing
Miss Rosenthal was particular-
ly pleasing in her three numbers
from "Mame." “That's How
Young i Feel" was a brassy,
buoyant complement to a song
as seductive and charming as
"If He Walked into My Life."

in the "Bosom Buddies" duo,
Miss Somerville returned to join
Miss Roscnthal in a wonderfully
timed comedy number that kept
the audience giggling hysterica1~
ly at every punchline.

The Beatles' “A Day in the
Life" was Kaufman's choice for
the first act finale. And what
a showstopper it was, complete
with flashing lights, ultra-violet
lights, fluorescent - glowing
costumes, sound effects, psyche-
delic pictures, piped-in music,
and Kaufman’s modest voice
ascending to raspy, bone, blood,
and marrow-chilling hights.

Though one can condemn Kauf-
man's taste (i strongly suspecthe
over-ldollzes the Beatles as, for
example, Beatle music was piped-
ln into Page Hall before each
act began), one would find it
very difficult to condemn both
his imagination and style.

it SIDESHOW was a success,
blame it on audience apprecia-
tion. Directors CarolRosenthal
and Ellis Kaufmanand their crew,
cast and card girl (the very
leggsy Judy Reilly) are to be con-
gratulated for having achieved
their ambition of putting on one
hell of a show.

And though it may earn me the
condemnation of those who actu-
ally believe that a good show
should never be entertaining, i
will definitely state that SIDE-
SHOW Was an absolute success.

First of all a little basic philosophy. With only one
issue a week there is little enough room for what is
right with athletics here at Albany, therefore the emphasis
of this column will be pointed toward what is right, but
if something is obviously wrong i won't beafraid to come
out and say so. - >

Enough said. now for an analysis of this year’s rather
frustrating soccer season. The Joe Garcia coached
hooters finished the season 3-7 which is not good, but
which is about what had to be expected. The squad had
only 5 starters returning, and the freshmen team had
little to offer, as only one soph broke into the starting
lineup. The emphasis was put on defense, and several
players were outstanding in this respect. Co-captains
Tim Jursak and Jerry Leggieri were both top performers,
at fullback and goalie, respectively. Joe LaReau looked
very good, considering he was at a new position, while
John Compeau and Roger Saul also showed considerable
promise in the fullback slots.

With the emphasis on defense the Great Danes hoped
to hold the opposition down and thus win by low, close
scores. The strategy worked to some extent but not
completely. Only one team scored more than three goals,
but the Albany front line came up with only ten goags.

'Gary Swartout came back from a leg injury to supply
much of the Great Danes scoring punch. He came up
with seven goals, with three against Adelphi, and two
against Utica. The rest of the front line, plus the half-
backs often displayed fine ball handling skills, and fre-
quently controlled the ballas effectively as the opposition,
however, they simply lacked the “big foot” thatis needed
to put the ball in the net. ,

Unfortunately the outlook for next year is about the
same. The varsity is losing six starters, and although
the frosh were pretty strong, their strength was mostly
defensive. Once again the Great Danes will probably be
laboring under a disadvantage unique to college soccer.
That is, that when the Great Danes take the field next
year, they will be facing teams like R.P.1. and others
who come in with 5-10 boys who are foreign born, with
a soccer ball at their feet.

Mat Squad Shaping Up

Schedule Toughest Ever

The Albany State wrestling squad is presently prepar-
ing for the coming season with daily workouts in the
confines of Page Hall. The grapplers have only four
lettermen returning, and the schedule is the roughest
ever, but the addition of a couple of transfers coupled
with rapid development in several spots could result in
a fairly decent season.

Returnees include co-

New faces that may help out

Once more the point was miss-

Both team's offenses were then
stalled for the remaining half as

darkness descended, causing in- r

terceptions both ways. Potter
though showed their ability to
hit early and hand on for the
win.

Earlier in the week Potter
looked just as sharp as they
defeated TXO 13-0.

Potter struck early with a.

was capped by Jim Curly hit-
ting Bob Savicki in the end zone.
Then Ray McCloat playing the
role of kicking specialist for the
first time thisseason was 'sent
in. The kick was good and Pot-
ter led 7-0.

TXO received the kickoff, but
could do nothing with the ball and
was forced to punt. Potter then
took over the ball with Ray Mc-
Cloat taking over at quarterback,
while Jim Curly was sent to flank-
er. Both teams could do very lit-
tle though and at the half the
score remained Potter '7, TKO 0.

However, Potter was not to be
held to one touchdown, so late
in the 3rd quarter a second drive
was mounted and McCloat hit
Dan Crippen for the touchdown.
McCloat missed the kick, so
Potter now led 13-0 as they would
at the and of the game.

in League 2 the title is going
right down to the wire. Barring
any future upsets STB will play

determine the winner.

Both teams have looked strong
this season playing hard against
opponents in a very toughleague.

Fresh Boaters Fall 4-]

Albany's freshmen soccer
team ended their season on a
dismal note when Cobieskill
AdrT beat them handily, «M. The
loss gave the puppy Danes a
final record of 2-5-1.

Cobleskiil led the game all
the way as they scored once in
the first quarter and twice in
the second to lead 3-0 at the
half. During the first half, they
completely dominated play and
outhustled Albany. However, in
the second half, the frosh came
back strong and played on even
terms with Cobleskill, a team
that had just received an invita-
tion to the N.C.A. A junior college
tournament. Albany's only score
came in the fourth quarter when
Andy Yturraspe headed in a pass
from Joel Volinski.

The 2-5-1 record certainly
must be looked on as disappoint-
ing. But even though it is not
impressive, it is the best fresh--

men soccer record ever com-
piled for Albany. There were
definite reasons for such a re-
cord: (1) Albany's schedule is
very tough, most games against
two year colleges. (2) The limit-
ed time for practiclrg before the
season. (a) injuries. But more
than any other reason, the fresh-
man never learned an organized
attack.

 

 

captains Roger Gorham and
Craig Springer, 130 pound-
er Bill Clark, and 160

pounder Frank Berry.

Gorham andSpringer were both
mainstays last year as sopho-
mores and they are expected to
be very steady pointer winners
for coach Garcia again this year.
Gorham wrestles at 177, while
Springer is expected to go at 152.

Berry will be expected to im-
prove on his winning record from
last year, and Clark who was
a swing man last year, is pre-
sently battling with GarySmagai-
ski for the 130 spot.

include transfers Erik Watts,
and Francis Weal and sopho-
mores John Jcnks, George
Hawrylchak, Sieve Cherniske and
Marshal Gladstone. -

Watts is a transfer from Syra-
cuse, and he looks like a good
one. He was a State champion
in high school and coach Garcia
is hoping that he will be able to
take a shotvat filling Warren
Crow’s spot with a comparable
record.

Wcal is expected to contribute
some wins in the 137 slot, while
.ienks is developing rapidly at
heavyweight. Cherniske and Glad-
stone are pretty much novices.

F rosh Dump LeMoyne,

Enjoy Successful Season

Albany's freshmen harriers
ended a very successful season
last Tuesday as they rolled to
an easy 20-38 win over the Le-
moyne fresh.

Larry Frederick, Pat Gepfert,
and Don Myers led the way for
the baby Great Danes as they
finished "igether in a triple tie
for first. "heir time was a fine
15:06 for the 3.5 mile course.

Lemoyns runners took fourth
and fifth, while Albany's Jim
Mastromarchi was sixth. Another
LWlol'ne runner was seventh,
but Jay Kaplan and John llerbst
were close behind, assuring the

Great Danes of their third con-
secutive dual match victory, and
giving them a final record of
4-1. A first place in the Lemoyne
invitational, a second place in
the Hudson Valley invitational,
and a third place in the Albany
invitational round out their re-
cord.

This was afine freshmen team,
and the outlook for next year
has to be pretty good, for although
the varsity is losing its two co-
cuptains the fresh wilicontribute
three excellent runners in
Frederick, Geptert and Myers,
plus Kaplan and Masiromarchi.
