.is B. Hershey about the

punish-
ing of those who interfere with
the military process.

The present draft code defers
gradute students to the end of
this year. There is no provision
in existence that will defer any
present graduate student or grad-
Inting senior during the next
school year.

The president pointed out that
if no new law is passed to allow
the students to be deferred, then
next year the graduate schools
will be attended by women, vet-
erans, older men and the
physically disqmlified.

it was President Collins' opin-
ion that Congress would most
likely pass a bill to allow the
present deferment to continue.
The President pointed out tint
the impact on the graduate and
prefessioml schools would be
overwhelming if no new law was
passed.

President Collins raised some
serious doubts about Hershey's
statement that called for the eu-
forcement of the directive that
deferments should be given only
to those individuals who are act-
ing in the national interest.

The president said, despite
Hershey's Opinion that it is an
honor to serve one's country,
that this directive is making
the military service a punish-
ment.

It was also mentioned at the
conference that this punishment
is a form of public jeopardy
since it will be dealt in addi-
tion to any civil punishment,
if a civil trial is held.

3' F or Seminar- Delegates

by Vic Leeper

Central Council overwhelming-
ly defeated a bill which would
have sent two delegates to an
‘Assoclated Student Government
Conference (A86) in San Fran-
cisco at the Thursday, Nov. 16
meeting.

The bill would have appro-
priated $860 to send Dave Cum-
mings and Jim Kahn as dele-
gates to the Caiference. The
money included membership dues
in the A56, registration and
transportation fees.

Council discussion centered
around whether the Conference
would be worth the expenditure.
Jim Kahm said it would because
they would have various seminars
and committee reports dealing
with elections, Judiciary, student
finances etc.

The feeling of Council was
summed up by Miss Judy Mills

For Draft Protesters

by Walter Grant
Collegiate Press Service

WASHINGTON (CPS) Students
who protest the war and the draft
by disrupting army induction cen-
ters or keeping military re-
cruiters from conducting inter-
views should be drafted first,
according to Selective Service
Director Lewis B. Hershey.

Hershey has sent a. notice to
all members of the Selective Ser-
vice system which says defer-
ments should be given only to
individuals who are acting in
the national interest.

Students and others who inter-
fere with the military process
are not acting in the national
interest, and therefore their de-
ferments should be discontinued,
Hershey says.

"There can be no question that
an individual who is engaged in
violating the very law that de-
fered him cannot very well be
acting in the national interest,"
Hershey said in a telephone inter-
view.

The new Selective Seer :e di-
rective could affect thousands of
students at campuses across the
country who have been involved
in recent protests designed to
physically disrupt the military
machine, specifically recruiting
and induction.

Hershey admitted his letter to
local draft boards in a reaction
to the "disruptive and destruc-
tive" trend which protests have

- been taking. “There is a grow-

ing weariness on the part of
the public, and Congressmen and
a lot of others have been saying
why in the devil don't you do
something about these people,"
Hershey said.

However, the Selective Ser-
vice director said his letter of-
fers no new policies. "The law
has been there all the time and
we are just encouraging that it
be enforced.”

Hershey said the directive is
aimed only at those protesters
who on in “1110811 MIM-
ties and lawlessness. We are not
trying to stop anybody from think-
ing or doing anything else as
long as they are within the law."

Hershey's letter does not men-
tion college students inparticular
nor 'specific antirecruiting inci-
dents, but the point is clear since
most of the demonstrations which
fall into the “disruptive” cate-
gory have occurred on or near
college campuses. However, Her-

shey said, "We are not just
picking on college students. This
applies to all persons who have
deferments for any reason."

The authority for Hershey's
directive comes from a section
of the Selective Service law
which provides penalties for in-

dividuals who "knowlingly hinder
or interfere or attempts to do
go in any way by force or vio-
lence or otherwise" with the
Selective Service system.

tion college students in particular
nor specific antirecruiting incl-
dents but the point is clear since

shey said "We are not just pick-
ing on college students. This

authority for Hershey’s direc-
tive comes from a section of
the Selective Service law which
provides penalties for individuals
who "knowlingly hinder or inter-
fere or attempt to do so in any
way by force or violence or
otherwise" with the Selective
Service system.

Hershey's letter said local
boards "may reopen the class-
ifications" of protesters who per-
form illegal acts. “lf evidence
of violation of the (Selective Ser-
Vice) Act and Regulations is es»
tablished," the local board should
"declare the registrant to be a
delinquent and to process him
accordinglv." individuals who
are declared delinquent are
placed first in the order of
call. "if the United States At.-
torney should desire to prose-
cute before the local board has
ordered the registrant for in-
duction, full cooperation will be
given him,” the letter continues.

Hershey said his letter also
refers to persons who either burn
or refuse to carry their draft
cards. However, he said “about
76 per cent of the pieces of
paper which have been thrown
around as draft cards probably
are not.”

The letter, or one similar to
it, reportedly was sent to col-
leges and universities. Asked
about this, Hershey said, “i'm
sure this will receive wide dis-
tribution, but i don't know who
all got it and when.”

Corderences are not worth
going to, and have, therefore,
cut them out of their budgets.

The question of where the
money was coming from then
arose. Kahn stated that the money
would come from the Emergency
Spending Line (ESL).

He stated that the Line is al-
ready in the red but that when
the Line is budgeted everyone
realizes that it is too low, and
hence the usual procedure is to
run the Line in the red. The Line
for this year was set at 33,600.

To this Bill Cleveland answer-
ed that we should not run the Line
in the red any more than neces-
sary due to the low amount of
Student Tax money which is avail-
able. For the most part all future
appropriations will come from
the ESL.

The question was raised as to

Mental-Physical
Happenings Topic
0f Morick Speech

Dr. Harold Morick, assistant
professor of philosophy at State
University of New York at A1-
bany, will present a paper next
month at the annual meeting of
the Pacific Division of the Amer-
ican Philisophical Association in
Berkeley, California.

His paper entitled "Cartesian
Privilege and the Strictly Men-
tal" is concerned with what dis-
tinguishes mental happenings
from physical ones.

Morick is the author of the
book “Wittegenstein and the
Problem of other Minds," a col-
lectionof essays published this
year by McGraw-Hill. The edi-
tion is a study of, in the pro-
fessor’s words, “what justifies
us in attributing a state of con-
sciousness to another person."

Wittegenstein is the noted 20th
Century Austrian philosopher
who proposed the new linguistic
philosophy. Several months ago
Morick read a paper on the phil-
osopher and his work at a meeting
M the Eastern Division of the
American Philosophical Assoc-
iation in Philadelphia. The schol-
ar, who joined the University fac-
ulty last year, holds degrees
from the University of Southern
California and Yale University.

"new the delegates were selected.
Cummings and Kahn were chosen

_by the President, Jeff Mishkin

because neither he nor the Vice-
President Paul Downes would be
able to attend.

Near the end of the meeting
Kahn moved that we withdraw
from the ASG. Debate then en.
sued as to whether we belonged
or not since We have not paid

' dues for this year.

After about 5 minutes of de-
bating, Judy Mills suggested that
we could solve the whole problem

' by writing a letter to the A86.

Kahn then withdrew his motion.

Council also acted onanumber
of other items. A bill was pre.
sented to change the present
policy which states that you can
not use a Campus facility unless
you have a constitution that has
been approved by the appropriate

oup.

This was changed so that a
group can use Campus facilities
for three weeks in order to meet
and draw up a constitution. If
after that time you do not have :1
constitution the use ofthe facility
will be rescinded.

Council made the following
appropriations: $400 to print a
Student Tax brochure which will
explain why it is advantageous to
pay Student Tax, $350 for Russian
Club, and $573 for Ski Club.

Judy Mills andDaveCummings
were delegated to Speak to Dr.

loquium last week on his re-
search of unsaturated fatty acids.

The soft spoken, sandy haired
professor was scheduled to speak
on "Designing an Antibiotic” but
he changed his'toplc to the re
search he is conducting. Block

fatty acids. These acids occur
in both aerobic and anaerobic
organisms.

Block was the co-winner of
the Noble Prize in Medicine in
1964. He was awarded this honor
for his work on cholestrol meta.-
bolism. Block's work with the
synthesis of colestrol began in
1942.

it has been just recently that
the biochemist began his re-
search into the mysteries of fatty
acids. in 1965 Block was the re-
cipient of the Fritzche Award of
the American Chemical Society
for his work with these mater-
ials.

A native of Germany, Block
graduated in 1934 from the Tech-
nische Hochschule in Munich.
He received his Ph.D. in 1310-
chemistry from Columbia Unl-
verslty in 1938.

Block was a Guggenheim Fel-
low ln 1953. He was served on
the editorial board of the Jour-
nal of Biological Chemistry; he
is a member of the National
Academy of Sciences, the Har-
vard Society and the AmericanSo-
ciety of Biological Chemists.

I VCF ’3 Campus Goals
Reflected In History

by Sandy Porter

inter - Varsity Christian
Fellowship movement, which has
been on the University Campus
for nearly twenty years, has its
origins in a movement begun at
Cambridge University in 1877.
Groups of Christian students
banded together for bible study
and prayer. Often these groups
were small and isolated and would
flourish only to die and flourish
again.

Large student conferences
later united the various groups.
After World War 1 it was estab-
lished in every university in
Great Britain and a national
fellowship was begun in Canada
in 1928. Several members of the
Canadian lVCF assisted groups
in the United States and in 1940
the iVCF in the US was formed.
The Albany State chapter is a
branch of this group.

in today's modern world the
inter-Varsity Christian Fellow-
ship is a nationwide interde-
nominational student organiza-
tion of college and university
chapters. lVCF is students unit-
ed by a conviction that college
life can be meaningful through
faith in Christ and that spiritual
life is essential.

lVCF is dedicated to the pur-
poses of showing the relevance of
Christ to college students, growth
in discipleship through Bible
study, prayer, discussions and
conferences and a consideration
of the Christian's responsibility
in world evangelism. in short,
lVCF is a society for Christian
witness inside the university.

The University chapter 1:. ful-
filling its objective by having
sponsored the series "Behold
Your God" which was acomment
on the place of God and the
Christian in modern society. in
the future iVCF‘ will be sponsor-
ing tapes on commitment and
apostleship as well as Christh
witness discussions.

University students are con-
ducting private bible study groups
with at least one group on each
quad. Several students will at-
tend the 8th inter-varsity Urbana
missionary convention.

lVCF functions in the socialas
well as religious realm. Social
events, hootenannies and outings
in the Tri-city area as well as
the lVCF weekend for upstate
New York chapters (this year in
February) are an important part
of the Christian living enjoyed by
members.

Orson Welles’
Neglected Film
Tonight At IFG

Orson Welles' “The Magnip
ficent Ambersons” an underser-
vedly neglected film classic, is_
tonight’s presentation of the in-
ternational Film Group.

With a wit and virtuosity new
to the cinema of 1942, Welles
portrays a fading aristocracy re-
fusing io adjust to the change
that is overtaking their small
town.

The film has been praised
for its exciting use of interiors
and Greek choruspeffect of the
villagers commenting on the fall
of the Ambersons.

Made at the height of the youth-
ful Welles’ power, the moviedis-
plays the cinematic bravura that
made his “Citizen Kane" of the
previous year one of the most
revolutionary films in history.

"The Magnificent Ambersons"
stars Tim Holt, Joesph Cotton,
Agnes Moorhesd, and Anne Ban-
ter. It will be shown this Friday

Central Council
To Scrutinize

I
Parking Rules

The revised regulations for
traffic and parking on campus
were reviewed by Central Coun-
cil at the last meeting held Nov.
16. Questions were raised con-
cerning the Traffic Court, since
the Council has received only
two applications from interested
students to serve on this board.
President Mishkin assured coun-
cil members that he would
assume responsibility for pro-
cessing appeals to this court
until such time that a function-
ing court could be instituted.

Other objections were voiced
concerning the lack of definition
of disciplinary action to be taken
against chronic traffic offenders,
and it was duly noted that a re-
markable amount of parking
spice was set aside solely for
faculty parking.

Two council members, David
Cummings and Judy Mills were
designated to meet with John
Buckhofi, Plant superintendent,
and Chief Centrally of the cam-
pus security force to study and
recommend rule changes in be-
half of Central Council and met-
orists of the student body.
