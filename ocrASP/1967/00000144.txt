Hood 0n M arijuana:

Disclaims Pro-Reports

by Jill Posnilr
Sta/l Reporter-

"Mari is a weak hallucino-
gen; it s a dangerous drug and
should be controlled, howaver
some mitigation of the (exist
laws for the possession and amok.-
ing of the drug should be con-
sidered.”

Although Dr. Janet Hood con-
demns existing laws forsmokers,
she feels they may apply, intheir
present form, to pushers or
sellers.

Dr. Hood has done a good deal
of research on drugs and the drug
problem, and has consulted with
Dr. Cohen, one of the foremost
authorities on the Haight-Ashbury
section of San Francisco.

She believes that most people
are more apt to try marijuana
than anything else because "of
the inane arguments presented
(for it) over and over it: the
press.”

Dr. Hood offered some refuta-
tions to these arguments: v

"There is no evidence to sup-
port statements that marijuana
is effective in stimulating creep
tiveness or in discovering one's
self."

Contributing to the belief that
marijuana is not harnqu is the
fact that it is not addicting,
but "only" habit - form-
ing; the proponents cite this negap
tive factor as a virtue. Dr. Ausu-
bel in the Miller Report states
that "its use does result in
psychological dependence.
Chronic users go togreat lengths
to insure that they will not be
without the drug."

Dr. Hood stated although mari-
juana does not produce addiction
and does not produce a physio-
logical withdrawi syndrome, de-
privation may result in anxiety,
restlessness, irritability or a
state ofdepression (with suicidal
attempts).”

She cited prominent subjective
effects which include: hilarity,
carelessness, distortion of son-
sation, perception and emotional
responsiveness, impairment of
judgment and memory, confusion
illusions and delusions predis-
posing anti-social behavior.

Physiological effects include:

less of coordination in limbs,
lower concentration of glucose
in blood and inflamation of mucu-
ous membranes in the mouth.
Dr. Donald Luria in the Miller
Report states that marijuana may
produce the effects of LSD.
Dr. Hood explained that mari-
juana is illegal because oi its
harmful effects on individuals,
and because it leads to anti-
social behavior. She feels it is
not valid to press for its legal-
ization on the grounds that itis
no worse than slch'ohol because
the existence of one vice is no
basis for allowing that of another
vice.

in addition to there being a lot
more known about alchohol, there
is an element of temperence in-
volved where people know there
are now six million alchoholics.
Why add to this number habitual
marijuana smokers?

Different types, says Dr. Hood
go for each-alchohoi or mari-
juana. The more aggresive, ex-
troverted person chooses the
former while the more with-
drawn, introspective type
chooses the latter.

A further reason for maintain-
ing laws making marijuana il-
legal is that the American pro-
duct is not as potent as hashish,
marijuana in a stronger form

which is associated with crimin-
ality, violence and insanity. (Dr.
Hood cited a report of the sub-
committee on Narcotic Addiction
of the New York Medical Society.)

"if marijuana were legalized
in this country" says Dr. Hood,
“responsible authorities tell us
it would mean the introduction of
llﬂ-Bhiﬂhj” however, because of
the decrease in potency in the
American product it is advocated
that penalties for its use be de-
creased.

To the statement made in an
ASP editorial that the individual
has a right to "life, liberty and
the persuit of happiness" and
therefore marijuana should be
available for those who want it,
Dr. Hood has said that “only
through discipline is there true
freedom; only in accomplishment
happiness."

Presenting another argument
for maintaining the illegal stems
of mariiuana Dr. llood explained
that "all drugs are poison; there
is no such thing as an hiccuous
drug.”

Mutual Development

lIX~COfl Lindemen

in the future development of
the State University System one
necessary prerequisite for a plan
of growth is a. concern for the
community in which the Univer-
sity is located. Public service
and community relations encom-
pass this concern.

in emphasizing‘ these goals,
the memorandum sent out in the
'summer oi 1967 by Samuel B.
Gould, Chancellor of the State
University of New York concern-
ing the preparation of a Campus
Academic Plan and a Campus
Development 'Plan for 1968, em;
phasizes obligations of the Uni-
versity. '

me of these obligations of the
University is to function as a
"constructive critic of society
with implications for academic
and operatitllal freedoms within
responsibility.”

Many areas of public services
are wan to the ‘University sys-
tem. in the field of adult educa-
tion there exists the possibility
of offering formal education to
adults who never had the oppor-
tunity or ability to enter college.

The University will not change
the future by itself. other forces
operate which will also change
the composition of the inputs of

the University. — the faculty em-

" played and the student enter-

ing — and, thereby, change its ,

Outputs.

What will be the new boundaries
of the University? Will the future
University system assume these
roles that were the respon-
sibilities of government and in-
dustry previously? Or will the

its occur with outside in-
stitutions assuming former Uni-
versity obligations?

it is evident to see the impor-
tance of understanding the nature
of the immediate community and
its changing role. For the Uni-
versity to be a forerunner in
research and an innovator and
initiator of new ideas it must
maintain leadership in these
areas.

if the University is to function
in an specifically located area it
must have a surroundhig popula-
tion that will meet its basic
cadre of non-professional em-
ployes.

An entire program can be de-
veloped within the state Univer-
sity system instructing those ad-.
ults who previously did not com-
plete a high school education.

There also exists the possibili-
ty of offering less formal teaching
or consultative contributions to
the community, state, nation and

the world. The program could
schedule discussions such as
water and air pollution and basic
world problems — social, politi-
cal or economic.

A more complex world is de-
veloping the need to be informed
on domestic and foreign affairs,
The expansion of television
broadcasts on important issues
is one possible method ofexpand~
ing the University to fill the need
of informing the 10cal populace.

Surrounded by a growing
metropolis the University can
serve as a “critic of society."
Through its research, its honor-
able past and those who teach,
this may be accomplished.

A University must have adequ.
ate public utilities near it: air-
ports, libraries, adequate high-
ways, housing for faculty needs,
hospitals and industries for re
search. If a deficiency is found
in any area the University must
develop some program with local
or State government to remedy
the problem.

The University has always been
known as a "Community within
itself." But a Univorsity needs
a community which can provide
it with services. The University,
in turn, must see the changing
Community and the implications
of this Change on its institution.

F aculty-Student Relationships
Are Encouraged To Be Closer

by Fredric Jeiiee

it is entirely possible for a
student in the large university to
teter on the brink of four yearsof
undergraduate education without
ever risking acommitment; some
find it possible in the present
system, to evade the most for-
midable dimensions, and manage
to devote themselves to startling
, inanities, which often materialize
into lifelong absurdities.

This is not to imply that every
student must equip himself with
a copy of Ulysses under one
arm, the Bagavad Gita in the
other, a ﬂashlight prOpped be-
tween his knees, suspended from
the nearest saucer, intent in his
desire to transcend mundane

matters. But it, indeed, a u‘nl-
versity consists of something
more than lectures, examina;
tions, reading assignments, anda
few directed extra-curricular
activities, it should dwell upon
the already existing Faculty-Stu-

dent relationship, ultimately
relying upon it as a source of
strength.

During the high school years, a
barrier is formed which pre-
vents interaction between stu-
dents and their teachers. It may
be penetrated occasionally in the
form of class trips or marking
papers (better known in the verna-
cular as brown-nosing) but there
is never a chance to sit down and
talk over a cup of coffee. Rela-

Harshness of Campus

Softened At Dippikill

by Gory Gelt

When one finds himself sur-
rounded by the harsh reality and
the graceful lines of the Acade-
mic Podium, he mustoccasional-
iy seek the recourse ofthe rurals.
This recourse can be found inthe
Adirondack Mountains at the
Dippikill Campus.

Dippikill is not without some
historic background. The farm-
house, one of the two buildings
located there, was built about
1890. it was purchased in 1954,
after 50 years of vacancy and
neglect. A fireplace, chimney,
plumbing, and electrical wiring
were installed. Today there is
no electricity but the farmhouse
is still wired for it.

The Goodman Piaceisthe other
house located at Dippikill. it is
down the road from the farmhouse
and has electricity, a modern
kitchen and fifteen bedrooms.

Despite the fact that presently
only twenty people may use Dippi-
kiil on any one weekend, the
Adirondack Campus is a topic of
much controversy. Quite a few
years ago, the student Associa-
tion designated $60,000 for the
building of a lodge or motel at
Dippikill. An architect was em-
ployed and a contract signed.
Since then, nothing much hasbeen

“lav

The building of a slick and
splashy motel is being consider.
ed to increase the interest in
Dippilriil for weekend outings.
During, the last two years, only

the Newman and Outing Clubs
have been known to use the
Adirondack site often. With a
motel, students could enjoy as
much "country living” as they
desire, and then return to the
conveniences of modern life.

A Dippikill motel presents
many considerations though, Tile
road leading to the motel is not
accessible in the winter and must
he repaved or completely renov-
ated. A parking lot would also
have to be built. Will the motel
be open to the public or just to
Albany students? Will the mo-
tel be filled each weekend? Will
it be closed during the week?
Will a regular staff be employed?
Will the income be more thanthe
expenses?

However, many feel the motel
will probably destroy some of
Dippikill's country appeal and
rusticlty.

Dr. Thompson Littlefield of
the English department has in-
troduced over 100 students to
Dippikiil and feels it has been a
meaningful experience for at
least half of them. Littlefield
describes the Adirondak Campus
as the “Dippikill way of life"
which is a “real element" in the
modern civilization.

Since the Dippikillsite is mere-
ly an hour's drive from Albany,
Littlefield feels it is a shame
that more students do not make
use of the facilities there. He
feels that perhaps a motel or
lodge would solve this problem
but at the same time may result
in a loss of uippi's atmosphere.

k.

tionships superceding the aca-
demic realm are discouraged to
the degree that teachers engaging
in questionable relationships are
expulsed.

As entering freshmen we con-
structed delicate misconceptions
which were slowly broken down
and re-fashioned into a more
realistic view of things. One of
them, undoubtedly, included a
hazy picture of anintesnse, dyna-
mic discussion with a professor,
carried on into the early hours of
the morning, stimulating drowsy
brain cells, being shaken out of
lethargy, ultimately enjoying a
refreshing exchange of ideas.

Mario Savio perceived the
situation well at Berkeley: "The
teacher whom yon will strain to
see while he lectures will he
very seldom available for discus-
sion with his students. The sys-
tem is rarely reSponslve to
human needs. There are too few
teachers, and too little time. In-
deed, if the professor is one of
those really famous scholars of
whom the university is under-
standably proud, then the primary
reason is that there is not enough
time for the problems of in-
dividual undergraduates. The
bulk of the professor’s time is
devoted to 'rcsearch' or spun!
with graduate students. The
moral of the piece: if you wantiu
get an education, you will havuto
get it yourself. This is true in
any case, but it is not usually
intended to be true in the sensu
that getting it yourself means in
spite of the work at School."

There is anenormous, yawning
gap between students and pro-
fessors, and while there are a
good number of peeple who are
trying in some way to relate tin-
two, a majority of the inhabitants
herein are so involved in thvir
own limited spheres that tlneyw
fuse to accept necessary Innova-
tions.

Our Patroon Room Lounge ls
barred to students during the
day. Office space is alloicd to
every member of the universitl’
staff, hours are plannedtoinsurc
convenience, and yet the door-
ways are rarely crossed by uny-
one, unless there is a possibility
of a falling or unsatisfactory
grade.

Discontent such as this will
lie in abeyance until there is a
desire, an impetus which may
invite a challenge.
