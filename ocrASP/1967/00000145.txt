Student Association or Student Body

We have been frequently criticized for
maintaining a nihilistic editorial policy
towards student government. Although we
have been highly critical both of the ac-
tions of our government this year and of
the whole governmental organization of
our undergraduate body, we do not feel
our attitudes toward student government
are in any way nihilistic.

We uphold the idea of maintaining an
effective and efficient student govern-
ment. We feel all governments should
possess both the means of collecting and
disseminating their funds with as little
red tape as possible, and the legal means
to incite social change.

in executing the first, a government
must fairly represent all students who
supply funds for the organizations com-
ing under the jurisdiction of the govern-
ment; and, in executing the second, all
students should be represented.

Concerning the inciting of social change.
we would like to see government work to
free students from any archaic regula-
tions affecting students in order to ulti-
mately obtain as freely structured a Uni-
versity as possible.

The first hang-up here is that not all
the students who are affected by social
change are the students who are funding
the organizations coming under the gov-
erning body. The Student Association gov-
ernment is not really a student govern-
ment; it exists only for student tax paying
members of the student body.

The government is not structured on a
universal basis, but rather on a basis
which provides for the perpetuation of the
Student Association. Subsequently, repre-
sentation to Central Council. in effect the
main governing body of the students, is or-
ganized on a commission. as well as pop-
ularly elected. level.

These commissions represent an in-
terest in a given area and dispense with
much of the red tape existing in the sub-
organization of that particular area. in
this way, a great deal of haggling is taken
off the shoulders of the main body. Con-
currently. there is no actual president
of the student body; rather the Council
elects a chairman who is then the Presi.
dent of the Student Association.

Central Council exists largely as a
rubber stamp for action taken by its sub-
sidiary commissions and committees; the
Chairman exists to head thh main body.
luzither are by nature political.

v i this way also it is not Central CWH-

cil who initiates social legislation; direct
action for change is deferred to the com-
missions and subcommittees.

As far as expediting financial matters,
the Central Council is a direct and effi-
cient body. The only problem is that it is
not a student government. All action taken
by the Student Association, or by Central
Council, is initiated by tax paying stu-
dents. Non tax-paying students never have
a voice in any matter. it is due to this
condition that our government should be
changed.

We do not want to see a large popu-
larly elected body to handle the finances
of the Student Association; nor do we
want a large cumbersome government
which is by nature quasi-political. How-
ever, we do support representation of all
students who will be affected by a social
policy change.

We do favor the forming of a second
body of students which will be entirely
popularly elected. This body would oper-
ate independently of the Student Associa-
tion financing, etc., although tax paying
members may also be elected to it.
In this way the body would be represen-
tative of all students. This body would
concern itself with studying changes and
laying the groundwork for these changes.

The legal structure would not have to
be changed except that the commissions
would add at-large, popularly elected dele-
gates to their membership. These dele-
gates would be largely concerned with
the discussion and implementation of so-
cial legislation and would not vote on
financial matters. The larger social body
would work with the existing government
on the commission level in inciting social
changes which would affect all students.
it need not change the make-up of Central
Council. and would not impinge on the af-
fairs of the Student Association.

We realize that this system would set
up a bicamerai legislature; however, asit
stands now we have a student body com-
posed of two separate groups, the tax-
payers and the non-tax payers. if you have
two different bodies which need represen-
tation, this seems the only way to make
such representation feasible.

in this way, a central body would exist
to which all students could direct ques-
tions and receive direct answers. Stu-
dents would know a main body to consult

of napalm to the war in Vieum
which has greater adhesive qui-
itios. When upslm comes in
coth with the body, it not only
causes burns, but continues to
sat at the flash for hours.

The scientific research in
chemical - biological nrtsre
(CBW) which is actively being
pursued by the Defense Depart-
ment, is housed in universi-
ties across the country. Up to
'15 per cent of research con-
tract money at many universi-
ties comes directly from federal
sources.

It is conceivable tint there are
phony research foundations, set
up by the Defense Department
to channel tax dollars into re-
search, lilts the cm which set
tip phony foundations to support
me National Student Association.

The number of Defense De-
partment contracts in American
universities has increased in re-
cent years. Thc total amount re-
quested for fiscal year 1968 for
Defense research was $1.75 bil-
lion.

Project Themls, a recent pro-
ject which inwalves around 50 pro-
jects in over 40 universities, is
designed to “develop more cen-
ters of exceuence in engineering
and other hard sciences." (Busi-
ness Week. Sept. 9, 1967).

While some Defense Depart-
ment projects are not directly
related to warmre or thewespon-
ry of warfare, they areallauthor-
iced for and can be applied to
specific use by the military as-
tablishmsnt.

it is a common belief in this
country that what is good for the
Army is good for the country
(to rewrite a phrase). However,
in light of three aspects of the
military in 1967, it is time to
re-evalmtc that assumption.

One — the use of chemical and
perhaps biological warfare in
Vietnam is a clear disregard for
international agreements suchas

 

. the canon protocols ofl929,the
United Nations Clurtsr.’ and the
findings, of the Nuremberg 'i'ri.

Two — the admitted secrecy
of these projects, including the

~ misrepresentation of use of
those research projects, puts
in jeopardy civilian control of
military decisions.

The control of contagious dis-
eases, theoretically a most
worthwhile project, is under the
direction of the Defense Depart-
ment as a necessary part of the
"war plans" for using chemi-
cal-ﬂolcgioal weapons (CBW).

Based on an underlying as.
sumptlcn that the Soviet Union is
willing to use any means to con-
quer the world, the Defense De-
partment authorises CBW re-
search and calculates how many
people we can afford to lose in
such a war and still "win."

The fear of communism which
called for a bigger and better
bomb, new demands a mater and
deadlisr biological warfare wea-
pan.

Three — an unwritten, unde-
bated, unpubllcized change in the
foreign policy of our government
is responsible for paramilitary
and counter-insurgency research
and trial projects. The policy of
nuclear deterrence has given way
to preventive wars in underde-
veloped countries judged ripe for
Communist influence.

This new foreign policy re-
quires the involvement of univer-
sity facilities. The Defense De-
partment can guarantee the use
of these facilities only because
the same pressures which arr-
applied to our political leader:
for the development of CBW wea-
pons can be applied to universi-
ties to do the dirty work. \

This is based on a dependence
of univsrsities for government
money plus a close tic of the
universities with the businesses
which make money manufacturing
the weapons once they are de-
vsloped.

How can a university maintain
academic freedom when it is hand
cuffed by a military-industrial
compleif Next week, I’ll dis-
cuss that question and the involve-
ment of our campus in the De-
fense program.

This is the last in a series of
four articles examining and crit-
icizing the operation of Student
Association and Central Council.
Two weeks ago, [explained why
the present methods of election
for Central Council members
promotes juvenile politics and
conflicts of interest. in this
last article i hope to show how
constitutional changes could pro-
vide more fertile soil for the
growth of an adult political style
and at least a tinge of democ-
racy.

First, the growth of political
parties should be encouraged.
This is not to say that such par-
ties should be "set up” by fiat:
obviously meaningful parties
must grow up out of genuine
differences of opinion. But for
any parties to develop that could
be suitable vehicles for opin-
ion, the fraternity and sorority
voting blocs must be broken up,
together with any other blocs
that are based merely on mem-
bershlp in the same dorm. i
say this not because i amagainst
Greeks as such, but because
the Greeks have traditionally vot-
ed in blocs which have absolute-
ly nothing to do with a political
issue, unless one considers per-
sonality an issue. Nevertheless,
the sheer size of the "Greek"
vote makes it difficult for a par-
ty with any general appeal to
heat the fraternity - and v soror-
ity - sponsored candidates.

Second, in the interests of

democracy, there should band I ‘

representatives of special in-
terest groups on Central Coun-
cil. This means abandoning the
whole creaking helrarchy or
Commissions and Boards, ex-
cept for administrative purpos-
es, if any. Many people, i think,
would cheerfully say good rid-
dancc to this system, which
has not worked well since its
inception. For instance, instead
of choosing representatives from
living areas or student organiza-
tions, perhaps the whole Cen-
tral Council membership cmihl
be put on an at-iarge basis us-
ing preferential ballots.

Third, the President of Con-

traiCouncil should be Bliii'ivll
us such from the student body,
and not chosen by Central Coun-
cil from among its own mem-
bers. The post is too lmporinnl
to allow a small number of poo
pie to control elections for ii.
The present system is like in-
diract election of U.S. Senators
by the House of Repressninlivzas.

Fourth, voting membership on
Council should be restricted to
students, and faculty or ntlnlin»
lstration advisors should he
strictly optional.

Finally, Central Council as
now organized is too large to
operate efficiently as one group
and too small to be representin-
tive of 6,000 students. Either
it should he reduced to an Exec-
utive Committee of fewer Hum
10 persons, or it should be ex-
panded to u "Congress" with
subcommittees.

Presidini of the Student Association

 

 

 

in the spring of 1965 Provi-

ysiomi Council presented a new

constitution to the student body.
This document outlined a student
organisation that was a radical
e from the completely
electoral based Solute system.
'ms Solute, plagued by inef-
ficiency sndfrsqusntlsckofqmr-
ms, was written outcfsxistence
in favor of s coordinating body,
vested with supreme logislativc
and executive power, and various
subsidiary bodies, each with a
speciﬁc area of concern.

. With the acceptance of the
new constitution, Central Coun-
cil, the five Commissions, and
the several Boards began to op-
orstc. in its first year, Cen-
trsl Council occupied itself by
adding muscles and flesh to the
skeletal constitution. The Coun-
cil simply established the
mechanics necessary to set the
Student Association in motion.
Last year CentralCouncil tinker-
sd with its creation and found it
basically sound. But, now that
our third year is well underway,

. it is becoming increasingly evi-

dent that certain areas are weak,
certain areas are having trouble
functioning, and indeed, certain
areas can simply no longer func-
tion. This is due in part to an over-
specific constitution, some lack
of foresight, downright indiffer-
ence, and most unfortunately,
personal animosities which have
clouded our deliberations, and de-
maaned us as an organization.
Some of the difficultiescan be re-
solved by merely rewriting sec-
tions of problematic statutes, or
writing completely new statues.
The solution to other difficulties
can be found only in much less
mechanical means.

Recently, one rather all-encomm

passing solution has been pro-
poundad — that is, to scrap the
whole sordid mess and strikeout

in a bold, new direction. This
bold, new direction is, oddly
enough, a return to the old cloc-
toral based Sonata system. The
attempt here would be to inject
politics hack into a system that
was not designed to be primarily
panties]. 'l‘hosa who espouse this
cause, I believe, have made an
0 analysis of the rea-
sons underlying the utter fhilure
of tho Solute.
The Senate failed principally

because my interested in the

University were left totally un-
prcssntsd. This neglect of im-
portant areas is a danger tint
would be inherent in any student
organization drawing its repre-
sentation solely from popular
elections. in the referendum of
1965, the students clearly indicat-
ed their decision: to sacrifice
some direct representation
so that all interests and concerns
might have a channel to the pri-
mary legislative body. fthink this
was a wise decision and I see
nothing, at this time, that war-
rants a denial of that decision.

Is the system perfect? Asl
mentioned above, of course not.
No system, as long as it is ad-
ministered by humans, is per-
fect. But although we find prob-
lems and weaknesses pressing in
on all sides, i honestly believe
answers can be found.

This third year of our new
Student Association is a criti-
cal year. It is critical because
by the time our last meeting is
gaveled to adjournment, it will
be obvious that Central Council
is either viable enough to with-
stand and cope with changing
needs, or too infleidble to band
when it is essential that it does
bend. if we can resolutely ad-
dress ourselves to common of-
fort now, the system cannot help
but succeed. We cannot wait any
longer. We have waited too long
already.

Friday night's folk concert at
The Washington Avenue Armory
was the epitome of student con-
cern and cooperation. Due to
inclement weather, the appear-
ance of Buffy Saints-Marie was
delayed by two and one half hours.
Even so, an understanding audi-

ed during the interlude by some
of SUNYA's finest folk talent.
i would like to take this oppor-
tunity to give special thanks to
Andy Nagel and John Blrchler,
Ed Silver, and John Harrison,
all of whom on short notice can-

perform until Buffy arrived. 1
have received several comments
to the effect that Friday night
was the best folk concert we've
ever had at state. l'm sure that
the capacity crowd was in full
agreement, judging from their
reaction to our own four folk

Community Action Agencies,
the most meaningful program in
the Office of Economic Oppor-
tunity is a strange animal. They,

'like 'VlSTA projects, have psr-

sonslitias completely onto them-
sslvss. The one i worked for,
the Colin County Community
Action Program, became an sf-
fcctive and powerful force in' the
town of Baton, New Mexico by
collecting junk. Let me explain.

As you know, the Office of
Economic Opportunity is a Fod-
cral Agency, atrlsubsequentially,
so are the many CAP projects
under its auspices. What you
might not know is that as a
Federal Agency CAP programs
are subject to the same regula-
tions and priviliges as any other
Federal Agency (like the U.S.
Air Force). One of these pri-
viliges is the right to acquire
surplus property from the Gen-
eral Services Administration.
From a government studies text-
book point-of-vlew, this may not
sound like much, but when you
consider what a bureaucracy like
the United States Government
leaves in its wastebaskets, the
pickings seem quite lucrative.

You see, Government agencies
are not allowed to merely throw
things away. Government pro-
perty is public property and g0:
vernment garbage is public gar-
bage. When an agency discards
a typewriter, for example, the
typewriter is put on a GSA
"excess property" list and,
should another agency need a
typewriter all they have to do
is put in a request for it. This,
you may be happy to know, saves
tax dollars.

My boss, the local CAP direc-
tor, realized this and, having
mucho time on his hands plus
a very undefined program) be-
gan to acquire some of this
excess from the GSA. His ini-
tial efforts brought back modest
results. From Canon Air Force
Base in the deserts of New Mex-
ico he acquired a ton and ahalf

truck, an item the Air Force

was fully justified in wishing
to be rid of. But after a few
hundred dollars fo repair Col-
fax County CAP had the means
of bringing back bigger and bet-
ter things. Kirtland AFB had no
use for some desks, some heat-
ers, come tables, chairs and
beds. Los Alamos, the atomic
testing laboratories, was dis-
carding several hundred gallons
of paint. Then Sandla Base in
Albuquerque offered a line strip-

The right to dissent is an un-
questionable prerogative of the
American citizen. Likewise it is
the dissenter's responsibility to
carefully consider the ration-
ality, motives and consequences
of his actions.

Many of the recent anti-war
demonstrations provide classic
examples of misused dissent.
To be specific, consider the mo-
tives and consequences of the
infamous "march on the Pants-
gon." The purpose of the mobil-
ization was to confront the war-
makers and halt the operation of
the Pentagon. The demonstrat-
ors, enraged at what they behaved
to be the U.s.’s disregard for in-
ternational law and comparing the
U.S. to Nazi Germany,procceded
to do some very ironic things.
First they broke the law by,cx-
ceeding the legal limits of the
demonstration. Then they used
the Nazi tactics they profess to
abhor when they stormed the
Pentagon and clashed with the
troops.

Unfortunately the real losers
in such an incident are not the
protesters who might get a few
nights in jail or a banged head,
but the troops in Vietnam. Many
of the Peaconiks are skeptical
as to the propaganda value de-
rived from the war protests by
the Communists. l would suggest
these doubters listen to Radio
Moscow or Radio Havana some
availing. During thusenrnadcasts
the Reds actually thank the

demonstrators for their encour-
agement, and have specifically
bestowed their heartfelt gratitude
to SDS (Students for a Democrat-
ic Society) on several occasions.

The protesters claim to he
guided by conscience. if their
demonstrations encourage the
enemy and prolong thewar can
their consciences accept the
deaths of the American G.l.'s

been killed? if only ONE G.l.

Review Of llic New Right Wing

 

 

by Roy Bertrand

ft is a general misconception
among the Americans of today
that right-wingers are neces-
sarily fascist, or reactionary,
or both. This is not so. Conserv-
atives today are strongly oppos-
ed io both fascism and reaction.

Conservatives consider fas-
cism a parallel to slavery. In
their eyes, a dictator, whether
he be Franco in Spain or Mac
in China, must never command
their support. Conservatives are
in favor of a firm stand in Viet-
nam because they realize from
their study of World War if
that imperialist aggrassors like
Germany, or in this case Com-
munist China, cannot be appeas-
ed. Today's right-wing is oppos-
ed to giving aid to Communist
nations, because these same na-
tions may use this aid to erect
weapons systems that may some-
thy be used against the United
states. Conservatives are against
the recognition of Red China for
two reasons. The first is that we
recognize the Nationalists on
Formosa as the legal Chinese
government, and it would be
idiouc to recognize two govern-
ments as the just leaders of the
same country. The second reason
is the fact that Mac is not the
representative of the Chinese
people.

Now we should examine the so-
cial security myth. Most people
feel that conservaqu are in
favor of the complete dosime-
tion of social security. This idea
is almost entirely fhlse. Right-
wingers consider social security
a great institution . . . if you
want it. Conservatives feel that
American citizens should have
the right to choose between put-
ting your monoy in the central
government every week and, upon
retirement, taking the chalice of
getting back a fraction of what

your deposit was, and puftiru
your money in a bank where you
could acquire an interest on your
deposit, andknow tint your money
is there, multiplying itself, and
ready for you when you retire or
your children when you die. After
all, the money is yours, since
you've earned it and you should
have the right to do with it as
you please.

Despite popular opinion, true
conservatives are not bigots.
They prefer to judge men indi-
vidually by their accomplish-
ments, rather than collectively
by their ethnic hackgrounds.Con-
servatives are in favor ofequal
rights and equal opportunity for
all people. However these rights
do not include the right to riot
and destroy property, ncrdothey
include the right to hold ill the
functioning of government, by
such means as President John-
son calis “storm-trooper tac-
tics.” Rioting and destruction of
property are against the law, and
laws are made to protacttheciti-
sens. i know that lwouldn't want
my home burned down because
someone has an inferiority com-
plex. Whether they realise it or
not, all Negroes are now legally
equal to whites, and the only
thing that can erase prejudice is
an industrious and peace-loving
Negro people, not a destructh
one. Conservatives are vehe-
mently cpposedtc rewardim riot-
ers by giving in to their dellliil'ldd.
Conservatives feel that rictcrs
should be punished, rather tlnn
rewarded. Conservatives are
also against any tactics by hip-

pies or anyone else that attempt
to force the national government
to go against the will of the ma-
jority merely because those
youths feel it should. lhope that
this essay has enlightened the
minds of some people to what
the true conservative stands for.

 

 

 

ment can they still live with them-
selves?

The demonstration on cam-
pus Monday, November 20, was
at times unfortunate. lfprayers
and peace songs were the extent
of the “vigil,” the demonstra-
tion would have been a very
appropriate means of expressing
an opinion. However, at times
the participants engaged in bois-
terous songs and folk dances

concluded by laughter, applause
and joking. The noble goal of a
quiet peace vigil seemed to de-
teriorate into a carnival atmos-
phere. During their gaiety did
the protesters remember the
American boys fightingthe blood-
iest battle of the war at Oak To?
in their haste to play ring-around.
tho-campus center did they not
lose sight of their goals?

i hope that in the Mill‘s, DO.

tential protesters will carefully
analyze their goals and cumin
their dissent with responsibility
and restraint.
