It wasn't exactly what you'd
call “another sleepy, dusty,delta
day," eventhough some days here
at State are somewhat sleepy
and dull and dusty. No, it was
just cold; the kind of cold that
when you first look out the win-
dow in the morning you wantto
cut your classes and fallback
in bed wrapt in the sweet arms
of Morpheus for the rest of the
day. And yet, despite the cold,
our solemn band of Ed. 2i fans
stood in front of the Infirmary
waiting for the bus to convey
us to our first "Wservation"
at a nearby local high school.
A nervous enthusiasm gripped
our collective souland our hearts
beat as one as we boarded the
bus. Excitement ran high and we
jabbered like school kids who've
just gotten their high school class
rings. And then we were there. . .

The 'enemy eyed us suspic-
iously as We got off the bus.
We filed into the school ner-
vously fingering our pencils,
pens, clipboards or whoever was
nearest. I thought I had walked
onto the set for "To Sir, With
Love” during a break to shoot.
ing: there are all these dumb
looking, greasy haired kids with
high pants and white socks, and
teen- age skin problems; kids
who were walking around with a
posture reminiscientofCro-mag-
non Man and have that sneer
particular to their breed, and a
dull look about the eyes. These
were the kids you hoped you’d

get away from if you went to
college. And then we went down
to the Faculty Lounge which was
next to the boiler room (i almost
left my Snack Bar lunch there).
That Lounge was every bit as

.depressing as getting eight

o'clocks every day, flunking two

'midterms and losing your ID

(literally and figuratively). Then

the principal, who was there on

an athletic scholarship, assigned
as to the classes where we were
to do our observing. l was as-
signed to a mechanical drawing
class. The halls were dim and
the lockerdoors banged men-
acineg as the kids prepared for
their next class.

on, how I longed to be bad:
in SUNY Country of bright wnite
buildings and clean, intelligent
looking kids and an equally clean
and intelligent looking facility.
I walked into my assigned class
and all of a sudden I knew that
I was back in high schoolagain
because the teacher yelled at me
togogetalatepassandao-
companied this verbal assault
with a piece of chalk, the black-
board eraser, a30-60-90 triangle,

twanged and vibrated when it
stuck in the wall behind me.
“WELL, WHO ARE YOU?” he
wanted to know when I refused
to go get a late pass. Iexplained.
“SIT DOWN," he commanded
and hurled an ink well for em-

about the Good, does not fight
for it as well. '
—David Robbins, THE
UOWDITCH REVIEW, Fall
1967

That this quote heads an anti-
Vletnam war paper is ludicrous!
The anti-war people are doing
anything but FIGHTING for the
lGood." The people who are
fighting for the Good are in
Vietnam. The GOOD IS OUR
COUNTRY and all that it stands
for. Our country, though not
perfect, is the best the world
has to offer and anyone who
disagrees should move out!

Everyone values peace, but
those who fight for our country
value freedom more. if all you
want is peace, live in East Ber-
lin. Peace is ENFORCED there.
However, if it is the freedom
to express your ideas concern-
ing man’s condition and gov-
ernment policies without fear
oi censorship or imprisonment,
then America is what you must
support.

The anti-war boys are refus-
'ng to fight for the very free-

doms they are exercisingso free-
ly -— The freedom to criticize
your government’s policies. If
you don't like the war in Viet-
nam, then vote accordingly in
the next election. If the major-
ity of the population agrees with
you, the war will end. BUT,
until that election you must
fight for your country or one
day there may not be an elec-
tionl
Let him be damned who, while
he learns and talks about Amer-
ica, does not fight for it as well.

eral kids slept through. I as-
sumed that they had caught the
matinee. Then they began the
lesson for the day: to sketch
a square block of wood. Fan-
tastically dull. And how many
times had I cursed State for be-
ing dull. "For shame," Iseemed
to hear a heavenly voice say to
me. i couldn't wait to get back;
I swore I’d kiss the Podium.
The bell rang signaling the end
of the period and l bolted for
the door and jumped onto the
bus panting, nervous, exhausted;
but happier to be bound for home
than I omr had been before.

When we returned, true to
my word, I bounded off the bus
and showered the Podium with
kisses suitable for a parents-um
I then marched off to my science
lab. I was late and the instruc-
tor stared icily at me as I
walked to my seat. Then we had
a film "Everyman A Biologist"
which a few of the class dosed
through migh school transfers

I looked at the faces of the kids

The Cale' Au Go Go

Tianksglving night found me
at the Cafe' Au Go Go for their
annual "Blues Bag." To say the
very least, it was an evenlngthat
gave me much pleasure. Theper-
formers included the James Cot-
ton Blues Band, Richie Havens,
Dave Van Bonk and the Hudson
Dusters and the Paul Butterfield
Blues Band.

The Go Go changed its sound
system a bit from the last time
I was there. Now, they have very
large speakers placed every
seven feet along the well. Thus,
no matter where you sit, you are
surrounded by sound, sound
transfixes you and at the same
time, transcends you.

James Cotton and Richie Havens

The James Cotton Blues Band
is one of the traditional bands
from Chicago. The sound that
they have reminded me so much
of is the havoc Muddy Waters
played in Albany last Spring.
Truly, they are one of the finest
bends in existence tothy.

Many people lave been talking
about Richie Havens and all the
talk has been good. Last week,
I finally heard what the talk
was about and believe me, the
talk doesn't begin to do him jus-
tice. His voice, his style of gui-
tar playing, his stage manner, his
arrangements, all have done
much to give the old style of
blues portrayal a boost that many
people feel it needed. Havens is
well on his way and he won't be
just a passing fancy. He is here
to stay.

Van Rank and Butterlicld

Dave Van Honk is a very wierd
character. There are times that
I have heard him and he has
been absolutely beautiful. And
then there are the other times,
times like Thursday night, when
he was so poor that the emcee
tried to shut him off after two
songs. The fact that he was play-
ing with an electric group (the
Hudson Dusters) tlat was by it-
self not even mediocre, didn't
help matters any. His was the only
bad segment of a fantastic even-
ing.

Then along came Butterffeld.
People had been telling me that
he had lost much since his per-
sonnel change (he is now work-
ing with a tenor sax, soprano
sax, trumpet, guitar, organ, pia-
no, bass and drums). When they
first started playing, I was in-
clined to agree with what I had
heard. But this was becausel
was expecting the old sound of
the Chicago Blues Butterfield.
This is far from what he gave
me. The group is a perfect mix-
ture of blues, psychedelic Rock
and Coltrane's jazz (that's right.

Coltrane's jazz). It's the kind
of sound that at first hits you
the wrong way. You really don't
know wlnt to make of it and in
a sense, it almost turns you off.
But then, as it progresses, you
start totuneintoitandall
of a sudden, it hits hard. You
are in a completely new world
and the sounds tint are trans-
porting you on a cloud filling
your brain until there is no room
for anything else. There is really
only one way to describe him:
mindblowlng.

All inall,thlswasavery
fantastic evening that did much
to settle my turkey-filled stom-
ach.

Again: The Festival

Slowly but surely, the prob-
lems hitting the Jazz festival
are being solved. I have found
out tint the main difficulty
between me and Special Events
Board is a difference in philoso-

phy. I will grant this. But, re- ’

gardless of what our philoso-
phies are, I do feel tint the en-
tire issue could be solved by
looking at two very important
points. First, lets face one fact:
when it comes to jazz, there
is no one else on this campus
that has a better knowledge of
it than I do. Thus, when it comes
to a problem of deciding what's
good in jars, one would expect
the Board to consider this fact
and pay heed. This isn’t conceit
in any sense of the word. I'm
simply stating a fact. Special
Events Board doesn’t have the
knowledge of jazz that I do. And
yet, instead of capitalizing on
this knowledge, they are disre-
garding it. Poor choice, friends.

Secondly, the purpose of a fes-
tival is to provide an overview
of a field for the benefit of an
audience. How can this purpose,
which is the all-encompass-
ing purpose for every festival
in every medium, beaccomplish-
ed with one performer? Wha‘
makes it worse, the performer
is about as antiquated as bath-
tub gin.

Another point: why bother se-
lecting chairmen if the job is
already done? The performers
(sic) have been hired, the rest
of the money will be needed
for publicity, and there is noth-
ing left to do except introduce
the performers. That won’t carry
it, people. There has got to be
something in the job to make it
worthwhile to the prospective
chairmen.

I just hope that it is not too
late to change the situation and
give the student body the type of
show they have earned with their
tax money.

Fourth TimeA round

Trying to write objectively
about the Buffy Salute-Marie con-
cert may prove to be the most
difficult assignment of my short
journalich career. I have one
basic hang-up about Buffy—I don't
like her. Not that ldon't con-
sider her both an excellent on-
tertainer as well as songwriter,
she just never appealed to me.

Why don't I like Buffy Sainte-
Marie? Well, for one thing, her
voice has a tendency to be ir-
ritating, to my ears anyway. It

useems constantly on the verge

of breaking and I find myself
more worried about this and
less able to concentrate on her
songs. But, actually, without the
unique and not entirely melodic
vocal range she possesses, her
performance would be complete-
ly monotonous.

So there‘you have my ration-
alization for not enjoying the
concert. Personally, I thought
it was slow, boring—void of any
excitement. I've found that gen-
erally women folksingers with-
out accompaniment are not as
dynamic as the men, Buffy not
being one of the many excep-
tions to this generalization.

I also find it important to get
"psyched-up" for a concert and
listening to rock records as I
did does not put one in the
groove for her performance-—
my fault.

Although I did not enjoy her
performance, I was quite happy
with the concert. The audience
was wonderful—one of the best
I've ever soon. They really seem
to enjoy themselves and, there-
fore, as a critic, I would have
to say that the concert was ex-
tremely successful.

Also, to be congratulated
are the individuals who filled
in and kept the audience content
while they waited for Buffy
Saints-Marie. Unfortunagely, I ar-
rived late and Saw only the last
part of John Harrison's set and,
frankly. he was the highlight of
the evening as far as I was con-
cerned.

His voice is beautiful and he
has an excellent, professional
delivery. I am sorry i missed
his original numbers, but from
what I could derive, from the
people I talked with following
the concert, they were great.
I have had many comments on
"TheKCOnference" (Andy Nasal
and John Birchler) and Ed Sil-
ver, -. and, according to my
sources, both did good jobs of
filling in. '

Worthy of note is the upcom-
ins "Doors" concert December
8 at RPl. There is no sense
civics them any build-up; I think

A.

they have done a capable job on
their own. Nevertheless, I might
prove valuable to listen to their
second album, “Strange Days"
(Electra), which is far superior
to their first.

One of the first things you
will note is the inconsistency
in their performance, best ex-
emplified by their second single
"People Are Strange" one of
the worst and their current re-
lease "Love One Two Times”
one of the best pieces they have
ever done.

Guitarist Robby Kreiger has
to be the biggest surprise of
the set—he has improved so
greatly it is hard to believe he
is even the same person who
played on their first album.

Other outstanding selections
are the heavy Freudian “Moon-
light Drive" and "My Eyes Have
Seen You." The concert will
afford you the opportunity to see
probably the most successful
LA organization, and vocalist
Jim Morrison, who, if the word
be true, is an experience within
itself.

Another in the fine series of guest concerts
sponsored by the Music Council was performed
in Page Hall on Sunday afternoon prior to the
Thanksgiving recess. This was the famed East-

. man Wind Ensemble under the direction of Don-
ald Hunsberger. They played an extensive con-
cert ranging n'om Bach straight through to more
or less present thy composers.

One immediately noticeable feature was the

use of [works by composers whose names are
not as prominent in the public eye as ttnse of
(some of their well known contemporaries such
as Haydn, Beethoven, Chopin etc. This greatly
enhanced one's interest in the concert.
' A concert band performance cannot be describ-
ed as a moving emotional experience, so it easily
mils prey to a slightly bored audience. However,
when well performed such a concert can be highly
enjoyable, and such was the case with the East-
man Wind Ensemble performancé. This group
was formed in 1952, and for some time was under
the direction of the very well known Frederick
Fennel]. It numbers 50 instrumentalists who strive
to create according to the composer's wishes, and
are in part responsible for the emergence of many
new and original works;

The balance and quality of sound which radiates
from this group is very delightful. Through their
obviously careful interpretations which require
anything from pianissimos to surging volume and
sfortzandos with gongs, they performed with great
solidarity and noteable perfection. The percus-
sion section, as is often the case with many groups,
was very enjoyable to watch because of their demon-
stration of alertness, mobility and versatility.

One extremely important feature of wind en-
sembles in their brass section, and in the case
of the Eastman, it truly shone. During the Dello
.1010 number, I was particularly impressed with
the crystal clear yet solid sound which came
from the brass. One thing I was very thanka
of was that they did not attempt to stand dur-
ing the encore, “Stars and Stripes," because
this is so often messed up.

The performance opened with Bach’s chorale
“Komm, Susser Tod," translated into English
as "Come Sweet Death" which has been. most
popularly recorded by the Mormon Tabernacle
Choir. It was actually written as a song. At the

time of its composition, etch choraies for the
church ind great national importance, and Bach
wrote many of those using the organ as the back-
ground for his work. ,

The next piece was the "Symphony in F Major"
by Francois Joseph Cause, a relatively little-
heardof French composer, yet one who was very
popular, along with his contemporary, Mozart,
in in: Rocgcdopcriodu. Goseec was a writer-of
marc es patrio c songs and was eatly
attracted by the rise ofthe inns band arng
Frﬁm’h Revolution. .

Ensemble then performed “An Origin!
suite” by Gordon Jacob of the Royal College of
Music in London. He is perhaps best known for his
arrangements of works by other composers, and
the athptation of many of these for ballot.

The high spot of the afternoon was their bril-
liant performance of the “Symphony for Band,”
a composition by Robert Washburn, one ofthe
Eastman School's own graduates. Washburn is
presently head of the music department at the
Crane School at Potsrhm State.

The "Overture to Colas Breugnon” by Dmitri
Kabalevsky followed the intermission. Kabalevsky
is presently a professor at the Moscow Concern-
tory, and one of Russia’s most prominent com-
posers. He has given concerts in this cotmtryes
a part of the cultural encliange tours between
the United States and Russia.

“In Dulci Jubilo" is a tune which has been
used many times since the l'lth century as a
theme for variation, and its become most popu-
lar perhaps as a Christh cantata number.
The variation performed by the Ensemble was
tilt of Norman Dello Joio who composed five
variations, each having a different and delightful
characteristic all its own, and incorporated them
into one five movement piece.

The "Fiesta Del Pacifico” is a rather short
composition which describes the joyous events
revolving around the annual festival in Cali-
fornia celebrating the mys of Spanish occupa-
tion of that state. Roger Nixon, its composer,
is a professor at the San Francisco State college.

It was a rather lengthy concert, and I did feel
that the Nixon number could have been quite suc-
cessfully omitted. However, they presented us
with a truly enjoyable performance.
