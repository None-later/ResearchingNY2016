"Cool Hand Luke" (Strand
Theatre) seems to sell out twice;
once by setting its story in a
Georgia chaingang, where the
convicts look at first as cliche
as the Dirty Dozen; and again,
by showing the escaped Luke
(Paul Newman) having a dialogue
with God while bloodhounds and
sadistic guards are tracking him
down. But the movie never real-
ly sells out. Everything is as
sharp, confident, and poised as
Luke himself.

He is one of those aimless,
drifting young bloods, church-
key perpetually dangling from a
string round his neck. Arrested
for wrenching heads off parking
meters (just for the hell of it)
he is sentenced to chain-gang in-
bar.

Through various charged con-
frontations with his fellow pris-
oners and the guards,he emerges
as the one indomitany rebelli-
ous figure in the camp, and the
other convicts begin to nourish
their spirits from his. One day
Luke sees his chance, and es-
capes; he is caught; he escapes
again and is caught again.

Spirit Broker-

Now his captors set out to
break his spirit, without laying
a hand on him, and they suc-
ceed. But through a pure cus-
sadness in his nature, he es-
capes yet again, and this time
the guards settle the matter.
He is killed. But the epilogue
makes it clear that he is quick-
ly becoming a legend to the pris-
oners, and so by osmosis each
can bolster his own dignity.

From the very first pair of
shots — a flash of a night sky
and then a screen-filling close-
up of a parking meter’s "V10-
LATiON" snapping into view —
to the final view of the prison-
ers, director Stuart Rosenberg
is in utter command of his ma-
terial. Few directors have so
accurately caught the tensions.
and camaraderie among men un-
der pressure that we see in "Cool
Hand Luke."

The silhouette shots of the
convicts on the road in the broil-
ing midday have the intensity
of an inferno, and the claus-
trophobic compositions in the
barracks — fans, bare bulbs,
webs ' of wire and bars and

'chains — convey Rosenberg's

metaphor of the world asachaln-
gang camp, where all defiance
is doomed.
Newman Suits Port

Newman suits the part per-
fectly; since "The Hustler" he
has been an actor as well as a
star. tie is surrounded by ex-
perienced TV people who bring
to life roles that could become
trite — thus dispelling sellout
No. i, No. 2, Newman's final
dialogue with God in concert-
ed backwoods church, looks like
a preparation for the script-

writers' letting Luke escape; at
this point it would have been easy
(and fatal) to devise a deus ex
machina.

But the film remains true to
itself, and Luke ends the only
way he could —- shot by the most
chilling figure in the film, a
tall, silent, remorselessly ef-
ficient guard with opaque dark
glasses.

Even the weakest sequence has
power: the epilogue, where Drag-
line reminisces about Luke and
we resee previous shots of his
indomitable smile, seems mawk-
ish until it suddenly closes
with a still picture of that smile
— ripped in half. The few faults
(an overlong dialogue between
Luke and his mother, somewhat
self - conscious Christ sym-
bolism) are minor. "Cool Hand
Luke" seems to me one of the
best films to come out of l-iol-t
lywood in a long time.

‘Toming of Shrew'

As everyone knows, "Taming
of the Shrew" (Madison) is full
of bounce, swirl, rant, broad
laughs, and strenuous visual
antics. Elizabeth Taylor is sat-
isfactory, but often reads her
lines as if she were playing
Lady Macbeth. Her husband gives
Petruchio's part a lot of abu-
sive swagger, relying mostly on
that patented lecherous Burton
chuckle. The rest of the cast
is splendidly hammy.

Director Franco Zefiirelli was
not made for film: too many
of his action shots burst into
visual chaos. More seriously,
despite the frantic attempts at
"opening up," the play is not
expanded into cinematic space
and imagery, as is, say "Fal-
staff." — All of which doesn't
sound as if i enjoyed the film
as much as ldid. No, l’m not
sure if it all adds up to any-
thing, but it certainly is fun to
watch.

Note of unusual interest: “The
War Game" is coming to Albany
(Delaware Theatre) next Wednes-
day for a week accompanied by
“Dr. Strangelove."

Frankonis’;

by Robert Cutty'

"Muriel? . . Muriel, l'm
sorry. i think we frightened
you. i didn't mean to. Forgive
me? . . . i really apologize.
Forgive me? . . . Please? Dea-
gle domen?"

with these words, William A.
Frankonis, in his one-act play,
"A Piece of Cake," or“'The
Sound of Deagle Domen in Your
Ears," begins a casual inter-
ruption in a spasm of careless
violence.

Frankonis' play deals with the
fragile love-hate-need relation-
ship that.exists between a man
and his wife, George and Mur-
iel, respectively. George loves
Muriel, yes, but is insistent up-
on being the dominant element
in his household.

But George' is the traditional
boy-man (the physically mature
male-child, with the emotions
and conscience of an adolescent)
of American literary fame and
historical myth. ‘

Thus, there is only one way
in which George can assert his
masculinity: the game of war.
George plays the game by hav-
ing Muriel and himself tellstor-
ies to each other about their
pasts. The better stories re-
ceive a point each.

George's story is typically
masculine: it is filled with vio-
lence and told in an aura of
pain, further the point of
George's story is clearly todeny
the permanence and purity of
love.

But Muriel wins the game by
using her typical female wiles:
cunning is displayed in her first‘
story (which insists that love as
an emotional need must include
some overtones of physical an-

ger .
Another feminine trait, sen-
timent, is Muriel's weapon in
her second tale (which insists
that the child becomes an ad-
ult by understanding the human
conflicts, both internal and ex,-

ternal, inherent to the human .

relationship).

George, in a childish fit of
rage, accuses Muriel of having
denied his manhood by winning
the game and the verbal duel be-
comes a physical attack.

George, to prove his belief
that love is insincere, deceives
Muriel into believing that he
has forgiven her for winning the
game. When she shyly agrees
to a reconciliation, George bru-
tally kills her in a fit of wild
passion.

But George needs Muriel; he
must have a woman to love and
hate who will accept his domi-

George, in his desperation,
reaches into the audience to find
a replacement for Muriel. His
success or failure in this ven-
ture is finally dependent uponthe

‘ person George chooses in the

audience to become Muriel’s
successor.

Frankonis, who directed, stag-
ed the play by utilizing the total
theater (Richardson 291) as the

' stage. George (Deftly portrayed
by Jay Kuperman) and Muriel
(enacted skillfully by Beth Sabo-
witz) roam throughout the thea-
ter, spying likely subjects to
chat with.

The three stories that make
up the game are related in this
manner, Beth casually relaxed

ing vigorously in a halo of red
light. ~

and acted. further benefits from

being so finely written. A spring
morning is so clear and yellow
that "you can smell the sun.”

His description of a man burn-
ing to death is fraught with pain;
"Just a ball of flame, and ev-
erywhere around that torch are
little squlds of fire onthe ground,
as if candles had been driven in-
to the earth and lighted."

lie details the vision of a tu-
berculosis victim: "A little
shrivel'ed man in white paja~
mas with blue pin stripes . . .
his skin was the color of a very
old white shirt that had yellow-
ed, and it looked like it would
feel like soft putty if i were to
touch it." ‘

Witty and poignant, chilling
and meaningful, these are the
proper words to sum up the to-
tal atmosphere of Frankonis’ dra-

' ma. And, to those people in the
audience on the four nights of
production, Frankonis’ direction
was an exciting theatrical inno-
vation.

 

A COLLECTION OF modern ion posters are presently on
exhibit in the Fine Arts Building. . .

Jazz Posters On Display
In Fine Art Gallery

An exhibition of JAZZ
POSTERS opens in the Gallery
Lounge of the Fine Arts Build-
ing on November 27, and will
remain there until December 17,
1967. The 44 posters, represent-
ing 12 countries, are being cir-
culated by the Smithsonian in-
stitution. They are lent by the
New Orleans Jazz Museum and
Archives.

The art of the poster has been
developing for centuries, starting
with the earliest graffiti. By the
late nineteenth century theatrical
producers realized the value of
striking, artistically designed
posters. And in the entire his-
tory of theatrical posters, none
have been more provocative than
those designed to publicize jazz
artists and concerts. For here
is one subject, above all others,
where the artist can give full
vent to his imagination.

The posters in this exhibition
range from the very sophis-
ticated, such as those done by
the German‘ design team of
Michel and Kaiser for the Ger-
man tours of famous American
jazz groups, to the simple, hand-
lettered poster made by the Jazz
Club in Katowice, Poland to pub-
licize a talk given by Mr. H.
Clay Watson, Director of the
New Orleans Jazz Museum, dur-
ing his 1085 State Department
sponsored tour of Eastern
Europe. I

Michel and Kieser's posters
for the tours of Duke Ellington
the Oscar Peterson Trio, and
Ella Fritzgeraid, among others,
are

shapes, and a dramatic, almost
musical feeling of movement.
Their posters for the l964 through
1968 American Folk Blues festir
vale in Berlin have a completely
different feeling. Done in color,
they are boisterous, almost rau-
cous, in the manner in which
they convey the feeling of the
festivals. One, with the primary
design a multi-colored guitar,
has the names and photos of
the artists superimposed on it
like a collage, bold and bright.

The Polish and Czecho-
slovakian posters are more
subtle than the German ones,
and tend to be more abstract.
The Japanese posters catch the
eye because of a striking juxp
taposition of Western jazz sym-
bols—drawings of instruments
and musiciansandJapanese char-
acters used to announce the place
and time of the concerts.

The New Orleans Jazz Museum
and Archives, which lent these
posters for the two year tour,
has for the five years of its
existence had a program of cab
lecting material and data con-
cerning jazz activities around the
world. Generally this consists of
as programs, photographs,
periodicals, and recordings and
taped performances. But also of
historical importance is the pos-
ter collection from which this
show has been drawn. in these
posters are reﬂected the style,
times, and artistic tastes of the
nations and peoples they re-
present Jazz is truly the uni-
versal voice of free expression.
And in these posters we can
see its marvelous influence
through the eyes of theseartists.

This weekend the Albany State cagers and grap-
plers will open their respective seasons with a ﬂour-
ish of activity. The basketball squad will be featured
in'a pair of doubleheaders today and tomorrow, while

J the wrestlers Will host their third annual Quadrangu-
lar on Saturday.

Both these events represent a step up for the Albany
teams. The Cagers will be facing RP] and Williams,
two teams that are not to be takenlightiy while the Grap-
plers will be defending their quadrangular title against
a rugged group of challengers. Hartwick finished third
last year and will be back for another try. The other
contestants will be University of Rochester and Dart-
mouth College, both of whom could prove to bevery
tough.

Friday's doubleheader, Saturday's Quadrangular, and

) ‘ Saturday's doubleheader, were expected to accompany
the formal opening of the new gym, however, such is
not the case. Unfortunately we have to host these fine
visiting squads in Cardinal McCloskey Gym and in the
confines of old Page Hall. Although this set-up is far
from adequate, there is little that can be done about it
so we will just have to bear with it.

The spectator appeal however; is not diminished
by the location, and the competition this weekend will
be about as stiff as either squad is likely to face
this season. This weekend's competition should also
give a pretty good indication of what to expect for
the remainder of the season. Both teams are some-
what untried, as transfers are manning important spots
on both squads, so these somewhat untested individuals
will be making their debuts in important situations.

Another aspect of University sports will also be get-
ting under way this weekend, as intramural basketball
begins Sunday. The whole intramural set-up will have
a new look this year, as League 1 has been expanded
from six teams to two divisions of seven teams each.
League II will still have two divisions (six teams to
a division) and League 111 will eXpand to three divisions,
while League 1V is set with one division. All this expan-
sion is indicative of both the expansion of the Univer-
sity and of the increased interest in intramurals.

Once again the lack of facilities will be a handicap,
since Page Hall is all that is available, and it is heavily
scheduled with social events due to the expected com-
pletion of the new gym. Thus the intramural program
will once again be handicapped. However, one of the old
disadvantages may be somewhat alleviated. The officiat-
ing is likely to improve. This years football officials
weren't good, but they were markedly improved over last
year. Dr. Werner’s new system of clinics before the
season, followed by increased pay for continued service,
' . does not result in professional work, (which is impossible

anyway) but at least the officials now have a working
knowledge of the basic rules.

In Quadrangular. . Tomorrow .

Dartmouth College, University of Rochester and Hartwick College will provide the
opposition Saturday as the Albany Gtapplers host their third annual Albany‘Quadrangu-
lar Tournament. The meet will be held in Page Hall on the Old Campus and“ will get ‘
under way at 1 pm. The Great Danes will be out to defend their decisive win of last 
year, when they captured six of eleven first place spots. Dartmouth and Rochester
are new Tournament entries, while Hartwick finished third last year. ' ‘ '

Albany has three champions returning. Bill Russell captured the 115 pound class
last year, and Frank Berry and Roger Gorham were winners at 160 and 177 respec-
tively. Berry and Gorham are expected to be defending their titles, but Russell has
put on some weight and will probably be competing at 130. Other potential winners.
for the Joe Garcia coached Great Danes include Erik Watts at 123, Co-captain Craig
Springer at 152, and junior college transfer Francis Weal at 145 pounds.

Watts, a transfer from Syracuse, was a State champion in high school, but he has

been away from the mats for quite sometime, so he may be a little bit rusty.

Springer Looks Good

Springer was barely
beaten out of the 152
crown last year, and he
went on to post a fine

6-3-2 dual meet record,
so he too is looked to for a win.

Weal has looked good in early
workouts, but he is still untested
under fire. Others who may be
point winners in the tourmment
and during the year include sen-
ior ietterman Bill Clark, junior
Gary Smagalski, sophomore Rog-
er Saul, sophomore Marshal
Gladstone, and possibly junior
Paul DeBsrbieri.

Clark will probably be going
at 137, and he is expected to
improve on the 4-4 record that
he recorded as a swing man last
year. Smagalski did not wrestle
last year, but he showed con-
siderable promise as freshmen.
He is in contention for the 130
spot.

Novices at I67 and I9]

Saul and Gladstone are both
novices, as neither wrestled as
freshmen. Gladstone will be going
at 167 while Saul who was re-
cruited from the soccer team
will go at the optional weight
of 191.

DeBarbieri is Garcia's unlim-
ited wrestler as of now, but his
eligibility is still uncertain. If
he is not cleared the Great Danes
will be in the lamentable posi-
tion of having to forfeit both
115 and Unlimited.
