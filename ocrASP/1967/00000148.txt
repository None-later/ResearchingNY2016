" 'The’ Greatgnane basketball season opens tonightwhen

RPl‘s Engineers come into the Cardinal McCloskey gym

.to meet our _ nomadic Sauersmen. The long seasonwill

put our hoop team to the test 'once again, and a predic-
tion that the hoopers will shine can be considereda
safe one. But how will our fans do? A surprise to most
of you is. that the Albany fans wiilbe put to the test
also. in fact,- for the last two, basketball seasons, col-
leges belonging to the Eastern Collegiate Athletic As-
sociation have had their fans rated by the working of-
ficials. The quality rated was sportsmanship — com-
mon courtesy to opposing teams. With the less than
overpowering attendance at basketball games, it was
quite a surprise to learn that the small number of
fans which did turn out to the ball games made their
resence quite unimpressively felt. During the 1965-
6 season, out of the 184 schools rated, SUNYA ranked
67th from the bottom, and only a rise to mediocrity was
made in ’66-’67 when we boomed to the middle of the

198 schools rated.

it makes one wonder if sports editors have been argu-
ing for the wrong cause all these years. instead of ask-
ing for more student support at athletic events,perhaps
we should be thankful that only a small number of stu-
dents are ambitious enough to show off their poor
manners. To be truthful, i, personally, have never notic-
ed any unusual unsportsmanlike conduct by the SUNYA
fans, but according to these statistics, it is obvious
there is a lot of room for improvement.

Courtesy is something which should be a habit, not an
act which you should be conscious of performing. Being
far from the perfect gentleman, I still see no great
energy waste in applauding for an opposing player when
being called to the bench, or applauding a fine play by
an opponent. Cheers are always welcomed, but not dur-
ing an opponent’s free throw. it is ridiculous to point
out a code for fans. You are all familiar with common
courtesy, and basketball games this year will provide
a perfect opportunity for all of us to display this

quality.

A winning team will give us a lot to cheer about this
year, and shouts at the right time mixed with silence
at the correct moment might bring our university two

winners, a
body .

1 Friday, December 1', 1967 ~

(

by Don Oppediseno

Just how good is the 1967-1969
Albany State University-basket-
ball team? This long-awaited
question will be emphatically re-
solved tonight and tomorrow when
the Great Danes host RPl, the
Coast Guard Academy, and Wil-
liams College _in a weekend
doubleheader at the Cardinal Mc-
Closkey High School gym.

Albany area fans will be in for
a rare treat as they will witness
back-toback doubleheaders both
evenings. At 6:30 p.m. Friday,
Coast Guard will meet Williams,
while at 8:15 the home-standing
Danes will face the Engineers
from Troy. Saturday, RPl will
vie against the Coast Guardwhlle
Albany meets Williams. Game
times will again be 6:30 and
8:30 p.m.

RP] and Williams both are
formidable opponents, and how
the Sauersmen perform against
them will go a long way in deter-
mining the strength of the squad.

As usual, the Albany edition
will be talented and'ready'for
action. Coach Dick Sauers has
six lettermen returning from last
year's 15-7 club, the top scorer
from the '66-67 Albany freshman
team and a fine array of five
transfer students.

The three men Sauers will
build his team around are juniors
Rich Margison and Scott Price
and senior captain Larry Marcus.
Margison led the varsity inscor-
ing as soph last year and is a
picture player and an excellent
ballhandler and rebounder in
addition to scoring proficiently.
' Whereas Margison impresses
observers with his ﬂuidity, Price
has the size and strength to
dominate a game physically.
Price has exceptional jumping
ability and competes success-
fully with opponents several
inches taller.

Margison's corner mate at the
other forward position probably
will be Marcus, a three-year
veteran. One of the team’s best

outside shots, Marcus averaged'

double figures as a soph and will
be counted on to so do again.

Probably the best of the new-
comers are Bob Wood and Jim
Caverly. Wood is an excellent
shooter and good ballhandler
while Caverly will be called upon
to fill J lm Constantine's shoesas
floor general. It wouldn't sur-
prise many people if Wood and
Caverly were in the startingline-
up tonight.

With a combination of a rich
crop of home-grown productst
a talented group oftransfers, you
can see why Dick Sauers is quiet-
ly optimistic about the approach-
ing season.

BANY, new R
Open Letter Given
To Pres. Collins

By War Committee

President Evan R. Collins was
presented twice with the open
letter addressed to him in the
"Objector" at his weekly con-
ference with students.

First, the President was hand-
ed an issue of the publication by
one of the students at the con-
ference. After President Collins
glanced over the letter a member
of the Student-Faculty Committee
to End the War in Vietnam pre-
sented him with the sealed letter,
which the President indicated
should have been seen before.

The letter asked the President
to “publically and explicitly con-
demn the general's directive as
both a threat to the freedom to
dissent and a violation of the
democratic concept of justice."

The committee also asked the
President to “take action against
the General by barring further
recruitment on campus." Presi-
dent Collins noted that it was an
“interesting device” to publish
an open letter before he received

The representative from the
End the War group apologized for
the faux pas, and explained that
the committee had planned to
deliver the letter in the morning
but thought his office was on the
new campus. Consequently, the
letter wasn't delivered until the
conference.

The President stated that he
was in favor of protest, butthere
was one kind of protest he was
determined to stop and another
he was determined to preserve.

The President expressed his
disapproval of the type of de-
monstration that would infrifue
upon the right of self expression
and free inquiry of others.

President Collins also stated
he would not be able to reply to
the letter of the End the War
Committee since he did not pos-
sibly have time to study it.

Although PresidentCollins dis-
agreed with the tactics of General
Lewis B. Hershey he also dis-
agreed with those of the people
who wish to bar recruiting on
campus.

Such an action, according to the
President. would interfere with
intellectual freedom of and im-
pose a censorship on the Univer-
sity community. The University
is, stated the President, one of
the few places where intellectual
freedom can be found. Collins
views the preservation of this
freedom a special responsibility.

FOMIW AT 6:30 in the morning, draft protesters turned
in 46 complicity statements. Six draft cards were refused by
the Federal Marshal at the induction center.

Protesters Turn In
Cumplicity Statements

by Jill Poznilt
Staff Reporter

"Due to the aggressive nature
of American Foreign policy, 1,
— do hereby declare
that I will knowingly aid, counsel
and abet any young man torefuse
or evade registration or service
in the armed forces of the United
States of America.

"1 further declare that l have
knowingly aided and counseled
young men to refuse to comply
with the regulations of the Uni-
versal Military Training and
Service Act of 1967 and 1 will
continue to support those men
who turn in their draft cards,
burn or mutilate their draft
cards."

This is the complicity state
ment of which there were forty-
six handed to Federal Marshal
Bryne during the course of the
anti-draft protest march Monday
morning, Dec. 4.

Shouts of “Keep Americabeau-
tiful—get a haircut” and " Keep
walking till you dr0p dead" greet-
ed draft protesters at the induc-
tion Center on Broadway.

Mark Rosenberg, leader of the
Resistance at Bard College, and
a small contingent from that
school arrived on the scene at
about 9:30. He asked to see the
Federal Marshal in order to
transact some business. He made
no statement as to the content of
this transaction.

Deputy Marshal Brinkman, who
stayed on the scene in front of
the Induction Center, “to protect
these people against them-
selves," said that the Marshal
would meet the protestors on the
steps outside the Center at
10:00 a.m.

When the time came, however,
a select group of protesters in-
cluding Rosenberg were escorted
by the Deputy Marshal to the
Marshal's office where Marshal
Byrne was asde by Rosenberg
to accept the 40 complicity state-
ments and six draft cards.

Marshall Byrne accepted the
statements and Rosenberg's per-
sonal declaration, howaver, he
refused to accept the draft cards
saying that, as far as he knew,
the draft card must be given up

 

by the person to whom it was
issued.

The Marshal stated that he
would accept any written com-
munications other than draft
cards. (The penalty for signing

Golden Eye To Present

Carson Satire, ‘MacBird’

The Golden Eye will present
Barbara Carson's "MacBirdl"
tonight. The play is a personal
and political satire on the Ken-
nedys (Ken O'Duncs) and the
Johnsons (MacBirds).

Directed by Alex Krakower
and his assistants Stratton Raw-
son and Dan Stimmerman, the
production will be done in
a "Reader's Theatre" style. This
method will be achieved by the
“actors” reading the dialogue
but not physically interacting with
each other.

The dramatic reading will be
accompanied with musical ef-
fects. This method of production
is designed to leave more up to
the imagination of the audience.

A parody on "Macbeth," the
personalities of the real Kennedy-
Johnson situation are paralleled
with the characters of Shakes-
peare's tragedy. The situation
here, however, are the events
leading up to and following the
assassination of the King (Pres-
ident).

The comedy is drawn from the
parody element; the satire is
from the light in which the char-
acters are portrayed. Both the
Ken O'Doncs and the MacBlrds
are devastated by the bitter sa-
tire.

Krakower feels that only the
cynical observer of the Kennedy-
Johnson situation will be able to
view the play with complete
s 00- The Kennedy and-or John-
son fans on the other hand, will
feel the brunt of the satire. No
one is spared; everyone in the
political arena is the target of
Mrs. Carson's play.

The main characters of "Mac-
Bird" (LB!) and Robert Ken
O’Done (RFK) will be played by

William Rohde and MlchaelRuth-
erford respectively. Also includ-
ed in the cast are Stuart Solo-
man, Don Terry, Beth Sabowitz,
Phillip King, Jay Kuperman, El-
len Rogers, Joyce Levy, Steve
Brockhouse, and Bob Cutty.

The Golden Eye will present
the three act play at 9 o'clock.
It is situated at the MadisonAve.
Presbyterian C hurch at 820 Madi-
son Ave.
