Albany Sailing Club

To Promote Recreation

by Judy Levlnsolln

The newly formed Sailing Club
at the University is holding its
next meeting on Wednesday, Dec.
13 in the Physics lounge at 7:30
p.m. All interested students are
or wuraged to attend the meeting
or content Charles Bowman, the
president of the club.

The Albany Selling Club ap-
plied for membership in the Mid-
dle Atlantic Intercollegiate

ailing Association. They hope
to sail against Harvard, Army,
Navy, Cornell, and other mem-
bers of this organization in the
near future.

Three types of boats, re-

creational, training, and competi-
tive are used by the club. Pro-
fessor Curtis L. Hemmingwey of
the Department ofAstronomyand
Space Science at State has agreed
to act as an adviser to the club.

The constitution of the Uni-
versity Sailing Club states the
general purposes of the club in
its preamble. 'lhese purposesin-
elude promoting selling as a re.
creational activity among the
students and faculty oi the Uni.
versity, assisting members in
sailing, and encouraging inter-
collegiate and intramural sall-
boat racing with sailing clubs
of other colleges and uni-
versities.

ems D. Ellis Director of
Traffic Safety Education ea-
pnued a feeling that one of
a. greatest social lll'obkml
today is the loss at human and
economic resources throw! In"
its accidents.

lie feels that unless a maiol‘
breakthrough in the number oi
high school pupils who graduate
from formal tratiic safety edu-
catio a double in the
next five years, the tragedy Wm
continue to increase in severity.

Federal andState Governments
and local school districts are
making an allvout effort to meet
the challenge. To meet the needs
of the high school pupil, schools
are doubling the number of teach-
ers in their programs and the
few schools withoutprograms are
employing new teachers as fast
as they are available.

The problem lies in that the
present supply of qualified teach-
ers does not meet the demand
and needs oi the local school dis-
tricts. There were at least 25
traffic safety education positions
in New York state which were
not filled at the beginning of the
1967-88 school year.

Ellis feels that University Jun-
iors and Seniors who have
driver's licenses and are on-
rolled in programs leading to
secondary certification should
give every proservice preparer
tion program (TSP 450 and TSP
451) for teaching traffic safety
education (including preparation
for and student teaching on the

simulator and multiple vehicle '

laboratories).

_ rompts LAAC, C.C. Action.

by Vic Leopev

Central Council passed a
11, based on
the solid support oi the student
body, requests that the University
officials no longer require that
resident students enter into a
Board contract unless they wish
to do so, at the Thursday, Nov.
30 meeting. .

The resolution also requests
a re-evaluation of the present
meal plan; and designates Living
Area Affairs Commission

" (LAAC) to offer specific recom-

mendations to the appropriate
persons, subject to the approval
of Council.

The resolution is the direct
result of a poll that LAAC took a
number of weeks ago to deter-
mine student opinion on the pre-
sent board policy and other fea-
sible alternative policies.

As it now stands, ii a student
lives in the dorm he must also
enter into a Board contract for
meals. There are very few ex-
ceptions to this rule; the major
exception offered for re-
ligious reasons. Approximately
90 per cent of the resident stu-
dents responded to the poll. 80
per cent were for separation of
room and board. These figures
are based on incomplete returns.

LAAC was instructed to come
up with a specific plan, since
there were a number of plans

IF G Film ,‘Joan’

Demonlsm, witchcralt, and re-
ligious mysticism are the ele
ments of tonight's IFG film,
"Mother Joan of the Angels."

Winner of several European
festival prizes, the film por-
trays a Mother Superior report-
edly possessed by Satanic do
mons. Priests who have attempt-
ed to reform her have beenburn<
ed at the stake, and minor dc-
mons are beginning to control the
other convent nuns.

Director Jerry Kawalerowicz
has sald, "The film is a. protest
against all dogmatism, whatever
it is, but at the same time it is
about love. . . The devils and
the nuns constitute nothing but
a pretext. What really counts is
the clash in man's aspirations
which I have tried to portray."
Possession and madness are
nothing but revolts of human na—
ture against old allies and con-
formities we are forced to put
up with.”

offered in the poll. Whatever
plan they decide on will have to
be approved by Council and the
University. -

Council also passed another
resolution which will urge Presi-
dent Collins and Dr. Thorns to
call a meeting of the Alcohol

‘ Committee to consider the ques-

tion of allowing alcohol in the
dorms.

When the committee made their
recommendations, the alcohol in
the dorms policy was not fully
resolved. This resolution was
passed by a huge margin andwiih
very little debate.

Council also acted on anumher
of other items. A discussion of
write-in votes was held to deter-
mine whether they shouid be
allowed in elections or not. This
was brought before Council be-
cause the Election Commission
was split over the matter.

The major argument for write-
in votes was that the student
should have the right to vote for
anyone they want to whether they
were on the ballot or not.

Opposing arguments were bas-
ed on the fact that there was self-
nomination and lie person wanted
to run he could simply nominate
himself. Furthermore, most
write. in candidates have very

little chance of winning. '

This was countered by Paul
Breslin who stated that last year
there was no candidate on the
ballot for Treasurer of theCiase
of '69 and therefore a write-in
vote was necessary to fill the
position. , _

A statement was made that
write-in votes be accepted unless
the election involved screening
e.g. MYSKANIAandWho’sWhoor'
if the write-in candidate did not
have the necessary qualifications
e.g. a sub 2.0 ciun or did not
belong to thaStudent Association.

Vice President Paul Downes,
chairman of thestudent Tax Com-
mittee said that he had a new
student tax. listing which stated
that as of Oct. 31, 4,315 students
had paid the tax. 69.5 per cent
of the undergraduates have paid
the tax. This represents
$94,863.10 in revenue which was
taken in and of this about $60,000
comes to the S.A.

Council appropriated $328 to
the Young Americans for Free-
dom, and approved the Athletic
Advisory Board rules. President
Jeff Mishkin announced that Greg
Hicks had resigned. This will
create a vacancy onCouncil from
Colonial Quad which will have to
be filled by a replacement
election.
