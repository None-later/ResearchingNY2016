: State Conlflimty"
(Cent'd from _ age I)

a complicity statement inquire-

lent to  card burning— up

to fiveyeers inprisoosndarup

The groip assembled in the
Ma'rshel’s office, including Baa
Kelish and Norm Early of SDS
at State, was Interviewed by a
number of reporters including
those from WPTR and WTRY.

Rosenberg stated during this
interview that he had turned in
his draft card attheJustice Dept.
in Washington «I Oct. 00th. The
next day be burned his classifica-
tion card at the Pentegcn.0n0ot.
24 he was visited by FBI agents
whose questions went, for the
.most part, unanswered.

He had been classified 28 until
June of this year when his classi-
fication expired. He has .natbeen
notified further by a government
agency. All this was stated inhis
personal declaration handed to
the Marshal.

0f the six draft cards, Rosen-
berg explained that one came
from an Episcopal minister and
two others from Vietnam war
veterans.

Although their numbers were
small, their spirit and signs
compensated. The chant "Hell
no, we won't go" was repeated
every once in awhile and when
they weren't yelling, their signs
expressed their purpose and
thoughts such as “The Dave Has
Torn its Wing."

The main doors ofthelnduction
Center facing Broadway were
closed to the public and only
employes andthose having papers
indicating. that they were required
to transact official business at the
Center were permitted to enter
through a guarded side door.

When asked what she thought
of the protest, one female em-
ploye in an olive drab uniform
said she had been in the service
twenty-four years andshe thought
the protest was sickening.

A man reporting for his induc-
tion said ofthe objectors, “lfthey
went to try and end the war let
them go ahead, i feel that this
country has been good to me and
if they need me to fight for it,
i am going to."

inion inside the post office
next to the induction Center was
unanimously against the protest.-
ors. At the window of one teller

a men commentted that 1w? are

try now tosoppeope rom

heinmg' killed later. We are killing
now to prevent the spread of
communism.”

Another saidthe"Though some
of our men are getting killed, we
are trying to stop the spread of
communism therefore staying
there is the lesser of twoevils.”

When asked why he burned his
draft card Rosenberg stated that
it was, “in protest to American
Foreign Policy." He called the
policy of the United States in
Vietnam “duplicitous, imperial-
istic, totalitarian and ex-
ploitive."

He believes that "the United
States is headed toward a col-
lision course and there is only
one way out and that is with-
drawai."

Deputy Marshal Brinkman
commented later on his personal
views. He said "i was born and
raised in this country. i love it
the way it is." When questioned
as to whether this applied to
government policies also, Brink;-

man said, “i like the government
the way it is; if it were any
different people wouldn’t be
getting away with what they are

(Steve D’Arosicn, CP's
man in Saigon stopped off in
Moscow on his way to Viet-
nam. While there he talked to
a North Vietnamese govern-
ment ofﬁcial about their
views on the war and about
prospects for peace. The
abbreviation DRV used
throughout the article stands
for the Democratic Republic
of Vietnam, official title of
North Vietnam.)

Although it is clear that the
North Vietnamese do not trust
the U.S. govsrnment lfound it
relatively easy to talk to the
North Vietnamese representative
I met with on two occasions
here. He agreed to see me be-
cause I came as a representa-
tive of the college press —
the North Vietnamese are very
much aware of opposition to the
war among college students.

All in all, i talked with the
First Secretary of the DEV, Do
Kiem, for about five hours. He
spoke Vietnamese, an attache
translated into Russian and my
lntourist guide translated into
English. We drank green Viet-
namese tea and smoked Dien
Bien Phu cigarettes. Do Kiem
was extremely gracious through-
out our discussions.

i went to our first meeting
prepared with specific questions
about the technicalities of nego-
tiations. Some of these were
touched upon at our second meet-
ing, others were ignored. it is
my general impression that once
the DRV is convinced the Unit-
all states sincerely wants peace,
these difficulties can be sur-
mounted.

Americans should realize,
whether it is true or not — at
this point i have no way of know-
ing -— tint the North Vietna-
mese believe they are winning
the war militarily.

in the last two years, the
Secretary said, the balance of
power has shifted. He believes

With North Vietnamese

the DRV and NLF‘ forces now
have the advantage. In the last
five months, the DRV claims to
have killed 150,000 troops, of
which 70,000 were Americans.
They also claim to have stale.
mated U.S. offensive operations.

80 Kiem said that 2,407 Amer-
ican aircraft had been downed
by DEV or NFL fire. This fig.
ure includes 43 types ofeircraft,
including 352's. Later 1 saw an
edition of the Herald Tribune,
still published in Paris which
said we had admitted to 2,709
losses, but tilt not all the loss-
es were due to enemy fire. The
First Secretary also said that
because captured pilots are now
often older men, and of higher
rank, the DHV believes the Unit-
ed States Mes a pilot shortage.

in spite of the heavy bombing
by US. planes, Do Kiem claims
rice production in the North has
been increasing, that industries
havs been started where there
were none before, and that "the
educational, cultural and medical
aspects of life are being de-
veloped” in a country with a
population of 18 million, five
million young people are in
school, including institutions of
higher learning, the First Sec-
retary said.

At the present time, Hanoi
and Haiphong have not been level-
ed. American attacks on the port
of Haiphong, lam told, have been
carefully executed so as not to
sink any foreign ships. Presum-
ably some targets in both cit-
ies are still restricted.

i asked Do Kiem whether the
North Vietnamese were prepar-
ed for the leveling of these cities
or for the possibility that all the
escalation is merely a prelude
to nuclear attacks on China it-
seif. My question was misinter-
preted to mean nuclear attacks
on North Vietnam. Do Kiem said
the North Vietnamese could ab-
sorb even that. “Modern weapons
are useless inVietnam," he said.

Later another journalist told
me theNorthVietnamese are pre-

pared for anything. They have al- '

ready written off Hanoi, a city
they regard as too French. They
have drawn up plans for s new
city.

"All the Vietnamese people
believe in the victory over Amer-
ican imperialism," Do Kiem
said. Their belief in eventual vic-
tory is bolstered by a 4,000-
year history of resistance tofor-
eign domination. "in the 12th and
13th centuries the Vietnamese
fought the Mongol invasions. Lat-
er it was the Chinese. More rc-
centiy we have ousted the Japan-
ese and then the French," Kiem
said. The North Vietnamese be-
lieve the Americans are just
another group of foreigners to
be expelled.

The theme of liberation, of the
just struggle for self-determina-
tion, recurs throughout the props-
ganda Do Kiem gave me. Ho
Chi ilinh has said, “nothing ls
more precious than a fight iorln-
dependence and freedom." These
North Vietnamese pamphlets as-
sert that the Vietnamese people
will win their right because of
“moral superiority." They place
considerable emphasis on non-
miliiary factors such as these,
and on programs such as land
redistribution, as the reasons
the superior morale is superior
to that of the Army of the Re-
public of Vietnam (ARVIN), whose
lack of morale has often been
noted in the U.S. press, and to
that of our own forces as well.

The acknowledged corrup-
tion of the Ky regime is n strong
motor in their favor, the North
Vietnamese believe. They see
the South Vietnamese government
as a mere puppet of Amerlcu
and say that without American
Support it would fall in 21 dd)!-

“The Saigon government is
like a stable in which the horses
are fighting for a piece of 1qu-
They are even ready to kill each
other for their own interests.
And the Army of South Vietnam
is helpless. They can'tevenpacl-
fy their backyard," Mr. Kiem
said, explaining that the libera-
tion movement has spread from
the countryside to the cities.

Jewish Students.
Socialize, Discuss
In Hillel, Atid

Hillel is the religious organi-
zation on the University campus
which serves the Jewish student.
Hillel provides a meeting place
for the Jewish students and offers
to them religious, social, and
cultural events.

Presently Hillel is going
through a period of reorganiza-
tion with the installment of two
new advisers, Dr. Cohen, pro-
fessor of Social Welfare, and
Mr. Frankel. Hillel has many
new and exciting ideas which
shall take shape in the near future‘
with the reorganization.

The University chapter of
Hillel meets once a month; while
"Perspectives," a discussion
group, meets every other Tues-
day night.

Atid is the theological dis-
cussion group of Hillel. in Hebrew
Atid means "future." This name
signifies that the group is com-
posed of students looking into the
future.

This semester's topic of disn
cussion is "Pirke Aboth”. which
mean “Sayings of the Fathers.”
"Pirke Aboth” is a. collection of
the ethical sayings of some sixty
rabbis who lived between 200
and 300 B.C. The discussions
are led by Mr. Philip Arian,
educational director of Temple
Israel in Albany.

Atid's activities have included
a dinner and lecture at Temple
Israel by Chiam Potak, author of
The Chosen.

Albany Atid is a chapter of the
national organization Atid which
has chapters on college campuses
throughout the United States and
in Canada.

. Newman. Society
Promotes Action
And Involvement

Newman Association has been
on campus at Albany for over
forty years. This Catholic stu-

“ dent parish is the offspring of a
defensive organization formed to
protect Catholic students from
overpowering outside inﬂuences.

with the concept of a threat to
faith gone, Newman has become
an action minded group involved
with social, cultural, educational
and religious aspects of a stu-
dent’s life.

More than its action as agroup,
Newman is interested in serving
as a catalyst to involve students
in university life. Through the
personal involvement of the stu-
dents Newman helps serve the
university community indirectly
as well as directly through its
own actions.

Newman provides worship
opportunities for its parishion-
ers. The social aspect of worship
is carried through Newman's
social and educational activities.

Clothing drives, a food for
India day as well as involvement
with other groups in Big Brother-
Big Sister and tutorial programs
are part of Newman's social
action.

Educational service to the stu-
dent and university community
provide lectures such as the
week of SEARCH and “What’s it
all about" series. Also under
educational opportunities is the
theology curriculum which pro-
vides for lectures and discus
sions to take the place of a uni-
versity curriculum in theology.

Newman is also involved in
activities such as sponsoring
mixers, discussions on music
such as the discussion of the
music of Simon and Gnrfunko.
for the benefit of the entire stu-
dent community.

School Of Social Welfare
Formed andMolded By Rice

by Gory Gelt

Begin with an idea. Then bring
in a man like Dr. Richardson
Rice to shape, form, and mold
that idea into a tangible reality.
in this manner the School of
Social Welfare at the University
had its origin.

in the spring of 1964, the School
was just an idea. Rice, who had
completed three and one-half
years with the United Nations as
an advisor to the Family and
Child Welfare division for the
U.A.R., began to coordinate the
School and pull together afaculty
and curriculum. Thirty students
were accepted from 80 appli-
cants for the first class. Today
there is an enrollment of 58
students.

The school's 'Buuetin’ states
that the ‘objective of the graduate
program is to educate for pro-
fessional social work service to
individuals, groups, and the com-
munity.” Dean Rice said thstone
third to one half the work by
the graduate students is done in
instruction centers throughout
the Albany - Schenectady - Troy
area.

Not only are the graduates
from the School ofSocial Welfare
going into social work, but they
are also trained for urban de-
velopment, community planning,
and criminal prevention projects.
The formation of social welfare
extends right up to the seat of
government, and includes such
things as economic and wealth
distribution.

Rice feels that a certain type
of personality is required to be-
come adept in the field of social
welfare. The social worker must

Religious Affairs
To Help Develop

All-Faith Center

The Commission for Religious
Affairs was organized to assist
members of the University com-
munity in their search for faith
and spiritual understanding.

During its first year of exis-
tence the Commission began to
strive for active involvement in
the discussion of pertinentmoral
and social issues that affect col-
lege life.

The Commission coordinates
and represents the concern of
its members within the Univer-
sity structure. At present, mem-
bership is composed of elected
representatives from the or-
ganized religious groups on
campus, appointed faculty and
clergy advisers.

Freshmen are oriented to the
religious activities on campus
through the Commission, which
distributes information about the
religious groups on campus and
the location of churches and
synagogues.

The Commission fosters an
ecumenical spirit among the
faiths through activities such as
the inter - Faith Thanksgiving
Festival, and is now studying
the future development of an
inter-Faith Center at the Uni-
versity.

like people, like working with
people, and have a concern for
people. "We are not training
technicians," stated Rice. “if
we become too technically orient-
ed we begin to treat people like
things. This we cannot do.”

Rice recently announced his
resignation of his administrative
position in the school. No suc-
cessor has been named yet but
Rice hopes that one will be found
before the end of this academic
year. Rice will continue on a
teaching basis to help develop the
potential of others and to continue
sharing his theory that "love is
not enough."
