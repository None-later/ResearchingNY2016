Selective Service System;
Reforms Ma Come in Future

a.
wasnniomu (CPS) — Al-
though Congress hasestended the
drut for four more years, the
Selective Service System still
may become a campein issue in
next year's Presidential election.
it is highly ﬂow that either
are Demosﬁiic or Republican

appears likely that one or. both
parties will propose a number
of reforms in the military sys-
tem which, among other ﬁlings.
may be aimed at reducing draft
calls to zero.

Such reforms would be de-
signed to encourage more young
people to volunteer for the Army
by making military service
appear more attractive. Themost
important reform would hate

wage level of civilian rates.

More Pay for Soldier!
Chances that increased payfor
soldiers win he acampaign issue
were boosted last week When a
Gallup poll showed that eight out
of ten persons favor such ,a plan.
When an issue has such awide
spread voter appeal, Presidential
candidates arenotlikely toignore

more popular in Congress.
Twenty-two Republican House
members recently issued a joint
statement advocating certain
military reforms, including an
increased pay scale, as a way
of reducing draft calls and put-
ting the armed forces on avolun-
teer basis.

The House already has taken
the initial step by passing a 5.6
per cent increase in basic pay
for the nation’s 3.5 million mili-
tary servicemen. The bill, which
would cost about $638 million in
the first year, is expected to
receive positive action in the

Big Question

The big question is whether or
not more young people will vo-
lunteer for the military ii Con-
gress and the Pentagon increase
the benefits for military per-
sonnel. Most observers agree
that military reforms will result
in an increased number of volun-
teers, but there is a disagree-
ment over whether there would
be enough volunteers to enddrait

At least five Congressmen
think an all-volunteer army is
indeed possible if the right im-
provements are made. Their

appear in s book entitled,
“How to End the Draft” which
was Mllehdd this

The Congressmen lat:ng
fie recommendations
say is “the first effort to define
systematically a specific pso-

sun .0: action Which 

to an volunteer service and
the elimination of draft calls."

They believe that if their re-
commendations are followed, an
all-volunteer service is possible
within two to five years. The
estimated total maximum cost
is $3.96 billion a year.

Republican Authors

Authors of the book are Re-
publicans Robert T. Stafford,
Frank J. Horton, Richard S. Sch-
weiker, Garner E. Shriver, and
Charles W. Whalen, Jr. They
emphasize they are not advocatv
ing that the Selective Service
System be abolished, but are
merely recommending reforms
which “individually andcollect-
ively can work to reduce thesise
of draft calls, hopefully down to
zero,” even under present cir-
cumstances.

But, says Douglas F. Bailey,
research director for the five
Congressmen, “if escalation of
the was continued, resulting in
the need for more servicemen,
there would still have to besome
draft.

“1 don't think we could getthat
many to volunteer. But 1 think
this plan will be effective in end-
ing the draft under the present
situation and particularly under
real peace-time circumstances.”

Defense's Actions

Many of the recommendations
require no Congressional action
and couldbeimplementedimmed-
iately by the Department of De
sense.

The major proposal needing
legislative action involves mili-
tary pay increases. “As long
as the beginning servicemen get
paid less then the minimum wage
required by law, there is no
hope of ever getting rid of the
draft," Rep. Stafford savs.

“if the military pay scales
are not made commensurate with
civilian pay scales, many young
men who may wish to serve may
not do so for they cannot afford
to make the financial sacrifice."

Necessary Legislation

Bailey predicts that the legis-
lation necessary toencourage the
all-volunteer service “will be
either passed next year or in
1969 under a Republican Presi-
dent and a new Congress."

One problem, he feels, is that
President Johnson win not want
to endorse the proposals since
they are being pushed by Repub-
licans. But he thinks Johnson
will push for them anyway ii
and when he feels it will be
to his political advantage. And
Bailey thinks that all the poten-
tial Republican candidates for
President will endorse the pro
pearls and strive for an all-
volunteer service.

In addition to reforming the
pay scale, the five Congressmen
are suggesting a. new program of
retirement benefits, expanded
educational programs, a higher
and fixed recruitment advertising
budget, and expansion of a pro-
gram to replace some noncombat
uniform personnel with civilians.

They also recommend require-
ments that standards of accept
ability for voluntary enlistment
not be more difficult than they
are for the draft.

The proposals of the Repub-
lican Congress could provide the
basis for a major issue in the
GOP platform. And if polls con-
tinue to indicate the overwhelm-
ing majority of the voters favor
the plan, President Johnson and
the Democrats may be forced to
respond in some way.

Gen. Hershey feel that he is a

Even American liberals are
base. Kingman Brewster Jr.,
president oi Yale University, in
dissenting with Hershey’s letter
d November 4 in which he told
draft boards "to induct students
immediately if they try to ob-
struct the draft." Brewster said,
“1 think that it destroys the
notion oi military service being
a privilege and an obligation and
not a punishment.” lwonder what
some Negro boy would say about
his privilege to fight for someone
class-"freedom" while he doesn't
have his own. Personally, I feel
there is no obligation on earth
that should require a man to kill
his fellow man.

Whether murder is legalized
or not 1 will not participate in
U.S. imperialist aggression in
Vietnam or anywhere U.s. troops
will go next to put down a peo-
ple's revolution.

The government and peeple of
the United States have lost the
revolutionary fever that made
this country the haven for the
oppressed and the greatest nation
on earth. Their only interestls in
getting materially rich, and they
don't care what country they rape
or how morally prostituted they
become as long as they have
those two cars in the garage
and membership in the best coun-
try club.

We who are in the protest
movement carry the true tradi-
tion of Americanism as estab-
lished by Sam Asams and the
Sons of Liberty. Henry David
Thoreau when he refused to pay
his income tax to support the
Mexican War, the abolitionists,
the farmer-labor protest of the
late 19th century and the present
day civil rights movement.

A new more humanistic philo— ’

sophy or party has to evolve
in America to achieve the goals
upon which this country was
founded. Our uni-party system
has to change and fast. It had to
be concerned with the rights of
all its citizens and all the citizens
of the world. Nationalism is an
outmoded concept. What is good
for the U.S. is not always good
for the rest of the world.

The Jazz Review

by Lou Strong

 

 

Since November, 1963, there
have been more tributes and me-
morials to John F. Kennedy than
there are critics to review them.
About four months ago, an addi-
tion to the list was made by
Oliver Nelson who wrote a ser-
ies of pieces dedicated and en-
titled, "A Tribute to John F.
Kennedy." The pieces them-
selves were inspired by some of
the speeches of the late presi-
dent, and thus, he was able to
capture the essence of Kennedy’s
words in his music.

In more ways than one, this
piece is a truly personal thing
to Oliver. For the day the presi-
dent was assaslnated, he and the
majority of the musicians used
on this recording date were re-
hearsing another album. They
were as shocked and hurt as the
rest oi the world. When he had
the time, Oliver worked on this
tribute and finally, Verve releas-
ed the final product. The final
product is more than a tribute to
John Kennedy, however. It is a
tribute to jazz, to America and
to Oliver Nelson himself.

it’s a tribute to Mr. Kennedy
because of the very fact that it
is dedicated to him. But what
makes it really a tribute is that
it is one of the few artistic works
that is in any way able to ap-
proach the genius of the lost
president.

We a tribute to jazz because
Oliver is known as one of the
best composers and arrangers
in jazz as well as a more than
good saxophonist. What's more,
the piece itself is based on the
jazz idiom (whatever that is, but
we’ll talk more about that at a
later date) and the musicians he
used on the date are the best in
the business. Phil Woods, Jer-
ome Richards and many more.

It's a tribute to America be-
cause only America could pro-
duce a man of Kennedy's inter-
national stature and then turn
around and produce the creative
genius of Oliver Nelson to pay
tribute to Kennedy in this man-

ner.

It's a tribute to Oliver him-
self because this is the first
time the world has experienced
the full extent of his enormous
talent. This album is Oliver Neh
son at his best. lie has reached
the pinacle of his profession but
i feel that he will continue to go

up.
The Tribute to John F, Ken
hedy is more dish a tribute. It

is a iestin. ’ I: arid
that declan . A
man can no “ I'Lled

from existence by an assasin's
bullet. His memory will live on
through the work of those who
live after him and in him.

After reading my column from
last week, I started wondering
whether 1 was really competent
enough to review a Blues per-
formance. For that matter, just
what is blues and how does it
relate to jazz?

I can't really answer the ques-
tion concerning my own com-
petence. That's a question for
my readers to answer. All!
can do is convey my own opinions
on what is good and-or bad about
a particular performance. There
are times when I win not convey
my opinions, however. When I
am too personally involved with
a particular group of perform-
ers, or if 1 don't know as much
about a particular area of per-
formance as 1 think a good re-
viewer should, then I will keep
my comments to myself.

As far as Blues is concerned,
my knowledge of it extends tothe
influence of certain Blues styles
on the jazz idiom. In this light,
and considering my overallback-
ground in music, my degree of
competence will speak for itself.

The definition of Blues has
been tossed around since the so-
called birth of the Blues. Some
say it dates back to the old days
of slavery. Others say that it
really started with the evolution
of old Dixieland and the migra-
tion of Dixieland to the North
(Chicago, for example). The bas-
ic musical definition is,atwelve-
bar melody divided into four
bars of "A," four bars "13,"
and four bars "A" again. But
this definition is so basic and
general that to depend on it alone
as the basis of discussion would
lend to more fallacies than we
can handle. 50, 1 would refer you
to the many excellent books on
the subject that have been put on
the market by men who have
specialized in the Blues.

The relation of Blues jazz
is like the relation of breathing
to singing. Over 75 per cent of
the jazz pieces 0n the market
today make use of the Blues form
in one way or another. With the
present avant-garde movement
however, musicians have been
trying to get away from the Blues
form. As to the results of their
efforts,. . . well, [leave that to
your own critical car.

So, we have the basis of the
idea. Blues is an essential part
of jazz and as such, it is a valid
area of criticism for me as a
jazz critic.

 

A Source of *. Stud
in University

by Carl Lindernan

The growth of a University
is reflected, as one of many
actors, in the increasing and
clunging source of students ao-
miited. Academic factors and
sociological factors affect the na-
ture of the curriculum, the stu-
dent aciiviiiea offered and the
acuity composition.

The recently published "its
port to Gulchnce Personnel" of
October 196'] of the State Uni-
versity at Albany examines some
ofthechanges occurringasare-
suit of our increasing studeu

Compiled by the Office ofA.d-
missions, is total of 10,101 appl'.’
cations were received for the
1988-67 year — a 27.6 per cent
increase from 1965-66. Of those
received, 2,953 Freshmen, 2,-
832 Transfer students and 454
Interlutioml and non-deuce stu-
dents were accepted. ln totality
the percentage of Freshman ac-
cepted increased 37.8 per cent
from 1985436, of transfer stu-
dents 10.5 per cent and of inter-
national and non-degree students
11.5 per cent.

One obvious indication oithese
statistics is the increasing de-
mand for entrance into the Uni-
versity. But of greater signifi-
cance is geographic and
social contest they are coming
from.

This same question is asked
in the memorandum sent out by
the Chancellor of the State Uni-
versity of New York concerning
future growth of the entire Uni-
versity system. Exactly whatare
the hetereogenous characteris-
tics of the student population and
those which are the homogeneous
aspects of the studentpopulation.
Following, what is the impact of
these clnracteristics of the stu-
dent population on the curricu-
lum, especially in terms of their
pro-college preparation, their
origins geographic and-or eco-
nomic, and their social origins.

With the exclusion oiour flmn-
cial aids program in the last few
years the University has opened
the possibilities of a college
education to those formerly ex-
cluded due to financial limita-
tions.

The University now partici-
pates in National Defense Loan
Program, 1300 Program, Col-
lege Work - study Program,
NYSHEAC Loan Program and
the Federal Loan Program for
Cuban Students. in addition the
University provides oncampus
employment, scholarships and
emergency shortuterm loan pro-

ms.

The possibility of further ex-
pansion may allow an even broad-
er hetereogenous composition of

AConiemporary Tale:Lack of Interaction

by Fredda Jaiiee

i should like to preface this
contemporary fairy tale with a
rational explanation: my mainob-
ject is to direct attention to the
glaring lack of faculty-student
interaction. drawing upon both
personal experience and views
of the campus at large.

Try to conjure up a mental
picture of a typical student at a
State University. struggling
against a bourgeois background
and an even bleaker future, she
is determined, in the face of all
adversity, to rise above her sur-
roundings and scale the heights
of Olympus.

She would cringe to be classi-
fied under the species "atypi-
cal," secure as she is in her
delusion of herself as a blatant
individual. " Mediocrity just isn't
my bag," is one of her pet
“pearls of wisdom." While not
an active participator in campus
events, she will feign apathy.
considering herself actively in-
different. She refuses to be am-
bushed into agreeing that college
is great for finding a mate, pre-
ferring to View her education as
a vehicle which will carry her
into the realm of her lofty aspira-
tions, however obscure they may
seem at the moment.

And so our heroine, through a
logical sequence of events, finds
a desolate lack of inspiratim in
her intellectual pursuits. it was
initially surprising to note that
after a less - than - gruelling
semester of undergraduate
courses, she had actually dip

gressed. She was alarmed with
the amount of busy work pro
duced: papers hastily composed
to the tune of gloesing over the
relevant details. Her five intro-
ductory courses, totally unrelatp
ed and extremely disappointing,
forced her to turn toward other
areas in her quest. She con-
veniently scoffed at Dean’s List
as an illusim; an appeasement
for the pluggers and grinds.

Eureka! ln utter desperation:
she sought out her sagacious,
wizened professors, whose re-
servoirs of knowledge had been
painstakingly amassed.

Allow me to interpotate for the
sake of clarity: the schism be-
tween studente and faculty is a
reciprocal fault, aided and shei-
ted by our less-than-ivy-covered
establishment, under-hallowed
history, impractical regulations,
and even food service. At any
rate, our State student invited an
impressive mentor to join her in
partaking a delectable dinner.

The experience was exhilarat-
ing. This may have been accom-
plished by an overdose of san-
turnc, the flickering lights, or
puzzled contemporaries who eyed
her askance. But for a few pre-
cious moments, she was trans-
formed, conversing on an in-
tellectual level, encouraging an
exchange of suggestions and re-
flectlons.

At the risk of melodramatic
overtones, l hope that such valu-
able and exciting experience will
be geared towards a wider appli-
cation.
