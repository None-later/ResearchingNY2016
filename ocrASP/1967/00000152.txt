There are only two reasons: ignor-
ance or negligence on the part of every
person or group who saw this budget.
if the members of Finance Committee
or Central Council did not know that
Y.A.F. was a political group, they should
have asked. if they did know, they should
have reasoned that one particular group
should not get a budget if another of the

ceive the same. '

There was once a statement passed
by Finance Committee which did say that
no partisan group should receive Stu-
dent Association funds. Why didn't the
Committee know of this policy. Council
should be able to rely on its sub-groups
for some information. Even so, it shouldn't
have happened.

it's too bad this had to happen so the
opponents of the basic system can grasp

“Project Themis," a larger De-
partinnt of Defense program.

(Project 'i'hsmis was funded in
not for spprosimstely $27 
lion in approximately 42 univer-
sity research centers “to de-
velop more callers ofenellsnce
in engineeriil and other hard
sciences."

Although we wereunsbietodis-
cover if the above mentionedpro-
jest acitllly exists on this Uni-
versity campus, we did come
across a Navy grant given to
the Atmospheric Science Re-
search Center for "atmospher-
ic electrical chillies."

The research on this project
deals with cloud electricity and
weather conditions, and accord-
ing to one source does not have
anything to do directly with wes-
ponry or chemical-biological

w 9.
(Army FieldManml3-l0,“The
Employment ofChemical and Bio-
logical Agents," says: "The de-
cision to employ lethal or in-
capacitating . . . agents is a
matter of national policy. When
the decision is made, US . . .
commanders wlu receive through
command channels the authority
to use such agents and specific
guidance in their use.")

The study of weather condi-
tions can have peaceful as well
as military implications. For ex-
ample, ths use of defoliates and
herbicides in Vietmm depends
on knowledge of how weather
conditions will affect tilese wea-
pens.

Professors and students may
be appalled at the use of chem-
ical wsrihre in Vietnam without
ever considering that the re-
search made these weapons
possible was carried out on their
campuses. '

(Field Manual 3-10 lists three
riot control agents tint are now
being used in Vietnam: CS (irri-
tant gas), CN vomiting gas) and
DM nausea .

The students and faculty etc or-

neli University recently learned
that a special branch of the Uni-

uud although no classes
were bungiaight in these centers
and only a small number of Cor.
nell administrators were even
aware of the existence of these
projects. Does Project 'l‘hemls
exist on this campus? Or was
the New Left Notes' article mis.
taken?

(Two l-isrvsrd doctors offer-
ed this appraisal on the riot con-
trol agents being used in Viet-
mm: “The first three groups
to be discussed are incapacitat-
ing but ustnlly non-lethal, al-
though they can kill under cer-
tain circumstances: extremely
high concentration of agent or
highly susceptible victim, suchas
the very young the very old or
the very sick."5

According to the Annual Re-
port of the Faculty Saints and
Senate Councils of the Univer-
sity, the Council on Research
requested publication in the Fac-
ulty Handbook of a trustee reso-
lution "that University research
shall be unrestricted as to
the public dissemination of the
conduct, progress and results of
such research."

(There are gas masks in the
US for only i in 10,000 per-
sons. Accidents involving cBw
research at Army research cen-
ter Fort Detrick in Maryland
have already caused deaths. In
January, 1966 The New York
Times ram-ted that an Austral-

offensive action
chad of "asphyidation.")

Did the Faculty Senate debate
a specific project or merely the
issue of unclassified research?
Did they raise the question of
involvement in DOD programs
the purpose of which might not
be apparent in the details of
one specific grant? These are
questions that should be raised
not only in Faculty Senate and
in the science departments, but
by the entire university commun-
ity.

More CouncilRepresentation?

A guest editorial submitted
by Gary F. Schufte.

The main problem with Central
Council is stagnation; Central
Council should be a forum of
ideas.

Perhaps the best way to alle-
viate this problem would be to
increase the lit-large member-
ship on Council by, decreasing
the ratio of one representative
to every 400 students to, say,
one to 300 or less. This would
pump some much needed new
blood into Council.

New blood, or even more blood,
will not necessarily make Council
an effective body; but each new
member brings with him new
ideas—that is to say, his own
ideas.

Why underscore “new?” As it
now stands, too many of the
members of Council have come
up through the "Commissions
Game." This fact alone gives
Council two strikes against it-
self before it starts. in the first
place, a person elected to Coun-
cil from a commission is sore-
ly overworked.

’l‘o illustrath an ambitious per-
son might join the staff of the
Albany Student Press, for
exunple. Before he may hold
a seat on Communications Com-
mission, ho must first become a
member of Nawsboard, which
means he must first become
an editor or associate editor.
He may then be sent from News-
bosrd to Communications Com~
muisnion, and from there ioCoun-
c 0

Add to this basic load the pro-
bability that he will have to serve
on at least one committee on
the commission isvelsrsianothsr
on the Council level, and it be-
comes obvious why Council mem-

bars have little to contribute
in the way of fresh ideas.

The second problem with com-
mission representatives on Coun-
cil is that, on the whole, the
person's ideas have already been
bashed over and either presented
to Council or dismissed. From
the legislation brought before
Council so far this year, it is
apparent that the latter case
prevails.

That is not to say, however,
that commissions should not exist
or have representation on Coun-
cil. The reason for having
commissions, and Council com-
mittees, is so that most of the
work will be performed outside
of Council, thus leaving Council
free to devote its time to "more
important matters.”

The most important thing
Council will probably work on
this year is the room and board
recommendation. Even with this,
the main part of the recommen-
dation will be drawn up by com-
mittes and than be presented to
Council; thereby leaving Council,
in theory, free to work on other
policy statements concurrently.

As it now stands, Council
spends most of its time rubber
stamping financial policies soul
to it by finance committee. 1
would suggest that this is so
because no one presently on
Council has come up with any-
thing bettar to do.

The main argument against
increasing the size of Council
seems to be that Council Would
become too large to operate or-

fsctivaly. This is aiallacy. Coun-
cil hood only set restrictions
to limit debate; and considering
the course of much of the do-
bato so far till: year, that isn't

Off Center

by M.J . Rosenberg

One thing must first be made
clear. The university chapter of
the Young Americans for Free-
dom is not much of a threat
to any of us. it is a small,
rather poorly organiud campus
activity, and its- influence is nil.
State's YAF'ers are not, for the
most part, volatile right-wing
extremists. They are the kind
of people who clip our DAILY
NEWS editorials and drive a
car with “Support Your Local
Police" stickers on the bumper

go to war rallies because
they believe that is the way to
help the American Veitnamese
effort. They don't groan when
they hear "Letter to My Teen-
age Son" on the radio but rather
nod their head in solemn agree
ment with a glazed look in their
eyes. Because they really believe
those things about creeping
socialism, and Communist con-
spiracies, nil-American activi-
ties and that J. Edgar Hoover
and his FBI is our last bastion
against international Com-
munism. They honestly think that
they are patriots.

So they are not really a threat
to non-extremists on the campus.
They attract mainly those of
right-wing persuasion anyway.
But they do also attract the
apolitical and the politically
naive. For YAF has wrapped it-
self up In the American Flag and
it is honestly hard to see where
the stripes begin and YAF ends.
Any YAF’er will tell you that
they stand for everything that the
United States does (except per-
haps our last five Presidents).
So it is quite simple to see how
some fellow from Pitkins, New
York, upset at peace demonstra-
tions and Robert Kennedy, can
decide to join YAF which is
after all, “for our boys.” Bu
there is more to YAF than that.

The Young Americans for
Freedom is an extreme right-
wing organization. One of its
prime principles is that "the
United States should stress vlt'r
tory over rather than coexis-
tence with (international Com-
munism).” Firstly most Ameri-
cans have come to the conclu-
sion that there just is no such

al Is international Com—
munism; that Communism is
not a monolithic force. But more
variant is the fact that these
self-proclaimed patriots are talk.-
nuolear' war in sratlicr

urht vein. They talk about “vic-
lOI'v" but what they mean is
nuclear war. The Atom bomb
does not frighten the stout-heart-
ed man of the YAF and it never

 

has. They led a nationwide drive
against President Kennedy's nu-
clear annihiliatlon as in "the
interests of the United

best
States."

in early 1965, YAF along with
the John Birch Society initiated
a letter-writing campaign that
eventually so intimidated the
Firestone Company that they
abandoned plans to build a plant
in Rumanis. liars again we see
the ignorance that is YAF. They
have not yetdiscoverod that there
is a big difference between Ru-
mania and Albania; perhaps the
National Review has not yet no-
ticed the Sino-Soviet schism. So
they sabotage a plan that could
not only bring Rumanla closer
to the United States and bring
the fruits of YAF blessed Amer-
ican capitalism to the "enslaved
Europe."
That's the Young Americans for

people of Eastern

Freedom.

One of the household deities

of the YAF‘ is Senator Strom
Thurmond of South Carolina; the
gentle advocate of "freedom and
just law" for everyone but No-
groes and the poor. Thurmond is
a racist and although one hesi-
tates to paint YAF with that
brush the fact is that along with
Reagan, Goldwater and Tower,
the Young Americans for Free-
dom have cheered Strom Thur-
mond many times. in the lo
run YAF has achieved little.i
suppose we can just laugh at
them. But i don't think that we
are yet secure enough to lau
at any organization that says that
it "supports our 61's” and yet
shrilly advocates a policy that
would have more and more of
them killed. Nor can we is

at a well-financed organization
with a program that if ever
adopted by those in power would
lend to a nuclear holocaust.

The Young American for
Freedom is built on a fou ation
of fear and invective. SUNYA
students are aware enough not
to become involved with the YAF
but the issue today is not whether
YAF has the right to exist on
this campus, it does, but rather
should it be allotted money by
Central Council. it should not.
Thousands of students did not
pay student fees to support a
political organization; we must
give aid to no political faction.
At the last meeting of SUNYA's
YAF chapter, the President made
the suggestion that the YAF' burn
a Viet Cong flag and stage
demonstration “just to lot the
school know we exist." Central
Council should not allot one dime

 
    

 

 

 
  
   

The determination and

today's most

is not
way the Johnson Administr

(and its predecessors) seeks to

justify it.

President Johnson claims that
one of our basicvrsssisls for
fighting in Vietnam is to save

the Vietnamese people from

op-
pression. He hirther states that
we would fight to save other

nations from dictatorial rule.
Why then did we establish the
authoritarian rule of Diem, and
more recently back the govern-
ment of General Ky, whose idol
was Adolf Hitler? if we are to be
consistent in our actions we
should free the Spanish from the
Facist Franco and the Hatisns
from their Faclst government.

Undoubtedly, U.S. foreign
policy has always had humanis-
tic overtones. Throughout the
aiears American presidents have

ought it necessary to rational-
ize their foreign policy by making
impassioned pleas for the free-
dom of the oppressed. in attempt-
ing to gain support for our actions
we have cloaked our goals in
fallacious garb.

in reality, U.S. Foreign Policy
is primarily resolved by circum-
stance and expediency. in the late
thirties and the early forties the

t0!!! .
of U.S. Foreign Policy is one of
cartroversisi

the policy itself, but the
stion

 

to an organization of such
shallowness; or of so little im-
port that only ten showed for
the meeting. We must strip the
American flag from the YAF'
and see it for what it is; a
pro-war, anti-progressive right
wing lobby. The hypocrisy that
is the YAF is aptly demonstrar
ted by the fact that the last
meeting was attended by young,
physically fit, short-haired, clean
and wholesome young Americans
who lust after an American vic~
tory in Vietnam. They see Viet-
nam as Armageddon. They call
for escalation Which means more
bombs and more men. And yet
they hold their 25 deferments.
THEY don't return their draft
cards. When our Young Amati»
cans for Freedom chapter
marches enmass to fight for that
cause they so strongly believe in,
than we can see them as some-
thing mors thanabunch of crypto-
patriots. But not until then. . .

regular Thursday night meetings

that this constitution leaves u lot

that it needs work.

A complete rewriting at this

Review 0i The New Righl Wing

 

 

by Ray Bertrand

Because of the existence of
many channels of communication,
today's Americans take the
chance of acquiring faulty in-
formation. ln order toseek truth,
we must ask. 1 would iiketoknow
just what ademocraiic society is.

is a democratic society one in
which college students play the
role of part-time political experts
and attempt to impose on a na-
tion actions prompted by their
political beliefs, beliefs which
come about after intense analyse.-
tion of Allen Ginsburg's poems?
Or is a democratic society one
in which a majority of people
elect representatives more com-
petent than themselves, and both
majority and minority, previous-
ly agreeing, accept the decisions
of these representatives as laws
for the good of the whole? is a
democratic sooiety one in which
people who disagree with the
majority drop out of the society
in order to tune in to another,
so they can fink-out of reality by
turning-on with drugs? Or is a
democratic society one in which
people who disagree campaign in
an orderly manner to get their
views heard?

is a democratic society one
which would rather smoke its
lawns than mow them? lsademo-
cratlc society one which follows
the biblical traditions of peace
and love, but overlooks thestate-
ment that they will earn their
bread by the sweat oftheir brow?
in it one where members not as
parasites to the harder working
members of the society, rather
than earning this bread? Does
this new democratic society for-
get that in all other societies.

marriage is an institution? Or
does this democratic society pro-
pose the institutionalization of
free love, and the rewarding of a
bonus to mothers of illegitimate
children in the form of a greater
income tax deduction?

Can a democratic society actu-
ally believe thst a nation doesn’t
need defense? When it encour-
ages draft card burning, does it
think that if every male particin
pated in this action that the Unit-
ed Siates could survive for long?
Does a democratic society need
an artificial stimulus to see
reality? Can it not look at the
world and examine what it sees?
is a tree any more of a tree, just
because a person is on a trip?

Does a demOcratic society ad-
vocate terror to accomplish its
goals? Does it feel that fire is
actually the wsytoerase bigotry?
Can it think that looting and mur-
der will win it admiration? Can
it be so brainwashed to think that
noble, but unrealistic conceptsof
peace and love can afford it pro-
tection from aggressive, belli-
gerent nations?

idealism is not the answer.
Love will never stop a bullet.
Riotlng will never gain respect
for anyone. These advocates of
a democratic society are fortun-
ate that ihey live in the United
states. For i fear that in Russia
or China today, tulips and poppy
seeds would not afford them with
an adequate shield. Brave new
worlds of dissent do not exist
unless they are allowed to. ideal-
ism never triumphs over
realism. When it has been de-
feated, idealism is lost until it
may be found once more, by mis-
fits in a democratic society.
