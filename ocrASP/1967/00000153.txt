COMMDNICATIONS

 

 

Oly'eds Obﬁciors
To the Editor:

1 am submitting the follwing
communication in reference to
the letter headed, "Obi-cu 'Oh-
jaetor' ”. i would like to have
this letter be recein with the
and

res. .
in their letter which appeared
on Dace, mber 1, Miss Kendlg and

‘ Miss lssac stated that, “The

people who are fighting for the
Good are in Vietnam. The GOOD
1N OUR COUNTRY." I wonder
if it is possible to answer the
question, "Who is fighting for

2" so easily. 'Let us

for a moment. Let us be will-
ing to attempt to establish who
is truly fighting for the Good.
Only those who are

affirm that HUMAN BEINGS ARE
MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY-
THING ELSE can claim to be
fighting for the Good. And let
us remember lhatboth the Ameri-
can soidier who is disabled for
life or perhaps killed and the
Viet Congwhom he is tryingto
kill are faunas beings. Only those
who are willing to see the folly
of divorcing policies from mor-
ality—a failing common to both
some hawks and some doves—
can haveavalid claim tothe
Good. Only those whose basic
concern is the welfare of the hu-
man beings involved ln the Viet-
namese war can claimtobefight-
ing for the Good. And let us re-
member that the human beings in-
clude American soldiers, South
Vietnamese and North Vieh
narnese. Only those who are in-
terested in relieving the suffer-
ing caused by the present war
can claim to be fighting for the
Good. Only those who are willing
to maintain these attitudes can
claim to be fighting for the Good.
Only by maintaining these atti-
tudes will we be able to serve
our country in truth, for it is
only these attitudes that can give
her goals worthy of attaining.

Walter John Clark
(Jilly Replies
To the Editor:

1 wish at this time to reply to
Fred Penul's letter that was
printed in the ASP of November
17. i do this simply because si-
lence would be construed as an
acceptance of Mr. Pensel's
charges as factual.

Penul feels that television
cannot produce art. Obviously he
knows little of its history. But a
few years ago the names of Chay-
efsky, Rose and Sterling dom-
inated television drama, and their
teleplays and the TV writings of
others have been acclaimed as
masterful treatments of pertinent
American themes.

1 really could care less wheth-
er or not Penml approves of the
subjects 1 write about. if he wish-
es to read TV Guide this is his
own personal decision to make.

Further, to refute another of
Penzel's accusations, the fact
that l dislike most of the new
(and old, incidentally) shows
presently on the air (as my writ-
ings indicate) is ample proof
that the majority of my time is
not wasted in watching anyone's
"boob-tube.”

l have never yet reviewed a
Broadway play the new theatre
season. My second column dis-
cussed, rather, the opening of
this season, and I used the gener-

commonls of all three New
York City newspaper drama cri-
ties to discuss the shortcomings
and merits of the first Broadway
and off-Broadway productions of
the year.

True, 1 emphasized Clive
Barnes comments more than
those of the other two reviewsrs
but simply because Mr. Barnes is
the superior critic. If Penzel
really wishes to publicly accuse
me of plagiarism let me remind
him that he would have to pro-
duce solid evidence to support
this libelous smear.

Lastly, I never discussed the

motion picture “Camelot.” in-
stead,‘ prompted by the N.Y.C.
opening of that pichire, 1 dis.
cussed the reasons for the failure

" of the play “Camelot” and slim
ply stated my hot” thatthe mo-
tion picture would not be burden
ed down with the Broadway ver-
sion's mistakes. ,

And, since Fennel felt loftyend
elowent enough to cell the en-
tire arts section of the paper a
failure, 1 will add that if Penal.
doesn't like this section of the
paper no one is begging him to
read it.

The arts columnists oi the
ASP are an quitegratefulthatthe
editors have given us the rela-
tive freedom to write what we
want to, on whatever subjects
are of immediate interest to us.

Pennel’s letter was a disgust.-
ing slap at these two persons,
Sara ltlttsley and Linda Berdan
(the latter chiefly responsible
for the arts pages, and doing a
commendable job, too).

i feel that Psnsel's attack was
as trivial and worthless as he
claims this year’s arts section
to be. We of the ASP knowwe are
not a "Great Metropolitan News-
paper." Does Fennel still think
he's in high school, or does he
realize that this paper is distri-
buted to a collegiate audience?

Considering the paucityof Pen-
zel's accusations, it would be
only fair to insist that before
he tells the arts columnists of
the ASP how to write he should
first learn how to read.

HOKBOKI

by Neil Linden

Before I begin, some words
of explanation would be in order:
Aalborg, Aalst, aardvard, aard-
wolf. That should do, if we ever-
look the fact that nothing at all
was said before 1 began. They
were in order nonetheless. You
may be curious as to where this
all began, and with good reason.
Then 1 shall explain. Whilel sat
in the snack bar reading the ASP
last Friday it all hit me. Several
slabs of plaster and a very perk
ceptive observation, from the
ceiling and my mind respective-
ly. 1 shall concern ourselves
only with the latter for the mean-
time. it was there in black and
white. Sixteen pages of articles,
letters, ads and pictures done
by everybody (but my brother)
and his brother. This 1 found
hard to believe, but having con-
tributed nothing to the paper, i
managed. (i might mention at
this point that you must have
better things to do).

Getting back, i then asked my-
self: "Myself," i asked, "what
is a student publication without
something by me?" Thenllooked
once again at the ASP. lihen
repeated the question to myself
(a bit louder) only to find myself
looking down at the ASP. 1 very
politely said to the newsprint
sitting in front of me: “You
realize of course that you are
begging the question." This
rather clever rejoinder quickly
renewed my self-confidence, as 1
shoved the entire incident into
the entrails of my mind. Now,
what have we learned from this?
Probably that i should have dis-
cussed the plnster, not to men-
tion the ceiling (too late -— 1 al--
ready did). All this brings to
mind a favorite anecdote of the
late President Fillmore. 1 hard-
ly have time to mention it here,
however.

Many people have asked me
"What is HOKBOKl anyway?"
Many people have written to me
and asked, “Just what is
HOKBOKI anyhow?” To these
people and also to those who may
not care, i will say only this: it
is a translation of an old trans-
literated Arabic idiomatic ex‘
pression, the translation ofwhich
loses too much of the original
meaning to make it worth going

into at length. But say it back-
wards enough to a friend, and
he might get you a glass of
water. But let me stop here.
