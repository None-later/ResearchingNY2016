Elmer Rice's play, "The Adding Ma-
chine,” is the second State University
Theatre production of the 1967-68 sea-
son. The 1923 expressionist drama is
being staged by Martin Mann of the Dept.

of Speech and Dramatic Art for an 8:30.

p.m., Wednesdill’. December 13 Opening.
The play is being co-produced jointly
by the S.U.T. and by the Hawley Tele-

vision Studio, where the

experiment

in mixed media will be presented. Direc-
tor Mann stated that the three television
monitors to be mounted in the "theatre"

will be used to visualize

the internal

thoughts of the lead character, Mr. Zero.

Mann suggested that Zero is "the uni-
versal slave type," dominated more by
the laws of society than by the command-
ments of Fate. In this example of ex-
pressionism, the curious combination of
tragedy and comedy is meant to show the
helpless alienation of Zero and his
farcically pathetical condition in life.

Scott Regan as Zero meets Ed Kramer at Studio in the

history. the inability of pe'opleeto com-
municate, the social demands of individual
conformity, and the indifference of God
to humanity’s troubled existence in the
Universe) were felt by Mann to be perti-
nent to modern audiences.

The staging of "The Adding Machine"
will be as revolutionary as the play's
theme appears to be commonplace. in
addition to employing television, Mann
has broken with theatrical conventions

'by a bold, modernistic expansion of the

traditional staging area.

Scott Regan will play the part of the
doomed Zero, and Karen Prete has been
cast in all three female leads. Explain-
ing this triple-casting, Mann stated that
Miss Prete will enact the roles of all
those women with whom Zero has some
sort of love relationship.

Mrs. Zero is the marriage-object, the
nagging wife. Daisy. Diana Dorethea De-
vore is the pure or ideal love object,
for whom Zero is never able to express
his feelings (just as Zero would never
dare tell his wife of his contempt for
her). The sex-dream object is Judy O’-
Grady. whom Zero can only think about.

Willian Snyder is also cast in several
roles. He will portray the boss, a police-
man, the trial judge, and Charles, all
persons who act as authority figures
in positions of dominance over Zero.
Edward Kramer will be seen as Shrdlu,
whom Zero meets in the Elysian Fields.

The other cast members include G.
Maggie, G. Carr, [-1. Kerner, F. Penzel,
A. Bennett, T. Brennan, D. Saucke, N.
Miller, W. McNair, B. Richards, G. Sla-
vin. A. Murray and M. Bono. Freda
Scott is handling the chores of the stage
manager. Barbara Weinstein is assistant
director.

Sets have been designed by Robert
Donnolly; with Jerome R. Hanley's light-
ing, the over-all technical aspect of the
production will further emphasize Mann’s
uncommon staging. Arleen DuMond de-
signed the costumes and masks. Theodore
L. Glazer is credited with the eye-catch-
ing programs and posters.

Films

I ‘ALBANY- Stunts class I.

 

 

 

 

 

Although this week promises
to be a good one for area films
(see below), last one was un-
usually thin. 50 those seeking
the usual infuriating commentary
are warned: no big review this
column, just idle (and possibly
more infuriating) chat.

In retrospect. a healthily crea-
tivs cinema year: There was the
usual quantity of rubbish, both
elegant ("A Man and a Woman,"
"You're a Big Boy Now," "Night
Games," "Ulysses") and grubby
("The Dirty Dozen," "Quiller
Memorandum," "Oh Dad, Poor
Dad," "You Only Live Twice").

More interesting was the sur-
prising amount of respectable
and original work: "Accident,"
"Bonnie and Clyde," "Loving
Couples,” "Dutchman," "War
Game," "Cool Hand Luke,"
"Crazy Quilt," even (a real sur-
prise) Doaen's “Two for the
Road” — all films cinematical-
iy inventive, personally envision-
ed, and, unlike the movies men-
tioned earlier, at bottom inter-
ested in the delectable varieties
of human nature. Finally, though
I luvs not seen "Au Hasard Bal-
thasar" and the latest Godards,
I think that this year i have
seen four films that are undoubt-
able masterpieces.

Reshais’ "La Guerre Est Fin-
le" is one. In this picture his
classical style, formerly spent
exploring static situations, coal-
esces with a story of sufficient
nuance and substance to create
his warmest and most affecting
film. Bergman's "Persona"
moves him even further into that
terrain mapped out by Drayei‘
40 years ago; "Persona" is an
agnostlc's "Passion of Joan of
Arc." Bergman has stripped cin-
ema down to a rigorous austerity
where every frame is necessary;
he is as architectonically bril-
liant as his beloved Bach. And
like Bach he must be approach-
ed by his own rules.

in "Blow-Up” Antonionl enters
Godard's murderous world of Pop
Culture and creates a film reson-
ailnil with rhythms the screen
has never before presented.
Though I thought the flows pro-
Kreslively more offensive at ev-
ery viewing, the vision remain-
ed. No film has told us more
Oboil't modern life than “Blow-
U .

“Falstaff” is the most good-
humored and exhllil'ating film
Welles has made—a theatrical
Picture only in that it is play-
ed on a larger-than-life scale.
it will endure with "Throne of
3100i!" as the clnema's most
Omative renderings of Shakes-

peare, and the ones peanuts would
call least "faithful."

One notable disappointment
was Truffaut's "Fahrenheit
451.” Full ofcinematic brilliance
and that relaxed warmth remin-
iscent of Renoir, the movie fails
to satisfy, perhaps because of
the Hollywood gloss and the weak
story line. (Truffaut is current-
ly filming a thriller, "The Bride
Wore Black," which makes me
wish he would return to the emo-
tional source of"The400810ws"
and "Jules and Jim." Of the two
sides we saw of him in "Shoot
the Piano Player" — human
warmth and stylistic trickiness
— l’m afraid the latter is going
to win out.)

Some unsolicited remarks:
Looking over what I love written
so far for the ASP and resec-
ing some of the films 1 have
discussed have led me to two
corrections — First, 1 now
believe I overrated "The Fam-
ily Way," in that I allowed its
genuine concern and respect for
human values to outweigh its
tendency to mawkishness and
some serious difficulties in
plausibility.

More importantly, I now think
that upon my first seeing of
"The War Game," the merits
of the film were so striking
that l slighted its major fault
— a repetitive, interpolated
preachlness. Upon another view-
ing, this fault is more obtensive,
but the film’s overall impact is
not lessened, i still think it one
of the most skillful, imaginative,
and moving films of recent years.

Enough nonsense. This week at
the movies: Coincidentally, Pet-
er Watkins' two most controver-
sial films are currently playing
in the Albany area. His recent
"Privilege," an all-out attack
on Church and Establishment,
is at the Cinema Art Theatre on
River Street in Troy. Watkins'
"War Game" is presently show-
ing at the Cinema Delaware with
Stanley Kubrick's "Dr. Strange-
love" -- an unfortunate com-
bination, i think, which results
in a sort of audience overkill.
But Strangelove's nose-thumb-
ing has not lost its gusto, and
for the academic community,
“The War Game" is required
viewing.

By the way, following these
at the Delaware is Joseph Los.
ey's "Accident," which contains
the best duoperformance l have
seen this year: Dirk Bogarde
and Stanley Baker as Oxford dons
enmeshed in the subtle pressure
of Academe. More on this
remarkable picture next week.

Amusing! Provocati'vehwiat adjective can de-
scribe music such as that performed in the Music
Department's Twentieth Century concert last
Thursihy‘l Can one really find any sort of univer-
sal or proper adjective? 1 think not. Such art
truly defies description, and absolutely defies criti-
cism, and i do not mean this in any derogatory
sense whatsoever . . . For many many years,
music and art love fallen into the realm of uter-
ature when being described or criticized. This
cannot be done with the contemporary, because as
yet i believe tlnt the majority of music listeners
have been unable to find any terms (literary
that is) for expressing their emotions or reac-
tions, and consequently their criticism.

it is a form of the art for which, at least at
present, we must sit back, listen, and let what-
ever reaction that may come come, and not try
to analyze it. The secret to gaining an under-
standing or appreciation certainly is not found
by walking out as so many did!

i was really tickled to see the reactions of
a few elderly or middle-aged men and women
who attended. As i sat down before curtain, i
saw that they had obviously dolled out to come
to State University for a fine faculty concert.
At that time i wondered what they were going
to think, because they did not know what they
were in for. Well, they sat resolutely for a
while, they twitched etc., but their piece of cake
came after intermission when lguess the "Sound
Synthesizer" got to be too much for them, and
they left.

To open the concert, the faculty chose a piece
entitled "For Franz Kline" by Morton Feldman.
Written in 1962, it calls for French horn, piano,
chimes, soprano voice, violin and cello. William
Hudson conducted, and to fill the instrumental
spots were Joel Chadabe on the chimes; Laurence
Farrell, piano; Daniel Nimetz, French horn; violin
Marvin Morgenstern and cello, John Goberman
(two members of the American String Trio);
and Marjory Fuller, soprano voice.

The most outstanding feature of this was, of
course, the voice part which was so admirably
performed by Miss Fuller. Without any help from
the instrumentalists, she had to enter on dis-
sonant notes, singing odd interval! etc., all ter-
ribly difficult and requiring terrific sense of tone.
it was truly an accomplishment.

Right now there are on display
Art County purchases from
over the past four years. the ulb-
play is on the third floor cor-
ridor of the Fine Arts Building;
and even though it's a little out
of the way and the main gallery
tends to overshadow it, the dis-
play is worth looking into.

Most of the works are prints,
and this term "prints" does
not mean a reproduction of some
work of art. These are all ori-
ginal works which the artist de-
signs and the prints just as a
newspaper does its editions,
though of course in a much more
limited way. After the works are
printed, they are numbered (the
lower the number, are more val-
uable) and usually signed.

The American String Trio, our artists in real-
dence, then came on to perform “string Trio,
Opus 20" by Anton von Webern. it was enjoyable
and interesting to watch their concentration in

_ producing the sounds and syncopation required
by this number. They had to play, pluck the
strings, and tap their bows, sometimes in such

r rapid succession tint lcould seldom follow them.

Following the intermission, the film "House"
was to be shown, but because of technical diffi-
culties they were forced to postpone that. instead,
a tape, "The Sound Synthesizer" was played. A
second tape, "Events," by Mel Powell was run
which featured electronic sounds and three voices
“SIM Hart Crane's "Legend" as a text.

For a very appropriate closing, Ctudabe's own
creation "Street Scene" was played, using as a
background, slides by William Clark from the
Art department, and Patricia Grignet on the
English horn. The tape by CImhbe incorporated
electronic sounds as well as insertions of jazz or
other hmiliar noises that we hear each day.
He also used a highly familiar voice reading a
text by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, "The Longstreet."
It was very interesting, and considerable credit
should go to Chsdsbe who has put his talentsto
use both in this and with the drama department.

Was the concert good or bad? 1 cannot really
say. it was an experience, and teams away feel-
ing very glad that i had participated. ( i believe
"participated" is a good word.) One thing which
highly pleased me was to see the members of
the music department as busy as bees all work-
ing together and incorporating student perform-
ers. it certainly is a healthy sign. Such concerts
as the one given that night are certainly signs
that we as a University are more than "up and
coming.”

is another one which is an 11-

On the whole, the exhibit adds
something to a trip to see what's
being shown in the main gallery.

in addition to Art Council's
prints, there are some works
by students who have been work~
ing under certain faculty mem-
bers. if you know the different
styles of the Art faculty, it's
perfectly evident which student
studied with which faculty mem-
ber; but the art is excellently
done and the works deserve rec-
ognition. The use of color (or
in one case, the non-use ofcolor)
is particularly good.
