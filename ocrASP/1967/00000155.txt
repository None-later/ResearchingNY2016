Textiles Termed Exciting;
Center’s Needed Touch

by Gail Salton

A burst of exciting color has
come to the Campus Center
Gallery, spilling over joyfully
into the entire lobby, and even
wrapping itself about Minerva.
it is the work of Mrs. Symy-
oung Yook Minn, a freelance
textile designer from Troy.
. Mrs. Minn, who has been call-
ed "a dainty Jackson Pollock,"
uses emotional expressionism to
convey her impressionistic de-
signs to cloth. On a canvas of
velveteen or corduroy, she hand-
paints her designs, washing the
fabrics afterward to produce a
subtle blend of colors. Three
of the pieces were done by a silk
screen process. The wall - hang-
ing, which she wove herself, is
a very interesting piece, with
much twisting and turning of
threads to produce unusual pat-
terns.

Mrs. Minn came to this coun-
try from Korea in 1981, after
graduating with honors from the
College of Fine Arts of Seoul
National University. in New
York City she studied at the
Fashion institute of Technology
and new designs textiles for a
New York dress manufacturer.

Mrs. Minn uses the bright col-
ors and oriental motifs of Korea
often in her designs. One piece
of material, which is draped art-
fully over the balcony, bears
an abstraction of a Korean lion's
head motif. Her colors are warm
and vibrating, her forms free
and flowing, in the use of the
plush - looking velveteen and

‘Damn it! ’

At 8:16 p.m.,Saturday, Decem-
ber 8, 1967, the Freshman Dra-
ma Council will present in Page
Hall "DAMN' 1T1," this year's
freshman skit, sponsored by the
Class of 1971.

Director Jay Horshkowitz and
music - composer, lyrics- writer
Steve Hirsch have billed “DAMN’
lTx" as "an original variety
musical fantasy," with book writ-
ten by the entire cast.

The cast of “DAMN' 1T1” con-
sists of Marsha Burek, Mary
Carney, Rae Crsraiall, William
Doscher, Joanne Earl, llershko-
witz, Arnold Post and Marshall
Winkler.

Doscher is the assistantdirec-
tor. Phillip King, who designed
sets, will be stage manager. Su-

the thick corduroy, a feeling of
depth and luxuriousness is add-
ed to the sometimes forceful,
sometimes delicate designs.
Mrs. Minn has expressed her-
self in fabric much as Kline did
in his bold black strokes on
canvas.,

The fabrics work well within
Stone’s spaces and lines, and it
will certainly be a bleak winter
on campus when these color spots

 

dial post-marten was officially
released. l’d like at this time to
review this disaster, “TheApple
Tree," since a closing is asgood
a time to review a play as is

an opening. ,

"no Apple Tree" was a mu-
sical by Jerry Back and Sheldon
liar-nick, with music by the form-
er while the latter provided the
lyrics. Bock and liar-nick lave
previously written “Fiat-euo"
(which won a Pulitzer Prize),
“Tenderloin” (a failure), “She
Loves Me” (another flop). and
"Fiddler on the Roof” (their
only smash hit success).

This musical was in three
sets. The first, “The Diary of
Alum and Eve" (time: Satur-
day, June 1st; place: Eden), was
based on the noveibyMark Twain.
Act two was a musicaladaptation
of Frank R. Stockton's short
story, "The Lady or the Tiger?"
and not three a musical version
of Jules Feiffer's "Passionella."

Stuart Ostrow, whom iatechose
to be the unlucky producer who
would present this unlikely trium-
virate to Broadway audiences,
cast Alan Aida, Barbara Harris,
and Larry Blyden in the three
main roles (each similar)ofeach
of the three one-act musicals.
Each act tended to vary in over-
au quality.

Certain general comments,
however, can be made about all,
three acts (each an entirely dif-
ferent musical related to the two
others only through the repeated
theme of love).

Alda was on the whole pretty
awful: his Adam was totally dull;
his portrayal oftheprincess' lov-
er in ‘Lcdy or Tiger' was barely
noticeable; as Flip in "Passion-
ella” he was awkwardly, ama-
teuristh grotesque.

Barbara Harris won the Tony
(Broadway's Oscar) as "best

 

Fourth

 

Time/i round

by Igor Karoluk

 

As promised "Country Joe
and the Fish" have released
their second album "i Feel Like
i'm Fixln' to Die" (Vanguard)
this time complete witha "Fish"
game and directions for playing.
Fortunately, for me (see my
column on their first album)
they are as non-commercial, ir-
religious and beautiful as ever.

There is no big change in style; '

they are still playing what i
call "Jade East" music; asort
of conglomeratlon of soulful blues
and hard rock, heavily impreg-
nated with oriental sounds which
gives many of their instrumental
tracks a wavy, trickling, bam-
boo rainforest feeling. Now, if
you can get anything out of that,
congratulations — if you can’t,
watch a Jade East commercial
(or better yet, listen to one.)

The number which will hit you
right away is "i Feel Like i’m
Fixin' to Die - Rag," beginning
with the “fish cheer." in the tra-
dition of "Superbird"this proves
to be an outrageously hilarious
satirical song on Vietnam done
in a ricky-tick jug band style
complete with calliope. They Joy-
ously proclaim to parents: "Be
the first one on your block -
To have your boy come home in
a box." “Who am.l," mean-
while, ,is a pleading search for
identity. in "Rock Coast Blues“
Joe McDonald proves convinc-
ineg that he can sing blues with
the best. "Magoo" begins with
what sounds like a crash of
thunder followed by rain, but as
it continues you become fright-
eningly aware that bombs are
dropping, giving an ironic twist
to what would be an ordinary
love ballad. "Janis," the single
off the album, is quite a pleas-
ant song which ldoubt will ever
hit the top ten.

if you listen closely you will
find the unlabeled “Acid Com-
mercial" and “Bomb Sons" on
the second side. As far as l'm
conceer the best track on the

record, even if they are tre-
mendous lyricists, is the in-
strumental "Eastern Jam,”
slightly reminiscent of Paul
Butterfield's "East-West.”

if you get a chance, I suggest
you visit the library soon. They
have a room on the second floor
called the listening room with
all these beautiful turntables,
they even give you earphones
to listen. Suggestion —- bring
your own records (stereo) and
turn the volume all the way up
(gradually). What an exhilerating
feeling to have the music actual-
ly within your head.

"Blood, Sweat and Tears"
played the scene in NYC over

reports are really good for Al

Sheiustlydeserved it. HerEve '

was quite moving, a genuinely
affecting portrait of the typical
female.

As the princess in the second
act, Miss Harris was robust and
forceful, the passiomte, lustful,
royal heroine of literary fame.
As "Passionalls" she was lit-
erally boatliful, graceml and
stately in her role and blessed
with an unbelievably adroit sense
of comic timing.

Larry Blyden played the Snake
in ‘Diary' (in ark nixedo), a
sarcastic ballsdeei' in ‘Lady or
Tiger,’ and the narrator of "Pas-
sionelln." it was simply refresh-
ing to see him steal scene after
scene as he leisurely pranced,
strolled, and paced about on the

The first act was unbearably
long and too seriously concerned
with developing the theme tint
love between men and women
has always been too subtle to
be completely underst in all
it simple yet complex ramifica-
tions.

Yet there were several very
funny moments in “The Diary of
Adam and Eve." When Eye is
naming all the animals in Eden,
she describes Adam as stupid,
lazy and apathetic and then sud-
denly cries out, "Of course,
he’s a meal”

After Adam and Eve lave
"married" she continually at-
tempts to force him to work to
improve the appearance of their
home. Starting the conversation,
Eve says, “Adam, 1 think the
grass around our house should
be different from the rest of the
grass." Athm asks. “Different
—how?" Eve replies, "Shorter."

However, much of the better
material in the firstact may have
been taken straight out of Twain's
vindictiver wry novel. in the
second act, little that was said
was really interesting at all.
“The Lady or the Tiger" was

nothing less than a meniscu-
lar epic interlude, staged with
modest success by directorMike
Nichols.

Nichols, however, came alive
most definitelyinthewildly imag-
inative third act, Jules Feifer’s
unrestrained satireontheAmeri-

“Passionells.”

Cinderella, who wants to be a
movie star, is granted this oppor.

hood fairy godmother." She
stands upright on the stage, the
legenlhry American sex goddess
of the screen, complete with tight,
flowing, white sequin dress, lus-
trous platinum wig, and large,
quivering breasts.

This final act was. real Broad-
way: the score was bigand brassy
in the finest of stage musical
traditions, the dialogue was hon-
estly entertaining, and the tech-
nical effects were thrilling and
exciting, complete with a sev-
eral minute filmed sequence of
Miss Harris, a briuiant pop art
ending to a $300,000 fiasco.

Judging from Saturday’s Quadrangular tournament,
the wrestling outlook may be somewhat better than we
originally expected. The grapplers showed considerable
promise as they fell jus‘t short of capturing their second
consecutive Quadrangular title. The fact that 6 out of
10 Albany wrestlers reached the finals was certainly
encouraging, however, only one emerged as a champion.
So it looks like the Great Danes still have some work to
do in developing and polishing their skills, which makes
the nature of their schedule doubly unfortunate.

The first three matches are all against top notch schools
so the Great Danes will have to develop rapidly. Erik
Watts certainly looks like he will be ready. He was Al-
bany’s only champion. and he made it look easy as he
scored with a pin in his first encounter, and then took
the championship with a 15-2 decision.

Craig Springer and Frank Berry were both edged out
in the finals by one point. Springer lost 3-2 on a take
down that looked like it was out of bounds, while Berry
lost by a 2-1 count on a stalling call. Both of these
wrestlers should have winning records this year, but
they will have to come up with wins in the close ones
for the team to enjoy a fairly successful season.

Two others who should do well are Co-captain Roger
Gotham, and 130 pounder Gary Smagalski. Gorham ran
into a real monster in the finals, but he probably won't
be seeing too many others that he can’t handle. Sma-
gaiskl registered a pin in his first match, but was out-
pointed 4-0 in the final. A pleasant surprise was provided
at 191 where Roger Saul made his wrestling debuta
successful one. as be registered a pin in his first match.

Bill Clark was the only other Great Dane to register
an actual win, as he scored a last second take-down
to gain a one point victory in the consolations of 137
pound category. This gives Albany a fairly solid wrest-

ler in seven of the weights, but 145, 167 and heavy-
weight look weak. Against top schools three weak weights
is three too many, since one can hardly expect all of the
better wrestlers to win against the better schools. Fran
Weal who injured his elbow in practice may not be ready
for Oneonta, but he is expected to fill the 145 pound gap.
Saul will probably be moved into the heavyweight spot,
and if he continues to develop at his present rate, that

problem may also be solved.

F rosh Fall to MVCC;
Shooting Lapse Fatal

by Joel Valinski

The freshmen five started the
season on a sour note when they
lost at Utica to Mohawk Valley
Commluiity College. Albany went
into the game as underdogs, but
in the course of the game showed
they could outplay Mohawk. The
loss came as a big disappoint.
ment to Coach O'Brien and even
more of one to the players.

The hard training the fresh
have been through paid off, es-
pecially since their full court
press was used the entire game.
Only seven men were used and
none appeared dead at the finish.

Generally, Albany outplayed
Mohawk, but the shots just
weren't falling while the foul
shooting was even worse.

The game was close all the

way. Mohawk took an early five
point lead and the fresh chased
them from no further than this
the rest of the half. The press
worked well in this half, but in
spite of having the ball more
often than Mohawk, their cold
shooting kept them slightly be-
hind. The score at the half was
04-33.

Albany eventually took the lead
midway through the second half
and was leading by four points
with only six minute: left. How-
ever, a combination of more
cold shooting. poor officiatingand
a murderous fast break by Mo-
hawk broke the frosh. The final
score was 74-06, Mohawk.

Scoring: Jordan-23, Hicks-7,
Grilli - 15, Zarembarl, Smith-8,
Hebert-5, Newmark-‘7.

Danes Strengthened by
Addition of Transfers

Doc Sauers has done it again!
No transfers made their var-
sity basketball debut this week-
end and judging by their perfor-
mances, it looks like Sauers has
plucked a pair of fine prospects
from the Junior College ranks
to compliment his already excel-
lent core of ballplayers.

Wood came to Albany via
Albany Junior College, where he
averaged 22 points a game. Wood
started at guard both Friday
and Saturday. He impressed with
both his bail handling and his
shooting and he also played a
tight delensive WHO throughout.

Jim Caverly, a six footer who
captained Brooms Tech last year,

was the other transfer who saw
considerable action. Caverly was
Sauers' first sub up front. He
rebounded extremely well, and
also played rugged defame. And
although he did not shoot much he
did show considerable scoringpo-
tential.

Two other transfers who didn't
see action, but may make valu-
able contributions before the
season is over are Ed Arsenau,
and Dave ltiegel. Arseneau is a
5-10 guard who came by way of
Mohawk Valley Community,

while illegal is a 6-4 center who
started his college career at
Brockport.
