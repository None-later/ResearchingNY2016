Cardinal McCleskey Gymnasiumoffici'ally seats 1,600 ,

people. Friday night's crowd'easily'e‘iteeeded this amount.
Saturday eveningfs turnout also occupied all seats. Good
basketball attracts good crowds, and good crowds often
stimulate good hometeam basketball. Neither partner in
this relationship went home complaining after the "tour-
ney” was - over. The point is that Friday's fans came
back Saturday, obviously satisfied with what they saw, and
what they saw was good basketball, and furthermore, it
often takes these fans to kindle the spark which produces

good basketball.

The players were there. Williams College, indeed a
name school and a new one to Albany basketball, brought
in a big, fast team. Leading the attack was Jay Healy,
no'fless than an ECAC All East selection last year. Wil-
liams also brought with them Bill Untereker, a 6’6"
senior who poured through 28 points against the Great
Danes. Art Delusky of RPI, Chuck Huber ofCoast Guard,
and Albany’s Scott Price, all played well, and Albany's
Rich Margison, "outstanding tourney player,” outclass-
ed them all. The point is that name schools with star

caliber players were here.

Two coaches need be cited to prove that this was
good basketball. Dick Sauers of Albany and A1 Shaw of
Williams. Both have to their credit winning percentages

above the .650 marker.

Officials were there. You knew because they made
their presence felt, and because sometimes they didn't.
However these officials were supposedto be good, one
in fact often works in Madison Square Garden.

One comment by a newspaperman is this. Bob Mac-
Namara of the Knick News predicts that Albany will
be a power in this sport. in fact, he feels some day the
UCLANS will meet the SUNYANS, but then again, what

do sportswriters know.

ALBAY'NEW YORIl
“Food For India”
2,500 Students

VolunteerForFast

by Barb Grosunon

Tony students at the Univer-
sity will participate inthesecond
“Food for India" fast. Thedrive,
to secure money for food and ag-
ricultural help for the starving
people oflndia, was organized and
is sponsored by Sigma Tau Beta,
with the approval and support of
Central Council. Co-clnirmen
are Bill Cleveland andAndy Zam-

The parﬂoipating students,
about 084 from Alumld Quad,
459 from State Quad, 774 from
Colonial Qlﬂd, and 844 from
Dutch Quad will give up their
evening meal. in return, the Food
Service will domte the money
provided for this meal (about
'75 seam" person) in the form
of a c to UNlCEF's special
fund for the people of India.

With over 2,000 students who
have signed to participate, more
than $1,900 couldbe dented. This
is an increase of about $600 over
the amount collected last May in
the first task for India when
1751 students agreed to give up
their dinner.

At tint time, the University
responded to the need of millions
of Indian children and adults,
who were on the brink of starva-
tion due to a widespread drought,
by contributing $1,313.75. The
University was one of about 50
universities and colleges who
contributed to UNICEF's Applied
Nutrition Program then.

The money was used to pur-
cfnse 10,000 lbs. of CSM pow-
der (a corn-soy-mllk protein mix-
ture) —- enough for daily milk
serving for 4,000 children for an
entire month — and garden tool
kits for 60 school nutrition pro-
Jects. The results of today's fast
will be used for similarproJects.

Last Spring's drive was so suc-
cessful that C. Lloyd Bailey, Ex-
ecutive Director of UNICEF was
prompted to write the University
a letter of thanks. However, be-
cause of the sacrifice of many
University students, today's fast
for lndia is expected to be an
even greater success.

Adams To Present

Dr. Harold W. Adams, assoc-
iate professor of public admin-
istration in the Graduate School
of Public Affairs at State Uni-
versity of New York at Albany,

of Solstice later this month.

sity faculty in 1906. holds de-

Pilgrimage For Peace To Be
Organized Late This Month

The Interfaith Pilgrimage for
Vietmm Relief ce-sponsored by
Clergy and Layman Concerned
about Vietnam, theCathollc,Jew-
lab, and Episcopal Peace Fellow-
ships, andaQuakerAction Group,
seeks to bring home totheAmer-
ican people the “invisible suffer-
ing and obscured humanity of the
Vietnamese people.”

The organizers of the move-
ment aspire “to liberate men and
women of religious faith and good-
will from their oppressing com-
plicity in the endless bloodshed
of Vietnam by encouraging them
to transcend the barricades of
hostility with gifts of reconcil-
lation and relief for the count-
less innocents victimized by the
war.”

From December 23-29 the
movement will cross the nation
and attempt to "overcome the
walls of war which even now deny
the Fatherhood of God and the
brotherhood of man." “Such is
the challenge " according to the
Interfaith Pilgrimage organic
ere," posed by the U.S. Trading
with the Enemy Act and its ap-
pended rogulations which pres-
ently rule thoselivlng in the Com-
munist-controlled areas of Viet-
nam out of bounds to human com-
passion and humanitarian relief.’

It is hoped by the "Pilgrims"
that the participants will first
undertake to confront the problem
and inspire some concern in their
home communities on December
23 by undertaking a public walk
to their local post offices to mail
equivalent parcels of medical aid
to the Red Cross organizations of
North Vietnam, South Vietnam
and the National Liberation
Front.

Then on December 27, individ-
uals and groups are encouraged
to being their Journeys to the
Peace Bridge at Buffalo, New
York, which spans the Canadian-
American border.

At 10 a.m. on Friday, De-
cember 20, a worship service,
briefing session and press con-
ference will be held at a large
church (to be announced) in Buf-

falo and at approximately 2 p.m.
those assembled will move out for
the Peace Bridge, and, depend-
ing on the disposition of the
American and Canadian authori-
ti' 5, ultimately Join with sympa-
thetic Canadians in a final pub-
lic meeting in Toronto.

Several prominent American
clergyman are expected to lead
the procession across the Peace
Bridge. The organisers of the
Pilgrimage have stated that
"regardless of how many are
moved to share in this Pilgrim-
age, it is vital that all who do,
appreciate the distinction be-
tween Holy Obedience and hes-
tile defiance, that our witness
might call forth the best in all
men and humanity over enmity
prevail."
