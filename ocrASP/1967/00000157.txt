Wurzburg Program

Offers Students
Study In Germany

by Elizabeth Anderson

Thirv students from the State
University at Albany and State
University College at Oneonta
are now studying for one year
at the Unlvsrstty of Wurzburg
under the auspices of the Wurz-
burg Program. They left this
summer after intensive prepar-
ation in the German lsnguageand
culture. They will attend classes
along with German graduate stu-
dents and take a normal course
load of 12 hours.

The classes are held inamuch
more formal atmosphere than
most American universities. Due
partly to the students being older
(German students enter the uni-
versity at a later age) and the
mutual respect is reflected in
the grave attitude shared by the
students andprofessor. Theclass
is conducted in a more organ-
ized and systematic fashion.

The present students are liv-
ing in dorms orinprivate homes.
Next year, all the students will
live in the dorm. The rooms are
designed for double occupancy.

The estimated cost of the whole
program is between $2100 and
$2500. This includes transpor-
tation by the airlines, the pre-
paratory course, tuition for the
State University, room and board.
Scholarships and loans assist-
ence is available.

The student entering the pro-
gram should have a 3 average
in two years of German or the
equivalent. lie should supply his
academic record, and have a
personal interview. Theprogram
is restricted to those students
interested in the German lan-
guage and history.

According to Mr. John Winkei-
man, the program's adviser, the
program has a practical immed-
iate and obvious benefit for those
wanting to teach Gormanandinti-
mate feeling of German life and
understanding the role of Ger-
many in the world today.

Anyone interested in applying
should contact Winiielman in 110,
209 as soon as possible to fact-
litale planning of the program.

Sha iro Sees Failure?

by Jill chnik

Sta/I Reporter
“Fifty years after the Russian
Revolution there is still no free-
dom of the press and no free

elections.” The "failure to
achieve good government" is evi-
dent.

A good government, Mr. Leon-
ard Schapiro explained, "is one
which the people can feel is their
own, schievedby annalparttcipa-
tion and which takes into account
these Who are governed."

The elements of histice arrifair
play in addition to the ability
to protest were also cited as
characteristics of good govern-

ment.

Russia, said Shapiro, has had
a tradition of people with noble
ideas with little practicality,
therefore certain aspects of the
society are not attributable to

one person.

The traditional element of auto-
cracy, he said, is also imbedded
in the Russian past. “The period
from 1906 till the war was the
only time that it was possible
to speak of anything having to do
with the nature of a represen:
tative government. "more was
a lack of sincere desire to make
a donneratic constitution work."

Prefacing the “Lenin Phase,"
Shapiro said, “if a government
decides to govern alone it must
do so with a certain amount of
force; the Bolsheviks made that
decision.”

Lenin's attitudes, it was ex-
plained, ,were summarized by
his handling of the Socialists
at that time. He could not of-
ficially eliminate them, how-
ever he told his subordinates
that he would not mind if the
Socialists were eliminated un-
officially day “cooked-upcharges
and illegal arrests”). 1

Freedom of discussion and
even dissent was the rule but
only within the party. it was
the right of the Communists to
critisine and d .

“At the Tenth Party Congress
discussion was surpressed; the

monolithic ty came into eids-
tence. These s were intended
as temporary measures.

“it was felt that the party
was in great danger due to the
effectiveness of the criticism
coming from the Menshiviks and
from inside the party. if you
tolerate effective criticism you
put yourself in a position of
allowing those who critisizs
to share in the ruling. This le-
nin was determined not to do."

“Stalin made thepresentsituar
tion in which the government he-
comes a system of manipulated
organs whereas before they were
real centers of discussion."

ther of Stalin's marks was
his collectiviastion which She-

a
S

piro considered an agonizing and in

‘horrible process of virtual war
against one's own people."
it was said that Stalin's ec-
onomic reforms could not be
distinguished, from their politir
.osl “mu because chm re-
forms had the effect of binding
the party heathen-tier wrsins

ussian Revolution

it.

These purges were for the pur-
pose of eliminating
ber of people whom Stalin con-
sidered as real or potential ene-
mies.

“If you pursue a policy of
violence of that kind you must
pursue it to the end because
if you do not, you invite resis-
Since},

When Stalin died Khrushchev be-
came Premier and hebrought out
subjects whichhad not been taught
before. This wasbecause of pres-
sure from within the country and
because oi his own conscience.

"That in a system of that
kind is courageous and honest."
With this openness Khrushchev
created a new spirit of hope.
lie started but did not finish and
no one can see the end."

lie brought into the open Stai-
in's use of police force. In addi-
tion, Khrushchev's party re-
forms had repurcussions that re-
duced some in status.

Whereas Stalin had put the
party in the background by using,
in addition, the police along with
other instruments, Khrushchev
“reasserted the primacy of the
party," subordinatlng other in-
struments of the state to it.

After Khrushchev, a new type of
government was established in
the form of a "two-man dictator-
ship." The party has no clearly
defined place while the techni-
cians are becoming steadily more
important.

"Regression in the supres-
sion of literary freedom in addi-
tion to freedom of discussion in
certain academic fields, (es-
pecially history), "has become
policy in Soviet Russia tethy."

Shapiro made a number of
forecasts for the future of So-
viet Russia. lie said that already
the “incidence of acts of illegal-
ity has been reduced, howover,
it is “doubtful that there will
be a return to the rule of law"
because there has been "no on-
trenchment of the supremacy of
law; there is nothing built into
the system against the arbitrary
taking of law.

"There have been increasing
signs of courageous protest be-
cause there is some chance that
you might get away with it."
This is very far from dissent
and freedom of expression. What
it will lead to one camel say.

“That there should bechange"

is reflected in the "genuine de-
sire of authorities to increase
participation in party govern-
ment; a desire to turn the party
meeting into a form of discus-
sion.
“There are signs of pluralism
and groups forming outside party
control. (A true totalitarianstate
controls every single groupwith-
the society, however, pres-
sure groups do not exist.)

“Orownlg interest of the fu-
ture is primarily for technical
efficiency, technical advance."

emic, year, which of the follow-
ing would you have chosen? 
a. Room and board. b. Room but

d. Neither room nor board.

a. 1274 59.5 b. 685 31.9

3. Are you in favor of the
present meal plan, whereby one
receives breakfast and dinner
each day of the week?

Yes 497 23.3 No 1565
73.0 other 79 3.7

4. Would you be in favor of
the addition of a third daily
meal under board contract (20
meals per week-no Sunday even-
ing meal). Yes 861 40.3 No 1158

5..Would you be willing to
pay a reasonable increase in
board in order to add the third
meal? Yes 526 61.1 No 304
35.3 other 31 3.6 Only those
that said yes to 4. could vote
for 5.

6. Would you be in favor of a
14 meal per week contractwhere-
by one could choose to eat any
14 meals per week (your choice
of breakfast, lunch or dinner any
day of the week for a total of
14 meals per week)?

Yes 1830 85.4 No 272 12.8

7. If you had had a choice of
the plans stated in questions 4.
and 6, for the present academic
year, which would you have
chosen? No. 4. 348 16.4 No.
6 1723 80.4 other 70 3.2

9. Would you be in favor of
having meal tickets valid in any
dining hall on campus?

Yes 2029 94.7 No 91 4.3
other 21 1.0

Two questions were inter-
related. Question number 5 only
referred to those who had
answered yes in question 4. Ques-
tion 7 asked the studenttochoose
between the two plans that were
offered.

The results between Colonial
and Dutch Quad were almost the
same but the results from State
and Alumni were somewhat dif-
ferent because of the Freshman
that reside there.

More Fresh participated inthe
poll than upperclassmen pro-
bably because the poll was ad-
ministered on the dimer liner
and a higher percentage of Upper-
classmen live off-campus than
Freshmen.

   

Anotherreascn is that upper.
clasemen' ‘ have taken so many
polls that they may now consider
them a part of everyday campus

~ life whereas the Freshmen have

not participated in as many and
considered them more seriously.

.The greatest difference was in
response to question 8. The reg,

, son for this was probably that

the Freshmen have to commute
between Campuses and they often
have to go home to eat and then
return for some meeting or sell-
vity whereas the upperclassmen
do not. ’

Urges Seniors '

To Seek Jobs Now

NEW YORK CITY —- College
Seniors who expect to go to work
after graduation in June are urged
to visit offices of the New York
State Employment Service during
the Christmas recess.

Alfred L. Green, Executive
Director of the New York State
Labor Department's Division of
Employment, pointed out that al-
though the employment prospects
of college graduates continue to
be good, the best kind of place-
ment requires that both Employ-
ment Service specialists and an
plicants will be given as much
time as possible to search for
and to consider Job opportuni-

as.

“The Christmas recess," said
Green, "is a good time for
seniors to come in and discuss
career opportunities. Employ-
ment Service specialists can then.
look for suitable openings and
arrange for interviews later, pos-
sibly during the Easter recess."

College seniors are especially
invited to visit the Offices. Such
Offices are located in New York,
White Plains, Rochester, Syra-
cuse, Buffalo and Albany.

Central Council defeated a bill
introduced by Margaret Dunlap,
which states that, “Student As-
sociation monies shall not be
used to finance any group which
advocates any specific partisan
political viewpoint or specific
religious viewpoint" by a razor-
thin 9-10-8 margin at the meet-
ing last Thursday night.

The main arguments present-
ed for the bill was that student
Association funds should not sup-
port a group that is a lobbying,
partisan group that presents to
persuade .others to their point
of view.

Opposing arguments stated that
'a great deal of these organiza-
tions are somewhat educational
e.g. Young Americans for Free-
dom (YAF) since they provide
speakers and that student As-
sociation should have a greater
breadth of programming. It was
also stated that Community Pro-
gramming Commission had pass-
ed a resolution which recogniz-
ed the necessity of funding po-
litical groups.

Most of the controversy was
centered on YAF; since the or-
ganization was allocated an ap-
propriation the previous week.
M.J. Rosenberg stated "YAF is
a national, conservative organ-
ization that lobbies and opposes
all progrésslve legislation and
that a group of this nature,wheth-
er of the right or the left, should
not receive funds."

He stated that no other school
gives money to these types of
groups and that Council would be
very unique if they give funds.
Paul Breslin, chairman of Fi-
nance Committee, stated that
of the $328 given to YAF, it
is all to be used in an educa-
tional nature except for the $10
for the National Charter Fee.

James Kahn, vice-chairman of
Finance, countered this state-
ment by saying that the money
for publicity could be used in
almost any way. Dick Long-
shore also disagreed on the "ad-
ucational" value of YAF.

The question was asked if oth-
er groups received money. Jeff
Mishkin, chairman of Central
Council, said no other political
groups get money. Judy Mills,
also a member of Finance, said
that the Committee has approv-
ed Young Democrats' budget but
they have not yet received any
funds.

    
 
  
 

   

by Vic Leeper

Ed Potskowskl. vice president
of YAF and Bob laemsn, its

treasurer, stated that there is a .

need for other speakers besides
those of Forum of Politics which
has not has aconservative speak-
er in two years.

Dunlap replied that Forum can
have any type of speaker they
want and the Y 1" members
should join Forum to insure that
it represents all points of view.
Another idea brought up was to
give more funds to Social and

Political Problems Board so
that they could sponsor more
speakers.

Doreen Frankel said that Coun-
cil should not evaluate YAF sep-
arately; it should consider the
broader question, whether any
political group should receive
funds. She stated that if Council
gives money to one group it must
give to others of this type.

Frankel said that this would
cause an expansion of budgets in
this area and a competition for
funds. Breslin stated that this
happens in all areas e.g. Ski
Club got a budget and now sail-
ing Club will want one.

Gary Schutte, from the floor,
said that student Association
should not be a political support-
ing organization and that it should
not give funds to apartlsan group
which would be contrary to some-
one's beliefs. Bill Cleveland said
that since Student Tax is volun-
tary a person would not have to
support what he deemed anofien-
sive group.

Mr. Neil Brown, director of
the Campus Center, stated that
it is highly desirable to have a
breadth of speakers and that
they should not only be permit-
ted but encouraged to speak.
The University needs a wide cov-
erage of programming. This posi-
tion has been supported by the
Trustees, and the facilities are
made available free of charge.

After considerable debate An-
dy Mathias moved the previous
question. A vote was then taken.
After counting a tie vote, Pres-
ident Mishkin announced that
he was against the bill. He did
not break a its because under
Council rules the President is
a full voting member.

A bill was presented to re-

.sclnd the YAF budget but this

since the major arguments of
funding political groups had al-

enherg stated that it would be
rather inconsistent to rescind

their budget in light of the pre-
vlous action. This bill failed by
a large margin since a 2-3 vote
is neededin order to rescind a
bill.

Council passed a resolution
which "supports the lawful rights
of all students to freedom of ex-
pression . . . to demonstrate,_

does not seek to restrain or
deny these same rights to
others . . . and states its oppo-
sition to the actions of those who
seek to physically interfere with
the orderly conduct of Univer-
alty business."

Council also padsed another
resolution which evpreues its
categorical rejection of Lt. Gen.
Lewis Hershey's statement that
recommends that students or oth-
er Selective Service registrants

garded his action as irrespons-
lble and incredibly unjust. Coun-
cil questioned the desirability of
retaining Hershey in his current
position. They urged that Pres-
ident Johnson suspend the Direc-
tor until an investigation of his
abilities makes clear the wis-
dom of permitting him to con-
tinue.

The question was raised as
to what effect this would have.
Mishkin answered that it is up
to the citizens in a democracy
to state their opinions and try
to change things they disagree
with. Rosenberg said nearly
everyone would be for this bill,
even Central Council. A letter
and the resolution will be mailed
to President Johnson to let him
know of Council's decision.

Council also made the follow-
ing appointments: Traffic Court,
Steve Adlow, Kathleen Blotniek,
Charles Burch, Marvin Cole,
Cheryl Heater, Steve Rubensteln
and berry Weinstein. Paul Bres-
lin was appointed to the Faculty-
Student Committee on Resi-
dances.
