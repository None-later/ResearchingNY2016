"Did you pay your student This ',
year’s student tax returns have made this
question one of concern to the leaders
of the Student Association.

Many students do not realize that only
69 per cent of the undergraduate body paid
student tax this semester. Hence, Stu-
dent Assoclation's revenues for the fall
semester approach only $69,000.00 of a
total projected budget of the Student As-
sociation of $150,000.00. At this point,
Student Association needs to raise $90,-
000.00 to fulfill its financial commit-
ment to the various organizations.

Many students also do not realize that
the entire $23.00 payed under student
assessments does not go to the Student
Tax area of the financing Student As-
sociation. $9.00 of the Student Tax is
distributed as an athletic fee design-
ed to support the collegiate athletic pro-
grams.

As a result of this misconception stu-
dents often ask whether or not they will
receive $23.00 worth of benefits each
semester, and later decide that they
don't feel benefits derived equal amount
invested.

For this reason the Student Tax Cum-
minee has been discussing the possi-
bilities of splitting the student assess-
men: so that students may pay either
the Student Association assessment, the
athletic assessment, or both.

According to Paul Downs, vice pres-
ident of the Student Association, and Chair-
man of the Student Tax Committee, Fi-
nance Committee will now have to re-
evaluate the budgets allocated in Spring
'67, and eliminate unnecessary expens-
es in appropriations.

Downes further stated that the present
figures from the Business office indicate
that only 69.59 per cent of students paid
tax this semester as compared with 91
per cent in Fall 1966.

“l amnot in favor of cutting  .’
On the other 'hand, if Stud‘entfyTax does ,

not provide the necessary income to sub- ‘

sidize the' organizations and activates. ,

the only alternative would hefto cut the _ .
budgets. For example, i would not like

to see organizations inhibited by their

lack of sufficient funds.
“If the trend of the Student Tax reve-

nues continues to decline, the Student
Association will suffer. Each stu-
dent can help broaden the activities on
this Campus by paying his Student. Tax.”

Each year the Student Association pro-
vided an assortment of events. Below
is a partial listing of the events. the
price with Student Tax and the charge
levied to non-Student Tax payers.

This .list of activities is not com-
plete, but it still indicates an idea of
how much students pay to enter into
an event. Furthermore, Student Tax pay-
ment of $14.00 to the Student Associa-
tion, also provides this newspaper.
The Word, Prlrner, Observation, and
Campus Viewpoint are free to stu-
dents who have paid their Student Tax.

A student does not have to pay to
listen to WSUA, which is financed by
the Student Association. Student Tax mon-
ey pays for Activities Day, Parent’s
Day, the All-University Reception, Cam-
pus Chest, Holiday Sing. Campus Car.-
nlval and State Fair which were spon-
sored. by Special Events Board with the
aid of Student Association monies.

All productions of the State University
Theatres and all concerts sponsored by
the Council for Contemporary Music are
financed by the Student Association.

It a student participates or holds office
in any activity or organization constituted
and financed by the Student Association
he must have paid his Student Tax.
