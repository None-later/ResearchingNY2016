War Crimes Tribunal

Cranvened

by David Soltrnan
Collegiate Press Service

nmltlLDE, Denmark (CPS)—
The Secald international War
Crimes Tribunal cmvened last
week in this small town outside

C .

The Tribunal — sometimes
called the “Russell Trbunal"
in hater of Bertrand meson,
its founder — sent its third
message to the United States
government asking for andficial
American representative. The
u.s. representative would have
the right to cross-examine wit-
nesses and present evidenceger-
mails to charges of American
“war crimes" in Vietnam, ac-
cording to Yugoslav jurist Wladi-
mir Dedljer, the chairman of the
noskilde session.

The Tribunal is concerned with
three questions this session:

1. Has the United States gov-
ernment and weapons forbidden
by the laws of war in Visham?

2. Have Vietnamese prisoners
been subjected to inhuman trest-
msnt, and have civilian popula-
tions been subjected to unjust
reprisels by Americans?

8. is the United States govern-
ment guilty of genocide, accord-
ing to the accepted juridical de-
finition’f

The Tribunal is composed of
seventeen jurists, scientists,
writers and philosophers from 12
colntries. Lord Russell, the

men of the Tribunal, though he
does not attend the sessions.
This is the second Tribunal

held in Scandinavia. The first,-

in May (1 this year, was held in
Stockholm. Another tribunal, in-
dependent oi the “Russell" trip
bunal, was held in Tokyo this
August.

Both of these earlier tribunals
found that the 0.8. had committed
war crimes in Vietnam, through
the use of fragmentation end
guava bombs, cannister bombs,
butterﬂy bombs, wind-blast
bombs, end dum-dum pellets. All
are banned by the Geneva Coo-
vention. The Tokyo tribunal also
decided that the U.S. in "eye-
tematically" slaughtering cl.
vilian populations by chemical
end gas warfare, including poi-
sonlrw food and water.

The as. was'invited to send
representatives to both meetings
but did not.

On the cpsaiiu day of the
Rosktlde session. Prof. Maurice
outvier, a French wespcnn ek-
pert, testified that the U.S. had
increased the use «fragmente-

May Tribunal inStockholm.Prof.
Oilivier has visited Vietnam ext
tensively during the period, in-
cluding a large part of North

Fragmentation end gueva
bombs contain hundreds of small
steel pellets which are spewed
out upon explosion. They are
easily- deflected when they enter
the human body.

“This means the wounds are
nearly impossible to treat surgi-
cally,” Prof. Ollivier said.

“Fragmentation and guava
bombs are being used only on
civilian populations," he testi-
fied. "They have absolutely no
effect on military targets."

"The U. S. government has
placed contracts for the produc-
tion of 40,784,000 tons of steel
pellets for use in Vietnam-bound
gusva bombs before May, 1968,
he testified.

"The American government is
also experimenting with thethird
generation oi fragmentation
bombs," he said. "They are now
replacing the steel pellets with
steel needles." No needle bombs
have been used yet in Vietnam,
he added. The plant to menu-
faeture them is located in San
Jose, California, he testified.

“Vietnam is being used as a
field of experimentation to im-
prove the efficlency of American
weapons," Prof. OUiver said.“
"Sixty-seven weapons used in
Vietnam have been visible im-
proved cnatriai-and-error basis.
An example is the use of laser
beams," he said.

The opening session also heard
from Arturo Trombadori, an
ltaltan Resistance hero during

World War it and the Vietnam,

correspondent for the ltalian
paper "L'Unita." He gave
graphic eyewitness accounts of
American bombing raids on iso-
lated villages in North Vietnam,
far from the cities or military
installations.

Religious Groups

Serve Students

Tryads chrinity lfoungAdults
serves the Methodist student a:
the University campus. This
group is affiliatedwiththeTrinity
Methodist Church in Albany.

The Fellowship of Episcmel
Students (rm) instituted in the
Spring of less, provides an op-
portunity for Epiecqlaliens
attending the University to perti-
oipate in worship as a religion
community.

‘ Presently FES is involved
in an intercity project worldng
with youth groups. Aprerequisite
for participation in this project
is a training program with an
intercity specialist. This train-
ing period centers around the
needs of the local youth and pre-
pares the students to lead dis-
logues discussiru such topics as
Black Power and community or-
ganizations with theyouth groups.

The majority of the activities
in which the Fellowship partici-
pstes are channeled through the
Church oi the University Com-
munity. Working ecumenicnlly
with the other religious organi-
zations on campus is strongly
advocated by the Fellowship of
Episcopal Students.

Activities appealing to a wide
range of interests are sponsored
by Tryads. Various discussion
groups which explore religions
are only one upset ofthe organi-
zation. on December 16 mem-
bers will go Christmas caroling,
and all interested parties are
invited to join in the holiday
festivities.

The largest percentage of stu-
dents comprising Tryads are
from the University. Students
from other schools in the area
and hem other religions sects
are encouraged to attend the
religious group.

Tryads was instituted six years
ago. The Unison between the
Church and the Methodist mem-
bers of the University community
is made by the advisers, Mr.snd
Mrs. David Cook, members ofthe
Trinity Methodist Church.

Lutheran Students
C reateC hurchSpirit

The Lutheran Student Associa-
tion at the University, a local
member of the Lutheran Student
Association of America offers
worship for its members within
the parish structure of the First
Lutheran Church in Albany. The
association, however, opens its
meetings to those of all religious
mutations.

The association is financed
through the New York Synod of
the Lutheran Church through its
youth programs in the First Lu-
tharan Church. Advised by Rev.
William thtbergar, the associan
tion works as a part oftheperish
rather than as a separate group.

Members participate insupper
meetings, discussions on modern
theological and moral problems

films. Social activities
strengthen the bond betwaen
members, and those involved in
the ecumenical spirit.

Formerly involved with other
Lutheran students in trl-clty
schools such as Albany Junior
College, Albany Pharmacy, and
others, the Lutheran Student
Association is now worklngwithin
the university community.

pressure for action mornts from

gradual, schools all over the
country. There are m" “h
dicstlona, though. that he me!
resolve the issue in a way
will discriminate heavily againli
students in the social science!
and humanities.

According to Gustave Arlt,
President oftheCouncil ofGradu-
ate Schools, (668). It I- likely
that the president will hold a
meeting of his advisers on the
draft sometime in the middle of
next week, and resolve some of
the basic questions ncttaksn care
of by the draft law.

For Arlt, as for the nearly
400 graduate school officials here
for annual meeting of C68, the
President has already created a
serious problem by putting off
his decision on the draft this
long. The council and other
groups have been urging swift
action since the 1967 draft law
was passed last June.

"There’s a feelingofconsider-
able gloom and pessimism here,”
said Arlt explaining that the gov-
ernment’s inaction made it diffi-
cult for graduate schools toknow
whether or not the male students
now applying would be drafted.

There are two basic questions
that the President must resolve
with regard to the draft: first, he
must decide how to select
draftses in such a way that they
won't all come from the same age
group. Second, he must decide
what academic fields are to be
designated as critical. Graduate
students in critical fields will be
assured of getting dreft.defer-
manta.

it is the second question that
has Arlt and other education of-
ficials worried most.ltiareport-
ed that the National Security
Council, which is charged under
the draft law with designating
certain fields as critical, has
recommended that all students in
the physical sciences (including
mathematics), the biological
sciences and engineering be
granted deferments. '

The White House has offered
no comment on any ofthe reports
about the draft that are circulat-
ing. if this chain true, however—
and education officials believe
widely it is -— then firatyearsnd
prospective grad students in the
social sciences and the humani-
ties will basr the brunt of this
summer's draft calls.

Education organisations have
uniformly opposed such a plan.
The Commission on Federal Rs-
laticna of the American Council
on Education (ACE) has proposed
that deferments "be provided
only in narrow and critically
needed specialties." Others, like

       
  
     

 
   

    
  

 

  
   

  
  
   
 

 

  
 
  
  
 

 

 

 

the new Association of sun

. Universities and Land GrentCol.

legal: (NASULG), have said a
student's academic field'ahould

- not determine whether or not he

is drafted.

Pressure in favor of the plan
has come from manpowar ex-
perts within the Commerce and
Labor Departments, who stress
the need for more scientists in
a society heavily dependent on
technology.

The President's decision on
how to select different age groups
for thedreft is also cfconcernto
educators. The President himself
originally favored random selec-
tion, end there is cmaiderebie
support for that system among
educators, but Congress has
made random selection impos-
nible.

According to the law, the presi-
dent must designate one agelevel
as the "prime age group," and
then make draft-eligible malesin
that group highest in the order
of cell.

The Defense Department, how-
ever, can call for a certain
"age-mix," saying that it wants
lf number of 19 years olds, x
number of 22 year olds, etc. The
President then will be obliged
to come up with a selection sys-
tem that supplies the "correct
mix."

One way of doing so has been
proposed by the ACE's Com-
mission on Federal Relations.
According to John Morse, the
head of the Commission, they
have recommended that all draft
eligible males be put into one
draft pool. Then, according to
Morse, the Commission recom-
mends that draftees be chosen on
the basis of the day and the
month they wore born — that is,
those born in January would go
before those born in February
regardless of the year of their
birth.

Morse believes that a plan
something like the one prqlosed
by his Commission will be put
into effect by the President. it
has disadvantages, though, for,
as Arlt says, "fellowswithbirth-
days in January, or February
will be taken for sure, whereas
some born in November won't
have to worry."

if there are some differences
of opinion among graduate school
officials about what the president
should do, they all agree on one
thing — the President must act
right away.

"if we don't get action by
Christmas, it'll be just toolate,"

Unfortunately, for those stu-
dents, however, the White House
has been keeping education of-
ficials as much in the dark as
everyone else.

Fraternities, Sororities

Plan For Greek Week

by Barbara Groesrnon

The second week in February
the sorcities and fraternities of
the University will join together
to present their annual Greek
Week. Preparations are being
made to make this one of the
most outstanding Greek functions
of the year.

Due to several problems, the
co-cheirman of Greek Week,
Linda Klein and George Lie-
bowitz, have been unable to set
up a definite schedule of events.

A tentative schedule of the main
activities includes the Smoker
and Coker on February 9. On
Saturday, February 10, the
Follies, a talent show featuring
members of various fraternities
and sororities, will be presented.
More people are still needed to
perform in this show.

On the isth and ltth there will
be open houses in the Greek
dorms and on the 19th a speaker
from outside the University will
speak. Phylis Diller, Agnes
Moorehead. sndAilt arsbeing
considered as sib espsskers.

On Friday ht, theldth, there
will be econcert.8eturdaywill be
Olympic Day, and onSeturday

night there will be abeer party
and possibly a Greek basketball
game with Sienna.

The Olympics this year will be
reduced to only three or four
events, but it is hoped that there
will be many participants and
supporters. The beer party will
not be held at Raphael's this
year, so the number of tickets
will have to be limited, and no
tickets will be sold at the door.

The greatest problem the co-
chalrmcn are having with Greek
Week is engaging entertainers
for the concert. The Faculty stu-
dent Association (FSA) has been
approached for funds, but FSA
has not held a meeting yet to
vote on the request.

Consequently, it is not known
how much can be used for the
concert. However, it is impacted
that the amount may be $8000;
this figure may be added to by
various beer companies.

The Greeks will also no sall-
ing buttons, distributing Greek
Week Books, and manningaGruek
table in the Campus Center. other
features of Greek Week will be
planned in the next few weeks and
will be annonnced soon.

Can World University
Achieve Understanding

by Fredda Jollcc

Generally, we place little value
in international responsibility.
Yet the characteristics of the
times, with its increasing tech-
nology and impending nuclear
warfare have led nullons into
international agreements. Our
world is a contracting one. The
responsibilities incurred inmost
of these agreements cannot be
fulfilled without similar internu-
tionnl loyalties.

The United Nations, though op-
parantly floundering, is the most
formidable attempt to date. The
Pan American Union, Schumann
Plan, and Common Market are
only a few of the many organiza»
tions which are attempting tocor-
rolate small nntlolml states into
on integrated whole. It has been
suggested that in this are of ex-
panding ideas, devnshltlng wea-
pons and shrinking hemispheres,
the only alternative to an inter-
national world government may
be a universal hocctcmb.

The idea of a World Univer-
sity would seem to be the acces-
sory or rather necessity of such
doctrines. in such an institution,
students would be taught the his-
tory and culture of the entire
world from a relatively unbiased
viewpoint. This college Would be
designed to develop a totally new
concept of the world and educa-
tion. it would 'wrvo as it feed-
back meclutnlsr in our will of

achieving world understandingaf
such an ideal is within our reach.)

The idea of nninternnticnalor-
gcniznticn of higher learning was
first proposed in 1019 in order
to "synthesize and correlate
branches of knowledge . . . the
best method for genorntlngakind
of central impulse for the intel-
lectual life of all Humanity."

There have been numerous pro-
posals submitted and many at-
tempts by projects and experi-
ments, but as yet they have been
unsuccessful in the materialize-
tion of a feasible, unified struc-
ture.

Recommendations have been
made by the League of Nations,
the United Nations, UNESCO, and
the Quakers (Friends World Col-
lege). However, there seem to
be too many conflicting factors
which must be resolved before
a World University could begin
to take shape. These include
language, location, financial sup-
port, salectlon of faculty and
students, organization, proced-
ure and curriculum. Obviously,
these are far from trivial, and
will require aninordinateamcunt
of interest, patience, planning
and creativity.

1 am not sure whether it is
realistically conceivable at the
moment to hope for a rational
solution of world conflict. These
problems are awesome and all-
enccmpassing. The Woml Uni-

versity might prove to be a base
of attack, stimulating ideas and
sentiments among the educated
everywhere, which might hope-
fully trickle down to "Every-
man." Through an inter-national
community of those pursuing
knowledge we might ultimately
penetrate the barriers of antagon-
ism which seem otherwise lm-
mutable.

Critics of the idea have point-
ed out that political disagree-
ments would create sharp disson-
sion and hamper the proper func-
tioning of the World University.
However, study at nnlntsrnatfon-
ul level might effectively disen-
tangle conflicting ideologies and
possibly bring about unification.

"The War Game” is an excel-
lent, stirring and downright re-
volting portrayal of the blight of
man in the consummation of his
self-destruction: the effects of
thermonuclear warfare. At one
point in the movie, a statement
by Pope Paul is inserted, bear-
im the comment that we must
learn to live with the bomb . . .
but perhaps mankind deservesnn
alternative to thisconjugal-bliss-
with-the-bomb and a World Uni-
versity mighl be the answer.

We have reached the heights
of sophistication in world eradi-
cation. . "'. why not allow our-
selves a fighting silence by using
world education as a means of
arresting our own destruction.

n ad
impersonal and lacking llllﬂ' co-
hesion will create enatmosphere

need for administrators to ex-

. pand their knowlam in under-

standing other departments retir-
er tlnn just their own department.

A workable knowledge of other
departments williead to an under-
standing of the department's
needs and, thereby, increase the

Quad To Install
Tlrizikcilng Techniques

or t

The diIectorys of State Quad-
rangle, Miss Susan Goldtn, Miss
Nancy Matthews, and Mr. Robert
Fairbanks, have recently under-
taken a mammoth task. The job
is far more difficult than com-
pleting the Flag Room, installing
screens, and furnishing the
lobbies. They are attempting to
"reconstruct" the minds of each
and 'every resident of StateQuad.

The directors feel thatbeneath
the mud, mire, and rubble ofccn-
structlon that now characterizes
the Quad, students who are de-
finitely questioning the entire col-

> lags experience live. Theobvlous

questions about when the dining
room will be ready and the U
Lounge opened are merely dis-
guises for the more serious ques-
tions about thinking, learning, and

The first evidence of the new
policy on the Quad were signs
throughout the dorms proclaim-
ing meetings with the general
purpose to think. in fact, the
theme of this movement is
"think" and the purpose is to
start each resident thinking about
his existence and reasons for
attending the University.

The program does not wish to
have the residents sit around
most of the evening and discuss
Vargll's Aeneid or the theories
of Thales, but would like to have
everyone be able to use his mind
creatively and put his knowledge
to practical use.

The directors realize thatstate
Quad cannot be a Ut0pia where
the students spend the evening
in quiet contemplation. Until the
system is changed so that marks
are not stressed as much asthey
are now, a residence hall of
"thinking human beings" is not
completely practical. The hall

should be oriented so that the
student can receive the most
from his education despite the
way his education may be run.

The directors feel that State
Quad may be the best place to
institute such a program for two
reasons. The first is that many
of the residents are freshmen
and therefore more likely to
receive this program thanupper-
classmen who have established
their goals and aims and the
methods they will employ to ob-
tain them.

State also has only six dorms
open and thus have only about 600
residents. A program oithis sort
must begin on a small and gradual
basis and-then spread out to
others.

These think sessions are known
as brainstorming. A small group
of peepls get together and for a
few minutes of concentrated
thinking put forth any ideas that
may come to their mind. These
ideas are not discussedbut more»
ly recorded by a member of the
group. The resultsrare then re-
viewed and examined.

A typical brainstorming ses-
slon may fail to yield the lofty
idea which the session tries to
evoke. However, if one good idea
is produced the entire session is
successful because a good idea
is often rare when everyone has
ceased thinking and merely
exists.

The directors of the Quad are
quite excited about this program.
The residents have already lived
on State for almost an entire
semester. They have lived with
the mud, the sand, the incon-
veniences of construction and
still managed to endure. The
“think” policy will just be
another challenge for them.
