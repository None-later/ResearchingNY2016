Christmas Present

Christmas is a contradiction this year'.
At a time when everyone is so preoccupied
with peace it seems ironic that the United
States is engaged in a war which is
incurring the wrath of the majority of the
people in the world, and threatening pos-
sible thermonuclear holocaust.

We have allowed ourselves to be drawn
into what is essentially a Civil War on
the side of a government which has con-
sistently shown its inability to represent
the populace since the withdrawal of the
French. The French had to suffer through
years of futile war and the loss ofits best
troops only to conclude that the forces
of nationalism and reform are stronger
than all of their bullets and bombs.

By historical forces greater than we
realized, we have allowed our country
to be lured into fighting a war against.
an alien ideology which was seen a few
years ago as the embodiment of all that
was evil. We do not have an historical
mission to expunge communism from the
world and remake it in our own image.

We have given up 'the execution of the
war entirely to the Pentagon Which has
fought the ‘war on the model of World
War II with the addition of a few heli-
copters. Experts on guerrilla war have
consistently maintained that s guerrilla
war can only be fought by giving the
people ths'reforms they desire, gaining
their confidence, fighting the guerrillas
with counter-guerrilla for -'

      

Let us state unequivoca y t - we 0,
not favor the allocation of Student As-
sociation monies for partisan politi-
cal groups on campus. and find the in-
decisive action of Central Council on
this matter appellim.

We do not feel that groups of a par-
tisan political nature should be financ-
ed by general student funds; especially
as such groups are subject to influence
and pressure from their outside affili-
ations. For this reason we think organ-
izations of this type should be self-
supporting.

More appalling is the fact that many
of the' Council members who voted to
defeat a bill which would have preclud-
ed S.A. from financing these groups, do
not really believe in the philosophy of
financing these groups.

The consideration that not enough con-
servative speakers are presently appear-
ing on campus was the argument which
swayed the votes of many of the Coun-
cil. members.

Confused Is'sues

 

 

Instead the Pentagon has poured in
more troops, bombed villages controlled
by the Viet Cong, disrupted the economy,
and prostituted the populace. Search-and-
destroy missions involving thousands of
troops have usually succeeded in captur-
ing only a few suspicious-looking civilians .
If this be our mission, we can only
hope that this country will immediately
re-examine its position in the world.

At one time, we were envied around
the world for our noble experiment in de-
mocracy and our unwillingness to involve
ourselves in the quarrels of other na-
tions. We do not advocate a return to
isolationism. just a return to our senses.
Our actions are despised in virtually
every country, even among our allies.

Our country is being torn by what has
been termed the greatest internal turmoil
since the Civil War. Our youth are being
sent to fight what they view asa senseless

,.war with senseless goals. The country

has lost its faith in its President and
its administration.

We strongly urge the Administration
to extricate itself from this quagmire
that is Vietnam by seriously negotiat-
ing with the Viet Cong and the North
Vietnamese government, through what-
ever means are necessary. We can only
regain our respect in the world by mak-
ing peace, not war. This indeed would be
a Christmas present for all of humanity.

It apparently did not occur to the
Council members to correct this dis-
crepancy by sending a directive to For-
um of Politics, (whose speakers have
been largely liberal) to present a fair
share of conservative speakers or the
Forum budget would be frozen.

Whether or not Council wishes to cor-
rect this mistake is still to be deter-
mined. We favor its immediate correc-
tion. Presently, there is talk of setting
up a non-partisan board which would as-
sure all partisan groups of equality in
speakers. Whether a functional. organ
will arise from this will also remain
to be seen; however, until this time we
favor immediate demands made to For-
um to include some conservative speak-
ers in its program.

it is a shame that Council, as in the
case of the Supreme Court. consistently
not only confuses issues. but refuses to
begin to correct mistakes immediately
in the existing organs of the government.

Many oftheargumeatsinsupr

ofthe cy onion-financial
mlvemeni’og the Student Asso-
ciatim with partisan groups are
sound. Traditionally, govern-
ments have always kept them-
selves separate from these or-
ganizations. Further, from the
standpoint of administrative ex-
pediency, life would be much

simpler. Central Cmncil has in-,

deed left itself open to requests
for many additional allocations.

Yet Central Council would not
adopt the policy. Was this merely
a horrendous mistake, contrary
to all reason? No. The position
taken by the Council cannot and
must not be labeled obnoxious,
illiterate, unfounded, or un-
tenable. The decision is con-
troversial -— fine — but it is not
indefensible. First of all, most
of the opposing arguments are
based on what mustbe considered
a' very imprecise analogy be-
tween the Student Association and
the Federal Government. The
Federal Govsrment levies taxes
on all its citizens, while the
Students Association is financed
by payment ofavoluntary assess-
ment. Another distinguishing fea-
ture of the Student Associationis
that it budgets and is therefore
publisher of this newspaper — a
clear indication that basic differ-
ences do exist between the gov-
ernment located in Washington
and the government locatedinthe
Campus Center.

The question, however, re-
mains. Why reject a policy of
financial separation from politic-
al and religious groups? To
answer we must define the pun-
pese of the Student Association.
The Student Association exists
primarily to provide for the stu-
dents ef this University a mean-
ingful life outside the classroom.
To accomplish this objective,
funds must be granted so that we
may maintain a broadprogramof
activities that are of a caliber
commensurate with the desires
and expectations of the Univer-
sity community.

Those who esporse the policy
of separation will contend here
that, yes, the Student Association
should provide a wide breadth of
activities and in fact is doing
that now. They will argue that we
need not give any money to any
partisan political viewpoint since
we already have a budgeted or-
ganisation that caters to all
political outlooks, namely,v the
Forum of Politics. 1 think it is
about time that we all stopped
talking about what should be and
objectively evaluate what is. The

:Mgﬂl, will always be partisan
. towards the beliefs of the leader-
ship, and is presently and signifi-
cantly, financed by Student tax
mortise. it might be argued that
membership in the Forum of
Politics is open to anyone and,
instead of giving money to any
one point of view, why not just
.encourage everybody to join the
Forum of Politics. This sug-
gestion is patently absurd. We
will not be able to elevate the
Forum of Politics to a non-
partisan levsl by injecting into it
a number of partisan groups. It
would still represent only the
position of the majority.

Be that as it may, argue those
who seek to keep Student Asso-
ciation funds out of partisan
coffers, partisan political groups
are now existing on campus with-
out Student Association monies
and are managing quite well to
propound their'p’oint of view.
The two most common examples
cited here are the Students for a
Democratic Society and the
Faculty-student Committee to end
the War in Vietnam. But againl
ask that we objectively evaluate
what is. Both these groups are
managing to exist, granted. Yet
I would seriously question the
quality of the program either has
been able to mount. The S.D.S.
table in the Campus Center has,
for all intent and purposes, re
verted into little more than a
private study area. And neither
of the two groups has been able
to bring to the campus a speaker
of high caliber who would aid
their cause and stir some much
needed dialogue. This void does
not stem from lack of committ-
ment, or initiative, or concern.
it stems simply from a lack of
resources.

So Central Council, motivated
by an all to apparent absence of
quality programming in certain
uses, rejected the policy of
financial separation. This rejec-
tion however, will certainly not
in itself completely solve the
problem and in fact, as noted
above, may well lead to several
administrative headaches. I
therefore would like to suggest
a course of action that may help
bring the two opposing views
closer together. lbelieve that ii’
an existing organ of the Student
Association, which is based on
the equal representation of sub-
ordinate groups, such as the
Political and Social Concerns
Board of the Community Pro-
gramming Commission, could be
granted a large fund for speakers
and programming, available to
all groups constituted under it, a
compromise solution may be ef-
fected. In this way the Student
Association could keep its funds
separate from partisan groups
except for purposes of program-
ming. Some groundwork will un-
doubtedly have to be done, butI
am reasonably sure that this plan
will be workable. i cannot stress
strongly enough theneed at this
:IIRE for compromise and good

Aftermreadlng .M..f. Boson-
berg’a column. Off Center, in
the December a issue of the
ASP it became obvious that one
of two things. was happening:
either Mr. Rosenberg was trying
to smearYAF through a deliber-
ate distortion of facts, or he is
totally ignorant of the principles
eapwsed by YAF. ln hopes of
enlightening Mr. Rosenberg and
allowing the' student body to read
the truth. the following is a copy
of the YAF Sharon Statement,
adopted. at Sharon, Connecticut,
September 9-11, 1960. “IN THIS
TIME of moral and political
crisis, it is the responsibility of
the youth of America to affirm
certain eternal truths. We as
young Conservaties believe:

THA'i‘foremost among the trans.
cendent values is theindividual's
use of his God-given free will,
whence derives his right to be
free from the restrictions of
arbitrary force;

THAT libery is lndivisable, and
that political freedom cannot long
exist without economic freedom;

THAT the purposes of govern-
ment are to protect these free-
doms through the preservation
of internal order, the provision
of national defense, and the ad-
ministration of justice;

THAT when government ventures
beyond these rightful functions,
it accumulates powsrwhich tends
to diminish order and liberty;

THAT the Constitution of the
United States is the best arrange-
ment yet devised for empowering
government to fulfill its preper
role, while restraining it from
the concentration and abuse of
power;

THAT the genius of the Con-
stitution — the divisionofpowors
—is summed up in the clause
which reserved primacy to the
several states, or to the people,
in those spheres not specifically
delegated to the Federal Gov-
ernment;

THAT the market economy, allo-
cating resources by the free play
of supply and demand, is the
single economic system compat-
ible with the requirements of
personal freedom and constitu-
tional government, and that it is
at the same time-the most pro
ductive supplier of human needs;

THAT when the government inter-
feres with the work ofthe market
economy, it tends to reduce the
moral and physical strength of
the nation; that when it takes
from one man to bestow on
another, it diminishes the incen-
tive of the first, the integrity of
the second, and the moral auto-

. nomy of both;

THAT we will be free only so
long as the national sovereignty
of the United States is secure;
that history shows periods of
freedom are rare, and can exist
only when free citizens can-
certedly defend their rights
against all enemies;

THAT the forces of international
Communism, are at present the
greatest single threat to these
liberties;

THAT the United States should
stress victory over, rather than
coaexistsnce with this menace;
an

THAT American foreign policy
must be judged by this criterion:
does it serve the just interests
of the United States?"

To the Editor:

A deeply moving gesture of
human concern will take place
this Christmas season in the form
of an interfaith pilgrimage start-
ing in Buffalo going across the
Peace Bridge and into Canada.
On Dec. 29, a procession of
clergy, laymen and students un-
der the co-sponsorship of Clergy
and Layman Concerned about
Vietnam, the Catholic, Jewish
‘and Episcopal Peace Fellowship
and a Quaker Action Group will
walk across the bridge to deliv-
er parcels of medical aid to
sympathetic Canadians to be sent
on for Vietnam relief. A worship
service, briefing session, and
press conference will proceed
the crossing and earlier in the
week participants will be going
to their local post offices to mail
packages of medical aid to Red
Cross organizations of North
Vietnam, South Vietnam, and the
National Liberation Front.

It must he stressed that this
move is in no way politically
oriented. Although people who
participate are liable to prosecu-
tion under the Trading with the
Enemy Act they are willing,’ to
risk the threat of prosecution
because of a higher concern for
the suffering of human lives.

It is hoped that an interfaith
Pilgrimage will awaken in our
own people an awareness of what
the peace spirit of Christmas
means — not in abstraction, but
in action.

If you are interested in going
on the pilgrimage and want fur-
ther information or need addres-
ses of the Red Cross groups in
order to send medical supplies,
please get in contact with Walter
Clark (457-7934) or Sheila 0'-

Deep down within the phantas-

lies a demon of hideous and
hoary visage. A satanic figure;
howling fircy blackened oaths

was the main threat to the Free

these campuses? Oh, I know,
