American citizens and not even
to raise funds for the succor of
more than a million and a half
homeless Arab refugees.

England and America never
ceased to support the state of
Israel. They jointly created it
against the will and welfare of
the indigenous inhabitants; Eng-
land by allowing Jews to immi-
grate to Palestine while it was
a mandate and America by re-
cognizing the new state before
it even gabled any land. They
jointly protected it, financially,
militarily and politically; andthe
past years have enough evidences
for any one who can read. The
most recent of these is the de-
claration by Mr. Johnson immed-
iately before the 5th of June
that the American Government
supports the “territorial in-
tegrity” of ALL nations of the
Middle East. This declaration
was mysteriously dropped from
the Official U.S. policy stand
after the Arabs were defeated.
’The question then is to whose
welfare and security was the
President’s declaration made?
America and England have tre-
mendous economic and strategic
interests in the Middle East; and
to acquiesce and satisfy all the
whims and pranks of an illegi-
timate child is to lose more
ground to the Russians than they
lost with the creation of the
State of Israel. The interests
of England and America are the
interests of more than 250 mil-
lion people, and consequently the
interests of the Free World,
which should be given priority.
That is not taking into consider-
ation the interests of a hundred
million indigenous inhabitants of
the Middle Eastl The statement
by Rosenberg that "the Arabs of
Jerusalem were granted citizen-
ship” is void oi truth. Reports
by U.N. officials reveal the fact
that the ID. cards of all Arabs
in Israel are stamped with the
letter "B" which denotes a
second-class citizen. 0 have in
my possession some oi these
reports for any one interested.)
In a Jewish State you have to
be a Jew to enjoy the full rights
oi citizenship. Israel is for Jews
ONLY, South Africa and Southern
Rhodesia ior Whites ONLY. We
should aIWnys remember that
Nazi Germany WAS supposed to
be for “Aryans” ONLY!

To the Ed tor:

An organization called the
Young Americans for Freedom
has been the focal point oi much
discussion since its inception
here at State early this semester.
The time has come to separate
fact from fiction. Unmlstakably
biased statements made by people
who know next to nothing about
YAF cannot be allowed to stand
unchallenged.

 

 

 

YAF,‘ftIilldOd in teen, is a
nationwide Conservative youth
organisation. with over 400
chapters in 60 states. do the
National Advisory Board of YAF
arr” members of Congress,
and such distiuuished Ameri-
cans as Gen. A. Bradshaw, Wil-
liam F. Buckley, Gen. Mark
Clark, Gov. Ronald Reagan, plus
many professors, business and
religious leaders.- '

The Shara statement, which
sets forth the basic beliefs of
YAli‘, isepentosllioreaaminap
tin. Those who are ignorant
what a Ctmservative philostphy
is. are in no position to explain
YAP's credo. Just what is a
Conservative? Congressionall'te-
presentstive Durward Hall (R-
Mo.) clearly answered this ques-
tion in a national column this
summer: “All he wants is to
keep the nation financtu sol-
vent, to allow the maximum op-
portunity for each individual to

go as farashistalent, skilland
incentive will take him, to
strengthen and improve our free
enterprise system, to keep taxes
from soaring out of sight, to
maintain a strong national de-
fense against the admitted intent
oi the Communists to bury us, to
maintain the basic principles set
forth in the Custltution, and to
be eternally vigilant in the de-
fense of our basic liberties and
freedom." This is YAF. Mem-
bers of YAF are proud to be
Americans and feel no shame in
displaying the American flag.
Conservatives have traditionally
acted as a restraining force on
those who wish to reduce the
Constitutional rights oi the
states.

Selling computers, rocket en-
gines, and radar units to East
European nations will not bring
the fruits ofAmerican capitalism
to these "enslaved nations"—it
will bring us one step in the di-
rection of national suicide. Many
of these strategic products can
very easily be resold to Russia
and or North Vietnam. Senator
Karl Mundt elaborated on this
East-West trade in a Speech be
fore the Senate this year: “It is
indeed a sorry day in American
history, Mr. President, when

or President and State Depart-
ment concentrate their efforts
on such matters as setting up
new consular regulations with
Russia, in an effort to expand
even further our already uncon-
scionable traffic in blood with
Communist countries by propos-
ing to expand East-West trade,
rather than concentrating onwhat
is required to cause Russia to
reduce or stop her steadily grow-
ing shipments oi oil, weapons,
and ammunition .to the North
Vietnam Communists, who use
them to kill America's finest
fighting men.” Communists
possess a mutual ideological in-
terest — the desire to establish
their system in every nation in
the world. William Randolph
Hearst Jr., Editor-in-Chicf of
one oi the nation's largest news.
paper chains and one who has
been sent on Presidential fact
finding missions, earlier this
year wrote on Russian and
Chinese aims: "And anybody who
says they have stopped trying to
take over the world is either
misinformed, blind, a boob or
is one oi them." he went on to
write, "One thing is certain:
The’ Communists, whether they
be Russian, Chinese, Albanian
or Cuban, are never going to
give up trying. He believes
that the people of a nation have
the right to decide their own
form oi government. But, when
a nation tries to impose its
ideology or form of government
on another nation through
violence and war, then the victim
of such coercion is entitled to
any assistance necessary to halt
the offender. YAF does believe
that “the United States should
stress victory over, rather than

, coexistence with Communism."

History has shown that the Com-
munists are following a policy

 

of attempting to convert theworld
to their ideology — through any
means available. Communist ex-
pansionists have been active in
almost every corneroftheworld.
With America’s present no-win
policy, the Communists int/tet-
nam and elsewhere laws that if
their offensive fails, they. will
not lose any territory. This only
encourages more aggressive
“wars of liberation." Such wars
destroy lives and drain our
resources and morale. is
burning draft cards and plucking
daisies truly giving support to
our men in Vietnam? YAF’en-
gages in cmtructive projects—
collecticn books, gifts, soap, and
blood for shipment to Vietnam.
One of the most important things
YAF can do to support our armed
forces is to prevent more Viet-
nams. Nations, whether or not
they be Communist, must be
made to realise that their exis-
tence will be threatened if they
choose a cause of violence to
achieve their goals. Ask your-
self "ls peace so precious as
to be purchased at the price of
slavery and chains?" YAF says
NO. ‘ - '

Common Trap

To the Editor:

It seems as if once again a
member of the new right wing
(Ray Bertrand in this case) has
fallen into the common over-
emotional trap of name-calling:
those whose beliefs the review-
er objects to are branded fol-
lowers of Alan Ginsburg (after
all it is true that probing be-
neath the surface of a poem
proves you are a degenerate,
does it not?) It seems Mr. Ber-
trand has flattered himself in-
to thinking Alan Ginsburg his
arch opponent, and that all those

ideas he objects to are found in
his poetry. Mr. Bertrand goes
on to show how those whose
ideas he disagrees with are pot-
smoking, free - loving society
drop-outs. In between all his
clever puns he throws around
the word democracy as if it
were a specific moral code. Since
when is democracy 2 license to
condemn people’s private ac-
tions and their thoughts? How
many times have we heard the
right wing advocates say that the
protesters are lucky to live in
a society where they have the
liberty to speak their minds then
go right on to condemn their ac-
tions as being adverse to this
very democracy’s functioning?
What is the proper way to act?
Carry placards praisingthe right
to protest?

“if every male participated in
this action" (draft card.burn-
ing) would the US survive he
asks. That would be the major-
ity then, wouldn’t it, and as he
previously stated we must, in
a democracy, bow to the major-
ity's rule. The reviewer should
not contradict himself when the
opposite side is in the major-
ity, What survival is he hoping
for, that of people who have ob-
jected to injustice, or that of
flags and eagles?

He asks if terror is how a
democratic society accomplish-
es its goals. Obviously it is what
is happening, for if Mr. Ber-
trand would stop worrying about
the reality of trees he would
see this is precisely what the
US. is doing in Viet Nam. War
is not as glorious as it sounds
to those who prefer to condemn
peace while comfortably watch-
ing “reality” within their lim-
ited confines. it is easy to be a
hero in Albany. it seems as if a
monolithic national mind is Mr.
Bertrand‘s idea of democracy,
for to him dissent is undemocra-
tic and idealism for misfits.
l vaguely recall having heard
of a mass mind somewhere bev
fore.

Point

In ‘MacBird’ Reading

by Herb Glemblott

Some sensitive feathers might
have been ruffled, but this cock-
fight satisfied even the squeam-
ish with the humor of its
savagery. The Golden Eye has
rarely seen such a large aud-
ience, and the audiencehas rarely
seen such sparkle in the Eye as
"MacBird."

The teeimical assistant, Lucius
Barre, cooled the glare of a pa-
tient, but overcrowded Eye, with
refreshing wit, as he introduced
the play and players. Background
music ushered in Shakespearean
atmosphere; Stratton Rawson ai-
fected'a hilariously pretentious
prologue; and it was begun.

were an effective triad which
gave elucidating socialcommeu.
Joyce Levy and Steve Brock-
house, who played the daughter
and crony of 'MacBird' respec-
tively, enacted their parts pre-
cisely as the play warranted, as
did Bob Cutty, the side to 'King
Ken O’Dunc' and the senator.
This production deserved the
more commodious facilities of a
theater where a larger audience
could have beencomfortsbly seats
ed. Those students who missed
this production deserve a second
opportunity to be regaled.

that the prose and poetry selec-

caiumny via carricature of the
camp of Kennedy (King Ken 0'-
Dunc - Stuart Salomon) and the
camp of Johnson (MacBird-Wil-
liam Rhode). Robert Ken O‘Dlmc
was played by Michael Ruther-
ford.

The effect of reading parts in-
stead of acting put extra power
in the text. The verbal scenery
and graphic music provided more
than ample background.

lnvective was tossed about as
freely as pigskin in touch foot-
ball. Neither the Kcn O’Duncs
or the MacBlrds went unscath-
ed (nor any others within the po-
litical spectrum).

Memorably, MacBird labeled
Robert Ken O’Dunc a ‘twerp.’
To paraphrase MacBird, ‘Ah can
tolerate attacks own me, but ah
can’t tolerate attacks on the Proz-
idaint,’ (after he had attained
the highest office).

Congratulations go to director
Alex Krakower and his assistants
Dan Stimmerman (‘Earl of War-
ren') and Stratton Rawson (the
‘Egg of Head' - Adlai Steven-
son), who were standouts.

Ellen Rogers was an aptly
shrewish 'Lady MacBird.’ Wil-
liam Rhode convincingly played
‘MacBird' and was most amus-

After last Friay night’s Doors
concert at RPI, I heard the some
comment over and over, “Great,
but too short." Tint’s how good
the concert was because actually,
the Doors were on for an hour,
remectable time for any group,
and yet the audience was so en-
raptured that time lost all mean-

ing.

Jim Morrison, their vocalist,
provedtobeallthefreakhewas
predicted to be. Most of the time
he stood in wierd contorted po-
sitions, softly caressing his mi-
crophone, and then as his vocal
dynamics accelerated, so did his
body, moving, literally jumping
about the stage.

Morrison's voice along with
Ray Manzarek's classical, cathe-
dral-like organ combined for the
eerie, M, supernatural, haunt-
ing sound clmracteristic of the
group.

Ray Manzarek in essence held
the music together, filling in the
gaps left by an only three man
instrumental backup. His impro-
visions in the super-extended
“Light My Fire" and "The Mu-
sic's Over" were magnificent,
although his range is hampered
because of the classical effect
he is trying to achieve. The con-
stant dialogue between his organ
and Morrison's voice was prob-
ably the most impressive feature
of the group.

My chief criticism of the con-
cert was the small selectionthey
included. Of their recorded sous
they played "Brukahroughﬂ
“Alabama Song," "Back Door
Man" (incidentally, with a very
slick and effective transition
from the former tolatter), "Peo-
ple Are Strange," "When. The
Music's Over" and “Light My
Fire.”

As you see from the above,
they still are depending rather
strongly on material from their
first album, which could mean
tint they have not periectedtbeir
presentation of songs from their
new disc. Unfortunately, their
new recordincludes someoftheir
best (and my favorite) material.

To be very frank, Iwas quite
apprehensive about wintthequslp
ity of their, performance would
be after hearing and reading so
many conflicting comments on
their concerts. I found tint the
Doors and especially Morri-
son wove a spell over the and-
ience, captured them and then
let them go when they really
wanted to remain. What more
could be said but, “Great, but
too short."

Since reconsiderations seem
to he the vogueamongcolumnists
this year, I think lwill adda
few of my own. Last week I
wrote the “Country Joe and the
Fish" had a "Jade East" style,
well, after further listening this
generalization cannot hold for
their new alum although it is
ctnracteristic of their first.

Secondly, it has been brought
to my attention dist loverempha-
sised my personal opinions of
Buffy Salute-Marie and, there-
fore, neglected time of the sod.

all. it is my column.
