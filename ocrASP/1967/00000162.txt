Choral To Perform
Handel’s ‘Messiah’

Today, Tomorrow

Two periormsnces of Handel's
"Messiah" will be presentedby
the Capitol Hill choral Society,
under the direction of Judson
Rand, on Friay, December in
and Saturday, December is, at
8:30 p.m. at Cinndellora Hall,
Albany. As in the past, the Chor-
al Society will sing the Messiah
in its entirety.

Soloiste for the two perform-
ances, all of whom areyoungpro-
fessiomls from the New York
City area, are: Emily Derr, so-
prano; Joan Kerssnbrock, con-
tralto; Carroll Alexander, tenor;
and Edward Pierson, bass.

Miss Derr, who has ind ex-
tensive eaperience as an era.-
torio soloist, has toured as so-
prano solist with thaltobert Shaw
Chorale and the Robert D.Cor-
mier Singers.

Joan Kersenbrock, a native of
Nebraska, is contrslto soloist
at New York's Incarnation
Church. She has made numerous
appearances as oratorio soloist
under Thomas Dunn's direction.

Carroll Alexander has ind ex-
perience in Broadway musicals
and is well known in New York
as a church soloist and concert
performer.

Bass soloist, Edward Pierson,
a member of the New York City
Opera, has sung the bass solo for
a number oi oratorios and has
appeared frequently as a concert
singer.

The Capitol Hill Choral
Society, new celebrating its 16th
season, has performedtiieiiMes-
slab" nearly every year oi its
existence. The lilo-voice chor-
us, which appeared at the Sara-
toga Performing Arts Center in
August, 1986, will return there
again this summer to sing with
the Philadelphia Orchestra under
Eugene Ormandy's direction.

Tickets for the "Messiah”csn
be purciased from members oi
the chorus, at area music stores,
and at Chancellors Hall on De-

of the exhibition as a whole is
its sise — there are so many
paintings that it is impossible
to absorb them all; the Gallery

the collection, paints tilese rusty

The owressiveness of his “The
Ruins, Lake Callabonna" is
eerie. it shows a man and boy
standing among some large
pieces of driftwood, with a large
expanse of dry, dusty land ex-
tending behind them. Everything
is still, and everything is tint
dusty dry, red orange.

This disturbiu quality is
present in many of the paintings
in this collection. “Mourning
Bride" by Arthur Boyd, for ex-
ample, done in almost surreal
espressio c manner, shows a
bride in a wedding gown falling
in grief upon the stiff, wide-eyed
body of her husband, who lies
in an open coffin. Thecoiiin rests
on the foot oialarga blue-skinned
figure wearing a green shirt and
black pants —prenimably Death.

Another, “Women in Bath" by
Brett Whitley, is equally disturb-
ing, but for a different reason.
It is alargecsnvas, approximate-
ly six by seven feet, with the bath-
tub taking up two-thirds of the
space. But then thersissnempty,
looming third of purple'back-
ground which just sits there,
exasperatingly blank. Undoubt-
edly, Whitley designed the com-
position to have just this ef-
fect, the knowledge of which per-
iups makes it all the more dis-
turbing.

in complete antithesis to this
feeling is the tapestry by John
Olsen called “Joie de Vivre"
which has all the exuberance of
a New Year's Eve Party. Froma

The opening number, "Overture and Caccia"
Menotti is from his opera "Last Savage,"
first performed in ices, and was arrangedicrbsnd,
by Philip Lang. it was a very clever number con-
sisting of opposing themes played simultaneously.
One very noticeable feature was the highly diffi-
cult clarinet part which, altlnugh having its rough
seemed to be quite adequately performed.
it was a rather leuthy number, and became rath-
er tiresome before it finally came to its abrupt
and unexpected ending.

Persichetii’s “Symphony No. 6 for Band" was
probably the best performed selection of the en-
tire concert. This symphony had its first per-
formance in less, and is one of Persichetti's
"largest works." The crescendos and decrescen-
dos which were used quite effectively in this num-
ber were very very well executed, as were the
sync off beat entrances by the various in-
struments throughout the piece. The brass per-
formed quite brilliantly producing a clear tone,
thus adding great mice through its entrances and
good use of dynmios.

one great weakness seemed to be inherent in
this number, and this was lack of good clear tone
quality. There seemed to be an overabundance
of flutes and clarineis which at times simply took
over with breathy sounds, injuring the tone quality,
despite the accomplishment oi the brass. This was
particularly noticeable in the very expressive
Augie. The best moments tone-wise were at double
forte.

The tympsny in this number was outshnding.
The entire percussion section performed admir-
ably, but the tympany really made the number the

iacle tint it was. This instrument can be so

oi the part itself, Glassbrook was really excit-

well-known tunes as "l've Got Plenty of Noth-
ing," "Bess You is My Woman," “Summer-
time,” and "it Ain't Necessarily so.” The band
played this well, particularly once the number was
under way (afterswell-covered slipbythetrumpet).
i did not, however, like the arrangement, despite
the fact that it was done by Russell Bennett.
(No fault oi the hand.) These watered-down med-
leys are all alike — you simply can't find one tint

ere. This particular one lost

most oi the Gershwin flavor and subtle rhythm,
and was filled with abrupt theme clunges which
detracted from the overall continuity.

' Then came the big moment — “Rhapsody in
Blue." The clarinet performed the very diffi-
cult opening quite admirably, but then the hand
proceeded to lose the feeling for the number and
progressed rather roughly until it came to the
inmous instrumental theme played without the
piano. From that point on things began
and they really did quite a respectable job.

Cockrell was rather severely over-powered by
the band's volume, thus his smooth touch were
lost. In addition, he played his part too fast at
points. I really felt that this work needed con-
siderably more polishing.

One thing which surprised me was the band's
size —- it seems to have grown. They performed
some very difficult music, and quite well at
tint. One thing disturbed me, however, and that
was the tone quality and balance. As i mention-
seemed to be dominated by a large
woodwind section (particularly clarinets and flutes)
which deadened the tone making it rather blend.
in this respect the brass saved the day.

l always enjoy watching Hudson direct. He has
a semis yet classy style which certainly adds“!
to a concert performance. it was one oi the band's
better comerts. Their improvement during the
past three years ins been marvelous, but I shall
be looking forward to still greater improvements

Somebody once said that the
wide screen 'is suited best for
filming battleships and people
in bed. Though it ins refresh-
ineg little of the latter, Rob-
ert Wise's "The Sand Pebbles,"
which I have finally gotten round
to seeing, fully exploits theform-
er. Wise extracts the maximum
from both advantages of the wide
screen: compositional depth of
field and its splendid possibilities
for spectacle.

The film is concerned with the
aodon surrounding a 0.8. gunboat
during the Chinese Civil wars of
the 1920s. it has manyoitha war-
, film cliches wahavebecome used

 

 

only about 4 x 5 inches in also,

and minutely detailed.

The large variety oi schools
represented in this collection
makes The Australian Painters
a unique and interesting show.
As in any large collection there
are some good and some bad
works, but in general, the span
of the styles and the sometimes
peculiarly Australian concepts
make it a worthwhile experience.

“The Doors", playing before a capacity audience at RPI
last weekend, brought comments at “Great, but too short."
(See review page H).

to since “Sergeant York" (e.g., l
during a battle, a sneaky enemy
is about to dispatch your buddy,
and just in time you dispatch the
enemy). in its handling of the hu-
man relationships — Captain vs.
crew, pacifistic missionary vs.
militarist captain, sailor in love
with C hlnese whore, sailor in love
with pretty missionary — it is
not much above comic-strip stuff.
What makes "The Sand Peb-
bles” interesting, though, is the
way it loads its conventional
form with a measure oi sub-
stance. In part this is due to

‘ i

the excellent acting oi Steve Mc- 

Queen, Richard Attenborough, ‘
and Richard Crenna. Manson's
Jake Holman, ship's engineer and
plot's protagonist, is n Heming-
wayesque loner, obsessed with
getting ids job done right, at
bottom on no man's side but his
own — the sort oi role Bogart
might havo played 20 years ago.
Attenborough, as the sailor who
lavas the Malay girl, sndCrennn,
as the by-the-hook captain, flesh
out parts that could have become
stereotypes.

Moreover, the picture is giv- j. i

on body by Wise's remarkably
complex treatment oi the story's
political issues. The iirst shot
is an overhead view of a bustling
Oriental port, a flotsom oi drab
browns and greys; suddenly a
gunboat moves into the frame
and sailors in white disembark
and spread through the crowd;
a perfect visual metaer for
the Americans' intrusivsness
that we see again and again in
the film.

tion oi the Liverpool quartet,
“TN Medical. Mystery Tour."

'Tour' is an actual musical
comedy, a television show writ-
ten, produced, and directed by
the Duties. Packaged in a strik.
ingly coloer album (complete
with cartoon drawings of andpic.
tune from the show), the Beat-
lss' new record is a surprising-
Ilhy pleasant, enjoyable romp

rough various styles oi mod--
ern musical composition.

The opening number, "Magical
Mystery Tour," is a irolicsome
burst of joyous sounds, an in-
vltstion to the ‘tour' (itself pos-
sibly a satire on the chief events
of the "life voyage")

Used with incredible skill is
the piano award noticeably at
the end of the song, producing a
modern jazz effect) and brass
(employed in a short interlude
before the final verse in a per-

the Tiajuana Brass or
the Baja Marimba Band).

The next song, "The Fool on
the Hill," less the airy beauty
oi a pastoral tone-poemJts light,
airy qillity is deceiving: the song
sadly details the alienated plight
of the “fool” who sits on the hill
("hr from the madding crowd's
lgnoble strife” with apologies to
Goldsmith).

His head in the clouds, he
buries himself in the problems
oi the world. Used with marve-
lous success is an electronic
flute whose whining pipings are
a delicious understatement to the
complaint oi the "fool."

“Flying,” the number that fol-
lows, is an instrumental. This
pleasant tune soars gracefully on
the wings of a slow, easy beat
that is soon joined by percus-
sion and~guitars, then comple-
mented by a quiet voice arrange-
ment. The number concludes with
an Oriental-sounding stressing
oi the crash.

Harrison's composition was
the song "Blue Jay Way," simi-
lar to ids other musical writings
in that it is concerned with the
difficulty of human communica-
tion and understanding.

The organ (so popular at pres-
ent with folk-rock groups, as in
The Association's "Requiem for

Wise's attitude is ambivalent.
As a whole, theChinese in the pic-
ture are either noxioust servile
(“Yes boss you betchn.")
or mindlessly violent; the Amer-
ican crew, with few exceptions,
calloust exploit and torment the
Chinese. in one kind oi war pic-
ture, the captain's chauvinism
would be dominant, and in anoth-
er the misslonary's Christianity
would win out. (Viet Nam skulks
in the background here, and Wise
ins beefed up the film with casual
hints in that direction.)

But “The Band Pebbles" shuns
both to conclude with a view oi
Holman, slumped by a crated en-
line, with thecaptain and the mic-
sionary sprawled on the ground
before him - all killed by Na-
tionalist Chinese snipers. This
frouping, as formal as a
Renaissance panel, has a note of
futility surprising in n Holly-
wood super-production.

"The Sand Pebbles" is an ex-

ity. Yet he insists tlat others
are confused, that they “have lost
their way."

The loveliest song on the album
is “Your Mother Should Know,"
of the English music-hall variety
so favored by the Tessie O'Shea
class of singers. steeped in the
rich vein of corny sentiment, the
song is as modestly inoffensive
as the low whisper ofpsst mel-
lowness and just as beautifully
umssuming and romantic. '

Before l discuss the final
number of the show, '“1 Am the
Walrus" (the comedy routine?),
1 will quickly complete-one gen-
eral musical note on ‘ell the
songs concerning the background
instrumental accompaniment.

Though this influence was
greatly muted in 'Sgt. Pepper,’
drums, bass, guitars and percus-
sion are very much inevldence in
‘Tour,’ employed with inndsome
results to create a domineering,
hypnotic beat.

in ‘Walrus,’ the strings are
very important, including bass
and viola. The song uses amulti-
tude of sound effects and unusual
voice harmonizatlons, with sfan-
tactic ending tint combines
sound, music, voices and client,
mixed together in a maddenineg
mscinating finale.

At this point, we enter the
hazardous, controversial terri-
tory of opinionated interpreta-
tion. Wint does the ‘walrus'sym-
bolize? One idea is obvious: the
face of this creature is usually
marred by deep wrinkles andfea-
tures alarge,hushy"mustache,"
the very picture of an old man.

Throughout the song, the idea
of punishment ofyouthis implied:
the boy lets his “face grow
long" and is derided as "naugh-
ty," as is the girl who lets her
"knickers down."

The “penguins” (normally di-
minitive in size) are criticized
for “singing Hare Krishna"
(studying Oriental culture) when
they “should have seen them kick-
ing Edgar Allen Poe" (a dream-
er, concerned with the collapse
of the Universe as reflected in
the men — meanderings of the
mind).

The 'walrus' weeps for the
"dead dog's eye" ripped open
as if to symbolize the modern
philosophical interest with the
visions of the "inner eye." He
praises social conformity (“i
am he as you are he as you are
me and we are all together").

He disdains “stupid bloody
Tuesday" (the Rolling Stones
song “Ruby Tuesday" was nslsp
at conventional middleclass
morality). He calls the chem-
pions of the new moral code
"pornagrephlc priestesses."

citing film. The one-eighty-odd
minutes go by quickly, except for
some pachydermOus interludes
provided by Candice Bergen's
tacky simperings and Mnrayat
Andrisne's tedious Oriental pas-
sivity. Wise has put a lot into the
picture — some absorbing vis-
uals (swift tracking shots, strik-
ing compositions), a sense of ac-
tion and masculine exportiso(Mc-
Queen running the ship's engine
looks like he really belongs
there), and some ﬂuent cutting.

l have my doubts about the
overall style, though; bynnd large
it is dehlched and anonymous,
bearing no stamp of u personal
vision. indeed, Wise leaves us
disturbed oi the finale, confront-
ing the tableau of death 1 men-
tioned that it is legitimate to
ask if this nihilism is deeply
felt by the same man who made
“The Sound of Music." But may-
be l'm being harsh. The overall
maturity of "The Sand Pebbles"
does much to raise hopes for Wise
as a beiter-thsn-oversge com-
mercial director.

Folded, spindled, Mutilated 

by Francine Hols

Presented in arein style in
the Hawley T.V. Studio, and di-
rected by Martin Mans, “The
Adding Machine" used mass me-
dia, masks and numerous other
devices which added a freshness
and excitement to the production.
One could not help but acknowl-
edge iis carefully planned and
polished nature. But, unfortunate-
ly, a "production" is all that it
was.

The reason for this lies not
so much in the performance as
in the script itself. Rice’s play
is based upon the lifeofan
everyman named appropriately,
Mr. Zero. Plagued by a nag-
ging wife, tormented by his sex-
ual desires for the prostitute
across the hall, and frustrated
by his inability to approach the
girl-et-theoffice, Zero is in-
deed a failure.

After twenty-five years with
"the company," he is replaced
by an adding machine. At his
home during a typical business-
man's party a policeman sud-
denly arrivss to arrest Zero:
he has murdered the boss.

Tried, convicted and sentenced
to death, Zero descends to the
underworld, and because, in mur-
dering his boss, Zero was for
one moment true to his emo-
tions, he finds himself in the
Elysian Fields.

Rejecting the "immoral"pasi-
times of the abode of the good
and the girl-at-the-office (Miss
Daisy Devore) whom he meets
there, he is condemned to work
out his time on the adding ma-
chine in hell, only to return
for another try at earthly ex-
lstance.

What indeed has Rice said
to us with all this? That peo-
ple are victims of machines,
systems, bosses and codes and
that the truly virtuous man re-
jects these and lives by his
true feelings? Certainly, this is
not a new idea. As a play "The
Adding Machine" neither takes
us to the heights nor the depths
of the questions.

The actors, however, did much
to enlnnce the play with their
well delineated and skillful per-
formances. Ed Kramer, as Mr.
Shrdlu, who warns Zero of the
Elysian evils, gave one of the
most enjoyable and believable
performances done his long time.

Certainly, he captured and held
the audiences imagination from
his first flusiered entrance.

Karen Prete as the three wom-
en in Zero's life, was adequate,

but uneven. Her beslperiormance
came at the begiming with her
portrait of the nagging wife, which
was both delightful andconvinc-
ing. As a sexual object (the

prostitute, Miss Q'Grady) and as
the adoring imocent

sync--

(Del
vore) she was less convinciiu,
and oftensoundedssifshewere
reading lines rather than acting.

Scott Regan, in the lead role‘

of Mr. Zero, did an admirable
Mimi. '33“ “'“°
en, shaking
with intensity, he progress-
ed irom good to smerb. Finally,
William Snyder also deserves
rscogniiion for the ease and pol-
ish oi ids role as the boss.
The real emphasis in the pro-
diction wss technical, however.
Throughout the play, 1W. sets
and a movie screen were used
to present pictures of the clar-
acters' thoughts or other appro-
priate motifs.Certainly,themost
startling sequence was Miss
Prete's strip and subsequent ges-
tures.
it may have been that the se-
quence was too long or merely in
bad taste, but somehow it fell
short of the desired effect of
sensuality.
Another technique employed
was the use of masks to make

each clurscter look like Mr. and
Mrs. Zero. Later during the
Mil. Zero limbo tears
off his mask as his soul is final-
ly revealed. Thus, metaphorical-
ly, the audience is shown tint all
people hide behind false ester-
lors and that when they reveal
their true selves, they are re-
jected. Thus Zero, won re-
moving mesk iscondsmned.
This proves mosi affective.

Lesa effective was the actors
intarmindings and directing
lines to the audience whichseeni-
ed to sliemte rather tlaninvolve
most people.

Scene clanges did not live up
to the perfection of other tech-
nical aspects for they took en-
tirely too long breaking all mood
of the play.

Perhaps the most startling as-
pect of this production was its
stark endingwhich leftallclnrac-
ters on stage. As one viewer
phrased it "i feel folded spindl-
ed and mutilated by an ending

Cmema 11--

by Roy Siannnn

 

 

Eartiv, robust humor charac-
terizes the new film version of
Shakespeare's “The Taming of
the Shrew." starring Richard
Burton and Elizabeth Taylor as
the bickering lovers, and Cyril
Cusak as Taylor's long-suffer-
ing father, the film begins in ex-
citement and steadily gathers mo-
mentum to a solid and matri-
monally profound ending.

The plot itself is probably so
well known that it needs little
mention, but as the title implies,
Burton, as the swagger-ing
Petruccio, eventually conquers
and tames the blustering,
screaming Katerina, gaining a
gold-laden dowry as well nsanew

e.

The acting is uniformly good.
Burton is alternatineg crass and
subtle, rowdy and reserved.
Wearing a full beard, he's a this
man's Falstaff, but with a clev-
erer aptitude. Miss Taylor is
perfect in her role. Shetoosways
between emotions of coy charms
and out-and-out anarchy. Whether
smashing clairs or dustingthem.
she projects earthy vitality with-
out sacrificing a nobler concept
of womanhood.

Cusak is brilliant as Taylor's
befuddled and tired father, who
is determined to get both of
his taughters married off be-
fore he dies. ln one scene where

 

Taylor is supposed to bedressed
for her wedding and is to walk
with her father, Cusak waits ner-
vously for her to open her bed-
room door and appear ready for
the ceremony.

After moments of silence, she
finally comes out dressed and
serene, and the look on Cusak's
face showing absolute surprise if
not astonishment, equally
matches if not outdoes the and-
ience's response to the fact that
she isn't throwing anything at
anybody or screaming taunts and
threats of a mostly undecipher-
able origin.

Not directed as the filming of
a stage play, but carried through
cinematically, we see close-isle,
overhead and medium cinema
shots to accentuate the difficult
scenes. it is s bawdy but taste-
fully done film and the violence
of some of the funniest scenes
makes Burton's and 'lbylor's
"Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?" look like a climactic
scene from “Ozzie and Harriet."

The technicolor was not done
with crayolas, and its effect
heightens the late - medieval
and early Renaissance atmos-
phere. As a comedy, its domes-
tic humor holds up excellently
and outweighs much of wint is
passed off today for wit and
humor.
