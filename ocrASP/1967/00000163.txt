Bosson’s New Works
Produce Excitement

by Goil Soiion

“The New Paintings" of Jack
Bosson opened at the Art Gal-
lery in the Fine Arts building
Thursday, Dec. 7. The artist,
a member of the Department of
Art, has achieved through form
and color a vibrating excitement
for which he strove less success-
fully in the past. in his exhibi-
tions last year, his paintings vi-
brated because red and green
always vibrate when placed to-
gether. Now, although the color
has by no means boon relegated
to a secondary importance,
seems to Join together with the
forms, angles and curves to pro-
duce new and exciting dimen-
sions.

.—

Bosson's brushwork is flat; -

there is no texture but the plane
of his paintings is by no means
thus. The various areas of color
seem to move and change before
the eyes. The largest of Bosson's
paintings, “Mesmerold”, is es-
pecially effective in thismanner.
it is an imposing and exciting
panel of colors which catch the
eye and carries it up and down,
in and out, among the various
levels and planes.

in the course of his growth
as a painter, Bosson has moved
from whole, clearly defined fi-
gures to abstractions of them,
enioylna tho way the forms work
together. Although the edges are
at times ambiguous and tend to
oscillate, they are never vague.
tie concerns himself with do-
igloping, improving, and clarify-

"Alan's Blue" is a refresh-
ingl‘y clear, crisp. pﬂlnunﬂ- A
gen e blue background or shape
,(dopending on how you look at
it) is juxtaposed with two clean-
ly cut black shapes, underlined
with a yellow curve of color, and
accented with a rose-colored
form. in Bosson’s earlier work
he was almost exclusively con-
cerned with nodes; now he has
enlarged the forms so that we
are left with only the curve oi
a waistline, or the fullness oi
a breast. Thus we can com-
prehend more fully the beauty
of the line itself, the erotociam
falling secondarily and perhaps
more meaningfully into a sug-
gestive and generalized, rather
than blatant, position. A total

 

 

 

feeling can be derived rather
than a self-conscious “Playboy”
snicker. Boseon feels a strong
relationship between sensinlity

and art, and his forms are con-

cerned with the organic and geo-
metric.

The artist was trained in ab-
stract expressionism, but his
work now is sort oi an anti-
thesis to it. He remains an ab-
stractionist; his expressiveness,
however, lies not in the element
of the picture, but in the total
compostion. He calls himself a
classicist in his concept oi art
in terms of balance. His con-
vasses are getting larger, and
larger, striving to be almost an-
vironmental in impact.

Bosson has a great conscious-
ness of the interrelationships
between forms, and in the use
of positive and negative space.
Chapes that recede and shapes
that come forward.) One of the
paintings on the balcony, en-
titled "Where you Are," plays
with this idea quite effectively.
There is a bright, two-toned
“frame” of orange geometrical
shapes around the edges oi the
painting. Being the brightest,
sharpest form, the orange seems
to come forward, to be in front
oi the other areas oi the paint-
ing, including awhite space which
is really the border on one side.
in the middle is a black shape
and two blue shapes with a white
form in the center. Now here
is where the ambiguity occurs.
We may consider that we are
looking through the back, which
then becomes an inner frame
to the blue beyond. The central
white space can fall between the
two blues, or behind them. Or
the blue forms can be viewed
as being in front of the black,
thus making the black is back-
ground. Where - you - are -
in "Where You Are" constant-
ly changes, becoming an almost
visual game.

Bosson finds that artists tend
to take themselves tooseriously,
becoming too conscious of their
Great Moments oi Creation. This
is not to say that Bosson is not
serious about his work, but that,
as an expression of himself he
Enjoys it, and is relaxed within

Freshmen Problems '

"Damn it” was a composite
of show tunes and original songs
written by Steve Hirsch and bad
a story based on that oi DAMN
YANKEES. Although the show was
mostly musical, its dialogue re-
vealed a human story, that oi
a freshman's problem upon an-
tering college.

Our hero, Narcissus is a
mixed-up, “stupid, ugly lool."
After a few agonizing weeks, in
college Narcissus finds that he
has not improved at all. When
his frustrations overpower him
Lucifer the devil, appears
offers to transform him from his
present state into Mark Dash—
Big Man On Campus.

Lucifer explains that he has
helped all famousstudent lead-
ers to achieve their status. Nar-
cissus, is unable to resist Luci-
ier’s offer. And with a typically
theatrical flash of light and a
crashing noise, Narcissus be-
comes Mark Dash.

Mark becomes president oi
the freshman class, captain oi
the football team, and president
oi the fencing society andamem-
ber oi “Padder Club." Girls are
hanging from his. . .limbs, but
he is still unhappy because he
loves Willow, who is too far
beneath him and therefore out
oi reach.

Lucifer

cannot understand

 

Mark's discontent and decides
that the only thinghenoodsnow
is a mistress. To do the job,
he produces Lola—a beautiful,
sensual blond who takes Mark
away to the pleasures of the
bedroom. ,To complicate matters,
Lola who was assigned only to
seduce Mark, falls in love with
him. With her love for him, she
convinces Mark that he must
return to his normal state of
being. And thus, Mark returns
to his former self, Narcissus,
non-enterprising but content.

Excellent Songs

Each song, besides being mus-
ically entertaining, added to the
story line. Although some oi the
songs were popular favorites,
they were well integrated into
the show. Steve Hirsch's origin-
al songs had the professional
ﬂavor oi Broadway. Mr. Hirsch
has written an admirable variety
oi signs including: "What's to
Become oi Me?” which was so
well expressive oi the feelings of
an incoming freshmen and “Pic-
ture Yourself" a bouncy, melody
forecasting Narcissus' future.
Any one oi these (and several
other) songs could be taken out
oi the context oi the show, and
easily become a popular song
hit. Mr. Hirsch is indeed a tal-
ented musician of. unlimited po-
tential; he has produced beauti-
fully effective melodies and also
excellent lyrics.

Talented Director

"Damn it" was conceived and
directed by Jay Hershkowitz.
Don't let his 5'4" appearance
deceive you; he is a true "super-
Fresh." Forllershkowitz to at-
tempt such a production is an
accomplishment; to have it be-
come such a success in an
credible wonder. Working with
only his small troupe behind him,
without any professional help, and
only a limited amount of equip-
ment, Hershkowitz has produced
a full-scale freshman show. in
addition to directing the show,
Hershkowitz was forced by his
cast to play the role oi Mark

Other Characters Excellen_t

A more sinister Lucifer could
not have been cast than Bill

oi lines and songs was compli-
mented by his sly devilish ap-
pearance. Arnie Post we amus-
ing as the typical beer-drinking
college freshman.

Marshall Winkler, as Narcis-
sus, has the unassuming inno-
cence so necessary for his role.
His musical and dramatic contri-
butions to the show were highly
effective; he was very, very
cute. Jo Earl, portrayingWillow,
was a lovable sweetheart as any
freshman could want.

Mary Carney's vibrant enthu-
siasm in playing her secondary
role was indicative of the youth-
fulness of today'sfreshman. Mar-
sha Burek, portraying Lola, mas-
tered the split nature of her
character well.

When Lisa Brier danced onto
the stage in the finale, she was
nothing short of a spectacle of
electrical excitement.

“Pooplo"— Highlight of Show

Rae Ann Cruxiail's beauty and
the lilting charm oi her voice
were quite exciting. The emo-
tional impact that her version oi
"People" had upon the audience
was phenomenal.

The finale of the show brought
tears to our eyes especially when
Rae Ann Crandali came iorthand

Joined Miss Crandall in sing-
ing “Sweet Beginning." Because
that song was so expressive of

that it would have been better

see that this is only a “sweet
beginning” oi bigger and better

Much of the art that is creat-
ed nowadays ls abstract in new
ture, and difficult for the non-
artist to comprehend without ex-
tra or inside information. Mr.
Bosson thinks that the reason
the public does not understand
the new art is because they are
basically not interested. Any
artist of worth paints not for
the masses but for himself. Even
Da Vincl, although his work was
approved of, and "understood"
by the masses, surely strove for
and felt more than just a satis-
fied feeling that he has achieved
pretty good skin tones on Mona
Lisa's face. Now the artist has
removed recognizable forms and
developed a new vocabulary of
expression. in time, if they care,
the public will come to recog-
nize and understand contempor-
ary abstth art. The emotions
expressed now are essentially
the same as they were five hund-
red years ago when people wept
before paintings of the cruciro
tion. Only the means and the
method have changed.

Bosson's paintings, especially
his newer ones, are full of the
stuff of life and visual excite-
ment. Once you get past the view
"1 can't see what it is so 1
don’t like it,” and let the colors
and planes carry you inward, you
will enjoy his show.

in the Plattsburgh game, truly,

a comedy of errors, Albany built
up a 20 point lead and coasted
from there. All the starters scor-
ed in double figures. Terry Jon-
dan led the way with 27.’l‘he ABC
game was another case. With the
game tied at 60, ABC simply ran
wild against Albany’s faulty full
court press.

The Albany State freshmen
grapplers opened their season on
a somewhat sour note Saturday
as they fell to the Oneonta fresh
by a 24-13 count. Forfeits at
160 and 177 hurt the baby Great
Danes chances considerably, as
they won three of the matches
that were actually wrestled.

Winners for the Great Danes
were: Pete Ranalli at 130, Dave
Jones at 137, and RogerJones
at 145. At 123 Albany's Kevin
Sheehsn was just edged out by a
3-2 score. Ranalli was next and
he wrestled well, outpointing his
opponent by a 6-1 count. Dave
Jones followed Ranaill and he
too dominated his opponent, ashe
piled up points before finally
pinning his man in 7:19.

At 145 Roger Jones made quick
work of his opponent as he put
him away in 3 minutes and 18
seconds. Ted Long wrestled 152
for Albany, and although he lost
by a 4-1 score he did show that
he has sufficientwrestling skills.
At this point the score stood at
Albany 13, Oneoneta 0. However,
two forfeits and two losses in
the last four matches resulted
in the final score of 24-13.

The fresh hoopsters will be
in action tomorrow when they
will host Hartwick at 6:30 p.m.
preceding the varsity encounter
at 8:30 p.m. The fresh grapplers
will not be at home again until
