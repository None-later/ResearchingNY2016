key to the success of our basketball team will be the
play of center Scott Price. Scott’s play is almost always
good, but the amount of time Price gets to play often
varies, according to his foul situation. The victory
over Plattsburgh demonstrates the basis for' my rea-
soning that Price is the key to our basketball success.
in this game price played an obviously more cautious
ballgame and consequently never entered into foul trouble.
Yet Scott Price garnered 23 rebounds to keep the Danes
in charge in the latter part ‘of the game. Price played
as much as Doc needed him, played cautiously, and dom-
f. inated the boards. That is the reason Plattsburgh was
I; defeated. Without Price, a dominating rebounder is
2i lacking although Rich Margison, Larry Marcus, and
 . Jim Caverly have. all shown an ability to chip in with
 ' the backboard chores. Price is needed to get the fast-
‘:' break off in time. Price’s stature is such that when he
stands still, he is an excellent pick. Price’s scoring
, . ability should not be underestimated either.
5 Tomorrow night fans will see a good ballgame. The
i play of the center from Clifton Springs could be the key
.V ' factor in this and all Albany games. Fouls could deter-
} mine the outcome. Scott always plays well, but how much
. time will he get to play?

POINTS in its hoop victory over Plotteburgh.

Grapplers Buried,
Oneonta On Top

by Tom Nixon

in their first.dual meet of
the season, theAlbanyState grap-
plers lost to the Oneonta Red
Dragons by a score of 2745,
this past Saturday. The Great
Danes were able to record only
victory and a draw. In record-
ing 27 points, Oneonta scored
five decisions, all of which, but
one, were decided by more than
two points, and two pins.

Watts Only Winner

Eric Watts, who was the only
winner for Albany in their Invi-
tational two weeks asomslin was
the only victor for the grapplers.
Wrestling in the 123-pound di-
vision, Watts recorded a 12 to
2 decision over Tim O'Hara.
Oneonia then went on to win
the next seven weight classes
before Albany was able to reg-
ister another score.

Bill Schempp opened up the
scoring for Oneonta by regis-
tering an 0-3 decision over Gary
Smagalski in the lac-pound di-
vision. In the 137-pound divi-
sion, Bill Clark of Albany lost
a 4-2 decision to Jay Moore.

Wrestling for Albany in the
146 - pound division was Craig
Springer who wrestled most of
last year, and in the invitational
this year in the le-pound spot.
Despite his drop ofa weight class,
Springer dropped an ll-o de-
cision as he suffered five take-
downs at the hands of Dan D'-
Amboise of Oneonta.

Frank Berry, who also urop-
ped a weight class so tint he could
wrestle in the lilZ-pound division,
lost to Bob Anderson by a score
of 13-3. Both Berry and Sprin-
er seemed to be lacking stamina
as a result of their he"! work.

In the l77-pound class, Roger
Gorham of Albany lost a 9.3 de-
cision to Gary Lehr.

Roger Saul, wrestling for only
the second time, gained the only
other points for Albany as he
was able to wrestle George Mill-
er to a 9-9 draw. Saul, who just
started wrestling this year is
showing great promise and looks
as if he may register some unex-
pected victories for the Great
Danes this year.

The Great Danes wrestle their
next four matches away before
they return on February 10th

win over Utica Tuesday, and lost
one tilt coming at the hands
of a powerful University of But-

The Plattsburgh-Albany score
is not really indicative ofhowfar
superior the Danes were over the
Cardinals. After holding a
precarious four point lead at half-
time, the Dick Sauers' coached
quintet ripped off 10 straight
points at the start of the second
lalf to put the game out ofreach.
Rich Margiaon led the Albany
scoring with 20 markers while
Scott Price added 17.

At Buffalo's Clark Gym, the
Bulls got off to a fast start and
were never headed. The closest
Albany got was six points, 21-
15, midway through the first
inlf. However, in the end the tal-
ent and strength of the Bulls was
too much for the Danes to over-
come. Price led all Dane scor-
ers with 19 as Margison chipped
’n with 17.

The Utica game was nocontest
as seven Albany men hit for
double figures. The purple and
gold opened a 22-12 lead midway
of the first half and increased
it to 40-29 at intermission. sau-

Research Grant
Policy Discussed
By Pres. Collins

President Evan R. Collins com-
mented on the University policy
concerning private and govern-
ment research grants offered to
the University at Monday’s Pres-
ident’s Conference with students.

He stated that according to
the present policy the University
will accept no contracts whose
findings are of such a nature as
to be classified.

He stated that this policy was
in accord with astatsment,drawn
up last January by the Faculty
Senate Committee on Faculty Re-
search, which stimlates that any
funded research involving faculty
shall carry the stipulations that
all findings can be published.

Collins also referred to mis-
understanding over the Univer-
sity's part in Project Themis, a
project designed to “develop new
centers of excellence to provide
new opportunities for research
in the hard sciences.”

lie stated that all 'I‘hemis re-
search is to be unclassified ma»
teriai "so that the results may
be published," thereby meeting
the present University standards.

The University is presently
working on eleven projects of
Operation Themis, mainly in the
field of atmospheric science.

An announcement was also
made of a new policy statement
handed down by the University
Committee to Draft the Univer-

. sity Alcohol Policy dated Jan-

uary 4, 1968.

The policy concerns the sale
and service of alcohol in the Pa-
troon Room, the Rathskelter, and
at the Mohawk and Dippikill pro-
perties. (See Page 11.)

Vice President of Stude’nt Af-
fairs Clifton C. Thorne also an-
nounced the formulation of a new
Kosher food plan by the Student
Affairs Committee in coopera-
tion with the Hillel Society (see
also page 6 for policy.)

Questions were raised as to
the new policy of running the
last buses at 12 midnight on
a weekly basis. Collins comment.
ed that it was originally intend-
ed that the head of the Trans-
portation Service would revise
the bus schedule in order to
provide more buses at prime
time.

Negotiation Changes

Rejected by Faculty

by Tim Keeley

In recent months there have
been attempts to change negotiab-
ing conditions for the faculty of
the State University.

Currently the Civil Service
Employees Association, the
Faculty Association of the State
University of New York, and the
Empire State Federation of
Teachers have applied to the
State University Faculty Senate
for the right to represent the
faculty in collective negotiations
with the state.

Under the Taylor Act, passed
in I966, state employees were
given the right to collective ne-
gotiations with the state. All em~
ployees were included in this law
except professors at the State
University and state troopers,
because they already had means
of negotiating with the state.

The Statewide Faculty Senate
has asked each local branch of
the University to determine if
the faculty members prefer the

present arrangement of negotia-
tion, or whether they desire
collective negotiation with the
state under the Taylor Act.

The Faculty Senate at Albany
prefers the present arrangement
of negotiation between the State
University Senate and the Cen-
tral Office of the State Univer-
sity.

The current attitude of the
faculty towards selecting the
CSEA is unfavorable, although a
large portion are members of
the CSEA. Many have joined to
receive the favorable life insur-
ance policy offered in its pro-
gram.

In February, the Statewide Fac-
ulty Senate will convene and de-
termine how the faculty of the
entire State University system
feels towards changing negotia-
tion conditions. If a change is
decided upon, they must select
an organization to represent
them.

The new co-editors stated upon
their election, “We don't expect
to produce the same paper that
Sara has, but the ASP will lar-
gely remain the same.”

"We hope that an atmosphere
condusive to the expression of
all major viewpoints on the sun-
dry issues, which we too will
face, will exist. There will be an
enlargement in news and feature
coverage relating to the trends
and ideas in and out of the Uni-
versity Com m unity."

“The sports area of the news-
paper we feei, should be en-
larged to include more of the
freshmen's and women's
sports."

"Sara has brought the news
paper and the staff to a point
where it is beginning to look
like a university Paper. This
expansion we hope will continue
under us and our successors to
the time when an organized staff
can turn out, at_least several
copies of the ASP a week,"

CouncilAdopts New
StudentTax Policy

by Vi c Looper

Central Council, approved a
new Student Tax Policy andagain
acted on the question of budget-
ing of groups advocating a speci-
fic partisan political or religle
viewpoint at their Dec. 14 meet-

The Student Tax Policy, pass-
ed by a near unamious 24-0-2
vote, includes among its major
changes the provision that "the
student Tax card cannotbetrans-
ferred to or used by another stu-
dent." In order to purchase a
ticket or obtain a publication.
a student will have to show both
his ID and his Student Tax card.

Under this provision, students
purchasing tickets for dated
events with tax cards will have to
bring their dates with them to
pick up tickets. Buffalo alsouses
this type of system to encourage
people'to pay student tax.

Another section of the policy
states that when tickets are re-
quired for admission to an event
sponsored by a Student Associa-
tion organization then one ticket
will be issued per tax card. If
the chairman of the committee
consents upon the recommenda-
tion of the event chairman a
different ratio may be instituted
due to the nature of the event.

As in the old policy, student
membership, participation or
holding office and the right to
vote in elections or referendums
put to the students by the Student
Association is contingent upon the
payment of Student Tax.

Another provision in the
tax policy gives the chairman of
the Committee the power to dis-
tinguish whether a poll or
referendum affects the Student
Association or the student body
in general. If it affects the Stu-
dent Association then only mem-
bers will be able to vote.

It also indicates that whenever
a price is levied for an activity
the price shall at no time be the
same or lower than that charged
to Student Association members.

The new policy also gives the
Student Tax Committee the power
to exact various forms of penal-
ties on an Association organiza-
tion that the Committee hasjudg-

 

‘tions a

ed to be in violation of the Tax
Policy.

There are a number of viola-
group could make ea.
having non-Student Association
members in their organization,
not selling tickets to Association
members at lower prices, etc.

The penalties will depend on
the severity of the offense. One
of the penalties is freezing a,
budget. The group is then unable ‘
to get payment expenditures and
thus their activities would be
severely limited.

The Committee may alsoissue
an injunction, calling in and audit-
ing an organization's books,
which is a stronger penalty than
freezing a budget. They may ask
the Student Activities office to
refuse to give the group a table
in the Campus Center for selling
tickets, etc. Confiscation of a
publication and withdrawing ofan
organizations constitution or bud-
