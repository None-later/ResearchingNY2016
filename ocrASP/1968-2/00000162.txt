GARY PUCKE'IT AND THE UNION GAP will appear in concert with Judy Collins this Friday wt.

 union gap
In Concert Friday Night

“Music and poetry can produce
a catharsis that involves
everybody. That’s what I.m
after..." This, if Judy Collins has a
creed, would come close to
describing it. Judy Collins:
formerly labled a ‘folk singer',
now referred to as America’s
foremost singer of contemporary

art songs, and recently, an
important writer of songs
herself will appear at the

University this Friday nite along
with the Union Gap.

Her last two records
Wildﬂowers and In My Life have
ﬁrmly established her in the
foreground of popular music
interpreters. Her appearances at
college concerts have given her a
rare rapport with youth, that an
older generation refuses to--or
cannot-understand. She used to
represent “protest” yet has
continued to grow as a performer,
and more recently as a composer.
to the extent that her appearance
before an audience is described by
many not as just a performance,
but as a religious experience.

“At sixteen, i found that I
needed to be together more than i
needed to be alone. i found the
guitar, and then the only
discipline was my desire to get at
the communication through
lovely, beautiful songs.

Thus Judy Collins and guitar
drifted into the folk music scene,
casually, but inevitably. She
learned a great deal, then became
totally involved, and soon began
to attract attention--first in
Denver, then along the
Chicago-New York Cambridge
folk axis of the early '60‘s. She is
acclaimed particularly for her
singing of traditional
Anglo-American ballads.

Although the transition from
Judy Collins: Folksinger to Judy
Collins: interpreter of
Contemporary Songs is usually
dated from the release of the great
In My Life album in January
1967 , her involvament with
contemporary material began
much earlier. in the notes which
she wrote for her third album.
back in 1964 Judy explained

‘ But the music on this record,
although it is calyEd
‘follomusic' has grown mostly out
of the city, not the country.. if i
belong to any tradition at all, it is
the city tradition, one with its
roots iil urban life. i have chosen
to record on this album songs

written by people who are a pan
of this urban tradition as l
rim-1K)le of the city singers, if
you will. i know most of the
composer.:, and call some of them

my friends...”

But although the songs were
not traditional folk airs, the
content and feelin of the

material was indeed c user-to the?

rather naive Whitman-Guthrie
vision than to the truly
contemporary vision which these
same young poets, Dylan et al,
were to be the first to create.
Furthermore, the melodies were
folk-oriented as were the
arrangements and playing
techniques--hencr- the
continuation of the folk label. It
was, for the time being, as
accurate as anything else.

In My Life changed everything.
The album was hailed as a
milestone, an irrevocable break
with the past, a unique treatment
of unique matierial, a new
attitude towards contemporary
songs as works of art. Said Tom
Paxton of this album,"She has
gone outside the folk field and

found true music in other
idioms.“

The music she plays and sings
on her most recent

album,Wildﬂowers, is fragile,
lyrical, poetic. And along with the
songs of such gifted writers as
Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell,
and Jacques Brel, are the songs of
a new writer named Judy Collins.

Appearing with Judy will be
the Union Gap, composed of
General Gary Puckett, vocals,

guitar; Sergeant Dwight Bement,
tenor sax; Corporal Kerry Chater,
bass guitar; Private Gary
(“Mutha”) Withem, woodwinds,
piano; and Private Paul
Wheatbread, drums. The group
was» organized in San Diego,
California, in January, 1967, and.
named after the historic town of
Union Gap, Washington. Dressed
in Civil War uniforms, the group
attracted a large following as they
swept down from the North into
Southern California, playing clubs
and colleges.

Tickets for friday's concert are
on sale in the Campus Center.
Ticket prices are $1.50 with
student tax and $4.00 without.

Cinema Sponsored

By

The Cranes are Flying, a Soviet
film with Russian dialogutland
English subtitles, on Wednesday,
November 13. The ﬁlm, which
runs 94 minutes, will be shown at
7:30 pm. in the Assembly Room
of the Campus Center. There is no

The Cranes are Flying, which
'ﬁme Magazine he called “an
exciting experiena..a revelation
of the modern Russian mood." is
a romantic drama of two young
lovers caught up in the tragic
events of 1941-1945. This Cannes
prizewinner has been one of the
best received of the cultural
exchange films, not only because
its young lovers strike a universal
note, but also because its attitudes
and cinema style are v ery
revealing of contemporary Soviet
life.

The story surrounds Boris, a
doctor’s son who is very much in
love with Veronica; they are

happily ever after. But Boris
volunteers for war service in the
early days, Veronica's parents are
killed in an air raid, and she goes
to live with Boris' family. She is
seduced by Boris’ cousin, :1 young
musician, and though she doesn't
love him, she marries him.

The family is evacuated to
Siberia, and Veronica goes along,
wretched over her marriage and
yearning for Boris.For a long time
she cannot accept the fact that he
has been killed on the front. When
it is proven, she is able to free
herself from guilt and anguish
only by realizing that she must
build a new life on the ruins of
the old.

The Saturday Review has said,
“The Cranes are Flying has all the
attributes of a major Soviet
picture--extraordinarily fine
acting, an effective musical score,
and some interesting uses of the

camera.

Craig

A New Biography

Gordon Craig was a titan of the
British stage, a man whose
intensely personal vision has
provided a constant source of
inspiration and controversy for
almost a century. On November
19th Gordon Craig, Edward
Craig’s biography of his famous
father will be published. Upon its
recent publication in England, the
book was hailed, both by eminent
figures in the theatre and by
reviewers, as a superb chronicle.

Craig early abandoned a
promising career as an actor to

pursue his own visionary ideas of
a “new” theatre. His Moscow
production of Hamlet was a
milestone in imaginative stage
design, and his passionate
commitment to his unprecedented
coneptions stimulated a new
generation of young actors.
directors, and theatre people.
With uncommon candor, Gordon
Craig’s son and collaborator
provides a portrait of a distinctive
and improbable personality
--egoist, madman, genius.
