Aid Program

 

At Wisconsin

Madison, Wis.—(l.P.)—The
University of Wisconsin program
of assistance to disadvantaged
undergraduate students on this
campus has been cited as one of
the three “most outstanding"
among public institutions of
higher education in the United
States.

The Madison program of
tutorial and financial assistance
was described by the magazine,
Southern Education Report, as a
“significant contribution" to the
education of “high risk" students.
Projects at the University of
California and Southern Illinois
University also were among those
cited.

Launched in 1966 with 24
students, the program is directed
by Ruth Doyle, specialist in the
office of the dean of student
affairs.

“This is not a pilot project,
Mrs. Doyle said. ‘We're not an
experimental group. these kids

can make it. The big state
universities have more of an
obligation to help these

students—and can do it with less
trauma—than the private colleges.
This is part of our responsibility.”

'I‘utored by honor student
volunteers, the 24 were joined last
fall by another 63 students, all
rated in the bottom one per cent
on the University's "predicted
success scale.” This group
included 53 Negroes, four
American Indians, two Puerto
Ricans, and four whites.

Size of the program is restricted
by ‘ lack of money," the magazine
explained. ‘The University's
present intention is to continue
enrolling 60 to 66 new students in
the program each year. in a
ﬁve-year program, this will add up
to some 300 students."

area are again this year
participating in a series of
dialogues aimed at bringing them

0“ tentinterest.
These ‘ intercollegiate

Dialogues" are held once a month
at various college campuses, where
students discuss the issues in small

groups.

This month‘s dialogue will be
Sunday, November 17, at 2 p.m.
in Roger Bacon Hall at Siena
College. The topic will be “Sex on
Campus.”

Colleges which take part
include RP], SUNYA, Albany
College of Pharmacy, Siena,
College of St. Rose, Maria, Union.
St. Anthony’s on Hudson, Russell
Sage, and the Seminary of Our
Lady of Angels.

All the topics are selected by a

representatives of the various
colleges involved in the dialogue.
Topics are designed to keep
participants aware of today‘s ideas
and issues.

Demonstration Supports
Divinity Draft Resistor

Brooks Smith, a Latham
student at the University of
Chicago Divinity School, will
refuse induction into the US
Army at the Old Post Office
Building in Albany on Tuesday,
Nov. 19.

Refusal of illduction, which
could earn Smith up to five years
in prison, is tllc culmination of
almost a ycllr of resistance
activity, which began when he
hurncd his draft card last
December II.

He was also invoIVcd in the
planning for a ‘ resistance worship
service" at the University
Christian Movumcnt conference in
Cleveland last winter.

The Draft Colnmittcc of
Albany State's Students for 1
Democratic Society has called for
ll peaceful support demonstration
for Smith in frollt of the Post
Ofﬁce Building beginning at 8:30
'i‘ucsday morning.

He hopes by refusing induction,
to demonstrate his ‘conccrn for
thc‘dcmocrutlc and humanitarian
strands in our culture," as wall as
his opposition to “tho inequalities
of the draft system including the
question of conscription’s
legitimacy "

AllEN

Besides making plans for the
demonstration and Sunday
program supporting Smith, the
Nov. ll SDS Anti-Draft
Dommittce meeting decided to
postpone a large-scale draft
conference at least for the near
future. However, there are plans
for an event to initiate a program
for the training of draft
counselors to be held soon.

Production Of Napalm

Continued By Dow Co.

MIDLAND‘ Mich. (CPS)—-Dow
Chemical Corporation has elected
to take a moral stand on
napalm—they're going to stick
with it.

“You can debate the war, you
can talk about whether or not we
should be there," Dow's president
H. D. Doan said yesterday, "but
while our guys are there we feel
like giving them the weapons they
need, and believe me, they really
need this one."

Although Doan feels the
Vietnam War has “gotten
completely out of hand" and
favors an immediate troop
withdrawal, he also says that
napalm is “a fantastically useful
strategic weapon."

“There's only one tactical
weapon that can turn back the
human wave and that's napalm,”
he said. This liquid fire bomb is
the only way to seep death into
concrete bunkers and heavily
protected troop emplacements."

With napalm representing less
than one-half of one percent of
total Dow sales, the decision to
continue making the sticky and
My gasoline gel could be little
more than principle.

Dow is not forced by any
governmental pressures to
continue making napalm either.
Government contracts represent

less than five percent of total
sales.

According to Company
recruiters, response of Lop
students to Dow campus

interviews has not been affected,
despite the more tllan Illa
demonstrations in the last_vear,

Doan says the company feels a
"right and a responsibility to be
on campus for those students who
want to discuss job opportunities,
and we have always supported the
right of others to debate the
issues, to demonstrate peacefully,
and i hope we always will."

PARTICIPANTS IN PSYCO—DMA perform before an audience they thought they would be put of.

The event, sponsored by Cathexis, became a psycological exercise.

Audience Involvement Marks

Cathexis Psycho-Drama

by Barbara Heyne

Visualize a restaurant. A drllnk
accosts a college student.
Argumentation ensues. React.

This was the situation
presented by Cathexis, the
Psychology Club, in their
program, “The Role-Play, an
Experiment in Psycho-Drama,"
November 1 3.

Students were randomly
selected from the audience to
participate ill a situation of which
they had no previous knowledge.
Each participant was assigned a
role and was instructed to be alert
to the responses of others. The
succe of the enactment hinged
on th ability of the characters to
interreﬁt with one another, “to
come out of their bag."

As the incident in the
restaurant evolved, participants
interpreted the attitudes and
personalities evoked by such an
experience. Tile middle-aged
drunk reacts hostilely to a college

student who he thinks has
insulted his wife.
The wife tries to calm her

husband pleading with him not to
make a fool of himself. However,
when he is insulted she reverses
her reaction and jumps to his
defense. A mediator arises out of
the confusion. The manager
intervenes taking the side of the
drunk immediately.

As the role-play reachcs its
climax, the artificiality of tile
contrived situation gives way to
an understanding of the characters
point of view by each actor. The
student assuming the role of the

drunk understands the man‘s
reaction and the actor tunrs
against his own peer. Each

participant was able to lose
own identity and react to the

ORV Experiment

A bill proposed at the LAAC
meeting'Wednesday night by the
members of the Walden Council,
was killed. The Walden Council
was to meet Thursday night to
discuss what action, if any, was to
be taken by that body as a result
of the bill being rejected.

At the Thursday night Walden
Council meeting approximately
20 students showed up to discuss
what. to do about the defeated
bill.

The Council got rid of two
minor business issues immediately
and then took up the problem of
what to do about the Walden bill.

The main issues of the
discussion were whether to have a
two week experiment period
regarding Open Room Visitations
or to let each individual section
decide for itself.

After a long discussion it was
finally decided that each
illdividuul section in Waterbury
and Alden would decide for itself
the open room visitation policy it
wanted. The only stipulations
were that the sections must begin
the Visitations after the girls dorm
opens in the morning and end 15
minutes before girls curfew.

Also the longest period of time
that a section could schedule open
visitation on a single petition was
seven days.

In addition the Council decided
that it would do away with

 

by Alan Welnstock
was that a resident of the dorm
could keep his or her door closed,
but not locked while having a_
visitor in the room. This point was
barely discussed at the Walden
meeting Thursday night.

At a previous meeting Monday
night, approximately 1100 students
living in Waterbury and Alden
showed that they held an interest
in the bill proposed by Walden
Council to LAAC. These students,
and many of their fellow
Waterbury-Alden residents stated
that they were going to march on
the LAAC meeting Wednesday
night to show their support for
the bill.

Most of the students who had
said that they were going to show
up at the LAAC meeting did.
However a great majority of them
left before the Walden bill came
up for discussion.

Another point that was brought
up at the Monday meeting was
that some action was going to be
taken regarding the bill, whether

As part of the expansion of the
international aspect of Asian
studies, SUNY has afﬁliated itself
with Nanyang University, located
a few miles from the center of
Singapore.

Dr. John Slocum, Director of
International Education has
announced that the program will
start next year with the exchange
of 10 SUNY students and a junior
faculty member of the Chinese
university, who is presently
working toward his PhD.
Exchange students are requiried
to have studied at least 2
semesters of Chinese.

DeWitt Ellingwood, Associate
Professor of History is presently
taking a 1-year sabbatical leave at
Nanyang and will remain there

next year, as an exchange
professor.
SUNY is currently involved in a

cooperative arrangement with
Union College for the study of the
Chinese language. Professor
William Woo of Union is presently
teaching at both schools.

Selected students will start
their study in June with a cram
course in the language. Actual
classes will begin in
mid-September and will run
through August. A long vacation
period has been set aside for
travel.

During the past few months,
the Cabinet ministers of the
3-yearvold island republic have
repeatedly dwelt upon Singapore’s
chances for survival and
prosperity. Such extreme concern
was taken due to serious
economic and security problems
raised by Britain’s decision to
close her vast military installations
by 1971, and by the talk of an
American withdrawal from
Vietnam.

Singapore appears to be a
combination of the best of the
British and Chinese cultures. The
changes that lie in the immediate
future seem to reflect her past
history. During the last decade,
she has evolved from crown
colony (1946) to self-goveming
state (1959) to member of the
Malaysian Federation (1963) to
the independent republic (1965).

During the past few years, the‘

meeting republic has greatly expanded its
educational and cultural facilities.

THE TEACHERS’ DRAFT COUNSElING COMMITTEE

The Tcncllcrs' Draft Counseling Committee recognizes that many of our young men question
whether or not they can, as a matter of conscience, serve as soldiers ill the Vietnam War, and
further, that, under conditions imposed by the draft law, the choice of service, ltltenlate service, or
non-service represents, for many, a serious choice about life goals, and for others, a far reaclung
personal crisis. Tile Committee takes the position, therefore that as teachers and responSIble
members of the academic community, we must help such young men obtain infornlatioa on all
alternatives and examine tllcir own feelings to the end that they arrive at a rational alld
clllolionally satisfactory decision about their role, if any, in the Vietnam War.
