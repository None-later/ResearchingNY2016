[‘o the Editor:

As editor of the 1969 Torch I
would like to reply to the column
“The Greek Echo" which
appeared in the'ASP on November
1

The Editorial Board of the
Torch has decided not to include
composite pictures of the Greeks
in this year's book. Our reasons
for using group photographs are as
follows:

First, and primarily: thirty-four
pages of individual photos of
fraternity and sorority members is
too much when added to almost
one hundred pages of senior
portraits. We believe that row
after row. page after page of head
shots is monotonous and boring.
The university has grown too large
for anyone but graduates to have
the privilege of an individual
portrait; and even so, the
yearbook is having to devote more
and more of its space to this kind
of layout.

Second: We cannot be impartial
and still give the Greeks a
coverage far greater than that of
any other group. Fraternities and
sororities are indeed active in
s dent affairs, but their
membership is only a small
fraction of the total enrollment.
We can treat the Greeks only for
what they are, not for the
accomplishments of their
individual members. We are not a
publicity manual for the Greeks,
but a yearbook for the whole
university-~including that large

majority of students who prefer
to make their mark as
independents.

Third: We sincerely belieVe that
a group photograph of a fraternity
or sorority is far more interesting
to most students than rowa of
lookalike head shots. From an
imaginative group photo a
freshman wishing to rush can get a
far better idea of the special spirit

The Torch will co-operate with

and fully explained the position
contained in this letter. We asked
the members of Pan~Hellenic

with the Greek presidents if our
policy is still unclear. We will try
to give the Greeks the best phots
possible. allowing them enough

We plan to put names of all the

James D. Folte

RS, in reply to the advertisement
appearing in the ASP on
November 12:

In effect we charge all groups
for their photos when we ask for a
budget from Central Council. If
we billed the various organizations
separately, the money would still
be coming from the same place.
But the Greeks are independent
groups afﬁliated with Student
Association; Central Council has
no control over them, through
granting funds or otherwise. The
fraternities and sororities receive
no money from the student
treasury, and their members pay
student tax because as students

they now must pay it. Therefore

nistration has stated, particularly in

Student Guidelines, that ultimate responsibility

students. This will not be the case

until the ﬁnal decision of student affairs is the

ofthe students.

Reforms by the students may justiﬁably be
passed by Central Council and

immediately
Central Council, being the most
student body, should be allowed the
decide questions and proposals

concerning students. It does not have this power in
areas concerning residence reforms at this time.
Since the bill must now go to Faculty Student
Committee on Resdiences, we strongly urge that
this body recommend the bill in its original form
and that President Collins promptly submit these

University Council for their ﬁnal

approval.

 
 
   

we assess them $25 per page,
which is inexpensive compared
with our advertising rates.

To the Editor:

As a member of the University
community, I feel I must speak
out on the dangerous situation
which exists in the Dutch and
State Quad parking lots. This
situation is caused by certain
individuals who feel it is their
right to park their cars around the
curbs rather than in the lined
areas.

Owners of small cars account
for the majority of this privileged
group because their automobiles
ﬁt most conveniently into these
unsafe areas. There is certainly no
reason for the continuance of this
practice because authorities
should recognize this condition as
a threat to the safety of those
who use the parking lots.

Not only do these cars make it
difficult to turn at the end of a
row, but they also reduce a
driver’s visibility as he proceeds
into the lanes which aborder the
lot.

The trend now seems to be one
of parking medium—sized cars in
these areas which makes it even
more difficult to drive around
corners. This development,
coupled with the curb parking
along the sidewalk, has turned
spaciom two-lane roads into
narrow one-lane passages. Fire
apparatus would certainly find it
difficult, if not impossible, to get
through the parking lot.

Why should certain people be
allowed to park closer to the
podium just because they drive
small cars? Are the authorities
waiting for a serious accident to
occur before they take any
action? I doubt this, but let them
prove me correct by putting an
immediate and to this situation.

My entire electrical system had

some friends, with another car,
came to give me a push; and
started pushing me to a service

Checkpoint Charlie, one of the

bitchy yell, told me that my lights

We needed a change. and next

January we‘ll get one. Now that
the campaign is over. it‘s time to
step back and look at what has
happened.

There are three factors arising
from the election that might
affect the Nixon administration in
the next four years. All three are
being built up by some political

observers as nearly
insurmountable barriers to
progress in the new

administration.

The first of these problems is,
of course, the closeness of the
election itself. A 2/10 of one
percent victory in the popular
vote can hardly be considered a
mandate to govern. But the factor
that has to be taken into
consideration is the 13.5% of the
vote received by George Wallace.

Added to Nixon's total of
43.8%, the result is about 57% of
the people voting for a change.

The Greek Echo

lTrue, a small part of Wallace's
isupport would not have gone to
Nixon, but the fact remains that
in voting for Wallace they were
demanding a change. and by the
very nature of their third party
protest vote, demanding it more
emphatically than the Nixon
supporters.

The second predicted
roadblock for President Nixon is
the I‘ ‘ " ’
Congress. The point here is that
party disipline, especially in the
party out of power. is almost
non—existant. The Democrats do
control Congress, but many of
these are conservative Southerners
who will probably cross party
lines to support Nixon legislation.

It should also be remembered
that Southerners either chair or
control many important
committees in Congress. During
the next four years, 1 think we
can look for a coalition of

Republicans and Southern
Democrats to give Nixon a
responsive Congress.

Finally, we have the matter of
political debts. Who does Mr.
Nixon owe? There are some who
say he is indebted to Strom
'I‘hurmond and others of his
persuasion. In my opinion, the
choice of Mr. Agnew as the
Vice-Presidentialjcan didate would
be ' enough to hold the
south for a long. long time.

Indeed, it. is the south who
should owe Mr. Nixon for giving
them a conservative alternative to
a man who probably would have
been the most expensive president
in history (in more ways than
one). As for Rocky. Javits,
Goodell. Lindsay, etc., they did
nothing to help in the campaign
and obviously cannot expect
anything in return.

In fact, I'd say Sen.’l. Javits and
Goodell were the two major
reasons why Humphrey carried
New York. Nixon owes the
liberals nothing, and here's one
person who hopes he gives them
just that in regard to positions in
the new administration.

On second thought. if we need
new ambassadors to outer Borneo.
or some such area, I can think of
no better place for these four
gentlemen. Surely the taxpayers
of New York would be eternally
grateful.

I can see no reason why
President Nixon should not take
the initiative and provide America
with strong decisive leadership.
