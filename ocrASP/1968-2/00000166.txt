I don’t frequently write about
recording artists, in fact I've done
so only once, but because of the
great pleasure with which I have
received Judy Collin’s albums I
have decided to devote a column
that will normally concern itself
only with drama to her artistic
talents.

Miss Collins began as a simple
folk-singer, much in the manner
of Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, and
Donovan, to whom I , will
frequently compare her in this
article. Her repertoire was
dominated by traditional
Anglo-American ballads. of
varying quality, but all sung with
a terribly fine voice, of fairly high

What strikes one immediately
about Jerzy Skolimowsky’s "Le
Depart" (Ceinema Art Theatre) is
its sense of restless, propulsive
energy. From the first shot~of a
turtleneck sweater yanked down
over his head—Jesn-Pierre Leaud
scarcely pauses as he drives,
sprints, skips, fistfights, leapfrogs,
and handsprings through Brussels
in search of a Porsche 611s to
enter in a sports car rally, and his
hurtling, reckless resourcefulness
is a delight to watch.

“In Poland," Skolimowsky has
remarked, “possession of a car is a
distinctive mark of property."
“Le Depart," while superficially
about Leaud’s passion for racing
and his awakening affection for a
girl (tartly played by Catherine
Dumont), is really about mass
advertising, elegant wigs, fancy
cars, bathing suits, gas
pumps—that is, contemporary
values and the glittering gadgetry
that surrounds them.

Here an auto show is a masscult
display case, where people come
to gaVNk at the gleaming tactile
machines. A noisy argument over
an accident takes place before
huge auto posters from which ad
people grin blankly.
Skolimowsky's use of pop culture
to extablish a milieu and mood
and to comment on the

foreground action indebts him to
Godard; but I’m afraid his
fragmentation is more mechanical,
his milieu emptier of background
than that of his French model.

If Skolimowsky is derivative, he
has gifts too. His comic sense
knows how to make Leaud’s
attempts to steal a Porsche both
humorous and elegant cinema.
Now and then, side riffs—like a
closeup of a hotdog thrust up an
exhaust pipe—and minor
characters—a snooty dame on the
make, a mufflered
pawnbroker—reveal that this
director doesn't overlook the little
details that can make a film a
chain of pleasantly unexpected
explosions. (Godard uses Molotov
cocktails, while Skolimowsky,
more gentle and less
revolutionary, favors nickel
firecrackers.) Finicky
compositions, a calculated
rhythmic abruptness, long
sequences kept tactfully
silent—here Skilimowsky's impact
is strong.

I especially liked the scene in
which a cutaway display car
rotates, its hinged halves regularly
parting and meeting, and Leaud
and Catherine, each sitting in a
side, discover their growing love as
the slowly swinging segments
finally, gently, meet.

Art Gallery Presents
Two New Exhibitions

Two new exhibitions are
scheduled to open at the SUNY
Art Gallery on November 25th.
Collages and "projections" by
Romare Bearden will be shown on
the Gallery's ﬁrst ﬂoor. Mr.
Bearden’s powerful Expressionist
images are created from
newspaper and magazine
photographs, and scraps of fabric,
paper ,and paint.

The Projections originate as
collage but in the final state are
photoenlargemenls of the original
piece. The artist's subject matter
ranges from his intensely personal
view of Negro life in the southern
countryside and in Harlem to
interpretations of events from

classical mythology and
contemporary life.
Romare Bearden was born

in North Carolina and educated in
New York where he now IIVes. He
exhibits regularly at
Cordier-Ekstrom Gallery and has
recently made covers for Fortune
and Time magazines.

The paintings of Donald Cole
who also lives in New York will be
shown on the Gallery’s first floor.
Mr. Cole graduated from Buckneil
University in 1963 with a degree
in Civil Engineering. He worked as
a civil engineer until 1959 when
he returned to school to study for

Hummus“. u.»  .

an MFA degree at the University
of Iowa. Mr. Cole now teaches at
the New York Institute of
Technology. His large abstract
canvases reﬂect an interest in
relating the forms and
mathematical relationships of
technology to the plastic and
coloristic concerns of painting.

A reception for Donald Cole
and Romare Bearden will be held
in the Art Gallery at 7 :30 pm. on
November 25th. The public is
invited.

Skolimowsky only loses cohﬁol‘ih
the pacing of those interminable
driving sequences which should
serve merely as connective tissue
but instead stick out as unsightly
lumps of fat.

The ending is quietly_satisfying.
Leaud and Catherine finally steal
a Porsche. While they're, holed up:
in a hotel the night before the
rally, she shows him slides of her
childhood. Befdre he'd wanted
nothing more than to win the
race, butx'now as she dozes over
the projector, he looks at her
tenderly for the ﬁrst time. The
next morning she awakes to the
sound of motors whining outside.
But Leaud is in the room with
her.. He overslept? No. She smiles,
andwhen he looks at the bed,
she's undressed and waiting for
him. Closeup of him, and the shot
begins to melt as slide had.

Superficial, sure, like so much
of Skoliuowsky's film, but also
assured and affecting. “Le
Depart” makes one vigilant for
more from this talean young
director.

‘We

Gains

Judging by his enthusiastic
reception from the critics, Joseph
Heller, whose “Catch-22" has
become an anti-war classic, has
made a most auspicious debut as a
playwright with “We Bombed in
New Haven," his ﬁrst play.

Now settled at thci Ambassador
Theatre on West 49th Street in
New York City, this powerful and
provocative anti-war
comedy-drama stars Jason
Hobards and Diana Sands. Called
by Richard Watts of the New
York Post “The first really
satisfactory new American play of
the season," "We Bombed in New
Haven” again demonstrates as did
“Catch-22,” Heller's great gift for
adopting wild farcical humor to a
serious anti-war purpose.

Living

After four years of exile, the
Living Theatre has returned to
New York to create on the stage

of the Brooklyn Academy of
Music a mute and terrifying
monster.

Julian Beck and his wife, Judith
Malina, founded the Living
Theatre in 1951. Sets were built
of string, rags and scrap lumber.

“We were broke after our
second production," admits Beck.
Each new theatre was sucessively
closed by fire regulations and
accumulated debts.

No large foundation would
support them because Beck could
not afford to pay his actors
Equity rates. The Ford
Foundation said if Beck could not
finance professionalism, they
would not finance Beck.

Finally, in October 1963, the
Internal Revenue Service entered
the theatre and declared that the
building was seized. The Becks
had not been able to afford
income tax.

In 1964, the group went to
Europe.|-‘or four years the Living
Theatre, renamed ‘le Living,‘
toured the continent, drawing
alternate applause and attack.

The disciples of Artaud saw
them as ultimate actors - that is,
sacrificial victims, immolating
themselves by their art. They were
ejected from the Avignon Festival.
They became a legend fabricated
by u waiter of press dispatches,
riots and “scandales.”

The Living Theatre returned to
New York on guarantee of a
round trip ticket and opened with
Paradise Now. The climax of the
play occurs when actors and
audience troop out into the
streets. The people loved it. The
police descended, and the Bucks

exposure.

performance. But the show went
on. Outside the theatre 300
members of Students for a
Democratic Society protested,
demanding to be let in. So the
Becks agreed to give an extra
performance. Most of the SDS
delegation sneaked in through the
stage door anyway, condemning
the Living Theatre for not
breaking the regulations of the
system.

But the Living Theatre breaks
the system itself. Frankenstein,

victims. Our society has created
these people who lift the massive
limbs of Frankensteing toward the
audience. They frighten us; they
are thin and muscular, young and
hard. They have lost their
innocence, and they remind us
that we too have lost what
innocence we possessed-and
replaced it with a lie. They want
to form us in their image, and we,
in turn, demand that they rebuild
themselves.

Frankenstein is not a play. The
dramatic confrontation is between
the audience and the actors. It is a
silent battle and it lives.



Pun?

 

Productions Grow

by Holly Salt:

Started as an attempt to
provide a break from the books,
State Quad Productions has now

developed into more of an
entertainment corporation
according to Frank Levy,

Producer-Director of the Council.

The staff will celebrate the first
anniversary of the founding of the
SQ? Saturday, November 16, with
a party at the Ambassador
Restaurant. The Quad will be
treated to “Fantastic Voyage” on
the new cineamascope wide
screen.

Following the film will be a
double feature. The two films are
being shown for the price of one.
“Hud” and “Cincinnati Kid” will
be seen November 22 and 23.

The purpose of the Council was
originally to provide
entertainment for the Quad. But
interest has developed to such an
extent that Levy estimates 3,000
students have been turned away
from the Tower East Cinema.

This great demand for seats has
lead to the institution of the
reserve seat policy for cinema
weekends, the first of which was
November 8-10 which featured
“Judgment at Nursmberg.‘ The
next weekend will he December
13-14. Featured will be “The
Longest Day" on Friday and "A
Man for All Seasons."

The first Sunday of each month
will be the Quad’s free film
program. It presents old films,
which may have been on

Trio Lacks Unity;

Individuals Impressive

by Paula Camerdells

The concert given by the
American String ’I‘rio must remain
in the shadow of the Philadelphia
Wind Quintet, which had
appeared here at the University
last week. Although the individual
players, notably Karen ’i‘uttle and
John Gobermun, showed precise
sensitivity, the group as a whole
neither gave the impression of
confidential unity nor of
convincing control.

The setting for the concert was
qu‘tu appropriately the Art
Gallery (which is presenting it This
exhibition). The ﬁrst two pieces,
by Schubert and Miirtlnu went
fairly well, The Madrigiils for
violin and viola were interesting

w i lil interest ing chord
combinations and contrasting
runs.

Miss 'l'utllc‘s sensitivity to the
pathos of the music made her

sound as if she was playinga harp
instead of a viola at times.

By the time the Mozart piece
had ended the program was
dragging a bit.

The group entirely redeemed
itself with the Beethoven Trio in
D Major. With this selection, they
really came to life—they played.
This was the gem of the evening.
Miss Tuttle, indeed the demur,
self-assured, accurate musician, is
most attractive to watch because
she works quietly, yet supurbly.

Goberman, the cellist, stole the
show in his own quiet way by
mastering the techniques and
dynamics of the music so well,
always bringing our the richest
tones. Every tiny movement was
measured and controlled in
contrast to a somewhat distracting
freedom of movement of the
violinist.

Contrasting the serious mood
of the concert was a curious
incident. During the intermission,

films are restricted to Quad
residents.

The SQP is planning the
publication of the State Quad
informer, a weekly newspaper.
Edited by Jeff Sandquist it will
include Quad news, editorials, and
reviews.

As a service project for the
community the State Quad
Productions is planning a
Christmas party for orphans of
the Albany area orphanages.

The money obtained from the
motion picture "King of Kings"
will be used to buy gifts for the

children. The staff of the SQP will
entertain the children all day
December 15.

Trying to provide some comic
relief from the pressure of the
final week of the semester the
Quad will present the Marx
Brothers in “Room Service" and
W.C. Fields in “Barbershop.”
These films will be shown on a
staggered schedule to permit
students to attend when their
study schedule permits.

The Production Council has
originated a State Quad honor roll
and humanitarian award. The ﬁrst
named to the honor roll were
David Black, producer of “Geofﬂe
M' and Joel Grey, the leading

man.

The first recipient of the
humanitarian award will be Miss
Pearl Bailey, a long time
entertainer. it is hoped that the
award will be presented during the
Quad ’s special spring weekend.

March 7-9 has been designated
as State Quad Weekend. The
humanitarian award will hopefully
be presented then. The
production of “On A Clear Day
You Can See Forever" will be
presented along with sporting
events, a possible special dinner,
and entertainment by a famous
celebrity.

Auditions for "On A Clear
Day” are in progress.
