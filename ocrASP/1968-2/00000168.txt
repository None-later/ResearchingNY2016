Ginsburg 8
Poetry

Poses Question
by Daryl Lynne Wager

The ballroom of the Campus
Center was filled to capacity last
night as students gathered for a
poetry reading by Allen Ginsburg.
Those unable to find seats sat on
the floor around the lecturn and
lined the walls to hear the bearded
poet.

Ginsburg, who is this year's
first major speaker sponsored by
the Forum of Politics, ,was clad in
a dark green shirt, jeans and short
boots. He opened his program
with the chanting of “Hare
Krishna."

The first poem read by
Ginsburg was thirty minutes in
length. “I hadn’t read that long
poem before an audience before,"
said Ginsburg. The poem, which
stated, “America will be refused
eternity by her own mad son, the
bomb," touched on such popular
Ginsburg themes as censorship,
social injustice, corruption and
“the secret police.”

Two shorter selections, “I’m a
Telephone," and “This Form of
Life Needs Sex" followed. The
latter drew mixed reactions from
the attentive spectators; many
found Ginsburg's profusion of
Obscenities offensive.

After the reading of “King of
May," and a poem which he said
was written in the fifth hour of an
LSD trip, Ginsburg announced
that there would be a short
intermission, during which he
spoke informally with students.
Ginsburg finds college audiences
particularly receptive: “I guess
everybody must be stoned
because they’re paying clear
attention,” he said.

Ginsburg does not insist that
his audience understand his

Thorne Discusses LAAC Bill,

Gives Personal Opinion

by Tim Keelev

Dr. Clifton C. Thorne, Vice
President for Student Affairs,
presided at The President‘s
Conference with Students
yesterday.

Thorne gave his personal
opinions on the current I..AAC
resident bill and discussed
pre-registration that began this
week. _

The final legal decision on the
LAAC bill rests with the
University Council Thorne noted.

“I have tried to anticipate what
the Council might do," remarked
Tliorne. “I personally raise three
points that they may ask."

The first point Thorne raised
was that of an individual's choice
concerning hours of open room
visitation. “I feel that the
possibility of choice does not
exist with this proposal."

Thorne cited residence halls at
the University of Rochester that
have either 24 hour open house,
no open house, or occasional open
house. “Here the student has a
choice of residence."

HThose presenting this proposal
have forgotten one important part
of staff work. What are the
students likely to decide?"
Thorne commented as his second
point. He suggested that a pilot
study should have been run.

Thorne‘s final point was one of
accountability. “The passage of
this bill would require a
completely new method of
administration. The method was
not presented with the bill.‘I

Vic Looper, chairman of
LAAC, was present to defend the
proposal. Looper contended that
many of Thorne's questions had

Undergrad Report Implemented
To Improve Academic Growth

problem for these groups will be
finding how the transition from
small to large university can he

The task forces each consist ot
ten members of which there are
seven faculty and three students.
The faculty members were chosen
by President Collins while the
students were appointed by
Central Council.

The committees have been
meeting regularly for several
weeks, but are still in the
organizational stage. It is hoped
that their implementations will be
published before the spring
semester begins. It will take

considerable time before the
recommendations are put into
effect.

Through the recommendations
of Dean Pcrlmutter and the
implementations of the task
forces, the mechanism r change

the University to twice its present
size by 1975.

The findings of the committees
will go through Miwa’s office, and
then will be acted upon by the
President’s office and the
University councils.

The Task force on the

Professor W liam Reese, It will

Thorns raised, he assured students

Smith Resists Draft
Explains Reasoning

by Barbara Heyne

“It’s been a long time since I've
spoken to a favorable audience,"
began draft resister Brooks Smith,
addressing a meeting of the SDS
Anti‘Draft Committee, November
17.

He made it clear to the
Anti»Draft group that his
resistance is not of the “we won't
go“ type. He and an estimated
3500 others are resisting on the
grounds that the draft system is
wrong.

Tuesday morning. Smith, a
Liltliam student at the University
of Chicago Divinity Scho I,
refused induction into the I’ ‘.
army at the Albany Federal
Building. Students from the

University and other area colleges

have been demonstrating in front
of the Federal Building since 8:30
a.m. in support of Smith.

The divinity student took his
position against the draft after
realizing that “the ideals of
American democracy were a lie."
Citing incidents such as Mississippi
in 1964, he stated, “I believe in
theses ideals, but you run up
against incidents in which these
ideals are trampled upon."

In his travels Smith
encountered people “who didn't
want to talk or hear about the
war. They didn't want to hear
that these fine American ideals,
which Ilo (‘hi Minli .iw fit to
include in his constitution, were
