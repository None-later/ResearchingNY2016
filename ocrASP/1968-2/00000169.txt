NY Strike Ends With Vote
0f Teachers Monday Night

NEW YORK (UPI)—Striking
public school teachers voted
overwhelmingly Monday to ac-
cept an agreement ending a 10-
week—long dispute which kept
most of the city’s 900 schools
closed.

Some teachers returned to the
classrooms immediately and all
schools were expected to be
open Tuesday.

They accepted the agreement
by a vote of 17,658 to 2,738.
Although less than half the
United Federation of Teachers
(UFT) membership voted, it
was the largest turnout in the
union‘s history.

Marathon Session
The settlement was worked
out during the weekend in a
marathon bargaining session at
Mayor John V. Lindsay’s home.

Lindsay admitted none of the
parties was completely satisfied
with the settlement which
included suspension of the local
Ocean Hill-Brownsville
ing board in Brooklyn.

The Puerto Rican community
was reportedly angered because
one of the three Ocean Hill-
Brownsville principals suspend-
ed as part of the settlement was
Louis Fuentes, the only Puerto
Rican principal in the city.

Longer Sessions

So far this semester, most of
the city’s 1.1 million public
school students have had only 11
days of instruction. They will
have to go to school longer each
day and attend classes on 10
holidays to make up the time,
but there will be no compulsory
summer classes next year.
Teachers will lose only six

Snith Refuses Induction

Discusses Draft Experiences

continued from page 1

The turning point in Smith’s
attitude toward the draft resulted
from the October marches on the
Pentagon. As he saw the
destruction caused by the police
and felt its implications about
American democracy, Smith knew
“it was a question of whether I
believe in living by the values I
spouted or refusing to serve and
saving my integrity." Brooks
admitted that it “was not a fully
rational decision, but one made
on rational grounds."

As a theology student, Smith
could have received a 4D
classification exempting him from
active duty. He could have applied
for a Coilsciencious Objector
classification also. However, he
believes “this is like accepting a
ll“ classification which implies
that drafting is a legitimate

institution."

“My quarrel is not with
classifcation, but with the foreign
policy of the U.S. The draft is
critical if the U.S. is to play world
policeman. Pencetime
conscription is necessary so that
America can fight brushfirr wars
in support of pro-American
dictators, This is a part of the free
world we learn about in high
school."

Smith faces a prison sentence
of two to five years, and a
possible fine of $l0,tJ(J0. He
admitted to the audience that the
plospOCL of going to jilll "was

Major Cause 0 f Protest
By Students Is Vietnam

A recent survey of more than
800 deans at the nation's colleges
shows that Vietnam was the major
cause of organized protest by
college student during the
1967-68 academic year.

Dormitory rules, Civil Rights,
and student participation in
college government were, in that
order, the next most frequently
protested issues on the nation‘s
campuses, according to the survey
by the Educational Testing
Service.

The ETS report also notes that
organized groups demonstrating
against most issues rarely made up
more than ten percent of a college
student body. Protesters against
U.S. Government policy in
Vietnam, for example, averaged
about five percent of their
respective student bodies,
according to the deans’ estimates.
Protests not organized in advance
were not included in the findings.

ETS‘s questionnaire survey was
completed by deans of students in
860 accredited four—year colleges
and univerisities. Each dean was
asked to note the extent of
organized student protest over 27
educational, social, and political
issues during the 1967-68
academic year.

38 percent of the deans
reported Vietnam demonstrations
on their campuses last year. 34
percent reported protest over
dormitory regulations, and 29
percent over local, off-campus
Civil Rights matters.

Protests over greater student
participation in campus
policy—making was reported at 27
percent of the colleges. In one out
of four colleges there were
protests about the draft and about
the presence ofmilitary recruiters.
One out of five colleges noted
demonstrations over governmental
agency and industrial recruiters on
campus.

In a survey in 1965, a similar

group of deans was asked to

provide the same information
about many of the same issue. At
the time, they reported that Civil
Rights was the most frequent
cause for student activis .Campus
food ranked second, and Vietnam
third. Vietnam, then, was cited by
one out of five colleges as a cause
of organized protest, compared to
almost two out of five today.

A comparison of the results of
both studies indicates that since
1965 three particular issues have
triggered protests with increasing
frequency. Organized discontent
with dormitory rules was
registered at 34 percent of the
colleges, as compared to 28
percent in 1965. Student demands
for a larger role in campus
governance increased from 19 to
27 percent. This past year racial
matters, expecially demands for
studies of black culture,
accounted for demonstrations in
18 percent of the schools. Three
years ago, five percent of thr

This picture of student
protests, only partly accurate in
itself (since it was compiled by
deans of students and did not
include spontaneous protests), is
likely to change radically this
year.

A prediction in August by
Brandeis University's Center for
the Study of Violence already
seems to be coming ture: that
there would be more protests than
ever in both colleges and high
schools, and that large numbers of
them would be race—oriented in

Volunteers Needed
For VITA Program

by Gale McAllister

The Volunteers for
International Technical
Assistance, VITA, will hold their
fall conference on Saturday,
November 23 at Union College in
Schenectady.

University students and faculty
members are urged to attend this
conference which will discuss how
they can participate in VITA.

VITA is an organization made
up of teachers, engineers,
businessmen, students, and people
from virtually all occupational
fields who “offer their spare time
for consultation on problems
from the developing nations."

Most of VITA’s work is done
through the mail. Missionaries,
Peace Corps members, and the
people of the underdeveloped

countries themselves, write to
V I TA for answers to their
questions.

Questions range from problems
with rusting typewriters to the
best and most economical way to
build a bridge or irrigation system.

Unlike the Peace Corps or
VISTA, VITA provides the
opportunity for the student to
help the underprivileged of the
world, now.

Students can now, if they are
willing, devote some of their spare
time to help handle the
tremendous amount of mail that
VITA receives each week. There is
something important for every
student and faculty member to

Conference
History

Lannie likened present
attempts by Blacks to decentralize
schools to the rise of Catholic
Schools. Saying that the
imposition of the Protestant Bible
and the fear of ‘Popery’ in public
education forced Catholics to
construct Parochial Schools.

Mr. David Secley, of
Metropolitan Applied Research
Center, offered a pessimistic view
of the effectiveness of school
desegregation.

He cited low reading scores of
many urban youth as being caused
by increased segregation due to
the flux of whites to suburban
and parochial schools.

poetry, but he would like them to
listen to his words and their pulse.
Watching Ginsburg as he reads is
as vital to his poetry as is
listening; his gestures and bodily
movements help one to find
meaning in his words.

The second part of the program
featured a talk by Brooks Smith, a
draft resistor from the Divinity
School of the University of
Chicago who will refuse induction
today for the second time. Smith
received a standing ovation.

do.

Faculty members can help solve
the problems and students can get
a real chance to help by doing
follow-up work which entails
finding out if the answer given the
people solved their problem.

A sign-up sheet will be in the
Campus Center all this week.
Transportation to and from Union
College will be provided if enough
students sign up.

Professor Edward Reilly,
Manager of the Computer Center,
and Professor James Corbett of
the Physics Department, both
from the University, will speak at
the conference.

All students and faculty
members who are at all interested
in VITA are invited to attend the
conference, and find out more
about the work VITA has done in
helping the people in the
developing nations of the world.

The conference will last from
10:00 am. to 4 :45 pm. Saturday,
November 23, and there will be
no expenses except the cost of
lunch.

Diana Ross
Tearfully Pleas
For Equality

LONDON UPI-Britain’s royal
family abandoned its traditional
public reserve Monday, and wildly
applauded American Negro singer
Diana Ross when she interrupted
a royal variety performance to
plea tearfully for racial harmony.

The slim dusky singer from
Detroit had just finished an
emotional rendering of the song
“There’s A Place For Us" from
WEST SIDE STORY with her pop
group The Supremes.

As the music faded, Miss Ross
walked to the front of the stage of
the packed London Palladium,
grabbed a microphone and with
her voice crackling with emotion,
said:

“There‘s a place for us. A place
for all of us. Black and white, Jew
and Gentile, Catholic and
Protestant. So was the world of
slain civil rights leader Martin
Luther King and his ideal. If we
keep this in mind, thenwe can
carry on his work."

There was stunned silence as
Miss Ross, with tears running
down her cheeks, broke into the
opening lines again of “There’s A
Place For Us."

A storm of applause erupted
from the royal box and the rest of

the audience and lasted two
minutes.
Lord Snowdon, Princess

Margaret's husband, leaned over
the side of the flower-decked box,
clapping lustily. QUEEN
Elizabeth and her husband Prince
Philip were on a South American
tour, but the queen mother was in
the box as was Prince Charles,
Princess Anne, Margaret and other
members of the royal family.
