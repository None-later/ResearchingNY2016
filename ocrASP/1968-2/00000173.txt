Robert F. Kennedy on the steps
of the Capital Building in Albany,

Kennedy's birthday in a solemn
manner.

The gathering contained
members of the Albany Citizens
for Kennedy along with various
other onlookers and University
students dispersed throughout.
The order of service consisted of
short speeches from local clergy
and University members.

Rabbi Bloom from Beth Emeth
Temple opened the service with
excerpts from the Bible. M. J.

f Obscene ‘Peter Pan’ Play

Closed At Wisconsin Univ.

MADISON, Wis.
(CPS)--Hearlngs will begin next
week on charges of obscenity
against a play director and dancer
who performed an original “Peter
Pan" on the University of
Wisconsin campus. ,

But according to the director,
Stuart Gordon, the charges may
be dismissed, and legal action is at
a temporary standstill.

Gordon, who has presented.

several other plays at the
Univers‘tiy, is charged with
obscenityt because of the
appearance of nude dancers in his
adaptation of J.M. Barrie's classic.
Carolyn Purdy, who allegedly
appeared nude in one sequence, is

their freedoms for them.

The Faculty-Student
Committee on Residences has also
expressed great concern about the
protection of the rights of the
minority.

For instance, there may be
some students who do not wish to
conform to the majority decision
on Open House policy. Again, the
Committee feels more definition
is necessary.

Cohen feels no further
definition is necessary. “The bill is
trying to do what is best for ALL
the students—not just the
majority. The bill tries to present
the broadest possible sphere in
which the students may make
those decisions which affect their
lives."

At the same time, University
residence staff "has been trying to
build a society of open
communication. This establishes a
high level of trust and
responsibility, and enables
students to work out resdience
problems at the root of the
problem, among themselves,"

Monday, November 25, there
will be an emergency meeting of
the Faculty-Student Committee at
5:30 pm. to further consider the

The bill originated in
LAAC’s Committee On Residence

Course In Black History

Designed

by Kevin McGlrr

“Abraham Lincoln freed the
Black man from slavery,’[ a
statement that one might elicit
from any child and most adults, is
actually quite far from the truth.
Mr. Jerome Dukes, who teaches
the Black History courses at the
Urban Center, 80 Central Avenue,
feels that ‘Reconstruction' has
been the most distorted period of
history.

The conceptualization of
President Lincoln as being the
Great Emancipator was actually
not the reality for most Blacks
after the war. Only because the
Union Army was failing did
Lincoln allow Blacks to fight for
their own freedom After the war
only veterans and ‘very intelligent
Negrocs' were allowed to vote.

Ignotance of peoples whom
you have learned to mistrust will
reinforce misunderstanding and
hatred; such is the philosophy of
Dukes. He feels that the
introduction of Black history into
early childhood curriculum will be
a necessity for racial harmony in
the future.

tie also feels that it should be
assimilated into the rcgular schools
curriculum and not as a single
course which is being done
presently. 'l‘o Dukcs‘ knowledge,
there has been no wide-scale
attempt to bring this subject
matter into the schools.

Dukes feels that it is not
enough that only historical fact be
taught, but it is also important
that Black Arts be introduced.

member of the staff and professor
at Rockefeller University since

Also scheduled to take pttrt in
the symposium Is Dr. Eric It.
Kandol whose topic will be
"Principles of Organization of a
Simple Nervous System."

To End Igno

Dukes is having his class read a
number of Black novelists and
poets. He is trying to create a
dialogue amongst class members
and thus far Dukes has noticed a
number of attitude changes.

Dukes feels very strongly that
sensitization of the oppression of
Black people by White people is
tantamount to minimizing racial
conflict.

There are approximately
twenty people in the class, with
the majority being Whites. Dukes
is happy to see that the class is
comprised of people from both
academic and non-academic
backgrounds. At present the
course is taught for non-credit,
but the University is presently
evaluating it for credit basis. The

rance

course is taught for a semester and
will be offered in the Spring.

Dukes has formerly taught at
Howard and Southern Universities
and is at present teaching at Mt.

Schenectedy.

lTorum D' cusses

Mid-East

by Karen Overhaugh

A group of twenty people
gathered at 3:30 on Thursday
afternoon in HU 137 to hear Dr.
Pettengill of the economic
department deliver a lecture on
“The Middle East Today." He
began by giving a “general
overview" from the economist’s
point of view.

The audience was surprised to
learn that the per capita income
of the Middle East, which Dr.
Pettengill defined to include
Western Asia and Egypt is
approximately one-twentieth of
that of the United States.

He attributed this fact to lack
of resources such as coal and iron
ore, lack of skilled labor and
entrepreneurs, and a climate not
conducive to agriculture with the
rainfall amounting to about
one-half of that of the United
States.

Nevertheless, he stressed the
importance of their one major
resource, that is, the Middle East

conomy

of the world 's oil out put.

The points of the lecture were
:learly emphasized and followed
one another logically as Dr.
Pettengill began to discuss hope
for future economic
Improvements in the Middle East.
He pointed out that their own
goal was to increase their per
:apita income by four to five
percent yearly. With a touch of
humor, he added that “the stark
is their major liability,” that is, a
population increase “diminishes
the additional returns" that come
with economic progress.

The lecture came to an end
with a realistic, yet optimistic
tone, and it proved to be very
interesting and informative, even
to those in the audience that
knew little about the subject. This
can be attributed to Dr.
Pettengiil’s thorough background
of the topic, since he lived for two
years in the area, and his great
enthusiasm for economic
developments in the Middle East.

Fraternity Man
Of The Month

Weeks of planning, committee
work, and interviews culminated
Wednesday night as the
lntcrl'rttlcrnily Council presented

the first “Fraternity
Man-oI'-i.ht-~thth" award to
David L. Anderson (AI’A),

October‘s recipient.

This award, the first of its kind,
is designed to give recognition to
the l'ruiernity man who has shown
outstanding achicVements in the
fields of leadership and
scholarship, as well as overall
contributions to the University,
the community, the fraternal
movement, and his own
fraternity.

“Sparky” by his fraternity
brothers, is a Senior Marketing

step forward and sign his name.

Having thus broken Selective
Service law, he now stands trial
with the possibility of twa to five
years in prison and up to $10,000
fine.

Outside of the Albany Federal
Building on State Street and
Broadway, nearly a hundred
people picketed and held a kind
of “folk worship" service in
support of Smith. Under the
bright fog at 8:30 am. a half
dozen people, some wearing
various buttons, were walking
back and forth in front of the
Federal Building. There was not
really a demonstration yet.
Quickly, however, the picket line
grew and cardboard and magic
markers arrived.

Signs were made and given to
the supporters, including slogans
like “Not with my life you
won't," and "Thou shalt not kill,
Ex. 20:] Zl--it really metros it," and
“Smith (lid it-now it ’s your turn."

At about 5):”), Smith had
arrived and the informal worship
begun, complete with a thirteen
star American flag and
impressionistic drawings of peace
by some second graders. “Down
by the Riverside," with fok guitar

accompaniment was sting. A
couple of students rcad Bible
Vl‘l'Sl'h’.

Smith made a ltrief statement

about his decision to refuse
induction and about his liklihood
of being in prison within six
months. linding with the now
lradilion “Peace,” he received
warm applause and the raismg of
many supporters' hands in the
symbol of victory. lie then turned
and went inside with u chupnn
from his campus, who later
explained what Smith would do
inside,

Next followed what was called
an “alleged litany,” by TV
reporters. It was a responsive
reading which involved the
congregation through such
responses us "Help us to stop the

war," and "Heip us m
understand."

A highly religious aura
surrounded the demonstration.

Many University students were
there, but so were alot of
minister, chaplins- and nuns' The
presence or a number of reporters,
photographers, RV cameras, and
mikes was obvious. A few
policemen and a police
photographer watched from the
street. No violence occurred and
peacefulness seemed to rest upon
the demonstrators
