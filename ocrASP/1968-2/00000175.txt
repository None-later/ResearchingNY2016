‘Funhouse ’ Found

Grotesquer Comic

Lost in the Funhause, by John
Barth. Doubleday, 1968.

(CPS)--The harried Author
addresses his audience: "The
reader! You, dogged, uninsultabie,
print-oriented bastard." We read
on. Has the Author gone mad?
The reader? Mad indeed! When
the self sees its image reproduced
to inﬁnity in a Funhouse's
opposite mirrors. it might turn
away pleased by the illusion. or it
might (if it has reason to suspect
is own reality) linger and
ask.“Which is 'I'?" This
questioning-seif—conscious.
schizophrenic, and often
grotesquely hilarious - is the
essence of John Barth’s new
collection of 14 stories.

A writer operates just this side

of some dangerous ground. a
twilight zone where words,
himself and his whole purpose for
writing seem intangible.

disembodied. even ridiculous. This
time, instead of running from it.

Barth operates (albeit as an
oceiinogriipher observes the
depths from the safety of a

bathoscuph) and the result-41' a bit
self-indulgent--is fascinating.

The stories follow no linear
pattern (perhaps Barth's answer to
McLuhan?) and each one can only
be completely “read” in the
context of the entire book.
Stories play off against. and with.
each other like words in a very
tight poem. yet their complexities
create a rich chaos strung together
with symbol and metaphor.

is ridiculed.

Though many of the stories are
meant for tapeuand we have to
deal with print-~the desired effect
of ii “disembodied Autiiorial
Voice" can be achieved by just
keeping the recorded voice in
mind. In his experiments Barth

Lost in the Funhousc is a mock
epic of the human soul. Joyce is
here. with his “omphalos” iind
fabricator father (in this case
wicked). The journey-search of
Odysseus is unmistakeable.
Metaphor piles on metaphor and
thins get tremendously complex.
but Barth never loses control in an
exhilarating display of “passionate
virtuosity."

One hears much today of
"relevance." and movies have
sometimes been singled out as the
most “relevant” art for us now.
For instance. “Bonnie and Clyde
reveals the violence at the heart of
American legend, “La Guerre Est
Finis” concerns the fading belief
in Causes as guarantees of

I on

shows the frantic acceleration of
civilization's slaughter and
inhumanity. Okay: as a medium
for capturing current lifestyles
and ﬂeeting fashion s, nothing can
beat the cinema.

But i wonder if the talk about
relevance isn’t sometimes a
cockeyed didacticism, a reflection
of many people’s inability or
unwillingness to accept an
abstract theme. A work of art
needn't take a specific stand on a
current issue, or display
immediate tensions to be
relevant; in fact, this generates a
cramped, transitory art. It seems
to me that what’s most relevant is
least transitory; the best art treats
eternal truths about man's life in
the context of a revealing (current
or not) situation. Thus “Bonnie
and Clyde" is mainly about the
hairline separating innocence and
destructiveness; this theme
becomes more powerful for being
set in an era when American
suffered from delerium-tremans
not unlike those of now.

All this is a reverse-English
prologue to a movie that will
please the most finicky
relevantizer: Gillio Pontecorvo’s

FILMS

by Dave Bordwell

"The Battle of Algiers." It is,
ﬁrstly, lastly, and brutally. about
a specific situation--the struggle
for Algerian independence in the
Fifties--and is a practical
textbook of guerrilla strategy.
Yet, it's as well a depth sounding
of the moral ambiguities
surrounding any revolutionary

‘ and a vigorous poem
about man’s will to resist
oppression.

Pontecorvo pushes our noses
against the nitty gritty of
terrorism. The protagonist, a
young Arab, joins an undrgroun d
cadre. and through his eyes we
follow the fascinating. grueling
duel of Arabs vs. French.

We see the logistics of political

catches it in shatterineg

There’s none of the moral
flatness that I suspect pleases the
relevantizers. Although the

French are clearly in the wrong,
they‘re seen not as wantonly
cruel, but rather as men in a
delicate, if wrongheaded, situation
of political pressure. Moreover.
some of the revolutionaries'
tactics--slaughter of children and
innocents-- make one (me, at
least) restrain wholehearted
sympathy for their methods.
And-double helping of irony--the
French commander can outwit
the revolutionaries because he
fought in the French underground
during the war!

Pontecorvo shows an
understanding of the complexities
of commitment. a sorrowful
awareness of inevitable excess that
alone would make the movie
transcend the category of
"political" even if it lacked heroic
dimensions.

But it doesn’t. When the
terrorists are killed and peace
seems restored, riots erupt.

Thousands of Arabs swarm against
police lines. hollering and
scuffling. In the film’s last shot,
an Arab woman breaks away from
the line. defiantly taunting the
French soldiers; moving toward
and away from us, waving her sash
like a banner, she furiously shouts
for freedom. It is on this
image--angry. disquieting. harshly
beautiful--that “The Battle of
Algiers“ ends. Relevant. certainly,
but also timeless.

Cockrell Concert

Acclaimed Success

by Fred Waite

A large number of both
students and music-lovers from
the area turned out to hear
Findlay Cockrell, a member of the

music faculty here at the
University, perform last Thursday
night at Page Hall on the
pianoforte.

What made this concert most
enjoyable was Cockrell’s informal
discussion after his first number.
It is perhaps ludicrous to make

the analogy but there is
an interesting parallel between
Cockrell's loquacity and his

expressive quality on the piano.
For his first piece. he played
Sonata in C Major No. 58. by
Haydn. The first movement.
Andante con espressione. he
performed par excellence. What
could have been a mere
perfunctory rendition was
rendered by Cockrell a
“tete-a-tete” affair. His
comphrension of dramatic timing
between the slow phrases and of
dynamics left the audience on the
edge of their seats for the rest of
this piece. and set up a “highly
charged" atmosphere that was to
pervade the rest of the concert.

Presents

Reading

and is Writer in Residence at
Holiins College. Virginia. He has
published six collections of
poetry. including The chl Room
of the Dream.

Critical acclaim'has not been
unanimous; many critics feel that
the element of self mocking in his
wit hampers the success of his
most serious poems. Nevertheless.
they recognize Nemerov for his
ability to represent in his writing
the helplessness and tragedy of
the events of our time.

After this piece, he gave the
audience an unexpected treat.
Saying that he had just ﬁnished
with an evening lecture class. he
felt a compulsion to speak about
the next selection. Schubert's
Sonata in D Major D.V. 850. He
said that some of the
technicalities of this piece he
himself had not understood until
he was twenty-three years old. He
went on to illustrate the different
modes and changes in key in the
piece.

He provoked laughter from the
audience when he mentioned how
a student once asked him after a
concert whether a jazzy
syncopation played by himself
had been written by the composer
or had been his own addition. He
answered by saying that there are
times in various pieces that are
syncopated figures written by the
composer. and thus are not
additions by the artist. When he
finished the audience showed its
appreciation for Cockrell‘s
informative discussion with its

applause.

Cockrell then plunged into the
Schubert Sonata. The second
movement. Con mate (with

animation). was extremely well
done. The haunting lyrical phrase
seemed to echo in one’s ears. The
final movement, Rondo: Allegro
moderato, was a “fun thing." It
was obvious Cockrell was enjoying
himself. It left the audience eager
to hear him ply after the
intermission.

The third piece was one of
Mozart's most significant works
for piano, the Fantasy in C Minor.
K. 475. Cockrell again showed his
ability at playing a lyrical phrase
ivith the right touch of controlled
passion. V

Summing it up, Mr. Cockrell
gave a phenomenal performance.
which incidentally. reflects on the
high calibre of the faculty in our
Music Department.
