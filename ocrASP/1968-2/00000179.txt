Adaptation

Brings Best Of Shaw

“The Duel of
presented by the
Readers this past weekend,
provided an hour of George
Bernard Shaw’s wit, poignancy,
and wisdom. The short play
consists of several scenes from
Shaw’s plays connected by a well
written narrative by Patricia
Benedetto Snyder.

Director Linda Sternberg
obviously gave careful attention
to every detail in the
production-.from the black and
white color contrast of the
costumes to, the effective use of
the total blackout which further
reinforced the color scheme. The
staging is limited but never
monotonous; William F. Snyder
and Barbara Devio play each scene
in an amazing number of different
stage positions.

Snyder as He is excellent,
particularly scoring in
“Pygmalion,” Caesar and
Cleopatra," “Androcles and the
Lion," and Shaw’s
Correspondence. Snyder, rather
than merely portraying the
embodiment of the Shavian male,
becomes Henry Higgins, Caesar,
Androcles, and many other
characters with equal ease.

Barbara Devio as She does a
fine job protraying the many
Shavian women. In the final scene
in Act One, a segment from “Man
and Superman,” she portrays the
“desigining woman" with such
authenticity that not only is she
remarkably convincing but almost
frighteningly so.

Patricia Snyder has skillfully
integrated the voice of Shaw,
recorded by Msgr. William J.
Shannon, with the narrative.

To use a George Bernard Shaw
allusion, it is a great pleasure to sit
back and be entertained by some
Shavian roses after the recent
cabbage presented by SUT.

First
Telethon

For 24 hours this past weekend
University students hurdled that
wall which Mark Itudd,
Columbia’s revolutionist leader,
spoke about last Wednesday. For
24 hours
University students were
“infinitely more beautiful" than
those at Columbia or any other
University. For 24 hours this past
weekend University students
worked at peak efficiency to raise
moeny for mental health.
Whether the First Annual
Campus Chest Telethon was an
absolute ﬁnancial success is only
secondary because it was an
absolute success from all other
standpoints. Some of the
entertainment was terrible,

especially the guitar-strumming
folk singers who had a great deal
of difficulty singing on key, but
the audience enthusiastically
applauded, thanking the
performer for his time and efforts.

At several moments on Friday
night, the Telethon became a
State University Theatre reunion
with cast members singing the hit
songs of old productions;
however, it was precisely at these
moments when the Telethon was
at its best.

Judi Ann Weisen, whose talent
was severely restricted in “The
Skin Of Our Teeth," could do no
wrong as mistress of cer '
Whether auctioning off kisses or
teasing the audience with the
exaggerated torso movements of
“Big Spender (remember the guy
from Dellmore); she infused the
Ballroom with the spirit and
enthusiasm characteristic of all
good telethons.

Both Dean Sorrell Chesin and
Mr. Martin Mann were having such
fun as two of the many masters of
ceremonies that the audience
could not help but enjoy
themselves. if the success of a
master of ceremonies can be
measured by the money he takes
in, then both these men were

The long list of entertainment
goes on and on with Mrs. Patricia
Synder and the Statesmen
deserving particular mention. Mrs.
Snyder sang “As Long as he Needs
Me” the way the song was
intended to be sung. Her version
of “Just You Wait 'Enry ’Iggins"
was delightful. The Statesmen
performed with gusto as they sang
their many selections, which
ranged from their theme song to
“Thoroughly Modern Millie" and
“The Impossible Dream.” .

The auctions were just as
entertaining as ‘many of the
performers. The audience was
willing, although in many cases a
little unwilling, to overpay for
quite a few worthless items. The
small records and the larger
albums were sometimes sold for
twice their list price.

The Telethon brought out the
best in both the performers and
the audience. The entire 24 hour
production had a high degree of
professionalism and good taste.
Many people deserve quite a bit of
credit for planning, working, and
staging the Telthon. Certainly a
large share of the plaudits must go
to Linda Berdan and Eileen
Deming who produced and
directed the Telethon.

TELETHON: NOV.22 - 23 , 1968

Telethon S Goes To Project

  
  

An Anal
Telethon

by Jim Small

In March, 1967 the Mental
Health Telethon was an
accomplished fact. The Telethon,
the first of its kind on any campus
in the country, marked the entry
of the University student into a
new area of human affaris.

On November 22 and 23, 1968,
Special Events Board sponsored
the first annual Campus Chest
Telethon. This second telethon
was meant to uphold the values
established by the first.

Thesetwo events were similar
only in their goals. The first raised
money specifically for mental
health work. The second added to
this educational aid to South End
students from area schools.

The first telethon can be said to
have had the following
characteristics: an independent
organization, goodpublicity, and
most important, plenty of time.

The -independent organization
is a very good point, it guarantees
a group of idealistic workers who
will carry the event. It is also a
bad point, because an established
student organization has
developed methods for meeting
and coping with the rules and
regulations of the University.

Good publicity, on and off
campus, is the greatest planning
factor for a good event. Once the
occasion takes on distinguishing
characteristics in the eyes of the
public it will be supported.

Time is the critical factor in all
large events. Everything must be
organized, checked and run
through beforehand to guarantee
workability. The first telethon did
this admirably.

The second telethon was run by
Special Events Board, had poor on
campuspublicity, and was set up
on very short notice.

Organizationally, both
telethons functioned very well.
Each had its own minor
catastrophie’a to deal with. Erch
survived the encounter.

The Campus Chest Telethon
had off campus publicity, via
radio and television, in its favor.
There was only an inadequate,
11th hour effort to reach the
students here on campus. The first
telethon had well established
communications with the student
body (ASP, posters, WSUA etc.)
and closed circuit television
during the event. Both of these
factors are pluses.

The major problems the recent
telethon faced was the short.
amount of time available in which
to put a show together. This was,
overcome through the efforts of
many talented University
students.

Both telethons had established
goals; the first one at $7500, the

 

ytic C(mpariso

  

1968 And1967

second at $10,000. The receipts
from the first were approximately
$5300, from the second
approximately $3000. The
seriousness of this disparity
becomes obvious when you
consider the growth of the
University between the two
events.

Both telethons were moral
successes, but at least partially,
practical and financial failures.
They both, to a greater or lesser
degree, failed to tap the reservoir
of money in this University. Both
set their goals at approximately
$1.00 for each student member of
the University community. Both

T elethon

The extravaganza called the
“24 hour entertainment
show—Telethon" came to an end
at 7:00 pm, Saturday night.
When all the shouting died down,
and the last round of applause was
over, more than 2600 dollars had
been collected.

The telethon, produced by
Linda Berdan, and directed by
Eileen Deming, was put together
in a relatively short period of
time. Things moved quickly and
in approximately three weeks
time all preparations had been
completed.

The Telethon attracted
approximately 700 students in its
24 hour run. The house was
packed at 1:30 Friday night,
when the production of “The
Rape and indignation of Little
Nell" was shown. This skit, an
original story with music written
by Steve Hasch and story written
by Bill Doscher, was recaived
overwhelmingly by the audience.
The cast received a standing
ovation at the close of their
performances.

Among the many Masters of
Ceremonies were Dean Sorrell
Chesin, Prof. Marty Mann of the

Speech Department, and Dell
Thompson, Assistant Dean of
Students, Also acting as MC’s

failed to reach their coal:

The success: or failure of any
event taking place onthis campus
must be judged in the light of
student participation. The poor
attendance of the last telethon
serves as a mirror for the apathy
that stains the student body here.

As I said to many people during
the telethon, “What we want is
$1.00 per person. some of you
can’t contribute, and that I
understand. To those who can
(could) and won’t (didn't) I say
‘God bless you' and I hope none
of your children are ever
‘tarded."

by Kathy Human

Within the past ye rr, 72,000
man hours of survice to
individuals have been provided by
students under the Student
Mental Health Work-Study Intern
Program.

Approximately 50% of the
proceeds of the Telethon will be
contributed to this cause. The
basic aim of the program, as
Richard Gallo, project
coordinator, stated, is to solve the
man power shortage existing in
various community service
agencies and to utilize the student
community.

Presently, the Intern Program
involves 18 students and eight
agencies. Gallo is trying to expand
the program to "stretch down
into the neighborhoods." The
Program will hopefully stretch
across the state with units in every
school.

Students are now hired and
paid a stipend by the Program.
The participating agencies pay the
Program '6 of the student’s salary.
Last year this money enabled the
Program to hire 40 students for
summer work. Gallo anticipates
that this summer the Program will
be continued; for this phase, he is
interested in placing students in
agencies located near their home.

The activities of the students
vary depending upon the type of
agency with which they work.
Included in those aided are
children, the elderly, the retarded,
and emotionally disturbed
children. ‘

On participating institution is
Vanderheyden Hall, a residence
for approximately 120 deprived

or neglected children. The
students working there serve
many functions, but they very
importantly provide people to
whom the children can relate.
Gallo mentioned instances where
children have turned to
mischievious and criminal acts in
order to receive the attention
which they so desperately crave.

Gallo stressed that this program
is not meant to encourage careers
in social welfare, but rather to
“give the student a better view of
what the community needs."

"The major pre‘requisite is
interest." He urged interested
students to write for further
information to Richard Gallo,
NYS Assoc. for Mental Health, 90
State Street, Albany, NY 12207

Currently, students at Sienna,
St. Rose, and Union receive credit
for their work from their schools.
Gallo hopes for to initiate it at
thisUniversity. If credit is offered,
the stipend can be lowered and it
would enable more students to
participate.

The lack of greater funds
prevents the expansion of the
program to include more students.

Concerning the telethon, Gallo
said that it is valuable for
generating student interest in
what is essentially a student cause.
The telethon, two years ago,
indicated the desire of students
for direct service. It was the
contribution which necessitated
the formation of an organization
to coordinate student work with
the manpower shortage.

Features Skits, Pies, Kisses
RaisesOver 2,600 Dollars For Charity

were Dan Lego, Jay Silverman,
Stephanie Rice, Tony Casale, Vic
Looper, Jay Hershkowitz, Jim
Small, Judi Wiesen, and many
other performers.

Entertainment was at a
relatively high level throughout
the event. Periods of inactivity
were few and far between.

The Pie-In—The-Face routine
proved to be a lucrative idea. Jim
Kahn went for $86, Jim Small for
$22, and Prof. Sargent for $82.
This, in addition to the kisses
auctioned off by sororities, was a
good source of money.

The major donors to the
telethon included the following:

Kappa Chi R0, Duncan Nixon,
Psi Gum, Classes of '69, ’70, '71,
‘72, STB, EEP, Hillel, Chi Sig,
