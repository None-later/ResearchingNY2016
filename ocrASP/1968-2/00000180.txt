Nix On

Sports

With the completion of the new physical education building, Albany

has also seen a vastly broadened AMIA program.

During the past two years, the AMIA program has been both

expanded and improved tremendously. In the major sports (football,

basketball, and baseball) the facilities open to the participants have

been greatly improved.

4 Before the football playing fields were relocated on the new campus,

the teams played in the conunon of the Alumni Quad. While this area is

not the worst place possible for playing, the fields were quite often torn

up by the continuous passage of students over them when they passed

back and forth to the Union.

In contrast to this, the football ﬁelds on the new campus are located

such that they are isolated from the normal ﬂow of trafﬁc, yet are

easily reached by those wishing to use them. Such a setup makes for

better playing conditions for all involved.

The basketball situation has surely improved as the AMIA leagues are

now able to use the new courts of the athletic building. These courts

are an unmeasureable improvement over antiquated Page which was

small even for intramural competition.

The softball leagues have also been given improved playing fields as

they are able to play on diamonds which, although they don't have

inﬁelds, at least are not riddled with numerous dips and mounds.

Perhaps the greatest improvement of the AMIA program has come in

the area of the lesser known sports.

This year, the first annual cross-country meet was run under the

direction of Coach Munsey. Although the turnout of participants was

not over-whelming, Mr. Munsey stated that he was pleased with the

results and was planning another race for next year.

Two other sports are both in their second year of existence. This past

week, the second annual swim meet was held with a number of athletes

competing. With the Olympic size pool in the athletic building, AMIA is

able to conduct a worthwhile and strongly competitive contest.

The second event planned by AMIA is a handball tournament to be

held shortly. Last year, only one division was formed with the winner

receivrng a medal. This year, two divisions are planned; one for novices

and one for the more experienced competitors.

Study Abroad

In Israel
Now Offered

by Amy Gurtan

Study abroad programs have
emerged with 2 integral goals:
promoting academic excellence in
a field, and promoting
international understanding. In
cooperation with the American
Friends of the Hebrew University
of Jerusalem, SUNY offers a
full-year program in Israel with

these goals in mind.

Undergraduates are required to
have completed at least 2 years of
college before their departure. A
few graduate students are also
eligible.

Prior knowledge of Hebrew is
not absolutely required, although
a familiarity with the language is
desirable. Students will be given
an intensive language course, the
Hebrew University “Ulpan,” from
August through October. Students
will be enrolled as full-time
students for the academic year,
from November through June.

Courses will be offered in both
English and Hebrew, and in
addition, a course for SUNY
students will be taught by a
professor accompanying the
group. Students will receive up to
36 semester hours of credit from
SUNY.

The joint project was founded

by Dl'. Yonah Alexander,
Associate Professor Political
Science, at the State University
College at Oneonta with the

Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
Dr. Alexander has also organized a
summer session, for 6 semester
credits.

Early n p plication is
recommended. Additional
information and application forms
are available in the office of John
Nicolopoulos. Coordinator of
International Programs, Social
Science, Room 381.

Campus

by Nancy Durlsh Staff Reporlel‘

In recent years, the University
has become more liberal in its
attitude toward the students'
formulation of standards and
limitations in non-academic areas.

This liberalization, giving
students more freedom and
responsibility, is seen in the
continual changes occurring in
policies concerning alcohol,
women‘s hours, and visitation
periods.

The LAAC Bill concerning
Proposed Changes in University
Residence Policies is now on the
verge of becoming to reality. On
Tuesday, Student Affairs Council
passed three of the four points of
the bill, as follows:

I. There are no curfew hours
for any University student. II.
There is no mandatory sign-out
procedure for any University
student. A voluntary sign—out
system may be provided by the
residents of the hull/or hull
government.

FRIDAY, DECEMBER 6. I968

Court Rescinds

Mandatory Tax

by Barry Klrschn.

The Supreme Court has ruled
that the ‘referendum' held on
October 2325 concerning a
mandatory student fee shall be
interpreted as nothing more than
an opinion poll. The Court
unanimously decided that “since
no legislative proposal was
presented to the student body in
the 'referendum’, there was no
referendum."

The decision of the court
substantiated the claims in the
Nealy, and Schlecht and Kichen
referrals, that the ‘referendum’
was no more than an opinion poll.

Liberalization:

LAAC Bill In Final Stages

III. During visitation, all
students may exercise their right
to privacy by leaving suite and/or
bedroom doors closed and locked
if they so choose.

The bill is scheduled to be
presented to the University
Council by President Collins for
final approval on Dec. 12.

At this time the outlook for the
bill is very optimistic, and
assuming final approval is given,
will go into effect as soon as
possible according to University
procedure.

April of 1967 marked the end
of hours for all upper-class
women, and determined the
restrictions to be placed upon
freshman women.

Prior to this date, many
proposals to case restrictions on
women’s hours had been drawn
up, including the Key System
Proposal in March of 1966. This
proposal, in which existing
curfews would be maintained
while extending a key privilege to
every upperclass woman, was
passed by Central Council, but no
subsequent action was taken on it.

The first major legislation
concerning the alcohol policy at
the University was passed in
March of 1‘367. According to this
policy, hour will be served in the
Rutlislteller, and alcoholic
beverages will be available in the
l’ntroon Itoom and at specified
University functions.

Later, the bill wi-s amended to

THE PROBLEM OF BIRTH CONTROL was debated in the second Firing Line presentation. Future over

  

include the Mohawk and Dippikil
campuses. No alcohol, however, is
allowed in the residence halls or
the residence courtyards of the
quads.

Various proposals are scheduled
for LAAC hearings in the near
future, according to Vic Looper,
Chairman of LAAC. They include
proposals concerning alcohol in
residence halls, a lock-box
cylinder system for women
entering the ahhalls after closing,
and the residence policy in which
each dorm will be able to
determine its own visitation and
open house policies.

Firing

Line

decause of Supreme Court‘s
decision, there will be no
mandatory student fee in the

Spring ’69 semester.

A dispute over the meaning of
the word referendum brought up
in the Nealy referral and the open
hearing of the case before

Supreme Court led the court to
define the word ‘referendum' as

the “submission of a legislative act
to the students for a binding
vote."

The Supreme Court also
declared unconstitutional the
‘Waiver of Payment of Mandatory
Fee for Economic Reasons' and
‘Penalty for Non-Payment of
Mandatory Fee’, since these bills
assumed the existence of a
mandatory fee.

Also pointed out in the
decision is that to act in
accordance with a decision of the
Trustees of the State University of
New York, the Central Council
would have to be elected by the
student body and not the student
association if they wished to
establish a mandatory tax.
Presently only those members of
the student body who pay student
tax are members of student
association and allowed to vote
for Central Council. The court
also ruled against: the challenges,
in the referrals, concerning the
wording of the ballot and the
absence of a minimum
requirement of the number of
voters. It also decided that a
majority vote was sufficient to
enact legislation.

Debate :

Birth Control Methods

bV Doris Steinhardt

Another Firing Line debate was
presented last night on the subject
"Birth Control--Methods and
Morality." The speakers were Dr.
H. Curtis Wood, ltev. Frank
Snow, Prof. Joseph Blniber, and
Bill Ithodc.

Dr. Wood first stressed how
serious he feels the problem of
overpopulation is. by the year
2000, world population will
double, and there will be 7 billion
people to be fed.

Dr. Wood believes that massive
starvation is a strong possiblity,
and that people are not going to
just "sit around and starve or

watch their children starve." We

 

population is to he dell with by technology according to the opposer to the pill, and through birth control
by the pill's advocate. Panelists, (l to r) Dr. Joseph lllader, Dr. Curtis Wood, William Rhode, and Rev. Frank

Snow. by Sue SIiepor

may have to contend with riots,
mass slaughtering, and overthrow
of governments.

What can we do now‘.’ Dr.
Wood believes that married
couples should stop at two

children. If the average number of
children per family ir- three, the
population will double every 40
years. "For the future welfare of
the country, we must level off
somewhere."

Dr. Wood is Medicul Consultant
for the Association for Voluntary
Sterilization. He advocates
teaching people the advantages
and disadvantages of all mvthods
of birth control and performing
sterilization when it is desired.

The principle objection to Dr.
Wood '5 comments raised by both
Snow and Bluibcr was that the
moral question lay in the fact that
the resources we have are so
unevenly distributed. We should
attack this problem because there
is over-population right now,
rather than worrying about the
year 2000.

Dr. Wood also said that
technology would not deal with
the problem of overpopulation.
Cities under the sell and
settlement of the North and
South Poles are possibilities, but
he feels that they won’t become
reality. Rev. Snow, on the other
hand, expressed the opinion that
technology will be able to deal
quite sufficiently with
overpopulatlon.
