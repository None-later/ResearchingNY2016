"No one will be admitted
during the last twelve minutes!"
gasps the ad for Joseph Losey‘s
“Secret Ceremony” (Hellman). It
would be fairer to us if it added,
“And we discourage anyone from
seeing the preceding hundred and
eight."

The very ﬁrst shot is archetypal
Losey: Liz Taylor before a mirror
yanks off a wig and tosses it on a
statuette of Jesus while a picture
of her daughter glares out from
the mantle. From there on,
Losey’s' sinuous camera has lots of
fun with baroque decor, mirrors,
windows, arches, staircases-all his
characteristic clap trap that looks
so good in “The Servant" and
"Accident" but in “Secret
Ceremony" resembles the
daydreams of the editors of
"House Beautiful." Grierson said
that when a director dies he
becomes a photographer; when
Losey- dies, he becomes an interior
decorator.

Yet, “Secret Ceremony" does
offer things to watch. We can look
at Liz Taylor, blowzier and
coarser than ever, wallowing
around in leather and ermine. For
once her acting resources aren't
overland-mainly she has lines
like, “Aw, have a heart!"~ but
when she’s called upon to deliver
a full-throated burp, it’s pleasant
to see she pulls it off as if she'd
been practicing all her life.

Or you can look at Robert

Arlo Guthrie Takes

Folk World By

WWI Fine

(CPS)--Rarely does a performer
take the folk world with such a
storm as has Arlo Guthrie. He has
avoided the inevitable
comparisons with his father, the
late Woody Guthrie, and set up a
distinctive style of his own. And
not only is he a natural comedian,
but a good singer and a very good
guitarist.

He made “Alice’s Restaurant"
something of an anthem for the
draft-conscious, and people were
so taken by this hugely funny
effort that many overlooked the
fine vocals on the other side of
the album.

On his new album, “Arlo” (on
Reprise), he combines his vocals
with his monologues, throwing in
his latest kick--meditation.

It starts out with a new version
of his "Motorcycle Song" which
appeared in the ﬁrst album.
There, it was just a little too pat,
too well-done, Here it is new and
includes a very funny monologue
about how he came to write the
song.

He was, he claims, going down
a road on his motorcyle at 150
mph playing his guitar when he

Storm

went over a cliff. He knew it was
the end, so he decided to write
one last farewell song to the
world. “I put a new cartridge in
my pen, took outs piece of paper
and sat back and thought a
while." And he wrote the song
that is this poetry.

Guthrie has been moving
toward transcendental meditation.
He makes good use of it in
“Meditation (Wave upon Wave).”
It's a song flavored with modes of
India, sounding like a kind of
monotone chant with a
mysterious variety to it. The song
is enhanced by use of a tabla.
Also, his guitar work is laudable
on this song.

He finishes the album with a
very funny talk on why he
dedicates a song to the FBI. The
song--”'l‘he Pause of Mr.
Claus"--aska "Why do police guys
pick on peace guys?" And it tells
why the FBI should investigate
Santa Claus (“Santa Claus wears a
red suit/He's a communi st")'

He seems to have hit it just
right once again. The only
question in my mind was there
after his first album, too: How
can he follow it?

tonight and tomorrow night in

the Campus Center cafeteria.

Erica, Jon and Dick project a
somewhat different image in
comparison to last year; the trio
seems to be more conservative and
more proficient in their work.
Their selections are primarily
comprised of folk ballads rather
than rock. Their ballads are not
only meaningful but also catch
and hold the attention of the
audience.

The trio’s voices are succinct
and commanding. They
harmonize very well together and
their vicious nature only adds to
their successful performance.

“The End of a Beautiful Day"
concerns a young man who is
about to face a gloomy and empty
world because his only love has
left him. “The Homecoming" is a
melancholy tune which concerns

a

an anxious father who is ' ' ,,
the arrival of his two sons. He has
not seen them for a long time and
is disheartened to learn that they
have chosen to visit friends rather
than him. The father’s life, which
at first appeared to be so short,
suddenly seemed too long to him.
The trio's rendition of "Love is
Blue," displaying Erica’s charming
and enchanting voice, is
, ' ' ', done. A ' " that
I particularly enjoyed was
“Nothing to Say:" another tune
in which Erica’s voice captivates
her audience. This selection deals
with the cruelty of time: two
friends who have long been
separated finally meet, and
discover they have nothing to say
to each other. Time has ruined
their once treasured friendship.
Erica, Jon and Dick succeed in
thoroughly entertaining their
a u d i e n ce.

‘Mitchum, in a part obviously
meant for Burton but which he
ﬁlls like wet Kleenex: college
professor on the make. The old
pro drags through every scene
with his eyes open an eighth of an
inch, looking as if all the incest,
rape, and general pscyhopathic
melee were going to put him right
to sleep. His best line is
“Sometimes one has to choose
between good taste and being a
human being.” somehow, he
manages to reject both.

Then theres Mia Farrow, her
hair dyed black and her eyes
rolling loonily enough to convince
anybody that she’s got big
problems. Mommy is an uneasy
melangc of understatement,
obviousnus, grotesquerie, cheap
thrills, and absurd Absurd. Some
of the color is nice,
though~muted greens and icy
blues--and there’s one tense
moment of cutting when Liz is
haranguing Mia at the end. It's all
Losey, no doubt: a fastidious
slirniness oozes out of every fram.
But the man simply can ’t choose a
script! He can integrate sparse,
hard-edged material a la Pinter
with his own contorted,
ﬂamboyant visuals and make it all
fancin creepy, but he can’t seem
to smell the difference between
that and Tennessee Williams
turgidity (“Boom”) or 1930‘s
hack fiction (“Secret
Ceremony".) So we wind up with
a chic, Londonized Tobacco Road
that demonstrates that Losey can
make more vulgarly awful movies
than any other important
film-maker around. It’s too bad
that sometimes one has to choose
between bad taste and being a
good director. ’

Refuses To Close Campus

By DONALD B. THACKREY
SAN FRANCISCO (UPI)—
Acting President S. I. Hayaka-
wa Thursday stood firm against
demands for closure of embat-

As 600 officers remained on

Mayor Joseph Alloto and Gov.
Ronald Reagan have endorsed
Hayakawa’s get-tough policy for

the campus.

A group of Negro civic
leaders pledged to join the
demonstrations to show their

support for a campus strike
started Nov. 6 by the Black
Students Union. Their demand
for a shutdown of the school
and removal of police were
rebuffed by Hayakawa in a
stormy session Wednesday.

BSU members listed among
their “non-negotiable” demands
reinstatement of Black Panther
George Murray as a part-time

instructor and a graduate
student. Hayakawa charged
they were being duped by
Students for a Democratic

Society—one of the more
radical campus groups in the
nation.

In announcing the Saturday
rally, SDS spokesman John
Levin said “we consider the
strike 80 per cent effective in
terms of fulltime students."
