Comments On

Virus Spread

by Tim Keeley

President Evan
discussed the current illness on
campus, the increased room rate
for next year and the proposed
changes in the residence policy at
The President's Conference with
Students yesterday.

"The present illness does not
seem to be the Hong Kong Flu
but rather a respiratory virus,"
Collins indicated.

At present there are between
750 and 1000 students with
various stages of the virus. This
includes 38 in the infirmary.

“We have no serious intention

of closing school," remarked
Collins. “We'll take another look
at the situation if the rate
increases.”

Collins then commented on the
statement issued from Chancellor
Gould concerning the increase in
residence hall rates.

The new rates will go into
effect as of July 1, 1969. The
increase will be $170 a year,
bringing the cost of room to
$550.

Students were assured that
Financial Aids will take this
increase into account as much as
possible when arranging loans and
scholarships.

When asked if the possibility of
allowing Greeks to move off
campus would lessen the burden
Collins declared, “The present
housing shortage is not the best
way to change University policy
toward the Greeks.“

Collins was then asked to
comment on the status of a bill
proposing residence changes.

He stated that he expected to
receive a final copy of the bill
“momentarily.” (The three
changes to be considered are
abolition of freshmen women's
hours, and the choice of closing
doors during open room
visitations.)

Collins will then meet with the
University Council on Thursday.
At that time, “i will recommend
the three points and 1 fully expect
them to be accepted," Collins
commented.

Collins was also called upon to
comment on the recent decision
handed down by the University's
Supreme Court. The decision in

effect declared Student
Association an unrepresentative
body.

lie remarked, “i will still turn
to Student Association for the
best. body that represents the
most students," Collins
concluded.

The purpose of the Sing is to

loving cup, to the best student
vocal group on campus.

The songs which are used in the
programming of the Sing are
chosen by the individual groups,
on a first come—first serve basis.
Each group is asked to choose two
songs which they will sing during
the program; one of them during
the normal competition, and the
other one during the final
