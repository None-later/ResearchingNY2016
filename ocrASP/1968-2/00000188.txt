Staging , Lighting

Defeat Talent Show

by Gary Gelt

“Kaleidoscope,” the annual
all-University Talent Show
presented this past weekend in
Page Hall, offered the best in
student talent, but the poor
staging and lighting defeated the
abilities of several performers.

For the most part the
performers were professional and
proficient. Dennis Buck. playing
an inventive and fluid tribute to
Barbra Streisand, and Judi Ann
Wiesen, singing and dancing to a
comic version of "The Kiss of
Fire," once again proved that
talent can overcome inadequate
staging and lighting.

All the singers, especially Lia
Petkanas with her rendition of
“What Did I Have That 1 Don‘t
Have Now," and Gary Aldrich
with a medley of Rogers and
Hammerstein songs, displayed
line voices and good stage
presence. “The Flowers," a comic
novelty number about life at the
University, picked up the pace
nicely after the disasterous and
pointless “Geographic Fugue."

The chorus of 15 were clumsy
in the confusing "Kaleidoscope
Tonight" opener, but when they
performed "Anything Goes" they
displayed a great deal of grace in
moving around the small stage.

However talented most of these
people were, they couldn't do a
thing about the oh—eo-slow staging
of the entire production. The
audience waited in suspense for
what seemed like five minutes in

between each act. When the
performer finally got on stage, the
lighting was so poor that the
audience, sitting in total darkness,
could not read the name of the
performer from the program, nor,
in two cases, could the performer
ﬁnd the microphone. During most
of the show the audience was
watching a nameless, faceless
person performing on a dingily lit

stage.
What could have been an
effervescent and sparkling

exhibition of student talent was
merely a lethargic shadow of a
poor Ted Mack Amateur Hour. 1f
co-directors Gary Restifo and
Kathi O'Neil and lighting
chairman Eileen Deming showed
the wit and cleverness of Dennis
Bucl.'s piano recital or the spirit
and enthusiasm of Judi Ann
Wicsen’s comedic song, then
“Kaleidoscope” could have been
cured of its acute case of tired
blood.

Music COuncil Explains

Difﬁculties

Concert

by Holly Seitz

Why can’t the University have
big names like Simon and
Garfunkle for its concerts? Target
of questions like this is Joel
Richmond, president of
Contemporary Music Council,
which has sponsored the series of
contemporary popular artists.

There are more problems
lnvolvad in presenting a concert
than ticket sales and advertising.
Several factors effect the time,
price and artist.

One of the major limiting
factors at Albany is the seating
capacity of the gymnasium. At
full capacity the gym can hold
only about 3000 persons. This not
only effects the number who can
attend, but the ticket's price and
ultimately the artist who appears.

The budget of Contemporary
Music Council is approximately
$40,000 of which all but $18,000
must be repaid to theStudent
Activities fund. The size of the
budget has already limited the
choice of artists as popular
personalities price per concert is
out of range. With the amount of
funds available the Council must

Tovish Lectures

Here On Thurs

Art Council announces that
Harold ’fovish, the noted sculptor,
will prescnt a lecture and film
“Art and Technology" on
Thursday, December 12, at 8 p.m.
in the Art Gallery of the Fine
Ar ts Building.

For over twenty years Harold
Tovish has been working with
bronze, aluminum, wood, and
terracotta to produce images that
reﬂect his war experiences-the
terror of children involved and the
horrors of Nazi concentration
camps.

He continued his involvement
with the theme of the victim ty
presenting figures both within and
without actual enviornments.
Through the use of light and
motion, Tovish keeps his
beautifully idealized male heads
constantly changing.

He has held teaching positions
at the University of Minnesota
and the School of the Boston
Museum. Between teaching duties
Tovish has made several extended
stays in Europe, most recently in
1966 as sculptor in residence at
the American Academy in Home.

A cordial invitation is extended
to the entire University
community to attend this lecture.

select an artist who will fit the
price range.

Tickets provide part of the
artist’s fee. Certain performers
play for a flat fee per concert, for
instance Judy Collins’ was $4000.
Others demand a lower fee plus a
percentage of the ticket sales.

The ticket price must be kept
comparitively low because of the
Student Tax. Big name artists are
not as likely to play for a lowered
fee and a percentage of the ticket
sales if a ticket costs only $1.50
and a maximum of 3,000 can be
Rnlgnother factor in the price of
an artist is the night of the
concert. Prime nights of Friday
and Saturday skyrocket the fee.

l

The question which has yet to
be answered is will a concert that
is scheduled during the week draw
the students away from studying?

Another problem is to schedule
concerts when other activities are
in progress like Homecoming
Weekend. This matching of artist
to weekend is very difficult as
performers are sometimes
reluctant to book too far in
advance.

College dates are often
considered the bottom of the pile
by artists, not only becuase of the
fee but also because the artsists
are freer to break a contract as the
school or organization hasn’t the
time or patience to carry a suit to
court.

FILMS

l urge you to see at once Philip
Saville's neat, discreet “Oedipus
the King" (Scotia Art Theatre).
it’s a heavily “theatrical” film
(the touches of “cinema” are
self«conscious and extraneous);
but all movies needn’t have fancy
cutting or clever camera-work.
Saville mainly restricts the action
to the clearing before Oedipus’
palace, and records Christopher
Plummer, Orson Welles, Lilli
Palmer, and an ominously
chanting chorus enacting under a
harsh sun the remorseless rhythm
of pride and anguish of Sophocles’
tragedy.

Plummer’s Oedipus is tall,
strong, and keenly confident. He
harangues Creon and Tieresias like
a petty tyrant. When he boasts,
spit bursts from his mouth, and
the words, echoeing throughout
Thebes, make the populace turn
anxiously from their affairs. And
Plummer sends pity trickling
through one’s nerves when the
humbled, sightless Oedipus,
thinking Green is listening, talks
gently to an empty clearing.

The part of Jocasta, like that of
Queen Gertrude, demands that
the actress make an older woman
simultaneously regal, matronly,
and sensual. Lilli Palmer does, and
is completely convincing as queen,
wife, and mother. Orson Welles’
portrayal of Teiresias is as hefty as
granite; his physical bulk
commands the eye no less than his
rumbling voice arrests the ear like
an earth tremor: "It
will...all...out...in time."

Saville's open-air interpretation
strips the play to the bone, speech
following speech with a propulsive
rhythm that scarcely ever flags,
and the soundtrack-~echoing,
percussive music, the

by Dave Bordwell

becoming ever more urgent-~raises
the emotional pitch from scene to
scene.

Unfortunately, the film never
settles on one visual approach.
Sometimes it’s as grubbin realistic
as “The Gospel According to St.
Matthew" and at other moments
it's nearly as stylized as “Ivan the
Terrible." The two approaches are
incompatible only in the
extremes, but Saville's mixing of a
humble style (shots of peasants
working and suffering in the
plague) and a grand one (looming
shots on ruins, the chorus'
stylized patterns of movement) is
half-hearted and not particularly
skillful. Still worse, some
redundant ﬂashbacks of the
killing of Laius don't build the
tension but rather undercut it; to
us, the murder itself (handheld
camera contrasting nicely with the
formal rigor of the rest of the
film) is less interesting than
Oedipus' emotions while he
recounts it. These flashbacks are
probably attempts to “open up"
the play, but unless a director has
a powerful overall idea, he had
better leave such tricks alone:
they nearly always retard the
thrust of the action.

But the movie remains highly
affecting. (l'll never forget details
like Jocasta's coiled brooches that
Oedipus uses to pierce his eyes, or
the bored-looking little boy who
leads the fallen king into the
hills.) What we have here is a fine
transcription, a film that because
of the excellence of its
performances and the general
integrity of its execution should
not be missed. It's not a great
film, but it‘s a good film of a great
play, which is enough to make for
an overwhelming experience.

In Quadrangular

The Albany State wrestling
squad opened its season this past
Saturday with a second place
finish in their annual
Quadrangular tournament.

The Albany squad was led by
Ceth Seely and Craig Springer
who both won their respective
weight classes. Seely, in the
123-pound class, won both of his
matches by decisions as did
Springer-4n the 152-pound
division. Springer was particularly
impressive as he was not scored
upon in his two matches.

Hartwick, who won the match
was the only school competing
which had a wrestler in each
division. Albany forfeited only
the 116 and heavyweight classes
while third-place finishers
Rochester forfeited five places
and Dartmouth had only four
wrestlers for eleven spots.

In addition to Springer and
Seely, Albany was represented by
Pete Ranalli in the 130, Bob Kind
at 137, Fran Weal at 145, Frank
Berry at 160, George Hawrylchak
at 167, and John Furlyns at 191.

Hawrylchak, normally a 137 or
145~pound wrestler contributed as
expecially fine performance as he
easily outweighed by his
opponent yet was able to prevent
a pin and capture a third place
and valuable points for the
Albany team.

‘ The Albany squad looked very
Impressch in their first outing and
it would appear that they will be
able to improve upon last year’s
disasterous 1-10 record.

With Craig Springer mad Fran
Wenl returning as lcttermen the
squad has a fairly solid nucleus for
the coming year as they also have
Frank Berry, Alex Domkowski,
Marshall Gladstone, and George
Hawrylchak who all competed on
the varsity level returning to
participate again this year.

Coach Garcia is also looking for
strong performances from
sophomores Pete Ranalli and
Kevin Sheehan as well as from
transfers Ceth Seely and Bob
Kind.

 

Giles, Shafts Set Marks;

Choppers

This past Saturday, December
7, League I saw its finest scores
since the league moved from
Shade's Academy to the Campus
Lanes. All-time records for the
league were set for team
individual scores.

The highest Three-game series
in the history of the Campus lanes
was ruled this week as Al Giles of
Dundee, New York, exploded for
a phenomenal three-game series of
743, on. games of 267, 2411, and
232. Both the 7413 and the 267
single are highs for the season for
an individual bowler. Giles is
presently averaging 188.

The Shafts, now in third place,
bowled the highest three-game
series in recent league history.
Their total of 2911 was compiled
on games of 949, 934, and 1028,
which is an average of about 194
per bowler. Contributing to the
team effort were Al Giles with
743, Bob Eichhorn with 606,and
Ron Romano rolling 570.

Other high scores included Nich
Meister with 229-615. Bob
Eichhorn, 258, Chuck Ennis, 242,
Glenn Garver, 233. The league

Open With Losses

The Albany State Frosh, highly
praised by varsity coach Richard
“Doc” Sauers as possibly the best
in State history, have yet to find
the winning way after two games.

The Baby Dane, loaded with
high school talent, have dropped
disappointing contests to the
Oneonta frosh and to Mohawk
Valley Community College.
Saivaged out of the two losses
were some fine individual
performances and with them, the
hopes for a brighter future.

In their opening game against
Oneonta, the yearlings dropped a
close decision, 70-65, after leading
at half-time. Coach Bob Lewis‘
charges showed scoring punch as
center Mike Hill scored 19 points.
Mike, who stands 6' .’" and is
from Lansingburg, also rebounded
in double figures for the Danes.

Keith Ward, Gcnc Bost, and
John Hcher, all from the Elmira
area, paced the rest of the Albany
team with 14, 14, and 7 points.
Albany's fifth starter, Mike
Bendzel, contributed nine points.

in their second contest, the
Frosh again led their opponents at
half-time. Mohawk Valley found
itself trailing, 25-21, but allowed
State oniyfiftecn points in the
final half of the contest while its
