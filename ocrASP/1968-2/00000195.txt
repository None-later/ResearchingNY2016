institution from college to

can continue to turn out the

University Product. Without the maturation of the

student body there shall be no

aspect to the Albany alumnus, no attachment, no
tradition, no sense of accomplishment, no feeling
of effectiveness. This void in our community is a
result of the relatively few powers the student is yet
able to exercise and the fewer policies he is able to 1

effect.

The student finds himself bound by two major
limitations that the system unnecessarily places
upon him. He finds little continuity within his
student organizations. and there is no unit from
which the individual can exert legal pressure on
other divisions within the University and obtain

the results of his convictions.

The student who aspires to become involved in
his government rarely i." informed about the
system he wants to work in. The student who ends

his involvement seldom relates

about the system to the incoming student, and if
he does, the new student is not yet able to digest

the information relayed to him.

Consequently, over half of the students working
for their fellows do not know what they are doing;
they- are uninformed. The student must redo what

Creepy Christmas

I have been employed at
SUN‘.’A for over two years. I have
seen students daily for over two
years. I have been sworn at, litid
to and yelled at by some. Most
have been understanding and
considerate of the plight of a
secretarial position here,

In the two years plus I have
seen many items disappear from
my office and others on this floor.
Items that have been of obvious
value have been missing but more
important to the many employees
of SUNYA, items of personal ar.d
sentimental value are gone.

The secretaries here have
chipped in a few dollars each year
to build up our Christmas
decorations. Well, some little gem
fixed that last night by stealing all
the decorations off the doors on
the third floor of the Social
Sciences building. In addition,
name plates have been missing
from the doors.

What good a faculty member's
nameplate would anyone is
beyond me. Why anyone has to

stoop so low as to steal Christmas

decorations is even worse.

How ironic that someone
should steal two small angels.
What a brave and heroic thing to
do.I<‘rankly, this irritated me more
than any of the other items that
are missing.

I hope that whtiﬁi't‘r b'l-Ult‘ ll"?

To the Editor,

Since Sunday, Dec. 8, we have
been unable to live in our room in
Livingston ’l‘owcr. We have moved
our mattresses into the other two
bedrooms in the suite and are now
sleeping and studying there. The
reason for this is that our room is
without heat, not just
uncomfortably chilly-tho radiator
is stone cold. The temperature is
40 degrees, the windows are

coated with ice. We have tried to
get some action through normal
channels and have been told
everything from "the windows
need caulking" to “the pipes are
frozan." Somehow we get the
impression we’re supposed to fix
it ourselves.

We have now been advised that
the problem is incurable and that
we had better buy a baseboard
heater. There in no one now sick
in our suite. but we can't help but
feel that our days are numbered.
Perhaps this is one way to solve
the overcrowding problems in the
dormitories, by freezing as out.
But we still have to live here for
the rest of the year, and that
means the rest of the winter.
There are other suites in this
Tower with the same problem. We
ﬁnd it evtremcly difficult to exist
and to study under these
conditions. We also find them
totally unjustifiable. We are, in
short, thoroughly disgusted.

 

Sincerely ,,

S. Feueratein

For the next few weeks, we
shall all be subjected to a verbal

armada of “good will" and
“ Christian charity.” It is a
paradoxical phenomena, this

outﬂow of lofty expressions and
fine instincts, when measured
against mankind's greatest failure;
namely, the rejection of the
religious spirit.

After all, it is the religious spirit
(not religion) which rejects war,
while men glory in it; the spirit
which rejects materialism, while
men glory after it; the spirit which
upholds non-violence and love,
only to see men knock them
down.

Indeed, wherever one may
look, in times past or present, the
spirit of love, peace, or
brotherhood, can nowhere bu
found.

One of the greatest sinners is
our own society, the America of
the present. You need not even
look at Vietnam or racism to
discover this undeniable fact. All
you need do is look at yourself.

The student, alleged leader or
supporter of the love revolution
and the drive for
justice-for-all-men, may easily be
placed with the great pretenders
of American society. His devotion
to the University is reliant on his
wish to get-in-the-groove, or else
get-a-job. He is as quick to hate,
and as prone to indifference, as
are his parents.

K.

If he be one of those rare
involved students, his motives are
usually egotistical, his sentiments
childish, his reason faulty, and,
recently, his tactics unworthy of
his goals. His actions normally
consist of verbal noise or an
occassionai march, nothing that
would ruffle his feathers. _

The student’s excuse is that he
is a product of his society. In this
he speaks truth, for America is
surely the land of plenty where
men can kill each other to get
more. America is the great melting
pot, provided you are not a
Mexican, Indian, black Catholic,
Jew, or communist. it is the
peace-loving nation where
violence comes in assorted
panavisions nationally, and is
exported, recently in the form of
30,000 young lives, overseas.

The sad truth is that
Christmastime verbiage is verbiage
only. It matters not how much is
sincere, for sincerity of mouth is a
poor substitute for action. indeed.
if for every kind word uttered a
reality had ensued, we would
today be men of peace.

Failing peace—outwardly in a
Vietnam or Biafra, and inwardly
in peace of mind-—what can one
do? If you be a man, nothing; but
if you be a poet, like (5.0.
Cummings: “. . . listen: there’s a
hell of a good universe next door;
let‘s go.”

TUESDAY, DECEMBER 17, IBGE ALBANY STUDENT PRESS
l by Ray Bertrand
The pressing issues of the day four years? election.

once again receive a scrutinizing
analysis as the pertinent questions
demand their usual impertinent
responses.

Q. I couldn't help but notice
the extremely high percentage of

Eisenhower men in President
Nixon's cabinet. Can you
comment?

A. Apparently the new Nixon
has had trouble finding new
friends.

Q. What is. “law and order
tempered with justice?"

A. That’s when one cop hits
you over the head while his

partner reminds you of your
rights.

Q. Under Mayor Daley, do
Chicago citizens have problems'.’

A. None that they‘re allowed to
complain about.

Q. Why did George Romney,
governor of a large,
influentialstate like Michigan, quit
his post for a low spot on the
Nixon team?

A. Romney feared that he
wouldn't be re-elected when his
term expires in 1970. He was
disliked for the poor job he was
doing in the fields of housing and
urban development.

Q. What should be done about
Eldridge Cleaver, who killed an
officer of the law'.’

A. They should let him go if he
says he’s sorry.

Q. Nixon says that Agnew is
“cool under pressure." What do
you think?

A. I really can't say. But we all
know how he acts when the
pressure is off.

Q. You supported the
Nixon-Agnew team. Will you
continue to do so over the next

 

  

Taxes keep rising, and inflation
is shrinking the dollar. Part of the
reason lies with Congress.

In the affluent society on
Capitol Hill, $20,000-a-ycar jobs
are commonplace. There are close
to 500 of them ranging from
$28,500 paid to the head
doorkeeper of the liouse-ronly
$1,500 less than a member of
Congress gets!

While Congress talked the last
few years 0." whittling down the
Great Society programs, over-all
payroll costs have skyrocketed
84% in the House and 53% in the
Senate in the last six years.

Did you know that the [loose
postmaster with less than 100
million pieces of mail to deal with
yearly makes $500 more a year
than the postmaster of Chicago,
who is responsible for 0.0 billion
pieces of mail. And the Senate,
with less mail, pays its postmaster
$1,000 more than the postmaster
gets in CleVeland, where the mail
runs to 1.8 billion. pieces.

Fell by nearly annual pay
raises, protected by pnlronagc and
all but screened from public view,
the fat salaries have spread a» ross
Capitol Hill.

How would you like to be lhc

Senate chaplain, who reads a lnicf

prayer to open each session, and

1237 Western Ave.

 

   
 

A. Yes, to the grave.

Q. Is the “new morality"
responsible for nation’s
problems?

A. Offhand, I'd say it was the
old immorality.

Q. You don’t have any qualms
about having supported Nixon?

A. It’s funny you ask (at least I
hope it will be). During the
campaign, like all my compadres,
I was chanting “Nixon’s the one,
Nixon's the one!" Now after he's
been elected I ask myself
“Nixon'x the one for what?"

Q. Now that Johnson is leaving
the White House, what can we
expect‘.’

A. "Now that
leaving the White House .
Sounds good, doesn’t it?

Q. Why don't you ever cut
down deGaulle'.’

A. He's doing a good enough
job of that for himself.

Q. Do you hate Jews'.’

A. Not anymore than 1 hate
anyone else.

Q. What is bureaucracy?

A. Bureaucracy is when you gel.
into an auto accident, and two
months later you receive a letter
telling you that you’ve suddenly
become too dangerous to drive.

Q. Should Nelson Rockefeller
be disappointed over not having
secured a cabinet post?

A. Of course not. Had he been
appointed, he wouldn't be able to
assure the citizens of New York
that he has no intention to run for
the presidency in 1972.

Q. Will Nixon keep his word
about attempting to abolish the
Selective Service?

A. Don't be foolish. Why
should he keep his word‘! Don't
forget, pal, he’s already won the

the House chaplain, who gets only
$15,500.

if you're not a religious person,
maybe who would like to call or
record the roll, and make
$19,200. Or record debate and
make $22,000.

if you‘re not too bright, but
have good connections, you could
be a messenger for $10,000 or an
office worker for $12,000.

The beauty of these jobs,
besides the pay, are the hours.
Only four days a Week, and only

when Congress meets (this
excludes the members' own
staffs).

The legislative committees are a
major source of the $20,000 and
up jobs. There are lilll 0.” them on
Senate committees, 7‘.) on House
committees and 1.1 on joint
committees.

While each Ilouse member is
entitled to pay one staffer in his
office at the top rate of $20,850,
only one out of four actually do
so. In lhe Senate, which has
higher allowances, 100 aides get
more Lian $20,000. In addition,
the Senate itself has 25 top jobs,
such as secretary, purlimcntarian
and sergent-utarms, paying more
than $20,000, and the House has
seven.

Q. How do you feel about it?
A. You know I can’t stand it.

  

‘In defence of Ebencezer

Scrooae’
The perennial plot to subvert

America has once again seeped
into this fine institution. But
never before has this plot been so
blatantly perpetrated as in this
year ’9 Reader '5 Theater
production of Dickena'
“Christmas Carol." Despite
Stratton Rawson '5 fine
performance we cannot overlook
the subversive propaganda that

[unﬁt/e lien 0n damper

by JIM SMALL

 
 

the audience IO naively took in.

 

I had considered using this
space for a statement on the
idiocy of gluttony as a symbol of
Thanksgiving, but this being my
last time around before Christmas
I decided on something else.

In keeping with the
contemporary feelings in the
world, and the upcoming

holidays; I am passing to you a
part of Mark Twain's The War
Prayer.
“0 Lord our Father,
our young patriots,
idols of our hearts,
go forth to battle-
be Thou near them!
With them, in spirit,
we also go forth
from the sweet peace
of our beloved firesides
to smite the foe.
O Lord our God
help us
to tear theirsoldiers
to bloody shreds
with our shells;
help us
to cover their smiling fields
with the pale forms
of their patriot dead;
help us
to drown the thunder
of the guns
with the shrieks
of their wounded,
writhing in pain;
help us
to lay waste
their humble homes
with a hurricane of fire;
help us
to wring the hearts
of their unoffending widows
with unavailing grief;
help us
to turn them out roofless
with their little children

to wander unfriended
the wastes

of their desolated land
in rags and hunger

and thirst,

sports of the sun flames
of summer

and the icy winds

of winter,

broken in spirit,

worn with travail,
imploring Thee

for the refuge of the grave
and denied it-

for our sakes

who adore Thee, Lord,
blast their hopes,
blight their lives,
protract their

bitter pilgrimage.

make heavy their steps,
water their way with
their tcars,

stain the white snow
with the blood

of their wounded feet!
We ask it, in the spirit of love,

of Him who is the Source of Love,

and Who is the ever-faithful
refuge and friend

of all that are sore beset

and seek 1-1is aid with humble

and contrite hearts.

This was the unspoken prayer
that the messenger from God read
in the people, and vocalized for

them.

“it was believed afterward that
the man was a lunatic, because
in what he

there was no sense

said."

think about all of the times that
you have thought or uttered a

destructive prayer.

Now, go with good grace. “lid

have a happy holiday.

 

The Next Issue of the ASP
Will Appear on Feb 7,1969

 

 

For what has long been thought
of u a simple and saccharine

.chlldren‘s story is in reality a plot

by three great Northeastern
liberals (in the symbolic guise of
the ghosts of Christmas past.
present, and future-and this
symbolism is irrefutable for who
can doubt that three ethcral
beings who constantly haunt the
conservatives into freely doling
out their hard earned each, are
any other than Nelson
Rockefeller, John V. Lindsay, and
M.J. Rosenberg) to brainwash all
of us into believing that giving is

virtuous and that the Christmas
spirit will save us all. You have
also probably made the
connection that Charles Dickens is
only a pen name for John
Kenneth Galbraith whose ulterior
motive is to indict those who
hoard money.

Now we are liberals, but we do
not like the idea of the ghosts
shoving liberalism down Scrooge’s
throat by utilizing Communist
scare techniques and petty stage
tricks; and further we do not feel
that the virtuous side of Scrooge‘s
personality was accurately
portrayed. in fact we would go so
far as to say that Scrooge’s civil
liberties were indeed violated.

Scrooge's two greatest virtues
are that he is consisten and spends
money only on essentials. Scrooge
is consistent in that his actions are
always predictable and he can be
counted on to come
through—unlike certain Univeristy
Presidents who guarantee no
over-crowding and adequate dorm
space in the years to come. (After
all, Cratchit could always count
on two coals in his fire whereas
we are promised ten and
guaranteed none.)

in addition Eb never spent
money on non-essentials—sure he
was a little tight with his money,
but you never saw him going out
and buying a field house when he
needed books in his library. He
was also very efficient, for you
never would find Ebenezer
Scrooge losing money on a
monopoly as certain bookstores
do.
We hope that next year
Reader’s Theater will present the
other view by reading Winnie the
Pooh, which as we all know is H.
L. Hunt’s attempt to make obese,
lazy, bourgoise, financially
independent characters like Pooh
loved by all.

Over the holidays keep this
proverb in mind: “Don't spit
inthe plumb pudding, we all have
to choke on it." Or as Tom Lehrer
put it, "be thankful it only comes
once a year."
