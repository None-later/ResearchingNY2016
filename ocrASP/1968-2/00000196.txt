Mary

Mary Ellen Smith, who is 18
years old and has recently won
the Grand Prize in the 1968
National Finals of Sound of
Youth. will be appearing at the
University from January 13—18 as
part of the continuing series of
entertainers provided by the
Coffee House Circuit. Miss Smith
will perform Monday—Thursday
at B and 9:30 p.m. aan
Friday-Saturday at a, 9:30. and
11 pm.

Kudos

After her performance at the
State University at Prrtsdam. the
school wrote the New York
Coffee Circuit a letter saying that
they “hope the rest of the Coffee
House Circuit performers are able
to maintain the high quality
standard of performance which
Mary Smith disolavcd.“

High Attendance

Clarkson College reported that
Mary “was the perfect person to
initiate the Coffee House
Program. Everyone loved her." St.
Lawrence University had similar
remarks, reporting that the
general audience reaction was
excellent with nightly attendance
around 200.

Smith To
Coffee House

Mary signed with the Coffee
House Circuit to break in an act
and meet the students in colleges.
She believes that today’s youth
"are a group of young men and
women who like to do their own
thing. in their own time. and in
their own way."

She feels that free poetic lyrics
set to melodic music is the
strongest growing trend in pop
music. In her opinion the Beatles
have most influenced the pop
music field. however, no one
person. but a rombination of
many different people hrrve
influenced her own performing
style.

Childhood

Mary spent most of her
childhood in Flint, Michigan,
where her crrreer began at the age

'ght. By the ti e Mary was

Minsk): Movie:

Uproarious Fun

by Doug Wager

Not to be missed on the new
movie scene is the new United
Artists film “The Night They
Raided Minskys." The film stars
Jason Robards, Britt Eckland. and
the late Bert Lahr. It concerns the
latter years of the burlesque in
New York City in the 20’s.

The film is a prime example of
Aristotilian unity. It takes place in
a 24 hour period, at the same
location and concerns one master
plot. Besides this it is uproariously
funny. The plot itself is very
stock; young girl from an Amish
farm comes to the big city to be a
dancer. She is taken advantage of,
disowned. rind learns the true way
of the world. What makes this
film a gem is that instead of hiring
arbitrary extras, the film uses real
people. not actors. Some of the
candid shots in this film are
priceless pieces of real human life.
No one actor dominates the film
so that a new perspective is gained
from the film. You see real
burlesque, with its vaudvillian
humor: its plump dancing girls. It
is a backstage—front stage view
that doesn‘t become a
personification but a reproduction
of a time past.

By using novel photographic
techniques such as aging the film
to make it look old and washing
in with colors the movie creates
the antique atmosphere necessary
to make it believable. There are
shots taken through different
textures of cloth, and some fine
color~black and white
overlappings.

I attended a preview of the film
in New York. and after the film I

 

interviewed Miss Britt Eclrland,
the heroine of "Minskys." She
revealed the fact that Bert Lahr
had the major role of the film, but
he died halfway through the
shooting period. With the scant
clips of film they had, the
producer. Norman Lear. and his
staff proceded to insert these clips
of Lahr throughout the film,
diminishing his part and keeping
his character alive. This is the
major reason why no one
character stands out in the film.
She also mentioned that working
with Jason Robards was a "dream.
I love that man."

With all its realistic impact.
“The Night They Rrrided
Minskys" should not be missed by
anyone who enjoys a thoroughly
laughable movie.

The pass-fail system has been
introduced with highly successful
results at many colleges and
universities. One such institution
is Santa Cruz University. which
began to use the system from the
time it was established. Santa
Cruz graduates have been
accepted at Harvard. Yale and

Games lithium—ﬁe
trial Psych.

{In Indus

by Barbara Heyne- 1
Staff Reporter

“Games” have replaced
textbooks in an Industrial Social
Psychology course taught by Dr.
Joseph Steger of the Psychology
Department. Dr. Steger takes
examples from tests and studies in
this field and allows students to
act out the experiments to get
their own results. In this way has
has tried to simulate business
conditions in the classroom as
they exist in the business world.

A recent project of the class
was a "game" in which students
were responsible for creating and
managing businesses. Each of the
business concerns consisted of a
president, an accountant. a
manager and workers.

Representing the consumer
market. Dr. Steger played the role
of buyer and seller, thereby
controlling activities of all
businesses. Companies competed
in the manufacturing of a
representative product, numbers.

The test was to see which
omprrny made the highest
profits. The more novel a
presentation each company was
able to offer, the higher price

their product gained in the
market.
Dr. Steger has been

approaching the course in this
manner for the past three years.
“Students can't tolerate any
ambiguity, and management
introduces this ambiguity," stated
Dr. Steger.

Students are forced to structure
the business situation, they have
to make decisions and react,
Noting that students may be
passive in lectures, Dr. Steger said.
“It gives them a chance to see the

things we talked about in class."

The rules of the game
correlated to those found in
business. Each worker could be
either a paper cutter or a
numbermaker. To advance to a
higher position he could go to
college which means sitting out of
the game for 30 minutes.
Companies had to ensure
employee satisfaction. Some tried
music during working hours as an
incentive, others tried candy.

Students quickly realized that
the point of the game was to
make the greatest profit as
cheaply as possible. This meant
presenting the market with the
best advertisement, producing the
product most efficiently,
eliminating wasteful production.

One student commented that
the experience made him realize
how much was involved in an
actual business situation. Each
company member had to react
quickly and utilize all his
capabilities to keep ahead of the
competition. Originality was
required to create novel means of
advancing the product.

"If you turn college students
loose, it's amazing what they do,"
commented Dr. Steger. He noted
that student reaction ranges from
those who become extremely
involved in the games to those
who withdraw. "They can’t
tolerate confusion,“ concluded
Dr. Steger, “which is the point. of
the game."

Dr. Steger believes that
students are forced to plrt into
effect what they have learned by
such games. Each year that he has
taught the course, the games have
