Commission of Government
(FSC) on December 13. The vote
was 6 to 1 in favor of STD,
with one abstension.

This is the second time that
STB has tried to gain accept-
ance as a fraternity. Last
Spring, one semester after they
had broken away from SL8, STB
was turned down by FSC, re-
p-prtedly for violations in rush-

g.

Because STB was the last re-
maining men's colony on cam-
pus, the Greeks feel that new
colonies may be desirable. Any
group that wishes to become a
colony can contact Mike Shien-
wold for information.

There is a new women's col.-

GABERATION News Service)—
A counselling service to give
advice to college dropouts and
potential drop-outs is being or-
ganized by the New York regional
office of Students for a Demo-
cratic Society. _

The purpose of the program is
to acquaint young people with the
various ways they can lead con-
structive lives outside of the
"establishment," including the
world of academia.

it will also provide realistic
information abouttheproblemsef
financial support, alternative
jobs and life style changes.

The counselling service is ex.-
pected to offer clear, intelligent
information and advice, rather
than get into the "therapeutic"
bag, according to Jonathan Ler-
ner, who is organising the pro-
gram along with Michele Clark.

Jonathan and Michele expectto
set up a network of counsellors
in key college communities. This
organisation was expected to
emerge from the National Coun-
cil meeting of SDS in Blooming.

Dr. Tivor Baranski, secretary
oi the Hungarian Freedom Figh-
ters' Society oi America, spoke

L, last December 14, oi his person-
. al experiences under Hungarian

Communism. His lecture on-
titled, "The Evils of Commun-
ism" was sponsored by the Young
Americans for Freedom chapter
of the University.

Daranskl urged all Americans
to fight the Communists by "word
and sword until the final victory
to free the people who are burn-
ing behind the iron Curtain."

He recalled several terrible
experiences the Hungarian peo-
ple suffered in what he diag-
nosed as a “less and less human
society." He spoke of the women
and children raped and murder-
ed by the Communists "dogs and
rascals."

Moreover, the speaker termed
Comm m the "great social
disease," since this system of
regimentation has turned men and
societies into animals, scoun-
drals, herds and gangs."

Baranski denoted Communism
as “animal-life and puppet-life”
in conflict with the Judeo-Chris-
tian viewpoint which emphasises
"human life based ondivine prin-
ciples.”

Initial RespOnse

To Choice ’68

s Favorable

A collegiate presidential pri-
mary involving nearly 2500 col-
leges and several million
students, will be held simultan-
eously on campuses across the
country on April 24.

Leaders of student organiz-
tions at more than 200 major
universities have already asked
to participate in the vote. An-
nouncement oi CHOICE 68, Na.-
tional Collegiate Presidential
Primary, and an invitation to
take part will go out to 2200
additional colleges this week.

CHOICE 68 is being run by
a Board oi Directors composed
of eleven student leaders, each
from a different region of the
country. The Board is establish-

leaders has been highly favorable
according to Robert G. Harris,
Executive Director oi CHOICE

in addition to indicating their
choice of presidential candidates,
students will also have a chance
to vote on certain issues oi ha.-
tienal concern. The selection oi
these issues will also be made
by the Board oi Directors.

In its informational prospectus
on CHOICE 66, the Board ex,
plained the philosophy behind the
idea this way: "Never in the
nation's history have so many
college students been so well in-
formed about the major issues
oi the day. . .yet they have had
little opportunity toexpress their
views in a unified, coherentman-
nor. CHOICE 68 offers students
the opportunity to express their
preference on Presidential can-
didates and selected issues—

a body politic."

Faculty Members Organize Group
To Develop Draft Counseling

by Jill Paanik

A group of faculty members,
calling themselves a “Teachers
Draft Counseling Committee,"
have decided to assume the re-
sponsibility for making our cam-
pus aware oi the drait options
available in addition to those rec-
ommended at the military re-
cruiting desk.

These teachers were disturb-

ed te discover that there is no
place in our University commun-
ity where a student can get de-
tailed information or counsel-
ing to make an informed decision
concerning his draft options.
' The Teachers Draft Counsel-
ing Committee recognizes that
many of our young men ques-
tion whether or not they can,
as a matter of conscience, serve
as soldiers in the Vietnam war,
and further, that, under condi-
tions imposed by the draft law,
the choice oi service, alternate
service, or non-service re-
presents, for many, a serious
choice about life goals, and for
others, a far reaching personal
crisis.

The Committee takes the posi-
tion, therefore, that, as teach-
ers and responsible members of
the adacemid community, we
must help such young men ob-
tain information on all alterna.
tives and examine their own
feelings to the end that they
arrive at a rational and emo-
tionally satisfactory devision
about their role, if any, in the
Vietnam war.

The group agreed to begin
to train themselves as draft coun-
selors. Included in this commit-
tee are: Warder Cadbury, Gloria
DeSole, Peter Larrick, Dr.
Thomson H. Littlefield, Frank
Snow and Harry Staley with John
Reilly as its chairman.

About forty faculty members
met Monday, December lBthwith
local attorney Margrethe Pow-
ers whose information on
procedures for counseling con-
scientious objectors, it was
felt, would be of aid to the poten-
tial counselors.

Powers stated that the limits
of the law concerning draft coun-
selors allows only "The givingef
factual information. There is no
legal opposition to counseling,"
except for “counseling to disobey
the law.”

When asked what the best time
to apply for a C0 deferment is
for those whose present classi-
fication is ZS, she replied that
they would have to write their
local boards as soon as their
minds are clear. She said that
under the present interpretation
of the law a boy who has not seen
other were and opposes only this
war but not necessarily More
or past wars would not qualify
for a CO deferment.

Concerning the question asked

on form 150 (form for conscien-
tious objectors) -Do you believe
in a Supreme Being?, Powers
stated that if you do not know
if you believe, check yes. She
strongly suggested writing
"everything in duplicate, make
copies and send everyan by
registered mail.

“Fill out the form adequate-
ly, have witnesses available for
any hearings. The board may re-
fuse to listen to them, make a
record." Having a record of
everything involved in the ap-
peal is, Powers indicated,
of great importance. The appeal
candidate must have a thick
enough file in support oihis case.

“The poorest time to appeal is
after you receive the induction
notice." If the candidate appeals
at this time, Powers said, he
would have to show that “some-
thing beyond his control clunged
his mind after notification."

The faculty members were told
tlmt it is their "duty to assure
yourselves you are counseling
someone who really wants to do
this. You can't (under the law)
counsel them (students) to go to
Canada or break the law. You
are here and respected, lend-
ing your moral force" as teach-
ers to counseling.

Asked how government of-
ficials would find out if coun-
selors advised against the law,
Powers answered that the boy
"might get caught on his way to
Canada and say something, he
might be disturbed, or his par-
ents might say something. As
counselors you are public and
acknowledged; your name would
be on references.

“The CO applicant must be
reasonable. One of the ques-

Ambassador Plan
In Final Stages

The Student Ambassador pro-
gram at the University is in the
final stages of selecting repre-
sentatives for this summer's pro-
gram.

Applications have been review-
cd and the applicants are going
through a series of screening in-
terviews. Those selected will be
announced early next semester.

Students selected will spend
three weeks living wltlla family
in the country of their choice
as goodwill ambassadors. They
will speak the native language.
Language training can be receiv-
ed prior to the trip in Put-
noy, Vt.

There is he initial cost to
the student. The University as-
sumes the cost. Funds will be
raised by soliciations from so.
rarities, fraternities, and other
organisations.

tions that may be asked (of the
applicant) is Do you believe in
a police force? He must know
in his own mind the difference
between police and the military,
war and violence; he must have
his answers thought out."

During the time between the
appeal and the hearing the CO
candidate, advised Powers,
should get as much into his file
in support of his case as he pos-
sibly can. "If you get a mill-
tarist to vouch for your sin-
cerity" it would be a great help.

One question asked of the ap-
plicant may be whether he laid
ever done anything else on the
groImds of conscience. "If he
marchrd on Washington or join-
ed any Peace Vigils, get it on
file. The Draft Board will have
to make a case against you"
and with this support on file
it will make it harder for them
to win their case.

Peter Pollack, editor of the
Albany Liberator, has been is-
sued a CO classification; he was
asked some questions by the
group of faculty members. Pol-
lack said he was asked by of-
iicials if he would have fought
during World War 11.

His answer was tint he “could
not make judgments on the actions
of nations in Meterical setting."
He told his interviewers that
he “could not go back and say
what he would do under differ-
ent circumstances. His views,
he told the appeal board, had

Poolroom Open

In CampusCenter

The long awaited opening of
the poolroom in the Campus Cen-
ter is almost here. Mr. Nelson
Swartz, head of the poolroom,
feels that it will open in a few
days.

There were several obstacles
preventing the opening. Initial-
ly, the equipment was not order-
ed proporly. When the right equip-
ment came there were not enough
men from AMF, the manufactur-
er, to assemble the tables.

The largest obstacle, how-
ever, was the failure of the State
Inspection Bureau to accept the
work. The Bureau lute finally ap-
proved the tahles after many in-
spectlons.

The University has signed off
to AMF and there is nothing
foreseen to prevent the open-
ing of the poolroom.

The charge for the tables is
90 cents for an hour. One or four
people may use the same table
for the hour.

The hours for playingare Mon-
day-Thursday, IO a.m. - 5 p.m.,
'l p.m. - l1 p.m., Friday, 10
a.m. to l va.m.; Saturday i2

Coffee hours are also on the
agenda. At these informal gath-
erings club members will pre-
sent various programs related
to their own particular country.
At Easter time the Club also
plan: to show slides of the Holy

Seminars and debates will be
an important activity in which,
it is hoped, Arab and non-Arab
students may be able to discuss
matters of mutual interest. The

Granted Waiver

Madame Catherine Wolkonsky,
professor of Russian langmge
and comparative literature at
the University, again ins been
granted an extension of waiver
of the manthtory retirementpro-
vision by the Board of Trustees
of State University of New York.

The action permits an addi-
tional year of academic service
by Mathme Wolkensky who is
'12. The noted autlwrity on the
Russian language has beengrant-
ed three waivers of theprovision
won the recommenation of
President Evan R. Collins.

Her current waiver expires
next June. Formerly chirman
of the Russian departmentati
ear College, she came to the
University four years ago.

The request for her continued
service noted that Mamme Wol-
kensky is "still the mainstay of
the Russian part of the depart-
ment oiGermanicandSlavic lang-
uages and literatures."

Mamme Wolkonssy is co-
author of the book, “A Diction-
ary of Russian Roots." Theworir
is widely considered to be a
definitive study of the struc-
ture of the Russian language.

Ecological Researchers

To Study Whiteface Mt.

Dr. Jon T. Scott, professor of
earth and atmospheric sciences
at the University, and Dr. J.
Gary Holwsy, professor of
science at Oneonta State and an
alumni of the University, will
direct an extensive study of the
vegetation, soil, and microcli—
mate of Whiteface Mountain in
the Adirondacks.

The research project entitled
"Vegetation - Environment Rois.
tions at Whiteface Mountain in
the Adirondacks" will yield in-
formation fer forest management
and conservation practices inthe
Adirondack Forest Preserve.

Dr. Scott is an atmospheric
scientist with particular interest
in ecological studies, the rela-
tion of vegetation to the envi-
ronment. Dr. Holway, abotanical
specialist in ecology, will re-
search mainly in the area of
vegetatlenal structure.

The two - year investigation
seeks new statistical and mathe-
matical techniques for rotating
measures of vegetation to quan-
titative environmental measure-
ments. The team will also de-
scribe the vegetatien in an area
which has not been studied by

  
 

.q - .1

modern ecological methods.

The study will attempt to ob-
tain more information on a con-
troversy in the field of ecology
dealing with the structure of ve-
getation. Research will center
around the question, “Does vege-
tation consist of discrete units
or is it essentially continuous?"

While their conclusions are
highly tentative, Drs. Holwayand
Scott speculate that the truth
lies somewhere between the two
positions. The results, to date,
show features of both the ecolog-
ical hypotheses.

Smith 0n Council

Barbara Smith, a junior has
been elected to Central Coun-
cil from Colonial Quad. Only
about 60 students voted in the
election. The reason for the small
vote was the fact that the vot-
ing took place only in the Cam-
pus Center. Usually the elec-
tions take place on the dinner
lines, but because of complaints
of fraudulent votes the elections
were moved. Voting machines
were used for the first time.
