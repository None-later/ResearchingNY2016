foster child to the ASP since
Jan. '04.

She receives monthly eight

Sig Phi Sig Mixer Tonight,

Proceeds for

by Barb Gressmon

Deiinite engagements for
Greek Week entertainment have
not been made yet. The Facul-
ty student Association has
not met, and, therefore, the
Greeks have not received money
from them.

The money expected from
various beer companies has also
not come through. Consequently,
money is still needed for thebeer
party, the concert, and the guest
speaker.

Co-chairmen Linda Klein and
George Liebowitz have been
working to make definite engage-
ments, but the lack of money had
made the planning difficult.

However, preparations for
other Greek Week features, such
as the Olympics, the Follies, and
the Open House are going well.

There may be some hope yet

Greek Week

in obtaining funds soon enough
for Greek Week.Sigma Phisigma
Sorority is sponsoring a mixer
tonight from 9 p.m. to midnight
in the Campus Center Ballroom.
The mixer is intercollegiate and
RPl, Union, Albany Medical
School, Albany Law, and St.Rose
have been invited.

The band engaged to play is
the Soul Kitchen, currently play-

ing at Yezzi's and voted to play '

at the Dutch Quad mixer. Ad-
mission is 50 cents, and hands
will be stamped at the door to
facilitate leaving for snacks.

The money raised will go
directly into the preparations for
Greek Week, specifically thebeer
party and the engagement of a
speaker. There is also hope that
one or more of the other frater-
nities or sororities will be able
to contribute money for the con-
cert.

 
   

 

Dr. Paul Bacquet, visiting‘pro
fessor from the Sorbonne, spoke

I at the English Evening on Thurs-

December 14. ,
ills discussion centered around
“ An American Student in Paris”

‘ and dealt with many interesting

sidelights.
The University of Paris, the

~ Sorbonne, is the oldest university
‘ of its klnd,in Europe. It offers

an almost unlimited amount of
courses and excellent pro-
fessors, and nearly every foreign
l e.
mash Sorbon, it was origin-
ally a college for men who had
achieved the equivalent of a
Master of Arts degree, and who
wished to continue their study in
the field of theology. Even at this
time it was considered a
European center, and not merely
a French school, with adiversity
of students and professors. Situ-
ated in the center of the com-
mercial district, the university
bears the mark of belonging not
only to the city of Paris but also
the world. Dr. Bacquet added that
it has been called "the famous
monster which must be tamed.”

Student-faculty rapport is al-
most ncn-existant; professors
find themselves faced mainly by
American students; unaware of
their elders rather austere and
unapprcachable position.

The old system of education
was abandoned in 1966, and has
been replaced by a variety of
effective improvements. The
rather archaic structure of high-
er learning and the overcrowded

conditions‘ made such changes
necessary.

Enrollment for large lecture
sessions at the Sorbonne may be
twice the capacity of the class-
room. Students interested in the
lecture of a popular professor

must usually attendthe class held .

beforehand in the same room In
order to have a seat for the next
class.

University Plans
To Join Circuit

Plans are now being made by
the Campus Center Governing
Board for the University to join
the coffee House Circuit next

semester. This would mean night.

ly entertainment, Monday-satur-

day, in the Rathskeller oi the .

Campus Center.

The cost for joining the Circuit
is $200 and $150- $200 for each
group that entertains. The senior
class has already agreed to spon-
sor the first group, and the other
classes will also be asked to
participate in this plan. During
the week there will be two shows
nightly and on Friday and Satur-
day there will be three shows
each night.

Through their Coffee House
circuit, Sennet and Welntrauh,
owners of the famed Bitter End,
have made several professional .
and highly talented singers,

tainers available for one week

New Emphasis
In Outing Clubs,

“A good outing club shouldhea
team of first class woodsmen who
.can handle themselves in the out
of doors aswell as work harmoni-
ously together." (lOCA News-
letter 1949).

Although this definition of an
outing club is still true 20 years
later here on Albany's campug,
these is a new emphasis on

participation in intercollegiate '

trips.

in recent years, Albany Outing
Club enthusiasts have not only
traveled more extensively along
the eastern coast, but are shar-
ing the fun with more college
Outing Clubs.

For example, Albany woodsmen
have combined talents with such
American colleges as RPl, Union,
Vassar, University of Conn., Mt.
Holyoke, and University of Vir-
ginia for weekend trips.

_For winter ski trips, McGill

University in Montreal, Canada
lures many Northeastern IOCA
clubs to their slopes for a week-
end oi fun and relaxation.
, For newcomers, this emphasis
gives them more of a chance to
see the natural beauties of the
East coastas well as meet other
college students with common
interests.

Year-round activities include
anything from crawling around
unexplored caves of Knox Mt.,
canoeing on Lake George, or
mountain climbing in Mexico over
this recent Christmas vacation.

On Barring Recruiters

President Evan R. Collins re-
ed to an open letter ad-
dressed to him which appeared
in the Dec. 12 "Obiector," a
magazine serving as a forum of
opinion on Vietnam published by
the Faculty Student Committee
to End the War, at his Dec. 18
President's Conference With
Students.

The letter called for Collins'
immediate and public condemna-
tion of the actions of 0.8. Gener-
al Lewis B. Hershey which be-
gan with a statement issued by
gerehey to draft boards on Oct.

6

1t further called for condemns.-
tlon of the action by prevailing
upon Collins toban Armed Forces
recruiters from the campus in
order to demonstrate the Uni-
versity's disfavor.

Collins explained that he felt
there were two issues of concern
instead of what may have appear-
ed to be one from the context of
the letter. The first issue is the
public reaction and feelings about
the action taken by Hershey, and
the second issue lies in whether
or not the University should take
action against Hershey and osten-
sibly, the whole army.

He also stated that he felt that
from the beginning ofthe Hershey
incident he had offered public
comment on the situation. He
again cited his belief in support
for a 'Open University' and his
subsequent belief that the campus
should be open to all recruiters.

At that time he made comment
against Hershey's action which
would, in effect make the draft
a punitive organ by using it to
punish those demonstrating
against the draft, by changing a
persons draft status.

lie illustrated the concern of
not only himself, but of the other
Presidents of the University
Centers of the State University
System, by citing letters sent to
President Johnson and theJustice
Department expressing their con-
cept.

On Dec. 0, the four presidents
sent a letter as a body which
offered their commendation of
the J olnt Statement issued by the
Justice Department and The

Selective Service which insured
that constitutional guarantees of
due process would not be cir-
cumvented through administra-
tive proceedings taken by the
Selective Service.

The letter stated "We under-
stand that no sanctions, either
administrative or penal, will be
imposed t protest or dis-

again!
sent which is constitutionally pro- V
tected.

"We also understand that the
statement to insure that criminal
prosecution in the United States
District Courts . . . shall con-
stitute and sole sanction against
public protests or demonstra-
tions, and that administrative
proceedings shau under no cir-
cumstances be employed tostifle
or suppress opposition to the
Selective Service System. . ."

Later, on Dec. 15 the Presi-
dent again sent a telegram ex-
pressing their feelings that
although the Joint Statement had
provided enough assurance that
registrants "engaged in peaceful
demonstrations and other forms
of legal protest would not risk
criminal prosecution." "it failed
to give assurance that reclass-
ification or withdrawal of student
deferments for allegedviolations
of the Selective Service Act would
not be employed against protest-
ors on college and university
campuses.”

it went on to read that clari-
fication on the rights of students
is "even more urgent thanbefore
the issuance of the joint state-
ment. We seek assurance that no
sanctions will beimposed against
legal protest or dissent which is
constitutionally protected."

interpret the finding.

In this segment there will be
no point-count “Score.” Instead,
smokers and non-smokers will be

national sample to learn how
many people are In the same
category in which they findthem-
selves.
