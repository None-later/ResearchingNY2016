University Construction

To Finish More Phases

by Sandy Porter

Many phases of construction
on the University campus will be
completed during 1989 reported
Walter M. Tisdale, assistant to
the President for Plant Plan-
ning, in a recent interview.

The Physical Education build-
ing will be ready for use this
semester and that area will be
landscgped. The Computer Cen-
ter is also scheduled for aspring
opening. Early in the spring se-
mester the Administration Build-
ing will be occupied.

Podium landscaping is also
scheduled for thisspring. Flower
pots along the perimeter of the
podium as well as the east and
w_est podium courtyards are on
the work agenda.

Fulton and Irving Halls on
State Quad will be occupied next
semester completing the low rise
dorms on that quad and land-
scaping will be done. Eastman
Tower is scheduled for occu-
pancy by the summer of this

year.

Construction for thenew plane-
tarium on campus and lndian
Quadrangle will be begun this
spring. Both sites are slated as
the focus of attention for the
summer construction season.

The The r Music Building
will be completed and taken over
bv the University in the fall as
will the Instructional Resources
Center, in the middle of the

podium.

Bidding for the University's
Atmospheric Science Research
Center to be located on White-
face Mountain will be opened
late in the spring semester. Con-
struction for the center will be-
gin during the summer.

Sayles and Pierce Halls on
Alumni Quad willbe rehabillated.
These buildings, now in use as

Religious Group
Answers Needs

The Christian Science Organi.
zatlon was instituted by Arthur
Cornwall in 1944 to meet the
needs of the Christian Scientists
or those interested in Christian
Science within the University
community. This group directs
itself towards challenging the
aesthetic areas such as indi-
vidual's thoughts on meta-phys-
ical questions as existence.

Tuesday meetings, modeledaf-
ter the traditional Christian Sci-
ence Wednesday evening church
meeting are held weekly by the
Christian Science Organization.
These meetings focus on readings
from the Bible and the textbook,
Science and Health, With Key to
the Scriptures, by Mary Baker
Eddy.

The Christian Science Organi-
zation sponsors two lectures each
year. The first of this year'slec-
force, "The New Morality,“ was
given on Dec. 7, 1907, by Mrs,
Lenore Hanks.

v

residences and academic facili-
ties, are being converted tosole-
ly academic buildings.

With the completion of these
phases of the University's build-
ing project, plans for the future
are being made. Additiomlbulld-
ings on campus to meet the
various needs of the University
community are in the planning
stare.

Tentatively scheduled for com-
pletion in 1970 are 160 apart.
ments for married students. The
complex will be located on cam-

Pill.

New parking facilities are also
planned. The new structures will
be two levels of covered parking
with recreational and athletic
fields on the roof. The structure
planned for a site east oi the
Indian Quad is scheduled for com-
pletion in 1970. A second Phy-
sical Education building will also
be completed in 1970.

A multi-purpose auditorium or
field house seating 7500 people
is in the plans for 1971. The
structure will make possible a
continuous practice season for
all sports by, in effect, moving
the outdoors inside."l'he build-
ing will contain indoor practice
fields for the various sports.

Long range planning for the
Academic Podium includes ex-
tensions which would expand the
instructional space by fifty per-
cent. 'Ihe west podium extension
is scheduled for 1971 and will
be followed by a similar expan-
sion on the eastern end of the
podium.

Future plans also include astu-
dents residence complex for
single graduate students sche-
duled for 1971 on a site west of
the Colonial Quad.

Blood Shortage
AtAlbany Center

The Albany Blood Center has
a shortage of fresh blood dona-
tions. Dr. Albert H. Harris, the
medical director of the North-
eastern New York Red Cross
Regional Blood Program, said
many medical slhlations such
as, extensive surgery patients,
severe liver and kidney diseases
and hemophillacs, require the use
oi fresh blood, or components
that are present in blood for
only a short time after it is
collected from the donor.

Blood collected at the Albany
Center can be sent to the lab-
oratory to fractionate blood into
components but blood collected
at the bloodmobiles can't be de-
livered to the laboratory fast
enough for the process.

Carl H. Barley, Jr., administ-
rative director of the blood pro-
gram, said "But the Center is
our weak spot, we must get
more individual donors andmore
civic and fraternal and religious
organizations to schedule their

donations at e Center.”

Are you concerned about your
academic situation after your
first semester at the Univer--
sity? Is that 2.00 goal out of
your reach? Is it possible that
you may be on probation next
term, or even dismissed from
the University?

"Before contemplating any
drastic action," says Dean Rob-
ert Morris of the University
College, "see your Academic

‘ Advisor and discuss your prob-

lems thoroughly. Each student
is considered as aspecial case."

There is no low quality point
average that is a cut -off point
to separate those who are ex.
cluded and those who stay for
another term. The determina-
tion of probationary standing is
based on a Quality Point De-
ficiency, not a quality point
average. An explanation of the
idea of quality point deficiency
is in order.

It is the number of quality
points you must earn in a pro-
bationary semester to achieve
an overall 2.00 average. Dean
Morris used this example to
clarify quality point deficiency.

Consider the first semester
freshman who is carrying an
average 15 hour load of five
three-hour courses. He earns,
after his first semester, two
0’8 and three D’s or any equiv-
alent grade combination.

He would be placed on Aca-
demic Probation. in order to at-
tain a 2.00 average after his
first two terms, he would have
to earn three B’s and two C's
in his second semester.

The three B’s are mcesssrl'to
balance the three D's of the
first term represent nine qual-
ity points. These nine points
also represent his quality point
deficiency.

Your status in regard to aca-
demic or terminal probation de-
pends on the magnitude of your
duality point deficiency. Any
equivalent average below five
C's to three D’s and two C's
is the range of academic pro-
bation, in your freshman year.
You can go as low as one C
and four 0'5 and still be on
terminal probation.

Any average worse than one
C and four D's usually results
in dismissal after the first term
because the quality point defi-
ciency is considered insur mount-
able.

Academic probation demands
that you decrease your quality
point deficiency by a substan-
tial amount or erase it entire-
ly if possible in the subsequent
semester.

Terminal probation is much
more demanding. Its first con-
dition is that you pass all cours-
es. The second requirement is
that you reduce your quality point
deficiency by a specified amount
by doing a certain number of
hours of B work in your pro-
bationary semester. In both
cases, a letter from Dean Mor-
ris is sent to your parents out-
lining your probationary status.

A freshman at the University
has only-a 1.1 per cent chance
of being dismissed after one
semester, according to statis-
tlcs supplied by the University
College.

Fifteen students of the fresh-
man class last year were drop-
ped in January of 1967'after one
semester. 2.8 per cent or 37
students were placed on farm
lnal probation and 11.1 per cent
or 145 students warranted aca-

demic probation.

To put these figures into per-
spective: after the fall semes-
ter of last year, 15 students.
out of 1289 total in the fresh-
man class were dismissed and
192 students of 1289 were plac-
ed'on some type of probation.

if a student finds himself on
probation after this fall semes-
ter, he should not take his con-
dition lightly. Just because he
is on academic probation does,
not automatically mean that the
student still has terminal sta-
tus to fall back on. Also, do not
be surprised or discouraged if
your probationary situation lasts
over two terms.

Let's see what happened to
that select 182 after their sec-
ond semester last year. Of the
97 placed on terminal proba-
tion in January, 19 were dismisz
sed from the university in June.
Ten continued on terminal pro~
bation, 3 were removed from
terminal status, and 5 withdrew
from the University. That means
only 10 out of 37 maintained
their status quo, and only 3
of 37 improved their position
by June.

Consider the 145 who were
on academic probation after their
first semester. 26 students were
dismissed after one term of aca-
demic probation, 85 were reduc-
ed to terminal status, 46 con-
tinued on academic probation,
4 withdrew from the university,
and only 38 were removed from
probation.

These statistics show that of
the 182 on probation, 45 were
dismissed after a subsequent
term and 9 withdrew, which
makes a total of 54 of 182 who
after one term of probation are
no'longer with us.

What can you do if you are
dismissed? Your last chance
is to appeal to the Faculty Com-
mittee on Academic Standing,

Kosher Food Plan
To Be Available

A kosher food plan available
to students who have contracted
for food service, will begin next
semester. It was developed af-
ter consultation with represen-
tatives of the Hillel Society on
campus; and Rabbi Napthall Ru-
blnger, former advisor of Hillel,
who was authorized to convey
the opinions of the Capital Dis-
trict Board of Rabbis.

Frozen dinners, labeled with
'the "O"-"U"' symbol, signify-
ing certification as kosher, will
be served seven times each week
when standard dinners are serv-
ed.

These dinners will consist of
the entree only, generally in-
cluding a meat item and two
vegetables. As wide a variety
of food as is available for pur-
chase will be offered and will
include, insofar as possible, fish
once a week.

Students participating in the
plan will be offered the rogue
lar salad, beverage and dessert
on the menu. Participating stu-
dents will be offered the stan-
dard breakfast menu in the din-
ing rooms of their regular places
of residence.

Kosher dinners will be served
in the cafeteria of the Campus
Center. Students will not be as-
signed a special place for din.
ing but will use the regular
dining facilities in the Campus
Center,

The Hillel Society will take
responsibility for communicat-
ing needs to the University Food
Service, including providing: the
Food Service each session with
an estimate of the number of
students who are interested in
participating in the plan and rep—
reseniatlves on the Campus Cen-
ter Students Food Service Com-
mittee which consults with Food
Service personnel.

A participant is expected to
notify Food Service in advance
that he plans to be present for
a particular meal. The partici-
pants should, in consultation with
the Food Service, decide on a
time when the frozen food meals
will be available so that there
will be no unnecessary delays
in serving.

The cost per student is $50

for board for the second semes-
ter of the 07-08 academic year.

‘Pilgrimage’ Successful
According To Students

“The interfaith Pilgrimage
was very successful as 154 of us
carrying over $2,000 and 46 ofus
carrying packages of medical
supplies addressed to Red Cross
agencies and earmarked for the
relief of Civilian Casualties in
all parts of Vietnam crossed the
Peace Bridge into Canada.” The
statement was made by Carol
Cranch and Walter John Clark.

As part of the Interfaith Pil-
grimage they walked through
American Customs with packages
earmarked for Vietnam and were
warned of the illegality of their
actions. Some were asked to sur-
render packages but did not com-
ply with the wishes oi the of-
ficials.

As the group passed over the
Peace Bridge into Canada toward
Canadian customs they received
word that the Canadian govern-
ment reversed an earlier policy
and would now allow packages to
be exported from Canada for re-
lief of civilian victims in Viet-
nam. Canadian officials greeted
the pilgrims warmly, extended
New Year's wishes and aided
them in rewrapplng packages
opened for United States officials.
The group then proceeded to
Toronto to present the funds to
the Canadian Friends Service
Committee. The committee will
use the money for the relief of
suffering civilians in Vietnam.

During the course of the pil-
grimage several speeches were
delivered expounding the ideals
of the marchers.

Ross Flanagan, leader of a
Quaker Action Group spoke of
the reaction of the State Depart-
ment when it denied an applica-
tion for a license to take medical
supplies into North Vietnam.
Flanagan stated that he was told:
“It appears that you would place
yourselves above the President."
To this he replied, "It is not our-
selves, but our God whom we
would place above the Presi-
dent." To this he received the
retort, “Your conception of

0d."

Flanagan also commented on
the comparisons with Nazi Ger-
many and the biting question
'Where are the good Amari-
cans?’ He said the analogy for
our situation is one with the
biblical King Herod. Now it is a
jealousy for power which is ruth-
lessly seeking out the child of
revolution, he stated. The
message he had to give was that
the child of revolution could not
be destroyed by military force
but that violence could only be
avoided by ending the conditions
that are breeding revolutions.

Father McFoley followed
Flanagan's speech with the an-
nouncement that Pepe Paul V]
had given a personal gift of

$100,000 to CAIRITOS, aCatholic
international agency which will
use the funds for the relief of
suffering civilians in Vietnam.
McFoley Spoke of General West-
morelands request that Catholic
Charities in Vietnam provide ex-
tra food to the families of mem-
bers of the South Vietnamese
army. I

Rabbi Feinberg, who had visit-
ed Hanoi during the period be-
tween Christmas and New Years
during 1966, also spoke.

He expressed his delight at
seeing those who were willing to
violate the law of our nation to
affirm that "no human being is
our enemy." He commented that
man's true enemy is the de-
humanization of man, the grow-
ing acceptance of violence, and
the growing inhumanity that
Americans are willing to accept.

Feinberg stated that thepeople
of North Vietnam would “rather
die than surrender. The bombing
which is stiffening the resistance
of the North Vietnames pe0ple
should be immediately and un-
conditionally ended."

According to the Rabbi the
people perceive themselves as
fighting to maintain their own
independence. He had heardnoth-
ing of the preservation let alone
the spread of communism. He ex-
pressod his belief that the NLF
truly represents the interests of
the South Vietnamese and that
Americans must divorce them-
selves ”from that paragon of
democracy, the military junta”
that at present controls South
Vietnam.

The Rabbi spoke of the feel-
ings the Vietnames have for the
United States. They patterned
their Declaration oflndependence
after the United States document.
It begins with "All men are
created equal."

He called attention to the amaz-
ing inconsistency of the govern-
ment. It protested the North Viet-
namese government return of
gift parcels earmarked for
American pilots downed over
North Vietnamese territory as
inhumane. But the government
denied the civilians who are ac-
cldential victims of boming
medical old by prohibiting Ameri-
cans from sending such aid to
them by normal means.

Feinberg called those on the
pilgrimage who were willing to
risk the penalty of the state as
they attempted to show that their
love of mankind transcends na-
tional boundaries “the saving
remanent."

Rabbi Feinberg's words "lsee
by the headlines in this morning's
paper: “Westmoreland reports
progress 90,000 Enemy Dead.’
I trust you'll reject that definition
of progress. We want to see some
real progress," echoed through
the pilgrimage.

The new State University Col-
lege at Westbury will open in
September, two years ahead of
schedule, catering to a small
experimental group of students,
whose major goals will be di-
rected towards dealing with
“pressing urban problems."
Visions of the rolling hills of a
Long Island campus, fashioned
out of a plush estate, may appear
rather incompatible with an im-
age of the teaming slums. How-
ever, Harris Wofford, president
of the new college, defends his

I. plans in terms of Toynhee's idea

that you must "withdraw and re-
turn." He wants his new venture
in education to be " involved, not
engulfed," and feels that b

, situating the school outside of

the area in question, he may

ﬁt -' refreshing outlook. This is in

Opposition to the Lindsay ap-
proach, which views the univer-
sity as an imminent, on-the-spot-
partner ’ within the community.

on a recent Saturday, in con-
junction with a ﬂurry of Christ-
mas spirlt and the Smiles pro-
gram, a small segment of our
braver and more patient souls
entertained young visitors from
the South End of Albany. On the
surface the event appeared less
then excruiciating; the kids calm-
ly devoured refreshments, tore
upon their gifts, and proceeded
to race through the dorms for
two hours of pandemonium. But
there were some glaring ques-
tions which seemed toundermine
the festivities: Aren't we creating
a rather artifich situation when
we transport them into a different
world, feign interest in them for
one isolated afternoon and then
return them, dismissing their
problems with a sigh of relief,
patting ourselves on the back
with a false sense of benevolence?
The new Westbury campus bears
implications of the unfortunate
isolated - insulated status of the
majority of campuses.

Further consideration should
be given to the existing “ivory
tower" concept of higher educa-
tion. The "outside world" is a
rather formidable item which
we tend to overlook when we
become engrossed in personal
conflicts. It may be argued that
we owe ourselves the privilege
of‘golng beyond the fantasy-like
scope of undergraduate work and
involving ourselves in the reality

changed in college. “They seem-
ed to want to penalize me be-
cause I had not felt this way
since 1 was six years old.

“There were no questions,"
Pollack said, "as to supporting
activities" (such as Peace
marches.)

In the future the DraftCounsele
ing Group intends to formulate
a statement of purpose to which
they may apply statements made
by the President and act accord-
ingly.

Rain, Workers

Cause Fiasco

The urgent need for the move-
ment to change the consciousness
of the American working class he-
came evident at a recent anti-war
demonstration.

Rain began falling as an anti-
war rally was taking place on the
campus of the State University at
Stony Brook, so a janitor came out
to take down the US flag.

When a group of construction
workers on a nearby job saw the
flag being lowered, they assumed
the students were about todeface
it. So they rushed to the scene,
stomping on students, the janitor
and even some of the school ad-
ministrators.

us. A hackneyed position, per-
haps, but one that hasnot carried
enough strength. We possess an
unlimited stream of resources
and our position in society per-
mits us a headstrong, potent,
and flexible role. Yet scholastic
isolation itself, whether in Kala-
mazoo, Michigan, or Plattsburgh,

New York, stifles any hopes of.

creativity. There is also the
possibility of building a utopia
within the boundaries of a uni-
versity, encouraging a realistic
application to radiate into sur-
rounding areas. However, such
dreams rarely materialize.

While the City University is
pressing plans for a new four
year institution to be situated on
a scenic penlsula in Queens,
Mayor Lindsay prefers a more
realistic site in rundown South
Jamaica. He feels that this will
stimulate rebirth.

The Universities of Chicago
and Pennsylvania have become
city rebuilders, expandingener-
gies and expenses to meet the
challenge of urban renewal.
Vassar college will soon re-
locate in downtown Manhattan,
while N.Y.U. and Columbia are
considering suburban locations
for faculty and research, on-
couraging the "withdraw and re-
turn" theory. Another unit of the
State University in suburban
Westchester, hoping to admit stu-
dents in l970, will create an
active branch in Lincoln Center,
geared towards the Arts.

These basic differences will
not be easily solved. Should we
establish centers of education
within the ghetto, creatingalmost
a fortress of strength uponwhich
to base further growth, or should
colleges be situated beyond the
crucial areas to calmly plan
future strategy rather than in
the midst of the storm?

There seem to be many valid
reasons for establishing on-the-
scene-involvement. For instance,
Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania was
the scene of an effort begun after
World War II to revitalize a de-
pressed coal-mining community.
Wilkes College provided graduate
departments in various fields in
coordination with new labora-
tories offered by RCA. Acultural
and academic give-and-take en-
hanced both partners involved.

it is time that we correlate
the pressing, yearning demands
of urban slums with the equally
disturbing situation of "Peter
Pan" type institutions whose
“Never-neverland" approach
lead us only further astray. There
may be no answer to the ques-
tion of where new colleges should

be built if they are to tackle the
urban crisis. Universities can
fail in suburban pastures or on
low district street corners. The
challenge lies in not being obese-
ed with scholastic fields or non-
intellectual activism, and in en-
gaging in the urbanbattie for sur-
vial rather than becoming a cap-
tive in foreign territory.Centers
of higher learning must take into
consideration both components in
future planning, and integrate
inﬁrm into a feasible and effective
w o e.

MilitaryRccruiiere
Barred AT G.W.U.

All military recruiting on the
campus of theGeorge Washington‘
University was banned last week
in an order by university presh
dent Lloyd H. Elliott.

The action was explicitly in
response to Lt. Gen. Lewis G.B.
Hershey's letter to draft boards
urging punitive drafting for pro-
testors.

Elliott said that industrial re-
cruiters (such as the representa-
tives of Dow which produces
napalm used in Vietnam) would
continue to be welcome on the
campus.

David Guns, a spokesman for
the George Washington chapter of
Students for aDemocratic Society
(SDS) welcomed the actim but,
criticized Elliott for "handing
it on a platter." The way he did
it, Ganz explained, "the students
avoid responsibility for a de-
cision they ought to make."

Ganz said he felt the ban on
military recruiters would be
temporary, since Hershey's
stand is not likely to withstand
the attack on it.

Press Conf

(Continued from Pg. 1‘)

Formerly there were 6 uses
running as late as l a.m. and it
was felt by the Transportation
Service that there was not enough
demand for buses at these hours.

Contrary to public opinion Col-
lins commented that the new
change in scheduling was posted
before the holiday under glass in
the bus stops; he also remarked
that although other efforts were
made to post the changes, the
posters were rapidly stolen or
disappeared.

He commented that perhaps the
action has been too drastic on
the part of the Transportation
Department and that they are
presently reviewing the case to
see whether it would be possible
to operate one or two buses at
l a.m.
