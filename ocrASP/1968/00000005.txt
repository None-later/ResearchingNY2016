“The State University of New York at
Albany has long been dedicated to high
standards of intellectual excellence. its
methods are those of free inquiry, the
consideration of alternatives, and the mak-
ing of choices. In its human relationships
it provides for a maximum of individual
responsibility.

“The characteristics of the university
make detailed description of behavior un-
desirable and the tradition of freedom
places high value on the ability of the in-
dividual to make choices and determine
his own way of action.” 'Student Guide-
lines l967-68'; page 22; Part IV, Personal
Responsibilities; section entitled "Stan-
dards of Conduct."

All this may be true; however there is
one case of “human relationships" in
which the student is not permitted to make
his own decision, in the freedom to judge
for himself his conduct with guests of the
opposite sex in his own room during Open
House, or Open Room Visitation.

For “Guidelines” further outlines these
aspects of individual freedomsin Part Vii,

 

The formation of the new Teachers'
Draft Counseling Committee this week,
headed by John Reilly of the English De-
partment, merits the appreciation of the
University Community.

it is rewarding to us to think that these
individuals will give their time tolearnlng
to counsel others on the legal alternatives
to the draft.

it is important to realize that they are
not a lobbyist group, nor are they designed
to disseminate propaganda; rather they
see themselves as offerings "sympathetic
ear“ to those young men who are in doubt
as to what to do when faced withthe draft.

We have already stated our abhorrence

Moral Decision?

Sympathetic Ear?

  

Residences; section entitled "Residence
Guests,” No. 2, which specifies that “The
doors of bedrooms and studies remain
open during this time. In general, these
events last two or three hours."

it seems to us that this tacitly states
that there will be no heterosexual rela-
tions in anybody’s room, at any time, no
matter what, which is in effect a forced
moral decision. ‘

Violators of this ‘understanding’ will
undoubtedly fall under the section of
“Student Conduct,” No. 3; "Disorderly
or indecent behavior” subject to discip-
linary action by the University.

it seems to us that students, encourag-
ed by the University to' become adult
and individual in their own relationships,
should be allowed some privacy during
specified open houses.

The only people involved in any moral
decisions on the matter should be the resi-
dents having the same living quarters. it
should concern no one else. We hope this
policy will be abolished as soon as
possible.

 

for a policy which forces those people
morally committed against the war to
fight under conscription, especially when
this system becomes an unofficial punitive
organ. Unfortunately, when the time
comes, many young men are in doubtasto
their legal alternatives. The absence of
sympathetic aid is all too evident.

To make matters worse the Selective
Service has now formulated a new system
of graduate deferment which is not close
to being democratic.

We believo the nature of the war the
United States is presently involved in
merits this unwillingness on the part of
its young men, and support all attempts
to aid them.

Yet a legalized lunching of
five black students is the object
of a trial beginning in Houston,
Texas this week. The five have
been clurged with committing

murder, conspiring to commit-

murder and felonious rioting in
connection with events occurring
on May 16, 1967 on the campus
of Texas Southern Univer-
sity (TSU).

The Houston Police hope to
convict the five of murder and
thereby rid the city of “black
power advocates."

The "black power advocates"
in this case, members of a mill-
tant Friends of SNCC chapter,
had participated with other TSU
students in two protest activi-
ties that day in Houston.

It was the second day of a
demonstration protesting condi-
tions at a dump in the Sunnyside
section of the city. Residents
complained that obnoxious odors,
rats, smoke and raw sewage from
the dump permeated the commun-
ity. The residents with the aid of
TSU students attempted to block
the garbage trucks from enter-
ing the dump and Houston’s may-
or, Louis Welch, responded
by ordering police with dogs and
clubs to arrest the demonstrat-

ors.

TSU students were also in-
volved in a peaceful plcketing of
recently integrated Northwood
Junior High School in protest
to unequal punishment of black
students involved in a scuffle
with white students. 19 TSU stu-
dents were arrested by 200 Hous-
ton police.

A rally of about 125 students
was held on the TSU campus that
evening with students mapping
plans for further demonstrations.
Policemen who were “guarding”
the rally arrested a student who
they claim threw a watermelon
rind at their car for possession
of a concealed weapon. The

clergslster was dropped.

The police called in more pa-

trol cars and students began to
greet them with bottles and
bricks. :A temporary truce was
arranged and the police with.
drew. The students then bar-
racaded themselves from the po-
lice, blocking off Wheeler St., a
main thoroughfare which bisects
the campus and hssbeenasource
of conflict between students and
the city.
Hundreds of police returned
—the number was later estimated
at over 600. The students re-
treated to their dormitories and
over 5,000 rounds of ammunition
were fired wildly against the
buildings by police. in the pro-
cess, one student and one police-
man were wounded, another po-
liceman was hit fatally. .

The police rampaged through
the dorms, dragging students out-
side, beating some, abusing
many. In a supposed search for
weapons, they destroyed $15,000
of personal property.

The police arrested 486 stu-
dents and released all except
five. The five were held in jail
for more than a month before
they could post ball of $10,000.

The police foundthree guns, but
it was not reported whether any
of these had been fired. The
weapon(s) that police claim in-
jured the policemen have not
been found.

Of the five students held one
was in another part of the city
at the time. He and another stu-
dent were arrested the next day
as leaders of the SNCC group,
based on files kept by the lions-
ton police.

I feel none of these five men
are guilty of the charge of mur-
der or conspiring to commit mur-
der. Student witnesses maintain
that both policemen were hit by
ricocheting bullets. The stu-
dent who was injured was hit in

the back.

i feel also the five are not guilty
of inciting a riot. A report pre-
pared by the student council which
was refused as evidence by the
McClellan Committee stated that

COMMENT

by William M. Leue

 

 

ft is Very uker that this will
be the last semester of peace
and sweet reasonableness for
most large American universi-
ties. If the war continues to es-
calate, as it seems certain to
do, and if the vindictive, reac-
tionary, and evil old man who
heads the Selective Service
bureaucracy continues to mold
the Draft to implement his own
contempt for education and youth,
then the Spring of 1968 will
see an unparalleled outburst of
anti-war student demonstrations
both on and off campus.

The targets will be local Draft
Boards“ on-campus recruiters
for the Armed Service and de-
fense-oriented industries, and,
increasingly, the administrations
of the universities themselves.
it is also probable that most col-
lege administrations will re-
spond withincreased physical and
political repression. This is the
pattern being played out now at
Berkeley, where students show
almost complete solidarity be-
hind a demand for an end to
administration interference in
campus-based demonstrations,
and where their demands are
running head-on into a united
front of faculty, administration,
and California pollticans who are
equally dedicated to peace and
quiet at any cost. The likely
result, as an article in this
week's Village Voice prophe-
sized, is the destruction of the
University, whose morale has al-
ready been undermined by the
prospect of losing all its grad-
uate students next September.

The Berkeley pattern is, like-
ly to spread. With few encep-
tions, college administrations

and the majority of faculties
are not willing to participate in
the turbulent anti-war move-
ment if participation means en-
dangering any of the financial lar-
gess that is so amply showered
upon research-oriented schools
by government and industry. Ex-
cept for Harvard, Wayne State
University, and a few other in-
stitutions, college have been un-
willing even to take the purely
symbolic step of denying campus
facilities to military, CIA, or
defense industry recruiters.
Most administrations wrap them-
selves in the banner of “free-
dom of information," maintain-
ing the convenient fiction that re-
cruiting is purely an informa-
tional service, and therefore im-
mune from screening by the uni-
versity. (Would most universi-
ties tolerate recruitment for
prostitutes, drug pushers, or
maybe a student homosexual
club?)

The war in Viet Nam and the
Draft are forcing students to-
ward political uwureness at a
rapid rate. This awareness is
leading to action, which helps
to further polarize political opin-
ion within universities. The re-
sulting conflict can easily do-
stroy any college. At the pres-
ent time, college administrations
still have time to reexamine
their role as manpower suppliers
to the military4ndustrial com-
plex. They may even choose to
fight with their students against
American society’s suicidal rush
towards international violence.
But the time is short: the pas-
sage of events is rapidly hem-
ming in their freedom of ac-
tion. in time, the only role left
for them to play may be a re-
pressive and brutal one.

During the 1960s college cem-
puses the United
states were characterised by the
apathy of their students. Colleg-
iates cared little and knew little
about their political and social
environment. Because of this at.
titude, the American public sp-
pesled to college students to be-
come active and take an interest
in the forces that were going to
inﬂuence their lives, and indeed
the entire world. The responseto
this plea for involvement result-
ed in the emergence of student
demonstrations, committees and
clubs. Although this activist trend
is in many wnys beneficial, it
also contains certain dangers
which should be considered.

The greatest peril threatening
this student movement is con-
stituted by the extremist groups
who try to lure college students
into their grasp. The college cam-
pus is surrounded by an aura
of idealism and learning, and
many times is divorced from
reality. As a result of these
conditions, a college stu-
dent, who is at an impression-
able age anyway, might easily
be duped by extremists of the
left or right.

For instance, Communist
Party-USA has an extensive pro.
gram for recruiting and in-
doctrinating America's youth. J.
Edgar Hoover said, "The party
feels that our nation is witness-’
ing a new upsurge of leftist think-
ing among young people which
makes the Communist message
more palatable. The party, of
course, is exploiting this trend.”

To further emphasize the Com-
munist's desire to pollute and
exploit American youth is the
fact that during the academic
years from 1961-65 Communist

ht Way

 

speakers averaged to appear-
ances on college campuses. Dur-
ing the 1966-66 academic year
they spoke on 69 campuses.
However, the Reds are notcon-
tent to merely speak and leave.
In their wake they organizeCom-
munlst youth groups, and per-
suade other pre-eidsting organ-
izations to follow them. Some of
this Communist or Communist
affiliated groups are W.E.B. Du-
Bols Clubs, the Young Socialist
Alliance, Youth Against War and
Fascism, and Students for
a Democratic Society (SDS).
"This group (DuBois Clubs) to-
gether with other so called ‘new
left' organizations such as the
SDS work constantly in further-
ance of the aims and objectives
of the Communist Party through-
out the nation. Communist Party
Secretary Gus Hall described
these groups as part of the ‘re-
sponsible left’ that the party has
‘going forus.’ " (testimony -
House Subcommittee on Appro-
priations for 1968). ‘
lam not suggesting that every-
one cease from joining student
organizations. However, 1 do be-
lieve that it is essential that
you carefully investigate any
group you plan to join. It is in-
edded unfortunate when young
people who have legitimate
concern for the problems oftheir
country become involved with
subversive groups. As for the stu-
dents at the University, would
you join an organization (SDS)
that Gus Hall, head of the Com-
munist Party USA has describ-
ed as a group the party has
"going for us?" We must be
certain that in an effort to im-
prove ourselves and our system,
we are not blindly aiding an
idealogy which seeks to destroy
use and free people everywhere.

Vietnam Scene 4

Writes On

To the Editor:

Before entering into a dis-
cussion of the War in Viet Nam
which is based on my own obser-
vation, a few basic facts should
be brought out for founmtion.

Well we know tint our govern-
ment's purpose for fighting in
Viet Nam is “to protect the peo-
ple and government of South Viet-
nam from Communist aggres-
sion.” There are facts however
which make this purpose week
at best. .

—South Viet Nam was not in-
vaded by the North until after
the United States hadbegunbomb-
ing raids on the North.

—The Viet Cong are South
Vietnamese who began their re-
bellion against dictatorial gov-
ernments in their own country
and who are now fighting in op-
position to United States imper-
ialism.

These two facts alone are suf-
ficient to prove that the United
States is not fighting a war of
protection or liberation, but rath-
er one of intervention in a coun-
try’s domestic affairs.

Rebuttal for United States
policy: "The United States was
asked to intervene by the gov-
ernment of South Viet Nam" . . .
This is true, however, the Viet
Cong, being South Vietnamese,
were not and are not represent-
ed by the government of South
Viet Nam although they are citi--
zens, but in rebellion.

our administration has stat-
ed time and again that, "we want
nothing for ourselves in Viet
Nam" (i.e. we are not engaged
for imperialism). Here is where
direct observation of affairs in
Viet Nam are shockingly opposite
in their implications.

 

 

Off Center

by M.J. Rosenb‘erg

 

 

 

1966 is now upon us and it
already seems destined to be,
politically at least, a disaster.
Every major publication and
virtually every columnist in-
forms us that this November
the American people shall be
faced with a choicebetween Rich-
ard Nixon and Lyndon Johnson.
This is tragic as an electoral
contest like that can do more to
vitiate the Democratic process
than the fearedCommunists could
ever hope to accomplish in the
United States. Every public opin-
ion poll demonstrates that the
American people would like to
see a choice between Nelson
Rockefeller and Robert F. Ken-
nedy. The people neither like or
trust Messrs. Nixon and John-
son, but weAmericanshave come
to accept the idea that the bosses
and not the people choose our
leaders. I believe that we call
this the American political tra-
dition. And therefore we ac-
cept the alleged inevitability of
a Johnsond‘iixon race. More than
anything else, it is sad and dis-
illusioning.

Remember 1960? That was the
year that John Kennedy supposed-
ly ushered in a new era inAmer-
ican politics. He entered primar-
ies in twenty-five states and won
every one. And then he was nom-
inated, and his election proved
that a man could be elected even
if be challenged some of our
more cherished assumptions.
Maybe we should have known way
back then that the Kennedy exper-
ience was not to be the norm.
After all, even against so sterile
an opponent as Nixon, the Amer-
ican people only gave him 50
per cent of the vote. But it look-
ed as though a new generation
had taken over and that the "safe
mediocrity of the past" was not
301118 to be good enough. lnNo-
vember, 1962, all the talk was

about the Kennedy-Rockefeller
bout that was two years hence.
And Nixon was through. Ifthe
California defeat did not in it-
self destroy him; then his vindic-
tive and tearful concession
SWech did. And Lyndon Johnson
was buried in the anonymity of

the Vice-Presidency and he was
not expected to ever surhce.
This was to be a new day and
in the 19605 there was going
to be no room for the Nixons
and the Johnsons. November
22, 1963 changed everything. Not
only did we lose the manwho was
the greatest leader of the gen-
eration, but we seemed to have
lost our bearing too.

So now it seems as though we
have turned the clock back. The
resurrection of the_ Eisenhower
era is apparently complete. Un-
less there is a radical change in
the situation, we are going to
have to choose between Johnson
and Nixon.

And we are going to hear
them debate as to whichofthemis
more anti-Communist, more anti-

crime in the streets, more pro
“peace without surrender" and
more likely to create the moral
society. Unlike 1964 there is one
issue that will not arise; with
"Credibility Gap" Jolmson and
“C heckers" Nixon as candidates,
we shall not hear much about
integrity and honesty.

That's the way it looks at the
dawn of 1968. One had hoped
that the demonstrations and the
riots could end this year. One
felt that we could all put down
our placards and return to what
Governor Rockefeller calls "the
mainstream" of American de-
mocracy. it does not look as if
things are going to happen quite
that way. It's back to the streets,
kids. There will be no place else
to go this November.

 

 

Review 0i The New Right Wing

 

 

by Roy Bertrand

It seems as ifevery time some-
one mentions he is a conserva-
tive, the average person pictures
him standing there wearing a
coonskin cap, carrying a flag
with thirteen stars, and talking
about the “good old days.” Al-
though I admit that this is better
than wearing hair down to your
nose, carrying a flag with a
hammer and sickle, and plotting
tomorrow’s revolutions, it is a
false portrait of the conserve.-
tive.

The conservative thinks of him-
self as a broad-winner, a pro-
gressive, and a man who cherish-
es his rights and freedoms. He
is as opposed to reaction as the
most extreme leftist. He believes
in a nation that can grow tech-
nologically, but he also values
the traditions of hard work and
clean living that were given to
him by his ancestors. He thinks
of a future Americawhere every-
one can earn his money and live
a rewarding life, not of some
vague Utopia in which the state
provides man with everything.
Of course, he looks to the past,
not with revering eyes, but rather

with analytical ones. He doesn't
see the 1920’s as the greatest
time to duplicate. He doesn’t want
to copy any time in the past; he
wants to help build a better fu-
ture. He doesn’t View capitalism
as an outdated system. He sees
it as the only liar system, one
which has proven it can work.

Another picture of the conser-
vative is the Nazi soldier who
delights in slaughtering Jews,
Catholics, Puerto Ricans, Orien-
tals, and Negroes. This, too, is
an incorrect picture. A conser-
vative prefers other criteria by
which to judge men than skin
color or religion. He doesn’t
judge what they do. Bigots, to
conservatives, are narrow-mind-
ed idiots. Hate-peddlers find no
place in the conservative camp.
By the same token, idealistic
love-peddlers find no place also.
They can play around with their
flowers all they want, and ex-
plain the evils of capitalism.
i personally feel that this is
due to a natural energy to work
and or decency.

A third picture of the conser-
vative is the war-monger. He de-
lights in killing people. Of late,

(Continued on Pg. 14)

in Saigon, Bfen, Hoe, Ton Sun
Nhut, Plieku, Da Hung and other
cities there are extremelyper-
manent looking concrete air
fields with complete control tow-
ers and aircraft hangers.1nevery
city of reasomble size and at
every division base camp there
are wooden, metal and concrete
and steel buildings fully elec-
trified and many with air condi-
tioning. At these same areas
there are blacktopped roads built
by the United States and many
are being built daily. Also in

these areas there are compre-.

hensive PXs, Snack bars, serv-
ice clubs and libraries. These
are not tents, ready to be pulled
down as soon as we free South
Viet Nam from Communist ag-
gression, but permanent struc-
tures for the well being, and
entertainment of, yes, "Yankee
imperialists.”

The American public has also
been swamped withtales of"paci-
fication and friendship pro-
grams." True, those exist to a
small extent, but on a much
more complete level of U.S.
atrocities. .

Child Labor — too often havel
seen Vietnamese children as
young as five years of age fill-
ing and carrying sandbags and
building walls, and bunkers with
them. Under the armed super-
vision of American Gl'si Labor
such as this was not talented
for American children and was
condemned long ago. More often
have i seen Vietnamese children
unloading trash and garbage from
American trucks so as to leave
the GI free to protect them from
"Communist domination." Mean-
while Vietnamese adults work
as galley slaves in the kitchens
of our mess halls at every Amer-
ican base camp in Viet Nam.
incidentally, I have often seen
Vietnamese working as trash
pickers and latrine cleaners.
Perhaps this is not too shock-
ing. Perhaps the Vietnamese want
to do this work. But why is it
that the United States imports
Koreans to work at much less
menial jobs in our snack bars
and Px's? These people work
as clerks and waitresses while
the Vietnamese are resigned to
subservience.

Further, and perhaps most
shocking is the fact that outside
every large US base camp, there
are areas of organized prosti-
tution districts which are sup-
ported by the U.S. government.
The women in these areas are
inspected regularly by U.S. gov-
ern nt employees to protect
the 1's against venereal dis-
ease. The women are Viet-
namese.

Another fact which is practical-
ly unknown to the American pub-
lic is that the Americans are de-
stroying the Vietnamese economy
through inflation. The GI who is

able to, (and thereere may more
are near cities than constantly
in the jungle) goes into town
often with his pocketihllof money
which has been convertedtonet-
namese plasters.

He isabletobuygoodsata
fin- higher price than the aver-
age Vietnamese, and thus, the
merchant is able to raise his
price so high tint his country-
men can't possibly afford his
merchandise. This 'is doubled

‘when you realize that the South

Vietnamese forces are paid by
the United States.

Now a "How would you feel
if?" imagine yourself in your
own home town. How would you
feel if every day, or every oth-
er day tauts rumbled down your
street. These tanks are oftenfol-
lowed by 30 or 40 armed infan-
trymen who search your house
looking for weapons or for reb-
els (your brother or cousin is
probably a rebel): Anything lay-
ing around in your house that
strikes these men's fancy is
simply pocketed. Then the men
go on their merry way stomp-
ing through your garden on the
way out. Oh yes, these men are
about 7471/2 feet tall. (they've got
to be to correspond to our height
over the Vietnamese.) That flight,
artillery rounds explode all
around your town and a few mis-
directed ones fall on your neigh-
bor's house or possibly yours,
completely demolishing the home
and killing "Mr. Jenkins" or
maybe the babysitter and your
kid sister. This is Viet Nam.

Lastly, viewing the economy,
in South Viet Nam, the economy
is almost totally agrarian, and
the villages are established on
a socialistic cooperative basis.
At present, this is the mostprac-
tical economic system for South
Viet Nam. Our system of capital-
ism would destroy the average
people here. The sverage Viet-
namese hasn’t capital for a sys-
tem of private enterprise, and
thus, their cooperatives are their
only protection from thepossible
exploitation of them by the very
few wealthy. Yet, the Great White
United States is ammantly op-
posed to any economy other than
capiulism, which, since it is
effective in the United States
f~ therefore the best for all na-

‘Vhat terribly warped logic .

That is how I see Viet Nam.

President Johnson is being
frighteningly Captain Ahabesque
in his obsessed pursuit of the
Great White Whale of Commu-
nism, and has been blinded from
seeing the immorality of the con-
tinuation of the war.
