Anti-Johnson.
To the Editor:

With the passage of more than
adeqmte time to properly test

'and evaluate the Viehlam related

policies and actions of the Pres-
ident, one must conclude tint his
re-eisction would not be in the
best interest oi the Democratic
Party, but of greater impor-
tance, the interest of the coils-
try. The detailed substantiation
of this concluion is beyond the

is not.

Currently the one reasonable,
logical and lawful m open
to concerned Democrats is to
deny Mr. Johnson the Party’s
nomination. To promote this
course oi action calls for actual
and potential sacrifices from
.those closely affiliated with the
Party. But, to some individmls,
the demands for 'party loyalty'
come second to what they be-
lieve is oi significant national
concern.

Having been a supporter of
Mr. Johnson, i find it neces-
sary to cinnge my position.
lie no longer represents the
ideals for which 1 voted in 1964,
and for which the country stood
the four preceding years. There-
fore, in encouraging and prais-
ing the decanting Democrats
and their cause, 1 cast my lot
with theirs.

ROTC Poll

To the Editor:

On January 4 on the dinner
lines, Living Area Affairs Com-
mission administered a poll to
"ascertain whether or not there
is sufficient student desire to
establish a non-compulsory Air
Force ROTC Program at Al-
bany." There are several as-
pects oi this poll tint lques-
tion. The first is whether it is
within the Jurisdiction of LAAC
to poll the students concerning
curriculum rather than that oi
Academic Affairs.

After 1 questioned the person
who administered the poll on
Dutch Quad he inferred that it
was done upon the "request"
oi Dean Thorns. Therefore my
second point questions whether
LAAC is a tool oi Thorns and
what services he expects from
them.

My third point is that women
were excluded from this poll.
i appreciate the fact that wom-
en are not eligible for ROTC,
but i do not appreciate that they
were not given an opinion in this
poll which might contribute to
a significant change in Univer-
sity policy. it is more than a
question of ROTC in place of
physical education; it is one of
allowing the armed forces into
the curriculum of SUNYA. LAAC
should represent the women as
well as the men both in and out
of University residences.

1 am especially disappointed
that LAAC did not seem to put
much thought into this question
which merits much more consid-
eration. in view of these points
1 question the validity of the
poll; 1 would like to see one
presented thoughtfully by those
who are best in the position to
do so — as i see it, Academic
Affairs.

Needs vs. Books

To the Editor:

Recently I acquired a some-
what disiurbing piece of know-
ledge lrom a reliable source.
it seems that one member of
the Bookstore Advisory Board
would like to turn the State Unl-
verslty'Bookstore into a Sclb-
ner's. Drugs, records, cards,
cameras, sweatshirts, and other
assorted non-literary items such
as school supplies are unnec-
essary for the student, says this
misaligned faculty member. The
Bookstore, he says, should be
Just that, selling a greatly in-
creased stock oi paperbacks and
hardbound volumes, including
such things asencyclopedias, and
carrying an almost nonexistent

as notebooks. in short, this
faculty member would like the
Bookstore to cater to the faculty
and not to the students. I

1 must agree that the more
books that are offered for sale,
the more compﬁtely the store
will be serving the University.
However, the Bookstore also is
meant to serve the needs of the
students’ daily life. Cigarettes,
drugs, and other simdrles are
necessities for the student, Who
does not want to walk through
,the cold to Stuyvesant Plaza to
buy a bar oi soap. it would be
advisable to devote the present
facilities solely ‘to the sale of
books only if 'another spot on
campus were available for sale
oi other items, but since the
available space on campus is
all, anyone who wants an en-
cyclopedia will have to‘ use the
library's.

While the bookstore is no
Scribner's, it is no Rexall’s
either. in fact, when it completes
its reorganization andrestocking
of its shelves it will have reached
a good compromise between book-
store and drugstore, a welcome
change from the mess that last
year characterized its operation.
At that time the store offered
everyone nothing. Now it offers
everyone something, and therels
no reason to slight one group
in favor oi another.

‘Dear Sara ASP’

To the Editor:
(Dear Sara Asp:)

As a basically Conservative
American student, I rarely find
necessity to "protest" (ugh) any
branch or function oiourwonder-
ful nation and its people. i have
seen the deviations wrought by
certain small minority elements
over the past few years; the pro-
tests, bestlalitles and ingratl-
tudes of the few (mostly "big
city" sons oi immigrants).

l am a tolerant man, however,
and realize the European and
African influences exerted on
them by their families and old-
country based organizations. 1
know that as they grow acquaint-
ed with our great land they will
come to realize their mistakes
and will accept enthusiastically,
as do we all, the fine way of life
that is America.

However, i finally feel forced
to speak out, now, againstagrave
sedition which has quietly appear-
ed to infect this campus far be-
yond the undercurrent of
ignorance of whichl have written.

Your paper over slncei arrived
at this campus, has certainly re-
flected the fine patriotic, Ameri-
can attitudes expressed by the
S.U,N.Y.A. student body. But
suddenly, over the past few
issues l have detected certain un-
savory, un-American influences
creeping into its pages.

Take, as the main example
so far, your two page "Communi-
cations" column of Oct. 12, 1007.
("Communications"? Funny how
similar that word is in appear-
ance to another term that be-
gins: “Communi . . ." Coinci-
dence? Really? Some Coin-
cldencel)

Just looking at the first three
“articles” we find: "inter-
national paciflam', fthe right of
labotage,’ 'dlsruption of the

Pentagon,’ and 'llmitations of the
freedom of speech for Johnson,
McNamara and others.’ "

Now really, 1 know that a little
liberalism is inescapable evenin
a nation as great as America,
but this is excessive to the point
of insanity. Nuts like these three
writers are a danger to the well
being of us all.

Here are people who refuse
0 even write under their own
names; the obvious pseudonyms
all three employ show their true
yellow Commie mettle. (They
must be pseudonyms. i know of
the people right on campus with
identical names and i am certain
that they are not ranting radical
persons at all. They should all
get together and sue.

To shower such ridiculous
abuse on the head of such a line
one-hundred per cent American
as Michael J. Rose is to defeat
completely any even half legiti-
mate sentiments that Such
radicals might hold.

The first writer feared that
our hard earned Freedom of
Speech was endangered by the
lunatic fringe. 1 cannot help but
agree with him. (1 am, as they
say, a tolerant man). it is Com-
mles like this that strain our
great Democracy towherewe can
only say “Oh Lord forgive them
for what they do, for they are
like unto children," and hope that
some day the fine spirit that is
America shall come to warm
even their cold eastern hearts.

Clean up your paper before
it is to late. Drive the nuts from
your gates. The

People of this great
land must be served.
God help‘ us,
Edward Silver

It’s All Greek to Me...

The Game Is

by Maggie Diet:

Due to the semester-1mg ef-
forts of the co-chairmen and
committee chairmen, plans for
Greek Week are nearing com-
pletion, with the unfortunate ex-
ception of those involving fl-
nances.

Publicity and operational ex-
penses have been met by [EC-
lSC contributions. The difficulty
lies in procuring a subsidy for an
All-University Concert culminat-
ing the week-long gamut of activi-
ties.

The inherent problem lies in
the purpose of the activities them-
selves. Particlpatlon in the
festivities is open to any and all
members of this University;
Greek Week is not limited in
welcome to present fraternity
and sorority members.

Contributions have initially
come from the pockets of in-
dividual Greek members, but
these have been given in the in-
terest of supporting numerous

Library Receives Manuscript

Greek Week

and varied functions Open to the
University.

in view of the situation, i
would suggest a possible solution
in the cooperation of Student
Association with the Greek Week
Committee. Each fraternity and
sorority requests its individual
members to pay student tax;
however, no benefits are derived
for the group. Only the indivi-
duals beneflt personally.

Fraternities and sororities are
not part of our Student Govern-
ment structure; they do not re-
ceive budgets as do commis-
sions and clubs. The Greek
Groups have always remained
financially independent ofStudent
Government, and there seems no
reason for a different method of
operation at this level.

A cmperatlve effort in the
form of a loan or subsidy for a
University-wide activity might
produce the most beneficial and
enjoyable result for all con-
cerned.

Gift of Torrente-Ballester

This past Wednesday, the Uni-
versity's library was the
recipient of the original manu-
script of the latest novel by
Gonzalo Torrente—Baliester, one
of the foremost contemporary
Spanish novelists.

Mr. Torrente-Ballester, a
member of the faculty as a dis-
tinguished professor of Spanish
literature since 1966, has en-
titled the work DON JUAN. Writ-
ten ln 1963, the novel is con-
cerned with a modern approach
to the life of the mysthlcal char-
acter, Don Juan.

The manuscript was present-
ed at a formal reception by Dr.
Charles W. Colman, chairman of
the department of romance langu-
ages, on behalf of Torrents-
Ballestol‘. Receiving the addition
to the University's rapidly ex-
panding Spanish collection was
Miss Alice Hastings, director of
libraries.

Guests at the reception lnclud-
ed chairmen of the modern langu-
3888 departments at many nearby
colleges and universities. Others
in attendance were University
administration and faculty repre-
santatives.

in addition to the manuscript
of his novel, Torrento-Bnllastor
also presented his own personal
noted with observations of life in
Spain.

The newly acquired works of
professor Torrents - Dallesier
will be placed in the rare book
room of the library where they
"WY be seen and consulted by in-
terested students. Priormplnce-
ment in the room, the manuscript
90d notes are scheduled to be on
display in the library.

Torrents-Balleater arrived in

‘VIL.

this nation in 1060 when be ac-
cepted the position ofdlstingulsh-
ed professor in the Spanish de-
partment at the University. He
held degrees from the institute
de Ensenanza Media and from the
University of Santiago, Chile.

Torrente - Ballester has a
reputation as one of the finest
writers in Spain today. He has
published books of criticism, of
which the most known is PAND-
RAMA OF CONTEMPORARY
SPANISH LITERATURE. He also
has written a number of plays
and novels, none of which has
been printed in the United States.

in the short time he has been
here, Torrents - Bullester has
grown deeply attached to the Uni-
versity. Professor Edwin Munro
of the Spanish department stated
that Torrents-Bulloster "has de-
veloped very quickly a great
sense of loyalty to the Univer-
sity." This can be evidenced by
his enthusiasm andwllllngnessto
engnge in lengthy conversations
or "torulios" with interested
students. Dr. Munro commented
that Torrents-liallcster also has
the grant talent of being an ex-
cellent extomporanoous speaker.

Professor ’l‘orronto-Ballester
is scheduled to have a now work
apponring shortly.

On January 3, 1988, the University adopted the
following policies concerning the sale and service
of alcoholic beverages in the Patroon Room, and
Rathskeller of the Campus Center, at the Mohawk
Campus, Camp Dlpplklll, and the Goodman Place
at Dlpplklll. The regulations are based on the re-
commendations of the Committee to Draft Campus
Alcohol Policy, which includes both students and
faculty members.

The specific recommendations which pertain to
the Campus Center and to the off-campus facilities
which are considered adjuncts of the Campus Cen-
ter are made with the understanding that the Dir-
rector of University Food Service and the Director
of the Campus Center will be in close cooperation
regarding hours of operation of specific facilities,
and specific operational procedures for carrying
out the intended principles.

Alcoholic beverage service in the Patroon Room
and Rathskeller will be initiated at the same time.
That is, one facility should not serve alcoholic
beverages before the other.

i
'Pollcles and Procedures for Serving Alcoholic
Beverages in the Patroon Room

Service of alcoholic beverages in the Patroon
Room is motivated by the concept of "gracious
dining." Beverages are served for the purpose of
enhancing the meal. For this reason, the following
regulations exist:

1. Service in the Patroon Room will coincide
with the hours during which food is served, for as
many days during the seven-day week that the
restaurant facility is open.

2. The Patroon Lounge, with the understanding
that it will not be reserved for special functions
when the restaurant is open, may be used as an
auxiliary facility. That is, only in conjunction with
meal serving:

a. for cocktails when waiting for a free table,
or prior to a reservation.
b. for after-dinner drinks.

3. Alcoholic beverages will be served by waiters
and or waitresses only. This pertains tothe routine
operation of the Patroon Room and Patroon Lounge.
Other arrangements may be made when these
facilities are reserved for special functions.

4. The University reserves the right to request
proper proof of age or identification from any
patron. Acceptable age validation would include the
SUNYA l.D. card, driver's license, and selective
service registration certificate.

5. Should an individual who is refused service,
either due to insufficient proof of age or intoxica-
tlon, become actively indignant, immediate referral
to the Director of the Campus Center, or his de-
slgnoe, is mandated. At the discretion of the Dl-
rector of the Campus Center, this individual may
be further referred tothe appropriate judicial body.

Policies and Procedures for Serving Beer in the
Rathskeller

Establishing “open” hours when beer will be
served in the Rathskeller willolfer both the drinker
and the non-drinker a place on campus in which to
soolalize — a place that by its atmosphere, nature
and standards will encourage socially acceptable
behavior. Because the Rathskeller will be both nfood
facility, and. at time, a "dry" area, the aura o.’ 1

typical bar or grill will not be created.

it is also desirable that students have auplace
on campus” to drink so that they will not be forced
to go off-campus, and so that they srein a situation
which is conduciva to the imparting andintegraticn
of certain educational principles with regard to
seclally acceptable behavior. in such an
atmosphere, the rights of the non-drinker are not
easily lost, hence the opportunity to learn about
the rights of both the individual and the group is
presented.

1. Service of beer is to be on a seven-day basis,
as follows:

‘a. Sunday - Friday: 7:00 PM. to one-half hour
before the closing time of the Rathskeller.

b. Saturday: 2:00 PM to one-half hour before
closing.

c. At the one-half hour before closing, service
is to stop, and beer mugs are to be recalled.
2. Beer only will be dispensed from the beverage

service area.

a. l.D. Cards:

a. Each individual must present an l.D. card
to the bartender. Only one mug of beer per
l.D. card will be served. A non-member ofthe
University will be asked to present some means
of identification such as a driver's license.

b. Bartender will retain l.D. card until empty
mug is returned.

c. Each re-orderlng will necessitate the same
procedure. in this way, no one can pass a mug
to a friend (who has not presented an l.D. card)
for re-fllllng of same. This would necessitate
a person, additional to the bartender, to handle

this procedure.

d. Non-members of the University community
must be "guests" of a member. (This means
that Sponsorship by an individual faculty mem-
bar or student of an outsider is necessary. it
would then be exceedingly difficult for “wander-
ers" to avail themselves of the service and
to potentially cause problems resulting from
consumption of beer.)

4. Should an individual who is refused service,
either due to insufficient proof of age or intoxica-
tion, become actively indignant, immediate referral
to the Director of the Campus Center, or his
designee, is mandated. At the discretion of the
Director of the Campus Center, this individual
may be further referred to the appropriate student
judicial body.

Policies and Procedures Concerning Alcohol at
Mohawk Campus, Camp Dlpplklll and Goodman
Place at Dlpplklll

At registered and approved events, and during
designated "men" hours all legally-eligible mem-
bers of the University community, and their
specifically invited guests, are permitted to bring,
serve and consume their own alcoholic beverages
at the Mohawk Campus, Camp Dlpplklll and the
Goodman Place at Dlpplklll. TheStudentActlvlties-
Campus Center Office has responsibility for the
registration and approval of events, and for the
execution of the same guidelines and policies with
regard to functions at which alcohol is served, as
exist for the Campus Center.

1. No one under 18 years of age will be per-
mitted to drink;

2. The present chaperone policy shall be main-
tained;

3. The responsibility for the behavior of the
members of the group rests with the leaders.

4. The individual is expected to assume a high
degree of personal responsibility.

These regulations are promulgated with the
understanding that the responsibility for adminis-
tering the use of the Mohawk Campus, Camp
Dlpplklll and the Goodman Place, is vested in the
appropriate official of the Student Activities-
Campus Center Office staff.
