will help make this a better,

more penetrating section.

There will also be a few ad-

importance that they must not

sity. Pianist Samuel Sanders will
accompany Mr. Perlman.

Praised by Albert Goldberg in
the Los Angeles Times as "a
major talent among the younger
generation,” and by the New York
Times as "a sensational violin-
ist," Mr. Perlman recently made
successful appearances in New
York and Tanglewood.

In 1903, Perlman made his
first'Carnegie Hall appearance,
playing with the Native Orches-

Association. A year later,
he scored a major triumph and
received wide acclaim as a bril-
liant young musician, winningthe
coveted Leventritt Memorial
award in international competi-

on.

Many renowned musicians have
found the award a stepping stone
to fame, including Van Cliburn,
and for Perlman it meant con-
cert appearances with the New
York Philharmonic and other
major U.S. orchestras, as well
as $1,000 in cash.

Since then, he has embarked
on extensive concert tours in
this country, Canada and Europe.

in his Albany concert, Perl-
man will perform Beethoven’s
"ltreutser" Sonata, Debussy's
Sonata in G minor, a sonata by
Veraoini': and threewpieces by
Wierdawlti‘. A notation of $8 for

patrons and $1 our student tar
card for studentswill serve as

admission.

There's a certain tone evi-
dent in the best films of 1987 and

,‘it’s'part of a trend in the total
arts

spectrum: cruelty, perver-
sion, and sadism, all existing
for their own cynical sake. With-
out further discussion, wecom-
mence the list:

“Accidentr” Harold Plnter’s
intellectual brain-teaser proved
a trifle obvious, but boasted flaw-
less direction (by Joseph Losey),
beautiful cinematograpw, and ex-
citing performances by Dirk Bo-
gsrds, Stanley Baker, and Vivien
Merchant. -

"The Battle of Algiers:" al-
most the best foreign movie of
the year and one ofthebest semi-
documentaries ever filmed.
Young Italian director Gilllo Pon-
tecorvo is to be praised for this
heart-reading indictment of the
callousness of humanity's wars.

"closely Watched Trains:"
brilliant Czech film by a new
director, Jiri Menzel, that is ac-
tlully perfect. Humorous, sympa-
thetic study of a young man
emerging into the shadow of ma-
turity with an excellent perform-
ance by Vaclav Neckar.

"Cool Hand Luke:" Don Pear-
ce’s fascinating portrait of an
American idol, the social rebel,
is gently transferred to the
screen by firstnfilm director Stu-
art Rosenberg. Lovely colorpho-
tography is matchdd by Oscar-
caliber performances by Paul
Newman, Jo Van Fleet, and
George Kennedy, with good act-
ing also from J.D. Cannon,
Strother Martin, Lou Antonio,
and Robert Drives.

“The Deadly Affairz” John Le
Carre's cynical account of the
deadly emotional involvement of
an intelligence officer, his wife,
his friends, and a spy ring is
translated to the screen with
precise cinematography and cold,
heartless cruelty by American
Art director Sidney Lumet. stun-
ning performances are garnered
from a cast of top-notch Thes-
pians, including James Mason,
Maidmillian Schell, Simone Sig-
noret, Harry Andrews, and Roy
K ear.

“Divorce American Style:"
surprisingly mature study by
screenwriter Norman Lear and
director Bud Yorkin of Amer-
ican family follies and foibles.
Dick Van Dyke, Debbie Reynolds,
and Jason Robards are worthy
of Oscars, and they’re backed up
by Jean Simmons, Van Johnson,
Joe Plynn,Emmaline Henry, Tom
Bosley, Lee Grant, Martin Gabel,
Shelley Herman and SammyJack-

n.

“Elvira.Madigan:" the most
beautiful- film of ‘the year, and
one of the loveliest ever made.

'. Sweden's BoWidarberg is cred-
' ited with both script and direc-
tion of this bittersweet costume
drama and Pia Degermark as
Elvira and Thommy Berggren
as her husband yield brilliantly
subtle performances.
“The Family Ways" Bill
Naughton's one-dirty-joke com-

Brothers with only a few hints
of serial indiscretion. Good per-
formances are acquired from
Hayley Mills, Hywel Bennett, and
John Mills, while the best sup-
porting 'actress ef theyearis dis-
covered ln Marjorie Rhodes.

"Estherr" Hungary's lstvan
Szabo wisely avoids sentimen-
tality in this warm, human ac-
count of a boy'sidealizedlove for
his long dead father not here,
with a heartbreaking perform-
ance from Miklos Gabor.

"The Flim-Flam Man:"Com-
edy scenarist William Rose and
comedy director lrvln Kershner
kick the establishment in this
funny, originalcomedy.0utstand-
ing acting achievements from
George C. Scott and Michael
Sarrazin, with fine accompani-
ment from Sue Lyons, Albert
Salmi, Harry Morgan, Alice
Ghostly, Jack Albertson, and Slim
Pickens.

“La Guerre Est Finis (The
War is Over):" best foreign film
of the year, by master of motion
picture subtlety, Alain Resnais.
Yves Montand, lngrid Thulin, and
Genevieve Bujold give three of
the finest performances of the
year in this suspenseful, bitter
antiwar drama.

"The Graduate:" strong, stun-
ningly photographed runner-up
for best movie. Calder Willing-
ham and Buck Henry have written
a sensationally uproarious
screenplay and Mike Nichols has
filmed it with the care of a
Broadway farce. Marvelous per-
formance by newcomer Dustin
Hoffman, with great support from
Anne Bancroft, Murray Hamil-
ton, William Daniels, and Eliza-
beth Wilson.

“In Cold Blood:” the best film
of 1967. Chilling, dispassionate
screen version of Truman Ca-
pote's cold, methodical bestsel-
ler. Beautifully photographed by
Richard Brooks, with magnificent
acting from John Porsythe, Scott
Wilson, and Robert Blake; John
McLiam is the best supporting
actor of the year.

"In The Heat of the Night:"
Stirling Silliphant's scenario lit-
erally crackles with excitement
and Norman Jewison’s clever
direction keeps the film moving
at a fast, interest-keeping pace.
Sidney Poitier delivers his best

actiu to date, but Rod Steiger
out-classes him withthe bestper-
formance by an‘ actor for: 1907;
also at the peak of their talents
are Warren Oates, Lee Grant and
Scott Wilson.

"The Jokersr'? one can't re-
sist the pun: first film writer-
director Michel Winnerhascer-
tainly come up with a fast, fumy
anti-shifty traditions comedythat'
is reminiscent of Richard Lee-
ter's film technique without be-
ing borineg imitative. Good per-
formances from a bright, British
cast, among whom are‘MiclIrel
Crawford, Oliver. Reed, Harry
Andrews, James Donald, and
Miclrrel Hordern.

"King of Hearts:" Philli e 'de
Broca's sincere, side-sp tting
commentary upon the insanity of
war. Alan Bates leads a cast
of solid clowns, including Adol-
fo Cell, Jean-Claude Briarly,
Francoise Christophe, and the
very scenic Genevieve Bujold.

"'1he,Persecution and Assas-
sination of Jean-Paul Marat as
Performed by the inmates of the
Asylum of Charenton Under the
Direction' of the Marquis de
Sade:" Peter weiss' complex
intellectual maze of philosophical
ideas is brought to the screen in
regal cinematographic perfec-
tion by England's Peter Brooks.
The acting is by the excellent
British Royal Shakespeare Com-
pany, with Patrick Magee, lan
Richardson, Glenda Jackson, and
Clifford Rose in the lead roles.

"The Tiger Makes 0ut:" Mur-
ray Schisgal's stage success is
transferred to the screen by
Arthur Hiller with all the zany,
comic absurdity retained. Hus-
band-wife team Eli Wallach and
Anne Jackson romp through their
parts with joyous lunacy and are
joined with equally insane fervor
by Ruth White, Bob Dishy, and
Charles Nelson Reilly.

"The War Game:" Peter Wat-
kin's frightening visualization of
the dreadful effects of nuclear
war. A cruel, angry picture that
should be mandatory viewing for
everyone.

“The Whisperersz" Bryan
Forbes’ and, lovely poem on the
quality of despair itself. The
late Eric Portman and Forbes'
wife, Nanette Newman, are splen-
did, but it’s Dame Edith Evan's
vehicle from begirudng to end
as she renders the best per-
formance by an actress for 1967.

The Fantasticks

Films

by Dove Bordwell

 

 

Peter Glenville’s "TheComed-
fans” (Delaware Theatre) and
Joshua Logan's "Camelot" (Mad-
ison Theatre) have so many simi-
lar faults and exemplify so much
commonly rotten in cinema to-
day, that lumping them togeth-
er in the same review is as much
a matter of analysis as conven-
ience — killing two turkeys with
one stone.

Both films are stagy, over-
long, filmically static, heavy-
handed in treatment, and unbear-
ably talky. Both display dialogue
that would make a sophomore
weep; two samples out of many:
"Comediansz" "My dear, my
darling, don't torture yourselfl”
and “Camelot:" "Better to be
rubbed clean than rubbed out."
Such deathless dialogues are nev-
er integrated with the settings,
but no matter, since the settings
,are treated so perfunctorin any-
how. And neither film really fits
the wide screen or attempts to
use color creatively.

stylistically both films share
that common fault of contempo-
rary cinema: excrutiating oVer-
use of the extreme facial close-
up. Now such a close-up is like
a fortissimo in orchestral writ-
ing —— you use it sparingly, sav-
ing it for the moment when it
will be most powerful emotional-
ly and esthetically. Though
"Comedians" is replete withthis
flaw, "Camelot" is the worse
offender because with almost
every song-sequence shotin those
extreme close-ups, Logan has
permitted his actors to indulge
in the most histrionic of expres-
sions and gestures. lie does not
know that the camera demands
its own, quieter style of acting,
completely different from that of
the stage; acting exaggerated in
the theatrical mode looks ludi-
crous when splashed across an
enormous cinema screen. For-
tlssimo for three hours is ex-
hausting and, ultimately, boring.

So far 1 bus said nothingabout
the stories (sic) of these films.
"Comedians" is adapted by Gra-
ham Grcene from his novel, and
oddly, his cinema writing is us
prosaic as his prose writing is
cinematic.

The film, as politically agnos-
tic as Greene's “Quiet Ameri-
can," places in Duvalier's Haiti
an exceedingly uninteresting
bunch of people wallowing around
in the stifling political heat, sup-
posedly revealing Haiti as hell
and their souls as empty, but
really revealing that: a) Liz Tay-
lor is twice as ridiculous as
usual in a thick and inconsis-
tent German accent; b) Peter
Ustinov seems uncomfortable
when all he has to do is look
intellectual and tap the side of
his nose with his finger; and
c) Alec Guinness is getting bet-
ter and better at playing Alex
Guinness.

Burton wears his usual haggard
belligerence and muddles through
his part. It may be nigglingtoob-
ject to the implausibility of a
couple of lunatic American tour-
ists when none of the characters
possesses the solidity of card-
board. The plot finally starts
to move in the last half-hour,
when the film seems to end three
distinct times. Glenville’s direc-
tion is hackncyed throughout, with
the exception of a shot of a toad
by a corpse which is momentar-
ily arresting.

"Camelot" is painfully whim-
sical, selfconsciously pretty,
and rigidly stagebound. ltposscsn
see one of the most tedious ex-
positions on film, a meaningless
prelude to a flashback which does
not even have the courage of its
own banality, since it includes
many events the narrator could
have no knowledge of.

Every snatch of song or die-
loguc comes Special Delivery,
always in closeup. Moreover,
Joshua Logan simply cannot con-
trol a film: the joustiug tour-
nament is a paralyzing bore, the
costumes look like costumes, all
but two shots aren’tevenplcture-
postcard good, the songs are
clumsily dubbed, and the
matched-action cuts -— the most
elementary piece of technique
a director learns — inVnriubly
don't match.

nvu‘ln'nnmvin’ IJH -m

it was with considerable apprehension that i
took my seat at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater in
New York for "How Now, Dow Jones!" My sus-
picious nature was aroused because the last
play that l saw at this theater was the horrible
“Skyscraper,” and to add to.this was the fact
that no big-name leads were listed on the bill.

,‘l‘he only really familiar names were George

Abbott, Oliver Smith, and Philip J. Lang, and
these were only in the technical realm. Never-
theless, I took a deep breath, and the rather bor-
ing but percussive overture brought the cur-
tain up.

Broadway has had a terrible time getting musi-
cals off the ground this season. This is due,l
believe, to the rather harsh critic’s reviews
("llenry, Sweet Henry" has suffered unduly),
and because the music theater is caught in a
vacuum. People are getting weary of burlesque-
type shows, even if they are the only big hits,
and they are searching for something besides
the bombastic "Mame’s" and "Dolly’s," yet they
are hoping for something original, new, and en-
tertaining. So far nothing too original has shown
up except for Dow Jones which probably fits the
bill of originality the best of anything so far this
season or last!

Curtain Rises

As the curtain rises, we find Cynthia, a guide
played by Brenda Vaccaro, leading a typical group
of sightseers (the audience) on an untypical tour
of the "heartbeat" of our mighty nation, the stock
market on Wall Street. These tourists, however,
are about to see a little more than is customary.
Cynthia has a mad crush on the head of the New
York Stock Exchange, Mr.Wingatc,while her friend
Kate (Marlyn Mason), the voice of Dow Jones who
announces the trend of the stock market hourly,
thinks she is in love with a clerk who will not
marry her until the stock market hits 1,000.
Kate meets another guy named Charley (Anthony
Roberts) at a nearby Child’s Restaurant.

Charley has been a failure in life, and is pres-
ently getting drunk so he can go out and commit
suicide. Kate joins him, but they suddenly find
themselves really enjoying each other’s company
-—"Live a Little," and “The Pleasurc’s about to
be Mine." The romantic escapade ends up in bed,
but the following morning Kate decides that she
must leave Charley for good because she has to
preserve her reputable stature, and because Char-
ley is really a failure. She sings "Walk Away,"
an almost good song!

in the meantime, Mr. Wingate and the tycoons
are trying to find someone who will be able to sell
stock to those wealthy widows and orphans. They
need a guy who is shy and easily mothered to at-
tract these women whose only interest in stocks
is whether or not the President of the company is
handsome and wears glasses — a terribly true
comment on an actual state of affairs. Charley is
hired and becomes an amazing success because
of his popularity with the women. They celebrate
his popularity in the show stopper, "Step to the
Rear.”

Kate Pregnant

Kate has gotten pregnant from her little es-
capade, and realizes that she really loves Char-
ley. Cynthia and her doctor tell her that she'll
get over it in “Shakespeare Lied," but in an at-
tempt to resolve her troubles she decides to mar-

ry the clerk by making the announcement tilt
Dow Jones has hit 1000. Then she realizes her
mistake not only because she loves Charley, but
because she has endangered the stability of the
market. Her song about her "Big Trouble" ends
the first act.

The second act opens in the Ascot tradition
of "My Fair Lady" — "Credo" — a rather se-
date chorus number. Everyone siarts buying stock
madly, and it is obvious that the stack market
is headed for "Big Trouble." Charley has toin-
form his widows that they are about to be ruined,
and everybody rushes out in search of Kate who
has disappeared — "Panic", a big dance-chase
number staged very cleverly.

Charley and Kate solve the problem for every-
one, including Cynthia who has become the unused
mistress of Mr. Wingate, by bringing in A.K.,
the world’s richest man who is persuaded to buy
some of every kind of stock to save the market.
Everyone ends up happy — "That’s Good Enough
for Me."

For a while i was really worried because the
show was very slow getting started — even the
actors and chorus had no life. All of a sudden,
Charley and the widows bring the house down with
their song “Step to the Rear," and the show
moves along at a rather brisk pace right to the
end. The score, created by Elmer Bernstein
and Carolyn Leigh, is really not memorable, but
the songs are enjoyable. Bernstein has been the
composer for "Hawaii" and "Thoroughly Modern
Millie," while Carolyn Leigh has done the lyrics
for “Wild Cat” and "Little Me." Max Shulman,
the librettist, has created a script which is full
of cute laughs and commentary on the times. The
problem is that it is so dated that no one will
laugh in a couple of years.

Cost Delighted

The cast, although not made up of big name
stars, is truly a delight. Brenda Vaccaro, play-
ing Cynthia, is really the tops. Her personality
and husky singing voice both radiate in every
way except distinct audibility. Kate, portrayed
by Marlyn Mason, is enjoyable, and Anthony
Powers, as Charley, is truly delightful. Hiram
Sherman, as Wingate, plays his role beautifully
and in good comic style, and all of the widows
are really quite hysterical, particularly Charlotte
Jones whom many will remember for her recent
role as Mother Burnside in "Mama."

Oliver Smith, the famed scenic designer, has
designed what i think is probably his worst set.
It is a bore of scanty drops, and unreal flats
and movesble platforms. The platforms which
may be moved about on the stage are stored be-
hind two ugly flats which are lowered to con-
ceal the tables etc., on the platforms, really
creating a lousy looking stage. The only clever
and good feature is the scrim of New York's
skyline on which all of the buildings look like
ticker tape. The choreography leaves a great
deal to be desired — there's nothing new or
clever to be seen here, and the lighting by Mar-
tin Aronsteln is adequate.

How long Dow Jones will last is anybody's
guess, but I fear that it will not be for very
long. Nevertheless, if you are looking for some
rather good entertainment and a few laughs,
make this show a part of your theatrical itiner-
ary. Tickets are readily available.
