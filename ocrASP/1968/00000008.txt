temporary art were on dieplayin

‘Hamlet’ A uditions

Early In Feb.

The First Quarto version of
“Hamlet,” the final production
of the 1967-88 season by the
State University Theatre, will
have its auditions Monday, Tues-
day, and Wednesday, February
5, 6, and 7, 1968 at 7:30 p.m.

Hall.

This rarely staged edition of
the Shakespeare classic will be
directed by Dr. Jarka M. Burlan
of the Department of Speech and
Dramatic Art of the University.
Burian stressed the fact that
the auditions are open to all
students at the University: the
play has openings for more than
twenty male roles and two major
female ports.

"Hamlet" is the first Shake-
spearean play to be presented by
the State University Theatre
since the 1961 staging of
"Othello." This latest Elizabe-
than tragedy isscheduled for per-
formance Wednesday through
Saturday, May 8-11, 1968.

The First Quarto version oi
"Hamlet" is approximately half
the length oi the standard modern
editions of the play, as well as
being somewhatdifferent in form.
However, the editor of this us-
ually criticized edition feels that
the First Quarto version is thea-
grically superior to the more
familiar edition.

Exactly how the First Quarto
version originated still poses a
problem for Shakespearean scho-
lars. Some critics have suggested
that it was a first draft of the
present version. Other critics
have theorized that this edition
is a “pirate script," which would
account for its differences from
the standard version.

Reverie

by Walt Doherty

 

 

Now showing at the Campus
Center Gallery (that’s the balcony
around the entrance hall) is Mrs.
Lois Gregg’s exhibit of fabric
designs. Mrs. Gregg is an As-
sociate Dean of Students here
at the University, and this is
her first showing in New York
since she has come here.

The works are mostly fabric
collage which means, basically,
that cut-up pieces of cloth have
been placed on top of each other.
This may sound simple, but it’s
difficult to make one and have
it come out looking like some-
thing you’d want hanging in your
living room; fortunately Mrs.
Gregg can do this.

One problem a person might
overlook in making one of these
montages is the texture of the
cloth (or fabric or paper). in a.
mantage of predominately one
color, the texture can play an
important influence. In the one
called "Night shadows", texture
as well as color figures im-
portantly.

Also in the show are some
paintings done with acrylic paints
which are much like oil paints
except that they are water-based
rather than oil-based. There are
also three works done with broken

been attached to a mirror.

These are very colorful; one
called “Bright Sea” seems to be
a three-d mound that flatens it-
self out as you appronch it and
then reforms itself after you’ve
passed. Unfortunately the gallery
presents some problems in rela-
tion to another of the glass-and-
mlrror works; “Cathedral” was
designed to be hung at a height
above a persons head, but here
it's at eye-level.

The most interesting of the
works are the fabric collage.
There are several which show
scenes, one of a small Mexican
fishing village, one of an Arabic
town, and a Mid-Western horizon.
Each of these has it own special
problem either in color, or tea-
ture, or arrangement allofwhlch
Mrs. Gregg solves well. in the
Mid-Western landscape the
mountains in the background are
done with perfectly flat cloth;
however, by the way the cloth is
cut and the way contrasting colors
are arranged around the moun-
tains, the picture takes on a
three-d, or at least a more real,
aspect.

One piece in particular which
l like is “Shocking Pink.” Mrs.
Gregg's use of red is some-
thing alive.

It's a good show. The only
criticism that I have is Why did
we have to wait so long to get
it here.

" More Stately Mansions," now
playing at the Broadhurst Theatre
with ingrid Bergman, Arthur Hill
and Coleen Dewhurst, brill!s E"-
gene O'Neili's tragedy to the
American stage for ' the first
time.

ingrid Bergman’s appearance
as the mother in a thwarted tri-
angle introduces her, after 20
years away from Broadway, to a
new theatre-going generation. it
is it fine opportunity to seeareal
acting pro at work. Not a role to
particularly display her ver-
satility, the part is, rather, an
easy one for Miss Bergman to
play.

The crux of the story is the
warped triangle of a mother, her
son, and the son's wife. Theweak
son (Arthur Hill as Simon) is
made to choose betweenastrong-
willed mother and an equally
strong-willed wife (Coleen Dew-
hurst as Sara). Torn between
these two willful females, Simon
finally eases out of the tangle, to
let the two women battle it out.
Swaying from doting affection to
raging hate for each other, the
wife and mother almost destroy
each other to win out in Simon’s
affection.

Miss Bergman intermittently
flubs her lines and seems, some-
how, quite unconcerned as to
where her son's loyalty does lie.
But she pulls through toastrong,
credible finish by the third act,
arriving at an overall satisfying
performance. She is, without a
doubt, the play's real star.

Arthur Hill as the son Simon
brings a peculiar flaw to his
portrayal. He comes through as
too strong a person for such a
weak role. Had he soft-pedaled
his strength, ,he might be more
convincing. But he didn't, so his
performance lacks believability.

Coleen Dewhurst as the wife,
Sara, seems to think that if you
can scream and bellow your lines,
at intervals,_you can act well.
Not quite. liar Irish accent is
remarkably unpredictable. Thick
at the beginning, it waits off to
almost nothing by the play's end.
Campus In‘Trme’

This week's “Time Magazine"
is carrying an article on the
State University featuring Chan-
cellor Samuel B. Gould and his
clusters of universities and col-
leges.

“Time” classed this Campus
as “Miami Beach North" and
carried a picture, taken during
the summer, of the campus. The
magazine pictured the University
as “striving for problem-solv-
ing competence in the social

sciences."

According to the weekly Gould
feels that most of the univarsity
is “still more concerned about
whether a student has the right
number of courses for adegree

than whether he has really learn-
ed anything or not.”

Some critics have said that Miss
Dewhurst "steals the show" from
Miss Bergman. This is not at all
the case. Even now, Ingrid Berg-
man holds much of the same
mystery and grace that endeared
her to the public in such films
as "Gaslight" and "Anastasia."

Directed by Jose Quintero,
several notable supporting roles
add to the enjoyment of this play.

‘ Of special note is Richard Bowler

as Benjamin Tenard, who glvesa
polished, fine performance.

Whether you are a frequent
theatre-50“ or if you only get
to a few plays a year keep in
mind "More Stately Mansions”
when you’re deciding on the next
play to see.

Eye To Present

Readings Soon

The Golden Eye, continuing in
the tradition established by Alex
Krakower's recent, successful
dramatic-reading production of
"Macbird," will present two one-
act plays as dramatic readings,
the night of Friday, February 23.

The two plays, Edward Albee’s
"The American Dream" and
Archibald MacLeish’s "The Fall
of the City," will be directed by
Robert B. Cutty.

Cutty stated that auditions for
the plays will be held Wednesday
and Thursday nights, Jan. 1 and
Feb. 31. Cutty added the Albee
comedy has five roles to be filled,
two male and three female.

MacLeish's verse drama util-
izes the talents of six actors,
eight male and one female, and
a chorus, whose number and
gender is flexible. Cutty noted
that there may be a need to
double-cast the plays, because of
the chorus in the second play.

State Quadrangle

Presents Movies
The State Quad Program Coun- ’

oil is sponsoring a showing of
“The Unsinkable Molly Brown”
tonight at 8:30 p.m. in the State
Quad Dining Room. Tomorrow
Evening the Council will show
"The Cardinal.”

Franklin Levy, Stephen Bookin,
Laurence Pearson, and David
Ridge are in charge of the com-
mittee, State Quad Productions,
which rents the films for pre-
sentation on the weekends.

The committee has tentatively
scheduled “Love With the Pro-
per Stranger" and "The Um-
brellas of Cherbough” for show-
ings after intercession.

The Production Board is hop-
ing for a sizeable turnout this
weekend despite the fact that
exams are rapidly approaching.
Levy feels that by attending the
movies, the student is given an
opportunity to break up the tedium
of studying, and at the same time
can simply relax for two or three
hours.

 “at Friday. January .12. 196.8,

"cm _ '
sea.

by Duncan Nixon
Ass ooiaie Sports Editor

 

 

Next semester, hopefully, Albany will take another
big step up in its sports program, with the opening
of the new gym. Finally all sports will be centered
in one place. There will be no more bus trips to
Hudson Valley or Cardinal McCloskey, basketball
games will be right on campus at last. Wrestling
matches will also be on the New Campus for the
first time, and thus they too should get improved
attendance.

The opening of the new gym means that all
sports will now be played on the New Campus.
Soccer and cross-country moved to the New Campus
in 1966, and basketball track and tennis will all
be "out here” this spring.

If having all sports located on campus seems
advantageous to the spectator, it seems doubly
so to the varsity athletes, who for the past few
years have endured considerable inconvenience,
just to get needed practice. The basketball team
has' traveled far and wide the last two years,
practicing all over the Capital District, while
the varsity grapplers have had to suffer in the
stuffy confines of the Page wrestling room.

It is hard to say what effect these conditions
have had on the teams. It would seem that those
who stuck it out may very well have been better
off for the effort, for adversity seems to breed
solidarity, and last year’s basketball and wrest-
ling squads were quite solid. However, there is
no telling how many freshmen prospects were quick-
ly. discouraged by the conditions they found con-
fronting them. Surely there were some.

To say that the acquisition of new and better
facilities will result in better teams may not seem
logical, but if a freshman prospect finds that he
is getting regular practice in a spacious gym, or
an airy well lighted wrestling room, he is far more
likely to stay interested. However, the biggest
advantage probably lies in recruiting. If the coach
has to tell a prospective student, who is trying
to decide between Albany and some other school,
that our basketball games are played in a Catholic
high school on the other side of town, or if he has
to show the prospect the Page wrestling room his
chances of getting that student are likely to drop.

Thus the new gym will make it easier on all
concerned. The spectators will finally be treated
to winter sports on campus, the varsity athletes
will have regular and adequate facilities available,
not only during their season, but all year round,
and the coaches will finally be able to recruit
from excellent facilities without having to worry
about where the next practice will be held.

F rosh Hoopsters Fall

Grapplers

Looking at the fresh hoopsters'
achievements over the week, one
might say they didn't do much.
This would certainly be true
concerning the RPl game, in
which the fresh suffered their
worst drubbing of the season,
losing 107-70.

However, after an important
lecture by Coach Mike O'Brien,
the fresh went out to face the
Alumni, and they played their
most hustling and alert game of
the year. Although they lost, the
game went down to the final
minute against a team which the
Freshmen usually lose to an-
nually by over twenty points.
The final score was a very re-
spectable 85-79.

John Jordan led the way for
the fresh as he hit fifteen shots
from the field and added four
free throws. Les Newmark and
Dave Grilli also chipped in 15
and 10 respectively. The Alumni
were led by former small col-
lege All-American Dick Crossett
who tallied 23.

The freshmen's record is now
M which is disappointing but
not discouraging. All but one of
their losses have been by no
more than eight points, and most
of them could have gone either
way.

The freshmen seem to have
the individual talent that Doc
Sauers is looking for, and coach
O'Brien seems to be working on
developing this talent.

The freshmen wrestling team

recorded its first victory Satur-
day as they outpointed the Fair-
lelgh-chkenson frosh by a 27-14
count.

 

Five will be facing the second
Place team. At the time of this
writing that team had not been
determined.

Potter and APA still new a
match to make up, and the re-
sults of that match will deter-
mine The Five’s opponent. l!
Potter Club sweeps APA 7-0
they will be within two mints
of first place, however, any other
outcome will probably make a
championship for the Bad News
Five a forgone conclusion.

This week AMIA leagues 1d:
11 swung back into action after
the Christmas vacation layoff.

in League 113 the Rake rolled
over Alpha Lamda Chi 78 to 53,
while Alpha Pi Alpha and the‘
Barons ran their records to 3-0,
thing for first place. APA de-
feated the Grads 79-30 and the
Barrens snuck by Sigma Tau Beta

While in the other divisio
1A, the men of Edward Eldrgd
Potter Club also ran their re-
cord to 3-0, by beating the Bruins
in a nip and tuck battle, 50-
46. Elsewhere the Nada ,sllpped
bit the Water Buffalos 37-34, and
Kappa Beta beat Upsilon Phi Sig-
ma 65-37.

In their game the links were
once again [ﬁtted by their high
scorer John Gallagher who col-
lected 21 points, with support
from Ron Rice and Ed Sturgus
who had 17 and 16 points re-
spectively. High for ALC was
Dale Smith who collected 20
points, aided by Wayne Fetter
with 18 points.

Alpha Pl Alpha's weubalanced
team was led by DennyElkins who
hit for 29 points in their romp
over the Grads, who were once
again paced by Gary La Fons.-
tain. Here he couected 19 points,
while his teammate Bill Nenn-
stiel got 13.

The Barons after being down
at the half came back towinunder
the leadership of Dick Adams
and Jim Doyle who netted 30
points together. S'l‘B who led
most of the way, but seemed
to run out of gas late in the
game were paced by Jerry Se.-
perstone with 12 points and Don
Beavers with 10.

Potter Club, which seemed like
a one man team early in the
year has settled down and cur-
rently leads its' division. Their
high men for this game were
any McCloat who netted 141101an
and George Webb who netted 9.
While the Bruins pacer was Mike
Cole who hit for 16 points.

KB meanwhile spread the scor-
ing out in their game as they
were led by Dave Goidstein with
20, while Bob Rifenback andsteve
Flood got 14 apiece.

In League 11, meanwhile, ac-
tion was hot and heavy, with the
real shocker being Potter's‘win
over $1.8 103-32, placing five men
in double figures.
