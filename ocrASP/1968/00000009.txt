Chore To Stop Robinson

by, Don Oppedi sano

, led by the nation's fifth-leading small college scorer

in Jim Robinson, will be in town tonight to face the powerful and exciting Albany State
Great Danes, winners of the 1967 Capital City Basketball Tournament and four straight
at the time of this writing. The locals, supporting a 7-3 record, met Southern Connecticut

States: New Haven in their most recent outing on Tuesday.

Robinson, Division III ECAC Sophomore of the Year two seasons ago and an all ECAC

choice last year,

is currently averaging 32 points a contest. The 6’2" senior

from Dunellen, N.J. possesses a deadly outside shot from anywhere on the court and

VI will present a serious problem to the Dick Sauers’ coached quintet. Six other Tiger

lettermen return, among whom is Rick Cetnar of Amsterdam. The contest is slated
for ’8:30 p.m. at the Cardinal McCloskey’ gymnasium with free bus service leaving at

8:00.

{ Friday, [January I2, 1968 I '0' '

stun“; '

Leading the Purple and Gold, who swept through Hamilton, RPI, Siena, and Brooklyn .
College in their four game win skein, will be junior stalwarts Rich Margison and Scott
Price, who were named co-MVP's of the Capital City classic.

Lots of Depth

Backing up this dynamic duo
are sophomore Jack Adams,
whcis finally coming into his
Own. junior guard Bob Wood,
captain Larry Marcus, sixth
man JimCaverly, and senior
Tom Doody.

Adams.although only 5'9"
is averaging 12 points a game,
and really takes charge on the
court. His steady improvement
has been abigfactorintheteam's
success.

Grader in MS.

Roger Gorham won the last
three points for the Albany
squad as he gained a six to
nothing victory over Walkotten.
The heavyweight division was for-
feited and thus, the final score
was Fairleigh-Dickenson 26, Al-
bany 11.

The wrestling team this year
has already been badly hurt by
injuries as Erik Watts, who was
looking to be a standout has been
sidelined by a pinched nerve,
and Roger Saul the heavyweight
entry has been instructed by his
doctor not to wrestle.

During the Christmas vaca-
tion, Warren Crow, last’s year's
most valuable wrestler partici-
pated in the Wilkes Wrestling
Tournament and won the 123-
pound division. in winning the
tournament, Warren defeated
Tom Ambercrombie who was the
Oklahoma AAU champion, Brian
McGann who won lasi's years
West Point Tournament, and Bill
Desario who finished fourth in
last's years NCAA University Di-
vision Championships. As a re-
sult oi his victory, Crow will
receive an invitation to Olympic
Trials and consequently will be
given an opportunity torepresent
the United States on the U.S.
Olympic Team.

Wood, caged 17 against
Hamilton and is currently
averaging 10.7 ppg in addition to
being the team's third leading
rebounder behind Price and
Margison. However, at the
present time, he is recovering
from penmounia and will be un-
able to play against RIT. His
place will be taken by Tom Doody,
who hit for a personal high of
14 against RPI.

Sauers has also been pleased
with the play of Jim Caverly, a
junior transfer from Brooms
Tech. Jim hit the nets for 12
in the second half to insure the
win against Siena besides pulling
down some clutch rebounds.

Working as a Team

Commenting on the team’s
play, Sauers stated that "We
are playing together more each
game, looking for the open man
and working better as a team.
Adams and Wood aretaklng some
pressure off Price and Mnrglson
with their double-figure scoring,
giving us a well-balanced attack,
which means the defense can’t
concentrate on one or two men
and stop our offense."

But when It comes right dow..
to It, it is Margison and Price
who must perform well if the
Dane offense is going to click.
In the first game of the Tourney
against Hamilton, which the
locals won, l05-87, Margison
tallied 25. In the 86-69 victory
over am on the second night,
Price netted 24. in the finale
aginst Siena, which the Sauers-
men came out on top, 69-63,
both tallied l7. Price,whoseems
to "explode" Into the air, set a
tournament record of 57 points,
while Margison's. 56 also beat
the old mark. Rich led all Albany
rebounders with 39, while Scott
was right behind with 37.

Brooklyn College Falls

In the 80-64 victory over
Brooklyn College Saturday night,
Margison popped in 29 and Price
15. In that contest the Danes

The calendar, submitted to

tions, was discussed for a con-
siderable amount of time. Most

lain State Legislators for theiir-
ing of 27 faculty involved in the
Draft Counseling group were the
major topics of discussion at
President Collins' Monday Con-
ference with Students.

The n .r clause regarding nar-
coti  on University grounds
sta. as that “the regulations . . .
shall expressly forbid the illegal
use of narcotics and dangerous
drugs . . ." it also provides that
the University will cooperate
with health and law enforcement
agencies in the matter.

“1 do not see this as any
change from previously stated
University policy,” President
Collins said. He further indi-
cated that each student infraction
would still be considered as an
individual case.

When questioned on the issue
of double jeopardy involved in
the case of a student being pros-
ecuted through the civil and Uni-
versity courts, President Collins
stated that any case concerninga
violation of University regula-
tions would be decided by the Un-
iversity court system. A trial
in the civil courts would not be
considered by the University.

While the University will “co-
operate” with the civil author-
ities, it will not open health re-
cords or psychological counsel-
ing records to civil agents, nor
will it allow the searching of
any rooms without warrants.

University policy further
states that no administrative of-

ment would be held on Thurs-
day, June 5.

Council members and others
discussed the intercession and
suggested various ways of obtain-
ing one. Various suggestions
were: coming back to school ear-
lier, leaving later and cutting
part of Winter and Spring re-
cess in order to obtain a larger
intersesslon.

Each suggestion was met with
a countering reason on why it
was not desirable or feasible.
In the proposed calendar resi-
dence halls would close over
intersesslon.

Council recommended that the
halls remain open due to the fact
that it is even shorter than this
year's and that a lot oi residents
hardly find it worthwhile to go
home for so short a period.

in the proposed calendar Com-
mencement was to be changed
from the traditional Sunday to

ed, on reasoning that parallel
last year's debate on the same
question, that it remain on
Sunday. '

Council felt that a large per-
centage of parents would not be
able to get a day off and that it
would be an inconvenienceto have
the exercise on Thursday.

represent all points of View.

The University does not pro-
vide facilities for the organiza-
tion but any group of faculty and
students may meet on University
groups to discuss any matters
which interest them. The faculty
members, however, have a re-
sponsibility not to abuse the priv-
ileges which University affilia-
tion affords them.

To a letter from one of the
State Legislators concerned in
the hassel which asked Presi-
dent Collins to give the names
of the faculty members on the
committee and the dates on which
they took the oath affirming sup-
port for the State and Federal
Constitutions, he replied that all
professors took the oath and re-
fused to give any further infor-
mation.

Major Policies Passed,
Doors To Be Closed

Living Area Affairs Commis-
sion (LAAC) approved two major
policy statements, one concern-
ing Open Houses and Visitation
and the other the lower lounges,
at its January 31, meeting. Both
policy statements were co-intro-
duced by Vic Looper and Bob
Holmes, Dutch Quad and Colonial
Quad Representatives to LAAC
respectively.

The first proposal allows for
closed doors during open houses,
abolishes the concept of callers
and allows for an open house to
be set up by a majority vote of

the hall government or residents.

The Commissioners felt that
this would be a major step in the
fulfilling of LAAC's and the Uni-
versity's purpose of grantingstu-
dents the fullest degree of re-
sponsibility, as legally possible.

The broad concept of callers
was anyone of the opposite sex
that went into the residence hall.
All callers had to leave the ball
by 11 p.m. Sunday-Thursday by
l p.m. Friday-Saturday. This was
modified by the second proposal
which allows for the lower loung-
es of the men's residence balls
to remain open for 24 hours if
the hall so elects, to University
residents and their guests of
both sexes for the purpose of so-
cial interaction.

The old policy stated that dur-
ing an open house all doors both
external and internal of partici-
pating suites must remain open.
The new policy states that both
sets of doors may remain closed.

The lntroducers of the bill and
LAAC felt that the dorm should
be more than just a place to eat
and sleep but also a place for
social interaction just like one's

home.
