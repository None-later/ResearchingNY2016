Assemblyman Kelleher Attacks
Draft Counseling Group

by Jill Paanilr
Sin/f Reporter

Republican Assemblyman
Clarence D. Laneof Greene Coun-
ty accused 2'1 Albany state Uni-
versity professors associatai.
with the Teachers' Draft Coun-
seling of "acts of treason," call-
ing them "unfit and unsafe to
teach" according to the “Times
Union.” .

His statement was made pub-
lic by Neil W. Kelleher, Troy
Republican Assemblyman. Kelle-
her told the Assembly that Lane
wrote him that the "teachers
are unfit and unsafe to teach
our young people and should be
removed from their positions."

"Academic freedom does not
Include acts of treason and the
behavior of these teachers is
nothing less than treason" quot.
ed Ksllelier.

Controversy was aroused by
Kelleher earlier when he charg-
ed the University with not stop
plug the teachers from instruct-
ing the students in the intricate
ways of avoiding the draft on

the school grounds.
Kelleher and AssemblymanEd-
wyn Meson melaware Repub-

lican) denounced the University
for allowing “subversive activi-
ties" to appear and remain on
campus.

John Moore of the “Schenec-
tady Gazette" mated Kelleher
as saying that his primary pur-
pose was to see that" lie
facilities are not used for cour-
ses of instruction in how to
"legally aboid the draft."

Replying to the statement by

Discussion

The Golden Eye will present
a discussion on "The Conscien-
tious objector Alternative and the
Draft." Tonight at 9:00 p.m.
the discussion will be focused
upon the definition and nature of
nonviolence.

Appearing with Dr. Charles
Edwards oi the University fac.
ulty and the Rev. Frank snow
will be the Rev. Roger L. Al-
brlght, executive minister of
the VermontCouncll ofchurches.
The Rev. Albrlght served as a
parachute infantry sergeant with
the 82nd Airborne Division.

lie has been a consultant, co-
operator or adviser to many
groups, including the Ford Foun-
dation, the Office of Ecommic
Opportunity, NAACP.

At the Rev. Albright'a sugges.
tion, the emotive committee of
the Vermont Council adopted a
statement in regard to conscieru
tlons objectors: “We would de-
clare our full support of the man
whose conscience does not allow
him to participate in mortal
combat."

-........ .........~.-u

Kelleher that the committee's

intent was to “create conscient-
ious objectors of young men who
for reasons other than moral
want to beat the draft," Dr.
John Reilly, chairman of the
Teachers' Draft Counseling Com-
mittee said the he did not feel
the 27 member group was either
"illegal" or "Critically disobe-
dient." He said there was no
intention to teach a student how
to beat the draft.

The Gazette stated that the
Board of Christian Social Con-
cerns of the Troy Conference
charged Kelleher with “subver-
sion of the law” in attacking
the University professors.

Observing that conscientious
objector status is provided by
law as a military service alter-
native, the Board warned all
male attack such actions of the

anger 0 their subversion.”

her said that there has never
been any indication of a need
by the student body, for this coun-
seling.” Kelleher cited, as an
illustration that "the group is
out to create the need,” the fact
that no student has yet appeared
before the committee.

The statement of purpose of
the Draft Counseling group is
that it "recognises that many
of our young men question whetlu
er or not they can, as amatter
of conscience, serve as soldiers
in the Vietnam war, and further,
that, under conditions imposedby
the draft law, the choice of ser-
vice, alternate service or non-
service represents, for many,
a serious choice about life goals,
and for others, a far reaching
personal crisis.

_Rathskellar Opens
‘ ‘.‘Working Well”

I.D‘ Necessary

The Rathskeller in the Cam-
pus Center opened Tuesday, Jan.
80, to serve beer regularly to
the University community. The
opening was a major step in the
operation of the University's
campus alcohol policy.

Neil Brown, director of
the Campus Center was chair-
man of the committee to draft
the campus alcohol policy. Ac-
cording to Brown, the Rathskel-
ler is working out well, and he
anticipates no problems.

The only restriction that might
cause a problem is that the pres-
ent license does not permit 31.
coholic beverages sold in the
room to be removed from the
premises. Eventually the license
will be expanded so that drinks
can be brought outdoors.

Liquor is also available at oth-
er locations ln the University.
The Patroom Room, a restau-
rant on the second floor of the
Campus Center, is opened to stu-
dents Sunday from 2 p. m.-B p.m.
and every other night from 8
p.m.

Liquor is also available at the
Mohawk Campus, Camp Dlpplkill ,
and the Goodman Place at Dlppl-
kill.

The Service of beer lnthe Rath-
skcller is on a seven-day basis.
The hours are Sunday-Friday:
7 p.m. to one half-hour before
the closing of the Rathskeller,
and Saturday: 2 p.m. to one-half
hour before closing. At one
half-hour before closing, service
is to stop and beer mugs are to
be recalled.

The procedure for getting a
beer is to hand an ID. to the cash-
ier who gives a ticket that is to
be presented to the bartender.
Tile LD; is returned when an
empty mug is returned. A non-
member oi the University will
be asked to present some means
of identification such as a driv-
er's license.

Administration Moves

To New Campus

by Done Del Torre

The Administration Building as
the official entrance to the
University, presents an im-
presslve picture to the visitor.
The plush carpetingand furniture
probably make the building un-
surpassed in any other univer-
sity. The centralization of of-
fices makes the building a con-
venlence unavailable to faculty
and students before.

The major part of the moving
of offices from Draper to their
present locations was completed

last week. According to the secre-
taries the moving was quick and
smooth, and in most cases was
accomplished in a single after-
noon.

Among the offices now included
in the building are the Bursar's
office, the Registrar's office,
the Business Administration,and
personnel offices. in fact, nearly
every administrative office ofthe
University is included in the
building. The office for legal
council will be moving to
the Administration building
shortly.

In order to aid visitors, a re-
ceptionist is located in the main
foyer of the building. This will
be the main entrance to the
University, and a welcome sight
to anyone who is unfamiliar with
the campus.

Prospective students will be
receiving the “red carpot"treni-
mcnt as they are shown into a
lounge to await an interview.
The lounge is quite impressive,
with two marble coffee tables,
und :1 number of plush cllulrs.
Old yearbooks are available for
scrutiny.

President Collins' office is
probably the highlight of the
entire building. Carpetedln plush
green, the office does not contain
a desk, but rather is furnished
wl h two round tables. The book-
case lined room is lighted by two
crystal chandeliers. Adjacent to
the office is the president's
private study. Also on the second
floor is the conference room.
The conference table ls long
enough to seat twenty-two people
in large chairs, and had to be
brought in in three parts.

Charles Bowler, director of
alumni affairs, pointed out that
the Alumni Association has "es-
tablished its claim to fame” by
placing an original painting by
Grandma Moses in its office.The

painting, titled "The Hill Road" ‘

and painted on masonite is still
in the original frame. it was
donated to the Alumni Assoica-
tion by Mrs. Moses' daughter-

in-law, who was a graduate of 7

Albany State.

In contrast to the new modern
building is the clock from Draper
Hall which was placed in the office
of the Assistant to the President,
James M,
‘able grandfather clock has be-
longed to the school since 1895
and provides a change from the
modernism that is so apparent.
Lewis, who collects clocks, felt
that this antique should be saved,
and is responsible for its
presence.

The printing office is now lo-
cated in the Administration
Building. It bus threeoffset print-
ers and prints an estimated 2
million pieces :1 year. It is used
prlmurlly by the faculty and ad-
mlnlstrutlon and prints such
things as the Campus Clipboard
and the sports schedules.

The building, which contains
two corridors down the middle
of it, is arranged so that the ma-
jorlty of the offices are suites.
Most uro carpeted, and the rest
is expected to be curpotetl ul :1

Meetings To De'gin sunday'
F or ~ Resident A ssistantships

Three interest meetings will
be held next week for all students
who wish to become Resident As-
sistants during the '88-'69 school
year. To receive a Resident As-
sistantshlp a student must be a
junior, senior, or graduate stu-
dent at the time of employment.

The meetings will be held on
Sunday, February 11 at 7:00pm.
in the Colonial Quad Flag Room;
7:00 p.m. Monday, February 12
in the State Quad Flag Room,and
7:00 p.m. Tuesday, February 13
in the‘ Dutch Quad Flag Room.

Interested students need only
attend one of these three meet-
ings. Applications for Resident
Assistantshlps will be distribut-
ed at these times. Present Resi-
dent Assistants must reapply if
they wish to be considered for
employment next year.

The purpose of the interest
meetings is to inform all inter-
ested students about the duties
and responsibilities of a Resi-
dent Assistant. Also, any ques-
tions 3 student may have about
the assistantshlps will be an-
swcred.

Applicants should he in sound
academic standing. They are ex-
pected to work and associate with
their peers as they will be in
constant contact and communica-
tion with members of their sec-
tions and with the professional
residence hall staff.

Remuneration for being a Resi-
dent Asslstant consists of free
room and board plus a waiver of
tuition. There is a maximum of
16 credit hours per semester
that a Resident Assistant can
carry.

Since a Resident Assistant is
expected to work 20 hours per
week at his job he cannot expect
to carry on anytime consuming
activities. Yet, membership in

groups outside the rgsidence
balls is encouraged.

The degree to which a Resi-
dent Assistant may participate in
outside activities will depend up-
on a personal evaluation. A Resi-
dent Assistant ls expected to de-
vote his primary efforts to his
residence unit.

Although positions will beopen
on all four quadrangles, the ex-
act number of positions needed
has not been decided upon.
