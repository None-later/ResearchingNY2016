her of appropriations. s'atl-
ing Club wanted a budget of
312,600 with money coming from
three sources: Central Council
Emergency Spending Line (351.),
Athletic Advisory Board Surplus
(AA - Board) and Faculty-Student
Association (FDA), to buy sail-

boats, to provide for main-

tenance, to pay the charter fees
for later-Collegiate Sailing etc.

Council appropriated $2,200 to
buy sailboats which will be used
mainly for recreational pur-
poses. Council also approved a
$5,400 appropriation from AA
Board's surplus. Council acted
on this measure because they
must approve all of its expendi-
tures over $1,000 FSA allocated
$6,000 from its funds totheClub.

Sailing Club members stated
tint the boats bought with AA
Board funds will'be ulsdprimar-
fly for intercollegiate sailing.AA
boats can be used for both rec-
reation and competitive sailing.
They plan to have instructions
and demonstrations on sailing to
attract new members to the club.
All students who have paid stu-
dent Tax were welcomed to par-
ticipate.

Council appropriated $320
from the ESL to AMIA for Inter-
collegiate Council extra-mural
athletics. The Torch was al10cat-
ed 3900 to pay for additional or-
penditures due to the rise in
printing and photography costs.

After these appropriations a

about $12,000 in the red. The

this year, in the red.

"  Directors Specialize

Friday, February'R. me

To Serve Students Better

V by Ira Wolhnen

This past week Colonial Quad
introduced the first stage of a
new policy concerning dormitory
directors on the Quad. The gen-
eral idea oi this plan, which has
also been introduced at State
Quad, is to make each dormi-
tory director a specialist in a
specific area of Quad life which
he has expressed an interest in.

The plan will, hopefully, in the
words of Miss Kathleen Fitz-
williams, currently Dorm Direc-
tor of Herkimer and Morris
Halls, "provide a better service
to students by giving them the
benefit of getting the best per-
son's help in the area he is most
qualiﬁed to assist."

The plan, which is in the neo-
phyte stages right now, is intend-
ed to increase Quad unity and
spirit. At Colonial, presently,
one director has been placed
in charge of the business aspect
of dorm life.

Another director has been giv-
en the task of working with Quad
government and programming.
Two directors have been assign-
ed to work with the Resident As-
sistants.

Admittedly. this program will

"place a greater burden upon

'the R.A.'s and will call for an

increase in student responsibil-'
ity." Fitzwilliams stated.

It is expected that when the
program begins working up to
capacity, it will provide for more
efficient planning oi activities
and increase communications be-
tween students. Another expected
result oi the program will be
greater standardiaatlon oi regu-
lations throughout the Quad.

At present, the plans call for
all the dorm directors to move
from their respective dormitory

offices into one central location.
At Colonial, this location is the
main lobby of Livingston Tower.

The plan was initiated just re-
cently aftera greatdoal oithought
and discussion. Fitewilliams said
that it “Will have little effect
on the student this year” but
added that this is just the initial
stage. By starting at Colonial
this term, we will have the op-
portunity to see how it operates
out on a small scale.

The number of Staff members
will not be affected by any
changes.

Maids On Colonial
To Clean Flat Surfaces

In the near future Colonial
Quad will have a new mainten-
ance system instituted. This sys-
tem involves allowing maids to
enter suites and individual
rooms, to clean the floors and
other flat surfaces in those areas.

The residents will be informed
of the time and day prior to the
flatsur-

faces included in the policy are
desk and dresser tops.

However, it is the responsibil-
ity of the student to remove any.
thing that is on these surfaces.
If he does not, the maid will
not touch them — nor will she
clean them.

Miss Catherine Brown of the
residence staff stated ethat one
of the main reasons for this ac-
tion was that the "wear and tear
on the rooms demands a good
deal of maintenance work which
might be averted if this system
works effectively." She reiterat-
ed that this program was strict-
ly experimental.

The privilege to say "no" to
the maids will not be granted
completely to the student. Ac-
cording to Miss Brown, whether
or not the student consents "The
maids will still clean the floors
and the bathrooms.”

This system has never operat-
ed before atthe Unlverslty.Prior
to this time, maids only clean-
ed lounges and bathrooms.

Student Scholarships

Given For First Time

Last spring, the Commission
for Academic Affairs received
$500 from General Electric for
its part in the selection of the
University’s College team.

After a series of meetings
with Donald Whitlock of
the Financial Aids Office, the
Commission established a scho.
larship to be handled entirely
by students, except for confiden-
tial information concerning fln~
ancial need on the part of the
candidates.

The scholarships were award-
ed this year to Fred Childs and
Richard Epstein. Fred is pre—
sently studying in Wurzburg, Ger-
many while Richard continues his
studies here at Albany.

Childs who attended Union Col-
lege prior to his military ser-
vice, has traveled widely. He
has spent much time in Germany
where he met his wife.

The scholarship is awarded on
financial need as demonstrated
to the Financial Aids Office.
Whitlock of Financial Aids has
worked to assist the connnittoe
in obtaining confidential informa-
tion and soliciting funds. Through
his efforts a check from the
National Merit Scholarship Cor—
poration for $200 has been added
to the present funds.

' The other criterion for the
award is exceptional intellectual
achievement. Candidates must
hch an accumulative average of
8.0 or higher.

The University StudcutScho-
larshlp committee is composed
entirely of students withtho Com-
mission for Aducemic Affairs as

handled many aspects ol‘tne schc»
larship and is now planning its
campaigns for next year’s
awards. ,

They have a number of pro-
jects in the planning stages in-
cluding a tag day and a theater
benefit. The theater benefit will
feature "Camelot" at the Madi-
son Theater on Feb. 29.

Oath For

 

Pages

“Teachers

Upheld For N.Y.S. .

WASHINGTON (CPS) — The
Supreme ‘Court has upheld the
constitutionality of the New York
State affirmative loyalty oath for
teachers in public schools and in
tsx~exempt private schools.

The Court's ruling — its first
in favor of such an oath — came
in the form of a brief order af-
firming a Federal District Court
decision in New York. The Dis-
trict Court had upheld the consti-
tutionality of a New York law
requiring all teachers in pub-
lic schools, and in private schools
with tax-exempt status, to swear
to uphold the Federal and state
constitutions.

The action by the Supreme
Court answers for the first time
the question of whether any type
of loyalty oath for teachers is

constitutional. Since 1961, the

Court has declared loyalty oaths
in five states unconstitutional,
The oaths thrown out bytheCourt
generally have required teachers
to sign that they are not members
or supporters of subversive
groups.

The New York oath which was
upheld reads, "i do solemnly
swear (or affirm) that I will sup-
port the constitution of the Unit-
ed States of America and the con-
stitution oi the State of New
York, and that lwill faithfully dis-
charge, according to the best of
my ability, the duties . . . to
which i am now assigned."

The New York oath is identi-
cal to the oaths of office requir-
ed of many state and federal of-
ficials. The oath has previously

 

been upheld for public officials,
but not for teachers.

The Oath was being tested for
its constitutionality by 27 faculty
members at Adelphi College in
Gardenﬁity, N.Y. Adelphi is a
private institution whose real
property is tax exenipt. Although
the New York oath has been in
effect since 1934, Adelphi,
through inadvertence, had failed
to require its faculty members to
take the oath until October, 1966.
