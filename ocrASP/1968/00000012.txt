Senate Votes
Blaine Repeal

by Vic Looper

The State Senate voted 35-
17 Tuesday, Jan. 30 to repeal
the so-called "Blaine Amend-
ment" and substitute instead
the language of the Federal
Constitution. The action came
about after a number of hours of
mainly partisan debate. Earl
Brydges (ll-Niagara Falls), the
majority leader, introduced the
resolution which also gives
citizens the right to sue the
state for what they consider un-
constitutional expenditures of
funds to parochial schools.

The resolution will have to un-
dergo the following steps before
it can take effect: it must be
passed by the Assembly at this
session, then it will have to
be repassed by both houses next
year and, finally, by the vot-
era.

The earliest time that the peo-
ple will have an opportunity to
vote on the measure will be No-
vember, 1969. if one of the above
steps is not completed, the
process would have to start all
over again.

The vote on the measure was
quite partisan; only two Republi-
cans voted against it. One was
Sen. 1). Clinton Dominick 111 (R-
Newburgh), the Chairman of the
Education Committee. All the
Negro senators and most of those
who represent highly populated
Jewish constituencies voted
against the measure.

If the Assembly acts on the
amendment it will be very late
in the session since the Speaker
Anthony Travis (D- Brooklyn)
is in no hurry to take up the de-
bate. He believes that there
should be a "cooling off" period
due to the emotions that were
aroused over the issue at and af-
ter the Constitutional Conven-
tion that was held last year.

 

BOOKSTORE! As a result of poor planning the check—out
counters were over stuffed in the evenings of the ‘peak rush.’

Shienvold Becomes I EC President

Mike Shienvold became pres-
ident of WC last month upon
the resignation of Larry Pix-
ley. Shienvoid, a junior, and
former vice president of the
Council, plans to encourage more
participation by fraternity mem-
bers in WC functions.

Originally, only a steering
committee of APA, lFC was
chartered as an organization in
April, 1967. At that time Pix-
ley became the first president.

in the first few months of
iFC’s existence, four new fra-
ternities have been admitted, al-
most doubling the size. Pan-Hel-
lenic Council has been restruc-
tured and many services to the
school have been rendered. They
include the Ernie Davis Leuke-
mia Fund and aid to Arbor Hill.

Pixley, whose term would have
ended in April, stated that he
resigned because he found that
his numerous duties as pres-
ident left him insufficient time
to be an R.A,, and, as a son-

Narcotics Film

"The Seekers," a film on drug
addiction, will be available to
interested campus groups. The
newly released film produced by
the New York State Narcotics
Addiction Control Center deals
with the drug problem on the
student level.

Throughout the film, groups
of students discuss their past
experiences with drugs from pot
to LSD. The discussants spoke
of the reasons they tried drugs,
the effects they felt and the ex-
periences they had while under
the inﬂuence of drugs.

George Leibowiiz and Judy Os-
doby, student coordinators, have
announced that the film will be
shown in the Assembly Hall of
the Campus Center on February
22 from 1:10 to 4 p.m. and 7
to 9 p.m.; February 23 at 1:10
and February 26 at 1:10 and 4
p.m. The film runs 25 minutes.

Program

paring for college teaching.

A student must have complet-
ed not more than 12 hours of
graduate work by September 1,
1968, to qualify as a beginning
graduate student. .

interested students should ap-
ply directly to the chairman of
the department involved, and
applicants will be notified of
awards on March 15. If the ap-
plicant has not already applied
for admission to doctoral study
through the Office of Graduate
:.de, he should do so imme-
diately.

A national total of 3328 new
fellowships is being funded this
year in approximately 3,000
doctoral programs.

 

 

ior, to go for job interviews.

In addition, he stated that
as his last act as president, he
wished to see lFC recommend
STB for acceptance as a fra-
ternity. Once this was accom-
plished, he felt it best to re-
sign.

President Johnson has asked
Congress for modest increases

during fiscal 1969, but the in-
creases will be offset by severe
reductions in higher education
construction funds.

in his budget message to Con-
gress this week, the President
requested an ncrease of $112
million for existing student fi-
nancial aid programs and a de-
crease of $82 million in the
amount of federal funds for con-
struction grants to colleges.

The administration's budget
also asks $23 million for pro-
posed new legislation in the area
of federal assistance to students.
This request refers to Presi-
dent Johnson’s State of the Un-
ion Message in which he recom-
mended passage .of an Educa-
tional Opportunity Act “to step
up our drive to break down
financial barriers separatingour
young people from college."

Details of this 828 million stu-
dent afd legislation will be in-
cluded in the President's edu-
cation message, which will be
sent to Congress within the next
few weeks.

The administration's 1969bud-
get request also includes“ an
increase of about $86 million
for'educstional research in the
Office of Education, and an in-
crease of nearly $70 million
for teacher training.

The increases in federal aid
to students are spread over a
number of different programs,
resulting in only modest in-
creases for each program.

The President asked to ap-
propriate $193.4 million for na-
tional defame loans, $109.7 mil-
lion for advances for reserve
funds and interest payments,
$145.5 million for work - study
grants; and $15 million under
proposed legislation for pro]-
ect grants to institutions for
services for disadvantaged stu-
dents in college.

In all cases, President's re-
quest falls below the amount nu-
thorized for the programs by
law.

The 1969 program level for
higher education construction
grants under the administra-
ﬁgn's budget totals $225.6 mil-
