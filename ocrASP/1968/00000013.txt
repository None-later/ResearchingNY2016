Legislators On Fire

The Draft Counseling Committee, re-
cently formed by several faculty mem-
bers' and other interested persons, is un-
der fire from certain State Legislators
who are pressuring the administration to
fire the professors involved. We feel that
the action by these Legislators is despic-
able and is aimed, not at improving the
University, but at piling up votes for the
Legislators involved.

It is true that the State University of
New York is run by the State of New York
and subject to some control by the Legis-
lature, but if those running the govern-
ment of the state consider it their pero-
gative to attempt to have University faculty
members fired on such ﬂimsy grounds as

 

The student of this University tradi-
tionally has been given the privilege of re-
taining the privacy of his room. Although
the University reserves the right to enter
the student’s 'room without permission,
Dr. Cliffton C. Thorne, vice president for
student affairs, pointed out at the last
President's Conference with Students, it
is the Administration's policy to enter the
student's room without permission or his
knowledge only in clear cases of emer-
gency.

However, the residence staff is planning
an experiment on Colonial Quad which will
take this privilege of privacy away from
the student. The plan will require a rest-
dent to admit a maid to his room for
cleaning the floors and flat surfaces, such

When one of the editors resigns from
the ASP, he leaves a position which he
has molded to fit his own personality and
ideas. This is very true of the Sports
section and their editor, Glenn Sapir,
with his distinctive editorialcolumn “Jock
Scraps" and particular writing style.

We are very sorry to see Glenn leave
his post, since this means the end of his
many contributions to the ASP as an
editor. Glenn. however, will continue to

these, we feel that they are not equipped
to have any control over a university.Any
university made subject to the vote-get-
ting tricks of such men‘would not be worth
attending.

We are very glad to hear that our ad-
ministration has refused to give the names
of the faculty in the group to these Legis-
lators as has been requested. We hope
that these professors continue their ef-
forts to represent their point of view
among the many represented here. We,
further, hope that these Legislators will
come to their senses and discover what
is meant by an “open campus” and “free-
dom of speech."

as desk tops.

Although it is a justifiable concept that
this procedure may reduce the neglect in
the dorms (which makes necessaryagreat
deal of maintenance work during the sum-
mer), and perhaps, decrease the cost of
rooms, the usurping of a student’s privi-
lege is unjustifiable. The question being
dealt with here is not one of cleanliness
but one of privacy.

To be consistent with the University’s
policy, the residence staff must allow the
student the privilege of requesting a maid
not to clean his room. Since this experi-
ment has not begun, we suggest that the
present plan be changed so that a maid
will enter a student’s room to clean only
if he desires the service.

Nixon (formerly Associate Editor in
Sports).

We thank Glenn for his work on the
ASI3 during his tenure, especially his ex-
pansion of the sports section to three
pages. To Dunc, we extend our congratu-
lations; and we are sure that he too
will make a distinct imprint on the Sports
section.

Cooperation How

. - The addition of two'speci c '

y' narcotics on campus to the student conduct guide-
lines for the State University System leaves no doubt
as to where the University stands with respect to
this growing problem, or does it?

The first clause states that "the regulations . . .
shall expressly forbid the_ illegal use of narcotics
and dangerous drugs on campus” and that each "in.
stitution, through cooperation with the appropriate
health and law enforcement agencies, will provide
no sanctuary for those who violate State and Fed-

what manner will the administration co-
operate? lt is still not clear whether, if a member
of ‘the residence staff discovers someone using nar-
cotics on campus, he will notify the civil authorities
or not. Or will the case be unpublicized and decided
outside the University court system? A clarifica-

tion on this question is seriously needed.
The University System policy further states that

the University shall supervise and authorize “cam-
pus visitations by non-students" and includes a def-
inition of loitering as remaining on University grounds

when “not having any reason or relationship in-
volving custody of or responsibility for a pupil or
student or any other specific, legitimate reason for

being there.”

This can very easily be directed toward removing
possible drug pushers, however, would not a federal
narcotics'agent, if he came onto this campus, come
under this classification also?

Our administration states that it knows of no such

agents on campus;

therefore,

if any are present,

they could have received no such “authorization.”
We doubt, however, that any persons suspected of
being an agent would even be approached and asked

what he was doing here.

This dual standard, we feel, would not be in keep-
ing with the University policy of an "open campus.”
Further, the presence of such agents would seriously
inhibit the free discussion of the issue, since anyone
expressing a pro opinion on the use of narcotics
would be subject to suspicion and possible harass-

mtglrt'. would a federal narcotics agent's "specific,
legitimate reason" be decided by authorities other than
the University administration? We hope that all these
questions will be clarified and-or rectified in the very

near future.

 

The Ri

Regardless of how the US.
resolves the Pueblo crisis, cer-
tain historical lessons can be
drawn from the incident. Our
policy in Vietnam, our disas-
trous restraint in the Korean
War, and the very nature of
Communism itself can be re-
lated to the Pueblo affair.

Many of the critics of the
American commitment in Viet-
nam assert that the Communist
North Vietnamese and the Viet
Cong are each independent of out-
side control, are politicallyinde-
pendent, in other words are be.
nigh, nationalistic Communist
groups. Contrary to this belief,
the seizure of the Pueblo and
other recent incidents has prov-
en that there is unified, planned
Communist activity seeking the
conquest of all South East Asia.
The act of piracy commited by
the North Koreans coincides ex-
actly with a major Communist
military offensive in Vietnam.
This is not coincidence, but an
attempt by the Korean Reds to
help their comrades in Vietnam
by trying to divert the attention
of the U.S. from the Communist
buildup at Khe Sanh.RecentComu
munist attacks on government
troops in Laos, Cambodia, and
Korea further illustrate the co-
hesive Communist force operat-
ing in South East Asia. The ab-
duction of the Pueblo represents
one more part of a carefully
laid lied scheme to harass the
U.S. and remove the *last ob-
stacle to their conquest of South
East Asia.

Today's ominous situation can
be largely attributed to our fail.
ure to dispose of Red China and
her puppets during the Korean
War. Had we allowed MacArthur
to win a real victory in Korea,
we would not be in Viet ‘ m to-

. day, nor would there be a Com-

quest.

munist North Korean government
to hyjack American ships. Tru-
man's refusal to allow MacArthur
to eliminate the Communists in
Asia once and for all must be
regarded as one of the most
costly mistakes in recent Amer-
ican History. As a result, the
legitimate government of China
is Inarooned on Formosa, Red
China has progressed into a nu-
clear power, and the Chinese
Communists are threatening all
South East Asia through manipu-
lation of their allies in Vietnam,
Korea, Laos and Cambodia.
However, more recent events
than the Korean War influenced
the seizure of the Pueblo. Our
soft attitude towards Castro, (:ul-
minating in the Bay of Pigs
fiasco, and our hesitancy to
use our superior military power
to win the war in Vietnam has
encouraged the Red aggressors.
Their boldness has increased
to a point where they dare to de-
tain an American ship! If we
allow them to escape unpunish-
ed for their latest act of ag-
gression, what will theytry next?
If we fail to deal harshly with
the North Korean Communists
we will surely pay the price in
years to come. fled China and
the Soviet Union will continue
to think of us as a paper tiger.
History has shown that an-
peasement has never stopped an
aggressor.l would hope that by
the time this column appears
in the ASP the U.S. will havetak-
on appropriate action against
North Korea. We must show the
Communists that Our attitude to-
wards them is one of strenuous
opposition; that if they persist in
their aggression "OUR might will
make right," that We will use

stud the progressive, liberal
spirit and open-eyed awareness
which pervades the struc-
ture: "i can't think of a single
possibility for education in this
country, that doesn't exist in our
country, that doesn't exist
in our university." Encourag-
ing, isn't he?

We continue the article and
find mention of Alfred Kazin,
English professor of Stony Brook
who finds a "tremendous excite-
ment in its happy, creative
looseness — this is aplace where
the time is right." Kazin may
not inve been following his horo-
scope, but he was reading his tea
leaves correctly. Thursday's
N.Y. Times carried a striking
photograph of a Suffolk County
Police Commissioner.

Paranoid students, perplexed
parents, and pursuing police have
created pandemonium on the
campus.

We are all aware of the drug
scene "right in our own back-
yard." Albany State will be the

-inevitable target of future activi-
ties threatening us with a be-
good-or-bust spirit.

It is impossible to limit stu-
dents here to a pure classifica-
tion of "beads" and "straights."
The grass blight knows no boun-
daries; it affects sorority and
fraternity people as well as in.
habitants of The Cage. it has
taken its toll upon the various
organs of the university, includ-
ing communication and highly
respected councils among grad-
uate students, faculty, fresh-
men and seniors alike. in short;
it's everywhere, it's everywhere!
This is not confined to a small,
clandestine, intimate group,
but is an entity of rather
nmorphlc proportions. it is sur-

 

      
  
   

prising thet the exaggerated fash-
ion of the mass media has not

in halo, "The Giant Everybody
Knows."

It might be worthwhile to ex-
amine this subject in the light
of a cliche which has reached
rather nauseating heights: What's
the big' hassle? The majority of
us are neither ﬂipped out hip-
pies nor threatening addicts bent
upon their fix. It is timetoeccept
the fact tint the beer keg is
rapidly becoming replaced by
the nickle bag. Those who disa-
gree with this stand ought to do
just that; they must not place
impediments in the paths of oth-
ers. The topic has been discus-
sed so thoroughly that it has
become quite overworn. How-
ever, we still allow ourselves
to be scrutinized by the authori-
ties and infiltrated by narcotics
agents; phone tapping is a cer-
tainty. We resolve this with an
anger which fades into silent
aquiescence.

Let us examine Joe College.
He has smoked grass ocassion-
ally, prompted originally by his
curiosity and the desire to clear
up his own misconceptions.Fully
aware of his position in tamper-
ing with the law, he is able to
justify his actions to himself.
He realizes that the drug has had
no ill effect upon him physical-
ly or psychologically — his rank
on Dean’s List will attest to tint.
He finds himself dealing not with
hardened criminals, but rather
fellow students quite similar to
himself. ,

other tinn a slight twinge of
fear, he has successfully evad-
ed the restrictions which might
incrimitnte him.

The treatment of asocialprob-
lem such as this requires an
infinite amount of patience and
a good deal of common sense.
Neither seems to be gaining
much ground at the present time.
There is no logic in the assump.
tion that jailing a student in-

 

  

volved in a drug crime will in
any way eradicate his desire
for it, castignte him, or solve
the problem. As I matter of fact,
present circumstances offer
more of a temptation: the idea
of striking out, breaking the few,
challenging the establishment.

The laws are antiquated, there
is little sense in maintaining
them, and yet we are oblivious
to the necessity of chemo. We
are confronted with an entirely
new set of circumstances and
we botch them, applyingprevious
codes of law because they have
served us well up until now.

The situation is a crucial ,one.
According to the "Times," “op-
eration Stony Brook" involved
198 law-enforcement people who
worked on the raid.

In order to achieve its desired
end it should also have involved
hundreds of students. Arbitrar-
ily choosing a small group of
students to bear the guilt of all
is not only illogical but ineffec~
live.

The State University is bur-
dened with the unique conflict
of owing allegiance to its stu-
dents, the community and tax-
payers at large, and the law.
While the drug problem ins ex-
ceeded the dimensions of the
college campus, it finds ample
breeding grounds in this general
vicinity. Members of the univer-
sity community are provided with
the resources which would enable
them to justify their position to
the lawmakers, in rational, scien-
tific terms. This alternative ap-
pears to be much more appeal-
ing tinn submitting ourselves to
restrictions imposed upon us by
external, uniformed stimuli.

A STORY

Last year Logos Popularii,
the Sociology club, begento make
a little heat for the bookstore
by beginning to investigate such
inner secrets as proper percent.-
age, and wlnt attempts were be-
ing made to serve the students
rather tinn simply to make]
profit. Two prominent members
of Faculty-student Association,
which runs the bookstore, showed
up at a meeting to make an at-
tempt at self-defense.

At this meeting, these men
spent much time explaining the
operation of the bookstore, in-
cluding a discussion of the new
contracts being negotiated with
distributors of cosmetics and
records. it was promised that
very soon prices would be low-
ered on these items, and, in ad-
dition, it was absolutely promis-
ed tint a 10 per cent discount on
all books would be instituted
in August, 1967.

As you all no doubt know,
once again FSA has managed
to pull a fast one over on the
students of this University. It
seems that FSA's only inter-
est in these students is tint they
provide almost the total income
of this organization.

This column, you canbeassur-
ed, will be continuing this story
in the future.

Review Of The N

 

ew Right Wing

 

 

by Roy

There seems to be atime when
principles must be placed aside
for the purpose of practicality.
it is only natural that sane peo-
ple loathe war. But, of course,
wars are sometimes essential,
either immediately or in the
long run, for the defense of a
nation. This is the way i feel
about President Johnson’s re-
strictions on travel abroad.

I regard this subject with mix.
ed emotions. First of all, on the
exterior, I see an infringement
on my liberties. i see a man
preventing me from going where
I desire. And what is the motive
of this man? He intends to re-
strict one of my freedoms for
the purpose of maintaining my
nation's economy. His action is
in the best interest of my na-
tion, hence, in my best inter-
est. But, as i look at it, is there
that much outside of the United
States to see? Should I go to
France, where a senile war hero
considers himself to be to France
what Jesus Christ is to Chris-
tians? Or perhaps to English,
where "saviour" socialism has
forced the nation to devalunte
the pound? On second thought,
scratch England anyway . . . I
don't like hippies. In fact, most
countries around the world
appear not to be such great
places, but ones where an Amer-
ican can most easily empty his
wallet.

So, i conclude by saying that
the only freedom PresidentJohn-
son is restricting is similar to
a law restricting water skiing
in the desert. But . . .

Can a man who seems so con-
cerned with American solvency
be dumb enough to want to pour
money into Britain? Yes. By the

 

Bertrand

way, Britain is one of the coun-
tries whose products can be pur-
chased in North Vietnam and
Cuba. Britain is also the coun-
try which impiored the United
States to become involved with
the blockade of Rhodesia, which
has done nothing to the United
States but ask it not to inter-
fere in its fight for independ-
ence. Can a president really be
so concerned with money, who
is willing to throw away resour-
ces on socialistic programs like
medicare. You’ve heard ofsoclal-
ism. That's what grows from
medical aid for the needy when
a country like Denmark (maybe
the U.S. next) decides that it
costs less to give everyone free
medicine than it does to deter-
mine who is needy. And, I’m
sure you've heard of medicare.
That’s what philanthropists have
decided hypochondriacs need to
give themselves a desire to live.
Meanwhile back at the Cadil-
lacs, the poor people are suf-
fering.

But all this is just a part of
what is called the President's
credibility gap. In the past, Mr.
Johnson has been a bigot who
likes Negroes. Now Mr. Johnson
has become a splendor who likes
to save where he can. All we right-
wingers ask for is a little con-
sistency. We ask that the Presi-
dent either be the man whom we
opposed in 1064 or the man we
would favor in 1968 against a
Rockefeller or a Romney. But
we hope he avoids his weird
brand of the politician on both
sides of the road. However, when
someone is drinking beer while
speeding in an automobile it is
inevitable to be on both sides
of the road.

last year said that: “Few men
are willing to brave the disap-
proval of their fellows, the cen-
sure of their colleagues, the
wrath of their society. Moral
courage is a rarer commodity
than bravery in battle or great
intelligence." 1 believed Kennedy
when he said that, and moreover
I believed that he was ascribing
this moral courage to himself.
Ever since his brother's death
he has spoken to millions of young
people throughout the world and
has imparted the message that we
should stand up and fight the
forces of oppression. He has
brought hope to people from P0-
land to South Africa. Foreigners
see him as an American who
stands apart from his govem-
ment's detested Vietnam policy.
Here was a statesman who could,
and would, oppose Lyndon
Johnson.
And where is Bobby now? He
has run for cover and is lying
low. He is supporting Johnson
for President. One wonders how
our junior senator can reconcile
his new timidity with his brave
words of the past five years.
Mrs. Roosevelt, commenting on
Senator John F. Kennedy’s rec-
ord, said that he could have
shown “less profile and more
courage." The same and more
can be said of Bobby. lie has giv-
en us reason after reason to
oppose the war. lie has spoken
of the "immorality" of our
course. He has saidthattheJohn-
son policy is at variance with what
his brother would have done. He
has led us to the brink of active
dissent and disassociation. But
now he deserts us. He will sup-
port Johnson becauso he wants
to be President in 1972. l sup-
pose that makes sense for him.
We can except no more from
any politician. But we do expect
more from Robert Kennedy. Or
we did.
One must conclude that Bobby
is right. There is very little

moral courage to be found today
in our national leaders. Robert
MacNamara is a case in point.
We all know that he resigned be-
cause of differences between him.
self and the President as re-
gards the conduct of the war.
But he does not tell the people
that. No, he tells us that he
resigned because a $30,000 a
year banker's job is justtoo good
to pass up. And Secretary Gard-
ner of HEW rightfully quit be-
cause the administration has cut
back on Great Society programs.
But he tells us that his health
was the cause for his departure.
And then there were Bill Moyers
and a host of other young men
who just left Washington because
of the wet climate in the Capitol.

All these men showaremarkable
contempt for the public tint they
are supposed to be serving; 1
suppose that they believe that
we will just has our bearing and
become Communists if we learn
that all is not harmony in Wash-
ington.

The next to leave the Adminis-
tration shall be the thereughly
disillusioned Ambassador Ar-
thur Goldberg. I know that this
is too much to even hope, for
but it certainly would be great
if Goldberg garnered together
all ids long dormant "moral
courage" and told us the real
reason for his departure. That
might just introduce a new ele-
ment into our democratic sys-
tem: honesty.
