To the Editor:

I am‘ now available to students
for counsoling on the raft.As
I am affiliated with
Draft Resistance Group it should
be clear that l advocate draft
resistance. On the other hand I
shall be ready to talk withpeqale
who have any sort ofdraft prob-

and to refer students to
‘raft counselors who workwithin
the framework of the Selective
Service System. I maybe reached
in “108 on Wednesdays and
Thursday mornings, although
achiai counseling will notbedcne
there.

'Students shwld know that my
advocacy of draft resistance may
be illegal and that my views do
not represent those of the State
University of New York or of the
Department of Mathematics. At
the same time it is quite legal
for students to consult with me
concerning their draft problems.

“Slap in the Face”

To the Editor:

One of the facilities that a
University this sine should cer-
tainly provide for its community
is an adequate bookstore..'l'his
bookstore should be expected to
carry the texts and supplemen-
tary materials necessary for
course work. The store should,
in addition, be expected to carry
a' variety of other text books and
reading materials not usually
found in the downtown bookstores.
And since the bookstore is run
for the benefit of students and
professors, it is reasonable to
expect that books be sold at some
savings and that there be some
mechanism for purchasing
second-hand books at an even
greater savings.

Why then at the State Univer-
sity of New York at Albany do
we have a combination super-
markebdrugstore that sells over-
ly priced books on the side; that
is obviously run as a profit-mak-
ing institution, not for the benth
of the student and professors
who need it?

The glaring fact of our woe-
fully inadequate bookstore is
made blinding at the beginning of
each semester. In class after
class, students and professors
find the books they intended to
use not available at the book-
store, or that the books had not
been ordered as specified. And,
of course, one is forced to ignore
our bookstore when attemptingto
locate books on the mimeograph-
ed sheets of "supplementary
reading."

It is frustrating to find no books
at the bookstore, to receive no
discount on the books you dobuy,
to be unable to get a used copy.
The frustration is aggrevated
when one does find rows upon
rows of mugs and SUNY jackets.
But what becomes most disturb-
ing of all at the beginning of
each semester is the very atmo-
sphere of our bookstore. '

The fact that the bookstore is
not run for the benefit of the
university community, but in
spite of it, was made very obvi-
ous to many of us last week. It
has always been difficult to tell
ourselves that this is "our"
bookstore when we are frisked
before we enter, observed while
we browse, and checked when
we leave. It is difficult to under-
stand why, after standing in line,
for an hour to see the book list
and standing in line for another
hour to enter the store, you are
rudely told to leave all your per-
sonal belongings in a pile outside
the entrance. And it is not only
difficult but impossible to ration-
alise away the ugly fact of the
armed guard (rent-a-cop, we call
him) that stands at the entrance
of the bookstore and directs you
to the proper line.

Several of us were so dis-
tuebed by this last “slap in the
lace" that we visited Mr. Hayes,
director of the bookstore. last
Wednesday. We were assured that

the officer from the Burns Detec-
tive Agency was there for "our
protection" but that he actually
didn't need a gun. And we were
assured by Mr. Hayes that the
gun would be removed. However.
when we checkedbaﬁ on Thurs-
day and I-‘ridnay, the guard was
still w e gun.

We “are”: the students and
faculty: Is this the kind ofbook-
store youme

In Parting

To the Editor:

I want to explain why my
column, "Notes mom the Move-
ment" will no longer be appear-
ing in the ASP. I agreed to write
a column last fall with the under-
standiiu that what I submitted
would not be altered without my
permission. However, the editors
who recently took over the ASP
do not feel that they can continue
this relationship.

They told me that it is their
responsibility to make certain
that their readers understand that
what I say in my column is
opinion (not to be confused with
facts). Therefore, in my last
column (on the trail of five black
students in Houston, Texas), they
inserted “I feel" three times and
“it seems" once.

The good liberal would be upset
if I said that I was being made
subject to censorship. But it
appears that the editors feel
(after having discussed the
matter with one of our good
deans) that my views are not best
expressed through my particular
style. In our last conversation
the editors let out that they felt
I was using "tricks" to spread
ll rw.nml.n
:pThe editors probably feel that
my refusing to write in the future
is some kind of politicial trick
or that I'm being “irrational.”
That they obvionsly so not see
that their policy hinders my self-
expression is an indication of
what kind of newspaper we will
have for the next year.

P. Pollak

Editor‘s Note: We would
like to correct an error in Mr.
Pollak‘s letter. At no time
did we speak to any one of
our "good deans" about his
column, nor did any approach
as concerning his column. We
agree with Mr. Pollak though
when he states that we do not
see the newspaper's policy
of (avoiding what may be con‘
sidcred to be libel) as not
hindering his sell-expression.

Vietnam Policy

To the Editor:

President Johnson's Vietnam
Policy, if based on the premise of
achieving freedom for the South
Vietnamese or of self-interest of
the United States, is inconsistent
and misleading.

If the goal of American occupa-

tion is a democratic government
for the people of South Vietnam,
then what of the oppressed peo-
ple of Greece, Spain, Hungary,
Haiti, Poland, Argentina, Al-
geria, Congo, Syria, Tibet, etc.
etc.?
If the goal ofAmerican occupa-
tion is to protect our country's
sell-interest, then what of
Castro's Cuba, only 90 miles
from our shores?

It would seem that there is
another explanation for Mr.John-
son's policy. Some would say he
is a "captive" of the military-
induetrial complex and striving
to implement a new imperialism,
or he's misinformed as to the true
political situation in Southeast
Asia. Still others would point to
an arrogant self— ride in his
policy. while eiusione of
granduer are offered as another
explanation.

Regardless of the degree of
truth in the afformentioned, the
fundamental reason for Mr. John~

sai's actions is a lack of under-
standing of nationalism and self-
determination (either explicit or
implicit), and a perverted view
of America's proper role in the
community of nations.

To rectify the situation, Mr.
Johnson should retire or be re-
tired ahd- a successor chosen
who has vision to properly deal
with the problems which exist in
the world and nation today.

Radio Censors

To the Editor:

Whose musical taste does
"our" campus radio station
WSUA serve —- the disc jocides
or the public's? On several pro-
grams the DI will make requests:
“You r est it and we'll play
it;" that is, if the DJ likes the
s you requee .

oSlgturday evening I requested

the popular song "Open Letter to
My Teenage Son” by Vic Lom-
berg. This song had made the
Top Ten on both WTRY and
WPTR. What was the reaction of
"our" campus radio DJ when
this song was requested on his
"All Request Show?" He refused
to play it on the grounds that it
was a "protest song."

To see if this was a constant
attitude, I then requested the
antithesis of "Open Letter" —
namely, "Eve of Destruction," a
protest song if there ever was
one. Did the DJ maintain his
policy by refusing to play this
record ? Nof

Apparently certain DJ's allow
personal taste and bias to enter
into the decision as to which rec.
ords they will play during a "re-
quest show." Evidently it is per-

missible to request songs which
condemn society or America, but
let not a voice be raised in song
to extol the American way of life
or the principles for which this
nation stands!

This station policy of allowing
a DJ to remse to play certain
popular discs with a particular
point of view amounts to nothing
short of Censorship.

“Our” radio station has a re-
sponsibility to the students of
this University to provide us with
the type of music we wish to
hear — regardless of the political
point of view. Or perhaps does
WSUA feel that we are not mature
or intelligent enough toselectthe
songs we wish to hear?

Sincerely yours,
Edward S. Potskowski

Fire Teachers?

To the Editor:

I would like to request that
Assemblyman Niel W. Kelleher,
Clarence D. Lane and Edwyn
Mason who have called for the
firing of the Teachers' Draft
Counselling Committee to con-
sider the following:

I. It is perfectly legal to ad-
vise anyone of his rights con-
cerning the selective act and the
alternatives that are open to him
under this law.

2. My request that they take
the initiative in defining the pro-
gress of this war in terms of
lives restored to usefulness and
the relief of innocent civilian
victims by spending at least as
much time openly supporting
humanitarian projects concerned
with relieving human suffering
and Vietnam as they have spent
in their denounciatlons of some
SUNY faculty members.

This support shouldbe as much
a matter or public record as their
denounciations. If they can not in
conscience agree with me that
we should be doing everything
possible to relieve the innocent
victims of this war whoareliving
in all parts of Vietnam, thenl
ask that they at least give their
wholehearted support to such
efforts in South Vietnam. 1 am
making this request to them in
the name of humanity.

a. My request in the name of
common decency that they de-
nounce the disgusting, immoral,
and insane practice of defining
the prowess of this tragic war
by' counting the dead. Such a

by Don Genneit

In the beginning there were
no fraternities. Miami of the
North was still Albany State
College for Teachers. Suddenly,
tragically, burning his name
into history, State's first flyer,
Edward Eldred Potter, courage-
ously gave_ his life somewhere
in France by crashing his bi-
plane ino the side of a hangar.

Back in the States, Edward's
classmates decided to form a
society in the image and likeness
of the uncelebrated war hero.
Potter Club was born; dedicat-
ed to the ideals of physical ex-
cellence and fair play toward
all. Even today, the members
continue to "do unto others.”

Another group which was form-
ed during this era was original-
ly known as the Spotless Living
Society. Its members fought for
the Student Body by running it
completely. It seemed that all
student officers were filled by
members of the society. Many
years later, a deceptive per-
sonage wormed his way into the
society. A cancer grew up among
the members, a disagreement
concerning the meaning of fra-
ternity. The most Sincere Twen-
ty Brothers broke away from
those who had brought plague into
their society and formed their
own group.

This group gave up its rights
to the name S.L.S. but not their

ability to be elected to student
office. This uncanny knack has
been under scrutiny recently and
has been proven not to be just
the product of winning person-
alities.

Another group, the Albany Pi-
ety Assooiation, was founded
by a group of semi - conserva-
tlves who wished to expose the
evils of drink and the undesir-
ability of women. Striving to-
ward perfection, its members
have abstained from these base
pleasures for many years. To
this very day, no member would
dare drink in public, show emo-
tion in public, or even be seen
in the company of a female.

In 1923, Kevin Baurman, a pi-
lot, enrolled in the Albany Col-
lege for Teachers. He is re-
ported to have worn his flight
jacket daily, a navy blue jacket
with his initials, K.B., emblaz-
ened on the left side.

Others, seeing his jacket and
his amazing success with wom-
en, jumped to the wrong conclu-
sion. Simultaneously, several
students were seen wearing
KB flight jackets. Embarrass-
ed and humiliated at their ac-
tion, these men retained their
jackets and formed a fraternity.

Other groups have been organ-
ized, but none warranting any
attention.

Profiles in. the Performing 11!:

by John Webb

 

,It has been years since I have seen anything
like Broadway this season. There has been flop
after flop, and yet more plans keep coming.
Several weeks ago I thought perhaps that I was
reasonably well acquainted with the state of
Broadway, when all of a sudden a gamit of new
plays and scheduled openings began to be an-
nounced. Now things naturally are really pop-

ping.

"Henry, Sweet Henry," what I considered to
be a reasonable success, not because of Don
Ameche, but because of the stunning perform-
ances of Alice Playten and Robin Wilson, did
not seem to be quite dazzling enough for the
owners of the Palace Theater. When the less-
ing contract came due they sort of upped the
cost so that Henry had to close. It would have
been conceivable for it to move to another
theater because it was selling, but I presume
that with the state of busyness, they were un-
able to find another one. The Palace opened
Tuesday with the "Grand Music Hall of Israel"
which will be there for a limited engagement.

Pearl Bailey, Cab Calloway and the all-Negro
cast of “Hello Dolly” is bringing ticket sales
above those of Carol Channing, and has been
claimed to be a smashing success. Spirit runs
high at the Saint James theater, and a stand-
ing audience has become almost a ritual for
Pearl as she descends the stairs for the title
number. An opening night the spirit was so good
that when the orchestra started its entrance,
a little girl from the audience came dancing
right down the aisle and onto the stage. Pearl
will be there through December, 1988, if her
health holds, and then the show will close.

Angela Lansbury is leaving "Marne" on
March I, an event which is still causing some

speculation in New York. Her

Auntie Mame herself, Rosalind Russell, might
take the part. When approached, she said that
first of all she had made fame in her<original
role, and second of all would not take a second
role. Celeste Holm, who is now on tour was

suggested as a possibility.

"I Do, I Do” has changed forces with Carol
Lawrence and Gordon MacRae, the former

matinee stars of this show,

and Preston’s part. These two originals are
about to start on the road with this show. "Fid-
dler on the Roof" with its new star Harry Goz
is still going strong at the Majestic Threatre,

but I understand that some tickets are avail!

and will close on Feb. 10. Melvin Douglas stars
in a new comedy, "Spofford," at the Ante,
David Burns gives a winning performance in
“The Price" a new play by Arthur Miller at
the Morosco. "Staircase" a comic but highly
understanding play about two aging homosexuals
staring Eli Wallach and Milo O’Shea, plays
at the Blltmore.

"I Never Sang for My Father," opened to
fairly good reviews at the Longacre. It stars
Hal Holbrook and Alan Webb, and is directed
by Alan Schneider, Pmter'SoM stand-by direc-
tor. The new Jule Styne musical opened to med-
iocre reviews. Sidney Poitier makes his debut
as a Broadway director in what he calls a
"fresh and original idea," "Carry Me Back to
MorningSide Heights." A new musical, "Here’s
Where I Belong," is coming to the Billy Rose
Theater this week, and Albert Finney, the star
of the famed play "Luther" is now previewing
in a new comedy, "Joe Egg," at the Brooks

Mike Nichols is back on the scene with a
great line of people. He is directing Neil Si-
mon's comedy, "Plaza Suite" starring George
Scott and the highly talented Maureen Stapleton
with sets by Oliver Smith and lighting by Jean

Rosenthal. This predicted success opens at the

Plymouth on Feb. I4.

“The Happy Time," the Robert Goulet musi-
cal directed and staged by Gower Champion,
runs at the Broadway Theater, but is far from
a smash hit. Succeeding "Mansions. . ." at the
Broadhurst on March 13 will be a new comedy,
"Weekend," by Gore Vidal. Steve Lawrence and
Eder Gorme have opened in a musical "Golden
Rainbow" at the Shubert.

With this unusual mass of shows, I am afraid

taking Martin's

that many good ones will be forced to close
because of a lack of audience. Tickets to some-
thing are readily available but the big hits con-
tinue to be sold out. Huge amounts of money
are being lost, but the New York stage this sea-
son is certainly earning its name as the theater
capital of the world.

all Student Organizations.

The University Count-ll for.

acted, fraternities and sorori-
ties requested that their evalua-
tions be conducted and ronsider-
ed separately from those of Stu-
dent Government and Activities
i'lubs; this request has been com.
piled with.

A format for this year‘s self-
evalnation will soon be distribut.
ed to each fraternity and soror-
ity. It was drawn up by the Com.
mittee on Student Government and
Organizations and representa-
tives from Pan-lloll, IFC, and

pletod evaluations will be done
by sub-committees of the same
group.

The nature of these evalua-

group‘s accomplishments relate
to the goals stated in its Charter
