I implore you to see Jiri Men-
zel's "Closely Watched Trains"
at the earliest possibility. It is
the most feeling film I have seen
in a long time. Unlike most pic-
tures today, it is concerned with
realistic people and their prob-
lems.

"Closely Watched Trains" is
about Mllos, a boy who becomes
a trainmaster in a Czech village
during World War II. Naive, fra-
gile, with a face reminiscent of
the boy's in Olmi's “Ii Pesto,”
he is introduced in a comic open-
ing that explains how his uncle
and grandfather were killed in
the war. Now he has becomes
trainwatcher “to shirk work all
my life and to leave all drudg-
ery to other people." The sta-
tion is populated by an old man,
an alluring female telegraph-
er, a crafty Casanova trainmas-
ter, and a henpecked stationmas.
ter who admonishes the boy: "You
can have your fun, but duty must
always come first."

And for Miles it does. The
fine trainman's cap that is plac.
ed so reverently on his head at
the story's beginning remains
there as a reminder of the de-
mands of duty. But the train-
master’s wholesale seduction of
women and the lechery of apride
of soldiers remind him of his
inexperience with girls.Depress.
cri after he has awkwardly spurn-
ed a cute girl train conductor,
he slashes his wrists; and sud-
denly the comedy sticks in our
throats. From the hospital he re-
turns to the station in disgrace.
lint the sympathetic trainmas-
ter arranges a rendezvous, and
pulling the cap off Milos' head,
pushes him into a room alone
with a woman for a night.

With the film’s characteristic.
nlly abrupt shift of mood, there
comes a twist. The trainman is
in the Czech Underground, and
draws Milos into his plan to slip
a bomb aboard one of the close-
ly-guarded trains that are vital
in the Fuhrer’s cause. The tar-
gct train is due when an official
r' the train company arrives to
tuc'estigate the trainman's ama-
o my activities. Miles sneaks out
and drops the bomb aboard the
pulsing train; he is shot by a
zz-«lrd and dies. The train ex-
plodes; Milos' cap blows away;
:rnncussions shake the station;
tlm- officials rage; (clock chimes
.iug); the end.

This final sequence capsul-
izcs the film's mixture of com-
edy and pathos. The juxtaposi-
tion is not as jarrineg zany
as in, say, "Shoot the Piano
Mayan" the comedy is quiet-
.,~r, the pathos is underplayed
w more like Chekhov or Ren-

lr than Truffaunt.

My summary has not done jus-
we to the exhilarating richness

Coffee House Comes
To Campus Snack Bar

The University has joined the
Coffee House Circuit and the
first performer will be Jake
Holmes and his folk-rock group.
Holmes will appear February
12-17 in the CampusCenter Rath-
skeller Monday-Thursday at 7:30
p.m. and 9:30 p.m.; Friday at
1, 8, 11:00 p.m.; Saturday at
7:30, 9:30 and 11:30 pm.
ones will be approximately one
hour in length and there will
be no admission charge.

The Coffee House Circuit,
which will enable the school to
have eight groups a year, each
performing for one week, has
been organized here by the Cam-
pus Center Governing Board. The
Senior Class is sponsoring the
first group.

Several professional and high-
ly talented singers, comedians,
and entertainers are available
for one week stands through the
Coffee House Circuit. The en-
tertainers travel much in the
order of a road company. They
live in the dorms, eat in the
cafeterias, and interact with the
students on campus.

Schnitzer Photos
In Charming Hall

, An exhibit of photographs by
Klaus Schnitzer is now hung in
Channing Hall of the First Uni-
tarian Church. Approximately
100 photographs are displayed
giving the photographer the op-
portunity to show a wide range
of subjects. The hall is open
from 0:30 p.m. to l p.m. Sun-
day thru Friday and is closed
on Saturday.

Schnitzer began working with
photography at the University
in 1064 with no prior instruction
or knowledge in the field.Hejoin-
ed the student photo service and
served as photo editor of the Al-
bany Student Press and for the
Torch, the University yearbook.

He is currently an assistant
in photography to Mr. Joseph
Alper at the State University at
Albany Art Department and is
studying part-time at the Grad.
uate School of Public Affairs.

Mr. Schnitzer feels that he
is still in a period of learning
and experimentation in photog-
raphy and has not devoloped a
definite philosophy. He tends to
lean towards photo-journalism,
working primarily with small-
frame cameras.

The current exhibit demon-
strates the photographers abil-
ity to work well with light, the
essence of photography, using
its subtleties, its softness, and
its harshness to achieve varied
effects. llis pictures show that
he has a strong perception of
the world about him and an ar-
tist's eye for 

Holmes has played Mr. Kelly's
in Chicago, The Playboy Club in
Miami, and The Bitter End in
New York City.

The Chicago Daily News re-
ports that "as both songwrit-
er and singer, Jake Holmes treats
such subjects as his wandering
eye, human insincerlty, and even
war movies of the 405 with sensi-
tivity and impact."

. 3' "9Primer” Is

Enjoyable Again

"Primer" is now in its 25th
year of publication and its fic-
tion and poetry all reflect the
modernity of the magazine.

The poem by William Schaef-
fer perhaps best reflects the
disillusionment with Society. The
poem is short and terse, and
Schaeffer concludes it with a
three word line which would lose
all its impact if it were any
longer.

in the "Campus Ode" by Jean
Thompson, the author skillfully
compares the modern buildings
to those of Athens, reflecting
not only its beauty but also the
"foreshadow of unbeing." How-
ever, the author switches in mid-
stream from the beauty of the
building's forms to the beauty of
the female students' forms and
the final image is incongruous
to the images in the beginning of
the poem. ‘

"Sheepskin" by Babs Brindisi
beautifully depicts the pursuing
of a goal. The first stanza con-
tains mostly short words, giving
the reader the stop and go ef-
fect of running.

“A Rainy Evening's Walk" by
J. Gillman contains an extreme-
ly skillful use of dark and light
themes. The poem begins with;
the dark image ("dark pavement
at night") switches to oneoflight
and finally returns "towardsthat
great dark infinity that it was
surely born of.”

Robert B. Cutty's poem, "Med.
itations On The Gentle Motion Of
The Passing Rainstorm," begins
with the simple question "what

do you think of the weather we're
having?" and ends with sleeping
pills, cigarette smoke and pot.
The poem is definitely well
thought out but it does not take
the reader long to realize that
the "weather" is just another
word for the present state of af-
fairs. However, the constant use
of “says I" and "says you" is
so distracting that the reader is
only capable of “asthmatic whis-
pers" at the end of this rather
long poem.

Mary Ellen Barrett's best work
is the poem "Mon Ami." All
her works tends to be similar
and after reading one poem or
short story by her, one can
easily recognize her style. The
poem is an excellent character
study, showing a deep perception
of character. The words were not
just put down on paper, but were
thought out. Such a phrase as
"gentle tender smile" proves
that the author sweated to achieve
each word and the final effect
is excellent.

The last poem, "Totality" by
Carol Isaac, takes a rather pro.-
saic idea and phrases it ex-
tremely well. "If within the fit-
ness of man’s stay on earth
he cannot bring joy to someone
other than himself, he should
crawl back into the cave from
whence he came." This is most
appropriate to end "Primer,"
because it is bound to bring
some joy to all its readers and
the big 25th anniversary issue
will be eagerly awaited.

New Exhibitions

Open In Campus 

Center Gallery

A new exhibition entitled “Big
Prints" will open at the Art
Gallery of the State University
at Albany on Thursday evening,
February 15. It will run through
Sunday, March 24.

The show is a national invi-
tational, compiled by Donald Mo-
chon. Director of the Gallery;
Thom O'Connor, an Associate
Professor in the University Art
Department; and Mrs. Charles
Liddle, Associate Director ofthe
Gallery. It will consist of 34
prints by 47 artists.

The idea of having a show of

“giant” prints—some as large
as three and a half by eight
feet—is a. novel one and most
of the artists invited to submit
works were enthusiastic about
the opportunity to show outsize
work.
‘ One of the aims oftneGal-
-lery is to expose the University
students to good print-making;
they will be fortunate to find a
large number of important prints
and printmakers involved in the
show.

Such artists as Leonard
Baskin, Robert Rauschenberg,
Antonio Fresconi, Frank Lobdell,
Garo Antreasian, Sister Mary
Corita, Gabor Peterdi, and Carol
Summers are among those includ-
ed, as well as two of the Uni-
versity's own instructors, Jack
Bosson and Thom O’Connor.

A wide variety of artistic
styles are represented, ranging
from hard-edge and realism to
expressionism, abstraction, and
surrealism. A good many prints
in the exhibition reflect the in-
creasing tendency of print-
makers to experiment with tradi-
tional media and to invent new
media.

A comprehensive catalogue of
the exhibit will be published and
widely distributed. Purchase
prizes worth $1000 will be award-
ed. Prints receiving prizes will
then become a. part of the Art's
Department permanent collec-
tion.

The selection of prizes will
be made by Miss Una Johnson,
Curator of Prints and Drawings
at the Brooklyn Museum. Most
of the prints in the exhibition
are for sale, with prices rang-
ing from $35 to $1000.

An exhibition of photographs
by Larence N. Shustak is now
showing in the Lounge of the
Art Gallery at the State Univer-
sity at Albany.

Shustsk, a free-lance photo-
grapher from Staten Island, New
York, has done photographic work
for record album covers, book
jackets, industry, and advertis-
ing. He has also made some
films. He now teaches photo-
graphy at the School of Visual
Arts in New York City.

This exhibit contains examples
of Shustak's jazz photography, a
series of grsfiti done in and
around New York City, and a
kroup of photographs he calls
Death images, which he shot in
New York and Mexico.

The show will run
February.

Reverie

by Walt Doherty

 

 

The Hollyridge Strings have
a new album out: Beatles Song-
book No. 4; and true to form,
it's good.

A few years ago the Holly-
ridge Strings came out with the
first Beatles songbook in which
the tunes the Beatles made
famous were transcribed for an
orchestra. For the most part
the songs are played exactly as
written except for the fact that
violins and trumpets are curry-
lng the various parts. “I Saw
Her Standing There," “Love Me
Do" were among the best in-
strumentals on that album.

Since their first album the
Strings have gone on to record
several others, and No. 4 is
probably the best or these. In
general, there is the Hollyridge
String "sound" which makes one
of their recordings recognizable,
even if you hear it on the radio,
but you didn’t hear the artists’
name. This “sound,” which is
about as instrumental (typical
background music at a restaur-
ant) as possible, is evident in
only a few of the tunes. F01“
tunately it’s limited to "Eight
Days a Week," “I've Just Seen
a Face," and “You've Got
to Hide Your Love Away."
They're still good,butnotas good
as the rest of the record.

The best band on the disc is
"Penny Lane” which you might
remember from the “Intro”
music of SIDESHOW. This is a
really good arrangement of
"Penny Lane;" it captures the
spirit and originality of the Bea.-
tles' version, yet adds an ori-
ginality and vitality of its own.
This is a quality job.

"Yellow Submarine" is done
with freshness. Basically this is
a monotonous tune, and sing-
songy; however, here it is done
as if it were something new and
catchy; and with the piccolo ar-
rangement, it retains the "salty"
tlavor of the Beetle original.

"Strawberry Fields Forever"
I don’t know about. It's got the

spirit and thought of the first

version, but—maybe it's the
mood, it's sort of thoughty, if
a song can be thought of as being
thoughty.

on the whole, the ‘ L ‘ I
aspects of this album are good,
if not excellent. The recording
is beautifully done because each
song manages to come across.
This, of course, is also due to
the arrangements and orchestra.-
tion. The arrangements some-
times could be improved, but
the orchestration is near perfect
and the playing is faultless.

If you go in for instrumentals,
this album is for you. Of course,
if you’re a classic rock-and-roll
fan (e.g. the Four Tops), stay
away, you won’t like it. Here is
a. calmer style, a more relaxed
one. These are well arranged
tunes, which make good listen-
ing.

l have been able to write this
column. With so much happen-
ing in pop music, I’m going to
summarize much for which I
had entire columns planned.

I went to Los Angelos over
the holidays and caught the cham-
bers Brothers at a cool little
coffee house called the Ash
Grove. These guys are truly dyna-
mic and professional performers
with a great sound combining
soul and blues with a bit of
put-on West Coast freak music.

They've got two singles, "Up-
town,” which never went any-
where, and “Time Has Come
Today,” their new release. Both
are from their new Columbia
album. Although I have to say
that the record is a disappoint-
ment after seeing them live, I’ll
admit it still projects the excite-
ment of their sound —- hard-driv-
ing soul and blues with definite
West Coast influences for that
just a little different effect.

Albums are coming out atsuch
a rate that it is almost impossi-
ble, as well as uneconomical, to
keep up with them, but I will

 

try to hit at least a few.

Probably my greatest joy of
the mass is the Cream's new-
est, "Disreli Gears." When I
reviewed “Fresh Cream."I
thought that such excellent musi-
cians should be able to come
forth with better quality mater-
ial. Now they have proven me
correct. Thanks goes to their
producer Felix Puppalaldi who
has managed to tie their very
often individualistic (like they
don't play together) sound into a
tightly organized unit withoutlos-
ing their individual influence on
each piece.

Worth special note on this very
excellent recording are "Sun-
shine Of Your Love,” which could
be their first single hit in the
United States, and "Tales Of
Brave Ulysses," one of Eric
Clapton’s first attempts into
songwriting.

“Mass In F Minor” by the
“Electric Prunes" certainly
must be commended. Actually,
all the honors should go to the
composer, David Axelrod, for
this ingenious idea of a rock
mass. The holes of the
"Prunes" as the recording

group, however, proved to be a
mistake. Although their perform-
ance is competent, it can hardly
be termed inspirational. Look to
the name Axelrod, because he ap-
pears to have an enlightened fu.
ture both as a writer and ar-
ranger.

Finally, Richie Havens "Some-
thin' Else Again" (Verve) is just
that. Havens is both an accom-
plished instrumentalist writer
and singer. Much of his work is
in the jazz vein and frankly
he could be one of the best
jazz vocalists around.

Also worth mentioning is
Jeremy Steig’s excellent flute
barking on a number of the bands.
Havens comes out as number one,
though, with the new uses he
makes of the sitar in the title
song, "Somethin' Else Again,"
his guitar playing throughout,
and his great vocals.

mlmes (little comedies or ges-
ture and expression played out
in front of passing trains), irony
(two old men discuss the Nazis’
unmitigated cruelty in shipping
. . . sheep and cattle), delicate-
ly finished minor characateriza-
tions (a lecherous old photograph-
er, a wife-murderer, an indig-
nant mother), and fine use of
what Pudovkin called "plastic
material" (the way the repeated
slaughter of rabbits, geese and
pigeons symbolizes the effects
of the war). The cast is excellent
throughout; lregretonly the boy's
tendency to moon around a little
too much. The camerawork is
unobtrusive, the textures con-
vincingly grimy. Nentel uses si-
lence to great advantage: the re.
bounding glances of the charac-
ters carry much of the story.
And I must not omit the seduc-
tion scenes, especially the chain
which the telegrapher's bottom
is rubber-stamped; they are un-
forgettable.

Anyone who cares about cine.
ma will see the film as a matter
of course. But it should as well
be seen by anyone who cares
about people, for seldom does a
picture show us humanity with
the delicate perceptivity and
beauty of "Closely Watched
Trains."
