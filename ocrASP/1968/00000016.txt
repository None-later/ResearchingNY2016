Once again this year the Greek
Week activities which kick-off the
spring 'rush, will include aGreek
Olympic Day, which will be held
from 11.1 a.m. Saturday, Febru-
ary 17 on Alumni Quad. The pur-
pose of Greek Olympic Day is to
introduce the Greeks to the fresh-
men, by presenting them in
competition with each other.

This year the various Greek
groups will ._ be demonstrating
their athletic prowess in the
following events; a snowshoe
race, a snowball throw, a vol-
leyball tournament, and a tug of
war contest.

Soroities First

Sororities and fraternities will
both participate in all events.
The sororities will start off at
11 a.m. and the fraternities will
take over as soon as the girls
finish.

The highlight oi Greek Olym-
pic Day will not be held on Sat-
urday, however. The finals of

the men's tug of war will be
postponed until lulf-time of the
Albany-Siena basketball game
which will be Monday the 18th.

Trophies will be awarded to'

the groups which score the most
team points. First .and second
place trophies will be awarded,

-and a special trophy will be

given to the winners of the men's
tug of war.

' Locations Switched

Last year the events were
well attended by the Greeks, but
very few freshmen got to see the
activities since they were held on
the New campus. This year it is
hoped that the Greek's efforts in
Greek Olympic Day will not go
unnoticed by the freshmen.

Winners last year were Alpha
Pi Alpha and Sigma Alpha, the
events last year included aChar-
lot race which is not included this
year, but the volley ball tourna-
ment is a new addition to replace
that race.

WAA Remains Very Active
Many Sports Are On Tap

by iris Alson

WAA has many activities
scheduled for this spring
semester. There are several
activities already going on and
more which will begin with the
opening of the new gym.

One of the activities which
was started Wed. night Feb. '7
due to strong interest shown
first semester is judo. Lessons
are being given for Albany State
women every Wed. from 4:30-6.
The lessons are being given by a
black belt member of the Troy
Judo Club. The cost for the
lessons is $20 for 3 months.

Another activity which also
started Wed. night was intra-

mural bowling. Handlcaps,teams
and leagues were being estab-
lished on Feb. 7. Intramural bowl-
ing will be on Wed. evenings
from 7:15-9. There will also be
Sat. leagues if enough interest
is shown.

Intramural basketball will be

Thurs. nights from 7-8:30.
Rosters are due Feb. 14. Prac-
tices have also been going on for

will be printed in future ASPs.

Pool Is Really Finished

The sports picture at Albany
State University is enlarging
along with the school itself. This
winter, for the first time, swim-
ming is being introduced on a club
level, joining track and field
which was inaugurated last
spring. The birth of a sport on
campus is difficult, long, often
discouraging, but‘eventually re-
warding. Brian Kelly, who joined
the Albany Staff this fall, is ex-
periencing the trials and tribula-
tions accompanying a newly in-
stituted program, but is optimis-
tic about the future.

The club swimming program is
really more of a recreation op-
portunity than a serious com-
petitive sport at this stage. Any
University student, from fresh-
man to graduate, mav attend
workouts and althougl. Kelly is
keeping records of those who
show the most interest, the prac-
tice sessions are neither‘manda-

tory nor strictly supervised“

Still, it is a start and the coach

is getting some idea of what kind
of talent is at his disposal.

“only a handful of men have
been attending regularly and of
those, there are only a few with
any 'previous competitive exper-
ience,” notes Kelly. "Of course,
Albany never has had a swimming
program, so naturally any high
school swimmer looking at col-
leges would pass us by. Now, we
should attract many students with
ability who would have gone else-
where previously. It takes time
to establish an activity, because
first you must enroll people who
have the talent to offer."

The most promising men at

present, all free stylers, are:
Jon Getbehead, a freshman from
Rome; Allan Seitel, ajunior from
Englewood, N. J.; Matthew
Metzler, a junior from East
Nassau.

in order to participate on a
varsity level, a swimming team
must have at least 15-20 members
available which the club must
follow before it achieves varsity
status. How fast the program ad-
Vances depends entirely on the
interest shown by the prospective
participants. A minimum of two
years on the club level would be
a reasonable estimate,but should
not be held out as a deadline.

“Due

Slots

by Duncan Nixon
Associate Sports Editor

 

 

This University is rapidly growing and improving,
and as it does so, it is hoped that the sports program's
development will keep pace. Present developments in-
dicate that such may very well be the case. Central
Council has already passed the budget for a sailing
club, that will be starting this spring, with both home
(and away Regattas. and Central Council will soon be
presented with a proposed lacrosse club budget, which
if passed. will mean that lacrosse will be starting next
year.

Although the prospects of our having football in the
near future have been dimmed by the state legislature's
cutting back on the hiring of new coaches, there still
is plenty of room for development. Our new gym which
is already being used for practice (by the basketball
and wrestling teams, and by the new swimming club)
provides excellent facilities to start from.

One good indication that expansion is taking place, is
the fact that the schedules for almost all sports are
slowly being stepped up. The cross country team faced
a strong field in the Albany Invitational this fall, and
they have scheduled Colgate for next season. The soccer
team is taking on powers like Bridgeport, the basketball
team has moved up. via its opening tournament, and the
wrestling team is also facing an increasingly difficult
schedule. And the same will probably be true of the
spring sports. Such acceleration is not easy for the
further up the university moves in caliber of opposition,
the more it has to face teams of composed scholarship
athletes.

The best indication of the direction thatthe University
will take with regards to its athletic policy, may very
well come from the University Athletic Council's) report
to the President which will be delivered on April 1.
The report will probably include recommendations on
football and other sports that might be initiated in the
future and it will also include proposals for future
scheduling and on the possibilities of future conference
membership. It seems quite likely that this report will
reflect the trend toward expansion and growth which is
mentioned above, and it is certainly hoped that if such
is the case, appropriate action will be taken to enact
such proposals.

One other development that also indicates the current
trend toward growth, is the recent establishment of pre-
liminary contacts with other area schools on the subject
of extramurals. Such a program'could easily tend to
elevate the sports involved to the level of clubs, thus
besides promoting competition between area schools,
which could conceivably be the forerunner of the de-
velopment of varsity teams in the sports involved.

F rosh Cagers Fall
Jordan Has 34, 30

by Joel Volinski

If one thing can be said for
the freshman basketball team, it
is that it doesn’t quit when be-
hind. However, that may be all
that can be said for them. Al-
though the frosh came back from
huge deficits in their games a-
gainst Junior College of Albany
and Oneonta, they still could not
pull them out. Their record now
stands at 2-9.

The J.C.A. game wasn’t a good
one for either club. Both teams
shot poorly and played sloppily.
The ridiculously low 32-16 half-
time score is evidence enough.
J.C.A. jumped to an 11-0 lead
quickly, but the fresh refused to
rush their game or play catch-
up ball. Using a deliberate brand
of ball, Albany prevented the
game from getting out of hand
and actually controlled the game
the rest of the half.

In the second half,.I.C.A. start-
ed to hit from the floor and ex-
panded their lead to 23 points
with only six minutes left. Al-
bany, using the full court press,
and behind the phenomenal shoot-
ing of Jack Jordan who gunned in
32 points in the second half alone,
knocked the lead to only 9 with
three minutes remaining. How-

ever, J.C.A. regainedtheircom-
posure and went on to win 70-57.

men’s swimming and diving
club is now practicing dailyfrom

pite the almost palatial atmos—
phere provided by the new

The team is badly in need 11
qualified backstroke and butter-

view of the fact that the swim-
ming club has two meets coming
up in' the near future.

The squad will travel to New
Paltz February 14 for anevening
meet, and than will travel to
Harpur Saturday March 2 for an
afternoon meet. . . .

The Oneonta game followed
quite the same pattern. Once,
again, because of poor shoot-
ing, rebounding and lazy defense,
the frosh were down 44—24 at the
half. And once again, using the
press, Albany came to within 7
points with nine minutes left.
From this point, it was a com-
bination of foul trouble, of-
ficiating, poor rebounding and
finally, hot shooting by the
Oneonta frosh which kept them
on top and led to a final score
of 89-75. Jordan once again led
Albany in scoring as he peppered
in 30 points. Les "Big Wayne"
Newmark hit for 15, HowieSmith
14, Joel Volinski 8 and Jim
Doyle 8.
