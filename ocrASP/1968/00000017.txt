editor,- but unfortunately l have learnedthroug'hiretro-
spect. My main desire as sports editor has been
to aid in improving any andall activities related to,
the athletic program at this university. I was privi-
leged to possess the instrument necessary in making
the university community aware of these activities.
Whether I have used this instrument well is question-
able, but 1 do feel that all praise given was deserved
while all criticism was sincere.

Originally, I pictured the athletic administration
as well as the school administration as being the
roadblock to the expansion of the university sports
program. By looking back at the improved sports
program, and by looking ahead at the future sports
program, I realize my error. Not enough can be said
concerning Dr. Werner's unending efforts at making
sports at this university equal to its academic rat-
ing. President Collins too has been an advocate of
an expanding sports program.

Expansion is, as" it is in professional sports, the
key word in a description of the university athletic
program. The faculty has grown in the past three
years with an excellent crop of young sports ment-
ors. Our track will be ready in the spring. Soccer,
cross-country and baseball are on the new campus.
Our long awaited gym will soon be ready. The bas-
ketball team has practiced there; the swimming pool
is finished; a. wrestling match is scheduled to be
held there, tomorrow! Swimming. track and field,
and fall baseball have been added to the schedules. A
most successful cross-country invitational has been in-
augurated, while a wrestling tourney has been continued.
Schools larger than all the Podunc States we are used
to playing have been added to the sports schedules.
Scholarship limitations are the only things which separ-
ate this university from big-time prestige.

It is with great pleasure that I may admire this
university‘s athletic growth, and it is with great re-
gret that 1 pass down this tool of communication.l
am confident, however, that Dunc Nixon’s craftman-

Grapplcrs’ Victory

by Tom Nixon

During the past week, the Great
Danes wrestling team recorded
its first victory, but also suffer-
ed its fourth defeat ofthe season.

On Tuesday, the grapplers
traveled to Brooklyn Poly where
they gained a 33-10 decision.
On Saturday, however, they were
defeated by Plattsburgh by a
score of 25-3. As a result of
these two matches, their record
now stands at one win and four
losses.

in amounting 33 points against
Brooklyn, the Great Danes gain.
ed six pins and one decision. Rog-
or Gotham recorded the fastest
pin as he forced the shoulders
of his opponent to the mats in 1:30.

Bill Russell, who was replac.
ing the injured Eric Watts in the
123-pound division, started the
match with a pin as he put his
man away in 2:42. Alex Domkow-
ski, who was also wrestling for
the first time, followed Russell
victory with a 4-1 decision over
Culligan of Brooklyn. Bill Clark,
in the 130 weight class, raised
his season record to 3-1 as he
gained‘a forfeit victory.

The next three weight divisions
were all won by pins for Albany
as Fran Waal pinned Abrami in
1:53 in the ids-pound division,

Craig Springer put away Mayer
in 6:20 at 152 pounds, and Frank
Berry defeated Dancak by pin-
ning him in 5:40. At 167, Marsh-
all Gladstone suffered the only
loss for an Albany wrestler as
he was pinned in 4:40. Roger
Gorham then finished out the
scoring for Albany with his pin.
At the heavyweight division, Al-
bany forfeited as Roger Saul,
who was at the spot transfer-
red at the end of the first se-
mester.

Against Plattsburgh, the only
winners for Albany were'Bill
Clark and Roger Gorham who
both recorded decisions in their
respective weight divisions.
Clark defeated Feeley by a 5-3
score and Gorham outscored
Fradenburg 13-5.

Bill Russell lost 11-4, Gary
Smagaiski was pinned at the 130.
pound class in 6:41, Fran Weal
lost 8:3, Craig Springer was
outscored 8-2, Frank Barry was
defeated by a 4-3 score, Mar-
shall Gladstone lost a (M de-

The grapplers have a home
match this Saturday which will

With a possible NCAA berth
waiting in the wings, the nightly-
ing Albany State Great Dane
basketsers, their win streak now
at nine, are home for the first
time in a month tomorrow night
against always tough Hobart Col-
lege at 3:30 pm. at the Cardinal

'McCloskey High School gym-
nasium. .

in games since last writing,
the Purple and Gold has upped
its record 'to 12-3, defeating in
succession Southern Connecticut,
33-30; 1211', 103-33; Stony Brook,
34-52; Potsdam, 74-33; and Har-
pur College, 75-39; lastTuesday,
the 200th win in Coach Dr. Ric-
hard Sauers' illustrious thirteen
year career.

Due to the installation of the
bleachers, the new gym will not
be ready to hold any home games
this season. Consequently, the
Siena game which was originally
scheduled for Saturday, February
17, has now been moved back to
Monday, the 19th at 3:00 p.m.

Hobart comes into the Albany
game with a deceiving 5-7 record.
Losers of three games by three
points or less, the men from
Geneva, N.Y. .are led by 3’3,’
sophomore Carmen Genovese
who is currently averaging over
22 points a game. Terry Hat-
maker, a 6'4" junior is Hobart’s
second leading point producer
at 17.4 ppg.

But the main attraction, as
usual, will be the shooting ability
and aggressiveness of the Danes,
currently averaging 33.3 points
a game as compared to 73.3 for
its opponents. Rich Margison,
Albany’s bonaflde Little All-
America, leads his team inscor-
ing at 22.2 ppg. The 3’1" junior
dominates the area's major col-
lege statistics in that he leads
the area in scoring and is second
in field goal percentage, free
throw percentage, and rebound-

g.

Backing up Margison in the
Albany attack is Scott Price, who
is the area's no. 1 rebounder
(10.7 a game) besides ripping
the cords at 16.7 a contest.

Jim "Super Sub” Cavcrly's
play has also been a big help in
the recent Dana drive. Caverly
leads area scorers infield goal
percentage (.559) and has come
off the bench consistently to spark
late drives. 1n the Potsdam game
last Saturday, the 6’ junior tallied
12 of Albany's 13 points within
five minutes as the locals widen-
ed their margin over the Bears
from two-points to eleven. Jim
finished the evening with 13
markers, hitting on nine rt 12
field goal attempts and grabbing
13 rebounds.

However, it has been Margi-

Conf. Topics

Dr. Clifton C. Thorns, Vice
President for Student Affairs,
answered questions on drug prob-
lems and student deferments
Monday at the President's Con-
ference in the absence of Dr.
Evan R. Collins, who was attend-
ing a meeting with Chancellor
Gould.

When questioned on whether
or not a student caught using
narcotics on campus would be
reported to the civil authorities,
Thorne replied, "Yes." He con-
tinued by citing as an examplean
incident which had occurred.

Last year there were several
student complaints about narcotic
users. The University staff ex-
plored all possibilities to dis-
cover the facts, but was unable
to Solve the dilemma. “Then,
and only then, we called in the
New York State Narcotics
Bureau."

The narcotics experts were
unable to catch "the two people"
concerned in the act. However,
during the investigation one flunk-
ed out and the other dropped out.

Dr. Thorne continued by point-
ing out that if an R.A. found
marijuana in a room, he must
report it to his superior. who in
turn would contact civil authori-
ties.

"If we see illegal activity, we
must do something about it,"
Thorne reiterated. However, he
went further to declare that "No
undercover agent will be allowed
on this campus without the ap-
proval of the Faculty and Stu-
dent governments. This measure
would only be taken if the situa-
tion became severe."

Comments were also made by
Dr. Thorne concerningthe recent
discontinuation of occupational
and graduate studentdefcrments.
He cited the reportof Dean Edgar
Fllnion of Graduate Studies. This
report stated that 50 per cent of
the 1963 graduates will not apply
to graduate school or complete
grad school. Also, 25 per cent of

“Students are not really that

Chancellor Speaks

On Dope, Athletics

by Carl Lindelnnn

Samuel B. Gould, Chancellor
of the State University of New
York, recently discussed future
athletic policy and issues con-
fronting the Statewide University
system emerging from the re-
cent narcotic raid at Stonybrook
University on Long Island at his
general meeting with student
leaders.

Chancellor Gould met with the
Student Association Presidents
of the four university centers
and representatives of the four
year colleges and Community col-
leges on Feb. 15, Thursday, at
his home in Albany, discussing
this issue.

Expressing concern over the
ramifications that the raid might
have on the growth and expansion
of the entire University system,
he cited two prime issuesemer-
ging.

One problem is the question of
whether the University is making
it difficult for law enforcement
agencies to investigate those
students in violation of existing
laws. A second consideration con-
cerns the belief by many indivi-

Council Acts On Election Bill;
Will Not Fund Political Groups

by Vic Looper

Central Council unanimously
approved a new election bill and
passed a policy prohibiting the
financing of partisan political
groups at its Feb. 15 meeting.
The election bill was approved
as the first by-law of the Stu-
dent Association. Council also
unanimously approved a com-
panion bill dealing with Elec-
tion Procedures.

The new election bill and pro-
cedures were drawn up by the
Election Commission of Douglas
Upham, Klaus Schnitzer, Henry
Made], R0 Cania, James Kahn
and Ralph Beisler) after a num-
ber of months of study and de-

flClﬁl in preventing such a case.

Vice President of Strident Af-
fairs, Clifton C. Thorne, said
that if you enumerate some things
specifically, you may leave out
others just as important. For this
reason general or fundamental
rules are more encompassing.

'l‘horno also said that general
rules offer more flexibility and
room for Sneclflc interpretation
of individual cases.

Dick Jnnkowsky, President of
Forum of Politics, felt that the
legal position of the University
should be clarified. lie said that
the student may considerthe Uni-
versity in loco parentis.

This, be implied, may be one
of the reasons on-campus stu-
dents do not have as many rights
as those off campus. "it is only
recently that the on-campus stu-
dent is coming to enjoy some of
the rights of the off-campus stu-
dents.

in reference to this point
Thorns said that the University
is reSponsibie (to the State) for
what happens on campus.

.lankowsky explained that an

hate. Together the bill and pro-
cedures represent a compre-
hensive revision of the old elec-
tion bill and make a consider-
able number of changes.

in the new bill, the Myskania
screening committee was en-
larged to include the chairman
of Pan Hellenic Council and the
chief justice of the Supreme
Court. All juniors were elimi-
nated from the committee in the
new bill including the President
of the Junior Class.

A person who is recognized
as the equivalent of a second
semester junior by the Univer-
sity, who is participating in an
affiliated program of study at
another unlversity,mny run for
MYSKANIA providing he pays
his student tux for the semesters
affected.

in Who's Who elections, first
semester transfers and fresh-
man cannot vote. The screening
committee for Who's Who is
similar to that of MYSKANIA
except that the President of the
Junior Class is included and
all seniors are eliminated from
the committee.

The new bill includes a pro-
vision that LAAC elections will
be regulated under the same
conditions as Council elections.
LAAC and the other commis-
sions are given iotnl autonomy
in determining the composition
of their boards.

The new bill also provides
for replacement uud run-off el-
ections and write-in votes (ex-
cept in MYSKANIA and Who's
Who elections whore write-ins
are invalid.) in the case ofwrite-
ins, no candidate shall be com
sidered elected until Election
Connnisslou certifies that he
meets the qualifications for
the position.

The election procedures go
into great detail concerning the
duties and responsibilities of
Election Commission, self nom-
inating procedures, and the com-
position, printing, distribution,
collecting and storage of bat-
lots.

They allow for the use of com-
puterized ballots and voting ma-

 

chines. The procedures involved
in voting, staff, processing of
voters and tabulation are spell-
ed out in detail.

In the case of irregularities
the Commission may ask the
Supreme Court or a lower court
with sufficient jurisdiction to in-
validate an election and mandate
a new one. The Commission by
a 2-3 vote of its membership
may also ask Council to can-
sure an individual for interfer-
ing with an election.

The election bill is the first
by-law of Student Association and
thus requiring a2—3vote of Coun-
cil for amendment or repeal.

The election bill was introduc-
ed as a by-law in order to give
the Supreme Court " broader
jurisdiction when deciding cases
of constitutionality. This prob-
lem was noted by President Jeff-
rey Mishkin, the chairman of
the Ad-hoc Judiciary Commit-
tee, during their deliberations

duals outside the University that
already existing University reg-
ulations are not being enforced.

This not only includes the use

of marijuana, LSD and narcotics
on campus, but also the viola-
tion of other University prohib-
ited activities. Although impor-
tant, he felt that the issue of
marijuana on campus is now a
secondary consideration. of
more immediacy and seriousness
is the threat of financial penal-
ties in the-form of cuts in Uni-
versity budgets.This will severe-
ly limit University growth and
expansion, according to Chan-
cellor Gould, at a very crucial
time. ,
Under the pressures of in-
vestigation by a Legislative com-
mittee Chancellor Could be-
lieves these questions must
first be answered. Public pres-
sure is also present.

Attending the meeting, Jeffrey
Mishkin, president of Student
Association on campus, stated
that Chancellor Gould believed
firmly in local autonomy of
each University center. Ha fur-
ther stated that it has been Chan-
cellor Gould’s attempt to give
each University center discre-
tion in making decisions. The
central office serving primarily
as an instrument of distributing
general guidelines for policy.

Student participation in for-
mulating policy was cited by
Mishkin as a second goal of
Chancellor Gould. But recent
events at Stonybrook have seri-
ously challenged both of these
goals. Both the public and state
legislature may new question the
validity of these goals.

Mishrin also cited that the is-
sue of marijuana and narcotics
on campus is still an important
issue. But, in concurrence with
Chancellor Could, he believesthe
priority of questions concerning
the possibility of the hindrance
of law enforcers by the Univer-
sity must be considered first.
Also present is the question deal-
ing with the possibility of lax-
ity in enforcing already exist-
ing University regulations.

The dangers of a breakdown
in communication between the
University Community and the
outside community must be
avoided, according to Mishkin.
