. Dr. Clifton C. Thorneannouno-
ed at Monday'- President's Con-
ference that the University has
deolded to institute a new pro-
cedure of advisement and pre-
registration for Fall 1960.

The decision came about after
much Investigation and discus-
sion with members ofthe faculty.

The new system of preregis- _
tration will be on an alphabetical
basis. Thorns questioned this
new system by saying "We al-
ways been in favor oi giving
priority to seniors and then to
underclassmen."

Theme also lpointed out that
die dilemma o prereglstration
systems is faced by many col-
lege. “if some one could devise
a workable system 01 preregis-
tration he would be set for life.”

Under the new system of ad-
visement, a student has the op-
portunity to see his adviser twice.
The first meeting is designed to
direct the student toward the
necessary courses for the com-
ing semester. The second meet-
ing prepares the student for pre
registration.

Under the new University sys-
tem students whose last namebe-
gins with the letter “K” may be-
gin to draw class cards on Mon-
day, April 8. No student will be
admitted to prereglstration
prior to the date specified for
his letter of the alphabet.

A list oi the courses to be
taught in the Fall is available
from the Registrar. The com-
plete schedule, showing days,
times, rooms, etc., will not be
available until March 15.

Teachers Draft Counseling
Formation Explained

The Teachers Draft Counsel-
ing Committee has been meeting
since late November to "study
the draft law and to explore the
moral and ethical issues" that
confront the students. The Com-
mittee was formed to provide
students with information about
all legal options under the draft
law and offer sympathetic coun-
seling about those policies.

The Committee in no way of-
ficially represents the Univer-
sity or its policies. it is simply a
group of individuals who offer
serious philosophical discussion

There are several misconcep-
tions about thecommittee which it
feels must be clarified. First,
the members of the Committee
are not in any uniform way "op-
posed to the draft." They mere-
ly feel a common concern for
students who are confused by a
dearth of information on thelegal
aspects of the draft.

Second. it is misleading to
refer to the Committee as an
"organization." The members,
“drawn together by a strong,
mutual concern, " found it neces-
sary and convenient to call meet-
ings and adopt an identifying
title. Only in this respect can
the Committee be called an "or-
ganiaatlon.”

Third, the word "counsel" is
also grossly misunderstood. The
Committee does not attempt to
persuade students to follow a
certain course, but to under-
stand themeelves and their op-

dissuade than it is to promote
defiance of the law."

it must be understood that
"faculty wishing to serve as
draft counselors forfeit none of
their civil and professional rights
and obligations. The Trustees'
Policies explicitly guarantee
them their rights to support
their moral and political con-
victions and use any lawful means
of persuading other citizens to
agree with them.”

Master’s Program

New Offered

by Janie Samuel:

A two year Master's Degree
program in Rehabilitation Coon.
sellng is currently under-way
under the auspices of the Depart-
ment of Guidance and Personnel
Services in the School of Educa-

tion.

Rehabilitation Counseling 15 8
recognised occupation which of-
fers trained counselors Oppor-
tunities for assisting disabled
persons ——physlcally. emotional-
ly, mentally and socially — with
their personal, occupational and
social adjustments. The role of
the "Rehap Counselor" overlaps
with other counseling profession-
als such as the social worker,
the psychologist, or the clergy.

The aim of the present pro-
gram is to train a "generalist"
in Rehabilitation Counseling
rather than limit the student's
experience to a particular dis-
ability group or to a specific
counselor role. Dr. Sheldon
Grand, Director of the program,
emphasizes the "clinical and
counseling orientation” of the
Albany curriculum. However, the
student is provided with a broad
range of knowledge which allows
for greater freedom in choosing
a job following training.

Aside from the traditional
counselor role. a variety of
opportunities exist for the Rehap
Counselor. Theseinciude the pro-
grammer who serves as a co-
ordinator of the various com-
munity devices that may benefit
the disabled client; the jobplace-
ment officer; and the vocational
evaluator who works in the Re-
habilitation Center or workshop
and assesses the vocational lia-
bilities and assets of the client.

Eleven full-time students are
currently working toward their
60 hour MA degree in Rehabilita-
tion Counseling here at Albany.
Because of the critical shortage
of Rehap Counselors, the pro-
gram is supported via grants
from the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare. Wash-
ington provides stipends of $1800
and an exemption tuition and fees
for first year students. Second
year students receive a stipend
of $2000 and similar exemptions.

Two kinds of course content
are emphasized in this MA pro-
gram: a basic academic curri-
culum and a professional curri-
culum. Classwork is heavily
psychologically oriented. Thirty
hours of "non-Rehap courses"
which aim to form a theoretical
basis for the students' needs
are provided by an interdiscip-
linary faculty from the Psycho-
logy Department the Educational
Psychology Department, the Gui-
dance Department, andtheSchool
of Social Welfare. These include
such courses as Statistics,
Learning, Theories of Per-
sonality, and Group and Com-
munity Organization Concepts.

Sanatation Strike
Elicits Response

The sanitation strike that New
York City has just endured has
elicited mostly negative re-
sponses at the Capitol. Most
legislators were quite disturbed
by Governor Rockefeller's inter-
vention in the strike.

Opposition came from lip-state
Republicans who abhor strikes by
public employes. Sen. Majority
Leader Earl W. Brydges (R.
Niagara Falls) considers lllese
strikes as lnsurrections.

Sen. Brydges attacked Mayor
John Lindsay's handling of the
strike on the floor of the Senate
and stated that Lindsay was try.
lng'to take credit for its ending
when Rockefeller ready deserved

Brydges stated that the Sanita-
tion Union broke the Taylor Law.
which forbids strikes by public
employes, but that they were pay-
ing for it in the loss of checkoff
privileges, a stiff fine, and im—
prisonment of their President.
John DeLury.

The Assembly and Senate have
both refused to take action on the
Governors' bill. as of press
time. This bill would allow the
state to step in when a strike
results in a health hazard, and
would employ those usually em-
ployed by the city to alleviate
the hazard in this case the garb.
age collectors. ,.

These employes would i‘eceivo
the same wages and all the bene-
fits under their regular contract
and the cost would be charged to
the city. If the city could not pay
the cost in the present fiscal
year. the state would advance
the money and deducting till!
amount from the next year's
state grant to the city.

Public reaction to the Gov-
ernor's intervention has been
rapid and harsh. The mail of
most legislators is highly critic-
al of the, Governor. One Capital
secretary stated that she has
received only one pro-Rocke-
feller letter.

The Governor has also in-
curred the wrath of nearly all
the newspapers in the state. Re-
publican leaders out of state
have also expressed disagree-
ment. Gov. Ronald Reagan of
California stated that Rocke-
feller has destroyedthe principle
of home rule by his actions in
the strike.

Others have accused him of
creating disrespect for law and
order. The charge of playing
politics for the Presidential
nomination was also levied
against the Governor.

While Jankowsky was primari-
ly interested in the rights of stu-
dents as citizens of the United

versity supplies the student with
benefits that he would not receive
as a citizen outside the Univer-

Thorne referred toiheoositlon
of the student involved in a bar-
room brawl where treatment
would be more lenient of a col-
lege student than a non—college
student.

Dr. Johnston of the Education
Deparimeni said that the AAUP
statement was disappointing in
that ii avoided the central issues
which he believes to beihe funda-
mental cbanges inking place in
Universities.

"American Universities are
ceasing to be schools they are
becoming institutions of national
service. They are becoming in-
struments of manpower manage
ment; their primary [ask is to
develop technicians.

H'l‘he University has become a
business which sells contract re-

Dr. ’i‘hornc also corrected a
misquote concerning University
drug policy which armouredinihc

Union. A corrected statement
was printed in the February 10
issue.

That the authorities have al-
ways supplied you with your
rights in the pasi,and you have
not expected any more than what
they gave you, may indicate that
the future will be the same way.

Thorne was asked ifihelibcral
policies advocated in the slate-
meni would evoke strong reac-
tions from parents. Thorne said
he did not think so and referred
to the reaction of parents to the
liquor policy and women’s hours
which was minimal.

“l was appalled at the neces-
sity of preparing such a state-
ment," said ’i‘horne. lie alluded
to the AAUP statement that,
“Under no circumstances should
a student be barred from admis-
sion to a particular institution

fortunate," he said, “that such a
statement had to be made.”

The Reverend i-‘rank Snow

was as a result of State Law.
