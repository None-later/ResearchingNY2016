Ten people were arrested, pro.
testing the presence of the Dow

_ Chemical Corporation on the Uni-

v'ersity campus last Wednesday.
They were: Carol Crandell, Rich
Goldsmith, Georgia Lee, Mary
Leue, Peter and Sally Pollak,
Gail Roberts, Stefanie Teitel,
Brett Wakefield, James Whitney.
Their basis for action was the
petition submitted to President
Collins which stated in part:

“We submit that the DowChem-
icai Corporation, manufacturer
of napalm, which is being used
daily in Vietnam, is in viola-
tion of the moral and humanprin-

ciples to which this university
subscribes.” ,

We submit tint the Dow Cor-
poration should not have the right
to interview or hire on this cam-
pus employees who maybeassist-
ing in the production of murder-
ous and illegal weapons. We feel
that only a debate or discussion
on the use of naplam would be
acceptable as an exercise in
free speech."

We further submit that should
the university permit this repre-
sentative to hold interviews now
or anytime in the future so long
as Dow is the manufacturer or

University Named Nat’l Test Center

The University has been de-
signated as a test center for
administering the National
Teacher Examinations on April
6, 1968.

The designation of the Univer-
sity as a test center for these
examinations will give prospec-
tive teachers in this area an
opportunity to compare their per-
formance on the examinations
with candidates throughout the,
country who take the tests.

College seniors preparing to
teach and teachers applying for
positions in school systems which
encourage or require applicants
to submit their scores on the
National Teacher Examinations
along with other credentials are
eligible to take the tests.

At the one day session a can-

didate may take the Common
Examinations which include tests
in Professional Education and
General Education, and one of
the thirteen Teaching Area Ex-
aminations, which are designed
to evaluate his area of under-
standing oi the subject matter
and methods and applicable to
the area he may be assigned to

SUNYA students.

At the President’s Press Con-
ference, Monday at 2:15 Clifton
Thorns Vice-President for Stu-
dent Affairs commenting upon the
petition, stating "President Col-
lins said that 'such an action
(barring recruiters) would inter-
fere with the intellectual freedom

The petition requested the in-
vitation to Dow be withdrawn
or in compliance with their state-
ment of beliefs (above) the stu-
dents would have to protest. Dr.
Thorns answered by endorsing
the statement adopted by the
University Council on Dec. 14,
1967, which states in part:

"Students, like other mem-
bers of the University, are free
within the law to manifest, pro-

manner that does not seek to
restrain the freedom of expres-

The Albany State Young Amer-
icans for Freedom will present
the first of a series of ten lec-
tures on Communism, Wednes-
day evening, February 28, at
7:30 p.m. in Lecture Room No.
3. The series is entitled "Com-
munism: The most Dangerous

This series will be an in depth
study of the political, social,
economic, ideological
aspects of Communism. A com-
plete schedule of the series is
posted in the main academic
buildings.

Tibor Baranski, a teacher at
Albany Academy, will deliver the
complete series. Born in 1922,
he is of Hungarian nationality
and is now an American citizen.
When World War II broke out.
he was a student at the Univer-
sity of Kassa in what used to be
northern Hungary.

Near the end of the war, Baren-
ski received a Special letter of
commendation from the Vatican
City diplomatic representative to
Hungary for his part in protect-
ing and saving over 3,000 Jews
from Nazism.

After the war, Baranski re
turned to Budapest and attended
the Pazmany Peter University
from which he received his Ab-
solutorium in June 1948 (roughly
equivalent to a Master's degree).

Before he could complete his
doctorlal work. Baranskl was
arrested by the Russians and
was sentenced to nine years for
spying and six years for con-
spiracy. However, when Stalin

in the fall of 1956, the Hun.
garian Revolution broke out.
Baranskl was an active Freedom
Fighter. After leaving the country
to try to obtain foreign assis-
tance, Baranski was notified that
the Revolution had failed.

Wanted for his political activi-
ties. Baranski would not return
to his homeland. He therefore
traveled throughout EurOpc giv-
ing lectures on the Revolution
and Communism. in 1957 hemov-
ed to Canada, and in 1061 be
came to the United States with
his wife, a biochemist.

Baranskt is presently working
on his doctorate degree and is
the author ofthe forthcoming hook
"Twelve Years of Hungary in the
Mirror of My Life." A student of
ancient and modern languages,
history and philosophy, Baran-
ski states: "Although my heart
beats quite often for my old
country, i promised God i shall
love my second homeland, the
United States, just as 1 love
Hungary."

Bank Receives
Research Grant

Dr. Shelton Bank, associate
professor of chemistry at tho
University has received a $23,-
400 grant from the National
Science Foundation for research
entitled, "Reduction and Addi-
tion Reactions of Aromatic
Radical Anions."

Bank, who joined the Univer-
sity faculty in 1966, long has
been interested in the chemistry
of the highly reactive intermedi-
ates which have been studied
rarely. They have, according
to Bank, a considerable synthe-
tic potentlal as the reactions
are remarkably selective. Pre-
paration of the anions is simple
and their yields with a given
substrate are often high.

The grant, given for a two-
ycar period ending December
31, 1060, provides for the
salaries of two graduate assis-
tants.

STB President
Clariﬁes Assoc.
To All Rushesz

A statement in the pamphlet.

“Join the Brown and GoldRush,"
a fraternal rush booklet put out
by STB, has caused some ques-
tions about the fraternities af-
filiation with other fraternities
about the state. To answer these
(piesiions William Cleveland,
president of STD, has written
the following letter.

To all male rushces:

At this time I feel it is im-
perative that we clear up a pos.
sible misunderstanding result-
ing from an article in the pam-
phlet “Join the Brown and Gold
Rush." The Brothers of Sigma
Tau Beta do not want to create
any false impressions — be they
good or bad — to do so we feel
would not be in the keeping with
the spirit of fair rushing as out-
lined in the i.F.C. Rush Rules.

The point we wish to clarify
concerns the statewide”associa-
tion" of Sig Tau. On October 8,
1953 the Board of Trustees of
the State University of New York
passed a resolution concerning
affiliation "with any national or
other organization outside the
particular unit.” Such affiliation
is not permitted by the Board’s
resolution.

We feel that the process of ex-
changing ideas is a most bene-
ficial educational experience.
This is the aim of our "associa-
tion" and through corres-
pondence and visits to other Sig
Tau's we have picked up inval-
uable information concerning
programming, rushing, pledg-
ing, and other fraternal activi-
ties. There is no formal affilia-
tion among the groups —— nor
can there be. it is strictly for-
bidden by the 1953 Board of
Trustee's resolution. We plan
to cultivate this concept of ex-
changing ideas as being benefi-
cial for the growth and mainten-
ance of all groups concerned. in
this sense the spirit of"Sig Tau”
runs high.

Thank you for your attention;
1 hope this will clarify a some-
what confusing issue.

Very truly yours,
William Cleveland
President Sigma
Tau Beta

Charges of Non cooperation

Leveled at Stony Brook

by Daniel Lesser

NEW YORK (CPS) — Charges
of non-cooperation by university
administrations and "Gestapo-
like" police tactics were aired
here last week as two New York
legislative committees began in-
vestigating the use of drugs on
campus.

The investigation grew out of
a Jan. 1'7 raid at the State Uni-
versity of New York at Stony
Brook in which 21 students were
arrested on various drug
charges,

The Joint Legislative Commit-
tee on Crime heard Suffolk Coun-
ty Police Commissioner John
Barry testify that school offic-
ials at Stony Brook had not been
informed of the impending raid
because they had refused to co-
operate with the poilce in the
past.

was announced that Doug-
las Upham, the present election
commissioner, had resigned. Up-
on the recommendation of
Upham, Mishkin appointed Ro
Cania Election Commissioner,
effective after the MYSKANlA
elections. Henry Made] was ap-
pointed interim commissioner
untll that time.

Gary Gold, the chairman ofthe
Ad-hoc committee on Political
Speakers, presented his report
to Council. The report stated
that partisan political groups
should not be funded, provided
for political speakers, films
etc. and set up an executive
board to administer a speaker
program and determine if speak-
ers are partisan or not.

The committee [)ltill states that
Forum of Politics would contin-
us in an educational, non-par-
tisan manner. Partisan groups
would not be funded but should
be self supporting. Community
programming commission (CPC)
would be given it budget line
for partisan speakers, under
this proposal.

The Executive liourd would be
composed of six members: one
fit-largo non-voting member of
CPC and one member with from
SDS, YAl-‘, Young iicps, Young
Dems, and Forum of Politics.

Four out of five voters would
he needed in order to approve
it speaker. Thus, Gold stated
that the groups would have to co-
operate. The alternatives would
be to have no speakers at all
or to have a balanced progrqu
of speakers. Mildred Poison-
ski, the Commission Chairman,
stated that this report was
favorable to CPC.

Council took immediate action
on part of (lold's report by pass-
ing in bill (210-1) which states

that no partisan political groups
shall be funded. The bill also
rescinded YAF's budget.

Council took action on a num—
ber of other bills: appropriat-
ed $250 to Revue to pay for a
harpist; and passed a Tax Card
exemption which would allow a
candidate in the upcoming elec-
tion to present a check for the
amount of student tax in lieu of
a tax card.

Council also defeated a bill
which would have asked AA Board
or the appropriate committee
to draw up specific plans for
the introduction of new sports
with probable dates a nd cost
estimates and sent a loan policy
back to finance committee for
consideration.

LAAC announced that it had
passed a proposal to keep all
flagrooms open 24 hours a day.
This will not take effect un-
til it has been through the nec»
essary channels.

Poetry Contest

The National Poetry Press
has recently announced its spring
competition for the College Stu-
dent's Poetry Anthology. The
closing date for the submission
of manuscripts by college stu-
dcnis is April 10, 1908.

Any student attending either
junior or senior college is el-
igible to submit her verse. There
is no limitation as to form or
theme but shorter works are
preferred by the Board of Judges
because of space limitations.

Each poem must be typed or
printed on a separate sheet,
and must bear the name and
home address of the student,
and the college address as well.

Munusaripts should be sent
to the National Poetry Press;
3210 Selby Ave.; Los Angeies,
Cuiif., 90084.

Toll denied the charges, and ex-
plained how each example of non-
cooperation was in fact an ex.
ample of attempts to work with
the police officials.

Especially at issue was an in-
cident that took place in March
when the police received an
anonymous tip that a "pot party"
was taking place on the cam.
pus. President Toll testified that
the incident was an attempt to
frame an associate dean, who
found a packet containing marl.
juana placed under his door.

Commissioner Barry claimed
that the administration had warn-
ed at the alleged part that the
raid was to take place. Refut.
ing Barry's testimony step by
step, Toll claimed that "1 know
1 can neverlive with theimpres-
sion that was given by the claims
against the university."

The committee came under
criticism for hearingdefamatory
testimony publicly without first
determining its validity in pri-
vate and Senator John H. Hughes,
the chairman, admitted that the
committee had permitted hearsay
evidence to be aired.

The committee was accused of
"smear" tactics by a lawyer
representing 12 Stonv Brook fac.
ulty members, who have figured
in a grand jury inquiry into
drug use by the Stony Brook
faculty and obtained a court or-
der to prevent them from being
subpoenaed by the committee.

At the other hearing, the Joint
Legislative Committee on Educa.
cation heard criticisms of police
tactics used in the Stony Brook
raid.

American Civil Liberties Un-
ion rspresentative Hyman Her-
man said that police had violat-
ed a Section of the state penal
code by disclosing secret in-
dictments against the students
to the press before they had
been taken into custody. lie also
criticized the police for allow-
ing the press to accompany them
on the raid and to take pictures
of the arrests on the grounds that
most of the students qualified
for youthful offender status.

Assemblyman Joseph Kottler
questioned Commissioner Barry
on the contents ofa lO’7-page mim-
cographed tactical plan for the
raid entitled “Operation Stony
Brook." The plan contained per-
sonal information on each of the
subjects and was made avail-
able to members of the press
at u briefing before the pre-
duwn raid.

Barry explained that the (ior-u.
msnt had only been circulated to
police officials, but that one copy
had been carried away by a re-
porter. An unnamed newspaper
has since published a "book" re-
view of the report.Kottler claim.
ed that Time and Newsweek maga-
zines had also been furnished
copies of the document.

Dr. Perry D. Westbrook, a
member of the English depart-
ment, has recently published a
now], “Mary Wilkins Freeman."
it was published by Twayne's
United States Authors, English
Authors, and Masterworks of Lit-
erature Series.

Twayne's series is a publish-
ing corporation with academic
people as editors. The Series
is focused on American writ-
ers and has covered over 200
authors of American literature.
it has been in existence for the
past several years.

Westbrook earned his under-
graduate degree and Ph.D. from
Columbia University, where he
also earned membership in Phi
Beta Kappa. He has been on the
faculty of the University since
1945. Before this Westbrook
taught at the University of Kan-
sas, Georgia Tech, and the Uni-
versity of Maine.

Westbrook has an established
reputation as a critic of Ameri-
can literature. ln 1951, he pub-
lished "Acres of Flint: Writers
of Rural New England 1870-
1900." He has written mystery
novels, five of which have been
published, and has contributed
to the l'lvlystery Writers Hand-
book." He is also the author of
"Biography of an island" (Yose-
loff, 1958) written under a Gug-
genheim fellowship and "The
Greatness of Man: An Essay
on Dostoyevsky and Whitman."
(Yoseloff, 1961).

in "Mary Wilkins Freeman,”
Westbrook has attempted to pro-
vide a comprehensive picture of
her as one of the best of allwrit-
ers of New England life. Mary
Wilkins Freeman was of Puritan
Salem ancestry. She spent more
than half of her life in her birth-
place, the village of Randolph,
Massachusetts and in Brattle-
boro, Vermont. She married a
Dr. Freeman, of New Jersey,
and went to live in that state
for the remaining years of her
life. Her reputation rests on
her earlier books, notably "A

Being an acute observer of lo-

chose to focus on repressed per-

setting, realistically showing
much of the ugliness of life.,Mary
Wilkins Freeman especially
probed into the complexities of
the mind, emphasizing the con-

Mary Wilkins Freeman today

Grad. Ag. Studies
Part Of Service
For Peace Corps

A special program combining
graduate agricultural studies
with Peace Corps service will
be started next fall on the Uni-
versity of California Campus at
Davis.

Beginning next September, nine
months of graduate study will
be offered, including one month
of intensive language training and
followed by two years of serv-
ice as a Peace Corps Volun-
teer.

The first group will be as-
signed to lndla where the Peace
Corps has its largest agricul-
ture program, consisting of about
1,000 volunteers. Most of the
volunteers are liberal arts grad-
uates given special intensive ag-
riculture training in a specific
skill such as crop production
or poultry raising.

Those who go through the Cal-
Davis program will be assigned
to agricultural colleges in indie
to work with their research and
extension staffs. They will carry
on adoptive research and demon-
strations of appropriate agricul-
tural practices as well as assist
farmers by introducing progress.
ive agriculture methods.

Applicants must meet thestan-
dards of both the Peace Corps
and the graduate division of the
University of California College
of Agriculture and Environment-
al Science at Davis.

in addition to students with de-
grees in agriculture or a sci-
ence, liberal arts graduates with
strong backgrounds in science or
agriculture, are also eligible the
Peace Corps said.

The program at Cal-Davis will
count toward a graduate degree
in such fields as agricultural

economics and management,
animal sciences, international
agricultural development, plant
sciences and protection, and soil
and water sciences.

The Peace Corps will pay for
the instructional costs, provide
a subsistence allowance for the
third quarter of study at the
university.

Loans, scholarships and fel.
lowships are also available, the
agency said.

Application forms may be ob-
tained from the international Ag-
ricultural Institute at Cal-Davis
and must be filed by May 1 of
this year.
