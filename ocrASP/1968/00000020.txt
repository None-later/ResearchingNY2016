WHY CAN'T ALL the lights stay up like this?

Dope, Athletics Confronted
By Gould At Conference

(Coni'd from Page I)

communications between each
University center and the Board
of Trustees of the State Uni-
versity system is another prob-
lem.
Mishkin stated that "in my
opinion, the University Council
will be reluctant to approve any
further liberalization in this time
of stress.”

The policy governing the con-
duct of physical education and
athletic programs at state-oper-
ated campuses was also discus-
sed at the meeting. At their meet-
ing on Nov. 9, 1987, the State
University Trustees adopted a
policy concerning this aspect of
University life for the 1968-69
academic year.

Concerning intercollegiate
athletic activities, the Board (I
Trustees decided that "the Uni-
versity shall devote to intercol-
legiate athletic activities ashare
of its total financial resources
proportionate to the best inter-
ests of all students in the three-
day program of physical educa-
tion, recreation, and athletics."

in a later memorandum sent
out from the Office of the Chan-
cellor to Presidents oi the State
University of New York on Dec.
26, 1967, it was further explain-
ed that “. . . it may be possible
in the future to gain complete
financial support for the inter-
collegiate athletic program."

However, it was stressed that
for the present "it is not real-
istic to submit supplemental bud-
gets to cover the complete cost
of athletic programs, given the
current gap between State in-
come and expenditure."

At the recent meeting of
Chancellor Gould and Student
leaders, Dr. Boyer, vice chan-
cellor for University - Wide Ac-
tivity, refused to be pinned down
on this topic. Mishkin stated that
"he refused to be pinned down,
but intimated for the fiscal year
1908-00 that the State University
would not be assuming any fi-
nancial burden for the athletic
program."

A third topic discussed at the
meeting was the explanation why
student tax may not be made
mandatory. Under present state
law any fees made by the Uni-
versity must go to the General
income fund of the State Uni-
versity.

The General income fund is
under the control of the Con-
troller of New York State. if
student tax was declared a fee,
students would lose all au.
tonomy of spending.

According to Mtshkin, we are
comparatively in better shape
in amount of funds available for
student activities than other
University centers. He felt that

many Student Association Pres-
idents would like to see the law
changed in regard 'to'putting
all fees under the category of
General income fund.

However, Chancellor Gould
felt this would befutile at the
present time.

Schools Dominating

In Rhoads Scholarships

(CPS) Last December, when
the names of the winners of the
1987-68 Rhodes Scholarship com-
petition were announces, it turn-
ed out that half the 32 recipients
came from 4 schools, Harvard,
Yale, Dartmouth and Princeton.

These ivy Leagueschools made
a much stronger showing than
they had a year before, but a
study ofthe history of theScholar-
ships shows that the ivy schools,
particularly Harvard, Yale, and
Princeton have dominated the
program since its inception in
1903. The question is why?

The Scholarships, which fi-
nance two years of study at 0x-
ford College in England for each
recipients, are the most prestigi-
one by far of theawards available
to college graduates in this coun-
try. A Rhodes is widely regarded
as a ticket into the Establishment.

The head of the Rhodes trust
in this country is CourtneySmith,
also the president ofSwarthmore
College. in 1960, Smith wrote
an article for the American Ox-
onian, a bi-monthly magazine for
American Rhodes scholars, in
which he gave five reasons for
the dominance of certain ivy
League schools.

These reasons are: l) These
schools are of high quality 2)
they attract the best students
from all over the country (the
students can apply for scholar-
ships from their own home town
selection committee) a) they have
close student-faculty relations
(applications are given aid and
encouragement, and detailed in-
formative letters are written
about them) 4) the schools rely to
a large extent on seminars and
tutorials (giving the students
more ability to talk and handle
ideas than they would get from
large lecture courses) and 5)
the schools have a strong tradi-
tion of encouraging Rhodes appli-
cations. ,

Whether or not Smith's reasons
for the ivy dominance of the
Rhoda's program are valid, it is
clear that the state colleges and
universities have been at the
opposite end of the Rhodes' spec-
trum from the ivy League
schools.

Although more than 60 per
cent of all college students new
graduate from state-supported in-
stitutions, their share of the
Rhodes’ Scholarships has been
and still is minimal. This past

Beckett’s Godot

Dr. William Alfred, professor
of English at Harvard Univer-
sity and author of the off-Broad-
way hit, I'Hognn's Goat," will
lecture Thursday evening, Feb-
ruary 29, at the University. ills
topic will be "Tragic Concentra-
tion in Beckett’s 'Waiting for
Godot’." .

Professor Alfred will be the
third lecturer in the 1907-08
series sponsored by the depart-
ment of English at the Univer-
sity. The event, open to the pub-
lic, is scheduled for 8:15 in the
Campus Center Assembly room.

"Hogan's Goat," which had an
off-Broadway run of more than
a year, is Scheduled to be film-
ed. Another work of Professor
Alfred, a translation of "Beo-
wulf," has been published by
Random House Modern Library.

year, state university students
won '7 out of 32 scholarships.

An estimation has been made
that a Rhodes' applicant from an
ivy League school or one of the
service academies has a l in 250
chance of winning a award. A
candidate from a state univer-
sity has 1 chance in 48,000.

One belief is that many stu-
dents shy away from applying
because they believe the com-
petition is too hard, and others
who might otherwise apply, can't
because they're married.

Several State University stu-
dents who have applied in the
past have come back feeling that
the ivy League candidates were
no brighter, but more polished.

It is felt by some state Univer-
sity Rhodes' representatives,
that the product that comes outof
the private schools has the oppor-
tunity to he coached, and to get
help in writing his application.

Whether or not thebad showing
made by the State Universities is
a result of deficiencies in the
Rhodes' program, it doesn't ap-

pear that the program is likely
to be revised.

The selection system tends to
perpetuate itself because all
members of thedistrictselection
committees are Rhodes scholars
except the chairman. it would be
surprising if the committees did
not lean to applicants who are
well-spoken and poised as they
themselves are.

Since ivy League applicants,
for reasons already noted, tend to
possess‘ihese qualities, they con-
sistently make the best impres-
sions on the selection com-
mittees.

if the state universities are
going to win a greater share of
the Scholarships, more effort on
their part might help. At Harvard,
each of the 10 undergraduate
houses have a Rhodes’ represen-
tative, which r bviously helps the
university as a whole get the
Scholarships.

in the long run though, it's
difficult to see how the Rhodes
Scholarships can be distributed
more freely unless the selection
method is reformed.

Tutoring Program
Aids Disadvantaged

by Richard Hancock
The "Project
on Education of the Disadvant-
aged” is convinced that each one
that attends high school does not
have an equal opportunity to get
into college and,notonly convinc-
ed, is determined to do some-
thing about it.
in part the project is funded
by the federal government and
works with local school admin-
istrators, supervisors, and
teachers, but perhaps the most
important branch is the A.C.E.
tutoring program which Works
with the high school student him-

self.

Action for Cultural Enrich-
ment (ACE) was formulated on
the premise that boys and girls
from a lower socio-economic
background fail to get into col-
lege, not because of a lack of
intelligence or ability, but a lack
of cultural opportunities and ex-
periences.

Even LQ. tests assume amini-
mum and, infortunately for these
high school students, at the pre-
sent a middleclass culture base.
For this reason, ACEtutors have
the dual responsibility not only
to tutor in specific subjects, but,
as much as possible, to expand
the horizons of his not-so-much-
younger students, to help them
to interact (perhaps for the first
time) in organized social activi-
ties, and to inspire in them an
interest in education beyond just
passing.

This could never be accom-
plished by remote control, but
only on a personal, or as nearly
personal as possible basisIACE
believes that there is no sub-
stitute for a one-to-one relation-
ship of openness and trust be-
tween student and tutor.

This is far from an easy task.
First, there is not much time
(only one or two hours out of
the afternoon twice a week, and
that after a hard day of classes

for both student and tutor.)

And building such a relation-
ship is work, not physical labor,
but a particular kind of alert-

ness that is very demanding; de-

manding on the tutor, for he is
the one that must set the pace
and deliver the goods.

it is he that must open him~
self to his student, make the pro-
gram he presents meaningful to
him, and produce some visible
results. And building such a re-
lationship is demanding on the
student, for tilts friendship must
be returned by him.

The student may or may not
be inclined to do so, or may
(for some reason or another) be
afraid, or just may not under-
stand anything about friendship
on other than the most superfi-
cial level.

This is the ideal. The outcome
depends on the tutor, his imagine.
tion, his patience, trial and error
amt not too many errors or the
student will lose interest), his
enthusiasm, the situation, and
perhaps most of all, his under-
standing of people, his insight
into motives, reactions, and
dreams of the high schoolcr.

This is a competition, a race
to be won, against time, against
deep-seated habits and attitudes,
against circumstances no No of
which can be alike or can be an-
ticipated. The tutor will see just
how much imagination, patience,
and perception he has.

He will learn from his fellow
tutors who are also competing.
And he will learn just how much
he does care.

At present, over 30 students
are employed by the University
through work-study program, but
more are needed. if a University
student is qualified and interested
in the important business of tutor-
ing disadvantaged high school stu-
dents, he may inquire about pro-
ject ACE at room 124 in the
Education Building.

“Camelot” Showing to Fund

Scholarship Program

A showing of the film, "Came-
lot” at the Madison Theatre will
be the first event sponsored by
the University Student Scholar-
ship Committee to fund its schol-
arship program. The special
showing will be next Thursday,
February 29 at 8:30 p.m.

Tickets for the performance
may be bought in the Campus
Center main lobby each day from
11 a.m. to 3 p.m. until Tuesday.
Tickets also may be purchased
by contacting Terry Mathias in
Stuyvesant l804 at 457-7976.
Price is $2.50 per ticket.

Recipients of the scholarship
this year were Fred Childs and
Richard Epstein. Applications for
the scholarship, which is given
according to need and academic
ability, will be available late
in March.

The fund was initiated by the
prize money ($500) last year's

G. E. College Bowl team earned.
This money, which must be used
for scholarships, was given to
students to award.

To perform this functicn Aca-
demic Affairs Commission
named Mathias as chairman of
the University Student Scholar-
ship Committee. Other mem-
bers are Thalia Perdaris, Nancy
LePore, Betsy Morris and John
Towler.

The benefit showing off'Came-
lot" is the first project under-
taken by the committee to achieve
its goal of making $500 this year.
Since each present scholarship
amounted to $200 the extra money
is needed to continue the program
next year.

The committee is run entirely
by students except the examina-
tion of confidential financial in.
formation, which is done by fin-
ancial aids.

In Criminal Justice

by Ira Wolimon

"An opportunity for young peo-
ple to become involved with one
of the most serious social prob-
lems of our time" is what awaits
the prospective graduate student
who enrolls in the newly formed
School of Criminal Justice here
at the Univeristy, stated Richard
A. Myren, Dean of the School.

A school of Criminal Justice
was authorized for the State Uni-
versity of New York at Albany on
March 11, 1965. The idea for
such a school had beenunder cori-
sideration for many years.

When this plan was originally
conceived, consideration was
given to placing the school in
one of the three other SUNY cen-
ters (Harpur, Stony Brook, Buffe-
lo), but because of the huge gov-
ernmental center here, the plans
were made with Albany in mind.

This past year, Dean Myren
was told to establish the ground-
work for a school that would be
a high caliber graduate school.
He, along with five other pro-
fessors, has spent the 1967-68
acadmeic year preparing for the
start of a functioning program,
by organizing course outlines
and doing additional research in
the criminal justice field.

Among those considered to be
the finest minds in the field of
criminal justice in the nation
have been invited here to assist
Dean Myren. Starting next year,
the school will be accepting its
first graduate students. Accord-
ing to Myren, the "School is
heavily research oriented, with
an emphasis on the Ph.D. pro-
gram. M.A. degrees will also be
granted.

Dean Myren stated that the
school looked for three very
important qualities in each pro-
fessor before he was appointed.
First, an adequate completion of
studies, indicated by a Ph.D. was
strongly urged. Second, the pros-
pective professor must have

proven research ability which has
been "published and subjected to
the criticism of his peers."
Third, he must be one of these
people " with an interest in crime
and the solutions to it."

The school bulletin stated that
“This program is necessarily
experimental. There is no exact
prototype on which to model, no
Council on Criminal Justice Edu-
cation from which to seek ad-
vice.” Precedents will be estab-
lished that’ will be followed for
years to come.

The composition of the student
body, it is hoped, will inciudetop
notch students. Myren statedthat
he is expecting an "internation-
al student body” to be attending
this school when plans are com-
pleted.

The New York City Police De-
partment has made plans to send
a man on full salary, to study
here. Myren said he expected
80 per cent of the student body
to be new graduate students,
fresh from college, and 20 per
cent to be accomplished pro-
fessionals, who wish to better
prepare themselves for their
positions in the system.
