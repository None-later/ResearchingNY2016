New Registration

Once again this semester we find that
the administration has instituted a new
preregistration process in another attempt
to alleviate the mad rush of students to
grab seats in too few sections of too few
courses. The administration tries hard but
their newest proposal, we feel, is a step
in the wrong direction.

This new system allows all students to
complete academic advisement before any
class cards may be drawn, avery positive
move, but then negates this plus by setting
up an alphabetical plan for the drawing
of class cards. The plan favors the lucky
people with last names beginning with K
through approximately S and leaves the
others out in the “get signed in to closed
sections if you can" cold.

Chosen to eliminate the problem of
freshmen and sophomores closed out of
courses because they have been filled by
juniors and seniors, the system not only
fails to correct this problem but further
increases the propability of juniors and
especially seniors being closed out of the
sections they have to take to graduate on
time.

Therefore we would like to suggest our
own preregistration plan:

1— draw up and issue the class schedule
during the middle of the second month of
the semester based on demand for courses
and other considerations based on data for
the previous semester.

2—allow four (4) weeks for academic
advisement before class cards may be
drawn.

3— have each advisor obtain from each
advisee an exact copy of his approved
schedule card with all information called
for filled in.

4— allow one (1) week for the tabula-
tion of this data by class year and sec-
tion number (employing secretaries and
faculty wives for this purpose (about 20
people in all.)

5— send tabulated data to departments
for any adding, dropping and enlarging of
sections deemed necessary and feasible
on the basis of this data (allow one week
for changes to be made, mimeoed, and
posted.)

6— open class card drawing according
to class year beginning with seniors,
juniors, etc., and according to major and
minor departments. Under this plan all
students would draw class cards first in
their major and minor fields.

7-- open general class card drawing
to students in the following order:

freshmen and sophomores with open

   
 
   

majors
all other sophomores

all other freshmen

all seniors

all juniors

8— open general card drawing to all
students for the final two days before
packet turn-in.

9- final packet turn-in one day after
the close of class card drawing.

ln steps 6 and 7 class card drawings
would be open to each group mentioned
for approximately three (3) days.

This plan would not be fully effective
the first semester it was instituted,
especially in the case of the first step.
However, data collected through the stu-
dents' class schedule cards would be used
the second semester of operation in making
up the class schedule. This would also
eliminate the need for many changes by
the departments after the schedule had
been ublished.

Dow On Campus

The request that the administration
bar Dow Chemical representatives from
recruitment on this campus is in direct
opposition to the rights and privileges
guaranteed under the “open campus"
policy of this university. This policy
includes the right of any student to meet
with any person of his choosing for any
legal activity.

The "open campus" also encompasses
the right to peaceful demonstration. Such
a demonstration, we feel, is one legiti-
mate way of making one’s feelings on
an issue known to the general public,
one way of making changes in disliked

situations.
in the case in point, however, the

change sought should not be in the lib-
eral, freedom granting policy of the
“open campus" but in the operation of
the Dow Chemical and other war-orient-
ed corporations. The destruction of a
basic freedom is an extremely high price
to pay for the remote possibility of con-
vincing Doe to cease making napalm.

Through peaceful demonstration, con-
cerned persons can bring this issue into
the public eye, convincing others of the
legitimacy of their complaint. if the re-
cruiters were barred, there would be no"
such demonstration, no broader scope
of concern would be possible, no further
pressure would be brought to bear on
Dow, and the company, and others like
it, would simply go to another campus
to recruit employee. Such a development
would, in fact, hurt the cause of those
who wish to put an end to the manufac-
ture of products like napalm.

Good By "Graduates

General Lewis B. Harshy has issued another directive

s.....,r,.n....iza; I968

to all draft boards. This time the local boards have
been told that they no longer need defer graduate stu-
dents (except those who will be pursuing medical or
divinity studies) nor the men who would have had
occupational deferments. No (one is calling the Septu-
agenarian a fool now as they did several months ago,
mainly because this directive was not his idea; it was
the President's and the National Security Council's.

This action on the part of the National security Coun-
cil (of which the President is a member), if combined
with the recent trend of the war in Vietnam, leads to
the logical end of calling up more men for duty in the
war torn land of Southeast Asia. if this assumption
proves true, then there are a lot of future dead war
heroes walking around this campus now.

Such a large increase, made possible by the new direc-
tive, would signify a condition of all out war. it would
be interesting to see if the American people would sup-
port a large war that would not be fought for such ideals
as, “making the world safe for Democracy" or the pres-
ervation of our heritage. The war’s justifications could
only be the "need" that the balance of power in Asia
must be maintained and that our national prestige upheld.
Is our prestige, let alone the Asian power balance,
worth the extra blood of escalation? It was not enough
of a reason for the French to continue fighting in 1954.

The call up of men by the National Security Council
should be used as a lever in peace negotiations rather
than as an attempt to escalate the war. This tactic should
have been used Christmas '66 when, according to Har-
rison Salisbury (who spoke at the University last March),
the North Vietnamese were trying toarrange peace talks.
it is too late now, when conditions in South Vietnam are
so bad that the Viet Cong are able to force the interna-
tional Voluntary Services to cut its field staff from 150
to 30 or 35 by greatly reducing the areas where the vol-

unteersvcan safely operate.

Although the graduate schools will be suffering from
a loss of "able bodied men" as long as the war continues
the men will not have to worry; the government will

help pay them to continue their education; if they

Due to the demand of the
populars (popular demand) we
are presenting our second annual
awards for outstanding events in
various fields. We have labeled
them the Bus Riders Outstanding
Awards for all the standing out
in the cold they do.

The Time MagazineObjectivity
in News Reporting Award to the
ASP, for their effort to keep
opinion out of stories and cap-
tions.

The Billy Sol Estes‘il've Got
Nothing to Hide" Award to the
County of Albany which, after
three years of refusals, was
forced to admit they had over
35 million dollars worth of in-
surance with Mayor Corning's
firm.

The Times-Union decisiveness
Award to Central Council. At a
recent meeting on one vote there
were more sbstentions than yes
and no votes put together.

The Pope John Rhythm Method
Award to the inventors ofthsnsw
bus schedules, for their sense of
timing.

The Peggy Fleming Slippery
Skater Award to FSA for their
delicate msnuevsring of figures.

The Father ’l‘orquamads of the
Spanish lnquisition Award to Ed-
ward Durall Stone for designing
a wind whipped dustbowl between
the podium and the far-away park-
ing lot. (not to mention the far-
away parking lot itself)

The Brothers Political influ-
ence Award to the Americans for
Democratic Action.

The David Merrick Personality
Award to the City of Albany for
its weather.

The Elizabeth Taylor Back Off
When You Make 1 Mistake Award
to Lyndon B. Johnson.

The President Johnson's Cabi-
net Award toStudent Association,
one of the few organisations
whose rate of resignation can
match that of the Presidential
Cabinet.

The "Gad is Alive and Living

in ———— ——" Award to Slip-
pression.

Also to Central Council goes
the General Eisenhower Decision
Avoidance Award for sending
bills to committee and then pass-
ing them in almost the sameform
as when they went in.

There is a mental institution
in New England which is too
crowded to give individual analy-
sis to prospective inmates. in-
stead, they placs them in a large
empty room with a huge water
faucet turned on full and hand
each of them a mop. Anyone who
begins mopping the water is ad-
mitted while those who turn of!
the faucet are declared sanc.

in honor of this institution,
our highest award, the Golden
Mop, goes to the Bookstore Man-
agement for instituting new exit
procedures, armed guards, and
highly sophisticated techniques
to cut down the customer's thiev-
ery, while their employee rob
them blind out the back door.
A CONS'i‘llUC'i'lVESUGGHSTION
(for a change)

in the past, professors in tho
Business Administration pro-
gram have assigned such pro-
jects to their classes as invcsi-
ing money in stocks and bonds.
usually withtromendous success,

it seems that hardworking sin.
dents, with text books and pro-
fessors to guide them, are cap-
able of making sound business
decisions.

Perhaps FSA could create
several assistaniships in the
MBA (Master's) program for
part-time supervisory work in
the hookstoro. These students
could run the bookstore as a
class project, plotting flow charts
for moving goods, ordering, limo
schedules for employee, and
plans for reduced pilferage.

Not only would these students
gain practical experience not
obtainable in the classroom, but
they might also introduce some
new ideas into the bookstore.

“It’s All Greek To me...  ‘5

by Maggie Diet:

Off Center

Greek Week 1968 is already
over and plans for 1969's Week
are already under way. Many
thanks are due Cluirmen Linda
Klein and George Lisbowitz and
their Committee Chairmen. Both
Linda and George comment that
they are pleased with the events
of'the Week and especially luppy
with the success of Greek Foi-
lies which received overwhelm-
ing support.

This year's Greek Week was
greatly improved and supported I
after last year's beginning. The
Chairmen hope to make Greek

‘Week 1969 an even greater suc-

cess. Each event merits consid-
oration.

The lSC-lFC Coker-Smoker
was an evident success. The
Ballroom was filled to capacity
for the Coker; the event was
well planned. (Well, guys, what
can i say? Reports have it that
the Smoker was a good night
tool)

Greek Follies, the high-point
of the Week, received All-Uni-
versity support. Thanks to all
concerned for their contribu-
tions.

Tuesday and Wednesday All-
Univeristy Open Houses were
held by all fraternities and so-
rorities. i would like to see this
hospitality further extended. Per-
haps All-University All-Greek
Open Houses could be held at
the beginning of the fall se-
mester too.

The Panel Discussion - Recep-
tion held Thursday with Union
and R.P.I. was an informative
exchange of ideas. Faculty par-
ticipation, however, was lacking.
it is hoped that faculty members
will contribute next year.

Friday's Concert with the
"Blues Magoos" presented the
most problems, especially in
planning and financing. in my
humble, thirsty opinion, it is a

mistake that Schaefer Beer is
not served on this campus.
Schsefsr is opening another plant
in our fair city. The Company
was seriously considering spon-
soring a "big name” Concert
for this Week. However, since
the institution with the propor-
tionally highest percentage of
imbibers is not using their pro-
duct, who can blame them?

The Concert Chairmen were
put off and understandably put
out in their semester-long re-
quest for another sponsor, F-
S-A. No one was able to contact
a group for a Concert scheduled
months in advance, until theCon-
cart was at hand. Thank you to
Student Association for its con-
sideration.

Olympic Day, with outdoor
sports competition, Was con-
cluded with the fraternity tug of
war during half-time of the Siena
game. Girls are supposed to have
more body fat . . .

The Beer Party is proof that
Greeks can sponsor a social
event without traumatic or criti-
cized after-effects. Hangovers
are to be contemplated in soil-
tude.

in any event, this year’sChair-
men are to be congratulated. Ap-
plications for 1969 Greek Week
Chairmen and Committee Chair-
men will be available Monday,
March 1 at fraternity and so-
rority meetings.

The Chairmanships available
are: Greek Week Chairmen (2),
Greek Folles Chairman (2),
Chairman of All-University Open
Houses (1), Guest SpeakerChair-
man (i), Speaker's Reception
Chairman (1), Beer Party Chair-
man (l), Publicity Chairman (2),
an Solicitations Chairmen (2).

Chairmen will be elected by
Pan-Hellenic Council and the two
Chairmen of Greek Week 1969.

The foremost enemy of Com-
munism and Fascism has al-
ways been the academic com-
munity. Academe has tradition-
ally been the vonguard of liber-
ty, for it realizes that there can
be no intellectual freedom lnan
atmosphere of fear. Therefore
it is understandable that Hitler,
Stalin, and Mussolini felt com-
pelled to seek the subjugation
of the campus-based community.

Americans have felt fairly se-
cure in this area. in recent years
attacks upon the intellectual com-
munity have been few and they
have not succeeded. But today
as in the early fifties the bes-
con celledacademe is challenged.

in our own area an Assembly-
man from Troy, NeilKelleher,is
the latest in a long chain of poll-
ticians to take on the university
community. He stridently de-
mands that the State University
of New York deny the use of of-
fices in public institutions (i.e.
SUNYA) to those professors en-
gaged in draft counseling. in
other words, the honorable Mr.
Kelleher demands the dismis-

sal of these most courageous
members of our faculty.
Neil W. Kelloh'er is no flit;

lar. infect there are times when .

his anti-Communist ombennce
can be downright amusing. Last
Thursday night on the Eleventh
Hour News, after hearing a
cogent and rational argument
by a young pacifist as to why
he could not serve in Vietnam,
Kelleher said: if you don’t like
the system -— i don't want to
use the word system, it's a
Communist word — then get out!
And he was serious.

This Joe McCarthy from Troy
has yet to learn that I manhss
the right to free speech oven on
state owned property. This is
the kind of man who dares ciui-
lenge the most resolute and finest
members of our community.

i can only warn the rest of
the faculty not to take too much
comfort from their present so-
curity. Unless we drive the Neil
Kellehers from positions of in-
fluence in our society, every-
ones' freedom is threatened. If

Opposing the draft is not an
evil, and i don't condemn advo-
cates of selective service aboli-
tion. However, I deplore the fact
that state employees can openly
and illegally advertise that they
can tell you how to beatthe draft.

First of all, the money used
to feed SUNYA's faculty mem.
bers' families, or whatever, is
supplied by the state. This cash
comes from the people and is
supposedly used in the best in-
terest of these peeple. At pres-
ent, some members of the facul-
ty seem to have taken it upon
themselves to define what is
best for the citizens ostw York.

Besides lack of Justice, a vir-
tue which i have never accused
liberals of possessing, those fac-
ulty members also seem to be
lax in the conscience department.
if they feel so strongly on these
issues, which is their right, let
them resign and accept their
paychecks from someone other
than those whom they are oppos-
ing, They appear not to mindihat
the "enemy" is paying them.

Related to this situation is
whether or not we should have
an "open" campus. By "open,"
liberals mean free to do any-
thing. Aside from hot g ungrate-
ful to the citizens o the state,
these people are also inconsider-
ate. As hippies walk around, con.
taminating the campus, they are
being subsidized by taxpayers.

These taxpayers are also the
people who vote representatives
into office, and the representa-
tives express the will of their
constituents by passing laws. So
what do the students do? They

advocate the breaking of laws
. . . civil disobedience. The poor
things are so oppressed and
impoverished. While back home
in their pigpens, they save so
they can purchase some grass or
LSD. i don’t want to say that Al-
bany State should become a gar-
rison state. What lpropose is a
publicly apolitical faculty and a
campus law against subversive
political groups, but not on every
campus. i don't care where de-
generates protest, so long as it's
not state-owned.

Speaking of politically subver-
sive groups, we've got some
wing-adings on campus. SDS lost
the title of farthest left to the
Faculty-Student Committee to
End the War in Vietnam. The
committee recently set upatrash
table in the Campus Center,
where they sell books. No, they
don't give them away; they’re
still capitalists at heart. The
table features items for those
who are attracted to the table:
left-wing propaganda for the lib-
erals, and insect repellent for
the bugs. The Committee chang-
ed its name from Student-Fac-
ulty Committee to End the War in
Vietnam when the faculty member
wanted top billing over the stu-
dent. The Conunitteo sponsored
talks about the presidential can-
didates in '68. The closest thing
to a right-winger talked about
was Eugene McCarthy. 1 under-
stand that YAF is offering a
one-way ticket to lied China to
some lucky commie with aguar-
antee by the fortunate winnerthat
he won't return to the U,8, I
feel members of the Committee
ought to take up the offer and
fight for hero ilo in Vietnam.

The garbage crisis in New
York City, far from being a
mere difference of opinion be-
tween Gov. Rockefeller and May-
or Lindsay, created significant
political and social repercus-
sions.

Before evaluating Mr. Rocke-
feller's actions, it is first neces-
sary to understand certain facts.
First that the strike of the sani-
tation workers was illegal. The
Taylor Law prohibits strikes by
public employees such as police-
men, firemen and sanitation
workers. Secondly the strike pro-
duced a clash between two po-
litically ambitious men, both of
whom are constantly aware of and
concerned about their public im-
ages. Finally, the solution of the
problem, as far as Lindsay and
Rockefeller are concerned, en-
tails either alienating orpleasing
the large voting bloc represent-
ed by labor. Thus political exped-
iency, as well as public welfare
plays a part in the garbage strike.

Gov. Rockefeller’s decision to
deal with the union, contrary to
the wishes of the mayor produc-
ed severai complications. His
capitulation to union demands all
but invalidated the Taylor Law.
it is indeed difficult to enforce
a status when any citizen, espec-
tally the governor, gives coun-
tenance to those who break it.
Obviously, Rockefeller has set
a dangerous precedent.

Soon after the strike started
in New York City, a similar
sanitation workers walkout be.
gan in Memphis, Tennessee; (1
city which also bans strikes by
public employed. A connection
between this strike and the way
the New York City walkout was
handled is of coursc,purely spec-
ulative; but the possibility cannot
be discounted.

Mr. Rockefeller not only ap-
peased the illegal demands of
the union, but his conduct con.
earning the union boss is ques-
tionable. During the crisis John
J. DeLury, the president of the
striking union was jailed for lg-
noring a court order which pro-
hibited the strike in accordance
with the Taylor Law.Dsi.ury was
later released from jail by Rocks-
feller to "take part in the nego-
tiations." Strangely enough, De-

Lury had been Rocky's most avid
supporter in the 1966 campaign.

in the last extremity, rather
than give in to the strike, the Na-
tional Guard should have been
used to clean the streets. on-
viously, this would not be a per-
manent solution, but it might
make the santi-men think twice
about their strike. Although the
city would be in an unsettled
state, it would be preferable to
giving in to what State Supreme
Court Justice Saul S. Striet call-
ed "not really a strike" buti'ex-
tortion.” As Mayor Lindsay said,
"Now is the time, and here isthe
place, for the city to determine
what it is made of; whether it
will bow to unlawful force or
whether it will resist with all the
strength and courage that 8 mil-
lion people can find."

Labor unions have an unques-
tionable place in our mechaniz-
ed society. However, they can
function only as long as they
remain within the realm of law
and order. When a labor union
or any group breaks the law they
must be punished rather than re-
warded. Through his actions Gov.
Reckefeller has indeed wan the
support of labor, but he has done
so at the expense of the law.Now
that his image has been tarnish-
ed, maybe the name of Rocks-
feller will come up less often
when people consider the presi-
dential election of 1068.

a man comet say whatever no
wants to in his classroom with.
out fear of retribution, than the
victory of the new Fascism is
complete. ' .

Those faculty members who
are today clullsngedbytheu sec-
ond rate politicians deserve the
support of every one‘ of us. The
question is not whether you sup-
port the wsr in Viotmm; thtl
question is whether yon accep.
the principle coiled academic
freedom. if the issue is patriot-
ism, then who. are the patriots;

Nell Kelleher who is still fight—
ing the Bill of Rights, or the
Faculty Committee members who
stand strongly against the debili-
tating war and for the young
Americans who are so threaten-
ed by the murder lottery called
the draft.

The patriots are those facul-
ty members whose belief in the
ideals of America means much
more to them than the twisted
Americanism of Lyndon B. John-
son. And the patriots in the
legislature are the men like As-
semblyman Joseph Kottler of
Brooklyn, who says that he is
proud of the SUNY system and
that the Legislature should keep
its fingers out of it.

Kottler realizes that disagree-
ment with our Vietnam policy is
not "equal to treason." That is
a lesson that the upstate Neander-
thals like Kslleher have yet to
learn.

Let us answer Neil Kelleher.
This is not Nazi Germany and
there are still those of us who
will fight for the intangibles
America represents; not for the
convulted provinces of our Pres-
ident’s mind but for the ideal
called freedom. We will not be
intimidated by the likes of Neil
Kellsher. Let us, all of us, stand
up and say that we are firmly
behind those on our faculty who,
in this hour of democracy's per-
il, came forth in defense of the
tenets of America.

Our patriots are not the right-
wingers who, in their twisted de-
votion to their country, would
trample upon all she represents.
No, the draft counselors on our
own campus come much closer
to the true patriotism.

After all who do we consider
the heroes of The Third Reich;
the Nazis who were only too glad
to support their government in
a policy of mass murder and in-
evitable defeat or the dissent-
ers who opposed the Nazi re-
gime and its policy. it is the lat-
ter that we refer to as the "Good
Germans" and l gladly stake
my destiny with their counter-
parts in Lyndon Johnson's
America.
