Complaint

To the Editor:

1 am writing to protest what
1 consider to be abuses on the
part of the management of the
University Bookstore, in their
administration of what is effec-
tively a very comfortable mono-
poly on our campus. 1 donot wish
to become involved in the con-
troversy over their apparent pre-
occupation with deodorants and
beer mugs in preference tobooks.
i shall confine my complaints
to five.

First of all, in view of the
enormous volume of business the
Bookstore does, (evidenced by the
preposteroust long lines that
their incredible system of text
book distribution produces) lfind
it difficult to believe that stu-
dents should have to pay list price
for texts, without any discount
whatsoever.

Secondly, i fall to understand
how the management can be so
presumptuous as to ask the stu-
dents to order books without
knowing the prices. Why are the
prices not listed along with the
titles and authors of the books?

My third complaint has been
mentioned, in passing, above. If
the Bookstore were really in
competition for patronage, i am
sure that they could find a better
system that which produced the
hours, literally hours, of waiting
in line to order books (some of
which we were then‘told were"not
in.")

My fourth and fifth complaints
are the result of a rather wide-
spread sttitude on the part of
many on this campus. The attitude
is directed at the student body,
and is captured in the statement,
"That’s all right, they're only
students." The management of
the Bookstore has decided that a
student who has purchased shook
may not return thebook unless he
can produce evidence from the
Registrar that he has dropped the
course. I would very much like
the Bookstore management to
show me a bookstore "on the out-
side" to which one cannot return
undamaged merchandise, within a
certain period of time, with only
a reasonable justification and
without any notes from the
Registrar.

As the policy stands now, even
when presented with the required
documentation, the Bookstore
will make no exchanges or re-
turns until after 12 February. It
is almost unbelievable that such
an arbitrary policy is tolerated.
Having fulfilled thepresumptuous
requirement of “proof” from the
Registrar, one is further imposed
upon by being made to await the
convenience of the Bookstore.

it appears that the management
of the Bookstore, instead ofpass-
ing on thebenefits ofits monopoly
to the students, is abusing its
privileges. is there no control
over these people and what
amounts to their unabashed ex-
ploitation of the students?

James L. Fallon

Rebuttal

To the Editor:

We thank Miss Calio for her
obvious concern about the liter-
ary standards oft'The Word. " but
much of her apparent confusion
could have been avoided. it is
always a good idea, when review-
ing literature, to pay close at-
tention to the written word —
that is what ultimately counts,
not the reviewer's precon-
ceptions or ideas derived from
brief glances at complex works.

As editors, we have read and
reread the material in "The
Word" dozens of times, and
therefore are more familiar with
content and theme than a critic
who has read it once or twice.
With this in mind, we feel justified
in criticizing our critic’s ap-
proach.

Miss Calla is quite right. There
is a definite lack of concern for
the literary publications at this
University. The quality exists,
but some students never quite
get around to submitting their

works. She makes a serious
mistake. however. when 911°
claims that we have cut down on
variety because variety doesn‘t
exist. On the contrary. We con-
sidered printing other poem!»
short stories, essays, and even
another play, but to include them
all in one issue would skyrocket
publication 'costs and wreck our
budget. Due to the erratic collec-
tion and distribution of student
tax money (which supports "The
Word, " among other things) we
are forced to limit the numbers
ofvpages per issue. As editors,
we chose to print that which we
felt best reflected the aim and
tone of our magazine. As a matter
of fact, we expanded this issue
(and deveststed our budget) in
order to include the play
“Robert's Civil War."

Since the works are available
to the readers, it is not afunc-
tion of a reviewer to paraphrase
an article, that is unnnecessary
verbiage. By definition,acrltic‘s
function is to come forth with
intelligent criticism. The ASP
literary critic seems to have
overlooked this concept. Although
some of the issue was devoted
to an exploration of war —re-
lated themes, it was outrageous
of Miss Calio to ascribe Viet-
nam sentiments to pieces which
are not concerned with the war.
in addition, the "war efforts”
deal with other human themes.

None ofour material was mono-
thematic. A closer reading by
Miss Calio might have prevented
some of her more sophmoric
comments. For instance, "Rob-
ert’s Civil War" deals withbasic
father-son hate conflict, man’s
existential condition, and erosion
of communication,aswell as war.
"Epithalamium" explicity de-
votes one line out of twenty-
one to war. We suggest you read
the poem to uncover it's real
concerns — we trust that our
readers are too sophisticated
to need our explanation.

We are not criticizing Miss
Calio's opinions, she is certain-
ly entitled to them. We doobject,
however, to her questionable
methods and her surprising lack
of factual information, all the
more serious as sheis an official
ASP spokesman.

Tax Solution

To the Editor:

in regard to your editorial in
the Febraury 18, l388 issue of
the ASP, entitled "A Bleak
Future," I believe the following
will be a plausible solution to
the deteriorating finances of the
Student Association. As it now
stands, the student tax is an
optional fee to any studentuttend-
ing the University.

This leaves the receipt ofsuch
tux monies vulnerable to the
whims of the students who feel
they will not receive $48 worthof
enjoyment from the various Stu:
dent Association sponsored
activities or those students who
"just don't have the money."

At Hudson Valley Community
College from where l trans-
ferred to State, there is a manda-
tory student activities fee paid
by every student at the begin-
ning of the school year.

This, as you can plainly see,
assures a definite amount of
money for each student enrolled
and makes it much easier to set
up a budget without having to
wait to find out from the burner
how many students paid student
tax and how many did not.

Of course, the argument will
arise, “l haven't any time to
.participate in activities, so why
should i pay for them?" The
fact is as you mentioned that there
are many things available to the
students whether they have or
have not paid student tax which
include lectures, concerts, the
Primer, and the ASP.

Certainly the present annual
fee of $46 is not based on the
expectation of 100 per cent of the
student body contributing, so if

every student were to pay the
student tax, it only stands to rea-
son the annsul fee could be
lowered while still providing
enough funds for Student Associa-
tion to operate.

With a lower student tax that
has to be paid, those students
not fully participating in campus
activities will not mind so much
spending the few extra dollars
that will be used .in bettering
the social aspects (1 campus life
for the student body of their
university. .

The fact that the student has
to pay this fee will give him
some incentive to get the most
cut of it that he can. More
participation means more activ-
ties and therefore feel that $48
is a little too much to pay to
read the ASP or the Primer or
play a couple of football games
in the intramural leagues.

Since 1 have not paid my stu-
dent tax i will admit the slight
feeling of guilt l have when I
pick up and read a copy of the
ASP for which someone else has
paid their motley.

Complaint

To the Editors:

Waterbury Hall Council would
like to register our strongest
protest over certain aspects of
bus service.

First of our concerns is the
extreme irregularity of bus serv-
ice on Sundays particularly be-
tween the hours of 5 and 9. As
many students use the buses at
these hours to go out for their
Sunday evening meal, we feel
that service at this time should
be more regular, and that the
hours at which buses run on Sun-
day evenings should be clarified
for the student body.

Secondly, we. feel that extra
buses should be put in service on
nights when exams are given in
courses in which the freshmen
are enrolled. On Nov. 30 and Dec.
6, when evening exams were
given by the Chemistry and Bio-
logy departments, large numbers
of Alumni Quad freshmen were
stranded on the new campus walt-
ing for the next bus because the
buses that were running would
not accommodate the number of
people who wanted to ride them.
We hope there will not be a
similar situation when the next
evening exams are given.

Finally, we would like a clar-
ification of the hours of bus serv-
ice on Friday and Saturday nights.
We would also liketoexpress our
concern over the curfewimposed
on residents of the new campus
dating Alumni Quad residents.
Although there is no official cur-
few, there is an effective one;
because there are no buses at
late hours on these nights, and
thus no transportation, these peo-
ple must return to their hallwith
the last bus run.

To the editors:

We believe the war in Vietnam
to be both immoral and illegal.
We also believe that there are
certain democratic processes
through which our beliefs may
be made evident that have not
yet been adequately realized by
those sympathetic with us.

What we are specifically re-
ferlng to is the act of writing to
one's congressman or to the
President in objection to pres-
ent United States policy and future
objectives in Vietnam.

This course of action was sug-
gested by David Schoenbrun,
former director of the Washing-
ton News Bureau for CBS, and
presently the only professor of
Vietnamese history in the United
States, in an address to Univer-
sity students on Sunday, Feb. ll.

lleve this to be a legal, demo-
cratic method of having one's

COMMENT

by William M. Leue

 

 

A week ago today the Johnson
administration announded thatall
student deferments for beginning
and first-year graduate students
not in medical or dental schools
will end as of June, 1968. in
addition, many occupational de-
ferments will be eliminated.

It was predictable, to say the
least, that this move would be
greeted by cries of anguish from
students and denunciations from
college administrators. it is true
that the termination of graduate
deferments will be a severe blow
to many schools, especially those
who rely on grad assistants to
carry much of their under-
graduate teaching load.

Since i am a graduatingSenior,
the new announcement affects my
future drasticallyandimmediate-
1y. i decided some years ago that
i will go to jail rather than serve
in Vietnam, but to suddently see
the shadow of iron bars begin-
ning to solidify into reality is
disquieting after spending four
years of college preparing for a
professional career. Those stu-
dents whose backgrounds do not
impell them to object to military
service on moral grounds must
still confront the liklihood that
they will have to make sudden
changes in their plans for the
future.

in fact, we are all in for a
large dose of cold reality. We
are about to be underemoniously
dumped out of our nice, safe,
middle-class sanctuary of “ed-
ucation” and confronted with the
kind of coercion that we have
allowed the balck and the poor
to undergo for years. We are
like the middle-class negro
family who has lived on the edge
of the ghetto, completely insensi-
tive to the plight of its neigh-

Solution To War

To the Editor:

The war situation as it exists
today shows that prayers, demon-
strations and vigils do not and
war.

Wars have economic causes
and it is the economic causes
that must be removed.

The present system of society,
capitalism, which is based on
private property and classes, and
that produces the cause of war
must be ended and be replaced,
as the Socialist Labor Party
teaches, by the Socialist society
that gives everyone a stake in
peace.

The great need of the hour
is for the acceptance ofSocinllsm
as the solution to war and the
other evils of capitalism.

Labor Party.

bors, and who wakes up one night
to find its house in flames.

We must now face the enor-
mity of what our country is doing
in Vietnam and around the world,
not as detatched onlookers, but
as either active participants in
murder or as political prisoners
of our own murderous society.
it is not an intellectual decision
that must be made, but a gut
decision, a real decision.

The administrators of the coun-
try’s graduate schools are cor~
rect when they say that the ending
of graduate deferments will cause
a shocking waste of trained man-
power. But they must admit that
this waste is only a directlogical
consequence of the even more
shocking waste and criminal in-
humanity of the Vietnam war.The
ending of the academic sanctuary
for the conomically privileged
(you and me, that is), will be
constructive if it forces us into
active opposition tothe war which
we have tactly supported by ac-
cepting our 2-S deferments and
letting our government (yours and
mine, whether we like it or not)
send somebody else to die in the
jungles of Southeast Asia in the
vain cause of ramming our
Western so-called culture down
the throats of a tiny peasant
country.

in fact, it would be better if all
student deferments were elimin-
ated. This move might tip the
wobbly political balance that is
maintaining the administration
in its present course. The Presi-
dent knows this, of course, and
so the undergraduates among us
will be "safe" — for a while.

publishers." This decline means
that fewer divergent ideas are
offered to the public through
newspapers. For example, New
York City, which at one time
had sixteen English-speaking
dailies, now has only three.Even
this is an exception because, out
of the nations fifty largest cities,
only twenty-three have more than
one-newspaper ownership.

This lack of ideas isimportant
because it leads to over-
simplification. The recent race
riots reveal the want of origin-
ality and diversity in solving
social problems. Most of the
papers in Newark, Detroit, and
elsewhere came to the same
conclusion about the nature of
the riots: They were caused by
a small group of left-wingers,
pushed on by "subversives."
Later investigation showed for
deeper motivations than these,
but the mass-circulation,mono-
poly-owned papers were oblivious
to other ideas at the time.

The Vietnam War coverage
also shows much mediocrity and
one-sldedness. Aside from the
better papers of the industry
(New York Times, Christian
Science Monitor, etc.), there has
been little original interpretation
of events. Despite the widening
Credibility Gap of the Johnson
Administration, most papers use
the government line. Good
examples are the two Albany
papers, both owned by the same
publishers. The general slant of
the Albany Times Union and the
Knickerbocker News is the same:
the United States is right, and is
winning the war. Although recent
events disprove these assump-
tions, the reader rarely receives
another picture.

it is time we look at the slow
erosion of the free press.The
giant publishing concerns are
slowly monopolizing the informa-
tion field. These consolidations
have the power to advance or
thwart the progress of society.
They can play up or down the
news and its significance, foster
and feed emotions, create com-
placent fictions, and uphold empty
slogans. It is important that they
do not crush free thought, be-
cause deceitful men thrive on an
unquestioning public. As Napo-
leon Bonaparte once remarked,
“Three hostile newspapers are
more to be fearedthan athousand
bayonets."

Building Better Bridge

by Harry Nuelrols

 

Today's hand illustrates one
of the most lmportantprinciple's
for playing a. hand—let the op-
ponent’s bidding work for you.
The hand was played in a sec-
tional team-of-four match. The
bidding is given as it took place,
and even though this writer was
involved, I don't approve. But
then if it has not occurred, there
would be no story.

North’s no trump was of the
weak variety, 12-14 points. South’s
cue bid was meant as Staymen,
asking North to bid a four-card
major if he had one. The slam
was reached by pure momentum.

When the dummy came down,
South could see that the basic
problem was entries to the North
hand. Three were desirable. One
to finesse trumps, and two more
for successive finesses in
spades; but only two, the top
clubs, were available.

There was a chance that the
ten of hearts would turn into
a third entry, and since draw-
ing trumps was the first order
of business, South ruffed the
diamond opening in his hand and
played a club to dummy's ace.

The heart jack was run through
East's king, and when it held,
the first hurdle had been clear-
ed. Now, if East had started
with just two hearts, the extra
entry would materialize. So a
low heart was led from dummy.

East followed low. Well, you
cannot have everything. South's
queen won the trick and the last
trump was drawn with the ace.

Now South paused to collect
his information. East bad start-
ed with three hearts and most
likely, for his overcall, six (or

more) diamonds. To getafurther
count on the hand, South cashed
the club queen; East following.
That gave East at least two
clubs, and, therefore, probably
two spades maximum. if one of
those spades were an honor,
only one spade finesse would be
needed.

So South entered dummy with
the remaining high club and led
the spade ten. East and South
played low, and West's queen won
the trick. The diamond return
was ruffed and South's ace of
spades brought down East's now
long king, and the slam was
home.

Notice that it does East no
good to cover the spade ten, for
than South wins and concedes a
trick to the queen, claiming the
balance.
