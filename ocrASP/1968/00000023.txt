The Blues Magoo: appeared in concert (please pardon the

expression) last Friday evening at the Washington Armory.

 

by Gail Soiian

A Big Prints Show—compiled
by a Big Univeristy—with many
Big Names involved; and it is
ours. The first exhibit orginat-
ing from our school has opened
in the Art Gallery of the Fine
Arts Building. Compiled by
Donald Mochon, Director of the
Gallery, Thom O’Connor, Asso-
ciate Professor of Art, and Mrs.
Charles Liddle, Associate Di-
rector of the Gallery, the invite-
tional exhibition is comprised of
94 prints by 4’1 artists from all
over the United States.

The prints present a broad
range of style and subject matter,
from the gay colours of Carol

' There is no purpose in say-
ing anything more about Jake
Holmes, because I think that
Gary Gelt covered him quite
well in last Friday's ASP. How-
ever, I do believe that the fine
musicians who backed him up
deserve some praise.lfanything,
they made Holmes. Their pro-
fessional showed through as they
were able to pick up and re-
spond musically to Holmes’
lyrics and mannerisms.

Anyone who remained Thurs-
day night, Feb. l5, can attest to
their improvisational abilities,
when the group, minus Holmes,
sat around and jammed.

Ted, the guitar player, has to
be one of the "best" around. I
an firmly convinced he can do
anything from cool jazz to pay-
chedelia with his guitar.

The group has been together
for two months, which certainly
says something for their musi-
cal abilities. They are going
to cut a record in about six
weeks and if it just showcases
thenir live performances, it will
so .

The Coffee House Circuit be-
gan with an auspicious perfor-
mance, and I hope it continues
in presenting such a high cali-v
bre of talent. .

Although Jake, Holmes can be

ngrahllated, some atthe luna-

:ty deserved to belashed. Never
have I seen such ill-manneredinv
dividuala. During any perfor-
mance, the roar from outside
Lho “cage” made it difficult, if
not impossible, to hear Holmes.
One would like to think that
people would at least have the
common courtesy to be quiet
so that those who did come to
hear the performance could en-
joy it. it is also a pity because
these people not only spoiled
the show for others, but man-
aged to miss something good
themselves.

concert last week—wasn't it a
gas? As promised their per-
formance was electrifying. This
time the audience deserves the
credit for being so polite.

I saw the first half of the
concert and about the only re-
action I got was a persistent
ringing in my ears. They put
up a wall of noise but little
definition as far as individual
instruments or sounds were
concerned.

Congratulations are in order
to WPTR and specificially their
Wilde Childe for proving that
both disc jockeys and pop music
can be intelligent. The above
name DJ is the first in the
area to come up with a “non-
commercial” rock show which
ignores the "teeny bopper” and
his Top Ten. The program runs
from 10 to 1 p.m., Monday
through Friday. Give a listen

you have some free time;
I think you will be pleasantly
rewarded.

“Eye” Presents

Drama Readings

Tonight “The Golden
Eye" will present two plays,
Edward Albee’s "The Ameri-
can Dream," and Archibald Mac-
Leish's. "The Fall of the City"
The production will beain at lo
p.m.

The production is being stag-
ed by Robert B. Cutty, who de-
scribed this performance as
"a staged reading.‘ The Albee

comedy was written, in 1959.

Cutty stated that the saw
tire “makes pointed comments
specifically on the several com-
ponents of the Protestant ethic:
commercialism, conformity, and
complacency regarding social
values, community ethics, and the
individual's personal morality."

The second play is a verse
drama for radio. Written in
1988, the short play concerned
with the powerful effects of fear
on the people of a democracy

afflicted with the numerous prob-
lems arising out of modern life.

The first cast includes Karen
Prete, Arnold Post, Judy Kirsch-
ner, Ellen Rogers, and Herb
Greenblatt. The plays are dou-

blecast; featured in the sec-
ond, with the above, are Greg
Kiersz, Janice Ayers, and
Steven Brockhouse.

tion. He was one of the first
printmakers to start working big
in the 1950's, and he went on to
develop a very definite and per-
sonalized techinque. “Fonts
Limon" appears tobe anabstract
landscape ofappealingly warm
and vibrant colours which wrap
around the rice paper and come
up a floating orange and pink
rainbow and amossy green moun-
tain with violet velvet paths about
it. A sweet and Winsome pink
heart, with all the splendour of
a mushy valentine, radiates its
warmth from the center. Mr.
Summers is an excellent print-
maker, and is able to control
the bleeding of the colours to
get just the soft, free edges
he desires. The composition
of his print is also quite well
planned, with paths of colour
drawing you from the edges to
the center. The curve of rain-
bow above also serves to con-
tain the eye within.

sister Mary Corita. the swing-
ing nun from die West Coast,
has three serigraphs inthe show,
one almost eleven feet long. It
is called "Power Upl” and pro-
claims itself thus in two-foot
high letters which pound out their
message in greens and blues and
yellows and pinks. A long Bible-
based paragraph follows along at
the bottom in glorious green to
add inspiration. Sister Mary
Cortia uses the silk-screen pro
cess ot its full advantage in her
choice of colours: “Jesus Never
Fails," another of her prints,
atrfully uses highlights of pink
and orange day-glow to accent
her letters and shapes.
print is very appealing in its
cheerful colours, and in the soft-
sell message she tries to get
across. A Lennon-McCartney
quote, “i get by with a little
help from my friends," sits on
top, and a chopped-up message
of “it’s not easy" slides around
to the right. Sister Mary's care-
free calligraphy is casual, but
well done, and effectively points
up the informal “fun” approach
to religion and life which she
seems to propound. She is Good-
ness with a grin.

Gerson Leiber's eerie intaglio

etching "The Crowd" is another'

recipient of a purchase prize;
it is especially excellent from a
technical standpoint, having deep,
dense blacks and sharp, clear

whites. There is no real com
position, but instead an over-
all mass of faces looking up at
something. The whole idea of
crowds brings with it thoughts
of fear and uncontrollability: the
amoeba-like form at Times
Square on New Year's Eve, a
trampling stampede at a cry of
“Firei”, the thrill-seeking
audience of a man on a ledge.
And Leiber’s crowd, looking up,
have a full range of emotions
on their faces— a flicker of
amusement here, the light of
fear or panic there, and patient
expectation on still another face.
They stare upwards—at what we
do not know—and as we watch,
them, the blackness begins to
close in on us, and the anxiety
which flickers about the white
shining faces is communicated
to us, and we are drawn in.

Very hip, au courant elements
can be found in Ben Sakoguchi's
large etching, cryptically en-
titled "Critic's Choice or
Maybe Lament; Who CaresSweet
Nancy: Signed. Mad Magazine
Bosch." This print is filled with
minute details, cartoons, and a
variety of elements the meanings
of which are for the most part
rather evasive. A large patch of
design on one side is underscored
with a quote from the Jefferson
Airplane record "White Rabbit;"
it says "one pill makesyou larger
and one pill makes you smali,and
the one that mother gives you
don't do anything at all. . .Ask
Alice when she's ten feet tall.”
With one hang up—you have to
look in a mirror to read it.

Perhaps this indicates the title
of Alice's book, “Through The
Looking Glass,” which lends of
a rotation of fantasy to the in-
terpretation of the blue etching.

Then, the first thing we are
confronted with are tiny soldiers,
dressing and hopping into toy
jeeps and tanks, and a group
of naked, laughing little people
seated in a circle around a blank
sign.

Then there is a wall and on the
other side are hundreds of Nazi
soldiers, who, wearing masks,
look like they just stepped off
a surrealistic 15th C. Hieronymus
Bosch canvas (cf the title).

    

Friday-,February 23, 1968

Moving towards the bottom
there are a silhouette.of Mary
Poppins, a cartoon tiger, agroup
of Nazi soldiers carrying a dead
cardinal or pope, a picture of a
paraplegic schoolteacher in a
wheel chair, and Joseph Stalin
carrying his daughters in his
arms.

The whole thing is rather
annoying, for even after you are
able to decipher some of the ele-
ments and symbols, the overall
meaning (if there is one)remains
distinctly indistinct. The whole
thing seems a rather glorious,
horrible game of wits and
doodles; maybe Sakoguchl is
showing us a reflection of our
ridiculous world, of ourselves,
and if it seems unpleasnat, per-
haps the distortions are only
too painfully true.

The birds Patricia. Benson
chooses for her engravings are
powerful ones— "Predator" and
"Vulture"—and their delicately
etched feathers and strong heads
reveal all the fearsome might of
these creatures. Again, in Miss
Benson, we find a master print
maker in the traditional style.

Ted Davies’ colour wood cut
of the "Stock Market" is a
black, white, and gold portrayal
of the economic heart of the
World. The gold highlights play
a two-fold role in the print,
signifying both the market’s pre-
occupation with money and the
traditionalism of the institution

Just as modern painters seem

to be working on larger and
larger canvases, some print-
makers too, are exploring the
father bounds of their printing
presses. Big prints have agreat-
er, more immediate impact, but
they often lose a great deal of
the intimacy that used to be as—
sociated with etchings and en-
gravings.

What was a delicately carved
line has frequently become a
big slash, where there was a
small scene, there is now abig
red square and circle. This is
not to say all printmakers have
gone in that direction—even in
the larger prints an intensity
beyond the possibilities of small
prints have been achieved.

 

 

Reverie

by Walt Doherty .

 

 

“ ‘The time has come,’ the
Walrus said, ‘to speak of many
things, of shoes and ships and
sealing wax, of cabbages and
kings.’ " So, Chad and Jeremy
owe the title of their latest of-
fering with thanks (or apologies)
to Lewis Carroll.

The songs on the album are
different from the more usual
C 8: J tunes in that they involve
more "protest," social com-
ment, and satire.

Side two of the disc, “The
Progress Suite," is composed
of five movements: Prologue,
Decline, Editorial, Fall, and Epi~
logue. The basic idea of the
work is trite; it concerns the
fall of modern man’s civilization.
Its saving grace is the way
Jeremy Clyde has arranged the
melodies that he's written as
well as the melodies themselves.

"Decline" is almost baroque in
moods and tone; even the instru-
mentation approaches that per-
iod. Cleverly worked into the
piece are sounds of the stock
market, noise of crowds, and
other sounds of our hectic, rushed
life. “Fall” ends with an ato-
mic bomb explosion which says
just about all that can be said
about “Fall.” Throughout the
Suite you hear Clyde's melodies
which are tuneful, melodic, sing-
able—dt makes you regret that
they were put in this work in-
stead of some song that would
have a chance as a single. “Epi~
logue" contains the “moral” of
the “Progress Suite," but even

so it's got at good sound typi-
cally C at J.

"Rest in Peace" is a tune-
ful knock at the dying business
(and funeral customs). It’s about
a Memorial Maker named Mat-
thew. His customers bring the
names of those they held dear
and now are actually glad
to be rid of. The tone of
the song is kept up with the
melody which at times has a
distinct church sound.

“Family Way'I is about being
in the family way when one is
not supposed to be. It's done
tongue-in-cheek.

Other songs on the record are
done fairly \.‘11 also; in fact
the strength of the album lies
in its melodies and its arrange-
ments, because the subject mat-
ter, for the most part, is over-
used to a point where it is no
longer interesting (if the "Pro-
gress Suite" had come out about
10 years ago it would have been
the hotest thing to hit music
this decade; however, it is not
lo years ago). As i said above,
the strength is in the tunes them-
selves which are a major point
in favor of the album, and in
the instrumentation (at various
times you hear guitar, bongo,
harpsicord, organ, and sitar).

Profiles in tie Performing Arts

by John Webb

 

 

 

The University Revue is “coming,” and as
musical director, I feel that i should comment on
the production which is about to Imprcsmlfcdln the
theater which this company is setting up in the
Campus Center Ballroom. The elght-mcmbcr cast
has been hard at work since Christmas in order to
have the show ready for opening.

One’s first reaction would he that, with only eight
people in the cast and the simple sets with which we
are working, it is a simple production to stage.
Actually, just the opposite is the case. When so few
are involved, there can be no slips, and the char-
acters must blend and work very very closely to-
gether. When only a few Sets and simple props are
used, it isleft up tothe actors to create the illusion.

The music is very difficult, highly demanding,
but most enjoyable. It requires the girl to have a
good workable two-octave range, and it uses every
note. The Narrator and the boy must he versatile
singers in order to perform the music. The two
fathers have very clever songs, whilethe Mute says
nothing at all. Talk about extremes”

This year the Revue is fortunate to have such a
talented group of people working for its success.
Our-programs do not contain, as does the "Play-
bill” in New York, a “Who's Whoin the Cast," so
perhaps this can be considered the purpose of this
column.

Leading the cast as El Gallo and the Narator is
Charles Bartlett who will long be remembered for
his role as Paul the puppeteerinlastyear's Revue,
"Carnival," and for his role as Lennie in Of Mice
and Men. Chuck is a Senior who hails from San
Antonio, and who came to State after a stint in the
Coast Guard. in addition, Chuck has appeared in
other major productions — “Lysistrata.” “Wap-
shot Scandal," "The Memorandum," “’l‘he Mis-
anthrope," and "Private Life."

Luisa, the girl, is Mary Carney, a talentcdfresh-
man drama major who comes from llion. New York.
indeed this Mohawk Valley town which gives birth
to people who speak with flat A’s has caused quite a
problem. Before coming to State, Mary appeared in
her home town in "Bye, Bye Birdie," and bad the
lead in “Carousel.”

Playing opposite Mary as Matt, the boy, is Gary
Restifo, a sophomore from Mount Pleasant High
School in Schenectady. This is Gary's stage debut,
but he is very active on campus as Vice Chairman
of Community Programming Commission, the new
Freshman Orientation Program, and as a brother
of Sigma Tau Beta.

“1- was assistant director of“L'il Abner," and di-
rector of’The Fantasticks'lln Pittsfleld, Mass. Play-
ing opposite him as the Girl’s father isJohn Webb.

Comic relief is very well provided for us by
Robert Clayton as Henry Albertson, the old actor
who recites upon cue, and Don Terry, thelndian
whose role for twenty years has been dying. Clay-
ton is a junior drama major from Waverly, New
York. He has appeared in such State productions
as "Carnival," "Lysistrata," and “Merton of the
Movies." This summer he played summer stock at
Cooperstown Playhouse. Terry is also ajunior who
transferred here from SUNY at Farmingdale. Pre-
viously. Don has appeared in “Auntie Mama," and
here at State has hadaroleinf‘The Memorandum,”
and the Golden Eye presentation of “MacBird.”

The complicated part of the Mute is played by
Ken Fisher. Ken is a junior Anthropology major
from Rochester. He was seen this year in“Sidc~
show," and last yearasaRoustabout ln"Carnival."
Ken's other production credits include "My Fair
Lady," “Our Town," and "West Side Story."

Accompanying the Show are three very accom-
plished musicians — Dennis Buck at the piano. Al
Santino on percussion, and Mrs. Marjorie Hartaell
at the harp; At, a junior from Lindenhurst, L.l.
was percussionist for "Sideshow," and has played
with numerous bands in his home area. Mrs. Hart-
zell holds first chair with the Albany Symphony.

Dennis is a well-known figure here In musical
shows, having played for "Gypsy," “Prevue '65,"
“Carousel ’66," "Carnival," and “Sideshow.” He
is also accompanist for statesmen. Duringthe sum-
mer he plays for the Brockport Summer Arts
Festival which has presented such shows as”Little
M'iry Sunshine,” "The Merry Widow," “Peter
Pan." “The Music Man,” and“Beils Are Ringing."

This production has been directed by Ellis Kauf-
man who is assisted by Jane Mandel. Ellis is a
Speech major from Philadelphia. His first theater
experience was his role in a summerstookproduc-
tion of Carousel at the age of fourteen. This past
fall he was co-dlrector of "Sideshow," and last
year he served as Production Coordinator of‘4Car-
nlval.” He has performed in "Gypsy," “Prevue
’65," "Carousel '66," "Lysistrata," and this last
summer he played summer stock at the Coopers-
town Playhouse for 24 hours.

Assisting with the production are Kathy O'Neil
as choreographer, Karen Nowlnski on costumes,
Phyllis Larsen — props, and Eileen Deming as
lighting designer. The show promises to be agreat
success.

 

Mary Carney as Luisa with Charles Bartlett, John Webb and
Edward Spence looking on.

in order to house the show. Seat-
ing Is limited to only 150 pqule
per performance and seven rows.
The small audience will help
visual and auditory perception.
An entire lighting system is also

prove viewing.

Ellis Kaulrnon Directs

Ellis Kaufman, producer of last
year’s production of "Carnival"
and co—director of"Sideshow," is
directing "The Fantasticks."

productions. He has also been
active in all phases of student
activities since his freshman
year.

Jane Mandel, secretary of
Dramatics Council, is the assis-
tant director. Miss Mandel has
appeared in many productions and
was last seen in the Brecht play,
“The Private Life of the Master
Race."

Kathleen O'Neil is the choreo-
grapher for “The Fantasticks."
She was responsible for tbedanc-
ing in both"Carnival" and"Side«
show."

Others involved in the produc-
tion are John Webb, musical di-
rector; J. Michael Walsh, produc-
tion coordinator; Karen Nowln-
ski, costumer; Phyllis Larsen
properties; and Mark Cunning-
ham, graphics.

Competent Cost

An extremely competent cast
portrays the eight characters in
the play. The lead roles of Matt
and Luisa are played by Gary
Restifo and Mary Carney. Miss

..

 

 

Page I3

Carney, a freshman from llion.
New York, gave a particularly
excellent performance in the
freshman skit "Damn It."
Charles Bartlett is the must;
or and the role of the mute is
filled by Kenneth Fisher. Edward
Spence portrays Hucklebee, John
Webb is Bellomy, RobertClayton
plays the old actor, and Donald
Terry is the man who dies.

Has Simple Story

The story of "The Fame;
sticks” is very simple and deals
with children and their fathers.
The children, Matt and Luisa, are
in love; however, their fathers
wish to have them go “out of
their minds with love." There-
fore, the fathers make elaborate
plans to no avail and the children
find out that love comes only
after experience. As the lyrics
to the hit song "Try To Re-
member" says: "without a hurt,
the heart is hollow."

The director of the show feels
that "The Fantastlcks" is dif-
ferent from the vast majority of
musicals produced today. “The
Fantastlcks" has absolutely no
scenery to speak of. The people
in it are realistic and at the
same stylized. The play is also
played very closely to the au-
dience, with the cast speaking to
the spectators at various points
in the show.

When the characters are not
"talking their case" to the au-
dience, they still keep the au-
dience especially in mind. Each
actor considers the audience as
a friend and gives a speech di-
rectly to the audience upon his
first entrance.

Should Be A Hit

An outstanding aspect of “The
Fantasticks" is its songs which
are a beautiful blend of lyrics
and music.“Try ToRemember,"
“Soon We Gonna Rain," and “I
Can See It" are among the many
hits.

The show has been running for
eight years in New York City
and has entertained scores of
people.
