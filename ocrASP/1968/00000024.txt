KB, KD Doininate Olympics
Weather Cuts Attendance

Kappa Beta fraternity andKap-
pa Delta sorority dominated
Greek Olympica Day last Sat-
urday, but it was Alpha Lamba
Chi, that was victorious on Mon-
day, as they defeated Upsilon Phi
Sigma in the finals of the tug-
o-war at half time of the Siena
basketball game.

The competition was preced-
ed by blizzard-like snow flur-
ries, but the participation was
quite good in the mens events,
although the spectator turn out
was less than had been expected.

Eight fraternities entered the

volley ball competition, whereKB
and APA advanced to the finals.
KB kept the same six man squad
throughout, and they were
extremely effective as they cap:
tured the championship by a 15-6
count.

In the sorority competition KD
gained the volley ball champion-
ship with a 15-10 win over Chi
Sigma Theta.

in the softball throw which was
a test of both strength and ac-
curacy the results were very
much the same.

Hoopsters Lose Two,
Record Overtime Win

by Iris Alson

Albany State Women’s Inter-
collegiate Basketball Team met
the women of Castleton inahome
game on Tues. Feb. 13. Unfor-
tunately for the womenofAlbany,
they were defeated for the first
time this season, the loss com-
ing from Castleton by the Score
of 37-30. The high scorer for
Albany State in this game was
Jean Herrick, who scored ten
points.

On Saturday, Feb. 17, Albany
State’s women participated in a
tournament at New Paltz. Com-
peting in the tournament were
Albany State, Duchess County
Community, and New Paltz.
There was no one tournament win-
ner, with each of the three schools
winning one game.

Albany suffered its second de-
feat cf the season by losing to
Duchess County Community by
the score of 24-2l but came back
to gain its third victory by de-
feating New Paltz 25-23 in over-
time. The score was tied 20-20
at the end of the regulation time.
Albany was able to win in over-
time by maintaining control of
the ball.

Both of the Saturday games
were team efforts. There was
good defense and the team play-
ed well as a whole. There were
two outstanding players for Al-
bany. They were guards, Jamie
Gearon and Gloria Mazure. Both

girls were defensively alert,
making several interceptions, as
well as controlling most of the
Jump balls. There was not a high
scorer for Albany.

Mermaid Win,
Drown Potsdam

Albany's women swim team,
under the direction ofMiss Meri-
deth Forrest, registered a 48-39
win over Potsdam, at Potsdam
last week.

A team of Renee Krinsky, Ann
Rohrbach, Ronnie Sharp and Bet-
ty Wepy captured the 200 yard
medley relay in 2:44.13, a school
record. Rohrbach also took first
in the 50 breaststroke witha time
of 41.5, another School record.

Another School record was es-
tablished by Sharp as she turned
in a 1:21 100 yard individual
medley. Rohrbach also estab-
lished a school record in the
100 yard breaststroke with a
time of i:32.1. The girls also
captured the 100 yard free style
relay with a team composed of
Wepy, 'Crinsky, Carol Frew and
and Barbara Hicks.

Second place finishers for Al-
bany included Frew in the 50
yard backstroke. Hicks in the
100 yard free, and in diving, and

In the men’s competition it
was KB again as Rich Patrol
had the best toss of the day.

Jack Sinnott of APA took sec-
ond, while KB's Dave Goldstein
was third. KD took the sorority
crown in this event and all the
others. Once again it was Chi
Sigma Theta in second, while
Kappa Chi Rho took third.

KD wins all

Once again it was KD that
topped the sororities, as they
defeated Chi Sig in this event
and in the snow shoe race to
score a clean sweep of the com-
petition, which was noi particu-
‘ rily well attended by sorori-
ties due to the weather and
scheduling of yearbook pictures
at the same time as the compo-
“lion.

in the tug-o-war five fraterni-
ties were entered. First APA
beat STB then UFS topped KB,
and ALC eliminated APA to set
the stage for Monday's finale
in the gym.

The men's snowshoe race was
canceled due to the lack of snow
and also because of prior com-
mitments such as yearbook pic-
tures and basketball games.

After the tug-o-war final troph-
ies were awarded by the Olympic
Day co-chairmen Duncan Nixon
and Laurie Post. First Place in

the men’s competition went toKB
and second place to APA. KD
topped the sororities, while Chi
Sig collected the second place
trophy. ALC was awarded a spe-
cial traphy for taking the tug-
o-war final.

APA HAS JUMPED INTO THE lead in League IS.

F rosh Top Siena 77-68,
Fall To Two Others

The freshmen have finally
given signs of coming of age, and
if the Hartwick game can be
brushed aside as atotal disaster,
the team can be looked on as
a rather solid one which still
makes some basic, needless mis-
takes.

At Fulton Montgomery, the
fresh were once again hit with
an horendous first half, shooting
only 23 per cent from the field.
They were also gettingbeatbadly
off the boards. This combined
with Fulton Montgomery's hot
shooting put the fresh 16 down
at the half. However. Just as
regularly as the fresh have had
terrible first halves shooting 51
per cent. Albany came back with
a good second half, to within five
points with three minutes left,
but couldn't quite pull it out. The
final score was 86-76 with five
men hitting double figures for
the frosh.

The Stone. game was an en
tirely different story. Albany led
all the way. The game was ex-
tremely sloppy, but through it

all the fresh ouihustled their old
rivals. Albany led by sevel at
the half, 41-34, and this is the
way the game stayed thenrest
of the way. For the second
straight game, the frosh had five
men in double figures, Jordan and
McDermott leading the team with
20 and 18 respectively.

The Hartwick game was the
kind the frosh would like to for-
get, but that would be impossible.
Albany was destroyed by Hart.-
wlck’s press, showed no muscle
under the boards, and played a
very ragged offense.

The first half wasn’t too bad
for Albany. The fresh had to
come back from a 17 point do-
ficit to make the halftime score
39-29. They still appeared tobe
very much in the game asthey
narrowed the gap to seven with
fourteen minutes remaining.

However, The fresh com-
pletely lost their cool against
Hartwick's full court zone press.
Hartwick hit an unbelievable 71
points in the second half to make
the final score 110-71.

Frosh Grapplers Win
Finish With 2-6 Slate

The freshmen wrestling team
ended their season this put Sat-
urday as they defeated Adiron-
dack Community College bya
score of 27-12. As a result of
this victory, the team finished
with a record of two wins and
six losses.

Pete Ranalli initiated the scor-
ing for Albany as he pinned his
opponent in 5:55. He was follow-
ed by Kev Sheehan who also Won
his match by placingtheshould-
ers of his opponent to the mats
in 5:43. Dave Jones, wrestling
at the l45-pound spot, decisioned
his opponent by a score of 4—1.
Roger Jones then recorded afor-
feit victory, thus allowing Albany
to amass eighteen points before
Adirondack could score.

The grapplers from Adiron-
dack finally registered points on
the scoreboard when, in the 152-
Dound division, Bruce Dellosia
outscored Ted Long of Albany in
a tight match by a score of 10-
9. The 100 - pound division was

forfeited by both teams as was
the 177 - pound spot. in the 167-
pound division, Gos of Adiron-
dack won the match by forfeit.

The match ended on a win-
ning note for Albany as Kris
Jackstadt pinned the Adiron-
dack wrestler in 3:27.

The record for the freshmen
this year is rather misleading
because of the fact that the team
was lacking enough wrestlers to
fill every position for their
matches. Each time that the team
participated in a match, they were
forfeiting three of the weight
classes, thus giving their oppon-
ents fifteen points before any
actual wrestling began. Con-
sequently the team was under
pressure from the first match on
to make up for these points.
Therefore, the members of the
team deserve great credit for
being able to surmount seeming-
ly impossible odds and record
victory where defeat seemed cer-
tain.

Standout Rich Margison

RIC MARGISON WASN’T STYMIED FOR long by the

  
   

Constantly Improving

From Cortland, New York
came a tall lanky freshman. He
went out for Coach Bill Schief-
felin's yearling basketball squad
and started to impress and he
has been performing brilliantly
ever since. The first year up
on the varsity, this sophomore
led the entire team in scoring.
This year he is setting the scor-
ing pace for the entire tri-city
area. However, Rich Margison’s
deserved rise to stardom is not
a totally unexpected one.

“Bambi,” as he is called by
onlookers because of his grace-
ful strides and amazing leaping
ability, came to Albany with cre-
entials to testify to his ability.
As a senior at Cortland High
School, Margison went on to gar-
ner the honor of heading the
All-Syracuse basketball squad.
When basketball season was not
occupying his time, Rich found
tennis and x-country worthwhile
sports as he lettered in both
at Cortland.

Like Father. Like Son

if his high school record was
not enough to give suspicions
that Albany was welcoming a
star, a look at Margison's family
tree could have provided a hint.
Bambi's father, Richard Sr.,was
a star center for the Albany
State basketball team when Page
Gym was the sports center of
Albany.

When asked what he attribut-
ed his marked improvement to,
Rich replied that, "A year's ex-
perience starting on the varsity
squad has helped me a lot. Doc-
tor Sauers' confidence in let-
ting me play my style of ball
has instilled confidence in my-
self."

Well-Rounded Person

Basketball takes up at least
three hours of Margison's day,
yet he has been able to main-
tain 11 C+ B— average as well
as positions on the Junior Class
Council and the inter-Fraternity
Council, where he is junior rep-
resentative of his fraternity,
Alpha Pi Alpha.

Lacrosse To Appear;
Practice Next Week

Lacrosse, a truly American
sport, will be appearing on cam-
pus for the first time this spring
For those who are unfamiliar
with the game ashort description
might be in order.

Lacrosse is a violent, action
packed sport that originated with
the American 1ndlans. The in-
dians played the game for fun
and entertainment, and also to
train their youngbraves. for war.
So when two tribes met on the la-
crosse field the result was often
closer to a war than a game,

Although the sport has been
tamed down a little bit by the
institution of some relatively
simple rules, and by the re-
quirement that the participants
wear some protective clothing,
lacrosse still remains a vio-
lent action packed sport that
is great for spectators, but not
for fainthearted participants.

The rules are easy enough.
Each team has 10 players, a
goalie, three close defenders,
three midfieldmen. three close
attacks. Each of these players
is equipped with a stick or
"cross," and the object. of the
game Is to get the small hard
rubber ball that is used into the
opponent's goal, but the bail may
not be touched by a player's
hand, so the crosses must he

used to propel It.

Due mainly to the efforts of
Steve Jakway, a Lacrosseclub
is presently beingorganized. The
club \which will take on a inter-
collegiate scheduie this spring,
will he coached by Joseph Sil-
vey of the Student Activities of-
fice with the assistance of John
Morgan of financial aids.

There are presently 25 men
out for Lacrosse, and plans are
being made to start practice ses-
sions next week at the new cam-
pus, weather permitting.

The team is still in need of
players, so all those interested
will be welcome. The club will
be holding an organization meet-
ing today at l p.m. in Humani-
ties 109.
