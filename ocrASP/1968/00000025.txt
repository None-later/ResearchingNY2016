The Albany cagers showed that they area team to
be reckoned with Monday as they survived a 10 minute
period of woeful shooting and miserable passing, and
still came on strong at the end to win by 7.

The Sauersmen played as well as would be expect-
ed for the first 20 minutes, and the indians from Lou-
donville definitely appeared to be outclassed in almost

.all aspects of the game. However, when the second
half got under way, it soon became apparent that the
Great Danes had suddenly gone sour. “is cold streaks
like this that make any team, college or professional,
vulnerable, for these streaks can strike any time on
any night. '

On Monday night a fired up Siena team quickly took
advantage of the Albany slump and the Indians came
storming back from a 15 point deficit to surge into a
five point lead. in a rivalry as heated as this one a rally
of such proportions could easily provide the spark nec-
essary to produce a major upset, and for a minute it
looked like that might be the case. However, the Albany
hoopsters suddenly settled down and went to work. The
gap was quickly closed as the Great Danes reasserted

their superiority, and once again took charge of the ‘

game. Rich Margison started to break through for driv-
ing lay-ups, and the defense clamped down, preventing
Siena from getting the good shots that they were working
for so methodically. So Albany shot back into the lead,
building a lead of nine and reinforcing the impression
given in the first half that Siena really is not on a par
with Albany.

With Siena out of the way the next big test for the
Great Danes will be a week from today at 1thaca. The
Sauersmen, with an 11 game win streak under their
belts, certainly deserve consideration for a tournament
,bid. A 17 game win streak is a possibility, and it is
hard to imagine how we could be overlooked if such a
win streak is achieved.

Buffalo State has already been assured of a tourna-
ment bid, due to their first place standing in the State
College conference, and it must be remembered that
Buffalo presently has five losses, with a possibility
of a couple more before the tournament. Albany pulled
out of this league several years ago, and has been play-
ing independently ever since, but we still take on a num-
ber of state schools, and if we beat Oswego, we will
have handled all opposition from that conference, thus
it would seem that if we do finish without another loss,
a tournament bid would be well deserved, but tourna-
ment officials are not known for their predictability,
so anything can happen.

NCAA Berth In Offing?

by Don Opp-d1 tone

The old saying that "there's a pot of gold at the end of every rainbow" may have
great significance for the Albany State University Basketball team and its ardent
supporters. Winners of their last 12 games and 15 of 18 overall, the Great Danes
are in serious contention, along with four other New York State teams, for three

Coast Guard Tomorrow

The Albany State wrestling
team suffered two losses this
past week as they were defeat.
ed by Potsdam on Wednesday by
a score of 23-11, and again on
Saturday when they lost to Ho-
bart by a score of 26-10. The
grapplers record now stands at
one win and seven losses. The
Great Danes have now lost their
last four matches.

Against Potsdam, the onlywin.
ners for Albany were Eric Watts
at 130, Bill Clark at 137 and
Fran Weal at 145. All three vic-
tories were decisions as Watts
outpointed Chuck Davenport 11-5,
Clark outscored Joe Erin 9-2,
and Weal recorded a 14-6 vic-
tory over Joe Laffler. Albany
forfeited both the 123- and heavy-
weight divisions thus giving up
a valuable ten points.

The only other points for the
Great Danes were recorded by
Dave Lambert as he wrestled
his man to a 1-1 draw. Craig
Springer, at 152, lost a 13-5 de.
cision, Marshall Gladstone suf-
fered a pin in 4:55 at 167, and
Roger Gorham lost 3-2 at the 177-
pound weight class.

in the match against llobsrt,
Albany was able to come up
with only two winners. Craig
Springer, wrestling at 152 do-
cisioned his man 4-0 and Roger

only Clark and Gotham have

Clark, the only senior on the

as Gorham is 4-4.

At 123 for Albany Alex Dum-.

by a score of 4-2. Fran Weal,
wrestling at 145, was pinned by

while recording only one. Mar-
chail Gladstone again suffered a
pin as his shoniders were forc-
ed to the mat at 1:51. Albany
again forfeited the heavyweight
division and thus gave up five
points.

The wrestling team this year
has been hampered by a lack of
depth, particularly in the upper
weight classes as they have been
forced to forfeit the heavyweight
spot ever since the beginning of
this semester. in addition, some
wrestlers have been forced to
participate with painful injur-
ies as there has been no one
to replace them.

 

NCAA Small College Tour-
nament.

Coach Dick Sauers’ quin-
tet proved deserving of the
bid this week as it tripped
arch-rival Siena, 79-72, on
Monday and trounced New
Paltz 80-56, on Wednesday.

Regarding a possible tourney
berth, Director of Sports infor-
mation, Richard Rice, Jr., has
released the following informa-
tion. That, (1) C. W. Post, Far-
leight Dickinson, the University
of Rochester, LeMoyne, and Al-
bany State are under considera-
tion for three of the four at-
large bids in the‘regional; (2)
one of the above teams, exclud-
ing Albany, will be selected as a
host team for the tourney and
thereby receive a berth; and (3)
the NCAA committee will se-
lect the deserving squads some-
time early next week.Therefore,
the Albany contests against
lthacs and Cortland next week-
end will have no bearing on the
Sauersmen's chances for their
first NCAA tournament.

Buffalo State has the fourth
position automatically for win-
ning the State University Con-
ference championship.

All that one could ask for was
packed into the Albany-Siena con-
test. Playing before an estimat-
ed SRO crowd of 2,200 and with
over 1,000 fans stranded out-
side Cardinal McCloskey, the
Great Danes and Indians hooked
up in a tangle that will remain
in the memories of many for
a long time to come.

Led by junior standout Rich
Margison, the Danes got off to
a quick 7-0 lead. Keeping the
pressure on, the Purple and Gold
raced to a 17-4 lead with 13:30
remaining and left the court at
halftime with a 46-34 advantage.

After Scott Price hit on a
jumper to put the Danes ahead
by 14 at the start of the second
stanza, Coach Tom Hannon's
crew went on a 30-13 tear to
lead 64-59, with about eight min-
utes remaining.

Trailing 68-64, with four min-
utes to go, the Danes then rip-
ped off eight straight points to
go ahead, 72.68, a lead which
they never lost.

Margison, who scored a game
high of 25, hit four key baskets
in the final drive, three on spec-
taculnr driving lay ups.

The New Paltz affair was no
contest as the Danes raced to
a 47-24 halftime lead and kept
the margin at around 25 points
throughout the remainder of the
game. it was the Sauersmen’s
12th win in a row, equalling the
mark set by the 1004-05 team.
They will have a chance to break
it tomorrow night at Pratt.

The last home game of the
season is this Wednesday, Feb-
runry 20, at 0:30 p.m., against
Oneontn.

Conference Issues '
Emphasize Tactics

by Kathy Deyoe
A conference on Vietnam,
“How Can We End the War?",
placed the main emphasis on
issues of foreign policy and peace
movement tactics. The panel dis-

cussion, “Definition of the.

Problem," was given on Friday
night by three noted speakers,
Tran Van Dinh, Noam Chomsky,
and Sanford Gottiieb.

Reverend Frank Snow begun the
program stating “we are taking
part in what is going to be a
provocative and important issue

facing us as a people." Jonathan '

Mirsky moderated the panel dis-
cussion. He commented that the
United States cannot win the war,
but it is not going to withdraw
until it has concealed military
defeat under a sheet of fire.

Tran Van Dinh discussed the
history of Vietnam and the Viet-

Dow, Draft Policy Discussed
At President’s Conference

by Tim Keeley

The student demonstration
against the Dow Chemical Com-
pany and the announcement of the
University's Selective» Service
statement concerning the new
policy were the main topics dis-

‘eussed Monday by President Evan

R. Collins atihe President's Con-
ference with Students.

Collins released the statement
agreed upon by the presidents
of the four university centers,
with regard to the recent Selec-
tive Service policy. The four
presidents feel “the policies an-
nounced on February 16 serve to
compound the existing inequities
of the draft system."

Although the State University
system will stiffer if graduate
students are drafted, it will not
feel the pinch as much as other
universities. Many universities
rely upon graduate students to
teach undergraduate courses.

The statement suggest that
"the military services be auth-
orized to place an inactive duty,
without pay, any individual in-
ducted into the armed forces
who has been admitted as a stu-
dent in good standing to a gradu-
ate or professional program that
will increase the value of his
services to the nation.”

A signed copy of their state-
ment is being delivered to Pres-
ident Johnson, General Lewis B.
Hersey, and the head of the Na.-
tional Security Council.

President Collins clarified the
arrest of students last week in
connection with the Dow Chemical
incident. “Those students ar-
resth were not arrested for de-

monstrating." Collins pointed out
that the students were arrested
for disorderly conduct.

When asked what action was
being taken against those appre-
hended, Collins divided them into
two categories. “For those peo-
ple now in civil courts, we will
do nothing while their cases are
pending.” in reference to the
other 57 individuals, Collins
pointed out that LAAC will hold
hearings. The recommendations
of this Commissionwill than be
forwarded to'the Faculty Student
Committee on student Conduct
for further consideration.

Several students attending the
conference asked why lD’s were
collected by the Security Police.
Dr. Clifton B. Thorns clarified
this statement by saying, "1
asked the security patrolman to
determine the identity of the dis-
orderly demonstrators. The stu-
dents gave their 1D cards to the
patrolman; none were re-
quested.”

President Collins commented
that if a person is brought be-
fore the LAAC hearing, and was
a non-violent demonstrator, he
should plead innocent to the
charges.

Thorns also added, “At 9:25
a.m. the University policy of
December 17 prohibiting harass-
ment was violated. if we erred,
we erred by not taking police
action sooner.”

Collins concluded by sub-
mitting a new bus schedule to
the University community. "This
schedule is complete to date,"
he declared. But a student re-
joined “and probably for today
only."

MYSKANIA Nominees Approved
At Central Council Meeting

by Vic Looper

Central Council defeated abill
(5-19-1) to hold a. referendum to
decide whether the Student As-
sociation Assessment (Student
Tax) should be separated from
the Athletic Assessment on each
student's bills,and approved (20-
0-1) the MYSKANIA nominees
list, at its emergency meeting
Thursday, February 22.

The Athletic separation bill
introduced by Judith Mills
would have directed the Election
Commission to hold areferondlun
at the same time as the MYSKAN-
IA elections. All students would
have been able to vote regard-
less of whether they have paid
student tax.

in order for the referendum
to be accepted, it would have re-
quired a majority vote with at
least 20 per cent voting.

Mills believes that the referen-
dum should be conductedbecause
the University is the only state
school which still has both stu-
dent tnx and athletic tax together.

Duncan Nixon stated that just
because other schools separate
the assessments does not mean
that we should. lie asked why
athletics had to be singled out
and said that perhaps concerts,
plays etc. should also he separ-

Jsmes Kuhn countered this ar-
gument by saying the taxes are
separated at the Business Office
and that once they are separated

the student have very little con-
trol over the way it is spent.

He argued that this bill itself
would not separate the tax but
would give the students a chance
to decide whether they wanted
it separated.

Paul Breslin believed that the
bill should have a certain per-
centage of students voting before
it could be considered valid.
The bill was then changed to
allow for at least 20 per cent
participation when it was voted
on before it could be considered
valid.

The question was asked by
James Winslow if some schools
had to suspend athletics for ase-
mester once the tax was separ-
ated. President Jeffrey Mishkln
responded in the affirmative, to
Winslow's question.

Margaret Dunlap reasoned that
if the students were really in-
terested in athletics, they would
pay for it, even if it was se-
parated.

She believes that. if they were
not interested, that the current
method of billing forced students
to support a program they did
not want. The best method would
be to allow the students to choose
to support either athletic tax
or student tax, or both.

Paul Breslin stated that if
this biliwere passed that it might
mean the end of the athletic pro-
gram of the University. Kahn than
reiterated that the students

 

should not be denied the right

to choose whether they wanted
the two taxes separated or not.
Suzanne Budd of MYSKANIA
