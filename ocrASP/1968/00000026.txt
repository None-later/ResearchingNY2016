Meaning of Grad Deferment Loss

(CPS) There will be nodraft
deferments for graduate students
next fall, except those already
in their second or subsequent
year of graduate schoolandthose
in "medical, dental, and allied
medical specialties."

Selective Service Director
Lewis Hershey, acting under
‘advice from the National Security
Council, gave the order Friday
ina telegram to all state sel-
ective service directors. stu-
dents now in their first year of
graduate study will be allowed
to complete this year, but will
not be deferred next fall.

Unless there is a change in
the method of selecting draftees,
the order means that most stu-
dents graduating from college or
completing their first year of
graduate school this spring win
be drafted soon after graduation.
At present, the oldest registrants
are drafted first and students
graduating from college are gen-
erally older than most other draft
eligible men.

Hershey's Friday order also
abolished all occupational defer-
ments, except those which local
draft boards grant "based on

a showing of essential commun-
i need." Previously the Na.
tional Security Council main-
tained lists of "essential and
critical" occupations for which
deferments were automatic.

Those lists included many tacti-
nical occupations, plus public
school teachers. School teach-
ers, however, will probably still
be deferred by their local boards
under the “essential community
need" provision.

In making its recommendation
the Security Council said gradu-
ate deferments are not in the
national interest. it noted "the
absence of a significant military
manpower need served by gradu-
ate school deferments.

Noting that graduate de-
ferments "can be pyramided Into
exemption from military ser-
vice,” the security Council said,
“This is unfair—particularly in
time of armed conflict—to all
the young men who do not have
the opportunity or the finances
to attend grad school."

The Security Council also said
that granting deferments for cer-
tain categories ofgraduate study,
such as the natural sciences,

lean.

Gotilieb’s main stand can be
summed up in one remark he
made which received strong ap-
plause from the audience, “When
the problem has to be defined,
1 would suggest removing the
present administration from pow-
er.”

Noam Chomsky pointed outthat
the only weapon that can be used
is terror. He felt that the 0.8.
is justaregime maintainingsome
of the forms of the democratic
process, but which involved only
a small portion of this nation.

The program included ,, the

panel discussion on Friday night
"Definition of the Problem,"
a film entitled “The Survivors,"
about war-injured children in
Vietnam. On Saturday the pro-
gram began with a panel discus-
sion: "What are the Possible
Solutions?”

A continuation of the discus-
sion in small groups with speak-
ers as resource people fouowed.
This panel included Jonathan Mir-
sky, Alfred Hassler, and Tran
Van Dinh. The next panel dis-
cussion was "How Can We ln-
fluence U.S. Actions?" The panel
included Gerald Taylor, George
willoughby, Sanford Gottlieb, and
Noam Chomsky.

After this discussion small
group discussions divided into
three categories: l_. Electorial
politics and political education
ll. Civil disobedience and radio
action; Ill. The other two cats-
gories combined were held.

Two films, "Vietnam: How Did
We Get In? How Do We Get
Out?” and “The Voyage of tile
Phoenix" were shown.

All the speakers p...

in a discussion, “Where Do We
Go From Here?" which ended
the program.

The final session of the Tri-
City Peace Conference movedto-
wards its goal of stimulating
active support for actions that
“will attempt to provide some
measure of hope to the Ameri-
can people and the Vietnamese
people."

Tran Van Dinh suggested the
formation of a “Committee to
Rebuild the City of Hue," which
is the symbol of unity to the
Vietnamese people.

Interest was expressed in pro-
viding stronger community sup-
port for the Community of Re-
sponsibility, the organization
which Is bringing war-injured
South Vietnamese children to the
United States for medical care
which is not available in South
Vietnam.

The Albany and Schenectady
County Coalitions for a Demo-
cratic Alternative called for
more people to start actively
supporting Senator McCarthy.

Some of the participants re-
quested others to join them in
the signing telegrams addressed
to President Johnson, Senator
Javita and Kennedy and Congress-
man Button calling for an imme-
diate end‘ to the bombing of
North and South Vietnam and
the beginning o‘f peace talks.

A few participants expressed
their personal sentiments in call-
ing for the impeachment of Pres-
ident Johnson. ,

The suggestions calling for
humanitarian aid of some kind to
the Vietnamese people received
the greatest support from those
who participated in the con-

would be unfair and would result
in "Distortions. . .from the ten-
dency (of students) to selectdraft
deferred fields of study" over
others.

The decision was based on re-
commendations from Secretary
of Labor Williard Wirtz, Secre-
tary of Commerce Alexander
Trowbrldge, and Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare
John Gardner. -

The Council did order Gardner,
Wirta and Trowbridge to “main-
tain a continuing surveillance
over the Nation's manpower and
educational needs to Identify any

,area of graduate study that may

warrant qualifying for deferment

in the national interest."

Statement

Drawn Up ByKnight

A number of professors in the
Graduate School of Babiic Affairs
have signed a statement in ref-
erence to graduate student draft
deferments drawn up by Jonathan
Knight, lechlrer in the GSPA.

Written in "reaction to a di-

rective dram the National Secur-

.ity Council)," Knight said that

there is no concerted effort on
the part of the faculty, college
seniors, graduate students nor
any nation-wide movementtopro-
test the recent change in gra.
duate deferment policy. This is

not an attempt to solidify such

The statement reads:

"The decision of the National
Security Council to suspend in-
definitely most graduate student
draft deferments does not remove
draft inequalities, and poses a
serious threat to higher educa-
tion In the United States.

By reducing the number ofper-
sons earning higher degrees, the
decision derives colleges, indus—
try AND government of necessary
teachers, researchers and advi-

sors.

By creating uncertainty as to
draft status the decision dis-
rupts higher education and Im-
pedes the efforts of the graduate
student.

We urgently ask you to re-
consider a decision which bane.
fits no one, and only fosters
greater confusion and dissent
throughout the country."

Michael Moss, assistant pro.
fessor of Political Science, did
not sign the statement; he be.
lieves there should be a thor-
ough investigation of the whole
draft system."

Moss was speaking specifical-
ly in view of the recent changes
that have taken place concerning
graduate deferments, and also In
reference to a report given by
Betty Vetter, executive director
of the Scientific Manpower Com-
mittee‘ which listed the total draft
pool available for the 1968-69
school year as 1,183,500 men.

Of this number, the college
graduate total Is 319,500 men
(including male baccalaureates,
1987-68; first year full-time grad-
uate students, first registered for
Grad Study in 1967-68 school
year; male master's degrees, and

' Ph.Ds).

As in as Moss knows, all
of these men will be drafted bar-
ring local draft board deferments
as the administration is placing
them at the top of the eligibil—
ity list because of the age ele-

ment.

General Studies
School To Relate
V e
To Community
by Ira Wolimnn

“An attempt to better relate
the University tothe community"
Is one of the purposes of the
School of General Studies, as
seen by Dean Irving A. Veer-
schoor.

The School of General Studies,
founded two and a half years ago,
Is oriented towards the adult or
part-time student who wishes to
take College level courses for a
variety of reasons. Lumped under
the general headlng of“ContInu-
Ing Education," Dr. Veerschoor
feels that there Is a “diversity
of worlds" in the continuing
education field.

At present, there are over 500
students taking courses through
the school. They are offered any
of 43 courses they may wish to
take. The subjects offered range
from Elementary Russian to Eng-
Ilsh Composition, with a great
variety of subjects lntermlxed.

Most students take night
courses here at the University,
but the school may place them
In day classes also. It Is "an
individual student with individual
problems that we are dealing
with” Dr. Veerschoor stated.
Each student ls given classes
that, If at all possible, will best
suit him.

As the University gets larger,
the plans for various branches
also expand. In the planning
stages at this date is a “Con-
tInulng Education Center" for
the School of General Studies.
This center would allow the
school to expand by offering more
course to more students. Pre-
sently, there Is only one center
In New York State, located at
Syracuse. Plans for this center
would Include workshops, sem-
inars, and classes for the in-
terested students.

The school does not presently
have a teaching faculty ofitaown.
All professors are University
teachers who have agreed to take
on the added classes. The faculty
of the school at this time 15 com-
posed of five men In administra-
tive positions.

The reactions ofthe community
have been “very good" accord-
lng to Veerschcm. He states that
“Word of mouth of satisfied stu-
dents has been our best adver-
ilslng."

Any person lnterestedlnenter-
ing the school may contact them
and arrange for an Interview.
Most students carry no more
than three courses carrying the
equivalent of 9 credit hours.

Psi Gamma To Celebrate
70 Years Of Sisterhood

Psi Gamma sorority Is cele-
brating Its 70th anniversary this
month. In honor of the occasion,
the present 96 sisters and the
alumni have planned a reunion
for the weekend of March 29-31.

Activities for the weekend will
include a block of seats for the
Special Events Board concert on
Friday night, followed by cock-
tails at the Ambassador Club.
On Saturday, there will be an

open lounge and coffee hour, and»

on Saturday night, a cocktail
hour and dinner-dance at the
Golden Fox.

Psi Gamma was founded In
1898, as a literary club, by
Edith Stoneman and Gertrude
Hall, with the help of Dr. Wil-
liam J. Milne. L. Elizabeth Read,
3 Cornell graduate, taking a post
graduate course at the Univer-
sity, was elected the first pre-
sident. Margaret S. Mooney, head
of the English Department, was
the first faculty advisor.

At first, meetings were held
In the homes of the members,
but In 1906, they rented an apart.
ment on Madison Ave. for meet-
ings and started making plans
for a sorority house. In 1924
the girls moved to their first
house on Madison Ave.

Since 1927, the sorority
sisters have had houses on South
Lake Ave., Western Ave.. Madl-
son Ave., and Hudson Ave. In
1965 they moved to their present
location in Van Rensselaer Hall
or. the Dutch Quadrangle.

Since Its inception asallterary
society, the sorority has under-
gone many changes. Today,
sisters are Involved in many
University actlvltes. LynnHewltt
represents the sorority on
MYSKANIA, while Peggy Carrol,
Maggie Dietz, Lynn Hewitt, Gerry

Masters, Madeline Schnabel, and
Carol Walling represent the
sorority on Who's Who.

In addition, Maggie Dietz is

sister, Mrs. Kenneth S, Macaffer,
sits on the University Council.

The sorority placed second In
the Homecoming Float Contest,
Holiday Sing, and the ISO
Scholarship Cup. Ann Tenbrook
served In the Queen's Court,
while Maggie Diets was In the
top 12 finalist In the State In the
National College Queen Contest.

In addition. the sororoity sisters
participate In community activi-
ties such as the Cancer Drive,
the Heart Fund Drive, the South
End Project, and the tutoring
service.

    

Pro-Registration System

At a recent interview, Dr. Rob-
ert B. Morris, Dean of the Uni-
versity College, explained some
of the intricacies of the new
advisement and pro-registration
system.

Dr..'Morrls is a member of
the six man team appointed by
Dr. Webb Flser, Vice President
for ‘Academic Affairs, to study
the University's registration
system. I

The committee compiled data
relating class year of students
with the courses they are tak-
Ing. An interesting finding re-
lvealed that 47 per cent of the
Juniors and seniors are enroll-

. ed in courses on the 100 and 200

levels.

"With this data and the sub-
jective judgment of the faculty.
we have determined which
courses usually close early,"
commented Morris.

Using this Information, the
committee will compare the wish-
es of the students and the spaces
available In favored courses.

"On or about April 5 we hope
to create additional spaces In
courses If there is a demand."

Morris commented that while
the committee was interested
and aware that students want
specific teachers and times, the
students should first be able to
get the necessary course and
then perhaps the preferred In-
structor.

“There must always be a pri-
ority In selecting class cards,"
continued Morris. “In our judg-
ment the alpha rotating system
Is fairest to all."

Under this system, all stu-
dents whose names begin with
the letter "k" will be given the
first chance to draw class cards.
"The letter 'k' was randomly
selected with the understanding
that the alpha rotating system will
continue.”

When prereglstratlon begins,
it Is expected that several sen-
Iors will be closed out of courses.
"A senior closed out should go
to his adviser to make arrange-
ments to be signed Into a course
he needs to fulfill graduation
requirements.”

After May 10, when pre-regis-
tration closes, the committee
plans to look at the number of
spaces available in courses with
the anticipated demand of 1,700
new freshman and 400 transfers.

In the past freshmen and soph-
omores have been at a disadvant-
age ln selecting courses in the

   

disciplines. "Those students
were not allowed to experience
the disciplines or to allow the
influence of the disciplines to
help themdetermine a major."
The Alpha misting system puts
all classes, at an equal advantage.
"It Is necessary for the Uni-
versity to have 'a multiple time
period for advisement," Morris
pointed out. The time taken for
advisement depends upon many
things; the University College
takes many weeks, whereas the
School of Social Welfare may
only take several hours.
when asked why the preregis.
tratlon system wasn't thrown
open to all students without re-
gard to priority, Morris cited
the following incident: In the
spring of loss preregietration
Ias to begin at 9 a.m. Monday.
No priorities were recognized
L- the ambitious student would
benefit. At midnight Sunday, stu-
dents began to assemble at Drap-
er In sleeping bags. By 8:00 in
the morning Draper was well to
wall people in every corridor.
"When the students left,‘Draper
was a shanble, with broken win-
dows, litter on the floors, and
several people Injured."

Copeland Joins
Econ. Faculty

Dr. Morris A. Copeland, dis-
tinguished economist, has joined
the University faculty as a pro
fessor of Economics. Since his
recent appointment he has been
teaching the graduate seminar ln
economic theory.

Additionally, he Is active In
faculty seminars of the econo
mics department of the doctoral
program in economics and guides
the research work of graduate
students In economics and politic-
al theory.

Copeland has received his
bachelors degree from Amherst
College, which also honored him
with the award of a Doctorate In
Humane Letters, and his doctor-
ate In economics from the Uni-
verslty of Chicago.

His distinguished academic and
professional career includes
faculty appointments at Cornell
University, the University of
Michigan, and the University of
WIsconsln Emerimentleollege.

He was also a Fulbright leo-
turer at the Delhi School of
Economics in India. Copeland
has also served with the Na-

tional Bureau of Economics Re- '

search.

 

 

Congress rejected that idea In
June, however.

Gustave 0. Arlt, president of
the U,S. Council of Graduate
Schools; said he was "Appalled"
at the new regulations. He chal-
lenged the Security Council state-
ment that graduate deferments
are not In the national interest.
“The national Interest requires
that we continue to produce an
adequate number of highly
trained personnel to serve in
government and Industry.

Arli said that If graduate stu-
dents are reduced by about 40
per cent under the new regula-
tions, the 0.8. will not reach
Its present level of production
of graduate students until l972.
Graduate schools will have a
tough time admitting applicants,
silica they will not know whether
or not the student will be drafted.
