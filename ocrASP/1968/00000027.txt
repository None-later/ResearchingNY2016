Dow DemonSt

by Ellzobeth Andersen

Ten people were arrested on

last Wednesday as a result of
a demonstration against the pres-
ence of n DowChemicalCorpora-
tion interviewer onCumpus.They
were arraigned the next day upon
charges brought forward by the
University; they will appear in
court on March 18. Fifty-seven
others will go before LAAC lu-
dicisl board as result of their
actions in the demonstration. The
following is a recount of events
lending up to the arrests.

9:00 s.m. — Four Students
were present Wednesday morning
in the foyer of the Administra-
tion Building and the Dow in-
terviewer was in Room 160.

9:15 a.m. — The majority of
the group had arrived and were
sitting down.

10:00 a.m.—-The whole group
was sitting down in the corri-
dor in iromt of Room 160 and
the Dow Chemical Corp. posi-
tion was released.

The group allowed passage to
everyone, only hindering those
applicants seeing the Dow inter-
viewers. The by-standers includ-
ed only about 10 YAF members
and newsmen.

Dr. Clifton Thorne, Vice Pres.
ident for Student Affairs, stated
that the University would allow
the group’s protest if conducted
in an orderly manner.

12:25 p.m. — The door was
opened and about 0 to 9 of the
group pushed and fell into Room
160. The interviewer went to
the room across the hall. Se-
curity police blocked the door
to keep the demonstrators in
the room and the others out.

Thorne asked the security po-
lice to identify those in the room.
Instead, ID cards and names of

 
   

5'7 eope n ung as n e
room and some in the corridor
were handed in.

1:00 p.m. — The interviewer,
escorted by two security guards,
went to the Partoon Room for
lunch; the group went to the
snack bar.

2:20 p.m. — With the nonop-
pearunce of the interviewer, the
group decided that he had been
moved to another room. They
were subsequently told he was
in Room 150. The group's num-
bers had increased significantly.

Security police tried to keep
demonstrators and hecklers sep-
srsted.

James Connolly, of the secur-
lty police, asked the demonstrat-
ors to clear the alsle.’l‘he group
cleared a passage way.

3:45 p.m. —— The demonstrat-
ors seated, hooked arms to keep
an applicant from an interview.

3:55 p.m. — The demonstrat-
ors chanted l'Dow go home!"
for the first time.

4:00 p.m. —— Another appli-
cant tried to see thelnterviewer;
the group stood up and hooked
arms. They chanted again. Sev-
eral security men tried to push
the group from the door.

Dr. Clinton Roberts, head of
Placement Service, told the dem-
onstrators he believed they were
breaking the limits set by the

university for peaceful demon-
strntlon.

The group continued to stand
and block the door. At this time.
Thorne considered the demon-
stration to be illegal because it
violated students' rights by pre-
venting them from seeing the
interviews.

Vice president Olson talked
to the demonstrators; he said
“the people are going to see
the interviewer. lfthey are block-
ed the administration will have to
take action."

The group suggested that if
the interviewer were moved to
the Thruway Motor Motel, they
would disperse. He told them
they were "obstructionlsts" and
the proper authorities would be
co‘l'lezd5. A few of the group moved.

: p.m. —- The rou t
down. Mr. Connolly guvge higﬂzt
warning that they were violating
the law. The security police
were given clubs.

Dr. Robert Morris told the
security police to use the clubs
only for their own protection if
needed. Bystanders were told
to stand back and clear the cor-
ridor. All afternoon some of
the bystanders had heckled. Now
they were quiet and moved away.

Eventually, only ten to fifteen
people were left. They declared
they would only go if all went.
Others persisted in persuad-
ing these to go. After which,
only four remained sitting. Mr.
Connolly made his third and final
warning.

He informed the four sitting
that they were under arrest.
They were arrested by the Cam-
pus security police, who have the
authority to do so.

Charged with disorderly con-
duct, the four were escorted out
to a police car. Mr. Connolly
told the Campus Police to put
them on the university bus that
Thorne had called. Meanwhile,
the Albany police were waiting
on reserve at the Thruway
Motor Inn.

The other six of the ten or-
rested suid in trying to persuade
the tour not to be arrested or
inquiring at the bus if the four
wanted others to accompany them;
they were told to get on the bus
and were arrested.

The security police, when ask-
ed, snld anyone entering the bus
would be arrested. No one on the
bus resisted arrest.

They stopped making com-

ments. In the end ten people
were arrested, taken down to dis-
trict 2 of the Albany police,
charged and a bell of $50perper-
son was set. They were released
at ’7 p.m. after their balls had
been paid.

6:00 p.m. — Thorne who re.
moined calm and tsctful through
most of the day, sometimes quiet-
ly standing by and watching the
demonstrations summarized the
events of the day to television
newsman. He explained that the
students were arrested when they
began to interfere with univer-
sity business.

The crucial effect of this
demonstration culminates in the
sides solidifying. The Admlnls.
tration will now uphold a policy
more stringent than before as
concerns demonstrations when
previous their lenient attitude al-
lowed for support of protests.
They have no choice in tighten-
ing up the policy because they
also must protect the rights of
others in the academic commun-
ity and support their own actions
as Administrations. A group of
sincere and deeply committeed
people who were willing to act
in accord with their convictions
will be alienated from the univer-
sity system. Thus the situation
is one of increasing antagonism
between two divergent viewpoints
and becoming one of disincline-
tlon to exchange opinions be-
tween them.
