a... Festival and Campus Cari
sival from Thursday, May a to
Sunday, May a are well under
way. These activities are being
scheduled to provide a lull week:
-end with as little overlapping oi
iunctions’as possible. .

A similar weekend was held
last year when the Jan Festival
and Campus Carnival were
scheduled tor the same time due
to a lack of suitable times for
programming. This ‘year Pa.-
rent's Weekendwas added to the
slate.

Campus Carnival includes
Gentle Thursday and state Fair,
an annual festival for which Greek
groups, dorms, and other or-
ganisations construct carnival—
type booths. Some entires in past
years and sure to be in evidence
again, are the BZbust(balloons),
Sig car wreck. Contributions col-
"lected from these bootlls are used
tor the student Ambassador pro-
gram.

Those groups preparingbooths
for State Fair should plan to
have‘them ready at 11 pm. on
sat., May 4. storagespacewillbe
provided so that booths may be
prepared on Friday.

The Jazz Festival, held for the
first time last year, is presently
being planned to include one
large, big name concert and
several smaller performances.

Coupled with these will be
Parent's Weekend which is slat-
ed to include adinner and several
receptions.

Stewart Publishes
Bio Handbook

Dr. Margaret M. Stewart, pro-
f"lessor of biological sciences, at
the University, is the author of
"Amphibians of Malawi,” pub-
lished by the State University of
New York Press.

The work is a handbook for the
herpetologist (one who studies
reptiles and amphibians) in-
terested in African amphibia.
Stewart limits her study to the
species found in Malawi, but the
population in that small country
is representative of much oi
Saharan Africa. Thus, the volume
contributes to thescant literature
on African amphibia.

Based on extensive field notes
made during a year’s stay in
Malawi. Stewart's bookie supple-
mented by museum andllterature
research. The author has illu-
strated her work with more than
600 detailed drawings and in-
cludes 20 full color photographs.

She has been‘a member of the
University faculty since 1956.
Her professional society mem-
berships include those in the
American Association for Ad-
vancement of Science, North
Carolina .Academy of Science,
the American Institute at Bio-
logical Sciences, and the Ameri-
can Society at Ichthyologlsts and
Herpetologists.

The search to locate our old-
est alumni ln an attempt to dis-
cover information about “the
good old days" was not an easy
task. With the cooperation of our
Alumni Office, we were able to
find Elisabeth Huggins Bullard oi
Schuylerville, the school's
second oldest alumni.

Mrs. Bullard was graduated
from the State Normal School in
1887 at the age of seventeen.

it may be difficult for us to
conceive of the fact that theState
Normal School was at that time
merely a year-long ordeal, which
Mrs. Bullsrd remembers asbor-
dering on "slavery."

She remembers her one year
of college as "the most wonder-
ful time of my life." Communi-
cation with Mrs. Bullard pre-
sented a problem, as she is
blind and hard oi hearing. How-

every, she was anxious to be of
whatever help she could.

Mrs. Bullsrd took collrses in
English, Math, FrenchandAmer-
lean History, her major. There
were no courses in education at
the time, nor was there any
emphasis placed upon teaching
techniques, although 100 per cent
or the 57 graduates did become
teachers.

The school did not offer the
conveniences of dormitory llv.
ing in 1887, so "Lllzie"Huggins
lived with an Albany iamily. She
did not show any recognition at
the mention of Minerva, but she
described a 11:39 stained glass
'v’iﬁdow alsp yed in a building
on the Hamilton Street campus.
(The window has since been de-
stroyed by fire.)

Mrs. Bullard eventually taught
in many areas, including Nevada,
Salt Lake City, and Fee Alto,
California. She emphasized the
fact that the Teacher's School
at Albany had a "fabulole re-
putation all over the country."
She bemoans the fact that to-
day's youth are "unable to get
up on their feet and speak in-
telligently" and remembers the
Friday aiternoons she spent at
the weekly "rhetoricals," at
which time students usually re.
cited poetry or original essays.

A rab-A merican Speaks
On Israel, Jerusalem

To The Editor:

The actions of Israel in regard
to changing the status of the Old
City of Jerusalem have clearly
proven that Israel has disregard-
ed the U.N. resolutions of July
4 and July 14, 1967. The former
requested Israel to cease its
steps toward annexation. The
latter deplored lsrael’s noncom-
pliance with the July 4 resolution
and reiterated its appeal tolsrael
to rescind all measures already
taken and to desist forthwith from
taking any action which would
alter the condition of Jerusalem.

Instead of answering the chal-
lenge of the U.N. to the validity
of Israel’s actions, Israel chose
to talk on different levels and
raise different issues.

Basically the Israeli answer
contained three elements. The
first was a semantic argument
which attempted to deny that
"annexation" was the correct
term to be used In reference to
Israel's acquisition of Jordanian
Jerusalem. The second tried to
justify the occupation of the city
on the grounds of predicted ensu-
ing beneficial consequences.
Lastly, and most cynically, the
Israeli document endeavored to
convince the member nations that
the Israeli desire to add the
Jordanian Jerusalem to their own
state was altruistically motivat.
ed, based on genuinelsraelibene-
volencel

All of those who can read should
see the annexation of the Arab
sector ofJerusalem as an aggres-
sive action, for it is against the
simplest principles that the U.N.
stands for Israel has used
several false accusations by
which she has attempted to draw
the attention of the world away
from military occupation of Jor-
danian Jerusalem.

Perhaps the most absurd of
these accusations was the allega-
tion that the Arab Governments
has refused to safeguard free
access to the Holy Places. The
truth to the matter is that, in
response to an appeal by the
Conclllatlon Commission for
Palestine, the Arab governments
pledged themselves to thefollow-
ing declaration on November 15,

"The governments of Egypt,
Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria
undertake to guarantee freedom
of access to the Holy Places, re
Iiglous bulldlngs and sites sliuab
ed in the territory placed under
thelr authority by the final settle-
ment oftlle Palestine Problem or,
pending that settlement of the
territory at present occupied by
thenl under armistice agree-
ments; and. pursuant to this

understanding, will guarantee
rights of entry and oi transit
to ministers of religion, pil-
grims, and visitors without dis-
tinction as to nationality or faith
(emphasis supplied), subject to
considerations of national secur-
ity, all the above in conforming
with the status quo prior to May
14, 1948."

Israel in response to asimilar
appeal made by the Commission,
replied that it

". . . was of the opinion that
it would, in the circumstances, be
in the interests of a constructive
and final settlement if the matter
of iormulation were dealt with
at a later time after more far-
reachlng consideration of these
problems by the General
Assembly."

It is therefore distinctly clear
that Israel itself chose not to
make any commitments regard-
ing the Holy Places such as those
made by the Arabs, and lfaccess
to the Holy Places has been denied
in certain instances since 1949,

Israel has to thank only its own
intransigence for that.

Regarding the Israeli allega-
tion that there has been Arab
desecration of Jewish Holy
Places, I would like to point out
the well-known fact that the re-
ligious status quo in Jerusalem
was the object of the scrupulous,
reverent, and impartial guardian-
ship of Islam for more than a
millenium, nor is there anything
surprising in this. To Islam,
Jews and Christians are people
of the Book. Successive genera.
tions of Muslim pilgrims over
the centuries rubbed their
cheeks in humility and suppli-
cation on thresholds of the Tombs

of Abraham, David, Solomon,and
Moses. Millions of Muslims
across the arch of history have
sobbed in reverence at the birth-
place of Jesus and the Tomb of
the Virgin Mary.

Partly because of .thls fact and
partly because there are Arabs,
Jews, Christians, and Muslims,

O ., ..  
Discusses Johnson’

by Jill Paznill
Sta/f Reporter

Picking up the LBJ credibility
rap (which during the later ques-
tion and answer period he called
the credibility gulch), Peter J en-
nings said that this was not the
President's only problem. Ano-
ther was the cows at his ranch
not having children.

Johnson, being one to go right
to the top, called the chairman
of the Department of Agriculture
who said he would send a U.N.
bull. The bull arrived but noth-
ing happened.

Only after being cornered by
one of the cows did the bull ex-
plain, "I am a U.N. bull and
thereby here only in an advisory
capacity."

Setting the informal stage, J en-
nings proceeded by discussing
the two most important problems
today—Vietnam and Civil Rights.

"Vietnam is the first conflict
in which the press has operated
as a third force of inﬂuence. It
is almost exclusively responsible
in enabling people around the
world to
opinions."

Thousands of little battles
(military, social, political and
economic) make Vietnam “too
big a job to handle on a day to
day basis." Those who are not
covering the war in the field
listen to the " Five O’Clock Fol-
lies" — the government line
about our status in Vietnam.

Being the first television war,
Jennings said it was depressing
to see someone with a sandwich
in one hand and a beer in the
other watching men die in a war
that "is regarded In a much too

formulate their _

  

 

sensational wa .”

uWhat television does is pure-
ly microscopic. An attack on
Que Sanh viewed from the peri-
meter" does not indicate the ex-
tent of that battle, or what is
happening in the Mekong Delta.

"We have not at all brought
understanding," however, he
said, the American public eats it
up more and moreasthey realise
that American boys, boys from
their own block, are dying there.

Concerning Civil Rights Jen-
nings said, “Television has been
very guilty of sensationalism."
There have been a number of
cases where people have been
asked to repeat what they had
done because the cameraman did
not have it on film.

A Negro was asked to throw a
rock through a window a second
time. In Los Angeles picket signs
were made by newsmen for de-
monstrators so they would look
better on camera.

"Television," he admitted,
"has contributed to the intensifi-
cation ofpublic demonstrations."

"Television has an absolute
lack of really skilled people; a
reporter is a jack-of-ail-trsdes
with little proficiency in any."
He implied a need for specialists
in almost every area.

He knows of no business where
shop talk is so all-embracing in-
cluding topics such as banking,
wars, politics and religion. He
must enjoys talking with other
newsmen exaggerating about how
brave they all were under fire in
a trench somewhere.

Did the Arabs get a fair shake
in the recentArab-lsraeli crisis?
Nn, said Jennings during the

 

Q and A period, not at all. The
reason was not only because we
have a pro-lsraeli press but
American > interests for Arabs

was so much less (than for
israelis).

Here there was also slack oi '

“investigative reporting” ofthe
underlying mentality at what
"sent them off to war" against
the Israelis.

Whether or not the credibility
gap lies within the Johnson ad-
ministration or the press, Jew
nings could not say. He did say
that what reporters get out of
the White Hollse is very much
censored.

Asked if the Administration.

had ever lied to the American
public Jennings said that, in ef-
iect, it had. Newsmen were not
allowed to report that therewere
American soldiers in Thailand;
they were not allowed to film
bases in Thailand. They were
told that this was "diplomati-
cally necessary."

He considers the American
press mild compared to the
British news media. He said
there was a feeling at the cor-
porate level that the American
public can't take violence or ugly
reality on television.’

Jennings deplores the viewer
who thinks he cannot affect TV.
If you want to affect television,
he suggested two methods. En-
list the support of critics (“If
Jack Gould knocks a show the
management goes crazy; they

'really get upset") or subject

the station to an onslaught oi
letters. The most eiiective way
of influencing them "is to hit the
pocketbook."
