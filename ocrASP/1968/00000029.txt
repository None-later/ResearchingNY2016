The issues involved with the ar-
rest of ten students and the tak-
ing of names of 57 others in connec-
tion with the Dow demonstration
last week are confused and deeply
concerned with poor judgment on
several counts. ‘

First, while the demonstrators
remained for the most part peace-
ful, they, at some points, violated
the University policy of December
17 which prohibited demonstrators
from harassment and intimidation
of others. At times, they blocked
the passage to the recruitment
office making it difficult, if not
impossible, for prospective em-
ployees to enter and forcing, at
one point, the lifting of people
over the demonstrators.

Another mis-judgment was, ad-
mittedly, the non-action on the part
of the administration throughout
most of the demonstration. One of
the protest leaders com-
mented, "We were trying to keep
the demonstration within the pre-
scribed bounds, but as emotions
were aroused we could not. The
administration could have help-
ed us."

if the administration had stepped
in earlier, not to completely dis-
band the group, but to remind them
where the line between a peaceful
and lawful vigil and a disorderly
one lies, the demonstration might
have remained inside these bounds.
it would certainly have had a bet-
ter chance of doing so, and the
arrests might not have been neces-
sary.

Thirdly, the methods and effect

For Judgment

   

of hecklers and counter - demon-
strators must be taken into ac-
count. Charges have been made
that some of these individuals also
engaged in disorderly conduct,
though none of them are included
in the 57 persons whose names
were taken.

The counter-demonstrators ex-
ercised poor judgment in this case
also. Their existence and cause
was just as legitimate as that of
the anti-Dow demonstrators, and
they too were subject to all the
regulations of a demonstration.

Another factor which must be
considered is that the burden for
the insurance of a peaceful dem-
onstration which stays within the
prescribed bounds lies with the
demonstrators themselves, on both
sides of an issue.Mass psychology
is a tricky business and the lead-
ers must consider all the factors
in the organization of a protest.
Each individual involved must also
consider seriously the responsi-
bility for his own'actions, no mat-
ter What the outside pressures to
which he may be subjected.

Since the primary function of
this University is educational, we
hope that much has been learned
from this incident. in keeping with
this, we hope that the action recom-
mended by the LAAC Judiciary and
taken by the University inthe cases
of all the students involved will
reflect the charge of disorderly
conduct with the consideration of
the poor judgment exhibited by all
parties involved.

 

Alumni Quad, composed main-
ly of freshmen, is virtually iso-
lated from the rest of the Uni-
versity. The present arrange-
ment of the two campuses has
its advantages and disadvantag-
es; we feel, however, that if a
number of things were changed
almost all the negative aspects
of the present arrangement could
be eliminated.

The lack of upperclassmen on
the Alumni Quad and the travel-
ing time and effort involved in
reaching activities now centered
almost wholly on the new cam-
pus have prolonged the period of
freshmen assimilation to the Un-
iversity.

When the freshmen first came
here last fall they were isolated
from upperclassmen and none
of them knew what to expect. In
former years, a frosh at Alumni
had the upperclassmen on his
corridor to help introduce him to
the University's system . To make
the transition to university life
easier, next year’s freshmen
must have more contact with up-
perclassmen.

Further, most organizations
meet on the new campus; itwould
be a dedicated freshman who
joins any of these activities. If
a freshman wishes to attend a
Student Association governmen-
tal function, a club meeting or ev-
en use the library he must not
only waste 40 mlnuteson the bus,
but is forced to leave either
campus by the dictates of the bus
schedule (if the buses are follow-

 

MYSKANIA.. ’68 Do Nothing, ’69 Hope

Harry S Truman had his Do-
Nothing Congress; we have had
a MYSKANiA this year that falls
in the same category.

Last September members of
MYSKANiA '68 were trying to find
a purpose for their existence. The
conclusion they reached is exempli-
fied by the MYSKANIA bulletin
board across from the coat check
in the Campus Center.

A list of members of the Fresh-
men Class Council is posted there
with a notice dating the posting as
October 6, 1967. Not one member
of MYSKANIA '68 has had these

notices taken down.

Even in View of the antics (or
lack of antics) of this last MYS-
KANlA, there is a hope MYS-
KANiA '69 will create a place
for itself in the University. We
believe there is a purpose for
MYSKANlA's existence.

The members of MYSKANIA
could act as representatives of

the student body for social func- '

tions at and away from the Univer-
sity. Only one individual member
at a time need perform such a
function, thus spreading the re-
sponsibility among 13 people rath-

er than vesting it in the S.A.
President.

Since the students who sit on
MYSKANlA are usually special-
ized in student activities, they al-
so would be qualified to serve as
advisors to the administration.
If an administrator wants back-
ground on a project he is involved
in he might call on MYSKANIA
for help.

if MYSKANlA remains only as
an honorary, then it is worthless
to the student body and should be
defunct.

ing it). Next year the situation
will be compounded since the
theatre building and gym will be
open for concerts, plays, exhibi-
tions and games. Alumni fresh-
men must have better access to
the new campus or extra facili-
ties to use uptown or both.

To help diminish the problems
of the separate campuses several
measures could be taken. Some
upperclassmen could be allowed
to live on Alumni; flexible meal
tickets which could be used on
all quads could be given to all
students; lockers could be made
available to Alumni residences
(and commuters); the time inter-
val between bus runs could be
decreased.

The residence staff is serious-
ly considering allowing some up-
perclassmen to live on Alumni
Quad if they choose. We give
our support to this idea and feel
that these upperclassmen would
help next year's freshmen to ac-
climate themselves to the Uni-
versity.

The flexible meal card is no
new idea, but we urge Robert
Cooley of F.S.A. to arrange for
this service before the end ofthis
year, if at all possible. The flex-
ible meal card would enable Al-
umni freshmen to stay on the new
campus if they wished to attend
a function or use the library in
the evening.

Lockers, which could be plac-
ed in the corridor connecting
lecture rooms two and four, would
allow the Alumni resident to
store items he would need later
in the day instead of carrying
them around or going back to the
dorm for them.

One obvious aspect of group-
ing freshmen on Alumni is the
spirit of the students, which was
not evident on the quad lastyea r.
Waterbury Hall has had more
activities than last year. Aldon
Hall has at least one group of
girls who have formed a soror-
ity-like group; the girls of that
dorm out sung everyone else at
Holiday Sing. One need only on-
ter Bruato find that it has changed
from last year.

not kill!" Those are but two of
the clever phrases invented by
the lunatic fringe of the left last
week. The normal people yelled
at the demonstrators, "Bomb
with Bani"

The demonstration went over
as planned. Morality dreamers,
Communist dupes, and publicity
seekers jammed the corridor of
the Administration Building last
Wednesday for the purpose of
preventing as many as possible
from dotting the interviewer from
Dow. The goal of the protest was
also achieved: ten martyrs names
will now be remembered always
in the files of the Albany Police
Dept. They will endure in mem-
ory for their valiant stand against
the evilness of our rugged Uni-
versity Security Police Force.
The campus cops, given aholiday
from cruising cautiously around
the parking lot, took advantaged
the situation by protecting the in-
alienable human barrier right
of the left-wing extremists.

Only the, night before, the
brains of the SIS-Faculty Stu-
dent Committee coalition gather-
ed to pool their talents on how
was the best way to greet Dow
Chemical. After hours of intelli-
gent debate, the brain trust heard
at last the most ingenious solu-
tion. A 56-year-old third grade
youngster suggested, "Why don’t
you guys sit‘ in the hall?" All
the leaders agreed to follow up
on this brilliant suggestion.

in the early hours, of the dem-
onstration, it Was rather quiet.
The protesters, with their hearts
set on their noble cause, tripped
women applicants and asked aro-
busi member of our campus cops
to pass out their fiction. When
someone going out of Dow was
being tripped, he gave a protest-
or a kick to the head. Charges
of brutality were made. The po-
lice refused to allow a group of
moderates and conservatives to
walk through, and one memberof
the group said, "We'll go back,

“Defend the Toni" "Dow shall '

because we respect the law."
This, of course, was followed by
a nauseating chuckle by the pro-
testors. in the afternoon, when the
protestors left momentarily to
excrete some of the body wastes
they were full of, a group (1
Americans decided to turn the
tables and refused to allow the
weirdos back in. This was follow-
ed by a futile rush at the line.
And that was the only attempt at
physical violence during the day.
After the protest, one leader
said: “l'm very pleased with the
many kinds of people who sup-
ported us today." Those who did
can be placed into one of two

and those who should be in jail.

A good manyliberaisdisagreed

It’s All Greek To Me...

0f the hundreds of meetings and
innumerable committees in which:
I have participated in four years,
last week’s MYSANiA Screening
Committee was The Outstanding
Exception. The combined exper-
ience and contributions of the
members, from every major fac-
et of University activity, produc-
ed results which, hopefully, are
the best humanly possible.

However, during the course of
the meeting, l couldn’t help won-
dering about a sense of waste.
There are many good commit-
tees and meetings at this Univer-
sity, but they’re too few and far
between. Each has attended
events which we've felt were a
"bomb" or a"waste."This cam-
pus is notorious for being “the
meetingest place in the world."

it‘s trite and easy to say that
better organization and commun-
ication are the answer in curtail-
ing further future waste of time
and energy; perhaps indicating a
few specifics will help.

First, it's necessary to con-
sider inherent weaknesses. As an

 

 

On The Starboard Side

by Bert ncvorsetz

 

 

Before beginning to expound to
you my right wing extremist phil-
osophy a word of introduction.l
am the chairman ofthe university
chapter of Young Americans for
Freedom, so the highly conser-
vative slant will not be imagin-
ed, but real, though my work will
at least attempt at objective
thought that is often forgotten by
some of my moreliberal friends.

Wednesday, February Zl,was a
rather exciting day in our Ad-
ministration Building. it seems
there was a scuffle between union
and non-union maintenance people
over who should clean the floor.
Some of the non-union people
tried new methods of cleaning;
just sitting on the floor so it
couldn't get dirty. However, they
must have used some new clean-
ing fluid because the terrible
stench that was’left still remains
even now.

Seriously though, some very
fundamental rights were abridged
by the left-wingers in their pro-
test against Dow Cnemicnl. The
very obvious one was the right
of all students to walk through the
halls of our University unmolest-
ed. Members of YAF and broth-
ers of various fraternities dem-
onstrated this point quite clearly
by just attempting to walk
through. The clnw marks on my
leg from one of the female sav-
ages are still healing,thoughl’ve
been assured by doctors this was
not one of the demonstrators with
totnus.

Another right was that of Dow
uKent to conduct his interviewa.
Some say there is nothingthat can
be done, but, eureka, l have it.
The Civil Rights Law of 1964
makes it a federal offense for any
group to conspire to deny any in-
dividual his constitutional and
civil rights. on, l'm sorry this
doesn't apply to denying rights
to Dow agents and to student's
wanting interviews. it only is

good for Negroes in Mississippi
and Alabama. They have more
rights than other people. The
funny part is, the same people
who denied these rights to other
students would be the first to pro-
test against anyone abridging the
rights of groups. it's just about
time that the rights of middle
class America were taken into
account.

Finally, what probably dis-
turbed me most as the position
of the college administration.We
are told by Placement Office Of-
ficials that President Collins
doesn’t want any trouble so just
let them be. A security officer
told me that he could clear the
hall because of the obvious fire
hazard if only the administration
would let him. Well, maybe the ad-
ministration doesn’t care what
happens to the reputation of our
university, but l'm quite sure the
vast majority of students don’t
want their campus degenerating
into at Berkeley or Antioch or
Harpur where left-wing agitators
are consulted on all policy de'
cisions. This was demonstrated
by the maesive number of quickly
assembled counter - demonstra-
tors.

We call on our campus deans
to for once in their lives take
some sort of decisive action and
expell those students arrested.
We further recommend that all
campus demonstrations be limit-
ed to outside academic buildings
and then allowed only after the
rules of the university on the
conduct of such demonstrations
and the rights of other students
have been explained to the lead-
ers of the demonstration. if the
rules are abridged the Univer-
sity should disperse the demon-
strators. It‘s time the liberallcft
realized it's a privilege not a
right to attend college and it's
time the administration took a
stand against the dictation of
terms by leftvwing agitators.

example, candidates for MYS-
KANlA, our highest non-academic
honorary, are judged according
to five criteria: (1) contributions
to the University, (2) leadership,
(3) good judgment, (4) reliability,
and (5) initiative.

Students to receive this honor
would therefore be drawn from
two general areas, Student Gov-
ernment and Communications
Media. Three other areas also
merit consideration: Athletics,
Performing Arts, and fraternal
Greek groups.

Student Government and Com-
munications, however, receive
greatest consideration because
these two areas involve work
which may well demand the time
and energy of a full-time job.
What this boils down to is the
fact that a student is either ac-
tively involved or not; at this
stage of the University’s growth,
when an office moves from place
to place and new organizations
seem to sprout from nowhere
daily, there can be no middle
ground.

The traditional gripe that there
are those involved in campus ac-
tiyities merely for the personal
recognition is, at least for the
present, invalid. This is especial-
ly true in the case of those stu-
dents who sacrifice their ac-
cumes; they have to WANT to be
involved.

if this is truly an institution
of higher learning, it is hoped
that at some time a realization
will exist that all learning is not
vicarious. Recognition in the
form of a seat on MYSKANIA
would seem unworth the effort.
Yet in a University which is
constantly striving to improve
its academic quality, there hope-
fully comes atime when the think-
ing person will wonder how things
are being run and question pro-
cedures which have lead to tan-
gible results. Need it be said
that it’s much easier to sit back
and bitch?

Let's return to the problem
of those wasted meetings. if this
is really an educational insti-
tution, alleviation of part of the
problem lies in training people
who are to succeed in leadership
positions.

With the impending self-eval-
uation to be considered by the
Committee on Student Govern-
ment and Organizations (re-
quired by State Law) it is evi-
dent thut some sort of training
or lnculcntion is necessary with
respect to groups, too.

Our student government and
many subsidiary organizations
are in a situation where they are
organized, but floundering in
Inaintainance of their existence
and-or function. it is easy for this
year’s leaders and members to
look at those who will be in their
places next year and say, "it’s
up to you kids, good luck!"

To provide a useful continuity
which can be expanded according
to the needs of time and situa-
tion, we can look for the few re-
maining traditional institutions
at the University. Titers seem to
be only titres distinct ones: Min-
erva, MYSKANIA and Greeks.

ever symbolic, yet inanimate,

[Last week a conflict involv-
ing several Albany State stu-
dents made the headlines of Al-
bany's two news giants. in order
for those great metropolitan
newspapers to print the story
on the front page, it would have
to be a big one. it was. Of
course, no large newspapercould
possibly have covered this story
in as much depth as the ASP.
in the following space,“ in depth
report on: “Our First Realem-
onstration at Albany State."

it started as an idea being
kicked around the back of the
Snack Bar. Some of the people
back there wanted to do some-
thing to somebody in order to
give their existence on this cam-
pus some sort of justification.
Before the particular target was
chosen, the idea existed only
as some type of action to be
taken against some corporation
which dealt largely in death and
slaughter. Passing over Connec-
ticut Mutual insurance Co., and
the Albany Exterminating Serv-
ice, the organizers settled on
protesting against Dowchemical.
Particularly against their man-
ufacture of napalm and Saran
Wrap. (Napalm because it kills
Viet Cong who kill Americans,
and Saran Wrap because a steel
worker in Detroit was killed last
year when he ate his entire
lunch without first removing the
Saran Wrap; he choked to death.
This reason was later dropped.)

Another grave decision which
had to be made was as to the
form of demonstration to be
used. The choices were the
"march," and the “sit-in." The
march is known as such because
the participants use their feet

by Don Gonnott

to protest rather than their
heads. in tho ‘sit-fn they use an.
other, less noticeable stibstitute.
Naturally, the latter was chos-

en.

Finally, plans finished, 50
"love children" sat in; front of
the men's room last Wednesday
until the janitor informed them
that he definitely was not go-
ing in for an interviswﬂnd t' ‘
Itho Dow interviews were thro-
doors down. Thanking him, they
moved in front of that door and
just sat and sat and sat, not
even getting up for classesi

Most of the normal people
there thought that this would
lead to no good end. Their fears
were certainly justified when
the sitters kept out someone
who wanted to go in badly enough
that he asked a few friends,
40 or so, to help him get in.
At that point all looked dim
for the demonstrators. Then,
the courageous security police
entered the fray and disarmed
the protesters by relieving them
of their identity cards. Every-
one knows that a demonstrator
can’t function without his iden-
tity.

The rest is now history. Some
arrests were made, but no se-
vere action has or probably will
be taken against those respons-
ible. It seems that the majority
of us are doomed to be over-
ruled by a few people whobelieve
that their decisions are more
right than anyone else's. Actu-
ally, it’s probably better that
some of the interviews were
prevented. Someone may have
gotten a job, something quite
contrary to the creed of the
“love people."

 

 

Invisible Man On Campus

I. Mock

 

 

Calling all State students: there
is a course which needs support-
ing. Wake up and kill apathy,
be an active middle-of-the-road-
er. Support your rights to be in
the middle, to draw from the
left and the right; after all,
the middle is the most impor-
tant area.

What is a set of stage wings
without a stage to make them
needed; bird's wings without a
bird to fly. These examples point
out what radicalism docs for
our political system; the right
and left wing stands serve only
to emphasize the center, to abet
its usefulness.

This point is very important
to remember when you join a po-
litical group on campus. When you
take a particular stand, whether

it be on a moral or ideological
basis, you are condemning peo.
ple. You are accusing them of

. being wrong, and asserting the

conviction that you are right.

By coming down the middle
way, you needn't condemn any-
one; you can draw from the two
extremes, and create a unified
policy out of a political dich-
otomy.

The first meeting of all in-
terested people will be when two
of us meet anywhere. The prin-
ciple to which we are dedicated
is that all actions are gray in as-
pects; neither all leftist or all
rightist.

Accusation and persecution are
not the weapons ofdemocracy,but
knowledge and understanding are
its tools. The future, not the
present, is where our hope lies.
