View From The Behind

by M.D.S., and M.A.D.

 

During the week we have had
several arguments as to whether
the ASP readers are aware of
what is going on. To settle this
answer once and for all we are
presenting a campus wide multi-
ple choice exam.

1. The present purpose a
MYSKANIA is: (a) to further the
petty political ambitions of a se-
lect few; (b) to retain an sle«
ment of tradition from the days
when we were anobscure not-too-
good teacher’s college;(c)to pro-
mote fraternity and sorority un-
ity each year at election time
(d) to fill up another page in
the year book.

2. Members of Young Amer-
icans For Freedom are: (a) as
boorishly rude as is humanly pos-
sible; (b) with a few exceptions,
incapable of arguing intelligently
on any subject; (a) hypocritical
enough to support a war in which
they refuse to fight by accepting
a 2-5 deferment rather than an-

listing, prefering poor blacks and
whites to die in their place while
they talk.

3. Those arrested at a recent
sit-in are: (a) suffering from a
martyr complex; (b) unwilling to
grant others the right they them-
selves demand; (c) misguided in
a good cause; (d) want to “con-
front” an issue had enough to
create one.

4. The student body in general:
(a) is self-centered enough to
be blind to anything happening
outside their own little circle;
(b) is incapable ofelther generat-
ing or. being influenced by any

intellectual stimulation; (0) has,

never been forced to think logi-
cally, clearly or at all; (d) will
read nothing unless assigned in
a course, has their name in it,
mentions Jackie‘Kennedy or the
Beatles, or is on the level of
the Saturday Evening Pest,Read-
er's Disgust or anythingelse that
can be digested with little or no

Doro Passion

To the Editor: _

The attitude of SUNYA’s hu-
manitarian students, in theirpro-
test against DOW CHEMICAL
CORPORATION, raises some in-
teresting questions. Discounting
the pros and cons surrounding
the use of napalm, let us exe-
mine the reasoning which the
anti-Dow faction has set forth.

The FACTIONfasI shall hence-
forth refer to them, since they
did not identify themselves)
argues that "a corporation which
manufacturers chemistry sets
for teen-agers would be held re-
sponsible if a child were injured
or killed playing with it. We feel
Dow should be held responsible
for the deaths of the people in
Vietnam.”

Let us reduce this agrument
to its logical sbsurditywith some
other examples. Products from
U.S. Steel are used in war ma-
terials which kill people; Ford
Motors produce automotive parts
used in weapons carriers which
undoubtedly contribute to the
deaths of people; the agricultural
community grows food to feed the
soldiers who kill people.

This list is endless. Question:
Should U.S. Steel, Ford, General
Motors, the agricultural in-
terests be held responsible for
the deaths of the people in Viet-
nam?

The FACTION, unfortunately,
has directed its attack at the
wrong party. The agent respon-
sible for the use of napalm is
the Federal Government, not
Dow. Dow has every right to
manufacture napalm and has
every right to recruit employee
on this campus.

True to form, the FACTION
has set the ground rules deter-
mining who hss the fight to be
where and when, and—for what
purpose. Dow's position is wrong
because the FACTION disagrees
with them. Therefore, Dow should
not be allowed to recruit on
campus, or if they do have that
right, the humanitarians should
do everything possible to dis-
rupt Dow's procedures.

This attitude typifies the pseu-
dointeilectual character of our
campus leftists.

The FACTION has the right to
protest the evils of war. I sug-
gest, if they wish to exercise
this right, that they think first,
then act accordingly. The emo-
tional and illogical appeals will
gain no respect, and will tend to
alienate the FAC'I'ION from those

organizations which have justifi- '

able and defensible grounds for
protest. The FAC'I'ION should
act with a maximum of knowl-
edge and a minimum of passion.

Morally Outraged

To the Editor(Feb. 21)

As a participant in the recent
demonstration against the use of
University facilities by Dow
Chemical for recruitment pur-
poses, I was encouraged by the
number of persons who, evident-
ly, also failed to perceive how
this recruitment relates to the
University as an institution de-
voted to the expansion and dis.
eminatlon of knowledge.

I also agree with those who
were morally outraged atthe sag.
gestion that the recruitment of
persons for assistance in the
operation of an industry that
produces the pain and horror that
Dow Chemical producesis neces-
sary for the maintenance cffree-
dom of inquiry at the University.

There were others who prob-
ably saw the demonstration as a
way to reach an industry which
they felt to be a prime element
in the further brutalieaticn ofa
brutal, immoral war. With these
I also agree and was willing to
sit.
For the most part the demon-
stration was in the spirit of non-
violence. There was even an un-
certain but generally good rap-
port with the security guards.
At this time the demonstration
was effective in making the re-

cruitment process difficult'end
unrewarding enough so that, hope-
fully, Dow Chemical would
eventually be forced to take its
recruitment elsewhere.

Towards the end of my "sit,"
around twothirty, there was
much discussion concerning the
course of action upon the return
of theRccruiter. Thecontroversy
was over whether toremainseat-
ed, making difficult the passage
of the recruiter, or whether to
stand, lock arms and positively
block the passage of the re-
cruiter to his office.

A vote was eventually held and
it was decided to sit. This seem-
ed to me the only logical choice,
for to stand up and lock arms
would have aggravated the aims-
tion to the point where it might
have: precipitated violence and
furthermore would have, it
seems, defeated the purpose of
the demonstration.

If we aggravated a situation that
was already uncertain, knowing
full well that our actions could
precipit'ate violence, then we
would jeopardize our moral posi-
tion as persons concerned with,
and seeking to stop the manu-
facture of violence by Dow
Chemical.

I realize that his moral posi-
tion -— that there exists no such
thing as good violence regardless
of the ends it seeks — is not
held by all.

Furthermore, if we had looked
our arms and refused admission
for the recruiter, the police would
undoubtedly have dispersed the
demonstration, possibly making
arrests —- all of which would
have left Dow free to recruit un-
encumbered.

P.S. (Feb. 22) It seems that
after I. had left the demonstra-
tion for fear of the direction it
was taking, exactly what 1 pre-
dicted would happen, happened.
As a result, from the time of the
arrests until well after five the
recruiter recruited unen-
cumbered.

Why Life Story?

To the Editor:

On February 16, 1968, recipi-
ents of Educational Opportunity
Grants were sent a six-page me-
morandum. The subject of this
memorandum is “Educational
Opportunity Grant Recipient
Questionnaire." The question-
naire contains nine sections:

1) Academic Subject Area

2) Other Sources of Financial

3) Athletics

4) Student Government

5) Social Group Membership

6) Extracurricular Activities

7) Social Life

8) Employment and

9) Use of Student Activities.

I would like to know the rele-
vance of sections I, ll, IV, V,
VI, VII and IX mentioned above
towards the basis upon which an
Educational Opportunity Grant is
awarded. The E.O.G., as far as
I know, is based upon financial
need and not upon a student's
personal life.

I should like to question this
memorandum as to how it will
be interpreted in determining
financial need, what is the basis
for this interpretation and spec-
ifically, who will have access to
this information.

Open Campus?

To the Editor:

"The University is an open
campus and it will continue to be
so . . . Barring recruiters would
interfere with the intellectual
frsedom of and impose a form

of censorship on the University
community." With such state-
ments did the administration
again refbse to deny the use of
university facilities to the Dow
Chemical Corp. recruiters.

Since I was the one to write
the letter requesting that the
University bar Dow from campus,
and lestl be accused of conspir-
ing to subvert the lofty ideals
proclaimed by the administra-
tion, I would like to suggest a
few flaws in the administration’s
argument, asl see then.

In the first place, want is this
“open campus” which we are told
SUNYA is? I would suggest that
a university is “open” only to the
extent that it permits its mem-
bers to freely engage in that
activity for which a university
exists, i.e. academic activity.To
interfere with academic activity
is to “impose a form of censor-
ship on the university commun-
ity," and to the extent that this
is done, a campus may properly
be said to be "closed."

But what has this to do with
Dow Chemical Corp.7 Can the
activity of a Dow recruiter be
in any way construed as "acade-
mic activity?" I contend that it
can not.

The Dow recruiter, as any
recruiter, is here in an economic
capacity; he is here to buy a
product, manpower. What the ad-
ministration’s argument fails to
do is distinguish between econo-
mic activity, which he is patent-
ly not engaging in.

Essentially, what we are left
with then are two distinct types
of "open campus," and the“open-
ness" for recruiters which our
school defends is more properly
termed an "open market;" acon-
cept quite distinct from academic
freedom, or "openess," for
which the university should stand.
To defend a recruiter by raising
the battle cry ofintellectualfree-
dom is to confuse the function
of a fish peddlar with that of a
professor, and is fallacious.

What, then, one may ask, is
wrong, with the “open market”
position advocated by the ad-
ministration with respect to re
cruiters? To answer this, it is
only necessary to ask what our
position would be if this were a
university In Nazi Germany dur-
ing the 19405. If the company
that manufactured gas employed
to murder Jews sent a recruiter
to the campus, our administra.
tion would have to avidly defend
the right of such recruitment
under its "open market con-
cept."

I draw this analogy, not to
suggest that Dow is in the same
moral position as the German
Gas manufacturers, (let each
reader determine that for him-
self), but simply to point up the
untenable position to which the
" open market" concept canlead.
Specifically, the administration
is remsing to even consider the
moral implications of the Dow
recruiter, and it is our position
that these implications must be
considered. The question of the
Dow recruiter must be decided
not by confusing the issue with
that of academic freedom, but
entirely on the morality of ne-
palm. It is Mspalm and its cur-
rent use by our government which
is the real question behind the
Dow recruiters, and any uni-
versity which refuses to address
itself to this question may have
an open market, but also has a
very closed mind.

An Anny Major

To the Editor:

The statement a few weeks ago
by the American Army major who
had toiisavea Vietnamese village
by destroying it" should teach us
something. Military thinking can
actually accept such a horrible
paradox. Unless rational, human
leadership exerts itself once
again Vietnam, and perhaps the
world, can look forward to being

' AN IMMODEST PROPOSAL:

For preventing the children
of college age in these United

‘States from being a burden to
' their society, and for preparing

them to be of great benefit to
the general public:

it is through melancholy eyes
that we survsy the landscape,
follow the press, and conjure
up chimericsl images of events
yet to unfold. Disgruntled stu-
dents inhabiting campuses

v throughout the nation are a fine

case in point. A reputable source
of information contends that in a
selected two-month period last
year, l4,564 students took part
in 71 demonstrations on 62 col-
lege campuses. The Dow Chem-
ical Company, manufacturers of
Napalm, was the favorite target
of the student protestors, ace

   
  
 
       

a. of
counting for 27 of the demoti-
strations. Military recruiters,
the CIA, and the Defense De-
partment tied for second place.
in lieu of recent developments,
it would be safe to assume that
these numbers are increasing in
an inordinate proportion.

Ah, sweet youth, how woefully
you have misconstrued your pur-
pose in these institutions of
higher learning, which comprise
the veritable backbone ofAmeri-
ca. A college education is in-
tended to prepare the youngster
to tackle the evils which beset
him. How will he accept the
responsibility if he wastes his
time pussy-footing around the
door-step of an innocent recruiter
who merely desires to interview
prospective defenders of the
status quo?

Almost everywhere, student

beast.

1 recommend, therefore, that
the students return to their class-
rooms and libraries. Research
into the very topics they defend
might achieve gratifying results.
They might study recent Gallup
polls taken on every continent,
and learn that 90 per cent of
the world is opposed to U.S.
involvement in Vietnam. They
might find the estimates of one
reputable source suggesting that
by January, 1969, the Vietnamese
War will have cost us 100 billion
dollars, 25,000 American dead
and at least 175,000 critically

 

     

  

 

 
 
  

 

 

Muck and Chaff

by Herb Greenblatt

 

 

The overwhelming response
that I received after the first
edition of this column indicates
that there is no student opinion.
With his name, his permission,
and my gratitude, 1 present the
one viewpoint that l DID receive,
that of Adekola Odunede. a stu-
dent here from Nigeria. Adekols
believes non-intervention to be
the best possible foreign policy
for the U.S. This does not mean
isolation. however; Adekols de-
plores American military or po-
litical interference in foreign
nations.

I not only concur, I think that
the U.S. should exert more mili-
tary and political influence within
its OWN borders.

You say that I digress? No,
more likely our government has.
The U.S. has digressed from its
best aims.

Adekola lauds U.S. economic
and educational assistance to for-
eign lands. Adekola cites the
Peace Corps. library grants, and
dried milk and wheat donations
to Nigeria.

Mr. Odunade contends that
America shirks its international
responsibility by inflicting itself
on other nations. 'The world ex-
pects the super-powers, the U.S.
and the U.S.S.R., to be peace-
makers,’ but Adekola sees evi-
dence to the contrary in Vietnam.

Adekola objects to the Ameri-
can presence inVietnam. lie feels
that the U.N. should have been
utilized as peacemaker before
any justifiable invasion of U.S.
"OOPS. My Nigerian friend can’t
see why America must decide

On the other hand, hundreds
of mosques in hundreds of Arab
villages in Israel have disappear-
ed from the surface of the earth.
Some of the mosques in the north

feels that both fighting and ne-
gotiation should be conducted en-
tirely by Vietnamese.

To those who would counter
Adekola with the argument that
infiltration and requests for U.S.
troops constitute a military obli-
gation, I point out that infiltra-
tion by North Vietnamese troops
is commensurate and perhaps
prompted by the increment of
American ‘sdvisors’ in the battle
against the Viet Cong.

Have the watch dogs of the
world become mad dogs? Have
they produced trepidation in-
stead of preventing it?

Adekola doesn't fear a Com-
munist faction in South Vietnam-
ese government. lie favors accel-
ition government which might be
politically shaky, over a present
government with grossly lacking
moral foundations. Adekola feels
that economic conditions may be
more conducive to Communist
methods of resolution than capi-
talist. At any rate, Adekolawants
the Vietnamese, not the Ameri-
cans, to decide the question.

“So many souls have been
lost; now they’re of no use to
America or Vietnam." Adekola
doesn’t say that the U.S. is an
aggressor, but he thinks that
America has failed to meetworld
expectzulcios. The logic of our
involvement in Vietnam is com-
plex, but complexity is not cer-
tainty.

Adekolas views on the Pueblo
incident and national issues will
be presented In later install-
ments. Politically and socially
alert people write to Johnson
Hall, box 326. Why don’t you?

the Garden of the Tomb, in Jeru-
salem was shot in cold blood on
June 7. Today, access to the
interior of the Acss mosque is
denied. the five daily prayers
are forbidden and the call of
the muezzin that has reverbe-
rated for centuries without in-
terruption, has been stifled for
the first time in history.

Mr. Eben has asserted that the
unification of Jerusalem under
Israeli authority would allow the
Arabs who were once inhabitants
of the Israeli side to “inter.
mingle" with the Jewish section.

In fact, Israel's obvious aims
are to dominate the Jordanian
sector both politically and econo-
mically. The Arabs who would
choose to remain in their tradi-
tional home under Israeli super-
vision do not have prospects for
a bright future. But if they tear
themselves away from‘theil’Jeru-
salem they are faced with the
formidable task of starting from
nothing in a foreign land.

There are two distinct aspects
of the Jerusalem problem to
which I would like to call atten-
tion. The question of the Iioly

 

‘ '. A fresh look at politics
might follow the suggestion found
in the “New Republic" that the
young protestors take the
example of distinguished states-
men like Senators Russell Long
or John Stennis, who think all
dissentors should be jailed, or
presidential candidate George
Wallace, who thinks they should
be shot.

They might sharpen their in-
sight through the study of the
Keilog-Briand Peace Pact, or the
Charter of the U.N., and reflect
upon the faithlessness of their
governments in commitments to
the renunciation of war. They
should scan recent headlines:
Dean Rusk assured us of impend-
ing victory over Viet Cong forces.
Five years later, we are still
awaiting impending victory; the
only possible gains we can hope
to achieve at this time is a
victoer the graveyard.

Fur r inspection might un-
cover the demands of the govern-
ment for peace and order at the
precise moment of the Bay of
Pigs invasion, and our interven-
tion in Guatemala and Santa Do-
mingo. From the front page of
Sunday’s New York Times we
cringe to read “recent develop-
ments in S. E. Asia indicate to
most of the world the collapse
of the last possible pretense that
the U.S. war effort might be in
the interest of the South Viet-

ne. se.”
lIrtmmust be noted that students

are, for the most part, untrained
and inexperienced, and have hope-
fully not yet been inculcated with
the morality and perspectives
which have made their elders
the epitome of moderation and
sensitivity.

Therefore, I do propose that
students carefully evaluate the
material which they have studied
and respond with a positive com-
mittment, in the event of another
visit from Dow Chemical Co.,
which might take the form of an
effective rally of 6000mnumber,
instead of a paltry 60.

View From The Behind... (CST/53”"

5. The administration: (a) is
capable of panicking in the face
of adversity; (b) is determined
to prove it is not as liberal as
we thought; (c) needed the pub-
licity from the arrests like they
need a narcotics raid on the fa-
culty lounge; (d) is bending over
backwards to benefit the student
body but has a poor conception
of what the students really want,
therefore wasting much well-in-
tentloned effort.

6. On the other hand, though,
the University is to be praised
for: (a) the President's press
conference — virtually unheard
of on any other campus; (b) an
administration still more liber-
al than most; (6) short lines in
the bookstore this year; (d) a is-
culty and administration that, in
most quarters at least, always
tries hard with good intentions,
even if mistakes are common.

7. Which of the following are
true: (a) the reason girls must
check out swim suits inthe Phys.
Ed Bldg. while boys may wear
their own, is that the attendant
is :1 Voyeur; (b) Headlines for the
ASP are written by an RP] stu-
dent with a grudge; (c) Captions
on ASP pictures are written by
a frustrated editorial writer with
no other release for his im-
murity; (d) if this column ap-
pears in print we will have to
leave town.

8. The snack bar: (a) makes
no effort to find out what the stu-
dents want them to stock; (b) is
wallowing in the comfort of hav-
ing a total monopoly; (c) WAS
well-planned to prevent confu-
sion and mob scenes rather than
orderly lines; (d) stopped serv-
ing lemon with tea when they
found it sold without it.

9. Merger plans for the future
include: (a) Outing Club and Ski
Club will merge for the spring
to find alternate ways to spend
money; (b) YAF & SDs will merge
to protest protesting by unrecog-
nized protesters; (c) local nur-
sery school students will co-oper-

ate with creative students to pro-
duce more handmade clean up
signs in the snack bar; (d) local
kindergarteners will then come
in and show students how to
make a mess and clean up after
themselves.

It’s All Greek

(Cont’d from Pg. 9)
and MYSKANIA, an honorary
body, the only functioning tradi-
tion left is the Greek organiza-
tions.

Using a familiar example, l’m
happy to say that, at the Univer-
sity, Greeks are awakening to the
fact that their existence must be
vital, both to and among them-
selves, and for the University if
their existence is to be relevant
to their situation.

It is hoped that this holds true
for other campus organizations
as well. Greeks have begun and
expanded their vitality with in-
dividual and group services tothe
community, but more important,
with revision of their pledge pro-
grams.

It is a long process, but un-
questionably worth the effort. 1!
a person in a new position has
some idea who! is expected of
him, he can assume that posi-
tion and membership, changing
his actions to fit the needs of a
new situation.

major, campus-wide com-
plaint is "but nobody ever told
me. . . ." If other campus organ-
izations can take a clue from the
University's only functional tra-
dition, fraternities and sorori-
ties, perhaps they can spend some
time at the end of this semester
in joint meetings of old and new
members.

At these meetings the old mem-
bers might explain to the new
what has been done and what is
expected, and perhaps next year
other campus organizations can
shake their aura of lethargy and
confusion and obtain a clearer
perspective in growing with and
meeting the demands of a rapidly
growing University.
