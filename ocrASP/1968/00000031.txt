Monday, March 4 ‘-

Tickets for "The Affairs ofAn-
atole," the third production for
the year by the State University
Theatre, go on sale' Monday,
March 4, at the Campus Center,
but for holders of student tax
cards only. Regular admission
tickets for the play will not go
on sale until Wednesday, March

8.

an eight-day run, March 13-16and
March 20-23, in Richardson 291
with an 3:30 p.m. curtain each
night.

Because of the limited seating
in the Richardson Studio Theatre
(it seats fewer than 100 people

choice of the seats, all of which

"The Affairs oi Anatole" re-
counts the,love life of a turn
of the century Viennese playboy.

dependent scenes, the play has
two continuinf: characters, the
title charactex, Anatole, played
by William Snyder, and Anatol's
friend and confidante, Max, play-
ed by Fredrick Penzel; both ac-
tors appeared in'the December
production of “The Adding Ma-
chine."

The box office for "The Af-
fairs of Anarole" will be at the
Campus Center lnformationDesk
and will be open from 10:00 a.m.

Three Plays Comprise

Union Winter Season

“Robert’s cwn War,"
“Krapp's Last Tape," and "Pic-
nic on the Battlefield" comprise
the public performance of the
Union College Mountebanks for
the 1988 Winter Season. The
plays, which opened on February
29 and will continue through
March 2, feature both new and
familiar faces. The boxcffice is
open daily starting February 26
from 1.5 and from 7-9 p.m.
Telephone reservations may be
made.

Bob Thurber, who has appear-
ed in several Mountebanks pro-
ductions and directed the fall sea-
son presentation of Pinter’s "The
Dumb Waiter" is again acting in
the capacity of director. Thurber
is directing "Krapp's Last
Tape," a short play by Samuel
Beckett. Jeff DeMunn, who has
previously appeared at Union Col.
lege's Nott Memorial Theatre in
l'The Alchemist," "Mistress of
the inn," "Zoo Story," and "Es-
curial," assumes the role of
Krapp in Beckett's play.

The production of "Robert's
Civil War," by Rosenfeld, brings
several new faces to the stage at
Nott Memorial. The play is di-
rected by Mr.Martin Mann,a new
addition to the theatre staff, who
is concurrently serving the thea-
tre department at this university.

by Gary Gelt

Editor’s Desk

 

 

Now that Greek Week and the
Blues Magoos concert of Febru-
ary 16 are a thing of the past,i
feel it is time for an honest eval-
uation of this concert, as it re-
lates to future ones.

After waiting outside of the
Washington Avenue Armory to
see the Magoos for over half an
hour, the crowd was finally ad-
mitted. it then took another half
hour for the concert to begin.
There is really no excuse for
this. Groups are under contract
to appear at a specific time. The
Buffy Saints-Marie concert was
held up over two hours, but in
this case the snow storm provid-
ed a valid excuse. There was no
excuse for the .Blue Magoos.

When the Magoos finally were
ready to-f'perfor-m," the audi-
ence was treated to a not so rare
brand of noise and avery unusual
display of lights and electrical
equipment. in the course of the
Magoos performance they com-
plained about the ii to and mi-
crophone, one of the members
out his eye (he wiped the blood
away with some sort of flowered
shirt), someone In t’Ogroup re.
moved his electrical iacket, and,
occasionally, the group played a

few of their songs.

An incident such as this re-
veals that something must be
done in the scheduling of per-
formers. An entertainer or a
group of entertainers of dubious
quality ought to be seen before
they are hired. Most groups play
the college circuit and often ap-
pear at schools which are not
far from Albany, thus they can
be seen in advance.

A similar incident occurred at
the Winterlude formal this past
December. The comic, who per-
formed at the end of the dance,
had some material of question-
able taste and did not have the
common courtesy to keep his
performance time under anhour.

The success of future concerts
will be severely hampered if a
student stops to consider the last
concert he attended, before he
buys a ticket for another one.
The Seekers or Louis Arm-
strong do not present a problem,
but the good groups which are
not wall known will never re-
ceive the attendance or popular-
ity they deserve, if groups like
the Blue Magoos continueto spoil
everyone's taste for university
concei‘tﬂ.

for the first time in the role of
Robert. Mike Riley is also mak-
ing his first appearance at Union
as Robert's son. Both Roach and
Riley have had previous theatre
experience including summer
stock. Barbara Untracht, a sopho-
more drama major at Albany
State, is assumin the role of
Abbie in “Robert 5 Civil War.’
The cast for this play also in-
cludes Andrew Anderson, Robert
Collins, Stephen Fox, and Steven
Kata. Al Moodie, Mark Watson
and Joel Blumenthal, who are
also included in the cast, have
portrayed roles in "The Dumb
Walter," "The Alchemist," and
"The Mistress of the inn," re-
spectively.

Several members of the cast
of “Robert's Civil War" are also
appearing in Arrabal's "Picnic
on the Battlefield." This group
includes Steven Kate as Zapo,
Andrew Anderson as Zepo, and
Al Moodie as a Corpsman. Thom
Flynn, who has replaced Stephen
Glansrock as M. Tepan, is ap-
pearing for the first time at
Union. Eye Robbins, a part-time
student at Albany State is Mme.
Tepan. Harry Miller is assuming
the role of a Corpsman. Menu
is directing the Arrabal play as
well as “Robert’s Civil War.”

  Won War"

Stars John Lennon

John Lennon's first movie
made without the other three
Beatles, HHowi Won The War,"
is now playing at the Branche
Theatre in Latham. Released
through United Artists, a Trans-
america Company, the unusual
film has been the focus of lively

. controversy both here and in

England, where it had a history
making "mod" premiere.

Set -in World War ii, (and
fanatically set on avoiding World

' War lll), "Howl Won The War"

was produced and directed by
Richard Lester and co-stars Roy
Kinnear, Lee Monatague, Jack
MacGrowan, Michael Hordern,
Jack Hadley, and Karl Michael
Vogler.

Screenplay is by Charles Wood,
based on the popular novel by
Patrick Ryan.

Although the action ofthe story
is set in North Africa, Lester
chose to "shoot" his anti-war
movie where a great deal of real
shooting in real wars has taken
place: Germany and Spain.

Production of the film was a
complex operation. with a
British - German - Spanish crew

As if this didn't cause enough
problems, Lester refused to cir-
culate complete copies of the
script and is quite pleased to
report that none of the actors
knew exactly what was going on
at any time.

Lester’s psychedelic direction

The Ice Capades
Comes To RPI

lce Capades will open Monday,
March 18 at the RPlField House,
Burdett Ave., and Peoples Dr.,
Troy. There will be six evening
and four matinee performances
with the show closing on Sunday,
March 24.

This year the Monday, March
13 performance will be "College
Night at Ice Capades," with a
special reduced rate for parti-
cipating colleges.

Colleges participating in the
plan to date are: The College of
St. Rose, Union College, Siena
College, Hudson Valley, Com-
munity College, Russell Sage
and RPI.

The faculty, administrative
staff and students of the schools
participating in the plan will be
extended a $1.00 discount per
adult ticket. They may also take
advantage of the specialprice for
people 16 years and younger,
which is one half the regular price
of the adult ticket.

Guy Reveil, one half of the
World Professional Champion-
ship pair skating team of Reveil
and Desjardins, stars of ice Ca-
pades, has the distinction of re-
ceiving two medals in the same
events in the 1964 Winter Olym-
pics at innsbruck, Austria.

"1 was teamed with Debbie
Wilkes as Canada’s representa-
tives in the figure skating pairs
competition,” Reveil explained.
"We finished third and received
our bronze medals. A short time
later, after i had become a pro-
fessional with Ice Capades, I
learned that the German pair of
Marika Kilius and Hans-Jurgen
Baumler, winners of second
place, had been disqualified for
signing a professional contract
before the Olympics had ended."

"As a result Debbie and 1 ex-
changed our bronze medals for
the silver ones.“

Reveil and Desjardihs were
brought together as a team after
each had joined the show as a
single performer. When ice Cap
pades closed its 66-07 seasonlast
May, Guy and Gertie hopped ona
transatlantic plane, flew to Lon—
don, and competed in the World
Professional Championships,
held May 26, and walked, or rath-
er skated, off with the title.

Perhaps this title means more
than any other to the skater for
it proclaims him the best in his
field and one just cannot be bet-
ter than that.

New Art Exhibit
At Institute

With the art world aghast at
recent discoveries of fakes and
frauds, the visit to the Albany
institute byJessie McNab Dennis,
Assistant Curator of Western
European Arts at the Metro-
politan Museum of Arts, is most
timely.

Mrs. Dennis came to New York
in 1957, from the Victoria and
Albert Museum, London, and the
Norwich Castle Museum. Her
articles have appeared in “Anti-
ques" magazines, as well as in
the "Metropolitan Museum
Bulletin."

Not the least of her profes-
sional duties is the detective work
involving guarding against for-
geries. Mrs. Dennis' Albany lec-
ture will be on “Fakes, Frauds
and Forgeries," in the deoora.
tive arts. The rich background
of the guest will be supplemented
by color slides from the collec-
tion of the Metropolitan Museum.

James M. Mullen exhibits his
oneman show, “ Prints and Draw-
ings," from February 26 to April
7. Mr. Mullen is Assistant Pro-
fessor of Art at the State Uni-

By now we all should know Bob
Dylan has returned. But what kind
of Dylan -— is it the protestor,
bopper, balladeer, or has he once
again surprised us and changed to
something we haven’t heard?

in his albumJohn Wesley Hard-
ing, Dyland in a sense returns to
his old ways, but it is an older,
more mellow, understanding
Dylan. True, the often dissonant
cocophany is gone, and yet, this
is not the same man who wrote
"Mr. Tamborine Man" or"Boots
of Spanish Leather.” The sur-
realistic nightmarishness of his
tunes is also gone, but they still
retain that personal, interpret as
you will, quality.

Actually, Dylan hasn't dropped
all instrumentation, but these
songs have a more subdued back-
ing with Dylan on guitar, har-
monica, and sometimes piano.
Also included are Charlie McCoy
on bass and Kenny Buttrey on
drums.

lie does return to protest in
"Dear Landlord," but not with
the biting hardness of“Masters
of War.” The song, like“l Pity
the Poor immigrant" and‘i Am A
Lonesome Hobo," kind of pulls
at the heart and often reverses
the role of the villain to add a
deeper dimension.

The title song, “John Wesley
Harding," is about a typical folk-
hero—combination Jesse James
and Robin Hood. He adds a coun-
try and western ﬂavor to both
“l’il Be Your Baby Tonight" and
“Down Along The Cove" with
Pete Drake’s Steel guitar.

Dylan still has not lost his
touch for allusive, metaphysical
lyrics. They are found in all the
songs, but the bestexamples may
be found in “The Wicked
Messenger" and "As i Went
Out One Morning." “The Ballad
of Frankie Lee andJudas Priest"
is the most evidently identifi-
able as "Dylan" in the“liighway
61" tradition.

Generally, the selections on
this album are shorter and less
varied musically than previous
Dylan material. His voice has lost
some of its rasp, but the har-
monica playing remains as usual
—-sometimes on, sometimes off

key.

Some will find it notas imagina-
tive as his other records, but to
Bob Dylan fans it is sheer and
long anticipated joy.

Forget about listening to Wilde
Childc's radio program. All
Superlatives heaped upon WPTR
are hereby rescinded. it seems
that the station's management
could not agree on a non-com-
mercial format and therefore
decided that the services of the
above named disc jockey were
no longer needed. it is a shame
because it might have been one
of the best boosts to popular
music in this area.

The liyrd's most recent re-
lease, The Notorious Byrd

Brothers (Columbia) is quite a
good album. The inconsistency of
quality evident in their last two
releases is gone and replaced by
very solid and beautiful arrange-
ments.

The selections blend into each
other very nicely, giving a feel-
ing of movements instead of in-
dividual tunes. Also, they have
made a limited, but nevertheless
effective, rise of a wide variety
of instruments, most notably
horns and strings.

The record was made during a
period of transition with David
Crosby leaving the group and
Gene Clark returning. Crosby is
definitely on the record, if not
on the cover. while Clarke ls
absent on both record and cover.
it is a shame that Dave has left,
because with this album, the
sound ("Eight Miles High,"
"Mind Gardens") he has been
experimenting with has finally
crystallised. it gives the group a
more mature, relaxed, pleasant-
flowing music. The album will
probably go down noted as the
one with the mostsubtle differen-
tion and nicest sound.

Finally, l'd like to apologize
for not including anything on the
Caffe Lens benefit concert. Due
to my early deadline i won’t be
able to review it until next week.

IF G Screens

This weekend experimental
films make their first appearance
on campus with thelFG's screen-
ing of an assortment of under-
ground films from New York.

The underground cinema move.
ment is characterized by the di.
rectors' freedom from conven-
tional narrative modes and a
freshness of approach rarely
seen in the commericai cinema.

Ken Jacobs' "Little Stabs at
Happiness" is a colorful, poetic
collection of improvised scenes.
“Psyche,” by Gregor Marko-
poulos, is the first of his many
films on Greek themes. George
Kuchar's “Eclipse of the Sun
Virgin" is dedicated " to the
behemoths of yesteryear that
perished in Siberia."

Peter Kubelka’s "Unsere Afri-
karelse" hasbeen called byJonas
Makes “the richest. mostarticu-
late. and most compressed film
i have ever seen." Also on the
program are three recent films
of Stan VanDer Beek:“Summlt,"
"Yet," and "Dance ofthe Looney
Spoons."

in weeks to come the iFG will
be showingShlriey Clarke's‘i'l‘he
Connection," Jonas Mekas""l‘he
Brig," and films by such leading
avant-garde directors as Anger,
Emehwiller, and Brakhage. The
first iFG underground program
will be shown both Friday and
Saturday, at both 7:00 and 9:16
in Draper 340.

seen used to belabor him, but
after "How i Won the War,"
nobody can call him merely that.
He now has an attitude.

But you need more than an
attitude to make a good film,
and this movie is disastrously-
flawed. First, although Lester
is a master of sight gags, here
the gags are mostly repetitious
and silly. To get the alienation
effect he wants — the laughter
which at the peak freezes into
horror — he must give us some-
thing funnier than Michael Craw-
ford falling over backwards for
the sixth time. Lester moves
things along and is never really
boring, but one is aware of a
paucity of comic inventioninboth
script and direction.

Second, as we saw at the end
of “The Knack," the Lester
seriousness is not as tolerable
as the Lester put-on. Much use
is made of characters' speaking
directly to us, but what they say
is often not even ironicei but
downright, embarrassingly
preachy. (John Lennon’s final
monologue is the most irritating
of many instances.)

A more damaging objection is
that Lester has stacked his cards
more than necessary for a good
satiric film. The exaggerated

farcicality of the plot extracts
much of the satire's sting by re-
moving us too much from the
reality of war. The cricket-pitch
gimmick is all so inconsith
and ridiculous that it can't func-
tion as a metaphor for anything,
let alone something as complex"
as modern warfare. ’Lestsr

speaks of"breaking our involve ..

ment;" 1 suggest there is little
there to get us initially involved.

This last problem is partly
compensated for by some affect.
ing performances — Crawford's,
Lennon’s, and especially Roy Kin-
near's. And Lester whisks the
whole show by at such space that
at least two viewings are required
to appreciate all the savage digs
at the British national character,
Churchill, war-film cliches, mili-
tary rhetoric, and the easy waste
of slaughter inbattle. His armory
of cinematic devices in inex-
haustible, his control usually pre-
cise. The trouble is that every
effect is an end in itself, with
little relation to any overall unity:
the whole is less than the sum of
its parts.

i don't want to be unfair. There
are moments that have poignant
immediacy, such as when a hand
suddenly thrusts scrabbling out
of a boxcar in a Nazi railway
yard. And speeches like that of
the platoon's corporal, whenurg-
ed to kill the idiotic lieutenant
—-"You shoot one, you got to
shoot the lot" —- show Lester to
be for once sincere and serious,
and that alone promises much
more from him in the future.
What is unfortunateisthat Lester
could have made a real filmic
“Catch-22" and has wasted his
gifts on a spottin serious "Carry
On" movie.

Antonioni's "L'Adventura"
was for me adisappointment. Not
that it isn't a rich andbesutifully
integrated film or that its meta.-
phors — the lost girl. the island,
the hotels — don't work well, but
the catch was that i just wasn't
made to care. in “Blow-Up" and
"Red Desert” there is an en-
grossing central character cap-
able of being in E. M. Forster's
phrase, “Surprising in convinc-
ing ways" (especially Hemmlngs
photography in "Blow-Up.") But
" L'Adventura” divides our atten-
tion between two pelely-defined
characters, and for all the minute
inspection, they remain remark.-
ablv flat.
