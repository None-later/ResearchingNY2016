lost League I games in Page Gym.

New Paltz, Cobleskill
Dump F rash Hoopsters

by Joel Volinslti

The freshmen hoopsters
dropped to their seasons lowest
form when they lost toNew Paltz,

69-66. Albany managed to lose-

the lead in the last minute of the
game and suffered possibly their
most embarrassing defeat of the
season.

Albany took command of the
game in the first five minutes
and built up a 15 point lead of
24-9. Their shooting was good
and their rebounding exceptional.
However, at this point the tables
turned and it was New Paltz with
the hot hand. The fresh let down
on defense while they couldn't
buy a shot on offense. New Paltz
came back to within seven points
at 29-22. From this point on the
game remained almosteven, with
Albany continually holding a six
point lead.

The freshmen continuedto hold
this six point lead until the final
two minutes of the game. New
Paltz. using a full court press,
came to within one point and took
the lead for the first time with
one one minute remaining.
Albany still could not hit a shot
and failed to get the lead back.
Scoring: Jordan -24. Doyle -12.

DRESS IN FORMAL

Votinski - 12, Smith - 6, New-
mark - 2, McDermott - 2, He-
bert -4, Zaremba - 2.

After this disgrace, it looked
like the season would be all over
for the freshmen. Their spirit
after the game was entirely
broken, but somehow they man-
aged to shake the previous loss
off before the game at Coble-
skill. in the opening minutes,
the fresh played in perhaps the
best form they have all year.
With adequate shooting and eg-
gressive defense, they took a 25-
14 lead against the traditionally
strong Cobleskill club. At this
time, Jim Doyle was slapped
with his third foul, and this af-
fected the rebounding tremend-
ously. At the half, Cobleskill had
come back to take a 32-30 lead.

in the second half, Cobleskiii
gradually built their lead to a
comfortable 15 points with only
three minutes remaining. The
fresh pressed and came towithin
five points, as they have done so
often this year, but they could
not pull it all the way out. The
final score was 74-69.

Scoring: Jordan -25, Smith-11,
Volinski ~12, Newmark -15, He-
bert -2. McDermitt - 4.

which has run its' record
to six wins and no losses.
The entire game was close
as APA led at half time
23-21 as their high scoring for-
VIard Denny Blkin was held to
no points. Not everyone could
be stopped thongh as their fine
offense shifted to meet the ag-
gressive defense being played
against it and Jack sinnott took
charge and scored 16 points.
But the game was won in the
clutch, as Elkln came back to
hit 2 foul shots late in the game
.to put APA in the lead.

The Sig Tau offense was led
by Mike Brennan who bagged 19
points. While their outstanding
defense was led by Larry Meyers
and Dick Woytek.

KB tied Potter for first

The Kappa Beta win over Potter
Club was important because now
these two teams are tied with
identical records of 5 and 1 and
will, barring any upset losses,
meet each other at the end of the
season in a playoff for the divi-
sion title.

the club. They were led in this
fine effort by Dave Goldstein,
who netted 14 points, and by
Howie Dobbs’ clutch foul shoot-
ing, which in the last minute of
play put KB ahead to stay.

Potter showed a well balanced
offense in this game which had
no true scoring leader as a team
effort was displayed.

BILL CLARK HAS BEEN OUTSTANDING THUS FAR.

_ Hera he handles an opponent from Coast Guard Academy.

Clark, Steady Wrestler
Only Senior On Squad

The only senior on this year's
wrestling team is Bill Clark who
has been participating in the 130
and 137 pound weight classes.
Bill, who is a member of Potter
Club, hails originally from Lan-
caster where he wrestled before
coming to Albany. So far this
year, Bill has been the steadiest
wrestler on the.team as he has
built up a record of five wins,
one draw and three losses.

in the first match of the year,
Bill suffered one of his three
losses as he was outpointed by
his opponent in a tight 3-3 con-
test. Following that match, he
proceeded to win lhIsI4-3 four
matches before losing again. Of
these four, be registered one
pin and three decisions. Wrest-
ling in the 137-pound division,
Bill recorded successive vic-
tories against Cortland and Fair-
leigh Dickenson by 9-4 and 6-4
scores respectively. Against
Brooklyn Poly, he obtained his
first pin as he held his opponents

shoulders to the mat at 2:55 in
the match. 8111 followed this pin
with a 5-3 decision over his
opponent from Plattsburgh and
then lost his second match of
the year when he was pinned by
his opponent in 2:16 of thesocond
period.

Following this loss to a Mari-
time opponent, Blll proceeded to
record a decision victory and a
draw before he lost again. In a
match against Potsdam, Bill gain-
ed a 9-2 decision over his
opponent. Bill wrestled in the
l30-pound division against lio-
bart and received a 5-5 draw as
his opponent gained two minutes
riding time and thus was able to
tie him.

When Bill graduates at the end
of this year the wrestling team
will lose a valuable asset not
easily replaced; not only because
he is an excellent wrestler but
also because he is able to hold
his own in either of two weight
classes.

Coost Guard Takes Lead

With the addition of five points
which the Coast Guard received

as a result of Albany forfeiting
the heavyweight class, they con-
sequently had seventeen points
before the Great Danes were
able to score.

In the 123-pound division,Alex
Dumkowski lost a close match
by a score of 4-0. No points were
scored in the first two periods
and Dumkowski lost the match
when his opponent reversed him
and registered two minutes rid-
ing time. Bill Clark, wrestling at
the 130-pound spot, lost to his
opponent by a score of 14-4.
This loss was only the third (1’
the year for Clark who has amass-
ed nineteen points sofar this year
in match competition.

Wrestling at the 137-pound spot
was George llawrylchak,whowas
defeated by his adversary bya
score of 10-5. Fran Weal, who
went on the mats for Albany at
145 was likewise defeated by his
opponent as he gave up six points
while he only scored three.

Springer Only Winner

Craig Springer, who partici-
pated at the 152-pound level,
registered a 4-3 victory over his
opponent. Springer won the close-
ly battled match on two points
riding time. His other two points
both came on escapes as his
opponent was unable to maintain
control over him. In the 160-
pound class, Dave Lambert was
outscored by his opponent by a
score of 9-1. With this victory,
the Coast Guard wrestlers
assured themselves of a victory
in the match.

In the next match, Albany
suffered its only pin of the after-
noon as Marshall Gladstone was
pinned to the mat in 4:00. Roger
Gorham, wrestling at 177, scored
the only remaining points of the
match as he wrestled his opponent
to a 6-6 draw. Gorham also was
able to record the draw as a
result of riding time as he re-
ceived one point for riding his
opponent for more than one
minute. Albany forfeited the
heavyweight division thus giving
Coast Guard a 27-5 victory.

Albany's next home match is
this Saturday as they go up against
Central Connecticut. This match
is the last one of the season for
the Great Danes, and it is hoped
that a good crowd will be on hand
to cheer the grapplers on to vic-
tory in their new home in the
new gymnasium.

F orfeits Hurt Record

The freshmen wrestling team
this year ended their season with
a final record of two wins and
six losses. The team however,
was placed under a heavy handi-
cap as they lacked enough
wrestlers to fill all the weight
classes. Because of this, they
were forced to forfeit three of
the nine positions and fifteen
points. As a result of these for-
feits, the team was effectively
going into each match with a
large obstacle to surmount. To
record even twovictories against
such great odds is a tribute to
those athletes who did wrestle
in the positions for Albany.

wrestling primarily at the 123-
pound spot recorded the most
points for the year as be amass-
ed a total of twenty-one points
with one pin, two forfeits, and
two decisions. Roger Jones
followed Ranalli in total points,
but he recorded the most pins for
the team as he was able to twice
force his opponents shoulders to
the mats for the required time.
Jones also recorded the quickest
pin of the year as he registered
a pin in 3:16.

Dave Jones was the only other
wrestler for the freshmen to
score more than five points as
he was able to obtain a forfeit
victory (or five points, a de-
cision for three, and a draw for
two.
