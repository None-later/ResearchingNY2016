The Albany/State Great Danes are presently'sporting
a 17-3 record, including a 14 game winning streak. This ‘

is the best record of any small college school in the

State, with the exception of NIT bound LIU, and yet the

Great Danes were not awarded an NCAA tournament bid!
The selection committee headed by Max Weber of

Hamilton college did not pass over Albany in favor of

another New York State school that they deemed more
deserving. What they did do was pick a New England
team for the fourth spot in the New York State play-off,
thus blatantly ignoring a‘team.that has not lost since-

December 16.

Instead of Albany the committee choose LeMoyne 12-
6 and Northeastern, presently 13-8. By choosing North-
eastern the committee indicated that it felt that no other
team in New York was worthy ofa bid. If the Great Danes
had been by-passed in favor of another New York State
team, it would have been disappointing and annoying, but
this manuever constitutes an outright insult.

Doctor Werner and "Doc" Sauers have both expressed
their displeasure with the selection of Northeastern, a
move that Sauers termed "provincialism" due to the
predominance of New Englanders' on the selection com-
mittee. How the committee can justify choosing a team
with eight losses over the Great Danes is indeed a
mystery. Northeastern does play a tougher schedule than
we do, but they have lost all 5 of their games with Uni-
verlsity division schools, which gives them a 13-3 record
against College division schools as compared to Albany's
17-2 slate in college competition.

LeMoyne, Rochester, and Buffalo State, the other
schools invited all have at least six losses and none has
more, than fourteen wins. The Great Danes probably do
play a weaker schedule than any of these teams but the
players can hardly be blamed for this. What more can
the team do? A decision like this has to be dishearten-
ing and discouraging. The Great Danes have been working
hard all year, and they have become a strong efficiently
functioning unit that has proved to be more than a match
for most of its opponents. But when it comes to a bid the
committee has said, in effect “come back next year 19-0
or better and we may look at you."

As for the Schedule, this is something that can not be
changed over night. It takes years to build up a really,
tough schedule, and while you are doing it, it seems that
you should take care not- to build your team faster than
your schedule. Sure, we played teams like Harpur, Utica
and Stony Brook, but we destroyed them all. In fact, be-
fore Wednesday night, no one had come within seven points
of the Great Danes since their last lost. Maybe if “Doc”
were not so sportsmanlike, maybe if he just poured in on
and beat teams like New Paltz by forty instead of twenty,
we would be considered, but I would hate to think that

this is the case.

Price’s Rebounding,
Scoring Outstanding

It is rather exceptional for a
6-2 center to be named Most
Valuable Player in his first year
of varsity ball, but then“ Scott
Price is an exceptional basket.-
ball player.

Anyone who has watched Scott
in action can seethat his strength
and superior jumping ability
more than make up for his com-
parative lack of height. Last year
he led the team in rebounding,
and he looks like a sure thing to
repeat in this category this sea-
son. "

Scott's 23 rebounds In one
game, against Plattsburg. attest
to the fact that he can complete-
ly dominate off the boards, but
he is also a steady scorer who
the opposition must concentrate
on. Last year Scott finished
second in team scoring, and his
l7 point per game average will

. surely give him the second spot
again this season. Another posi-
tive attribute that is often over-
looked is Scott's excellent pass-
ing. After the first twelve games
the statistics show Scott leading
in overall assists and in most

assists in a single game.

Scott didn't exactly come to
Albany unannounced, and a quick
look at his past exploits show
that he has been rapidly develop-
ing toward these statistics for
quite some time.

An All conference and All-
Sectional pick in both his junior
and senior years at Clifton
Springs lilgh School. Scott was a
fine college prospect. His initial
choice of schools was Butler
University in Indianapolis, but
after playing freshmen ball there,
he contacted "Doc" Sauers about
lilbany. and soon decided to trans-

er.

So Scott came to the Albany
State varsity well recommended,
and its obvious that he has al-
ready made some really out-
standing contributions. flow-
ever, the thing that probably
pleasesﬂboc” most is the fact
that Scott will be around next
year too, for although it will be
his fifth year_as an undergradu-
ate, it will only be his fourth
year of intercdleslate com-
petition.

As Oneonta Falls by 63-58

The Albany State University cagers’ 14 game w
apparently went for naught as the at
for the Northeastern Region voted
the New York State division tourname

CoachRichard Sauers’ high-powered quintet,

State, 63-58, this past
Wednesday night in the last
home game of the season,
finish their schedule at
Ithaca, Cortland, and Os-

we’go.
he Danes will play at
Ithaca this Friday nightand

then conclude the weekend trip V

at Cortland on Saturday. They
will play a final game at Oswego
State on Tuesday, March 5. This
was a game postponed from earli-
er in the season.

The four teams selected by
the Regional committee are Le-
Moyne whose record is 12-8,
Buffalo State (13-6), the best
school Rochester University
13-6) and Northeastern Univer-
sity with a 13-8 showing.

Although Albany’s won - lose
record ,was the second-best in the
stile, next to undefeated Long»
Island University (the top-ranked
small college in the nation),
Northeastern was picked over
them bv the committee.

Max Weber of Hamilton Col-
lege, chairman of the Regional
selectionsl committee, unof-
ficially gave the reason for
State’s rejection as “weak
scheduling."

The committee consists of the
athletic directors or varsity
coaches of member colleges in
the Northeastern Region. Six of
the eight members are from New
England colleges.

Having found out about the re-
jection just before game time
Wednesday night, the Danesplay-
ed sluggish ball against an equal-
ly sluggish Oneonta State team
before coming from behind to

win.

Oneonta's Dragons went ahead
from the outset and held a 28-23
halftime lead. They lengthened
the margin to 10 points five
minutes into the second half.
From then on the Great Danes,
unable to work effectively against
Oneonta’s tough man-to-man de-
fense to that point, slowly cut
the margin until five points
separated them from the lead with
five minutes to play.

Sparked by the drives of Rich
Margison and the hot outside
shooting of senior Larry Marcus,
the Danes pulled ahead with three
minutes to play and were pulling
away when the final buzzer sound-

edMarcus, in his last homegame
for State scored 12 points. Margi-
son was high for Albany with 22.
Tom Cannistra had 21 for One-
onta.

Margison was recently named
to the weekly All-East squad for
the second time this season.
Averaging better than 22 points
per game, Margison is in strong
contention for the '07-'08 ECAC
All-East team.

Playing their last game for
Albany along with Marcus were
reserve center Tim ('l‘..l,) Jur-
sak and starter Tom Doody. With
ten players returning, the outlook
for next year is more them
optimistic as the three leading
scorers, juniors Rich Margison
and Scott Price, and soph ace
Jack Adams will be back.

U of R to Host Tourney
Buf. State Also Invited

The Northeast Regionals of the
NCAA College Division Tourna-
ment are divided into two divi-
sions, one for New York and
one for New England. Four teams
are chosen f r each division and
the divisions winners then play
to deter mine who will represent
the Northeastern region in the
NCAA tournament at Evansville,
Ill.

The New York State division
tournament will be held March
5 and 6 in Rochester, with the
University of Rochester as the
host team. Also participating will
be Buffalo State, winner of the
SUNYA conference. Teams in-
vited to the New England region-
al thus far include Assumption,
American International Col-
lege, and Bridgeport. All these
teams, with the exception of
Bridgeport, are repeaters from
last year’s tournament. Last
year Long Island University won
the New York State title and the
Northeast Regional and eventu-
ally went on to the finals of the
tournament at Evansville. LIU
could still be in the New York
Regional this year but they are
expected to move on to bigger
and better things, namely the
National Invitational Tournament
in New York City.

Both Buffalo State and the Uni-

vorsity of Rochester have con-
siderably taller teams than Al-
bany and both have played some-
what more ambitious schedules,
but the Great Danes have a con-
siderably batter won - lost rec-
ord than either of the two.

Buffalo state will be coming
into the tournament with a rec-
ord of 13-6, including a perfect
slate in conference competi-
tion. The Orangemen are led
by 6-6 center Charley Davis, a
real jumping jack, and an out-
standing scorer and rebounder.
The forwards also have good
height, as 6-4 Len Piorkowski
and 6-3 Dave Saunders usually
get the nod. The backcourt is
held dowu by a pair of six - foot-
ers, .Iohn Nororyta and Bill
Koslowski.

The University of Rochester
is presently sportinga13-6 slate
They too are led by a big cen-
ter, 6-7 junior Dave Taylor. The
team's high scorers, however,
are 6-3 forward Pierce Baker,
and 6-10 guard Bruce Brown.

M press time the other par-
ticipants were unknown but
chances are that LeMoyne will
also be included. LoMoyne's rec-
ord is now 12-6 and includes
an important win over lthaca,

but also includes a double over- 1

time win over Hamilton, a team
we handled easily.

I ALBANY, NEW YORK .

I (Oath Position
Causes Prof. .
To Lose Job .

by Jill Poanilt
Staff Reporter
James N. Whitney, assistant

professor of Mathematics at the
Uniyersity, was recently informed
that his refusal to sign the
Oath of Office (loyalty oath) has
left no alternative other than
the termination of the illegal
payment of salary to him.

“Young people today," said
Whitney "are growing up in a
world which is unable tosolvethe
most elementary human prob-
lems."

Whitney wrote this in aletter
sent to the Chairman of the Divi-
sion of Science and Mathematics,
Dr. Eugene H. McLarsn. "This
letter," wrote McLaren, “.will
sketch my views on the question
of the loyalty oath."

The signing of the oath of
office is, as Whitney said in
his letter, a legal requirement
for employment at the Univer-
sity, and is therefore required
of all employee.

The Oath of Office states, "I
do solemnly swear (or affirm)
that I will support the Constitu-
tion of the United States of Ameri-
ca and the Constitution of the
Stdte of New York, and thatl
will faithfully discharge, accord-
ing to the best of my ability,
the duties of the position of
——-——— to which I am

now assigned.

"1 know that the oath is alegal
requirement for my job and that
it has recently been upheld by
the 0.5. Supreme Court. My basic
view is that qualifications for any
teaching job do not include any
kind of oath and that an oath re-
quirement is only an attempt at
political intimidation."

In reference to the unsolved
human problems Whitney wrote,
"Indeed, tlxe,,problems are be-
coming more critical every day
and threaten the survival of the
human race.

"In these circumstances many
fearful people foolishly believe
that young people must be pro-
tected from any contact with what
they consider dangerous ideas or
people.

“Unfortunately, people who
have been ‘protected’ from these
dangers seldom learn how to oval-
uate for themselves what the dan-
gers to human survival are.

"If our problems are ever to
be solved they will be solved by
people who have been exposed
to them and can see them for
what they are.

"However innocuous the New
York State loyalty oath may ap-
pear, it gives official sanction
to the policy of the closed mind."

"The circumstances in which
I am being asked to sign the oath
show clearly its use as an in-
strument of politch intimida-
tion.

"I was not asked to sign the
oath when l was hired presumably
because by a clerical error it
was not sent to me. When some
faculty members organised a
draft counseling group working
entirely within the law, a few
Members of the State Legisla-
ture wondered whether some fac-
ulty members had not signed the
loyalty oath.

"President Collins stated pub-
licly that every faculty mem-

Conference Topics,

Sta/l Reporter
At the President's Conference
with sttaienta, Monday, Dr. Clif-
ton B. Thorne, vicopresidentfor
student Affairs, in the absenceof
President Evan R. Collins, dis-
cussed the reduced budget of the

-, University .system and the pro-

posed decor of the Rathskeller.

Thorns pointed out that "Chan-
cellor Gould is disappointed in
the amount budgeted for adminis-
trative funds." Gould is parti-
cularly disappointed in the re-
duced funds available for the
areas of security and aervicesto
titer students.

Central Council Reaffirms Positions
0n Student Protest, Demonstrations

by Vic Looper
Staff Reporter

Central Council overwhelm-
ingly (21-1-3) reaffirmed its Pos-
ition of Protest and Demonstra-
tion, as stated in Central Coun-
cil Bill 6763-46 as adopted onDe-
camber 'I, 1967, at its Thursday,
February 29 meeting.

This reaffirmation, introduc-
ed by President Jeffrey Mishkin,
of their earlier position was the
result of the previous week's
Dow demonstrations. '

Council stated that the nature
of the protest which took place
on February 21, was in direct
violation of its previous position
and the one adopted by the Uni-
versity Council on December 14,
1967.

Council supportpd the action
taken by the University against
those persons who deprived stu-
dents of their “right of free no-
cess to the activities of the in-
stitution without physical inter-
ference, harassment or intimi-
cation."

Council’s Position on Protest
and Demonstration of December
7, 1967 states in partthat“Coun-
cil affirms and supports, the law-
ful right of all students to free-
dom of expression and advocacy
. . . to demonstrate, protest and
dissent, or support and assent in
any manner that does not seek
to deny these same rights to oth-
ers.
“Council states its opposition
to the actions of those who seek
to physically interfere with the
orderly conduct of University
business.”

This position was passed un-
animously. A similar policy was
approved by the University Coun-
cil a week later. The Council's
policy stated that students that
engaged in disruptive actions
could be subject to disciplinary
actions.

Prior to Councils' reaffirms.-
tion, Mlshkin gave a report to
Council as submitted to him by
the Student Affairs Office. The
report stated that the demonstra-

tors becsme progressively more
militant as the day went on.

In the beginning, the demon-
strators merely sat down in the
hall, but by the end of the dem-
onstration they physically block-
ed those being interviewed. Heck-
lers and counter demonstrators
also added to the disturbance.

The demonstration led to ten
civil arrests. A number of 57
students who voluntarily handed
in their ID cards will be consid-
ered before LAAC Judicial Com-
mittee. They will be charged with
violating the recently adopted Un-
iversity Council policy on ob-
structlon.

Council passed a bill to raise
Student Tax $6.75 a semester
from $14.25 to $20 a semester
by a overpowering 22-2-0 ma.-
jority. This bill will have the ef-
fect of raising Student Assess-
ment from $23 io$28.75asemes-
tor for the 1963-69 school year.

The bill originally introduced
by Paul Breslin of Budget Com-
mittee asked for a raise of only
$2 a semester. This was amend-
ed by Sue Chaps to a raise of
$5.75 a semester. The raise will
not take effect until it is approv-
ed by Dr. Clifton C. Thorns, the
Vice President of Student Af-

The reason for the increase
was to help counteract the de-
cline in Student Association rev-
enues, curb the cutinbudgets and
to provide for better andbroader
programming.

The raise will result in enum-
ber of changes in the Student
Tax structure. The raise will be
coupled with very large price dif-
ferentials between SA members
and non SA members. The large
differentials will act as an in-
centive to encourage students to
pay the tax. '

Various services, publications
etc. which non SA members for-
mally received for free will in
the future have to be payed for.
Non SA members may alsobeex-
cluded from various SA financed
activities which they previously
could attend if they paid an ad-
mission price. The Student Tax

policy will also be more vig-
orously enforced due to the raise.

TODAY is THE last day at elections. Polls will close at

there wilibeaneed for 293nm-
tional security officers for the
state University system next

year.

The 81 million Gould is trying
to secure for student services.
will be used for housing, medical
services, registration, and simi-
lar expenses. ‘

Thorne pointed out that this
University spends more per cap-
ita than any other in the state
system for‘student services.

“Chancellor Gould feels
strongly that these services are
important. Furthermore he is

taking the necessary steps togain
more funds," commented
Thorns.

‘ On this campus 59 new posi-
tions in student services were re-
quested, however, only 14 were
recommended in the budget. This
will mean a reduction in servic-
es planned.

Tbese "services were neces-
sary, according to Thorne, be-
cause of the increased enroll-
ment for next year.

A student asked inrolationshlp
to this information, if, perhaps
the University was growing fast-
er than was feasible. 'I‘horne re-
plied, “We want to help as many
young people get a higher educa-
tion in public institutions as pos-
sible." ‘

Thorns revealed that the Uni-
versity has received ideas from
the office of Edward Durell stone
{about the decor of the Rathskel-
or.

In Thorne's words the ideas
are a “cross betweenaEuropean
wine cellar coupled with a rustic
early American decor.”

The decor would include wood
sculpture, barn siding, and a
lighting system conducive to a.
rathskeller atmosphere.

"We think we know how this
transformation can befinanced,"
commented Thorns, "but first
we need the clearance of the
State University architect’s of-
lice."

Once again the question of the
Dow demonstration was discuss-
ed. The LAAC judicial hearings
which have begun this past
Wednesday, will continue untilall
cases are heard.
