2-S Deferments
In Nat. Interest

A student is deferred when
his Selective Service local board
determines the national interest
would best be served by tem-
porarily continuing him in acivii-

tan statue.

Class 11-5 is the classification
given to students attending a col»
lege, university or similar in-
stitution of learning. To qualify
for [1-8, a student must be sails-
factorily pursuing a full-time
course of instruction.

He must request such defer-
ment either on a Selective Serv-
ice System Form 104 or by let-
ter. in either instance, the re-
quest must be in writingandfiled
with his local board.

To be considered as full-time,
a student should have earned 26
per cent of his credits toward
a degree during his first academ-
to year, 50 per cent at the end
of his second year, '15 per cent
at the end of his third your if
enrolled in a 4-year course and
50 per cent each year if in a 5-
year course.

Eligibility for deferment in ll-
5 expires upon attaining a bac-
calaureate degree, reaching the
age of 24, or ceasing to be afull-
time and satisfactory student.

US Balance 0f Payments
Worse After Two Years

(Reprinted from
The New York Times)

by Edwin L. Dale Jr.
WASHINGTON — The most im-
portant thing about the balance
of payments last year is that it
got much worse after two years
in which the payments deficitwas
at moderate levels. Thebigques-
tion for 1968 is how much Presi-
dent Johnson's new package of
measures will improve it.

For the first time, there will
be mandatory controls on direct
corporate investment abroad, in-
cluding an outright freeze tinnew
investment in Western Europe.

Also for the first time there
has been a Presidential appeal to
all Americans to “defer for the
next two years all non-essential
travel outside the Western Hemi-
sphere.”

There will be more pressure
on European countries to offset
the cost oi United States troops,
through purchase ofUnitedStates
arms or United states Treasury

ds.

And there will probably be a
new system of "rebates." for ex-
ports, oi all indirect state and
local taxes, accompanied by an
equivalent new impost on im-
ports.

The President said his package
should improve the balance of
payments by sit-billion in 1968.
That figure is large, but so is the
problem. The deficit in 1967,
though fiscal figures are not yet
calculated, was more than $3.5-
billion, with an enormous deficit
of apparently more than sit-billion
in the fourth quarter alone.

After a period oi calm, the
worsening oi the deficit last year
was an important factor in the
biggest wave of private gold-buy-
im since World War ll.

Some people came to fear that
the deficit would lead to an in-
crease ln the price of gold through
a devaluation of the dollar—
against gold itself or against
foreign currencies, or through a
suspension of gold payments by
the United States.

The nation's gold loss for the
year, with fin figures still to
come, was more than 91-blllion.

Devaluation in any sense re-
mains ruled oui by the Govern-
ment, and the Treasury still had
about ale-billion of gold todeiend
this position.

But when it came to the ques.
tion of attacking the payments
deficit, the Government faced
cruel dilemmas.

The liberties of United States
citizens were at stake to some
degree, not to mention the well-
being and national security of
many foreign countries. But in
the end, the President decided
that first-come, first-served
priority had to be given to the
defense of the dollar and its inter-
national value.

Finsl figures for last year
have yet to be compiled but on

the familiar “liquidity” basis of
measurement. PresidentJohnson
has said the deficit was between
$3.5-billion and sit-billion, or
abOut triple the 91.35-billion
average that prevailed in 1965
and 1966.

What got worse were:

Foreign military expenditures,

because of a further increase in
Asia associated with the war in
Vietnam, though the increase of
about Shoo-million was less than
in 1966.
American foreign travel ex-
penditures with Expo 67 in Men-
treal alone worth about $300-
million.

Bank loans to foreigners,
though they remained well below
the ceiling fixed by the voluntary
program of restraint.

Sales by Britain ofher Govern-
ment-held American stocks and

ends.

Purchases by Americans of
foreign securities.

What got better were:

The trade surplus, as exports
grew a little more than imports
- though the improvement of
about moo-million was much less
than had been heped.

The dollar outflow from cor-
porate direct investment in in-
dustrial countries.

The inflow of income from
past corporate investments.

Foreign purchases of Ameri-
can securities, at least through
the third quarter.

Also, what almost certainly
got worse was the huge catch-all
item called “errors and emis-
sions." Through the first three
quarters the outflow on this ac-
count was already larger than in
all of 1986, and the fourth quarter
plrobably showed a further cut-

arr.

Food Committee

To Experiment
0n Dutch Dining

The Food Service Committee
of the Dutch Quad Board has been
working on an experimental pro-
gram/to better the dining condi-
tions of Dutch Quad.

Committee members Judy
Banks, Laurie Eager, Renate
Hausler, and Mindy Gruenbaum
have solicited comments from
students regarding their prefer-
ence and complaints about pres.
ent meals.

The tabulated reports of the
committee are presented at week-
ly meetings to representatives
of the Dutch Quad kitchen and the
University Food Service. Mr.
Haley, representing the Food
Service and Mr. Clough of the
Dutch Quad kitchen have pledged
to do all that is “humanly pos-
sible” to comply with the re-
quests of the students.

The experimental program for
providing second portions for
students resulted from these so-
lictatfons and meetings.

By cutting down the percent-
age of food wasted, Food Service
will be able to provide extra por-
tions. At present there is ap
proximately $i-3 million in west-
ed food per annum.

Law requires that food, even
if untouched or wrapped, that is
returned on trays must be dis-
posed.

lf the experiment is success—
ful, the policy will be initiated
on a University-wide basis.

Students are requested to take
no more than they can eat, not
to take what they don’t like and to
register complaints with the kit-
chen staff or the representative:
of the Dutch Quad Food Service
Committee.

The Committee has pointed
out that remarks concerning the
food need not be complaints.Sug-
gestlons, for menus and prepar-
ation as well as compliments may
also be given to committccmcm-
bars or kitchen staff.

Choice ’68, College Primary

To Be Held At University

Choice ’68, the National Col-
legiate Presidential Primary, is
planned to be held on this campus
on April 24 and possibly addi-
tional days, if necessary.

The ballot will include a list
of fourteen candidates for the
presidency and three referdum
questions. Two deal with the
country’s current involvement in
Vietnam, and one with the priori-
ties of government spending in
confronting the “urban crisis.”

Candidates for the presidency
ar‘e: Fred Halstead (soc.
Worker), Mark O. Hatfield (Rep.),
Lyndon B. Johnson (Dem.), Ro-
bert F. Kennedy (Dem.), Martin
L. King Cfnd.), John V. Lindsay
(Rep.) Eugene J. McCarthy
(Dem.5, Richard M. Nixon (Rep),
Charles H. Percy (Rep.), Ronald
W. Reagan (Rep), Nelson A.
Rockefeller (Rep.), George W.
Romney (Rep.), Harold E. Stas
sen (Rep.), George C. Wallace
(Amer. lud.).

T11.- hallot is set up so that
the first, second and third choices
for the presidency will be re-
corded. The first choice will be
tabluated for election purposes
and the second and third for
statistical analysis.

The first preposition asks
"What course of military action
should the U.S. pursue in Viet-
nam" with five choices reading
in part: immediate withdrawal,
phased reduction, maintain cur-
rent level, increase, and "All-
out" effort.

Question two concerns the
course U.S. actions should take
in the bombing of North Vietnam
with choices: permanent cessa.
tion, temporary suspension,
maintain current level, intensify,
and use of nuclear weapons.

The third referendum reads:

“1n confronting the ‘urban
crisis’, which of the following
should receive highest priority
in governmental spending: (1)
Education, (2) Job training and
employment opportunities, (3)
housing, (4) income Subsidy, (5)
Riot control and stricter law
enforcement.

The candidacy list and the re-
ferendum questions were pre
paired by the National Student
Directors of Choice. Those pre-
sently concerned with the pri-
mary on this campus are: 13111
Cleveland, co-ordinator; Ro
Cania, Election procedure chair-
man; and Linda Berdan, Public
Relations Director.

" "Titman Form

by Edna Gundersen A

A food committee is being or-
ganized by David Titman, a
senior, in an attempt to improve
the quality and preparation of
the food on State Quadrangle.

Titman has written letters to
President Evan R. Collins, Con-
gressman Daniel Button and
Ralph Nader, who is particularly
interested in the quality of meat
being distributed, informing them
of the food situation here.

President Collins referred his
letter to Dr. Clifton C. Thorne,
vice president for student affairs,
and he and Titman spoke about
the problem. Titman feels that
more conscientious preparation
of the university food is neces-
sary.

students on State Quad have
found meat undercooked or with
too much fat on it, vegetables
that were either over-or under-
cooked, foreign material in the
food, and dirty utensils.

Recently, students have found
pieces of bone inside of sausages.
This was taken to Mr. Fink, the
food purchaser for the Univer-
sity, and the matter is being
looked lnto now.

Individuals have also found
strands of hair caught in some
of the food. Titman has noticed
that the people who work for food
service are not required to wear
any kind of hair net and suggest-
ed that if they were required the
sanitary conditions in the service
of food could be improved.

Thorne suggested that a Food
Committee be organized on State
Quad in conjunction with Quad
Board, where an interested per-
son from each dormitory would
meet with the chef in the Quad-
rangle to discuss the complaints
and suggestions of students re.
garding Food Service.

President’s Conf.

(Continual Iron: Pay/4' I)

This topic caused Theme to
comment, "The greatest flaw in
the student judicial system is
that students are asked to hear
cases on violated rules they did
not make."

That is, a student group is
asked to try a case based on
laws passed by the administra-
tion.

A student then asked, "Why
then do students try cases in-
stead of deans?" Thorne com-
mented "We feel that the student
judiciary system is a valuable
educative device."

Thorne concluded by saying,
“Despite the ﬂaw I would be the
first to defend the student judi-
ciary; they have done a. respon~
sible, mature job."

Lists would be posted in dormi-

comment on. Such a committee
is now being formed and should
be in operation very shortly.

Although some students have
said Food Service has improvad
since last year, Titman is dis-
satisfied with it and sees room
for a great deal of improvement.

He remarked that too often the

tions as they exist and will not
take an active voice in improving
them; the students deserve to
have some influence indetermin-
ing the type of food they are
served and the way in which it is
prepared.

The establishment of the Food
Committee, he hopes, will be-
come a permanent institution that
will continually improve this
aspect of university living. ‘

Freshman School Spirit
Evident on Alumni Quad

by Don Stonlruuoge

Brubacher, Alden, and Water-
bury are the residence halls
which hold the Freshman popula-
tion of Alumni Quad. All three
Hall governments, coordinating
with the Alumni Quad Board,
provide activities for the Fresh-
men not otherwise available on
the Downtown Campus.

Brubscher Hall, being a co-ed
dorm, sponsors for it’s inhabit-
ants such activities as hall
parties on Holidays, Snow Days
at the Mohawk Campus, and All-
Unlversity Mixers and beer
parties.

In the sports field, Brubacher
has sponsored a football team and
currently has three basketball
teams In thelntramural circuit.
Brubacher also publishes a hall
tabloid, "What’s Bru-ing," to
keep It’s residents Informed
about hall projects.

Waterbury, the men's dorm,
also sponsors beer parties and
mixers, but the men are most
effective on the sports Scene.
They fielded a football team in
the Fall, and currently have four
basketball teams, one In each
division, in the Intra‘mural
leagues.

Waterbury chartered a bus to
Ithaca College so Sports fans
could support our Great Danes
on the Court.

Alden Hall is the female sec-
tion of Alumni Quad. These girls
were this year's winners of the
Christmas Holiday Sing. Alden
offers many worthwhile and di-
versified activities for it’s deni-
zone.

The girls can participate in a
First-aid course, a Hall Artshow,
or even receive Bridge instruc-
tions. For recreation, the girls
can look forward to a day trip
to Boston and a Beer party.

In social service. the girls
are sponsoring aChlldren’s Book
drive for the Peace Corp. They
also support 3 Foster Child in
Vietnam.

The Alumni Quad Board is
composed of representatives
from all three Halls. The All-

The segregation of these

Freshmen has instilled a school
spirit in them which is apparent-
ly lacking in the Upperclassmen
of this University.

Polandto Chair
Dept. of Pub. Adm.

Dr. Orville F. Poland, associ-
ate professor of public admin-
istration at the Graduate School
of Public Affairs at the Univer-
sity has been appointed chair-
nan of the department of public
administration.

Poland, who joined the faculty
at the University three years
ago, has served as acting direc-
tor of the public administration
program at the graduate school
for the past year.

Poland’s present research pro-
ject deals with government's use
of computers and the implica-
tions for public administration.

His studies in various fields of
applied economics and public
policy include a mathematical
model of various aspects of the
economy for civil defense pur-
poses, studies on entrepreneur-
ship in underdeveloped coun-
tries, state and local governmen-
tal finances, and a research de-
sign for the Atomic Energy Com-
mission.

Central Council

Council appropriated $1,000
for Music Council to pay for the
Contemporary Chamber Ensem-
ble. The money was allocatedbe-
cause Music Council has already
exceeded their income line and
will probably continue to do so
in the future.

Dave Cummings, the Colonial
Quad representative, stated that
there was a petition being cir-
culated which was originated by
his constituents to try and ob—
tain a longer intercession for
next year.

After considerable discussion,
it was decided to bring up the
topic next week so that Council
could have a copy of the calendar
before them to facilitate debate.

Library Grants

The School of Library Science
at the University has been select-
ed to receive an H.W. Wilson
Foundation Scholarship Grant of
$2,000. The scholarship will be
awarded to a graduate student
in library science.

Each year the foundation
awards scholarships to a few
library schools, a practice start-
ed three years ago. The
reclpients are selected from
among the 38 accredited library
schools in the United States.
