subsequently be eligible for
classification in Class III-A (fa-
therhood) unless he can prove to
the satisfaction (1 his local board
that his induction would create a
hardship to his dependents.

Student deferments are tom-
porary and reviewed at leastonce
a year. A student is classified
,on the basis d the facts in his
individual case. His classifica-
tion may be changed any time his
circumstances change.

College deferments are also
based on reports from the col-
lege. It is the responsibility, d
the individual student to see that
his college supplies these re-
ports to his local board by tho
submission «1 Selective Service
System Form 109 or 109A for un-
dergraduate students and Selec-
tive Service System Form 103
and 103A for registrants in grad-
uate school.

Each time a student is classi-
fied or reclassified he

fore his local board and of ap-
pealing his classification. If at-
tending college sway from home,
he may request that ‘his case be
reviewed by the Appeal Board

in which his college is located.

A college student not in the
ROTC program is classified in
Class US. A college student in
the ROTC program is classified
in Class 1-D. To retain a 1-D
classification, the student must
satisfactorily participate in the
ROTC program.

A full-time college student who
is doing satisfactory work and is
ordered for induction during his
school year, may request and be
classified in Class 1-5 (C) until
the end of his academic year
or until he ceases to satisfac-
torily pursue his course if he
has not previously been classi-
fied in Class 1-8 (C), has not
been classified in Class Il-S af-
ter June 30, 1967 and received his
baccalaureate degree.

Registrants are currently or-
dered by local boards to meet
induction calls from the age group
19 to 28 with the oldest being se-
lected first.

The law authorizes designa-
tion of a prime age group or
groups,but to date no such prime
age group has been designated.

A registrant ingraduate school
may be considered for a student
deferment if he is pursuing a
course of instruction in the heal-

Blum’s Topic
‘Roots Of Art’
At Colloquium

Dr. Harold F. Blum, profes-
sor of biological sciences at the
University, will give a public
lecture, “Roots of Art" in the
University colloquium series, in
the Campus Center Assembly
Hall Monday, March 11, atilp.m.

Blum will discuss the place
of prehistoric art in man's cul-
tural evolution, and some of the
problems as his study presents.
A longtime interest in biologi-
cal evolution led Prof. Blum
some years ago to explore pos-
sible relationships between the
phenomenom of evolution and oi
the second law of thermodynam-
ics. He expressed his ideas on the
subject in a book, "Time’s Ar-
row and Evolution,” which he
is revising for a third edition.

Blum has become concerned
increasingly with theoretical pro-
blems concerning man’s cultural
evolution. That concern, com-
bined with an enjoyment of art,
has brought him to the subject
of his lecture. in pursuit of ad-
ditional understanding he has
visited many sites of prehistoric
art in France and Spain. He
now is making plans for a visit
to more eastern parts of the
Mediterranean.

Public Affairs School Trains

For Public Service Career

by Ira Wolimon

A student Who is interested
in persuing a career in public
service midlt well consider the
Graduate School of Public Affairs
here at the University. Founded
over 20 years ago, the School
Of Public Affairs did not become
a full ﬂedged member of the
University until September, 1966.

Now, under Acting Dean Fred-
erick ’l‘ickner, the School of
Public Affairs is beginning to
function up to capacity. The
School, which grants both Ph.D’s
and M.A.’s, offers courses in
Political Science, Public Affairs,
and Political Economy.

The school aims at students
“interested in entering a career
in Public Administration, govern-
ment, or Higher Education," ac
cording to Tickner. A student
with either a B.A. or a 8.8.
degree may apply for admittance.

Students interested in Political
Science are urged to take under-
graduate courses in that field.
However, in the fields of Public
Affairs and Political Economy,
there are no undergraduate
courses offered, so of course
there is no requirement for stu-
dents wishing to enter the study
of those fields.

At present, there are approx-
imately 250 students (full and
part time) engaged in study at
the School. This includes persons
working on their doctorates in
each of the offered fields.

Many students go on to teach-
ing in higher education after

the cunninauon of their studies
at the school. However, a pro-
portionate amount gointo govern-
ment positions.

Tickner stated that in the com-
ing years the School of Public
Affairs will be working closely
with the other grad schools on
campus—the School of Criminal
Justice and the School of Social
Welfare.

In the planning stages at this
time are two new programs of
study. One is the “legislative
Institute,” which will entail
study, by scholars of the

problems and functions of feder-
al, state, and local legislatures.

The outer program, is the
Center for Comparitive Develop-
ment Studies. It will consist of
studying the development of new,
emerging nations. It is hoped
that both these programs will
be able to open in the coming
semester.

As of this date, there are no
definite plans for expansion of
the student body of the School
of Public Affairs. Currently, ad-
m inistrative headquarters are lo-
cated in Sayles Hall.

Archaeological Program

To Dig

The University, in conjunction
with the New York State Museum
and Science Service, will conduct
a sum mor program in ar-
chaeology at afield station select-
ed by the State Museum.

It will be a seven-week pro-
gram, beginning this summer,
dealing with archaeological
methods and theory in a rich
archaeological zone in upstate
New York.

The program will emphasize
training at the undergraduate
level, but will provide op-
portunities for graduate students
who have had no prior archaeo-
logical field experience.

Six units of credit can be earned
during the seven-week summer
session. No prior archaeological

field experience is expected of
the students, although a back-
ground in anthropology, arch-
aeology, or related disciplines
is a prerequisite for admission
to the program.

Participants will be selected
on the basis of scholarly achieve-
ment and professional motiva-
tion, as documented by a letter
of recommendation from a per-
son famhiar with the applicant’s
academic background.

As for the application proce-
dure, the final date for receipt
of application, recommendation,
and other supportingdatais April
15, 1968. students willbe notified
of decision by April 25.

Approximately 15 students will
be accepteu for the 1968 program.
All inquiries shouldbe addressed
to: Archaeology Field Program
Advisor, Department of Socio-
logy and Anthropology, State Uni-
versity of New York at Albany,

. Albany, New York 12203.

There are four primary objec-
tives in this 1968 Archaeology
Field Program. The first is to
provide practical experience for
beginners in the field ‘ L ‘ .
of archaeology, including excava-
tion, observation and recording,
care of specimens, analysis and
interpretation.

Secondly, it is to provide an
introduction to the theory and
methods of prehistoric arch-
aeology.

The third objective is to
develop a knowledge, both theor-
eticul and factual, of the develop-
ment of prehistoric cultures in
the Eastern Woodlands of the
United states, with special em-
phasis on New York State.

Finally, it is to nilowpructicai
experience, where possible, with
the methods of osteologicai field
research, including the primary
indentificaiion of skeletal ma-
terial.

The professional staff with this
new program include: William A,
Ritchie, state archaeologist of the
New York State Museum and
Science Service; Robert E. Funk
of the Scientist-anthropological
Survey of the New York State
Museum and Science Service; and
Peter S, Miller, instructor of
physical anthropology of the Uni-
versity.

Rivers Proposes
Changes In Draft
Deferments

WASHINGTON (CPS) Horse
Armed Services Committee
Chairman L. Mendel Rivers has
urged two changes that would
make the recent removal ofdraft
deforments easier on graduate
students.

The South Carolina Democrat,
who has a good deal of influence
on military policy, recommends
that 19 year olds be drafted first
and that graduate students, when
drafted, be allowed to finish their
year in school.

Under an order handed down
last week all draft-eligible first-
year graduate students and
graduating seniors except those
in medical and allied fields, will
not be able to get draft defer-
ments for next years.

Since the present order of call

requires the drafting of the old-
est registrants first, the senior.‘

and graduate students will all h
at the top of the draft calls thl
June, unless the order is chang

ed. ‘

Rivers made his recommenda- . -

tions in a letter to Selective
Service Director Lewis Hershey.
in transmitting the order to state
draft directors last Friday, Her-
shey had said that a charge "is
not justified at this time" and
later said that had been" cleared
at the top.”

Rivers noted that the Army,
President Johnson’s draft com-
mission, and Congress had all
agreed that the change in the
order of call should be made.
He added that the President had
said last year he would make
such a change.

"Yet," Rivers continued, "for
reasons that are not quite clear
a decision has been made by the
President either to defer action
on this recommendation or aban-
don ii altogether."

Management Dept.
To Host Institute

The Management Department
of the University will be host to
the Society for Advancement of
Management and the institute of
Management Sciences who will
jointly present a panel discus-
sion, "Managing Creative Peo-
ple," in which the public acade-
mic, and industrial viewpoint will
be explored.

The meeting, to be held in the
Campus Center Assembly Hall,
March 12, 1968, at 8:00 p.m..
will be the second in a series
conducted by and for Research
and Development Executives. The
first meeting last month, was

Earnings ’ Greater

If Student Invests '

College Costs

(CPS) -- A college graduate's
lifetime earnings would often be
greater if he had not continued
in school but placed the cost of
higher education in a savings
bank at five per cent.

That is the conclusion of a
study by Arthur Carol and Sam-
uel Parry, assistant professors
of operations analysis at the
Naval Postgraduate School at
Monterey, California.

uIn some cases," they say,
“it is wiser from the point of
view of investing in an indivi-
dual's labor to have him leave
school earlier and invest his
earnings during the years he
would have been in school, to-
gether with the unused school
expenses, in the capital market."

Using 1980 census earnings
data which cover occupations in-
cluding 49 per cent of all non-
agriculturally employed males,
Carol and Parry found that tool
makers, die makers,and setters,
for instance, can expect greater
lifetime earnings than lawyers
and judges, if the authors' in-
vesting principle is used and
the cost of graduate school are
saved at five per cent.

When the cost of under-
graduate education are added to
those of graduate school, they
found a person would be better
off financially as a plumber than
as a chemist for example.

And when money for graduate
school expenses must beborrow-
ed, the authors found that the
lifetime earnings of many pro-
fessionals are lowered consider-

1y.

"Thus, the family of American
folklore which borrows to send
its sons through medical school
and dental school might be better
advised on financial grounds to
do otherwise," Carol and Parry
say.

Within an occupation, gener-
ally speaking, the authors found
that lifetime earnings usually
increased with more schooling.
But they added that "the changes
in occupational ranking were no-
gligible.”

They also said that "lifetime
earnings are greater for the
man who begins with a blue-
collar job and must switch in
mid-years to a service position,
beginning at the bottom of the
pay scale, than for the man mak-
ing a career in the service posi-
tion."

Carol and Parry say their re-
sults show ihatgovernmenttrain-
ing programs have not always
been preparing people for the
most financially rewarding posi-
tions open to them.

IT IS GETTING to be thof time when the classes are too
long to be endured.

Fall Housing Assignments

Planned At Pan-Hell

by Maggie Diet:

Fall housing assigmnents for
fraternities and sororities were
planned with William McKinnon
and Robert Fairbanks at arecent
Pan-Hellenic meeting.

The general University-re-
quired quota is set at a min-
imum of seven suites, depending
upon the residence hall.

Maintenance of the specific
established minimum quota is
required to ensure exclusive fra-
ternal use and privacy of the
lounge area.

According to the Memorandum
presented by McKinnon, "Each
organiution requesting group
housing must have a sufficient
number of members to meet
and maintain the minimum estab-
lished quota for the residence
hall in which the group is re-
siding.” it is anticipated that
increased occupmcy, especially
of four person suites, for the
1968-1969 academic year.

Special consideration is ex-
tended for newly formed groups.
“We believe group housing will
serve to strengthen anewly form-
ed organization. Therefore, dur-
ing the first two years an or-
ganization has the privilege of
group housing; modifications will
be made in the established group
housing quotas."

A.P. Sloan Fellowship

Received By

Dr. William D. Closson, as-
sociate professor of chemistry
at the University, is among '73
young scientists on the faculties
of 41 universities and colleges
receiving Alfred P. Sloan Foun-
dation fellowships for basic re-
search.

Closson plans to study mech-
anism and theory in the chemis-
try of carbonium ions and or-
ganic anion radicals.

The two-year fellowships carry
an average stipend or $8,750 a
year. The foundation allocates a
$1,400,000 annually for the basic-
research fellowships, which have
been awarded since 1955 through
the foundation's program for
basic research in the physical
sciences. The current group of
Sloan Research Fellows was se-
lected from among some 500
nominations received by thefoun-
dation in the past year.

Last Year Closson received a
$22,833 grant from the Public
Health Service, of the Depart-
ment of Health, Education, and
Welfare, for research in cleav-
age of sulfonyl derivatives with
anion radicals.

A committee of distinguished
senior scientists reviewed the
nominations and advised the foun-
dation on final selections. Capa-
city to do original and creative
research in physics, chemistry.

 

Closson

mathematics, and related sci-
ences is a determining factor in
the selections.

responsible for maintaining its
established minimum quota. This
is generally provided for by the
use of waiting lists; fraternal
housing is maintained by draw-
ing members from other re-
sidence balls or from off campus.

A change in location may be
requested by a fraternity or
sorority. The change can be ap-
proved if both the individual
group and the University are in
agreement.

Fairbanks emphasized thatfra-
ternities and sororities may wish
to sponsor an international stu-
dent in their housing, as some
already do. He said it has been
proven that inclusion of an inter-
national student in organizedfra-
ternal living is an excellent ex-
perience for all concerned.

Maximum quota estimates are
due by Wednesday, March 13.
These should be submitted to
the Housing Office, Room 337
in the Administration Building.

‘Very Nice’,
Dialogue On
RPI Cam us

The lntercolle ate interfaith
Dialogue will present a discus-
sion “Very Nice, Very Nice"
this Sunday, March 10 at 2 p.m.
in the Greens Building at HP!
in Troy.

The discussion will be based
on the contemporary film “Very
Nice, Very Nice." This is the
first time a film will be used
as the basis for discussion.

The Intercollegiate Interfaith
Dialogue group is composed of
college students who have an in-
terest in exploring topics of con-
cern to the college student. The
discussions are broken into small
groups, usually from different
schools, to discuss the topic
which has been substained by
reading of poetry, folk music,
films or other audio-visual aid.

The group meets monthly at
various host schools on Sundays
at 2 p.m. for their discussions.
A social hour follows each die-

The University was a host
school for a dialog: "The Dis-
senter, Asset or Liability to
Society" on February 18. Ap-
proximatelv sixty persons at-
tended the dialogues.

Past dialogues have been con-
cerned with topics such as: “lie-
entry Crisis: The College Stu-
dent Returns Home," “What’s
With the Beat," "The Dissenter:
Asset or Liability to Society,"
and “The Hypocrite: His Role

In the Church and Societv."

aeoaseeaaqcu

A group of girls from .Livlnga-

’ ton Tower passed out a petition,

on Tuesday, March it protesting
the almost nonexistent interses-
sion next year. it reads as
follows:

“We the undersigned students
of the State University of New
York at Albany find it necessary
to appeal directly to the Admin-
istration in order to obtain an
intersession of at least five
school days for the 1968-89 year.
It has come to the attentioncf
the undersigned that Central
Council, a representative body,
has not represented us properly
on the matter ofenintersession.”

The group isprotestingthefact
that intersession will startSatur-
day, January 25 and classes will
begin on Tuesday, January 28.

Thus we will have only one
school day of intersession. Also,
they would like to hold Com-
mencement on Sunday, June 8
rather than Saturday, June 7 and
have the dorms shy open during
intersession.

They feel the petition is nec-
essary because the cutting down
of intersession is so widely un-
known.

Some alternative solutions
have been suggested. One sug-
gests the shortening of vacations
but this would also shorten need-
ed time in other vacations on
the calendar. A second sugges-
tion is to delay second semes-
ter a week but this would make
it harder for students to find
work if the semester ended later.
The most popular suggestion is
to begin school one week earlier
since our first semester usually
begins later than most schools.

The group took the petition
and spoke to Dr. Thorne, Vice-
President for Student Affairs.
He said the calendar was almost
finished but unbound. The bound-
ing of the calendar is being held
up at the moment.

At the last meeting of Central
Council, Dave Cummings, a mem-
ber of Council from Colonial
Quad, brought the issue for dis-

cuuion before Council. Jeffrey
Mishkin introduced a verbal ro-
solution to submit to the Admin-
istration, but it was decided not
to act until the problem hadbeen
investigated further. The de-
creasing of the intersession
length seems to be a trend.
Intersession for the 1986-67 aca;
demic year was Jan. 28 to Feb.

was Jan. 28 to Jan. 30 (4 days).
Next year, the litersoesion will
be cut down to just Jen 25
to Jan. 23 (3 days).
