80 Cent Drink
InPatroon Room

Mixed drinks cost 3.80 in the
Patroon Room. The price oi the
drinks is due to the financial
expenditures oi FSA on equip-
ment and licenses.

FSA paid for all the equipment
and the licenses. $500 was paid
for a restaurant license since
food is served along with the
drinks.

A warehouse license was
needed because there is nospace
in the Campus Center for storage
so the liquor is stored in aware-
house downtown. A trucking ll-
cense was needed for carting the
liquor from the warehouse to
Campus.

Because there is a 4 per cent
tax included in the price of the
drinks it was decided to charge
$.80 instead oi $.75.

Also, with locker storage pro-
vided, an increased personnel
was needed. The Patroon Room
serves one and quarter ounce
shots instead cf the regular one
ounce.

it is possible that once the
operation settles down that prices
might go down but that depends
on how the business works out
since it is new.

Hunter Graduate Fellowships

For Eng. Education Majors

Four two-year government
fellowships for prospective high
school teachers of English have
been awarded to the graduate
division of Hunter College in the
Bronx oi the City University oi
New York for September, 1968.

Up to $2500 a year each for
two years will be awarded to
four college graduates who have
majored in English. They will
study full-time for the Master oi
Arts degree in English.

The fellowships will provide
an unusual opportunity for out-
standing college graduates who
have majored in English to re-
ceive further training in langu-
age and literature before be
ginning to teach.

Part of the future teacher’s
training will include working with
gifted students from disadvantag-
ed areas who have the potential
to attend college but need special
assistance. Such students are
currently enrolled at the Hunter-
Bronx campus under the auspices
of the City University's SEEK
program.

After July 1, l968, Hunter-
Bronx will be an autonomous unit
of the City University and will

have been renamed Herbert H.
Lehman College.
Lehman College will be the

first college oi the City Univer-

sity to receive such a grant from
the Office oi Education of the
US. Dept. oi Health, Education
and Welfare under the govern-
ment's Prospective Teacher
Fellowship Program.

If. Inter4Ame

 

by Jenle Samuel:

An inter-disciplinary Master's
degree program in inter-Ameri-
can Studies that draws from
course offerings in the Depart-
ments of History, Romance
Languages and Literatures,
Economics, Geography andSocio-
logy-Anthropole is no", i'nll‘t 0‘
the graduate curriculum here at
the University.

The aim of the program is to
prepare students who can relate
to other peoples and so contri-
bute to a viable world society.
"To know only the language or
the history, geography, econo-
mics or any other single ele-
ment relating to a country islnot
sufficient." .

A person must have a strong
base of at least one element and
a combination of all the other
elements that go to make up the
personality of the peoples who
inhabit an area," says Dr. Frank
Carrine, Director of the Center
for inter-American Studies.

Presently, the flexible nature
of the program is limited to a
primary focus on Spanish and
Latin American culture and His-
tory. However, courses in Brazil-
ian Portuguese language and
literature as well as concentratr'
ed study in the individual social
sciences are projected for the
near future.

The general aims and objec-
tives of the program are to pre-
pare students for professional
careers in Spanish, history and
various social science areas;
research on topics relevant to
the inter-American area; serv-
ice with government agencies in
the United States and abroad;
and careers with business or
educational organizations engag-
ed in developing, improving, and
promoting the economics and
social life of the inter-American
community.

Those with the followingacade-
mic backgrounds would tend to
be attracted to this masters pro-
gram: students with a majorror
second field sequence in inter-
American Studies whether the
emphasis there is on Spanish
and Latin American culture or
Latin American History; those

students with proficiency i
Spanish and interested in acquir
ing background in Latin Americ .
history and area studies; an
those whose proficiency 1
Spanish or Portuguese is on]
minimal but who have an interes
in the history and related are
courses.

The program in lnter-Ameri
can studies realizes both in
need for knowledge ofadlsciplin
and an effective means of corn
municating that information.

Therefore, a working knowl
edge of either Spanish or Form
guess and an elementary knowl
edge oi the other language is r
quired before the degree can b
awarded.

A major field examination is
an additional prerequisite. A
thesis may be submitted in lieu
of certain courses or as re.
commended.

THE HOMECOMING FLOAT paradafaponaorsd by Special

Events has produced some elaborate ﬂoats.

Attention To Detail
Necessary For Events

In running one of the activi-
ties sponsored by Special Events
Board, whether it be concert,
dance or larger multi-program
activity many details must be
considered. Much behind-the-
scenes work is necessary to com-
plete successfully any such event.

First, scheduling as to date
and time is accomplished through
consulation with the Board and
the Student Activities Office.
Events are usually planned so
as not to conflict with other ma-
jor and similar activities.

Co-chairmen take into account
the University calendar, also,
in order not to schedule a pro-
gram durlng mid-term or final
exam periods.

If the event requires outside
entertainment or off-campus aud-
itorium, these are contracted
far in advance. A program of
this nature is months in the mak-
ing. Problems of cancels,
tion often occur and should be
taken into account.

Arrangement for equipment of
many types from planoes and
lights for staged productions to
extension'cords and tables for
others are reserved or ordered
several weeks in advance, asare
oil-campus auditorium facilities.

Another major area of concern
is publicity and tickets for almost
all events. Posters are printed
usually by outside concerns and
require choices of size, type-
styles for lettering, and wording.

Selling of tickets necessitates
desk-sitting man hours and a
rather large number of workers.
Problems also arise here with
the handling of money and re-
servations and refunds, es-

STATE FAIR WILL again carry a variety

  

pecially when a cancelation re-
quires a change in place of en-
tertalnment.

The large responsibility in-
volved with carrying an event
off properly makes the day of
the activity a 24 hour one for
the co-chairmen. Last minute
changes in plans nearly always
occur and burden for these is on
the co-chairmen.

After an event has been pro-
duced a report to Special Events
Board must be written.

THE ALL UNIVERSITY Talent Show, another annual event,

f Special Events B’oaﬁi‘APP'

Applications for seats on SD06-
ial Events Board may now he
obtained in the Campus Center,
room 18". Au applications must
be received by March 15.

There are thirty seats on the
board open, 24 involve co-ehair-
manships of Special Events and
an additional six are at-large
members.

To be eligible for one of these
seats, a student must have a 2.0
overall cumulative average and
must have paid Student Tax for
this semester. He must plan on
paying Tax for both semesters
next year.

in addition, the prospective
board member must be concerned
with the overall programming of
campus events. Applications are
not for specific activities as in
the past, but for seats on the
board concerned with the planning
of the wide spectrum of annual
University programs.

After receipt of all applica-
tions each individual will receive
notification of a specific time for
interview by the present Board.
The Board considers that these
interviews will provide a better
basis for judgment of the ap-
plicant than would be possible
from the written application
alone.

it also provides opportunity for
the prospective board memberto
indicate in which events he is
interested. in all there aretwelve
different programs needing co-
chairmen.

second weekend ofthe fallsemes-
ter is Activities Day. An in-
troduction for the new student
to campus clubs and activities,

involves coordination of the ef-
forts of a very large number of

Chairman for Ail-University
Minors must be prepared to or-

at various times during the
academic year. Their job
includes contracting for bands
and equipment and arranging for
time, place and theme.

Prospective Homecoming co-
chairmen must have the ability
to coordinate an event which
takes in a wide range of activities,
as must those considering ap-
plication for Campus Chest,Stato

These events include program-
ming of musical groups, novelty
activities and receptions.

The planners at the All-Uni-
versity Reception concern them:
selves mainly with the organiza-
tion of an on-stage talent show.
They must judge prospective en-
tries, arrange ior technical
equipment and attend to other
details involved in a staged pro-
duction.

Chairmen for Winterlude and

sponsible for the contracting d

presentation of a film series.
These films are planned to in-
clude such unusual features as
the original “Frankenstein,”
presented earlier this year.

in addition to the co-chairman-
ship seats, there are six at-
large memberships on the Special
Events Board. The purpose of
these seats is to provide
assistance on any and all of the
regular programs, as well as to
give general ideas andcomments

The Chairman and Treasurer of
the Board must be selected from
these at-large members.

Programs Require
Student Participation

by Jim Small

Each your Special Events
Board sponsors a series of
events, such as mixers, movies,
concerts and fund raising drives.

One category of special event
sponsored by the Baord is that
type which requires direct stu-
dent psrtlclpation for its success.
The upcoming Campus Carnival
is one such event dependent on
student support.

Traditionally, Campus Car-
nival is composed of a week of
sepenrate events which are de-
signed to entertain the student,
and to help raise money to bring
foreign students to the Univer-
sity in the coming academic year.
This year’s Carnival will include
Gentle Thursday, a Mohawk
event, and State Fair, a banner.

Organizing und running Ll’l
event like Campus carnival in-
volves in great deal of work. in
scheduling the event, the co-
chnirmen must first selupntlme
and a place for each part oftheir
event.

Then they have to contact each

of the groups which might be
interested in participating in the
event, and get

u definite com-
mittment from encb group for the

work which they intend to do.

Once all of the interested

groups have contracted to take
one segment of the event, ur-
rangemonts must be made to
supply them with the necessary
facilities to carry out their ob-
llgatlons.

Finally, utter all of the pre-

liminary details have been setup,
all forms of publicity have to be
arranged for; such as boosters,
posters, and various types of
brochures

(depending on the

event). This requires agraat deal
of work, at the same time stay-
ing within a limited working bud-
get.

The appearance of hidden costs
and the lack of internal coopera-
tion are the twobiggest problems
facing the co-chalrmen.

Such things as printing costs
can easily take up one-third of the
budget for a week long event.
in addition, each single event
chairmen must plan his activity
to fit into the larger pattern of
week-long sequence.

Finding students to support an
event, according to past chair-
men, presents difficulities be-
cause communications between
the co-chairmen and the student
body are often faulty if not non-
existent. This results in, atbest,
a misinformed student body.

For those people who enjoy
working on an event without taking
ultimate responsibility, there are
positions available on the com-
mlttees for this year's Campus
Carnival (contact Ruth Sternfield
or Vic Looper).
