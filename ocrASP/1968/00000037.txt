Where Referenda

When organizing an act v ty or group of
any size, it seems necessary to divide the
working force into leaders and followers,
"decision - makers” and "non-decision-
makers." in an ideal situation, the general
“public” has the opportunity to choose the
leaders whom they wish to follow, and,
furthermore, each individual has some
choice in which category he will be.

\Both of these stipulations are true to
a relatively great degree in the case of
Student Association, whose legislative
body, Central Council, is, at least in part,
elected by the S.A. membership from can-
didates who receive placement on the ballot
by a self-nomination procedure.

As with any "representative" governing
body, between elections the legislators
may grow away from their constituency,
losing touch with the concerns of those
they represent. This, we feel. has happen-
ed with this year’s Central Council, not
totally, but certame in part. The S.A.
Constitution provides for referenda for its
amendment, and tradition allows referen-
ds on issues which the Council considers
pertinent to a hearing before the general
S.A. membership.

it is the dual lack of response to the
constituency and the too-wariness ofCoun-
cil as a whole of allowing issues of general
concern to be put before the S.A. member-
ship, to obtain the necessary mandate for
action.

One major case in point is that of recom-
mendations for changes in the proposed
University scheduled for the '68-’69 school
year. Council acted on this matter when
it was first submitted some months ago
after about ‘10 minutes of iess-than-heated
debate. This was a rather short discussion,
we feel, since the schedule allowed an inter-
cession one day shorter than the often-ac-
claimed “too short" time permitted in this
year's calendar.

The matter was brought up again last
week by one Council member who had been
in contact with students circulating a pe-
tition to the administration, indicating in
part that Central Council had not properly
represented them on the question
of the short intercession.

 

Upon hearing this, the body-politic again
discussed the proposed calendar and their
recommendation for change oriack of one,
culminating in a tabiing of the question
until the next meeting when copies of the
calendar would be available. and ignor-
ing the suggestion that a referendum of
student opinion be conducted.

Certainly the wording of such a propo-
sition takes time, in order to formulate

workable alternatives. And it requires
adequate publicity and debate to make
everyone aw..re of the implications of
the alternatives.

The results, however, are worth the
effort. A student body concerned with
an issue is active; if a referendum
were conducted every individual would
have the opportunity to choose between
workable alternatives directly for himself.
And, most important, an active "public"
means a better overall overnment.

Blocked Faces

To prevent the implication of any of
the peaceful Dow demonstrators with the
fracas of that afternoon the faces of the
protesters on page one have been block-
ed out. Perhaps some of the demonstrat-
ors may have wished to have their full
face in the picture to identify them with
their cause.

We feel we cannot comply to their wish-
es for the sake of any individual who was
innocently demonstrating and not in favor
of militant protest tactics. it is this indi-
vidual, who would be unfairly victimized
by a" front page picture, whom we are try-
ing to protect.

People, who are standing in the back-
ground of the picture are, we presume,
merely bystanders and not participants
ofthe demonstration, are also blocked out
because we cannot delineate the protest-
ers from the bystanders.

Compensation

There seems to be a hidden inequity
in room payments for some of the Uni-
versity’s residents. We are speaking in
particular of the students who have been
living on State Quad. They entered un-
finished dorms this fall and suffered such
minor inconveniences as temporary doors,
no lounges, untiled floors and ever pres-
ent sand.

A semester later State Quad residents
have seen a large improvement in their
surroundings. Lounges are finished, the
cafeteria is completed, carpet and tile
have been laid, but the residents on State
Quad must still live, surrounded by con-
struction, and sweep away the sand, which
filters into their rooms.

why should these students pay the same
rate as all other residents when they have
not been afforded the comforts of Dutch,
Colonial, or Alunni? We feel that State
Quad residents should be given a rebate
on their room payments to compensate
for the many hardships and inconveniences
which they are forced, by their situation,
to endure.

Pollution

 

The University prides itself in its young Atmospheric
Sciences Department. This branch of the University
- 15 making a name for itself throughout, the country
and in a few years should be one ofthe best Atmos-
pheric Science Departments in the nation. Among our
faculty in other departments there are several highly

acclaimed conservationists.

Why then does our University add to the mounting
problem of air pollution? The service Building, which
among other things houses the main heating facilities

. of the uptown campus, "can be seen every day sending
out oily smoke to putrefy the surrounding air.

Periodically, what appears as billowing white smoke
also comes from the service area. This is steam,
which does not pollute the air; we are not complain-
ing about this. We are only upset. over the smoke from

the furnaces.

if one takes the short cut back to the Quads from
Stuyvesant Plaza and walks in front of the Service
Building he will smell the problem. The first odor
to hit him is the sweet smell of fresh baked goods.
(Food Service operates its bakery and food storage

in the southern end of the

service area.) if he takes

a few more steps He will receive the impression he is
at the New Jersey gas ﬂats. The smell persists until

he reaches the parking lot.

When the wind is blowing in the right direction,
passengers in cars traveling on the perimeter road are
able to experience the same sensation (except they
miss the smell of baking bread).

Why cannot the University end the pollution caused
by the Service Building? We are sure some filtering
device can be found for the smoke stacks and the oil

smell can be done away with.

To let this condition persist is to let a paradox to
exist. The University is supporting a Department that
is noted for .its studies on the problem of air pollu-

tion (see ASP March 10,

1967) as it is supporting

air pollution. Keep up the good work.

A few nights ago. we went down
to the Strand Theatre to see "non.
nie and Clyde." The movie house
was packed with a viewing sud.
lance of conservative-looking uni
mostly middlesged Albany resi-

dents. V

Just prior to the beginning of
the film, - Bob Hope came
on screen to talk to us about
savings Bonds. There followed
a short variety show with Herb
Alpert, Carolyn Jones and the
Secretary of the Treasury.

The Secretary in turn intro-
duced “from the White House in
our nation's capital, the Presi-
dent of the United states." To
the strains of "Hall totheChief"
appeared our beloved accidental
president, Lyndon B. Johnson.

Upon viewing Johnson's sor-
rowful visage, the audience broke
into hissing, shouting and then
near-hysterical laughter.

This lasted throughout his
short talk and culminated when
Johnson called together all his
long-dormant sincerity to say
that “Savings Bonds are good
for our boys in Vietnam, and,
fellow Americans, they are good
for you." The laughter only ceas.
ed when the feature film began.

This only indicates a great and
drastic change in the attitude of
a good segment of the American
people. When the appearance of
the Commander-in-Chief of the
United States on a motion pic-
ture screen in a city like Albany
is greeted in such a manner, one
realizes that something new is
infusing the American spirit: an
almost European sense of cyni-
cism.

‘Neither the President nor Bob
Hope can cause us to rise from
our seats in homage; we laugh
at the spectacle. This new sophis-
tication can well be called the
legacy of Lyndon B. Johnson.

His Presidency has been so dis-
honest and deceitful that we can
only be left with a strong feeling
of skepticism. Johnson ins taught
this post-U-z generation of our
people that Presidents do lie to
us and that they lie not in the
national interest but in their
own interest.

The average American is more
ready to accept the North Kore-
an version of the Pueblo affair
than the story released by his
own government.

As Murray Kempton has said:
the North Koreans have not con-
sistently mislead us, our own
officials have. The old fashion-
ed patriotism of an earlier year
isgsgrst not adequate in the late

s.

Americans realize that the
storm-trooper Americanism of
the Young Americans for Free-
dom is much less a product of

love of country than of deep-
sested personal neurosis; we
read the incoherent bebblings of
the literature of the new right
wing and we laugh.

Americans are at last com-
ing to realize tint we are not
infallible and tint all is not
right with these United States.

Lyndon B. Johnson is just a
symptom of what is wrong with
America but he is a dangerous
one. Already the young are los-
ing any interest they might have
had in the political process.

Young people are coming over
to the idea that nothing save
revolution can bring this coun-
try back to where it should be.
Even the name of Robert F.
Kennedy is regarded with some
skepticism. We are reconciled
to four more years with John-
son; four more years of deceit
and four more years of abys-
mal mediocrity. We must not
be so resigned.

it looks now as if we might
have a chance to somewhat right
things in 1908. Our last best
hope is Governor Nelson Rocke-
feller. He is not perfect but nei-
ther was John Kennedy in 1960.
He is an expert on foreign af-

The President's National Ad-
visory Commission on Civil Dis-
orders reached the conclusion
last week that the poor riot in
protest against their hopeless
situation. The Commission stat-
ed in a precise and logical way
what the black radicals have
screamed all along: The Negro
is sick of being low-man in a
white society. He wants a de-
cent job and living standard,
like his white neighbors, and
he wants it now.

The real irony of the situa-
tion is that the Federal Govern-
ment can not deliver even the

 

bare essentials. it can not make .

the start toward creating two-
million jobs, revamping the wel-
fare program, bringing six-mil-
lion new and existing dewellings
into reach of the low income fam-
ily, and providing a guaranteed
minimum income. It can not take
these necessary steps because it
will not provide the needed
ingredient: MONEY. With mili-
tary spending at $80 billion for
the fisoal year 1969, and theViet-
nam War adding another $3 bil-
lion per month, the Government
Just doesn’t have the funds.

So how will the Johnson Ad-
ministration answer the cries
of the ghetto-dwelling citizens

Why is there war in Viet Nam?

Every real American should
be able to answer that question
without any dissent. There should
be no bickering over this or that
side cause.

if you would like to know the
answer, perhaps you should ask
frssdman Crispus Attucks. This
Negro former slave was a mem-
ber of the mob which attacked
some British regulars in Bos-
ton in 1770. He was the first
American to die in the fight for
freedom in this country. He knew
the answer.

or perhaps you would prefer
to ask one of the valiantdefend-
ers of the Alamo. They held, in
the last man, in their fight against
tyranny. They knew the answer.

Mli’bo You would rather talk
to all of the men who fought and
died, who lost lives, sight and
limbs, defending our cause in
f a first and second World Wars.

Most of these men were not
ﬁghting communism in particu-

 

lar, they were fighting all types
of tyranny. They were fighting
for the rights of people every-
where; the rlght to think as you
please, the right to listen to who
you want to, the right to feel se-
cure and free. These rights had
to be earned, and they came
dearly. Their cost, in limbs
and lives, has no reckoning.

If we abandon our efforts, in
Vist Nam and elsewhere, we
are betraying a sacred trust,
the trust that all of these men
put in us to keep up the lease
on freedom.

We are not fighting a new
battle, we are jusi picking up
the banner of Justice from the
hands of the fallen heroes of the
past. We are noisupportinga new
cause, we are Just continuing
support for an old one.

Above all, we must not cease
to struggle. We must press for-
ward inielligently, and purchase
new the freedom which should
belong to the people of the world.

lent governor of our state.

He is a man of principle and
this has been his greatest prob-
lem in his quixotic pursuit of
the presidency. ' .

There are those on the left

who say ~that the system is so '

bad that a change in the Admin-
istration can make no real dif-
ference. Perhaps they are right
but I don't see tint we have
any other alternative.

Revolution may sound very Ro-
mantic but it is not the answer.
This is not Cubs; and the Amer-
ican system has served us too
well to be discarded merely be-
cause it is noe in the hands of
the Johnson-military clique.

We can try to bring about a
change in the direction our gov-
ernment is taking by the elec-
tion of Nelson Rockefeller. Rob-
ert F. Kennedy will not run and
Eugene McCarthy cannot win.

We cannot forfeit our destin-
ies to Lyndon Johnson for four
more years merely because we
liberals cannot agree on a can-
didate. The door is now open to
a Nelson Rockefeller candidacy:
do we have any other choice?

is.
who are sick of living in dis-

pair, poverty and frustration?
A good indication appeared in a
New York Times article (Feb-
ruary 16): “Military Stockpiling
Riot Equipment. Airlift to Any
City Planned inSummer." it went
on to say that tear gas, M-‘79
grenade launchers, riﬂes, arm-
ored cars and tanks, are being
strategically located across the
country to meet the expected
trouble this summer. in other
words, the very organization re-
sponsible for the lack of poverty
funds is going to take care of
a social problem in their own
way — by use of force.

A better solution would be to
take the billions given to the
Military and divert it for use
in solving the poverty problem
in America. This plan would ap.
peal to even the skeptic if he
were aware of how wealthy the
Military is. Perhaps facts and
figures would help.

The defense budget for the
fiscal year 1969 will top $110-
billion when the Vietnam War
costs are added. According to the
budget figures released on Jan.
uary 29th, '70 cents out of each
dollar the Government spends is
used to pay for past, present and
future military costs. Only 11
cents is allooated for "educa-
tional and other major social
programs."

In other words, the most pow-
erful economic sector ofihe Gov-
ernment is the Pentagon. in 1952
the U. S. New and World Report
described the economic holdings
of the military as “$200-billion,
which is more than four times
the present book value of all the
plants and equipment of every
0.8. corporation." By 1957 the
Department of Defense owned or
controlled a total of 35-million
acres of land in the United
States. This acreage is greater
than the combined acres othodc
island, Massachusetts, Connecti-
cut, Vermont, New Hampshire,
Delaware, Maryland, and New
Jersey. Remember these figures
are ten to sixteen years old, and
are much higher today.

The Pentagon is also one of
the largest employers in the
country. it has 4,000,000 people
on the payroll, 1,000,000 of them
civilians. if we add the 4,000,.
000 persons employed in defense-
related industries, the figure
jumps to 8,000,000 and that's
more than 10 per cent ofthe labor
force in America. Many of our
cities are almost entirelyldepen.

Pei-taps the most abused
phrase in contemporary use is
academic freedom. For my pur-
poses l have adopted the defini-
tion put forth by the late Prof.
Richard .M. Weaver of the Uni-
versity of Chicago. He said,
"Academic freedom is the free-
dom of scholars and research.

ers to publish the results oftheir
scholarship and teach it with-
out intereference from the insti-
tution itself or. item outside in-
terests." It is the prerogative
of a special group andan earn-
ed prerogative. Academic free-
dom shOuId not be mixed up with
a student's rights in general, for
it is in the nature of the defini-
tion that students cannot right-
fully ciaim its privileges. Stu-
dents are probationers who are
in the process of initiation into
the community of scholars. Yes,
they are seeking truth along with
the faculty but unlike the pro-
fessorate they have not acquired
the skills of scholarship. As
Father Hesbugh, President of
Notre Dame U. has said, “The
student has come to learn and
not teach." This position is ana-

thema to the SDS and Amer-
ican Civil Liberties Union, which
appear to view the South Amer-

 

  

suﬁ ’
ing to recent figures, such cit-
ties as San Diego, Wichita, and
Seattle have economies 60-80pei-
cent defense-based. in addition,
military contracts account for 20-
30 per cent of all manufacturing
in the states of Kansas, Wash-
ington, New Mexico, California,
Connecticut. Alaska, Hawaii and
Virginia.

The military establishment in
this country is plainly an eco-
nomic monolith. ll: gobbles up
most of the Federal budget, and
grows bigger every year. While
the poor agitate for the neces-
sities of life, the Pentagon brass
busily order more nuclear
bombs, fighter-lets, riﬂes, tanks,
armored carriers and all the
other tools ofwarfare. The money
that pays for these weapons
should be channeled into a social
solution for a social problem. The
danger is that the military solu-
tion for all problems —— force-
will be used to solve the problem
of poverty. A reorientation of
priorities is necessary to pre-
vent this catastrophe. After all,
why should ’70 per cent of thetax-
payers money be spent on war and
destruction while the important
problems of society go begging.
The answer is: THEY
SHOULDN’T.

loan Universities sstheidesmiut
for one who underde the his-
torical significance of academic
freedom the distinotlon between
neophyte and scholar is extreme-
ly great. ' ‘

Furthermore, academic free-
dom is a privilegssndnots right.
i exists because the state has
seen fit to bestow upon ihepro-
fessorste a mole] freedom un-
like iint enjoyed by any our
group in society. if is‘ a conces-
sion made to the scholar uskey
member of society. For this
reason, it exists only at the
will of the people.

When one attempts to move
toward an explicit statement of
what conditions would make a
faculty member unfit for teach-
ing, much antagonism and mis-
understanding is encountered.
One may safely say that no one
would feel tint a traitor garb.
ed in an academic gown is im-
mune from legal liability. That

is, to say tint treason can be
no more talented among pro-
fessors iinn among government
employees or military person-
nel. Thus, if a faculty member
is engaged in an activity which
would constitute treason, the
faculty member is criminally
liable. The security of this na-
tion may as easily be under-

mihed in the classroom as in
the Department of Agriculture
or the Douglas Aircraft com-
pany; yet agreement cannot be
reached on requiring the same
degree of loyalty of a professor
as any other government worker.

Liberals will’ argue that a pro-
fessor should not be removed
from his teaching post merely
because of his political associa-
tions. However, we must insist
tint a man's consistent associa-
tion with individuals or groups

actively engaged in subversive
activities is "prima facie” evi-
dence tint he shares their po-
litical beliefs and may move to
implement them. if such asses-
ciations would lose him his job
in the Department of Agriculture
or at the Dow~glass Aircraft plant
it should also cost him his job
at the State University.

From time immemorial, one's
reputation has been determined
in part by the company he keeps.
in employment of officials and
teachers of the school system
the state may very properly in-
quire into the company they
keep. We know of no rule consti-
tutional or otherwise that pre-
vents the state, when determin-
ing the fitness and loyalty of such
persons, from considering the
organizations and persons with
whom they associate.
