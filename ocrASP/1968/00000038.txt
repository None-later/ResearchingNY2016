Pigpens

To the editors:

In his column of 23 February,
Mr. Ray Bertrand, it seems to
me, has gone beyond the humid
of responsible journalism. His
references to hippies as "degen-
erates" who "walk around con-
taminating the campus," their
“pigpens,” the Faculty-Student
Committee's "trash table," and
his final chaotic uninformative
diatribe untinged by anything so
mundane as temperance — all
this strikes me as tastelessness
that ought not to appear in a
responsible newspaper. Let Mr.
Bertrand express any opinion
he likes, but surely nothing is
gained by irrelevant sldeswipes
with a disturbingly nasty tone.

To knowlingly act in such a

Waterbury
To the Editor:

From the timeofthe'i‘ril'lﬂm
Decisratf'm of mo until Presi-
dent Johnson’s speech of May 33;
1937,. official United States
spokesmen have time and In!“
reaffirmed America's committ-
ment to mainteinthe sovereign
independence all! territorial in-
tegrity of ALL states in the
Middle East. This declaratiw.
which has been repeated instate-
meata by fair presidents, obvi—
ously applies not only to isreel
but to the Arab States as well.

These committments havebeen
cited extensively in Congress
since President Johnson's

h. However, the speakers
have (with rare exceptions) used
them' to support the argument
that the United States is "moral-
ly, legally, and politically” com-
mitted to support Israel ALONE.
Even after isreel occupied Arab
territory, the Congressmen fail-
ed to recognise the us. com-
mittment to all the Middle East,
to cite but a few examples:

"The committments of the
United States to uphold and safe-
guard the national territorial in-
tegrity of isreel are clear . . .
We must and do stand ready with
unilateral military assistance in
behalf of the israslis." (Con-
gressman Conte, H6596, June
5, 1967.)

"Morally and legally we are
an ally of Israel. Their cause is
our cause. We are not neutral
in thought, word, or deed."
(Senator Clark, S7749, June 6,
1967.)

"To ask the Israelis now to
give up even a dunim of land they
captured . . . would be grotes-
que. . .." (Congressman Celler,
H6647, June 6, 1967.)

Very few members ofCongress
recognised the past seventeen
years of United States concern
about territorial integrity for all
the Middle East. One in parti-
cular stated:

"if we are going to maintain
the territorial integrity of all
the states out there in the Middle
East, we will possibly have toget
in againstlsreel." (Congressman
Hays, H6712, June 6, 1967.)

The majority of Congress have
shifted position with respect to:
"American Committments," and
this shift is paralleled by smore
subtle, but no less indicative
change on the part of the Admin-
istration. While in his statement
of May 23, 1967, President J ohn-
son explicitly reaffirmed the
American committment to main-
tain territorial integrity in the
Middle East, on June 13, in re-
sponse to adirect question asking
if that committment remained in
force, President Johnson was
blandly evasive in his answer that
the outcome with respect to terri.
toriai boundaries must depend
upon the will of the state con-
cerned.

The failure to reaffirm
previous policy openly and to
implement it diplomatically in-
dicated American unwillingness
to oppose Israeli territorial ag-
grandlzement at the expense of
the Arab States. It is clear that
lsrael's refusal to withdraw is
not only a tactic to secure negotia-
tions but is part of a determina-
tion to retain Arab lands.

Senator Symington stated on
June 1, 1967, that if the United
States allowed Israeli territorial
integrity to be violated, no coun-
try will believe their committ-
ments are worth the paper on
which they are written." In the
face of American aquiescence
toward lsrael's violation of Arab
territorial integrity, his state-
ment aboutthwworth" ofAmerl.
can committments appears all too
appropriate.

To the Editor:

Waterbury Hall Council would
like to Publicly thank Jeff Gold-
farb, one of its former members,
and Larry Blau for their efforts

on behalf of the men ofWaterbur
and of all the students at thz

. University. Because they were

willirg to go to,.aome effort for
us, Food Service has put itself
oit considerably for the entire
University by extendingite Satur-
day breakfast hours. This in-
volves a change in work
schedules, an increase in the
amount of food served, and con-
siderable expense for FSA. We
would also like to thank Mr.
Peter Hailey, assistant director
of Food Service for hia_con-
siderable efforts on.behalf of

Letter To Leue

An open letter to Mr. William
M. Laue:

.i am writing to compliment
you on your excellent "Com-
ment" column in the Feb. 23
issue of the ASP, in which you
protested the drafting of gradu-
ate students. Althoughf also am
a graduating senior subject to
the draft in June, I cannot say
that i completely agree with all
the views expressed in your
article.

Nevertheless, when 1 see the
sincerity of you and the several
other columnists who say the
same things, the very same things
—often verbatim —- lam certain-
ly forced to think. For example,
I am moderately surprised that
such ardent, humane feelings do
not result in continuous draft
card burnings, demonstrations
and violences -— all of which are
surely justifiable if the Ameri-
can atrocities are indeed much
greater than those of the Cong.

Because, 1 therefore sympath-
ise with your position, 1 hope you
will not continue to use certain
phrases which might be mis-
understood by a hostile reader.

Not that you didn't explain with
eminent clarity that you are not
one of those protesters who be
comes concerned at the same
moment that he becomes a col-
lege senior — you were quite
obvious on that point.

But when you appear to object
to "a large dose of cold reality"
entering the lives of those who
have enjoyed a “nice, safe,
middle-class sanctuary of'educap
tion,’ " are you perhaps exposing
yourself to ridicule of both the
non-intellectual and those who, as
i, enjoyed no such "sanctuary"
at home and therefore have never
acquired the tastes to enjoy such
an atmosphere in college?

Although I agree with you con-
cerning the inappropriateness of
complaining about the oppres-
sions of "the black and the poor"
in an article that laments "the
ending of the academic sanctuary
for the economically privileged,"
shouldn't your suggestion to end
all college deferments have been
more forceful?

Finally, what about " those stu-
dents whose backgrounds . . .
impel them to object . . . on
moral grounds" to "letting our
government. . . send somebody
else to die?"

Otherwise, it was a very fine
article — keep up the good workl

Ironic Nature

To the Editors:

How ironic it seems when a
group allegedly intent on a de-
monstration of serious nature
finds it necessary to punctuate
its publicised "cause" with
humor and levlty. In regard tothe
general nature of the recent
campus sit-in against Dow
Chemical, one might indeed use
the old high school newspaper
clich (especially suited to the
character of these demon-
strators), “a good time was had
by all."

Just what purpose is served
by obstructing free passage of
traffic in the halls of any build-
ing on campus? Why should so
small a group be permitted to
hinder the movements of the rest
of the 9,000 students and per-
sonnel of this campus in going
about the business of a univer-

sity? It is very apparent that they
insist it is their right, but it is
likewise apparent that respon-
sibility is of little, if any, con-
cern to them.

it is odd, and in fact it is com-
pletely incongruous that they
claim they must exercise a right
to protest while at the sametime
they are determined to deny the
right of a company to recruit
here and the rights of students to
be interviewed. since they feel it
necessary to dispute the pre-
sence of a corporation which
manufactures a product which,
it is true, can kill, why not then
be consistent and protest against
companies which manufacture
alcohol, drugs, bullets. knives
and care? All of these can kill
just as effectivelyasany military
devices.

Their interest in getting their
picture taken at the right moment,
the use of foul language, and the
raucous atmosphere of the de-
monstration by those students
who obviously found littering the
hall and preventing the use of the
floor for its usual purpose more
worthwhile than going to classes,
prove their lack of regard not
only for the rights of any in-
dividual, but also for their own
supposed reason in being here
at the University. Such in-
dividuals might better profit from
time in class than from fun and
games in the corridors.

Registration

To the Editors:

Until recently, SUNYA was one
of the few universities in exist-
ance that enabled students to re-
gister for courses without any
prejudice against any student re-
gardless of class year or name.

Until, recently, every under-
graduate receiving his advise-
ment through University College
has received an equal chance to
pull cards. Why, all of a sudden,
does our University College
abolish one of the few efficient
systems that it has? ~

Why are we introducing pre-
judice here while the rest of the
country is trying to abolish it?

Propaganda

To the Editor:

Actually, no replyis necessary
to Abdullah's anti-Israel argu-
ment. Any student who’s been
following Arab propaganda real-
izes that it’s at its worst here.
Abdullah’s remarks can’t be con-
sidered as hurtng a single Zion-
ist on campus, because erroneous
data is like a dagger without a
point.

What is annoying is that the
ASP gave back such wide cover-
age to such nonsense. Who is
Abdullah to warrant two pages of
headlines?

Oral Agreement

To the Editor:

Miss Samartino, in her article
about David Schoenbrun (Feb. 16,
1968) stated that the United States
never signed the Geneva Treaty.
Although this is true it must be
pointed out that nocountry signed
a treaty. The 1954 Geneva Accord
was an ORAL agreement. Our
word should be as valid as our

the same hands; one pair sits
N-S, and the other E-W, at
different tables but against the
same team. when the score is
figured, the scores at each table
are compared for each hand and
the total point swing for each
board is converted to IMPs.

To give you an idea of the
conversion scale, in order to
gain 24 lMPs on one board, the
total point swing must be 4000
points or greater (this kind of
swing is very rare, but has
occurred). 600 points, however,
will net you 12 IMPs, and 220
gives you 6. So steady, consis-
tent play is rewarded. At the
same time, there isn't the con-
stant pressure of trying to
squeeze out an overtrick like
there is at boards-match or
match points.

Strategy at IMPs is very in-
teresting. If, for instance, steam
of players of, say, my ability
were to play against, say, the

would be slight (sic) underdogs,
so some special strategy would

 

Every heal y society needs
li-criticlsm. Today in the Us.
9 role of critic is mainly per-
rmed by the academic world,
:1 particularly by the univer-

ties.

Indeed, it is the duty of all
ople who perceive flaws in
ciety to bring these short-
mings to the attention of the
pulses. However, the obliga-
ons of the critic do not end
re.

He must also propose reason-
le, rational alternatives to pre-
nt policies; and then seek their
itiation through peaceful, dem-

ratic process. The socalled

ew Left," which runs the ga-
ut from hard-core Communists
- naive, idealistic flower chil-
en, has largely disregarded
is second duty.

They have been quick to pro-
st, but slow to suggest work-
le improvements. Too often
ey have taken the easy way

i.

Sit-ins, love-ins, stand-ins
c. have taken the place of let-
rs to Congressmen, discus-
on of the problem with approp-
te officials, or simply sup-
rting more favorable candi-
tes in the next election.

The irresponsible protester
v: be placed in three categor-
5. First let’s examine the
Ippie approach. Many of this
pe are sensitive people who
9 deeply concerned with the
equities in our society. In many
stances their protests are leg-
lmate. But rather than working
- ameliorate the flaws, they
ose to ignore them by "drop-
ng out" of society and often
uning in" with drugs.~

They dream of the ideal world,
i refuse to work for it. This
6 of protest is clearly nega-
ve in character. It serves
ly a destructive function. It
-- nothing to improve condi-
ons.

Even more disturbing than
c utopia - minded, do-nothing
ppies are the militant, Red-
iented leftists. The anterna-
yes to present conditions pro-
Eed by this group include the
struction of, rather than the
vision of our society.

In an attempt to legitimize
eli‘ methods, they cloak their
tile with a veil of promised
uality. An example of this type
organization 5 the Socialist
orkers Party (SWP). This con-
omeration of troublemakers,
nks, and Commles is espec-
lly appropriate for this dis-
ssion because it receives
me sympathy and even sup-
rt among students here at the
iversity.
At the recent Dow debacle
was given a SWP campaign '68
mphlet. It proposes the elec-
n of Fred Halstead and Paul
utelle, two men who stand
I" "a socialist America," In

 

content the propaganda shee
denounces nearly every part
of American life. The propos-
ed remedies ior major dilem-
mas are irresponsible to say
the least.

Their solution to the Negro
problem is “freedom by any
means necessary." The descrip-
tion of the Detroit riots clearly
shows the true colors (red) of
this organization. It says, "On
July 23, 1967, black Americans
in the 'model city' of Detroit
rose up against 400 years of
racist oppression and discrim-
lnation.

"In the streets, in the stores
and on the rooftops they ex-
pressed their hatred of the pow-
er and property of white,capital-
ist America." Hypocriticaily,
the SWP vehemently denounces
the violence of war, yet condones
the violence of a race riot.

Finally, we have the type of
protester who teeters between
hippiedom and militancy. Their
kind could be readily observed
sitting on the floor of the Ad-
ministration Building a few
weeks ago. Their solutions to
the problems of the world dis-
play truly infantile mentallties.

Sitting on floors, boycotting
barbershops, and shunning wa-
ter and baths are their answers
to the challenge of the times.
Evidently they think they can
scare the troubles out of life
with their appearance, or drive
them away with their odor. (Does
Dow Chemical make soap?)

We can all envision a better
world. The "New Left” does
not have a monopoly on truth,
beauty or reality as they often
think. Most of us realize that
the ostrich approach of the hip-
pies, the violence of the mill—
tants, and the boycotts and dem-
onstrations of the others will
not solve anything.

Such protest has no positive
value. Only when we workthrough
legitimate legal channelsto make
manifest our ideals are we per-
forming a constructive service
to America.

, .

 

be in order. Since steady play
is not likely to be good enough,
as they will be steadier, an
occasional try for a swing would
be necessary. Today’s hand illu-
strates that strategy.

In a recent IMP match, the
auctions at both tables were the
same, as were the openlngleads.
The hand depends upon bringing
in the diamond suit, sothe declar-
er from the stronger team took
the normal percentage play in
diamonds, cashing the ace and
king. When the queen failed to
appear, he took the heart finesse
and established hearts, ending
two down. +200 for the weaker
team.

At the other table, declarer
from the weaker team decided to
play against the percentages(.Iust
slightly), and try for a swing.

“Oh, my moi's got a hole in it"

It’s All Greek To Me...

by Maggie Diets

 

 

 

Greek ivory towers were con-
structed in 1963 by act of the
University Council. President
Collins' Memorandum to facul-
ty and students concerning fra-
ternities and sororities states
University policy and objectives
concerning fraternal group hous-
ing.

As mentioned before, this pol-
icy was established by the State
University Trustees, in accord-
ance with Section 356 of the
New York State Education Law.
The University Council (at pres-
ent, through the Committee on
Student Government and Organi-
zations) is charged with respons-
ibility "both for the review of
all plans for the ‘appraisal or
lmpmVement of student ac-
tiviiies and housing‘ andfor mak-
ing 'regulations governing the
conduct and behavior of students'
and prescribing for and exer-
cising ‘supervision over student
housing and safety.”

This policy was established
five years ago. It would seem
that an evaluation is in order,
especially by the students in-
volved, The shingles are defi-
nitely flapping in the wind.

First, Greeks must realize
that “any chartered student or-
ganization may apply annually
for group housin

University residence facilities.’
(Report from Greek Workshop
1963) It is obvious that the great-
est strength, unity and communi-
cation is possible only if a group
lives together. This means that
the Biology Club may apply for
group housing; we do have a
co-educational residence hall.

The learning experience of mak-
ing the best of a bad situation
and then trying to do something
constructive with it is the most
important factor in this situa-
tion.

One person who previewed the
picture of the Housing Meeting
commented that it was a great
shot of a class, that it really
showed how students felt around
here. l'd like to ask, if, out
of frustration, we‘re smoking,
snoozing, or just plain SICK.

The housing policy was one of
the most significant changes en-
acted in 1963, seconded only
by the required annual self-eval-
nations.

So what do we DO? The most
important step is that each
fraternity and sorority fill its
housing quota — the maximum
quota if possible. Right now
this is essential to the contin-
ued existence of fraternal groups
on this campus.

Before the Housing Meeting,
1 was told that there would be
an opportunity open to discuss
the future of Greek Housing. This
was communicated to each group.
However, at the beginning of
the meeting, we were told that
this would NOT be discussed.
Perhaps this is the reason for
the looks in the picture, or per-
haps it's a lack of information
all the way around.

Next * year sounds delightful
with “no anticipated increased
occupancy.” But what about 1969
4970? Indian Quad is far he-
hind schedule in construction.
This would indicate future uni-
verssl "tripling"; we're really
going to be breathing down each
others' necks, Lever Brothers'
stocks will certainly be at a
premium.

As We said, this is the time
for a student - initiated evalua-

tion, especially in light of the
fact that the administration-ini-
tiated self - evaluations have
jammed up in their own works.
Based on past experience, it's
time to consider what's going
to happen to our groups.

The Housing Memorandum pro-
vides a two-year consideration
for newly formed groups, so
that they may build up their
membership in order to fill a
section and secure lounge priv-
ileges vital to the nature of
a fraternal group.

it's a perpetual housing com-
ment that the size, hence, in
part the nature of a fraternal
group is forced to depend upon
Edward Durell Stone's archi-
tecture. Well, crew, the build-
ings that are built are built, but
there are millions of dollars
worth more to come. We’re work-
ing under the assumption that
three more complexes compar-
able to this one are yet to be
built. it's time to consider what
sense Greeks are going to make
of this complexity.

The adage that “The only
way to get anything done around
here is to do it yourself" is
already outdated. Now it’s more
like "He who thinks first gets
there.”

In addition to the considera-
tion for small groups, there is
a loophole in the present Hous-
ing Memorandum for groups
whoae membership is greater
than the stated maximum. Such
groups can have their seniors
with housing priority reapply for
university housing by name of
residence hall, rather than un-
der the name of their fraterv
nity or sorority. From the sub-
lime to the ridiculous go we
all, but if our remaining here
is important . . . .

From speaking with Housing
Administrators, it seems that
they don‘t possibly have a defi-
nite picture as of yet. Every-
thing depends upon EDS's ar-
chltecture.

I would say that it's time for
fraternities and sororities to
"think first" if they are to “be
there,”
