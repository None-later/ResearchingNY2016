“The Affairs of,Anatol,_" ‘ writ.
ten in 1693 by Arthur Schnitsier,
a Viennese physician, will open
for an eight day run on Wednes-
rhy, March 13 in a production .
by the State University Theatro.

Directed by Paul Bruce Pet.
tit, who did.last year's produc-
tion of “Lysistrata,” the play
will be performed in the Studio
Theatre, Richardson 291 on the
downtown campus of the Unive -
sity. The curtain will rise at 8: o
p.m. for all nights, Wednesday
thru Saturday March 13-16 and
March 20-23.

Based on an earlier collection
of short stories Schnitsier had
written; the play depicts the af-
fairs of a Viennese "man-
about-town" in a series of seven
scenes, each dealing with a sep-
arate affair.

in every scene, the leading
character is seen with a differ-
ent girl, each evoking a differ-
ent reaction from him. in the
course oi the seven scenes, one
eventually gains a total view oi
Anatol.

Films

You may not know about the
Wednesrhy afternoon film sem-
inar by the Graduate School of
Library Science, but if you are
at all interested in contempo-
rary cinema, it's worth looking
into. The course centers on film
as a communication medium, and
each week a visiting filmmaker
discusses his working methods
and artistic philosophy and
screens some oi his films.

The first seminar featured
Robert Engine, film-book editor
oi Grove Press and director of
uRobert Frost: A Lover's Quar-
rel With The World.” Hughes,
quite a literate man, gave some
precise (and for me saddening)
information on the many com-
promises film production forces
on the director. For instance,
for his excellent "Vladimir Nab-
okov" film, Hughes wanted a
slightly baroque score; but money
ran out and'be was forced to
use nondescript flute Muzak.

Hughes brought some exciting
news, though: Grove Press is
opening a "Great Screenplays"
book line which will include scen-
arios of "La Guerre Est Fin-
ie," “L'Avventura,” “Po.
temkin," "The 400 Blows," “Al-
erander Nevsky," and others-all
copiously illustrated. it will be
an enormous aid to the film stu-
dent to have a fixed text to ex.
amine.

Last week the seminar’s guest
was Donn. A. Pennebaker, one of
the leading exponents oi the cin-
ema-verite style oi documentary
film-making. He is affable, in-
teliigent, and full oi youthful
enthusiasm. Pennebaker hasbeen
responsible for the Living Cam-
era series, Bob Dylan's "Don't
Look Back," Norman Mailer's
"Wild 90,” and an unreleased
film on the Monterey pop fes-
tival.

Cinema-verite is a style oi
film making which stresses the
complete spontaneity and real-
ness of what is Occurring before
the camera. The action is follow-
ed as best the film-maker can-
there is no chance for retakes,
no interference with the action
by the film-maker. Unlike Rob-
ert Flaherty, who would rehearse
and “direct” his subjects, the
cinema-verite man must catch
as catch can. This necessitates
ﬂexible, portable sound and cam-
era equipment; hence the cine.
ma-verite style is most close-
ly associated with the hand-
held camera.

Pennelnker told me, “N be
crazy not to control it (the ma-
terial) as much as i could, but
you can't control it too much
witiiout losing something." That
something Pennebaker is
mood; he wants above all to

recreate the mood oi the ex-
perience. "My job is to be there
. . . and tobring youbacka
report of wtnt is was like to
be there."

Cinema-verite is in a way an
unfortumte label, because no
film-maker can be totally objec-
tive about what he shoots. The
very act of pointing a camera
is a subjective one; the choice
oi angle and composition involves
a process oi artistic selection;
and in the editing oi the film, the
maker’s attitude is impossible
to restrain. Cinemapverite is sig-
nificant because it tries to mini.
mire these elements.

But the c-v's promise - that
real life will necessarily reveal
itsemf with a minimum oi artis-
tic shaping - is not invariably
true. it seems to me tilt cine-
ma-verite is best for a)
the portraiture oi celebrities and
b) the recording oi an exciting
event.

Pennebaker's "Jane" and
"Eddie" fall into the first cate-
gory. Show-bis and political fig-
ures make good cinema-verite
material because they are often
consciously putting on an act;
what can be exciting occurs when
circumstances pierce the masks
and the camera captures their
genuine vulnerability.

Similarly, "Crisis" and "pi-1.
mary" are powerful because the
inherently charged dramatic sit.
uation is heightened by the kin.
etic tension of cinema-verite
techniques. Moreover, such sit-
uations provide a formal frame.

work that unifies c-v's natural
tendency toward the episodic.

Where c-v would fall, 1 think,
is in an attempt to depict a
large scale movement or proceSS
or a pervasive life-style (like
that oi the Samoans Flaherty
shows in "Moana”). Suchthemes
require a degree of controlled

-stylization to make their points;

and the intimate cinema-verite
manner could not submit to such
a broad scale. C-v's realism
and immediacy, barring for-
tuitous incident, are purchased
at the expense of poetry, but
when c-v comes off, it can be
uniquely effective.

Pennebaker provided stimulat.
ing ideas and information and
convinced me oi the value of the
Library School's seminar. in
weeks to come, our campus will
see three such worthies as Stan
VanDerBeck, Jonas Mekas, and,
on March 20, Jean-Luc Godard,
who will bring along his recent
film, “La Chinoise." Godard,
the most controversial director
in cinema today, must not be
missed by anyone interested in
films; and we should be grateful
to the people in cinrge for mak-
ing this event open to the entire
campus.

a1 statement, subjects his title
character to tight scrutiny and
clinical analysis. By making Ana-
tol and his friend Max the only
continuing characters on the play,

the audience views him in differ-
ent situations and environments
gaining a complete picture.

The viewer glimpses the world
oi clurm and frivolity, that let-
surely time prior to World War
1. in spite oi the charm of the
era, according to the play's direc-
tor, Schnitsler's work has the
turd, metallic edge of a nine-
teenthpcentury steel engraving,
underscoring the clinical aspects
of the play.

The cast includes William Sny-
der in the title role of Anatol,
and Frederick Pensel as Max,
Anatol’s close friend. Both act-
ors last appeared in the Decem-
ber production of "The Adding
Machine."

The seven “affairs of Anatol"
are played by Janice Newmark,
Barbara Richards, JoAnn Lad-
man, Ame Murray, Gila Slavin,
Susan Lurie, and Heidi Baird.
Also included in the cast are
Gary Maggie and Thomas Lam-

Fourth Time Around

by Igor Koroluh

 

 

Two weekends ago a couple oi
benefit concerts were held to
raise money to reopen the Cafe
Lena in Saratoga. The coffee
house is one of the best in up.
state New York and in its years
of operation has had some of
the greats in folk music as regu-
lar features. Many people, both
performers and audiences, have
come to love Lena and support
her in presenting the best in
pure folk as was seen in both
benefits.

such noteworthies as LenChan-
dier, Tom Paxton, and the Green-
briar Boys gave their time to
perform for Lena's place. lwent
to the Sunday evening concert
myself. The previous night had
seen Len Chandler plus a back
stage appearance by Bob Dylan.
The thing i was struck with im-
mediately was the warmness of
the audience and the rapport that
the performers were able to
carry on with it. it's a shame that
we don't see this more often,
but in a sense it is something
that is only possible in the folk
world.

Just about everyone was on
Sunday, but three acts made a
big impression on me. First,
in the field of bluegrass, was
the now defunct, and together only
for this concert, Greenbriar
Boys. Albany State's own Neil
Linden joined them with his very
fine banjo. Bluegrass is one of

the few fields of ethnic folk which
still has the ability to generate
both excitement and happiness.
Like jugband it is "good-time”
music.

Second, was a young perform-
er by the name of Michael Coon-
ie. Michael neither writes his own
songs nor sings very well, but
he has been rewarded with an
instrumental virtuosity and a
stage presents which can't
be beat. Once he begins picking
ids 12 string and beaming his
shy boyish smile the audience
is completely his.

Finally, there is Tom Paxton
one of the few brilliant young
writers who has remained in the
pure folk idiom. There are not
enough superlatives to describe
Paxton's brilliance. And fitting-
ly the concert ended with his per-
formance as the crowd shouted
“more, more —."

This last weekend i was for-
tunate enough to be a guest at the
"Aerodrome" on State st. in
Schenectady. The prices are high.
er than most of us are used to,
but they do put on a fantastic
shows. Besides having a very ex-
cellent house band in the Aero-
drome (they can replicate com.
plete album cuts from Sgt. Pep-
per, Maglca Mystery Tour, and
the Vanilla dge).

They usually have and are plan-
ning to have a big name group
every weekend. Scheduled for the
coming weeks are the "Robbs,"
"Left Banks," "Electric
Prunes," and "Yardbirds"
(March 28 only).

1 also had the good fortune
to be able to interview lan Bruce.
Douglas, leader, piano-organist,
and 12 string guitarist for last
week’s feature group, “Ultimate
Spinach."

The group is from Boston,
which is a good place to befrom,
since it is the current rageofthe
record companies to have a Bos-
ton group. They’ve been together
about 10 months and have an
album on GM which was releas-
ed about a month ago.

lan told me that he calls their
music “surrealistic electric"
and that he is aiming for a “far-
out" sound in which a tune will
encompass a whole spectrum of
experience from ugly to beau-
tiful. He said that they draw
upon the "Beatles," "Cream,"
and "Jimmy Hendricks" and ex-
cept for the "Mothers of inven-
tion" have little respect for
American groups, especially Los
Angeles' "plastic" sound.

U. Readers To Present
Two Short Stories

The University Readers will
present a program of two con-
temporary short stories in the
Reader’s Theatre style tonight
and tomorrow, March 8 and 9
at 6 p.m. in the Campus Center
Assembly Hall.

The two stories, "The Walker
through Walls" by Marcel Ayme
and John Cheever's “The Enor-
mous Radio," are described as
an excursion into the fantastic,
a twilight zone type of affair.

Amye “looks at the world from
his own special viewpoint, of
which one characteristic is that
it does not recognise the com-
monly accepted frontier between
the real and the unreal. He has
pushed the frontier farther back,
extending it to encompass not only
life as if looks and happens but
life as it is dreamed."

“The Walker through Walls"
is the comic story of a timid
clerk in the French Government
whose life is changed consider-
ably when he discovers his
strange ability to walk through
walls.

The sordid facts of life are
revealed in "The Enormous
Radio" to a middle class New
York couple when their radio
invades the privacy of numerous
apartments which surround
them.

The peculiar production style
known as Reader's Theatre em-
Phasizes oral interpretation and
sound effects rather than drama.

On Wednesday, March 13, a
month-long series of arts pro-
grams will commence at the Uni-
verslty. The series, entitled
INTERM EDlA '68, is being spon-
sored by the New York State
Council on the Arts. The entire
State University of New York
is participating in this series.

lNTERMEDIA '68 has been de-
signed to accomplish two basic
objectives: to expose a student
audience to new ideas in the
all the arts and to permit better
public exposure of these ideas
and the artists associated with
them.

Responsibility for co-ordina-
tion of the six events scheduled
for the University has been de-
legated to co-chairmen Christine
Sternberg and Marti Stroemi of
the Community Programming
Commission.

Performing at 8 p.m. in the
Campus Center Ballroom, in the
initial event of this arts festi-
val, will be composer, author,
and publisher Dick Higgins. Born
March 15, 1938 in Cambridge,
England, Higgins passed his
childhood in Massachusetts, Ver-
mont, and New Hampshire. He
composed his first music at the
age of six and wrote his first
plays when nine.

In 1957, Higgins withdrewirom
Yale University (he was to gradu-
ate from Columbia in 1060) and,
in his own words, "fled to New
York." "l'hcl'e he studied com-
position with revolutionary com.
posers John Cage and Henry
Coweii and met Alison Knowles,
whom he was eventually to marry.

Higgins, himself, has listed
in detail his entire artistic out-
put: “eariy happenings and
fluxus," among them "27 Epi-
sodes for Aquariun ’I‘heater"
0067); "Stacked Deck" 0056),
the first “suspension play" and,
also, the first “electronic
opera."

first of eleven scheduled per-
formances of "The Fantasticks"
in the Campus Center Ballroom.

Subtitled “A Parable About
Laws};n thighd play creates a
c arm g magical glimpse
into the fairyland of two young
people falling in love.Wlut might
at first glance appear to be a
rather sillyandsentirnental story
proved to be a most lively and
entertaining evening as a result
of the great spirit and vivacity
of the entire cast.

The first act relates the court-
ing and winning of the girl over
such minor obstacles as their
parents feigned disapproval, a
mock rape, and a great sword
fight. Beautifully performed by
all, this act gets the play off
to a great start. Mary Carney
as the girl and Gary Restifo
as the boy proved a charming
couple.

Their great enthusiasm and en-
ergy make their performance in
this act dynamic despite their
rather untrained and underdevel-
oped singing ability.

Both John Webb and Edward
G. Spence do anadequateiy amus-
ing job as the fathers and
Charles Bartlett cuts adsshing
figure as both the narrator and
the bandit.

it is unfortunate, however, that
after this excellent start the
second act does not live up to
expectations. The main failure
here seems to lie with the prin-
clpies.

This act shows how the couple,
separated, and having experienc-
ed the cruel world, return to each
other with a greater and wiser
love. Unfortunately, both Miss
Carney and Mr. Restifo prove
one dimensional.

We cannot possiblybelieve that
the boy at the end of the
play has had wordlyv experiences
