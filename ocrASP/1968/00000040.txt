AMIA‘ BASKETBALL MOVED INTO THE new gym last

week allowing two games of 0 time, for a while anyway.

Three Varsity Sports,
Three Clubs In Spring

This spring Albany State sports
will take on an added dimension,
with the addition of two new club
sports, and the expansion of
another. Even without these new
sports, (Sailing, Lacrosse and
Track and Field) the spring
schedule would be more exten-
sive than either the fallor winter
schedules, as three varsity teams
will be returning to action in
mid April.

The Baseball team, under the
direction oi coach Burlingame,
will be facing an eighteen game
schedule, but with most oi last
years team returning a mildly
optimistic outlook seems to be
justified.

The tennis team will onceagain
be under the direction of coach
Hathaway, and it too has a good
number of returning lettermen.
The team will be playing a ten
match schedule, with most of the
opposition provided by other state
schools, so here too optimism
seems justifiable.

Varsity golf will be under the
direction of coach Sauers again.
With several of the top men
returning they too have a good
nucleus from which to build.
Thus a general overview of the
varsity level sports indicates
that all teams seem to have the
potential for 500 seasons or
better.

on the clublevel, the track club
is being expanded into a track

and field club. Coacn Munsey
will again be handling the track
events again, while coach Kel-
ly will be directing the field
events. The clubs schedule still
is not set, but with strength In
the longer track events, and one
or two good men in most of the
field events, they should make a
respectible showing.

The newly formed lacrosse
club is tentatively scheduled for
two games each with the Siena
frosh and with Coblesklll
Adt'l‘, and for one game with the
Union frosh. Weekend games
with the Tricity Lacrosse Club
are also planned. Coach Silvey
has ab0ut thirty men out for the
squad, and quite a few have some
high school experience.

Another new club is the sail-
ing club. Sailing is one of the
few co-ed sports, and coach
Hemenway has also had a pretty
good turnout. The sailing club
will be practicing at the Mo-
hawk campus, and they are sched-
uled to take part in four regat-
tas, including the Associate Mem-
ber Championships on March 4
at Princeton, New Jersey.

Another innovation this spring
will be spring soccer, as many
of last falls varsity and fresh-
men soccer players will be work-
ing out regularly, and the team
will be playing several practice
games with neighboring schools.

Swimmers Fall 74-30
Flood Takes 100 Free

The Albany State men's swim
club competed in its second meet
of the season last week, as they
traveled to Harpur, to take on a
long established swim team.

The outcome was never in doubt
as the larger more experienced
Harpur squad jumped into an
early lead, and were never head-
ed, winning 74-30. However, most
of the Albany swimmers turned
in their besttimes ever and coach
Kelley was pleased with the
team's overall showing,

Craig Flood was the only
winner for Albany as he covered
the 100 yard free-style in 100.4.
Flood also recorded athird place
finish in the 200-yard free style.
Jon Gethehead also turned in a
(the effort as scored seconds in
the 00-yard free and the 500-
yard free.

Russell Goats also placed in
two events, taking a secondinthe
100 free, and a third in the 50
free, while Potc Pavone scored
a second in the 100 yard butter-

fly and a third in the 200-yard
breaststroke. Pete Klara also
turned in a fine performance, as
he took second in diving in his
first match.

The varsity wrestling team finished its'season' this past week on a losing note as they

dropped matches on Tuesday and Saturday. The 'grapplera were defeated on Tuesday
night by Montcleir by a score of 27-6. On Saturday, they again tallied only six points
as they lost to Central Connecticut by a score of 30-6. Craig Springer was the only
wrestler't‘or Albany who was able to post two wins in the matches. .

in both matches, the Great Danes were handicapped by the fact that they were for-

ners for Albany. Alex Dom-
skowski, wrestling 4! the 123-
pound division, was defeated by
his opponent by an 8-0 score.
Bill Clark, who was participating
at the loo-pound spot also lost
as he was outscored by his op-
ponent by 9-3. George Hawryl-
chak then recorded Albany's
first three points when he ob-
tained a 12-5 decision over his
opponent in the l37-pound divi-
sion. Fran Weal nearly evened
the score as he wrestled his op-
ponent to a close 8-7 decision.
in the 152-pound division, Craig
Springer received the final three
points for Albany when he wres-
tled his opponent to a 6-4 deci-
sion. The grapplers then lost
the next four weight classes and
the match.

Dave Lambert was defeated by
a 16-2 score in the 160.- pound
division, Marshall Gladstonewas
pinned in the 167-pound division
in 5:30, and the next two po-
sltlons were forefeited and as
a result the final score read
Montclair 27, Albany 6.

Albany's next encounter was
no more successful than their
match with Montclair as they
again scored only six points.
Blll Clark at 130 pounds and
Craig Springer at 152 pounds
were the only wituiers for the
Great Danes.

Alex Domkowski was again de-
feated in the 123 pound deci-
sion by a pin in 6:25. in the
130 pound division. Bill Clark
recorded three points for Al-
bany as he tallied a 13-6 vic-
tory over his opponent. George
Hawrylchak, who was one of the
only winners in Tuesday's match
lost in the 137 pound division
as he was pinned in 8:40. Fran
Weal suffered his second loss
of the week when he was pinned
at 1:48 of the first period. Craig
Springer then recorded his sec-
ond victory for the week when
he obtained a 5-3 victory over
his opponent.

in the 160 pound division,Dave
Lambert was pinned by his op-
ponent after 4:59 seconds of
wrestling. Marshall Gladstone,
at the 167 pound spot, also suf-
fered a pin when his shoulders
were forced to the mat by his
opponent at 1:28 of the third
period. Both schools forfeited
the 177 pound division and Al-
bany once again forfeitedthe hea-
vyweight division thus making
the final score Central Connec-
ticut :10, Albanyo.

As a result of these two loss-
es, Albany ended its season with
a record of one win and 10 loss-
es with a second place in their
quadrangular tournament.

Track Starts 2nd Year
Field Events Added

by Phil Galvin

The Albany State Track Club
held its first meeting Monday,
and thirty-five men reported. Now
in its second year, the club’s ros-
ter seems to be greatly improv-
ed over last year.

Terry Mathias, Scott Price
and Sol Moshenberg are expect-
ed to be the main competitors in
100 and 220 yard sprints, while
cross-country runners dominate
the longer distances, with Frank
Myers and Paul Roy showing the
most promise in the quarter.

Roy will also compete in the
980 along with Don Myers, Rich
Horowitz and Joe McAndrew,
while Don Meyers, Pat Gepfert
and Larry Frederick will berun-
ning the mile.

There are many new faces
in the field events. Price and
Tom Sears will be high-Jumping,
and Moshenberg who achieved a
27-9 3/4 record in high school
is a prospect in the long jump.
Don Beevers will compete in the
shot and discus, and he and Greg

Masol will throw the lavelin.

Gary Torino, Moshenberg, and
Mathias should provide a solid
lineup in the triple jump, and
Royce VanEver is the top proa-
pect in the pole vault.

Coach Munsey has indicated
that he is pleased by the turn-
out, and that he feels the club
This a great deal of talent. How-
ever, he feels that the squad may
be lacking in depth. Especially
hurting are the hammerthrow and
the hurdles, for which no one
has tried out, and the shot, dis-
cus and high jump, in which there
are only one or two competitors.

Five meets are tentatively
scheduled, with Brandeis, Boston
State, Stony Brook, Plattsburg,
Hartwick, and LeMoyne as possi-
bilities. However, scheduling
has been hindered by the fact that
there can be no home meets.
The lanes on the new track were
improperly painted so the track
must be surfaced and repainted,
preventing any meets until next
year.
