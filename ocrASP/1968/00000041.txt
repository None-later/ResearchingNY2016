As the winter'sport's season draws to a‘ciose, it is
'easy to see that‘Albany's two winter sports provide

quite a contrast. The Great Dane hoepsters played
superbly. all year. With Rich Margison and Scott Price
leading the way Albany handled most opposition with rela-
tive ease, and'their record breaking fourteen game win
streak attests to the fact that this was one of the finest

teams in Albany history.

Margison and Price led the teaminscering, rebounding
and'sssists, but their supporting cast was also quite
impressive. Seniors Larry Marcus. and Tom Doody
supplied coach Sauers vwithvexcellent outside shooting
and steady all-around play, while sophomore guard Jack
Adams supplied speed and defense, along with a deft
outside touch. Transfer Bob Wood looked very good before
he ,was sidelined with pneumonia, and,“ Jim Caveriy,
another transfer, became the John Haviichekof Albany
basketball, as he frequently camein to supply the spark
that was needed to ignite the Great Danes offense. An-
other senior, Tim Jursak supplied Sauers with a reliable
backup man at center, and transfer Stef Smigiel seems
to be developing into a steady back court man.

in the final analysis about the only thing that went wrong
for the Great Danes this year was the fact that they were
denied the‘ NCAA bid which they so deservineg sought.
And the outlook for next year is just as bright. With
Margison and Price returning, things look good right off
the bat. Adam’s return means that the top three scores
will all be back, while Jack Jordan will be coming up
from the fresh where he hit for an amazing 24 points
per game. Caverly will return and may move into the
starting lineup, (unless Sauers feels that,he is indis-
pensible as a sixth man), andif Wood returns and Smigiel
continues to develop, the Danes certainly will not be

hurting.

However, wrestling is a different story entirely.
The grapplers, who finished 1-10, suffered such a long
list of injuries and disappointments that it is slightly
unbelievable. By the end of the season the team had been
so decimated that only seven wrestlers were left and of
these only two could really be considered experienced

wrestlers .

The grapplers opened their season against three top
opponents. and due to the holidays, and the semester
break they wrestled only these three matches in the
first month. The results were disappointing, and several
wrestlers quit before the season really got under way. in-
juries included: a concussion, a pinched nerve, bruised
ribs, an injured shoulder, and a broken nose, and all
were suffered by the most promising wrestlers. Add to
this the fact that the heavyweight wrestler transferred
at mid-semester and that four first string wrestlers had
dropped out by the end of the season, and one can see
the problems that Coach Garcia was confronted with. The
seven who remained to the end, worked long and hard,
and deserve credit for their efforts, but most of them
were very inexperienced, and the wrestling schedule is
not at all easy. Senior Bill Clark and Co-captain Craig
Springer were the only veteran wrestlers still ready,
willing and able, by the end of the season, and the out-
look for next year is not much better, as the only steady'
wrestlers that Garcia can count on returning, are Springer
and Roger Gorham, the team's other co-captain.

Marcus, Doody, Jursak
All Valuable Assets

Larry Marcus,Tom Doody, and
Tim Jursak will all be missed.
These three seniors all played
their last game as Albany Great
Danes, last Saturday, and all
made important contributions in
their three year careers.

Marcus, the team captain this
year, hit for 8.8 points per game,
and was the third leading re-
bounder, and the second best foul
shooter. Larry was voted fresh
MVP four years ago, and he
hit at a 11.8 point scoring clip
as a sophomore, last year he
was scoring at 9.7 points when
he was sidelined with a broken
wrist.

As sophomores Doody and
Jursak both showed that they,
had potential, as they came off
the bench to make vital con-
tributions to Albany's amazing
come from sound with oval-Sim-

Doody rarely saw action as a

sophomore, and was used only
sparingly last year as he record-
ed a 3 point per game average.
However, this year he won a
starting guard spot, and went on
to contribute a 6.5 point per
game average, with a better than
50 per cent shooting percentage.

Jursak has played a vital role
as substitute center for three
years, missing only one game in
the last two years. And by the
end of this year, you could be
sure that when Tim went in he
would get the lob done. it is a
sure thing that Sauers will miss
Tim's rebounding and defense.

These three seem to be some-
thing of a rarity here at Albany
as they have moved up together
since their freshmen year. All
won varsity letters for three

years, and the team’s three your

record while they were playing
was a rather impressive 46-20.

Fresh Top Union 76-66

Jordan Leads Scoring

by Joel Volin ski

The freshmen heopsters gave
Conch Mike O’Brien their fare-
well present in the form ofa sea-
son ending victory over Union,
76-66. it was the last game of
the season for both teams, but
Albany seemed to be more up
for the occasion. The fresh out-
hustled and generally outplayed
Union the entire game. The game
made Albany's final record 5-14,
while Union ended the year at
5-9.
Albany took very little time
in taking the lead. They led by
ten at 25-15 after ten minutes
and expanded their lead to 13
by the half. in the second half,
the Union freshmen came back
gamer to cut the gap to eight,
but Albany went on another streak
to again lead by ill with only
six minutes left. However, the
game was not over yet. The
fresh let their lead wither to
five with only a minute remain-
ing, but came back strong at the
end to assure their victory.

Scoring: Jordan ~30, Smith
—5, Doyle —12, Volinski —3,
MoDermitt —-7, Newmark —19,
Hebert.

The object of every freshman
coach is to produce talent for
the varsity. This Coach Mike
O'Brien did with constant hours
of working on the fundamentals
of the game with his players.

Over the year every player be-
came better and more complete
with this practice on man-to-man
defense, boxing out, ball handling,
and the other essentials. Jack
Jordan, Joel Veiinski, and Jim
Doyle have been asked to con-
sider going to the varsity next
year. Jordan led the area in
scoring with a 27 point average
and could start next year depend-
ing on the Junior College trans-
fers Doe Sauers 30‘3-

As a team the fresh came on
slowly. it wasn't until the tenth

game of the season that they 7

could actually be called a solid
unit.

There were only two, games
that the fresh were really out of,
a 39 point less to Hartwick and a
87 point less to RPl. Otherwise,
the fresh stayed in every game,
although some were sloppy while
in others they looked like pros.

The ax fell heavily on this
year’s team. Of the original 12
players, only six remained at the
end of the season. They played
and practiced under the most ad-
verse conditions, and no team
deserved a new gym more than
this one. in spite of their reputa-
tion as a “good' time" team,
they did work hard all the time,
perhaps losing some they should
have won, but never because of
lack of hustle or desire.

Regarding a possible
tourney berth, Director of
Sports information Richard

Rice Jr., has released the follow-
ing information. That (1) C.W.
Post, Farleight Dickinson, the
University of Rochester, Le-
Moyne, and Albany state are
under consideration for three
of the four at-lsrge bids in the
regional: (2) one of the above
teams, excluding Albany, will be
selected as a host team for the
tourney and thereby receive a
berth; and (a) the NCAA com-

‘ mittee will select the deserving

squads sometime early next
week. Therefore, the Albany con-
tests against ithaca and Cortland
next weekend will have no bearing
on the Sauermen’s chances
for their first NCAA tournament.

Buffalo State has the fourth
position automatically for win-
ning the State University Con-
ference championship.

All that one could ask for was
packed into the Albany-Stem cen-
test. Playing before anestimated
SRO crowd of 2,200 and with
over 1,000 fans stranded outside
Cardinal McCloskey, the Great
Danes and indians hooked up in
a tangle that will remain in the
memories of many for along time
to come.

Led by junior standout Rich
Margison, the Danes got off to
a quick 7-0 lead. Keeping the
pressure on, the Purple and Gold
raced to a 17-4 lead with 18:30
remaining and left the court at
halftime with a 46-34 advantage.

After Scott Price hit on a
jumper to put the Danes ahead
by 14 at the start of the second
stanza, Coach Tom Hanson’s
crew went on a 80-13 tear to
lead 64-59, with about eight
minutes remaining.

Trailing 68-84, with four
minutes to go, the Danes then
ripped off eight straight points
to go ahead, 72-68, a lead which
they never lost.

Margison, who scored a game
high of 25, hit four key baskets
in his final drive, three on spec-
tacular driving layups.

Science, HumanAffairsCenter
To Study Science Revolution

by Tim Keeley
Staff Reporter

At the President’s Conference
with students on Monday, Dr.
Clifton B. Theme, Vice-Presl-
dent for Student Affairs, in the
absence of President Evan R.
Collins, discussed the creation of
a center for science and human
affairs at the University.

This new center will study the
scientific revolution and its ef-
fect upon the people of the world.

Thorne announced the appoint-
ment of the center’s director,
Dr. Eugene Rabinowitz. Rabin-
owitz is internationally known
for his research on the effects
on the world population of the
scientific revolution.

Deadline Today
For Graduation
Applications

Today is the June degree up-
pllcotion deadline. All seniors,
who expect to graduate in June,
must pick up applications in the
Registrar's Office Administra-
tion Building room 120 by 4:30
this afternoon.

if in student does- not file for a
degree by today he will have to
wait until the August graduation
to be presented with a diploma.

Because the volume of work
the registrar's office will be
facing, it does not appear lhatthe
office will be able to extend the
deadline for students who neglect
to apply for their degree today.

Seniors who have filedfor their
degrees will be notified us soon
as possible if they how: not ful-
filled the requirements of their
program. Unfortunately, because
of the time element, most stu-
dents will not be able to correct
the deficiencies in their pro-
grams.

Most all of the students caught
in this position will be forced to
take summer courses or return
for another semester.

The initial meeting of this
group will be held Sunday on the
campus. Fifty selected people
with an interest in this area will
be attending this meeting.

Thorne commented that this
center is a significant develop-
ment on campus since it will
broaden the scope of the Univer-
sity and will be unique in the Uni-
versity system.

Other topics of discussion at
Monday’s conference included the
creation of a new committee by
the Faculty Senate of the State
University of New York and the
reorganization of the College of
Arts and Sciences.

Recently the Faculty Senate of
the State University of New York
recommended a statewide com-
mittee to be formed to study drug
education on the University cam-
puses.

This committee has been form-
ed with the purpose of evaluating
the various programs and sug-
gesting ways to improve the dis-
tribution of the information.

Thorns is umongthe half-dozen
members of this committee.

"The College of Arts and Sci-
encos has been reorganized at the
administrative level," comment-
ed Thorne. Two new associate
deans have been appointed to co-
ordinate this particular college.

A student present at the con-
ferenco informed Thorne that a
new student orgzinizulion was on
campus. The purpose of this new
group will be to gather student
evaluations of professors and
make them available to students.
To this 'l‘hol‘uo commented, “We
(the administration) would be
glad to see this done on u schol-

arly basis."

The President's conference is
open to any member ofihe student
body. President Collins and
Thorns make themselves avail-
able eoch week on Monday at 2:15
p.m. in the Patroon Room Lounge,
Campus Center.

The MYSKANIA tapping tradi-
tion dates back 52 years when the
first Mykies were tapped on the
shoulder as the entire junior
class walked across the stage on
Moving-Up Day.

Recently, because of the size
of the junior classes and the
abolishlon of Moving-Up Day,
each MYSKANIA member in turn
walks down the aisle and around
the auditorium, finally stopping
by the seat of a future Myskie.
As the gavel cracks three times,
his name is called and he walks
onto the stage.

Dean Chesin, giving the ad-
dress at the Inauguration, spoke
of the impersonal nature oflarge
academic institutions, indicating
that the University is as personal
as the student wishes to make it.

 

He believes that students
should seek out their professors
after classes and become better
acquainted with them through in-
teraction or communication.

Chesin feels that the Univer-
sity is a place for research and
study, not a center of political or
social activity. lie draws a par-

allel between the 0.5. which has
a strong, stable government and
a non-political college system,
and the European and Latin Amer-

Council Accepts Petition
0n U niv.Calendar’68-’69

by Vic Looper
Nfu/f li’f'IJDI‘IJ'I‘

Central Council accepted a
2,322 signature petition request-
ing at least a five day inter-
session for next year. A motion
to accept the petition and send
it to Dr. Clifton C. Thorne,Vice-
President of Student Affairs, was
passed 23—0-1.

The petition presented stated,
“We the undersigned students of
the State University of New York
at Albany, find it necessary to
appeal directly to the adminis-
tration in order to obtain an in-
tersesslon of at least five (5)
school days for the 1968-69 year.

"It has come to the attention of
the undersigned that Central
Council, our representative body
has not represented us properly
in the matter ofan intersession.”

There was considerable dis-
cussion on the petition and the
lack of an intersession, most of
which was a rerunofthe previous
calendar discussion. There were
a number of suggestions made,
some of which were new but most
were the same ones that were
suggested before.

One of the new suggestions was
presented by Neil C. Brown, the
Director of Student Activities and
the Campus Center. He suggest-
ed that in the future we look
into the possibility of a 4-1-5
system. This would involve tak—
ing four courses lst semester
and have exams before Christ-
mas, taking one course during
January and taking five courses

“The 'Mieirs oi Anotol" began lost Wednesday and will
continue Wed.—Sot., March 20-23, in Richnrdson 29l on the
old Campus. Performances begin at 8:30 thin-

  

second semester. Thus Christ-
mas vacation could serve as an
intersession.

Dr. Richard iiauser stated that
the University of Vermont has
this set up but is netentlrely sat-
isfied with it. Another objec-
tion was that, in order to grad-
uate within four years you must
occasionally take more’ than five
courses a semester. Under this
system y0u would not be able to
do it.

Some other suggestions were
signing up for courses on an
exam category system. This
would be set up so that courses
would be placed in exam cate-
gories. The biggest objection to
this was that this system would
reduce choice of courses.

Each solution involved a num-
ber of problems and objections.
Coming back to school a week
early would force papers to be
due before Christmas vacation
and exams would be right after
the vacation. Holding Saturday
classes or shortening vacations
was also objected to.

Duncan Nixon made a motion
to move Spring Semester back a
week. This was defeated 7-13-3
because this would make the sem-
ester iast until at least the first
week of June.

Most Councilmen felt that most
employers pick people on how
long they can work. Getting out
of school later would reduce the
students chance of getting a good
job.

Dr. Dumbleton stated that Fac-
ulty Senate was also concerned
about the lack of an intersesslon
but was not able to overcome the
problem.

Part of the problem is with
the days on which the vacation

Ofﬁcers Elected
By MYSKAN lA

The newly-elected MYSKANIA
1969 selected their officers for
the coming year in their first
meeting last Tuesday night. They
are: Chairman, Jeffrey hlishkin;
Vice-Chairman, Michael Schien—
void; Secretary, Ro cunts; Trea-
surer, Daniel Logo.

Upon accepting his position as
Chairman, Mlshkln stated, "i
expect to concentrate my efforts
only on MYSKANIA and the Class
of 1969. I have great hopes for
both."

He continued to say that one
of the most advantageous posi-
tions of MYSKANIA is that it
does not have any specific duties.
This allows each successive
group to decide on a program of
action in areas where it sees
the need for improvement.

“There are two key words for
a working MYSKANIA,” Mishkin
stated, "creativity and initiative.
This MYSKAN‘iA has both."
