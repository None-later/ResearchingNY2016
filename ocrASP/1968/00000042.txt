Atmospheric Sciences
 PheDe  uality In this situation.

by Janie Samuela

A doctoral program In Atmos-
pheric Science is among the sev-
eral new Ph.D curricula begun
at the University thisSeptember.

The aim of the program in At-
mospheric Science is to develop
in the student the ability to carry
on scholarly researchinthat field
and to communicate the results
concisely and accurately to the
scentific community and to the
general public.

The program prepares the stu-
dent for senior professional po-
iitions in Atmospheric Science
at academic institutions, in In-
dustry, government or other
agencies.

The Department is currently
offering four general areas of
specialization (1) cloud and pre-
cipitationphysics; (2) theoretical
and dynamical meteorology; (a)
mlcrometeorology and microcll-

Three students are presently
engaged in the program. Ralph
Markson is investigatingthe elec-
trical budget of the atmosphere.
He is interested In measuring
variations in time and magnitude
in the atmospheric electrical
field andcomparing these at Var-
ious locations where simultan-
eous measurements will be made.

One way by which the field
might vary is through inhanced
ionization In the upper atmos-
phere following a solar firm.

The uniqueness of Markson's
experiment lies in the fact thatif
successful it will be the first
time anyone will have directly
measured the electric field. This
will be accomplished by flying a
balloon on a wire to heights of
possibly 30,000 feet or more.

Eric Walther'a general areacl
interest is the study of air pol-
lution and the sciencedaerosals
which are airborne cles.His
research is at from a
health standpoint.

Despite the fact that carbon
monoxide is being continuously
injected into the atmosphere via
combustion processes e.g. auto
exhaustion, industry, the concen-
tration a co in the air is not
increasing drastically with time.

Processes exist that remove
the CO from the atmosphere and
one of these processes is the at-
tachment of CO to these air born
particles or aerosols. if these
aerosols are respired or breath-
ed then the attached COcan reach
the lower lung and replace oxy-
gen on the hemoglobin of the red
blood cells.

Tongue Suggests Changes

In Vietnam War Policy

Walter Teague, Chairman of
the United States Committee to
aid the HLF in South Viet Nam,
was the guest speaker for the
Student Faculty Committee to End
the War, last week. Mr. Teague
presented an NLF film entitled
"We Will Win" and then spoke
on the need to change the present
situation.

The film portrayed the various
weapons and the extent of the
determination d the Viet Cong
in fighting the war. It then por-
trayed American troops and said
that every day "Yankees mul-
tiply their atrocities." Some of
the scenes were familiar be-
cause they had been used on the
NBC special a few weeks ago to
highlight the difficulty that Amer-
ican troops are having.

Mr. Teague pointed out that
the committee to aid the NLF is
not anti-American but is looking
out for the best interests of the
people of the Unitedstates. He be-
lieves that this can best be done
by supporting the National Liber-
ation Front, which Is the right
arm of the Viet Cong. He said
that we must face the factthat we
are a "racist" people and can
be seen as "debased, crude and
hostile."

In contrast, Mr. Teague des-
cribed the NLF as simply want-
ing to "protect their own Inter-
erests” and establish a “peace-

He stated that Ky Is known to fol-

in speaking to the Committee
about the administration, of the
University, he said that It was

This, according to the speaker
was simply a part of the system
of this country which uses police

University Enters
Turtle Internat’l;

Sponsors “Minnie”

The University will be repre-
sented at the American Univer-
sity’s Turtle international '68 at
Washington's Woods-Brown Out-
door Theater on May 11. Awater
terrapln, rumored to he named
“Minnie,” will be the Student
Association sponsored entry in
the turtle race for the benefit of
Muscular Dystrophy.

Every college In the United
States and many universities
throughout the world have been
invited to participatelnthe thirty-
flve foot dash for turtles six
inches and under. Coverage of
last year's race In which over
200 colleges participated includ-
ed national and international tele-
vision and newspaper coverage
and commendations from The
Merv Griffin Show and ABC’s
Wide World of Sports.

The Turtle international has
been turned into a weekend event
with a formal dance on Friday
night and a concert on Saturday
for all those who go to encour-
age thelr school’s entry.

Any recognized college or unl-
verslty may enter a water terra-
pln between three and six inches
long. All entries must be named.
Official rules state: "We can’t
have nameless turtles wandering
around."

Fairness requires that "No
turtle will be allowed to wear or
have In his possession any
artificial aids (I.e., turtle skates,
grease on belly, etc.) The Senior
Keeper of the National Zoo's Rep-
tile i'iouse suggests, "the male
painted pond turtle for the best
race."

The race course shall consist
of a 35-foot long, inclined ramp
with guard rails on both sides
"for turtles with a poor sense of
direction." Turtles shall race
from top to bottom of the ramp.
At the bottom there will be a
trough of water as an Incentive
to the racers.

The winner will be the first
turtle to touch the water. Turtles
immediately following the winner
will place In accordance with
their entry into the water. Racers
may not be touched or physically
stimulated during the racehy any
other means than cheering or
uttering turtle love calls.

middle of the week making It
unfeasible to cut days out.

Brown stated that President
Collins has asked theRegIstrnrto
explore the possibility of cutting
off 2 days of exam period as a
way to alleviate the problem.
Thus, after much dlscusslon and
debate, the problem was left un-
resolved.

Council pussed :1 bill setting
up an ud-Iioc committee to oval»
uute all student linen and health
Insurance problems. They would
recommend to Council whether
to retain or extend existing pro-
grams or select those which
would give students the greatest
possible benefit.

The Committee will be com-
posed of two student members
of Council, the Director of Stu-
dent Activities or his dustgncc
:qu two members of iv‘SA.

Council would submit Its rec-
ounncnduilons Io Ibc i-"SA Board
of Directors which would finalize
the agreement. The Committee
was necessary because the pres-
ent two your contracts are ex-
plring.

Council also pasacdu Violation
of u Rider Policy. This would
empower Finance Committee "to
revoke any budget which has had
any riders upon said budget vio-
lated.”

This was felt necessary be—
cause there are a number of rid-
ers attached to next year's bud-
gets which would not mean any-
thing unless there was a strong
penalty, whcb could be enacted
if a group refused to comply with
the rider.

Student Pressures Topic

0f Shoben Speech

by Loren Ostronder

Dr. Joseph Shoben, a noted
psychologist who has taught for
15 years at Coumbla University
emphasized that more interaction
between students and professors
Is needed to eliminate some of
the problems on today’s cam-
puses in a lecture on "Student
Pressures and College Prob-
lems.”

Shoben said that the troubles
that society now faces are the
same troubles that students are
facing today. Shoben continued to
say that the problems affecting
students and student faculty mem-
bers are problems which colleges
and universities cannot control.

Vietnam , selective service, and
black power are such topics in
which colleges and universities
have no direct control. These is-
sues then affect youth generally,
but college youth particularly.

Not only is there the fact of
the "massive presence" of youth
In college, but Shoben stressed
that there is also a great diver-
sity of population In college stu-
dents.

Another way, Shoben said, that
the college youth are affected dif-
ferently Is that when such great
numbers of youth attend college,
the students "achieve corporate
identity." This corporate Iden-
tity Is the college campus. "Stu-
dents are treated as a kind of
social class."

With size and group solidar-
Ity, the rise of student power
Is not surprising, Shoben stated.
Students wont to have u say in
political and soclnldcclsionslhut
affect them.

Because the cumpus Is where
all of these students are, this Is
where the students exhibit their
want of power. Shoben remarked
again that campus unrest is due
to the size of the student popula-
tion and the students' corporate
Identity.

Shoben continued by showing
how higher education has created
many problems. Higher education
bus broadened the students’
awareness. The Issues that of—
fect young people are Issues that
the colleges and universities have
no certain View on.

When there are no setviewswn
:1 subject, you have academic
freedom. Academic freedom
should also mean that any tenure
faculty member of a university
can express :my views on topics
such as South East Asia, without
fear of reprisal.

The University must remain
neutral and the only committment
that the university should make
concerning academic freedom Is
on open campus where "all ideas
may have a bearing.”

Difficulties that arise between
students and universities result
from misunderstandings of both
the students' position and the un-
Iversity’s position.

Shoeben continued, saying that
today there are two major cate—

gories of response toward stu-
dents from adults. Either, kids
are the same as ever, or kidsto-
day have greatly changed.

Shoben comes to the conclu—
sion that college youths are dif-
ferent. He comes to this conclu-
sion by stating the fact that the
maturity age declines each de-
cade.

The second reason is that be-
cause of mass media,the present
generation Is much more Inform-
ed than the parents' generation.

The third reason, according to
Shoben, is the mobility of the
American population. With ac-
cess to education there Is an in-
creased familiarity of life of
different groups of people.

With this change, Shoben went
on, there Is a "confrontation be~
tween. . . traditional essential-
lsts points of view. . . n'l exist-
entialists one." The difference
between these groups are evi-
dent.

Shoeben stated that existen-
tIalIsts believe that "what is
moral is an outgrowth of my con-
cern." in other words the “pri-
macy of the present," whereas
essentiallsts believe In "primacy
of the past and the future.”

Another difference Is that the
cxistentiaiist believes In Immed-
iate social justice and the essen-
tIaIIst believes in graduallsm,
gradual acceptance of imperfec-
tions of man. Studentunrest,sho-
ben declared, is conductive be-
cause of these two groups of stu-
dents.

Shoben says that the univer-
sities should be changed In the
way they are conducted. Profes-
sors are rewarded by society be-
cause ofIntellectualperformance
and research, not for their ef-
fecliveness In helping students
to learn. The development of stu-
dents should be their primary
concern.

Helping students with issues
that the universlty has no control
over should also become part of
a professor's job.

 

by Ira Wolhnnn
Sta/I [reporter

Students and faculty will have
the opportunity this coming Wed-
nesday, March 20, to review
and comment upon a special re-
port on University program-
ming entitled “New patterns in
Undergraduate Education."

A special committee of the
Undergraduate Academic Coun-
cil was appointed in January,
1967, to take a fresh look at
the new situation of the Univer-
sity and its undergraduate pro-
grams. The committee dealt with
the entlre structure of pro-
gramming, not simply the details.
it has already submitted a first
draft of the report, which was
reviewed and criticized by both
the Undergraduate Academic
Council, and the joint Student-
Faculty Seminar.

The report has now been re-
vised and rewritten and is go-
Ing to be submitted, in Its sec-
ond draft, to the comments and
suggestions of the entire univer-
sity community.

The main components of the
report are concerned with what
the committee feels are improve-
ments upon the organization of
current curriculum, or additions
to It. Among the many proposals
is the Institution of a three year
masters program. This would
simply entail the pursuit of a mas-
ters degree through the upper
level years in college (Junior
and Senior years) and one addi-
tional year of study. According
to Dean 0, William Perlmuiter,
this program has already been
used in certain universities in the
nation.

Among the more unusual pro-
posuls of the committee was the
Institution of an "Experimental
College," which would Integrate
the last three years of high
School and the first two of col-
lege. in this plan, students would
be admitted in the tenth grade.

The recurring theme of the re-
port is an emphasis on “Indepen-
dent study." The report states,
"We strongly recommend that
all necessary steps be taken to
make independent study a domi-
nant factor on the Albany Cam-
pus." This is not to infer that
Independent study is not present-
ly going on at the university,
but simply to encourage a great-
er expansion of the many out-
lets for it.

Report OnNewPatterns
,InUndergrad Programs

Another proposal deals with
the type of "program" a student
would enter. There are provi-
sions for two new types of pro-
grams, the General College and
the Departmental program. The
General College would be pri-
marily involved with general,
liberal arts education; thiswould
be its specialty. 0n the other hand
the "departmental program"
would allow a student to enter
directly into the department of his
anticipated major, and follow the
suggestions and recommenda-
tions of the department in plan-
ning his program, both in liberal
arts and in specialized studies.

These proposals are by no
means final; they will be subject
to student and faculty recommen-
dations this coming March 20
in the Campus Center. At that
time, a "seminar" type meet-
ing will be held, to which the en-
tire university community is In-
vited. There will be time for
any comments of suggestions that
will be forthcoming. After the
report has again been discussed
and reviewed, It will again be
revised.

The programs set forth in the
report are of varying ranges.
According to Perlmutter, some
of the programs can be institut-
ed almost immediately, while oth-
ers will take time and careful
work before they can become
realities.
