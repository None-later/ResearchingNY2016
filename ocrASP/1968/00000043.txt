Deans Appointed '
For - Arts.

in a reorganisation of the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences at‘the
University, two associate deans '
have been appointed. ,Theassoci-
ate deans, who will serve under
Dr. 0. William Perlmutter, dean
of the college, are Dr. Eugene
H. McLaren and Dr. Charles W.
Colman.

The ultimate intention of the
reorganization is to replace the
chairmen of the three divisions
of the College of Arts and
Sciences with three associate
deans. The associate deans not
only will discharge the functions
previously performed by division
chairmen, but also will have cer-
tain college-wide responsibili-
ties.

Dr. McLaren, who formerly
was chairman of the division of
science and mathematics, al-
ready has assumed his new
duties, Dr. Colman will move to
his new post September 1 when
Dr. Edward P. Shaw, presently
chairman of the division of hu-
manities, returns to teachingand
writing. Dr. Shaw had asked tobe
relieved of his administrative
duties.

Dr. McLaren, a professor of
science who joined the faculty in
1960, holds degrees from State
University at Albany and from
Washington University where he
received his doctorate. Dr. Col-
man, professor oi Romance
languages, has been on the Uni-
versity's faculty since 1984. He
did undergraduate work at Her-
vard University. From the Uni-
versity de Bordeaux he received
his certificate d’etudes fran-
caises. His doctoral degree is
from Cornell University.

Dr. Shaw, also a professor of
Romance languages, has been on
the University's faculty since
1947. Author of several published
works, he has conducted exten-
sive research in Europe. Dr.
Shaw has been honored as a
Chevalier of the Order of Acade-
mic Palms of France.

Lowis To Discuss
New York Theatre

Robert Lewis, this year's
holder of the Agnes E. Futterer
Lectureship in Dramatic Art at
the State University of New York
at Albany, will present his second
of two public lectures on Monday,
March 18, in Page Hall at
8:30 p.m.

The lecture, sponsored by the
Theater Alumni Association and
the Department of Speech and
Dramatic Art at the University,
is open to the public, and there
is no admission charge.

Tickets of admission are
necessary and may be ob-
tained by calling the State Uni-
versity Theatre box office at the
Campus Center or at the door
the evening of the lecture.

The subject for Mr. Lewis'
second lecture will be the current
New York theatre season, and
appropriately Mr. Lewis calls
his talk "0n Non Critic Reviews
the New York Theatre sea-
son." The title, he says, was
chosen to make clear the fact
that he is not now, never has
been, and never will be a critic.

His point of view of the New
York season will be that of a
director, actor, and teacher with
thirty years of professional ex-
perience. From that perspective,
Mr. Lewis plans to discuss both
Broadway and Off-Broadway
shows and to relate them to his
own theory of theatre which he
calls The Third Force.

in his first lecture this year,
Mr. Lewis discussed in detail
his theory that both physical and
emotional elements of theatre
must be brought into balance if
American theatre is ever to fully
develop.

As part of his non-critic's re-
view of the current New York
season, Mr. Lewis plans toraisu
and discuss such questions as
“How sick is the Fabulous in.
valid" Iiis reference, of course,
is to the widely-held opinion that
Broadway theatre is seriously
ill and perhaps dying.

After his talk, Mr. Lewis will
invite questions from the au-
dience. and that, he says, is when
the "fun really begins at any
lecture,"

By ‘Mademoiselle’ Magazine

"Mademoiselle" magazine has
a College Board program that en-
ables students to participate in
some of the magazine's activi-

-ties. Each College Board member

will have an opportunity to con-
tribute to "Mademoiselle" and
help the magazine keep abreast
of campus trends.

College Board members report
regularly to "Mademoiselle" on
events at their colleges, research
articles and help the magazine's
fashion editors select models for
college fashion features.

The Boardis composed ofsome
1000 winners of the magazine’s
annual nationwide College Board
Competition, :1 contest designed
to recognize young women with
talent in art, writing, editing,
photography, layout, fashion de-
sign, merchandising, retail pro-
motion or advertising.

Board members are selected
on the basis of entries they sub-
mit showing ability in one of
these fields. Each girl will re-
main on the College Board until
she graduates.

American Colleges
To Spend Millions

On Construction

Washington (CPS) American
colleges and universities are in
the midst of a multi-million dol-
lar, five-year construction pro-
gram, according to the US. office
of Education.

More than 12, 000 projects cost-
ing an estimated $17 billion have
been planned for the period be-
tween fall 1965 and fall 1970.
The Office of Education surveyed
1,781 colleges, about ’73 per cent
of the nation's institutions.

Public colleges and univer-
sities, which plan to spend about
$11.5 billion, are relyingon state
and local appropriations and
federal grants for abouthalftheir
funds. The other half of the funds
will come mostly from bond
issues.

More than half of the $5.5
billion to be spent by private
schools will come from current
funds, gifts, endowments, and
private or commercial loans, the
other half from bonds and federal
grants.

About 50 per cent of the $17
billion will be spent on instruc-
tional facilities, 20 per cent on
residential buildings, and 10 per
cent for research facilities.

Public institutions plan to boost
teaching facilities for graduate
students by 75 per cent and those
for undergraduates by 54 per
cent. The figures for private
schools are 41 and 32 per cont,
respectively.

New York, California, Pennsyl-
vania, and lllinois are the four
leading states in the amount of
construction.

During this time, she will ac;
cumulato a professional portfolio
of work submitted to “Mademoi-
selle” which may well be valu-
able to her in finding a challeng-
ing job after graduation.

Once a student has been select-
ed for the College Board, she is
eligible to compete for "Ma-
demoiselle's" 20 grand prizes.
Each year, 20 of the Board mem-
bers are chosen to become Guest
Editors.

To win one of these positions,
a Board member must submit a
second entry that shows superior
aptitude for magazine work.

The 20 Guest Editors Spend the
month of June in New York and
edit "Mademoiselle's" August
college issue, sharing offices
with the magazine's editors.

They interview well-known per-
sonalitites and represent the
magazine's regular editors on
visits to publishing houses,
stores and advertising agencies.
They are "Mademoiselle's"
guests at parties, dlscotheques
and screenings.

In addition, they are photo-
graphed for the August issue and
receive special consideration for
future staff positions with"Made-
moiselle" and other Conde Nast
publications. The 1967 Guest
Editors bad a special bonus —- a
week's trip to Peru.

This year the University will
be represented on the"Mademol-
selle" College Board by Jane
Kowicz and Susan Sammartlno.

An exhibit of prehistoric an-
imal sculpture by Louis Paul
Jonas will be the first show in
the Biology Museum, Bi 114,
during this month and part of
April.

Jonas, for merlywiththeAmer-

ican Museum of Natural History,
has for many years been known
as the finest animal sculptor
in the country. The dinosaurs
included in this exhibit were
originally done as models for
his life-size ones exhibited at
the 1964-65 New York World's
Fair.
Animal Sculpture ofJoms’ will
be featured in the museum
throughout the remainder of the
semester. Beginning in April and
lasting through part of May, will
be a show of African mammals.
North American Mammals will
be shown for the remainder of
May and into June.

Along with these exhibits the
Museum will also house live and
preserved marine animals, ex-
amples of faculty and student re-
search, and portraits of famous
biologists. The collection of an.
tique microscopes will remain
on display in the ball just out-
side the museum.

Ryland Loos, curator of the
Museum, hopes that it will serve
to stimulate interest in the biol-
ogical sciences through visual
presentations. He further cited
a number of other functions of
the museum.

It can provide information of
general interest on subjects re-
lated to biology which are not
necessarily covered in any par-
ticular classes. Also, this mu-
seum will be able to consolidate
material on a particular subject
or series of subjects into r
more involved demonstration

Haight-Ash bury Changes

Seen In Streets, Crime.

by uovid Berson

(CPS) — Last summer the
Haight was the happy home of
the Love Generation andthe darl~
ing of the American press. it
was, for many, the place to be.

The weather was gorgeous,
food was free; there was music
in Golden Gate Park, plenty of
healthy young people walking
around the streets.

But when the summer ended
and it baton to get cold on Haight
street, the college vacationers
and dedicated travelers went
home or moved on.

And the street scene began to
change. Marijuana and acid were
replaced by methedrine, social
diseases became a problem for
everyone, and it was too cold for
music in the park.

For the first time Height-Ash-
bury became a dangerous place.
Junkies pulled burglaries and
rapes, and the panhandlers began
to get more aggressive.

Dealers came to be feared as
news spread that the Haight was
no place to score. And Height
Street was beginning to look like
a psychedelic skid row.

Then the police began to tight-
en up. There were large drug
busts and street sweeps in search
of runaway teeny -boppers. No-
body knew who was who and who
and even fewer people could be
trusted.

When the disturbance broke
out on a February Sunday, the
city's response was quick. Police
in 20 squad cars, 15 motorcycle
officers, and five riot command
units ended the four-hour disrup-
tion.

The man who called out the po-
lice was the new San Francisco
mayor Joseph Alloto, a tough and
articulate Democrat who had been
through the whole thing before
when the police met some of the
Bay Area left wing at aSanFrun~
cisco appearance of Dean Rusk.
The results were the same and
so was Alioto’s explanation.

“The policy of the city is
clear,” he said after the lluight

to use the streets to say any-
thing, no matter how unpopular.
But the minute anyone blocks
streets or throws bottles or inter-
feres with the Constitutional
rights of others by storm troop-
ers tactics, then the city is going
to get tough.”

He said that the police moved
on the people in the street only
after repeated warnings that the
street be clear.

But for the people in the Haight,
what is now in the middleoftheir
community is a question mark.
Nobody really knows what it all
means and most of all, what lies
in the future. Most people in the
Haight are looking tothe summer
and hoping for another good one.

To Use. Whatever Works

by Barb Groasmen

Andy Gill, a member of the
Albany Civil Rights Group, the
Brothers, speaking before a sla-
able audience in the state Quad
Flag Room last Thursihy eve-
ning. stated that the American
Negro is not responsible for in-
ternational problems like Viet-
nam, and should get away and
create his own identity.

Gill, filling in until Leon Van
Dyke, leader of the Brothers,
appeared said he doesn’t want
Negroes to end up in the same
position that lsrael is in now—
surrounded on all sides by ene-
mies and bound to be eventually
defeated. He feels, instead, that
Negroes should band together and
form their own community.

White attempts to solve the
problem of civil rights are inef-

fective and useless according to

Gill. What the white man thinks
does not count any more. What
Gill wants is a pullingtogetherof
the "black race" intheU.S.from
the "white race"-"black power.”

Leon Van Dyke, on the other
hand, is dedicated to what Gill
calls "grass roots black power.”
As Van Dyke says, "l’m for any-
thing that works,” which means
peaceful demonstration, picket-
ing, or riots — whatever works.

He does not feel that the Negro
should withdraw from the white
community. He said that just as
not all Negroes are good, not all
whites are bad. But Van Dyke is
101 satisfied with the contribution
of "white liberals." Hefeelstbat
Negroes need what he calls
.“white radicals."

"White radicals” are mainly
college students who more than
just recognise the failureof "lib-
erals" to achieve any real
success toward Negro equality.
The main contribution of "liber-
sis," according to Van Dyke, is
to contribute money to keep thi
Negro from revolting. What the
Negro needs is radical, or quick
change.

There is a place for the stu-
dent in the struggle for civil
rights. They can raise money,
demonstrate, or leave school un-
til more Negroes are admitted,
but Van Dyke does not think that
students should do anything that
is the responsibility of the local
government, such as removing
garbage from slum areas.

Van Dyke does not think that
change can really come about
peacefully, but he does not be-
lieve in all-out war either. The
riots of the past summers, he
feels, were not effective. The
whites are just too strong tobe
overcome or influenced by riots.
And Van Dyke is really more in-
terested in social and economic
change than political power.

The revolt against economic
inequality is not just by Negroes,
said Van Dyke. He sees no rea-
son why whites below the pover-
ty level should not be just as out-
raged by their position as the poor
Negro.

According to Van Dyke, the
existing economic conditions are
not only unfair to the Negroes,
but also to those whites who
must also do menial labor to sup-
port a family in a dirty, rundown
tenement. And it is even more
unfair to those who can find no
work at all in a land of such
prosperity, and must live onwel-
fare.

As Van Dyke explained it, the
members of the Brothers repre-
sent ail shades on the spectrum
from militant black power to
peaceful integration. As for him-
self, he repeated his theme that
he was for "whatever works
best."

Van Dyke said that all black
organizations have the same ob-
jectives: jobs, housing, etc. . . it
is only their tactics that differ.
When questioned about the Black
Muslims, he said that he was
not against their doctrines and
methods because they are right
for their members.

He did say that the Muslims
are the best organized and most
disciplined Negro organization
in the country.

When Van Dyke was asked if
the Negro would not want more
power once the present objec-
tives were achieved, and if he
would "stomp" on the white man
just as the white man "stomped"
on him, he said that just because
the Negro wanted more rights,
such as education and adequate
housing, it did not mean that he
would try to deny these rights to
whites.

Van Dyke and Gill did agree,
however, that if the tables were

turned, the Negromightbetempt-
ed to "stomp" on the whites.
Neither of them felt that the Ne-
gro was powerful enough to
threaten the whites, though.

Van Dyke predicted no hope for
a drawing together of the races
this summer. He saidwecanonly
wait and see how bad and how
numerous they will be.

Van Dyke stated that if peace-
ful methods continued to be in-
effective, there would be riots,
and if the riots were ineffective,’
white Americans would have to
put American Negroes into con-
centration camps.

He added that there could be
"no social order without social
justice, and no peace without
freedom."

Frosh Class ’72
To Be 15%Larger

Applications for the class of
1972 at the University closed on
February 29. Approximately
8,000 students applied for the
class of 1,700, a 15 per cent in-
crease in applications of those
received last year.The new class
will be about 15 per cent larger
than the current freshmen class.

Frank G. Krivo, director ofad-
mlssions, said, “Although the
number of spaces in the fresh-
man class has increased at the
same rate as the applications,
the quality has increased at a
higher level to the point where
this year's admission to the
freshman class has been more
competitive than last year’s. We
are right now in the process a
setting up a waiting list."
