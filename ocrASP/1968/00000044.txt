Last week's ASP (March 1)
contained a diatribe from a so-
called Arab American. Although
large portions were hardly in-
telligible, the distortions, false-
hoods and naked hatred showed
through, nevertheless.

The letter started out with the
accusation that Israel had dia-
regarded U.N. resolutions. The
correspondent had obscured
these resolutions beyond recogni-
tion and further chose to ignore
the fact that the Arab nations that
have harrassed Israel for 20
years and who in May and June
1967 launched an attack onlsrael
had continuously violated the U. N.
charter itself. Why didn't he in-
form his readers ofthe provision
in the U. N. resolution of
November 22, 1987 calling for
secure and recognized frontiers
between Israel and the Arab
states? He failed to consider the
basis whereby for the past 20
years Jordan held not only the
city of Jerusalem but also the
whole west bank and also the
basis for Egypt's control of the
Gaza strip. Was this In accord
with a U. N. resolution? Absolute-
ly not. Jordan and Egypt tookand
held these territories in 1948
in violation of the resolution of
the U.N. on partition which de-
clared that an independent Arab
state he set up In those terri-
tories.

He keeps saying Jordanian
Jerusalem as if by saying it he
can deceive his readers into
thinking that there is some
natural connection between Jor-
dan and Jerusalem where in fact
there is none. For twenty years
Jordan illegally occupied the old
city of Jerusalem. All during this
illegal occupation Jordan pre-
vented free access to the holy
places in spite of the pious state-
ment issued by the Arab govern-
ments that such access would be
permitted. What their statement
save is that free access wouldbe
permitted if Israel ceased to exist
(even if its existence had been
established by aU.N. resolution).
Not only were people of theJewlsh
faith, regardless of their citizen-
ship, denied access but even the
Moslems and Christians oflsrael
were also denied access to their
holy shrines. Even Moslems and
Christians who were citizens of
other countries could not have
free access if their passports
contained a stamp indicating that
they had come to Israel. That
pious statement of free access
quoted by the writer of theletter
was an absolute absurdity if it
was not a deception. I don't think
that others cannot see through
the most transparent deception.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

V is" Accused 7
Aggression

The correspondent writes that
"successive generations of Mul-
lim pilgrims rubbed their cheeks
in humility and supplication on
thresholds of the tombs of Abra.
ham, David, Solomon and
Moses." How quaint! One might
question the reliability of his
allegations in other parts of his
letter in view of the last verse
of these quoted from Deuter-
onomy Ch. 34.

“90 Moses the servant of the

. Lord died there in the land of

Moab, according to the word of
the Lord. And he was buried in
the valley in the land of Moab
over against Beth peer; and N0
MAN KNOWETH OF HIS
SEPULCHER UNTO THIS DAY.”

Would our Arab.American cor-
respondent tell us what happened
to the synagogues and other
Jewish institutions in the ancient
city of Jerusalem? Now that the
Israelis have finally gained ac-
cess, the truth can be known.
They were all destroyed and
desecrated. Jews lived in that
city from the days of David until
20 years ago when the Jews of
Jerusalem and indeed the Jews
who lived anywhere in the Arab
world were driven out of their
homes in Bagdad, Damascus,
Cairo, and Alexandria; places in
which they had lived from long
before the time of Mohammed's
birth. I have visited Israel on a
number of occasions and have
travelled its length and breadth.
I have not seen one Moslem holy
place desecrated and I have seen
many in good repair and well
maintained—from Acre to Beer-
sheba, from Abu to Tarshlcha.
The same is alsotrue for Christi-
an sanctuaries both in the Arab
villages and in the large cities.
The same is true also for the
Druse community and for the
Bahai community. Israel can
match freedom of religion with
any country in the world and sur-‘
passes by far the Arab countries
and their ally, Russia, with re-
spect to the freedom accorded
to any but the dominant religion.
The Arab and Russian treatment
of Jews is a blot on the history
of those nations.

Another example of the false-
hoods found in the letter is the
reference to the desecration of
the Mamillah cemetery in New
Jerusalem. I visited there last
May and there it stood undis-
turbed. Our correspondent could
also have visited there and still
can with an American passport
in spite of his vile hatred coward
Israel. Yet I, withaslmilar pass-
port, could not gain entry to any
Arab country because of my faith.
When the Israelis entered the old
city of Jerusalem lastJuneit was
disclosed that the Jewish ceme-
tery near the Mt. of Olives had
been destroyed and the grave-
stones used for paving blocks
and in the construction of a
latrine. This is how the Arabs
are “uniquely fitted" as the
“titular guardians of the Holy
Places."

if one needs proof shout about
the _treatment accorded to Arab
Christians and Moslems in Israel
one need only consider the con-
duct of these citizens during the

Teacher Corps T o Recruit Non-Ed Majors

More college graduates are
being called for service in the
Teacher Corps. It was announced
today by Richard A. Graham, the
Director of the Corps.

The Corps is a two year old
nationwide program that provides
help for youngsters in over-
crowded, understaffed slum
schools by turning non-education
majors into poverty School teach-
ers.

"We're interested in those who
feel a sense of urgency about the
country's social crisis; people
who are looking for training for a
tough job," Graham said.

Unlike most graduate teacher-
training programs, the Corps re-
cruits and trains people holding
degrees in areas other than edu-
cation. Teacher-interns are col-
lege graduates, four-fifths of
them with liberal arts, business
or science degrees. They receive
provisional certification when
they enter the school system.

Service in the Corps includes
enrollment in a university for two
years of tuition-free graduate
study leading to a Masters "De-

gree

and on-the-job training in

poverty area schools. Teacher-

Kennedylntroduccs'

Bill In Senate
To Change Draft

Washington (CPS) — Sen. Ed-
ward Kennedy (D-Mass.) has in-
troduced an 18 part bill in the
Senate that provides for drastic
changes in the Selective Service
System, most of them aimed at
reducing the powers oflocal draft
boards.

Two of the bill’s major pro-
visions are that draftees should
be chosen by random selection
and that the youngest men should
be taken first.

It also provides for the estab-
llshmentlof several hundred area
offices to take over the functions
presently carried out by local
draft boards. The Senator pro-
posed that local draft boards be-
come appeal boards for men in-
ducted by one of the area offices.
The areapoffice plan was origin-
ally proposed by the draft com-
mission set up by PresidentJohn-
son last spring.

In his speech introducing the
bill in the Senate, Kennedy critic-
ized several of the draft law
amendments passed by Congress
last June. He suggested thatCon-
grcss enacted some of the amend-
ments simply to reduce the fights
of draftees.

As one example he cited the
1967 amendment that says the
courts can't review a decision
made by ’a" Selective Service
Board unless the registrant in-
volved is charged withacrimlnal
violation. The amendment means,
in effect, that a draftee can’t
challenge adraitboard's decision
in the courts until he has been
charged with violating the draft
law.

The Senator said this amend-
ment is an "unprecedented at.
tempt to work mischief with con-
stitutional rights, and it should
be stricken from the law."

Among the provisions in Ken-
nedy's bill are the following:
Students should be given “post.-
ponements" during up to four
years in college. but that these
postponements should no longer
be granted if draitees are becom-
ing heavily involved in combat
action.

Occupational deferments
should be granted by the Presi-
dent on a uniform national basis
rather than being left to local
boards.

studies should be madeintothe
feasibility of a volunteer army,
and into the possibility ofallowing
draft age men to fulfill their serv-
ice requirement outeide of the
military.

Using the draft to punish pro-
testers should be prohibited.

The term of theSelective Serv-
ice Director should be limited to
six years (Kennedy wonld except
Gen. Hershey from this provision
—Hershey has been the director
since 1940).

Courts should be allowed to
review draft board decisions.

Although Kennedy's bill has
virtually no change of passage,
it could generate debate on the
draft In the Senate, and thereby
lead to some kind of congres-
sional action of the draft.

The co-sponsors of his bill
are Sens. Clifford Case (R-N.J.),
Walter Mondale (D-Minn.), Gay-
lord Nelson (D-Wls.) Joseph Ty-
dings (D-Md.). All are liberals
whose support for this kind of
bill was predictable.

In order to fill the credibility
gap of the establishment news
services, the brothers and
sisters of the Trl-Cities Black
students Alliance presents the
following facts concerning the re-
cent massacre of our brothers
and sisters in Orangeburg, S.C.:

Monday, Feb. 5: Student lead-
ers from South Carolina State
College attempted to desegregate
the all-white bowling alley owned
by Harry F. Ford. The operator
of the bowling alley refused to
admit the black students.

Tuesday, Feb. 6: Students again
attempted to desegregate the
bowling alley and were again
turned away. Twenty students
were arrested. Later, after word
h been circulated on campus
60 students from the college
went down to the shopping center
where the bowling alley is locatp
ed and demanded that those
arrested be released.

Approximately 150 law en-
forcement officials were on the
scene and some of them, attempt-
ing to disperse the crowd, began
to beat the students. 20 persons
were injured and were treated at
the college infirmary.

Wednesday, Feb. 7: Students
met all day and all night, dis-
cussing the violence and police
brutality directed toward them
the previous night, and also pro-
testing the failure of the South
Carolina State Legislature to ap-
prove the budget or to allocate
funds for the college, although
funds had been appropriated for
the all-white University of South
Carolina.

The Teachers’
Draft Counseling Committee

The Teachers' Draft Counseling Committee recognizes that many of our young
men question whether or not they can, as a matter of conscience, serve as soldiers
in the Vietnam War, and further, that, under conditions imposed by the draft law,
the choice of service, alternate service, or non-service represents, for many, a
serious choice about life goals, and for others, a far reaching personal crisis. The
Committee takes the position, therefore, that, asieachers and responsible members
of the academic community, we must help such young men obtain information on
all altcmaiives and examine their own feelings to the end that they arrive at a
rational and emotionally satisfactory decision about their role, if any, in the

at students and into buildings. A
campus guard was shot and
wounded. student leaders, who
had submitted a list of griev-
ances to the Orangeburg City
Council, staged a "prayer-in"
during the early eveningand later
held a meeting in a ball park
near the campus.

National Guardsmen, claiming
they were fired upon, charged
into the group of students, firing
at random. The students, seeking
cover, fell to the ground.

The aftermath: 30 students in
jail, to in the hospital, 3 dead.
SNCC staff member, Cleveland
Sellers, is in a South Carolina
penitentiary on $50,000 bond,
charged with inciting to riot,
arson, assault with intent to kill,
and damaging propegty.

Why has the power structure
never sent out armed forces to
suppress white student demoli-
strators at white campuses?

Chairman H. Rap Brown of
SNCC spoke for the Black Stu-
dents Alliance, as he did for a
growing majority of black youth
across the country when he said:

"The lesson for us is very
clear and evident. If we seek re-
dress of our grievances through
peaceful and so-called legal
means, we will be shot down and
murdered.

“It Is obvious that the time for
marching, demonstrating, de-
manding, praying and petitioning
is over. If we must die, let us
die with the enemy's blood on our
hands. If we must die, let us die
like men, fighting back. We will
not forget the Orangeburg mass-
acre ve ."
