Rules of any organized contest
are agreed upon by the contestants
before the match, and each player
is to be restricted by those rules.
This condition exists whether the
contest is -a wrestling match, a
game of cards, or a student gov-
ernment election.

If a player is caught breaking

the rules he is usually punished.
, The wrestler looses points or for-
‘g feits the match; the card player
" could get killed; the student poli-
tician can lose on both counts and
upset the governmental system.
This is why referees are needed
.. to watch most contests.
; For their work and excellent
i‘ ,- job of overseeing the elections we
' must congratulate this year’s elec-
'. tion commission. These students
 I carried out the MYSKANIA) class
' ' elections and amendment referen-
dum in one of the most efficient,
honest, and competent manner this
University has seen.

The vigilence with which the
commission carried out the elec-
tions, (Le. watching the polls,
securing the ballot boxes, using
voting machines, keeping account
of all of the used and unused bal-
lots, and checking the students’
voting credentials) cannot be
overlooked.

Election commission should be
further complimented for being
able to draw to the polls twenty
per cent of the Student Associa-
tion membership despite the fact
that there was only one polling
place. The crucial twenty per cent
was needed to have a decisive vote
on the Constitutional referendum.

Members of Election Commis-
sion worked day and night last
' week to prepare for the election
and to insure that elections were
being carried without any unfor-
tunate mistakes. Special congratu-
lations should be given to Henry
Madej, interim election commis-
sioner and Gary Gold, interim
assistant election commissioner.
We hope future election commis-
sions will follow the example of
this one and prevent any scandle
from rocking the student govern-
ment.

It is too bad that election com-
mission must act as a referee

A Fair Game

among the candidates, but so many
other necessities are unfortunate.
When all contests are kept honest
then we know the one who receives
the most votes, makes his bid, or
Pins is one who wins. This is im~
portant to insure stability and con-
fidence in the game.

Call To Action

 

After indicating to his audience
that he would say nothing pro-
found, Dean Chesin, in his address
at the Inauguration Ceremonies
last Sunday, continued to raise a
very provocative and controver-
sial question.

He stated at one point that the

Election Campaigns?

 

The suggestion has been made
several times during the elections
of this past week that there is not
enough vigorous campaigning on
this campus for elective positions.
We strongly concur in this feel-
ing. When voters come to the polls
not even sure of what elections
are being held, something is def-
initely wrong.

Elections for this year are not
by any means over; in fact next
month voting for what we consider
to be the offices most important to
the interests of the entire student
body (Central Council and LAAC)
are to be held.

Central Council is considered, in '

part, an advisory board to the ad-
ministration of the University, and
as such they make recommenda-
tions on such concerns as the pro-
posed University calendar for the
following year, the boundary line
between a peaceful and non-peace-
ful demonstration, the campus
alcohol policy, and other issues
Which directly affect every student
on this campus.

At its meeting yesterday, Coun-
cil considered events to be spon-
sored next year with the money
provided through Student Tax. Per-
haps they adequately reflected the
student interest and perhaps not;
response to the program nextyear
will tell. But within this question
lies the meat for one hell of a
campaign.

Similarly, question of a referen-
dum, or rather lack of one on the
proposed University calendar
might be another campaign issue.
Lack of adequate publicity of con-
certs, mixers, speeches, drama-

tics productions, athird.Council’s
certainly extremely weak policy
statement on the general question
of drugs, the present campus alco-
hol policy, student representation
(appointed by Council) on Faculty-
Student Committees such as the
Bookstore Advisory Board, the
Committee on Residences, and the
Committee on Student Conduct, are
other possible campaign issues,
to mention only a very few.

LAAC is involved in such is-

sues of concern as closed doors
for open houses, quad or hall so-
cial functions, sign-in and out pro-
cedures, hours for frosh, lockers
for commuters, dining facilities,
linen for residents, all with large
question marks attached.
' There are issues; and campaigns
can be a great deal of fun. Ral-
lies for candidates are far from out
of the question. Heldlnthe Campus
Center, they might have a mixer-
type atmosphere, with alcohol
served if desired. Greeks may have
an edge in this field, but a group
of GDl's can match them any day
if they try.

However. plans for this type
of campaign must begin well in ad-
vance. We urge the Election Com-
missioner to open self-nominations
before the end of March to allow
for that time, and Council to am-
mend the Election Billif necessary
to permit at least two weeks of
campaigning.

We would like nothing morethan
to cooperate by extensive election
coverage, straw votes and other
publicity. But it depends on the stu-
dent body as’to whether we will
have an exciting two weeks on this
campus.

University is not the place for po-
litical and social involvement, but
for study and research. In view
of the increasing involvement of
college students in questions of
world affairs and internal civil
rights, this is indeed a startling
statement.

Chesin continued to draw an an-
alogy between the European and
Latin American unstable govern-
ments and political campuses and
our own stable government and
noninvolved colleges, intimating a
cause and effect relationship.

This relationship, if it is a
casual one, would seem to indi-
cate that only a docile, or rela—
tively uninvolved population can
produce a stable democracy.

The involvement of the univer.
sity student, the nation’s young
intelligetsia, in the affairs of
national importance is, we feel,
extremely necessary for the coun-
try’s future. Without such inter-
est and action in the field of
practical politics, the leaders of
tomorrow will know very little
of the running of our government.

If college students are encour-
aged not to take action on their
beliefs, they will, in all likeli-
hood, become part of the voice-
less mass of the American pub-
lic, uninvolved and seemingly un-
involvable.

In a nation searching for new
ideas, new interpretations and new
answers, the consequences could
be disastrous. With government
officials proclaiming everyday that
the college generation is the hope
of future America, how can an
uninvolved and practically unin-
itiated college population be justl-
fled.

We do not feel that a stable gov-
ernment requires a non-political
University. We recognize the pos-
sibility that students may become
overactive in the political sphere
to the neglect of their academic
pursuits; however, wise Use of time
can negate this possibility.

Only by being active can a stu-
dent continue to be informed on
the issues of the world; only by
standing up for his beliefs can
he learn to face opposition.

Friday, March 15, 1968

Abraham Flexner may be con-
sidered the father of the "mod-
ern" University in America. He
believed that the university must
be at once free, relevant, and "ir-
responsible" in its response to
social problems in its environ-
ment. “In this world rocking be-
neath and around us, where is a
theory to be worked out, where
are social and economic prob-
lems to be analyzed, where are
theory and facts to be brought
face to face, where is the truth,
welcome or unwelcome, to be
told, where are men to be train—
ed to ascertain and tell it,where,
in whatever measure it is pos-
slble, is conscious, deliberate,
and irresponsible thought to be
given to the task of reshaping
this world of ours to our own lik-
ing, unless first and foremost
in the university?"

Let us keep this in mind as we
bring this theory to bear upon
a closer and more immediate is—
sue. l have observed, of late, a
remarkable trend which seems
to be slowly increasing in mo—
mentum as it captures followers
and alienates otherwise loyal
friends. As a topic of conver-
sation, we are amazed to note
that it takes precedence over the
weather or the draft (whichsome
consider better left undiscussed).
It concerns a subject dear to all
our hearts; the defenseless and
somewhat misconstrued Albany
Student Press.

An informal poll taken among
the upper echelons of our stu-
dent body produced a variety of
replies, ranging from "It never
did come to life this semester,
did it? Who's controlling the oxy-
gen supply?" to a rather pointed
"Last semester I read the ASP
all through my Friday morning
logic class. Now, we collect as
many unopened copies as we can
find (it isn’t hard) and use them
to light the fireplace on Saturday
nights." It is indeed unfortunate
that the ASP must suffer the in‘
dignities of external criticism,
as well as internal dissatisfac-
tion, but the most unnerving part
of all is that much of the unrest
is well founded.

Perhaps we are being unjust in
a comparison of last semester's
paper with the present copy. The
disparity of quality leaves a ques-
tion: What could possibly have
prompted such a reversal?

For instance, let us examine
the front page of the March 8th
edition. . . The headline in the
upper right hand corner should
have carried the story of James
Whitney’s removal from the fac-
ulty. Instead, we are informed
of the rather uneventful informa-
tion disclosed at the President’s
weekly news conference.

One columnist, sorely missed,
relieved himself of his duties
when the editors reserved the
liberty of inserting key words in
order to “clarify” certain points
as his opinion. There may have
been a misunderstanding of the
role of a columnist as an organ
of opinion. The unfortunate col-
umn by-lines display yet another

shortcoming of the paper. T hey
are not only incoherent and often
illiterate, but redudant and dull
(I do not hesitate to include my-
self in their number). A few
weeks ago, one prominent journ-
alist remarked: ". . . but I'm
quite sure the majorityof stu-
dents don’t want their campus
degenerating into at Berkeley,
Antioch, or Harpur.“ While the
prospects of such a fate do not
appear to be at all imminent, I
would hope that a small minority
of students might welcome sucha
"degeneration."

    

It may be argued that no rela-
tionship exists between Flemer's
philosophy of the university and
the functioning of the ASP, but
i am sure that further inspection
will attest to the validity of the
association. A college newspaper
should increase communication
concerning questions of aim and
responsibility, as well as insti-
gate a lively exchange of ideas.
Many people are unabletoconsid-
er conflicting viewpoints, un-
aware that this conflict creates
deeper vision within themselves
and among their colleagues.

The Portside

by Carol Ann. French

 

 

lt constantly amazes me that
many people who begin by posit-
ing the need for self criticism in
our society end by saying "but,"
and in effect canceling the ad-
missions that any society, if it is
to remain truly free, needs criti-
cism. When criticism is left to
the "vested interests," it be-
comes no criticism at all,for the
vested interests will not effec-
tively criticize themselves: they
have too much tolose.ltdevolves
upon those of us in less known
positions to criticize it most ob-
jectively.

Review Of The New Righl Wing

 

 

After a week's vacation,lshall
return to what I love best —
name calling and irresponsible
journalism. So, to whom it may
concern: Hippie, commie, pinko.

That should please my critics . . .
I have gained a great deal of re-
spect for Dr. James Whitney.
When a man is willing to jeopar-
dize his job, and possibly his
career, for a personal moral
conviction, no matter what it may
be, and then assume the conse-
quences without wincing, he de-
serves kudos from any individual-
ist. One of the many troubles of
the hippie movement is that they
can’t sacrifice for what they’ve
been induced to believe with-
out crying from here to Mars
about it.

I understand that the Unwash-
ables are going to have another
demonstration against the evils
of the Armstrong Company. (The
Armstrong Company willingly
makes tires for jeeps in Viet-
nam). If Vice President Ky chew-
ed Double Bubble bubble gum,
they'd probably protest that cor-
poration also . . . But if I were
a member of the Unwashables,
I'd watch it. if they keep the
pressure on, a backlash may oc-
cur, and someone could get hurt.
That, as of now, is meant to
be a warning and not a threat.
Law-abiding American citizens
are sick of getting the dirty
and of the stick, while the law-
breaking Unwashables get to dirty
up the clean end.

A proposal is being made
among members of the left wing
in support of Governor Rocke.
teller. I really don’t know whom
I’d vote for. I haven’t been able,
as yet, to figure outthe difference
between a liberal Republican and
a moderate Denmcrat . . . If
the peace - lovers would sober
up for a few minutes,they'd real-
ize that they're the ones who
are causing all of our domestic
hostilities and anxieties. Or does
their philosophy only apply to
principle and not to action?

Really think white Americans
hate black Americans, hip? If
the militant Negro groups ceased
this overemphasis of hate and
let us have ashort, cool summer,
I guarantee that bigotry would

be cut by a sizeable percentage.
But if they keep preaching hate,
that’s all they’ll get in return.
I've been labelled by a few as
a bigot because I don’t want to
give anybody anything. By the
same token, anything anyone (this
refers to Mongoloids, Caucasion
and Negro) earns, should not be
stolen from him. The goal of the
left is some make, some receive
for nothing. The goal of the right
is all make, none receive for
nothing.

There was an unpublicized pro-
test last week as an Air Force

  

Many of the schools through-
out the country are given titles
which describe the major past-
times of their students. Miami
U. and Parsons are “party
schools," and similarly, Albany
State is a “Gross Out” school.

In making a study ofthe'fcross
Out," one finds it to be a two-
way affair. The active partici-
pant, usually one or more males
and one or more females, are
categorized as the "Grosser"
and the "Grosses" respective-
ly. By closely observing many
"Gross Outs,” one can see a
definite pattern in the pro-
cedure.

The "Grossee," participant
receiving the brunt ofthe“Gross
Out," establishes a good rapport
with the “Grosser.” When she
feels that she is ready to be
"Crossed," she leads him into
it by reciting one of the follow-
ing ambiguous phrases, or a
phrase similar to one of these
known as the “primary five.”

1. "It’s not that hard is it?"

2. “Are things coming along
all right?"

3. “Don’t beat
bush."

4. "How's every little thing?"

5. “I’ve got nothing to worry
about . . . it's in the bag."

The protest against Firestone
being on campus is based on
two arguments. The first being

1. So many pounds of red meat.
Saute a bit to retain character.
2. Potatoes. Starch adds body.
3. Onions. Variety is the spice

5. Herbs. Originality is rare and

0. Salt and Pepper. Those are
the conventional condiments of
aggravation.

Simmer in a closed stew pot,
a big white one. Amazingly
enough, the result is quite tasty
and even makes its own gravy!
Stew is one of the most nutritious
dishes in the world.

I regret that some of last
week’s comments may have been

V

misconstewed. The intent, as al-
ways, is not to produce indiges—
tion, but rather, to remove the
cover and investigate what hap-
pens in the cooking process be-
fore the stow is done.

point where he recognizes that
flying off the handle eventually
contributes to a more seasoned

Last week's exemplary point'

was that fraternities and sorori-
ties should contribute their good
taste to the volume of the stew.
Their zest should contribute to
the volume of the stew in full
proportional flavor.

To most hilly contribute Greek
support and participation in Uni-
versity life, fraternities and
sororities should fill their hous-
ing quotas as fully as possible.

In the creative process of
stew, a certain number of select-
ed herbs are recognized and
honored. Congratulations to all
the newly-elected members of
MYSKANIA, Alumni Board and
Class Office. Special thanks are

that they make tires. Tires are
installed on jeeps and the mem-
bers of the Rat Patrol are mer-
ciful murderers.

The second argument is that
Firestone encourages the Univer-
sity Community to train students
to be mindless drones of a large
corporation.

The organizers of the Dow
protest were angered when they
realized that there weren’t
enough bodies in the Hall to pre-
vent the entry of students who
wished to see the recruiter.

hold that the Marxist analysis
of our society is the correct one
in terms of defining accurately
the alignment of opposing forces
in the U.S. and in the world.

I shall be happy to debate this
position with anyone who does not,
simply mouthsomeone elsc'st
titudes and will offer serious,i..
telllgent, conceived alternatives.

But I wish rathertodefend par-
ticular objections raised by Mr.
Iseman’s article,nottodefend so-
cialism in general.

Regarding the campaign
pamphlet i gave him, 1 note that
he quoted it accurately, if not
contexteraily.

We do not support the right of
black people to achieve freedom
by any means they consider nec-
essary to attain it. We are not
pacifists. We recognize that this
system has, through two years
of racial and economic oppres-
sion, driven blacks to the point
at which many of them feel they
can no longer endure.

If they revolt violently,this ac-
tion is in reaction to intolerable
suppression. We unconditionally
support the right of black people
to their freedom. But we alsoad-
vocate formation of an indepen-
dent black political party which
will work to gain electoral power
to upset the existing power struc-
tures, Democratic or Republican,
wherever they are. This part of
our program Mr. Iseman did not
see fit to comment on.

Similarly, we recognize that
the history of the Vietnamese for
at least 200 years has been to rid
themselves ,of foreign oppres-
sors, the French, the Chinese
(in 1946), and now the U.S.

We unconditionally support the
right of the Vietnamese to self-
determination, the same right
we won — violently — in our
own revolution. We regard the
United States' attempt to exploit
Vietnam for its own gain - not
for the "freedom" of the Vietna-
mese as immoral and as one of
the attempts of capitalism to
maintain itself.

We will continue to criticize
this society as long as it econo-
mically exploits anyone; and we
will work for the day when such
exploitations ceases to exist.

A more explicitly detailed ver-
sion of our position will be of-
fered by Mr. Fred Halstead,
S.\V.P. candidate for the presi-
dent of the U.S., Sun., March 17,
3 pm. in Lecture room 3.

He will speak on “Vietnam and
the ’68 elections — a Marxist
view." The best way to learn
about “troublemakers, pinks and
commies," terms, by the way,
close to libell is directly from
the course.
