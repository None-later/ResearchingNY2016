‘Absurd Reference’

To the Editors:

Paradoxicelly, Mr. Steneler's
brief note to the editor (despite
his absurd reference to thef'Arab
p a") simply reaffirmed
the strength of the Zionist move-
ment in this country.

For, he himself admitted that
the article would "not hurt a
single Zionist in this campus."
We are quite aware of this fact,
for, immediately, you obiectedto
"such wide coverage" of Mr.
Abdullah's point of view in a
weekly school newspaper when
the Zionist in this country have
maintained nation-wide coverage
of their point of view, oftentime
to the exclusion of any true facts
in relation to this problem.

In answering your question,
"who is Mr. Abdulleh to warrant
two pages of headlines?" I would
like to say that as anAmerican
citizen end as a student of this
campus, he was simply exercis-

his right and privilege to

present his .point of view on a

controversial and sensitive topic
to the AMERICAN public.

To the Editor:

After reading yourarticle, "In-
visible Man On Campus," al-
though unclear as to the author’s

nion of the extreme and
"middle of the roader" groups,
one point was made very clear
—-both ehouldbere-examine their
positions. This article is one of
the rare cases in the ASP where
the writer made some construc-
tive rather then destructive
criticism. It was refreshing to
read a criticism of both groups
where the author's aim was an
insight into the possible bene-
ficial value of these struggling
groups rather then a hackneyed
attack on the “deplorable” ex-
cesses of the extreme groups
or the inherent apathy of ell
middlemen groups.

it is upsetting that so little is
written about the difficulties of
the middlemen as he strugglesto
"draw a little from the left end
the right." Being a middlemen
used to be praised, but tom
nearly everyone immediately

lumps on this person as being
either I) an ultrarcmservative
and fervent supporter of the stat—
us quo or 2) Just a sponge for
other opinions. It is true that
many of these middlemen don't
attack the problem for them-
selves but I believe that most
college students are trying to
create their own active middle-
men positions. Beceuse they
aren't taking pert in extremely
active positions doesn’t mean that
they're apathetic, but are rather
concentrating their efforts in
struggling with the turmoil end
extremes within themselves.
Thanks for a refreshing bit of
philosophy which made theASP’s
sting a little more pleesently
biting. “I shell leave it to my
reader's consideration whether
it is not much better to be let
into the knowledge oi one’s self,
then to here whet passes in
Muscovy or Poland." (Spectator,
March 12, Hit).

Reporter’s Duty

To the Editor:

A reporter's duty is to viewan
action objectively end to try to
avoid editorialieing when writing
an article. l consider myself an
honest reporter end tried my ut-
most to keep my opinions out oi
the article I wrote about the
speaker for the Student Faculty
Committee toend the War. There-
fore, I am going to express my
opinions here.

For those oi you who might
agree with Mr. Teegue, I wish you
luck, becausel don't see how any
one can be at peace with that
viewpoint of our society. I would
be afraid for my life every time

i saw a uniform. And for those of
you who disagree, it's toobed you
didn't hear the speech for your-
selves. I honestly feel that leven
toned down many oi his state-
ments.

But I'm getting away from my
point. l'm not going to arguewlth
his statements or ideas. Thatbe-
longs on the forensics platform
where we would both have a
chance for defense end rebuttal.
However, I'd like to point out a
few observations that I made
while at the meeting. My first
question concerns the type of peo-
ple in the Committee. In search-
ing for a description I finally
decided that, they were non-or-
ganisation's—[people trying to hold
an organization together. They
appear to believe that adminis-
tration and organisation are bad,
whereas, individualism end dis-
sent is good. In a way, they may
be right, but they're quite naive
about the whole thing. Early in
the meeting, I was struck by a
remark made by a member oi the
:ommittee. She had stated that
when she led attended the con-
vention of the Peace end Free-
dom party that she was quite sur-
prised to find these pemle fight-
ing with one another. In other
words, these were people who
seemed to desire an end to racial
end military problems, but who
constantly fought among them-
selves on nothing other then
racial grounds! "Cast the beam
from they own eye first"?????

One of the faculty members on
the committee stated in his class
that we must be willing to stand
1p end raise our voices in anger.
This was his idea of a demo-
cracy. However, the democratic
process, while allowing end even
encouraging dissent among its
members, primarily consists of
the .. " ‘ of an _. ‘
by the use of compromise. The
antiwar groups as well as the
pro war groups would be more
effectively aiding this country if
they were to minimise their dif-
ferences end search for areas oi
agreement. Protest demonstra-
tions in most cases serve only
to infringe onthe rights ofothers.
A democracy protects end re-
spects the individual end it is a
basic fallacy among demonstrat-
ors that the right to freedom oi
speech is the right to infringe
upon the rights of others.

Come to me on my level, with
logical arguments andl'll discuss
the point. Come to me as my
superior and accuse me of being
"cruel" end "debesed" endl'll
turn my beck end say nothing.

Agreement

To the Editors:

We would like to express our
agreement with the editorial on
pro-registration. As uppercless-
men, we know that there are cer-
tain courses which are impera-
tive for us to take before we can
graduate.

The general ideas expressed
in the editorial seem to assure
fairness for all, both upperclass-
men end underclassmen.

We seethe necessity, asupper-
classmen, to have priority of
courses in our major end minor
fields. The plan presented inlest
week's article takes this need of
upperclassmen into account,
leaving general requirements
open to ell. Rather then enacting
the administration's “free-for-
all" alphabet system, we feel
the system presented by the edit-
oriel is more favorable.

Sit-in Protest

To the Editor:

Concerning the SiHn Protest
oi the Dow Chemical Recruiter:
i adamantly agree with the per-
sms involved that protest, gue-
ranteed by the Bill of Rights,
is an effective means of forcing
a realisation of the problem of
war end inhumanity (specifically
the use of Napalm) upon ell.

The SDS end Student—Faculty
Committee to End the War have

their right to freedom of speech
end expression end assembly.
They can make speecheeandpass

'out all the pamphlets their print-

ing press can reel off.

But it seems only feirthat they
also allow others to express their
opinion. Herein lies the core of
democracy —- freedom to hold
end express an opposing view,
to seek alternatives, todisagree,
end not to be condemned for it.

Don't these people who deny
to others the freedoms they
clamor for themselves realise
they are being hypocrites? Where
do they find the right to prevent
their fellow students from exer-
cising their academic freedom,
their freedom of decision? They
are not and should not be the
self-appointed censor for the
whole university. '

A basic contradiction remains
unresolved. They mouth high-
sounding phrases of Democracy
and freedom. But they practice
the methods of Dictatorship and
compulsion.

Dictatorship hands out a de-
cision on a platter: “I, in my
superior wisdom, have made the
decision whet is best for you to
do." Democracy, on the con-
trary, leaves the freedom to the
individual. "It is up to you; you
have freedom of choice, freedom
of a decision nonocoerced."

They ignore this essence, this
basic principle — freedom of
individual choice end the right
to express a dissenting opinion—
which is inherent in our system
of democracy.

I propose that the Dow
Chemical Recruiter, however,
controversial the manufactures
of his company may be, hes a
right to his freedom of expres-
sion, a right to obtain that in-
formation, not to be obstructed
from ' ' _ with the recruiter
if he so desires.

It is every lndividual's duty
to weigh the pros end cons ofthis
situation, which necessitates lis-
tening with an open mind to
both sides of the argument. Only
in this way can a person freely
make up his own mind according
to our democratic heritage. That
is: if it is democracy end free-
dom we truly wish to preserve.

Correct Mistake

To the Editor:

It was very "thoughtful" of
you to write a note about the
headline to my letter on page 2
in the March 1 issue of the ASP.
But l felt it was not sufficient to
correct the mistake you made,
namely the word "Jewish."

It is about time, for those who
don't know yet, to know that the
Arab-Israeli problem is NOT a
religious one. The struggle of
the Arabs is against"Zionism"
and its "Aggressive Action" to
colonies the Arab lends into a
Zionist Empire. This struggle is
certainly not against the peqile
who believe in the Jewish faith.

0n Whitney

To the Editor:

Assistant Professor of Mathe-
matics James N. Whitney recent.-
ly lost his job because he refused
a pledge of allegiance to the state
and the federal constitutions, a
reason backed by the Supreme
Court. As aresult, there is some-
thing lost by the students of
mathematics, by the student body,
by the University, evenby society
as a whole. Because Whitney
doesn't went to become, in effect,
a “yesman” to the constitutions,
law says he can't keep his Job.

I admit that I don't agree with
everything that he stands for, but
he still hes every righttobelieve
in it; end he believes that our
governmental systems are not
without major flaws. His aim,
is to create an awareness in the
student body of some of these
flaws or misused loopholes. Many
students agree with him; those
who don't will argue their views
and are thus further aware of
them. Moral philosophies of all
kinds are, then, encouraged,

Since society doesn’t like dis-
section (although it insists the
opposite), many students are
further affected in their academic
education by the loss of a valu-
able teacher. Had Whitney agreed
to sign the loyalty oath, he would
have been fired on the grounds of
violation of that oath. So society
has a damaging legal way of
stifling dissention.

Whitney may or may not be
right in his views, but he should
still be entitled to express them
without such a binding restric-
tion. No teacher should be re-
quired to sign a loyalty oath.
Although I'm not entirely surel
have presented my position
accurately or adequately, I don't
hesitate to support Whitney in
this particular action and in his
right, even as a teacher, to dis-
sent. It is entirely unfairto many
peqele, directly or indirectly in-
volved that such a law as forcing
the “loyalty” of teachers should
exist. Rosalie Valvo

If second helpings are de-
signed, the students on Colonial

way to do this is to ask for only
the type of food you want. If
they are serving a vegetable you

that you don't want it instead of
taking it and throwing it away
later.

One can assume that many
if not most Americans conclud-
ed their viewing of “The Rise
and Fall of the Third Reich”
with a horror-tinged sense of
conplacency. After all the Car-
mans are no longer killing Jews
(one must overlook the fact that
the main reason for this new
German tolerance might well be
that they have already success-
fully i’lnlshed the job, in Europe
at least) and it did not happen
here. Americans might oven feel
with some pride, that we wont
to war to save those persecuted
minorities from Hitler.

The sad fact is that the vic-
tims of German tyranny did not
at all figure into Washington’s
calculations when we entered the
war. President Roosevelt knew
of Hitler's planned genocide but
would not allow this knowledge
to be publicized. Roosevelt felt
that he could not permit the
American people to believe that
we were going to war to save
a few million Jews, of all
things. Nor could he allow Jew-
ish refugee children to immigrate
here and upset the labor market.
it is a euphemism to say that
America stood by while six mil-
lion died; America might well
have signed their death warrant.

The reasons for this are re-
latively simple. The state De-
partment is today, and always
has been unashamedly antl-
Semetic. It does not matter who
occupies the White House; the
State's attitude is unchanging. It
has consistently foisted upon this

And yet the lsraelis have no ally
in the State Department. The men
at the Department of State seem
to buy wholesale the hatefilled
Arab propaganda.

And so seemingly does Rich-
ardson Rice (Dean of the School
of Social Welfare), Ryland Hewitt
of the Speech Department and
Paul Bruce Pettit of Speech and
Dramatic Art. These three are
among eleven faculty members
who have banded together to pro
vide "a smell voice to the voice-
less" (Le. the Arabs).

Though they claim to be non-
partisan, they charge the U.S.
with being callous to the needs
of the Arabs. Rice was quoted
in the "Times-Union” as say-
ing that he is appaued at the
way Americans "bleed for the
Israelis." He said that he will
not feel "compassion at the ex-
pense of a larger people." Thus
the brilliant Rice theory that
might does make right. And one
does not expect him to "bleed"
for the victims of Auschwitz,
Dachau or Bergen-Belsen.

I suppose that it is relatively
easy for Rice, Pettit or Hewitt
to accept the Arabs somewhat
insane world view. They each
spent a great deal of time in
the Arab capitals and were fed
a steady diet of anti-Semltic
propaganda by their hosts. But
one does expect much more from
any individual who makes some
pretense to objectivity.

We must not forget that the
Arabs have for twenty years
warned the civilized world that
they were about to "crush and

  

’\\

 

 

 

Now at one time anti-Semitism
was quite fashionable. Today it
is no longer and the semanti-
cists of hate have come up with
a phrase more palatable in the
post-Hitler world. The Jew-
haters now call themselves “anti-
Zionists" but the product is the
same. This anti-Zionism was
manifested last week when the
State Department censured
Israel for destroying the home
of an Arab saboteur in Jeru-
salem. However, never during
the past twenty years did we
hear a word of rebuke from
the State Department as Arab
guns opened up on Israeli bord-
er settlements or as Arabs de-
secrath Holy Places in Jersu-
salem. Never a word of protest
when Arab plans to utilize gas
chambers on the civilian popula.
tion of Israel were unveiled after
the War. During the Six Day War
when 94 per cent of the American
people strongly supported our
only ally in the Middle East,
the State Department was “neu-
tral in thought, word and deed."
This despite the well-known fact
that during the Second World War
the Jews of Palestine fought in
the British Army while the Arabs,
under their beloved Grand Mufti,
backed the Nazis with a zeal
Arabs only display when they
see the prospect of killing un-
armed Jowish civilians at hand.

demolish Israel" and that their
slogan has been “Perish Judea."
The Arabs are not talking about
border readjustments. They are
talking about genocide. Let us
not forget that the Arabs have
disregarded every Armistice
agreement and that even today
they refuse to negotiate.

The Arabs have ignored every
international convention on the
protection of Holy Places. Where-
as Israol, in the retaking of
Jerusalem, suffered her heaviest
losses because her troops were
not permitted to use the artillery
fire that might damage religious
shrines; the Jordanians used
tombstones from the Mount of
Olives to build walls, they used
Jewish holy sites as latrines.
Whereas Israel grants Christian,
Moslem and Jew equal access to
Holy Places, the Jordanians dur-
ing their mow permanently ended)
occupation of the City of David
permitted no Jew access to the
Holy Places of his faith.

The Israelis have regained
their City of Jerusalem and be-
cause of this, it is open to all
who wish to worship there. Once
more, this most holy of cities
is an international one.

Yet our State Department calls
for Israeli withdrawal. This is
adequate enough evidence of its
anti-Semitism. The fact is that
anti-Semiilsm and anti-"innl-m

 

are one and the same. The
anti-Semites policy is to kill
Jews; the anti-Zionists merely
won't allow them to live. Those
who deny Israel's right to exist
are, in fact, calling for the re-
activation of the gas chambers
and they well know it.

Let the anti-Semites stand
warned. We see through your
camoilauge; we see your hate
propaganda for what it is. And
the Arab students who are utiliz-
ing their stay in this country to
propagandize for the vicious
regimes of their home states may
note that they are here at the
sufferance of the United states
government.

They might better devote them-
selves to the improvement of the
conditions of their fellow Arabs
at home than to fomentingracism
and deceit here. Despite any on-
couragement they might derive
from the attitude of the Deparir
ment of State, they might remem-
ber that the bond of friendship
between the oldest democracy in
the world and one of the newest
has existed for twenty years and
will not be broken even by the
well-financed propaganda lobby
of the so-called Arab League.

A funny thing happened to us
the other day which we thought
we would relate to you.

We were sitting in the snack
bar arguing as usual with some
of our friends about the war,
when this guy comes in and
tells us that he has all of the
answers.

He was wearing long blond
hair, aboard and sandals.

"Well," we said, "what do
you suggest? That we just stop
fighting?"

"Thou shalt not kill," he said.

"That's nice to say, but how
is one supposed to act against
nasty Communists?”

“Love thine enemy," he said,
"Be kind to he who doth thee
wrong."

"Sure, sure," we chorted,
"but what kind of policy is that
:og take again'st tu force which

grosses age ns our troo 8
ships in Vietnam?" p and

"Ye have heard that it hath
been said 'An eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth," he
said, "but I say unto you that
ye shall not resist evil: but who-
soever shall smite thee on the
ruightfheek, turn to him the other

50.

Just about breaking out into
total laughter, one of us scream-
ed out, “But these commies
threaten our way of life! A com-
mie takeover means the end of
the American standard of liv-
ingl Color TV, cars, apple piel”

“Ah,” he said, "It shall be
easier for acunel to pass through
the eye of a needle than for a
rich man to enter heaven."

At this point, someone threw
a coke at him yelling, "You must
be one of those peaceniksl”

“Blessed are the peace
makers; for they shall be called
the children of God."

“You ought to be thrown in
Jail," we screamed hysterically,
“you treasonous SOB. Along with
the rest of those hippie trouble-
makers who refuse toaerve their
country!”

"Blessed are those who suffer
persecution for righteousness
sake: for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven."

It was at this point that one
of the crowd which had gathered
around stepped forward. Before,
members of the crowd had
limited themselves to yelling
"Bomb With Ban,” and "Kill
For Peace." The one who came
forward said he was from a
group called Youngsters for

"We are different than you
liberals," he said. “We have the
ability to think logically and ob-
jectively." That was when he
hit the long haired guy in the

 

 

I'd like to recount for you
an exchange which was record-
ed on one of the men's room's
walls in the Campus Center last
week; a written excerpt from
the apparent thoughts of a hawk
and a dove.

“Why don't people ever pro-
test against Viet Cong terror-

ism and merciless killing?”

"Because we can’t stop it."

"That justifies it?"

This exchange makes a subtle
point against the people who only
protest against our involvement
in Vietnam; they are ignor-
ing half of the present situation.
This is a convenient way of say-
ing, "1 know what I think, don’t
confuse me with the facts."

What can we do about this?
There are many things which we
can do, and the present situa-
tion is pointing out the fault
of our way of solving the prob-
lem today. The future lies not
in withdrawal and placation,
World War II showed that, but
nor does it lie in the fight for
total victory. The answer is
hidden in people to people nego-
tiation, contact between indivi-
dual ways of life on a face to
face basis.

If we are right in what we
are saying, and trying to do,
then education of our "enem-
ice” is the answer — not their
destruction. If we are wrong,
we should learn from them, and
adapt our system. The first step
in this direction is a negotiat-
ed peace between the warring
forces, and then a drop in trade

I don't mean to condone war,
but I strongly suggest that con-
sideration of the whole picture
is necessary before an individu-
al comes to a conclusion, pro

Who should carry the blame
for the war in Vietnam, us or
them? Neither, only people in
general; no matter where they
live, they tend towards violence

events 01 May and June, 1967. In
spite of the enormous hate pro
paganda issued over the radio
by Arab states and in spite of
the assurance that Israel would
be annihilated by the massively
armed Arab nations, they re-
mained loyal and steadfast to
their Jewish fellow citizens. I
will not go into detail to describe
to what lengths Israel has gone
to provide for the cultural and
religious integrity oflts minority
communities and the equal shar-
ing of the improved living
standards that Israel provides
all its citizens.

We are told that the Jordan
River has been fouled by the
dumping of saline water into it.
If indeed the waters have been
fouled it must have been Jordan
that fouled them.

The Jordan River, according
to the boundaries existing prior
to June l967, runs for a short
stretch ihroughasparselyseitled
part of Israel when it empties
from the Sea of Galileo and then
runs for a much longer stretch
through Jordan occupied terri-
tory.

The story of Syrian and Jor-
danian obstructionism in rela-
tion to plans for water conserva-
tion in that part of the world,
where water is such aprecious
commodity, is too long to go Into
here but these reports are avail-
able to any interested reader.
Here again as in every instance
the Arabs will cut of their hoses
to spite their faces.

If a plan will help them and
at the same time be of benefit
to Israel, it is rejected.

Lest an one think that the

 

    
 

 

mouth. Just then everybody Join-
ed in kicking and hittingthe funny
man, who just moaned and re-
fused to fight back.

“You weak swine," he was
called.

“Blessed are the meek; for
they shall inherit the earth,"
were the final words which he
whispered Just as the last nail
was driven into his palm.

ggression, Destruction

shores of the Sea of Galilee have
been profaned let me urge all to
visit and see for themselves. The
lovely church on the Mt. of Beatl-
tudes stands in splendor on me
shores of Galilee, the Church of
Peter and many others are beauti-
fully preserved.

If any profanatlon occurred it
was the result of Syrian shelling
from the Golan heights over the
eastern shore of the Sea. I saw
with my own eyes dead cattle,
the result of one shelling Inci-
dent Iast Spring; and the children
I visited in one settlement were
taught anu cared for in bunkers
to protect them from the ruthless
and inexcusable shelling.

The letter concludes "Surely
Israel ought not to be allowed to
thus enjoy the fruits of its aggres-
sion." Israel is for the firsttime
enjoying the fruits of Arab ag-
gression and hostility In the form
of more or less secure bound-
aries.

All that the Arab nations need
to do Is to treat Israel with the
same respect that they expectand
get from others and such bound-
aries will no longer be a necessity
for Israel. After all Israel did
not dismiss the U. N. forces from
the Sinai; Israel didn't close the
Gulf of Aqube; Israel did not de-
ploy massive armies armed with
2 billion dollars of Russian equip-
ment on its neighbors' frontiers;
Israel did not shell the city of
Jerusalem; Israel did not bom-
bard the settlements on the shore
of Galilee.

How come Israel didn't become
involved militarily with Lebanon?
Could it be that Israel does not
disturb a neighbor that doesn't
molest it? Israel knows how to
live at peace with its neighbors.
Do the Arab states know how to
live at peace with each other and
Israel?

If the citizens of the world
were to be aroused for the citi-
zens of Jerusalem, they should
have been aroused twenty years
ago when Jordan annexed the city
and all of the West Bank without
authority or a shred of legitimate
claim.
