The Jimi ll_cniirlx Exurience

 

And The Beat Goes On

 

 

 

lav John DeMorco

I mean physically shook.l think
I'm quite safe in assuming that al-
most everyone on this campus
has, in one way or another,
"blown their mind." But, i doubt
if many have ever feltthelrbones
shake. Well, that is the secret
of one of the most powerful groups
in pop music today, the Jimi
Hendrix Experience. it’s aprlml-
tive movement that literally
shakes the ground you stand on.

Circa 5,000 eyes, hungry for
the sight of something about to
come out from behind the cur-
tains. it seemed that they were
just filled with madness, and
waited only for a sign from the
man on stage to start a massive
riot. All eyes were now focused
upon the striking .figure in the
black stovepipe pants, a guitar
strung from his slight shoulders,
a Spanish dancer's hat covering
his wild roots, and a cigarette
clinging to his lips.

Coolness, if ever ' anyone was
cool. "Ye all dig," the figure
demanded. "Yeah," echoed some
2,000 times in the hall. "Fire."
Suddenly l was experiencing the
Jimi Hendrix Experience, a very
much alive and amplified trio
that has stationed itself securely
in the higher echelon's oftoday's
pop scene.

"Let me stand next to your
fire," cried the lyrics of their
first number, "Fire," a song
that left the audience burning.
The whole place now belonged to
Jimi Hendrix, and he knew it.

immediately the group went in-
to their next song, " Please Crawl
Out Your Window," a Bob Dylan
song, done in a unique manner
by Hendrix, with a great deal of
amplification.

Among shouts of requests, the

 

Joe," a well known tune that was
incidentally their first single.

Then, came the real show
stopper, "Foxey Lady," a hard-
drivlng song, with a pulsating
sound and beat that never seems
to stop working on the listener.
Hendrix began to show his stuff.

To describe the exciting guitar
playing style of Jimi Hendrix is
no easy task; you almost have to
see him to believe its possible.
We like a little dog going after
a big bone, as Hendrix seems to
spring attacks upon the guitar,
seizing strongly, and then letting
go. His left hand seemed to
possess magic as ltswept across
the strings, electrifying the au-
dience.

His style is unique. and it
takes a little time to realize that

every part of Hendrix is tied up
in the guitar hanging from his
wire frame.

it’s not unusual, for instance,
to see Jimi head into a lead part
stroking with his teeth, or sud-
denly cross-over his fingering
position, or run his elbow up
the neck, producing definite
chords, or even to see him play
under his legs orbehind his back.
With Jimi Hendrix anything is
possible.

The other members of the
group, drummer Mitch Mitchell,
and bass player Noel Reddlng,
are not to be overlooked. They
provide the driving foundation
for Hendrix’s unique guitar, and
were it not for them Jimi might
not be able to obtain his" special
ground."

The School of Library Science
in conjunction with Faculty-Stu-
dent Association will present
Jean-Luc Godard showing and
discussing his latest film "La
Chlnoise" on March 21, 1968 at
7:30 p.m. in Page Hall.

Godard, who has been describ-
ed as the most movie-conscious
of directors, was born in Paris
in December 1930. He studied at
Nyon (Switzerland), the Lycee
Bufion (Paris), and the Sorbonne
(Certificat d’Ethnologie, 1949).

His first articles on film ap-
peared in 1950 in Gazette du
Cinema and in 1952 in Cahiers
du Cinema (under the pseudonym
of Hans Lucas). Whileworklngon
a dam construction site in
Switzerland, Godard shot his first
film, "Operation Baton," in 1954.

From 1956-1959 he wasaregu-
1ar contributor to Cahiers du
Cinema, one of the leading voices
in the group of young critics
(which included Francois Truf-
faut and Claude Chabrol) who be-
came directors and caused a
revolution in the French film in-

dustry. Godard is still an
occasional contributor to Cahiers
du Cinema.

Since " Breathless, ” which was
shot in Paris in the late summer
of 1959, Godard has made 14
feature films.

A film critic at the Venice
Film Festival writes that “La
Chinoise," which will be shown
by Godard in Page, "eclipses all
other films. it makes them appear
dull, routine, obsolete. Its brilli-
ance is moreover notdueto some
aesthetic or technical innovation;
simply, what we must call
Godard's "manner" finds here a
certain completion and fullness."

Raymond A. Sokolov from
Newsweek reports that "God-
ard’s work is extremely im-
portant. For younger directors
and audiences as far away as
Tokyo, Godard's anarchic, un-
settling films have captured the
racing pulse and raveied pattern
of chaotic time. And with any
luck, Godard will have many more
years to practice the art about
which he has said is truth 24
times a second."

‘Peter Wotkin’s “Privilege”

Films

by Dave Bordwell

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pop culture is frightening
sometimes, but if you think it
has a fair chance to take over
the world, you'll like Peter Wat-
kins' "Privilege" (Cinema Art
Theatre), which, like his earlier
"The War Game," is set in the
Britain of the supposedly near
future. it is about a pop singer
who in the hands of the Estab-
lishment becomes a tool for draw-
ing off public energy which might
otherwise trickle off into more
dangerous channels — like non-
conformity.

Again like "The War Game,”
"Privilege" is structured like a
documentary. The characters re-
late incidents directly to us upon
prompting by an unseen narrator.
Much use is made of handheld
cameras interspersed stills, and
available light, though the handl-
ing is slicker than in the previous
film. However, 1 don't think this
narrative style works too well.
First, the documentary approach
is used inconsistently. Some-
times the characters are aware
of the camera's presence; other
times, during high - level ex-
ecutive meetings and lovemaking
scenes, we know the documentary
camera could not be around,
and the inconsistency is jarring.
Moreover, the sore spot of “The
War Game" -— heavyhanded nar-
ration -— fosters here. For exam-
ple: "All that Steven Shorter has
Just done has been to express
the desire to be an individual.
But that, in an age of social con-
formity, can be a social prob-
lem.” True enough, but such in-
sistent obviousness makes one
wonder whether the “Documen-
tary” contrivance has not made
for too easy a solution, to the
director's obligation to reveal
theme and characters in some
depth.

The opening sequence prom-
ises some excitement. Stove
Shorter's return to England is
greeted by Britain's first ticker-
lﬂPe parade. Then a mob of
shrieking teeny - hoppers watch
Steve in a grotesque skltinwhlch
ho is beaten and imprisoned by
cops, all the while pleading in
song for help and sympathy. lit
the close of this ritual Steve is
whisked off to a dressing room
where the ofiscroen narrator
points out the principals among
Steve's rotinuo.

Unfortunately, this opening
Gives the whole show away, and
from here on Watkins moron
rings variations ——- some ingen-
ious, most tiresome —— on the
situation he has already dis-
Plﬂyeti. There is no real plot
propulsion: the depiction of

- a. I...

Steve's desire to break out of his
role is sketchy, rambling, and
repetitious.

The stylistic flatness and the
plot»pnralysls yield characters
which are glossy,shaliow cliches
of contemporary types— the non-
conformlsi girl artist, the show-
biz parasites, the hip clergymen.
And the flimsiness of the inter-
personal relations is reinforced
by the embarrassingly inadequate
performances of everybody. Now
Paul Jones' playing of Steve
Shorter is crucial: he should
ooze charisma, yet still bear
marks ofan entrapped soul.Jones
gives us the last hair, all right
— lots of soulful stammerings
and tight-llpped wincing — but
the charisma Just isn’t there.
During his big acts, he looks
even the impassive attrac-
tiveness of, say, the Yardbirds
in "Blow-Up."

"The War Game" show-
ed that Watkins has talent; now
let's see him put it to work in
a film in which he has no social
or political ax to grind.

Stamp out apathyi Get
interested, get involved, do some-
thingl The word is communica-
tion.

Every Wednesday evening at
7:30 p.m. in the Humanities Fac-
ulty Lounge, there is an open
student group discussion on the
Message of Modern Music. The
group leader VickiSwigert,a stu-
dent here, is an avid fan of
pop music. She uses tapes of
selections from Simon 8: Car-
funkel's "Parsley, Sage, Rose.
mary and Thyme," the Beatles'
"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely liearts
Club Band" and "Magical Mys-
tery Tour," Peter, Paul 8: Mary's
“Album 1700," and dilios the
lyrics to facilitate discussion
and annlysls.

The refreshing thing about this
discussion series is that its pur-
pose is to stimulate an exchange
of ideas amongr interested music
uificionndos, and no one, not
oven Time Magazine, holds "the
right" interpretation. 0! course,
the success and continuation of
this group is dependent upon stu-
dent interest and student particl-
puiion, not student apathy.

Bob Dylan's album, “John Wes.
ley Harding" will be the next top.
ic of discussion. it will be a well
spent hour!

Intermedia‘Brings Paik and Riley To

1NTERMED1A '08 beginslts
second week of programs with
performances by two internation-
ally known composers and a mix-
ed trio of writer-director, minis-
ter - composer, and choreogra-
pher-teacher.

INTERMEDIA '68 is sponsored
by the New York State Council
on the Arts. The State Univ. of
N.Y. is presenting this series
of arts programs during the
month of March in order to ex-
pose new experiments and theor-
ies in all the art forms to a stu-
dent audience.

Nam June Paik, who will per-
form in the Art Gallery of the
Fine Arts Building at 8 p.m.
on Saturday, March 16, is a
Korean-born composer with radi-
cal, new ideas. ln his composi.
tions he has invoked the theories
of John Cage, Norbert Wiener,
and Marshall McLuhan.

Paik believes that music must
blend with art and become vis-
ual particularly through the use
of electronic equipment. The
cathode ray tube will replace the
canvas. Someday artists will
work with capacitors, resistors
and semi-conductors."

Paik has also stated that”Var-
iability and lndetermlnism is as
undeveloped in optical art as
Parameter Sex is underdevelop-
ed in music.” Celllst Charlotte
Moorman, who will be appearing
with Paik, has helped the com-
poser demonstrate this ldea in
a recent concert.

 

Paik has participated in elec-
tronic constructions, intermedia
presentations, programmed tele-
vision, and music-oriented hap-
penings. One of his more fam-
ous compositions is entitled:
loga Cage — 3.5 McLuhan
+ - sorry. Norbert Wiener

Self-taught composer and mu-
slcial Terry Riley will also ap-
pear in the Art Gallery, with his
performance scheduled for Tues-
day, March 19, at 8 p.m. Riley
is a Master's graduate in music
of the University of California at
Berkeley.

The music of this revolution-
ary composer "deals with (a) de-
velopment . . . built on related
patterns through the use of live
instruments and sequential taped
repetitions presented in live con-
cert situations."

In the summer of 1967, Riley
was commissioned by Swe-
dish Radio to compose and con-
duct 9. work for teenage orches-
tra. Following this, he toured
Scandinavia. His most recent ap-
pearance was at the Philadel-
phia College of Art in the per-
formance of an 81/g-hour "A11-
nght Flight."

The "Judson Church Group,"
consisting of Remy Charllp, A1
Carmines, and Aileen Passloff,
will perform in the Art Gallery
at B p.m. on Wednesday,
March 20.

Remy Chaer won the "Obie"
(Off-Broadway) Award for the

direction of Ruth Krauss's “A
Beautiful Day." He has directed
numerous other plays (having
written some himself) and has
also worked as a choreographer,
actor, dancer and set, costume,
and make-up designer.

The Rev. Carmines is a com-
poser and won the 1964 "Obie"
for best music. The third off-
Broadway play for which he has
composed the music is Gertrude
Stein’s critically-acclaimed "in
Circles," still playing at the
Cherry Lane Theater in New York
City from an October, 1967
opening.

Aileen Passloff is a dancer,
choreographer, and teacher. For
nine years she has been head of
her own dance troupe, with whom
she has performed both in New
York and on tour. For three
years she has taught movement
for actors at Stella Adler's Thea-
ter Studio.

Charlip is head of the Chil--
dren’s Theater and Literature
Department at Sarah Lawrence
College. Al Carmines has been
associate minister and director
of the arts program at the Jud-
son Memorial Church since 1961.
Miss Passloff and Charlip have
worked together as performing
team for the past four years.
