Shaving Cream And Junh

by Harriett Liner
and Lynn Edwards

The airport looked nodifierent
that it ever does on a weekday
afternoon. There were relatively
few people at Gate 7; a few
businessmen were on their way
to Boston but, aside from one
or two photographers and report-
ers, that was it. An American
Airlines flight from Detroit was
in and the passengers startedex-
lting from the plane. Along with
:he other travelers, six young
men, looking very fatigued but
excited, left the plane. They
were Ted Bluechel Jr., Brian
Cole, Russ Giguere, Terry Kirk-
man, Larry Ramos, and Jim
Yester-«better known as the As-
sociation, one of America’s best
singing groups.

After a few minutes of flash-
bulb popping and hand shaking,
the boys very calmly entered
the airport and headed toward
the baggage area. Drummer Ted
Bluechel Jr., the member of the
group that fans refer to as “the
cute one," stopped to talk to us
for a few minutes.

He began to speak about the

‘Big Print’ Show

Winners Chosen

The Art Gallery of the Uni-
versity has awarded purchase
prizes to seven prints in the
Big Prints Show now on exhibit
in the gallery. Selections were
made by Miss Una Johnson, cur-
ator of prints and drawings at
the Brooklyn Museum.

Prize winners are New Mexico
printmaker Garo Antresian’s
color lithograph, "010;" a lucite
engraving entitled " Predator 11”
by Patricia Benson, a member
of the art faculty at FloridaState
University; "The Crowd”by New
York artist Gerson Lelver; Gabor
Peterdi’s color lntaglio, "Arctic
Bird," Robert Rauschenberg's

lithograph, "Booster Study," a.

color woodcut, “Fonte Limon”
by Carol Summers; and Homes
Viesulas’s color lithograph,
"Yonkers."

Gallery director Donald Mo-
chon, commenting on the selec-
tion of purchase prizes, said,
“Miss Johnson’s prize selections
are excellent prints, repre-
senting a broad range of styles
and techniques. They will consti-
tute a valuable edition to the art's
department's growing print col-
lection."

The national invitational ex-
hibit is composed of 94 prints
by 47 artists. it will continue
in the gallery through March 24.

group and its image. He feels,
that some individualism tends to
become lost if one becomes part‘
of “a group.” “it's diffith to
throw six fellows together and
not have them project some sort
of image." To help avoid this,
the members of the Association
try to appear as separate in-
dividuals when performing. They
tend to wear the same type of
clothing, but refuse to wear a
"uniform." Wearing the same
outfit can give rise toanother
problem for “in the event, as
an example, that we plan to wear
grey suits and one guy splits
his grey pants, we're messed
up. '

The Association cares a great
deal about the type of per-
formance that they give. “Up on
stage we definitely think a bit.
We draw upon a feeling to each
guy in the group and to each
one in the audience. . .we try
to project a feeling." They get
a thrill out of doing concerts
for college audiences for they
enjoy “communicating” with col-
lege students. But, as Ted said,
they “can’t just go out and per-
form. First you've got to get
‘hot’; it would come off lake.-
dasical if you didn't.” They also
feel that the timing of a show is
very important. "if a guy gets
hung up tuning, it will kill the
pace." To change the pace 9.

New Art Exhibit

In Patroon Room

An exhibit of sculpture by
John Cunningham and paintings
by Jon J. Moscartolo opened
March 6 in the Patroon Lounge
of the Campus Center. The show
will continue through Thursday,
April 4.

Mr. Cunningham, who holds de-
grees from Kenyon College and
Yale School of Art and Archi-
tecture, was assistant to George
Rickey for two years. In 1963
he was commissioned by Paul
Rudolph, architect, to restore
and cast the Louis Sullivan or-
nament for Art and Architec-
ture Building at Yale.

Mr. Moscartolo, an alumnus
of Dartmouth College, held the
Dartmouth General Fellowship
for Advanced Study in Painting
at San Francisco Art institute
and Cranbrook Academy of Art.

He has a master of arts de-
gree from Rhode island School
of Design. His work has been
shown at Hopkins Center Gal-
leries, Hanover, N.H.; \Vheel-
cock College, Boston; Lamont
Gallery, .Phillips Exeter Ace.-
demy of Design Annual Exhibit.
Currently, Moscartolo is in-
structor of arts and director of
Hawthorn Gallery, Skldmore.

ments, the Association tends to
break up their concerts with
short skits.

The boys had been very polite
and courteous and spoke with a
high degree of intelligence. It
takes a group like the Associa-
tion to make one forget about
some of the second and third
rate singing groups that take
advantage of the public and give
such a poor picture of today's
youth.

They were about to leave and
pick up their baggage (Ted says
he carries two suitcases, “one
with stage clothes and one half
filled with incense, fruit, shav-'
ing cream and other junk") when
Ted answered a question about
the future. He began by speak-
ing about today’s gurus. He said
"They do a lot more good than
some other people. They have
their ‘shtick.’ A lot depends on
the guru." As for tomorrow
"It always depends on the youth."

Campus Center Art Works

 

A chess set, The Beatles, Alfie,
these are the subjects and in-
spirations for the art works on
display in the Campus Center
right now.

The sculptures by John
Cunningham are being shown in
the Patroon Lounge, which is
located past the information Desk
and to the right. These forms are
unusual and different in their
shape; it’s hard to describe, but
most of Cunningham’s works are
tall, thin, and have a sort of
scallop effect. The "King" and
"Queen" are obviously com-
panion pieces since they are very
similar and the analogy to achess
set is so obvious. The pieces
are made from a white resin
which, along with their shape,
makes the sculptures reminis-
cent of this campus.

“Mullebrlty” (from the Latin
word for woman) i suspect is
a little work set in one of the
corners of the Patroon Lounge.
It is much like the others ex-
cept that it begins to bulge at
the bottom with several bulges
which are suggestive of a woman's

breasts, with one major differ.
once: there are about two dozen
swellings.

i said before "i suspect" that
this piece of artlSHMuliebrity."
i really can’t tell because even
though there is a nice, little
sheet containing the names of
the sculptures with a number
preceding the name, someone
neglected to place these numbers
on or near the carvings.

Jon Moscartolo's work is re-
presented by paintings which are
both sensual and colorful. “Hos-
pital Trust," which is in the
Patron Lounge, is a good ex-
ample of this. it is done in
blues with very subtle shadings.
Moscartolo's use of line is ef-
fective here. “Kiss” is a well
done painting in red withaclever

ing is the sign shown at the end

Reverie

of a drive-in movie, Please re-
move speaker. . .The lines in
this painting, the various shades
of red, the series of concentric
squares super-imposed on the
picture of the couple embracing,
all these contribute to making
this an interesting picture.

Also in the Patroon lounge is
Moscartolo’s “Help.” This quite
naturally contains portraits of
the favorite four. the Beatles.
This is well done and colorful,
it gives the impression of the
mood that surrounded the Beatles
when they made the film “Help.”
There is also something inter-
esting about his style here; it’s
not too obvious which Beatle is
which but the impression comes
across.

Around the Campus Center bal-
cony, i.e. the area on the second
floor which surrounds the foyer,

 

also contains paintings by Jon
Moscartolo as well as a few
sculpures (for lack of a better
name) and montages.

“Turn, Turn, Turn" and
“Blueberry Cove” are examples
of junk sculpture. (At least that’s
what they impressed lne as
being). Oh well, you can’t win
’em all. The others in this area
are interesting in a different
way from the paintings in the
Patroon Lounge; these are more
abstract for the most part, and
Moscartolo depends more on ills
use of color than that of form or
line as in the others.

it would be nice however if
the show could be located in
one place and also if the art
works could be labeled so you
could tell what you were looking
at.

Wrestlers End Season

Led By Clark, Springer

by Tom Nixon

The Albany State wrestling
team ended its season last week
with only one victory in a season
of eleven matches. They did, how-
ever, flnlsh second in their own
invitational at the start of the
year.

The team's performance was
upset throughout the course ofthe
year by various injuries and drop-
outs. During the season, three
different wrestlers gave up the
sport, one graduated, one trans-
ferred, another was hindered in
his performance because of a
painful injury and still another
was forced to sit out the final
two matches because of an injury.

The 123-pound spot was shared
by Eric Watts, Jack Forbes, Bill
Russell and Alex Domkowski.
Watts started the season for Al-
bany and registered two decisions
and one pin before suffering a
pinched nerve in his shoulder.
Jack Forbes wrestled once at123
and gained a draw. However, he
was ll second semester senior
and graduated before he had a
chance to wrestle again. Bill
Russell took over and gained a
pin, and suffered a loss in the
matches before Watts returned.
Watts gained two decision v1c-'
tories, one at 123 and one at 130
before he dropped off the team.
Alex Domkowski filled his spot
for the last four matches, butwas
defeated each time that he
wrestled.

Gary Smagalski, Bill Clark and
Alex Domkowski all saw action
for Albany at 130 pounds.Smagal-
ski started the season at the spot
and recorded only one pin in four
matches before he dropped off
the team. His spot was filled
temporarily by Alex Domkowski
who gained a decisionvictoryand
was also decisioned ill two
matches. For the remainder of
the season, BillClark wrestled at
the l30-pound spot and recorded
two decision victories and one
draw in six matches.

Clorlt Impressive
The 137-pound spot was shared
during the year by Bill Clark and
George strylchak. Fran Weal

also wrestled once at this weight
spot but he suffered aloss. Clark
started the year at 137, and in the
six matches in which he partici-
pated, he recorded four decision
victories and one victory by apin.
These wins, along with those he
received at 130, gave Clark
twenty-five points for the year.

Fran Weal held down the 145-
pound spot for Albany on all but
one occasion. Craig Springer
participated once, and lost a de-
cision to his opponent. Weal, in
ten matches managed togain only
one pin and one decision vie,
tory.

Craig Springer wrestled the
whole season, except for one
match at 145, for Albany at the
l52-pound spot. During the course
of the year, Craig recorded one
pin, six decisions and one draw
for twenty-five points.

The 160-pound division was
shared throughout the year by
Frank Berry and Dave Lambert.
Berry wrestled the first six
matches for Albany and was able
to tally only one pin and one de-
cision. Lambert was less
successful as he recorded only
one draw.

At the 167-pound spot, Mar-
shall Gladstone went the entire
year without a victory. Dave
Lambert wrestled once at the
position, but he also was un-
successful.

Gotham Injured

Roger Gorham was one of the
wrestlers forced to quit because
of an injury. Gorham wrestled
the first nine matches until he
suffered a broken nose and was
forced to sit out the last two
matches. While he wrestled,
Roger gained two pins, three de-
cisions and one draw. Gorham
also had the quickest pin of the
year when be pinned his opponent
from Brooklyn Poly in 1:40 ofthe
first period.

The heavyweight spot for Al-
bany was held by Roger Saul for
three matches before he trans-
ferred. in the three matches,
Saul recorded a pin and a draw.
in all other matches, except one
when Gladstone wrestled, Albany
was forced to forfeit the heavy-
weight spot.

The Luck Of The Irish
Doesn’t Aid These Men

by Butch McGuerty

1n the early hours of Saturday
morning, a small band of deter-
mined men pace toward an en-
gagement with destiny. steadily
they proceed over the podium,
into the bowels of the Campus
Center, into the bowling alley.
For it is in the bowling alley-
ways that they will be tested by
the unrelenting foe. Casting off
their jackets, there they stand,
a force to be reckoned with, the
irish All-Stars.

The record of these bowling
heroes testifies to the steady-
ness of their game, 0-56 for the
first semester; 7-21 for this
semester. But these sevenpoints
were foul, they were begotten
when the All-Stars had to step
aside, one of those misty morn-
ings and receive a bye. The
irishmen refuse to recognize the
existence of these foul seven
points.

The men who bowl on such a
team represent, in every way,
the potential danger that they
possess.

The lead-off man is Captain
Bill Blain, a horrendous bowler
of ill-repute. Bowling through
the purple haze cast in front of
him by his adversaries, he sets
the example that all the All-
Stars are happy to follow. Bowling
a powerful 123 average against
the perennial favorites, the Bad
News 5 and Potter Club, he can
usually be seen slumped in his
chair awaiting his next ball, or
leading the team in Obscenities.

The next man to throw is the
best defensive player on the
squad, Phil (Fuzzy) Galvin. Bowl-
ing everySsturday, his average of
123 is the complement ofCaptain
Blain’s, helping to set the torrid
All-star pace. Considered by
most observers the best defen-
sive player, Fuzzy continually
luneses the opposition with
stellar shouting tactics, driving
opponents into a manical frenzy.

Third on the throwing list is
the sparkplug of the team, the be-

loved Moravian, Butch McGuerty.
A bowler whose absence is often
felt, his average of 147 provides
a constant threat to theopposi-
tion. Forever encouraging (and
amazing) his teammates with
Moravia stories, his coursgeand
determination help the All-Stars
over the light spots that frequent-
ly develop.

The clean-up, and strongest,
man on the team, is Danny Moran.
Throwing right and left hooks
with equal vigor, he knocks the
pins many times using the one
ball trick (using one ball instead
of two for ten pins) to obtain the
highest average, 149. Frequently
seen slumping with Captain Blain,
Danny proves his mettle time and
again, delivering for the A11-
Stsrs 1n the clutch. Forever quot-
ing the encouraging phrase, " Vic-
tory is sweet," he is the All-
Star's defense against the secret
weapon, and is always on hand
for the ritual of the ripping of
the score sheet.

The fourth man, the best all-
around bowler on the team, is
Mike Brennan. ldolizing Moran
and Galvin, Mike possesses a
sizzling 135 average and is con-
tinually falling back on defense to
assist the stalwart Galvin. Al-
ways seen with a silly grin on his
face, he is frequently heard
giggling over an opponents poorly
thrown ball.

Filling out the near perfect
roster of the Allstars are two
individuals that need nointroduo-
tion, Jim Henley and Mickey
(Thing) McMahon. Healy is con-
tinually pressed into service to
replace the ailing Blain, Moran,
McGuerty, or Brennan, helping
the Allstars with a 120 average

good defensive bowling
tactics. Thing is also a valuable
possession as he holds a .000
average and completes the
roster.

To the irish All-Stars, con-
gratulations on your past
triumphs, and good luck in the
future for the men with stars on
their sleeves.

Shafts, EEP Meet Sat.
LeagueLead In Balance

The Shafts temporarily took
over first place in League 1 as
they increased their record to
35-0 this past week. EEP, who
was tied with them did not bowl
and thus dropped down into second
place for the time being. The
important battle comes this week-
end, however as the two leaders
meet each other lnahead-tohead
battle to determine who will take
over first place.

The Shafts have the league
leader in average as Giles has
maintained an 186 average for
the season. EEP has been led
throughout the season by Cud-
more with 182 and Piotrowski
with 177.
