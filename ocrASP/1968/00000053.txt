Chairman Reese

Oi“ Philosophy
Has New Plans

by Herb Greenlriott

Dr. William L. Reese has be-
come the new chairman of the
Philosophy Department. Reese
came to Albany from the Uni-
versity of Delaware, where he
headed the Philosophy Depart-
ment. . .

Reese has dreams as well as
plans for the Philosophy Depart-
ment. “What a department be-
comes depends upon everybody
in the department,” according
to Reese.

As for a projected doctoral
program in philosophy, Reese
says: “Dr. Creegan(former head
of the department) has done
most of the work. i think Cree-

n has done very well by us;
the question is will we do well
by him."

One of Reese’s dreams for
the University is a center for
interdisciplinary study. The
Princeton institute for Advanced
Studies and the Wesleyan insti-
tute of Advanced Humanities are
cited by Reese for their achieve-
ments, however, he pointed out
that 'they are essentially out-
side the structure of curri-
culum."

Reese feels that a center
'should have on-going seminars.
The center would serve as host
to ‘var onle from var .
ous parltgsusofpl’he world,’ and
'bring together people in the
forefront of their communica-
tions."

in the words of Reese: "We
have to put philosophy where the
action is. The problem is how
to do that. in some oi the de-
cades of this century, phiIOso-
phy has painted itself into a cor-
ner. The question is how you
define the role of philosophy."

Reese believes that ‘in addi-

tion to the standard people, (ex-
perts in ethics, epistemology,
etc.,) there should be interdis-
ciplinary personnel."
Reese feels that the philosopher-
phsychist, philosopher - human-
ist, and philosopher - social sci-
entist will be a replacement for
the inert, book-bound system."
Reese terms his concept of
philosophy as ‘responslble gen-
erallzation.”

On a Ford Foundation fellow-
ship last year, Reese toured
South America, interviewing ex-
perts in various fields at the
rate of 25-30 people per week.
Reese contends that the Latin
Americans follow a French hu-
manistic tradition that is alien
to U.S. culture. One coursethat
will be added next year is Latin
American philosophy.

Reese foresees an integration
of philosophy with social science
with our graduate schools of so-
cial welfare, criminal justice,
and public affairs. He cites
Clark Kerr's contention that ‘an
attempt to investigate the inter-
faces of knowledge will 'make
more of a university out of the
multiversity."

Reese thinks that despite the
achievements of schools such
as Harvard and Yale, such
schools dominate studies with
“vested interests." Reese cites
the declaration of Chancellor
Gould: “We are limited only
by the fertility of our imagina-

Whitney Signs Oath,

Continues To Teach

Professor James N. Whitney
oi the University Math Depart-
ment signed the oath of office re-
quired of all state employees Fri-
day morning when it was present-
ed to him by Vincent Cowling,
chairman of the department of
mathematics.

He had been removed from the
University payroll because he
had refused to sign the "loyalty
oath" when asked previously.

Whitney, stating his reason for
signing the oath at this time, in-
dicated that “this issue is less
important than others." Furth-
er, he stated that by staying at
the University as a professor he
would "be in a better position
to carry out activities against
the (Vietnam) war and against
circumstances which would per-
mit this kind of a war."

The fact that he has "a source
of income" and, in addition, "free
time to devote" to his activities
Whitney mentioned as other ad-
vantages of his position as apro-
lessor.

Whitney had stated, in a letter
to Dr. Eugene McLaren, chair-
man of the division of science
and mathematics, dated February
23, 1968, “The circumstances
in which i am being asked to
sign the oath show clearly its use
as an instrument of political in-
timidation.

“l was not asked to sign the
oath when I was hired presum-
ably because by a clerical error
it was not sent to me.”

Pelton Discusses Functions

Of End War Committee

by Linda Stoszok

Dr. Leroy Pelton of the Psy-
chology department at the Uni-
versity spoke at a recent meet-
ing of the Faculty Committee to
End the War in Vietnam. The
lecture was concerned main-
ly with the Teachers'Draft Coun-
seling Committee of which Pel-
ton is a member.

The committee is made up of
approximately 90 members,
about one-third of whom are coun-
selors. The rest are supporting
members.

According to Pelton the com-
mittee has two functions. First,
it gives out information about all
possible alternatives to the draft
and second, it acts as a sound-
ing board to help the student
organize his beliefs about the

Pelton also discussed the vari-
ous alternatives to the draft.
The first one is to be declared
a conscientious objector. in or-
der to gain conscientious objec-
tor status a person should be
against all war not only the Viet-
nam war. “The important thing
is to have a consistent set of
beliefs."

Pelton feels that one of the
possible outcomes of the com-
mittee will be to make conscien-
tious objection respectable which
is important since "everybody
needs some kind of social sup-
port."

The second alternative that
Pelton mentioned was immigra-
tion to Canada. A person can-
not be extradited once he gets
to Canada but Pelton stated, “As
far as i can see there's no hope
of ever coming back."

Another alternative which he
mentioned is a five year jail
sentence and a $10,000 fine.

 

 

 

 

group working entirely withinthe

Legislature wondered whether
some faculty members had not
signed the loyalty oath."

Whitney had announced his
availability as a draft counselor
in a letter to the editor dated
February 1 saying that he advo-
cates draft resistance.

He was arrested during the
demonstration against the Dow
Chemical Company on Wednes-
day, February 21, just after the
time he was first asked to sign.

in the same letter or Febru—
ary 23, Whitney wrote, "notc-
that the question of the loyalty
oath was first raised publicly
when a faculty group started
draft counseling, that lwas first
asked to sign after announcing
my encouragement of draft re-
sistance, and that the ‘discovcry’
that I hadn't signed, was made
shortly after my arrest.

Gould Against

OutsideInterferers

NEW YORK (CPS) — Samuel

Gould, Chancellor of the State
University of New York, recent.
ly warned against outside inter-
ference in universities.
Gould was speaking particularly
about the recent raid on the uni-
versity’s Stony Brook campus in
which 30 students were arrest-
ed on charges of marijuana pos-
session in the middle of the
night.

"if the university is to spunk
honestly it must remain pillll-
ically unencumbered," Gould
said. “Thoughtful people every.
where have become disiui'lwri of
late over the possibility that uni-
versities may increasingly lu-
snhject to pressures that hayr-
nothing to do with education but
have much to do with the momen-
tary surges of public passion.

30 per cent more waste neat. . .
than conventional plants." Be-
cause of this, large fresh water
areas might be used for nuclear
cooling, but, Daddario stressed,
no one knows what the ecological
results will be. There were many
similar examples given and all
lacked information of the results
that might be produced.

Daddario reaffirmed his be-
lief that promotion of immediate
research in all fields of ecology
is necessary “to any future life
of quality.”

To help with these problems,
Daddario commented on how col-
leges and universities can help.
He suggested that centers such
as the one at this university could
help by alerting the public to the
many threats that technological
development brings.

Secondly, with "competence in
technology and public affairs,”
the answers, that are developed
to solve some oithe problems re-
sulting from technological ad-
vancement, should be put forth
with vigor. The answers result-
ing from the study of the prob-
lems should not just be talked
about, but acted upon.

A third way, Daddario continv
ued, is by having the universi-
ties "take the lead or help. . .
in the development of a theoreti-
cal ecology. The situation ls such
that this type of discipline is de-
finitely needed."

The final way that Daddario
states as a possible way that uni-
versities may help with the prob-
lems of technology, is by a change
in "the techniques of learningand
in attitudes towards it." Learn-
ing, Daddario stresses, must be-
come important to people and not
just a necessary thing to do to
be able to earn more money. Peo-
ple must begin to see that learn-
ing about technology and its even-
tual effects can make this world,
a world of quality.

These suggestions may seem
next to impossible to accomplish,
but, Daddario stresses, these
solutions are necessary. Many of
the troubles in today's world are
a direct result from "our tech-
nological brand ofmaterialism."
Along with the universities, Con-
gress is alsotrylngtosolve some
of the threats of "the hidden
war." Daddario stated that many
congressmen are becoming more
and more aware ofthe critical na-
ture of the problems resulting
from the advancement oftechnol-
ogy.

in the subcommittee, Daddario
said that strong efforts are being
put forth "to develop new meth-
ods of assessing technology, and
particularly a capability within
the Congress to gauge correctly
where we should place our sup-
port for applied science."

Daddario concluded his lecture
using a quote from Roger Revelle
which summed up the congress-
men’s feeling on the subject of
“the hidden war." it was, “Our
goal should be not to conquer
the natural world but to live in
harmony with it.”

   
Speaks On Vietnam war

 

by Vic Loopor
Sta/l Re artcr

Fred Halstea , the Socialist
Workers Party Presidential can-
didate, who spoke at the Univer-
sity Sunday, March 17 statedthat
the reason for our involvement
in the Vietnam War according to
the Administration was that ifwe
don’t stop them there we will
have to stop them here and the
Tonkin Resolution.

He stated that the first argu-
ment has been rejected by a
large number of people including
some Generals. He questioned
this argumentby asking whocould
we fight.

Halstead said that we would
obvi0usly not fight the Viet-
namese, or the Chinese because
there are no Chinese tr00ps any-
where outside of China. This is
in definite contrast to the United
States which has troops all over
the world.

Arguing that fighting the Com-
munists was the problem accord-
ing to the myth perpetratedby the
administration Halstead declared
that this argument is ridiculous
because the Communists are a
race and not an ideology.

He believed that the second
argu ment advanced about the Ten-
kin Resolution had a “ring of
truth." He said that the reason
the Tonkin Resolution was pass-
ed was because it was supposed-
ly vital to the Americaninterests
to maintain stability in South
East Asia.

Halstead stated that the cause
of the war was U.S. imperialism.
He criticised U.S. corporations
for exploiting the countries that
it enters so that a few large
American corporations can make
money.

This to him was the prime
reason for our involvement in
Vietnam. He believed that it was
not worth it for 20,000 men to
get killed so that a few people

F iser Resigns,
Resume Teaching

President Evan R. Collins has
announced the resignation of Dr.
Webb S. Fiser, vicepresidentfor
academic affairs, effective
September 1. Fiser, a professor
of political science who has been
serving in his present capacity
since 1965, plans to return to
teaching and research.

Fiser said that at the time he
acoepted the position of vice
president for academic affairs at
the University he indicated to
President Collins that he had
some unfinished academic work.
it was understood that a request
to resume teaching and research
in his professional field was a
possibility. He is on the faculty
of the Graduate School of Public
Affairs.

in commenting on his decision,
Fiser said, “i have greatly enjoy-
ed my term of office as vice
president for academic affairs.
Working with the Albany faculty
and administration has been a
genuine pleasure; however, i have
not had much contact with stu-
dents. 1 look forward to rectifying
that situation in my new role."

Prior to coming to the Univer-
sity, Flser taught at Syracuse
University and the University of
Detroit.

important trade routes of anti-
quity, probably the routebetween
Egypt and Damascus, which ran
along the western shore of the
Sea of Galilee.

The site was first occupied in
the middle bronze age about 1500
B.C7.Vand also has Mycenaean,
Acharmenid, and‘liell'enistic lay-

much promise.

The Director of Antiquities in
Israel has given his permission
for the excavation, and Israeli
counterpart funds have been
assigned to the project by acom-
mittee of the Smithsonian in-
stitute in Washington, D.C.

Plans have been completed by
Professor Mary Goggln, chair-
man of the Classics Department,
and Professor John Overbeck to
go to lsrael in late May for pre-
liminary digging and also to make
preparations for more extensive
excavations in the summer of

could get rich by selling ‘wer
materials and by exploiting the
raw materials of the country.

Halstead also states his views
on the amount of social protest
in the country as compared to
former times. He stated that
there is more social protest than
ever before.

The two reasons for this were
the depth of opposition by the
leaders of the country such as
Sen. Wayne Morse, William Ful-
bright and Eugene McCarthy. He
seriously doubts the sincerity of
Sen. Robert Kennedy due to his
actions taken during the Mo-
Carthy ere.

Halstead and his running mate
Paul Boutelle are the only can-
didates to call for a unilateral

 

 

withdrawal from Vietnam and
that fully support the Black Power
movement.

' The other reason was that
since they could not agree am
themselves about the war, they
could not agree on how toweakea
the strength of the anti-war dis-
renters.

The audience of about 50 were
urged not to take their protests
off the streets into the Demo-
cratic party where they would be
controlled and co-opted.

Haistead urged a large vote for
him on the upcoming Choice '68
college primary and a large vote
against the war on the referen-
dum. Halstesd was given astand-
ing ovation by about half the
crowd.

Council Approves Budgets

(Continued from Page ])
Revue. The one tlmwas removed
by Council vote involved the
spending of SA money for a De-
bate coach.

ln the Dramatics Council bud-
get there were riders stating
that SA members must be able
to purchase tickets at least three
days in advance of the general
ticket sales, that no season tick-
ets may be sold and that there
will be strict enforcement of
the Student Tax Policy due to
prior infractions.

The riders were put on for
various reasons of prior viola-
tion of policies and exploratory
moves to seek information. if
these riders are not followed,
Finance Committee can revoke
an organizations budget, as de-
cided by Council at a previous
session.

The meeting which started at
7:30 lasted until 12:10. Members
of various organizations were in
attendance to defend their bud-
gets, especially lf they had ask-
ed for large increases.

The debate was marked by a
great deal of cross questioning
of the budgets to ascertain the
meaning of various terms, the
reasons for appropriation of spe-
cific funds and motions to in-
crease or decrease various lines
in presented budgets.There were
four motions made that increas.
ed the total budget amounts and
one that decreased 'the amount.

Council also had a short dis.
cussion about the Arab Club bud.
get, State Fair and Campus Car-
nival, (these events are current-
ly non-bud eted).

An amen ment to eliminate All-
Unlversity Reception's (Talent
Show) income line was defeat-
ed, after the measure was strong-
ly opposed by Student Tax Com-
mittee.

Traditionally, the Reception
has been free for both SA and
non-SA members. The members

of the Tax Committee felt that
there should be a price levied
for non-SA members. Maintain.
ing the income line will force
Reception to levy such a non-
SA price.

The budget process is a long
process which begins about Do-
cember and involves a number
of levels of SA.

For example, the Holiday Sing
budget was prepared by this
year’s Co-Chairmen. it was then

and forwarded it with approval
to CPC.

The Commission held hearings
on the budget at which time mem-
bers of the Board were asked
to appear and defend the amount
of the proposed appropriation.Af-
ter Commission hearings, the
budget was then sent to Budget
Committee where it was further
debated and scrutinized. Board
members also appear and testify
at these hearings and the Com-
mission representative gives his
support to the budget.

After these intensive hear-
ings, the budget is sent to Cen-
tral Council for its final vote.
By this time the budget may
have been increased from what
was originally asked for but it has
usually been decreased.

Council usually passes most
budgets as presented without ad-
ditions or subtractions.’l‘he num-
ber of levels a budget has topass
