Ask For Changes In Draft Law

WASHINGTON (CPS) — Ten
members of the House Special
Education Subcommittee have
asked President Johnson and Sec-
retary of Defense Clark Clifford
to take steps to lighten the im-
pact of the loss of draft defer-
mente on graduate students.

The group made no specific
proposal but asked for "a sys-
tem of selection which will die-
tribute the burden equitably
among all available men in the
eligible manpower pool.” How-
ever, Chairman Edith Green (D-
ore.) and severalother members
of the subcommittee, have gen-
erally favored a plan that would
make lS-year-olds the prime age
group, along with college grad-
uates.

Under the present regulations,
almost all draftees after June
will be college graduates.

The subcommittee also sent
a copy of the resolution toChair-
man L. Mendel Rivers of the
House Armed Services Com-
mittee, who had earlier made the
same proposal in a letter to
Selective Service Director Lew-
is Hershey.

in the petition the subcom-
mittee noted especially the im-
pact of the loss of deferments
on higher education. The sub-
committee became involved in
the draft question when it was
considering a group of federal
programs to aid graduate schools
and students.

The subcommittee had also
considered calling Secretary
Clifford to testify on the draft
problem, but apparently decided
against it.

The resolution was approved
by all ten of the 15 subcommit-
tee members who attended an
executive session on Tuesday.
They include six Democrats and
four Republicans.

Besides Mrs. Green, Demo-
crats who signed the petition
included Frank Thompson

(N .J.), John Brademas ()lnd.), Wil-
liam Hathaway (Me. , James
Scheuer (N.Y.), and Hugh Carey
(N.Y.). Republicans included Al-
bert Quie (Minn.), Ogden Reid
(N .Y.), Marvin Esch (Mich.), and
John Erlenborn (11].).

The Senate Armed Services
Committee passed a bill that
would have left much of the re-

form to the discretion of the
President. However, the House
Armed Services Committee
changed the Senate-passed bill,
adding many restrictive provi-
sions. The most significant re-
striction prohibited random 59.
lectlon, although it gave the Pres-
ident power to designate a "prime
age-group" for the draft.

RabinOWitch Intruduces , 7

New Center For Science

Given the task ofdescrihing the
general characteristics of the
Scientific Revolution, Dr. Eugene
Robinowitch, speaking at a con-
ference Monday morning at the
Thruway Motor inn discussed the
revolution in relation to man and
society.

We are, he indicated, in the
midst of numerous crisis (war,
poverty) and everyone is concern-
ed with the immediate events,
and not inclined tothink creative-
ly of the society that will emerge
from these crisis.

Feeling that everything will be
all right if the war ends and
poverty in the cities is solved is
not enough. Finding a way of
ending all wars, and the injustice
of poverty within plehty as
aspects of our society is the
primary concern.

A stable and permanent peace
involving all mankind in a
common advance toward a more
worthwhile existence without the
division of the rich elite and the
poor masses ls anessentialgosl.

Along with the evolution ofris-
ing expectations, said Rabino-
witch, revolutionary methods of
communication have developed.
Because of the realizations of
other modes of living brought out
through communications, the
modern man, so exposed to other
cultures, cannot return to his
isolated life forgetting the other
way.

Questioning the effect offittlng
the American social and scienti-
fic technology to traditional
forms of American existence,
Rablnowitch suggested that more

could he accomplished by anon-
tioning how the framework oiaiir
society can be fitted to the
Scientific Revolution, how to re-
form and revise national and
international life to make them
fit in with the Revolution.

This reformation, he indicated,
is necessary to prevent us from
being swept aside by the technical
revolution.

The revolution in science has,
said Rabinowitch, brought about a
change in the consciousness of
mankind; it has changed the status

of man in the universe and in
man's attitude toward himself.
. Man has always thought ofhim-
self as holding the central posi-
tion in the universe despite om-
formation of the Copernican
theory. The idea is thatbeginning
to permeate human conscious-
ness now is that man is only a
very small part of this universe.

This general philosophical
change in man's view of himself
and society is an essential aid in
tackling the problems that arise
with the Scientific Revolution.

Dr. Klempner Author,
Book Result Of Study

Dr. Irving M. Klempnel, I830
ciate professor, School of Li-
brary Science at the University,
is the author of a book just pub-
lished by The Scarecrow Press,
Metuchen, New Jersey. The
volume, “Diffusion of Abstract-
ing and indexing Services for
Government - Sponsored Re-
search," assists in the assess-
ment of the role played by the
federal government in dis-
seminating information about
government-sponsored research.

Klempner's work is the result
of a study conducted while hewas
at Columbia University. The
volume analyzes the effect for
scientific and technical informa-
tion on national economics and
corporate enterprises.

Before joining the faculty at
the University last September,

Klempner was manager of in-
formation services at United Nu-
clear Corporation, Elmsford. He
holds degrees from Brooklyn Col»
logo and Columbia University
where he received his doctorate
in library science.

Klempner's study is based on
data assembled for the total U.S.
recipient population, including
detailed questionnaire responses
from a representative sample of
over 800 recipients of the serv-
ices.

Current U.S. information dis-
tribution policies are reviewed
and recommendations are made
in light of the research findings.
A related study is made of the
production and distribution of
abstracting and indexing serv-
ices in the U.S.S.R. andanumber
of Soviet block countries.

REVOLUTION"

FEDERAL SCHOOL REPORT says: The Phila-

delphia public schools are engaged in "the most dramatic
revolution in a city school system in the post-war perlod."
Reform in Philadelphia is "more widespread and far-reaching
than in any large school system in the country."

DR. MARK R. SHEDD, new Superintendent of Schools, says:

“I will continue to support teachers who are able to examine, in a
mature way, the gut issues at our day—war, sex, race, drugs, poverty.
It we divorce school subjects from the guts and hopes of human beings,

we can expect students to find them gulless and hopeless."

RICHARDSON DILWORTH, President at the Board of Education,
says: “The city is where the action is. It's where the challenge is. It's where
we are taping the great moral and social issues of our day. If you want action,

come teach in Philadelphia. If you don't, go teach in the suburbs."
