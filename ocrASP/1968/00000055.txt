Pub Where Joyce "Wrote ..

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

To Be Sold By Auction

by Vincent Tobin

Newsmarker -on-Fergus, Ireland

SHANNON. AIRPORT, Ireland
— Literature lovers around the
world have heard of Mulligan's
Pub in Dublin and James Joyce,
the controversial irish writer,
who made it famous.

To most Dubliners, however,
Mulligans has been just another
pub, and the fact that James
Joyce was, for years, a regu-
lar customer there and wrote
part of his most important work,
Ulysses, in a smoke-room off
the bar, has done little to dis-
tinguiah it from a thousand other
pubs throughout the city. For
James Joyce, amongst his own
people is very much a prophet
withoul honour. But last week
Mulligan's Pub in Poolbeg Street
became a conversation piece.
Not amongst lovers of litera-
ture or Joyce fans but for busi-
ness men. .

For the old premises is due to
come under the auctioneer's ham-
mer on March 21, and its loca-
tion beside the quays, in a
congested area of the city,'makes
it one of the most coveted pieces
of real-estate in Dublin.

What will happen to Mulligan’s?
Will it go the way oi the fine
Georgian terraces in Mountjoy
Square and Fitswilliam street
that were razed last year to make
way for twentieth century steel
and concrete office blocks?

Will one more feature of ire-
land's past be swept away in the
country's rush towards prosper-
ity? One can almost here the
ghost of another Irish writer,
Oliver Goldsmith, quote from
his immortal poem "The Desert-
Village" "l'll fares the land to
hastening ills a prey, Where
wealth accumulates and men de-
cay."

Mulligans of Poolbeg street
has looked out upon nearly two
hundred years of life in Dublin.

Mexican Poor Seen
In A ‘Twlight Zone’

by Perl Piuillo

Rotary Foundation Fellow

Mexico is not so “American-
ized” as one is told. Once out-
side of the large cities (Mexico
Ciw and Guadalajara for ex-
ample) one sees Mexico from
more than a tourist's point-of-
view.

Also, Mexico isn't complete-
ly a country of "obliagados"
on horseback as many believe.
(Writing from an American point-
of-view, i am accustomed to the
prescence oi alarge middle class
which seems to be lacking here.

I often use the word “twilight
zone" in describing Mexico; i
believe the poor see none of this
“progress.” What isnt' con-
trolled by the government, is
owned by foreign powers (mainly
the United States and British

interests.)
The "official party," the PEI
anstitutlonal Revolutionary

Party) is run as a Tammany-
like machine. The PR1 police
and federal forces, besides sup
porting the opposition parties
(which, of course, never win),
control everything in Mexico.

The class system is morehlat-
antly evident here than in the
United States (Mexico has econo-
mic discrimination rather than
social discrimination). With its
second-class buses, trains, res-
taurants, and wages, los pobres
are easily identified.

Brazil are the other two), if
not the leader, you begin to pray
for other countries.

But Mexico certainly has a
popular attraction which is
proven by the thousands who re-
turn every year to Mexico owl:
a tourist also sees "surface Mex-
ico"; to me, to know Mexico
you must have a certain feeling
for it).

To say it is a beautiful coun-
try is an understatement. The
Mexicans of past centuries have
permitted the culture brought by
the Spanish, Mayan, and other
Indian cultures toremainand per-
meate Mexico. The numerous
pyramids, temples, pottery and
paintings reinforce this point;
from this perspective, the Max-
ican is a gifted individual.

In more recent times it has

the barman by asking for ice—a
commodity not often' requested

in Mulligans.

As young actors at the Abbey

both customers and the raucus
voice of Brendan Behan was of-

He was of course referring
to Joyce. As the old man fell

befitting monument to an eccen-

be quite forgotten while people
continue to read James Joyce.

Contact lenses can be
heaven . . . or hell. They
maybe a wonder of
modern science but just
the slightest bit of dirt
under the lens can make
them unbearable. In
order to keep your con-
tact lenses as comforta-
ble and convenient as
they woredcsigned to be,
you have to lake care of
them.

Until now you needed
two or more separate
solutions to properly pre-
pare and mainlain your
contacts. You would
think that caring for con-
tacts should be as con-
venient as wearing them.

THE DEPARTMENTOF SPEECH and Drama has sponsored
this year, among its octiviiies, “The Adding Machine."

Speech,Drama To Move
To New Arts Center

by Laura Silverstein

The Speech and Drama De-
partment will be moving next
year to the new Performing Arts
Center, on the opposite end of
the Podium from the library.

This complex Is reputed to be
one of the finest theater train-
ing facilities in the world. Dr.
Paul Bruce Pettit, chairman of
the Speech and Drama Depart-
ment, has been told this by sev-
eral major international archi-
tects at a meeting in Prague
where Pettit presented the blue-
prints of the building.

The Centre will consist of live
theaters. One will be specifical-
ly for music, the main stage will
be shared by both music and
theater. The remaining three
theaters will be employed by
theater only.

Next fall several new courses
will he offered. These are: Strind-
berg, lonesco and Genet, the
Dramatic Art of the Romantic
Period, Broadcast Production,
and Film Production.

The Speech Pathology and
Audiology Department is rapidly
installing an audiology lab which
will include a sound-proof room,
major testing equipment, etc. The
department is striving to pro
does one of the finest research
and training facilities in New
York State outside of New York
City.

A Ph.D. program in Drama-
tic Art should be prepared by
1072. The Radio, Television
and Film department will have a
second phase of courses for a
second degree in the depart-
ment.

The Rhetoric and Public Ad-
dress section will begin a li-
brary of significant speeches in
national and in' ernationai events.
This way students will have the
opportunity to observe directly
the way in which great speak-
ers speak.

The theater section is enter-
taining the possibility of an in-
ternational program with an op-
tion in foreign study. There will
be summer and year-long pro-
grams thut will bcavailnblo with-
in the next two years.

This year, as Pettit says, is
really just a matter of house-

stration. To be sure, he was ask-
ed to step down from the wit-
ness stand and identify Whitney
who was sitting among the spec-

tors.

Connally stated thatbefore any-
one was arrested they were told
they had ten minutes to leave
of their own accord.

After this ten people were ar-
rested.

Harvey began the cross exam-
ination of Connolly by asking
him to explain the University pol-
icy that was violated by the de-
fendants.

Connally was forced to admit,
“I do not know."

Harvey continued the cross-
examination in an attempt to
prove that Connolly was not a
peace officer as it applied in the
case.

Court was recessed for five
minutes at 3:35. It reconvened at
four o’clock. At this time Con-
nally was recalled to the witness
stand.

Connally finally stepped down
at 4:30.

At this time Harvey again mov-
ed that the case be dismissed
because "the people have not
proved that Whitney breached
the peace at any time."

To further back his point,Har-

vey called Mary Loya to the wit-
ness stand. The D.A. immediate-
ly rose to object because Mrs.
Loya was a spectator inthe court.
This violated the motion passed
by Harvey that all witnesses
should clear the court room.

To 'amend this technicality,
Harvey requested a mass trial.
He was refused. In a final at-
tempt Harvey asked for an
adjournment until Tuesday morn-
ing. He was refused.

Continuing the case, the de
fense called James Whitney to the
witness stand. '

While Gray wasexamining
Whitney, Harvey interrupted the
D.A. This prompted the judge to

- warn Harvey of his improper
court behavior.

Whitney testified that "There
were several requests for the
demonstrators to disperse. lwas
determined to sit until five o’-
clock."

Once again the proceedings
were halted. The judge moved
that the case be adjourned until
10:30 Tuesday morning.

The cases will continue into
next week. '

Student views of Mexico

(Continued from Page 6‘)

The beautiful National Univer-
sity in Mexico City (which 1
attended) is a huge, complex and
unbelievable structure. (94,000
students and 102,000 predicted
by 1970). Being autonomous, the
university encourages student
leadership in all affairs.

If a student group is not Stile
failed with the calibre of a
teacher, the teacher is dismiss~
ed (in 1965 so was the Head
Rector). The high budget allot-
ted to Education in Mexico has
filled the Academic Centers with
very capable and adequate in-
structors.

The most precious part of
Mexico are the poor people. They
are courteous, cooperative, and
friendly, and most of the time
happy, despite the plight they
have suffered for centuries.

To attend a posada at Christ-
mas time, or a fiesta at any
time is an experience. Their
music, dancing and mannerisms
are as near-perfect to happiness
as i can describe. They, alone,
:nake it worthwhile to see Mex.-
