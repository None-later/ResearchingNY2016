On The Oath

Professor Whitney of the Math
Department was removed from the
University payroll recently be-
cause he refused to sign the Oath
of Office which is required by all
State employes. He has now, how-
ever, signed the oath.

Because he was asked to sign
after he had asserted his approval

' of the Teachers Draft Counselors

and had been arrested at the Dow
demonstration, Whitney consider-
ed the oath as an instrument of
political intimidation.

We admit that the timing involv-
ed in this case was poor, however,
only by a clerical error was the
oath not sent to Whitney when he
was first hired. The Supreme Court
has upheld the required oath as
law, and therefore, it is only by
signing the oath that he could leg-

ally teach. This is not political
intimidation.

Whitney’s reasons for now sign-
ing the oath is that his professor-
ship at the University puts him
"in a better position to carry out
activities against the war and
against circumstances which per-
mit this kind 'of war." if this was
his conviction when he was origin-
ally asked to sign, why didn’t he?

Signingxhe oath when he was first
asked would not have compelled
him to believe or act contrary to
his convictions. His signing the
oath, we feel, would not have in-
hibited his criticism of the war in
Vietnam, his activities as a coun-
selor for the Boston Draft Resis-
tance Group, his advocacy of the
Teachers Draft Counselors or his
participation in demonstrations.

Legislative Farce

Several days ago a student posed
a bill from the New York State
Assembly on a bulletin board near
the Colonial Quad Flag Room. in-
troduced by an assemblyman from
the Southern Tier, this and another
bill would demand the forfeiture
of the Regents Scholarship by any
student who participated in any vio-
lent public demonstrations or who
used or possessed illegal drugs.

It is ludicrous to even imagine
that this bill would be sent to the
floor of the Assembly. Our con-
fidence in our Legislators would
be severely shaken if it did make it
to the floor.

The Regents award is given to
students primarily for their schol-
arship. it then follows that, if the
award is to be taken away it should
be because the recipient has not ful-
filled his academic requirements.
To take the scholarship away for
any other reason would be defeat-
ing the purpose of the award.

If a scholarship can be denied
or revoked if the holder partici-
pates in a "violent public demon-
stration” or "uses or possesses
illegal drugs" why can the schol-
arship not be taken away if the
student leads a promiscuous life,

becomes a habitual drunkard, or is

in the numbers racket.

If these two bills somehow do be-
come law then the person designat-
ed by them would receive two pun-
ishments if. he is convictedof us-

  

ing or possessing illegal drugs or
violently demonstrating. The first
punitive measure would be dealt by
the courts; the second by the legis-

lature.
If the drug user or demonstrator

is a high school student he would
not be permitted to apply for a
scholarship. This is punishment

for an action of the past which
should have been dealt with by the

courts. if the person is already
holding a scholarship he would have

it taken from him, but not because
of his academic standing as it
should be.

Is this assemblyman actually at-
tacking the protestors and pot us-
ers or is he attacking the so-called
“intellectual eggheads who coop
themselves up in their universi-
ties?” We feel that the latter is

the basis of these bills.
This attitude which the assem-

blyman and, mostlikely, the people
he represents, hold towards uni-
versity students seems tobebased
on the fear of the people who are
made out to be “smarter than the

ordinary man."
This is not the case; universi-

ties are not to be feared and there-
by controlled and stifled. Those
outside and inside the centers of
education should learn to commun-

icate with each other, not fight.
Perhaps if there were true com-
munication between the legislature
and the universities these unfor-
tunate bills may never have been
introduced.

Report:

The long-awaited report of the
Committee on Undergraduate Edu-
cation has proved for the most
part to live up to the great ex-
pectations held for it. A quite
thorough document, it contains sug-
gestions for some startling innova-
tions and provides a basic over-
view of the direction which the com-
mittee feels the University should
take in the coming decade.

Somewhat conspicuously absent
from the report is any mention of
the possible installation of a pass-
fail system, rumored under con-
sideration by the committee in the
past months. Replacing this are
several options including evalua-
tion by various types of “indepen-
dent study” projects, overall con-
sideration of a student's progress
by persons other than the student’s
instructors, and credit by examina-
tion, among others.

All of these, we feel, provide
constructive alternatives to the
present evaluational process.

In addition, credit by examina-
tion would also serve to free the
student who enters the University
with a great deal of knowledge in
a particular area or who is ca-
pable of attaining proficiency in
elementary material quickly, from
the mind-deadening drudgery of
lower level required courses. This
outside evaluation would also
serve largely to eliminate the
possible personal prejudice caus-
ed by personality clashes and dif-
ferences of opinion between student
and professor.

We hear students daily speak-
ing of professors who will not
tolerate valid opposition to their

own point of view. For this type‘

of professor, we feel, there is no
place in the University, especial-
ly as it is outlined in the curri-
culum report.

Another substantial deviation ad-
vocated in the curriculum report
is the institution of the three quar-
ter system. if this idea were in-
stituted, much of the loss of inter-
est exhibited by the student during
the final weeks of the semester
could be eliminated. By taking
only three coures at a time, the
individual would also be able to
study more fully in these areas.

However, with a little addition
and multiplication, it becomes evi-
dent that, unless these three courag-

 

 

Great pectations

  

es carried four credits each in-
stead of three, either it would be
necessary for the student to spend
more than four years at the Uni-
versity or the total credits neces-
sary for graduation would have to
be reduced.

Of the alternatives foreseeable
at this time, allowing the student
four courses per quarter or three
and an independent study project
seems the optimal plan.

Of the other proposals, the three
year Master’s, the General Col-
lege, the Departmental Program
and the Experimental College, only
the latter is deserving of extensive
criticism.

This proposal, which would ad-
mit students at the beginning of
the. tenth grade and devote their
summers to various study pro-
grams, would, while perhaps good
by educational standards, be detri-
mental to the students involved.
The plan is discriminatory mone-
tarily, even if scholarship aid were
provided, since it would involve
payment of living expenses away
from home for seven years rather
than the four presently involved.

in addition, very few individuals
at age 15 are ready for a college
atmosphere.

if the student is removed from
the home and high school too soon,
as would be the case in the Ex-
perimental College, his develop-
ment would be greatly hampered
by forcing him to face a too ad-
vanced situation with few roots
and familiar faces to turn to.

We feel that, in the interests
of the individual student, setting
aside the possible advantage to the
educational system, this portion of
the report should be disregarded
in the consideration of future di-
rections for the University.

On the other hand, we highly
recommend that the General Col-
lege be considered for implemen-
tation as soon as possible.

A commission set up to review
separately each of the five major
provisions of part five of the re-
port and consider the practical
aspects of implementation, p08-
sibly working during Summer '68,
would be an applaudable step to-
ward the quickest possible in-
stitution of the curriculum report

The memory of this year's
New Hampshire primary will long
linger. out of the morass ofhope.
lessness emerged the first hero
of Election Year 1968. Subse-
quent developments should not
be allowed to dull the luster of
the McCarthy victory. Senator
McCarthy won the first round;
he not only defeated an incum-
bent President but he also, more
importantly conquered the feel-
ings of apathy and alienation that
until March lzth had pervaded us

.11.

We had been prepared to ab-
dicste responsibility; to indulge
ourselves with self-pitying tears
over the inevitabith of e Nixon.
Johnson race. We, who oppose
the war, were finding ourselves
driven out of the political maln-
stresm. We wore, in fact, giv—
ing up on the American demo-
cratic process and not even the
McCarthy effort in New Hamp-
shire could move us.

Then came March lath and it
changed everything. The shocked
visagss of a stunned Huntley
and a delightfully amazed Brink-
ley brought it home to us. Mc-
Carthy had done it. One felt as
if that forty-two per cent vote was
a personal vindication.

One felt somewhat ashamed
that he did not go to New Hamp-
shire; that he did not have the
faith in the American people
that was obviously felt by the
thousands of college students who
did go. However the victory was
our's whether we went to the
Granite State or not.

The victory belonged to each
one of us who sat in front of a
television to see the Secretary
of State say that the President
would not consult with Congress
on further escalations of thewar.
It belonged to each of us who has
argued and fought and demon-
strated only to be met time after
time by frustration and disap-
pointm‘ent.

it belonged to each of us who
was so conditioned to defeat that
we were ready to accept grate-
fully a twenty per cent McCarthy
vote. Today, in the wake of New
Hampshire, we will accept noth-
ing less than victory. Eugene
McCarthy has brought to 1968
what John F. Kennedy brOught
to 1980: excitement and hope.

He also produced the candid-
acy of Robert F. Kennedy. Ken-
nedy is now challenging the Pres-

ident and l welcome his sn-
nouncement with great expecta-
tions. Senator Kennedy has long
been s most articulate antiwar
advocate. He can now work with
Senator McCarthy to insure vic-
tory for a peace candidate. Those
of us who oppose the renomins-
tion of Lyndon Johnson must
not allow ourselves to be divid-
ed st this point. it is perfect-
ly reasonable to support both
Senator Mccsrthy and Senator
Kennedy in fhct there is no
alternative to that approach. One
can be quite certain that these
two idealistic men will weld an
alliance long before the Chicago
convention. It is my personal hope
that McCarthy will release his
delegates in favor of Robert F.
Kennedy and that Senator Ken-
nedy will be nominated. l have
heard all the arguments made
against Kennedy's candidacy and
I find none of them convincing.

There are those who argue
that Senator Kennedy's delay in
announcing his willingness to run
or support McCarthy demonstrat-
ed anew his unseemly ambition
and ruthlessness. These people
contrast McCarthy's courage
with Kennedy’s lack of it.

The fact is that McCarthy had
little to lose by running against
Johnson. He had no Presidential
aspirations and New Hampshire
guaranteed his becoming a na-
tional figure. Kennedy, admitted-
ly a politician, had all to loss.
A " Knnnndv face

There are many who distrust v
Kennedy. They say that hole wily
and deceitful. They have to goal!
the way back to 1967 to find
any evidence to support their
contention but they will not see
these blind intuitions for what
they are.

These are the people who are
driven to such indignation by the
fact tint so many of us are so
emotionally involved with Bobby
Kennedy. They don't quite real-
ise that statements like, "There
is just something about Bobby!
don’t like so i can't vote for
him," are a good deal less ra-
tional and a good deal more dan-
Qrous than anything we say.
They just don't trust Robert Ken-
nedy; it is very unfortunate and
perhaps tragic that otherwise
reasonable people persist in see-
ing self-doubt as deviousness and
intensity as ruthlessness.

It is about time that they face
the fact that you cannot divorce
politics from the Presidency and
that, as the Eisenhower exper-
ience should teach us, it can
be very dangerous to attempt to.

I look forward to supporting
Robert Kennedy for the nomina-
tion and in November. One can
only hope that the disenchant-
ed Democrats realize that he
must be the candidate that they
finally agree upon. The times
require greatness and Robert
F. Kennedy is the one man
today who offers it.

racial lem, in the u.s. and
the Pue lo incident. The column
is also graced, this week, with
the viewpoint of another student,
Michael Muller, on the Pueblo
incident.

Mekola has a novel criticism
of the U.S. role in the Pueblo
affair. He believes that es-
pionage in any form is an im-
moral enterprise. Adekols ques-
tions the judgment behind reten-
sion of spy shine, by any navy.
Adekoll. bemoans the fact that
the Pueblo indicent occurred
through a needless vigilance.

The funds allocated to espion-
age not only detract from sources
of economic and educational de-
velopment, they are unnecessar-
ily allocated to begin with. Ade-
koia thinks that defense spending
should be geared to counter-ss-
pionate activities within the U.S.,
in order to be truly defensive.

Since Russian 'fishing’ traw-
lers have merely been fined upon
violation of U.S. waters, Adekola
feels that North Korea should in-
stitute a similarly mild re-
prisal against the U.S.S. Pueblo.
Adekola suggests that the Soviet
Union, and the U.N. should inter-
vene on behalf of the U.S. ship
and crew. ,

Michael Muller. a junior
majoring in political science.
also proffers his view on the

Pueblo indicent. He cites the
R847 and 0-2 cases, in

the 11.8. first denied, and later
admitted, that 0.8.8.11. air space
had been violated. With such evi.‘
dance of 'credibility gap' in 0.9.
official statements, Michsslsees
much reason for doubt lnpresent
official statements.

Adekols's opinions on the TI!
ciel problem seem to be as mild
as his other views, if not more
so. He believes that American
Negroes should have equal op-
portunity for education and em-
ployment, and equal payment for
that employment.

These attitudes may seem
oversimplified and naive, yet,
how naive and bigoted Americans
must seem to the rest of the
world when such a problem can-
tinues to defy resolution.

The 0.8. has, sod, already
altered its stand on the matter
by admitting the 'possibility' of
violation of N. Korean waters
by the U.S.S. Pueblo. The justi-
fication for American outrage at
the incident is largely under-
minded.

The pro-war generation nas
failed; the post-war generation
(WWII or Vietxulm, take your
choice) displays an apathy more
dangerous than the aforemen-
tioned failure; an:i Americaruils‘

in 1968 will destroy any claim
he might have had on the 1972
nomination. And yet Kennedy is
running and he is running, not
merely to protest but to win.

Robert Kennedy's candidacy
lends a new credibility to the
anti-war movement. He is the
mtional figure that Eugene Mc.
Car-thy is not. Kennedy, for most
Americans, symbolizes the anti-
Johnson faction of the party. He
will gain much more than the
anti-war vote.

Hundreds of politicans in this
country today feel an allegiance
to Robert Kennedy that stems
from 1960. He is not about to
lead a quixotic crusade; he can
garner the professional sup.
port that can lead him to the
White House. The stakes in 1968
are much too high for us to go
with anyone but the one man who
can be elected as the peace can-
didate.

 

 

"Oh, my root's got a hole in it"

It’s All Greek To Me...

by Maggie Diet:

 

 

This is a word of encourage-
ment to you in the metamorphic
state called PLEDGE!

it may seem as if you're sup-
posed to be everything and noth-
ing at the same time. You're
wearing a jacket, but you’re not
a brother yet; you’re part of a
sisterhood, but not yet a sister.

Is the Sword ofDamacles hang-
ing over your had? Noi If you
face up to the situation, you'll
find that it's (what you probably
think is) an overly - sagacious
brother or sister who has pin-
pointed snd pronounced your par-
ticular Achilles' Heel to spur
you on a little.

As a part of the metamorpha-
sis from "worm" to "whatever,"
a pledge goes through what is
traditionally called Hell Week.
The duties you're expected to
perform may seem "UNBELIEV-
ABLE," but your brothers or
sisters do have some definite
purposes in mind.

You may be asked to get Sig-
natures on various kinds of med-
ia, take a poll, iron shirts, or
even "Go to all your classes this
weekl" These duties, believe it
or not, are designed for fun!
Their purpose is, also, to help
you meet people in an informal
situation. With the encourage-
ment of your brothers or sis-
ters you will meet not only
members of other groups, but
also faculty members of the
University Community.

The individual fun activities

 

of pledging are best compliment-
ed by a group project which may
be required of your pledge class.
Under the leadership of your
brothers or sisters, you may
be requested to complete a pro-
ject or service for your group,
your University, or your Com-
munity.

Your fraternity or sorority
may need a new decoration or
piece of furniture for the lounge.
You may be asked to help in a
Clean-Up or Renovation Project
for the University or the Com-
munity. You may spend some
time doing volunteer work at a
hospital, or on a Drive for the
Red Cross, Heart Fund, or Can-
car.

The point is, of course, that
your status as a pledge becomes
what you do with it. Pledging
varies from group to group and
the examples l've mentioned are
a beginning sampling.

Your brothers or sisters will
frequently remind you of the
colors you’re wearing, but
they're doing it for a purpose.
it's important to assess and re-
member the fact that fraternal
groups are formed and perpet-
uated by reciprocelCHOlCE, both
group and individual.

The metamorphic state of
PLEDGE can chrystallize into
a pretty great metamorphic state
of GREEK; in both cases,thero's
a lot of group and individual
growing going. on. ,

 

Review Of The New Righl Wing

by Roy Bertrand

 

 

I agree, with members of both
ends of the political spectrum,
that a society without construc-
tive criticism is indeed totali-
tarian. And those people whose
beliefs push them to the right
do, strangely enough, also have
criticisms.

First, I shall examine the prob-
lems of the Negroes. l hesitate
to label this case the Negro prob-
lem, because I don't consider Ne-
groes as a problem. I feel that
Rap Brown and Stokley Carmich-
ael are problems, however . . .
not as Negroes, but as hate-fill-
ed, commie-loving, hammer-and-
sickle subversives. The life of
the Negroes, from any point of
view (except perhaps, those of
Governor and Mr. Wallace, Les-
ter Maddox, and KKK members),
is filled with troubles. lam op-
posed to handouts by the govern-
ment. Giving is not the answer.
Helping is-

I definitely would not be op-
posed to a non-wasteful job train-
ing program. The present
scheme, where it costs more in
a year to train a man than he
could possibly earn, is unrealis-
tic. I can commend the idea and
the volunteers, but not the prac-
tice. Having been trained proper-
ly, an individual can learn to
compete in a world full of re-
wards, and reap the benefits.
He can live in dignity, rather
than in one of humiliation caus-
ed by handouts unfair in part to
the taxpayer, but totally destruc-
tive to the ego of the recipient.
What the Negro really wants
is self-respect, and only through
capitalism can he achieve that
end.

Next, I shall examine a few
aspects of the Vietnam War.
Concerning inhumanity: if the salt
of the earth wants to protest,
how about both sides? Hearing
that the VC are all good Joes
makes me sick, as does the un.
provoked accusation that we are
imperialist aggressors. in our
recent history, we have demon-
strated, more than once, that we
are in favor of giving people
freedom, rather than enslav-
ing them.

Anyone interested can check
the commie records on thatpoint;
I needn’t expound their doctrine
of imposing shackles on every
country they lay their crummy
hands on. is Vietnam fighting in
our best national interest? 1 con-

”tend that every square inch in

the world that Marxists don't have
is worth defending. They've
shown in the past that if you give
them an inch, they’ll take the
country. If we allow this prac-
tice to continue, pretty soongood
old US. of A. will be the only
free republic in the world.

Pulling out isn't the answer to
a sensible solution in Southeast
Asia. That would easily result
in the wholesale slaughter of
millions. You’d think that peo-
ple would learn by the lesson
of Munich in 1938, that aggres-
sors are never satisfied.

Now a constructive criticism
of the left. We on the right real-
ize that the United States is far
from perfect; but today, we are
as close as anyone has ever
come. Our ultimate goal is the
perfection of our society. if l’m
not incorrect, the goal of the
"New Left” is the destruction
of our society. We both say that
we’re not perfect. The right re-
plies, "Let's try harder." The
left's solution is, “Let’s start
all over.” Destruction of great-
ness rarely reproduces great-
nose.

I suggest the left also take
part in the quest for perfection.
We must build instead of destroy.
The men who signed the Declara-
tion of Independence laid thebest
possible foundation. The only task
remaining is the finishing
touches. Of course, perfection
can never be reached, but striv-
ing for it can build a better life
for all of us than socialism could
ever hope to offer.

Apologies are in order for two
mistakes in last weeks column.
First of all, i was referring to
the proposed protest against the
Firestone Company, and not Arm-
strong as was stated. Secondly,
shortly after i wrote praising
Dr. James Whitney for having
the fortitude to quit his job for
what he believed in, he announc-
ed hc would sign a loyalty oath
and go on teaching. The signing
of the oath, i feel, is in direct
conflict with Dr. Whitney’s con-
victlons.

P.S. Fred Halstead, Socialist
Workers Party candidate for US.
Resident, looks like a fat capital-
s .
