Balance of Views

To the Editor:

I must compliment you on the
balance of the political views ex-
pressed inyour editorial columns
of the March 1 issue. Anyone
who says that we did not have
more than one view of political
philosophy in our comprehensive
student newspaper is, oi course,
an anarchist (who also happens to
have the added attribute of ob-
jectivity.)

Ray Bertrand's column con-
cerning the Dow Chemical de-
monstration was excellent;
especially the section about the
behavior of the demonstrators. I
noted that the demonstrators
could have taken a hint from Mr.
Bertrand’s "Normal People"
who heckled him; spewing good,
down to earth patriotic, Anglo-
Saxon, four-letter-words; whose
meaning everyone understood. I
felt the yelling in cadence oi one
of these terms was extremely
exemplaritive oi the intelligence
of the YAF.

Also, I enjoyed Mr. Bertrand’s
definition oi a true patriot. It is
reminiscent oi Germany'sdefini-
tion during the ’30s and '40s; a
period of time which we all look
back to as an ideal.

His definition of a patriot is
one who "loves the U.S., as It is,
a capitalist sovereign nation."
Most collegians would not draw
this conclusion on their own —-
but Mr. Bertrand had set them
straight!

Bert Devorsetz' column is also
deserving of recognition. He con-
cerns himself with the personal
hygiene oi the demonstrators. I
am sure that the American
soldiers in Vietnam can sym-
pathize with him, as they are
forced to savor the odor of the
scorched, decaying flesh of their
friends and enemies.

I noticed that it was difficult
to distinguish between the scent
of the demonstrators and that of
the "normal" hecklers.

i did not feel Mr. Devorsetz’
concern for Albany State’s pos-
sible "degeneration" onto a
Berkeley or Antioch is well
grounded. The academic
standards of these schools, obvi-
ously, do not compare with Albany
State’s "magnificent" standing.

The renown people who have
graduated from Antioch and
Berkeley are obviously left-wing
upstarts. Just because they have
the highest posts in government
and industry is, of course no rea-
son to suspect that these schools
have anything going for them.

Don Gennett’s column is
another deserving comment. The
extreme seriousness with which
he approached the Dow Problem
(that of a man dying from eating
sandwich wrapped in Saran wrap)
is alarming.

This represents his total
awareness of the great moral
dilemma facing mankind today,
With his type of approch, we will
never have to face this dilemma;
so it will just naturally go away.

Therefore, I wish toagain com-
pliment the newspaper on its
magnificent array of political
thought in its March lst issue.
The left of center arguments
were magnificent although the
newspaper wisely made the stu-
dents look for them. lfound some

Founding Peace

To the Editor:

We must be on guard against
attempting to found peace upon
a false foundation. We must base
all of our actions upon caro-
ful thought and open discussion.
Any counsel that denies this do-
nies the universal brotherhood
of all men by reducing some men
to the status of more tools to
be exploited by other men. There-
fore, it denies the very founda-
tion of peace.

Is it not an amazing inconsis-
tancy that some of those who
would advise us to question the
entire structure of our society
would have us limit the thought
and the discussion that precseds

our actions?

Perhaps they would be only
too glad todoour thinkingfor
us. Furthermore, we must at
least question the counsel of
those who would have us destroy
part of our society but who are
unable or unwilling to tell us
what they would erect in its

place. '

We should take no comfort
from such vague statements as
something will evolve out of the
process of change. That some-
thing might weu be a military
government or government by a
power block. Moreover, we can
base no hope for peace upon a
counsel which would sanction vio-
lence within our own nation.

How will we be expected to
behave oonviolently toward our
brothers in other lands if we
can offer no counsel except the
counsel of force within our land?

We must remember that the
oppressors as well as the op
pressed are victims of their cir-
cumstances. Violence can not
change this situation, for vio-
lence by its very nature forces
some men to become the oppres-
sors of their brothers and creates
a self-perpetuating cycle of vio-
lence.

We must remember that our
greatest problem today probably
consists of men with good in-
tentions who are so damn sure
that they are right that they would
destroy the World in order to
save it.

Healthy Changes

To the Editor:

Mr. Devorsetz's column, "On
the Starboard Side,” and Mr.
Iseman’s "The Right Way"(ASP,
March 8, 1968) were good
catalysts for liberal discussion.
However, some of us liberals who
are earning academic freedom
and who know demonstrations —
my experience as a black in
Mississippi was proof enough—
can produce healthy changes in
society like good journalism in
our campus paper. I hope Messrs.
Devorsetz and lsemanwill accept
the following quotation from Ric-
hard M. Weaver's "The Ethics of
Rhetoric" as a carminative:

‘ ' The machinery of propagation
and inculcation is today so im-
mense that no one avoids entirely
the assimilation and use of some
terms which have a downward ten-
dency. It is especially easy to
pick up a tone without realizing
its trend. Perhaps the best that
any of us can do is to hold a
dialetic with himself to see what
the wide circumferences of his
terms of persuasion are. The
process will not only improve
the consistency of one's thinking
but it will also . . . prevent his
becoming a creature of evil public
forces and a victim of his own
thoughtless rhetoric."

Eyes Mock

Eyes mock the man who owns
them when those eyes are blind or
astigmatized. It seems that the
column written by I. Mock (He
doesn’t sound like Bertrand Rus-
sell or Russell Bertrand — He
has no eyes man!) must eitherbe
self-mockery or scorn for the
reader.

The title of the article, of that
copiously unsighted hindview,
"Invisible Man on Campus,"
brings to mind the Ralph Ellison
book entitled “Invisible Man."
Ellison deals with the hardship
thrust upon the Negro by Cauca-
sian blindness to the problems
and individuality of both black
and white alike. 1. Mock is guilty
of the same crime.

The fir t American patriot to
be kill , in the Revolutionary
War, Crispus Atticus, the former
slave referred to by Mock, might
as well have died a slave for the
treatment given him in the
column. I. Mock dared tousehim
(in the same manipulative sense
that Ellison decried) to help just!-
fy cur current'liberation’efforts
in Vietnam, while ignoring the
contract between the patriotism
of Negro soldiers in Vietnamand

the blindness that whites display
toward blacks in the states. This
is not justice just because it’s

blind.
The next time that l. Mock
chooses to use a Negro patriot
to prove a point, lhope hedoesn't
ignore the implications of Negro
patriots demise in the cause or
Vietnamese ‘freedom.’ Such a
staunch freedom fighter as I.
Mock, certainly shouldn't wish to
reveal his hypocrisy by relent-
less babbling on'freedom fights,’
while ignoring every aspect of
the milieu of the real patriot, the
freedom fighter, black or white.
I think that l. Mock should take
to heart (and head), the last
statement of his polemics, "We
must press forward intelligently
. . ." Why don't you do that, l.
Mock. It's a worthy and sincere
challenge for any patriot, lame or

blind.

Correction

To the Editor:

Regarding your printing of my
article, "The Port side" in last
week's ASP (March 15), l wishto
point out only the most important
of the many errors.

Please change "We do not sup-
port. ." to "We support the right,
(sic) of black people to achieve
freedom by any means they con-
sider necessary to attain it.”

and, l might add, the SWP-
YSA supports that right uncondi-
tionaily.

Sincerely yours,

Off-Center Off

To the Editor:

M. J. Rosenberg's recent lOff
Center' was really just that and
one had to strain to glean a
grain of truth. This conglomer-
ation of falsifications reflects
the sick mentality of the Zion-
ists. “The Rosenberg" vomit-
ed the usual zionism content of
hatred, antisemitism, genocide,
insolence, etc., while waving his
rusty sword (antisemitism) to
scare people, but his blade is
dull.

“The Rosenberg" accused
Roosevelt of making a coalition
with Hitler, and the State Depart-
ment of Antisemitism because it
denounced the barbarism of the
Israelis. Yet he forgot that the
US. with the aid of colonial
Britain created Israel on Arab
soil, cruciﬁed the Palestinian
Arab nation, armed, financed and
actively supported the Israelis
to please Zionism, the twin of
Naniism. The Israelis destroyed
a U.B. ship "Liberty" killing 34
Americans, yet they were for-
given whereas tho United States
is destroying North Vietnam be.

and no Americans were killed.
Why “the Rosenberg" forgets
all that. Perhaps he has a case
of selective amnesia.

It is interesting to note that
"the Rosenberg” uses the Ausch-
witz and Dachau persecutions as
an excuse for the zionists to es-
tablish their third Reich "Is-
rael," and to practice annihila-
tion in the Middle East under
the protection of the 0.8. The
zionist robbed Palestine and
yet label any Palestinian objec-
tion antisemitism. U.S. profes-
sors who visited the area and
tell the truth are accused of anti-
semitism. "The Rosenberg" and
his band of censors prescribe
to the American people what
they should or should not know.
He establishes the principle that
the Zionists are the untouchables.
Hitler should be condemned for
his crimes but the zionists should
not be condemned for their
crimes.

Finally, Arab students need
not to listen to a Zionist robot.
Moreover, they are confident that
the Americans are intelligent
people capable of differen-
tiating between facts and falla-
cies, between Rosenberg's
myths, propaganda, illusions and
hallucinations on one hand and
truth on the other. .

To the Editor:

In reply to Mr. Rosenberg's
fanatic arguments i must admit
that he has a wild imagination
to conjure tint the State Dept.

is antisemltic and pro-Arabwhen
most Arab countries do not even
have diplomatic relations with
the U.S. However, what struck
me as most fanatic was the usual
Zionist argument which one hears
repeated over and over againand
which successfully intimidates
even the most liberal mlndsfrom
questioning the true nature ofthe
Arab-Israeli conflict. The means
of this powerful argument is one
label: "Anti-Semit." This label
crushes the Arab side of the
story before you have even ex-
posed yourself to the facts.
And as Mr. Rosenberg has used
it, this label rests on a sound
psychological method which the
Zionists exploit and that is, the
guilt feeling of all Christians
who have persecuted the Jews
throughout their history and most
recently for the genocide of the
six million Jews.

To us Arabs, the Palestinian
problem is an instance ofdispos-
session, not of an individual dis-
possessing another, but rather
of individuals dispossessing an
entire people from their legal
home.

We realize that the Jews are
representative of the 12 tribes
of Israel which conquered most
of Palestine in the 13th Century
B.C., that they were evicted by
Nebuchadnezzar in 587 8.6. and
later by the Romans in 135 A.D.

We realize that these Jews
who were living in Europe were
persecuted constantly by the West
and that Hitler’s atrocities left
many of them homeless. But we
also know that we have consti-

Friday, March 22, l968

Historically, empire building
has been a risky business because
the architects usually injure the
people whom they use as building
blocks. In 1938, the Japanese
cabinet wanted to settle the war
in China. It was stymied in that
attempt by the Japanese general
staff which argued that the ﬂower
of J apan’s youth was being killed
off by the politicans' error in
stimulating intervention in China.
The general staff made clear,
that it was not about toaccept the
idea that the young men who died
in China did so in vain. Thus
more lives were thrown away.
There was also another reason
for the rashness of the Japanese
military: they wanted to protect
their prestige and dominance in
politics, and the national budget.
Thus the military forced the
civilian cabinet to escalate and
to continue actions which led to
the Second World War.

The United States is dealing
with similar experiences today,
and the same confrontation is
developing because of the Viet-
nam War. Marcus Raskin, form-
er White House assistant under
President Kennedy, remarked on
this civilian-military issue in
1967:

“The methods we have followed
in Vietnam may not be without
cost, in terms ofour own nation's
stability and freedom of choice.
When we ask the military to
undertake projects which are
inherently unmilitary, we are
courting great danger. The of-
ficial American policy in Vietnam
is to support a civilian govern-
ment, but the rank-and-file in-
tary, as well as high ranking
American military officers, sup-
port the South Vietnamese mili-
tary. Bad habits are learned in
such wars, and they may be too
easily applied at home." These
“bad habits" are steadily rein-
forced as the Pentagon wrestles
more power from the civilian
sector of government. An ex-
ample is the recent House Arm-
ed Service Committee bili estab-

lishing a four-year term for the
chief of staff of the Army, the
Navy, and the Air Force. Until
this bills inception, the President
had been able to exercise control
over the Joint Chiefs of Staff by
not appointing them to set terms,
thus making it clear to them that
they were not independent. The
President and the Secretary of
Defense were in astrong position
to sack any general or admiral
who met with their disapproval.
The new bill negates this civilian
power, giving the military afreer
rein.

In addition to relinquishing the
power ofdismissal, the President
has also subordinated much of his
authority to his military advis-
ors. It is a general rule that

 

ALBANY STU DENT/PRESS-

leaders depend on iheirtopbrass
during wartime. Thus, when a
President commits himself to a
policy of escalation, he must
lend an ear to their demands,
and recommendations which they
make cannot be avoided. He is
the passenger in the plane and
must depend on his crew for
ﬂight.

The military power is eroding
civilian authority in America.
Like any large bureaucracy, the
Pentagon perpetuates itself by
absorbing power and spreading
influence. Since the military mind
is basically authoritarian, it does
not see government lndemocratic
terms. Its forte is domination and
regimentation, and these are the
historic enemies ofourliberties.

The President's Advisory
Commission on Civil Disorders
used a very disturbing phrase
in their recent March 2 report.
They said that welfare recip-
ients should be "able to regard
assistance as a right." When
people begin to think of welfare
as a right, and not a privilege,
our entire economic and social
structure is threatened.

Let's examine the legal and
social validity and practicality
of making welfare a right. First,
there is no law that gives peo-
ple the “right” (in the sense of
the right to life, liberty andprop-
erty) to a welfare check. Our
Constitution grants and protects
our political rights; it is a po-
litical, not a social document.
The Founding Fathers intended

to rive everyone equal ‘r- '
tunity, not equal reward. ,0,”
Our present welfare system
can probably be traced back to
our Judeo-Christian heritage.We
feel that we have-the moral ob-
ligation.to take care of others.
Society’s responsibility is moral
not legal: the welfare recipients'
aide is their privilege, not their
right. ‘
Unfortunately, sccial rights
have been interpreted into the
Constitution. These decisions, of-
ten increasing the scope and in-
tensity ofwelfare programs, have
all but destroyed what Max Web-
er called the Protestant Work
Ethic in America. The trend
towards the welfare state leis
diminished the incentive to work
and caused serious social and

Albany State has recently been
selected as one of the contributr
ing agencies to aworld-wide time
capsule to explain to future gen-
erations something of our time.

We had the pleasure of din-
ing last week with one of the
foreign investigators who has
been on our campus checking us

ut.

“What here has interested you
most?" we asked.

“No question about it," he
said, “your non-profit bookstore.
I am convinced that it is being
run as a psychological exper-
iment to see how much can be
put over American college stu-
dents, supposedly the smartest
group in the world.”

"We don't understand," we
said.

“Simple. Where else in the
world would someone have the
nerve to charge college-edu-
cated people 29 cents for an
81/2 x l2 inch Ail-sheet pad of
yellow legal paper, but offer a
package of 2 pads for only 59

cents?”

"Is that all?" we said.

“Not quite. How can students
frequent a place which pays no
rent and slave wages,but charges
the same prices as the Mistletoe
Bookstore, which pays higher
wages and Is in ahigh rent dis-
trict. Yet they believe FSA when
they say the store lost a large
amount of money last year. Even
if they do believe it, why do they
allow it to continue?"

"We don't know,” we sighed.
"What else?"

“Well, there has been no hand
towels in the basement men's
room of the Campus Center nor
any soap in the basement
women’s room all semester, sav-
ing the college much money. Has
a single person complained to
authorities or do they just suf-
fer and bitch?"

“That’s not fair! That's just
a minor thing. What other ob-
servations do you have?”

in Palestine for 1300 years and
have built there our homes, our
families and our hope. We con-
sider it our ancestral home. We
believe that this length of time has
given us the right to keep our
homes, and not be robbed of our
property as if by a whimsical
absentee landlord possessing
unquestionable power and

To us Palestinians, this Is-

as opposed to the West’s fanatic

pay for crimes which Germany
and the West have committed

West compensate the Jews as

Election Congrads

To the Editor:

First, as a member of Central
Council, I would like to public-
ally congratulate the Election
Commission for a very excel-
lently-managed election. Con-
siderlng the great difficulties of
past elections, It is obvious that
the management of elections has
come a long way toward the better
in just in few months.

Secondly, I am hopeful that the
problems which did arise in these
recent elections may be easily
eliminated or alleviated. Above
all, one big problem must be
solved — how to get people to
vote. The fact that just barely
20 per cent of the student body
voted points its finger accusingly
in a number of directions. Is the
election Commission to be
blamed? To some degree, yes.ls

the Student Body at fault? YES!
It, or rather we, find ourselves
not caring who guidesthe govern-
mental bodies; that is, until we
find something wrong or want
something done. Then, those
same people who couldn‘t be
bothered with voting are the
people who yell the loudest or
kick the hardest.

Many of these people do not
realize that in just a few years—
or maybe even this year —- they
must vote for the leaders of a
nation. Will they care enough to
vote then? I wonder.

Lastly, I feel it must be noted
that the change in voting pro
cedures here at SUNYA waslniti-
oted, not by the Election Commis-
sion, but rather by an Election
Bill presented to Central Council
early in the fall semester. The
bill forced the question and pre-
cipitated changes that otherwise
might have taken a number of
semesters to gradually evolve.

Its writer was ticked off at
the occurrences of the past elec-
tions and decided to do something
about it. I know.

I wrote it!

Jerusalem

To the Editor:

! was doing some research in
back issues of "The Jerusalem
Post" the other day. In view of
the recent articles in the ASP
dealing with the Arab-Israeli
issue I would like to share a few
comments made by an EastJeru-
salemite, Dr. Shawki J. Kubleh,
M. 50., M. Ch., of the Jeru-
salem Clinic, Belt Hanina, in an
article in the December 20, 1087
"Jerusalem Post," He wrote:

"I too am a refugee. . .But
whose fault was it ? l, as Arab

nationalist, point the finger of
guilt at us. Nobody forced us to
abandon our houses, our orange
groves, our lands, our country.
Why sould we, now that guilt is
weighting heavily on our
shoulders, blame the State of
Israel for driving us out in 1948?
You say, all our former property
was confiscated and giventototal
strangers. But who was the
one who left it all behind? If you
have property, take care of it;
if you leave, you have no right
0 it.
“Having kept a dairy since
1940, l carefully traced my notes
and found out that those people
who nowadays are living in tents
and camps, have always hadtheir
dwellings and shall always have
their homes in slovenly tents and
shabby hovels. . .In short, an
idle refugee has always been
lazy! I l

"Why should Israel return to
us our previous abodes? May I
ask, on what grounds do you
propose it? Even, had the Arab
armies reconquered "Pales-
tine," what privileges have we
as "Palestinians" to claim our
former property? Whofought this
war but Arabs who heard of
Palestine and never set eyes on
it?”. . .

“One more thing: it is very
unfortunate that we know nothing
of Israel and the Israelis. The
tragedy is that they know more
about us than we know ourselvesl!
Our people and Arab brethren
call your exerted efforts in vain.
Why? Because we neverbothered
to know about Israel. We were
too sure of our victory. In our
rabid and blind hate, we have
learned absolutely nothing. . .

I hope that my fellow students
and faculty members will give
some further thought to"the guilt
and the refugees."

the budget of Music Council was

amount of money they asked

"But they hold down expenses

“That’s true. The budget for
next year is only $45,000 over
what was expected, necessitating
a more than $5 per person in-
crease in student tax."

“Wow! I can’t afford that. But
aren't they acting in our best
interests?"

"Sure. Under the current sys-
tem, only half the members are
elected directly by the students,
and they on the basis of person-
alities since there areno parties,
no platforms and no possible way
of knowing what a student stands
for when he runs for Council."

"What can we do about it?"

"Nothing. By my actual count,
99.2 per cent of the student body
doesn't care in the slightestwhat
Central Council does, andalmost
60 per cent don’t even know there
is a Central Council."

“Is all of this going into your
official report?"

“Of course. We feel this is
the best way to show your de-
cendents why the American so-
ciety is filled with arrogance,
intolerance, racism and war.
With products of one of Ameri-
ca's educational systems com-
ing out like this, it is plain
that there was no one to stop
the country from going to Pot.”

‘ repercussions.

The most repugnant example
of the abuse of the welfare sys-
tem is shown by the recipients
who simply refuse to work, or
those who refuse to accept em-
ployment because they think that
the job is below them. The atti-
tude of these good-for-nothing
loafers is exemplified by Mrs.
Beulah Sanders, Chairman of the
City-Wide Coordinating Commit-
tee of Welfare Groups (NYC).
She says that she would not ac-
cept employment for less than
$6,500 a year, "and no dead-end
job neither, a job with a future."
Well, Beulah, society doesn’t owe
you anything!!! and people with
your attitude shouldn't receive
a cent of assistance. other we!-
fare clients, particularly in NYC
are not satisfied withapartments
that rent for $90 a month. Rath-
er, they demand and often re-
ceive housing in the $150-$250
per month range.

The ultimate goal of the bleed.
ing-heart liberals and profession-
al parasites is the guaranteed
annual income. Several egg-head-
ed economists have suggested
giving a guaranteed wage of not
less than $3,500 a year per fam-
ily of 4. Although this may sound
unbelievable to many, it is re-
ceiving serious consideration.
In fact, it is one of the Presi-
dent's riot commission’s pro-
posals.

If this practice were initiated,
how many hard working people
making $45,000 a year would
keep their jobs? Would itbe worth
their while to work a year and
earn only $1,000 morethan some-
one not working? Furthermore,
the cost of such a program would
be 15-25 billion dollars. Where
would the money come from?
Supposedly, the federal govern-
ment would continue to play Rob-
in Hood, but i for one do not rel-
ish the idea of paying higher

Apologies must be extended to
Chi Sig for my reference to their
assimilation of the 26 mule team.
So what If they took in 26 mules,
look at what the other sororities
took in.

One of the members of The
Club was abductedfrom his apart-
ment in the middle of the night.
Although kldnapings are not at all
unusual during pledging, this one
was. He was kidnaped by four
girls from Hudson Valley.

The past few weekends have
seen the Rathskellar filled to
capacity during the evenings.
Most State students are still
frequenting tho off-campus spots
while the snack bar has become
a “Pig pick-up Palace" for the
"men" of I‘tPl and Union. It
would seem that we already have
enough iaggots of our own with-
out having to turn to imports.

The New Myskania has taken
the oath as the guardian of Al-
bany's traditions. Of course, our
only remaining tradition is My
Myskania itself.

The local hippies are headed
for the all-eastern demonstration

 

award this year. Forthcoming de-
monstrations and the reasons for
each include:

Alpo Dog Food — feed for
Army watchdogs.

Kellogg's Corn Flakes — they
help little boys “tall-up" intobig
soldiers.

Gold Medal Flour — cookies
sent to the boys in Vietnam are
made with Gold Medal.

Bob Hope — entertains the
troops.

Opticians —— they make
glasses, glasses improvethe aim
of our soldiers in Vietnam.

The Pacific Ocean— for giving
the Navy the means for trans-
porting troops.

Sigma Tau Bets has increased
its membership to 04 brothers.
Since it is the largest fraternity
on Campus and has the most
brothers involved in school af-
fairs, I must say that STB is
probably the best fraternity on
this Campus . . . Bullshit!

The number ofenlistments into
the Army seems to be growing
pr0portionally to the increased
size of South Vietnam's lied Light
districts. What some guys won't
go through for a good lay.
