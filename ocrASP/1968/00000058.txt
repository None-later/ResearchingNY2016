Lewis

Reviews

Theatre Season

Actor, director, and teacher
Robert Lewis spoke before a
large, interested, and entertain-
ed audience in Page Hall onMon-
day night. Mr. Lewis is present-
ly the holder of the Agnes E.
Futterer Lectureship and cur-
rently teaches two courses in
dramatic art at the University.

Lewis' speech was entitled "A
Non-Critic Reviews the New York
Theatre Season" and was co-
sponsored by the Theatre Alumni
Association and the Department
of Speech and Dramatic Art of
the University,

Lewis' opening comments in
the past Broadway season were
entirely general. "The season
was divided into badmusicals,
comedies, imports, and old plays.

Speaking on the first play ofthe
season, Mary Mercier's"Johnny
No-Trump" (a play "of real
merit” with “no chance of sur-
vival”), Lewis blamed the Broad—
way audience for the production's
swift demise(" it opened and clos-
ed on the same night")

Lewis' main complaint in this
case was that in order to satisfy
the modern New York theatre
audience, plays "must be pre-
packaged” with "names." This
he continued, is " a horrible
economic fact" about Broadway
today.

Lewis was particularly critical
when speaking ofEdward Albee.
(“Here goes another friend")
Commenting on that playwright's
recent unsuccessful adaptation of
a British drama, " Everything in
the Garden," Lewis asked, “ Why
does he do it?”

On this point, Lewis was refer-
ing to Albee's puzzlinglnsistence
on adapting other works "that
resist the adaptor's hand" in-
stead of concentrating on his own
original ideas.

Oi Arthur Miller's new play,
“The Price," Lewis felt that it
is "good, solid, with sound char-
acters" but that it is too old-
iashioned and out of the times.
too much like Miller's older
plays with no commentary on
modern day problems.

Lewis pointed out that this
play is merely a full-length ex-
pansion of a one-act teleplay that
Miller had read to Lewis in synop-
sis form more thanadecade-and-
a-half ago.

Turning to off-Broadway,
Lewis admitted that "Macbird"
was "very funny" but "was too

easy, like some sort of prank,
with no real meat of genuine
satire.”

He added that a delegation of
foreign theatre luminaries who
saw the play during the summer
were "very greatly offended by
the piay's lack of taste" and its
“unintellectual satire."

Lewis called "The Board" "a
landmark, a first" the audience
was "bombarded by psychedelic
lights and screeching noise for
a solid half-hair after the play
had begun.”

Later, at the conclusion of the
play, an indescribable sexual act
was performed on stage com-
pletely and in fun view oi the
audience (for the first time in
dramatic history).

Lewis warned that the Lincoln
Center and APA-Phoenix Reper-
tory Theatres are trying "to
create a library of good plays"
without first ensuring that they
will always be assuredofcapable
casts for their productions.

Lewis lavished much praise on
the recent performances oi the
Merce Cunningham and Robert
Jeffrey Ballet Troupes for their
successful employment oi mixed
media concepts in their shows.

Commenting on why artists are
not usually successful when hand-
ling mixed media techniques,
Lewis pointed out that mixed
media is a very stagy process
and that these artists "are not
theatrical enough" either in
training or imagination to use
mixed media to its best advanb
ages during a performance.

"Affairs’  Presented'kl '
Highly Polished Production

by Francine Hole

The state University Theatre
is currently presenting its third

major production of the year,
"The Affairs of Anatol" by Ar-
thur Schnitzler. The play, which
was directed by Dr. Paul Bruce
Pettit and presented in the Rich-
ardson Studio Theatre on March
13-16 and 20-23 must on the
whole be judged a very polished
production.

The story itself is essentially
static. In the course of seven
scenes the audience is given
a glimpse into the character of
one, Anatol, and his relations
with a seemingly endless succes-
sion of Victorian ladies. The
play, though pleasant, is com-
pletely episodic and devoid of
plot.

In each scene Anatol is either
filling in or out of love while
rigorously practicing the double
standard of chastizing these lad-
ies for their previous relatiom
ships. This, in toto, is all we
ever learn about our hero —-
he remains neither completely
dispicable nor completely ad-
mirable.

Given the play, however, one
must acknowledge this as show-
tifully executed production. The
acting was consistently good, the
staging interesting, and the tech-
nical aspects superb.

Each scene began with a tab-
leau viewed through a house cur-
tain made of scrim, which work-
ed beautifully to set the scene
with an almost picture card ef-
fact.

The character Anatol was most
excellently enacted by Mr. Wil-
liam Snyder, and Fred Penzel
as his philosophical friend, Max,
also did a fine job with perhaps
the most witty and delightful lines
of the play.

Soph-Jr Weekend

All other performances were
consistently good. Anne Murray
gave an excellent performance
as Emily, in one of the most
serious scenes of the play, while
Gila Slavin as Mimi and Heidi
Baird as Lorin gave the most
enjoyable comic ones.

The only real production weak-
ness came at the very opening
of the play. Despite the first
tableau, the play begins too rap-
idly. Before the audience has
had a chance to take in the sit-
uation, it is deluged with a rapid
and wordy exchange between Ana-
tol and Max.

Technically, however, this play
is superb. The sets remind one
very much of paper and ink draw-

ings and were most impressive.
Music for the production was
recorded at the Museum ofMusic

, in Scarsdale, New York. The

tapes were made of songs play.
ed on an Automatic Cremona
Theatre Orchestra, which is a
device resembling a player piano,
producing the sounds of twenty
different instruments. Antique
furniture completes the scen-
ic virtuosity.

It Is difficult to draw con-
clusions about a play like "The
Affairs of Anatol” except to
say that it was skillfully present-
ed. and on the whole an enjoy-
able production. Ultimately one
must admit, that the play itself
is not much.

 

Jullllsni String Trlo

The Julliard String Quartet
Concert in Page Hall last Fri-
day night, March 16, was one of
the better concerts sponsored
by Music Council. The group liv-
ed up to any preconceived expec-
tations of the audience.

The selections varied from
two selections by classical com-
posers — Mozart’s Quartet in
D Minor, k. 173, and Beethov-
en's Quartet in A Minor, Opus
132, to a modern piece, Quartet
No. 4, Opus 37 by Schoenberg.

The Mozart and Beethoven se-
lections had audience appeal be-
cause of their melodic quality
and musical unity. The most im.
pressive things about the entire
concern were the superb balance
of all four instruments, the sen-
sitivity of the players to the dy-
namics, the rich tone quality of
the instruments, and the precise
executions ,and endings of each
movement. The control, unity and
precision of the style of the play-
ers was especially noted in the
molto adaglo — andante move-
ment of the Beethoven piece,
where Robert Mann, the first
violinist had a sustained high
note to be played with a slowly
drawn bow, to which he added
the slightest vibrato —- three
elements which demand rigid con-
trol in order for the ending to
result light and airy.

The Schoenberg Quartet No. 4,

Opus 37, was appealing for its
technical aspects. In contrast to
the Beethoven and Mozart pieces
which were characterized by
beauty, regular rhythm patterns
and symetrical design, the
Schoenberg piece showed irregu-
lar rhythm, intense pitch, dis-
sonant harmony and extreme
dynamics. Arnold Schoenberg, a
Vienese composer of the 20th
century, established the "tone
row" or the 12 tones of the
chromatic scale as the funda-
mentals of a new musical lang-
uage, sometimes referred to as
dodecaphony. His music is pow.
erful and expressive. The piece
was characterized by the bold
staccato of all four instruments,
syncopation, dotted rhythm, dis-
sonant chords and enharmonica.
The effect of the contrasting dy-
namics was enhanced by the use
of mutes, and the interesting var-
iation of pizzacato, staccato,
bouncing bows and the use of
the wood part of the bows over
the strings.

The audience, made up of a
disproportunate number of fac-
ulty members over students ,was
very receptive to the group. All
in all the Julliard StringQuartet,
consisting of Robert Mann, first
violin, Earl Carlyss, second vio-
lin, Raphael Hillyer, viola, and
Claus Adams, cello, was a mag-
nificent success.

Intermedia ’68: Audience
Participation At Its Best

by Robert B. Cutty

INTERMEDIA '68 is intended
primarily to exposcstudents to
all the various new theories
that have arisen in the different
arts. Thus, one of the main con-
cepts that the program has been
and will continue to be empha-
sizing is "mixed media.”

Last Wednesday, the first of
the "artists" scheduled to per-
form in the INTERMEDIA series
arrived. No, he did not himself
perform at all, he merely ar-
rived. (Which is to say, he de-
monstrated an appearance rather
than an act, play, concert, art
showing, or what-have-you).

This person, Dick Higgins, di-
rected, conducted, and super-
vised the audience in various
sketches of dubious artistic
worth and little comprehensible
meaning or importance. (1
again repeat, Higgins did no-
thing himself but join in what
the audience was doing).

This is what the audience per-
formed: a “Giant Flute Ensem-
ble" (the audience “overblew”
a lot of cheap, Chinatown wood
flutes); a “Giant Dance En-
semble" (the audience performed
various exercises to some cle-
verly ironic music selections).

A "Giant Silk Screen En-
semble" (the audience, “coor-
dinated by Alison Knowles," Hig-
gins' wife, printed some silk
screen designs on a plain white
bolt of poster paper); a “Giant
Examination Ensemble" (the aud-
ience wrote down questions on
“any subject" and Higgins read
these "thoughts" back to them).

"The Giants" (the audience
was given some two hundred-or-
so lit incense sticks and they
waved these around in the dark
like uninhibited children for
nearly a quarter of an hour).
Then the audience helped Hia-
gins in a “Clean-Up, performed
and coordinated by Dick Hig-
gins n

In other words, Higgins' per-
formance consisted simply in
describing to the audience num-
ber of “group art happenings"
that they should perform. This
of course implies a absolute
lack of talent on liiggins' part.
(Higgins, however, does write;
his “printing songs" are just
that: lectures on printing).

Further, if these writings are
any exmnple of the only "talent"
he does possess, then it is clear
that my supposition is entirely
correct. Truly, one can say of
Higgins' appearance that its
artistic merit depended on how
successful the audience was in
entertaining the performer.

And, then, of course, there
were Korean “composer C?) and
musician (7)" Nam June Paik
and cellist Charlotte Moorman,
who gave a concert last Saturday
night to a packed house (until
the intermission) in the Art Gal-
lery (kudos to the Gallery staff
for their patience).

Simple reporting of what took
place should suffice for anample
commentary. Entrance music
was played softly while the
audience entered. (Though they
couldn’t hear it, this was quite
all right, for Paik assured us
that this music "was written to
be not noticed").

One musical piece consisted
of a tape recording of the fir-
ing of guns, shells, cannons, and
rockets. in another, Miss Moor-
man merely struck, stroked, and
slouched all over her prostrate,
electrified (literally) cello.

Two other "numbers" were
so ridiculously executed as to be
completely unbelievable: in the
“Cut Piece" the audience was
invited to cut up Miss Moor-
man’s dress (admirably cheap
in expense).

For the "Variations No. 2

on a Theme by Saint Sirens”
the “variations” consisted of
Miss Moorman's getting up in
the middle of the playing of
the theme and immersing her-
self in an oil drum filled with
water; than, dripping wet, she
finished playing the theme.

1n “instrumental Music,"
Miss Moorman lay on the stage
while her cello was mounted upon
her. Paik then covered her with
a red cloth and had the lights
turned out; during this interval
of time, Paik conducted a “pray-
er for peace by having the
audience open and close its eyes
for several minutes.

One doesn't know who to con-
demn more: Paik, after all, got
a lot of laughs, but Higgins'
group art happenings were un-
conventional enough to please
some of the small audience,
though only for a short time.

 

Where Is Music Going?

Fourth Time Around

by Igor Korolult

 

 

 

1 don't know if it is just me,
but it seems as if there is
nothing exciting happening in the
realm of popular music. We have
been so bombarded with new
styles, groups, and innovations,
that I think we have become call-
ous to it all; and, as for me,
I am looking for a new direc-
tion.

West Coast has had its day
with its fug, feedback, and funk.
Every new group has incorpor-
ated those readily identifiable
aspects of the sound so that
what was creative has now he-
come standard, if not a cliche.

Of the valid groups, only the
Cream and Beatles have shown
any inspiration in recent weeks.
“Lady Madonna" could be the
only new sound around, and it
probably is the best Beetle re-
lease since "Strawberry
Fields."

what’s happened to the Doors?
Why is Jefferson Airplane so
hung up on that one sound? Why
are album covers getting better
while the inside products seems
to deteriorate?

Finally, I think it is a case
of over—exposure, and the music
business, especially album pro-
ducers (with a few very import.-
nnt exceptions), has become so
commercially oriented that the
consumer is not getting a chance
to hear or be heard.

For example, Capitol Records
released an album with Jimi
Hendrix and Curtis Knight with
a picture of Hendrix and his
name dropped over the cover.
Well, the album is a dud—Hen-
drix was nothing more than a
sessions man and the quality of
the cuts could be called mediocre
at best.

Capitol saw it as a good money

making venture to capitalize on
Hendrix’s success by pulling out
some of these old tapesand push-
ing them off on the buying public.
Beware, even the big record
companies do not necessarily

Aldo Tambellini will be the next
performing artist in the lNTER.
MEDIA '68 series. The former
ltalian citizen will present a
"Black Media" show in the As-
sembly Hall of the Campus Cen-
ter on Wednesday, March 26, at
8:00 p.m.

Tambellini was born in Syra-
cuse, N.Y. in 1930, but lived in
Italy during his childhood. After
studying at‘the Lucca Art Insti-
tute, he returned to the United
States in 1946.

Tambellini has received
B.F.A.'s in painting from Syra-
cuse University and the School
of Architecture and Allied Arts
of the University of Oregon. His
M.F.A. in sculpture was awarded
fi'om Notre Dame. Tambellini has
taught at the Catholic University
of America in Washington, D.C.
and Pratt Institute.

Tambellini has used primarily
television to express his crea-
tive ideas. In December of 1907,
ABC-TV presented his “Black
TV" which used two televisions
simultaneously for a complete
“audio-visual bombardment" of
the home audience.

The Howard Wise Gallery, as
part of their "Festival of
Lights," from December, 1967
to January, 1968, presented
"Black Video 1." In this show,
Tambellini was specifically con-
cerned with developing his "Elec-
tromedia” ideas, which involve
