Saturday afternoon — March 9-
the first session of the National
Pairs Championship — andanew
partnership has been formed.
Edgar Kaplan of the US Inter-
national team is playing with
Richard Betz. Beta is a student
at the University.

They are playing together as
a result of a contest run by
“Bridge World." A bidding se-
quence and one of the hands
were given the object being to
deduce the other hand. Betz
guessed Kaplan's hand to the
exact spot cards.

This writer sat next to Betz
for the opening session from
which today's hand was taken.

Kaplan was north, Betz south,
and although the new pair didn't
do extremely well overall, Betz
had his moments and this was one.

The game was match points,
so overtricks are very important.

_ Through a good line of play and

some nice deception, Betz
managed to make four heart on
the hand.

The play went as follows:
diamond lead ruffed, ace of
hearts, heart to dummy's queen
and East's king. The diamond

Now come the key. For his
double, West figures to have the

end-played. But before this can be
done, Betz had to steal a club
trick. So he led the club tenfrom

West, thinking his partner
might have the queen,played low.
Now a spade toward dummy’s

A diamond ruff put Betz back on
lead, and he led his last trump.

Now, west had come down to
four cards. He chose to throw
his last diamond, keeping ace
and another spade and king and
another club, but he Was finished.
Ace of clubs followed by the
queen put him on lead and Beta

Lacrosse Club Looks
Toward New Season

The Albany State Lacrosse
Club has been working out for
several weeks. Fifty-five men
signed up for the clubandtwenty-
eight to thirty have been attend-
ing the workouts regularly.

Coach Silvey is pleased with
the turnout. lie feels the clubhas
a good number of experienced
players and many of tile incxper.
fenced players are making fine
progress.

The experienced players in-
clude Mike Baroletta, Jim Flan-
Igan, Steve Jackaway and Kevin
Shechan on attack and Mark Wer-
der, Dan Grencn and Bruce Sand
at midfield. There are no exper—
ienced dcfcnsemeil, but Dave Ric-
gel, Mike Drexel, Mike Goldych
and Mike Warner show promise
at this position. Larry Smith, a

converted attack player and Joel
Aroeste are most likely to play
goalie. The club has not scrim-
maged as yet and starting play-
ers and their positions are not
definite.

Games are tentatively sched-
uled with the Union Frosh away,
April 17; the CobleskillLacrosse
Club at home April 27; the R.P.l.
Fresh at home May 1; Tri Cit-
ies Lacrosse Club at home May
4; Stone Frosh at home May l1;
and with Cobleskill away May 18.
The club is negotiating for addi-
tional games.

Mr. Silvey feels that the team
is working hard. He looks for-
ward to a successful season and
the development of the lacrosse
club into a hill-fledged varsity
team.

Spring Soccer Starts
Boaters Victorious

Coach Bill Schieffelin was ex-
tremely happy with the perform-
ances of his two seven man
teams In Sunday's indoor soccer
tournament held at the Washing-
ton Ave. Armory In Schenectady.

The tournament included ten
teams; two each from the Amity
Soccer Club of Schenectady, and
Albany State University, and
one each from Little Falls, Utica,
Amsterdam and RPI. The Albany
Sports Club, and the Albany Sons
of Italy were also represented.

"A" Team Wins 2-l

The Great Danes A team pull-
ed a real upset In their opener
as they downed the Little Falls
squad by a 2-1 count, with Phil
Kahn and Craig Springer scor-
ing for Albany. The A team was
eliminated in the second round
by a strong Amsterdam squad,
but their one win was very en—
couraging in view of the fact
that the majority of the opposi-
tion were foreign born, highly
experienced soccer players.

Tlli' Albany State B team was

eliminated in the first round,
but so was the powerful RPI
contingent.

Although the games were rath-
er informal, with only fifteen
mInute halls, and no kickoffs,
it was a good opener for Al-
bany's new spring soccer pro-
gram. The squad presently
is planning on 7 or 8 practice
games with Union, RPl and Hud-
son Vauey, starting late in April
and continuing through May.

Schieiielin pleased

Coach Schieffelin's comments
on the program were all favor-
able. He stated tint the program
has the team thinking soccer,
working with weights and run~
nlng at a time when they used
to have to work entirely on their
own.

Obviously this sort ofprogram
can only help, as it gives the
freshmen prospects a chance to
be incorporated into the line-
up well before the official start-
ing date some time next fall.

 State Sports Ten Lettermén  C

Catcher'IIs Biggest PrOblem

by Jim Winslow

With the spring sports season fast approaching, coach Bob Burlingame’s baseball
lettermen and hopefuls are beginning to appear on the Albany State diamonds. Their
first game only little over three weeks away, the team roster is beginning to take
shape. It centers around 10 returning lettermen; five pitchers, three infielders and
two outfielders. Heading the list are the two senior Ice-captains, Denny Elkin and Jim

Murley.

Itlkin, a two - letter
man. is the solid short-
stop for Burlingame's
starting nine. Denny also
serves time at first base
and is available for spot
pitching. He will bebatilng clean-
up and the coach has dubbed
him "my best long-ball hitter."
Murley is a'transfer from Hud-
son VaIley Community College
last year; he and Elkln combin-
ed for a team high of 15 runs
batted in. Known as the “flee”
to his teammates, Jim will lead
off and play centerfield.

Sinnott Most Valuable

Leading the infield Iettermen
ls junior first baseman Jack
Sinnott. Jack was voted the
"Most Valuable Player” of last
year's squad. He led the team
with a batting average which
coach Burlingame called, “not
spectacular, but decent."

Returning at the second base
position is senior Paul Leonettl.
Paul, is atransferfrom Rockland
Community College, at the endoi'
his sophomore year. whose men-
tor chilracterlzcs him as “the
best glove man we have." Paul
will most likely but set-0nd.

Stein Breaks into Lineup

The other outfielder returning
is junior Art Stein, the super-
sub of last year's team who
ended up starting almost every
game for an injured or sick
regular.

Pitching Strong Point

The pitching corps is the
strongest point on the squad,
sporting five returnees.

Heading the list of chuckers
is senior Torn Egelston, a right
hander whose specialty is heat-
ing Rensselaer Polytechnic ln-
stltute. He has beaten them
twice in two years while regis-
tering only one other victory.

Another senior with the most

Gﬂlkﬂ Best Percentage

impressive won-loss average last
year (3-2) is Cas Galka. Cas,
a right hander, transferred to
State from Hudson Valley along
with Jim Murley.

George Webb, another righty,
returns with a string of "tough
luck" decisions behind him. Af-
ter shutting out Brooklyn Col-
lege last year, George pitched
one run ball against powerful
Central Connecticut State for
nine frames only to lose when
be tired in the tenth.

Senior Tom Plotrowski heads
the list of left handors. Tom
is mainly used as u reliever and
will probably continue in that
capacity.

Smooth-working Richie Patrei
rounds out the letter winners.
Coach Burlingame looks for
Richie to be much improved over
last year after playing some
fine summer ball.

The entire gym, the pool included is now open for the stu-

dents to get in shape.

New Athletic Building
Has Many Facilities

The Physical Education Bulld-
lng which lusluet opened isa $3.5
million complex which offers a
wide choice of activities to the
student.

The Main Gym, which will be
used for all varsity events, has
a total floor space of 112' x 174'
with all the bleachers foldedback
into the wall. For varsity com.
petition, the bleachers are roll-
ed lnto position and offer a seat-
ing capacity of 3,000 people. For
open activity and lntramurals,
however, the gym will luvethree
full-length basketball courts, 5
volleyball courts, and 0 bad-
minton courts. in order to ac.
commodate the members of the
press during athletic contests,
there is a special press box
at one end of the center court.

Swimming Pool Impros sive

A second outstanding aspect of
this building is its collegiate-
size swimming pool. Measuring
76x43 feet, the pool has a cape-
city of 200,000 gallons of water
which circulate at the rate of
4,030 gallons a minute. For var-
sity competition, the pool is set
up with six racing lanes as well
as two one-meter diving boards
and one three-meter board.

To supplement the main gym,
there are also two auxiliary gyms
which will be used primarily for
gymnastic activities, including
rope climbing, ﬂying rings,
trampolines and other activities.
In addition to these facilities,
there is also a special wrestlo
ing room for the practicing and
conditioning of the teams.

Facilities Varied

The diversity of facilities is
further exemplified by the pres.
ence of a dance studio room,
four handball courts, four squash
courts, and two special exercise
rooms, one of which houses an
exercising apparatus which can
be used by anyone wishing to

improve the i'imditioltol‘hfs liodyi"

The men’s locker room has fa-
cilities for 1,300 students, plus
four varsity sports and three
visiting team locker rooms. The
women's locker room has 2,500
lockers plus one home and one
visiting team room.

Also included is a complete
training room with facilities for
handbag as many types of infur-
ies as could conceivably come
up during the course of a sea-
son. There are also two dif-
ferent class rooms for physical
education classes and enough of-
flce space to satisfy the needs
of the entire athletic staff.

Probably the most important
aspect of this building is that
the coaches and staff have final-
ly teached the point where all
the particular facilities are cen-
tralized into one location. With
this centralisation, it will be
much easier for the coaches to
co-ordinate not only their coach-
ing efforts, but also their re-
cruitlng.
