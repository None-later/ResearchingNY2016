Scheduling was the number one topic at the sports-
writers luncheon held at the Campus Center on Monday.
As everyone knows, the scheduling controversy stems
from the fact that our basketball team was denied an
NCAA regional berth because of its “weak” Schedule.

This problem is indeed a serious one. The present
schedules are certainly not of the cream-puff variety.
The soccer team takes on Bridgeport, and other pOWers,
and the cross country team faces LeMoyne annually,
and has Cornell set for next year. The wrestling team
also takes on several perennial powerhouses, including
Maritime, Cortland and Montclair, while the basketball
team regularly beats the state schools whose conference
winner gets an automatic NCAA bid. Also included on the

schedule this season were Williams, U.B.. Ithaca, and
Central and Southern Connecticut. Unfortunately this was
not good enough for the selection committee; they would
obviously like to see us go big time, but that is easier
said than done. The ivy League schools snub us as a
mere state school, and others, at some distance, seem
to feel that the trip is not worth it. Although both ex-
cuses are lame ones the fact remains that they are
used, and it will take some time to counteract them.
Obviously a “big time" schedule cannot be achieved
over night. ‘

Although our basketball team has been highly success-
ful recently, another question about high powered schedul-
ing must be considered. How far can we go without
athletic scholarships? Doc Sauers has been very fortun-
ate recently, as he has gathered some top notch talent in
the past few years, but there is no guarantee that the
same talent will be forthcoming indefinitely. Coach Garcia
had a fine wrestling team last year, but this season he ran
into hard times.

Recruiting at this school is certainly not easy. How
would you like to try to find: honor roll students who
are good enough to get full scholarships, and can also be
convinced to come to Albany. This, is a tall order.

And from the looks of things, there is little financial
help in the offing. The trustees of the State University
recently came out ﬂatly against the "distortion" that
would result from athletic scholarships, and the Alumni
have neither the money nor the motivation. This is cer-
tainly an unfortunate situation, for without athletic
scholarships, the University will expand and the sports
program will be left behind.

The problem apparently is to provide a means of fund-
ing scholarships that does not result in “distortion.”
This would call for a reorganization, and revitalization
of the present scholarship set-up, but such a revision
might not be such a bad idea.

As the competition for outstanding students increases
and the University improves, the sports departments
dilemma may become more universal. The low tuition and
improving faculty are bound to draw top notch students,
but the really exceptional students will continue to be
attracted to the prestigious private schools, where they
will be offered full scholarship grants.

Thus it might be a good idea to start a full payment
scholarship program for the entire State system, with
say 50 or more scholarships for each University Center,
to be distributed at the discretion oi the school. These
grants might all be given strictly on the grounds of
academic excellence, or some of them could bemeted out
to the various departments. This way the art, music, and
dramatic arts departments would all be able to attract
students who met the entrance requirements, and also
showed outstanding promise in these non-academic areas.
While, a further expansion of this concept could result in
scholarships in such fields as communications, or even
athletics.

Obviously this policy calls for a drastic revision of the
state's scholarship program, but if it were incorporated
into the present regents scholarship program, it might
lessen the hit and miss nature of the present policy.

Future

by Don Oppedisono

Despite the disappointment
over not being selected to play
in the NCAA Northeastern Re-
gional Tournament, the Albany
state basketball team can look
back on the 1867-68 season with
the pride which comes with the
knowledge of a job well done.
Further, the underclassmen, fans
and coach Dick Sauers can look
forward to next year, when a
solid returning nucleus should
produce another strong team.

Two school records were brok-
en, three tied and one extended
by this winter’s 18-4 club. Rich
Margison, Albany's 6-1 junior
star from Cortland and who was
recently named to the Divison 2
ECAC All-East squad, account-
ed for several of the changes in
the record book. His 185 field
goals erased the old mark of 183
set by Don Cohen seven years
ago and his 16 field goals against
Pratt tied Gary l-lolway’s stan-
dard established in 1957. In ad-
dition, Rich extended his streak
of scoring double figures to 43
games, becoming the second play-
er to hit twin digits every game
two different years.

Albany's 14 consecutive victor-
ies, achieved over atwo-end-one-
half month period, scratched the
record of 12 straight by the 1964-
65 club. By topping the century
mark three times, this year’s
team equalled the accomplish-
ments of their 1958-59 predeces-
sors. Finally, the team's winning
season marked the 13th straight
year of .500 or better basketball
at Albany, extending that record.

Margison, whose 514 points
and 23.4 scoring average both
were second best in Albany his-
tory, will head an impressive
list of returning veterans for
the 1966-69 campaign. Also com-
ing back are starters Scott Price
who avenged 15.9 points and 11.4
rebounds a game and Jack Adams
who averaged 10 ppg his
sophomore season. In addition,
Bob Wood who was scoring 10.7
PPS as a starter, before being
sidelined after the season's ninth
game, should be back next year,
along with 6-1 junior Jim Caver-
ly who averaged 7.0 as a reserve
and saw as much action as most
of the regulars.

This year’s freshmen willalso
make some valuable contri-
butions. Jack Jordan hit for a
24 point per game average, and
could become a valuable asset.
While Jim Doyle and Joel Volin-
ski may also help out.

Potter Bombs Shafts
Remain Unscored Upon

Ray McCloat led the way with
a 591 triple last Saturday as
the Potter club keglers remain-
ed unbeaten, registering an im-
pressive 7-0 win over the pre-
viously unbeaten Shaffts. In this
head to head battle of the lead-
ers Potter came through in fly-
ing colors, as all five bowlers
hit 500 or better.The match real-
ly was not even close. Potter
took the first game by an over-
whelming 871 to 635, the Shafts
were closest in the second game,
but not close enough as Potter
won by a 37 pin margin. in the
final game. The Clubscored very
well again, winning by an im-
pressive 916-853 count.

APA also faired pretty well
as they scored two perfect 7—0
wins last week to jump from
fifth to third in the standings.
John Naumowitz led the way for
APA as he recorded a phenome-
ml 673 triple, far and away the
best score recorded to date.

education at the University.

Science, Society Study
At New Center Here

One of the main goals the
new Center for Science and Hu-
man Affairs hopes to accomplish
is “the development of a Uni-
versity organization that can util-
ize the interest of various
groups of people for the purpose
of solving current problems in-
volving science and society."

At a press conference held
Wednesday afternoon in the
Executive Room of the Thruway
Motor Inn session leaders of the
five-day conference on "The
Scientific Revolution — lts Im-
pact on Man and Society" were
asked what direction future study
would take.

In reply, Dr. Eugene Rabino-
witch, one of the conferencelead-
ers and editor of “The Bulletin
of Atomic Scientists,” said that
problems of the world and the
nation, in addition to those rais-
ed by Congressman Daddario at
the opening address and. gener-
ally, problems of human habitat
such as the crowding will be dis-
cussed and results acted upon.

Dr. McTaggart-Cowan, Presi-
dent of Simon Fraser University
and governor of the Arctic 1n-
stltute of North America, said
that the “conference has identi-
fied a whole spectrum of prob-
lems. Where will we start? 13y
coming to the people who will
select starting points."

The subject of informing the
public was brought up and one of
the session leaders was concern-
ed with how the public would get
unbiased information on science
issues of major importance. lie
said, "They won't get it from
newspapers."

Dr. Bentley Glass, President-
elect of the American Associa-
tion for the Advancement of
Science and Academic Vice Pres.
at Stony Brook, was concerned
with l'how technical change which
grows out of scientific advance
can be introduced without disrupb
ing the nature of society."

For these reasons, ihe”neces—
sity of studying problems,
dangers and disadvantages" re-
sulting from technological ad-
vance is obvious.

Rabinowitch added that the
"whole problem of science and
society is how to minimize the
damage of the Supersonic boom.
This is not so obvious to every-
one."

It is generally agreed among

the session leaders that the edu-
cation of the general public was
necessary so they would be in-
terested in finding out the news
affecting them. The general
public must be given significant
information so they may make
intelligent judgments about what
portion of a program is worth-
while.

Rablnowitch brought out the
point that the scientist must act
as a citizen and not only as a
hard core scientist in agreement
with this, McTaggart-Cowan said
that "the role ofthe socialscient-
151 is becoming increasingly im-
portant in portraying the results

   Faculty, Students Review,

ReviseUndergrad Ed. Report

by Ira Woltmon
Sta/f [fr-porter

Students and Faculty members
of the University were given an
opportunity to review and revise
aspects of the second draft of the
Curriculum report entitled“New
Patterns in Undergraduate Edu-
cation" at a special seminar
which was open to the public.

The report concerns itselfwith
a set of proposals and suggestions
dealing with the future of the
University. it was produced by a
special committee appointed by
the Undergraduate Academic
Council, who have been at work
on this report since January of
1967.

President Evan R. Collins pre-
sided over the seminar, at which
over 150 students and faculty
were in attendance. During the
course of the two and a half
hour session, the report was ex-
plored and criticized by those
present.

Dean 0. William Perlmutter,
who wrote the second draft ofthe
report, stated in his address to
the seminar that "this is a Uni-
versity which is going to be
watched with interest nation-
wide." He admitted that “not all
of the ideas in the report are
new, but all have merit." Hethen
outlined for the audience the five
main proposals of the report: the
three year master’s program, the
general College, the Department-
al program, the proposal for in-
creased outlets for independent
study, and the Experimental Col-
lege.

it was suggested that each pro-
posal be taken as separate en.
titles. Debate was opened on the
proposals by a discussion of the
three years master’s. After
sufficient discussion had en-

Relate Drugs

by Carl Lindeman

The concern over marijuana
and other haullucinogens on cam-
pus were recently discussed by
Dr. Clifton Thorne, Vice-Presi-
dent of Student Affairs, Dr.Janet
Hood, Director of Health Serv-
ice, and Chandler Stein, Legal
Counselor on campus.

The discussions centered
around the administrative, medi.
cal and legal aspects of the prob-
lem. The discussions also were
designed to aid in eliminating
many of the misconceptions about
drugs on campus and the prob-
lems associated with their pres.
ence on campus.

In regard to undercover agents
operating on campus, Dr.Thorne
stated that he was "not in favor
of undercover agents on campus
unless the academic community,
that is, students and faculty, de.
termine that they had a problem
that couldn't be solved in any
other way.” lle added that he
"would be extremely disappoint-
ed if 1 would find any.“

Undercover agents were de-
fined as anyone who investigates
an organization without the or.
ganization’s knowledge of their
investigation.

Relations between the Univer-
sity and law enforcement agenc-
les were cited as excellent by
Thorns. According to Thorns,
local law enforcement agencies
were invited to the campus in
the fall of 1860. Since then the

Civil Law

narcotic agents have been re-
quested 10 come on campus once
to investigate the use of drugs.
However, no arrests were made.
Thorne emphasized that the

sued, President Collins asked for
a consensus of the audience's
opinions of each of the proposed
ideas. One could either feel
"more favorably than not,” “ob-
ject strongly," or "support en-
thusiastically" each respective
proposal.

In general, there was good re-
ception of each of the proposals.
All five of them were favored

by a majority of those present.
while only the Experimental Col-
lege received more than a hand-
ful of opposing votes. Great en-
thusiasm was displayed for the
Independent study proposal,
shown by the fact that over half
of those present indicated that
they were strongly in favor of it.

Kennedy, McCarthy
Drives Begin Campaign

A“ organizational meeting of
the "State Students for Kennedy"
was attended by close to 200 stu-
dents last Monday night,

About the same number of stu-
dents were present at the initial
rally Wednesday evening for Mo-
Carthy. M.J. Rosenberg, a junior

here, was the prime initiator of ~

the mnetlnl! for Kennedy.

The meeting was held primar-
ily to establish the groundwork
of a campus wide campaign in
conjunction with a Robert F‘.
Kennedy for President move-
ment.

Rosenberg opened a short ad-
dress by stating that, "The Ken-
nedy campaign has begun at Al-
bany State." He then went into
an explanation of the purposes and
aims of the organization.

The primary objective of this
group presently is, according to
Rosenberg, “to win the State Uni.
versity at Albany for Kennedy in
the Choice '68 election." He was
referring to the coming "Col-
legiate Presidential Primary" to
be held April 25th. The names of
all the prospective presidential
candidates will be listed on this
ballot.

Rosenberg stated that the rea-
son for the establishment of this
group is that, "if a sizable num-
ber of votes is recorded for
R.F.K. on the college campuses
nationwide, it will show the pub-
lic that the intellectual commun-
ity of the United States is behind
Kennedy."

The plans for the group in the
near future include the establish-

ment of a table in the Campus
Center where political materials,
(i.e., buttons, posters, etc.) will
be offered to students.

Contact has presently been
made with Senator Kennedy’s
N.Y. Senatorial office and his na-
tional office in Washington.

After the foundation has been
completed, representatives will
be appointed in each dorm to in-
form the residents of further
activities.

Present at the meeting was
the Regional Director for the
Kennedy Campaign in the Capitol
District. He gave out to a few
student representatives a peti-
tion that is to be signed by pro-
fessors who support Kennedy's
entrance into the race. The peti-
tion in part reads:

"We welcome Senator Robert
F. Kennedy's decision to seek the
Democratic Party's nomination
for President. . . We supporthim
in his effort."

This, it is hoped, will be part
of an ad to be placed in the New
York Times for Robert 1“, Ken-
nedy by college professors
across the nation.

Rosenberg’s reaction to the
response of the student body——
"I was thrilled at the large turn-
out of students tonight.” He asked
that all students who attended the
meeting be patient until they are
contacted. He also asked that all
who did not attend and are inter-
