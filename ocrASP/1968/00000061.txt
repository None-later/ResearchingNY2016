Record Budget 0f $247 Thousand
Approved By Central Council

by Vic Loaper
Sta/7 Reporter

Central Council approved all
the budgets of Living Area Af-
fairs Commission (LAAC), Aca-
demic Affairs Commission
(AAC), Religious Affairs Com-
mission (RAC), Central Council
and Dramatics Council at its
Thursday, May 21 meeting. The
Grand Total of Appropriation so
far is $174,000.

Council has budged $5,000 for
LAAC, $5,000 for AAC, $390
for RAC, $15,000 for Council
and $11,000 for Dramatics Coun-
cil, for a $36,000 total. The
Grand Total oi all budgets is
$247,000.

Council’s actual approriations
totaled $1,000, $3,000, $310, $15,-
000, $8,000 and $27,000 total
respectively. The difference be-
tween the totai budget and the
appropriations will be made up
by income lines of $4,000, $2,000,
$80, $0, $3,000 and $9,000 re-
spectively.

The grand total of $174,000
appropriations for the fiveCom-
missions and Council compares
with a total appropriation for all
Student Association (SA) groups
of $152,000 for the present fiscal
year, '67-88.

All the above and following
facts and figures are based on the
original budgets as passed by
Council last year and do not re-
flect any additional approriations
or newly budgeted groups. Un-
less otherwise stated, the term
budget will hereinafter be defin-
ed as appropriation.

The MYSKANIA budget was
tabled so the new MYSKANlA
could present their own budget
with consideration of their plans
for 1968-69.

Campus Carnival (State Fair),
Campus Chest and Smiles were
tabled so that a newly appointed
Committee on Solicitations could
present a report. The members
of the Committee are: Sue Chapc,
Allen Cohen, Student Activities
Advisor Miss Alice Corbin, V. [7.
Paul Downes, Special Events
Board Chm. Nick Dugo, ’i‘crry
Mathias, and CFO Chm. Mildred
Poisenskl.

With the exception of Central
Council there were no increases
of more than $1,000. Council had
an increase of $2,740 from $12,-
440 to $15,180. This was due to
mainly to an increase from $3,-
000 to $0,000 in Council's Emer-
gency Spending Line (ESL). Coun-
cil decreased most of its bud-
getary lines and eliminated ono
entirely.

The ESL. in used to cover ex-
penses and extra appropriations
of items, programs, etc. that
were not thought of when the bud.
get was presented. This line also
funds newly formed groups. The
line is usually budgeted too low,
therefore, the usual procedure
is to run the line in the red.

An amendment to Council's
budget was passed to give the
Vice-President a salary of $200.
The only question asked was if
the MP. worked more than 30

hours a week. As stated in the
Finance Policy a person must
work 30 hours a week in order
to be granted a salary. The ques-
tion was answered in theaffirma-
live.

The ASP's four sub-editors
were also granted a $200 salary
when their budget was presented.
They also work more than 30
hours a week.

There are now 12 SA salaried
positions. They are: the Presi-
dent and V. P. of SA, the co-
editors and four sub-editors of
the ASP, the co-edltors of the
Torch, and the General Manager
and Chief Engineer of WSUA.

The total appropriations for
these positions are $3.600.

When LAAC’s budgets were
discussed, Paul Bresiin, the
LAAC representative, made a
motion to reduce each Quads
income lines by $100. This was
the consensus of LAAC because
they felt that the income lines
were too high and could never

be met.

Budget Committee had set the
line for Social Events equal to
the income lines. This Would
mean that the Quad would have
to break even on all their events
in order to meet the income
line.

There were two increases in
AAC's budgets and also two
riders attached to Beta Beta
Beta’s budget, the Biology Honor—
ary. The riders involved non-
SA members of the honorary and
coffee hours for SA members.

The Dramatics Council budget
caused a great deal of discus-
sion. CPC had held an investiga-
tion to establish the relationship
between Dramatics and State
University Theatre. The budget
was decreased from $7,920 to
$7,502.50.

Council also appropriated $2,.
060.25 from Athletic Advisory
Board's surplus to pay for meals
for the Spring Sports during
Spring Recess.

ApplicatiOnSReady

For Fall Housing

Applications for on-campus
housing for continuing, single un-
dergraduates are now available
in the Housing Office, Fulton
Hall, Suite 103 and in all real-
dence hails.

Four items must be completed
before the student's application
can be processed: resident ap-
plication and contract card,resi-
deuce hall personal information
card, business office Z-part card,
and $25 advance rental deposit.

When the Housing Office re-
ceives the above information and
rental deposit, the contract for
the entire ’68-'09 academic year
is in effect and, thereafter, re-
quests for moving off campus
will not be honored.

Students planning to live off-
campus or commute are requir-
ed to file a local address form at
preregistration although . their
local address for Fall may not yet
be known.

Completed application forms
and the $25 advance rental fee
will be accepted beginning Mon-
day, April 22 on a priority basis
similar to that established last
year. Seniors (to he) will turn in
residence forms Monday and
Tuesday, April 22, 23; Juniors
(to be), Tuesday and Wednesday,
April 23, 24; Sophomores (lobe),
Wednesday and Thursday, April
24, 2.); and Greeks, Thursday
and Friday, April 25, 26.

Priority for choosing of rooms
will be again based on seniority
and return to the same residence
hall. A point system will be used
with suite groups having the
least number of total points in
their size (4,5,6 members) clas-
sification choosing first.

The numerical assignment be-
gins with seniors returningto the
same hall receiving one point,
seniors changing halls, two and
so on similarly through juniors
and sophomores.

2,621 spaces are available for
fall for continuingupperclassmen
and new transfer students. The
men’s halls and numbers of
spaces open in each are: Clinton

University To Have Blood Drive;
To Be Sponsored By

A national Red Cross Blood
Center will be located in the
Campus Center on Tuesday, May
’7, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The
blood drive, sponsored by the
brothers of Alpha P1 Alpha Fra-
ternity, will depend mainly on
the support of the student body
and other members ofthe Univer-
slty.

Since donors under 21 between
the ages of 18 and 21 must ob-
tain permission from their pa-
rents to give blood, permission
slips will be distributed on the
dinner lines during this coming
week.

Students are asked by Hank
Rabinowits, chairman ofthehiood
drive, to send the slips home for
their parents’ signatures. Collec-
tion boxes will be set up in each
dorm for signed slips to be de-
posited in.

Donors over 21 will also be
able to obtain sign up slips on the
dinner lines. Permission-sign up
slips will be made available to
students, faculty, administration
and staff next week at the in-
formation desk in the Campus
Center.

On the hack of each permis-
sion-sign up Slip, the donor is
asked to indicate what hours bu.
tween 10 and 4 he will be free on
May 7. Collection boxes will re~
main in the dorms from next
week to the weekend before the
drive.

A donor can benefit by know-
ing that his family as well as his
own hood needs will be met with-
out charge for thohlood itscifand
without the necessity of getting
replacement donors.

Furthermore, the contributors
make available to physicians:
serum albumin for emergency
treatment ofshock; gamma globu.
lin for protection against hepa-

titis and other diseases: fibrino-
gen for control of hemorrhaging
in childbirth; vaccinia immune
globulin, the only specific treat-
ment for Severe complications
from small pox vaccination.

in line with recent blood donor
policy changes by the Red Cross
involving respiratory illness,
malaria and pregnancy the blood
drive will follow the following
regulations.

Donors must be free of acute
respiratory disease, such as
colds, grippe and flu, at the time
of the donation. if the donor has
ever had malaria, he is perman-
ently deferred. And, women are

APA

ineligible as blood donors dur-
ing pregnancy and for six months
after delivery, abortion or mis-
carriage.

Another change in the rules
deals with the upper age require-
ment for blood donors. The donor
age range now covers 18 through
61 years instead of the previous
18 through 00 years requirement.

This is the fraternity's second
blood drive. it is hoped by Rabin-
owitz that, in view ofthe increase
in the amount of people in the
total University Community, this
drive will be a greater success
than the one sponsored by the
fraternity two years ago.

cated contact him, M..i. Rosen-
berg, Delancey Hall, 472-8724.

McCarthy drew about thesame
number of students and, in some
cases, the same students. .

A leader of the local CDA was
present and gave a short speech.
He said that McCarthy had a
good chance of winning the
nomination, and, as far ashe
could see, McCarthy is the best.
candidate in line for the presi-
dency. I

The purpose of the meeting was
to encourage active support of
the students and active support
from the students in persuading
those registered Democrats to
vote for McCarthy lnthe primary
and at the polls in November.

He also said that he had pledg-
ed himself to McCarthy only and
would not support Kennedy un-
less McCarthy decided to do so.

Those attending the meeting
were given cards to indicate their
names and telephone numbers in
addition to what aspect of the
campaign they would like to work
on.

A storefront for McCarthy will
be established soon in Albanyand
students were invited to come and
help with canvassing, typing or
anything else downtown and on-
campus.

Students were invited to ask
questions and one asked if it was
possible to support both Kennedy
and McCarthy. The answer was
that this is perfectly all right.

Those present were invited to
stay and watch the film “Viet-
nam: How We Got in; How We
Can Get Out," featuring David
Schoenbrun. it was suggested that
this film would aid in under-
standing the views of McCarthy.

The film, because over 90 per
cent of the students remained
to see it, was shown in two
sessions.

Reporters and photographers
from local newspapers were also
present.

Collins Discusses Study;
Construction, Vandalism

by Tim Keeley
Sta/I Reporter

President Evan R. Collins dis-
cussed the recently published Un-
dergraduate Study and the con-
struction trends on campus at
the President’s Conference with
students on Monday.

President Collins commented
that most of the changes advo-
cated by the study would cost
money that was not yet budgeted.

The earliest possible timethat
such changes could financially
take place is in the fall of 1969.
Between now and that time the
Faculty Senate would also have to
approve such changes.

The tri-semester plan was also
discussed by President Collins
and students attendingthe confer-
ence. Under that system students
would take three courses each
of three semesters.

However. no new system could
be started, President Collins
pointed out, unless it was ap-
proved by the Faculty Senate sub-
committee on curriculum for un-
dergraduates.

Commenting about next year’s
school calendar President Col-
lins remarked, “it's aworse cai-
endar than 1 thought it was."
This comment was provoked in
regards to the number of teach-
ing days and also the absence of
a sizable intersesaion.

Student questions about con.
struction on campus prompted
President Collins to site expect-
ed completion dates.

"We are hopeful that six of
the large groupinatruction rooms
under the podium will be avail-
able for use in the fall," Presi-
dent Coiiins said. lie also antici-
pates the opening ofthe computer
center "early this slimmer."

The Theater Arts building is
expected to open on or around
October ill.

The architect's office recently
released their drawings of the
fourth residence quadrangle.

Bids will be going out within two
weeks.

once the contract is awarded
it is hoped that construction will
begin around May.

it was noted that vandalism
is evident on campus, according
to Collins such acts as just"stu-
pid destructivenesa" are costly.

“Such acts of vandalism can
not be curbed by increasing the
security force; the University
community must discourage stu-
dents from committing vandal-
ism,” closed Collins.

objected to the draft. They were:
i - To go into the Army and born
from within, 2 - Go to Canada,
3 - Practice some form of Civil
disobedience, preferably refusal
of induction.

Mr. Zimmerman gave the au-
dience a cautionary note on the
first alternative. He warned that
they would be entering a hostile
environment and might find the
situation very difficult. The sec-
ond alternative would remove the
individual from political re-
sponse, and there by make him
relatively ineffective.

Therefore Mr. Zimmerman's
personal preference would be
civil disobedience. But this type
of resistance would have to be
done in large numbers, and in-
volves a risk ofjail to the partici-
pant. in order for this to be done
on our campus it is necessary to
devise activities that will achieve
a sense of solidarity.

Mr. Zimmerman suggested
that the members first circulate
an “i won't go" statement to the
members of the University Com-
munity asking people to say they
will refuse induction if called by
their draft boards. The second
step would be to have a series
of workshops to discover who
would actually stick to the idea.
The third step would consist of
some kind ofa"GraduationCerc~

many" in which the"SummaCum
Laude” would be awarded to those
who turn in their cards.

Mr. Zimmerman then told his
audience, composed primarily of
faculty members and female stu-
dents, that they must be ready
to exert pressure on the presi-
dential candidates. Kennedy's
words, in particular must be
measured against his potential
actions.

KBClothcs Drive
For South End

Kappa Beta Fraternity is spon-
soring an All-University cloth-
ing Drive for the South End be-
ginning Wednesday, April 3 to
Tuesday, April 9.

Large corregated boxes will
be placed in each dorm's lower
lounge for use as a depository.
The chairman for the group, Paul
Lieberman urges all the students
to cooperate with this drive.

The purpose of the drive,
according to Loiberman, is to
make the student aware of one
of the many problems that exist
in the South End and to motivate
him to take action by participat-
ing in other projects.

it is hoped by Leiberman that
all students will give generously.

portant conclusion to be drawn
from this participation is I. non-
partisan one. “Namely that ef-
fective, articulate expression of
political opinion by students,
combined with theiractive parti-
cipation in the political process,
can significantly affect the out.
come of elections and the shape
of American politics."

Whitney Case
Decided-Guilty

The case of James Whitney
versus the People of the State
of New York came to a con-
clusion Wednesday when Judge
Michael V. Tepedino handed down
his decision.

Judge Tepedino, after a week
of deliberation, found James
Whitney guilty of disorderly con-
duct and fined him $50.

James Whitney, along with
nine other defendants, was ar-
rested for disorderly conduct in
connection with the Dow demon.
stration of February 21.

The trial began on Monday
March 18 and continued into Tues-
day. At that time the magistrate
reserved the right of decision
until Wednesday of this week.

The attorney for Whitney and
the other defendants is Jonathan
Harvey, a local attorney.

Representing the people of the
State of New York is the Albany
County District Attorney, Wil-
liam Gray.

This case began a chain of
cases that will be presented be-
fore the magistrate of the court
in the coming weeks.

Harvey moved for an adjourn-
ment of the nine other cases. He
told the judge that his schedule
was tied up for several weeks.

He was granted an adjourn-
ment for a period of two weeks.
