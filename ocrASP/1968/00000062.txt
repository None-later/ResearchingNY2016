I .To Impose Fine
For Giving‘PilI

(CPS) Under an Administration

proposal now being considered '

by Congress, a student who gives
his roommate a pep pill to stay
awake during finals will be a fed-
eral criminal subject to 10 years
in prison and a $15,000 fine.

The bill makes possession of
“hallucinogenic drugs (including
LSD) and other depressant and
stimulant drugs" a misdemean-
or and “illegal manufacture and
traffic" and “possession for
sale" of such drugs, a felony.

The bill is almost certain to
be passed in the House.

it may face slightly rougher
going in the Senate. At a series
of hearings this week, members
of the Senate Juvenile Delinquen-
cy Subcommittee appeared sym-
pathetic to arguments that laws
for possessionofdrugs, especial-
ly marijuana, are unenforceable
and that the penalties ought to
be lessened or completely elim-
IMEOda

At one point, Senator Thomas
Dodd (D-Conn.), chairman of the
subcommittee said, "i have al-
ways had doubts" about the sev-
erity of marijuana laws, which
are much tougher than these pro-
posed for LSD, even though LSD
is generally acknowledged to bee
much more dangerous drug.

And Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
(D-Mass.) questioned how effec-
tive the government's "educa-
tion program" on drugs could be
when the laws on marijuana and
LSD are so inequitable.

Thus, it is possible that sever-
al senators, including both Ken-
nedy brothers and possibly even
Dodd, who is generally regarded
as a conservative will speak out
against the severity of the laws
against possession of marijuana
and LSD, however, few members
of Congress are likely to vote
for lower drug penalties in an
election year.

At the hearings of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee in
early March, Dean Rusk said:
"We know that China has a popu-
lation of 700 million, armed with
nuclear weapons. We don’t know
China's attitude."

if a student wants to under-
stand the Chinese Communists he
might begin with learning their
language. Sun Tzu, the ancient
philosopher of war, said "To
know yourself and to know your
enemy, you will win a hundred
wars."

The University offers Chinese
language course: beginning atthe
elementary level CH 101, follow-
ed by three higher year levels
CH 201, 300 and 301.

Next semester (fall ‘08) a

New Group Interested
In Racial Situation

Presently a group of students
interested in the area of civil
rights is in the process of or-
ganizing at the University. The
first meeting, held last Week,
drew approximately twanty-five
students and four faculty mem-
bers, with a much greater at.
tendsnce anticipated at today's
meeting.

The basic purpose of this or-
ganization is to make more people
aware of the racial situations,
and change the student's general
attitude of disinterest to one of
interest.

it is not merely an attempt to
educate the students concerning
racial issues and situations, but
to create a group interested in
assembling to talk and work on

guages, and William Woo, Pro-

Stud. Loan Action,

Washington (CPS) - Two Con-
gressional subcommittees, now
considering extensions and re-
visions of federal higher educa-
tion legislation, face a major
muddle over the multi-faceted
student aid program.

The biggest questions involve
the guaranteed student loan pro-
gram, under which the Federal
Government agrees to repay
loans if students default on them
and subsidizes student interest
payments.

Rep. Wright Patman(D«Tex.),
chairman of the House Banking
and Currency Committee, has
accused bankers of trying to
make money off the loan pro-
gram. The bsnkers say they are
losing money.

The Center of the controversy
is a Johnson Administration pro-
posal to pay banks $35 for each
loan made to students under the
program. The banks say such a
fee is necessary to entice banks
to make student loans.

But Patman told the House
Special Subcommittee on Educa-
tion that banks already make
money at the six per centinterest
rate allowed under the program,
He cited a “Bank Stock Quarter-
ly" survey which showed that
banks break even on loans made
at 3.89 per cent interest. He
also said that the General Ac-
counting Office, which provides
financisi data for Congress, had
questioned American Bankers
Association (ABA) figures de-
monstrating how banks lose
money on the program.

Despite the support of most
witnesses of the $35 fee, Rep.
Hugh Carey (D-N.Y.) said the fee
proposal "just isn't selling" in
the House subcommittee, which
began executive session con-
sideration of the bill this week.
The Senate subcommittee has just
begun hearings.

This year's tightbudgetcaused
Sen. Jacob Javlts (ft-N. Y.) to ask

the Office of Education ataSenate
Education Subcommittee hearing
for ideas on ways to“ maximize"
the guaranteed loan program
possibly at the expense of such
existing direct loan programs as
the National Defense Education
Act (NDEA) loans.

it seems likely that Congress
will stop subsidizing student in.
terest payments after graduation.
At present the Federal govern-
ment will pay the interest sub.
sidy for 11 years after the sin.
dent graduates.

Allan Purdy, head of anationai
association of student aid coun-
selors has” advocated dropping
the “forgiveness features" ofiho
National Defense Education Act
(NDEA) loans.

DR. BERKELY PEABODY, Professor of Comparative

Literature, spoke recently on the use of computer analysis of

literary texts.

Mead Reverses Position

On Marriage In Two Steps

(REDBOOK) -- Anthropoligist
Margaret Mead, who recently ad-
vocated marriage in two steps,
today declared reaction to her
plan presented a "dilemma" and
that it was "unsatisfactory" at
present, because "young people
are clamoring for anew morality
that will put a seal of approval
on premarital sex.”

"The need is urgent to re-
think our traditional approach to
marriage," Dr. Mead wrote in
the current issue of Redbook,
just released.

Young people "are not asking
for the right to be delinquent;
they are asking that the stigma
of delinquincy be removed 3.1-
together. They have read the
books that tell them sex is good
and necessary for a well-bal-
anced life.

Almost two years ago, Dr.
Mead proposed the development
of No forms of marriage. One,
which she termed "individual,"
involved no children, and its
limited economic responsibl-
lities would be "easy to end."
The other, "Parental," would
be a second step by couples
ready “to undertake the lifetime
obligations" of parenthood.

"it now seems clear to me
that neither elders or young
people want to make a change
to two forms of marriage," she
said. “They want to reserve the
Word 'marriage' for a commit-
ment that they feel is permanent
and final, no matter how often
the actual marriages may fall.”

Young people "don't want to
compromise their future, es-
pecially the future for the boys,
by a gruelling domesticity too
soon. They are increasingly
willing to wait for marriage,
but they no longer understand
why they must wait for sex."

Dr. Meiid’s advice to them:
“You had hotter get legally mar-
ricd."

“it is theI earnest and respon-
sible young people who are re-
qucsting sex irccilum with
a single, chosen lover who pre-
sent the dilemma," she said.

Dr. Mead said she discovered
during discussion withyoung poi»
plc that "in their eyes, marriage
is meaningless wltlioul children.
The ideal of u cherishing rein.
tlonship lictwccu iWo individuals
through marriage does not appeal
to them.

companionship, as they see it—
or, for the religious and conser--
vative, decorous waiting, is ap-
propriate.

"Why get married?” they ask.
Why can’t we simply live together
until we are ready to get mar-
ried? Contraception is reliable;
no unborn baby is beingwronged;
no girl’s honor will be ruined;
no young man, his education un-
finished, will be trapped into mar-
riage.’

“So parents and advisers,
teachers and clergy, are in a
quandry. . .they say one thing
out loud, one thing from the res-
trum and the pulpit; and pri-
vately, they sympathize, condone
and connlve to give particular
young people the happiness they
are demanding,’ " Dr. Mead
wrote in Redbook.

The children are asking sup-
port of new standards. The most
they can get is collusion in the
kind of behavior that is still
branded as immoral and illegal.
They want parental approval;
they want to feel that what they
are doing is right.

“I believe we have to say at
present: If you want the ex-
perience of full time compan-
ionship with someone you love—
and this is what you should want,
for it is the most satisfactory
and fully responsible relation-
ship—you had better get legally
married, use contraceptives re
sponsibily and risk divorce later.
You are risking even more if
you don't," Dr. Moiui wrote in
Redbook.

- College Proficiency Exams
Give Credit, Meet Requirements

College proficiency examina-
tions or.- dpsigncd to make it
possible for individuals to earn
college credit and meet teacher
certification or other job rc-
ijllII'L‘llleillS through study or ex-
pericnce outside of regular roi—
logo courses.

Any person who lhlnks ho is
qualified inin lake the examina-
tions. The testing'dziics are Miiy
23—24, 1968. The application
deadline is April 19.

The New York State College
Proficiency Examination Pro-
gram was established by the state
Education Department in an effort
to open up the educational oppor-
tunities of the statctoindividuais
who had acquired college - level
knowledge in ways other than
through regular classroom at—
tendance.

The State Education Depart-
ment, after much counsel with
college administrators and fac-
ulty, was convinced of the need
for and assured of much support
from the academic community
of the state for such a program.

Although the program that
resulted from these earlier delib-
erations is coordinated by the
New York State Education Depart-
ment, the academic standards re-
flected in the examinations are
determined by outstanding facul-
ty members from campuses
across the state.

At present, for example, there
are almost 200 college faculty
members who serve as consul-
tants to the program. These
consultants, working in commit-
tees, draw up examination speci-
fications, write examination
questions, rate candidates' an—
swers to those questions, and,
most important, determine lev-
els of performance on the exam-
inations needed to achieve satis-
factory (or better) CPE grades

The State Education Depart-
ment looked to the colleges and
universities of New York
State for guidance in developing
College Proficiency Examination
Program because it would be
those very colleges and univer-
sities which would be granting
credit to the person who did well
on the CPE,

The State Education Depart-
ment itself does not granicoilrse
credit. This is left to the indi-
vidual higher institution to do,
or not to do, in a manner most
consistent with its particular
sinndards.

Extension of the credit - hy-
exuminniion concept is the util-
ization of College Proficiency
Examinations in the teacher cer-
tificnilon process in New York
State.

An individual applying to the
State Education Department for
certification may present satis-
factory performance on a Col-
lege Proficiency Examination in
lieu of specific course require-
ments which may be lacking in
his educational background.

ColumbiaSiudents
War Protest Day

NEW YORK (CPS) -— Students
at Columbia University held a
moratorium on classes Wednes«
day as a way of expressing their
opposition to the Vietnam war and
the draft.

As part of the day of protest,
speeches and discussions on is-
sues connected with the war were
held. Some of the students put
on an art exhibition, while others
held a poetry reading. About
2,000 heard Dwight MacDonald,
well-known writer and an active
supporter of The Resistance, give
his views on the war.

in the evening Alan Ginzberg
gave a reading of his poetry
at the school.

The moratorim grew out of a.
meeting held by the senior class
shortly after the new draft re-
gulations were announced. Sev-
eral of the seniors felt that the
university students generally
should have some way of ex-
pressing their opposition to the
war, and so a coalition of sen-
iors and activist groups on
campus called for the moral-
torium.

Although the organizers of the
moratorium won the backing of
the administration, not all
classes were called off. Accord-
ing to the Columbia College
dean's office, "a few" classes
were held.
