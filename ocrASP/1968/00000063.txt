University would call any law en.
forcement' agency if illegal ac-
tivities were discovered on cam-
pus. As an example, the Vice-
President explained that if a
“not” party were reported to the
Administration it would be their
"obligation" to call law enforc-
era.

Maintaining that an excellent
relationship exists between the
University and both local author-
ities and the narcotics control
bureau, Thorns stated that he had
been assured by the New York
State Bureau of Narcotics Con-
trol that no undercover agents
will be placed on this campus.

In the entire history of the
University, Thorne stated that
only seven students have been
arrested on a narcotic charge.
All of these arrests were made
by Albany Police and were off-
campus.

Five out of the seven appeared
before the Grand Jury. Two out of
the other three have not been in-
dicted. No action has been taken
on the other two individuals. As
yet the University has never tak-
en additional disciplinary action
such as suspension against any
student charged with possession
or sale of a narcotic.

Thorne also explained the
issue of discipline by the
University itself in regard
to those students using
marijuana orotherhallucino-
gens on campus. He stressed
that the University will "not on-
ter a student's room without his
knowledge or presence unless a
specific emergency is present——
e.g. smoke, steam, ﬂames,
screams, etc.”

If University authorities do en-
ter the room it will be the stu-
dent who opens drawers, closets
or other objects in the room.
However, this does not bar law
enforcers from entering any stu-
dent’s room with a search war-
rant.

The University will also pro-
vide legal counseling for a stu-
dent if he so desires. The legal
counseling service is provided
in order to diagnose the problem
and aid the student in deciding
whether or not he needs an at-
torney.

However, the University does
not provide a lawyer for any stu-
dent.

Law,

Association discussed the
double i eapardy.Double jeopardy
is the action of being on trial
twice for the same criminal act.
A student arrested by State Nar-
cotics agents cannot plead dou.
ble jeopardy if the University
decides to take disciplinary ac-
tion in addition to disciplinary
action taken by the Narcotics C on-
trol Bureau.

Stein explained that double jeo-
pardy is an issue between state
and federal law.

Stein also indicated that the
University must cooperate with
law enforcement agencies and
avoid the breakdown of commun.
ications tint occurred at Stony
Brook.

One of the most difficult areas
of this entire problem is the
relationship between legal and
medical regulations.

Dr. Janet Hood, Director
of Student Health Service,
explained the situation that
exists among the student re-
questing medicol and psy-
chiatric help, the Health
Service and low enforcers.

The following is a statement
released by Dr. Hood explaining
this relationship: ,

"In the sincere belief that stu-
dents need to know all they can
about the medical aspects of drug
abuse and also the laws in rela-
tion to drug abuse, it is impor-
tant for students on this campus
to know that although marijuana
is a "narcotic" legally more
than pharmacologically, the law
states that a physician must re-
port the case to the State De-
partment of Health when it ap-
pears that an individual "is an
habitual user of any narcotic
drug.”

"Thus, by law, “habitual” use
of marijuana must be reported.
The physician‘s interpreta-
tion a/ what constitutes
"habitual use" is crucial,
there/arc.

“Medical experience in gen-
eral has shown that the vast ma.
jority of student-users of mari-
juana seeking medical help are
not classifiable as l‘habitual us-
ers" and are, therefore, not re.
portable.

“In our own Student Health
Service on this campus, we have
never fund it necessary to re-
- rt a case.

CHICAGO, March 26 —-

Spokesman for a loose coalition
:of New Left and antiwar groups
said today demonstrators at the
Democratic national convention
here in August would be peace-
ful rather than disruptive.

But they attacked Mayor Rich-
ard J. Daley, charging him with
planning unconstitutional re-
pression, and promised a. legal
challenge to insure their right
to freedom of speech-and as-
sembly.

Spokesman at a news confer-
ence at the YMCA Hotel fresh
from a plaruling meeting held
over the weekend, were Rennie
Davis of Chicago, director of the
Center for Radical research;
David Dellinger of New York,
editor of Liberation magazine,

“If, in the future, we find a
need to report "habitual use,”
the individual will be reassured
that he is not going to be dis-
ciplined since the Student Health
Service under no circumstances
serves a disciplinary function.
Furthermore, the mere reported
act of smoking marijuana is not
a crime under the civil law. When
a reported habitual user of mari-
juana is subsequently contacted,
if he is, by Shte Health Narco-
tics Control or State Police, it
is not for the purpose of punish-
ing the user but for the purpose
of trying to persuade the user to
disclose his source of supply.

“The authorities are primar-
ily interested in source of sup.
ply. Our objectives would be
exactly the same as they would
be for any other health problem,
physical or emotional; namely,
to see that the patient received
the care he came in seeking;
and second, to assist him in
every possible way to continue

and Donald Duncan of San Fran-
cisco, military editor of Ram-
ts magazine.

“I don't think much would be
gained by trying to storm the
convention against all the tanks
and other military equipment they
would bring in," said Mr. Del-
llnger, a principal organizer of
massive demonstrations in New
York City last April 15 and at
the Pentagon last Oct. 21.

Demonstrators may be aimed
at induction centers rather than
the convention, he said. He said
they Would take place simultan-
eously in other cities as wen
as Chicago.

Mr. Davis condemmed the re-
cent arming ofall Chicago police-
men with chemical Mace, adie-
abeling spray. He said the "major
disrupter” of the convention
could be Mayor Daley for such
“provocative actions.”

He said the Mayor had “in-

Medicine. On Drugs

his education if and when he is
ready to do so.

"In other words, students on
this campus who are wise enough
to want to discuss a drug problem
sh0uld feel secure in talking to a
campus physician.

"Student Health Service rec-
ords are confidential and the
psychiatric portion of the record
is filed separately from the regu-
lar record as an added precau-
tion to protect confidentiality.

“The reporting of any health
problem involving follow-ups by
Health Authorities would never
be done without the full knowledge
of the patient himself. And, fin-
ally, no information from our
health records can be sent on
to employers or graduate schools
without the written consent ofthe
student.

"Pushing or selling, no con-
scientious person will tolerate.
Such students are not likely to

dicsted every intention of lock-
ing up the harassing people bent
on exercise of civil liberties."

The Mayor commented at a
news conference that the rights
of all citizens wouldbe respected
but that “no one, no matter who
they are or who they represent
will be able to take over thé
convention hall or streets of Chi.

case)

The coalition initiated last
weekend will be composed of
such New Left student groups
as students for a Democratic
Society, such antiwar organiza-
tions as Women Strike for Peace,
draft resistance groups and slum
neighborth organizations. Re-
presentatives will meet in June
at an undisclosed site in the
Midwest to plan the convention
protest.

Tire aim stated today was "to
use the Democratic convention
as a national platiorm toheighten
our impact and Visibility and
draw the movement together.”

Demonstrations will seek to
stimulate popular antiwar senti-
ment and build coalition member-
ship.
Mr. Dellinger said the coali-
tion would not try to impose
peaceful demonstration tactics
on other groups demonstrating at
the convention.

ed about war and who are seek-

MYSKANIA Plans"

Leaders Seminar
On Curric.Rep0rt

MYSKANIA '69 has begun its

1 year of activities with‘plans for

[a student leader seminar with the
committee which issued the re-
port on undergraduate education,
"New Patterns in Undergraduate
Education." The meeting is tohe
held on Sunday, April 7 at a
p.m. in the Assembly Hall of the
Campus Center.

The report was previously dis-
cussed ln an open symposium of
Faculty and students last week,
but MYSKANIA felt that the pre-
ponderance of faculty at the meet-
ing did not allow as much student
participation as was needed.

Students have been encouraged
by the administration to take a
hand in both the philosophical and
practical aspects of curriculum
change. MYSKANIA chairman
Mishkin indicated that he felt
such a seminar was an excellent
way to achieve this goal.

Because it was consideredthnt
a seminar atmosphere was best
for the discussion of the report,
invitations were limited to the
Commission Chairmen and any
commission members the chair.
men wished to include, the ASP
co-edltors, representatives from
Pan-Hellenic Council and other
student leaders.

Any other students having any
ideas they wish presented at this
seminar should contact the above
mentioned persons to explain
their positions. In this way, the
greatest possible student partici-
pation can be insured.

Black Student Alliance F armed
To Improve Black- White Relations

by GWEH McLaughlin

The Tri-Citles Black Students’
Alliance (BSA), was formed in
November, 1967 on six campuses
in the Tri-Cities area: the Uni-
versity, R.P.I., Skidmore, Rus-
sell Sage, Hudson Valley and
Union College.

Its aims and purposes are: to
reestablish a black identity and
to make the black student on a
predominantly white college cam-
pus more than just a shadowy
non-entity.

Unfortunately, after spending
just a while on a predominate-
ly white college campus, it is
felt by BSA that the black stu-
dent usnally becomes "white-
washed," loses his identity as a
productive black person and takes
up the Hprotective” cloak of a
"from."

Therefore, an organization
with the BSA’s aims and purpos-
es is felt by each member as
essential for the mental well-
being of the black student.

Similar organizations have
been founded across the country,
in direct proportion to the new
wave of black nationalism that Is
newly manifest in today’s black
college students.

Harvard's Afro-American Stu-
dent Alliance (AASA) was the
forerunner of the now-nationwide
black students' alliances. Dart-
mouth College and Boston Uni-
versity's “Afro-Ame" were
started three and two years ago,
respectively, and now have full
support by the school's admin-
istration and heterogeneous stu.
dent body.

Black students at each school
involved in the Tri-Cities BSA
are currently striving for indi-
vidual official campus student
recognition (e.g., the R.I’.I. BSA
the University's BSA, etc.)

The B.S.A.’s current goals are
aimed for: l) more entertngblack
students (both freshmen and
transfers) to area colleges (the
University's College Opportunity
Program is an encouraging
start.) 2) more black faculty; 3)
more interest on the part of the
area colleges' student bodies on
the 'situation' which exists in to-
day's cities (both north and south)
(e.g. the University was the only
area college with an organiza-
tion even remotely concerned
with ”civil rights", the now de-
funct Freedom Council) and, to
further illustrate the cullurallug
of the University. How many of

 

the student body had even heard
of the Orangeburg massacre be-
fore reading about it in the March
15 ASP?

Patricia Thompson, a member
of the University’s BSA says:
“Black is beautiful. We want to
share it! There is a wealth of
African and Afro-American cul-
ture that has been denied to many
of those attending predominantly
white universities (and here, I
am referring to the white stu-
dents.)" The Trl-Cities B.S.A.
suggests a Black Arts Festival
including: exhibits of African
and Afro-American paintings and
sculptures; two concerts; one of
contemporary "soul" music and
another of African rhythms and
dance; lectures by sensible rad-
ical black leaders (such as Gulian
Bond and Floyd McKissick) and
skits or a play performed by a
black repertory company to fill
this "gap."

However, to accomplish the
planning and financing of such an
event, the University's Block Stu-
dents Alliance must first achieve
recognition by the Student Asso-
ciatlon.

The various branches of the
Tri-Cities B.S.A. have inltlateda
variety of community projects.A
luncheon for prospective black
college students was held at
R.P.I. in February; two members
of B.S.A. led a panel discussion
on black power on Channel 17
on March 4; B.S.A. was repre-
sented at the Northeast Regional
Conference of Afro-American
Student Alliances held at Dart-

Public schools in the nation’s
capital will send an official on
a modern-day "Stanley and Liv-
ingstone" tour of Africa in search
of Peace corps Volunteers to
meet an expected critical short-
age of teachers for the inner city
classrooms in the nation.

Edward Winner, director of
Washington's pioneering Cardozo
project which served as a model
for the National Teachers Corps,
will fly to Africa in April to
- interview interested Peace Corps
Volunteers who are completing
their regular tours of service.

He said he may go on to Korea
and the Philippines, but was going
to Africa first because of the
large number Peace Corps teach-
ers available there. Volunteer
teachers who have served in Latin
America, Asia and the Pacific
.will also be sought.

The District of Columbia
schools have about 1,000 of their
7,000 teacher positions still un-
filled for the next fall. Approxi-
mately 3. 500 Volunteers teaching
in the 57 nations served by the
Peace Corps will finish their two-
year tours of service this spring
and summer. About onethird of

- them are in Africa.

D.C. School Supt. William Man-
ning, in announcing the unprece-
dented overseas mission said
"most of our openings for next
fall are in the inner city schools
where former Peace Corps Vol-
unteers have been so success-
ful."

More than 100 returned Peace
Corps Volunteers have taught in
Washington’s Cardozo project.

Manning said he hopes to hire
at least 300 returning Volunteers
for next fall. “We want allwe can
get," he said.

Peace Corps Director Jack
Vaughn said his agency will help
expedite the mechanics of
application.

"We know a great many of our
Volunteers still want to be where
the action is," Vaughn said.
"The interest here in the na-
tion's capital reﬂects the growing
demand for returning Peace
Corps Volunteers in schools
thronghout the nation."

Last year, Philadelphia's pub-

- l

lic schools hired 175 returned
Volunteers sight unseen to help
meet classroom needs in its inner
city. I,

New York State grants immedi
ate probationary teacher certifi-
cation to returned Volunteer
teachers. California also grants

credit for Peace Corps teaching ’

experience.

Manning said the D.C. schools
will credit Peace Corps teaching
as the student teaching require-
ment for probationary certificap
tion.
These accepted will be hired
at the threeyear teacher level.
The current salary at this level
is $6,370. If a proposed salary
increase is approved by Con-
gress, the salary at this level
will be $7,560.

Winner said he will also seek

Volunteers who have no teaching '

experience for the expanded Car-
dozo project which now has about
30 intern program leading to
teacher certification.

Mayor Walker wdsningfon
said, “The Peace Corps Volun-
teers in the Cardozo project have
done such a remarkable joblnthe
past five years that we are looking
for them to make a vigorous and
significant contribution to our
whole school system."
