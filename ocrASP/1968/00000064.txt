SCREW IN in

     

 

 

in recent months, with start-
ling regularity vandalism and theft
have occurred on the University
campus. While some of this, and
even a large part, may perhaps
be the destructive work of out-
siders to the University Com-
munity, we find it impossible to
believe that some of it is not
done by University students.

It is reported that the thefts
reached a high point in December
and January, with the most vandal-
ism occurring in the last few
weeks. On the latter issue, we

wonder if there might be a cor-
relation with certain campus acti-
vities. if there is, those involved
in the activity make it clear that
vandalism is neither appropriate
nor amusing.

Some rather amazing occur-
rences in both categories have
come to light. Stereo parts have
been dismantled and stolen from
the Campus Center along with
numerous art works. The pulley
ropes (halyards) have been cut on
the pole ﬂying the American flag;
the cost for repair in this case
is estimated at $250. A student
was caught walking out of the
administration building with two
lobby throw rugs.

in addition, panels in the men’s
and women's rooms all over cam-
pus have been smashed, and re-
portedly some men have found
great amusement in plugging
toilets with paper towels and then
watching them overﬂow.

There seem to be only two pos-
sible solutions to the present de-
spicable situation. The first, the
retention of a massive police
force, which is neither feasible
nor desirable. The second and
more plausible solution would
place responsibility on‘every stu-
dent to refrain from such activity
himself and to make it clear to
his friends that destroying pro-
perty is not the most useful thing
to do.

The university buildings are
finding it difficult enough to stand
the normal wear and tear of a stu-
dent body 9000 strong, and the
administration and Student Asso-

Give An Inch...

ciation are both attempting to pro-
vide as much equipment as pos-
sible for the use of students here.
If theft and damage remain at
this peak, so much money will
have to be spent in repair and re-
placement that new equipment and
services can not be instituted.

   

Minority

Exposure to various minority
groups and their problems, in addi-
tion to the integration of these
groups in the white, middle class
society is a necessary part of
education. In this University at-
mosphere one important minority
is not exposed— the Negro.

When the student, after four
years returns to his community,
he will not have any greater know-
ledge of the Negro's problems,
and, for those who live in com-
munities where few, if any Ne-
gros reside, he will be as un-
aware as when he came, ot the
problems facing the white com-
munity in relation to the Negroes.
We feel that this unawareness
must be stopped and reversed.

A new group has formed on
campus, so new that it doesn't
even have a name, whose purpose
it is to educate the white com-
munity as to how they may de-
velop a more integrated relation-
ship with Negroes.

Stink

Every so often our nostrils are
desensitized by the stink of gar-
bage when we enter the stair-
way in front of the Campus Cen-
ter’s information desk. The
stench, which arises from the
basement, is not necessary toadd
to the atmosphere of the plush
Patroon Room on the second
floor.

The smell originates from 8-41
where Food Service grinds up all
garbage from the eating areas
in the center. Certain times 8-41
is not cleaned out; consequently,
12 hours later everyone holds
his nose when he uses the stair-
way. Stop the stink, Food Serv-
ice.

Integration

When a university can boast
of a near perfect union of ideas
on its campus, it is dead. Only
a university community which wit-
nesses the expression of innum-
erable opinions by mouth, print,
film or any other means of com-
munication, can classify itself,

  

Problems such as limited hous-
ing and job opportunities in addi-
tion to raising the educational
achievement level of the Negro
must be dealt with after the real-
ization is brought about that the
white people are the cause of
these problems.

We feel that this group, by let-

ting white students know that it
is their racist behavior and atti-
tudes which prompt a Negro re-
action, will do a great service
to the University and Albany Com-
munities.

The group was motivated by the
Riot Commission Report (which
noted the arming of police with
tanks and various other weapons
in preparation for the long hot
summer), to suggest that a Police
Review Board be established in
Albany.

it was mentioned that, in gen-
eral, police brutality is justified
by the non-intervention of the
whites. By setting up such a re-
view board, the attitude of the
police would not only be checked
but rejected by the white com-
munity.

White people must be made to
recognize that to great degree it
is their role, their action and be-
havior which has caused the “Ne-
gro Revolt" and that it is their
responsibility to recognize this
and educate themselves. The Uni-
versity's role in this project can
be extremely helpful. Courses (for
credit) on Black America, gener-
al ghetto and slum problems, spon-
sored group study programs in the
South End of Albany, and the pro-
motion of a more integrated com-
munity here by admitting more
Negro students would, we feel,
activate a greatly needed com
munity consciousness which has
become the white responsibility.

Welcome Back

Last week, the University was
given a small dosage of adrenalin
(not a narcotic) when "suppres-
sion" was resurrected from [he
pidgeonhole it was placed in last
year. The University should have
more publications of the “sup-
pression,” “L’Humaniste” or
“Objector” type.

For it is these papers that,
because of the small number of
people they must respond to, are
free to specialize in one, polit-
ical or intellectual area; they do
not have to be responsible to the
University Community. There isa
need for more publications of this
type to express other views and
ideas.

if a greater variety of student
supported unofficial pamphlets
could be printed, the intellectual
exchange on the campus would be
spread to the student at large and
would better the intellectual or-
mosphere of the University.

Unfortunately, no other groups
have found it to their advantage '0
print their own “opinion sheets"
and there is little effective or
meaningful communication among
the conﬂicting political, philoso-
phical or social groups on campus.

This newspaper cannot accom-
modate all these views in two page:.
each week nor can it provide lilt-
complete interchange of idea:-
which is needed on a campus ul
this size. If we devote more space
to columns we would be neglecting
a primary function of a university
newspaper, that of reporting news
about the campus.

We are attempting to do our hit
to provide effective and meaning-
ful communication among the vari-
ous factions about campus, but M»
are unable because of the nature at
the newspaper, to provide a com-
plete or lasting forum for every
major view at the university.

Are the "suppressionists," ‘105
humanistes" and "objectors" to
be the only unofficial publica-
tions on campus? We hope not;
we hope more groups will publish
their own periodicals to explicate
their own points of view and Phll'
osophies.

students of the world, stand
up and'take a bowl Your activi.
ties, short of the popularity of
“apple .pie,".have focused the
spotlight upon you; its intensity
shown no promise of subsidingin
the future.

Celebrated by Madison Ave.
nue, lured by politicians, assuag-
ed by educators, condensed by
Reader’s Digest, imitated by Mid-
dle age, emulated by the teeny.
hoppers, analyzed by Newsweek
and advncatcd by the New Repub-
lic, you have surpassed even
Shirley Temple and Margaret
Truman in your wide-eyed, ca.
pricious appeal. You have even
succeeded in having Look maga-
zine feel your pulse for you, as
it proclaims "How Students Feel
About the Draft, Parents, Sex,
Drugs, Violent Protest: Their
views will shock, surprise, and
concern you."

And if that isn't enough, there’s
nothing like a headline in the
New York Times to boost the go:
Howard Students Step Up Univer-
sity Blockade; Buffalo State Shut
Down By War Talk; Warsaw Stu-
dents are Cheered as They Defy
Regime on Sit-In; Crscow Stu.
dents Boycott Classes; Tuskegee
Tension Rises; Polish Students
Defy Ultimatum.

There is no doubt that the col.
lege student has been inflicted
with an extraordinary measure
of power and prestige. No longer
do parents and faculty scoff at
student interest in reform as
merely a phenomenon particular
to restive youth.

Aside from the platitudes
(Don't trust anyone over thirty)
and the flattery, there is the in-
creasing realization that we real-
ly are important: we have plenty
of energy to burn, years of time,
a penchant for constructive acti-
vism, a sense of social justice,
a healthy antipathy towards any
Establishment, and an ability to
adjust to change.

it is therefore understandable
that a recent statement by Chan.
cellor Samuel B. Gould should

prove disconcerting to many on'

this campus. His immortal
words, etched forever in last
Thursday's Times Union, include
the following: "The most vocal
protesters are a small minority
trying to embaraas the institu-
tion." Asked to name the groups
causing unrest on the campuses,
Gould replied: "The Students for
a Democratic Society, along with
“Hippies,” were the most vocal

nit

and disorderly. . . . Grou like
sns would like nothing pigetter
than to disrupt us and interrupt
education. . . . but we're here
to provide educational opportun-
ity, not political activism."

Anyone short of a fascist might
interpret Gould’s statement as a
form of slander. It is unfortun-
ate that such a prominent figure
should misinterpret the actions
of students under his own juris-
diction. Chancellor Gould is do-
ing himself great harm by alien-
ating the students who are moral-
ly committed to their goals, hop-
ing that their fulfillment will en.
courage constructive change.

Gould's statement was made
simultaneously with an address
by Mayor Lindsay at Queens Col-
lege urging students to join the
resistance movements in order

  
 

to end the war. The contrast here
speaks for itself.

Every age thinks its crises the
most urgent; an occasion] touch
of vanity is not unwarranted. The
current movements are not a
question of eccentric hippies,
flower children, or Twiggy-strag-
glers; they are sponsored by
earnest and concerned students.

A speech by Robert Kennedy at
Kansas State University is awel-
come antithesis to Chancellor
Gould's sentiments: “lfour col-
leges and universities do not
breed men who riot and rebel,
who attack life with all the youth.
ful vision and vigor, then there
is something wrong with our col-
leges. The more riots that come

on college campuses, the better
the world for tomorrow."

The Right Way

by Robert Isemon

 

 

The theory of open housing, as
it applies to the question of race
relations is somethingwith which
most Americans agree. However,
many people resent the way the
issue is currently being handled.
Far greater than the fear of“the
Negro next door" is the threat
to individual liberties and rights
posed by the open housing pro-
vision of the loss Civil Rights
Act.

Although the goals of the Son-
ate-passed bills are desirable,
the methods and implications of
the legislation are ominous. The
purpose of the bill is to elimin-
ate discrimination in the sale of
houses, and in the allotment of
loans to individuals for the pur-
pose of buying, building, or re-
pairing a house. Specifically af-
fected by the proposed law would
be real estate brokers, who after
December 1968 would not be al~
lowed to discriminate in selling
homes, regardless of their cli-
ents wishes. Builders of large
housing developments, apartment
house owners and private individ-
uals would also be forbidden to
discriminate.

Although the private home own-
er, acting independently without
a broker would be the least af-
fected, his course of action in
selling his home would still be
highly limited. They would be
prohibited from discriminating
particularly if he advertised in a

discriminatory fashion in news-
papers, signs etc.

Penalties for violation of the
law would be fairly harsh. if a
person thought that he was the
target of discrimination he would
contact the Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development. if infor-
mal discussion between the com—
plaintant and the defendant failed,
the case would be taken to court.
If convicted the defendant would
have to pay court costs, actual
costs, and punitive costs up to
$1000.

If the open-housingprovision of
the bill is passed by the House
in its present form, it will do
more harm than good. Forcing
whites to sell to Negroes will do
nothing to solve the problems of
racism. it forces homeowners to
consider people as groups rather
than as individuals, precisely the
thing that the civil rights move-
ment is working against. Does it
serve the Negro's interest or
help him enter a neighborhood
where he and his family wouldbe
the target of name calling and
hate stares? it is the hostile
white neighborhood against which
the bill will work. If govern-
mentintorventlon is not neces-
sary to secure the home, the
chances are the Negro family will
be happy and socially accepted.
If this was not the case, and the
bill was used to force the sale,

(Pontintu‘rl on Page 1/”

Both conservatives and liber-
als are alike in one way; they

. are both "keepers of the faith."

(Sorry 'bout tilt Adam.) Both
are committed to some historic
arrangement ,of human affairs,
be it the "principles of private
enterprise," or the American
version of the "democratic pro-
cess." From my point of view,
it matters not which faith is ad-
hered to, the point is that both
groups ASSUME certain princi-
ples to be valid, invokingthemaa
both explanation and solution for
current difficulties.

Faced with rebellion at home,
conservatives bemoan the gen-

eral drift away from that "indi- ‘

vidual initiative" exemplified by
capitalists and gunslingers of
old; faced with a sea of Asian
peasants wishing to rid them-
selves of the American Goliath,
liberals cry for more "demo-
cracy." (Ballot boxes and hot
dogs for the Vietnamese.)

Although oversimplified, this
two-choice view of the world is
essentially the difficulty of Amer-
ica today. We cannot, or will not
consider other alternatives. We
have become blinded by our own
history, be it the history ofWash-
ington or of the mortgage pay-
ments on that little shack in the
suburbs. Anything which departs
radically fromr‘our reﬂex con-
cepts is seen as a threat to that
in which we have invested so
much of our faith, and will there-
fore become the subject ofattack
or derision. We are Pavlovian
dogs salivating at outmoded sym-
bols.

And those symbols are out.
moded. What is the spirit of pri-

vate enterprise to a peculiariti-
den peasant on the yokengnelta?
Perhaps Vietnamese entrench-
eura should let up cotton planta-
tions with the aidofwliite slaves?
Wint llirlllI majorities in how
many biracial communities luvs
taken it upon themselves to vote
the black man into full equality?
Could it be that our “great Amer-
ican principles" are only valid
in a place called suburbia, and
then stamped “for whites only?"

Perhapl.

The point of all this is tint
there neither was nor ever will
be a social form that in every.
where and forever valid. lt was
fine to be a capitalist in the days
when America was young; men
of black and red skin let us get
away with treating them like an-
imals then. it is fine to hold elec-
tions when the choice is one of
tactics in an otherwise free so-
ciety. The point is that it is blind
folly to evoke those concepts
when the non-whites are in re-
bellion, and the "free society"
is reduced to Scarsdale. The
point is that it is suicidal, but
then that's what we're engaged

it.

What then are the principles
that we are to invoke? What ban-
ners from our past shall we wave
in the face ofthis troubled world?

View From The Behind

 

 

Evere since the drug raid on
stony Brook there has been much
speculation about such a raid on
S.U.N.Y.A. and the possibility
of undercover agents being sent
onto campus.

Most people, however, do not
know that a raid has already been
attempted on this campus.

Several weeks ago, two agents
from the Federal Narcotics Bu-
reau came onto campus disguised
as students with beards (what
else?)

Acting on a tip, they entered
Stuyvesant Tower pretending to
be looking for a rare record al-
bum entitled “The Parmesean
Polka and other Folk Songs"
by the Egg Plants.

Upon entering the elevator they
got their first clue that they
would find what they were look-
in for. Someone had put up asign
advertising the sale of all
"Plant" albums, but that was
only of secondary interest to
them.

There was another mysterious
sisn inviting all truei'believers"
lo a "thing" in a certain suite
ll Just that time.

They headed for the suite won-
dering about the obviousness of
such an invitation.

he door opned into a very
dark room and a shadowy figure

whispered "Quiet!" Another sha-
dow breathed out of the side of
his mouth, "Keep it down! No
one must hearl”

The agents giggled confidently
as they bumped into a wall of
soda cans.

"What's that?” one said.

"Shh!" they are told. It is
then carefully explained to them
that they have bumped into the
largest number of the greatest
variety of soda cans in the entire
Tower.

The agents glance at each oth-
er, suspir-lous of such a
"straight" boast.0urtwo strang-
ers are now standing in the mid-
dle of the floor withpreparations
going on all around them.

One agent asked the other if
he didn't think he saw the shadow
of a girl. The other reassured
him, however, that it was prob-
ably Just a hippie with long hair
with a "you know how some of
these guys are. . .”

Suddenly the phone rang and
the agents heard a hushed "Did
you get it?"

“Are you sure it's fresh?"

"0K. Hurry up. Everyone is
waiting."

Preparations were speeded up.

The curtains were closed and
there was a frantic search for
new candles.

Someone started softly singing
“Everybody’s gotta get stoned"
and the agents gave each other a
nudge.

Everyone moved into one bed.
room as the one everyone had
been waiting for entered with a
huge box whose contents Were
not disclosed.

The door is shut.

A gronp gathered in the cor-
ner quietly preparing for the rit-
ual.

There was a hush as the soft
glow of the candles beganto light-
en ihe dark room a bit.

The agents were ready when
just then the door burst open
and one student was seen drag-
ging another in.

"Happy Birthday!” everyone
screamed as a huge cake with
beautiful white frosting and mul-
ticolored ﬂowers was produced
from the box with all of the can.

"Make a wish!" "Blow the
candles out!" are the yells in
the background as the agents dos.

before the lights could be turned
on.

Oh well. Maybe on their way
out they stopped off to get their
copy of “The Parmesan Polka
and other Folk Songs" by the
Egg Plants.

 

Review oi ihe New Right Wing

by Roy Bertrand

 

 

For those of you who haven’t
read anything save “North Viet-
nam's Official Unbiased Report
on the War" in the last year or
so, we are approaching our na-
tional elections with celerity.
The race has been narrowed
down, by most authorities on the
subject, to five people: President
Johnson, Senator Eugene McCar-
thy and Senator Robert Kennedy
on the Democratic side, with for-
mer V P Richard Nixon as the
Republican contender, and for-
mer Governor George C. Wal-
lace of Alabama running for the
top post on his newly formed
American Independent Party.

What is our choice amongthese
candidates on domestic policy?
Not much. in fact, only Wallace
deviates from the status quo to
any great extent. Wallace wants
to eradicate the problem of riots
by a superior showing of brute
force. He loathes massive Feder-
al spending, but he advocates
massive state spending.

So actually, the only alterna»
tive Mr. Wallace offers is from
where the allocation of funds ori-
ginates. Big deal. Richard Nixon
is not a proponent of radical
changes in our welfare system
as was Goldwater four years ago.
But there are those who label
Nixon a conservative. He is clear-
ly not.

i find it difficult to visualize
any change in mid-summer urban
sports under Johnson, Kennedy or
McCarthy, unless liberals are
correct in assuming that the ma-
jor reason for riots is our Viet-
nam Policy. Johnson as Chief
Executive has exhibited all the
tendencies of a liberalDemocrat.
I doubt McCarthy or Kennedy
could get any more lavish in the
distribution of public funds.

The other major query is the
American role, if any, in Viet-
nam. A vote for George Wallace
is, supposedly, a vote for unleas-
