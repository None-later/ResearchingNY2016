Rosenberg...’

The level of Mr. Rosenberg’s
column, Off Center, reached a
new low last Friday. lwasshock-
ed; 1 had heard most of these
views last year in the heat of
the June War from my non-Re-
gents high school students (with
the exception of the part about
the biasness of the American
State Department.) One does not
except too much independent slit-
ing of arguments from them but
one does expect more selectivity
and objectivity from a columnist
oi the ASP.

Mr. Rosenberg's article was
a masterpiece oi confusion —
the American public attitude in
the thirties, the pervading State
Department policy and the atroci-
ties oi the Nazis were all whip-
ped up into an argument against
weighing the Arab point of view—
such fear of examination breeds
suspicion. Mr. Rosenberg's ar-
ticle is of the same genre of
Negro extremism that creates
bacth — a race or religion
cannot flail its society with ac-
cusations oi past abuses and guilt
and use these reasons as "carte
blanche" for present actions. I
am not advocating an attitude of
"forget the pest, there's nothing
we can do about it now" but i
am afraid oi the unhealthy emo-
tional response that willbe creat-
ed irom continuous indiscrim-
inate whipping.

I am so sorry that this par-
ticular article was printed; sure-
ly, the israeli-Arab situation de-
serves coverage and related at-
titudes should be examined but
not on a pervsrted "McCarthy"
level, especially in a university

1 wish to raise a question
raised in a recent "New ae-
public" article by the distinguish-
ed American historian Henry
Steele Commager; that Is, does
the university have the obliga-
tion to act as an employment
agency for all governmental, in-
dustrial, and other such organ-

it seems to me that although
the university has the right and
responsibility to make available
all such accommodations as are
of the satin-e of furthering the
educational enterprise, it is in
no way obliged to make facilities
available to these organisations

'whose role is not tint of educa-

tion or whose activities are con-
trary to the role oi the educa-
tional institution. Recruitmentby
such agencies as the C.i.A., the
Army, the Marines and the Dow
Chemical Corporation can in no
way show that they do not stand
for the exact contradiction of all
tint for which the university
stands.
It is imperative tint we recog-
nize tilt for the sake of conven-
ience we should not compromise
our integrity as an educational
institution. organizations, agen-
cies and corporations whose ac-
tivities conflict with the princi-
ples of the educational institu-
tion ought to be encouraged to
rent space in local buildings or
utilize offices which they have
presently in the city oi Albany.
1 must emphasize that the key
word here is "obligation." We
must not perpetuate the myth that
by an "open campus" is meant
that the university has the obliga-
tion to permit anyone to recruit
for any organization under the
sun. We must not confuse the
freedom for the exchange of ideas
with the notion tint this univer-
sity has no responsibility to ex-
ercise discretion in leading its
facilities to agencies who wishto
recruit on this campus.

Chesin Reviews

To The Editor:

In regard to your editorial oi
March 15,1068,"CalltoAction,"
may I clarify for you what I
actually said.

I suggested that the University
had an identity oi its own. In
other words, it is more than the
total oi the individuals who in.
teract within the University Com-
munii .

The University, as an entity,
serves as a forum for open dis-
cussion. in order to do so, it must
remain neutral and involved
neither in a political nor social
sense in the world oi action.

Although the individuals within
the academic community enjoy
the privilege oi moving from the
world oi thought to the world of
action, the University must re-
main open and neutral in order
to serve as a forum. Those who
would attempt to force the Uni-
versity into the realm of action
are indeed jeopardizing the very
function oi the University.

I suggested that the University
is primarily an academicinstitu-
tion. it, therefore, must provide
an environment for the exchange
and consideration of ideas. It
functions primarily in the world
of thought.

The second major point oi my
remarks at the inauguration cere-
monies focused upon the im-
personal environment wlthin the
large University. Since no ques-
tion has been raised concerning
my views, i shall not take this
occasion to elaborate any further.

I hepe these points will clarify
my position and clear up whatl
consider to he a misunderstand-
ing of what I actually said.

To the Editor:

Undocumented mudslinging
does mthlng to discredit the tar-
get; it only dirties the hands of
the pitcher. Last week, Ray Bert-
rand in his column ‘ Review oi
the New mam Wing," referred
to Stokeiy Carmichael and H.
Rap Brown as “hate-filled, com-
mie-loving, harnmer-and-sickle
subversives.”

Certainly, the first charge is

cially accepting the Black Man.
But I fail to see where Mr.
Bertrand has found supporting
evidence for the other. twa

Ownie

He should realize that not
everyone who disagrees with his
views is a Communist. If Mr.
Bertrand candocumenthis views,
1 should like to see his evidence.

In a post script to his column,
Mr. Bertrand said, “Fred Hal-
stead, Socialist Workers Party
candidate for 0.5. President,
looks like a fat capitalist." What
Mr. Bertrand's intention was in
making this judgment is unim-

por .

What is important is that he
used the insulting pharasiology
oi one who cannot intelligently
state his views. While the state-
ment did reveal Mr. Bertrand’s
disapproval of the Socialist re-
verting to capitalistic measures,
it also revealed either an in-
ability or lack oi interest in
presenting intelligent criticism.

If Mr. Bertrand wishes tostate
his views intelligently, by all
means he should do so. But if
he slings mud, one can only
smirk.

High Dive?

To the Editor:

1 wish to express my feelings
about a certain aspect oi our
swimming pool. The pool ls
beautiful and the atmosphere is
great. The diving boards are the
most expensive aluminum boards
with all that canbeofferedby any
good board. There are two one-
meter boards and a three-meter
board.

There's only one problem —
you can't use the “high” board.

If it can't be used by us who
can use it? The diving team rare-
ly does, if at all. What is the
purpose oi such an expensive
board? Display? Why build it if
it can't be used? If there’s a
responsible life guard on duty
there should be no problem.l
know I would like to use it and
others probably would too. if
there is another problem involv-
ed lt has not been told but I
would like to hear it.

F rash Gov’t.

To the editor and theClass of '71:

As former vice-president of
the Class oi '71, I feel it a moral
duty to both myseliand the Fresh-
man class to take pause and re-
flect upon what's happening to our
government. There are two
aspects to which I'd like to look
at: (1) the structure oi the new
government and the manner in
which it assumed control and (2)
the plans for Freshman week-
end.

As members of the Class
oi 1971 we should all be concern-
ed with the workings and activi-
ties oi our Frosh gov't. After
all, that gov't is playing around
with roughly 31,500 of your money
and its actions reﬂect the spirit
oi the class to the outside and
to the other classes, so what
goes on should concern us. In
the elections held earlier this
year the procedure was for the
class to elect a council oi 16
from which came the officers.
Why has this been reversed? Why
have the four elected officers
been given the right to appoint
the rest of the council? Are the
desires oi the class iairly re-
flected in this manner? Idon't
think so. I’m wondering whether
any majority opinion is express-
ed in the make-up oi this coun-
cil. The former council reflect-
ed a wide diversity of ideas,
some good, some bad, but from
this broad spectrum we draw
our actions. This diversity gave
life to the council, made it more
than a body oi yes men. Do we

Since i started writing this

Many people tried to make an
identification between the philo-

my choice of pen names.

I assure all of you that I am
writing this column in good faith,
and that i mean whatl say here.
i do suggest that those oiyou who

explore the use of the initials in

There seems to be a growing
amount of impersonality on this
campus, much to the detriment
of most of the student body. Re
cently, l have seen in approach
its logical extension; with the
treatment oi an individual as a
thing.

A leterary example of this was
Sabi Abulibdeh's letter on M.J.

physical examples were the
fraternity hell nights, which have
been taking place over the last

capabilities in an all-out effort
for victory.

On what many consider the
brighter side, Mr. Wallace in-
tends to suppress the sedition
oi the "intellectual morons" on
college campuses and their antl-
war antics. Nixon, although he
remains relatively mysterious
as to how, says he will get us
out oi Vietnam. Mr. Nixon has
always been regarded as a hawk.
Kennedy and McCarthy, for all
intents and purposes, stand for
the same thing. if either oi them
rose to (or fell into) the role

a coalition government would
probably be formed in South Viet-

Communist Viet Cong. As forthe

time remains for him to expound
his plans for the future. We must
therefore assume that he propos-

usual are offering candidates for
the Presidency. We at the Uni.

In his letter, under the title
“ Eyes Mock," this gentlemanen-
deavors to point out mistakes in

my column. I would like to use
what was said there to add to
what I have said in the past, as
an example, about poorly organiz-
ed thinking.

In his letter, Herb Greenblatt
takes great license in the repeat-
ed use oi the terms black and
white in reference to people
(presumably races). It seems, he
hasn’t yet developed a sense of
colored blindness which will
allow him to consider people as
equals, instead of objects to be
distinguished from each other by
color.

It seems very strange that he
should write with suchskillabout
this very problem, while exhibit-
ing so clearly the very symptoms
that he is writing about.

At the same time that IfeelI
must criticize his effort, I also
congratulate him on a good idea
—worklng to dispell me idea that
the various races of Man be con-
sidered Separately. All that is
needed is more intelligent con-
sideration to temper any of the
obvious extremist viewpoints

which could emerge from such
ideas.

what we students would like our

"If Iwere Mr. Gennett,lwould
not have embarrassed those near

The Fenm'

 

It’s All GreekhTo‘ Me...

by Maggie Diets

 

 

In a university constantly eval-
uating‘iraditional ideals and aug-
menting these bases-with new
iunctiona‘l concepts, the recent
report on “New Patterns of Um
dergraduate Education" should
be of greatest interest. In lieu
of the “pejorative images" des-
cribed by the Committee, I have
Suggested "The Forum."

The Committee's emphasis
that the focus of faculty - student
relationships should be concern-
ed with “intellectualprocesses,"
rather than the fare of an "in-
tellectual cafeteria," is a need-
ed definition of perspective. "In-
tellectuai processes" implies an
active state of learning, exposi-
tory and expandable.

Commensurate with the themes
of “inquiry, creativity, rele-
vance, and involvement,” is the
further development of interdis-
ciplinary studies. Departmentali-
zation has its merits in highly
specialized technical study. A
university, however, in provid-
ing an educational continuum for
its members. should take great
care in its stipulated definitions.
If we are trying to avoid pejor-
ative images, and if the student
is to have some choice in his

specialized fields of study, aca-
demic definition must be care-
fully chosen. The pejorative lab-
el of "The Pecking Order" is
supposed to be a thing of the
past.

The Committee's rejection of
the "residential college concept"
for upperclassmen seems quite
valid; excellent reasons are stat-
ed. Historical examples may also
be alluded to: the day of the self-
sufficient feudal manor and oithe
isolationist policy has,hopefully,
chrystallized for the purpose of
academic study and considera-
tion, rather than contemporary
education.

Among the Guiding Principles
discussed in the report, note is
made of the fact that, "the two
main sources of financial sup-
port for higher education are gov-
ernment and industry.” These
sources, of course, reflect our
national, traditional heritage,de-
mocracy and capitalism, which
we have been taught to believe,
constitute the best of civilized
systems man has yet devised.We
should note, however, that a
three-way process is involved;
government, industry, and educa-
tion are all influential and essen-
tial to each others’ existence.
Paradox is found in the idea that
our growing independence we’re
becoming more interdependent.

Concert, with the shortage of

Professors is coupled in the re-
port with the principles oi "sep-
aration of Evaluation from In-
struction." First attention here
should be given the Professor.
Whether he will be teaching’inan
interdisciplinary area, or in a
specialized Departmental field,
two conditions mayariseifpoints
four and five of this section(Pro-
fessor does not grade student)
become reality.

First, the Professor will be
freed from the tedious demands
of a prescribed syllabus.Second,
however, he will have the respon-
sibility of spending time outside
of class with a student who may
ask for help because he has dif-
ficulty reiating the principles
of an interdisciplinary study, or
because he has reached an im-
passe in an independent study
project.

The ultimate result of "Separ-
ation of Evaluation from Instruc-
tion" would probably have no
perceptible change for the stu-
dent. Some arbitrary standard
for judging his work must be
drawn.

"De-emphasis of courses and
course credits" seem to be the
most vital issue here. Arbitrary
systems must be established at
times, as in evaluating a student’s
work, but perhaps an intellec-
tual community can formulate
some limits for arbitration. As-
signment of a specific number of
credit hours to a particular
course would seem educationally
self-defeating. Who can really say
what a course is "worth" —— in
general? in particular? Now,
really? Carrying higher educa-
tion to this kind of an arbitrary
level can make it quite a busi-
ness deal, on CREDIT, no less!

The Gregorian Calendar still
seems acceptable in 1908. Divi-
sion of the present ten-month
duration of two semesters into
three parts might well prove a
classically unifying factor.

In considering new systems of
attaining a goal, most of us have
been taught to select the best
points from each of the new pos-
sible methods, and to correlate
them with what is and has proven
useful. We then may attain the
goal in a more facile, interest-
ing and useful manner.

The three-year Master’s De-
gree program, as an option par.
oils] to the two-year, upper-divi-
sion Bachelor's Degree program,
is a much-needed addition. The
number of students transferring
to this university from two-year
Junior and Community Colleges
is fast increasing. The merits
of an incorporated Master’s De.
gree program have already be-

come manifest at other colleges
and universities. A major ad-
vantage at this university(praise
politics — for a change) is tint
we do not arbitrarily have to ac-
cept such a program.

The concept of the General
College, as stipulated in the re-
port, would depend in large part
upon the teachers and adminis-
trators who are a part of it."i'he
idea of stressing the "more gen-
eral human and personal aspira-
tions of the student" is of not-
able worth, because the General
College would exist for students
in their first two years of higher
education. i would, however,
question two things: 1. How well
would the General College pre-
pare the student for the demands
of upper-division study and 2.
To what extent would the possi-
ble variance of approach between
the General College and the De-
partmental System aid the stu-
dent in making choices in his fu.
ture field of study?

The Departmental Program
could provide a student with a
wealth of opportunity in a parti-

cular field. The conceivable re- '

suits of the Departmental Pro-
gram, however, would seem at
odds with the purposes oithe uni-
versity. Which is more impor-
tant, a department of study, or
the higher education of a student
who must live, work, and com-
municate in tomorrow's world?

Independent Study has already
been begun, although mainly at
the Honors Level. As elucidated
in the report, independent study
is "both a philosophy anda meth-
od, and above all, a spirit or at-
mosphere in which this process
(the educational process) can de-
velop.” Independent Study would
seem to be the New Pattern of
greatest worth. Two words to the
student who now complains about
going to lecture classes, YOU

'T

In a world where our national
prestige, influence, and security
are dependent upon international
factors, the personal and public
need for an international bacca-
laureate are unquestionable.

The Experimental College may
sound, at present, like an experi-
mental idea. In itseli, it is the
greatest innovation of the New
Patterns presented. it may well
be difficult to conceptualize now,
but perhaps we should consider
the changes that have taken place
here in ten years. i would say
that in ten years, it will be very
interesting to see the progress
being made by the Experimental
College.

The Forum is a place of ex-
change, the ever-increasing,
ever-learning value of life.
