Intermedia ’68 Revives
After Poor Beginning

by Robert B. Cutfy

lNTERMEDIA '68 began disas-
trousiy. We’re quite pleased to
announce that some of the artists
involved in this mixed media ser-
ies have attempted to enact the
roles of professionals in their
performances.

Musician Terry Riley appeared
in concert in the Art Gallery on
Tuesday of last week. Though he
calls himself a composer, Riley
cannot be graced with this title
for he has not yet developed eith-
er the talent or the maturity to
write "music."

All that Riley played were the
same sequences of notes in rig-
idly patterned melodies, chang-
ing only the keys. These were
played ove'r and over again, first
on an instrument that he called
(incorrectly, I believe) a saxo-
phone, then on a vox organ, then
back to the other instrument for
his conclusion.

What was interesting about Ril-
ey's concert were the technical
innovations that he brought to the
playing of music. For his "saxo-
phone" numbers, Riley hadatape
recorder playing that recorded
his “music" as he played it.

Wilson Exhibit

An exhibition oi seventeen
new works by artist William ii.
Wilson will be shown in the Art
Gallery oi the University begin-
ning April 1. On exhibit will be
sixteen oil paintings and a leather

the theme of “Women.”

Wilson, an Associate Profess-
or of Art at the University. was
educated at William and Mary
College and the Cranbrook Acad-
emy of Art in Bloomfield Hills,
Michigan, from which he receiv-
ed his M.A.

He has exhibited in ten one-
man shows, including one in
Mexico City, and his recent one.
last year at the University. lie
has won numerous prizes In re-
gional shows. including a $500
purchase prize last year at the
Berkshire Museum in Pittsfieid,
and his works are part of the
collections of the Schenectady
Museum, the Albany institute oi
History and Art. and Berkshire
Community College.

form in the west end of
the coleteria. The times
lor the shows will be

The tape on this recorder was
fed into a second recorder that
played his Oriental-sounding mel-
odies just a few seconds after
he had played them. As he would
be at this time playing a dif-
ferent note-sequence of the mel-
ody, the effect was to create a
surprisingly pleasant range oi
dissonant harmonies.

For his organ playing, Riley
did pretty much the same thing:
sequences in the upper hand were
played against sequences in the
IowEr. This playing oi treble
against base, using the vibra-
ting chord keys of the organ,
produced a powerful beat that vir-
tually hypnotized the audience.

The best of all the INTERME-
DlA artists were those compris-
ing the Judson Church Group,
whose talents were displayed the
night following Riley’s concert,
and, like his, this performance
was staged in the Art Gallery.

Choreographer - dancer Remy
Charlip was responsible totally
for all staging and choreography,
and danced during several num.
bers. His work canbesummed up
as thoroughly professional and
sonsationaliy well-executed: his
dancing was very dramatic, ex-
pressing perfectly every human
emotion, mood, and action.

Composer of most of the music
was the Reverend Al Carmines
of the Judson Church in Green-
wich Village. His tunes were set
to several fairly cynical poems
and were properly simple and
ironic. His singing and piano-
playing added most effectively
to those moods of restrained sar-
casm.

Professional dancer Aileen
Passloff performed with Charlip
in all of the numbers in which
he appeared but two (one being
an awful solo in which Charin

demonstrated his inability to
sing). Her movements were
graceful and eloquent, except for
one number.

In this particular piece (set
to two well-known tunesby Tchai-
kovsky), Miss Passloff perform-
ed in solo, and this proved to
be a mistake. For, Charlip's
choreography was much too vig-
orous and masculine for Miss
Passioff alone: it would have
been better had Charlip danced
this number himself.

Others in the company mustbe
congratulated: Lee Guilllat, for
her lovely, subtly dramatic sing-
ing; George Montgomery, for his
amusing, laconic comments on
the absurdity of modern man (his
actions, institutions, and lan-
guage), war, and, even, poetry,
itself; and John Patrick Dodd,for
his imaginative, beautiful light-
ing arrangements.

The performance was not a
complete success: Andrew Rom-
an’s tenor voiceprovedtobe very
disquieting, while the pallid and
toneless singing and poetry-read-
ing of Burton Supree definitely
constituted the worst moments of
the whole evening.

if additional praise was to be
heaped upon the company, the
bulk of it should certainly go to
Charlip, for the quality of his
dancing, staging, and choreo-
graphy could never be praised
enough. Carmines is certainly
due additional mention for his
beautifully inspired tune for "one
poem from "The Song of Solo-
men."

1 have only one general com-
plaint to make regarding theJud-
son Church Group: their perfor-
mance was too short. Certainly,
a group blessed with such pro-
fessional talent could have putto-
gather a longer show.

 

American poet Robert Wallace will read selections train his
worlu on Tuesday evening, April 2, in the Campus Center

Tops Concert
Tonight In
Gym ‘

The Four Tops, 9. group with
a tremendous knack for record-
ing million sellers, will per-
form in concert tonight as part
of Sophomore-Junior Weekend.
The performance will be in the
new gymnasium, and tickets are
still on sale in the Campus Cen-
ter. Tickets are $2.00 with stu-
dent tax cards and $4.00 without

tax.

The group is comprised of
Abdul Fakir, levi Stubbs, Ren-
aldo Benson, and Lawrence Pay.
ton. The four members formed
the Tops in 1954 and have re-
mained together ever since.

They sing pop, country and
western, modern jazz, and rock.
Their songs include the chart
breaking “Baby I Need Your
Loving," “Reach out PM Be
There," "Bernadette," "it’s
The Same Old Song," “I Can't
Help Myself," and "Rooms of
Gloom."

Paul Drew relates, on the back
of one of the Tops record albums,
that Beetle member Paul
McCartney mentioned that there
was "a song that really turned
him on.” He sang afew bars of
it, and it was "Baby I Need
Your Loving."

The Four Tops perform with
a certain creativity, vitality, and
ability. Their appearance here
tonight should not be missed.

New Arts Group
To Form Soon

A new arts-special events group
is preparing to organize on cam-
pus. A spokesman for the group
said that an organizational meet-
ing has been set for Monday,
April 1, at 7:30 p.m. in the Hu-
manities Building, room 258.

The first goal of this group is
to produce original motion pic-
tures on campus. These pictures
would be written and directed
by students, with student cine-
matographers, editors, and other
technical personnel.

The second goal of the group
is to present student-directed
plays and-or readings. it is hop—
ed and expected that original
works by students could be among
the dramatic productions of this
group.

it has been sug~
gested that this new organiza-
tion would be an unsuccessful
welding of two entirely different
groups and should be split be-
fore a constitution is written.

Blood. Sweat and Tears

 

Fourth Time Around

by Igor Karoluh

 

 

Last week I sounded off about
where music is headed, and I
think it was exactly what was
needed to clear my head. Music
is happening again and in glori-
ous ways with "Blood, Sweat and
Tears.”

This was the group i wrote
about earlier this year — the
one formed by A1 Kooler and
Steve Katz of the “Blues Pro-
ject.” Well, their first album,
"Child is Father To The Man
(Columbia)," is finally out, and
it is nothing short of fantastic.
It’s all here in full glory with
horns, soul chorus, and string
ensemble.

When Kooper was forming the
group he said he was aiming for
a new “soul” sound, non R and
B soul, and no one knew what
he was talking about. In this a1-
bum, “B, S and T" does just
exactly that — they have soulbut
it goes beyond R and 8. Some
will say it’s jazz and in a way
it Is but not really, if that makes
any sense. Tile record is beyond
description and superlatives. Do
yourself a favor and listen, and
I do mean LISTEN, Don’t let it
get by you.

Len Chandler is a painter of

moods. His songs can soar you
through the skies and then drop
you into a pit of sorrow, love all,
laugh, and enjoy yourself. When
he is not fooling around, he can
be the most personal sort of en-
tertainer. He can be one who
really gets into you and makes
you aware of yourself. Those
who saw him perform last Satur-
day knew it — they were, infact,
part of the Len Chandler magic.

Chandler still takes protest as
his mainstream. As he puts it,
"Protest may be out, but then
it was never in." His by-word is
"don’t be cool," and he really
gets it through to his audience,
and they love it and him.

His music is superb, and his
execution perfect without becom-
ing stereotyped. Of course, his
former music training does help
—he holds a Masters in music
from Columbia and has beenpiay-
ing seriously since nine. Never-
theless, Len Chandler is not a
musician, but an actual person
when he is out on stage. He is
somebody to rap with, not hold
in awe; somebody you can really

Jean-Luc Godard

 

Films

by Dave Barclwell

 

 

To some, a Jean-Luc Godard
film is not esthetlc, but anesthe—
tic. Godard coniounds and con-
fuses us, refusing to be specific
when we want data, then capri-
ciously picking up particles of
detail when we crave an abstrac-
tion. He is not afraid to take un-
disciplined risks; he wants to
see how far cinema can be
stretched. Godard ls exciting
Partly because in his films the
director-audience relationship
is the most precarious in all of
contemporary cinema.

Films like “Masculine Fem-
lnlne" bother a lot of people be-
cause on the one hand, the nar-
rative structure is fragmented,
open-ended, and baffling; on the
other, because some long dia-
logue exchanges are shot with a
fixed camera that obstinater re-
frains from cutting into the scene.
We must realize, i think, that
Godard has simply no interest
In "telling a story.” ills aim is
revelation of character and con-
veyance of a mood. That’s really
what "Masculine Feminine" is
all about: the young people of
now, the mood of now.

The film centers on Paul, a
young man just back from the
“my, and his wooing of Made-
leine, a pop singer. He per-
suades her to go to bed; she be-
comes pregnant; Paul falls from
a balcony (suicide or accident,
it's never made clear); that's it.
And most of these actions take

 

place offscrecn. What, then, is
the fiiln really about? It’s about
Viei Nam, James Bond, Pepsi-
Cola, violence, sensuality, Dy-
lan, admass prose, and loneli-
ness -—— seen in "15 precise Ac-
tions," with Brechilan inter-
spersed titles, bursts of violent
action, and :1 soundtrack that al-
ternately cons and scrapes.

The characters are ambiguous-
1y absurd. The males have their
petty rages, impassioned intel-
Iectuallsm, and Troskyiie brags-
doccio; the girls their pert coli-
furcs and ye-ye sexiness. Godard
obviously likes them, but he's
aware of their frequent silli-
ness, so the presentation is not
free of irony. Paul is “unable to
be alone. . . a prey to boundless
authority 24 hours a day" while
Madeleine is a passive musscult
object, a consumer product. Only
Paul senses that they live In a
world of lies, gratuitous vio-
lence, and loss of feeling. (The
abrupt deaths are unnerving not
because of their suddenness, but
because of the bystanders' im-
pussive reactions.) These are
"the children of Marx and Cola-
Cola."

Cinematically, the film is aus-
tere, with much fine traveling-
work and some available-light
shooting in the Bus Palladium so
evocative you can smell steam-
ing coffee. Moreover, “Muscu-
lfne Feminine" Is mostly free of
Godard's usual gamut of iii-jokes.

 

At the movies, Paul thinks, "What
of the film we all carried in our
hearts. . . the film we all wanted
to make . . . the Iiimweall want-
ed to live. . .” in early Godard
this would be a snickering ref-
erence to his New Wave chums;
but here —— so fully has he es-
tablished this world of pop cul-
ture — it fits just right.

in a film with so much dialogue,
the actors must be good. These
are excellent. (I liked especially
Jean-Pierre Leaud as Paul and
Catherine lsabclie Duport as the
charming Catherine.) They are
best at the pivot-points of the
film, two long conversations he-
tweon two couples. Battle—of-the-
sexes sparring, youthful banali-
ties, unspoken tenderness, sud-
den cl‘uelties, feigned nonchal-
once — they're all here, mascu-
line - feminie - masculine - fem-
Inlne, creating the most accurate
rendition of the way our gener-
ation now acts that ihave seen.

Ultimately, then, "Masculine
Feminine" got to me because
Godard, better than any other di-
rector, has captured precisely
what it is like to be twenty-one
at this instant of civilization.
This may ultimately be the film’s
loss as major art; it may data
very quickly. But for us, now, it
has worth. “Philosopher and
film-maker share a certain
View," he says at one point, "but
time belongs to a whole genera-
tion."

time and it's effect is instantan-
eous. Much the same way as i
found myself getting involved
with the lyrics of "Blood, Sweat
and Tears," so am i now be-
coming invoived with Neil’s
songs.

Fred Nell, although not well
known, is a much respected man
in the music community. His in-
fluence has touched many of our
younger writers and musicians.
He is basically a blues man, but
he has words which transcend
this form (listen to "The Dolph-
ins" to see what i mean). Be-
sides his words there is quite a
lot of good backup music goingon
with some very excellent music-
tans.

The pop calendar reads as
such: Four Tops this weekend
and Jiml Hendrix over in Troy
on April 7. Appearing with Hen-
drix will be John Hammond’s (by
rumor-x) new group, “The Soft
Machine," which has not been re-
ceiving what you’d call rave re-
views from the critics up till
now, which is unfortunate when
someone as good as Hammond is
concerned.
