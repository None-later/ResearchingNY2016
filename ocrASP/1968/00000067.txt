Wis. Continues

Open Campus

Madison, Wis. (CPS) —— By an
overwhelming voice vote the Un-
iversity oi Wisconsin faculty has
decided to continue to allow re-
cruiters —- military and other-
wise — on the campus.

Wisconsin was rocked bya ma-
jor demonstration against Dow
Chemical Company recruiters
last fall. Police were called in to
deal with the demonstrators.

A student-faculty committee
set up after the demonstration
recommended that the university
drop all recruiting. Eight mem-
bers of the committee — three
faculty and five students —voted
in favor of ending all recruiting.

But a minority, four faculty
and two students, voted to keep
recruiting, provided that a stu-
dent - faculty committee would
be set up to avoid violence in
specific cases, even if it meant
having a particular recruiter go
off campus. That minority re-
port was approved by the faculty
this week.

"This Student Health Service
feels tint marijuana is atpresent
the major drug abused on col-
lege campuses. Students are, for-
tunately, rather aware ofthe haz-
ards of "speed" (methedrine),
L.S.D. and other hallucinogens.

"Yet in fact, marijuana, in
its own subtle and insidious fash.

"While many legaland medical
authorities would like to see
some mitigation of penalities for

morphine and marijuana.

2. Depressant drugs (barbit-

3. Stimulant drugs (ampheta-

mines).
4. Hallucinogenics (L.S.D.,

The concern over narcotics on
campus has also been a topic of
several memorandums sent out
from the office of the Chancellor
of the State University of New
York system.

In a memorandum released by
Chancellor Gould, it was stated
that "the regulations on each
campus shall expressly forbid
the illegal use of narcotics and
dangerous drugs on campus, and
the regulations further shall
make clear that the institutions,
through cooperation with approp-
riate health and law enforcement
agencies, will provide no sanc-
tuary for those who violate Shite
and Federal narcotic laws."

in the same memorandum
Chancellor Gould discussed the
issue of the presence of unauth.

The bill also limits, if not de-

to do so. When the government

Baseball Hopes Buoyed
By New Sophs, Juniors

It is a rare occasion when
a college couch does not have
to count upon unseasoned or un-
tried players because of grad-
untlons from the prior year.

Albany baseball coach Burling-
ame is no exception and yet, his
“unseasoned” hopefuls shape
up in his words as “possibly the
strongest squad I've ever had."

Up from the freshman team
of last year are six sophs led
by Jim Sande.

Sande, an outstanding pros-
pect behind the plate, was first-
string catcher for the fall base-
ball team and impressed Bur-
lingame as a sure starter for
this spring. "He could be the
best potential backstop since Dick
Odorlzzi,” commented the coach.
Odorizzi was a three - year
varsity player for Albany who
compiled an overall .372 batting
average for State. "I would even
say that Jim is faster and has

a better arm lhun ()dUl'lIZl,"
added the coach.

Another soph with chances of
seeing much action is second
base prospect 'l‘om Decker. llc
wielded a big but for the fresh-
men last year and can also play
in the outfield.

A soph with a good chance to
tie down the vacant third base
job is Steve Flood. Coach Bur-
lingnme will look to two sophs,
right hander Richie Splers and
lefty Dick Bardeschewski to
back up five returning; leiiermen
1n the pitching corps. Barry
Blake, another soph, is also in
contention for the catching
chores.

Albany will noi rely solely
upon sophomores as there are
three upperclassmen with good
varsity credentials. Junior Tlm
Denman, a catching prospect,
played frosh ball but was hurt
last year.

Linksmen Face Season
With Four Lettermen

by Everett Colman

As the spring finally begins
to make its mark here in Albany,
the State golf team is being or-
ganized for the 1968 season. The
team, guided by Coach Richard
"Doc" Sauers," has aschedule
that includes eight matches and
the important Capital City Tour-
nament.

Twelve men have been Working
with Coach Sauers at the indoor
setup in the Physical Educa.
tion building and will continue
this until practice can be held
outside. Although last year the
team was plagued with no seniors,
this spring the linksmen will have
four returning lettermen on a
seven-man squad. This exper-
ience is indeed the best advan-
tage that the team has.

Four Man Nu cleus

The nucleus of the squad will
therefore consist of four men.
A senior who transferred from
Delhi Tech last year, and an
outstanding golfer is Craig
Luthor, one of the sharpest men
on the course last year. Consis-
tently shooting in the 70’s, Luthor
should be ready for a fine sea-
son.

Brian Hill, a junior, was one
of last year’s starting six, and
also had a good season. He and
Ray McCloat, a senior who will
be stroking with the linksmcn
for the third year, are two men
to be watched.

Finally there is liiil Ponder-
gast, another senior and three-
yeur man. Having two years ex-
perience on the squad, Bill is
looking forward to competition
again this year.

Others trying out are Dave
Broiler who played last year and
Gary 'I‘urtou, 11 inmates from
Hudson Valley.

"The first match will be held
0" April 10, 1968, away at Cen-
tral Connecticut State. There will
also be two other contests dur-
ing the Spring Vacation. l-‘ullow-

ing Spring vacation will be a
match against Oneonta and New
Paltz to be held at the Mac-
Gregor Golf links in Saratoga.

The freshmen squad is also
being organized. Coach Bill
Schicfflin is now working outwith
twelve prospects for the team.

Bad News Takes Two Points

In AMIA League I bowling action this past weekend, Potter Club was finally scored
upon as they gave up two points to the Bad News (5). Bob Keller led the Bad News
(5) with a 579 series. The Shafts, led by A1 Giles with a 572 series and Tony Romano,
who registered a three-game total of 567, stayed on the heels of'Potter as they were
able to capture all seven points in their match.

In gaining five points, Potter was led by Ray McCloat who registered a 555, and by

Tom Piotrowski and Roger
Cudmorc who recorded
identical 546 series.

Al Giles of the Shafts has
been the top bowler through-
out most of the season, and with
help frqu 'l‘ony Romano(aiso in
the top ten) has kept the Shafts
close to Potter. The men of the
club have maintained three stea-
dy bowlers in the top ten through
most of the year. Roger Cud-
nlore, Tom Pictrowskl and Ray
McCloai have bowled consistent-
ly, thus keeping Potter at the
top of the league.

Club to Start Practice

Albany State's newly formed
Sailing Club will make its debut
Saturday April 6 when they will
be competing in the New York
Metropolitan Novice tournament
at Kings Point. The Club which
was organized by Dr. Curtis Hem-
enway and Charles Bowman, pre-
sently consists of approximately
30 members. If these some 18
have had previous sailing exper-
ience, and 8 have actually raced
in competition.

The Mohawk campus will be the
club’s home base, and compe-
titive sailing will probably be
done in the Mohawk river. Equip-
ment consists ior iour teck
dinghles, and seven 120's which
just arrived this Monday. The
club has huLi little actual prac-
tice thus far, but with the arrival
of the 4205 and lhc melting of
the ice at Mohawk, the club
hopes to be able to hold trials

before the first match.

Dr. Hemenway has stated that
the Sailing club will welcome
all newcomers, however, he em-
phasizes that sailing takes con~
slderable know-how. For this rea»
son all Sailing club members,
must pass a swimming profi-
diency test, and a written test
based on the text "Basic sailing,"
which is available at the book-

store.

The Sailing club presently
plans to be involved in three
areas of activity: instructional,
recreational, and intercollegiate
competition. Dr. Hemenway has
emphasized the fact that Sailing
is one sport in which Albany
State can stop right into ivy
League quality competition.

The Sailing club also has
arranged a fall schedule, to coin-
pliment its spring schedule, and
it hopes to be able to schedule
home regattas by next spring.
