As the University’s enrollment grows, it is-fitting

and proper that AMIA should expand and grow propor-
tionally, and this, it is doing. The AMIA basketball
season will finish up this weekend. after a final flour-
ish of activity unprecedented in past years. On Sunday
there were two divisional playoffs, and on Tuesday
the division leaders played off for the championships
in all four leagues. The first round of the Commission-
ers Cup tournament was played Thursday, with the semis
scheduled for this Sunday, and the finals for Monday at
9 p.m. The real culmination of the season, however,
will be the first Capital District extramural tournament
which is scheduled to start Tuesday at RPl.

All in all the AMIA basketball season has to be clas-

sified as a success.

For the first time in history

League I was split into two divisions, as were the
other three leagues, resulting in the largest schedule

ever.

The late opening of the new gym did curtail

schedule, and confine the players to Page for the first
half of the season, but Leagues I & 11 did finish up
their schedules in new and spacious quarters, and the
outlook for next year is quite promising. Amazingly
enough most of the leagues were fairly equal, as few
teams managed undefeated seasons, and few. went win-
less. The officiating was somewhat improved, but some
officials seemed to have a tendency to spectate, rather
than control the game. Perhaps this might be remedied
by instituting a rating system for officials.

The coming softball season will also be certain to re-

ﬂect the increased enrollment,

but there are sev-

eral problems that will have to be overcome. First of
all there are no real softball fields. The present plan
is to play leagues l-lll on grass field at the new cam-

 

Potter Club. teams romped to easy wins Tuesday night in both the League land the
League 11 championship games. Amazingly both of the winning teams had been forced
into play-offs before winning their divisions, but the finals left very little doubt as to the
top team in either league. in League I action Potter combined a hustling, alert defense
with some fine outside shooting to score an easy 44-28 win over APA.

The Club jumped into an early lead and was never headed. With Jim McVea popping

 

as:

from the outside, and
George Webb scoring from
underneath, Potter stead-
ily built its lead, while
APA panicked.

Utilizing a tight man-to-
man to keepA PA away from
the basket Potter built a
21-13 halftime margin, and went
on to outscore APA by the same
margin in the second half. Mc-
Vea had 12 and Webb 10 for
Potter, while Elkin led the way
for APA with 7.

in the League 11 final Potter
shOWed a strong bench, as they
fast broke out of apressing zone,
and dashed to an impressive
23-9 half time lead.

Potter went cold in the sec-
ond half, and KB regrouped its
forces to come on strong at
the end, but Potter's early lead
proved insurmountable, and the
final was Potter 39, KB 30. Pet-
ter’s scoring was extremely well
balanced, as Jim Curley led with
10 and Fred Nelson followed with
9. Bruce Herring led KB with 7.

the Rotors by a 53-24 count.Dave

’68-’69 Food Plans
Offer Two Choices

Preliminary plans for changes
in contract food service next
year have been prepared by Food
Service and the Office of Rest--
dance of the University. The
joint committee considered ro-
commendations made by Cen-
tral Council and the Living Area
Affairs Commission. A survey
by LAAC of student opinion pro-
vided the ground work for the
Council and Commission recom-
mondations.

The new board plans for the
1968-69 academic year include
a "14 meal plan - breakfast,
lunch and dinner, Monday-Thurs-
day, and breakfast and lunch on
Friday; cost- $250 per semest-
er;” and a “20 meal plan -
breakfast, lunch and dinner, Mon-
day-Saturday, and breakfast and
noon meal on Sunday; cost $290
per semester."

The original LAAC survey pro-
posed a M-moal-per-woek plan
allowing students to choose from
breakfasts, lunches, and dinners
up to a total of 14 meals per
Week. A large majority of stu-
dents (yes 1830, no 272) favored
this plan. Because this plan was
deemed infouible by the joint
committee, the idea was dis-
regarded.

A second plan including 20
meals per week on which the
student voted 881 yes and 1158
no, was incorporated.

Meal ticket transforability
from one dining hall to mother
has also been included in the
plan. Not within the scope of this
proposal is a no board option.

Reasons for the deferral ofthe
offering of this optionfor at least
one more year are: lack ofknow-
ledge of the effect of the new
board plans on costs, decision
for no board by students would
be based on consideration of this
year's meal plan, transfer prL
vilege will eliminate much of

pus, with League IV (a freshman league) on the old
campus. Another problem is the Spring recess, which
comes right when the softball season should be start-
ing. This has resulted in pushing the starting date for-
ward to April 3, which in View of the normal Albany
weather, is truly amazing optimism. if we have a rainy
or chilly spring, the softball schedule may be wiped out.

Now that we have the new facilities, the scope of
AMIA activity will be greatly expanded. A new innova-
tion is the AMIA swim meet which will be held this
Monday and Wednesday in the new pool. The annual
track and field day is also being planned for some-
time this spring, while this coming fall will witness a
real expansion. Volleyball is scheduled for the auxiliary
gyms, while squash and handball may also be organ-
ized on a team basis. There is even a possibility of do-

ing something with badminton.

Another sign that the intramural program is expand-
ing is the fact that AMIA officials are now considering
the possibility of dividing their program into fraternity
and independent divisions. All that is needed for this to
become a reality is evidence that there are sufficient
independent teams to handle it.

AMIA Swim Meet Set

AMIA activity will branch out
into a new area on Monday with
the trials of Albany State's first
intramural swim meet. The site
will be Albany's palatial new pool
and the starting time will be6:00
p.m. The finals will then be held
on Wednesday with the same
starting time.

Entries may be made hyteama
or by individuals. However, to-
day is the last day to sign up,
with entry forms available at the
desk in the men's locker room.

The following events are sched-
uled: 50 yd. freestyle, 50 yd.
breaststroke, 50 yd. backstroke,
50 yd. butterfly, 100 yd. individ-

ual medley, 200 yd. medley re-
lay, diving, 100 yd. freestyle
and 200 yd. freestyle.

Models and Trophies

First, second and third place
finishers in all events will re-
ceive medals, and a first place
team trophy will also he award-
ed with a scoring system of sev-
en for first, five for second,
four for third, and 3, 2, and 1
for fourth, fifth and sixth.

The institution of AMIA swim-
ming demonstrates the fact that
AMIA will now be able to expand
tremendously to take full advan-
tage of the new gym.

Extra-Murals at RPI,

Albany Has Two Teams

Extramural competition will
get under way this Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday, as four
Capital District schools will meet
at RPl to vie for intramural
basketball supremacy. The tour-
nament was originally scheduled
for March 14-16 but Union offl-
clals felt that they should finish
their regular schedule before
picking teams for the tournament.

The two teams that will repre-
sent Albany were chosen by the
League 1 captains, and are d1-
vlded by ability into a first and
a second team. The first team,

The Albany State Track Club
will compete in its first meet
on Saturday April 6 at Brandeis
Collage. Coach Munsey feels that
the team is strong in some events,
is improving in others, and can
not yet determine its strength
in still others, as men have not
yet been able to practice certain
events, such as the pole vault.

The team's strongest events
at this point are the half mile,
mile, and the two mile. Leaders
in the 880 are Dick Horowitz,
Joe McAndreWS, ’l‘om Mills
and Paul Roy. In the mile and
two mile Larry Frederick, Don
Myers, Pat Gepfert, George Roll-
ing and Mike Attwell are the
main competitors.

Munsey feels that the sprints
will improve as the weather bo-
comas warmer. Basil Morgan,
Mike Nolan, and Torry Mathias
will be the main competitors

an unanswered question. Royce

Beevers head the list in the java-

are.

Over forty men are still out
for track, and coach Munaey feel
that spirit and moral are high,
and that the team is working hard.
if there is improvement in the
weights and in the hurdles, he
feels that the team will become
strong and will be capable of
winning meets.

Voting will be by paper ballot.
The ballot is so constructed that
first, second, and third choices
will be recorded. The first
choice will be tabulated for
election purposes and the second
and third for statistical analysis.

The Choice '88 Steering Com-
mittee has received campaign
material for all candidates and
will direct this information to
the persons now organizing for
specific candidates. Anyone
wishing to begin a campus effort
for a candidate not yet repre-
sented should contact Barry Rose
for campaign materials.

The Albany student Press in
conjunction with the Choice '68
Steering Committee is planning
an election special edition to be
distributed Monday, April 22.
Plans include comprehensive in-
formatlon on each candidate with
pictures and other appropriate
materials. Any group interested
in placing an advertisement in
the special addition, for a
particular candidate or position
on one of the propositions con-
tact Linda Berdan at 457-2190.
The steering committee has
agreed to limit this advertisingto
12 column inches per candidate
or position.

According to group officials,
the McCarthy and Kennedy
groups on campus are now func-
tioning at close to top form.

Chairman of the McCarthy
group is Sally Mendola, a soph-
omore. Michael Gilbertson, a
freshman, is servingas co-chair-
man.

The McCarthy group is work-

ing with the Albany CDA - Coa-
lition for a Democratic Alterna-
tive — in an attempt to pro~
cure electors for McCarthy at
the Democratic National Conven-
tion. Leon Daims is the
representative of C.D.A. who has
been in closest contact with the
group.
Although they plan a great
deal of work on the coming col-
legiate "presidential preference
poll," Choice '68, the main ob-
jective of the McCarthy work-
ers will be to contact as many
registered Democrats as pos-
sible in the Albany area.

Lyndon B. Johnson announced
to a stunned public that he would
neither seek nor accept the no-

The reactions of students at

the University to Johnson's de- '

cision were varied. Ron Pisanf,
a sophomore, expressedthe doubt

"i still don't believe him. It's
probably some kind of political

Campus Strike To Illustrate
War Dissatisfaction April 25,26

by Ed Silver

in conjunction with a coordin-
ated national and international
effort, the University will be the
setting for a proposed student
strike on Friday April 26. The
purpose of this action is to unite
campus dissatisfaction with the
continuation of the war in Viet-
nam into a single countrywide
show of strength.

in addition to the strike, in-
terested University faculty and

PRESIDENT JOHNSON SURPRISED the notion this week

students have created a two day
teach-in to run Thursday, April

all day Friday beginning at93.m.
The teach-in'wlll include local
faculty members as well as
speakers, poets, writers, and
authorities from around the coun-
try.

About forty University faculty
members have offered to either
support or participate in the
teach-in. other speakers will in-
