With Jr. mgr.
by Kathy Deyee

Sixty university students from
the educational psychologwa
ture class of Dr. sivers and Dr.
Gioia are involved in an experi-,
ment oe the Hawthorne effect.
This experiment hag a dill pur-
pose. it is a study otholnework
of the junior high school student,
but also has an experimental de-
sign permitting a study of the
Hawthorne effect.

Tile Hawthorne effect is based
on research done at the Western
Electric Plant in ChimO. Illi-
nois, in the 1920’s. At this time
the study was purely industrial
research. it involved changes,
for better or worse, in the work-
ing conditions it the employees
involved. The generalization
made from the study is that the
workers were stimulated more by
knowing they were in an experi-
ment then by any of the changes
in the working conditions.

In the field (1 education, such
research has been effective be-
cause the children involved feel
they have been given special at-
tention. They have been stimula
ed more by attitude than by what
is actually being done to them.

Mrs. Sivers, of the Education-
al Psychology Department at the
University, is sponsoring the ex-
periment on the Hawthorne ef-
fect. She is being assisted by Mr.
Gray, Mr. Haas, and Mr. Wil-
liams, all of whom are studying
for their doctorates ineducation-
of psychology.

The six-week study is taking
place at Shenendehowa and Guild-
erland Junior High Schools.
These two schools were chosen
because their six week marking
period coincides well with the
university program.

Three groups of twenty col-
lege students each meet with the
junior high school students once
a week. The college students vol-
unteered to participate in the
program. There are two groups
of elected junior high school
students involved at each respec-
tive junior high. Members of the
two groups have been matched
according to four factors: sex,
grade, 10, and academic achieve-
ment. One group represents a
dyadic relationship between the
junior high and university stu-
dents. These particular junior
high students have weekly con-
tact with the university students.
The second group, the control
group, know they are involved
in an experiment, but they have
no individual contact with the un-
iversity students. It has been hy-
pothesized that the group having
a dyadic relationship will, be-
cause of the individual attention
given to them, achieve higher
academic success than the con-
trol group.

The actual results of the ex-
periment won't be available until
the end of the six week period.

Smiles Baseball Game
Tomorrow; ALC vs. LaSalle

by Aug Deaantis

Smiles has arranged abuse-
beii game between LaSslle and
ALC. Smiles works with children
in the whole Albany area, which
includes LaSalle. The LaSalle
boys are between 12 and 15 years
old, and they come from broken
homes or are in temporary trou-
DIGe

The brothers of ALC decided
to have the baseball game to-
morrow on the field opposite
Brubacher. In case of rain, the
game will be played in the La-
Salle gymnasium. This is the first
time Smiles has cooperated with
a Greek organization on campus.

Johnson: Not Candidate

(Continued [rorn Page 1)
Johnson was aware that "he no
longer had the support of the he.
tion," as Janice Winter, a first
semester freshman, commented.
The prospect of "a more exciting
election" and the beliefs that
Johnson’s decision was "in the
best interests of the nation"
prompted Jill Kaufman, class of
'70. to admit she was "Very
happy" at the decision.

President Johnson, in his ad-
dress, also announced that he
had ordered a halt in the air and
naval bombardment of most of
North Vietnam. He also invited
the Hanoi government to join him
in a “series of mutual moves to-
ward peace."

At the same time, Johnsonurg-
ed the Soviet Union and Britain
to move from his "unilateral act
of deescalation" towardagenulne

peace.

He dse Ambassador at
Large Averell Harrimen and
American Ambassador to Moe-
cow, Llewellyn Thompson, ashls
representatives to be available
in Geneva or any other suitable
place just as soon as H' .l
agreed toaconie'r‘el'ice’.‘ ' ' ‘

But if peace does not come
through negotiations, Mr. John-
son asserted, lt will come when
Hanoi understands that "our
common resolve is unshakabie
and our common strength is in-
vincible."

iai event, ALC is creating, ac-
cording to lrene Petzinger, treas-
urer of Smiles, "a feeling of
good will between the University
and a segment of the community
which is usually unnoticed." Box
lunches will be provided by the
Food Serivce.

The LaSalle boys come from
the Eastern part of the United
States, and LaSaile has a long
waiting list of children trying to
get in. Smiles would like to get
the University interested in work-
ing with them in community so.

In congratulating Dr. Fiser
and the committee on Undergrad-

"New Patterns of Undergraduate
Education," Mishkin said, "We
were greatly impressed with the
thorough and thoughtful treat-
ment given to the suggested new
patterns, and we take pride in the
fact that our University, while
striving to solve the problems of
the present, is, at the sametime,
'prevailing upon the winds of
change.’

“We note the important role
that you feel students should play
in the development of the lpost-

The letter continues to invite
Dr. Fiser along with the Curri-

part in an open discussion of the
report with student leaders April

Kelleher Letter,
Johnson Discussed

by Tim Keeley

At the President's Conference
with Students on Monday, Presi-
dent Evan R. Collins discussed a
several sundry topics including a
letter he received from Assem-
blyman Neil Kelleher and the an-
nouncement of President John-
son's decision not to seek re-
election.

Last week Collins received a
letter from Assemblyman Kalle.

CPC Applications
Now Available

Applications for at - large
memberships on the Community
Programming Commission are
now available at the Information
Desk of the Campus Center and
in the Student Activities Office
(CC 136). The applications are
due April 11 to the Student Ac-
tivities Office.

The CPC is a means of mak-
ing your ideas about program-
ming on this campus known.

If any student is interested
in any aspect of programming
he may apply for the CPC as
either a general at-iarge mem-
ber or for a special area of
the commission.

The commission is involved
in the evaluation,initiation and
promotion of activities in the
areas of special events, social
and political concerns, recre-
ation, and arts - cultural con-
cerns.

Activities of the commission
this year include the establish-
ment of a governing board for
the campus center, the sponsor-
ing of intermedia, and setting
up the coffee house circuit
(through the governing board)
and many other activities in the
field of programming.

Political Groups
Make Plans

(Continued from I’rlgc I)

The charge for the buses will
be 50 cents.

Anyone who is interested in
working for McCarthy should
contact Sally Mendolu at 457-
7899.

The Kennedy group on cam-
pus has also been very active
this week. After their success-
ful organizational meeting, M.J.
Roaenberg, organizer of the
group, has stated that they have
“nearly 400 students who have in-
dicated their willingness to work
for Kennedy."

Plans have been made for the
establishment of a storefront
headquarters somewhere in
downtown Albany.

The Kennedy students are hav-
ing a meeting (at which responsi-
bilities will be assigned) on
Tuesday, April 9. Rosenberg re-
iterated that "any students who
wish to work for Kennedy can
either contact me or attend this

Kelleher is quite disappointed

with me," commented Collins.
This letter was written to C01-
lins in response to his failure to

disclose the names of faculty
members available to students
for draft counseling.

Collins asked the students
present to comment on Johnson's
decision. The general

of these students was tint Ken-

nedy and McCarthy will now be
given greater chances at their
bids for President.

A student at the conference
asked Collins whether James
Whitney will be punished by the
University. Collins felt that " The
proper group to deal with this is
his peers.”

if action is to be taken, the
Faculty Senate is the group that
will decide upon the matter.

Collins also released a report
from Dean Robert Morris of the
University College.

The report compared last sem-
ester's UNl students with those
of a year ago.

it showed that 12.8 per cent of
this year’s freshmen were on the
dean's list as compared to 9.7
per cent last year.

The number of students on
probation also decreased.
"These studies would indicate
that we are enrolling better stu-
dents each year."

For Albany 3

This week marks Kappa Beta
Fraternity’s first annual All-
University Clothing Drive for the
South End. The drive will last
from Wednesday, April 3to Tues.
day April 9.

Boxes for the collection of
clothes will be placed in every
residence lower lounge. Ailresi-
dents, faculty, staff and com-
muters are asked by Paul Lieber-
man, chairman of the drive, to
cmperate since the amount of
participation deter mines the suc«
cess of the drive. All types of
clothing are needed.

Clothing will go to the Trinity
institute in the South End. The
institute has a thrift shop, which
is open every Tuesday. The
clothes will be sold there at a
very nominal charge; various
activities, which are sponsored
by the institute are funded by the
proceeds of the sales.

'Dippikill, Mohawk, Offer

Relaxation, Stimulation

by Edna Gunderson

Camp Dipplkill and the Mo-
hawk Campus will have again
much to offer students by way of
outdoor relaxation and stimula.
tion this spring.

Opportunities for boating, Ole
noeing, badminton, volleyball,
softball, and hiking are all avail-
able 12 ,miles from Albany at the
Mohawk Campus.

These 299 acres of property
(loo of which are owned by the
Faculty-Student Association and
189 of which is leased from the
state) containing areas of forest,
meadow, and lagoon are looked
after by Russell Baker, who is
the Superintendent of Buildings
and Grounds, and a crew of sev-
en students employed under a
work-study program.

These people maintain the
property, repair and build things
and are available to assist groups
who have reserved places on the
Mohawk and Dipplkill properties.

Gary Jones, Assistant Direc»
tor of the Campus Center, re-
marked that without this small
group of workers it would indeed
be difficult to keep these off-
campue areas in operation.

Reservations are required for
the use of the Mohawk Campus.
However, Jones observed that in
the future, if a larger staff of
workers were employed, as is
possible in the summer when
more ‘ " ‘ are “ “ for
employment, “open-hours” may
be established at Mohawk.

That is, there would be cer-
tain hours when the area would
be staffed to serve students with-
out any previous reservations
or preparations being necessary.

Also at Mohawk is the Charette
House, once occupied by the Char
rette family, which dates back to
the 1820’s and contains acolon-
ial furnished room with a fire-
place, a dining area, and a snack
blar which can serve 200-250 peo-
p e.

The Old Barn is not standing
any longer as the result of a fire
last July 16, of which the cause
is still unknown.

This year there are 13 canoes
and 5 boats. One of these may
be rented for 25 cents per hour
or $1.00 per day, but may only
be used in the lagoon and canal
area since there is too much of
a risk for the Universitytobe re-
sponsible for boaters who are out
on the Mohawk River.

Drive Starts
South End

social centers down in the South
End of Albany.

"The purpose of the drive,"
according to Lieberman, "is to
try and make the student aware
of the community's problems and
to hope that he will participate
in other such projects."

Lieberman termed the drive
a 'communlty action type pro-
ject.’ it is his hope that the oth-
er fraternities and sororities
would in turn take the lnitaitve
and perform in these various
projects, giving more meaning
and purpose to the greek organ-
izations and their memberships.

0n the last day of the drive,
the Campus Center Ballroom will
become the central packing point
where the articles will bepacked
for shipment downtown to the in-
stitute.

can be of use to the institute or
wishes further information, he

Abortion Proposal

Reprinted from the New York
Times (March 30)

GoVernor Rockefeller en-
dorsed proposals by his special
committee that would vastly lib-
eralize the state's 85-year-old
abortion law.

The major recommendations
that were endorsed by Mr. Rock-
efeller would permit an abortion
when:

it is necessary to save the life
of the mother.

The continuance of the preg-
nancy would "gravely impair”
the mother's physical or mental
health.

The woman has a permanent
physical or mental condition
which would render her incap-
able of caring for the child, if
born."

There is substantial risk that
the child, if born, would be “so
grossly malformed or would have
such serious physical or mental
abnormalities as to be perman-
ently incapable of caring for him-
self."

The pregnancy resulted from
rape (excluding statutory rape).

The pregnancy began while the
woman was unmarried and under
15 years old and she was still
unmarried when the abortion was
requested. ‘ﬁ
