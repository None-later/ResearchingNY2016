Computer Use In Analysis
Of Literary Texts Discussed

Dr. Berkley Peabody, Profes-
sor of Comparative Literature at
the University, spoke recentlyon
the use of computers in the anal!
ysis of literary texts. His lec-
ture, entitled “The New stylo-
metrics," was part of the lec-
ture series sponsored by the Uni-
versity's Department ofCompar-
ative and World Literature.

Stylometry is the statistical
analysis of texts in terms of
specific sign characteristics.

The new stylometrics differs
from earlier work in that it
makes use of computers develop-
ed primarily since the Second
World War. The use of comput-
ers for textual analysis began in
the 1950’s, and since 1980 signi-
ficant results have become more
and more evident.

The new stylometry has sev-
eral advantages over the older
techniques. I

First, there is a great reduc-
tion in time, effort, and cost.
The Shakespeare Concordance,
which took Bartlett 40 years to
compile, could be done in one
month today. A typical Greek
tragedy now costs only about
$18, or a day's pay, to put in
machine readable form.

A second advantage is that such
projects are now group efforts
rather than the work of one per-
son. A typical group includes a
computer programmer, a mathe-
matical statistician and a liter-
ary scholar. Each can serve as
catalyst to the others.

Formerly the goal of stylome-
try was to identify peculiar char-
acteristics that separate one text
from all other texts. Now the goal
is rather the establishment of
general norms for textual behav-
ior. The computer makes this
physically possible. The British

Albany Red Cross Appeals
To Students For Blood

The importance of the college
student in the success of the
community blood program spon-
sored by the Red Cross in the
Northeastern New York State was
pointed out last week when the
Albany Area Chapter, American
Red Cross appealed to the col-
lege students within the Chap-
ter's jurisdiction to supply 200
units of blood at the Regional
Blood Center, 136 South Lake
Avenue, Albany, on a scheduled
basis between now and the com.
pletion oi the current semester.

The brothers of Alpha Pi Alpha
fraternity have responded to the
appeal by scheduling a blood
drive to be held in the Campus
Center on Tuesday, May 7, from
10 a.m. to 4 pm. The Univer-
sity has been assigned a quota
of 200 blood units.

College students to date have
donated 1,771 units of blood to
the Northeastern New York Re-
gional Blood Program. 0! that
total, 765 units were donated
by the students at the State Uni-
versity Agricultural and Tech-
nical College, Cobleskill. Stu-
dent collections atCobleskill lead
the 20 colleges who are parti-
cipating In the program either
through bloodmobile visists to
their campuses or by individual
student visits to the BloodCenter
in Albany.

William G. Fraser,Chairman
of the Blood Program Commit-
tee, said nine local schools
have been approached during the
past week and asked to provide
student blood donors. They in-
clude Albany Business College,
Albany College of Pharmacy, Al-
bany Law School, College of St.
Rose, Junior College of Albany,
Maria College, Mildred Eiley
Secretarial School, Siena Col-
lege and the State University of
New York at Albany.

Mr. Fraser said college stu-
dents have been most helpful in
the past and have supplied the

- biondpmgram. altitm uch needed

blood for use in our hospitals.

Fraser praised the student
body at Cobleskill for their out.
standing All unit blood donation
at a Red Cross bloodmobile visit
to their campus last week. He
said the 411 units donated un-
doubtedly represented a national
student record based on college
enrollment figures, and that 43
per cent of the Cobleskill stu.
dent body donated at the blood-
mobile visit last week.

The State University at Cob-
leskill recently became the first
receipient of the annual award
for participation in the North-
eastern New York State Red
Cross Blood Program. Student
leaders there plan to better their
record and have said they wel-
come challenges from other col-
leges in the area.

Academy Samples of ancient
Greek texts, which include about
400 textual samples ofabout 2000
words each, provide by means of
the computer a broad basis of
comparison for anyone working
with Greek texts.

Much work has already been
done with classical Greek texts.
Greek works of Homer, Plato,
and Aristotle, as well as of many
other authors, are already In

Lectures

On Communism

by Loren Oatronder

"Naziiem vs. Communism,”
was the title of a lecture given by

r. Leonard Baranski last
Wednesday night. Baranski, who
has participated in a series of
lectures dealing with com-
munism, is brought to the Uni-
versity by the group known as
the Young Americans for Free-
dom or YAF.

Talking to a crowd numbering
about eighty-five, which included
students, adults, and nuns, Ba-
ranski stated that he had seen the
evils that communism produces.

He has spent twelve years he-
hing the iron curtain and five
years in Communist prisons.

In his lecture Baranski stated
that individuals can be built up
by society or society can destroy
individuals.

Throughout the lecture, Baran-
ski stated that with communism
there is no individualism and no
personality. He compared people
under communism and Naziism
as being screws in alvery large
machine. Each person losestheir
human qualities of individualism.

He continued by saying that
“nationalism grows out of the
family" and it is this national-
ism that communism andNaziism
want to destroy.

Baranski feels very strongly
toward everything that he says.
He often stressed how he is
"honest" in what he says and
he is always truthful. He does
not want people to go away from
his lectures doubting the things
that he has talked about.

N.Y. To Host Internt’l

Motorcycle

There's no record of who built
the very first mini-bike or where
it made its debut. The midget-
size motorcycle, most people
agree, got its push into popular-
ity at major US auto race cir-
cuits where safety laws rulled
out the regular full.size motor-
cycle.

Mini-bikes have been standard
equipment in the pit and garage
area at Indianapolis every May
prior to the running of the 500
mile race. At Daytona Interna-
tional Speedway as well as at
Sebring, Florida, race drivers,
car owners and mechanics get
from one place to another, with.
in the circuit area by mini-bike.

This year, for the first time,
New York City will have an In-
ternational Motorcycle Show at
the coliseum from April 11th to
the 14th. In addition to the hun.
dreds of motorcycles, a large
variety of the mini-bikes will be
on exhibition. Mainly of domes-
tic manufacture, this division
now boasts of models made over-
seas as well.

The need for the mini-bike is
not limited to the race crews at
motorsports events. The nauti-
cal contingent, bent on having

greater mobility after tying up
at a visiting marina, often stored
one of the compact scooters
aboard along with the rest of
their gear. In the air, commer-
cial as well as private pilots
have been known to refuse to lift
their aircraft without having first
stored away a mini-bike, their
means of “getting around" once
the plane got to its destination.

Today's modern, lightweight
mini-bikes are easy to operate,
dependable, attain speeds up to
50 mph and can stretch a gallon
of gas to cover over 200 miles.
The sportsman, college student
and business man can tucks mini-
bike away in the trunk of his car,
and can extend his mobility wher-
ever he parks, no matter what
sport he follows. The mini-bikes
are here to stay —- especially in
view of the fact that a brand new
one can be purchased for as lit—
tle as $160.

At the end of this lecture,
films captured in World War II
were shown. The films show the
horror that the Russian Com-
munists inﬂicted on people dur-
ing World War II.

Baranski was received well at
this meeting and he will hold
another lecture in his series
this Wednesday. Everyone in-
terested in learning about Com-
munism from first hand knowl-
edge is urged to attend. The
next meeting will alsoshow films
from World War II.

Baranski will, at his next led
ture, talk more extensively about
the films.

Brandeis Students
Will Avoid Draft

(CPS) Results of a poll of
male seniors at Brandeis Uni.-
versity released this week in-
dicated that 70 per cent of them
will try to avoid the draft.

Of the 180 students polled (out
of a total of 194 male seniors,)
16 said they would go to jail,
and 44 said they would leave the
country rather than accept induc-
tion.

Another 65 said they would
"seek some kind of deferment"
to avoid the draft.

0f the 30 per cent who are
not planning to avoid the draft,
half said they would definitely
serve, the other half were un-
decided.

The poll at Brandeis was one
of several that have been con-
ducted on college campuses since
the new draft regulations were
announced February 15.

The Graduate Student Council
at MIT passed a resolution in
support of those who refused on
moral grounds to serve in the
armed forces while the Vietnam
war is going on.

Computers Analyze

Literary Texts

(Continued [rem Pg. 4)

computer readable form. Much
of this work has been done at
Edinborough. At Liege in France
many classical Latin works have
been translated onto punch cards.

The first step in the new stylo-
metrics is to translate the text
into a form readable in high level
computer language. For small
projects punch cards are used,
while tapes are used for larger
projects.

Next the computer makes a
glossary of the words tint occur
in the text, and then a concor-
dance. Then many tests can be
run such as those to determine
the frequency distribution of
common words, to determine
sentence length distribution, and
to determine the distribution of
the final words in sentences ac-
cording to grammatical types.
Such tests are used to determine
the integrity of a text or to dis-
tinguish authorship of texts.

The evidence from such tests
is always negative in a sense,
since they may show that two
texts or passages are separate
but not that they must belong to-
gether. The results, however.
have been so far very satisfac.
tory. It has been found that the
typical characteristics of sglven
author remain remarkably stable
during his productive lifetime.

Peabody said that in the future
we can expect the isolationofnew
information from texts, infor-
mation that was previously un-
available. We will thereby be able
to resolve problems insoluble
at the present time because of
lack of sufficient information.

Peabody also spoke about the
limitations of the new stylome-
trics. The present approaches
and techniques are relatively
crude. The tests madp seem to
produce spectacular results be-
cause they are the first results
in a new field. To get all the in-
formation out, however, that is
potentially available to us, we
must refine our techniques and
use imagination in our test de-
sign.

Since stylometrics is in its
present form a new field, it Is
still plastic and flexible. It would
be unwise to reject the tech-
niques because of inevitable ini-
tial failures, nor would itbewise
to allow the techniques to be-
come too crystalized. Peabody
warned, "If we become too stan-
dardized and inflexible, we shall
close the door before it is open-
ed."

UNICEF Commends
STB India Food Drive

The brothers of Sigma Tau
Beta fraternity have received a
Certificate of Appreciation from
the United States Committee for
UNICEF for their contribution
of $1,899.75 resulting from the
University's Food forlndiadrive.

The Drive, held on Dec. 15,
1967 raised the funds through
students’ voluntary fasting. For
each student who did not take a
meal in the dining halls, $.75
was donated by Food Service.
Approximately 2,500 students
signed up and participated in the
ast.

Through UNICEF'S Applied Nu-
trition Program the funds raised
will provide 10,000 pounds of
CSM powder (a corn soy milk
protein mixture), enough for daily
milk servings for 4,000 children
for an entire month; a large
incubator with a capacity of 2500
eggs; garden tool kits for 80
school nutrition projects.

The Certificate of Apprecia-
tion was awarded for “ your active
participation in the fight against
hunger, disease and ignorance
among children in the developing
areas of the world.”

Lawyers Begin Study

Of Selective

(CPS) A group of young Wash-
ington lawyers have set up anon-
profit institute to study the se-
lective service system, and to
publish a monthly journal that will
discuss legal issues connected
with the draft.

According to one of its found-
are, Michael Tiger, the Public
Law Education Institute is not
meant to be a draft counseling
center, but rather a center for
careful study of the present draft
system.

'I‘igar explains that he and one
of his co-founders are “terribly
concerned about the designed law-
lessness of the Selective Service
System."

He believes that by dissemin-
ating information about legal as-
pects of the draft, he and other
lawyers at the Institute can do
more to combat unfair aspects
of the draft system than simply
by taking on individual cases.

Head of the Institute is Thomas
Adler, formerly a legislative as-
sistant on Capitol Hill. Tiger will
be editor-in-chief of Selective
Service Law Reporter, the first
issue of which is scheduled to
appear early next month.

The reporter will be mainly
for the use of lawyers, although
Tigar says it should also be use-
ful to draft counselors who are
familiar with the workings of
the selective service system,
and to college administrators
who are charged with advising
students on the draft.

Berkeley, and the head of the
American Civil Liberties Union.

Director, United States Commit-
tee for UNICEF.

Bailey's letter stated: "Stu-
dents at the State University of
New York at Albany — along
with over 100,000 of your fellow
students in the United States—
have shown a high sense of re-
sponsibility, concern, and com-
passion for those in India. Man-
kind now has at its disposal
the know-how, if not the means,
to conquer hunger."

Quake rs Suspend

Vietnam Program

Philadelphia (CPS) — The
American Friends Service Com-
mittee (AFSC) has suspended its
program in Vietnam.

“The Intensified military
operations throughout the coun-
try have resulted in a disruption
of transportation, communica-
tions, supplies, and all phases of
normal civilian life," said
Stephen G. Cary, AFSC associate
executive secretary. “Under
these conditions it is impossible
for us to continue."

The Quakers, who have been
operating a child day-care center
and a rehabilitation service in
Quang Ngai, have announced the
temporary removal of their staff
to Hong Kong to await develop-
ments. They hope to go back as
soon as possible.

Voluntary International Serv-
ice Assignments, or VISA, a
second AFSC program, is also
removing its personnel, young
men and women who have been
serving in individual assign-
ments under indigenous agencies
in Hue, Danang, Vung Tau,
Pleiku, and Saigon itself. The
volunteers are gathering inSinga-

pore to reassess the situation
and the program’s relation to It.

Univ. Reassurcs
Graduate Students

(CPS) At least three universi-
ties are acting to reassure grad-
uate students who may be draft-

ed.

The University of Iowa will
give partial credit to graduate
students drafted in mid-semes-
ter. Students with seven to nine
weeks of work will receive half
credit, 10-12 weeks two-thirds
credit, and 12 weeks or more
full credit.

The University of Chicago has
guaranteed readmittance after
service to graduate students who
are drafted out of graduate
school.

The University of Rochester
(N.Y.) will give "top priority"
for admittance and fellowships
to students draftedinmidsemes-
ter.

Most graduate students will
face induction next fall in the
wake of removal of all graduate
student draft deferments. Unless
changes are made in the order
of call, manpower experts have
said that graduate students and
graduating seniors will fill al-
most all of the draft calls after
June.

Proposed Change
In Food Plan

(Continued [mm l’rtfil' 1)

Considerations expressed by
food services in offering the
proposed meal schedule were:
"(1) limiting the board options
to a reasonable number, (2) in.
corporating a noon meal into the
contract food plans which would
eliminate the undesirable split
shift for food workers and re-
duce the Campus Center noon
meal overload by making better
utilization of our residence hall
dining facilities.

“And, (3) retain the volume
of contract feeding which permits
economy by providing students
with higher quality and greater
quantity of food for their con-
tract board dollar than would be
possible on a cash basis.”

The semester food cost has
also increased. This is due both
to the rising cost of living and
the lowering expected on the
missed meal factor in the pre-
sent plan is 30 per cent, while
on the new plans this is expect.
ed to drop to about 10-15 per
cent.

The additional cost of $40 for
the 20 meal plan is attributed
to the direct cost of food, labor
and overhead.

“The board plan options"
states the Committee report,
“have attempted to satisfy the
concerns of students as reported
in the LAAC survey. For those
students desiring a 20 meal plan,
there is one available; for those
students requesting a flexible
14 meal plan, one is provided."

The number of men entering
graduate school as full-time stu-
dents next fall will be 70per cent
lower than it was last fall, if
the government doesn't change its
current draft policy, according
to a recent report.

The report, based on a survey
conducted by the Council of Grad-

. uate Schools and the Scientific
Manpower Commission (a pri-
vate research organization), also
indicated tint the total enroll-
ment of first-year students in
graduate school next fall will be
50 per cent lower tion it was last
fall.

It went on to say that during
the next academic year, there
will be more women than men in
first-year graduate classes for
the first time since World War

II.

A total of 122 graduate schools,
representing about 40 per cent
of the total graduate enrollment
in the country, were included in
the survey on which the report is
based. The graduate school of-
ficials were asked to give de-
tailed estimates of what their
enrollments would be if no draft-
eligible men are enrolled next
year.

Although the Defense Depart-
ment has said that not all grad.
uate students and college sen-
iors eligible for the draft will
be taken, Mrs. Betty Vetter, ex-
ecutive director of the Scientific
Manpower Commission says that
"almost all” of them will be.

According to Mrs. Vetter, the
Defense Department projections
are based on the assumption that
men under 20 will continue to vol-
unteer for the services to the
same extent they have in the past.
She believes though, that when
18 and 19-year olds learn that

,there's little chance they'll be
drafted, fewer will volunteer than
in the past.
