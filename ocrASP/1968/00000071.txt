Visit Here

Dr. Max M. Scheer, chairman
of the administration committee
of the University of Wursburg,
has been on a visit to the
campus. At the German Univer-
sity new are 27 students from
the Albany institution: and from
State University College at me-
onta as part of an exchange pro-
gram headed at Wursburg by Dr.
Scheer.

Studying at Albany are four
graduate students from the Uni-
versity ofWuraburg. Their major
fields of study are biology, Eng-
lish literature, physics, and pub-
lic administration.

Scheer, a physicist, has com-
mented during his visit on the
experience of the exchange stu-
dents. Of the students he said,
“In the first period oi such an
exchange program most of the
students had difficulties in adapt-
ing to the German language and
customs and to the verydifferent
university system. Consequently,
they had to work hard and were
very successful at the end of the
first semester. Some of the stu-
dents ssked for an extended
period of their stay at
Wursburg."

In speaking of our University,
Scheer noted, “This university
has a very good future and so we
are very glad to have connections
especially with this university.

Vietnam Soldiers Reported
Marijuana

To Be

by Lee Dembort
(Reprinted from the New
York Post)

The lights were low and the
tape recorder was loud, and the
sweet smell of marijuana hung
over the barracks.

And as the soldiers sang they
passed a marijuana cigaret back
and forth among them, breath-
ing deeply and holding down the
smoke and gazing at the walls,
the ceiling and each other.

It is a scene that l have wit-
nessed in almost every major
city in Vietnam, from Saigon to
Hue and Danang in the north,to
Pleiku in the central highlandsfo
Can Tho and Sec Trang in the Me-
kong Delta.

For, though military spokes-
men deny it, a tremendous num-
ber of American servicemen and
civilians are smoking marijuana
on a regular basis. Throughout
the country marijuana is readily
available at unbelievably inexpen-
sive prices and is heavily inuse.

The mere mention of "conxa"
(Vietnamese slangior marijuana)
brings instant recognition from
taxi drivers, sidewalk vendors,
and children playing in the
streets. And the recognition is
invariably followed by the ques-
tion: "How much you buy?"

Prices vary widely, but even at
the highest prices, marijuana
costs a fraction of what it sells
for in the States. As one Air Force
sergeant observed: “A nickel bag
out here costs just that: Five
cents."

Usually marijuana cigarets are
sold, already rolled, in cello-
phane packets of IO. Such apack-
et, containing “joints” the size
of a regular non-filter cigaret,
costs anywhere from $1 to $2.50.

In Cam Ranh Bay, site of a
major U.S. logistics supply area,
almost every bar In the village
will sell marijuana for the ask-
ing. And, says one sergeant sta-
tioned there: "Alot of guys are
doing the asking.”

In one provincial capital in the
Delta, the local CIA "spook," a
Vietnamese with a weighty
French background, is the mari-
juana supplier for the town.

supply, with special bars like
Mom's, cooling in for special
praise from Gla throughout the
capital area. For here instead
of seeing little plates of peanuts
about, a visitor sees little plates
of hashlsh to which customers
are invited to "helpthemselves."

Every month, sources claim,
Camp Zama reports 40000 posi-
tive identifications of marijuana
from Vietnam alone. And,contin-
ue the sources, the number of
people who are caught is insig-
nificant compared with the num-
ber who are smoking.

And the Navy also has its
share of marijuana smokers. One
officer aboard the Bon Homme
Richard confided there was a
"considerable amount" of mari-
juana smoking aboard ship, and
that there had been a number of
administrative discharges be-
cause of marijuana use.

Asked why he thought so many
men in the service were using
marijuana, a general explained
that it was probably because of
the nature of the closed society
where all there is otherwise is
working, eating, sleeping, and

taking in a movie.

Marijuana, he said, seems to
be just one more thing to do to
pass the time. Others disagree.
Said one infantryman who spent
last fall at Dak To during the
battle there:

“You see this guy laying out
there. Maybe he’s your buddy or
cousin. You gotta take some-
thing.”

Dippikill Offers Sauna, Fun "

(Continued from Page .9)

Right now no one lives in the
Goodman Place and people wish-
ing to use it should make ar-
rangements with Jones. Jones
said that he hopes to hire a
“caretaker couple” to live in
this house so that it willbe avail-
able at all timestostudents wish-
ing to stop there without prev-
ious arrangements.

Camp Dippikill, only 75 miles
north of Albany, has 700 acres
of land and scenery. Accommo
dations for 27 people are avail-
able at the Farmhouse which ln-
cludes a kitchen, dining area, and
living room with a fireplace. A
short walk up from the house
one can see a beautiful view of
the surrounding mountains and
woods.

furthering his education through study at the University. Tok-
ing business education, he hopes to return to his country to
teach ortoke a position with a corporation.

Student From Nigeria
Views School, Society

Adekola Odunade, a student
here from Nigeria, enrolled as
a freshman in University Col-
lege, is receiving a firsthand
view of the American college.
Adekola is able to sample dorm
life at the University through his
residence in Johnson Hall.

Adekola is pursuing an educa-
tion in public accounting. He
hopes to do graduate work in this
country and then return to Nigeria
to teach in a university or work
in an established corporation.

As winner of a highly com-
petitive scholarship, Adekola is
able to attend this University and
continue his education. In July,
his wife will join him here and
will be able to stay until he
graduates.

Son of a former member of the
Western Nigeria Parliament,
Adekola was taught in anelemen-
tary school at home. It was dur-
ing this time he acquired an in-
terest in business education.

Education is compulsory In
Nigeria until the child reaches
the age of 12. After that time if
a student wishes to further his
education he must pay for it
himself.

Adekola is amazed at the per-
missiveness of the social norms
in this country. in Nigeria the
social behavior ls closely regu-
lated with respect to dating.
Young couples are allowed to
date only with parental permis-
slon, and then usually, only dur-
ing the day time.

Due to the civil war conditions
and price escalation, it was ex-
pensive for Adekola to leave his
country and come to the U.S.
Nigeria is wealthy in mineral
deposits, control for which has
resulted in strife.

A political party in Nigeria
is usually composed of the mem-
bers of one tribe. For instance,
it is the Blaira tribe which. in
the civil war, is trying to main-
tain control of Eastern Nigeria.

Adekola stated that the people
of Nigeria are relatively pro
gressive and modern in their
ideals, though they seem to re-
main loyal to their tribes. Gov-
ernment positions are inﬂuential,
but the businessmen are wealth-
ier and more comfortable.

Adekola has been a critic of
U.S. foreign policy. While he
lauds the assistance given foreign
nations in the form of food dona-
tions. library grants, and Peace
Corps involvement, Adekola de-
cries tho interventionist role
played by the U.S. in Vietnam.
"So many souls have been lost;
now they're of no use loAmericn

Years ago Camp Board had the
idea of building a lodge facility
on the Dipplklu property. How-
ever, nothing ever became of this
idea until last year when it was
proposed to Central Council that
with the money set aside for cap-
ital development they be allowed
to begin work on a new lodge.

Central Council passed this

unanimously and this year the

architect has been contacted and
work on this project has been
getting under way.

rectangular structure. All at-
tempts will be made to make the
lodge appear as unobtrusive as
possible in a natural setting.
Even though the building of a
lodge would bring more people
to Camp Dippiklll, this area,
with its 700 acres, will still be
able to provide excellent oppor-
tunities for students who enjoy
camping to escape to the out»
