The proposed new meal plan for
the 68-69‘academic year, prepared
by a joint committee of the Office
of Residences and Food Service,
seems to have been devised with
misdirected, if indeed any, con-
cern for the students' wishes as
expressed in the LAAC poll, and
with a major emphasis on facili-
tating the operation of Food Ser-
vice.

Under the thin cloak of infeasi-
bility, the "any 14 meal plan"
overwhelmingly favored (lSSO-yes,
272-no) was rejected. The reasons
given were impossibility of pre-
diction of the quantity of food to
be prepared and the imcompara-
bility of the cost of the three
meals.

First, on the incomparability of
costs. The prices of breakfasts
and lunches can easily be equal-
ized by providing decent meals
in both cases. Costs can then be
computed on a 7 dinner plus 7
breakfast-or-lunch basis.

And as to the predictability,
how does Food Service now de-
cide how much food to prepare?
From all indications, at the be-
ginning oi each semester they
take an educated guess and then
modify, their routine in the light
of the number of students who eat
each meal.

Very similar to this problem is
that which the transfer of meal
tickets from one dining area to
another presents. Plans for such
a transfer have long been staved
off by the very same argument
(two years ago prediction of
amounts of food for each dining
area under a transfer system was
a positively insurmountable dif-
ficulty), however, now we find that
this high-hurdle can be leaped,

And as to the proposed 14 and
20 meal plans, we find these totally
unacceptable in the light of the
student opinion expressed in the
LAAC poll, In fact, they are
even worse than the present meal
plan. Both of these proposals force
the student who eats breakfast or
lunch plus dinner to pay for all
three meals, and to pay even more
than before.

The increase in cost is pri-
marily due to the predicted low-
ering in the percentage of missed
meals, now at an alarming 30

Plans - Unacceptable

    
   
    
 
 
  
           

per cent.

1158 of the students polled re-
sponded nagatively to the 20 meal
plan question which was worded
"Would you be in favor of the
addition of a third daily meal
under board contract. The Com-
mittee entirely ignored the major-
ity view on this. The students who
said "we don’t want a third meal
added" now have no choice.

Furthermore, it appears from
the statements issued by the com-
mittee that the real reason behind
adding the third meal was
to "eliminate the undesirable split
shift for food workers" and “make
better utilization of our residence
dining facilities" among other
similar considerations.

On closer inspection of the com-
mittee report, a further inequity
comes to light. Up until this time
a breakfast only or dinner only
option has been available to off-
campus students; now it is be-
ing discontinued because on-cam-
pus students do not enjoy these
options. Why were these not in-
cluded in the on-campus plan?

in fact, this may be the very
plan in which many students would
be interested; they might get what
they pay for. This in addition to
the blanket plans for those who
wish them, would result in an
acceptable, and feasible meal pro-
gram.

Finally, there is the "no board"
option, or rather lack of it.

The excuses for not offering a
no board option include:

(1) lack of knowledge of what
effect the new plans will have on
costs,

(2) preference of having one
year's experience with the plans
to determine the acceptibility on
the part of students,

(3) expectation that students are
not intelligent enough to base a
decision to opt no board on the
basis of the proposed plans and
not those of the '67-'68 year,

(4) that again the students would
not consider the transfer privilege
in making a no board decision
("it is important, therefore, that
the students have an opportunity
to try this new apprOach before
making a no board option avail-
able."),

(6) responsibility to make use

New Deal — 'C.A.’s, Transfers

The imminent end of the acade-
mic year brings consideration of
the impending Summer Planning
Conference, an institution very
close to excellence, yet thwarted
in achieving It because of the
remuneration for the Conference
Assistants and of theTransfer Stu-
dent conferences.

Under the present system, con-
ference assistants, who perform
the duties of clerks, social direc-
tors, nurse maids, counselors, in-
formation bureaus and campus
guides, receive in payment for
their services room, board and
cash totaling to an approximate
amount of $600. The conference
assistants work officially about
40 hours a week, and unofficially
24 hours per day for a five day
week. The cash breakdown then
averages out to about $1.25 per
hour for the hours officially put
in by the conference assistants.

But, if the C.A. is considered
working around the clock he earns
$.24 per hour.

Such a figure cannot be justi-
fied, even with the consideration
of room and board for the eight
weeks, when the employed indi-
viduals' qualifications are consi-
dered. Those attracted toward
such a summer position are gen-
erally student leaders with a gen-
uine interest in the University

Their competence in fulfilling
the 'official‘ duties of their job
is unquestionable, but in compar-
ison to the unofficial duties the

of the facilities provided (Le. re-
sidence dining halls) without un-
duly restricting the student.

The fact that the total plan
proposed “goes much further than
the majority of universities" is
immaterial. The fact that under
the guise of giving students what
they want, the committee has facili-
tated the operation of food Service,
and thrown the students the crumb
of transferable meal tickets, is
material.

When any part of the adminis-
tration decides to cram something
down the students’ throats, they
might as well come right out and
say so. And if this report was
to be subtle about it, it failed.

Conference Assistants perform
these official services seem insig-
nificant. ln urging for a raise in pay
for the Conference Assistants we
in urging for a raise in pay for
the Conference Assistants we
would also bring to mind their
role as ambassadors of the Uni-
versity to the new student is
beyond any monetary value.

A pay raise is feasible through
a modest raise in the conference
fee. An additional $2.50 solicited
from incoming students would ade-
quater provide a salary commen-
surate with the Conference assist-
ants’ job and possibly enable the
University to increase the number
of assistants employed.

The second matter retarding the
effectiveness of the planning con-
ference as a whole concerns the
transfer student’s segment.

Transfer students do not
need instruction in what the gen-
eral college experience would be
like, what they need is a pre-
sentation of college life at this
University. included in this should
be the guided tour of the campus
which was given to freshmen but
not transfers this past summer.

Of prime concern to the trans-
fer student in his academic situa-
tion. During the planning confer-
ences, academic advisement is
made by some faculty members
available during the summer. in
most cases these will not be
permamentiy assigned to the stu-

dents. .
[‘00 many instances of sun met

misadvisement have resulted in
transfers learning late in their

junior or senior vear that they
must spend an additional summer

or semester in school to meet
requirements they were not aware
of when they first preregistered
during the summer.

More openings in courses should
also be provided for transfers,
particularly upperclass transfers,

We would ask for a reconstruc-
tion of the transfer planning con-
ferences to meet the pecular needs
of transfers and to eleminate the
sugary dose of college life that
is dished out to freshmen. To
realize such a reform, successful
transfer students now enrolled in
the University could be of valuable
aid, in planning the summer con-
ferences.

Y Bill Rohdo

 

Americans are an innocent
people. And it is therefore
not surprising that we watched
President Johnson's Sunday night
spectacular with such delight. it
is a measure of the effectiveness
of Lyndon Johnson's consensus
Presidency tint we reactedtothe

-' apparent and of his era withajoy

usually reserved for the end of
major wars.

1 was quite sure that LBJ had
lost the capacity of touching even
the most sentimental of our peo-
ple. But on Sunday night and then
after his Chicago speech, you
heard college kids speak ofJohn-
son as if he was a popular Presi-
dent who had died in office.

Even i could see why he was
called a "profile in courage" and
a "man above Politics." But
when i noticed even my most
anti-Johnson and anti-war friends
praising the President's courage
and nobility, I grew suspicious.

Could it be that Johnson had
decided to risk all on the great-
est political gamble in our his-
tory? He has effectively silenced
his opposition. McCarthy and
Kennedy seem thoroughly dis-
comfited — on Monday night’s
Cronkite show every national fig-
ure from Kennedy to Goldwater
praised the President.

Nixon says he can no longer
criticize the war, and even
George Wallace concurred. it
looks like Lyndon Johnson has ac-
complished the impossible — af-
ter three years of incessant de-
bate and dissent, he has totally
subdued his opposition.

Again he is “President of all
the people." And nowMike Mans-
field calls for a draft Johnson
movement.

Perhaps, i am guilty‘ of un-
warranted cynicism. But let us
not forget who is responsible for
today’s skepticism and distrust,
it is no one else but this same
Lyndon Johnson who we today
eulogize. For the Johnson pres-
idency has been so riddled with
duplicity, so divisive an influ.
once that we can only be most
wary.

He has lied to us too often.
Was it not Johnson who engineer-
ed the "Great Betrayalofi964"?
Was it not Johnson who, again
with the same "sincerity" we saw
Sunday, said that he would not
allow Americans to fight inawar
that Asian boys should be tight-
ing’f
Was it not this same Johnson
who in his generosity offered
us 38 sham peace feelers fol-
lowed by 88 long planned escala-
tions? And was it not this same
Johnson who drove even his most
devoted servants from public
life?

And less than a month ago
was it not this same Johnson who
with the ultimate crassness al-
lowed his agents to accuse Sena-
tor McCarthy of fronting for
Hanoi?

We must not allow sentimen-
tality to obscure the fact that
Lyndon B. Johnson and no one
else is responsible for thetragic
situation existing in our nation to.

y.

Of his presidency it can be said
that he came into office with the
country shattered by assassina-
tion and that he is leaving the
scene with the nation more di-
vided than it has been in 107
years.

And that one speech does not
really change anything. As John-
son said Monday "Eternal vigil-
ance is the price of liberty."
i feel that we must still be vigil-
ant, we still have 290 days left
of the Johnson are. There can
be no talk of drafting Lyndon
Johnson. We must not forget
what he has done to our nation
in four years.

We must now begin work for a
better America. The one alterna-
tive to Lyndon Johnson is Sena-
tor Robert F. Kennedy. For the
past four years he has symbol-
ized opposition to the Johnson
leadership. Like Senator McCar-
thy and unlike the other candid-
ates, he does not offer 1960 solu-
tions to the problems of 1970.

And the self-righteous Mr. Johan ‘

son should love taught us one
lesson. A President must have
the capacity of self-doubt.

Robert Kennedy has this cap-
acity and this may be what sop-
miss him from all the other
contenders. The times do not re-
quire the rigid simple solutions
of an earlier on. The complex
dilemmas of 1968 demand that we
elect Robert Kennedy — "our

Jean-Paul Sartre believes that
men are responsible for theirm
destinies. “Man is nothing else
than his plan," says Sartre, and
continues, "he is therefore noth-
ing else than the ensemble of his
acts." Translated into political
terms, this comes out as: people
get the kind of government they
deserve.

If Americans are responsible
for the kind of government they
have, maybe the excuse "due to
extenuating circumstances"

helps soften the blame. The ex.-
tonusting circumstances are the
untruths the American leader-
ship has fed the people. A good
example of this are the events
which led to the bombing ofNoi-th
Vietnam.

The

 

Right Way

by Robert Isemnn

 

 

For the past few years there
has been almost as much specula-
tion as to what constitutes respon-
sible dissent as there has been
about the war in Vietnam itself.
With a presidential election in 6
months, and constant political
activity up to that time, there is
bound to be extensive discussion
and debate about the war.

During this hectic political per-
iod we must strive to show the
enemy a united front, but at the
same time offer the American
people an alternative to the pres-
ent policy. This can only be ac-
complished through the respon-
sible behavior of those who op-
pose the war. Since college stu.
dents play such an active part in
the political process, they have
just as much of an obligation to
speak responsibly as the present
national leaders and candidates.

The appearance of Walter

Tongue of the US. Committee
to Aid the National Liberation
Front at the University provided
an excellent example of the
strange attitudes held by some
of our fellow students. Teague ad-
vocated the victory of the Viet
Cong over American forces. He
began his program by showing
a ridiculously corny pro-Com-
munist film. it showed the peo-
ple of Vietnam happily working,
brightly smiling, and wildly
praising their Viet Cong "liber-
stars."

1 would not deny Teague the
right to speak on Campus, hull
was amazed at the number of
supposedly intelligent students
who literally ate up everything
Teague said. Through his actions
this man is killing American Gl’s
just as surely as if he was using
a gun. Yet, there sat the Com-

 

 

The Portside

once upon a time there was a
free man in a free society in a
free world. And he said to him-
self every day, "Oh, how free!
am. isn't it wonderful?" He had
lots of choices with very few
echoes, good food, a good wife,
good newspapers, a good job, and
no termites in his house. He was
very happy, indeed. He even got
to choose his leaders, by the nov-
el way of flipping a coin. Every
four years, coins were minted,
with a candidate on the head
side, and a candidate on the tail
side. Each voter would take his
coin (a large silver one) to the
flipping place. There, before a
secret camera, he would flip
his coin, his choice would be re-
corded and he would go home.
There were lots of little copper
coins around, but as they were
not given out by the State, no
one paid mueh attention to them.

i can’t tell you the end of the
story, because i don't know it.
it's a parable and "lie that hath

ears to hear. . ."

Marxists view human freedom
dialectically, and i am going to
try to explain how we differ from
our opponents, and how our con-
cept of freedom is anything but
pernicious. i shall not attempt
to gloss the obvious denials of
freedom in the U.S.S.R., China,
and in Cuba which is freer than
the others; i only point out that
seemingly no great idea escapes
the taint of denying freedom to
some. Roman Catholics still oc-
casionally apologize for the ln-
quisition and the Book index,
Lutherans for Luther’s role in
the Thirty Years’ War, and our
Founding Fathers for treatment
of counter - revolutionaries —
Tories. As for dictatorships in
the “Socialist bloc," capitalists
should remove the beam in their
own eyes, i.e., Rhodesia, South
Africa, Greece, and Vietnam,
etc. Yet, people still bring up
the lack of electoral choice in
the Socialist bloc vs.our system.

are whizzing by their heads, l'm

gave Teague.

As a result of Teague's visit,
I think that there are some ques-
tions that the Committee should
be asked. First and very simply,
Whose side are you on anyway?
it it comes down to a choice be-
tween an American life and a
Vietnamese life, which do you
choose? I’ll take the American

Nationally, candidates and offi-
cials should communicate their
policies to the public, but in a
manner that does not encourage
the enemy. No candidate should
advocate "peace at any price."
We must not allow the Commum
lots to win at the polls inNovem-
her, now that they have failed to
win in the battlefield. Suggestions
like the ‘ “ RF’K ‘ ‘ ‘
that we should donate blood to the
Viet Cong must not be repeated.
The public can be made well
aware of what Kennedy, McCar-
thy, Fulbright etc. stand for with-
out them ranting and raving about
"tragic U.s. mistakes" and how
“we must get out regardless of
the consequences."

The American people must
hear both sides, but Hanoi must
not continue to hear the sounds
of disunity. As former President
Eisenhower said, “In a long life
of service to my country, lhave
never encountered a situation
more depressing than the present
spectacle of an America deeply
divided over a war. . . .What has
become of a noble concept called
patriotism, which in former
times of crisis has carried us
through to victory and peace?"
in times of national peril we all
should remember the things that
our nation has given us and ask
ourselves, For all these things
don’t 1 owe the U.S. a little old-
fashioned loyalty and devotion?

Tonkin. According to testimony
given I August 6, two thys after
the incident, former Secretary of
Defense McNamara said, "The
attack was carried out at night. . .
it was a promediatsd attack, a
pre lanned attack."

s picture of "unprovoked
aggression" was further magni-
fied and smotionalisod by the
President in his televised state-
ments after the attacks. The re-
sults were the bombing, and the
passage of tho Tonkin resolu-
tion, a bill which gave the ad-
ministration carto blancho pow-
ers to one: to aha war.

Last mont ,t roe-snd-ono-lulf
years after the Tonkin affair, the
Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee pointed out the fallacies
behind the Administration's ver-
sion of what happened that fateful
night. Senator Wayne Morse, a
senior member of the commit.-
tee, referred to these fallacies
in a March ’1 speech. He said that
"on August.6, 1964, the Secre-
tary of Defense stated before the
Committee that the Maddox (one
of the ships) was operating in in-
ternational waters, and was
carrying out a routine patrol . ..
That was a misstatement. The
Maddox was a spy ship at that
time under instruction to stimu-
late electronic instruments of
north Vietnam. That s notarou-

ne patrol for a sstroyer."
Morse went on to say that the
patrol of the Maddox and Turner
Joy was coordinated with opera-
tions of the South Vietnamese
against Northern coastal areas.
These operations included the
bombardment of radar sites and
security posts.

in other words, the two des-
troyers were participating in
hostile actions against North
Vietnam at the time they were
“ “ ‘ ‘ " This is far differ-
ent from the Administration’s
version of "unprovoked" as.
saults. The official account he-
comes even more doubtful when
we learn that Hanoi warned the
United States, only days before,
that "0.5. ships in the Gulf of
Tonkin will no longer be con-
sidered neutrals . . . They will
be treated as belligerents from
first detection." Despite these
warning our ships continued their
provocative maneuvers.

Why did our ships provoke
North Vietnamese retaliation
and then call it "aggression?"
Why did McNamara, Rusk, and
others deceive Congress and the
people? The answer to many of
these questions are buried in
"classified" material, but some
political analyists have ventured
guesses. LF. Stone, the Wash-
ington-based political observer,
claims that the escalation policy
was pre-meditated. “The Bomb-

Pan Hell:

It’s All Greek To Me...

Y Maggie Dlotr

 

 

 

Each fraternity and sorority
has been asked to elect a Fan.
Hellenic Council Officer for next
year so that the new represen-
tatives may hold their first meet-
ing on Tuesday, April 23.

The new representatives may
be either juniors or seniors(pre-
ferably a person who will not be
student teaching), and must have
been an active member of their
fraternity or sorority for at least
one full year.

l'm asking each group to choose
this officer carefully, consider-
ing the Greek system as awhole,
and the significant contribution
Greeks can and do make in Uni-
versity life and activities.

The present Pan - Hellenic
Council is in the process of pre-
paring an Annual Report so that
next year's Council will have
duties and ideas to work with as
they see fit.

This year's Pan-Hall was new-
ly-organlzed, including members
from lFC and lSC, but working
as an “issues and concerns"

body, seeking to promote the uni-
fied influence of all Greeks on
Campus. It provides a forum for
the exchange of ideas concerning
the affairs of Greeks in relation
to the University Community and
the Comnnmity-at-large.

Through Pan-Hell, Greeks are
represented on Central Council
and the Committee on Student
Government and Organizations.
In addition to needed dialogue
between fraternities and sorori-
ties, Pan-Hell also provides the
opportunity for meaningful
Greek-Faculty - Administration
interaction at all levels of Uni-
versity Activity.

One member from each fra-
ternity and sorority works with
University Administrators and
student Activities Advisers to
promote communication of Fac-
ulty concerns and student ques-
tions.

Pan-lieu also works with the
Alumni Affairs Office to encour-
