Out of Focus
To the editor:

The March 15 issue of The
ASP contath a column by M.J.
Roseldrerg. lts title was “.0ff
Center” but it might well have
tied “out of Focus."
The incredme poor taste of the
adolescent-homered cartoon is

caption demonstrates a truthtiiat
Mr. Rosenberg and other over-
sentimentalizing Americans
seem to have forgotten. i.e. when
an Arab refers to Israel as " My
Lamis" he is ever so correct
in his choice of personal pro-

nouns.

The truth of the matter is that
lsrael is built on Arab land
and would not existtodayifli
were not for the support of the
U.S. it must also be admitted
that the success of Israel's es.
pansionist war of last summer
was due to the U.S.'s acqui-
esence.

For Mr. Rosenberg to accuse
the U.S. state Department of
Nazism, anti-Semitism and anti-
ztonism would be humorous if
it were not so insidious. Are
we to see lsrael become another
Germany? Are we to hear cries
for “Living Space" as justifi-
cation for the violation of ter-
ritorial integrity? is the free
world to be prevented from half.-
ing a campaign of “lsrael Irre-
dentie” because of the M.J.
Rosenbergs oi the U.S. silence
all protest with the invocation
of the horrors of Auschwitz and
Dachau?

What appeal can be made to
lsrael? The fantach presump-
tion of the U.S. and Britain in
implemendu the Balfour De-
claration vitiates any appeal
based on national sovereignty
in the Middle East. The opened

Pandora's Box of lsrael's
establishment may well prove
tobetmcioseble.

i would not expect the M.J.
Rosenbergs to openly acknow-
ledge the weak moral position
of israel, but i would hope that
they could refrain from confus-
ing the issues currently before
us by strewing the paths oidis-
cussion with the red-herrings of
gas vans andsimplistic equations
of anti-Semitism with anti-Zion-
ism.

It will take considerably more
than the confused protestations
and Joe McCarthy-like tactics
of Mr. Rosenberg combined with
the purchasing power oi Zion.

Open Letter

To the Editor and especially the
Class of '71: .

l am answering Mr. Tradeau’s
letter of last week to the ASP
because I feel there has been
some rattler unfair and unfound-
ed statements made by Mr. Trar
deau. The purpose oi this letter
will be to explain “Class Coun-
cil" to you the Freshman Class
and to give some of the details
on the class's weekend.

The “class council” that Was
elected In the Fall was rather
unique in the fact that no other
class had ever elected a council
before. The council was the con-
ception oi our class guardians.
l wonder if Mr. Tradeau was
aware oi this?

Secondly, I wonder If many
F reshmen are aware oi how class
councils are chosen by the other
classes at Albany? The other
class councils are appointed by
the elected officers of the class.
This is the way your class coun-
cil was chosen also.

It Is important for us to con-
sider the reason for a class
council. The class council exists
now as an advisory board to the
officers, and it Is by no means
a group oi simply "yes men."

  COMMUNICATIONS

B setting up a class council
w: the officers of the Freshman
class desired in noway tolimit
participation inclass government ,
to a small group of people.

We encourage all interested
Freshman to attend class meet-
ings. Any one who is willing to
work for the Class of ’71 is in-
vited to attend our meetings. Amr-
ons who desires the class's sup-
port or has ideas for furthering
the class's spirit is also wel-
come. This was stated in the
miniaes of the first class meet-
ing, which were posted in every
Freshman dorm. i hope some oi
the misunderstandings about
your class government has been
cleared up.

Secondly, let's clear up the
misunderstanding about the class
weekend. 1 in no way have tried
to discredit the people who laid
his 'groundwark' for the week-
end. When the new class officers
took office, whichby the waywas
riult after our inauguration, we
were presented with the problem
of Freshman weekend.
groundwork may have been laid,
but, the arrangements for the
weekend especially the Mohawk
outing were far from complete.
Through the herd of the entire
council and several people out-
side oi council the details oi
the weekend were worked out
and completed.

Our only purpose has been
to make this class the best class
in the history oi Albany state.
i hope we win succeed in our
purpose, and I hope that more
oi you the Class oi '71 will
take an active part in your class
government.

President, Class oi ’71

ASP’s Lack

To the Editor:

As a college student involved
only indirectly with the SUNY
Albany Community, 1 read with
interest the various accounts and
comments on the Feb. 21 demon-
stration on your campus.

What concerned me most about
the columns and letters in the
March 1 issue of the ASP was
the glaring lack of rationality
and objectivity on the part of
both right and left-wing corres-
pondents.

Since I agree with Mr. Sim-
mons opposition to the war In
Vietnam, 1 was especially dis-
turbed by his apparent lack of
understanding regarding the Im-
plications of his actions against
the Dow recruiter.

I, too, am horrified by napalm;
I participated In a peaceful
demonstration on my campus
against Dow. But Mr. Simmons
does not seem to realize that by
physically obstructing access to
the recruiter, he was Indulgingln
a type of moral absolutism which
is inherently dangerous to any
person who happens to subscribe
to unpopular political views.

That is to say, by declang
that he has a monopoly on truth,
that he Is instilled In imposing

his morality on other people,
Mr. Simmons leaves himself open
to the most heinous sort of
iascitic repression imaginable.

If you,Mr.SImmons,as a mem-
ber oi a political monorlty group,
claim to be able to force other
people to accept your positions,
what 15 to prevent the majority-
who happen to hold all the so-
culled legitimate power Inth so-
ciety - from imposing Its will
on you? And on me?

Dow 15 not the only form In
the United States which contri-
butes to the war effort. US Steel,
General Motors, and many other
industries are engaging in, from
my point of view, morally re-
prehensible acts by supporting
an immoral war.

But my point is not that all
such companies should be
picketed, not that all should be
permitted to recruit at will on
your campus.

Regarding your article "Con-
ference issues Emphasize Tac-
tics” by Kathy Deyoe she did I
good job of reporting, in general.

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

But i think she made an error
in quoting Noam Chomsky (on
2

m’paragraph implies that the
only weapon the 0.8. people have
to terror. He said, "that the
only weapon the Vietnamese peo-
ple have Is their terror.” This
was because the people in Viet-
nam have a government put In
by the U.S. military. The Viet-
namese government Is not ade-
mocracy in the way we would
define a democracy.
other than this, i feel Miss
Deyoe did a very good job oi
reporting.

Kennedy In ’68

To the Editor:

Robert F. Kennedy’s candidacy
for the presidency should bewel-
comed by anyone who wishes to
see anendtothewarinViet-
nam. Despite his untimely entry
into the Presidential race, Ken-
nedy should be supported.

True, Eugene McCarthy ap-
pears to be the more idealistic
and braver politician, but these
qualities do not win elections.
(Remember Adali Stevenson,
bless him?)

The American public has to
out politic die politicians; what
is important this year is that
the candidate who can end the
war be elected. LBJ doesn'twant
to, Nixon wouldn’t and McCarthy
can't. That leaves Bobby.

Threat

To the Editor:

Although I was threatened on
March 15 by some unknown Zion-
ists in this campus and warned
not to write any more letters
to the editor (.") Nevertheless,
as long as arguments such as
Miss Miller's are presented, I
can not help but want to refute
them. She, for example, chose
an Arab doctor who wrote In the
Israeli “Jerusalem Post"
against the Arab caus How-
ever, Miss MIller failed 0 real-
ize that there are many more
Jews who are "unsympathetic"
with the ZionistNationailst cause
then there are Arab apostates. I
could list innumerable Jewish au-
thors who wrote not just articles
but 'books' against the State of
Israel, (Cohen, Lllienthal et. a1.)
Space limits me however, to only
excerpts oi a letter written by
Moshe Menuhin, father oi Yehudi
Menuhin, who wrote in the Los
Gatos Times on August 31, 1967:

"Prophetic Judaism is my re-
ligion, not Napalm Judaism, ——
Jewish Nationalism. The "Jew.
ish Nationalists —— the new speci-
men of fighting Jews -—- are not
Jews as far as lam concerned,
but "Jewish" Nazis who have
lost all sense oi Jewish morality
and humanity. Anti-Zionism is not
anit-Semltlsm."

“With all the . . . image build.
ing, with torrents oi sophisticat-
ed and astutepubllcityglmmlcks,
polemical rhetoric, hiding oi
facts and rewriting of history, it
remains a tragic FACT that the
"Jewish" nationalists .. . took
away by force oi arms, terror
and atrocities the homes, the
land, and the homeland oi the
Arab peasants, workers, and
merchants In old Palestine. . .

"The leader of the Israeli
“IRGUN” terrorists, Menachem
Begin, tells It in a few boastful
words, "Al the Jewish forces
proceeded to advance like akniie
through butter . . . the Arabs
began to flee In panic shouting,

Deir Yassin." In Deir Yassin,
on April 10, 1948, 245 Arab
men, women and children were
butchered in cold blood and their
mutilated bodies were thrown Into
a well . . . Deir Yassln ls just
one example of the atrocities
committed to force the Arabs
out oi their homeland. . ."

These quoted words mayprove
to Miss Miller and others who
are concerned in this campus
that there is "Always another
side to the Arab-Israeli Conﬂict.

Sad Commentary — Administrations’ Understanding

by S. L. Brockhouse

 

View From

by M.o.s., and M.A.D.

The Behind

 

 

 

 

The events of this last Sunday
evening have put the President
in a different lightthanthe scorn-
fui one in which he has been
cast for the past several years.
Even among the President's most
severe critics, one gets the im-
pression that there is a feeling
of sympathy. This sympathy may
very well he deserved, for the
President has held his office in
a period oi history which will
likely be judged one of the most
difficult and frustrating.

Despite our personal feelings
toward the President after last
Sunday evening‘s address, each
must be judged on what he has
done and not on what he has
hoped to do.

in the last ten years, espe-
cially, the commentary on the ap
parent understanding of history
and its workings by the members
of the different administrations
has been a rather sad one. This
has at least in part contributed
to the hazardous situation that
this country presently finds it.
self in.‘

The obvious illustration of this
point is the Russo-Japanese War
of 1905. In the early years oi
this century Russia was under-
going a period of stress and in-
ternal turmoil. The Russian Min-
ister of interior Plehve, com-
menting on the domestic prob-
lems oi Russia with regard to the
Russo-Japanese War stated: "We
need a small victorious war to
stem the tide of revolution."
Russia lost that war and the
Tsarist government was made
ineffectual, only to fall a. dozen
years later.

Today, the United States is
also going through a period where
there are many domestic prob-
lems which must be faced. The
United States is also involved in
a foreign war, but for far dif-
ferent reasons than those of the
Russians in 1905. Though the
United States has not suffered
such a defeat as Russia, there
is a growing trend toward dis-
al activism un-

common to this country.

The current situation in this
country is one in which many
domestic reforms are deeper-
ately needed, especially in the
urban slums. The programs of
reform are being sacrificed In
order to carry out our commit-
ment in Vietnam. We are faced,
this summer, with the prospect
of mass-participation violence In
the streets of every city in the
country.

Where all of this will event-
ually lead, no one can say with
any great certainty, but judg-
ing from times in the post where
a significant number of people
have become discontent with the
society in which they live, one
must accept the possibility that
the stability of the government

may be jeopardized by extremists
on both sides oi the political
spectrum.

it is ironic that President John-
son has recently begun to com-
pue himself to such figures as
Winston Churchill. One recalls
Churchill’s observation that
"When armies apprth each
other it makes all the difference
which owns only the ground on
which it stands or sleeps and
which one owns all the rest."
It would seem that the Presi-
dent had not read this statement
by Churchill when he drew that
comparison, but perhaps some-
time beiore his address to the
nation last Sunday he did read
and ponder that observation of
nations at war.

it has been quite a while since
we have done so, so we thought
we would impart to you some of
the rumors that we have heard
around campus the past several
weeks:

As the result of an ASP edi-
torial, Evan R. Collins has asked
Gov. Rockefeller to call out the
National Guard to help clean up
the garbage in room 13-41 of the
Campus Center.

The same group who petitioned
Central Council for a longer in-
tersesslon, but had no plans for
how to manage it is now pre-
paring petitions to God for a
longer summer, to LBJ for less
taxes, and to Faculty Senate for
higher grades. Sign up will be
in the Campus Center lobby all
next week.

The family situation has chang-
ed. Our great uncle has pulled
a coup, the likes of which I
can't remember.

A cousin in Vietnam recently
published a poem in the family
journal (Stars & Stripes), that
goes like this:

Tarnlshed mirror, I look and see

Dangling puppets, dead on a
string.

Slaughter in a carpetbag

That’s tearing at the seam.

Tears spill on your rosy cheeks:
Child, do you know?

1 am going to war
Tomorrow.

Cry, cry loud.

Then the world will watch

Those tears drop down so slow.
All that is part of the past.

Uncle has exploded the status

quo with two decisions. First-

ANECDO'I‘ES

This wall will be out In paper-
back form soon!

Did you hear about the man who
was part Negroid and part Ja-
panese? Every December he
bombs Pearl Balley.

These are actual comments writ-
ten by state students. 1 would
like to thank the contributors for
cooperating to make the exhibit
a rousing success.

The season for politics, both
on campus and off, is now upon
us. A great deal of the election-
eerlng in the presidential raceis
In our hands, and predictably,we
are handllng it Ideallstlcully.

Idealism Is not a bad word, but
there are certain responsibilities
which go along with the idealistic
support of the candidates by col-
lege students. One of these, In
fact the primary one, is my stock
expression-rational thought.

Many of the candidates for the
office of President of the United
States are taking stands which
will appeal to the attitudes of co!-
loge students who are searching
for peace. The combatants iortho
Democratic nomination. exclud-
ing the incumbent LBJ, are at
present sharing the attentions of
the Americans who are looking
for peace.

I don't intend to campaign, in
this column, for either of the two
Democratic hopefuls. What [will
do is propose what I (on! i '

ly, he gave up the position
of leadership he's held in the
family. Secondly, he has decided
to curb the operations of the
family’s special police force,
halting most of the bomb runs
on the criminal abode.

The family is in complete dis-
array at the first stratagem. I
personally think, cousin, that the
second nostrum Is even more In-
teresting. Perhaps the family
business will be tended to, now
that the crime fighting has taken
a. new twist.

The family's recent history has
been disconcerting in itself. Cou-
sin Bobby (you know,irom Mass.)
promised, beiore uncle Lyndon's
latest escapade, to set things
straight by playing in the to-
trennial Biggest Flea on the Don-
key's Derriere contest, giving
cousin Eugene the winnings.

Meanwhile, the black sheep of
the Eisenhower side of the fam-
ily, the golf pros who don't read
newspapers, is looking fora new
judas goat. Cousin Dick claims
that he's safe from slaughter,
since there’s not an honestly
tasty morsel in his body.

Hurrah for good old cousin
Dick! I think he’s stumbled on-
to the right track; hope It doesn’t
shock him.

What will the family do next?
1 don’t know. If we hold asym-
bolic funeral for uncle Lyndon,
then perhaps we'd better stage
it In Phoenix, Arizona. Whether
hawk or dove, who can be sure
that the Byrds won't rise anew,
out of the ashes.

Telephone lines buzz with ry-
mor and speculation. The fam-
ily meeting In November pro-
mises to be interesting, indeed.

verse position and support John-
son's tax increases to pay for
the war. Have cake and eat It
much?

Senator Robert F. Kennedy will
admit that it is really he who is
running for the presidential no-

mination, not the ghost of his
late brother as he has been try-
ing to make us believe.

No one in the government will
realize that such true statements
as "It is even awkward for both
of them (Kennedy it McCarthy) to
run on the same ticket for Presi-
dent and VP nominees, since both
of them are Roman Catholics."
(James Reston, NY Times 3-31-
69) has something to do with why
"the bitterness against the whole
system could become a very real
problem In the major universities
of the nation." (lbld) One would
be bad enough, huh? A nation of
bigots and idiots.

in case of a stalemate at the
Democratic Convention this sum-
mer, Kennedy and McCarthy
forces have decided to throw
their support behind Harold Stas-
sen.

Lyndon Johnson will run for the
U.S. Senate against John Tower to
get his old seat back. Why not?
He's backstabbed all of his other

Review oi the New Right Wing

by Roy Bertrand

 

lsrael Is an extremely small
nation on the eastern shore of
the Mediterranean Sea. Born in
1948, it is flanked by Lebanon,
Jordan, Syria, and Egypt. Left-
ists have accused this young coun-
try of unprovoked aggression
against these four nations in ac-
cordance with a Zionist plot.

The United States government,
although it may not be cognizant
of the fact, has a great stake in
Israel, as do all democratic ad-
ministrations in the world. Is-
rael Is the the sole nation in the
Middle East whose history sub-
stantiates It to be anti-Commun—
ist, peace-loving and demo-
cratic.

Nasser’s Egypt Is the direct
antithesis of these attributes. But
Uncle Sam, partly because of its
prolonged engagement in South.
east Asia and partly because of
its Interest in the vast oil re-
serves oi some Arab nations,has
been neutral officially.

The argument that lsrael was
the aggressor in the Six-Day War
is absurd. They may have launch-
ed the first offensive, but this
doesn't necessarily warrant the
title of Zionist aggression. An

an equitable solution to our diffi-
culties, and suggest that a.! clue
consider it, or like proposals,be-
fore we work too ardently for
either of these men.

Any of you who have ever taken
an introductory course in anthro-
plogy know that the basic cause
of war Is a conflict between the
norms of two or more cultures or
societies. War is fought on the
premise that the stronger of the
cultures has been able to take ad-
vantage of Its opponent(s)’ weak-
nose.

The other solution that has of-
ten been found to the conflict of
norms Is what we refer to as ne-
gotiation. By this means the battle
between the societies may be
avoided or stopped.

Negotiation, and cooperation
after negotiation, Is what lpro-
pose to be the ideal solution to
the problem which faces us inour
various conflicts with "('OIIIIWI.

To negotiate lntelllgently, the
parties Involved mustbecomeac.

This adds to my proposal that
travel and trade bans be dropped,
so that we can meet the people
we have been told are our one-
mies.

From the above type of plat-
form, one can go to any length;
such as the destruction of all
nuclear weapons) to save Man
from himself.

I suggest that you consider the
above ideas, and then campaign
for the candidate who is willing
not only to stop war, but also
to befriend the people we have
called our "enemies."

This Is a big bill to fill, but if
we wait for the election in 1972
to start, our chances of com.
pleting anything like this will be
diminished by every advance
made in the various fields of mili.

analogy may Illustrate my con-
tention. When one is surrounded
by rattlesnakes, who have coiled
up In the position of attack, one
shoots before he waits for the
snakeblte.

Moshe Dayan, whom the Left
sees as another Hitler, executed
the only option he had. He hit the
adversary fast and hard (perhaps
the U.S. could learn a lesson to
utilize In Its Vietnam tactics),
and won a decisive victory in a
brief period of time, capturing
Arab lands, some of which in all
fairness belong to Israel.

Now the Arabs are crying for
the return of all confisoated ter-
ritory. Had the Arabs won the
war, l'm sure that the alterna-
tive of relinquishing lsrael to
Levi Eshkol’s government would
not cross King Nasser’s cran-
ium. But, of course, the weeping
and gnashing of teeth persists.

The Arabs still claim that Is-
rael ls rightfully theirs. The
country of Palestine, they state,
was snatched from them,render-
ing to Arabs a grave injustice.

To whom does the area mean
more, If that is at all relative?
Compared to the extensive tech-
nological progress made under
twenty years of Hebrew inhabi-
tance, the advancement of the
Arabs in what was Palestine
seems hopelessly insignificant.
The Jews have returned Israel to
a promised land through science
and industry. To them lsrael Is
a realization of centuries of faith
and trust.

Why anyone American can side
against justice and democracy ls
beyond my comprehension. How-
ever, the antics of today's ex.

treme left wing are often diffi-
cult to understand.

The Arabs also have logical
points, but none justify proposed
aggression and troop build-up on
Israel's borders. Perhaps the
principal reason 1 side with the
Israelis is the Communist ques.
tion. Wherever insurgencies and
war exist in the world of today,
some assemblage of the Commu-
nists seems to be responsible.

It was obvious that the Rus.
alone were striving for an Arab
victory. Although i realize that
the picture is never totally black
and white, I find that If one sides
against the Commles, he's mor-
ally right ninety-nine out of one
lmndred Instances. I'm convinc-

\ right in regard to Israel.
