athekeller

by Gary Cole

Sounds Unlimited, the third

group in the Coffee House ser-
ies, is by far the best group
sponsored by t: Campus Center
GoverniuBos .
r The Sounds Unlimited began
their performance with a bright
rendition of "Everything’s Com-
ing Up Roses." Their neat num-
ber, "You Were On My Mind,"
began softly and quietly and had
a strong Christy-Minstrel-like
end.

The up performed a series
of songsnrlrat they lumped under
the category “Oldies But Good-
ies." The numbers ranged from
“King of the Road” to the Mick-
ey Mouse Club theme. The three
performers, Erica Schmitz, Dick
Seale and Jon Adelson, demon-
strated a fine flair for light ly-
rics and comedy. In short, the
series of songs was very en-
tertaining.

Erica Schmits thenbegan"Try
To Remember” from “The Fan-
tasticks." When the entire group
sang, the number became the
haunting melody that it is.

After introducing the next song
as a South Carolina folk ballad,
Jon Adelson soloed with "Hava
Nagila." The song is ahandclap-
ping, toe tapping number which
Adelson performed to the utmost.

They ended the show with the
French and English versions of
"What Now My Love." The song
was particularly weak for a fin-
ale, and the group may have done
better by performing "Hava Na-
gila" for the show stopping end.

Sounds Unlimited performs
songs from every part of the mus-
ical world. They do Broadway
numbers, folk, rock and comedy
with ease and a certain mtural-
ness. They look like they are hav-
ing a great time while working,
and this feeling of enthusiasm is
transmitted to the audience.

Sounds Unlimited proves that
the Coffee House Circuit is cap-
able of bringing bright, new
groups to the University. Their
last performance is tomorrow
night —— don't miss it if at all
possible.

Last week, a friend of mine
came running into the room and
enthusiastically said, "Oh,
you’ve just got to listen to this
new album lbought. It's greatii"
Well, she was right.

The album is called "Wild-
flowers,” by Judy Collins. The
title is very apropos; she is
“turning time into flowers," and
the album is dedicated "for you
who've been traveling so long.”
The first song, "Michael From
Mountains," prepares the listen-
er for the sparkly, tingling im-
pression which is present
throughout the entire album. The
beauty of the selections comes
from the simple, lovely imagery
which Judy Collins uses. It is
precisely this simplicity which
accentuates the richness and
warmth of the music. You don't
find yourself lost in tiresome,
oppressive symbolism. One ex-
ample of this simplicity is “Sis-
ters of Mercy," which can mean
any kind of comfort that the its
tenors wants it to mean. I think
these sisters of Mercy are stars,
but the song renders any inter-
pretation valid. Another illustra-
tion of the beautiful imagery is
the lyrics of "Hey, That’s No
Way to Say Good-bye ’:

“Your hair upon the pillow
Like a sleepy golden storm"

All the songs have a certain
llditness of sound due to the
accompaiument of instruments
such as the flute, harp and

Reader’s Theatre Gives
Albert Camus Evening

A Reader's Theatre produc-
tion of "An Evening with Albert
Camus" will he presented in the
Assembly Hal.‘ of the Campus
Center at 8:15 p.m. on Friday
and Saturday nights, April 5 and
6.

Directed and edited by Law-
rence B. Rosenfeld of the Dept.
of Speech and Dramatic Art, the
"evening" will consist of two
readings. The first act will com-
prise Camus' “The Stranger,”
the second will consist of "The
Plague," again by Camus.

Rosenfeld stated tint he can.
densed both books for this rea-
der's theatre version with the
goal of retaining, clarifying, and
emphasising "Camus' philosophy
of the Absurd and his philosophy
of Royall."

R. Bruce Tiffany will play the
leading ciuracter of the first
book, “The stranger." This is
the doomed figure of the mur-

derer, Meurault. The main role

in "The Plague," the second
book, is that of Dr. Rieux. This
character will be portrayed by
Fred Penzel.

Rosenfeld said of these two
roles that “both men recognize
the Absurd." His version of the
first book will not, however, at-
tempt to answer the controver-
sial question (according to the
director) of whether Meurault
ever actively participates in the
"Revolt" against this condition
of absurdity.

Rosenfeld stated that "The
Plague" is an allegory on the
German occupation, though on
the larger scale the symbol “the
plague" is representstiveof war.
He added tint Dr. Rieux is in a
definite temperament of revolt
against the absurdity of warfare.

others in the cast of the pro-
duction are Allan Bennett, Ruth
Friedoer, Greg Thompson, Phil-
lip Kivg, the Davis, stratton

Rawson and m someones-r.

ceiesta, and of course the soft,
coaxing voice of Judy Collins
herself.

"Wildflowers" is a springy-
type album. Each song ends with
an optimistic outlook, which is
a welcome change from the cold
pessimism which pervades too
many albums. "BothSidesNow,"
although it begins with the dis-
illusionment of love and life,
resolves itself to a feeling of
hope:

“Love’s illusions I recall,

. . .But something's gained

in living every day.”

This same optimism is also
revealed in “Hey, That's No
Way To Say Goodbye":

"Now it’s come to distances,
And both of us must try.

Your eyes are soft with sorrow.
Hey, that’s no way to say
goodbye."

The themes of the selections
are not new—love, happiness,
a carefree spirit. Yet the ex-
pressiveness of the lyrics and
melodies make Judy Collin’s al-
bum as fresh as a spring wild-
flower.

“by Robert B. Cutty

i am beginning to feel more
like a feature reporter than an
arts critic. Certainly i can do
nothing more than desonbe the

' activities featured at the final

programs in the lNTERMEDlA
'68 series.

On Tuesday, Aldo Tambelltni
graced this campus with his new
art forms, “Black Media" and
“Electra-Media." a hope l’m
spelling these names correctly).
Basically, Tambellini, as an ar-
tist, works with electronics
equipment (as TV sets, Carousel
slide projectors, and movie pro-
jectors).

To create his “art works,"
Tambellini uses video-tape, pic-
ture slides, and film; all of
these, in their natural state, are
black in color; that is to say,
completely colorless.

On these media, Tambellini
creates his art. He uses light
to achieve certain oscillating ef-
fects, acid and white paint to
etch and paint various designs.

The audience that observed the
results of Tambellini’s en-
deavors was rather obviously
bored with the whole thing. All
they could observe were a lot
of lights, most of them being
shined in their eyes. Further,
the feedback from the TV sets
was bombarding them with a
great din of sonic noise.

Artistlcally, Tambellinl's ef-

forts were fairly interesting. ills
acid etchings had the nightmare
quality of agonized intestines.
But Tambellinl has no under-
standing of the theatrical limits.-
tions of film media: until he has
learned how to handle properly
the presentation of this form, he
will never succeed.

Of course, Allan Kaprow
whose happening was s
here last Friday in the podium
tunnels, had no problems at all
in entertaining his audience:they
were all helping him with his

IIIDPB s.

And what was Kaprow's ingen-
ious little stunt involved with?
Why it involved garbage, nap
turally. You see, in this happen-
ing (entitled “ Round Trip,” which
is a pun, as will be obvious
later), two groups of people roll
balls towards each other, each
group ending at the other’s be-
ginning point.

As these balls were rolled to-
wards each other, they grew in
size, forming alterally)from any
garbage found along the way (on
the sides of the tunnel, of course,
with additional contributions
from the janitorial staff).

1 am not trying to imply that
Kaprow’s happening was not en-
joyable, l merely believe that his
idea, ‘ Round Trip,” was utterly
pointless. One expected some-
thing with a little more imagin-
ation from "the father of happen-
ings.”

Midnight String Quartet

 

Reverie

by Walt Dolleriy

 

 

" Love Rhapsodies"by the Mid-
night String Quartet follows the
pattern established by the pre-
vious Quartet albums of "listen-
ing" arrangements of popular
tunes (as well as some others
dating back quite a while) per-
formed by three stringed instru-
ments and either a piano or harp-
sicord.

The arrangements on the whole
are pretty decent if not better.
They are always done tastefully
and never overdone. These are
for quiet listening pleasure.

The best songs on the album
are: “Impossible Dream" the
violins and the piano here give
just the right triumphant note
without getting carried away.
"Never My Love" —-the instru-
mentalization here is very good,
the song is played in a somewhat
lower key than the others giving
it more strength and the harpsi-
cord is used here with great
advantage—it contributes to the
mood beautifully. “Goin' out of
My Head"— this is fairly well
handled although it doesn't quite
match the other two tunes men-
tioned.

One thing about the album that
is not so the selection
of other songs. It sounds like
“Backgronnd Time at the Movie
malt” (which no one i know
could “entity. baseman

ment that it sounded like the
background music you hear at a
restaurant or in a movie), and
“Twilight Sonata." These are all
played well and are completely
in keeping with the mood that the
Quartet is striving for; it just
depends on your personal taste
in what songs you like to hear.

Fort Lauderdale Book..

If you already have one of the
Midnight String Quartet's albums
and you like it, you'll like this
one, too; if you like listening
and dancing music, try it, you’ll
probably enjoy it; if your taste
runs to folk or rock, forget it,
go get the new Cream album
(There's an experience).

Come On Down, Baby

by Charles Tollent

With the onset of spring, the
annual trek to Ft. Lauderdale is
on by thousands of vacationing
college students. The first ques-
tion asked by those students is
what’s going to happen down at
Lauderdsle. William Haines and
William Taggart seem to have
the answer in their new book
"What Happens in Fort Lauder-
dalo" published by Grovs Press.

The book complies supposedly
representative student descrip-
tions of what actually is taking
place in Lauderdale every March
and April. in the editor's words,
“This book does not aim to sit:
mulata the annual exodus to Ft.
Lauderdale but to reveal the
states 11 mind, the imdercurnnts
of feeling of today’ on

s liege
limitilfP-ﬂ .il.iiii'.-il.ild. W

aim of the book, it has failed
miserably.

The student stories range from
pornographic episodes to sicken-
ly melodramatic moral lessons
that one can’t help laughing at.
These stories are just isolated
episodes that could have happen-
ed in California, New York, or
any beach resort where students
gather for a good time. No socio-
logical trend is evident or for
that matter no worthwhile pur-
pose can be found at all.

if you’re planning to go to
Lauderdale this spring vacation
and first want to find out what
happens there, or if you're not
going down and want to find out
what you're missing, the book
won't enlighten you- you'll only
be angry at yoursell for wasting
nineteenth

Jazz Festival
Plans Announced

The University's second an-
nual Spring Jazz Festival has
become reality. Co-chairmen
Barry Schienberg and Ken Fisher
have planned the festival for
Thursday thru Saturday, May 2,
3 and 4.

Sponsored by the Special
Events Board, the festival will
begin Thursday night with the
Gary Burton Quartet ip an out-
door concert by the Campus Cen-
ter Garden area. Burton, on
vibes, is one of the jazz world's
newest and exciting artists.

Featured in concert on Fri-
day and Saturday nights will be
some of the top names in jazz.
Herbie Mann and his quintet,
Dizzy Gillespie, the Charles
Lloyd Quartet, and Clarke Ter-
ry's big band are set to head-
line these shows. Contrary to
what has previously been sche-
duled, the Louis Armstrong con-
cert will not be held.

Friday and Saturday night con-
certs will be held in the gym
in the Physical Education Build-
ing. Block seating arrangements
are presently being planned. Any
fraternity, sorority or Quad in-
terested in purchasing block
seats are urged to call 462-
1201. Schienberg and Fisher feel
that the festival will be one of
the only opportunities to expose
the student body and the entire
community to an array of jazz-
men of such high caliber. The
chairmen hope that the festival
will reach larger audiences than
last year's festival played to.

"The Graduate”

 

Films

by Dave Bordwell

 

 

I enjoyed Mike Nichols’ "The
Graduate" (Palace Theatre) but
I have doubts about how good it
is. Does it really break out of
the Hollywood stereotypes? For
a while it looks as if it might,
but inklings of a certain dis-
honesty are confirmed by an end-
ing that struggles not to be the
cop-out it finally is.

The graduate is Ben, an ami-
able, slmple fellow who returns
to his wealthy family "sorts dis-
turbed about things in general."
His parents and their friends
are stupid and unfeeling. Out of
loneliness he is drawn into an
affair with an older woman, the
main result of which is his fall-
ing in love with her daughter.
The girl finds out about the
affair and throws Ben over. He
follows her back to college and
makes some attempts at recon-
ciliation, but she abruptly leaves
to marry a slick Joe College
type. Ben pursues them, but ar-
rives just after the "I do’s"
have been said. Nonetheless, in
a really funny scene, hesnatches
the bride, fends off the assemb-
led families with a huge crucifix,
and the two leap onto a passing
bus. The end.

Now this film is easy to like.
First. the leadls played by Dustin
Hoffman, a pleasant young act )r
with something of the simple,
Sta-Prest good looks of Jack
Lemmon. Anne Bancroft gives us
a convincing manhungry matron.
Katharine Ross is adequate as
Elaine. The Simon & Garfunkel
soundtrack knits the narrative

together very well. The comedy
— and the film is at many
moments screamineg funny —
derives mainly from that under-
played deadpsn Nichols-May
style, paced to puncture contem-
porary banallties. The direction
is clever, (except for those ubi-
quitous telephotos), and some
times — as in the analogy be-
tween Ben's fishtank and his pa-
rents' swimming pool — truly
revealing.

Why, then, does the film fail
to satisfy? Partly, I think, be-
cause beneath the comedy-of-
manners surface there is not
enough sense _of real life. Why
doesn’t Ben have to worry about
the draft? why is there no men-
tion of the Vietnam war, or
psychedelics, or just some tangi-
ble economic facts? I'm not ask.
ing for another " Masculine Fem-
inine" (if I were, I wouldn't ask
Nichols), but it seems to me that
any account of contemporary
youth’s malaise must take these
things into account.

A more serious objection is
that the cards have been stacked
too neatly in Youth’s favor. Where
Godard is detached enough to re-
tain a sense of irony about his
young people, Nichols gives us
kids who shine like seraphlm
amid adults who are crass
phonics cruelly using the young
for gratification. The accuracy
of this portrait of the predatory
grownup is both the film’s prime
virtue — for it reproduces the
surface behavior brilliantly —
and its chief deficiency — for

 

The Yardhirds

“— Fourth Time Around

by Igor Koroluk

 

Last Thursday night at the

Aerodrome, the Yardbirds show.
ed why rock was revived in Eng-
land and why English groups
still dominate the creativity in
rock. When they took the stage,
they were music—no arrogance,
no hang ups they knew they were
performers; they knew what they
could do, and they gave it every-
thing. Tholr professionalism was
almost as impressive as their
obvious love for what they were
doing.
The Yardbirds, like so many
English groups, started as ablues
band. Of all those original groups
they were probably the most
traditional Chicago-blues orient-
ed, but gradually their sound de-
velopment into what was called
simply "electronic blues."

Probably the best example of
this sound can be found on their
“iiave‘up” album, notably in
“l'm A Man" and "Train Kept
A-Rollln.”

The group has withgone many
personal changes since their

founding but has managed to keep
their distinctive sound.

Watching them, I was immed-
iately impressed with their
absorption in their music and the
undated quality of their old songs.
When listening to old Yardbird
material, it becomes quite evi-
dent where much of the West
Coast Sound was derived—all the
basic elements are contained
right there.

The lead guitarist is fantastic.
He looks about nine feet tall and
one inch wide with an arm span
as long as his body. He coaxes,
teases, ridicules, and managed
to pull every sound possible for
his axe, and then he goes one up
and pulls out some unheard of
sounds by playing his guitar with
a bow. He's fantastic!

Unfortunately the performance
was marred by overly loud amps
which cut the vocals badly and
marred by a very audience.
There were only 300 people and
with a little simple arthmetic
it becomes apparent that some-

body lost. Hopefully, this will not
affect the Aerodrome's policy
of trying to get big name per-
sonalities, but you will have to
admit somebody is going to think
twice before booking a group as
famous and therefore as expen-
sive as the Yardbirds.

This weekend is bringing the
fantastic Jimi Hendrix Exper-
ience in concert in Troy and
the Ultimate Spinach back to the
Aerodrome.

The Spinach is a very talented
group, and it may prove worth
while seeing them. Their music
still lacks a distinctive sound
with which you could label the
group. It is more of a composite
Jefferson Airplane, Doors, and
Country Joe and the Fish with
a little advanced Blues Project
thrown in for good measure.
Nevertheless, their sound is
good, entertaining, and if they
don’t have any problems with
blown amps it may even prove
highly imaginative.~

we’re never given any sympathe-
tic insights into the adults' char-
acters. Like most indictments,
this states the case in blacks
and whites. showing no greys.

The ending bothers me most.
We want Ben to win Elaine andby
all the laws of Hollywood he
should; so when she's married,
Nichols seems to be tossing out
the cliches. But he cheats on
his story'the way Coppola did in
“ You're a Big Boy Now”(another
rites-depasssge story): by re-
sorting to Hollywood slapstick—
in that film a Keystone Kops
chase, in this a daring heroic
rescue. Both are smokescreen
tactics to divert us from watch.
ing a plotline falling to shreds.
Elaine behaves motivelessly
enough in getting married, but
when she suddenly runs off with
Ben, all character-logic evapor-
ates. The fake ambiguity of the
ending — the two of them on a
bus, headed for where ? — can-
not really pull thls inconsistency
off. Nichols might have better
lived up to the promise of the
story by having Ben win Elaine a
little less splashily, with more
relevance to adequate motivation.
But then perhaps the ending would
not be so conventional and safe,
Nichols would not be directing in
Hollywood, and “The Graduate"
would not be the box-office suc-
cess it is.

Tomorrow Night
In C.C. Ballroom

Tom Paxton, one of the most
prominent young singers and
composers on the current folk
scene, will be appearing here in
concert on Saturday, April 6,
under the auspices of the Fresh-
man class.

Two performances are sche-
duled here for 7:30 and 9:45,
both in the Campus Center Ball-

room. Tickets will be on sale '

Tuesday thrqu Friday at the
information Desk in the Campus
Center and will cost $1.50 with
student tax and $2.50 without.

Not strickly a “protestsinger,
Paxton follows more in the tradi-
tion of such geniuses of variety
as Woody Guthrie and the free-
wheeling Pete Seeger. The topics
covered by his music rangefrom
religion, love, and war to air
pollution, auto safety, and pop
art.

He has recorded four albums
on the Elektra label which re-
present a wide cross-section of
the many modes of musical ex-
pression which he has mastered.

Among his most well-known
compositions are “Ramblin'
Boy," the lovely ballad popular-
ized the world over by Pete
Seeger, "Bottle of Wine,” and
the now famous anti-Vietnam pro-
test, "Lyndon Johnson Told the
Nation."

Paxton has ind great success
as a performer both here and
abroad. He has appeared at Car-
negie, Philharmonic, and Town
Halls in New York, and has play-
ed to a sell-out crowd of seven
thousand at London's Albert Hall.

On stage, Tom Paxton exhibits
wit, verve, and a fine sense of
the sardonic. His easy manner
and sense of humor make his

audience im mediately at ease and .

receptive to his music.

Concert Band
Expands In Size

Within the past few years the
University Concert Bandhsspar-
alleled the expansion of the Uni-
versity in both si and quality.
The band now boasts a comple-
ment of over seventy students
and performs works of the high-
est difficulty, including com-
positions written expressly for

Aided by the recent growth of
the music department, the con-
cert band now finds itself in a
most advantageous position. Fa»
culty members are available for
private lessons as well as for
coaching small ensembles.

Six of the band members are
music majors, while the other
students are mostly performers
who have played first chair in
high school. Thus the caliber
of the musicianship has increas-
ed greatly within even one year.

Mr. William Hudson, director
of the University Concert Band,
has scheduled sectional rehear-
sals in addition to the two ninety
minute meetings during the week.
The results of this practice will
be exhibited in the most exten-
sive series of band concerts.
Encouraged by a very success-
ful trip to Expo 67 in Montreal,
the band has scheduled perfor-
mances this semester inCortland
and Ossining.
