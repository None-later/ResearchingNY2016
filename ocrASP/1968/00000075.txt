Mike Nolan and Frank Meters
looked very good in the 440while
Tom Sears is doing well in the
high jump. Pat Gepfert end

coach Munsey feels he is fairly
pleased with the time trials and
that the teem is doing very well.

Swim Meet

The first AMIA swim meet got
under way on Monday, with the
holding of trials in two events,
the 100 yard breaststroke and
the 100 yard freestyle. The turn-
out for the trials was somewhat
less than had been anticipated,
as only the State University Swim
Club, APA, 8TB, and UFS, had
teem entries. Therefore the 100

were the only events with more

Four Lettermen Returning
To Bolster Tennis Squad I

This year s Tennis team, coachedby Merlin Hathaway, revolves around a nucleus
of four returning Iettermen. Although the team lost two of its outstanding performers
when Ken Zacharias and George Nicosia graduated, coach Hathaway is hoping that
his men will beable to move upa step in competition and meet the challenge satisfactorily.

In addition to this four
lettermen, coach Hathaway
is counting on the develop-
ment of a couple of sopho-
mores who have moved up
from last year’s freshmen
team to compete on the
varsity level.

Brian McDermott, Tom Wolen-
clk, Marty Bergen and Darrel
Ksrp are the four lettermen on
whom coach Hathaan is basing
his hopes for a. winning season.

McDermott, last year's num-
ber two man is probably the
strongest candidate on this year's
team. He will be in the first
spot for the squad this year
and will therefore be facing
tougher competition than was the
case last year. Hathaway, how-
ever, commented that he expects
Brian to be much improved over
last year as he spent much of
the summer competing in tourna-
ments in the area.

Coach Hathaway also stated
that the play of Tom Wolenclk
has greatly improved. Con-
sequently, he expects that Tom
will be a valuable asset to the
team's success in this year's
competition.

The mentor of the team, how-
ever, was disappointed with
Marty Bergen and Darrel Karp
as they both reported out of play-
ing shape. The success of the
team depends to a large extent
on whether or not these two can
get into shape before the season
opener.

lra Outstatcher and Jeff
Faulkner were mentioned as two
sophomores who could contribute
to the success of the team. In
addition, Dennis o'bsary, 11 jun-
ior who did not compete in his

 

games before the next issue at the ASP.

Baseball Squad Faced

first two years was cited as a
possible starter for this year’s
squad.

Mr. Hathaway commented that
his team will be at a disadvan-
tags as a result of the way that
spring recess is scheduled. He
related that many of the teams
which Albany will be competing
against will have already parti-
cipated in most of their schedule
before Albany plays them.

a ten-game schedule this year,

With Heavy Schedule

by Jim Winslow

Having to contend with a fluke
in scheduling, Albany State's var-
sity baseball team will initiate
its season with eight games in
ten days. To makematters worse
all eight games will be played
during SUNY at Albany’s spring
recess!

Coach Burlingame's eighteen
game schedule begins with what
he termed "probably our toughest
competition," the University of
Illridgeport on Thursday, April

1.

Oswego, reigning champion of
the state school loop and a team
which Albany has never beaten,
will play the Danes on Saturday,
April 20, in a doubleheader be-
ginning at one o'clock. All home
games will be played at the new
campus atheltic field.

“I can't emphasize enough the
fact that those first eight games
are cmciel,” Burlingame said.
“We would like to see as many
area students as possible at the
games during the vacation,” he
emphasized.

“We have s toun schedule but
I believe we have the talent to
meet the challenge presented,"
he continued.

The probable starting lineup
shows Jim Murley, the center-
fielder, leading off. Second base-
men Paul Monettiwillbatsecond
but is being crowded by soph
Tom Decker. Junior first base-
men Jack Sinnott will bat third
and shortstop Denny Elkin will
hold down the cleanup spot.

Soph catcher Jim Sandy will
most probably bet fifth. Two
transfers will hold down the next
two spots. Jim Rourke, a junior
transfer from Delhi, will hold
the left field spot and bat sixth.
Junior Joe St. Onge, a transfer
from Hudson Valley Community,
will follow and play third base.
Joe is a shortstop by trade but
has shown great promise as a
third seeker.

Looking at the pitching, the
Danes are deep in experience.
Righthenders Ces Galka, George
Webb, and Tom Eglsston will
carry most of the pitching load
as starters. Coach Burlingame
considers senior Tom Piotrow-
ski his best firemen and has
high hopes for lefty Rich Patrol.
Roaming out his corpsof mounds-
men are sophomores Dick Spiers
