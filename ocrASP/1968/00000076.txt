Albany State’s spring sports schedule this year is
really quite impressive. The baseball team is faced with
a tough eighteen game schedule, but Coach Burlingame's
crew promises to be one of the most successful nines
in recent years. Thirdbaseman Andy Christianwss the
only starter to graduate, and last year's freshmen in-
clude some fine prospects. With a seven man pitching
staff of Tom Egelston, Cas Galka, George Webb, Rich
Patrei, TomPiotrowski, and sophomores Rich Barde-
schewski, and Rich Spiers, Burlingame has by far the
deepest pitching staff in quite some time.

Hitting was the team’s major weakness last year, but
this department will, hopefully, be improved consider-
ably, by the further development of the returnees, and
by the addition of sophomores Jim Sandy, Tom Decker.
and Steve Flood. Jack Sinnott, last year's leading hit-
ter, returns, as do Denny Elkin, George Webb, Jim Mur-
ley and Paul Leonetti.

The prospects for golf and tennis, the other two var-
sity level sports, are some what uncertain. The golf
team has a fine four man nucleus returning. Craig Luth-
or, Brian Hill, Ray McCloat, and Bill Prendergast are
all experienced golfers, but after them the team is
lacking in experience and depth. The tennis team has
top returnees in Ron McDermott, and Marty Bergan,
but the team is pretty thin overall.

Besides these sports, Albany State will also be com-
peting in three club sports, two of which are entirely
new, and one of which is in its second year. The track
and field club, under the direction of coaches R. Keith
Munsey and Brian Kelly, is an expansion of last year's
track club. Due to a years head start, and some fine
cross country runners, it looks like the club will be
strongest in the track events. The 880, the mile and the
two-mile look especially strong, with cross-country run-
ners like the Myers brothers, Mike Attwell, Larry Fred-
erick, and Paul Roy leading the way and once againBasil
Morgan should be outstanding in the sprints. Most of
the field events are still unsettled, but it looks like the
broad jump, and the javelin may be strong points.

Of the two new sports, lacrosse and sailing, lacrosse
probably has the greater appeal. A fast moving and rug-
ged sport, lacrosse is an ideal spectator sport, that is
from the spectator's point of view similar to ice
hockey. Coach Joseph Silvey is quite optimistic about the
coming season, despite the fact that this is a first year
team sport. He seems to feel that the team is capable
of turning in an excellent season. The Sailing club only
started practice this last weekend, and sailing is a sport
that takes a lot of know-how and teamwork, but the team
is boldly moving into competition with some excellent
schools, and by the end of the season it should be able
to make a good showing.

One major problem that will arise, in regard to
reporting spring sports is the schedule. For three weeks
now there have been no varsity sports events to report,
however between now and the next issue of the ASP,
which will be May 3, the varsity tennis team will play
half its schedule, and baseball and golf will have com-
pleted most of their schedules. This unfortunate develop-
ment is a result of a last minute change in the spring
recess which resulted in a host of athletic contests
being scheduled for times when there will be no one
here to watch. Thus there is little we will be able to do
but pick up the respective teams at the half-way point,
and follow them from there.

r’sCup

With Denny Elkin tossing in 18
and Bill Moon 11, APA trolled
to a decisive 44-35 win in the
finals of the Commissioner's Cup
Tournament last Tuesday.

The game was acomplete re-
versal of the League I champion-
ship game which Potter Won 44-
28. APA played a harassing man
to man defense, and on offense,
moved the ball slowly and de-
liberately, waiting for good shots.

This stategy paid off, as APA
jumped into an early lead, and
maintained a 5-9 point lead
throughout the first half. Elkin
had ten and Moon 7 as APA
led 23-14 at intermission.

Potter closed the gap to three
early in the second half, Elkin’s
quick baskets gave APA acom-
fortable lead that they held the
rest of the way. George Webb
led Potter with 13, while Gary
Torino turned in a fine defensive
effort for APA.

In the consolation game Potter
11 gained an early lead and main-
tained it throughout for a 40-
40 win. Potter used its bench
to full advantage, running subs
in and out, and wearing down
their opposition. Ken Wilkes led
Potter with 15, while Dave
Wheeler was high man for the
Barons with 12.

APA In Finals Easily

In order to reach the finals
APA has to get past the Fly-
ing Jabones, the League 1V
champs, and Potter 11, who had
surprised KB 1 in the first round
of the tourney. Rich Spiers dump-
ed in 21 and Bill Moon contri-
buted 10 in APA’s 64-26 winover
the Flying Js, who simply did
not have the fire power to handle
a League team. ,

in the Albany A team's game,
the start was slow and sluggish
as neither team could generate
much of a offense. Albany mov-
ed to a brief five point lead, but
Siena came back to tie at the
halftime mark 24-24. Albany's
scoring was well spread, as Ed
Cole led with 5.

The second half was adifferent
story entirely, as both teams got
hot, and shooting duel developed
between Albany's Ray McCloat
and Denny Elkin, and Siena's
Hank Debbin and Joe Mullin. The
lead switched back and forth
early in the half, but about mid-
way through the half McCloat
hit two quick jumpers and then
fed Elkin on a fast break and
Albany led by six.

For the remainder of the game
Stone was forced to play desper-
ate catch-upbasketball. With Deb-
bin leading the way Siena did cut
the gap to two with less than a
minute left, but Gary Torino hit
two clutch foul shots to up the
lead to four. siena closed to two
again, and then regained control
with seven seconds left, buttheir
last desperation shot was off the
mark.

Leading scorers for Albany
were McCioat with 15, ll ofthem

early lead on the shooting ofJack
Sinnott and George Webb, but
their shooting cooled off late in
the half and RPl's Chi Phi team
came on strong to edge ahead
32-3l at the half.

In the second half Chi Phi
jumped into an early lead and
held on to a lead of a least four
throughtout. Pat Reed’s aggres-
sive board work kept the Albany
squad in contention, but Chi Phl’s
organization and shooting simply
proved to be too much.

Jack Sinnott led the scoring for
Albany, dumping in 15, while
Reed hit 12 of his 13 in the sec-
ond half, mainly on short jump-
ers after offensive rebounds.

Chris Lynch was high for RPl,
as he tossed in 22 mostly on out-
side jumpers.

In both games Albany was play-
ing against teams that had
played together all year, and al-
though both Albany Teams work-
ed the bali reasonably well, they
lacked the cohesion that comes
from playing together all year.

Spiers had 15, Moon 12,
Jack Sinnott 11 in leading APA’s

tossing in 25, mostly on outside
jumpers.

Potter reached the finals by
outscoring Potter at 51-27, and
the Barons 49-47. Ray McClo'at
hit ' 16, George Webb 12, and
John Soja l0 in the Club’s easy
win over their League 111 team.
Jerry Leggieri hit 10 for the
losers.

The Potter-Barons game on
Sunday was a real cliff-hanger.
The Barons jumped into an early
first half lead, but Potter came
back strong totie 22-22 at inter-
mission. In the second half EEP
started to control the boards and
moved out in front, but the Bar-
ons fought back and were only
down by two with five seconds
left, but Terry Baxter’s jump
shot at the Buzzer was short.
Baxter led the Barons with 20,

Residences Office
Change Plans
After Protests

After receiving mass com-
plaints from the student body
over the two new proposed meal
plans, the Office of Residences
has announced a new food plan.
Aside from individualstudents,
the residence office received
complaints from LAAC and Can-
trai Council.

The new proposed plan will be
brought before these two student
bodies this week for consider-
ation. At these times students
will be able to make any
recommendations concerning the
plan. LAAC meets tomorrow
night; Central Council will meet
Thursday evening.

Under the now plan all under-
graduate resident students must
contract for board. The present
waiver of board policy for
dietary, religous and work con-
flicts will continue.

It is planned that the Food
Service Department will prepare
20 meals, breakfast, lunch and
dinner Monday through Saturday
and breakfast and noon dinner on
Sunday.

Each student Inust contractior
14 of the 20 meals per week
at a cost of $280. The student
may select any combination of
meals to equal 14 meals per week.

Since tho meal choices are
open the Office of Residences
anticipates the missed meal
factor would be eliminated. The
cost of the meal plan may be a
few dollars more or less than is
expected, and the price of food
for second semester next year
will be adjusted, if there is the
need.

The general increase in price
of meals is due to two main
reasons. First, there has been
a twenty dollar increase caused
by the rising cost of living.
Second, since this new plan will

Council Sends Mishkin
To Attempt Change Of

by Vic Looper

Central Council passednstate-
ment expressing Its strong (lis-
nppl‘ovai with the Food Plan and
empowered the President, Jeff
Mishkin, to express Council’s
opinion to Dr. Clifton C, Thorne,
at its Thursday, April 4 meeting,

Two plans offered to the stu-
dent wero: a 14 meal plan con-
sisting of breakfast, lunch and
dinner Monday - Thursday and
breakfast and lunch on Friday
and a 20 moalplan with break-
fast, lunch and dinner Monday-
Saturday and breakfast and dinner
on Sunday.

Students on the Food Commit-
tee were told that if they were
given too many choices the board
cost would be increased by a
large amount.

Puul Breslin, a member of
the Food Committee and LAAC
said that Food Service felt that
if they gave too many options
that they would lose money, es-
pecially the option of room and
board,

its stated that under the
three meal plan the cost would
be almoat the same as the two
meal plan due to the missed meal
factor.

Duncan Nixon felt that ques-

tion six of the LAAC Food Poll
of last December which 85 per
cent of the students wanted should
have been included in the plan.
This would have allowed the stu-
dent hls choice of 14 meals.

Breslin replied by stating that
this plan could be easily casted
wrong, would take two months 10
gel the trend, and due to the
missed meal factor would cost
almost as much as the three-
menl :1 day plan,

Neil Brown, director of Stu-
dent Activities and the Campus
Center, stated that it was always
his opinion that it was never
too late to appeal to the presi-
dent.

Mishkln was directed to speak
to Thorns about a lO-meal plan
which would be lunclHiinner,
Monday-Friday.

Council passed a resolution
20-0-2 requesting that appropri-
ate state administration and-or
state legislative action be taken
to allow the students of each unit
of the State University system
to determine a system of man-
datory student assessment fees.

As stated In the resolution
the present system of voluntary
student assessment fee is sub-
ject to large scale confusion and
