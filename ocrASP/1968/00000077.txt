‘King Vigils Held

In Academy Park,
University Gym
(Continued frOm Page 1)

The small gathering, number-
ing at times irom 20 to 50 peo-
ple, stood silently in Academy
Park, across irom the State
Capitol Building.

Some were holding posters ad-
vocating an end to violence in '
memory of the late Dr. King,
while others were holding
posters of a more militant type.

Those present Friday alter-
noon participated in a'typo oi
portest march to the arrest of
William Gibson, a member oi
the Brothers.

The march started at County
Court House, where Gibson was
arraigned and bail set for dis-
orderly conduct and resistance
to arrest, and proceeded to the
Second Precinct Police Station.

A law oi the members oi the
Brothers then asked if there was
suiiicient support for a sit-in pro-
testing what they termed the "un-
just arrest" of Bill Gibson.

The consensus oi those at-
tending the vigil was that there
was no desire to participate in
this, so the most oi the stu-
dents returned to the park.

Later in the alternoon,porsons
present sang a few social pro-
test songs such as Dylan's "Blow-
ing in the Winds". The re-
action oi townspeople to the Vigil
was characterized by acquiscence,

ment advocating that President

President Johnson: This act, "achieved nothing by lawlessness."
Now Is a time ior"joinihg and working together" so that we may
"move toward equality for all people." '

Vice President Humphrey: Slich an act, "brings shame to this
nation. it will give greater strength to the cause ior which he

iought."

Joseph Cohan (Chairman, NAACP, Albany): "Every man, woman

and ch

ld ought to "stop and think and resolve that their prejudi-

cial practices, which have been going on ior many years, he stop-
ped. Hatred will produce nothing but hatred."

Gov. Rockefeller: Dr. Martin Luther King "gave his llie in the
courageous fight ior fundamental values oi all humans.”

Gov. Reagan: “This "act of violence solved none oi our prob-
lems." He urged Caliiornia to remain calm.

FITE, Rochester: This "is indicative oi the evil which exists

not only in the south.”

Dr. King‘s philosophy proiessor from Boston University: "No

might take his lite."

Mayor Lindsay spent the day in Harlem seeking to lend a calm-

ing influence.

Martin Luther King: it is how well you live that is important,
not the longevity of life (accepting the Nobel Prize): in honoring
me, "you honor the struggle against man's inhumanity to man.
Genuine brotherhood and peace are more precious than diamonds,
or silver or gold. l have a dream," that one day, "Black and

DeadNegro Leader
Extoled By Collins

At the uptown vigil in mem-
ory oi the murdered Martin Luth-
er King Jr. President Evan R.
Collins delivered an address that
compared the characteristics at
the University Community to the
ideals of King. The following
are excerpts from the pres-
ident’s speech the day after the
assassination.

“As a University Community,
we are a community of youth,
identifying with the qualities of
youth which will characterize
King —— the belief that things
could be better, and an insis-
tence on making them so; vigor,
ﬂexibility, tough resistance, im-
patient wlth things he considered
to be wrong, and a desire to
change them, now.

“A second characteristic of
the University Community is its
dedication to reason, and to the

the meeting oi the Faculty Sen-
ate.
After discussing procedures
oi Faculty Senate ior several
minutes, Collins extended his
personal invitation to the gen-
tlemen to attend.

With a law minutes remain-
ing, the discussion took aquick
change to the topic of hextyear's
meal plans.

President Collins assured the
students that the plans were not
yet concrete and that they could
be changed.

exercise of the intelligence. To
us, it is important that King
was a thoughtful man, a man oi
real learning, an informed stu-
dent as well as an agent oi
change. . .

"He led the common people;
his road lay where people liv-
ed and worked; his hand was
outstretched in service. His mes-
sage was familiar, but he lived
it; his courageous insistence on
true racial equality; the convic-
tion that every man merits not
alone the right to make a liv-
ing but also to lead a life oi
dignity and peace.

"And .the triumph of unrest-
son and aenselessness over his
person does not shake the Uni-
versity Community’s convic-
tions about ancredness oi the
human individual."

President Collins continued to
say, "We have three possible
choices (oi goals). One possible
choice is to give up, to make no
choice . . .

"Some will take the second
choice, the easy choice, the way
oi violence or brutality, oi child-
ish, primitive unreasoh, oi savag-
ery in one iorm or another,emo-
tional or physical.

"Or we can take the hard
choice that Martin Luther King
personified. This is the choice of
patience with iirmness, of non—
violence combined with uhswerv-
ing purpose. This is the pride
in strength so real that there
is no need to brag or swagger.

"This is the choice oi Martin
Luther King’s unwavering de-
votion to ideals, and his insis-
tence on achieving them."

At this point the member of
the Black Students organization
stormed out oi the Patroon
Lounge spitting out the word
"Hypocricy."

Collins cleared the air by say-
ing, “Obviously the gentleman
misinterpreted what i said." He
went on to say that beiore he
made a decision which would in-
volve the faculty and the student
body, he wanted to get the gen-
eral concensus oi the groups.

"it is only when those in-
volved are consulted that this
day can be one of signiiicant
meaning to the University com-
munity."

Students To Conduct Survey;

Students have met to explore
a program pairingunlversity stu-
dents with Albahy residents to
conduct a housing survey in Al.
bany's South End and Arbor Hill
districts.

Harry Hamilton spoke to the

Black Eye
To DiscussLiving
In ResidenceHaIIs

The men at Stuyvesant Tow-
er will preseht the iinai Black
Eye of the semester on Wednes-
day, May 1, at 7 p.m. in the
16th floor lounge oi the tower.

Starting with the topic "Co-
habitation — Now” the group
will proceed to discuss the var-
ious forms and ramiiications oi
this type oi resident living and
whether it would be advisable
for the university to experiment
in this area. One iorm oi co-
habitation to be explored will
be that outlined in Rimmer's
"The Harrad Experiment."

Although various students,iac-
ulty, and administration have al-
ready been lhvlted, the Black
Eye cordially extends an invi-
tation to the university commu-
nity at large.

The Black Eye philosophy is
that unstructered dialogue will
give everyone an opportunity to
express his views on the topic.
To encourage this the faculty
is asked to make no special ad-
vance preparation and do not
give a iormal presentation. To
further encourage an iniormal
attitude, refreshments are serv-
ed during the discussion.

group about how the program
was to be implemented and what
its purpose was.

"Minorities," he said, "don't
have access to the same houses
which the people who lived in
them beiore (and have moved
upward and out oi their old
neighborhood) had access to. Al-
bahy's housing code is good, but
not eniorced." in addition to this
there are no houses being built.

Survey iniormation will re-
veal answers to such questions
as Where are the good houses?
Where are the bad and de-
cayed houses? How much money
does one need to live in the bet-
ter areas? What people want
something diiierent, and what
do they want?

The Urban Center Orientation
program will provide the ques-
tionnaire in addition to a brief-
ing on what to look ior when a
surveyor enters the home be-
ing "inspected" and how to ob-
tain the correct iniormation.

Students and residents will re-
ceive iniormation irom the Ur-
ban Center during the orienta-
tion classes as to how those sur-
veyed may get Information about
jobs and job training.

“As people from the white
middle class go down to the in-
ner city," said Hamilton, "they
will talk with and meet people
they have not come in contact
with beiore."

in addition to obtaining mean-
ingful and vital iniormation, this
(project) will help to eliminate
some oi the problems, prev-
alent today. "You will be giv-
ing and getting information."
