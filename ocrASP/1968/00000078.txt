crest ., Budget

Of: Maryland State Colleges

(CPS) —- Student leaders from
10' Maryland state colleges and
universities are organizing a
state wide protest against the
governor’s "austerity". budget
for higher education, and against
his shut-down of Bowie State Col-
lege in Bowie, Maryland.

About 60 delegates, most of
them members of their respec-
tive student governments,attend-
ed the planning session at the Un-
iversity of Maryland's campus.

Although the meeting was or-
iginally called to consider what
students could do to protest Gov-
ernor Spiro T. Agnew's "aus-
terity" budget, the delegates
agreed that they-should protest
his closing of Bowie State as well.

Agnew ordered the small pre-

dominantly black school shut . 5

down after more’than 200 of its
students held a sit-in at the Mary-
land State House to dramatize
their appeal for more state aid.

The governor ordered all the
protesters arrested, and an-
nounced that Bowie State should

Of Any 14 Out Of 20Meals A Week

(Continued from Page 1)
decrease the number of missed
meals considerably, more food
will be consumed by the students
than under the present 14 meal
plan.

Under this new plan students
will be allowed to eat in any
contracted dinning room. That
is when using the meal plan the
student will be permitted to eat
at any quadrangle but not at the
Campus Center.

A contract meal card will be
issued on a monthly basis and
will entitle the student to '70 per
cent (14 of 20) of the meals pro-
vided for that month. For ex-
ample, 43 meals will be served
in the month of September. The
student is entitled to 30 meals.

Each time a student eats a
meal in a contract dining room,
one of the 30 numbers will be
punched. If a meal card is lost
it will not be replaced. if a
card is damaged, it will be re-
placed upon the surrender of the
damaged card.

Commuter and off-campus stu-
dents may purchase at a pro-rated
charge the meal ticket upon
presentation of their ID card.

Tickets may be purchased from
the FSA Contract Office,
Information Desk, Campus Cen-
ter. The pro-rated meal ticket
for September will cost $36.50
and for October, $75.75.

The new meal plan also in-
cludes guest meal rates for the
four meals served by Food Ser-
vice. They are as follows: Regu-
lar Breakfast, 85 cents; lunch
$1.10; dinner, $1.75.

A kosher meal option is avail-
able at an increased cost of
$70.00 frozen dinners, labeled
with the "0"-"U" symbol,signi-
fying certification as kosher,will
be served when standard meals
are served.

These kosher dinners willcon-
sist of the entree only. As wide
variety of food as is available
for purchase will be offered.
Students participating Inthis plan
will be offered the regular salad,
beverage and desert on the menu.

Since the plan will not be made
official (assuming no major ob-
jections by the student body) no
earlier than Friday, students are
asked not to select a meal plan
on their housing cards.

When rooms are picked by the
students they will be able to break
their housing contract if they do
not wish to participate in the new
meal plan.

Room and board costs will, as
in the other proposed plans, be
listed separately on the bill and
in official publications.

be_closed down until after its Eas-
ter break, on April 16. He has
since authorized $355,000 in ad-
ditional ‘funds for the school, how-
ever, and has agreed to meet
with the president of its student
government.

The Maryland student leaders
have not decided What form their
budget protest should take, al-
though a one-day strike is being
considered.

According to Jerry Fleischer,
treasurer of the student govern-
ment at the University of Mary-
land's College Park Campus, the
delegates. to the meeting decided
that’.if a. One day protest has no

‘ effect on the governor they will

organize a longer-term action.

One suggestion was that this fol.
low-up action should take the
form of an "indefinite" boycott
of classes.

The delegates agreed that the
protest should be aimed at get-
ting substantial increases in next
year's budget rather than at try.
ing to get additional funds this
year.

They were reminded, though,
that Agnew had made substantial
cuts in the budget requests from
the state's schools this year. One
example cited was that of the Uni-
versity of Maryland system,
whose request for a $9 million
budget increase was cut back to
$3 million.

Mark 0. Hatfield Is the Republi-
can Senator of Oregon. He was
elected to the United States Senate
in 1966 following a remarkably
successful political career in
Oregon politics. What set apart
this election for the Senatorship
of Oregon was Hatfield's sur-
prising move of making Vietnam
a major campaign issue. This
could very easily have put Hat-
field probable victory into
danger. Despite this Hatfield was
fairly well sasured of a victory
due to his fine record In Oregon.
Upon his entering politics Hat-
field was elected as a State Re-
presentative.

He followed this initial victory
by being elected to, the State
Senate, the Secretaryship ofState
in Oregon, and two successful
terms as Governor of his state.
Mark Hatfield had also enjoyed
a successful life before his enter-

ing politics. He received his B.A.
at the Oregon college of Willa-
mette in 1943. His education was
then interrupted while Hatfield
served during World War if. He
finally received his Masters in
1948 from Stanford University.
Hatfield then became an associa-
tive professor of political science
and dean at his alma mater of
Willamette College.

Mark Hatfield is considered
one of the promising young re-
publicans many people feel are
necessary to revitalize the party.
He is one of the new republicans
whose views seem almost indis-
tinguishable from those of his
democratic liberal counterparts.
He has long been considered the

LYNDON B. JOHNSON

Kennedy Gives Vietnam, Urban Solutions

Robert F. Kennedy, United
States Senator from New York,
for three years served President
Kennedy as both Attorney-
General and his closest adviser.
Since January 1065 as the junior
senator from the state of New
York he has initiated and sup.
ported programs that have bene-
fited every section of the state.

On the Issues that confront
us in crisis year —— 1968, Ken-
nedy has often spoken out.lie has
been for the past three years
at vocal critic of our Vietnam
policy. "What we must seek at
any negotiations isthe self-deter.
minatlon of the people ofVietnam
——including not only the present
government, but also those many
Vietnamese, Communist and non-
Communist, who are not now re-
presented in it. Only when all
political elements in Vietnam are
able to peacefully seek nature of
power and responsibility, pre-
ferably through free elections,
will there be peace in Vietnam."

Robert Kennedy has called,
time and again, for a complete
reappraisal of our foreign policy.
He has made it clear that he
does not accept the John Foster
Dulles concept of international
politics.

As Attorney-General and today
as candidate for President, Ken-v
nedy gives the black community
hope for change: "Negro Ameri-
cans have been told to cast down
their buckets for work. But even
now, in the midst of the longest
period of sustained expansion in
our history.Negro unemployment
continues at over twice the white
rate. Negro Americans have been
told to cast down their buckets
for an education, but equal edu.
cations have not been allowed
them.

Let us stop thinking of the
people of Harlem as liabilities,
idle hands for whom some sort
of occupation must be foundv Let
us think of them instead as valu-
able citizens, as people whose

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

Fred Haletead, Socialist Work-
ers Party Candidate for the Pre-
sidency, has certainly pulled no
punches about what he stands for.
He is as he states, "the only
candidate who calls for Immedi-
ate withdrawal of U.S. troops
from the Vietnam war and offers
a socialist alternative to this
capitalist system which breeds
war and racism."

He and his Vice-Presidential
running mate Paul Boutelle urge
tint instead of voting for one of
the choices under the "Priorities
in urban spending" question, stu-
dents write-in ublack control of
the black community" on this
portion of the ballot.

0n the issues before the elec-
torate today, Halstead has said,

no Vietnam war. Hatfield's views
are not limited to criticism of
Vietnam. He has also proposed
definite plans for Vietnam. This
plan would take part in three
parts: First, substitute Asian
troops for Americans; second,
create a Southeast Asian common
market; third, call an all-Asian
conference to end the war with
China included. He has further
gone on to state that he would
not support someone for the pre-
sidency who was opposed to find-
ing a peaceful solution tothe war.

Although Hatfield is known for
his outspoken views on Vietnam
this does not mean that he has
some very definite opinions on
other issues of importance in
this country. As with his Viet—
nam views Mark Hatfield is very
liberal on his stands with domes-
tic topics.

Lyndon B. Johnson, President
of the United States, and respon-
sible for both foreign and domes-
tic policy, began his residencein
the White House with the death
of John F. Kennedy on November
22, 1963. The former Senate
Whip, was re-elected by a land-
slide in 1964 when he swamped
former Senator Barry Goldwater,
the ultra-conservative Republi-
can candidate. Though ellgible for
re-election to anotherterm under
the constitution, he has declared
that he does not seek nor will he
accept the nomination ofhis party
for the Presidency.

On the major issues presently
before the electorate, President
Johnson has spoken often in de-
fense of his administration.Most
recently on Vietnam he announc-
ed what he calls "a unilateral step
toward deescalation.” He has in-
dicated his plans to halt all U.S.
aerial and naval bombardment

work can make a significant con-
tribution to themselves, their
families and the nailon."Senator
Kennedy sees the riots as "not
simply an aimless burst of
savagery nor the product of out-
side agitators. It is brutal evi-
dence of our failure to deal with
the crisis in urban America ——
and of our failure to bridge the
widening gap between the afﬂuent
and poor, black and whiteAmerl.

 Halét‘ead: withdrawal, Black Rights

"The Vietnam war, is one of the
most unjust and brutal wars in
world ,history. it is not in the
interests of the American people
whose sons, husbands and friends
are dying on the battlefields in
increasing numbers; and it is
more certainly not in the in.
terests of the Vietnamese people
who have been bombed, burned,
tortured and starved by the
hellish destruction of the U.S.
military machine.

u0f the announced or prospec-
tive candidates for President in
the 1968 elections, only Paul
Bouteile and myself are for the
immediate withdrawal of Ameri-
can military forces from Viet-
nam -— and from every other
country in the World. The Viet-

 

  

Poge 5 '-

aameae people have the element-
ary democratic right to deter-
mine their own affairs and the
U.S. has absolutely no rights to
be in Vietnam."

"We believe with millions of
Americans that the only effective
and just way to end the slaughter
of both Vietnamese and Ameri-
cans is to bring the Gls home
now. We are thereby the only
candidates who genuinely support
the welfare of the Oil themselves.

"At home we stand unequi-
vocally on the side ofblack people
in their struggle for jobs, better
living conditions and the right to
control their own communities
and call uponthe Americanpeople
to defend all black victims of of.
ficial and unofficial racist
attacks."

bombing in only that portion of
the country adjacent to the de-

ordered only l3,500 more men

also indicated the movement to

from the blight of obsolescence
and despair. . . there is no time
to lose."

He proposed active involve-
ment of private enterprise in a
ten-year effort to thwart the urban
problem. Johnson went on to
advocate the construction of 26
million new homes, 6 milliontobe
paid for by the federal govern-
ment. His spending schedule for
the project for fiscal year 1069
includes $4,580,000,000; $2,180,-
000,000, war on poverty; $750
million, urban renewal; 190 mil-
lion, mass transit; $20 million,
to foster research into promis-
ing urban innovations; and $1
billion for experimental model-
city projects which had provided
"the tools to carry forward the
nation's first comprehensive,
concentrated attack on neighbor-
hood decay."
