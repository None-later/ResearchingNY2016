McCarthy: Dem. Dove, Rights Advocate

Victorious in the New Hamp
shire primary and projected to
have at least 68 sure votes at
the Democratic National Conven-
tion in Chicago, Senator Eugene
McCarthy is now in serious con-
tention for theDemocratic flamin-
ation. He has made his views
known on all issues presently
before the electorate.

To end the war in Vietnam,
McCarthy has proposed an eight
step military deescaiation policy:

1. Stop the bombing and seek
negotiation

2. Halt the escalation and
freeze troop strength

3. Cease attempts to uproot
the Viet Cong from areas they
have controlled for many years

5. Conduct a gradual disen-
gagement in the south and a
ceasefire on a trial basis in some
areas while pressing for nego-
tiation

  

6. insist that the South Viet-
namese take on greater military
responsibilities.

'1. Reexamine military policy

8. Press the authorities in
Saigon to broaden their own poli-
tical base by bringing into the
government some of the civilian
opposition elements which were
denied a role in the government
even though they had received
2-3 of the 1967 election vote

0n the question of the recent
riots, Senator McCarthy has said,
“Our response must be neither
to retaliate in anger or to sup-
port improvements as though they
were a bribe to prevent further
riots or, as some have stated,
as though to reward those who
rioted." "The alienation and iso-
lation of the poor today is not
the work of a brutal few but the
indifference of many.”

a youngdooking 48, is frequently
mentioned as. a "dark-horse"
candidate for the Republican Pre-
sidential nomination.

During his early childhood in
in Chicago, his family lived a
while on relief. in high school he

ber of the boar of Bell and
Howell Company. At 29 he was
its President and a mtllionnaire.

He became cluirman of the
national Republican Platform
Committee in 1960. He made an
unsuccesle bid for the lllinois
governorship in 1964; many claim
that his defeat was due to a great
extent to his support for Barry
Goldwater as the GOP's national
standard bearer. in 1966 hechal.
lenged Senator Paul Douglas, his
former college economics pro-

fessor, in the election for the
United State Senate; he won and
has been eyed for the Presidency
ever since.

Percy is one of the leading
“doves” among the Republican
presidential candidates. He has
said: "We owe it to the men who
must fight our wars to promote
peace and peaceful contact in
every way we can. If we must
accelerate the war —- as the ad-
ministration says we must —then
let us also accelerate the pursuit
of peace."

Percy was one of the principle
supporters of the National Home
Ownership Opportunities Act, a
measure with the aim of provid-
ing private homes to low income
families.

Charles Percy showed in his
first year in the Salute a wide
range of knowledge about malor
issues. Not only wide but un-

he outlined the "new civil
rights," McCarthy advocates the
extension to all Americans of
"basis rights which we now hold
belong to every American."
Among these are: the right to
work, medical care and a chance
at good health, the right to a
house in a community, guaran-
tee to every American a mini-
mum livable income, and the
right to an education. . .the
right to the fullest possible in-
tellectual development and. . .to
the retarded and mentally ill in
our society. . .the right to de-
velop to the fullest potential of
their personalities.

As a vote getter, McCarthy
has been phenominal, never hav-
ing lost an election in his 20
years on the political front. He
taught public school and college
for 10 years, has four books to
his credit.

Military Victory,

Though he is only fifty-five
the California born Republican
has been elected twice to the
House of Representatives, once
to the Senate, and twice to the
Vice-Presidency of the United
States. His only two political loss-
es were to John Kennedy for the
Presidency in 1960 and to Pat
Brown for the governorship of
California in 1962.

When he lost to Brown, it look-
ed as though Nixon's political
career was at its end. He said
to newsmen on that occasion:
"Just think how much you're go-
ing to be missing me. You won't
have Nixon to kick around any-
more because, gentlemen, this is
my last press conference."

Despite an extremely lucra-
tive practice as a lawyer in New
York the itch for politics soon
brought him back into public life.
Though he has not hold office for
seven years, he has frequently
stumped the country for Repub-
lican candidates. Nixon when ask-

But Mr. Dirksen has not always

traditionalists to be unfitting a

His supporters say that,

mer helped prevent large scale

ed a hawk as far as the Vietnam

with due care and precision
Nixon is building the image for

problem of the riots must be
forcefully solved without any fur-

appearance in 1960.Characteris-
tic of the '68 Nixon is a more

—New Hampshire, Wisconsin,
Nebraska and Oregon -— the Nixon
forces were or presently

Hampshire and Wisconsin Nixon
captured more than 80 per cent
of the votes cast in the GOP pri-

Nixon has staked out a notably
mobile position somewhere in
the center of the Republican po-
litical spectrum. Supporters be-
lieve that Nixon is the one man
who can bring together the con-
flicting groups within the Repub-
lican Party in the 1998 elec-

Governor Nelson A. Rocke-
feller, 59, is a graduate of Dart-
mouth College. He served Presi-
dent Roosevelt. Truman and
Eisenhower inaseriesofappoint-
ive posts. He was elected Gover-
nor of New York in 1958 over
incumbent Averill Harriman. His
victory bucked the biggest Demo-
cratic tide in years. Democrats
gained 13 seats in the Senate, 46
seats in the House, and increas-
ed their control of governorship
from 29 to 39. in the face of this
rampaging donkey, Rockefeller
scored a landslide victory with
a plurality of 573,000 votes.
Rockefeller was then in turn re-
elected in 1962 and 1966.

in 1960 he helped force in-
clusion of liberal planks in the
Republican platform. in 1964 he
contested Goldwater in a series
of Presidential primaries. Gold-
water, however, had the nominar
tion sewed up through delegate

selections in non-primary states.
He was booed at the convention
for pushing a series of moderate-
to-liberal amendments to the con-
servative platform.

Rockefeller was an early sup
porter of Governor George W.
Romney for the 1968 GOP Pres-
idential nomination, but now the
latter has withdrawn. Nelson
Rockefeller is not actively seek-
ing the Republican Presidential
nomination. But, despite his con-
tinuous denials, he is indeed
available for what he described
as "the toughest lob anywhere
in the world." His noncandidacy
is subject to change.

He is senior in point of ser-
vice among all 50 governors.
For the past 10 years he has
dealt successfully with water and
air polution, narcotic addicts, ex-
pension of higher education,
poverty, race and transportation.

rated as “crutia1”by profession-
al political commentators,Ron-
ald Reagan bested former gover-
nor "Pat" Brown by better than
1 million votes and moved onto
the national political scene.
Shortly after his victory he stat-
ed that he would not be a can-
didate for the Presidencyinl968,
but that he would consider taking
the "favorite-son" nomination.

At 57 he is a middle-of-the-
road Republican, though many
years ago his affiliation was with
the “liberal” Democrats. Rear

In recent months he has made
very few public comments on

but, he faces issues squarely
and handles them with imagine.-
tion, vigor and skillful leader-
ship.

If the Republican’s heralded
pragmatism has taken hold, they
might nominate a man who, ac-
cording to many opinion polls,
has the best chance to win. Rock-
efeller himself is skeptical of
polls. He realizes they can change
overnight under the impact of
events over which he has no
control and he knows also that
the convention delegates who
choose the nominee may pay
little attention to polls. Unfor-
tunately, Rocky's apparent popu-
larity among the people is much
greater than it is among his
party's professionals.

that there is a broad commit-
ment to Rockefeller as an in-
dividual most eminently quali-
fied to be President."

There's no known cure for
Harold Stassen's White House
bug. He has been a candidate
for the Republican nomination
for the presidency in 1948, 1952,
1960, 1964, and now in 1968.

Stassen is a graduate of the
University of Minnesota (8.11.
1927, LL.B. 1929). He was elect-
ed Governor of Minnesota inl939;
he became known as the boy
wonder in politics as he was
only 32 years old at the time
of his election. in 1943 he en-
listed with our armed forces
and temporarily left the arena
of politics.

in 1948 Harold Stassen looked
as if for a while he would crush
Thomas E. Dewey's bid for a
second GOP nomination. Stassen
won in Wisconsin and Nebraska
and the Gallup Poll showed him
running ahead of Dewey through-
out the nation. The two met in
a life-or-death struggle in Ore-
gon and, although Stassen appear-
ed to have a head start, Dewey
put up a vigorous campaign, not

Wallace Makes State’s Rights Issue

George Wallace, formerGov-
ernor of Alabama and husband
of the present Governor, may
find himself in a position to
turn the United States political
scene topsy-turvy next Novem-
ber. Already he has political
Stoops in more than half the
fifty states trying to get his
name on a third ballot.

Wallace actually runs
for the prosidency, he could con-
ceivably win enough votes to pre-
vent either the Democratic or
Republican candidate from ob-
taining a malority. in such a
case, according to the Constitw
tion, the election would be thrown
into the House of Represen-
tatives. This body would be re-
fluired on a one vote one state-
basis to choose the President
from any one of the five loading
cum .e

The forty-eight year old law-
lfor from Clio, Alabama has ser-
ved his state as a legislator,

then a judge, then finally as a
governor for four years. He has
for quite some time been at
war with the federal government
over the civil rights issue, first
as governor and now through his
wife. ,

George Wallace claims that he
does not truly advocate a segre-
gated nation. He merely asserts
the right of each state to de-
termine whether or not it wants
integrated public facilities as
well as the state's true place
as that of more sovereignty.

The breakdown of law and order,’

says Wallace, is the number one
issue in the upcoming election.
Much of Wallace's supportcomes
from blue collar workers who are
afraid of riots and the general
raise in the crime rate in re-
cent years. Wallace ls turning
out large crowds of supporters
where ever he goes. This means
that he is finding support not
only in the South but in the West

and North as well. Wallace has
declared that he might turn over
the country to the police for a
your or two to straighten things
out. As far as the Vietnam ques-
tion goes, Wallace has usually
not stressed this referring more
to crime. When Wallace has
spoken of it he usually states
the he would rely very heavily
on the advice of military aides
. . .When he speaks of protes-
ters to the war he usually re-
fers to them as traitors who
ought to be dealt with as such.

What makes Wallace such a
strong possibility as the person
who could throw the election into
the house in his dynamic person-
ality and a latent fear which elo-
ists in the hearts of many Amer-
icans who claim to be anything
but preludiced. Supporters claim
he has the leadership qualities
and dedication necessary to fight
the centralizing tendency of the
government and stop the
violence in our cities.

 

thenatiohai issues of the day,
thus, all ofhia stands rest onhis
1966 gubernatorial campaign. At
that time he opposed “openness-
ing” legislation and was critical
of the growing number of poop»
on relief. He called for its-
cal responbility in government
and opposed the “bignesa”grow-
ing in the governmental sphere.

Reagan, in his 1966 race,
strongly attacked the "beatniks"
at the University of California
and the “filthy speech move-
ment.” On a nation-wide scale
he believes in bringing back 10-
cal autonomy in dealing with
crime and education. The Cali-
fornia Governor has also been
critical of the Supreme Court
rulings giving what he terms un-
due protection to the criminal

immediately followinghis Cali-
fornia drive‘to victory, Reagan
was asked to comment on the
Negro question. He said, "When
demonstrators take tothestreets
in diaerder and rioting, than you
have to invoke the law, nomatter
who is breaking it. And i‘also
believe this: We have to turn to
the responsible leadership in the
Negro community and ask for
their help, ulstead ofaittingdown
at a table with the self-appointed
leaders who were the ones whose
first reaction was to take to the
streets in violence."

While Reagan has made no
public commitment on the Wet
nam War issue, he is believed
to be critical of the Johnson
policy.
