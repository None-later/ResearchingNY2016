as the Central Connecticutgolfer
scored a miraculous par three on
the 200 yard l7th hole to stave
off a late McCloat rally. Pratt

the most lop-sided victory of the
day, as he downed his Central

Opening: "Game Captured

By Eleventhnmlpnin

Run

An eleventh inning single by Jack Sinnot followed by Jim andy's fourth hit of the
game and a Bridgeport outfielder's miscue gave the Albany State varsity baseball
team an opening game victory, 4-3. over the highly touted Connecticut squad on April
11. in their next game. however, the Danes were held to Gas Golka's lone single, as
Central Connecticut capitalized on eight Albany errors en route to a 5-1 triumph over
the hapless ‘Statesmen. Central Connecticut's Brendan Burke recorded 12 strikeouts

as the winning pitcher.

George Webb buried the
last 6 and a half innings in
the Bridgeport win, giving
up only one run and six
hits while picking up the
win for the Danes.

Albany was held scoreless un-
til the fifth inning when Sandy
and Jim Rourke singled, Joe St.
Onge reached base on an error
to load the bases, and Rich
Spears walked to bring home the
first State score.

Two infield grounders pro-
duced Albany's next two runs,
with no one getting credit for
the R815.

Bridgeport’s runs were spread
throughout the game, as timely
hitting by Joe Santos (four hits)
accounted for all of his team's
tallies. He was credited with run-
batted-in and two runs scored.

In the Central Connecticut

game, Albany scored on two walks
and Galka's single. The score
was tied at one apiece at the top
,of the fifth inning, but then the
Blue Devils pushed across two
runs on two singles and three
Albany errors, giving them the
lead for good.

The Blue Devils added two
more runs in the sixthinnlng with
the help of two more State mis-
cues, leaving the final score at

The bright spots in the young
season thus far has been the
pitching of Webb, (.alka,and Rich
Patrel, as the staff's earned-
run-average is close to 1.50.

State had a total of six games
over the Spring recess, with
games against iiarpur, Oswego,
and Plattsburgh remaining as of
this date.

Next weekend, April 26-27, A1-
bany will vie with Siena and Pots-

tests. The Potsdam twin-bill is

Albany State‘s track club par-
ticipated in their first meet of
the year against the Brandeis,
Boston State and Rhode island
Track teams at Brandeis. Boston
State was first with 711/2 points
Albany was second with 4012
points, Brandeis was third with
33 and Rhode island was last
with 8.

Albany outscored all its op-
ponents in the running svonts.
Don Meyers and Larry Grederick
were first and fourth respective-
ly ih 'the mile. Mike Nolan’s
52.5 and Frank Meyers 53.8were
barely edged out by Boston
State’s Ladlow's 50.9 mark. in
the 100 yard dash, Basil Mor-
gan was second and Terry
Mathias was fourth. in the 120
yard hurdles, Kevin O’Dell placed
fourth. In the 220 yard dash,
Basil Morgan finished first in
22.1 while Scott Price was fourth.
in the half-mile, Joe McAndrsw
finished second in 2:02.4, amere
tenth of a second behind the
2:02.11 of Brandeis’ Gage, with
Don Meyers fourth. Larry Fred-
erick finished second in the two-
mlle in 9:59.5, a new club re-
cord. Pat Gepfert was third and
George Rolling was fourth. The
mile relay team of Frank Meyers,
Jay Kapian, Don Beavers and
Mike Nolan ran second in 3:36.6,
Just behind Boston State’53:35.4.

The field events, as expected,
were a weak point due to a lack
of facilities for proper practice.
Scott Price and Don Beavers

were second and fourth in the
Javelin, respectively. Steph
Smiegel was fourth in the dis-
cus and Tom Sears was tied for
second in the high Jump. Sol
Moshenberg was first in the long
Jump with a 22 fit. 1 in. mark.

‘A ’ Team Falls To Union in F not

After Beating Siena and Union ‘3’

Union A worked the ball iri-
side, rebounded well, and play-
ed strong defense as they rolled
to an easy 51-42 win over Al-
bany A in the finals of the area's
first basketball extra-murals.

The Albany team was slow
and unable to generate an attack
in the early going, so Union
pulled away quickly and went on
to lead by at least 0 for most
of the game.

Albany started to close-in on
several occasions, but each time
the Union squad came up with
the basket when they needed it.

High men for Union were Bob
Seefried with 14, Bill Prescott
with 13, and Barry Holden with
11. Priscott played on the Un-
ion varsity at the beginning of
the season, but he quit, and
was, according to Union's rules,
eligible for intramural play.

Scoring for Albany was well
spread, as there were no real
standouts. Denny Elkin and Rich
Splers hit for 9, while Dave
Goldstein and Ray Mccloat con-
tributed 6 apiece.

Again Albany was playing
against a team that had Worked

together all year long. This time
it really showed. The Union team
worked the ball in close for good
shots, while Albany was forced

to shoot from the outside, and '

no one was hot, so the Albany
squad fell behind and never man-
aged to catch up.

Albany A reached the finals
by scoring a close 57-55 win
over Siena on Wednesday, and
then scoring a tight 60-59 over-
time win over Union B on Thurs-
day. The game with Union had
a real story-book ending. Union
led throughout the entire game,
but the Albany squad slowly clos-
ed the gap to two with less than
a minute remaining. Gary Torino
then stole the ball and lost it,
stole it again and missed the
lay-up, stole it for a third time,
and threw in a long Jumper at
the buzzer.

Albany then outscored Union by
one in the overtime, mainly on
the foul shooting of Torino and
McCloat. High scorers for Albany
were Dave Goldsteln with 12 and
Ed Cole with 10.

ization of the tournament left

quite a bit to be desired, but
the teams were very evenly
matched, and the quality of com-
petition was high, thus it seems
that the extra-murals proved to
be a good thing, that should be
continued.

I Galvin

Moshenberg was also second in
the triple Jump by one inch with
9. 42'3" Jump.

The club is encouraged by the
results of .the meet. The mile
relay, 2-mile, 880 and 100 yard
dash were lost by a yard or less
and several men turned in im-
pressive performances. Mike No
ion was especially impressive as
he ran the 440 in 52.5 and later
anchored the mile relay in 51.8.
Sol Moshenberg’s 22'2" long
Jump promises strength in that
event. Don Meyers looked good
as he ran a 4:31 mile and follow-
ed with a 2:04 half. Scott Price
who was fourth in the 220 and
second in the Javelin will be a
dependable performer. Fred-
erick, Gepfert and Rolling will
provide depth in the two-mile and
Joe McAndrew's 2:02.4 half was
very strong.

Regatta Called
Sailing Club 2nd

A lack of wind prevented all
16 scheduled races from being
held in the Kings Point regatta
on Saturday ioril 6, but the
Albany Sailing Club was tied
for second at the time of the
cancellation.

In the races that \lbany was
able to compete in John Sargalis
and Joe Sullivan combined to
for a win, while Charley Bow-
man teamed with Marge Straub
for a fourth place finish in their
race. Sargalis and Bowman ser-
ved as skippers, while Sullivan
and Straub were crew.

Sunday's activities were call-
ed off in respect of Dr. Martin
Luther King, thus the regatta
was never completed, but Al-
bany's second place finish in a
field of eight, that included Ste-
vens institute, Southampton,
Maritime, St. Francis, Ursinus,
Lehigh, George Washington, and
iin.Y.U. is certainly encourag-

g.

The Sailing team traveled to
West Point over the vacation,
and have two minor regattas
remaining. One on April 11 at
Hobart, and the Associate mem-
ber championship at Princeton.

APA Defeated By KB

spring recess, and in the lea.-
gue's opener, KB dumped the
defending champions, APA, by
a 8-7 score.

The game was tied 7-7 after

tie breaker in the bottom of the
eighth. Dave Goldstein opened up
with a double, moved to second

ed on a sacrifice fly by Buzzy
Ostrowskl.

APA had Jumped into an early
lead, as a double by Mike Gil-
martin and a triple by Rich

ever, scoring two in their half
of the first and than four in
the second, two of them on a
home run by hurler Ray Cascia.
APA came back with two in the
fifth, KB then scored once in
the sixth, and APA got one in
the seventh to send the game
into extra innings. Cascia got
the win for KB, while Roger

its opener gaining a 7-4 win
over a aubborn TXO squad.
George Margam's single drove

in two runs in the second for
TXO, and his squad led 2-1.
However, Potter picked up one
in the third, two in the fourth,
and one in the fifth. TXO came
back with two in the fifth, on
a single by Ovalle, but Potter
clinched it with two in the
seventh, on a double by Larry
Marcus, and singles by Dan Crip-
pen and Jack Adams.

Crippen recorded 8 strikeouts
and yielded only four hits in
recording the win, but his 001k
trol was not sharp, as he issued
seven walks, Mike Stacy took the
loss for TXO.

in other League i action STB
parlayed six hits and four errors
for 9 runs in the first, and they
then stumbled home to a 12-10
win over the Clinton Comets.
Both teams were very sloppy,
but the hits were numerous, as
STB got 14 and Clinton 11. Dick
Woytek was STB's standout, as
he had three hits and turned in
a fine defensive effort. Tom Pot.
tor was Clinton's top hitter, as
he rapped three hits including a
homer in the fourth. Dunc Nixon
got the win despite eight walks,
and Marv Cole was tagged with
the loss.

mission.

to Barb 9.55,,”

The Ad Hoc committee .or
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr., has advanced the hope to
raise up to $25,000 in King's
name to help the underprivileg-
ed.

To demonstrate united con-
cern for one of America’s most
pressing problems (America's
poor and their plight), and to
help the disadvantaged, the theme
of the fund raising drive and
the subsequent scholarships will
be to honor King and his ideals.

In a meeting held last week,
Tom Lynch, graduate teaching
assistant and chairmanof the new
Scholarship Committee stated:
"Our demonstration (the iuntil
drive) is designed to influence
people by (1) action, and (2)
results."

“Action, in this campaign is
getting as many people as pos-
sible involved to show the depth
of our Joint committment. 'Re-
sults,’ in this Campaign, is get-
ting the largest sum of money
possible.”

Acquiring money for the fund
will be mainly a university ef-
fort. Four universitygroups,fac.
ulty, students, personnel, and al-
umni, will be solicited for funds.

Many faculty members have
considered pledging as much as
10 per cent of one month’s sal-
ary to the fund. The minimum
needed from the undergraduates
alone is $5,000, and for the total
scholarship, $10,000, but it is
hoped that the total will reach
far above the minimum amount.

Hopefully, the fund will be in
effect by next fall, or as soon
as possible. it will be a con-
tinuing memorial with scholar-
ships created from the interest
while the principle will remain
intact.

Solicitation of funds from stu-
dents and student groups will
be under way very soon. About
150 people are needed to con-
tact students on a door-imioor
basis.

FRIDAY,IMAY 3, 1968'

Brinkley

by Tim Keeley

Sta/f Ifnportcr
David Brinkley of NBC News
will be the guest speaker this
Sunday at the inauguration of
the new LAAC and Central Coun-
cil at 2 pm. in the gymnasi-

um.

"One thing i try to do,"
says David Brinkley, explaining
his newscasting philosophy, "is
to write scripts with the ut-
most simplicity and clarity. if
a line or two of background is
needed first to have the main
element of a story make bet-
ter sense, 1 put it in, than get
to the 'lead' a little later."

Such an approach works in
television Journalism, as the
success of “The Huntley -Brink-
ley Report" on NBC-TV proves,
but Brinkley’s reporting skill
grew out of years of experience
as a newspaper reporter.

in addition to many broad-
casting honors, Brlnkley was
chosen for the 1964 Golden Key
Award by six leading educational
organizations for his significant
contributions to the national wel-
fare.

President Lyndon B. Johnson
appointed him a member of the
National Council on the Arts.

Brinkley and his New York-
based colleague, Chet Huntley,
both entered Journalism early
in life and worked their separ-
ate ways up until they met at
NBC News in Washington.

He is bemused by such in-
cidents as the time he was cov-
ering a candidate in the 1964
Oregon primary and attracted

a larger crowd than the candi-
date.

Brinkley contends he is a re-
porter, not a personality, and
he tries to make clear the im-
portant difference.

Brinkley was born in Wilming-
ton, N.C. on July 10, 1920. He
got his start in news, after
high school and a stretch in the
Army, on his hometown paper,
the Wilmington Star-News.

dors for next year will be an-
nounced.

Makes War Comments

President Evan R. Collins dis.
cussed the Teach-1n, the war in
Viet Nam and related issues at
Monday's President's Confer-
ence with Students.

A crowd of over 80 students
packed the Patroon Lounge, to
hear President Evan R. Collins’
comments on the teach-in, Viet-
nam War and related issues last
Monday afternoon.

Collins lauded the Teach-in by
commenting, "it was well organ-
ized and effectively run."

When asked why he didn't speak
at the event, he declared, “Look-
ing back now in retrospect lwould
have spoken, but last Monday
when i made my decision the is.
sue was too confused."

A student then interjected, "I

Genocide,

by Ira Wolhnan

"Aren't we all guilty of gen-
ocide by implication?” Dr. Hugo
Bedau, one of 30 speakers at
the teach-in held here Thursday
and Friday, April 25 and 26,
questioned his audience. The guilt
of the American people was one
of the many topics aired at the
teach-1n.

Drawing speakers from
schools such as Tufts University,
Harvard, Princeton, RPl, and
Buffalo State, the teach-1n reach—
ed over 800 students, accord-
ing to estimates by teach-intend-
ers.

Mary Ann McNaughton of the
Philadelphia Quaker Action
Group opened the Thursday ses-
sion of the teach-1n by discus-
sing her recent voyages to both
North and South Vietnam on the
medical supply ship Phoenix. She
addressed approximately 50 stu-

dents, who responded Wlm ques-
tions concerning the voyage's le-
gality and her current status with
the government.

Following that, Prof. Hugo Be-
dau, professor of Philosophy at
Tufts, discussed the War Crimes
Tribunals held last year. He ad-
mitted to those present that he
had no special knowledge of the
Tribunal’s work — simply what
he had read in four sources,
including "War Crimes in Viet-
nam," by Bertrand Russell, and
an article in the February issue
of Ramparts magazine written
by Jean Paul Sartre (which ac-
cused the United States of gen-
ocide in Vietnam).

this statement a round of ap-
plause Went up among many of
the students present.

Next a question was raised over
intimidation created by profes-
sors who counted absences on
Thursday and Friday as double
cuts.

"This action would indicate
that some instructors made the
choice for students of whether
or not they should attend the
teach-in," qulpped one student.

This student also asked what
President Collins would do if a
student had to drop a class be-
cause ofabsenses stemming from
the teach-in.

"i would try sweet reason with
the professor to get you back in,"
Collins said, "This is all lead

The topic then shifted into the
war in Viet Nam. During the
course of the discussion Collins
expressed his personal convic-
tions about the war.

"i feel we have made errors in
Judgment that have caused us to
become deeply involved," Col-
lins remarked seriously, "Pres-
ently our position is morally and
politically lndefensive."

He further advocated that we
should “pull out" without losing
face.

Collins was then confronted
with a petition signed by over
300 students that advocated a
course in social problems.
