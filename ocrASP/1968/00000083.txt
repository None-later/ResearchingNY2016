Collins a'nnounced a re sal
tilt [is currently beforetlte gus-
tees of the State University. The
proposal favors a mandatory stun
dent tax to be levied on all cam-
puses of the State University.

The amount of the tax, how-
ever, would be decided upon by
each campus. The funds would
then remain on campus for stu-
dent activities.

At present student tax is vol-
untary. Under this system stu-
dent governments are faced with
hazy budgets, not knowing how
many students will subscribe to
student tax.

A student present, represent-
ing a group participating in the
teach-in that was scheduled for
April 25 and 26, extended a per-
sonal invitation to Collins to at-

"Because we are in Albany,
we Ire like bugs under a micro-
scope," Collins declared.

This was in reference to ac.
tion taken by state legislators
whenever the University hits the
news.

Collins then revealfd a report
on future plans for increasing

the athletic status of the Univer-
s ty.
Collins remarked that .“sev-
eral copies of this report will be
n reserve in the library." He
hen read a few selections.
When asked to comment per-
sonally on the report, he hesi-
tantly said "i believe the report
is thorough and complete; if that
is sufficiently evasive."

President Collins also anal

nounced the appointment of Dr.
Paul F. Wheeler as the third
Associate Dean of the College of
Arts and Sciences.

The students present were in.
formed that the 52 students tint
demonstrated against Dow had
their day in the Supreme Court.

Their attorney Jonathan Har-
vey, brought the case to court to
ask the University to show cause
why it should exercise control
over students.

Supreme Court Justice T. Paul
Calne ruled tint the court should
not intervene in University policy
and dismissed the case.

Harvey stated that the case
would now go on to the Appel-
late Division of the states courts.

"This is only serving as a de-
laying tactic to prevent the Uni-
versity from taking action," cri-
ticised Collins.

Collins had begun the confer-
ence on a light note by reading a
postcard he had received from
Daytona Beach, Florida.

"We are having a great time.
Thank you for a much needed va-
cation. Wish you were here."
The card was signed with the
student numbers of six students.

Student Volunteers Assist

Appalachian

Nine University students were
among the volunteers who went
to Appalachia over Spring Re-
cess. They were invited by a lo-
cal welfare department to par-
ticipate in In experimental pro-
gram called the "Adopt a Fam.
ily Plan."

The reason for the girls trav-
eling to Grundy, Virginia,asmall
town without industry, was to Is-
slst the social workers there in
visiting underpriviledged fami-
lies. Each girl spent many hours

lking to poor whites.

it was hoped that by the ex-
change of cultural ideas, the fam-
ilies could learn from the goals
the volunteers had. However, the
students also increased theirown
education as I result of the trip.

Father Paul Smith of La Salle
Chapel accompanied the stu-
dents. He was moved by the sim-
plicity of the lives of the people
on welfare he visited. Comment.
log on the narrowness oi their
goals, he said that their culture
is ". . . pathetic in the sense
that eacept for the physical work
of the men, there was no other
goal to shoot for."

Cindy Gllbertson, a student at
the University, stares similar
views on the predicament of the
low income family she worked
with. She felt that she-gained
an insight into the fact that peo.
ple do live in many different life
situations, all ofwhich were quite
unlike her own priviledged posi-

on.

Cindy also learned that it was
impossible to propose a clear-
cut solution to aid the many poor
and uneducated shack dwellers.
instead of finding I family with
a definite problem, she encoun-
tered people who struggled with
the many small difficulties that
arise in dayvttuiay living.

The social worker who brief-
ed the students asked them to
see if there was any

the life conditions within the
families they visited. Many of
the volunteers were able to sense
and to help inspire such "move-
ments."

Volunteers were able to get
leaky floor boards repaired and
install doors on hinges. One
volunteer encouraged I mother
to attend adult education courses
in the fall. Another was success-
ful in convincing I man to apply
for the benefits he was entitled
to under social security.

(Communique) The Urban
League of Albany, :1 social serv-
ice agency is one of a national
system of Urban Leagues made
up of 88 local affiliates.

The Urban League's goal is to
equalize opportunities for disad-
vantaged minorities and other
disadvantaged groups, especially
in the areas ofemployment, hous-
ing, education and youth incen-
tives, and health and welfare.

The Urban League seeks to
achieve its goal through com-
munity organization and-or social
work methods. That is, it studies
and analyzes facts about the com-
munity to discover problems and
causes, then develops programs
which are designed to give guid-
ance and help to disadvantaged
groups so that they may share
equally the responsibilities and

rewards of citizenship.

Locally, the Urban League,
which began operations in June,
1967, is worklngactively in Hous-
ing, Employment, Education and
Youth Incentives.

A Housing Workshop, co-spon-
sored by the Fair Housing Com-
mittee of the Y.W.C.A., was held
in January of this year. It was

start June 3 for the duration of
nine weeks, terminating on Aug-

Collins On War

Collins expressed his concern
for the need and commended the
student for his approach to the
problem.

A student also suggested that
Collins should hold more confer-
ences during the week. To this
Collins remarked, “i have been
coming here for more than 60
Mondays. We come half way,
it's up to students to come the
other half."

Collins' concluding remarks
were, “i tiunk you for express.
log your opinions here today.
This is the best way of building
up communication lines between

majors, although other students
are invited to apply.

in addition to the clerical work,
a limited amount of field work
will be involved. Students able to
work full-time during this per-
iod are preferred, although part-
time workers will also be con-
sidered.

The work is detailed and will
involve the local verification and
coding of street address ranges
in the metropolitan areas of Al-
bany, Schenectady and Troy for
the 1970 Census.

Since this 1970 Census will be
conducted almost exclusively by
mail, it is necessary to obtain
accurate addresses In this sum-
mer research project. The in-
formation obtalned from this geo.

facilitate the Bureau of the Cen-

ing in this area and to carve out
a role for the Urban League where
it could serve best.

A city-wide coordinating com-
mittee resulted, which is working
in areas of prime concern in
relation to the housing situation
in Albany.

in the Economic Development
and Employment Department, a
joint venture has been launched
with settlement houses and other
agencies on order to reach more
effectively those in need ofwork.

This will decentralize our em-
ployment program and make
more efficient the use of man-
power and skills of each partici-

pating agency. Placements are
made almost daily.

"Motivation" is the touchstone
to hill utilisation of one's talents
and capabilities. A lack of this
important characteristic is seen
to be a great contributor to low
aspirations and failure.

Thus, the Albany Urban League
has set into operation a compre-
hensive program entitled "Moti.

in progress are the "College Ex-
ploration Program" and "To.

' ‘ Anthro Prof

Slated To Give

Inaugural

Dr. William N. Fenton, a new
professor of Anthropology at A].
bany will give an inaugural speech
on "Anthropology and the Uni.
versity" Wednesday. May an
3 PM. in the Assembly Room
in the Campus Center. The ad.
dress is the first inaugural
speech ever given by a new pro.
fessor at the University.

Commissioner for the New York
State Museum and Sciences Serv.
ices. He is an expert in the field
of ’ ethnohistory, the application

historical sources on native cul.
tures.

One of Fenton's aims here is
to attract graduate students to
the area of anthropology having
to do with American Indian tribal
organizations as representative
of native political systems. He
has been instrumental in the re.
birth of interest by graduate slu.
dent} in using museum collec-
tions and library materials inhis
former position.

Council Supports Strike,

M YSKANIA M0

by Vic Looper
Stu/f li’i'I/m'fizr

Central Council approved 15--
4-1 a position statement, which
supported the "aims and ideals
of the international Student
Strike held on April 26 against
the War in Vietnam, Racial Op-
pression and the Draft at its
April 25 meeting.

The position introducod by Jay
Silverman stated that "Council
takes the position that any stu-
dent who does not wish to par-
ticipate in the Strike should not
be deprived of the opportunity
for instruction at his regularly
scheduled classes.

James Kalm amended this to
strike out the phrase "at his reg-
ularly scheduled classes.” This
was done to take care ofthe prob-
lem of whether teachers should
call off classes or not. Kahn felt
that the position as originally in-
troduced would have meant that
teachers couldn’t cancel classes.
lie felt that since Councildoesn’t
represent the teachers it can't
tell them what to do.

President Jeffrey Mlshkin, the
co-autlior of the hill emphasized
that Council only supported the
aims and ideals not necessarily
the method.

Council also gave MYSKANIA
a $400 loan out of next year’s
budget. The money will be used

for a variety of purposes. $100

would be used for a picnic for
the old and new MYSKANIA mem.
bers, $170 would go for printing
costs of the Student Association
Inauguration which will be held
Sunday, May 5 during Explosion
’68.

$100 would be used to help es-
tablish a Scholarship Fund in
memory of the Rev. Dr. Martili
Luther King Jr. and $30 would
be used for operating expenses.

This loan was questioned quite
seVerely, not because it was a
loan on next year's budget or be-
cause of the amounts asked for
but because of what it was being
used for.

The money for the Scholar-
ship was also attacked. It was
pointed out that there were three
budgets which were being con-
sidered for funding by the Ad-hoc
Solicitations Committee. These
budgets involve giving SA funds
to charitable groups. The in-
consistencies in giving money al-
lowing MYSKANlA to support a
charitable event and not allow-
ing other groups to do it were
again pointed out.

Jeffrey Mishkin, the Chairman
of MYSKANIA, pointed out that
they were not like any other
group because they were elected
by the entire University and rep-
resented vcry broad elements.
lie pointed out that they were

Choices Offered _ '

LAAC met last week and de-
cided that since the "any 14 out
of‘ 20 meal plan" is $280 per
semester and the "20 mealplan"
is $200 per semester, it would
be more profitable to discard the
former in favor of the latter.

in addition, LAAC has asked
that University Food Service in-
clude the present 14 meal plan.
in compliance Food Service will
ofer these board options:

—A 14 meal plan including
breakfast and dinner Monday
through Saturday, and breakfast
and lunch (noon meal) on Sunday.
($460 per year)

—A 20 meal plan which in- 4
eludes breakfast, lunch and din-
ner every day except on Sunday
when the dinner meal is served
at noon and no evening meal is
provided ($580 per year).

—A kosher meal option is
available for each of the above
meal plans (a $000. and b $730).
Frozen dinners, labeled with the
"o"-"U" symbol,signlfying cer-
tification as kosher, willbe serv-
ed when standard dlnners are
served.

University Food Service pro-
vides the first contract meal for
all students the morning after
they arrive at their residence
halls.

When vacations and holidays
begin at noon, the last contract
meal served as is breakfast on
that day. When vacations and
holidays begin after the last class
the last contract meal served is
breakfast the following day.

The first contract meal serv.
ed after a vacation or holiday is
breakfast on the day classes re-
sume.

Students are permitted to eat
in any of the contractdining halls
upon presentation of their food
validation card. .

Food validation cards are giv-
en en the first day of each month

Cut by Federal Budget

Due to the tightness in the
Federal budget, the amounts
available for student aid pro-
grams are not sufficient to cover
the amounts requested by
colleges and universities
throughout the country.

The University applied for Fed-
eral funds to operate a National
Defense Loan Program of 1,350
loans totalling over $080,000,
however, the tentative Federal
authorization ($406,523) plus col-
lections and the matchingportion
provided by the State, will per-
mit only a program of approx-
imately $500,000.

The University’s request for
Educational Opportunity Grant
funds have been cut to $350,850
and a reduction in the number of
anticipated awards will be nec-
essary. The College Work-Study
request was cut to $217,020 for
the fall of 1008.

However, the federal funds plus
matching funds and a carryover
from the current adaccmic year
will permit the Universityto pro-
vide jobs to almost all eligible
students who desire to work.

While the deadline for finan-
cial aids applications was May
1, the Office of Financial Aids
may still accept requests for did
until May 10. All students apply-
ing for College Work-Study Pro-
gram positions and N.Y,li.E.A.

Corporations Loans for the com-
ing academic year to file the
Parents' Confidential Financial
Statement.

Both full-time and part-time
summer jobs will be available
this summer through the Work-
Study Program, a limited number
of which will be located in other
areas of New York State. The
University will offer summer
housing to students employed in
the area.

Students applying for full 1968
should have their N.Y_11.E,A.
Corporation Loan applications on
file no later than Julie 1, as
serious delays result when the
University, the banks, and the
N,Y.H.E.A, corporation are de-
layed with applications duringthe
summer. Forms are available in
BA 109.

and are good for the meals de-
signated on the card for a month.

At the general information
meeting to be held iii each resi-
dence ball during the week of
May 0-10, 1968, to select rooms,

"students will have the opportun-

ity to do one of the following:

a. select the board plan'de-
sired from the plans available,
or b. cancel their room contract
for Fall 1968 and select off-
campus housing.

By May 10, all students must
have made their board selec-
tions. The entire contract is in
effect for the entire year as of

.this date.
