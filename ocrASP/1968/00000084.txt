Over 600 from Area Participate

In Anti-war March to Capital Capitol

“Our war is here — not in
Vietnam" —— Sam McDowell, a
member of the Brothers spoke
at a rally before 600 marchers,
and summed up effectively the
theme of a march held Saturday,
April 27 in Albany.

Held the day after the inter-
national Student Strike for Peace
in Vietnam, the march was com-
posed of varying groups from the
neighboring cities.

The groups participating in
the march were: students, pro-
fessional groups, organizations,
(such as SDS, SANE and CDA),
labor, and residents of the tri-
city area.

The marchers met at 12:00
noon in St. Mary’s Park on Par-
tridge Street and Washington Ave.
nue. From there, accompanied
all the while by a police escort,
the marchers\began their trek

downtown. Marching 4 abreast,
the total number participating in
the march was estimated at some.
where over 600 people.

Chanting slogans such as
"Freedom Nowi Peace Now!”
and “Support the Boys in Viet-
nam. Bring them home nowl"
the marchers elicited definite,
though mixed reactions from the
citizens of Albany.

The marchers were instructed
to ignore any hecklers they might
encounter along the way. There
was little trouble of any kind,
however,~throughout the day’s
activities.

Some people were impressed
with the march, while others reg-
istered negative comments. A
shop owner onCentral Avenue felt
that "Although i agree with the
basic principles of the march, I
think that greater adult support

tee to End the War in Vietnam.

Friday's teach-in was coordi-
nated by Ed Silver and Eddie
Shaw, co-chairmen, along with
Dr. David Harvey of the English
Department.

Among the featured speakers
on Friday was Dr. Merit Ab-
rash of RP], who read an amus-
ing and pointed satire of a fab-
ricated "conspiracy" between
top rank Russian leaders that
supposedly occurred sometime
just prior to the 1064 presiden-
tial elections.

in the afternoon session Dr.
Donald Mochon of the Art De-
partment contributed wit to the
teach-in with political cartoons
and commentary of his own.

During a break in the speak-
ers on Friday, Eddie Shaw rend
a central council proclamation
concerning the teach-in.

The bill stated “that Central
Council support the aims and
ideas of the International Student
Strike . . . on Friday, April
20, 1968," and,

“that Central Council take
the position that any student who
does not wish to participate in
the strike should not he depriv-
ed of the opportunity for in-
struction of his regularly sched-
uled classes. The nudioncelu'oke

Ed Silver both expressed their
happiness and satisfaction with
the results. Shaw stated - "l
was very pleased to see the
very fine turnout for Friday's
teach-in, both in regard to the
number of students and the turn-
over rate. My personal opin-
ion is that many students got
more out of attending Friday's
teach-in than they would have
by attending their regularly
scheduled Friday classes.”

Shaw also reiterated that Dr.
David Harvey of the English de-
partment had contributed "101
per cent" to the success of
the teach-in and that "his de-
votion and work were invalu-
able.”

seriously." On the other hand,
John Fouiks, a member of the
Brothers, felt that the march
proved that “not all people are
apathetic -— that somebody wants
to do something now." He felt
that the march was simply "Beau-
tiful."

Two businessmen watching the
parade offered only the comment
that the march was “nice and
peaceful." Refusing to comment
at all were three soldiers seen
watching from the side street in
front of the Washington Armory.

The marchers reached the Cap-
itol at 1:00 p.m. They were mill-
ing around until approximately
2:00 p.m. when the program of
speakers and entertainers was
scheduled to begin.

A mong the many speakers were
Brother's representatives Wil-
liam Gibson, Sam McDowell and
Robert Gene Dobbs. The sole
faculty speaker from this Uni-
versity was Dr. Harry Hamilton,
who was also present inthe capa-
city of Vice President of the‘lo-

Peter Buch, Socialist Work-
er's Party candidate for Con-
gress from the l9thCongression-
at District in N.Y.C. was sues.t
speaker of the Young Socialists
Discussion Group Monday after-
noon, April 8.

Bush stated that although he
himself was runninngr office,he
would talk about Socialism and
the movement for Fred Halstead
for President and Paul Boutelie
for Vice-President and to encour-
age students to vote in Choice ’68.

The main issues of the Social-
ist platform include bringing the
Gl's home from Vietnam and
promoting black control of the
black community. However, Buch
feels that all people who are
against the war in Vietnam should
vote for the Socialist ticket, even
if they do not agree with each
point in the Socialist platform.

He feels that the Socialist tick-
at is the only real alternative to
the Democratic and Republican
parties which are essentially the
same, and who will run candi-
dates that represent the rich ele-
ments of society. He stated that
both parties are against student
power and freedom, and that they
are both responsible for slums,
violence, and poverty.

In a private Interview, Buch
said that he could not support any
Democratic or Republican nom-
inee, because they are just two
factions of the same party . . .
Capitalism. Capitalism, hefeels,
is the party of the large corpor-
ations, banks, etc. . .

What Buch advocates, is Dem-
ocratic Socialism, with the gov-
ernment owning railroads, banks,
industry, etc., as the represen-
tative of the people. He feels
that the national government now
is similar to just another large

bureaucratic corporation, and
that it is responsive to big busi-
ness, but not to the poor.

Buch expressed the Opinion
that the President should be
merely the administrator of the
people’s wishes, and subject to
immediate recall. When it was
remarked that this could be un-
stable, Buch said that it would be
good to have a period of trial
and error to discover what is
right for 'the country. The gov-
ernment could then be changed
and modified according to what
changes were needed.

Democracy should be strict and
total, according to Bush, and If
someone feels that the public is
not qualified to participate in the
government he should try to edu
eats all the people.

A labor party shouldbe formed
to represent the workers and the
bureaucratic labor leaders
should be dismissed from the
unions.

A LBANY-STUDENT PRESS

by Gwen McLaughlin

Thirty recruit high school
graduates between 17 and 20 from
urban and rural poverty areas
throughout the state to the Uni-
versity is the main objective of
the College Opportunity Program
(C.O. P.) at the University.

There are two criteria for se-
lecting the students. First, they
must come from families whose
economic situation prevents them
from contributing to their child’s
education.

Second, the student's records
must be such that he would be
inadmissible to the University in
accordance with present stan—
dards (the students must have
either graduated from high school
or have an equivalency diploma).

The students will be supported
in full by the University, will be
full-time students, and will live
on campus.

The recruitment for C.0.P.
was done by University staff,
high school guidance counselors,
and interested community ac-
tion groups throughout the state.
Robert Shostack, administrator
of the program, states, "To date,
well over one hundred applica-
tions have been received,from as
far west as Buffalo, as far south
as New York City, and from the
cities of Elmira, Schenectady,
Amsterdam and Albany."

Interviews for applicants start-
ed on April 29, and the deadline
for applications is May 20. On
June 6, letters of acknowledg-
ment of acceptance to the C.O.P.
will go out for all applicants at
the same time.

The thirty students accepted for
the C.0.P. will come for a one-
day orientation on saturday,June
15. On June 30, a summer ses-
sion for six weeks will begin with
a reception for parents and
friends. The C.0.P. students will
participate in ,the regular sum-
mer freshman orientation (plam
hing conferences) on July 1 and
then commence their six-week
session concentrating on Eng-

Psychedelic Talk
On Botany Given .

A psychedelic presentation of
botany was given by Dr. David
Drum to the students of the Uni-
versity. Drum, a professor otthe
University of Massachusetts, us-
es these unnsualpsychedelic met-
hods to teach his own classes.

in the lecture room which was
in complete darkness, the first
sound was that of a glass smash-
ing against the wall, followed by
numerous songs by the Beatles
and Simon and Garfunkie.

During this time three films'
were shown simultaneously. On
one screen were some primitive
people engaged in a war, while
on the other were pictures of golgi
bodies, endoplasmic reticulum,
and macromolecules.

He also had films about how
plants tell time, pictures of the
first rays at dawn and various

ther phenomena. Occasional,
rum would stand up, launch into
a long complicated speech, then
promptly sit down.

Another glass shuttered, and
the lecture was over. This pres~
entatlon, although not typical of

his classroom lectures, was used
to show the methods he employs.

Drum got his Ph.D. in low,
and has since studiedinGermany
and England. He is interested in
using various media in communi-
cation.

The staff for the University

tion beginning June lOInmethods

Shostack states that, ('The em-
phasis in course work is the de-
velopment of skills of individual
students and building on what the
student has." No attempt is tobe
made to identify or differentiate
these C.0.P. students in any way
from any of the other students
on campus after their arrival,
and, according to Shostack,
"These students will be the van-
guard of the hundreds ofstudents
who will be comingtoour campus
in the future."

Student Evaluation .
0f Courses, Teachers

SECT, the realization of a
dream about student-faculty in-
teraction.

The initials stand for Student
Evaluation of Courses and Teach-
ers. The purposes for establish-
ing the organization; first, to let
the student know what other stu-
dents think about the courses he
will be taking, and second, to
make this same information
available to the instructors teach-
ing these courses. This will allow
faculty and students to work to-
gether for the improvement of
the courses offered.

SECT, a predominantly fresh-
man organization, is, as of April
3 this year, a standing commit-
tee under Academic Affairs Com-
mission, and is now workingtow-
ards the completion of its first
evaluation booklet. They will at-
tempt to evaluate, using infor-
matirn taken from question-
naires, each introductory and
non-prerequisite mum to be
offered next spring, and make
their conclusions readily avail-
able in booklet form. This book-
let will enable the student to se-
lect courses which will satisfy
his requirements during Fall pre-
registration.

During the last two weeks of
classes this semester question—
naires, for the students and in-
structors of the aforementioned
courses, will be distributed. The

committee requests that eachof
you start to think about the cours-
es you are taking or teaching, so
that when the time comes to re-
cord your comments, you will not
be making emotional decisions.

The future of this publication,
and student voice in the choiced
course material rests on intelli-
gent cooperation between the stu-
dents and faculty. With this in
mind consider what your courses
mean to you, and be prepared to
make your anonymous contribu-
tion to the growth of our educa-
tional system.
