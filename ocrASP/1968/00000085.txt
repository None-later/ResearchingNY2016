Cooperation
In Clean-Up

Efforts will be resumed to
clear away construction trash,
prepare unplanted regions for
seeding, repair and replace sod

which suffered winter kill, and ,

plant shrubs and trees with the
arrival~d spring weather. Stu-
dents will notice that numerous
areas on campus will be receiv-
ing this treatment.

Your cooperation is needed if
the work is to be accomplished
without interference and in the
most expeditious manner. It into
our common interest to assist in
levietry way possible with this ef-
o .

The areas in question will be
easily identiﬁed by the obvious
presence of mechanical equip-
ment and apparatus for the ac-
complishment of the above pur-
poses. The cooperation of all
concerned is requested to the end

lghgt we may promptly finishthese
o s.

Anyone who has attended the

University for even a brief per-
“ iod will know how badly this is
needed. We are especially vulner-
able to sandstorms, and most of
you have had all too many oppor-
tunities to sample the effects of
them.

Spring in this part of the world
is about the only time when ef-
fective planning can be ac-
complished. Please help us to
take advantage of this annual gold-
en opportunity. Cooperate with
the campus police and the con-
tractors’ personnel where it is
obvious that they are trying to
clear areas to accomplish this
work.

In this same connection, it is
in the springtime when the rains'
have softened the turf that it
leaves existing lawns in an ex-
tremely vulnerable condition.
Please use your very best judg-
ment in refraining from walking
or playing on these surfaces while
the turf is wet and subject to
damage.

The Director of Physical Edu-
cation and his staff will be able
to inform you where authorized
play areas exist. On all other
areas, we rely on your use of
good judgment. Vehicles, espec-
ially, are harmful to the turf
when they are driven over the
grass at this season of the year,
and we have already experienced
some very bad damage as a result
of carelessness in this respect.

King Scholarship
Established

(Carl/.tnllrfd [mm Page I)

A sub - committee has been
appointed to the Scholarship Com-
mittee to decide specifically how
the fund can be used most bene-
ficially for the poor.

Many people are needed to
make suggestions to the com-
mittee, solicit funds, and to con-
tribute as much as they can to
the fund. As Lynch stated: “The
memorial scholarship fund is one
common way that we, as people
in a university community, can
help the less advantaged.

Controversy At U. of Alabama

(CPS) — When the University
of Alabama held its annual Em-
phasis program several weeks
ago, one of the principal speak-
ers was to have been Yale Uni-
versity Chaplain William Sloane
Coffin.

However, Coffin -—- one of five

men indicted by a Federal grand.

jury for counseling young people
to violate the Selective Service
Act -— did not appear here. At
the advice of the university ad-
ministration, his invitation was
rescinded by the Emphasis com—
mittee about four weeks before
the program.

University President Frank A.
Rose did not demand that the
committee, which included both
students and faculty members,
rescind Coffin’s invitation. He
merely explained that having a
‘ ‘controversiai" speaker on cam-
pus would strain the already
poor relations between the uni-
versity and the state legislature.

The committee was able to un-
derstand the possible repercus-
sions Rose had in mind. Only
last year, several state legisla-
tors called for Rose’s resigna-
tion after articles by black power
advocate Stokely Carmichael and
communist Bettina Aptheker ap-
peared in an Emphasis publica-
tion.

Alcoholic beverages will be
allowed only in "Norton Hall and
in the residence halls," Dr.Rlch-
ard A. Siggelkow, vice-president
for student affairs, announced.
Regulations were determined by

the Norton Hall House Commit

tee and the individual residence
house councils.

The rules for the dormitories
outline the areas where alcohol
may be consumed. Violations will
be referred to the inter-Resi-
dence Judiciary.

ln Norton Hall, individual stu-
dents will not be allowed to " bring
their own” and drink anywhere
within the student union. Requests
to serve alcoholic beverages at
any function must be made one
week in advance. The organiza—
tion requests this permission of
the House Committee. ‘

These rules will be altered
when the Faculty Student Associ-
ation purchases a license to sell
alcoholic beverages in Norton
Hall.

The Committee on Alcoholic
Beverages, which drafted the reg-
ulations for liquor on campus,
will now serve as an Alcoholic
Review Board “pro tem." Pres-
ident Meyerscn will appoint it
new board before December,
1968, but he is expected to main—
tain the representation of stu-
dents, faculty and student per-
sonnel.

The Review Board will meet
at the end of April to consider
extension of the liquor policy to
other areas on the campus. Pre-
sently, the campus buildings Olli-
er than the union and residence
halls are “dry.”

King Scholarship Fund

The following is a letter sent
to all students concerning the
Martin Luther King Scholarship
Fund Drive. Its aim is to raise
funds for financial aid grants
at the University for disadvan-
taged students.

Fellow students,

Recently, a group of concerned
students, faculty members, and
administrative officers organ-
ized into an ad hoc Committee
to initiate a scholarship
memorial fund in memory d
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and
the ideas he represented.

This fund is intended to be a
continuing memorial to provide
persons living in deprived areas
with financial aid in attending
our University.

The fund raising for the
scholarship is further intended to
be an 'all-University project. in
raising the needed money we are
counting on and indeed must have
financial support of faculty, ad-
ministrative officers and per
sonnel, and of course, ' ludents.

As students,we unquestionably
have the largest man-powerforce
and therefore, it should be easy
for us to raise a sum of money
larger than any of the other
groups. And I believe we can
do this quickly and efficiently.

In about a week .a student from
your dorm will be contacting you
and asking you to make a dona-
tion to the scholarship fund drive.
We have set the student goal at
a minimum of $5,000 and we are
asking that each student donate
$2.00 or whatever he feels he
can.

i sincerely hope you will con-
tribute to this drive and there-
by indicate your concern with at
least one small aspect of one of

the most significant and challeng-
ing problems facing our country
today.

(CPS) — All three of the Dem-
ocratic candidates for President
favor some form of random se-
lection as a substitute for the
present draft system, but all
three have slightly different pro-
posals.

Nixon favors abolition of the
draft and institution of a volun-

sent system of autonomous local
boards and Selective Service Di-
rector Lewie Hershey's memor-
andum of October 1967, which
recommended that anti-war and
anti-draft protesters be reclassi-

These positions were set foith
in response to a National stu-
dent Association query of the
four leading candidates on four
major issues of special interest
to students—the draft, lowering
voting age, higher education and
the role of youth in society.

New York Senator Robert Ken-
nedy wants a study of various pro-
posals for a random system,
drafting the youngest first, and
experimenting with a system of
alternative system. He also
called for rescinding a provision
of the 1967 Selective Service Act
which contradicted an earlier Su-
preme Court decision on consci-
entious objections. ,

On the draft, Vice President
Hubert Humphrey favors adop-
tion of the Fair and impartial
Random (FAIR) system proposed
by President Johnson last year
but rejected by Congress. it would
include a lottery and drafting a

Petition Gets Results:
Class Calendar Revised

A revised schedule for the
1968-69 year has been approved
by Clifton C. Theme, Vice-Pres-
ident of Student Affairs. On
March 2, 322 students signed a
petition requesting at least a
five day lntersession for next
year. The petition was passed
by Central Council 23-0-1.

lntersession has been changed
from three days in the old sche-
dule to eight days in the revised
schedule. One of the reasons for
this change was that many stu-
dents felt that the three day inter-
session was too hectic and did
not allow enough time to rest

It was felt that starting school
earlier or getting out later would
reduce the students chance of get-

such as holdingSaturday classes,

objections. Therefore fall and
