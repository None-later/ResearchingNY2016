Within this past semester the
belief that the disadvantaged per-
son should be given a more equal
chance to attend college has
spread throughout the more li-
beral academic communities of
our nation. There is no reason
why the universities cannot do
their part to try to break up the
vicious cycle of poverty.

if a student from a low income
area is able to receive good
higher education, the chance in-
creases that he may go back to
his home and help others to break
out of the almost castdike posi-
tion they hold in society.

Presently on this campus,
there are two programs that will
aid financially the “disadvant-
aged” student. One is the College
Opportunity Program, (GOP) and
the other is the Dr. Martin Luther
King Memorial Scholarship Fund.

The first program is sponsor-
ed by the University, but the sec-
ond is dependent entirely on pri-
vate contributions. This program
needs volunteers to solicit funds
from members of the University
Community. There is still time
for each student to do his part
in this campaign and support it
as he can.

Perhaps a couple of dollars
or a few hours seems insigni-
ficant, but every little bit helps
increase the scholarship. Be-
cause of the continuing nature of
the planned scholarship it is con-
ceivable that the effort that is
put in it today will be benefit-
ing someone twenty years from
now.

There have even been sugges-
tions that the University should
admit 200 students from the
ghettos and other disadvantaged
areas for the next academic year.

Although ideally this idea may
be what the young ghetto dweller
needs, the University may not be
able to provide enough facilities
for these students.

It would not be hard to give
all the individual attention need-
ed to start at the University to
the thirty students under the

Opportunity Program.But to take

on the task of guiding 200 stu-
dents in the first year of the
program would be taking a chance
of untold proportions, especially
when there are not enough staff
experience in this experiment.

We laud the efforts of the
University for COP and the in-
dividual members of the King
Scholarship committee. Perhaps
when our ability to meet the
demands of disadvantaged stu-
dents is adequate, we will be
able to admit more than 200
students; then, this University
can do its thing to end the poverty
that is too prevelant today.

The recent teach-in was a posi-
tive and progressive move in the
area of educational opportunity. in-
tellectual stimulation in the sphere
of world affairs is an extremely
important aspect of the University
and we think there should be more
of it.

Professors speaking at the
teach-in were specialists in their
fields and offered pertinent and
sometimes shocking information to
those participating in the teach-in.

Not only was the information im-
portant, but it was a welcome op-
portunity for casual dialogue with
the professors from the Univer-
sity who spoke at the teach-in.

Students should be able to meet
on a more personal intellectual ba-
sis outside the classroom, for this
is where the individual has a chance
to make himself and his ideas
known and discussed. There are
few occasions on which this level
of communication takes place. The
teach-in was an excellent start
in the improvement of faculty stu-
dent discussion on such a level.

information given at the lec-
tures was invaluable. It is impor-
tant for all of us to learn about
what is going on in Vietnam not
only because there are soldiers
there now, but also the war's ef-
fect on many aspects of American
life, including its intellectual as-
pect, is a topic of grave impor-
tance.

Can Change

The Office of Residences in the
last few weeks has shown a truly
remarkable and gratifying ability
to mould its planning around the
changing and demanding senti-
ments of the student body.

After considering the com-
plaints surrounding the originally
proposed change in the meal plan,
the Residence Office in conjunc-
tion with Food Service announced,
within a week, the adoption of the
much favored (according to the
LAAC poll) any 14 meal sche-
dule. This resulted not only in
the deletion of the contract food
section of the already Primed
housing cards, entailing book-
keeping problems, but also in

    

draft present the three gravest
problems the United States faces
today. it is our responsibility as
members of an intellectual com-
munity, to learn exactly what com-
plexities are involved in these
problems so that we may approach
them on a rational basis.

the opportunity for a student not
liking the finally adopted meal
schedule, to break his housing
contract.

The day after the any 14 meal
plan was announced, LAAC found
that this plan, too, was inade-
quate, and proposed still another
change. Again, happily, the Office
of Residences was willing to go
along with the new proposal, for
which action it is to be com-
mended. Office of Residences
again came through beautifully
when it was decided that Central
Council and LAAC elections
should be held this week.

in order to properly run these
elections, Residence lists Were
needed for each dormitory in
which upperclassmen were to be
living. By special work orders,
these lists were prepared ahead
of schedule so that the elections
could be held.

For its recent work in trying
to please and facilitate the func-
tioning of the student body and
its government, the Office of
Residences deserves commenda-
tion.

Stonybrook Students
Ask For Reforms

What began as a library sit-in at the
State University of New York at Stony-
brook on Wednesday in support of the
Columbia student strike, ended in the
presentation of a list of eight demands
for reform to the Stonybrook University
President Toll.

Chief among those were demands for
the removal of the so calle.’ maroon
force which polices the University, the
suspension of the DAPEC staff, a group
of former drug addicts who ha'a re-
cently conducted therapy sessions es-
pecially for those with drug haugups,
and for the obtaining of funds for a black
educational program.

Using the Columbia strategy, a group
of 23 students staged a sit-in in the
business office of the Stonybrook cen-
ter, demanding a meeting with Presi-
dent Toll. The crowd of demonstrators
soon swelled to more than 50; many of
that number were graduate students.

Toll agreed later in the afternoon to
meet with a committee composed of five
of the students and five faculty mem-
bers. At this confrontation, Toll sup-
ported the black educational program pro-
posal, but was vague on the other issues.

Among their eight points, the demon-
rators also asked Toll to make an
“unequivocal policy statement that po-

 

lice appear on campus only on C(iul'l
orders or if requested by the Univer-
sity” and to maintain in existancc and
operative condition the faculty-student
committee previously appointed “to re-
solve issues that will continue to arist-
in the growth and development of the
State University at Stonybrook."

After their initial meeting with 'l‘oll,
the demonstrators continued to occupy
the business office after being ordered
to leave by the President. When they
refused, Toll announced that they would
be referred to the student judiciary for
action. The demonstrators, according to
one Stonybrook reporter, seemed to llﬂVi‘
been relying on outside help in realizing
their demands, and seemingly felt that
the administration would call in the
Suffolk police to remove them from their
occupation of the business office.

Toll, however, indicated that only
University rules had been broken and that
the demonstrators would be dealt with
through the internal judiciary system.

Since many of the demonstrators wore
graduate students andthc student judiciary
to which they are being referred is an
undergraduate body, some question of the
propriety of their being tried in the
student court has been raised.

With Hubert Humphrey's an-
nouncement d candidacy, the 1961!
campaign is in full swing. The
battle lines are drawn: it is to
be either "more of the same”
with Humphrey or Nixon, or some
new answers with Robert F. Ken-
nedy. 1 find it somewhat apalling
that the Vice-President, the can-
didate running on the record of
an administration that totally fail-
ed, is far and away the front-
runncr for the nomination.

The Johnson-Humphrey Admin-
istration so shattered the nation
that the President could not even
run for re-election; Humphrey
is running on that record. And
yet, as one television commen-
tator put it, the candidate of the
Lawrence Welk crowd (and Les-
ter Maddox) may well carry the
day.

The case against Humphrey is
clear enough; i would not ex-
pect to find any thinking man
backing the Vice-President. 1968
must not be the year that we vin-
dicate the ultimate sellout.

The McCarthy movement is
something else again. in a sense
it can be discounted; Senator Mc-
Carthy shall be neither king nor
kingmaker.

But the McCarthy people have
a dream—the vision of the philo-
sopher-king, the hope for an apoli-
tical President—and they are not
likely to relinquish it without a
fight down to the wire. 1 can
see McCarthy as a fine alter-
nate but as a hero, never.

His supporters say that he is
a man above politics; that no
“machine” and no bosses back

McCarthy. This may be true but
I have not yet come to the con-
clusion that the lack of political
savvy is a virtue in the Presi-
dent of the United States. This
is the last thing we need today.

We desperately need a strong
President who can seize the ini-
tiatives from aconservative Con-
gress and a war-hungry military.
it is only through the exercise
and enjoyment of power by the
President that our cities shall
be saved and a newioreign policy
forged.

The McCarthy supporters see

his every act as smothered in
noble idealism. When McCarthy
slips, it only proves that he is a
citizen-politician or, better yet,
a poet surrounded by corrupt-
ing office holders.

The other day in the predomin-
antly black city of Gary, Indiana
Senator McCarthy addressed an
audience wearing a "Martin
Luther King, I Have a Dream"
Button. By his next stop, white
Hammond, Indiana, the button was
gone. There is nothing wrong with
McCarthy’s action outside of a
breach in taste. But it does
prove that like Kennedy and Nixon
and Humphrey and Rockefeller,
Eugene J. McCarthy is a poll-
tician. In fact he might well be
the best in the pack simply be-
cause he so well conceals this
fact which is so patent in the
very countenances of his fellow

office seekers.

The immediate controversy in
the wake of the rioting that re-
cently shook more than 100 Amer-
ican cities is not merely how to
prevent future outbreaks, but how
to stop the violence once it has
started. The present "soft
policy" which calls for the con-
tainment rather than the sup-
pression of violence has come
under harsh criticism —
and rightly so. It is just another
example of the recent trend of
coddling the criminal at the ex-
pense of the law-hiding citizen.

In Washington D.C. the police
and troops were under orders not
to use force against the wide-
spread looting. Let’s examine
the results of such restraint.
Looters, performing a criminal
act, escape unpunished. True,
the restrictions on force pre-
vented injury and death to the
rioters, but is this a virtue when
these people are deliberately and
knowingly making a mockery of
law and order? Obviously, the
citizen who stand to lose the

Senator McCarthy's main sell-
ing point is the fact that he was
the first Democrat to challenge
Lyndon Johnson. But today, this
is as irrelevant at Lyndon John-
son’s non-candidacy. McCarthy
must be judged on the issues.
lndianapolis' black leaders, after
hearing McCarthy immediately
endorsed Senator Kennedy.

One can only hope that the Me-
Carthy supporters will realize,
before it is too late, that they
must rally behind the Kennedy
banner. If they are sincere about
wanting a change in the direction
of American policy they will
make this move with some haste.
If not, they are the losers be-
cause once again their idealism
will be sacrificed. Perhaps Ro-
bert Kennedy can win without
them but the fact is that they
cannot possibly win without Ro-
bert Kennedy.

The day after Dr. King was
shot, in the ASP there appeared
another dthoao good,old-fash-
ioned cxhortaticns to "thank our
country for its blessings to us."
I wish to put on record by un-
compromising refusal to do so
on the grounds that this country
is NOT FREE.

The day after Dr. King, the
duocateof non-violence, was shot,
black people rebelled once more,
taking out their grief in acts of
violent destruction. On the news,
President Johnson proclaimed a
day of national mounting for Dr.
King, and sent troops into Wash-
ington to put down "disorder."
As of Saturday noon, April 8,
five black people had been killed
by federal troops. The nation’s
leaders do not mourn them.

I did not weep for Dr. King,
for his murder is no worse than

most are the merchants whose
stores are being destroyed and
robbed. What about their civil
rights? They pay taxes, aren't
they entitled to protection? Such
negligence on the part of the
government can have serious'im-
plications.

What is a merchant going to
do when he fails to receive ade-
quate protection, not because of
a lack of manpower, but because
the gov’t officials lack the gump-
tion to give it to him? Many
are arming themselves, deter-
mined to protect their own pro-

have? As long as the rioters
know that they will not be stop-
ped by the police, the looting
will continue. And as long as the.
merchants feel that they are not
being protected, they will con-
tinue to buy guns.

On April 15, Mayor Richard
Daley of Chicago gave his police

President Johnson’s speech of
March 31 accomplished more than
unifying the Democratic Party.
To no minor extent, it has a
great effect of unification on the
entire nation.

Peaceniks and peace-mongers
are smiling of late. They vis-
ualize Johnson’s bombing pause
as a victory for their cause, and
a satisfaction for their efforts.
They see, also, that the pro-
bability of the nomination of a
peace candidate and "real" lib-
eral in Chicago this summer
has greatly increased. So do I.
I seriously doubt the chances of
Vice-President Ilumphrey walk-

 

ing away with the nomination.

I was surprised that many of
the clean-cut, all-American,anti-
Communist (many other godly
adjectives may also appli’). loathe
Johnson for his decision. Iwel-
come it. Though it may prove me
wrong (which I seriously doubt),
the negotiations should prove a
point. Either a settlement, honor-
able to both sides will be reach-
ed, or the effort to negotiate
with the Commies will prove fu-
tile, once again.

the Spring Nationals, and illus—
trates a very important kind of
safety play.

The bidding was straightfor-

a balanced hand too good to open

raise to three.

The opening lead was ducked

jack, trying to get out of part-

the ace, because he feared a
heart shift, and played a spade
to dummy's ace.

hension of Dow. If I am incor-
rect, I will be the first to admit
it, and welcome it. I would be
extremely pleased to see rational
discussion emerge victorious and
supreme as a weapon in Vietnam.

Johnson’s intelligence in with-
drawing from the election amazes
me. It only took him fourand one-
half years to realize that being
a scapegoat for everything that
goes awry in our nation is no
thrilling experience. lie has made
a sensible decision from which
I'm sure he'll benefit.

As I started watching the
speech, resolved that I would
luckily be forced to forego the
antics of Tommie nnd Dickie
Smothers, I couldn’t help being
struck with awe at the sight of
my President's ears. I was con-
vinced that a combination ofJohn-
son and Schlitz would put me to
sleep.

Then LBJ came out with Biggie
Number One, the bombing pause,
and attempted for negotiations in
Vietnam. I was nmusedthatJohn-
son pulled this one out of his
bag of tricks. I was positive
that this speech would be is,
baled as the one designed to
win for him the Democratic no-
mination. lie would now be the
peace candidate, and Kennedy
and McCarthy would be forced
to go back to Washington to re-
pressnt their constituents.

After listening about a half-
hour to Johnson tell what a good
guy Robin Hood was, and how the
United States government should
imitate him, the President
blurted out that Biggie Number
two: “I do not seek, nor will
I accept. . ." Needless to say,
I Was surprised, but pleased,
realizing that now Richard Nixon
has the best chance

was immediately castigated by
the bleeding-heart liberals for_
daring to suggest something as
unheard of as using ample mea-
sures to enforce the law. Lind-
say and his ilk ranted and raved
about the rioters who would be
injured or killed. In my opinion,
if after the criminals in Chicago
know about Daley's policy and
still want to burn and loot, they
deserve nothing better than a
bullet. when you cause death and
destruction through arson, rob
stores, snipe at police and fire-
men etc., you should expect to
be apprehended by force. Daley’s
orders do not infringe on any-
one’s rights, nor are they ex-
cessively harsh. If you obey the
law you have nothing to worry
about, but if you decide to loot
and burn you face the conse-
quences.

The adoption of Daley's policy
appears to be a necessity rather
than a choice. More agressive
measures by the police is the
only way to preventcitizensfrom
arming themselves. Already
small businessmen and home-
owners are preparing to protect
their property andfamilies.

An 18 year veteran of the
Allen Park, Detroit Police Force
said, "If this keeps going it
will be like the frontier days—
everyone walking around with a
gun strapped to his hip. I’m
afrai'd that if some colored guy's
c : backfires, he'll get shot be-
fore he gets out of the neighbor-
hood.” The way to avert such
a situation is to give the average
citizen the assurance that he
will be protected. A continua-
tion of the "soft policy" towards
riots will only bring us one step
closer to anarchy and civil war;

on black people every day. They
have the freedom to fight rats
and roaches in white-owned tons-
monts, the freedom to spend
‘money on overpriced goods in
white-owned stores, to go to
school in white - controlled
schools. Their lives are blight-
cd from birth by this system,
and when they revolt they get
the white man’s "inwand order."
When they advocate non-violence,

they are shot, and ‘Dr. King’s .

is onlypart of a «too-year long
continuing crime against black
people. ‘

I come out :1 a typical white
working - class background, but
while anyone is not free to achieve
his potentialities, as I have been
free to achieve mine, I shall
NOT be grateful to the system
for my private advantages. I
shall instead continue to work
for social change, to uproot the
causes of black enslavement, to
support unconditionally both
black control of the black com-
munity and the right of black
people to achieve freedom by
any means necessary.

There is no middle ground in
this struggle; whites can no long-
er sit back and say, “What are
we to do when they riot?" or
"How can we not send in the
troops?" Nor can we go down
to the black communities as mis-
sionaries, a move equally pater-
nailstic.

We must remind whites that
after the troops have "restored
order," nothing is done to alie-
Vista the conditions that caused
the problem.

So far, only bandaids are ap-
plied to cancers, in the form of
so-called civil rights acts, etc.,
when nothing is done about the
conditions that cause Americans
to need totpass laws making it
a crime to treat one’s fellow
Americans, lndecently. The laws
are not enforced.

Racism, along with the war in
Vietnam, has its causes in the
fundamental nature of this so-
ciety. As long as the exploita-
tion of black people is profitable
to some people, racism will con-
tinue to exist. To eliminate
racism, one eliminates the
causes in the system, which re-
quires a fundamental reorganiza-
tion of this system. No one can
minimize the hugeness of such a
task, and one might well ask,
what about the meantime.

Until racism is gone, go ahead
with community projects,get bet-
ter balanced curricula into the
schools, establish programs to
help blacks enter State. But don't
think that you attack the very
bottom cause. You just make life
a little more bearable for black
pennin.

If you seriously want to and
racism you must first realize
that it has causes. Then you
treat the causes—by surgery if

necessary.
