McCarthy
Supporter

To the Editor:

Just a few ideas i would like
to share with you as to why i
think Sonabr Eugene L. Mo-
Carthy’e candidacy is important
and worthy of smart.

(i) The condoned andstrength-
ened support (1 Senator Mo-
Carthy for President helps to
enlarge the forum for the public
discussion of our programs and

tical exchange
porbiaitios for indepth analyses
of our present and future course

as a netiorn

(a) He offers us some alter-
natives to the present programs.
With respect to foreign policy,
this means an uncoraiitional ter-

vide a giant step toward resolv-
ing many of our other pressing
social concerns.

(3) lbs word change is not
missing from the Senator's vo-
cabulary. Hiswell-developodcon-
ceptim of chance makes him an
initiator, a. quality which lsabso
iuteiy indispensdtlo in a good
leader. i feel confident that be is
an honest, intelligent, imagin-
ative initiator and leader; these
qualities are very much needed

at this time.

(4) Finally, McCarthy's cm
didacy is important and worthy
of support as a roaifirmation of

values.

in short, i feel the candidacy
of Eugene l... McCarthy should
receive stronger support-snort

To the'Editor:

Answer to the MJ. Rosenberg
column of March 15th, 1960.

i suggest that the M..l. Rosen-
berg should take a few more his-
tory courses before he is givena
special column in a respectable
intellectual paper. He shctlld bet-
ter know that Arabs arenotbeeic-
oily anti-Jews, and to say thatthe
Arabs feed the Americans who

on anti-Semitic propogandois his-
torically and linguistically ridi-
wlous for ArabsareSemitestoo.
After all Mr. M.J. Rosenberg is
Judaism a religion or a race?

Who Is Right:

To the Editors:

1 am forced to admit, that
thanks to Mr. Sinon Abdulla, the
ASP has changed from a placid
to a controversial newspaper. i
now look forward every week to
reading Mr. Abduliah's hate col-
umn. This schaoldefinitely needs
such a column, as thestudentsdo
not harbor onwgh animosity. i
wonder how much Mr. Abduilah
and the other Arab students in
this country receive for spread-
ing their inane platitudes? Hehas
every right to demonstrate his
bitterness and resentment to-
wards lsrael, the Zionists and in-
evitably, Jews in general. 1 just
hope that Mr. Abdullah ap-
preciates the freedom of the
press offered at this school, be-
cause i doubt very much that
Jewish students at the American
University in Cairo (if there are
any) ' could propagandlze for
israel.

Aid for Law
Students

To the Editor:

The recent Selective Service
announcement concerning gradu-
ate school deferments means that
a number of pro-law college
seniors may defer their legal
education until completion oi
military service.

in order to give them a greater
sense of security about law school
entrance when they return, Case
Western Reserve Law School has
adopted a guaranteed deferred
admissions plan.

As always, students who are
drafted while in the law school
or who leave toenter the military
before completing their law
studies will have the right to

lir- . service. if a student should be

called to service in the middle
of a term, the law school will
-. contact his local board and re-
quest that induction be delayed
until completion of the semes-
ter’s work.

In the future any admitted ap-
plicant who indicates his inten-
tion to enter the law school but
who is drafted or who 'voluntarv'
enlists in the military before he
be'gins his law studies can be
certain about his admission to
the School upon completion of
his obligation.

Every effort will be made to
place him in the earliest enter-
ing class after his release from
the service. Only a brief reap-
plication need be filed. '

Roadmission will only be
denied in the case of conduct in
the interim period which reflects
adversely on one's moral
capacity to enter the legal profes-
sion.

The deferred admissions
policy will apply to those who
go into the service to fulfill
ROTC obligations. and to those
who enter reserve programs with
a six-month or shorter period of
active duty.

it is our hope and expectation
that a large number of present
college seniors will plan toenter
law school next fall. However,
we would like students to be
aware of the deferred admis-
sions optic.

Attitude
Important

,To the Editor:

1 am a white. 1 cannot speak
for the blacks nor can i speak
for the whites. l speak for my-
self. l realise the blacks have
undergone a great deal of abuse
by the whites for a very long
time — much too longa time.i
realise a great many whites are
bigots, hypocrite, racists. l'm
very very sorry about this and
shall continue to attempt to
rectify it. The blacks are im-
patient and rightly so. The blocks
are becoming violent and wrmgly
so. The white have become vio-
lent and wrongly so.

What is needed? Humane, ra-
tional (Christian, if you will)
thought. Will laws abolishing
racism work? Not alone. They
require the willing honest sup
port of everyone. A change in
attitude is needed. Whose? Every-
one's. Mainly the whites? Be-
cause it is evident that some
change is needed and there are
more whites than blacks. Hence
“mainly.”

What can the white do? He
can examine his own conscience
and attempt to blot out any pre-
judices he finds there. Then he
can go into his community and
start helping other whites see all
mankind as their brothers. What
can the black do? He can stop
for a moment screaming “bigot,
hypocrit, racist" and help. To
stand and tell the ignorant that
they are ignorant aids no one.

want? Hannah More said, "if
i wished to punish my enemy,
i should make him hate some-
body." Do you want me to
apologize being born a white?
1 cannot speak without the words
coming from the mouth of a
white. 1 apologize for all of the
injustices l have allowed to exist
in our society.

Violence on the parts of the
blacks or the whites will ulti-
mately serve no one any good. if
the blacks say that because the
whites have so long abused them
that now we should give them

Criticized:

To the Editor:

Your newspaper could have
handled the Arab - lsraeli con-
flict in a much more dignified
manner. For six weeks you have
printed many letters which
shouldn’t have appeared in print
in the first place. A school news-
paper, when letters are limited
to 300 words, cannot handle
such a situation in the best man-
ner possible.

it should'not expect to do so
either. The ASP is not the place
where two sides should battle.
For six weeks, the student body
has seen Zionist, Anti-Zionist,
Anti - Sometic, and anti-Anti-
Semotic statements.

it has become absurd, and!
request that you not print any
further articles on this subject.
i do suggest, that if both Zion-
ists and Anti-Zionists wish to
debate, then let this be a pub-
lic debate. if the ASP wishes
to be involved, perhaps it can
sponsor a series of debates on
the Arab - lsraeli conflict.

To be more mature, the ASP
must change its present policy,
and it should learn how and

Being as i haven't been suc~

seem to be any great loss for
me to sacrifice one of my pre-

my co-author is not responsible

For many years, students
at this university have been some-

fantastic rate. ,

Suddenly the thought occurs:
What the hell are we doing?

Why?

it is disheartening to suddenly
realize that you have been wast-

We have been greatly con-

around this school have been all

have written, worked like a dog,
sneaked around, researched, in

to change things for the better
in this school. 1 have been proud
of some of my modest accom-

We don't have the money to
put most of the recommenda-

Has a committee been set up

Nope. Just theory, no action.

7 Maggie Diets

 

 

in past weeks, and in the next
few months, quite a number of
us seem to be faced with imme-
diately crucial choices. Several
of these choices involve notori-
ous happenings called elec-
tions. '

.We've recently elected people
under the titles of Class Of-
fice, MYSKANIA, LAAC, Cen-
tral Council, Alumni Board,
Choice '68.,and fraternity and
sorority officers. Observation
here points to the fact that
Choice '68 and the fraternity
and sorority elections are the
most interest - provoking. Choice
'68 aroused interest because its
concerns involve all of us,’and
the fraternal elections arouse
interest because all involved
are concerned.

So really, it’s possible to par-
ticipate in the all - encompas-
sing or specially - :elected type
of choice. it is a hopeful as-
sumption that most members of
the 1946 post-war "baby boom"
will participate in the Presi-
dential election in November be-
cause of both natures of choice.

Then too, there is a special
selective element which doesn't
seem to allow much room for
choice, the draft. The choices
are largely indirect, made by

others for us, before us.’ The'
immediate individual choices in
this situation are now widespread
common knowledge, available to
anyone who seeks the informa-
tion. Yet even here, there is a

most important, most pervasive .

element of choice; it involves
what we're supposed to be do-
ing here, at an educational in-
stitution. That choice is doing
the justifiable thing in your
own situation which may make
someone eise’s choices better.
Any choice which doesn't bring
immediate results is the most

difficult, yet most valuable to .

make.

Of course, there is the annual
senioritis dilemma of not know-
ing where to go from here. The
Graduate has already made a‘mint
in the Albany - Schenectady -
Troy area alone. A multitude
of underciassmen in their soph-
omoric state have commented
lately, "i'm glad l'm not grad-
uatingl" Time, place and situa-'
tionai variables can justify any
attitude, but who wants to re-
main a fetus forever?

Choices involve bewildering
but very useful confrontations,
but it seems that no matter how
you face them, wc’repretty lucky
to have them.
