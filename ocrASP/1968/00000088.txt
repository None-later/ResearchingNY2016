Shankar Movie
Being Produced

"Messenger Out Of The East"
a dramatic full length color film,
is currently being produced about
the indian classical musician,
Ravi Shankar.

The film will seek to explore
both his enormous success inthe
eastern world and the difficult
task that has become uniquely
his — that of bridging the two
divergent cultures oi East and
West. In a concept that looks
to the source, the film will try
to discover the meaning of Ravi
Shankar himself ——- a meaning
locked deep within the culture
and traditions of Indian music,
art, philosophy, religion andlife.

The film will show how music
is far more than music in
India. It will explore the mystical
union of music and religion in-
extricably entwined in the daily
life and seasonal cycle of the
people and the land. it will point
to the significance of a musical
sound for every movement, for
every ceremony, for every mood,
birth, death and marriage.

"Messenger Out Of The East"
is being shot in Eastman color
by a British-American crew on
locations throughout India follow-
ing the main threads of the fabric-
that of the ancient and unique
relationship between Guru and
Shyshya, master and disciple.
The film will show the joy and
zeal on the part of the Guru in
devoting his time and energies
.to the teaching oi the sacred
traditions reciprocated by the
devotion and discipline oi the
Shyshya in dedicating his life to
learning and his Guru.

AL RIRT CONCERT

 

Vilma

by Paulo Comordello

 

 

Al Hirt and his jazz group,
appearing at the RPI fieldhouse
last Saturday evening, certainly
brought down the house. Their
performance was lively, spirit-
ed, sparkling . . . in short,
fantastic!

The group consisted oi five
members — Al Hirt, trumpet;
Joseph "Pee Wee" Spitelera,
clarinet and sax; Ellis L. Mar-
salis, piano; Wayne De Villier,
organ; and Frederick Staehle,
drums.

They did favorites like"Cotton
Candy," "Java,""Monday-Mon-
day," "Sugar Lips," "Girl
Watchers," and "Yesterday,"
which oi course ieatured Allet.
Throughout the concert, each
member performed as a solo.
"Pee Wee," Al tlirt's sidekick,
did a New Orleans blues number
with a swanky beat. Judging from
the ovation he received (it was
like Arthur Godfrey’s Talent
Scouts applause meter), Al Hirt
will give him his raise.

Wayne DeVlllier presented an
exciting arrangement of
"Slaughter on 10th Avenue,"
which was pleasingly different.
Ellis Marsalis, the pianist, gave
two magnificent performances—
"Autumn Leaves," an all time
audience favorite, and "Bess,
You Is My Woman Now," from
Gershwin's Porgy and Bess.

State Quadrangle
Plans Fall Films

State Quad Productions, head-
ed by Franklin Levy. Laurence
D. Pearson, and David Ridge,
has turned the State Quad Flag
Room into a movie theatre for
the weekends.

Cinema Study Break was a
weekend program last semester
which allowed the members of
the University to take a short
study break before finals and
relax while viewing a film.

During this ‘ films

It is really difficult to say who
stole the show - but a close
contender was the 2Lyear-old
drummer, Fred Staehle, doing
Brubeck's "Take Five.” He held
the audience literally captivated
throughout his number, and no
one knew whether to break into
enthusiastic applause sporadical-
ly, or whether to silently savor
every delightful second of his
creativity.

Aside from the musical talent,
the group had a lot oi a1 dience
appeal. Al Hirt has a really good
sense of humor. His puns were
very enjoyable. and he didn't
overdo it with the jokes. He and
"Pee Wee" hammed it up
throughout the program, which
was pretty enjoyable.

it’s really true that Al Hirt
is "the King” — he puts out a
concert with all he's got.

 

 

WES MORTOGOME RY

Reverie

by Walt Doherty

 

 

“Wes Montgomery: A Day in
the Life" on A&M records has
got to be one oi the best albums
in a long while.

Montgomery plays a guitar and
has a 30-piece orchestra backing
him up, but the amazing thing is
that the songs he plays are ar-
ranged so that the orchestra
never overpowers Montgomery’s
guitar — it is the lead instru-
ment and played that way. The
orchestra provides a background
for Montgomery's superb musici-
anship. It's refreshing to find
someone with the taste to use a
little restraint today rather than
overwhelming a person with
sound and electronic tricks.

Montgomery uses this sort of
restraint. He provides popular
tunes in an arrangement suited to
the guitar and in particular tohis
guitar.

"A Day in the Life” isthe only
song in which the orchestra has
more than just abackground role,
but considering the type of tune
this is, it's understandable that
something different he done with
it. Montgomery's arrangementof
this captures the mood of the
Beatle original (if that's pos-
sible) even without words, That
quite frustration of life is cap-
tured in the calm, but still mov-
ing, presentation.

Also on the album are “ When

"Windy" is the song that
prompted me to buy the record.
Montgomery’s recording of the
song is on the jukebox in the
Rathskeller. He doesacommend-
able job with LeslieGore's"Call-
iornia Nights" and the Beatle's
"Eleanor Rigby" receives treat-
ment which it deserves. Although
the rhythm is quite regular, there
is still that free swinging ele-
ment of Jazz (which pervades the
whole album actually).

"Willow Weep for Me" lsdone
slow and easy, it conjures up :1
pictures of a warm, lazy summer
day when it's too hot to do any-
thing but strum on a guitar.

The rest of the album is equally
as good as the tunes mentioned
here. The jazz element of Mont-
gomery's playing is a definite
addition to the recording, with-
out it the album wouldn'tbe worth
what it is. His free style, yet
kept within controlled rhythm,
makes this a jazz album which
even people who hate jazz will
like.

New Peanuts Book:
A Joy To Read

by Harriet Lieser

"You're Something Else, Char-
lie Brown" is the latest in the
line of cartoon books by Charles
Schulz featuring the Peanuts
characters. Present, as always,
we find the zany and amusing cast
led by the one and only Charlie
Brown. Charlie Brown is the
sensible but, somehow, "he-er-
do-well" fellow who we find, in
this book, refusing to write to
his pen-pal in pencil but manag-
ing to squirt his pen's ink all
over him.

We also see the insecure and
philosophical Linus who comes
to the conclusion, after pulling
.his hand out of the refrigerator,
that "a thumb tastes better at
room temperature." Crazy
Snoopy is back, as aloof as ever,
and continues, in spare time be-
tween baseball games, to hunt
out his arch enemy — the Red
Baron. Lucy is her same dom-
inating, egotistical self. She is
repulsed at the thought of kiss-
ing Snoopy and considers Charlie
Brown, as always, an"Old Block-
head."

In "You’re Something Else,
Charlie Brown," Charles Schulz
takes us through the usual base-
ball season fiasco of Charlie
Brown's team, an unsuccessth
summer at camp, Lucy’s psy-
chiatric help center, Snoopy’s
perpetual search for the Red
Baron, and many other enjoy-
able incidents. it is delightful
to read and a great way to free
one's mind of the Roman Empire
and quadratic equations.

In closing, l'd like you all to
join me in the thought that one
day soon . . . Snoopy will catch
the Red Baron.

SOME RECENT MOVIES

Bo Widerberg's "Elvira Madi-
gan” looks unnecessarily bad:
the absence of directorial imag—
ination seems all the worse be-
cause we aren't aware. of the
extensive folk tradition that sur-
rounds the story. The Swedish
ballad runs: "A young lieutenant
-nobiy horn - ran away- from wife
and children with Elvira Madi-
gan.” The couple share an idyllic
summer; the lieutenant refuses to
get a job; faced with starvation.
they commit suicide. In print
this looks bad, but Widerberg
makes it look worse on film.

First, it is not by a long shot
"the most beautiful film ever
made." As I’ve said before, this
is the day of striking cinemato-
graphy —— you rarely see badly
photographed film — but what
counts is what the stylistic pret-
tiness projects. Some of the shots
in "Elvira Madigan” do indeed
have a Renolrlan loveliness. but
they quickly become a series of
vacuous Life-magazine stills.
There is much more true cine-
matic beauty in, say “The Virgin
Spring,” (another film with a folk-
tale as its source —- but what a
difference!) because Bergman
has constructed each shot not
merely for its own sake but for

purposes of revealing characters
and theme and advancing the
story. Sometimes this happens
in "Elvira Madigan," but not
nearly often enough.

To make matters worse, we
aren’t told of the folklore that
surrounds the story and Wider-
berg injects no rhythms or im-
agery that might visually approxi-
mate folk convention. instead.
viewed from arealistic angle, the
story grows steadily slllier(we
even watch the couple desperate-
ly gobbling grass) and grinds on
to a sudden stop. Widerberg might
have saved the film by giving the
lovers some substance as char-
acters or by rendering the
peasant society more hilly. As it
is, the couple are standard screen
lovers (there's even that obliga-
tory slow-motion romp through
high grass). and only glimpses of
the society’s atmosphere come
through. Maybe "Elvira Madi-
gan” shouldn't have been export-
.d, but l’m convinced that abetter
director could have created
something. Bo Widerberg,
though, isn’t the man.

of the cast are uninspiring: Kier
Dullea is as wooden as his axe-

still affected with her facial St.

a lovely brunette. can bewatched
without embarrassment. (i wish
they'd make a movie with her
alone in it.) Bill Fraker's photo-
graphy paints the scene’s wx
trlness well, and there’s some
momentarily effective cutting.ln-
cidentally, if you’re going to see
" The Fox“ because of those
three erotic scenes, you'll be
disappointed —— they’re brief,
chilly, and dull.

"No Way to Treat a Lady” is
a party for Rod Steiger fans and
a bore for anybody else. it can't
decide if it wants to be a comedy
or a serious thriller, and so falls
as either. (There's nothing wrong
with mixing genres and moods,
but it's dangerous to try it if you
lack the daredevil skill of a
Hitchcock or a Truffaut.) Steiger
races through a series of clever
impersonations (Irish priest,
German plumber, faggot, cop)
that are impressive, i guess, but
which certainly conceal the
depths he's capable of. A good
thriller should be thrilling, but
director Jack Smighi can’t con-
struct even conventional sus-
pense stuff.

part of Explosion '68 festivities.
heading off in the series of three
concerts was the Cary Burton
Quartet. Hailed as the greatest
inﬂuence on vibes since Milt
Jackson, young Burton's music
is a unique juxtaposition of rock
and jazz elements. Burton’s cur-
rent group has two L.P.'s on the
RCA Victor label: "The Time
Machine," and "Duster." They
appeared in the Campus Center
garden on May 2.

Tonight, in the new gym,flutist
Herbie Mann's septet will play
opposite Clark Terry's big band.
Mann is most well known for his
fiery Afro-Latin percussive ef-
fects combined with the sound of
a variety of exotic flutes. Follow-
ing Mann, trumpeter Clark
Terry's big band will hold forth
for the second half of the con.
cert. In the short time since the
band's inception, ithas generated
excitement from musicians and
critics alike. Clark Terry will
probably be familiar to late-
evening television viewers be
cause he is a regular member
of the "Tonight Show" orchestra
where he occasionally displays
his humorous talent for mumb-
ling song lyrics.

Charles Lloyd and Dizzy

'Gillespie will be the attractions
for the Saturday evening concert,
the final in the festival. Charles
Lloyd's quartet won national fame
last summer, after a series of
highly acclaimed appearances at
the Fillmore Auditorium in San
Francisco, where his best-selling
album “Love-In" was recorded
in concert. A second wave of
publicity showered Lloyd’s group
early in November when they
were cheered by thousands in

Moscow despite adverse prepar-
formance announcements by gov-

start!

ernment officials regarding
Lloyd's performance.

Rounding out the Festival's
roster for Saturday night is an
appearance by Dizzy Gillespie's
quintet. Little can be said about
Gillespie to add to the acclaim
has inspired for the past twenty
years except to mention that he
continues to lead a volitile com-
bination of superb musicians ina
remarkably cohesive unit.

Tickets for the Friday and
Saturday evening concerts may
be obtained today in the Campus
Center. Tickets will also be said
each night at the door. The prices
are: $3.50 for a combination
ticket for both Friday and Satur-
day nights; student tax only. For
either night the price is $2.50
with student tax; and $4.00 each
flight without student tax.

Richardson Houses
Summer Theatre

Arena Summer Theatre of the
University will be performing
proscenium style during the 17th
consecutive season this summer.
Complications of space and
scheduling have prevented the
theatre from occupying its
familiar home in Page Gym-
nasium or its home-to-be in the
Performing Arts Center. Instead,
Arena will operate in the studio
theatre, Richardson 291.

For this season three produc-
tions are planned, and they will
be chosen from the works of the
following authors: Samuel
Beckett, Maz Frisch, Jean An-
nouilh, August Strindberg, and
several newer dramatists, James
Saunders, Sam Shepard, and Sla»
womir Mrozek.

Following its policy of many
years, Arena will have open au-
ditions for all residents of the
area in late May or early June.

 

 

THE JIM HENDRIX EXPERIENCE

Fourth Time Around

gor Koroluk

 

a performer who must be seen to
be fully appreciated at his con-
cert in Troy, April 19.The sheer
physical drive and creativity he
possesses can never be cut into
wax — man, he is great. His
physical mannerisms and con-
tortions could be construed as
gross, but somehow they aren’t;
they reinforce the entire idea
of his music — raw, basic sensu-
allty.

Although all eyes were on lien-
drix, we realize that "The Ex-
perience" would not be complete
without the excellent talents of
the bassman and drummer.
Hendrix has molded a fantastic
music machine, combining his
enormous talents on guitar (any-
one who can make music by
smashing a guitar againstan amp
has to be the best l’ve ever
seen), and his instinctive show-
mnnship. along with two of the
finest sidcmen you might ever
find.

The ’I‘roy Armory has the worst
acoustics of any place in which
i have ever heard a concert.
“The Experience" proved their
greatness by overcoming thchor-
ri-ndous echo, while lili! "Soft

invptness by being dominated by

Jlml Hendrix proved ﬁlmsel? this is a good, as well as imag-

inative goal, but it requires
musical skill and an ability to
control sounds completely —
talents which the group pitifully
lacked.

I've acquired some very ex-
cellent recordings since my last
column and would like to sum-
marize a few of them. In the
field of hard rock there is a
group called "Iron Butterfly"
with an album under the very
misleading title "Heavy." They
don't come on as strong as say
the “Blue Cheer” or “Amboy
Dukes" and, in fact, manage to
achieve some very delicate,
~eautiful sounds. Their chief
asset is their organist, who
makes the sound distinctive. Es-
pecially [the are his baroque in-
troductions to “Rossersian” and
"Get Out Of My Life, Woman”
as well as the complete "iron
Butterfly Theme." A very nice
album, with a different approach
to hard rock.

I’hll Ochs has shown sheer
genius in " Pleasures Of The liar—
bar," He has questioned his own
brand of cynicism and has be-
come loss direct, without losing
any of his brilliant sarcasm. His
lyrics are great and beautifuland
funny. but the brilliance of the
album is in the arrangements and
use of orchestration. Host ex-
amples are in the title song, a.
study in lyrical romanticism, and
u. "Crucifixion," with 1:; re-
markable use ofdissonance. This
album is one of the finest, most
thorough. "folk" records ever
produced.
