A barrage of goals by Steve
Jakway, Mike Barlotta and Jim
Flannlgan led the unbeaten Al-
bany State lacrosse club to a
19-3 slaughter of an outgunned
Cobleskill A&T team in the first
home lacrosse game last Satur-
day.

Playing before a good-sized
crowd, which was quite vocal,
the State stickmen held quarter
margins of 4-0, 10-1 and 15-3
in sweeping to their second
straight triumph. ,

The first quarter was a wild
melee, with both teams showing
their nervousness for the first
eight minutes. Then State at-
tackman Jim Flannlgan went on
a scoring rampage, firing in four
goals within a 6 minute span.
Walt Quilllnan picked up an as-
sist, as did Steve Jakway.

The second period was a two-
man show, as Jakway and little
co-captain Mike Barlotta con-
tinued to pour goals past the
Cobleskill goalie. Jakway fired
four goals, getting an assist from
Bruce Sand on one. Barlotta
whipped in two counters, one on
beautiful breakaway from the
faceoff. The visitors finally
broke the scoring ice in this
period as Schleigle scored unas-
sisted.

Despite single goals by Guzzo and

Winterton for Cobleskill, the Al-
bany club continued to build its
lead. Bariotta fired in two more
goals, with an assist from Kev
Sheehan on the second. Jakway
hit one, Andy Hotchberg scored
once, and Sand assisted Mark
Werder on his only goal of the
day.

The Great Danes continued to
pull away in the final period,
with Sand getting one goal and
assisting Jakway on another.Ken
Turow and Bariotta also hit to
close out the day's scoring.

Jakway led all scoring with 6
points, all on goals. Mike Bar-
lotta had 5 goals and Jim Flan-
nigan had four. Bruce Sand picked
up 4 points on one goal and three
assists, and Hotchberg, Werder
and Turow had a goal each.

In the first game of the sea-
son, Mark Werder’s 7 goals and
3 assists led the Albany club toa
{4-13 overtime triumph over a
powerful Union College frosh
team.

Next on the slate for the la-
crosse club is a game with the
tough, experienced Tri-Clty La-
crosse Club. The game is
scheduled as a part of Explosion
’68, and will be played on the

and finished fifth in a field of eleven.

Albany got its only first
from the distance medley
relay team, which includes
an 880, a 440, a three-quar-
ter mile. and a mile.

Don Beevers, Mike Noian,Tom
Mills and George Rolling com-
posed the team, which won due
to a fine effort by Rolling. Rall-
ing took the baton 50 yards be-
hind two other runners, but run-
ning an intelligent race, he grad-
ually were both of them down and
won the race by 10 yards.

For this effort Rolling was
voted outstanding runner of the
meet. It was the first time arun-
her not on the winning team was
so honored.

On Saturday the club won a very
close meet against Harpur and
Hartwick, scoring 67 points to
Hartwick’s 62 and Harpur's 55.
Mike Nolan set a new Albany
440 record, with a time of 51.6,
and Larry Frederick broke his
own two mile record with a time
of 9:53.7. Depth was shown in
the half mile, as Dick Horowitz
was second in 2:03.4, Frank My-
ers was third in 2:04.6, and Joe
McAndrews was fourth in 2105.0
Albany also got first from: Don
Myers who ran a 4:32.8mile,Ba-
sll Morgan who ran the 100 yard
dash in 9.9 and Saul Moshenberg
who went 42’ 03-4" in the triple
jump.

Second -p1ace finishers for Al-
bany included Frederick in the
mile, Don Beevers in the shot-
put, and the javelin, Horowitz in
the 880, and Moshenberg in the
long jump.

Unfortunately two injuries re-
sulted from the meet, as Mor-
gan and Mathias both pulled mus-
cles. Morgan should recover
soon, but Mathias is expected to
be out for the season.

Last Wednesday the track club
easily defeated Plattsburgh. Stef
Smlgiel was the stand out for Al-
bany, as he took four events.
placing first in the discus, the
javelin, the shot-put and the high
jump. Basil Morgan also came
through with a very strong per-
formance, as he won the 100 and
the 220, anchored the 440 relay,
and ran a 50-second 440 to an.
chor the mile relay.

The track club's next meet is
at Hariwick on Wednesday March
8. The meet promises to be a
close one.

Last Ssturday the Albany
booters took the field for their
second spring engagement.Union
College and Hudson Valley were
invited to play in a round robin,
half hour games. Playing this
spring to rebuild and strengthen
last year's squad, the Danes met
Union in the opener.

Both teams started slowly, but
Albany held the upper hand
throughout. The Great Danes
started slowly, but finally settled
down and play well,penetrating
the Union defense frequently,
while the defense showed it's
strength by holding Union to only
seven scoring attempts. How.
ever, the bell never seemed to
find the net: for either club,
and the game ended in a score.
