This past week the, University Athletics Council's

report on undergraduate intercollegiate athletics was
released by President Collins. The council had been
empowered by Collins to formulate a rationale for
intercollegiate sports, and to propose a program for
their future development at the University.

The report starts with a well written rationale,
that emphasized the benefits of intercollegiate compe-
tition to both the individual participants, and to the
University as a whole. One interesting point was the
idea that an excellent sports program can bring the
University into the public eye, and thus put the Univer-
sity in a better position to emphasize its other outstand-

ing aspects.

With regard to future development, the report pro-
posed a wide, but gradually phased expansion of the
University's entire athletic program. Of primary in-
portance is the call for the establishment of football
at the earliest feasible date. The plan calls for the for-
mation of a club in the fall of 1969, with three years
of club football, to be followed by varsity football in
the fall of ’73. Other sports mentiOned for possible
varsity status include: lacrOsse, track and field, swim-
ming, gymnastics, fencing, crew. squash, water polo,
ice hockey, rifle and volleyball.

One of the biggest problems in implementing this
proposed expansion is that there are only limited op-
portunities for expanding the coaching staff. The re-
port did, however, call for the hiring of three new
men for ’69-70, thus enabling the formation of club

football and varsity lacrosse.

Another major point of the report. and one which
was given considerable emphasis was the idea of con-
ference membership. No conference is specifically men-
tioned in the report, and it is difficult to come up with
a conference that fulfills the requirements (not too far
away. similar entrance requirements, and similar level
of athletic competition). but the idea itself is certainly

a good one. Conference

membership would be es-

pecially beneficial with regard to scheduling, for at
the present time our independent status leaves us in a
particularly difficult position in this respect.

Another problem, that of recruiting, is also given only
minor consideration. The report reiterates the posi-
tion of the Trustees of the State of New York that no
athletic scholarships shall be given. it then goes on to
recommend: open communications between admissions
and the athletic department (with regard to academically
qualified students), and a flexible policy with regard to
campus employment opportunities.

A11 in all the report is good in that it strongly rec-
ommends that the sports program expand with the Uni-
versity. but it fails in that it more or less bypasses
the problems of effectively facilitating these recom-
mendations. The report would be more realistic if it
called for the establishment of some means of facili-
tating recruiting, and made more definite recommen-
dations with regard to scheduling.

F rosh Linksters Win

by Joel Vollnsltl

The freshmen golfers opened
their 1988 season successfully
by winning two of their first
three matches. in the season
opener against New Paltz, the
frosh won a 3-2 match which
could have gone either way. Lar-
ry Clark and Marty Benjamin
won their individual matches ea-
sily, while Joel Volinski won
his on the first hole of sudden
death. Both Tom Patterson and
Steve Bookin lost their matches
on the last hole.

Albany split in a tri - meet
against Hudson Valley CC, and
Cobleskill. Hudson Valley. mob-
ably the strongest team the free
will meet this year, won every

possible point except one. The
Albany frosh lost to Hudson Val-
ley 7-0, but beat Cobleskill
6-1. This meet was strictly
medal play, or total strokes. Low
scores for the frosh were posted
by first man Tom Patterson and
second man Joel Volinski, each
shooting 81.

The courses that the frosh
have played this year have been
extremely tough, but if they ex-
pect to continue to win matches,
these scores must come down.

There are five matches left
for the fresh. This week they
played Albany Pharmacy and Si-
ena at their home course, Mag-
regor.

 ‘Spll‘tsiWith Pots am '

Remaich With Siena Today

The Albany State baseball nine won 'one and lost two in action last weekend. The
Great Danes fell to Siena and Jack LeMay on Friday by _a 5-0 count. On Saturday they
bounced back to score a decisive 11-2 win over Potsdam in the first game of a twin.
bill. However, Potsdam came back to eel: out a 2-1 win in the seven inning second
game. Today the Great Danes will be hosting Siena, and will be out to avenge their 5-0

loss.

in the first Siena game
Albany outhit the lndians 6-5
but Siena made its hits count,
while the Great Danes were
unable to come up with clutch
blows aganst Siena's LeMay.

Jim Rourke and Denny Elkin
had three hits apiece in the
Great Danes 13-bit attack against
Postdam. Rourke rapped a sin-
gle, double and triple, while
Elkln had a triple and two sin-
glee.

Albany pushed 5 runs across
in the third. Rourke doubled and
Elkin singled driving in Rourke,
Hurler Cas Galka walked, and
Jim Sandy singled to left for
one. Jim Murley then singled for
another run, Torn Decker walked
and Joe St. Onge then singled
up the middle for the final two
runs of the inning.

in the fourth Elkin tripled and
scored on an infield out, and in
the fifth Rourke tripled home
two more. Galka then rode home
on a comfortable lead.

in the second game Rich Pat-
rei started for Albany and pitched
well, allowing only two hits in
the first five innings. Unfortu-
nately the Bears used their hits
well scoring once in the fourth
and once in the fifth, and those
two were enough. Albany’s only
run came in the bottom of the
fifth, when Murley singled, stole
second, moved to third on abalk,
and scored on a wild pitch. Al-
bany threatened in the seventh,
but Potsdam's Dick staab bore
down and thwarted the rally.

After 10 games, the official
statistics showed Jim Rourke as
the team's highest hitting regu-
lar. Rourke then sported a .345
average, he also led the team
in total bases, stolen bases and
RBIs. Denny Elkin was next
among the regulars, as his hot
bat produced eight hits in four
games last week, and upped his
average to .286. Jack sinnett
and Jim Sandy were also doing
well as they stood at .278 and
.265 respectively.

The pitching statistics show-
ed Cas Galka. with a 2.16 ERA,
but a 1-2 won-lost record, while
George Webb had a 2.82 ERA
and a 3-1 record. The Great
Danes record at this writing
was 4-6, but they played a home
doubleheader with New Paltz
on Tuesday.

  

ALBANY STATE C0-CAPTAIN JIM MURLEY ASHES for

 

the plate in its first game of theGreot Danes doubleheader

with Potsdam last Saturday.

Frosh Nine Falls 8-3 _
Errors Prove Costly

Rockland Community College's
baseball nine proved to be too
much for the Albany State fresh-
men last Saturday, as they send
the Great Dance to their third
defeat in as many games, by a
9-3 count.

Rockland scored once in the
first, but Albany came back with
two in the second. Jim Lee '1ed
off with a walk, stole second,
moved to third on a passed ball,
and then scored on HowieSmith's
sacrifice fly. Then, with twoouts
A1 Herzlich and Ron Spratt both
drew bases on balls, they moved
to second and third on a balk,
and Hersllch then scored on Eliot
Nirenberz's infield single.

Rockland Too Strong

Rockland, however, came back
strong, scoring twice in the third,
once in the fourth, and twice in
both the fifth and sixth. Albany

came up with its final run in the
top of the ninth, but it was to no
avail. The' run scored when Herz-
lich walked, Spratt singled, and
Herzlich then scored when the
Rockland shortstop threw thebsll
away on an attempted DP.

‘ Smith started for Albany, work-
ed the first 5 2-3 innings. and
was tagged with the loss. Bob
Friedlander came on in relief
and finished up. Both hurlers
were the victim of poor fielding
support as the frosh committed
8 errors. The frosh were also
bothered by spotty hitting as they
managed only four hits as com-
pared to 8 for Rockland.

The baby Great Danes travel-
led to New Paltz on Tuesday,
and they will be traveling to
Siena today. They will then re-
turn home tomorrow for a 2:00
p.m. encounter with Cortland.

Golfers Fall To Potsdam,
Top New Paltz, Oneonta

Bill Prendergast, Gary Tur-
ton and Ray McCloat all won

their matches in last Friday's

match with Potsdam, but Pots-

dam linksters took the other

three matches, and also won

total score, thus gaining a tight
4-3 win. Prendergast, who plays

in the fifth spot for the Great

Danes was medalist for Albany

with a fine score of 80. The
loss drops Albany's record back

to 4-3.

Last Tuesday the Great Danes
scored an impressive double vic-

tory over Oneonta and New Paltz

topping Oneonta 5-2 and shut-
ting out New Paltz 7-0. Medal-
ist for Albany was first man
Ray McCloat who shot an 83.
THREE DOUBLE WINS

In this match McCloat, Craig
Luther, and Turton all scored
double victories, while Prender-
goat and Dave Breiter split their
matches, with Prendergast losing
out in a playoff against his
Oneonta opponent.

Last Saturday the Great Danes
traveled to Hamilton, where they
were over whelmedbya 8-0 count.
Again it was Ray McCloat who
led the _way for Albany shooting
an excellent 82.

The Hamilton meet was scored
on a different basis then the
Albany's home meets. Hamilton
scores on a match play basis,
which means that the match is
scored hole by hole, rather than
on the more normal overall total
stroke basis.

DANES TOP LEMOYNE ~

in the LeMoyne match, played
two weeks ago today, the Great
Danes scored an easy 8-2 win,
with Ray McCloat leading the

. .way- with. .a -low. score of 81.

The linksters will be in ac-
tion today when they will travel
to Utica for a match that was
originally scheduled for May 17,
their next home match will be
Monday May 6 with Siena.

Concerning the war in Vict-

said. "if there is 11 pence meet-

Racism. Brinkley feels. is the
worst problem the United Slates
is facing today. Racism is wide-
spread and hznl bccn throughout
human history.

Brinkley said that rccism is not

is unusual.
