'Strummed In. “

Twanged Out"

‘Twas Gentle, and the
students ‘ ,
Did frolic nimbly on the
grass

All trying were the cele-
brants, an

danced and sang en masse

This. year Gentle Thursda
came in with strums of a fol
guitars and went out with twangs
of electric uitars. Most students
didn’t cele rate the day except
for a few who costumed and
painted themselves in garish
garb.

Earlier in the day. a group of
fifty sang folk songs on the Cam-
us Center lawn. The real cele-
ration of the day 'was the paint-
ing of faces. arms. legs and
chalking of the snack bar walls
with myriad pastel colors.

Later on. the gentle people
congregated on the Dutch Quad
patio. They danced to a rock

and till 5 pm.

:"‘Thls year." someone com-
mented. ust wasn't the gay
event of ast year." The foun-
talns were turned off because
they had been plucked with
paint.

The student write-in was an
impromtu event and still re-
mains on the walls of the snack
bar. Mr. Neil C. Brown. head of
Student Activities. will decide
whether the writings and murals
will stay. He is waiting for a re-
commendation of action from the
Campu Center Governing
Board.
