Strike Draws
Over Million

Based on early returns from
about one-fourth of the partici-
pating schools, organizers of the
April 26 International Student
Strike estimated that more than

' one million students participated
in the strike.

On Saturday, the day after the
strike, with reports from 282 US.
campuses in, 382,000 students
had participated in the strike.
About 1,000 schools were expect-
ed lo participate. if they did and ~
they kept up the aVerage of 1,200
per school, student participation
Would total 1,200,000 students.

High school students also played
a major role in the strike. in
New York City, where about half
the striking schools were local-
ed. 225.000 high school students.
about 72 per cent of New York's
300,000, stayed away from class—
es.

Earl Brown. one of the high
school leaders, said. “This strike
destroyed the illusion that oppo-
sition to the war among high
school students was confined to a
minority."

On several campuses students
refused induction into the armed
forces. At most colleges there
were rallies and teach-ins held
during the strike.

There were only a few returns
from other countries. The big-
gest strike was in Japan where
all 16 of the country‘s major un-
iversities were shut down. Other
cities where there were demon-
strations included Paris and
Mexico City.

Several hundred thousand people
in 17 cities demonstrated against
the war in Vietnam on the day
following the student strike. The
largest demonstration was in
New York City, where about
100,000 participated.

American Tours Open

To Foreign

Foreign students at the Uni
versity who are interested in
learning more about American
life by visiting in American
homes are offered an excellent
opportunity to do so through
SERVAS, a voluntary organiza-
tion whose hundreds of hosts all
over the U.S.A. have openedtheir
homes to foreign travelers in an
effort to promote peace through
understanding. '

SERVAS hosts invite travelers
into their homes for a visit of
two nights and offer a warm wel-
come and a genuine interest in
sharing together their ordinary
home life and in exchanging opin-
ions, ideas and experiences. Ac-
commodations are simple and
hosts offer their hospitality with-
out charge.

Approved SERVAS travelers
plan their own itineraries, using
host lists from the areas in
which they will travel. Such vis-
its may be extensive cross coun-
try trips or weekend visits to
nearby towns.

Travelers have the opportun-
ity to visit homes in small com-

New Position

come director of academic pro-
gram development for the in-
structional Resources Center at
the University the latter part of

ay.

His appointment was approved
by the State University Board of
Trustees.

in his new post, Dr. Reisberg,
a specialist in educational com-
munications, will serve in a lia-
son capacity between the Office
of Academic Affairs and the cen-
ter to advance effective faculty
utilization of modern instruction-
al communication technologies.

doctorate in communications
from the New York University

sophy from the New York Un-
iversity Graduate School.

  

 

REZA GHAFFARI, president of the international Student
Association on campus, emphasizes the purpose of the or-
ganization, which is to broaden ene's mind.

Group  Organized

 

To Discuss Classes

A new ad hoc committee in-
volving interested faculty and
students has been for med on cam-
pus. The purpose, states Its ini-
tiator Paul Ruffer, is to in-
crease communications between
all segments of the university
(faculty, students and adminis-
trators) so that grievances with
the present curriculun(or learn-
ing methods) may be discussed
andacted upon.

in its present state, Rutter
feels the university is ineffec-
tive. A college education today
fulfills only the needs of the
student who learns for learn-
ing's sake. “Education is for
the purpose of allowing people
to be effective in society," said
Rutter.

Intelligent Dialogue Purpose

has as its goal the establishment

ences and p iiilit' r'nlighlcnmcnl.
Creegun has voiced his concern
both in The Knirkcrhm‘ker News
and in the following open letter
to the faculty of this university.

“Dear Colleague

“Seldom should members of the
academic community appeal in.
tra-mural issues to a general
public. Recent upheavals in the
life of some of our great cities.
and in that of universities them-
selves. indicate that we have
made some tremendous errors in
our assignment of educational
priorities in the last few years.
The interests of defense related
science and of space related sci-
ence are legitimate. but they
have been allowed virtually to
monopolize our forward plan-
ning. it is high time that an ap-
peal be made. both within and
beyond the campus. for the inter-
ests of human welfare sciences.
and for a renewed recognition
that public enlightenment is still
the primary task of the universi-
ty. The attached letter which
appeared in ilic April 22 Knirkcr-
boi-li'cr News represents one of
my own attempts to bring these
facts and needs home lo a broad.
socially ulcri public. Such bodies
are poiiiical parties. religious
groups. labor unions. ethnic and
racial broilicrhoods. and many
others. are making new demands
on the iiniycrsitics. and we must
find a way to incel those in terms

of our best inicllcclual rc-
sources."

organization is to try to diminish
attentions among different cul-
tures. The purpose of education
is to broaden one‘s mind in terms
of now.

“Consequently, one venue of
finding the truth would be in
providing an atmosphere in
which different cultures can
understand each other on the
basis of person to person con-
tact.“

Ghaffari emphasizes interna—
tional in describing the organiza-
tion for its scope is such that it is
more than just a club for foreign
students. American students are
urged and are given the ppm-
tunity to associate with students
of different backgrounds. Pre-
sently, the organization‘s mem-
bership stands at 80 American
and 150 foreign students.

The international Student As-
sociation is an open organization
not only in the composition of its
membership but also in the type
of activities it offers.

Social as well as an intellectual
atmosphere is provided in order
to attract as many students as

possible. Lectures, debates.
campus exhibitions are on the
agenda as well as coffee hours,
mixers, and dinners which fea-
ture menus from around the
world.

F risch Receives
$61,000 Grant

Dr. Harry L. Frisch, profes-
sor of chemistry at the Unis
versity, is the recipient of a.
$61,000 grant from the National
Science Foundation for research
entitled "Chemical instabilities
and Statistical Mechanics of
Fluids." The award is for a two-
yea.r period.

Frisch, who joined the Uni-
versity faculty last year, is a
Williams College alumnus. He
received his doctorate in phy-
sical chemistry from Brooklyn
Polutechnic institute in 1952. tie
has taught at the University of
Southern California, Stevens in-
stitute of Technology, Yeshiva
University, and Polytechnic in-
stitute of Brooklyn.

Some of the proposals in-
clude: 1. Tutorial "allure
limited to 15-20 students inwhich
graduate assistants could be
used to teach.

2. Provisions for students in-
terested in taking a semester
off to work for the purpose of
gaining perspective with respect
to goals; to take advantage of the
learning available in the “out-
side world,” or apply what we
are learning.

3. Credit should be given to
students for participation in
student and community affairs.

4. Encourage travel in the 0.8.
and abroad (foreign study).

5. The addition of a contem-
porary social problems course
as a humanities elective that
can be applied toward the ful-
fillment of the humanities re-
quirement.

6. The institution of student-
faculty committeep that would
review new ideas for the pur-

- pose of their acceptance and im-

plementation.

The committees would include:
Finance for the new university
projects suggested here; a com-
mittee to investigate the need
for and value of marks; a com-
plaint board composed of stu-
dents and faculty to whom stu-
dents and faculty could go, as a
last resort, when problems have
not been solved satisfactorily.

Ruffer has made the initial
move toward the establishment
of these committees by asking
Dean Perlmutter, chairman of
the special committee on under.
graduate education which just
came out with the report "New
patterns in Undergraduate Edu-
cation," for help in these proj—
ects.

An organizational meeting for
students, faculty and administra-
tors wili be held Wednesday,lVlay
15 in HU137 at 5 p.m.

The committees established at
this meeting will, Ruffer feels,
get action rolling for next year.
"if you do nothing, you achieve
nothing. If you are not content
with present conditions and
courses," said Ruffer, "come
to the meeting."
