Albany HousingSurvey'
Progress Report Given

Some of the results of the Su-
rvey of Albany Housing Condi-
tions and Deeds, which is being
done in ‘conjunction with the
Urban Center. were publicized at
a meeting of the Committee to
Promote Equal Opportunity last
Wednesday night.

Progress reports were given
by several students who have
been interviewin residents of
Arbor Hill and e South End
30an into slum ghettos and
being able to speak to the inhab-
itants was described as “a dra-
matic experience". Surveyors
Gregg Bell and Irene Zukowski
found the people "friendly and
easy to talk to. '

It was found that “slum resi-
dents have very definite opinions
on their housing, their needs and
their treatment." Many of those
interviewed felt that the housing
conditions were “tolerable if
only as means to an end.” Those
interviewed ex ressed the idea
of limited goa. but many felt
they had not yet reached that
point.

lrene Zulkowski found the
ghetto residents do express hope
for change. “This hope is often
translated into hopelessness
when. after a long period, few
things are corrected.” A typical
response to the question of hous~
ing satisfaction was “what can i
say? I have no alternative. I
can't live on the streets."

The question of race prejudice
also came up in conversations
with the residents. A Negro
World War 1 vetei'an,one of those
surveye felt “race prejudice is
worse in Albany that it was in
Georgia."

The Brothers. a group of Negro
men, are working with the surve-
yors introducing them to their
first few families and starting
them off. Presently. the Commit-
tee is trying to raise funds for the
Brothers. so they may continue
their work.

Soroities. fraternities and
dorms are being asked to con-
tribute to this fund.

It must be stressed that the
survey is not over. Any student
wishing to offer his services is
urged to see Dr. Harry Hamili-
ton in ES 221 or Melanie Long.
Only two weeks are left, but
many areas have yet to be
covered.

SummerPlanning

Semester In Revsew

Teach In March: (April as. May a) The recent "iri-
ternattonal student Strike Against the War in Vietnam, Racial
Oppression, and the Draft" reached over 800 in the univer-
sity Community. Professors from Harvard, Tufts and local
colleges as well as teachers here spoke on various topics
such as the psychological economic and political results
of the war. Audion-critic M! McDonald, of the New Yorker
magaune, highlighted Thursday's evening events at a panel
discussion. More than 1,000 students signed the strike peti-
tion which indicated that the aignahire was in agreement with
be objectives of the teach-in and,would’ show his support

by boycotting classes. A rally at the capitol, after amarch
down Central Avenue, wasntlie  event of the week.

“ﬂaws: (April 22): students voted for Presidential
candidates April as, 23 and 24. Results of that vote appear
on page i of this issue of the ASP. National CHOICE directors,
taking note of the participation of students in the New Hampshire
primary, felt that, "effective, articulate expression of political
opinion by ehidents, combined with their active participation
ignificahtly, affect the outcome
of elections and the shape of American politics.” 'Noofthe
referendum questions dealt with the nation's current involve-
ment in the Vietnam War and one with the priorities of govern-
ment spending in  Urban Crisis.

War No Game

To the Editor

In the ASP of March 29th,
Mr. David Zimmerman is quoted
as listing three alternatives for
the draft objectors: l-to go into
the army and bore from within;
2-go to Canada and 3-practice
some form of civil dis-
obedience.

This almost sounds like lotsof
good, clean, fun, especially when
he suggests a “Graduation Cere-
mony" with a "Summa Cum
Laude" (or those who turn in
their draft cards.

One can, of course, disagree
with the actions of the govern-
ment, and one can believe that
the Vietnam war is wrong and
illegal, but the fact remains that
our country’s history is one of
trying to do what is good for
mankind, as in World Wars 1
and It, and inthe post-war period.

Our presence in Vietnam may
be a mistake, butthere are many,
including myself, who believe
that our withdrawal would be a
greater error in terms of
susequent conflicts which could
be expected.

it is with the first-quoted al-
ternative to the draft that 1 most
strongly disagree. Subversion
within the Army is, in plain
words, treason againstthe United
States.

This is no game and no joke.
It is a capital offense. Service
in the Army is an honorable oc-
cupation, recognized by civilized
nations as a necessity.

"Boring from within" can
easily lead to the deaths of one’s
own friends and fellow citizens
and to worse conditions than
those to which the objector ob-
jects to in the first place.

Fix Education

To the Editor:
After ublication in S .pprcssior‘i
of my I(“Open Letter to SUNYA.
a few friends suggested I carry
further such criticism of this
university as appeared there. l
would like instead to draw upon
my teaching experience here and
elsewhere to indicate what might
and perhaps must be done to
improve education at Albany.
Apologies to Ezra Pound for the
title.
A Few Do’s .

1. Begin uniform teaching loads
for all faculty. well below the

resent inaximum—rtry. .stty. six
tours. More faculty, of course.

 

- COMMUNICATIONS I

 

 

 

 

will be needed in make this pos
sible; raise money for this per-
haps by increasing tuition—the
students who can will be more
than willing to pay for the en-
suing improvements. and to
compensate for increased tui-
tion, lobby energetically for
greatly increased scholarship
money. to be distributed among
those most adversely affected by
tuition raises.

2. Encourage but do not order
teachers to spend time in confer
ence with students in addition is
the minimal six hours. the time
to be arranged by students in
consultation with faculty in each
course. The six hour limitation is
in itself quite an encouragement,
but implicit in this suggestion is
the restructuring of courses so as
to permit some meaningful addi-
tional direct treatment of stu-
dents.

3. in finding faculty to fill the
additional slots. be quite honest
and energetic in going out to find
"bad risks,” a principle that
must apply more and more to the
recruitment of students also. By
“bad risk“ is meant the person
who does not have the paper
credit. or does not come from the
prestigious graduate school. but
whose qualities are assessible by
attentive interviewing and exam-
ination of whatever writing he
has done.

4. Throughout the program, en-
courage neither students nor
faculty to do the traditionally

"acceptable" thing merely for-

meal-ticket degree or the prom-
ise of increased social prestige
within the middle-class commu-
nity. This implies the discour-
agement of many from pursuing
the Ph.D. and the creation of al—
ternate programs on the gradu-
ate level that would particularly
nourish creativity and militate
against isolation of the special-
ist. This also implies redefinition
of the relation of the diilce et
iitilc in the construction of under-
graduate courses in the humani-
ties—only the more joyful forms
of ditettantism should be allowed
to survive. I
5. Govern by committee. and in
doing so. strive mightily against
the star chamber of committee.
People resist working on com»
inittees so long as they are doing
virtually meaningless work.
Create continually interactive
relationships between work in
committee and work With one's
students and colleagues. Make
all important judgments collabo-
rations among peers. but then
widen the concept of peer so that
it is based on capability and In-
terest primarily. rather than on
age. tenure. or rank ( if the lattei
