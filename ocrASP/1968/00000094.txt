Report Revisited

There is a general (student,
faculty and administrative) move-
ment on campus to change the
method of education at this uni-
versity.

This has been made obvious
by the formulation of the report
"New Patterns in Undergraduate
Education" which is designed to
renovate or revise the basic frame-
work of our educational institution.

in addition, the nucleus of a new
ad hoc committee composed of in-
terested students and faculty has
been formed for the purpose of
setting-up committees whichyrould

- actualize specific courses within

the new basic framework.
The committee was formed with

a view toward making new courses-

which would be. more relevant to
events taking place today.

Many conditions or problems
exist today in the social and po-

litical spheres which demand an-'

swers. However, students must
first be aware of these problems
before they question, discuss
and get involved with them.

Through inter - communication
among students, faculty and admin-
istrators, complex social and polit-
ical concerns which affect the
world can be discussed and acted
upon.

These students and faculty mem-
bers whojoin this committee will
be doing a tremendous service to
themselves and the university com-
munity by discussing problems
relevant and pertinent to the uni-
versity (such as the emphasis plac-
ed on grades and the degree to
which this is necessary or detri-
mental), and the world commu-
nity (such as discussion on the
moral obligations of the democ-
racy, of the nation, and of the in-
dividual's responsibility to the na-
tion).

I A work - study program under
which a student could take a sem-
ester off to work for the purpose
of gaining perspective with respect
to future jobs or goals has been
offered as another suggestion. This
would allow the student necessary
practical experience for future
references; in addition it would
acclimate him to his future pro-
fession. But most important it
would . allow him. to function 'eifecg.

tively outside of a community lim-
ited by its strictly academic goals.

The program would allow the
student to suggest and choose for
himself, with faculty and admin-
istrative advisement if needed,
the type of study he would like
to pursue.

it gives the student the oppor-
tunity to express and discuss his
ideas as well as the chance to get
involved with active programs
which could result from these
ideas.

The program necessitates and
facilitates extensive communi-
cation among all facets of people.
This intangible aspect of the pro-
gram should be the most impor-
tant and necessary result.

We feel that all students in-
terested in, making their ideas
knOWn so that they may perhaps
be implemented in the near fu-
ture, should attend a meeting set
up for this purpose Wednesday,
May 15.

  

-No student at the State Univer-
sity of New York College for Teach-
ers at Albany in 1956 could regis-
ter for more than 17 semester
hours of work (exclusive of physi-
cal education). The only excep-
tion was that a student with a B
average could take 18 hours.

Twelve years later the stipula-
tions for the maximum hour load
is the same except that the Dean's
list student may take more than
18 hours. it is interesting that
the load requirements for under-
graduates at the University is the
same as it was a decade ago
when this institution was only a
school for teachers.

The University has expanded
to include courses and departments
that would have been unheard of
if this school remainedateachers'
college. With this growth in cours-
es should have come a more flex-
ible method for a student to sched-
ule his class load.

it would seem reasonable to ei-
ther increase the maximum hours

New Function At Last

As its third year in existence
draws to a close, it seems that
Central Council has finally found
a non - financial place for itself
in the University Community. Up
until the beginning of the 67-68
Council, the legislation of impor-
tance which came from this body
was solely financial in nature.

While ruling on the disburse-

ment of over one-quarter of a '

million dollars is no mean task,
until the 67-68 Council the even
more important task of repre-
senting student opinion on cur-
rent issues of the University was
largely neglected.

Several mistakes were made
and a certain amount of misrepre-
sentation occurred, but as this was
the first venture into this area
of legislation this was to be ex-
pected.

Overall, however, we feel that
this gravitation of Council legisla-
tion toward student representation
bills is greatly needed and highly

 

system that would allow the student
‘unlimited' ﬂexibility.

The later solution is perhaps
the best in light of the varied pro-
grams the student is faced with
when he makes out his academic
schedule. If a student was not
limited by any rigid guidelines,
he and his advisor could develop
an hour load which would fit his
particular needs.

A student who was taking a lab
or language course could then take
more than the normal 16 hours
if he wished to. Or a student who
found himself short of hours could
work extra hard for a semester
and make up his lost time.

Since the limitation of the course .

hours would depend on the judg-
ment of the student. his advisor,
and possibly his dean, this plan
would call for closer contact be-
tween the advisee and advisor.

it would be an encouraging sight
to see the academic branches of
the University exploring the pos-
sibility of liberalizing the tradi-
tional limitations on the maximum

x.lioua.~load a “tidbits-'Il'flay‘carpy,‘  

 

    

commendable. We hope that this
trend will be continued by the newly
elected 68-69 Council.

We would also like to recom-
mend to this Council that they
consider and pass legislation which
would allow non - Student Associ-
ation members to vote in the
Central Council and Living Area
Affairs Commission elections.

This would not only provide bet-
ter representation for the student
body at large, but would also pro-
vide a better basis for the legisla-
tion of Central Council itself. We
do, however, support the belief that
those elected to Central Council
itself, should and must be mem-
bers of the Student Association,
since Council's other major role
remains that of legislating on Fl-
nancial matters regarding the col-
lection and disbursement of S.A.
monies.

We further feel that the election
of the Student Association presi-
dent and vice president should
be a popular one. By having
nominees selected by Council
from among its members, and hav-
ing the student body elect from
among those nominees, the best

features of both systems would be

preserved. The positions would
have more prestige and meaning
by being popularly elected, and the
president and V.P. would be likely
to have the support of Council
which is Important, as they are
also the leaders of that body.

In addition, we would like to
express our congratulations to the
67-68 Council for a job well done
under most difficultand fluctuating
conditions. And we would wish to
express our hope that the new Coun-
cil will go even further in their
financial and representative legis-
lation.

Review Of The New Right Wing

by Ray Bertrand

 

 

I attended the teach-in of two
weeks ago. Although i learned
little. I found out that leach-ins
accom lish next to nothing. I
saw fi ms. 1 discussed positions
with a few far left philosophers,
and i heard pleas for funds.

One of the interesting tidbits I
learned was the Albany's chap-
ter of SDS has no officers. Ap-
parently. they can‘t find anyone
qualified. I was also empirically
informed that few in attendance
were capable of rationally ex-
plaining their views.

I was constantly told that kill-
ing any killing. is wrong. but the
Viet Cong should murder us. and
the Negro has the right to kill.
but only if he so desires.

l was told that the goal of the
teach-inners was to make Ameri-
ca a better place to live in. but
the only way it can be carried is
if the revolutionaries destroy ii.

I was instructed . by a film.
that Americans should negotiate
in Vietnam. but. since they now
are in the process. what our
saviors were protesting, l was
informed that negotiations
should be held only in Warsaw
(or some other commie strong-
hold). I can comprehend paci-
fism. but let's not get extreme.

Slon because of the teach-in.
Fee is obsessed with love. love

Past. and I‘m sure will despise
Whatever the future may bestow.
A good many of them are not

put it bluntly. malcontenls. con-
firmed maicontents.

N0 matter what conditions
prevail. these prevail. these peo-
ple will hate it. They can't accept
anything that exists ‘as ‘good‘.

with the exception of their tacit
acceptance of capital. The only
thing they love is chaos.

Those who are accused of hat-
ed are really the ones who love.
And their love is as extreme as
any earthly emotion can be.

of some of the more prominent'
citizens of this fair town.

The members of Albany‘s Fin-
est. under intense pressure. laid
out a plan guaranteed to produce
fast results to end this sudden
burst of evil.

The first step in the plan was to
place a notice in the society sec
tion of the Times-Union remark-
ing that Mr. and Mrs. Cortland
Van Rensselaer Schuyler Ten
Broeck. one of the town's more
prominent members of high so-
ciety’s crust. was to be honored
at a banquet the following Fri-
day evening. There followed an
interview with the Ten Broecks.
which included mention of not
only their refusal to have maidsv
or other help on a live-in basis.
but also several lines about their
prize winning pedigree Siamese
cat. which they treated like a
regular Rel. allowing it to roam
aroundt e house.

On the night of the supposed
banquet. several of the key
members of the gendarmes were
stationed strategically around

the Ten Broeck mansion waiting
in silence for anything out of the
ordinary. .

Just as they had planned.about

11 pm. someone broke into the
house and was apprehended as
he crawled around whispering
“Here Kitty. Kitty. Kitty !"
What makes this story interest-
ing to us is that the thief was
none other than Dr. Bernard
Zersteff of Albany State's Chem-
istry Department.

After several hours of intensive
questioning. the police were able
to piece together the entire story.
It seems that Zersteff was taking
the cats to his private laboratory
in the basement of the Chemistry
building. humanely killing them.
and then cremating them in a
small oven.

He would then take their ashes
and mix them with different
chemicals. finally taking the en-
tire concoction and pouring it
into a lass of water.

What e was trying to do. it
seems. was to invent a formula
for “instant pussy."

alternatives offered by LAAC

or expel them. I'm for the worn-
ing of probation choices. By the
probation method. they would be
able to stay on campus to com-

There's a book soon to be
published. entitled “Dissent or

gins as follows:

stronger than life itself. holds
remnants of the past with the
adherent powers of reality. The
web is attended by the curator.
who alone can traverse the
sticky strands without becoming
transfixed himself.

On one strand we see a ship.
with eighty-three men. moored
indefinitely. far from home. An-
other strand holds the coffin of a
black man. with bloody swords
crossed over it and a mirror re-
flecting images of other men that
rest within.

Other strands hold medals of
peeling gold. im rinicd with
words of glory, onoring the
dead and gorcy. One strand
holds an ancient phonograph,
playing from a black roll of wax.
The voices interchange with
each others' words. a finite
number of voices and messages.
luliing the listener into trance.
'i‘hc listener sits with strings
streaming from his limbs toward
the phonograph.

not more hopeful. is more poetic:

University leadership has been

- often ulclt to support such

lar at tudea; it must. after all. '
please the public. Historically.
universities were established to
follow, not lead. society. They
have served to reinforce. not
question. revaillng moral dic-
tales; beh nd the ivy only folk-
ways. seldom mores, are ues—
tioned. The universities ave
been directed to serve the es-
tablishment in. the manner the
establishment requested.

The early and middle years of
this decade saw various educa-
tional spokesman articulate a
need for a new concept of univer-
sity education. Dr. Grayson Kirk
noted that it was about time that
students were freed from certain
armchair rules and regulations.
But what appeared as a noble
thought was ruined by his obser-
vation that the degree of relaxa-
tion of these rules should be de-
pendent upon the degree the stu-
dents acted as adults. Kirk also
recognized the right of students
to disapprove of university poli-
cies as long as such disapproval
consisted of “peaceful pic eting
in designated areas."

Suehthinking is res nsibie for
what might be call the “era of
tokenism"in student—adminis-
trator dealings. An apparently
legitimate student structure—
usually student govemmeni—is
asked to "participate" in univer.
sity policy formation. Such in-
volvement. however. is never
permitted to shake the ivy tower.

Major licy remains in the
hands of ass whose responsibil-
ity should consist of administra-
tion. not formation—the adminis-
traiors. A sort of unholy alliance
has been created as selected stu-
dents have assisted the adminis-
trators in effectively the de-
mands of the establishment of
whom the university is a child.

The past few years of student
ferment have exposed this alli-
.ance as a sham. The current stu-
dent power activists are tired of
the student government puppets
representing an impotent. sim-
ple-minded majority of unsophis-
ticated students. The activists
are saying that the university
had better clean house quickly
and begin to act in a responsible
manner toward America. Book-
stores had better become book-
stores. Food Service had better
start to serve Food. and then we
had better start to lead. not fol-
low. America. Now!
