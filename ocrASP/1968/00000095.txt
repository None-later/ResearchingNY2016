New York Times

To the Editor:

The New York Times of Friday,
May a (p. 81), carried in heavy
type the following statement:
“ We, Presidents of student Gov.
ernment and Editors of campus
newspapers at more than 600
American colleges, believe that
we sh0uld not be forced to tight
in the Vietnam war because the
Vietnam war is unjust and im-
moral."

Following this, for three and

 

dents, each identifiodby institu-
tion, who have endorsed the state-
ment. (The tour pageswerespon-
sored by a clerical and lay com-
mittee, identified on p. M.)

This roster is impressive by
any standard. I looked at once
for State University. I saw‘ that
.the editor of the studentp'body

president, or both, had spoken'

from Buffalo, Cobbleskill, Cort-
land, Now Palts, Potsdam, and
stony Brook. .
But nobody spoke from State
University ofNew York at Albany.
I appreciate that the students
polled were not acting as spokes-
men for their papers nor for
their constihlenclesnorcolleges,
but rather as private persons of
high caliber. As such, they are
not required to defend their de-
cision, whether to endorse-the
statement or not to endorse it.
But perhaps you would care
to comment.
Yours truly,
RE. Thornstensen

Editor's note:

When one advocates on
action that is outside the
established legal system,
he is striking at the basic
fabric a] he's government.
To protest on moral ‘
gooerrwnent act is to soar?
aide onc‘s ottisenshs‘p; to
protest it in suclra manner
so as tore/use ons’a coun-
try is sell-defeating.

Explanation
To the Editor:

There is a statement which cus-
tomarily follows fictional ac-
counts of events which indicates
that any resemblance between
the content of the drama and any
real life situation or person is
purely coincidental.

This statement should have been
afixed to the distorted report of
the April lth meeting with Presi-
dent Collins which was “report.-
ed” in the campus paper. The
members of the BLACK STU-
DENT’S ALLIANCE feel the
facts should be made public.
President Collins then indicated
that only the Governor could
close the school. I then requested
that he make such a request of
the Governor. President Collins
then asked how the other stu-
dents in the meeting felt about
the matter.

Upon finding that the majority
favored the proposal, he then
suggested that the students were
not representative of the student
body. He asked if the proposal
had been submitted tolthe Stu-
dent Council.

The President was advised that
the murder of Dr. King failed to
coincide with a Student Council
meeting date and as Dr. Kin ’s
funeral was to take place e
next day I alluded to the Alli-
ance's ex tation that he would
assume e prerogative of lead-
ership in this matter.

President Collins stated that he
could make no decision without
conferring with the Faculty and
that he did have a copy of the
statement. The President had
been advised reviously that a
copy would be orthcoming.

As time after time President Col-
line had found a reason for not
taking a personal or official
stand, I stated that his behavior
was hypocritical and left the
meeting In anger.

However, I returned with a copy
of the statement and requested
to be present‘at the Faculty-Sen-
ate meetin (which by chance
was also so eduled that day) so
as to provide appropriate inlorv
mation it needed to aid the deci-

sion.

President Collins then stated
that he had no wer to invite me
use at to Faculty-Senate
nleetng. However. if I would
wait outside he would ask the

Mdi'lilabk‘meh were

'no longer willing to wait outside
closed doors while whites inside
determined their futures. I then
stated that I was inviting myself
tothe meeting.
The President then accused me
of not wantin to be treated “e-
-qually,"- to w tell I replied that
my people have never been
treated "equally" and it was
time that such inequality of
treatment was used for rather
then against Blacks.
It is understood that student
newspapers are training grounds
for future 'oumalists. As most
“reporting’ by the national me-
dia of news concerning Black
people is biased, I am not sar—
prised by the “report” in the
cam as r.
I-Iowlgverga the future, the
members of the BLACK STU-
DENT’S ALLIANCE expect the
campus paper to use reporters
rather than aspiring fiction writ-
ers in reporting our activities.

It is nice to see a part of food
service where I can get a ham-
burger, hot dog, or French fries
that are actually hot and tasty
served by a neat and pleasant
person. It is amazing that the
Campus Center snack bar can
food such huge crowds of stu-
dents so fast and efficiently.

It is also nice to sea a part
of food service working with the

the snack bar sponsored the fine

Only in America could such

have used printed on any

Cairo Jews have been placed
under house arrest.
These Jews (not Zionists) are
denied the right to express them-
selves, whereas Israeli Arabs
have direct representation in the
Israeli government.
Some restrictions are placed on
Israeli Arabs, but nothing as

A public debate, or something on

Only then would SUNYA stu-

Teach-In

Dear Editor:

I have just read Professor
Johnston's letter ("Not a
Signer") in your Communications
cdumn.

Sincel have had an experience
of the same order, I suspect
there Is a broader issue here. In
my case, I signed a statement
supporting the current “Teach-
In" on Vietnam. I signed it
happily, lovingly and willingly.
I am opposed to the war, and I
feel that open discussion is a
constructive tool.

Moreover, there is something
touching, to me, about persons
giving freely of their spare time

explore a problem of educa-
tional concern. What irks me is
that — to mix a metaphor —
the horse I favored emerged in
reverse from the other side of
the stream.

I discovered to my dismaythat
I was supposed to have endorsed
a student boycott or strike — a
gesture which seems irrelevant
to the war, and which I feel is di-
rected against University in-
terests and contractual obliga-
lions.

I saw (and see) no sensetothis
move. Although it is irrelevant
to my point, I should add that,
to me. commitment to a cause
should take the formotadditlonal
effort, not of dereliction of duty.
Moreover, I hate to see the pur-
suit of knowledge regarded so
lightly." "' "‘ ""

efficiently, also.

It is much easier for us stu-
dents to criticize rather than
praise, but let’s give credit
where credit to due. Thank you

Israel’s Arabs

To, the editor:

Generally speaking, Israel's
Arabs enjoy a higher level of
education than the Arabs funny
at the neighboring states. The
per capita expenditure ofIsrsol
Governmental agencies is actual-
ly higher for the Arab minority
than for the Jewish majority.

Arabs sit as members of
Parliament, some representing
minority parties affiliated with
the Mapai and others as members
of predominantly Jewish Parties.

Moslem courts have jurisdic-
tion over matters of religion and
personal status affectingthsArsb
community. Arabs are not sub-
ject to compulsory military serv-
tep, although they may enlist and
some in fact do.

By any objective standard,
Israel's social policies have been
sensitive to the needs ofite Arabs
minority. Arabic remains one of
the official languages ofthe coum
try and the curriculum of Arab
schools is geared to the cultural
needs of the Arabs.

Israeli spokesmen have long
been aware that their country
cannot live in isolation from
either the Arabs oflsrael or the
Arabs of the Middle East. Arabs
and Jews are Bound together,
whether they would have it so or
not, and they must seek each
other’s compassion and under-

standing. paula Blackmsn

The marking system at Albany
State must be revised. The pre-
sent method ot awarding quality

Ints for A’s, B's, C's, D's, E’s
naccarately reflects the
achievements of the student and
stifles initiative. There are also
serious inequities in the marking
practices of various teachers and
departments.

The major flaw in the present
arrangement is that no provision
is made for pluses and minuses.
Two students. one with an to
average and the other with an 89
average each receive 3 quality
points. We are all well aware of
the amount of work and ability
that lies between a B- and a 3+
student. Why should each be
rewarded equally?

Too often, especially around
final exams, our present method
of grading causes an apathetic
attitude among students. Around
January and May we often hear
about the “meaningless final."
“I have a solic C in the course,
no chance of a' B or a D, so why
study?" Unless you are a border-
line case or the final counts
about he of the grade, the final
examination does not greatly
change your mark. With no hope
of improving or endangering a
given grade, many students logi-
cally come to the conclusion that
It is a waste of time to study for
the final in that particular
course.

The differences in testing and
grading among certain instruc-
tors also demonstrates something
radically wrong with the system.
Some teachers claim that no stu-
dent is worthy of anything better
than a C, while others freely give
A’s and B's. The result is unfair
treatment of the unwary. Usual-
Iy the upperclassman steer clear
of the tough marker, leaving him
with a class of unsuspecting
Freshmen. I do not believe that
the student should have to cope
with the disadavantages imposed
by the eccentricities of a given
professor. I acknowledge that
tangling with a "different" in-
structor and learning how to
handle his demands Is very
much a part of a college educa-
tion. However. we must also
remember that to a great extent
marks determine our future suc-
cess or failure. and should thus
be as uniformly fair and equal as
possible.

In my opinion, if certain profes-
sors become notorious for usual-

should be taken. It may take the
formof increased departmental
articlpauon in grading standards
and testing. An increased num-
ber of departmental in-sems and

of the problem. Some instructors
are sure to say that I am sugges-

their academic freedom. I would
remind them that we live in a

grades we receive largely deter-

the Vietnam War. There were no

Many Negro leaders had pre-

Rap Brown, stokely Carmichael,

the Government-and the Negro
leadership—knew there would be
trouble, but few diocgtit it would
come so soon. The murder of
Martin Luther King was the pro
mature spark.

Leaving the airport, my text
hustled north towards the center
of town. The Jefferson Memo-
rial juttod above the mass of
pink cherry blossoms as we
crossed the George Mason
Bridge. On 14th Streetl saw the
first signs of acity under martial
law. Green-halmeted soldiers
stood listlme on street
corners, and green troop trucks
dotted the side roads. Few peo-
ple were outside— the 4:80 cur-

few had left Washington anempty

Early Tuesday (April 0)Ipusb-
ed into the riot sons. The local
newspapers said 14th Street was
the western boundary ofmesone,
and sol started stthePenneyl-
vanta Avenue intersection and
walked north. There were no
signs of destruction in this sec»
tion of fine restaurants, depart
melt stores, and record shops.
Well dressed Negroes and whites
scurried from store to store,
and the only sign that this was
a trouble-torn city was the oc-
casional soldier with a little can
of Mace stuck to his belt. It
was business as usual in this
part of town.

i saw the first hints when I
turned northeast onto New York
Avenue. Plyw covered store
fronts, twisted iron names. and
soot covered walls dotted the
area. The number increased as
I moved towards 7th Street, the
worst hit area.

Reaching 7th Street, I could
see wisps of black smoke, car-
ried by the spring winds, still
drifting from jagged piles of
bricks, cooper pipes, and broken
furniture. The acrid smell of
wet burned wood singed my nos-
trils. it was here that many
buildings were reduced to burnt
heaps of rubble.

Here was the poorest part of
Washington, the place where most
of the rioters came from. It
seemed ironic that the poor would
damage their own neighborhoods
the most. It was as it they hoped
that, by razing their own rotting
homes, new and better ones would
magically appear. It wasn't lo-
gical, but maybe there is akind
of twisted rationale in it. The
National Commission on Civil
Disorders pointed out two months
ago that, "After more than three
decades of fragmented and
grossly under-funded federal

  
        

housing units remain occupied
in the United states.” Maybe
these ghetto people thought the
Government would have to give
them better housing if they do-
stroyed the old ones.

I headed south on ’fth Street
back towards the commercial.
district. I was surprised at the
number of Iootodturniture,cloth-
ing, and food stores. Miller's

in Washington the unicy-
ment rate soars to forts-pr cent
in some areas. Dr. Kingem-
phasiud this problem his
death when he said, “ re is
a major depression ‘in the No-
gro community. What the Negro
poor need most is more jobs
so they can afford the better
things in life." .
sion supports this appraisal:
“Pervasive unemployment is the
most persistent and serious
grievance in minority groups.”
Thus, many of these Negroes
were rumagtng throughthestores
of their city because they didn't
have the job that would let them
buy what they needed.

an my way back to the hotel,
I decided to engage some of the
troops in conversation if I could.
I noticed that mostotthem looked
uncomfortable and unhappy. They
acted withdelicaeyiadealingwith
the public. One white soldier
told me that he had just returned
from Vietnam. “I never imagined
we would have to do this sort
of thing back home. It was ter-
rible when our convoy drove by
the Capitol Building." Two others
I tried to talk with simply grunb
ed at the question, "What do
you think about all this?" They
just didn't seem to want to talk
about it. '

I spent four days in Washing-
ton, D.C., and saw first hand
the violence and destruction over-
taking many cfties. l was sad-
dened by what I saw, but I felt
these early outbursts might do
some good. They might do some
good by waking Congress and
more whites to the Negro’s frus-
tration over the economic pothole
he’s in. They might show a dog-
matic administration that spend-
ing three-billion dollars per
month in Vietnam will not bring
them peace at home. "They
might." is along way from “They
will," but let's keep hoping.

Kudos to .lolm (Iilbcrl! lie 5qu
something hich I doubted anyone
would see about this column: it
Is basically sell-destructive. If
what I profess here were widely
practised. my column would be
unnecessary.

As this is the eighth and final
time that this column will be
published this year. I would like
to make a few comments of gen-
eral interest.

When I started this column. I
hoped to find a goodly amount of
reaction to what I had to say.
Unfortunately. I didn‘t.

One of my fellow columnists
commented that I was using an
intellectual approach on people
who aren't ready for It. lie is
probably right. It is most sad
that so few of us carry our study-'
mg hublis Into our everyday
lives. llccuusc of this lack of in-
terest. most of us are wasting
one of the most potentially fruit-
ful periods of our lives.

All in all. I wasu'l overly dis-
appointed about the way this
column was received. The lack
of reaction did show me that
most of us here don't really give
a damn. though. -

fully researched and studied
over thc summer. I have a quote.
Credits go to Eric Fromm in The
Art of Loving. and Michael Va-
lcntine Smith in Robert Hein-
lein's Stranger in a Strange
Land. To each and every one of
you I say. “Thou art God."

Chew on that one kids. and
have an otherwise good summer.

Sometimes the world uplifts
my spirit despite discouraging
headlines. There's great humor
abroad. everywhere one looks. I
think. for instance. that human

part of the greatest comedy of
