For those of you who saw The

Albany area this March, you'll
remember that they promised a
new album in the near future.

Well. it's here.“Birthday" is
really good. The birthday cele-
bration is in honor of a complete-
ly new sound for the Association
—a lively, bouncy sound as op—

presented on the album is impor-
tant to the development of the
theme. There is a pregression
through time, which results in
the metamorphosis of a new per-

Fourth Time Around

by Igor Karoluk

 

 

It seems appropriate to begin
with a few words on this year's
highly successful jazz festival.
The whole scene was magnifi-
cent and the student body's re-
ception proved that we can ac-
cept and enjoy a music form in

which we are not totally versed.

We were bombarded with so
much talent it would be difficult
to give them all a fair shake. My
favorites were the Charles Lloyd
and Gary Burton Quartets. Lloyd
and his group were fantastic—
their animation, their total as-
sault on the listening sense was
beyond description. Burton’s
group, on the other hand, had a
more thoughtful sound backed up
with the development of the four
outstandin musicians which
made up t e group. Steve Swal-
low was the stand-out with his
unbelievable treatment of the
bass, characterized by melody
lines which I would have thought

impossible from the instrument.

The only flaw in the whole show
is that the gym is no place for
music. The PA system was atro-
cious—the only time I under-
stood Dan Pcrlmutter was Satur-
day, when the mikes went dead.
Much of the music was lost or
trapped somewhere in the con-
crete roof, most notably with
Keith Jarrett‘s piano and Cavril
PJyne's voice. All this rc-em-
phasizcs the fact that this Un-
iversity dearly needs a field

is to come. It announces the new
change which will take place

soon.

“Like Always" continues this
pregression of change. It begins
as a carefree. happy-go-lucky
sort of number, but as it contin-
ues, a secondary theme of side 1
appears with the lyrics:

"Don’t slip away, like al-
ways." Side 1 shows a preoccu-
pation with the ephemeral ele-
ments of life. “Rose Petals, ln-
cense and a Kitten" is a reflec-
tion of dreams past. “Everything
that Touches You" also shows
the need to ascertain a concrete
thing—“You love for real, you
show the feel of everything that
touches you. ”

The last song of side 1 again
repeats the idea of irreality and
intangibility, through a combina-
tion of lyrics and melody. The
first sounds resemble a toyshop,
or a music box because of the
lightness of melody. The lyrics
describe a girl as “a stargazer,
scarcely here. . . passes her days
in magical ways."

Side 2 of “Birthday” resumes
with the element of passing time.
which will bring the new birth.
This change which time brings
will reject the wasted time on old
memories of what can never be.

“Time For Living", now being

heard as a popular tune. is so
vivacious that it makes you want
to get up and dance.

“1 found the secret to life—l

took some time for living. Took
off my watch. I found I had all
the time in the world. Opened my
arms so I could hold life like a
beautiful girl."

it’s refreshing to have some-
one enjoying life for a change.

Torch” ’68 Reﬂects
“Recent School Year

by Charles Tallant

The 1968 Torch is out and. its
debut demands some immediate
comment. This year’s Torch is
hysically one-third smaller than
previous years. For those who
hate to strug le with a heavy,
bulky book. i e new yearbook
will be a delight. The format of
the Torch is still the same

in unusual and refreshing poses.
The physical plant of the univer-
sity reaches new heights of beau.
ty and enchantment through the
lenses of Photo Service—espe-
cially the panoramic roof view of
the campus.

Candids of Albanystudents and
campus life will undoubtedly
bring back fond memories of a
year well spent. The picture of
the Dippikill campus (and the
“tired' couple on the mattress)
are good, but what happened to
the Mohawk site?

Last year’s “Gentle Thursday”
is portrayed with much feeling
and subtle emotion while the sec-
tion on the arts is equally as well
done. The recapitulation of un-
iversity plays makes one relive
the performances once again.

The Dow Chemical Demonstra-
tion is shown in all its disrupting
force along with shots of the stu-
dent march on Washington last
year.

the 1967 Jazz Festivallayout is
good, but why waste two pages
on the Door's concert at RPI—
better to devote the pages to un-
iversity concerts.

Student organizations (literary,
musical, and governmental) are
shown in the usual manner but
occasionally spiced with some
new, ingenious poses.

The Greek section is good. The
pictures of the fraternities and
sororities are excellent this
year; however. members would
have liked to see all the names
published, not just the officers.
Lack of space is probably a fac-
tor to consider when making this
complaint. Who can say the pic-
ture of Potter Club in front of the
police station is not great?

The sports section captures the
spirit of Albany teams, the smell
of victory, rough competition,
and bitter defeat. Hopefully in a
few years, football pictures will
be a major part of this section.

RobertCutty‘s "Yearin Retros-
pect" on the last pages of the ‘68
Torch is inappropriate for a stu-
dent body yearbook. His “cut-
ting" and biased views really
belong in the ASP under an opi—
nion column.

Torch 1968 in photography, lay-
out. and organization is one of
the best editions in recent years.
It follows the tradition of Torch
‘67 in omitting any commentary
on the pictures; however, in the
future I would like to see more
captions, if appropriate and wit-
ty.

The Four Tops
Repeat Concert
At Armory

by Allan Lasker

The Four Tops again visited
Albany last Friday at the Wash-
ington Armory. The concert was
sponsored by the Student Senate
of Sienna College. The group.
with their unique talent to excite
an audience and involve them in
the performance, repeated their
successful university concert.

When the Tops sang “Reach
Out," “Standing in the Shadows
of Love." "Bernadette," "7
Rooms of Gloom," "1 Can‘t Help
Myself," “Walk Away Rene,”
and of course their multi-inillioii
seller, "Baby i Need Your
Loving," the spectators once
again responded enthusiastically
with applause and cheers.

After the hqu hourintermission,
the audience seemed to have
calmed down; but as the ’l‘ops
started to sing “Reach Out." the
audience left their seats and
made a mad dash to the vacant
.floor space iipftontof the stage.

Theatrical Season

by Francine Holz

What is certainly the most
ambitious undertaking of tiie
State University Theatre Season
— the First Quarto edition of
Shakespeare's "Hamlet" —— was
launched Tuesday night at Page
Hall and will play through May
11. A most unusual expericnco
in itself, the first Quarto Is an
earlier version of the “llam-
let" that most people are fa-
miliar with and one that is rare-
ly presented today.

There is nowhere to begin
evaluating this production except
to say that in terms of diction,
movement, and actingqualitythls
was, in the whole, a very fine
offering. John Fotia, in one of
his rare acting roles, played an
excellent Hamlet that was at
times almost brilliant.

Despite a beginning that struck
one more like a sulking child
than a tortured prince, Fotia
soon grew to the noble proposi-
tions of the melancholy Dane.
From this point on the per-
formance was one of true an-
guish, wit, and at moments mad-
ness. It is unfortunate that such
a fine job had to be marred
by what, for want of a better
word, must be called "leaping
exits." The actor would stand,
arms outstretched, deliver a
final couplet, pause, then dash
wildly from the stage. After a
while such exits became in-
congruous and even comic.

In terms of other performanc-
es, the quality was generally
good, and the language clear
and precise. Barbara Devio cre-
ated a very sensitive and regal
queen while Eugene Fartnaccl's
Corambis took full advantage of
the humor in the character. Per-
haps the only two really dis-
appointing performances were
given by Kenneth Terry as Leer-
tes and Laura Miller as Ofelia.

Last Saturday night's concert,
the last of three jazz shows, was
an artistic success but a failure
for several reasons. The concert
was not geared for the many
parents who attended. Not only
did parents complain about the

quartet played for over an hour).
parents also complained
about the uncomfortable bleech-
ers (there were no backs on
them) and the unbearable heat

Theatrically. this last semes-

productions presented by State

polished but the plays them-
selves were actually poor. “The
Affairs of Anatole" was a one-

joke play which was not really
necessary. While the acting was
at its usual high level, the play-

lines.
“The Fantasticks" was just that.
