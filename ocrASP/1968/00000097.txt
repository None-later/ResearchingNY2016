The RPI contest, regardless of the Score, was shard-fought contest throughout, as
evidenced by the total of almost 25 minutes‘ in penalties andacoupleof short-lived

fights. From the opening faceoff, however, i

The scoring was opened early
in the first quarter when Kev
Sheenan fed Steve Jakway for an
Albany goal.

The next six minutes were
scoreless, but then Jakway ripped
home another goal, and State led
2-0 at the end of the firstquarter.

In the second quarter, Albany
continued to pull away, with two
- goals by midfielder” Mike
Barlotta and one by Jakway push-
ing the Danes ahead. Butthe high-
light of the quarter, and perhaps
the game, came when Larry
Smith, the Albany attackman-
turned-goalie, stopped an RP}
shot in the goal, then raced 80
yards up the field, leaving RPI
defenders stewn in his path, to
score an unassisted goal. Bruce
Sand, continuing his fine passing,
picked up two assists in the quar-
ter. RPI scored twice, on goals
by Madigan and Wilby.

in the thrid quarter, Albany
outscored RPI 5-1, upping its
margin to 11-3. Mike Barlotta
again had two goals, while Mark
Werder, Steve Jakway and Mike
Golub fired in one apiece. Again,
Sand had two assists, with Jakway
‘ picking up one. D’Avlno scored
RPl's lone tally.

Steve Jakway scored the only
State goal in the remainder of
the game, with Sabeila scoring
for RPI, and at the end, State
had its third straight win with-
out a loss, 12-4.

The fourth win of the year
came soon after, at the expense
of the Tri-Cities Lacrosse Club.

Sailing Club Protests

Members ’Championship 2:. that. assists:

The Sailing Club from Albany
State participated in the Middle
Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing
Members' Championship this

_ past Satur<hy and Sunday.

Pending the outcome of a pro-
test of one of the races, Albany
will finish either second or third

. in a field of six colleges. if the
protest is allowed, Albany will
finish second behind_ George
Washington University. other
,wiso, New York University will
- be given second place.

After the first day .of sailing,
Albany was in third place with
thirty-four points. George Wash-

r ington recorded thirty-nine points

Potter Club took over esole

on the first day while New York
University compiled a total of
thirty-eight points. The last race
of the day is the one under pro.
test, however, and so these
scores may be changed. If the
protest holds, Albany will be
given the extra points needed to
take first place — for Satur-
day‘s competition.

in addition to Albany finishing
in second rather than third the
outcome of the protest will deter-
mine whether or not JohnScrgalis
wins the top skipper award. If
the protest stands, Set-galls will
be given the extra points neces-
. any to. give top points and con-

sequently top Skipper.

3.1,

in two matches this past week, the Albany State Tennis team raided its record to
two wins and four losses. in. a match against Stony Brook, the tennis squad was de-
feated in six of the eight divisions. The squad won the next match. however, when
they all but shut out Fairleigh Dickenson University in an 8-1 match.

In the match against Stony

at first singles and the
first doubles team of Mc-
Dermoit and Outstacher.

The match, however,
was closer than the score
indicated as each of the
divisions was decided in
three sets.

Against Fairleigh Dick-
enson, the only loser for Al-
bany was lra Outstacher, atthird
singles. Brian McDermutt, par-
ticipating in the first singles
spot, extended his record to five
wins with a single loss. Tom
Wolemik continued the scoring
for Albany as he defeated his op-
ponent in the second singles spot.
Outstacher then lost to.his op-
position st third singles by a
score of 4-6, 6-4, 4-6. With -
only a slight turn about in the
scoring of this match, Albany
would have recordeda shutout in
the match. ' ‘

Following Outstncher’s loss,
Albany swept the remaining
matches as Jeff Faulkner won
at fifth and Dennis O'Leary won

were able to defeat their op-
ponents.

Throughout their - first six
matches, Brian McDermoti has
been the outstanding perform-
er as his loss came when the
team was shut out by RPI. In
addition to his outstanding per-
formance in the first singles
spot, McDermoit has guided the
first doubles team, with ire
Outstacher as his partner to a
record of four wins and two
'losses. '

Conch Hathaway commented
that based upon the strength of
the first singles and first dou-
bles along with reliableperform-
ances from-his players, the team
should be able to play to my
peak for the rest of the year.
