New MS Degree Program Offered
By English Education

A new master‘s degree program
is now offered in teaching English
as a second language.

A master of science degree is
offered in the School of
Education under the auspices of
the department of English
education. The program is ﬂexible
in nature to serve the individual
needs of candidates from varied
backgrounds, academic and
professional, foreign or domestic.

A basic core of required courses
will achieve the objective of the
program, while supporting courses
of an interdisciplinary nature will
draw on the resources of such
departments as speech and drama,
anthropology and sociology,

Romance languages and
literatures, psychology, and
English.

The program is intended to

prepare both native and
non-native speakers of English to
plan, teach, and supervise English
language programs in the United
States and abroad.

The term “English as a second
language“ embraces one or any
combination of three language
skills‘A aural-oral command,
reading, and writing.

One of the purposes of the
program may be viewed as
teaching the student how to
convey to non-speakers of English
the set of linguistic habits he
already possesses as a native or
near-native speaker of English.

Anyone with a bachelor's
degree from an accredited
institution in the United States or
an equivalent education in a
foreign country may apply for
acceptance in the program.

24 New Scholarships
For Black Students

Twenty-four new scholarships,
from funds raised in various
Campus Chest drives, are among
those announcedfor 1968 by
Hugh W. Lane, President of thlI
National Scholarship Servrcc and
Fund for Negro Students.

These funds, allocated to
NSSFNS from 27 separate college
drives of which Albany State was
one, and one high school, total
some $13,000 for this year and
have been placed in a Combined
Campus Chest Supplementary
Scholarship Fund from which the
awards are made.

The 24 Combined Campus
Chest scholars come from 13
states and will enroll as freshmen
at 24 colleges in fifteen different
states. They represent a sizeable
proportion of the 345 NSSFNS
scholars who will this year be in
attendance at 192 American
colleges. l3~l of the l968
NSSFNS does not make senior
year awards, preferring to spread
its limited funds among new
students less able to get help

freshmen scholars are
among the 8,000 black students

were counsoled through the
NSSFNS system of college referral
which matches student and

basis, puts students in contact
with colleges most likely to admit
them and provide adequate
financial aid.

Each NSSFNS scholar receives
basic assistance from the college
admitting him as a condition for
receiving supplementary assistance
from NSSFNS. An increasing
number of colleges are putting
together adequate financial aid

Exchange

Program Offered

International education has
developed rapidly throughout
recent years at the University.
Currently there are foreign
exchange programs at the
Universities of Nice, Wurzburg,
and Guadalajara.

At Nice, the students are
housed in regular French
dormitories. Each has his own
private room in the dorm, and
pays only $16 a month, due to
subsidation by the French
government.

The program at the University
of Nice is the first of its kind to
be jointly sponsored by the four
university centers at Stonybrook,
Buffalo, Albany, and Binghamton.

The program at the University
of Wurzburg, undertaken in
collaboration with the State
University College at Oneonta, has
probably the most advanced
affiliation of any SUNY unit with
a center of learning abroad.

Twenty-six SUNY students
spent the 1967-68 academic year
in Wurzburg. They received two
intensive preparatory courses
during the summer, integrating
them with the German student
body.

Extensive tutoring and special
exams were instituted to bridge
the gap between the American
andGerman systems of education.
This year, thirty-one students are
attending the university at
Germany.

In addition to the programs in
France and Germany, the
University offers study-abroad
programs in Mexico and Puerto
Rico. A student can take courses
at the University of Guadalajara
on a semester basis conducted by
Professor Frank Carrino, Director
of the Center for Inter-American
Studies.

At the University of Puerto
Rico, students can take courses
for credit, on an individual basis.

This year there are thirty~five
students at Nice, nine of which
are from Albany. During the
1969-70 school year, forty
students will be sent abroad to the
University.

Applications are NOW being

accepted for the 1969-70 year

abroad in Nice. A student neeed
not be a French major to
participate. Anyone wishing
further information may contact
the Department of Romance
Languages.

Plans being far advanced, a
ptogram at the University of
Rome is expected to be in
operation for the 1969-70
academic year. At this time, it is
set up for those students majoring
in Italian, art, architecture, and
the Classics.

The field of foreign exchange is
growing rapidly, ‘ and many
programs are being considered in
various countries throughout the
world. It is eventually hoped that
50% of the student body at the
University will have some kind of
foreign study during their college
years.

The future holds many new
innovations in the field of
international exchange.

Convocation Dare:

Rode

by Ira

em Enviroan

Wolfman

staff reporter

“We do not admit you tonight
to a sanctuary from civic
responsibility. We demand of you
construction, not destruction."
With these words, the principal
speaker at the 125th traditional
convocation, Prof. of Political
Science, Robert Rienow
challenged the 1600 freshmen
present to aid in “the redemption

of the quality of American
environment."
In his convocation address,

Prof. Rienow admitted that “You
are heirs to a world of fantastic,
shocking, even damning
problems."

He later went on “You are the
heirs, my friends, not only to
social injustices and international
anarchy; you are the heirs to an
environment of stinking
rivers,...littered landscapes, barren
speedways, a vaulting insult of
noise, poisons, crowding and
mental diseases-~never before
equalled in all of history."

Throughout the body of his
address, Rienow const’antly linked
our social problems as they exist
today to the problems of
conservation in the world. “All
your social improvements depend
almost wholly on the environment
from which we draw all our
physical needs," be asserted.

Poverty was also a topic in this
speech. Rienow said, “You are
interested in poverty-~and you
well might be." He went on to
state, however, that
impoverisliment--the “absence of
all wealtlt"--is a grave problem
which must be treated and
considered very carefully.

lticnow then closed by telling
the freshmen, "Your generation is
going to have to face up to things.
Not just the perfection of civil
rights-"hot just the wiping out of
povcrly... or the promotion of
world peace, but you are going to
havu lo develope an ‘Ecological
Conscience.’

The [home of curing society's
ills-vfMixvd with an active concer
for the ecological future of thc
\vurldl was repented throughout

the evening. In his invocation, the
Reverend Frank Snow also made
this his theme.

Rev. Snow asked that there be
a new concern for justice,
helping us to remember others
who do not live in houses of glass
and light; those for whom the
freedom we know is but a
dream.” He asked that we be
delivered from the “vanities of
academic life," and that we “seek
not our own advancement...but

I

the salvation of a desperate
world."
The convocation program

began with the traditional candle
lighting ceremony. Director of
Admissions Frank Krivo presented
the class of 1972 to President
Collins, who then personally
extended his welcome to the
freshmen.

Duncan Nixon, president of the
Student Association, also
addressed the Students. In his
address, Nixon said “I welcome
most of you to four years of
decision--to four years in which
ylu must choose between
accepting the status quo and
finding your own particular niche
within it; or to devote yourself to
an effort toward efficient
change.”
