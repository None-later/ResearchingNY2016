 Long Hot Summer

D._ .. __..,._... _ ..._..

This summer I had a chance to
see several classic films, from
“Birth of a Nation" to “Jules and
Jim," so most of the local theatre
fare looked like distinctly minor
league stuff. Some notes on a
mainly long dry summer:

“Wild in the Streets"—-Even
cruder and more forced than
"Privilege." An honest movie
about youth would at least
slightly shake the over-thirty
crowd, but this piece of tripe
about a national youth takeover

(with adults herded into
concentration camps—get it?) is
silly enough to make even

Grandma complacent.

"Rosemary's Baby”-A strong,
tight entertainment. I wish the
last scene could Iiave been subtler
(did everybody have to shriek,
“Hail Satan”?) biit throughout
Polanski displays, as in
“Repulsion,” a genius for
springing those nasty little
surprises and for planting
repellent tactile detail (tag. that
fecal f'lvllit‘OIu" mousse oii
liosciiii ry'i; napkin).

“I'I‘c l)l‘ll.'1ll\‘l‘ .triilis‘u‘ iii
"ertaii ’Ii‘LiiIIh of cui icul ti-..-'lli_\'
diaiogu -, explictt Iioiii'isexnulity,‘
this moxie fails in lL.‘. overall
structure. Coincidence slams
against coincidence until the holes
in the plot are big enouin to drive
a bus through'.‘ and after a while
all the naughty words and sordid
revelations in the world can't
make this anything but the same
old i‘lollvwood corn.

“War and i’eace‘ 'linormous,
of course, even cut in lialfas it is.
Discreet iidaptation, unobtrusive
(though at times gooey)
cinematography flawless casting,
and impeccable period detail. The
battle scenes are simply the
biggest ever put on film. Try to
see this movie‘ when you have 6%
hours to spare.

“l’etulia” Like Denise
Levertov's dog, Richard Lcstci
films are "intently
haphazard“-~-“Petu|ia" expcclally
so. Lester camouflages a banal
plot by a stunning, fragmented
technique; a thousand bright
pieces pasted into a glittery shape,
the film is as glossy as ii 'l‘ii'finiy
lamp and about as esthcticiilly
significant The mosaic style
refuses to mix with essentially
straightforward content, and the
analysis Lester attempts remains
obstinately on the surface, just
fancy figursskuting. But George C.
Scott and Shirley Knight give
splendid performances. and
visuallyi-as we expect with
Lester the movie is exquisitely
imaginative.

“The iiride Wore Biack"~l"or

’i‘ruffant fans, a disappointment
even greater than "Fahrenheit

461.” A thriller a la Hitchcock
shouldn't forget that more style
won't evoke suspense. Hitchcock's
technique whats, reinforces, and
patterns tensions evoked by clever

Fine Summer Groups

It's a good bet that the capitol
district summerentertainment will
be hard to beat during the
upcoming winter season. The
entertainment was rich in quality
Is well as quantity.

August 5,’the capitol district
was host to the Supremes who
performed at the Saratoga
Performing Arts Center. The
supremes, consisting of three
charming and vivacious ladies,
were discovered by the music
world in 1964. Their first two
years of recording was highlighted
by seven gold records.

A full house at the SPAC
witnessed the Supremes sing with
their unique style of excitement.
They sang a wide selection of
numbers, including “Baby Love,"
“Where Did Our Love Go,” and “I
Hear A Symphony."

The Supremes created a sense
of oneness with the audience as
they had children from the
audience come up on stage and
dancevto their harmonizing. The
received a round of applause
which lasted for five minutes after
they left the stage.

August 19 the capitol district
was host to Simon and Garfunkel.

17,000 individuals packed the
SPAC—an all time record. Art
Garfunkel and Paul Simon

received immediate applause from
the audience as they struck just a
ew chords of a particular
number.

After a fast paced performance
and three encores, they retired
from the platform with a standing
ovation of considerable length.
The popularity of the two
performers may be due to their
unique word diction. Their

“C'oudy” is a perfect
description of a lazy day when
throughts range from “Tolstoy to
Tinkerbell, from Berkley to

“Richard Cory,” tells about a
person who is envied by all for his
materialistic life, but because he
lacks true happiness, he commits
suicide. In short, Simon and
Garfunkel have done much to
sophisticate and beautify modern
music.

The capitol district was also

Broadway a little closer to Albany

performers, Kurt Peterson and

roles of Maria and Tony, the two
star-crossed lovers of Wart Side

Quadrangle.

Richard Rogers, composer and
producing director of the Music
Theatre of Lincoln Center, hand
picked Kurt and Vicki from scores
of other young talents. The
production, which was a part of
the Lincoln Center Festival ’68,
played to capacity audiences for
the entire summer, and was
acclaimed by the New York

revival of ii theatre masterpiece.
Karl and Vicki received
tremendous praise as both their
careers skyrocketed.

Reverie

The recording is done in four
"phases". The first recounts the
history of music from Mozart
through the 30's, 40‘s, and 50's to
the Beatles in ten short selections.

Phase two begins with "The
Peat Goes On" amd tjem ,pves
nto Beethoven‘s “Fur Elise" and
“Moonlight Sonata”. This is one
of the best parts of the album
became the arrangement is so well
handled.

The switching between the
classical style and hard rock is
expertly executed; you don‘t feel
any jarring at the changes which
are for the most part subtle (one
transition goes from piano to
electric piano to organ).

It is a very compelling and
interesting passage The phase
finishes with the beat going on in
a cha-cha rhythm.

Phase three is, perhaps, most
interesting. It opens with Neville
Chamberlain announcing the
accord with Hitler; then as
Chamberlain iiitones "Never to go
to war again", you bear “Zeig
hell".

Then the history of the last few
decades is traced: Pearl Harbor is
bombed, Roosevelt dies,
Heroshima is bombed, one of the
Russian Premiers is lilking peace
while Edison's IIltIU speech is
played over the Russian‘s voice,
and then Kennedy asks what you
can do for your country.

Then to emphasize the point
you hear echo's of “Never to go
to war again“ played over the
theme.

Phase Four begins and ends
with “The Beat Goes On” and in
between is an interview with the
Vanilla Fudge.

The style of the Vanilla Fudge
is distinctively theirs; no one else
could handle this theme the way
they do and get away with it.

arrangement. The classical parts of
the record could he garish and
disquieting.

The recording is both forceful
and intriguing: it‘s one album
which every time i listen i hear
something new; I don‘t tire of it.

The Fudge will be appearing
tomorrow night at Gibbons Hall,
Seina College. Tickets are on sale
at the door. If you can get there,
go! if their concerts are anything

Shortage 0f Men Dims
F rash Soccer Hopes

With the opening of the
freshman soccer season only one
week off the prospects for a
successful year are not too bright
according to the new coach Mr.
James Handzel.

Right now the team is still
unsettled and Coach I'Iandzel
hasn't had enough time to

evaluate them, but he does feel
that over-all their main weakness
is defense. At this moment the
key players seem to be forwards
Gavin Lowder and Terry Wilbert.

The biggest disappointment to
Coach Handzel so far is the lack
of interest shown by the freshman
class. Expecting to carry at least
twenty-five men, Coach Handzel
found, to his surprise, that he had
only thirteen candidates out for
the squad. Out of these thirteen
men there are some who have
never played soccer before.

Since a starting team consists of
eleven men many problems will
arise. First off, there will be
absolutely no depth. Second,
since soccer is a game where the
players are constantly running,
having only two substitutes will
cause the team to tire quickly.
The third problem will be that the
team won't even be able to
scrimmage during practice. To add
on to this is ii tough schedule
which includes such tough teams
as I'Iartwick, R.P.I., Oneonta, and
Rockland CC.

It seems to me that in a class of
eight hundred freshmen boys,
who go to a school Were there is
no football team, the interest for
soccer should run a little higher.
Anyone who does decide to go
out for the team will be assured of
a fair chance to make it. If enough
interest is shown Coach I-Iandzel
said that lie would probably keep
more than the twenty-five men he
had planned on. So if any
freshman wants to get on a team
this is a good time to do it, seeing
as how their biggest need is
manpower.

Right now though, with
matters as they are, Coach
Handzel summed up the outlook
for the season in these words,
“The boys will really have to do a
lot of running and hustling if we
expect to have a winning year".

Many Events Planned
For Expanded WRA

Probably one of the most
upcoming organizations on
campus this year is the Women's
Recreation Association (formerly
the Women‘s Athletic
Association). With its new name
the W.R.A. has also planned a
greater scope of activities than Iias
been offered in previous years.
They will be taking advantage of
every facility available to them in
the new gymnasium to provide
one of the most varied and

interesting programs the women
have ever been offered.

The first scheduled event will
take place on Activities Day in a
booth in the area around the
Campus Center. It will feature
demonstrations of some of the
activities offered by the program
followed by a picnic at the lake at
ll PM. for all women interested in
learning about and participating in
future events.
