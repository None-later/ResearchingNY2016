Mall Grant
Doubled

ALBANY, NY. (UPD—State
Comptroller Arthur Levitt ap-
proved a compromise agree-
ment Thursday to more than
double the state subsidy for a
442-unit housing project in the
South Mall development.

Under terms' of the agree-
ment. $7.4-million of the $18.4-
million cost of the low income
housing project will now come
from the overall construction
cost of the South Mall complex.

The original agreement called
for 500 low income rental units
at an estimated cost of $10.2-
million with an annual state
subsidy of $-I66.00(). Under the
imendcd agreement. the state
subsidy will be $966,000 a year.

Unit cost has more than dou-
bled from 3520.400 three years
ago to $41.62!). Levitt said.

Levitt said the upward trend
in construction costs since 1965.
poor subsoil conditions, and the
scarcity of skilled labor account
for the increased unit cost.

The development will include
102 efficiency and one-bedroom
apartments specially designed
for the elderly. Seven additional
buildings of seven and eight
stories will contain 340 apart-
merits.

When initial occupancy begins
in 1970. it will mark the first
time in the state that high rise

Invasion 0f Czechoslovakia '

At first I could u ily stare at
my friends to see if they were as
shocked as I as we stood in the
Souvenir shop of the Hotel
Europe in Leningrad. USSR and
heard the words “the SovietUnion
has just invaded Czechoslovakia."
I was totally confused and
worried because those words
could mean so much but said so
little.

I didn’t know whether to
ask questions about the
technicalities of the invasion or
worry about what could happen
to the group that I bclonged to.
that was still touring the Soviet
Union. A member of our group
told us the news that a Soviet
student had heard from Voice of
America. The Russian was
standing there so I immediately
asked the same questions that
everyone else asked that day. but
no one answered.

I asked how many troops
had entered the country and if

He introduced Steve Jones who
spoke about where to find
volunteers and how to get them
involved in a campaign. Jones
believes the most effective appeal
can be made by directly
approaching the voters.

“Each person (volunteer) is the
center of a small universe." as
such he can influence and
stimulate others as does a ripple in
a pond.

“There are two types of
volunteers-those who do small
things (making 10 telephone or

In all "uses. advised Juries.

“have something for them to do
before you ask them for help.

“Some (volunteers) have been

patriotic. others hIJVe been asked
and have no good reason not to.”

“There are five weeks left

they were ﬁghting or were they
just “occupying.” I then asked
why they were there. A more
optomistic member of our group
tried to shrug the announcement
off with the comment. that there
are always troop coming and
going and maybe they were there
for “manuevers.”

I somehow sensed the
ominous meaning of this news. I
had been in the Soviet Union four
weeks and had talked to Soviet
students about the liberalization
taking place in Czechoslovakia.
Three Soviet students had given
me the idea that this liberalization
would not be allowed to continue.
They were pleased to see their
Czechoslovakian brothers gaining
freedom. because they would have
liked some too.

When we had talked of it,
they were also a little sad. They
knew that the reforms would be
stopped and then the citizens in
Czechoslovakia and the Soviet
Union would have less freedom
and everyone would he a little
more closely watched. I knew that
these same Soviet friends would
be shaking their heads with
sadness and sympathy for the
Czechoslovakian people.

There was not much I could
do about ﬁnding out what the rest
of the world was doing or how the
Czechoslovakian people were
reacting to the entrance of the
troops. We went on our day-long
excursion to Novgorod. one of the
oldest centers of civilization in the
Soviet Union. and I continued to
wonder.

It would have been
comforting to be able to turn on
the television and hear a panel of
news comrnentators explaining
the facts and what their
coiisequenCes could be as we have
become used to during times of
crisis. but. there were no
commentators. There was no
complete analysis of what was
happening in the minds of
government officials or what was
happening in the U.N. We had the

Czechoslovakia at the request of
the Czechoslovakian government.
to save its citizens from the
"counterrevolutionary
influences." There was an
ideological discussion of these
influences and then the
announcement that no country
would ever be allowed to break
away from the Communist Bloc.

l was still trying to figure
out who or what in the
government had ordered these
troops. There was no news of
what had happened when the
troops had entered the country. I
had no idea. as I found out later.
of the cold reception the troops
had received by the people they
had gone in to "save."

The next big puzzle in my
mind was what the United States
was doing about this invasion. I
had an idea that my group could
be affected by a decision of
disapproval that the US. might
make. Actually we were leaving
the country Saturday so there
wasn't much time to worry about.

From Wednesday to
Saturday life went on as usual for
the people of Leningrad and for
us. There were no groups of
citizens protesting any kind of
unfairness. We waited because
soon we would get the details of
the invasion as the rest of the
world knew them. The Soviet
citizens. however. would never
hear those details.

Only the most aware might.
ever think that the rest of the
world might be hearing different
facts from what they were
hearing.

Saturday ﬁnally came and
after a minor customs delay we
boarded the plane to Helsinki.
Finland. less than an hour away.
Soon after we arrived at the
institute where we were staying.
we met the group of 33 that had
been in Moscow. We started
swapping rumors in an attempt to
put the pieces together and find
out what really happened. They
had been watching the Kremlin,
but watching it gives little

indication of what’s going on
inside.
Someone had heard that

Dubcek, the head of the
Czechoslovakian Communist
Party. had been killed. Someone
else said no, but where was he?

Someone had heard that
China Iiad entered “the war"?
What war? Rumors, rumors and
no one knew anything for sure.
Finally we located an English
language newspaper and
discovered that the rest of the
world was also confused That was
nice to know and a little bit of the
worry was gone became I knew
that as soon as I found a
newsstand I could find lhe latest
issue of Time magazine or
Neuswcek and have all the tiniest
details at least slated. if not
coiiiplciely explained. Now I
could relax and let the
krcinlinologlsls figure it out and I
could read ll
