It has not come to our notice that tlte gates tltat
block tlte ﬁre lattes have been condentned because of
tlteir impracticalness during tlte winter months of the
year. The fact tltat they will be unuseable within a
few months should be reason enough for them to be
taken down. But, there is a greater reason why the

barriers should be destroyed. Their existence cairses a

gross disservice to the
(‘olonial Quads.

For instance. a dairy supplier was attempting to fill
tlte vending machines Sunday. September 23. htil
because of the weekend the loading dock till the quad
was locked. The supplier could not deliver his
prodtict to the empty vending machines.

Since there is a shortage of security officers, the
security office stated that they cotild riot he locking

and tinlockiitg doors for all the services that came on

the campus.

If the barriers on State Quad did not exist, tlial
supplier would have beeir able to reach the vending
area tltrougli Eastman Tower. However. this is itot the
case. and it appears that the student on State Quad

The Right Way

by Robert lumen

 

 

 

Some time ago, James Reston
observed that the “Old
Generation" of nineteenth
century leaders like Johnson,
DeGaulle, Salazar, and Mao
Tse-tung were passing out of
world politics. But, claimed
Reston, these same men are
“trying to impose the Middle
Generation-the men of the
Depression and the cold war-~on a
Young Generation;"and the
results could be, at best,
“awkward.” This uncomfortable
feeling that “we are hacking into

more than a threat.
That article,

written on June 2, and one week

later Reston‘s hope was washed

however, was

away with the tears being sited for
Kennedy: the central shaft of the
orbit had been taken away on
June 5. This “Final Irony of
Death," declared Reston,
“virtually assures the nomination
of Ilubert Humphrey and Richard
Nixon," tlte Middle Generation he
spoke of one week before.

fear of losing the Middle

What this anachronism seems to

The 1968 Presidential
Campaign has pointed out a
dramatic shortcoming in the
American Political System. In this
election year too many people
have found themselves alienated
from the traditional two major
parties and are seeking third and
fourth party alternatives.

The fact is that while the
American public is polarizing to
the "left" and "right," the
Republican and Democratic
Parties each attempt to represent
botlt conservative and liberal
viewpoints. The result is
meaningless platforms and a
disgruntled public.

The need for a realignment of

parties along idealogical lines
becomes apparent when you
analyze the recent polls. The
combined Nixon-Wallace vote is
presently thought. to be about
60%. If Mr. Nixon did not have to
concern himself with the
Rockefellers, Lindsays, Javits, and
Romneys of his own party his
position on the issues would very
likely be more "conservative"
than it presently is.

Although Nixon is nowhere
near as extreme as the firebrand
from Alabama, many Wallace
supporters would find Mr. Nixon
a more attractive candidate. This
would all but eliminate Wallace
from the campaign and remove

Director Of Peace Corps Blames

Administrators For Campus Unrest

WASHINGTON-Peace Corps
Director Jack Vaughn predicts
continuing protest activities on
college campuses in the coming
year many school
administrators have not tuned iit

because

to the real cause of unrest among
students.

In ait article iii the September
issttc of Glamour magazine. (on
.-.alc Aug ‘10) Vaughn states: “It is
becoming clear that half ol
today's students are otit to change
the systeirr-not necessarily our
system btit their system of higher
education I Ill‘llt'Vt' they're right
in thinking it is ready for radical
overhauling."

The trouble, Vaughn believes.
stems from rlepcrsonalization of
higher education aitd failure to
recognize students as adults
capable of full participation iii
society and iii educational affairs.

The student is demanding a
personal experience, Vatigltn says,
and turns on the school
administration, “If this is to be
faculty
liberated, aitd perhaps reoriented

reversed, the must be
toward the student" the Peace
Corps director says.

He points out, “It may be that
there will be more disseitsiott on
the campus similar to the unrest
which rocked many campuses last
year unless changes iuts‘tit- iii tlic
decision making apparatus of

"The two most significant
results of our studies," says
Vaughn, “were tltc finding that
revolutionaries totaled
four per cent of the

the real

student population aitd that one
third of the students were activists
who waitt to work for reform
within the system.”

Vaughn, the
surveys indicated that 11 percent

students are “true

comprisi- the leadership ot iiiost
campus protest activities.
However, only four per cent of all

students are so

radical or

considered out of eoiitmunication
with society.“

“There is another Iltl per cent
committed to social and political
action but who feel that their
goals cart be attained within
existing systems," Vaughn says
“Add to these groups an

estimated 10 per cent whom we
cart call constructivists--those
committed to social and political
action, but who Itave not engaged
in dissent or protest movements."

This adds up, Vaughn says, to
approximately 50 per cent of the
student body committed to some
form of ranging
doing

social action,

from violent protest to
community volunteer work.

Vaughn describes the :30 per
cent who arc still uncommitted to
social action as “the remnant of

He points out that the Harris
survey shows a drop iit interest in

“But on the other hand, the

the very real threat he now pout.
A new Republican Party
organized along conservative lines
could include such GOP members
as Reagan, Nixon, and Goldwater
and Democrats like Connellly of
Texas.

Similarly, the Democratic Party
could be reorganized along liberal
lines combing the
McCarthy-Kennedy Democrats
with the Rockefeller-Joints
Republicans. The big question of
course is, What to do with LBJ
and HHH? I believe that the
Johnson-Humphrey type of
politics are anachronistic and will
soon entirely vanish from the
American political scene.

The New Left is disgusted with
their interventionist foreign policy
and the right with their “New
Deal type" domestic programs,
not to mention the criminal
eoddling Supreme Court decisions

supported by the current
administration
Much of the 30%-32%

Humphrey is receiving in the polls

is a negative vote cast by liberals

who view him as the lesser of two
evils. Whether or not you agree

with the New Left (and I don :t!)

you must recognize that it is a

political force to be reckoned

with and as such should be
represented witltin the system.

With 1\‘Ic(.‘-artlty's defeat the

liberals lost their voice

There are two major advantages
to a political realignment. The
first concerns legislative
efficiency, It would be much
easier for the party in power to
pass a legislative program if they
could count on solid party voting.
Today there are too many
ideaologies within each party to
make this possible. Party
discipline in Congress is
practically nil. Too many
Congressmen and Senators vote
conscience rather than party and
rightly so.

Second, a (‘onservative Party
and a Liberal Party would insure
the voters a choice. The threat of
third parties would be lessened.
lloitcsty would be injected into
the campaign. Today if you want
to be President you have to be a
hypocrite;saying one thing to
please a wing of the party, but
believing something else.

A reorganization of parties is the
only way to save the two-party
system If it is not done, I fear the
emergence of even more third
parties aitd splinter groups. Under
conditions governing,
