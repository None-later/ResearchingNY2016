Hellman Theatre on a reserved seat basis.

Gallery Features Works

By Villamil

The Art Gallery at
University of New York at Albany
has begun the 1968-69 season
with four concurrent exhibitions.
The showing includes one-man
exhibitions by the painters Rafael
Villamil and Donald Ogier along
with a selection of photographs
entitled “Guggenheim Fellows in
Photography."

The fourth exhibition, prints
from the collection of the
Museum of Modern Art, is called
“The Artist As His Subject."

The work of Rafael Villamil has

been exhibited in his native
Puerto Rico and in one-man
shows at the Pennsylvania

Academy of Fine Arts and at the
Pan-American Union. While
contemporary in its use f
irregularly shaped canvas, found
objects, and electric light bulbs, it
is spiritually related to indigenous
Latin religious folk art.

Mr. Villamil now lives and
works in Philadelphia. Donald
Ogier, who is presently a teaching
assistant at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, has
exhibited widely in the United
States and in Europe where he
worked as a Fulbright Fellow in
1962. Mr. Ogier calls his current
work “three dimensional
painting. U

It combines found
collage, and acrylic points on
canvas and wood. “Guggenheim

represents the work of 29
recipients of John Simon

Guggenheim Foundation
fellowships in photography. The
foundation's first award was given
in 1937 to Edward Weston. The
exhibition includes such other
well known names as Ansel
Adams, Bruce Davidson, Robert
Frank, Dorothea Lange, and G. E.
Kidder Smith.

Artists' self portraits and their
interpretations of fellow artists
are the materials for “The Artist
As His Subject." The prints are
the work of fifty artists from
eleven countries.

‘2001’i    Visual Triumph

Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A
Space Odyssey” opens with a
dawn like you've never seen: with
profound majesty the sun slowly
lifts itself over our planet while
the first bars of "Thus Spake
Zarathustra” thunder across the
soundtrack.

The film closes with a
spaceman-embryo hovering
luminescently above the earth.
Between these two images pulses a
beautifully designed, precisely
executed movie that is almost
continually startling and
challenging.

At “The Dawn of Man" apiin
creatures subdued by indifferent

Nature discover a mysterious
black slab emitting strange
vibrations. almost immediately

afterward the apes discover that a
bone can be used as a weapon.
The bone spins into the air in

close-up; cut—Kubrick's most
explicit point—to a spacecraft
orbiting the earth. In 2001

another slab has been found on
the moon, its emanations
suspected to be from Jupiter.

The authorities never discoVer
the meaning of these monoliths,

Workshop For Area

The children’s Theatre unit of
the department of speech and
dramatic art at the University
offers a creative dramatics
workshop for children aged four
through 12 this fall.

The program will begin October
5, continuing through January 11
on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to
noon.

Patricia B. Snyder, director of
Children's Theatre, said that
creative dramatics enables a child
to see new relationships and to

prodigious success? Even
Mantovani is not sure. “I don't
understand why we are the only
light orchestra in the world doing
this sort of thing ."

Most of the secret undoubtedly
lies in his finely toned
orchestrations. Each facet, like a
diamond, may display a spectrum
of intermingled iridescences, but
as the orchestration turns it is also
a musical prism: the whole is
clearly, almost crisply, delineated
until not one shimmering
spectrum winks out, but a whole
constellation of them; flecks of
warmth among the coldcr musical
transparencies. The whole piccc
bccomcs a sort of lri-mbling
musical canilclahrti, and at the
musical center always that clear
melody shining through. These
musical lfill1(l(‘li|llll'ilS may assume
almost any sharper-it's “('ulch a
Fallitig Star" in one and “Wonder
Who's Kissing Hter Nl W" in
another, but invariably tlicy are

precision, they will be

and then again, those perfect

Mantovani--evitlently, endlessly
present-and it seems likely so to
remain.

but finally, in one of the most
controversial sequences in recent
films, a spaceman and the
audience do.

Visually, the film is a triumph.
The space sequences are delicately
balanced bullets, in which Kubrick
has orchestrated rotary, lateral,
and torque movement in ways
that, while formally beautiful,
also attempt. to einematically
indue a feeling of weightlessness.
(Sit as close as you can; from the
second row, it’s quite something.)

Similarly, steep camera angles
and off-balance framing further
dislocnte our sense of position,
until tip and down mean nothing.

Kubrick has also stringently
controlled his color schemes to
intensify his material: for
instance, against the blue-black of
space throbs a yellow‘and-red
spacesuit; the space station's
interior is a frosty white-on‘white
with pink furnishings; the eye of
HALQOOO, the computer, is a hot
red-yellow-white disc. The tightly
integrated colors strengthen the
impact of the blazing torrent of
light and colornear the film's end.

Aside from its
magnificent kinetic

merit as a
experience,

Creative Dramatics

Children

increase his understanding of
others and gives him a new insight
of himself. Each semester the
children will see a production
designed for children and
produced by the students and
staff of the theatre unit.

In some cases, workshop
participants may be part of the
cast in the production. Snyder
added that the workshop is not
oriented to a final production, as
in the case of a dramatic
production, but rather with the
experiences—the activities-which
are prompted by the child‘s
imagination and guided by a
creative dramatics group leader.

She concluded, "All children
have creatiVe potential and all
should have an opportunity
outside of the usual 'school‘
atmosphere and that of the home
to express these potentialities.
The creative dramatics workshop
we have planned is one such
avenue."

 

“2001" is remarkable for tackling
no less a theme than the cosmic
role of man’s evolving
imagination. On Jupiter Bowman
is taught his place in the universe:
by witnessing his own decay and
death, he can realize where man ’5
life is stationed within what Pascal
called “these infinite spaces."

The space odyssey is a time
odyssey, too—from ape'man to
star-cliild-so that finally he can
turn from the earth to confront
comprehendineg the beauty of
the universe. This serious anti
intelligently treated theme,
combined with visuals of
surpassing grandeur, make “200] "
one of the most fascinating and
exciting of recent films.

Stale Presents
American Breed;

First Edition
Alan Lasker

The all university concert,
sponsored by Special Board
Events, featuring “The American
Breed" and “The First Edition"
lacked a certain “umph.”

The “American Breed" began
the evening with a medley of their
hits followed by a selection of
works that were difficult to
identify with. They tried to
perform well but their efforts
proved futile. A coordination
between the volume of their
music and their voices lacked
harmony, and their songs
contained neither catchy lyrics
nor a pulsating beat.

Their attempts to involve the
audience, which included certain
members of the audience to sing
and dance before their peers,
failed. Their songs were only
mediocre with the exception of
“Bend me, Shape me." The
“American Breed" lacked a
unique characteristic that could
set them apart from anyone of
their many competitors.

“The First Edition" proved
more entertaining. One reason
may be due to the fact that
Thelma, their lead female singer,
not only sang with an enchanting
voice but danced quite gracefully
to the public‘s satisfaction.

Their songs ranged from “You
keep Me anging n" to an

"Italian Art Song” and “What
Condition" to their closing theme
of “Mirlmv Mouse "

Newcomer Jim Handzel

The Freshmen Soccer team is
being coached by a gentleman in
his first year at Albany State.

Jim llantlzcl, a graduate of
Springfield (.‘oIIi-gi- is handling the
reins of “10 team this year as lllt‘

direction of the Varsity squad.

In addition to his duties as
coach of the frosh soccer team,
Mr. llandzcl will assume direction

 

 

 

of the Freshman Baseball team
this spring.

Whereas coaching a freshman
team is never easy, llaiitlzel is at,
even more of it disadvantage as the
turn out of bullphiyers has been
very mcngcr thus far. In a sport
such as soccer, which requires
constant running and
contact, a lack of substitutes is
particularly a disadvantage.
