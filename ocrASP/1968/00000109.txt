Fifty-Mile Swim Club
Initiated At Albany

It appears very odd,
unfortunately, that few students
and faculty are taking advantage
of the facilities of our beautiful,
new athletic building. In an
attempt to bring use of the pool
to an optimal level and at the
same time encourage personal
physical fitness, a new program
has been added to the activities
available in the physical education
building.

Under the supervision of Miss
Lynnette Martin, the Red Cross
Fifty-Mile Swim and Stay Fit
Program was begun last week in
the State swimming pool,

Any person who possesses a
reasonable swimming ability is
eligible to register for and
participate in the program

The only rules

Track Club
Step Up To

The Albany State University
track team has been elevated to
the level of a varsity sport. The
track team having operatcd on a
club basis for the past two years,
will be officially inslated on the
varsity level this spring.

Last season's track club, under
the guidance of R. Keith Muiiscy
and Mr. Brian Kclly, compiled a
creditable record in view of its
relative inexperience. Facing the
likelihood of a more demanding
schedule coupled with a division
of strength, the liltitl
should prove formidable.

Phenomenal Record

Held By Coach Munsey

The Albany Slate llarriers are
being led this year by ll, Keith
Munsey. Coach Minisey, who is in
his seventh year as mentor of
Albany's team has accumulated an
amazing dual meet record of fifty
wins and only six losses. During
his tenure, he has directed lwo
undefeated lcams, while none of
his teams has lost more than twice

in a season.
In addition lo coaching the

Varsity Cross-Country team, Mr.
Muiiscy also has charge of the
freshmen squad. During the
spring, he is director of the newly
formed Track and Field Club. The
Truck and Field Club which began
only two years ago is expected to
become a Varsity team this year.

Before the
Track Club 'is
Coach Munscy also
mentor of the Freshman lliiseliall
'l'ciim lot a number of years.

The fantastic
Muiisey's teams can be attributed

inception of the

steertl as

success of Mr.

to his outstanding ability to not
only recruit lop-notch runners,
but to develop their capabilities
when they arrive on campus.
Working under the handicap of

With Narrow 3-2 Victory

Saturday afternoon the Albany soccer team suffered their second straight setback at the hands of RPl iii
a real lieartbrcaker 3-2. The game was a real thriller with RPl getting off to a quick load on a goal by Crosby
at 9:20 of the ﬁrst period. The Danes played inspired ball throughout

Troy. But they just couldn't seem
to find the nets in the first half.
Much to their dismay, however,
Rl’l did, on a penalty kick by
Crosby. who had had a one on
one with goalie Rich Rankin until
he was tripped by Phil Kahn in
the penalty area. The goal came at
3:47 of the second/Ibis broke the
hearts of the Albany players as
they watched weeks of
preparation go down the drain.
The defense play aggressive, tough
soccer in the first half but the
forwards just didn't seem to have
the necessary drive and
determination. The first half
ended with RPI leadin-- ‘J-t‘

Part. of the game strategy had
been to handcuff ’l‘om Conroy
(Number 0) who is RPI's leading
scorer (last year he scored fifteen
times).

Albany came out of the locker
rooin a new team, for the second
half. The third period started off
innocently enough, but you could
see the marked difference in the
State players. They were
aggressive and began to push RPl
all over the field.

But RP] wouldn't be denied,
and at l0120 of the third, Lock
put their third goal in the nets on
a pass from Munkittrich that
goalie Rich Rankin could not get
control of. With absolutely
nothing to lo now, the Danes
played with reckless abandon and
finally began to upset and break
through the RPI defenses. The
game was now drawing to a close
and still Albany hadn‘t scored.

security gates and campus parking
were discussed at great lengths.

Dr. Clifton C. Thorne, Vice
President for Student Affairs,
wished to clarify the reason for the
security gates. “Their purpose is to
prevent vehicular traffic on the
pedestrian walkways and to keep
fire lanes clear."

To eliminate the problems
encountered by vendors. the gates
will be numbered. This will
especially facilitate the dispatching
of taxis.

'l‘horne also outlined the
procedure used by delivery men.
He commented that all local
vendors were contacted before the
gates were constructed.

“We feel it is more important to
protect 1238 kids in the Quad than
to have the pizza man deliver to
your door," concluded Thorne.

Discussion of the gates led into
discussion of campus parking.
"The parking problem on any
campus is insoluable," remarked
Collins.

Collins revealed that a two story
semi~underground parking lot is in
the future plans. The lot will be
between liidian Quad and the
Chemistry building.

One student present at the
conference commented on thc
conditions in the Colonial Quad
parking facility. He brought it to
Collins attention that there are
only a few lights, holes in the lot.
and an inconvenient ramp leading
into the lot.

His remarks were well taken but
he was told that the parking facility
was only temporary. Therefore,
the University could not justify
putting too much money into
rcpairofthe lot.
