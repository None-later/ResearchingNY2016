HHH Gains 

In Poll

NEW YORK (UPD—Vice
President Hubert H. Humphrey
is showing his first marked gain
in popularity since he won the
Democratic presidential nomin-
ation according to a new poll of
registered voters.

Sindlinger & 00. reported
Tuesday that 28.0 per cent of
the voters it questioned Friday
through Monday said they
supported Humphrey. This com-
pared to 25.9 per cent in a
similar poll a week earlier.

The new poll showed RVE-
PUBLICAN Richard M. Nixon
still leading with 36.6 per cent
but this was a drop from the
37.4 per cent of a week earlier.

Third party candidate George
C. Wallace also dropped in
popularity. He was supported by
17.1 per cent of those ques-
tioned, compared to a peak of
18.5 per cent a week earlier.

Sindlinger, which specializes
in market analysis, questioned
1,724 adults in 48 states in its
most recent poll, conducted by
telephone. It said 1,088, or 63.3
per cent of those questioned,
said they were registered and
planned to vote.

The firm prepares its polls
for the 3 institutional subscri-
bers to the Sindlinger Daily
Survey. Telephone numbers are
chosen by a computer pro-
grammed to make a random
sampling 0 f representative
Americans.

Non-union teachers walked
out of classrooms in the

To Return

By ROBERT EVANS
NEW YORK (UPI)—A federal

judge _Tuesday night ordered
striking Iongshoremen backito
work in ports from Maine to

Texas under provisions of the

Taft-Hartley labor law.
The order came when Pres-
ident Johnson ordered Atty.

Gen. Ramsey Clark to seek an
injunction under the labor act

that would send the 75,000
members of the International
Longshoremen '5 Association

(ILA) back to their jobs for an
80-day cooling off period.

Judge Sylvester J. Ryan
issued the temporary restrain-
ing order pending a hearing on
the injunction, which he set for

Longshoremen Ordered

The injunction was sought by
the President when a presiden-
tial board of inquiry set up to
look into the dispute reported
the “parties unable to reconcile
their differences over the
exceedingly difficult issues."

Federal mediators will work
with both sides in an effort to
resolve their differences.

The board of inquiry was set
up Monday . when the [LA

A union spokesman said the

[LA “will take a look" at the

Cornell Grad Students
Feel Draft Pressure

ITHACA, N.Y. (UPI) — The
lifting of draft deferments for
graduate students already is be-
ing felt at Cornell University.

This week’s issue of the Cor-
nell News Letter reported pre-
liminary figures indicated a
drop of approximately three
per cent this fall, or a little
than 100 students, from

more
the university’s 1967 graduate
registration.

David A. Warren, associate
registrar, was expected to is-

sue official figures next week.
While the enrollment decrease
is relatively small, it reverses
a five—year trend at Cornell, an
article in the university - pub-
lished news letter said.

It quoted W. Donald Cooke,
dean of the Cornell Graduate
School, as predicting the uni-
versity may lose as many as
200 more graduate students at
the end of this term, as stud-
ents lose their present draft dc-
ferment, and an equal or even

greater number in June.
“Considering graduate educa-
tion as a national resource, the
teachers and the facilities will
remain at the present level, but
the input-students--may not be
there," Cooke said. “On a short-

range basis, there will be no
noticeable loss but on a long
range there will be fewer

Ph.D.'s and, if the situation per-

sists, we will be in'serious
trouble.“

Cooke said that, nationally,
engineering schools will be

hardest hit, partly because in-
dustry competes strongly for en-
gineering undergraduates.

He said some students may
turn to industry in hopes of get-
ting draft defermcnts because
of their jobs. Others, he said,
may do so because of a dwindl-
ing number of government-fund-
ed graduate fellowships.

Cornell publishes the news
letter every other Week for facv
ally and staff members.

By LEE LEONARD

SCRANTON, Pa. (UPl)—For-
mer Vice-President Richard M.
Nixon brought his campaign for.
the White House to ‘Scranton
country’ Tuesday, promising
new leadership and peace both
abroad and at home.

Nixon told a cheering throng
of supporters at the Scranton-
Wilkes Barre Airport that it is
time for a change from the pol-
icies of the Johnson administra-
tion. The estimated gathering
of 3,000 voiced their approval.

“Shall we continue the pres-
ent policies of the past four
years?" the former vice presi‘
dent asked the partisan crowd.
"No!" they shouted back in un'
ison.

“I'm proud to be in Scranton
country,” Nixon said here.
In Erie, Nixon had noted he
was in the home territory of
Gov. Raymond P. Shafer.

An even larger crowd of
about 5,000 met Nixon at the
Erie Airport cheering the Re-
publican nominee on as he de-
livered a fist pumping speech
for an end to crime in the
streets and an honorable settles
ment of the war in Vietnam.

Colorful high school bands
and ‘Nixon girls' in their white
skimmers furnished a noisy
tribute as the candidate ad-
dressed them under the warm
autumn sun, a brisk breeze
whipping through his hair.

A contingent of Pennsylvania
Republican leaders made 5the
two stops in the Commonwealth
with Nixon. They included State

Chairman John C. Jordan,
State Atty. Gen. William C.
Sennetl, State Revenue Secy.
Warner M. Depuy, and various
congressional and legislative
candidates.

Sharer introduced Nixon as

u

an individual who has the
qualities of leadership—the next
president of the United States."
The crowds threw confetti
and cheered “We want Nixon."
They held aloft such signs as
“We’re fixin to elect Nixon.”
"Nixon's the one."

Small gatherings of anti - es-

trated the crowds at each rally,
but their protests \vej largely
drowned out.

They held up placards read‘
ing “Stop the war," “Muzzle
Agnew," and “To vote for Dick
is to be sick.”

Nixon touched all bases in his
speeches, attempting to appeal
to the old, the young, the wage
earners, those who want law
and order and those who want
peace in Vietnam.

“We need new leadership in
this land of ours," Nixon said.

“Stop the war," yelled some
demonstrators, but they were
drowned out by cheering Nixon
backers.

“I'm proud to have been part
of an administration that ended
one war and kept America out
of war for eight years," the
GOP nominee said in Erie.

The Portside

by Carol French

 

 

IFine Way lift is

A revolutionary is quietly
resolved upon necessary
fundamental social change by any
means necessary.

Having thought seriously about
revolution, he would prefer
peaceful to violent change, but he
is prepared at all times to defend
himself. He will suit the defense
to the attack, but will, as all
normal organisms, seek to
preserve himself.

He does not believe that the
end justifies the means, for he
knows that dialectically the end
and the means stand in relation to
each other. A good end can
become bad if the means are evil.

Nevertheless, if the path to
social justice lies through
revolution, he is willing to see it
through, for by that road lies an
end to war and racial oppression.

A revolutionary is patient when
events limit his activity. He does
not substitute himself for forces
which are absent. He does not
substitute the overture for the
drama. He knows that seizing an
administration building is not
taking state power. ’

He knows, even, when seizing
the ad building would advance the
struggle and when it would not.
And when no gain can be made,
he is not concerned about how
many other schools have done it.

A revolutionary is a disciplined
person, willing to put his goal first
and himself second. He does not
push himself ahead, but works to
push his goal ahead. He is not

afraid to be thought "chicken" or
“liberal” when good sense
dictates.

A revolutionary is objective,
able to size up the situation and
determine the possibilities
independent of his desires. He
knows when to fight and when
not to: what battles are to br
fought and what ignored. He
knows whom to fight and whom
not to. He does not go to jail
unnecessarily, nor does he fight
unnecessary battles of all sorts.

He supports and defends all
other fighters in the struggle, in
his group or not, in so far as he
can without surrendering his own
perspective.

A revolutionary. finally, is a
person who yvould rather be doing
something else. He is a reluctant
revolutionary.

Hurts Talks;

Humphrey Attacks Wallace

By United Press International

Richard M. Nixon said
Tuesday that Hubert H. l-lum-
phrey may have endangered the
Paris talks with his promise to
halt the bombing of North
Vietnam if Hanoi would give
some evidence of willingness to
chcsculate the war.

Nixon said no presidential
candidate should play the
“trump card“ of a bombing halt
because this would encourage
North Vietnam to stall the
Paris talks in hopes of getting a
better deal out of the next
administration.

“I will still hold my position
that as long as the negotiations
in Paris hold out any reasonable

hope of success...l will not
indicate what I might do if
those negotiations failed, be-

cause that will assure that they
fail,“ Nixon told newsmen in
Detroit.

Humphrey, campaigning in
Knoxville, Tenn, sharpened his
attack on third-party candidate
George C. Wallace, calling him
an "apostle of hale and racism"

who threatens to topple the
American political system. He
compared Wallace '5 candidacy

to the rise of Hitler in prewar
Germany.

Humphrey acknowledged that
Nixon opposes Wallace, but said
the GOP candidate “has within
the ranks many persons who
make precisely the same appeal

who have led the reactionary,
extremist forces in America for

Dear Fascist:

The political conventions

showed that both parties have
decided to adopt peaceful
oriented platforms. Still there is
death and brutality in Vietnam,
although most will agree that the
complexion of the war is different
from a year ago. What is your
present position on the war?

Dear Teller~of~the~Wny~IHs1
There has been much
controversy of late over the usage
of marijuana. l have conducted a
small-scale study and have found
out that pol is habit-forming.
However, so are cigarettes. So, in
your opinion, what is the
difference between cigarette-
smoking and marijuana-smoking?

Name Withheld

Dear Mr. Withheld:
Cigarette-smoking may be
hazardous to your health.

Dear Friend:

A recent NEW YORK TIMES
survey shows Nixon holding over
300 electoral votes, Wallace with

about 50, and Humphrey Ic- than
that. How do you account for the
great disparity in the present

candidates"popularity?
AFascist

Dear Friend:

Wallace only gets strong

support in the South.

Dear Non-Intellectual:

What do you consider the
chances of Senator Muskie and
Governor Agnew opposing one
another in 1972?

An Intellectual

Dear Miss Intellectual:

Who's Who?
Dear Thing:

I find it hard to believe that
some members of the Far Right
can take a get-tough policy in the
Middle East (favoring Israel), and
at the same time give adherence to
George Lincoln Rockwell. Can
you explain?

Dear Sir:
That's absurd! George Lincoln
Rockwell is dead.

My final letter needed no reply.

Dear Unspeakable:

I hate you bigots. You're all
alike with your prejudices and
categorizing of people. If I had a

world of your ilk, so people like
me could spend our time loving
