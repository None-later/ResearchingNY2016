State Quad Provides
Varied Entertainment

The most dynamic, new
happening of the year is the
programming currently being
developed by State Quad
Productions under the auspices of
the State Quad Program Council.
A continually growing staff of
Quad residents have turned the
question of what‘s happening this
weekend into an entertainment
bonanza.

Franklin R. Levy, the
producting director of the
organization. stated that “When
we organized S.Q.P. we had the
desire to provide residents of our
quadrangle as well as the entire
university community with the
ﬁnest entertainment. With that
aim and a tremendously dedicated
staff we have been able to achieve
a little of what we hoped for.

The major program. already in
operation on State Quad. is the
Tower East Cinema which every
weekend shows an outstanding
motion picture at a very nominal
fee. enabling students to view
such films as “A Man for All
Seasons“ and "Blow Up." 'l‘ower
East will also be installing a
cinemascope screen and
projection system later this
month.

in the field of drama, the first

production of the year. “Slow
Dance on the Killing Ground."
goes into rehearsal Oct. 6 with
performances scheduled for Nov.
22 and 23. Paul Wright. Miriam
Schneider. and Paul Hashmall
have the leads in the play written
by William Hanley.

For the vast majority of
students who don't have the
opportunity to visit New York
City. S.Q.P. has brought a little of
N.Y.S. to them. This past Sunday.

Kurt Peterson and Victoria
Mallory of “West Side Story"
sang. danced. and discussed

theatre with the residents of State

Quad.
On Sunday. Oct. 20. David
Black. the producer of

Broadway‘s “George M." will be
the guest of the Quad as well as
one of the show's leading ladies.
Mr. Black will discuss the role of
the Broadway producer with the
students at -l:00 p.m. in the Flag
Room.

Plans are starting to be
organized for a national company
of oneI of the Broadway musicals.
such as "Fiddler On The Roof."
to perform on campus. A spring
concert anti more special guests
are also in the works.

America Hurrah ’

Comes To Page
Ticket sales for “America

Hurrah.” Jean-Claude van ltallie’s
three once—act plays begins today
at the State University Theatre
boxol’l’ice at the Campus Center.
All seats are $1.50. The
performance on Saturday evening
October 12 at Page Hall is being

sponsored by the Dramatics
Council.

The offering is one of the
longest ruitning off-Broadway
productions for a non-musical
play in theatrical history. It

played New York's Pocket
Theatre for eighteen months and
in London for eight weeks. The
often controversial satirical plays
have met with unanimous plaudits
from professional critics on both
sides of the Atlantic. Irving
Wardle of the London Times
called "America Hurrah.“ “The
finest product of American
theatre since ‘West Side Story',"
Boston critic. Kevin Kelly
describes the production as “a
Hurricane of Horrors.

Mr. van ltallie. a Harvard
graduate. perhaps best describes
his own attitude of the theatre in
general by saying, “the whole
structure that man in the
twentieth century world has
devised for himself to live in
seems to me. and to others. to be
sitting on a foundation wlicih is
out of whack, to me. and to
others. to be sitting on a
foundation which is out of whack.
tilted. inadequate for human
beings. alienated from a sane idea
of being alive.

 

THE 'AMERICAN llURRAIl’ by Jeanﬂaude van ltallie is a series of tltrce one-act plays. It begins

today; seats are $1.50.

Consistently

"Rachel. Rachel” is peculiarly
American in its sympathy, verging
at times on pity, for the
inarticulate loneliness of those
people leading lives of “quiet
dcspcrations." Rachel is an
elementary teacher suffocated by
a clinging mother. a dreary small
town. childhood inhibitions, and a
bare. friendless existence. The
frenzy of a revival meeting strips
her psyche to the bone. revealing
a hunger for love. When a city
type slicks into town. and she is
drawn into a summer affair. only
to be dumped at summer's end.
bruised and apparently pregnant.
The pregnancy is found to be only
a cyst. but in an upbeat ending
with Hollywood's fingerprints all
over it, she tells off Mother and
decamps for a new town and a
Fresh Start.

Dean Emphasizes Cultures

In Address To TRYADS

by Lauren Ostrttnder
liccausc oi the tltilcrcnt cultures
rcprt-scntt-d on today's campuses.
studcnts cannot be characterized
Into mic group having
traits.

This was a main idea presented
by Sorrcll E. Chesin. Associate
Dean of Students. to the TRYADS
(Trinity Young Adults religious
organization].

it was last Sunday when Dean
Chesin met with this group at the
Trinity Methodist Cliruch of
Albany.

Chesin. in his usual manner.
sewed into his talk many quips of
humor which relaxed the group of
about fifty and paved the way to
the many points he was about to
make.

Chesin stated that many
overlapping cultures are present on
today's campuses. All students are
unique and cannot be said to be all
alike.

He went on to name four general
categories of college people. These
categories can be thought of as
subcultures.

The academic sub-cultrue
contains students who are at
college to learn while those in the
collegiate subculture attend
college to have a good time and to
cnjoy tltemsclvm

'l‘wo sub-culture groups art- the

certain

vocational sub-culture. students
who are prnpariiig for a specific job
and lltt' non~coiiftirnitst group
which st-cks individuality.

To understand what is
happening on today's campus.
Chesin went oti. one has to look
back to the last decade.

Students that were iii college in
the 50's were. for the most part.
horn during the depression or were
Gl's from World War II.

Because of this. most of these
students would belong to the
vocational or the collegiate
sub-cultures, These students would
be found to be self-centered.
contented. socially oriented.
contented. and apathetic.

Now Chesin compares this group
tti the students of the (50's. These
men and women are post war
children.

Because the country is affluent
and liberal. these students do not
ltave to worry about the basic
needs such as food. clothing. and
shelter. The basic needs were it real
worry to those who knew them
during the depression.

Because of the lack of worry
about these basic needs. students
of the 60's began to think about
society and how it is set up.

Rebellions for civil rights and self

government thus licgin,

Albany has previously heard the
call from grad students for an
organization to represent them in
school affairs.

Last year a detailed constitution
was presented but never passed
because of insufficient election
returns as deﬁned in that
constitution.

This year. a less detailed edition
is to be presented with hopes of
ratification so a Graduate Student
Association can be formed.

Thanks to Activities Day.
interested new and returning
students were given a glimpse into
the varied activities and groups
functioning on campus.

One of the booths there was for
Primer. a campus literary
magazine first pttblished in 1943.
Primer has always published
studcnt essays. prose. and poetry.
'l‘l s year we have increased our
stalf and we are also accepting
photos or pelt and ink drawings
that accompany literary pieces.

Pot-ms in a foreign language can
also be printcd, 'l‘ranslations can
be printed next to the original.

Any student in the University
can submit material to Primer.
You need not be affiliated with
the English dept. to be published.

They then become involved
with the technical process of
printing. They proofread the

galleys. paste up the issue. and do
final corrections on galleys.

Each semester's issue of Primer
is a result of the creative efforts of
students on campus and
journalistic efforts of the Primer
staff.

if you are interested in working
for Primer or want further
information you can call Babs
