Of

 

Collins

 

It was with unqualiﬁed surprise that we heard of
the plans of President Evan R. Collins to leave from
the Presidency of this University. He has become such
an integral part of the life at this University during
the past nineteen years, that it does not seem possible
that this year will be his last among us as President.

This school has been fortunate in its 125 years to
have had several Presidents who have been, in their
time, on a par with President Collins: President
Brubacher, who served from 1915 to his death in
1939, was described as “courteous, sympathetic,
kindly, generous-minded, dignified, and yet human;"
Principal Page (1844-18), who was described as
peerless and above the many excellent men ot his
time who had held similar notions; President Milne
(1880-1914), who, too, with untiring efforts,
administered the school through a major building
period, liach accomplishment of these past
Presidents, when combined, only partially relIect tlte
wealth in the eleventh President of this school, livan
R. Collins.

It has often been said that the administration of
this University is more liberal than the students. In
most instances this statement is true. If anyone is

responsible for this situation it is Evan ('ollins. He is

the one who has anticipated the student and his

demands. It is he who has been able to establish the
changes within this institution to enable it to mature
in a responsible manner.

His policy has not been to force outmoded
administrative methods on students and faculty
unwilling to accept them.

He has maintained a contact with the student body
that is closer than that held by many junior college
presidents. The now traditional Monday afternoon
Conference with students held by the President was a
result of this close contact with the student body.
Some years ago the President was speaking at the
“Golden liyc" when someone suggested that he hold
news conferences for the students. ('ollins took up
the idea, and the Monday (‘onference was a rcstilt.
The conference has become such an important part of
the Presidents's schedule, that it takes precedence
over all but his most important appointments,

Perhaps the greatest tribute to the President is the
fact that he has served during a period of transition
that would have forced less men to capitulate.

livan ('ollins‘ was the only President in the State
University System who. as the established head of a
small tcat'hers' college, directed that Institution to
become a full fledged University.

Although we wish that President (‘ollins would

continue to serve as ottr President, the decision is his.

The action that it takes to obtain the

Pueblo

To the Editor,

I have just read the first copy
of the ASP for this year and was
shocked to learn of the statement
by Central Council calling for the
United States to pay ransom for
the return of the Puebloa'a crew
and to officially apologize to the
government of N. Korea "even if
the Pueblo wai. seized illegally on
the high seats." I think this

   

American government would-if it
followed Central Council's
plan-merely be rewarding piracy
and encouraging more of it: the
prestige of the United States
would then reach an all time low.

To counter such sentiment,
Albany State Young Americans
for Freedom (Y.A.F.) is
circuiating on campus a petition
from the National Committee on
Responsible Patriotism.
reaffirming support “to the
government of the United States
of America in any honorable

immediate freedom of the crew of
the USS. Pueblo from prison in
Communist North Korea." The
petitions will then be sent to the
National Committee and
forwarded to the President.
Y.A.I". asks all members of the
University Community to sign this
petition at our literature table in
the Campus Center. This drive,
which is being conducted
nationwide, has a goal of million
signatures. Thank you.

Sincerely, David A. Pietrusza

permanent motion picture theatre,
the Tower East Cinema. Located In
the Quad’s Flag Room, it has
scheduled some of the finest
motion pictures for showing thin
year. To date it has been sold out
for every performance. On the
screen this Saturday evening Is
“The Alamo," a highly praised
reenactment of the seige of this
legendary shrine. The color film
has a huge cast headed by John
Wayne, Richard Widmark,
Laurence Harvey, Richard Boone,
and Frankie Avalon.

The film, which was made early
in the sixties, has never been shown
on television and hasjust finished a
second swing through the movie
houses. The ten million dollar film
is an exciting mixture of music,
romance, drama, and plenty of
action.

Admission is 50 cents. In the
following weeks, the Tower East

Cinema will present “The
Umbrellas of Cherbough,” “A
Patch of Blue," and “How To

Steal A, Million. "

f Barbara Streisand Provides

Sparks In ‘Funny’ Film

The fall movie season promises
to be chuck full of musicals-some
based on original material, others
based on recent Broadway
productions. The film version of
"Funny Girl,“ the story of Fanny
Brice, began this musical movie

parade.

“Funny Girl" is hilariously
funny at times, unashamedly
corny at other times, and

marvelously entertaining all the
time because of Barbra Streisand.

Barbra Streisand, fighting her
own image of bitchincas and
kookiness, is never once Barbra
Streisand, but is constantly Fanny
Brice. In the finale, with a stark
black backdrop, Barbra Streisand
sings her heart out as Fanny Brice
would do, making the audience
sense her suffering and pain.
Streisand‘s total awareness of the
lyrics of “My Man" produces this
effect, not the tears running down
her cheek.

“Funny Girl" is by no means
perfect, however. Omar Sharif
turns in a poor acting job for a
poorly written part. The audience
cannot help but feel he is too
polite, too gentlemanly, and too
suave for the Brooklyn born
Funny. There is also much too
much of Sharif in the second act,
when the movie stops being a
musical and becomes a soap opera
barely worthy of Peyton Place.

Other supporting characters are
fine. Kay Medford, playing
Fanny‘s mother, knows just. when
to can the Jewish mother act.
Walter Pidgcon plays Ziegfeld as

those who never knew him would
expect him to be, and Anne
Francis makes a beautiful Ziegfeld
girl. It is a shame that this fine
supporting cast is given so little to
do when Sharif has so much.

The music for “Funny Girl,"
including three new songs written
especially for the movie version,
depends upon Barbra Streisand
quite a bit.

“Peoplc,‘ an overrated song, is
absolutely haunting as Streisand
sings it on an empty Brooklyn
street. “Don't Rain on My
Parade" is given a certain
electricity by Streisand, singing in
a railroad station, a taxi cab, a
train, and a tugboat floating past
the Statue of Liberty. In fact, one
doesn’t notice the Statue until the
first act curtain has come down.
Yes, Barbra Streisand even
upstagcs the Statue of Liberty.

The musical numbers contain a

minimum of dancing, but Herb
Ross has staged them so
imaginatively that dancing is not
only unnecessary but evdn
superfluous. "The Swan," whicn
opens with a beautiful ballet scene
and later becomes a vehicle for
Fanny Brice's comedic touch, is
badly mutilated, l-Ierb Ross'
staging of this number is fine, but
the cutting editor ruins what
could have been one of the better
scenes in a dramatic second act.

After muddling through a tear
stained look at Sharif and
Streisand playing Mr. and Mrs.,
the movie comes to its downbeat
ending. Unlike the lucky Eliza
Dolittle and Dolly Gallagher Levi,
Fanny Brice doesn't win her man
in a show stopping finale. The
tragi~comic figure goes out on
state and entertains her one true
love-her audience.
