Bound

by Jim Winslow
Assistant Sports Editor

 

 

Tom told me that the first column is the hardest
and I believe him. To add to my misery it is the beginning of the

semester and I really have nothing to talk about yet.

Nothing has taken place in the realm of sports thus far; the gym has
been relatively empty - except for that abortion billed as a concert last
Friday night. It's a great facility for basketball games but I couldn’t

understand a word uttered by either group.

Probably tnore of a paiit that the concert itself was tltc hassle to get
tickets. The computer hadn’t processed my date’s student tax card yet
and those people at the table In the campus center wouldn't take her

word that she Iiad paid. Attd she‘s so innocent lookirigl

Over the years, student tax has been a constant problem. Now, there

is a dirty runtor that we will have to have a tax card ill order to use the

gym facilities. I asked around earlier this week and foririd that it was no

rtimor. It was true!

I did sotnc checking to get tlte whole story aan was impressed with

what i found. I had always tltoitglit that the gym was a state owner],

operated. and funded venture. Not so. This year. strtdettt tax will buy

$3000 worth of equipment for use by the uttiversity community. It will

also provide a $100,000 budget for intercollegiate sports (men and

women).

Beyond these, student tax will he providing more than $|2000 for

paying the individuals required to keep the gym open; these ittciudc

twenty-seven student assistants wltose jobs rrtn from issue and cage

managers to life-guards and office clerks. In addition to thsc.

inmtmerable men and women are entployed as officials for the various.
intramural sports governed by the AMIA and tire WRA. Without all ol

these the gym would never be open.

Because student tax has taken such a large part in keeping the gym

open. it seems more than fair to demand that its users he contributors

to the cause - sort of like being made to pay federal taxes before the

government will allow you to participate in the Vict Nam war.

Present plaits call for issue clerks iii the cage to ask for student tax

cards when locks, equipment, clc.. are checked ortt. If you have not

paid your student tax. don't worry. For a three dollar per semester fee

you may obtain a gymnasium privilege card which will entitle you to

use equipment. You may not substitute this card for the tax card when

playing intramural sports, though.

Any faculty members who haven‘t paid the tax may also obtain

privilege cards for themselves and their families. And for those who

Itave eight cltildrcn, all of whom love to go swimming. there is a family

plan urtder which each member of a family ritay obtain a privilege card

with the maximum fee being twelve dolltirs per family.

Now that this column is finished I can't wait for next week when I

cart think of another exciting topic with which to fill this space.

Rugby Club To Hold First
Practice Today At Three

A sport. little spoken of on the
Albany campus until this year was

Rugby. Through the impetus of

several students and a faculty
member, the sport is quickly
being heard from.

The students are Bob Shea, a
grad student who formerly played
for Fairfield University, Dave
O'Leary who played three years
of varsity rugby at Union (Iollegc,
and Tony Keaton, a junior. Mr.
Keith Dugtlalv of the Math
Department has shown much
interest in forming the sport on a
club basin,

Itugby, which takes its name
and origin from the famous prep
school in Great Britain, is played
the world over aan is
acknowledged as the link between
soccer arid our American game of
football.

Presently,

about fifteen

students have shown great interest
in beginning a team but in order
to by funded by the Strident
Association the club will have to

show that many more are Ill favor
of such a sport at State.

“We have no plans of becoming
an intercollegiate sport at present
for this is the way most rrtgby
clubs, numbering ore than three
hundred in the United States
alone, are set up," commented
Mr, Shea

“We tentatively havv two games
we cotiid play this fall They
would be against Fairl‘iclrl and
Union,"hp added. Albany Law
School and Alliain Medical
(.‘ollege also have teams and are
possiblc opponents. He Went on
to say that there are few essential
skills to the rougit sport which
cannot bc learned easily by
Americans.

The Clull'h first practice will be
today at .‘I p.m. on the baseball
practice diamond near the lake.
All interested students and faculty
members are urged to go to the
initial practice or contact Bob
Shea at Brubacher liaII, 'I72'2255.

Blount Blasts Apathy

Toward LatinAmerica

On the apathy of U.S. students
toward Latin America, Dr. Blount
of the geography dept. speaking at
a Forum of Politics meeting said,
“Here‘s an area right on our
doorstep... we should be aware of
what's in store. Students in
Mexico and South America...are
being shot."

Dr. Blourtt expressed concern
with what he feels to be “visceral
involvement" on the part of U.S.
students.

lie stated thai“the problems
which students engage Ill aren't
universal."

For example, Dr. Blount cited
the superficialin of many who
protest the war in Victnant “for
fear of being drafted."

So widely held are the
misconceptions of Latin American
affairs, claimed Dr. Blount, that
even the Alliance for Progress “is
not steeped in political realities of
today."

Biotint referred to a “lioratio
Alger" brand of riaivetc, in which
“the economist starts with all
things being equal."

Blortrtt pointed ortt tltc error in
ignoring that “not every iratioii
Iias been moving toward
capitalism." According to
Illouiit,”we must deal with
dictators; we can't export
democracy like Fords."

lie claimed that “the high
school syndrome of Latins" is still
predominant in the U.S. “To
approach an issue...qualitative
distinctions must be made."

There was no logic, according

to Blouri t, in the campus
demonstration against Dow
Corporation. which produces

“thousands of products beneficial
to titan."
‘We'd have to sue BF.

Goodrich, Lockheed Aircraft...
and all the others that help to
deliver the payload“ to protest
honestly.

“There is a place for student
activism,” said Dr. Blount.
“Student activism has to be
addressed to universalities and
principles."

Halstead Decries V.N. War,
Supports Black Control

by Vii: Loopor

Fred Halstead Socialist
Worker 5 Party Candidate for
President in twenty states, spoke
to an audience of about 350 last
Wednesday.

l'laistead was greeted by a
number of pickets from Young
Americans for Freedom when he
entered the Assembly Hall.

In his introduction, Dan
Henncn, a graduate student,
stated that i'lalstead and his
running mate Paul Boutclie
offered the only trite choice to
Nixon, an anachronism from the
Eisenhower Administration and
Humphrey, a rubber stamp of
Johnson.

llaistcad said that the tWo
central issues that are facing the
United States are the war in
Vietnam and the black ntans'
equality.

He says that we are in Victnant
to protect the investments of
American Big Business. By
fighting in Vietnam we are making
“rich men richer."

The rationale for us being in
Vietnam that the Administration
tells the American people is to
stop them there before they come
over here, and to protect the free
world.

Halstead wondered who was
going to be stopped. He stated
that China has no troops outside
of their country with the possible
exception of Tibet.

Russia only has troops near
her borders. The U.S. is the “top
imperialist policeman in the
world" and has troops all over the

program will seek to present to all
those who hold arty position in
the Strident Association, aitd to
the student body in general, an

Tire entire student body,

particularly Freshmen, are invited,
as “it is imperative that each

the factors that makes up such a
complex organization."

It is rticc to assume "that each

cogltiutttl of the existence and
function of all of the major
Student Association policies and
has sortie idea of the philosophical
and legal basis of the
organization." said Mislikiii.

The program will include

Tire war can only be in the
national interest if that interest is

According to I'lalstead, black

DebateCouncilPonders
Amer. Foreign Policy

by Gary Brown

Tuesday night the Debate
('onncii presented this year's
national question as interpreted
by Dennis O‘Brien. Resolved:
That executive control of United
States foreign policy should be
significantly curtailed.

Mr. O‘Brien's affirmative
position held that too much
power is concentrated in the
hands ofa president of the United
States.

it is the president that
determines any foreign action that
this country takes, and he chooses
which treaties and policy
decisions are made.

Congress is limited to a yes or
no vote and has no power to
initiate a change. Unless public
opinion can pressure the president
(as it has done to President
Johnson) the country must wait
four years before it can alter its
course at which point it may be in
the proverbial “teeth of the
storm."

Another factor that
demonstrates the excess of
executive power is the extreme
secrecy under which the president
functions, enabling him to make

decisions while withholding
information from tltc people and
Congress.

There were the basic points
used to undermine the negative
position. Building an alternative,
however, was quite a problem

lie proposed several courses of
action:

1. That (‘ongressional approval
is needed for the President to
engage the country in war. This
should be enforced as designated
in the Constitution.

2. That a “long run" principal
of foreign policy be suggested by
the Senate.

3. That the President consult
the Senate on “short run"
decisions that are not considered
emergencies.

4. That foreign affairs be
designated to another branch of
the government (the Senate).

5. That the president must
obtain consent of the Congress
BEFORE he sends troops to
another country.

In ethical debate form Mr.
O’Brien himself attacked his
propositions, and most of them
fell apart. They were
unsatisfactory mostly because
they lacked the efficiency and
security that centralization in the

Executive bodv affords.
In debate language, the

affirmative proposal (above) is
challenging the existing system or
the negative position.
