Vice President Hubert Hum-
phrey warned Thursday it
would be “disastrous” if George
Wallace became President in

statement of his running mate-7
Curtis LeMay.

“I am shocked and deeply
disturbed by Gen. LeMay’s

phrey said.

Humphrey made his state-
ments on LeMay's comments
concerning nuclear weaponry as

- Governor Rockefeller said
Thursday Congressman Daniel
Button of Albany is on the
“brink of re-election."

The governor, in a speech pre-
pared for a Button rally at
Union College, added that the
Republican party ill New York
State is “united for victory at
the polls next month Victory
for the Nixon-Agnew ticket and
the whole Republican slate from
top to bottom.“

The governor noted that the
rally was billed as “non-politi-
cal" for a political leader.
“Orsyou might say that this
event is non-partisan in favor of
your distinguished congressman,
Dan Button, who used to be a
newspapcrman himself."

Rockefeller also drew cheers
and applause at the mention of

an end to the present draft
system.

When the Governor said he
thought Nixon is going to end
the war, one student asked:
“How?”

Rockefeller said Nixon has not
yet said how it could be done.
Rockefeller said the draft
should be conducted as a na-
tionwide lottery willr all I‘l-ycar-

added that if a name were not
drawn tlten the young person
could go ahead and make plans
for his future rather than be

added, is inequitable “It drafts

Muskie Calls For
Lottery-type Draft

BOULDER, Colo.
Democratic Vice Presidential
nominee Edmund Muskie Thurs-
day called for a lottery-type
draft system with possible non-
military alternatives for young
men.

Muskie told a crowd of
several thousand University of
Colorado students the alterna-
tive to actual military service
would include a "broad range"
of programs, including possibly
the Peace Corps, Teacher Corps
and Vista.

Muskie proposed that l9-year-
olds be subject to a “FAIR,
AND IMPARTIAL RANDOM
LOTTERY SYSTEM,“ UNDER
WHICH THE MEN WOULD BE
VULNERABLE TO DRAFT
FOR ONLY ONE YEAR. If
they were not selected during
that one year they would not be
required to serve “unless there
was a prolonged national

(UPI)— emergency."

A I9-year-old draftee would
have the choice of serving his
time at once or waiting until lte
had finished two years of
college or vocational education.
Officer candidates could post-
pone their military service until
completion of four years of
college.

“We should give careful
consideration to permit volunta-
ry national service as an
alternative to military service."
Muskie told the orderly crowd
at his outdoor speech in chilly
SO-degree weather.

Young Inert choosing the non-
military route could launch a
road attack on poverty and the
roots of deprivation at home
and abroad, he said.

Muskie drew loud applause
when he said, “to put it bluntly,
the presejt system is unfair and
unjust."

Tigers Beat Cards
8-1, E ven Series

Lolieh dazed the St. Louis
Cardinals with a strong six-
hitter and his first Major

League homer Thursday as the
etroit Tigers defeated the St.
Louis Cardinals 8-1 to even the
World Series at a game apiece.
Lolieh, who developed a groin
infection overnight and was told
by the doctor that it might
prevent him from going all the
way, was powerful at the finish
as he allowed only two hits in
the final three innings.
Striking out nine batters in
addition to clouting his 330‘foot
homer in the third inning,
Lolieh picked the Tigers off the
floor where they had been left
in their opening game trouncing
by the Cards. Bob Gibson.
After a day off Friday, the
tied-up Series now goes to
Detroit for the third, fourth and
fifth games, Saturday, Sunday
and Monday.

triumph left him “so exhausted

But the Cards were left even

the Tigers had I3 hits, including
three homers off starter and

MYSKANIA I969 has sent the
following statement to Central
Council:

Late last year, national
educational associations
representing faculty members,
administrators, and students
proposed for adoption as a joint
statement of principle, a
“Statement on the Rights and
Freedoms of Students.”

The preamble of the statement
states that “academic institutions
exist for the transmission of
knowledge, the pursuit of truth,
the development of students, and
the general well-being of society,"
and that “free inquiry and free
expression are indispensable to
the attainment of these goals."

The statement is NOT a list of
restrictive regulations aimed at
either the student or the
administration, but rather a list of

Much of their activity is
directly traceable to pressure last

felt that in presenting only white

Professors, who decided that
