It was only a few years ago
when dorm residences were
ﬁghting women’s hours. After
the administration ﬁnally guided
the open housing proposal out
of the quagmire of student
government, the institution of
women's hours was abolished,
almost.

Freshmen women’s hours for
the first semester, signout
procedures, and locked women’s
dorms are three vestigial remains
of the old dormitory policy.

One of these remaining
policies is an awkard procedure
which we feel should be

discontinued. Why should the

Hog Call

To the editor

One individual recently said she
could not help but feel like giving
a hog call as she entered this
campus because of the presence of
our security police.

This is just one illustration of
the tendency among some of us to
refer to policemen as pigs.

i can seq absolutely no
justiﬁcation for the excesses of
Mayor Daley’s police which have
contributed a great deal to the
growth of this tendency.

Moreover, i know from
personal experience that there is a
great deal concerning the Albany
City Police which should be
corrected. However, I am against
this tendency to equate policcrnert
with pigs.

Perhaps some of us think that
this is a small point. Let us then
remember that one of the ﬁrst
steps in accepting the murder of
another human being whether he
is a black man, a Jew, a Viet Cong
or a policeman is to allow
ourselves to be convinced that he
is somehow, Somewhat less than
another human being.

is world peace compatible with
hatred of policemen in general? it

'certainly is not for such hatred is
not even compatible with peace in
our own country and indeed on
our own campus.

Moreover, we certainly cannot
claim to be against prejudice

against minority groups and at the
same time utter a blanket and
rather childish condemnation of
policemen in general in the same
breath. Such action is obviously
selfcontradictory.

We cannot hope to even begin
to improve the present condition:
in this world unless we begin
ridding our hearts of hatred. The
tendency of equating policemen
with pigs should be stopped right
now.

Gym Cards

To the editor:

1 was very interested in Jim
Winslow's coluriin of Wednesday,
October 2. ilowcver, there is one
point concerning gymnasium
privilege cards that he did not
mention or was not made aware
of.

I an not certain of the policy
for the men, but all women,
TAXJAMQGMWMGRW to
purchase privilege cards before
they can use the gym equipment
and facilities. instead of the
regular three dollar fee, tax paying
students receive a jumbo discount
of one dollar and may purchase a
privilege card for two dollars.

i feel this is extremely unfair to
those who have paid student tax.
l’m sure more than three dollars

of their $28.75 semester tax fee
goes for the physical education
program. To charge them an extra
two dollars is most unfair.

Tax paying students should be
given gym privilege cards witlt
their tax cards. if the sports and

recreation program is so short of

funds, then the fee for non-tax
paying students should be raised

Sincerely, Diane McNamara

Lacks News

To the editor,

It is very possible that this
school lacks newsworthy material.
From the articles that appeared in
the last few ASP's, I ﬁnd this
opinion very conﬁrming.

Don't get me wrong, it’s good
to have the ASP out as often as
possible (like Syracuse with The
Daily Orange ﬁve times a week),
but if it has very little to say,
bring it out two times a week.

Who needs to read the news of
the nation when it is adequately
covered in the newspapers, on the
radio, and on television.

It seems that the only
advantage of the tri-wcakly ASPs
is a more current look at SUNY‘s
sports situation, but your last
edition had next to nil in sports.

1 sincerely hope the ASP will be
better as the year goes on.

women's dorms be locked at

We can understand that the

University administration does
not want to have non-residents
wandering about a dorm after

hours. But, non-residents can
wander about the men‘s dorms

and no one complains. But
non-University people don’t
come to the dorms anyway.

The women can lock their
suite doors and remain secure.
The dorm does not need .o be
locked.

The locked door policy is a
major inconvienence to the
resident students of the
University. The women must
plan their evenings so that they
return on the hour, or halfhour
(depending on where they live).
If they miss the security guard,
then they usually do one of
three things; wail art hour out in

the weather for the guard to

reopen the doors, go to a men‘s

dorm to wait, or call up a
suitemate to open the dorm
doors.

The latter two courses of
action are deﬁnitly infractions
of dorm policies. Yet, these acts
are the only convenient courses
left open to the woman resident
if she misses her let-in.

The women are forced to
break other rules because of the
archaic regulation.

The security guard, who
spends his time going around the
quads to let the girls in, could
use this time to patrol other
areas of the campus.

Students who feel that the
locked-door policy is awkward
and unneeded should contact
the members of LAA(‘ and push
for a recommendation from the
student body asking for the end

of locked dorms.

New Yorkers are more
fortunate than most Americans.
Out of the wreckage that is 1968,
we can salvage the candidacy of
Paul O’Dwyer for Senator. We
have one last chance for a peoples'
victory this year. And that is more
than most non-New Yorkers can
say.

it is still hard to believe that he
even won the Democratic
nomination. in a three-way
contest he was considered the
third candidate.

The favored candidate was
anti-war advocate Eugene
Nickerson. Suppposedly running
second was Rep. Joe Resnick of
Ellenville; the millionaire
superhawk who based his
campaign on his hatred of Senator
Robert Kennedy and his
adoration of Lyndon Johnson,

Paul O'Dwyer was overlooked
as he ignored Resnick and drew
the line between Nickerson and
himself on the issue of Hubert
Humphrey; O‘Dwycr said he
would not support Humphrey if
the Vice President was nominated
while Nickerson said that he
would. O’Dwyer won the
primary by a wide margin and
thus the unenviable task of trying
to defeat New York's vote-pulling
powerhouse, Senator Jacob Javits.

Why O’Dwyer? Because he has
a streak of independence
unmatched by any man in
American politics. Today, while
Javits holds his nose and backs
Nixon-Agnew, O‘Dwyer cuts
himself off from national party
funds by his non-support of
Humphrey. He takes this course

because he ﬁnds Humphrey‘s
position on the war intolerable.
O‘Dwyer carries political
independence to its limits; today
he is running alone.

And yesterday? Yesterday
O’Dwyer was defending in court,
without fee, a black kid named
Ernie Gallashaw who was accused
of killing a young boy during
Brooklyn’s summer violence.
Gallashaw was innocent and
O‘Dwyer got him acquitted.

Jimmy Breslin says that
O‘Dwyer handles the kind of civil
rights cases that “Don't even get
into Negro Weeklies.“ That‘s the
kind of man he is. And that‘s also
why he rarely wins elections.

Patti O‘Dwyer has been there
whenever there has been a ﬁght
for civil or human rights. And
Patti O‘l)\vyer is a revolutionary.
in the l940's ()‘Dwyer was a
member of the American wing of
the lrgun. The lrgun was the
Jewish terrorist organization in
Palestine which played a major
role in pushing the British out of
the Middle East.

it pursued this aim by blowing
up British military bases, beating
and hanging-in-retaliationi British
officers, and making life
intolerable for Britain's imperial
army. lrish Paul O‘Dwyer saw the
lrgun as much the same as the
“Sinn Fein" which drove the
Union Jack out ofhis native land.

Moreover, iie saw the Jewish
cause asjust. O‘Dwyer says: “The
Jews simply had to have a
homeland. The six million made
that very clear." He felt that the
lsraelis would prevail against all

odds adding that: “One young.

Jew standing in an orange grove
saying ‘1 will ﬁght for my land,’ is
worth all the negotiations in the
world.”

But O‘Dwyer did not stop at
speech making to Jewish
audiences. instead, he went to
Europe and from lreland
smuggled Jewish refugees to
Palestine. He went back to New
York to defend the son of poet
Louis Untermeyer who was
caught smuggling huge caches of
weapons to lsreal, won the case,
and ﬁnally, comitting an offense
clearly indictable under Truman's
arms embargo act, qul O‘Dwyer
became a gun runner for the Jews
of Palestine.

in the Israeli war of national
liberation, a man named O‘Dwyer
was there. And as Jimmy Breslin
says, “There are about twenty
people in New York who know
this." That‘s O'Dwycr's way.

He spends his summers
defending unemployed coal
miners in West Virginia, backing
grape pickers in California and
campaigning for black candidates
in Mississipppi. in short, he has
always been there when we
needed him.

And in the year that saw the
death of Kennedy, the defeat of
McCarthy, the nomination of
Nixon and the rise of Wallace, we
need him as never before. efore
the cold winter that will be the
Nixon Administration sets in, let’s
ﬁght one last ﬁght. This time it’s
O’Dwyer's turn.

God save me if this is so.

if the University is the

We will no longer be able to

will become extinct.

can simple functions become so

anyone, even the most proﬁcient

10:00 am, when you open at
9:00 am. and you know that a
crush is coming? is it
incomprehensible for FSA to
obtain more money for Monday

impossible for them to be

When questioned about the
