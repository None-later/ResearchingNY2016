I Lost It At The Movies

 

 

 

Michael Antonioni, who
Should know about such matters
has said that a neurotic woman is
the most curious and dangerous
animal on earth.

“Belle De Jour," Louis
Bunuel‘s latest and supposedly
last ﬁlm, is about the inner works
of the female mind, but before I
tell you anymore about it, I feel
that an introduction of the master
of erotica is ill order. You migllt
just decide not to become a
customer of the mysterious Belle.

In “Un Chien Andalou" which
Bunuel co-produced with Salvador
Dali, one scene that will stay in
mind forever shows a close-up of
an eyeball being slashed wide
open by a razor blade.

“The Exterminating Angel",
which the International Film
Group will show on November
l5th, is about a nun who returns
to her dying uncle‘s farm, and
after his death she invites all the
destitutes of the village to come
and live there. They not only do
that, but they also make shambles
of the place and afterwards rape
their hostess.

One sequence of “Viridiana”
captures two lovers at the height
of their sexual act, and just as
they are about to sense
(experience) climax, the pllorrc
rings. As her lover gets up, the
woman is left in panting
frustration, and ill ilorrorlzed
wonder, we watch her as she tries
to quench her desire by sucking
the big toe of a statue of the
Virgin Mary.

Well now, what is "Belle De
Jour" all about?

We know what Bunuel shows
us, alld at times that is enough,
but at other times we are left
equally, arld frustratingly panting
for more. “Belle”, at the surface,
is the story of a fashionable, well
to do Parisian wife, who by the
afternoon is a ‘bel'..' of pleasure
for money which she has no need
of.

The question, as we Watch her
go through some mildly repulsive
experiences-such as one in which
she watches a working colleague
treat a famous gynocologist who
likes to pretend being an
incompetent butler, and
consequently gets punished by his
madam With his dusting brush--is
obviously why, but Bunuel never
tells. Undoubtedly, he doesn’t
know either, aside from the fact
that he always Iras been obsessed
by the erotic, the morbid and the
neurotic.

Visually, “Belle De Jour" is a
very attractive ﬁlm. It is Bunuel’s
first ﬁlm in color and its
excellence once and for all
disproves the accusation that
Bunuel is sloppy in his work.
Bunuel has Catherine Ileueuve» a
statuesque and rather passive
Belle. walk a tight rope between
fantasy and reality, and at times
we don't know exactly where she
is, but that dilemma is almost
passe in most avant-garde ﬁlms of
the 60’s. However, the ﬁlm
editing is so good, that we never
have problems irl placing these
fantasy-reality sequences in
proper perspective. They always
recurr.

All early one has Deneuve
“imagining” herself tied to a tree,
while a few steps away her
husband is having a discussion
with a friend wlrorrr Belle suspects
to know of her double life. Their
dialogue, as they contemplate a
herd of bulls in the distance goes:

llusband:“Do bulls also have
names, like cats?"

Friend:“Sure, the ﬁrst one is

called Remorse, and the last one is

always Expiation".

Later in the ﬁlm, when Belle is
nursing her husband who had
been shot by one of her more
possessive customers, Belle again
hears the stomping of the bulls,
along with the tingling sound of
their bells.

In another sequence, a more
vivid and morbid one, Belle sees
herself transported by a horse
drawn carriage in the company of
a death-cult worshiping aristocrat.
Later on she lies inside a casket,
while the aristocrat cries her
death.

In the ﬁnal scene of the movie,
Belle hears the carriage again and
sees it pass by twice, but there is
no one inside. It could be that she

has rid herself of her
“nightmares”.
Do I recommend “Belle De

.Iour'"? Well, I wouldn't want to
be accused of perhaps wasting
your money, and so I bring Belle
herself, to the rescue. When she
tries to explain her odd behavior,
all that she can say is: “I can't
explain it. It happens in spite of
me. I can't resist it! ~ I will pay for
my sins, but I couldn't live
without this (double life)" You
see, there is a morbid, even
irresistible fascination, that
attracts one to Birnuel. Henry
Miller has said that “they should
take Bunuel and crucify him, or at
least burn him at tllc stake. lie
deserves the greatest reward mirn
earl bestow upon man."

Actually, he is like the
disquieting howl of a coyote in
the complacent stillness of a
desert night. Ile kind of places
things in perspective.

'l‘lrat someone like Bunuel, now
(its, and at a tinle like I968 can
still do that, is most reassuring.

Concerts Questioned

Why Not Better?

by Alan Lasker

The ﬁrst University concert of
the year featured “The American
Breed" and “The First
Edition"—two mediocre groups
striving for popular recognition.

They met with little success for
the simple reason that they failed
to demonstrate any fresh, new, or
exciting “means” to establish an '
“end” that could set them apart
from their competitors.

With this in mind, I believe,
that if groups like Simon and
Garfunkel and The Doors, who
demonstrate refreshing new
sounds, vibrating beats, and
sophisticated lyrics, were to visit
our fair University, the concerts
would be worth while.

Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel
began their singing careers at the
age of thirteen. Both performers
attended college: Paul at Queens
College and Art at Columbia
where he is now a graduate
student.

Their ﬁrst chart breaking
composition was “Sounds of
Silence," closely followed by
“Homeward Bound." “I Am A
Rock," "The Dangling
Conversation," and Mrs.
Robinson." Many of their own
compositions, which combine
traditional folk with problems
that each and every one of us
encounter in our mundane affairs:
loneliness, illusions of our
existence, the pain of fleeting
time, and lack ofcommunication.

Their sophisticated style
encompasses their soft but
powerful voices. Their
overwhelming popularity, based

on record sales and concert
appearanees, must mean
something.

I can honestly say that Simon
and Garfunkel know how to “turn
on" and ‘ une in” an audience.

The Doors, a group certainly
worthy of mention, took their
name from a line by poet William
Blake about “the doors of
perception." I brought their ﬁrst
album after only hearing it once,
which is quite unusual for me.

Usually I ﬁnd myself pondering
about the record for quite a
signiﬁcant amount of time before
I even contemplate buying it.

But with the Doors this was rlot
the case. Their lrrusic, mostly
electronic, but never shallow, is
unlike any other popular rock
group. Tllelr music is diabolical,
bizarre, sensual, and acidic.

I went to their ﬁrst area
performance last year, rind I think
that one of the most demonic
things about the Doors is their
lead vocalist, Jim Morrison. On his
records, as well as ill his
performances, Ire proves to be
moody, tempcrnlcutal and
cxtrerlrely “out of it."

This not onlv provides vitirlitv

in his performance but also makes
it worth watching.

What constitutes a good
performance? The entertainers, of
course. Simon and Garfunkel and
The Doors are two such groups
that generate enthusiasm as well
as spirit. Concerts are only worth
,while when they feature
entertainers of this quality.

In reference to my last article
concerning “The American
Breed” arid “The First Edition,” I
mistakineg wrote that the Mickey
Mouse theme was sung by “The
First Edition." “The American
Breed" performed this number,
but this still does not aid their
performance in the slightest.

ltallie’s ‘TV’
Comes To Page

“TV” is the name of one of the
three one-act plays which
comprise the theatrical evening by
JeanClaude van ltallie entitled,
“America Hurrah." Coming to
Page Hall on October 12, at 8:30,
“America Hurrah" is being
sponsored by the Dramatics
Council of the State University of
New York at Albany.

Mr. van ltallie‘s “TV” satirizes
itself and the lives of the people it
reﬂects. A former writer for
television programs, Mr. van ltallie
sets his play in a ratirlg room ﬁlled
with TV sets. Three people are
hired to do nothing but watch TV
screens all day and night. The
inanities and atrocities of the
teleyision screen all pass before
these people but they are too
involved with themselves to
notice. When the play ends the
television programs and the lives
of the real people so resemble
each other it is impossible to tell
where one begins and the other
leaves off.

Tickets are available at the
Campus Center weekdays from
[0-4.

THE FRESHMEN HARRIERS

Freshmen Great Danes
OverpowerAdirondack

A huddled group of nervous,
purple-shirted young men under a
tree was the view of the Freshmen
Cross-Country team awaiting their
ﬁrst meet of the year against
Adirondack Community College.

According to their coach, Bob
Munscy, the boys were “so keyed
up to run, they could taste it."
Munscy seemed to be fairly
conﬁdent of victory against a
usually weak Adirondack team.

Lastly, he put in a word tor ()llt'
hundred percent effort, a few parts
on the back, arid the the gun went
off.

Albany went out like the devil
for the first two hundred yards,
sprinted tip the hills, gained
position on the ﬁrst turn ilrto the

wootls, and ﬂushed hy the tennis
courts witlr two miles to go III a

promising ﬂash of one hundred
percent purple shirts.

First two places went to Dennis
llackett arld Paul Holmes ofState.
Larry Wllittig was fourth, Patll
Novikowsky, ﬁfth, Rick Liesc,
cigtlr, arid Mike Peterson 10th.

The team travels to LcMoyne

F rash Soccermen Bow To
North C ounty I n Opener.

The undermanned Albany State freshman soccer team dropped itsseason opener
to North Country C.C. 5-2 Wednesday. The Albany State team consisted of sixteen men, whereas North
Country had twenty-four players. The fresh were never really in the game except for the two goal spurt
they put on at the end of the last period. The contact was rough with the bigger, stronger North Country
team doing most of the hitting. The wind was a strong factor as both teams scored at“ their goals when the

winds were to their backs.

The ﬁrst quarter, except for a
few sustained drives by Albany
was dominated by North Country.
Bart Taylor and Mike Lynn each
had ir goal and an assist for North
Country.

In the second quarter the fresh
started moving the ball a little
though they still couldn‘t manage
to score a goal, and the score
remained 2-0 at half-time.

In the third quarter the roof
fell in on the Trash as North
Country scored three times. They
scored on a goal by Bill Hoctor
and two more goals by Taylor and
Lynn.

In the fourth quarter the State
frosh finally came to life.
Although they only scored two
goals, they really started to show
signs of playing as a team. They
were moving the ball better and
really knew what to do with it;
once they got a hold of it. Both of
the goals were scored by forward
Terry Wilbert.

The outstanding players of the
game were Wilbert and goalie
Sanford Cohen who made
nineteeen saves, including a
beautiful save on a penalty kick.

‘t'hrngs might start to pick up as
the season wears on and the
players get more experience, but
if the first game is an indication of
things to come then this could be
a long season for frosh soccor.
