This seasons League I in A.M.I.A. has begun with some rather
surprising results, with the conclusion of only a short part of the
schedule a number of unpredictable events have occurred.

Certainly the most amazing occurrence was the upset of Potter Club
by Kappa Beta. In scrimmages prior to the season, KB showed a
potential for scoring, but seemed to be somewhat unsure of how their
offense would be arranged when the ﬁrst game rolled around. While
they didn’t overpower Potter with their offense, KB was able to mount.
a sustained drive for their one touchdown.

Potter Club, which won the league last year, was a pre-season pick to
repeat this year, eventhough they lost their quarterback and primary
receivers through graduation. In their ﬁrst game, while tltere were times
when their offense seemed to sputter, they did manage to register
thirteen points on the scoreboard. In scoring these points, it appeared
that Jim Waibel was beginning to jell at quarterback. KB, however,
stymied him throughout most of the game. Consequently, the future
success of Potter for the year is difﬁcult to predict.

With their defeat of Potter Club, KB seems to be a force to be
reckoned with in coming games. Another team which would appear to
be a strong favorite is APA. Albeit‘they have not yet played a league
game, APA has almost their entire team from last year returning from
last year's squad which barely lost out to Potter; as a result, they are
sure to have a well-balanced, welLorganized team.

Another squad which has got off to a good start is the team from

Waterbury Hall. In their ﬁrst game,

they beat a bigger and somewhat

more seasoned Tappan Hall team. It is usually difﬁcult for a dorm to
organize an effective team in so short a time, but the Waterburyites are
being led by grad students and resident assistants who have played
League 1 one ball in past years. It appears that Waterbury, too, will
present top-notch football competition for the rest of the league.

Tappan Hall, with the nucleus of the team which won League 1 1 last
year, has yet to show an effective offense, but they no doubt will
become more powerful as the season progresses.

The victim of Potter’s ﬁrst victory, Sigma Tau Beta, is another team
which has yet to prove itself in League 1 competition. While their
offense looked effective at times they were unable to push the ball
across the goal line. In addition, their starting quarterback wasinjured in
the third quarter and will be out of action for an undetermined length

of time.

Upsilon Phi Sigma, who lost to Kappa Beta in their ﬁrst encounter, is
a team which seems to lack the ingredients necessary to establish a
winning season in League 1. Their squad, while they possess the
competitive spirit, appears to lack the well-balanced attack necessary to

win consistently.

The Nads, a perennial entry in League 1, made up entirely of
independents, is a team which always manages to co-ordinate into a
strong unit. Although they lost many of last year‘s members to
fraternities, the Nads seem to have again developed a team which is
capable of competing successfully with the best of the entries.

At this point, I wouldn't venture to offer a prediction onwhom I
expect to be leading the league at the end of the year. I would,
however, feel safe in predicting that no team will go undefeated this
year. Based on the action in the ﬁrst week. I think that this year will
deﬁnitely offer some excellent competition and surprisitig results to the

interested observer.

Albany State’s sailing club opened the fall season on a winning

Rutgers University Invitational Regatta, on the
is University in New Jersey. State won the

triangular with 68 points; Rutgers and Philadelphia Textile tied with 56 points each.

Charles Bowman, Commodore-
of Albany's club, was awarded the
honor of "Outstanding Skipper”
after winning ﬁve of seven races.
Dick Alweis won two of three
races and Glenn Faden won two
of six races.

The club was initiated Isst
spring through the efforts of
Curtis L. Hemingway of the
Astronomy and Space
Department. The response of the
student body to the idea of a
sailing organization was
enthusiastic and their initial meets
last year were very successful.

The club sees its purpose as
two-fold. It wishes to promote
botlt recreational sailing and
inter-collegiate competition. For
this reason Dr. I‘letningway has
asked that anyone interested in
either objectch of the club
contact him or any other member
of the club.

This weekend the club travels
to Cornell University for the
Upstate New York Champ nships.

Linebackers Baker Brown and
Marvin Six suited up Thursday for

YAF State

Chairman

Denounces New Left

by Linda Staszalt

James '1'. Farley, State
Chairman of Young Americans.
for Freedom, said that YAF is
concerned with what can be doan
to oppose the New Left, which be
defined as those who wtint
revolution [or the sake of
revolution during it speech last
'I'hursday.

The New Left includcs such
radical groups as Students for a
Democratic Society and the
National Mobilization against IIl('
War in Viet Nam.

I'Ir' likened the New Left to a
“New Fourth Reich“ with its
storm trooper tactics similar to
those used by llitlcr iii the
1930’s. “The New cht is further
to the Left than the Communist
party in the United States which
it considers to be conservative."

Farley said that their target is

the student as well as the
establishment. even though they
claim to be Llic studeuls' friend
"If you don't want to have to
climb over barricades to get to
class, you had better do
something now."
