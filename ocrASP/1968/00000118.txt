At Kennedy

CAPE KENNEDY (UPI)-
Doctors examined the three
Apollo 7 astronauts Monday and
announced they were ready to
go Friday on the 11-day orbital

ahakedown run of America’s
new moonship.
A team of space agency

doctors pronounced Walter Shir-
ra, 45, Don Eisele, 38, and
Walter Cunningham, 36, in
excellent shape after an exhaus-
tive 4 1/2 hour examination.

“They’re in excellent shape
and fit and ready to go," said
astronaut physician Dr. Charles
Berry.

Besides conﬁrming their phy-
sical condition, the doctors
gathered data to be compared
with the results of identical
examinations after the astro-
nauts return from their 4-
million-mile ﬂight around earth.

Physicians want to see how 11
days of exposure to weightless-
ness affects blood cells, blood
pressure and bone material.

After completing their physi-
cals, the astronauts returned to
their Apollo spacecraft trainer
for ore practice on some of the
critical parts of the first
American manned space mis-
sion in nearly two years.

The preliminary countdown on
the 22-story Saturn IB rocket
and its 16-ton spaceship
proceeded without a hitch. The
final portion of the five-day
counts begins Thursday.

The Apollo 7 mission will be
devoted almost entirely to tests
of the intricate moonship
systems that u support
three men on a 480,000-mile
roundtrip to the moon. Othe
than some routine earth photo
graphy, there are no scientifii
experiments planned.

Muskie Visits Syracuse,

Accuses

By EUGENE BLABEY

SYRACUSE, N. Y. (UPI) —
Democratic vice presidential
candidate Edmund Muskie, of
Maine, chargﬁ Monday that the
campaign of Richard M. Nixon
was more concerned with polit—
ical power than social reform."

On an upstate campaign
swing, Muskie stopped off at
Syracuse University where a

handful of hecklers forced him
to cut short a prepared speech.
However, students generally
cheered Muskie who took part
in a question and answer period
with students on main issues of
the campaign.

The hecklers, led by Peace
and Freedom party candidate
for vice president, Miss Judith
Mage, held sway on the steps
of Hendricks Hall.

A spokesman for Muskie said
the heckling was the “most per-
sistent the candidate has ever
experienced." Miss Mage used
a bullhorn and continually
shouted questions at Muskie.
She also asked him to debate
her.

The former Governor of
Maine said that “since the
heclrling was confined to a sinv
gle person I don't think it was
that bad."

“I have never encountered
such a discourteous person,"
Muskie said. in reference to
Miss Mage. When Miss Mage
persisted in her request to de-
bate Muskie he said "I never
regarded debate as a shouting
match."

On the plus side, Muskie was
continually cheered by students.

Miss Mage was scheduled to
address students Tuesday night,
but Muskie said “l won't be

here to buckle you, but

your audience gives you more
courtesy than you have shown
me."

On the question of politics,

Wallace Will Visit;'
To Speak Outdoors

By ROBERT P. LAMBERT

ALBANY, N.Y. (UPI)—A na-
tional co-ordinator for former
Gov. George Wallace of Alaba-
ma complained Monday that lo-
cal political influence kept the
third party contender from get-
ting an indoor rostrum.

James Gaylord said it is the
first time he has been prevented
from getting an indoor site for
Wallace, who is scheduled to
speak from the steps of the
State Capitol at 3 p.m. Wednes-
day.

Gaylord said he was unable
to get permission for Wallace
to speak at Union Collel;e ‘“
nearby Schenectady or at State
University of New York M A].
bany He said he also. was ad—
vised that state armories could
not be used for political rallies.

Gaylord said all attempts fail-
ed, including a roller skating
rink and the Field House at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
in Troy where militant Black
Panther Leader Eldridge Clea-
ver is set to speak the next day.

Gaylord said Charles M. Gup-
till told him he wanted to offer
the use of his facility on Route
9 north of Albany but felt it
would be unwise politically to
do so.

Wallace has been seeking in-
door speaking sites because of
a cold that has threatened his
health. He caught the cold fol-
lowing iin Ohio appearance and
was urged to avoid the out-
doors in the chilly North.

Gaylord said RPI officials told
him they didn’t want to offer
the use of the Field House be-
cause it might interfere with
the Thursday appearance of
Cleaver, who heads the new left
Peace and Freedom party.

“I feel it is a sad state of
affairs when a group of college
officials feel that it is more im-
portant for people in this area
to see and hear Mr. Cleaver
than for them to seek and hear
a presidential candidate for the
United States," Gaylord told
newsmen.

“I am concerned that people
should be so narrow minded es-
pecially since the right of free
dom of speech is so firmly
stressed in this part of the coun-
try," he said.

Wallace is expected to arrive
at Albany County Airport at
12:30 p.m. Wednesday where an
informal news conference will
be held.

He plans to leave the airport
on his chartered Electra turbo-
prop liner at 5 p.m.

The route Wallace plans to
take has not been disclosed be—
cause of security.

A counter demonstration is
planned during Wallace's speech
by civil rights groups in nearby
Academy Park.

Wallace was to have left Al-
bany for a speech at Shea Sta-
dium in New York City, but be—
cause of a court fight over the
use of the facility it was can-
celled.

Sees’68 Democratic

Race As Rescmblance ’48

By LOUIS CASSELS

WASHINGTON (UPli—Poll-
ster George Gallup, who incor-
rectly predicted that Thomas E.
Dewey would win the 1948
presidential election, said Mon-
day it was still possible for
Hubert H. Humphrey to “pull a
Harry S Truman" if he could
win back dissident Democrats.
Addressing the annual United
Press International Editors and
Publishers Conference, Gallup
said the 1968 campaign bears

striking resemblance to the
presidential race 20 years ago
when Truman, far behind in the
polls as the Democratic pres-
idential nominee, forged ahead
to beat Republican Dewey.

The big difference from 1948,
Gallup said, however, is that
Truman showed a gain in every
poll taken after Sept. 1, whereas
Humphrey “hasn't started going

up yet."
“This could turn into a very
close presidential race," if

 

Party presidential candidate
George Wallace’s “ ,L ' on
repression and his willingness
to employ social division are

more brutal, but the import of
his campaign is not far from
Mr. Nixon‘s-exploit the anxiev

ties of society for political
gain, and ignore the conse—
quences for democratic proces-

ses, social tranquility, and indi
vidual dignity."

He said the former vice presi-
dent was “concerned with po—
litical power and not social re-
form."

Humphrey can begin to win
back the dissidents in his party,
he said.

Asked whether he sees a
“danger” that candidate in the
future may wait for polls to tell
them how the public lines up on
issues before taking stands of
their own, Gallup said it may be
a good thing if they did.

“All my years in this business
have convinced me the people
are always far ahead of their
leaders," Gallup said.

“There is no hero»-no man
with great charisma in this
campaign" and as a result

there is a “lot of shifting about
by voters who favor first one
candidate and then another," he
said. “Therefore it is still
possible that Humphrey could
pull off a Harry Truman if he
can somehow win back these
dissident and defecting Demo-
crats."

Gallup discussed the uses and
abuses of public opinion surveys
at a workshop session of the
annual conference.

Gallup said "a veritable
mountain of evidence has been
accumulated to prove" that
polls showing a particular
candicate ahead do not “in-
fluence thousands of others to
‘jump on his bandwagon.”

Collins Talks
On Procedure

To Fill Ofﬁce

President Evan R. Collins
discussed the procedure to be
followed in selecting his successor
at The President’s Conference
with Students yesterday.

Collins noted that the
University Council that met last
Thursday appointed a Search
Committee of three to begin
looking for candidates for the
position.

The University Council also
made a provision for a
correspondence committee. This
committee is to be composed of
three faculty members and three
students, one of whom is to be a
graduate student.

The correspondence committee
will meet with the Search
Committee in selecting
presidential candidates. The
committees will then present the
list to the University Council.

Collins then discussed several
aspects of the University
Masterplan.

The plan reveals that the gap
between available space for
students at the University Colleges
and actual students wishing to
attend them will not be closed
until 1982.

Farley BlastsNew Left,

Compares To Hitlcrism

Con't from P~ 1

He feels that. the best
organization against this is YAF.
Young Americans for Freedom
was founded in September,1960.
in Sharon, Connecticut on the
principle that “the state is the
servant of the people." This
group calls itself the New Guard

which is also the name of its
national publication.

According to Farley YAF has
tried to exist with good taste,
dedication, determination, and
relevance, During its ‘Operation
Gratitude,‘ YAF asked people to
invite servicemen returning from
overseas into their homes, They
soon received more requests than
there were servicemen available
for the program.

The New Left looks to such
authoritarian Hitler-like figures,
charged Farley, as Mao Tsc Tung
and Che Gucvera. In June, 1968
an SDS convention was held in
Lansing, Michigan, where
according to Farley, workshops in
sabotage were held in which
members were taught how to
interrupt universities, how to
provoke police into unnecessary

other students.

As it result of the actions of
such radicals it is not certain that
the Olympics will be held in
Mexico this summer as scheduled.
The liisl llllu' the Olympics worn

Period which followed the
lecture, Farley was asked about
YAF's position on several
international issues. He said that
his is the opinion of about 92% of
the membership that we must
have the will to win in Viet Nam.

Farley says that we can win a
military victory in Vietnam,but it
must be the military not the
politicians who run the war. He
feels that the Vietnam war is as
moral as any war can be.

I’roskin is openly out to help
break up Albany’s old, corrupt
Democratic Party machine. He
states that for the last 48 years
the machine has treated the office
of district attorney as if it were an
appointive office.

Since the DA controls the
grand jury, with its investigatory
powers, it is a particularly
important position for the
maintenance or destruction of a
political machine.

The message is clear. Proskin
plans to bring the county judicial
set-up to where it belongs. He is
going to tho people illld is trying

become a viable political issue,
especially in the largely black
South End.

was asked if he would give them a

He answered that he would, and
then put some commitment into
