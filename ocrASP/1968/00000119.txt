The only effective manner the

student body can express its
desires to the other branches of
the University Community, to the
people who are not associated
with college life, and to students
of other institutions is through
the Student Association.

it would, then, stand to reason
that the Student Association
should include all the students on
this campus (Graduate students
should remain a part of S. A. until
they organize a workable
organization of their own). Under
the present system, however, the
total student body does not
belong to Student Association.
in order to belong to the
association, a student must pay

his student tax. This is not an

unfair tax, nor is it a wasted tax.
Student Association does not just
provide a voice for the student
body, but it also supports a varied
program of activities for students.

Student run concerts and

publications are, also, made
possible through the Student
Association because of the

student tax.

Non-tax paying students are
able to take advantage of the
activities arid publications of the
Student Association if they wish
to pay extra for them, but there is
no way for the Student

Association to place price

non-taxpayer.

decisions would be irrelevant if
the association only spoke for the

When Student Association does

Pueblo

To the Editor ~,

i wish to paint out one small
error which appeared in your
September 30 issue in the story
concerning the petition presented
to Central Council,

The 366 petitioners were not
all from State Quad as the ASP
reported. in trying to achieve as
random a sampling of University
opinion as can be obtained, l
circulated the petition on Dutch
and Colonial Quads, in the
Campus Center Dining room
during lunch hours and in the
lounges of the library as well as
on State Quad.

1 would also like to add that
the petition of 366 which caused
Central Council to reconsider the
Pueblo Bill, was NOT sponsored
by YAF or any other campus
political organization. The
petition was initiated out of
individual action and was signed
by independently concerned
University students.

I wish to congratulate the

ASP on its accuracy in reporting
the crux of my statement and on
its rapidity in covering the action
taken against Central Council's
Pueblo Bill No. 6869-15.

Steven Villano

Drawbacks

Dear Editor:

1 have been at Albany a little
over a year and am quite
impressed with the setup of the
University. l therefore make the
following criticisms in an effort
that i might do my part in making
campus life a little better.

i think one of the major
frustrations that every student
faces is waiting in line for buying
their new books. Part of the
trouble may lie in the fact that
teachers are changing texts. but it
seems to me that a more efficient
method can be found to sell

books. it's not unusual to go and
stand in line for an hour and a
half for one or more books. i
don't know who plans out the

a.

OIIS

system each semester, but it
appears to me that after a certain
number of years an adequate
method should havr- been found.
Suggestion: but students figure it
outn-niiiyln- a committee could
save tin.- problt-m better. Believe
me; it couldn't hurl!

Picture tliis--You have just
divcd off the low board (you‘re
itot allowed to use the high one)
in your new luxurious heated
swtnimiiig pool. You swim to the
surgace and suddenly to your
surprise you find that your nice
Universin bathing suit has just
floated l2 feet to the bottom of
the pool, probably because it hiid
no strings in it, or something. And
probably, if your waist is much
bigger than 34 you won’t even
find a swimsuit to fit. if you find
one that does go on it's probably
cut wrong. Oh, well! l'm just
wondering why not too lrtany
people use our brand new
beautiful pool. i asked the
question last year and link
again-<“Wliy is the high divmg
board off limits?" I still anxiously
await an answer.

THE DECLINE 0F REASON

Aaxehnotysm

.

by Don Sabin Jr.

 

 

The race issue, like morality,
drugs, violence, and political
viewpoints, has joined the long list
of seious social problem which
have become vulgarized,
commercialized, and radicalized.

The trend to extremism is
certainly not a surprising one, and
was prophesied some years ago.
Nevértheless,‘ it is a frightening
occurrrence, and the serious
among us must observe with
concern the noises being made by
both sides.

Polarization has set in for a
variety of reason,s noteable
among them: the evolution from
dissent to riot and now
radicalization; the death of Martin
L. King; the growing ostriicism
and weakening of such groups as

CORE and the NAACP; the
increasing attention which an
awoken an largely .acist

populace is giving to the issue; and
the “rising expectations"
phenomena as applied to the
black community.

Such are the causes, and the
effects are being seen on both
sides of the social and political
fence. The center of white
extremism, of course. is Wallace,
who appears to be riding on the
waves of white anger in both
North and South. Similarly, the
focus of black extremism is
centering on such groups as the
Black Panthers.

The Panthers, like an increasing
number of white “protection
committees" in some of our cities,
are building local militias as
defense against the oncoming
“invasions.”

What is more, the Panther-type
groups are spearheading a
campaign for separatism a
position which is becoming
increasingly attractive to the
Negro. All of these groups, black
and white, use an ideological
tripod of hate, fear and anger, and
the triangular shape of their
politics are pointed at one
another.

Such estrcmism is strengthened
by the ambivalent position of tile
liberal and moderate politicians,
and the blacks who “haVe made
it." While they try to mova away
from extremism, they are at the
same time pulled toward it for
fear of losing their influence and
power.

Even more disturbing is the
increasing number of white and
black scholars who are joing and
creating such emotional
-shibboliths as "separatism,"
“genocidal tendencies."

“Inter-colonization," “black
sexual inadequacies," and such
silly remarks as “no progress is
being made."

The rattling rhetoric of the
extremists has now permeated the
race problem to all ranks and
instituions, thus gaining the
distinction of reaching the
uncultured and profane stages,
which in turn feed the radicals.

Again, the movement from the
rational to the irrational, from
concern to emotion, was
expected. But if it continues
unabated, the reasonable among
us may find ourselves
outnumbered, and our society no
place for reasonable man.

Unfortunately, today’s

Although wary concerning the

ﬁnally subdued the American

game.

in his clever little phrases, he
tells you he has no prejudices. He
just feels a man should be able to

On The Other Hand

by Tom Ceroone and Doug Goldschmidt

 

 

it was many and many a year
ago, in a college with many a tree,
that a maiden there lived whom
you may know, by the name of
Annabel Lee; and this maiden
made of plaster white, meant
knowledge and love to me.

i was alive and she was alive, in
the college with many a tree, but
we lived with a life that was more
than life-- I and my knowledge-hie
Lee- with a life that the flabby
demons of Stone coveted her and
me.

This was the reason that, long
ago in this college with many a
tree, a wind blew out of the Rock,
chilling my plastered love Annabel
Lee; so that her higliborn van men
came and bored ill'i‘ away from
he, to shut her up in a scpulchrc
in a land with nary a tree.

And now in the sepulchre of
pale stone, pale wall, pale male,
prilc tree, reporters that which once
meant life, rcposes my love in
yellowud notes-abused and lost
Annabelle Lee; thoughts and bind
stand whitewashed now, in
wisdom the birds all flee.

in vain, vainly i did strive to
save my precious Annabel Lee,
but the demons still mad, taught
out of the past, still envying her
and me; For that was the reason
(as all men know, in this college
with nary ii tree), that the wind
came cold from Evan above,
chilling and killing my Anna and
me.

llut our life it was stronger by
far than the life of those who
were older than wry-of braver-men

than we; And neither the demons
in town up above, nor the
brothers from down deep can ever
disscver my love from the love of
the sepulchred Annabel Lee.

For her light rarely beams
without bringing me dreams, of
the college with many ii tree, but
ii dream should beam :1 better
dream, of H lush and greener treee;
but for now i will lie, in grief by
her side, my my Cromie, my
Annabel Lee. (apologies to E.A.
Poe).

Right off the top of his head,
he’ll candidly hit you with, "I
don’t hate nobody‘" or “The only
good Indian (communist or nigger
may alsdo be substituted) is a
dead Indian."

He'll tell you he wants law and
order. Tell him that he would be
of tremendous assistance to that
noble goal if he turned in, or at
least registered his musket (which
is invariably called "Old Betsy"),
and he’ll give you a slap with his
Daniel Boone comic book.

He’ll tell you that assassinations
are not fostered by the wholesale
wheeling-dealing of guns today;
that assassins would find other
methods of achieving their ends.

Picture, if you will, the sight of
Lee Harvey Oswald awaiting
President Kennedy with a
how-nnd—arrow.

This person will also likely be
afflicted with a persecution
complex. When measures are
initiated with the intention of
making black Americans merely
Americans, with no prefix, he tells
of the excurciating pain these
endeavors compel him to
withstand.

This type of conservative is, in
actuality, no conservative at all.
He is a reactionary bigot about as
American as goulash. He'll
support demagogues like George
Corley Wulllace or plain ol'
Americans like Lester Maddox. He
may tell you he's for Nixon,
maybe even wear a Nixon button,
but at least he lends tacit support
to Heir Wallace.

‘ﬁil laiective reading of
America’s great doctrines in also
amazing. He in more than likely
able to quote the second, ninth,
and tenth amendments verbatim
(if he can read), but will ignore
any section even implying
equality.

America has no place for such
authoritarian-oriented people. Nor
does it hold a place for those
whose primary ambition is
anarchy, and who pose as serious
; threat to a creative, progressive
iociety as do our six-chootin’
friends.

“Anarchers,” as Wallace so
aptly calls them, are alienated not
only from American society, but
also from human existence. The
United States was created by men
whose ideas were similar as to
what the functions of government
were to be.

institutions were created for
peaceful change, and there are
many who, as [ do, value these
institutions dearly. America is not
ii free society, nor was it ever
intended to be. But there are a
majority of us who are willing tn
be restricted slightly

Moderate changes are taken as
the will of the majority and to be
nbided by, despite our personal
preferences. Radical changes are
to be abhorred. This philosophy is
what America seems to want.

So, in passing, let me urge you
ultra-lefties to migrate to an
cnviornment more suited to your
value schemes, that liberal fascism
of the Chinese People‘s Republic.
Ultra-righties, just get the hell out

Higher Education Bill Denies
Aid To Student Demonstrators

The 1968 Higher Education
Bill, currently before Congress,
contains an anti-riot provision

which could deity federal financial
aid to campus demonstrators.

A great deal of confusion
shrouds the intent of this
provision. Opposition is already
mounting because of the threat to
academic freedom and the
possibility of subjecting students
to “triple jeopardy."

Officials of education groups
who had opposed earlier
amendments that would have
automatically denied assistance
are uncertain what the
preliminary version means.

But they are quick to voice
opposition to the general principle
of federal interference in ii
university’s internal affairs.

Home feel that withholding of
loans and graan is unfair
punishment, a third thrciit to n
demonstrator who already could
l'zicr possible court action and
school discipline.

(l).~N.Y.), who tried
unsuccessfully to kill anti-riot
amendments this summer, said he

Officers of the National
Student Association are planning
possible Icgal tests should the
provision be adopted and other
strategy.

A spokesman for the National
Association of State Universities
and Land—Grant Colleges reacted
by quoting an earlier statement
saying “threats of fiscal sanctions
will not contribute to campus

stability but will more likely
encourage more of the protests we
want to end.”

would deny federal financial
assistance to students or
employees who are “convicted of
a crime involving force,

property or who violate a
university rule if the institution
judged the offense to be serious
